The position held by M. LACROIX in the Imperial Library of\r\nthe Arsenal, Paris, is a sufficient guarantee of his qualifications for\r\nundertaking a publication of this nature. How far his labours were\r\nappreciated in France is evident from the fact that, when the first\r\nedition made its appearance, it was exhausted within a few days.\r\n\r\nIt may fairly be presumed that THE ARTS IN THE MIDDLE AGES will find\r\nequal favour in England, where so much attention has of late years been\r\ngiven to the subject in all its various ramifications; and where,--in\r\nour National Museum, Kensington, especially,--we are accumulating so\r\nextensive and valuable a collection of objects associated with the\r\nepochs referred to by M. LACROIX.\r\n\r\nIn preparing these sheets for the press, my task has been little more\r\nthan to put an excellent and conscientious _literal_ translation of the\r\nFrench text into language somewhat in harmony with the construction of\r\nour own. In so doing, however, it has been my object to retain, as far\r\nas practicable, the peculiar--sometimes the quaint--phraseology of the\r\noriginal writing. A few notes are added when they appeared necessary by\r\nway of explaining terms, &c., or to render them more intelligible to the\r\ngeneral reader. But some words are used by the Author for which no\r\nEnglish equivalent can be found: these have been allowed to stand\r\nwithout note or comment.\r\n\r\nJAMES DAFFORNE.\r\n\r\nBRIXTON, _February, 1870_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND FRENCH EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than twenty years ago we published, with the aid of our friend\r\nFerdinand Séré, whose loss we regret, and with the co-operation of other\r\nlearned men and of the most eminent writers and artists, an important\r\nwork, entitled “THE MIDDLE AGES AND THE RENAISSANCE.” That work, which\r\nconsists of no less than five large quarto volumes, treated in detail\r\nthe manners and customs, the sciences, literature, and the arts of those\r\ntwo great epochs, a subject as vast as it is interesting and\r\ninstructive. Thanks to the learning it displays, to its literary merit\r\nand its admirable execution, it had the rare good fortune to attract\r\nimmediately the attention of the public, and even now it maintains the\r\ninterest which marked its first appearance. It has taken its place in\r\nthe library of the amateur, not only in France but also among\r\nforeigners; it has become celebrated.\r\n\r\nThis exceptional result, especially as regards a publication of such\r\nextent, induces us to believe that our work, thus known and appreciated\r\nby the learned, may and ought henceforth to have still greater success\r\nby addressing itself to a yet larger number of readers.\r\n\r\nWith this conviction we now present to the public one of the principal\r\nportions of that important work, and perhaps the most interesting, in a\r\nform more simple, easier, and more pleasing; within the reach of youth\r\nwho desire to learn without weariness or irksomeness, of females\r\ninterested in grave authors, of the family that loves to assemble round\r\na book altogether instructive and attractive. We would speak of the\r\n“ARTS IN THE MIDDLE AGES, AND AT THE PERIOD OF THE RENAISSANCE.” After\r\nhaving reunited the scattered materials on this subject, we have ranged\r\nthem each in its own rank, taking care to discard all crudity of\r\nlearning and to preserve in our work the brilliant colouring in which it\r\nwas first clothed.\r\n\r\nAll the Arts are interesting in themselves. Their productions awaken\r\nattention and excite curiosity. But here it is not one Art only that is\r\ntreated of. We pass in review all the Arts, starting from the fourth\r\ncentury to the second half of the sixteenth--Architecture raising\r\nchurches and abbeys, palaces and public memorials, strong fortresses and\r\nthe ramparts of cities; Sculpture adorning and perfecting other Arts by\r\nits works in stone, marble, bronze, wood, and ivory; Painting,\r\ncommencing with mosaic and enamels, contributing to the decoration of\r\nbuildings jointly with stained glass and frescoes, embellishing and\r\nilluminating manuscripts before it arrived at its highest point of\r\nperfection, with the Art of Giotto and Raphael, of Hemling and Albert\r\nDürer; Engraving on wood and metal, with which is associated the work of\r\nthe medallist and the goldsmith; and after attempting to touch upon\r\nPlaying-cards and Niello-work, we suddenly evoke that sublime invention\r\ndestined to change the face of the world--Printing. Such are, in brief,\r\nsome of the principal features of this splendid picture. One can imagine\r\nwhat an infinity, what variety and richness, of details it should\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\nOur subject presents, at the same time, another kind of interest more\r\nelevated and not less alluring. Here each Art appears in its different\r\nphases and in its diversified progress. It is a history, not alone of\r\nthe Arts, but of the epoch itself in which they were developed; for the\r\nArts, regarded in their generality, are the truest expression of\r\nsociety. They speak to us of tastes, of ideas, of character: they\r\nexhibit us in their works. Of all an age can leave to the future\r\nconcerning itself, that which represents it most vividly is Art: the\r\nArts of an epoch revivify it, and bring it back before our eyes.\r\n\r\nIt is this which forms our book. Yet, we must remark, here its interest\r\nis redoubled, for we retrace not only a single era, but two eras very\r\ndistinct from each other. In the first, that of the Middle Ages, which\r\nfollowed the invasion of the Northmen, society was in a great measure\r\nformed of new and barbarous elements, which Christianity laboured to\r\nbreak up and fashion. In the second epoch, on the contrary, society was\r\norganised and firmly established; it enjoyed peace, and reaped its\r\nfruits. The Arts followed the same phases. At first rude and informal,\r\nthey rose slowly and by degrees, like society, out of chaos. At length\r\nthey nourished in perfect freedom, and progressed with all the energy of\r\nwhich the human mind is capable. Hence the successive advances whose\r\nhistory presents a marvellous interest.\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages, Art generally followed the inspirations of that\r\nChristian spirit which presided at the formation of this new world. It\r\narose to reproduce in an admirable manner the religious ideal. Only\r\ntowards the end of that period it searched out for beauty of form, and\r\nbegan to find it when the Renaissance made its appearance: the\r\nRenaissance, that is, the intellectual revolution, which, in the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries, restored among modern nations the\r\nsceptre to Literature and the Arts of antiquity. Then, with the\r\nRenaissance, the Arts changed their direction, and especially the\r\nprincipal Arts, those by which the genius of man expresses most forcibly\r\nhis ideas and his feelings. Thus, in the Middle Ages, a new style of\r\narchitecture is created that rapidly attained the highest degree of\r\nperfection, the _ogival_ (later Gothic or flamboyant), of which we see\r\nthe _chefs-d’œuvre_ in our cathedrals: at the Renaissance, this was\r\nreplaced by architecture derived from that of the Greeks and Romans,\r\nwhich also produced admirable works, but almost always less in harmony\r\nwith the dignity and splendour of worship. In the Middle Ages, Painting\r\nchiefly applied itself to represent the _beau idéal_ of the religious\r\nmind reflecting itself in the countenance; at the Renaissance, it is the\r\nbeauty of the physical form, so perfectly expressed by the ancients.\r\nSculpture, which comes nearer to Painting, followed at the same time all\r\nsimilar phases, drawing the art of Engraving with it. Do not the\r\ndiversified changes through which the Arts passed, as retraced in this\r\nbook during two epochs, present to the intelligent reader a succession\r\nof facts of the highest interest and a history most instructive?\r\n\r\nOur work is the only existing one on this great and magnificent subject,\r\nof which the materials are scattered through a multitude of volumes.\r\nThus for the success of this undertaking it became necessary to unite\r\nwith us in our task men most distinguished by their learning and\r\ntalents: we are permitted to cite the names of MM. Ernest Breton, Aimé\r\nChampollion, Champollion-Figeac, Pierre Dubois, Duchesne, Ferdinand\r\nDenis, Jacquemart, Arch. Juvinal, Jules Labarte, Lassus, Louandre,\r\nProsper Mérimée, Alfred Michiels, Gabriel Peignot, Riocreux, De Saulcy,\r\nJean Designeur, le Marquis de Varennes. After such a list we record our\r\nown name only to acknowledge that we have gone over and recast these\r\nvarious works, and presented them in a form which gives them more unity,\r\nbut owes to them all the interest and all the charm it may offer.\r\n\r\nThe numerous illustrations that adorn the work will engage the eye,\r\nwhile the text will speak to the intelligence. The designs in\r\nchromolithography are executed by M. Kellerhoven, who for several years\r\nhas made the art one of a high order, worthy to shine among the finest\r\nworks of our greatest painters, as is proved by his “Chefs-d’œuvre of\r\nthe Great Masters,” “Lives of the Saints,” and “Legend of St. Ursula.”\r\n\r\nNo one is ignorant of the attention given in these days to archæology.\r\nInformation about objects of antiquity is necessary to every instructed\r\nperson. It ought to be studied so far as to enable us to appreciate, or\r\nat least to recognise, the examples of olden time in Architecture,\r\nPainting, &c., that present themselves to our notice. Thus it has become\r\nfor the young of each sex indispensable to good education. The perusal\r\nof this book will be for such an attractive introduction to that\r\nknowledge which for too long a time was the exclusive domain of the\r\nlearned.\r\n\r\nPAUL LACROIX\r\n(Bibliophile

A\r\npeople essentially addicted to war and hunting,--at the best,\r\nagriculturists,--having for their temples the forests, for their\r\ndwellings huts formed out of turf and thatched with straw and branches,\r\nwould naturally be indifferent to the form and description of their\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nThen succeeded the Roman Conquest. Originally, and long subsequent to\r\nthe formation of their warlike republic, the Romans had also lived in\r\ncontempt of display, and even in ignorance of the conveniences of life.\r\nBut when they had subjugated Gaul, and had carried their victorious arms\r\nto the confines of the world, they by degrees appropriated whatever the\r\nmanners and habits of the conquered nations disclosed to them of refined\r\nluxury, material progress, and ingenious devices for comfort. Thus, the\r\nRomans brought with them into Gaul what they elsewhere had acquired.\r\nAgain, when, in their turn, the semi-barbarous hordes of Germany and of\r\nthe Northern steppes invaded the Roman empire, these new conquerors did\r\nnot fail to accommodate themselves instinctively to the social condition\r\nof the vanquished.\r\n\r\nThis, briefly stated, is an explanation--we admit, rather concise--of\r\nthe transition connecting the characteristics of the society of olden\r\ndays with those of modern society.\r\n\r\nSociety in the Middle Ages--that social epoch which may be compared to\r\nthe state of a decrepid and worn-out old man, who, after a long, dull\r\ntorpor awakes to new life, like an active and vigorous child--society in\r\nthe Middle Ages inherited much from preceding times, though, to a\r\ncertain extent, they were disconnected. It transformed, perhaps; and it\r\nperfected, rather than invented; but it displayed in its works a genius\r\nso peculiar that we generally recognise in it a real creation.\r\n\r\nProposing rapidly to pursue our archæological and literary course\r\nthrough a twofold period of birth and revival, we cannot indulge the\r\nbelief that we shall succeed in exhibiting our sketches in a light the\r\nbest adapted to their effect. However, we will make the attempt, and,\r\nthe frame being given, will do our best to fill in the picture.\r\n\r\nIf we visit any royal or princely abode of the Merovingian period, we\r\nobserve that the display of wealth consists much less in the elegance or\r\nin the originality of the forms devised for articles of furniture, than\r\nin the profusion of precious materials employed in their fabrication and\r\nembellishment. The time had gone by when the earliest tribes of Gauls\r\nand of Northmen, who came to occupy the West, had for their seats and\r\nbeds only trusses of straw, rush mats, and bundles of branches; and for\r\ntheir tables slabs of stone or piles of turf. From the fifth century of\r\nthe Christian era, we already find the Franks and the Goths resting\r\ntheir muscular forms on the long soft seat which the Romans had adopted\r\nfrom the East, and which have become our sofas or our couches; changing\r\nonly their names. In front of them were arranged low horse-shoe tables,\r\nat which the centre seat was reserved for the most dignified or\r\nillustrious of the guests. Couches at the table, suited only to the\r\neffeminacy induced by warm climates, were soon abandoned by the Gauls;\r\nbenches and stools were adopted by these most active and vigorous men;\r\nmeals were no longer eaten reclining, but sitting: while the thrones of\r\nkings, and the chairs of state for nobles, were of the richest\r\nsumptuousness. Thus, for instance, we find St. Eloi, the celebrated\r\nworker in metals, manufacturing and embellishing two state-chairs of\r\ngold for Clotaire, and a throne of gold for Dagobert. The chair ascribed\r\nto St. Eloi, and known as the Fauteuil de Dagobert (Fig. 1), is an\r\nantique consular chair, which originally was only a folding one; the\r\nAbbé Suger, in the twelfth century, added to it the back and arms.\r\nArtistic display was equally lavished on the manufacture of tables.\r\nHistorians tell us that St. Remy, a contemporary of Clovis, had a silver\r\ntable decorated all over with sacred subjects. The poet Fortunat, Bishop\r\nof Poitiers, describes a table of the same metal, which had a border\r\nrepresenting a vine with bunches of grapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--The Curule Chair called the “Fauteuil de\r\nDagobert,” in gilt bronze, now in the Musée des Souverains.]\r\n\r\nComing to the reign of Charlemagne, we find, in a passage in the\r\nwritings of Eginhard, his minister and historian, that, in addition to a\r\ngolden table which this great monarch possessed, he had three others of\r\nchased silver; one decorated with designs representing the city of Rome,\r\nanother Constantinople, and the third “all countries of the universe.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Chair of the Ninth or Tenth Century, taken from\r\na Miniature of that period (MS. de la Bibl. Imp. de Paris).]\r\n\r\nThe chairs or seats of the Romanesque period (Fig. 2) exhibit an attempt\r\nto revive in the interior of the buildings, where they were used, the\r\narchitectural style of contemporary monuments. They were large and\r\nmassive, and were raised on clusters of columns expanding at the back in\r\nthree semicircular rows. The anonymous monk of Saint-Gall, in his\r\nchronicle written in the ninth century, alludes to a grand banquet, at\r\nwhich the host was seated on cushions of feathers. Legrand d’Aussy tells\r\nus, in his “Histoire de la Vie Privée des Français,” that at a later\r\ndate--referring to the reign of Louis le Gros, in the beginning of the\r\ntwelfth century--the guests were seated, at ordinary family repasts, on\r\nsimple stools; but if the party was more of a ceremonious than intimate\r\ncharacter, the table was surrounded with benches, or _bancs_, whence the\r\nterm banquet is derived. The form of table was commonly long and\r\nstraight, but on occasions of state it was semicircular, or like a\r\nhorse-shoe in form, recalling the Romanesque round table of King Artus\r\nof Brittany (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Round Table of King Artus of Brittany, from a\r\nMiniature of the Fourteenth Century (MS. de la Bibl. Imp. de Paris).]\r\n\r\nThe Crusades, bringing together men of all the countries of Europe with\r\nthe people of the East, made those of the West acquainted with luxuries\r\nand customs which, on returning from their chivalrous expeditions, they\r\ndid not fail to imitate. We find feasts at which they ate sitting\r\ncross-legged on the ground, or stretched out on carpets in the Oriental\r\nfashion, as represented and described in miniatures contained in the\r\nmanuscripts of that period. The Sire de Joinville, the friend and\r\nhistorian of Louis IX., informs us that this saintly king was in the\r\nhabit of sitting on a carpet, surrounded by his barons, and in that\r\nmanner he dispensed justice; but at the same time the practice of using\r\nlarge _chaires_, or arm-chairs, continued, for there still is to be seen\r\na throne in massive wood belonging to that period, and called _le banc\r\nde Monseigneur St. Louis_, embellished with carvings representing\r\nfanciful and legendary birds and animals. It is unnecessary to add that\r\nthe lower orders did not aspire to so much refinement. In their abodes\r\nthe seats in use were settles, chests, or at best benches, the supports\r\nof which were, to a slight extent, carved.\r\n\r\nThis was the period when the practice commenced of covering seats with\r\nwoollen stuffs, or with silk figured on frames, or embroidered by hand,\r\ndisplaying ciphers, emblems, or armorial bearings. From the East was\r\nintroduced the custom of hangings for rooms, composed of glazed leather,\r\nstamped and gilt. These skins of the goat or sheep were called _or\r\nbasané_, because plain gilt; or embossed leather, in gold colour, was\r\nmade from them. _Or basané_ was also used to conceal the bare look of\r\narm-chairs. Towards the fourteenth century, tables of precious metals\r\ndisappeared, in consequence of fashion ruling in favour of the stuffs\r\nwhich covered them; tapestry, tissues of gold, and velvets thenceforth\r\nformed the table-cloths. On great occasions, the place of the principal\r\nguests was distinguished by a canopy, more or less rich, erected above\r\ntheir seats, as represented in the account of the sumptuous feast given\r\nby King Charles V. to the Emperor Charles of Luxemburg, in the great\r\nhall of the palace. M. Fréguier thus describes the banquet from\r\ncontemporary documents in the “Histoire de l’Administration de la Police\r\nde Paris:”--\r\n\r\n“The dinner was served on a marble table. The Archbishop of Rheims, who\r\nhad officiated that day, first took his place at table. The Emperor then\r\nsat down, then the King of France, and the King of Bohemia, the son of\r\nthe Emperor. Above the seat of each of the three princes was a separate\r\ncanopy of gold cloth, embroidered all over with fleurs-de-lis. These\r\nthree canopies were surmounted by a larger one, also of cloth of gold,\r\nwhich covered the whole extent of the table, and was suspended behind\r\nthe guests. After the King of Bohemia, three bishops took their place,\r\nbut far removed from him, and near the end of the table. Under the\r\nnearest canopy the Dauphin was seated, at a separate table, with several\r\nprinces or nobles of the Court of France, or of the Emperor. The hall\r\nwas adorned with three buffets, or dressers, covered with gold and\r\nsilver plate; these three dressers, as well as the two large canopies,\r\nwere protected by a railing, to prevent the intrusion of the crowds of\r\npeople who had been permitted to witness the magnificence of the\r\ndisplay. Finally, there were to be seen five other canopies, under which\r\nwere assembled princes and barons round private tables; also numerous\r\nother tables.”\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that from the time of St. Louis these same chairs and\r\nseats, carved, covered with the richest stuffs, inlaid with precious\r\nstones, and engraved with the armorial bearings of great houses, issued\r\nfor the most part from the workshops of Parisian artisans. Those\r\nartisans, carpenters, manufacturers of coffers and carved chests, and\r\nfurniture-makers, were so celebrated for works of this description, that\r\nin inventories and appraisements of furniture great care was taken to\r\nspecify that such and such articles among them were of Parisian\r\nmanufacture; _ex operagio Parisiensi_ (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Louis IX. represented in his Regal Chair,\r\ntapestried in fleurs-de-lis, from a Miniature of the Fourteenth Century.\r\n(MS. de la Bibl. Imp. de Paris.).]\r\n\r\nThe following extract, from an invoice of Etienne La Fontaine, the royal\r\nsilversmith, affords, in terms which require no comment, an idea of the\r\ncostliness lavished on the manufacture of an arm-chair, then called\r\n_faudesteuil_, intended for the King of France, in 1352:--\r\n\r\n“For making a fauteuil of silver and of crystal decorated with precious\r\nstones, delivered to the said seigneur, of which the said seigneur\r\nordered the said goldsmith to make the framework, who ornamented it\r\nwith several crystals, illuminated pieces, many designs, pearls, and\r\nother stones.... VIIᶜ LXXIIIIᵐ (774 louis).\r\n\r\n“For illuminated pieces placed under the crystals of the said fauteuil,\r\nof which there are 40 of the armorial bearings of France, 61 of the\r\nprophets holding scrolls, 112 half-length figures of animals on gold\r\nground, and 4 large representations of the judgments of Solomon....\r\nVIˣˣᵐ (620 louis).\r\n\r\n“For twelve crystals for the said fauteuil, of which five are hollow to\r\nhold the bâtons, six flat, and one round,” &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Seats from Miniatures of the Fourteenth and\r\nFifteenth Centuries.]\r\n\r\nIt was only towards the commencement of the fifteenth century that\r\nchairs stuffed with straw or rushes first appeared; they folded in the\r\nform of the letter X (Fig. 5); the seats and arms being stuffed. In the\r\nsixteenth century chairs with backs (_chaires_ or _chayeres à\r\ndorseret_), in carved oak or chestnut, painted and gilt, fell into\r\ndisuse, even in the royal castles, as being too heavy and inconvenient,\r\nand on account of their enormous size (Figs. 6 and 7).\r\n\r\nThe dresser, which has just been described as used at the grand feast of\r\nCharles V., and which moreover has been retained, altered to a sideboard\r\nwith shelves, almost to our time, was an article manufactured much less\r\nfor use than for show. It was upon this dresser,--the introduction of\r\nwhich does not appear to go further back than the twelfth century, and\r\nthe name whereof sufficiently describes its purpose,--that there was\r\ndisplayed, in the vast halls of manorial residences, not only all the\r\nvaluable plate required for the table, but many other objects of\r\ngoldsmith’s work which played no part in the banquet--vases of all\r\nsorts, statuettes, figures in high relief, jewels,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Christine de Pizan, contemporary with Charles V.\r\nand Charles VI., seated on a Chair in carved wood with back and canopy,\r\nand tapestry of worsted or figured silk. The box or chest which formed\r\nthe writing-table contained books. (Miniature from a MS. in the Bibl. of\r\nBurgundy-Bruxelles, Fifteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nand even reliquaries. In palaces and mansions, the dressers were of\r\ngold, silver, or copper gilt; as were previously the tables. Persons of\r\ninferior rank had only wooden tables, but they were scrupulous in\r\ncovering them with tapestry, embroidered cloth, and fine table-cloths.\r\nAt one time the display of wealth on the dressers in ecclesiastical\r\nestablishments attained to such a point, that we are reminded, among\r\nother censures levelled against that fashionable exhibition of vanity,\r\nof the expostulations of Martial d’Auvergne, author of the historical\r\npoem, “Les Vigiles de Charles VII.,” addressed to the bishops on the\r\nsubject. One item significant enough is mentioned in ancient documents;\r\nit is the tribute of half-a-dozen small bouquets, which the inhabitants\r\nof Chaillot were bound to tender annually to the Abbey of Saint-German\r\ndes Prés, to decorate the dressers of Messire the Abbot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Louise de Savoie, Duchess of Angoulême, mother\r\nof Francis I., seated in a high-backed Chair of carved wood. (Miniature\r\nfrom a MS. in the Imp. Bibl. of Paris.)]\r\n\r\nMore plain, but also more useful, were the _abace_ and the _crédence_,\r\nother kinds of sideboards which generally stood at a little distance\r\nfrom the table; on one of these were placed the dishes and plates for\r\nremoves, on the other the goblets, glasses, and cups. It may be added\r\nthat the _crédence_, before it was introduced in the dining-halls, had\r\nfrom very remote times been used in churches, where it was placed near\r\nthe altar to receive the sacred vessels during the sacrifice of mass.\r\n\r\nPosidonius, the Stoic philosopher, who wrote about a hundred years\r\nbefore the Christian era, tells us that, at the feasts of the Gauls, a\r\nslave used to bring to table an earthenware, or a silver, jug filled\r\nwith wine, from which every guest quaffed in turn, and allayed his\r\nthirst. We thus see the practice of using goblets of silver, as well as\r\nof earthenware, established among the Gauls at a period we consider\r\nprimitive. In truth, those vessels of silver were probably not the\r\nproductions of local industry, but the spoil which those martial tribes\r\nhad acquired in their wars against more civilised nations. With regard\r\nto the vases of baked clay, the majority of those frequently exhumed\r\nfrom burial-grounds prove how coarse they were, though they seem to have\r\nbeen made with the help of the potter’s wheel, as among the Romans.\r\nHowever that may be, we think it best to omit the consideration of the\r\nquestion in this place, and to resume it in the chapter on the Ceramic\r\nArt. But we must not forget to notice the custom which prevailed among\r\nthe earliest inhabitants of our country, of offering to those most\r\nrenowned for their valour beverages in a horn of the _urus_, which was\r\neither gilt or ornamented with bands of gold or silver. The _urus_ was a\r\nspecies of ox, now extinct, that existed in a wild state in the forests\r\nwith which Gaul was then partly covered. This horn goblet long continued\r\nto be the emblem of the highest warlike dignity among the nations who\r\nsucceeded the Gauls. William of Poitiers relates, in his “Histoire de\r\nGuillaume le Conquérant,” that towards the end of the eleventh century,\r\nthis Duke of Normandy still drank out of the horn of a bull, when he\r\nheld his full court at Fécamp.\r\n\r\nOur ancient kings, whose tables were made of the most precious metals,\r\nfailed not also to display rare magnificence in the plate that stood on\r\nthose superb tables. Chroniclers relate, for example, that Chilperic,\r\n“on the pretext of doing honour to the people whom he governed, had a\r\ndish made of solid gold, ornamented all over with precious stones, and\r\nweighing fifty pounds;” and again, that Lothaire one day distributed\r\namong his soldiers the fragments of an enormous silver basin, on which\r\nwas designed “the world, with the courses of the stars and the planets.”\r\nIn the absence of any authentic documents, it must be presumed that, in\r\ncontrast to this regal style, or rather far removed therefrom, the rest\r\nof the nation scarcely used any other utensils but those of earthenware,\r\nor wood; or else of iron or copper.\r\n\r\nAdvancing in the course of centuries, and till the period when the\r\nprogress of the ceramic art enabled its productions at length to rank\r\namong articles of luxury, we find gold and silver always preferred for\r\ndinner services; but marble, rock crystal, and glass appeared in turn,\r\nartistically worked in a thousand elegant or singular forms, as cups,\r\newers, large tumblers, goblets, &c. (Fig 8).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--A State Banquet in the Fifteenth Century, with\r\nthe service of dishes brought in and handed round to the sound of\r\nmusical instruments. (Miniature from a MS. in the Imp. Lib. in Paris.)]\r\n\r\nTo the goblet, especially, seem to belong all honorary privileges in the\r\netiquette of the table; for the goblet, a sort of large chalice on a\r\nthin stem, was more particularly regarded as an object of distinction by\r\nthe guests, on account of the supposed antiquity of its origin. Thus we\r\nsee represented among the presents given to the Abbey of St. Denis by\r\nthe Emperor Charles the Bald, a goblet which is alleged to have belonged\r\nto Solomon, “which goblet was so marvellously wrought, that never\r\n(_oncques_) was there in all the kingdoms of the world a work so\r\ndelicate (_subtile_).”\r\n\r\nThe goldsmiths, sculptors, and workers in copper had recourse to all\r\nthe devices of art and imagination to embellish goblets, ewers, and\r\nsalt-cellars. We find allusions, in the recitals of chroniclers, the\r\nromances of chivalry, and especially in old invoices and inventories, to\r\newers representing men, roses, and dolphins; to goblets covered with\r\nflowers and animals; to salt-cellars in the form of dragons, &c.\r\n\r\nSeveral large pieces of gold plate, discontinued at a later period,\r\nglittered then at grand banquets. Especially may be noted the portable\r\nfountains raised in the middle of the table, and from which, during the\r\nrepast, flowed several sorts of beverages. Philip the Good, Duke of\r\nBurgundy, had one in the form of a fortress with towers, from the summit\r\nof which the figure of a woman poured out hippocras (spiced wine) from\r\nher bosom, and that of a child, which sprinkled perfumed water.\r\n\r\nThere were also plate-holders, well described by Du Cange as large\r\ndishes made to contain vessels, cups, knives; comfit-boxes, which have\r\nbeen replaced by our modern _bonbonnières_, and which formerly were\r\nvaluable caskets chased and damaskeened; and lastly, almsboxes, a\r\ndescription of metal-urns, richly chased; these were placed before the\r\nguests in order that, according to an ancient custom, each might place\r\ntherein some portions of meat, to be subsequently distributed to the\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nIf we glance at the other minor objects which completed the\r\ntable-service--knives, spoons, forks, bottle-stands, plate-mats, &c.--we\r\nshall see that they no less indicate refinement and luxury. Forks, that\r\nnow seem to us so indispensable, are mentioned for the first time in\r\n1379, in an inventory of Charles V. They had only two prongs, or rather\r\ntwo long sharp points. As for knives, which, with spoons, had to supply\r\nthe place of forks for the guests to eat with, their antiquity is\r\nundoubted. Posidonius, whom we have already quoted, says, when speaking\r\nof the Celts:--“They eat in a very slovenly manner, and seize with their\r\nhands, like lions with their claws, whole quarters of meat, which they\r\ntear in pieces with their teeth. If they find a tough morsel, they cut\r\nit with a small knife which they always carry in a sheath at their\r\nside.” Of what were these knives made? Our author does not tell us; but\r\nwe may assume that they were of flint or of polished stone, like the\r\nhatchets and arrow-heads so frequently found where these ancient people\r\ndwelt, and which bear testimony to their industry.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century mention is made of knives, under the name of\r\n_mensaculæ_ and _artavi_, which a little later were known by the word\r\n_kenivet_, from which evidently is derived _canif_. To complete this\r\nconnection, we may remark that it is to be gathered, from a passage by\r\nthe same author, that the blades of some knives of that period were made\r\nto slide into the handle by means of a spring, like our pocket-knives.\r\n\r\nSpoons, which necessarily were used by all nations as soon as dishes\r\nmore or less liquid were introduced, are described from the date of\r\nalmost our earliest history. Accordingly, we see, in the “Life of St.\r\nRadegonde,” that that princess, who was constantly engaged in charitable\r\nacts, used a spoon for feeding the blind and the helpless whom she took\r\nunder her care.\r\n\r\nAt a very remote period we find in use _turquoises_, or nut-crackers.\r\nCruet-stands were, excepting in form, very similar to stands for two\r\nbottles; for they are thus described:--“A kind of double-necked bottle\r\nin divisions, in which to place two sorts of liquors without mixing\r\nthem.” The plate-mats were our _dessous de plat_, made of wicker, wood,\r\ntin, or other metal.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of the greater number of these articles, if intended for\r\npersons of rank, did not fail to engage the industry of artisans and the\r\ntalent of artists. Spoons, forks, nut-crackers, cruet-stands,\r\nsauce-boats, &c., furnished inexhaustible subjects for embellishment and\r\nchasing; knife-handles, made of ivory, cedar-wood, gold, or silver, were\r\nalso fashioned in the most varied forms. Until ceramic art introduced\r\nplates more or less costly, they naturally enough followed the shape of\r\ndishes, which in fact they are, on a small scale. But if the dishes were\r\nof enormous size, the plates were always very small.\r\n\r\nIf from the dining-room we pass to the kitchen, so as to form some idea\r\nof culinary utensils, we must admit that, anterior to the thirteenth\r\ncentury, the most circumstantial documents are all but silent on the\r\nsubject. Nevertheless, some of the ancient poets and early romancers\r\nallude to those huge mechanical spits on which, at one and the same\r\ntime, large joints of different kinds, entire sheep, or long rows of\r\npoultry and game, could be roasted. Moreover, we know that in palaces,\r\nand in the mansions of the nobility, copper cooking-utensils possessed\r\nreal importance, because the care and maintenance of the copper-ware was\r\nentrusted to a person who bore the title of _maignen_, a name still\r\ngiven to the itinerant tinker. We also find that from the twelfth\r\ncentury there existed the corporation of braziers (_dinans_), who\r\nexecuted historical designs, in relievo, by the use of the hammer in\r\nbeating out and embossing copper,--designs that would bear comparison\r\nwith the most elaborate works produced by the goldsmith’s art. Some of\r\nthese artisans obtained such reputation that their names have descended\r\nto us. Jean d’Outremeuse, Jean Delamare, Gautier de Coux, Lambert\r\nPatras, were among those who conferred honour on the art of brazier’s\r\nwork (_dinanderie_).\r\n\r\nFrom the kitchen to the cellar the distance is usually but short. Our\r\nforefathers, who were large consumers, and in their way had a delicate\r\nappreciation, of the juice of the vine, understood how to store the\r\nbarrels which contained their wines in deep and spacious vaults. The\r\ncooper’s art, when almost unknown in Italy and Spain, had existed for a\r\nlong time in France, as is attested by a passage taken from the\r\n“Mémoires de l’Académie des Inscriptions:”--“We see by the text of the\r\nSalic law that, when an estate changed hands, the new proprietor gave,\r\nin the first place, a feast, and the guests were bound to eat, in the\r\npresence of witnesses, a plate of boiled minced meat. It is remarked in\r\nthe ‘Glossaire de Du Cange’ that, among the Saxons and Flemings, the\r\nword _boden_ means a round table; because the peasantry used the bottom\r\nof a barrel as a table. Tacitus says that for the first meal of the day\r\nthe Germans had each their own table; that is to say, apparently a full\r\nor empty barrel placed on end.”\r\n\r\nA statute of Charlemagne alludes to _bons barils_ (_bonos barridos_).\r\nThese barrels were made by skilled coopers (Fig. 9), who gave all their\r\ncare to form of staves, hooped either with wood or iron, the casks\r\ndestined to hold the produce of the vintage. According to an old custom,\r\nstill in vogue in the south of France, the inside of the wine-skin used\r\nto be painted with tar, in order to give a flavour to the wine; to us\r\nthis would perhaps be nauseous, but at that time it was held in high\r\nfavour. In alluding to wine-skins, or sewn skins coated with pitch, we\r\nmay remark that they date from the earliest historic times. They are\r\nstill employed in countries where wine is carried on pack-animals, and\r\nthey were much used for journeys. If a traveller was going into a\r\ncountry where he expected to find nothing to drink, he would fasten a\r\nwine-skin on the crupper of his horse’s saddle, or, at least, would\r\nsling a small leather wine-skin across his shoulder. Etymologists even\r\nmaintain that from the name of these light wine-skins, _outres légères_,\r\nwas derived the old French word _bouteille_; that, first having been\r\ndesignated _bouchiaux_, and _boutiaux_, they finally were named\r\n_bouties_ and _boutilles_. When, in the thirteenth century, the Bishop\r\nof Amiens was setting out for the wars, the tanners of his episcopal\r\ntown were bound to supply him with two leathern _bouchiaux_--one holding\r\na hogshead, the other twenty-four _setiers_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--A Cooper’s Workshop, drawn and engraved, in the\r\nSixteenth Century, by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nSome archæologists maintain that, when there had been a very abundant\r\nvintage, the wine was stored in brick-built cisterns, such as are still\r\nmade in Normandy for cider; or that they were cut out of the solid rock,\r\nas we see them sometimes in the south of France; but it is more probable\r\nthat these ancient cisterns, which are perhaps of an earlier date than\r\nthe Middle Ages, were more especially intended for the process of\r\nfermentation--that is to say, for making wine, and not for storing it;\r\nwhich, indeed, under such unfavourable circumstances, would have been\r\nnext to impossible.\r\n\r\nWhat light did our ancestors use? History tells us that at first they\r\nused lamps with stands, and hanging lamps, in imitation of the Romans;\r\nwhich, however, must not lead us to the conclusion that, even in the\r\nremotest times of our annals, the use of fat and wax for such purposes\r\nwas absolutely unknown. This fact is the less doubtful because, from the\r\ntime when trade corporations were formed, we find the makers of candles\r\nand wax-chandlers\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 10 and 11.--Hanging Lamps of the Ninth Century,\r\nfrom Miniatures in the Bible of Charles the Bald (Bibl. Imp. de Paris).]\r\n\r\nof Paris governed by certain statutes. As for the lamps, which, as in\r\nancient times, were on stands placed for this purpose in the houses, or\r\nwere suspended by light chains (Figs. 10 and 11), they were made in\r\naccordance with the means of those for whom they were intended, and were\r\nof baked earth, iron, brass, and gold or silver, all more or less\r\nornamented. Lamps and candlesticks are not unfrequently mentioned in the\r\ninventories of the Middle Ages. In the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies, German artisans made torch-holders, flambeaux, and\r\nchandeliers in copper, wrought and embellished with representations of\r\nall kinds of natural or fantastic objects; and in those days these works\r\nof art were much in request. The use of lamps was all but general in the\r\nearly days of the monarchy; but as the somewhat dim and smoky flame\r\nwhich they furnished did not give sufficient brilliancy to the\r\nentertainments and solemn assemblies held in the evening, it became an\r\nestablished custom to add to these lamps the light of resinous torches,\r\nwhich serfs held in their hands. The tragic episode of the Ballet des\r\nArdents, as told by Froissart--which we shall hereafter relate in the\r\nchapter on Playing Cards--shows that this custom, which we already see\r\nalluded to in Grégoire de Tours, our earliest historian, was in fashion\r\nuntil the reign of Charles VI.\r\n\r\nIn subjugating the East, the Romans assumed and brought back with them\r\nextreme notions of luxury and indolence. Previously their bedsteads were\r\nof planks, covered with straw, moss, or dried leaves. They borrowed from\r\nAsia those large carved bedsteads, gilt and plated with ivory, whereon\r\nwere piled cushions of wool and feathers, with counterpanes of the most\r\nbeautiful furs and of the richest materials.\r\n\r\nThese customs, like many others, were handed down from the Romans to the\r\nGauls, and from the Gauls to the Franks. With the exception of\r\nbed-linen, which came into use much later, we find, from the time of our\r\nearliest kings, the various sleeping appliances nearly as they are\r\nnow--the pillow (_auriculare_), the foot-coverlet (_lorale_), the\r\ncounterpane (_culcita_), &c. No mention, however, is made of curtains\r\n(or _courtines_).\r\n\r\nAt a later period, while still retaining their primitive furniture,\r\nbedsteads vary in their shapes and dimensions: those of the poor and of\r\nthe monks are narrow and homely; among kings and nobles they, in process\r\nof time, became veritable examples of the joiner’s work, and only to be\r\nreached by the aid of stools, or even steps (Fig. 12). The guest at a\r\nchâteau could not receive any greater honour than to occupy the same bed\r\nas the lord of the manor; and the dogs by whom the seigneurs--all great\r\nsportsmen--were constantly surrounded had the privilege of reposing\r\nwhere their masters slept. Hence we recognise the object of these\r\ngigantic bedsteads, which were sometimes twelve feet in width. If we are\r\nto believe the chronicles, the pillows were perfumed with essences and\r\nodoriferous waters; this we can understand to have been by no means a\r\nuseless precaution. We see, in the sixteenth century, Francis I.\r\ntestifying his great regard for Admiral Bonnivet by occasionally\r\nadmitting him to share his bed.\r\n\r\nHaving completed our review of furniture, properly so called, we have\r\nnow to treat of that which may be termed highly artistic articles of\r\nfurniture--that is, those on which the workers in wood exercised their\r\nhighest talents--elevated seats of honour, chairs and arm-chairs,\r\nbenches and trestles; all of which were frequently ornamented with\r\nfigures in relief, very elaborately sculptured with a knife (_canivet_);\r\nthe _bahuts_, a kind of chest with either a flat or convex top, resting\r\non feet, and opening on the upper side, whereon were placed stuffed\r\nleather cushions (Fig. 13); tubs, buffets,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Bed furnished with Canopy and Curtains, from a\r\nMiniature at the end of the Fourteenth Century. (MS. de la Bibl. Imp. de\r\nParis.)]\r\n\r\npresses, coffers both large and small, chess-boards, dice-tables,\r\ncomb-boxes, which have been superseded by our dressing-cases, &c. Many\r\nspecimens of these various kinds of furniture have descended to our\r\ntime; and they prove to what a degree of perfection and of elaborate\r\nfinish the art of cabinet-making and of inlaying had attained in the\r\nMiddle Ages. Elegance and originality of design in inlaid metals,\r\njasper, mother-of-pearl, ivory; carving, various kinds of veneering, and\r\nof stained woods, are all found combined in this description of\r\nfurniture; some of which was ornamented with extreme delicacy of taste\r\n(Plate I.), and still remains inimitable, if not in all the details of\r\nexecution, at least in rich and harmonious effect.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Renaissance, cabinets with numerous drawers and in\r\nseveral compartments were introduced: these were known in Germany by the\r\nname of artistic cabinets (_armoires artistiques_): the sole object of\r\nthe maker was to combine in one piece of furniture, under the pretext of\r\nutility, all the fascination and gorgeous caprices of decorative art.\r\n\r\nTo the Germans must be awarded the merit of having been the first to\r\ndistinguish themselves in the manufacture of these magnificent cabinets,\r\nor presses; but they soon found rivals in both the French (Fig. 14) and\r\nItalians (Fig. 15), who proved themselves equally skilful and ingenious\r\nin the execution of this kind of manufacture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     Fig. 13.--Chest shaped like a Bed, standing in front of a\r\n     Fireplace, and a Chair with cushions, in carved wood, from\r\n     Miniatures of the Fifteenth Century. (Bibl. Roy. de Bruxelles.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe art of working in iron, which can legitimately rank as one of the\r\nmost notable industries of the Middle Ages, soon came to lend its aid to\r\nthat of cabinet-making, both in embellishing and giving solidity to its\r\n_chefs-d’œuvre_. The ornamentation of cabinets and coffers was\r\nremarkable for the good taste and the high finish displayed in them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTAFF OF WOOD, Turned and Carved. Sixteenth Century.\r\nSize of the Original.]\r\n\r\nIn the hands of skilful artisans, of unknown artists dating from the\r\ntwelfth to the sixteenth century, iron seemed to assume great\r\nductility--indeed, we might say unprecedented submission. Observe, in\r\nthe gratings of courtyards, in the iron-work of gates, how those lines\r\nare interlaced, how attractive are those designs, how those wrought\r\nstems are delicately lengthened out, at once strong but light, and\r\nfinally how they expand with natural grace into leaves, fruits, and\r\nsymbolic figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Small Cabinet for Jewels, in carved wood, after\r\nthe style of Jean Goujon, from the Château d’Ecouen, and which formerly\r\nbelonged to the Montmorency family. (In the Collection of M. Double.)]\r\n\r\nMoreover, the workers in metal did not confine themselves to the\r\napplication of iron on articles already prepared and manufactured by\r\nother artisans; they had also to originate and execute, to ornament\r\ncaskets and reliquaries: but their special art was to manufacture bolts\r\n(Fig. 16), locks, and keys; examples of this kind of ancient work will\r\nalways be admired. “Locks,” says M. Jules Labarte, “were at that time\r\ncarried to such a degree of perfection, that they were considered as\r\nveritable objects of art; they were carried from place to place, as\r\nwould have been done with any other valuable article of furniture.\r\nNothing could be more artistic than the figures in high relief, the\r\narmorial bearings, the letterings, the ornaments and the engravings\r\nwhich embellished that portion of the key which the fingers grasp (Fig.\r\n17), and for which we have substituted a common ring.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Cabinet in Damaskeened Iron, inlaid with gold\r\nand silver. An Italian work of the Sixteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nGlass and glazing claim particular notice. It may be said that glass was\r\nknown in the remotest ages, for Phœnicia and ancient Egypt were, in the\r\ntime of Moses, renowned for their innumerable productions in vitrified\r\nsand. In Rome they cast, cut, and engraved glass--they even worked it\r\nwith the hammer, if we are to believe Suetonius, who relates that a\r\ncertain artist had discovered the secret of making glass malleable. This\r\nindustrial art, which extended and improved under the emperors, found\r\nits way to Byzantium, where it flourished during several centuries;\r\nuntil Venice, claiming as she then did a prominent position in the\r\nhistory of the arts, imported the process of the Byzantine method of\r\nmaking glass, and in her turn excelled in this manufacture. Although\r\narticles in glass and crystal, painted, enamelled, and engraved, are\r\nfrequently alluded to in historical and poetical narratives, and also in\r\nthe inventories of the Middle Ages, we know they were all the result of\r\nGreek or Venetian manufacture. In this art France especially seems to\r\nhave been somewhat late in taking her first artistic step; such\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Bolt of the Sixteenth Century, with Initial of\r\nHenry II.\r\n\r\n(In the Castle of Chenonceaux.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Key of the Thirteenth Century, with two Figures\r\nof Chimeras, back to back.\r\n\r\n(Soltykoff Collection.)]\r\n\r\nobjects as were manufactured for the use of the rich never passed beyond\r\nthe limits of the rudest art. We should, however, observe that France\r\nmust have long been acquainted with the art of glazing, for in the\r\nmiddle of the seventh century we find St. Benoît--called Biscop, who\r\nbuilt so many churches and convents in England--coming to France in\r\nsearch of workmen for the purpose of glazing the church and the\r\ncloisters of his abbey at Canterbury. And it is also mentioned in the\r\nchronicles of the Venerable Bede, that the French taught their art to\r\nthe English glaziers.\r\n\r\nTowards the fourteenth century the windows of even the commonest houses\r\nwere generally glazed; at that date glass manufactories were found in\r\noperation everywhere; and although they may not have rivalled in a\r\nremarkable degree their predecessors of the Merovingian period, they\r\nnevertheless made in large quantities all kinds of articles ordinarily\r\nin use, as we can judge by the terms of a charter, dated 1338, by which\r\none Guionnet, in order to have the privilege of establishing a glass\r\nfactory in the forest of Chambarant, was bound to furnish as an annual\r\ndue to his seigneur, Humbert, Dauphin of Viennois, one hundred dozen\r\nglasses in the shape of a bell, twelve dozen small shallow glasses,\r\ntwenty dozen goblets, twelve dozen amphoræ, twenty dozen lamps, six\r\ndozen candlesticks, one dozen large cups, one large stand (or _nef_),\r\nsix dozen dishes without borders, twelve dozen jars, &c.\r\n\r\nWe have alluded to Venice and the celebrity she attained in the art of\r\nworking glass. It was especially for the manufacture of mirrors and\r\nlooking-glasses that this large and industrious city made herself\r\nrenowned over all the world. If we are to believe Pliny, the Romans\r\npurchased their glass mirrors at Sidon, in Phœnicia, where, in the\r\nremotest ages, they had been invented. At this time were these mirrors\r\nsilvered? We must believe that they were, for a plate of glass, without\r\nquicksilvering, could never be anything than glass more or less\r\ntransparent, and would permit of the light passing through, without\r\nreflecting objects. But Pliny asserts nothing of the kind; and,\r\nmoreover, as the practice of using mirrors of polished metal, which was\r\ntaken from the Romans, was for a long time maintained among modern\r\nnations, we may conclude either that the invention of glass mirrors was\r\nnot a great success, or that the secret of making them was lost. In the\r\nthirteenth century an English monk wrote a treatise on optics, in which\r\nallusion is made to mirrors lined with lead. Nevertheless, mirrors of\r\nsilver continued in use among the rich, and of iron and polished steel\r\nby the poorer classes, till the time when glass became less expensive,\r\nand Venetian looking-glasses were introduced, or cleverly imitated, in\r\nall European countries; metal mirrors, which easily became dim, and did\r\nnot give the natural colour to reflected objects, were then\r\ndiscontinued. At the same time, the elegant shape of the ancient\r\nhand-mirrors was retained, the workers in gold and silver still\r\ncontinuing to encircle them with most graceful designs; the only\r\ndifference being that the surface of polished steel or silver was\r\nreplaced by a thick and bright piece of Venetian glass, sometimes\r\nornamented with reflected designs produced in the coating of quicksilver\r\n(Fig. 18).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Hand or Pocket Mirror in gold or chased silver,\r\nfrom an Engraving by Etienne Delaune, a celebrated French goldsmith and\r\nengraver (Sixteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nFrom all these details, the reader will have the gratification of\r\nascertaining at a glance the general effect of furniture in use for\r\ndomestic purposes; and thus, after the analysis, he will have its\r\nopposite. Fig. 19, a reproduction, taken from the “Dictionnaire du\r\nMobilier Français,” by M. Viollet-le-Duc,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Dwelling room of a Seigneur of the Fourteenth\r\nCentury.]\r\n\r\nrepresents a dwelling-room of a rich nobleman in the fourteenth century.\r\nWhat we now designate as a bedroom, and which was then called simply\r\n_cambre_ or _chambre_, contained, besides the bed--which was very\r\nlarge--a variety of other furniture in use for the ordinary requirements\r\nof daily life; for the time that was not given to business, to out-door\r\namusements, to state receptions, and to meals, was passed, both by\r\nnobles and citizens, in this room. In the fourteenth century\r\nrequirements for comfort had developed themselves in a remarkable degree\r\nin France. To be convinced of this, we have only to glance at the\r\ninventories, to read the romances and narratives of the day, and to\r\nstudy with some little care the mansions and houses erected in the reign\r\nof Charles V. A huge chimney admitted many persons to the fireside. Near\r\nthe hearth was placed the _chaire_ (seat of honour) of the master or of\r\nthe mistress. The bed, which usually stood in a corner, surrounded by\r\nthick curtains, was effectually screened, and formed what was then\r\ncalled a _clotet_; that is, a sort of small room enclosed by tapestry.\r\nNear the windows were _bancals_, or benches with backs covered with\r\ndrapery, on which persons could sit and talk, read, or work, while\r\nenjoying the view. A dresser was ranged along one side of the room, and\r\non its shelves were placed pieces of valuable plate, dishes for comfits,\r\nand flower-vases. Small stools, arm-chairs, and, especially, numerous\r\ncushions were placed here and there in the room. Flemish carpets, and\r\nthose which were called _sarrasinois_, covered the floor; this was\r\ncomposed of enamelled tiles; or, in the northern provinces, of thick\r\nsquares of polished oak. These large, lofty, wainscoted rooms always\r\ncommunicated with private staircases, through dressing-rooms and\r\nwardrobes in which were located the domestics in immediate attendance.\r\n\r\nLet us now pass from domestic furniture to that used for ecclesiastical\r\npurposes. We now leave the palaces of kings, the mansions of nobles, and\r\nthe dwellings of the rich, and enter the buildings consecrated to\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nWe know that in the early ages of Christianity religious ceremonies were\r\ncharacterised by the greatest simplicity, and that the buildings in\r\nwhich the faithful were wont to assemble were for the most part devoid\r\nof any kind of decoration. By degrees, however, rich display entered\r\ninto churches, and pomp accompanied the exercise of religious worship,\r\nespecially at the period when Constantine the Great put an end to the\r\nera of persecutions and proclaimed himself the protector of the new\r\nfaith. It is related that among the rich presents which this emperor\r\ndistributed throughout the Christian temples in Rome, were a golden\r\ncross weighing two hundred pounds, patens of the same metal, lamps\r\nrepresenting animals, &c. At a later period, in the seventh century, St.\r\nEloi, who was a celebrated goldsmith before he became Bishop of Noyon,\r\ngave his whole mind and talents to the manufacture of church ornaments.\r\nHe enlisted from among the monks of the various monasteries that were\r\nsubject to his episcopal authority, all those whom he fancied had an\r\naptitude for these works of art; he instructed and directed them\r\nhimself, and made them excellent artists; he transformed entire\r\nmonasteries into gold and silver-smiths’ workshops; and numerous\r\nremarkable works increased the splendour of the Merovingian basilicas;\r\nsuch, for example, were the shrine of St. Martin of Tours, and the tomb\r\nof St. Denis, the marble roof of which was profusely ornamented with\r\ngold and precious stones. “The bounty of Charlemagne,” says M. Charles\r\nLouandre, “added new riches to the immense wealth already accumulated in\r\nthe churches. Mosaics, sculpture, the rarest kinds of marble, were\r\nlavished on those basilicas for which the emperor evinced partiality;\r\nbut all these treasures were dispersed by the Norman invasions. From the\r\nninth to the eleventh centuries it would seem that, with the exception\r\nof a few shrines and crosses, objects employed for ecclesiastical\r\npurposes were not enriched by the addition of anything note-worthy; at\r\nany rate, the works of that period and those of anterior date have not\r\nbeen handed down to us, if we except some rare fragments. The reason is,\r\nthat, independently of the constant causes of destruction, the furniture\r\nof churches was renewed towards the end of the eleventh century, when\r\nthe edifices themselves were rebuilt; and it is only from the date of\r\nthis mystical Renaissance that we begin to find in the texts precise\r\nindications, and in museums or temples perfectly preserved monuments.”\r\n\r\nEcclesiastical appendages include altars, altar-screens, the pulpit,\r\nmonstrances, chalices, incense-burners, candlesticks or lamps, shrines,\r\nreliquaries, basins for containing holy water, and some other objects of\r\nlesser relative importance, as crosses, bells, and banner-poles. To\r\nthese we may add votive offerings, which were generally either of gold\r\nor silver.\r\n\r\nIn the infancy of religious worship the altar took two distinct shapes;\r\nsometimes the form of a table, with a top of stone, wood, or metal\r\nsupported by legs or by columns; sometimes it resembled an ancient\r\ntomb, or a long coffer, narrowed at the base, and surmounted by a\r\nsimilar covering, which invariably formed the upper portion, or the\r\ntable, of the altar.\r\n\r\nIn addition to altars, more or less monumental, which were fixtures in\r\nthe churches, and which, from the earliest period, were placed under\r\n_ciboria_ (a kind of dais or canopy supported by columns), small\r\nportable altars were employed, in order to meet the requirements of the\r\nservice. They were intended to accompany the bishops, or the ordinary\r\nclergy, who had to preach the faith in countries where no churches\r\nexisted. These altars, which were alluded to when the Christian religion\r\nhad made but slight progress, were no longer seen after it became\r\ngeneral; but we again find them at the time of the Crusades, when pious\r\npilgrims, who journeyed from place to place preaching the Gospel, were\r\nobliged to say mass in fields and public places, where the faithful\r\nassembled to hear them, and to “take up the cross.” M. Jules Labarte\r\ngives the following summary description of a portable altar of the\r\ntwelfth century:--“It consists of a slab of lumachella marble, set in a\r\nbox of gilt copper, 36 centimètres in height by 27 in width, and 3 in\r\nthickness. The top of the box is cut in such a manner as to leave\r\nuncovered the stone on which the chalice was placed during the\r\ncelebration of mass.”\r\n\r\nThroughout all the periods of the Middle Ages, the ardent faith of which\r\nseemed to consider sufficient honour could never be rendered to the real\r\npresence of God in the holy sacrifice, the ornamentation of the altar\r\nwas everywhere looked upon as an object of the most extraordinary pomp\r\nand of the most elevated artistic taste. Among the marvels of this kind\r\nwe must name, as occupying a leading place, the gold altar of St.\r\nAmbrose, in Milan, which dates from 835, and those of the cathedrals of\r\nBasle and Pistoia, which belong to the eleventh and twelfth centuries.\r\nThese gold altars, wrought with the hammer, were chased and sometimes\r\nenamelled, and in addition to remarkably well executed designs in carved\r\nwork, taken from religious books, they usually also had on them\r\nportraits of the donors.\r\n\r\nThe altars and tabernacles were executed with an equal amount of art and\r\ncostliness; and from the earliest period of the fabrication or the\r\nimportation of carpets, embroideries, and gold and silver fabrics, we\r\nsee them employed for the purpose of covering, adorning, and of\r\nrendering more striking and imposing the altar and its accessories, to\r\nwhich the name of chancel was given (Fig. 20).\r\n\r\nThe chalice and the altar-vessels, which date from the very cradle of\r\nChristian worship, since without these sacred vases the fundamental\r\nservices of the religion of Jesus Christ could not have been performed,\r\nperhaps owe it to this exceptional fact that they are not spoken of\r\nbefore the eleventh century (Fig. 21). In truth, nowhere do we find an\r\nindication of their ordinary shape, nor of the mode of their manufacture\r\nin early times; but it is reasonable to suppose that the chalice\r\noriginally was identical, as it was in times approaching nearer to our\r\nown, with the goblet of the ancients; or perhaps, to define it more\r\nparticularly, was the well-known _hanap_ (drinking-cup), the earliest\r\ntype of which tradition endeavours to trace to so early a date. At a\r\nlater period, and until the time when the artists of the Renaissance\r\nperiod were called upon to remodel sacred ornaments, and they\r\ntransformed them into marvels of art on which were lavished all the\r\nresources of casting, chasing, and glyptic, we observe that chalices\r\ncontinued to be manufactured with the greatest care, adorned with\r\nexquisite elegance, and enriched with all the brilliancy that art can\r\ngive them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--An Altar-cloth embroidered in silver on a black\r\nground, representing the procession of a friar of the Abbey of St.\r\nVictor. Fifteenth Century (copied from the original belonging to N.\r\nAchille Jubinal).]\r\n\r\nAll that can be said regarding the chalice applies equally to the\r\nmonstrances and the pyxes employed to contain and to exhibit the\r\nconsecrated wafers, as also to the censers, which originated in the\r\nJewish form of worship, and which, in accordance with the successive\r\nepochs of Christianity, affected different mystical and symbolic shapes\r\n(Fig. 22). Of these M. Didron gives the following description:--“They\r\nwere first formed of two open-work spheroids, in cast and chased copper,\r\nornamented with figures of animals and inscriptions.” Originally they\r\nwere suspended by three chains, which, according to tradition, signified\r\n“the union of the body, the soul, and the divinity in Christ.” At\r\nanother period the censers represented, in miniature, churches and\r\nchapels with pointed arches. Again, at the Renaissance, they took the\r\nform of that now in use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--An Altar-Tray and Chalice, in enamelled gold,\r\nsupposed to be of the Fourth or Fifth Century, found at Gourdon, near\r\nChalon-sur-Saône, in 1846. (Cabinet des Antiques, Bibl. Imp. de Paris.)]\r\n\r\nFrom the first, the lighting of churches was, to a certain extent,\r\ncarried out on much the same principle as that employed in princely\r\nabodes and important mansions. Fixed or movable lamps were used; also\r\nwax candles in chandeliers, for the ornamentation of which pious donors\r\nand pious artisans, the former paying the latter, vied with each other\r\nin skill and liberality. We may here observe that even in the early days\r\nof Christianity, numerous candlesticks were generally employed both by\r\nday and by night. The candlesticks on the altar represented the apostles\r\nsurrounding Christ; thus their number ought to be twelve. Placed around\r\nthe dead, they signified that the Christian finds light beyond the\r\ngrave. To the faithful they typified the day which shines brightly in\r\ncelestial Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe worship of relics, established in the early days of the Church,\r\nsubsequently led to the introduction of shrines and reliquaries, a kind\r\nof portable tomb which the disciples of the Gospel devoted to the\r\nmemory, and in honour, of martyrs and confessors of the faith. Thus from\r\nthe first, in collecting these holy relics, to which the faithful\r\nattached every kind of miraculous powers, they dedicated what, according\r\nto ecclesiastical writers, had been the temple of the living God, a\r\ngorgeous sanctuary, worthy of so many virtues and miracles. Hence the\r\nintroduction of shrines into churches, and reliquaries into private\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Censer of the Eleventh Century, recalling the\r\nshape of the Temple of Jerusalem, in copper repoussé. (Formerly in Metz\r\nCathedral, now at Trèves.)]\r\n\r\nOwing to the care bestowed on some of these by St. Eloi, from the\r\nseventh century, they had become real marvels of intrinsic richness and\r\nartistic finish. Nevertheless we are unacquainted with the shape which,\r\nin accordance with the Christian liturgy, was originally given to the\r\nshrines and reliquaries, although the Latin word _capsa_, from which the\r\nword _châsse_ (shrine) is derived, conveys the idea of a kind of box or\r\ncoffer. Indeed this shape was retained for a long time by the whole of\r\nChristendom; but the majority of shrines in gold and silver work which\r\ndo not date further back than the eleventh or twelfth century represent\r\ntombs, chapels, and even cathedrals. This symbolic shape continued in\r\nuse to the time of the Renaissance, but with successive modifications\r\nsuggested by the architectural style of each period. We thus see there\r\nwas no precious material or delicate workmanship which was not employed\r\nto contribute in making the shrines and reliquaries more magnificent.\r\nGold, silver, rare marbles, precious stones, were lavished on their\r\nconstruction; the chaser and enameller embellished with figures and\r\nemblems, with incidents taken from Holy Writ and from the lives of\r\nsaints, the shrines in which are deposited their remains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 23 and 24.--Stall and Reading-desk in carved wood,\r\nfrom the Church of Aosta (Fifteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nWe know that in the early days of Christianity the rite of baptism was\r\nperformed by immersion in rivers or in fountains, but at a period nearer\r\nto our own time, basins or vessels of various dimensions were placed in\r\na small detached edifice, by the side of the church; into these the\r\nneophytes were plunged when receiving the first sacrament. These\r\nbaptistries disappeared as soon as the practice of sprinkling holy water\r\non the forehead of the catechumen was definitely substituted for that of\r\nimmersion. Baptismal fonts then became what they now are, that is, a\r\nkind of small erection above the level of the floor--piscinas, shells\r\n(_vasques_), or basins, recalling to our minds, though on a reduced\r\nscale, the primitive baptistries. They were placed inside the church,\r\neither near the entrance, or in one of the side-chapels. At various\r\nperiods they were made of stone, marble, or bronze; and were ornamented\r\nwith subjects relating to the rite of baptism. It was the same with the\r\nholy-water basins, which, according to ancient custom, were placed at\r\nthe entrance to the church, and generally assumed the form of a shell,\r\nor of a large amphora, when not made simply of a hollowed stone to\r\nrecall the ancient baptismal vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Bas-relief in carved wood, representing a\r\nDomestic Scene, from the Stalls called “Miséricordes,” in the Choir of\r\nthe Cathedral of Rouen (Fifteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nWe must not overlook the altar and procession-crosses, which, as being\r\ntypical of the divine emblem of the Christian faith, could not fail to\r\nbecome real objects of art even from the time of the catacombs. It would\r\nbe needless repetition to enumerate here the different materials used in\r\nthe manufacture of crosses, the various shapes that were given to them,\r\naccording to the purpose for which they were intended, and the subjects\r\nand figures they represented. The sculptor, the modeller, the chaser,\r\nthe enameller, and even the painter, were associated with the goldsmith\r\nin producing most exquisite works of this kind. The art of the\r\nwood-carver and that of the worker in iron, which we have seen executing\r\nsuch marvels for household furniture, could not fail to find scope in\r\nthe manufacture of objects used for religious purposes. It was\r\nespecially in making pulpits, ornamental screens, wainscoting, and\r\nstalls, that the art of the wood-carver became renowned; he was no\r\nlonger simply an artisan, but became an artist of the highest order. In\r\nthe ornamentation of railings of choirs and tombs, the iron-work on\r\ndoors, of bolts, locks, and keys, the remarkable talent of the\r\nlocksmiths of the Middle Ages was displayed. Let us here remark, that in\r\nthe early days of worship the pulpit was simply a kind of stool on which\r\nthe preacher stood in order that his congregation might see him. By\r\ndegrees the pulpit was raised on supports or columns; and later again,\r\nbut only towards the end of the fifteenth century, we find it fixed at a\r\ngreat height against one of the central pillars of the church, and\r\nusually magnificently carved, as was also the dais, and the\r\nsounding-board by which it was surmounted.\r\n\r\nTo form an idea of the degree of perfection attained in wood-carving\r\nfrom the thirteenth to the fourteenth century, we ought to inspect the\r\nstalls of St. Justine, at Padua, those of the cathedrals of Milan and\r\nUlm, the church of Aosta (Figs. 23 and 24), &c., and the stalls of the\r\nchurches of Rodez, Albi, Amiens, Toulouse, and Rouen (Fig. 25). And if\r\nwe would examine a very ancient example of the art attained by workers\r\nin iron, we have but to notice the hinges, dating from the thirteenth\r\ncentury, which stretch, in arabesque designs, over the panels of the\r\nwestern door of Notre-Dame, Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Design on the Stalls in the Church of St.\r\nBenoît-sur-Loire.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAPESTRY.\r\n\r\n     Scriptural Origin of Tapestry.--Needlework Embroidery in Ancient\r\n     Greek and Roman Times.--Altalic Carpets.--Manufacture of Carpets in\r\n     Cloisters.--Manufactory at Poitiers in the Twelfth Century.--Bayeux\r\n     Tapestry, named “De la Reine Mathilde.”--Arras Carpets.--Inventory\r\n     of the Tapestries of Charles V.; enormous Value of these\r\n     Embroidered Hangings.--Manufactory at Fontainebleau, under Francis\r\n     I.--The Manufacture of the Hôpital de la Trinité, at Paris.--The\r\n     Tapestry Workers, Dubourg and Laurent, in the reign of Henry\r\n     IV.--Factories of Savonnerie and Gobelins.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is an art which bears brilliant testimony to the industry and\r\ningenuity of mankind in the remotest ages, undoubtedly it is that of\r\nweaving, or of embroidering tapestry; for, however far back we trace the\r\nannals of nations, we find this art flourishing and producing marvels of\r\nworkmanship.\r\n\r\nLet us first open the Bible, the oldest of all historical documents; we\r\nread therein of woven fabrics, not only worked on the loom, but also\r\nmade by hand, that is, richly embroidered in needlework on linen or\r\ncanvas. These magnificent fabrics, which were laboriously and minutely\r\nexecuted, represented all kinds of designs in relief and in colours;\r\nthey were used as decorations for the holy temple, and as ornamental\r\ngarments for the priests who performed the religious ceremonies.\r\nIndubitable proof of this is the description, in the book of Exodus, of\r\nthe curtains surrounding the tabernacle. Some of these embroideries, in\r\nthe manufacture of which gold and silver thread, combined with dyed\r\nwools and silk, was used, were named _opus plumarii_ (work in imitation\r\nof bird’s plumage); others--such, for example, as the veil of the Holy\r\nof Holies, which represented cherubim in the act of adoration--were\r\ncalled _opus artificis_ (work of the artisan), because they were made by\r\nthe weaver on the loom; and, with the aid of numerous shuttles, the woof\r\nof wools and silks of various hues was introduced.\r\n\r\nIn the traditions of the magnificent city of Babylon we also find\r\nfigured tapestry delineating the mysteries of religion, and handing\r\ndown to us the recollection of historical incidents. “The palace of the\r\nkings of Babylon,” says Philostratus, in the “Life of Apollonius of\r\nTyana,” “was ornamented with tapestries in gold and silver tissues,\r\nwhich recorded the Grecian fables of Andromeda, of Orpheus, &c.” The\r\nGreek poet Apollonius of Rhodes, who wrote a century before our era,\r\nrelates in his poem of “The Argonauts” that the women of Babylon\r\nexcelled in the execution of these gorgeous textures. The famous\r\ntapestries which were sold in the time of Metellus Scipio for 800,000\r\nsesterces (about 165,000 francs), and a hundred years later were\r\npurchased for the exorbitant sum of two million sesterces (about 412,000\r\nfrancs) by Nero, to place on his festive couches, were of Babylonian\r\nworkmanship.\r\n\r\nAncient Egypt, which would seem to have been the early cradle of an\r\nadvanced civilisation, was also renowned for this marvellous art, the\r\ninvention of which the Greeks attributed to Minerva, and to which\r\nallusion is frequently made in their mythology. Penelope’s web, whereon\r\nwere delineated the exploits of Ulysses, has remained the most\r\ncelebrated among them all. It was on a similar web that Philomela, in\r\nher prison, illustrated in embroidery the narrative of her misfortunes,\r\nafter Tereus had cut out her tongue, to prevent her telling her sister\r\nProgne the outrage she had suffered at his hands.\r\n\r\nThroughout the poems of Homer we find embroidery of this kind either\r\nmentioned, or described as made with the needle or loom, and intended\r\nfor decorative drapery, or as garments for men and women. During the\r\nsiege of Troy, Helen embroidered, upon a fine tissue, the sanguinary\r\ncombats of the heroes who were destroying each other for her sake. The\r\ncloak of Ulysses represents a dog pulling down a fawn, &c.\r\n\r\nThe custom of embroidering such scenes as combats and hunting-incidents\r\nseems to have lasted during a long time. According to Herodotus, certain\r\nraces bordering on the Caspian Sea were accustomed to have figures of\r\nanimals, flowers, and landscapes delineated on their garments. This\r\ncustom is mentioned among the pagans by Philostratus, and among\r\nChristians by Clement of Alexandria. Pliny, the naturalist, who lived in\r\nthe first century of our era, also alludes to it on several occasions in\r\nhis works. Three hundred years later, Amasius, Bishop of Amasia,\r\ndeplores the folly which “set a great value on this art of weaving, a\r\nvain and useless art, which by the combination of the warp and woof\r\nimitates painting.” “When persons thus dressed appear in the street,”\r\nadds the pious bishop, “the passers-by look at them as walking pictures,\r\nand the children point at them with their finger. We see lions,\r\npanthers, bears, rocks, woods, hunters; the religiously inclined have\r\nChrist, his disciples, and his miracles figured on their garments. Here\r\nwe see the wedding of Cana, and the pitchers of water turned into wine;\r\nthere we have the paralytic carrying his bed, or the sinner at the feet\r\nof Jesus, or Lazarus being raised from the dead.”\r\n\r\nWe have only to look into the works of the writers of the time of\r\nAugustus to learn that the halls in the houses of the wealthy were\r\nalways hung with tapestry; and that the tables, or rather the beds, upon\r\nwhich the guests were seated, were covered with carpets.\r\n\r\nThe Attalian carpets, which were thus named because they came from the\r\ninheritance bequeathed to the Roman people by Attalus, King of Pergamos,\r\nwere indescribably magnificent. Cicero, who was a connoisseur in such\r\nmatters, speaks of them with enthusiasm in his works.\r\n\r\nUnder Theodosius I., that is to say, at the time of the decline of the\r\ngreat empire which was soon to break up and be separated, and at last to\r\nmerge into new nationalities, a contemporaneous historian shows us “the\r\nyouth of Rome engaged in making tapestry-work.”\r\n\r\nIn the early period of French history, this ingenious and delicate work\r\nwould seem to have been mainly carried on by women, and especially by\r\nthose of the highest rank. At any rate it is a fact that rich tapestries\r\nwere in common use, both in private houses and for ecclesiastical\r\npurposes, as early as the sixth century; for Gregory of Tours does not\r\nfail to tell us of the embroidered hangings, and also of the tapestry,\r\nin most of the ceremonies which he describes. When King Clovis renounced\r\npaganism and asked to be baptised, “this intelligence was the greatest\r\njoy to the bishop; he orders the sacred fonts to be prepared; the\r\nstreets overhung with painted cloths; the churches ornamented with\r\nhangings.” When the abbey-church of St. Denis had to be consecrated,\r\n“its walls are covered with tapestry embroidered in gold and ornamented\r\nwith pearls.” These tapestries were for a long time preserved in the\r\nabbey-treasury. Subsequently, this same treasury received, as a present\r\nfrom Queen Adelaide, the wife of Hugh Capet, “a chasuble, a valance, as\r\nalso some hangings, worked by her own hand;” and Doublet, the historian\r\nof this ancient abbey, states that Queen Bertha (the same whom the old\r\nFrench proverb makes an indefatigable worker with her needle)\r\nembroidered on canvas a series of historical subjects, depicting the\r\nglorious deeds of the family.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is no written authority for asserting that in France\r\nthe manufacture of tapestries and hangings worked on the loom can be\r\ntraced beyond the ninth century; but at this period, and a little later,\r\nwe find some documents which are as precise as they are curious--proving\r\nthat this industry, the principal object of which, at that period, was\r\nthe ornamentation of churches, had to a certain extent obtained a\r\nfooting, and was flourishing in religious establishments. The ancient\r\nchronicles of Auxerre relate that St. Anthelm, the bishop of that city,\r\nwho died in 828, caused to be made, under his own directions, numerous\r\nrich carpets for the choir of his church.\r\n\r\nOne hundred years later we find a regular manufactory established at the\r\nmonastery of St. Florent, at Saumur. “In the time of the abbot Robert\r\nIII.,” says the historian of this monastery, “the vestry (_fabrique_) of\r\nthe cloister was further enriched by magnificent paintings and pieces of\r\nsculpture, accompanied by legends in verse. The above-mentioned abbot,\r\nwho was passionately devoted to similar works, sought for and purchased\r\na considerable quantity of magnificent ornaments, such as large\r\n_dorserets_[1] in wool, curtains, canopies, hangings, bench-covers, and\r\nother ornaments, embroidered with various devices. Among other objects,\r\nhe caused to be made two pieces of tapestry of large size and of\r\nadmirable quality, representing elephants; and these two pieces were\r\njoined together with a rare kind of silk, by hired workers in tapestry.\r\nHe also ordered two _dorserets_ in wool to be manufactured. It happened\r\nthat, during the time one of these was being completed, the\r\nabove-mentioned abbot went to France. The ecclesiastic left in charge\r\ntook advantage of his absence to forbid the artisans to work the woof\r\naccording to the customary method. ‘Well,’ said they, ‘in the absence of\r\nour good abbot we will not discontinue our employment; but as you thwart\r\nus we shall make quite a different kind of fabric.’ And this now admits\r\nof proof. They made several square carpets, representing silver lions\r\nupon a field of _gules_ (red), with a white border covered with scarlet\r\nanimals and birds. This unique piece of workmanship was looked upon as a\r\nperfect specimen of this kind of fabric, until the time of the abbot\r\nWilliam, when it was considered the most remarkable piece of tapestry\r\nbelonging to the monastery. In fact, on the occasions of great\r\nsolemnities the abbot had the elephant tapestry displayed, and one of\r\nthe priors showed that on which were the lions.”\r\n\r\nFrom the ninth or tenth century there was also a manufactory at\r\nPoitiers; and its fabrics, on which figured kings, emperors, and saints,\r\nwere of European celebrity, as appears to be attested, among other\r\ndocuments, by a remarkable correspondence which took place, in 1025,\r\nbetween an Italian bishop, named Léon, and William IV., Count of Poitou.\r\nTo understand rightly this correspondence, it must be borne in mind that\r\nat the time Poitou was as famous for its mules as for tapestry. In one\r\nof his letters, the bishop begs the count to send him a mule and a piece\r\nof tapestry, both equally marvellous (_mirabiles_), and for which he has\r\nbeen asking six years. He promises to pay whatever they may cost. The\r\ncount, who must have had a facetious disposition, replied, “I cannot, at\r\npresent, send you what you ask, because for a mule to merit the epithet\r\nof marvellous, he would require to have horns, and three tails, or five\r\nlegs--and this I should not be able to find in our country. I shall\r\ntherefore content myself with sending you one of the best I can procure.\r\nAs to the tapestry, I have forgotten the dimensions you desire. Let me\r\nhave these particulars again, and it will then soon be sent to you.”\r\n\r\nBut this costly industry was not limited to the French provinces. In the\r\n“Chronique des Ducs de Normandie,” written by Dudon, in the eleventh\r\ncentury, it is stated that the English were clever workers in this art;\r\nand when designating some magnificent embroidery, or rich tapestry, it\r\nwas described as of English work (_opus Anglicanum_). Moreover, the same\r\nchronicle relates that the wife of Richard I.,[2] the Duchess Gonnor,\r\nassisted by her embroiderers, made hangings of linen and of silk,\r\nembellished with images and figures representing the Virgin Mary and the\r\nSaints, to decorate the church of Notre Dame, Rouen.\r\n\r\nThe East, also, which from the earliest times had been renowned for the\r\nart of producing beautiful embroidered fabrics, became still more famous\r\nduring the Middle Ages for those of wool and silk, embroidered with\r\nsilver and gold. It was from the East were brought the rich stuffs\r\ncovered all over with emblazonments, and with figures of animals, and\r\nprobably also embroidered in open-work: these fabrics were called\r\n_étoffes sculptées_, or _pleines d’yeux_.\r\n\r\nThe librarian Anastasius, in his book the “Lives of the Popes,” which\r\nundoubtedly was written before the eleventh century, gives, when\r\ndescribing church decorations, some curious and circumstantial details\r\nregarding the subject we are now discussing. According to him, as early\r\nas the time of Charlemagne (eighth century), Pope Leo III. “had a veil\r\nmade of purple worked in gold, on which was the history of the Nativity\r\nand of Simon, having in the centre the Annunciation of the Virgin.” This\r\nwas to ornament the principal altar of the Holy Mother of God, at Rome.\r\nHe also ordered for the altar of the church of St. Laurence, “a veil of\r\nsilk worked in gold, having on it the histories of the Passion of our\r\nSaviour and of the Resurrection.” He placed on the altar of St. Peter’s\r\n“a veil of purple of a remarkable size, worked in gold and ornamented\r\nwith precious stones; on one side was seen our Saviour giving St. Peter\r\nthe power to bind and to loose, on the other the Passion of St. Peter\r\nand St. Paul.” In the same book, several other pieces of tapestry are\r\ndescribed in such terms that it seems difficult to realise the richness\r\nand the beauty of finish of these artistically-worked fabrics, which for\r\nthe most part came from Asia or Egypt. It was only in the twelfth\r\ncentury, after the return from the first crusades had enabled Western\r\nnations to admire and to appropriate to themselves luxuries quite new to\r\nthem, that the custom of using tapestry, while becoming far more general\r\nin churches, found its way also into private dwellings. If, in the\r\ncloisters, the monks, in order to find employment, lavished their utmost\r\ncare on the weaving of wool and of silk, there was the more reason why\r\nthis occupation should prove pleasing to the noble _châtelaines_ who\r\nwere confined to their feudal castles. It was then, when surrounded by\r\ntheir tire-women, as in earlier times were the Roman matrons by their\r\nslaves, that these fair dames, while listening to the reading of tales\r\nof chivalry which deeply interested them, or inspired by a profound\r\nfaith, gave themselves to the task of reproducing with the needle either\r\nthe pious legends of the saints or the glorious exploits of warriors.\r\nThe bare walls, when thus draped with touching incidents or warlike\r\nmemorials, assumed a peculiar eloquence which doubtless inspired the\r\nmind with grand visions, and aroused noble sentiments in the heart.\r\n\r\nAmong the finest specimens of this kind is one which, owing to its\r\nreally exquisite character, has escaped what would have seemed\r\ninevitable destruction. We allude to the famous Bayeux tapestry called\r\n“_de la Reine Mathilde_” (of the wife of William the Conqueror). This\r\nwork represents the conquest of England by the Normans. If we are to\r\naccept the ancient traditions to which it owes its name, it must date\r\nfrom the last half of the eleventh century.\r\n\r\nIn these days we may be permitted to doubt, in consequence of the many\r\ndiscussions that have taken place among the learned, if this embroidery\r\nis as ancient as was at one time supposed. And although we first find it\r\nalluded to in an inventory (prepared in 1476) of the treasury of Bayeux\r\nCathedral, we may venture, with a certain degree of confidence, to\r\nbelieve that it was made in the twelfth century by Englishwomen, who at\r\nthat time were particularly famous for their needlework; an opinion\r\nconfirmed by more than one author contemporaneous with William and\r\nMatilda.\r\n\r\nThis tapestry, which is 19 inches in height, by nearly 212 feet in\r\nlength, is a piece of brown linen, on which are embroidered with the\r\nneedle, in wool of different colours (and these seem to have lost none\r\nof their early freshness), a series of seventy-two groups or subjects,\r\nwith legends in Latin interspersed with Saxon, embracing the whole\r\nhistory of the Conquest, as related by the chroniclers of the period\r\n(Figs. 27 and 28).\r\n\r\nAt the first glance, this embroidery may seem to be but a rudely\r\nexecuted grouping of figures and animals; nevertheless there is\r\ncharacter throughout, and the original outline, discoverable beneath the\r\nintersections of the wool, is not wanting in a certain accuracy that\r\nbrings to our mind the vigorous simplicity of the Byzantine style. The\r\ndecoration of the double border, between which is delineated a drama\r\nwherein 530 figures are introduced, is the same as those of the\r\npaintings in manuscripts of the Middle Ages. And, in short, failing any\r\nexact proof, if we are determined not to deprive this immense work of\r\nits traditional antiquity, it might, with much probability, be\r\nattributed to a female embroiderer of Queen Matilda, named Leviet, whose\r\nskill has rescued her name from oblivion. It may also be well to observe\r\nthat at the time it is first alluded to in history, this tapestry is\r\nfound belonging to the very church in which Matilda desired to be\r\nburied.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen (in the chapter on Furniture) that towards the\r\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries, under the influence of Eastern habits\r\nand\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--A piece of the Bayeux Tapestry, representing\r\nthe construction of Boats for William (with Border).]\r\n\r\ncustoms, the practice of sitting on carpets was established at the court\r\nof our kings. From this date rich tapestries were frequently used for\r\nmaking tents for campaigning or for hunting. They were displayed on\r\nfestive occasions; as, for instance, when princes were entering a town,\r\nthe object being to hide the bare walls. The dining-halls were hung with\r\nmagnificent tapestries, giving additional splendour to the interludes\r\n(_entremets_, or _intermèdes_) performed during the repast. The\r\nchampions in the lists saw glittering around them, suspended from the\r\ngalleries, fabrics on which heroic deeds were embroidered. Lastly, the\r\ncaparison of the charger (the war-horse’s garb of honour) displayed its\r\nbrilliant emblazonings to the eyes of admiring crowds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--A portion of the Bayeux Tapestry, representing\r\ntwo mounted men of Duke William’s army armed from head to foot, and in\r\nthe act of fighting.]\r\n\r\nIt was moreover the custom that the tapestries made for noblemen should\r\nbear their respective armorial devices, the object being, no doubt, that\r\nit might be known to whom they belonged when used on the occasion of the\r\nentry of royal and other distinguished personages in solemn processions;\r\nand also at jousts and tournaments.\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century the manufactories of Flanders, which were of\r\nconsiderable reputation even about the twelfth century, made great\r\nadvance, and the success of the Arras tapestries became so general that\r\nthe most handsome hangings were called Arras tapestry, although the\r\ngreater part of them did not come from that city. It may here be noticed\r\nthat the term _Arrazi_ is, in Italy, still synonymous with valuable\r\ntapestry (Fig. 29).\r\n\r\nThese fabrics were generally worked in wool, and sometimes in flax and\r\nlinen: but at the same period Florence and Venice, which had imported\r\nthis industry from the East, wove tapestries wherein gold and silk were\r\nblended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Marriage of Louis XII. and Anne of Brittany.\r\nTapestry in wool and silk, with a mixture of gold and silver thread.\r\nMade in Flanders the end of the Fifteenth Century. (Lent by M. Achille\r\nJubinal.)]\r\n\r\nAn inventory, dated 21st January, 1379, contained in a manuscript now in\r\nthe “Bibliothèque Impériale,”--in which are enumerated “all the jewels\r\nin gold and silver, all the rooms with embroidery and tapestries\r\nbelonging to Charles V.,”--gives us an idea not only of the multiplicity\r\nof hangings and tapestries that appertained to the personal property of\r\nroyalty, especially at the Hôtel Saint-Pol, but it also shows us the\r\nvariety\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n\r\nTapestry of Berne of the fifteenth Century\r\n\r\n(Communicated by M. Achille Jubinal.)]\r\n\r\nof subjects therein represented. A few of these pieces of tapestry are\r\nstill preserved, but among some which have been destroyed or lost we may\r\nmention those representing the Passion of our Saviour, the Life of St.\r\nDenis, the Life of St. Theseus, and that entitled Goodness and\r\nBeauty--all these were of large dimensions. Then again, the tapestry of\r\nthe Seven Mortal Sins, two pieces of the Nine Bold Knights, that of the\r\nladies hunting and flying (_qui volent_), in other words, hawking; that\r\nof the Wild Men; two of Godfrey de Bouillon; a white tapestry for a\r\nchapel, in the centre of which was seen “a compass with a rose,”\r\nemblazoned with the arms of France and of Dauphiny, this was three yards\r\nsquare; one large handsome piece of tapestry, “the king has bought,\r\nwhich is worked with gold, representing the Seven Sciences and St.\r\nAugustin;” the tapestry of Judith (the queen who subsequently appears on\r\nplaying-cards); a large piece of Arras cloth, representing the Battles\r\nof Judas Maccabæeus and Antiochus; another of “the Battle of the Duke of\r\nAquitaine and of Florence;” a piece of tapestry “whereon are worked the\r\ntwelve months of the year;” another of “the Fountain of Jouvent”\r\n(Jouvence), a large piece of tapestry “covered with azure fleurs-de-lys,\r\nwhich said fleurs-de-lys are mingled with other small yellow\r\nfleurs-de-lys, having in the centre a lion, and, at the four corners,\r\nbeasts holding banners, &c.”--in fact, the list is endless. We must\r\nstill, however, add to these figured tapestries those with armorial\r\nbearings, made for the most part with “Arras thread,” and bearing the\r\narms of France and Behaigne (the latter being those of the queen,\r\ndaughter of the King of Bohemia). There was also a piece of tapestry\r\n“worked with towers, fallow bucks and does, to put over the king’s\r\nboat.” The tapestry called _velus_, or velvet, which now we call\r\n_moquettes_, was as commonly seen as any other kind. There were also to\r\nbe noticed the _Salles d’Angleterre_, or the tapestries from that\r\ncountry, which, as we have said, had previously acquired a great\r\ncelebrity in that art. Among these one was “_ynde_ (blue), with trees\r\nand wild men, with wild animals, and castles;” others were vermilion,\r\nembroidered with azure, having vignette borders, and in the centre\r\nlions, eagles, and leopards.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, Charles V. possessed at his castle of Melun many\r\n“silken fabrics and tapestries.” At the Louvre one could but admire,\r\namong other magnificent pieces of tapestry, “a very lovely green room,\r\nornamented with silk covered with leaves; and representing in the centre\r\na lion, which two queens were in the act of crowning, and a fountain\r\nwherein swans were disporting themselves.”\r\n\r\nYet we must not be led away with the idea that it was only the royal\r\npalaces which presented such sumptuousness; for it would be easy to\r\nenumerate many instances similar to those we have given, by looking over\r\nthe inventories of the personal property of nobles, or those of the\r\ntreasuries of certain churches and abbeys. In one place the tapestries\r\nrepresent religious subjects taken from the Bible, the Gospels, or the\r\nlegends of the saints; in another the subjects are either historical or\r\nrelating to chivalry, more especially battles or hunting scenes (Fig.\r\n30).\r\n\r\nWe are thus justified in asserting that the luxury of tapestry was\r\ngeneral among the higher classes. An expensive taste it was; because not\r\nonly does an examination of these marvellous works show us that they\r\ncould have been purchased only at a very high price, but in old\r\ndocuments we find more than one certain confirmation of this fact. For\r\nexample, Amaury de Goire, a worker in tapestry, received in 1348, from\r\nthe Duke of Normandy and Guienne, 492 livres, 3 sous, 9 deniers, for “a\r\nwoollen cloth,” on which were represented scenes from the Old and New\r\nTestaments. In 1368, Huchon Barthélmy, money-changer, received 900\r\ngolden francs for a piece of “worked tapestry, representing La Quête de\r\nSt. Graal (the search for the blood of Christ); and in 1391, the\r\ntapestry exhibiting the history of Theseus, to which we have already\r\nalluded, was purchased by Charles V. for 1,200 livres; all these sums,\r\nconsidering the period, were really exorbitant.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth century, remarkable for the progress and the excellence to\r\nwhich the arts of every kind had attained, gave a renewed impulse to\r\nthat of tapestry. A manufactory was established by Francis I., at\r\nFontainebleau, where the tapestry was woven in one entire piece, instead\r\nof being made up, as had been the practice, of separate pieces matched\r\nand sewn together. In this new fabric gold and silver threads were mixed\r\nwith silk and wool.\r\n\r\nWhen Francis sent for the Primate from Italy, he commissioned him to\r\nprocure designs for several pieces of tapestry, to be made in the\r\nworkshops of Fontainebleau. But, while liberally rewarding the Italian\r\nor Flemish artists and artisans collected in the dependencies of his\r\nchâteau, the king still continued to employ Parisian tapestry-workers;\r\nproof of which is to be found in a receipt of the sieurs Miolard and\r\nPasquier, who give an\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Tapestry representing a Hunting Scene, from the\r\nChâteau d’Effiat. (In the possession of M. Achille Jubinal.)]\r\n\r\nacknowledgment of having been paid 410 _livres tournois_, “to begin the\r\npurchase of materials and other requisites for a piece of silk tapestry,\r\nwhich the said seigneur had ordered them to make for his coronation,\r\naccording to the patterns which the said seigneur has had prepared for\r\nthis purpose, and on which must be represented a Leda, with certain\r\nnymphs, satyrs, &c.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--The Weaver. Drawn and Engraved by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nHenry II. did even more than maintain the establishment at\r\nFontainebleau; in addition he instituted, in compliance with the request\r\nof the guardians of the Hôpital de la Trinité, a manufactory of tapestry\r\nin Paris, in which the children belonging to the hospital were employed\r\nin dyeing wool and silk, and in weaving them in the loom with a high and\r\nlow warp.\r\n\r\nThe new manufactory, whether on account of the excellence of its\r\nproductions, or from influential patronage, obtained so many privileges\r\nthat the public peace was on several occasions seriously disturbed by\r\nthe jealousy of the guild of tapestry-workers; an ancient and numerous\r\ncorporation still possessing great authority and influence.\r\n\r\nThe manufactory of the Hôpital de la Trinité continued to flourish\r\nduring the reign of Henry III.; and Sauval, in his “Histoire des\r\nAntiquités de\r\n\r\n     PLAN OF PARIS IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY,\r\n\r\n     WITH THIS LEGEND:\r\n\r\n    _Mil cinq cents ans quarante et neuf passez_\r\n    _Du déluge: Paris le noble roy_\r\n    _Dix-huitième: fonda en grand arroy_\r\n    _Ville et cité de Paris belle assez_\r\n    _Devant que Rome eust des gens amassez_\r\n    _Six cent cinquante et huit ans comme croy._\r\n\r\n     TRANSLATION.\r\n\r\n     One thousand five hundred and forty-nine years after the Deluge,\r\n     the noble King Paris, the eighteenth of his name, founded with\r\n     great pomp the fine town and city of Paris, anterior to the\r\n     foundation of Rome, which took place, as I think, 658 (?) years\r\n     before Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF PARIS IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nBeauvais Tapestry (Communicated by M. Achille Jubinal.)]\r\n\r\nParis,” informs us that in the following reign it reached its highest\r\npoint of prosperity. In 1594, Dubourg made in these workshops, from the\r\ndesigns of Lerembert, the beautiful tapestries which, to a date very\r\nnear our own, decorated the Church of Saint-Merry. Henry IV., says\r\nSauval, hearing this work much spoken of, desired to see it, and was so\r\npleased therewith that he resolved to restore the manufactories in\r\nParis, “which the disorder of preceding reigns had abolished.” He\r\ntherefore established Laurent, a celebrated tapestry-worker, in the\r\n_maison professe_ of the Jesuits, which had remained closed since the\r\ntrial of Jean Chastel. He allowed one crown a day, and one hundred\r\nfrancs a year, as wages to this skilful artist; his apprentices\r\nreceiving ten sous a day, and his fellow-workmen twenty-five, thirty,\r\nand even forty sous, according to their skill. At a later period Dubourg\r\nand Laurent, who had entered into partnership, were both installed in\r\nthe galleries of the Louvre. Henry IV., following the example of Francis\r\nI., brought from Italy skilled workers in gold and in silk. These he\r\nlodged in the Hôtel de la Maque, Rue de la Tisseranderie: the special\r\nworks they made were hangings in fine cloth of gold and silver\r\n(_frisé_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Banner of the Tapestry Workers of Lyons.]\r\n\r\nSubsequently to the sixteenth century, the tapestries fabricated at the\r\nmanufactories of the Savonnerie, the Gobelins, and at Beauvais, &c.,\r\nalthough more perfect as regards the weaving, and therefore presenting\r\ngreater regularity of design and a better comprehension of colour and\r\nperspective, unfortunately lost the original simplicity which\r\ncharacterized them in olden times. Approaching the reign of Louis XIV.,\r\nunder the influence of the school of Le Brun,[3] they affected an\r\nimitation of Greek and Roman forms, which seem out of place in France.\r\nHandsome countenances are the result, out accompanied by meaningless\r\nfigures; the frankness of truth gives place to staid coldness, the ideal\r\nusurps the place of nature, conventionality that of spontaneity. We find\r\nthem ingenious, pretty, and even beautiful productions, but wanting\r\ncharacter, the real soul of works of art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCERAMIC ART.\r\n\r\n     Pottery Workshops in the Gallo-Romano Period.--Ceramic Art\r\n     disappears for several Centuries in Gaul: is again found in the\r\n     Tenth and Eleventh Centuries.--Probable Influence of Arabian Art in\r\n     Spain.--Origin of Majolica.--Luca della Robbia and his\r\n     Successors.--Enamelled Tiles in France, dating from the Twelfth\r\n     Century.--The Italian Manufactories of Faenza, Rimini, Pesaro,\r\n     &c.--Beauvais Pottery.--Invention and Works of Bernard Palissy; his\r\n     History; his _Chefs-d’œuvre_.--The _Faïence_ of Thouars, called\r\n     “Henri II.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can assuredly say, with M. Jacquemart, that “the history of the\r\nceramic art of the Middle Ages is shrouded by a veil which probably will\r\nalways remain impenetrable. Notwithstanding the constant investigations\r\nof local societies, and the numerous documents that have been brought to\r\nlight, nothing has transpired to remove the doubts of the archæologist\r\nregarding the places where the manufacture of pottery had its birth\r\namong us.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is certain that at the Gallo-Romano period--that is to\r\nsay, when the Romans, having made themselves masters of that country,\r\nhad introduced their customs and their industry--Gaul possessed numerous\r\nand considerable pottery workshops, which produced vessels and vases of\r\nall kinds. Maintaining the ancient forms and processes of manufacture,\r\nthese factories continued to furnish, till about the sixth century,\r\namphoræ, basins, cups on stems, dishes, plates, and bottles. They were\r\nmade, with the aid of the potter’s wheel, of grey, yellow, or brown\r\nclay. Some of the finest quality were covered with a brilliant varnish,\r\nresembling red sealing-wax both in colour and appearance; and these\r\narticles were often ornamented with much care and delicacy. We find\r\nvases surrounded with garlands of leaves, cups embellished with figures\r\nof men and animals; these are so many proofs that this was a manufacture\r\nto which the influence of art was by no means unknown.\r\n\r\nYet it is also evident that this industry--one of a sufficiently\r\nelevated kind--nearly disappeared about the period of the invasions and\r\nwars amidst the tumult of which French monarchy had its birth; and\r\nthere remained but the simple art that provided for ordinary\r\nrequirements an assemblage of articles rude and devoid of character.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that the ceramic art which had\r\nflourished in the West merely migrated, instead of becoming extinct; and\r\nit found, like so many other arts, a new country in that Byzantium\r\ndestined to be the sanctuary of ancient magnificence. Whatever may be\r\nthe reason, ceramic art disappeared from the soil of France during a\r\nlong period; and it is still a question what was the real origin of its\r\nrevival. Did it revive of itself, or was it under the influence of\r\nexample? Did it owe its resuscitation to any immigration of artisans, or\r\nto the importation of some process of manufacture? These questions still\r\nremain unanswered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Vases of ancient shape, represented in the\r\ndecorative sculpture of the Church of St. Benoît, Paris. (Twelfth\r\nCentury.)]\r\n\r\nThe ceramic art, which perhaps we somewhat wrongly style modern, is\r\ncharacterized by the use of enamel, or overlaying articles with a glaze\r\nhaving a metallic basis; this the fire of the oven vitrifies; it is a\r\nprocess of which the ancients were entirely ignorant.\r\n\r\nBut, in searching the tombs that belonged to the ancient abbey of\r\nJumièges (in Normandy), and which date from the year 1120, there have\r\nbeen found fragments of pottery of a fine but porous clay, covered with\r\na glazing somewhat similar to that now used.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we read in a chronicle of the ancient province of Alsace, that\r\nin the year 1283 “died a potter of Schelestadt, who was the first to\r\ncover earthen vessels with glass.”\r\n\r\nBut we also know that at the time when these isolated attempts were\r\nbeing carried out in France, the Persians and Armenians had long before\r\ndiscovered the art of making magnificent enamelled ware for covering the\r\nexterior of their monuments; and that the Arabs settled in Spain\r\nproduced wonderful examples of painted and enamelled earthenware, with\r\nwhich they decorated and furnished those palaces whose grand ruins are\r\nstill to us like the fairy visions of a dream or of enchantment. The\r\nvases of the Alhambra, types of an art as original as it was singularly\r\ningenious, claim, and doubtless will always claim, the admiration of\r\nminds that can appreciate the beautiful in whatever form it may present\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Vases of ancient form, represented in the\r\ndecorative sculptures of the Church of St. Benoît, Paris. (Twelfth\r\nCentury.)]\r\n\r\nAnd now, are we to suppose that the intercourse between nations and the\r\ntransactions of commerce must necessarily have made western Europe\r\nacquainted with the enamelled dishes of Asia, or the _chefs-d’œuvre_ of\r\nthe African race in Spain? Or, on the other hand, shall we say that it\r\nwas by a spontaneous effort of invention that our forefathers opened up\r\nthe road to a new domain of art? In the one case we have the opinion,\r\ndeservedly respected, of Scaliger, who affirms the fact, apparently very\r\nsignificant, that during the Middle Ages there existed in the Balearic\r\nIslands manufactories of pottery of Arab origin; our learned author even\r\nadds, that in accordance with the most probable etymology, the name of\r\n_Majolica_, which was first given to Italian ware (the earliest in the\r\nEuropean revival of the ceramic art), was derived from _Majorca_, the\r\nlargest, as we know, of the Balearic Islands, in which locality the\r\nprincipal manufactory of these pottery wares was situated. But, on the\r\nother hand, a comparative examination of Arab and Italian wares excludes\r\nall idea not only of affiliation, but even of imitation or reminiscence\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nIn the face of such contradictory coincidence, if we may say so, it\r\nwould be as difficult as it would be rash to pronounce an opinion; we\r\nconsider it better, while disregarding problematical indications, to\r\nboldly face a train of facts now determined by historical proof.\r\n\r\n“At the commencement of the fifteenth century”--we cannot do better than\r\nborrow from M. Jacquemart a passage which he himself took from the\r\nItalian work by Passeri, on Majolica (Pesaro, 1838, in 8vo.)--“Luca\r\ndella Robbia, the son of Simone di Marro, apprenticed himself to a\r\nFlorentine goldsmith, Leonardo, the son of Giovanni; but disliking the\r\nconfinement of a laboratory, he soon became a pupil of the sculptor\r\nLorenzo Ghiberti, who made the gates of the Baptistry at Florence. His\r\nrapid progress under so able a master placed him in a position, when he\r\ncould not have been more than fifteen years old, to undertake the task\r\nof ornamenting a chapel for Sigismond Malatesta, at Rimini. Two years\r\nlater, Pietro di Medici, who was having an organ erected in Santa-Maria\r\ndei Fiori, at Florence, directed Luca to execute some marble sculptures\r\nin that church. The fame which he gained by these works drew everybody’s\r\nattention to the young sculptor. Orders reached him in such numbers that\r\nhe clearly saw the impossibility of executing them in marble or in\r\nbronze; added to this, he bore with impatience the restraint imposed by\r\nworking with such rigid materials, of which the laborious handling\r\ntrammelled the flights of his imagination. Soft and plastic clay was a\r\nmaterial far better suited to his readiness of conception. At the same\r\ntime, Luca dreamt of the future, and of glory; and thus having in view\r\nthe object of executing works which, though less perishable, might be\r\nrapidly executed, he devoted all his efforts to discover a coating which\r\nwould give to clay the polish and the hardness of marble. After many\r\ntrials, a varnish made of tin (_étain_), which was white, opaque, and of\r\na resisting nature, furnished him with the result he hoped for. The art\r\nof producing fine earthenware was discovered, which first received the\r\nname of vitrified clay (_terra invetriata_).\r\n\r\n“Luca’s enamel was a most perfect white; he first used it alone for\r\nfigures, in semi-relief, which were raised on a blue background. At a\r\nlater period he ventured to colour his figures, and Pietro di Medici\r\nwas one of the first who encouraged this kind of work for the decoration\r\nof palaces. The fame of this novel art spread with rapidity; all the\r\nchurches were anxious to possess some specimen of the master, so that\r\nLuca was soon compelled to associate with himself his two brothers\r\nOttaviano and Agostino, in order to keep pace with the requirements of\r\nthe public. He endeavoured, nevertheless, to extend the application of\r\nhis discovery by painting flowers and groups of figures on a smooth\r\nsurface; but in the year 1430 death cut short his remarkable career, and\r\nstayed, in the hands of the inventor, the progress of _enamelled\r\npottery_ (Fig. 35).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Enamelled Terra-cotta, by Luca della Robbia.]\r\n\r\n“The family of Luca, however, made public the secret of his discovery.\r\nHis two nephews, Luca and Andrea, produced some figures and designs of\r\nsingular merit in terra-cotta. Luca ornamented the floor of the Loggia\r\nof Raphael. Girolumo, a relative of Luca, come to France, where he\r\ndecorated the château of Madrid, in the neighbourhood of Paris. Two\r\nfemales, Lisabetta and Speranza, added to the renown of the family Della\r\nRobbia.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of the revival, or rather of the creation, of\r\nceramic art in Italy, as briefly recorded by a man thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith the subject. An ancient author, and, moreover, a competent writer,\r\ninstances some monuments of an earlier date; among others a tomb at\r\nBologna, in which were tiles covered with a green and yellow varnish,\r\nand vessels (_écuelles_) of the same kind inserted in the façades or\r\nporticoes of the churches of Pesaro and the abbey of Pomposa. But to the\r\nhonour of Luca della Robbia it may be remarked, that these specimens of\r\nan earlier industry differed essentially from his productions; because\r\nthe glazing that covered them, the basis of which was lead, was so\r\ntransparent, that through it could be seen either the clay or the\r\ncolours underneath; whereas the enamel discovered by Luca, the basis of\r\nwhich was tin, had, on the contrary, for its essential character, an\r\nopacity which may be termed intense. Let us observe, moreover, that in\r\norder to embellish his productions with paintings, Luca was accustomed\r\nto apply colours to the first and general coating, which became fixed by\r\na subsequent process of baking.\r\n\r\nIt is by recognising the distinction we have just laid down between\r\nthese two processes, that the productions of Italian ceramic art are\r\nordinarily classified: the _demi-majolica_, with transparent glaze,\r\nsomewhat like the Spanish-Arabian pottery, and also, perhaps, like\r\nAsiatic tiles; then the _majolica_, by which we understand fine\r\nearthenware, where the clay is covered with a coating of opaque varnish,\r\ndistinguishing the invention due to Luca della Robbia.\r\n\r\nHaving given priority of invention to Luca della Robbia, it is as well,\r\nnevertheless, here to state, that from the eleventh and twelfth\r\ncenturies there existed in France a kind of ceramic art employed\r\nespecially in the manufacture of varnished pottery-tiles. Many, of baked\r\nclay, have been found with drawings and designs in black or brown on a\r\nwhite or yellow ground (Plate IV.). At a later period these tiles, of\r\nwhich we see such brilliant specimens in the small pictures in\r\nmanuscripts, especially in those\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAVING TILES OF THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH\r\nCENTURIES.]\r\n\r\nof the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, were embellished with\r\ndesigns, emblems, armorial bearings, and scrolls. As already stated, in\r\nthe passage from the author whom we have taken as our guide, the impulse\r\nwhich Luca della Robbia gave to ceramic art extended itself with\r\nrapidity in every direction; and if any other reason were wanting,\r\nbeyond the intrinsic value of this art, to account for its development,\r\nwe should say that the circumstances in the midst of which Luca made his\r\ndiscovery were eminently favourable to its advancement.\r\n\r\nLuxurious display was, at that time, prominent among the classes who\r\naspired to ostentation. When writing of furniture, we saw to what a\r\npitch of splendid profusion kings, princes, and nobles carried the mania\r\nfor displaying their wealth. We particularly pointed out sideboards in\r\nthe dining-rooms, covered with plate and all kinds of objects, which\r\nwere only placed there to dazzle the eyes. The custom of these displays\r\nhaving been introduced, it could nevertheless be only indulged in by\r\nthose in possession of considerable fortunes, and therefore it will be\r\nreadily understood how quickly fashion affected the productions of\r\nceramic art; which, in addition to being recognised as works of art,\r\nwere singularly well suited, both in character and by their comparative\r\ncheapness, to the spirit of ostentation which had taken possession of\r\npeople of inferior rank. It was sufficient that some piece of majolica\r\nshould have found a place on the sideboard of a prince amidst the gold\r\nand the silver which hitherto had alone enjoyed this privilege, for the\r\nlower ranks of the _bourgeoisie_ and the _tiers-état_ to adopt the\r\nfashion, in their dining-rooms, of decorating them either with majolica\r\nalone, or associated with plate.\r\n\r\nAnd admitting this fact, that the productions of ceramic art were thus\r\nallowed to find admittance, and, as it were, in some measure an equally\r\ndistinguished position, amidst plate and objects of precious metals, it\r\nresulted that this new industry, supported by the best artists, soon\r\nbecame remarkable for works which were at the same time most beautiful\r\nand original.\r\n\r\nAs something new in history, we find simple pieces of pottery--to give\r\nthem their generic name--passing as valuable offerings among the great,\r\nand employed on very many occasions to denote ardent admiration in the\r\nworld of courtly gallantry. It is thus we have handed down to us,\r\nprincipally on cups by renowned masters, portraits of the beauties who\r\nin those times adorned the ranks of the nobility: the Dianas, the\r\nFrancescas, the Lucias, the Proserpines, whom their admirers caused to\r\nbe portrayed in order to offer them their own likenesses.\r\n\r\nIt was at Florence, about the year 1410, that Luca della Robbia first\r\nintroduced his invention; but as soon as the process became known, the\r\ngreater part of the towns of Italy, especially those of Tuscany,\r\nestablished manufactories, among which a remarkable rivalry soon arose:\r\nPesaro, Gubbio, Urbino, Faenza, Rimini, Bologna, Ravenna, Ferrara, Citta\r\nCastellana, Bassano, Venice, emulated each other, and almost all\r\nsucceeded in giving, as it were, an individual character to their\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nPesaro--the place were the earliest workshops of ornamental pottery in\r\nItaly were seated, and the processes of which (derived from Luca della\r\nRobbia) seem to have blended with the ancient Spanish, or\r\n_Majorquaises_--presents to us a design of a rather harsh and stiff\r\ncharacter. “The outlines of figures,” adds M. Jacquemart, “are drawn in\r\nmanganese black, the flesh is the colour of the enamel, and the drapery\r\nalone is of uniform tint.”\r\n\r\nIt was at Pesaro that the celebrated Lanfranco flourished. The ceramic\r\nmuseum of Sèvres has two of his pieces: it was he who invented the\r\nmethod of applying gold to earthenware, at a time when the early\r\nprocesses of ornamenting this manufacture had ceased to be employed, and\r\nhad given place to delicate paintings, which, although no longer\r\nexecuted by the most renowned artists of Italy, were nevertheless the\r\nwork of intelligent pupils who had received the benefit of their\r\nteaching and example.\r\n\r\nThe manufactory at Gubbio had for its founder Giorgio Andreoli, who,\r\nboth as a sculptor and an artist in majolica, executed works as\r\nremarkable in form as in effect. “The palette of mineral colours adopted\r\nby Andreoli was the most perfect of the period; and coppery yellows,\r\nruby reds, are frequently used in his works.” There are still extant\r\nsome works signed by this _master_ (a title officially conferred on him\r\nby a patent of nobility); one is a slab in the Sèvres collection, and\r\nanother a tablet representing the Holy Family.\r\n\r\nUrbino--of which the dukes, especially Guidobaldo II., signalized\r\nthemselves as the most zealous patrons of ceramic art--became famous\r\nthrough the works of Francesco Xanto, who executed historical subjects\r\non enamelled clay. Xanto had as a successor Orazio Fontana, who has been\r\nnamed “the Raphael of Majolica,” and who produced, among other\r\nmagnificent objects, some vases which, when subsequently seen by\r\nChristina of Sweden, so impressed her by their beauty that she offered\r\nto exchange for them silver vases of equal size.\r\n\r\nIt was at the manufactory of Deruta that imaginative subjects on\r\nmajolica were first introduced; Bassano was famous for its landscapes\r\nwith ruins; Venice became celebrated for delicate ware with _repoussé_\r\nreliefs; Faenza is still proud of her Guido Salvaggio; Florence of her\r\nFlaminio Fontana, &c.\r\n\r\nMajolica attained to its highest point of brilliancy under the Duke of\r\nUrbino whom we have already named, Guidobaldo II., who was ever ready to\r\nmake any sacrifice in order that this art might be introduced into the\r\nmanufactories under his patronage. He even obtained from Raphael and\r\nGiulio Romano some original drawings to serve as examples; and this\r\nfeeling having once been inculcated, we soon find artists of renown,\r\nsuch as Batista Franco and Raphael del Colle, tendering their services\r\nfor the ornamentation of majolica. Thus the productions of this period\r\nare distinguishable among all others for harmony of composition and\r\naccurate drawing, qualities which render them specially noteworthy (Fig.\r\n36). Then, almost immediately, followed the decline of this art. While\r\nflourishing more and more until the middle of the sixteenth century, the\r\nart of making majolica had fallen, at the termination of that epoch,\r\ninto a kind of degenerate industry, swayed by the caprice of fashion,\r\nand thereby reduced to mannerism.\r\n\r\nNearly at the commencement of the renovation of ceramic art, Italian\r\nartisans had established themselves in various places, which then became\r\nso many artistic centres. Eastern Europe had for its earliest\r\ninstructors three brothers, Giovanni, Tiseo, and Lazio, who settled at\r\nCorfu. Flanders was indebted for the knowledge of these processes to\r\nGuido of Savino, who took up his abode at Antwerp. And about the year\r\n1520 we find a manufactory at Nuremberg, of which the ware, though\r\nmaterially differing in character from Italian majolica, may still very\r\nprobably have been derived from Italy.\r\n\r\nWe may add that letters of the King of France mention that from 1456\r\nthere were certain revenues derivable from the “Beauvais Potteries;” and\r\nin the twenty-seventh chapter of the first book of “Pantagruel,”\r\npublished in 1535, Rabelais places among the various articles composing\r\nthe trophy of Panurge, “a saucer, a salt-cellar of clay, and a Beauvais\r\ngoblet;” which proves, as M. de Sommerard remarks, “that as early as\r\nthis date, there were manufactured in this city vessels of clay\r\nsufficiently good in quality to be placed on the table with silver and\r\npewter utensils;” but it does not naturally follow that France had not\r\nlong to wait for the man of genius who would soon leave her nothing to\r\ncovet from Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Cup, Italian Ware. In the Collection of Baron\r\nAlph. Rothschild. Taken from MM. Carle Delange and C. Borneman’s work.]\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1510, in a small village in Périgord, a child was born\r\nwho, after receiving the rudiments of education, was obliged while still\r\nquite young to try to gain a livelihood by his own industry. This\r\nchild’s name was Bernard Palissy. He first learnt the trade of a\r\nglazier, or rather of a glass-fitter and painter. This trade, while it\r\ninitiated him into the principles of drawing, and gave him a certain\r\ninsight into chemical manipulations, at the same time aroused in him a\r\ntaste for art and the study of natural sciences. While “painting figures\r\nin order to gain his daily bread,” as he himself tells us in one of the\r\nworks he has left behind him, and which gives us the highest opinion of\r\nhis simple yet energetic nature, he applied himself to the study of the\r\ntrue principles of art in the works of the great Italian painters--the\r\nonly artists then in repute. Owing to various circumstances the trade\r\nof glazier proving unprofitable, he at once began the study of geometry,\r\nand soon obtained credit, in the part of the country wherein he dwelt,\r\nas “a clever draughtsman of plans.” Such comparatively mechanical labour\r\nas this could not long suffice for the active vigour of a mind thirsting\r\nafter progress and discovery. Moreover, Palissy, while employed on his\r\ncalling as a land-surveyor, had never ceased to give close observation\r\nto the structure and composition of geological strata. With the purpose\r\nof dispelling the doubts in his mind, and also with the object of\r\nobtaining substantial confirmation regarding the system he had already\r\noriginated, he began to travel. The result of his journeyings was the\r\ninauguration of a theory which, after having long been contemptuously\r\nrejected by the learned, was nevertheless destined to form the\r\nfoundation of principles which are now considered as the basis of modern\r\ngeological science.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--A figured Border of an Enamelled Dish, by\r\nBernard Palissy.]\r\n\r\nBut if the certain knowledge which Palissy thought he had acquired as to\r\nthe early convulsions of the globe had succeeded in satisfying his own\r\nmind, the glazier-surveyor (who was now a married man with a family)\r\nstill remained in straitened circumstances, and was obliged to find some\r\nmeans of avoiding actual want. We must refer to what he himself says\r\nmore than a quarter of a century later, and when success had completely\r\ncrowned his efforts, to learn what were his recollections of his early\r\nand hazardous experiments in a new channel. “Know,” says he, in his\r\nexpressive language, “that it is twenty-five years since an earthen\r\nvessel was shown to me; it was turned, enamelled, and of such exquisite\r\nbeauty, that from that very moment I began to argue with myself, while\r\nremembering observations made derisively to me by some persons when I\r\nwas painting figures. And seeing that they were beginning to give up the\r\nuse of these objects in the country where I lived, and that glazing also\r\nwas not in great demand, I set myself to think that had I but discovered\r\nthe art of making enamel, I might make earthen vessels and other\r\narticles of beautiful appearance; for God had given me the capacity to\r\nunderstand a little about ceramic painting, and from that instant,\r\nwithout in the least regarding my utter ignorance of siliceous\r\nsubstances, I set myself to discover enamels like a man groping in the\r\ndark.”\r\n\r\nIt has been much disputed, but we may as well say at once to no purpose,\r\nhow to assign with certainty a particular locality whence came this\r\nobject which inspired Palissy; but whatever may have been its origin, it\r\nseems to us to be a question of little moment, because at the time when\r\nPalissy must have seen it, the Italian manufactories, and even those\r\nwhich were afterwards established in various localities, had succeeded\r\nin disseminating their wares far and wide; and, besides this, the works\r\nof Palissy, which we still see, bear testimony to a style that was\r\npeculiarly his own, and in some measure original.\r\n\r\nHowever this may have been, here we have him seeking out and grinding\r\nall kinds of substances, mixing them, and coating with them pieces of\r\nware which he first subjected to the action of an ordinary potter’s\r\noven, afterwards to the more powerful heat employed by glass-makers.\r\nThen we see him building an oven in his own house--taking into his\r\nservice a working potter, to whom, on one occasion, when he has no money\r\nfor the payment of wages, he is obliged to give his own clothes; again\r\nwe find him turning, single-handed, a mill for grinding his materials\r\nwhich ordinarily required “two powerful men” to work it; then again,\r\nwounding his hands in repairing the oven that the fire cracked, and the\r\nbricks and mortar of which had become “liquified and vitrified;” so that\r\nhe is obliged for several days “to eat his soup with his fingers tied up\r\nin rags;” pushing the conscientiousness and zeal of an experimentalist\r\nso far as to fall down in a state of insensibility on finding that the\r\nwhole contents of an oven, on which he had been relying, proved to have\r\nnumerous defects. In despite\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIBERON OF HENRI II WARE.\r\n\r\nOr Oiron fayence. (Pourtales’ Collection.) Now in the possession of J.\r\nMalcolm, Esq.]\r\n\r\nof his poverty we see him destroying pieces of work that he considered\r\nwere not quite perfect, though a fair price was offered him for them,\r\nmerely because “they might bring discredit on him and loss of\r\nreputation;” and finally, we see him breaking up and putting into the\r\nfire, for want of other fuel, the flooring of his house and the\r\nfurniture of his humble abode.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent discovery, brought about by the single initiative of an\r\nindividual who had said that he would succeed, and who heroically\r\nendured all kinds of misery, privations, and humiliations, in order to\r\nattain his object, was the labour of not less than fifteen years.\r\n\r\n“To console me,” relates Palissy, “even those from whom I had a right to\r\nexpect help laughed at me” (he here alludes to his family--his wife, and\r\nchildren--who had not the same unbounded faith as himself in the\r\nultimate success of his labours); “they paraded the town exclaiming that\r\nI was burning the woodwork of my house; thus was my credit injured, and\r\nI was looked upon as a fool. Others said I was attempting to make base\r\ncoin. I went about quite humiliated, ashamed of myself. I owed money in\r\nseveral quarters, and generally had two children out at nurse, and not\r\nable to pay the cost. All ridiculed me, saying: ‘He deserves to starve,\r\nbecause he has given up his trade.’\r\n\r\n“Struggling on in this way, at the end of ten years I became so thin\r\nthat my legs and arms had no roundness of shape left about them; my legs\r\nwere all of a size (_toutes d’une venue_); so that as soon as I began to\r\nwalk, the garters with which I fastened my stockings used at once to\r\nslip down, stockings and all, on to my heels.... For many years, having\r\nnothing wherewith to cover my ovens, I was exposed all night long to the\r\nwinds and the rains, without receiving any help or consolation, except\r\nfrom the screech-owls hooting on one side and the dogs howling on the\r\nother.... Sometimes I found myself, with all my garments wet through\r\nfrom the rain, going to bed at midnight, or at dawn of day; and when\r\nproceeding in this condition to bed, I went reeling along without a\r\nlight, and stumbling from side to side, like a man drunk with wine; I\r\nwas overcome by previous sorrow, the more so because after\r\nlong-continued work I saw my labour lost. And on entering my chamber I\r\nfound a fresh persecution awaiting me--the complaints of my wife--worse\r\nthan the first, and which now makes me wonder how it was I did not die\r\nof grief.... I have been in such anguish that many and many a time I\r\nfancied I was at death’s door.”\r\n\r\nAt last, despite all these obstacles, disappointments, physical and\r\nmental suffering, the determined experimentalist succeeded in his\r\nanticipations, and gave to the world those works he called _rustics_,\r\nand which were so original and so beautiful that they had but to be seen\r\nin order to invite attention, and to gain for him all the praise, as\r\nwell as the profit, he received.\r\n\r\nWe have just intimated it was at Saintes that Palissy, when in search of\r\nimmortal fame, underwent his rude apprenticeship. A short time after he\r\nhad attained these definite results, religious questions having caused\r\nsome disturbances in Saintonge, the Constable de Montmorency, who had\r\nbeen sent to suppress the Huguenot rising, had an opportunity of seeing\r\nPalissy’s works: he requested that he should be presented to him, and at\r\nonce declared himself his friendly protector. And we must take this word\r\nprotector in its widest sense, for the potter, who had zealously\r\nembraced the doctrines of the Reformation, and who subsequently\r\npreferred to be imprisoned for life rather than abjure his faith (if he\r\ndid not die in the Bastille, at least he was imprisoned there at the\r\ntime of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew), indeed required protection, as\r\nmuch for the exercise of liberty of conscience as for carrying on his\r\nartistic labours. After Montmorency had commissioned him to execute some\r\nconsiderable works, which also gained him the patronage of several\r\nimportant personages, he obtained for him the favour of royalty. Palissy\r\nwas summoned to Paris, and received the title of “inventeur des\r\nrustiques figulines du roi et de la reine-mère”--Henri II. and Catherine\r\nde Médicis. He was lodged in the Tuileries; and was not long there\r\nbefore he became renowned, not only for his ceramic productions, but\r\nalso for his scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn the recent building operations at the Tuileries, on digging a trench\r\nin the garden, the workshop of Bernard Palissy was discovered; being\r\nrecognised by fragments and various pieces of enamelled pottery with\r\nfigures in relievo. Among these was found a large fragment of the dish\r\nof Palissy, known under the name of the Baptismal Dish, on account of\r\nthe subject represented thereon. In July, 1865, while excavating in the\r\npart of the palace where the “Salle des Etats” has been built, the\r\nworkmen discovered, below the level of the surface soil, two ovens for\r\nbaking pottery, in a tolerably good state of preservation. One contained\r\npieces of those muffles (_gazettes_) Palissy is said to have invented,\r\nand which were employed in baking delicate pieces of work--imprints of\r\nvarious kinds of ornaments, and figures in altorelievo: two of these\r\nare described by Palissy himself in the “Devis d’une grotte pour la\r\nroyne, mère du roy” (“device of a grotto for the queen, the king’s\r\nmother”), and which he thus indicates in the following sentence:--“I\r\nshould wish to make certain figures from nature, following her so\r\nclosely, even to the small hair in the beard and eyebrows, as to make\r\nthem the natural size.” These peculiarities are to be seen in the\r\nfragments of the moulds which have been discovered. In the same page\r\nPalissy says, “Also there would be another, composed completely of\r\nsea-shells of different kinds; that is to say, the two eyes of two\r\nshells, the nose, mouth, and chin, forehead and cheeks, all made out of\r\nsea-shells, as well as even the remainder of the body.” This was found\r\nin fragments, as also a hand moulded from nature, and holding a sword of\r\nancient make (Fig. 39). Among the fragments moulded from the naked and\r\nthe draped form, is the one which we give (Fig. 40); it is thus\r\ndescribed by Palissy:--“Also for the sake of astonishing mankind, I\r\nwished to make three or four (figures) draped, and with their hair\r\ndressed in quaint ways, whose dresses and head-dresses shall be of\r\ndivers linen, cloths, or striped materials so natural that no man would\r\nthink but it was the object itself which the workman had wished to\r\nimitate.”[4]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Ornamentation on Pottery by Bernard Palissy.]\r\n\r\nWe thus see how Palissy, called “Maître Bernard des Thuilleries,”\r\ndeserved the esteem of the sovereigns who desired he should be near\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nM. Jacquemart says of Palissy ware:--“It is remarkable in more ways than\r\none--for its white paste with a shade of yellowish grey, for its\r\nhardness, and its infusibility, equalling that of fine earthenware or\r\npipe-clay. These give it a special character, that distinguishes it from\r\nItalian productions, the clay of which is of a dirty and dusky red. The\r\nenamel has great brilliancy; it is hard, and is not unfrequently wavy\r\n(_tresaille_). The colours vary a little, but they are bright--pure\r\nyellow, yellow ochre, indigo blue, grey blue, emerald green produced\r\nfrom copper, yellow green, violet brown, and manganese violet. As for\r\nthe white, it is somewhat dull, and cannot be compared with Luca della\r\nRobbia ware; wherefore the most persevering researches of Palissy, who\r\ninvented all the processes which he employed in his work, aimed at the\r\nattainment of greater brilliancy. The under part of Palissy ware is\r\nnever of a uniform tone of colour; it is spotted or tinted with blue,\r\nyellow, and violet brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 39 and 40.--Fragments of Figures on which the\r\nmoulds have been found in one of Palissy’s Ovens at the Tuileries.]\r\n\r\n“It would be exceedingly difficult, not to say impossible, to enumerate\r\nthe various shapes he was able to give to his enamelled ware. Combining\r\nin\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--Goblet, by Bernard Palissy. (Museum of the\r\nLouvre.)]\r\n\r\nhimself all the artistic talent of his day, he was at the same time a\r\nskilful designer and an intelligent modeller; and thus he discovered a\r\nthousand resources for the display of elegance and richness; sometimes\r\nin the multiplicity of relievos and in the outline of his vases,\r\nsometimes in the mere application of colour.... In many of his\r\nproductions, particularly dishes and bowls, are seen natural objects\r\nrepresented with astonishing truthfulness as to form and colour; nearly\r\nall these are modelled from nature, and grouped with perfect taste; from\r\nthe lower surface, rippled by streams of water in which fish of the\r\nriver Seine are swimming, coiled reptiles rise gracefully from among\r\nfossil shells (we must remember that Palissy was a geologist), found in\r\nthe tertiary strata of Paris; on the _marli_ (the sloping edge of the\r\ndish), amidst delicate ferns arranged in masses, lizards, crayfish, and\r\nlarge-bodied frogs climb and jump (Fig. 42). The accuracy of their\r\nmovements, the truth of tones produced by a limited variety of\r\ncolours--all indicate a close observer. We must not, however, form our\r\nopinion of Palissy from these _rustic_ works alone, but also from his\r\nvases, where he introduced all the ornamental richness of those times,\r\nand on which he took a pleasure in developing all his fertility of\r\ncomposition and his knowledge as a designer.... On this point Palissy\r\nfollowed the same law to which all artists of the sixteenth century were\r\nsubject--he was a worker in precious metals. By their graceful\r\noriginality, their fringed (_frangées_) borders, their figured\r\naccessories, these vases put us in mind of metal. How could it have been\r\notherwise? Was not Benvenuto Cellini at that time, we will not say the\r\nobject of all imitations, for this would be an insult to the skilful\r\nartists of that period, but at all events the ideal towards which the\r\ninspirations of others were directed? As regards the human figure,\r\nPalissy’s constant endeavour was to approach the Italian type; and as\r\ndoubtless the school of Fontainebleau furnished him with most of his\r\nmodels, in the greater part of his figures we trace that graceful\r\n_elongation_ of form, that elegant simplicity, which, in the works of\r\nJean Goujon, fall into mannerism (Figs. 43 and 44).\r\n\r\n“Palissy did not limit himself to the production of small and\r\nmoderate-sized vases for ornamenting sideboards, buffets, tables, and\r\nbrackets; he raised pottery to the most gigantic proportions in his\r\n_rustiques figulines_, intended as ornaments for gardens, grottoes,\r\nfountains, and the halls of stately mansions. The castles of Nesle and\r\nof Chaulnes, of Reux and of Ecouen, and the garden of the Tuileries,\r\ncontained some remarkable specimens. All have perished with the\r\ndevastation of the buildings in which they stood; a single fragment of a\r\ncapital, preserved in the Museum of Sèvres, proves the truthfulness of\r\nthe writers of the sixteenth century regarding the monumental creations\r\nof the potter of Saintes.\r\n\r\n“After the death of Palissy, in 1589, the art which he had created\r\ninsensibly declined, until soon it almost completely disappeared in\r\nFrance.”\r\n\r\nThis latter remark has reference to the style which was peculiarly of\r\nPalissy’s own invention, and not to the production of ceramic works\r\ngenerally; though the art failed not to give evidence of a certain\r\nvitality,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Enamelled Dish, by Bernard Palissy. (Museum of\r\nthe Louvre.)]\r\n\r\nit employed as guides or models the fanciful examples of Italian ware,\r\nin preference to the really masterly specimens of the French artist.\r\nAmong the different centres of manufacture which, at that period, were\r\ndeserving of notoriety, we must specially name Nevers, whence came\r\nnumerous examples characterised by subjects taken from biblical\r\nnarratives, as well as from Roman and contemporaneous times; Rouen,\r\nwhere the manufacture probably was not of an earlier date than the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century, and which evidently had to provide\r\nits full supply of dishes for the table when, owing to the heavy\r\nexpenses of war, the courtiers, following the example of Louis XIV.,\r\nsent their plate to the mint, and “_se mirent en faïence_,” “took to\r\nearthenware,” as Saint-Simon says. Lastly we have Montreuil-sur-Mer,\r\nwhich, if we are to credit the specimens collected in the district by M.\r\nBoucher de Perthes, one of our most learned antiquarians, possessed a\r\nmanufactory that produced some remarkable “open-work” vases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Four-handled Water-jug. German ware of the\r\nSixteenth Century.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Egg-shaped Coffee-pot. German ware of the\r\nSixteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nLet us also mention the Dutch pottery, called _Delft ware_, which, in\r\nthe beginning of the seventeenth century, began to find a place on all\r\nsideboards and dressers. According to M. Brongniart, these came from a\r\nmanufactory founded prior, perhaps, to the sixteenth century. We also\r\ninstance the fine earthenware, in relievo, manufactured with undoubted\r\nability in Germany, especially in the town of Nuremberg. In the Louvre\r\nand in the Cluny Museums may be seen magnificent specimens of enamelled\r\nslabs and vases of architectural forms, ornamented with figures.\r\nMajolica was equally esteemed on the banks of the Rhine. Many specimens\r\nare found, dating from the latest years of the sixteenth century, in\r\nwhich identity of form or similarity of _sigles_ (earths or clays) to\r\nprimitive works had led to their being, at first, classified among\r\nItalian majolica. However, the majority of these examples, ornamented\r\nwith escutcheons and arabesques, combined generally with Latin or German\r\ninscriptions, bear on the reverse a cipher in Gothic letters, leaving no\r\ndoubt as to the artist’s country.\r\n\r\nNow a word on a question we ought not to pass in silence, though it yet\r\nremains unanswered, and doubtless will never be explained.\r\n\r\nWhy is this name of _faïence_ commonly given in France, almost from the\r\nrevival of the ceramic art, to the productions of the new industry? Some\r\nsay, “because Faenza was the first among Italian manufactories that\r\nintroduced, generally, painted and ornamented potteries into France,\r\nwhere it acquired great reputation.” Others discover in France itself, a\r\nsmall town called Faïence, near Fréjus, in Provence, “where the\r\nmanufacture of enamelled clays was in full activity before there was any\r\nevidence of it elsewhere;” and thus it gave its name to the pottery\r\ncalled _majolica_ by the Italians: this would be nothing less than to\r\ndeprive Luca della Robbia of the merit, if not of the invention, at\r\nleast of priority. Unfortunately for this last opinion, those who state\r\nit cannot bring in support of their assertion any certain details of the\r\nnature of the productions ascribed to that locality, and which by their\r\nvery celebrity ought to have been safe from destruction. Thus it is\r\nevident there is here a point of dispute regarding which it is difficult\r\nto form a decisive opinion.\r\n\r\nThough, in a certain measure, lying out of the province to which our\r\nobservations have hitherto been limited, we have still to notice a small\r\ngroup of productions which are known by connoisseurs under the title of\r\n_faïences fines d’Henri II._; of these there are not more than forty\r\nauthenticated specimens. The locality of this manufacture, which seems,\r\nso to speak, to have been isolated--for the ware is unlike any\r\ncontemporaneous productions--is quite unknown. “We only know,” says M.\r\nJacquemart, “that most of the examples came from the south-west of\r\nFrance, from Saumur, from Tours, and especially from Thouars. As to the\r\ndate, it is indelibly inscribed on the vases, some having the salamander\r\nof Francis I., others the arms of France with three crescents\r\ninterlaced, the emblem adopted by Henri II. They consist of cups, ewers,\r\ndrinking-vases, oval sugar-basins, salt-cellars, and candlesticks. The\r\nform is ornate and pure, and is relieved by elegant mouldings. On the\r\nclay--a yellowish white, and covered with a crystallized varnish, the\r\nbasis of which is lead, and consequently is transparent--wind bands of\r\nyellow ochre bordered with dark brown, and interlaced with all the\r\ninventive richness which characterized the period; small designs in\r\ngreen, violet, black, and occasionally in red, enhance this decoration.”\r\n\r\nMuch search has been made, but, as yet, without any reliable result, for\r\nthe name of the artist to whom might be attributed the creation of these\r\nworks, and of the individual style they denote.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, if England claims the first application of\r\npipe-clay to fine earthenware, the French can, by showing her the\r\n_faïence d’Henry II._, prove that, two hundred years before, an unknown\r\nartist in France was setting an example in that art in which England now\r\nprides herself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Ornament of a Dish, Italian ware.

But any one who has at all\r\nstudied the ancient historians and the annals of our earliest career as\r\na people, will not fail to recognise, as so many constituent parts\r\ncombining to form the equipment of war, most of those weapons that were\r\nadopted among various races, the contests and the union of which was to\r\ngive birth to modern nations.\r\n\r\nIf we can rely on the testimony of some miniatures in manuscripts of the\r\ntime of Charlemagne, Roman customs are constantly recalled in the\r\ncostume and arms of the warriors of the eighth and ninth centuries (Fig.\r\n46), “but with the modifications necessarily resulting from\r\ncontemporaneous corrupt taste,” as observed by M. de Saulcy, whom, it\r\nmay be remarked, we follow step by step, as it were, in the labours\r\nwhich he has conscientiously devoted to the history of warlike arms;\r\n“for at that time the helmets, the bucklers, and the swords had assumed\r\nforms very unlike the models whereof they were supposed to be an\r\nimitation. One can readily imagine that costume had become subjected to\r\nthe same sort of change as language, corrupted as this was by the\r\nadmixture of German manners with those of the nations subjected to\r\nRome.”\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the ninth century the Normans disembarking, possessed\r\nthemselves of Neustria, and introduced among the French nation, with\r\nwhich they at first contended, and at length concluded a peace, an\r\nentire series of defensive arms entirely novel in form, if not in their\r\nnature. It is then, according to certain learned men, that warriors are\r\nseen, in illustrated manuscripts, attired in dresses furnished with\r\nsmall rings or iron scales, wearing pointed helmets, and using shields\r\ncut horizontally above, and terminating at the base in a point more or\r\nless sharp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Gallo-Romano Soldiers. Fac-simile of Miniatures\r\nin the MS. of Prudentius. (Imp. Library of Paris.)]\r\n\r\nIn the Bayeux tapestry we see the army of William that fought the battle\r\nof Hastings composed of three different bodies of troops: the archers,\r\nlight infantry, armed with arrows and darts; foot-soldiers, or Heavy\r\ninfantry, using weightier arms, and clad in iron mail; and cavalry, in\r\nthe midst of which figures the Duke William (Fig. 47).\r\n\r\nThe costume exhibits little variety; only two sorts of accoutrements are\r\nobservable; one very plain, worn by men who have no helmet, is evidently\r\nthat of an inferior soldier; the other, covered with iron rings, not\r\ninterlaced, extends from the shoulders to the knees, and belongs only\r\nto warriors whose head-dress is a narrow, conical helmet, more or less\r\nsharply pointed, extending behind (_en couvre nuque_) to cover the nape\r\nof the neck (Fig. 48), and in front provided with a metal protector for\r\nthe face, called the _nasal_.\r\n\r\nAmong the horsemen thus encased in iron, are some who have boots and\r\nstirrups, others are without them, and even wear no spurs. Their shields\r\nare convex, secured to the arm by a leather strap, generally circular at\r\ntop, and terminating in a point below. Some, however, are polygonal and\r\nconvex, and in the centre show a rather long point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--King William, as represented on his seal\r\npreserved in England.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--Lancer of William’s Army.]\r\n\r\nOffensive arms consist of swords, axes, lances, javelins, and arrows.\r\nThe swords are long, of uniform width nearly to the extremity which\r\ncomes abruptly to a point, and have heavy, strong hilts. The axes\r\nexhibit no remarkable peculiarity. The spears terminate in an iron\r\npoint, probably sharpened, and equal in length to one-sixth of the\r\nhandle. We see also clubs, maces, and, finally, pronged staves (_bâtons\r\nfourchus_), doubtless the earliest form of the weapon; these last were\r\nsubsequently called _bisaguë_, and, with maces and clubs, were\r\nordinarily used by serfs and peasants; the sword and the spear being\r\nreserved for freemen.\r\n\r\nThe sling is not to be found in the hands of any warrior; but it is\r\nremarkable that, in the border of the Bayeux tapestry, it is used by a\r\npeasant aiming at a bird; from which it may be inferred that the sling\r\nhad become a mere weapon for field-sport. Moreover, this was also the\r\ncase with the bow among the French; which was again held in honour after\r\nthe advent of the Normans, especially since the latter could ascribe to\r\nit their success at the battle of Hastings, where Harold, the opponent\r\nof William, was killed by an arrow. Nevertheless, the statutes of the\r\nConqueror, who himself excelled with the bow, did not include that\r\nweapon among those of the nobility.\r\n\r\nFrom the conquest of the Normans to the Crusades, we scarcely find\r\nanything worth notice, except the adoption of a very murderous implement\r\nof war, which acquired the name of the flail, or armed whip (_fléau_, or\r\n_fouet d’armes_); it was formed of iron balls studded with points, and\r\nwas attached to the end of a strong staff by small chains. But we come\r\nto a period when the events which occurred in Asia had a considerable\r\ninfluence on the arms and the military costume of Europe. The first and\r\nprincipal of the importations due to those distant expeditions was that\r\nof the coat of mail, then in common use among the Arabs, and which has\r\nsince been discovered in the sculptures of the period of the Sassanidæ,\r\na royal race that ruled over Persia from the third to the seventh\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIt is not affirmed that prior to the first crusade we had no knowledge\r\nof iron chain-work, of which the Orientals made defensive helmets; but\r\nwe imitated it only in a heavy and clumsy manner. This armour, which was\r\nof ponderous weight, and, besides, was far from rendering invulnerable\r\nthose who were burdened with it, had not displaced the _haubergeons_,\r\nthe _jacques de fer_, the _brigandines_, the _armures à macles_ (Fig.\r\n49), (such were the names given to the cuirasses of leather and of cloth\r\ncovered with metal plates); but when such defensive armour came to be\r\nbetter known, with all its original good qualities; and when we had\r\nlearned to make it according to the Oriental method, there was no\r\nfurther delay in adopting that network of iron (_tricot_) at once\r\nflexible, light, and, in some degree, impenetrable. However, since the\r\nmanufacture of ancient armour was more simple, and consequently less\r\ncostly, it was not altogether abandoned. It is only so late as the time\r\nof Philip Augustus and Louis IX. (the thirteenth century) that the use\r\nof coats of mail became general; to this some knights attached mail\r\nhose, to protect the thighs, legs, and feet (Fig. 50).\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Louis le Gros (twelfth century) we see the first attempt\r\nat a movable vizor adapted to the conical helmet of the Normans; and to\r\nthe same period must be referred the invention of the crossbow: or, it\r\nmay rather be said that a stock, or _arbrier_, was added to the bow,\r\nwhich afforded greater facility for stretching the string, and also\r\naided in directing the arrow. This new weapon, after being exclusively\r\nused in the chase, appeared in warfare; but, in 1139, Pope Innocent II.,\r\nconfirming the decisions of the Council of Lateran, which had condemned\r\nit as too destructive, prohibited its use. The crossbow was not restored\r\nto military equipments until the third crusade, under Richard Cœur de\r\nLion, who, having permitted his men to resume the weapon, was\r\nsubsequently assumed to have invented it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--Norman Archer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--Jean Sansterre, as represented on his Seal.\r\nReproduced by Meyrick.]\r\n\r\nDuring the first crusade, barons and knights wore a hauberk of links of\r\niron or steel. Every warrior had a helmet--silver-plated for royalty, of\r\nsteel for nobles, and of iron for the private soldiers. The crusaders\r\nused the lance, the sword, a kind of dagger called _miséricorde_, the\r\nclub and the battle-axe, the sling and the bow.\r\n\r\nIn the windows which Suger, minister of Louis VII., caused to be painted\r\nfor the church of the abbey of Saint-Denis, and which represented the\r\nprincipal events of the second crusade, we see the chiefs of the\r\ncrusaders still clothed in hauberks of links, or _macles_ (plates of\r\niron); the helmet is conical and without the nose-piece (_nasal_); and,\r\nlastly, the buckler, formed like a scutcheon, covers the breast,\r\ngenerally suspended from the neck by a leather thong.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the twelfth century, the iron breastplate is said\r\nto have been introduced; it was placed over the chest to support the\r\nhauberk, the direct pressure of which being found detrimental to health.\r\nBut no description of it is to be met with in the romances of chivalry,\r\nthat furnish the best documentary evidence regarding the armour of the\r\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--Helmet of Don Jaime el Conquistador (Armeria\r\nReal, Madrid.)]\r\n\r\nUnder Philip Augustus, who, as we know, was one of the leaders of the\r\nthird crusade, the conical helmet assumed a cylindrical form; to this\r\nwas occasionally added a vizor called _ventail_, intended to protect the\r\nface. Richard I., King of England, is represented on his seal with this\r\nkind of helmet; level with the eyes and also at the height of the mouth\r\nare two horizontal slits, which admit of seeing and breathing. Still the\r\nuse of the conical helmet without vizor or nose-piece was retained even\r\nto the thirteenth century in Spain, as is proved by that worn by Jaime\r\nI., King of Aragon (Fig. 51), which is preserved in the Armeria Real,\r\nMadrid. It is of polished steel, is surmounted by a dragon’s head, and\r\nportions of it are richly ornamented.\r\n\r\nThus in the third crusade the use of the “coat-of-arms” became\r\ngeneral,--a sort of overcoat, if we may so term it, of cloth or of silk\r\nstuff, and the purpose of which, at first, was only to mitigate the\r\ninsupportable effect of the rays of an Eastern sun on metal armour. This\r\nnew garment soon served, moreover, when made of various colours, to\r\ndistinguish different nations marching under the standard of the Cross\r\n(Fig. 52). It became really a dress of military splendour, was made of\r\nthe richest stuffs, and embroidered in gold or silver with excessive\r\nrefinement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--Knight in his Hauberk (after Meyrick).]\r\n\r\nThe slingers, who had never been otherwise recruited than from the\r\nlower orders, disappeared from the French armies after the reign of St.\r\nLouis. As for the archers, those of England wore at that time, over the\r\nhauberk, a leather jacket, adopted subsequently by the French archers,\r\nand called _jacque d’Anglois_. An old author, in fact, thus mentions\r\nit:--\r\n\r\n   “C’étoit un pourpoint de chamois;\r\n    Farci de bourre sus et sous;\r\n    Un grand vilain jacque d’Anglois,\r\n    Qui lui pendoit jusqu’aux genoux.”\r\n\r\nThe _jacque_ having become the fashion in France was soon recognised in\r\nevery kind of material more or less costly; it continued in use until\r\nthe end of the fourteenth century; Charles VI. wore one of black velvet\r\nduring a journey he made in Brittany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--Helmet of Hughes, Vidame of Chalons. (End of\r\nThirteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.--Tournament Helmet, screwed on the Breastplate.\r\n(End of Fifteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nThe casque, or helmet, from that time enclosing the head entirely,\r\nassumed, under St. Louis, the form of two truncated cones “réunis par\r\nleurs grandes bases.” In addition to the helmet there was also worn at\r\nthat time the _chapel de fer_, which at first was only a simple cap\r\nunderneath the hood of the hauberk; but when, curtailing the hood, a\r\nbrim was added to the cap, it thus became a hat almost of the form of\r\nthe felts now in use. To protect the neck there was also attached to the\r\nrim of the hat a tippet of mail, falling on the shoulders, and called\r\n_camail_.[5] The iron cap then took\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASQUE, MORION, AND HELMETS.\r\n\r\nWith and without vizors, from the Armeria Real at Madrid.]\r\n\r\nthe name of _coiffre_ or _cervelière_, and later it became a kind of\r\nreversed pot concealing the entire head, and kept in position by its\r\nweight only (Fig. 53).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--Plain Armour of the Fifteenth Century, about\r\n1460. (Museum of Artillery, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nAgain; there had for some time been manifested a movement which\r\ngradually caused the knights to be entirely cased in iron. A king of\r\nScotland, contemporary with Philip Augustus, is represented on his seal\r\nwith a plate of armour intended to protect the elbow. The knee-cap\r\nfollowed. Under Philip the Bold, successor of St. Louis, the iron\r\n_grévières_ (greaves), or half leg-pieces, protecting the front of the\r\nlegs, were adopted. In the reign of Philip the Fair we have the first\r\nexample of an iron gauntlet with its fingers separate and jointed:\r\npreviously it was merely an inflexible piece covering the back of the\r\nhand. About the same time the _cervelière_, either flat or spherical,\r\nbecame pointed at the top, and took the name of _bassinet_; but this\r\nbassinet was unlike the casque which, in the following century,\r\nretained that name and was made completely closed. The exact period of\r\nthe transition from mailed armour to that of plain iron or steel, called\r\nalso plate-armour, dates from the first thirty years of the fifteenth\r\ncentury (Fig. 55).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--Convex Armour of the Fifteenth Century, said to\r\nbe that of Maximilian. (Museum of Artillery, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nThe annals of Florence contain a statute of 1315, requiring every\r\nhorseman serving in a campaign to have a helmet, a breastplate,\r\ngauntlets, cuishes, and leg-pieces, all of iron; but in France and\r\nEngland the whole of these pieces were not adopted until somewhat later.\r\nIn the reigns of Philip V. and Charles IV. we see the ventail of the\r\nhelmet with a grating, and the vizor opening with a hinge. The\r\nbassinet, lighter than the helmet, was at first worn by the knight when\r\nno hostile encounter was anticipated; but subsequently, and at an early\r\ndate, the vizor was added to the bassinet, as well as to the casque; and\r\nthen it became as much used as the helmet, which, towards the end of the\r\nfourteenth century, was abandoned.\r\n\r\nAbout the same period some portions of iron horse-armour began to make\r\ntheir appearance. We find entered in the inventory of the armour of\r\nLouis X., a _chanfrein_ (a plate of iron fastened on the horse’s\r\nforehead).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--Crossbow Men protected by Shield-bearers.\r\nFifteenth Century. After a Miniature from the Chronicles of Froissart.\r\n(MS. Bibl. Imp. de Paris.)]\r\n\r\nThe crossbow, for some time prohibited by ecclesiastical authority, was\r\nthe weapon most in use at the period spoken of; as having the double\r\nadvantage of being drawn with more power than the ordinary bow, and of\r\nthrowing its arrows to a longer distance with greater precision.\r\nHistorians say that at Crécy, in 1346, there were fifteen thousand\r\ncrossbow men in the French army. The Genoese were considered the most\r\nskilful in Europe; and next, those of Paris. A manuscript in the\r\nBritish Museum shows them wearing iron helmets, _brassières_,[6] and\r\nleg-pieces; and for body-covering, jackets with long, hanging sleeves.\r\nWhile the bowmen had both hands occupied in discharging their arrows,\r\nshield-bearers were employed to protect them by means of large bucklers\r\n(Fig. 57).\r\n\r\nIn the year 1338 the use of firearms is for the first time noted in\r\nFrance. But we think it right to reserve all we have to say of these\r\nmodern offensive weapons until our history of the ancient system of\r\narmour is finished. Considering the early imperfections of firearms, the\r\nold system must have long continued, especially among combatants of\r\nnoble degree--for they affected contempt for the new warlike equipments,\r\nby means of which personal valour became in a manner useless and could\r\nno longer ensure victory in battle.\r\n\r\nUnder John the Good, that is, in the middle of the fourteenth century,\r\nplain armour was generally adopted; the long coat of mail, heavier and\r\nless convenient, was entirely abandoned; but chain-armour still covered\r\ncertain parts of the body not yet protected by iron plates. The\r\n_bassinet_, then very pointed, was furnished with mail, covering the\r\nneck and a portion of the shoulders. The upper part of the arm was\r\nprotected by a half-armlet, called the _épaulette_, but the lower part\r\nwas provided with mail.\r\n\r\nOrnaments began to be introduced in armour in the reign of Charles V.;\r\nuntil that time it had a simple and plain appearance. For instance, the\r\n_camail_ of the _bassinet_ is embroidered on the shoulders with gold and\r\nsilver, and the point surmounting it is decorated with an imitation of\r\nfoliage--an ornament which, according to the “Chronicle of Du Gueslin,”\r\nhad the disadvantage of presenting a kind of handle to an opponent. The\r\ncuirass, to which it was then deemed sufficient to impart a bright\r\npolish, or to paint in ordinary colours, sometimes bright, sometimes\r\ndark, began to be engraved and chased towards the end of the following\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Charles VI. there was introduced, for the first time,\r\nfour or five flexible plates, called _faldes_, which protected the lower\r\npart of the stomach without impeding the movements of the body. A little\r\nlater, _tassettes_ were added; they were attached to the top of the\r\nthigh to guard the hips and the groin. It appears that at this period\r\nthe artisans of Milan, were especially renowned for the manufacture of\r\narmour; for Froissart relates that Henry IV., King of England, when Earl\r\nof Derby,[7] and preparing to enter the lists with the Duke of Norfolk,\r\nrequested armour from Galeas, Duke of Milan, who sent it with four\r\nMilanese armourers. The swords and spears made at Toulouse and at\r\nBordeaux were also held in great repute; so also were the double-handed\r\nswords in use from the middle of the thirteenth century, and\r\nmanufactured at Lubeck, in Germany. The steel helmets of Montauban were\r\nalso much in request.\r\n\r\nTowards the commencement of the fifteenth century, engines of war,\r\ndistinct from those in which powder was used, had attained a remarkable\r\ndegree of perfection. When John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, marched\r\nupon Paris, in 1411, there was with his army a considerable number of\r\nmachines called _ribaudequins_, a species of gigantic crossbow drawn by\r\na horse, and which with enormous strength threw javelins to a great\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nUnder Charles VII., the breastplate of the cuirass was composed of two\r\nparts: one covered the breast; the other, reaching to the hips,\r\nprotected the stomach, and was attached to the former by clasps and\r\nleather straps. Generally the breastplate was convex.\r\n\r\nTaught by the disastrous defeat of Agincourt,--where ten thousand men,\r\nof whom eight thousand were of the nobility, had fallen, owing to the\r\nprecision and the celerity of the fire of the English archers,--Charles\r\nVII. instituted in France the _franc archer_ (Fig. 58), who wore the\r\n_salade_ and the jacket or _brigandine_, and carried the dagger, the\r\nsword, the bow, the quiver or crossbow _garnie_. These archers were\r\nexempt from all taxes or imposts; their equipments were declared not\r\ndistrainable for debts, and during war they received pay at the rate of\r\nfour livres a month.\r\n\r\nThe _salade_, a part of armour which has remained particularly\r\ncelebrated, and the name of which has been applied subsequently to\r\nhelmets of divers forms, is pre-eminently the helmet of the epoch of\r\nCharles VII. At first it was a head-dress for war, composed of a simple\r\ncap (_timbre_), that covered the top of the head, with a pendent piece\r\nof metal of greater or less length at the back, which sometimes was made\r\nfor protecting the neck, and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--Franc Archers (Fifteenth Century), from the\r\nPainted Hangings of the Town of Rheims.]\r\n\r\nsometimes to guard a portion of the shoulders. Towards the end of the\r\nfifteenth century there was added to the salade a small vizor, that was\r\ngradually lengthened downwards to near the upper lip, and in which a\r\nnarrow opening was then made for the sight. In the reign of Louis XII.\r\nthe salade received a chin-piece, the lower part of which was a\r\n_gorget_, that surrounded and protected the neck. The top of the cuirass\r\nhad a cord, to which was attached the salade; and this helmet, so\r\ndifferent to the primitive salade, continued to bear the same name (Fig.\r\n59).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--Knights in complete Armour, with the _Salade_.\r\n(End of Fifteenth Century.) A Single Combat, taken from “The Triumph of\r\nMaximilian,” by Burgmayer, after a drawing by Albert Dürer.]\r\n\r\nThe _brigandine_, recalling the early armour abandoned for the coat of\r\nmail, was composed of small plates of steel or iron arranged on a strong\r\npiece of leather, and stitched or fixed with wire, in the form of the\r\nscales of a fish. A decree of Peter II., Duke of Brittany, issued in\r\n1450, ordered the nobles to equip themselves as archers, or in\r\nbrigandine, if they knew how to use arrows; but otherwise, to be\r\nprovided with _guisarmes_, with good salades, and leg-armour; each noble\r\nwas to be attended by one _coustillier_, and to have two good horses.\r\nThe _guisarme_ was a sort of two-edged and pointed javelin. The\r\n_coustillier_ was a foot-soldier, or a horseman, whose duty it was to\r\nact as a servant to the nobleman, and to carry the _coustille_, a long,\r\nslender sword, triangular or square, apparently resembling the foil in\r\nour fencing-rooms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--Armour ornamented with Lions, supposed to be\r\nthat of Louis XII. (Museum of Artillery, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nAbout this period French noblemen displayed much magnificence in the\r\nadornment of the _chanfrein_ of their horses. For instance, we know that\r\nat the siege of Harfleur, in 1449, the charger of the Count de Saint-Pol\r\nhad on its head a massive gold chanfrein, of the most delicate work,\r\nvalued at not less than twenty thousand crowns. In the same year, at the\r\nsiege of Bayonne, the Count de Foix entered the conquered city mounted\r\non a horse whose chanfrein of polished steel was enriched with gold and\r\nprecious stones to the value of fifteen thousand gold crowns.\r\n\r\nHalf a century later--that is, in the reign of Charles VIII. and that of\r\nLouis XII.--chargers wore, besides the chanfrein, the _manefaire_,\r\nprotecting the neck, the _poitrail_, the _croupière_, the _flancois_,\r\nwhich respectively covered the chest, the back, and the flanks of the\r\nhorse; and to these was added another piece of armour placed under the\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nOf the date of Louis XII., we still see embossed suits of armour\r\nornamented with fluting, sometimes blended with beautiful engraved work\r\nexecuted in the metal by the use of aquafortis, or subjects in relievo\r\nproduced by embossing: ornamentation of this nature elevated the\r\nequipments of the warrior to real works of art (Fig. 60).\r\n\r\nLouis XII. was the first to admit Greek mercenaries into his army. These\r\nwere named _stradiots_; they tendered their military services equally to\r\nboth Turks and Christians. The armour of these troops consisted of a\r\ncuirass with sleeves and gauntlets in mail, and over this a jacket; on\r\ntheir head a vizorless helmet was worn. The stradiots were armed with a\r\nlarge sword, called a _braquemart_, much resembling the Turkish sword,\r\nbut with a cross-handle; the sword and its scabbard were ornamented with\r\nGrecian devices. They carried in addition several small arms at the\r\nsaddle-bow, and also a _zagaye_, a very long lance, tipped at both\r\nextremities with iron.\r\n\r\nAt this period also was introduced the _pertuisane_,[8] the blade of\r\nwhich, wider than that of the lance, formed a crescent immediately above\r\nthe handle.\r\n\r\nThere were at that time two kinds of cross-bows--one for discharging\r\nbolts, the other for bullets. The bow was slung by means of a\r\n_moulinet_, a kind of hand-winch.\r\n\r\nEmbossed and fluted armour was not the only kind used in France and in\r\nItaly at the end of the fifteenth and the commencement of the following\r\ncentury. The monuments in the former country of the time of Louis XII.,\r\nand on the other side of the Alps, show how prevalent was a peculiar\r\ndescription of plain armour, whereof the cuirass, which was longer than\r\nthat of the embossed armour, had a rib or raised line in the middle.\r\nThis rib, which completely altered the character of the cuirass, in that\r\nit served to turn aside the thrust of the lance, became increasingly\r\ndistinctive as the seventeenth century drew near.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Francis I. embossed and ribbed armour were equally\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.--Damaskeened Armour of the end of the Sixteenth\r\nCentury. (Portrait of François, Duc d’Alençon, from Montfaucon’s “La\r\nMonarchie Françoise.”)]\r\n\r\nused (Fig. 61). In the Museum of Artillery, in Paris, is preserved the\r\narmour which that king wore at the battle of Pavia. The body is longer\r\nthan in the cuirass of the preceding century, the rib in the centre is\r\nmore raised, the gusset of the shoulder-piece is made of several\r\nmovable plates, and of large size. The _casque_, a generic name given\r\nsince those times to all descriptions of head-armour, assumed a\r\ncomfortable and elegant shape, which was maintained as long as the use\r\nof armour continued.\r\n\r\nAnother cuirass of the same date, still longer in the body, was made to\r\nturn up towards the lower extremity, and then took an inward bend to fit\r\nthe hip. It was made with movable plates overlapping from below; this\r\nallowed the wearer to stoop, which it was almost impossible to do when\r\nthe breast-piece and the back-piece were in one. Sometimes these plates\r\nwere only three or four in number over the stomach, and the others over\r\nthe breast were only represented, not genuine plates.\r\n\r\nThe armour called _à éclisse_, or _à écrevisse_, worn at a certain\r\nperiod by the halberdiers, must not be passed over; it received this\r\nname because the cuirass was made of horizontal plates (_éclisses_),\r\nthree or four inches in width, which, though they covered the entire\r\nbody, did not in any way impede its movements.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, refer to a peculiarity in this armour which prevented\r\nits general adoption; it was that as the movement or “play” of the\r\n_éclisses_ made it convenient to wear, so from this flexibility it was\r\nfound that the plates frequently became disconnected, and thus left a\r\npart of the body defenceless. In making the _éclisses_ to overlap from\r\nbelow, regard was had to the usual direction of a sword-cut or\r\ndagger-thrust, which usually came from below; but there was all the more\r\ndanger from blows of the _martel_[9] and battle-axe, the stroke of which\r\nweapon was directed downwards.\r\n\r\nBronzed armour came in about the middle of the sixteenth century, and\r\nwas somewhat commonly worn in 1558; it was introduced on account of its\r\nbeing far more easily kept clean than polished steel. For the same\r\nreason black armour was tried, but the engravings and chasings, the\r\ngildings and damaskeenings were more effective on the greenish ground;\r\nconsequently black varnish was given up in favour of bronze. At the end\r\nof the sixteenth century, and during the long civil wars which desolated\r\nFrance, armour took a variety of shapes, and as regards ornamentation at\r\nleast, there was generally to be seen a strange medley of the style of\r\nthe previous century with that of the period (Fig. 61). However, the\r\ndecline of the use of armour, which became in a measure inevitable, was\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\nDe la Noue, an eminent Huguenot officer of the time of Charles IX.,\r\nsays, in his “Discours Militaires”--“The penetrating power of pikes and\r\narquebuses has very naturally led to the adoption of armour stronger and\r\nmore capable of great resistance than formerly. It is now so heavy that\r\none is laden with anvils rather than protected by armour. Our\r\nmen-at-arms and light cavalry in Henry II.’s time presented a much finer\r\nappearance, with their helmets, their brassarts, tassets,[10] and the\r\nmorion,[11] carrying the lance with a flag; their armour was not so\r\nheavy but that a strong man was able to support its weight for\r\ntwenty-four hours; but those of the present day are so ponderous that a\r\nyoung knight of thirty has his shoulders quite crippled.”\r\n\r\nThus, in endeavouring to make the resistance of armour keep pace with\r\nthe improvement in new warlike engines, they rendered it useless;\r\nbecause the weight was intolerable, especially in warm weather, during\r\nlong marches, or in lengthened combats. Having vainly tried to make\r\nsuits of armour invulnerable, men began to leave off wearing such\r\nportions as were of minor importance, which by degrees were entirely\r\ndiscontinued. Under Louis XIII. we see armour undergoing further\r\nmodifications, but of fashion rather than of utility: finally, there is\r\nevery reason to think that the magnificent armour presented by the\r\nRepublic of Venice to Louis XIV., in 1668, and which is now to be seen\r\nin the Museum of Artillery in Paris, was one of the latest sets made in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nLet us now retrace our steps to examine a series of arms, the gradual\r\nadoption of which was destined to completely change the art of warfare.\r\n\r\nIt is now the almost universal opinion that the invention of\r\ngunpowder,--assumed to have been discovered in 1256, or at all events\r\nits application to artillery, which first dates from 1280,--is due to\r\nBerthold Schwartz, an Augustin friar, born at Fribourg. Some writers,\r\nhowever, make these dates a century later, and affirm that powder and\r\ncannons were first known from 1330 to 1380. Nevertheless, the employment\r\nof artillery only became general during the wars of Charles-Quint and of\r\nFrancis I., that is, towards 1530, or two centuries after its\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps in place of giving, as we have done, the unconditional\r\nacceptation to the word _artillery_ which it now has, we ought perhaps\r\nto have said artillery used with gunpowder; for long before the\r\ninvention of gunpowder the word _artillery_ was employed when speaking\r\nof all machines or engines of war (Fig. 62). Thus in the middle of the\r\nthirteenth century we find among the _personnel_ of the _artillery_ a\r\ngrand master of the crossbow men, masters of the engines, of the\r\ncannoniers (the word _cannon_ was even then applied to the tube forming\r\none of the principal portions of an engine for hurling projectiles), and\r\nin 1291 we see Philip the Fair appointing a grand master of the\r\nartillery of the Louvre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.--Engine for hurling Stones; taken from a\r\nMiniature of the Chevalier au Cygne. (Bibl. Imp. de Paris, No. 340, S.\r\nE.)]\r\n\r\nIn order to follow methodically the progress of the manufacture of arms\r\nsuch as we shall call novel, we will, in the first place, treat\r\nseparately of the engines of large calibre which were first employed,\r\nand then of portable arms.\r\n\r\nThe earliest allusion to cannons in France is found in 1338, in an\r\naccount of the treasurer of war, wherein we read:--“To Henri de\r\nVaumechon, for buying powder and other necessaries for cannons,” which\r\nhad been used at the siege of Puy-Guilhem, in Périgord.\r\n\r\nIn Froissart, we next find that, in 1340, the inhabitants of Quesnoy,\r\nwhen repelling the attack of the French, made use of bombards and cannon\r\nwhich hurled huge bolts at the besiegers. But the statement of Villani,\r\nthat the English were indebted to the employment of artillery for the\r\nvictory of Crécy, in 1346, must be treated as a pure invention, because\r\nit is certain that the firearms which may have been in use at that time\r\nwere in no way suited to field warfare; and that they were only employed\r\nwith the older engines in the attack and defence of fortresses. Not only\r\ndid their cumbrous weight and the rude construction of their carriages\r\nrender them extremely difficult of transport, but, intended as they were\r\nto be employed as catapults, they were generally constructed for hurling\r\nheavy projectiles, by causing these to describe a curved line, like\r\nmodern shells; and their shape is, in fact, much more like that of our\r\nmortars than of cannon (Fig. 63).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--Bombards on fixed and rolling carriages. (From\r\nthe MSS. 851 and 852, Bibl. Imp. de Paris.)]\r\n\r\n“It would seem,” says M. de Saulcy, “that, in loading them, hollow\r\ncylinders (_manchons_), or movable chambers, were used, in which the\r\ncharge was previously laid; and these fitted, by means of a wedge, into\r\nthe body of the piece. Sometimes these cylinders were at the side, and\r\nformed a right angle with the axis of the piece, but usually they fitted\r\ninto the breech, of which they formed a prolongation.”\r\n\r\nThe name _bombards_, which we have just used, and which is derived, as\r\nwe may conclude, from the Greek _bombos_ (noise), was the first employed\r\nfor designating cannon; but these engines were so imperfect in\r\nprinciple, and so feeble in power, that catapults, which had played so\r\nsignal a part in sieges during the Middle Ages, were used in preference\r\nwhen very heavy projectiles had to be hurled (Fig. 64).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.--Mangonneau; an Engine of War of the Fifteenth\r\nCentury. (Miniature in the MS. 7,239, Bibl. Imp. of Paris.)]\r\n\r\nOriginally the piece rested, as it were, fixedly on a massive support;\r\nbut soon the means of sighting had to be considered; thus we see\r\ndepicted in early manuscripts pieces that could be moved up and down by\r\nmeans of trunnions; or which were elevated or depressed for firing by a\r\nsort of tail or long projection behind the tube; at other times the\r\nmuzzle of the cannon is sustained by a fork more or less buried in the\r\nground. This bombard, attached to a platform on wheels, received the\r\ndenomination of _cerbotana ambulatoria_; this last word conveying the\r\nidea of the movability of the engine.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that projectiles were of stone, but there is no doubt that\r\nfrom the fourteenth century they were also made of metal; that was\r\nnothing new, for ancient engines of war, including the sling, threw\r\nleaden balls and masses of red-hot iron. No doubt it was with the object\r\nof giving the largest size possible to projectiles of artillery by means\r\nof powder that stone was used; which, in the state of the art at that\r\ntime, was much better adapted than metal for large balls.\r\n\r\nChristine of Pisa, who wrote in the time of Charles VI. the “Livre des\r\nFaits d’Armes et de Chevalrie,” has left us a collection of very\r\ninteresting details of the condition of artillery used with powder,\r\nwhich, as early as the fifteenth century, had become much more extended\r\nthan would be easily believed; moreover, in the descriptions this author\r\ngives of armaments, or of narratives of battles, we almost always still\r\nsee catapults, the large cross-bows, &c., appearing by the side of\r\ncannon; a certain proof that the use of powder found its equivalent in\r\nmore than one instance in the ancient means of the propulsion of\r\nprojectiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.--Earliest Models of Cannon. In the Tower of\r\nLondon.]\r\n\r\nValturio, an Italian writer, whose treatise on military art was first\r\nprinted in 1472, has described and drawn all the engines of war then in\r\nuse. Cannons are not forgotten. We observe that the greater number of\r\nthese pieces have no longer any box forming a movable chamber; this\r\nimplies an important advance in the art of making them; but, on the\r\nother hand, these cannons, bound with cords to a block of wood, or\r\nresting on platforms, must have been very difficult to move.\r\n\r\nAt this period pieces of the largest calibre, which projected enormous\r\nballs of stone, were more commonly called _bombards_; mortars, the very\r\nshort cannons throwing heated projectiles; cannons, pieces of medium\r\ncalibre carrying iron projectiles (Fig. 65); culverins, the long pieces\r\nloaded with leaden balls, which, as well as the powder, were rammed in\r\nwith an iron rod; hand-cannons, or _bâtons à feu_ (Fig. 66), were in a\r\nmanner portable, for if they were handled by one man, it was never\r\nwithout his having recourse to another for firing them.\r\n\r\nThis last-named term, _bâtons à feu_, like that of _cannon_, existed\r\nbefore the invention of gunpowder. As swords and lances had often been\r\ndesignated under the generic name of _bâtons_, it followed that the name\r\nwhich implied arms in general should also be applied to the earliest\r\nportable firearms. In ancient royal ordinances we even see the term\r\n_gros bâtons_ used to designate large pieces of artillery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--Hand Cannon (or _Bâton à feu_), taken from a\r\npiece of Tapestry belonging to the Church of Notre Dame de Nantilly,\r\nSaumur.]\r\n\r\nAccording to M. de Saulcy, the most important improvement ever made in\r\nartillery is certainly that which consisted in placing a gun with\r\ntrunnions on a carriage _à flasques_--upright beams of wood, between\r\nwhich the gun can oscillate, and united by cross-pieces; this carriage\r\nwas mounted on wheels, and admitted of the gun being inclined by the\r\nsimple use of a wedge of wood placed under the breech. But, strangely\r\nenough, it is most difficult to state precisely the date of this\r\nimprovement. Nevertheless, circumstances tend to the belief that it was\r\nbetween 1476 and 1494--that is, during the reigns of Louis XI. and of\r\nCharles VIII.--that they succeeded in making pieces of all calibres\r\ncarrying iron shot, and also in solidly fixing the trunnions, which not\r\nonly supported the weight, but also resisted the recoil of the cannon.\r\nThe carriages for these guns were mounted on wheels. From this period\r\nthe art of fortifying towns underwent a complete revolution, which\r\nsuddenly changed the whole system.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1494, Charles VIII. entered Italy to conquer the kingdom of\r\nNaples, the French artillery produced universal admiration. The Italians\r\nhad only iron guns, drawn by bullocks in rear of the army, and more for\r\nappearance than for use. After the first discharge it was some hours\r\nbefore the gun was ready for a second. The French had lighter cannon of\r\nbronze, drawn by horses, and moved with so much order that their\r\ntransport hardly delayed the march of the army; they planted their\r\nbatteries with incredible promptitude, considering the period, and the\r\nrounds were as quickly delivered as they were well aimed. Cotemporaneous\r\nItalian writers say that the French used almost exclusively iron shot,\r\nand that the guns, both of large and small calibre, were admirably\r\nbalanced on their carriages.\r\n\r\nYet no single specimen, or even a drawing, of this remarkable artillery\r\nhas been handed down to us. The Museum of Artillery does, indeed,\r\npossess one small piece, on which, between the trunnions and the breech,\r\nis this inscription:--“Presented by Charles VIII. to Bartemi, Lord of\r\nPins, captain of the bands of artillery, in 1490.” This cannon presents\r\nnothing remarkable in its construction, for we already recognise the\r\nform, one that has scarcely varied since then, and which, it seems, was\r\ndefinitely adopted under Louis XII. and Francis I. Of this period we\r\nstill have two magnificent bronze cannons. They were found at Algiers in\r\n1830; the porcupine, the salamander, and the fleur-de-lys that ornament\r\nthem, made their origin known.\r\n\r\nArtillery, which in the reign of Charles VIII. had become an important\r\narm, and had, besides, the prestige of success in Italy, became a\r\nsubject to which particular attention was given in succeeding reigns.\r\nBut, we again say, the true principles of manufacture and mounting were\r\nalready well ascertained, and only improvements in matters of detail\r\nremained to be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe Armoury Real of Madrid contains a curious _dragonneau_,[12] cast at\r\nLiège in 1503, which figured in the siege of Santander in 1511 (Fig.\r\n67). The carriage, consisting of a single piece of carved oak, is by its\r\ndelicacy and finish worthy of sustaining this masterpiece of\r\nbronze-work, which presents a double interest, first as regards art, and\r\nthen on account of the rapid advance already made in firearms; for this\r\n_dragonneau_ has a double barrel, and is loaded at the breech.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.--Double-barrelled Dragonneau. Armoury Real of\r\nMadrid.]\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at this point, let us again retrace our steps, in order\r\nto note, and rapidly follow from its origin, the progress of firearms.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of these used in the middle of the fourteenth century were\r\ncalled hand-cannon, and were merely formed of an iron tube pierced with\r\na vent, without stock or lock.\r\n\r\nA manuscript of that period represents a warrior who, standing on one of\r\nthose little movable towers then forming part of the siege _matériel_,\r\nis shooting a stone with a gun of this description. The piece is resting\r\non the parapet. By the side a sling is placed with its stone--a\r\ncircumstance which indicates the relative power of the hand-cannon, as\r\nno doubt each engine was to be used alternately. In another place is a\r\nhorseman holding a small gun with a prolongation; the muzzle is\r\nsupported by a prong fixed on the pommel of the saddle. Thus it was\r\nimpossible for him to take aim, and he applied the fire with his hand.\r\n\r\nA little later, to prevent the effect of the recoil, there was added\r\nbelow the barrel, a little short of the centre, a sort of hook, intended\r\nto serve the purpose of checking the piece. When fired, it was supported\r\non a fork or on a wall; hence the name of _arquebuse à croc_, which took\r\nthe place of that of _canon à main_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.--Arquebusier. Drawn and Engraved by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nThe _arquebuse à croc_ sometimes weighed from fifty to sixty pounds,\r\nmeasured from five to six feet in length, and in principle was chiefly\r\nadapted for firing from a wall; it was lightened a little that it might\r\nbe used by foot-soldiers, who, however, never fired it without a fixed\r\nor a movable rest.\r\n\r\nThe inconvenience of applying fire with the hand, which, moreover,\r\nprevented the right direction of the missile, was soon partially\r\nsuperseded by adapting to the barrel a stock to fire from the shoulder,\r\nand a lock for a match, called a _serpentin_, which had only to be let\r\ndown to ignite the powder at the touch-hole. This was the matchlock\r\narquebus still used by certain Eastern nations in our time, and which\r\nsecured victory to the Spaniards at the battle of Pavia.\r\n\r\nAlthough the matchlock arquebus, which was made lighter, and was then\r\ncalled _mousquet_, continued to be the usual arm of infantry until the\r\ntime of Louis XIII., many serious objections to the use of the\r\n_serpentin_ continued. It compelled the soldier always to have a lighted\r\nmatch, or some means of striking a light. Besides, for nearly each shot\r\nit was necessary so to regulate the match that the end of it, which was\r\nplaced in the head of the _serpentin_ (lock), should come exactly into\r\nthe priming-pan; then the priming-pan had to be opened; these operations\r\nwere, so to speak, impossible for mounted men, who at the same time had\r\nto manage their horses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.--Arquebus with Wheel and Match.]\r\n\r\nAbout 1517 the Germans invented the screw-plate called _à\r\nrouet_,--wheel-lock (Fig. 69).\r\n\r\nTo the Spaniards is due the merit of the improvement that followed, the\r\ntype of which is still in a measure perpetuated in our percussion guns;\r\nwhich, in their turn, have just been replaced by the needle-gun. The\r\nSpanish screw-plate, often called the _miquelet_ screw-plate, had on the\r\noutside a spring, which pressed, at the extremity of its movable limb,\r\non one of the catches of the hammer; when the gun was cocked the other\r\ncatch pressed against a pin which projected from the inside and\r\ntraversed the screw-plate; this pin could be removed, and then the\r\nspring acted on the hammer, which was no longer held back; the flint\r\n(for at that time a flint was fitted to the gun) struck upon a ribbed\r\nplate of steel forming part of the cover of the priming-pan, the action\r\nof the flint on the plate produced the fire.\r\n\r\nAmong the arms in use during the sixteenth century was one called\r\n_petrinal_ or _poitrinal_ (petronel), on account of the bent stock,\r\nwhich rested on the chest. This short and heavy arquebus, which could\r\nonly throw balls, but of a very large size, to a short distance, was\r\nusually suspended from the shoulder by a strap or a broad cross-belt.\r\n\r\nLight troops were armed with these guns, and took the name of\r\n_carabins_; from this the weapon was next called _carabine_--a\r\ndesignation which since then has received quite another meaning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.--Battle-axe and Pistol of the 16th Century.\r\n(Museum of Artillery, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nThen followed the _pistoles_ and the _pistolets_, thus named, it is\r\nsaid, because they were invented at Pistoia; but, with other\r\netymologists, we can also believe that they owed the name to the fact of\r\ntheir bore being of equal diameter with that of the _pistole_, a coin of\r\nthe time. The earliest pistols were made with wheels (_à rouet_), and\r\nthe barrel did not measure more than a foot in length. Subsequently they\r\nvaried in shape and in use; some were made which fired several shots in\r\nsuccession, and in other cases they attempted to combine a pistol with\r\nthe dagger or the battle-axe. (Fig. 70, &c.) This is a notably fine\r\nspecimen.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget to note, in what may be called _les armes de luxe_,\r\nthe joint application of the match-holder and the wheel to\r\nhighly-finished arms, this combination being available.\r\n\r\nThe screw-plate _à miquelet_, improved by French experiments, led to the\r\nmechanism called flint-lock (_fusil_). There were also then pistols and\r\narquebuses with flint-locks, as formerly there had been pistols and\r\narquebuses with wheels. Subsequently the explanatory became the absolute\r\nterm, and the entire weapon was known as _fusil_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.--Banner of the Sword-cutlers of Angers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARRIAGES AND SADDLERY.\r\n\r\n     Horsemanship among the Ancients.--The Riding-horse and the\r\n     Carriage-horse.--Chariots armed with Scythes.--Vehicles of the\r\n     Romans, the Gauls, and the Franks: the Carruca, the Petoritum, the\r\n     Cisium, the Plaustrum, the Basterna, the Carpentum.--Different\r\n     kinds of Saddle-horses in the Days of Chivalry.--The Spur a\r\n     distinctive Sign of Nobility: its Origin.--The Saddle, its Origin\r\n     and its Modifications.--The Tilter.--Carriages.--The Mules of\r\n     Magistrates.--Corporations of Saddlers and Harness-makers,\r\n     Lorimers, Coachmakers, Chapuiseurs, Blazonniers, and\r\n     Saddle-coverers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE horse has been described by Buffon as “the noblest conquest made by\r\nman.” Historians, both, sacred and profane, inform us that the conquest\r\ndates from the most remote ages. In the Book of Job we have this\r\nmagnificent description:--“Then the Lord said, Hast thou given the horse\r\nstrength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? Canst thou make him\r\nafraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible. He\r\npaweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet\r\nthe armed men. He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither\r\nturneth he back from the sword. The quiver rattleth against him, the\r\nglittering spear and the shield. He swalloweth the ground with\r\nfierceness and rage; neither believeth he that it is the sound of the\r\ntrumpet. He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle\r\nafar off.” The sacred writer is here referring expressly to the fiery\r\nanimal trained for war, and obedient to the master who has trained him.\r\n\r\nXenophon, in his “Treatise on Horsemanship” and his “Instructor of\r\nCavalry,” and Diodorus in his “Histories,” are among the Greeks who\r\nadduce the most numerous testimonies to the honour in which equestrian\r\nexercises were held. Among the Latins, Virgil, in reference to the\r\nfunereal games celebrated by Acestes in honour of Anchises, tells us\r\nthat the Roman youth were taught equestrian art as practised by the\r\nTrojans. The horse and chariot races, which took place at the solemn\r\ngames in Greece, have always been justly celebrated; as were those which\r\ncontinued in Rome and in all the great cities of the Roman world until\r\nthe fifth or sixth century.\r\n\r\nWe are disposed to believe that the use of the saddle-horse and the\r\ncarriage-horse was introduced about the same time. But it seems that\r\nchariots were rarely mounted by any but chiefs, who fought from that\r\nambulatory elevation while squires managed the horses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.--The Carruca, or Pleasure-Carriage, drawn by a\r\nPair of Horses, dating from the Fifth to the Tenth Century. (Taken from\r\na MS. of the Ninth Century, in the Royal Library at Brussels.)]\r\n\r\nTo Cyrus the Great is ascribed the first idea of arming chariots with\r\nscythes, which cut to pieces in every direction those who opposed the\r\nprogress of the vehicle, or who were thrown down by the violence of the\r\nshock. The same war-carriages were found among the Gauls; for a king\r\nnamed Bituitus, having been taken prisoner by the Romans, appeared in\r\nhis chariot armed with scythes in the triumphal procession of the\r\ngeneral who had conquered him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.--Cart drawn by Oxen, end of the Fifteenth\r\nCentury. (Taken from the “Chroniques de Hainault,” MS. in the Royal\r\nLibrary at Brussels.)]\r\n\r\nRiding on horseback was not only practised, but was carried to the\r\nhighest degree of perfection, among the nations of antiquity; and the\r\nuse of chariots was, in former times, almost general in war and on\r\ncertain state occasions. The Romans, and in imitation of them the Gauls\r\nwho prided themselves on being skilful carriage-builders, had several\r\nsorts of wheeled vehicles. Those adopted by the Romans and the Gauls,\r\nbut discountenanced by the Franks, who preferred to ride on horseback,\r\nwere the _carruca_, or _carruque_, with two wheels and a pair of horses\r\n(Fig. 72), richly ornamented with gold, silver, and ivory; the\r\n_pilentum_, a four-wheel carriage with a cloth canopy; the _petoritum_,\r\nan open carriage suitable for rapid travelling; the _cisium_, a\r\nbasket-carriage drawn by mules, and used for long journeys; and finally,\r\nvarious carts--the _plaustrum_, the _serracum_, the _benne_, the\r\n_camuli_ (trucks), &c. These last, which were chiefly employed as\r\nfield-carts, continued in use even after pleasure-carriages had entirely\r\ndisappeared. There remained, however, independent of mule-litters, the\r\n_basterna_ and _carpentum_, state-carriages of the Merovingian period,\r\nbut only queens and ladies of high rank, who were unequal to long\r\njourneys on horseback, indulged in such means of locomotion, while\r\nmen--even kings and high personages--would have blushed to be conveyed\r\nlike “holy relics,” as picturesquely expressed by one of Charlemagne’s\r\ncourtiers; but certainly not at the period of the “lazy kings,” when, as\r\nBoileau has well said,--\r\n\r\n   “In Paris, four oxen, in pace soft and slow,\r\n    Drew the indolent monarch, when airing he’d go.”\r\n\r\n“Chivalry,” wrote M. le Marquis de Varenne, “the exercises of which were\r\nthe image of war, rendered horsemanship a new art always indispensable\r\nin the education of the nobility; and _chevalier_ soon became synonymous\r\nwith a man of good birth.” “The Book of Facts,” by the “Bon Chevalier\r\nMessire Jean le Maingre, called _Baucicaut_, Marshal of France,” written\r\nin the beginning of the fifteenth century, enumerates the exercises\r\nwhich a youth aspiring to the title of a gentleman had to\r\nundergo:--“They endeavoured to leap (_sailler_) upon a charger, fully\r\narmed; _item_, leaped, without placing the foot in the stirrup, on a\r\ncharger in all its armour; _item_, leaped from the ground a-straddle on\r\nto the shoulders of a tall man on a large horse, seizing the man by the\r\nsleeve with one hand, without other assistance; _item_, placing one hand\r\non the saddle-bow of a large charger, and the other near the ears,\r\ntaking him by the mane, and from the level ground jumping to the other\r\nside (_côté_) of the charger.”\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier Bayard, while yet page to the Duke of Savoy, and only\r\nseventeen years of age, performed, as his historian relates, wonders in\r\nthe meadows of Ainay, at Lyons, before King Charles VIII., “in leaping\r\non his charger,” and by his management of it creating a favourable\r\nimpression of his merits. This will suffice to show the estimation in\r\nwhich horsemanship was held. No one was regarded as a valiant knight\r\nuntil he had proved his prowess in jousts and tournaments (Fig. 74) in\r\nthe rank of squire. Although his functions were essentially those of\r\nserving, a squire, who ranked higher than a page, was to the knight\r\nrather an auxiliary and a companion than a servant. It was his duty to\r\ncarry the arms of the knight, to take charge of his table, his house,\r\nand his horses. On the field of battle he remained in his rear, ready to\r\ndefend him, to lift him up if he were overthrown, and to provide him,\r\nwhen necessary, with another horse or other arms. He guarded the\r\nprisoners captured by the knight, and occasionally fought for him at his\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe principal sign distinguishing knights from squires consisted in the\r\nmaterial of which their spurs were made--of gold for the former, of\r\nsilver for the latter. It is well known that, at the disastrous battle\r\nof Courtray, the Flemings collected after the action, from the slain,\r\nfour thousand pairs of gold spurs; consequently, four thousand knights\r\nof the army of Philip the Fair had fallen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.--A Knight entering the Lists. (From a Miniature\r\nin the “Tournois du Roi René.”)]\r\n\r\nIn order to _win his spurs_ (of gold)--an expression become\r\nproverbial--it was indispensable that one who aspired to the honour\r\nshould perform some valiant deed, proving him worthy of being “dubbed,”\r\nor armed as a knight. The ceremony of admission commenced by presenting\r\nthe spurs; and whosoever conferred the order of chivalry, were he king\r\nor prince, condescended to put on and fasten the spurs for the\r\nrecipient. In pursuance of the same principle, when a knight, having\r\ncommitted a fault or any cowardly act, had incurred blame or correction,\r\nit was by deprivation of, or by changing his spurs, that his degradation\r\ncommenced. For a slight offence a herald substituted silver spurs for\r\nthose of gold, which lowered a knight to the grade of squire. But in a\r\ncase of “forfeiture,” as it was termed, an executioner or a cook cut off\r\nthe straps of his spurs, or they were struck off on a dunghill with an\r\naxe: infamy was the future portion of him who had been subjected to that\r\npublic disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of wearing spurs was regarded as a mark of independence\r\nand authority; so that when a noble tendered faith and homage to his\r\nsovereign, he was obliged to take off his spurs in token of vassalage.\r\nIn 816, ere chivalry had been instituted, an assembly of lords and\r\nbishops prohibited ecclesiastics from adopting the profane fashion of\r\nwearing spurs then prevailing among the higher classes of the clergy.\r\n\r\nThe use of the spur appears to date from the most ancient times. The\r\norigin of the word has been much disputed. From the time of Louis le\r\nDébonnaire it was called _spuors_, which has become _sporen_ in Germany,\r\n_sperane_ in Italian, _spur_ in English, _éperon_ in French. The Latins\r\ncalled it _calcar_ (which originally signified cock’s spur), doubtless\r\nfrom the form first given to the spur. That form has strangely varied\r\nduring centuries. The oldest known shape is that of the spur found in\r\nthe tomb of Queen Brunehaut, who died in 613, and which is simply like a\r\nskewer. This seems to have long continued to be the form; but, from the\r\ncommencement of the thirteenth to the end of the sixteenth century, the\r\nspur is seen in the form of a rose, or of a star with a turning rowel,\r\nand was mostly fashioned in a very rich and delicate manner. At the\r\nperiod when horses were clad in steel or leather, the spurs were\r\nnecessarily very long, in order to reach the animal’s flanks (Figs. 75\r\nand 76). The spurs of Godfrey of Bouillon, which have been preserved\r\n(their authenticity is more or less questionable), are in that style. In\r\nthe reign of Charles VII. the young nobles wore, rather for show than\r\nfor use, spurs the rowel of which was as large as the hand, and fixed at\r\nthe end of a metal stem half a foot long.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, from time immemorial every mounted horse “felt the spur,”\r\nthere was at least a period when every sort of spur could not be\r\nindiscriminately applied to the flanks of each individual of the equine\r\nrace. “There are,” says Brunetto Latini, a writer of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, in his “Treasury of all Things”--a sort of encyclopædia of the\r\nage--“there are horses of several kinds: chargers, or tall horses, for\r\nthe combat, whence the expression, ‘mounting the high horse;’ others,\r\nfor gentle exercise, use palfreys, which were also called amblers and\r\nhackneys; others employ pack-horses, _courtants_ (cropped horses), to\r\ncarry a load (_somme_).” _Somme_ here signifies a burden, and this,\r\nwhich we now call baggage, consisted of spare arms and hauberk, which a\r\nknight was careful to take with him when he went to the wars. Mares and\r\n_bât_-horses (horses carrying the _bât_, or load) were reserved for\r\nagriculture and other field-purposes; and it was clearly on that account\r\nthat a knight was not allowed to ride them. To make a knight ride upon a\r\nmare was, like the loss of his spurs, one of the most degrading\r\npunishments that could be inflicted on him, and thenceforth “any one who\r\nregarded his own honour would no more have touched that disgraced knight\r\nthan a shaven idiot (leper).”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.--German Spur.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.--Italian Spur.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.--A Knight armed and mounted for War. (Museum of\r\nArtillery, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nThe horses of French knights were without ears or mane; those of the\r\nGermans without tails. According to Carrion-Nisas, the armour of the\r\nhorse, and the style in which it was caparisoned, were the cause of\r\nthese mutilations. We have elsewhere remarked that if the men were cased\r\nin steel their horses were not less heavily cuirassed (Fig. 77). The\r\nentire armour and appointments of a horse were called the harness; the\r\nplates of steel or leather (for leather also was often used) were called\r\n_bardes_. We find enumerated, not only the articles of which the harness\r\nconsisted--_chanfrein_, _nasal_, _flancois_, &c.--but examples are cited\r\nto denote the sumptuousness of this equipment of the horse. We need not,\r\nhowever, dwell longer here on this subject, that refers more properly to\r\nthe manufacture of arms; but a few words must be said regarding the\r\nsaddle, which is, if we may use the expression, an implement of\r\nhorsemanship, and not a part of the armour.\r\n\r\nThe use of saddles seems to have been unknown in early times, and never\r\nto have been introduced among certain nations which, by the way, were\r\nmost famous in the art of training the horse and making him serviceable.\r\nThe Thessalonians and the Numidians rode on the bare back, without\r\nsaddle or stirrups; seated firmly on the horse simply by the pressure of\r\nthe knees and the calf of the legs; a position which is still that of\r\nthe boldest riders in the East and in Africa. Hippocrates has ascribed\r\nthe common and severe diseases of the hips and legs which afflicted the\r\nScythians to the rider’s want of support on horseback. Galen makes the\r\nsame remark regarding the Roman legions, who only introduced the use of\r\na saddle about the year 340 of the Christian era. The Gauls and Franks\r\nused neither saddles nor stirrups; but when steel armour was adopted, it\r\nwould have been impossible for knights to preserve an equilibrium\r\nwithout the aid of a saddle, or to sustain the slightest shock to which\r\nthey were exposed, as armour rendered them in a manner rigid, or with\r\nlittle flexibility on their large horses.\r\n\r\nThey therefore had recourse to a high, or rather a deep, saddle, closely\r\nadhering to the thighs and loins, with large stirrups serving as\r\nsupports to the feet. The several parts of the armour being splendidly\r\nornamented, it followed that the saddles, which also were exposed to\r\nview, were no more neglected than other ornaments of the animal.\r\nEngraved and chased, they were also gilt and painted, and thus, with the\r\nshield, helped to distinguish, by the “devices” they bore, the armed\r\nwarrior completely cased in his steel covering (Figs. 78 to 81).\r\n\r\nAs to stirrups, of which there certainly is no trace among the Greeks or\r\nthe Romans, it may be said they were coeval with the invention of\r\nsaddles. They made their appearance in the earliest days of the\r\nMerovingian dynasty; and if we accept the German etymology which the\r\nlearned have offered (_streben_, to support one’s self), the name and\r\nthe object was introduced by the Franks into Gaul. However that may be,\r\nthey were no longer dispensed with, especially in war, and when the\r\nweight of armour rendered their use necessary. They were of course very\r\nlarge, very massive, and very clumsy in the days of chivalry. When they\r\ndiminished in size and weight they were wrought with more care, and\r\nbecame objects of art, charged with ingenious ornaments, and embellished\r\nwith engraving, chasing, and gilding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 78 and 79.--Tournament Saddles, ornamented with\r\nPaintings, taken from the Armoury Real, Madrid. Sixteenth Century.\r\n(Communicated by M. Ach. Jubinal.)]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the opinion held by M. de la Varenne, we have already\r\nascribed the disuse of private carriages to the contempt with which the\r\nFranks regarded a mode of conveyance deemed by them to be effeminate.\r\nBut, following the same author, we must observe that a reason might\r\nalso be discovered in the wretched condition into which, after the\r\ndecline of the Romans, those magnificent roads formed by them in all\r\ntheir conquered provinces had fallen. In towns, moreover, the streets,\r\nnarrow, crooked, and with no regular direction, were very frequently so\r\nmany holes and quagmires. Philip Augustus I. had some of the streets of\r\nParis paved in that _lutèce_[13] which already, at the time of the Roman\r\nconquest, had deserved the significant epithet of _miry_. The princes\r\nand the nobles who, as Molière humorously makes Mascarilla say, feared\r\n“to leave the impression of their shoes in mud,” and could not without\r\ndifficulty drive about the towns in carriages, consequently had recourse\r\nto the horse or the mule. The ladies made use of them also; but very\r\nfrequently, if not carried in litters, they rode on a pillion behind the\r\nhorseman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.--The Caparison of the Horse of Isabel the\r\nCatholic. (Communicated by M. Ach. Jubinal.)]\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century chariots reappeared; but the fashion did not\r\nlong prevail, for Philip the Fair discouraged them, in one of the\r\nclauses of his sumptuary ordinance of 1294, by declaring that “no\r\ncitizen may have a chariot.”\r\n\r\nThe litter continued to be held in repute for processions; but queens\r\nfrequently rode on horseback. Isabel of Bavaria rode on a beautiful\r\npalfrey, with her ladies and her maids also on horseback, on the\r\noccasion of her entering Paris to espouse Charles VI. And when Mary of\r\nEngland, who went to be married to Louis XII., made her entry into\r\nAbbeville, she also, as Robert de la Marck relates, was mounted on a\r\npalfrey, as were most of her ladies, “and the remainder in chariots; and\r\nthe king, riding a large, prancing bay horse, came to receive his bride,\r\nwith all the gentlemen of his household and of his guard on horseback.”\r\nThe meeting of Henry VIII. and Francis I. in the camp of the Field of\r\nthe Cloth of Gold, presented the most beautiful display that had ever\r\nbeen seen of caparisoned horses, decorated and furnished with\r\nunprecedented richness (Fig. 82).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.--Saddle-cloth. Sixteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nCharles V., in consequence of frequent attacks of gout, was soon\r\ncompelled to renounce riding. When he went into the country, or on a\r\njourney, he was generally followed by a litter and a chair. Mules bore\r\nthe litter, in which he could recline, while bearers carried the chair,\r\nwhich was\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE OF THE QUEEN ISABEAU OF BAVARIA INTO PARIS.\r\n\r\nFrom a Miniature in Froissart’s Chronicles, National Library, Paris.]\r\n\r\nprovided with a movable back; its four uprights could be fitted with a\r\nsort of canopy of canvas or leather.\r\n\r\nIn 1457 the ambassadors of Ladislaus V., King of Hungary, presented to\r\nMarie of Anjou, Queen of France, a chariot which excited the admiration\r\nof the whole court and the inhabitants of Paris, “because,” as the\r\nhistorian of the times says, “it was _branlant_ (suspended), and very\r\nrich.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.--Henry VIII. in the Camp of the Field of the\r\nCloth of Gold (1520). From the Bas-reliefs of the Hôtel of the Bourg\r\nHerolde at Rouen.]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to reconcile the inference to be drawn from the\r\nordinance of Philip the Fair with the assertion of many historians, that\r\ncoaches first appeared in France only in the time of Francis I. The\r\npoint is still doubtful. Nevertheless, one may suppose historians to\r\nmean that coaches, instead of being the only vehicles employed in Paris\r\nin the time of Francis I., were but chariots of a grander and more\r\ngorgeous description than any seen before that time. But we know for\r\ncertain that, during the Middle Ages, the horse and the mule were\r\ngenerally ridden by everybody, by citizens and by nobles, by women and\r\nby men. The horse-blocks fixed in the streets--too narrow evidently, if\r\nnot for one carriage, at least for two to pass each other--and the rings\r\nfastened on doors sufficiently denote that it was so. The mule was\r\nespecially ridden by sedate men, such as magistrates and doctors, who\r\nhad to “amble” through the towns. “To take care of the mule,” a\r\nproverbial expression signifying to wait impatiently, is derived from\r\nthe custom of lawyers’ servants remaining in the court of the Palace to\r\ntake charge of the riding-horses or mules belonging to their masters.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sauval, the two first coaches seen in Paris, and which\r\ncalled forth the wonder of the people, belonged, one to Queen Claude,\r\nthe first wife of Francis I.; and the other to Diana of Poitiers, his\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.--Sedan-chair of Charles V. (Armoury Real,\r\nMadrid.)]\r\n\r\nThe fashion was soon followed; so much so, that even where the sumptuary\r\nlaws were still regarded as efficient, we find parliament entreating\r\nCharles IX. to prohibit the circulation of coaches (_coches_) through\r\nthe town. The magistrates continued, until the commencement of the\r\nseventeenth century, to attend at the courts of justice on their mules.\r\nChristopher of Thou, father of the celebrated historian, and first\r\nPresident of Parliament, was the first who came thither in his carriage;\r\nbut only because he suffered from gout, for his wife continued to ride\r\non horseback, seated pillion-fashion behind a servant.\r\n\r\nHenry IV. had only one carriage. “I shall be unable to go and see you,”\r\nhe one day wrote to Sully, “for my wife uses my coach (_coche_).” These\r\ncoaches were neither elegant nor convenient. For doors they were\r\nprovided with leathern aprons, which were drawn or opened for entrance\r\nor exit, with similar curtains to protect against the rain or the sun.\r\n\r\nMarshal Bassompierre, in the time of Louis XIII., had a glass coach made\r\nfor him, which was regarded as a real marvel: it originated the impulse\r\nwhich has led to the productive era of modern coach-building.\r\n\r\nFormerly there were in Paris, as appears from numerous documents,\r\nseveral corporations representing the saddler’s trade. First came the\r\n_selliers-bourreliers_, and the _selliers-lormiers-carrossiers_. The\r\nprivileges of the first secured to them specially the manufacture of\r\nsaddles and harness (collars and other articles for draught). The second\r\nmade also carriages, bridles, reins, &c. Another very ancient\r\ncorporation was that of the _lormiers-éperonniers_--“artisans,” says the\r\nGlossary of Jean de Garlande, “whom the military nobles greatly\r\npatronised, because they manufactured silvered and gilt spurs, metal\r\nbreastplates for their horses, and well-executed bits.” There were also\r\n_chapuissiers_, who made saddle-bows and pack-frames for the beasts of\r\nburden, which were mostly manufactured of alder-wood.\r\n\r\nThe _blazenniers_ and _cuireurs_ then covered with leather the packs and\r\nthe saddles prepared by the _chapuissiers_; and, finally,\r\nsaddle-painters were employed to ornament them, either in compliance\r\nwith fashion, which has always been omnipotent in France, or according\r\nto the laws of heraldry, when intended for men of rank for purposes of\r\nstate or war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.--Banner of the Corporation of the Saddlers of\r\nTonnerre.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLD AND SILVER WORK.\r\n\r\n     Its Antiquity.--The Trésor de Guarrazar.--The Merovingian and\r\n     Carlovingian Periods.--Ecclesiastical Jewellery.--Pre-eminence of\r\n     the Byzantine Goldsmiths.--Progress of the Art consequent on the\r\n     Crusades.--The Gold and Enamels of Limoges.--Jewellery ceases to be\r\n     restricted to Purposes of Religion.--Transparent Enamels.--Jean of\r\n     Pisa, Agnolo of Sienna, Ghiberti.--Great Painters and Sculptors\r\n     from the Goldsmiths’ Workshops.--Benvenuto Cellini.--The Goldsmiths\r\n     of Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the remarks upon furniture, we were compelled to trespass on the\r\ndomain which we now again approach; for, having to trace the history of\r\nsecular and religious luxury, we cannot but frequently encounter the\r\ngoldsmiths and their splendid works. It will thus happen more than once\r\nthat we shall have to indicate briefly certain important facts already\r\ndescribed, in some details, in preceding chapters.\r\n\r\nIt is known that in old times, even the most remote, the goldsmith’s art\r\nflourished. There is scarcely any ancient narrative which does not\r\nallude to jewels; and every day the discovery of precious objects, found\r\nin ruins and in tombs, still attests the high state of perfection the\r\nart of gold and silver work had attained among races long since extinct.\r\n\r\nThe Gauls, when under Roman dominion, applied themselves successfully to\r\nthe business of the gold-worker. We may again say that the triumph of\r\nthe Christian religion, under Constantine the Great, while encouraging\r\nthe interior decoration of places of worship, added a fresh impulse to\r\nthe development of this beautiful art.\r\n\r\nThe popes succeeding St. Sylvester (who had stimulated the liberality of\r\nConstantine) continued to accumulate, in the churches at Rome, the most\r\ncostly and massive articles of gold-work. Symmachus (498 to 514) alone,\r\naccording to a calculation made by Seroux d’Agincourt, enriched the\r\ntreasures of the basilicas to the amount of 130 pounds weight of gold,\r\nand 1,700 of silver, forming the material of objects most finely\r\nwrought. It was from the very court of the Greek emperors that the\r\nexamples of this magnificence were derived; for we hear St. John\r\nChrysostom exclaiming, “All our admiration is at present reserved for\r\nthe goldsmiths and the weavers;” and it is well known that in\r\nconsequence of his bold indiscretion in rebuking the extravagance of the\r\nEmpress Eudoxia, this eloquent Father of the Church expiated in exile\r\nand persecutions his ardent zeal and his sincerity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.--Gallic Bracelet, from a Cabinet of Antiquities.\r\n(Imp. Library, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nThe brilliant specimens of the gold-work of the Visigoths, which, in\r\n1858, were exhumed in the field of Guarrazar, near Toledo, and which\r\nhave been obtained for the Cluny Museum, throw a new light on the\r\nmonuments of that period. Far from indicating any original style, they\r\nafford further proof that the barbarians who came from the North became\r\nsubjected, in the arts, to Byzantine influence. The most remarkable, not\r\nonly in its dimensions and extreme richness, but in the peculiarity of\r\nits ornaments, is a votive crown, intended to be hung, according to the\r\ncustom of those times, in a sacred place--that of Recesvinthe, who\r\nreigned over the Goths of Spain from 653 to 672. It is composed of a\r\nlarge fillet, jointed, and formed of a double plate of the finest gold.\r\nThirty uncut sapphires and as many pearls, regularly alternating,\r\narranged in three rows and in quincunxes,[14] are seen on its exterior\r\ncircle. Chased ornaments occupy the spaces between the stones. The\r\nvotive crown of King Suintila, which we here reproduce (Fig. 86), is\r\nfully as rich, and about thirty years older.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD CROSSES OF A KING OF THE GOTHS.\r\n\r\nFound at Guarrazar. Seventh Century. (Museum of the Hotel Cluny) (Taken\r\nfrom the work of M. Ferdinand de Lasteyrie.)]\r\n\r\nIt is of massive gold, ornamented with sapphires and pearls arranged in\r\nrose-pattern, and set off by two borders similarly set with delicate\r\nstones. But the originality of this precious gem consists in the letters\r\nhanging as pendants from its lower border. These letters, open-worked,\r\nare filled with small pieces of red glass set in gold; their combination\r\npresents the following inscription:--“_Suintilanus Rex offeret_”\r\n(offering of the King Suintila). Each of them is suspended from the\r\nfillet by a chain with double links, sustaining a pendant of violet\r\nsapphire, pear-shaped. Finally, the crown is suspended by four chains\r\nattached to a circular top of rock-crystal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.--Votive Crown of Suintila, King of the Visigoths\r\nfrom 621 to 631. (Armoury Real, Madrid.)]\r\n\r\n“Five of the crowns so fortunately discovered at Guarrazar,” says M. de\r\nLasteyrie, “have crosses. These, attached by a chain to the same\r\ncircular top, were evidently intended to remain suspended across the\r\ncircle of the crown.” The cross belonging to the crown of Recesvinthe is\r\nby far the richest; eight large pearls and six sapphires, all mounted in\r\nopen-work, adorn the front. The four other crosses are of the form which\r\nin heraldry is called _croix patée_; but they differ in size and in the\r\nornaments with which they are enriched.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that the kings and grandees of the Merovingian\r\nperiod displayed in their plate and in some of their state-furniture a\r\nrichness of gold-work the profuseness of which was ordinarily opposed to\r\ngood taste. We have seen at his work the celebrated Saint Eloi,\r\nbishop-goldsmith; and we have mentioned not only his remarkable\r\nproductions, but also the enduring influence he exercised over a whole\r\nhistorical period of art. Finally, we have observed that\r\nCharlemagne--whose object seems to have been not only to imitate\r\nConstantine, but to surpass him--endowed the churches magnificently with\r\nworks of art, without prejudice to the numberless splendours which his\r\npalaces contained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.--The Sword of Charlemagne. Preserved in the\r\nImperial Treasury at Vienna.]\r\n\r\nAccording to a tradition, the loss of most of the beautiful objects of\r\ngold-work belonging to that monarch may have been owing to the\r\ncircumstance that they were disposed around him in the sepulchral\r\nchamber where the body was deposited after death; and the emperors of\r\nGermany, his successors, may not have scrupled to appropriate those\r\nriches, of which some rare specimens, particularly his diadem and sword,\r\nare still preserved in the Museum of Vienna (Figs. 87 and 88).\r\n\r\nEcclesiastical display, notably extinct during the period of trouble and\r\nsuffering through which the Church passed in the seventh and eighth\r\ncenturies, and to which the power of Charlemagne was to put an end,\r\nmanifested itself in an extraordinary degree from that time. For\r\nexample, it was calculated that under Leo III., who occupied the\r\npontifical chair from 795 to 816, the weight of the plate which the Pope\r\ngave to enrich the churches, amounted to not less than 1,075 pounds of\r\ngold and 24,744 pounds of silver!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.--Diadem of Charlemagne. Preserved in the\r\nImperial Treasury at Vienna.]\r\n\r\nTo that period belongs the famous gold altar of the basilica of St.\r\nAmbrose of Milan, executed in 835, by order of Archbishop Angilbert, by\r\nVolvinius; and which, notwithstanding its immense intrinsic value, has\r\ncome down to our time. “The four sides of this monument,” says M.\r\nLabarte, “are of extreme richness. The front, entirely of gold, is\r\ndivided into three panels by a border of enamel. The centre panel\r\nrepresents a cross of four equal projections, formed by fillets of\r\nornaments in enamel, alternating with precious stones uncut but\r\npolished. Christ is seated in the centre of the cross. The symbols of\r\nthe Evangelists occupy its branches. Three of the Apostles are placed in\r\neach angle. All these figures are in relief. The right and left panels\r\ncontain each six bas-reliefs, the subjects of which are taken from the\r\nlife of Christ; they are encircled by borders of enamels and precious\r\nstones alternately disposed. The two sides, in silver relieved with\r\ngold, exhibit very rich crosses, treated in the same style as the\r\nborders. The back, which is also of silver relieved with gold, is\r\nlikewise divided in three large panels; that in the centre contains four\r\nmedallions, and each of the others six bas-reliefs, of which the life of\r\nSt. Ambrose supplied the subjects. In one of the medallions of the\r\ncentre panel is seen St. Ambrose receiving the gold altar from the hands\r\nof Archbishop Angilbert; in the other, St. Ambrose is giving his\r\nbenediction to Volvinius, the master goldsmith (_magister faber_), as he\r\nis designated in the inscription transmitting to us the name of the\r\nauthor of this work, of which no description can give an exact idea.”\r\n\r\nIt was not Italy alone which possessed skilful goldsmiths, and\r\nencouraged them. We have in particular, among other enlightened and\r\nactive supporters of ecclesiastical gold-work, a succession of the\r\nbishops of Auxerre, to whom must be added Hincmar, bishop of Rheims, who\r\ncaused a splendid shrine to be made for the relics of the illustrious\r\npatron of his church. It was cased in plates of silver, and statues of\r\ntwelve bishops adorned its borders.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding all its artistic magnificence, the jewellery of the\r\nWest could only appear to be the reflex of the wonders produced at the\r\nsame epoch by the goldsmiths of the East, or the Byzantines, to adopt a\r\nterm generally sanctioned.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious specimens of Byzantine art, preserved in Russia,\r\nis a gold reliquary lined with a plate of silver, in the centre of which\r\nis an embossed representation of the Crucifixion. Above the head, on a\r\ngilt nimbus, is an inscription in Greek, “Jesus Christ, King of Glory.”\r\nThis treasure, remarkable for its extreme finish, is covered with a\r\nmosaic of precious stones of different colours, in partitions of gold;\r\nthe cross being quartered in enamel, with silver filigree. At the back\r\nthe names of the archimandrite Nicolos are engraved. It is a work of the\r\ntenth century, and was found in the Iberian monastery on Mount Athos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.--Byzantine Reliquary, in Enamel, brought from\r\nMount Athos. Tenth Century. (Collection of M. Sebastianof.)]\r\n\r\nIf rare specimens only of jewellery have come down to us of a date prior\r\nto the eleventh century, this may be accounted for not merely by their\r\nintrinsic value having indicated them to the uncivilised as fit objects\r\nof plunder during the invasions which took place after the reign of\r\nCharlemagne, but also, as we have elsewhere remarked, by the\r\nre-introduction of church furniture, which was in some measure a\r\nnecessary result of renovated architecture. It was right to adapt the\r\nstyle of plate to that of the edifice it was to adorn. The forms which\r\nwere then employed for various objects of church-service showed the\r\ninfluence of the severe style derived from the original Byzantine type;\r\nthe latter, moreover, explained itself by the repute, especially in\r\nmetallurgy, enjoyed by the city of Constantine, to which the East\r\ngenerally had recourse when taking in hand any work of importance.\r\n\r\nThe _German_ school particularly would acquire a Byzantine character,\r\nowing to the marriage of the Emperor Otho II. with the Greek princess\r\nTheophania (972)--an alliance which naturally bound the two empires in\r\ncloser ties, and attracted a considerable number of artists and artisans\r\nto Germany from the East. Of the works of that period still in\r\nexistence, one of the most remarkable is the rich gold cover of the book\r\nof the Gospels, now in the Royal Library, Munich; on which are executed,\r\nin the embossed style, various bas-reliefs of great delicacy, and\r\ndesigned with the purity at that time distinguishing the Greek school.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.--Altar of Gold, presented to the ancient\r\nCathedral of Basle by the Emperor Henry II., now in the Cluny Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Henry II. was therefore welcomed (_bien-venu_), and, if one\r\nmay say so, well served by the condition of art in Germany, when,\r\nelevated to the throne in 1002, and inspired by ardent piety, he sought,\r\nby princely liberality to the churches, to surpass even Constantine and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.--Enamelled Shrine, in Limoges Work of the\r\nTwelfth Century. (Museum of Cluny.)]\r\n\r\nCharlemagne. It is to Henry that the Cathedral of Basle owes the\r\ndecorations of the altar, to which none can be compared for richness,\r\nexcept that of Milan; yet without recalling it by its style, which has\r\nlost every trace of the antique, and is a clearly-pronounced type of the\r\nart which the Middle Ages were to create as their own. It is right to\r\nmention also the crown of the sainted emperor, and that of his wife, now\r\npreserved in the Treasury of the King of Bavaria; both are in six\r\njointed parts, making a circle; the former bears figures of winged\r\nangels; the other, stalks with four leaves designed with correctness and\r\ngrace, and executed in a manner which evinces the greatest dexterity.\r\n“Moreover,” says M. Labarte, “the taste for jewellery was then generally\r\ndiffused throughout Germany; and many prelates followed the example set\r\nby the emperor. Willigis, the first Archbishop of Mayence, may be cited;\r\nhe endowed his church with a crucifix weighing 600 pounds, the several\r\nparts of which were adjusted with such art that each could be detached\r\nat the joints; and Bernward, Bishop of Hildesheim, who, like St. Eloi,\r\nwas himself a celebrated goldsmith, and to whom is ascribed a crucifix\r\nenriched with precious stones and filigrees, and two magnificent\r\ncandelabra, which still constitute a portion of the treasures of the\r\nchurch whereof he was the pastor.”\r\n\r\nAbout the same period--that is, in the early days of the eleventh\r\ncentury--a monk of Dreux, named Odorain, who had made himself famous in\r\nFrance by his works in precious metals, executed a large number of\r\nobjects for King Robert, intended for the churches the monarch had\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.--Shrine in Copper Gilt. (End of the Twelfth\r\nCentury.)]\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked in the preceding chapter, that the Crusades gave a\r\ngreat impulse to the goldsmith’s art in Europe, in consequence of the\r\ngreat demand for shrines and reliquaries intended for the reception of\r\nthe venerated remains of saints which the soldiers of the faith brought\r\nback from their distant expeditions (Figs. 91 and 92). The offerings of\r\nconsecrated vessels and of altar-fronts were also multiplied. The Holy\r\nScriptures received cases and coverings which were so many splendid\r\nworks entrusted to the goldsmiths. To speak truly, had it not been for\r\nthe essentially religious direction which, at that period, certain\r\ndepartments of luxury acquired by the Crusaders in the East had taken,\r\nwe might perhaps have seen the arts, that only in the West recommenced\r\na real existence, become extinguished, and in a manner perish in the\r\nfirst burst of their revival.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly to the minister of Louis le Gros, Suger, Abbot of\r\nSaint-Denis, who died in 1152, that the honour of this consecration of\r\narts is due, for he distinctively proclaimed himself their protector; he\r\nendeavoured to render legitimate their position in the State, by\r\nopposing their pious aims to the too exclusive censures of St. Bernard\r\nand his disciples.\r\n\r\nConjointly with the powerful abbot, there is deserving of special\r\nmention a simple monk, Theophilus, an eminent artist who wrote in Latin\r\na description of the Industrial Arts of his time (_Diversarum Artium\r\nSchedula_), and devoted seventy-nine chapters of his book to that of the\r\ngoldsmith. This valuable treatise shows us, in the most unmistakable\r\nmanner, that the goldsmiths of the twelfth century must have possessed a\r\ncomprehensiveness of knowledge and manipulation, the mere enumeration of\r\nwhich surprises us the more now that we see industry everywhere tending\r\nto an almost infinite division of labour. At that time the goldsmith was\r\nrequired to be at once modeller, sculptor, smelter, enameller,\r\njewel-mounter, and inlay-worker. He had to cast his own models in wax,\r\nas well as to labour with his hammer or embellish with his graver: he\r\nhad to make the chalice, the vases, and the pyx, for the metropolitan\r\nchurches, on which were lavished all the resources of art; and to\r\nproduce, by the ordinary process of punching, the open-work or the\r\ndesigns of copper intended to ornament the books of the poor (_libri\r\npauperum_), &c.\r\n\r\nThe treasury of the Abbey of Saint-Denis still possessed, at the time of\r\nthe Revolution, several _chefs-d’œuvre_ produced by the artists whose\r\nprocesses are described by Theophilus; especially the rich mounting of a\r\ncup of Oriental agate, bearing the name of Suger, which it is believed\r\nhe used for the service of mass; and the mounting of an ancient sardonyx\r\nvase, known as the cup of the Ptolemies, which Charles the Simple had\r\ngiven to the abbey. Having been deposited, in 1793, in the Cabinet of\r\nMedals, Paris, the mounting of the cup of the Ptolemies and the chalice\r\nof Suger remained there until they were stolen in 1804.\r\n\r\nAmong the examples of that period still existing, and which,\r\nconditionally, every one is permitted to inspect, we may distinguish,\r\nwith M. Labarte,--in addition to “the great crown of lights” suspended\r\nunder the cupola in the cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle, and the\r\nmagnificent shrine in which Frederick I. collected the bones of\r\nCharlemagne,--in the Museum of the Louvre, a vase of rock-crystal\r\nmounted in gold and embellished with gems, presented to Louis VII. by\r\nhis wife Eleanora; in the Cluny Museum, several candelabra; in the\r\nImperial Library in Paris, the covering of a Latin manuscript, numbered\r\n622; a cup of agate onyx (Fig. 93), bordered with a belt of precious\r\nstones raised on a groundwork of filigree; and the beautiful gold\r\nchalice of St. Remy (Fig. 94), which, after having appeared in the\r\nCabinet of Antiquities, was restored in 1861 to the treasury of the\r\nchurch of Notre-Dame, Rheims.\r\n\r\nSevere forms and an elevated style were the characteristics of the\r\njewelled works of the eleventh and twelfth centuries; and, for the\r\nprincipal elements of accessory embellishment, we most frequently see\r\npearls, precious stones, with enamelled divisions which, according to\r\nthe minute description of Theophilus, are only delicate mosaics whose\r\nvarious coloured segments are separated by plates of gold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.--A Drinking Cup, called Gondole, of Agate; from\r\nthe Treasury of the Abbey of Saint-Denis. (Cabinet of Antiquities, Imp.\r\nLibrary, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nIn the days of St. Louis, a period of active and generous piety, there\r\nwas (an assertion which may appear hazardous after what we have said of\r\nthe zeal of preceding centuries) a remarkable accession to the number\r\nand the splendour of the gifts and offerings of jewellery to the\r\nchurches. For instance, it was then that Bonnard, Parisian goldsmith,\r\nassisted by the ablest artisans, devoted two years to the manufacture of\r\nthe shrine of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.--Chalice, said to be of St. Remy. (Treasury of\r\nthe Cathedral of Rheims.)]\r\n\r\nSt. Geneviève, on which he expended one hundred and ninety-three marks\r\nof silver and seven and a half marks of gold; the mark weighing eight\r\nounces. The shrine, consecrated in 1212, was in the form of a little\r\nchurch, with statuettes and bas-reliefs enriched with precious stones.\r\nIt was deposited in the French mint in 1793; but the spoil realised only\r\ntwenty-three thousand eight hundred and thirty livres. Half a century\r\nearlier, the most celebrated German goldsmiths were engaged during\r\nseventeen years upon the famous reliquary in silver gilt, called the\r\n“Great Relics,” which the cathedral at Aix-la-Chapelle still possesses;\r\nit was fabricated from the gifts deposited in that space of time by the\r\nfaithful in the poors’-box of the porch; an edict of the Emperor\r\nBarbarossa having appropriated all the offerings to that object, “so\r\nlong as it remained unfinished.”\r\n\r\nMoreover, that period, which may be regarded as denoting the zenith of\r\nthe goldsmith’s art for sacred purposes, is also that wherein occurred\r\nthe important transition which was to introduce into domestic life the\r\nsame lavishness so long devoted only to objects applicable to\r\necclesiastical use. But, before entering upon that new phase, we ought\r\nto mention, not without much commendation, the enamelled gold-work of\r\nLimoges, which was greatly celebrated for several centuries. From the\r\nGallo-Romano period Limoges had acquired a reputation for the works of\r\nits goldsmiths. St. Eloi, the great goldsmith in the time of the\r\nMerovingian kings (Fig. 95), was originally from that country, and he\r\nwas working under Alban, a goldsmith, and master of the mint at Limoges,\r\nwhen his reputation led to his being called to the court of Clotaire II.\r\nThe ancient Roman colony had retained its industrial speciality, and\r\nduring the Middle Ages was remarkable for the production of works of a\r\npeculiar character, which are supposed to have been fabricated there\r\nprior to the third century, if we may judge from a passage in\r\nPhilostratus, a Greek writer of that period.\r\n\r\nThis work consisted of a mixed style, inasmuch as the material forming\r\nthe ground of the work is copper; and, moreover, the principal effects\r\nare due not less to the skill of the enameller than to the talent of the\r\nworker in metal. The process of fabrication is very simple--that is, in\r\nthe way of description--yet the execution must have been extremely\r\nprotracted and minute.\r\n\r\n“After having prepared and polished a plate of copper,” says M. Labarte,\r\nwhose account we transfer to our own pages, “the artist marked on it all\r\nthe parts which were to rise to the surface of the metal, in order to\r\nproduce the outlines of the drawing or of the figure he wanted to\r\nrepresent; then, with gravers and scrapers, he dug deeply in the copper\r\nall the space which the various metals were to cover. In the hollows\r\nthus _champlevés_ (a word sometimes used to signify the mode of\r\nproducing this kind of work), he placed the material to be vitrified,\r\nwhich was afterwards melted in a furnace. When the enamelled piece was\r\ncold, he polished it by various means, so as to bring to the surface of\r\nthe enamel all the lines of the drawing produced by the copper. Gilding\r\nwas afterwards applied to the parts\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.--Cross of an Altar, ascribed to St. Eloi.]\r\n\r\nof the metal thus preserved. Until the twelfth century, only the\r\noutlines of the drawing ordinarily rose to the surface of the enamel,\r\nand the tints of the flesh, as well as the dresses, were produced by\r\ncoloured enamel; in the thirteenth century enamel was no longer used but\r\nto colour the ground-work. The figures were entirely preserved on the\r\nplate of copper, and the outlines of the drawing were then shown by a\r\ndelicate engraving on the metal.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.--An Abbot’s Enamelled Crozier, made at Limoges.\r\n(Thirteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.--A Bishop’s Crozier, which appears to be of\r\nItalian manufacture. (Fourteenth Century. Cathedral of Metz.)]\r\n\r\nBetween the enamels partitioned (_cloisonnés_) and the enamels\r\n_champlevés_ the difference, as we can see, is only the first\r\narrangement of the divisions to receive the several vitrifiable\r\ncompositions. Making allowances for the influence of fashion, these two\r\nstyles of analogous works were held in almost equal estimation.\r\nNevertheless, it seems that the preference ought to be assigned to the\r\ngoldsmith’s art in Limoges, which, at a time when there was manifested a\r\ndemand for private reliquaries and collective offerings to the churches,\r\nhad this advantage over the other, that it was much less costly, and\r\nconsequently more accessible to all classes (Fig. 96). In the present\r\nday there is scarcely a museum, or even a private collection, that does\r\nnot contain some specimen of the ancient Limousine[15] industry.\r\n\r\nWith the fourteenth century the splendour of the goldsmith’s art ceases\r\nto display, as its exclusive object, ecclesiastical decoration and\r\nembellishment; but it suddenly became so developed among the laity that\r\nKing John (of France) desiring, or pretending to desire, to restore it\r\nto the exclusive line it had till then retained, prohibited by an\r\nordinance, in 1356, the goldsmiths from “_working_ (fabricating) gold or\r\nsilver plate, vases, or silver jewellery, of more than one mark of gold\r\nor silver, excepting for the churches.”\r\n\r\nBut it is possible to issue ordinances in order to show the advantage of\r\nevading them, and to benefit exclusively by the exception. This is what\r\nappears to have then occurred; for, in the inventory of the treasury of\r\nCharles V., son and successor of the king who signed the sumptuary edict\r\nof 1356, the value of the various objects of the goldsmith’s art is\r\nestimated at not less than nineteen millions. This document, in which\r\nthe greater number of the articles are described to the minutest detail,\r\nwould suffice in itself to exhibit a truthful historical view of the art\r\nat that period; and, at all events, it affords a striking idea of the\r\nartistic progress made in that direction, and of the extravagance to\r\nwhich the trade was subservient.\r\n\r\nWhen considering the subject of furniture in domestic life, we indicated\r\nthe names and the uses of several articles which were displayed on the\r\ntables or sideboards--plateholders, ewers, urns, goblets, &c.; we also\r\nadverted to the numerous and capricious forms they assumed--flowers,\r\nanimals, grotesque images; we need not, therefore, recur to the matter;\r\nbut we ought not to overlook the jewellery, of all sorts--insignia, or\r\nornaments of the head-dress, gems, clasps, chains and necklaces, antique\r\ncameos (Fig. 98), which appear in the treasury of the King of France.\r\n\r\nIn treating of ecclesiastical furniture we, moreover, observed that the\r\ngoldsmith’s art, although devoting itself to secular ornaments,\r\nnevertheless continued to work marvels in the production of objects for\r\necclesiastical use; it would be mere repetition to support this\r\nassertion by other examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.--An Ancient Cameo-setting of the time of Charles\r\nV. (Cab. of Ant., Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nBut, dismissing those two questions, let a contemporary poet raise a\r\nthird, which deserves a place here. Eustache Deschamps, who died in\r\n1422, equerry and usher-at-arms to Charles V. and Charles VI.,\r\nenumerates the jewels and gems which the female nobility of the time\r\naspired to possess. “It was indispensable,” he says--\r\n\r\n   “Aux matrones,\r\n    Nobles palais et riches trônes;\r\n    Et à celles qui se marient\r\n    Qui moult tôt (bientôt) leurs pensers varient,\r\n    Elles veulent tenir d’usaige ...\r\n    Vestements d’or, de draps de soye,\r\n    Couronne, chapel et courroye\r\n    De fin or, espingle d’argent ...\r\n    Puis couvrechiefs à or batus,\r\n    A pierres et perles dessus ...\r\n    Encor vois-je que leurs maris,\r\n    Quand ils reviennent de Paris,\r\n    De Reims, de Rouen et de Troyes,\r\n    Leur rapportent gants et courroyes ...\r\n    Tasses d’argent ou gobelets ...\r\n    Bourse de pierreries,\r\n    Coulteaux à imagineries,\r\n    Espingliers (étuis) taillés à émaux.”\r\n\r\nThey desired, moreover, and said that they ought to have given to them--\r\n\r\n   “Pigne (peigne) et miroir d’ivoire ...\r\n    Et l’estui qui soit noble et gent (riche et beau),\r\n    Pendu à chaines d’argent;\r\n    Heures (livres de piété) me fault de Notre-Dame,\r\n    Qui soient de soutil (delicat) ouvraige,\r\n    D’or et d’azur, riches et cointes (jolies),\r\n    Bien ordonnés et bien pointes (peintes),\r\n    De fin drap d’or très-bien couvertes,\r\n    Et quand elles seront ouvertes,\r\n    Deux fermaux (agrafes) d’or qui fermeront.”\r\n\r\nWe thus see that, according to the above programme, the jewel-box of a\r\nprincess, or of a lady of rank, must have been really splendid.\r\nUnfortunately for us, the specimens of these female ornaments of the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries are still more rare in collections\r\nthan objects of massive plate; and one is almost left to imagine their\r\nappearance and their richness from the entries in inventories, that\r\nchief source of information regarding the times of which the memorials\r\nhave disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt is there we see the costliness of the _fermails_, or clasps of cloaks\r\nand copes, called also _pectoraux_, because they fastened the garments\r\nacross the breast; girdles, chaplets (head-dresses), portable\r\nreliquaries, and other “little jewels (Fig. 99) _pendants et à pendre_,”\r\nthe fashion of which we have restored under the name of _breloques_, and\r\nwhich represent every variety of object more or less whimsical. We see,\r\nfor instance, gold clasps representing a peacock, a fleur-de-lis, two\r\nhands “clasped.” This one is embellished with six sapphires, sixty\r\npearls, and other large gems; that one with eighteen rubies, and four\r\nemeralds. From a girdle of Charles V., which is made “of scarlet silk\r\nadorned with eight gold mountings,” are suspended “a knife, scissors,\r\nand a pen-knife,” ornamented in gold; the trinkets (pendants) represent\r\n“a man on horseback, a cock holding a mirror in the form of a trefoil,”\r\nor “a stag of pearls with enamelled horns;” or, again, a man mounted on\r\na double-headed serpent, “playing on a Saracenic horn” (of Saracen\r\norigin). Finally, we remark that in reliquaries a fashion long\r\nestablished was maintained, which consisted of forming them of a\r\nstatuette representing a saint (Fig. 100), or of a subject that\r\ncomprised his image, and to which were attached, by a small chain,\r\nrelics inlaid in a little tabernacle of gold or silver, preciously\r\nwrought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.--Scent-box in Chased Gold. (A French Work of the\r\nFifteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nBut now the fifteenth century opens out, and with it a period of tumult.\r\nFrance suddenly beheld that impulse to industry paralyzed, which, to\r\nprosper, requires a condition of affairs very different from sanguinary\r\ncivil dissensions and foreign invasion. Not only were the workshops\r\nclosed, but princes and nobles were more than once constrained to\r\nappropriate the gorgeous decorations of their tables and their\r\ncollections of gems, to pay and arm warriors under their command, or\r\neven to redeem themselves from captivity.\r\n\r\nAt that time the goldsmith’s art flourished in the neighbouring country\r\nof Flanders, then quietly submissive to the powerful house of Burgundy,\r\nwhich, with equal taste and liberality, encouraged the art, which had\r\ninstalled itself in the principal cities. This was also an epoch of\r\nmagnificent productions\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.--Reliquary, Silver-gilt, surmounted by a\r\nStatuette of the Virgin with the Infant Jesus, representing Jeanne\r\nd’Evreux, Queen of France. (Museum of Sovereigns, in the Louvre.)]\r\n\r\nin that country, but not more than one or two examples remain; these are\r\nattributed to Corneille de Bonte, who worked at Ghent, and was\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.--The Ensign of the Collar of the Goldsmiths of\r\nGhent. (Fifteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\ngenerally considered the most skilful goldsmith of his time (Figs. 101\r\nand 102). However that may be, the style of the goldsmith’s art of the\r\nfifteenth century continued, as in the two or three preceding centuries,\r\nconformable to the contemporaneous style of architecture. For instance,\r\nthe shrine of Saint-Germain-des-Près, which was of that period, had the\r\nform of a small ogivale[16] church; and some specimens still existing in\r\nBerlin are of the Gothic character, the prevailing style of the edifices\r\nof those times. But an influence was making itself felt that was not\r\nlong in entirely modifying the general aspect of the productions of the\r\ntrade we are considering. That transformation must have been promoted by\r\nItaly; in the midst of which, in spite of intestine troubles and serious\r\ncontentions with other nations, a luxury and opulence prevailed. Genoa,\r\nVenice, Florence, Rome, had long been so many centres where the Fine\r\nArts struggled for pre-eminence and inspiration. Among the majority of\r\nthe wealthy merchants who had\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.--Escutcheon in Silver-gilt, executed by\r\nCorneille de Bonte, in the Fifteenth Century. (Museum of the Hôtel de\r\nVille, Ghent.)]\r\n\r\nbecome patricians of those gorgeous republics were found so many\r\nMæcenases, under whose patronage flourished great artists whom popes and\r\nprinces emulously countenanced. “From the moment,” says M. Labarte,\r\n“when the Nicolases, the Jeans of Pisa, and the Giottos, throwing off\r\nthe Byzantine yoke, caused Art to emerge from languor and supineness,\r\nthat of the goldsmith could no longer find favour in Italy but by\r\nmaintaining itself on a level with the progress of sculpture, whose\r\ndaughter it was.[17] When we know that the great Donatello,--Philip\r\nBrunelleschi, the bold architect of the dome of Florence,--Ghiberti, the\r\nauthor of the marvellous doors of the Baptistery, had goldsmiths for\r\ntheir earliest masters, we may judge what artists the Italian goldsmiths\r\nof that period must have been.” The first in date is the celebrated Jean\r\nof Pisa, son of Nicolas, who, brought from Arezzo in 1286, to sculpture\r\nthe marble table of the high-altar, and a group of the Virgin between\r\nSt. Gregory and St. Donato, desired to pay tribute to the taste of the\r\ntime by ornamenting the altar with those fine chasings on silver\r\ncoloured with enamels to which we give the name of translucid enamels in\r\nrelief; and also by designing a clasp or jewel with which he decorated\r\nthe breast of the Virgin. Both chasings and clasp are now lost.\r\n\r\nTo Jean (Giovanni) of Pisa succeeded his pupils Agostino and Agnolo of\r\nSiena.\r\n\r\nIn 1316 Andrea of Ognibene executed, for the Cathedral of Pistoia, an\r\naltar-front, which has come down to us, and must have been followed by\r\nmore important works. Then come Pietro and Paulo of Arezzo, Ugolino of\r\nSiena, and finally Master Cione,[18] the author of the two silver\r\nbas-reliefs still to be seen on the altar of the Baptistery of Florence.\r\nMaster Cione, whose school was numerous, had for his principal pupils\r\nForzane of Arezzo and Leonardo of Florence, who worked on the two most\r\nnoted monuments of the goldsmith’s art which time and depredations have\r\nrespected--the altar of Saint-Jacques at Pistoia, and that same altar of\r\nthe Baptistery to which the bas-reliefs of Cione were afterwards\r\nadapted. During more than a hundred and fifty years the ornamentation of\r\nthese two altars, of which no description can give an idea, was, if we\r\nmay so say, the arena wherein all the most famous goldsmiths met.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fourteenth century Luca della Robbia, who, as we have\r\nseen, distinguished himself in ceramic art, and afterwards Brunelleschi,\r\nno less great as an architect than as a sculptor, came forth from the\r\nstudio of a goldsmith. At the same period shone Baccioforte and Mazzano\r\nof Placentia, Arditi the Florentine, and Bartoluccio, master of the\r\nfamous sculptor Ghiberti, to whom we owe those doors of the Baptistery,\r\nwhich Michael Angelo pronounced worthy of being placed at the entrance\r\nto Paradise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103.--Shrine of the Fifteenth Century. (Collection\r\nof Prince Soltykoff.)]\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the execution of these doors was, in 1400,\r\nsubmitted to competition; and it may be said, in honour of the\r\ngoldsmith’s art, that Ghiberti, vying with the most celebrated\r\ncompetitors--for among them were Donatello and Brunelleschi--owed his\r\ntriumph, perhaps, to the simple fact that he had treated, as it were by\r\nhabit, his model with all the delicacy of the goldsmith’s art. And it\r\nmust be added, and to the praise of the great artist, that although in\r\ngreat reputation for sculptured works of the highest importance, he\r\nadhered faithfully all his life to his first profession, and considered\r\nit not derogatory even to manufacture jewellery. Thus, for example, in\r\n1428 he mounted as a signet for Jean de Medicis, a cornelian said to\r\nhave belonged to the treasury of Nero, and he set it as a winged-dragon\r\nemerging from a cluster of ivy leaves; in 1429, for Pope Martin V., a\r\nbutton of the cope, and a mitre; and in 1439, for Pope Eugene IV., a\r\ngolden mitre, embellished with five and a half pounds weight of precious\r\nstones,--its front representing Christ surrounded by numerous cherubs,\r\nand at the back the Virgin in the midst of the four Evangelists.\r\n\r\nDuring the forty years employed in the execution of the doors of the\r\nBaptistery, Ghiberti continued to derive assistance from several\r\ngoldsmiths, who, so guided, could not fail in their turn to become\r\nskilful masters.\r\n\r\nThe list would be long of goldsmiths who, by the single force of their\r\ntalents, or under the direction of renowned sculptors, competed during\r\ntwo centuries in the production of the marvellous works with which the\r\nchurches of Italy are still crowded; and in fact it would be only a\r\nmonotonous detail, the interest of which can scarcely be enhanced by any\r\ndescription we could give of their works. Nevertheless, we may cite the\r\nmost illustrious of them: for instance, Andrea Verrochio, in whose\r\nstudio Perugino and Leonardo da Vinci passed their time; Domenichino\r\nGhirlandajo, so called because when a goldsmith he had invented an\r\nornament in the form of garlands, of which the ladies of Florence were\r\npassionately fond; he afterwards relinquished the hammer and the graver\r\nfor the painter’s pencil; Maso Finiguerra, who, reputed to be the\r\ncleverest niello-worker of his time, engraved a _pax_, or paten, still\r\npreserved in the cabinet of bronzes in Florence; it is acknowledged to\r\nbe the plate of the first engraving printed,--the Imperial Library of\r\nParis possesses the only early proof of it.\r\n\r\nIn 1500 was born Benvenuto Cellini, who was to be the embodiment of the\r\ngenius of the goldsmith’s art, and who raised it to the zenith of its\r\npower. “Cellini, a Florentine citizen, now a sculptor,” as his\r\ncontemporary Vasari relates, “had no equal in the goldsmith’s art when\r\ndevoting himself to it in his youth, and was perhaps for many years\r\nwithout a rival, as well as in the execution of small figures in full\r\nrelief and in bas-relief, and all works of that nature. He mounted\r\nprecious stones so skilfully, and decked them in such marvellous\r\nsettings, with small figures so perfect, and sometimes so original and\r\nwith such fanciful taste, that one could not imagine anything better;\r\nnor can we adequately praise the medals which, when he was young, he\r\nengraved with incredible care in gold and silver. At Rome he executed,\r\nfor Pope Clement VII., a fastening for the cope, in which he represented\r\nwith admirable workmanship the Eternal Father. He also mounted with rare\r\ntalent a diamond, cut to a point, and surrounded by several young\r\nchildren carved in gold. Clement VII. having ordered a gold chalice with\r\nits cup supported by the theological attributes, Benvenuto executed the\r\nwork in a surprising manner. Of all the artists who, in his own time,\r\ntried their hands at engraving medals of the Pope, no one succeeded\r\nbetter, as those well know who possess them or have seen them. Also to\r\nhim was entrusted the execution of the coins of Rome; and finer pieces\r\nwere never struck. After the death of Clement VII., Benvenuto returned\r\nto Florence, where he engraved the head of Duke Alexander on the coins,\r\nwhich are so beautiful that to this day several specimens are preserved\r\nas precious antique medals; and rightly so, for in them Benvenuto\r\nsurpassed himself. At length he devoted himself to sculpture and to the\r\nart of casting statues. He executed in France, where he was in the\r\nservice of Francis I., many works in bronze, silver, and in gold.\r\nReturning to his native country, he was employed by the Duke Cosmo de\r\nMedicis, who at once required of him several works in jewellery, and\r\nafterwards some sculptures.”\r\n\r\nThus, Benvenuto is at the same time goldsmith (Fig. 104), engraver in\r\nmedals, and sculptor, and he excels in these three branches of the art,\r\nas the productions which have survived him attest. Nevertheless,\r\nunfortunately, the greater part of his works in the goldsmith’s art have\r\nbeen destroyed, or are now confounded with those of his contemporaries,\r\nupon whom Italian taste, combined with his original genius, had\r\nexercised a powerful influence. In France there remains of his works\r\nonly a magnificent salt-cellar, which he executed for Francis I.; in\r\nFlorence is preserved the mounting of a cup in lapis-lazuli,\r\nrepresenting three anchors in gold enamelled, heightened by diamonds;\r\nalso the cover, in gold enamelled, of another cup of rock-crystal. But,\r\nbesides the bronze bust of Cosmo I., we may still admire, with the group\r\nof Perseus and Medusa, which ranks among grand sculptures, the reduced\r\nform, or rather the model of that group, which in size approaches\r\ngoldsmith’s work; and the bronze pedestal, decorated with statuettes, on\r\nwhich Perseus is placed; works that enable us to see of what Cellini\r\nwas capable as a goldsmith. And, let us repeat, the influence which he\r\nexercised over his contemporaries was immense, as well in Florence as in\r\nRome, as well in France as in Germany; and, had his work been thought\r\nutterly worthless, he would remain not less justly celebrated for giving\r\nan impulse to his time by imprinting on the art which he professed a\r\nmovement as fertile as it was bold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104.--A Pendant, after a design by Benvenuto\r\nCellini. Sixteenth Century. (Cabinet of Antiquities, Bibl. Imp.,\r\nParis.)]\r\n\r\nMoreover, in imitation of the monk Theophilus, his predecessor of the\r\ntwelfth century, Benvenuto Cellini, after having given practical\r\nexample, desired that the theories he had found prevailing, and those\r\nwhich were due to his faculty for originating, should be preserved for\r\nposterity. A treatise (“Trattato intorno alle otto principali Arti dell\r\n‘Orificeria”), in which he describes and teaches all the best processes\r\nof working in gold, remains one of the most valuable works on the\r\nsubject; and even in our days goldsmiths who wish to refer back to the\r\ntrue sources of their art do not neglect to consult it.\r\n\r\nThe artistic style of the celebrated Florentine goldsmith is that of a\r\nperiod when, by an earnest return to antiquity, the mythological element\r\nwas introduced everywhere, even in the Christian sanctuaries. The\r\ncharacter, which we may call autochthone,[19] of the pious and severe\r\nMiddle Ages, ceased to influence the production of plastic works, when\r\nthe models were taken from the glorious remains of idolatrous Greece and\r\nRome. The art which the religion of Christ had awakened and upheld\r\nsuddenly became again Pagan, and Cellini proved himself one of the\r\nenthusiasts of the ancient temples raised in honour of the gods and\r\ngoddesses of Paganism; that is to say, under the impulse given by him,\r\nand in imitation of him, the phalanx of artists, of which he is in a\r\nmanner the chief, could not fail to go far on the new road by which he\r\nhad travelled among the first.\r\n\r\nWhen Cellini came to France he found, as he himself says in his book,\r\nthat the work consisted “more than elsewhere in _grosserie_” (the\r\n_grosserie_ comprised the church plate, vessels, and silver images),\r\n“and that the works there executed with the hammer had attained a degree\r\nof perfection nowhere else to be met with.”\r\n\r\nThe inventory of the plate and jewels of Henry II., among which were\r\nmany by Benvenuto Cellini--the inventory prepared at Fontainebleau in\r\n1560--shows us that, after the departure of the Florentine artist, the\r\nFrench goldsmiths continued to deserve that eulogium; and to comprehend\r\nof what they were capable in the time of Charles IX., it is sufficient\r\nto recall the description, preserved in the archives of Paris, of a\r\npiece of plate which the city had caused to be made to offer as a\r\npresent to the king on the occasion of his entry into his capital in\r\n1571.\r\n\r\n“It was,” says that document, “a large pedestal, supported on four\r\ndolphins, and having seated on it Cybele, mother of the gods,\r\nrepresenting the mother of the king, accompanied by the gods Neptune and\r\nPluto, and the goddess Juno, as Messeigneurs the brothers, and Madame\r\nthe sister, of the king. This Cybele was contemplating Jupiter, who\r\nrepresented our king, and was raised on two columns, the one of gold,\r\nthe other of silver, having his device inscribed--‘Pietate et Justitia.’\r\nUpon this was a large imperial crown, on one side held in the beak of an\r\neagle perched on the croup of a horse on which Jupiter was mounted; and\r\non the other side supported by the sceptre he held--thus being, as it\r\nwere, deified. At the four corners of the pedestal were the figures of\r\nfour kings, his predecessors, all of the same name--that is, Charles the\r\nGreat, Charles V., Charles VII., and Charles VIII., who in their time\r\nfulfilled their missions, and their reigns were happy, as we hope will\r\nbe that of our king. In the frieze of that pedestal were the battles and\r\nthe victories, of all kinds, in which he was engaged; the whole made of\r\nfine silver, gilt with ducat gold, chased, engraved, and in workmanship\r\nso executed that the style surpassed the material.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.--Cup of Lapis-lazuli, mounted in Gold enriched\r\nwith Rubies, and a Figure in Gold enamelled. (Italian Work of the 16th\r\nCentury.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106.--Vase of Rock-crystal, mounted in Silver-gilt\r\nand enamelled. (Italian Work of the 16th Century.)]\r\n\r\nThat rare piece was the work of Jean Regnard, a Parisian goldsmith; and\r\nthe period when such works were produced was precisely that during which\r\nreligious wars were about to cause the annihilation of a great number of\r\nthe _chefs-d’œuvre_, ancient and modern, of the goldsmith’s art. The new\r\niconoclasts, the Huguenots, shattered and melted down, wherever they\r\ntriumphed, the sacred vessels, the shrines, the reliquaries. Then were\r\nlost the most precious gold-wrought memorials of the times of St. Eloi,\r\nof Charlemagne, of Suger, and of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nAt the same period Germany, where the influence of the Italian school\r\nhad made itself felt less directly, but which could not escape from its\r\nimpulse, possessed also, especially at Nuremburg and Augsburg,\r\ngoldsmiths’ workshops of high character; these furnished the empire, and\r\neven foreign countries, with remarkable works. A new career opened to\r\nthe German goldsmiths when the cabinet-makers of their country had\r\ninvented those _cabinets_, whereof we have already said something\r\n(_vide_ FURNITURE), and in the intricate decoration of which appear\r\nstatuettes, silver bas-reliefs, and inlay-work of gold and precious\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nThe _treasuries_ and the museums of Germany have succeeded in preserving\r\nmany rich objects of that period; but one of the most rare collections\r\nof the kind is that in Berlin, where, in substitution for the originals\r\nin silver which have been melted down, are gathered a great number of\r\nbeautiful bas-reliefs in lead, and several vases in tin,--copies of\r\npieces of plate supposed to be of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies. And on this point it may be remarked that the high price of\r\nthe material, together with the sumptuary laws, not always admitting of\r\nthe possession of gold or silver vases by the citizens, it sometimes\r\nhappened that the goldsmiths manufactured a table-service of tin, on\r\nwhich they bestowed so much pains that these articles were transferred\r\nfrom the sideboards of citizens to those of princes. The inventory of\r\nthe Count d’Angoulême, father of Francis I., alludes to a considerable\r\ntable-service of tin. Indeed, several goldsmiths devoted themselves\r\nexclusively to this description of work; and, to this day, the tins of\r\nFrançois Briot, who flourished in the time of Henry II., are regarded as\r\nthe most perfect specimens of plate of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, after Cellini, and until the reign of Louis XIV.,\r\nthe goldsmith’s art did but follow faithfully in the footsteps of the\r\nItalian master. Elevated by the impulse of the Renaissance, the art\r\nsucceeded in maintaining itself in that high position without, however,\r\nany striking individuality discovering itself, until, in a century not\r\nless illustrious than the sixteenth, new masters appeared and imparted\r\nto it additional lustre and magnificence. These are named Ballin,\r\nDelaunay, Julien Defontaine, Labarre, Vincent Petit, Roussel, goldsmiths\r\nand jewellers of Louis XIV., who retained them in his pay, and lodged\r\nthem in the Louvre. It was for that prince they produced an imposing\r\ncollection of admirable works, for which Le Brun often furnished the\r\ndesigns, and under an inspiration altogether French, abandoned the\r\ngraceful, though rather _fluette_ forms of the Renaissance, and gave to\r\nthem a character more diffuse and grand. Then, for a short time, every\r\narticle of royal furniture proceeded from the hands of the goldsmith.\r\nBut, alas! once more the majority of these marvels must disappear, as\r\nhappened to so many others. Even the monarch who had ordered them\r\ndespatched his acquisitions to the crucibles of the mint, when, the war\r\nhaving exhausted the public treasury, he found himself compelled, at\r\nleast for example’s sake, to sacrifice his silver plate and to deck his\r\ntable with earthenware.\r\n\r\nHaving finished this sketch of the goldsmith’s art in general, it may\r\nnot be inappropriate to add a brief notice of the more special history\r\nof the French goldsmiths, of which the wealthy corporation may be\r\nconsidered not only as the most ancient, but as the model of all those\r\nthat were formed among us in the Middle Ages. But first, since we have\r\nalready referred to the exceptional part taken by the goldsmiths of\r\nLimoges in the industrial movement of that period, we cannot proceed\r\nfurther without noting another description of works, which, although\r\nderived from the oldest examples, nevertheless gave, and with justice, a\r\nkind of new lustre to the ancient city where the first goldsmiths of\r\nFrance had distinguished themselves.\r\n\r\n“Towards the end of the fourteenth century,” says M. Labarte, “the taste\r\nfor gold and silver articles having led to the disuse of plate of\r\nenamelled copper, the Limousine enamellers endeavoured to discover a new\r\nmode of applying enamel to the reproduction of graphic subjects. Their\r\nresearches led them to dispense with the chaser for delineating the\r\noutlines of designs; the metal was entirely concealed under the enamel,\r\nwhich, spread by the brush, formed altogether both the drawing and the\r\ncolouring. The first attempts at this novel painting on copper were\r\nnecessarily very imperfect; but the processes gradually improved, until\r\nat length, in 1540, they attained perfection. Prior to that period, the\r\nenamels of Limoges were almost exclusively devoted to the reproduction\r\nof sacred subjects, of which the German school furnished the designs.\r\nBut the arrival of Italian artists at the court of Francis I., and the\r\npublication of engravings of the works of Raphael and other great\r\nmasters of Italy, gave a new direction to the school of Limoges, which\r\nadopted the style of that of Italy. Il Rosso and Primaticcio painted\r\ncartoons for the Limousine enamellers; and then\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAGEOIR, OR TABLE ORNAMENT\r\n\r\nOf Enamelled and Gilt Copper. German, latter part of Sixteenth\r\nCentury.]\r\n\r\nthey who had previously worked only on plates intended to be set in\r\ndiptychs, on caskets, created a new species of goldsmith’s art. Basins,\r\newers, cups, salt-cellars, vases, and utensils of all sorts,\r\nmanufactured with thin sheet-copper in the most elegant forms were\r\ndecorated with their rich and brilliant paintings.”\r\n\r\nIn the highest rank of artists who have rendered this attractive work\r\nillustrious we must place Léonard (Limousin), painter to Francis I., who\r\nwas the first director of the royal manufacture of enamels founded by\r\nthat king at Limoges. Then followed Pierre Raymond (Figs. 107 to 110),\r\nwhose works date from 1534 to 1578, the Penicauds, Courteys, Martial\r\nRaymond, Mercier, and Jean Limousin, enameller to Anne of Austria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 107 and 108.--Faces of an Hexagonal Enamelled\r\nSalt-cellar, representing the Labours of Hercules. Executed at Limoges,\r\nfor Francis I., by Pierre Raymond.]\r\n\r\nWith the remark that, at the end of the sixteenth century, Venice,\r\ndoubtless imitating Limoges, also manufactured pieces of plate in\r\nenamelled copper, we return to our national goldsmiths.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated corporation could, without much trouble, be traced back\r\nin Gaul to the epoch of the Roman occupation; but it is unnecessary to\r\nsearch for its origin beyond St. Eloi, who is still its patron, after\r\nhaving been its founder and protector. Eloi, become prime-minister to\r\nDagobert I.--thanks in some measure to his merits as a goldsmith, which\r\ndistinguished him above all, and gained him the honour of royal\r\nfriendship--continued to work no less at his forge as a simple artisan.\r\n“He made for the king,” says the chronicle, “a great number of gold\r\nvases enriched with precious stones, and he worked incessantly, seated\r\nwith his servant Thillon, a Saxon by birth, at his side, who followed\r\nthe lessons of his master.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.--Interior base of a Salt-cellar, executed at\r\nLimoges; with a Portrait of Francis I.]\r\n\r\nThis extract seems to indicate that already the goldsmith’s art was\r\norganised as a corporation, and that it comprised three ranks of\r\nartisans--the masters, the journeymen, and the apprentices. Besides, it\r\nis clear that St. Eloi founded two distinct corporations of\r\ngoldsmiths--one for secular, the other for religious works, in order\r\nthat the objects sacred to worship should not be manufactured by the\r\nsame hands that executed those designed for profane uses or worldly\r\nstate. The seat of the former in Paris was first the Cité, near the very\r\nabode of St. Eloi long known as the _maison au fèvre_, and surrounding\r\nthe monastery of St. Martial. Within the jurisdiction of that monastery\r\nwas the space comprised between the streets of La Barillerie, of La\r\nCalandre, Aux Fèves, and of La Vieille Draperie, under the denomination\r\nof “St. Eloi’s Enclosure.” A raging fire destroyed the entire quarter\r\ninhabited by the goldsmiths, excepting the monastery; and the lay\r\ngoldsmiths went forth and established themselves as a colony, still\r\nunder the auspices of their patron saint, in the shadow of the Church of\r\nSt. Paul des Champs, which he had caused to be constructed on the right\r\nbank of the Seine. The assemblage of forges and shops of these artisans\r\nsoon formed a sort of suburb, which was called _Clôture_, or _Culture\r\nSt. Eloi_. Subsequently some of the goldsmiths returned to the Cité; but\r\nthey remained on the Grand-Pont, and returned no more to the streets,\r\nwhere the cobblers had established themselves. Moreover, the monastery\r\nof St. Martial had become, under the administration of its first abbess,\r\nSt. Anne, a branch of the goldsmith’s school which the “Seigneur Eloi”\r\nhad established in 631 in the Abbey of Solignac, in the environs of\r\nLimoges. That abbey, whose first abbot, Thillon or Théau--a pupil, or,\r\nas the chronicle expresses it, a servant of St. Eloi--was also a skilful\r\ngoldsmith, preserved during several centuries the traditions of its\r\nfounder, and furnished not only models, but also skilful workmen, to all\r\nthe monastic ateliers of Christendom which exclusively manufactured for\r\nthe churches jewelled and enamelled plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.--Ewer in Enamel, of Limoges, by Pierre\r\nRaymond.]\r\n\r\nHowever, the goldsmiths of Paris engaged in secular works continued to\r\nmaintain themselves as a corporation; and their privileges, which they\r\nascribed to the special regard of Dagobert for St. Eloi, were\r\nrecognised, it is said, in 768 by a royal charter, and confirmed in 846\r\nin a capitulary of Charles the Bald. These goldsmiths worked in gold and\r\nsilver only for kings and nobles, whom the strictness of the sumptuary\r\nlaws did not reach. The Dictionary of Jean de Garlande informs us that,\r\nin the eleventh century, there were in Paris four classes of workmen in\r\nthe goldsmith’s trade--those who coined money (_nummularii_), the\r\nclasp-makers (_firmacularii_), the manufacturers of drinking-goblets\r\n(_cipharii_), and the goldsmiths, properly so called (_aurifabri_). The\r\nateliers and the shop-windows of these last were on the Pont-au-Change\r\n(Fig. 111), in competition with the money-changers, who for the most\r\npart were Lombards or Italians. From that epoch a rivalry commenced\r\nbetween these two trade guilds, which only ceased on the complete\r\ndownfall of the money-changers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.--Interior of the Atelier of Etienne Delaulne, a\r\ncelebrated goldsmith of Paris, in the Sixteenth Century. Designed and\r\nengraved by himself.]\r\n\r\nWhen Etienne Boileau, Provost of Paris in the reign of Louis IX., wrote\r\nin obedience to the legislative designs of the king, his famous “Livre\r\ndes Métiers,” to establish the existence of guilds on permanent\r\nfoundations, he had scarcely more to do than to transcribe the statutes\r\nof the goldsmiths almost the same as those instituted by St. Eloi, with\r\nthe modifications consequent on the new order of things. By the terms of\r\nthe ordinances drawn up by Louis, the goldsmiths of Paris were exempt\r\nfrom the watch, and from all other feudal services; they elected, every\r\nthree years, two or three _anciens_ (seniors) “for the protection of\r\nthe trade,” and these _anciens_ exercised permanent vigilance over the\r\nworks of their colleagues, and over the quality of the gold and silver\r\nmaterial used by them. An apprentice was not admitted as a master until\r\nafter ten years’ apprenticeship; and no master could have more than one\r\napprentice, in addition to those belonging to his own family. The\r\ncorporation, so far as concerned the fraternity with respect to works\r\nfor charitable and devotional purposes, had a seal (Fig. 116) which\r\nplaced it under the patronage of St. Eloi; but, with regard to its\r\nindustrial association, it imprinted on manufactured articles a _seing_,\r\nor stamp, which guaranteed the value of the metal. The corporation soon\r\nobtained, from Philip of Valois, a coat-of-arms, which conferred on it a\r\nsort of professional nobility; and acquired, owing to the distinguished\r\nprotection extended to it by that king, a position which nevertheless it\r\ndid not succeed in preserving in the united constitution of the six\r\nmercantile bodies; for, although it laid claim to the first rank on\r\naccount of its antiquity, it was forced, notwithstanding the undeniable\r\nsuperiority of its works, to be contented with the second, and even to\r\ndescend to the third rank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.--Stamp of Lyons.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.--Stamp of Chartres.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.--Stamp of Melun.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116.--Ancient Corporate Seal of the Goldsmiths of\r\nParis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115.--Stamp of Orléans.]\r\n\r\nThe goldsmiths, at the time of the compilation of the code of\r\nprofessions by Etienne Boileau, were already separated, voluntarily or\r\notherwise, from several trades which had long appeared in their train;\r\nthe _cristalliers_, or lapidaries; the gold and silver beaters; the\r\nembroiderers in _orfroi_ (gold-fringe); the _patenôtriers_\r\n(bead-stringers) in precious stones lived under their own regulations;\r\nthe _monétaires_ (bullion-dealers) remained under the control of the\r\nking and his mint; the _hanapiers_ (drinking-cup makers), the\r\n_fermailleurs_ (makers of clasps), the pewterers, boxmakers, inferior\r\nartisans and others who worked in common metals, had no longer any\r\nconnection with the goldsmiths of Paris. But in the provinces, in towns\r\nwhere the masters of a trade were insufficient to constitute a community\r\nor fraternity having its chiefs and its own administration, it was\r\nindispensable to reunite under the same banner the trades between which\r\nthere was the most agreement, or rather the least contrariety. Thus, in\r\ncertain localities in France and the Low Countries, the goldsmiths,\r\nproud as they might be of the nobility of their origin, sometimes found\r\nthemselves united as equals with the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117.--Arms of the Corporation of Goldsmiths of\r\nParis, with this device: “Vases Sacrés et Couronnes, voilà notre\r\nŒuvre.”]\r\n\r\npewterers, the mercers, the braziers, and even the grocers; and thus it\r\ncame to pass that they combined on their banners of fleurs-de-lis the\r\nproper arms of each of these several trades. Thus, for instance, we see\r\nthe banner of the goldsmiths of Castellane (Fig. 118) united with the\r\nretail mercers and tailors--it shows a pair of scissors, scales, and an\r\nell measure; at Chauny (Fig. 119), a ladder, a hammer, and a vase,\r\nindicate that the goldsmiths had for compeers the pewterers and the\r\nslaters; at Guise (Fig. 120), the association of farriers, coppersmiths,\r\nand locksmiths, is allied with the goldsmiths by a horse-shoe, a mallet,\r\nand a key; the brewers of Harfleur (Fig. 121) quartered in their arms\r\nfour barrels between the bars of the cross _gules_ charged with a goblet\r\nof gold, which was the emblem of their associates the goldsmiths; at\r\nMaringues (Fig. 122), the gold cup on a field _gules_ surmounts the\r\ngrocer’s candles.\r\n\r\nThese banners were displayed only on great public ceremonies, in solemn\r\nprocessions, receptions, marriages, the obsequies of kings, queens,\r\nprinces, and princesses. Exempted from military service, the goldsmiths,\r\nunlike other trade corporations, had not the opportunity of\r\ndistinguishing themselves in the militia of the communes. They,\r\nnevertheless, occupied the first place in the state processions of\r\ntrades, and frequently filled posts of honour. Thus in Paris they had\r\nthe custody of the gold and silver plate when the good city entertained\r\nsome illustrious guest at a banquet; they carried the canopy above the\r\nhead of the king on his joyful accession; or, crowned with roses, walked\r\nbearing on their shoulders the venerated shrine of St. Geneviève (Fig.\r\n123).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122.]\r\n\r\nIn the wealthy cities of Belgium, where the corporations were queens\r\n(_reines_), the goldsmiths, by virtue of their privileges, dictated the\r\nlaw and swayed the people. No doubt in France they were far from\r\nenjoying the same political influence; nevertheless, one of them was\r\nthat provost of merchants, Etienne Marcel, who, from 1356 to 1358,\r\nplayed so bold a part during the regency of the Dauphin Charles. But it\r\nwas especially in periods of peace and prosperity that the goldsmith’s\r\nart in Paris shone in all its splendour; then its banners incessantly\r\nwaved in the breeze for the festivals and processions of its numerous\r\nand wealthy brotherhoods to the churches of Notre-Dame, St. Martial, St.\r\nPaul, and St. Denis of Montmartre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123.--The Corporation of the Goldsmiths of Paris\r\ncarrying the Shrine of St. Geneviève. (From an engraving of the\r\nSeventeenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nIn 1337 the number of the wardens of the goldsmith’s guild in Paris had\r\nincreased from three to six. They had their names engraved and their\r\nmarks stamped on tablets of copper, which were preserved as archives in\r\nthe town-hall. Every French goldsmith, admitted a master after the\r\nproduction of his principal work, left the impression of his sign\r\nmanual, or private mark, on similar tablets of copper deposited in the\r\noffice of the guild; while the stamp of the community itself was\r\nrequired to be engraved at the mint to authorise its being used. Every\r\ncorporation thus had its mark, which the wardens set on the articles\r\nafter having assayed and weighed the metal. These marks, at least in the\r\nlater centuries, represented in general the special arms or emblems of\r\nthe cities; for Lyons, it is a lion; for Melun, an eel; for Chartres, a\r\npartridge; for Orleans, the head of Joan of Arc, &c. (Figs. 112 to 115).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124.--Gold Cross, chased. (A French Work of the\r\nSeventeenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nThe goldsmiths of France manifested, and with reason, a jealousy of\r\ntheir privileges, it being more indispensable for them than for any\r\nother artisans to inspire that confidence without which the trade would\r\nhave been lost; for their works were required to bear as authentic and\r\nlegal a value as that of money. Therefore, it may be understood that\r\nthey exercised keen vigilance over all gold or silver objects which were\r\nin any way under their warranty: hence the frequent visits of the sworn\r\nmasters to the ateliers and shops of the goldsmiths; hence the perpetual\r\nlawsuits against all instances of negligence or fraud; hence those\r\nquarrels with other trades which arrogated to themselves the right of\r\nworking in precious metals without having qualified for it. Confiscation\r\nof goods, the whip, the pillory, were penalties inflicted on goldsmiths\r\nin contraband trade who altered the standard, concealed copper beneath\r\nthe gold, or substituted false for precious stones.\r\n\r\nIt, indeed, seems remarkable that while for the most part other trades\r\nwere subject to the control of the goldsmiths, the latter were\r\nresponsible only to themselves for the aggressions which they constantly\r\ncommitted within the domain of rival industries. Whenever the object to\r\nbe manufactured was of gold, it belonged to the goldsmith’s trade. The\r\ngoldsmith made, by turns, spurs as the spur-maker; armour and arms, as\r\nthe armourer; girdles and clasps, as the belt-maker and the clasp-maker.\r\nHowever, there is reason to believe that in the fabrication of these\r\nvarious objects, the goldsmith had recourse to the assistance of special\r\nartisans, who could scarcely fail to derive all possible advantage from\r\nsuch fortuitous association. Thus, when the gold-wrought sword which\r\nDunois carried when Charles VII. entered Lyons in 1449, mounted in\r\ndiamonds and rubies, and valued at more than fifteen thousand crowns,\r\nwas to be made, the work of the goldsmiths probably consisted only of\r\nthe fashioning and chasing the hilt, while the sword-cutler had to forge\r\nand temper the blade. In the same manner, when it was required to work a\r\njewelled robe, such as Marie de Medicis wore at the baptism of her son\r\nin 1606, the robe being covered with thirty-two thousand precious stones\r\nand three thousand diamonds, the goldsmith had only to mount the stones\r\nand furnish the design for fixing them on the gold or silk tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125.--Pendant, adorned with Diamonds and Precious\r\nStones. (Seventeenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nLong before Benvenuto and other skilful Italian goldsmiths were summoned\r\nby Francis I. to his court, the French goldsmiths had proved that they\r\nneeded only a little encouragement to range themselves on a level with\r\nforeign artists. But that patronage having failed them, they left the\r\ncountry and established themselves elsewhere; thus at the court of\r\nFlanders, Antoine of Bordeaux, Margerie of Avignon, and Jean of Rouen,\r\ndistinguished themselves. It is true that in the reign of Louis XII.,\r\nwhose exchequer had been exhausted in the Italian expeditions, gold and\r\nsilver had become so scarce in France, that the king was obliged to\r\nprohibit the manufacture of all sorts of large plate (_grosserie_). But\r\nthe discovery of America having brought with it an abundance of the\r\nprecious metals, Louis XII. recalled his ordinance in 1510; and\r\nthenceforth the corporations of goldsmiths were seen to increase and\r\nprosper, as luxuriousness, diffused by the example of the great,\r\ndescended to the lower ranks of society. Silver plate soon displaced\r\nthat of tin; and before long personal display had attained such a\r\nheight, “that the wife of a merchant wore on her person more jewels than\r\nwere seen on the image of the Virgin.” The number of the goldsmiths then\r\nbecame so great that in the city of Rouen alone there were in 1563 _two\r\nhundred and sixty-five_ masters having the right of stamp!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 126 to 131.--Chains.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 132 to 136.--Rings.]\r\n\r\nTo sum up this chapter. Until the middle of the fourteenth century it is\r\nthe religious art which prevails; the goldsmiths are engaged only in\r\nexecuting shrines, reliquaries, and church ornaments. At the end of that\r\ncentury, and during the one following, they manufactured gold and\r\nsilver\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 137 to 141.--Seals.]\r\n\r\nplate, enriching with their works the treasuries of kings and nobles,\r\nand imparting brilliant display to the adornment of dress. In the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries the goldsmiths applied themselves\r\nmore to chasing, enamelling, and inlay-work. Everywhere are to be seen\r\nmarvellous trinkets--necklaces, rings, buckles, chains, seals (Figs. 124\r\nto 142). The weight of metal is no longer the principal merit; the skill\r\nof the workman is especially appreciated, and the goldsmith executes in\r\ngold, in silver, and in precious stones, the beautiful productions of\r\npainters and engravers. Nevertheless, the demand for delicate objects\r\nhad the disadvantage of requiring much solder and alloy, which\r\ndeteriorated the standard of metal. Then a desperate struggle commenced\r\nbetween the goldsmiths and the mint--a struggle which was prosecuted\r\nthrough a maze of legal proceedings, petitions, and ordinances, until\r\nthe middle of the reign of Louis XV. At the same time the Italian and\r\nGerman goldsmiths making an irruption into France and introducing\r\nmaterials of a low standard, the old professional integrity became\r\nsuspected and was soon disregarded. At the end of the sixteenth century\r\nvery little plate was ornamented: there is a return to massive plate,\r\nthe weight and standard of which could be easily verified. Gold is\r\nscarcely any longer employed, except for jewels; and silver in a\r\nthousand forms creeps into the manufacture of furniture. After\r\n_cabinets_, covered and ornamented with carving in silver, came the\r\narticles of silver furniture invented by Claude Ballin. But the mass of\r\nprecious metal withdrawn from circulation was soon returned to it, and\r\nthe fashion passed away. The goldsmiths found themselves reduced to\r\nmanufacture only objects of small size; and for the most part they\r\nlimited themselves to works of jewellery, which subjected them to less\r\nannoyance from the mint. Besides, the art of the lapidary had almost\r\nchanged its character, as well as the trade in precious stones. Pierre\r\nde Montarsy, jeweller to the king, effected a kind of revolution in his\r\nart, which the travels of Chardin, of Bernier, and of Tavernier, in the\r\nEast had, so to say, enlarged. The cutting and mounting of precious\r\nstones has not since been excelled. It may be said that Montarsy was the\r\nfirst jeweller, as Ballin was the last goldsmith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142.--Chased and Enamelled Brooch, embellished with\r\nPearls and Diamonds.

It would be\r\ndifficult to determine which of these three chronometric modes can lay\r\nclaim to priority. There is this to be said that, according to the\r\nBible, in the eighth century before Christ, Ahaz, King of Judah, caused\r\na sun-dial to be constructed at Jerusalem; again, Herodotus says\r\nAnaximander introduced the sun-dial into Greece, whence it passed on to\r\nthe other parts of the then civilised world; and that, in the year 293\r\nbefore our era, the celebrated Papirius Cursor, to the astonishment of\r\nhis fellow-citizens, had a sun-dial traced near the temple of Jupiter\r\nQuirinus.\r\n\r\nAccording to the description given by Athena (Athenæus?), the\r\nwater-clock was formed of an earthenware or metal vessel filled with\r\nwater, and then suspended over a reservoir whereon lines were marked\r\nindicating the hours, as the water which escaped drop by drop from the\r\nupper vessel came to the level. We find this instrument employed by most\r\nancient nations, and in many countries it remained in use until the\r\ntenth century of the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143.--The Clockmaker. Designed and Engraved by J.\r\nAmman.]\r\n\r\nIn one of his dialogues Plato declares that the philosophers are far\r\nmore fortunate than the orators--“these being the slaves of a miserable\r\nwater-clock; whereas the others are at liberty to make their discourse\r\nas long as they please.” To explain this passage, we must remember that\r\nit was the practice in the Athenian courts of justice, as subsequently\r\nin those of Rome, to measure the time allowed to the advocates for\r\npleading by means of a water-clock. Three equal portions of water were\r\nput into it--one for the prosecutor, one for the defendant, and the\r\nthird for the judge. A man was charged with the special duty of giving\r\ntimely notice to each of the three speakers that his portion was nearly\r\nrun out. If, on some unusual occasion, the time for one or other of the\r\nparties was doubled, it was called “adding water-clock to water-clock;”\r\nand when witnesses were giving evidence, or the text of some law was\r\nbeing read out, the percolation of the water was stopped: this was\r\ncalled _aquam sustinere_ (to retain the water).\r\n\r\nThe hour-glass, which is still in use to a considerable extent for\r\nmeasuring short intervals of time, had great analogy with the\r\nwater-clock, but was never susceptible of such regularity. In fact, at\r\ndifferent periods important improvements were applied to the\r\nwater-clock. Vitruvius tells us that, about one hundred years before our\r\nera, Ctesibius, a mechanician of Alexandria, added several cogged-wheels\r\nto the water-clock, one of which moved a hand, showing the hour on a\r\ndial. This must have been, so far as historical documents admit of\r\nproof, the first step towards purely mechanical horology.\r\n\r\nIn order, then, to find an authentic date in the history of horology, we\r\nmust go to the eighth century, when water-clocks, still further\r\nimproved, were either made or imported into France; among others, one\r\nwhich Pope Paul I. sent to Pepin le Bref. We must, however, believe that\r\nthese instruments can have attracted but little attention, or that they\r\nwere speedily forgotten; for, one hundred years later, there appeared a\r\nwater-clock at the court of Charlemagne, a present from the famous\r\ncaliph Aroun-al-Raschid, regarded, indeed almost celebrated, as a\r\nnotable event. Of this Eginhard has left us an elaborate description. It\r\nwas, he says, in brass, damaskeened with gold, and marked the hours on a\r\ndial. At the end of each hour an equal number of small iron balls fell\r\non a bell, and made it sound as many times as the hour indicated by the\r\nneedle. Twelve windows immediately opened, out of which were seen to\r\nproceed the same number of horsemen armed _cap-à-pie_, who, after\r\nperforming divers evolutions, withdrew into the interior of the\r\nmechanism, and then the windows closed.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards Pacificus, Archbishop of Verona, constructed one far\r\nsuperior to all that had preceded it; for, besides giving the hours, it\r\nindicated the date of the month, the days of the week, the phases of the\r\nmoon, &c. But still it was only an improved water-clock. Before horology\r\ncould really assume an historical date, it was necessary that for motive\r\npower weights should be substituted for water, and that the escapement\r\nshould be invented; yet it was only in the beginning of the tenth\r\ncentury that these important discoveries were made.\r\n\r\n“In the reign of Hugh Capet,” says M. Dubois, “there lived in France a\r\nman of great talent and reputation named Gerbert. He was born in the\r\nmountains of Auvergne, and had passed his childhood in tending flocks\r\nnear Aurillac. One day some monks of the order of St. Benedict met him\r\nin the fields: they conversed with him, and finding him precociously\r\nintelligent, took him into their convent of St. Gérauld. There Gerbert\r\nsoon acquired a taste for monastic life. Eager for knowledge, and\r\ndevoting all his spare moments to study, he became the most learned of\r\nthe community. After he had taken vows, a desire to add to his\r\nscientific attainments led him to set out for Spain. During several\r\nyears he assiduously frequented the universities of the Iberian\r\npeninsula. He soon found himself too learned for Spain; for, in spite of\r\nhis truly sincere piety, ignorant fanatics accused him of sorcery. As\r\nthat accusation might have involved him in deplorable consequences, he\r\npreferred not to await the result; and hastily quitting the town of\r\nSalamanca, which was his ordinary residence, he came to Paris, where he\r\nvery soon made himself powerful friends and protectors. At length, after\r\nhaving successively been monk, superior of the convent of Bobbio, in\r\nItaly, Archbishop of Rheims, tutor to Robert I., King of France, and to\r\nOtho III., Emperor of Germany, who appointed him to the see of Ravenna,\r\nGerbert rose to the pontifical throne under the name of Sylvester II.:\r\nhe died in 1003. This great man did honour to his country and to his\r\nage. He was acquainted with nearly all the dead and living languages; he\r\nwas a mechanician, astronomer, physician, geometrician, algebraist, &c.\r\nHe introduced the Arab numerals into France. In the seclusion of his\r\nmonastic cell, as in his archiepiscopal palace, his favourite relaxation\r\nwas the study of mechanics. He was skilled in making sun-dials,\r\nwater-clocks, hour-glasses, and hydraulic organs. It was he who first\r\napplied weight as a motive power to horology; and, in all probability,\r\nhe is the inventor of that admirable mechanism called escapement--the\r\nmost beautiful, as well as the most essential, of all the inventions\r\nwhich have been made in horology.”\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to give a description of these two mechanisms,\r\nwhich can hardly be explained except with the assistance of purely\r\ntechnical drawings, but it may be remarked that weights are still the\r\nsole motive power of large clocks, and the escapement alluded to has\r\nbeen alone employed throughout the world until the end of the\r\nseventeenth century. Notwithstanding the importance of these two\r\ninventions, little use was made of them during the eleventh, twelfth,\r\nand thirteenth centuries. The water-clock and hour-glass (Fig. 144)\r\ncontinued exclusively in use. Some were ornamented and engraved with\r\nmuch taste; and they contributed to the decoration of apartments, as at\r\npresent do our bronzes and clocks more or less costly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144.--An Hour-glass of the Sixteenth\r\nCentury,--French Work.]\r\n\r\nHistory does not inform us who was the inventor of the striking\r\nmachinery; but it is at least averred that it existed at the\r\ncommencement of the twelfth century. The first mention of it is found in\r\nthe “Usages de l’Ordre de Cîteaux,” compiled about 1120. It is there\r\nprescribed to the sacristan so to regulate the clock, that it “sounds\r\nand awakens him before matins;” in another chapter the monk is ordered\r\nto prolong the lecture until “the clock strikes.” At first, in the\r\nmonasteries, the monks took it in turn to watch, and warn the community\r\nof the hours for prayer; and, in the towns, there were night watchmen,\r\nwho, moreover, were maintained in many places to announce in the streets\r\nthe hour denoted by the clocks, the water-clocks, or the hour-glasses.\r\n\r\nThe machinery for striking once invented, we do not find that horology\r\nhad attained to any perfection before the end of the thirteenth century;\r\nbut, in the commencement of the following it received its impulse, and\r\nthe art from that time continued to progress.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of what was effected at that time, we will borrow a\r\npassage from the earliest writings in which horology is mentioned; that\r\nis, from an unpublished book by Philip de Maizières, entitled “Le Songe\r\ndu Vieil Pélerin:”--“It is known that in Italy there is at present\r\n(about 1350) a man generally celebrated in philosophy, in medicine, and\r\nin astronomy; in his station, by common report, singular and grave,\r\nexcelling in the above three sciences, and of the city of Padua. His\r\nsurname is lost, and he is called ‘Maistre Jehan des Orloges,’ residing\r\nat present with the Comte de Vertus; and, for the treble sciences, he\r\nhas for yearly wages and perquisites two thousand florins, or\r\nthereabouts. This Maistre Jean des Orloges has made an instrument, by\r\nsome called a _sphere_ or clock, of the movement of the heavens, in\r\nwhich instrument are all the motions of the signs (zodiacal), and of the\r\nplanets, with their circles and epicycles, and multiplied differences,\r\nwheels (_roes_) without number, with all their parts, and each planet in\r\nthe said sphere, distinctly. On any given night, we see clearly in what\r\nsign and degree are the planets and the stars of the heavens; and this\r\nsphere is so cunningly made, that notwithstanding the multitude of\r\nwheels, which cannot well be numbered without taking the machinery to\r\npieces, their entire mechanism is governed by one single counterpoise,\r\nso marvellous that the grave astronomers from distant regions come with\r\ngreat reverence to visit the said Maistre Jean and the work of his\r\nhands; and all the great clerks of astronomy, of philosophy, and of\r\nmedicine, declare that there is no recollection of a man, either in\r\nwritten document or otherwise, who in this world has made so ingenious\r\nor so important an instrument of the heavenly movements as the said\r\nclock.... Maistre Jean made the said clock with his own hands, all of\r\nbrass and of copper, without the assistance of any other person, and did\r\nnothing else during sixteen entire years, if the writer of the book, who\r\nhad a great friendship for the said Maistre Jean, has been rightly\r\ninformed.”\r\n\r\nIt is known, on the other hand, that the famous clockmaker, whose real\r\nname Maizières assumes to be lost, was called Jaques de Dondis; and\r\nthat, in spite of the assertion of the writer, he had only to arrange\r\nthe clock, the parts of which had been executed by an excellent workman\r\nnamed Antoine. However this may be, placed at the top of one of the\r\ntowers of the palace of Padua, the clock of Jaques de Dondis, or of\r\n“Maistre Jean des Orloges,” excited general admiration, and several\r\nprinces of Europe being desirous to have similar clocks, many workmen\r\ntried to imitate it. In fact, churches or monasteries were soon able to\r\npride themselves on possessing similar _chefs-d’œuvre_.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable clocks of that period, we must refer to that\r\nof which Froissart speaks, and which was carried away from the town of\r\nCourtray by Philip the Bold after the battle of Rosbecque in 1382. “The\r\nDuke of Burgundy,” says our author, “caused to be carried away from the\r\nmarket-place a clock that struck the hours, one of the finest which\r\ncould be found on either side the sea; and he conveyed it piece by piece\r\nin carts, and the bell also. Which clock was brought and carted into the\r\ntown of Dijon, in Burgundy, was there deposited and put up, and there\r\nstrikes the twenty-four hours between day and night.”\r\n\r\nIt is the celebrated clock of Dijon which then as now was surmounted by\r\ntwo automata of iron, a man and a woman, striking the hours on the bell.\r\nThe origin of the name of _Jacquemart_ given to these figures has been\r\nmuch disputed. Ménage believes that the word is derived from the Latin\r\n_jaccomarchiardus_ (coat of mail--attire of war); and he reminds us\r\nthat, in the Middle Ages, it was the custom to station, on the summit of\r\nthe towers, men (soldiers wearing the _jacque_) to give warning of the\r\napproach of the enemy, of fires, &c. Ménage adds that, when more\r\nefficient watchers occasioned the discontinuance of these nocturnal\r\nsentinels, it was probably considered desirable to preserve the\r\nremembrance of them by putting in the place they had occupied iron\r\nfigures which struck the hours. Other writers trace the name even to the\r\ninventor of this description of clocks, who, according to them, lived in\r\nthe fourteenth century, and was called Jacques Marck. Finally, Gabriel\r\nPeignot, who has written a dissertation on the _jacquemart_ of Dijon,\r\nasserts that in 1422 a person named Jacquemart, clockmaker and\r\nlocksmith, residing in the town of Lille, received twenty-two livres\r\nfrom the Duke of Burgundy, for repairing the clock of Dijon; and from\r\nthat he concludes, seeing how short the distance is from Lille to\r\nCourtray, whence the clock of Dijon had been taken, that this Jacquemart\r\nmight well be the son or the grandson of the clockmaker who had\r\nconstructed it about 1360; consequently the name of the _jacquemart_ of\r\nDijon is derived from that of its maker, old Jacquemart, the clockmaker\r\nof Lille (Fig. 145).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145.--Jacquemart of Notre-Dame at Dijon, made at\r\nCourtray in the Fourteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nGiving to each of these opinions its due weight, we confine ourselves to\r\nstating that, from the end of the fourteenth century to the beginning\r\nof the fifteenth, numerous churches in Germany, Italy, and France\r\nalready had _jacquemarts_.\r\n\r\nThe first clock possessed by Paris was that in the turret of the Palais\r\nde Justice. Charles V. had it constructed in 1370 by a German artisan,\r\nHenri de Vic. It contained a weight for moving power, an oscillating\r\npiece for regulator, and an escapement. It was adorned with carvings by\r\nGermain Pilon, and was destroyed in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn 1389, the clockmaker Jean Jouvence made one for the Castle of\r\nMontargis. Those of Sens and of Auxerre, as well as that of Lund in\r\nSweden, date from the same period. In the last, every hour two cavaliers\r\nmet and gave each other as many blows as the hours to be struck: then a\r\ndoor opened, and the Virgin Mary appeared sitting on a throne, with the\r\nInfant Jesus in her arms, receiving the visit of the Magi followed by\r\ntheir retinue; the Magi prostrating themselves and tendering their\r\npresents. During the ceremony two trumpets sounded: then all vanished,\r\nto re-appear the following hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146.--Clock with Wheels and Weights. Fifteenth\r\nCentury. (Cabinet of Antiquities, Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nUntil the end of the thirteenth century, clocks were destined\r\nexclusively\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 147.--A portable Clock of the time of the Valois.]\r\n\r\nto public buildings; or they at least affected, if we may say so, a\r\nmonumental character which precluded their admission into private\r\nhouses. The first clocks with weights and the flywheel made for private\r\nuse appeared in France, in Italy, and in Germany, about the commencement\r\nof the fourteenth century; but naturally they were at first so costly\r\nthat only nobles and wealthy persons could obtain them. But an impulse\r\nwas given which led to the manufacture of these objects more\r\neconomically. In fact, it was not long before portable clocks were seen\r\nin the most unpretentious abodes. This of course did not prevent the\r\nproduction of expensive examples, either as regards ornamentation or\r\ncarving, or in placing the clock on costly pedestals or cases, within\r\nwhich were suspended the weights (Fig. 146).\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century has distinctly left its mark on the progress of\r\nhorology. In 1401 the Cathedral of Seville was enriched with a\r\nmagnificent clock which struck the hours. In 1404, Lazare, a Servian by\r\nbirth, constructed a similar one for Moscow. That of Lubeck, which was\r\nembellished with the figures of the twelve Apostles, dates from 1405. It\r\nis proper to notice also the famous clock which Jean-Galeas Visconti had\r\nmade for Pavia; and more especially that of St. Marc of Venice, which\r\nwas not executed until 1495.\r\n\r\nThe spiral spring was invented in the time of Charles VII.: a band of\r\nvery fine steel, rolled up into a small drum or barrel, produced, in\r\nunrolling, the effect of the weights on the primitive movements. To the\r\npossibility of enclosing that moving power in a confined space is due\r\nthe facility of manufacturing very small clocks. In fact, one finds in\r\ncertain collections, clocks of the time of Louis XI., remarkable not\r\nonly for the artistic richness of their decoration, but still more so\r\nfor the small space they occupy, although they are generally of very\r\ncomplicated mechanism; some marking the date of the month, striking the\r\nhour, and serving also as alarm-clocks.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the exact date of the\r\ninvention of watches. But, in truth, we ought perhaps to regard the\r\nwatch, especially after the invention of the spiral spring, as only the\r\nlast step taken towards a portable form of clock. It is however true,\r\naccording to the statements found in Pancirole and Du Verdier by the\r\nauthors of the “Encyclopædia of Sciences,” that at the end of the\r\nfifteenth century watches were made no larger than an almond. Even the\r\nnames Myrmécides and Carovagius are cited as those of two celebrated\r\nartisans in such work. It was said that the latter made an alarm-watch\r\nwhich not only sounded the hour required, but even struck a light to\r\nignite a candle. Besides, we know for certain that, in the time of Louis\r\nXI., there were watches very small yet perfectly manufactured; and it is\r\nproved that, in 1500, at Nuremberg, Peter Hele made them of the form of\r\nan egg, and consequently the watches of that country were long known as\r\n_Nuremberg eggs_.\r\n\r\nWe learn, moreover, from history that in 1542, a watch which struck the\r\nhours, set in a ring, was offered to Guidobaldo of Rovere; and that in\r\n1575, Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury, bequeathed to his brother\r\nRichard a cane of Indian wood having a watch placed in its head; and,\r\nfinally, that Henry VIII. of England wore a very small watch requiring\r\nto be wound up only every eighth day.\r\n\r\nIt is not inappropriate here to remark that the time kept by these\r\nlittle machines was not regular until an ingenious workman, whose name\r\nhas not come down to us, invented the fusee, a kind of truncated cone;\r\nto the base of this was attached a small piece of catgut which, spirally\r\nrolling itself up to the top, became fastened to the barrel that\r\nenclosed the spring. The advantage of this arrangement is, that owing to\r\nthe conical form of the fusee, the traction of the spring acting as it\r\nrelaxes on a greater radius of the cone, it results in establishing\r\nequilibrium of power between the first and the last movements of the\r\nspring. Subsequently a clockmaker named Gruet substituted jointed\r\n(_articulées_) chains for catgut; the latter having the great\r\ndisadvantage of being hygrometric and varying in tension with the state\r\nof the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe use of watches spread rapidly in France. In the reigns of the\r\nValois, a large number were made of very diminutive size, to which the\r\nclockmakers gave all sorts of forms, especially those of an acorn, an\r\nalmond, a Latin cross, a shell (Figs. 148 to 150). They were engraved,\r\nchased, enamelled; the hand which marked the hour was very frequently of\r\ndelicate workmanship, and sometimes ornamented with precious stones.\r\nSome of these watches set in motion symbolic figures, as well as Time,\r\nApollo, Diana, the Virgin, the Apostles, and the saints.\r\n\r\nIt may be conceived that all these complicated works required numerous\r\ncraftsmen. It was therefore considered proper to unite these artisans in\r\na community. The statutes which they had received from Louis XI. in 1483\r\nwere confirmed by Francis I. They contained a succession of laws,\r\nintended to protect at the same time the interests of members of the\r\ncorporation and the dignity of their profession.\r\n\r\nNo one was admitted as master but on proof of having served eight years\r\nof apprenticeship, and after having produced a _chef-d’œuvre_ in the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLOCK OF DAMASCENED IRON AND WATCHES Of the Fifteenth and\r\nSixteenth Centuries.]\r\n\r\nhouse, or under the supervision, of one of the inspectors of the\r\ncorporation. The visiting inspectors, elected by all the members, as\r\nwell as by the trustees and the syndics, were authorised when\r\nintroducing themselves into the workshops, to look after the proper\r\nconstruction of watches and clocks; and if it happened that they found\r\nsuch as did not appear to be made according to the rules of art, they\r\ncould not only seize and destroy them, but also impose a fine on the\r\nmaker for the benefit of the corporation. The statutes also gave\r\nexclusive right to the accredited masters to trade, directly or\r\notherwise, with all the stock, new or second-hand, finished or\r\nunfinished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 148 to 150.--Watches of the Valois Epoch.\r\n(Sixteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\n“Under the influence of these wise institutions,” M. Dubois remarks,\r\n“the master-clockmakers had no fear of the competition of persons not\r\nbelonging to the corporation. If they were affected by the artistic\r\nsuperiority of some of their colleagues, it was with the laudable desire\r\nto contend with them for the first places. The work of one day, superior\r\nto that of the preceding, was surpassed by that of the day following. It\r\nwas by this incessant competition of intelligence and knowledge, by this\r\nlegitimate and invigorating rivalry of all the members of the same\r\nindustrious community, that science itself attained by degrees the\r\nzenith of the excellent and the sublime of the beautiful. The ambition\r\nof workmen was to rise to the mastership, and they attained that only by\r\nforce of labour and assiduous efforts. The ambition of the masters was\r\nto acquire the honours of the syndicate--that consular magistracy the\r\nmost honourable of all, for it was the result of election, and the\r\nrecompense of services rendered to art and to the community.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus reached the middle of the sixteenth century, and not wishing\r\nto exceed the compass assigned to this sketch, we may limit ourselves to\r\nthe mention of some of the remarkable works produced during a century by\r\nan art that had already manifested itself with a power never to be\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nThe clock which Henry II. had constructed for the château of Anet has\r\nlong been regarded as very curious. Every time the hand denotes the\r\nhour, a stag appears from the inside of the clock, and darts away\r\nfollowed by a pack of hounds; but soon the pack and the stag stop, and\r\nthe latter, by means of very ingenious mechanism, strikes the hours with\r\none of his feet.\r\n\r\nThe clock of Jena (Fig. 151), which is still in existence, is not less\r\nfamous. Above the dial is a bronze head presumed to represent a buffoon\r\nof Ernest, Elector of Saxony, who died in 1486. When the hour is about\r\nto strike, the head--so remarkably ugly as to have given the clock the\r\nname of the _monstrous head_--opens its very large mouth. A figure\r\nrepresenting an old pilgrim offers it a golden apple on the end of a\r\nstick; but just when poor Hans (so was the fool called) is about to\r\nclose his mouth to masticate and swallow the apple, the pilgrim suddenly\r\nwithdraws it. On the left of the head is an angel singing (the arms of\r\nthe city of Jena), holding in one hand a book, which he raises towards\r\nhis eyes whenever the hours strike, and with the other he rings a\r\nhand-bell.\r\n\r\nThe town of Niort, in Poitou, possessed also an extraordinary clock,\r\nornamented with a great number of allegorical figures--the work of\r\nBouhain,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151.--Clock of Jena, in Germany. (Fifteenth\r\nCentury.)]\r\n\r\nin 1570. A much more famous clock was that of Strasburg (Fig. 152),\r\nconstructed in 1573, and which was long considered to be the greatest of\r\nall wonders. It was entirely restored in 1842 by M. Schwilgué. Angelo\r\nRocca, in his “Commentarium de Campanis,” gives a description of it. Its\r\nmost important feature was a moving sphere, whereon were represented the\r\nplanets and the constellations, and which completed its rotation in\r\nthree hundred and sixty-five days. On two sides of the dial and below it\r\nthe principal festivals of the year and the solemnities of the Church\r\nwere represented by allegorical figures. Other dials, distributed\r\nsymmetrically on the façade of the tower in which the clock is situated,\r\nmarked the days of the week, the date of the month, the signs of the\r\nzodiac, the phases of the moon, the rising and setting of the sun, &c.\r\nEvery hour two angels\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152.--Astronomical Clock of the Cathedral at\r\nStrasburg, constructed in 1573.]\r\n\r\nsounded the trumpet. When the concert was finished, the bell tolled;\r\nthen immediately a cock, perched on the summit, spread his wings\r\nnoisily, and made his crowing to be heard. The striking machinery, by\r\nmeans of movable trap-doors, cylinders, and springs concealed in the\r\ninterior of the clock, set in motion a considerable number of automata,\r\nexecuted with much skill. Angelo Rocca adds that the completion of this\r\n_chef-d’œuvre_ was attributed to Nicolas Copernicus; and that when this\r\nable mechanician had finished his work, the sheriffs and consuls of the\r\ncity had his eyes put out in order to render it impossible for him to\r\nexecute a similar clock for any other city. This last statement is the\r\nmore deserving to rank among mere legends from the fact that,\r\nindependent of existing proof of the clock being made by Conrad\r\nDasypodius, it would be very difficult to prove that Copernicus ever\r\nvisited Alsace, or had his eyes put out.\r\n\r\nA similar tradition is attached to the history of another clock still in\r\nexistence, and which was not less celebrated than that of Strasburg. We\r\nrefer to that of the Church of St. John at Lyons, made in 1598 by\r\nNicholas Lippius, a clockmaker of Basle; repaired and enlarged\r\nsubsequently by Nourisson, an artisan of Lyons. Only the horary\r\nmechanism now acts; but the clock is not on that account neglected by\r\nvisitors, to whom the worthy attendants still repeat, in perfect faith,\r\nthat Lippius was put to death as soon as he had finished his\r\n_chef-d’œuvre_. To show the improbability of this pretended penalty it\r\nis sufficient to remark, with M. Dubois, that even in the sixteenth\r\ncentury persons were not killed for the crime of making _chefs-d’œuvre_;\r\nand there is, besides, proof that Lippius died in peace, and honoured,\r\nin his native country.\r\n\r\nTo these famous clocks must be added those of St. Lambert at Liège, of\r\nNuremberg, of Augsburg, and of Basle; that of Medina del Campo, in\r\nSpain, and those which, in the reign of Charles I., or during the\r\nProtectorship of Cromwell, were manufactured and placed in England, at\r\nSt. Dunstan’s in London,[21] and in the Cathedral of Canterbury, in\r\nEdinburgh, and in Glasgow, &c.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding, and to do justice to a century to which we have\r\nassigned a period of decline, we are bound to acknowledge that some\r\nyears before the death of Cardinal Richelieu--that is to say, from 1630\r\nto 1640--artists of ability made praiseworthy efforts to create a new\r\nera in horology. But the improvements they had in view were directed\r\nmuch more to the processes of the construction of the several parts\r\ncomposing the clockwork of watches and clocks than to the beauty and\r\ningenuity of the workmanship. This was progress of a purely professional\r\ncharacter, in order to create a more ready and inexpensive supply; a\r\nprogress which we may regard as services rendered by art to trade. The\r\nperiod of great constructions and delicate marvels was past. Ornamental\r\n_Jacquemarts_ were no longer placed in belfries. Mechanical\r\n_chefs-d’œuvre_ were no longer set in frail gems. The time was still far\r\noff when, laying down the sceptre of that empire on which “the sun never\r\nsets,” the conqueror of Francis I., retiring to a cloister, employed\r\nhimself in the construction of the most complicated clockwork. Charles\r\nV. had as assistant, if not as teacher, in his work the learned\r\nmathematician, Jannellus Turianus, whom he had induced to join him in\r\nhis retreat. It is said that he enjoyed nothing so much as seeing the\r\nmonks of Saint-Just standing amazed before his alarum watches and\r\nautomaton clocks; but it is also stated that he manifested the greatest\r\ndespair when obliged to admit it was as impossible to establish perfect\r\nconcord among clocks as among men.\r\n\r\nIn truth, Galileo had not yet arrived to observe and formulate the laws\r\nof the pendulum, which Huygens was happily to apply to the movements of\r\nhorology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153.--Top of an Hour-Glass, engraved and gilt.

In the sixth century, Isidore of Seville, in his\r\n“Sentiments sur la Musique,” writes as follows:--“Music is a modulation\r\nof the voice, and also an accordance of several sounds and their\r\nsimultaneous union.”\r\n\r\nAbout 384, St. Ambrose, who built the Cathedral of Milan, regulated the\r\nmode in which psalms, hymns, and anthems should be performed, by\r\nselecting from Greek chants those melodies he considered best adapted to\r\nthe Latin Church.\r\n\r\nIn 590, Gregory the Great, in order to remedy the disorder which had\r\ncrept into ecclesiastical singing, collected all that remained of the\r\nancient Greek melodies, with those of St. Ambrose and others, and formed\r\nthe antiphonary which is called the _Centonien_, because it is composed\r\nof chants of his selection. Henceforward, ecclesiastical chanting\r\nobtained the name of _Gregorian_; it was adopted into the whole of the\r\nWestern Church, and maintained its position almost unaltered down to the\r\nmiddle of the eleventh century.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that originally the music of the antiphonary was noted in\r\naccordance with Greek and Roman usage--a notation known as the\r\n_Boethian_, from the name of Boethius the philosopher, by whom we are\r\ninformed that in his time (that is, about the end of the fifth century)\r\nthe notation was composed of the first fifteen letters of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nThe sounds of the octave were represented--the major by _capital_\r\nletters, the minor by _small_ letters, as follows:--\r\n\r\nMajor mode      A    B    C   D    E    F    G\r\nMinor mode      a    b    c   d    e    f    g\r\n\r\nSome fragments of music of the eleventh century are still preserved, in\r\nwhich the notation is represented by letters having above them the signs\r\nof another kind of notation called _neumes_ (Fig. 154).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154.--Lament composed shortly after the Death of\r\nCharlemagne, probably about 814 or 815, and attributed to Colomban,\r\nAbbot of Saint-Tron.

Certain modifications in\r\nthem were introduced by the Lombards and Saxons.\r\n\r\n“They were specially in use from the eighth to the twelfth century,”\r\nsays M. Coussemaker, in his learned work, “Histoire de l’Harmonie au\r\nMoyen Age,” “and consisted of two sorts of signs: some formed like\r\ncommas, dots, or small inclined or horizontal strokes, which represented\r\nisolated sounds; others in the shape of hooks, and strokes variously\r\ntwisted and joined, expressing groups of sound composed of various\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\n“These commas, dots, and inclined or horizontal strokes were the origin\r\nof the long notes, the breve and the semibreve, and afterwards of the\r\nsquare notation still in use in the _plain-chant_ of the Church. The\r\nhook-shaped signs and the variously twisted and joined strokes gave rise\r\nto the ligatures and connections of notes.\r\n\r\n“From the eighth to the end of the twelfth century--that is, during one\r\nof the brightest periods of musical liturgy--the _neumes_ were the\r\nnotation exclusively adopted over the whole of Europe, both in\r\necclesiastical singing and also in secular music. From the end of the\r\neleventh century, this system of notation was established in France,\r\nItaly, Germany, England, and Spain.”\r\n\r\nThe chief modification to which the notation of music was subject at the\r\nend of the eleventh century is due to the monk Guido, of Arezzo. In\r\norder to facilitate the reading of the _neumes_, he invented placing\r\nthem on lines, and these lines he distinguished by colours. The second,\r\nthat of the _fa_, was red; the fourth, that of the _ut_, was green; the\r\nfirst and the third are only traced on the vellum with a pen. In order\r\nthat the seven notes should be better impressed upon the memory, he gave\r\nas an example the three first lines of the Hymn of St. John the Baptist,\r\nin which the syllables _ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la_, corresponded to the\r\nsigns of the gamut:--\r\n\r\n   “_Ut_ queant laxis _Re_sonare fibris\r\n    _Mi_ra gestorum _Fa_muli tuorum,\r\n    _Sol_ve polluti _La_bii reatum,\r\n    Sancte Joannes.”\r\n\r\nThe choristers, in singing this hymn, slightly raised the intonation of\r\neach of the italicised syllables, which were soon adopted for indicating\r\nsix of the notes of the gamut. To supply the seventh, which was not\r\nnamed in this system, the barbarous theory of _muances_ (divisions) was\r\nintroduced, and it was not until the seventeenth century the term _si_\r\nwas applied in France.\r\n\r\nBut after the commencement of the tenth century many individuals, and\r\nespecially poets, had invented rhythmical songs, which were entirely\r\ndifferent from those of the Church. “Harmony formed by successions of\r\nvarious intervals,” as we are told by the author whom we have before\r\nquoted, “obtained in the eleventh century the name of _discantus_, in\r\nold French _déchant_. Francon de Cologne is the most ancient author who\r\nmakes use of this word. During the whole course of the eleventh century\r\nthe composition of melody was independent of harmony, and henceforth the\r\ncomposition of music was divided into two very distinct parts. The\r\npeople, and poets and persons in high life, constructed the melody and\r\nthe words; but being ignorant of the science of music, they resorted to\r\na professional musician to have their inspirations written down. The\r\nfirst were very justly called _trouvères_ (_trobadori_), the others the\r\n_déchanteurs_, or harmonisers. Harmony was then only adapted for two\r\nvoices--a combination of fifths, and of movements in unison.\r\n\r\n“In the twelfth century, the construction of melody continued to be in\r\nthe hands of poets. The _déchanteurs_ or harmonisers were the\r\nprofessional musicians. Popular songs became very numerous. Troubadours\r\nmultiplied all over Europe, and the greatest lords deemed it an honour\r\nto cultivate both poetry and music. Germany had her ‘master-singers,’\r\nwho were in request at every court. In France, the Châtelain de Coucy,\r\nthe King of Navarre, the Comte de Béthune, the Comte d’Anjou, and a\r\nhundred others acquired a brilliant reputation by songs, of which they\r\ncomposed both the words and the melody. The most celebrated of these\r\n_trouvères_ was Adam de la Halle, who flourished in 1260.”\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century, the name of _counterpoint_ was substituted\r\nfor that of _déchant_; and in 1364, at the coronation of Charles V. at\r\nRheims, a mass was sung which was written in four parts, composed by\r\nGuillaume de Machault, poet and musician.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients the number of musical instruments was considerable,\r\nbut their names were even still more numerous, because derived from the\r\nshape, the material, the nature and character of the instruments, all of\r\nwhich varied infinitely, according to the whim of the maker or the\r\nmusician. Added to this, every country had its national instruments; and\r\nas each in its own language designated them by descriptive names, the\r\nsame instrument appeared under ten different denominations, and a\r\nsimilar name was applied to ten instruments. However, having nothing but\r\nmonumental representation to guide us, and in the absence of the\r\ninstruments themselves, an almost inextricable confusion arises.\r\n\r\nThe Romans carried back to their own country, as the results of\r\nconquest, specimens of most of the musical instruments they found in use\r\nin the countries subdued by them. Thus Greece supplied Rome with nearly\r\nall the soft instruments of the class of lyres and flutes. Germany and\r\nthe northern provinces, being inhabited by warlike races, gave to their\r\nconquerors the taste for loud-sounding instruments, such as trumpets and\r\ndrums. Asia, and Judæa especially, which had multiplied various kinds of\r\nmetal-instruments for use in their religious ceremonies, were the means\r\nof naturalising in Roman music deep-toned instruments of the class of\r\nbells and tom-toms (a kind of drum). Egypt introduced into Italy the\r\ntimbrel along with the worship of Isis. Byzantium had no sooner invented\r\nthe first pneumatic organs than the new religion of Christ took\r\npossession of them for exclusive consecration to its service, both in\r\nthe East and in the West.\r\n\r\nAll the musical instruments of the known world had therefore taken\r\nrefuge, as it were, in the capital of the Roman empire; but their fate\r\nwas only to disappear and sink into oblivion after they had played their\r\npart in the last pomps of that falling empire, and in the final\r\nfestivals of the ancient mythology. In a letter in which he specially\r\ntreats of “various kinds of musical instruments,” St. Jerome, who lived\r\nfrom 331 to 420, speaks of those which were in use in his time for the\r\nrequirements of religion, war, ceremonial, and art. He mentions, in the\r\nfirst place, the organ, and describes it as composed of fifteen brazen\r\npipes, two air-reservoirs of elephant’s skin, and twelve large sets of\r\nbellows, “to imitate the voice of thunder.” He next specifies, under the\r\ngeneric name of _tuba_, several kinds of trumpets: that which called the\r\npeople together, that which directed the march of troops, that which\r\nproclaimed the victory, that which sounded the charge against the enemy,\r\nthat which announced the closing of the gates, &c. One of these\r\ntrumpets, the shape of which is rather difficult to gather from his\r\ndescription, had three brazen bells, and _roared through four\r\nair-conduits_. Another instrument, the _bombulum_, which must have made\r\na frightful uproar, was, as far as we can conjecture from the text of\r\nthe pious writer, a kind of peal of bells attached to a hollow metallic\r\ncolumn which, by the assistance of twelve pipes, reverberated the sounds\r\nof twenty-four bells that were set in motion by one another. Next come\r\nthe _cithara_ of the Hebrews, in the shape of a triangle, furnished with\r\ntwenty-four strings; the sackbut, of Chaldæan origin, a trumpet formed\r\nof several movable tubes of wood, fitting one into the other; the\r\npsaltery, a small harp provided with ten strings; and lastly, the\r\n_tympanum_, also called the _chorus_, a hand-drum to which were fixed\r\ntwo metal flute-tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155.--Concert; a Bas-relief, taken from a Capital in\r\nSaint-Georges de Boscherville, Normandy. (A Work of the Eleventh\r\nCentury.)]\r\n\r\nA nomenclature of a similar kind, applying to the ninth century, exists\r\nin a history of Charlemagne, in Latin verse, by Aymeric de Peyrac. This\r\nshows as that, during the lapse of four centuries, the number of\r\ninstruments had been nearly doubled, and that the musical influence of\r\nCharlemagne’s reign had made itself felt in the revival and improvement\r\nof several instruments which had been formerly abandoned. This curious\r\nmetrical composition enumerates all the stringed, wind, and pulsatile\r\ninstruments which celebrated the praise of the great emperor, the\r\nprotector and restorer of music. The number of instruments specified\r\nare twenty-four in number, among which we find nearly all those\r\nmentioned by St. Jerome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156.--Concert and Musical Instruments. From a\r\nMiniature in a Manuscript of the Thirteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nThe names, therefore, of musical instruments had passed through seven or\r\neight centuries without undergoing any kind of change than that\r\nnaturally resulting from variations in the language. But the instruments\r\nthemselves, during this long interval of time, had been often modified\r\nto such extent that the primitive denomination not unfrequently appeared\r\nto contradict the musical characteristics of the instrument to which it\r\nstill continued to be attached. Thus, the _chorus_, which had been a\r\nfour-stringed harp, and from its name seems to indicate a collection of\r\ninstruments, had become a wind-instrument.[22] So also the psaltery,\r\nwhich was originally touched by a _plectrum_ (stick) or with the\r\nfingers, now only gave forth its notes under the influence of a bow; an\r\ninstrument that had had twenty strings now only retained eight; another,\r\nthe name of which seemed to refer to a square shape, was rounded; those\r\nprimitively made of wood were now constructed of metal. There is reason\r\nto believe that, generally speaking, these changes were made not so much\r\nwith the view of any musical improvement, properly so called, as with an\r\nidea of gratifying the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157.--The Tree of Jesse. The ancestors of Jesus\r\nChrist are represented with Musical Instruments, and as forming a\r\nCelestial Concert. (Fac-simile from a Miniature in a Manuscript Breviary\r\nof the Fifteenth Century. Royal Library, Brussels.)]\r\n\r\nfancy of the eye (Figs. 155 to 157). Scarcely any fixed rules for the\r\nconstruction of musical instruments existed before the sixteenth\r\ncentury, when learned musicians applied mathematical principles to the\r\ntheory of manufacture. Down to 1589 musical instruments were made in\r\nParis by workmen who were organ-makers, lute-makers, or even\r\ncoppersmiths, under the inspection and guarantee of the community of\r\nmusicians; but at this epoch the makers of musical instruments were\r\nunited in a trade corporation, and obtained, through the goodwill of\r\nHenry III., certain privileges and special statutes.\r\n\r\nAs musical instruments have always been divided into three particular\r\nclasses,--stringed, pulsatile, and wind instruments,--we shall adopt\r\nthis natural division in passing under review the various kinds in use\r\nduring the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. We shall not, however,\r\npretend to be always able to point out the precise musical value of\r\nthese instruments, for in several instances we have no knowledge of\r\nthem, except from representations more or less truthful.\r\n\r\nThe class of wind instruments comprised flutes, trumpets, and organs;\r\neach of these was, however, subdivided into several very distinct kinds.\r\nIn the division of flutes alone, for instance, we find the straight\r\nflute, the double flute, the side-mouthed or German flute, the Pandean\r\npipes, the _chorus_, the _calamus_, the bagpipes (_muse_ or _mousette_),\r\nthe _doucine_ or hautboy, the _flaïos_ or flageolet, &c.\r\n\r\nThe flute is the most ancient of musical instruments; even in the Middle\r\nAges no orchestra was considered complete which did not contain an\r\nentire order of flutes, differing both in shape and tone. In principle,\r\nthe simple flute, or _flûte à bec_, consisted of a straight pipe of hard\r\nand sounding wood, made in one piece, and pierced with four or six\r\nholes. But the number of holes being successively increased to eleven,\r\nand the pipe being enlarged to a length of seven or eight feet, the\r\nresult was that the fingers were unable to act simultaneously upon all\r\nthe openings; thus, in order to close the two holes farthest from the\r\nmouthpiece, keys were attached to the body of the flute which the\r\ninstrumentalist acted on with his foot.\r\n\r\nThe simple flute, of greater or less length, is seen on the figured\r\nmonuments of every epoch. The double flute, which was equally in use,\r\nhad, as its name indicates, two pipes, generally of unequal lengths; the\r\n_left-hand_ tube, which was the shortest and therefore called the\r\n_feminine_, produced shrill sounds, while the _right-hand_, or\r\n_masculine_, gave the low notes. Whether these two tubes were united or\r\nwere separate, this flute had always two distinct mouths,--although they\r\nwere often very close together--on which the musician played\r\nalternately. The double flute (Fig. 158) was the instrument employed in\r\nthe eleventh century by the _jongleurs_ or jugglers as an\r\naccompaniment.\r\n\r\nThe side-mouthed flute, which was at first very little used, owed its\r\ncelebrity in the sixteenth century to the improvements it received from\r\nthe Germans, hence it acquired the name of the _German flute_ (Fig.\r\n160).\r\n\r\nThe _syrinx_ was nothing but the ancient Pandean pipes, composed\r\ngenerally of seven tubes of wood or metal, gradually decreasing in\r\nlength; they were closed at the bottom, and at the top took the form of\r\na horizontal plane, which was touched by the lip of the musician as it\r\npassed along (Fig. 159). In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the\r\nsyrinx, which must have produced very shrill and discordant music, was\r\ngenerally made in the shape of a semicircle, and contained nine tubes in\r\na metallic case pierced with the same number of holes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158.--Double Flute, Fourteenth Century. (From\r\nWillemin’s “French Monuments.”)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159.--Seven-tubed _Syrinx_, Ninth or Tenth Century.\r\n(Angers MS.)]\r\n\r\nThe _chorus_, which in the time of St. Jerome was composed of a skin and\r\ntwo tubes, one forming the mouth, the other the bell-end (Fig. 161),\r\nmust have presented a very great similarity to the modern bagpipes. In\r\nthe ninth century its shape had changed but little, except that we\r\nsometimes find two bell-ends, and the membranous air-reservoir is in\r\nsome examples replaced by a kind of case made of metal or resonant wood\r\n(_bois sonore_). Subsequently this instrument was transformed into a\r\nsimple dulcimer.\r\n\r\nThe _calamus_, called the _chalemelle_ or _chalemie_, which derived its\r\norigin from the _calamus_ or reed-pipe of the ancients, became in the\r\nsixteenth century a treble to the hautboy, the _bombarde_ being its\r\ncounter-bass and tenor, and the bass being executed on the _cromorne_.\r\nThere was, however, quite a group of hautboys. The _douçaine_ or\r\n_doucine_, a soft flute, the great hautboy of Poitou played the parts of\r\ntenor or of fifth. The length of the hautboy having been found\r\ninconvenient, it was divided into pieces united in a movable cluster\r\n(_faisceau_) known by the name of _fagot_. This instrument was\r\nafterwards called _courtaut_ in France, and _sourdeline_ or _sampogne_\r\nin Italy, where it had become a kind of bagpipe, like the _muse_ or\r\n_estive_. The _muse de blé_ was a simple reed-pipe, but the _muse\r\nd’Aussay_ (or _d’Ausçois_, district of Auch) was certainty a hautboy.\r\nWith regard to the bagpipes, properly so called, they generally bore the\r\nname of _chevrette_, _chevrie_, or _chièvre_, on account of the skin of\r\nwhich the bag was made. They were also designated by the names of\r\n_pythaule_ and _cornemuse_, drone-pipe (Fig. 162).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160.--German Musicians playing on the Flute and\r\nGoat’s Horn. (Drawn and Engraved by J. Amman.)]\r\n\r\nThe _flaïos de saus_, or reed-flutes, were nothing but mere whistles,\r\nsuch as village children are still in the habit of making in the spring;\r\nbut there were, says an ancient author, more than twenty kinds, “as many\r\nloud as soft,” which were coupled by pairs in an orchestra. The\r\n_fistule_, the _souffle_, the _pipe_, and the _fretiau_ or _galoubet_,\r\nwere all small flageolets played on by the left hand while the right\r\nmarked the time on a tambourine or with the cymbals. The _pandorium_,\r\nwhich has been classed among the flutes without its shape and character\r\nof tone being rightly determined, must have presented, at least at its\r\norigin, some similarity of sound to the stringed instrument called\r\n_pandore_ (_pandora_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161.--_Chorus_ with single Bell-end with Holes.\r\n(Ninth Century, MS. of Saint-Blaise.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162.--Bagpiper, Thirteenth Century. (Sculpture on\r\nthe Musicians’ Hall at Rheims.)]\r\n\r\nTrumpets formed a much more numerous class than the flutes. In Latin\r\nthey were called _tuba_, _lituus_, _buccina_, _taurea_, _cornu_,\r\n_claro_, _salpinx_, &c.; in French, _trompe_, _corne_, _olifant_,\r\n_cornet_, _buisine_, _sambute_, &c. In most cases, however, they derived\r\ntheir name either from their shape, the sound which they produced, the\r\nmaterial whereof they were made, or the use for which they were\r\nspecially intended. Thus, among military trumpets of copper or brass,\r\nthe names of some (_claro_, _clarasius_) indicating the piercing sound\r\nwhich they produced; the names of others seem rather to refer to the\r\nappearance of their bell-ends (Fig. 164), which imitated the head of a\r\nbird, a horn, a serpent, &c. Some of these trumpets were so long and\r\nheavy that a foot or stand was required to support them, while the\r\nperformer took the end in his mouth and blew through it with full power\r\nof breath (Fig. 163.)\r\n\r\nThe shepherds’ horns, made of wood rimmed with brass, were a heavy and\r\npowerful kind of speaking-trumpet, which in the eighth century the Welsh\r\nherdsmen and those of the _landes_ of Cornouaille always carried with\r\nthem (Fig. 165.) When the barons or knights desired to convey any\r\nsignals rendered necessary either in war or hunting, they were in the\r\nhabit of using horns of a much more portable character, which were\r\nsuspended at their girdles; they used them, also, as drinking vessels\r\nwhen occasion required. At first these instruments were generally made\r\nof nothing but buffalo’s or goat’s horns; but when the fashion arose of\r\nworking delicately in ivory, they took the name of _olifant_, an\r\nappellation destined to become famous in the old romances of chivalry,\r\nin which the _olifant_ played a very important part (Fig. 166). To cite\r\nonly one example among a thousand, Roland, when overwhelmed by numbers\r\nin the valley of Ronceveaux, sounded the _olifant_ in order to call\r\nCharlemagne’s army to his aid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163.--Straight Trumpet with Stand. (Eleventh\r\nCentury. Cotton MS., British Museum.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164.--Curved Trumpet. (Eleventh Century. Cotton MS.,\r\nBritish Museum.)]\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century, according to a passage in a manuscript in the\r\nLibrary of Berne, quoted by M. Jubinal, there were in bodies of troops\r\n_corneurs_, _trompeurs_, and _buisineurs_, who played under certain\r\nspecial circumstances. The _trompes_ sounded for the movements of the\r\nknights, or men-at-arms; the _cornes_ for the movements of the banners\r\nor the foot-soldiers, and the _buisines_, or clarions, when the entire\r\ncamp (_ost_) was to march. The heralds-at-arms, whose duty it was to\r\nmake the announcements or proclamations in the public ways, were in the\r\nhabit of using either long trumpets, called _à potence_, on account of\r\nthe forked stick whereon they were supported, or trumpets _à tortilles_\r\n(serpentine), the name of which sufficiently indicates their shape.\r\nAdded to this, the sound of the trumpet or horn accompanied or\r\nsignalised the principal acts of the citizens both in public and private\r\nlife. During the meals of great men, the water, the wine, and the bread,\r\nwere heralded by sound of trumpet. In towns this instrument announced\r\nthe opening and closing of the gates, the opening and closing of the\r\nmarkets, and the time of curfew, till the time when the horn and the\r\ncopper trumpet were superseded in this function by the bells in\r\nchurch-towers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 165.--Shepherd’s Horn. Eighth Century. (MS., British\r\nMuseum.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166.--Horn, or _Olifant_, Fourteenth Century. (From\r\nWillemin’s “French Monuments.”)]\r\n\r\nPolybius and Ammianus Marcellinus tell us that the ancient Gauls and\r\nGermans had a great passion for large, hoarse-sounding trumpets. At the\r\ntime of Charlemagne, and still more in the days of the Crusades, the\r\nintercourse that took place between the men of the West and the African\r\nand Asiatic races introduced among the former the use of musical\r\ninstruments of a harsh and piercing tone. Then it was that the\r\nSaracen-horns, made of copper, replaced the wooden or horn trumpets. At\r\nthe same period sackbuts, or _sambutes_ (Fig. 167), made their\r\nappearance in Italy: in those of the ninth century, we find the\r\nprinciple of the modern trombone. About the same epoch the Germans\r\nintroduced great improvements into the trumpet by adapting to it the\r\nsystem of holes, which up to that time had been the characteristic of\r\nflutes (Fig. 168).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167.--_Sambute_, or Sackbut, of the Ninth Century.\r\n(Boulogne MS.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168.--German Musician sounding the Military Trumpet.\r\nDrawn and Engraved by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nBut among all the wind instruments of the Middle Ages, the organ was the\r\none most imposing in its nature, and destined to the most glorious\r\ncareer. The only instrument of this kind known by the ancients was the\r\nwater-organ, in which a key-board of twenty-six keys corresponded to the\r\nsame number of pipes; and the air, acted upon by the pressure of water,\r\nproduced most varied sounds. Nero, it is said, spent a whole day\r\nexamining and admiring the mechanism of an instrument of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe water-organ, although described and commended by Vitruvius, was not\r\nmuch in use in the Middle Ages. Eginhard speaks of one constructed, in\r\n826, by a Venetian priest; and the last of which mention is made existed\r\nat Malmesbury in the twelfth century. But this latter might be regarded\r\nmore in the light of a steam-organ; for, like the warning whistles of\r\nour locomotives, it was worked by the effects of the steam of boiling\r\nwater rushing into brass pipes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169.--Pneumatic Organ of the Fourth Century.\r\n(Sculpture of that date at Constantinople.)]\r\n\r\nThe water-organ was, in very early times, superseded by the pneumatic or\r\nwind-organ (Fig. 169), the description of which given by St. Jerome\r\nagrees with the representations on the obelisk erected at Constantinople\r\nin the time of Theodosius the Great. We must, however, fix a date as\r\nlate as the eighth century for the introduction of this instrument into\r\nthe West, or at least into France. In 757, Constantine Copronymus,\r\nEmperor of the East, sent to King Pépin a number of presents, among\r\nwhich was an organ that excited the admiration of the court.\r\nCharlemagne, who received a similar present from the same monarch, had\r\nseveral organs made from this model. These were provided, according to\r\nthe statement of the monk of Saint-Gall, with “brazen pipes which were\r\nacted on by bellows made of bull’s hide, and imitated the roaring of\r\nthunder, the accents of the lyre, and the clang of cymbals.” These\r\nprimitive organs, notwithstanding the power and richness of their\r\nmusical resources, were of dimensions which rendered them quite\r\nportable. It was, in fact, only in consequence of its almost exclusive\r\napplication to the solemnities of Catholic worship that the organ became\r\ndeveloped on an almost gigantic scale. In 951, there existed in\r\nWinchester Cathedral an organ which was divided into two parts, each\r\nprovided with its apparatus of bellows, its key-board, and its\r\norganist. Twelve bellows above, and fourteen below, were worked by\r\nseventy strong men, and the air was distributed by means of forty valves\r\ninto four hundred pipes, arranged in groups or choirs of ten, each group\r\ncorresponding with one of the twenty-four keys of each key-board (Fig.\r\n170).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170.--Great Organ, with Bellows and double\r\nKey-board, of the Twelfth Century. (MS. at Cambridge.)]\r\n\r\nIn the ninth century, the German organ-makers acquired great renown. The\r\nmonk Gerbert, who, as we have already remarked, became pope under the\r\nname of Sylvester II., and co-operated so efficiently in the progress of\r\nthe horological art, established in the monastery of which he was abbot\r\na workshop for the manufacture of organs. We must add, that all the\r\nmusical treatises written from the ninth to the twelfth century entered\r\ninto very considerable details concerning the arrangement and working of\r\nthis instrument. Nevertheless, the admission of the organ into churches\r\ndid not fail to meet with earnest opponents among the bishops and\r\npriests of the day. But while some complained of the thunder and\r\nrumbling of the organs, others appealed to the examples of king David\r\nand the prophet Elisha. Finally, in the thirteenth century, the right of\r\nplacing organs in all churches was no longer disputed, and the only\r\nquestion was, who could build the most powerful and most magnificent\r\ninstruments. At Milan was an organ the pipes of which were of silver; at\r\nVenice some were made of pure gold. The number of these pipes was varied\r\nand multiplied to an infinite extent, according to the effects the\r\ninstrument was required to produce. The mechanism was, generally\r\nspeaking, rather complicated, and the working of the bellows very\r\nlaborious. In large organs the key-board was made up of key-plates five\r\nor six inches wide, which the organist, his hands defended by thickly\r\npadded gloves, had to strike with his clenched fist in order to bring\r\nout the notes (Fig. 171).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171.--Organ with single Key-board of the Fourteenth\r\nCentury. (Miniature from a Latin Psalter, No. 175, Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nThe organ, which, as we have seen, was at first of a portable nature, in\r\nsome cases resumed its original dimensions (Fig. 172). It was then\r\nsometimes called simply _portatif_ (hand-organ), and sometimes _régale_\r\nor _positif_ (choir-organ). Raphael, in one of his famous pictures,\r\nrepresents St. Cecilia singing sacred hymns, and accompanying herself on\r\na choir-organ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172.--Portable Organ of the Fifteenth Century.\r\n(Miniature in Vincent de Beauvais’ “Miroir Historial,” MS. in the Bibl.\r\nImp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nThe class of pulsatile instruments was formed of bells, cymbals, and\r\ndrums.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173.--_Tintinnabulum_ or Hand-Bell of the Ninth\r\nCentury. (Boulogne MS.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174.--The _Saufang_ of St. Cecilia’s at Cologne.\r\n(Sixth Century.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175.--Bell in a Tower of Siena. (Twelfth Century.)]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the ancients were acquainted with large\r\nbells, hand-bells, and strung-bells (_grelots_). But we must ascribe to\r\nthe requirements of Christian worship the first introduction of the\r\nbell, properly so called, formed of cast-metal (_campana_ or _nola_, the\r\nfirst having been made, it is said, at Nola), which was employed from\r\nthe first in summoning the faithful to the public services. In the first\r\ninstance the bell was merely held in the hand and shaken by some monk or\r\necclesiastic who stood in front of the church-door, or mounted a raised\r\nplatform for the purpose. This _tintinnabulum_ (Fig. 173), or portable\r\nbell, subsequently passed into the hands of the public criers, the\r\nsocieties of ringers, and those who rang knells for the dead, at a time\r\nwhen most of the churches were provided with _campaniles_ or\r\nbell-towers, wherein were hung the parish bells, which daily assumed\r\ndimensions of increasing importance. These great bells, of which the\r\n_Saufang_ of Cologne (sixth century) is an example (Fig. 174), were at\r\nfirst made of wrought-iron plates laid one over the other, and riveted\r\ntogether. But in the eighth century they began to cast bells of copper\r\nand even of silver. One of the most ancient still existing is that in\r\nthe tower of Bisdomini at Siena (Fig. 175). It bears the date of 1159,\r\nand is formed in the shape of a cask, being rather more than a yard\r\nhigh: the sound it produces is very sharp. The combination of several\r\nbells of various sizes naturally produced the peal or chime; this at\r\nfirst consisted of an arch of wood or iron whereon were suspended the\r\nbells, which the player struck with a small hammer (Fig. 176). The\r\nnumber and classification of the bells becoming subsequently rather more\r\ncomplicated, the hand of the chimer was superseded by a mechanical\r\narrangement. This was the origin of those peals of bells for which there\r\nwas such a demand in the Middle Ages, and of which certain towns are\r\nstill so proud.\r\n\r\nThe designations of _cymbalum_ and _flagellum_ were, in the first\r\ninstance, applied to small hand-chimes; but there were also regular\r\ncymbals (_cymbala_ or _acetabula_), spherical or hollowed plates of\r\nsilver, brass, or copper. Some of these were shaken at the ends of the\r\nfingers, or fastened to the knees or feet, so as to be put in motion by\r\nthe movement of the body. These small cymbals, or _crotales_, were a\r\nkind of rattle (_grelots_), causing the dancers to make a noise in their\r\nperformance, as do the Spanish castanets, which in the sixteenth century\r\nwere called in France _maronnettes_, and were the same as the\r\n_cliquettes_, or snappers, used by lepers in former days. Small\r\nstrung-bells became so much the fashion at a certain epoch that not only\r\nwas the harness of horses adorned with them, but they were suspended to\r\nthe clothes both of men and women, who at the slightest movement made a\r\nringing, tinkling noise, sounding like so many perambulating chimes.\r\n\r\nThe use of pulsatile instruments producing a metallic sound increased\r\ngreatly in Europe, especially after the return from the Crusades. But\r\neven before this date the Egyptian timbrel was used in religious and\r\nfestival music; this instrument was composed of a circle whereon rings\r\nwere hung, which tinkled as they struck together when the timbrel was\r\nshaken. The Oriental triangle was also used on these occasions; this was\r\nalmost the same then as it is at the present day.\r\n\r\nThe drum has always been a hollow case covered with a stretched skin,\r\nbut the shape and size of this instrument have caused great variations\r\nin its name, and also in the way in which it was used. In the Middle\r\nAges it was called _taborellus_, _tabornum_, and _tympanum_. It\r\ngenerally made its appearance in festal music, and especially in\r\nprocessions; but it was not until the fourteenth century that it began\r\nto take a place in military bands, at least in France; the Arabians,\r\nhowever, have used it from the earliest ages. In the thirteenth century\r\nthe _taburel_ was a kind of tambourine, played on with only a\r\ndrum-stick; in the _tabornum_ we may recognise the military drum of the\r\npresent day; and the _tympanum_ was equivalent to our tambourine.\r\nSometimes, as seen in a sculpture in the Musicians’ Hall at Rheims, this\r\ninstrument was attached to the right shoulder of the performer, who\r\nplayed upon it by striking it with his head, while at the same time he\r\nblew through two metal flutes communicating with the inside of the drum\r\n(Fig. 177).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176.--Chime of Bells of the Ninth Century. (MS. de\r\nSaint-Blaise.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177.--_Tympanum_ of the Thirteenth Century.\r\n(Sculpture on the Musicians’ Hall, Rheims.)]\r\n\r\nWe have now to speak of stringed instruments, the whole of which may be\r\ndivided into three principal classes: those played on by the fingers,\r\nthose that are struck, and those which are rubbed (_frottées_) by means\r\nof some appliance.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, there are some stringed instruments which may be\r\nsaid to belong to all three of these classes, as all three modes of\r\nplaying upon them has been adopted either simultaneously or in\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient are doubtless those that are played on by the fingers,\r\nfirst among which, in right of its antiquity, we must name the lyre;\r\nfrom this have sprung the cithern, the harp, the psaltery, the\r\n_nabulon_, &c. In the Middle Ages, however, considerable confusion arose\r\nfrom the fact that these original names were at the time often diverted\r\nfrom their real acceptation.\r\n\r\nThe lyre, the stringed instrument _par excellence_ of the Greeks and\r\nRomans, preserved its primitive form as late as the tenth century. The\r\nstrings were generally of twisted gut, but sometimes also of brass wire,\r\nand varied in number from three to eight. The sounding-box, which was\r\nalways placed at the lower part of the instrument, was more often made\r\nof wood than of either metal or tortoise-shell (Fig. 178).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178.--Ancient Lyre. (Angers MS.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179.--Lyre of the North. (Ninth Century.)]\r\n\r\nThe lyre was held upon the knees, and the performer touched or rubbed\r\nthe strings with one hand, either with the fingers or by means of a\r\n_plectrum_. The lyre specified as “Northern” (Fig. 179), was certainly\r\nthe origin of the violin, to the shape of which it even then bore some\r\nresemblance; it was fastened at the top, and had a _cordier_ at the end\r\nof the sounding-board, as well as a bridge in the centre of the face of\r\nthe instrument.\r\n\r\nThe lyre was superseded by the psaltery and the cithern. The psaltery,\r\nwhich never was furnished with fewer than ten, or more than twenty,\r\nstrings, differed essentially from the lyre and the cithern by the\r\nsounding-board being placed at the top of the instrument. Psalteries\r\nwere made of a round, square, oblong, or buckler-shaped form (Fig. 181);\r\nand sometimes the sounding-box was lengthened so as to rest upon the\r\nshoulder of the musician (Fig. 180). The psaltery disappeared in the\r\ntenth century and gave place to the cithern (_cithara_), a name which\r\nhad been at first applied to all kinds of stringed instruments. The\r\nshape of the cithern, which in the days of St. Jerome resembled a Greek\r\n_delta_ (Δ), varied in different countries, as is proved by the\r\nepithets--_barbarica_, _Teutonica_, _Anglica_, which we find at\r\ndifferent times coupled with its generic name. In other places, in\r\nconsequence of these local transformations, it became the _nabulum_, the\r\n_chorus_, and the _salterion_ or _psalterion_ (which latter must not be\r\nconfounded with the psaltery, a primary derivative of the lyre).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180.--Psaltery to produce a prolonged sound. Ninth\r\nCentury. (MS. in the Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nThe _nabulum_[23] (Fig. 182) was made either in the shape of a triangle\r\nwith truncated corners, or of a semicircle joined at the two\r\nextremities; its sounding-board occupied the whole of the rounded part,\r\nand left but a very limited space for the twelve strings. The _chorus_\r\nor _choron_, the imperfect representation of which in the manuscripts of\r\nthe ninth and tenth centuries calls to mind the appearance of a long\r\nsemicircular window or of a Gothic capital N, generally had one of its\r\nsides prolonged, on which the performer leaned so as to hold the\r\ninstrument in the same way as a harp (Fig. 183).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181.--Buckler-shaped Psaltery with many Strings.\r\n(Ninth Century. Boulogne MS.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182.--_Nabulum._ Ninth Century. (MS. d’Angers.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183.--_Choron._ Ninth Century. (Boulogne MS.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184.--_Psalterion._ Twelfth Century.]\r\n\r\nThe _psalterion_, which was in use all over Europe after the twelfth\r\ncentury, and is thought to have originated in the East, where it was\r\nfound by the Crusaders, was at first composed of a flat box of sounding\r\nwood, with two oblique sides; it assumed the shape of a triangle\r\ntruncated at its top, with twelve or sixteen metallic strings either of\r\ngold or silver, which were played upon by means of a small bow of wood,\r\nivory, or horn (Fig. 184); subsequently the strings were made more\r\nslender, the number being increased to as many as twenty-two; the three\r\nangles of the sounding-box were cut off, and holes were made, sometimes\r\none only in the middle, sometimes one at each angle, and sometimes as\r\nmany as five, symmetrically arranged. The performer placed the\r\ninstrument against his chest, and held it so as to touch the strings\r\neither with the fingers of the two hands, or with a pen or _plectrum_\r\n(Fig. 185). This instrument, which in the representations of poets and\r\npainters never failed to figure in celestial concerts, produced tones of\r\nincomparable softness. The old romances of chivalry exhausted all the\r\nphrases of admiration in describing the _psalterion_. But the highest\r\neulogium which can be passed on this instrument is that it formed the\r\nstarting-point of the harpsichord, or of the stringed instruments struck\r\nor played on by means of mechanism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185.--Performer on the _Psalterion_. Fourteenth\r\nCentury. (MS. No. 703 in the Bibl. Imp. of Paris.)]\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, thought that a kind of harpsichord with four octaves,\r\nwhich in the fourteenth century was called _dulcimer_ or _dulcemelos_,\r\nand is but imperfectly described, was nothing else than a _psalterion_,\r\nwith a sounding apparatus that assumed the proportions of a large box,\r\nto which also a key-board had been adapted. This instrument, when it had\r\nbut three octaves, was called _clavicord_ or _manicordion_, and in the\r\nsixteenth century produced forty-two to fifty tones or semi-tones: one\r\nstring expressed several notes, and this was effected by means of plates\r\nof metal which, serving as a movable bridge to each string, either\r\nincreased or diminished the intensity of its vibration. The grand-pianos\r\nof the present day unquestionably have their key-boards placed in the\r\nsame position as they were in the _dulcimer_ and _clavicorde_. The\r\nearliest improvements in metallic stringed instruments constructed with\r\na key-board are due to the Italians; these improvements soon had the\r\neffect of throwing the _psalterion_ into oblivion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 186.--_Organistrum._ Ninth Century. (MS. de\r\nSaint-Blaise.)]\r\n\r\nIn the ninth century a stringed instrument was in use the mechanism of\r\nwhich, although not very perfect, evidently tended to an imitation of\r\nthe key-board applied to organs: this was the _organistrum_ (Fig. 186),\r\nan enormous guitar pierced with two sound holes, and provided with three\r\nstrings set in vibration by a small winch; eight movable screws, rising\r\nor falling at will along the finger-board, formed so many keys which\r\nserved to vary the tones. In the first instance two persons performed on\r\nthe _organistrum_--one turning the winch while the other touched the\r\nkeys. When its size was decreased it became the _vielle_ (hurdy-gurdy)\r\nproperly so called, which could be managed by one musician. It was at\r\nfirst called _rubelle_, _rebel_, and _symphonie_; subsequently this last\r\nname was corrupted into _chifonie_ and _sifonie_, and we may remark that\r\neven now in certain districts of central France the _vielle_ still\r\nbears the popular name of _chinforgne_. The _chifonie_ never found a\r\nplace in musical concerts, and fell almost immediately into the hands of\r\nthe mendicants, who solicited alms accompanied by the doleful and\r\nsomewhat discordant notes of this instrument, and thence obtaining the\r\nname of _chifoniens_.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the efforts which were made to substitute wheels and\r\nkey-boards for the action of the fingers on the strings of instruments,\r\nstill those that were played on by the hand only, such as harps and\r\nlutes, did not fail to maintain the preference among skilful musicians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187.--Triangular Saxon Harp of the Ninth Century.\r\n(Bible of Charles le Chauve.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188.--Fifteen-stringed Harp of the Twelfth Century.\r\n(MS. in the Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nThe harp was certainly Saxon in its origin, although some have imagined\r\nthey could discover traces of it in Greek, Roman, and even Egyptian\r\nantiquities. This instrument was at first nothing but a triangular\r\ncithern (Fig. 187), in which the sounding-board occupied the whole of\r\none side from top to bottom, instead of being limited to the lower\r\nangle, as in the primitive _cithara_, or confined to the upper part as\r\nin the psaltery. The English harp (_cithara Anglica_) of the ninth\r\ncentury differed but little from the modern instrument; the simplicity\r\nand good judgment shown in its shape bear witness to the perfection it\r\nhad already attained (Fig. 188). The number of strings and the shape of\r\nthis instrument varied constantly from time to time. The sounding-box\r\nwas sometimes made square, sometimes elongated, and sometimes round. The\r\narms were sometimes straight and sometimes curved; the upper side was\r\noften lengthened so as to represent an animal’s head (Fig. 189) and the\r\nlower angle, on which the instrument rested on the ground, terminated in\r\na griffin’s claw. According to the miniatures in manuscripts, the harp\r\nwas of a size that the top of it did not extend higher than the head of\r\nthe performer, who played upon it in a sitting posture (Fig. 190). There\r\nwere, however, harps of a lighter character, which the musician bore\r\nsuspended from his neck by a strap, and played upon while standing up.\r\nThis portable harp was the one that may _par excellence_ be called\r\nnoble, and was the instrument on which the _trouvères_ accompanied their\r\nvoices when reciting ballads and metrical tales (Fig. 191). In the\r\nromances of chivalry harpers are constantly introduced, and their harps\r\nare ever tuned to some lay of love or war; we find this taking place as\r\nwell in the north as in the south. “The harp,” says Guillaume de\r\nMachaut--\r\n\r\n                  “tous instruments passe,\r\n    Quand sagement bien en joue et compasse.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189.--Harpers of the Twelfth Century, from a\r\nMiniature in a Bible. (MS. in the Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190.--Harp-player of the Fifteenth Century. From an\r\nEnamelled Dish found near Soissons, and preserved in the Bibl. Imp.,\r\nParis.]\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, however, it began to fall into disfavour; it\r\nwas supplanted by the lute (Fig. 192), an instrument much used in the\r\nthirteenth century, and by the guitar, which was brought into fashion in\r\nFrance from Spain and Italy, and formed the delight both of the court\r\nand private circles. At that time every great lord, imitating kings and\r\nprincesses, wished to have his lute or guitar player, and the poet\r\nBonaventure des Périers, _valet de chambre_ of Marguerite de Navarre,\r\ncomposed for her “La Manière de bien et justement entoucher les Lucs et\r\nGuiternes.” The lute and the guitar, which for about two centuries were\r\nin high favour in what was called “chamber music,” have since the\r\nabove-named epoch scarcely been altered in shape. With certain\r\nmodifications, however, they gave rise to the _theorbo_ and the\r\n_mandolin_, which never attained more than a transient or local favour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191.--Minstrel’s Harp, of the Fifteenth Century.\r\n(MS. in the _Miroir Historial_ of Vincent de Beauvais.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192.--Five-stringed Lute. Thirteenth Century. (MS.\r\nin the Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nStringed instruments that were played on by means of bows were not known\r\nbefore the fifth century, and belonged to the northern races; they did\r\nnot become prevalent in Europe generally until after the Norman\r\ninvasion. At first they were but roughly made and rendered indifferent\r\nservice to musical art; but from the twelfth to the sixteenth century,\r\nthese instruments were subject to many changes both in form and name,\r\nand were brought to perfection according as the execution of musicians\r\nalso improved. The most ancient of these instruments is the _crout_\r\n(Fig. 193), which must have produced the _rote_, so dear to the\r\nminstrels and the _trouvères_ of the thirteenth century. The _crout_,\r\nwhich is the instrument placed by tradition in the hands of the\r\nArmorican, Breton, and Scotch bards,[24] was composed of an oblong\r\nsounding-box, more or less hollowed out at the two sides, with a handle\r\nfixed in the body of the instrument, in which were made two openings\r\nthat allowed the performer to hold it by the left hand and at the same\r\ntime to touch the strings; these, as a matter of principle, were only\r\nthree in number. Subsequently it had four strings, and then six--two of\r\nwhich were played open (_à vide_). The musician played on it with a\r\nstraight or convex bow, provided with a single thread either of iron\r\nwire or of twisted hair. Except in England, where the _crout_ was\r\nnational, it did not last beyond the eleventh century. It was replaced\r\nby the _rote_, which was not, as its name (apparently derived from\r\n_rota_, a wheel) would seem to intimate, a _vielle_ or _symphonie_. It\r\nwould be useless to seek for the derivation of the name of _rota_,\r\nexcept in the word _crotta_, the Latin form of the term _crout_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193.--Three-stringed _Crout_ of the Ninth Century.\r\nFrom a Miniature.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194.--King David playing on a _Rote_. From a Painted\r\nWindow of the Thirteenth Century. (Chapel of the Virgin, Cathedral of\r\nTroyes.)]\r\n\r\nIn the earliest _rotes_ (Fig. 194), those made in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, there is an evident intention of combining the two modes of\r\nplaying on the strings--rubbing with a bow and touching with the\r\nfingers. The box, which was not hollowed out and rounded at the two\r\nends, was much deeper at the lower end, where the strings commenced,\r\nthan higher up, near the pegs, where these strings are sounded open\r\nunder the action of the finger, which reaches them through an aperture;\r\nthe bow acting on them near the string-bridge in front of the\r\nsounding-holes. It must have been difficult to touch with the bow one\r\nstring alone, but it should be remarked that the harmonic ideal of this\r\ninstrument consisted in forming accords by consonances of thirds,\r\nfifths, and eighths. The _rote_ was soon developed into a new\r\ninstrument, assuming the form that our violoncellos have almost exactly\r\nretained. The box was increased in size, the handle was lengthened\r\nbeyond the body of the instrument, the number of strings was reduced to\r\nthree or four, stretched over a bridge, and the sounding-holes were made\r\nin the shape of a crescent. From this time the _rote_ acquired a special\r\ncharacter it had not lost even in the sixteenth century, when it became\r\nthe bass-viol. This was its true destination. The size of the instrument\r\ndictated the manner in which it was held, either on the knees or on the\r\nground between the legs (Fig. 195).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195.--German Musicians playing on the Violin and\r\nBass-Viol. Drawn and Engraved by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nThe _vielle_ or _viole_, which had no affinity except in shape with the\r\n_vielle_ (hurdy-gurdy) of the present day, was at first a small _rote_\r\nheld by the performer against his chin or his breast, in much the same\r\nway as the violin is now used (Fig. 196). The box, which was at first\r\nconical and convex, became gradually oval in shape, and the handle\r\nremained short and wide. It was, perhaps, this handle which terminated\r\nin a kind of ornamental scroll in the shape of a violet (_viola_), that\r\noriginated the name of the instrument. The _viole_, just as the _rote_,\r\nformed the accompaniment _obligato_ of certain songs; and among the\r\njugglers who played upon it good performers were rare (Figs. 197, 198).\r\nImprovements in the _vielle_ came for the most part from Italy, where\r\nthe co-operation of a number of skilful lute-players was the means of\r\ngradually forming the violin. Even before the famous Dnifloprugar, born\r\nin the Italian Tyrol, had hit upon the model of his admirable violins,\r\nthe handle of the _vielle_ had been lengthened,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 196.--Oval _Vielle_ with Three Strings, of the\r\nThirteenth Century. (Sculpture on the Cathedral of Amiens.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 197.--Juggler playing on a _Vielle_, hollowed out at\r\nthe Sides. Fifteenth Century. (“Heures du Roi René,” MS. No. 159 in the\r\nBibl. Imp. of the Arsenal, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nits sides hollowed out, and its strings had received a more extended\r\nfield of action by removing the stringer (_cordier_) from the centre of\r\nthe sounding-board\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198.--Player on the _Vielle_. Thirteenth Century.\r\n(Taken from an Enamelled Dish at Soissons.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199.--Angel Playing on a Three-stringed Fiddle.\r\nThirteenth Century. (Sculpture in the Cathedral of Amiens.)]\r\n\r\nHenceforth the play of the board became more free and easy, the\r\nperformer was able to touch every string singly, and was in a position\r\nto substitute effects more characteristic instead of the former\r\nmonotonous consonances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200.--Rebec, of the Sixteenth Century. From\r\nWillemin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201.--Long Monochord played on with a Bow. Fifteenth\r\nCentury. (MS. of Froissart, in the Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nEngland was the birthplace of the _crout_; France invented the _rote_,\r\nand Italy the _viole_; Germany originated the _gigue_,[25] the name of\r\nwhich may perhaps be derived from the similarity presented by the shape\r\nof the instrument to the thigh of a kid. The _gigue_ was provided with\r\nthree strings (Fig. 199), and its special distinction from the _viole_\r\nwas, that instead of the handle being as it were independent of the body\r\nof the instrument, it was a kind of prolongation of the sounding-board.\r\nThe _gigue_, which bore a considerable resemblance to the modern\r\nmandolin, was an instrument on which the Germans were accustomed to work\r\nwonders in the way of performance; according, at least, to the statement\r\nof Adenès, the _trouvère_, who speaks with admiration of the\r\n“_gigueours_ of Germany.” The _gigue_, however, entirely disappeared, at\r\nleast in France, in the fifteenth century; but its name still remained\r\nas the designation of a joyous dance, which for a considerable period\r\nwas enlivened by the sound of this instrument.\r\n\r\nAmong the musical instruments of this class in the Middle Ages, we have\r\nstill to mention the rebec (Fig. 200), which was so often quoted by the\r\nauthors of the day, and yet is so little known, although it figured in\r\nthe court concerts in the time of Rabelais, who specifies it by the term\r\n_aulique_, in contrast to the rustic _cornemuse_ (bagpipes).\r\n\r\nWe must, in conclusion, speak of the monochord (_monocordium_), which is\r\nalways mentioned by the authors of the Middle Ages with feelings of\r\npleasure, although it appears to have been nothing more than the most\r\nsimple and primitive expression of all the other stringed instruments\r\n(Fig. 201). It was composed of a narrow oblong box, on each end of the\r\nfront-board were fixed two immovable bridges supporting a metallic\r\nstring stretched from one to the other, and corresponding to a scale of\r\nnotes traced out on the instrument. A movable bridge, which was shifted\r\nup and down between the string and the scale, produced whatever notes\r\nthe performer wished to bring out. In the eighth century there was a\r\nkind of violin or mandolin furnished with a single metallic string\r\nplayed on with a metallic bow. Later still, we find a kind of harp\r\nformed of a long sounding-box traversed by a single string, over which\r\nthe musician moved a small bow handled with a sudden and rapid movement.\r\n\r\nThe instruments we have named do not, however, embrace all those in use\r\nin the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. There certainly were others\r\nwhich, in spite of the most intelligent investigations, and the most\r\njudicious deductions, are now known to us only by name. As regards, for\r\ninstance, the nature and appearance of the _éles_ or _celes_, the\r\n_échaqueil_ or _échequier_, the _enmorache_, and the _micamon_, we are\r\nleft to the vaguest conjectures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202.--Triangle of the Ninth Century.

For, however\r\ntrifling the matter may appear in itself, this curious point is\r\nconnected with two of the most important inventions of modern\r\ntimes--engraving and printing.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, take upon ourselves to assert too positively that\r\nall the profound researches, persevering study, and ingenious deductions\r\nwhich have been applied to the subject have entirely succeeded in\r\nelucidating the question. Nevertheless, a certain degree of light has\r\nbeen thrown upon it, by which we shall endeavour to profit.\r\n\r\nThe question is, at what date are we to fix the invention of\r\nplaying-cards, and to whom are we to attribute it? In order to solve\r\nthese queries, they must be divided; for, although the introduction of\r\nplaying-cards into Europe may not date back beyond the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and the invention of our game of piquet may not have been prior\r\nto the reign of Charles VII., it is at least asserted--(1st), that\r\nplaying-cards existed in India in the twelfth century; (2nd), that the\r\nancients played at games in which certain figures and numbers were\r\nrepresented on dice or tablets; (3rd), that in comparatively recent\r\ntimes the game of chess and the game of cards presented striking\r\naffinities, proving the common origin of these two games--one connected\r\nwith painting, the other with sculpture.\r\n\r\nIf we are to believe Herodotus, the Lydians, in order to beguile the\r\nsufferings of hunger during a long and cruel famine, invented nearly\r\nevery game, especially that of dice. Later authors ascribe the honour of\r\nthese inventions to the Greeks, when irritated at the tedious delays of\r\nthe siege of Troy. Cicero even mentions by name Pyrrhus and Palamedes as\r\nthe originators of the “games in use in camps” (_ludos castrenses_).\r\nWhat were these games? Some say, chess; others, dice or knuckle-bones.\r\n\r\nCertain very ancient specimens prove unquestionably that the Indian\r\ncards were nothing but a transformation of the game of chess; for the\r\nprincipal pieces in this game are reproduced on the cards, but in such a\r\nway that eight players instead of two could take part in it. In the game\r\nof chess there were only two armies of pawns, each having at its head a\r\nking, a vizier (who was afterwards turned into a “queen”), a knight, an\r\nelephant (which became a “bishop”), and a dromedary (afterwards a\r\n“castle”). There can be no doubt that the course and arrangement of\r\nthese games were very different; but in both may be found an original\r\naffinity in the fact that they recalled to mind the terrible game of\r\nwar, in which each adversary had to attack by means of stratagems,\r\ncombinations, and vigilance.\r\n\r\nWe have now learned from certain authority (Abel de Rémusat, _Journal\r\nAsiatique_, September, 1822) that playing-cards, proceeding from India\r\nand China, were, like the game of chess (Fig. 203), in the hands of the\r\nArabians and the Saracens at the commencement of the twelfth century. It\r\nis therefore almost certain they must have been brought into Europe\r\nafter the Crusades, with the arts, traditions, and customs which the men\r\nof the West then derived from their Oriental antagonists. There is,\r\nhowever, every reason to believe that the use of cards spread but\r\nslowly; for at an epoch when the civil and ecclesiastical authorities\r\nwere constantly issuing ordinances against games of chance, we do not\r\nfind that cards were ever the subject of legal proceedings, like dice\r\nand chess.\r\n\r\nThe first formal mention made of playing-cards is found in a manuscript\r\nchronicle of Nicolas de Covelluzzo, preserved in the archives of\r\nViterbo. “In the year 1379,” says the chronicler, “there was introduced\r\nat Viterbo the game of cards, which comes from the country of the\r\nSaracens, and is called by the latter _naïb_.” There is, in fact, a\r\nGerman book, the “Jeu d’Or,” printed at Augsbourg in 1472, which\r\ntestifies to the fact that cards existed in Germany in the year 1300.\r\nBut, in the first place, this evidence is not contemporary with the fact\r\nalleged; and, besides,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 203.--Chess-Players. Fac-simile of a Miniature of\r\nthe Thirteenth Century. (MS. 7,266, Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nwe may well suppose that the vanity of the Germans, which had attributed\r\nto themselves the discovery of printing, desired, with about as much\r\nreason, to appropriate also the invention of cards--that is, of\r\nwood-engraving. We shall, therefore, act judiciously in paying but\r\nlittle attention to this doubtful assertion, and hold to the account\r\ngiven by the chronicler of Viterbo. But the latter, unfortunately,\r\nfurnishes us with no details as to the nature of these cards. Was the\r\ngame similar to that which is still extant in India? Or was it one\r\npeculiar to the Arabs? These are questions which must remain unsolved.\r\nThe only facts presented to our notice are, that in 1379 cards made\r\ntheir appearance in Europe, brought from Arabia, or the country of the\r\nSaracens, and that their original name is given. The Italians for a long\r\ntime gave to cards the name of _naïbi_. In Spain they are still called\r\n_naypes_. If it be understood that the word _naïb_ in Arabic signifies\r\n“captain,” we shall see that the game in question was one of a military\r\ncharacter, like that of chess, and we shall be led to recognise in these\r\nprimitive cards the _tarots_ which were for a long time current in the\r\nsouth of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 1387, John I., King of Castile, issued an ordinance prohibiting to\r\nplay with dice, _naypes_, or at chess.\r\n\r\nIn the archives of the Audit Office, in Paris, there formerly existed an\r\naccount of the treasurer, Poupart, who states that, in 1392, he had\r\n“paid to Jacquemin Gringonneur, painter, for three packs of cards in\r\ngold and various colours, ornamented with numerous devices, to lay\r\nbefore the lord the king (Charles VI.) for his amusement, 50 sols of\r\nParis.” This game, which seemed at first intended only for the amusement\r\nof the king in his mental derangement, subsequently spread so much among\r\nthe people, that the provost of Paris, in an ordinance of January 22,\r\n1397, issued a prohibition “to persons engaged in trade from playing at\r\ntennis, bowls, dice, _cards_, and skittles, except on feast-days.” We\r\nmust remark that, twenty-eight years previously, Charles V., in a\r\ncelebrated ordinance which enumerates all the games of chance, did not\r\nmention cards.\r\n\r\nThe “Red Book” of the town of Ulm, a manuscript register preserved in\r\nthe archives of that town, contains an ordinance dated in 1397, in which\r\nis conveyed a prohibition of games with cards.\r\n\r\nThese facts are the only authenticated evidence which can be brought\r\nforward with a view of fixing the approximate period of the introduction\r\nof cards into Europe. Some authors have certainly imagined they were in\r\na position to determine an earlier epoch, but they have gone upon data\r\nthe value of which has since been destroyed by more thorough\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century there are evident traces both of the existence\r\nand popularity of cards in Italy, Spain, Germany, and France. Their\r\nnames, colours, and emblems, their number and forms, were indeed\r\nconstantly changing, according to the country in which they were used\r\nand the fancy of the players. But whether called _tarots_ or “French\r\ncards,” they were in fact nothing but modifications of the primitive\r\nOriental cards, and an imitation more or less faithful of the ancient\r\ngame of chess.\r\n\r\nReckoning from the fifteenth century, we meet with cards in every\r\nenumeration of games of chance; we find them also proscribed and\r\ncondemned in ecclesiastical and royal ordinances. The clergy, too,\r\nraised their voices against them; but these measures did not prevent the\r\ntrade in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 204 and 205.--Jean Dunois, King Alexander, Julius\r\nCæsar, King Arthur, Charles the Great, and Godefroi de Bouillon. From\r\nancient coloured Wood-Engravings; prints analogous to the first\r\nPlaying-Cards of the Fifteenth Century. (Bibl. Imp., Paris, Department\r\nof Manuscripts.)]\r\n\r\nthem from increasing, nor great attention to their improved manufacture.\r\nPoets and romance-writers vied with each other in speaking of them; they\r\nappeared in the miniatures in manuscripts, and also in the first\r\nattempts at engraving on wood and copper (Figs. 204 and 205). And,\r\nnotwithstanding the fragile nature of the cards themselves, some have\r\nbeen preserved which belong to the earliest years of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, cards had, in principle, been classed among the\r\nnumber of childish games; but it may be safely asserted that this could\r\nnot have long been the case, else how could we explain the legal\r\nstrictures and the ecclesiastical anathemas of which they were the\r\nsubject?\r\n\r\nSt. Bernard, for example, speaking on the 5th of March, 1423, to the\r\ncrowd assembled in front of a church at Siena, inveighed with so much\r\nenergy, and fulminated with so much persuasion, against games of chance,\r\nthat all who heard ran at once and fetched their dice, chess, and\r\n_cards_, and burnt them on the very spot. But, adds the chronicle, there\r\nwas a card-maker who, being ruined by the sermon of the saint, went to\r\nseek him, and with a flood of tears said to him: “Father, I am a maker\r\nof cards, and I have no other trade by which to live. By preventing me\r\nfrom following my trade, you condemn me to die of hunger.” “If painting\r\nis all you are capable of,” replied the preacher, “paint this picture.”\r\nAnd he showed him an image of a radiating sun, in the centre of which\r\nshone the monogram of Christ--I. H. S. The artisan followed his advice,\r\nand soon made his fortune by painting this representation, which was\r\nadopted by St. Bernard as his device.\r\n\r\nAlthough in every direction similar censures were directed against\r\ncards, they nevertheless did not fail to come much into fashion,\r\nespecially in Italy; and to have a considerable sale. Thus, in 1441, we\r\nfind the master card-makers at Venice “who formed a rather numerous\r\nassociation,” claiming and obtaining from the senate a kind of\r\nprohibitory order against “the large quantity of _painted_ and _printed_\r\ncards which were made out of Venice and were introduced into the town,\r\nto the great detriment of their art.” It is important to notice that\r\nmention is made here of _printed_ as well as of painted cards. The fact\r\nis, that at this date, not only did all the cities in Italy make their\r\nown cards, but, in consequence of the invention of wood-engraving,\r\nGermany and Holland exported a large quantity of them. We must also\r\npoint out that documents of the same date appear to establish a\r\ndistinction between the primitive _naïbi_ and cards properly so called,\r\nwithout, however, affording any detailed characteristics of either. It\r\nis, however, known that prior to the year 1419, one François Fibbia, a\r\nnoble of Pisa who died in exile at Bologna, obtained from the\r\n“reformers” of this city, on the score of his being the inventor of the\r\ngame of _tarrochino_, the right of placing his escutcheon of arms on the\r\n“queen _de bâton_,” and that of his wife’s arms on the “queen _de\r\ndenier_.” _Bâtons_, _deniers_, with _coupes_ and _épées_, were then the\r\nsuits of the Italian cards, as _carreau_ (diamond), _trèfle_ (club),\r\n_cœur_ (heart), and _pique_ (spade), were those of the French cards.\r\n\r\nNo original specimen has been preserved of the _tarots_ (_tarrochi_,\r\n_tarrochini_) or Italian cards of this epoch; but we possess a pack\r\nengraved about 1460, which is known to be an exact copy of them. Added\r\nto this, Raphael Maffei, who lived at the end of the fifteenth century,\r\nhas left in his “Commentaries” a description of _tarots_, which were, he\r\nsays, “a new invention,”--in comparison, doubtless, with the origin of\r\nplaying-cards. From these two documents--though they present some\r\ndifferences--we may gather that the pack of _tarots_ was then composed\r\nof four or five series or suits, each of ten cards, bearing consecutive\r\nnumbers, and presenting so many _deniers_, _bâtons_, _coupes_, and\r\n_épées_, equal in number to that of the card. To these series we must\r\nadd a whole assortment of figures, representing the _King_, the _Queen_,\r\nthe _Knight_, the _Foot-traveller_, the _World_, _Justice_, an _Angel_,\r\nthe _Sun_, the _Devil_, a _Castle_, _Death_, a _Gibbet_, the _Pope_,\r\n_Love_, a _Buffoon_ (Fig. 206), &c.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that _tarots_ were current in France long before the\r\ninvention of the game of piquet, which is unquestionably of French\r\norigin; and among these _tarots_ we must class the cards that are called\r\nthose of Charles VI. (Figs. 207 and 208), and are now preserved in the\r\nPrint-Room of the Bibliothèque Impériale in Paris; these may be\r\nconsidered as the oldest to be found in any collection, either public or\r\nprivate. The Abbé de Longuerue states that he saw the pack with all its\r\ncards complete; but only seventeen have been preserved to our day. These\r\ncards are painted with delicacy, like the miniatures in manuscripts, on\r\na gilt ground, filled with dots forming a perforated ornamentation; they\r\nare also surrounded by a silvered border in which a similar dotting\r\ndepicts a spirally twisted ribbon. This dotting is doubtless the _tare_,\r\na kind of goffering produced by small holes pricked out and arranged in\r\ncompartments, to which the _tarots_ owe their names, and of which our\r\npresent cards still retain a kind of reminiscence, in their backs being\r\ncovered with arabesques or dotted over in black or various colours.\r\nThese cards were about seven inches long and three and a half inches\r\nwide, and were painted in distemper on cardboard ·039 inch thick. The\r\ncomposition of them is ingenious and to some extent skilful, the drawing\r\ncorrect and full of character, and the colouring or illumination\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 206.--The Buffoon, a Card from a Pack of _Tarots_.\r\nFifteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nAmong the subjects they represent are some which deserve all the more\r\nattention, because they can hardly fail to recall to mind a conception\r\nsomewhat similar to that of the “Dance of Death,” that terrible\r\n“morality” which, dating from this epoch, was destined to increase more\r\nand more in popularity. Thus, for instance, by the side of the\r\n_Emperor_, who is covered with silver armour and holds the globe and the\r\nsceptre, a _Hermit_ makes his appearance as an old man muffled in a cowl\r\nand holding up an hour-glass, an emblem of the rapidity of time. Then we\r\nhave the _Pope_, who, with the tiara on his head, sits between two\r\ncardinals; but _Death_ is also there, mounted on a grey horse with a\r\nrough and shaggy coat, and sweeping down with his scythe kings, popes,\r\nbishops, and other great men of the earth. If we see _Love_, represented\r\nby three couples of lovers who embrace as they converse, while two\r\ncupids dart at them their arrows from a cloud above; we also see a\r\n_Gibbet_, on which hangs a gambler suspended by one foot, and still\r\nholding in his hand a bag of money. An _Esquire_, clothed in gold and\r\nscarlet, rides gallantly along, proudly waving his sword; a _Chariot_\r\nbears in triumph an officer in full armour; a _Fool_ places his cap and\r\nbells under his arm that he may count upon his fingers. Finally, the\r\nlast trumpets are waking up the dead, who come out of their graves to\r\nappear at the Last Judgment.\r\n\r\n[Illustrations: Fig. 207.--The Moon.\r\n\r\nFig. 208.--Justice.\r\n\r\n(Cards taken from the Pack, said to be of Charles VI., preserved in the\r\nBibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nMost of these allegorical subjects have been retained in the _tarots_,\r\nwhich include, independent of the sixteen figures of our piquet-pack,\r\ntwenty-two cards, representing the _Emperor_, the _Lover_, the\r\n_Chariot_, the _Hermit_, the _Gibbet_, _Death_, the _House of God_, the\r\n_End of the World_, &c.\r\n\r\nWe should scarcely be justified in imagining that these _tarots_,\r\npresenting as they did a picture of life so gloomily philosophical,\r\nregarded from a Christian point of view, could have enjoyed any great\r\nfavour in the centre of a frivolous and corrupt court, devoted to little\r\nelse but _fêtes_, masquerades, and singing; this, too, at a time when\r\nthe State, a prey to every kind of intrigue, was falling into ruin, and\r\nthe voice of insurrection was surging up among a people burdened by\r\ntaxes, and decimated by pestilence and famine. On the other hand these\r\n_tarots_ might well please the imagination of certain good people who,\r\nhaving been deprived of their property in some of the disturbances\r\nincidental to these times, could not fail to accept as a consolation\r\nsuch emblematical representations of life and death. Artists of every\r\nkind tried their best to reproduce them in all forms; and as these\r\ndesigns found a place even in the ornaments of the female sex, it was\r\nscarcely probable that playing-cards would form an exception.\r\n\r\nWe are in possession of the remains of two ancient packs of cards,\r\nproduced by means of engraved plates; they were discovered, like most\r\ncards of this date which have come to light, in the bindings of books of\r\nthe fifteenth century. These cards, which belong to the reign of Charles\r\nVII., are essentially French in their character. We find in them the\r\nking, the queen, and the knave of each suit, as in our present pack of\r\npiquet cards. In one of these ancient packs we notice, however, traces\r\nof the Saracenic origin of the _naïbi_; the Mussulman “crescent” being\r\nsubstituted for the “diamond,” while the “club” is depicted in the\r\nArabian or Moorish fashion; that is, with four similar branches. There\r\nis also another peculiarity; the “king of hearts” is represented by a\r\nkind of savage, or hairy ape, leaning upon a knotty stick. The “queen”\r\nof the same suit is likewise covered with hair, and holds a torch in her\r\nhand. The “knave of clubs,” who is well fitted to serve as an escort to\r\nthe “king” and “queen of hearts,” is also covered with hair, and carries\r\na knotty stick on his shoulder. We may, besides, notice the legs of a\r\nfourth hairy personage among those which have been separated from their\r\nbodies by the knife of the bookbinder. But, with the exception of these,\r\nall the other personages are clothed according to the fashion or the\r\netiquette which prevailed at the court of Charles VII. The “queen of\r\ncrescents” is represented in a costume similar to that of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 209.--Charles VI. on his Throne, from a Miniature in\r\nthe MS. of the Kings of France. (Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nMary of Anjou, the wife of the king; or in that of Gérarde Grassinel,\r\nhis mistress. The representations of the kings, the hairy one excepted,\r\nare identical with those we have of Charles VII. himself, or the nobles\r\nof his suite. Their costume was a velvet hat surmounted by the crown\r\nornamented with fleurs-de-lis; a robe open in front and lined with\r\nermine or _menu vair_, a tight doublet, and close stockings. The\r\n“knaves” are copied from the pages and sergeants-at-arms of the period;\r\none wears the plumed flat cap and long cloak; another, on the contrary,\r\nis clad in a short dress, and stands erect in his close-fitting doublet\r\nand tightly drawn breeches. The latter displays, written on a streamer\r\nwhich he is unrolling, the name of the card-maker, “F. Clerc.” These are\r\ncertainly cards of French invention, or, at any rate, of French\r\nmanufacture; but what explanation are we to give of the presence of the\r\nsavage “king” and “queen,” and the “hairy knave,” among the kings,\r\nqueens, and knaves all dressed according to the fashion of the time of\r\nCharles VII.? We may, perhaps, find a satisfactory reply by referring to\r\nthe chronicles of the preceding reign.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of January, 1392, there was a grand _fête_ at the mansion of\r\nQueen Blanche in honour of the marriage of a Chevalier de Vermandois\r\nwith one of the queen’s ladies. The king, Charles VI., had only just\r\nrecovered from his mental malady. One of his favourites, Hugonin de\r\nJanzay, projected an entertainment in which the king and five lords were\r\nto take a part. “It was,” says Juvénal des Ursins, “a masquerade of wild\r\nmen chained together, and all shaggy; their dress was made to fit close\r\nto their body, and was rendered rough by flax and tow fastened on by\r\nresinous pitch, greased so as to shine the better.” Froissart, who was\r\nan eye-witness of this _fête_, says that the six actors in the _ballet_\r\nentered the hall yelling and shaking their chains. As it was not known\r\nwho these maskers were, the Duke of Orleans, brother of the king,\r\nwishing to find out, took a lighted torch from the hands of his servant,\r\nand held it so close to one of these strange personages that “the heat\r\nof the fire caught the flax.” The king was fortunately separated from\r\nhis companions, who were all burned, with the exception of one only, who\r\nthrew himself into a tub full of water. Although Charles VI. escaped\r\nfrom this peril, he was deeply affected by the thought of the danger to\r\nwhich he had been exposed, and the result was a relapse into his former\r\ninsanity.\r\n\r\nThis fearful _ballet des ardents_ left such an impression on the minds\r\nof people generally, that seventy years afterwards a German engraver\r\nmade it the subject of a print. Should we, then, be venturing on an\r\ninadmissible hypothesis if we attribute to a cardmaker of this epoch the\r\nidea of introducing the same subject in a pack of cards? which, as is\r\nabundantly proved, was modified according to the whim of the artist. In\r\norder to justify the costume of a female savage and the torch, which\r\nare given to the “queen of hearts,” we must not forget that Isabel of\r\nBavaria, consort of Charles VI., is accused of having assisted in\r\ndevising this fatal masquerade, which was intended to get rid of the\r\nking; and of having taken as her accomplice the Duke of Orleans, her\r\nbrother-in-law, who is said to have purposely set fire to the clothing\r\nof these pretended wild men, among whom was the king.\r\n\r\nThe second pack, or fragment of a pack, which is dated back to this\r\nepoch, presents a similarity to our present cards of a yet more striking\r\nnature, at least in the characters and costumes of the figures; although\r\nthe names and devices of the personages still are suggestive of their\r\nSaracenic origin. We must remark, under this head, that for several\r\ncenturies the names coupled with the different personages were\r\nincessantly varying. In this pack we find “kings,” “queens,” and\r\n“knaves” of clubs, hearts, spades, and diamonds; the Saracenic crescent\r\nhas disappeared. The “kings” are all holding sceptres, and the “queens”\r\ncarry flowers. Everything in the representations is not only in harmony\r\nwith the fashions of the period, but in addition to this, there are no\r\nviolations either of the laws of heraldry or of the usages of chivalry.\r\n\r\nAccording to tradition, this pack, the true piquet-pack, which\r\nsuperseded the Italian _tarots_ and the cards of Charles VI., and soon\r\nbecame generally used in France, was the invention of Etienne Vignoles,\r\ncalled La Hire, one of the bravest and most active soldiers of that\r\nperiod. The tradition has a right to our respect, for the mere\r\nexamination of this piquet-pack proves that it must have been the work\r\nof some accomplished _chevalier_, or at least of a mind profoundly\r\nimbued with the manners and customs of chivalry. But, without any wish\r\nto exclude La Hire, who, as the historians say, “always had his helmet\r\non his head and his lance in his hand, ready to attack the English, and\r\nnever rested until he died of his wounds,” we are led rather to ascribe\r\nthe honour of this ingenious invention to one of his contemporaries,\r\nEtienne Chevalier, secretary and treasurer to the king, who was\r\ndistinguished by his skill in designing. Jacques Cœur, whose commercial\r\nrelations with the East brought upon him the accusation of having “sent\r\narms to the Saracens,” might well have become the importer of Asiatic\r\ncards into France, and Chevalier might then have amused himself by\r\napplying devices to them or, as was then said, by _moralising_ or\r\nsymbolising them. In India it had been the game of the vizier and of\r\nwar; the royal treasurer turned it into a pack having reference to the\r\nknight and chivalry. In the first place he placed on it his own armorial\r\nbearings, the unicorn, which figures in several ancient packs of cards.\r\nHe did not forget the allusive arms of Jacques Cœur, and substituted\r\n“hearts” for the _coupes_. He made the “clubs” imitate the heraldic\r\nflower of Agnes Sorel; and also changed the _deniers_ into diamonds, or\r\narrow-heads (Fig. 210), and the _épées_ into spades, to do honour to the\r\ntwo brothers Jean and Gaspard Bureau, grand-masters of artillery in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 210.--Ancient French Card of the Fifteenth Century.\r\n(Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 211.--Specimen of a Pack of Cards of the Sixteenth\r\nCentury. (Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nEtienne Chevalier, as the most skilful designer of emblems of the\r\nperiod, was eminently capable of substituting, in playing-cards, ladies\r\nor queens for the Oriental “viziers” or Italian “knights” which, on the\r\n_tarots_, figured alone among the “kings” and “knaves.” We must,\r\nhowever, repeat that we have no intention of depriving La Hire of the\r\nhonour of the invention, and only hazard a supposition in addition to\r\nthe opinion generally received.\r\n\r\nThese cards, which bear all the characteristics of the reign of Charles\r\nVII., must be looked upon as the first attempts at wood-engraving, and\r\nat printing by means of engraved blocks. They were probably executed\r\nbetween 1420 and 1440, that is to say, prior to most of the known\r\nxylographic productions. Playing-cards, therefore, served as a kind of\r\nintroduction or prelude to printing from engraved blocks, an invention\r\nwhich considerably preceded the printing from movable characters.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we observe that so early as the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury playing-cards were spread all over Europe, it is but natural to\r\nimagine that some economical plan of manufacture had been discovered and\r\nemployed. Thus, as we have already mentioned, Jacquemin Gringonneur, in\r\n1392, was paid fifty-six sols of Paris, that is about £7 1_s._ 8_d._ of\r\nour present money, for three packs of _tarots_, painted for the King of\r\nFrance. One single pack of _tarots_, admirably painted, about the year\r\n1415, by Marziano, secretary to the Duke of Milan, cost one thousand\r\nfive hundred golden crowns (about £625); but in 1454, a pack of cards\r\nintended for the Dauphin of France cost no more than five _sous of\r\nTours_ (about eleven or twelve shillings). In the interval between 1392\r\nand 1454 means had been discovered of making playing-cards at a cheap\r\nrate, and of converting them into an object of trade; mercers were\r\naccustomed to sell them together with the “pins,” which then took the\r\nplace of copper and silver counters; hence the French proverb, “Tirer\r\nson épingle du jeu” (to get out of a scrape).\r\n\r\nAlthough the use of playing-cards continued to extend more and more, we\r\nmust not imagine that they had ceased to be the subject of prohibitory\r\nand condemnatory ordinances on the part of the civil and ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities. On the contrary, a long list might be made of the decrees\r\nlaunched against cards themselves and those that used them. Princes and\r\nlords, as a matter of right, felt themselves above these prohibitions;\r\nthe lower orders and the dissolute did not fail to infringe them. It was\r\nnevertheless the case, that in the face of these constantly-renewed\r\nprohibitions, the manufacture of playing-cards could only be developed,\r\nor rather perhaps be carried on, in some indirect mode. Thus, we find\r\nthe business at first was concealed, as it were, under that of a\r\nstationer or illuminator. Not until December, 1581--that is, in the\r\nreign of Henry III.--do we find the first regulation fixing the\r\nstatutes of the “master-cardmakers.” These statutes, confirmed by\r\nletters patent in 1584 and 1613, remained in force down to the (French)\r\nRevolution. In the confirmation of corporate privileges granted at the\r\nlatter date, it is laid down as a rule that henceforth master-cardmakers\r\nshould be bound to place their names, surnames, signs, and devices on\r\nthe “knave of clubs” (Figs. 212, 213) of every pack of cards. This\r\nprescription appears to have done nothing more than legalise an old\r\ncustom--a fact which may be proved by an examination of the curious\r\ncollection of ancient cards in the Print-Room of the Bibliothèque\r\nImpériale. We have already stated that for a period of many years the\r\nnames given to the various personages in the pack varied constantly,\r\naccording to the fancy of the cardmaker; a mere glance at the collection\r\njust mentioned will confirm this assertion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 212 and 213.--The “Knave of Clubs” in the Packs of\r\nCards of R. Passerel and R. Le Cornu. (Sixteenth Century. Bibl. Imp.,\r\nParis.)]\r\n\r\nThe cards that might be styled those of Charles VII., which appear to us\r\nto convey some reminiscence of the _ballet des ardents_, have no\r\ninscription but the name of the cardmaker. But in the other pack of the\r\nsame date the “knave of clubs” bears as a legend the word _Rolan_; the\r\n“king of clubs,” _Sans Souci_; the “queen of clubs,” _Tromperie_; the\r\n“king of diamonds,” _Corsube_; the “queen of diamonds,” _En toi te fie_;\r\nthe “king of spades,” _Apollin_, &c. This collection of names reveals to\r\nus the threefold influence of the Saracenic origin of playing-cards, the\r\nideas conveyed at that period to the mind by the reading of the old\r\nromances of chivalry, and the effect of contemporary events. In fact, in\r\nthe ancient epics, _Apollin_ (or Apollo) is a deity by whom the Saracens\r\nwere accustomed to swear; _Corsube_ is a knight of Cordova (_Corsuba_).\r\n_Sans Souci_ is evidently one of those _sobriquets_ which squires\r\nacquired the habit of adopting at the time they were proving themselves\r\nworthy of the title of knight. Roland, the mighty Paladin who died at\r\nRoncevaux fighting against the Saracens, seems to have been placed upon\r\nthe cards in order to oppose the memory of his glory to that of the\r\ninfidel kings. The queen “_En toi te fie_” might well allude to Joan of\r\nArc. The queen “_Tromperie_” recalls to mind Isabel of Bavaria, who was\r\nan unfaithful wife and a cruel mother; and, moreover, had betrayed\r\nFrance to England. All these ideas are doubtless mere suppositions, but\r\nsuch as a critical examination of a more minute and extended character\r\nwould perhaps succeed in changing into unquestionable certainties.\r\n\r\nNext after the cards of the time of Charles VII. follow, as the most\r\nancient in point of date, two packs which certainly belong to the reign\r\nof Louis XII. One of these packs does not bear any kind of legend; in\r\nthe other the “king of hearts” is called _Charles_; the “king of\r\ndiamonds,” _Cæsar_; the “king of clubs,” _Arthur_; the “king of spades,”\r\n_David_; the “queen of hearts,” _Héleine_; the “queen of diamonds,”\r\n_Judith_; the “queen of clubs,” _Rachel_; the “queen of spades,”\r\n_Persabée_ (doubtless for Bathsheba).\r\n\r\nIn a pack of cards belonging to the reign of Francis I., the “king of\r\nclubs” becomes _Alexander_, and the name of _Judith_ is transferred to\r\nthe “queen of hearts;” and for the first time (at least in the specimens\r\nwhich have been preserved) some of the “knaves” bear special names--the\r\n“knave of hearts” is _La Hire_, and the “knave of diamonds” _Hector of\r\nTrois_ (_sic_).\r\n\r\nA few years later, about the time of the battle of Pavia and of the\r\nking’s captivity, the influence of Spanish and Italian fashions begins\r\nto affect the legends on packs of cards. It is remarked that the “knave\r\nof spades,” which presents nothing in the way of a legend but the name\r\nof the cardmaker, is made to resemble Charles-Quint (Fig. 211). The\r\nthree other knaves bear the singular denominations of _Prien Roman_,\r\n_Capita Fili_, and _Capitane Vallant_. The kings are: “hearts,” _Julius\r\nCæsar_; “diamonds,” _Charles_; “clubs,” _Hector_; “spades,” _David_. The\r\nqueens are: “hearts,” _Héleine_; “diamonds,” _Lucresse_; “clubs,”\r\n_Pentaxlée_ (Penthesilea); “spades,” _Beciabée_ (Bathsheba).\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry II., the names given to the personages come much\r\nnearer to the arrangement observed in our present cards. _Cæsar_ is the\r\n“king of diamonds;” _David_, the “king of spades;” _Alexander_, the\r\n“king of clubs.” _Rachel_ is the “queen of diamonds;” _Argine_, of\r\n“clubs;” _Pallas_, of “spades.” _Hogier_, _Hector of Troy_, and _La\r\nHire_, are the “knaves” of “spades,” “diamonds,” and “hearts,”\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Henry III., who devoted himself much more to regulating\r\nthe fashions than to governing his kingdom, and was the first to grant\r\nstatutes to the association of cardmakers, the pack of cards became the\r\nmirror of the extravagant fashions of this effeminate reign. The “kings”\r\nhave the pointed beard, the starched collar, the plumed hat, the\r\nbreeches puffing out round the loins, the slashed doublet, and the\r\ntight-fitting hose. The “queens” have their hair drawn back and crisped,\r\nthe dress close round the body, and made _à vertugarde_ (in the form of\r\na hoop-petticoat). We see a _Dido_, an _Elizabeth_, and a _Clotilde_,\r\nmake their appearance in the respective characters of “queens” of\r\n“diamonds,” “hearts,” and “spades.” Among the kings figure\r\n_Constantine_, _Clovis_, _Augustus_, and _Solomon_.\r\n\r\nThe valiant Béarnais[26] mounts the throne, and the cards still reflect\r\nthe aspect of his court. But soon _Astrea_ and a whole _cortége_ of\r\ntender and gallant heroes begin to assume an influence over refined\r\nminds, and we then find _Cyrus_ and _Semiramis_ as “king and queen” of\r\ndiamonds; _Roxana_ is the “queen of hearts” (Fig. 214), _Ninus_ the\r\n“king of spades,” &c.\r\n\r\nIn the regency of Marie de Medicis, in the reign of Louis XIII., or\r\nrather of Richelieu, in the time of Anne of Austria and Louis XIV.,\r\nplaying-cards continued to assume the character of the period, following\r\nthe whim of the court, or the fancy of the cardmaker. At a certain time\r\nthey began to take an Italian character. The “king of diamonds” was\r\ncalled _Carel_; his queen, _Lucresi_; the “queen of spades,” _Barbera_;\r\nthe “queen of clubs,” _Penthamée_; the “knave of diamonds,” _capit.\r\nMelu_.\r\n\r\nA vast field of investigation would lie before us if, in tracing out the\r\ndetailed history of these numerous variations, we were to endeavour to\r\ndistinguish and settle the different causes which gave rise to them. One\r\nfact must certainly strike any one devoting himself to such inquiry; he\r\nwould see that, in contradistinction to the changes which have affected\r\nthe personages on the cards and their names, a continuous state of\r\nstability has been the characteristic of the four suits in the French\r\ncards or the piquet-pack, which were adopted from the very commencement,\r\nand that no attempt has ever been made against their arrangement and\r\nnature. _Cœur_ (hearts), _carreau_ (diamonds), _trèfle_ (clubs), and\r\n_pique_ (spades)--these were the divisions established by La Hire or\r\nChevalier, and they are still faithfully maintained in the present day,\r\nalthough at various times endeavours have been made to define their\r\nsymbolical signification.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the opinion of Father Menestrier was the prevalent one;\r\nthat “hearts” were an emblem of the clergy or the choir (_chœur_);\r\n“diamonds,” of the citizens, who had their rooms paved with square\r\ntiles; “clubs,” of labourers; and “spades,” of military men. But\r\nMenestrier was in egregious error. A much clearer view of the matter was\r\ntaken by Father Daniel, who, like all sensible interpreters, recognising\r\nin cards a game of an essentially military character, asserted that\r\n“hearts” denoted the courage of the commanders and soldiers; “clubs”\r\n(_trèfle_--“trefoil”) the stores of forage; “spades” and “diamonds,” the\r\nmagazines of arms. This was a view which, as we think, comes much closer\r\nto the real interpretation of the suits; and Bullet was still nearer the\r\nmark when he recognised _offensive_ arms in “clubs” and “spades,” and\r\n_defensive_ arms in “hearts” and “diamonds.” The first were the sword\r\nand the lance; the second, the target and the shield.\r\n\r\nBut in order to do full honour to French cards, we must not exclude from\r\nour attention the _tarots_, which preceded our game of piquet, and\r\ncontinued to be simultaneously used even in France.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish and Italian cardmakers, who had been nearly always\r\nestablished in France, made a large quantity of _tarots_ (Fig. 215); but\r\nthey made a certain concession to French politeness by substituting\r\n“queens” for the “cavaliers” of their national game. We must remark\r\nhere, that even at the epoch of the conquests of Charles VIII. and Louis\r\nXII., French cards with the four “queens” replacing the “cavaliers”\r\nnever succeeded in nationalising themselves in Italy, and still less in\r\nSpain; on the contrary, the fact was that as regards this point of\r\nfashion, the vanquished people obtained the advantage over their\r\nconquerors, and the _tarots_ came into full favour among the victorious\r\nsoldiery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 214.--Roxana, Queen of Hearts. (Specimen of the\r\nCards of the time of Henry IV.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 215.--Card of Italian _Tarots_, from the Pack of the\r\n_minchiate_. (Collection of Playing-Cards, Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards must certainly have received the Oriental _naïb_ from the\r\nMoors and Saracens a long time prior to the introduction of this game\r\ninto Europe at Viterbo; but we have no written proofs which certify to\r\nthe existence of cards among the Saracens of Spain. The first document\r\nin which they are mentioned is the edict of John I., of the date of\r\n1387, to which reference has been made. Certain _savants_ have\r\nendeavoured to ascertain the signification of the four suits of the\r\nSpanish _naypes_, and have fancied that they could distinguish in them a\r\nspecial symbolism. In their view, the _dineros_, _copas_, _bastos_, and\r\n_spadas_, denoted the four estates which composed the population: the\r\nmerchants, who have the money; the priests, who hold the chalice or cup;\r\nthe peasantry, who handle the staff; and the nobles, who wear the\r\nsword. This explanation, although ingenious, does not appear to us to be\r\nbased on any very solid foundation. The signs or suits of the numeral\r\ncards were fixed upon in the East, and Spain as well as Italy merely\r\nadopted them without taking much trouble to penetrate into their\r\nallegorical meaning. The Spaniards became so addicted to this game that\r\nthey soon preferred it to any other recreation; and we know that when\r\nthe companions of Christopher Columbus, who had just discovered America,\r\nformed their first settlement at St. Domingo, they almost instantly set\r\nto work to make playing-cards out of the leaves of trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 216 and 217.--The “Three” and “Eight” of “Bells.”\r\nGerman Cards of the Sixteenth Century. (Bibl. Imp. of Paris.\r\nPrint-Room.)]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that playing-cards very soon made their way from\r\nItaly into Germany; but as they advanced towards the North they almost\r\nimmediately lost their Oriental characteristics and Saracenic name.\r\nThere is, in fact, no longer any etymological trace to be found in the\r\nold German language of the words _naïb_, _naïbi_, or _naypes_. Cards\r\nwere called\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 218 and 219.--The “Two of Bells” and the “King of\r\nAcorns,” taken from a Pack of Cards of the Sixteenth Century, designed\r\nand engraved by a German Master. (Bibl. Imp. of Paris. Print-Room.)]\r\n\r\n_Briefe_, that is, letters; the game itself _Spielbriefe_, game of\r\nletters; the earliest cardmakers were _Briefmaler_, painters of letters.\r\nThe four suits of the _Briefe_ were neither Italian nor French in\r\ncharacter; they bore the name of _Schellen_, “bells” (Figs. 216, 217,\r\n218), or _roth_ (red), _grün_ (green), and _Eicheln_ (acorns) (Fig.\r\n219). The Germans, in their love of symbolism, had comprehended the real\r\noriginal signification of the game of cards, and although they\r\nintroduced many marked changes, they made it their study, at least in\r\nprinciple, to preserve its military characteristics. Their suits\r\ndepicted, it is said, the triumphs or the honours of war--the crowns of\r\noak-leaves or ivy, the bells were the bright insignia of the German\r\nnobility, and the purple was the recompense of their valiant warriors.\r\nThe Germans were careful not to admit ladies into the thoroughly warlike\r\ncompany of kings, captains (_ober_), and officers (_unter_). The ace was\r\nalways the flag, the warlike emblem _par excellence_; in addition to\r\nthis, the oldest game was the _Landsknecht_, or lansquenet (Fig. 220),\r\nthe distinctive term of the soldier.\r\n\r\nWe are speaking here only of the earliest German cards, for, after a\r\ncertain date, the essential form and emblematical rules of the pack\r\ndepended on nothing but the fancy and whim of the maker or the engraver.\r\nThe figures were but seldom designated by a proper name, but often bore\r\ndevices in German or Latin. Among the collections of ancient cards we\r\nfind one pack half German and half French, with the names of the Pagan\r\ngods. There are also several sets of cards with five suits (of fourteen\r\ncards each), among others those of “roses” and “pomegranates.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 220.--The “Two” of a Pack of German Lansquenet\r\nCards. (Bibl. Imp. of Paris.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 221.--Card from a Game of “Logic,” invented by Th.\r\nMurner, and copied from his “Chartiludium Logices.” (Cracow, 1507.)]\r\n\r\nThe Germans were the first who entertained the idea of applying cards to\r\nthe instruction of youth; and, as it were, of moralising a game of\r\nchance by making it express all the categories of scholastic science.\r\nThomas Murner, a Franciscan monk, and professor of philosophy, made in\r\n1507 an attempt of this kind (Fig. 221.) He designed a pack of\r\nfifty-two cards, divided into sixteen suits, corresponding to the same\r\nnumber of scholastic treatises; each card is covered with so many\r\nsymbols that a description would resemble the setting forth of some\r\nobscure riddle (_ténébreux logogriphe_). The German universities, which\r\nwere far from being dismayed at a little mysticism, were only the more\r\neager to study the arcana of grammar and logic while playing at cards.\r\nImitations of Murner’s cards were multiplied _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\nA game and pack of cards attributed to the celebrated Martin Schœngauer,\r\nor to one of his pupils, must also be dated in the fifteenth century.\r\nThe cards are distinguished by their form, number, and design; they are\r\nround in shape, and much resemble Persian cards, are painted on ivory\r\nand covered with arabesques, flowers, and birds. This pack, only a few\r\npieces of which now exist in some of the German collections, was\r\ncomposed of fifty-two cards divided into four numeral series of nine\r\ncards each, and with four figures in each series--the king, the queen,\r\nthe squire, and the knave. The suits or marks are the “Hare,” the\r\n“Parrot,” the “Carnation,” and the “Columbine.” Each of the aces\r\nrepresents the type of the suit, and they bear philosophical devices in\r\nLatin. The four figures of the “Parrot” suit are of African character;\r\nthose of the “Hare” are Asiatic or Turkish; those of the “Carnation” and\r\nthe “Columbine” belong to Europe. The “kings” and “queens” are on\r\nhorseback; the “squires” and “knaves” are so similar that it is\r\ndifficult to distinguish them, with the exception of the knaves of\r\n“Columbine” and “Carnation” (Figs. 222 to 227).\r\n\r\nThe English also were in possession of playing-cards at an early date,\r\nobtaining them through the medium of the trade which they carried on\r\nwith the Hanseatic towns and Holland; but they did not manufacture cards\r\nbefore the end of the sixteenth century; for we know that in the reign\r\nof Queen Elizabeth the Government retained in its own hands the monopoly\r\nof playing-cards, “which were imported from abroad.” The English, while\r\nadopting indiscriminately cards of a German, French, Italian, or Spanish\r\ncharacter, gave to the _valet_ the characteristic appellation of\r\n“knave.”[27]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 222 to 227.--German Round-shaped Cards, with the\r\nMonogram T.

Print-Room.)]\r\n\r\nWood-engraving, which was invented at the commencement of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and perhaps even before, must have been applied at the very\r\nfirst and almost simultaneously to the reproduction of sacred pictures\r\nand the manufacture of playing-cards. Holland and Germany have contended\r\nfor the honour of having been the cradle of this invention. Taking\r\nadvantage of this, they have also even thought themselves warranted in\r\nlaying claim to the credit of the original manufacture of cards;\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 229.--The Knight, from a Pack of Cards engraved by\r\n“The Master of 1466.” (Bibl. Imp. of Paris.)]\r\n\r\nwhereas the fact is that all they can claim is to have been the first to\r\nproduce them by some more expeditious method of making. According to the\r\nopinion of several _savants_, Laurent Coster of Haerlem was only an\r\nengraver of wood-blocks for cards and pictures, before he became a\r\nprinter of books. It certainly is a fact that wood-engraving, which was\r\nfor a long time limited to a few studios in Holland and Upper Germany,\r\nowed a large share of its progress to the trade in playing-cards--one\r\nwhich was carried on with such activity that, as we read in an old\r\nchronicle of the city of Ulm, about the year 1397, “they were in the\r\nhabit of sending playing-cards in bales to Italy, Sicily, and other\r\nsouthern countries, to exchange for groceries and various merchandise.”\r\n\r\nA few years later, engraving on metal or copper-plate was employed in\r\nproducing playing-cards of a really artistic character, among which we\r\nmay mention those of “The Master of 1466” (Figs. 228 and 229), and by\r\nhis anonymous rivals. The pack of cards of this engraver exists only in\r\na small number of print-collections, and it is in every case incomplete.\r\nAs far as we can judge, it must have been composed of sixty cards,\r\nconsisting of forty numeral cards divided into five series, and twenty\r\npicture-cards, being four to each series. The figures are the king,\r\nqueen, knight, and knave. The suits, or marks, present rather a strange\r\nselection of wild men, ferocious quadrupeds, deer, birds of prey, and\r\nvarious flowers. These objects are numerically grouped and tolerably\r\nwell arranged, so as to allow the numbers indicated to be distinguished\r\nat first sight.\r\n\r\nThus, as we have seen, playing-cards made their way through Arabia from\r\nIndia to Europe, where they first arrived about the year 1370. Within a\r\nfew years they spread from the south to the north of the latter country;\r\nbut those who, under the influence of a passion for play, had so eagerly\r\nwelcomed them, were far indeed from suspecting that this new game\r\ncontained within itself the germ of two of the most beautiful inventions\r\never devised by the human mind--those of engraving and printing. There\r\ncan be no doubt that playing-cards were in use for many a long year, ere\r\nthe public voice had proclaimed the almost simultaneous discovery of the\r\narts of engraving on wood and metal, and of printing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 230.--Coat of Arms of the Cardmakers of Paris.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLASS-PAINTING.\r\n\r\n     Painting on Glass mentioned by Historians in the Third Century of\r\n     our Era.--Glazed Windows at Brioude in the Sixth Century.--Coloured\r\n     Glass at St. John Lateran and St. Peter’s in Rome.--Church-Windows\r\n     of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries in France: Saint-Denis,\r\n     Sens, Poitiers, Chartres, Rheims, &c.--In the Fourteenth and\r\n     Fifteenth Centuries the Art was at its Zenith.--Jean Cousin.--The\r\n     Célestins of Paris; Saint-Gervais.--Robert Pinaigrier and his\r\n     Sons.--Bernard Palissy decorates the Chapel of the Castle of\r\n     Ecouen.--Foreign Art; Albert Dürer.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already established the fact that the art of manufacturing and\r\ncolouring glass was known to the most ancient nations; and, says\r\nChampollion-Figeac, “if we study the various fragments of this fragile\r\nsubstance that have been handed down to our time, if we take into\r\nconsideration the varied ornamentation with which they are covered, even\r\nthe human figures which some of them represent, it would be difficult to\r\nassert that antiquity was unacquainted with the means of combining glass\r\nwith painting. If antiquity did not produce what are now called\r\npainted-windows, the real cause doubtless was because the custom of\r\nemploying glass in windows did not then exist.” Some few specimens of it\r\nhave, however, been found in the windows of the houses exhumed at\r\nPompeii; but this must have been an exception, for the third century of\r\nour era is the earliest date in which traces are found in history of\r\nwindow-glass being used in buildings; and we must bring down our\r\nresearches as late as the times of St. John Chrysostom and St. Jerome\r\n(the fourth century) in order to find any reliable affirmation as to its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth century Gregory of Tours relates that a soldier broke the\r\nglass-window of a church at Brioude in order to enter it secretly and\r\ncommit robbery; and we know that when this prelate caused the\r\nrestoration of the Church of St. Martin of Tours, he took care to fill\r\nits windows with glass “of varied colours.” About the same time\r\nFortunatus, the poet-bishop of Poitiers, highly extols the splendour of\r\nthe glass-window of a church in Paris, the name of which he does not\r\nmention; but the learned investigations of Foncemagne with reference to\r\nthe first kings of France inform us that the church built at Paris by\r\nChildebert I. in honour of the Holy Cross and St. Vincent, as well as\r\nthe churches of Lyons and Bourges, were closed in with glass-windows. Du\r\nCange, in his “Constantinople Chrétienne,” describes the glass-windows\r\nof the basilica of St. Sophia, rebuilt by Justinian; and Paul, the\r\nSilentiary,[28] dwells with enthusiasm on the marvellous effect produced\r\nby the rays of the sun upon this assemblage of various coloured glasses.\r\n\r\nIn the eighth century, the epoch at which the use of glass-windows was\r\nbecoming general, the basilica of St. John Lateran and the Church of St.\r\nPeter at Rome possessed coloured glass-windows; and Charlemagne, who had\r\ncaused mosaics of coloured glass to be made in a large number of\r\nchurches, did not fail to avail himself of this kind of ornament in the\r\ncathedral erected by him at Aix-la-Chapelle.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the only method of making glass was in small pieces,\r\ngenerally round, and designated by the name of _cires_, a number of\r\nwhich by means of a network of plaster, wooden frames, or strips of\r\nlead, were used to fill up the windows. This material being, however,\r\nvery costly, it could only be introduced into edifices of great\r\nimportance. Added to this, it can scarcely be a source of wonder if, at\r\na time when all branches of art had relapsed into a sort of barbarism,\r\nand glass was only exceptionally employed in ordinary purposes, no one\r\nthought of decorating it with painted figures and ornaments.\r\n\r\nWith regard to mosaic, either in marble or coloured glass, Martial,\r\nLucretius, and other writers of antiquity, mention it in their works.\r\nEgypt had a knowledge of it even before Greece; the Romans were\r\naccustomed to employ it in ornamenting the roofs and pavement of their\r\ntemples, and even their columns and streets. Some magnificent specimens\r\nof these decorations have remained to our time, and they are considered\r\nas inseparable from the architecture of the emperors.\r\n\r\nSome have desired to attribute the custom of employing coloured glass in\r\nmosaics to the rarity of coloured marbles. Would it not be a more\r\nprobable hypothesis that the simultaneous use of marble and glass for\r\nthis purpose was the result of improvements in the art of making\r\nmosaics? for glass that, by metallic mixtures, may be brought to a\r\nvariety of colours, is much more easily adapted to pictorial\r\ncombinations than marble, the tints of which are the result of the\r\ncaprices of nature. Seneca, alluding to the use of coloured glasses in\r\nmosaic, complains of people not being able “to walk except on precious\r\nstones;” this shows how prevalent the use of rich mosaics had become in\r\nRome. But this art must have singularly fallen into decay, for the few\r\nexamples of the kind we now possess, which date from the first centuries\r\nof Christianity, are marked with a character of simplicity that fully\r\nharmonises with the rudeness of the artists of those times. Among these\r\nspecimens must be mentioned a pavement discovered at Rheims, upon which\r\nare represented the twelve signs of the zodiac, the seasons of the year,\r\nand Abraham’s Sacrifice; another on which are depicted Theseus and the\r\nlabyrinth of Crete, in juxtaposition with David and Goliath. It is,\r\nmoreover, known that there existed in the Forum of Naples a portrait in\r\nmosaic of Theodoric, king of the Goths, who had caused a representation\r\nof the Baptism of Christ to be executed, in the church of Ravenna, by\r\nthe same process. Sidonius Apollinaris, describing the excessive luxury\r\nof Consentius at Narbonne, speaks of arches and pavements ornamented\r\nwith mosaics. The churches of St. John Lateran, St. Clement, and St.\r\nGeorge in Velabro, at Rome, still display mosaics of this period.\r\nLastly, Charlemagne caused the greater part of the churches constructed\r\nby him to be ornamented with mosaics.\r\n\r\nTo return to glass-work, we find that in the time of Charles the Bald,\r\nin 863, mention is made of two artisans, Ragenat and Balderic, who\r\nbecame as it were the heads of the race of French glass-makers. We also\r\nlearn from the chronicle of St. Benignus of Dijon, that in 1052 there\r\nexisted in that church a “very ancient painted window,” representing St.\r\nPaschasie, which was said to have been taken from the earlier church. We\r\nhave therefore a right to conclude that at this period the custom of\r\npainting on glass had long been common.\r\n\r\nIn the tenth century glass-makers must have acquired some degree of\r\nimportance, for the reigning Dukes of Normandy of that era established\r\ncertain privileges in their favour; but, says Champollion-Figeac, “as\r\nall privilege was the prerogative of the order of nobility, they\r\ncontrived to give them to noble families whose fortunes were precarious.\r\nFour Norman families obtained this distinction. But although it was\r\nunderstood that in devoting themselves to the trade these titled\r\nindividuals incurred no degradation, it was never said, as is commonly\r\nbelieved, that the profession of this art conferred nobility; on the\r\ncontrary, a proverb arose which long continued in use, namely, that ‘in\r\norder to make a gentleman glass-maker, you must first take a\r\ngentleman.’”\r\n\r\nAlthough painting on glass was from that time carried on with\r\nconsiderable activity, in many cases it was still very far from being\r\naccomplished by the processes which were destined to make it one of the\r\nmost remarkable productions of art. The application of the brush to\r\nvitrifiable colours was not generally adopted. In the examples of this\r\nperiod that remain to our days, we indeed find large _cives_ cast in\r\nwhite glass, upon which characters were painted by the artist; but, as\r\nthe colour was not designed to be incorporated with the glass by the\r\naction of fire, with a view to ensure the preservation of the painting,\r\nanother transparent but thick _cive_ was placed over the first and\r\nclosely soldered to it.\r\n\r\nWhile glass-painting was thus seeking to perfect its processes, mosaic\r\nwork gradually declined. Only a very small number of mosaics of the\r\ntenth and eleventh centuries exist at the present day, and these,\r\nmoreover, are very incorrect in design, and entirely wanting in taste\r\nand colour.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century all the arts began to revive. The fear of the end\r\nof the world, which had thrown mankind into a strange state of\r\nperturbation, was dissipated. The Christian faith everywhere stirred up\r\nthe zeal of its disciples. Magnificent cathedrals with imposing arches\r\nsprang up in various places, and the art of the glass-maker came to the\r\naid of architecture in order to diffuse over the interiors consecrated\r\nto worship the light, both prismatic and harmonious, which affords the\r\ncalm, necessary for holy meditation. But though, in the painted windows\r\nof this period, we are forced to admire the ingenious combinatian of\r\ncolours for the rose-work (rose-windows), the case is very different as\r\nregards the drawing and colouring of the designs. The figures are\r\ngenerally traced in rough, stiff lines on glass of a dull tint, which\r\nabsorbs all the expression of the heads; the entire drapery of the\r\ncostume is heavy; the figure is spoilt by the folds of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 231.--St. Timothy the Martyr, Coloured Glass of the\r\nend of the Eleventh Century, found in the Church of Neuwiller (Bas-Rhin)\r\nby M. Bœswillwald. (From the “History of Glass-Painting,” by M.\r\nLasteyrie.)]\r\n\r\nits vestments as if it were enclosed in a long sheath. This is the\r\ngeneral character of the examples of that period as they are known to us\r\n(Fig. 231).\r\n\r\nThe painted windows which Suger made to adorn the abbey-church of St.\r\nDenis, some of which exist in our days, date from the twelfth century.\r\nThe abbot made inquiries in every country, and gathered together at a\r\ngreat expense the best artists he could find, in order to assist in this\r\ndecoration. The Adoration of the Magi, the Annunciation, the History of\r\nMoses, and various allegories, are there represented in the chapel of\r\nthe Virgin and those of St. Osman and St. Hilary. Among the principal\r\npictures may be also observed a portrait of Suger himself at the feet of\r\nthe Virgin. The borders surrounding the subjects may be considered as\r\nmodels of harmony and good arrangement of effect; but still the taste\r\nshown in the selection and combination of colours is carried to the\r\nhighest point in the subjects themselves, the designs of which are very\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nIn the Church of St. Maurice, at Angers, we find examples of a rather\r\nearlier date--perhaps the most ancient specimens of painted windows in\r\nFrance; these are the history of St. Catherine and that of the Virgin,\r\nwhich, in truth, are not equal in merit, as regards execution and taste,\r\nto the ancient windows of the Church of St. Denis.\r\n\r\nWe still have to mention some fragments contained in the Church of St.\r\nSerge, and the chapel of the Hospital, in the town of Angers; also a\r\nglass-window in the Abbey of Fontevrault; another in the Church of St.\r\nPeter, at Dreux, in which is represented Queen Anne of Brittany. We\r\nwill, in conclusion, mention one of the windows of the choir in the\r\nChurch of the Trinity, at Vendôme; it represents the Glorification of\r\nthe Virgin, who bears on her forehead an aureola, the shape of which,\r\ncalled _amandaire_,[29] has furnished archæologists with a subject for\r\nlong discussions; some being desirous of proving that this aureola,\r\nwhich does not appear to be depicted in the same way on any other\r\npainted window, tends to show that the works of the Poitevine\r\nglass-makers, to whom it is attributed, had been subject to the\r\ninfluence of the Byzantine school; others assert that the almond-shaped\r\ncrown is a symbol exclusively reserved for the Virgin. Before we proceed\r\nto the examples handed down to us from the twelfth century, we must\r\nmention some remains of glass to be seen at Chartres, Mans, Sens, and\r\nBourges (Fig. 232), &c. We may also add, as an incident not without\r\ninterest, that a chapter of the order of the Cistercians, considering\r\nthe great expense to which the acquisition of painted windows led,\r\nprohibited the use of them in churches under the rule of St. Bernard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 232.--Fragment of a Church-window, representing the\r\n“Prodigal Son.” Thirteenth Century. (Presented to the Cathedral of\r\nBourges by the Guild of Tanners.)]\r\n\r\n“The architecture of the thirteenth century,” according to the judicious\r\nremarks of Champollion-Figeac, “by its style of moulding, which is more\r\nslender and graceful than the massive forms of Roman art, opened a\r\nwider and more favourable field for artists in glass. The small pillars\r\nthen projected, and extended themselves with a novel elegance, and the\r\ntapering and delicate spires of the steeples lost themselves in the\r\nclouds. The windows occupied more space, and likewise had the appearance\r\nof springing lightly and gracefully upwards. They were adorned with\r\nsymbolical ornaments, griffins, and other fantastic animals; leaves and\r\nboughs cross and intertwine with one another, producing that varied\r\nrose-work which is the admiration of modern glass-makers. The colours\r\nare more skilfully combined and better blended than in the windows of\r\nthe preceding century; and although some of the figures are still\r\nwanting in expression, and have not thrown off all the stiffness which\r\ncharacterised them, the draperies, at least, are lighter and better\r\ndrawn.” Examples of the thirteenth century which have remained to our\r\ntime are very numerous. There is at Poitiers some painted glass composed\r\nof small roses, and chiefly placed in one of the windows in the centre\r\nof the church and in the “Calvary” of the apse; at Sens, the legend of\r\nSt. Thomas of Canterbury is represented in a number of small medallions,\r\ncalled _verrières légendaires_; at Mans is glass representing the\r\ncorporations of trades; at Chartres, the painted glass in the cathedral,\r\na work both magnificent and extensive, contains no fewer than one\r\nthousand three hundred and fifty subjects, distributed throughout one\r\nhundred and forty-three windows. At Rheims, the painted glass is perhaps\r\nless important, but it is remarkable both for the brilliancy of its\r\ncolours and also for its characteristic fitness to the style of the\r\nedifice. Bourges, Tours, Angers, and Notre-Dame in Paris, present very\r\nbeautiful specimens. The Cathedral of Rouen possesses, to this day, a\r\nwindow which bears the name of Clement of Chartres, _master glazier_,\r\nthe first artist of this kind who has left behind him any work bearing\r\nhis signature. We must, in conclusion, mention the Sainte-Chapelle,\r\nParis, which is unquestionably the highest representation of what the\r\nart is capable of producing. The designs of the windows in this last\r\nedifice are _legendary_, and although some few inaccuracies may be\r\nnoticed in the figures, the fault is redeemed by the studied elegance of\r\nthe ornamentation and the harmony of colours, which combine to render\r\nthem one of the most consistent and perfect works of painting on glass.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century “_grisaille_” first made its appearance; it\r\nwas quite a new style, and has been often since employed in the borders\r\nand ornaments of painted windows. “_Grisaille_,”[30] the name of which\r\nis to some extent sufficient to describe its aspect, was used\r\nsimultaneously with the mosaics of variegated glass, as we see in the\r\nChurch of St. Thomas, Strasbourg, in the Cathedral of Freybourg in\r\nBrisgau, and in many churches of Bourges.\r\n\r\nThe large number of paintings on glass belonging to the thirteenth\r\ncentury, which may still be studied in various churches, has given rise\r\nto the idea of classifying all these monuments, and arranging them under\r\ncertain schools, which have been designated by the names of\r\n_Franco-Norman_, _Germanic_, &c. Some have even gone further, and\r\ndesired to recognise in the style peculiar to the artists of ancient\r\nFrance a Norman style, a Poitevin style (the latter recognisable, it is\r\nsaid, by the want of harmony in the colours), &c. We can hardly admit\r\nthese last distinctions, and are the less inclined to do so, as those\r\nwho propound them seem to base their theories rather on the defects than\r\nthe good qualities of the artists. Besides, at a period in which a\r\nnobleman sometimes possessed several provinces very distant from each\r\nother--as, for example, Anjou and Provence--it might so happen that the\r\nartists he took with him to his different residences could scarcely\r\nfail, by the union of their various works, to cause any provincial\r\ninfluences to disappear, and would finally reduce the distinction\r\nbetween what is called the Poitevin style, the Norman style, &c., to a\r\nquestion of a more or less skilful manufacture, or of a more or less\r\nadvanced improvement.\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century the artist in glass became separated from the\r\narchitect; although naturally subordinate to the designer of the\r\nedifice, in which the windows were to be only an accessory ornament, he\r\nwished to give effect to his own inspiration. The whole of the building\r\nwas subjected by him to the effect of his more learned and correct\r\ndrawing, and his purer and more striking colouring. It mattered little\r\nto him should some part of the church have too much light, or not light\r\nenough, if a flood of radiance deluged the apse or the choir, instead of\r\nbeing gradually diffused everywhere, as in earlier buildings. He desired\r\nhis labour to recommend him, and his work to do him honour.\r\n\r\nThe court-poets, Guillaume de Machaut and Eustache Deschamps, celebrate\r\nin their poems several works in painted glass of their time, and even\r\ngive some details in verse on the mode of fabricating them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 233.--Legend of the Jew of the Rue des Billettes,\r\nParis, piercing the Holy Wafer with his Knife. (From a Window of the\r\nChurch of St. Alpin, at Châlons-sur-Marne. Fourteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nIn 1347 a royal ordinance was proclaimed in favour of the workmen of\r\nLyons. The custom existed at that time of adorning with painted windows\r\nroyal and lordly habitations. The artists produced their own designs,\r\nadapting them to the use that was made, in private life, of the halls\r\nfor which they were intended. Some of these windows representing\r\nfamiliar legends adorned even the churches (Fig. 233).\r\n\r\nAmong the most important works of the fourteenth century, we must\r\nmention in the first place the windows of the cathedrals of Mans,\r\nBeauvais, Évreux (Fig. 234), and the rose-windows of St. Thomas at\r\nStrasbourg. Next come the windows of the Church of St. Nazaire at\r\nCarcassonne and of the Cathedral of Narbonne. There are, besides, in the\r\nChurch of St. John at Lyons, in Notre-Dame of Semur, in Aix in Provence,\r\nat Bourges, and at Metz, church-windows in every respect worthy of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 234.--Fragment of a Window presented to the\r\nCathedral of Evreux by the Bishop Guillaume de Cantiers. Fourteenth\r\nCentury.]\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century only continues the traditions of the preceding\r\none. The principal works dating from this epoch begin, according to the\r\norder of merit, with the window of the Cathedral of Mans, which\r\nrepresents Yolande[31] of Aragon, and Louis II., King of Naples and\r\nSicily, ancestors of the good King René; after them we shall place the\r\nwindows of the Sainte-Chapelle, Riom; St. Vincent, Rouen; the Cathedral\r\nof Tours; and that of Bourges, representing a memorial of Jacques Cœur,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth century, although bringing with it, owing to religious\r\ntroubles, many ravages of new iconoclasts, has handed down to us a\r\nvariety of numerous and remarkable church-windows. We are, of course,\r\nunable to mention them all; but it seems expedient--adopting the rule of\r\nmost archæologists--to divide them into three branches or schools, which\r\nare actually formed by the different styles of the artists of that\r\nepoch; the French school, the German school, and the Lorraine school\r\n(Fig. 235), which partakes of the characteristics of the two preceding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 235.--Allegorical Window, representing the “Citadel\r\nof Pallas.” (Lorraine work of the Sixteenth Century, preserved in the\r\nLibrary at Strasbourg.)]\r\n\r\nAt the head of the French school figures the celebrated Jean Cousin, who\r\ndecorated the chapel of Vincennes; he also made for the Célestins\r\nmonastery, Paris, a representation of Calvary; for St. Gervais, in\r\n1587, the windows representing the “Martyrdom of St. Lawrence,” the\r\n“Samaritan conversing with Christ,” and the “Paralytic.” In these works,\r\nwhich belong to a high style of painting, the best method of\r\narrangement, vigorous drawing, and powerful colouring, seem to reflect\r\nthe work of Raphael. Windows in “_grisaille_,” made from the cartoons of\r\nJean Cousin, also decorated the Castle of Anet.\r\n\r\nAnother artist, named Robert Pinaigrier, who, although inferior to\r\nCousin, was much more fertile in production, assisted by his sons Jean,\r\nNicholas, and Louis, and several of his pupils, executed a number of\r\nwindows for the churches of Paris, of which the greater part have\r\ndisappeared: Saint-Jacques la Boucherie, the Madeleine, Sainte-Croix en\r\nla Cité, Saint Barthélemy, &c. Magnificent specimens of his work still\r\nremain at Saint-Merry, Saint-Gervais, Saint-Etienne du Mont, and in the\r\nCathedral of Chartres. Pinaigrier’s works in the decorations of châteaux\r\nand the mansions of the nobility are perhaps equally numerous.\r\n\r\nAt this period several windows were made from the drawings of Raphael,\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, and Parmigiano; it may also be remarked that two\r\npatterns of the latter’s work were used by Bernard Palissy, who was a\r\nglass-maker before he became an enameller, in forming windows in\r\n“_grisaille_” for the chapel of the Château of Ecouen. For the same\r\nplace, following the style of Raphael, and from the drawings of Rosso,\r\ncalled _Maître Roux_, Bernard Palissy executed thirty pictures on glass,\r\nrepresenting the history of Psyche, which are justly considered as\r\nranking among the most beautiful compositions of the epoch; but it is\r\nnot now known what has become of these valuable windows, which at the\r\nRevolution were transported to the Museum of French Monuments.\r\n\r\nThey were, it is said, executed under the direction of Leonard of\r\nLimoges, who, like all the masters of that school (Fig. 236), applied to\r\npainting on glass the processes of enamelling, and _vice versâ_. In the\r\ncollections of the Louvre and of several amateurs, there are still\r\nexamples of his composition, on which he employed the best\r\nglass-painters of his time; for he could not himself work on all the\r\nobjects that proceeded from his studios, and which were almost\r\nexclusively destined for the king’s palace.\r\n\r\nThe French art of glass-working became cosmopolitan. It was introduced\r\ninto Spain and also into the Low Countries under the protection of\r\nCharles V. and the Duke of Alba. It even appears to have crossed the\r\nAlps; for we know that in 1512 a glass-painter of the name of Claude\r\nadorned with his works the large windows of the Vatican; and Julius II.\r\nsummoned Guillaume of Marseilles to the Eternal City, the pontiff when\r\noccupying the sees of Carpentras and Avignon having appreciated his\r\ntalent. We must not omit to mention, among the Flemish artists who\r\nescaped this foreign influence, the name of Dirk of Haarlem (Fig. 237),\r\nthe most celebrated master in this art at the close of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 236.--St. Paul, an Enamel of Limoges, by Etienne\r\nMercier.]\r\n\r\nWhile French art was thus spreading over the continent, foreign art\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 237.--Flemish Window (Fifteenth Century), half\r\nlife-size. Painted in Monochrome, relieved with yellow, by Dirk of\r\nHaarlem. (Collection of M. Benoni-Verhelst, Ghent.)]\r\n\r\nwas being introduced into France. Albert Dürer employed his pencil in\r\npainting twenty windows in the church of the Old Temple, in Paris, and\r\nproduced a collection of pictures characterised by vigorous drawing, and\r\nwarm and intense colouring. The celebrated German did not work\r\nalone--other artists assisted him; and, notwithstanding the devastations\r\nwhich took place during the Revolution, in many a church and mansion\r\ntraces of these skilful masters may still be found; their compositions,\r\nwhich are generally as well arranged as they are executed, are marked\r\nwith a tinge of German simplicity very suitable to the pious nature of\r\nthe subjects they represent.\r\n\r\nIn 1600, Nicholas Pinaigrier placed in the windows of the Castle of La\r\nBriffe seven pictures in “_grisaille_,” copied from the designs of\r\nFrancis Floris, a Flemish master, who was born in 1520. At this same\r\nperiod Van Haeck, Herreyn, John Dox, and Pelgrin Rösen, all belonging to\r\nthe school of Antwerp, and other artists who had decorated the windows\r\nof most of the churches in Belgium, especially St. Gudule in Brussels,\r\ninfluenced either directly or indirectly the glass-painters of the east\r\nand north of France. Another group of artists, the Provençals, imitators\r\nof the Italian style, or rather perhaps inspired by the same luminary,\r\nthe sun of Michael Angelo, trod a similar path to that which Jean\r\nCousin, Pinaigrier, and Palissy had followed with so much renown. The\r\nchiefs of this school were Claude, and Guillaume of Marseilles, who, as\r\nwe have just mentioned, carried their talent and their works into Italy,\r\nwhere they succeeded in educating some clever pupils.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the school of Messin or Lorraine, it is principally\r\nrepresented by a disciple of Michael Angelo, Valentin Bousch, the\r\nAlsatian, who died in 1541 at Metz, where he had executed, since 1521,\r\nan immense number of works. The windows of the churches of St. Barbe,\r\nSt. Nicolas du Port, Autrey, and Flavigny-sur-Moselle, are due to the\r\nsame school, in which Israel Henriet was also brought up; he became the\r\nchief of a school exclusively belonging to Lorraine, at the time when\r\nCharles III. had invited the arts to unite under the patronage of the\r\nducal throne. Thierry Alix, in a “Description inédite de la Lorraine,”\r\nwritten in 1590, and mentioned by M. Bégin, speaks of “large plates of\r\nglass of all colours,” made in his time in the mountains of Vosges,\r\nwhere “all the herbs and other things necessary to painting” were found.\r\nM. Bégin, after having quoted this curious statement, adds that the\r\nwindows which at that era were produced in the studios of Vosges, and\r\nsubsequently carried to all parts of Europe, constituted a very active\r\nbranch of commerce.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” says Champollion-Figeac, “art was declining. Christian\r\nart especially was disappearing, and had almost come to an end, when\r\nProtestantism stepped in and gave it the last blow; this is proved by\r\nthe window in the cathedral church of Berne, in which the artist,\r\nFrederic\r\n\r\n     “FRANCIS I.

FROM\r\n     “L’HISTOIRE DE LA PEINTURE SUR VERRE EN EUROPE.”\r\n\r\n     This magnificent window was given to the Church of St. Gudule by\r\n     Francis I. and Eleanor of Spain, his wife, sister of Charles V.,\r\n     and widow by her first marriage of Emmanuel the Great, King of\r\n     Portugal.\r\n\r\n     The donors are represented kneeling, each one protected by his or\r\n     her patron saint; the king is attended by St. Francis of Assisi,\r\n     who is receiving in a vision the impress of the stigmata of Jesus\r\n     on the Cross; the queen is accompanied by St. Eleanor, who holds in\r\n     her hand the palm of the elect. This window is from a design by\r\n     Bernard van Orley.\r\n\r\n     Francis I. and Eleanor expended on the window two hundred and\r\n     twenty-two crowns, or four hundred florins, an important sum in\r\n     those days (1515-47).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCIS I.

Ernest Breton, “the word _fresco_ is made\r\nsynonymous with mural painting in general. This confusion of terms has\r\nsometimes caused the most fatal errors. The etymology of the word is the\r\nbest definition of the subject. The Italians give the name of paintings\r\n_in fresco_ or _a fresco_, that is to say, _à frais_, or _sur le frais_,\r\nto those works executed upon damp stucco into which the colour\r\npenetrates to a certain depth. The ancient French authors, preserving\r\nthe difference existing between the Italian _fresco_ and the French\r\n_frais_, wrote the word _fraisque_. At the present day Italian\r\northography has prevailed, and with us this word has now more relation\r\nto its etymology than its real signification.”\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the common acceptation of the word, we must, in order to\r\nkeep within the limits of our subject, here only take into consideration\r\nreal frescoes, or in other words, works of art executed upon a bare\r\nwall, properly prepared for the purpose, with which they are as it were\r\nincorporated; for in the roll of art all are excluded from the catalogue\r\nof mural paintings, rightly so called, which, although applied to walls\r\neither directly or by the aid of panels or fixed canvas, are produced\r\notherwise than with water-colours, and used in such a manner as to\r\npenetrate the special kind of plaster with which the wall had been\r\npreviously covered. We will mention as a striking example of this the\r\nfamous “Lord’s Supper” of Leonardo da Vinci, which has many times been\r\ncalled a fresco (it is well known to have been painted upon the wall of\r\nthe refectory of Santa Maria della Gratia, at Milan), but is nothing but\r\na painting in distemper[32] on a dry partition--a circumstance,\r\nby-the-bye, which has not a little contributed to the deterioration of\r\nthis magnificent work.\r\n\r\nFresco has long been considered the most ancient style of painting.\r\nVasari, who wrote in the middle of the sixteenth century, says in apt\r\nterms that “the ancients generally practised painting _in fresco_, and\r\nthe first painters of the modern schools have only followed the antique\r\nmethods;” and, in our own day, Millin, in his “Dictionnaire des\r\nBeaux-Arts,” asserts that the great paintings in the “Pœcile” of Athens\r\nand the “Lesche” of Delphi, by Panænus and Polygnotus, spoken of by\r\nPausanias, were executed by this process; the same author also ranks\r\namong frescoes the numerous paintings left by the Egyptians in their\r\ntemples and catacombs. “It was,” he remarks, “what the Romans called _in\r\nudo pariete pingere_ (to paint on a damp wall); they say _in cretula\r\npingere_ (to paint on chalk) to designate water-colour painting on a dry\r\nground.”\r\n\r\nSome persons have considered the paintings found at Herculaneum and\r\nPompeii to be frescoes; nevertheless Winckelmann, who is an authority in\r\nthese matters, said, a hundred years ago, in speaking of those works,\r\n“It is to be remarked that the greater part of these pictures were not\r\npainted on damp lime, but upon a dry ground, which is rendered very\r\nevident by several of the figures having scaled off in such a way as to\r\nshow distinctly the ground upon which they rest.”\r\n\r\nThe whole mistake has arisen from taking the expression “_in udo\r\npariete_,” found in Pliny, in too literal a sense; the error, which\r\nmight at all events have been dissipated by an attentive examination of\r\nthe examples themselves, would not have lasted long if the passage from\r\nPliny had been compared with a statement of Vitruvius, which informs us\r\nthat they applied to fresh walls uniform tints of black, blue, yellow,\r\nor red, which were destined to form the grounds of paintings, or even\r\nallowed them to remain plain, like our present coloured walls. The\r\nemployment of this process may also be easily recognised in the\r\npaintings of Pompeii, where this uniform colouring has sometimes\r\npenetrated nearly an inch into the stucco of the wall. On this ground,\r\nwhen it was perfectly dry, ornamental subjects were painted either in\r\ndistemper or encaustic.\r\n\r\nThus, therefore, it is shown that the process of painting _in fresco_\r\nwas unknown to the ancients, and was invented by artists of succeeding\r\ntimes; but it would be difficult to assign any precise date to this\r\ninvention; for however far we go back, we do not find any authors who\r\nfix the epoch at which the new method was for the first time followed.\r\nWe are, therefore, compelled to notice the age of some particular\r\nexample which shows that the discovery had then taken place, without\r\nbeing able to determine the exact date of its commencement.\r\n\r\nPainting, which with the Greeks attained its greatest height in the\r\nreign of Alexander, fell, says M. Breton, “with the power of Greece. In\r\nlosing its liberty, the country of the Fine Arts lost, too, the\r\nperception of the beautiful.” At Rome, painting never reached the same\r\ndegree of perfection as it did in Greece; for a long time it was only\r\npractised by men of the lowest rank and by slaves. A few patricians,\r\nsuch as Amulius, Fabius _Pictor_ (painter), and Cornelius Pinus, were,\r\nat the best, able to bring about only some slight revival. After the\r\ntwelve Cæsars, painting followed the movement of decadence which carried\r\naway with it all the arts; like them, it received its death-blow in the\r\nfourth century, on the day when Constantine, quitting Rome in order to\r\nestablish the seat of empire at Byzantium, took with him into his new\r\ncapital not only the best artists, but also a prodigious number of their\r\nproductions, and of those of the artists who preceded them. Several\r\nother causes may also be mentioned as having led to the decline of art,\r\nor to the destruction of examples which would now bear witness to its\r\npower in remote ages. In the first place, there was the birth of\r\nChristian Art, which rose on the ruins of Paganism; then, the invasion\r\nof barbarians which took place in the fifth century; lastly, in the\r\neighth and ninth centuries, the fury of the Iconoclasts, or\r\nImage-breakers, a sect at the head of which figured several emperors of\r\nthe East, from Leo the Isaurian, who reigned in 717, down to Michael\r\nthe Stammerer and Theophilus, who respectively ascended the imperial\r\nthrone in 820 and 829.\r\n\r\nEven among the ignorant masses, to whom we owe the loss of so many\r\n_chefs-d’œuvre_, were some individuals who formed honourable exceptions,\r\nnot only by opposing the devastations, but also by manifesting a\r\nlaudable conservative instinct. Cassiodorus tells us that Theodoric,\r\nking of the Goths, re-established the office of _centurio nitentium\r\nrerum_ (guardian of beautiful objects), instituted by the emperor\r\nConstantius; and we know that the Lombard kings who succeeded this\r\nprince and reigned in Italy for 218 years, although less zealous in the\r\nculture of the arts, did not fail to honour and protect them. In Paul\r\nthe Deacon[33] we read that, in the sixth century, queen Teudelinde,\r\nwife of Autharis and afterwards of Agilulphus, caused the valorous deeds\r\nof the first Lombard kings to be painted on the _basilica_ that she had\r\nconsecrated at Monza under the name of St. John. Other paintings of the\r\nsame epoch may still be seen at Pavia. The Church of St. Nazaire at\r\nVerona possesses in its crypt paintings spoken of by Maffei, which have\r\nbeen engraved by Ciampini and Frisi: these must date back to the sixth\r\nand seventh centuries. Lastly, they have recently found in the\r\nsubterranean chapel of the _basilica_ of St. Clement, in Rome, some\r\nadmirable mural paintings, which archæologists refer to the same epoch.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern artists, driven away by the persecutions of the Iconoclasts,\r\nsought an asylum in Italy, where the Latin Church, obedient to the\r\nprescriptions of the Council of Nice, seemed determined to multiply\r\nsacred images as much as possible. The arrival of the Grecian artists in\r\nthe West was also singularly promoted by the commercial relations which\r\nfrom that time were established between all points of the Mediterranean\r\nshore and the maritime or mercantile towns of Italy--Pisa, Genoa, and\r\nVenice. Thus was brought about the movement which, although taking place\r\non Italian soil, drew from an entirely Eastern source the inspiration of\r\nthe revival of the Fine Arts; thus was continued the so-called Byzantine\r\nschool, destined to be the foundation of all modern art.\r\n\r\nIn 817 some Greek artists, by order of Pope Pascal I., executed under\r\nthe portico of the Church of St. Cecilia in Rome a series of frescoes,\r\nthe subjects of which were taken from the life of the saint. To the same\r\nschool we are indebted for the sitting figures of Christ and His mother\r\n(Fig. 239), in the old Church of Santa-Maria Trans-Tiberia, in Rome; the\r\nlarge Madonna painted on the walls of Santa-Maria della Scala, Milan,\r\nwhich, at the time when this church was destroyed and replaced by the\r\ntheatre of La Scala, was taken away and carried to the Church of\r\nSanta-Fidelia, where it still remains; a series of portraits of the\r\nPopes after St. Leo, a collection of which a large portion perished in\r\nthe fire of St. Paul-extra-Muros, Rome (Fig. 240); and lastly, the\r\npaintings in the vaults of the Cathedral of Aquila.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 239.--Christ and His Mother. Fresco-Painting of the\r\nNinth Century, in the Apse of Santa-Maria Trans-Tiberia, Rome.]\r\n\r\n“The works of these earliest painters,” observes M. Breton, “seem to\r\nmark the transition from painting to sculpture: they are long figures as\r\nstiff as columns, single or arranged symmetrically, forming neither\r\ngroups nor compositions, without perspective or effects of light and\r\nshade, and having nothing to express their meaning than a sort of legend\r\nproceeding out of the mouths of the characters. These frescoes, which\r\nare so weak when looked at in an artistic point of view, are remarkable\r\nfor their material execution, being extremely solid in their\r\nworkmanship. It is astonishing to see the wonderful preservation of some\r\npictures of saints that adorn the pilasters of St. Nicholas in Treviso\r\nand the walls of the church in Fiesole, whereon are preserved the\r\nfrescoes of Fra Angelico.”\r\n\r\nAmong the paintings remaining to our time, the first in which the\r\nauthors departed from the uniform style of the Byzantine masters are\r\nthose which adorn the interior of the ancient temple of Bacchus, now the\r\nChurch of St. Urban in the Campagna of Rome: there is nothing Grecian\r\neither in the figures or draperies, and it is impossible not to\r\nrecognise in them an Italian pencil; the date, however, is 1011. Pesaro,\r\nAquila, Orvieto, and Fiesole, possess examples of the same epoch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 240.--Portrait of the Pope Sylvester I.\r\nFresco-Painting in Mosaic, on a gold ground, in the Basilica of St.\r\nPaul-extra-Muros, Rome.]\r\n\r\nAt last, in the thirteenth century, notwithstanding its fierce intestine\r\nstruggles, Italy, and especially Tuscany, witnessed the dawn of the sun\r\nof the Fine Arts, which, after a long period of darkness, was to shine\r\nwith so much brilliancy over the whole world. Pisa and Siena, earliest\r\nin the revival, gave birth respectively to Giunta and Guido\r\n(Palmerucci), each of whom in his time acquired great renown; but the\r\nonly works of these artists which remain now, in the Cathedral of\r\nAssisi, seem but to indicate a desire of progress without manifesting\r\nany real advancement in art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 241.--The Apostles in the Garden of Gethsemane.\r\nFresco by Berna, at San-Geminiano. (Fourteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nTo Guido of Siena succeeds, but not immediately, the friend of\r\nPetrarch, Simon Memmi, whose frescoes in the Campo Santo of Pisa\r\ntestify to his powerful genius, and denote the first remarkable stage of\r\nart.\r\n\r\nIn the collegiate church of San-Geminiano[34] may be still seen a fresco\r\nby Berna (Fig. 241), an eminent master in the school of Siena, who died\r\nin 1370.\r\n\r\nPassing, but not without mention, Margaritone and Bonaventura\r\nBerlinghieri, who were only the timid harbingers of a great\r\nindividuality, the Florentine school places in the first rank of its\r\ncelebrities Cimabue (1240-1300), justly regarded by the artistic world\r\nas the true restorer of painting. Cimabue pointed out the path; Giotto,\r\nhis pupil, trod it. He took nature for his guide, and has been surnamed\r\n“nature’s pupil.” Real imitation was the object of his endeavour, and as\r\nhe found this system marvellously applied in the beautiful antique\r\nmarbles which had already inspired, in the preceding century, the\r\nsculptors John and Nicolas of Pisa, he made an earnest study of these\r\nancient _chefs-d’œuvre_. The impulse was given, and the Campo Santo of\r\nPisa shows us its first results in “The Dream of Life.”\r\n\r\nFor two centuries there was a slow but always progressive improvement,\r\nowing to the industry of Buffamalco, Taddeo Gaddi, Orcagna, Spinello of\r\nLucca, and Masolino of Panicale. With the fifteenth century appeared Fra\r\nAngelico of Fiesole (Figs. 242 and 246), and Benozzo Gozzoli; then\r\nMasaccio, Pisanello, Mantegna, Zingaro, Pinturicchio, and lastly\r\nPerugino, the Master of the divine Raphael. In the sixteenth century art\r\nattained its culminating point. At this epoch Raphael and his pupils\r\npainted the “Farnesina” and the “Stanze” and “Loggie” of the Vatican (it\r\nis known that the two first pictures of the “Loggie” (Fig. 243) were\r\npainted solely by the hand of Raphael); Michael Angelo alone executed\r\nthe immense expanse of the “Last Judgment,” and Paul Veronese painted\r\nthe ceilings of the palace of the Doges at Venice. Then Giulio Romano\r\ncovered with his works the walls of the Te palace at Mantua; Andrea del\r\nSarto, those of the “Annunziata” and “Dello Scalzo” at Florence. Daniel\r\nof Volterra painted his famous “Descent from the Cross” for the Trinité\r\ndu Mont, Rome; at Parma, the Pencil of Correggio worked marvels on the\r\ncircle of the dome of the cathedral. Leonardo da Vinci, besides the\r\npicture of the “Lord’s Supper,” which we before mentioned only to\r\nexclude it from the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “THE DREAM OF LIFE.”\r\n\r\nFRESCO-PAINTING, BY ORCAGNA, IN THE CLOISTER OF THE CAMPO SANTO OF PISA.\r\n(FOURTEENTH CENTURY.)\r\n\r\nThis fresco is by Andrea Cione, called Orcagna, a Florentine painter of\r\nthe fourteenth century, who executed for the Campo Santo of Pisa a\r\nseries of paintings which are still admired, representing the four\r\ndestinies of man:--“Death,” “Judgment,” “Hell,” and “Paradise.” Each of\r\nthese large compositions embraces several scenes; that which we give\r\nbelongs to the “Triumph of Death.”\r\n\r\nPetrarch had just given to the world the concluding notes of his\r\nfunereal song, and the wish of the painter seems to have been to call to\r\nlife, in his fresco, the strange vision of the poet. The happy of this\r\nworld are here represented gathered together under cool shades and upon\r\ncarpets of verdure; gay lords are murmuring magic words into the ears of\r\nthe young ladies of Florence. Even quiet falcons on the wrists of the\r\nlords seem captivated by this delicious music. Everything appears to\r\ninvite forgetfulness of the miseries of life,--the richness of the\r\nvestments, the beautiful sky of Italy, the perfumes, the love-songs....\r\nThis is the “Dream of Life,” which “Death” is destined to dispel with\r\none sweep of his mighty wing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DREAM OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n(After a Copy made for the Library of M Ambroise Firmin Didot.) From a\r\nfresco Painting by Orcagna, in the Cloister of the Campo Santo of Pisa.\r\nFourteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nnumber of frescoes, endowed the monastery of St Onofrio at Rome with a\r\nmagnificent Madonna, and the palace of Caravaggio, near Bergamo, with\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 242.--Group of Saints, taken from the large Fresco\r\nof “The Passion” in the Convent of St. Mark. Painted by Fra Angelico of\r\nFiesole.]\r\n\r\na colossal Virgin. It was, in short, the age of splendid productions in\r\nmural painting, that in which the great Buonarotti exclaimed\r\nwhen engaged in enthusiastic labour on one of his sublime\r\nconceptions--“Fresco is the only painting; painting in oils is only the\r\nart of women and idle and unenergetic men.” And yet, at least as regards\r\nimprovements in the process of execution, fresco had hardly reached its\r\nclimax.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century the school of Bologna, after having for a\r\nlong time maintained a merely imitative style of art, shone forth with\r\nindependent light under the influence of the Carracci, who, summoned to\r\nRome, covered the walls of the Farnesian gallery with frescoes, to which\r\nnone others could be compared for brilliancy and powerful effect. As\r\nmuch must be said of the works of their pupils: the “Martyrdom of St.\r\nSebastian,” in the Church of St. Mary of the Angels; the “Miracles of\r\nSt. Nil,” at Grotta-Ferrata, near Rome; the “Death of St. Cecilia,” at\r\nSaint-Louis-des-Français, by Domenichino; “Aurora,” by Guercino, at the\r\nVilla Ludovici; the “Chariot of the Sun,” by Guido, in the Rospigliosi\r\nPalace, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 243.--First Picture of the Loggie of Raphael--“God\r\ncreating the Heaven and the Earth.”]\r\n\r\nLuca Giordano, a Neapolitan painter, founder of the gallery of the\r\nRicciardi Palace at Florence, and author of the frescoes in numerous\r\nchurches in Italy and Spain, must not be forgotten; and with him must\r\nbe mentioned Pietro da Cortona, of the Roman school, who especially\r\ndistinguished himself in the ceilings of the Barberini Palace, at Rome.\r\n\r\nWe still have to mention the fertile painters of the Genoese and\r\nParmesan schools--Lanfranc, Carloni, and Francavilla; but the hour of\r\ndecadence had come when these artists appeared; they had more boldness\r\nthan talent, they aimed at the majestic, but only succeeded in attaining\r\nto the gigantic; their pencils were skilful, but their soul lacked\r\nfervour and conviction; in spite of their efforts, fresco-painting\r\ndeclined under their hands, and since that time has only decayed and\r\ngradually sunk into oblivion.\r\n\r\nWe must not quit the classical ground of the Fine Arts without\r\nmentioning a process of painting which is closely allied to fresco, and\r\nbears the characteristic name of _sgraffito_ (literally, a scratch).\r\nThis style of painting, or rather of drawing (for the works had the\r\nappearance of a large drawing in black crayon), was more generally used\r\nfor the exterior of buildings, and was produced by covering the wall\r\nfirst with black stucco, then with a second layer of white, and\r\nafterwards by removing with an iron instrument the second layer so as to\r\nlay bare, in places, the black ground. The most important work executed\r\nin this style is the ornamentation of the monastic house of the knights\r\nof St. Stephen, at Pisa; this work is by Vasari, to whom also has been\r\nattributed--but wrongfully--the invention of _sgraffito_, which was used\r\nlong before his time.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have chiefly confined our remarks to Italy and Italian\r\nartists; however, in the consideration of them we have nearly summed up\r\nour brief history of fresco. If we would look to France for any\r\nremarkable works of this kind, we must refer to the epochs in which\r\nItaly sent Simon Memmi to decorate the palace of the popes at Avignon,\r\nand Rosso and Primaticcio to adorn that of the kings at Fontainebleau.\r\nPrior to this, all we meet with are, at the most, a few primitive, not\r\nto say barbarous, subjects, painted here and there, in distemper, by\r\nunknown artists, on the walls of churches or monasteries. Among these\r\nconventional examples it is, however, only just to distinguish some\r\npictures of powerful effect, if not in execution, at least for the ideas\r\nthey are intended to convey; we would speak of the “Dance of Death,” or\r\n“Dance of the Dead,” like that which existed at Paris in the Cemetery of\r\nthe Innocents, and another still to be seen in the Abbey of Chaise-Dieu,\r\nin Auvergne; legends more than\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 244.--“Fraternity of the Cross-bowmen.”\r\n(Fresco-Painting of the Fifteenth Century, in the ancient Chapel of St.\r\nJohn and St. Paul, Ghent.)]\r\n\r\npictures, and philosophical compositions rather than manifestations of\r\nart. Spain, too, has no reason to be proud of her national productions;\r\nfor, with the exception of the Gothic frescoes still existing in the\r\nCathedral of Toledo, representing the combats between the Moors and the\r\nToledans (pictures specially worthy of the attention of archæologists),\r\nthe only frescoes of Spanish origin we can mention are the paintings of\r\na few ceilings in the Escurial and in a chapter-room in the Cathedral of\r\nToledo; all the other frescoes must be attributed to Italian artists.\r\n\r\nWhenever the northern artists, usually so cold and methodical in their\r\nmode of operation, devoted themselves to mural painting, it seems to\r\nhave been necessary that they should enliven their temperament in the\r\nsunny rays of a southern sky; for while in Holland and Belgium we notice\r\nbut few walls covered with decorative painting, we find a large number\r\nof Italian churches and palaces which contain frescoes bearing the\r\nsignature of Flemish masters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 245.--“Death and the Jew.” An episode from the\r\n“Dance of Death.” Painted in 1441, in the Cemetery of the Dominicans,\r\nBasle. (Facsimile from the Engraving of M. Mérian.)]\r\n\r\nThere was considerable excitement manifested a few years ago at the\r\ndiscovery of the mural paintings in the ancient Chapel of St. John and\r\nSt. Paul, in Ghent (Fig. 244). These works are of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and although satisfactory enough as regards the design, they\r\nderive more importance from the subjects which they represent than from\r\nany merit of execution.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of Germany, we should not omit to mention the ancient “Dance\r\nof Death” (Fig. 245), at Basle, in the cemetery of the Dominicans,\r\npainted in the middle of the fifteenth century; also another “Dance of\r\nDeath” much more famous, and the façades of several houses, painted at\r\nBasle by Holbein. We must also indicate the paintings with which (in\r\n1466) Israel de Meckenheim covered the walls of a chapel of St. Mary of\r\nthe Capitol, at Cologne; and the frescoes of St. Etienne and St.\r\nAugustine, at Vienna. But it does not follow, from this limited\r\nenumeration of works, that Germany either created or followed any\r\nspecial school.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 246.--Fra Angelico, of Fiesole.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTING ON WOOD, CANVAS, ETC.\r\n\r\n     The Rise of Christian Painting.--The Byzantine School.--First\r\n     Revival in Italy.--Cimabue, Giotto, Fra Angelico.--Florentine\r\n     School: Leonardo da Vinci, Michael Angelo.--Roman School: Perugino,\r\n     Raphael.--Venetian School: Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese.--Lombard\r\n     School: Correggio, Parmigianino.--Spanish School.--German and\r\n     Flemish Schools: Stephan of Cologne, John of Bruges, Lucas van\r\n     Leyden, Albert Dürer, Lucas van Cranach, Holbein.--Painting in\r\n     France during the Middle Ages.--Italian Masters in France.--Jean\r\n     Cousin.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter its first weak manifestations in the dark shadows of the\r\nCatacombs--the place of refuge to which the earliest believers had to\r\nresort to celebrate their holy mysteries--Christian painting made its\r\nfirst attempt to display itself in open day at the time when the new\r\nfaith found in Constantine the high protection of a crowned disciple.\r\nBut this art felt an instinctive repugnance to draw its inspirations\r\nfrom works which had been created under the empire of decayed and\r\ncontemned creeds. In the completely spiritual worship of the true God,\r\nit seemed but natural to seek for other types than those which had been\r\nconsecrated by the fancies of materialistic mythologies.\r\n\r\nThe school of _idea_, which was substituted for the school of _form_,\r\ndesired to owe nothing to its frivolous predecessor. It would have\r\nconsidered it a reproach to give even the semblance of permanence to\r\nreprobated traditions, and it set itself to work to create an art\r\ncompletely new in all its features. The rule it laid down, therefore,\r\nwas to regard as non-existent the _chefs-d’œuvre_ which recalled to mind\r\nthe days of moral error; rejecting the inspiration to be derived from\r\nthe magnificent relics of the past, it resolved to commence an era of\r\nits own, and to exist on its own ideas. Hence that principle of\r\nenergetic simplicity which, although it may have hindered art from\r\nelevating itself to the perfection we call classical, had at least this\r\nadvantage, that it sought by gradual development to imprint on\r\nChristian art a stamp of individuality from which it was to derive both\r\nits power and its glory.\r\n\r\nThus, by the enthusiasm of faith, was called into existence that really\r\nprimitive School of Painting which has received the name of _Byzantine_;\r\nbecause at the very time when it obtained the liberty of displaying\r\nitself, Constantine, transferring the seat of empire to Byzantium,\r\nnecessarily took with him the body of artists of whom he was the\r\nprotector; because, too, as we have before observed, Byzantium\r\nhenceforth became for many centuries the sole focus whence light\r\nradiated towards the West, which was now plunged in barbarism. We must,\r\ntherefore, go back to the Byzantine school, if we wish to trace to their\r\norigin all the forms of European painting.\r\n\r\n“Allegory,” says M. Michiels, “was the first language of Christian\r\npainting; not only did it express typically the Evangelical teachings,\r\nbut the Divine personages themselves were metamorphosed into symbols.\r\nSometimes, for instance, Christ appeared in the form of a young\r\nshepherd, bearing on his shoulders and carrying back to the fold a\r\nwandering sheep; sometimes He was represented as the Orpheus of the new\r\nfaith, charming and taming ferocious animals by the sound of His\r\nlute.... He also was made to assume the form of the lamb without spot,\r\nor of a phœnix spreading its wings, the conqueror of death and the\r\nspirits of darkness. Thus was the transition softened down; thus did\r\nthey escape the raillery of Pagans who would have turned into ridicule\r\nthe heroic sufferings and the glorious humiliations of the Son of man.\r\nBut this timidity could not long continue.... The council held at\r\nConstantinople in 692 commanded that allegory should be repudiated, and\r\nthat the objects of their veneration should be displayed to the faithful\r\nwithout the veil hitherto employed. Now was exhibited to view a\r\nspectacle new indeed to men; a Deity crowned with thorns, enduring the\r\noutrages of a vile populace, or stretched upon a cross and pierced with\r\na lance, turning His sad glance to heaven and wrestling with His agony.\r\nThe Greeks and Latins were but slow in adopting this mode of\r\nrepresentation, and did so with regret.... But the perception of moral\r\ndignity was destined to eclipse the vain pomp of Pagan grandeur. The\r\ngenerous sufferings of sacrifice were to become the greatest of all\r\nglories.”\r\n\r\n“Christian painting, when once established as an art on the banks of the\r\nBosphorus, assumed a certain immobility of character. Forms, attitudes,\r\ngroups, and vestments--all were regulated by ecclesiastical\r\nprescription. There was, as it were, an inflexible text-book, to which\r\nartists were bound to submit. Delicacy of colouring and nobility of\r\nattitude were the only things to recall the beauty of ancient art. Even\r\nin our days the Greek and Russian painters follow a similar plan,\r\ndrawing and arranging their figures in the same manner as their\r\nancestors of the time of Honorius and the Palæologi.”\r\n\r\nEven in the West the case was nearly the same, so long as the practice\r\nof painting remained almost exclusively confined to artists coming from\r\nConstantinople. Thus, in some celebrated manuscripts of the eighth and\r\nninth centuries we find compositions that give a very exact\r\nrepresentation of the state of the art in these remote times, though the\r\npaintings themselves have been destroyed by the Iconoclasts. In fact,\r\nduring ten centuries it seemed that the Western races resisted any\r\nexpression of artistic individuality or invention. Throughout this long\r\nperiod we find Greek painters the supreme arbiters of taste and\r\nknowledge in the countries of Western Europe, forcing upon them their\r\nown barren style, and teaching them their contracted perceptions. Art\r\namong them seemed always to be but a mere instinct. Constant\r\nimmigrations took place which were continually leading them to every\r\npoint in Western Europe, but none of them ever brought anything novel in\r\nart beyond what their predecessors had already introduced. If they took\r\nroot in a new country, the son repeated the works of his father. The\r\npupil took no means to enlarge his thoughts; he adopted as his model and\r\nhis ideal nothing but the work of his master, and the poor form of\r\ntradition was continued without enthusiasm and without progress (Fig.\r\n247). Genius is altogether wanting, or if its sacred spark sprung forth\r\nfrom heaven, it was soon extinguished when it reached the earth for want\r\nof a soul which could receive it, and be kindled by its fire. The Greek\r\nmasters doubtless affected some pride in the grandeur of their native\r\nname, but they were none the less living proofs that the sources from\r\nwhich flowed the inspiration of a Zeuxis, a Protogenes, or an Apelles,\r\nhad since those far-distant days been long dried up. The East had for\r\never terminated its ancient character of artistic creation, and the most\r\nit seemed destined to achieve during the Middle Ages was to preserve the\r\ngerm which the West was to bring again into active life.\r\n\r\nItaly, and more particularly Tuscany, may lay claim to the honour of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 247.--“Baptism of King Clovis.” (Fragment of a\r\nPainting on Canvas at Rheims. Fifteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nhaving witnessed, about the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of\r\nthe fourteenth century, the dawn of the great revival of artistic light.\r\nThe names of Giunta of Pisa, Guido of Siena, and Duccio, had, however,\r\nalready commenced the glorious list of Italian artists, who were the\r\nfirst to endeavour to modify the immutable Greek manner. Their attempts,\r\nno doubt, seem but insignificant, looking at the immense progress\r\nsubsequently accomplished; but, however slight it may appear to be, the\r\nfirst step made beyond the beaten path which has been trodden for\r\ncenturies is often evidence of the most courageous daring.\r\n\r\nThe year 1240 witnessed the birth of Cimabue: as a young man, he became\r\nenamoured of art by watching the labours of the Greek painters who had\r\nbeen summoned to Florence to decorate the chapel of the Gondi. It was\r\npurposed to make him a _savant_ and a lawyer; but he succeeded in\r\nabandoning the pen in favour of the pencil, and, from the lessons of the\r\ntimid Byzantines, he soon became a master whose every thought was\r\nhenceforth devoted to the emancipation of an art that he found condemned\r\nto a kind of immobility. Thanks to him, the expression of faces, which\r\nup to that time had been entirely conventional in character, was\r\nanimated by a truer sentiment; the lines of drawing, which had been hard\r\nand stiff, were broken up into well-ordered grace; the colouring,\r\nhitherto dull and gloomy, assumed soft brilliancy and harmonious relief.\r\nIt is said that Cimabue’s _chef-d’œuvre_, the “Madonna” which is still\r\nto be seen in the Church of Santa-Maria-Novella, was carried in\r\nprocession by the crowd to the place which it now occupies; the painter\r\nwas received with shouts, and, it is added, the joy of the people at the\r\nsight of the picture was so great that the part of the city wherein\r\nCimabue’s studio was situated received, after this event, the name of\r\n_Borgo Allegro_ (the Joyous Town). One day when Cimabue was in the\r\ncountry, he noticed a young shepherd-boy who was amusing himself by\r\nsketching on a rock the sheep he tended. The painter took charge of the\r\nboy; he became his favourite pupil, and was the celebrated Giotto, who\r\nhappily persevered in the reform commenced by Cimabue. Giotto, the first\r\namong the artists of his time, ventured to paint portraits, and\r\nsucceeded well in them. To him we owe our acquaintance with the real\r\nfeatures of his friend Dante; and we still admire, at least as\r\nmanifestations of an adventurous genius, the paintings he left in the\r\nChurch of Santa Clara at Naples, in the Cathedral of Assisi, and\r\nespecially in the Campo Santo at Pisa, where he painted in fresco the\r\nhistory of Job.\r\n\r\nGiotto died in 1336, but he left behind him to continue his work, Taddeo\r\nGaddi, Giottino, Stefano, Andrea Orcagna, and Simon Memmi, who were\r\neach destined to open out some new path in art. In the Campo Santo at\r\nPisa we may see how great was the power of the genius of these masters,\r\nespecially of Andrea Orcagna (1329-1389), who has there represented,\r\nwith an equal measure of beauty and of sombre and terrible energy, the\r\n“Dream of Life,” facing the “Triumph of Death.” Taddeo Gaddi remained a\r\nfervent disciple of his master, and continued his delicate accuracy of\r\ndesign, and the living freshness of his colouring. Stefano succeeded him\r\nin the boldness of his compositions, in his studious knowledge of the\r\nnude, and of perspective effect which had been hitherto neglected.\r\nGiottino inherited his serious inspirations. Memmi endeavoured to recall\r\nhis mystical and graceful sentiment. Orcagna, who was at once painter,\r\nsculptor, architect, and poet, seemed to possess in turn all the\r\nqualities which his fellow-disciples had shared among them, and could\r\nrepresent with equal success the terrors of the infernal regions and the\r\nvisions of heaven.\r\n\r\nThe progress of which these painters had constituted themselves the\r\napostles was not carried out without exciting some opposition. In\r\naddition to the Greek masters, who naturally felt compelled to contend\r\nwith the innovators, certain individuals were found among the Italian\r\nartists who energetically embraced the party of the past. We will only\r\nmention one, Margaritone of Arezzo, who wore out his long life in a\r\nuseless devotion to a cause which was already lost; even his name we\r\nshould not have particularised, if it had not been that the art owed him\r\nsome gratitude for the service he rendered it, by substituting the use\r\nof canvas prepared for painting instead of panels of wood, which had\r\nhitherto been exclusively employed.\r\n\r\nThe Florentine school (for thus we call the group of artists who trod in\r\nthe footsteps of Cimabue and Giotto) had for its representative, at the\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century, Giovanni of Fiesole, surnamed _Fra\r\nAngelico_, the personification of enthusiasm in artistic sublimity;\r\nwhose works, too, resemble so many hymns of adoration. Born in the year\r\n1387, and inheriting great wealth, he was endowed with a contemplative\r\nmind, and, ignorant of the talent which inspired him, he sought oblivion\r\nfrom the world in the garb of a Dominican, little suspecting that glory\r\nawaited him in the very depth of his humility. At first, as a kind of\r\npious recreation, he covered with miniatures several pages of\r\nmanuscripts; next, his companions in the cloister requested him to\r\npaint a picture. He obeyed, feeling convinced that the inspiration which\r\nstirred within him was a manifestation of the Divine spirit, and it was\r\nwith the most artless simplicity that he referred to this celestial\r\norigin the _chef-d’œuvre_ which proceeded from his hands. His reputation\r\nspread far and wide. At the invitation of the head of the Christian\r\nChurch, he repaired to Rome in order to paint one of the chapels of the\r\nVatican. And when the pontiff, full of enthusiasm at his talent, wished\r\nto confer upon him as a reward the dignity of archbishop, Angelico\r\nretired modestly to his cell in order to devote himself without\r\ninterruption to that art which was to him a continual prayer, and a\r\nperpetual soaring up to that heavenly country on which he unceasingly\r\nmeditated with all the unutterable feelings of the elect.\r\n\r\nAbout the same era as the “seraphic monk,” who died full of years in\r\n1455, appeared Tomaso Guidi, for whom a kind of unconsciousness of\r\neveryday life had obtained the ironical _sobriquet_ of Masaccio (the\r\nStupid); who, however, astonished the world by his works to such extent\r\nthat it was said concerning them, “those of his predecessors were\r\n_painted_, but his were _living_.” Masaccio was one of the first (and\r\nthis fact shows how slowly art may progress even in bold hands) to place\r\nin his pictures firmly on the soles of their feet figures presenting a\r\nfull front, instead of making them stand upon their great-toes, as his\r\npredecessors had done from a want of knowledge of the requisite\r\nforeshortening. Masaccio died in 1443.\r\n\r\nPhilippo Lippi, who devoted himself more specially to the study of\r\nnature, both in the human physiognomy and also in the accessory details\r\nof his works, marks as it were the last stage of the art, when it\r\napproached the state of full vigour in which it was to manifest the\r\nwhole extent of its power. We are now at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and the masters of the _great masters_ are in existence. It was\r\nAndrea Verrochio who, at the sight of an angel which Leonardo da Vinci,\r\nhis pupil, had painted in one of his works, for ever abandoned his\r\npencil. It was Domenico Ghirlandajo who, jealous of the superior\r\nqualities which he recognised in his pupil, the youthful Buonarotti, not\r\nonly endeavoured, but succeeded in diverting his talents, at least for a\r\ntime, to sculpture. It was Fra Bartolommeo (1469-1517) who was affected\r\nwith such profound grief at the death of his friend Savonarola, that he\r\nembraced a monastic life. Baccio della Porta (such was the name of the\r\nBrother) was a very great painter (Fig. 248); the vigour and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 248.--“The Patriarch Job.” A Painting on Panel, by\r\nFra Bartolommeo. Fifteenth Century.\r\n\r\n(In the Gallery at Florence.)]\r\n\r\nharmony of colouring which he showed, especially in his last\r\nproductions, has sometimes caused them to be attributed to Raphael, with\r\nwhom he was for some time united in the bonds of friendship. But we must\r\nnot confine ourselves to characterising the works of one single group of\r\nartists; for, although the revival took its rise on the banks of the\r\nArno, it spread far and wide beyond those limits. Added to this, Giotto,\r\nwhen visiting Verona, Padua, and Rome, left in each place the still\r\nresplendent traces of his presence. When Fra Angelico went to adorn the\r\nVatican, his genius spread around it a fruitful irradiation which\r\neverywhere dimmed the ancient renown of the Byzantine painters who had\r\nhitherto prevailed in the Italian cities.\r\n\r\nAt Rome we find flourishing in succession Pietro Cavallini, whom Giotto\r\nhad instructed during the sojourn of the latter in the Eternal City;\r\nGentile da Fabriano, who drew his inspiration from Fra Angelico; and\r\nPietro della Francesca, who has been regarded as the originator of\r\nperspective. We next meet with Pietro Vannucci, called Perugino, who was\r\nborn in 1446; it was owing to nothing but the force of his genius and\r\nhis character that he became one of the most celebrated masters of his\r\ntime. At the close of his career, Perugino had the honour of initiating\r\ninto the practice of his art Raphael Sanzio of Urbino, who was in his\r\nown day, as he still is, the prince of painting.\r\n\r\nAt Venice a body of pioneers, still more numerous and compact, prepared\r\nthe way for the new era, destined to be made illustrious by Titian,\r\nTintoretto, and Paul Veronese. We will mention also Gentile and Jacopo\r\nBellini; the former was incessantly absorbed in investigating the\r\ntheories of an art which he nevertheless exercised with all the\r\n_abandon_ of an inspired genius; the latter constantly devoted himself\r\nto the combination of power and grace; and, at the age of seventy-five\r\nyears, seemed to regain a second youth in following with happy boldness\r\nthe example of his pupil Giorgione.[35] This painter, who was born in\r\n1477, and died in 1511, introduced all kinds of innovations in respect\r\nto design and colouring, and was the master of Giovanni da Udine,\r\nSebastian del Piombo, Jacques Palma, and Pordenone, fellow-pupils and\r\nsometimes rivals of the three great artists by whose works the Venetian\r\nschool was to mark its individuality.\r\n\r\nAt Parma a local school was represented by Antonio Allegri, called\r\nCorreggio, born in 1494; and by Francesco Mazzuoli, called Parmigianino,\r\nborn in 1503.\r\n\r\nIn other places, too, talents of a vigorous or of a graceful character\r\nwere developed, but we can only cast a comprehensive glance on this\r\nmemorable artistic epoch, and are unable to offer a detailed review of\r\nthe artists and their works. And what further luminaries of art could we\r\nwish to embrace in our summary after having displayed in it, shining, so\r\nto speak, at one and the same epoch, Leonardo da Vinci (Fig. 249),\r\nMichael Angelo, Raphael, Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese, Correggio, and\r\nParmigianino?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 249.--Portrait of Leonardo da Vinci, from a Venetian\r\nEngraving of the Sixteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nFour principal schools compete with one another--the Florentine school,\r\nthe characteristics of which are truth of design, energy of colouring,\r\nand grandeur of conception; the Roman school, which seeks its ideal in\r\nthe skilful and sober judgment of its lines, the dignity of its\r\ncompositions, propriety of expression and beauty of form; the Venetian\r\nschool, which occasionally neglected correctness of drawing, and devoted\r\nitself more to the brilliancy and magical effect of colour; lastly, the\r\nschool of Parma, which is distinguished especially by its softness of\r\ntouch and by its knowledge of light and shade. All such estimations of\r\nthe different qualities of these various groups must not, however, be\r\nlooked upon as in any way absolute.\r\n\r\nAs chiefs of the first school we have two men, each of whom presents to\r\nus one of the richest organisations and the most widely extending genius\r\nwhich human nature has, perhaps, ever produced; these were Leonardo da\r\nVinci and Michael Angelo, both of whom were sculptors as well as\r\npainters; and also architects, musicians, and poets. We will first speak\r\nof Leonardo da Vinci, whose style presents two very distinct epochs; the\r\nfirst tending to vigour in the shadows, to a mistiness in reflected\r\nlights, to a general effect produced by a certain oddness, or rather by\r\na strange representation of truth; a combination of qualities which, as\r\nM. Michiels says, makes Leonardo the “most northerly of the Italian\r\npainters” (Fig. 250). His second style, “clear, serene, and precise,”\r\ntransports us into a “completely southern sphere.” But some secret\r\ninfluence drew the artist so forcibly towards his earlier manner, that\r\nhe returned to it at an advanced age in painting the famous portrait of\r\nMona Lisa, which adorns the gallery of the Louvre. We must not forget\r\nthe fact that we have to attribute to Pope Leo X. the great revival of\r\nthe arts, and especially of painting, in Italy at the commencement of\r\nthe sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n“In Michael Angelo,” still to quote the words of M. Michiels, “science,\r\npower, grandeur, and all the more severe qualities are combined. No\r\nvulgar artifice and no affectation. The painter was imbued with a\r\nsublime ideal of majestic types from which nothing was able to divert\r\nhim. He felt as if there were existing in himself a whole population of\r\nheroes, whom, by the aid of painting and sculpture, he endeavoured to\r\nwithdraw from their mental concealment, and to embody in incarnate\r\nforms. His personages scarcely seem to belong to our race; they appear\r\nto be creatures worthy of some more spacious world, to the proportions\r\nof which their physical vigour and their moral energy would well\r\nrespond. The very women do not possess the grace of their sex; we might\r\nfancy them valiant Amazons well capable of mastering a horse or of\r\ncrushing an enemy. This great man’s object was neither to charm nor to\r\nplease; his delight rather was to astonish and to strike with admiration\r\nor terror; but it is this very excess of power which enabled him to win\r\nthe approbation of all.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 250.--The Holy Family, by Leonardo da Vinci, from\r\nthe Picture in the Museum at St. Petersburg.]\r\n\r\nNext we have Raphael, _il divino Sanzio_, as he was called by his\r\nnumerous admirers, whose genius was constantly attaining to grandeur by\r\nmeans of simplicity, and to power by means of reserve. Michael Angelo\r\nalways seems as if he were only able to represent a limited portion of\r\nhis gigantic conceptions on the wall he covered with his designs; but it\r\nwas sufficient for Raphael to place some tranquil figure on a narrow\r\nsquare of canvas, and we have before us the bright image of the most\r\nperfect and delicious inspiration. He created for himself a heaven which\r\nhe peopled with the purest and most venerated types of the human race;\r\nand a light, as from on high, beams with regal splendour on these\r\ngraceful visions. In Raphael, even more than in Leonardo da Vinci, it\r\nseemed as if two artists of equal sublimity succeeded one another. At\r\nfirst we have the charming dreamer who, in the fresh enthusiasm of his\r\nearly youth, creates Madonnas, artless daughters of the earth in whose\r\nlook and countenance a sacred light shines in all its ineffable purity;\r\nnext he is the master full of the deepest science, for whom the real\r\nbeauties of creation have no concealment; who, in representing nature,\r\nsucceeded in transforming to her the magnificent ideal of which his own\r\nsoul appears to have received the impression from association with the\r\ndivine regions.\r\n\r\n“The principal characteristic of Raphael,” still following the very just\r\nremarks of M. Michiels, “is the universality of his fame. It becomes\r\nalmost painful to hear the vulgar crowd constantly repeating a magic\r\nname, the true signification of which they do not understand.” As the\r\nspoiled child of fortune, the creator of Virgins and “The\r\nTransfiguration,” he is almost without detractors from his fame; and it\r\nis impossible to reckon the number of his admirers. “One circumstance in\r\nhis life affords us an emblem of his destiny. Having sent to Palermo the\r\nfamous canvas of the ‘Spasimo,’[36] a tempest overwhelmed the ship which\r\ncarried it; but the waves seemed to respect the _chef-d’œuvre_. After\r\nhaving drifted more than fifty leagues through the sea, the box which\r\nenclosed the precious production floated gently on shore at the port of\r\nGenoa. The picture was in no way injured. The Sicilian monks, for whom\r\nit was intended, did not fail to claim it; and since that time, thanks\r\nto the mercy of the waves, it attracts to the foot of Etna numerous\r\npilgrims to the shrine of genius.”\r\n\r\nAt Venice, we first have Titian, the painter of Charles V. and Francis\r\nI. “The genius of Titian,” says Alexander Lenoir, “is always great and\r\nnoble. No painter has ever produced flesh-colours so beautiful and\r\nlife-like. In Titian there is no apparent tone; the colouring of his\r\nflesh is so well blended, that it seems as difficult to imitate as the\r\nmodel itself. Add to his pictures their truth and expression of action,\r\nand the elegance and richness of the drapery, and we shall have some\r\nidea of the great works which he left behind him.”\r\n\r\nNext Jacques Robusti presents himself, who, from the profession of his\r\nfather was surnamed Tintoretto (the Dyer). He was at first a pupil of\r\nTitian, who, it is said, from motives of jealousy, dismissed him from\r\nhis studio; but the fervour of uninterrupted labour was all that\r\nTintoretto required in order to mature the most productive talent. “The\r\ndrawing of Michael Angelo, and the colouring of Titian”--such was the\r\nambitious motto he wrote over the door of his humble _atelier_, and we\r\nare almost justified in stating that he was enabled, by force of study\r\nand labour, to fulfil his aspirations, if we look only at some of his\r\npieces executed before a certain fever of exuberant production had\r\nseized upon and necessarily weakened his vigorous talents. To form some\r\nestimate of the extent to which Tintoretto was impelled by this impulse\r\nof creation, we may recollect that even Paul Veronese reproached him\r\nwith being unable to restrain himself--Veronese, the most indefatigable\r\nof producers!\r\n\r\nWith regard to the latter, his works are characterised not only by the\r\nnumber of figures in them, but also by the striking brilliancy of the\r\n_mise en scène_. Although he multiplies his actors, they are grouped in\r\nperfect order; although he paints a multitude, he knows how to avoid a\r\ncrowd. Notice how a feeling of life profusely pervades the whole of his\r\nvast pictures of important events; an idea of space is everywhere given;\r\neverywhere light plays a powerful part, and imagination has full scope.\r\nHe is the painter _par excellence_ of feasts and ceremonies: at once\r\npompous and natural, his copiousness is only equalled by his dazzling\r\nfacility; and we are compelled to forgive the errors with which he\r\nmingles on the same canvas the religious ideas of sacred subjects and\r\nthe profane splendour of modern times.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we say about Correggio? There is no methodical scale by which\r\nto measure grace; and there is no formula laid down of delicious\r\nsoftness. But if, at the Louvre, we examine his “Antiope asleep,” we\r\nshall not soon forget the fascinating power of the old Allegri\r\n(Correggio).\r\n\r\nFrom Correggio to Parmigianino the distance is of the kind that\r\nadmiration can easily fill up. It was said of the latter that he had\r\nmore the appearance of an angel than of a man; and the Romans of his\r\nown day used to add that the spirit of Raphael had passed into his body.\r\nIn more than one instance his genius was kindled by the sun of\r\nCorreggio, and ripened in the studios of Michael Angelo and Raphael; but\r\nin addition to this, his flexible and varied talent enabled him to find\r\na place by himself between these two masters. “St. Francis receiving the\r\nStigmata,” and “The Marriage of St. Catherine,” which he painted before\r\nhe had attained his eighteenth year, are still regarded as equal to the\r\n_chefs-d’œuvre_ signed by Allegri. It is well known that a “St.\r\nMargaret,” executed by Parmigianino fifteen years later for a church at\r\nBologna, was placed by Guido in the same rank as the “St. Cecilia” of\r\nRaphael.\r\n\r\nBy the side of, or after, these famous men, in whom the glory of Italian\r\npainting seems to have brilliantly culminated, how many noble names\r\nstill remain to be cited; how many remarkable names are there still to\r\nmention, even among those who, in following the glorious path opened out\r\nfor them by the great masters, began to show glimpses of the earliest\r\nsymptoms of decay, exhaustion, and lassitude! It does not form a part of\r\nour plan to dwell upon the various phases of this decadence; but before\r\nwe glance at the last sparks of light which were shed forth, we must not\r\nforget the fact that the Italian pleiades were not exclusively\r\nprivileged to illumine the artistic horizon.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly the case that all over Europe the Byzantine tradition\r\nhad been the sole possessor of the throne of art since the earliest\r\ncenturies of the Middle Ages. In Germany as in Italy, in France as in\r\nthe countries bounding it on the north, we find nothing but the same\r\nschool displaying the dead level of its inflexibility. At various\r\nepochs, however, certain feeble attempts at independence were here and\r\nthere manifested; but these aspirations were at first generally\r\nisolated, and therefore transient in their character. Finally, however,\r\nas if the hour of revival had been simultaneously agreed upon at all\r\npoints of the intellectual world, these desires for emancipation\r\nmanifested themselves in a corresponding effort to reject the former too\r\nabsolute form, and to substitute the element of life for the principle\r\nof conventionality.\r\n\r\nIn Spain a strange combat was waging on the soil itself, for the\r\npossession of which two hostile races, two irreconcilable faiths, were\r\nin fierce contention. The Mahometan built the Alhambra, the halls of\r\nwhich were destined to be subsequently adorned by a Christian pencil. In\r\nthe paintings that enliven the arches of this marvellous edifice an art\r\nis manifested which is both simple and grand in its character; but in\r\nthis one undertaking it appears to have exhausted the share of vitality\r\ntime had awarded to it; for immediately afterwards it seems to have died\r\naway. If, however, any fresh masters of the art of painting appeared on\r\nthe Iberian soil, they had sought in Italy the flame of inspiration, or\r\nsome mighty art-pilgrim visited their country. We must come down to a\r\nlater epoch, from the consideration of which we are now precluded, in\r\norder to meet with an Herrera, a Ribera, a Velasquez, or a Murillo, the\r\nglory of whom, although comparatively late, may perhaps hold its own by\r\nthe side of the great Italian schools, but cannot pretend to eclipse\r\nthem. Among the predecessors of these real and distinct individualities,\r\nwe will, however, mention the following:--Alonzo Berruguete, born in\r\n1480, at once painter, architect, and sculptor; he was a pupil of\r\nMichael Angelo, in whose works he often took a share; Pedro Campagna,\r\nborn in 1503, who studied under the same master--his _chef-d’œuvre_ is\r\nstill admired in the Cathedral of Seville; Luis de Vargas, born in 1502,\r\nwho was able in many points to appropriate the secrets of Sanzio, from\r\nwhom he appeared to have received lessons; Morales, whose paintings are\r\nstill admired for the harmony of their lines and the delicacy of their\r\ntouch; Vicente Juanes, whose purity of design and sober vigour of\r\ncolouring obtained for him the title (certainly by some exaggeration of\r\npraise) of the “Raphael of Valencia;” lastly, Fernandez Navarette, born\r\nin 1526, who, perhaps less hyperbolically, was surnamed the “Spanish\r\nTitian;” and Sanchez Coello, born about 1500, who, excelling in\r\nportraits, has handed down the likenesses of some celebrated personages\r\nof his time.\r\n\r\nIn Germany and the Low Countries we find similar traces of the feeling\r\nof regeneration actuating the minds of artists at a much earlier period.\r\nThe first name which presents itself to us beyond the Rhine is that\r\nmentioned in the Chronicle of Limburg, of the date of 1380. “There was\r\nthen at Cologne,” says the chronicler, “a painter named Wilhelm.\r\nAccording to the masters, he was the best in all the countries of\r\nGermany; he has painted men of every description as if they were alive.”\r\nWe have nothing left of the works of this artist except some panels\r\nwithout signature, which, in consideration of the date they bear, are\r\nattributed to him; an examination shows that, considering the epoch at\r\nwhich he lived, Wilhelm might justly be looked upon as a creative\r\ngenius. He was succeeded by his most talented pupil, _Maître_ Stephan. A\r\ntriptych of his work may be seen at the Cathedral of Cologne,\r\nrepresenting “The Adoration of the Magi,” “St. Gereon,” “St. Ursula,”\r\nand “The Annunciation.” This work, which exhibits charming finish as\r\nwell as harmonious simplicity, is sufficient evidence that its author\r\nwas possessed of much natural ability as well as a certain extent of\r\nknowledge; and if we make it our study to seek out the relics of the\r\nartistic movement of the period, we can in no way feel surprise at\r\nseeing that the influence of this early master made itself felt in a\r\nvery extended radius.\r\n\r\nBut at this epoch, that is, at the commencement of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, in a city of Flanders, a new luminary made its appearance,\r\nwhich was destined to eclipse the brilliancy of the somewhat weak German\r\ninnovation. Two brothers, Hubert and John van Eyck, together with their\r\nsister Margaret, established themselves in the “triumphant city of\r\nBruges,” as it is called by an historian; and very soon all the Flemish\r\nand Rhenish regions resounded with the name of Van Eyck, their works\r\nbeing the only representations which were admired and followed; and even\r\nin those early days it was a title of glory to form a part of their\r\nbrilliant school.\r\n\r\nJohn, the younger of the two brothers, was the one to whom renown more\r\nparticularly attached (Fig. 251). He is reputed to have been the\r\ninventor of oil-painting; but all he did was to improve the methods\r\nemployed. Nevertheless, tradition tells us that an Italian master,\r\nAntonello of Messina, made a journey to Flanders, with the object of\r\nfinding out the secret of John Bruges (by which name Van Eyck is often\r\ncalled); and that he subsequently circulated it throughout the Italian\r\nschools. Be this as it may, John of Bruges, apart from any similarity in\r\nmanner (for it was by the force of his colouring, as much as by his new\r\ntheories of composition, that he succeeded in revolutionising the old\r\nschool of painting), may be considered as the Giotto of the North; but\r\nwe must add that the effects of his attempts were much more rapidly\r\ndecisive. At one leap, so to speak, the somewhat cold painting of the\r\nGothic school decked itself with a splendour which left but little for\r\nthe future Venetian school to achieve beyond it; with one flight of\r\ngenius, stiff and methodical conceptions became imbued with suppleness\r\nand vital action. Finally, we have the first notable sign of the true\r\nfeeling of an art combining science and grace--a knowledge of anatomy\r\nis shown in the life-like flesh and under the brilliant draperies. There\r\nis, however, a considerable distance, which cannot fail to be remarked,\r\nseparating the two reformers of art whose names we have just brought\r\ntogether. One, Giotto, desired to grasp the real in order to make it\r\nconduce to the triumph of the ideal; while Van Eyck only accepted the\r\nideal because he had as yet been unable to apprehend the deepest secrets\r\nof the real. All the other masters are but as the fruit yielded by the\r\nschool of the great Florentine, and by those which the descendants of\r\nthe Flemish masters were destined to produce. At Ghent, we still have as\r\nan object of admiration, an altar-piece, a _chef-d’œuvre_ of Van Eyck;\r\nit is an immense composition, some portions of which have been removed;\r\nbut at first it did not contain less than three hundred figures,\r\nrepresenting the “Adoration of the Paschal Lamb by the Virgins of the\r\nApocalypse.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 251.--“The Holy Virgin, St. George, and St. Donat.”\r\nBy John van Eyck. (Museum at Antwerp.)]\r\n\r\nJohn van Eyck resided for some time at the court of Portugal, whither he\r\nhad been sent by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, to delineate\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “ST. CATHERINE AND ST. AGNES.”\r\n\r\nA PICTURE ATTRIBUTED TO MARGARET VAN EYCK.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the picture is seen St. Catherine of Alexandria holding\r\nin her hands the instruments of her punishment--the _wheel_, which is\r\nbroken into fragments, and the _sword_ which decapitated her; below her\r\nis the head of the Emperor Maxmilian II., who ordered her martyrdom.\r\n\r\nOn the right is St. Agnes, and a _lamb_, the emblem of her innocence and\r\ngentleness.\r\n\r\nThe _ring_ St. Agnes is presenting to St. Catherine denotes the bond\r\nwhich unites the two virgin-martyrs, and attests that both are worthy to\r\nbe spouses of Jesus Christ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. CATHERINE AND ST. AGNES.\r\n\r\nPainting attributed to Margaret Van Eyck. (M. Quedeville’s\r\nCollection.)]\r\n\r\nthe features of his _fiancée_, the Princess Elizabeth (1428). The\r\ninfluence exercised by his labours is thought to have brought about that\r\ntendency to brilliancy and realism which, after its first manifestation\r\nin the earliest Spanish manner, gave way before the encroachments of\r\nItalian genius, only to reappear in all its power in the great national\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nAmong the best pupils that Van Eyck left behind him at Bruges, we must\r\nnot omit the name of Hugo van der Goes, whose works are rare.\r\n\r\nRoger van der Weyden, of whose paintings but few are now extant, was the\r\nfavourite pupil of John of Bruges, and the master of Hemling, whose\r\nreputation was destined to equal, if not to surpass, that of the chief\r\nof his school. “Hemling,” says M. Michiels, so eminent a judge on this\r\nsubject, “whose most ancient picture bears the date 1450, possesses more\r\nsweetness and grace than the Van Eycks. His figures charm by an ideal\r\nelegance; his expression never exceeds the limits of tranquil feeling\r\nand agreeable emotion. Quite contrary to John van Eyck, he prefers the\r\nslender and rich character of the Gothic (Fig. 252) to the heaviness and\r\nscanty detail of Roman architecture. His colouring, although less\r\nvigorous, is softer; the water, the woods, the sites, the grass, and the\r\ndistances of his pictures cause a dream-like feeling.”\r\n\r\nA kind of instinctive reaction was manifested in the pupil, but the\r\nmaster was not altogether forgotten. We shall, however, find elsewhere\r\nthe effects of his direct influence; but in order not to have to return\r\nto the school of Bruges, we will first mention Jerome Bosch, who,\r\ncontrary to his countryman Hemling, sought after opposition of effects\r\nand singularities of invention; and next Erasmus, the great thinker and\r\nwriter, who was also a painter in his day;[37] lastly, Cornelius\r\nEngelbrechtsen, the master of Lucas van Leyden, born in 1494. The latter\r\nwas as famous with the pencil as with the graving tool, and introduced\r\ninto all his works a powerful and sometimes strange originality which\r\ncaused him to be looked upon as the first painter of “_genre_.” Lucas\r\nvan Leyden must close our list of the artists who opened out the paths\r\nwhich were destined to be followed, though with many a diversity of\r\nmethod and of style, by Breughel, Teniers, Van Ostade, Porbus, and\r\nSchellincks. At the head of these masters was subsequently to rise the\r\nmagnificent Rubens, and the energetic Rembrandt, the king of the\r\npalette, the great chief of the school, who\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 252.--“St. Ursula.” By Hemling.]\r\n\r\ntowers loftily over all his pupils, Gerard Dow, Ferdinand Bol, Van\r\nEckhout, Govaert Flinck, &c., as well as over his imitators and\r\ncontemporaries--Abraham Bloemaert, Gerard Honthorst, Adrian Brauwer,\r\nSeghers, &c.\r\n\r\nWhen the Van Eycks made their appearance, German art--which, under the\r\nimpulse of Stephan of Cologne, had appeared as if destined to direct the\r\nmovement--allowed itself to be led away and influenced by the Flemish\r\nschool, without, however, entirely divesting itself of the individual\r\ncharacteristics which are, to some extent, inherent in the region\r\nwherein it flourished. In Alsatia, we see the style peculiar to the\r\nschool of Bruges showing itself in Martin Schön (1460); in Suabia, it\r\nhad as its interpreter Frederick Herlen (1467); at Augsburg, it was old\r\nHolbein; at Nuremberg, it was first Michael Wohlgemuth, and after him\r\nAlbert Dürer (1471), whose vigorous individuality did not fail to\r\nreflect the temperament of the Van Eycks.\r\n\r\n“The works of Albert Dürer present a singular combination of the\r\nfantastic and the real (Fig. 253). The principal tendencies peculiar to\r\nthe character of the northern mind are always to be found in them. The\r\nthoughts of the artist are always transporting him into a world of\r\nabstraction and chimeras; but the ever-present consciousness of the\r\ndifficulties of life under the cold northern sky always draws him back\r\nto the details of existence. On the one hand, therefore, he seems to\r\nlove philosophical, and even supernatural subjects; but, on the other,\r\nthe minute details of his execution bind him down to earth. His models,\r\nhis action, his positions, the muscular development of his nude\r\nsubjects, the innumerable folds of his draperies, the expression which\r\nhe gives to joy, grief, and hatred, all seem to bear a manifest\r\ncharacter of exaggeration. Added to this, he is deficient in grace; a\r\nrudeness entirely northern in its character closes the path to any of\r\nthe softer qualities of art. The panels of Albert Dürer all seem to have\r\na touch of the antique barbarism of the Germanic hordes. He himself was\r\nin the habit of wearing his hair long, like the ancient German kings.\r\nUpon the whole, however, his beautiful colouring, the skilful firmness\r\nof his drawing, his grand characteristics, his depth of thought, the\r\npoetry, often terrible, of his composition, place him in the first rank\r\nof masters” (Michiels).\r\n\r\nWhile Albert Dürer was endeavouring to combine in his works every type\r\nof the strangest character, Lucas van Cranach made it his study\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 253.--“Jesus Crowned with Thorns,” painted on Wood\r\nby Albert Dürer; a Fac-simile traced from the original of the same size.\r\n(In the Collection of M. de Quedeville.)]\r\n\r\nto represent with no less success pleasant legends or the most charming\r\nrealities. He is the painter of artless youths, aerially veiled, and of\r\nsportive and enchanting virgins; and if some antique scene is created by\r\nhis delicate and original pencil, it seem, to be metamorphosed by a\r\nhappy facility into something that appears to have the character of a\r\nGerman reminiscence (Fig. 254).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 254.--“Princess Sibylla of Saxony,” by Lucas van\r\nCranach. (Suermondt Collection.)]\r\n\r\nBetween these two masters, so equally endowed with power in their\r\nrespective lines of art, the great Holbein takes his place, as if\r\nembodying the rather abrupt vigour of the one, and the sentimental\r\ndelicacy of the other. This painter’s artistic career was carried out\r\nalmost entirely in England, but the character of his genius belongs\r\nunquestionably to the country where he left behind him his “Dance of\r\nDeath,” a piece of tragic raillery justly held to be the most wonderful\r\namong all the creations of fancy.\r\n\r\nAlbert Dürer, who died in 1528, and Lucas van Cranach, and Holbein, who\r\ndied in 1553,[38] were destined to create a race of painters, and a host\r\nof successors were soon at work. But the movement, which was impeded by\r\ntroubles of a religious character, died away in the terrible convulsions\r\nof the Thirty Years’ War, and was never again renewed.\r\n\r\nThe era in which German art seemed all at once to decline was that\r\nwherein the Italian school flourished in full splendour, and exercised\r\nan unrivalled influence over every European country occupied by the\r\nLatin races. France yielded all the more readily to this foreign\r\ninfluence, because the Papal court at Avignon had already given an\r\nasylum to Giotto in the first place, and afterwards to Simon Memmi; both\r\nof whom, and especially the last, have left master-like traces of their\r\npresence on French soil.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, although French painting, regarded in the light of\r\na national art, cannot boast of having spontaneously produced, as a\r\nthing of home-growth, any of those essays of complete independence of\r\nwhich Germany and Italy are so proud; the memorials of French art at\r\nleast bear witness that, during the long reign of Byzantine tradition,\r\nit never ceased to struggle with some force under the yoke; at a time,\r\nindeed, when Italy and Germany themselves seemed, on the contrary, to\r\nbear the burden with the most submissive servitude.\r\n\r\nThe tenth century, in becoming subject to the influence of a foolish but\r\nheartfelt terror (the fear of the end of the world), marked a period of\r\nfatal obstruction to every kind of effort, and progress died away; but\r\nif we look beyond this we shall perceive that, from the earliest days of\r\nthe monarchy, painting was held in honour, and painters themselves\r\nafforded proofs of power, if not of genius. We shall, for instance, find\r\nthat the basilica of St. Germain-des-Prés, built by Childebert I., had\r\nits walls decorated with “elegant paintings.” We shall find Gondebaud,\r\nthe son of Clotaire, himself handling the pencil and “painting the\r\nwalls and roofs of oratories.” In the reign of Charlemagne, we discover\r\nthe texts which the bishops and priests were compelled to paint on “the\r\nwhole interior surface” of their churches, in order that the charm of\r\nthe colouring and of the compositions might aid the fervour of faith in\r\nthe congregations. But all this is but evidence recorded in the pages of\r\nthe ancient chronicles. We have other testimony derived from works still\r\nexisting, on which a judgment may be practically passed. Some frescoes\r\ndiscovered at St. Savin, in the department of Vienne, and at\r\nNohant-Vicq, in the department of Indre, which must be attributed to the\r\neleventh and twelfth centuries, attest, in all their rude simplicity,\r\nthe efforts of a thoughtful art, and specially bear the stamp of a true\r\nspirit of independence.\r\n\r\nThe Sainte-Chapelle, in Paris, by its painted windows and the mural\r\npaintings of its crypt, asserts the real vitality of an artistic\r\nfeeling, which only waited for the signal of a bolder spirit to rise to\r\nloftier things. Moreover, if other examples are wanting, there are\r\nmanuscripts, on the ornamentation of which the most skilful painters\r\nhave concentrated their powers, that would suffice to point out the\r\ntendencies and artistic standard of every succeeding age. (See the\r\narticle on MINIATURE-PAINTING.) However little we may consult history,\r\nwe scarcely ever fail to discover traces of certain groups of artists\r\nwhose names or works have survived. Thus, a series of paintings\r\npreserved in the Cathedral of Amiens, as well as the “Sacre de Louis\r\nXII.” and the “Vierge au Froment,” in the museum at Cluny, prove to us\r\nthe existence, at the end of the fifteenth century, of the school of\r\nPicardy, which possessed skill in composition, combined with a feeling\r\nfor colour and a certain knowledge of handling. Thus, too, the\r\nresearches of the learned have traced out the laborious career of the\r\nClouet family, sung by Ronsard and others, but whose works are almost\r\nentirely lost; thus, also, we find the names of Bourdichon, Perréal,\r\nFoucquet, who worked for Louis XI. and Charles VIII., and that of the\r\npeaceful King René of Provence, who thought it not beneath his dignity\r\nto make himself the practical chief of a school whose nameless\r\nproductions are still scattered over the south of France.\r\n\r\nWith the sixteenth century commenced the age of the great Italian\r\npainters. In 1515, Francis I. persuaded Leonardo da Vinci to come to\r\nFrance, and to afford the example of his wonderful genius. But the\r\nillustrious creator of “La Gioconda” (the famous portrait of Mona\r\nLisa), burthened with years and worn out with work, visited France as if\r\nonly to draw his last breath (1519). Andrea del Sarto, the graceful\r\npupil of the severe Michael Angelo, came to France in 1517; but, after\r\nhaving painted for his royal protector a few pictures, among which was\r\nthe magnificent “Charity” in the Louvre, he again repaired to the\r\nItalian soil, to which his unhappy marriage recalled him to his doom.\r\n\r\nIn 1520 Raphael died, at the age of only thirty-seven years. Giulio\r\nPippi (called _Giulio Romano_), Francis Penni (called _il Fattore_), and\r\nPerino del Vaga, whom he named as his heirs and charged with the\r\ncompletion of his unfinished works, did their best to replace the\r\nillustrious dead. For a short time it might have been thought that the\r\ninspiration of the master still remained with his pupils; but soon a\r\nseparation of this group of artists, who had found their principal power\r\nin unity of thought, took place; and, fifteen or twenty years after the\r\ntomb had closed on Raphael, the tradition of his school was nothing more\r\nthan a glorious ruin.\r\n\r\nMichael Angelo, who died in 1563, was destined to have a longer career;\r\nbut it was only to become a witness of the rapid decadence of the great\r\nmovement he had helped to call forth. After Daniele di Volterra, the\r\npainter of the “Descent from the Cross,” which is classed among the\r\nthree most beautiful works that Rome possesses; after Vasari, who\r\npossessed a double title to celebrity as a skilful painter and the\r\nhistorian of the Italian schools; after Rosso, whose renown subsequently\r\nsuffered at the court of France; and Bronzino, who sought success in\r\ntaste and delicacy; the school of the great Buonarotti produced nothing\r\nbut works which seemed to wander from exaggeration to bad taste. The\r\ndwarfs who attempted to walk in the footsteps of the giant were soon\r\nexhausted, and only succeeded in rendering themselves ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian school, the great masters of which did not become extinct\r\nbefore the end of the sixteenth century, had its period of decadence at\r\na later epoch; this will not come under our consideration. The Lombard\r\nschool, which, by the deaths of Correggio and Parmigianino, had been\r\nleft without its chiefs before the middle of this century (1534 and\r\n1540), seemed for a moment as if it would disappear as it had risen. But\r\nin Michael Angelo Caravaggio (Fig. 255) it met with a powerful master,\r\nwho was able for some time to arrest the progress of its decadence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 255.--“The Tribute Money.” Picture by Caravaggio\r\n(Sixteenth Century), in the Florence Gallery.]\r\n\r\nWe have as yet done little more than hint at the presence of Rosso, or\r\n_Maître Roux_, at the court of France. He came in 1530, at the\r\ninvitation of Francis I., to decorate the Palace of Fontainebleau. “His\r\nengraved work,” says M. Michiels, “shows him to be a feeble and\r\npretentious man, devoid both of taste and inspiration, who exhibited\r\nlaboured refinement in the place of vigour, mistaking want of proportion\r\nfor grandeur, and absence of truth for originality. Being nominated by\r\nthe king as Canon of the Sainte-Chapelle, he had as his assistants\r\nLeonard, a Fleming, the Frenchmen Michel Samson and Louis Dubreuil, and\r\nthe Italians Lucca Penni, Bartolommeo Miniati, &c. But in 1531,\r\nPrimaticcio arrived from Mantua, and a contest arose henceforth between\r\nthem.... Le Rosso having ended his days by suicide, Primaticcio remained\r\nmaster of the field. His most talented pupil decorated under his\r\ndirection the magnificent ball-room. Primaticcio painted with less\r\nexaggeration and more delicacy and elegance than Rosso; but still he\r\nformed one of that troop of awkward and affected copyists who\r\nexaggerated the errors of Caravaggio.... His empire of forty years’\r\nduration, in the midst of a foreign population, was, however, an\r\nundisturbed one. Henry II., Francis II., Charles IX., and Catherine de\r\nMedicis, showed him no less favour than Francis I. He died in 1570,\r\nloaded with honours and riches.\r\n\r\n“The number of French artists who allowed themselves to be influenced by\r\nthe Italian method was considerable. At last a man of more vigorous\r\ncharacter arose who would not permit false taste to rule him, and\r\nadopted all the improvements of modern art, without following in the\r\nfootsteps of court favourites. His talents inaugurated a new period in\r\nthe history of French painting. We are speaking of Jean Cousin, who was\r\nborn at Soucy, about 1530; he adorned with his compositions both glass\r\nand canvas, and was, in addition, a skilful sculptor. His famous picture\r\nof the “Last Judgment,” in the Louvre, suggests a high opinion of him.\r\nThe colouring is harsh and monotonous, but the drawing of the figures\r\nand the arrangement of the piece prove that he had the habit of thought\r\nand also of reckoning on his own powers and of seeking out novel\r\ndispositions, producing effects hitherto unknown.”\r\n\r\nThe beautiful composition we introduce here (Fig. 256) is taken from M.\r\nA. Firmin Didot’s “Notice sur Jean Cousin,” in which a large number of\r\nother subjects are reproduced; some of them may have been\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 256.--Composition by Jean Cousin. First Sketch of\r\nhis “Last Judgment,” from a Wood-Engraving in the Romance of “Gérard\r\nd’Euphrate.” Paris, 1549. (Cabinet of M. A. F. Didot.)]\r\n\r\nengraved by the painter himself. Like Albert Dürer and Holbein, Jean\r\nCousin did not disdain to apply his talents to the ornamentation of\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nJean Cousin is generally looked upon as the real chief of the French\r\nschool. After him, and by his side, we must place the Janets,[39] who\r\nalthough of Flemish origin, are actually French in their style and the\r\ncharacter of their pictures. The most celebrated of them, François\r\nClouet, portrayed, with a realism full of elegance and distinction, the\r\nnobles and beautiful ladies of the court of Valois.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 257.--Sketch of the Virgin of Alba. Chalk-drawing by\r\nRaphael.]\r\n\r\nWe should here close our remarks, were it not that we might be accused\r\nof an important omission in this review of the principal schools. For\r\nnothing has been said of the Bolognese school, whose origin, though not\r\nits maturity, belongs to the epoch we have made our study. But the\r\nmaterial circumstances we now mention must be our justification:\r\nalthough the school of Bologna gave signs of its existence in the\r\nthirteenth century, and under the impulse of Guido, Ventura, and Ursone,\r\nshowed itself to be industrious, active, and numerous; and also in the\r\nfourteenth century, under that of Jacopo d’Avanzo and Lippodi Dalmasio;\r\nyet it died away, reviving only at the commencement of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, again to become extinct after the death of the poetic\r\nRaibolini, called _Francia_, without having produced any of those great\r\nindividualities to whose glory alone we are compelled to devote our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, confess that this school, which suddenly retrieved its\r\nposition at a time when all other schools were in a state of complete\r\ndecadence, found three illustrious chiefs instead of one, and acquired\r\nthe singular glory of resuscitating, by a kind of potent eclecticism,\r\nthe _ensemble_ of the noblest traditions. But it was not till the latter\r\npart of the sixteenth century that Bologna witnessed the opening by the\r\nCarracci of that studio whence were destined to proceed Guido, Albano,\r\nDomenichino, Guercino, Caravaggio, Pietro of Cortona and Luca\r\nGiordano--a magnificent phalanx of men who, by their own works and the\r\nforce of their example, were to become the honour of an age into which\r\nit does not form a portion of our task to follow them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGRAVING.\r\n\r\n     Origin of Wood-Engraving.--The St. Christopher of 1423.--“The\r\n     Virgin and Child Jesus.”--The earliest Masters of\r\n     Wood-Engraving.--Bernard Milnet.--Engraving in _Camaïeu_.--Origin\r\n     of Engraving on Metal.--The “Pax” of Maso Finiguerra.--The earliest\r\n     Engravers on Metal.--Niello Work.--_Le Maître_ of 1466.--_Le\r\n     Maître_ of 1486.--Martin Schöngauer, Israel van Mecken, Wenceslaus\r\n     of Olmutz, Albert Dürer, Marc Antonio, Lucas van Leyden.--Jean\r\n     Duret and the French School.--The Dutch School.--The Masters of\r\n     Engraving.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost all authors who have devoted themselves to investigate this\r\nsubject have asserted, but doubtless very erroneously, that engraving on\r\nmetal was naturally derived from engraving on wood. Nevertheless, any\r\none who gives but a slight consideration to the difference existing\r\nbetween the two processes must be led to the belief that the two arts\r\nmust result from two distinct inventions. In wood-engraving, the\r\nimpression is, in fact, formed by the portions of the block which are in\r\nrelief; while in engraving on metal, the incised strokes give the lines\r\nof the print. Now, no one who has any knowledge of professional matters\r\ncan for a moment doubt that, in spite of the similar appearance of the\r\nproductions, there is a radical difference in the starting-points and\r\nmodes of execution of these two methods.\r\n\r\nWe certainly must consider it probable that the appearance of prints\r\nproduced by wood-engraving may have suggested the idea of seeking to\r\nobtain a similar or better result by some other process; but that a\r\nprocess should be assimilated, as if by affiliation, to another\r\ndiametrically opposed to it is a view we do not feel called upon to\r\naccept without reservation.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, certain authors look upon wood-engraving as having\r\nbeen invented in Germany at the commencement of the fifteenth century.\r\nOthers have derived it from China, where it was in use in the year 1000\r\nof our era. Others, again, propound the opinion that the art of printing\r\nstuffs by means of engraved blocks was employed in different parts of\r\nAsia, to which it had been imported from ancient Egypt, at a period long\r\nbefore it was first thought of in Europe. These hypotheses being\r\nadmitted, the whole question reduces itself into an inquiry as to the\r\nway in which the art made its entrance into Western Europe in the first\r\nhalf of the fifteenth century; this being the earliest date at which we\r\nfind engravings made in Germany, France, and the Low Countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 258.--“The Virgin and Infant Jesus.” Fac-simile of a\r\nWood-Engraving of the Fifteenth Century. (Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nThe most ancient _dated_ impression known of a cut engraved on wood is a\r\nSt. Christopher, without either mark or name of its author, bearing a\r\nLatin inscription and the date of 1423. This specimen is so roughly\r\nengraved, and in drawing is so faulty, that it is only natural to assume\r\nit must be one of the earliest attempts at wood-engraving. There is,\r\nhowever, an engraving in the Imperial Library, Paris, representing the\r\nVirgin holding the Child Jesus seated in her arms (Fig. 258), which may\r\nperhaps be considered an earlier specimen than the St. Christopher. The\r\nback of the niche is a kind of mosaic, formed of diamond-shaped\r\nquadrilaterals; the _aureolæ_ and ornaments of the niche are coloured a\r\nyellowish brown. There is, however, one singularity in this engraving\r\nwhich testifies to its great antiquity; it is printed on paper made of\r\ncotton, and is unsized, and the impression sinks so deeply into it that\r\nit may be seen nearly as well on the back of the print as on the front.\r\nWe must not omit to mention another engraving, preserved in the Royal\r\nLibrary, Brussels; this is also a “Virgin with the Child Jesus,”\r\nsurrounded by four saints (Fig. 259). It is a composition of a somewhat\r\ngrand style, and does not agree very well with the date, MCCCCXVIII.,\r\nwhich is seen at the foot of the print.\r\n\r\nWe must, doubtless, attribute to nearly the same time some specimens of\r\nplaying-cards,--these we have already mentioned when dealing specially\r\nwith this subject; and also a series of figures of the Twelve Apostles\r\nwith Latin legends, underneath which are the same number of phrases in\r\nFrench, or rather in the ancient dialect of Picardy, reproducing the\r\nwhole text of the Decalogue; one of these xylographic plates may be seen\r\nin the chapter on “PRINTING.” In these engravings each figure is\r\nstanding up, clothed in a long tunic, and covered with a wide mantle;\r\nthe ink, so to speak, is bistre, and the mantles are coloured, red and\r\ngreen alternately. The Apostles all bear the symbolical sign which\r\ndistinguishes them, and are surrounded with a long fillet, whereon is\r\ntraced in Latin the sentence of the Creed attributed to each, and one of\r\nthe ten Commandments. St. Peter, for instance, has for his motto this\r\nFrench sentence, “Gardeis Dieu le roy moult sain;” St. Andrew, “Ne\r\njurets point son nome en vain;” St. John, “Père et Mère tosjours\r\nhonoras;” St. James the Greater, “Les fiestes et dymeng, garderas,” &c.\r\n\r\nThere are other engravings belonging to the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury which make known the fact that the art of engraving was\r\npractised by several artists in France; and that without doing any\r\ninjustice\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 259.--“The Virgin and Child.” A Wood-Engraving of\r\nthe Fifteenth Century(?). (Bibl. Roy., Brussels.)]\r\n\r\nto Germany we can attribute several anonymous works to French masters.\r\nBut we must in any case claim the very characteristic works of an\r\nengraver named Bernard Milnet. In the engravings of this master there\r\nare neither lines nor cross-hatching; the ground of the print is black;\r\nthe lights are\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 260.--“St. Catherine on her Knees.” Fac-simile of an\r\nEngraving on Wood, by Bernard Milnet, called the “Master with the dotted\r\nbackgrounds.” (Bibl. Imp., Paris.)]\r\n\r\nformed by an infinite number of white dots varying in size according to\r\nthe requirement and taste of the artist. This engraver does not appear\r\nto have had any imitators; and, to tell the truth, his mode of operation\r\nmust have presented many difficulties in execution. There are only six\r\nknown specimens of his work--a “Virgin with the Child Jesus,” “St.\r\nCatherine Kneeling” (Fig. 260), the “Scourging of Christ,” a group of\r\n“St. John, St. Paul, and St. Veronica,” a “St. George,” and a “St.\r\nBernard.”\r\n\r\nAlthough engravings of this time are now extremely rare, it does not\r\nnecessarily follow that they were equally scarce at the dates when they\r\nwere executed. M. Michiels, in his “Histoire de la Peinture en Flandre,”\r\nsays that, “according to ancient custom, on feast-days the Lazarists,\r\nand others belonging to religious orders who were accustomed to nurse\r\nthe sick, carried in the streets a large wax candle ornamented with\r\nmouldings and glass-trinkets, and distributed to the children\r\nwood-engravings illuminated with brilliant colours, and representing\r\nsacred subjects. There must, therefore, have been a considerable number\r\nof these engravings.”\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century wood-engraving, improved by the pupils of\r\nAlbert Dürer, and especially by John Burgkmair (Fig. 261), was very\r\nextensively developed; and the art was then practised with a superiority\r\nof style which left far behind the timid attempts of the preceding\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe works of most of the wood-engravers of this period are anonymous;\r\nnevertheless, the names of a few of these artists have survived. But it\r\nis only by an error that, in the nomenclature of the latter, certain\r\npainters and designers, such as Albert Dürer, Lucas van Leyden, and\r\nLucas van Cranach, have long been made to figure. There are\r\nwood-engravings which do actually bear the signatures or monograms of\r\nthese masters; but the fact is, that the latter were often in the habit\r\nof drawing their designs on the wood, as is frequently the practice with\r\nartists in our own day; and the engraver (or rather the _formschneider_,\r\nform-cutter, to employ the usual expression), in reproducing the\r\ncomposition drawn with a pencil or pen, has copied also the signature\r\nwhich the designer of the subject added. An error often committed by\r\nwriters may be thus easily set right.\r\n\r\nWe must not quit the subject of wood-engraving without mentioning\r\nengraving in _camaïeu_; a process of Italian origin, in which three or\r\nfour blocks, applying in succession to the print uniform tints of more\r\nor less intense tones, ultimately produced engravings of a very\r\nremarkable effect, imitating drawings with the stump or the pencil. At\r\nthe commencement of the sixteenth century several artists distinguished\r\nthemselves in this\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 261.--The Archdukes and High Barons of Germany\r\nassisting, in State Costume, at the Coronation of the Emperor\r\nMaximilian. A fragment taken from a large collection of Engravings,\r\nentitled the “Triumph of Maximilian I.,” by J. Burgkmair. (Sixteenth\r\nCentury.)]\r\n\r\nmode of engraving, especially Ugo di Carpi, who worked at Modena about\r\nthe year 1518; Antonio Fantuzzi, a pupil of Francis Parmigianino, who\r\naccompanied and assisted Primaticcio at Fontainebleau; Gualtier, and\r\nAndrew Andreani; and lastly, Bartholomew Coriolano, of Bologna, who\r\nwould have been the last engraver in this style, were it not for Antonio\r\nM. Zanetti, a celebrated Venetian amateur, who was still nearer to us in\r\npoint of date. Two or three Germans, John Ulrich in the sixteenth, and\r\nLouis Buring[40] in the seventeenth, century, also made some engravings\r\nin _camaïeu_, but only with two blocks: one giving the design of the\r\nsubject with the outline and cross-hatching, the other introducing a\r\ncolour, usually bistre, on which all the lights were taken out, so as to\r\nleave the ground of the paper white. These specimens imitated a\r\npen-and-ink drawing on coloured paper, and finished with the brush or\r\npencil.\r\n\r\nWe must now go back to the year 1452, which is generally fixed upon as\r\nthe date of the invention of engraving on metal (Fig. 262).[41] When\r\ndiscussing the subject of “Goldsmith’s Work,” we mentioned, among the\r\npupils of the illustrious Ghiberti, Maso Finiguerra, and stated that\r\nthis artist had engraved on silver a “Pax” intended for the treasury of\r\nthe Church of St. John. Certain writers having recognised in a print now\r\nin the Imperial Library of Paris, and also in another print in the\r\nLibrary of the Arsenal, an exact impression of this engraving, were led\r\nto attribute to the celebrated Florentine goldsmith the honour of an\r\ninvention in which he might perhaps have had no share at all. Possibly\r\nthis process of printing off an impression, which was a very natural\r\nthing to do, had been actually practised by goldsmiths long before\r\nFiniguerra; they wished, doubtless, to preserve a pattern of their\r\n_niello-work_, or to see how it progressed in its various stages. The\r\nproofs, thus taken off by hand, having been lost, Finiguerra may have\r\nbeen considered the originator of a method which he only applied as a\r\nmatter of course to his goldsmith’s work. The two circumstances--that\r\nthe plate is made of silver and not of any common metal, and that it may\r\nbe classed among the numerous _nielli_, engraved plates of decorative\r\ngoldsmith’s work, which have been handed down to us and are of even\r\nearlier dates--will alone suffice, in our opinion, to dispose of the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 262.--The Prophet Isaiah, holding in his hand the\r\nsaw which was the instrument of his martyrdom. (Fac-simile from an\r\nEngraving on Copper by an unknown Italian Master of the Fifteenth\r\nCentury.)]\r\n\r\nidea that this work was expressly executed in order to furnish\r\nimpressions on paper. It was nothing but chance that in this case\r\nintroduced the name of Finiguerra, which would not have become known in\r\nthis connection, if it had not been for the preservation of two ancient\r\nimpressions of his _niello-work_; while those taken from other and\r\nperhaps older plates had been destroyed. Thus the date, or the asserted\r\ndate, of the invention of engraving on metal was fixed by the\r\nascertained date of the piece of goldsmith’s work.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the print of the “Pax,” or rather of the\r\n“Assumption,” engraved by Finiguerra, does not fail, in the opinion of\r\nall writers and amateurs, to bear the title of the earliest print from\r\nmetal; a title to which it has a perfect right, and in thus regarding it\r\nwe are induced to give a brief description of the subject represented in\r\nthe engraving. Jesus Christ, seated on a lofty throne and wearing a cap\r\nsimilar to that of the Doges, places, with both his hands, a crown on\r\nthe head of the Virgin, who, with her hands crossed upon her breast, is\r\nseated upon the same throne; St. Augustine and St. Ambrose are kneeling;\r\nin the centre, below, and on the right, several saints are standing,\r\namong whom we can distinguish St. Catherine and St. Agnes; on the left,\r\nin the rear of St. Augustine, we see St. John the Baptist and other\r\nsaints; lastly, on both sides of the throne a number of angels are\r\nblowing trumpets; and, above, are others holding a streamer, on which we\r\nread: “ASSVMPTA. EST. MARIA. IN. CELVM. AVE. EXERCITVS. ANGELORVM;”\r\n“Mary is taken up into Heaven. Hail, army of angels!”\r\n\r\nThe first of the impressions of this _niello_ found its way into the\r\nRoyal Library with the Marolles Collection, bought by Louis XIV. in\r\n1667: the other was discovered only in 1841, by M. Robert Dumesnil, who,\r\nin the Library of the Arsenal, was turning over the leaves of a volume\r\ncontaining engravings by Callot and Sebastian Le Clerc. This latter\r\nimpression, though taken on inferior paper, is nevertheless in a much\r\nbetter state of preservation than the other; but the ink is of a greyer\r\nhue, and one might readily fancy that, as M. Duchesne, the learned\r\nwriter, asserts, it was printed before the final completion of the\r\nplate.\r\n\r\nIn support of the opinion which we before indirectly expressed, that the\r\npractice of taking impressions from engraved plates of metal might well\r\nbe a kind of fortuitous result of a mere professional tradition\r\nincidental to the goldsmith’s art, we may remark that most of the\r\nengravings which have been handed down to us as belonging to the era\r\nfixed upon for the invention of engraving, are the work of Italian\r\ngoldsmith-engravers. More than four hundred specimens of this date have\r\nbeen preserved; among the artists we must mention Amerighi, Michael\r\nAngelo Bandinelli, and Philippo Brunelleschi, of Florence; Forzoni\r\nSpinelli, of Arezzo; Furnio, Gesso, Rossi, and Raibolini, of Bologna;\r\nTeucreo, of Siena; Caradosso and Arcioni, of Milan; Nicholas Rosex, of\r\nModena, of whose work we have three _nielli_ and more than sixty\r\nengravings; Antonio Pollajuolo, who engraved a print called the “Fight\r\nwith Cutlasses,” representing ten naked men fighting; lastly, the most\r\nskilful of the metal-chasing goldsmiths after Finiguerra, Peregrino of\r\nCesena, who has left his name and his mark on sixty-six _nielli_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 263.--Fac-simile of a _Niello_ executed on Ivory,\r\nfrom the original design of Stradan, representing Columbus on board his\r\nShip, during his first Voyage to the West.]\r\n\r\nMore special mention must be made of Bartholomew Baldini, better known\r\nunder the name of Baccio, to whom we owe, in addition to some large\r\nengravings both of a sacred and of a mythological character, twenty\r\nvignettes designed for the folio edition (1481) of Dante’s “Inferno;” of\r\nAndrea Mantegna, a renowned painter, who himself engraved many of his\r\nown compositions; and of John van der Straet, called _Stradan_ (Fig.\r\n263), who executed at Florence many remarkable plates.\r\n\r\nWe find in Germany an engraver who dates several of his works in the\r\nyear 1466, but on none of them has he left more than his initials, E. S.\r\nThis has not failed to tax the ingenuity of those who would establish\r\nhis individuality in some authentic way. Some have agreed to call him\r\nEdward Schön or Stern, on account of the stars he frequently introduces\r\ninto the borders of the vestments of his figures; one asserts that he\r\nwas born in Bavaria, because in a specimen of his works is the figure of\r\na woman holding a shield emblazoned with the arms of that country;\r\nanother believes him to have been a Swiss, because he twice engraved the\r\n“Pilgrimage of St. Mary of Einsiedeln,” the most celebrated in the\r\ncountry. But those amateurs who, upon the whole, think more of the work\r\nthan the workman, are content to designate him as _the Master of 1466_.\r\n\r\nThis engraver has left behind him three hundred examples, most of them\r\nof small dimensions, among which, independently of sundry very curious\r\ncompositions, we must notice two important series, namely, an _Alphabet_\r\ncomposed of grotesque figures (Fig. 264), and a pack of _Numeral Cards_,\r\nthe greater part of which are in the Imperial Library.\r\n\r\nAt almost the same epoch Holland also presents us with an anonymous\r\nengraver, who might be called _the Master of 1486_, from the date on one\r\nonly of his engravings. The works of this artist, whose manner exhibits\r\na powerful and original style, are very rare in any collections not\r\nbelonging to the country in which he worked. The Cabinet of Engravings\r\nat Amsterdam possesses seventy-six of them, while that of Vienna has but\r\ntwo, that of Berlin one only, and that of Paris six, among which we may\r\nremark “Samson sleeping on the knees of Delilah,” and “St. George,” on\r\nfoot, piercing with his sword the throat of the dragon which menaced the\r\nlife of the Queen of Lydia.\r\n\r\nWe have still three comparatively celebrated engravers to mention before\r\nreaching the epoch at which Marc Antonio Raimondi in Italy, Albert Dürer\r\nin Germany, and Lucas van Leyden in Holland, all simultaneously\r\nflourished.\r\n\r\nMartin Schöngauer, for some time designated by the name of Martin Schön,\r\nwho died at Colmar in 1488, was a good painter as well as a skilful\r\nengraver. More than one hundred and twenty specimens of his work are\r\nknown, the most important of which are--“Christ bearing his Cross,” “The\r\nBattle of the Christians” (waged against the infidels by the apostle\r\nSt. James), both very rare compositions of large size; the “Passion of\r\nJesus Christ,” the “Death of the Virgin,” and “St. Anthony tormented by\r\nDemons,” one proof of which, it is said, was coloured by Michael Angelo.\r\nWe must add (and this circumstance shows again the kind of direct\r\nrelation which we have already noted as existing between engraving and\r\ngoldsmith’s work), that Martin Schöngauer also engraved a pastoral staff\r\nand a censer, both of very beautiful workmanship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 264.--Fac-simile of the letter N from the “Grotesque\r\nAlphabet,” engraved by the “Master of 1466.”]\r\n\r\nIsrael van Mecken (or Meckenem), supposed to be a pupil of Francis van\r\nBocholt, as he worked at Bocholt previous to the year 1500, is, of all\r\nGerman engravers of this epoch, the one whose works are most extensively\r\nknown. The Cabinet of Engravings in the Imperial Library, Paris,\r\npossesses three volumes of his engravings, containing two hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight superb examples; among these we must especially notice a\r\ncomposition engraved on two plates of the same height; “St. Gregory\r\nperceiving the Man of Sorrows at the Moment of the Mass.” We must\r\nconfine ourselves to the mention, in addition, of his “St. Luke painting\r\nthe Portrait of the Virgin;” “St. Odile releasing from Purgatory, by his\r\nprayers, the Soul of his Father, Duke Etichon;” “Herodias” (Fig. 265);\r\nand “Lucretia killing herself in the presence of Collatinus and others,”\r\nwhich last is the only subject this artist has taken from profane\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nWe mention Wenceslaus of Olmutz, who was engaged in engraving from the\r\nyear 1481 to 1497, with the especial object of describing an allegorical\r\nprint due to his _burin_; it may serve to give a notion of the fantastic\r\ntendency impressed on the ideas of the day by the religious dissensions\r\nwhich arose at this epoch between several princes of Germany and the\r\ncourt of Rome. This print, or rather this graphic satire, most of the\r\nallusions in which are now lost to us, represents the monstrous figure\r\nof a woman entirely naked, seen in profile and turning to the left, her\r\nbody covered with scales, with the head and mane of an ass; her right\r\nleg terminates in a cloven foot, and the left in a bird’s claw; her\r\nright arm is terminated by the paw of a lion, and the left by a woman’s\r\nhand. The back of this fantastic being is covered with a hairy mask, and\r\nin the place of a tail she has the neck of a chimera, with a deformed\r\nhead from which darts a serpent’s tongue. Above the engraving is\r\nwritten, “_Roma Caput Mundi_” (“Rome the head of the world”). On the\r\nleft hand is a three-storied tower, upon which a flag adorned with the\r\nkeys of St. Peter is floating. On the château is written, “_Castelagno_”\r\n(Castle of St. Angelo); in the foreground is a river, upon whose waves\r\nis traced the word “_Tevere_” (the Tiber); lower still is the word\r\n“_Ianrarii_” (January), below the date 1496: on the right, in the\r\nbackground, is a square tower, upon which is written, “_Tore Di Nona_”\r\n(Tower of the Nones); on the same side, in front, is a vase with two\r\nhandles, and in the centre of the lower part the letter W, the\r\nmonogrammatic signature of the engraver. Our interest in this plate is\r\nincreased by the date it bears; for, being engraved by means of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 265.--“Herodias,” a Copper-plate Engraving, by\r\nIsrael van Mecken.]\r\n\r\n_aquafortis_, it proves that Albert Dürer is wrongfully regarded as the\r\ninventor of this mode of engraving, more expeditious than with the\r\n_burin_, as the oldest _aquafortis_ work of Albert Dürer is dated 1515,\r\nthat is to say, nineteen years later than that of Wenceslaus of Olmutz.\r\n\r\nWe now come to three great artists who, at a period in which the art of\r\nengraving had made the most remarkable progress, availed themselves of\r\nit for producing works which eminently characterise each master\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nAlbert Dürer, born at Nuremberg in 1471, was a vigorous painter, and was\r\nnot less remarkable for the productions of his _burin_ and\r\netching-needle. We do not intend to describe all his works, though all\r\nare worthy of notice, but must content ourselves with mentioning “Adam\r\nand Eve standing by the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,” a small\r\nplate of delicate workmanship and admirable perfectness of design; the\r\n“Passion of Jesus Christ,” in a series of sixteen plates; “Christ\r\npraying in the Garden of Gethsemane,” the first work executed by this\r\nmaster by means of _aquafortis_, then a new method, which, being less\r\nsoft than the _burin_, gave rise to an idea not dispelled for some time,\r\nthat this print and several others were engraved on iron or tin; several\r\nfigures of the “Virgin with the Infant Jesus,” which are all remarkable\r\nfor expression and simplicity, and have received odd _sobriquets_ on\r\naccount of some accessory object which accompanies them (for instance,\r\nthe “Virgin with the pear, butterfly, ape,” &c.); the “Prodigal Son\r\nkeeping Swine,” a composition in which the painter himself is\r\nrepresented; “St. Hubert praying before the Cross borne by a Stag” (Fig.\r\n266), a very rare and beautiful plate; the “Chevalier and his Lady;”\r\nlastly, the “Chevalier of Death,” a _chef-d’œuvre_, dated 1515, and\r\nrepresenting Francis of Sickingen, who was destined to be the firmest\r\nsupporter of Luther’s Reformation.[42]\r\n\r\nMarc Antonio Raimondi, born at Bologna about the year 1475, was first a\r\npupil of Francis Raibolini, and afterwards of Raphael,[43] whose style\r\nhe often\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 266.--“St. Hubert praying before the Cross borne by\r\na Stag.” Engraved by Albert Dürer.]\r\n\r\nfollowed, and in his compositions did his utmost to imitate his pure and\r\nnoble manner. Everything in his designs is ideally true, and all is\r\nharmonious in the _ensemble_ of his works. Most of his engravings still\r\nexisting are very much sought after, and as any description we could\r\ngive would only convey but an imperfect idea of the excellence of these\r\nworks, the strongest testimony in favour of their merit will be to\r\nmention the high prices given for certain prints by this master at the\r\npublic sale which took place in 1844. For example:--“Adam and Eve,” a\r\nprint after Raphael, 1,010 francs (£40); “God commanding Noah to build\r\nthe Ark,” from the same master, 700 francs (£28); the “Massacre of the\r\nInnocents,” 1,200 francs (£48); “St. Paul preaching at Athens,” 2,500\r\nfrancs (£100); the “Lord’s Supper,” 2,900 francs (£116); the “Judgment\r\nof Paris,” which is regarded as the _chef-d’œuvre_ of Marc Antonio,\r\n3,350 francs (£134); three pendentives of the “Farnesina,” 1,620 francs\r\n(£64 10s.), &c. Subsequently, these enormous prices have been even\r\nexceeded.\r\n\r\nLucas van Leyden, born in 1494, and, like Albert Dürer, a clever painter\r\nas well as skilful engraver, has left about eighty plates, the most\r\nremarkable of which are “David playing the Harp before Saul;” the\r\n“Adoration of the Magi;” a large “Ecce Homo,” engraved by the artist at\r\nthe age of sixteen; a “Peasant and Peasant-woman with a Cow;” the “Monk\r\nSergius killed by Mahomet;” the “Seven Virtues;” a plate called the\r\n“Little Milkmaid,” very rare; lastly, a “Poor Family travelling,” of\r\nwhich only five proofs are known; they were bought for sixteen louis\r\nd’or by the Abbot of Marolles, when he formed his cabinet of prints,\r\nwhich became one of the richest additions to the Imperial Library.\r\n\r\nIn a befitting rank below these famous artists we may class a French\r\nengraver, Jean Duret, born at Langres in 1488, who was goldsmith to\r\nHenri II., and executed several beautiful allegorical plates on the\r\nintrigues of the king and Diana of Poitiers, as well as twenty-four\r\ncompositions taken from the Apocalypse; also Pierre Woeiriot (or\r\nVoeiriot), an engraver and goldsmith of Lorraine, born in 1531, who\r\nproduced numerous fine works down to the end of the century; the most\r\nfamous of them, designated by the name of the “Bull of Phalaris” (Fig.\r\n267), represents the tyrant of Agrigentum shutting up human victims\r\ndestined to be burnt alive in a brazen bull.\r\n\r\nThere were at work in Italy at the same epoch Augustine of Musi\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 267.--“Phalaris, Tyrant of Agrigentum, causing\r\nVictims destined to be burnt alive to be shut up in a Brazen Bull.”\r\nEngraved by P. Woeiriot. (French School of the Sixteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\n(Agustino de Musis, called the Venetian), Giacomo Caraglio, the\r\nGhisis,[44] Eneas Vico; in Germany, Altdorfer (Fig. 268), George\r\nPencz,[45] Aldegrever, Jacque Binck, Bartel and Hans Sebald Beham (Fig.\r\n269), who are designated under the collective name of the “Little\r\nMasters;” in Holland, Thierry (Dirk) van Staren.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 268.--“Repose of the Holy Family.” Engraved by A.\r\nAltdorfer.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the sixteenth century engraving reached its culminating\r\npoint, and at that time Italy and Germany no longer took the lead in\r\nthis branch of art, for the most skilful and renowned masters then\r\nbelonged to Holland and France.\r\n\r\nThose of Holland were Henry Goltzius (or Goltz), born in 1558, and his\r\npupils Matham and the Mullers, whose vigorous gravers might remind one\r\nof brilliant effects of colour without any loss of purity of design; the\r\ntwo brothers, Boetius and Scheltius Bolswaert, so called from their\r\nnative town Bolswaert, born in 1580 and 1586 respectively; Paul Pontius\r\nand Lucas Vorsterman, both born in 1590, whose engravings so well\r\nrepresent the _chiaroscuro_ and colour of Van Dyck and Jordaens.\r\n\r\nIn France was Jacques Callot, born in 1594, whose works were both\r\nnumerous and original, and enjoyed a somewhat popular celebrity; among\r\nthem the most worthy of remark are the “Temptation of St. Anthony,” the\r\n“Fair of the Madonna d’Imprunette,” “The Garden” and the “Parterre,”\r\nboth scenes in Nancy; as well as several series, such as the “Miseries\r\nof War,” &c. There were also Michael Lasne, born in 1596, who engraved a\r\nnumber of historical portraits; and Etienne (Stephen) Baudet, who\r\nreproduced eight large landscapes after Poussin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 269.--“Ferdinand I., Brother of Charles V.” Engraved\r\nby Bart. Beham in 1531.]\r\n\r\nA separate notice is reserved for Jonas Suyderoef, born at Leyden in\r\n1600, who, by combining the graver, the etching-needle, and aquafortis,\r\ngave an exceptional character to his works. Among the two hundred\r\nengravings by this master the most admired are the “Treaty of Munster,”\r\nafter Terburg; and the “Burgomasters of Amsterdam receiving the News of\r\nthe Arrival of Queen Mary of Medicis,” after De Keyser.\r\n\r\nWe are now touching closely upon, even if we have not already exceeded,\r\nthe limits to which we are prescribed by the scope of our notices; but\r\nas the history of engraving does not present, like that of so many other\r\narts, the spectacle of a grievous decadence after a period of\r\nbrilliancy, we cannot without regret come to a conclusion, when mention\r\nmight still be made of many distinguished names among the engravers of\r\nevery country.\r\n\r\nWe should also scarcely be able to pass on to another subject without\r\nhaving alluded to those men whose works belong, indeed, to the following\r\nepoch, but the date of whose birth connects them with that we are\r\nconsidering. We could not, in fact, assume to have treated of engraving\r\nhad we passed over in silence Van Dyck, Claude Lorraine, and Rembrandt\r\n(Fig. 270), those greatest of masters who were equally celebrated for\r\npainting and engraving. In truth, perhaps, we could not say anything of\r\nthem which would not be superfluous.\r\n\r\nWho is not acquainted with at least some few works by Van Dyck? This\r\ncelebrated pupil of Rubens has left in painting as many masterpieces as\r\ncanvases; and in engraving he knew how to give to his etching-needle so\r\nmuch _verve_ and spirit, that his prints are perfect models to follow,\r\nand have never been surpassed. Who is there that does not admire the\r\nlandscapes of Claude Lorraine, which are equally remarkable for the\r\nlight diffused over them, and the misty atmosphere that tempers its\r\nbrilliancy? We all know this master produced, as if for recreation,\r\ncertain engravings which for truth and melancholy (_mélancolic_) are\r\nhardly surpassed by his marvellous paintings. And how can we speak of\r\nRembrandt without seeming to be commonplace? For his fertile and varied\r\ntalent no difficulty ever seemed to exist; a theme, the most simple and\r\ncommon in appearance, becomes in his hands the basis of a masterly\r\nconception; nature, to which he seemed to lend a new life, while seizing\r\nupon its most striking realities, was for him an inexhaustible source of\r\npowerful compositions.\r\n\r\nThe mention of these artists on the threshold of an epoch into which we\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 270.--“Portrait of John Lutma, Goldsmith of\r\nGroningen.” Designed and Engraved in aquafortis by Rembrandt.]\r\n\r\nare precluded from following them, must suffice to convey some idea of\r\nthe height that art had attained during this century. We will, however,\r\nenumerate after them a few names among foreign engravers. The Flemish\r\nartists, Nicolas Berghem and Paul Potter, both great animal-painters,\r\nhave left some prints in aquafortis for the possession of which amateurs\r\ncontend; Wenceslaus Hollar, the Englishman,[46] engraved “The Queen of\r\nSheba,” after Veronese; to Cornelius Visscher, a Dutchman, we owe the\r\nfamous “Seller of Ratsbane;” and to Stefano della Bella, of Florence,\r\nthe “View from the Pont-Neuf, Paris.” Rupert, the Prince-Palatine\r\n(nephew of Charles I. of England), was the inventor of the mezzo-tinto,\r\nor black style of engraving; and William Faithorne, an Englishman,\r\nengraved several portraits after Van Dyck. France also presents to our\r\nnotice some justly celebrated names. The views of towns by Israel\r\nSilvestre, of Nancy, are very beautiful; François de Poilly, of\r\nAbbeville, reproduced several pictures by Raphael; Jean Pesne, of Rouen,\r\nhimself a painter, engraved especially after Poussin; Antoine Masson, of\r\nOrleans, has left a print of the “Pilgrims of Emmaus,” after the picture\r\nby Titian, which is regarded as a _chef-d’œuvre_. Lastly, Robert\r\nNanteuil, of Rheims, the famous portrait-painter, engraved Péréfixe,\r\nArchbishop of Paris, four times; the Archbishop of Rheims five times;\r\nColbert six times; Michel Le Tellier, Chancellor of France, ten times;\r\nLouis XIV. eleven times, and Cardinal Mazarin fourteen times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 271.--“The Holy Virgin.” Engraved by Aldegrever in\r\n1527.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCULPTURE.\r\n\r\n     Origin of Christian Sculpture.--Statues in Gold and\r\n     Silver.--Traditions of Antique Art.--Sculpture in\r\n     Ivory.--Iconoclasts.--Diptychs.--The highest Style of Sculpture\r\n     follows the Phases of Architecture.--Cathedrals and Monasteries\r\n     from the Year 1000.--Schools of Burgundy, Champagne, Normandy,\r\n     Lorraine, &c.--German, English, Spanish, and Italian\r\n     Schools.--Nicholas of Pisa and his Successors.--Position of French\r\n     Sculpture in the Thirteenth Century.--Florentine Sculpture and\r\n     Ghiberti.--French Sculptors from the Fifteenth to the Sixteenth\r\n     Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an indisputable fact that the epoch in which the Emperor\r\nConstantine, by receiving baptism, effected the triumph of Christianity,\r\ndeveloped a kind of revival in the movement of the decorative arts, the\r\nideas of which were then exclusively directed to the exaltation of the\r\nnew faith. To construct numerous basilicas, to adorn them magnificently,\r\nand by means of the chisel to embody in a material form the spiritualism\r\nof the Gospel, were the objects of this pious monarch. Gold and silver\r\nwere the less spared, as marble was considered too common a substance in\r\nwhich to represent the sacred personages of the divine hierarchy. At\r\nConstantinople, in the basilica constructed by Constantine, there was\r\nrepresented, on one side of the apse, a seated figure of our Saviour\r\nsurrounded by His twelve disciples; on the other side, Christ was\r\nrepresented also sitting on a throne and accompanied by four angels, who\r\nhad precious stones of Alabanda, inlaid, to represent their eyes. All\r\nthese figures were life-size, and made of silver _repoussé_; each one\r\nweighing from ninety to a hundred and ten pounds. In the same church, a\r\ncanopy representing the Apostles and cherubim in relief, of polished\r\nsilver, weighed more than two thousand pounds. But these splendours were\r\neven eclipsed by those of the font of porphyry in which Constantine\r\nreceived baptism from the hands of Bishop Sylvester. The part whence the\r\nwater flowed away was adorned with massive silver over an extent of five\r\nfeet, and for the purpose three thousand pounds of this precious metal\r\nwere employed. In the centre, columns of gold supported a lamp of the\r\nsame metal weighing fifty-two pounds, in which, during the feast of\r\nEaster, two hundred pounds of perfumed oil were burnt. The water was\r\npoured into the font through the image of a lamb of solid gold, weighing\r\nthirty pounds. On the right was a life-size representation of our\r\nSaviour, weighing a hundred and seventy pounds; on the left was a statue\r\nof John the Baptist of the same size; while seven hinds of silver placed\r\naround the font, and pouring water into the basin, harmonised in their\r\ndimensions and materials with the other figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 272.--Altar of Castor (a Gallo-Roman Sculpture),\r\ndiscovered in 1711 under the Choir of Notre-Dame, Paris.]\r\n\r\nWe would not assert that these works, pompously enumerated by\r\nAnastasius, the Librarian, corresponded in purity and elevation of style\r\nwith the richness of the materials employed; for we know, on the\r\ncontrary, that in order to comply with the wishes of the powerful\r\nemperor, artists were found who, by simple substitution of heads,\r\nattributes, or inscriptions, converted without any scruple a Jupiter\r\ninto God the Father, or a Venus into a Virgin. The large cities were not\r\nas yet depopulated of the innumerable crowd of statues which adorned\r\nthem; and it was only in provinces far from the metropolis that the\r\nimages of the false gods were buried under the fragments of their\r\noverthrown temples (Figs. 272 and 273).\r\n\r\nIn fact, before the art had adopted, or rather created, the system of\r\nChristian symbolism, it was absolutely necessary to borrow the elements\r\nof its existence from the glorious materials of the past, and even to\r\nimitate the works of Pagan art.\r\n\r\nIn Greece more than elsewhere--and by Greece we include\r\nConstantinople--statuary preserved, under Constantino and his earliest\r\nsuccessors, a certain degree of power which we might call original. The\r\ndesign still adhered to beautiful forms, and, in the arrangement of\r\nsubjects, the principles of the ancients were for a long time applied,\r\nas if instinctively. Although artists no longer studied nature, they\r\nwere, at all events, surrounded by excellent models, which guided them\r\nwith somewhat imperious rule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 273.--Altar of Jupiter Ceraunus (Gallo-Roman\r\nSculpture), discovered in 1711, under the Choir of Notre-Dame, Paris.]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that, among the barbaric chiefs who invaded the\r\nempire of the Cæsars and seated themselves on the Imperial throne of\r\nRome, were some who, at a certain period, professed to be, if not the\r\nprotectors of the Fine Arts, which had then sunk into torpor, at least\r\nthe preservers of the Greek and Roman monuments belonging to the noblest\r\nepoch of Art. The statues were no longer broken down; the inscriptions\r\nand bas-reliefs ceased to be mutilated; the triumphal arches (Fig. 274),\r\nthe palaces, and the theatres, were respected, or, rather, were left\r\nstanding. But a kind of deadness had come over the artistic world, and a\r\nfew sympathetic manifestations of this kind were not sufficient to\r\nreanimate its enervated spirit; it was necessary that the period of\r\nrepose should be fully accomplished--a period which, in the views of\r\nProvidence, was perhaps a phase of profound contemplation or preparatory\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, although the art which gives life to marble and bronze--a\r\nhigh style of sculpture--was in a stationary or retrograde state, the\r\nlower kind, which we may call domestic, preserved some degree of\r\nactivity. For instance, it was then the custom for great personages to\r\nsend as presents diptychs of ivory, on the outer face of which were\r\ncarved bas-reliefs recalling some memorable event. Monarchs, on their\r\naccession, were in the habit of conferring diptychs of this kind on the\r\ngovernors of provinces and bishops; and the latter, in order to testify\r\nto the good understanding existing between the civil and religious\r\nauthorities, placed the diptych on the altar. A marriage, a baptism, or\r\nany success, gave occasion for the presentation of diptychs. For two\r\ncenturies artists lived on nothing but this kind of work. It needed\r\nevents of some very extraordinary character to cause the production of\r\nany monument of real sculpture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 274.--Restoration of a Roman Triumphal Arch, with\r\nits Bas-reliefs.]\r\n\r\nIn the sixth century the cathedrals of Rome, Trèves, Metz, Lyons,\r\nRhodez, Arles, Bourges, and the abbeys of St. Médard at Soissons, St.\r\nOuen at Rouen, and St. Martin at Tours, are mentioned as remarkable; and\r\nyet the walls of these edifices were nothing but bare stone, without\r\neither ornament or sculpture. “To become living stones,” says M. J.\r\nDuseigneur, “they had to wait for another age. The whole of the\r\nornamentation was exclusively applied to the altar and the baptismal\r\nfont. The tombs even of great personages present the most primitive\r\nsimplicity.” (Fig. 275.)\r\n\r\nAncient Gaul, in spite of its disasters, still retained, in certain\r\nparts of its territory, men, or rather groups of men, in whose hearts\r\nthe cultivation of Art still remained a living principle. This was the\r\ncase in Provence, round the archbishops of Arles; in Austrasia (Metz),\r\nnear the throne of Brunehaut; in Burgundy, at the court of King Gontran.\r\nMost of the works and even the names of these artists are now lost; but\r\nhistory has recorded the movement, which was, as it were, a happy link\r\ndestined to abbreviate the solution of continuity in artistic tradition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 275.--A Stone Tomb, of one of the first Abbots of\r\nSt. Germain-des-Prés, Paris.]\r\n\r\nAt the time when Greek art, in its degenerate state, had sunk down into\r\na department of mere goldsmith’s work, casting over Europe only a pale\r\nand feeble light; when artists, in representing sacred or profane\r\nsubjects, contented themselves with simple medallions of bronze, gold,\r\nor silver, which were generally inserted in a shrine, or suspended on\r\nthe walls; across the seas Byzantine art was springing into life; an art\r\nwhich blended Hellenic reminiscences with Christian sentiment.\r\n\r\nIn the eighth century, the epoch of the uprising of the Iconoclasts\r\nagainst images of all kinds, Byzantine sculpture had acquired certain\r\nwell-marked characteristics: rigidness of outline, meagreness of form,\r\nelongation of the proportions, combined with great profuseness of\r\ncostume; all was the expression of saddened resignation and costly\r\ngrandeur. The monumental statuary of this age has, however, almost\r\nentirely disappeared, and we should be nearly destitute of any accurate\r\nrecord as to the state of Art for a period of several centuries, were it\r\nnot for numerous diptychs which, to some extent, supply this want. Many\r\nof these sacred diptychs were exquisitely wrought. Gori, in his “Trésor\r\ndes Diptyques,” written in Latin and published at Florence in 1759,\r\ndivides these monuments into four classes: diptychs intended to receive\r\nthe names of the newly baptised; those wherein were written the names of\r\nthe benefactors of the church, sovereigns, and popes; and those destined\r\nto preserve the memory of the faithful who had died in the bosom of the\r\nchurch (Fig. 276). Their outward surface generally represented some\r\nscene taken from the Evangelists, in which Christ was especially\r\ndepicted as young and beardless, his head glorified with a nimbus\r\nwithout a cross. The more these representations were condemned, the more\r\nthey who paid respect to them endeavoured to perpetuate their use. The\r\nGreek artists, being unable to find a livelihood in their own country,\r\nmade their way into Italy in such numbers that the popes Paul I., Adrian\r\nI., and Pascal I., erected monasteries to receive them. Owing to the\r\ninfluence of this immigration, Art, which in the West was germinating in\r\nan undecided state between a weak style of originality and an awkward\r\nmode of imitation, was compelled to assume a character of its own, and\r\nthis necessarily was the Byzantine character; that is, a manner which\r\nwas firm, clear, and, in general, impressed with a certain imposing\r\nnobility of style. This style attained all the more success by its being\r\nillustrated by very eminent artists, whom Charlemagne patronised as\r\nfully adequate to the magnificence of his ideas; and also because the\r\nrichness of ornament which this style combined with its work was likely\r\nto render it pleasing to the populace.\r\n\r\nThe royal palaces of Aix-la-Chapelle, Goddinga, Attiniacum, and\r\nTheodonis Villa, and the monasteries of St. Arnulph, Trèves, St. Gall,\r\nSalzbourg, and Prüm felt the salutary influence which Charlemagne\r\nexercised on all kinds of Art. Prior to 1793, in these various\r\nlocalities precious remains were still to be seen, reaching back to the\r\neighth century; they testified to the fact that, apart from Byzantine\r\ninfluence, and bearing the impress of a simple Christian sentiment,\r\nsculpture still clung, owing to Lombard ascendancy, to some of the grand\r\ntraditions of antiquity.\r\n\r\nThis union of principles gave rise to a number of works bearing a\r\nremarkable character. The foundation of the abbeys of St. Mihiel\r\n(Lorraine), Isle-Barbe (near Lyons), of Ambernay and Romans; the\r\nerection of several of the great monasteries in Alsace, Soissonnais,\r\nBrittany, Normandy, Provence, Languedoc, and Aquitaine; the construction\r\nof the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 276.--Diptychs in Carved Ivory of the Eleventh\r\nCentury. (M. Rigollot’s Collection, Amiens.)\r\n\r\n     The first compartment represents St. Remy, Bishop of Rheims,\r\n     healing a paralytic; the second, St. Remy healing a sick man by the\r\n     invocation of the sacrament on the altar; the third, St. Remy,\r\n     assisted by a holy bishop, baptising King Clovis in the presence of\r\n     Queen Clotilda, and receiving from the Holy Spirit the sacred\r\n     _ampulla_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nimportant churches of Metz, Toul, Verdun, Rheims, Autun, &c.; the\r\nrestorations which took place at the abbeys of Bèze, St. Gall, St.\r\nBenignus of Dijon, Remiremont, St. Arnulphe-lès-Metz, and Luxeuil, were\r\nof sufficient importance to occupy an immense number of artists,\r\narchitects, and sculptors, who, like the monk Gundelandus, abbot of\r\nLauresheim, handled the compasses and the mallet with as much authority\r\nas the crucifix. Nothing could equal the splendour of some of the\r\nmonasteries, which were perfect centres of genius and skill, in which\r\nall the Fine Arts united were a mutual assistance to one another;\r\ndirected, perhaps, by a master who was himself inspired by a feeling for\r\nelevated production (Fig. 277).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the smaller examples of sculpture and carving constituted\r\nthe principal work of the artists of the eighth century. In the\r\nexecution of any larger objects they were deterred by a dread of the\r\nIconoclasts, who still continued their course of destruction, neither\r\nwas it much less after the death of Charlemagne, owing to the civil wars\r\nand invasions which, in every direction, put a stop to or ruined\r\narchitectural works. A shrine or an altar might perhaps be saved, but a\r\nchurch-front or doorway could not be protected; and the hereditary\r\nhatred with which princes pursued one another did not fail to be wreaked\r\non their effigies. At that time there were neither artists nor monks;\r\nevery one became a soldier, and the common peril gave some energy to our\r\nalarmed ancestors.\r\n\r\nWhen these invasions had almost come to an end in Europe, the very\r\ndisasters they had caused assisted to some extent the progress both of\r\narchitecture and sculpture. In the first place there sprang up a\r\ncomplete order of new buildings, originated by the need that arose for\r\nfresh edifices for the purpose of public worship; the Church, having a\r\nthousand disasters to repair, built or restored a number of monasteries\r\nwhich assumed a decided character of individuality. The cathedrals of\r\nAuxerre, Clermont, Toul, the Church of St. Paul at Verdun, the abbeys of\r\nMontier-en-Der and of Gorze, of Munster, Cluny, Celles-sur-Cher, &c.,\r\nwere specially adorned with the sculptural characteristics of this\r\nepoch. Crucifixes in high relief were multiplied, the introduction of\r\nwhich into monumental sculpture did not take place before the\r\npontificate of Leo III. In the arched recesses over doorways\r\nrepresentations of the good and the bad were placed opposite to one\r\nanother; the worship of the Virgin was celebrated in all kinds of\r\nartistic productions; and, in short, sculpture was displayed everywhere\r\nwith an extraordinary amount of richness. Nothing escaped, so to speak,\r\nits luxurious growth: _ambons_,[47] seats, arches, baptismal fonts,\r\ncolumns, cornices, bell-turrets, and gargoyles--everything, in short,\r\ntestified that sculpture and stone were now in full harmony. Almost all\r\nthe figures were then represented as clothed in the Roman style, with a\r\nshort tunic, and the chlamys clasped upon the shoulder; this still\r\ncontinued to be the court-costume, and consequently the only one\r\nsuitable to the representation of the exalted followers of Christianity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 277.--Bas-relief in the Abbey-Church of St. Denis; a\r\nreproduction of the ancient Statue of Dagobert I., destroyed in the\r\nNinth Century.]\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that the monuments of this age are generally\r\nwanting both in dates and the name of the sculptor. Not more than five\r\nor six of the principal artists or directors of artistic works of the\r\nperiod are mentioned by name in any historical records. Among them,\r\nhowever, are Tutilon, a monk of Saint-Gall, who at once poet, sculptor,\r\nand painter, ornamented with his works the churches of Mayence and Metz;\r\nHugues, Abbot of Montier-en-Der; Austée, Abbot of St. Arnulph, in the\r\ndiocese of Metz; Morard, who, with the co-operation of King Robert,\r\nrebuilt, towards the end of the tenth century, the old church of St.\r\nGermain-des-Prés, at Paris; lastly, Guillaume, Abbot of St. Benignus, at\r\nDijon, who took under his direction forty monasteries, and became chief\r\nof a school of Art, as well as their head on religious matters. The\r\ndoorways of the churches of Avallon, Nantua, and Vermanton, executed at\r\nthis epoch, bear witness to the rigour of an improved taste; and it may\r\nbe well said that this abbot Guillaume, who for a long series of years\r\ndirected a number of artists, who also in their turn became chiefs of\r\nschools, exercised as powerful an influence on French art as Nicholas of\r\nPisa on Tuscan art in the following century.\r\n\r\nBut although it embraced within its influence a very extended sphere,\r\nthe school of Burgundy did not fail to find on the ancient Gallic soil\r\nvery skilful and industrious rivals. The districts of Messin, Lorraine,\r\nAlsace, Champagne, Normandy, and the Ile-de-France, in short all the\r\nvarious centres of the South, possessed numerous artists, each of whom\r\nimpressed on their works their own special character of individuality.\r\n\r\nWhile all this activity was prevailing in France, Italy had as yet taken\r\nso insignificant a part in the revival of Art, that in 976 Peter\r\nOrseolo, Doge of Venice, having formed the idea of rebuilding the\r\nbasilica of St. Mark, was compelled to summon from Constantinople both\r\narchitects and artists.\r\n\r\nA period of check to any progress took place in France, however, just as\r\nin all the rest of Europe, when, at the approach of the year 1000, the\r\nwhole population became subject to an ideal dread that the end of the\r\nworld was at hand; but when this date was once passed, every school of\r\nart set vigorously to work, and the most remarkable monuments of\r\nRomanesque architecture sprang up throughout Europe in every direction.\r\n\r\nThen it was that the artists of Burgundy built and ornamented, among\r\nother churches and monasteries, the Abbey of Cluny, the apse of which\r\nconsisted of a bold cupola, supported by six columns thirty-six feet in\r\nheight, of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 278.--Tomb of Dagobert, executed by order of St.\r\nLouis, in the Abbey-Church of St. Denis. It represents the King carried\r\naway by Demons, after his death, towards the Infernal Bark, from which\r\nhe is rescued by Angels and the Fathers of the Church. (Thirteenth\r\nCentury.)]\r\n\r\nCipolin and Pentelican marble, with captials, cornices, and friezes,\r\ncarved painted, and decorated with bronze. In Lorraine they worked at\r\nthe cathedrals of Toul and Verdun, and the abbey of St. Viton. In the\r\ndiocese of Metz Gontran and Adélard, celebrated abbots of St. Trudon,\r\ncovered Hasbaye with new buildings. “Adélard,” says a chronicler,\r\n“superintended the construction of fourteen churches, and his outlay was\r\nso great that the imperial treasury would scarcely have sufficed for\r\nit.” In Alsace, the cathedral at Strasbourg and the two churches of\r\nColmar and Schelestadt simultaneously arose, and in Switzerland the\r\nCathedral of Basle. These magnificent edifices are still standing to\r\nshow the vigour and majestic simplicity with which the art of sculpture\r\nwas then able to embody its ideas; and, by lending its aid to\r\narchitecture, to manifest, so to speak, the faith which actuated it. It\r\nwas in this century that Fulbert, Bishop of Chartres, who was doubtless\r\na sculptor also, superintended the restoration of his church, the\r\nsplendour of which is still open to the admiration of all. Art, too, did\r\nnot less distinguish herself in the decoration of certain additions made\r\nat that time to edifices already existing. The doorways of the churches\r\nof Laon, Châteaudun, and St. Ayoult of Provins, grand works of the\r\nearliest years of the twelfth century, yield the palm only to the\r\nsplendid external ornamentation of the Abbey of St. Denis, executed\r\nbetween the years 1137 and 1180. The Abbot Suger, who was himself an\r\neminent artist, does not name any of the sculptors to whose care this\r\nimportant task was committed. We are equally ignorant as to the\r\nsculptors of the statues of Dagobert and of Queen Nanthilde, his wife;\r\nand also as to the artists of a large golden crucifix, the foot of which\r\nwas enriched with bas-reliefs, and the figure of Christ, that presented,\r\nsays Suger, “an expression really divine.” The names of the sculptors of\r\nthe cathedral church of Paris are likewise concealed from our\r\nadmiration. One might suppose that a body of artists fired with the same\r\ninspiration, and with a common sentiment both in thought and action, had\r\nthere assembled to design their works; some sculpturing in marble the\r\nsarcophagus of Philip of France; some peopling the rood-loft and the\r\napse with tall figures and a long gallery of Biblical subjects; others\r\ndecorating the façade and exterior with statues, all of every\r\ndiversified character, but yet all appearing to unite in the expression\r\nof the same feelings and the same faith (Fig. 279).\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century, the Burgundian artists continued their\r\nmarvellous\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 279.--External Bas-relief of Norte-Dame, in Paris,\r\nrepresenting Citizens relieving Poor Scholars. (The work of Jean de\r\nChelles. Date 1257.)]\r\n\r\nwork. The tomb of Hugues, Abbot of Cluny; the doorway of the monastery\r\nof St. Jean, that of the Church of St. Lazare at Autun; the nave and the\r\nwest front of Semur-en-Auxois, are all of this school, and of this\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nThe school of Champagne raised to the memory of Count Henry I., in the\r\nChurch of St. Etienne, at Troyes, a tomb surrounded with forty-four\r\ncolumns of gilded bronze, surmounted by a slab of silver on which were\r\nplaced, in a recumbent position, the statues of the Count and of one of\r\nhis sons; bas-reliefs, in bronze and silver, representing the Holy\r\nFamily, the celestial court, angels, and prophets, surrounded this\r\nmonument. The tomb of Count Henry was a triumph of sculpture in metal;\r\nand, at that time, surpassed all other tombs in France, just as the\r\nCathedral of Rheims was destined, ere long, to excel all others.\r\n\r\nIn Normandy we find the same enthusiasm, the same zeal, the same skill\r\nin Art; and there, at least, we learn the names of some of the artists:\r\nOtho, the builder of the Cathedral of Séez; Garnier, of Fécamp;\r\nAnquetil, of Petit-Ville, &c. The masons and sculptors, too, formed at\r\nthis epoch a numerous and powerful corporation.\r\n\r\nIn the South, Asquilinus, Abbot of Moissac, near Cahors, ornamented with\r\nfine statues the cloister and front of his church, and affixed to the\r\nsides of the apse a Crucifixion so skilfully carved, that it was\r\nbelieved to have emanated from some divine hand (“ut non humano, sed\r\ndivino artificio facta”). In Auvergne, Provence, and Languedoc, many\r\nother important works of sculpture were executed. But the chief\r\nmasterpiece of all, which combines the different styles of the southern\r\nschools, is the famous Church of St. Trophimus of Arles, the front of\r\nwhich, where the breadth and grace of the Greek style is allied with the\r\npurest Christian simplicity, carries back the imagination to the\r\nbrightest epochs of the art.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the eleventh and the commencement of the twelfth\r\ncentury, the sculptors’ studios of the districts of Messin and Lorraine\r\nwere in full activity. Several magnificent churches having been\r\ndestroyed by fire, particularly that of Verdun, the whole population\r\nassisted, either with money or labour, in the restoration of these\r\nedifices. It was a perfect artistic crusade, in which several bishops\r\nand abbots, who were clever artists as well as spiritual chiefs, took\r\nthe lead in the movement.\r\n\r\nIn Alsace, art asserted its position in the magnificent Cathedral of\r\nStrasbourg,[48] a kind of challenge thrown out to the artists on the\r\nother side of the Rhine, who were unable, even at Cologne, to carry an\r\nedifice to such an\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLOVIS I. AND CLOTILDE HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\nStatues formerly at the Entrance of the Church of Notre Dame at Corbeil.\r\nTwelfth Century.]\r\n\r\nenormous height, or to adorn it with such a diversified multitude of\r\nstatues. Although belonging more especially to the thirteenth century,\r\nit may be taken as the starting-point of the prodigious works executed\r\nby an association of freemasons, who have marked with their hieroglyphic\r\nsignatures the stones of this edifice, as of all others executed by them\r\nin the valley of the Rhine, from Dusseldorf to the Alps.\r\n\r\nWe are, however, led to believe that Germany also did not fail to be\r\nsubject to the influence of this artistic school, for among contemporary\r\nmonuments are several in a style which manifestly testifies to the\r\neffects of the neighbouring country of Alsace.\r\n\r\nFlemish art of that time is exemplified by the Church of St. Gudule at\r\nBrussels, the style of which is especially rich with decorations\r\nborrowed from churches on the banks of the Rhine, the Moselle, the\r\nSarre, and the Upper Meuse.\r\n\r\nIf we include in one comprehensive glance French, German, and Flemish\r\nsculptural works, we shall recognise in all, notwithstanding the\r\npredominance of any particular school, one original and special type.\r\nThe characteristics of this are elongated faces with a calm,\r\ncontemplative, and penitent expression; stiffness of attitude, and a\r\nkind of ecstatic immobility, rather than any glow of animation;\r\ndraperies with small narrow folds and close-fitting, as if wetted;\r\npearled fringes or ribbons, set off with gems (Fig. 280). We see statues\r\nof lofty proportions reared up; representations of various personages\r\nare multiplied on the tombs; Greek art is disappearing and its learned\r\ntheories are giving way before Christian sentiment; thought is obtaining\r\nthe mastery over mere form; symbolism makes its appearance and becomes a\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 280.--Statue said to be of Clovis I., formerly in\r\nthe porch of St. Germain-des-Prés, Paris. (Twelfth Century.)]\r\n\r\nBut let us turn our eyes towards Italy. Venice had scarcely raised her\r\nlofty dome ere Pisa aspired to have one also. Many a Tuscan ship,\r\nlaunched upon the sea for conquests of a new kind, brought from Greece\r\nan infinity of monuments, statues, bas-reliefs, capitals, friezes, and\r\nvarious fragments; and the Tuscan people, the best organised race in\r\nEurope for fully appreciating all the beauty of form, were called upon\r\nto draw their inspiration from the relics of ancient works of Art. The\r\nenthusiasm became general. In 1016, Buschetto, regarded as the first\r\narchitect of his time, undertook the building of the Cathedral of Pisa,\r\nwhere ancient fragments are still conspicuous amid the works of more\r\nmodern creation: a kind of holographic testament the benefit of which\r\nthe followers of the art of Phidias have thus handed down to posterity.\r\nThe pupils of Buschetto, accepting the impulse of his masterly hand and\r\nreproducing his ideas, soon spread all over the peninsula, and the\r\ncathedrals of Amalfi, Pistoia, Siena, and Lucca arose, the Byzantine\r\ncharacter of which differed from the Lombard style presented by the\r\nCathedral of Milan. One might almost have fancied that the bosom of the\r\nearth brought forth statues which, as if by enchantment, peopled every\r\npedestal; and that from heaven descended the ray which animated them\r\nwith their sublime expression. The art of casting in bronze, hitherto\r\nalmost unknown in Italy, became naturalised there as much as the art of\r\ncarving in stone.\r\n\r\nWhile in the West the Arts were making such a spring, in the East they\r\nhad relapsed into the lowest stage of debasement, at the period when\r\nByzantium was simultaneously threatened by the Bulgarians and the\r\nCrusaders; although for a time they had appeared to revive, owing to the\r\nzeal of Basil the Macedonian, Constantine VIII., and some of their\r\nsuccessors. Eastern sculpture disappeared when the Latins sacked the\r\nancient capital of the first Christian emperor (1204).\r\n\r\nAt the approach of the thirteenth century, which was destined to be the\r\ngreat age of Christian architecture and sculpture, artists no longer\r\nlooked, as they had hitherto done, towards Byzantium, they depended on\r\nthemselves; and although some hesitation might still be felt, they found\r\nall round them models they could imitate, traditions they could follow,\r\nand masters to whom they could listen. Christian art had now an\r\nindependent existence, and the various schools asserted their styles in\r\na way which became every day more clear, more powerful, and more\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n“The style of the head of Christ at Amiens” (Fig. 281), says M.\r\nViollet-le-Duc, writing on this subject, “fully deserves the attention\r\nof\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 281.--“The _Beau Dieu d’Amiens_;” a Statue of Christ\r\nin the Front of the Cathedral of Amiens. (Thirteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nsculptors. This carving is treated in the same way as the Greek heads\r\ncalled Eginetic. There is the same simplicity of model, the same purity\r\nof outline, the same style of execution, at once broad and delicate. It\r\nwell represents the features of Christ as a man: a blending of sweetness\r\nwith firmness, a gravity devoid of sadness.”\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to assert any minute comparisons between different\r\nmanners and styles; even the bare enumeration of the many monuments to\r\nwhich this fervent age gave birth might prove wearisome. We call it a\r\n“fervent age,” and fully are we justified, for, at a time when a whole\r\nworld of artist-sculptors of ornaments and figures were devoting\r\nthemselves to the most delicate and marvellous works of sculpture (Fig.\r\n282), none seemed desirous of displaying his own personal distinction.\r\nWe find, for instance, numerous sculptors setting aside all claim to\r\nindividual merit, and carrying this self-denial so far that, instead of\r\ntheir own names, they inscribed that of the Virgin Mary on the carvings\r\nof the churches which they had enriched with their finest works: “Hoc\r\npanthema pia cælaverat ipsa Maria.”\r\n\r\nIn Germany, Christian art became specially enthroned in Saxony; and\r\nDresden, which has been justly styled the German Athens, can date back\r\nher architecto-sculptural adornments to the tenth century. On the banks\r\nof the Rhine, at Cologne, Coblentz, and Mayence, we find again the\r\nschool of Saint-Gall, which, having been planted in 971, under the\r\nauspices of Notker, Bishop of Laodicea, left its stamp, during a period\r\nof two centuries, in a series of remarkable works.\r\n\r\nEngland, as early as the seventh century, had called to her aid some of\r\nthe French “masters in stone” and best workmen, and she subsequently\r\ncontinued to do so for the building and ornamentation of her finest\r\nreligious edifices. William of Sens, a very skilful artist (_artifex\r\nsubtilissimus_), proceeded, in 1176, to rebuild Canterbury Cathedral.\r\nNorman and French artists also restored the abbeys of Croyland and\r\nWearmouth, and York Cathedral, already enriched with Byzantine and\r\nFrench sculpture.\r\n\r\nSpain and Portugal, the soil of which had long been the theatre of an\r\ninveterate conflict between two races embracing two irreconcilable\r\nreligions, were destined to inherit from these very struggles the\r\ncreation of a singularly characteristic style of art. In adopting the\r\nByzantine style, the Moors had deprived it of its character of simple\r\nearnestness, and made it to harmonise with the tendencies of their\r\nrefined sensualism. Even when Christian art was able to exercise an\r\nundivided rule, it could not fail to be influenced by the buildings\r\nerected by the Moors; and the fact that this alliance of architectural\r\nand sculptural styles succeeded in producing masterpieces is well\r\nattested by the cathedrals of Cuenca, Vittoria, and some portions of\r\nthose of Seville, Barcelona, and Lugo in Galicia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 282.--Statues in the South Porch of Bourges\r\nCathedral. (Twelfth Century.)]\r\n\r\nSicily and the kingdom of Naples followed the movement made in other\r\ncountries of Europe; but here, again, was felt the influence of various\r\nforeign importations. Some of them were of Greek origin, coming from\r\nByzantium; some northern, from Normandy, and perhaps also from Germany;\r\nmost, however, from Spain, and especially from the important school of\r\nAragon.\r\n\r\n“Nicolas of Pisa,” says Emeric David, “was born towards the end of the\r\ntwelfth century, in a town then peopled with Greek masters and the\r\npupils of those masters, and full of Greek monuments of every age; a\r\ntown which might be called altogether Greek. He had the good sense to\r\ndisdain the productions of his own time and to devote himself to the\r\nmore elevated contemplation of the _chefs-d’œuvre_ of ancient Greece.\r\nThis proof of undoubted discernment, and a high degree of taste on his\r\npart, could not but lead to very marked progress. But a premature study\r\nof the antique is not so sure a guide to the desired end as the\r\ncontemplation of nature, to which Guido of Siena, his contemporary, and\r\na little later Cimabue and Giotto, taught perhaps by his errors,\r\nassiduously applied themselves.” There can, however, be no doubt that\r\nthe first development of Christian sculpture in Italy must\r\nunquestionably be referred to Nicolas of Pisa. He had, nevertheless,\r\nsome rivals who were well worthy of competing with him. Among these were\r\nFuccio, sculptor of the magnificent tomb of the Queen of Cyprus, in the\r\nChurch of San Francesco at Florence; and also Marchione of Arezzo, who\r\nin 1216 carved his name over the doorway of the church of that town.\r\nGiovanni of Pisa, son of Nicolas, who sculptured many beautiful works at\r\nArezzo, Pistoia, and Florence, and even surpassed himself in the Campo\r\nSanto at Pisa, perhaps the most remarkable monument in Christian Europe,\r\nhas been placed by some far below his father in rank as a sculptor, on\r\naccount of an accusation made against him of having abandoned the Greek\r\nstyle. But this renunciation was, in fact, a real trait of genius, and\r\nactually constitutes his glory; for, by neglecting form to some extent,\r\nhe was enabled to carry religious idealism and power of expression to\r\nits very highest limits. We must, therefore, consider Giovanni and\r\nMargaritone, pupils of Nicolas; Andrea Ugolino, pupil of Giovanni;\r\nAgnolo and Agostino of Siena; and the celebrated Giotto, who was at once\r\narchitect, sculptor, and painter, as real regenerators of the art.\r\nIndeed, we might call these great artists the creators of Christian\r\nsculpture in Italy--that art in which simultaneously shone forth\r\nseriousness of composition, grace and ease of attitude, simplicity of\r\nimitation, elevation of sentiment; in short, all the great harmonies of\r\na style which seemed to breathe forth a hymn of love and faith.\r\n\r\nThanks to the studios of Agnolo and Agostino, Siena, a small town which\r\ncalls to mind the ancient Sicyone, so weak in a political point of view\r\nand yet so learned and polished, was for some time the rival of Pisa, up\r\nto the period when Florence absorbed the artistic splendour of the two\r\ncities. Florence, as the home of the Arts, became the centre of\r\nradiation, whence artists took their flight over the whole of Italy, and\r\nfrom Italy spread among all the nations of Europe.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the thirteenth century, the churches of Florence, on\r\nwhich the fraternities combined their efforts, and some of the civil\r\nbuildings of this rich and flourishing city, were filled with statues.\r\nThe foundation of the municipal palace in 1282, and that of the\r\ncathedral in 1298, made these two wonderful edifices real museums of\r\nsculpture, in which, among the works of Eastern artists, those of\r\nGiovanni of Arezzo and Giotto are distinguished. Agostino and Agnolo of\r\nPisa executed at that time some magnificent examples at Santa Maria in\r\nOrvieto, San Francisco in Bologna, and in the subterranean Church of\r\nAssisi, &c. Lastly, Andrea of Pisa, a contemporary of Giotto, as he died\r\nonly in 1345, extracted from antiquity all that Christian sculpture\r\ncould borrow from it; that is, he combined sublimity both of form and\r\nexpression. At Pisa, the chancel of Santa Maria a Ponte; at Florence,\r\nthe campanile and the high-altar of Santa Maria de’ Fiori, and a door of\r\nSan Giovanni; in the Cathedral of Pistoia, the tomb of Cino, are all of\r\nthem so many masterpieces; above which, however, the old Pisan master\r\nproudly classed the works of his son Nino. This young artist, who carved\r\nthe monument of the Scaligers at Verona, became, in fact, the worthy\r\nfollower of the school which recognised Andrea as its chief. Jacopo\r\ndella Quercia and Niccolo Aretino enriched also with magnificent works\r\nthe towns of Siena, Lucca, Bologna, Arezzo, and Milan, as well as\r\nFlorence. But when, in 1424, the tomb closed over Jacopo della Quercia,\r\nthe lofty destinies of the art seemed to come to a termination, and soon\r\nrapidly declined. In Venice, at the death of Filippo Calendario, which\r\noccurred in 1355, Italian sculpture had already lost much of its\r\nnobility and vigour of style.\r\n\r\nItalian sculpture (Fig. 283), as remarked by Emeric David, raised\r\nitself to the height of the sublime by merely striving after a simple\r\nand exact imitation of nature. It was by the same course of action that\r\nFrench sculpture always emulated its Transalpine rival; but, in order to\r\nattain the same end, the imitation followed a different path. In Italy,\r\nArt raised itself to the ideal by an attentive study of Greek forms;\r\nwhile on this side of the Alps, when sentiment required it, form was, if\r\nnot sacrificed, at least neglected. French art showed more respect for\r\nthe orthodoxy of Christian thought; she did not introduce into the\r\nsanctuary of the Holy of Holies any of those profane and material ideas\r\nthat might have been inspired by the marbles of Greece. In spite of the\r\npointed architecture which everywhere prevailed, French sculpture,\r\nreplete with a certain eloquent unction, preserved for a considerable\r\nperiod the Byzantine style in the appearance of the head and in the\r\ndelicacy of draperies; without, however, altogether renouncing its\r\nindividuality of character, and without ceasing to seek for models\r\npeculiar to its own soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 283.--Bas-relief on one of the Bronze Gates of St.\r\nPeter’s at Rome, representing the Coronation of the Emperor Sigismund by\r\nPope Eugène IV., in 1433. (Sculpture of the Fifteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 284.--Statuette of St. Avit, in the Church of\r\nNotre-Dame de Corbeil, demolished in 1820.\r\n\r\n(Eleventh Century.)]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the personal glory of the French sculptors, the\r\nhistorians of the time have scarcely taken the trouble to record their\r\nnames. In order to discover but a few of them, learned men of modern\r\ndays have been compelled to undertake laborious researches; while many,\r\nand those the most remarkable--worthy, no doubt, to be compared with the\r\ngreatest Italian artists--are and must remain ever unknown (Fig. 284).\r\nThe Italians were more fortunate; to them Vasari, their rival and\r\ncontemporary, has raised a lasting monument. In French art, the list of\r\nthe sculptors of so many masterpieces must come to a close when we have\r\nmentioned Enguerrand, who, from 1201 to 1212, commenced the Cathedral\r\nand the Church du Buc, at Rouen, and had for his successor Gautier de\r\nMeulan; Robert de Coucy, chief of the body of artists who, in 1211,\r\ncaused the Cathedral of Rheims to rise loftily from the earth; Hugues\r\nLibergier, who rebuilt the ancient basilica of St. Jovin; Robert de\r\nLuzarches, the founder, in 1220, of the Cathedral of Amiens, continued\r\nafter his death by Thomas de Cormont and his son Regnault; Jean, Abbot\r\nof St. Germain-des-Prés, who in 1212 undertook the Church of St. Cosme,\r\nParis; that of St. Julien le Pauvre being restored and adorned with\r\nsculpture at the same date, from the designs of the abbot and the\r\n“brethren” of Longpont (Fig. 285); Jean des Champs, who in 1248 worked\r\nat the ancient Cathedral of Clermont; lastly, the two Jeans de\r\nMontereau, who at one time as military architects, at another as\r\nsculptors of sacred subjects, were at the command of St. Louis, and\r\nproduced some extraordinary works both of construction and sculpture.\r\n\r\nAlsace manifested no less enthusiasm than France for the new\r\narchitectural system, and sculpture was also subject to a similar\r\ndevelopment. From Basle to Mayence, the slopes of the Vosges and the\r\nlong valley of the Rhine, became full of edifices enriched with\r\nsculpture and peopled with statues. Erwin of Steinbach (who died in\r\n1318), assisted by Sabina, his daughter, and William of Marbourg, were\r\nthe most renowned masters in these parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 285.--Bas-relief formerly over the Doorway of St.\r\nJulien le Pauvre, Paris, representing St. Julien and St. Basilissa, his\r\nwife, conveying in their boat Jesus Christ under the figure of a Leper.\r\n\r\n(Thirteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary advance that French sculpture made in this age was\r\nassisted--if not as regards the higher style of work, which could do\r\nwithout this help, at least in respect to the minor details of the\r\nart--by the institution of the fraternities of the _Conception\r\nNotre-Dame_. In many towns the sculptors of images and the painters, the\r\nmoulders, the _bahutiers_, or carvers in wood, horn, and ivory (Fig.\r\n286), were all united under the same banner. In Germany and Belgium also\r\nexisted _hanses_, or guilds, which were in direct communication with\r\nthose of Alsace, and who accepted as guides French artists of known\r\nability; as, for instance, Volbert and Gérard, architect-sculptors, who\r\nwere simultaneously engaged in the construction of the Church of the\r\nHoly Apostles, Cologne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 286.--Fragment of a small Reredos, in carved Bone\r\n(Fourteenth Century).\r\n\r\nPresented by Jean, Duc de Berry, Brother of Charles V., to the church of\r\nthe ancient Abbey of Poissy.\r\n\r\n(Museum of the Louvre.)]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the works commenced or finished in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, the only difficulty is to make a choice among these wonderful\r\nmonuments of Art; which, however, must be looked upon as the last\r\nmanifestations of Christian art, properly so-called. We must, however,\r\npoint out the polychrome sculptures of Chartres, of St. Remy, Rheims;\r\nSt. Martin, Laon; St. Yved, Braisne; St. Jean des Vignes, Soissons; of\r\nthe Chartreux, Dijon. In this ducal city we find, in 1357, Guy le Maçon,\r\na celebrated\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 287.--“Le Bon Dieu,” in the old Chapel of the\r\nCharnier des Innocents, Paris.\r\n\r\n(Fifteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nsculptor; at Bourges, about the same date, Aguillon, of Droues; at\r\nMontpellier, between 1331 and 1360, the two Alamans, John and Henry; at\r\nTroyes, Denisot and Drouin of Mantes, &c. Beyond France, Matthias of\r\nArras, in 1343, laid the foundations of the Cathedral of Prague, which\r\nwas to be continued and finished by another French artist, Pierre of\r\nBoulogne. Arrested as our attention must be by the statues and\r\nbas-reliefs which were multiplied under the porches, in the niches (Fig.\r\n287), and on all the tombs, we can cast but a very cursory glance on the\r\nimmense number of wood-carvings, figures in ivory, and movable pieces of\r\nsculpture, executed by artists who may be divided into two very\r\ndistinct classes, the Norman and the Rhenish; all of other schools\r\nappear to have been nothing but imitators of these.\r\n\r\nIn 1400 the _Maître_ Pierre Pérat, architect of three cathedrals, who\r\nwas at once both civil engineer and sculptor, and one of the greatest\r\nmasters of whom France can boast, died at Metz, where he was interred\r\nwith all the honours due to his wonderful talents. Just at the same time\r\na memorable competition was opened at Florence. The object in view was\r\nto finish the doors of the Baptistery of St. John. The formal\r\nannouncement of the competition, which was made all over Italy, did not\r\nfail to call forth the most skilful artists. Seven of these were\r\nselected, on account of their renown, to furnish designs: they consisted\r\nof three Florentines--Filippo Brunelleschi, Donatello, and the\r\ngoldsmith, Lorenzo Ghiberti; Jacopo della Quercia of Siena; Nicolo\r\nLamberti d’Arezzo; Francesco da Valdambrina; and Simone da Colle, called\r\n_de’ Bronzi_. To each of these competitors the republic granted one\r\nyear’s salary, on condition that, at the end of the period, each of them\r\nshould furnish a panel of wrought bronze of the same size as those of\r\nwhich the doors of St. John were to be composed. On the day fixed for\r\nthe examination of the works, the most celebrated artists of Italy were\r\nsummoned. Thirty-four judges were selected, and before this tribunal the\r\nseven models were exhibited, in the presence of the magistracy and the\r\npublic. After the judges had audibly discussed the respective merits of\r\nthe works, those of Ghiberti, Brunelleschi, and Donatello were\r\npreferred. But to whom of the three was the palm to be awarded? They\r\nhesitated. Then Brunelleschi and Donatello retired apart and exchanged a\r\nfew words; after which one of them, commencing to address the assembly,\r\nsaid:--“Magistrates and citizens, we declare to you that in our own\r\njudgment Ghiberti has surpassed us. Award him the preference, for our\r\ncountry will thus acquire the greater glory. It is less discredit to us\r\nto make known our opinion than to keep silence.”\r\n\r\nThese doors, at which Ghiberti worked for forty years, with the\r\nassistance of his father, his sons, and his pupils, are perhaps the\r\nfinest work we have in sculptured metal.\r\n\r\nAt the date when Lorenzo Ghiberti, Donatello, Brunelleschi, and their\r\npupils were the representatives of Florentine sculpture, the French\r\nschool also produced its masters and its works of Art. Nicholas Flamel,\r\nthe famous\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 288.--“St. Eloi, Patron of Goldsmiths and Farriers.”\r\nA Sculpture of the Fifteenth Century, in the Church of Notre-Dame\r\nd’Armançon, at Semur, Burgundy.]\r\n\r\nwriter (_écrivain_) of the parish of St. Jacques la Boucherie,\r\nornamented the churches and mortuary chapels of Paris with mystical and\r\nalchemical (_alchimiques_) sculptures, of which he was the designer if\r\nnot the actual artist. Thury executed the tombs of Charles VI. and\r\nIsabelle of Bavaria; Claux Sluter, author of the “Ruits de Moïse,” at\r\nDijon, assisted by James de la Barre, multiplied the works of monumental\r\nsculpture in Burgundy (Fig. 288). In Alsace, under the impulse of King\r\nRené, himself an artist, the sculptor’s art produced examples bearing\r\nthe impress of a remarkable individuality. In the district of Messin,\r\nHenry de Ranconval, his son Jehan, and Clausse, were distinguished. In\r\nTouraine, Michael Columb executed the tomb of Francis II., Duke of\r\nBrittany; Jehan Juste, that of the children of Charles VIII., as\r\nintroductory to the mausoleum of Louis XII., which he executed between\r\n1518 and 1530, for the basilica of St. Denis; a German, Conrad of\r\nCologne, assisted by Laurent Wrine, master of the ordnance to the king,\r\ncast in metal the effigy for the tomb of Louis XI. In Champagne appeared\r\nJean de Vitry, sculptor of the stalls of the Church of St. Claude\r\n(Jura); in Berry, Jacquet Gendre, _master-mason_ and _figure-maker_ for\r\nthe Hôtel de Ville, Bourges, &c.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the same century, Peter Brucy, of Brussels, exercised his\r\nart at Toulouse; the inspiration of the Alsacian artists was developed\r\nin the magnificent sculpture of Thann, Kaisersberg, and Dusenbach; while\r\nGermany, achieving but a late independence, sheltered the faults of her\r\nearly genius under the illustrious names of Lucas Moser, Peter Vischer,\r\nSchühlein, Michel Wohlgemuth, Albert Dürer (Fig. 289), &c.\r\n\r\nIn sculptural works, as in every other branch of art, historical\r\nsentiment and faith seemed to die out with the fifteenth century.\r\nMediæval art was subjected to protest; the desire seemed to be to\r\nre-create beauty of form by going back to the antique; but the\r\nemphatically Christian individuality was no longer reached, and this\r\npretended _renaissance_, in which even earnest minds were induced to\r\ngratify themselves, only served to exhibit the feeble efforts of an\r\nepoch that sought to reproduce the glories of a vanished age. In the\r\ntime of Charles VIII. and Louis XII., Lombarde-Venetian art, the\r\naffected and ingenious imitation of the Greek style, was introduced into\r\nFrance; it suited the common people, and pleased mediocre intellect. The\r\nsculptors who came at that period to seek their fortunes at the court of\r\nthe French kings worked exclusively for the aristocracy, and vied with\r\none another in adorning, with an ardent infatuation for Italian art, the\r\nroyal and aristocratic palaces which were being built or restored in\r\nevery direction, such as the Châteaux of Amboise and Gaillon. But they\r\nfailed to do any injury to French artists, who still remained charged\r\nwith the works of sacred sculptures; and their style became but\r\nslightly, if at all, influenced by this foreign immigration. Even\r\nBenvenuto Cellini himself failed to exercise much effect on the vigorous\r\nschools of Tours, Troyes, Metz, Dijon, and Angers; his reputation and\r\nhis works never passed, so to speak, beyond the limits of the court of\r\nFrance, and the brilliant traces they\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 289.--“St. John the Baptist preaching in the\r\nDesert.” Bas-relief in Carved Wood by Albert Dürer.\r\n\r\n(Brunswick Gallery.)]\r\n\r\nleft behind them were confined to the school of Fontainebleau. Ere long,\r\nsome zealous artists from all the principal centres of the French\r\nschools left their country and betook themselves to Italy; among these\r\nwere Bachelier of Languedoc, Simon and Ligier Richier of Lorraine,\r\nValentine Bousch of Alsace, and Jacques of Angoulême, who had the honour\r\nof a victory over his master, Michael Angelo, in a competition of\r\nstatuary (many of the former artist’s works now exist in the Vatican);\r\nJean de Boulogne, and several others. Some of them, after they had\r\nbecome celebrated on the other side of the Alps, returned to their\r\nnative country, bringing back to it their own native genius matured by\r\nthe lessons of the Italians. There was, therefore, always a French\r\nschool that preserved its individual characteristics, its generic good\r\nqualities and defects, which are so well represented in the sculptures\r\nof the Hôtel du Bourgtheroulde, Rouen (Fig. 290).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 290.--Bas-relief of the Hôtel du Bourgtheroulde,\r\nRouen, representing a Scene in the Interview between Francis I. and\r\nHenry VIII., on the Field of the Cloth of Gold.]\r\n\r\nMichael Angelo was born on the 6th of March, 1475, and died on the 17th\r\nof February, 1564, without having shown any signs of decadence; greater,\r\npossibly, by his genius than by his works, he is the personification of\r\nthe Renaissance. It would be, perhaps, irreverent to say that this age\r\nwas an age of decay; we might fear of desecrating the tomb of Buonarotti\r\nif we laid to his charge that his grand boldness led ordinary talents\r\nastray; and it is not a pleasant subject of thought that, influenced by\r\ntwo currents of ideas--one coming from Italy, the other from\r\nGermany--the art of the century operated to its own suicide. When the\r\nvery soil itself seemed to be shaken, and the Christian pedestal which\r\nhad formed both its grandeur and power overturned, what could be done\r\nin the way of opposition to the downfall of Art by Jean Goujon, Jean\r\nCousin (Fig. 291), Germain Pilon, François Marchand, Pierre Bontemps,\r\nthose stars of French sculpture in the sixteenth century?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 291.--Statue in Alabaster of Philip Chabot, Admiral\r\nof France, by Jean Cousin. Formerly in the Church of the Célestins,\r\nParis, now in the Museum of the Louvre.]\r\n\r\nA final manifestation of the old religious feeling was, however,\r\napparent in the tombs of the Church of Brou, designed by Jean Perréal,\r\nthe great painter of Lyons, executed by Conrad Meyt, and carved by\r\nGourat and Michael Columb; also in the mausoleum of Francis II., carved\r\nby Columb and his family; in the sepulchre of St. Mihiel (Fig. 292) by\r\nRichier; of the _Saints de Solesme_, in the tombs of Langey du Bellay,\r\nand of the Chancellor De Birague, by Germain Pilon, &c. But fashion and\r\nthe prevailing taste now required from artists nothing but profane and\r\nvoluptuous compositions, and they adopted this line of Art all the more\r\nreadily, seeing, as they did every day, most beautiful works of\r\nChristian sculpture mutilated by a new tribe of Iconoclasts, the\r\nHuguenots, who seldom showed mercy to the figured monuments in Catholic\r\nchurches. The stalls of the Cathedral of Amiens, by Jean Rupin, the\r\nrood-loft by Jean Boudin, and a number of other works of the same kind,\r\ntestify to the irruption of the Greek style, its implantation in\r\nreligious art, and its hybrid association with pointed architecture. It\r\nis, however, only due to our sculptors of the sixteenth century to say,\r\nthat when they sacrificed themselves to the requirements of their age\r\nin imitating the masterpieces of Italy, they approached the natural\r\ngrace of Raphael much closer than\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 292.--“The Entombment,” by Richier, in the Church of\r\nSt. Mihiel (Meuse). (Sixteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nCellini, Primaticcio, or any of the other Italian artists who were\r\nsettled in France; that they combined in the best possible way the\r\nmythological expression of the ancients with our modern ideas, and\r\nthat, thanks to them, France is enabled to point with pride to a natural\r\nart, original and independent, which has been handed down to our days in\r\ndirect succession by Sarrazain, Puget, Girardon, and Coysevox.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 293, 294.--Gargoyles on the Palace of Justice,\r\nRouen.

But when\r\nthe religion proscribed one day found itself on the next the religion of\r\nthe State, things changed.\r\n\r\nConstantine, in the mighty ardour of his zeal, wished to see the worship\r\nof the true God efface in pomp and in magnificence all the solemnities\r\nof the heathen world. In expelling the idols from their temples, the\r\nidea could not have suggested itself of using these buildings for the\r\nnew religion, because they were generally of excessively limited\r\ndimensions, and the plan on which they were built would have but\r\nindifferently answered the requirements of the Christian ceremonial.\r\nWhat was necessary for these services was principally a spacious nave,\r\nin which a large congregation could assemble to hear the same word, to\r\njoin in the same prayer, and to intone the same chants. The Christians\r\nsought, therefore, among the edifices then in existence (Fig. 295), for\r\nsuch as would best answer these purposes. The _basilicas_ presented\r\nthemselves; these buildings served at once as law-courts and places of\r\nassembly for tradesmen and money-changers, and were generally composed\r\nof one immense hall, with lateral galleries and tribunes adjoining it.\r\nThe name of _basilica_, derived from the Greek word _basileus_ (a king),\r\nwas given them, according to some writers, from the fact that formerly\r\nthe kings themselves used to administer justice within their walls;\r\naccording to others, because the basilica of Athens served as a tribunal\r\nof the second archon, who bore the title of king; whence the edifice was\r\ncalled _stoa basiliké_ (royal porch), a designation of which the Romans\r\npreserved only the adjective, the substantive being understood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 295.--Basilica of Constantine, at Trèves,\r\ntransformed into a Fortress in the Middle Ages.]\r\n\r\n“The Christian basilica,” says M. Vaudoyer, in his learned treatise on\r\narchitecture in France, “was most certainly an imitation of the heathen\r\nbasilica; but it is of importance to observe that from one cause or\r\nanother the Christians, in the construction of their basilicas, very\r\nsoon substituted for the Grecian architecture of the ancient basilicas a\r\nsystem of arches reposing directly on isolated columns, which served as\r\ntheir supports; a perfectly new contrivance, of which there existed no\r\nprevious example. This new mode of construction, which has generally\r\nbeen attributed to the want of skill in the builders of this period, or\r\nto the nature of the materials they had at their disposal, was, however,\r\nto become the fundamental principle of Christian art; a principle\r\ncharacterised by the breaking up of the range of arches, and by the\r\nabandonment of the system of rectilinear construction of the Greeks and\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, the arcade, which had become the dominant element of Roman\r\narchitecture, had nevertheless remained subject to the proportions of\r\nthe Greek orders, of which the entablature served as an indispensable\r\naccompaniment; and from this medley of elements so diverse was produced\r\nthe mixed style which characterises the Greco-Roman architecture. But\r\nthe Christians, in separating or breaking up the arcade, in abandoning\r\nthe use of the ancient orders, and in making the column the real support\r\nof the arch, laid the foundations of a new style, which led to the\r\nexclusive employment of arches and vaults in Christian edifices. The\r\nChurch of St. Sophia at Constantinople, built by Justinian in the middle\r\nof the sixth century, affords the most ancient example of this system of\r\nconstruction by arches and vaults in a Christian church of large\r\ndimensions.”\r\n\r\nTransported to the East, the Latin style there assumed a new character,\r\nowing especially to the adoption and generalisation of the cupola, of\r\nwhich there were some examples in Roman architecture, but only as an\r\naccessory; whereas, in what is called Byzantine architecture, this form\r\nbecame dominant, and, as it were, fundamental; thus, at all periods and\r\nat each time that the architectural influence of the East made itself\r\nfelt in the West, we see the cupola introduced into buildings. The\r\nChurch of St. Vital at Ravenna affords, in its plan (Fig. 296) and in\r\nits general appearance, an example of this influence, which is quite\r\nByzantine.\r\n\r\nEdifices of Latin architecture, properly so called, are rare, we might\r\nalmost say that they have all disappeared (Figs. 297 and 298); but if\r\nsome churches in Rome, whose foundation dates back to the fifth and\r\nsixth centuries, can be considered as specimens of this first period of\r\nChristian art, it is in the arrangement of the plan much more than in\r\nthe details of execution, which for a long subsequent time since have\r\nbeen united with the work of later periods.\r\n\r\nIn the days when Christianity was so triumphantly established as to have\r\nno fear nor scruple to utilise, in the construction of its churches, the\r\nruins\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 296.--Church of St. Vital, at Ravenna. Byzantine\r\nstyle. (Sixth Century.)]\r\n\r\nof the ancient temples, it generally happened that the architect,\r\nconforming himself to new requirements, endeavoured, by a prudent return\r\ntowards the traditions of the past, to avoid those striking\r\nincongruities which would have deprived of all their value the\r\nmagnificent materials he had at his disposal. Hence arose a style still\r\nundecided; hence mixed creations, which it will suffice merely to\r\nmention. Then we must not forget--to say nothing of the case in which,\r\nas in the old Roman city, Christian basilicas might be built with the\r\nmarble of heathen sanctuaries--the monuments of this same Rome were\r\nstill the only models that presented themselves for imitation. Finally,\r\nfor this architecture which the Christian religion was to create as its\r\nown, it was obvious there would be an infancy, an age of groping in the\r\ndark and of uncertainty; and at length that there should be a separation\r\nfrom the past, and a gradually experienced feeling of individual\r\nstrength. (Fig. 299.)\r\n\r\nThis infancy lasted about five or six centuries; for it was only about\r\nthe year 1000 that the new style--which we see at first made up of\r\n“recollections” and weak innovations--assumed an almost determinate\r\nform. This is the period called Norman,[49] which, according to M.\r\nVaudoyer, has left us some monuments that are “the noblest, the\r\nsimplest, and the severest expression of the Christian temple.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 297.--The Church of St. Agnes, at Rome, Latin style\r\n(Fifth Century). Restored and debased in the Seventeenth Century.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 298.--The Church of St. Martin, at Tours (Sixth\r\nCentury). Rebuilt or restored in the Eleventh Century.]\r\n\r\n“Three years after the year 1000, which was supposed was to be the last\r\nyear of the world,” says the monk Raoul Glaber, “churches were renewed\r\nin nearly every part of the universe, especially in Italy and in Gaul,\r\nalthough the greater number were still in a condition good enough to\r\nrequire\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 299.--Remains of the Church of Mouen, in Normandy.\r\nArchitecture of the Fifth or Sixth Century.]\r\n\r\nno repairs.” “It was to this period, that is to say, the eleventh\r\ncentury,” adds M. Vaudoyer, “must be assigned the greater number of the\r\nancient churches of France, grander and more magnificent than all those\r\nof preceding centuries; it was then, also, the first associations of\r\nbuilders were formed, whereof the abbots and the prelates themselves\r\nformed a portion, and which were essentially composed of men bound by a\r\nreligious vow; the Arts were cultivated in the convents, the churches\r\nwere built under the direction of bishops; the monks co-operated in\r\nworks of all kinds.... The plan of the Western churches preserved the\r\nprimitive arrangement of the Latin basilica--that is, the elongated form\r\nand the lateral galleries; the most important modifications were the\r\nlengthening of the choir and of the galleries, or of the cross, a free\r\npassage established round the apse (Fig. 300); and, lastly, the\r\ncombination of chapels, which grouped themselves around the sanctuary.\r\nIn the construction the isolated columns of the nave are sometimes\r\nreplaced by pillars, the spaces between which are filled up with\r\nsemicircular arches,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 300.--Notre-Dame, Rouen, ogival style. (Thirteenth\r\nCentury.)]\r\n\r\nand a general system of vaulted roofs is substituted for the ceilings\r\nand timber roofs of the ancient Latin basilicas.... The use of bells,\r\nwhich was but sparingly adopted in the East, contributed to give to the\r\nchurches of the West a character and an appearance quite their own, and\r\nwhich they owe particularly to those lofty towers that had become the\r\nessential part of their façade.”\r\n\r\nThe façade itself is generally of great simplicity. We enter the edifice\r\nby one of three doors, above which runs, in most cases, a little gallery\r\nformed of very small columns close to each other, supporting a range of\r\narcades; and these arcades are often ornamented with statues, as we find\r\nin the church of Notre-Dame at Poitiers, which--together with the\r\nchurches of Notre-Dame des Doms, at Avignon; of St. Paul, at Issoire; of\r\nSt. Sernin, at Toulouse; of Notre-Dame du Port, at Clermont, &c.--may be\r\nconsidered as one of the most complete specimens of Norman architecture.\r\n\r\nIn churches of this style, as for instance those of St. Front, at\r\nPérigueux; of Notre-Dame, at Puy en Velay; of St. Etienne, at Nevers,\r\nare seen also some cupolas; but we must not forget that the Byzantine\r\narchitects, whose migrations towards the West were constantly taking\r\nplace at this period, could not fail to leave traces of their\r\nwanderings, and we must acknowledge that, especially in our own country\r\n(France), where Oriental influence was never more than partial, the\r\nunion of the two architectonic principles produced the happiest results.\r\nThe Cathedral of Angoulême, for example, is justly regarded as one of\r\nthe edifices in which Oriental taste harmonises the best with the Norman\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this period, the bell-towers were of very little\r\nimportance; but gradually we find them rising higher and higher, and\r\nattaining to great elevations. Some cathedrals on the borders of the\r\nRhine, and the Church of St. Etienne at Caen, are examples of the\r\nextraordinary height to which these towers were built. In principle, we\r\nmay add, there was only one bell-tower (Fig. 301); but it generally\r\nhappened that two were given to churches built or restored after the\r\nyear 1000: St. Germain-des-Prés had three bell-towers--one over the\r\nportal, and one at each side of the transept; certain churches had four\r\nand even five bell-towers.\r\n\r\nNorman bell-towers are generally square, exhibiting, in stories, two or\r\nthree ranges of round-arched arcades, and terminating in a pyramidal\r\nroof resting on an octagonal base. The Abbey of St. Germain d’Auxerre\r\npossesses one of the most remarkable bell-towers of the Norman style;\r\nthen come, although built subsequently to the principal edifice, those\r\nof the Abbaye aux Hommes, at Caen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 301.--Ancient Church of St. Paul-des-Champs, at\r\nParis, founded, in the Seventh Century, by St. Eloi. Restored and in\r\npart rebuilt in the Thirteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nThe sun’s rays penetrated into the Norman church first through the\r\n_oculus_,[50] a vast round opening intended to admit light into the\r\nnave, and situated above the façade, which generally rose in the form of\r\na gable above one or several rows of small columns on the exterior. A\r\nseries of lateral windows opened on the side-aisles of the edifice;\r\nanother was pierced on a level with the galleries; and a third between\r\nthe vaulted arches of the nave.\r\n\r\nThe crypt, a sort of subterranean sanctuary, which generally contained\r\nthe tomb of some beatified saint, or of some martyr to whom the edifice\r\nwas dedicated, formed very often an integral part of the Norman church.\r\nThe architecture of the crypt, which had for its ideal object to recall\r\nto the mind the period when the offices of the Christian religion were\r\nperformed in caverns and in catacombs, was generally of a massive and\r\nimposing severity, well suited to express the sentiment which must have\r\npresided over the earliest Christian buildings.\r\n\r\nThe Norman style, that is to say, the primitive idea of Christian\r\narchitecture, freed from its remaining servility to the antique, seems\r\nto have caught a glimpse of the definitive formula of Christian art.\r\nMany a majestic monument already attested the austere power of this\r\nstyle; and perhaps a final and masterly inspiration would have sufficed,\r\nperfection being attained, to cause the researches of the _maîtres\r\nd’œuvre_,[51] made as they felt their way forward, to cease of\r\nthemselves. Already, too, as a sign of maturity, Norman edifices,\r\ninstead of remaining in the somewhat too unadorned simplicity of the\r\nfirst period, became gradually ornamented, till in time they resembled,\r\nfrom their base to the summit, a delicate work of embroidery. It is to\r\nthis florid Norman style, which in France reigns especially to the south\r\nof the Loire, that the charming façade of the Church of Notre-Dame de\r\nPoitiers (Fig. 302) belongs, which we have already cited as a perfect\r\ntype of the Norman style itself; the façade of St. Trophimus, at Aries\r\n(Figs. 303 and 304), an example in the general arrangement of which the\r\nsame character of original unity does not prevail; and that of the\r\nChurch of St. Gilles, which M. Mérimée cites as the most elegant\r\nexpression of the florid Norman.\r\n\r\nIn short, let us repeat it, the Norman style, grandiose in its\r\nausterity, still quiet and compact even in its richest phantasy, was on\r\nthe eve of _individualising_ for ever, perhaps, Christian architecture;\r\nits rounded arches, uniting their full soft curves to the simple\r\nprofiles of columns, robust even in their lightness, seemed to\r\ncharacterise at one and the same time the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 302.--Notre-Dame la Grande of Poitiers (Twelfth\r\nCentury).]\r\n\r\nelevated calm of hope and the humble gravity of faith. But lo! the\r\n_ogive_ sprang up; not, indeed, as certain authors have thought they\r\nwere right in affirming, from an outburst of spontaneous invention, for\r\nwe find the principle and the application of it not only in many\r\nedifices of the Norman period, but even in the architectural\r\ncontrivances of the most remote times. And it happened that this simple\r\nbreaking up of the round arch, this “sharpness” of the arch, if we may\r\nuse the expression, which the Norman builders had skilfully utilised,\r\ngiving more of slenderness or graceful strength to vaults of great\r\nextent, became the fundamental element of a style which, in less than a\r\ncentury, was to shut the future to a tradition dating from six or eight\r\ncenturies, and which could with justice pride itself on the most\r\nbeautiful architectural conceptions. (Fig. 305.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 303.--Tympanum of the Portal of St. Trophimus, at\r\nArles (Twelfth Century).]\r\n\r\nFrom the twelfth to the thirteenth century the transition took place.\r\nThe Norman style, which is distinguished by its round arch, maintained\r\nthe struggle with the Gothic style, of which the ogive is the original\r\nmark. In the churches of this period we find also, with regard to the\r\nground-plan of edifices, the choir assuming larger dimensions,\r\nnecessitated no doubt by increased ceremonials in the services. The\r\nLatin cross, which was the ground-plan whereon up to this time the\r\ngreater number of sanctuaries were built, ceased to indicate as\r\nprecisely as heretofore its outlines; the nave was raised considerably\r\nin height, the lateral chapels were multiplied, and often broke the\r\nperspective of the side-aisles; bell-towers assumed greater importance,\r\nand the placing of immense organs above the principal entrance gave rise\r\nto a new system of elevated galleries in this part of the building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 304.--Details of the Portal of St. Trophimus, at\r\nArles. (Twelfth Century.)]\r\n\r\nThe churches of St. Remy, Rheims; of the Abbey of St. Denis; of St.\r\nNicholas, Blois; the Abbey of Jumiéges; and the Cathedral of\r\nChâlons-sur-Marne, are the principal examples of the architecture of the\r\nmixed style.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 305.--Cloister of the Abbey of Moissac, Guyenne.\r\n(Twelfth Century.)]\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked that for a long while, in the north of France, the\r\npointed arch had prevailed almost entirely over the round arch, at the\r\ntime when, in the south, Norman tradition, blended with the Byzantine,\r\nstill continued to inspire the builders. Nevertheless, the demarcation\r\ncannot be rigorously established, for, at the time when edifices of the\r\npurest Norman style showed themselves in our (French) northern counties\r\n(as, for example, the Church of St. Germain-des-Prés, and the apse of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DECORATION OF LA SAINTE CHAPELLE, PARIS.\r\n\r\nThirteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nSt. Martin-des-Champs, Paris), we find, at Toulouse, at Carcassonne, at\r\nMontpellier, the most remarkable specimens of the Gothic style. At last\r\nGothic architecture gained the day. “Its principle,” says M. Vitet, “is\r\nin emancipation, in liberty, in the spirit of association and commerce,\r\nin sentiments quite indigenous and quite national: it is homely, and\r\nmore than that, it is French, English, Teutonic, &c. Norman\r\narchitecture, on the contrary, is sacerdotal.”\r\n\r\nAnd M. Vaudoyer adds: “The rounded arch is the determinate and\r\ninvariable form; the pointed arch is the free and indefinite form which\r\nlends itself to unlimited modifications. If, then, the Pointed style has\r\nno longer the austerity of the Norman, it is because it belongs to that\r\nsecond phase of all civilisation, in which elegance and richness replace\r\nthe strength and the severity of primordial types.”\r\n\r\nIt was, moreover, at this period that architecture, like all the other\r\narts, left the monasteries to pass into the hands of lay architects\r\norganised into confraternities, who travelled from place to place, and\r\nthus transmitted the traditional types; the result of this was that\r\nbuildings raised at very great distances from each other presented a\r\nstriking analogy, and often even a complete similitude to each other.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion not only on the origin of the pointed\r\narch, but also as to the beauty and excellence of its form. According to\r\nsome it was suggested by the sight of many arches interlaced, and only\r\nconstituted one of those fantastical forms which an art in quest of\r\nnovelty adopts; others, among whom is M. Vaudoyer, attribute to it the\r\nmost remote origin, by making it result quite naturally in the first\r\nattempts at building in stone,--“from a succession of courses of stone\r\nso arranged that each overhung the other;” or else in wooden\r\nconstructions, “from the greater facility there was in forming with\r\nbeams a pointed rather than a perfectly rounded arch;” others consider\r\nthe adoption of the Pointed style, as we said above, as nothing but a\r\nproof of the religious independence succeeding the rigid faith of\r\nearlier days. A third opinion, again, is that of M. Michiels, who looks\r\non the Pointed style as in some sort an inevitable result of the\r\nboldness of the Norman, and who considers the Gothic, of which it is the\r\ncharacteristic, as “expressing the spirit of a period when religious\r\nfeeling had attained its most perfect maturity, and Catholic\r\ncivilisation produced its sweetest and most agreeable fruits.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 306.--Mayence Cathedral. Rhenish Norman. (Twelfth\r\nand Thirteenth Centuries).]\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the merits of these different opinions, into the\r\ndiscussion of which we need not enter, it is now generally assumed that\r\nthe Pointed style, properly so called, sprang up first within the limits\r\nof the ancient Ile-de-France, whence it propagated itself by degrees\r\ntowards the southern and eastern provinces.\r\n\r\nM. Michiels, agreeing on this point with the celebrated architect\r\nLassus, points out that it would be as difficult to attribute the\r\ncreation of this style to Germany as to Spain. It was in the thirteenth\r\ncentury that the finest Gothic buildings appeared in France; while in\r\nGermany, except the churches built, as it were, on the French frontier,\r\nwe find nothing at that period but Norman churches (Fig. 306); and it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that, if we owed the general adoption of the\r\npointed arch to Spain, the introduction of it would have been gradually\r\nmade through that part of the country situated beyond the Loire, where,\r\nhowever, the Norman style continued to be in great favour when it was\r\nalmost entirely abandoned in the north of France.\r\n\r\nA century sufficed to bring the Pointed style to its highest perfection.\r\nNotre-Dame (Fig. 307) and the Sainte-Chapelle, in Paris; Notre-Dame,\r\nChartres; the cathedrals of Amiens (Fig. 308), Sens, Bourges, Coutances,\r\nin France; those of Strasbourg, Fribourg, Altenberg, and Cologne, in\r\nGermany, the dates of whose construction succeed each other at intervals\r\nfrom the first half of the twelfth to the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, are so many admirable specimens or types of this art, which we\r\nmay here call relatively new.\r\n\r\nTo know to what marvellous variety of combinations and effects, by\r\nmerely modifying it in height and breadth from its original type, this\r\npointed arch, which, taken by itself, might appear the simplest of\r\nforms, can attain, one must have passed some time in dividing into the\r\ndifferent parts of which it is composed, by an accurate examination of\r\nits _tout ensemble_, such an edifice as Notre-Dame, Paris, or as the\r\nCathedral of Strasbourg; the first of which attracts attention by the\r\nsustained boldness of its lines, strong as they are graceful; the\r\nsecond, by its perfectly bold independence, seeming, as it does, to\r\ntaper away as by enchantment, in order to bear to a surprising height\r\nthe evidence of its incomprehensible temerity.\r\n\r\nWe must rise in thought above the edifice to grasp the plan of its first\r\nconception; we must, from below, study it on all sides to perceive\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 307.--Notre-Dame, Paris (Twelfth and Thirteenth\r\nCenturies).\r\n\r\nView of the principal Façade before the restoration executed by Messrs.\r\nLassus and Viollet-le-Duc.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 308.--Interior of Amiens Cathedral. (Thirteenth\r\nCentury.)]\r\n\r\nwith what art its various parts are arranged, grouped, placed at certain\r\nintervals from each other; we must seek to discover the contrivance by\r\nvirtue of which the immense _évidage_ (sloping) of numerous buttresses,\r\nthe height of the towers, the retiring of the laterals, and the curve of\r\nthe apse are harmonised; we must enter the church and stand in its nave,\r\nwith its interminable delicate ribs--how many clusters of small columns\r\nextend above the slender pillars!--we must contemplate the beautiful\r\nfancies of the rose-windows, which by their many-coloured glass sober\r\ndown the glare of the light passing through them; we must gain the\r\nsummit of those towers, those spires, and from them command the dizzy\r\nextent of aërial\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 309.--Capital of a Column in the Abbey of St.\r\nGeneviève (destroyed), Paris.\r\n\r\n(Eleventh Century.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 310.--Capital of a Column in the Church of St.\r\nJulien the Poor (destroyed), Paris.\r\n\r\n(Twelfth Century.)]\r\n\r\nspace, and the landscape stretching out around them below; we must\r\nfollow attentively with our eye the strikingly bold outlines which the\r\nturrets, the ornamented gables, the _guivres_, the tops of the\r\nbell-towers trace upon the sky. This done, we should yet have paid but a\r\nbrief tribute of attention to these prodigious edifices. What, then, if\r\nwe wished to devote sufficient time to the ornamentation of the details\r\n(Figs. 309 to 312)? if we desired to obtain a tolerably exact idea of\r\nthe people from the statues which swarm from the porch to the pinnacle,\r\nand of the _flora_ and _fauna_, real or ideal, that give movement to\r\nevery projection or animate every wall? if one counted on success in\r\nfinding out the key to all the crossings and intersections of the\r\nlines, of the well-adjusted conceptions which, while they deceive the\r\neye, contribute to the majesty or the solidity of the whole? if,\r\nfinally, we were most careful not to lose any one of the multifarious\r\nthoughts that have been fixed in the stones of the gigantic edifice? The\r\nmind becomes confused; and certainly the effect produced by so much\r\nimagination and so much enterprise, by so much skill and taste,\r\nwonderfully elevates the soul, which searches with more love after the\r\nCreator when it sees such a work proceeding from the hands of the\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 311.--Vestige of the Architecture of the Goths at\r\nToledo. (Seventh Century.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 312.--Capital in the Church of the Célestins\r\n(destroyed), Paris. (Fourteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nWhen you approach the Gothic church, when you stand beneath its lofty\r\nroof, it is as if a new country were receiving you, possessing you,\r\ncasting around you an atmosphere of subduing reverie in which you feel\r\nyour wretched servitude to worldly interests vanishing away, and you\r\nbecome conscious of more solid, more important ties, springing up in\r\nyou. The Deity whom our finite nature can figure to ourselves seems in\r\nfact to inhabit this immense building, to be willing to put himself in\r\ndirect communion with the humble Christian who approaches to bow down\r\nbefore Him. There is nothing in it of the human dwelling-place--all\r\nrelating to our poor and miserable existence is here forgotten; He for\r\nwhom this residence was constructed is the Strong, the Great, the\r\nMagnificent, and it is from a paternal condescension that He receives us\r\ninto His holy habitation, as weak, little, miserable. It is the ideal of\r\nthe faith which is realised; all the articles of the belief in which we\r\nhave been brought up are here embodied before our eyes; it is, lastly,\r\nthe chosen spot where the meeting of mortal nothingness and Divine\r\nMajesty is quietly accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe Christianity of the Middle Ages had then been able to find in the\r\nGothic style a tongue as tractable as it was energetic, as simple as it\r\nwas ingenious, which, for the pious excitement of souls, was to declare\r\nto the senses all its ineffable poetry. But as the unbounded faith, of\r\nwhich it was the faithful organ, was on the next dawn of its most ardent\r\naspirations about to decline, so this splendid style was almost as soon\r\nto lose its vigour, and to exhaust itself in the unrestrained\r\nmanifestation of its power.\r\n\r\nSpringing into existence with the warm enthusiasm of the first Crusades,\r\nthe Pointed style seems to follow in its different phases the decline of\r\nfaith in the time of these adventurous enterprises. It began by a\r\nsincere outburst, and was produced by a bold, unshackled genius; then a\r\nfactitious or reflected ardour gave birth to elaborateness and\r\nmannerism; then the fervent zeal and the artistic sentiment dwindled\r\naway: this is the decadency.\r\n\r\nGothic art raised itself in less than a century to its culminating\r\npoint; within two centuries more it was to reach the fatal point where\r\nit would begin to decline. The thirteenth century saw it in all its\r\nglory, with the edifices we have mentioned; in the fourteenth it had\r\nbecome the Florid or _Rayonnant_ Gothic, which produced the churches of\r\nSt. Ouen at Rouen, and of St. Etienne at Metz. “Then,” says M. A.\r\nLefèvre, one of the latest historians of architecture, “no more walls;\r\neverywhere open screen-work supported by slender arcades; no more\r\ncapitals, rows of foliage imitated directly from nature; no more\r\ncolumns, lofty pillars ornamented with round or bevelled mouldings. As\r\nyet, however, there was nothing weakly in its extreme elegance; slim and\r\ndelicate without being gaunt, the Florid style did not in the least\r\ndisfigure the churches of the thirteenth century, which it bounded and\r\ndecorated.\r\n\r\n“But after the _Rayonnant_ Gothic came the _Flamboyant_, which, always\r\nunder the pretext of lightness and grace, denaturalises the ornaments,\r\nthe forms, and even the proportions of the architectural members. It\r\neffaces the horizontal lines which used to give two stories to the\r\nwindows of the nave, fills up the nave with irregular compartments,\r\n_cœurs_, _soufflets_, and _flammes_; suppresses the angles of the\r\npillars and sharpens the mouldings; leaves even to the most massive\r\nsupports nothing but an undulating, vanishing, impalpable form, where\r\nshadow cannot fix itself; changes the lancet-arches into braces, or into\r\nflat-arched vaults more or less depressed, and the florid ornamentation\r\nof the pinnacles into whimsical scrolls. It reserved all its riches for\r\naccessory or exterior decorations, stalls, pulpits, hanging key-stones,\r\nrunning friezes, rood-screens, and bell-towers. Visible decadency of the\r\nwhole corresponds with great progress in details.” (Fig. 313.)\r\n\r\nThe churches of St. Wulfran, Abbeville; of Notre-Dame, Cléry-sur-Loire;\r\nof St. Riquier; of Corbeil; and the cathedrals of Orleans and of Nantes,\r\nmay be cited as the principal specimens of the _Flamboyant_ style, and\r\nas the last notable manifestations of an art which thenceforward\r\ndiverged more and more from its original inspiration. The middle of the\r\nfifteenth century is generally fixed as the limit beyond which the\r\nhandsome Gothic buildings that still rose were no longer, in any degree,\r\nthe normal productions of their period, but were felicitous copies or\r\nimitations of works already consecrated by the history of the art.\r\n\r\nA remark may here be made showing to what extent religious feeling\r\npredominated in the Middle Ages; it is that at the very moment when the\r\nNorman and Gothic architects were designing and producing so many\r\nmarvellous habitations for the Deity, they seemed to bestow scarcely any\r\nattention on the construction of comfortable or luxurious dwellings for\r\nman, even those destined for the most exalted personages of the State.\r\nIn proportion as this sentiment of original faith lost its intensity,\r\nArt occupied itself more and more with princely and lordly habitations.\r\nThe middle class was the last favoured by this progress, and the feeling\r\nof their position as citizens had taken the place of a zeal exclusively\r\npious; so we find the “town-halls” absorbing the splendour and elegance\r\nof which private houses remained destitute; these being generally built\r\nof wood and plaster, and in the heart of the towns, so close together\r\nthat they seemed to be disputing for light and air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 313.--Saloon of the Schools, Oxford. (Fourteenth\r\nCentury.)]\r\n\r\nEverywhere, during the Middle Ages, rose the church--the home of peace;\r\nbut everywhere also towered up at the same time the castle, that\r\ncharacterised the permanent state of war in which feudal society lived,\r\ndelighted, and gloried.\r\n\r\n“The castles of the richest and most powerful nobles,” says M. Vaudoyer,\r\n“consisted of irregular, uncomfortable buildings, pierced with a few\r\nnarrow windows, standing within one or two fortified enclosures, and\r\nsurrounded by moats. The donjon, a large high tower, generally occupied\r\nthe centre, and other towers, more or less numerous, flanked the walls,\r\nand served for the defence of the place.” (Fig. 314). “These castles,”\r\nadds M. Mérimée, “generally present the same characteristics as the\r\nancient _castellum_; but a certain ruggedness, a striking quaintness in\r\nplan and execution, bear witness to a personal will, and that tendency\r\nto isolation which is the instinctive sentiment of the feudal system.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 314.--Ancient Castle of Marcoussis, near\r\nRambouillet. (Thirteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nIn most of the buildings destined for the privileged classes, it seems\r\nas if it were deemed unnecessary that care should be taken to secure\r\nharmony of form. The decorative style of the period showed itself\r\nchiefly in the interior of some of the principal apartments, the\r\nhabitable quarters of the lord of the castle and of his family. There\r\nwere vast fireplaces with enormous chimney-corners surmounted by\r\nprojecting mantelpieces; the vaulted roof was ornamented with pendents\r\nof various devices, and with painted or carved escutcheons. Narrow\r\nclosets, contrived in the walls, served as sleeping places. The\r\nembrasures of the windows pierced in the excessively thick walls formed\r\nso many little chambers, raised a few steps above the floor of the room\r\nto which they admitted light. Stone seats ran along each side of these\r\nembrasures. Here the inmates of the tower generally sat when the cold\r\ndid not oblige them to draw near to the fireplaces. (Figs. 315 and 316.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 315.--Staircase of a Tower.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 316.--Pointed Window with Stone Seats.\r\n\r\n(Thirteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of these slight sacrifices made to the comforts of\r\nlife, everything in the castle was arranged, contrived, and disposed\r\nwith a view to strength and resistance; and yet it cannot be denied\r\nthat, unintentionally, the builders of these silent (_taciturnes_)\r\nedifices have many a time--aided often, it is true, by the picturesque\r\nsites which encircle their works--attained to a majesty of height and a\r\ngrandeur of form truly extraordinary.\r\n\r\nIf the Norman church expresses with gentle severity, and the Gothic\r\nchurch with sumptuous fancy, the important and sublime doctrines of the\r\nGospel, we must equally allow that the castle, in some sort, loudly\r\nproclaims the stern and uncivilised notions of the feudal authority of\r\nwhich it was at once the instrument and the symbol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 317.--The Castle of Coucy in its ancient state.\r\n\r\n(From a Miniature taken from a Manuscript of the Thirteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nPlaced, in most cases, on natural or artificial eminences, it is not\r\nwithout a sort of eloquent boldness that the towers and the donjons\r\nshoot into the air, succeed each other at intervals, command and support\r\neach other. It is frequently not without a sort of fantastic grace that\r\nthe walls scale the rising ground, making an infinity of the strangest\r\nbends, or coiling themselves about with the supple ease of a serpent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 318.--The Castle of Vincennes, as it was in the\r\nSeventeenth Century.]\r\n\r\nEvidently, if the castle raises its gloomy head high into the air, it\r\nhas no other object in doing so than to secure to itself the advantages\r\nof distance and height; but not the less on that account does it stand\r\nout on the sky a grand object. The masses of its walls unsymmetrically\r\npierced with sombre loop-holes present an abrupt and naked appearance;\r\nbut the monotony of their lines is picturesquely broken by the\r\nprojection of overhanging turrets, by the corbels of the machicolated\r\narches, and by the embrasures of the battlements.\r\n\r\nA vast amount of civilisation still exists for him who recalls the past\r\nin the multitude of ruins which were the witnesses of bloody feudal\r\ndivisions; and we must add to the system of isolated castles that often\r\ncommanded the most deserted valleys, the apparatus of strength and\r\ndefence of cities and towns--gates, ramparts, towers, citadels, &c.,\r\nimmense works which, although inspired solely by the genius of strife\r\nand dissension, did not fail nevertheless, in many instances, to combine\r\nharmony and variety of detail with the general grandeur of the whole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 319.--Tour de Nesle, which occupied the site of the\r\nExchange on the banks of the Seine, Paris.\r\n\r\n(From an Engraving of the Seventeenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nWe may cite, as examples of architecture purely feudal, the castles of\r\nCoucy (Fig. 317), Vincennes (Fig. 318), Pierrefonds, the old Louvre, the\r\nBastille, the Tour de Nesle (Fig. 319), the Palais de Justice,\r\nPlessis-les-Tours, &c.; and as specimens of the fortified town in the\r\nMiddle Ages, Avignon and the city of Carcassonne. Let us add that\r\nAigues-Mortes, in Provence; Narbonne, Thann (Haut-Rhin), Vendôme,\r\nVilleneuve-le-Roi, Moulins, Moret (Fig. 320), Provins (Fig. 321), afford\r\nyet again the most characteristic remains of analogous fortifications.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 320.--Gate of Moret. (Twelfth Century.)]\r\n\r\nWhile the nobles, jealous and suspicious, sheltered themselves in the\r\nshadow of their donjons built with many strategical contrivances and of\r\nsubstantial materials; while the large and small towns were surrounded\r\nwith deep moats, high walls, impregnable towers, the most primitive\r\nsimplicity presided over the construction of private dwellings. Stone\r\nhardly ever, and brick but seldom, figured among the number of the\r\nmaterials employed. Sawed or squared timbers serving as ribs, mud or\r\nclay filling up the interstices, were all that was at first required for\r\nthe erection of houses as small as they were comfortless, and following\r\neach other in irregular lines along the narrow streets. The beams of\r\nthe corbels, it is true, began to be adorned with carvings and\r\npaintings, the façades with panes (glass) of different colours; but we\r\nmust reach the last half of the fifteenth century before we see the\r\nresources of architecture applied to the erection and ornamentation of\r\nprivate houses. Moreover, faith was already growing weak; and no longer\r\nwas it possible to direct all the resources of an entire province to the\r\nhonour of the Deity by the erection of a church; the use of gunpowder,\r\nby revolutionising the art of war, came to lessen, if it did not\r\nannihilate, the vast strength of walls; the decline of feudalism itself\r\nhad commenced; and, lastly, the enfranchisement of corporations gave\r\nrise to a perfectly new order of individuals who took their place in\r\nhistory. We must refer to this period the house of Jacques Cœur,\r\nBourges; the Hôtel de Sens, Paris (Fig. 322); the Palais de Justice,\r\nRouen; and those town-halls in which the belfry was then considered as a\r\nsort of palladium, in whose shade the sacred rights of the community\r\nsheltered themselves. It is in our (French) northern towns--St. Quentin,\r\nArras, Noyon; and in the ancient cities of Belgium--Brussels (Fig. 323),\r\nLouvain, Ypres, that these edifices assume the most sumptuous character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 321.--Gate of St. John, with Drawbridge, Provins.\r\n(Fourteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nIn Germany, where for a time it reigned almost exclusively, Gothic art\r\nestablished the cathedrals of Erfurt, of Cologne, Fribourg, and of\r\nVienna; then it died away in the growth of the _Flamboyant_ style. In\r\nEngland, after having left some magnificent examples of pure\r\ninspiration, it found its decline in the attenuated meagreness and the\r\ncomplicated ornamentation of the style called _Perpendicular ogival_. If\r\nit penetrated also into Spain, it was to contend with difficulty against\r\nthe mighty Moorish school, which had too many imposing _chefs-d’œuvre_\r\nin the past to surrender without resistance the country of its former\r\ntriumphs (Fig. 324). In Italy it clashed not only with the Latin and\r\nByzantine schools, but also with a style that, just beginning to form\r\nitself, was soon to dispute with it the empire of taste, and to dethrone\r\nit in that very land which had been its cradle. The cathedrals of\r\nAssisi, of Siena, of Milan, are the splendid works in which its\r\ninfluence triumphed over local traditions and over the _Renaissance_\r\nthat was preparing to follow; yet we must not think that it succeeded\r\neven there in rendering itself absolutely the master, as it had done on\r\nthe Rhenish or British territories. Sacrifices were made in its favour;\r\nbut these sacrifices did not amount to an entire immolation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 322.--Doorways of the Hôtel de Sens, at Paris; the\r\nlast remaining portion of the Hôtel Royal de\r\n\r\nSaint-Pol, built in the reign of Charles V. (Fourteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nWhen we use the word _Renaissance_, we seem to be speaking of a return\r\nto an age already gone by, of the resurrection of a period that had\r\npassed away. It is not strictly in this sense that the word must be\r\nunderstood in the present instance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 323.--Belfry of Brussels (Fifteenth Century), from\r\nan engraving of the Seventeenth Century.]\r\n\r\nInheriting from of old the artistic temperament of Greece, rather than\r\nspontaneously creating of herself any style, Italy, among all the\r\nnations of Europe, was the country which had most successfully resisted\r\nthe profound\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 324.--Interior of the Palace of the Alhambra, at\r\nGranada.--(Thirteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\ndarkness of barbarism, and the first on which the light of modern\r\ncivilisation shone.\r\n\r\nAt the period of this new dawn of genius, Italy had only to ransack the\r\nruins its first magnificence had bequeathed it to find among them\r\nexamples it might follow; moreover, it was the time when the active\r\nrivalry of its republics caused all the treasures of ancient Greece to\r\nflow into it. But while it derived inspiration from these abundant\r\nmanifestations of another age, it never entertained the idea of\r\nabandoning itself exclusively to a servile imitation; it had--and in\r\nthis consists its chief title to glory--while giving a peculiar\r\ndirection to the revivals of the antique, the good sense to remain under\r\nthe poetic influence of that simple and congenial art which had consoled\r\nthe world during the whole continuance of that protracted infancy of a\r\ncivilisation which was at last advancing with rapid strides towards\r\nperfect manhood.\r\n\r\nFrom the twelfth century, Pisa gave an impetus to the art by building\r\nits Duomo, its Baptistery, its Leaning Tower, and the cloisters of its\r\nfamous Campo Santo; so many admirable works forming an era in the\r\nhistory of modern art, and in a brilliant manner opening the career on\r\nwhich so many distinguished men were to enter, rivalling each other in\r\ninvention, in science, and in genius. In these monuments the union of\r\nOriental taste with the traditions of ages gone by created an\r\noriginality as grand as it was graceful. “It is,” as M. A. Lefèvre\r\npoints out, “the Antique without its nudity, the Byzantine without its\r\nheaviness, the fervour of the Western Gothic without its ghastliness”\r\n(_effroi_).\r\n\r\nIn 1294 the magistrates of Florence passed the following decree,\r\ncharging the architect, Arnolfo di Cambio, to convert into a cathedral\r\nthe church, till then of little importance, of Santa Maria de’\r\nFiori:--“Forasmuch,” they said, “as it is in the highest degree prudent\r\nfor a people of illustrious origin to proceed in their affairs in such\r\nmanner that their public works may cause their grandeur and wisdom to be\r\nacknowledged, the order is given to Arnolfo, master-architect of our\r\ntown, to make plans for repairing the Church of Santa Maria with the\r\ngreatest and most lavish magnificence, so that the skill and prudence of\r\nmen may never invent, nor ever be able to undertake, anything more\r\nimportant or more beautiful.”\r\n\r\nArnolfo applied himself to his task, and conceived a plan which the\r\nshortness of human life did not allow him to carry out; but Giotto\r\nsucceeded\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 325.--Interior of the Basilica of St. Peter’s,\r\nRome.]\r\n\r\nhim, and to Giotto succeeded Orcagna, and to Orcagna, Brunelleschi, who\r\ndesigned and almost completed that Duomo, of which Michael Angelo said\r\nit would be difficult to equal, and impossible to surpass, it.\r\n\r\nArnolfo, Giotto, Orcagna, Brunelleschi--does it not suffice to cite\r\nthese great names for us to form an idea of the movement going on at\r\nthis period? and which was soon to produce Alberti, Bramante, Michael\r\nAngelo, Jacques della Porta, Baldassare Peruzzi, Antonio and Juliano de\r\nSangallo, Giocondo, Vignola, Serlio, and even Raphael, who, when he\r\nliked, was as mighty an architect as he was a marvellous painter. It was\r\nin Rome that these princes of the art congregated together, as the\r\nsplendours of St. Peter’s (Fig. 325), to mention only one of their grand\r\ncreations, still attest; so, it is from this city that henceforward\r\nlight and example are to come.\r\n\r\nIn the style which this masterly phalanx created, the Latin rounded arch\r\nregained all its ancient favour, and united itself to the ancient\r\norders, which became intermingled, or, at any rate, superposed. The\r\nogive was abandoned, but the columns to decorate their capitals, and the\r\nentablatures to give more grace to their projections, borrowed a certain\r\nfantastical style which yielded in nothing to the ogival; the Grecian\r\npediment reappeared, changing sometimes the upper lines of its triangle\r\ninto a depressed semicircle; lastly the cupola, that striking object\r\nwhich was the characteristic feature of the Byzantine style, became the\r\ndome, whose ample curve defied, in the daring heights whereto it rose,\r\nthe wonders of the Perpendicular Gothic.\r\n\r\nThe Italian _Renaissance_ was now accomplished, the Gothic age at an\r\nend. Rome and Florence sent in every direction their architects, who, as\r\nthey travelled far from these metropolises of the new style, were once\r\nmore subjected to certain territorial influences, but who knew how to\r\nmake the tradition of which they were the apostles triumphant. It was\r\nthen that France inaugurated in its turn a Renaissance peculiar to\r\nherself; it was then that, under the reign of Charles VIII., after his\r\nexpedition into Italy, began, with the Château de Gaillon, a long\r\nsuccession of edifices, which in many cases yielded neither in richness\r\nnor in majesty to the works of the preceding period. Under Louis XII.\r\nrose the Château de Blois, and the Hôtel de la Cour des Comptes, Paris,\r\na splendid building destroyed by fire in the eighteenth century. Under\r\nFrancis I., Chambord (Fig. 326), Fontainebleau, Madrid (near Paris),\r\nmagnificent royal “humours,” contended in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 326.--Château de Chambord, with its Ancient Moat.\r\n(Seventeenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nelegance and grace with the châteaux of Nantouillet, Chenonceaux, and\r\nAzai-le-Rideau; and with the manor-house of Ango, near Dieppe, all\r\nsumptuous, lordly mansions; the old Louvre, the palace of kings, the\r\ncradle of monarchy, was regenerated under the care of Peter Lescot; the\r\nHôtel de Ville, Paris, still bears witness to the varied talent of\r\nDominique Cortona, who, as M. Vaudoyer said of him, “justly understood\r\nthat, in building for France, he should act in a perfectly different\r\nmanner to that in which he would have acted in Italy.” Under Henry II.\r\nand Charles IX. this activity continued, and the architects who sought\r\ntheir inspirations in Grecian and Roman antiquity, as much as in the\r\n_souvenirs_ of the Italian Renaissance, delighted in loading all the\r\nelegant and graceful buildings with ornaments, with bas-reliefs, and\r\nwith statues, which they seemed to carve in the stone, as delicately\r\nwrought as a piece of goldsmith’s work. Philibert Delorme built for\r\nDiana of Poitiers the Château d’Anet, that architectural jewel whose\r\nportico, transported piece by piece at the time of the revolutionary\r\ndisorders, now decorates the court of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts; Jean\r\nBullant built Ecouen for the Constable Anne de Montmorency; and the\r\narchitect d’Anet undertook, by order of Catherine de Medicis, the\r\nconstruction of the Palace of the Tuileries, which, by a sort of\r\nexigency resulting from its particular destination, seemed typically to\r\ncharacterise the style of the French Renaissance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 327.--Porte de Hal, Brussels. (Fourteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nWe must not burden with details this summary of one of the most\r\nimportant branches of art. The history of architecture is among those\r\nvast domains which demand either a short epitome or a thoroughly deep\r\ninvestigation. The epitome being alone consistent with the plan of our\r\nwork, we must confine ourselves to its limits; but we may, perhaps, be\r\nallowed to think that the few rapid pages thus devoted to the subject\r\nhave inspired the reader with the desire of penetrating farther into a\r\nstudy which is capable of offering him so many agreeable surprises, so\r\nmany rational delights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARCHMENT AND PAPER.\r\n\r\n     Parchment in Ancient Times.--Papyrus.--Preparation of Parchment and\r\n     Vellum in the Middle Ages.--Sale of Parchment at the Fair of\r\n     Lendit.--Privilege of the University of Paris on the Sale and\r\n     Purchase of Parchment.--Different Applications of\r\n     Parchment.--Cotton Paper imported from China.--Order of the Emperor\r\n     Frederick II. concerning Paper.--The Employment of Linen Paper\r\n     dating from the Twelfth Century.--Ancient Water-Marks on\r\n     Paper.--Paper Manufactories in France and other parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough most authors who speak of parchment attribute the invention of\r\nit, on the testimony of Pliny, to Eumenius, king of Pergamus\r\n(doubtlessly from the etymology of the word by which it was designated,\r\nviz., _Pergamena_), it seems to be proved, according to Peignot, that\r\nthe use of it is much more ancient, and that its origin is utterly lost.\r\nCertainly, in many passages of the Old Testament we find a Hebrew Word,\r\nin Latin _volumen_, which can only be understood to mean a roll formed\r\nof prepared skin or of the leaves of papyrus, and it is consequently\r\nevident that the Jews, from the time of Moses, wrote the tables of the\r\nLaw on rolls of parchment.\r\n\r\nHerodotus says that the Ionians called books _diphthera_ (διφθἑρα, a\r\nprepared hide), because, at a time when the _biblos_ (βἱβλος, the inner\r\nbark of the papyrus) was scarce, they wrote on skins of goats or of\r\nsheep. Diodorus Siculus affirms that the ancient Persians wrote their\r\nannals on skins, and we must suppose that Pliny’s assertion refers only\r\nto some improvements the King of Pergamus had made in the art of\r\npreparing a material that could supply the place of papyrus, which\r\nPtolemy Epiphanius would no longer allow to leave Egypt. The absolute\r\ndeficiency of papyrus raised into activity the fabrication of parchment,\r\nand soon so large a quantity was seen to flow into Pergamus that this\r\ntown was considered as the cradle of the new trade, already so\r\nflourishing. There were then books of two kinds, the one in rolls\r\ncomposed of many leaves sewed together, on one side of which only was\r\nthere writing; the others, square-shaped, were written upon both sides.\r\nThe grammarian Crates, ambassador of Eumenius at Rome, passed as the\r\ninventor of vellum.\r\n\r\nOrdinary parchment is the skin of a goat, sheep, or lamb, prepared in\r\nlime, dressed, scraped, and rendered smooth by pumice-stone. Its\r\nprincipal qualities are whiteness, thinness, and stiffness; but the work\r\nof the currier must have been formerly very imperfect, for Hildebert,\r\nArchbishop of Tours in the eleventh century, tells us that the writer,\r\nbefore beginning his occupation, “was in the habit of clearing away from\r\nthe parchment, with the aid of a razor, the remains of fat and other\r\ngross impurities, and then with pumice-stone to make the hair and\r\ntendons disappear:” this almost amounts to affirming that the scribes\r\nbought the hide undressed, and, by an elaborate preparation, made them\r\nfit for proper use. Virgin parchment, which in its grain and colour\r\nresembles vellum, was made of the skins of those lambs and goats which\r\nhad been clipped. Vellum, more polished, whiter, more transparent, is\r\nmade, as its name indicates, of the hide of the calf.[52]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that with the Romans, papyrus, considering the facility\r\nthey had of procuring it for themselves, was more frequently used than\r\nparchment, which, at first, was rare and costly. But parchment, more\r\ndurable and of greater resistance than papyrus, was reserved for the\r\ntranscription of the most important works. Cicero, who had many books on\r\nparchment in his magnificent library, said that he had seen the “Iliad”\r\ncopied on a scroll of _pergamena_ which went into a nut-shell. Many of\r\nMartial’s epigrams prove to us that in the time of this poet books of\r\nsuch kind were still more numerous. Unfortunately, there remains to us\r\nno writing on parchment dating from this distant period. The Virgil in\r\nthe Vatican, and the Terence at Florence, are of the fourth and fifth\r\ncentury of our era. Admitting that time destroys all, and also that the\r\nwork of the rude tribes on many occasions assisted this natural cause of\r\ndestruction, we must not forget that at certain periods, to supply the\r\nplace of new parchment when it was scarce, a plan had been devised of\r\nmaking the parchment rolls which had already been used for manuscripts\r\nserve again\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 328.--Miniature of the Ninth Century, representing\r\nan Evangelist who is transcribing with the _Calamus_, on Parchment, the\r\nSacred Text, of which he is receiving the revelation.\r\n\r\n(Bibl. de Bourgogne, Brussels.)]\r\n\r\nfor a similar purpose, either by scraping and rubbing them with\r\npumice-stone, or by boiling them in water or soaking in lime. There is\r\nno doubt but the scarceness and the dearness of parchment was the cause\r\nof the loss of very many excellent works. Muratori cites, for example, a\r\nmanuscript of the Ambrosian Library, of which the writing, dating from\r\neight or nine centuries back, had been substituted for another of more\r\nthan a thousand years old; and Maffei informs us that the employment of\r\nancient parchment scraped and washed became so general, in the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries, throughout Germany, that the\r\nEmperors put a stop to this dangerous abuse by issuing an order to the\r\nnotaries to use nothing but parchment “quite new.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 329.--View of the Ancient Abbey of St. Denis and its\r\nDependencies.]\r\n\r\nGenerally, the quality of parchment serves to determine the date of its\r\nmanufacture. The vellum of manuscripts till the middle of the eleventh\r\ncentury is very white and thin; the parchment of the twelfth century is\r\nthick, rough, and brownish, which often shows it has been scraped or\r\nwashed. The greater number of fine manuscripts are on\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 330.--Seal of the University of Paris (Fourteenth\r\nCentury), after one of the Dies preserved in the Collection of Medals in\r\nthe Imperial Library, Paris.]\r\n\r\nvirgin parchment, which from its nature was suited to the delicacies of\r\ncalligraphy and illumination. Moreover, we see from a statute of the\r\nUniversity of Paris, dated 1291, that the parchment trade had attained\r\nat that period to considerable development; so, as a protection against\r\nthe frauds and deceptions which might result from the great competition\r\nof traders in it, and to insure a good article being furnished to\r\nstudents and artists, a special privilege was granted to the university,\r\nwhich, in the person of its rector, had not only the right of\r\ninspection, but also the refusal of all parchment bought in Paris, no\r\nmatter whence it had come. Besides which, at the fair of Lendit, which\r\nwas held every year at Saint-Denis, on the domains of the abbey (Fig.\r\n329), and at the fair of Saint-Lazare, the rector likewise caused the\r\nparchment brought to them to be examined, and the merchants of Paris\r\ncould not purchase any till the king’s agents, those of the Bishop of\r\nParis, and the masters and scholars of the university, had provided\r\nthemselves with what they required (Fig. 330). Let us add that the\r\nrector was paid a duty on all parchment sold, and the result of this\r\ntax was the only source of income attached to the rectorship in the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nAlthough white parchment seems to be the best suited for writing, the\r\nMiddle Ages, following the example of antiquity, gave to the material\r\nvarious tints, especially purple and yellow. The purple was chiefly\r\nintended to receive characters of gold or silver. The Emperor\r\nMaximinius, the younger, inherited from his mother the works of Homer\r\ninscribed in gold on purple vellum; and parchment tinted in this way\r\nwas, during the first centuries, one of the prerogatives reserved for\r\nprinces and the great dignitaries of the Church. It is remarkable that\r\nthe barbarism of the seventh and eighth centuries did not diminish the\r\nfavour in which these luxurious manuscripts were held. Little by little,\r\nhowever, the custom (of writing the entire work in gold or colours)\r\ndwindled away. Scribes began by colouring a few pages only in each\r\nvolume, then some margins or frontispieces; and lastly this decoration\r\nwas restricted to the heads of chapters, or to words to which great\r\nprominence was to be given, or to capital letters. The _rubricatores_\r\n(literally, writers in red), workmen who performed this operation, came\r\nin time to be mere painters of letters or _rubrics_ (so called because\r\nthey were originally painted red), of whose assistance, however, the\r\nfirst printers availed themselves to _rubric_ or colour the initials of\r\nmissals, Bibles, and law books.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions or sizes of our books at the present day have their\r\norigin in the sizes of the parchment in olden times. The entire skin of\r\nthe animal, cut square and folded in two, represented the “in-folio,”\r\nwhich, moreover, varied in length and breadth; and we have every reason\r\nto suppose that paper, from the day it was invented, followed the\r\nordinary sizes of the folded parchment.\r\n\r\nAs to the dimensions of the parchment employed for diplomas, they varied\r\naccording to the time, the brevity of the matter, or the nature of its\r\nemployment. Among the ancients, who wrote only on one side of the\r\nparchment, the skins were cut in bands joined together so as to form\r\n_volumes_ or rolls, which were unrolled as their contents were read.\r\nThis custom was preserved for public and judicial acts for a long time\r\nafter the invention of the square book (_codex_) had caused the\r\n_opisthographic_ writing to be adopted, by which is to be understood\r\nwriting on both sides of the page. In principle, only the final formulæ,\r\nor the signatures, were written on the back of the document. By degrees\r\npeople adopted the practice of writing on the back as well as the front\r\nof the page; but it was not till the sixteenth century that this custom\r\nbecame general.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 331.--Seal of the King of La Basoche. (This title\r\nwas suppressed, with all its prerogatives, by Henry III.)]\r\n\r\nJudicial acts, composed sometimes of many skins sewed together, came in\r\ntime to form rolls of twenty feet in length; to such extreme proportions\r\ndid they reach, though at first they were so small in size that their\r\nlimited dimensions are truly incredible; for in 1233 and 1252 we find\r\ncontracts of sales of two inches long by five inches wide, and in 1258 a\r\nwill written on a piece of parchment of two inches by three and a half.\r\nIt was by way of compensating for the great cost of parchment that\r\nopisthographic writing was adopted and rolls were put aside; and the\r\nname alone remains as applied to the _rolls_ of procedure. The size that\r\nleaves should assume was also fixed, according to the different uses for\r\nwhich they were intended. For instance, the leaves of parliamentary\r\ndocuments were nine inches and a half long by seven and a half wide;\r\nthose of the council, ten by eight; those of finance and of private\r\ncontracts, twelve and a half by nine and a half; letters of pardon,\r\nunder the king’s hand, were to be on entire skins squared, two feet two\r\ninches by one foot eight inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 332.--The Paper-Maker, drawn and engraved in the\r\nSixteenth Century by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nBut while the use of parchment was still strictly employed in the\r\nchancellor’s offices and the tribunals, where the _basoche_ (a\r\nbrotherhood of lawyers of all grades) considered it as one of their most\r\nlucrative privileges (Fig. 331), it had for a long while ceased to be\r\nused anywhere else. Paper, after having during many centuries competed\r\nwith parchment, at last almost entirely replaced it (Fig. 332); for if\r\nless durable, it had the great advantage of costing much less. Formerly\r\nnothing but the ancient papyrus of Egypt was known, and it was made use\r\nof concurrently with parchment till there was brought into Europe,\r\ntowards the tenth century, cotton paper, which is generally believed to\r\nbe a Chinese invention, and which was at first called _Grecian\r\nparchment_, because the Venetians, who introduced it into the West, had\r\nfound it in use in Greece.\r\n\r\nActually, this paper was at first of a very inferior quality, coarse,\r\nspongy, dull, and subject to the attacks of damp and worms; so much so\r\nthat the Emperor Frederick II. issued, in 1221, an order declaring null\r\nand void all documents written on it, and fixing the term at two years\r\nby which all were to be transcribed on parchment.\r\n\r\nThe use and the knowledge of the process of manufacturing paper from\r\ncotton soon led to the fabrication of paper from linen or rags. It is,\r\nhowever, impossible to say when and where it was accomplished--the\r\nassertions and the testimonies on this point are so contradictory. Some\r\nthink that the paper was brought from the East by the Spanish Saracens;\r\nothers say it came from China; these affirm it has been employed since\r\nthe tenth century; those, that we can only find specimens of it as far\r\nback as the reign of St. Louis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 333.--Water-Marks on Paper, from the Fourteenth to\r\nthe Fifteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the most ancient writing on paper made of rags known at the\r\npresent day is a letter from Joinville to Louis X., dated 1315; we may,\r\nmoreover, mention with certainty, as written on linen paper, an\r\ninventory of goods belonging to a certain Prior Henry, who died in 1340,\r\nwhich is preserved at Canterbury, and many authentic writings, dating\r\nback as far as 1335, preserved in the British Museum, London. The first\r\npaper-manufactory established in England was, it is said, at Hertford,\r\nwhich dates only from 1588; but important paper-manufactories existed in\r\nFrance from the reign of Philippe de Valois, that is, from the middle of\r\nthe fourteenth century; particularly at Essonne and at Troyes. The paper\r\nwhich came from these manufactories bore generally, in the paper itself,\r\ndifferent marks (Fig. 333) called water-marks, such as a bull’s head, a\r\ncross, a serpent, a star, a crown, &c., according to the quality or\r\ndestination of the paper. Many other countries in Europe had also\r\nflourishing paper-manufactories in the fourteenth century. From this\r\nperiod we find, indeed, a large number of documents written on paper\r\nmade of rags, the use of which thus preceded by about a century the\r\ninvention of printing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 334.--Banner of the Paper-Makers of Paris.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUSCRIPTS\r\n\r\n     Manuscripts in Olden Times.--Their Form.--Materials of which they\r\n     were composed.--Their Destruction by the Goths.--Rare at the\r\n     Beginning of the Middle Ages.--The Catholic Church preserved and\r\n     multiplied them.--Copyists.--Transcription of\r\n     Diplomas.--Corporation of Scribes and\r\n     Booksellers.--Palæography.--Greek Writings.--Uncial and Cursive\r\n     Manuscripts.--Sclavonic Writings.--Latin Writers.--Tironian\r\n     Shorthand.--Lombardic\r\n     Characters.--Diplomatic.--Capetian.--Ludovicinian.--Gothic.--Runic.--\r\n     Visigothic.--Anglo-Saxon.--Irish.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet the reader refer to the chapters on PARCHMENT and BINDING, and he\r\nwill find a few remarks on the purely material part of manuscripts; we\r\nmay, then, here treat this question very summarily; and for that purpose\r\nwe shall avail ourselves of the remarkable work of J. J.\r\nChampollion-Figeac.\r\n\r\nWhen writing was once invented, and had passed into general use in\r\ncivilised society, the choice of substances suited for its reception,\r\nand to fix it in a durable manner, was very diversified, although\r\ndepending on the nature of the text to be written.\r\n\r\nPeople wrote on stone, on metals, on the bark and leaves of many kinds\r\nof trees, on dried or baked clay, on wood, on ivory, wax, linen, the\r\nhides of quadrupeds, on parchment, the best of these preparations; on\r\npapyrus, which is the inner bark of a reed growing in the Nile; then on\r\npaper made of cotton; and lastly, on paper made from hemp and flax,\r\ncalled rag paper. The Roman world had adopted the use of papyrus, which\r\nwas a very important branch of commerce at Alexandria. We find proof of\r\nthis in the writers of antiquity: St. Jerome bears witness to it as far\r\nas regards the fifth century of our era. The Latin and Greek emperors\r\ngave their diplomas on papyrus. Popes traced their most ancient bulls\r\nupon it. The charters of the kings of France of the first race were also\r\nissued on papyrus. From the eighth century parchment contended with\r\npapyrus; a little later cotton paper also became its competitor, and the\r\neleventh century is generally fixed on as the period when papyrus was\r\nentirely superseded by the new materials appropriated to the\r\npreservation of writing.\r\n\r\nFor writing on papyrus the brush or reed was employed, with inks of\r\ndifferent colours; black ink was, however, most generally used. There\r\ngrew on the banks of the Nile, at the time when the reed furnished\r\npapyrus, another sort of reed, stiffer and also more flexible, and\r\nadmirably suited for the manufacture of the _calamus_, an instrument\r\nsupplying the place of the pen, which was not adopted before the eighth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe size of manuscripts was in no way subject to fixed rules, there were\r\nvolumes of all dimensions; the most ancient on parchment are, in\r\ngeneral, longer than they are broad, or else are square; the writing\r\nrests on a line traced with the dry point of the _calamus_, and\r\nafterwards with black-lead; the parts making up a volume are composed of\r\nan indeterminate number of leaves; a word or a figure, placed at the\r\nbottom of the last page of each part and at the end of the volume,\r\nserves as a _catchword_ from one fasciculus to another.\r\n\r\nThe emperors of Constantinople used to sign in red ink the acts of their\r\nsovereignty; their first secretary was the guardian of the vase\r\ncontaining the cinnabar (vermilion), which the emperor alone might use.\r\nSome diplomas of the kings of France of the second race are signed in\r\nthe same manner. In valuable manuscripts, great use was made of golden\r\nink, especially when the parchment was dyed purple; but red ink was\r\nalmost always employed for capital letters or for the titles of books,\r\nand for a long time after the invention of printing the volumes still\r\nhad the _rubrics_ (_ruber_, red) painted or beautifully executed with\r\nthe pen.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of rich manuscripts, even when they contained the\r\ntext of some ancient secular author, were destined to be presented to\r\nthe treasuries of churches and abbeys, and these offerings were not made\r\nwithout great display: the book, whatever its contents might be, was\r\nplaced on the altar, and a solemn mass was celebrated on the occasion;\r\nmoreover, an inscription at the end of the work mentioned the homage\r\nwhich had been paid for it to God and to the saints in paradise.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget that in this time of almost universal ignorance, the\r\nChurch was the only depository of literature and science; she sought\r\nafter those heathen authors who could instruct her in eloquence that\r\nmight be employed in advancing the faith, almost as much as she sought\r\nfor sacred books; it was not rare even to see Christian zeal exalting\r\nitself so far as to find prophets of the Messiah in writers very\r\nanterior to the doctrines of Christ. Thus the best Greek and Latin\r\nmanuscripts of profane authors are the work of monks, as were the Bibles\r\nand the writings of the Fathers of the Church. The rules of the most\r\nancient brotherhoods recommended the monks who could write and who\r\nwished to please God to re-copy the manuscripts, and those who were\r\nilliterate to learn to bind them. “The work of the copyist,” said the\r\nlearned Alcuin to his contemporaries, “is a meritorious work, which is\r\nprofitable to the soul, while the work of the ploughman is profitable\r\nonly to the belly.”\r\n\r\nAt all periods of history we find mention made of certain celebrated\r\nmanuscripts. We will not go so far back as the Greek traditions relating\r\nto the works of Homer, of which some copies were ornamented with a\r\nrichness that has, probably, never been surpassed. In the fifth century\r\nSt. Jerome possessed twenty-five parts of the works of Origen, which\r\nPamphilus the Martyr had copied with his own hand. St. Ambrose, St.\r\nFulgentius, Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims, men as learned as they were\r\npious, applied themselves to reproducing with their own hands the best\r\nancient texts. A copyist by profession was called _scriba_, _scriptor_;\r\nthe place in which they generally worked was called _scriptorium_. The\r\ncapitularies against bad copyists were frequently renewed. “We ordain\r\nthat no scribe write incorrectly,” we find in the collection of Baluze.\r\nWe read in the same collection, in 789, “There shall be good Catholic\r\ntexts in all monasteries, so that prayers shall not be made to God in\r\nfaulty language.” In 805, “If the Gospels, the Psalter, or the Missal\r\nare to be copied, only careful middle-aged men are to be employed;\r\nverbal errors may otherwise be introduced into the faith.” There were,\r\nmoreover, _correctors_ who rectified the work of the copyists, and\r\nattested the work, on the volumes, by the words _contuli_, _emendavi_\r\n(“I have collated, I have revised”). A copy of Origen’s works has been\r\nmentioned, corrected by the hand of Charlemagne himself, to whom is also\r\nattributed the introduction of full stops and commas.\r\n\r\nThe same care presided over the preparation of royal charters and\r\ndiplomas; the referendaries or chancellors drew them up and\r\nsuperintended their despatch; the principal officers of the crown\r\nintervened, as guarantors or witnesses to them, and these acts were read\r\npublicly before they were signed and sealed. Notaries and witnesses\r\nguaranteed the authenticity of private charters.\r\n\r\nAs long as printing did not exist in France, the corporation of scribes,\r\ncopyists of charters, and copyists of manuscripts, which counted among\r\nthem booksellers, was very numerous and very influential, since it was\r\ncomposed of graduates of the university that patronised them and placed\r\nthem among the number of its indispensable agents. He who desired to\r\nbecome a bookseller had to give proof of his instruction and of his\r\nability; he was obliged to take an oath “not to commit any deception,\r\nfraud, or evil thing which might damage or prejudice the university, its\r\nscholars and frequenters, nor to rob nor speak ill of them.” Besides\r\nwhich he was compelled to deposit a sum of fifty francs (_livres\r\nparisis_) as caution-money.\r\n\r\nThe rules imposed on scribes and on booksellers were always very strict,\r\nand this severity was only too justly occasioned by the abuses that\r\nexisted, and by the scandalous disorder of the people who exercised\r\nthese professions. In the year 1324 the university published this\r\norder:--“There will be admitted only people of good conduct and morals,\r\nsufficiently acquainted with the book trade, and previously approved by\r\nthe university. The bookseller may not take a clerk into his service\r\ntill that clerk has sworn, before the university, to exercise his\r\nprofession according to the ordinances. The bookseller must give to the\r\nuniversity a list of the works which he sells; he must not refuse to let\r\na manuscript to whomsoever may wish to make a copy of it, on payment of\r\nthe indemnity fixed by the university. He is forbidden to let out books\r\nthat have not been corrected, and those students who find an incorrect\r\ncopy are requested to denounce it publicly to the rector, so that the\r\nbookseller who has let it out may be punished, and that the copy may be\r\ncorrected by _scholares_ (learned men or scholars). There shall be every\r\nyear four commissioners chosen to fix the price of books. One bookseller\r\nshall not sell a work to another bookseller before he has exposed the\r\nwork for sale during four days. In any case the seller is obliged to\r\nregister the name of the purchaser, to describe him, and to state the\r\nprice for which the book was sold.”\r\n\r\nFrom century to century this legislation underwent variations, according\r\nto the ideas of the times: and when the printing-press came, in the\r\nmiddle of the fifteenth century, to change the face of the world, the\r\ncorporation of _scribes_ rose at first against the new art which was to\r\nruin them. “But at last,” says Champollion-Figeac, “they submitted, and\r\ntemporary measures were recommended to the public authorities for the\r\ndefence of an ancient order of things which could not long resist the\r\nnew.”\r\n\r\nNow let us go back to the first centuries of the Middle Ages, to resume\r\nthe question from a palæographic point of view.\r\n\r\nThe languages and literature of modern Europe are all Greek or Latin,\r\nSclavonic or Gothic; these four great families of peoples and of\r\nlanguages have existed in spite of the vicissitudes of politics. Such is\r\nthe basis whereon must be found all the researches by which we are to\r\nestablish the origin and nature of the writing peculiar to each\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks of Constantinople taught writing to the Sclavonic race, and\r\nwith it the Christian faith. The most ancient Greek writing (we speak of\r\nthe Christian era only) was the _capital_ writing, regular and\r\nwell-proportioned; as it became general it was simplified more and more.\r\nAfter this sort of writing, examples of which are found only on stone or\r\nbronze, we come to the writing called, although we do not know why,\r\n_uncial_,[53] which, was the first step towards the Greek _cursive_\r\n(flowing).\r\n\r\n_Uncial_ writing was employed, in Greek manuscripts, up to the ninth\r\ncentury; we may observe the transition from the _uncial_ to the\r\n_half-uncial_, and from the _half-uncial_ to the _minuscule_.[54] In the\r\ntenth century manuscripts in minuscule became very abundant--the\r\ntachygrapher’s (ταχὑς, quick, and γρἁφω, I write), or the partisans of\r\nquick writing, gained the day; the caligraphers (καλὁς, beautiful, and\r\nγρἁφω I write) desired to follow their example. These employed a great\r\ndeal of time in painting the initials of running letters: the new\r\nmethod, which produced more in the same space of time, easily got into\r\nfavour; the caligraphers abandoned the uncial and adopted the minuscule\r\ncharacters connected together, which combined good forms with greater\r\nfacility of execution. Thenceforward, the uncial was no longer employed\r\nexcept for the titles or headings of books.\r\n\r\nAmong the fine specimens of this epoch which have been preserved, we may\r\nmention, in the Imperial Library of Paris, a Book of the Gospels, called\r\nCardinal Mazarin’s, and the Commentaries of Gregory Nazianzus; at the\r\nLaurentinean Library, Florence, are a Plutarch and a Book of the\r\nGospels, written with gold ink in large and massive minuscule cursive\r\ncharacters; and lastly, a book of ecclesiastical offices, belonging also\r\nto the Imperial Library in Paris, and which bears this superscription in\r\nGreek:--“Pray for Euthymus, a poor monk, priest of the monastery of St.\r\nLazare. This volume was finished in the month of May, Convocation S, in\r\nthe year 6515,” a date which, according to the computation of the Greek\r\nChurch, corresponds to the month of May of the year 1007 of the\r\nChristian era.\r\n\r\nTo the twelfth century is assigned the beautiful Greek manuscript which\r\nwas afterwards given to Louis XIV. by Chrysanthes Noras, Patriarch of\r\nJerusalem; to the thirteenth century belongs another manuscript, in very\r\nsmall cursive letters, ornamented with portraits, presented by the\r\nEmperor Palæologos to St. Louis. It was only in the fourteenth century\r\nthat manuscripts half Latin and half Greek, appeared. Lastly came Ange\r\nVégèce, of Corfu, who, towards the middle of the fifteenth century, made\r\nfor himself, as a Greek caligrapher, such a reputation that he gave, it\r\nis said, rise to the proverb, “_Écrire comme un ange_.”\r\n\r\nThe Greek alphabet, when it penetrated into the countries of the north\r\nwith the Christian religion and civilisation, underwent important\r\nmodifications. On the right bank of the Danube, in ancient Mœsia,\r\nUlphilas, the descendant of a Cappadocian family formerly taken prisoner\r\nby the Goths, invented, in the fourth century, the alphabet bearing, on\r\nthat account, the name of _Mœso-Gothic_, and which is of Greek origin,\r\nwith a mixture of Latin characters and other peculiar signs. This\r\nwriting is heavy, without being elegant; differing, as if by an instinct\r\nof nationality, from the types which it imitates. The Mœso-Gothic\r\nmanuscripts are, however, very rare; only two or three being known.\r\n\r\nThe Sclavonic writing, which is also a daughter of Greece, has a history\r\nnearly similar to that of the Mœso-Gothic. When the people of this\r\nfamily were converted to Christianity, they were brought over to it by\r\nGreek Christians, and the Patriarch Cyril, in the ninth century, became\r\ntheir teacher; he taught them, how to write (which they never knew till\r\nthen), and it was the Greek alphabet they adopted, adding to it,\r\nhowever, a few new signs, so that they might be able to express the\r\nsounds peculiar to their language. Sclavonic manuscripts are positively\r\nnumerous in public libraries. We find them in Paris, Bologna, and Rome,\r\nbut above all in Germany, and in the country under the dominion of the\r\nMuscovite. One of the most celebrated is that belonging to the town of\r\nRheims, and which is known by the name of “Texte du Sacre,” because a\r\ntradition (an erroneous one, however) asserts that the kings of France,\r\nat the time of their coronation at Rheims, took the oaths on this book,\r\nwhich was said to be written by the hand of St. Procopius. The Sclavonic\r\nmanuscripts in general recommend themselves less by the elegance of\r\ntheir execution than by the richness of their bindings.\r\n\r\nThe actual Russian alphabet is but an abridgment of the alphabet called\r\nthe _Cyrilian_, reduced to forty-two signs by the Emperor Peter I.; so\r\nthat the Sclavonic nations knew two _Cyrilian_ alphabets, the ancient\r\nSclavonic for the liturgical writings, and the modern Sclavonic, or\r\nRussian, in general use. Of the first no manuscripts exist earlier than\r\nthe eleventh century of our era.\r\n\r\nThe manuscripts of the Latins are, without doubt, more numerous and more\r\nvaried, because the Latin Church is more extensive, and because Roman\r\ncivilisation spread itself over a larger number of European provinces.\r\nAt the head of the manuscripts of the Latin writing is placed a fragment\r\nof papyrus, found in Egypt, on which is inscribed an imperial edict for\r\nthe annulment of a sale of property, agreed upon in consequence of some\r\nviolence committed by a certain man named Isidore; the date of this\r\ndocument has been fixed as the third century. For the fourth century we\r\nhave the “Virgil,” with miniatures, which we mention elsewhere\r\n(MINIATURES OF MANUSCRIPTS), and a “Terence,” both belonging to the\r\nVatican Library, and both written in capital letters; in the latter,\r\nhowever, they are irregular, and called, on that account, _rustic\r\ncapitals_.\r\n\r\nTo the same period we must refer the “Treatise on the Republic,” by\r\nCicero, which has but lately been found in a volume from which the\r\nprevious writing had been effaced, as was often the case (see PARCHMENT\r\nAND PAPER), in order to make room for the new writing. For the fifth\r\ncentury we have a second “Virgil,” with miniatures, which passed from\r\nthe library of the Abbey of St. Denis into that of the Vatican. The\r\n“Prudence,” which the Imperial Library of Paris still possesses, is a\r\nvery fine manuscript of the sixth century, written, in rustic capitals,\r\nquaint but elegant.\r\n\r\nTwo other kinds of writing were, at the same period, in use among the\r\nLatins; this same rustic capital, ceasing to be rectangular, and rounded\r\nin its principal strokes, became the uncial; and for that very reason\r\nbeing much more expeditious, was reserved especially for the copying of\r\nworks; while the cursive, although sometimes employed for manuscripts,\r\nwas used chiefly in letter-writing. Of the first of these two writings,\r\nthe uncial, we have two fine specimens of the sixth century in the\r\n“Sermons” of St. Augustine, on papyrus (Fig. 336), and in a Psalter of\r\nSt. Germain-des-Prés, written in letters of silver on purple vellum,\r\nboth of which now belong to the Imperial Library, Paris.\r\n\r\nIn the same century, we find a kind of writing called _half-uncial_,\r\nwhich became more and more expeditious by the change made in certain of\r\nits forms. There was then also a Gallican uncial, the form of which we\r\ncan see in the manuscript said to be by St. Prosper (Imperial Library,\r\nParis); and an uncial of Italy, among which figure the Bible of\r\nMont-Amiati, at Florence; the palimpsest[55] Homilies of the Vatican,\r\nand the admirable Book of the Gospels at Notre-Dame, Paris (Fig. 337).\r\n\r\nThe most ancient style of cursive writing, employed in charts and\r\ndiplomas, is to be seen in the deeds known by the name of _charters of\r\nRavenna_, from the name of the town in which they were first discovered.\r\nWe may consider as analogous to these the writing of the Acts of our\r\nearly kings, very difficult to read on account of the exaggerated manner\r\nin which the thin strokes join the letters together, and by the\r\nindefinite forms of the up and down strokes. We give a fragment (Fig.\r\n338) taken from an original chart, on parchment, of Childebert III. We\r\nsee what the same writing had become in 784 by Fig. 339, copied from an\r\noriginal capitulary of Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nTo the same period belongs the employment, in ordinary use among\r\nchancellors and notaries, of a writing completely tachygraphic; it is\r\ncomposed of ciphers, one of which took the place of a syllable or a\r\nword. This writing was called _Tironian_, because the invention of it is\r\nattributed to Tiro, Cicero’s freed-man, who made use of it in\r\ntachygraphing, or, as we should now say, stenographing (short-hand), the\r\nspeeches of the illustrious orator. Fig. 340 is taken from a psalter of\r\nthe eighth century, of which the text is transcribed with the\r\ntachygraphic characters of that period.\r\n\r\nThe name of _Visigothic_ is given to the writing of manuscripts executed\r\nin the south of France and in Spain during the rule of the Goths and the\r\nVisigoths; this writing, still rather Roman, is generally round and\r\nembellished with fanciful strokes, which render it agreeable to the eye.\r\n\r\nWe also find in Italy the _Lombardic_, in use for diplomas till the\r\ntwelfth century.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful manuscripts on purple vellum are of the time of\r\nCharlemagne, when luxury in the arts showed itself in all forms. There\r\nis in the Imperial Library, Paris, a magnificent volume, which came from\r\nthe ancient domain of Soubise, that contains the Epistles and Gospels\r\nfor all the festivals of the year: the execution of this work is\r\nperfect; the gigantic capital letters, of Anglo-Saxon form, are\r\ncoloured, and rendered still richer by being dotted with gold.\r\n\r\nA valuable manuscript of the “Tractus Temporum” of the Venerable Bede, a\r\nmanuscript posterior by more than two hundred years to the author, who\r\nlived in the beginning of the eighth century, affords a specimen of one\r\nof the varieties of minuscule writings, which in France was called the\r\n_Lombardic writing of books_, because it was in use during the reign of\r\nthe Lombard kings beyond the Alps; it is more difficult to read than the\r\nRoman, though similar in form, because the words are not separated. A\r\nbeautiful manuscript of “Horace” (Imperial Library, Paris), which\r\npresents a mixture of the different kinds of Roman writing of the\r\nperiod, is attributed to the same century. We have in Fig. 341 an\r\nelegant ornamental capital, taken from a manuscript, “Commentaries of\r\nSt. Jerome,” also in the Imperial Library. We find specimens of writing\r\nof Anglo-Saxon origin, capital letters, and running text, in many books\r\nof the Gospel.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic writing of the tenth century is here represented by a\r\ncharter of the king, Hugh Capet, from which we borrow Fig. 342; it must\r\nhave been issued between 988 and 996. In this fragment, the first line\r\nonly is composed of characters very elongated, close together, mixed\r\nwith some capital letters and some singular forms. It bears witness to\r\nthe fact that the fine Merovingian writing had then singularly\r\ndegenerated.\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh century the minuscule of manuscripts was characterised\r\nby its angular forms, which caused it to receive the name of _Capetian_.\r\nThen the Capetian, exaggerated in its tendency towards its strokes and\r\nangles, became the _Ludovician_, which announces the thirteenth century,\r\nand characterises the reign of St. Louis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 335.--Scribe or Copyist, in his Work-room,\r\nsurrounded by Open Manuscripts, and Writing at a Desk.\r\n\r\n(From a Miniature of the Fifteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nHowever, manuscripts of the thirteenth century abound, and the history\r\nof the writing of the period of St. Louis and of the three centuries\r\nsucceeding it, may be summed up in these words:--“The Capetian writing\r\ncalled _Ludovician_, when it had come to differ still more from the\r\nbeautiful forms of the writings of Charlemagne’s time or the renovated\r\nRoman, was more and more deformed, and these successive degradations\r\nbecame so complicated that the writing, in the seventeenth century,\r\nresulted in being perfectly illegible. Thus can be generalised all the\r\nprecepts relative to the state of writing, in the manuscripts and the\r\ncharters in France, for this period of three hundred years” (Fig. 343).\r\n\r\nIt was, however, the era of the richest manuscripts, that in which was\r\nbrought to perfection the art of ornamenting them, when the pencil of\r\nthe miniature-painter and the pen of the caligrapher, conjointly,\r\nproduced some masterpieces (Fig. 344). This was also the time when the\r\ncorporation of writers became numerous and powerful (Fig. 335). One of\r\nthe most distinguished members of this society was that Nicholas Flamel,\r\nabout whom so many fabulous legends have been invented. We give, as a\r\nspecimen of his magnificent cursive writing (Fig. 345), the fac-simile\r\nof one of the _ex libris_ inscriptions he placed at the beginning of all\r\nthe books belonging to Duke Jean de Berry, whose secretary and\r\n_bookseller_ he was.[56]\r\n\r\nIn other countries than France, in Germany especially, Gothic writing\r\nwas easily diffused. German manuscripts differ little from those of\r\nFrance. We observe only that German writing continued to be very fine\r\ntill the middle of the thirteenth century, at which period it became\r\nirregular, angular, and bristling with sharp points.\r\n\r\nThat which has just been said of Germany in particular is naturally\r\napplicable to East and West Flanders, and to the Low Countries. During\r\nthe fifteenth century, under the impulse given by the Dukes of Burgundy,\r\nwhose influence we have already mentioned, the most important\r\nchronicles, the best histories then extant, were magnificently\r\ntranscribed in that beautiful Gothic minuscule, thick, massive and\r\nangular, which was called _lettre de forme_; and we find it again in\r\nsome ancient editions of the end of the fifteenth century (Fig. 346),\r\nand of the beginning of the sixteenth.\r\n\r\nIn more northern countries the _Runic_ alphabet was made use of, to\r\nwhich for a long while a marvellous origin was attributed, but which the\r\nBenedictines justly regarded as an imitation, or rather as a corruption,\r\nof the Latin alphabet. There exist in the _Runic_ language inscriptions\r\non stone and on wood, some manuscripts on vellum, and Irish books on\r\nparchment and on paper.\r\n\r\nIn the south, the writing seems constantly to have reflected the lively\r\nand frank spirit of its inhabitants, among whom was perpetuated the\r\nprofound impress of the old Roman civilisation. The minuscule continued\r\nas high as it was long, thin, and distinct; even when it was altered by\r\nthe influence of the Gothic, it was still beautiful, and, above all,\r\nlegible, as we may be convinced of by examining a fine manuscript\r\nentitled “Specchio della Croce” (“Mirror of the Cross”), of the\r\nthirteenth century; and a precious manuscript of Dante, of the\r\nfourteenth century, both belonging to the Imperial Library, Paris.\r\n\r\nWe may adopt for Spain the same opinions as for Italy. There was in\r\nthat country also writing of great merit, handed down from the Romans,\r\nwhich received, as we have already said, the name of _Visigothic_. The\r\nVisigothic writing of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, of the\r\neleventh especially, is a minuscule of the most graceful kind. But\r\nGothicism, by the _Capetian_ and the _Ludovician_ coming in as\r\nintermediate agents, at last corrupted this elegant and delicate\r\nwriting, as we see in the collection of Spanish troubadours, formed by\r\norder of John II., King of Castile and Leon, about 1440; a celebrated\r\nmanuscript in the Imperial Library, Paris.\r\n\r\nInto England, where the Anglo-Saxon type reigned supreme, the Norman\r\nconquest introduced the French writing in charters and manuscripts. And\r\nlastly, among the writings called national, we must again mention that\r\nof Ireland, of which there are fine examples remaining; but upon\r\nexamination they prove to be nothing but a variety of the Anglo-Saxon.\r\nIt is said to have been in use since the sixth century; and we find that\r\nin spite of divers conquests it continued to be employed till the\r\nfifteenth century. It was even known and employed in France, although it\r\nby no means recommends itself by its elegance, as is attested, among\r\nother manuscripts, by that of the “Homilies of St. Augustine,” in the\r\nImperial Library, Paris, which is supposed to belong to the eighth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nHere our summary review of palæographic examples at different periods of\r\nthe Middle Ages comes to an end. We might follow up our investigations\r\non this point, even after the time when the printing-press was invented,\r\nsince manuscripts are found of the reign of Louis XIV.; but they were\r\nnothing but fanciful inutilities; each century, in order to show itself\r\nin its true light, should follow the instincts and the inspirations\r\nwhich belong to it.\r\n\r\nFAC-SIMILE OF MANUSCRIPTS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 336.--Writing of the Sixth Century, with Capital\r\nLetters, from a Manuscript, on Papyrus, of the “Sermons of St.\r\nAugustine.”\r\n\r\n(Imperial Library, Paris.)\r\n\r\nTEXT.--_Spes nostra e[st] non de isto tempore, neque de mundo est, neque\r\nin ea felicita[te...._\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION.--Our hope is not of this time, nor is it of the world, nor\r\nin that felicity.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 337.--Title and Capital Letters of the Seventh\r\nCentury, from a Book of the Gospels of Notre-Dame, Paris.

Our intention is not to go back to the sources--as\r\nobscure as they are distant--of that art, but only to point out its\r\nprincipal phases of improvement or of decay during the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient known miniatures date from the very commencement of\r\nthat period which is generally called the Middle Ages; that is to say,\r\nfrom the third and fourth centuries. These paintings, of which there\r\nexist but two or three specimens in the libraries of Europe,\r\nnevertheless offer, in their correctness and masterly beauty, the great\r\ncharacteristics of ancient Art. The most celebrated are those of the\r\n“Virgil,” preserved in the Vatican Library (Fig. 348), a manuscript long\r\ncelebrated among learned men for the authenticity of its text. Another\r\n“Virgil,” of the date of about a century later, and which, before its\r\npresentation to the Pope, was one of the most beautiful ornaments of the\r\nancient library of the Abbey of St. Denis, in France, contains paintings\r\nnot less remarkable in respect of colour, but very inferior as far as\r\ndrawing and the style of the compositions are concerned. These two\r\nincomparable examples are sufficient in themselves to show the state of\r\nthe painting of manuscripts at the beginning of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 348.--Miniature taken from the “Virgil” in the\r\nLibrary of the Vatican, Rome.\r\n\r\n(Third or Fourth Century.)]\r\n\r\nThe sixth and seventh centuries have left us no books with miniatures;\r\nthe utmost we find at that period are some capital letters embellished\r\nby caligraphy. In the eighth century, on the contrary, the ornaments\r\nwere multiplied, and some rather elegant paintings can be pointed out;\r\nthe fact is, under the reign of Charlemagne a movement of renovation\r\ntook place in the Arts as in literature: the Latin writing, which had\r\nbecome illegible, was reformed, and the style of painting manuscripts\r\nassumed something of the form of the fine antique examples still extant\r\nat that period. (Fig. 350.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 349.--Painted Capital letters, taken from\r\nManuscripts of the Eighth or Ninth Century.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 350.--Border, taken from a Book of the Gospels of\r\nthe Eighth Century. (Library of Vienna).]\r\n\r\nIf we would have an idea of the heaviness and the ungraceful character\r\nof the writing and of the ornaments which accompanied it before the\r\nperiod of Charlemagne, it will suffice to examine Fig. 349. “It was then\r\nquite time,” says M. Aimé Champollion-Figeac, “that the salutary\r\ninfluence exercised by the illustrious monarch made itself felt in the\r\nArts as well as in letters.” The first manuscripts which seem to bear\r\nwitness to this progress are first a sacramentary, said to be that of\r\nGellonius, the allegorical paintings of which are of great interest in\r\nthe history of Christian symbolism; and a Book of the Gospels, now in\r\nthe Louvre: the latter is said to have belonged to the great emperor\r\nhimself, and we reproduce one of the paintings from it (Fig. 351). We\r\nmay mention, as of the ninth century, many Books of the Gospels, in one\r\nof which, given by Louis le Débonnaire to the Abbey St. Médard de\r\nSoissons, the purest Byzantine style shows itself; then the Bible called\r\nthe “Metz” Bible, in which are paintings of large dimensions, remarkable\r\nfor the felicitous groupings of the figures and for the beauty of the\r\ndraperies. One of these miniatures excites an interest quite peculiar,\r\ninasmuch as King David, who is represented in it, is but a copy of an\r\nancient Apollo, round whom the artist has personified Courage, Justice,\r\nPrudence, &c.\r\n\r\nLet us mention still further two Bibles and a book of prayers, the last\r\ncontaining a very fine portrait of the king, Charles the Bald, to whom\r\nit belonged; and lastly, two books really worth attention, on account of\r\nthe delicacy and freedom of the outline drawings, for the attitudes of\r\nthe characters represented, and for the draperies, which resemble those\r\nof ancient statues. These books are a “Terence,” preserved in the\r\nImperial Library, Paris, number 7,899 in the catalogue; and a\r\n“Lectionary of the Cathedal of Metz,” from which the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 351.--Miniature from the Book of the Gospels of\r\nCharlemagne.\r\n\r\n(Manuscript in the Library of the Louvre.)]\r\n\r\nborder (Fig. 352) is taken. While in France the art of painting\r\nmanuscripts had progressed so much as to produce some perfect models of\r\ndelicacy and taste, Germany had never got beyond the simplest\r\ncompositions, as we see in the “Paraphrase on the Gospels,” in Theotisc\r\n(the old Teutonic language), belonging to the Library of Vienna.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 352.--Border of a Lectionary in the Cathedral of\r\nMetz. (Ninth Century.)]\r\n\r\nThe artistic traditions of the ancients in the ninth century are\r\nattested by the manuscripts of Christian Greece, whereof the Imperial\r\nLibrary, Paris, possesses many magnificent specimens, at the head of\r\nwhich we must place the “Commentaries of Gregory Nazianzus,” ornamented\r\nwith an infinite number of paintings, in which all the resources of\r\nancient art are applied to the representation of Christian subjects\r\n(Fig. 353). The heads of the characters portrayed are admirably\r\nexpressive, and of the finest style; the colouring of the miniatures is\r\nwarm and soft; the costumes, the representations of buildings and of the\r\naccessories, offer, moreover, very interesting subjects of study.\r\nUnfortunately, these paintings were executed on a very crumbling\r\nsurface, which has in many places peeled off: it is sad to see one of\r\nthe most precious monuments of Greek and Christian Art in a deplorable\r\nstate of dilapidation.\r\n\r\nThe masterpiece of the tenth century, which again is due to the artists\r\nof Greece, is a “Psalter, with Commentaries,” belonging also to the\r\nImperial Library (number 139 among the Greek manuscripts), a work in\r\nwhich the miniature-painter seems not to have been able to disengage\r\nhimself from the Pagan creeds in illustrating Biblical episodes. Two\r\ncelebrated manuscripts of the same time, but executed in France, and\r\npreserved in the same collection, show, by the stiffness and\r\nincorrectness of the drawing, that the impetus given by the genius of\r\nCharlemagne had abated: these are the “Bible de Noailles,” and the\r\n“Bible de St. Martial,” of Limoges (Fig. 355).\r\n\r\nTo speak truly, if in France there was a decadency, the Anglo-Saxon and\r\nVisigothic artists of this period\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 353.--Miniature of the Ninth Century, extracted from\r\nthe “Commentaries of Gregory Nazianzus,” representing the consecration\r\nof a Bishop. (Large folio Manuscript in the Imperial Library, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nwere also very inferior, to judge from a Latin Book of the Gospels of\r\nthe tenth century painted in England (Fig. 356); it, however, proves\r\nthat the art of ornamenting books had degenerated less than that of\r\ndrawing the human figure. Another manuscript with paintings, called\r\nVisigothic, containing the Apocalypse of St. John, gives, in its\r\nfantastic ornaments and animals, an example of the strange style adopted\r\nby a certain school of miniature-painters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 354.--Fac-smile of a Miniature drawn with the pen,\r\ntaken from a Bible of the Eleventh Century. (Imperial Library, Paris.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 355.--Border taken from the Bible of St. Martial of\r\nLimoges. (Tenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nGermany now began to improve in the art of painting miniatures. It owed\r\nthis happy result to the emigration of Greek artists, who came to the\r\nGerman court to take refuge from the troubles of the East. The progress\r\naccomplished in this part of Europe shows itself in the drawing of the\r\nfigures of a German Book of the Gospels of the beginning of the eleventh\r\ncentury, a work very superior to that of the Teutonic Book of the\r\nGospels just referred to. The border of which we give a fac-simile in\r\nFig. 357 shows also a certain degree of improvement; it is taken from a\r\nBook of the Gospels of the same period, preserved in the Royal Library,\r\nMunich.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 356.--Border taken from a Book of the Gospels in\r\nLatin, executed in England. (Tenth Century.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 357.--Border taken from a Book of the Gospels of the\r\nbeginning of the Eleventh Century. In the Royal Library, Munich.]\r\n\r\nBut in France, to foreign invasions and to misfortunes of all kinds,\r\nwhich, since the death of Charlemagne, had afflicted the country, was\r\nadded the terror caused by the general expectation that the world was\r\ncoming to an end at the expiration of the first millennial. People were,\r\ntherefore, otherwise employed than in ornamenting books. Accordingly,\r\nthis epoch is one of the most barren in religious or other paintings.\r\nFig. 358 represents the last degree of abasement in this art. Nothing in\r\nthe world could be more barbarous, nor farther removed from all\r\nsentiment of the beautiful, and even from the instinctive idea of\r\ndrawing. Ornamentation, however, remained sufficiently good, although\r\nunder very heavy forms, as the Sacramentary of Æthelgar, which is\r\npreserved in the Library of Rouen, shows (Fig. 359). The decadency,\r\nhowever, seems to have come to a stop in France towards the end of the\r\neleventh century, if we judge of the art from paintings, executed in\r\n1060, and contained in a Latin manuscript, bearing the number 818, in\r\nthe Imperial Library.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 358.--Miniature taken from a Missal of the Beginning\r\nof the Eleventh Century.\r\n\r\n(Imperial Library, Paris, No. 821.)]\r\n\r\nIn the manuscripts of the twelfth century, the influence of the Crusades\r\nmade itself already felt. At this period, the East regenerated in some\r\nsort the West in all that concerned arts, sciences, and literature. Many\r\nexamples witness that the painting of manuscripts was not the last to\r\nundergo this singular transformation. Everything the imagination could\r\ninvent of the most fantastic was particularly brought into play to give\r\nto the Latin letters a peculiar character--imitated, moreover, from the\r\nornaments of Saracenic architecture. This practice was even applied to\r\npublic acts and documents, as Fig. 360 proves; it represents some of the\r\ninitial letters in the “Rouleau Mortuaire” of St. Vital. Callot, in his\r\n“Temptation of St. Anthony,” has, we think, imagined nothing stranger\r\nthan the figure we give; a demon standing on the back of Cerberus forms\r\nthe vertical line in the letter T; while two other demons, whose feet\r\nare in the mouth of the first, form the two lateral branches of the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 359.--Border taken from the Sacramentary of\r\nÆthelgar. (Rouen Library.)]\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, Saracenic or Gothic art universally\r\nprevailed. Everywhere figures assumed gaunt, elongated forms;\r\ncoats-of-arms invaded the miniatures; but the colouring was of\r\nmarvellous purity and brightness; burnished gold, applied with the\r\ngreatest skill, stood out from blue or purple backgrounds which even in\r\nour own day have lost nothing of their original freshness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 360.--Initial Letters extracted from the “Rouleau\r\nMortuaire” of St. Vital, Twelfth Century.\r\n\r\n(Imperial Archives of France.)]\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable manuscripts of this century we must mention a\r\nPsalter in five colours, containing the French, Hebrew, and Roman\r\nversions, with some commentaries (Imperial Library, No. 1,132 _bis_).\r\nOne should analyse the greater number of subjects depicted in this\r\nmanuscript to understand all their importance; we will mention only that\r\namong them are sieges of towns, Gothic fortresses, interiors of Italian\r\nbanking-houses, various musical instruments, &c. There is, perhaps, no\r\nother manuscript which equals this in the richness, the beauty, and\r\nmultiplicity of its paintings: it contains ninety-nine large miniatures,\r\nindependently of ninety-six\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 361.--Facsimile of a Miniature of a Psalter, of the\r\nThirteenth Century, representing warlike, scientific, commercial, and\r\nagricultural Works. (Imperial Library, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nmedallions representing divers episodes suggested by the text of the\r\nPsalms (Fig. 361). After this psalter we must place the Breviary of St.\r\nLouis, or rather of Queen Blanche, formerly preserved in the Arsenal\r\nLibrary, Paris, and now in the Musée des Souverains; a celebrated\r\nmanuscript which has, on folio 191, this inscription: “C’est le Psautier\r\nmonseigneur St. Loys, lequel fu à sa mère.”[57] But the volume is not\r\nrich in large miniatures. We observe in it, however, a calendar\r\nornamented with small subjects very delicately executed, representing\r\nthe labours appropriate to each month, according to the seasons of the\r\nyear. The character of the paintings exhibits a style anterior to the\r\nreign of Louis IX.; and it is supposed, indeed, that this book first\r\nbelonged to the mother of that king.\r\n\r\nWe must now mention another Psalter, which was actually used by St.\r\nLouis; as is proved not only by an inscription at the beginning of the\r\nvolume, but still further by the fleurs-de-lis of the king, the arms of\r\nBlanche of Castile, his mother, and perhaps also _les pals de gueules_\r\nof Margaret of Provence, his wife. Nothing can equal the beautiful\r\npreservation of the miniatures in this volume, which contains\r\nseventy-eight subjects, with as many explanatory texts in French. The\r\nheads of the characters, though almost microscopic, have nevertheless,\r\ngenerally, a fine expression.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 362.--A Border taken from a Gospel in Latin, of the\r\nThirteenth Century.\r\n\r\n(Imperial Library, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nThe “Livre de Clergie,” which bears the date of 1260, merits far less\r\nattention: so does the “Roman du Roi Artus,” No. 6,963, in the Imperial\r\nLibrary, Paris, executed in 1276. But we must point out two of the most\r\nbeautiful examples of this period, a Book of the Gospels in Latin, No.\r\n665 in the Supplement, Imperial Library, from which we have borrowed an\r\nelegant border (Fig. 362), and the “Roman du Saint-Graal,” No. 6,769,\r\nalso in the Imperial Library.\r\n\r\nItaly was then at the head of civilisation in everything; it had\r\nparticularly inherited the grand traditions of painting which had gone\r\nto sleep for ever in Greece only to wake up again in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 363.--Facsimile of a Miniature of the Thirteenth\r\nCentury, representing a scene of an old Romance: the beautiful Josiane,\r\ndisguised as a female juggler, playing a Welsh air on the _Rote_\r\n(Fiddle), to make herself known to her friend Bewis. (Imperial Library,\r\nParis.)]\r\n\r\nHere we must introduce a remark, the result of a general examination of\r\nthe manuscripts bequeathed to us by the thirteenth century; namely, that\r\nthe miniatures in sacred books are much more beautifully and carefully\r\nexecuted than those of the romances of chivalry and the chronicles of\r\nthe same period (Figs. 363 and 364). Must we attribute this superiority\r\nto the power of religious inspiration? Must we suppose that in the\r\nmonasteries alone clever artists met with sufficient remuneration?\r\nBefore answering these questions, or rather as an answer to them, let us\r\nremember that in those days religious institutions absorbed nearly all\r\nthe social intellectual movement, as well as the effective possession of\r\nmaterial riches, if not of territorial property. Solely occupied with\r\ndistant wars or intestine quarrels which impoverished them, the nobles\r\nwere altogether unable to become protectors of literature and Art. In\r\nthe abbeys and convents were lay-brethren who sometimes had taken no\r\nvow, but whose fervent spirits, burning with poetical imagination,\r\nsought in the monastic retreat redemption from their past sins: these\r\nmen of faith were happy to consecrate their whole existence to the\r\nornamentation of a single sacred book destined for the community which\r\ngave them in exchange all the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 364.--The Four Sons of Aymon on their good Steed,\r\nBayart. From a Miniature in the Romance of the “Four Sons of Aymon,” a\r\nManuscript of the Thirteenth Century. (Imperial Library, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nThis explains the absence of the names of the miniature-painters in\r\nancient manuscripts, particularly in those which are written in Latin.\r\nHowever, when romances and chronicles in the vulgar tongue began to come\r\ninto fashion, artists of great talent eagerly presented themselves to be\r\nengaged by princes and nobles who wished to have this sort of books\r\nornamented; but the anonymous which these lay artists generally\r\npreserved is explained by the circumstance that in most cases they were\r\nconsidered only as artistic assistants in the lordly houses where they\r\nwere employed, and in which they fulfilled some other domestic duty; for\r\ninstance, Colard de Laon, the favourite painter of Louis of Orleans, was\r\nalso valet-de-chambre to this prince; Pietro Andrea, another artist,\r\ndoubtless an Italian, to judge from his Christian name, was\r\ngentleman-usher; and we see this\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 365.--Miniature taken from the “Roman de Fauvel”\r\n(Fifteenth Century), representing Fauvel, or the Fox, reprimanding a\r\nWidow who has married again, and to whom is being given a Serenade of\r\nRough Music.\r\n\r\n(Imperial Library, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nsame painter “sent from Blois to Tours, to procure certain matters for\r\nthe accouchment of Madame the Duchess;” or again, “from Blois to\r\nRomorantin, to inquire after Madame d’Angoulesme, who was reported to be\r\nvery unwell.”\r\n\r\nCertain artists, however, who then took the modest name of illuminators,\r\nlived entirely by their profession; working at _tableaux benoîts_\r\n(blessed pictures), or popular paintings, which were sold at the\r\nchurch-doors. Others, again, were paid assistants of the recognised\r\npainters to princes or nobles; and the anonymous was quite naturally\r\nimposed upon them by their subordinate position, if not by the simple\r\nmodesty which was for a long time the accompaniment of talent. In the\r\nfourteenth century the study of miniatures is peculiarly interesting, on\r\naccount of the scenes of public and private life, of manners and\r\ncustoms, we find reproduced in them. Portraits after life, _d’après le\r\nvif_, as they were called in those days, made their appearance; and\r\ncaricature, at all times so powerful in France, already began to show\r\nitself with a daring which, occupying itself with the clergy, women, and\r\nchivalry, stopped only before the prestige of royalty.\r\n\r\nThe miniatures of a French manuscript, dated 1313 (Imperial Library,\r\nParis, No. 8,504, F. L.), deserve to be mentioned, especially on account\r\nof the various subjects they represent; for, besides the ceremony of the\r\nreception of the King of Navarre into the order of chivalry, we see in\r\nit philosophers discussing, judges administering the law, various scenes\r\nof conjugal life, singers accompanying themselves on divers instruments\r\nof music, villagers engaged in the labours of country life, &c. We must\r\nmention also a manuscript of the “Roman de Fauvel,” in which is\r\nespecially prominent the very original scene of a popular concert of\r\nrough music, by masked performers, given, according to an old custom, to\r\na widow who had married a second time (Fig. 365).\r\n\r\nThe period during which Charles V. occupied the throne of France is one\r\nof those that produced the finest specimens of manuscript-painting. This\r\nmonarch, the founder of the Royal Library, was an admirer of illustrated\r\nbooks, and had accumulated, at great cost, a large collection in the\r\ngreat tower of the Louvre. A royal prince, whom we have already\r\nmentioned as being excessively devoted to artistic luxuries, was the\r\nrival of Charles V. in this respect: this was his brother, the Duke Jean\r\nde Berry, who devoted enormous sums to the purchase and production of\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 366.--Border taken from a Prayer-book belonging to\r\nLouis of France, Duke of Anjou, King of Naples, of Sicily, and of\r\nJerusalem. (Fourteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 367.--Miniature taken from “Les Femmes Illustres,”\r\ntranslated from Boccacio. (Imperial Library, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nEven under Charles VI. this impulse did not abate, and the art of\r\npainting manuscripts was never in a more flourishing condition. The\r\nborder taken from the “Livre d’Heures,” or prayer-book, of the Duke\r\nd’Anjou, uncle of the king (Fig. 366), is an example of this. We might\r\nmention, as specimens of illustrated works of this period, the book of\r\nthe “Demandes et Réponses,” by Peter Salmon, a manuscript executed for\r\nthe king, and ornamented with exquisite miniatures, in which all the\r\ncharacters are true historical portraits, beautifully finished.\r\nNevertheless, the masterpieces of the French school at this period show\r\nthemselves in the miniatures of two translations of Boccacio’s “De\r\nClaris Mulieribus” (“Beautiful Women”) (Fig. 367).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 368.--Miniature of the Psalter of John, Duke of\r\nBerry, representing the Man of Sorrow, or Christ, showing the Sign of\r\nthe Cross. (Imperial Library, Paris.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 369.--Border taken from the Bible called Clement\r\nVII.’s. (Fourteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nAt that time two new styles appeared in the painting of manuscripts:\r\nminiatures _en camaïeu_ (in one colour only), and miniatures _en\r\ngrisaille_ (in two colours, viz., a light colour shaded, generally with\r\nbrown). Of the first kind, we may instance “Les Petites Heures” of John,\r\nDuke de Berry (Fig. 368), and “Les Miracles de Notre-Dame.”\r\n\r\nGermany did not in this respect rise to the height of France; but\r\nminiature-painting in Italy progressed more and more towards perfection.\r\nA remarkable specimen of Italian art of this period is the Bible called\r\nClement VII.’s (Fig. 369), which is preserved in the Imperial Library,\r\nParis. But there exists one more admirable still in the same\r\nestablishment, so rich in curiosities, of the manuscript of “The\r\nInstitution of the Order of the Holy Ghost,” an order of chivalry\r\nfounded at Naples in 1352, by Louis de Tarento, King of Naples, during a\r\nfeast on the day of Pentecost; it is in this superb manuscript, executed\r\nby Italian or French artists, may, perhaps, be found the most exquisite\r\nminiatures of that day (Fig. 370); especially remarkable are the\r\nbeautiful portraits in _camaïeu_ of King Louis and his wife, Jane I.,\r\nQueen of Naples. A valuable copy of the romance of “Lancelot du Lac,” of\r\nthe same date, recommends itself to the attention of connoisseurs by a\r\nrare peculiarity: one can follow in it the successive operations of the\r\npainter in miniature; thus are presented to us consecutively the\r\noutline-drawing, then the first tints, generally uniform, executed by\r\nthe illuminator; next the surface on which the gold is to be applied;\r\nthen the real work of the miniature-painter in the heads, costumes, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 370.--Miniature from a Manuscript of the Fourteenth\r\nCentury, representing Louis de Tarento, second Husband of Queen Jane of\r\nNaples, instituting the Order of the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n(Imperial Library, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nFrance, in spite of the great troubles which agitated her, and the wars\r\nshe had to maintain with foreign powers during the fifteenth century,\r\nsaw, nevertheless, the art of the painter improve very considerably. The\r\nfine copy of Froissart in the Imperial Library, Paris (Fig. 371), might\r\nalone suffice to prove the truth of this assertion. The name of John\r\nFoucquet, painter to King Louis XI., deserves to be mentioned with\r\neulogy, as that of one of the artists who contributed most to the\r\nprogress of painting on manuscripts. Everything thenceforward announced\r\nthe Renaissance which was to take place in the sixteenth century; and if\r\nwe wish to follow the onward progress of art from the beginning of the\r\nfifteenth century till the time\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORONATION OF CHARLES V., KING OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\nMiniature from Froissart’s Chronicles in the National Library, Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 371.--Border taken from “Froissart’s Chronicles,” a\r\nFrench Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century. (Imperial Library, Paris.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 372.--Border taken from an “Ovid.” An Italian\r\nManuscript of the Fifteenth Century. (Imperial Library, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nof Raphael, it is in the miniatures of manuscripts we shall find the\r\nbest evidences of it. Let us observe, by the way, that the Flemish\r\nschool of the Dukes of Burgundy exercised great influence over this\r\nmarvellous art for a period of more than a century. Spain was also\r\nprogressing; but it is to the Italian artists we must, from that time\r\nforward, look for the most remarkable works. The Imperial Library of\r\nParis possesses many manuscripts which bear witness to the marked\r\nimprovement in miniature-painting at this period; among others an “Ovid”\r\nof the fifteenth century (Fig. 372); but in order to see the highest\r\nexpression of the art, we must examine an incomparable copy of Dante’s\r\nworks, preserved in the Vatican, a manuscript proceeding from the hands\r\nof Giulio Clovio (Fig. 373), an illustrious painter, pupil and imitator\r\nof Raphael: his miniatures are remarkable for beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 373.--Miniature, painted by Giulio Clovio, of the\r\nSixteenth Century, taken from Dante’s “Paradise,” representing the Poet\r\nand Beatrice transported to the Moon, the abode of Women devoted to\r\nChastity. (Manuscript in the Vatican Library, Rome.)]\r\n\r\nLastly, in the reign of Louis XII., the complete regeneration of the\r\nArts was effected. We should, however, mention that at this period\r\nthere were two very distinct schools: one whose style still showed the\r\ninfluence of ancient Gothic traditions, the other entirely dependent on\r\nItalian taste. The Missal of Pope Paul V. emanated from this last school\r\n(Fig. 374).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 374.--Border taken from the Missal of Pope Paul V.\r\n(An Italian Manuscript of the Sixteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nThis immense progress, which showed itself simultaneously in France and\r\nin Italy by the production of many original works, seems to have\r\nattained its climax in the execution of a justly celebrated manuscript,\r\nknown by the name of “Heures d’Anne de Bretagne” (Fig. 375). Among the\r\nnumerous pictures which decorate this book of prayers, many would not be\r\nunworthy of Raphael’s pencil: the expression in the face of the Virgin\r\nMary is, with many others, remarkable for its sweetness; the heads of\r\nthe angels have something divine in them; and the ornaments which occupy\r\nthe margin of each page are composed of flowers, fruits, and insects,\r\nrepresented with all the freshness and brilliancy of nature. This\r\ninimitable masterpiece was, like a sort of sublime testament, to mark\r\nthe glorious boundary-line of an art which must necessarily degenerate\r\nnow that the printing-press was causing the numerous class of scribes\r\nand illuminators of the Middle Ages to disappear. It has never revived\r\nsince, but at intervals; and then more to meet the requirements of fancy\r\nthan to be of any real use.\r\n\r\nA few manuscripts adorned with miniatures of the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury may still be mentioned, especially two “Livres d’Heures”\r\n(prayer-books) painted in _grisaille_, which\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 375.--Miniature from the Prayer-book of Anne de\r\nBretagne, representing the Archangel St. Michael.\r\n\r\n(Musée des Souverains.)]\r\n\r\nbelonged to Henry II., King of France (now in the Musée des Souverains),\r\nand the “Livre d’Heures,” executed for the Margrave of Baden by a\r\npainter of Lorraine or of Metz named Brentel (Fig. 376), who, however,\r\ndid nothing\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 376.--Miniature in the “Livre d’Heures” belonging to\r\nthe Margrave of Baden, representing the Portrait of the blessed Bernard\r\nof Baden, who died in the odour of Sanctity, on July 15, 1458.\r\n\r\n(Imperial Library, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nbut put together designs copied from the great masters of Italy and\r\nFlanders. There were, nevertheless, good miniature-painters in France up\r\nto the seventeenth century, to illustrate the manuscripts executed with\r\nso much taste by the famous Jarry and the caligraphers of his school.\r\nThe last manifestation of the art shines forth, for example, in the\r\nmagnificent “Livre d’Heures” presented to Louis XIV. by the pensioners\r\nof the Hôtel des Invalides, a remarkable work, but yet unworthy to\r\nappear by the side of the “Livre d’Heures d’Anne de Bretagne,” which the\r\npainter seems to have adopted as his model.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 377.--Escutcheon of France, taken from some\r\nOrnaments in the Manuscript of the “Institution of the Order of the Holy\r\nGhost.” (Fourteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKBINDING\r\n\r\n     Primitive Binding of Books.--Bookbinding among the\r\n     Romans.--Bookbinding with Goldsmith’s Work from the Fifth\r\n     Century.--Chained Books.--Corporation of _Lieurs_, or\r\n     Bookbinders.--Books bound in Wood, with Metal Corners and\r\n     Clasps.--First Bindings in Leather, honeycombed (_waffled_?) and\r\n     gilt.--Description of some celebrated Bindings of the Fourteenth\r\n     and Fifteenth Centuries.--Sources of Modern Bookbinding.--John\r\n     Grollier.--President De Thou.--Kings and Queens of France\r\n     Bibliomaniacs.--Superiority of Bookbinding in France.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ancients had made square books, more convenient to read\r\nthan the rolls, binding--that is to say, the art of reuniting the leaves\r\nstitched or stuck (_ligati_) into a movable back, between two square\r\npieces of wood, ivory, metal, or leather--bookbinding was invented. This\r\nprimitive binding, which had no other object than that of preserving the\r\nbooks, no other merit than than of solidity, was not long ere it became\r\nassociated with ornament, and thus put itself in relation with the\r\nluxury of Greek and Roman civilisation. Not contented with placing on\r\neach side of the volume a little tablet of cedar-wood or of oak, on\r\nwhich was written the title of the book (for books were then laid flat\r\non the shelves of the library), a piece of leather was stretched over\r\nthe edge to preserve it from dust, if the book was valuable, and the\r\nvolume was tied up with a strap passed round it many times, and which\r\nwas subsequently replaced by clasps. In certain instances the volume was\r\nenveloped in thick cloth, and even enclosed in a case of wood or\r\nleather. Such was the state of bookbinding in ancient times.\r\n\r\nThere were then, as now, good and bad bookbinders. Cicero, in his\r\nletters to Atticus, asks for two of his slaves who were very clever\r\n_ligatores librorum_ (bookbinders). Bookbinding, however, was not an art\r\nvery generally known, for square books, notwithstanding the convenience\r\nof their shape, had not yet superseded rolls; but we see, in the Notices\r\nof the Dignities of the Eastern Empire (“Notitia Dignitatum Imperii),\r\nwritten towards 450, that this accessory art had already made immense\r\nprogress; since certain officers of the empire used to carry, in the\r\npublic ceremonies, large square books containing the administrative\r\ninstructions of the emperor: these books were bound, covered with green,\r\nred, blue, or yellow leather, closed by means of leathern straps or by\r\nhooks, and ornamented with little golden rods disposed horizontally, or\r\nlozengewise, with the portrait of the sovereign painted or gilt on their\r\nsides. From the fifth century goldsmiths and lapidaries\r\nornamented binding with great richness. And so we hear St. Jerome\r\nexclaiming:--“Your books are covered with precious stones, and Christ\r\ndied naked before the gate of his temple!” “The Book of the Gospels,” in\r\nGreek, given to the basilica of Monza by Theodelinda, queen of the\r\nLombards, about 600, has still one of these costly bindings.\r\n\r\nA specimen of Byzantine art, preserved in the Louvre, is a sort of small\r\nplate, which is supposed to be one of the sides of the cover of a book;\r\non it we find executed in bas-relief the “Visit of the Holy Women to the\r\nTomb,” and several other scenes from the Gospels. In this example the\r\nbeauty of the figures, the taste which dictated the arrangement of the\r\ndraperies, and the finish in the execution, furnish us with evidence\r\nthat, in the industrial arts, the Greeks had maintained till the twelfth\r\ncentury their pre-eminence over all the people of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn those days the binding of ordinary books was executed without any\r\nornamentation, this being reserved for sacred books. If, in the\r\ntreasures of churches, abbeys, and palaces, a few manuscripts covered\r\nwith gold, silver, and precious stones were kept as relics, books in\r\ncommon use were simply covered in boards or leather; but not without\r\nmuch attention being given to the binding, which was merely intended to\r\npreserve the volumes. Many documents bear witness to the great care and\r\nprecision with which, in certain monasteries, books were bound and\r\npreserved. All sorts of skins were employed in covering them when they\r\nhad been once pressed and joined together between boards of hard wood\r\nthat would not readily decay: in the North, even the skins of seals and\r\nof sharks were employed, but pig-skin seems to have been used in\r\npreference to all others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PANEL OF A BOOK COVER.\r\n\r\nBas-relief in Gold Repoussé. Ninth Century. (in the Louvre.)]\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that we, perhaps, owe to their rich bindings, which\r\nwere well calculated to tempt thieves, the destruction of a number of\r\nvaluable manuscripts when towns or monasteries were sacked; but, on the\r\nother hand, the sumptuous bindings with which kings and nobles covered\r\nBibles, the Gospels, antiphonaries,[58] and missals, have certainly\r\npreserved to us very many curious examples that, without them, would by\r\ndegrees have deteriorated, or would not have escaped all the chances of\r\ndestruction to which they were exposed. It is thus, for instance, that\r\nthe famous manuscript of Sens has descended to us, which contains “La\r\nMesse des Fous,” set to music in the twelfth century; it is bound\r\nbetween two pieces of ivory, with bas-relief carvings of the fourth\r\ncentury, representing the festivals of Bacchus. All great public\r\ncollections show with pride some of these rare and venerable bindings,\r\ndecorated with gold, silver, or copper, engraved, chased, or inlaid with\r\nprecious stones or coloured glass, with cameos or antique ivories (Fig.\r\n378). The greater number of rich books of the Gospels mentioned in\r\nhistory date back as far as the period of Charlemagne, and among these\r\nwe must mention, above all, one given by the emperor himself to the\r\nAbbey of St. Riquier, “covered with plates of silver, and ornamented\r\nwith gold and gems;” that of St. Maximinius of Treves, which came from\r\nAda, daughter of Pepin, sister of Charlemagne, and was ornamented with\r\nan engraved agate representing Ada, the emperor, and his sons; and\r\nlastly, one that was to be seen as late as 1727 in the convent of\r\nHautvillers, near Epernay, and which was bound in carved ivory.\r\n\r\nSometimes these sumptuous volumes were enclosed in an envelope made of\r\nrich stuff; or, in pursuance of an ancient custom, a casket not less\r\ngorgeously decorated than the binding, contained it. The Prayer-book of\r\nCharlemagne, now preserved in the Library of the Louvre, is known to\r\nhave been originally enclosed in a small casket of silver gilt, on which\r\nwere represented in relief the “Mysteries of the Passion.”\r\n\r\nThese books, however, bound with goldsmith’s work, were not those that\r\nwere chained in churches and in certain libraries (Fig. 379), as some\r\nvolumes still in existence show, with the rings through which passed the\r\nchain that fastened them to the desk. These _catenati_ (chained books)\r\nwere generally Bibles and missals, bound in wood and heavily ornamented\r\nwith metallic corners; which, while placed at the disposition of the\r\nfaithful and of the public in general, their owners wished to guarantee\r\nagainst being stolen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 378.--Binding in Gold, adorned with precious Stones\r\nwhich covered a “Book of the Gospels” of the Eleventh Century,\r\nrepresenting Jesus Crucified, with the Virgin and St. John at the Foot\r\nof the Cross.\r\n\r\n(Musée du Louvre).]\r\n\r\nWe must not forget to mention, among the most beautiful bindings of the\r\neleventh and twelfth centuries, the coverings of books in enamelled\r\ncopper (Fig. 380). The Museum of Cluny possesses two plates of incrusted\r\nenamel of Limoges, which must have belonged to one of these bindings:\r\nthe first has for its subject the “Adoration of the Magi;” the other\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IVORY DIPTYCH OF THE LOWER EMPIRE.\r\n\r\nServing as a Book Cover, “l’Office des fous.”. (In the Library of\r\nSens)]\r\n\r\nrepresents the monk Etienne de Muret, founder of the order of Grandmont\r\n(in the twelfth century), conversing with St. Nicholas. The Cathedral of\r\nMilan contains in its treasury the covering of a book still more ancient\r\nand much richer, about fourteen inches long by twelve inches wide, and\r\nprofusely covered with incrusted enamel, mounted and ornamented with\r\npolished, but uncut, precious stones of various colours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 379.--Library of the University of Leyden, in which\r\nall the Books were chained, even in the Seventeenth Century.]\r\n\r\nBut all these were only the work of enamellers, goldsmiths,\r\nilluminators, and clasp-makers. The binders, or bookbinders properly so\r\ncalled, fastened together the leaves of books, and placed them between\r\ntwo boards, which they then covered with leather, skin, stuff, or\r\nparchment; they added to these coverings sometimes leathern straps,\r\nsometimes metal clasps, sometimes hooks, to keep the volume firmly\r\nclosed, and almost always nails, whose round and projecting heads\r\npreserved the flat surface of the binding from being rubbed.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1299, when the tax was imposed upon the inhabitants of Paris\r\nfor the exigencies of the king, it was ascertained that the number of\r\nbookbinders then actually in the town amounted only to seventeen, who,\r\nas well as the scribes and booksellers, were directly dependent on the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 380.--Large Painted Initial Letter in a Manuscript\r\nin the Royal Library, Brussels, showing the arrangement of the Binding,\r\nin enamelled Metal, of a book of the Gospels. (Ninth or Tenth\r\nCentury.)]\r\n\r\nUniversity, the authorities of which placed them under the surveillance\r\nof four sworn bookbinders, who were considered the _agents_ of the\r\nUniversity. We must except, however, from this jurisdiction the\r\nacknowledged bookbinder to the “Chambre des Comptes,” who, before he\r\ncould be appointed to this office, had to make an affirmation _that he\r\ncould neither read nor write_.\r\n\r\nIn the musters, or processions, of the University of Paris, the\r\nbookbinders came after the booksellers. To explain the relatively small\r\nnumber of professed bookbinders, we must remember that at this period\r\nthe majority of scholars bound their own books, as divers passages of\r\nancient authors prove; while the monasteries, which were the principal\r\ncentres of bookmakers, had one or many members of their community whose\r\nspecial function it was to bind the works written within their walls.\r\nTritheimius, Abbot of Spanheim at the end of the fifteenth century, does\r\nnot forget the bookbinders in the enumeration he makes of the different\r\nemployments of his monks:--“Let that one,” says he, “fasten the leaves\r\ntogether, and bind the book with boards. You, prepare those boards; you,\r\ndress the leather; you, the metal plates, which are to adorn the\r\nbinding.” These bindings are represented on the seal of the University\r\nof Oxford (Fig. 381), and on the banners of some French corporation of\r\nprinters and booksellers (Figs. 382 and 386).\r\n\r\nThe metal plates, the corners, the nails, the clasps with which these\r\nvolumes were then laden rendered them so heavy that, in order to enable\r\nthe reader to turn over the leaves with facility, they were placed on\r\none of those revolving desks having space for many open folios at the\r\nsame time, and which were capable of accommodating many readers\r\nsimultaneously. It is said that Petrarch had caused a volume containing\r\nthe “Epistles of Cicero,” transcribed by himself, to be bound so\r\nmassively, that as he was continually reading it, he often let it fall\r\nand injured his leg; so badly once that he was threatened with\r\namputation. This manuscript in Petrarch’s handwriting is still to be\r\nseen in the Laurentian Library at Florence; it is bound in wood, with\r\nedges and clasps of copper.\r\n\r\nThe Crusades, which introduced into Europe many luxurious customs, must\r\nhave had great influence on bookbinding, since the Arabs had for a long\r\nwhile known the art of preparing, dyeing, stamping, and gilding the\r\nskins they employed to make covers for books: these covers took the name\r\nof _alæ_ (the wings), no doubt from the resemblance between them and\r\nthe wings of a bird of rich plumage. The Crusaders having brought back\r\nfrom their expeditions specimens of Oriental binding, our European\r\nworkmen did not fail to turn their brilliant models to account.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 381.--Seal of the University of Oxford, in which is\r\na Book bound with Corners and Clasps.]\r\n\r\nAn entire revolution, moreover, which had taken place in the formation\r\nof royal and princely libraries, was to produce a revolution in binding\r\nalso. Bibles, missals, reproductions of ancient authors, treatises on\r\ntheology, were no longer the only books in common use. The new language\r\nhad given rise to histories, romances, and poems, which were the delight\r\nof a society becoming more and more polished every day. For the pleasure\r\nof readers, the gallant of one sex and the fair of the other, books were\r\nrequired more agreeable to the eye, and less rough to the touch, than\r\nthose used for the edification of monks or the instruction of scholars.\r\nAnd first of all were substituted, for the purpose of manuscripts, sizes\r\nmore portable than the grave folio. Then fine and smooth vellum was used\r\nfor writing, and books were covered in velvet, silk, or woollen stuffs.\r\nMoreover, paper, a recent invention, opened up a new era for libraries;\r\nbut two centuries were to elapse before pasteboard had entirely taken\r\nthe place of wooden covers.\r\n\r\nIt is in the inventories, in the accounts, and in the archives of kings\r\nand princes, we must look for the history of bookbinding in the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries (Fig. 383). We shall limit ourselves\r\nto giving a description of some costly bindings, taken from the\r\ninventories of the magnificent libraries of the Dukes of Burgundy and of\r\nOrleans, now partly destroyed, and partly scattered about among the\r\ngreat public collections of France and other countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 382.--Banner of the Corporation of\r\nPrinters-Booksellers of Angers.]\r\n\r\nBelonging to the Dukes of Burgundy, Philip the Bold, Jean sans Peur, and\r\nPhilip the Good, we see a small Book of the Gospels and of the “Heures\r\nde la Croix” (a kind of prayer-book), with “a binding embellished with\r\ngold and fifty-eight large pearls, in a case made of camlet, with one\r\nlarge pearl and a cluster of small pearls;” the romance of the “Moralité\r\ndes Hommes sur le Ju (jeu) des Eschiers” (the game of chess), “covered\r\nin silk, with white and red flowers, and silver-gilt nails, on a green\r\nground;” a Book of Orisons, “covered in red leather, with silver-gilt\r\nnails;” a Psalter, “having two silver-gilt clasps, bound in blue, with a\r\ngolden eagle with two heads and red talons, to which is attached a\r\nlittle silver-gilt instrument for turning over the leaves, with three\r\nescutcheons of the same arms, covered with a red velvet _chemise_.”[59]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 383.--Fragment of an engraved and stamped Binding in\r\nan unknown Material (Fifteenth Century), representing the mystical Chase\r\nof the Unicorn, which is taking refuge in the lap of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n(Public Library, Rouen.)]\r\n\r\nThe _chemise_ was a sort of pocket in which certain valuable books were\r\nenveloped. The “Heures de St. Louis” (St. Louis’s Prayer-book), now in\r\nthe Musée des Souverains, is still in its _chemise_ of red sandal-wood.\r\n\r\nBelonging to the Duke of Orleans, brother of Charles VI., we find\r\nVégèce’s book, “On Chivalry,” “covered in red leather inlaid, which has\r\ntwo little brass clasps;” the book of “Meliadus,” “covered in green\r\nvelvet, with two silver-gilt clasps, enamelled with the arms of his\r\nRoyal Highness;” the book of Boèce, “On Consolation,” “covered in\r\nfigured silk;” “The Golden Legend,” “covered in black velvet, without\r\nclasps;” the “Heures de Notre-Dame,” “covered in white leather.”\r\n\r\nThe same inventories give an account of the prices paid for some\r\nbindings and their accessories. Thus, in 1386, Martin Lhuillier, a\r\nbookseller at Paris, received from the Duke of Burgundy 16 francs\r\n(equivalent to about 114 francs French money of the present time), “for\r\nbinding eight books, of which six were covered in grained leather;” on\r\nSept. 19, 1394, the Duke of Orleans paid to Peter Blondel, goldsmith, 12\r\nlivres 15 sols, “for having _wrought_, besides the duke’s silver seal,\r\ntwo clasps” for the book of Boèce; and on Jan. 15, 1398, to Émelot de\r\nRubert, an embroideress at Paris, 50 _sols tournois_, “for having cut\r\nout and worked in gold and silk two covers of green Dampmas cloth, one\r\nfor the Breviary, the other for the Book of Hours of the aforesaid\r\nnobleman, and for having made fifteen markers (_sinets_) and four pair\r\nof silk and gold straps for the said books.”\r\n\r\nThe old style of thick, heavy, in some sort armour-plated, binding,\r\ncould not exist long after the invention of printing, which, while\r\nmultiplying books, diminished their weight, reduced their size, and,\r\nmoreover, gave them a less intrinsic value. Wooden boards were replaced\r\nby compressed cardboard, nails and clasps were gradually laid aside, and\r\nstuffs of different kinds no longer used; only skin, leather, and\r\nparchment were employed. This was the beginning of modern binding; but\r\nbookbinders were as yet but mechanics working for the booksellers, who,\r\nwhen they had on their premises a bookbinding-room (Fig. 384), assumed,\r\nin their editions, the double title of _libraire-relieur_\r\n(bookseller-bookbinder) (Fig. 385). In 1578, Nicholas Eve still placed\r\non his books and his sign-board, “Bookseller to the University of Paris\r\nand Bookbinder to the King.” No volume was sold unbound.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the fifteenth century, although bookbinding was always\r\nconsidered as an adjunct to the bookseller’s shop, certain amateurs who\r\nhad a taste for art required richer and more _recherché_ exteriors for\r\ntheir books. Italy set us the example of beautiful bindings in morocco,\r\nstamped and gilt; imitated, however, from those of the Koran and other\r\nArabian manuscripts, which Venetian navigators frequently brought back\r\nwith them from the East. The expedition of Charles VIII. and the wars of\r\nLouis XII. introduced into France not only Italian bindings, but Italian\r\nbinders also. Without renouncing, however, at least for the _livres\r\nd’heures_, the bindings ornamented with goldsmith’s work and gems,\r\nFrance had very soon binders of her own, surpassing those who had been\r\nto them as initiators or masters. Jean Grollier, of Lyons, loved books\r\ntoo much not to wish to give them an exterior ornamentation worthy of\r\nthe wealth of knowledge they contained. Treasurer of War, and Intendant\r\nof the Milanese before the battle of Pavia, he had begun to create a\r\nlibrary, which he subsequently transported into France, and did not\r\ncease to enlarge and to enrich till his death, which happened in 1565.\r\nHis books were bound in morocco from the Levant, with such care and\r\ntaste that, under the supervision of this exacting amateur, bookbinding\r\nseemed to have already attained perfection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 384.--Bookbinders’ Work-room, drawn and engraved in\r\nthe Sixteenth Century, by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nPrinces and ladies of the court prided themselves on their love of books\r\nand the desire to acquire them; they founded libraries, and encouraged\r\nthe works and inventions of good bookbinders who produced masterpieces\r\nof patience and ability in decorating the covers of books, either with\r\nenamelled paintings, or with mosaics made of different pieces inlaid, or\r\nwith plain gildings stamped on the surface with small irons. It would be\r\nimpossible to enumerate the splendid bindings in all styles that the\r\nFrench bookbinders of the sixteenth century have left us, and which have\r\nnever been surpassed since. The painter, the engraver, and even the\r\ngoldsmith, co-operated with the bookbinder in his art, by furnishing him\r\nwith designs for ornaments. We now see reappearing some plates obtained\r\nfrom hot or cold dies, representing various subjects, and the designs\r\nfrom which they were taken, reproduced from those that had been in\r\nfashion towards the beginning of the sixteenth century, were often drawn\r\nby distinguished artists, such as Jean Cousin, Stephen de Laulne, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 385.--Mark of William Eustace (1512), Bookseller and\r\nBinder, Paris.]\r\n\r\nNearly all the French kings, especially the Valois, were passionately\r\nfond of splendid bindings. Catherine de Medicis was such a connoisseur\r\nof finely-bound books, that authors and booksellers, who eagerly\r\npresented her with copies of their works, tried to distinguish\r\nthemselves in the choice and beauty of the bindings which they had made\r\nexpressly for her. Henry III., who appreciated handsomely-bound books no\r\nless than his mother, invented a very singular binding, when he had\r\ninstituted the Order of “Penitents;” this consisted of death’s heads and\r\ncross bones, tears, crosses, and other instruments of the Passion, gilt\r\nor stamped on black morocco leather, and having the following device,\r\n“Spes mea Deus” (“God is my hope”), with or without the arms of France.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to associate these superb bindings with the usual and\r\ncommon work executed at the booksellers’ shops, and under their\r\nsuperintendence. Some booksellers of Paris and of Lyons, the houses of\r\nGryphe and Tournes, of Estienne and Vascosan, paid a little more\r\nattention, however, than others of the fraternity, to the binding of\r\nbooks which they sold to the reading public; they adopted patterns of\r\ndun-coloured calf, in compartments; or white vellum, with fillets and\r\narabesques in gold, fine specimens of which are now very rare.\r\n\r\nAt this period Italian bookbinding had reached the most complete state\r\nof decadency, while in Germany and other parts of Europe the old massive\r\nbindings,--bindings in wood, leather, and parchment, with fastenings of\r\niron or brass,--still held their ground. In France, however, the\r\nbinders, whom the booksellers kept in a state of obscurity and\r\nservitude, had not even been able to form themselves into a guild or\r\nfraternity. They might produce masterpieces of their art, but were not\r\nallowed to append their names to their works; and we must come down as\r\nfar as the famous _Gascon_ (1641) before we can introduce the name of\r\nany illustrious bookbinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 386.--Banner of the Corporation of\r\nPrinters-Booksellers of Autun.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTING\r\n\r\n     Who was the Inventor of Printing?--Movable Letters in Ancient\r\n     Times.--Block Printing.--Laurent Coster.--_Donati_ and\r\n     _Specula_.--Gutenberg’s Process.--Partnership of Gutenberg and\r\n     Faust.--Schoeffer.--The Mayence Bible.--The Psalter of 1457.--The\r\n     “Rationale” of 1459.--Gutenburg prints by himself.--The\r\n     “Catholicon” of 1460.--Printing at Cologne, Strasbourg, Venice, and\r\n     Paris.--Louis XI. and Nicholas Jenson.--German Printers at\r\n     Rome.--_Incunabula._--Colart Mansion.--Caxton.--Improvement of\r\n     Typographical Processes up to the Sixteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nFifteen towns have laid claim to the honour of being the birthplace of\r\nprinting, and writers who have applied themselves to search out the\r\norigin of this admirable invention, far from coming to any agreement on\r\nthe point in their endeavours to clear up the question, have only\r\nconfused it. Now, however, after many centuries of learned and earnest\r\ncontroversy, there only remain three antagonistic propositions, with\r\nthree names of towns, four names of inventors, and three different\r\ndates. The three places are Haarlem, Strasbourg, and Mayence; the four\r\ninventors, Laurent Coster, Gutenberg, Faust, and Schoeffer; the three\r\ndates which are assigned to the invention of printing are 1420, 1440,\r\n1450. In our opinion these three propositions, which some try to combat\r\nand destroy by opposing each to the other, ought, on the contrary, to be\r\nblended into one, and combined chronologically in such a manner as to\r\nrepresent the three principal periods of the discovery of printing.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that printing existed in the germ in ancient times;\r\nthat it was known and made use of by the ancients. There were stamps and\r\nseals bearing legends traced the wrong way, from which positive\r\nimpressions were obtained on papyrus or parchment, in wax, ink, or\r\ncolour. We are shown, in museums, plates of copper or of cedar-wood,\r\ncovered with characters carved or cut out in them, which seem to have\r\nbeen intended for the purpose of printing, and which resemble the block\r\nplates of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 387.--Ancient Wood-block Print, cut in Flanders\r\nbefore 1440, representing Jesus Christ after his Flagellation.\r\n(Delbecq’s Collection, Ghent.)]\r\n\r\nSomething very much like the process of printing in movable type is\r\ndescribed by Cicero in a passage in which he refutes the doctrine of\r\nEpicurus on the creation of the world by atoms: “Why not believe, also,\r\nthat by throwing together, indiscriminately, innumerable forms of\r\nletters of the alphabet, either in gold or in any other substance, one\r\ncan _print_ with these letters, on the ground, the _Annals_ of Ennius?”\r\nThe movable letters possessed by the ancients were carved in box-wood or\r\nivory; but they were only employed for teaching children to read, as\r\nQuinctilian testifies in his “Oratorical Institutions,” and St. Jerome\r\nin his “Epistles.” There was then only wanting a fortunate chance to\r\ncause this carved alphabet to create the typographic art fifteen\r\ncenturies earlier than its actual birth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 388.--Fac-simile of an Engraving on Wood, by an\r\nancient Flemish Engraver (about 1438); which was inserted, after the\r\nmanner of a Miniature, in a Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century,\r\ncontaining Prayers for the use of the People. (Delbecq’s Collection,\r\nGhent.)]\r\n\r\n“The art of taking impressions once discovered,” says M. Léon de\r\nLaborde, “and applied to engraving in relief, gave rise to printing,\r\nwhich was only the perfection to which a natural and rapid progression\r\nof attempts and efforts would naturally lead.” “But it was only,” adds\r\nM. Ambroise-Firmin Didot, “when the art of making paper--that art\r\nfamiliar to the Chinese from the beginning of our era--spread in Europe\r\nand became generally known, that the reproduction, by pressing, of\r\ntexts, figures, playing-cards, &c., first by the tabular process,\r\ncalled _xylography_ (block-printing), then with movable types, became\r\neasy, and was consequently to appear simultaneously in different\r\nplaces.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 389.--Wood-block, cut in France, about 1440,\r\nrepresenting an Image of St. James the Great, with one of the\r\nCommandments as a Text. (Imperial Library, Paris, Collection of\r\nPrints.)]\r\n\r\nBut, at the end of the fourteenth century, at Haarlem, in Holland,\r\nwood-engraving had been discovered, and consequently _tabular\r\nimpression_, with which the Chinese, it is said, were already acquainted\r\nthree or four hundred years before the modern era. Perhaps it was some\r\nChinese book or pack of cards brought to Haarlem by a merchant or a\r\nnavigator, that revealed to the cardmakers and printsellers of the\r\nindustrious Netherlands a process of impressing more expeditious and\r\nmore economical. Xylography began on the day when a legend was engraved\r\non a wood-block; this legend, limited at first to a few lines, very soon\r\noccupied a whole page; then this page was not long in becoming a volume\r\n(Fig. 387 to 389).\r\n\r\nHere is an extract from the account given by Adrian Junius, in his Latin\r\nwork entitled “Batavia,” of the discovery of printing at Haarlem,\r\nwritten in 1572:--“More than one hundred and thirty-two years ago there\r\nlived at Haarlem, close to the royal palace, one John Laurent, surnamed\r\nCoster (or governer), for this honourable post came to him by\r\ninheritance, being handed down in his family from father to son. One\r\nday, about 1420, as he was walking after dinner in a wood near the town,\r\nhe set to work and cut the bark of beech-trees into the shape of\r\nletters, with which he traced, on paper, by pressing one after the\r\nother upon it, a model composed of many lines for the instruction of his\r\nchildren. Encouraged by this success, his genius took a higher flight,\r\nand then, in concert with his son-in-law, Thomas Pierre, he invented a\r\nspecies of ink more glutinous and tenacious than that employed in\r\nwriting, and he thus printed figures (_images_) to which he added his\r\nwooden letters. I have myself seen many copies of this first attempt at\r\nprinting. The text is on one side only of the paper. The book printed\r\nwas written in the vulgar tongue, by an anonymous author, having as its\r\ntitle ‘Speculum nostræ Salutis’ (‘The Mirror of our Salvation’). Later,\r\nLaurent Coster changed his wooden types into leaden, then these into\r\npewter. Laurent’s new invention, encouraged by studious men, attracted\r\nfrom all parts an immense concourse of purchasers. The love of the art\r\nincreased, the labours of his workshop increased also, and Laurent was\r\nobliged to add hired workmen to the members of his family, to assist in\r\nhis operations. Among these workmen there was a certain John, whom I\r\nsuspect of being none other than Faust, who was treacherous and fatal to\r\nhis master. Initiated, under the seal of an oath, into all the secrets\r\nof printing, and having become very expert in casting type, in setting\r\nit up, and in the other processes of his trade, this John took advantage\r\nof a Christmas evening, while every one was in church, to rifle his\r\nmaster’s workshop and to carry off his typographical implements. He fled\r\nwith his booty to Amsterdam, thence to Cologne, and afterwards to\r\nMayence, where he established himself; and calculating upon safety here,\r\nset up a printing-office. In that very same year, 1422, he printed with\r\nthe type which Laurent had employed at Haarlem, a grammar then in use,\r\ncalled ‘Alexandri Galli Doctrinale,’ and a ‘Treatise of Peter the\r\nSpaniard’ (‘Petri Hispani Tractatus’).”\r\n\r\nThis account, which came, indeed, rather late, although the author\r\nreferred to the most respectable authorities in support of it, met at\r\nfirst with nothing but incredulity and contempt. At this period the\r\nright of Mayence to be considered the birthplace of printing could only\r\nbe seriously counterbalanced by the right Strasbourg had to be so\r\nconsidered. The three names of Gutenberg, of Faust, and of Schœffer were\r\nalready consecrated by universal gratitude. Everywhere, then, except in\r\nHolland, this new testimony was rejected; everywhere the new inventor,\r\nwhose claim had just been made for a share of the honour, was rejected\r\nas an apocryphal or legendary being. But very soon, however, criticism,\r\nraising itself above the influences of nationality, took up the\r\nquestion, discussed the account given by Junius, examined that famous\r\n“Speculum” which no one had yet pointed out, proved the existence of\r\nxylographic impressions, sought for those which could be attributed to\r\nCoster, and opposed to the Abbé Tritheim (or Trithemius), who had\r\nwritten on the origin of printing from information furnished by Peter\r\nSchœffer himself, the more disinterested testimony of the anonymous\r\nchronicler of Cologne in 1465, who had learned from Ulric Zell, one of\r\nGutenberg’s workmen, and the first printer of Cologne in 1465, this\r\nimportant peculiarity:--“Although the typographic art was invented at\r\nMayence,” says he, “nevertheless the first rough sketch of this art was\r\ninvented in Holland, and it is in imitation of the ‘Donatus’ (the Latin\r\nsyntax by Cœlius Donatus, a grammarian of the fourth century, a book\r\nthen in use in the schools of Europe), which long before that time was\r\nprinted there; it is in imitation of this, and on account of it, that\r\nthe said art began under the auspices of Gutenberg.”\r\n\r\nIf Gutenberg imitated the “Donatus,” which was printed in Holland before\r\nthe time he himself printed at Mayence, Gutenberg was not the inventor\r\nof printing. It was in 1450 that Gutenberg began to print at Mayence\r\n(Fig. 390); but from as early a date as 1436 he had tried to print at\r\nStrasbourg; and, before his first attempts, there had been printed in\r\nHolland,--at Haarlem, and Dordrecht,--“Specula” and “Donati” on wooden\r\nboards; a process known by the name of _xylography_ (engraving on wood),\r\nwhile the attempts at _typography_ (printing with movable type) made by\r\nGutenberg entirely differed from the other; since the letters, engraved\r\nat first on steel points (_poinçons_), and afterwards forced into a\r\ncopper matrix reproduced by means of casting in a metal more fusible\r\nthan copper the impress of the point on shanks (_tiges_) made of pewter\r\nor lead, hardened by an alloy (Fig. 391).\r\n\r\nNow, a rather singular circumstance comes to corroborate what was said\r\nby Adrian Junius. A Latin edition of the “Speculum,” an in-folio of\r\nsixty-three leaves, with wood engravings in two compartments at the head\r\nof each leaf, consists of a mixture of twenty xylographic leaves, and of\r\nforty-one leaves printed with movable type, but very imperfect, and cast\r\nin moulds which were probably made of baked earth: an edition of a\r\nDutch “Speculum,” in folio, has also two pages in a type smaller and\r\ncloser than the rest of the text. How are we to explain these anomalies?\r\nOn the one hand, a mixture of xylography and typography; on the other, a\r\ncombination of two different kinds of movable type. My hypothesis is, if\r\nindeed the details given by Junius, open to suspicion as they are, be\r\ncorrect, that the dishonest workman who, according to his own account,\r\nstole the implements\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 390.--Fac-simile of a Page of the most ancient\r\nXylographie “Donatus” (Chapter on Prepositions), printed at Mayence, by\r\nFust and Gutenberg, about 1450.]\r\n\r\nemployed in the workshop of Laurent Coster, and who must have acted with\r\na certain amount of precipitation, contented himself with carrying off\r\nsome forms of the “Speculum” just ready for the press. The type employed\r\nfor twenty or twenty-two pages was sufficient to serve as models for a\r\ncounterfeit edition, and also for a book of small extent, such as the\r\n“Alexandri Galli Doctrinale,” and the “Petri Hispani Tractatus.” It is\r\nprobable that the Latin and Dutch editions of the “Speculum” were both\r\nentirely composed, set up, and prepared for the text to be struck off,\r\nwhen the thief took at hazard the twenty-two forms, which he determined\r\nto turn to account, at any rate as a model for the counterfeit edition\r\nhe intended to publish. In cast-iron type, these forms could not have\r\nweighed more than sixty pounds; in wooden type, not half as much; if we\r\nadd to these the composing-sticks, the pincers, the galleys, and other\r\nindispensable elements of the trade, we shall find that the booty was\r\nnot beyond the strength of a man to carry easily on his shoulders. As\r\nfor the press, about that there could be no question, since the\r\nimpressions produced at Haarlem were made with a pad and by hand, as is\r\nstill the case with playing-cards and prints.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 391.--Portrait of Gutenberg, from an Engraving of\r\nthe Sixteenth Century.\r\n\r\n(Imperial Library of Paris, Print Room.)]\r\n\r\nIt remains now to discover who was this John who appropriated the secret\r\nof printing, and took it from Haarlem to Mayence. Was it John Fust or\r\nFaust, as Adrian Junius suspected? Was it John Gutenberg, as many Dutch\r\nwriters have alleged? or was it not rather John Gensfleisch the elder, a\r\nrelation of Gutenberg, as, from a very explicit passage of the learned\r\nJoseph Wimpfeling, his contemporary, the latest defenders of the Haarlem\r\ntradition think? The question is still undecided.\r\n\r\nThe “Speculum,” however, is not the only book of the kind which\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 392.--Fac-simile of the Twenty-eighth Xylographic\r\nPage of the “Biblia Pauperum;” representing, with Texts taken from the\r\nOld Testament, David slaying Goliath, and Christ causing the Souls of\r\nthe Patriarchs and Prophets to come out of Purgatory.]\r\n\r\nhad appeared in the Low Countries before the period assigned to the\r\ndiscovery of printing in Holland. Some of these were evidently\r\nxylographic, others show signs of having been printed with movable type\r\nof wood, not of metal. All have engravings of the same character as\r\nthose of the “Speculum,” especially the “Biblia Pauperum” (“Poor Men’s\r\nBible”) (Fig. 392), the “Ars Moriendi” (“The Art of Dying”) (Fig. 393)\r\nthe “Ars Memorandi” (“The Art of Remembering”), which had a very wide\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, Laurent Coster, notwithstanding the progress he had\r\nmade with his invention, was certainly ignorant of its importance. In\r\nthose days the only libraries were those belonging to convents and to a\r\nfew nobles of literary acquirements; private individuals, with the\r\nexception of some learned men who were richer than their fellows,\r\npossessed no books at all. The copyists and illuminators by profession\r\nwere employed exclusively in reproducing “Livres d’Heures”\r\n(prayer-books), and school books: the first were sumptuous volumes,\r\nobjects of an industry quite exceptional; the second, destined for\r\nchildren, were always simply executed, and composed of a few leaves of\r\nstrong paper or parchment. The pupils limited themselves to writing\r\npassages of their lessons from the dictation of their teachers; to the\r\nmonks was assigned the task of transcribing, at full length, the sacred\r\nand profane authors. Coster could not even have thought of reproducing\r\nthese works, the sale of which would have seemed to him impossible, and\r\nhe at first fell back upon the “Specula,” religious books which\r\naddressed themselves to all the faithful, even to those who could not\r\nread, by means of the stories or illustrations (_images_) of which these\r\nbooks were composed; then he occupied himself with the “Donati,” which\r\nhe reprinted many times from xylographic plates, if not with movable\r\ntype, and for which he must have found a considerable demand. It was one\r\nof these “Donati” that, falling under the eyes of Gutenberg, revealed to\r\nhim, according to the “Chronique de Cologne,” the secret of printing.\r\n\r\nThis secret was kept faithfully for fifteen or twenty years by the\r\nworkmen employed in his printing-house, who were not initiated into the\r\nmysteries of the new art till they had served a certain time of\r\nprobation and apprenticeship: a terrible oath bound together those whom\r\nthe master had considered worthy of entering into partnership with him;\r\nfor on the preservation of the secret depended the prosperity or the\r\nruin of the inventor and his coadjutors, since all printed books were\r\nthen sold as manuscripts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 393.--Fac-simile of the fifth Page of the first\r\nXylographic Edition of the “Ars Moriendi,” representing the Sinner on\r\nhis Death-bed surrounded by his Family. Two Demons are whispering into\r\nhis ear, “Think of thy treasure,” and “Distribute it to thy friends.”]\r\n\r\nBut while the secret was so scrupulously maintained by the first Dutch\r\nprinter and his partners, a lawsuit was brought before the superior\r\ncourt of Strasbourg which, though the motives for it were apparently but\r\nof private interest, was nevertheless to give the public the key to the\r\nmysterious trade of the typographer. This lawsuit,--the curious\r\ndocuments relating to which were found only in 1760, in an old tower at\r\nStrasbourg,--was brought against John Gensfleisch, called Gutenberg (who\r\nwas born at Mayence, but was exiled from his native town during the\r\npolitical troubles, and had settled at Strasbourg since 1420), by George\r\nand Nicholas Dritzehen, who, as heirs of the deceased Andrew Dritzehen,\r\ntheir brother, and formerly Gutenberg’s partner, desired to be admitted\r\nas his representatives into an association of whose object they were\r\nignorant, but from which they no doubt knew their brother expected to\r\nderive some beneficial results. It was, in short, printing itself which\r\nwas on its trial at Strasbourg towards the end of the year 1439; that\r\nis, more than fourteen years before the period at which printing is\r\nknown to have been first employed in Mayence.\r\n\r\nHere is a summary, as we find them in the documents relating to this\r\nlawsuit, of the facts stated before the judge. Gutenberg, an ingenious\r\nbut a poor man, possessed _divers secrets_ for becoming rich. Andrew\r\nDritzehen came to him with a request that he would teach him _many\r\narts_. Gutenberg thereupon initiated him into the art of _polishing\r\nstones_, and Andrew “derived great profit from this secret.”\r\nSubsequently, with the object of carrying out _another art_ during the\r\npilgrimage of Aix-la-Chapelle,[60] Gutenberg agreed with Hans Riffen,\r\nmayor of Lichtenau, to form a company, which Andrew Dritzehen and a man\r\nnamed Andrew Heilman desired to join. Gutenberg consented to this on\r\ncondition that they would together purchase of him the right to a third\r\nof the profits, for a sum of 160 florins, payable on the day of the\r\ncontract, and 80 florins payable at a later date. The agreement being\r\nmade, he taught them the _art_ which they were to exercise at the proper\r\nperiod in Aix-la-Chapelle; but the pilgrimage was postponed to the\r\nfollowing year, and the partners required of Gutenberg that he should\r\nnot conceal from them any of the _arts and inventions_ of which he was\r\ncognisant. New stipulations were entered upon whereby the partners\r\npledged themselves to pay an additional sum, and in which it was stated\r\nthat the _art_ should be carried on for the benefit of the four\r\npartners during the space of five years; and that, in the event of one\r\nof them dying, _all the implements of the art, and all the works already\r\nproduced_, should belong to the surviving partners; the heirs of the\r\ndeceased being entitled to receive no more than an indemnity of 100\r\nflorins at the expiration of the said five years.\r\n\r\nGutenberg accordingly offered to pay the heirs of his late partner the\r\nstipulated sum; but they demanded of him an account of the capital\r\ninvested by Andrew Dritzehen, which, as they alleged, had been absorbed\r\nin the speculation. They mentioned especially a certain account for\r\n_lead_, for which their brother had made himself responsible. Without\r\ndenying this account, Gutenberg refused to satisfy their demands.\r\n\r\nNumerous witnesses gave evidence, and their depositions for and against\r\nthe object of the association show us a faithful picture of what must\r\nhave been the inner life of four partners exhausting themselves and\r\ntheir money in efforts to realise a scheme the nature of which they were\r\nvery careful to conceal, but from which they expected to derive the most\r\nsplendid results.\r\n\r\nWe find them working by night; we hear them answering those who\r\nquestioned them on the object of their work, that they were\r\n“mirror-makers” (_spiegel-macher_); we find them borrowing money,\r\nbecause they had in hand “something in which they could not invest too\r\nmuch money.” Andrew Dritzehen, in whose care the _press_ was left, being\r\ndead, Gutenberg’s first object was to send to the deceased’s house a man\r\nhe could trust, who was commissioned to unscrew the press, so that the\r\npieces (or _forms_), which were fixed closely together by it, might\r\nbecome detached from each other, and then to place these forms in or on\r\nthe press “in such a manner that no one might be able to understand what\r\nthey were.” Gutenberg regrets that his servant did not bring him back\r\nall the forms, many of which “were not to be found.” Lastly, we find\r\nfiguring among the witnesses a turner, a timber-merchant, and a\r\ngoldsmith who declared that he had worked during three years for\r\nGutenberg, and that he had gained more than 100 florins by preparing for\r\nhim “the things belonging to printing” (_das zu dem Trucken gehoret_).\r\n\r\n_Trucken_--printing! Thus the grand word was pronounced in the course of\r\nthe lawsuit, but certainly without producing the least effect on the\r\naudience, who wondered what was this occult _art_ which Gutenberg and\r\nhis partners had carried on with so much trouble, and at such great\r\nexpense. However, it is quite certain that, with the exception of the\r\nindiscretion, really very insignificant, of the goldsmith, Gutenberg’s\r\nsecret remained undiscovered, for it was supposed it had to do with the\r\n_polishing of stones_ and the manufacture of _mirrors_. The judge, being\r\ninformed as to the good faith of Gutenberg, pronounced the offers he\r\nmade to the plaintiffs satisfactory, decided against the heirs of Andrew\r\nDritzehen, and the three other partners remained sole proprietors of\r\ntheir process, and continued to carry it out.\r\n\r\nIf we study with some attention the documents relating to this singular\r\ntrial at Strasbourg, and if we also notice, that our word _mirror_ is\r\nthe translation of the German word _spiegel_ and of the Latin word\r\n_speculum_, it is impossible not to recognise all the processes, all the\r\nimplements made use of in printing, with the names they have not ceased\r\nto bear, and which were given to them as soon as they were invented; the\r\nforms, the screw (which is not the _printing_-press, for they printed in\r\nthose days with the _frotton_, or rubber, but the frame in which the\r\ntypes were _pressed_), the lead, the work, the art, &c. We see Gutenberg\r\naccompanied by a turner who made the screw for the press, the timber\r\nmerchant who had supplied the planks of box or of pear wood, the\r\ngoldsmith who had engraved or cast the type. Then we ascertain that\r\nthese “mirrors,” in the preparation of which the partners were occupied,\r\nand which were to be sold at the pilgrimage of Aix-la-Chapelle, were no\r\nother than the future copies of the “Speculum Humanæ Salvationis,” an\r\nimitation more or less perfect of the famous book of illustrations of\r\nwhich Holland had already published three or four editions, in Latin and\r\nin Dutch.\r\n\r\nWe know, on the other hand, that these “Mirrors” or “Specula” were, in\r\nthe earliest days of printing, so much in request, that in every place\r\nthe first printers rivalled each other in executing and publishing\r\ndifferent editions of the book with illustrations. Here, there was the\r\nreprint of the “Speculum,” abridged by L. Coster; there, the “Speculum”\r\nof Gutenberg, taken entirely from manuscripts; now it was the “Speculum\r\nVitæ Humanæ,” by Roderick, Bishop of Zamora; then the “Speculum\r\nConscienciæ,” of Arnold Gheyloven; then the “Speculum Sacerdotum,” or\r\nagain, the voluminous “Speculum” of Vincent de Beauvais, &c.\r\n\r\nIt cannot now any longer be assumed that Gutenberg really made mirrors\r\nor looking-glasses at Strasbourg, and that those pieces “laid in a\r\npress,” those “forms which came to pieces,” that lead sold or wrought by\r\na goldsmith, were, as they wished it to be supposed, only intended to be\r\nused “for printing ornaments on the frames of looking-glasses!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 394.--Interior of a Printing-office in the Sixteenth\r\nCentury, by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nWould it not have been surprising that the pilgrims who were to visit\r\nAix-la-Chapelle on the occasion of the grand jubilee of 1440, should be\r\nso anxious to buy ornamented mirrors? As to the art “_of polishing\r\nstones_,” which Gutenberg had taught at first to Andrew Dritzehen, who\r\nderived from it “_so much profit_,” having anything to do with printing\r\nwas, no doubt, also questionable; but we have not been able to solve the\r\nenigma, and wait to clear up the difficulty till a new _incunable_\r\n(_incunabula_, “a cradle,” the word is applied to the first editions\r\never printed) is discovered, the work of some Peter (πἑτρος “a stone”)\r\nor other; as, for example, the Latin sermons of Hermann de Petra on the\r\nLord’s Prayer; for Gutenberg, when speaking of _polishing stones_, might\r\nhave enigmatically designated a book he was printing; just as his\r\npartner, in answer to the judge, after having raised his hand on high\r\nand sworn to give true evidence, could call himself _a maker of\r\nmirrors_, without telling a falsehood, without committing perjury. The\r\nsecret of printing was to be religiously kept by those who knew it.\r\n\r\nIn short, it results from all this that Gutenberg, “an ingenious man and\r\na man of invention,” having seen a xylographie “Donatus,” had\r\nendeavoured to imitate it, and had succeeded in doing so, the secret\r\nbeing confided to Andrew Dritzehen; that the other _arts_, which\r\nGutenberg at first kept to himself, but which he subsequently\r\ncommunicated to his partners, consisted in the idea of substituting\r\nmovable type for tabular printing; a substitution that could only be\r\neffected after numerous experiments had been made, and which were just\r\nabout to be crowned with success when Andrew Dritzehen died. We may then\r\nconsider it as nearly certain that printing was in some sort discovered\r\ntwice successively--the first time by Laurent Coster, whose small\r\nprinted books, or books in letterpress (_en moule_), attracted the\r\nattention of Gutenberg; and the second time by Gutenberg, who raised the\r\nart to a degree of perfection such as had never been attained by his\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\nIt was after the Strasbourg lawsuit between the years 1440 or 1442, as\r\nstated by many historians, that Gutenberg went to Holland, and there\r\nbecame a workman in the establishment of Coster; this is asserted in\r\norder that they might be able to accuse him of the theft which Junius\r\nhas laid to the account of a certain man whose name was John. Only--and\r\nthe coincidence is not, in this case, unworthy of remark--two unedited\r\nchronicles of Strasbourg and the Alsatian Wimpfeling relate, almost at\r\nthe same time, a robbery of type and implements used in printing, but\r\nmentioning Strasbourg instead of Haarlem, Gutenberg instead of Laurent\r\nCoster, and naming the thief John Gensfieisch. But, according to the\r\nStrasbourg tradition, this John Gensfieisch the elder, related to and\r\nemployed by Gutenberg, robbed him of his secret and his tools, after\r\nhaving been his rival in the discovery of printing, and established\r\nhimself at Mayence, where, by a just visitation of Providence, he was\r\nsoon struck blind. It was then, adds the tradition, that in his\r\nrepentance he sent for his former master to come to Mayence, and gave up\r\nto him the business he had founded. But this last part of the tradition\r\nseems to savour too much of the moral deductions of a story; and as it\r\nis very improbable, moreover, that two thefts of the same kind were\r\ncommitted at the same period, and under the same circumstances, we are\r\ninclined to believe that the John mentioned by Junius was, in fact,\r\nGutenberg’s relative, who went to Haarlem to perfect himself in the art\r\nof printing, and robbed Coster; for there really existed at Mayence, at\r\nthe time mentioned, a John Gensfleisch, who might have printed, before\r\nGutenberg went to join him there, the two school books, “Doctrinale\r\nAlexandri Galli,” and “Petri Hispani Tractatus.” This is rendered still\r\nmore probable from the fact that, after search had been long made for\r\nthese books, which were absolutely unknown when Junius mentioned them,\r\nthree fragments of the “Doctrinale,” printed on vellum with the type of\r\nthe Dutch “Speculum,” were at length found.\r\n\r\nHowever, Gutenberg had not succeeded with his printing at Strasbourg.\r\nWhen he quitted the town, where he left such pupils as John Mentell and\r\nHenry Eggestein, he removed to Mayence, and established himself in the\r\nhouse of _Zum Jungen_. There he again printed, but he exhausted his\r\nmeans in experiments, alternately taking up and laying aside the various\r\nprocesses he had employed--xylography, movable types of wood, lead, and\r\ncast iron. He used, for printing, a hand-press which he had made on the\r\nsame principle as a wine-press; he invented new tools; he began ten\r\nworks and could finish none. At last, his resources all gone, and\r\nhimself in a state of despair, he was just going to give up the art\r\naltogether, when chance sent him a partner, John Fust or Faust, a rich\r\ngoldsmith of Mayence.\r\n\r\nThis partnership took place in 1450. Fust, by a deed properly drawn up\r\nby a notary, promised Gutenberg to advance him 800 gold florins\r\nfor the manufacture of implements and tools, and 300 for other\r\nexpenses--servants’ wages, rent, firing, parchment, paper, ink, &c.\r\nBesides the “Specula” and “Donati” already in circulation, which\r\nGutenberg probably continued to print, the object of the partnership was\r\nthe printing of a Bible in folio of two columns, in large type, with\r\ninitial letters engraved on wood; an important work requiring a great\r\noutlay.\r\n\r\nA caligrapher was attached to Gutenberg’s printing establishment, either\r\nto trace on wood the characters to be engraved, or to _rubricate_ the\r\nprinted pages; in other words, to write in red ink, to paint with a\r\nbrush or to illuminate (_au frottou_) the initials, the capital letters,\r\nand the headings of chapters. This caligrapher was probably Peter\r\nSchœffer or Schoiffer, of Gernsheim, a small town in the diocese of\r\nDarmstadt, a clerk of the diocese of Mayence, as he styles himself, and\r\nperhaps a German student in the University of Paris; since a manuscript\r\ncopied by him, and preserved at Strasbourg, is terminated by an\r\ninscription in which he testifies that he himself wrote it in the year\r\n1449, in “the very glorious University of Paris.” Schœffer was not only\r\na literary man, but was also a man of ingenuity and prudence\r\n(_ingeniosus et prudens_). Having entered Gutenberg’s establishment, on\r\nwhom Fust had forced him, in 1452, to take part in the new association\r\nthey were then forming, Schœffer invented an improved mould with which\r\nhe could cast separately all the letters of the alphabet in metal,\r\nwhereas up to this time they had been obliged to engrave the type with a\r\n_burin_. He concealed his discovery from Gutenberg, who would naturally\r\nhave availed himself of it; but he confided the secret to Fust, who,\r\nbeing very experienced in casting metals, carried out his idea. It was\r\nevidently with this cast type, which resisted the action of the press,\r\nthat Schœffer composed and executed a “Donatus,” of which four leaves,\r\nin parchment, were found at Treves in 1803, in the interior of an old\r\nbookcover, and were deposited in the Imperial Library of Paris. An\r\ninscription in this edition, printed in red, announces formally that\r\nPeter Schœffer alone had executed it, with its type and its initial\r\nletters, according to the “new art of the printer, without the help of\r\nthe pen.”\r\n\r\nThat was certainly the first public disclosure of the existence of\r\nprinting, which up to this time had passed off its productions as the\r\nwork of caligraphers. It seems that Schœffer thus desired to mark the\r\ndate and to appropriate to himself the invention of Gutenberg. It is\r\ncertain that Fust, allured by the results Schœffer had obtained,\r\nsecretly entered into partnership with him, and, in order to get rid of\r\nGutenberg, profited by the power which his bond gave him over that\r\nunfortunate individual. Gutenberg, summoned to dissolve the partnership\r\nand to return the sums he had received, which he was quite incapable of\r\npaying, was obliged, in order to satisfy the demands of his pitiless\r\ncreditor, to give up to him his printing establishment with all the\r\nmaterials it contained; among them was included this same Bible, the\r\nlast leaves of which were, perhaps, in the press at the moment when they\r\nrobbed him of the fruits of his long-protracted labours.\r\n\r\nGutenberg evicted, Peter Schœffer, and Fust, who had given Schœffer his\r\ndaughter in marriage, completed the great Bible, which was ready for\r\nsale in the early months of 1456. This Bible, being passed off as a\r\nmanuscript, must have commanded a very high price. This accounts for the\r\nnon-appearance on it of any inscription to show by what means this\r\nimmense work had been executed; let us add that in any case we may well\r\nsuppose Schœffer and Fust were not willing to give to Gutenberg a share\r\nof the glory which they dared not yet appropriate to themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 395.--Fac-simile of the Bible of 1456 (1 Samuel xix,\r\n1-5), printed at Mayence by Gutenberg.]\r\n\r\nThe Latin Bible, without date, which all bibliographers agree in\r\nconsidering as that of Gutenberg, is a large in-folio of six hundred and\r\nforty-one leaves, divided into two, or three, or even four volumes. It\r\nis printed in double columns, of forty-two lines each in the full pages,\r\nwith the exception of the first ten, which consisted of only forty or\r\nforty-one lines (Fig. 395). The characters are Gothic; the leaves are\r\nall numbered, and have neither _signatures_ nor _catchwords_. Some\r\ncopies of it are on vellum, others on paper. The number of copies which\r\nwere printed of this Bible may be estimated at one hundred and fifty--a\r\nconsiderable number for that period. The simultaneous publication of so\r\nmany Bibles, exactly alike, did not contribute less than the lawsuit of\r\nGutenberg and Fust to make known the discovery of printing. Besides\r\nwhich, Fust and his new partner, although they had mutually agreed to\r\nkeep the secret as long as possible, were the first to reveal it, in\r\norder to get all the credit of the invention for themselves, when public\r\nrumour allowed them no longer to conceal it within their\r\nprinting-office.\r\n\r\nIt was then they printed the “Psalmorum Codex” (Collection of Psalms),\r\nthe earliest book bearing their names, and which fixed, in a manner, for\r\nthe first time, a date for the new art they had so much improved. The\r\n_colophon_, or inscription at the end of the “Psalmorum Codex,”\r\nannounces that the book was executed “without the help of the pen, by an\r\ningenious process, in the year of our Lord, 1457.”\r\n\r\nThis magnificent Psalter, which went through three editions without any\r\nconsiderable alterations being made in it in the space of thirty-three\r\nyears, is a large in-folio volume of one hundred and seventy-five\r\nleaves, printed in red and black characters, imitated from those used in\r\nthe liturgical manuscripts of the fifteenth century. There exists,\r\nhowever, of the rarest edition of this book but six or seven copies on\r\nvellum (Fig. 396).\r\n\r\nFrom this period printing, instead of concealing itself, endeavoured, on\r\nthe contrary, to make itself generally known. But it does not as yet\r\nseem to have occurred to any one that it could be applied to the\r\nreproduction of other books than Bibles, psalters, and missals, because\r\nthese were the only books that commanded a quick and extensive sale.\r\nFust and Schœffer then undertook the printing of a voluminous work,\r\nwhich served as a liturgical manual to the whole of Christendom, the\r\ncelebrated “Rationale Divinorum Officiorum” (“Manual of Divine\r\nOffices”), by William Durand, Bishop of Mende, in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. It suffices to glance over this “Rationale,” and to compare it\r\nwith the coarse “Specula” printed in Holland, to be convinced that in\r\nthe year 1459 printing had reached the highest degree of perfection.\r\nThis edition, dated from Mayence (_Moguntiæ_), was no longer intended\r\nfor a small number of buyers; it was addressed to the entire Catholic\r\nworld, and copies of it on vellum and on paper were disseminated so\r\nrapidly over the whole of Europe as to cause the belief, thenceforward,\r\nthat printing was invented at Mayence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 396.--Fac-simile of a page of the Psalter of 1459,\r\nsecond edition, or the second copy that was struck off. Printed at\r\nMayence, by J. Fust and P. Schœffer.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth work printed by Fust and Schœffer, and dated 1460, is the\r\ncollection of the Constitutions of Pope Clement V., known by the name of\r\n“Clementines”--a large in-folio in double columns, having superb initial\r\nletters painted in gold and colours in the small number of copies still\r\nextant.\r\n\r\nBut Gutenberg, though deprived of his typographic apparatus, had not\r\nrenounced the art of which he considered himself, and with reason, the\r\nprincipal inventor. He was, above all, anxious to prove himself as\r\ncapable as his former partners of producing books “without the help of\r\nthe pen.” He formed a new association, and fitted up a printing-office\r\nwhich, we know by tradition, was actively at work till 1460, the year\r\nwherein appeared the “Catholicon” (a kind of encyclopædia of the\r\nthirteenth century), by John Balbi, of Genoa, the only important work\r\nthe printing of which can be attributed to Gutenberg (Fig. 397), and\r\nwhich can bear comparison with the editions of Fust and Schœffer.\r\nGutenberg, who had imitated the Dutch “Donati” and “Specula,” doubtless\r\nfelt a repugnance at appropriating to himself the credit of an invention\r\nhe had only improved; accordingly, in the long and explicit anonymous\r\ninscription placed at the end of the volume, he attributed to God alone\r\nthe glory of this divine invention, declaring that the “Catholicon” had\r\nbeen printed without the assistance of reed, _stylus_, or pen, but by a\r\nmarvellous combination of points, matrices, and letters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 397.--Fac-simile of the “Catholicon” at 1460,\r\nprinted at Mayence by Gutenberg.]\r\n\r\nThis undertaking brought to a happy termination, Gutenberg, no doubt\r\nweary of the annoyances incident to business, transferred his\r\nprinting-office to his workmen, Henry and Nicholas Bechtermuncze,\r\nWeigand Spyes, and Ulric Zell. Then, having retired near to Adolphus\r\nII., elector and archbishop of Mayence, where he occupied the post of\r\ngentleman of the ecclesiastical court of that prince, he contented\r\nhimself with the modest stipend attached to that office, and died at a\r\ndate not authentically determined, but which cannot be later than\r\nFebruary 24, 1468. His friend, Adam Gelth, erected in the Church of the\r\nRécollets at Mayence, a monument to his memory, with an epitaph styling\r\nhim formally “the inventor of the typographic art.”\r\n\r\nFust and Schœffer did not the less continue to print books with\r\nindefatigable ardour. In 1462 they completed a new edition of the Bible,\r\nmuch more perfect than that of 1456, and of which copies were probably\r\nsold, as were those of the first edition, as manuscripts, especially in\r\ncountries where, as in France, printing did not already exist. It seems\r\nthat the appearance in Paris of this Bible, (called the Mayence Bible),\r\ngreatly excited the community of scribes and booksellers, who saw in the\r\nnew method of producing books, _without the aid of the pen_, “the\r\ndestruction of their trade.” They charged, it is said, the sellers of\r\nthese books with magic; but it is more probable the latter were\r\nproceeded against, and condemned to fine and imprisonment, for having\r\nomitted to procure from the University authority for the sale of their\r\nBible; such permission being then indispensable for the sale of every\r\nkind of book.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the town of Mayence had been taken by assault and given\r\nup to pillage (October 27, 1462). This event, in consequence of which\r\nthe printing-office of Fust and Schœffer remained shut up for two years,\r\nresulted in the dissemination over the whole of Europe of printers and\r\nthe art of printing. Cologne, Hamburg, and Strasbourg appear to have\r\nbeen the first towns in which the emigrants established themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen these printers left Mayence, and carried their art elsewhere, it\r\nhad never produced any book of classic literature; but it had proved by\r\nimportant publications, such as the Bible and the “Catholicon,” that it\r\ncould create entire libraries, and thus propagate, _ad infinitum_, the\r\nmasterpieces of human genius. It was reserved for the printing-office of\r\nFust and Schœffer to set the example in that direction, and of printing\r\nthe first classical work. In 1465, Cicero’s treatise “De Officiis,”\r\nissued from the press of these two faithful associates, and marked, as\r\nwe may say, the commencement of the printing of books for libraries,\r\nand with so great success that in the following year a new edition of\r\nthe treatise was published, in quarto.\r\n\r\nAt this period, Fust himself came to Paris, where he established a dépôt\r\nof printed books, but left the management of the concern to one of his\r\nown fellow-countrymen. This person dying soon afterwards, the books\r\nfound in his house, being the property of a foreigner, were sold by\r\nright of forfeiture, for the king’s benefit. But upon the petition of\r\nPeter Schœffer, backed up by the Elector of Mayence, the King, Louis\r\nXI., granted to the petitioners a sum of 2,425 golden dollars, “in\r\nconsideration of the trouble and labour which the said petitioners had\r\ntaken for the said art and trade of printing, and of the benefit and\r\nutility which resulted and may result from this art to the whole world,\r\nas well by increasing knowledge as in other ways.” This memorable decree\r\nof the King of France bears date April 21, 1475.\r\n\r\nWe must mention, however, that about the year 1462, Louis XI.,\r\ninquisitive and uneasy at what he had heard of the invention of\r\nGutenberg, sent to Mayence Nicholas Jenson, a clever engraver, attached\r\nto the mint at Tours, “to obtain secret information of the cutting of\r\nthe points and type, by means of which the rarest manuscripts could be\r\nmultiplied, and to carry off surreptitiously the invention and introduce\r\nit into France.” Nicholas Jenson, after having succeeded in his mission,\r\ndid not return to France (it was never known why), but went to Venice\r\nand established himself there as a printer. It would seem, however, that\r\nLouis XI., not discouraged at the ill success of his attempt,\r\ndespatched, it is said, another envoy, less enterprising but more\r\nconscientious than the first, to discover the secrets of printing. In\r\n1469, three German printers, Ulric Gering, Martin Crantz, and Michael\r\nFriburger, began to print in Paris, in a room of the Sorbonne, of which\r\ntheir fellow-countryman, John Heylin, named De la Pierre, was then the\r\nprior; in the following year they dedicated to the king, “their\r\nprotector,” one of their editions, revised by the learned William\r\nFichet; and in the space of four years they published about fifteen\r\nworks, quartos and folios, the majority being printed for the first\r\ntime. Then, when they were forced to leave the Sorbonne, because John de\r\nla Pierre, who had returned to Germany, had no longer authority over the\r\ninstitution, they set up in the Rue Saint-Jacques a new printing\r\nestablishment, whose sign-board was the “Soleil d’Or,” from which,\r\nduring the next five years, were issued twelve other important works.\r\n\r\nThe Sorbonne then, like the University, was the cradle and the\r\nfoster-mother in Paris of the art of printing, which soon attained to a\r\nnourishing condition, and produced, during the last twenty years of the\r\nfourteenth[61] century, numerous fine books of history, poetry,\r\nliterature, and devotion, under the direction of the able and learned\r\nPierre Caron, Pasquier Bonhomme, Anthony Vérard, Simon Vostre (Fig.\r\n398), &c.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Mayence, two workmen, who had been dismissed from\r\nthe establishment of Fust and Schœffer, Conrad Sweynheim and Arnold\r\nPannartz, carried beyond the Alps the secret that had been confided to\r\nthem under the guarantee of an oath. They remained for a time in the\r\nConvent of Subiaco, near Rome, in which were some German monks, and\r\nthere they organised a printing apparatus, and printed many fine\r\neditions of Lactantius, Cicero, St. Augustine, &c. They were soon\r\ninvited to Rome, and met with an asylum in the house of the illustrious\r\nfamily of Massimi; but they found an opponent in the city in one of\r\ntheir own workmen from the convent, who had come to Rome and engaged\r\nhimself as printer to the cardinal John of Torquemada. Henceforward\r\nsprang up between the two printing establishments a rivalry which showed\r\nitself in unparalleled zeal and activity on both sides. In ten years the\r\ngreater number of the writings of the ancient Latin authors, which had\r\nbeen preserved in manuscripts more or less rare, passed through the\r\npress. In 1476 there were in Rome more than twenty printers, who\r\nemployed about a hundred presses, and whose great object was to surpass\r\neach other in the rapidity with which they produced their publications;\r\nso that the day soon arrived when the most precious manuscripts retained\r\nany value only because they contained what had not been already made\r\npublic by printing. Those of which printed editions already existed were\r\nso universally disregarded, that we must refer to this period the\r\ndestruction of a large number. They were used, when written on\r\nparchment, for binding the new books; and to this circumstance may be\r\nattributed the loss of certain celebrated works which printing in nowise\r\ntended to preserve from the knife of the binder.\r\n\r\nWhile printing was displaying such prodigious activity in Rome, it was\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 398.--Fac-simile of a page of a “Livre d’Heures”\r\nprinted in Paris, in 1512, by Simon Vostre.]\r\n\r\nnot less active in Venice, where it seems to have been imported by that\r\nNicholas Jenson whom Louis XI. had sent to Gutenberg, and whom for a\r\nlong time even the Venetians looked on as the inventor of the art with\r\nwhich he had clandestinely become acquainted at Mayence. From the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 399.--The Mark of Gérard Lecu, Printer at Gouwe\r\n(1482).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 400.--The Mark of Fust and Schœffer, Printers.\r\n(Fifteenth Century.)]\r\n\r\nyear 1469, however, Jenson had no longer the monopoly of printing in\r\nVenice, where John de Spire had arrived, bringing also from Mayence all\r\nthe improvements Gutenberg and Schœffer had obtained. This art having\r\nceased to be a secret in the city of the Doges, great\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 401.--Mark of Arnold de Keyser, Printer at Ghent.\r\n\r\n(1480.)]\r\n\r\ncompetition arose among printers, who flocked to Venice, where they\r\nfound a market for their volumes which a thousand ships carried to all\r\nparts of the world. At this period important and admirable publications\r\nissued from the numerous rival printing establishments in Venice.\r\nChristopher Waltdorfer, of Ratisbon, published in 1471 the first edition\r\nof the “Decameron” of Boccaccio, of which a copy was sold for £2,080 at\r\nthe Roxburgh sale; John of Cologne published, in the same year, the\r\nfirst dated edition of “Terence;” Adam of Amberg reprinted, from the\r\nRoman editions, “Lactantius” and “Virgil,” &c. Finally, Venice already\r\npossessed more than two hundred printers, when in 1494 the great Aldo\r\nManuzio made his appearance, the precursor of the Estiennes,[62] who\r\nwere the glory of French printing. From every part of Europe printing\r\nspread itself and flourished (Figs. 399 to 411); the printers, however,\r\noften neglected, perhaps intentionally, to date their\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 402.--Mark of Colard Mansion, Printer at Bruges.\r\n(1477.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 403.--Mark of Trechsel, Printer at Lyons. (1489.)]\r\n\r\nproductions. In the course of 1469 there were only two towns, Venice and\r\nMilan, that revealed, by their dated editions, the time at which\r\nprinting was first established within their walls; in 1470, five\r\ntowns--Nuremberg, Paris, Foligno, Treviso, and Verona; in 1471, eight\r\ntowns--Strasbourg, Spires, Treviso, Bologna, Ferrara, Naples, Pavia, and\r\nFlorence; in 1472, eight others--Cremona, Felizzano, Padua, Mantua,\r\nMontreuil, Jesi, Munster, and Parma; in 1473, ten--Brescia, Messina,\r\nUlm, Bude, Lauingen, Mersebourg, Alost, Utrecht, Lyons, and St. Ursio,\r\nnear Vicenza; in 1474, thirteen towns, among which are Valentia (in\r\nSpain) and London; in 1475, twelve towns, &c. Each year we find the art\r\ngaining ground, and each year an increase in the number of books newly\r\nedited, rendering science and literature popular by considerably\r\ndiminishing the price of books. Thus, for example, at the beginning of\r\nthe fifteenth century, the illustrious Poggio sold his fine manuscript\r\nof “Livy,” to raise money enough to buy himself a villa near Florence;\r\nAnthony of Palermo mortgaged his estate in order to be able to purchase\r\na manuscript of the same historical writer, valued at a hundred and\r\ntwenty-five dollars; yet a few years later the “Livy,” printed at Rome\r\nby Sweynheim and Pannartz, in one folio volume on vellum, was worth only\r\nfive golden dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 404.--Mark of Simon Vostre, Printer at Paris, in\r\n1531, living in the Rue Neuve Nostre-Dame, at the Sign of St. John the\r\nEvangelist.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 405.--Mark of Galliot du Pré, Bookseller at Paris.\r\n(1531.)]\r\n\r\nThe largest number of the early editions resembled each other, for they\r\nwere generally printed in Gothic characters, or _lettres de\r\nsomme_--letters which bristled with points and angular appendices. These\r\ncharacters, when printing was only just invented, had preserved in\r\nHolland and in Germany their original form; and the celebrated printer\r\nof Bruges, Colard Mansion, only improved on them in his valuable\r\npublications, which were almost contemporaneous with Gutenberg’s\r\n“Catholicon;” but they had already under-gone in France a semi\r\nmetamorphosis in getting rid of their angularities and their most\r\nextravagant features. These _lettres de somme_ were then adopted under\r\nthe name of _bâtarde_ (bastard) or _ronde_ (round), in the first books\r\nprinted in France, and when Nicholas Jenson established himself in\r\nVenice\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 406.--Mark of Philippe le Noir, Printer, Bookseller,\r\nand Bookbinder, at Paris, 1536, living in the Rue St. Jacques, at the\r\nsign of the “Rose Couronnée.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 407.--Mark of Temporal, Printer at Lyons, 1550-1559,\r\nwith two devices; one in Latin, “And in the meanwhile time flieth,\r\nflieth irreparably;” the other in Greek, “Mark, or know, Time.” (Observe\r\nthe play upon the words _tempus_, καιρὁς and Temporal.)]\r\n\r\nhe used the _Roman_, which were only an elegant variety of the _lettres\r\nde somme_ of France (Gothic characters). Aldo Manuzio, with the sole\r\nobject of insuring that Venice should not owe its national type to a\r\nFrenchman, adopted the _Italic_ character, renewed from the writing\r\ncalled cursive or _de chancellerie_ (of the chancellor’s office), which\r\nwas never generally used in printing, notwithstanding the fine editions\r\nof Aldo. Hereafter the Ciceronean character was to come into use, so\r\ncalled because it had been employed at Rome in the first edition of the\r\n“Epistolæ Familiares” (Familiar Letters) of Cicero, in 1467. The\r\ncharacter called “St. Augustinian,” which appeared later, likewise owes\r\nits name to the large edition of the works of St. Augustine, published\r\nat Basle in 1506. Moreover, during this first period in which each\r\nprinter engraved, or caused to be engraved under his own directions,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 408.--Mark of Robert Estienne, Printer at Paris,\r\n1536.\r\n\r\n“Do not aspire to know high things.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 409.--Mark of Gryphe, Printer at Lyons, 1529.\r\n\r\n“Virtue my Leader, Fortune my Companion.”]\r\n\r\nthe characters he made use of, there was an infinite number of different\r\ntypes. The _register_, a table indicative of the quires which composed\r\nthe book, was necessary to point out in what order these were to be\r\narranged\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 410.--Mark of Plantin, Printer, at Antwerp, 1557.\r\n\r\n“Christ the true Vine.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 411.--Mark of J. Le Noble, Printer at Troyes.\r\n(1595.)]\r\n\r\nand bound together. After the _register_ came _the catchwords_, which,\r\nat the end of each quire or of each leaf, were destined to serve an\r\nanalogous purpose; and the _signatures_, indicating the place of quires\r\nor of leaves by letters or figures; but signatures and catchwords\r\nexisted already in the manuscripts, and typographers had only to\r\nreproduce them in their editions. There was at first a perfect identity\r\nbetween the manuscripts and the books printed from them. The typographic\r\nart seems to have considered it imperative to respect the abbreviations\r\nwith which the manuscripts were so encumbered as often to become\r\nunintelligible; but, as it was not easy to transfer them precisely from\r\nthe manuscripts, they were soon expressed in such a way, and in so\r\ncomplicated a manner, that in 1483 a special explanatory treatise had to\r\nbe published to render them intelligible. The punctuation was generally\r\nvery capriciously presented: here, it was nearly _nil_; there, it\r\nadmitted only of the full stop in various positions; the rests were\r\noften indicated by oblique strokes; sometimes the full stop was round,\r\nsometimes square, and we find also the star or asterisk employed as a\r\nsign of punctuation. The new paragraphs, or breaks, are placed\r\nindifferently in the same line with the rest of the text, projecting\r\nbeyond it or not reaching to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 412.--Border from the “Livre d’Heures” of Anthony\r\nVérard (1488), representing the Assumption of the Virgin in the presence\r\nof the Apostles and Holy Women, and at the bottom of the page two\r\nMystical Figures.]\r\n\r\nThe book, on leaving the press, went, like its predecessor the\r\nmanuscript, first into the hands of the _corrector_, who revised the\r\ntext, rectifying wrong letters, and restoring those the press had left\r\nin blank; then into the hands of the _rubricator_, who printed in red,\r\nblue, or other colours, the initial letters, the capitals, and the new\r\nparagraphs. The leaves, before the adoption of signatures, were numbered\r\nby hand.\r\n\r\nAt first, nearly all books were printed in folio and quarto sizes, the\r\nresult of folding the sheet of paper in two or in four respectively; but\r\nthe length and breadth of these sizes varied according to the\r\nrequirements of typography and the dimensions of the press. At the end\r\nof the fifteenth century, however, the advantages of the octavo were\r\nalready appreciated, which soon became in France the sex-decimo, and in\r\nItaly the duo-decimo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 413.--Border taken from the “Livre d’Heures” of\r\nGeoffroi Tory (1525).]\r\n\r\nPaper and ink employed by the earliest printer seem to have required no\r\nimprovement as the art of printing progressed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 414--“Livre d’Heures,” by Guillaume Roville (1551),\r\na composition in the style of the school of Lyons, with Caryatides\r\nrepresenting female Saints semi-veiled.]\r\n\r\nThe ink was black, bright, indelible, unalterable, penetrating deeply\r\ninto the paper, and composed, as already were the colours, of oil-paint.\r\nThe paper, which was certainly rather grey or yellow, and often coarse\r\nand rough, had the advantage of being strong, durable, and was almost\r\nfit, in virtue of these qualities, to replace parchment and vellum, both\r\nof which materials were scarce and too expensive. Editors contented\r\nthemselves with having struck off on _membrane_ (a thin and white\r\nvellum) a small number of copies of each edition; never exceeding three\r\nhundred. These sumptuous copies, rubricated, illuminated, bound with\r\ncare, resembling in every respect the finest manuscripts, were generally\r\npresented to kings, princes, and great personages, whose patronage or\r\nassistance the printer sought. Nor was any expense spared to add to\r\ntypography all the ornaments which wood-engravings could confer upon it;\r\nand from the year 1475, numerous illustrated editions, of which an\r\nexample was found in the first “Specula,” especially those printed in\r\nGermany, were enriched with figures, portraits, heraldic escutcheons,\r\nand a multitude of ornamented margins (Figs. 412 to 415). For more than\r\na century the painters and engravers worked hand in hand with the\r\nprinters and booksellers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 415.--Border employed by John of Tournes, in 1557,\r\nornamented with Antique Masks and Allegorical Personages bearing Baskets\r\ncontaining Laurel Branches.]\r\n\r\nThe taste for books spread over the whole of Europe; the number of\r\nbuyers and of amateurs was every day increasing. In the libraries of\r\nprinces, scholars, or monks, printed books were collected as formerly\r\nwere manuscripts. Henceforth printing found everywhere the same\r\nprotection, the same encouragements, the same rivalry. Typographers\r\nsometimes travelled with their apparatus, opened a printing-office in a\r\nsmall town, and then went on elsewhere after they had sold one edition.\r\nFinally, such was the incredible activity of typography, from its origin\r\ntill 1500, that the number of editions published in Europe in the space\r\nof half a century amounted to _sixteen thousand_. But the most\r\nremarkable result of printing was the important part it played in the\r\nmovement of the sixteenth century, from which resulted the\r\ntransformation of the arts, of literature, and science; the discoveries\r\nof Laurent Coster and of Gutenberg had cast a new light over the world,\r\nand the press made its appearance to modify profoundly the conditions of\r\nthe intellectual life of peoples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 416.--Mark of Bonaventure and Abraham Elsevier,\r\nPrinters at Leyden, 1620.]\r\n\r\nLONDON: PRINTED BY VIRTUE AND CO., CITY ROAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Dorserets_, covers to backs of chairs, beds, &c.\r\n\r\n[2] Richard I., surnamed _Sans-peur_, third Duke of Normandy,\r\nwas natural son of William I., and grandson of Rollo. He died in\r\n996.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[3] Charles le Brun, a distinguished painter of the French school,\r\nflourished during the seventeenth century. The son of a sculptor, who\r\nplaced him under Simon Vouet, the young artist made such progress\r\nthat at the age of fifteen he painted a remarkable picture, “Hercules\r\nDestroying the Horses of Diomede,” which brought him at once into\r\npublic notice. Le Brun’s patron, the Chancellor Seguier, sent him to\r\nItaly, with an introduction to Nicholas Poussin, whose pure and correct\r\ntaste, however, seems to have had little influence on the French\r\nartist, who, though possessing an inventive and somewhat elevated\r\ngenius, often showed himself a mannerist.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[4] “Historical Topography of Ancient Paris in the district of the\r\nLouvre and Tuileries.” By Berty and Legrand.\r\n\r\n[5] Probably an abbreviation, or corruption, of\r\ncap-mail.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[6] Or _brassarts_--pieces to protect the upper part of the\r\narms.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[7] This title is not chronologically correct. Henry of Bolingbroke\r\nhad been created Duke of Hereford nearly a year before his intended\r\ncombat with Norfolk, at Coventry, in 1398; when the king, Richard II.,\r\ninterfered, and banished both nobles from the kingdom.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[8] _Anglicè_, partisan--a kind of pike or lance.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[9] _Martel-de-fer_--a weapon combining a hammer and pick; used by\r\ncavalry in the Middle Ages, to damage and destroy armour. It was\r\ngenerally hung at the saddle-bow.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[10] _Tassets_--parts of the cuirass.\r\n\r\n[11] _Morion_--a kind of helmet, usually worn by\r\nfoot-soldiers.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[12] So called, it may be presumed, from its form and\r\nmake.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[13] Latin, _Luteus_--muddy.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[14] Quincunx order is a method of arranging five objects, or pieces,\r\nin the form of a square; one being in the centre, and one at each\r\ncorner.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[15] _Limousine_--a term applied to enamelling, and derived, as some\r\nwriters assume, from Leonard Limousin, a famous artist in this kind of\r\nwork, resident at Limoges. It is, however, more probable it came from\r\nthe province Limousin, or Limosin, of which Limoges was the capital;\r\nand that Leonard acquired the surname of Limousin from his place of\r\nbirth or residence; just as many of the old painters are best known by\r\ntheirs.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[16] _Ogivale_--a term used by French architects to denote the Gothic\r\nvault, with its ribs and cross-springers, &c. It is also employed\r\nto denote the pointed arch.--GWILT’S _Encyclopædia of\r\nArchitecture_.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[17] This is a literal rendering of the text of M. Labarte; but the\r\nartists to whom allusion is made were only two, Niccola and Giovanni,\r\nsculptors and architects of Pisa. According to Vasari, Niccola, father\r\nof Giovanni (Jean or John), first worked under certain Greek sculptors\r\nwho were executing the figures and other sculptural ornaments of the\r\nDuomo of Pisa and the Chapel of San Giovanni.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[18] Andrea di Cione Orcagna.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[19] _Autochthone_--relating to the aboriginal inhabitants\r\nof a country: the use of the word here is not very intelligible.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[20] _Gnomon_--literally the upright piece of wood or metal which\r\nprojects the shadow on the plane of the dial.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[21] This clock, as many readers doubtless know, was removed\r\nsome years ago, when St. Dunstan’s Church, in Fleet Street, was\r\nrebuilt.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[22] The reader will notice a discrepancy between this description\r\nof the _chorus_ and that given in a preceding paragraph. We have\r\nretained both, mainly because it is now impossible to determine what\r\nthe instrument really was: no mention of it appears in any book we have\r\nconsulted.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[23] _Nabulum_--a name evidently derived from the Hebrew word _nebel_,\r\ngenerally translated in the Scriptures as a psaltery.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[24] The Welsh or Scotch _Crwd_.--[TR.]\r\n\r\n[25] In German _Geige_, “fiddle.”--[TR.]\r\n\r\n[26] Henry IV., born at Pau, in the Béarn.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[27] The English “knave” is only our old equivalent for the German\r\n_knabe_, and had originally the same meaning of _servant_; it is also\r\nnearly similar in sense to the French _valet_.--[TR.]\r\n\r\n[28] _Paul, the Silentiary_, is so named from holding in the court of\r\nJustinian the office of chief of the Silentiarii, persons who had the\r\ncare of the palace. He wrote a poem on the rebuilding of St. Sophia,\r\nat Constantinople, which was translated from Greek into Latin, and\r\npublished with notes, by Du Cange, of Paris, in 1670. It is this to\r\nwhich M. Lecroix refers in the text.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[29] _Amandaire_--almond-shaped. Strictly speaking, the aureola is the\r\nnimbus of the whole body, as the nimbus is the aureola of the head. In\r\nFairholt’s “Dictionary of Terms in Art” is an engraving showing a saint\r\nstanding in the centre of an almond-shaped aureola--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[30] _Grisaille_--white and black.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[31] Probably Alfonso is thus designate!.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[32] This is obviously a misconception. Lanzi, alluding to the\r\npicture, says, “Had Leonardo desired to follow the practice of his\r\nage in painting in distemper, the art at this time would have been in\r\npossession of this treasure. But being always fond of attempting new\r\nmethods, he painted this masterpiece upon a peculiar ground, formed of\r\ndistilled oils, which was the reason that it gradually detached itself\r\nfrom the wall,” &c. And a later authority, Kugler, thus writes: “The\r\ndetermination of Leonardo to execute the work in oil-colours instead of\r\nfresco, in order to have the power of finishing the minutest details in\r\nso great an undertaking, appears to have been unfortunate.” Distemper\r\ndiffers from fresco in that it is painted on a dry, and not a damp,\r\nwall; but in both the vehicle used is of an aqueous, and not an oily,\r\nnature.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[33] Deacon of the Church at Aquila, and afterwards attached to\r\nthe court of Charlemagne. Paul, who died about the year 799, was\r\ndistinguished as a poet and historian.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[34] Or San-Gemignano, a small town between Florence and\r\nSiena.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[35] Giorgione studied under Giovanni Bellini, younger brother of\r\nGentile, and son of Jacopo. M. Lacroix does not even mention Giovanni\r\nBellini, though he is generally esteemed before his father and brother,\r\nbesides being the master of two of the greatest painters of the\r\nVenetian school, Titian and Giorgione; who, however, soon cast aside\r\nthe antiquated style of their early instructor.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[36] The famous picture, an altar-piece, representing “Christ bearing\r\nhis Cross,” known by the name of _Lo Spasimo di Sicilia_, from its\r\nhaving been painted for the convent of Santa Maria della Spasimo at\r\nPalermo, in Sicily. It is now in the Museum of Madrid.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[37] We can find no authority to support this statement.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[38] Holbein died of the plague which prevailed in London in\r\n1554.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[39] This name is generally written Jeannet, and, according to Wornum’s\r\n“Epochs of Painting,” seems to have been applied indiscriminately\r\nalmost to the two painters, Jehannet or Jehan Clouet, father and\r\nson. M. Lacroix appears also to include François under the same\r\ngeneral cognomen; which, indeed, appears to have been a species of\r\nsurname.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[40] _Buziack_ is the name by which this old wood-engraver is generally\r\nknown.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[41] The legend which accompanies this engraving is in old Italian;\r\nit relates to the famous prophecy of Isaiah as to the birth of Christ\r\n(Isaiah vii. 14).\r\n\r\n[42] We presume this plate to be that commonly known among collectors\r\nof prints as “Death’s Horse;” it represents a knight on horseback\r\nfollowed by Death. The best impressions of this plate are prior to the\r\ndate 1513. It is also called “The Christian Knight,” and “The Knight,\r\nDeath, and the Devil.”--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[43] That Marc Antonio studied painting under Raphael, as is here\r\nimplied, is more than doubtful, though he engraved a very large number\r\nof his various compositions, and was highly esteemed by the great\r\nmaster.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[44] Giovanni B. B. Ghisi; Giorgio and Adams, his two sons; and Diana,\r\nhis daughter.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[45] This engraver, generally known by the single name of\r\nGeorge, usually signed his plates with the surname Peins or\r\nPentz.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[46] He was born at Prague, although most of his works were executed in\r\nEngland.--[TR.]\r\n\r\n[47] Ambons--a kind of pulpit in the early Christian\r\nchurches.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[48] Strasbourg spire is 468 feet in height, the highest in the world.\r\nAmiens, the next, a mere _flèche_, is 422 feet.--[TR.]\r\n\r\n[49] M. Lacroix uses the word _Romane_ throughout, with reference\r\nto this style of architecture: we have adopted _Norman_ as that\r\nmost commonly associated with it, and because it is a generic term\r\ncomprehending Romanesque, Lombardic, and even Byzantine.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[50] _Oculus_ (eye).--This word is not known in the vocabulary of\r\nEnglish architects; but it is evidently intended to signify a circular\r\nwindow.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[51] Officers who had jurisdiction over, and were inspectors of, works\r\nof masonry and carpentry.\r\n\r\n[52] The word is derived from _vellus_, which merely signifies the skin\r\nof any beast, not of a calf only.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[53] The word is derived from the Latin _uncialis_, and is applied to\r\nletters of a round or hook-shaped form: such were used by the ancients\r\nas numerals, or for words in abbreviated inscriptions.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[54] _Minuscule._--Less or little. The term is evidently here intended\r\nto distinguish small letters from capitals.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[55] _Palimpsest_--a kind of parchment from which anything written\r\ncould easily be erased.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[56] Librarian probably; though _libraire_ means only a bookseller,\r\n_bibliothécaire_ being the French for a librarian.--[TR.]\r\n\r\n[57] _Translation_: “This is Monseigneur St. Louis’ Psalter, which\r\nbelonged to his mother.”\r\n\r\n[58] _Antiphonaries_--books containing the responses, &c., used in\r\nCatholic church-services.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[59] “Garni de deux fermaulx d’argent, dorez, armoiez d’azur à une\r\naigle d’or à deux testes, onglé de gueulles, auquel a ung tuyau\r\nd’argent doré pour tourner les feuilles, à trois escussons desdites\r\narmes, couvert d’une chemise de veluyau vermeil.”\r\n\r\n[60] Probably this “pilgrimage” refers to some one of the great\r\nEuropean Councils or Diets held in the city during the Middle Ages, as\r\nwere Congresses in later times.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[61] _Sic_; but it should evidently be the fifteenth\r\ncentury.--[ED.]\r\n\r\n[62] _Anglicè_, Stephens, by which name this illustrious family of\r\nscholars and printers is most popularly known in England. They were ten\r\nin number, who flourished between 1512 and about 1660. Anthony, the\r\nlast distinguished representative of the family, died in poverty at the\r\nHôtel Dieu, Paris, in 1674, at the age of eighty-two.--[ED.]",
