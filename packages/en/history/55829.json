Justins, Printer, 41, Brick Lane, Spitalfields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe growing interest of Spanish and Portuguese Literature would,\r\nperhaps, be thought a sufficient reason for laying the following\r\ntranslation before the public, were the merits of the original work\r\neven less conspicuous, and the deficiency it appears fitted to supply\r\nin our language less sensibly felt. It is, indeed, extraordinary, that\r\nno similar work has hitherto appeared in a country, where the subject\r\nof which this history treats, has, in the instances in which it has\r\nbeen partially explored, always been found a rich source of pleasure\r\nand instruction. But the information thus collected from the literary\r\nstores of Spain and Portugal, however satisfactory on particular\r\npoints, is, from its nature, detached and incomplete, and seems\r\ncalculated to increase rather than to diminish the desire for such a\r\nconnected and comprehensive view of the whole subject as M. Bouterwek\r\nhas exhibited in his General History of Modern Literature.\r\n\r\nThe following volumes on the literature of Spain and Portugal\r\nare extracted from a work, entitled, _Geschichte der Poesie und\r\nBeredsamkeit seit dem Ende der dreizehnten Jahrhunderts_, (History of\r\nPoetry and Eloquence from the close of the thirteenth Century,) in\r\nwhich M. Bouterwek has taken an historical and critical survey of the\r\nliterature of the principal nations of Europe. The work consists of\r\ntwelve volumes, published at different periods at Göttingen; the first\r\nvolume having appeared in 1805, and the last, which contains an index\r\nto the whole, in 1819.[1] The two volumes now translated are the third\r\nand fourth of the German original.\r\n\r\nIf it be admitted that there remains in English literature a vacant\r\nplace which ought to be occupied by a work of this kind, it is not\r\napprehended that the means now resorted to for filling up the chasm\r\nwill be disapproved; at least the translator is not aware that any\r\nbetter source could have been found for supplying the deficiency. In\r\nvain, she is persuaded, would any substitute be sought for in French,\r\nmuch as that language abounds in works of criticism. Sismondi in his\r\n_Litterature du Midi de l’Europe_, implicitly adopts the judgments\r\npassed by Bouterwek on Spanish and Portuguese literature; and indeed\r\nwith respect to that part of his subject he says very little of\r\nimportance that is not directly borrowed from the German critic.[2]\r\nThe _Essai sur la Litterature Espagnole_, published in Paris in 1810,\r\nand which appears to have been well received by the French public, is\r\na gross plagiarism. It is, with some slight additions, merely the\r\ntranslation of an anonymous English work, entitled, _Letters from\r\nan English Traveller in Spain_, the epistolary form being dropped,\r\nand the materials transposed for the purpose of concealing the\r\ntheft.[3] The work of M. Bouterwek belongs, however, to a superior\r\nclass. To say that M. Bouterwek has treated his subject with great\r\nperspicuity and precision, would be to express only a small portion of\r\nhis merits. Extensive and laborious as his enquiries have evidently\r\nbeen, his judgment in the management of his materials is still more\r\nremarkable than the indefatigable research with which they must have\r\nbeen obtained. He has not confined himself to a mere narrative of the\r\nprogress and an exemplification of the beauties and deformities of\r\nthe literature of which he is the historian.--The philosophic spirit\r\nwhich pervades his criticism was not to be circumscribed within such\r\nnarrow bounds. He seeks in the structure of society, the habits of the\r\npeople, and the influence of events, for the causes of the intellectual\r\nphenomena he has to describe; and he examines with great candour and\r\nimpartiality the effects of mis-government and arbitrary institutions\r\non poetic genius and literary taste. Impressed with this favourable\r\nopinion of the work, the translator has endeavoured to give a true\r\nrepresentation of its contents. In undertaking the translation, her\r\nwish was to preserve the character of the original, as far as possible,\r\nunder an English dress. She began the task with an anticipation of its\r\ndifficulty, and she ends it with a consciousness of the indulgence of\r\nwhich her labours stand in need; but at the same time with the hope\r\nthat she will not be found to have altogether failed in the object she\r\nhad in view.\r\n\r\nThe first of the following volumes is devoted to the history of\r\nSpanish, and the second to the history of Portuguese Literature. The\r\nsubdivisions of the work correspond with periods marked out by certain\r\nrevolutions in taste, produced by the rise of eminent writers, or by\r\nother influential circumstances. These epochs in literary cultivation\r\nform convenient resting places for the student, and contribute to\r\nexhibit in a clear point of view the circumstances by which the\r\nadvancement of polite learning has been accelerated or retarded.\r\nThe specimens, which are numerous, and a great portion of which are\r\nselected from very scarce works, cannot fail to prove highly acceptable\r\nto the lovers of the literature of Spain and Portugal. For a general\r\nand comprehensive knowledge of that literature they will be found amply\r\nsufficient, and to those who wish to pursue its study more in detail,\r\nthey will afford most useful assistance. In such a course of study,\r\ngreat advantage may also be derived from the numerous bibliographical\r\nnotes which the author has introduced, and which are therefore\r\nscrupulously retained in the translation.\r\n\r\nThe translator at first intended to give literal versions of all the\r\nspecimens extracted from Spanish and Portuguese authors; but had she\r\npersisted in this plan, the translation could not have been completed\r\nwithout augmenting the price of the publication much beyond the rate\r\nto which the publishers were of opinion it ought to be limited. To\r\nhave omitted a part of the extracts in order to give translations of\r\nthe rest would have been still more improper, for the extracts quoted\r\nin the notes are all necessary to the illustration of the text; and\r\nbesides such a mutilation would have deprived the work of a merit\r\nwhich has just been pointed out, namely, that of supplying sufficient\r\nmaterials for a comprehensive study of the literature of Spain and\r\nPortugal. The translator has it, however, in contemplation, to prepare\r\nfor the press a volume containing translations of the specimens\r\ngiven by M. Bouterwek, and of some other pieces from the Spanish and\r\nPortuguese languages. This volume will not form a mere appendix to the\r\nvolumes now published; an endeavour will be made to render it useful\r\nand entertaining as a separate work.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to observe, that the History of Italian Literature,\r\nwhich is sometimes referred to in the notes, is a part of M.\r\nBouterwek’s General History of Poetry and Eloquence. It forms the\r\ntwo first volumes of the German work; some other parts of which the\r\ntranslator will be prepared to send to the press, should the merits of\r\nthe original procure from the public a favourable reception for these\r\nvolumes on Spanish and Portuguese Literature.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that the translator had considerable assistance in\r\nreading and revising the proofs, she regrets to find that still further\r\ncorrection would have been desirable. Fortunately, however, there are\r\nfew errors in the Spanish and Portuguese extracts; and those which do\r\noccur in the English text, will be found to be in general of a literal\r\nor obvious nature, altogether incapable of misleading the intelligent\r\nreader. Of the mistakes of the press which have been observed, tables\r\nof errata are made. If there are others, the translator is confident,\r\nthat the persons who are the best able to correct such faults, will be\r\nthe most ready to pardon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\nVOL.

More than five hundred years\r\nhad elapsed since the battle of Xerez de la Frontera;[4] and the\r\nMoors, who, by the result of that conflict, obtained the dominion of\r\nthe greater part of Spain and Portugal, had, by the repeated victories\r\nof the Christians, been, in their turn, driven back to the southern\r\nextremity of the country, and were obviously not destined to maintain\r\nthemselves much longer even in that quarter.\r\n\r\nDuring these five centuries of almost uninterrupted warfare between the\r\nrace of Moorish Arabs and the Christians of ancient European descent,\r\nboth parties, notwithstanding that their reciprocal hostility was\r\ninfluenced by fanaticism, had unconsciously approximated in mind and\r\nin manners. The intervals of repose, which formed short links in the\r\nchain of their sanguinary conflicts, afforded them some opportunities\r\nfor the interchange of the arts of peace, and they were soon taught to\r\nfeel for each other that involuntary respect which the brave can never\r\nwithhold from brave adversaries. Love adventures, in which the Moorish\r\nknight and Christian lady, or the Christian knight and Moorish lady,\r\nrespectively participated, could not be of rare occurrence. The Arab,\r\nwho, in his native deserts, had not been accustomed to impose on women\r\nhalf the despotic restraints to which the sex is subject in the harems\r\nof Mahometan cities, was soon disposed to imitate the gallantry of the\r\ndescendants of the Goths; and still more readily did the imagination of\r\nthe Christian knight, in a climate which was far from being ungenial,\r\neven to African invaders, acquire an oriental loftiness. Thus arose\r\nthe spirit of Spanish knighthood, which was, in reality, only a\r\nparticular form of the general chivalrous spirit then prevailing in\r\nmost of the countries of Europe, but which, under that form, impressed\r\nin an equal degree, on the old European Spaniard an oriental, and on\r\nthe Spanish Moor a European character.\r\n\r\nIn the first period of this long contest the Arabs carried learning\r\nand the arts to a degree of cultivation far beyond any thing known in\r\nthe Christian parts of Spain. Those wild enthusiasts learned, on the\r\nEuropean soil, to estimate the value of civilized life with a rapidity\r\nas astonishing as that which distinguished the social improvement of\r\ntheir brethren, whom they had left behind in Asia, under the government\r\nof the Caliphs. Before the era of Mahomet, their language had been\r\ncultivated and adapted to poetry and eloquence, according to the laws\r\nof oriental taste. In Spain, it soon acquired, even among the conquered\r\nChristians, the superiority over the barbarous _Romance_, or dialect\r\nof the country, which was then governed by no rule: for in the eighth\r\ncentury, when the Moors penetrated into Spain, the Visigoths, who had\r\nbeen masters of the territory since the fifth century, were not yet\r\ncompletely intermixed by matrimonial alliances with the _Provincials_,\r\nor descendants of the Roman subjects; and the new national language,\r\nwhich had grown out of a corrupt latin, was still the sport of\r\naccident. The conquered Christians, in the provinces under Moorish\r\ndominion, soon forgot their Romance. They became, indeed, so habituated\r\nto the Arabic, that, according to the testimony of a bishop of Cordova,\r\nwho lived in the ninth century, out of a thousand Spanish Christians,\r\nscarcely one was to be found capable of repeating the latin forms of\r\nprayer, while many could express themselves in Arabic with rhetorical\r\nelegance, and compose Arabic verses.[5]\r\n\r\nBut the Christians who had preserved their independence, descending\r\nfrom the mountains of the Asturias, began to repel the invaders, and\r\nin proportion as they extended their conquests, a wider field was\r\nopened for the Spanish tongue. It remained, nevertheless, long barren\r\nand rude, and was destined to receive many additions from the rich and\r\nelegant Arabic, before it attained the copiousness requisite for the\r\nwants even of common life.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances, however, under which the dialects of the several\r\nprovinces existed, did not present those facilities for an improved\r\nnational language, on the principle of the Italian _Volgare illustre_,\r\nof the age of Dante, which would have enabled a poet of Dante’s\r\ngenius, had such then arisen in Spain, to form out of them one general\r\nliterary language for all the Christian states of the Peninsula. It\r\nhappened, singularly enough, that about the beginning of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, the three principal idioms which were spoken from the coast\r\nof the Atlantic to the Pyrenees, and from the Bay of Biscay to the\r\nMediterranean, were represented by three kingdoms perfectly independent\r\nof each other. The Castilian prevailed exclusively only in the Castiles\r\nand Leon, the latter of which was permanently united to the former in\r\nthe year 1230. The Portuguese was spoken both by the court and the\r\npeople of Portugal. In the kingdom of Arragon, the language in general\r\nuse was the Catalonian, a dialect nearly the same as the Provençal\r\nor Limosin of the south of France, but differing greatly both from\r\nthe Castilian and the Portuguese. This language also extended to\r\nthe little kingdom of Navarre, but it was there spoken only by the\r\nnobles, who were of French or Hispano-Gothic origin. The great body\r\nof the population in Navarre spoke the ancient Cantabrian, called\r\nBASKIAN, VASKIAN, or BISCAYAN, and which\r\nstill exists in the Pyrenees and in the Spanish province of Biscay.\r\n\r\nThe trouble will be repaid if a glance be now cast on the map, in order\r\nto distinguish, with somewhat more precision than is usually thought\r\nnecessary, the respective domains of the three principal dialects of\r\nthe Spanish tongue; for it would be very difficult, if not impossible,\r\nto form any opinion on the contest maintained between the Spaniards and\r\nthe Portuguese relative to the value of their respective languages,\r\nand the influence which the merits or demerits of these languages have\r\nhad on the polite literature of both countries, without a knowledge\r\nof the geographical boundaries, which, previously to the political\r\ndivisions, separated the Portuguese from the Castilians, and the\r\nlatter from the Arragonese. In these questions the Biscayan language\r\nis of no consideration, as it has only an accidental and unimportant\r\nconnexion with the other Spanish dialects, and, besides, bears not the\r\nmost remote resemblance to them.[6]\r\n\r\nThe mutilated latin spoken along the Mediterranean on the Spanish\r\nshore, from the Pyrenees as far as Murcia, appears to have resolved\r\nitself, before the period of the Arabian invasion, into the same\r\nlanguage which extended eastward from the Pyrenees through the whole\r\nof the south of France to the Italian frontiers, and which, according\r\nto the most remarkable of its provincial forms, was called the\r\nCATALONIAN, the VALENCIAN, the LIMOSIN,\r\nand the PROVENÇAL. Of all the tongues spoken in modern\r\nEurope, this language of the coasts was the first cultivated. In it\r\nthe Troubadours sang, and their lays had all the same character,\r\nwhether addressed to the Italians, the French, or the Spaniards. From\r\nCatalonia it probably spread itself along the chain of the Pyrenees.\r\nThe kingdom of Arragon became, after the restoration of the Spanish\r\nromance in that quarter, its second country; for there both it and the\r\npoetry of the Troubadours were particularly favoured by the princes\r\nand the nobles. But at the very period of the decline of this poetry,\r\nthe kingdom of Arragon was united to the Castilian dominions. Another\r\nkind of poetry, in the Castilian language, then obtained encouragement,\r\nand the seat of the government of the united kingdoms was permanently\r\nfixed in Castile. The energetic development of literary talent among\r\nthe Castilians, the bold romantic character of that people, and that\r\nardent spirit of national pride which prompted them to make the most of\r\nall their advantages, soon banished the ancient and in other respects\r\nhighly esteemed dialect of Arragon, Catalonia, Valencia, and Murcia,\r\nfrom literature, law, and the conversation of the superior classes\r\nof society. Finally, towards the middle of the sixteenth century the\r\nCastilian became, in the strictest sense of the word, the reigning\r\nlanguage of the whole Spanish monarchy.[7]\r\n\r\nThe Castilian tongue (_Lengua Castellana_), now called, by way of\r\ndistinction, the Spanish, doubtless had its origin before the Moorish\r\nconquest, in the northern and midland parts of the Peninsula. How far\r\nit had originally spread towards the south, it would not now be easy\r\nto determine; but it came down from the Asturian mountains with the\r\nwarriors who boldly undertook to recover the country of their fathers.\r\nIt first resumed its sway in the kingdoms of Leon and old Castile,\r\nwhere it is still spoken in the greatest purity.[8] It then followed\r\nstep by step, the fortune of the Castilian arms, until it finally\r\nbecame the established language of the most southern provinces, where\r\nits progress had been longest withstood by the Arabic. More recently\r\ncultivated than the Catalonian, it cannot be doubted that it owes to\r\nthat dialect a part of its improvement; but the elevated expression of\r\nits long full-toned words, soon stamped on it the character of quite a\r\ndifferent kind of romance. The abbreviation of the latin words which\r\ngave the Catalonian language a striking resemblance to the French, was\r\nnot agreeable to the genius of the Castilian, which, in consequence\r\nof its clear sonorous vowels and the beautiful articulation of its\r\nsyllables, had, of all the idioms of the Peninsula, the greatest\r\naffinity to the Italian. Amidst the euphony of the Castilian syllables,\r\nthe ear is however struck with the sound of the German and Arabic\r\nguttural, which is rejected by all the other nations that speak\r\nlanguages in which the latin predominates.[9]\r\n\r\nThe romance, out of which the present Portuguese language has grown,\r\nwas probably spoken along the coast of the Atlantic long before\r\na kingdom of Portugal was founded. Though far more nearly allied\r\nto the Castilian dialect than to the Catalonian, it resembles\r\nthe latter in the remarkable abbreviation of words, both in the\r\ngrammatical structure and in the pronunciation. At the same time it\r\nis strikingly distinguished from the Castilian by the total rejection\r\nof the guttural, by the great abundance of its hissing sounds, and\r\nby a nasal pronunciation common to no people in Europe except the\r\nFrench and the Portuguese. In the Spanish province of Galicia, only\r\npolitically separated from Portugal, this dialect known under the name\r\nof _Lingoa Gallega_ is still as indigenous as in Portugal itself,\r\nand was at an early period, so highly esteemed, that Alphonso X.\r\nking of Castile, surnamed the Wise, (_El Sabio_,) composed verses in\r\nit. But the Galician modification of this dialect of the western\r\nshores of the Peninsula has sunk, like the Catalonian romance of the\r\nopposite coast, into a mere provincial idiom, in consequence of the\r\nlanguage of the Castilian court being adopted by the higher classes\r\nin Galicia.[10] Indeed the Portuguese language, which in its present\r\nstate of improvement must no longer be confounded with the popular\r\nidiom of Galicia, would have experienced great difficulty in obtaining\r\na literary cultivation, had not Portugal, which, even in the twelfth\r\ncentury, formed an independent kingdom, constantly vied in arts and\r\nin arms with Castile, and during the sixty years of her union with\r\nSpain, from 1580 to 1640, zealously maintained her particular national\r\ncharacter.[11]\r\n\r\nAfter accurately distinguishing these three principal idioms of the\r\nRomance, which formed the early spoken and written language of the\r\nPeninsula,[12] it will be more readily perceived why the Catalonian\r\nand Limosin poetry could not maintain itself in competition with the\r\nSpanish and Portuguese, which were of more recent growth, and why the\r\npoetry of Spain and that of Portugal have, from their first rise,\r\npreserved nearly the same character and passed through the same periods\r\nof splendour and decay. The Catalonian poetry was, from its origin,\r\ninseparably united with the language of the Troubadours, throughout\r\nits territories, from the Italian to the Castilian frontiers. While\r\nthe _Cours d’Amour_, the festal meetings, and various other gallant\r\nexhibitions prevailed, in which the GAYA CIENCIA, or Joyous\r\nArt, of these bards of love and chivalry flourished, and in which the\r\nbards themselves bore a brilliant part as masters of the ceremonies,\r\nthe language and the poetry gave reciprocal importance to each other.\r\nWhen, however, the romantic spirit had exhausted itself in these\r\nmodes, when another sort of gallantry came into vogue, and finally,\r\nwhen a more cultivated style of poetry, entirely new to Spain, was\r\nintroduced from Italy, and propagated with the Castilian language, the\r\npoets of Catalonia, Arragon, and Valencia began to write verses in the\r\nnew manner, and to disown their mother tongue in their compositions.\r\nThis literary phenomenon, which has its epoch only in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, cannot be attributed to political dependence alone; for\r\nhitherto the ancient national poetry of the Castilians had continued\r\nforeign to the inhabitants of the Arragonian provinces, individual\r\nimitators excepted, even after these provinces were united with the\r\nCastiles. But when the Arragonese, in their zeal to vie with the\r\nCastilians in the reform of their ancient poetry, began to write\r\nverses in the Castilian language, their success was facilitated by the\r\nrelationship which had long subsisted between the old Provençal poetry,\r\nthe sister of the Limosin, and the Italian, which in the sixteenth\r\ncentury became the model of the Spanish and Portuguese.[13]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Castilian poetry was as closely allied to the Portuguese\r\nand the Galician, as it was distinctly separated from the Limosin.\r\nThe Troubadours had, it is true, chaunted their lays at the courts of\r\nCastile and Portugal, but the national taste in both kingdoms preferred\r\ndifferent accents, other metrical combinations, and was accustomed to\r\nquite another kind of poetry of its own creation. No Troubadours were\r\nneeded in these countries; for the common national poetry, which was\r\nunknown to the Arragonian provinces, formed a connecting tie for the\r\nCastilians, Portuguese, and Galicians, as it was the faithful mirror\r\nof their genius and character. However much the Castilians might\r\ndislike the Portuguese tongue, and the Portuguese, in their turn,\r\nthe Castilian, their poetry continued essentially the same; and the\r\nlanguages of both countries deviated, at all times, far more from the\r\nLimosin romance, than ever they differed from each other. Besides, the\r\nold Galician idiom, which was scarcely distinguishable from the old\r\nPortuguese,[14] was originally a favourite with the Castilians; and\r\nwhen it ceased to be a literary language, the political conflicts of\r\nthe Spaniards and the Portuguese did not destroy the poetical harmony\r\nof the two nations. The Castilians, indeed, constantly maintained\r\nthe opinion, that the Portuguese language was incapable of giving\r\nappropriate expression to heroic sentiments; but the Portuguese\r\ncontradicted this assertion, not merely by words, but by deeds.[15]\r\n\r\nThe old Castilian, Portuguese, and Galician poetry was, under its own\r\npeculiar forms, still more popular and strictly national than was the\r\nProvençal, or than the Italian after it has ever been. It was not\r\ndestined to be recited in courtly circles, before lords and ladies.\r\nIt arose amidst the clang of arms, and was fostered by constantly\r\nreiterated relations of warlike feats and love adventures, transmitted\r\nfrom mouth to mouth; while almost every one who either witnessed\r\nor participated in those feats and adventures, wished to give them\r\ntraditional circulation in the vehicle of easy verse. So common was\r\nthe practice among all ranks of composing verses, particularly in\r\nPortugal, that the historian, Manuel de Faria y Sousa, thought himself,\r\nat a later period, justified in calling every mountain in that country\r\na Parnassus, and every fountain a Hippocrene.[16] The poems called\r\nRomances took their name from the national language; and it is probable\r\nthat the same name was at first given to all kinds of amatory and\r\nheroic ballads, the taste for which, however rapidly those productions\r\nincreased and supplanted each other, appears to have been insatiable.\r\nTo mark with critical precision the limits of the different species\r\nof poetic composition, was never contemplated by the authors of the\r\nRomances, but they very carefully distinguished, in their national\r\nverse, several kinds of measure and forms of rhyme, which differed\r\nwidely from the Provençal and Limosin; and having touched on this\r\nsubject, it will, perhaps, be most convenient here to introduce a brief\r\ndescription of the nature of the verse common to the ancient Castilian,\r\nPortuguese, and Galician poetry.\r\n\r\nOf the metrical compositions common to the ancient Castilians and\r\nPortuguese, the most peculiarly national were the REDONDILLAS.\r\nAll verses, consisting of four trochaic feet, appear to have been\r\noriginally comprehended under the name of _redondillas_,[17] which,\r\nhowever, came at length to be, in preference, usually applied to\r\none particular species of this description of verse. To a people\r\nso romantic and chivalrous, and at the same time so fond of their\r\nnational poetry, as the Spaniards and Portuguese, nothing could be\r\nmore agreeable than verses of this sort, which, in languages such as\r\ntheirs, could be composed on the spur of the occasion, and which to the\r\ncharm of simplicity add the beauty of a sonorous harmony.[18] It is\r\ndifficult to suppose that the redondillas have been formed in imitation\r\nof bisected hexameters, as some Spanish authors have imagined.[19]\r\nThey may, with more probability, be considered a relic of the songs\r\nof the Roman soldiers, which were doubtless often heard in these\r\ncountries, and which must have left recollections, the impressions of\r\nwhich would be easily communicated by the romanized natives to their\r\nconquerors, the Visigoths.[20] In such verses, every individual could,\r\nwithout restraint, pour forth the feelings which love and gallantry\r\ndictated, accompanied by his guitar; as little attention was paid to\r\ncorrectness in the distinction of long and short syllables as in the\r\nrhyme. When one of the poetic narratives, distinguished by the name\r\nof Romances, was sung, line followed line without constraint, the\r\nexpression flowing with careless freedom, as feeling gave it birth.\r\nWhen, however, romantic sentiments were to be clothed in a popular\r\nlyric dress, to exhibit the playful turns of the ideas under still\r\nmore pleasing forms, it was found advantageous to introduce divisions\r\nand periods, which gave rise to regular strophes (_estancias_ and\r\n_coplas_). Lines were, for the sake of variety, shortened by halving\r\nthem; and thus the tender and impressive melody of the rhythm was\r\nsometimes considerably heightened. Seduced by the example of the Arabs,\r\nsomething excellent was supposed to be accomplished when a single\r\nsonorous and unvarying rhyme was rendered prominent throughout all the\r\nverses of a long romance.[21] Through other romances, however, pairs\r\nof rhymeless verses were allowed to glide amidst a variety of rhymed\r\nones. At length, at a later period, it was observed, that in point of\r\nelegance, the _redondilla_ was improved, rather than injured by the\r\nchange which was produced; when, instead of perfect rhymes, imperfect\r\nones, or sounds echoing vowels but not consonants, were heard in the\r\nterminating syllables. Hence arose the distinction between _consonant_\r\nand _assonant_ verses, which has been cultivated into a rhythmical\r\nbeauty unknown to other nations.[22] Thus varied, and yet ever simple,\r\nthe redondilla has been still more valuable to Spanish and Portuguese\r\nversification, than the hexameter was to the poetry of Greece and Rome.\r\nIt has even become the prevailing measure of dramatic poetry.\r\n\r\nThe period of the invention of the redondillas was also nearly that\r\nof the dactylic stanzas, called _versos de arte mayor_, because their\r\ncomposition was considered an art of a superior order. They had their\r\norigin, according to some authorities, in Galicia and Portugal.[23]\r\nThis metrical form is, however, found in several of the most ancient\r\nCastilian poems. As the inventors of these stanzas were ignorant of the\r\ntrue principles of prosody, the attention paid to purity in the rhythm\r\nof the dactyles was even less than in the rhymes of the redondillas.\r\nThey contented themselves with dealing out eleven or twelve syllables,\r\nand left the dactylic measure to accident. This may account for these\r\nverses falling into disuse, as the progressive improvement of taste,\r\nwhich allowed the redondillas to maintain their original consideration,\r\nwas not reconcilable with the half dancing, half hobbling rhymed lines\r\nof the _versos de arte mayor_.[24]\r\n\r\nBesides the above national modes of rhythm and rhyme, common to\r\nCastilians, Galicians, and Portuguese, the form of the sonnet was also\r\nknown in the west of Spain and Portugal long before the imitation of\r\nItalian poetry was thought of in those parts of the Peninsula. It had\r\ndoubtless been acquired through the intervention of Provençal and\r\nLimosin poets. But the character of the sonnet was not sufficiently\r\npopular for the old Spaniards and Portuguese, and they were never fond\r\nof that kind of poetic composition. Not less adverse to the taste of\r\nthe country was the long protracted alexandrine. Monkish rhymesters,\r\nwho forced their imitations of latin doggrels on the nation, introduced\r\nthis kind of verse into the Spanish language, in the thirteenth or\r\nperhaps even in the twelfth century, but certainly at a period anterior\r\nto its appearance in any other modern tongue. It soon, however, sunk\r\ninto disesteem, and was neglected.\r\n\r\nThus, during the progress of their civilization, the Spaniards and\r\nthe Portuguese co-operated in cultivating the same spirit and form of\r\npoetry. What is, notwithstanding, dissimilar in the polite literature\r\nof the two countries, and what is peculiar to each, will, with other\r\nsubjects, become matter for consideration in the following sheets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nSPANISH LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nFROM THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SIXTEENTH\r\nCENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBABLE PERIOD OF THE FIRST ROMANCES.\r\n\r\nThe origin of Castilian poetry is lost in the obscurity of the middle\r\nages. The poetic spirit which then awoke in the north of Spain,\r\ndoubtless first manifested itself in romances and popular songs.\r\n_Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar_, called _El Campeador_, (the Champion), and\r\nstill better known by the Arabic title of the _Cid_, (the Lord or\r\nLeader), assisted in founding the kingdom of Castile for his prince,\r\nFerdinand I. about the year 1036, and the name and the exploits of\r\nthat favorite hero of the nation were probably celebrated during his\r\nown age in imperfect redondillas. That some of the many romances which\r\nrecord anecdotes of the life of the Cid may be the offspring of that\r\nperiod, is a conjecture which, to say the least of it, has never been\r\ndisproved; and indeed the whole character impressed upon Spanish poetry\r\nfrom its rise, denotes that the era which gave birth to the first songs\r\nof chivalry must be very remote. In the form, however, in which these\r\nromances now exist, it does not appear that even the oldest can be\r\nreferred to the twelfth, far less to the eleventh century.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOEMA DEL CID.\r\n\r\nSome examples of Old Castilian verse, which are held to be more\r\nancient than any known romance or ballad in that language, have been\r\npreserved.[26] Of these the rhymed chronicle, Of the Exile and Return\r\nof the Cid, (_Poema del Cid, el Campeador_), is considered the oldest.\r\nThis chronicle can scarcely be called a poem; and that it could not\r\nhave been the result of a poetic essay made in the spirit of the\r\nnational taste, is evident, from the nature of the verse, which is a\r\nkind of rude alexandrine. It is the more difficult to speak with any\r\ncertainty respecting its age, as there also exists a very old prose\r\naccount of the Cid, which corresponds in all the principal facts\r\nwith this rhymed chronicle. Though it may be true that the author\r\nlived about the middle of the twelfth century, as his editor Sanchez\r\nsupposes, still it is not with this work that the history of Spanish\r\npoetry ought to commence. As a philological curiosity, the rhymed\r\nchronicle is highly valuable; but any thing like poetry which it\r\ncontains must be considered as a consequence of the poetic character\r\nof the nation to which the versifier belonged, and of the internal\r\ninterest of the subject. The events are narrated in the order in which\r\nthey succeed each other, and the whole work scarcely exhibits a single\r\nmark of invention. The small portion of poetical colouring with which\r\nthe dryness of the relation is occasionally relieved, is the result\r\nof the chivalrous cordiality of the writer’s tone, and of a few happy\r\ntraits in the description of some of the situations.[27]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOEMA DE ALEXANDRO MAGNO.\r\n\r\nStill less of the character of poetry belongs to the fabulous chronicle\r\nof Alexander the Great (_Poema de Alexandro Magno_), respecting the\r\norigin and age of which the Spanish critics are far from being agreed.\r\nWhether it be, as some pretend, a Spanish original of the twelfth or\r\nthirteenth century, or as others assert, the translation of a French\r\nwork of the same age, in verse, or, what is still more probable, a\r\nversified translation of a latin legend, with the manufacture of which\r\nsome monk had occupied his solitary hours, are questions which a\r\nwriter of the history of Spanish poetry cannot, with propriety, stop\r\nto discuss, even though alexandrine verse should, as some suppose,\r\nhave taken its name from this chronicle. Next to stringing together\r\nhis rhymes,[28] the chief object of the author probably was to dress\r\nthe biography of Alexander the Great in the costume of chivalry.\r\nAccordingly he relates how the _Infante_ Alexander, whose birth was\r\ndistinguished by numerous prodigies, seemed, while yet a youth a\r\nHercules; how he was taught to read in his seventh year; how he then\r\nevery day learned a lesson in the seven liberal arts, and maintained\r\na daily disputation thereon; and many other wonders of this sort.[29]\r\nAlexander’s officers are counts and barons. The real history only\r\nfeebly glimmers through a grotesque compound of puerile fictions and\r\ndistorted facts. But perhaps this mode of treating the materials is not\r\nto be laid to the account of the versifier.\r\n\r\n\r\nGONZALO BERCEO.\r\n\r\nThere are some prayers, monastic rules, and legends in Castilian\r\nalexandrines, which are regarded as of very ancient date, but they\r\nwere probably composed by Gonzalo Berceo, a benedictine, about the\r\nmiddle of the thirteenth century. Spanish authors have made the dates\r\nof the birth and death of this monk objects of very minute research,\r\nand have exerted great industry in recovering his rude verses.[30] In\r\nthis field, however, the poetical historian can find nothing worth the\r\ngleaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nALPHONSO X.; HIS LITERARY MERITS--NICOLAS AND ANTONIO DE LOS\r\nROMANCES, &c.\r\n\r\nThe names of several early writers of rude Castilian verse are recorded\r\nby different authors. A notice, however, of the literary merits of\r\nAlphonso X. called the _Wise_, by which is meant the learned, forms\r\nthe most suitable commencement for a history of Spanish poetry. This\r\nsovereign, who was a very extraordinary man, for the age in which he\r\nlived, was ambitious, among his other distinctions, of being a poet.\r\nScarcely any romance or song of true poetic feeling can be attributed\r\nto him; but he loved to embody his science and learning in verse.\r\nHe disclosed his Alchymical Secrets in the dactylic stanzas, called\r\n_versos de arte mayor_. Alchymy was his favourite study; and if his\r\nassertions in verse may be relied on, he several times made gold, and\r\nin times of difficulty turned his power of producing that precious\r\nmetal to his own advantage. His verses are, in some degree, harmonious,\r\nand ingeniously constructed; but no trait of poetic description\r\nenlivens the dry and uninteresting precepts he details.[31] It is not,\r\ntherefore, on account of his rhymes that Alphonso the Wise deserves\r\nto be placed at the head of the Castilian poets. His claim to occupy\r\nthat station can only be founded on the attention he devoted to the\r\ncultivation of the Castilian language, an attention which is easily\r\nrecognized even in his unpoetic verses, and which could not fail to\r\nprove a most powerful incitement to emulation, since he who set the\r\nexample was the king of the country, and possessed a reputation for\r\nlearning which was flattering to the national pride. The greater\r\npurity and precision which was thus introduced into the dialect of\r\nCastile and Leon, enabled the poetic genius of the nation to unfold\r\nitself with increasing vigour and freedom. But the benefits which\r\nAlphonso conferred on the Spanish language and literature, did not\r\nstop here. The bible was, by his command, rendered into Castilian;\r\nand a Paraphrase of Scripture History accompanied the translation. A\r\nGeneral Chronicle of Spain, and a History of the Conquest of the Holy\r\nLand, founded on the work of William of Tyre, were also written by his\r\norder. Finally, he introduced the use of the national language into\r\nlegal and judicial proceedings. No direct interest was, however, taken\r\nby Alphonso in the improvement of the popular Castilian poetry. He\r\nprobably thought it too destitute of art and learning to deserve much\r\nconsideration. It appears to have been on this account, and not from\r\nvanity, that he favoured the Troubadours, assembled at his court, in\r\nwhose more elegant verse his praises were unceasingly proclaimed.[32]\r\nHis influence had an extensive operation; but his death, which happened\r\nin the year 1284, was no loss to the national bards of Castile, who\r\nstill sung their Romances in obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe history of Spanish poetry continues barren of names until towards\r\nthe end of the fourteenth century; and yet, according to all literary\r\nprobability, the greater part of the ancient Castilian romances, which\r\nhave, in the progress of time, been collected, and have undergone\r\nmore or less improvement, were composed at a much earlier period.\r\nOne Nicolas, and an abbot named Antonio, are mentioned as celebrated\r\nwriters of romances in the thirteenth century, anterior to the reign\r\nof Alphonso X.[33] But until the period of the invention of printing,\r\nno regard was paid by the learned, or by those who wished to be\r\nconsidered learned, to popular ballads; and when the attention of\r\nmen of letters began at last to be directed to the old romances, the\r\nauthors were either forgotten, or no trouble was taken to preserve or\r\nrecover their names. With a view, therefore, to the convenience of\r\nhistorical arrangement, a particular account of the ancient romance\r\npoetry of Castile may, with propriety, be postponed until the period\r\nwhen the first instance of literary publicity, which was given to it,\r\nmust be recorded. In the mean while, some little known, though not\r\nunimportant memorials of the state of poetical and rhetorical culture\r\nin the fourteenth century, may here be brought to recollection.\r\n\r\n\r\nALPHONSO XI.\r\n\r\nThat the example of Alphonso X. operated powerfully among the grandees\r\nof Castile, cannot be doubted; and to its influence must, in a great\r\nmeasure, be attributed the encouragement given to the cultivation of\r\nknowledge by Alphonso XI. This prince, amidst all the troubles of his\r\nbusy reign, maintained the character of a protector of learning, and\r\nendeavoured to distinguish himself as a writer in his native tongue.\r\nIn the accounts of his labours given by Spanish authors, he is stated\r\nto have composed a General Chronicle in Redondillas,[34] which is\r\neither lost, or still remains buried in some of the old archives of\r\nSpain. However slight may be the merits of this work, in a poetical\r\npoint of view, it is rendered interesting by the circumstance, that\r\nthe king chose for the rhythmic structure of his narrative, the easy\r\nflowing verse of the romances, instead of stiff monkish alexandrines,\r\nand the ungraceful dactylic stanzas. This brought the redondillas more\r\ninto favour. Alphonso XI. also caused books to be written in Castilian\r\nprose, among which were a kind of Peerage, or Register of the noble\r\nfamilies of Castile, with an account of their hereditary estates\r\nand possessions, and a Hunting Book, (_Libro de Monteria_,) in the\r\ncomposition of which several persons assisted. Though rhetorical art\r\nmight derive no advantage from these books, they contributed to give\r\nconsideration to the national dialect, and to incite persons of rank to\r\nengage in literary labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n    EARLY CULTIVATION OF CASTILIAN PROSE--DON JUAN MANUEL; HIS CONDE\r\n    LUCANOR; HIS ROMANCES.\r\n\r\nBut the most valuable monument of the cultivation of Spanish eloquence\r\nin the fourteenth century is _El Conde Lucanor_, a book of moral and\r\npolitical maxims, written by Don Juan Manuel, a Castilian prince.\r\nThis Don Juan was one of the most distinguished men of his age.[35]\r\nHe was descended, in a collateral line with the reigning family of\r\nCastile, from king Ferdinand III. usually called the SAINT.\r\nHe served his sovereign Alphonso XI. with chivalrous fidelity, and\r\nby the judicious policy of his conduct, retained the favour of that\r\nprince, who certainly had reason to regard him with jealousy. After\r\ndistinguishing himself by a number of honourable and gallant deeds,\r\nAlphonso appointed him governor (_adelantado mayor_) of the country\r\nbordering on the Moorish kingdom of Grenada. In this station he became\r\nthe terror of the hereditary enemy of Castile. He made an irruption\r\ninto Grenada, and defeated the Moorish king in a great battle. After\r\nthis brilliant victory, he always acted one of the first parts in\r\nthe internal troubles of Castile, and during twenty years conducted\r\nthe war against the Moors. He died in 1362, leaving behind him some\r\nof the ripest fruits of his experience in his _Count Lucanor_. A\r\nSpanish book, so full of sound practical good sense, of a character so\r\ntruly unostentatious, and clothed in a simple, homely, but far from\r\ninanimate garb, could scarcely be expected to belong to the fourteenth\r\ncentury. In estimating the merit of this work, it ought also to be\r\nrecollected, that at the period in which it appeared, the taste for the\r\nwild tales of chivalry called romances had begun to prevail. Amadis de\r\nGaul, the prototype of all subsequent knight-errantry romances, had\r\nthen obtained general circulation. There is, however, in the _Count\r\nLucanor_, no trace of romantic extravagance, none of the dreaming\r\nflights of an irregular imagination; for in every passage of the book\r\nthe author shews himself a man of the world and an observer of human\r\nnature. In the course of his long experience he had formed maxims for\r\nthe conduct of life which he was desirous of pursuing. He gave to many\r\nof these axioms a laconic expression in verse; and, to impress them\r\nthe more forcibly, invented his _Count Lucanor_, a prince conscious\r\nof too limited an understanding to trust to his own judgment in cases\r\nof difficulty. He gives the Count a minister (_consejero_), whose\r\nwisdom fortunately supplies the deficiency of his master’s intellect.\r\nWhen the Count asks advice of his minister, the latter relates a\r\nstory, or sometimes a fable. The application comes at the close, and\r\nthe narrative is the commentary of the verse or couplet with which\r\nit terminates. In this manner forty-nine moral and political tales\r\nare told. They are not of equal merit; but though some are inferior\r\nto others, the difference is not great, and they have all the same\r\nrhetorical form. Sometimes it is the idea that gives the chief\r\ninterest, sometimes the execution. Among the versified maxims are the\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n“If you have done something good in little, do it also in great, as the\r\ngood will never die.”[36]\r\n\r\n“He who advises you to be reserved to your friends, wishes to betray\r\nyou without witnesses.”[37]\r\n\r\n“Hazard not your wealth on a poor man’s advice.”[38]\r\n\r\n“He who has got a good seat should not leave it.”[39]\r\n\r\n“He who praises you for what you have not, wishes to take from you what\r\nyou have.”[40]\r\n\r\nThis last axiom is deduced from the well-known fable of the fox and the\r\nraven. It is curious to observe the resemblance between the unconscious\r\nartless simplicity with which Don Juan Manuel relates his fable, and\r\nthe finely-studied simplicity with which the elegant La Fontaine tells\r\nthe same story. Who would expect to find in an old Spanish book of the\r\nfourteenth century, the same knowledge of the world and mankind, as\r\ndistinguished the refined age of Louis XIV.[41]\r\n\r\nThis work appears to have been preserved without alteration, as it was\r\noriginally written. It is only occasionally that the difference of the\r\nlanguage in single words,[42] betrays the officious industry of some\r\ntranscriber. In a short preface, the author gives a candid explanation\r\nof the object of this collection of tales.\r\n\r\nDon Juan Manuel was also the author of a Chronicle (_Chronica de\r\nEspaña_); the Book of the Sages, (_Libro de los Sabios_); a Book of\r\nChivalry, (_Libro del Caballero_); and several other works in prose\r\nof a similar nature.[43] It appears that these works are now lost,\r\nthough they were preserved in manuscript in the sixteenth century.\r\nA collection of Don Juan Manuel’s poems also existed at that time,\r\naccording to the express testimony of Argote y Molina, who published\r\n_El Conde Lucanor_ in the sixteenth century, and intended to publish\r\nthose poems likewise. He calls them coplas; and they certainly were\r\nnot alexandrines. After this testimony, it can scarcely be doubted\r\nthat some of the romances and songs, which are attributed, in the\r\n_Cancionero general_, to a Don Juan Manuel, have this prince for their\r\nauthor.[44] But if such be the fact, then how many of the similar\r\nromances which are still preserved, may, considering the greater\r\nantiquity of their form, be yet more ancient!\r\n\r\n\r\nSATIRICAL POEM OF JUAN RUYZ, ARCH-PRIEST OF HITA.\r\n\r\nDon Juan Manuel had for his contemporary the author of an allegorical\r\nsatire, written in Castilian alexandrines, or in a kind of verse which\r\nmay be called doggrel. The result of the researches of the Spanish\r\ncritics ascribes this very singular work to Juan Ruiz, arch-priest\r\nof Hita, in Castile.[45] This writer evidently possessed a lively\r\nimagination; he has personified with great drollery Lent, the Carnival,\r\nand Breakfast, under the titles of _Doña Quaresma_, _Don Carnal_, and\r\n_Don Almuerzo_; and these and other personages are placed in a very\r\nedifying connection with _Don Amor_. The object of the satire is thus\r\napparent, but the execution is as unskilful as the language is rude.\r\nOnly a part of the work has been preserved.[46]\r\n\r\nHe, however, who has to record the developement of true poetic genius,\r\nmust hasten from this and other examples of monastic humour and rugged\r\nversification, in order to speak with something like historical\r\nprecision of the romances and other lyric compositions which form the\r\nreal commencement of Spanish poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MORE PRECISE ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE SPANISH POETIC\r\n    ROMANCES AND SONGS--PROBABLE RISE OF THE ROMANCES OF CHIVALRY IN\r\n    PROSE--ORIGINAL RELATIONSHIP OF THE POETIC AND THE PROSE ROMANCES.\r\n\r\nThe latter half of the fourteenth century is the period when the\r\nhistory of the Spanish romances and songs, the unknown authors of\r\nwhich yet live in their verse, though still very defective, begins\r\nto acquire some degree of certainty.[47] In the absence, however,\r\nof that particular information which would be desirable, it becomes\r\nnecessary to take a view of the manner of thinking of the Spaniards\r\nof that age, in order to connect the general idea which ought to be\r\nformed of their literary culture, with those scattered notices which\r\nmust supply the place of a more systematic account. It will here be\r\nrecollected that the cultivation of Spanish literature received at\r\nits commencement a national poetic impulse. In constant conflict with\r\nthe Moors, and acquainted with oriental manners and compositions, the\r\nSpaniards felt the proper distinction between poetry and prose, less\r\nreadily than that distinction was perceived by any other people on the\r\nfirst attempt to give a determinate form to their literature. Popular\r\nsongs of every kind were probably indigenous in the Peninsula. The\r\npatriotic Spaniards, like many other ancient nations, were fond of\r\npreserving the memory of remarkable events in ballads. They also began,\r\nat a very early period, to consider it of importance to record public\r\ntransactions in prose. The example of their learned king Alphonso X.\r\nwho caused a collection of old national chronicles to be made, gave\r\nbirth to many similar compilations of the history of the country.\r\nBut historical criticism, and the historical art, were then equally\r\nunknown. As the giving to an accredited fact a poetical dress in a\r\nsong fit to be sung to a guitar, was not thought inconsistent with the\r\nspirit of genuine national history, still less could the relating of a\r\nfabricated story as a real event in history seem hostile to the spirit\r\nof poetry. Thus the _historical romance_ in verse, and the _chivalric\r\nromance_ in prose, derived their origin from the confounding of the\r\nlimits of epic and historical composition. The history of Spanish\r\npoetical romance is therefore intimately interwoven with the history of\r\nthe prose chivalric romance.\r\n\r\nWhoever may have been the author of _Amadis de Gaul_, his genius lives\r\nin his invention; this work soon obscured, even in France, all the\r\nother histories of knights-errant written in latin or french, by many\r\nof which it had been preceded. From the very careful investigations\r\nof several Spanish and Portuguese writers, it appears that the name\r\nof the real author of the first or genuine Amadis was Vasco Lobeira,\r\nor, according to the Spanish orthography and pronunciation, Lobera,\r\na native of Portugal, who flourished about the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and lived to 1325. It is probable, however, that before the\r\nperiod at which the work obtained its highest celebrity both in Spain\r\nand France, it had passed through the hands of several emendators, and\r\nit is therefore impossible to know how much of the book, as it now\r\nexists, belongs to the original author, and how far it is indebted to\r\nthe labours of Spanish or French editors.[48] From these circumstances\r\ntoo, it appears that the work could scarcely be generally known in\r\nSpain before the middle of the fourteenth century; and its influence on\r\nthe national literature must, on that account, have been the greater;\r\nfor it would be operating with all the force of novelty, precisely at\r\nthe time when the poetic genius of the nation began to display itself\r\nin youthful vigour. What other book could have produced an effect so\r\nfascinating on the minds of the Spanish nobles, as Amadis de Gaul? The\r\nmonstrous perversions of history and geography in that work, did not\r\ndisturb the illusion of readers who knew little or nothing of either\r\nhistory or geography. The prolixity of the narrative gave as little\r\noffence as the stiff formality of the style. Indeed the virtues of\r\ngothic chivalry appear more pure as they shine through the formal\r\nstateliness of the narration. The author has borrowed nothing from\r\nthe Arabian tale-tellers, except the attraction of fairy machinery.\r\nThis was, however, a powerful charm, and gave an epic-colouring to\r\nthe Amadis, which, joined to the pathetic descriptions of romantic\r\nheroism, produced an influence over the imagination and feelings of\r\nthe age which no former work had possessed. The moral character of\r\nthe plan and execution is strangely blended with a peculiar kind of\r\ndelicately veiled licence, which appears to have very well accorded\r\nwith the spirit of Spanish chivalry. While the gentle knights, amidst\r\ninnumerable adventures of love and heroism, observe as the chief law\r\nof chivalry, the most inviolable fidelity in all situations towards\r\nfemales as well as males, they and the ladies with whom they have\r\npledged their faith, by a secret betrothing, live together without\r\nscruple before marriage, as husband and wife. But a picture, so true\r\nand glowing, of the noblest heroic feelings and the most unshaken\r\nfidelity,--circumscribing with no anxious care the boundaries of\r\nlove’s dominion, yet admitting no offensively indecorous or immoral\r\ntrait,--displaying the enthusiastic flights of an imagination often\r\nexalted beyond nature, but redeemed by an ingenuous simplicity of\r\ndescription with which even a refined taste must be delighted,--well\r\ndeserved at the time of its appearance that favour which it continued\r\nfor ages to enjoy. It is obvious that more of Spanish than of French\r\nfeatures enter into the character of the chivalry exhibited in this\r\nwork. The romantic self-torment of Amadis on the _Peña pobre_ (barren\r\nrock) is one of the striking Spanish traits. Even the name Beltenebros,\r\ngiven on this occasion by a pious hermit to the disconsolate knight,\r\ncontributes to prove that the work is not of French origin; for the\r\nFrench paraphrastic translation, _Le beau tenebreux_, is not only in\r\nitself very insipid, but poor Amadis appears quite ridiculous when made\r\nto pronounce it from his own mouth as his name.[49]\r\n\r\nWhen the Amadis, after being widely circulated, became the object\r\nof numerous imitations, the particular account of which may be left\r\nto the explorers of literary curiosities, it was no longer possible\r\nfor the prose romance of knight-errantry and the ballad romance\r\nto disown their relationship. At this period the romance poetry\r\nobtained a consideration which it had not previously enjoyed. Songs\r\nwhich were formerly disregarded were now carefully noted down. Those\r\npoetic romances, the materials for which are taken from histories of\r\nknights-errant, are among the oldest of the Spanish ballads which have\r\nbeen preserved in the ancient language and form. Some are imitations\r\nfrom the Spanish Amadis, others are translations from the French; and\r\nit may here be observed, that the Spaniards and the French possessed\r\nat this period a body of romantic literature, which was throughout\r\nits whole extent nearly the same to both countries.--With the old\r\npoetic romances, derived from books of chivalry, are closely connected\r\nthe most ancient of the historical ballads founded on the history of\r\nthe country. The latter, it may be presumed, soon transferred their\r\nnational tone and character into the former. But it was not until after\r\nthey had given to each other a reciprocal support, that the historical\r\nromance found a place in Spanish literature. They also mutually\r\ndeclined from the height of their common celebrity, and at last sunk\r\nagain into the obscurity attached to pieces of mere popular recreation.\r\nIn this way, however, they have retained an oral currency among the\r\ncommon people down to the present age. The Spanish critics notice\r\nthem too briefly, as if they were afraid to depreciate the dignity of\r\ntheir literature by dwelling on the antiquated and homely effusions\r\nof the poetic genius of their unlettered ancestors. But a people free\r\nfrom this prejudice who can admire simple and natural, as well as\r\nlearned and artificial poetry, and who set little or no value on the\r\nlatter, when it entirely separates itself from the former, will be\r\ndisposed to see justice more impartially distributed to the old Spanish\r\nromances.[50]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIFFERENT KINDS OF POETIC ROMANCE.\r\n\r\nThe romances composed on subjects derived from the fictions of\r\nchivalry, which have been preserved in the collections, are\r\ndistinguished by the old forms of the language, and the primitive mode\r\nof repeating a single rhyme, which often becomes a mere assonance, from\r\nthe romances of a later date, though even these have long since been\r\ncalled old. Amadis de Gaul appears to have contributed very little\r\nto this kind of ballad.[51] The great number and the longest of the\r\nromances are taken from the fabulous adventures of Charlemagne and his\r\nPaladins. In them we again meet with the twelve peers of France, who\r\nfigure in the poems of Boyardo and Ariosto, with the addition of Don\r\nGayferos, the Moor Calaynos, and other poetic characters, to whom the\r\nSpanish public were the more readily disposed to grant an historical\r\nexistence, in consequence of the chivalric history of Charlemagne’s\r\nPaladins (who are represented to have fought like the Spaniards against\r\nthe Moors,) being held in great respect as a supplemental part of\r\nSpanish National History. In progress of time, however, the romance\r\nof the Moor Calaynos became the subject of a proverb, employed to\r\ndenote verses in an old exploded and vulgar style.[52] The ballad\r\nof the _Conde Alarcos_, who with his own hands strangled his lady\r\nin satisfaction to the honour, and in obedience to the commands of\r\nhis king, appears to have had its origin in some romantic work of\r\nchivalry. This and two other romances which relate how the youthful Don\r\nGayferos avenged the death of his father, are among the best to which\r\nknight-errantry has given birth; though in the remaining specimens\r\nof this kind of ballad, the poetic genius of the age occasionally\r\ndisplays itself in all its energetic simplicity. The authors of these\r\nromances paid little regard to ingenuity of invention, and still less\r\nto correctness of execution. When an impressive story of poetical\r\ncharacter was found, the subject and the interest belonging to it were\r\nseized with so much truth and feeling, that the parts of the little\r\npiece, the brief labour of untutored art, linked themselves together,\r\nas it were, spontaneously; and the imagination of the bard had no\r\nhigher office than to give to the situations a suitable colouring\r\nand effect. This he performed without study or effort, and painted\r\nthem more or less successfully according to the inspiration, good\r\nor bad, of the moment. These antique, racy effusions of a pregnant\r\npoetic imagination, scarcely conscious of its own productive power,\r\nare nature’s genuine offspring. To recount their easily recognized\r\ndefects and faults is as superfluous, as it would be impossible by any\r\ncritical study to imitate a single trait of that noble simplicity which\r\nconstitutes their highest charm.[53]\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of the old historical romances is still more remarkable.\r\nThey form altogether a mere collection of anecdotes of Spanish\r\nhistory, from the invasion of the Moors, to the period when the\r\nauthors of the romances flourished. Neither the materials nor the\r\ninterest of the situations owe any thing to the invention of these\r\nsimple bards. They never ventured to embellish with fictitious\r\ncircumstances, stories which were already in themselves interesting,\r\nlest they should deprive their ballads of historical credit. In the\r\nhistorical romances the story displays none of those entanglements\r\nand developements which distinguish some of the longer romances of\r\nchivalry. They are simple pictures of single situations only. The\r\npoetic representation of the details which give effect to the situation\r\nis almost the only merit which can be attributed to the narrators,\r\nand they employed no critical study to obtain it. In this way were\r\nthousands of these romances destined to be composed, and partly\r\npreserved, partly forgotten, without one of their authors acquiring\r\nthe reputation of a great poet. It was regarded rather as an instance\r\nof good fortune than a proof of talent, when the author of a romance\r\nwas particularly successful in painting an interesting situation.\r\nIn general their efforts did not carry them beyond mediocrity, but\r\nmediocrity was not discouraged, for it depended entirely on accident,\r\nor perhaps some secondary causes, whether a romance became popular or\r\nsunk into oblivion. It would require a separate treatise to discuss\r\nin a satisfactory manner, the degree of merit which belongs to these\r\nnational ballads, the immense number of which defies calculation.\r\nMany little, and upon the whole very unimportant specimens are still\r\nworthy of preservation, on account of some one single trait which\r\neach exhibits. Others, on the contrary, excite attention by the happy\r\ncombination of a number of traits in themselves minute and of little\r\nvalue; again, a third class is distinguished by a sonorous rhythm\r\nnot to be found in the rest. Unfortunately, no literary critic has\r\nyet taken the trouble to arrange these pieces in anything like a\r\nchronological order. Until this be done, it cannot be discovered how\r\nthe historical romance gradually advanced from its original rudeness\r\nto the degree of relative beauty which it at last attained, though it\r\ncould not rise to classic perfection, as that kind of composition never\r\nacquired the rank or consideration of classic poetry in Spain.\r\n\r\nAmong the most ancient historical romances are several, the subjects\r\nof which have been taken from the earliest periods of Spanish\r\nhistory, anterior to the age of the Cid. Like the romances derived\r\nfrom the prose works of chivalry, they have only a single rhyme which\r\ninterchanges with blank verse, and which is frequently lost in a simple\r\nassonance.[54] The romances of the Cid, of which more than a hundred\r\nstill exist, are either of a more recent date, or have, at least,\r\nbeen in a great measure modernized.[55] In some a series of regularly\r\narranged assonances may be perceived.[56] Others are divided into\r\nstanzas, with a burden repeated at the close of each.[57] In the\r\ngreater part, however, the rhyme almost wholly disappears, and only\r\nan accidental assonance occasionally occurs. This form also prevails\r\nin most of the romances founded on the history of the Moors. Their\r\nnumber is very great, perhaps greater than that of those derived from\r\nevents of Spanish history; and this abundance might well excite as much\r\nastonishment in the critic as it has given offence to some orthodox\r\nSpaniards.[58] But even the Spaniards of old Castilian origin found\r\na certain poetic charm in the oriental manners of the Moors. On the\r\nother hand, the European chivalry, in so far as it was adopted by\r\nthe Moors, became more imposing from its union with oriental luxury,\r\nwhich favoured the display of splendid armour, waving plumes, and\r\nemblematical ornaments of every kind. The Moorish principalities or\r\nkingdoms were even more agitated by internal troubles, and acts of\r\nviolence, than the christian states; and in the former, particularly,\r\nwhen different races powerfully opposed each other, the lives of\r\ncelebrated warriors were more fertile in interesting anecdotes than in\r\nthe latter. The Christian warriors, it also appears, had sufficient\r\ngenerosity to allow justice to be done, at least to the distinguished\r\nleaders of their enemies, who are described in an old romance, as\r\n_gentlemen, though infidels_.[59] Besides, all these romances, whether\r\nof Moorish or Spanish history, whether more ancient or more modern,\r\npresent nearly the same unsophisticated character and the same artless\r\nstyle of composition. The subject is generally founded on a single\r\nfact. Thus, for example, _Roderick_, or _Don Rodrigo_, the last king\r\nof the Goths in Spain, before the Moorish invasion, takes flight after\r\nhis total overthrow, and bewails his own and his country’s fate; and\r\nthis is sufficient for a romance.[60] The Cid returns victorious\r\nfrom his exile, alights from his horse before a church, and delivers\r\na short energetic speech; this again forms the whole subject of a\r\nromance.[61] In others, with equal simplicity of story:-- the king\r\njoins the hands of the Cid and Ximena, invests him with fiefs of\r\ncastles and territories, the names of which are all recorded, and\r\nthus makes preparation for the marriage of the lovers.--The Cid lays\r\naside his armour and puts on his wedding garments, which are minutely\r\ndescribed from the hat to the boots.--At a tournament the Moorish\r\nknight Ganzul enters the lists on a fiery steed; the beautiful Zayda,\r\nwho has been unfaithful to him, once more yields up her heart to her\r\nlover, and confesses to the Moorish ladies who surround her the emotion\r\nshe experiences.[62]--The Moorish hero Abenzulema, who has filled\r\nthe prisons with Christian knights,[63] being exiled by his jealous\r\nprince, takes leave of his beloved Balaja.[64] Such is the nature of\r\na countless number of these ballads. In general, the ornaments of the\r\narmour, and the device of the knight, which must harmonize with these\r\nornaments, are minutely described. Were an artist of genius to study\r\nthese interesting situations, he would open to himself a new field for\r\nhistorical painting.\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of mythological romance in which the heroes of Greece\r\nappear in Spanish costume, which may be regarded as an imitation of\r\nthe species already described. The history of the siege of Troy,\r\nhaving been clothed in the garb of a chivalric romance, it followed,\r\nas a matter of course, that the Grecian heroes should be exhibited as\r\nknights-errant in the poetic romances. It is obvious, on examination,\r\nthat most of these mythological romances are very old.[65] Even\r\nchristianity is made to contribute to this kind of composition, and\r\nanecdotes from the bible are related in the favourite romance form;\r\nas, for example, the lamentation of king David on the death of his son\r\nAbsalom.[66]\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTILIAN POETRY IN THE THIRTEENTH AND FOURTEENTH CENTURIES.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Spanish poetry the strictly lyric romances do not form\r\na different class from the narrative romances. On the contrary,\r\nthese kinds are inseparably confounded. In like manner, no essential\r\ndistinction between what was called a _cancion_ (song), and a lyric\r\nromance, was established either in theory or in practice. A custom\r\nprevailed of classing, without distinction, under the general name of\r\nromance, any lyric expression of the feelings which ran on, in the\r\npopular manner, in a string of redondillas, without distinct strophes,\r\nand which, in that respect resembled the greater part of the narrative\r\nromances. When, however, the composition was divided into little\r\nstrophes, or coplas, it was usually called a _cancion_, a term employed\r\nin nearly the same indeterminate sense as the word _song_ in English,\r\nor _lied_ in German, but which does not correspond with the Italian\r\n_canzone_. The same name, however, came afterwards to be applied to\r\nlyric pieces of greater research and more elevated character, if they\r\nwere divided into strophes. Compositions in coplas must have been\r\ncommon in Spain about the middle of the fourteenth century; for the\r\ntraces of their origin lead back to the ancient Spanish custom of\r\naccompanying such songs, in the true style of national poetry, with\r\ndances. The saraband is one of those old national dances, during the\r\nperformance of which coplas were sung. Hence the Spanish proverb\r\ndenoting antiquated and trivial poetry, when it is said of verses that\r\n“they are not worth as much as the coplas of the saraband,” in the\r\nsame way as the romance of Calainos is quoted proverbially.[67] But\r\nmany lyric compositions which are preserved in the collections of the\r\nmost ancient of the pieces known by the general name of romances, are\r\nprobably of an older date than those in coplas which appear in the\r\n_Cancioneros_. They have, like the older romances, only a single rhyme,\r\nalternating with assonances and blank verses; but, independently of\r\nthis proof, their old language, which corresponds so naturally with\r\nthe ingenuous simplicity of their manner, is sufficient to mark their\r\nantiquity.[68]\r\n\r\nThe Castilian lyric poetry seems to have begun to confer reputation on\r\nthose who cultivated it, in the latter half of the fourteenth century.\r\nThe Marquis of Santillana, who lived in the first half of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, relates that his grandfather composed very good songs, and\r\namong others some, the first lines of which he quotes.[69] According\r\nto the statement of the Marquis, a Spanish jew, named Rabbi Santo,\r\ncelebrated as the author of maxims in verse, flourished about the same\r\ntime. He also informs us, that during the reign of John I. from 1379 to\r\n1390, Alfonso Gonzales de Castro, and some other poets, were esteemed\r\nfor their lyric compositions. But all these names, so honoured in their\r\nown age, were forgotten in the commencement of the fifteenth century,\r\nwhen under the reign of John II. there arose a new race of poets, who\r\noutshone all their predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETICAL COURT OF JOHN II.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish authors make the reign of John II. the commencement of an\r\nepoch in their poetry. But though some poetic essays of greater compass\r\nthan had previously been undertaken, were then produced, still this\r\nperiod ought really to be regarded only as that in which the ancient\r\npoetry received its last improvement, and by no means as constituting\r\na new era. The old national muse of Castile continued the favourite of\r\nmany of the grandees of the kingdom who were ambitious, in imitation of\r\nAlphonso X. of uniting the reputation of learning to the fame of their\r\npoetry, but who had more true poetic feeling than that monarch. These\r\nnoble authors thought they could acquire little honour by devoting\r\ntheir attention to the composition of romances, properly so called,\r\nbut preferred distinguishing themselves by giving to lyric poetry a\r\nhigher degree of art in its forms, and more ingenuity of invention.\r\nAs a consequence of this taste, they displayed a particular fondness\r\nfor allegory, and ingenious difficulties and subtilties of every kind\r\nwere the great objects of their labours. Their best works are some\r\ncompositions in which they seem unconsciously to have allowed nature\r\nto speak, and these specimens possess about the same value as the\r\nanonymous romances. They brought the dactylic stanzas (_versos de arte\r\nmayor_,) again into vogue, because such artificial strophes had a more\r\nlearned air than the easy flowing redondillas. Mythological illusions\r\nand moral sentences were, with these authors, the usual substitutes\r\nfor true poetic dignity. But barbarous as was their taste, nature,\r\nwhich they wished to renounce, sometimes worked so powerfully within\r\nthem, that she triumphed over the pedantic refinement to which they had\r\nsurrendered their understandings;--and the graceful facility of the\r\npopular manner occasionally appeared in their writings. In this way the\r\nancient national poetry became amalgamated with works distinguished for\r\nlaborious efforts of art, and ultimately attained a higher degree of\r\nconsideration. There resulted, however, no revolution in the literature\r\nof Spain; and it cannot be said, that the authors of the age of John\r\nII. formed an epoch, unless it be for having introduced, with more\r\nsuccess than Alphonso X. learning and philosophy into the sphere of\r\npoetry; and for having, besides, by their united endeavours, given\r\nto the ancient lyric forms of their maternal language, that sort of\r\nimprovement which, consistently with the spirit of the age, they were\r\ncapable of receiving, and which finally brought them to their highest\r\nstate of perfection.\r\n\r\nBut this period of brilliant improvement in the ancient national poetry\r\nof Spain is, in another respect, more memorable than the writers on\r\nSpanish literature appear to have regarded it. During the whole period\r\nthe Castilian monarchy was convulsed by internal troubles. Even in\r\nthe last ten years of the fourteenth century, the powerful barons of\r\nthe kingdom had almost wrested the sceptre from the hands of John I.\r\nand Henry III. Under John II. the celebrated patron of poetry, who\r\nreigned from 1407 to 1454, the monarchy was more than once menaced\r\nwith destruction. The grandees sported with the royal prerogatives,\r\nand John II. had not sufficient firmness of character to render his\r\nauthority respected. In the difficult situations in which he was\r\ninvolved, he derived, in a certain measure, his security from his love\r\nof literature, which yielded a valuable return for the favours he had\r\nbestowed. It won and preserved for him the attachment of many of the\r\nmost considerable noblemen of the country, who formed around him a\r\npoetical court, which was not without influence on public affairs. It\r\nwould not be easy to find in the history of states and of literature,\r\nanother instance of a similar court, with the members composing it,\r\nat once poets, warriors, and statesmen, surrounding and supporting a\r\nlearned sovereign, in spite of his imbecility, during a period of civil\r\ncommotion. This phenomenon proves the supremacy of the poetic spirit at\r\nthis time in Spain, since it was not to be subdued even by the spirit\r\nof political faction, which is always hostile to poetry, and which was,\r\nat this time, particularly powerful.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARQUIS OF VILLENA.\r\n\r\nPreviously to this period, before the poets had rendered the court of\r\nJohn II. the most brilliant society of the age, an eminent nobleman,\r\nthe Marquis Enrique de Villena, was distinguished for his literary\r\nefforts. He sought to adorn his erudition with the lyric graces of\r\nthe Limosin Troubadours, who had then attained their highest and\r\nfinal celebrity at the court of Arragon; and, thus united, to adapt\r\nboth the learning and the poetry to the Castilian taste. He seemed\r\ncalled by birth to the performance of this task; for he was descended\r\nby the paternal side from the kings of Arragon, and by the maternal\r\nfrom those of Castile. His reputation for metaphysical and natural\r\nknowledge was so great, that he came, at last, in that ignorant age, to\r\nbe regarded as a magician, and on that account he and his books were\r\nnever mentioned but with horror. His talent for poetic invention was,\r\nhowever, an object of particular admiration with many of the poets of\r\nthe age of John II. and among others of the Marquis de Santillana and\r\nJuan de Mena.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Villena was the author of an allegorical drama, which\r\nwas performed at the court of Arragon in celebration of a marriage,\r\nand which may, therefore, be supposed to have been written in the\r\nLimosin rather than in the Castilian language. Among the characters\r\nstated to have been introduced into this drama, are _Justice_, _Truth_,\r\n_Peace_, and _Clemency_.[70] Rhetorical and poetical competitions\r\nwere instituted at Toulouse, in the year 1324, under the name of the\r\n_Floral Games_, to foster, by prizes and gallant ceremonies, the\r\nTroubadour spirit. This institution, which was soon after imitated in\r\nArragon, was transplanted by the Marquis of Villena to Castile, but the\r\nresult of that enterprize was not successful.[71] The Marquis died\r\nat Madrid in 1434. A work supposed to have been printed at Burgos in\r\n1499, under the title of _Los trabajos de Hercules_, (The Labours of\r\nHercules), used formerly to be quoted as one of his poems; but from\r\nmore recent investigations, it appears that this pretended poem was\r\na mythological tale in prose.[72] A translation of the Æneid by the\r\nMarquis, is besides mentioned, but this work appears also to be lost.\r\nA kind of art of poetry, which he wrote under the title of _La Gaya\r\nCiencia_, has been more fortunate; for it has been partially preserved,\r\nand is still regarded with respect as the oldest work of the kind in\r\nthe Spanish language.[73] This treatise, however, does not deserve to\r\nbe called an Art of Poetry, except in a very limited sense. It must\r\nhave been intended as a necessary instruction, in the first place,\r\nfor the Marquis of Santillana, to whom it is directly addressed, and\r\ndoubtless, in the next, for the other members of the Institute of the\r\nGay Science, (_El Consistorio de la gaya Ciencia_), which the Marquis\r\nof Villena had formed in Castile. In conformity with this object, the\r\nauthor relates the history of the Institute, endeavours to prove its\r\nutility, takes that opportunity of expressing his opinion on the object\r\nof poetry in general, and concludes with laying down the principles of\r\nCastilian prosody. These principles appear to have been particularly\r\nuseful with reference to the conflict which then subsisted between\r\nthe Castilian and Limosin tongues. Among his general observations on\r\npoetry, he says--“Great are the benefits which this science confers\r\non civil society, by banishing indolence, and employing noble minds\r\nin laudable speculations: other nations have, accordingly, wished for\r\nand established among themselves, schools of this science, by which\r\nit has been diffused over different parts of the world.”[74] It is\r\nobvious that this active nobleman was full of zeal for the improvement\r\nof the poetry of his country, and for the honour of that art which was\r\ncultivated with method and dignity in the Arragonian provinces, but\r\nwhich in Castile, where it was left to itself, appeared to stand in\r\nneed of direction and encouragement. The difference between science\r\nand art was not more clearly perceived by the Marquis of Villena than\r\nby the other poets and men of learning of his age; and to distinguish\r\nthe Castilian forms of romantic poetry from the Limosin, did not appear\r\nto him necessary. Thus, while his labours contributed to heighten the\r\nrespect in which poetry and liberal pursuits were held, they had only\r\nan indirect influence on the improvement of Castilian poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARQUIS OF SANTILLANA; HIS POETICAL WORKS; HIS HISTORICAL AND\r\nCRITICAL LETTER.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the Marquis of Villena, his pupil, Don Iñigo Lopez\r\nde Mendoza, Marquis of Santa Juliana, or Santillana, appears at the\r\nhead of the brilliant society of poets who adorned the court of John\r\nII. Whenever a Marquis of Santillana is mentioned in the history of\r\nSpanish literature, without any more particular description, it is this\r\nnobleman that is meant. He was born in the year 1398. His elevated\r\nrank and great fortune, joined to the military and political talents\r\nby which he was distinguished from youth upwards, placed him in a\r\nsituation in which he was called upon to perform a principal part among\r\nthe nobles of Castile. His intellectual culture had for its basis the\r\nphilosophy of Socrates; and his strict morality procured him no less\r\ncelebrity than his sound understanding and love of science.[75] This\r\nuncommon union of rank, influence, character, talents, and learning,\r\ncould not fail to render the Marquis of Santillana highly respected;\r\nand he was indeed regarded as so extraordinary a man, that foreigners\r\nare said to have undertaken journies to Castile for the sole purpose\r\nof seeing him. He was greatly esteemed by king John, who, during the\r\ncivil wars, constantly received from him, in return, the homage which\r\nwas due to a protector of learning, though the Marquis was not always\r\nof that prince’s party. After the death of John II. in the latter\r\nyears of his life, this eminent man assisted with his counsels Henry\r\nIV. under whom the regal authority in Castile was subsequently almost\r\nannihilated. He died in the year 1458.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Santillana possessed no uncommon poetic talent. But he\r\nstudied to give to the poetry of his age a moral tendency, to extend\r\nits sphere by allegorical invention, and to adorn poetic description\r\nwith the stores of learning. Two poems, in which he has best succeeded\r\nin realizing these objects, are also the most celebrated of his works.\r\nThe first is an elegy on the death of the Marquis of Villena;[76] a\r\nlyric allegory in twenty-five dactylic stanzas, constructed according\r\nto the ancient form. The idea is very simple, and the commencement\r\nof the piece brings to recollection the hell of Dante, of which it\r\nis probably an imitation.[77] The poet loses himself in a desert,\r\nfinds himself surrounded by wild and frightful animals, advances\r\nforward, hears dismal tones of lamentation, and finally discovers some\r\nnymphs in mourning, who bewail the loss and chaunt the merits of the\r\ndeceased Marquis of Villena. On this poem, which does not discover much\r\ningenuity of invention, the Marquis of Santillana probably expended all\r\nhis stock of learning. He cites as many deities and ancient authors, as\r\nthe nature of his work will permit him to notice.[78] Such a display\r\nof erudition had never before been seen in the Castilian language. No\r\ngenial poetic spirit is to be found except in the descriptions and in\r\nsome other scattered passages of this lyric allegory;[79] but the\r\nverse is not destitute of harmony. The other considerable poem of the\r\nMarquis, consists of a series of moral reflections, occasioned by the\r\nunfortunate fate of Don Alvaro de Luna, the favourite of John II.; the\r\nMarquis called this work, _El doctrinal de Privados_, (the Manual of\r\nFavourites.) It must be regarded as the earliest didactic poem in the\r\nSpanish language, unless that title be given to any series of moral\r\nmaxims in verse. The work which is divided into fifty-three stanzas in\r\nredondillas, receives a poetic colouring from the manner in which the\r\nshade of Don Alvaro is introduced confessing his faults, and uttering\r\nthose moral truths, which the author wished to impress on the hearts of\r\nthe restless Castilians.[80] He was less successful in his love songs\r\ncomposed in the Castilian manner, to which he unfortunately thought a\r\nnew dignity would be given, by rendering them the vehicles of learned\r\nallusions. He possessed, however, the art of reconciling this pedantry\r\nwith a pleasing style of versification.[81] A kind of hymn, which he\r\ncomposed, under the title of _Los Gozos de neustra Señora_, (the Joys\r\nof our Lady) has been preserved, but it possesses no poetic merit.[82]\r\nHe also wrote a collection of proverbs and maxims in verse, for the use\r\nof the Prince Royal of Castile, who afterwards ascended a tottering\r\nthrone under the title of Henry IV.[83] However low a critical\r\nexamination might reduce the value of these works, still the Marquis of\r\nSantillana deserves to retain the place assigned to him in the history\r\nof Spanish literature by his contemporaries, by whom he was generally\r\nadmired, as the “representative of the honour of poetry.”\r\n\r\nAmong the literary remains of the Marquis of Santillana, the critical\r\nand historical letter is particularly remarkable. This letter, which\r\nis frequently mentioned in the early accounts of Spanish poetry,[84]\r\nis instructive in various respects. It affords the means of accurately\r\nobserving the infancy of Spanish criticism in that age, for the\r\nMarquis has added to the letter a collection of his ingenious maxims,\r\n(_decires_,) and of his poems for Don Pedro, a Portuguese prince;\r\nand from the embarrassment evinced by the Marquis when he attempts\r\nto give the prince an account of the rise of Castilian poetry, it is\r\nobvious, that with respect to the real origin of that poetry, less\r\nwas understood at that time than is known at the present day. Poetry,\r\nor the gay science, is, according to the Marquis of Santillana, “an\r\ninvention of useful things, which being enveloped in a beautiful\r\nveil, are arranged, exposed, and concealed according to a certain\r\ncalculation, measurement, and weight.”[85] Thus, allegory appeared to\r\nhim to belong to the essence of poetry. He could scarcely have imbibed\r\nthis opinion from Dante. In Spain, as well as in Italy and France, it\r\nseems to have issued forth from the monkish cells, when endeavours\r\nwere made to unite poetry with philosophy, and to make the poetic art\r\nthe symbol of knowledge, in order to ensure to it estimation among\r\nthe learned. The allegorical spirit which pervades the half gothic\r\npoetry of that period, is therefore inseparably connected with the\r\ncharacteristic origin of modern poetry. The Marquis of Santillana\r\nwould have come to a totally different conclusion, had he taken an\r\nunprejudiced view of the genuine national poetry of his country. But\r\nhe imagined he was laying down a principle which would ennoble it,\r\nwhen, according to his theory, he held allegory to be indispensable.\r\nWithout scruple, therefore, he confounded the Castilian and Limosin\r\npoetry together in one mass. Respecting the origin of the former, he\r\nentered into no investigation. He commences the history of poetry with\r\nMoses, Joshua, David, Solomon, and Job,[86] gives a copious account\r\nof the changes which the art of the Troubadours had undergone in\r\nthe Arragonian provinces, and adds a notice of some of the earliest\r\nGalician and Portuguese poets: among the Castilian poets, he mentions\r\nking Alphonso and some others, without saying a syllable on the subject\r\nof the ancient romances.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUAN DE MENA.\r\n\r\nJuan de Mena, who is by some writers, styled the Spanish Ennius, ranks,\r\nas a poet, in a somewhat higher scale than the Marquis of Santillana,\r\nthough he was less favoured by fortune, and was not distinguished\r\nby so many various merits as the latter. He was born in Cordova,\r\nabout the year 1412. In this southern district of Spain, which but a\r\nshort time before had been recovered from the Moors, the Castilian\r\ngenius was doubtless very rapidly naturalized. Juan de Mena, though\r\nnot descended from a family of rank,[87] was not of mean origin, and\r\nat the early age of three-and-twenty he was invested with a civil\r\nappointment in his native city. His own inclination, however, prompted\r\nhim to devote himself to philosophy, and particularly to the study of\r\nancient literature and history. From Cordova he went to the University\r\nof Salamanca. But in order more nearly to approach the source of\r\nancient literature, he undertook a journey to Rome, where he zealously\r\nprosecuted his studies. Enriched with knowledge, he returned to his\r\nnative country, and immediately attracted the notice of the Marquis\r\nof Santillana, and shortly after of king John. Both received him into\r\ntheir literary circles with distinguished approbation. The Marquis of\r\nSantillana attached himself with more friendship to Juan de Mena than\r\nto any other poet who enjoyed the favour of the king, although their\r\npolitical opinions did not always coincide. The king nominated him one\r\nof the historiographers, who, according to the arrangement which had\r\nsubsisted since the time of Alphonso X. were appointed to continue the\r\nnational chronicles. Juan de Mena lived in high favour at the court of\r\nJohn II. and was a constant adherent of the king. He died in 1456, at\r\nGuadalaxara, in New Castile, being then about forty-five years of age.\r\nThe Marquis of Santillana erected a monument to his memory.\r\n\r\nFrom the history of Juan de Mena’s life, it might be expected that his\r\nendeavours to extend the boundaries of Castilian poetry would be made\r\nunder the influence of Italian taste, more or less of which he may be\r\npresumed to have adopted, and on his return introduced into his native\r\ncountry. But no Italian poet, save Dante, appears to have produced\r\nany remarkable impression on him. Indeed, with the exception of Dante\r\nand Petrarch, there was, at that period, no Italian poet of classic\r\nconsideration; and in the first half of the fifteenth century Italian\r\npoetry suddenly declined. Sonnets were still in favour throughout the\r\nwhole of Italy, but Juan de Mena continued faithful to the old forms\r\nof the Castilian poetry, perhaps from a feeling of national pride. He\r\ncertainly did not imitate the sonnet; and even from Dante himself, he\r\ncopied neither metrical form nor style. In allegory alone he followed\r\nthe footsteps of the Italian poet. His most celebrated poem is, the\r\nLabyrinth, (_el Labyrintho_) or, the Three Hundred Stanzas (_las\r\ntrecientas_,) an allegorical historical didactic work, in old dactylic\r\nverse (_versos de arte mayor_.[88]) Had the Labyrinth proved what,\r\naccording to the idea of the author, it was intended to be, it would\r\nhave been proper, merely on account of that single work, to commence\r\na new epoch of Spanish poetry with the reign of John II. But with all\r\nits merits, which have been highly extolled by some authors, and which\r\nare certainly by no means trivial, it can only be regarded as a mere\r\nspecimen of gothic art.[89] It belongs to the period which gave it\r\nbirth, and bears no traces of the superiority of a genius which might\r\nhave ruled the spirit of the age. Juan de Mena formed the grand design\r\nof executing in this work an allegorical picture of the whole course\r\nof human life. His intention was, to embrace every age, to immortalize\r\ngreat virtues, to stigmatize with opprobrium great vices, and to\r\nrepresent in striking colours the irresistible power of destiny.[90]\r\nBut the poetical invention of Juan de Mena was subordinate to his\r\nfalse learning. The three hundred stanzas, of which the poem consists,\r\nare divided into seven orders, (_ordenes_), in imitation of the seven\r\nplanets, the influence of which, according to Juan de Mena’s doctrine,\r\nis wisely prescribed by Providence. To represent this influence\r\nfiguratively, Mena resorted to a most insipid and grotesque invention.\r\nAfter invoking Apollo and Calliope, and earnestly apostrophising\r\nFortune,[91] he loses himself in imitation of Dante in an allegorical\r\nworld, where a female of astonishing beauty appears to him, and becomes\r\nhis guide. This female is Providence:[92] she conducts him to three\r\nwheels, two of which are motionless, while the third is in a state\r\nof continual movement. These wheels, it will readily be conjectured,\r\nrepresent the past, the present, and the future. Human beings drop\r\ndown through this mill of time. The centre wheel turns them round.\r\nEach has his name and destiny inscribed on his forehead. While the\r\nwheel of the present is revolving with all the existing human race,\r\nit is controlled astrologically in its motion by the seven orders or\r\ncircles of the seven planets under the influence of which men are born.\r\nWhether or not these circles are perceptible on the wheel itself, is\r\nnot clearly stated. To this description succeeds, in the order of the\r\nseven planets, a long gallery of mythological and historical pictures,\r\nwhich presents abundant fruits of the poet’s extensive reading. This\r\ngrotesque composition is interspersed with individual passages of great\r\ninterest and beauty, though none of the traits call to mind similar\r\ntraits in Dante. The most glowing passages of the lyric, didactic, and\r\nnarrative class, are those in which Juan de Mena gives utterance to\r\nthe language of Spanish patriotism.[93] He is particularly successful\r\nin the description of the death of the Count de Niebla, a Spanish\r\nnaval hero, who attempted to recover Gibraltar from the Moors; but\r\nthrough ignorance of the return of the tide, fell a sacrifice to the\r\nwaves, because he preferred perishing with his men, to saving himself\r\nsingly.[94] But particular attention is bestowed on Don Alvaro de\r\nLuna,[95] the favourite of the king, who is introduced in this poem\r\nwith great pomp, under the constellation of Saturn. When Juan de Mena\r\nwrote this poem, and thus proclaimed the glory of de Luna, the latter\r\nhad not yet fallen, and the energy of his character seemed to promise,\r\nas the poet prophesied, that he would ultimately triumph over all the\r\nCastilian nobles who had excited the hostility of the country against\r\nhim. King John, as may naturally be supposed, is in Juan de Mena’s\r\nLabyrinth complimented on every suitable occasion. A genealogy of the\r\nkings of Spain forms the conclusion of the poem; and thus were the\r\nSpaniards made to feel a kind of national interest for the whole work,\r\nwhich in some measure subsists, at least among their writers at the\r\npresent day. Even in Juan de Mena’s time, the learned solecisms with\r\nwhich he endeavoured to elevate his poetic language were uncommon;[96]\r\nbut other essential faults, such, for instance, as Aristotelian\r\ndefinitions in verse, were then esteemed great beauties; and the gothic\r\nand fantastic hyperboles in praise of king John, with which the poem\r\nopens, as if intended to appal the reader at the outset, were not at\r\nthat period considered unpoetic.[97]\r\n\r\nBut king John was not satisfied with the torrent of praise which was\r\npoured upon him by Mena’s Labyrinth. The king, with critical gravity,\r\nsignified his wish that the poet should add sixty-five stanzas to the\r\nthree hundred which he had already written, so that by making the\r\nnumber of stanzas correspond with the number of days in the year,\r\nthe beauty of the composition might be heightened. The sixty-five\r\nnew stanzas were also to have a political tendency, with the view of\r\nrecalling the rebellious nobles to their allegiance. Juan de Mena\r\nproceeded to the prescribed task; but he could produce no more than\r\ntwenty-four additional stanzas (_coplas añadidas_.) They are contained\r\nin the _Cancionero general_.\r\n\r\nAnother work of Juan de Mena, very celebrated at the period when\r\nthe poet flourished, is his Ode for the Poetical Coronation of the\r\nMarquis of Santillana.[98] That Mecænas sometimes vied with him in the\r\ncomposition of ingenious questions, or enigmas and their answers,\r\nwhich were versified by both in dactylic stanzas.[99] His other poems\r\nare, for the most part, love songs, in the style of the age, and\r\naccording to the perverted taste of the poet, loaded with mythological\r\nlearning. In the course of this work further notice will be taken of\r\nthese songs, together with other amatory poems of the same period.\r\nDuring the last year of his life, Juan de Mena was engaged in a moral\r\nallegorical poem, which, however, he did not complete. It was entitled\r\na Treatise on Vices and Virtues, (_Tractado de Vicios y Virtudes_.)\r\nThe author intended in an epic poem to represent the “more than civil\r\nwar,” which the will, instigated by the passions, maintains with\r\nreason.[100] The will and reason are in the end personified.\r\n\r\nTo collect biographical notices of the other poets and writers of verse\r\nwho enjoyed the favour of king John II. and whose works are partly\r\ncontained in the _Cancionero general_, or to give an extensive account\r\nof their productions, is a task which must be resigned to the author\r\nwho has made this department of Spanish literature his particular\r\nstudy. As to poetic value, the writings of all those authors are in the\r\nmain the same; and it may therefore be presumed that it will prove more\r\ninstructive to consider works so nearly related to each other, under\r\nthe comprehensive view of general criticism. A few notices, however,\r\nof men worthy of more particular remembrance, may precede the critical\r\ncomparison of their works.[101]\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEREZ DE GUZMAN, RODRIGUEZ DEL PADRON, AND OTHER SPANISH LYRIC\r\n    POETS OF THE AGE OF JOHN II.\r\n\r\nFernan Perez de Guzman was held in no trifling consideration at the\r\ncourt of John II. His family, which was one of the most distinguished\r\nin Castile, was related to all the other great families in the\r\ncountry. As a poet, he studied to combine the peculiar tone of moral\r\nand spiritual poetry with that of the old romances. His Representation\r\nof the Four Cardinal Virtues, dedicated to the Marquis of Santillana,\r\nwhich consists of sixty-four strophes or couplets, is versified in\r\nredondillas, as are also his _Ave Maria_, his _Paternoster_, and his\r\nother spiritual songs.\r\n\r\nRodriguez del Padron seems likewise to have been held in some esteem\r\nat the court of John II. His family name is not known, and as little\r\nare the dates of his birth and death, but he is named after the\r\nplace of his nativity, the little town El Padron in Galicia. It is\r\nremarkable that in his poetry he dropped his Galician idiom and\r\nadopted the Castilian. Besides the reputation he obtained by his\r\npoetic productions, which are chiefly love songs, he is celebrated\r\nfor his friendship with the Galician poet Macias, who will be further\r\nmentioned in the history of Portuguese poetry. The tragical death of\r\nMacias, who fell a sacrifice to his romantic susceptibility, made such\r\nan impression on Rodriguez del Padron, that he shut himself up in a\r\nDominican cloister, which he had erected at his own expense. He became\r\na monk, and terminated his life in that convent.\r\n\r\nAlonzo de Santa Maria, called also Alonzo de Cartagena, wrote love\r\nsongs, probably in his youth, and then devoted himself to spiritual\r\naffairs. He died Archbishop of Burgos, in the year 1456.\r\n\r\nSeveral other poets whose works fill the _Cancionero general_, also\r\nlived in the reign, or rather under the anticipated domination of\r\nqueen Isabella, who, in the year 1465, vouchsafed to her almost\r\ndethroned brother, Henry IV. the little authority, which, as a nominal\r\nking he retained till his death in 1474. At this troubled period Garci\r\nSanchez de Badajoz sang his passionate and glowing songs of love; and\r\nat the same time flourished the two Manriques, Gomez Manrique and\r\nJorge Manrique; the latter was nephew to the former. Both owed the\r\nconsideration they enjoyed no less to their poetical works than to\r\ntheir high and pure Castilian descent. The Bachelor de la Torre, of\r\nwhom nothing further is known than what his own songs express, lived at\r\nthe same period.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CANCIONERO GENERAL, AND THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANCIENT SPANISH\r\nSONGS.\r\n\r\nBetween the works of the above poets, all of which are to be found in\r\nthe _Cancionero general_, and the other poems contained in the same\r\ncollection, whether their authors lived in the first or the second half\r\nof the fifteenth century, there is a very striking resemblance. This\r\ncollection, so remarkable in its kind, may therefore be regarded as a\r\nsingle work, which, together with a portion of the General Romance Book\r\n(_Romancero general_), embraces nearly all the Castilian poetry of the\r\nfifteenth century. No other remains of Spanish poetry, belonging to\r\nthe same age, are sufficiently important to be brought into comparison\r\nwith this national treasure. It may not, then, be improper to introduce\r\nhere, a few particulars respecting the history of the _Cancionero\r\ngeneral_. Of the _Romancero general_ some further account must\r\nhereafter be given.\r\n\r\nThe bibliographic notices towards the history of the collections of\r\nSpanish poetry, to be found in the works of various authors, readily\r\nexplain why many old Spanish poems and names of poets have been\r\neither totally lost, or are still only preserved in manuscript in a\r\nway which renders them foreign to literature. It appears that having\r\nbeen withheld from the press, on the introduction of printing into\r\nSpain,[102] they were forgotten as soon as other collections were made\r\nknown by means of that art. In the reign of John II. Alphonso de Baena,\r\nwho himself wrote in verse, prepared a collection of old lyric pieces,\r\nunder the title of _Cancionero de Poetas Antiguos_. This collection,\r\nthough still preserved in the library of the Escurial, was never\r\nprinted;[103] but a list of the poets whose works are contained in it,\r\nhas appeared, and includes names which do not occur elsewhere. Alvarez\r\nde Villapandino is mentioned as a particularly excellent “master and\r\npatron of the said art,” namely, poetry. Sanchez Salavera, Ruy Paez\r\nde Ribera, and others, of whom besides their names, nothing else is\r\nknown, are also cited. It is not very probable that Alphonso de Baena’s\r\ncollection was the origin of that which subsequently appeared under\r\nthe title of the _Cancionero general_. Of this celebrated collection\r\nit is merely known that it was originally produced by Fernando del\r\nCastillo, at the commencement of the sixteenth century, and within a\r\nshort period frequently augmented and reprinted. Fernando del Castillo\r\nbegan his collection with the poets of the age of John II. He did not,\r\nhowever, take the trouble to carry on the series in chronological order\r\nthrough the fifteenth century. He places the spiritual poems before\r\nthe rest. He then gives the works of several poets of the reign of\r\nJohn II. mingled with others of more recent date, but so arranged,\r\nthat the productions of each author seem to be kept distinct. After,\r\nhowever, the works are thus apparently given, other poems follow under\r\nparticular heads, partly by the same and partly by different authors,\r\nwhose names are sometimes mentioned and sometimes not: there are also\r\na few Italian sonnets, and some coplas in the Valencian language.\r\nIn proportion as the collection extended, the additions were always\r\ninserted at the end of the book. In the oldest editions the number of\r\npoets mentioned amounts to one hundred and thirty-six.[104]\r\n\r\nA nation which can enumerate one hundred and thirty-six song writers\r\nin a single century, and which also possesses a great number of songs\r\nby unknown authors, produced within the same period, may well boast of\r\nits lyric genius; and the literary historian, before he proceeds to\r\na closer review of this collection, may reasonably expect to find in\r\nit a full and true representation of the national character. Thus the\r\nold Spanish _Cancionero_ is even more interesting to the philosophic\r\nobserver of human nature than to the critic.\r\n\r\nThe Spiritual Songs, (_Obras de Devocion_,) at the head of the\r\ncollection, probably will not fulfil the expectations which may be\r\nformed respecting them. It is natural to presume that in a nation so\r\npoetically inclined, and in an age when, for the most part, nature was\r\nfollowed without reference to the rules of art, the poets could not\r\nfail to view Christianity on its poetic side. But the scholastic forms\r\nof the existing theology crushed the genius of poetry; and the unpoetic\r\nside of Christianity, because it was the most learned, was alone deemed\r\nworthy the strains of the Spanish poets of the fifteenth century. They\r\nlikewise seldom ventured to give scope to the fancy in devotional\r\nverses, because the nation was accustomed to the most implicit faith\r\nin every dogma of the church, and the recognition of the sacredness\r\nof literal interpretation was identified with orthodoxy, long before\r\nthe terrors of the inquisition and its burning piles were known. This\r\nrigid orthodoxy of the Spanish Christians was a consequence of their\r\nwar of five hundred years duration with the Moors. Throughout that\r\nlong period the Spanish knight invariably fought for religion and\r\nhis country; and from the constant hostility that prevailed between\r\nthe Christian and Mahometan faiths, the Spanish Christians were wont\r\nto make a parade of their creed, as the Christians of the east are\r\naccustomed to do at the present day. Hence the strictest formality\r\nwas observed in all matters connected with religion; and great as was\r\nthe enthusiasm of the Spaniards in the fifteenth century, it produced\r\nfew, if any, lyric compositions, containing more poetry than a common\r\nhymn. Whether reference be made to the Twenty Perfections of the\r\nHoly Virgin,[105] (_Obra en loor de veinte excellencias de nuestra\r\nSeñora_), by Juan Tulante, who is the author of most of the spiritual\r\nsongs in the _Cancionero general_; to the play on the five letters\r\nof the name _Maria_,[106] by the Visconde de Altamira; or to Fernan\r\nPerez de Guzman’s versions of the _Ave Maria_ and _Paternoster_,[107]\r\nwhich could not have been more dryly and formally written in prose;\r\nwe find in all the same monotony without any poetic adaptation of the\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nThe moral poems of this collection do not weigh heavier in the scale\r\nof poetic merit. The art which the ancients possessed of introducing\r\nmoral ideas into the region of poetry, was not attainable by the\r\npupils of the monastic schools. They allegorized either virtues or\r\nvices according to the catalogue and definitions of the scholastic\r\nphilosophy; or they made common place observations on human life,\r\nsometimes with declamatory pomp, sometimes with real warmth of feeling,\r\nand occasionally in agreeable verse, though destitute of any poetic\r\nspirit. Gomez Manrique with commendable frankness addressed a didactic\r\npoem on the Duties of Sovereigns (_Regimiento de Principes_) in\r\nredondillas, to Queen Isabella and her husband Ferdinand of Arragon;\r\nbut however valuable the truths which he wished to impart to the\r\nroyal pair, he could only express them in versified prose.[108] The\r\nmoral coplas of his nephew Jorge Manrique present somewhat stronger\r\nclaims to poetic merit; they were subsequently glossed as a National\r\nBook of Devotion, and were held in high estimation up to a recent\r\nperiod.[109] In the moral as well as in the spiritual songs the\r\ncharacter of the nation is manifest. With equal warmth of feeling, with\r\nthe same disposition for light and sportive gaiety, the Spaniards were\r\ninvariably distinguished from the Italians by moral gravity. Hence,\r\nthey have in all times set a high value on rules of conduct, sentences,\r\nand useful proverbs, and have never regarded the principles of genuine\r\nrectitude as less important than maxims of worldly wisdom.\r\n\r\nBut love songs form by far the principal part of the contents of the\r\nold Spanish _Cancioneros_. To read them regularly through, would\r\nrequire a strong passion for compositions of this class, for the\r\nmonotony of the authors is interminable. To extend and spin out a theme\r\nas long as possible, though only to seize a new modification of the\r\nold ideas or phrases, was, in their opinion, essential to the truth\r\nand sincerity of their poetic effusions of the heart. That loquacity\r\nwhich is an hereditary fault of the Italian Canzone, must also be\r\nendured in perusing the amatory flights of the Spanish redondillas,\r\nwhile in them the Italian correctness of expression would be looked\r\nfor in vain. From the desire perhaps of relieving their monotony, by\r\nsome sort of variety the authors have indulged in even more witticisms\r\nand plays of words than the Italians, but they also sought to infuse\r\na more emphatic spirit into their compositions than the latter.[110]\r\nThe Spanish poems of this class, exhibit, in general, all the poverty\r\nof the compositions of the Troubadours, but blend with the simplicity\r\nof these bards, the pomp of the Spanish national style in its utmost\r\nvigour. This resemblance to the Troubadour songs was not however\r\nproduced by imitation; it arose out of the spirit of romantic love,\r\nwhich at that period, and for several preceding centuries, gave to\r\nthe south of Europe the same feelings and taste. Since the age of\r\nPetrarch, this spirit had appeared in classical perfection in Italy.\r\nBut the Spanish amatory poets of the fifteenth century had not reached\r\nan equal degree of cultivation; and the whole turn of their ideas\r\nrequired rather a passionate than a tender expression. The sighs of the\r\nlanguishing Italians became cries in Spain. Glowing passion, despair\r\nand violent ecstacy, were the soul of the Spanish love songs. The\r\ncontinually recurring picture of the contest between reason and passion\r\nis a peculiar characteristic of these songs. The Italian poets did not\r\nplace so much importance on the triumph of reason. The rigidly moral\r\nSpaniard was, however, anxious to be wise even in the midst of his\r\nfolly. But this obtrusion of wisdom in its improper place, frequently\r\ngives an unpoetic harshness to the lyric poetry of Spain, in spite of\r\nall the softness of its melody. It would be no unprofitable or useless\r\ntask to pursue this comparison still further. But the limited extent of\r\nthis work can afford space for only a few notices and examples.\r\n\r\nHow successful the Spanish poets of the fifteenth century were in\r\ngay and graceful love songs, when guided only by their own feelings,\r\nis manifest from some of the compositions of Juan de Mena; but the\r\ncharm vanishes the instant the poet begins to display his skill\r\nand erudition.[111] In a love song by Diego Lopez de Haro, reason\r\nand the mind enter into a prolix conversation on the value to be\r\nattached to affections of the heart; and the thinking faculty admits\r\nreason at the expense of poetry.[112] In the other songs of the\r\nsame author, in which the mind obeys only the heart, he is poetic in\r\nall the simplicity of passion, though in search of wit he sometimes\r\ninvolves himself in obscure subtilties.[113] The fire of passion is\r\nexcellently painted, even amidst sports of wit,[114] in several\r\nsongs by Alonzo de Cartagena, afterwards archbishop of Burgos; and it\r\nseems to rage incessantly in the love songs of Guivara, to one of\r\nwhich he has given the emphatic title of _El Infierno de Amores_; or,\r\nThe Hell of Love.[115] Sanchez de Badajoz, when, like a despairing\r\nlover, he wrote his will in poetry, thought he might avail himself\r\nof some passages from the book of Job to express his suffering. He\r\ndivided this strange kind of will into nine lessons, (_leciones_).\r\nThe ideas are very extravagant, but the execution is vigorous, and\r\nin many parts not unpoetic.[116] It might be presumed that profane\r\napplications of the doctrines and language of the bible would have\r\ngiven offence to the Spanish public, or at least alarmed the guardians\r\nof catholic orthodoxy. But such was not the case. Rodriguez del Padron\r\nchose the Seven Joys of Love as the subject of one of his songs, the\r\ntitle of which calls to mind the Marquis of Santillana’s Joys of the\r\nHoly Virgin; he also versified Love’s Ten Commandments, (_Los diez\r\nMadamientos de Amor_.)\r\n\r\nThe other kinds of lyric poems, for example, the laudatory poems, which\r\nare dispersed through the _Cancionero general_, are not distinguished\r\nby any peculiar features; but the poems under miscellaneous titles in\r\nthis collection deserve particular attention. They exhibit the natural\r\nstyle, amalgamated with a conventional, and thus form the model of a\r\nspecies of national poetry, which has descended to the present age.\r\nCertain short lyric poems, usually called songs, (_canciones_,) in\r\nthe more strict sense of the term are distinguished by a peculiar\r\ncharacter and a decided metrical form. They have always a sententious\r\nor an epigramatic turn. The number of lines is generally twelve, which\r\nare divided into two parts. The first four lines comprehend the idea\r\non which the song is founded. And this idea is developed or applied\r\nin the eight following lines. The _Cancionero general_ contains one\r\nhundred and fifty-six of these little songs, some of which are the best\r\npoems in the whole book. For this advantage they are probably indebted\r\nto their conventional form, which confined the romantic verbosity\r\nwithin narrow bounds. These little songs were to the Spaniards of the\r\nfifteenth century, what the epigram had been to the Greeks, and what\r\nthe madrigal was to the Italians and French. Like the latter, they\r\nare generally devoted to some theme of gallantry; and though they do\r\nnot possess so high a polish, yet the interest excited by the truth\r\nwith which they paint the character of the age, and their ingenious\r\nsimplicity, entitles them to be ranked among the sweetest blossoms of\r\nthe ancient spirit of romance.[117]\r\n\r\nThe Villancicos bear an immediate affinity to these little songs. The\r\nidea which forms the subject of the Villancico, is sometimes contained\r\nin two, but more commonly in three lines. The developement, or\r\napplication, may be completed in one short stanza, but often extends to\r\nseveral similar stanzas. These stanzas always include seven lines. It\r\nwas, perhaps, by way of irony that the name Villancico was originally\r\napplied to productions of this kind; for the spiritual motets,\r\nwhich are sung during high mass on Christmas eve, are also called\r\nVillancicos. At least no satisfactory etymology has yet been found for\r\nthe name. The _Cancionero general_ contains fifty-four Villancicos, and\r\namong them are some which possess inimitable grace and delicacy.[118]\r\n\r\nThese remarkable compositions, whose origin appears to be lost in the\r\nearly periods of the formation of the Spanish language, doubtless gave\r\nrise to the poetic gloss (_glosa_,) a kind of poem scarcely known, even\r\nby name, on this side of the Pyrenees, but to which the Spaniards and\r\nPortuguese of the fifteenth century were particularly attached, and\r\nwhich subsequently even after the introduction of the Italian forms,\r\ncontinued to be preserved as national poetry in Spain and Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe poetic glosses may, in some measure, be compared to musical\r\nvariations. The musician selects as his theme some well known melody,\r\nwhich he paraphrases or modifies into variations; in like manner in\r\nSpain and Portugal, well known songs and romances were paraphrased or\r\nmodified into new productions, but in such a manner that the original\r\ncomposition was, without any alteration in the words, intertwined line\r\nafter line, at certain intervals into the new one. A poem of this kind\r\nwas called a gloss. By this operation the connection of the glossed\r\npoem was broken, and the comparison of the poetic glosses to musical\r\nvariations is therefore not in all respects exactly just. But the\r\ndistinction between them arises out of the different nature of the\r\narts of music and poetry; and it is indeed more surprising that these\r\ncompositions have not flourished beyond the boundaries of Spain and\r\nPortugal, than that they should have been peculiar favourites in those\r\ntwo countries. At first, the old romances were glossed;[119] then, as\r\nit appears, mottos, or sentiments, (_motes_,) in the style of gallantry\r\npeculiar to the age,[120] and, at length, every thing that was capable\r\nof being glossed. There is a particular class of _jeux d’esprit_, in\r\nthe _Cancionero general_, namely, versified questions and answers,\r\nand versified interpretations of devices (_letras_,) which, together\r\nwith corresponding emblems, lords and ladies drew by lot at festivals,\r\ntourneys, bull fights, &c. But these questions, answers, and devices,\r\nare in general more whimsical than ingenious.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE ROMANCERO GENERAL.\r\n\r\nThe latter half of the fifteenth century seems also to have given birth\r\nto the greater portion of those Spanish romances, which wrested the\r\napprobation of criticism and public favour from the older productions\r\nof the same class; and which, therefore, in the sequel, formed the bulk\r\nof the _Romancero general_, or General Romance Book. This Romancero\r\nof the Spaniards is so closely related to their _Cancionero general_,\r\nthat some account of it may not be out of place here, though it was\r\nnot printed as a complete collection until the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. With the exception of the narrative romances, the Romancero\r\nmay be considered merely as a continuation of the Cancionero. The\r\npoetry of the lyric pieces contained in it, which are extremely\r\nnumerous, is both in spirit and metrical form, precisely the same as\r\nthat which appears in the Cancionero, but more polished in manner and\r\nlanguage. The title of romance indicates no essential difference. The\r\nnarrative romances, which occupy the greater portion of the Romancero,\r\nhave, in some measure, been characterized in this history in treating\r\nof the old romances of the same class; for most of them, particularly\r\nthose of the historical kind, differ little from the more ancient.\r\nBut a considerable portion of compositions of every class have been\r\ncontributed to the Romancero by poets of the sixteenth century. The\r\ncollectors have mingled these romances and the older ones together,\r\nwithout any attention to critical arrangement or chronological order;\r\nand in no instance is there any mention or indication of an author.\r\nIn a history of literature, it therefore becomes necessary to speak\r\nof the Romancero as a whole; and for this purpose, the present is\r\nperhaps the most convenient opportunity; for, even at the period when\r\nthis collection was produced, the poets who wrote romances in the old\r\nnational style, merely improved that style without essentially altering\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAmong the historical romances, contained in the Romancero, those\r\nin which anecdotes of the Moorish war, or the heroic and gallant\r\nadventures of Moorish knights, are poetically treated, seem, for the\r\nmost part, to belong to the latter half of the fifteenth century. All\r\nthese romances relate to the civil wars of Granada, the last Moorish\r\nprincipality in Spain. The civil dissensions of Castile retarded for\r\nupwards of half a century the conquest of Granada, which was at length\r\neffected in the year 1492, by the united power of Isabella of Castile\r\nand Ferdinand of Arragon. During this last period of the conflict\r\nbetween the Christians and the Mahometans of Spain, the former became\r\nmore intimately acquainted with the history of the latter. As the last\r\nblow for the deliverance of the Peninsula was now about to be struck,\r\nall that related to the Moors was doubly interesting to the Castilians.\r\nThe two rival factions, the Zegris and the Abencerrages, whose mutual\r\nenmity accelerated the fall of Granada, were, in a particular manner,\r\nthe objects of their adversaries attention.\r\n\r\nAbout this period it seems to have become a fashion among the Spanish\r\nromance writers, to select from the events of Moorish history,\r\nmaterials for their songs; and in these romances the heroes of the\r\nZegri and Abencerrage tribes sustain the principal characters. Even\r\nafter the conquest of Granada, the interest excited throughout Spain\r\nby that great national event, still continued; and, doubtless, many\r\nromances, the subjects of which are borrowed from Moorish history, were\r\nproduced in the sixteenth century.[121]\r\n\r\nThe first Spanish pastoral romances, were probably produced during the\r\nlast ten years of the fifteenth century. But no distinct traces exist\r\nof the rise of this species of poetry in Spain. In the poetry of the\r\nage of John II. neither pastoral names nor ideas appear, except in the\r\nsatyrical poem, entitled, _Mingo Rebulgo_, which will be hereafter\r\nnoticed. Pastoral dramas are, however, to be found in the works of\r\nJuan de la Enzina, who flourished towards the close of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and of whom we shall also have occasion to speak more at\r\nlarge. The Spanish pastoral poetry seems, shortly after its rise, to\r\nhave been blended with the romantic poetry. Many of the most beautiful\r\nnarrative pieces in the _Romancero general_ are properly pastoral\r\nromances. It is quite impossible to ascertain correctly to what age\r\nthese bucolicks belong;[122] and it has, hitherto, proved equally\r\nimpossible to obtain any positive information respecting the origin of\r\nthe facetious and satyrical romances and songs, dispersed through the\r\n_Romancero general_.[123]\r\n\r\nFinally, the history of the _Romancero general_ itself still waits for\r\nbibliographic illustration; and in order to throw any light on this\r\nsubject, it would be necessary to have the opportunity of examining\r\nthe Spanish libraries and old collections of manuscripts, and to be\r\nable to bestow on them the most indefatigable attention. Of all the\r\ncollections, bearing the common title of _Romancero general_, only\r\ntwo are quoted by authors; one was edited by Miguel de Madrigal, in\r\nthe year 1604; and the other by Pedro de Flores in 1614.[124] Another\r\npublication, however, under the same title, which also appeared in\r\n1604, and which contains upwards of a thousand romances and songs,\r\nprofesses to be a new and augmented collection of this kind.[125] At\r\nwhat time, then, was the first collection made or published?\r\n\r\nThose, however, who may think it unimportant to enquire how many of\r\nthese anonymous poems, which have for ages delighted the Spanish\r\npublic, were produced in the fifteenth or sixteenth century, and who\r\nmay merely wish to see a selection of the best Spanish poems in the\r\nold national style, have only to turn to the _Romancero general_.\r\nMany of the narrative romances which it contains, vie, in romantic\r\nsimplicity, with those of apparently older date in other collections,\r\nand exceed them in elegance; and still more do a number of the songs\r\nin the _Romancero_ surpass those in the _Cancionero general_. Thus the\r\nhistorian of literature has additional cause to lament that through\r\nthe absence of all chronological and bibliographical notices, he is\r\ndeprived of even the slight satisfaction of paying a just tribute to\r\nthe memory of the authors of the best of these romances and songs,\r\nwhich really deserve to be immortal. The poets themselves, it is\r\ntrue, do not seem to have attached much value to fame. If their\r\nsongs, accompanied by the guitar, interested the hearts and charmed\r\nthe ears of their auditors, they sought no laurels in addition to\r\nthat true reward of the poet. Yet, for this very reason, in an age\r\nwhen the lowest degree of poetic merit presumptuously claims literary\r\ndistinction, the task would be the more pleasing to do honour to those\r\nvenerable authors, by raising the veil beneath which their names have\r\ntoo long been concealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FIRST TRACES OF THE ORIGIN OF SPANISH DRAMATIC POETRY IN THE\r\n    MINGO REBULGO--JUAN DEL ENZINA--CALLISTUS AND MELIBŒA, A DRAMATIC\r\n    TALE.\r\n\r\nAll that now remains to be stated respecting the poetic literature of\r\nthe Spaniards during the fifteenth century, must be comprehended in a\r\nnotice of their first essays in dramatic poetry.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of those poetic works which are styled dramatic in the true\r\nsense of the word, and which afterwards formed the most brilliant\r\nportion of Spanish poetry, the Spaniards of the fifteenth century\r\npossessed merely spiritual or temporal farces, written in the style\r\nwhich prevailed in the middle ages, and which can scarcely be said\r\nto belong to literature. At Saragossa, the residence of the Court of\r\nArragon, attempts towards the improvement of dramatic amusements were\r\nearlier made than in the Castilian court. There, as has already been\r\nobserved, the Marquis de Villena devoted his learning and inventive\r\ntalents to the drama. Allegorical dramas, indeed, do not seem to have\r\nbeen in favour at the court of Castile, notwithstanding the taste for\r\nallegory which distinguished the poets of the reign of John II. A\r\nsingular union of pastoral and satirical poetry first gave birth to a\r\nspecies of dramatic poem in the Castilian language.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of John II. an anonymous poet amused himself by describing\r\nthe court of that monarch in satirical coplas. It is impossible to\r\naccount for the whim which induced him to throw his rhymes into the\r\nform of a dialogue, and to select shepherds for his interlocutors.\r\nThe work extends to thirty-two coplas, and critics have sometimes\r\nclassed it among the eclogues, and sometimes among the first satirical\r\nproductions of the Spanish poets. Some make Rodrigo de Cota the author\r\nof these coplas; and others, who ascribe them to Juan de Mena, seem to\r\nforget that the latter was zealously devoted to the court party. This\r\nsingular composition is usually mentioned under the title of Mingo\r\nRebulgo, from the names of the two shepherds who carry on the dialogue.\r\nSupposing pastoral poetry to have been in vogue at that period in\r\nSpain, and particularly at the court of John II. it would be easy to\r\nexplain how a witty author might conceive the bold idea of converting a\r\npastoral dialogue into a satire; but in that case the ideas of a poetic\r\npastoral existence must have been diffused through Spain, as they were\r\nthrough Italy. It is probable, however, that in both countries the\r\nrevived study of classical literature, and particularly of Virgil’s\r\neclogues, gave rise to the practice of clothing modern ideas in a garb\r\nimitated from the ancient bucolic poetry; and it seems the effect of\r\nmere accident that a Spaniard should have been the first to devote a\r\nwork of this kind to the purposes of satire.[126]\r\n\r\nDoubtless neither the eclogue of Mingo Rebulgo, nor the colloquial\r\nstanzas in the _Cancionero_ can properly be regarded as the\r\ncommencement of dramatic poetry in Spain. But all these preliminary\r\nessays in dialogue, are in a literary point of view connected together;\r\nand about the close of the fifteenth century, pastoral dialogues were\r\nconverted into real dramas, by a musical composer, named Juan de la\r\nEnzina, or del Enzina, as he is styled in the old collections of his\r\nworks. This ingenious man who was born in Salamanca during the reign of\r\nQueen Isabella, though in what year is not precisely known, was equally\r\ncelebrated as a poet and musician. He travelled to Jerusalem in company\r\nwith the Marquis de Tarifa, and this journey could not fail to store\r\nhis mind with many new ideas. He lived for some time at Rome in the\r\nquality of chapel-master, or musical director to Pope Leo; who, it is\r\nwell known, afforded great encouragement to dramatic amusements. But\r\nat Rome, as well as in Palestine, Juan de la Enzina still remained a\r\nSpaniard. His poetry imbibed no tincture of the Italian taste, and he\r\ncontinued to write songs and lyric romances in the old Castilian style.\r\nHe also exercised his fancy in making jests, consisting of ridiculous\r\ncombinations or heterogeneous conceits, called _disparates_, which he\r\nwrote in the form of romances. For instance, he talks with an absurd\r\nbut harmless humour of a “cloud which at night, at day break in the\r\nafternoon arrived from a pilgrimage, having in its train a domestic\r\nutensil which appeared in _pontificalibus_,” &c.[127] These oddities\r\nrendered his name a proverb in Spain. He converted Virgil’s eclogues\r\ninto romances, in which he displayed singular simplicity, and applied\r\nto his patrons, Ferdinand and Isabella, the duke and duchess of Alba,\r\nand others, the compliments which Virgil addressed to the emperor\r\nAugustus. Accident had introduced into Spain a mixture of pastoral\r\npoetry with the drama, and Juan de la Enzina wrote sacred and profane\r\neclogues, in the form of dialogues, which were represented before\r\ndistinguished audiences on Christmas eve, during the carnival, and on\r\nother festivals. They are, however, entirely lost to literature.[128]\r\n\r\nThe dramatic romance of _Callistus_ and _Melibœa_ is, however, more\r\ncelebrated than Juan de la Enzina’s eclogues. It was probably\r\ncommenced in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella; though some authors\r\nassign this singular production of popular descriptive talent and well\r\nmeant plainness to the age of John II. The author is supposed to be\r\nRodrigo de Cota, to whom the pastoral dialogue of Mingo Rebulgo is also\r\nattributed. This dramatic romance was continued and completed at the\r\ncommencement of the fifteenth century by Fernando de Roxas, who has\r\nrecorded his own name in the initials of the introductory stanzas.[129]\r\nFernando de Roxas did not possess the forcible descriptive powers of\r\nthe unknown author, though he appears to have fully entered into the\r\nplan traced out by the latter. Either he or his precursor entitled the\r\nwork a tragi-comedy. It consists of twenty-one acts, and consequently\r\nits vast length renders it unfit for theatrical representation. This\r\nproduction may be regarded as original in a certain sense, for there\r\nexisted no work of the same kind which the author could have chosen\r\nas his model. But in a higher and truly critical point of view,\r\nit possesses as little originality as real poetic merit. Natural\r\ndescription and moral precept seem to have formed the great object\r\nof both authors. They both aimed at exhibiting a series of dramatic\r\nlessons to warn youth against the seductive arts of base agents\r\nemployed to promote intrigues. In order to attain this moral end, the\r\nauthors deemed it necessary to paint in glowing colours the disgusting\r\npicture of a brothel, and through a series of scenes unconnected by\r\nthe unities of time or place, to exhibit in the most striking point\r\nof view, the tragical end of an intrigue conducted by a woman of\r\ninfamous character. Owing to its moral object, the book has found\r\nadmirers in all ages, though many have not unreasonably conceived\r\nit more advisable to withdraw such scenes of vice from the eye of\r\nyouth, than to paint them with the minuteness and vivid colouring of\r\ntruth. But, even allowing that an inconsiderate young person may have\r\noccasionally been deterred from an intrigue by the sad history of\r\nCallistus and Melibœa, yet the whole dramatic tale, both in the subject\r\nand execution, is nevertheless revolting to good taste. The story is\r\nas follows:--Callistus, a young man of noble family, entertains a\r\nromantic passion for Melibœa. The young lady is also attached to him;\r\nbut her own prudence, as well as the strict observation to which she\r\nis subject in the house of her parents, prevents all communication\r\nbetween the lovers. In this difficulty, Callistus applies to an artful\r\nand abandoned woman, to whom the author has given the elegant name\r\nof Celestina. She easily devises a pretence for insinuating herself\r\ninto the house of Melibœa’s parents, where she succeeds in bribing the\r\nservants. The intrigue then proceeds in the most common manner, though\r\nthe author thinks it necessary to call in the aid of witchcraft and\r\nmagic. Callistus at length attains his object, and Melibœa’s parents\r\ndiscover the mischief when it is too late. Murder is committed among\r\nthe servants of Melibœa; Celestina’s house likewise becomes the scene\r\nof bloodshed; the profligate woman is herself murdered in the most\r\nhorrible manner imaginable; Callistus is assassinated, and Melibœa\r\ncloses the tragedy by throwing herself from the top of a lofty tower.\r\nSuch is the ground-work of the twenty-one acts of this tragi-comedy.\r\nIt must be admitted, that the authors appear to have wished to paint\r\nthe scenes in the house of Celestina in as decorous a manner as\r\nthe nature of the subject would permit. The profligate personages,\r\nparticularly Celestina, are drawn with great truth; and in the list of\r\nthe characters their description is unreservedly added to their names.\r\nThe first act, which is by the unknown author, is distinguished above\r\nthe rest for the easy flow of the dialogue.[130] Considered in this\r\npoint of view alone, the work is extremely interesting. It affords a\r\nfair proof that the fluent and natural style of conversation which the\r\ndramatic poets of the north did not attain, until after much labour\r\nand repeated failures, arose spontaneously in Spain, on the first\r\nattempt made by a writer of talent to make dramatic characters speak\r\nin prose.[131] This tragi-comedy, as it is styled, has, however, but\r\nlittle relation to poetry.[132]\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER ACCOUNT OF SPANISH PROSE.\r\n\r\nRISE OF THE HISTORICAL ART--EARLY PROGRESS OF THE EPISTOLARY STYLE.\r\n\r\nIn a history of Spanish prose of the fifteenth century, it would be\r\nimproper to omit a brief notice of the chronicles, which, in Spain, at\r\nthis period, were not written by monks, as in other parts of Europe,\r\nbut by knights, many of whom were at the same time poets. The custom\r\ninstituted by Alphonso X. of appointing historiographers to record\r\nthe most remarkable events of national history, was maintained by his\r\nsuccessors throughout the fourteenth century; and, in addition to\r\nthose historians, who were regularly appointed and paid, there arose\r\nothers in the fifteenth century, who wrote of their own accord from the\r\nlove of fame, or for the sake of doing honour to the parties to which\r\nthey were respectively attached. Historians were never held in such\r\nhigh estimation in modern Europe as they were at this time in Castile.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the fortunate circumstances which combined to\r\nrevive the taste for historical composition in Spain, the noble\r\nauthors of the Spanish chronicles in very few instances rose above\r\nthe vulgar chronicle style. They faithfully adhered to the language\r\nof the historical books of the bible. In nothing is their poetic\r\ntalent disclosed, except in a better choice of expression, than is\r\nto be found in the common chronicles, which were in general written\r\nby monks. Spirited and adequate historical description was totally\r\nunknown to them. They all wrote in nearly the same manner. Facts\r\nwere heaped on facts, in long monotonous sentences, which uniformly\r\ncommenced with the conjunction _and_. Occasionally, indeed, the writers\r\nof these chronicles seem to have made attempts to imitate the ancient\r\nhistorians; for at every favourable opportunity little speeches are\r\nput into the mouths of the characters they record; but these speeches\r\nare given either in the language of scripture or the law. Thus wrote\r\nthe illustrious Perez de Guzman, who was celebrated among the poets of\r\nhis age; and thus wrote the grand Chancellor of Castile, Pedro Lopez\r\nde Ayala, who is better known than the former as an historian, in\r\nconsequence of having compiled from ancient chronicles a connected\r\nhistory of the kings of Castile of the fourteenth century.[133]\r\n\r\nAn agreeable surprise is, however, excited in discovering among these\r\nchronicles some biographical works, one of which was probably written\r\nin the last years of the fourteenth century, and another, doubtless,\r\nbelongs to the fifteenth. These two productions deserve to be noticed,\r\nbut in a rhetorical point of view neither can be very highly estimated.\r\nThe first is the history of Count Pedro Niño de Buelna, one of the\r\nbravest knights of the reign of Henry III. The author is Gutierre Diez\r\nde Games, who was the Count’s standard-bearer.[134] The gothic taste\r\nof the age, it must be confessed, is sufficiently apparent in this\r\nhistory. The chivalrous author begins by apostrophizing the Trinity\r\nand the Holy Virgin. He then reasons methodically on virtue and vice,\r\naccording to the scholastic notions of morality. It is, however,\r\neasy to perceive that the author has taken great pains to avoid the\r\ndry chronicle style. He evidently wished to give to the history of\r\nhis hero the interest of a romance. He did not, therefore, confine\r\nhimself very scrupulously to historical truth, and he has even blended\r\nfabulous stories in his narrative. But on the other hand he paints\r\nreal events with a degree of spirit of which no example is to be found\r\nin the chronicles; and some of his descriptions are so remarkable for\r\nprecision, and accuracy of expression, that they might be mistaken for\r\nthe production of a modern writer, if the simplicity of the ideas did\r\nnot betray the age to which the chivalrous author belonged.[135]\r\n\r\nThe second of these biographical works is the history of Count Alvaro\r\nde Luna. The author, whose name is not known, appears to have been\r\nin the Count’s service, and to have taken up the pen soon after the\r\nexecution of that extraordinary man, to raise a monument to his memory\r\nin defiance of his enemies.[136] The work is in fact an apology, in\r\nwhich the enthusiasm of the anonymous author for his hero carries him\r\nbeyond the bounds of historical calmness and of impartiality. But\r\nthis very enthusiasm gives the work a degree of rhetorical interest,\r\nwhich is wanting in the chronicles. Alvaro de Luna is regarded by his\r\napologist in his real character; namely, as the greatest, if not the\r\nmost disinterested man of his age in Spain: and it was the author’s\r\nintention that the animated picture he drew should mortify and shame\r\nthe powerful party which overthrew his hero. His zeal frequently\r\nbetrays him into declamatory pomp. But what other Spanish writer\r\nof that age could declaim with so much eloquence.[137] He is not,\r\nhowever, always declamatory. His introduction, notwithstanding the\r\nhigh elevation of the ideas, possesses real dignity of expression,\r\ncombined with the true harmony of prose.[138] His apostrophe to truth\r\nat the close of this introduction, is a genuine overflowing of the\r\nheart.[139] It is true that the narrative itself somewhat inclines to\r\nthe manner of the chronicles; but the spirit which pervades the whole\r\nwork is perceptible even in the style which, considered with reference\r\nto the period in which it was written, is remarkable for precision and\r\nfacility.[140] In short, this biographical chronicle, estimated by\r\nits rhetorical merit, has, in spite of all its gothic ornaments and\r\ndeclamatory excrescences, no parallel among the chronicles of the age\r\nto which it belongs.\r\n\r\n_Los Claros Varones_, the Celebrated Men, is a work which claims\r\nparticular attention. The author is Fernando del Pulgar, who filled\r\nthe office of historiographer in the reign of Isabella and Ferdinand.\r\nThis ingenious man was ambitious to be thought the Plutarch of his\r\nnation. In his twenty-six short biographical sketches, he has, however,\r\nconfined himself within limits too narrow to effect all that he was\r\ncapable of; but the precision of his descriptions, and the purity\r\nof his style, are nevertheless remarkable for the age in which he\r\nflourished.[141]\r\n\r\nFernando del Pulgar is also the oldest Castilian author in the\r\nepistolary style; and upon the whole he may be regarded as the first,\r\nwho, in the character of a statesman and public functionary, formed\r\nhis correspondence in a modern language on the model of Cicero and\r\nPliny.[142]\r\n\r\nThose who have time and opportunity to peruse Spanish manuscripts of\r\nthe fifteenth century, will doubtless find many more documents to prove\r\nthe high degree of cultivation which Spanish prose had attained at that\r\nperiod. In spite of the lofty poetic flight which then characterized\r\nthe genius of Spain, and the powerful charm of the poetic prose of the\r\nchivalrous romances, the national gravity of the Spaniards, when their\r\nminds were directed, not to sports of the imagination, but to things,\r\nmade them incline to what may be termed the style of affairs, in\r\nthe same degree as the genius of the Italians, which attached itself\r\nexclusively to beautiful forms, had been accustomed to manifest an\r\nindifference for true prose. The philosophic writings of Aristotle\r\nwere, in the same age, translated into Spanish by a scholar, whose\r\nname, as well as his work, have fallen into oblivion.[143]\r\n\r\n\r\nJUAN DE LA ENZINA’S ART OF CASTILIAN POETRY.\r\n\r\nThe literature of this period possesses, however, not the slightest\r\ntrace of true criticism. Though the poetical and rhetorical rules of\r\nAristotle were known to a few scholars, they were of little utility\r\nto writers who either applied them erroneously, or considered them\r\nimpracticable. Of the state of poetry in Spain, during the reign\r\nof Ferdinand and Isabella, a correct notion may be formed from a\r\nTreatise on Castilian Poetry, (_Arte de Poesia Castellana_,) by Juan\r\nde la Enzina. In this work, addressed to the Prince Royal of Spain,\r\nthe author wished to prove that he thoroughly understood the art on\r\nwhich he wrote, and that he was not an unskilful Troubadour.[144] The\r\ncommencement of the treatise might teach the reader to expect some\r\nprofound investigation. Juan de la Enzina observes, “that poetry is so\r\nexcellent an art, that it merits the particular favour of princes and\r\nnobles”, who being reared “in the bosom of sweet philosophy,”[145]\r\nknow how to unite the virtues both of peace and war; it was therefore,\r\nhe continues, his intention to write a theory (_arte_) of Castilian\r\npoetry, which might facilitate the distinction between good and bad.\r\nHe treats of the origin of poetry among the ancients and among the\r\nItalians, and marks the difference between a poet and a Troubadour. The\r\nformer, he says, is, with respect to the latter, “what a composer or\r\nlearned musician is to a singer or musical performer, a geometrician to\r\na mason, or a captain to a private soldier.”[146] After all these high\r\npromises, Juan de la Enzina merely gives an Essay on Castilian prosody\r\nin a few chapters. Such is his art of poetry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus did Castilian poetry and eloquence develope itself in the\r\nancient national forms, during the first centuries that succeeded its\r\nbirth, without any superior genius having either raised it to higher\r\nperfection, or enlarged its boundaries. Like the _Gaya Ciencia_ of\r\nthe Troubadours, it was a common property, protected by a literary\r\ndemocracy, which allowed no despotic genius to encroach upon its\r\nrights. It is difficult to imagine what might have been the fate of\r\nCastilian poetry, had not a new political connection formed between\r\nSpain and Italy, at the commencement of the sixteenth century, suddenly\r\nbrought the Spanish nation, as it were in mass, in contact with the\r\nItalians. At all events, the Spaniards must, in the progress of\r\ncultivation, have ceased to be satisfied with the poetry of their old\r\nsongs and romances, on their literary taste becoming in any way more\r\nrefined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nFROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SIXTEENTH TO THE LATTER HALF OF THE\r\nSEVENTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n    GENERAL VIEW OF THE STATE OF POETICAL AND RHETORICAL CULTIVATION\r\n    IN SPAIN DURING THE ABOVE PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe union of the kingdoms of Castile and Arragon, in consequence of\r\nthe marriage of Isabella, the heiress of the Castilian throne, with\r\nFerdinand king of Arragon, forms an epoch in Spanish literature, as\r\nwell as in Spanish power. Hitherto Spain had been occupied only with\r\nher own internal affairs. The monarchs contended for their prerogatives\r\nwith the powerful barons of their respective states; and the two\r\nkingdoms waged war against each other. The only object which they\r\npursued in common, was the overthrow of the Moorish principality of\r\nGranada, which was enabled to resist them, as long as their political\r\njealousy of each other counter-balanced their mutual zeal for religion\r\nand conquest. Spain, in her detached situation to the west of the\r\nPyrenees, never appeared so completely separated from the rest of\r\nEurope as in the middle of the fifteenth century. With Italy, Spain\r\nmaintained no relations, except such as were purely ecclesiastical.\r\nA marked change, however, took place on the union of the crowns of\r\nCastile and Arragon, though the union of the two monarchies was not\r\nproperly consolidated until after Ferdinand’s death, which happened in\r\n1516. Since the year 1492, Granada had been a Castilian province. The\r\npoets had no longer the feats of the Zegris and Abencerrages to record;\r\nand the Spanish knights had no infidels to vanquish, unless they\r\ntravelled to Africa in quest of them. If, however, they were successful\r\nin that quarter of the world, their victories did not present subjects\r\nof such interest to the Castilian muse as former achievements had\r\nafforded. The love of industry and social order, which distinguished\r\nthe people of Arragon, at length extended to Castile; and the old\r\nchivalrous spirit declined in proportion as the use of gunpowder, which\r\nwas at this period rapidly increasing, became more general. The manners\r\nof the Spaniards of both monarchies, had now approximated to those\r\nof the Italians; and the analogy between the Castilian and Italian\r\nlanguages, could not fail to be remarked, whenever opportunities for\r\nmaking that observation occurred. Ferdinand soon afforded such an\r\nopportunity; his ambition induced him to take an active part in the\r\ntransactions of Italy, and his interference was attended with success.\r\nThe victorious Gonsalvo Fernandez de Cordova, admired as the conqueror\r\nof Granada, and a second Cid, and surnamed, by way of distinction, _El\r\ngran Capitan_, presented the crown of Naples to his sovereign in the\r\nyear 1504. The political union which then took place between Spain and\r\nItaly, and which continued longer than a century, paved the way for\r\nthat influence of the Italian poetry on the Spanish, which soon after\r\nbecame manifest.\r\n\r\nAbout the same period that Ferdinand and Isabella united their\r\ndominions, they also co-operated in the establishment of that terrible\r\ntribunal which soon became known throughout Europe by the name of\r\nthe Spanish Inquisition, and which to the disgrace of human reason\r\nexercised during two centuries and a half its monstrous powers in\r\ntheir fullest extent. A crafty policy contrived to render religion\r\nits instrument, in subjugating to one common tyranny the reason and\r\nthe rights of mankind; for the establishment of regal despotism in\r\nboth kingdoms was the great object of this institution, and its whole\r\norganization corresponded with the end for which it was destined.\r\nThe pope, who penetrated the design of the founders, viewed their\r\nproceedings with much dissatisfaction; but even the pope was obliged\r\nto support the pretended interest of the church, and to honour\r\nFerdinand by bestowing on him, as a peculiar distinction, the title\r\nof “Catholic King.” Thus the court of Rome contributed to annul the\r\nprivileges of the Cortes of Castile and Arragon, and to invest the\r\nwhole powers of government, without limitation, in the hands of an\r\nabsolute monarch: and thus did political artifice triumph over the\r\nenergy of one of the noblest nations in the world, at the very moment\r\nwhen the genius of that nation had begun to expand, when the promising\r\nflower had burst forth from the bud, and was about to unfold itself in\r\nfull vigour and beauty. A simultaneous and concordant cultivation of\r\nthe different powers of the human mind was now as little to be hoped\r\nfor in Spain as the improvement of her political constitution. Under\r\nthese circumstances the literary genius of the country could not be\r\nexpected to reach that high maturity of taste which always presupposes\r\na certain degree of harmony in the moral and intellectual faculties.\r\nPoetic freedom was circumscribed by the same shackles which fettered\r\nmoral liberty. Thoughts which could not be expressed without fear of\r\nthe dungeon and the stake, were no longer materials for the poet to\r\nwork on. His imagination instead of improving them into poetic ideas,\r\nand embodying them in beautiful verse, had to be taught to reject them.\r\nBut the eloquence of prose was more completely bowed down under the\r\ninquisitorial yoke than poetry, because it was more closely allied to\r\ntruth, which, of all things, was the most dreaded.\r\n\r\nThe yoke of this odious tribunal weighed, however, far less heavily on\r\nthe imagination than on the other faculties of the mind; and it must\r\nbe confessed that a wide field still remained open for the range of\r\nfancy, though the boundaries of religious doctrine were not permitted\r\nto be overstepped. To suppose that the Spanish inquisition could have\r\nentirely annihilated the poetic genius of the nation, it must also be\r\nsupposed, that at the period of its establishment, there had existed\r\na style of poetry altogether hostile to such an institution, and that\r\nthe spirit of the inquisition was directly opposed to the spirit of\r\nthe nation. But it would be forming a false notion of the horrors of\r\nthe inquisition, to imagine that they were ever felt in Spain in the\r\nsame manner as in other countries, and particularly in the Netherlands,\r\nwhere that tribunal was introduced hand in hand with foreign despotism.\r\nWhen the inquisition was established in Spain, it harmonized to all\r\nappearance, that is to say, as far as orthodox faith was concerned,\r\nwith the prevailing opinions of the Spanish Christians. It was\r\nostensibly directed not so much against heretics as against infidels,\r\nnamely, Mahometans and Jews. Its operations were accordingly commenced\r\nby waging war against those infidels, for no sect of Christian heretics\r\nexisted at that period in Spain, and the inquisition took care that\r\nnone should be afterwards formed. To maintain the purity of the\r\nancient faith was the avowed object of the inquisition; and its wrath\r\nwas poured out on the unfortunate Jews, Moors, and Moriscos, (the\r\ndescendants of the Moors), with the view of removing every blemish\r\nfrom the faith of a nation, which prided itself in its orthodoxy. This\r\nbigotted pride was a consequence of the contest maintained in Spain\r\nduring four centuries and a half, between Catholic Christianity and\r\nMahometanism. The Spanish Christians celebrated the conquest of Granada\r\nas the triumph of the church; and the inquisition, which at first\r\nexcited terror, soon became an object of veneration with men in whose\r\nhearts religious enthusiasm was inseparably blended with patriotism.\r\n\r\nThis view of the subject may serve to explain how it happened in the\r\nsequel, and particularly during the reign of Philip II. that while,\r\nthroughout all the rest of Europe men shuddered at the very name of the\r\nSpanish inquisition, the Spaniards still lived under it as happily\r\nand cheerfully as ever; and also how, from the operation of the same\r\ncause, the ecclesiastical shackles had not a more injurious effect on\r\nthe developement of the poetic genius of the nation. The conduct of the\r\ninquisition was no subject of alarm to those who were confident that\r\nthey never could have any personal concern with it; for the suspicion\r\nof deficiency in Catholic orthodoxy, the ground on which that tribunal\r\nacted, was more degrading in Spain than the most odious crimes in other\r\ncountries. Before the establishment of the inquisition, fanaticism was\r\nso firmly rooted in the minds of the Spaniards, that all scepticism\r\nin matters of religion was abhorred as a deadly sin. He, however,\r\nwho submitted with blind devotion to the decrees of the church, was\r\nheld to have a clear conscience, and in that sort of clear conscience\r\nthe Spaniards prided themselves. The inquisition disturbed the good\r\nCatholic as little in his social enjoyments, as criminal justice the\r\ncitizen who lived in conformity with the laws. The Spaniard was cruel\r\nonly to heretics and infidels, because he thought it his duty to hate\r\nthem; but in the orthodox bosom of his native country, he was animated\r\nby a spirit of gaiety of which the literature of Spain presents\r\nabundant proofs. While the Duke of Alba in the Netherlands ruled\r\nwith the axe of the executioner, Cervantes, in Spain, wrote his Don\r\nQuixote, and Lope de Vega, who himself held a post connected with the\r\ninquisition, produced his admirable comedies. The dramatic literature\r\nof Spain flourished with most brilliancy during the reigns of the\r\nthree Philips, from 1556 to 1665, and that is precisely the period\r\nwhen the Spanish inquisition exercised its power with the greatest\r\nrigour and the most sanguinary cruelty. Many melancholy traces of\r\nfanaticism are certainly observable in the literature of Spain during\r\nthe reigns of the three Philips; but those traces are so insulated, and\r\nthe painful impression which they naturally produce on liberal minds\r\nis so far compensated, by the noblest traits of humanity, that to him,\r\nwho, from reading the works of the Spanish poets, should turn to the\r\nperusal of the political history of the Spaniards during the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries, and particularly to the history of their\r\ntransactions in the Netherlands and America, it might well appear that\r\nhe had become acquainted with two distinct nations.\r\n\r\nIndeed, notwithstanding the generally prejudicial effects of the\r\nrestrictions imposed by the inquisition on intellectual freedom,\r\nthose restrictions could not fail, under the circumstances which have\r\nbeen described, to prove in one respect favourable to the polite\r\nliterature of Spain. The poetic genius which, at the period of the\r\nestablishment of this tribunal, was energetically developing itself\r\nthroughout the Peninsula, was not now to be annihilated. Its strength\r\nwas even augmented by that growing national pride, which the union of\r\nthe Castilian and Arragonian monarchies fostered. During the period\r\nmarked by the reign of Charles I. better known by his Germanic imperial\r\ntitle of Charles V. which was nearly half a century, namely, from the\r\nyear 1516 to the year 1555, the Austrian and Spanish monarchies were\r\nalso united, and Spain acquired rich possessions in a new quarter of\r\nthe world. The Spanish arms were not so victorious under the three\r\nPhilips as under Charles V. But, sacrificed as this gallant nation was\r\nto fanaticism and the most despicable of governments, its spirit never\r\nsunk under disaster, and its genius vented itself in the cultivation\r\nof poetry, because it was excluded by religious despotism from every\r\ngraver study, except the scholastic philosophy of the convent. It\r\nis also to be considered, that the influence of the ever debasing\r\ndespotism of the Spanish government could operate only gradually in\r\nextinguishing the energies of national genius. The bold manifestation\r\nof the spirit of freedom in Castile and Arragon on the accession\r\nof Charles V. was attended with discouraging results, because the\r\nnobility and the third estate did not unite in support of their common\r\ninterests. Had that union existed, Spain would probably have presented\r\nthe first model of a constitutional, and at the same time a vigorous\r\nmonarchy. That honour was withheld by fate: but the genius of the\r\nSpanish people was not so easily suppressed as their political and\r\nreligious freedom. Kings might rule as they pleased; they might madly\r\nshed the blood of their subjects, or waste the treasures drawn from\r\nAmerica; but the people, who had yielded to despotism only for the sake\r\nof religion, continued in their hearts to be what they had always been,\r\ntill the influence of time consummated their subjugation. The Spanish\r\npatriot, who fought in the cause of his king and country, was until\r\nthen, in his own estimation, still a free man. Kings received homage in\r\nverse as well as in prose; but a court poetry, like that which existed\r\nin France in the reign of Lewis XIV. was never known in Spain. The\r\nkings of Spain, too, never bestowed any very liberal encouragement\r\non the poetic literature of their country. Charles V. honoured a few\r\nSpanish and Italian poets with some degree of attention, according to\r\nthe fashion of the princes of that age; for in the sixteenth century a\r\npoet was accounted an extremely useful man for business of every sort;\r\nbut that sovereign seems to have taken a more particular interest in\r\nItalian than in Spanish literature. Philip II. from his joyless throne,\r\noccasionally cast a glance of favour on a man of talent; but restless\r\nambition and blind bigotry occupied his gloomy mind, and deprived him\r\nof all susceptibility for the beautiful. His son, Philip III. though of\r\na more amiable character, was too indolent to take a warm interest in\r\nany thing whatever. Philip IV. however, did more for Spanish literature\r\nthan any of his predecessors since the time of John II. His taste for\r\npomp and splendour, to which he thoughtlessly gave himself up, while\r\ndecay and disorder preyed upon the vitals of the state, disposed\r\nhim to favour the Spanish theatre. Calderon, whom he pensioned, was\r\nindebted to him for that leisure which enabled him to devote his life\r\nto dramatic poetry. But Calderon only improved on the labours of\r\npredecessors, who, without receiving the pay of kings, produced works\r\nwhich did honour to the nation, and were approved and rewarded by the\r\npublic. Spanish literature owes nothing to kings, and has to thank only\r\nthe popular spirit for all its brightest flowers. The drama, therefore,\r\nremained wholly national, even after the imitation of Italian forms\r\nhad long prevailed in the lyric and epic poetry of Spain. Writers\r\nfor the stage must of necessity obey the voice of a public possessing\r\nsufficient energy of character to condemn every piece which does not\r\npay homage to the popular taste. The whole history of the Spanish\r\ntheatre exhibits this dominion of the public over authors; and the\r\nparticular taste of the dramatists being formed under the influence\r\nof the general poetic genius of the nation, they very willingly, like\r\nLope de Vega, followed the stream, even though, like him, they well\r\nknew what the true theory of their art required. The cultivation of\r\nprose was more completely left to the individual taste of the authors;\r\nbut any instance of encouragement from the throne was as uncommon with\r\nrespect to it as to poetry. Antonio de Solis, who received a pension\r\nfrom Philip IV. as historiographer, for writing the History of Spanish\r\nAmerica, was indebted for that honour in some measure to his reputation\r\nas a poet, and his various acquirements, but by no means for any\r\nparticular esteem he had obtained on account of his talent for prose\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this period, however, intellectual talents were\r\nnever undervalued, either by the kings, or the nobles of Spain. In\r\nthat country, as well as in Italy, the higher orders considered it a\r\nduty to seek distinction through learning, and poetry was the soul\r\nboth of Spanish and Italian literature. Most of the Spanish poets of\r\nthis period, if not of noble birth, belonged, at least, to families of\r\nconsideration. Heroes, statesmen, ecclesiastics, all composed verses,\r\nand poetry was most intimately interwoven with all the relations of\r\nsocial life. No where did chivalrous gallantry so long survive the\r\nextinction of real chivalry as in Spain; and poetry was the exhaustless\r\nlanguage of that gallantry, whether it displayed itself in secret\r\nlove intrigues, or at public entertainments and festivals. Every\r\ncharacteristic national amusement, as for instance, a bull fight,\r\nproved an incitement to the writing of sonnets and romances. There\r\nare found in various Spanish poems of this period many expressions\r\nand allusions which have reference to popular amusements, but the\r\npoetic sense of which is only intelligible to readers who bear in\r\ntheir recollection the favourite diversions of the nation. The\r\nromantic intrigues which were common in high life, formed models for\r\nthe intricate plots of the Spanish comedies; but no ordinary powers\r\nof invention were necessary to enable the dramatic author to maintain\r\non the stage a competition with the scenes which actually occurred\r\nin society. Throughout the whole country, singing and dancing were\r\nessential ingredients in every amusement. Learned musical composition\r\nhad, at this time, little attraction for the Spaniards; but wherever\r\njoy was, musicians were not wanting, and every dance had its song.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the cultivation of the other fine arts, afforded\r\nlittle aid to Spanish poetry, as the overwhelming interest attached to\r\nit in its golden age directed the intellectual energies of the nation\r\nalmost exclusively to that one object. All other liberal pursuits were\r\nconsequently left far behind.\r\n\r\nSpanish taste was, at this period, entirely left to form itself, being\r\nabandoned to the influence of Italian literature, and the authority of\r\neminent national authors. The Italian system of academies found little\r\nfavour in Spain. Perhaps the jealousy of the inquisition foreboded evil\r\nfrom meetings of men of letters. Be this as it may, Spanish literature\r\nsustained little loss by the want of those institutions. The Royal\r\nAcademy for the Spanish language and literature was not established\r\nuntil the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe intimate union, which, during the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies, subsisted between the eloquence of prose and poetry in\r\nSpain, renders a separate history of each unnecessary. A division\r\nmay, however, be advantageously made in the whole body of the Spanish\r\nliterature of this period, though the two sections cannot form two\r\ndistinct epochs. From the introduction of the Italian style into\r\nSpanish poetry, until the decline of learning in the latter years of\r\nthe reign of Philip IV. no literary revolution was experienced in\r\nSpain. The _corrupters of taste_, as certain writers who appeared\r\nin the latter half of this period are called by some of the Spanish\r\ncritics, only continued a movement, the impulse of which had been given\r\nlong before by various authors, and particularly by the dramatic poets.\r\nSeveral of these writers were contemporaries with authors who placed\r\na high value on classical correctness, and yet they exercised a much\r\ngreater influence over the general literature of Spain than the latter.\r\nTo confound Calderon, who perfected the Spanish comedy, according to\r\nits true national character, with the corrupters of taste, is an idea\r\nwhich could only have been entertained in the eighteenth century,\r\nwhen it became customary in Spain, as every where else, to measure all\r\nproductions of genius by the rules of French criticism. But at the same\r\ntime, that Spanish poetry approximated as closely to the Italian, as\r\nthe necessary connection of the former with the national style would\r\npermit, that national style, with all its faults and beauties, still\r\nmaintained the pre-eminence; and the passion for Italian correctness\r\nagain declined. This crisis in Spanish literature, occasioned by the\r\nstruggle between Italian refinement and the bold eccentricity of the\r\nnational manners, occurred in the age of Cervantes. At that time Lope\r\nde Vega shone with more brilliancy in the eyes of his countrymen than\r\nCervantes, and the party of the former gained the victory and kept the\r\nfield. The taking of a distinct view of the progress of poetry and\r\neloquence in Spain, will therefore be facilitated, if the period of the\r\ninfluence of Cervantes and Lope de Vega be made an historical resting\r\npoint. It is doubtless very remarkable, that Cervantes, who created an\r\nepoch in the general literature of Europe, should not have produced\r\nsufficient effect on the Literature of his own country, to justify the\r\nchoosing him as the founder of a new epoch in its literary history. An\r\nopportunity will hereafter arise for reverting to this subject.[147]\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SECTION.\r\n\r\n    _History of Spanish Poetry and Eloquence, from the Introduction\r\n    of the Italian Style to the Age of Cervantes and Lope de Vega._\r\n\r\n\r\nOCCASION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ITALIAN STYLE.\r\n\r\nAfter the complete consolidation of the monarchies of Castile and\r\nArragon by the accession of Charles of Austria, the grandson of\r\nIsabella and Ferdinand, there appears to have been, for a short\r\ntime, a suspension of all literary activity in Spain. The political\r\nconvulsions which then agitated the interior of the two united\r\nkingdoms, occupied the public mind too powerfully to allow any interest\r\nto be felt in calmer and more agreeable objects. But as soon as the\r\ncivil contests were terminated by the success of the Austrian party,\r\nand the enterprising Charles, incited by Francis I. employed the force\r\nof his Spanish states to win new dominions in Italy, the poetic genius\r\nof Spain revived in all its pristine vigour. In the meantime, the\r\nancient dialect of the Arragonian provinces began to be supplanted\r\nby the Castilian, which became the language of the state and of\r\npublic business throughout Spain. Castile was then considered the\r\nheart of the whole monarchy. Madrid rose to the rank of the capital\r\nof Spain, and Saragossa sunk into the condition of a provincial town.\r\nIt was therefore no very extraordinary event, that a Catalonian,\r\nwhose maternal language still possessed a certain degree of poetic\r\nconsideration, should, in connection with a Castilian, produce a\r\nrevolution in Castilian poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSCAN.\r\n\r\nJuan Boscan Almogavèr, who, in concert with his friend Garcilaso de\r\nla Vega, introduced the Italian style into Castilian poetry, was born\r\nin Barcelona, towards the close of the fifteenth century. He belonged\r\nto one of the Patrician families of that city, of equal rank with\r\nthe nobility of the country. Though possessing a liberal education,\r\nand sufficient fortune to enable him to gratify his inclination for\r\nliterary studies, without regard to any secondary views, he embarked,\r\nnotwithstanding, on his first outset in life for a short period in\r\nthe profession of arms. He afterwards travelled, but the countries he\r\nvisited are not mentioned in the brief notices which remain of him.\r\nIf, however, it be supposed that he went at this time to Italy, and\r\nrendered himself intimately acquainted with the literature of that\r\ncountry, it appears that he was still far from entertaining the idea\r\nof transplanting the forms and manner of Italian poetry into Spain;\r\nfor the Castilian verses, which he wrote in his youth, were all in\r\nthe ancient lyric style, which, since the time of Juan de Mena no one\r\nhad thought it necessary to try to improve. It was not until 1526,\r\nwhen, after having flourished at the court of Charles V. he had made\r\na happy marriage, and was settled in his native city, that a Venetian\r\ninduced him to imitate the Italian poetry in the Castilian language.\r\nThe emperor resided for some time in Granada; and, among the foreign\r\nministers who repaired to his court, was Andrea Navagero, the envoy\r\nfrom Venice, a man of great literary and historical knowledge, and,\r\nlike every well-educated Italian of that age, a writer of canzoni\r\nand sonnets. Boscan, having formed an intimate friendship with this\r\nminister, was taught by him to view the Italian poetry and also the\r\nclassical latin in quite a new light. The Spanish lyric poetry, which\r\nwith all its gothic excrescences was still pleasing to the nation,\r\nif not so barbarous in his eyes as in those of his Italian friend,\r\nappeared to him, when compared with a sonnet of Petrarch, at least,\r\nin the point of good taste greatly inferior. He now readily perceived\r\nthe nature and felt the value of the precision and correctness of the\r\ngreat works of antiquity. Animated by his new ideas, he fearlessly\r\nventured to follow the counsel of Navagero, in spite of the menacing\r\nclamour of the friends of the old national forms. He took upon himself\r\nthe character of a reformer of the lyric poetry of his nation, and\r\ncommenced his labours by writing sonnets in the manner of Petrarch.\r\n\r\nThe metrical structure of the sonnet had long been known in Spain;[148]\r\nbut the genius of Castilian poetry was adverse to that form, and the\r\nSpaniards had manifested very little predilection for any thing like\r\nthe elegant correctness of Petrarch. Boscan had therefore elevated\r\nhimself above the literature of his country, when he perceived that it\r\nwas necessary to infuse a new spirit into Castilian poetry before it\r\ncould be reconciled to the Italian forms. His friend Garcilaso de la\r\nVega participated in this opinion. But thousands of voices were raised\r\nagainst the reformers. Some insisted that preference was to be given to\r\nthe old Castilian verse on the ground of euphony. Others went further,\r\nand asserted that the ear could perceive no distinction between the\r\nnew verse and prose. Finally, a third party discovered that Italian\r\npoetry was effeminate, and was fit only for Italians and women. Boscan\r\nrelates that this violent opposition made him reflect seriously on the\r\npropriety of proceeding with his design; but as he was soon convinced\r\nof the futility of the reasons urged against him, he persisted in\r\nhis undertaking. His party rapidly increased and soon obtained the\r\nsuperiority, not indeed throughout the whole mass of the public, but in\r\nthat portion of society which was most enlightened and refined.[149]\r\n\r\nThe other circumstances of Boscan’s life, in so far as they are known,\r\nhave little interest for the literary historian. The mature part of\r\nhis age was chiefly spent in his native city Barcelona, or in the\r\nneighbouring country. The urbanity of his manners and his talents\r\nrecommended him to the family of Alba, which was then one of the most\r\nbrilliant of the noble houses of Castile, and to which the homage of\r\nthe Spanish poets was from that time constantly paid. Boscan was for\r\nsome time Ayo, or first governor of the young Don Fernando de Alba,\r\nwho was afterwards the terror of the enemies of the Spanish monarchy.\r\nHe appears, however, to have soon resigned this employment, in order\r\nto divide his time between study and the society of literary friends.\r\nThe year in which he died is not exactly known; it is only ascertained\r\nthat his death happened before the year 1544.[150] He prepared for the\r\npress a collection of his poems, to which he added those of his friend\r\nGarcilaso; but the work was not published until after his death.[151]\r\n\r\nFrom the point at which Boscan found Castilian poetry, to that in\r\nwhich it was necessary it should be placed before he could open for\r\nhimself a new path, the distance was considerable, and the transition\r\nwas to be accomplished by a single bound. That he succeeded in this\r\nundertaking was owing not so much to his genius, as to a natural\r\nsusceptibility for the real beauties of Italian and ancient poetry,\r\naccidentally excited at the favourable moment, and to a talent for\r\nthe imitation of classical models, without altogether discarding that\r\ntone of feeling which was properly his own. To estimate, however, the\r\nfull value of Boscan’s talent, it is not only necessary to examine\r\nthe works by which he introduced a new style into Spanish poetry,\r\nbut to take a retrospective view of the productions of the Castilian\r\nmuse in the ancient manner. It is only by this comparison that a just\r\nconception can be formed of the surprise with which the Spaniards\r\nmust have regarded the bold attempt of Boscan. He was the first among\r\nhis countrymen who had an idea of classical perfection in works of\r\nimagination; and though the greater part of his poems fall below that\r\nstandard, they all afford evidence of his endeavours to reach it. An\r\naspiration so entirely unaffected and unembarrassed, had never been\r\nmanifested by any previous Spanish poet. Between the kind of poetry\r\nwhich he introduced into his native land and that which he abandoned,\r\nthere was no visible passage. But lest the merits of Boscan should be\r\ntoo highly rated, it is proper to observe, that at this time a reform\r\nof the Spanish poetry, precisely such as that to which his efforts gave\r\nbirth, was, notwithstanding the clamour of his opponents, desired by\r\nthe more cultivated part of the Spanish public, though, perhaps, there\r\nno where existed any distinct perception of the wished-for object. Had\r\nit been otherwise, Boscan must have stood alone, and the numerous poets\r\nof his nation, who have equalled or surpassed him in the new style,\r\nnever would have followed his example.\r\n\r\nThe early productions of Boscan, which form the first book of his\r\nworks, are scarcely distinguishable by any trace of superior delicacy\r\nor correctness from the poems of the same descriptions contained in the\r\n_Cancionero general_. The very title of the longest of these youthful\r\nessays, namely, _Mar de Amor_ (the Sea of Love) excites an anticipation\r\nof the fantastic flights of the old Spanish muse; and it is impossible\r\nto read the first strophe without being convinced that the author still\r\nadhered to the original character of Castilian song.[152] It was,\r\nhowever, only at the request of his friend Garcilaso de la Vega, who\r\nsaid that he received from these poems the same sort of pleasure as\r\nfrom pretty children, that Boscan renounced his intention of entirely\r\nsuppressing them.\r\n\r\nThe second book of Boscan’s poems, contains _sonetos_ and _canciones_,\r\nin the style of the Italian _sonetti_ and _canzoni_. They all betray,\r\nin a greater or less degree, the disciple of the school of Petrarch;\r\nbut the spirit of Spanish poetry still displays itself throughout the\r\nwhole. The language, though it successfully imitates the precision\r\nof Petrarch, seldom attains the sweetly flowing melody of its model.\r\nIn painting the feelings, the shadows are charged with stronger\r\ncolours than the Italian Petrarchists of the sixteenth century\r\npermitted themselves to employ. Impetuous passion, which, with higher\r\npretensions, was, on account of its very violence, less capable of\r\ncommanding sympathy than a mild enthusiasm, strikingly distinguished\r\nBoscan’s poetry from that which was the object of his imitation. The\r\ncontrast was farther increased by the constantly recurring picture\r\nof a struggle between passion and reason. But these were precisely\r\nthe traits which disclosed the true Spanish character. It was not\r\nindividual feeling that prevented Boscan from equalling the delicacy\r\nand softness of the Italian sonetto and canzone, for as his biography,\r\nand still more his other poems, shew he was a man of a very mild\r\ndisposition. But it was necessary that the language of love, to appear\r\nnatural and true to a Spaniard, should burn and rage. At the same\r\ntime, to satisfy Spanish taste, reason was to be introduced to deliver\r\nher precepts amidst the storm of passion, to prove its force by her\r\nfeebleness, and to give to lyric composition a moral gravity which was\r\nnot desired by the Italians. In so far however as the Spanish character\r\npermitted the experiment to go, the fascinating tone of Petrarch was\r\nvery happily seized by Boscan;[153] and in the expression of tender\r\npassion he has even sometimes surpassed the Italian poet.[154]\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the third book of these poems is occupied by a\r\nparaphrastic translation of the Greek poem of Hero and Leander. Nothing\r\nof the kind had been previously known in the Spanish language. The\r\nmetrical form which Boscan chose for his translation, was that of\r\nrhymeless iambics, or an imitation of the blank verse of the Italians.\r\nThe language is so pure and elegant, the versification so natural, and\r\nthe tone of the narrative so soft, and at the same time so elevated,\r\nthat it is impossible not to be pleased even with the prolixity which\r\nthe influence of the taste for romantic poetry has introduced into\r\nthis free translation. To this translation succeeds a poem in the\r\nItalian style, entitled a _Capitulo_, and some epistles in tercets. The\r\n_Capitulo_, as it is called, is a love elegy, abounding in pleasing\r\nideas and images, but on the whole too much spun out, like most Italian\r\npoems of the same kind. It has also its full share of genuine Spanish\r\nhyperbole and amorous despair.[155] The best of his epistles is, “The\r\nAnswer to Diego Mendoza,” who was himself the first epistolary poet\r\namong the Spaniards, and whom it will soon be necessary to notice more\r\nat length. After the new poetical career was opened, these authors vied\r\nin imitating the epistles of Horace; but it is plain that the elegiac\r\ntenderness of Tibullus was constantly present to the mind of Boscan.\r\nIn his Answer to Mendoza, the descriptions of domestic and rural life\r\ncharm by their exquisite delicacy, and possess a still more powerful\r\ninterest than the moral reflections, though these are unaffected and\r\nnoble, and conceived in the true spirit of didactic poetry.[156]\r\n\r\nBoscan’s works conclude with a narrative poem in the Italian style,\r\nwhich has no other title than that which denotes the structure of the\r\nverse, namely, _octava rima_. Some ideas and images are borrowed from\r\nthe Italian poets; but the whole invention and the execution of the\r\ngreater part of the details belong to Boscan. The merit of the fable,\r\nhowever, is not great. A mythological allegory, describing the empire\r\nof love, forms the introduction to a poetical relation of a festal\r\nmeeting of Venus, Cupid, and the other inhabitants of that imaginary\r\nregion. Little Cupids are dispatched all over the world by Venus to\r\ndefend her against the reproaches of unreasonable men, and to make\r\nknown the real blessings of love. One of those winged envoys directs\r\nhis course towards Barcelona, the natal city of the poet, gives a\r\nparticular account of his mission to the fair ladies of that town, and\r\ntakes the opportunity of saying many gallant things to them. As to the\r\nconstruction of the fable of this poem, Boscan certainly gave himself\r\nvery little trouble. His object appears merely to have been to compose\r\na romantic picture of greater extent than a sonnet or a cancion, and to\r\nmake his countrymen sensible of the charm of descriptive poetry in the\r\nItalian manner. It is impossible not to admire the grace and facility\r\nwith which Boscan has accomplished this purpose. The descriptions are\r\nso animated,[157] and all the details so elegant and engaging, that\r\nthe tediousness of some of the parts is amply compensated by the happy\r\nexecution of the whole. Light plays of fancy embellish the lyric and\r\nromantic passages; and, upon the whole, this is a work which no other\r\nof the same kind by later Spanish poets has excelled.[158]\r\n\r\nIf a comprehensive view be taken of the merits of Boscan, it will be\r\nimpossible, notwithstanding the striking faults which appear in his\r\nworks, and particularly in his sonnets, to withhold from him the title\r\nof the first classical poet of Spain. Some of his expressions are\r\nnow antiquated, but upon the whole his language has continued a model\r\nfor succeeding ages. Simplicity and dignity had never, in the same\r\ndegree, and under a form so correct, been united with poetic truth\r\nand feeling by any previous Spanish author. The partizans of the old\r\nnational poetry reproached him with being an imitator; but without\r\nthe kind of imitation by which he naturalized in his language a taste\r\nfor the literature of Italy and the ancient classics, it would have\r\nbeen impossible for Spanish poetry to have gained that field in which\r\nit afterwards competed with the Italian. That he did not obtrude upon\r\nhis countrymen a kind of poetry irreconcilable with the genius of the\r\nlanguage and the national character, is evident from the rapidity\r\nwith which the new taste spread over the whole of Spain, and extended\r\ninto Portugal, and from its duration in both kingdoms. The poetic\r\ninnovators, at whose head Boscan stood, were certainly blameable, in so\r\nfar as they wished to banish entirely the ancient Spanish style, which\r\nwas also, in its own manner, susceptible of classical improvement. But\r\nit is doubtful whether the partizans of that style would have thought\r\nof perfecting it after classical models, had not the disciples of the\r\nItalian school unexpectedly shewn the high cultivation of which Spanish\r\npoetry was capable under new forms. This Boscan first made manifest,\r\nnot by critical reasoning, but by example; and his modesty contributed\r\nnot a little to attract to his party the more liberal minded of his\r\ncountrymen. Had he commenced his reform by trying to beat down the old\r\nstyle with theoretical argument, or egotistical declamation, he would\r\nonly have rendered himself an object of ridicule; for the public he had\r\nto deal with was not indisposed to improvement, but would not submit to\r\nhave lessons read to it magisterially.\r\n\r\nAfter Boscan, his friends, who participated in the fame of that reform\r\nto which he shewed the way, are justly entitled to the next place in\r\nthe history of Spanish poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARCILASO DE LA VEGA.\r\n\r\nThe first Spanish poet who followed the example of Boscan was Garcilaso\r\nde la Vega, a young Castilian, descended from a family of consideration\r\nin Toledo, and born, according to the statements of different authors,\r\neither in 1500 or 1503. His poetic talent was early developed, and he\r\nhad written several lyric pieces in the old Spanish style, when his\r\nacquaintance with Boscan, which soon grew into friendship, commenced.\r\nThe character of the poetry of the ancients and of Italy was then\r\nseen by him in a new light. He proceeded with ardour to the study\r\nof classical models, and of Petrarch and Virgil in particular. The\r\nimprovement of pastoral poetry in his native tongue, appears to have\r\nbeen his first object. But it was his lot to follow the restless\r\nprofession of arms; and the wars of Charles V. carried him abroad, and\r\ndragged him from country to country. In the year 1529, he distinguished\r\nhimself in the Spanish corps, which was attached to the imperial army\r\nopposed to the Turks. While in Vienna he was involved in a romantic\r\nintrigue, between a near relation of his own and a lady of the court.\r\nThe imperial dignity, it appears, was conceived to be compromised\r\nby this intrigue, and Garcilaso was punished for his interference by\r\nimprisonment in an Island of the Danube. There he composed one of\r\nhis canciones, in which he bewails his destiny, but at the same time\r\ncelebrates the Danube and the countries through which it flows.[159]\r\nHis imprisonment probably was not of long duration. In the year 1535,\r\nhe served in the adventurous expedition of Charles V. against Tunis,\r\nin which he acquired both glory and wounds. In Naples and Sicily,\r\nhe devoted, as far as circumstances would permit, his moments of\r\nrelaxation to poetry. He execrated war, and exerted all the powers\r\nof his imagination in painting an Arcadian pastoral life, but still\r\nremained a soldier.[160] It may be presumed, however, that his military\r\ntalents were not inconsiderable, for when the imperial army in the year\r\n1536, penetrated into the South of France, Garcilaso de la Vega, who\r\ncould then be only thirty-three, or at most thirty-six years of age,\r\ncommanded eleven companies of infantry. That campaign, which did not\r\nterminate so fortunately as it commenced, was the last to Garcilaso,\r\nand tore him from the world in the bloom of life. The emperor in person\r\nordered him to take by assault, a fort, the garrison of which harrassed\r\nthe army in its retreat. Garcilaso executed this command with more\r\ngallantry than prudence. He wished to be the first to scale the walls.\r\nHe attained his object, but was struck with a stone on the head, and\r\nthrown down from the ramparts. Being mortally wounded, he was removed\r\nto Nice, where, a few weeks after, he died.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to discover from the works of Garcilaso, that the\r\nauthor had spent a considerable portion of his short life in camps,\r\nand had died in the bed of military honour, the victim of his courage;\r\nfor he approaches even more closely than Boscan to the tenderness of\r\nPetrarch. The general tone of his poetry is so soft and melancholy,\r\nthat it is only by occasional characteristic traits, that the Spaniard\r\nis recognized; but it must be confessed that when such passages do\r\noccur, the exaggeration is striking enough.[161] In his sonnets,\r\nwhich are not numerous, the imitation of Petrarch is obvious; but he\r\nsometimes betrays that affectation of wit, which was still in Spain\r\nregarded as an ingenious manner of expressing vehement and profound\r\npassion.[162] One however exhibits throughout a delicacy of style and\r\nsweetness of manner, equalled by few pieces of the same kind, in the\r\nSpanish language.[163] He was not equally successful in seizing the\r\ncharacter of the Italian canzone, of which he, as well as Boscan, was\r\nan imitator; and his reputation rests chiefly on his pastoral poems,\r\nwhich therefore deserve to be more particularly noticed.\r\n\r\nSince the rude dramatic eclogues of Juan de la Enzina pastoral poetry\r\nhad made no progress in Spain. But Garcilaso de la Vega imitated Virgil\r\nand Sanazzar, and so happily united the romantic character with the\r\ncorrectness of the ancients, that his eclogues, though only one of\r\nthem can be regarded as a masterpiece, surpass all Italian poems of\r\nthe kind, those in the Arcadia of Sanazzar alone excepted. The fine\r\nNeapolitan sky appears to have had the same influence on Garcilaso\r\nas on Virgil and Sanazzar; and he seems to have regarded Naples as\r\nhis poetical country. The first of his eclogues is by far the most\r\nbeautiful, and marks an epoch in Spanish pastoral poetry. The whole\r\ncomposition has the metrical form of an Italian canzone. The invention\r\nis very simple. In the four introductory strophes, in which is\r\ninterwoven a dedication to the Viceroy of Naples, Don Pedro de Toledo,\r\nMarquis of Villafranca, the author describes, with all the simplicity\r\nwhich belongs to true pastoral poetry, the meeting of two shepherds,\r\nSalicio and Nemoroso, who alternately give vent to their feelings in\r\nmelancholy strains. These elegiac songs reply to each other without\r\ninterruption, and the relation subsisting between them gives to the\r\nwhole lyric composition a proper consistence and unity. This is all the\r\nplan of the eclogue. But the glow of enthusiastic feeling, the happy\r\nchoice of expression, and the harmony of versification so completely\r\nsatisfactory to the ear, to be found in almost every line of these\r\nsongs of sorrow, cannot fail to give delight to every mind susceptible\r\nof elegiac and beauty. Accordingly the Spanish critics are nearly\r\nunanimous in pronouncing this eclogue one of the finest works in their\r\nlanguage. The subject of the first song is the infidelity--of the\r\nsecond, the death of a mistress; and the latter complaint appears to be\r\nfounded in fact. But Garcilaso would have better secured the sympathy\r\nof the more scrupulous Spanish reader, had he entirely passed over the\r\ncause of the lamented fair one’s decease. The lady whom he describes as\r\na pastoral nymph, lost her life it seems in childbed; for an apostrophe\r\nof the complaining shepherd to Lucina, indicates plainly enough the\r\nnature of her death. But is the affected delicacy which takes offence\r\nat a trait so truly natural and pathetic, worthy of the attention of an\r\nauthor? In the first strain in which the shepherd Salicio deplores the\r\ninfidelity of his mistress, the interest appears to be raised as far\r\nas it is possible to carry it.[164] Passion is here elevated to the\r\nhighest pitch, and then lost in a most affecting self sacrifice.[165]\r\nBut the song in which Nemoroso laments the death of his mistress, even\r\nsurpasses the former in elegiac force, perhaps because it possesses\r\ngreater softness. In retracing his recollections the mourner draws a\r\nseries of melancholy pictures which have an indescribable charm. The\r\nbeauty of the poem rises with the description of the beauty of the\r\ndeparted shepherdess.[166] The passage in which Nemoroso relates how\r\nhe carries in his bosom a lock of his Eliza’s hair, from which he is\r\nnever separated--how when alone he spreads it out, weeps over it, dries\r\nit with his sighs, and then examines and counts every single hair--is\r\nunexampled either in ancient or modern literature.[167] Occasional\r\nimitations of Virgil have been pointed out, but they harmonize so\r\ncompletely with the romantic spirit of the poem, that were it not\r\nfor the particular references which critics have made, they would\r\nin general escape the notice of even the most erudite. The poem, as\r\na whole, is evidently the genuine offspring of the author’s soul.\r\nMaterials of an affecting but prosaic nature are, by his art, converted\r\ninto the most graceful and impressive poetry.\r\n\r\nAs Garcilaso only imitated the ancients by the introduction of certain\r\nideas and images, and not in the structure of his eclogues, he\r\nconsidered himself at liberty to vary their form at pleasure. But here\r\nhis good taste abandoned him. The second and longest of his eclogues is\r\nan unnatural mixture of heterogeneous styles. An unfortunate shepherd\r\ndeplores his unsuccessful love. Another shepherd joins him, and their\r\nconversation proceeds unconstrained in a romantic pastoral tone; but\r\nit is impossible to discover any reason for the changes which take\r\nplace in the verse. Tercets are succeeded by rhymeless iambics, after\r\nwhich the tercets re-appear and are followed by the syllabic measure\r\nof a canzone. The simple dialogue suddenly becomes dramatic. The fair\r\nhuntress, whose indifference is the subject of the first shepherd’s\r\nlament, appears upon the scene. The lover seizes and refuses to let\r\nher go, until she swears to listen to his addresses. She makes the\r\nrequired vow, and when at liberty flies. The despair of the shepherd\r\nthen becomes frenzy; and a third shepherd, who has in the mean time\r\narrived, enters into conversation with the one who first joined the\r\nunhappy lover, on the means of restoring him to reason. The author\r\nseizes this opportunity to convert his eclogue into a most unseasonable\r\neulogium on the house of Alba. One of the shepherds proposes that\r\nmedical assistance should be obtained, and mentions a physician named\r\nSevero; but this name is assigned to a learned friend of Garcilaso and\r\nthe Alba family. Nothing more is necessary, according to the critical\r\nconception of the author, to warrant the making a poetical digression\r\nfrom his account of the merits of the physician, whose miraculous skill\r\nis to recover the frantic shepherd, to the history of the house of\r\nAlba, which he details in iambic blank verse.\r\n\r\nIn the third and last of Garcilaso’s eclogues, the genuine pastoral\r\ncharacter is resumed. The lyric dialogue in octaves, or Italian\r\nstanzas, pleasingly harmonizes with the soft description of amatory\r\nsorrows given in this poem.\r\n\r\nGarcilaso made essays in other kinds of poetry, but with less success.\r\nAn elegy written to console the Duke of Alba for the death of his\r\nbrother, is an imitation, or rather a translation of an Italian poem by\r\nFrascatoro, and is at once cold and verbose. More of interest belongs\r\nto another elegy which is addressed to Boscan, and which the author\r\nwrote at the foot of Mount Etna. Mythological recollections excited\r\nby that classic ground, melancholy complaints of the miseries of war,\r\nand tender anxieties for a loved object in the poet’s native land,\r\ndiffuse a charm over the whole of this elegant poem, which is besides\r\nremarkable for comparisons and images full of novelty and truth.[168]\r\n\r\nGarcilaso is also the author of a small epistle in which he has\r\nendeavoured to seize the true horatian tone. It is not sufficiently\r\nimportant to deserve particular notice, but it is easy to recognize in\r\nit the fine tact of this author, to whom the critic, however severely\r\nhe may judge his faults, cannot deny the title of the second classic\r\npoet of Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIEGO DE MENDOZA.\r\n\r\nThe third classic poet, and at the same time the first classic prose\r\nwriter of Spain, is Don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza,[169] a native of\r\nGranada, where he was born in the beginning of the sixteenth century,\r\nbut in what year is not known. Descended from one of the first familes\r\nof the country, he had before him the prospect of high honours, which,\r\nas he was one of five children, his parents destined him to reach\r\nthrough the church. Being educated for the clerical profession, he\r\nreceived what was then considered a learned education. Besides the\r\nclassical languages of antiquity, he acquired the Hebrew and Arabic.\r\nAt the university of Salamanca, he studied scholastic philosophy,\r\ntheology, and ecclesiastical law. While yet a student he was the\r\ninventor of the comic romance or novel, for it was at Salamanca that\r\nhe wrote his celebrated work, the Life of Lazarillo de Tormes. Having\r\nbecome as conspicuous for a vigorous and sound understanding as for his\r\nwit and learning, the Emperor Charles V. who perceived that his talents\r\nmight be employed with advantage in public business, drew him from his\r\nstudies. He had not long left the university when he was appointed\r\nimperial envoy to Venice. He availed himself of the opportunities\r\nwhich this situation afforded to cultivate an intercourse with learned\r\nItalians, and to obtain an intimate knowledge of the spirit of\r\nItalian literature. Before his departure for Italy, he appears to have\r\nformed an acquaintance with Boscan; but he was patriot enough not to\r\ndespise the old Spanish poetry. Though he loved the Italian poets, he\r\npreferred the ancients, and in particular Horace, who, like himself\r\na man of the world, might occasionally assist him in his journey\r\nthrough the slippery path of political life; and certainly few poets\r\ncould have divided themselves between literature and politics with as\r\nmuch dexterity as Mendoza. He was, however, far from being a cringing\r\ncourtier. His low opinion of diplomatic dignity is stated frankly,\r\nand even somewhat coarsely, in one of his epistles, in which he\r\nexclaims:--“O these ambassadors, the perfect ninnies! when kings wish\r\nto cheat they begin with us. Our best business is to take care that we\r\ndo no harm, and indeed never to do or say any thing that we may not\r\nrun the risk of making ourselves understood.”[170] The ambassador of a\r\nprince of such deep dissimulation as Charles V. might naturally enough\r\nform an unfavourable opinion of his office; but he who could speak his\r\nmind in this manner, even when at his post, must have retained some of\r\nthe spirit of old Spanish freedom.\r\n\r\nThe emperor made no mistake in the choice of his ambassador, of whose\r\nturn of thinking he doubtless was not ignorant, but on the exercise\r\nof whose talents he knew he could rely. He considered him the fittest\r\nperson that could be selected to go to the council of Trent, and\r\nrecommend, by an elegant manner, the truths he wished to be told to the\r\nassembled fathers in the name of the Spanish nation. This commission\r\nMendoza executed to the satisfaction of the emperor. The speech which\r\nhe delivered before the council in 1545 was highly admired, and\r\nCharles was convinced that it was impossible to confide the affairs\r\nof Italy to better hands. In the year 1547, Mendoza appeared at the\r\npapal court, then the centre of all political intrigues, as imperial\r\nambassador, and invested with powers which rendered him the terror\r\nof the French party in Italy. The emperor at the same time appointed\r\nhim captain-general and governor of Sienna, and other strong places\r\nin Tuscany. He was ordered to humble the pope, Paul III. even in his\r\nown court; and to repress, by force, the movements of the restless\r\nFlorentines, who still hoped, under the protection of France, to shake\r\noff the yoke of the Medicis. A man of less firmness of character would\r\nhave been totally unfit for such a task; but the terrible energy with\r\nwhich Mendoza performed it, exasperated in the highest degree the\r\nopposite party, and more particularly the Florentines. The repeated\r\ninsurrections in Tuscany could not be suppressed without measures of\r\ngreat severity, and Mendoza was consequently detested as a tyrant by\r\nall Italians who were not reconciled to the introduction of Spanish\r\ngarrisons. In Sienna he was constantly exposed to assassination; and on\r\none occasion, a musket ball directed against him killed the horse on\r\nwhich he rode. His intrepidity, however, was not to be shaken, and he\r\ncontinued to administer his difficult government until Paul III. died,\r\nand was succeeded by Julius III. a pope inclined to the Spanish party.\r\nThe new pope wishing to bestow on Mendoza a particular mark of respect,\r\nappointed him Gonfalonier, or Standard-bearer to the church. In this\r\ncharacter, Mendoza marched against the rebels in the ecclesiastical\r\nterritories, and made them submit to the pope.\r\n\r\nThus did a Spanish poet, alike feared and admired, govern Italy for\r\nthe space of six years. During this stormy period of his life, Mendoza\r\ncomposed verses, visited the Italian universities, purchased Greek\r\nmanuscripts, and collected a large library. Since the days of Petrarch\r\nno friend of literature had shewn so much zeal for the acquisition\r\nof Greek manuscripts. He spared no pains nor expense to procure them\r\neven from Greece, and sent special messengers for that purpose to\r\nthe convent of Mount Athos. He availed himself of a service he had\r\nrendered to the Ottoman sultan, to obtain supplies of corn for the\r\nempty granaries of Venice, and of manuscripts for his own library. Many\r\na Greek work came first to the press from his valuable collection.\r\nWhoever wished to promote the study of ancient literature, found in\r\nhim a friend and protector; and to him the learned bookseller, Paulus\r\nManutius, dedicated his edition of the philosophic writings of Cicero,\r\nto the study of which Mendoza was particularly attached, and for the\r\ncorrect publication of which he even made critical observations on the\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\nLiterature and politics, it appears, did not afford sufficient\r\noccupation for this extraordinary man. He chose also to engage in\r\naffairs of gallantry; and, according to the manners of the age, gave to\r\nsuch pursuits, at least in verse, the character of romantic passion.\r\nHis looks, however, were not calculated to recommend him to the fair\r\nsex; for his biographers state that he was far from handsome, and that\r\nthe glance of his fiery eye was more repulsive than inviting. But\r\nMendoza was active, accomplished, and in the possession of power; and\r\nthe favour which these advantages obtained for him with some Roman\r\nladies, was numbered among the offences with which his enemies loudly\r\nreproached him. The repeated charges brought against him made at last\r\nan impression on the emperor; and that monarch, who had begun to\r\ncontemplate the resignation of his crown, and who was now desirous of\r\nestablishing tranquillity in his states, thought fit, in the year 1554,\r\nto recall this too rigid governor to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the history of Mendoza’s life is not uniformly\r\nrelated by his biographers. According to some he retired to the\r\ncountry, devoted himself to poetry and philosophy, and appeared very\r\nseldom at the court of Philip II. Others assert that, though he no\r\nlonger retained his former influence, he continued a member of the\r\ncouncil of state under Philip II. and was present with that monarch at\r\nthe great battle of St. Quintin, fought in the year 1557. This much is\r\ncertain, that he was soon after engaged in an adventure at the court,\r\nwhich, for a man of his age and knowledge of the world, was of a very\r\nsingular nature. An altercation arose in the palace between him and a\r\ncourtier, who, according to Mendoza’s own declaration, was his rival in\r\nthe affections of a lady. This man, whose name is not mentioned, in a\r\nfit of violent exasperation, drew a dagger; upon which Mendoza seized\r\nhim, and threw him from a balcony into the street. What afterwards\r\nbecame of his antagonist is not recorded; but the transaction was the\r\nsubject of serious observation, and the grave Philip regarded it as\r\na high offence against the dignity of his person and his court. He\r\nwas, however, content to inflict a moderate punishment, and merely\r\ncondemned Mendoza to a short imprisonment. The old statesman occupied\r\nthe period of his imprisonment in the ancient Spanish style, namely,\r\nin composing lamentations on the unkindness of his mistress:[171] and\r\nthese romantic effusions do not appear to have been considered by his\r\ncontemporaries as absurd and ridiculous at his time of life. But the\r\nsorrows expressed in his amatory ditties did not drive the venerable\r\nlover to despair; for when he was soon after set at liberty, though\r\nstill exiled from court, he observed with the eye of a politician the\r\ninsurrection of the Moriscoes, or converted Arabs of Granada; and when\r\nthe insurrection broke out into a formal war, he noted down all the\r\nremarkable events, and afterwards detailed them in an historical work,\r\nwhich has obtained for him the name of the Spanish Sallust. He profited\r\nof this opportunity to collect a great number of Arabic manuscripts.\r\nObservations on the works of Aristotle, a translation of the Mechanics\r\nof that philosopher, and some political treatises, were, it appears,\r\nthe last of his literary labours. He was thus actively and usefully\r\nemployed until his death, which happened when he was upwards of\r\nseventy, at Valladolid, in the year 1575. He bequeathed his collection\r\nof books and manuscripts to the king, and it still forms one of the\r\nmost valuable portions of the library of the Escurial.[172]\r\n\r\nA detailed account of the life of this distinguished man, cannot\r\nbe regarded as a biographical excrescence in a history of Spanish\r\nLiterature; for in no other poet’s life and works is the real Castilian\r\nspirit of the age of Charles V. so clearly displayed as in those of\r\nDiego de Mendoza. The universality of his literary talent will be best\r\nunderstood, when it is known with what energy, precision, and facility\r\nhe accommodated himself to, and controuled the circumstances in which\r\nhe happened to be placed in all the practical relations of life.\r\nThat trait too in the portrait of his mind, which is most worthy of\r\nobservation, namely, the constancy with which, instead of abandoning\r\none species of mental activity for another, he continued throughout the\r\ndifferent periods of his life, from youth to extreme old age, always to\r\nunite in his person the poet, the man of letters, and the statesman,\r\ngives reason to expect that his works, however differing in kind, will\r\nbe found to possess a certain common character.\r\n\r\nDiego de Mendoza did more for the poetic literature of his country\r\nthan his countrymen seem to have acknowledged. Spanish writers, it\r\nis true, place him next in rank to Boscan and Garcilaso de la Vega,\r\namong the poets who introduced the Italian style into Castilian\r\npoetry. But they cannot pardon the harshness of his versification in\r\nthose poems in which he adopted the metrical forms of Italy. Rendered\r\nfastidious by the rhythmical harmony which a Castilian ear can never\r\ndispense with, the Spaniards have held in very trifling estimation the\r\nepistles of Mendoza; though those compositions, in a striking manner,\r\nextended the boundaries of Castilian poetry. As an epistolary poet,\r\nhe might justly be styled the Spanish Horace, if his tercets flowed\r\nas smoothly as the hexameters of the latin poet. Making allowance,\r\nhowever, for the want of that pure harmony and that didactic delicacy\r\nin which Horace is inimitable, Mendoza’s epistles may rank among the\r\nbest productions of the kind in modern literature. With the exception\r\nof Boscan and Garcilaso de la Vega, no Spanish poet had evinced any\r\ntraces of that horatian spirit with which this author was endowed. In\r\nthe collection of Mendoza’s poems, these epistles are merely called\r\n_cartas_ (letters.) Some of them are of a romantic cast, and overloaded\r\nwith tedious love complaints. But the rest, like Horace’s epistles,\r\nare didactic, full of agreeable but sound philosophy, precise and yet\r\nunconstrained in expression, and rescued from the monotonous effect\r\nof moral instruction, by a happy interchange of precepts, images, and\r\ncharacters. A masculine understanding, which clearly penetrates all\r\nsocial relations, and a noble spirit, which estimates the blessings\r\nof life according to their real value, diffuse over these epistles a\r\ncharm at once serene and attractive. Some of the most beautiful, for\r\nexample, that addressed to Boscan, which is best known, and which on\r\naccount of the answer is printed among Boscan’s poems, were composed\r\nin Italy during the more early part of the author’s life. But in\r\nestimating the poetical works of Mendoza, chronological arrangement\r\nis of little importance, for as a poet he preserved equality from the\r\ncommencement to the close of his career. His epistle to Boscan is\r\nin part an imitation of that of Horace to Numicius.[173] The latter\r\nhalf, however, belongs exclusively to Mendoza. In this portion of the\r\nepistle he presents to his friend the outline of the charming picture\r\nof domestic happiness, to which Boscan himself, in the answer already\r\nmentioned, has given a higher finish; and the taste which can overlook\r\nthe beauty of this picture on account of want of smoothness in the\r\nversification, must be depraved by the affectation of refinement.[174]\r\nAnother epistle, addressed to Don Luis de Zuñiga, contains an\r\ningenious and striking comparison of the character of two heterogeneous\r\nand equally foolish classes of men. The one wholly attached to the\r\nvulgar pleasures of the moment, and stupidly indifferent to the affairs\r\nof the world;[175] while the other, on the contrary, is cheated by\r\nrestless cares and anxieties out of the enjoyment of the present.[176]\r\nIn these epistles, Mendoza unfolded the result of his experience, as\r\nthe Infante Juan Manuel did a century and a half earlier, in his Count\r\nLucanor, though in a totally different manner. Mendoza’s style is that\r\nof an accomplished man of the world, formed in the school of the latin\r\npoets.\r\n\r\nMendoza’s sonnets possess neither the grace nor the harmony essential\r\nto that species of composition. They owe their existence to the amatory\r\nspirit of the age rather than to the poetic inspiration of the author.\r\nThough he composed in the Italian manner with less facility than\r\nBoscan and Garcilaso, he felt more correctly than they or any other\r\nof his countrymen, the difference between the Spanish and Italian\r\nlanguages, with respect to their capabilities for versification. The\r\nSpanish admits of none of those pleasing elisions, which, particularly\r\nwhen terminating vowels are omitted, render the mechanism of Italian\r\nversification so easy, and enable the poet to augment or diminish the\r\nnumber of syllables according to his pleasure; and this difference\r\nin the two languages renders the composition of a Spanish sonnet a\r\ndifficult task. Still more does the Spanish language seem hostile\r\nto the soft termination of a succession of feminine rhymes, for the\r\nSpanish poet, who adopts this rule of the Italian sonnet, is compelled\r\nto banish from his rhymes, all infinitives of verbs, together with\r\na whole host of sonorous substantives and adjectives.[177] Mendoza,\r\ntherefore, availed himself of the use of masculine rhymes in his\r\nsonnets; but this metrical license was strongly censured by all\r\npartizans of the Italian style. Nevertheless had he given to his\r\nsonnets more of the tenderness of Petrarch, it is probable that they\r\nwould have found imitators. Some of them, indeed, may be considered as\r\nsuccessful productions, and throughout all the language is correct and\r\nnoble.[178]\r\n\r\nMendoza’s canciones have nearly the same character as his sonnets,\r\nexcept that they more obviously mark the influence of the horatian\r\node on the lyric fancy of the author. The versification, which is\r\nsonorous, though deficient in harmony, is occasionally united with a\r\ndegree of obscurity from which the other productions of Mendoza are\r\ntotally exempt.[179] The least successful of his poems in the Italian\r\nstyle is a mythological tale in octave verse, founded on the history of\r\nAdonis, but along with which the author has interwoven the history of\r\nAtalanta. The story is, however, related in a very pleasing manner.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards give the preference, not to this first class of the\r\npoetic works of Mendoza, but to the second, which consists of lyric\r\npoems in the old national style, the origin of which it is, however,\r\neasy to perceive must be referred to a more highly cultivated age.\r\nThe similarity between these poems and others of the same sort in the\r\n_Romancero general_, clearly proves that many of the poets of the age\r\nof Charles V. had tacitly agreed to improve the old national poetry,\r\nwithout, like the impetuous Castillejo, (of whom further mention will\r\nsoon be made) waging open war against the reformers of the school of\r\nBoscan. Many of Mendoza’s lyric pieces are inserted in the _Romancero\r\ngeneral_ without the author’s name. In these compositions the syllabic\r\nmeasure seems to have been the chief object of improvement. But this\r\nimprovement, however successful, was at the same time necessarily\r\nlimited; and the beautiful forms of the Italian canzone possessed\r\ntoo striking a superiority over the most cultivated forms of rhyme\r\nin the old redondillas, to yield to the latter in any collision. All\r\nMendoza’s lyric compositions are in stanzas of four lines; and the\r\npieces of this description now obtained, by way of distinction, the\r\nname of redondillas, which seems originally to have been applied to all\r\ntrochaic verses in lines of four feet.[180] But songs in stanzas of\r\nfive lines, though in other respects similar to those just mentioned,\r\nare called in Mendoza’s collection _quintas_ or _quintillas_. The\r\ntrochaic stanza in four lines of three feet,[181] of which the\r\n_Romancero general_ also contains several specimens, was found to be\r\nmost suitable to _endechas_, or funeral songs, in the old national\r\nstyle, and to compositions of that class Mendoza applied it. He wrote\r\nmany romantic epistles in the redondilla stanza of four lines; and\r\ndid not neglect the other old lyric forms, such as the _Villancicos_,\r\n&c. The improvement of style, which is an essential feature of all\r\nthese poems, was limited by Mendoza to accuracy of expression, and to\r\nsoftening the quaintness of the old subtilties: to these, however,\r\nhe himself sometimes resorted; and he seems to have been of opinion,\r\nthat the character of this kind of poetry rendered their occasional\r\nintroduction indispensable. In compositions of a tender and melancholy\r\ncharacter,[182] he is less successful than in those of a comic\r\ncast.[183]\r\n\r\nConsidering Mendoza’s wit and knowledge of mankind, it may naturally\r\nbe presumed that his satyrical poems, which however exist only in\r\nmanuscript, mark a great advancement in this species of poetry in\r\nSpain. These poems are mentioned by all Mendoza’s biographers; one\r\nis called _La Pulga_ (the Flea,) another _La Caña_ (the Reed), and\r\na third bears the comical title of _Elogio de la Zanahoria_ (Eulogy\r\non the Parsnip.) None, however, have yet passed the ordeal of the\r\ninquisition. Their titles seem to indicate a kind of coarse humour in\r\nthe style of the burlesque satyres of the Italians.\r\n\r\nSome of Mendoza’s prose compositions have, however, obtained greater\r\ncelebrity than his poems; and they unquestionably form an epoch in the\r\nhistory of Spanish prose. The comic romance of _Lazarillo de Tormes_,\r\nwhich Mendoza wrote while he was a student at Salamanca, is either the\r\nvery first production of its kind, or at least the first that obtained\r\nany thing like literary consideration. Soon after its publication it\r\nwas translated into Italian, and subsequently into French, and by\r\nthe means of this French translation it has been read throughout all\r\nEurope. Relations of interesting tricks of roguery, probably formed at\r\na more early period a favourite amusement with the Spaniards; for that\r\nadroit feats of cunning and deception have had for them a charm of a\r\npeculiar kind, the whole history of their comic literature sufficiently\r\nproves. Mendoza, therefore, gave to his humorous fancy a direction\r\nconformable to the spirit of his country, when he chose, as the subject\r\nof his work, the Adventures of a Beggar Lad, who makes a kind of\r\nfortune by dint of cheating and roguery; and the comic interest of the\r\nproduction was enhanced by its contrast with the pompous romances of\r\nchivalry. In the perusal of such a tale, the Spanish reader willingly\r\ndescended from the romantic ideal world to the sphere of common life.\r\nThe skill with which Mendoza has sketched the vices of avarice and\r\nselfishness in the persons into whose service Lazarillo enters, is\r\nno less remarkable than the bold regard for truth which led him to\r\ninclude priests in the number of his odious characters. The inquisition\r\nof course could not expect that the Spaniards should regard the\r\necclesiastic profession as a security against every vice; and Lazarillo\r\nde Tormes sufficiently proves that in Mendoza’s time the priesthood\r\nwas not guaranteed against public satire in Spain. Under the reign of\r\nPhilip II. however, satires of this kind became subject to a certain\r\ndegree of restraint; and since that period Mendoza’s romance has only\r\nbeen suffered to escape because its free circulation was once permitted\r\nby the inquisition. No critic has hitherto called in question the truth\r\nand accuracy of the pictures of vulgar life in Lazarillo de Tormes;\r\nbut an author named de Luna, who styles himself an interpreter of the\r\nCastilian language, published a new edition of the romance with the\r\nview of correcting the diction. De Luna likewise added a second part\r\nto the story, for Mendoza in his maturer years never felt inclined to\r\nfinish the comic work which he had commenced in his youth.[184]\r\n\r\nA very different spirit animates the historical work in which Mendoza\r\ntraces the history of the rebellion of Granada.[185] Mendoza formed\r\nhis style, as a historian, principally on that of Sallust, and only\r\noccasionally imitated Tacitus for the sake of variety. Were it not that\r\nhe sometimes oversteps the bounds of true elegance and falls into an\r\noverstudied and artificial manner, this work might be ranked, without\r\nreserve, among the best historical models; and notwithstanding the\r\naffectation with which it is here and there disfigured,[186] it is,\r\nunquestionably, after the works of Machiavell and Guicciardini, the\r\nfirst production of modern literature that deserves to be compared with\r\nthe classic histories of antiquity.\r\n\r\nHowever carefully Mendoza polished the rhetorical form of his history,\r\nstill the importance of the materials and a true philosophic spirit\r\nare every where prominent throughout his representation of facts.\r\nBeing himself a native of Granada, his power of rightly viewing the\r\nevents, and the impression he received from them, must have been much\r\nthe same as if he had been an eye witness of all that passed. Besides,\r\nhe derived his information from the most authentic sources; for at the\r\nperiod in question he was residing on his estate in the vicinity of the\r\ntheatre of the war. His nephew, the Marquis de Mondejar, was for some\r\ntime commander in chief of the army against the rebels; and Mendoza\r\nhimself had long been so intimately connected with the government\r\nat Madrid, that no individual in Spain had better opportunities of\r\nobtaining that knowledge of the secret as well as of the ostensible\r\nsprings of transactions which is necessary for a just historical\r\nrepresentation of events. The atrocious measures adopted by Phillip\r\nII. to suppress the insurrection in Granada, were, however, no less\r\nopposed to the sound political views of Mendoza, than the fanatic\r\ncruelty and glaring injustice by which the unhappy Moriscos had been\r\ndriven into rebellion appear, however good a catholic he may have\r\nbeen, to have revolted his feelings. But neither his opinion nor his\r\ncompassion could be openly avowed. He therefore availed himself of all\r\nthe subtle windings of the historical art, to render his representation\r\nof events easily intelligible to those who thought as he did, and at\r\nthe same time to secure himself against any literal interpretation\r\nwhich spiritual or temporal despotism might have employed to his\r\ndisadvantage. Wherever undeniable facts, which the government according\r\nto its own maxims could not venture to conceal, clearly expose the\r\nfolly and inhumanity by which the Moors were reduced to despair,\r\nMendoza apparently refrains from pronouncing any judgment, while\r\nthe poignant manner in which he relates the facts, is in itself a\r\nsufficient condemnation.[187]\r\n\r\nWhen the fault rests rather with the agents of the government than\r\nwith the government itself, he seems to attack only the former.\r\nIn order that the just cause of the Moriscos might be, for once,\r\npowerfully vindicated, he puts, after the manner of the ancients, a\r\nspeech into the mouth of one of the chiefs of the conspirators.[188]\r\nThis is the only speech in the work which seems sufficient to shew\r\nthat at least it was not inserted from a spirit of servile imitation;\r\nbut he occasionally ventures, contrary to the practice of modern\r\nlanguages, to approximate his narrative style to that of the writers of\r\nantiquity; as for example, where he employs a succession of verbs in\r\nthe infinitive mood.[189] The Spaniards, however, seem to have regarded\r\nthe grammatical freedom used by Mendoza as perfectly conformable to the\r\ngenius of their language. During the gloomy and suspicious government\r\nof Philip II. this excellent work was only to be read in manuscript. It\r\nwas first published at Madrid, in the year 1610, five-and-thirty years\r\nafter the death of the author, and was reprinted at Lisbon in 1617;\r\nbut both editions were purposely mutilated.[190] The text was at last\r\ngiven complete in the edition of the work, which appeared in 1776.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAA DE MIRANDA.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the great reform of the Castilian poetry having\r\npenetrated into Portugal, a similar reform took place in the poetry\r\nof that nation. At this time the Castilian language was held in\r\nsuch high consideration in Portugal, that even Portuguese poets,\r\nwithout undervaluing their national tongue, thought themselves bound\r\noccasionally to write verses in Castilian, to entitle them to be\r\nregarded as perfect masters of the poetic art. In the first half of the\r\nsixteenth century, two of the most celebrated of these Portuguese poets\r\nlaboured with such success to extend the dominion of Castilian pastoral\r\npoetry, that the thread of the history of Spanish literature would be\r\nbroken, were a notice of the poetic merits of these two celebrated men\r\nconfined solely to the history of the literature of Portugal. One of\r\nthem, Francisco de Saa de Miranda, who was born in 1494, and died in\r\n1558, belongs, however, in so eminent a degree, to his own nation, and\r\nthe circumstances of his life are so closely connected with the history\r\nof Portuguese poetry, that it would be an injustice to Portuguese\r\nliterature to rank him exclusively among the poets of Spain. Besides,\r\nmost of his poetic works, with the exception of his pastoral poems,\r\nare written in the Portuguese language.[191] The other Portuguese\r\npoet, who claims attention in the history of Spanish poetry, is Jorge\r\nde Montemayor. He, through his residence in Spain, became wholly a\r\nSpaniard:--the work to which he chiefly owes his celebrity is written\r\nin Spanish; and he had so decided an influence on Spanish literature,\r\nthat this would be the proper place for introducing an account of\r\nhis short life and of his poetry, did not Saa de Miranda’s Castilian\r\npastorals, which are of older date, demand a previous notice.[192]\r\n\r\nThe bucolic effusions of Saa de Miranda exhibit in their general tone\r\nmore traits of resemblance to Theocritus, than are to be found in the\r\nwritings of Garcilaso de la Vega. Garcilaso’s pastoral style, with all\r\nits simplicity, was not sufficiently rural for Saa de Miranda. Like\r\nTheocritus his feelings seem to have dictated to him pure rural ideas;\r\nand he transferred this characteristic of his Portuguese eclogues\r\nto those which he wrote in Spanish, which are the most numerous.\r\nNevertheless, even in his rural poems he did not wish to renounce the\r\nattributes of the loftier style of poetry. He was, however, heedless of\r\nall critical distinction of the different kinds of poetry, and would,\r\nwithout scruple, commence a poem, in the metre of an Italian canzone,\r\nas an ode, proceed with it in epic metaphors,[193] and conclude it in\r\nthe simplest idyllic style. With equal indifference he chose sometimes\r\noctave verse, sometimes tercets for his pastoral poems, which thus\r\nalternately assume a lyric and a dramatic tone. This capricious\r\nmixture of poetic genera and styles deteriorates in no slight degree\r\nthe quality of Saa de Miranda’s poetry. The elevated tone of the ode\r\nforms a singular contrast when introduced in the same composition along\r\nwith the easy familiar style, which, in the opinion of Saa de Miranda,\r\nthe pure pastoral character of his poetry required. But no modern\r\npoet has succeeded so well in the union of simplicity and grace; and\r\nin this respect the eclogues of Saa de Miranda are unequalled. When\r\nhe describes the gambols of the nymphs, with whom his fancy animates\r\nhis native woodland scenes;[194]--when he sketches impetuous storms\r\nof passion, softened by the charm of his colouring, yet kept true to\r\nnature;[195]--when he introduces nymphs discoursing;[196]--or, when\r\nhe abandons himself to a tone of elegiac melancholy;[197]--one knows\r\nnot whether most to admire, the delicate truth and penetrating depth\r\nof his ideas, or the artless precision and facility of his expression.\r\nIn such cases he often abandons the natural style of Theocritus for\r\na more lofty or ideal manner. When, in some of his other eclogues,\r\nhis shepherds converse on their occupations or superstitions,[198]\r\nhe likewise departs from the prosaic nature of real pastoral life,\r\nsuch as he had the opportunity of observing in his native country,\r\nand gradually elevates it to romantic ideality. It happened, however,\r\nthat he occasionally found the prosaic truth of his pictures\r\nsufficiently interesting, and then to be truly natural he avoided all\r\nembellishment.[199]\r\n\r\nSome of Saa de Miranda’s popular songs, called _Cantigas_, a term which\r\nin Portuguese corresponds with _Villancicos_ in Spanish, are inimitable\r\nfor grace and simplicity.[200]\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTEMAYOR.\r\n\r\nThe poet who is celebrated in Spanish literature by the name of Jorge\r\nde Montemayor, was born in the year 1520, at Montemor, a little town\r\nof Portugal, not far from Coimbra. He took for his name that of his\r\nnative city, spelt and pronounced in the Spanish way, probably because\r\nhis own family name was not deemed sufficiently sonorous; and thus the\r\nlatter has been entirely lost. The talent of this young Portuguese\r\ndeveloped itself without the aid of a previous literary cultivation.\r\nAt an early period of life he served in the Portuguese army, and, as\r\nthere is reason to believe, in the rank of a common soldier. His taste\r\nfor music, and the reputation he had acquired as a singer, induced him\r\nto visit Spain, where the Infant Don Philip, afterwards Philip II.\r\nhad formed a company of court musicians, who were to accompany him\r\non his travels through Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands. Jorge de\r\nMontemayor, being admitted as a vocal member of this travelling musical\r\ncompany, gained an opportunity of seeing the world, and at the same\r\ntime making himself master of the Castilian language, which became to\r\nhim a second mother tongue. He was, however, attached to Spain by a\r\nstill closer link, namely, his love for a beautiful Castilian lady,\r\nwhom he occasionally introduces in his poems under the name of Marfida.\r\nThis Marfida became the deity of his poetry; and when, on his return\r\nto Spain, he found her wedded to another, he endeavoured to divert his\r\nsorrow by poetic effusions, in which he represented the faithless\r\nbeauty as a romantic shepherdess; and, uniting these with several\r\nof his other compositions, he formed the whole into a romance. This\r\nromance, which he entitled _Diana_, was received by the Spanish public\r\nwith a degree of favour never before extended to any Spanish book,\r\nAmadis de Gaul excepted; and it speedily found no fewer imitators than\r\nAmadis itself. The Queen of Portugal was desirous that the celebrated\r\nauthor of Diana should return to his native country. She recalled\r\nhim, and he obeyed the honourable mandate. No further particulars of\r\nhis history are known. He died by some violent means, either in 1561\r\nor 1562. He was upwards of forty at the period of his death, which,\r\naccording to some accounts, took place in Portugal, and according to\r\nothers in Italy.[201]\r\n\r\nThe Diana of Montemayor is one of the few romantic works which belong\r\nentirely to the soul of the inventor, which are embued throughout with\r\nindividual interest, and which on that very account exercise the more\r\ninfluence over unsophisticated minds, because the author possessed\r\nsufficient poetic genius successfully to convey the joys and sorrows\r\nof his own heart under the forms of a general interest. But this\r\nromance can never be to any other cultivated people what it was to the\r\nSpaniards of the sixteenth century. Still less can it be regarded as a\r\nclassical fragment, even though judged according to the lenient rules\r\nby which every fragment is estimated; unless, indeed, after the manner\r\nof some modern critics, new rules of art be deduced from defective\r\nexamples, for the sake of admiring as incomparable the grossest\r\nabsurdities, under the title of romantic complexity. But with all its\r\nfaults, this unfinished pastoral romance (for it was not brought to a\r\nconclusion by Montemayor) possesses a poetic merit, which entitles it\r\nto the esteem of all ages.\r\n\r\nThe design of the work, so far as Montemayor’s ideas render his\r\nintention obvious, sometimes charms by its graceful simplicity,\r\nand at others becomes grotesque, through an illegitimate romantic\r\ncombination of heterogeneous species of composition. The shepherd\r\nSireno, who represents the poet himself, on his return to his native\r\ncountry, visits the scene of the innocent joys which the inconstant\r\nshepherdess Diana once shared along with him. Overwhelmed with grief,\r\nhe draws out first a lock of hair belonging to his mistress; and then\r\none of her letters, which he reads. While he is thus communing with\r\nhimself, he is joined by another romantic adorer of the beautiful\r\nDiana. This shepherd, whose love had always been unrequited, now joins\r\nhis lamentations to those of the once happy Sireno, and each vies\r\nwith the other in claiming to himself the heaviest load of misery.\r\nThey are joined by a shepherdess, named Selvagia, who has been no\r\nless unfortunate in love than themselves. She relates her history\r\nvery circumstantially, and thus terminates the first book. In the\r\nsecond, the conversation of these lovers is continued, until three\r\nnymphs appear, one of whom relates Sireno’s history in a song of some\r\nlength. Up to the conclusion of this song, the pastoral simplicity of\r\nthe story is preserved uninterrupted by any incident approximating to\r\nthe terrible; but suddenly a party of savage robbers completely armed\r\nappears. The nymphs are about to fly, but are detained by the robbers.\r\nA battle then ensues between the robbers and the shepherds, the latter\r\nattacking the former with stones. The robbers are on the point of\r\novercoming their rustic antagonists, when a heroine, habited as a\r\nhuntress, rushes from a wood, and bending her bow, pierces the robbers\r\nwith her arrows, and liberates the nymphs. The fair huntress then joins\r\nthe party of nymphs and shepherds, and in her turn also relates her\r\nhistory. This narrative, together with the conversations and songs to\r\nwhich it gives rise, concludes the second book. In the third book the\r\nstory assumes the character of a fairy tale. The nymphs lead their\r\nprotectress, together with the rest of the party, through a thick\r\nforest to the castle of the wise Felicia, who is represented as a kind\r\nof priestess to the goddess Diana. The description of the wonders and\r\nmagnificence of the castle occupies a great portion of the third book.\r\nThe wise Felicia conducts the party to a superb hall of state, where\r\nthey behold a numerous collection of majestic statues, representing\r\nRoman emperors, Castilian knights, and Castilian ladies. Even a place\r\nis found for the statue of a Moorish knight, of whose conflicts with\r\nthe Christians a long history is related in this sanctuary of the\r\ngoddess Diana. By means of enchantment Felicia cures Sireno of the\r\ntorments of love. At length, in the sixth book, the poet releases\r\nhis shepherds and shepherdesses from Felicia’s palace, and the reader\r\nfor the first time becomes acquainted with the shepherdess Diana. She\r\nattaches the blame of her infidelity to her parents, by whom, during\r\nthe absence of Sireno, she was forced to give her hand to another. In\r\nthe following scenes, to the conclusion of the seventh book, where\r\nMontemayor’s labour terminates, the history of the principal characters\r\nmakes no further progress. Some of the other lovers in the romance are,\r\nhowever, united according to their wishes.\r\n\r\nThis composition, in which it is easy to recognize the uncultivated\r\ngenius of a poet, who, to give vent to the emotions of his soul, deemed\r\nit necessary to wander through the whole region of romance, can only\r\nbe regarded by the unprejudiced critic as a fantastical frame-work,\r\nserving to display pictures of the feelings and a philosophy of the\r\nheart, which constitute the prominent features of the whole poem.\r\nTo paint romantic fidelity under the most fascinating and various\r\nforms, and at the same time to exhibit in a poetic point of view the\r\ntheory of that fidelity, which even in a poem could only be verified\r\nby facts, was the idea which guided Montemayor’s inventive fancy, and\r\nthe execution of which bears the full impression of his genius. The\r\nversified portion of the romance is the soul of the whole composition.\r\nA series of lyric poems, partly in the Italian and partly in the old\r\nCastilian style, are introduced; but these compositions are strikingly\r\ndistinguished from the eclogues of Saa de Miranda by an epigrammatic\r\npoignancy, which frequently degenerates into antiquated subtlety.[202]\r\nBut this epigrammatic turn usually imparts a more pointed precision\r\nto the lyrical expression, and a degree of consistency to the whole\r\ncomposition, which in no way injures its pastoral simplicity;[203]\r\nand when judged according to the characteristic form of the popular\r\nsongs, called _Villancicos_, it by no means presents, to Spaniards\r\nin particular, the idea of too much refinement or incongruity with\r\nrustic nature.[204] In order to judge candidly of the pastoral truth\r\nof these compositions, it is necessary to have the Spanish romantic\r\nideas of nature present to the mind. Montemayor is inexhaustible in new\r\nturns and images for the expression of tenderness. In depth of feeling\r\nhe vies with Saa de Miranda; and, though his poetry is occasionally\r\ndeficient in rhythmical polish, it in general presents so exquisite\r\na union of the grace of language, with a happy concordance of ideas,\r\nthat the reader must soon become warmed by the spirit of the poet, even\r\nthough he should begin to peruse the work with indifference.[205]\r\n\r\nMontemayor’s style of romantic prose has been a model for all writers\r\nof pastoral romances in the Spanish language. How far he himself\r\nimitated the prose of Sanazzar, cannot easily be ascertained, as it is\r\nnot known whether or not Sanazzar’s Arcadia[206] was the prototype of\r\nhis Diana. Though it is certain that Montemayor carefully endeavoured\r\nto give precision and dignity of expression, and to impart harmony\r\nto every line of his composition, his language nevertheless appears\r\nneither laboured nor affected. His taste seems to have been in\r\nonly a few instances seduced by the influence of that ostentatious\r\nsolemnity, which distinguished the common chivalrous romances, written\r\nin imitation of Amadis de Gaul. In general he remained faithful to\r\nthe dignified simplicity, which the author of the Amadis appears to\r\nhave regarded as the genuine characteristic of the lofty style of\r\nromantic prose. To this style his protracted but rhythmically pleasing\r\nsentences may justly be said to belong.[207] It is but seldom that a\r\nlow expression escapes him.[208] His descriptions are never deficient\r\nin vividness and force.[209] It is only in the didactic passages in\r\nwhich he propounds his philosophy of love, that his language becomes\r\ntinged with the scholastic formality, which at the period in which he\r\nwrote, was considered indispensable when any scholastic ideas were\r\nto be expressed; for though Montemayor had not received that kind of\r\neducation, which in his age was considered learned, he had picked up\r\nsome notions of the scholastic philosophy, which, when they interested\r\nhim, he was fond of introducing into the romance of his heart.[210]\r\n\r\nThe other works of Montemayor, which are not so celebrated as his\r\nDiana, are to be found in a collection of his poems, which, according\r\nto the old custom, is entitled a _Cancionero_.[211]\r\n\r\n\r\nHERRERA.\r\n\r\nFernando de Herrera, a poet very different in character from\r\nMontemayor, must next be included among the authors who chiefly\r\ncontributed to reform Castilian poetry, during the first half of the\r\nsixteenth century. Of the history of his life but little is known. He\r\nwas a native of Seville, and was born, according to the conjectures\r\nof his Spanish biographers, about the commencement of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Thus he flourished at the same time as Diego de Mendoza, and\r\nafforded another instance of the light of poetical improvement being\r\ndirected from the south of Spain. It appears that he did not enter\r\ninto the ecclesiastical state, to which he finally devoted himself,\r\nuntil he attained a mature age; but he must have received a literary\r\neducation, as he possessed no ordinary knowledge of the ancient and\r\nmodern languages, geography, mathematics, and scholastic philosophy.\r\nAccording to a portrait which has been preserved of him, he appears to\r\nhave been a handsome man; and some of the editors of his works alledge\r\nthat the lady whom he has celebrated in his verses under various names,\r\nwas not merely an ideal object of the poet’s tenderness. The admirers\r\nof his poetry have applied to him, after the Italian manner, the\r\nsurname of the _divine_; and this epithet, rendered so equivocal by its\r\napplication to Pietro Aretino, was never bestowed on any other Spanish\r\npoet. These few particulars are all that are known relative to the life\r\nof Fernando de Herrera. He died at an advanced age, probably soon after\r\nthe year 1578.[212]\r\n\r\nWhy Herrera should have obtained the title of divine, in preference\r\nto all the other poets of his nation, would appear almost\r\nincomprehensible, were it not known that two opposite parties vied with\r\neach other in exalting him; and, to avoid the appearance of yielding\r\non either side, considered themselves reciprocally bound to pronounce\r\ncompositions sublime which neither could regard as natural. Herrera\r\nwas, notwithstanding, a poet of powerful talent, and one who evinced\r\nundaunted resolution in pursuing the new path which he had struck out\r\nfor himself. The novel style, however, which he wished to introduce\r\ninto Spanish poetry, was not the result of a spontaneous essay, flowing\r\nfrom immediate inspiration, but was theoretically constructed on\r\nartificial principles. Thus, amidst traits of real beauty, his poetry\r\nevery where presents marks of affectation. The great fault of his\r\nlanguage is too much singularity; and his expression, where it ought to\r\nbe elevated, is merely far-fetched.\r\n\r\nHerrera fancied he had discovered that the diction of the Spanish\r\npoets, even in their best works, was too common, too nearly allied\r\nto the language of prose, and consequently very far removed from the\r\nclassical dignity which distinguishes the Greek and Roman poetry. This\r\nopinion induced him to form for himself a new style. He classed words\r\naccording to his fancy, into elegant and inelegant, and was careful\r\nto employ in his verse only those to which he attributed the former\r\ncharacter. He connected words, under significations which they do not\r\nbear in common language; and in contradistinction to the spirit of\r\nprose, he regarded certain repetitions, for example, the conjunction\r\n_and_ as very appropriate to poetry. He also introduced into his verse,\r\na free arrangement of words, after the model of the latin construction.\r\nFinally, he thought he could enrich the language of poetry by new\r\nwords, which he formed by analogy from existing Castilian words, or\r\nadopted immediately from the latin.[213] This peculiarity of style\r\nwas regarded as the perfection of poetry, by the party who idolized\r\nFernando de Herrera.[214]\r\n\r\nThose, however, who have no inclination to confound pompous with\r\npoetic language, or diction with the essence of poetry, must still\r\nallow to Herrera the possession of poetic ideas and precision of\r\nmanner, as well as a true dignity of expression, and an elegant\r\nharmony of versification. His language is not always affected, and his\r\nthoughts and descriptions, though frequently overstrained, are never\r\ntrivial.[215] Notwithstanding all the faults of his style, he must be\r\naccounted the first classical ode writer in modern literature, for\r\nthe attempts of the Italian poet Chiabrera to emulate Pindar, are of\r\nmore recent date; and here it is worthy of remark, that the Spanish\r\nodes of Herrera and the Italian odes of Chiabrera resemble each other\r\nin a mixture of the style of the Pindaric ode, with the style of the\r\ncanzone. Through the medium of that lyric form only, was the spirit of\r\nPindar felt by these imitators; and both were the more easily deceived,\r\nas the genius of the Spanish and Italian languages has a relation to\r\nthe metrical structure of the canzone, somewhat similar to that which\r\nthe genius of the Greek language bears to Pindaric verse. But the rapid\r\nand bold succession of thoughts and images, which animates the odes\r\nof Pindar, could not be imitated by poets, who, even in their boldest\r\nflights of fancy were bound down by the laws of the Italian canzone, to\r\nthe luxurious harmony of its protracted verbose periods. Thus Herrera’s\r\nodes, like those of Chiabrera, bear only a remote resemblance to\r\ntheir prototypes. Odes, however, they must be termed, though Herrera\r\nhimself has classed them, under the general title of _canciones_, along\r\nwith imitations of the Italian style, purely romantic, but versified\r\naccording to similar rules. In his celebrated odes on the battle of\r\nLepanto, in which the Spaniards under Don John of Austria, the natural\r\nson of Charles V. obtained a brilliant victory over the Turks, the\r\nmagnificence of the rhythm would be sufficiently attractive, though\r\nthe ideas conveyed in the torrent of sonorous syllables possessed less\r\npoetic beauty than really belong to them.[216] Occasionally, however,\r\nHerrera’s ideas degenerate into fantastical hyperboles; for instance,\r\nwhen boasting of his hero, he says, that Don John of Austria, that\r\nglorious conqueror of the infidels and the elements, combines within\r\nhimself “whatever of heavenly power animates terrestrial bodies;” and\r\nthat therefore “the fixed earth, the extended waters, the circumambent\r\nair, and the ever glowing flames depend on him, so that through the\r\nsecret control which he exercises over earth, water, air, and fire, all\r\nthese elements are his works.”[217] But passages of real beauty occur\r\nin Herrera’s odes, which afford a sufficient compensation for this sort\r\nof bombast.[218] Among the odes for which Herrera has chosen a softer\r\ntheme, the prize of superiority has been justly awarded to the Ode to\r\nSleep. It is one of those compositions which may be said to be single\r\nin their kind. The graceful choice of language, the picturesque effect,\r\nthe delicate keeping in the composition, and the finish given to all\r\nthe details in strict conformity with the true spirit of the theme,\r\nimpart to this ode or cancion a lyric beauty which must render it in\r\nall ages an object of admiration, not only to the lover, but to the\r\ncritic of poetry.[219]\r\n\r\nThe other poems of Herrera, though extremely numerous, require only\r\na slight notice.[220] His best sonnets, which are among the happiest\r\nimitations of Petrarch in the Spanish language, are characterized\r\nby the recurrence of some of the author’s favourite images, as for\r\nexample, the comparison of his mistress to light, or the evening\r\nstar,[221] &c. He is frequently very successful in the management of\r\nthese similes; but at other times he falls into strange absurdities,\r\nsuch as making the “curling waves of gold of his sweet light float\r\nin the wind.”[222] But extravagant tropes of this kind could not be\r\nvery offensive to Spanish taste, which had been accustomed to indulge\r\nthe orientalisms of the old national style, and they were indeed not\r\nonly tolerated but esteemed. It might have been expected that a writer\r\npossessing so much critical judgment as Herrera, would, as an imitator\r\nof Petrarch, have endeavoured to naturalize in his native tongue, the\r\nsimplicity of the Italian poet; but he was too much a Spaniard to be\r\npleased with such simplicity. His elegies, and other lyric compositions\r\nin the Italian syllabic measure, have all the same character.\r\n\r\nHerrera endeavoured, by other means than poetical composition, to give\r\nto the national taste of the Spaniards a direction conformable to\r\nhis own principles. He wrote a “Critical Commentary on the Poems of\r\nGarcilaso de la Vega.”[223] This commentary has served as a model for\r\nmany similar works, which have been the means of circulating various\r\nkinds of useful knowledge without having contributed in any remarkable\r\ndegree to the advancement of taste. Herrera, as a theorist, failed\r\nto establish any fixed point or station from which he might have\r\ntaken a clear and consistent view of the whole region of poetry. His\r\ncriticism everlastingly turns on detached ideas and words; and whenever\r\nopportunities for displaying his learning occur, he digresses into all\r\nthe regions of philosophy and literature. Of the indistinctness of his\r\nnotions, relative to the different species of poetry, some idea may\r\nbe formed from his definition of the elegy. He says--“an elegy should\r\nbe simple, soft, tender, amiable, terse, clear, and if it may be so\r\ncalled, noble; affecting to the feelings, and moving them in every way;\r\nneither very inflated nor very humble, nor obscured by affected phrases\r\nor far-fetched fables.”[224]\r\n\r\n\r\nLUIS DE LEON.\r\n\r\nLuis Ponce de Leon, the next lyric poet to be noticed, pursued a course\r\nvery different from that of Herrera, whose contemporary he was. He\r\nis usually called, by abbreviation, merely Luis de Leon, and did not\r\nobtain the surname of divine, to which, however, he might have laid\r\nclaim with infinitely more justice than Herrera, if his pious humility\r\nwould have permitted him to entertain the idea of maintaining any\r\ncompetition for earthly honours.[225]\r\n\r\nThis poet, who for classical purity of style and moral dignity of\r\nideas, had never been surpassed in Spanish literature, was, like\r\nHerrera and Mendoza, a native of the south of Spain. He was born at\r\nGranada, in the year 1527, where the family of the Ponces de Leon,\r\nwhich was connected with the most distinguished of the Spanish\r\nnobility, flourished. At an early period of life, Luis de Leon felt\r\na poetic inspiration, and cherished a love of retirement, which\r\nrendered him indifferent to outward show, and all the pleasures of\r\nthe great world. He found only in poetry and in the contemplation\r\nof a superior existence that food for which his soul longed. His\r\ntranquil and gentle mind exhibited none of the gloomy features of\r\nmonkish fanaticism, but was devoted to moral and religious meditation.\r\nAs soon as he had finished his scholastic studies, he entered, of his\r\nown free choice, into the ecclesiastical state. He was sixteen years\r\nof age when he made his profession in the order of St. Augustine\r\nat Salamanca. Theology now became his proper occupation. In Spain,\r\nespecially at that period, a man of the character of Luis de Leon, even\r\nif he possessed a mind capable of divesting itself of prejudice, could\r\nscarcely be expected to doubt the dogmas of the catholic faith; but his\r\npoetic imagination, which was not to be satisfied with their dry and\r\nscholastic interpretation, irresistibly impelled him to adorn them.\r\nLuis transferred the mild enthusiasm of his pious feelings into the\r\ntheological studies, to which his vocation devoted him. On religious\r\nsubjects he was a learned and diligent author; but his heart found, at\r\nleast during the first years of his monastic life, only in poetry, the\r\nfaithful interpreter of his love for that pure truth, to the attainment\r\nof which all his arduous efforts were directed. Though invested in\r\nhis thirty-third year with the dignity of doctor of theology, he\r\nmaintained, even within the cloister, his intimacy with the classic\r\nwriters of antiquity. The Hebrew poetry also worked powerfully on his\r\nimagination; and on one occasion he nearly fell a martyr to an attempt\r\nto translate and comment on the Song of Solomon. He was very far from\r\nwishing to give a too liberal interpretation of the amatory language\r\nof the original. He explained the sacred poem in perfect accordance\r\nwith the sense attributed to it by the church. But the inquisition\r\nhad, at that time, strictly prohibited the translation of any part of\r\nthe bible into the vulgar tongue. Luis de Leon, therefore, ventured\r\nto communicate his version in confidence to one friend only; but that\r\nfriend was not faithful to his trust, and the translation found its\r\nway into the hands of several individuals. It was soon denounced to\r\nthe inquisition, and the author was immediately thrown into prison by\r\nthat terrible tribunal. He himself mentions, in one of his letters,\r\nthat for the space of five years he was deprived of all communication\r\nwith mankind, and was not even permitted to see the light of day.[226]\r\nConscious of his innocence, he enjoyed during his captivity, according\r\nto his own testimony, a tranquillity and satisfaction of mind which he\r\nnever afterwards so fully experienced, when restored to freedom, and\r\nthe society of his friends.[227] At length justice was done to him,\r\nhe returned in triumph to his monastery, and was reinstated in his\r\necclesiastical dignities. From that period, he appears to have been\r\nwholly devoted to the duties of his order and the study of theology. He\r\ndied in 1591, in the sixty-fourth year of his age, being at that time\r\ngeneral and provincial vicar of Salamanca.\r\n\r\nThe poems of this amiable enthusiast are, according to his own\r\ntestimony,[228] for the most part the productions of his youth; but no\r\nother Spanish poet has succeeded in expressing the intense feelings\r\nof the heart under the control of so sound a judgment. It is only by\r\nreference to the pious tranquillity of a cultivated mind wrapt up in\r\nself communion, that the extraordinary correctness of this author’s\r\nstyle can be explained, for Luis de Leon is, without exception, the\r\nmost correct of all the Spanish poets, though he constantly regarded\r\nthe metrical clothing of his ideas as a very secondary object. To\r\nuse his own language, he wrote poetry rather in fulfilment of his\r\ndestiny, than purposely and by dint of study. At an early age he\r\nbecame intimately acquainted with the odes of Horace, and the elegance\r\nand purity of style which distinguish those compositions made a deep\r\nimpression on his imagination. Classical simplicity and dignity were\r\nthe models constantly present to his creative fancy. He, however,\r\nappropriated to himself the character of Horace’s poetry, too naturally\r\never to incur the danger of servile imitation. He discarded the prolix\r\nstyle of the canzone, and imitated the brevity of the strophes of\r\nHorace, in romantic syllabic measures and rhymes. More just feeling for\r\nthe imitation of the ancients was never evinced by any modern poet. His\r\nodes have, however, a character totally different from those of Horace,\r\nthough the sententious air which marks the style of both authors,\r\nimparts to them a deceptive resemblance. The religious austerity of\r\nLuis de Leon’s life was not to be reconciled with the epicurism of\r\nthe latin poet; but, notwithstanding this very different disposition\r\nof the mind, it is not surprising that they should have adopted the\r\nsame form of poetic expression, for each possessed a fine imagination,\r\nsubordinate to the control of a sound understanding. Which of the two\r\nis the superior poet, in the most extended sense of the word, it would\r\nbe difficult to determine, as each formed his style by free imitation,\r\nand neither overstepped the boundaries of a certain sphere of practical\r\nobservation. Horace’s odes exhibit a superior style of art, and from\r\nthe relationship between the thoughts and images, possess a degree of\r\nattraction which is wanting in those of Luis de Leon; but on the other\r\nhand, the latter are the more rich in that natural kind of poetry,\r\nwhich may be regarded as the overflowing of a pure soul, elevated to\r\nthe loftiest regions of moral and religious idealism.[229]\r\n\r\nLuis de Leon himself published a collection of his poetic works,\r\ndivided into three books. The first, contains his original poems--the\r\nsecond, translations from some of the ancient classics--and the third,\r\nmetrical versions of several of the psalms, and some parts of the book\r\nof Job.\r\n\r\nThe reader who peruses the poems of Luis de Leon, which are all odes,\r\nin the spirit in which the author wrote them, will fancy himself\r\ntransported to a better world. No furious zeal disturbs the gentle\r\npiety that pervades them; no extravagant metaphor destroys the harmony\r\nof the ideas and expression; and no discordant accent breaks the\r\npleasing melody of the rhythm. The idea of the perishableness of all\r\nearthly things,[230] is united with smiling pictures of nature.[231]\r\nThe imitations of Horace are only introduced to aid the poetic light\r\nin which the poet views those objects which were peculiarly interesting\r\nto his contemporaries.[232] One of Luis de Leon’s most celebrated odes\r\nis the _Noche Serena_, but the concluding stanzas do not correspond\r\nwith the beauty of the commencement.[233] In the ode to Felipe Ruiz,\r\nthe ardent aspiration for heavenly truth is very picturesquely\r\nexpressed.[234] But the exalted inspiration and tender enthusiasm in\r\nwhich Luis de Leon so widely departs from Horace, are most prominently\r\nevinced in his ode on Heavenly Life (_De la Vida del Cielo_). Here\r\nhis fancy is bold without launching into extravagant metaphors. What\r\nan etherial effulgence glows through his lyric picture of “the soft\r\nbright region, the meadow of holiness, never blighted by frost, nor\r\nwithered by the sun’s rays;--where the good shepherd, his head crowned\r\nwith blossoms of purple and white, without either sling or staff,\r\nleads his beloved flock to the sweet pasture covered with everblooming\r\nroses;--where the shepherd, reclining in the shade at noon, blows his\r\nheavenly pipe, whose feeblest tone, should it descend on the ear of the\r\npoet, would transform his whole soul to love.”[235] The ode in which\r\nthe genius of the Tagus prophecies to King Roderick the misfortunes of\r\nSpain, is more in Horace’s style, and possesses a very happy uniformity\r\nof character. In some other imitations of a similar kind, the fancy of\r\nthe pious poet willingly descends from the heavenly regions. The poems\r\ncontained in the first part of the collection are few in number. Those\r\nwhich Luis de Leon himself inserted, amount only to twenty-seven, and\r\namong them is an indifferent elegy, and a cancion in the Italian style\r\nof not much greater merit. Several other compositions, which he seems\r\nto have rejected, have been recently printed from manuscripts.[236]\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the poetic works of Luis de Leon consists of\r\ntranslations; but these translations form an epoch in the department\r\nof literature to which they belong. Those in the second book of the\r\ncollection are the first classical specimens, in modern literature, of\r\nthe art of renewing the ancient poetry in modern forms. Luis de Leon\r\nhas himself explained the principles by which he was guided in bringing\r\nthe ancient poetry within the sphere of the romantic. He endeavoured to\r\nmake the ancient poets speak, “as they would have expressed themselves,\r\nhad they been born in his own age in Castile, and had they written in\r\nCastilian.”[237] However bold this attempt may appear, and whatever\r\ndefects a translation of this kind may present to the eye of the\r\nconnoisseur who wishes for a faithful resemblance of the original,\r\nand not a flowery imitation, yet if the validity of the principle be\r\nonce admitted, Luis de Leon will be found to have fulfilled all that\r\nthe most rigid critic can desire. Besides, it must be considered that\r\ntranslations of a more literal character would scarcely have found\r\nreaders in Spain at that period. Luis de Leon translated Virgil’s\r\neclogues, partly in tercets, and partly in coplas;[238] a considerable\r\nseries of Horace’s odes in the same romantic syllabic measure which\r\nhe chose for his own odes;[239]--and a portion of Virgil’s georgics\r\nin stanzas. But the easy flowing style of his Spanish version of\r\nPindar’s first ode, excels all the rest.[240] To these translations\r\nare also added two imitations of Italian sonnets, which prove that\r\nhe succeeded very well in that species of composition, though among\r\nhis own original poems there is not a single sonnet. He translated the\r\npsalms of David, according to the rule he had prescribed to himself.\r\nHis translations speedily obtained the rank in Spanish literature\r\nto which they were entitled; and they have served as models for all\r\nsucceeding versions of Greek and Latin poetry in the Spanish language.\r\nLuis de Leon may indeed be blamed for having thwarted, by the style of\r\ntranslation which he introduced, all the attempts made to form Spanish\r\npoetry on the model of that of the ancients. But on the other hand, to\r\nhis example the Spaniards are indebted for numerous translations of\r\nGreek and Latin poetry, which have all the air of Spanish originals.\r\n\r\nIf Luis de Leon had not confined his prose writings exclusively to\r\nspiritual subjects, he would doubtless have also exercised a very\r\ndecided influence on the rhetorical cultivation of Spain. His sermons\r\n(_oraciones_) are, however, invariably mentioned in terms of praise by\r\nSpanish writers, whenever they allude to the theological literature of\r\ntheir country.[241] Among his other works intended for edification, The\r\nWoman as she should be, or The Perfect Wife, (_La Perfecta Casada_),\r\nwill perhaps be found the most interesting to the untheological class\r\nof readers; though it constantly turns on the positive morality of\r\nCatholicism, and therefore, like every mixed treatise of theology and\r\nmorals, is no legitimate specimen of the developement of ideas in the\r\ndidactic style.[242]\r\n\r\nLuis de Leon terminates the series of distinguished Spanish authors,\r\nwho during the first half of the sixteenth century, composed after the\r\nmodel of the great poets of Italy, or the ancient classics, and who,\r\nby the superiority of their genius, mainly contributed to give a new\r\ncharacter to Spanish poetry. There are, however others, whose poetic\r\nworks ought not to be passed over in silence; but to follow the example\r\nof those writers, who have hitherto related the history of Spanish\r\npoetry, without separating subordinate from eminent talent, would be to\r\nprolong an act of injustice. At the same time to the continuation which\r\nmust be made of the history of the lyric and pastoral poetry of Spain,\r\nduring the first half of the sixteenth century, may be very properly\r\nadded some account of a few unsuccessful efforts in epic composition,\r\nand a notice of the further progress of the old national poetry during\r\nthe same period.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MINOR SPANISH POETS DURING THE PERIOD OF THIS SECTION, VIZ.\r\n    ACUÑA--CETINA--PADILLA--GIL POLO.\r\n\r\nFernando de Acuña, one of the first of the distinguished men who became\r\nthe disciples of Boscan and Garcilaso, was of Portuguese extraction,\r\nbut born in Madrid, probably about the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury.[243] He signalized himself in the campaigns of Charles V.\r\nand was also a person of consideration at the court of that monarch.\r\nHe lived on terms of intimate friendship with Garcilaso de la Vega,\r\nwhom he survived for a considerable period, for it appears that his\r\ndeath did not take place until the year 1580. He proved his taste for\r\nclassical literature by translations and imitations. He paraphrased\r\nin iambic blank verse, several passages from Ovid’s Metamorphoses,\r\nand among the rest, the dispute between Ajax and Ulysses for the arms\r\nof Achilles, in very correct and harmonious language. He likewise\r\ntranslated some of the Heroides of the same author in tercets. In his\r\nown sonnets, cancions, and elegies, which are replete with sentiment\r\nand grace, it is easy to recognise a poet who successfully laboured\r\nto attain classical elegance of style.[244] He was also one of the\r\nfirst poets, who, by composing in short strophes, endeavoured to form\r\nan intermediate style between the Italian canzone and the Spanish\r\ncancion.[245]\r\n\r\nGutierre de Cetina is less known, though there is no doubt of his\r\nhaving lived about the same period, as he is mentioned by Herrera\r\nin his Commentary on the Works of Garcilaso. He was, like Herrera,\r\na native of Seville; and having removed to Madrid, was there\r\ninvested with an ecclesiastical dignity. Few of his poems have been\r\nprinted;[246] but from those few it is obvious that he had a fair\r\nchance of becoming the Anacreon of Spain. That glory, however, was\r\nreserved for Villegas. Still Gutierre de Cetina’s imitations of the\r\nanacreontic style are not without their share of sweetness and grace;\r\nand they are moreover remarkable as being the first productions in the\r\nclass to which they belong.[247] His madrigals also seem to have had no\r\nprototype in Spanish literature.[248] In his canciones, however, the\r\nromantic enthusiasm occasionally degenerates into absurdity.[249]\r\n\r\nPedro do Padilla, a knight of the spiritual order of St. Jago, must\r\nbe ranked in the same class with Gutierre. He vied with Garcilaso in\r\npastoral poetry; and in order to conciliate the partizans of both the\r\nold and the new styles, he introduced alternately in the same eclogue\r\nthe Italian and the ancient Spanish metres.[250] His poetry is still\r\nesteemed in Spain. He followed the old national custom by making the\r\nevents connected with the war in the Netherlands serve as subjects for\r\nromances.[251]\r\n\r\nBut a poet still more celebrated, and in a great degree indebted for\r\nhis fame to the immoderate encomium bestowed upon him by the pen of\r\nCervantes, is Gaspar Gil Polo, a native of Valencia, who continued\r\nand concluded Montemayor’s Diana under the title of _La Diana\r\nenamorada_.[252] A continuation of this pastoral romance had previously\r\nbeen undertaken by a writer named Perez; but without success. Gil\r\nPolo in one respect effected more than did Montemayor himself; but in\r\npoint of invention he is inferior, notwithstanding the faults of the\r\noriginal plan. After Sireno has been cured of his love by the sage\r\nFelicia, Gil Polo makes the passion of Diana revive, and renders her\r\nmore unhappy for Sireno’s sake, than he had previously been for hers.\r\nThus the romantic story is reversed; but the new relations under which\r\nit now appears are few. In the sequel the aid of the sage Felicia is\r\nagain obtained, and she finally unites the long separated lovers.\r\nThe narrative style in the prose portion of the romance presents a\r\nvery correct imitation of Montemayor; but neither the merit of this\r\nimitation, nor the continuation of the metaphysical reflections on\r\nlove, with which the romance is interspersed, would have gained for Gil\r\nPolo the approbation of the critic. What must have raised him higher\r\nthan Montemayor in the estimation of such a judge as Cervantes, is\r\nthe precision and clearness of the ideas, and the perfect polish of\r\nstyle in the poetic part of the romance. Montemayor has often indulged\r\nin too subtle or sophistical plays of wit. Gil Polo in painting the\r\nfeelings has exercised a sounder judgment, without, however, descending\r\nto the coldness of prose. His sonnets may be regarded as models;\r\nfor he has succeeded in combining the unity of ideas, which ought\r\nto distinguish that species of composition, with the most elegant\r\nrounding and regularity of structure.[253] In his canciones he has\r\noccasionally, for the sake of variety, imitated the Provençal rhymes\r\n(_rimas Provenzales_) with such happy dexterity, that the reader might\r\nfancy himself perusing some of the best opera songs, though no such\r\nthing as an opera then existed.[254] In like manner, he endeavoured to\r\nnaturalize the metrical structure of French verse (_rimas Franceses_)\r\nin the Spanish language, upon which the burthen of alexandrines\r\nhad already been inflicted.[255] In compliment to the old Spanish\r\ntaste, he bedecked his romance with a profusion of versified riddles\r\n(_preguntas_,) which are, for the most part, so exceedingly dull, that\r\nit is difficult to conceive how they could be endured by a man of Gil\r\nPolo’s talent.[256] In honour of Valencia, his native city, he composed\r\na poem, in which the genius of the little river Turia is made to sing\r\nthe praises of the celebrated men to whom Valencia had given birth.\r\nThis song of Turia (_Canto de Turia_) has found patriotic commentators,\r\nwithout whose laborious explanations it would have been unintelligible\r\nto foreign readers.[257]\r\n\r\n\r\n    OBSTACLES TO THE IMITATION OF THE ROMANTIC EPOPEE IN\r\n    SPAIN--UNSUCCESSFUL ESSAYS IN SERIOUS EPOPEE--TRANSLATIONS OF\r\n    CLASSICAL EPIC POETRY.\r\n\r\nThough Spanish literature was in the manner just recorded, enriched\r\nduring half a century by numerous lyric and pastoral compositions,\r\nwhich deserve to be handed down with honour to posterity, yet within\r\nthe same interval epic poetry made but little advancement in Spain.\r\n\r\nEarly in this period the absurd name of idyls (_idyllios_) appears\r\nto have been applied to such narrative poems as were not romances,\r\nand to have marked out a particular field for a kind of poetic tales,\r\nwhich were in some measure imitations from the ancients, and yet\r\nwere executed in the romantic style. Such, for example, was Boscan’s\r\nfree translation of the story of Hero and Leander from Musæus, which\r\nthe Spaniards call their first idyl. Thus the term idyls in Spanish,\r\nconveys no idea of pastoral poems, which are always called eclogues\r\n(_eglogas_.)[258] Castillejo, of whom further mention will shortly\r\nbe made, imitated in old Castilian verse, stories from Ovid, and\r\ngave to them the name of idyls. The spurious heroic style which the\r\nauthors of these tales introduced, proved, without doubt, one of the\r\nobstacles to the cultivation of chivalrous epic poetry in Spain; but\r\nit is also to be recollected, that the luxuriant mixture of the comic\r\nwith the serious, which is the very soul of the romantic epopee of the\r\nItalians, was by no means congenial to Spanish taste. In Spain the\r\nworks of Boyardo and Ariosto were known only through the medium of bad\r\ntranslations, and were read merely with the interest attached to all\r\nbooks of chivalry. Finally, the spirit of the old romance poetry was\r\nalso hostile to the chivalric epopee. To descend from the cordial\r\ngravity of the national narrative romances, to the careless levity with\r\nwhich the venerable heroes of chivalry were treated by the Italian\r\nwriters, was a transition repugnant to the patriotic feelings of the\r\nSpaniards; who, in their wars with the Italians, were the more disposed\r\nto be proud of the preservation of their national spirit of chivalry,\r\nwhen they found that it facilitated their victories over men who were\r\nbetter fitted for intrigue than for defending their freedom sword in\r\nhand. Thus, to the chivalrous epopee of the Italians, the Spaniards\r\nremained as completely strangers, as if they had been excluded from all\r\nopportunity of becoming acquainted with that kind of composition; and\r\nyet the period when the Spaniards and Italians maintained the closest\r\npolitical and literary relations, precisely corresponds with that\r\nof Ariosto’s first celebrity, and of the numerous imitations of the\r\n_Orlando Furioso_, which appeared in the Italian language.[259]\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, several Spanish poets, during the first half of the\r\nsixteenth century, zealously competed for the palm in the serious\r\nepopee; but obstacles again arose, which all the force of Spanish\r\ngenius was not sufficient to surmount. Torquato Tasso had not yet shewn\r\nwhat the serious epic was capable of becoming, and what it must be, in\r\norder to be reconciled to the taste of modern times. The Spaniards were\r\nso little prepared for the new poetry with which they had suddenly been\r\nmade acquainted on the first imitation of the Italian style, that they\r\ncould not be expected to enter without a guide into the true spirit\r\nof the modern epopee. The men, who at this time boldly attempted to\r\nbecome the Homers of their country, appear to have felt that they could\r\nnot select from ancient history the materials for an epic poem. But on\r\nthe other hand, their patriotic feelings prepossessed them too much in\r\nfavour of events of recent occurrence. The age in which they themselves\r\nlived was, in their eyes, the most illustrious and the most worthy of\r\nepic glory; a Spanish Homer could record no achievements save those\r\nof the Spaniards under Charles V.; and the hero, who in their poems\r\neclipsed all others, was their favourite Charles, the never conquered,\r\n(_el nunca vencido_,) as he was styled by all the Spanish writers of\r\nthe sixteenth century. Thus arose the _Caroliads_, or heroic poems,\r\nin praise of Charles V. all of which speedily sunk into oblivion.\r\nAmong them were the _Carlos Famoso_, by Luis de Zapata; the _Carlos\r\nVictorioso_, by Geronymo de Urrea; _La Carolea_, by the Valencian poet,\r\nGeronymo Sampèr, &c. Alonzo Lopez, surnamed Pinciano, who flourished\r\nat the commencement of the sixteenth century, was more happy in his\r\nchoice of an epic subject. The hero of his story is Pelayo, the brave\r\ndescendant of the visigothic kings, who, in his turn, was the first to\r\nsubdue the Arabs. But Pinciano’s poem, which he entitled _El Pelayo_,\r\nhad no better fate than the Caroliads.[260]\r\n\r\nThe present seems a fit opportunity for mentioning _La fuente de\r\nAlcover_, a narrative poem, which though of humbler pretensions than\r\nthe Caroliads, experienced considerable success. The author, Felipe\r\nMey, who was of Flemish extraction, was a bookseller in Valencia.\r\nEncouraged by his patron, Antonio Agustin, bishop of Tarragona, he\r\nchose a few stanzas, written by that ingenious prelate, as the ground\r\nwork of a mythological poem. The idea originated in the name given to\r\na plant (_capillus veneris_), through which the water trickling drop\r\nby drop, at length forms a little fountain. This pretty poem makes,\r\nalong with some others by Felipe Mey, an appendix to his unfinished\r\ntranslation of _Ovid’s Metamorphoses_ in octave verse. It deserves also\r\nto be mentioned, that this translation reads like a modern poem; both\r\nlanguage and versification are excellent.[261]\r\n\r\nSome other translations of the ancient classic poets which appeared,\r\nduring this period, remain to be noticed. Gonzalo Perez, a native of\r\nArragon, is the author of a poetic translation of Homer’s Odyssey, in\r\nthe Castilian language. The first edition was printed in 1552, and the\r\nsecond in 1562; so that it seems the Spanish public felt an interest\r\nin this extension of their poetic literature. Gregorio Fernandez\r\ntranslated the Æneid and several of Virgil’s eclogues in verse; and\r\nin the like manner Juan de Guzman executed a complete version of the\r\ngeorgics. All these translations, however, like those of Luis de Leon,\r\nmust be regarded as re-casts of ancient materials into modern moulds,\r\nrather than translations, in the strict sense of the term. But, in an\r\nage and country, in which both the people and the language were imbued\r\nwith the spirit of the romantic poetry, to have attempted to introduce\r\nthe classic poets of Greece or Rome in any other way than in a romantic\r\ndress, would have been to do violence to the genius of the language and\r\nthe nation.[262]\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROGRESS OF THE ROMANTIC POETRY--CASTILLEJO: HIS CONTEST WITH THE\r\n    PARTIZANS OF THE ITALIAN STYLE.\r\n\r\nThe rapid success of the imitators of the Italian and classic styles,\r\ndid not, however, deprive the old romance poetry of its rank, either\r\nin literature or in public estimation. The first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, was doubtless the period when most of the old romances, then\r\nfirst brought together in collections, received the form which they\r\nhave retained down to the present day; and, in all probability, not\r\nless than half the romances and canciones collected in the _Romanceros\r\ngenerales_, particularly the mythological, anacreontic, and comic\r\nkinds, had no existence previous to that period.\r\n\r\nBut no poet of that age defended the cause of the old Castilian poetry,\r\nin all its various forms, with so much talent and zeal as Christoval\r\nde Castillejo, the most illustrious of the literary opponents of\r\nthe Italian style. Castillejo obtained the post of secretary in\r\nthe service of the Emperor Ferdinand I. an appointment which was a\r\nconsequence of the relations still subsisting between the courts of\r\nMadrid and Vienna, after the death of Charles V. notwithstanding that\r\nthe German empire was then separated from the Spanish monarchy. The\r\ngreater part of Castillejo’s poems were written in Vienna; and are\r\nfull of allusions to the gay sphere of life in which he moved at the\r\nimperial court. A young German lady, named Schomburg, of whom he seems\r\nto have been an ardent admirer, figures in his poems, under the name of\r\nXomburg, because nothing like the hissing sound of the German _sch_,\r\ncould be expressed by the same characters in the Castilian language.\r\nAdvanced in life, and tired of gallantry and the gay world, he returned\r\nto Spain, became a Cistercian monk, and died in a convent in 1596.\r\nThe admirers of Castillejo[263] assign to him the first rank among\r\nSpanish poets; but the unprejudiced critic cannot, in justice, elevate\r\nhim to so high a station. His poetic horizon was very limited. He was\r\ndetermined to be nothing but an old Castilian in poetic taste, as in\r\nevery thing else. He ridiculed Boscan, Garcilaso, and all the Spanish\r\npoets of the new party, with more wit than judgment.[264] He asserted,\r\nthough without foundation, that the old Castilian metres and forms\r\nof rhyme were alone suited to the Castilian language; and for want\r\nof better arguments to urge against the amatory poetry of Italy, he\r\nasserted that all poetry of love was to be regarded as mere raillery,\r\nwithout reflecting, that in supporting this opinion he cast more\r\nreproach on the old Spaniards than on the Italians.[265] The structure\r\nof Italian verse appeared constrained to a poet, who confounded\r\nrapidity with facility of style. The loose rhythm of the redondillas,\r\nwas with him an exclusive beauty of the syllabic structure of his\r\nmother tongue, for he had no taste for a more regular style of poetry;\r\nand some of his happiest productions are limited merely to graceful\r\nplays of the imagination. His fertility in these sports of fancy, could\r\nnot fail to obtain for him the esteem of his countrymen, who were\r\never too ready to tolerate, and even to admire, the subtle twisting\r\nof quaint and fanciful conceits; but of all other poetic faults, most\r\nreluctant to pardon heaviness of manner, particularly in versification.\r\n\r\nSome of Castillejo’s canciones are, however, so exquisite, that it is\r\nscarcely possible to resist the temptation of placing their author in\r\nthe very foremost rank of poets.[266] But in spite of his captivating\r\nfluency of style and power of expression, most of his works bear\r\ntraces of a mental boundary which every great poet oversteps. A sort\r\nof affected verbosity often usurps the place of real wit, particularly\r\nin his longer poems; and it not unfrequently happens that whole pages\r\nof Castillejo’s flowing verse are to the reader nothing more than\r\nlively prose. The strong inclination to levity, which he cannot resist,\r\neven when he wishes to be serious, is a distinguishing feature in all\r\nthe poetic essays of this ingenious author, who has thus sometimes\r\ngiven to his works more of a French than a Spanish character.\r\n\r\nCastillejo arranged his lyric works in three books, and they are so\r\nprinted under the title of _Obras Liricas_. Only a small portion of\r\nthese poems, however, properly belongs to the lyric class;[267] and\r\nthe author doubtless collected them together, under this general\r\ntitle, for the purpose of distinguishing them from his comedies, which\r\nare but little known. The first book contains amatory poems, (_Obras\r\namatorias_), songs, jests, epistles, glosses after the old fashion,\r\nand in conclusion, a piece which he styled a (_Capitulo_) on love. The\r\nsongs, for the most part, commence in a serious tone,[268] but speedily\r\nassume a comic turn, with which they usually conclude.[269] Some are\r\nburlesque parodies on the affected ecstasies and extravagant metaphors\r\nof the Spanish sonnet writers. Such, for example, is the “Tower of\r\nLamentation,” or the “Wind Tower,” (_Torre de Viento_,) which is\r\nsupposed to be built entirely of lovers’ sighs. Some shorter poems, in\r\nthe madrigal style, are among the best in this first book.[270] There\r\nis also an “Exclamatory Epistle,” (_Epistola Exclamatoria_,) the spirit\r\nand style of which are sufficiently indicated by the title. Among the\r\npopular verses which the playful humour of Castillejo prompted him to\r\ngloss in the form of _Villancicos_, is one which merely says, “If you\r\ntend my cows, my love, I will give you a kiss; but give me a kiss and I\r\nwill tend yours.”[271] Productions of this description found favour\r\nwith the readers for whom they were intended. His humorous poems, which\r\nare all more or less disguised under an air of seriousness, contain\r\na tale (_historia_) imitated from Ovid, which may be called an idyl\r\naccording to the literary terminology of the Spaniards. The second book\r\ncontains conversational and diverting pieces, (_obras de conversacion\r\ny de pasatiempo_.) At the commencement appear the railleries of\r\nCastillejo against the Petrarchists. The longest poem in this book is\r\na Dialogue on Women, (_Dialogo de la Condicion de las Mugeres_,) which\r\nis here and there enlivened by admirable sallies of wit;[272] but upon\r\nthe whole it is nothing more than burlesque prose ideas dressed in\r\neasy verse.[273] The third book, which contains moral works, (_obras\r\nmorales_,) is most prolix of all. The satires contained in this third\r\nbook have certainly a moral tendency, though that object is in a great\r\nmeasure defeated by Castillejo’s sportive style. The moral is lost in a\r\ntorrent of words, while the serious thoughts of which the verse is the\r\nvehicle, are for the most part trivial.[274] Notwithstanding the moral\r\ndesign of this third book, the Spanish inquisition was for some time\r\nundecided with respect to its fate. The publication of all the poems\r\nof Castillejo was prohibited; but after some further deliberation the\r\ninquisition permitted the sale of an edition, after it had undergone a\r\nrigid revisal by the censor.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HISTORY OF SPANISH DRAMATIC POETRY, DURING THE FIRST HALF AND TEN\r\n    SUCCEEDING YEARS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Charles V. amidst a throng of diversified talent, and\r\nduring the conflict between the old and new poetic styles, the Spanish\r\ndrama began to flourish. Considered in a literary point of view, it\r\ncan scarcely be said to have existed before that period; but it\r\narose under happier auspices than those which about the same period\r\naccompanied the birth of the Italian drama, to which the struggle\r\nbetween the learned and the popular burlesque styles afforded less\r\nhope of success. The sacred and profane pastoral dialogues of Juan de\r\nla Enzina were, at the commencement of the sixteenth century, still\r\nthe only dramatic compositions in the Spanish language, to which any\r\ndegree of literary respect was attached, and they were, by especial\r\nfavour, allowed to be performed at court.[275] With the exception of\r\nmysteries, spiritual moralities, and burlesque representations of\r\nreligious ceremonies, the Spanish nation, at this time, knew nothing\r\nof dramatic entertainments. No poet of reputation had hitherto devoted\r\nhis attention to this species of composition; but the nation evinced\r\nby its attachment to those rude exhibitions, that tenacity which is\r\na great feature in its character, and which even in matters of taste\r\npermits no reform to take place which does not perfectly accord with\r\nthe inclination of the public. This constancy of the national character\r\nmust never for a moment be lost sight of, while tracing the history of\r\nthe Spanish drama; but even with this peculiar circumstance carefully\r\nkept in view, it is still impossible to give a very satisfactory\r\naccount of the early progress of dramatic poetry among the Spaniards;\r\nfor the notices which must be resorted to for that purpose, are both\r\ndefective and confused.[276]\r\n\r\nIt is above all things necessary to begin by distinguishing the three\r\nor four parties, which on totally different principles endeavoured\r\nto cultivate dramatic poetry in Spain, and which appear to have been\r\nhitherto overlooked by the writers on Spanish literature, merely\r\nbecause each of those parties pursued its object, without openly\r\ndeclaring war against the others. Critical cultivation was not yet so\r\nfar advanced in Spain as to open a field for literary warfare. But the\r\nheterogeneous nature of the Spanish dramas of the first half and ten\r\nfollowing years of the sixteenth century, renders it evident, on a very\r\nslight examination, that the authors who composed them must have been\r\ninfluenced by different views.[277]\r\n\r\nThe party called the erudite, was the first which at that period\r\nlaboured to introduce into Spain a style of dramatic literature, worthy\r\nto be called national. This party consisted of men of information\r\nand taste, though possessing but little knowledge of the true art of\r\ndramatic poetry, and still less of imagination. These men, like a\r\nsimilar party in Italy, endeavoured to form the modern drama on the\r\nmodel of the antique. As, however, the most zealous among them did\r\nnot possess sufficient talent to imitate the ancient models, they\r\nbegan to translate them, and performed their task in prose. A Spanish\r\ntranslation of the Amphitryon of Plautus, by Villalobos, physician to\r\nCharles V. was printed in 1515. Shortly afterwards there appeared a\r\nnew translation of the same drama, by Perez de Oliva, a prose writer\r\nof considerable merit, who will be further noticed in the course of\r\nthis history. Perez de Oliva even ventured to make a prose version\r\nof the Electra of Sophocles. This unfortunate attempt appeared under\r\nthe title of _La Venganza de Agamemnon_.[278] He also translated the\r\nHecuba of Euripides. At a somewhat later period the Portuguese comedies\r\nof Vasconcellos, written in the manner of Plautus, were published in\r\nthe Castilian language. Translations of several comedies of Plautus\r\nsubsequently appeared, and at length Pedro Simon de Abril published a\r\ncomplete translation of Terence, which is still much esteemed by the\r\nSpaniards.[279] Thus it was not the fault of the erudite party that\r\nthe Spanish drama did not resemble the ancient. But to introduce in\r\nSpain the tragic style of the classic drama, in all its poetic purity,\r\nor even the style of the ancient comedies in iambic verse, was an idea\r\nwhich could only have originated with scholars who did not understand\r\nthe character of the Spanish public. The translators, therefore, even\r\nthose who endeavoured to conciliate the public taste by prose versions,\r\nformed, with their learned friends, a solitary party. No first rate\r\npoet arose in Spain, like Ariosto in Italy, to amuse and instruct the\r\npublic by original dramatic compositions on the classic model. It is\r\npossible that essays in the ancient manner may have been performed on\r\nsome Spanish stage, particularly at Seville, but they are now totally\r\nlost; and no attempt seems ever to have been made to represent Spanish\r\ntranslations of Greek and Latin plays.\r\n\r\nThe party of the dramatic moralists approximated the closest to\r\nthat which has just been described. The interlocutory romance of\r\nCœlestina,[280] or Calistus and Melibœa, poor in invention, but\r\npossessing in its natural descriptions of common life, an attraction\r\nfor many readers, was, on account of its moral tendency, admired as\r\na master-piece of dramatic art. As this dramatic romance was called\r\na comedy or tragi-comedy, some of its admirers conceived themselves\r\nbound to write comedies and tragi-comedies in the same style for the\r\nmoral benefit of society. Whether these productions were, or were not,\r\ncalculated for representation, seems never to have been a subject of\r\nconsideration with their authors. They were content if the scenes\r\nwhich they strung together exhibited in natural language the lowest\r\npictures of common life, and forcibly marked the dangers attendant\r\non vice. To do this requires only an ordinary share of talent, and\r\naccordingly Cœlestina was followed by a torrent of similar “Mirrors of\r\nSin” in the Castilian language. The greater number appeared during the\r\nfirst half of the sixteenth century, or shortly afterwards; and among\r\nthem were _Policiana_, entitled a tragedy;[281] _Perseus and Tibaldea_,\r\na comedy; _De la hechicera_ (of the Witch), a comedy; _Florinea_, a\r\ncomedy, &c. The author of a work of this kind, entitled _La Doleria del\r\nSueño del Mundo_, (the Anguish of the Sleep of the World,) mentions\r\nin his title-page, that it is a comedy in the style of philosophic\r\nmorality, (_Comedia tratada por via de philosophia moral_.) All these\r\ninsipid moral lessons were read and admired in their day; but their\r\nextreme length prevented them from getting possession of the stage.[282]\r\n\r\nEqually removed from the moral and the erudite party, was Bartholomè\r\nTorres Naharro, a man doubtless of extraordinary talent. He was the\r\nfounder of a third party, which uniting with a fourth, that had for a\r\nshort interval preceded it, ultimately triumphed as the only national\r\nparty, and obtained exclusive control over the Spanish drama. It\r\nis a singular circumstance, and yet one to which the historians of\r\nSpanish literature have not called the attention of their readers,\r\nthat Cervantes in his comic sketch of the early History of the Spanish\r\nDrama, mentions not a syllable respecting Torres Naharro, while the\r\neditor of Cervantes’s comedies, who has prefixed to them that sketch,\r\ndeclares, in his preface, Torres Naharro to be the real inventor of the\r\nforms of the Spanish comedy. Torres Naharro was born in the little town\r\nof Torre, on the Portuguese frontiers, and flourished in the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century. Of the history of his life but little is\r\nknown. All accounts, however, agree in describing him to have been an\r\necclesiastic and a man of learning. After a shipwreck which involved\r\nhim in various adventures, he arrived at Rome during the pontificate of\r\nLeo X. In that friend of genius he found a distinguished patron. It is,\r\nhowever, extremely improbable, that his comedies were performed before\r\nthe pope at Rome, though such an assertion has been made by Spanish\r\nwriters, and has given offence to some Italians. It is certainly by no\r\nmeans likely, that an occurrence so unusual, should have escaped the\r\nnotice of all Italian authors; and Pope Leo can scarcely be supposed\r\nto have had any strong inducement to study the Spanish language which\r\nis not agreeable to Italian ears. It is more probable that Naharro’s\r\ncomedies were represented in Naples, for there a Spanish audience\r\nwas to be found; and Naharro himself proceeded to Naples when the\r\ndifficulties into which his satirical writings involved him, obliged\r\nhim to quit Rome.\r\n\r\nThe above are the only particulars that can be obtained respecting\r\nthe life of this extraordinary man; and it is not certain how far\r\nthey can be relied on, as they are gathered from writers who do not\r\nmention the sources from whence they derived their information.[283]\r\nIt is not improbable that Naharro’s comedies were performed only in\r\nNaples, and not in Spain, where there was no theatre suited to their\r\nrepresentation; for according to the account of Cervantes, who speaks\r\nas an eye-witness, the whole apparatus of a Spanish theatre, about the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century, consisted of a few boards and benches,\r\nand a wardrobe, and decorations, which were contained in a sack.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may have been the fate of the comedies of Naharro, with\r\nrespect to the stage in Spain, they were certainly printed along with\r\nthe other poetic works of the author, in the year 1521, or at latest\r\nin 1533, under the learned title of _Propaladia_, intended to signify\r\nexercises in the school of Pallas.[284] Judging from the accounts\r\ngiven of these dramas by various writers, there is very little doubt\r\nthat Torres Naharro was the real inventor of the Spanish comedy. He not\r\nonly wrote his eight comedies in redondillas in the romance style, but\r\nhe also endeavoured to establish the dramatic interest solely on an\r\ningenious combination of intrigues, without attaching much importance\r\nto the developement of character, or the moral tendency of the story.\r\nIt is besides probable, that he was the first who divided plays into\r\nthree acts, which being regarded as three days labour in the dramatic\r\nfield, were called _jornadas_.[285] It must, therefore, be unreservedly\r\nadmitted, that these dramas, considered both with respect to their\r\nspirit and their form, deserve to be ranked as the first in the history\r\nof the Spanish national drama; for in the same path which Torres\r\nNaharro first trod, the dramatic genius of Spain advanced to the point\r\nattained by Calderon, and the nation tolerated no dramas except those\r\nwhich belonged to the style which had thus been created.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, however, that there was something in the plays of\r\nNaharro which did not precisely harmonize with the taste of the Spanish\r\npublic, for they were banished from literature and thrown into oblivion\r\nby the prose dramas which Cervantes saw represented in his youth. The\r\nauthor of these pieces, in which songs are sometimes episodically\r\nintroduced, was Lope de Rueda, a native of Seville. This man, who was\r\na gold-beater by trade, and who had received no literary education,\r\nwas notwithstanding endowed with a strong genius for the dramatic art.\r\nCervantes styles him the great Lope de Rueda. He did not compose his\r\nplays in the character of an author. He was at the head of a little\r\ncompany of players of whom he was himself the ablest; and his own\r\ntaste and that of the public required only such pieces as could be\r\neasily represented on his wretched stage which consisted merely of a\r\nfew planks of wood. The most prominent characters in Lope de Rueda’s\r\ndramatic compositions, were those which the author himself performed,\r\nand which, according to the testimony of Cervantes, he delineated in\r\na highly natural style. In fools, roguish servants, biscayan boors,\r\nand such like characters, he particularly excelled. He did not neglect\r\nto avail himself of the accidental union of the Spanish drama with\r\npastoral poetry, and he wrote some pastoral dialogues (_coloquios\r\npastoriles_) in prose. On this account his theatrical wardrobe, of\r\nwhich Cervantes gives a humorous description, contained four shepherds\r\ndresses of white fur, trimmed with gold, an equal number of wigs and\r\nshepherds crooks, and likewise four beards. The beards, it would\r\nappear were indispensable in comedies of every kind; and the public\r\nbecame so accustomed to call an old man’s part in comedy the _beard_,\r\nthat the theatrical term _barba_ was retained even after the custom of\r\nwearing beards had long been exploded from the stage.\r\n\r\nJuan Timoneda has made careful collections of the comedies and\r\npastoral dramas of Lope de Rueda, by which we are enabled to judge\r\nof the literary merit of these works, divested of the advantage\r\nwhich they must have derived from the living representation of their\r\nauthor. Timoneda, who was a bookseller in Valencia, was the friend\r\nand enthusiastic admirer of Lope de Rueda; but in regard to literary\r\nacquirements he ranked somewhat higher than that actor. He was indeed\r\na man of genius and talent, as is evident from his novels, which are\r\nlittle known, and which have yet to be more particularly noticed in\r\nthis work. He printed in small collections, the pastoral dialogues and\r\nplays of Lope de Rueda, making such alterations as were necessary both\r\nin the language and style.[286] These productions equally indicate the\r\nexperienced master in the developement of character, and the untutored\r\npupil of nature following his own caprice. Lope de Rueda’s pastoral\r\ndialogues possess more dignity, if the term may be used, than his\r\nplays, and they are moreover imbued with a certain poetic character\r\nwhich harmonizes admirably with the songs occasionally introduced. With\r\nregard to invention and style, however, there is but little difference\r\nbetween the dialogues and the plays, but the pastoral costume of the\r\ndramatis personæ produces a certain heterogeneous effect; for the half\r\nArcadian, and half Spanish shepherds, are brought in contact with\r\nnegresses, barbers, and other characters of common life and modern\r\nstamp. Lope de Rueda was not inattentive to general character, as is\r\nproved by his delineation of old men, clowns, &c. in which he was\r\nparticularly successful. But his principal aim was to interweave in\r\nhis dramas, a succession of intrigues; and, as he seems to have been a\r\nstranger to the art of producing stage effect by striking situations,\r\nhe made complication the great object of his plots. Thus mistakes,\r\narising from personal resemblances, exchanges of children, and such\r\nlike common place subjects of intrigue, form the ground work of his\r\nstories, none of which are remarkable for ingenuity of invention.\r\nThere is usually a multitude of characters in his dramas, and jests\r\nand witticisms are freely introduced, but these in general consist of\r\nburlesque disputes in which some clown is engaged.[287]\r\n\r\nIt would appear that many comedies in Rueda’s style were at one\r\ntime acted, though they are now lost to literature. Cervantes, for\r\ninstance, praises the perfection to which that style of comic drama\r\nhad been brought by a player, named Naharro of Toledo, who must not be\r\nconfounded with Torres Naharro. Cervantes informs us, that this Naharro\r\naugmented the theatrical wardrobe so considerably, that it could no\r\nlonger be contained in a bag, but was packed up in boxes and chests.\r\nHe exploded the custom of dressing the old characters in beards, and\r\nremoved the orchestra, which had previously been stationed behind the\r\nscenes, to the front of the stage. He moreover exhibited imitations\r\nof clouds, of thunder and lightning, made other great improvements in\r\nthe scenic machinery, (_tramoyas_), and even introduced single combats\r\nand battles on the stage. His name certainly deserves to be preserved\r\nfrom oblivion; and it is unfortunate that Cervantes has neglected to\r\nmention what kind of poetry or prose was spoken by the actors in these\r\nnew dramatic spectacles.\r\n\r\nA Spanish author of learning and merit, named Juan de la Cueva, who\r\nlived about this period, seems to have been the first to perceive that\r\nthe Spanish drama could never succeed, if men of literary acquirements,\r\nendowed with genius for dramatic composition, continued opposed to\r\nthe popular party. This meritorious author was a native of Seville,\r\nwhich at that time appears to have been the cradle of every kind of\r\ntalent. The history of his life is enveloped in obscurity, and his\r\nvarious writings, in every class of poetry, notwithstanding the praises\r\nwhich critics have bestowed on them, are, though not totally sunk into\r\noblivion, very little known.[288] His copious Art of Poetry in tercets,\r\nwhich was lately, for the first time, published from manuscript,\r\ncontains some important information relative to the history of Spanish\r\npoetry. It is, however, merely written in good versified prose, and\r\npure language, but is in no respect poetical.[289] This Art of Poetry,\r\nif so it must be called, shews, among other things, how numerous was\r\nthe party which at that time endeavoured to give to the Spanish drama\r\nthe form of the antique. An author, named Malara, a native of Seville,\r\nwho was called the Betisian Menander, in allusion to the Betis or\r\nGaudalquivir, and six other poets of that city, among whom is Gutierre\r\nde Cetina, the celebrated author of several Spanish comedies in the\r\nancient style, are honourably mentioned by Juan de la Cueva. But this\r\njudicious writer maintained that there were peculiarities in the\r\nancient drama, which, though excellent in themselves, would not accord\r\nwith the spirit of the moderns. The dramatic laws of the ancients had,\r\nin his opinion, ceased to be obligatory; and he conceived it to be\r\nreasonable that dramatic fictions should be accommodated to the taste\r\nof the age and to the circumstances in which they are written.[290]\r\nThe Spanish public had already manifested a strong predilection for\r\nplays in the modern style, and an aversion equally decided from all\r\nthe imitations of the dramatic works of the ancients. It was therefore\r\ndesignedly and with a persevering industry that the Spaniards had\r\nstruck out for themselves a new course in dramatic literature. In\r\ngenius and taste they could only have vied with the Greeks and Romans,\r\nwithout surpassing them; but invention, grace, ingenious arrangement,\r\nand a certain art of involving and unravelling the plot, which\r\nforeigners could not imitate, were the qualities on which the glory\r\nof the Spanish drama was destined to be founded.[291] Juan de la\r\nCueva proceeds to state, that on these principles he had no scruple\r\nin contributing to overthrow the ancient boundary between tragedy\r\nand comedy; and to introduce on the stage, for the sake of variety,\r\ncharacters clad in the rustic peasant’s garb, along with others\r\nattired in the robes of royalty. Thus far he trod in the footsteps of\r\nTorres Naharro. And yet he appears to have had no distinct knowledge\r\nof the writings of that author; for he never mentions them; while, on\r\nthe other hand, speaking of his own works, he observes that he had\r\nabandoned the old custom of dividing dramatic pieces into five acts,\r\nand chose in preference the new method, then in vogue, of arranging\r\nthem in jornadas.[292] Cervantes must of course have been ignorant\r\nof the decided testimony thus given by Juan de la Cueva, since he\r\nimagines that he was himself the first to introduce the three divisions\r\nof the Spanish drama. The approbation bestowed on Cueva’s dramatic\r\nworks, in the new style, seems, however, to have been but feeble and\r\ntransitory; and this explains how the editor of Cervantes’s comedies,\r\nin his account of the early history of the Spanish drama, has omitted\r\nto mention the name of Cueva.\r\n\r\nIt will, perhaps, be proper to defer entering more fully into the\r\ninvestigation of the peculiar spirit of the Spanish national drama,\r\nuntil the writings of Lope de Vega come under consideration; for during\r\nthe brilliant career of that author, the new form of the drama took\r\ncomplete possession of the Spanish theatre, and the older pieces, which\r\ndid not fall in with the popular taste, were speedily forgotten by the\r\npublic, as the notices of Cervantes clearly shew. But it may be proper\r\nhere once for all to remind the reader of a truth now historically\r\ndemonstrated, namely, that it was by no means ignorance, or want of\r\nintimacy with the dramatic works of the ancients, which facilitated the\r\ntriumph of the modern Spanish drama.\r\n\r\nNo sufficiently authenticated particulars enable the literary historian\r\nto furnish any thing like positive information respecting the history\r\nof the spiritual dramas of the Spaniards at the period now under\r\nreview. Considered generally their origin is sufficiently known; for\r\ndramas of this kind, intended either for amusement or instruction,\r\nwere, in the middle ages, performed throughout the whole of the south\r\nof Europe. In Spain, pilgrims assiduously devoted themselves to the\r\ndramatic representation of sacred histories, when they wished to find\r\nan edifying and agreeable relaxation from their severer duties of\r\npraying and journeying from place to place. In these sacred dramas,\r\nthe authors often interwove the adventures, whether serious or comic,\r\nin which they had been engaged, or described what they had seen and\r\nlearnt in their holy pilgrimages; and the whole was usually seasoned\r\nwith a sufficient quantity of jests in the popular style. To manifest\r\nin as palpable a way as possible the power of the sacrament, and the\r\nmiraculous effects of faith, were the great objects of the pilgrims;\r\nand there seems to be no doubt that their rude efforts formed the\r\norigin of that class of spiritual plays, which, at a subsequent\r\nperiod, were performed on the festival of Corpus Christi, and on\r\nother solemn occasions; and which, from their allusion to the mystery\r\nof the sacrament, were styled _Autos Sacramentales_. But at what\r\nparticular period examples of these spiritual exhibitions were first\r\ncommitted to writing, and formed a portion of literature, cannot now be\r\nascertained. They have sometimes been confounded with the lives of the\r\nsaints (_vidas de santos_[293]), which were originally dramatized in\r\nmonasteries, and performed by the pupils of the monks, but which are in\r\nfact quite a distinct class of representations. Up to the middle of the\r\neighteenth century the practice of acting these biographical dramas was\r\ncontinued in monasteries in different parts of Spain, particularly in\r\nGalicia;[294] and perhaps in that province they yet afford a source of\r\namusement and edification on festival days, to the pilgrims who visit\r\nthe shrine of St. Iago de Compostela.\r\n\r\nThe burlesque interludes, called _Entremeses_ and _Saynetes_, which\r\nwere subsequently divided into various kinds, and were performed\r\nbetween the preludes (_loas_) and the play, properly so called, appear\r\nalso to have had their origin in the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Cervantes could refer to no entremeses of an older date,\r\nwhen he contributed to give to this class of dramatic compositions a\r\nliterary form and character.\r\n\r\nWhat has been stated sufficiently proves the powerful control which\r\nthe public exercised over the stage. The popular taste demanded an\r\nagreeable amusement, created by the boldest and most varied mixture of\r\nthe serious and the comic, of intrigues, sallies of the imagination\r\nand ingenious thoughts, of surprises and animated situations; but it\r\nwas not required that either a comic or a tragic scene should tend to\r\nproduce any moral impression on the heart, except indeed in so far\r\nas that object may be attributed to the spiritual pieces. But how\r\ndid it happen that a people in whom moral gravity has ever been a\r\nnational characteristic, should thus shew themselves indifferent to\r\nthe moral effects of their dramatic entertainments. The history of the\r\nformation of the Spanish character appears to disclose the cause of\r\nthis incongruity so clearly, that it might be said, nature would have\r\ncontradicted herself, had not such been the consequence resulting from\r\nthat cause. When the treasures of America came to be dispersed through\r\nSpain, luxury and extravagance superseded the old Spanish simplicity.\r\nThe age of chivalry was past; and the ecclesiastical fetters imposed\r\nupon opinion and conscience, afforded so little freedom to the mind,\r\nthat it was not possible the public could endure, still less enjoy,\r\nmoral reflection on the stage. The Spaniard, as a catholic Christian,\r\ndevoutly and implicitly submitted his understanding to the doctrines\r\nand mandates of the church; but as a man he ardently longed for\r\namusements, in which he might allow his heart freely to participate.\r\nMoral reflection then could not be pleasing in any place where he\r\nsought to be gratified by the unconstrained exercise of his feelings;\r\nfor every moral thought tended to revive the recollection of the\r\ninquisition. Meanwhile the progress of luxury and the love of pleasure\r\nstimulated the imagination, and increased the appetite for sports\r\nof wit and fancy, which were pushed to the most extravagant excess.\r\nA people of an ardent and enthusiastic temperament, which a genial\r\nclimate fostered, were always eager to partake of pleasures which no\r\nking or grand inquisitor threatened to disturb. With a taste thus\r\nformed, and with such claims on dramatic entertainment, the Spaniards\r\nwere not to be satisfied with the most ingenious comedies or tragedies,\r\nunless the wildest revels of the imagination and a succession of joyous\r\nand luxuriant forms agitated and interested the mind, and freed it from\r\nall the fetters of maxims and rules of art. To see a variegated ideal\r\nworld, a diversified picture of romantic existence, was the object for\r\nwhich the Spaniard visited the theatre, where he could endure no sort\r\nof regularity, not even that which the nature of the subject seemed\r\nmost to require.\r\n\r\nThis portion of the history of Spanish dramatic poetry must not be\r\nterminated without a particular notice of two tragedies by Geronymo\r\nBermudez, a Dominican monk of Galicia, who, at the period when he\r\nwrote them, was probably the inmate of a cloister.[295] He did not\r\nthink proper to acknowledge himself the author of these dramas, and\r\nhe published them under the assumed name of Antonio de Silva.[296]\r\nAmong his other poetical works, some Spanish writers mention in\r\nterms of respect, a dull encomium on the Duke of Alba, of whom this\r\necclesiastic was an enthusiastic admirer.[297] He lived until the\r\nyear 1589. His two tragedies are imitations of the ancient drama,\r\nbut they must not be confounded with the essays of the same kind,\r\nwhich have already been mentioned. Bermudez conceived the happy idea\r\nof selecting a subject from the history of Spain and Portugal, and\r\ndramatizing it according to the rules of the Greek tragedy, without\r\ndestroying the modern character of his materials. The well known story\r\nof the unfortunate Ines de Castro, seemed particularly suited to the\r\nobject he had in view. Being a Galician, he had, through his native\r\nlanguage, a national relationship to Portugal, and he consequently\r\ntook more personal interest in the tragical fate of his heroine,\r\nthan was felt by Spaniards in general. He did not commence his task\r\nwithout apprehension of its success; for, as a Spaniard, he wished\r\nto write in Castilian, and he was, therefore, in some measure, under\r\nthe necessity of studying a foreign language. This difficulty he\r\nmentions in his preface. But with all its faults, his attempt proved\r\nso fortunate, that his two tragedies may justly be styled the first\r\nin their kind. Though they are intimately connected, yet each forms\r\nin itself a complete tragic drama. Their titles are whimsical and\r\naffected: the first is denominated, _Nise Lastimosa_, (the Lamentable\r\nNise); and the second, _Nise Laureada_, (Nise Crowned with Glory).[298]\r\nThe characters preserve their historical names. The first of these\r\ntragedies sufficiently proves what may be effected by a poet, even of\r\nmoderate talent, when thoroughly penetrated with a poetic subject,\r\nand at the same time possessing the power of expression. The Nise\r\nLastimosa, it is true, is far from approaching the ideal of tragic\r\nperfection; but some of the scenes fulfil all that the theory of the\r\ndramatic art can require; and energy and dignity of expression are not\r\nwanting even in those passages where the action is tedious and the\r\nincidents ill-connected. The plot is simple, and towards the conclusion\r\nits interest declines. But Bermudez has introduced, with alternate\r\ninstances of remarkable dexterity and clumsiness, a chorus composed\r\nof Coimbran women, which is sometimes interwoven with the action of\r\nthe drama, and sometimes quite independent of it. The unities of time\r\nand place the author has totally disregarded. The first act opens\r\nwith a soliloquy by the Prince Don Pedro, which is beautiful, though\r\nsomewhat too long. In it the prince deplores his separation from his\r\nbeloved wife.[299] This soliloquy is succeeded by a long conversation\r\nbetween the prince and his secretary, in which the latter, with all\r\ndue courtesy, hints that the attachment of the prince for a lady, not\r\nof royal birth, is incompatible with the welfare of the state.[300]\r\nThe scene then changes, and the chorus of Coimbran women is very\r\nabsurdly introduced to moralize on love. Thus closes the first act.\r\nIn the second, the scene changes to the court, and exhibits the king\r\namidst his assembled council; the advice of the ministers prevails over\r\nthe good disposition of the monarch, and he consents to the death of\r\nInes de Castro. A soliloquy by the king follows, in which he offers\r\nup his prayers. The scene again changes, and the fair Coimbrans once\r\nmore appear to moralize on human happiness. In the third act, however,\r\na new spirit is infused into the piece, and the chorus partakes in\r\nthe action. Ines de Castro appears. The women of the chorus form her\r\nattendants, and offer her consolation and advice. Ines is informed\r\nof the reports that are circulated respecting her fate;[301] but\r\nthroughout this act, the progress of the story is nearly suspended.\r\nThe fourth act may, however, be accounted almost a masterpiece. Ines\r\nattended by her children and the chorus, appears before the king to\r\nreceive her sentence. Nothing can be more impressive than the dignity\r\nwith which she demands justice, or more affecting than the tenderness\r\ntowards her children, which continually breaks forth in her discourse;\r\nat length she pictures to herself in vivid colours, the sorrows that\r\nawait her husband, till exhausted by the vehemence of her feelings, and\r\ngradually losing the use of her faculties, she begins for the first\r\ntime to think of her own situation, anticipates the horrors of death,\r\nand swoons, exclaiming _Jesus Maria!_ This scene exhibits a picture so\r\nreplete with real pathos, that it may be truly said, modern tragic art\r\nhas seldom attained so high a point of perfection.[302] The fifth act\r\nis merely a tedious supplement. The prince is made acquainted with the\r\ndeath of his wife, and he vents his sorrow in long lamentations.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of _Nise Laureada_ is far inferior to that just described.\r\nThe story is below criticism; and towards the end becomes revolting\r\nto feelings, which are not blunted by inquisitorial horrors, or sunk\r\nto the level of brutality. The Prince Don Pedro who has now ascended\r\nthe throne, orders the remains of his judicially murdered wife to\r\nbe taken from the tomb; he then, with great solemnity, invests the\r\ncorpse with the dignity of queen, and the ceremony of the coronation\r\nis succeeded by a marriage. Two of the counsellors, whose perverted\r\nand inhuman patriotism had urged them to sacrifice the unhappy Ines,\r\nreceive sentence of death and are executed. This is the whole plot,\r\nif so it may be called; and among the acting and speaking characters\r\nthe executioners play a prominent part. The first act contains many\r\nbeautiful passages; but when the last judicial ceremonies commence,\r\nhorror and disgust fill the mind of the reader. The hearts of both\r\nculprits are extracted from their bodies, the one through the breast,\r\nand the other through the back. The most brutal exclamations accompany\r\nthe execution of the royal sentence, and the chorus utters shouts of\r\njoy, while the executioner discharges his barbarous task. That these\r\nhorrors might be regarded as pathetic incidents by the Spaniards of\r\nthat age, accustomed as they were from early childhood to stifle every\r\nsentiment of humanity, and to allow fanatical exultation to overcome\r\nthe natural emotions of the heart, whenever a brutal sentence was\r\npronounced by ecclesiastical, or royal authority, is unfortunately but\r\ntoo probable. Had it not been for this perversion of feeling, a people,\r\notherwise so noble-minded, could not have attended the cruel festivals\r\nof their church, and witnessed the burning of Jews and heretics with as\r\nmuch pleasure as the exhibition of a bull fight.\r\n\r\nIn order to form a just estimate of the talent of Bermudez, it must\r\nbe recollected that he was the first who conceived the idea of giving\r\na poetic colouring to the history of Ines de Castro. Camoens had not,\r\nat that time, written his Lusiad, in which the same story forms the\r\nsubject of a celebrated episode. It may also be observed, that the\r\nlabour which Bermudez bestowed on his versification, and particularly\r\non the varied metres of the choruses of his dramas, ought to have\r\nserved as an example to his successors in tragic composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HISTORY OF SPANISH PROSE DURING THE FIRST HALF AND TEN SUCCEEDING\r\n    YEARS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nAmong the works of the poets which come within the period allotted\r\nto the first section of this book, it has already been necessary to\r\nnotice some writings in prose. The connexion then subsisting between\r\nSpanish poetry and prose, has thus been rendered more apparent, and\r\nthe different works of the same author have been kept together in\r\nexamining them. But the poetic talent of some authors of that age, for\r\nexample, Perez de Oliva, will not bear a comparison with their merits\r\nas prose writers; and many others who have obtained reputation for\r\nprose composition, must be totally excluded from the rank of poets. In\r\ngeneral the good sense of the Spanish writers has constantly impelled\r\nthem to mark a distinct boundary between poetry and prose; and this\r\nseparation was never more rigorously maintained than during the first\r\nhalf of the sixteenth century, when the torrent of romances of chivalry\r\nwhich then inundated Spain, threatened the common annihilation of\r\ngenuine poetry and eloquent prose. As very little has hitherto been\r\ndone in this department of literature, advantage cannot fail to be\r\nderived from the labour which may be employed in endeavouring to obtain\r\nsomething like an accurate introduction to the knowledge of several\r\ngood Spanish prose writers, whose names have hitherto scarcely appeared\r\nin the history of modern literature.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has read Don Quixote must be aware of the enthusiasm\r\nwith which romances of chivalry were admired by the Spaniards, at the\r\nend of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century. In\r\nthe reign of Charles V. this passion became epidemic; for then the\r\nart of printing gave general circulation to the old romances, and new\r\nimitations were not wanting. But the particular account of this portion\r\nof Spanish literature, does not belong to the present subject, and\r\nought to form the conclusion of the history of the romantic literature\r\nof the middle ages. Besides, the influence of the chivalrous romances\r\nof the sixteenth century, operated on the public only in a peculiar\r\nsense of the term, for every poet and prose writer, of cultivated\r\ntalent, laboured to oppose the contagion. There were, however, many\r\nliterary partizans, who did not scruple to flatter the public taste by\r\nthe grossest absurdities. A writer, named Geronymo de Sanpedro, with\r\nthe most devout piety, selected stories from the bible, and clothed\r\nthem, as he expresses himself, in the allegoric costume of romance. He\r\nentitled his fantastical work, “The Book of Celestial Chivalry from\r\nthe Foot of the Fragrant Rose-bush.[303]” God the Father is introduced\r\nin this edifying production as emperor, and Christ as the knight of\r\nthe Lion, (_Caballero del Leon_). In the meantime an opponent of the\r\nzealots of chivalry, named Doctor Alexio de Venegas, anathematized\r\nall romances, which he styled, “Devil’s Sermon Books,” (_Sermonarios\r\nde Satanas_).[304] In this manner parties contended one with another\r\nin Spain, until at length the romantic literature disappeared like a\r\nstream lost amidst sand.\r\n\r\nAt this period there appears to have existed no novels or romances in\r\nthe modern style, except the _Lazarillo de Tormes_ of Diego de Mendoza.\r\nThe well known imitations of this first romance of knavery (_del\r\ngusto picaresco_) did not come into circulation before the end of the\r\nsixteenth century. Little stories in the style of the Italian novels\r\nwere, it is true, written at an earlier period; but their author, the\r\nbookseller Timoneda, the same individual who collected the comedies and\r\npastoral dramas of Lope de Rueda, did not venture to prefix to them\r\nthe title of _Novelas_. He was aware that he could better recommend\r\nhis works to the Spanish public, by giving them the old denomination\r\nof _Patrañas_ (Tales).[305] Timoneda evidently imitated the Italian\r\nnovelists, though he by no means equalled them. Still, however, these\r\nantiquated tales may be perused with pleasure, particularly by those\r\nwho have a taste for complicated intrigue. The author, it would appear,\r\nendeavoured to surpass the Italian writers in romantic adventures and\r\nunexpected incidents; at least in his preface he expressly promises\r\nthis kind of entertainment to his readers.\r\n\r\nBut it was not merely with romances and novels that genuine prose\r\nliterature had to contend in Spain. Several men of distinguished\r\ntalent, however far they carried their notions of patriotism in other\r\nrespects, were of opinion that the Spanish language was incapable\r\nof expressing grave and noble ideas in prose. Some would write\r\nonly in Latin, and others only in Italian. Alphonso de Ulloa, who\r\nwas an assiduous historical and political author, wrote chiefly in\r\nItalian.[306] He was, it is true, born in Italy; but he was of a\r\nSpanish family, and the Spanish language was perfectly familiar to him.\r\nThe want of confidence thus shewn by Spanish writers in the force\r\nand precision of their own language seems inexplicable, when it is\r\nrecollected at how early a period Spanish prose began to be cultivated.\r\nTheir intercourse with the Italians had, however, made the Spaniards\r\nperceive a want of elegance both in their colloquial phraseology and\r\nliterary style; but that grace which their poets soon began to imitate\r\nfrom the Italians, is but feebly indicated in the works of the early\r\nSpanish prose writers, whatever other rhetorical merits they might\r\npossess, and a frank simplicity of expression appears still to have\r\nconstituted the main character of Spanish prose. Besides, the Italian\r\nprose, which with the exception of the writings of Machiavell and\r\nGuicciardini is distinguished by a playful and too often superficial\r\nelegance, could not be very congenial to the Spanish taste, which\r\nrequired a grave and energetic style. To imitate the ancient classics\r\nwas the only means whereby the prose literature of Spain could have\r\nbeen cultivated in a manner answerable to the demands of enlightened\r\nmen in the sixteenth century. Unfortunately the ecclesiastical\r\nand political despotism of this period left no free scope for the\r\nexercise of the mental powers of those Spaniards who were desirous of\r\nconstructing a national prose style on the ancient models. Neither\r\nthe didactic nor the historical styles could be freely developed;\r\nand for the formation of the oratorical style, circumstances were,\r\nif possible, still more unfavourable. Impeded by such obstacles, and\r\npermitted only to copy in the strictest sense the rhetorical forms of\r\nthe ancients, without their energy and solidity of thought, and their\r\nforce of expression, the Spanish prose writers certainly could not\r\nbe expected to produce works worthy to be ranked on a level with the\r\nclassic examples they would have wished to emulate; but their efforts\r\nto open the career of genuine eloquence to their national literature,\r\ndeserves, notwithstanding, to be honourably recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DIDACTIC PROSE is, in the Spanish language, indebted\r\nfor its first formation to Fernan Perez de Oliva of Cordova. At the\r\ncommencement of the sixteenth century this learned man travelled\r\nthrough Italy and France, and during three years which he spent in\r\nParis delivered public lectures on philosophy and ancient literature.\r\nOn his return to Spain he settled at Salamanca, where he became\r\nprofessor (_cathedratico_) of theology, and delivered lectures on the\r\nAristotelian philosophy. He died in 1533, before he had completed his\r\nthirty-sixth year.[307] His philosophic and theological studies, and\r\nhis intimacy with Grecian and Roman literature, did not withhold him\r\nfrom the cultivation of his native language; and he even endeavoured,\r\nby his translations which have already been mentioned,[308] to\r\nnaturalize the Greek tragedy in Spain. He also wrote several poems,\r\nwhich in honour of his memory, are still preserved. But Perez de Oliva\r\nwas no poet; and to judge from his translations he appears to have had\r\nscarcely any true poetic feeling, though he possessed a correct and\r\ndelicate taste for the rhetorical beauty of prose. His most celebrated\r\nwork is his Dialogue on the Dignity of Man (_Dialogo de la Dignidad del\r\nHombre_) in the manner of Cicero.[309] It would be vain to seek in this\r\ndidactic dialogue for ideas which present the merit of novelty in the\r\npresent age; and it can by no means be regarded as a model of dialogue\r\nstyle any more than the similar works of Cicero. But it was the first\r\nspecimen in Spanish literature, of clear and connected discussion,\r\nmaintained in correct dignified and elegant language. The colloquial\r\nform serves to connect, though somewhat loosely, the two portions into\r\nwhich the work is divided. Two philosophic friends meet, and their\r\nconversation turns on solitude: they endeavour to explain the causes\r\nwhich induce man to seek retirement, and which render him dissatisfied\r\nwith the society of his fellow creatures. One of the friends inveighs\r\nagainst human society, while the other extols its advantages. In the\r\nmean while they are joined by a third philosopher who becomes the\r\narbiter. Before this judge each disputant propounds his opinions in\r\nan uninterrupted discourse. Thus the oratorical style is now mingled\r\nwith the didactic, which had before superseded the colloquial style.\r\nThis blending of the didactic and oratorical styles, must doubtless be\r\na subject of critical censure to many readers; but with the exception\r\nof the oratorical passages, the dialogue of Perez de Oliva is written,\r\nin a natural and easy manner.[310] The ideas are for the most part\r\nclearly and accurately developed,[311] and the oratorical language,\r\nparticularly where it is appropriately introduced, is powerful and\r\npicturesque.[312]\r\n\r\nPerez de Oliva had a successful pupil in his nephew Ambrosio de\r\nMorales, who was also a native of Cordova. This learned writer was\r\nborn in the year 1513; after having finished his academic studies at\r\nthe university of Alcala de Henares, he delivered public lectures\r\non philosophy and ancient literature, by which he soon acquired an\r\nhonourable reputation. Charles V. appointed him classical tutor to his\r\nnatural son Don John of Austria, who afterwards became so celebrated.\r\nOn the death of Charles V. Ambrosio de Morales was installed by\r\nKing Philip II. in the vacant post of historiographer or chronicler\r\n(_coronista_) of Castile. From the period when he entered upon this\r\noffice he appears to have devoted himself exclusively to historical\r\nstudies. He died at an advanced age. His didactic works consist of\r\ntreatises (_discursos_) on various subjects of practical philosophy\r\nand literature. In one of these treatises, he expressly and urgently\r\nrecommends the rhetorical cultivation of the Spanish language, which\r\nthe writers of that age so unjustly disowned and neglected to the\r\ngreat prejudice of literature and even of philosophy.[313] The other\r\ndissertations of this meritorious writer, which are not so much known,\r\nrelate to the importance of rhetorical studies; the distinction between\r\nPlato’s and Aristotle’s methods of instruction; the duty of man to\r\nexert himself to the utmost when he wishes for the assistance of the\r\nAlmighty; the difference between a great and a good understanding; the\r\nvalue of wealth, independent of personal merit in the possessor; and\r\nsuch like objects of general utility. He only occasionally casts a side\r\nglance on the region of speculative philosophy, so that among Germans\r\nhe might with propriety be called the Spanish Garve. Like that author\r\nhis views were clear rather than profound; and like him also his object\r\nwas to write pure didactic prose. His style, though not energetic\r\nnor impressive, is natural, clear, and precise, and not unfrequently\r\nadorned with pleasing images.[314] The pedantic allusions to the\r\nscriptures and to classical literature must be attributed to the age\r\nand country to which Morales belonged.[315]\r\n\r\nPedro de Valles, another native of Cordova, followed the example of\r\nPerez de Oliva, in cultivating prose; but he inclined to the pomp and\r\nantitheses of Seneca, which he was perhaps induced to imitate from\r\nrespect for his countryman; for the learned of Cordova have always\r\nprided themselves in being natives of a city which had produced an\r\nancient author of so much celebrity. Morales, in his collection of his\r\nown and his uncle’s works, has inserted a treatise by Valles on the\r\nFear of Death.[316]\r\n\r\nFrancisco Cervantes de Salazar, who lived about the same period,\r\nlikewise followed the tract which had been marked out by Perez de\r\nOliva. Respecting the life of this writer but few particulars are\r\nknown; and the resemblance of his name to that of the celebrated\r\nCervantes Saavedra, does not appear to be a sufficient reason for\r\nconcluding that he was related to that distinguished author. Cervantes\r\nde Salazar wrote a continuation of Oliva’s Dialogue on the Dignity\r\nof Man; for he regarded it as unfinished, because Oliva allows the\r\nfriend and the enemy of human nature to deliver their opinions,\r\nwhile the third party, who is appointed the philosophic arbiter,\r\ndraws no inference from the arguments he hears. Through the medium\r\nof this third character, Salazar circumstantially recapitulates the\r\nwhole theme, and arrives at a decided conclusion. Salazar is a more\r\ncontemplative writer than Oliva, who, in other respects appears to\r\nhave been his model. He translated from the Greek the Tabla of Cebes,\r\nand from the Latin the _Introductio ad sapientiam_ of Luis Vives, one\r\nof the learned Spaniards who did not choose to write in their native\r\ntongue. He published his continuations and translations along with the\r\noriginal works.[317]\r\n\r\nAmong the various works which Cervantes de Salazar published and\r\nelucidated, is an allegorical romance, entitled “_Labricio_, or the\r\nfable (_Apologo_) of Idleness and Industry.” This romance may be placed\r\nif not among, at least beside didactic works, for the allegorical\r\nform serves merely to clothe the ideas, which are very methodically\r\ndeveloped. The author, Luis Mexia, or Messia, was a learned theologian\r\nand jurist. His object was to draw an interesting and animated picture\r\nof the dangers of idleness, the pleasures of occupation, and the value\r\nof well directed industry. Notwithstanding the faults inseparable from\r\nthe class of writing to which this work belongs, it presents the charm\r\nof an animated picture conveyed in language, which, though occasionally\r\ndeclamatory, is, upon the whole, pure and elegant.[318]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. HISTORICAL PROSE was, during this period, cultivated by\r\nno author in so high a degree as by Diego de Mendoza, whose history\r\nof the wars of Granada, has already been particularly mentioned; all\r\nthe other Spanish historians were inferior to Mendoza in every thing\r\nthat constitutes the historical art. But they had begun to study that\r\nart, in which they would no doubt have distinguished themselves, had\r\nthey not on the one hand been intimidated by the despotism of the\r\ngovernment, and on the other, influenced by a spirit of contradiction,\r\nwhich induced them to banish from genuine history every trace of\r\nimaginative colouring, lest they should be confounded with the romance\r\nwriters of the age.\r\n\r\nThe historical institution, established by Alphonso the Wise, still\r\nsubsisted; for the Spanish government was afraid to incur the shame of\r\nallowing it to perish. National historiographers or chroniclers were\r\naccordingly appointed, and paid in the same manner as formerly; but\r\nafter the accession of Charles V. those chroniclers could not venture\r\nto write with freedom, even in favour of the court party. Charles V.\r\nthought it prudent to obliterate as far as possible the recollection\r\nof the powerful opposition he had experienced on his succession to the\r\nSpanish crown. His chronicler, Florian de Ocampo, was a man of talent\r\nand information; and these qualifications soon enabled him to perceive\r\nthe necessity of protracting as much as possible the duty assigned to\r\nthe old Spanish chroniclers of writing the history of their own age.\r\nFortunately for him there existed at that period no ancient history of\r\nSpain; and this was a subject on which he could enter, without fear or\r\nconstraint, while, at the same time, it afforded scope for a singular\r\ndisplay of erudition. Ocampo accordingly wrote his five books of a\r\nGeneral Chronicle of Spain. By the selection of this deceiving title,\r\nOcampo appeared to be fulfilling the duties of his office; but the five\r\nbooks of his General Chronicle contain nothing more than the history\r\nof ancient Hispania, from the deluge to the second punic war.[319] The\r\nwork is not badly written, though it presents nothing particularly\r\nattractive either in the style or in the handling of the subject.\r\nOcampo selected his materials chiefly from the ancient authors, with\r\nwhom he must have been intimately acquainted; but as far as relates\r\nto historical art he avoided imitating his classical models, because,\r\nas he says, he was afraid to substitute for truth “the rhetorical\r\nflourishes and vanities, which appear in other books of the present\r\ntime.”[320] Like some German historians, he seems to have prided\r\nhimself in his dulness.\r\n\r\nThose truths which dared not be publicly told in the reign of Charles\r\nV. still remained secrets under the government of Philip II. But even\r\nthe latter monarch did not suffer the office of national chronicler to\r\nbe discontinued; and he nominated a particular historiographer for the\r\nprovinces of Castile, and another for those of Arragon. The learned\r\nAmbrosio de Morales, who took so lively an interest in the advancement\r\nof the rhetorical art, was, as has already been mentioned, appointed\r\nchronicler for the Castilian provinces. But with all his talent and\r\ninformation, Morales was not the man precisely calculated to occupy\r\nthis situation, had he wished strictly to discharge its duties. He\r\nhad little taste for politics, and modern history was not the branch\r\nof literature in the cultivation of which he was likely to find the\r\nemployment best suited to his talents. He therefore could do nothing\r\nwhich better accorded with his own inclination, and the circumstances\r\nin which he was placed, than to follow the footsteps of Ocampo, and\r\nto continue the ancient history of Spain from the second punic war to\r\nthe establishment of christianity.[321] He vied with his predecessor\r\nin research and erudition; while, at the same time, he devoted far\r\nmore attention to composition and style. In his preface, he states\r\nthat he availed himself of this opportunity of proving the dignity\r\nand majesty of the Spanish language; and in that respect he rose far\r\nsuperior to the usual chronicle style. In point of elegance, however,\r\nhe did not equal cardinal Bembo, while he really had no more idea than\r\nthat author, of the soul of the historical art, of which elegance is\r\nmerely an accessary.[322] Towards the close of his work, when he came\r\nto the christian ages, his zeal induced him to insert the lives of the\r\nsaints of Spanish origin; and certainly no writer before his time ever\r\ngave to that description of biography so much elegance and historical\r\ndignity. Indeed the simplicity to which Morales was always faithful, is\r\na remarkable feature in the works of an author who was so ambitious of\r\ndistinguishing himself by his style.\r\n\r\nThere appeared, however, at this time, another author, who might have\r\nbecome, if not the Livy, at least the Machiavell of Spain, had he been\r\nplaced in more favourable circumstances, and been disposed to devote\r\nhimself to the rhetorical cultivation of his talent for historical\r\ncomposition. He was a native of Arragon, and his name was Geronymo\r\nZurita, Surita or Curita, for it is written in these different ways.\r\nPhilip II. appointed him historiographer of the Arragonian provinces,\r\nan office which he was well qualified to fill. Like all educated\r\nArragonese, he wrote Castilian with as much facility as his mother\r\ntongue. As a politician, however, he entertained views respecting the\r\npractical application of history, which though clear and well founded,\r\nwere not likely to be very acceptable to a despotic sovereign. Zurita\r\nundertook, not merely the tedious task of exploring the old chronicles\r\nand records, to which he had access, in order to produce a complete\r\nhistory of the kingdom of Arragon, from the Moorish invasion to the\r\nreign of Charles V. he was moreover desirous that his historical\r\nlabour should exhibit a faithful view of the rise and formation of the\r\nnational constitution of Arragon. The modern historian, who may wish\r\nto investigate this particular point, ought to resort to the pages of\r\nZurita, for it will be difficult for him to find a more instructive\r\nauthor. Zurita gave to his historical work the title of Annals,[323]\r\nwhich he conceived to be more appropriate than that of chronicle. But\r\nhe felt the difficulty of the task he had undertaken, when he attempted\r\nto develope the republican principles of the Arragonian provinces, and\r\nat the same time to do homage to the caprice of an absolute monarch.\r\nHe must necessarily have written this part of his work in the total\r\nabsence of inspiration, for the only practical conclusion he draws\r\nfrom his researches is the trite maxim, “that subjects ought to be\r\ncontent if peace and tranquillity prevail in the country in which they\r\nlive;”[324] and it must be confessed that for peace and tranquillity,\r\nin a certain sense, Philip II. with the help of the Duke of Alba and\r\nthe inquisition, had sufficiently provided. But in order to judge how\r\nZurita would have written, had he been permitted to write freely, the\r\ngrounds of the decision must be collected only from detached passages\r\nof his work. His execution indeed is not so inviting as to excite\r\na strong desire for the perusal of the whole. He seems during his\r\nlaborious researches unconsciously to have imbibed the formal style\r\nof the chroniclers, their constantly recurring _and_ not excepted;\r\nwhile he did not allow himself time to separate the important from\r\nthe unimportant, and by a judicious distribution of his materials to\r\ncompose a pleasing historical picture. In a literary contest, which\r\narose respecting the merits and defects of these Annals of Arragon,\r\ntheir value, in a rhetorical point of view, was never taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ORATORICAL PROSE.--To other classes of prose writing,\r\nthe Spaniards at this time devoted but little attention; but two\r\nprinted discourses by Perez de Oliva well deserve to be more generally\r\nknown. The one was delivered at the request of a society of patriotic\r\ncitizens of Cordova, and it relates to the advantages to be derived\r\nfrom the navigation of the Guadalquivir. In the first part of this\r\ndiscourse, the learned orator certainly wanders far from his subject,\r\nfor he speaks of the Greeks and Romans, and even of the Trojan war;\r\nbut the second part contains a view of the business in hand, which\r\nis vigorously unfolded, full of sound sense, and divested of all\r\naffectation and pedantry. The second discourse promises but little,\r\nfor it is merely described as an academic occasional and defensive\r\naddress; but it contains a very good explanation of the literary duties\r\nof a professor of moral philosophy, together with some particulars\r\nrespecting the literary life of the author, which are related in an\r\nexcellent oratorical style.[325]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Of the EPISTOLARY PROSE of this age but few printed\r\nspecimens exist; and it may be presumed that the Spaniards could\r\nnot experience much pleasure in written correspondence, after their\r\nepistolary style had, like that of their social conversation, become\r\nsubject to the restraint of the ceremonial forms with which the\r\nItalians and the Germans were about the same time infected. With\r\nwhatever ease _vuessa merced_ (your grace or your worship) especially\r\nwhen contracted in conversation into _usté_, might glide, as a mere\r\nform of courtesy through Spanish lips, its frequent occurrence could\r\nnot fail to have a very embarrassing effect in the periods of familiar\r\nletters. This formula which every man of education employed in\r\naddressing his equals, exhibits a striking contrast to the higher\r\nceremonial style, which the king himself observed in corresponding with\r\nhis relatives. Among the Spanish epistolary documents of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, there has been preserved a letter from Philip II. to his\r\nnatural brother, Don John of Austria. This letter appears to be a kind\r\nof supplement, written by the king himself, to the commission by which\r\nDon John was appointed high admiral of the Spanish fleets (_capitan\r\ngeneral de la mar_). The king with old Spanish cordiality calls Don\r\nJohn, “brother,” (_hermano_), without any other title; and when he\r\naddresses him in the course of the letter, he uses the pronoun _you_,\r\nafter the old fashion. In reminding his natural brother of his duties,\r\nhe recommends to him integrity, as next in importance to religion.[326]\r\n\r\nThere is also preserved a letter from the Duke of Alba, of odious\r\ncelebrity, to Don John of Austria. It contains military instructions\r\nexpressed with precision and dignified simplicity; but the style is\r\nencumbered by the repetition of titles. Both letters are contained in\r\na collection published by the diligent Gregorio Mayans y Siscar.[327]\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH CRITICISM DURING THE PERIOD OF THIS SECTION.\r\n\r\nIt would scarcely be worth while to say any thing relative to Spanish\r\ncriticism during the period this section embraces, were it not that\r\namong the books of instruction on poetry and rhetoric which then\r\nappeared, there was one, which besides being extraordinary for the\r\nage in which it was produced, may be regarded as the first of its\r\nkind in modern literature. It is entitled, the Philosophy of the\r\nAncient Style of Poetry, which in Spanish is somewhat fantastically\r\nexpressed, _Philosophia Antigua Poetica_. This work is the production\r\nof Alonzo Lopez Pinciano, physician to Charles V. who as has been\r\nmentioned, was likewise the author of an unsuccessful heroic poem.[328]\r\nThough Pinciano possessed few qualifications for a poet, he had\r\nnevertheless conceived the idea of writing an Art of Poetry, which\r\nshould be something more than a mere introduction to versification\r\nand instructions relative to correct and figurative expression.\r\nSpeculations on the elements of poetry constituted his chief\r\noccupation, when relieved from the duties of his profession. He had\r\nso carefully studied Aristotle’s Art of Poetry, and so attentively\r\ncompared it with the other writings of the same author, that of all\r\nthe admirers of that work, he was probably the first who discovered\r\nits imperfection. He says--“what is called Aristotle’s Art of Poetry\r\ncannot, if rightly understood, be regarded in any other light than as\r\na fragment; for Aristotle, in various passages of his other works,\r\nrefers to a second part of this Art of Poetry, which is lost.”\r\nPinciano’s conjectures respecting the contents of the lost part, and\r\nits connection with the fragment now existing, have, it is true,\r\nbeen contradicted by more modern critics; but this physician was\r\nnevertheless the first to observe that imperfection which had escaped\r\nthe notice of all previous philologists and commentators on Aristotle.\r\nHe remarks, that the philologists and commentators have written very\r\nlearned works; which, however, are as imperfect as the text which they\r\nelucidate. With the view of restoring poetry to its ancient dignity,\r\nand establishing and developing its true spirit, Lopez Pinciano\r\ncommences with an Analysis of the Wants of Human Nature. He treats\r\nminutely of the senses, of the affections, the faculties of the soul,\r\nwisdom, and the pleasures peculiar to cultivated minds, but always\r\nwith reference to the works of Aristotle, whom, like other writers\r\nof that age, he merely designates by the title of the _philosopher_.\r\nLike Aristotle, he makes imitation the essence of poetry; but with\r\na particular and more precise definition of what in his opinion\r\nconstitutes poetic imitation. He then enters upon reflections\r\nconcerning poetic language, and gives a detailed theory of the several\r\nkinds of poetry. The present, however, is not the proper place to\r\npresent an explanation of this theory. Whenever Lopez Pinciano abandons\r\nAristotle, his notions respecting the different poetic styles are as\r\nconfused as those of his contemporaries; and only a few of his notions\r\nand distinctions can be deemed of importance at the present day. But\r\nhis name is deserving of honourable remembrance, for he was the first\r\nwriter of modern times who endeavoured to establish a philosophic\r\nart of poetry; and with all his veneration for Aristotle, he was the\r\nfirst scholar who ventured to think for himself, and to go somewhat\r\nfurther than his master. He also evinced a laudable perseverance in\r\nthe execution of his task. Pinciano’s learned and ingenious work was\r\nnot quite so useful as it might have been, owing in a great measure to\r\nits artificial and formal manner of composition, which, however, the\r\nauthor considered singularly easy and natural. This Art of Poetry is\r\nwritten in the form of letters, (which was in itself a novelty at that\r\nage), and in these letters, conversations are occasionally introduced.\r\nThe friend who answers, invariably gives an abstract of the letter he\r\nhas last received, as a proof that he understands its contents and its\r\nobject. Lopez Pinciano, however, cannot be regarded as a model in\r\nepistolary and conversational prose any more than in poetry.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the other arts of poetry which appeared about this time\r\nin the Spanish language, merely confined themselves to the explanation\r\nof metrical forms and the establishment of subordinate principles.\r\nAmong these authors were Sanchez de Viena, Geronymo de Mondragon, and\r\nJuan Diaz.[329] An Art of Poetry of the same description in verse,\r\nby Juan de la Cueva, has already been mentioned. From a philosophic\r\ntreatise of this kind, Spanish poetry could derive no advantage,\r\nunless its origin had been totally different from what it really was.\r\nTheories, even the most popular, can contribute only in a very slight\r\ndegree to the formation of the poetic genius, either of nations or\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nSeveral works on the art of rhetoric, in which the principles of\r\nAristotle were followed, appeared about this time in Spain; but they\r\nproduced nothing valuable with respect to theory, and exercised no\r\nremarkable influence on the improvement of Spanish prose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND SECTION.\r\n\r\n    _History of Spanish Poetry and Eloquence, from the Age of\r\n    Cervantes and Lope de Vega to the Middle of the Seventeenth\r\n    Century._\r\n\r\n\r\nSpanish literature had now assumed a new character. Classical poets\r\nwrote in the Castilian language; and elegant prose was cultivated with\r\nequal rapidity and success on the model of the ancients. No great\r\nadvantage could henceforth be derived from the imitation of the Italian\r\npoets, for the genius of the Spanish nation had well nigh decided how\r\nfar and under what limitations the Italian poetry could be naturalized\r\nin Spain. But laurels were yet to be gathered on the new Parnassus;\r\nand the conflict between the ancient and modern styles, had, through\r\nthe disputes of the different parties, who sought to rule the Spanish\r\ndrama, at length arrived at a crisis. Under these circumstances,\r\nCervantes and Lope de Vega entered upon the career which their\r\npredecessors had opened for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCERVANTES.\r\n\r\nThe life of this extraordinary man, whom, for the space of two\r\ncenturies, civilized Europe has admired above every other Spanish\r\nwriter, has been so frequently related, that a brief abstract of his\r\nbiography, derived from the most authentic sources, will be sufficient\r\nfor the purpose of this history.[330]\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact, that the contemporaries of this celebrated man,\r\nwhom every town, not merely in Spain, but throughout the world, would\r\nbe proud to have produced, should have neglected to record his native\r\nplace. After long investigations and warm disputes, which call to\r\nmind the contests of the seven Greek towns, for the honour of having\r\ngiven birth to Homer, it is at length agreed that the greatest share\r\nof probability belongs to the conjecture, according to which Miguel de\r\nCervantes Saavedra was born at Alcalà de Henàres in the year 1547. His\r\nparents, who were not rich, were merely enabled to give him a moderate,\r\nbut at the same time a literary education. They sent him to the schools\r\nof Madrid, where he acquired some knowledge of classical learning.\r\nAt Madrid he had an opportunity of witnessing the dramas which the\r\ningenious Lope de Rueda represented on his wretched stage. Juan\r\nLopez, the tutor of Cervantes, was an indefatigable writer of poetry,\r\nparticularly of romances, and he sought every means of cherishing his\r\npupils’ taste for poetic composition. Some verses by Cervantes were\r\nintroduced in a description of the funeral of a Spanish princess, which\r\nLopez published in 1569.\r\n\r\nBut young Cervantes, who had now attained his twenty-second year,\r\nseems to have had no certain means of gaining a subsistence. He wrote\r\nnumerous romances and sonnets; and it was probably about this period\r\nthat he composed a pastoral romance, entitled _Filena_, which, if we\r\nmay give credit to his own testimony, was very generally read.[331] It\r\nappears that he thought he could better his condition by travelling;\r\nand he resolved to proceed to Italy. Here commences the period of his\r\nadventures. In Rome, cardinal Acquaviva for a short time became his\r\npatron and protector. But impelled either by necessity or choice, he\r\nentered into the military profession. He enlisted under the banners\r\nof his sovereign, to serve in the wars against the Turks and African\r\ncorsairs, who at that time disturbed the tranquillity of Spain and\r\nItaly. During the war he proved himself to be wholly devoted to his\r\nnew profession; but being engaged in the great battle of Lepanto, in\r\n1572, he received a wound which deprived him of his left hand together\r\nwith a part of the arm. This honourable mutilation, to which he proudly\r\nalludes in his latter writings, obliged him to return to Spain. The\r\nship, however, in which he had embarked, was captured by an Algerine\r\ncorsair, and Cervantes was conveyed to Algiers and sold for a slave.\r\nHis captivity which lasted for nearly eight years, must have been of\r\nthe most romantic description, if the fact be, as has frequently been\r\nconjectured, that Cervantes described his own adventures in the novel\r\nof the Captive.[332] He was at length ransomed, and in the year 1581 he\r\nreturned to his native country.\r\n\r\nThe third period of the life of Cervantes was exclusively devoted\r\nto literature. He had now attained his thirty-second year, and with\r\na matured understanding, joined to considerable practical knowledge\r\nof the world, and an ardent passion for literature, he resolved to\r\nwithdraw from the busy scene of life. In his retirement he wrote his\r\nsecond pastoral romance, entitled _Galatea_, which has so eclipsed\r\nFilena, that the latter is quite neglected and forgotten. He shortly\r\nafterwards married, and in all probability lived for some time on his\r\nwife’s dowry. At length he began to write for the stage; but the dramas\r\nwhich he composed at this period of his life, though about thirty in\r\nnumber, are nearly all lost.[333]--About this time arose the rivalry\r\nbetween Cervantes and Lope de Vega, whose dramas were so much admired\r\nthat they bore away the palm of public favour. Mortified, as it would\r\nappear, by the ill success of his dramatic efforts, Cervantes laid\r\naside his pen for a considerable period. It is conjectured, that in\r\nthe meanwhile he obtained a post in Seville, the emoluments of which\r\nenabled him to subsist. He did not again appear in the literary world\r\nuntil the death of Philip II. in the year 1598.\r\n\r\nIt can scarcely be doubted, though no Spanish writer has made the\r\nconjecture, that the death of Philip II. had a favourable influence\r\non the genius of Cervantes. After the accession of the indolent\r\nPhilip III. every man in Spain felt that he might then have more\r\nfreedom than he dared to take during the gloomy intolerance of the\r\npreceding reign. The Spaniards now ventured to sport with the chains\r\nwhich they had not the power to break, and delicate satire was soon\r\nfreely employed. Cervantes quickly found a subject for ridicule, in an\r\noutrageous contest which arose in Seville between the spiritual and\r\nmunicipal authorities, concerning the funeral obsequies of the deceased\r\nmonarch. There is reason to believe that he composed, about the same\r\nperiod, some of the Instructive Novels (_Novelas Exemplares_), which\r\nhe subsequently published. What accident gave rise to the idea of his\r\nDon Quixote is unknown; for his having, while travelling through the\r\nprovince of la Mancha, become engaged in disputes with some of the\r\ninhabitants, and his being on that account for a short time imprisoned,\r\ncan at most be only supposed to have suggested the idea of making that\r\nprovince the scene of the first part of his romance. Some fortunate\r\ncircumstance, which cannot now be traced, seems to have impressed\r\nCervantes, who was then in his fiftieth year, with the consciousness of\r\nthe true bent of his genius. The commencement of Don Quixote was first\r\npublished at Madrid, in 1606; but the enthusiastic reception which this\r\noriginal romance experienced from the Spanish public, produced very\r\nlittle change in the author’s fortune; for the folly which felt itself\r\ndisturbed in its security united with envy in seeking to discover the\r\nmost offensive allusions in the work. Cervantes accordingly continued\r\npoor, and had now to contend with exasperated enemies, who imagined\r\nthey had completely defeated him, when an unknown writer of their own\r\nparty, under the name of Avellaneda, published a continuation of Don\r\nQuixote, full of invective against the original author. Precisely at\r\nthe period when this continuation appeared, Cervantes published the\r\nsequel of his Instructive Novels, which he dedicated to the Count of\r\nLemos. In that nobleman he found a protector who never withdrew his\r\nfavour, and who, as it appears, afforded him support in various ways.\r\nPecuniary necessity seems, however, to have urged him, as a last\r\nresource, to write for the stage.\r\n\r\nThe latest works of Cervantes, were the genuine continuation and\r\ncompletion of Don Quixote, the Journey to Parnassus, which was first\r\npublished in 1614, and finally the romance of Persiles and Sigismunda,\r\nfor which, a few days previous to his death, he wrote a dedication\r\nto the Count of Lemos. From various passages in the prefaces and\r\nintroductions to these last works, it is obvious how highly Cervantes\r\nprized that celebrity which, after many abortive efforts, he had at\r\nlength obtained in his old age. But even where his vanity is not\r\ndisguised, it is easy, from the candid tone in which he speaks of\r\nhimself, to recognize the man of firm and upright spirit, the declared\r\nenemy of every sort of affectation, and the honest and liberal judge\r\nof himself and others. He died in poverty, though not in extreme want,\r\nat Madrid, in 1616, in the sixty-ninth year of his age. He was buried\r\nprivately, without any kind of distinction, and not even a common\r\ntomb-stone marks the spot where the ashes of Cervantes repose.\r\n\r\nWere we to arrange the works of Cervantes according to their merits,\r\nthe first place must be assigned to Don Quixote, which is moreover\r\nentitled to the supremacy, inasmuch as it is single in its kind.\r\n\r\nTo enter into a description of the contents of this universally known\r\nmaster-piece, or to give a circumstantial analysis of its plan,\r\nwould be equally superfluous. A few words, however, on the happy and\r\noriginal idea which forms the foundation of the whole work may here be\r\nintroduced. It has often been said, though the opinion has, perhaps,\r\nnot been fully weighed, nor even expressed with sufficient precision,\r\nthat the venerable knight of La Mancha is the immortal representative\r\nof all men of exalted imagination, who carry the noblest enthusiasm to\r\na pitch of folly; because with understandings in other respects sound,\r\nthey are unable to resist the fascinating power of a self-deception,\r\nby which they are induced to regard themselves as beings of a superior\r\norder. None but an experienced observer of mankind, endowed with\r\nprofound judgment, and a genius to the penetrating glance of which one\r\nof the most interesting recesses of the human heart had been newly\r\ndisclosed, could have seized the idea of such a romance with energetic\r\ndecision. None but a poet and a man of wit could have thrown so much\r\npoetic interest into the execution of that idea; and none but an author\r\nwho had at his disposal all the richness and variety of one of the\r\nfinest languages in the world, could have diffused over such a work\r\nthat classical perfection of expression, which gives the stamp of\r\nexcellence to the whole. The originality of the idea of Don Quixote is\r\nnot only historically demonstrated, by no romance of a similar kind\r\nhaving previously existed--for pictures of ingenious roguery in the\r\nstyle of Lazarillo de Tormes, belong to a totally different species of\r\ncomic romance--but it is also physiologically certain, that a creative\r\nfancy, which was only capable of continuing to invent where another had\r\nstopt, could not, with the boldness of Cervantes, have combined traits,\r\napparently heterogeneous, in order thereby to exhaust to the utmost\r\nthe idea by which he was inspired. Those who are acquainted with Don\r\nQuixote only through the medium of the common translations, will not\r\ncertainly be inclined to regard it as a work of inspiration, in the\r\nhighest sense of the word. But it is impossible to form a more mistaken\r\nnotion of this work, than to consider it merely as a satire, intended\r\nby the author to ridicule the absurd passion for reading old romances\r\nof chivalry. Doubtless this is one of the objects which Cervantes had\r\nin view; for among the romances which the Spanish public indefatigably\r\nperused, few were tolerable, and only one or two possessed first-rate\r\nmerit. We must not, however, attribute to him the absurd conceit of\r\nwishing to prove the prejudicial influence, which the reading of bad\r\nromances produced on the taste of the Spanish nation, by exhibiting\r\nthe individual folly of an enthusiast, who would have been just as\r\nlikely to have lost his senses by the study of Plato or Aristotle, as\r\nby the reading of romances of chivalry. The merit and the richness\r\nof the idea of a man of elevated character, excited by heroic and\r\nenthusiastic feelings to the extravagant pitch of wishing to restore\r\nthe age of chivalry, must be regarded as the seed of inspiration\r\nwhence the whole work originated. As a poet, Cervantes was aware of\r\nthe resources which this idea furnished; and he must also have been\r\nsatisfied with his power to prosecute it, as he has proved in the\r\nexecution what he was capable of accomplishing. In the invention of a\r\nseries of comic situations in the most burlesque style, he found full\r\nscope for the exercise of his fancy. The painting of these situations\r\nafforded opportunities for the free and energetic developement of his\r\npoetic talent. Finally, he knew how to combine the knowledge of human\r\nnature, which he had acquired during a life of fifty years, with the\r\nmost delicate satire, so as to render his comic romance also a book of\r\nmoral instruction, to which no parallel existed. These brief remarks\r\non the idea which forms the foundation of the romance of Don Quixote,\r\nmust be allowed to supply the place of a detailed analysis of the\r\nmanner in which that celebrated work is composed. Other critics have\r\nsufficiently proved that the composition is by no means faultless.\r\nIn the preface to the second part, Cervantes has himself pointed out\r\nsome inadvertences which produce incongruities in the history, but he\r\ndisdained to correct them, because he conceived that they had been too\r\nseverely condemned.\r\n\r\nThe character of the execution of this comic romance, is no less\r\noriginal than the invention. Character in the strictest sense of the\r\nterm is here meant. The superficial sketches of a sportive fancy, for\r\nwhich the Spaniards in the age of Cervantes entertained so high a\r\npredilection, had not sufficient interest for him. He felt a passion\r\nfor the vivid painting of character, as all his successful works\r\nprove. Under the influence of this feeling, he not only drew the\r\nnatural and striking portrait of his heroic Don Quixote, so truly\r\nnoble-minded, and so enthusiastic an admirer of every thing good and\r\ngreat, yet having all those fine qualities, accidentally blended\r\nwith a relative kind of madness; but he likewise pourtrayed, with no\r\nless fidelity, the opposite character of Sancho Panza, a compound of\r\ngrossness and simplicity, whose low selfishness leads him to place\r\nblind confidence in all the extravagant hopes and promises of his\r\nmaster. The subordinate characters of the great picture exhibit equal\r\ntruth and decision: but the characteristic tone of the whole is still\r\nmore remarkable. A translator cannot commit a more serious injury to\r\nDon Quixote, than to dress that work in a light anecdotical style. A\r\nstyle perfectly unostentatious and free from affectation, but at the\r\nsame time solemn, and penetrated, as it were, with the character of the\r\nhero, diffuses over this comic romance an imposing air, which, were it\r\nnot so appropriate, would seem to belong exclusively to serious works,\r\nand which is certainly difficult to be seized in a translation. But it\r\nis precisely this solemnity of language, which imparts a characteristic\r\nrelief to the comic scenes. It is the genuine style of the old romances\r\nof chivalry, improved and applied in a totally original way; and only\r\nwhere the dialogue style occurs is each person found to speak, as he\r\nmight be expected to do, and in his own peculiar manner. But wherever\r\nDon Quixote himself harangues, the language re-assumes the venerable\r\ntone of the romance style;[334] and various uncommon expressions of\r\nwhich the hero avails himself, serve to complete the delusion of\r\nhis covetous squire, to whom they are only half intelligible.[335]\r\nThis characteristic tone diffuses over the whole a poetic colouring,\r\nwhich distinguishes Don Quixote from all comic romances in the\r\nordinary style; and that poetic colouring is moreover heightened by\r\nthe judicious choice of episodes. The essential connection of these\r\nepisodes with the whole has sometimes escaped the observation of\r\ncritics, who have regarded, as merely parenthetical, those parts in\r\nwhich Cervantes has most decidedly manifested the poetic spirit of\r\nhis work. The novel of _El Curioso Impertinente_, cannot indeed be\r\nranked among the number of these essential episodes; but the charming\r\nstory of the shepherdess Marcella, the history of Dorothea, and the\r\nhistory of the rich Camacho and the poor Basilio, are unquestionably\r\nconnected with the interest of the whole. These serious romantic parts,\r\nwhich are not, it is true, essential to the historical connection, but\r\nstrictly belong to the characteristic dignity of the whole picture,\r\nalso prove how far Cervantes was from the idea usually attributed to\r\nhim of writing a book merely to excite laughter. The passages which\r\ncommon readers feel inclined to pass over, are, in general, precisely\r\nthose in which Cervantes has shewn himself more a poet, and for which\r\nhe has manifested an evident predilection. On such occasions he also\r\nintroduces among his prose, episodical verses, which are for the most\r\npart excellent in their kind, and which no translator can omit without\r\ndoing violence to the spirit of the original.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the happy art with which Cervantes has contrived to\r\npreserve an intermediate tone between pure poetry and prose, Don\r\nQuixote would not deserve to be cited as the first classic model of\r\nthe modern romance or novel. It is, however, fully entitled to that\r\ndistinction. Cervantes was the first writer who formed the genuine\r\nromance of modern times on the model of the original chivalrous\r\nromance, that equivocal creation of the genius and the barbarous\r\ntaste of the middle ages. The result has proved that modern taste,\r\nhowever readily it may in other respects conform to the rules of the\r\nantique, nevertheless requires in the narration of fictitious events,\r\na certain union of poetry with prose which was unknown to the Greeks\r\nand Romans in their best literary ages. It was only necessary to\r\nseize on the right tone, but that was a point of delicacy which the\r\ninventors of romances of chivalry were not able to comprehend. Diego\r\nde Mendoza, in his Lazarillo de Tormes, departed too far from poetry.\r\nCervantes, in his Don Quixote, restored to the poetic art the place\r\nit was entitled to hold in this class of writing: and he must not\r\nbe blamed if cultivated nations have subsequently mistaken the true\r\nspirit of his work, because their own novelists had led them to regard\r\ncommon prose as the style peculiarly suited to romance composition.\r\nDon Quixote is moreover the undoubted prototype of the comic novel.\r\nThe humorous situations are, it is true, almost all burlesque, which\r\nwas certainly not necessary, but the satire is frequently so delicate,\r\nthat it escapes rather than obtrudes on unpractised attention; as for\r\nexample in the whole picture of the administration of Sancho Panza in\r\nhis imaginary island. Besides, the language even in the description\r\nof the most burlesque situations, never degenerates into vulgarity.\r\nThroughout the whole work it is in general noble, correct, and so\r\nhighly polished, that it would not disgrace even an ancient classic\r\nof the first rank.[336] This explanation of a part of the merits of\r\na work, which has been so often wrongly judged, may, perhaps, seem to\r\nbelong rather to the eulogist than the calm and impartial historian.\r\nLet those who may be inclined to form this opinion, study Don Quixote\r\nin the original language, and study it rightly, for it is not a book\r\nto be judged by a superficial perusal. But care must be taken that the\r\nintervention of many subordinate traits, which were intended to have\r\nonly a transient national interest, does not produce an error in the\r\nestimate of the whole.\r\n\r\nIt would be scarcely possible to arrange the other works of Cervantes\r\naccording to a critical judgment of their importance; for the merits\r\nof some consist in the admirable finish of the whole, while others\r\nexhibit the impress of genius in the invention, or some other\r\nindividual feature. A distinguished place must, however, be assigned\r\nto the _Novelas Exemplares_ (Moral or Instructive Tales.) They are\r\nunequal in merit as well as in character. Cervantes, doubtless,\r\nintended that they should be to the Spaniards nearly what the novels\r\nof Boccacio were to the Italians: some are mere anecdotes, some are\r\nromances in miniature, some are serious, some comic, and all are\r\nwritten in a light, smooth, conversational style. With regard to the\r\npractical knowledge which these novels are intended to convey to the\r\nreader, Cervantes has effected more than Boccacio; and at all events\r\nhe extended the literature of his country by their publication, for no\r\nsimilar compositions had previously existed in the Spanish language.\r\nIn them Cervantes has again proved himself the experienced judge of\r\nmankind, and has given, with admirable success, truly genuine and\r\njudicious representations of nature, in the various situations of real\r\nlife. The reader must naturally feel inclined to pardon the want of\r\nplan which this little collection of novels occasionally exhibits,\r\nwhen he finds that the author through the medium of his characters\r\nrelates and describes all that he had himself seen and experienced\r\nunder similar circumstances, particularly during his abode in Italy\r\nand Africa. The history of the _Licenciado Vidriera_, (the Glass\r\nLicentiate) which is the fifth in the collection, is totally destitute\r\nof plan, and is related in simple prose like a common anecdote. But the\r\nnovel of _La Gitanilla_, (the Gipsey Girl) is ingeniously conceived and\r\npoetically coloured; and the same may be said of some others. The story\r\nof _Rinconete y Cortadilla_, or the Lurker and the Cutter, as the names\r\nwith reference to their etymology may be translated,[337] is a comic\r\nromance in miniature.\r\n\r\n_Galatea_, the pastoral romance which Cervantes wrote in his youth, is\r\na happy imitation of the Diana of Montemayor, but exhibiting a still\r\ncloser resemblance to Gil Polo’s continuation of that poem.[338] Next\r\nto Don Quixote and the _Novelas Exemplares_, this pastoral romance is\r\nparticularly worthy of attention, as it manifests in a striking way\r\nthe poetic direction in which the genius of Cervantes moved even at\r\nan early period of life, and from which he never entirely departed in\r\nhis subsequent writings. As, however, the Galatea possesses but little\r\noriginality, it constantly excites the recollection of its models, and\r\nparticularly of the Diana of Gil Polo. Of the invention of the fable\r\nlikewise, but little can be said, for though the story is continued\r\nthrough six books, it is still incomplete. In composing this pastoral\r\nromance, Cervantes seems to have had no other object than to clothe\r\nin the popular garb of a tale, a rich collection of poems in the old\r\nSpanish and Italian styles, which he could not have presented to the\r\npublic under a more agreeable form. The story is merely the thread\r\nwhich holds the beautiful garland together; for the poems are the\r\nportion of the work most particularly deserving attention. They are\r\nas numerous as they are various: and should the title of Cervantes\r\nto rank, with respect to verse as well as to prose, among the most\r\neminent poets, or his originality in versified composition, be called\r\nin question, an attentive perusal of the romance of Galatea must banish\r\nevery doubt on these points. It was remarked by the contemporaries of\r\nCervantes that he was incapable of writing poetry, and that he could\r\ncompose only beautiful prose; but that observation had reference solely\r\nto his dramatic works. Every critic, sufficiently acquainted with his\r\nlyrical compositions, has rendered justice to their merits. From the\r\nromance of Galatea it is obvious that Cervantes composed in all the\r\nvarious kinds of syllabic measure which were used in his time. He even\r\noccasionally adopted the old dactylic stanza.[339] He appears to have\r\nexperienced some difficulty in the metrical form of the sonnet, and\r\nhis essays in that style are by no means numerous;[340] but his poems\r\nin Italian octaves display the utmost facility; and among the number,\r\nthe song of Calliope in the last book of the Galatea is remarkable for\r\nthe graceful ease of the versification.[341] In the same manner as\r\nGil Polo in his Diana makes the river Turia pronounce the praises of\r\nthe celebrated Valencians, the poetic fancy of Cervantes summoned the\r\nmuse Calliope before the shepherds and shepherdesses, to render solemn\r\nhomage to those contemporaries whom he esteemed worthy of distinction\r\nas poets. But the critic can scarcely venture to place reliance on\r\npraises which are dealt out with such profuse liberality. The most\r\nbeautiful poems in the Galatea are a few in the cancion style, some\r\nof which are in iambics,[342] and some in trochaic or old Spanish\r\nverse.[343] Cervantes has here and there indulged in those antiquated\r\nand fantastic plays of wit, which at a subsequent period he himself\r\nridiculed.[344] The prose of the Galatea, which is in other respects so\r\nbeautiful, is also occasionally overloaded with a sort of epithetical\r\nostentation.[345]\r\n\r\nCervantes displays a totally different kind of poetic talent in\r\nthe _Viage al Parnaso_, (Journey to Parnassus) a work which cannot\r\nproperly be ranked in any particular class of literary composition, but\r\nwhich, next to Don Quixote, is the most exquisite production of its\r\nextraordinary author. The chief object of the poem is to satirize the\r\nfalse pretenders to the honours of the Spanish Parnassus, who lived\r\nin the age of the author. But this satire is of a peculiar character:\r\nit is a most happy effusion of sportive humour, and it yet remains a\r\nmatter of doubt whether Cervantes intended to praise or to ridicule\r\nthe individuals whom he points out as being particularly worthy of the\r\nfavour of Apollo. He himself says--“Those whose names do not appear\r\nin this list, may be just as well pleased as those who are mentioned\r\nin it.” To characterize true poetry according to his own poetic\r\nfeelings; to manifest in a decided way his enthusiasm for the art even\r\nin his old age; and to hold up a mirror for the conviction of those\r\nwho were only capable of making rhymes and inventing extravagances,\r\nseem to have been the objects which Cervantes had principally in view\r\nwhen he composed this satirical poem. Concealed satire, open jesting,\r\nand ardent enthusiasm for the beautiful, are the boldly combined\r\nelements of this noble work. It is divided into eight chapters, and\r\nthe versification is in tercets. The composition is half comic and\r\nhalf serious. After many humorous incidents, Mercury appears to\r\nCervantes, who is represented as travelling to Parnassus in the most\r\nmiserable condition; and the god salutes him with the title of the\r\n“Adam of poets.”[346] Mercury after addressing to him many flattering\r\ncompliments, conducts him to a ship entirely built of different kinds\r\nof verse, and which is intended to convey a cargo of Spanish poets to\r\nthe kingdom of Apollo. The description of the ship is an admirable\r\ncomic allegory.[347] Mercury shews him a list of the poets with\r\nwhom Apollo wishes to become acquainted; and this list, owing to the\r\nproblematic nature of its half ironical and half serious praises, has\r\nproved a stumbling block to commentators. In the midst of the reading\r\nCervantes suddenly drops the list. The poets are now described as\r\ncrowding on board the ship in numbers as countless as drops of rain in\r\na shower, or grains of sand on the sea coast; and such a tumult ensues,\r\nthat to save the ship from sinking by their pressure, the sirens raise\r\na furious storm. The flights of imagination become more wild as the\r\nstory advances. The storm subsides, and is succeeded by a shower of\r\npoets, that is to say, poets fall from the clouds. One of the first\r\nwho descends on the ship is Lope de Vega, on whom Cervantes seizes\r\nthis opportunity of pronouncing a pompous eulogium. The remainder of\r\nthe poem, a complete analysis of which would occupy too much space,\r\nproceeds in the same spirit. One of the most beautiful pieces of verse\r\never written by Cervantes, is his description of the goddess Poesy,\r\nwhom he sees in all her glory in the kingdom of Apollo.[348] To this\r\nfine picture the portrait of the goddess Vain-Glory, who afterwards\r\nappears to the author in a dream, forms an excellent companion.[349]\r\nAmong the passages which for burlesque humour vie with Don Quixote is\r\nthe description of a second storm, in which Neptune vainly endeavours\r\nto plunge the poetasters to the bottom of the deep. Venus prevents\r\nthem from sinking, by changing them into empty gourds and leather\r\nbottles.[350] At length a formal battle is fought between the real\r\npoets and some of the poetasters. The poem is throughout interspersed\r\nwith singularly witty and beautiful ideas; and only a very few passages\r\ncan be charged with feebleness or langour. It has never been equalled,\r\nfar less surpassed by any similar work, and it had no prototype. The\r\nlanguage is classical throughout; and it is only to be regretted, that\r\nCervantes has added to the poem a comic supplement in prose, in which\r\nhe indulges a little too freely in self-praise.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic compositions of Cervantes, were they all extant, would\r\nbe the most voluminous, though, certainly, not the best portion of\r\nhis works. Perhaps those which are now lost may yet be recovered;\r\nfor a fortunate accident brought to light two dramas, which had\r\nremained concealed in manuscript till near the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.[351] Cervantes includes some of his dramas among those\r\nproductions with which he was himself most satisfied; and he seems to\r\nhave regarded them with the greater self-complacency in proportion\r\nas they experienced the neglect of the public.[352] This conduct has\r\nsometimes been attributed to a spirit of contradiction, and sometimes\r\nto vanity. The editor of the eight plays (chiefly heroic) and eight\r\ninterludes, which were the last dramatic productions of Cervantes, has\r\nadopted the absurd notion, that Cervantes in writing these pieces,\r\nintended to parody and ridicule the style of Lope de Vega;[353] which\r\nis merely saying that he attacked the whole literary public of\r\nSpain in the most discourteous way. No traces of parody appear in\r\nany of those dramas. They are, however, with the exception of a few\r\nsuccessful scenes, so dull and tedious, that one might be inclined to\r\nregard them as counterfeit productions by another author, were it not\r\nthat their authenticity seems to be sufficiently proved. The little\r\ninterludes alone exhibit burlesque humour and dramatic spirit. That\r\nthe penetrating and profound Cervantes should have so mistaken the\r\nlimits of his dramatic talent, would not be sufficiently accounted for\r\neven by his vanity, had he not unquestionably proved by his tragedy\r\nof Numantia how pardonable was the self-deception of which he could\r\nnot divest himself. Cervantes was entitled to consider himself endowed\r\nwith a genius for dramatic poetry. But he could not preserve his\r\nindependence in the conflict he had to maintain with the conditions\r\nrequired by the Spanish public in dramatic composition; and when he\r\nsacrificed his independence, and submitted to rules imposed by others,\r\nhis invention and language were reduced to the level of a poet of\r\ninferior talent. The intrigues, adventures, and surprises which in that\r\nage characterized the Spanish drama, were ill suited to the genius\r\nof Cervantes. His natural style was too profound and precise to be\r\nreconciled to fantastical ideas, expressed in irregular verse. But he\r\nwas Spaniard enough to be gratified with dramas, which, as a poet, he\r\ncould not imitate; and he imagined himself capable of imitating them,\r\nbecause he would have shone in another species of dramatic composition,\r\nhad the public taste accommodated itself to his genius.\r\n\r\nWith all its imperfections and faults, Cervantes’s tragedy of Numantia\r\nis a noble production, and, like Don Quixote, it is unparalleled in the\r\nclass of literature to which it belongs. It proves that under different\r\ncircumstances the author of Don Quixote might have been the Æschylus of\r\nSpain. The conception is in the style of the boldest pathos, and the\r\nexecution, at least taken as a whole, is vigorous and dignified. The\r\nancient Roman History from which Cervantes selected the story of the\r\ndestruction of Numantia, afforded but few positive facts of which he\r\ncould avail himself in his heroic tragedy. He therefore invented along\r\nwith the subject of his piece a peculiar style of tragic composition,\r\nin doing which he did not pay much regard to the theory of Aristotle.\r\nHis object was to produce a piece full of tragic situations, combined\r\nwith the charm of the marvellous. The tragedy is written in conformity\r\nwith no rules save those which Cervantes prescribed to himself;\r\nfor he felt no inclination to imitate the Greek forms. The play is\r\ndivided into four acts (_jornadas_), and no chorus is introduced. The\r\ndialogue is sometimes in tercets, and sometimes in redondillas, and\r\nfor the most part in octaves, without any regard to rule. The diction\r\ndoes not maintain equal dignity throughout; but it is in no instance\r\naffected or bombastic. Cervantes has evinced admirable skill in\r\ngradually heightening the tragic interest to the close of the piece.\r\nThe commencement is, however, somewhat cold and tedious. Scipio appears\r\nwith his generals in the Roman camp before Numantia. In a speech which\r\nmight have been improved by abridgment, he reprimands his troops,\r\nwhose spirit has begun to give way to effeminacy. The soldiers are\r\nre-inspired with courage. Numantian ambassadors enter with proposals\r\nfor peace, which are rejected. It is here that the tragedy properly\r\nbegins. Spain appears as an allegorical character, and she summons the\r\nriver Duero, or Durius, on whose banks Numantia stands. The old river\r\ngod appears, attended by a retinue of the deities of the smaller rivers\r\nof the surrounding country. These ideal characters consult the book of\r\nfate, and discover that Numantia cannot be saved. Whatever may be said\r\nagainst the bold idea of endeavouring to augment the tragic pathos by\r\nmeans of allegorical characters, it must be acknowledged that in this\r\ncase the result of the experiment is not altogether unsuccessful, and\r\nCervantes justly prides himself in the novelty of the idea. The scene\r\nis now transferred to Numantia. The senate is assembled to deliberate\r\non the affairs of the city, and among the members the character of\r\nTheagenes shines with conspicuous lustre. Bold resolutions are adopted\r\nby the senate. The transition into light redondillas, for the purpose\r\nof interweaving with the serious business of the fable, the loves\r\nof a young Numantian named Morandro, and his mistress, is certainly\r\na fault in the composition of the tragedy. But to this fault we are\r\nindebted for some of the finest scenes in the following act. A solemn\r\nsacrifice is prepared; but amidst the ceremony an evil spirit appears,\r\nseizes the victim, and extinguishes the fire. The confusion in the\r\ntown increases. A dead man is resuscitated by magic, and the scene in\r\nwhich this incident occurs has a most imposing effect.[354] All hope\r\nhas now vanished. After the return of a second unsuccessful embassy,\r\nthe Numantians, by the advice of Theagenes, resolve to burn all their\r\nvaluable property, then to put their wives and children to death, and\r\nlastly to throw themselves in the flames, lest any of the inhabitants\r\nof the town should become the slaves of the Romans. Scenes of the most\r\nheart-rending domestic misery, and the noblest traits of patriotism\r\nthen ensue.[355] Famine rages in Numantia.[356] Morandro, accompanied\r\nby one of his friends, ventures to enter the Roman camp. He returns\r\nwith a piece of bread smeared with blood, and, presenting it to his\r\nfamished mistress, falls at her feet mortally wounded.[357] The action\r\nproceeds with unabated interest to the end. An allegorical character of\r\nFame enters at the close of the piece, and announces the future glory\r\nof Spain.\r\n\r\nAllegorical characters, for instance, Necessity and Opportunity,\r\nlikewise appear in Cervantes’s comedy, _El Trato de Argel_ (Life\r\nin Algiers, or Manners in Algiers). But their introduction amidst\r\nscenes of common life injures the story, which is besides by no means\r\ningenious, and imparts a cold and whimsical character to the piece.\r\nThis comedy, however, which is divided into five acts, is not destitute\r\nof interest and spirit.\r\n\r\nThe romance of Persiles and Sigismunda, which Cervantes finished\r\nshortly before his death, must be regarded as an interesting appendix\r\nto his other works.[358] The language and the whole composition of the\r\nstory, exhibit the purest simplicity, combined with singular precision\r\nand polish. The idea of this romance was not new, and scarcely deserved\r\nto be reproduced in a new manner. But it appears that Cervantes at the\r\nclose of his glorious career took a fancy to imitate Heliodorus. He\r\nhas maintained the interest of the situations, but the whole work is\r\nmerely a romantic description of travels, rich enough in frightful\r\nadventures, both by sea and land. Real and fabulous geography and\r\nhistory are mixed together in an absurd and monstrous manner; and the\r\nsecond half of the romance, in which the scene is transferred to Spain\r\nand Italy, does not exactly harmonize with the spirit of the first half.\r\n\r\nIf we cast a glance on the collected works of Cervantes, in order to\r\nascertain what their author was entitled to claim as his original\r\nproperty, independently of his contemporaries and predecessors, we\r\nshall find that the genius of that poet, who is in general only\r\npartially estimated, shines with the brighter lustre the longer it is\r\ncontemplated. That kind of criticism which is to be learnt, contributed\r\nbut little to the developement and formation of his genius. A critical\r\ntact, which is a truer guide than any rule, but which abandons genius\r\nwhen it forgets itself, secured the fancy of Cervantes against the\r\naberrations of common minds, and his sportive wit was always subject\r\nto the control of solid judgment. The vanity which occasionally made\r\nhim mistake the true bent of his talent, must be confessed to have been\r\npardonable, considering how little he was known to his contemporaries.\r\nHe did not even know himself, though he felt the consciousness of\r\nhis genius. From the mental height to which he had raised himself,\r\nhe might, without too highly rating his own abilities, look down on\r\nall the writers of his age. More than one poet of great, of immortal\r\ngenius, might be placed beside him in his own country; but of all the\r\nSpanish poets Cervantes alone belongs to the whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOPE DE VEGA.\r\n\r\nLope Felix de Vega Carpio, the rival and conqueror of Cervantes in\r\nthe conflict of dramatic art, was born at Madrid, in the year 1562.\r\nHe was consequently fifteen years younger than Cervantes. Marvellous\r\nstories are related respecting the early developement of his poetic\r\ngenius and his talent for composing verses. Though his parents were\r\nnot rich, yet he received a literary education; and he is also said to\r\nhave distinguished himself in corporeal exercises. He lost his parents\r\nbefore he was old enough to attend the university; but through the\r\nassistance of Don Geronymo Manrique, the grand inquisitor, and Bishop\r\nof Avila, who was much attached to him, he was enabled to complete a\r\ncourse of philosophy at Alcala. After obtaining his degree at that\r\nuniversity, he returned to Madrid, where he became secretary to the\r\nDuke of Alba. He shortly afterwards married; and from this period,\r\nwhich seemed to promise a career of tranquil happiness, the stormy\r\nvicissitudes of his life commenced. He became engaged in a quarrel,\r\nfought a duel, wounded his antagonist dangerously, and was obliged\r\nto fly. For several years he lived an exile from Madrid; and on his\r\nreturn his wife unfortunately died. Harrassed by this series of\r\ncalamities, and being as warm a patriot as he was a sincere catholic,\r\nhe entered into one of the military corps which were embarked on board\r\nthe invincible armada for the invasion of England. Though he himself\r\nreturned in safety to Madrid, yet he was deeply grieved at the ill\r\nsuccess of the armada. His vigorous constitution, however, enabled\r\nhim to keep up his spirits; he again became a secretary, once more\r\nentered into the married state, and passed some time in uninterrupted\r\ndomestic happiness. On the death of his second wife, who survived her\r\nmarriage only a few years, he resolved to forego the pleasures of the\r\nworld, and for that purpose took holy orders. He did not, however,\r\nretire to a convent; but he devoted himself wholly to the study of\r\npoetry,--to that study, which from childhood upwards, had principally\r\nengrossed his mind, and in the active prosecution of which he produced\r\nso extraordinary a result, that it is difficult to conceive how any\r\nman could even during the most protracted existence, write as much as\r\nLope de Vega: and yet he spent a part of his life in civil business,\r\nand in the discharge of military duties. He composed in all the various\r\nkinds of verse which were in use in his time; and he succeeded in all.\r\nBut his dramas in particular were received with an enthusiasm which\r\nthe labours of no other Spanish poet had ever excited. He so precisely\r\nstruck the chord which harmonized with the taste of the Spanish public,\r\nthat he has been worshipped as the inventor of the national comedy,\r\nthough he only pursued the tract which Torres Naharro originally opened.\r\n\r\nLope de Vega’s fertility of invention is as unparalleled in the history\r\nof poetry, as the talent which enabled him to compose regular and well\r\nconstructed verses with as much facility as if he had been writing\r\nprose. Cervantes styles him _el monstruo de naturaleza_, (the prodigy\r\nof nature) and this name was not given him merely in levity. He was\r\nconstrained by no rules of criticism; not that he was ignorant of the\r\ntheory of the ancient poetry, but he took delight in letting his verses\r\nflow freely from his pen, confident in the success of whatever he might\r\nproduce. The public, he observed, paid for the drama, and he thought it\r\nbut fair that those who paid should be served with that which suited\r\ntheir taste. Lope de Vega required no more than four-and-twenty hours\r\nto write a versified drama of three acts in redondillas, interspersed\r\nwith sonnets, tercets and octaves, and from beginning to end abounding\r\nin intrigues, prodigies, or interesting situations. This astonishing\r\nfacility enabled him to supply the Spanish theatre with upwards of\r\ntwo thousand original dramas, of which not more than three hundred\r\nhave been preserved by printing. In general the theatrical manager\r\ncarried away what he wrote before he had even time to revise it;\r\nand immediately a fresh applicant would arrive to prevail on him to\r\ncommence a new piece. He sometimes wrote a play in the short space of\r\nthree or four hours. The profits which the theatrical managers derived\r\nfrom the writings of Lope de Vega, enabled them to bestow such liberal\r\npayment on the author, that at one time he is supposed to have been\r\npossessed of upwards of a hundred thousand ducats. But he did not long\r\npreserve his fortune, though from the commencement of his celebrity he\r\nalways possessed enough to enable him to live with comfort. His purse\r\nwas ever open to the poor of Madrid.\r\n\r\nBut Lope de Vega’s poetic talent procured him even more glory than\r\ngain. No Spanish poet was ever so much honoured during his life. The\r\nnobility and the public vied in expressing their admiration of him.\r\nHe was chosen president (_capellan mayor_) of the spiritual college\r\nof Madrid, of which he had previously been admitted as a member. Pope\r\nUrban VIII. sent him the cross of Malta, and the degree of doctor of\r\ntheology, accompanied by a flattering letter. The pope also appointed\r\nhim fiscal of the apostolic chamber. For these distinctions Lope\r\nde Vega was not indebted merely to his poetic talents. No Spanish\r\npoet of celebrity had hitherto manifested in his writings such\r\nenthusiastic interest for the triumph of the catholic religion. He\r\nwas accordingly appointed familiar to the inquisition, a post which\r\nwas at that period regarded as singularly honourable. But the Spanish\r\npublic adopted another mode of expressing their admiration of their\r\nfavourite dramatist. Whenever Lope de Vega appeared in the streets,\r\nhe was surrounded by crowds of people, all eager to gain a sight of\r\nthe prodigy of nature. The boys ran shouting after him, and those who\r\ncould not keep pace with the rest, stood and gazed on him with wonder\r\nas he passed. He died in 1631, in the sixty-third year of his age. His\r\nfuneral was conducted with princely magnificence. The ceremony was\r\ndirected by his patron, the Duke of Susa, whom he appointed executor\r\nof his will. The music of the high mass which was celebrated at his\r\nfuneral, was executed by the performers of the chapel royal. During\r\nthe exequies, which lasted three days, three bishops officiated in\r\ntheir pontifical robes. The memory of the “Spanish Phenix,” as he was\r\nusually styled by the publishers of his plays, was celebrated with no\r\nless pomp in all the theatres of Spain. Arithmetical calculations have\r\nbeen employed, in order to arrive at a just estimate of Lope de Vega’s\r\nfacility in poetic composition. According to his own testimony, he\r\nwrote on an average five sheets per day; it has therefore been computed\r\nthat the number of sheets which he composed during his life, must have\r\namounted to one hundred and thirty-three thousand, two hundred and\r\ntwenty-five, and that allowing for the deduction of a small portion of\r\nprose, Lope de Vega must have written upwards of twenty-one millions,\r\nthree hundred thousand verses.[359]\r\n\r\nNature would have overstepped her bounds and have produced the\r\nmiraculous, had Lope de Vega, along with this rapidity of invention\r\nand composition, attained perfection in any department of literature.\r\nNature, however, did her utmost for Lope de Vega; for even the rudest,\r\nmost incorrect, and verbose of his works, are imbued with a poetic\r\nspirit which no methodical art can create. This poetic spirit is, at\r\nthe same time so national and so completely Spanish, that without\r\nan intimate acquaintance with the works of other Spanish poets, and\r\nparticularly those who flourished at an early period, it is impossible\r\nto perceive Lope de Vega’s merits and defects, or to understand their\r\nconnection with each other. On this account, however, he was in a\r\npeculiar manner the poet of the Spanish public, the favourite of all\r\nranks; and on this account have his writings always been partially or\r\nerroneously judged.\r\n\r\nLope de Vega was born for dramatic poetry. In every other class of\r\ncomposition, he was merely an accurate imitator, or if he struck out\r\na new course, it was in so imperfect a way, that his example was\r\ninjurious to the cause of literature. But as a dramatic poet, if he did\r\nnot create the Spanish comedy, properly so called, his inexhaustible\r\nfancy and the fascinating ease of his animated composition confirmed\r\nto it that character which has since distinguished it. All subsequent\r\nSpanish dramatic poets trod in the footsteps of Lope de Vega, until\r\ngenius was banished from the sphere it occupied by the introduction\r\nof the French taste in Spain. The successors of Lope de Vega merely\r\nimproved on the models which he had created. He fixed for a century\r\nand a half the spirit and the style of nearly all the different kinds\r\nof dramatic entertainment in Spain. It may therefore be proper to\r\nunite with a notice of the dramatic works of Lope de Vega, a sketch of\r\nthe characteristics of the various species of plays then performed in\r\nSpain; and this sketch will at the same time serve as a key to all the\r\npeculiarities of the Spanish drama.\r\n\r\nSince the age of Lope de Vega, the word comedy (_comedia_) has had\r\nin the dramatic language of Spain a totally different signification\r\nfrom that which was attached to it by the ancient Greeks and Romans,\r\nand which it retains in most countries of modern Europe. It is the\r\ngeneric name of several species of drama, some of which, according to\r\nour established notions, are neither comedies nor tragedies; but all\r\nof which approximate to one common spirit of invention and execution.\r\nThe critic will inevitably form an erroneous judgment of these works,\r\nif he be guided by notions deduced from the Greek and Roman drama,\r\nand which, with certain limitations, are applicable to all dramatic\r\ncompositions except the Spanish comedy. The spirit of the Spanish\r\ncomedy must not be sought for in that popular satire, which constitutes\r\nthe very essence of the ancient and modern comedy, properly so called.\r\nThe compositions in which it is to be found are of a totally different\r\nnature. In them stories of country and city life are clothed in\r\nromantic poetic colours, and blended with the interesting inventions\r\nof a bold and irregular fancy, without any distinction between the gay\r\nand the serious, or the comic and the tragic. In a word, a Spanish\r\ncomedy is in its principle a dramatic novel; and as there are tragic,\r\ncomic, historical, and purely imaginative novels, so, in like manner,\r\nthe Spanish comedy readily adopts those various modes of exciting\r\ninterest on the stage. In Spanish comedies as in novels, princes\r\nand potentates are no more out of place than jockeys and fops; and\r\nthese dissimilar characters may all be introduced on the stage at\r\nonce, should the progress of the intrigue require so heterogeneous\r\nan approximation. Satire is therefore merely an agreeable accessary\r\nin the Spanish comedy, of which the poet may avail himself at his\r\npleasure. In these comedies the powerful delineation of character\r\nis no more essential than in novels. Even a motley combination of\r\nburlesque and serious, vulgar and pathetic scenes, is not hostile to\r\nthe spirit of a Spanish comedy, the object of which is not to maintain\r\nthe interest in a particular direction. The subject of the piece\r\nmay be a moving or a horrific story; still the picture presented is\r\nentertaining, but entertaining in a manner totally different from\r\nthat kind of comedy which exhibits the follies of life in a satirical\r\npoint of view. A continuance of the pathetic or the horrific would be\r\nas little congenial to the spirit of those dramatic novels which the\r\nSpaniards call comedies, as a continuance of the ludicrous. In this\r\nis manifested the first of the peculiar conditions required by the\r\nSpanish public, of which notice has already been taken in treating\r\nof the origin of the Spanish comedy. With any other people than the\r\nSpaniards these dramatic novels would have assumed a somewhat different\r\ncharacter, without, however, departing from their original spirit. But\r\nthis class of dramatic composition, which admits of the most singular\r\nmixture of the pompous and the ludicrous, was particularly suited to\r\nthe Spaniards of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as by it\r\nthey were relieved from any long duration of serious impressions.\r\nWith this first requisite of a changeable dramatic form, which Lope\r\nde Vega completely satisfied, was associated a second. A complicated\r\nplot was indispensable in every drama, the subject of which was drawn\r\nfrom the sphere of common life. As a substitute for that sort of plot\r\nin historical comedies, extraordinary and striking adventures were\r\nintroduced, and in spiritual comedies, miracles. According to the\r\nuniversally received notion of a Spanish comedy, in Lope de Vega’s\r\ntime, no distinction was made between the sacred and the profane\r\nstyles; for a legend was dramatized as a spiritual novel.\r\n\r\nWhether a nation which was satisfied with such comedies did or did not\r\nbeguile itself of the purest and most perfect developement of dramatic\r\ngenius, is a question for separate discussion. But the Spanish comedy\r\nconsidered in all its modifications, as a particular species of drama,\r\nmay stand the test of sound criticism; and Lope de Vega in a great\r\nmeasure contributed to fix the national taste in these modifications.\r\nIn his time the classification was first made of sacred and profane\r\ndramas, or as the Spaniards called them, _comedias Divinas y Humanas_.\r\nThe profane comedies were again divided into _comedias Heroycas_,\r\n(Heroic comedies); and _comedias de Capa y Espada_, (comedies of the\r\nCloak and Sword.) The heroic comedies were originally the same as the\r\nhistorical, but the title was subsequently extended to mythological and\r\nallegorical dramas. The comedies of the _Capa y Espada_, were founded\r\non subjects selected from the sphere of fashionable life, and exhibited\r\nthe manners of the age; they were likewise performed in the costume of\r\nthe times. At a later period a subdivision of these _comedias de Capa y\r\nEspada_ was formed under the name of _comedias de Figuròn_, because the\r\nprincipal character was either a needy adventurer representing himself\r\nas a rich nobleman, or a lady of the same class. In Lope de Vega’s time\r\nalso, the sacred comedies began to be divided into dramatized _Vidas\r\nde Santos_ and _Autos Sacramentales_. Both classes were founded on the\r\nmodel of the dramas, which used to be represented in the cloisters. The\r\n_Autos Sacramentales_, which had all a reference to the administration\r\nof the sacrament, according to catholic notions, seem to have had\r\ntheir origin in the age of Lope de Vega; at least in the prelude to\r\none of his _Autos_ (the word literally signifies acts) a countrywoman\r\nquestions her husband respecting the nature of these dramas.[360]\r\nFinally, to the different kinds of Spanish comedy existing in Lope de\r\nVega’s age, must be added the little preludes or recommendatory pieces,\r\ncalled _loas_, and the interludes, or _entremeses_, introduced between\r\nthe prelude and the principal comedy, and which when interspersed with\r\nmusic and dancing, are denominated _saynetes_.\r\n\r\nHeroic and historical comedies form a considerable portion of the\r\ndramatic works of Lope de Vega, in so far as they have been preserved.\r\nThe tragic scenes in many of these comedies, so well harmonized with\r\nthe national taste of the Spaniards, that they readily dispensed with\r\ngenuine tragedy; and as vivid a recollection of the old national\r\nhistory was maintained by these theatrical representations as by the\r\nold romances. But few of Lope’s historical comedies relate, like his\r\n_Gran Duque de Moscovia_, to foreign subjects. In point of composition,\r\nhis dramas do not materially differ one from the other. Even in his\r\nhistorical pieces, he uses such freedoms with respect to the unity of\r\naction, that only a slight similitude connects the acts and scenes\r\ntogether; and he totally disregards the unities of time and place. The\r\nexecution of these dramas is no less irregular than their composition.\r\nAccording to the humour in which the author happened to be when engaged\r\nin his literary labour, his descriptions and language are vigorous or\r\nfeeble, noble or mean, unpolished or highly refined. A description\r\nof _Las Almenas de Toro_ (the Battlements of Toro), one of the best\r\nproductions in the class to which it belongs, will afford a tolerably\r\ncorrect idea of Lope de Vega’s historical comedies. The subject of this\r\npiece is the murder of King Don Sancho, by Bellido Dolfos, a knight\r\nwhom the king had offended by a violation of his promise, a story\r\nwhich has likewise furnished materials for several old romances. The\r\nCid Ruy Diaz is a principal character in this comedy, which, like all\r\nothers of the same kind, is divided into three acts.[361] The scene\r\nopens with a view of the country before the strongly fortified town of\r\nToro in Leon. The King Don Sancho, the Cid, and a Count Anzures enter.\r\nThe king explains to the two knights, that state reasons prevent him\r\nfrom fulfilling his father’s will, and that he cannot leave his two\r\nsisters, the infantas Elvira and Urraca, in possession of the strong\r\nfortresses of Toro and Zamora.[362] The Cid with noble sincerity\r\navows his opinion of the king’s injustice towards his sisters, and\r\noffers himself as a mediator in the dispute. The king and Count\r\nAnzures retire. The Cid advances to the walls, and meets a knight\r\nnamed Ordonez, who has just come out of the fortress to execute some\r\nenterprize in favour of the infanta Elvira. Both knights are about to\r\ndraw; but they recognize each other, and embrace. The Cid is pourtrayed\r\nin all the greatness of his character.[363] The infanta appears on the\r\nwalls, and states to the Cid her reasons for not opening the gates\r\nto her brother. The king re-appears, and orders preparations for\r\nstorming the garrison. The scene changes--Don Vela, an old knight who\r\nhas withdrawn from the tumult of public life, appears in front of his\r\ncountry residence. He communes with himself in a speech full of dignity\r\nand beauty, but in some passages too poetical for the drama.[364]\r\nHis daughter enters singing, and surrounded by a rustic group. This\r\nscene introduces a romantic episode which is interwoven with the main\r\naction, and the hero of which is a prince of Burgundy, disguised as a\r\npeasant, who is enamoured of the daughter of Don Vela. The scene again\r\nchanges to the neighbourhood of Toro. The infanta Elvira appears on\r\nthe battlements, and negotiations are once more set on foot. The king\r\nhimself holds a conversation with his sister, which, however, produces\r\nno conciliatory result. This brief, pointed, and not very courteous\r\ndialogue, is interspersed with plays of wit on the word _Toro_, the\r\nname of the fortress, which in Spanish signifies a bull.[365] The king\r\ninstantly commands scaling ladders to be brought, and the storming\r\nof the fortress commences, but the besiegers are repulsed. Thus the\r\nfirst act concludes. With the commencement of the second act the\r\nrural episode becomes more nearly allied to the main action. A sonnet\r\nin which the disguised prince of Burgundy, and his mistress Sancha,\r\nexpress their sentiments of mutual attachment, affords an instance of\r\nthat protracted kind of metaphor, which Lope de Vega employed on such\r\noccasions, and which, a hundred years afterwards, Metastasio likewise\r\nadopted in his opera songs, as the poetic language of passion.[366]\r\nDon Bellido Dolfos prevails on the king to promise him the hand of\r\nthe infanta Elvira, on condition of his taking the fortress. By dint\r\nof the vilest perfidy Bellido Dolfos succeeds; but the king, who is\r\nof opinion that a traitor should be rewarded with treachery, refuses\r\nto abide by his promise. Bellido Dolfos meditates revenge. Meanwhile\r\nElvira escapes in the disguise of a peasant, and takes refuge in the\r\nhouse of Don Vela. With this combination of heroic and tender, domestic\r\nand rural situations, the action proceeds, until Bellido Dolfos murders\r\nthe king; an incident, however, which does not take place oh the stage.\r\nThe infanta Elvira returns to Toro, where she receives the homage of\r\nher people, and the prince of Burgundy avowing his real character, is\r\nunited to his beloved Sancha.\r\n\r\nLope de Vega’s _Comedias de Capa y Espada_, or those which may\r\nproperly be denominated his dramas of intrigue, though wanting in the\r\ndelineation of character, are romantic pictures of manners, drawn from\r\nreal life. They present, in their peculiar style, no less interest\r\nwith respect to situations than his heroic comedies; and the same\r\nirregularity in the composition of the scenes. The language, too, is\r\nalternately elegant and vulgar, sometimes highly poetic, and sometimes,\r\nthough versified, reduced to the level of the dullest prose. Lope\r\nde Vega seems scarcely to have bestowed a thought on maintaining\r\nprobability in the succession of the different scenes; ingenious\r\ncomplication is with him the essential point in the interest of his\r\nsituations. Intrigues are twisted and entwined together, until the\r\npoet, in order to bring his piece to a conclusion, without ceremony\r\ncuts the knots he cannot untie; and then he usually brings as many\r\ncouples together as he can by any possible contrivance match. He has\r\nscattered through his pieces occasional reflections and maxims of\r\nprudence, but any genuine morality which might be conveyed through the\r\nstage, is wanting, for its introduction would have been inconsistent\r\nwith that poetic freedom on which the dramatic interest of the Spanish\r\ncomedy is founded. His aim was to paint what he observed, not what he\r\nwould have approved, in the manners of the fashionable world of his\r\nage; but he leaves it to the spectator to draw his own inferences.\r\nIn this indirect way only, could the Spanish public tolerate useful\r\napplications in the drama; for the Spaniard always considered the\r\nmorality with which he was occupied in church sufficient. An exuberant\r\ngallantry, which may or may not be veiled by decorum, and which is at\r\nall times only slightly restrained by notions of honour, but never by\r\na sense of moral duty, constitutes the very essence of these dramas,\r\n_de Capa y Espada_. Where the passion is vehement, it advances with\r\ntrue Spanish ardour to the attainment of its object; where it is\r\ntender and sentimental, the romantic tirades and far-fetched plays of\r\nwit are inexhaustible. That _love excuses every thing_, was at this\r\ntime the darling maxim of the gay world in Madrid; and in conformity\r\nwith its spirit, Lope de Vega’s young heroes and heroines plunge\r\nheadlong into intrigue. Free scope is given to the basest artifice\r\nand perfidy; the man of fashion draws his sword on the slightest\r\nprovocation; and whether he desperately wounds, or even kills his\r\nadversary, is a matter of indifference. Disguises, too, abound in these\r\ndramas. One of the most interesting of Lope’s comedies in this class,\r\nis _La Villana de Xetafe_, (the Peasant Girl of Xetafe, a village\r\nin the vicinity of Madrid). It exhibits a series of the boldest and\r\nmost dexterous impostures, by means of which the interesting heroine\r\nsucceeds in entrapping her lover, who is a man of condition, into the\r\nbonds of matrimony. The confessors must have found some difficulty in\r\ncounteracting the ill effects which could not fail to be occasionally\r\nproduced by such examples, though they were by no means set up as\r\nmodels. The fascinating natural painting of these intrigues, which at\r\nthe same time always possess a certain poetic elevation, constitutes\r\nthe chief charm of Lope de Vega’s comedies. The deviation from nature\r\nin expression, which has frequently been a subject of reproach to\r\nthis prolific writer, is in most instances merely attributable to\r\nnegligence or rapidity of composition. He faithfully embodies the\r\ngeneral forms of character, which, to be sure, are all alike in the\r\nclass of Spanish comedies now under consideration. The _vejete_ (old\r\nman), the _galan_ (lover), the _dama_ (young lady), together with\r\na suitable number of servants and waiting women, are the standing\r\ncharacters which are constantly introduced with no variety, except in\r\nthe situations; but at the same time, they are drawn in such animated\r\ncolours, that the perusal of one or two of these dramas of intrigue is\r\nsufficient to render the reader familiar with the whole world which the\r\npoet describes. In Lope’s comedies, as in real life, the (_gracioso_)\r\nbuffoon and the fool are occasionally the same character. They have\r\nalso superfluous parts; personages totally unconnected with the\r\nbusiness of the drama are sometimes introduced.\r\n\r\nIn order to afford an idea of the composition of this portion of the\r\ndramatic works of Lope de Vega, we may select, as a specimen, the\r\ncomedy entitled, _La Viuda de Valencia_ (the Widow of Valencia). It\r\nis one of the pieces of this master in the art of intrigue in which\r\nthe complication is best contrived, and it is besides remarkable in\r\nthe class to which it belongs for the unity which is preserved in the\r\naction. The scene is laid in Valencia in the time of the carnival.\r\nLeonarda, a young rich and handsome widow, living according to her\r\nown fancy, has resolved never to re-marry. She enters with a book\r\nin her hand; for she reads works of all sorts, sacred and profane,\r\nnot from piety or love of literature, but merely to amuse herself,\r\nwhile she never deigns to bestow a thought on the suitors by whom\r\nshe is surrounded. On the subject of her reading she discourses very\r\nreasonably with her waiting woman.[367] Her arch attendant turns\r\nthe conversation in such a way, that the young widow, with all her\r\npretended wisdom, is induced to view herself in a looking glass, and\r\nin the very act of doing so, she is surprised by a visit from her\r\nuncle. The old gentleman assures his fair niece, who is highly vexed\r\nat the surprise, that she does well to convince herself of the power\r\nof her charms by such indisputable testimony.[368] When, however,\r\nhe begins to talk of marriage, the lady contemptuously sketches a\r\nburlesque portrait of a Madrid beau,[369] and describes, though in a\r\nless happy style the unfortunate consequences of an imprudent match.\r\nThe old uncle takes his leave, and the scene changes, or rather it is\r\ntransferred to the other division of the stage. The three admirers of\r\nthe beautiful Leonarda meet each other in front of her house. They\r\nexpress their wishes and hopes in sonnets, the subjects of which are\r\nlong-winded metaphors. As none of the party can boast of his mistress’s\r\nfavour, they mutually acknowledge their ill success, and each describes\r\na burlesque adventure, which has occurred to him during the night, in\r\nfront of Leonarda’s house. One relates, that under the supposition\r\nthat he was stabbing a rival, he thrust his poignard into a skin of\r\nstolen wine.[370] Meanwhile Leonarda hastily returns from church,\r\nwhere she has seen a young gentleman with whom she has fallen deeply\r\nin love. She immediately forms a plan to induce this gentleman, whose\r\nname is Camillo, to visit her, without either knowing who she is or\r\nwhither he is conducted. The whole intrigue is managed by Leonarda’s\r\ncoachman Urbano, who is at the same time the _gracioso_, or buffoon\r\nof the piece.[371] While Urbano is gone out in quest of Camillo, the\r\nthree suitors, without any previous arrangement with each other,\r\narrive disguised as dealers in books and copper-plate prints. They\r\nobtain an interview with Leonarda, and make avowals of their passion;\r\nbut she receives them very unfavourably, and they are all obliged to\r\nmake a rapid retreat to avoid being roughly handled by the servants.\r\nThis scene is highly amusing. In the second act Camillo appears,\r\nand after long hesitation, he consents to engage in the romantic\r\nadventure. Urbano dresses him in a doctor’s cloak, and drawing the\r\nhood (_capirote_) over his eyes, he conducts him blindfold, with comic\r\neffect, through a variety of windings, to the house of Leonarda. The\r\nlady receives him in the dark. Lights are afterwards brought in, but\r\nLeonarda remains masked. A sumptuous collation is prepared, of which\r\nthe young gentleman’s doubt and embarrassment will not permit him to\r\ntaste a morsel. He compares himself to Alexander, when he took the\r\nsuspected goblet from the hand of his physician.[372] A tender dialogue\r\nensues, after which the hood is again drawn over the eyes of Camillo,\r\nand he is conducted from Leonarda’s house. In this manner the intrigue\r\nproceeds; but between many of the scenes, whole days, and even weeks\r\nare supposed to intervene. Leonarda and her lover become more and more\r\nintimate, though he neither knows who she is, nor where she resides.\r\nAll his endeavours to discover these secrets are unavailing; and at\r\nlength he begins to suspect that his unknown mistress is an old cousin\r\nof Leonarda. In the mean time the three rejected suitors, who still mix\r\nin the plot, become jealous of the coachman Urbano; and one spirited\r\nscene succeeds another until an affray occurs in which an honourable\r\nsuitor of Leonarda is wounded. This accident produces the denouement.\r\nCamillo recognizes in his unknown mistress the beautiful widow with\r\nwhom he was previously acquainted, and whose hand he joyfully accepts.\r\nThus the piece is a comedy from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nLope de Vega’s spiritual comedies, afford a picture of the religious\r\nnotions of the Spaniards in the age in which he lived, not less\r\nfaithfully pourtrayed than that by which his dramas of intrigue\r\nrepresent the manners of Spanish society. Pure piety, according\r\nto catholic ideas, wildly blended with the most contradictory\r\nchimeras, and these chimeras again ennobled by the boldest flights of\r\nimagination, form altogether a monstrous and extravagant patch-work;\r\nbut this heterogeneous variety is, nevertheless, united by the\r\nramifications of a poetic spirit, into a whole, to which no European\r\nimagination could now be expected to produce a resemblance. But Lope\r\nde Vega seems not to have come to a positive determination respecting\r\nwhat ought to have been the true spirit of these dramatic pictures of\r\nreligious faith. The mixture of poetic and unpoetic elements is very\r\nunequal in his different spiritual comedies. His Lives of the Saints\r\npossess far more dramatic spirit than his Autos Sacramentales; while\r\non the other hand, allegory imparts a higher dignity to the religious\r\nmysticism of the latter. Both, however, have in common a kind of\r\noperatic style, combined with the display of theatrical machinery and\r\ndecoration, calculated to captivate the senses. Of all the dramatic\r\nworks of Lope de Vega, the Lives of the Saints are in every respect the\r\nmost irregular. Allegorical characters, buffoons, saints, peasants,\r\nstudents, kings, God, the infant Jesus, the devil, and all the most\r\nheterogeneous beings that the wildest imagination could bring together,\r\nare introduced. Music seems always to have been an indispensable\r\naccessary. Lope de Vega’s spiritual comedy, entitled the Life of Saint\r\nNicolas de Tolentino,[373] commences with a conversation maintained by\r\na party of students, who make a display of their wit and scholastic\r\nlearning. Among them is the future saint, whose piety shines with the\r\nbrighter lustre when contrasted with the disorderly gaiety of those\r\nby whom he is surrounded. The devil disguised by a mask joins the\r\nparty. A skeleton appears in the air; the sky opens, and the Almighty\r\nis discovered sitting in judgment attended by Justice and Mercy, who\r\nalternately influence his decisions. Next succeeds a love intrigue\r\nbetween a lady named Rosalia, and a gentleman named Feniso. The future\r\nsaint then re-enters attired in canonicals, and delivers a sermon\r\nin redondillas. The parents of the saint congratulate themselves on\r\npossessing such a son; and this scene forms the conclusion of the first\r\nact. At the opening of the second a party of soldiers are discovered;\r\nthe saint enters accompanied by several monks, and offers up a prayer\r\nin the form of a sonnet. Brother Peregrino relates the romantic history\r\nof his conversion. Subtle theological fooleries ensue, and numerous\r\nanecdotes of the lives of the saints are related. St. Nicolas prays\r\nagain through the medium of a sonnet. He then rises in the air, either\r\nby the power of faith, or the help of the theatrical machinery; and the\r\nHoly Virgin and St. Augustin descend from heaven to meet him.[374] In\r\nthe third act the scene is transferred to Rome, where two cardinals\r\nexhibit the holy sere cloth to the people by torch light. Music\r\nperformed on clarionets adds to the solemnity of this ceremony, during\r\nwhich pious discourses are delivered. St. Nicolas is next discovered\r\nembroidering the habit of his order; and the pious observations which\r\nhe makes, while engaged in this occupation, are accompanied by the\r\nchaunting of invisible angels. The music attracts the devil, who\r\nendeavours to tempt St. Nicolas. The next scene exhibits souls in the\r\ntorments of purgatory. The devil again appears attended by a retinue\r\nof lions, serpents, and other hideous animals; but in a scene, which\r\nis intended for burlesque, (_graciosamente_) a monk armed with a great\r\nbroom drives off the devil and his suite.[375] At the conclusion of the\r\npiece the saint whose beatification is now complete, descends from\r\nheaven in a garment bespangled with stars. As soon as he touches the\r\nearth, the souls of his father and mother are released from purgatory\r\nand rise through a rock; the saint then returns hand-in-hand with his\r\nparents to heaven, music playing as they ascend.\r\n\r\nThe _Autos Sacramentales_ of Lope de Vega must have been far less\r\nattractive than his Lives of the Saints. Compared with the latter,\r\ntheir construction appears very simple, and they are executed in a\r\nstyle of theological refinement which could not have been perfectly\r\nintelligible to the multitude. But the allegorical characters, which\r\nare the most prominent in these pieces, produce an imposing effect.\r\nThe dramas themselves are in general short. In one which represents\r\nthe fall, Man disputes with Sin and the Devil, and Earth and Time take\r\npart in the dialogue. Next are discovered Justice and Mercy seated\r\nbeneath a canopy, and at a table furnished with writing materials.\r\nMan is interrogated before this tribunal. The Prince of heaven, or\r\nSaviour, enters. Reflection, or Care, (_Cuidado_) kneels and delivers\r\na letter to him. The Saviour, who takes his station behind a grating,\r\nmakes Man undergo another judicial examination, and pardons him.[376]\r\nBut the devil re-appears and protests against the pardon.[377] Man\r\nhas next to contend with Vanity and Folly, who are introduced as\r\nallegorical characters. Christ again appears with the crown of thorns.\r\nIn conclusion, the heavens open and Christ ascends to his celestial\r\nthrone, with the usual accompaniment of music. Direct allusions to the\r\nsacrament of the altar were seldom necessary in the Autos, as the whole\r\ntendency of the allegorical action was directed to that object.\r\n\r\nLope de Vega’s _Loas_, and more particularly his _Entremeses_ and\r\n_Saynetes_, seem to have been intended to indemnify the audience for\r\nthe theological allegory of the sacramental dramas; for it is only in\r\nconnection with the Autos that these preludes and interludes are to be\r\nfound. The Loas are not always comic, and are sometimes only spirited\r\nmonologues. The interludes, or Entremeses and Saynetes, may also be\r\ncalled preludes, for though they were performed after the Loa, which\r\nwas properly the prologue, yet they preceded the Auto: these interludes\r\nare burlesque from beginning to end, and form a preparation for the\r\ndevotion of the Auto, quite in the Spanish taste. Farces of this kind,\r\npourtraying the incidents of common life, never destitute of genuine\r\ncomic spirit, and written for the most part in verse, soon became\r\nindispensable to the Spaniards, and even to this day are never omitted\r\nin their dramatic performances. The interludes of Lope de Vega and\r\nCervantes seem to have been the models of all that succeeded them.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic genius of Lope de Vega has rendered him immortal. In the\r\nseventeenth century his plays were universally read and performed\r\nthroughout Spain. In general they were first published singly, and\r\nfor the most part with the bookseller’s epithet--_Comedia Famosa_,\r\n(the Celebrated Comedy), which subsequently became a universal device,\r\naffixed to all comedies printed in Spain. In this manner Lope de Vega’s\r\nmost popular comedies were, partly during the life of the author, and\r\npartly after his death, collected in five-and-twenty volumes;[378]\r\nexclusively of the Autos, preludes, and interludes, which afterwards\r\nformed a separate publication.[379] Among Lope’s scattered dramas which\r\nhave been printed at a later period, are some which are expressly\r\ndenominated tragedies.[380]\r\n\r\nThe other poetic works of this prolific writer, must be very briefly\r\nnoticed; for to give any thing like a particular account of them\r\nwould require the space of a considerable volume.[381] In epic poetry\r\nhe maintained an unsuccessful contest with Tasso. His _Jerusalem\r\nConquistada_,[382] consists indeed of twenty cantos in octaves, and\r\ncontains some beautiful passages, but it will in no respect bear a\r\ncomparison with the Italian poem. Lope de Vega also augmented the\r\nnumber of the continuers of Ariosto’s Orlando, by the publication of\r\n_La Hermosura de Angelica_,[383] (the Beauty of Angelica), which is\r\nalso a narrative poem in twenty cantos, though shorter than those\r\nof the Jerusalem. His other attempts at epic composition are--_La\r\nCorona Tragica_,[384] (the Tragic Crown), or the history of the\r\nunfortunate Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland; and the _Circe_ and\r\n_Dragontea_.[385] The _Corona Tragica_ is full of furious invective\r\nagainst the protestants and against Queen Elizabeth in particular.[386]\r\nThe hero of the _Dragontea_ is Admiral Drake, who is introduced in\r\nthis poem as the tool of Satan, in order that he may finally serve as\r\nan example of poetic justice. To compete with Sanazzar, Lope wrote a\r\nsecond Arcadia,[387] in the style of the Italian. He likewise wrote\r\nseveral poems, which may be called eclogues in the proper sense of\r\nthe term. His _Arte Nueva de Hazer Comedias_, (New Art of Writing\r\nComedies), is a humorous satire on his opponents under the appearance\r\nof ridiculing himself.[388] He anonymously supplied the _Romancero\r\nGeneral_ with thirty-six romances.[389] His spiritual poems are to\r\nbe found in great profusion; and the number of his sonnets, some\r\nof which possess first-rate merit, is considerable. His _Laurel de\r\nApolo_, a Eulogy on various Spanish Poets, which has been frequently\r\nquoted, is but an indifferent production.[390] His epistles are\r\nsufficiently numerous. Among his miscellaneous poems, those of the\r\ncomic kind have most originality, as for example: _La Gatomachia_,\r\n(the Battle of Cats),[391] and the whole collection of miscellaneous\r\npoems which he published under the assumed name of the Licentiate Tomè\r\nde Burguillos.[392] Among his most celebrated prose works, are _El\r\nPeregrino en su Patria_, (the Stranger in his own Country), a tolerably\r\nlong novel.[393] _Dorothea_, a dramatic story, or as it is called,\r\n_Accion en Prosa_;[394] and a Collection of Novels.[395]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BROTHERS LEONARDO DE ARGENSOLA.\r\n\r\nAmong the poets who flourished during the period now under\r\nconsideration, the place next in rank to Cervantes and Lope de\r\nVega, must be assigned to two brothers, whom their countrymen have\r\nsurnamed the Horaces of Spain. Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola\r\nborn in 1565, and Bartholemè Leonardo de Argensola, born in 1566,\r\nbelonged to a respectable family, of Italian origin, but settled in\r\nArragon. Lupercio, who pursued his academic studies in Saragossa,\r\nhad the satisfaction to witness the successful performance of three\r\ntragedies, which he wrote in the twentieth year of his age, and which\r\nare honourably mentioned by Cervantes in his Don Quixote. His taste,\r\nhowever, led him to cultivate another style of poetry, in which he\r\ncould imitate Horace, of whom he was an enthusiastic admirer. His\r\nfamily connection facilitated his introduction to persons of rank;\r\nand he became secretary to the Empress Maria of Austria, who at that\r\ntime resided in Spain. He was soon after appointed chamberlain to the\r\nArchduke Albert of Austria. King Philip III. nominated him one of\r\nthe chroniclers or historiographers of Arragon, and directed him to\r\ncontinue the annals of Zurita; and the states of Arragon, which already\r\npossessed their own particular chronicler, seized some plausible excuse\r\nfor dismissing him, in order that Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola\r\nmight also be appointed historiographer for them. He then determined\r\nto devote himself exclusively to the duties of his office; but he\r\nwas induced to go to Italy in company with the Count de Lemos, the\r\ncelebrated patron of Cervantes, who was at that time viceroy of Naples.\r\nLupercio was appointed secretary of state and of war for Naples; but\r\namidst the varied and laborious duties attached to such a situation,\r\nhe actively pursued his poetic studies, and did not even discontinue\r\nhis Arragonese annals. He was the principal founder of the academy at\r\nNaples. While prosecuting this honourable career he died in 1613, in\r\nthe fortieth year of his age. Like Virgil, when he felt the approach of\r\ndeath, he burnt a considerable portion of his poems.\r\n\r\nBartholemè, the younger Leonardo de Argensola, entered the\r\necclesiastical state. During the first half of his life, his success\r\nin the world was inseparably connected with the fortunes of his\r\nbrother. He was chaplain to the Empress Maria of Austria, then a canon\r\nin Saragossa; and afterwards proceeded to Naples in company with his\r\nbrother and the Count de Lemos. He quitted Italy on the death of his\r\nbrother, and was appointed to complete the continuation of the annals\r\nof Arragon which Lupercio had left in an imperfect state; a task which\r\nhe executed in a way that gave universal satisfaction. While the\r\nCount de Lemos was president of the council of the Indies, Bartholemè\r\nLeonardo de Argensola wrote a history of the conquest of the Molucca\r\nislands. He was indefatigable in the pursuit of his historical and\r\npoetic studies; and after passing a tranquil and honourable life, he\r\ndied at Saragossa in 1631, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.[396]\r\n\r\nThe poetry of these two brothers, who, in a critical point of view,\r\nmay both be regarded as one individual, is not characterized by\r\noriginality, or by depth of genius, in the extended sense of the\r\nword. It is, however, remarkable for a fine poetic feeling distinct\r\nfrom enthusiasm, a vigorous and aspiring spirit, a happy talent for\r\ndescription, poignant wit, classic dignity of style, and above all,\r\nsingular correctness of taste. Both pursued the same course with equal\r\nardour and adroitness; but Bartholemè had the better opportunity of\r\ncultivating his talent, because he lived longest. Next to Luis de Leon,\r\nthey are the most correct of all Spanish poets.\r\n\r\nThe tragedies with which Lupercio commenced his poetic career,\r\nconsidered as youthful essays, are worthy to be remembered, though\r\nthey do not merit the unbounded praise which Cervantes bestowed on\r\nthem in a fit of panegyrical enthusiasm. It appears that they did not\r\nlong maintain their place on the stage. Two of the three mentioned by\r\nCervantes were, at no very remote period, rescued from oblivion, and\r\nthe third still remains undiscovered.[397] The two which have been\r\nrecovered, and which are entitled, the one _Isabella_, and the other\r\n_Alexandra_, afford excellent specimens of language and versification.\r\nThe Alexandra contains scenes, particularly in the second and third\r\nacts, which the greatest tragic writer might advantageously adopt and\r\ninterweave into a better constructed piece.[398] The Isabella is a\r\ntrivial web of love intrigues, and terminates in a manner sufficiently\r\nawful; but the piece is totally destitute of tragic dignity,\r\nnotwithstanding that it exhibits the languishing and raging of two\r\nMoorish kings, with all the pomp of oriental accessaries. Alexandra\r\npresents more numerous and correct traits of resemblance to the ancient\r\ndrama; and yet towards the close the action becomes most extravagant,\r\nand is marked by all the tumult of a modern theatrical spectacle.\r\n\r\nBut the poetic fame of Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola, does not rest\r\non his tragedies. His lyric poems, epistles, and satires in the\r\nmanner of Horace, have transmitted his name, without the aid of any\r\nrecommendation to posterity. Lupercio formed his style after that\r\nof Horace, with no less assiduity than Luis de Leon; but he did not\r\npossess the soft enthusiasm of that pious poet, who in the religious\r\nspirit of his poetry is so totally unlike Horace. An understanding\r\nat once solid and ingenious, subject to no extravagant illusion, yet\r\nfull of true poetic feeling, and an imagination more plastic than\r\ncreative, impart a more perfect horatian colouring to the odes, as\r\nwell as to the canciones and sonnets of Lupercio. He closely imitated\r\nHorace in his didactic satires, a style of composition in which no\r\nSpanish poet had preceded him. But he never succeeded in attaining\r\nthe bold combination of ideas which characterizes the ode style of\r\nHorace; and his conceptions have therefore seldom any thing like the\r\nhoratian energy. On the other hand, all his poems express no less\r\nprecision of language, than the models after which he formed his style.\r\nHis odes, in particular, are characterized by a picturesque tone of\r\nexpression, which he seems to have imbibed from Virgil rather than from\r\nHorace.[399] The extravagant metaphors by which some of Herrera’s odes\r\nare deformed, were uniformly avoided by Lupercio. His best sonnets\r\nare those of a sententious cast, which have some moral idea for their\r\nsubject.[400] He was likewise successful in the composition of popular\r\nsongs in redondillas. His epistles in tercets present, in their\r\nkind, about the same degree of resemblance to the epistles of Horace,\r\nas is observable between his odes and those of his classic model.\r\nThe ideas are expressed in a clear, precise, and pleasing style; and\r\nthese compositions are not destitute of poetic and didactic interest.\r\nStill, however, the vigour of Horace is wanting.[401] Lupercio did\r\nnot enter, with sufficient decision, into the true spirit of horatian\r\nsatire. He consigned to his brother the task of cultivating that class\r\nof composition, in which poetry is scarcely distinguishable from\r\nspirited prose. Among his writings, which escaped the flames, there is\r\nonly one piece of satirical raillery, in the form of an epistle to a\r\ncoquette.[402]\r\n\r\nThe poetic works of Bartholemè, the younger Leonardo de Argensola,\r\nwhich have been preserved, are twice as numerous as those of Lupercio.\r\nThe style of the two brothers is so similar, that in some cases it is\r\ndifficult, and in others totally impossible to distinguish the one\r\nfrom the other. This extraordinary conformity of character, talent and\r\ntaste, appears at first sight no less singular a phenomenon than the\r\ninexhaustible fertility of Lope de Vega. But it will be recollected,\r\nthat these brothers, who were nearly of an age, and almost inseparable\r\ncompanions, and who were constantly occupied in the study and imitation\r\nof the same models, could not fail, by the cultivation of similar, and\r\nin neither original talents, closely to approximate. Still, however,\r\ntraces of difference are discoverable in their works. Bartholemè,\r\nby his numerous epistles and satires, performed greater services to\r\nSpanish poetry than his brother Lupercio. He was the first Spanish\r\nwriter who introduced concentrated satire in sonnets, which he probably\r\ndid after he became acquainted with the Italian poems of that class,\r\nbut he has imitated them with the spirit of Horace, and has avoided\r\nevery thing like Italian flippancy. His spiritual canciones, which\r\nare not equalled by any in the poetic works of Lupercio, are among\r\nthe best in the style to which they belong. His most esteemed works\r\nbear the impress of a more cultivated talent than is discernible in\r\nthe writings of his brother. His longer and properly didactic satires\r\nare characterized by more causticity than gaiety in the ridicule of\r\ngeneral and particular follies.[403] But the enthusiasm of the moralist\r\nnever leads him into declamation in the manner of Juvenal; and these\r\nsatires are equally replete with traits of mild philanthropy and\r\nsound judgment. His epistles on human felicity and human weakness have\r\nnearly the same character, but they are for the most part serious and\r\ndevoid of irony.[404] His satirical sonnets present unequal degrees\r\nof merit; but in the best, the pupil of Horace is more obviously\r\nrecognisable.[405] That Bartholemè should have succeeded in spiritual\r\ncanciones, may at first sight be deemed a psychological enigma. But it\r\nwas precisely his critical and reflective turn of mind which proved\r\nmost essentially serviceable in guiding him through the gloomy regions\r\nof catholic mysticism. Being an enthusiastic catholic, he wanted\r\nno extraordinary inspiration to furnish him with religious ideas;\r\nand the faculties of a language eminently picturesque, supplied him\r\nwith new views and images which he alternately developed in majestic\r\ndescriptions,[406] and pleasing comparisons.[407]\r\n\r\nThe praises lavished on the Argensolas by all parties, would afford\r\nsufficient ground for the conjecture that their poetic works had\r\nproduced some influence on their contemporaries. But that influence is\r\nchiefly obvious from the poetic style of the men of talent with whom\r\nthey lived on terms of intimacy, of one of whom, named Alonzo Esquerro,\r\nthere is extant a short but excellent epistle, published along with the\r\nanswer of Bartholemè de Argensola.\r\n\r\nThe historical works of the younger Argensola, are also deserving\r\nof honourable mention in an account of the polite literature of\r\nSpain. Few narratives of Indian affairs are written with so much\r\njudgment and elegance as his History of the Conquest of the Molucca\r\nIslands;[408] and his continuation of the Annals of Zurita,[409]\r\nexceeds in rhetorical merit the work of the original historiographer.\r\nThe circumstances connected with the accession of Charles V. and the\r\nCastilian rebellion, subjects to which no Spanish writer had previously\r\nventured to allude, are related by Argensola with no less freedom and\r\nfidelity than other events; though of course without his attempting to\r\nurge any apology for the rebels. In the reign of Philip III. but little\r\ndanger was to be apprehended from such freedom; and when, in the year\r\n1621, Philip IV. ascended the throne in the seventeenth year of his\r\nage, Argensola did not hesitate to dedicate his Arragonian Annals to\r\nthe Duke of Olivarez, who in the name of the young king was invested\r\nwith unlimited sovereign authority. The Duke of Olivarez on receiving\r\nthis dedication little imagined that the recollection of the ancient\r\nprivileges of the Arragonian states, which had been solemnly ratified\r\nby Charles V. and which were so much expatiated on in these annals,\r\nwould, at no very remote period, be the means of rousing the people of\r\nArragon to take up arms in defence of their constitution, on which the\r\nduke wished to encroach, in order to recruit the exhausted strength of\r\nCastile.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY OF SPANISH POETRY AND ELOQUENCE\r\n    DURING THE AGE OF CERVANTES AND LOPE DE VEGA.\r\n\r\nA very accurate idea of the general spirit of elegant literature in\r\nSpain, during the age of Cervantes and Lope de Vega, will be obtained,\r\nif, to an examination of the works of those eminent men and the two\r\nArgensolas, be added a recollection of the labours of their immediate\r\npredecessors; for the other Spanish poets of this period followed in\r\nthe beaten path as far as they were able to go, and if any one ventured\r\non a new course he only wandered into insipidity. These authors, though\r\ndeficient in originality, are not without merit; but so great is their\r\nnumber, that it would be impossible to find room for even a very brief\r\nnotice of all their works in a general history of literature. There\r\nwas at this time a sort of poetical ferment in Spain, which can only\r\nbe compared with that which prevailed in Italy during the sixteenth\r\ncentury. The blending of the Italian style with the old Spanish, had\r\nexcited a new enthusiasm throughout the whole nation; and in proportion\r\nas the Spaniards were excluded from philosophic thinking, their passion\r\nfor works of fancy was augmented. Under these circumstances eloquence\r\ncould only follow in the train of poetry.[410]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRESH FAILURES IN EPIC POETRY--ERCILLA’S ARAUCANA.\r\n\r\nSuccess in epic poetry was still denied to the Spanish muse. The\r\nconfounding of epic poetry with relations of actual events embellished\r\nwith poetic language, seems to have perverted the talent for true\r\nepopee. The Spanish poets who attempted this style, studied after the\r\ndeceitful model of Lucan, and, according to an old critical phrase,\r\nendeavoured to be more _Lucanists_ than Lucan himself. The imagination\r\nwhich possessed unbounded dominion over the stage, seems to have\r\nobtained in narrative poetry only the scanty privilege of inventing a\r\nfew ornaments.\r\n\r\nAmong the unsuccessful attempts at epopee, particular distinction is\r\ndue to the _Araucana_ of the heroic and amiable Alonzo de Ercilla y\r\nZuñiga, a poem which has the accidental advantage of being better\r\nknown on this side of the Pyrenees than many other Spanish works of\r\nfar superior merit. Ercilla has recorded the most remarkable events\r\nof his own biography in the _Araucana_, and the remainder of the poem\r\nalso reflects an interest on the author. He was born at Madrid in\r\n1540, or according to some in 1533, and became page to the prince of\r\nAsturias, Don Philip, with whom he travelled to Italy, the Netherlands,\r\nand England. At the age of twenty-two, he embarked as an officer for\r\nAmerica, along with a newly appointed viceroy of Peru. He distinguished\r\nhimself in the war against the Araucans, the bravest of the South\r\nAmerican tribes. In the midst of his exploits, he conceived with a\r\nyouthful ambition the plan of writing a narrative of the conquest of\r\nArauco in an epic form, but with the strictest regard to historical\r\ntruth. He executed his project in spite of the dangers which surrounded\r\nhim, and the fatigues he had to undergo. In a wilderness inhabited by\r\nsavages, in the midst of enemies, and under no other cover than that of\r\nheaven, he composed at night the verses which were to be the memorials\r\nof the events of the day. In prosecution of his purpose, he was obliged\r\nto use scraps of waste paper, which often could not contain more than\r\nsix lines, or to make pieces of leather supply the total want of paper.\r\nIn this way he completed the first part of his poem, consisting of\r\nfifteen cantos. Before he was thirty years of age he returned to Spain,\r\nfull of hope, both as a soldier and a poet; but the gloomy Philip,\r\nto whom he enthusiastically dedicated the _Araucana_, took little\r\nnotice of him, and less of his work. Ercilla deeply felt this neglect;\r\nbut nothing could damp his romantic attachment to his cold-hearted\r\nsovereign, whom he still persisted in celebrating in the sequel of his\r\npoem. He received no mark of favour except from the Emperor Maximilian\r\nII. who appointed him one of his chamberlains. Dissatisfied with his\r\nfate, Ercilla travelled from place to place; but his journies did not\r\nprevent him from proceeding with his poem until he completed it by the\r\naddition of a third part. When he died is not known, but it was after\r\nhe had attained his fiftieth year.\r\n\r\nThe _Araucana_, so called from the country Arauco, is really no\r\npoem. It is, however, impossible to read the work without becoming\r\nattached to the author, and being delighted by his talent for lively\r\ndescription, and for painting situations, his possession of which no\r\njust critic can call in question. But notwithstanding that talent,\r\nErcilla is merely a versifying historian, capable of clothing his\r\nsubject in a poetic garb, but not of elevating it to the sphere of true\r\npoetry. His diction is natural and correct; and to this the _Araucana_\r\nis in a great measure indebted for its celebrity. Its descriptive\r\nbeauties, and some scenes in the style of romantic love, certainly\r\nmake the composition approximate to poetry; but the heroic spirit\r\nwhich pervades the whole work, is by no means a poetic spirit. The\r\nprincipal events follow each other in chronological order. The combats\r\nare described in succession, as they actually arose, without any regard\r\nto poetic interest. Ercilla, indeed, prided himself on this historical\r\nprecision, and he challenged any of his countrymen who were acquainted\r\nwith the war in Arauco, to detect a single inaccuracy in his narrative.\r\nThe historical succession of events imparts, however, a sort of epic\r\nunity to the work. The Spaniards in Arauco are surrounded by dangers,\r\nwhich gradually augment until they reach a crisis; when a reinforcement\r\narrives from Peru, and the Spaniards experience a favourable change of\r\nfortune. The capture of Caupolican, the Araucan commander, who is put\r\nto death in a way repugnant to humanity, closes the narrative, though\r\nit does not terminate the war; but the barbarous and unjust execution\r\nof this brave chief being decreed by a Spanish council of war, is not\r\ncensured by Ercilla. From the manner in which the poem concludes, it\r\nmust be regarded as incomplete, considered as an historical narrative.\r\nEven the moral interest of the events operates in a way contrary to\r\nthe intention of the author; for the feelings of the unprejudiced\r\nreader are, from the commencement excited in favour of the brave\r\nsavages, who half-naked, and destitute of fire arms, contend for their\r\nnatural freedom against enemies so superior in the art of war. The\r\nstyle of historical truth in which the principal events are narrated,\r\nforms a disagreeable contrast with the fiction in the details, which is\r\nintended to diffuse a poetic character over the whole work; for Ercilla\r\nat length found it necessary to depart from his plan in order to escape\r\nfrom the monotony into which he had fallen. In the first fifteen cantos\r\nthe poetic colouring is merely confined to the descriptions; but in\r\nthe two following parts,[411] the author has interwoven a number of\r\nfabulous accessaries. He has introduced, for example, a poetic account\r\nof the magician Fiton’s wonderful skill and garden of paradise,[412]\r\nand also the story of the fair savage Glaura, who recounts the\r\nincidents of her life in the style of a Spanish romance.[413] Ercilla\r\nlikewise relates the death of Dido after Virgil, and in honour of his\r\nking he gives a detailed account of the battle of Lepanto. In addition\r\nto the descriptions, some of the speeches, particularly that delivered\r\nby the Cacique Colocolo in the second canto,[414] may be referred to as\r\nthe best parts of this unpoetic poem.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the passion for epic poetry, which took possession of so many\r\nSpanish writers in the age of Cervantes and Lope de Vega, gave birth to\r\na torrent of heroic poems. To the Caroliads, which have already been\r\nnoticed, there succeeded _La Restauracion de España_, (the Restoration\r\nof Spain), by Christoval de Mesa; _Las Navas de Tolosa_, (the Plains\r\nof Toulouse), by the same author; _La Numantina_, by Francisco de\r\nMesquera; _La Invencion de la Cruz_, (the Invention of the Cross), by\r\nLopez Zarate; _Maltea_, by Hyppolyto Sanz; _El Leon de España_, (the\r\nSpanish Lion), by Pedro de Vezilla; _Saguntina_, by Lorenzo de Zamora;\r\n_Mexicana_, by Gabriel Laso de Vega; _Austriada_, by Rufo Guttieraz;\r\n&c. None but men who make this branch of literature their particular\r\nstudy, now think of perusing these and similar patriotic effusions,\r\nwhich were at the period of their publication regarded as epic\r\npoems,[415] but which only serve to prove, with the greater certainty,\r\nthat Spain is incapable of producing a Homer. A genuine subject for\r\nepopee was scarcely to be found in the national history of Spain, even\r\nduring the ages of chivalry; and modern history was not then more\r\nsusceptible than now of receiving a truly epic form.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYRIC AND BUCOLIC POETS OF THE CLASSIC SCHOOL OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nLyric and bucolic poetry and also elegant satire, after the two\r\nArgensolas had given the tone to that species of composition, continued\r\nto be cultivated by various pupils of the classic school of the\r\nsixteenth century. This school which was then on the decline in Italy,\r\nstill maintained its ground in Spain, and preserved its reputation in\r\nspite of the opposition made by the different parties who contended\r\nfor their respective styles, particularly by that of Lope de Vega,\r\nand by one of a still more dangerous kind, which will soon be more\r\ndistinctly noticed. The disciples of this classic school, together\r\nwith those writers who, since the time of Boscan and Garcilaso de la\r\nVega, had formed their style on the model of the ancients and the most\r\nesteemed poets of Italy, may be called the Spanish _Cinquecentisti_,\r\nin a favourable sense of the term, though some of them wrote in\r\nthe seventeenth century. The most distinguished among them really\r\nflourished in the sixteenth century; and the rest, whose number is\r\nincalculable, possessed, at least, the merit of endeavouring, like the\r\nItalian _Cinquecentisti_, to express sensible ideas in correct language.\r\n\r\nTo this classic school belongs Vicente Espinel, an ecclesiastic of the\r\nprovince of Granada. He was likewise celebrated as a musician, and he\r\nperfected the Spanish guitar by the addition of the fifth string. He\r\ndied in poverty, in the ninetieth year of his age, at Madrid in 1634.\r\nHis canciones, idyls, and elegies, though destitute of originality,\r\nare distinguished by a spirited and inartificial character, and they\r\nabound in beautiful images and descriptions. Espinel’s poetic style is\r\nextremely melodious. In his idyls he has very successfully imitated\r\nthe pleasing syllabic measure which Gil Polo introduced into Spanish\r\nliterature under the name of _Rimas Provenzales_;[416] and he was one\r\nof those writers who most contributed to bestow a metrical polish\r\non the redondilla stanzas of ten lines, (_decimas_). He translated\r\nHorace’s Art of Poetry, in iambic blank verse, and several of Horace’s\r\nOdes after the manner of Luis de Leon. Some of this author’s prose\r\nworks will hereafter be noticed.[417]\r\n\r\nChristoval de Mesa, an ecclesiastic of Estremadura, was contemporary\r\nwith Tarquato Tasso, with whom he maintained the most friendly\r\nintercourse. He made, however, very little improvement in epic art\r\nthrough his intimacy with that celebrated man. Of three compositions,\r\nwhich Christoval de Mesa intended for epic poems, not one has been\r\npreserved from oblivion. His tragedy of Pompey is likewise forgotten.\r\nHe was nevertheless a good translator; and his translations of the\r\nÆneid and the Iliad are esteemed even at the present day. He also\r\npublished a Spanish version of Virgil’s Georgics.\r\n\r\nJuan de Morales obtained a similar reputation through his translation\r\nof Horace’s Odes and Virgil’s Georgics. The particulars of his life are\r\nnot known. He wrote some good sonnets.[418] This writer must not be\r\nconfounded with his namesake, Ambrosio de Morales, the historian.\r\n\r\nAgustin de Texada, or Tejada, who was born in the year 1635, is\r\ndistinguished as a writer of spiritual odes and canciones. His poems in\r\nthis class vie with those of the younger Argensola in poetic dignity of\r\ncomposition and genuine lyric diction.[419] He has, however, committed\r\nthe error of introducing mythological images in his christian poetry.\r\nBut in this respect he merely conformed with the bad taste of his age,\r\nwhich in Spain and Portugal favoured the most absurd misapplication\r\nof the Greek mythology; for, to humour the prejudices of the church,\r\nit was necessary that the heathen deities should appear only as\r\nallegorical characters in catholic poetry.\r\n\r\nAndres Rey de Artieda, a brave Arragonian officer, was a very learned\r\nscholar and a particular friend of the Argensolas. Among other works,\r\nhe wrote poetic epistles which are full of good sense and natural\r\nfeeling.[420] His sonnets are remarkable for their novel and poignant\r\nstyle.[421]\r\n\r\nGregorio Morillo imitated Juvenal in his didactic satires, and vented\r\nhis spleen in well-turned verses.[422]\r\n\r\nLuis Barahona de Soto is, in preference to many of his contemporaries,\r\nentitled to an honourable place among Spanish poets. He was born in the\r\nprovince of Granada, and was a physician by profession. His eclogues\r\nresemble those of Garcilaso de la Vega; and his canciones abound in\r\nromantic grace.[423] His satires, which were lately republished, have\r\nthe spirit of Juvenal, but want the delicacy of Horace; they are,\r\nhowever, written in a clear and energetic style. This writer moreover\r\ngained celebrity by a continuation of the Orlando Furioso, which was\r\nhighly esteemed by Cervantes, and which is entitled, _Las Lagrimas de\r\nAngelica_, (the Tears of Angelica).[424]\r\n\r\nPedro Soto de Rojas, who was a particular favourite of Lope de Vega,\r\nendeavoured to introduce the academic systems of Italy, which had never\r\nbeen successfully imitated in Spain. A literary society established\r\nat Madrid, after the Italian fashion, received the ludicrous title of\r\n_Academia Selvaje_, (Academy of Savages;) and in this society Soto de\r\nRojas was distinguished by the surname of _l’Ardiente_. His eclogues\r\nhave the usual character of Spanish poems of that class, clothed in\r\nelegant and harmonious language.[425]\r\n\r\nLuis Martin, or Martinez de la Plaza, an ecclesiastic of Granada,\r\na province fertile in literary talent, was particularly celebrated\r\nfor the grace of his madrigals, and other small poems of a similar\r\nkind.[426]\r\n\r\nBalthazar del Alcazar, who appears to have been a native of Andalusia,\r\nsought to distinguish himself as a writer of epigrammatic madrigals.\r\nIn his comic madrigals,[427] he was, however, less successful than in\r\nthose of gallantry.[428] He also appears to have been one of the first\r\nSpanish poets who wrote odes in sapphic feet, in so far as the Spanish\r\nlanguage would permit the employment of that measure.[429]\r\n\r\nGonzalo de Argote y Molina, one of those brave men, who, in the\r\nreign of Philip II. combated with enthusiasm for the honour of their\r\ncountry and their king, but whose valour remained unrequited, was\r\nmore distinguished as an historian than as a poet. To his literary\r\npatriotism the Spaniards were indebted for the publication of the\r\nInfante Don Manuel’s _Conde Lucanor_.[430] His poems are, however,\r\nworthy of honourable notice. An ardent love of country is the soul of\r\nhis canciones and other lyric compositions.[431]\r\n\r\nFrancisco de Figueroa spent a portion of his life in Italy, in the\r\ntwofold capacity of an officer and a statesman. During his residence\r\namong the Italians, he enjoyed a degree of public esteem which was\r\nextended to few of his countrymen. He wrote poems in Italian as well as\r\nin Spanish. Among his friends and admirers he was called the _divine_,\r\nand he was ranked among the most eminent Petrarchists of his age. His\r\namatory sonnets are written in a pleasing and natural style, and abound\r\nin the softest touches of romantic melancholy.[432] The admirers of\r\nFrancisco de Figueroa likewise conferred on him the surname of the\r\nSpanish Pindar; but that was a mere whim.[433]\r\n\r\nChristoval Suarez de Figueroa, who was an imitator of Montemayor, wrote\r\na pastoral romance, entitled _Amarillis_, which was very generally read\r\nat the time of its publication. He also made a translation of Guarini’s\r\nPastor Fido, and cultivated with some degree of success the Italian\r\nlyric forms of pastoral romance. Some of the poems of the latter class\r\ncontained in the _Romancero General_, appear to be written by this\r\nauthor. His _Endechas_, or Elegiac Songs in the popular style, though\r\nnot particularly rich in ideas, are nevertheless pleasing with respect\r\nto language and versification.[434]\r\n\r\nAnother poet of this name, Bartholomè Cayrasco de Figueroa, is the\r\nauthor of a long series of spiritual canciones and tales called\r\n_cantos_, which were much esteemed on account of the edification\r\nattributed to their contents. In these poems he explains the mysticism\r\nof the christian religion, according to the catholic dogmas and the\r\nscholastic ideas of christian virtue, in a manner more pedantic than\r\npoetic; but yet in pure and elegant language. He was likewise one of\r\nthe Spanish imitators of the Italian verse with dactyllic terminations,\r\ncalled _versos esdrujolos_, from the Italian _versi sdruccioli_.[435]\r\n\r\nJuan de Arguijo, a native of Seville, seems to have enjoyed high\r\nreputation among the poets of his time. Lope de Vega formally dedicated\r\nseveral of his works to him. Some well written sonnets and other small\r\npoems are the only productions of this author now extant.[436]\r\n\r\nPedro Espinosa, an ecclesiastic who possessed some poetic talent,\r\nand who wrote on various subjects, compiled a lyric anthology of the\r\nworks of the above and other Spanish poets, who adhered more or less\r\nrigidly to the principles of the old school, but whose fancy sometimes\r\nroamed unrestrained with Lope de Vega, or sometimes degenerated into\r\naffectation with Gongora.[437]\r\n\r\n\r\nRISE OF A NEW IRREGULAR AND FANTASTICAL STYLE IN SPANISH POETRY.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to draw a rigid line of separation between the\r\ndisciples of the classic school, and the partizans of lyric\r\nirregularity, who indulged in no less freedom than Lope de Vega, while\r\nat the same time they endeavoured to exceed him in forced conceits.\r\nEven the disciples of the classic school are not totally exempt from\r\nextravagant ideas and unnatural metaphors; and they occasionally pour\r\nforth a torrent of words, which though sometimes big with brilliant\r\nideas, more frequently wastes itself in mere froth and foam. It\r\ncannot be doubted that the Italian school of the Marinists exercised\r\nan influence on these Spanish poets. But Marino, being a Neapolitan\r\nby birth, was a Spanish subject, and educated among Spaniards. It is\r\ntherefore more natural to regard his style as originally Spanish,\r\nthan to trace to Italy the source of those aberrations of fancy,\r\nwhich, in the age of Cervantes and Lope de Vega, again found admirers\r\nin Spain. Marino’s was the old Spanish national style, with all its\r\nfaults, divested of its ancient energy and purity, polished after\r\na new fashion, stripped of its simplicity, tortured into the most\r\nabsurd affectation of refinement, and that affectation displayed in a\r\nboundless prolixity.\r\n\r\nOne of the most zealous adherents of this party was Manuel Faria y\r\nSousa, a Portuguese by birth. Some cause of discontent had induced him\r\nto quit his native country and to fix his residence in Spain; and in\r\ncomposing both poetry and prose, he in general preferred the Castilian\r\nto his vernacular tongue.[438] It can scarcely be supposed that he\r\nintroduced this perverted taste from Portugal; though his Portuguese\r\npoems exhibit no less affectation of style than those which he composed\r\nin Castilian, and in which a judicious direction of the fancy is seldom\r\nobservable. His ideas are, for the most part, intolerably fantastic.\r\nOne of his Castilian songs, for example, is composed in honour of his\r\nmistress’s eyes, “in whose beauty, (he says) love has inscribed the\r\npoet’s fate, and which are as large as his pain, and as black as his\r\ndestiny, &c.”[439] He displays similar extravagance in most of his\r\nCastilian sonnets: in one, for instance, he relates “how ten lucid\r\narrows of chrystal, were darted at him from the eyes of his Albania,\r\nwhich produced a _rubious_ effect on his pain, though the cause was\r\nchrystaline,” &c.[440] In this absurd style he composed hundreds of\r\nsonnets. Faria y Sousa, however, wrote several good works on history\r\nand statistics;[441] and it must be recollected that in his poetry he\r\nmerely followed the party which he most admired, and which indeed had\r\nits precursors in Portugal as well as in Spain.\r\n\r\nThis party which soon became powerful, imitated the negligence of\r\nLope de Vega. But Lope de Vega was not a pedant; and when he failed\r\nin producing real beauties, he did not coin false ones. His pretended\r\nimitators, however, used the alloy of pedantry most unsparingly, and\r\nthereby carried the affectation of ingenious thoughts, in the style of\r\nthe Italian Marinists, to an incredible height.\r\n\r\n\r\nGONGORA AND HIS ESTILO CULTO--THE CULTORISTOS--THE CONCEPTISTOS.\r\n\r\nLuis de Gongora de Argote was the founder and the idol of the\r\nfantastical sect, which at this period led the fashion in literature,\r\nand attempted to create a new epoch in Spanish poetry by dint of\r\nexquisite cultivation and refinement. Gongora was a man of shrewd\r\nand powerful mind; but his natural faculties were perverted by a\r\nsystematic prosecution of absurd critical reveries. Through life he\r\nhad to maintain a constant struggle with the frowns of fortune. He was\r\nborn in Cordova, in the year 1561; and after completing his studies in\r\nhis native city found himself without any provision for the future.\r\nHe took holy orders, and after eleven years of solicitation at the\r\ncourt of Madrid, obtained a scanty benefice. The dissatisfied turn of\r\nmind, occasioned by his adverse fortune, contributed to develope that\r\ncaustic wit, for which he was particularly distinguished. He wrote\r\nsatirical sonnets, which for bitterness of spirit can scarcely be\r\nexceeded;[442] and he was still more successful in romances and songs\r\nin the burlesque satirical style. Works of this kind, did not, it is\r\ntrue, possess the merit of novelty in Spanish literature; but Gongora’s\r\nsatirical poems are vastly superior to those of Castillejo. It would\r\nbe scarcely possible to preserve, in a translation, the caustic\r\nspirit of Gongora’s romances and songs. To give full effect to these\r\ncompositions, the genuine national spirit of the serious romances and\r\ncanciones must never be lost sight of. In Gongora’s satirical works the\r\nlanguage and versification are correct and elegant, and the piquant\r\nsimplicity of the whole style would never lead to the supposition that\r\nthe ambition of marking an epoch in literature could have betrayed\r\nthe author into the most intolerable affectation.[443] He was less\r\nsuccessful in seizing the cordial tone of the old narrative romances.\r\nBut his canciones in the ancient Spanish style are in general masterly\r\ncompositions, full of true natural and poetic feeling.[444]\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless in one of his moments of ill-humour that Gongora\r\nconceived the idea of creating for serious poetry a peculiar\r\nphraseology, which he called the _estilo culto_, meaning thereby the\r\nhighly cultivated or polished style. In fulfilment of this object,\r\nhe formed for himself, with the most laborious assiduity, a style as\r\nuncommon as affected, and opposed to all the ordinary rules of the\r\nSpanish language, either in prose or verse. He particularly endeavoured\r\nto introduce into his native tongue the intricate constructions of\r\nthe greek and latin, though such an arrangement of words had never\r\nbefore been attempted in Spanish composition. He consequently found it\r\nnecessary to invent a particular system of punctuation, in order to\r\nrender the sense of his verses intelligible. Not satisfied with this\r\npatchwork kind of phraseology he affected to attach an extraordinary\r\ndepth of meaning to each word, and to diffuse an air of superior\r\ndignity over his whole style. In Gongora’s poetry the most common\r\nwords received a totally new signification; and in order to impart\r\nperfection to his _estilo culto_, he summoned all his mythological\r\nlearning to his aid. Such was Gongora’s _New Art_. In this style he\r\nwrote his _Soledades_, his _Polyphemus_, and several other works. Even\r\nthe choice of the title _Soledades_, (Solitudes), was an instance of\r\nGongora’s affectation; for he did not intend to express by that term\r\nthe signification attached to a similar Portuguese word, (_Saudade_),\r\nwhich is the title for a work relating to the thoughts and aspirations\r\nof a recluse. Gongora wished by his fantastic title to convey an idea\r\nof solitary forests, because he had divided his poem into _sylvas_,\r\n(forests), according to a particular meaning which the word bears in\r\nlatin. This work, like all Gongora’s productions in the same style,\r\nis merely an insipid fiction, full of pompous mythological images,\r\ndescribed in a strain of the most fantastic bombast.[445] The Duke\r\nof Bejar, to whom the work is inscribed, must, if he only read the\r\ndedicatory lines, have imagined himself transported to some foreign\r\nregion, in which the Spanish language was tortured without mercy.[446]\r\nGongora appears to have been peculiarly anxious to develope the spirit\r\nof his _New Art_, both at the commencement and the close of his\r\nwhimsical compositions.[447]\r\n\r\nGongora’s innovations did not, however, tend to better his fortune;\r\nfor when he died in 1627, he held merely the post of titular chaplain\r\nto the king. But his works were universally read in Spain; and in\r\nproportion as men of sound judgment emphatically protested against the\r\nabsurd innovations of the Gongorists, the more vehemently did these\r\nassert their pretensions.[448] Thus Gongora in some measure attained\r\nhis object. His arduous exertions to establish his style did not,\r\nit is true, promote him to a lucrative post; but they were rewarded\r\nwith the unlimited admiration of a numerous party, composed of men of\r\nhalf-formed taste, who found it easy in the crisis of the conflict\r\nbetween the Spanish national style and the Italian, to raise themselves\r\ninto importance. Proud of their half cultivation, they regarded every\r\nwriter who did not admire and imitate the style of their master, as a\r\nman of limited talent, incapable of appreciating the beauties of their\r\n_estilo culto_.[449] But none of Gongora’s partizans possessed the\r\ntalent of their leader, and their affectation became on that account\r\nstill more insupportable. They soon separated into two similar yet\r\ndistinct schools, one of which represented the pedantry of its founder,\r\nwhile the other, in order to render the art of versifying the easier,\r\neven dispensed with that precision of style which Gongora, in his\r\nwildest flights, still sought to preserve. The disciples of the first\r\nschool were proud to be the commentators of their master; and in their\r\nvoluminous illustrations of Gongora’s unintelligible works, they did\r\nnot neglect to pour forth all the stores of their erudition.[450] These\r\nwere called the _Cultoristos_, a name which was applied to them in\r\nderision. The second school of the Gongorists more nearly resembled\r\nthat of the Marinists; and its disciples were distinguished by the name\r\nof _Conceptistos_, in imitation of the Italian term _Concettisti_,\r\nwhich was applied to the followers of Marino. The _Conceptistos_\r\nrevelled in the wildest regions of fancy, without the least regard\r\nto propriety or precision, and were only desirous of expressing\r\npreposterous and extravagant ideas (_concetti_) in the unnatural\r\nlanguage of Gongora. Some individuals of this party were, however,\r\ninclined to imitate the careless style of Lope de Vega.\r\n\r\nAlonzo de Ladesma, who died a few years before Gongora, obtained\r\nadmirers for his poems, chiefly spiritual, which he wrote in the\r\nobscure phraseology of the _estilo culto_.[451] For example, in\r\nparaphrazing the mysteries of the catholic faith in lyric romances, he\r\nthus speaks of the birth of the Saviour:--“The star of the east rose\r\nat the time ordained by God, so that the enemy of day might lose the\r\nprey he had seized, and with it the hope of his false pretensions, as\r\nGod assumed human flesh in order that man might enjoy him,” &c.[452] To\r\nmen imbued with superstition, and denied all reasoning in matters of\r\nfaith, ravings of this kind were well calculated to turn their heads,\r\nand involve them in a vortex of romantic mysticism.\r\n\r\nFelix de Arteaga was likewise a zealous cultivator of this distorted\r\nstyle, both in sacred and profane poetry. In 1618, he held the post\r\nof court chaplain at Madrid, and he lived until the year 1633. The\r\nchief portion of his songs, romances, and sonnets, are of the pastoral\r\nkind. He extols “the miracles of the fair Amarillis, that angel of\r\nthe superior class, to whom truth and passion have given the name of\r\nPhœnix. She once espied before her door a peasant, who, though not\r\nworthy to adore her, was yet worthy to languish for her sake. This\r\nhappened one evening, which was a morning, since Aurora smiled, and\r\nshewed white pearls between rows of glowing carmine. The angel was\r\namused by burning those she had illumined, and this beautiful angel\r\nfell from the heaven of her ownself,” &c.[453] This author also wrote,\r\nafter the manner of Lope de Vega, a comedy, called _Gridonia_, which\r\nhe styles a royal invention, (_invencion real_), because potentates,\r\nprinces, and princesses are brought together from the most distant\r\nparts of the earth, and introduced with vast scenic pomp.[454]\r\n\r\nSome of the adherents of this party, who were distinguished for natural\r\ngenius and ability, will be hereafter noticed. We must not, however,\r\nneglect to mention that the _estilo culto_ likewise gained a footing\r\nin Spanish America; and that various works in that style by Alonzo de\r\nCastillo Solorzano, were very neatly printed at Mexico in the year\r\n1625.[455]\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO DRAMATIC POETS OF THE AGE OF LOPE DE VEGA.\r\n\r\nLope de Vega had now become the model of the Spanish dramatic poets,\r\nwho soon appeared as numerous, and laboured as assiduously as if they\r\nhad been bound to supply all the theatres in the universe with new\r\npieces. But most of these dramatists, who may altogether be considered\r\nas forming one great school, were contemporary with Lope de Vega only\r\nduring their younger years. The elegant Calderon, who was born in the\r\nyear 1600, may also have influenced the exercise of their talents. In\r\nthe history of the Spanish theatre, it will therefore be proper to\r\nrange together those dramatists on whom it is probable the example of\r\nCalderon may have operated.[456] This, however, is the proper place\r\nfor noticing two contemporaries of Lope de Vega.\r\n\r\nThe first of these writers, whose talents entitle them to an honourable\r\nrank in literature, is Christoval de Virues, a native of Valencia.\r\nHe fought in the battle of Lepanto, and is usually distinguished by\r\nhis military title of captain. The period of his death is not known.\r\nBoth Cervantes and Lope de Vega mention him in terms of commendation.\r\nVirues was not the pupil of Lope. Though older, as it would appear,\r\nthan that distinguished man, he was, like him, inspired with enthusiasm\r\nfor dramatic poetry; and they entered upon the same career at nearly\r\nthe same time. Virues did not adhere more attentively than Lope to\r\nthe strict rules of the ancient drama. But he wanted the fertile\r\nimagination of his rival, and he conceived it necessary that the modern\r\ndrama should approximate in a slight degree to the antique, at least\r\nin some of its forms. He was one of the Spanish dramatists by whom\r\nthe last attempts were made to separate tragedy from comedy; and his\r\nefforts in this way are deserving of more praise than has hitherto\r\nbeen conceded to them. Virues was a poet born for tragic art; but his\r\ngenius wanted cultivation. Pure poetic spirit, and a bold and energetic\r\nstyle, are the distinguishing features of all his works. But, like\r\nLope de Vega, he was every inch a Spaniard. He obeyed the influence\r\nof the national taste, and he could not restrain his own genius within\r\nthe bounds which he had himself prescribed. Among his five tragedies\r\nare some which might more properly be termed comedies, according to\r\nthe Spanish acceptation of the term.[457] It is obvious that Virues\r\nendeavoured to create a sphere of his own, and that in proportion as he\r\nwrote he made advances in his art. His _Semiramis_, the first tragedy\r\nhe wrote, which is chiefly in octaves, interspersed here and there\r\nwith redondillas, is crude both in conception and execution; but the\r\nlanguage even of this imperfect drama, makes energetic approaches to\r\nthat genuine expression of tragic pathos, which Cervantes and the elder\r\nArgensola in some measure attained.[458] His tragedy, entitled _La\r\nCruel Casandra_, which is richer in dramatic spirit, and more finished\r\nand systematic in its execution, might in the hands of a writer of\r\ngenius be easily rendered a tragic master-piece. Virues selected from\r\nthe history of the kingdom of Leon, the subject of this tragedy, in\r\nwhich he intended to unite the ancient and modern styles.[459] That\r\na drama of intrigue, like the _Casandra_, should not have obtained\r\ngreater popularity in Spain would be inexplicable, were it not for the\r\ndislike which the Spanish public manifested towards all dramas in\r\nwhich the tragic character was exhibited without the intervention of\r\ncomic scenes. Cultivated taste will, however, perceive many faults in\r\nthis tragedy. The uninterrupted delirium of passion, which prevails\r\nfrom the beginning to the end of the piece, renders the whole more\r\nastounding than impressive. The stormy movement of the action has,\r\nnotwithstanding, in most of the scenes, a very captivating effect;\r\nand that passionate vehemence, in the painting of which Virues was\r\neminently successful, is, in this drama, characteristically Spanish.\r\nThe horrible deaths with which the piece closes, and which, according\r\nto the nature of the catastrophe were by no means necessary, are\r\nlikewise in unison with the spirit of a Spanish national tragedy.\r\nThe spring of action is the wicked spirit of a revengeful woman whom\r\njealousy betrays into a series of the most treacherous intrigues. The\r\ndialogue is occasionally somewhat declamatory; but in its best parts\r\nit is energetic and unconstrained.[460] Of all the dramas of Virues,\r\nhis _Marcella_ in which princes, princesses, robbers, peasants, and\r\nservants, are jumbled together in irregular confusion, was doubtless\r\nmost in unison with the Spanish taste.\r\n\r\nThe other Spanish dramatist who remains to be noticed among the poetic\r\nwriters of the age of Lope de Vega, is Juan Perez de Montalvan,\r\nwhom Lope himself regarded as his first pupil, and who obtained,\r\nprobably through the interest of his patron, the post of notary to the\r\ninquisition. He was a young man of distinguished talent, and even in\r\nhis seventeenth year he wrote plays in the style of Lope de Vega. He\r\nfirst entered the lists in competition with his master, after whose\r\ndeath he pursued his literary occupations with such assiduity, that\r\nwhen he died in 1639, though aged only thirty-five, the number of\r\nhis comedies and autos amounted to nearly one hundred. He was also\r\nthe author of several novels, which will be particularly noticed in\r\nanother place. He put together in a single volume, some of his dramas\r\nand novels, and his moral reflections, full of formal erudition; and\r\nthis singular compilation was published under the no less singular\r\ntitle of Book for All.[461] His comedies are neither more finished nor\r\nmore systematic than those of his master, but they prove how easily a\r\nSpanish writer of imagination might, in that age, be roused to venture\r\ninto competition with the inexhaustible Lope de Vega, and also how\r\nfar a poet of talent, with a certain degree of practice, was capable\r\nof succeeding in dramatic intrigue. Montalvan’s comedies possess,\r\nhowever, a more particular interest, inasmuch as they exhibit traces\r\nof genius, which under other circumstances would have constituted a\r\npainter of dramatic character. In two of his historical comedies, he\r\nhas introduced Henry IV. of France, and Philip II. of Spain. A kind of\r\nmoral dignity, almost approaching to sanctity, is falsely attributed\r\nto the latter; but the prominent features of his character are truly\r\nseized and strikingly delineated.[462] The amiable Henry IV. is,\r\nhowever, pourtrayed to the life.[463] In his _Autos Sacramentales_,\r\nMontalvan even ventured to differ from Lope de Vega, in order to give\r\nto these dramas the popular character which Lope had sacrificed in his\r\nallegorical moralities. He composed an auto on the romantic conversion\r\nof Skanderbeg, in which drums, trumpets, clarionets, explosions of\r\nsquibs and rockets, and all the pomp of spectacle is introduced.\r\nBut the most extravagant creation of Montalvan’s fancy, is his auto\r\nof _Polyphemus_, in which the cyclops of that name appears as the\r\nallegorical representative of judaism; and the rest of the cyclops,\r\ntogether with the nymph Galathæa, and other mythological beings, are\r\nintroduced for the allegorical personation of faith and infidelity,\r\naccording to christian notions. To these characters are added, Appetite\r\nas a peasant, Joy as a lady, and finally the Infant Christ. Drum and\r\ntrumpet accompaniments are not forgotten in this auto. The cyclops\r\ntoo perform on the guitar; and an island sinks amidst a tremendous\r\nexplosion of fire works.[464]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVELS IN THE AGE OF CERVANTES AND LOPE DE VEGA.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that poetry, sometimes under heterogeneous, sometimes\r\nunder harmonizing forms, was, next to religion, the object which\r\nprincipally interested the Spanish public in the age of Cervantes and\r\nLope de Vega, yet elegant prose was not consigned to such obscurity as\r\nto engage only the attention of the learned. The old Spanish soundness\r\nof understanding which particularly displayed itself in Cervantes and\r\nthe two Argensolas, still, in some measure maintained its influence.\r\nBut upon the whole that rhetorical cultivation which had been so early\r\ndeveloped in Spain was obviously on the decline.\r\n\r\nNovels and romances, either decidedly bad or very indifferent, were\r\nas widely circulated as rapidly produced, and so great was their\r\nnumber that they counteracted the good effects which the master-piece\r\nof Cervantes must necessarily have produced under more favourable\r\ncircumstances. If few new romances of chivalry were now written, the\r\nold ones were read with the greater avidity. After the Galatea of\r\nCervantes, any very successful production in pastoral romance was\r\nscarcely to be expected. Romances, depicting the manners of modern\r\nsociety, were, however, proportionally the more numerous. Among the\r\nbest of the serious, but yet spirited productions of this class, is\r\nthe Life of _Marcos de Obregon_;[465] by the poet and musician Vicente\r\nEspinel.[466] The object of the author was, in his old age, to transmit\r\nuseful instruction to the rising generation in the form of a novel. The\r\nSpanish title in which the hero of the story is styled an _Escudero_,\r\nwould seem to indicate a romance of chivalry, but the whole character\r\nof the work is modern. The Escudero is a sort of gentleman or squire by\r\ncourtesy, and by no means a shield-bearer. The book is intended as a\r\nmoral warning for young men without fortune, who hope to get honourably\r\nthrough the world by attaching themselves to persons of distinction.\r\nThe story, though entertaining, presents nothing particularly\r\nattractive; the narration is rather prolix, but still natural; and the\r\ndiction plainly denotes the classic pupil of the sixteenth century,\r\nthough Espinel, as he states in his preface, consigned his romance to\r\nthe correction of Lope de Vega, whom he styles the “divine genius,”\r\nafter having himself revised the verses which Lope composed in his\r\nyouth. The insipid jokes which occur in Marcos de Obregon, for example\r\nthose in derision of the Portuguese and their language, must be\r\nconsidered as belonging to the natural local colouring of the work.\r\n\r\nAmong the romances of knavery, (_del gusto picaresco_), the celebrated\r\nDon Guzman de Alfarache may claim a distinguished place next to\r\nLazarillo de Tormes.[467] It was published in the year 1599, and\r\nconsequently before Don Quixote appeared. Like Lazarillo de Tormes it\r\nwas speedily translated into Italian and French, and was subsequently\r\npublished in various other languages, not excepting the latin. Mattheo\r\nAleman, the author of Guzman de Alfarache, who had withdrawn from the\r\ncourt of Philip III. and lived in retirement, was not induced by the\r\nsuccess of his comic romance, to devote himself to a second production\r\nof the same class. The knowledge of the world which he had acquired at\r\ncourt, as well as in the sphere of common life, is doubtless abundantly\r\nunfolded in his Guzman de Alfarache. The manners of the lower classes\r\nof Spanish society, in particular, seem to be pourtrayed with\r\nadmirable accuracy. In spite of the vulgarity of the subject, and the\r\nburlesque style in which it is treated, no ordinary share of judgment\r\nis perceptible throughout the whole of this comic novel; and in his\r\nhumorous language the author has preserved a certain degree of natural\r\nelegance even in describing the lowest scenes.\r\n\r\nThat the Spaniards were by no means sparing of approbation to works\r\nof this class, is obvious from the attention bestowed on the mannered\r\ncontinuation of Aleman’s romance, by a writer styling himself Mattheo\r\nLuzan, and still more by the favour lavished upon _La Picara Justina_,\r\na silly and pedantic pendant to Guzman de Alfarache, by a writer named\r\nUbeda. In Cervantes’s Journey to Parnassus, no literary production of\r\nthe age is so categorically condemned as this _Picara Justina_. And yet\r\nit was oftener printed, and probably more read than even the Journey to\r\nParnassus.\r\n\r\nLittle anecdotal stories of a sprightly character, likewise made their\r\nappearance in Spanish literature at this period. A collection of these\r\nproductions, connected together by means of dialogues, was published\r\nin 1610, under the title of Pleasant Dialogues for the Carnival time,\r\n(_Dialogos de Apacible Entretenimiento_), by Gaspar Lucas Hidalgo.\r\n\r\nThe political romance of Argenis, was pompously arranged to suit the\r\ntaste of the Spaniards of that age, by the Gongorist Pellicer de Salas.\r\n\r\nAmong the novels which possessed more of an imaginative character,\r\nthe best then produced were those of Perez de Montalvan, the dramatic\r\npoet.[468]\r\n\r\nThe present is not the proper place to introduce a complete or copious\r\nlist of all the works in the class above alluded to. Other writers have\r\nalready enumerated them with sufficient accuracy.[469] Unfortunately\r\neven the very best of these novels and narratives present no traces of\r\nthe advancement of taste and literary cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe novels of a Spanish lady, named Doña Mariana de Caravajal y\r\nSaavedra, must not be passed over without a particular notice.\r\nRespecting this authoress, who was a native of the city of Granada,\r\nbut little is said by the writers on Spanish literature. Her ten\r\nnovels have been frequently reprinted, and were apparently very well\r\nreceived by the public.[470] Doña Mariana states in her preface, that\r\nher novels are intended to afford amusement in “the lazy nights of\r\nchill winter;”[471] and they may, even now, be recommended to those\r\nwho stand in need of such amusement; for they are by no means devoid\r\nof fancy though they are written in a style of affected verbosity. The\r\nverses with which the tales are interspersed, exhibit no traces of\r\npoetic talent. In her preface, the authoress promises to present to the\r\nSpanish public, twelve comedies “from her ill-made pen,” as a proof of\r\nthe “kindness of her intention.”[472] Spain could indeed scarcely be\r\nexpected to give birth to a poetess in the true sense of the term. The\r\nterrible yoke imposed on the conscience and the understanding, against\r\nwhich even masculine genius could only contend by boldly plunging\r\ninto the wilds of romantic invention, weighed still more heavily on\r\nthe female mind, which without a certain spirit of freedom can seldom\r\nrange beyond the boundaries established by custom, and the routine of\r\nordinary thinking. Writers on Spanish literature, however, mention in\r\nterms of approbation, several female writers of verses, and also women\r\nof erudition, like Aloysia Sigea, distinguished for their knowledge of\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESSIVE CULTIVATION OF THE HISTORICAL ART--MARIANA.\r\n\r\nAt this period of Spanish eloquence, history was the only kind of\r\ncomposition which maintained its old precision and dignity, while of\r\nthe perfect cultivation of the other branches of prose literature there\r\nremained little hope.\r\n\r\nThe General History of Spain, by the Jesuit Juan de Mariana, though not\r\na model of historical art in the most extended sense of the term, is,\r\nin point of style, unquestionably a classic production. Mariana, who\r\nmay be said to have transferred the genuine spirit of the eloquence\r\nof the sixteenth century into the seventeenth,[473] was not one of\r\nthe pensioned historiographers or chroniclers who have already been\r\nfrequently mentioned, and who, it must be confessed, honourably\r\ndischarged their duties. He obtained reputation both in France and\r\nItaly as a professor of scholastic philosophy and theology; but his\r\nlove of literary retirement induced him to return to Spain. Of his own\r\nfree choice he undertook to compose a new general History of Spain\r\nfrom the earliest period to the death of Ferdinand the catholic. His\r\npredecessors had been sufficiently numerous, and he did not find\r\nit necessary to collect the materials for his history by laborious\r\ncompilations from the old authors and chroniclers of the middle ages.\r\nHe was thus at liberty to prescribe to himself a more pleasing task,\r\nnamely, that of judiciously combining the most interesting events,\r\nand describing them with rhetorical precision in elegant language.\r\nWith the view of acquiring a prose style, formed in the spirit of the\r\nclassic historians of antiquity, Mariana composed his work originally\r\nin latin,[474] a method which Cardinal Bembo had adopted in writing\r\nhis History of Venice. After he had completed this first labour, and\r\ndedicated the thirty books of his history in latin to Philip II.\r\nhe followed the example of Bembo in translating it himself, and he\r\nin fact recomposed it in Spanish.[475] This work he also dedicated\r\nto the king. Though this twofold dedication might have served to\r\nprove that the author was far from being liable to the imputation\r\nof cherishing views dangerous to the state, yet a party, with whose\r\ndesigns several passages of this history did not accord, found it easy\r\nunder the government of the ever jealous Philip, to cast on Mariana\r\nthe suspicion of favouring wicked and rebellious principles. He was\r\nformally brought before the inquisition, and it was with difficulty he\r\nescaped destruction. Had he devoted more attention to the philosophy\r\nof history, he could not so easily have repelled the charge of\r\nimpartiality, to aim at which was then considered an unwarrantable\r\nassumption not to be tolerated in any Spanish writer. But it is only\r\nin his style that Mariana was impartial. To exhibit facts as they\r\nstood in their natural connection, was sufficient to give umbrage to\r\nthe court and the inquisition; and solely to such an exposition was it\r\nowing, that the historian’s intentions became a subject of suspicion.\r\nElegant composition was his grand object; and in this respect he far\r\nexcels Bembo, because he is not, like him, mannered. His diction is\r\nperfectly faultless, his descriptions picturesque without poetic\r\nornament; and his narrative style may, on the whole, be accounted\r\na model. He has been very successful in avoiding protracted and\r\nartificially constructed sentences.[476] Mariana could not, however,\r\nresist the temptation of putting speeches into the mouths of his\r\nhistorical characters, after the manner of the ancient historians. In\r\nfine, comparing this history with other works of a similar kind, which\r\npreviously existed in Spanish literature, it will be found that, though\r\njustly entitled to a high share of esteem, it cannot be regarded as\r\nforming an epoch either in a philosophic or literary point of view.\r\n\r\nHaving described the rise and progress of the historical art in Spain,\r\nit cannot be necessary to give a minute notice of historical works,\r\nwhich for the most part possess only the negative merit of not being\r\nill written. The age of Cervantes and Lope de Vega was, moreover,\r\nthe period at which the historical literature of the Spaniards began\r\nto form itself into that perfect whole for which it is so peculiarly\r\nremarkable. At that time the old chronicles were committed to the\r\npress one after another: and the continuation and correction of the\r\nnational history was the only literary occupation which could be\r\npursued with any hope of success by men of talent, who felt no impulse\r\nto poetry; unless, indeed, they preferred to distinguish themselves in\r\nscholastic theology, or in writing books of pious edification, in which\r\nit was, above all things, necessary to take care to say nothing new.\r\n\r\nIt is still less necessary to enter upon a detailed examination of\r\nvarious works in the didactic department of Spanish literature, which\r\nare upon the whole not badly written, but not one of which exceeds in\r\nrhetorical merit the works of Perez de Oliva, Ambrosio de Morales,\r\nand other authors, who have already been mentioned. The writings of\r\nBalthasar, or Lorenzo Gracian, who endeavoured to introduce a kind of\r\n_gongorism_ into Spanish prose, will be more fully noticed at the close\r\nof the present book.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLUCTUATION OF SPANISH TASTE FROM THE CLASSIC TO THE CORRUPT STYLE.\r\n\r\nIn order to mark, by sensible gradations, the transition from the\r\ngolden age of Spanish poetry and eloquence, to those sad times, when\r\nthe energy of the national genius was, after a long conflict with\r\nopposing circumstances, destined to be overcome, it will be proper\r\nfirst to notice some poets and prose authors, who during the latter\r\nhalf of the period embraced by the present section, assumed a tone\r\npeculiar to themselves; and also, another set of writers who were their\r\nimmediate successors. Quevedo may with propriety be placed at their\r\nhead. During a part of his life he was contemporary with Cervantes,\r\nLope de Vega, and the Argensolas, and was, moreover, an opposer of\r\nthe New Art of Gongora. But both in poetry and prose he deviates so\r\nstrikingly from the classic, and so obviously approaches the ornamented\r\nand artificial style, that by commencing with him the retrograde course\r\nwhich Spanish literature began to take even in the period of its\r\nhighest cultivation, will be most distinctly perceived.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEVEDO.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the life of Francisco de Quevedo Villegas,[477] a\r\nman who has almost invariably been praised or censured with partiality,\r\nhad a most important influence on the developement and employment\r\nof his talents. He began even in childhood to breathe the air of\r\ncourts. He was born, in 1580, at Madrid, of a noble family, and was\r\neducated at the court under the care of his widowed mother who was\r\none of the ladies of the royal household. An eager curiosity was the\r\nfirst indication of his active and restless mind; and the impressions\r\nwhich he received in his infancy, induced him to make the scholastic\r\ntheology of catholicism his first study in preference to every other\r\nkind of knowledge. He was sent to the university of Alcala, where he\r\nreceived the degree of doctor in theology in his fifteenth year, a\r\nfact which appears almost incredible. Grown weary of theology, he\r\ndirected his attention to law, philology, natural philosophy, medicine,\r\nand elegant literature; and he pursued all these studies without any\r\nregular order. It is probable that at this period he injured his sight\r\nby indefatigable reading; for in the prime of life he was incapable of\r\ndistinguishing any object at the distance of three paces, without the\r\naid of glasses. But neither this infirmity nor the crooked legs which\r\nhe had received from nature, deterred him from mingling in fashionable\r\nsociety. His figure, which was in other respects strong and well\r\nproportioned, joined to his prepossessing countenance, contributed in\r\nno slight degree to the early developement of his self-esteem.\r\n\r\nQuevedo returned to the court of Madrid, with a mind stored with\r\nall kinds of academic knowledge. But he soon became engaged in a\r\ndispute, fought a duel in which he wounded his antagonist, and was\r\ncompelled to fly. He proceeded to Italy, where the Spanish Viceroy of\r\nNaples, Don Pedro Giron, Duke of Ossuna, interested himself for the\r\naccomplished fugitive. He procured his pardon at Madrid, and retained\r\nhim in his service at Naples. Quevedo now became a statesman and a man\r\nof business. He played the most prominent part at the court of the\r\nVice-king, executed important commissions, visited the papal court,\r\nin quality of ambassador, was rewarded with titles and pensions, and\r\nseemed to be the favourite of fortune. But he was suddenly cast down\r\nby the fall of his patron, the Duke of Ossuna. Quevedo was connected\r\nwith that powerful grandee in all his transactions, and thus became\r\ninvolved in his fate. In 1620, in the fortieth year of his age, he was\r\narrested and removed to his country seat, La Torre de Juan Abad, where\r\nhe was, by the order of the government, confined during three years,\r\nnotwithstanding his delicate state of health, which this restraint\r\nrendered daily worse. So rigidly was this kind of imprisonment\r\nenforced, that it was with great difficulty he could obtain leave to go\r\nto a neighbouring town to commit himself to the care of a physician in\r\nwhom he could confide.\r\n\r\nAt length Quevedo’s papers being strictly examined, his innocence\r\nbecame unquestionable, and he was set at liberty. He now demanded\r\nindemnification and the payment of the arrears of his pension. Instead,\r\nhowever, of obtaining attention to his claims, he was threatened with\r\na new exile, and received an order to quit the court. This sentence he\r\nfound means to evade, and even court intrigue seemed at last inclined\r\nto favour him; but in the conflict between vanity and reason, Quevedo\r\nin due time proved himself a philosopher. He willingly forsook the\r\ncourt, retired to his estate of La Torre, and devoted himself wholly\r\nto literary pursuits. It is probable that at this period he wrote the\r\npoems which on their first appearance were published as the works of\r\nthe Bachelor de la Torre, an old poet of the fifteenth century. The\r\nname of his country residence apparently suggested to Quevedo the\r\ndisguise of the above title. There is also reason to suppose that at\r\nthis period he wrote the greater portion of his works both in prose\r\nand verse. But these writings, which overflow with wit and satire, and\r\ndisplay that firmness of judgment and character, which is always so\r\nunwelcome at courts, tended to keep alive the attention of those who\r\nconceived themselves to be attacked. As the crisis of his varied fate\r\napproached, Quevedo seems to have totally forgotten the intrigues of\r\nwhich he had been the victim. He had already passed several years in\r\nliterary tranquillity, and was upwards of fifty years of age when he\r\nmarried. But his wife, to whom he was tenderly attached, did not live\r\nlong. Quevedo’s evil star once more induced him to visit Madrid, where\r\nin 1641, he was arrested at midnight in the house of a friend with\r\nwhom he resided. The charge preferred against him, was that of being a\r\nlibeller, who spared neither the government nor public morals; he was\r\nthrown into a small and unwholesome prison, and treated with the most\r\nrigid severity, not even experiencing the humanity usually extended to\r\nthe vilest criminals. In the meanwhile his property was sequestrated,\r\nand though not convicted of any crime, he was compelled to subsist on\r\ncharity. He was again seized with a severe fit of illness. His body\r\nbroke out in ulcers, in consequence of the insalubrity of his prison,\r\nbut he was even then denied the aid of a surgeon. In this situation\r\nQuevedo appealed for justice to the Duke of Olivares, the all-powerful\r\nprime minister of Spain, in a letter which has become celebrated. His\r\ncase was now, for the first time, strictly investigated; and it was\r\nascertained that he had merely been supposed to be the author of a\r\nlibel, which was subsequently discovered to have been written in a\r\nmonastery. Quevedo once more regained his freedom, but with the loss\r\nof a considerable portion of his fortune, of which indeed he retained\r\nso scanty a remnant, that he was unable to continue long enough in\r\nMadrid to solicit the indemnification which was so justly due to him,\r\nand without which he could not subsist with respectability. A prey\r\nto sickness, and deprived of the hope of ever obtaining justice, he\r\nretired to his country seat, and there died in the year 1645.\r\n\r\nA man who, like Quevedo, reaped the bitterest fruits from political\r\njustice, cannot be very heavily reproached for seizing in his\r\nsatires every opportunity of more severely chastising and ridiculing\r\nthe ministers of that justice, than any other enemies of truth\r\nand equity. But Quevedo was not a mere satirist. He may, without\r\nhesitation, be pronounced the most ingenious of all Spanish writers,\r\nnext to Cervantes; and his mind was, moreover, endowed with a degree\r\nof practical judgment, which is seldom found combined with that\r\nversatility for which he was distinguished. Could Quevedo have ruled\r\nthe taste and genius of his nation and his age in the same degree in\r\nwhich that taste and genius influenced him, his versatility, joined\r\nto his talent for composing verses with no less rapidity than Lope\r\nde Vega, might have rendered him, if not a poet of the first rank\r\nin the loftier region of art, at least a classic writer of almost\r\nunrivalled merit. But this scholar and man of the world was too early\r\nwedded to conventional forms of every kind. It may indeed be said that\r\nhe was steeped in all the colours of his age. A true feeling of the\r\nindependence of genius never animated him, lofty as his spirit in other\r\nrespects was. His taste imbibed some portion of all the conflicting\r\ntastes which at that period existed in Spain. His style never acquired\r\noriginality, and his mind was only half cultivated.\r\n\r\nQuevedo’s writings, taken altogether in verse and in prose, resemble\r\na massy ornament of jewellery, in which the setting of some parts is\r\nexquisitely skilful, of others extremely rude, and in which the number\r\nof false stones and of gems of inestimable value are nearly equal.\r\nHis most numerous, and unquestionably his best productions, are those\r\nof the satirical and comic kind. Though Quevedo did not strike into a\r\ntotally new course, yet by a union peculiar to himself of sports of\r\nfancy, with the maxims of reason and morality, he evidently enlarged\r\nthe sphere of satirical and comic poetry in Spanish literature. He\r\noccasionally approached, though he never equalled, the delicacy and\r\ncorrectness of Cervantes. His wit is sufficiently caustic; but it is\r\naccompanied by a coarseness which would be surprising, considering\r\nhis situation in life, were it not that Quevedo, as an author,\r\nsought to indemnify himself for the constraint to which, as a man\r\nof the world he was compelled to submit. For this reason, perhaps,\r\nhe bestowed but little pains on the correction of his satires. His\r\nideas are striking; and are thrown together sometimes with absolute\r\ncarelessness, sometimes with refined precision; but for the most part\r\nin a distorted and mannered strain of language. This mixed character\r\nof cultivation and rudeness peculiarly characterizes his satirical and\r\ncomic works in verse, in which, as he himself says, he has exhibited\r\n“truth in her smock, but not quite naked.”[478] He appears as the\r\nrival of Gongora in numerous comic canciones and romances in the old\r\nnational style.[479] In these compositions he humorously parodied the\r\nextravagant images of the Marinists,[480] and the affected singularity\r\nof the Gongorists.[481] Quevedo wrote no inconsiderable number of his\r\ncomic and satirical poems in the jargon of the Spanish gypsies; and it\r\nis therefore probable that they are not intelligible to many readers on\r\nthis side of the Pyrenees.[482] These romances and canciones, which\r\nwere distinguished by the name of Xacaras, were rendered so extremely\r\npopular by Quevedo, that even down to the present day the Spaniards\r\ncontinue to admire them.[483] His Bayles, or comic dancing songs, are,\r\non account of their numerous allusions to national peculiarities, no\r\nless obscure to foreigners than the Xacaras.\r\n\r\nOf all the Spanish poets, Quevedo has been the most successful writer\r\nof burlesque sonnets in the Italian manner. Some of these sonnets he\r\nshortened by depriving them of the three last of their legitimate\r\nnumber of lines, while the Italians on the contrary, attached to\r\ntheirs the comic sequel which they called the _Coda_.[484] Quevedo’s\r\nproductions in this class are, for the most part, like their Italian\r\nmodels, full of allusions which cannot be understood without the\r\nassistance of a commentary. Some have a piquant sententious turn. But\r\nthat licentious humour which distinguishes this species of composition\r\nin Italian literature Quevedo renounced, either voluntarily or from\r\nfear of the inquisition. Besides his burlesque sonnets, he wrote\r\ncanciones and madrigals in the same style.\r\n\r\nQuevedo’s satires in the manner of Juvenal, naturally connect\r\nthemselves with his burlesque poems. Like his model he has infused\r\ninto them nearly as much poetry as the satirical style is capable of\r\nreceiving.[485] These compositions display the noblest enthusiasm for\r\ntruth and justice,[486] and the most patriotic zeal for the honour of\r\nSpain,[487] forcibly and clearly expressed.\r\n\r\nQuevedo’s satires in verse and his poems of humour, are not so well\r\nknown out of Spain as his prose writings of the same description, of\r\nwhich the most remarkable are his Visions or Dreams, and his novel of\r\nthe Great Tacaño, or the Captain of Thieves, called Don Pablos, (_Vida\r\ndel Buscon_, llamado D. Pablos), which certainly may be regarded as\r\nthe most burlesque of the knavery romances.[488] Lucian furnished him\r\nwith the original idea of satirical visions; but Quevedo’s were the\r\nfirst of their kind in modern literature. Owing to frequent imitations,\r\ntheir faults are now no longer disguised by the charm of novelty, and\r\neven their merits have ceased to interest. Still, however, they must\r\nbe regarded as ingenious productions abounding in practical truths.\r\nThey are not, it is true, remarkable either for delicate satire or\r\npure philosophy. But Quevedo’s object was to scourge human folly and\r\nvice in the mass; and the severe lashes which he deals out in his\r\nVisions, are in excellent unison with the popular nature of the idea\r\nand the poignant style of its execution. He has made perverted Justice,\r\nwith all her servants and satellites, and particularly the Alguazils,\r\nfigure in the fore ground of his picture; but the melancholy fate of\r\nthe author may well excuse, though even in the visionary world, these\r\nmonotonous features in his satirical work. Among the passages for\r\nwhich no just excuse can be found, are some disgusting descriptions\r\nof the consequences of physical excess. The reader is occasionally\r\nsurprised by the humorous sallies with which Quevedo breaks forth in\r\nthese Visions; for example, in that of the Last Judgment, in which\r\nhe describes “some merchants who had placed their souls across their\r\nbodies, so that their five senses got into the finger nails of their\r\nright hand.[489]”\r\n\r\nFor the serious works of Quevedo, we must refer to his poems, as his\r\nserious compositions in prose are in general of a theological and\r\nascetic character. The sonnets, canciones, odes and pastoral poems,\r\nwhich he published under the name of the Bachelor de la Torre, are even\r\nat the present day highly extolled by critics;[490] and these poems\r\nhave certainly more correctness than most of Quevedo’s other works. But\r\nthey chiefly consist of imitations of the Spanish Petrarchist style,\r\nwhich was always foreign to Quevedo; and notwithstanding the great\r\nelegance of language and versification which distinguish them, they are\r\nsurcharged with antiquated phrases of affected gallantry. The _snows_\r\nwhich _inflame_ the poet, and similar tropes in which the beauty of\r\na mistress is brilliantly set forth, occasionally call to mind the\r\nstyle of the Italian Marinists. Nevertheless some of these sonnets well\r\ndeserve the favour which has been extended to them.[491] Quevedo’s\r\n_Endechas_, or Laments, have a pleasing national character.[492] The\r\npastoral poems contained in this collection, approximate to the good\r\nspecimens of the sixteenth century. Quevedo evidently wished to prove\r\nwhat he was capable of producing in this style of composition.\r\n\r\nThe serious poems of which Quevedo has avowed himself the author, are\r\nvery unequal in character.[493] His didactic and sententious sonnets\r\nare energetic, but deficient in delicacy.[494] Some of the best assume\r\na satirical turn.[495] His odes in the Pindaric style are, however,\r\nstiff and formal. He wrote a piece of moral declamation in verse,\r\ncalled _Sermon Estoyco_, (Estoical Sermon), which is in truth precisely\r\nwhat the title denotes.\r\n\r\nThat Quevedo entertained very vague notions respecting poetry, is\r\nparticularly evident from the whim which induced him to translate in\r\nrhymed verse, the stoical Enchiridion, or Manual of Epictetus. The\r\ntranslation is, however, much esteemed by the Spaniards.[496]\r\n\r\n\r\nVILLEGAS.\r\n\r\nAn Anacreon was still wanting to Spanish literature, though various\r\nattempts in the Anacreontic style had been made. That a poet penetrated\r\nat once with the classic spirit of Anacreon, Horace and Catullus,\r\nshould now arise, and become the favourite of the Spanish public,\r\nwas a thing scarcely to be expected; for all the resources of amatory\r\npoetry in the only style which had hitherto been found agreeable to\r\nSpanish taste, seemed to be exhausted. The poetry of Villegas, however,\r\nproduced precisely for this reason the more powerful impression on a\r\npublic which ardently longed for entertainment.\r\n\r\nEstèvan Manuel de Villègas, was born in the year 1595, at Nagera,\r\nor Naxera, a little town in Old Castile. The history of his life is\r\nsimple. His parents who were noble, though not rich, sent him to\r\nstudy at Madrid and Salamanca. His taste for poetry was developed\r\nat a very early period. Even in his fifteenth year he translated\r\nAnacreon, and several of the odes of Horace in verse; and likewise\r\nimitated those poets in original compositions. In his twentieth year\r\nhe gave the finishing touch to his youthful effusions, and added to\r\nthe collection of his translated and original poems, a second part,\r\nwhich has since been published conjointly with them.[497] He soon\r\nafter printed the whole collection at his own expence at Naxera, under\r\nthe title of _Amatorias_; but in the interior of the book, the poems\r\nare styled _Eroticas_.[498] Villegas ventured to dedicate these\r\npoems, together with the part added to them, to which a particular\r\ntitle might more properly have been assigned, to Philip III. though\r\nindividual parts of the collection had previously been addressed to\r\nother patrons. That so indolent a monarch as Philip III. should have\r\naccepted the dedication of such a collection, may not be surprising,\r\nand the freedom was pardonable in a young author of three-and-twenty.\r\nBut this dedication is, in another respect, remarkable in the history\r\nof Spanish literature; for the _Eroticas_ of Villegas contain some\r\npassages, which though not wanting in delicacy of expression, are\r\nnevertheless so extremely free, that it is wonderful how they happened\r\nto escape the censure of the inquisition. The dedication was, however,\r\nproductive of neither good nor evil to the poet. For several years he\r\nvainly solicited a lucrative office; and was at last obliged to content\r\nhimself with the scanty emolument arising from an insignificant post in\r\nNaxera, his native town. From that time he devoted his leisure to the\r\ncomposition of philological works in the latin language; and though he\r\nproduced nothing new for Spanish poetry, he made a prose translation of\r\nfive books of Boethius. He lived till the year 1669.\r\n\r\nThe graceful luxuriance of the poetry of Villegas has no parallel in\r\nmodern literature; and, generally speaking, no modern writer has\r\nso well succeeded in blending the spirit of ancient poetry with the\r\nmodern. But constantly to observe that correctness of ideas, which\r\ndistinguished the classical compositions of antiquity, was by Villegas,\r\nas by most Spanish poets, considered too rigid a requisition, and an\r\nunnecessary restraint on genius. He accordingly sometimes degenerates\r\ninto conceits and images, the monstrous absurdity of which are\r\ncharacteristic of the author’s nation and age. For instance, in one\r\nof his odes in which he entreats Lyda to suffer her tresses to flow,\r\nhe says, that “when agitated by Zephyr, her locks would occasion a\r\nthousand deaths, and subdue a thousand lives;”[499] and then he adds,\r\nin a strain of extravagance, surpassing that of the Marinists, “that\r\nthe sun himself would cease to give light, if he did not snatch beams\r\nfrom her radiant countenance to illumine the east.”[500] But faults of\r\nthis glaring kind, are by no means frequent in the poetry of Villegas;\r\nand the fascinating grace with which he emulates his models, operates\r\nwith so powerful a charm, that the occasional occurrence of some little\r\naffectations, from which he could scarcely be expected entirely to\r\nabstain, is easily overlooked by the reader.\r\n\r\nThe order in which the poetic works of Villegas are arranged, is\r\nby no means the best; but as it was chosen by the author, it is\r\nproper that it should be observed in pursuing a notice of the poems\r\nthemselves. The first book of the first part commences with thirty-six\r\nodes in the style of some of the odes of Horace. The Dedicatory Ode\r\naddressed to the king, announces, in language truly charming, the\r\nspirit of the whole collection.[501] Then follow in a similar strain,\r\nthe most delightful plays of fancy, abounding in classical allusions,\r\nwithout the least trace of pedantry. The style of Villegas even\r\nimparts a charm of novelty to descriptions of the oftenest described\r\nthings.[502] In these odes, romantic levity assumes freedoms, which\r\nif not always of the most excusable, are invariably of the most\r\ngraceful description;[503] and the soft and melodious expression of\r\ntender passion, which in more than one instance occurs, has never been\r\nsurpassed.[504]\r\n\r\nThe second book of the first division of the poems of Villegas,\r\nconsists of odes, which are free translations of the first book of\r\nHorace. It ought not, therefore, to have been ranked under the same\r\ntitle with the other poems in the collection. There is something\r\npedantic in the generical titles by which he distinguishes the\r\ndifferent odes; for example--_Memptica_, _Enetica_, _Parænetica_, &c.\r\n\r\nWith the third book of the first division commence the Anacreontic\r\nsongs, or as they are styled in the collection, the _Delicias_ of\r\nthe poet. Their measure is chiefly anacreontic, sometimes in blank\r\nverse, and at other times presenting the most pleasing alternation\r\nof rhymes and assonances. Light pleasing images and soft luxuriant\r\nideas float through these songs even more gracefully than in the odes\r\nattributed to Anacreon.[505] Nothing can exceed the beauty of those\r\nin which a certain delicate moral feeling is combined with a pathetic\r\nsimplicity.[506] Only a few can be said to be absolutely copied from\r\nthe greek or latin originals.\r\n\r\nThe fourth book of the first part, contains the complete translation of\r\nthe greek odes ascribed to Anacreon. The second division is chiefly\r\noccupied with elegies and idyls, or _eidillios_, as Villegas, in\r\nhellenizing the term, chooses to call them. The elegies which might\r\nwith greater propriety be denominated epistles, do not belong to the\r\nbest of the kind in Spanish literature; in the idyls, or mythological\r\ntales, as they ought to be called, Villegas appears as one of the\r\n_Cultoristos_, or disciples of the school of Gongora.[507]\r\n\r\nThe collection concludes with several imitations of greek and latin\r\nverse, which may be regarded as the first compositions of the kind\r\nin Spanish, that were not complete failures. Doubtless the Spanish\r\nlanguage adapts itself somewhat more readily to the ancient metres\r\nthan the Italian; for final syllables sounded in pronunciation, but\r\nsubject to elision in scanning, do not occur so frequently in Spanish\r\nas in Italian.--This difference is, however, in reality but of trivial\r\nimportance; and Spanish verses in the ancient syllabic measures do\r\nnot flow much more naturally than the Italian compositions of the\r\nsame kind; because many words derived from the latin, have received\r\nin Spanish, as well as in Italian, a modern quantity,[508] which is\r\ngenerally confounded with the ancient quantity by the imitators of the\r\ngreek and latin metres. The Spanish hexameters of Villegas, it is true,\r\napproach in point of facility to the hexameters of antiquity.[509]\r\nBut the pentameters defied his imitative talent.[510] In his sapphic\r\nverse the measure resolves into iambics: one of these sapphic odes is,\r\nhowever, exquisitely beautiful.[511]\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY OF LYRIC, BUCOLIC, EPIC, DIDACTIC,\r\n    AND SATIRICAL POETRY, TO THE CLOSE OF THE PERIOD EMBRACED BY THIS\r\n    SECTION.\r\n\r\nAfter Quevedo and Villegas, and before entering upon the notice of a\r\nseries of dramatic poets, whose works must form a subject of separate\r\nconsideration, it will be necessary to mention several ingenious\r\nwriters, who, though endowed with eminent talents, were nevertheless\r\nunable to retard the fast approaching close of the golden era of\r\nSpanish poesy.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUREGUI.\r\n\r\nIf pure diction, joined to a descriptive style of the most perfect\r\nkind, might form a sufficient claim to the title of poet of the first\r\nrank, the right of Juan de Jauregui, or Xauregui, to that distinction,\r\namong the Spanish poets of the first half of the seventeenth century,\r\ncould not be disputed. Jauregui, who was of Biscayan origin, but\r\neducated in the interior of Spain, first developed his talents in\r\nItaly. In that country he prosecuted his poetic studies, and at\r\nthe same time thought it no degradation to practise painting as a\r\nprofession, though he was a nobleman and a knight of the order of\r\nCalatrava. He is said to have excelled in painting even more than\r\nin poetry. While in Italy he made a Spanish translation of Tasso’s\r\nAmynta, in which he was so successful, that the translation is still\r\nregarded by the educated portion of his countrymen as possessing the\r\ncharacteristics of the happiest original composition. Jauregui was a\r\ndecided opponent of the Gongorists; but his taste did not coincide\r\nwith that of Quevedo. He devoted much talent and industry to a free\r\ntranslation of Lucan’s Pharsalia in octaves. He died in 1610; and\r\nhis poetic remains, exclusive of his translations, are by no means\r\nnumerous. The translation of Lucan was not published till long after\r\nthe death of Jauregui; but ever since its appearance, the Spaniards\r\nhave admired it as a classic composition; and it unquestionably\r\npossesses all the merit that the translation of such a work can\r\npossibly present. But from a man who could be induced to apply so much\r\nlabour and time to a translation of Lucan, no very extraordinary\r\nproofs of poetic talent were to be expected; and it must be confessed\r\nthat Jauregui, in none of his compositions has risen above what may\r\nbe called the poetry of style. He might have carried this kind of\r\nmerit still farther, had not his Lucan led him into a kind of mannered\r\naffectation. Among his original works, his _Orfeo_, a mythological\r\ntale, in five cantos, deserves to be distinguished.[512] But his lyric\r\npoems, and particularly his sonnets, bear evident traces of the man of\r\ngenius and of cultivated mind.[513] Jauregui’s dramatic compositions,\r\nwhich were written with the view of reforming the national taste,\r\nare now lost to literature, and were at the time of their production\r\nindignantly banished from the stage. He is the author of some small\r\nworks in prose, one of which is a treatise on painting.[514]\r\n\r\n\r\nBORJA Y ESQUILLACHE.\r\n\r\nPrince Francisco de Borja y Esquillache, a knight of the Golden Fleece,\r\nand for some time viceroy of Peru, was the most distinguished, in\r\npoint of birth, of all the Spanish poets of his age.[515] With regard\r\nto cultivation, he may be placed on a level with Jauregui; but he\r\ndeserves to rank higher in poetic invention. Throughout his long life,\r\nwhich when he died in 1658, had extended to nearly eighty years, he\r\nseems constantly to have devoted a portion of his time to the study\r\nof poetry; and though he was not entitled to the praises lavished on\r\nhim by his flatterers, who styled him the Prince of Spanish Poets,\r\nhe may be regarded as the last representative of the classic style\r\nof the sixteenth century. The collection of his sonnets, epistles,\r\ntales, romances, and canciones, forms a large quarto volume, the last\r\nhalf of which is printed in double columns.[516] Prince Francisco de\r\nBorja, was likewise the author of an unsuccessful epic poem, entitled,\r\n_Napoles Conquistada_, and various works on sacred subjects. Though he\r\ndid not contribute to the advancement of Spanish poetry, yet in all\r\nhis writings, he decidedly opposed that subtlety and affectation which\r\nin the time of Gongora usurped the place of real genius. The intimate\r\nfriendship he had contracted in his youth with the younger Argensola,\r\nhad no doubt a favourable influence on the early developement of his\r\ntalent. In the preface to his poems, which is in verse, he explains\r\nthe principles of his taste with so much accuracy, modesty and\r\nelegance, that the reader cannot fail to be prepossessed in his favour,\r\nbefore entering on an attentive perusal of his works.[517] He was\r\nparticularly averse to all kinds of affectation and extravagance.[518]\r\nMost of his sonnets bear traces of mature reflection.[519] His long\r\ntale of Jacob and Rachel, (_Cantos de Jacob y Raquel_), in octaves, has\r\nindeed no other merit than that of elegant diction.[520] His lyric\r\nromances, however, of which he wrote upwards of two hundred and fifty,\r\npresent at once the richest and most beautiful gleanings in that\r\nspecies of poetic composition.[521]\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER POETS OF THIS PERIOD--THE SYLVAS, OR POETIC FORESTS.\r\n\r\nTo enter into a detailed description of the works of some other\r\nSpanish poets, with whom the old national poetry and the Italian style\r\nequally perished, would be the more unnecessary here, as these poets,\r\nthough not without genius, wanted proper cultivation, and merely\r\nfollowed in the general stream. Besides, there is no want of literary\r\nnotices which furnish abundant information respecting Luis de Ulloa,\r\nFrancisco de Rioja, Gravina, Manuel de Mela, Juan de Tarsis, Count of\r\nVillamediana, and others.[522] It is, however, worthy of remark, that\r\nat this period, as in the preceding ages, Spanish noblemen and men of\r\nrank were particularly distinguished among the candidates for poetic\r\nfame. The Poetic Forests, (_Sylvas_), as they were styled, according\r\nto Gongora’s nomenclature, but which were afterwards designated by the\r\ncommon Spanish word _Selvas_, doubtless contributed in no slight degree\r\nto hasten the decline of genuine poetry in Spain. In these Forests\r\nrhymed prose could flow on without obstruction, and every conceit was\r\nin its proper place; for no fixed metre, and no unity of ideas or\r\nevents restrained the poet or versifier. The works of Count Rebolledo,\r\nwhich are deserving of a particular notice, will afford a sufficient\r\nidea of the direction thus given to the lyric, didactic, narrative, and\r\nbucolic poetry of Spain, in a general combination of all these styles.\r\n\r\n\r\nREBOLLEDO.\r\n\r\nBernardino, Count of Rebolledo, was one of the heroes of the latter\r\nperiod of the thirty years war in Germany. After having distinguished\r\nhimself in the military service both of Spain and Austria, he resided\r\nfor a considerable time in the quality of Spanish ambassador at\r\nCopenhagen, where he watched over the interests of his sovereign with\r\nreference to the designs of the king of Sweden. His taste for military\r\nand political affairs did not preclude the exercise of his talent for\r\npoetry. But it was not until his mission to Copenhagen, when he had\r\nattained the age of maturity, that he found leisure to prosecute his\r\npoetic studies with assiduity. Thus, for the first time, and perhaps\r\nfor the last, was Spanish poetry in the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, transplanted to Scandanavia. Count Rebolledo was much pleased\r\nwith his residence in Copenhagen; and he rendered signal service to\r\nhis Danish majesty, when Charles Gustavus, King of Sweden, marched\r\nacross the frozen Belt, and bombarded the Danish capital. Though a\r\nzealous catholic, he felt for the royal house of Denmark a kind of\r\npersonal devotion, which he seized every opportunity of manifesting,\r\nboth in verse and prose. He took particular interest in the study of\r\nthe history and geography of Denmark, with the view of describing\r\nthem in Spanish verse. Having returned to his native country, where\r\nhe was appointed minister of war, he died in 1676, in the eightieth\r\nyear of his age. His poems were, during his life, collected and\r\npublished under various titles.[523] One of these collections, entitled\r\n_Ocios_, (Leisure Hours), proves that Count Rebolledo, though he only\r\ntravelled in a long beaten tract, and even in that tract did not\r\nshine above his contemporaries, possessed, nevertheless, a degree of\r\npoetic cultivation, which was probably unparalleled in Copenhagen in\r\nthe age in which he lived. He was particularly successful as a writer\r\nof elegant madrigals;[524] and he is the author of a play, entitled,\r\n_Amor Despreciando Riesgos_,[525] (Love Dreads no Danger), which\r\npossesses considerable interest. But Rebolledo’s name has been rendered\r\nstill more remarkable in the history of Spanish literature by his dull\r\nForests, for which he himself claimed the title of poetic, though\r\nthey exhibit only the last traces of Spanish poetry. Other writers\r\nhad already done their utmost to give importance to the rhymed prose\r\nof these Forests. But Rebolledo so completely mistook the essence of\r\npoetry, that he really conceived he was executing works of high poetic\r\nmerit, when he put into verse a compendium of the History and Geography\r\nof Denmark, entitled, _Selvas Danicas_, and a treatise on the Art of\r\nWar and State Policy, entitled, _Selva Militar y Politica_. Whoever\r\nattempts to travel through Rebolledo’s Danish Forests, will soon find,\r\nespecially if he have any recollection of genuine Spanish poetry, that\r\nhe has undertaken a very disagreeable task. In the first half of the\r\nwork, not a single poetic or even ingenious trait enlivens the dry\r\nenumeration of facts. What the author intended for a narrative poem,\r\nis found to be merely an account of the History of Denmark, related in\r\nthe lowest style of common place prose; and the multitude of northern\r\nnames, which partly retain their original spelling, and are partly\r\nhispanized, have a peculiarly grotesque effect.[526] The geography of\r\nDenmark, which constitutes the second part of the work, presents a few\r\npoetic passages.[527] But the Military and Political Forest, which is\r\nintended for a didactic poem, is rhymed prose from beginning to end.\r\nIt is difficult to say whether the principles of tactics,[528] or the\r\ninstructions in the art of government,[529] appear most ridiculous in\r\nthe versified garb in which Rebolledo has clothed them. The worthy\r\nauthor might with more propriety have applied the title of poems to\r\nhis _Selvas Sagradas_, (Sacred Forests), which are translations of the\r\npsalms in the loose forms of the Forests.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY OF THE SPANISH DRAMA.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of regret with which the decay of Spanish poetry in the age\r\nof Rebolledo is beheld, yields to the agreeable surprize which arises\r\non taking a retrospective view of the Spanish drama, the history of\r\nwhich must now be continued to the close of the present period. The\r\nhistory of the Spanish drama should properly be studied as a whole;\r\nbut that combined mode of viewing the subject was not compatible\r\nwith a synchronous account of all the remarkable productions of the\r\npolite literature of Spain. Having, however, in connexion with Lope de\r\nVega, spoken of Virues, Montalvan, and others, it will, at least, be\r\nconvenient not to separate the series of dramatic poets, who emulated\r\nor imitated Calderon.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALDERON.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the history of Spanish poetry a writer occurs, whose name\r\ndeserves to be transmitted to the latest posterity, and who flourished\r\nalong with others who are also worthy of honourable remembrance.\r\n\r\nPedro Calderon de la Barca, descended of a noble family, was born in\r\nthe year 1600. He is said to have written his first dramatic work\r\nbefore he had completed his fourteenth year. Having finished his\r\ncollegial studies at an early age, he, according to the custom of\r\nthe times, attached himself to some patrons whom he found among the\r\nnobility at the court of Madrid. Not satisfied, however, with this\r\nmeans of introducing himself to the great world, he became a soldier,\r\nand served in several campaigns in Italy and the Netherlands. Meanwhile\r\nthe fame of his talents as a dramatic poet was widely spread; and it\r\nwas foretold that he would equal, if not exceed, Lope de Vega. King\r\nPhilip IV. who afforded more liberal encouragement to the drama than\r\nany of his predecessors, and who was himself the author of several\r\nplays, was gratified by the idea that he had in Calderon a man capable\r\nof giving splendour to the court theatre. He called him to Madrid in\r\nthe year 1636, and shortly after invested him with the order of St.\r\nIago. From this period Calderon became permanently fixed at court, and\r\nhis young sovereign, whose chief attention was devoted to amusements\r\nand festivities, kept him in constant activity. No expence was spared\r\nin bestowing pomp and brilliancy on the pieces which Calderon produced\r\nfor the entertainment of the court; but on the other hand, it was\r\nexpected of him to accommodate his genius to the conditions required\r\nby a courtly audience. Nevertheless his taste was consulted in the\r\narrangement of all public festivities, and the triumphal arch through\r\nwhich the Queen Maria of Austria made her public entrance into Spain,\r\nwas erected in conformity with his suggestions.\r\n\r\nIn his fifty-second year Calderon took holy orders, but did not on\r\nthat account totally relinquish his previous occupations. From that\r\ntime, however, he applied himself with more particular assiduity to\r\nthe composition of his _Autos Sacramentales_, which soon superseded\r\nthroughout the whole of Spain all the older dramas of this class.\r\nCalderon lived to an advanced age, admired by his countrymen, and amply\r\nrewarded by ecclesiastical dignities, pensions and presents, from his\r\nsovereign. In the estimation of the public, his dramas surpassed those\r\nof every preceding and contemporary writer. But in his old age, he\r\nhimself attached but little importance to his temporal productions. The\r\nDuke of Veragua addressed to him a flattering letter, requesting to be\r\nfurnished with a complete list of his dramas, because the booksellers\r\nwere in the habit of selling the works of other writers under his name.\r\nIn reply, Calderon, who was then in his eightieth year, supplied the\r\nduke only with the list of his _Autos Sacramentales_. He added in a\r\nletter, that with regard to his temporal dramas, he felt offended, that\r\nin addition to his own faulty works, those of other authors should\r\nbe circulated in his name; and besides that, his writings were so\r\naltered that he himself could not recognize even their titles. He also\r\nexpressed his determination to follow the example of the booksellers,\r\nand to pay as little regard to his plays as they did; but he observed,\r\nthat on religious grounds he attached more importance to his Autos.[530]\r\n\r\nCalderon died in 1687, in the eighty-seventh year of his age. Several\r\ncollections of his dramas appeared during his life, and among the rest\r\none published by his brother, Joseph Calderon, in 1640, but none were\r\nedited by the author himself. In the great edition of the collected\r\ncomedies of Calderon, which his friend Juan de Vera Tassis y Villaroel\r\nbegan to superintend in 1685, the poet, who was then eighty-five years\r\nof age, can scarcely be expected to have indirectly participated\r\neven so far as was necessary to certify the authenticity of the\r\ncomponent parts. It is therefore questionable whether the hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven plays, published in Calderon’s name, be all genuine. This\r\ndoubt may indeed be hazarded with the greater probability, as Juan\r\nde Vera Tassis, who undertook to publish the complete collection of\r\nCalderon’s dramas, estimates the number of his Autos at ninety-five;\r\nwhile Calderon himself, in his conscientious list furnished to the\r\nDuke of Veragua, states their number to be only sixty-eight, including\r\nthose not printed. It can scarcely be believed that Calderon wrote\r\ntwenty-seven Autos after he had attained the age of eighty.[531]\r\n\r\nOn a comparison of the dramas of Calderon and Lope de Vega, it requires\r\nno extraordinary critical penetration to discover the essential\r\nservices which the former rendered to the dramatic literature of Spain.\r\nWhich of these writers possessed the greater share of inventive talent,\r\nis a question which it would be difficult to determine, for Lope de\r\nVega was not the inventor of that species of dramatic composition\r\nwhich was common to both, and Calderon was not behind him in the\r\ninvention of new combinations of intrigue, ingenious complexities of\r\nplot, and interesting situations. In general the invention of Lope\r\nmay be the bolder, but it is also the more rude of the two; and with\r\nregard to whatever may be called refinement, whether in conception or\r\nexecution, but more particularly in style, Calderon formed for himself\r\nan entirely new sphere. The delicate art with which he gave the last\r\npolish to the Spanish drama, without changing its nature, carries with\r\nit an ennobling dignity in some of his historical, or, as they are\r\nstyled, heroic comedies. In his comedies of intrigue this delicacy is\r\nconspicuous in the execution of the general forms of character, which\r\nhad now become naturalized on the Spanish stage, and which usurped\r\nthe place of individuality. Calderon’s comedies are necessarily as\r\nlittle pieces of character as those of Lope de Vega, for with the\r\ndelineation of particular character they would have ceased to be pure\r\ndramas of intrigue. But they abound in characteristic traits, in those\r\ntraits which develope, as it were, out of the souls of the dramatic\r\npersonages, the natural course of the gay intrigue in all its various\r\nmodifications. As an acute observer of the female mind and manners\r\nCalderon was infinitely superior to Lope de Vega. This delicacy of\r\nobservation accords admirably with the almost incredible subtlety\r\nof his combinations of intrigue; and the elegance of his language\r\nand versification complete the ingenious harmony of these apparently\r\nirregular dramas, which though not sufficiently perfect to be regarded\r\nas models, are nevertheless true to the rules which the author\r\nprescribed to himself. The other merits which belong to his dramas,\r\nsuch as the seductive gracefulness and facility of the dialogue,\r\nCalderon shares in common with all the good dramatic writers of Spain.\r\nThe faults with which he may be reproached, and which in some measure\r\nbelong to the species of drama he adopted, are more numerous in some of\r\nhis pieces than in others. It must also be observed, that in some of\r\nhis heroic comedies, he sinks so completely beneath his own standard\r\nthat it is difficult to recognize him.\r\n\r\nIn Calderon’s _Comedias de Capa y Espada_,[532] the plots are usually\r\nof so complicated a nature, that no reader except a Spaniard,\r\nhabituated to this sort of mental exercise,[533] can on a first\r\nperusal seize and follow the various threads of the intrigue, by the\r\nartful entanglement of which the principal characters of the piece are\r\nrepeatedly plunged from one unexpected embarrassment into another.\r\nCalderon particularly excelled in the accumulation of surprises, in\r\nconnecting one difficult situation with another, and in maintaining\r\nundiminished the strongly excited interest to the close of the piece.\r\nBut in order to render this task the easier, he paid still less\r\nattention than Lope de Vega to probability in the succession of the\r\nscenes; and his characters make their entries and their exits just as\r\nit happens to suit the convenience of the poet. The Spanish public\r\nwas, however, disposed to pardon every improbability of this kind,\r\nwhich gave rise to some new situation full of dramatic truth. Calderon\r\nappears to have estimated the merits of his dramas of intrigue, in\r\nproportion to the effect produced by the situations; and in this\r\nrespect he was the more an inventor in proportion as he introduced\r\nthe less variety into his characters. In all Calderon’s comedies of\r\nintrigue, the dramatis personæ are the same individuals under various\r\nnames. Two or three ladies of fashion, two or three lovers, an old\r\nman, a few waiting maids, a few male servants, and among these last,\r\none who acts as the _gracioso_, or buffoon; such are the standing\r\ncharacters with which Calderon usually contented himself in his sphere\r\nof dramatic composition. The motives on which the plot turns are a\r\nlicentious gallantry, in which no moral interest is permitted to mix,\r\nand a point of honour which gives rise to incessant contests. On the\r\nslightest cause of offence swords are drawn, and when passion rages,\r\neven daggers are employed. Romantic accessaries are found in wounds,\r\nand murders, though the latter, it is true, are not quite so frequent\r\nas the former. Among the other passions the fury of jealousy is\r\nconspicuous; and in order to bring this passion into play, the author\r\navails himself of disguises, concealments, mistakes of persons, houses\r\nor letters, and occasionally some particular local circumstance, such\r\nfor instance, as the secret door, which appears to be a cupboard,\r\nin the lively drama of _La Dama Duende_, (The Fairy Lady.) There is\r\nalso no want of night scenes in Calderon’s pieces of intrigue. But\r\nhowever astonishing may be the variety of the situations which he has\r\ncreated out of this uniformity of plan, yet they cannot long satisfy a\r\ncultivated taste which requires a nobler kind of variety.\r\n\r\nHow far Calderon in his _Comedias de Capa y Espada_ has correctly\r\nrepresented the fashionable world of Madrid, as it existed in the\r\nreigns of Philip III. and Philip IV. is a question which cannot now\r\nbe satisfactorily determined. Modern Spanish writers have conceived\r\nthey were pronouncing a judicious critical censure, when they cast on\r\nCalderon’s dramas the reproach of insulting the whole Spanish nation,\r\nby representing it as composed almost solely of romantic coxcombs and\r\nintriguing coquettes. These attacks on Calderon, are the consequence\r\nof inconsiderate zeal for the principles of the French drama, by which\r\nthe dramatic literature of Spain must never be judged.[534] It is\r\nscarcely necessary to observe, that a representation of one class of\r\nmen, who were particularly conspicuous in Madrid, could not be intended\r\nas a representation of the whole Spanish nation. But attempts have\r\nbeen made to depreciate, by still more plausible sophisms, the merits\r\nof Calderon’s sketches of manners. It has been remarked, that he has\r\ntotally violated nature, by putting into the mouths of valets and\r\nwaiting women poetic language, which would be extraordinary even if\r\ndelivered by their masters and mistresses. The Spanish servants of the\r\npresent day are, doubtless, less likely than those of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, to converse in the poetical style in which the servants in\r\nCalderon’s plays, on particular occasions, express themselves. But the\r\nspirit of these particular occasions must not be misunderstood. The\r\nservants in Calderon’s comedies always imitate the language of their\r\nmasters. In most cases they express themselves like the latter, in the\r\nnatural language of real life, and often divested of that colouring\r\nof the ideas, without which a dramatic work ceases to be a poem. But\r\nwhenever romantic gallantry speaks in the language of tenderness,\r\nadmiration, or flattery, then, according to Spanish custom, every idea\r\nbecomes a metaphor; and Calderon, who was a thorough Spaniard, seized\r\nthese opportunities to give the reins to his fancy, and to suffer it\r\nto take a bold lyric flight beyond the boundaries of nature. On such\r\noccasions the most extravagant metaphoric language, in the style of\r\nthe Italian Marinists, did not appear unnatural to a Spanish audience;\r\nand even Calderon himself had for that style a particular fondness,\r\nto the gratification of which he sacrificed a chaster taste. It was\r\nhis ambition to become a more refined Lope de Vega, or a Spanish\r\nMarino. Thus in his play, entitled, _Bien vengas Mal, si vengas Solo_,\r\n(Misfortune comes Well, if it comes Alone), a waiting maid, addressing\r\nher young mistress who has risen in a gay humour, says--“Aurora would\r\nnot have done wrong had she slumbered that morning in her snowy\r\nchrystal, for that the light of her mistress’s charms would suffice to\r\ndraw aside the curtains from the couch of Sol.” She adds that, using a\r\nSpanish idea, “it might then indeed be said that the sun had risen in\r\nher lady’s eyes,”[535] &c. Valets, on the like occasion, speak in the\r\nsame style; and when lovers address compliments to their mistresses,\r\nand these reply in the same strain, the play of far-fetched metaphors\r\nis aggravated by antitheses to a degree which is intolerable to any but\r\na Spanish formed taste.[536] But it must not be forgotten that this\r\nlanguage of gallantry was in Calderon’s time spoken by the fashionable\r\nworld, and that it was a vernacular property of the ancient national\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nFaults of a less pardonable nature in Calderon’s dramas, are the stale\r\njests and meaningless plays on words uttered by servants,[537] and the\r\nburlesque situations to which the disgusting accidents, occasioned by\r\ncertain nocturnal showers from windows give rise. But according to the\r\ntestimony of travellers, such accidents are very common at night in\r\nthe streets of Madrid and Lisbon; and it must be recollected that in\r\nCalderon’s time the jests of servants were considered as indispensable\r\nin a Spanish drama of intrigue, as the presence of the _gracioso_\r\nhimself, who is, for the most part, one of the valets.[538]\r\n\r\nBut the violations of cultivated taste which occur in Calderon’s\r\ncomedies of intrigue, are so amply redeemed, that the critic cannot\r\nlong hesitate to decide whether faults or beauties are most abundant.\r\nSome of these dramas are particularly remarkable for those descriptive\r\nnarratives, by the introduction of which nearly all the Spanish\r\ncomedies of the same class bring to recollection their original\r\nrelationship with novels.[539] Though individual character is wanting,\r\nyet sometimes in the course of the intrigue, beautiful characteristic\r\ntraits unexpectedly occur.[540] The delicacy of the point of honour,\r\nwhich in all these dramas supplies the place of morality, is frequently\r\nexhibited by Calderon in its most brilliant point of view;[541]\r\nand he sometimes with much formality oversteps the Spanish rule, by\r\nwhich moralizing was excluded from this species of drama.[542] The\r\napplication which may be made of the plot is frequently denoted by\r\nthe title of the piece, and is still more distinctly developed at\r\nthe conclusion.[543] Calderon deserves praise for having but seldom\r\nintroduced sonnets in his comedies of intrigue, though he has amply\r\navailed himself of other freedoms, in order to maintain the privilege\r\nof poetry in pourtraying the scenes of common life.[544]\r\n\r\nCalderon’s heroic comedies are much diversified in their kind, and very\r\nunequal in their merits. Some are distinguished from the dramas of\r\nintrigue only by the rank of the characters. Of this kind is the well\r\nknown piece, entitled, _El Secreto a Voces_, (the Published Secret),\r\nimitations of which have appeared in the Italian, French, and German\r\nlanguages. The Spaniards number it among their heroic comedies, merely\r\nbecause an Italian prince and princess are introduced in it. Other\r\nplays by Calderon, which, according to the Spanish nomenclature, are\r\nranked in the heroic class, are in fact romantic pastoral dramas; as\r\nfor example, the pleasing piece, entitled, _Eco y Narciso_. Others\r\nagain are romantic, mythological festival pieces, accompanied by\r\ntransformations and melo-dramatic splendour; of this kind is _El mayor\r\nencanto Amor_, (Love is the greatest Enchantment). Finally, among\r\nCalderon’s heroic comedies are included his historical dramas, several\r\nof which may properly be called tragedies. Some of these historical\r\ndramas are among the best, while others are the most trivial of\r\nCalderon’s productions. All are melo-dramatic spectacles, in which\r\narmies defile, battles are fought, and sumptuous banquets are given.\r\nThe scene is, by turns, a palace, a vast landscape, a cavern, or a\r\npleasure garden, while drums and trumpets flourish, and cannon thunder\r\nat every opportunity.\r\n\r\nIn all that regards scenic splendour in the composition of historical\r\nplays, even Lope de Vega must yield to Calderon, for the dramas of the\r\nlatter were represented at the expence of the royal treasury. But in\r\nthe historical style of dramatic composition Calderon only succeeded\r\nwhen he selected his materials from the events of his own country.\r\nWhere he has adapted to the Spanish stage, subjects from the Greek\r\nand Roman history, as in his Alexander the Great,[545] and in his\r\nCoriolanus,[546] the absurd change of costume is almost forgotten\r\namidst the extravagant confusion of the events, by which romantic\r\nsituations are brought about one after another, but which, on the\r\nwhole, produce only a mean effect. The great poet seems occasionally\r\nto have been forsaken by his good genius, particularly when he makes a\r\ndisplay of his erudition in the very same scenes in which he completely\r\nperverts ancient history. But Calderon’s historical dramas of this\r\nclass are very inferior to those of which the story was invented by\r\nhimself, and the scene arbitrarily laid in ancient Greece. Among the\r\nlatter is a piece, entitled, _Finezas contra Finezas_, (Generosity for\r\nGenerosity), a beautiful poem, full of tenderness and mythological\r\npiety. But this drama, though, perhaps, single in its kind, must\r\nnevertheless yield to the christian drama, of which the history of\r\nPortugal furnishes the hero. The tragedy of Don Fernando, entitled,\r\n_El Principe Constante_, displays all the lustre of Calderon’s genius.\r\nThe unities of time and place are lost sight of in the unity of the\r\nheroic action, into which Calderon has infused the spirit of the purest\r\npathos, without departing from the Spanish national style of heroic\r\ncomedy. This tragedy might not improperly be named the Portuguese\r\nRegulus. Don Fernando, a Portuguese prince, lands at the head of an\r\narmy, accompanied by his brother Don Enrique, on the coast of Barbary\r\nin Morocco. He is victorious in his first battle, and he makes prisoner\r\nthe African hero, Muley, who relates to him his history. The prince,\r\nmoved by generosity, liberates his captive. No sooner has Muley\r\nexpressed his surprise and gratitude, than the Moors return with a\r\nreinforcement, and the Portuguese prince is himself made prisoner. At\r\nthis point commence the tragic scenes which are prepared by pathetic\r\nsituations of another kind. The king of Fez and Morocco immediately\r\noffers liberty to his royal prisoner, on condition of the surrender of\r\nthe garrison of Ceuta on the coast of Morocco, which is in possession\r\nof the Portuguese. The prince declares that he would rather die in\r\nthe most degrading captivity, than consent to obtain his freedom by\r\ndelivering a christian town into the power of the infidels. The moorish\r\nking, however, relies so confidently on the acquisition of Ceuta, that\r\nhe treats the prince with every mark of respect until the return of the\r\nenvoy from Portugal. The answer of the Portuguese government proves to\r\nbe, as the king of Fez expected, a compliance with his proposal; but\r\nthe prince firmly refuses to be ransomed on the required condition. He\r\nnow receives the most rigorous treatment, which he bears with pious\r\nheroism and without complaint, until his bodily strength is exhausted\r\nand he expires. The sufferings and fortitude of Fernando;--the conflict\r\nbetween gratitude and religious prejudice in the mind of Muley, who\r\nexerts his utmost endeavours to deliver the captive prince;--and, on\r\nthe other hand, Muley’s romantic passion for the king’s daughter, who\r\nis destined to be the bride of another;--and the still more romantic\r\ntenderness of the princess,--form altogether a picture so noble and\r\nso truly poetic, that it would be unfair in this brief sketch of the\r\npiece, to notice the numerous errors which it unquestionably presents.\r\nThe action seems to terminate with the death of Fernando; but a fresh\r\narmy arrives from Portugal, and the ghost of the prince, with a\r\ntorch in his hand, appears at the head of the troops and leads them\r\non to victory. The impression produced by this apparition gives the\r\nfinishing touch to the romantic pathos of the foregoing scenes.[547]\r\nThe beautiful flights of fancy which occur at the commencement of the\r\npiece are worthy of particular attention. There Calderon has painted\r\nhis favourite images in his comparison of waves with flowers.[548]\r\nOn another occasion of a similar kind a comparison of stars with\r\nflowers, and of flowers with stars, is introduced in two _concerted_\r\nsonnets.[549] The heroic character of Don Fernando is decidedly evinced\r\nin his first speech to his companions in arms; and his noble spirit is\r\nstill more distinctly developed when he restores Muley to freedom.[550]\r\nBut a more minute detail of the beauties of this tragedy would carry\r\nus beyond the limits of this work.\r\n\r\nCalderon’s _Autos Sacramentales_ may be noticed in a few words. In this\r\nclass of dramatic composition, Calderon pursued the path which had been\r\npreviously trodden by Perez de Montalvan, but he left his model far\r\nbehind him. Some of his autos, of which that entitled, _La Devocion de\r\nla Cruz_, (the Miracles of the Cross, or literally the Devotion of the\r\nCross), may be cited as an example, are the grandest and most ingenious\r\nproductions of the kind in the Spanish language. But in these spiritual\r\ndramas, reason and moral feeling are so perverted by extravagant and\r\nfantastic notions of religious faith, that it is impossible to forbear\r\ncongratulating those nations whose better fate has excluded them from\r\namusements of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE SPANISH DRAMA CONTINUED TO THE CLOSE OF THE PERIOD OF\r\nTHIS SECTION.\r\n\r\nNever, perhaps, was any dramatic poet accompanied in so long a career\r\nby such a number of rivals, friends, and imitators, as Calderon.\r\nIt was precisely the half century during which he indefatigably\r\nlaboured for the Spanish theatre that gave birth to the greater part\r\nof those dramas, the number of which is better known than the merits.\r\nIn consequence of the popularity of Lope de Vega and Calderon, the\r\npassion for dramatic composition became as epidemic in Spain as that of\r\nsonnet writing had formerly been. The encouragement which Philip IV.\r\ngave to the drama, doubtless contributed not a little to excite this\r\npoetic emulation. But the multitude of writers who entered into the\r\ncompetition were ambitious of rivalling Lope de Vega and Calderon in\r\nproofs of fertility of invention. The fecundity of Perez de Montalvan,\r\nwho, notwithstanding his life was short, wrote nearly one hundred plays\r\nin the style of Lope de Vega, was not allowed to remain a solitary\r\nexample. The impression produced by successive _comedias famosas_ on\r\na public whose greatest mental enjoyment was found in the theatre,\r\nwas also felt by those who were desirous of producing similar works.\r\nThus every piece which was applauded sowed the seeds of new comedies.\r\nNo author thought it necessary to reform the principles on which\r\nSpanish comedy was composed, or attempted to distinguish himself by any\r\nparticular originality. At the same time the spirit which governed this\r\nemulation was equally remote from an intentional imitation of the more\r\ncelebrated dramatic poets. He who was ambitious of adding one more to\r\nthe numberless dramas in the possession of the stage, followed in the\r\ngeneral stream under the influence of impressions previously received.\r\nTo wit and fancy free scope was allowed; but any original traits which\r\nthe new production might contain, were more or less overshadowed by\r\nthe general character of this class of composition. The whole of those\r\ndramatists, whose works so closely resemble each other, form therefore\r\nonly one school. Were not the critic assisted by names the most\r\nextensive, knowledge of this department of Spanish literature would in\r\nmost cases be insufficient to enable him to distinguish the labours\r\nof different authors. It often happened that several writers formed a\r\nco-partnership of their talents for the production of one piece. Hence\r\narose the practice of printing on the titles of some dramas, the words,\r\n“by two wits,” or “by three wits,” (_de dos ingenios_, or _de tres\r\ningenios_.) Of the numerous aspirants in this conflict of efforts and\r\nof talents, proportionally few succeeded in obtaining a celebrity which\r\nentitles them to be placed near Lope de Vega and Calderon. These few,\r\nhowever, whose number, compared with the approved dramatists of other\r\nnations, the French comic authors excepted, is still very considerable,\r\nvied in ingenuity and delicacy of composition with Calderon, and\r\nendeavoured to surpass him in regularity.\r\n\r\nSeveral authors have with much labour endeavoured to discover the\r\nnumber of the Spanish dramas, as if the knowledge of their amount even\r\ncorrectly ascertained, could be worth the pains necessary to acquire\r\nit. Of the three thousand eight hundred and fifty-two dramatic works\r\nwhich La Huerta has enumerated,[551] the greater part belongs to the\r\nage of Calderon. Those which Calderon himself wrote, appear in the\r\nlist; and it also includes a considerable number of short interludes,\r\nsome of which, perhaps, did not cost their authors more than a few\r\nhours labour. But this list contains only the printed dramas known to\r\nliterary collectors. That the number of pieces remaining in manuscript\r\nis much greater, may from analogy be presumed; for of the dramatic\r\ncompositions of the idolized Lope de Vega, which are estimated at more\r\nthan two thousand, not many more than three hundred have been printed.\r\n\r\nIt would not be uninteresting to analyze, for the purpose of comparison\r\nwith the works of Calderon, some of the best of the other dramas\r\nof this age; but such details do not fall within the province of\r\nthis General History of Spanish Poetry and Eloquence. Some of the\r\ncontemporaries of Calderon, however, vied with him in so distinguished\r\na manner, that an express but brief notice of their merits becomes\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ANTONIO DE SOLIS--MORETO--JUAN DE HOZ--TIRSO DE MOLINA--FRANCISCO\r\n    DE ROXAS--AUGUSTIN DE SALAZAR--MIRA DE MESCUA, &c.\r\n\r\nAn honourable station, beside Calderon, belongs to Antonio de Solis,\r\none of the most eminent authors of his age. He was ten years younger\r\nthan Calderon, whom he survived a few years. His literary activity was\r\nnot limited to the study of poetry; for morals, politics, and history,\r\nalso occupied his attention, particularly in his maturer years. He\r\nwrote the preludes, (_loas_), to some of Calderon’s dramas, and appears\r\nto have been connected by the ties of friendship with that great poet.\r\nThe fame of his political and historical knowledge obtained for him a\r\nplace in the administration under Philip IV. and after the death of\r\nthat monarch he was appointed to the lucrative post of _Coronista de\r\nlas Indias_, or historiographer of the transactions of the Spaniards\r\nin both Indies. While he held this office, he wrote his celebrated\r\nHistory of the Conquest of Mexico, which will be more particularly\r\nnoticed at the close of the present book. Finally, he entered into\r\nholy orders, and devoted himself almost exclusively to exercises of\r\ndevotion; he died in 1686. His plays do not display so much boldness\r\nof imagination as Calderon’s; but they are ingeniously composed in the\r\nSpanish national style of intrigue, and exhibit an elegant vivacity of\r\ndiction. With regard to pleasantries put into the mouths of servants,\r\nhe does not exactly correspond with other Spanish dramatists. His\r\ndramatic compositions are more regular than Calderon’s, because he was\r\nless liable to be seduced by the force of his imagination. Among his\r\ncomedies attributed to the heroic class, _El Alcazar del Secreto_,\r\n(the Castle of Mystery), is justly much valued. In his dramas of\r\nintrigue he has endeavoured to vary the characters more than his great\r\ncontemporary. Thus gipseys figure in his piece, called, _La Gitanilla\r\nde Madrid_, which is partly founded on Cervantes’s novel of the same\r\ntitle.[552]\r\n\r\nAugustin Moreto possessed a higher degree of comic talent than\r\nCalderon. This able and industrious writer was also favoured by Philip\r\nIV. but he became an ecclesiastic and renounced writing for the\r\ntheatre. Some of his pieces are comic from beginning to end, and are\r\nalso comedies of character, though the form of the Spanish drama of\r\nintrigue is still preserved. In his piece, entitled, _De fuera vendra,\r\nquien de casa nos eschara_,[553] (He will come from without, Who will\r\nturn us out), he has introduced an old coquette, a military coxcomb,\r\nand a doctor of laws, who besides being cowardly and pedantic, is\r\nalso amorous. These characters are drawn with a comic force which has\r\nseldom been surpassed, though it must be confessed that they partake\r\ntoo much of the caricature style. In general Moreto approximates more\r\nthan Calderon to Terence, whose comedies became, in the sequel, models\r\nfor the Spanish dramatists when the principles of the French drama were\r\nadopted. But his _gracioso_, who is always the fool of the piece in the\r\ncharacter of a servant, repeats too often the same sort of wretched\r\njests.\r\n\r\nJuan de Hoz likewise approached to the comic style of the regular\r\ndramas representing character. Of this author nothing further is known,\r\nexcept that he wrote an excellent comedy, entitled, _El castigo de la\r\nMiseria_, (Avarice Punished,) which presents a considerable resemblance\r\nto one of Cervantes’s novels.[554]\r\n\r\nTirso de Molina, or Gabriel Sellez, (as his real name is said to\r\nhave been) was one of the most prolific dramatic writers among the\r\ncontemporaries of Calderon. He is the reputed author of upwards of\r\nseventy plays still extant. He vied with Lope de Vega and Calderon\r\nin the merit of ingenious and bold invention, which is particularly\r\nmanifested in his historical and spiritual dramas.[555]\r\n\r\nThe dramas of intrigue by Francisco de Rojas, or Roxas, a knight of the\r\norder of Santiago, were, about the middle of the sixteenth century,\r\nas much esteemed as those of Calderon; for the art of ingenious\r\ncomplexity which they exhibited, rendered them particularly pleasing\r\nto the Spanish taste. A play by this author, entitled, _Entre Bobos\r\nanda el Juego_[556], (When Fools play the Game goes well), is even at\r\nthe present day a distinguished favourite on the Spanish stage. He was\r\nnot so successful as a writer of heroic comedies. His _Casarse para\r\nVengarse_, (Marriage of Vengeance), which is a sort of tragedy, is\r\ndisgustingly surcharged with bombastic phrases.\r\n\r\nAgustin de Salazar y Torres, was educated in Mexico, and after his\r\nreturn to Spain, lived at the court of Philip IV. He was an admirer of\r\nGongora, and as many of his poems prove, also a faithful disciple; but\r\nthough an inveterate Gongorist, he was one of the cleverest writers\r\nof that school of affectation. His dramatic works are distinguished\r\nfor ingenuity of invention, and a style which shews that he knew\r\nhow to elevate himself above the common level, without running into\r\nbombast.[557] His heroic comedy, entitled, _Elegir al Enemigo_, (How to\r\nchoose an Enemy), is full of genuine poetry.\r\n\r\nAntonio Mira de Mescua, or Amescua, who lived as an ecclesiastic at\r\nthe court of Philip IV. must not be omitted in the list of the Spanish\r\ndramatic poets of the period now under consideration. He was regarded\r\nby many of his contemporaries as a second Lope de Vega;[558] and he\r\ndoubtless more nearly approached the rude brilliancy of Lope than\r\nthe elegant manner of Calderon. He remained, however, far behind his\r\nmodel; yet his historical and spiritual dramas are distinguished for\r\nconceptions, which, though extravagant, are not devoid of interest, and\r\nwhich were moreover perfectly in unison with the prevailing Spanish\r\ntaste. In _El Caballero sin Nombre_, (The Knight without a Name), he\r\nhas even ventured to introduce a wild bear on the stage.\r\n\r\nTo the historian who makes the dramatic literature of Spain his\r\nparticular object, must be consigned the task of collecting the\r\nnecessary information respecting the works of Antonio de Mendoza, Luis\r\nVelez de Guevara, Alvaro Cubillo, Luis Coello, Felipe Godinez, Juan\r\nMatos Fragoso, and other dramatists, who in the age in which they\r\nlived, were frequently placed on a level with Calderon. The writer\r\nwho devotes his attention to this department of Spanish literature,\r\nmust likewise take into consideration the older dramatic works which\r\nappeared during the latter years of Lope de Vega’s career, as, for\r\nexample, the comedies of Juan Ruiz de Alarcon, Guillen de Castro,\r\n&c.[559] Neither must he neglect to furnish bibliographic accounts\r\nof the various collections of Spanish dramas published by different\r\neditors. In the present work it is only necessary to observe,\r\nthat these collections, the greater part of which appeared in the\r\nseventeenth century, were all speculations of the booksellers. Most\r\nof them present abundant traces of haste and negligence, and but few\r\nare distinguished for critical discrimination in the selection. The\r\nhistorian of the Spanish national taste will, however, consult those\r\ncollections with the view of ascertaining what dramas were, at a\r\ncertain period, the greatest favourites in Spain; for the booksellers\r\npublished their collections in conformity with the humour of the\r\npublic. Thus every drama which was printed, was styled a _Comedia\r\nfamosa_, so that about the middle of the seventeenth century, the\r\nepithet _famosa_, had, by frequent repetition, lost all value.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION OF THE HISTORY OF SPANISH ELOQUENCE AND CRITICISM\r\n    WITHIN THE PERIOD OF THIS SECTION.\r\n\r\nThe works belonging to the department of elegant prose, which appeared\r\nduring the period of the ascendency of dramatic poetry in Spanish\r\nliterature, may be noticed in few words. The authors who still adhered\r\nto the spirit of genuine eloquence, gave no new direction to rhetorical\r\ncultivation; they merely continued, with laudable perseverance, the\r\ntask begun by their predecessors, namely, that of opposing the party\r\nwho methodically endeavoured to introduce into prose composition a new\r\ntone of ingenious absurdity.\r\n\r\nRomantic prose no longer maintained a conflict with true eloquence,\r\nbut proceeded in a separate course. The reading portion of the Spanish\r\npublic continued to be supplied with romances and novels, most of\r\nwhich, however, were the production of obscure writers. Several Spanish\r\nladies contributed their share in this kind of authorship.\r\n\r\nThe necessary distinction between historical and romantic narrative\r\nwas now made by the historiographers or chroniclers, whose numbers\r\nhad been augmented since the extension of the Spanish possessions in\r\nIndia and America. But among all these writers, Antonio de Solis,\r\nwho has already been noticed as a dramatic poet, is the only one\r\nwho produced a work deserving to be ranked among the models of\r\nhistorical composition. His history, which he wrote in the quality of\r\nhistoriographer of the Indies, is the last classic relic of the kind\r\nof which Spanish literature can boast. It contains an account of the\r\nConquest of Mexico, in a genuine historical form, notwithstanding that\r\nthe subject was calculated to seduce a poetic author into the romantic\r\nnarrative style.[560] Those who are unacquainted with the fact of\r\nAntonio de Solis being a celebrated poet, will never conjecture it from\r\nthe general tone of this work. No writer could possibly mark with more\r\nsolidity of taste the distinction between poetry and prose. Antonio de\r\nSolis had, however, attained the age of maturity when he laid down the\r\nprinciples by which he was guided in the discharge of his functions as\r\na historian. He states in his preface that in history all ornaments\r\nof eloquence are merely accessaries; and that the accuracy of the\r\nrelation is true historical elegance. He says, that truth must be of\r\nall things the most important to the historian, and that in historical\r\ncomposition what is truly stated, is well stated.[561] According to\r\nthese principles the very worst style possible would be tolerable in\r\na faithful historical narrative. But it would appear that Antonio de\r\nSolis, through a distrust of his own poetic imagination, exaggerated\r\nto himself the necessity of self-denial as an homage due to historical\r\nfidelity; and this exaggeration, which in reality was only theoretical,\r\nproved of essential service to him in the execution of his work. His\r\ntalent for description, and his cultivated taste, naturally elevated\r\nhim above the dryness and dulness of the common chronicle style. Though\r\nhe seems scarcely to have reflected on the more essential requisites\r\nof the historical art, yet his work has not suffered by their neglect;\r\nfor as a dramatic poet he had been accustomed to an arrangement of\r\nevents which concentrated them in a single point of view; and profound\r\npolitical knowledge was not required for the just exposition of\r\ntransactions occurring in the expedition of a small party of Spanish\r\nadventurers, led on by the daring Hernando Cortes, to the conquest of\r\nthe kingdom of Mexico. Nothing more was necessary than a simple and\r\nunaffected narration, to cause the interest naturally belonging to the\r\nsubject to be strongly felt.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION OF GONGORISM INTO SPANISH PROSE--BALTHASAR GRACIAN.\r\n\r\nThe elegant simplicity of the historical style adopted by Antonio\r\nde Solis, forms, with the Gongorism which about this time crept\r\ninto Spanish prose composition from the poetic school of Gongora,\r\na rhetorical contrast, which is the last remarkable phenomenon in\r\nthe history of Spanish eloquence. The pedantic commentators of the\r\nunintelligible Gongora had long been accustomed to write a strange\r\nfantastic prose style; but this prosaic Gongorism had not infected\r\nany man of distinguished talent, until Lorenzo, or Balthasar Gracian,\r\nbecame a popular author. Writers on literature mention but few\r\nparticulars respecting the life of this distinguished man, who is\r\nsupposed to have died in the year 1652. It is probable that he himself\r\nconcealed his literary existence; for it is conjectured that the works\r\nwhich on their title-pages bear the name of Lorenzo Gracian, were\r\nreally written by Balthasar Gracian, who was a Jesuit, and the brother\r\nof Lorenzo. Respecting Lorenzo nothing further is known than that he\r\nis understood to have lent his name to the productions of his brother;\r\nbut, be this as it may, the writings which have conferred celebrity on\r\nthat name, are, in some measure, sufficiently jesuitical.[562] They\r\nrelate, in general, to the morality of the great world, to theological\r\nmorality, and to poetry and rhetoric. The most voluminous of these\r\nworks bears the affected title of _El Criticon_. It is an allegorical\r\npicture of the whole course of human life divided into _Crisis_, that\r\nis to say, sections according to fixed points of view, and clothed\r\nin the formal garb of a pompous romance. It is scarcely possible to\r\nopen any page of this book without recognizing in the author a man,\r\nwho is in many respects far from common, but who from the ambition\r\nof being entirely uncommon in thinking and writing studiously and\r\ningeniously, avoids nature and good sense. A profusion of the most\r\nambiguous subtleties, expressed in ostentatious language, are scattered\r\nthroughout the work;[563] and those affected conceits are the more\r\noffensive, in consequence of their union with the really grand view\r\nof the essential relationship of man to nature and his Creator,\r\nwhich forms the subject of the treatise. Gracian would have been an\r\nexcellent writer had he not so anxiously wished to be an extraordinary\r\none. His shorter productions, in which he developes his theory of\r\nthe intellectual faculties, and the conduct of life, are still more\r\ndisfigured by affected ornament than the tedious Criticon;[564] they,\r\nhowever, occasionally contain striking observations intelligibly\r\nexpressed.[565] His _Oraculo Manual_ has been more read than any other\r\nof his works. It is intended to be a collection of maxims of general\r\nutility, but it exhibits good and bad precepts, sound judgments, and\r\nrefined sophisms, all confounded together. In this work Gracian has\r\nnot forgotten to inculcate the practical principle of jesuitism “to be\r\nall things to all men,” (_hacerse a todos_), nor to recommend his own\r\nfavourite maxim, “to be common in nothing,” (_en nada vulgar_), which\r\nin order to be valid would require a totally different interpretation\r\nfrom that which he has given it.\r\n\r\nGracian’s _uncommon_ prose was formed according to certain principles.\r\nHis book on the Art of Ingeniously Thinking and Writing,[566] is no\r\ninconsiderable contribution to criticism in Spanish literature. He\r\nrefines to an incredible degree on subtle distinctions and antitheses,\r\nwith the view of systematically bringing the style of his countrymen\r\nto the level of his own. His illustrative examples are selected from\r\nItalian and Spanish poets, particularly from Marino, Gongora and\r\nQuevedo. Throughout the whole work, ingenious thoughts (_conceptos_,)\r\nare constantly the subject of consideration. A man of genius, he says,\r\nmay receive these ideas from nature; but art enables him to create\r\nthem at pleasure. “As he who comprehends such ideas is an eagle, so\r\nhe who is capable of producing them must be ranked among angels; for\r\nit is an employment of cherubims and an elevation of man which raises\r\nhim to sublime hierarchy.”[567] He then proceeds to describe those\r\n_conceptos_, which he pronounces to be undefinable, because “they are\r\nto the understanding what beauty is to the eye, and harmony to the\r\near.”[568] Next follows an enumeration and explanation of the numerous\r\ncombinations by which the various classes of these ideas, for example,\r\nthe proverbial, the pathetic, the heroic, &c. may be produced. Poetic\r\nfigures are examined in rotation; and the style of true eloquence is\r\ndefined according to the same principles. Thus throughout the whole\r\nbook good sense and good taste are most ingeniously abused.\r\n\r\nThis art of poetry and rhetoric by Gracian was, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, the only work of the kind which produced any influence on the\r\ntaste of writers and the public.\r\n\r\nGongorism peeps forth even in the published letters of the eminent men\r\nof this period, which exhibit a strained formality and an affected\r\nelegance. The letters of Quevedo form in this respect no exception.\r\nEven in those of Antonio de Solis the facility of the true epistolatory\r\nstyle is wanting.[569]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n    HISTORY OF SPANISH LITERATURE FROM ITS DECLINE IN THE LATTER HALF\r\n    OF THE SEVENTEENTH TO THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is intended to be only a compendious supplement to the two\r\npreceding books of the History of Spanish Poetry and Eloquence. Were it\r\neven an agreeable task to describe in detail through what gradations a\r\nnation rich in intellect, which unfortunately descended from the most\r\nbrilliant height of literary independence, to the servile imitation of\r\nforeign forms, passed in this lamentable decline, until the depressed\r\nnational spirit began with patriotic feeling again to arise, and slowly\r\nto re-animate the native literature--it still would be proper to leave\r\nthat office to the writer whose object it may be to give an account of\r\nevery production which appears within the circle of polite learning.\r\nFrom him, however, who has rather chosen to take a general historical\r\nview of the developement and progress of literary genius and taste in\r\nmodern Europe, it would be unreasonable to expect specific notices of\r\ninferior works, published during the period of an expiring and slowly\r\nreviving literature. In the eighteenth century, no poet arose in Spain\r\nto form an epoch such as that finally marked in Italian literature by\r\nMetastasio; and whatever was then accomplished in Spanish prose, was a\r\nconsequence of the imitation of French models.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to observe, that according to the laws of\r\nnature and the human mind, no distinct line of separation can exist\r\nbetween this period and that which precedes it. When lights are\r\ngradually and imperceptibly extinguished, it is impossible to name\r\nthe moment when obscurity commenced. It would be no less difficult\r\nto fix precisely the epoch of the revival of Spanish literature, for\r\nit is marked by no particular phenomenon. The necessary division\r\nin the history of the progressive and retrogressive state of\r\nSpanish literature must therefore be referred, without any precise\r\ndetermination, to the reign of Charles II. from 1665 to 1700. Some\r\ndramatic authors who maintained the respectability of the Spanish\r\nnational theatre, to the beginning of the eighteenth century, will\r\nconsequently be included in this last book. Thus the account of the\r\nnew dawn of national genius, promising better times, will be given in\r\nconnexion with the immediately preceding literary transactions.\r\n\r\nThis book may be conveniently divided into three chapters. The first\r\nwill contain the history of the complete decay of the Spanish national\r\nspirit in respect to literature. In the second will be given a brief\r\naccount of whatever literary events appear to deserve consideration\r\nfrom the reign of Charles II. to the commencement of the reign of\r\nCharles III. The third chapter will be devoted to a summary notice of\r\nthe more recent occurrences, which particularly in the last ten years\r\nof the eighteenth century appear to have given a new direction to\r\nSpanish literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\n    GENERAL VIEW OF THE STATE OF POETICAL AND RHETORICAL CULTIVATION\r\n    IN SPAIN DURING THIS PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the century composed of the reigns of the three Philips, from\r\n1556 to 1665, that is to say, the golden age of Spanish literature,\r\nthe national spirit, which the vicious system of the government was\r\ncalculated to repress, became at last like the national resources,\r\ncompletely exhausted. Under Charles II. the wounds of the body politic\r\nwhich had long profusely bled, began to exhibit frightful gangrenes.\r\nIn every quarter of the world Spanish valour had done its uttermost\r\nfor the support of the perverse measures of a despotic government, and\r\nthe state at length seemed on the verge of dissolution. The enormous\r\ntreasures which poured into Spain from the mines of America, were\r\nimmediately consigned to foreign nations. Thus the richest country\r\nin the world was overwhelmed with debt. Agriculture and industry\r\nlanguished particularly in the interior of the monarchy, where a near\r\nview of the splendour of an ostentatious court still served to gratify\r\nCastilian vanity, but where every blow levelled against the whole\r\nstate was most directly felt. The occupation of one half of America\r\ncarried off men from the mother country by thousands at a time; and in\r\naddition to this drain, the population had been suddenly diminished to\r\nthe extent of nearly half a million, by the tyrannical expulsion of the\r\nMoriscos, or baptized Arabs. Spain was also engaged in uninterrupted\r\nwarfare during the whole of the century in which the three Philips\r\nreigned. Continual levies of troops, combined with oppressive\r\ntaxation, at length so reduced the nation, that the government lost\r\nthe instrument it had abused; and every sacrifice made to meet cases\r\nof imperious urgency, served only to produce a new humiliation. The\r\nlittle kingdom of Portugal, by a fortunate effort threw off the Spanish\r\nyoke, and became once more an independent state. Torrents of Spanish\r\nblood were shed in the Netherlands, with the view of suppressing, at\r\nany price, the freedom of the United Provinces; yet those provinces\r\nflourished in full vigour, while Spain was reduced to the last stage\r\nof political inanition. Still, however, Spanish genius appeared to\r\nsoar superior to all the evils that assailed the state, as long, at\r\nleast, as the semblance of the ancient national greatness remained. But\r\nwith the death of Philip IV. even that semblance vanished. The widowed\r\nqueen, who was appointed guardian of the young king, then only five\r\nyears of age, acting under the influence of father Neidhart, a German\r\nJesuit, offered the last insult to the feelings of the nobility and the\r\npeople. No sooner was father Neidhart driven away by the party of Don\r\nJohn of Austria, the natural son of Philip IV. than France obtained\r\npossession of a considerable portion of the provinces which Spain still\r\nheld in the Netherlands. In the West Indies a republic of pirates was\r\nestablished. This new enemy grew out of the remarkable association of\r\nthe Flibustiers, or Buccaneers, men who regarded Spanish America as a\r\nbooty on which they were entitled to prey. This state of things was\r\nnot improved when the full powers of government were placed in the\r\nhands of the weak Charles II. the period of whose reign is the most\r\nmelancholy in Spanish history.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance of a French prince being called to the Spanish\r\nthrone, in obedience to that will of Charles II. which has been so\r\nmuch censured, was by no means unfortunate for Spain, either in a\r\nliterary or political point of view. The war, which was partly a civil\r\ncontest, and which was maintained for twelve years before the new\r\nPhilip, the fifth of that name, was tranquilly seated on his throne,\r\nseemed, however, to threaten the annihilation of the last remnant of\r\nSpanish national vigour. The mild and rigidly pious Philip V. was,\r\nby his personal character and mode of thinking, previously related\r\nto the nation to which he now belonged. He manifested no desire\r\nto transplant into Spain the literature of France, which at that\r\ntime began to exercise an influence over the whole of Europe. The\r\nforeigners whose promotion to important posts during the reign of the\r\nfirst Bourbon in Spain, rendered them the objects of much patriotic\r\njealousy, were Italians and Irishmen, but in no instance Frenchmen.\r\nThe French influence operated in Spain, only on the wavering politics\r\nof the cabinet of Madrid; the change of the reigning dynasty produced\r\ntherefore little or no influence on Spanish literature. All that Philip\r\nV. did to promote the advancement of learning on the French model,\r\nwas wholly confined to the celebrated institution of royal academies,\r\namong which the academy of history, and still more, the academy of\r\nthe Spanish language and polite literature,[570] may be regarded as\r\nhaving operated influentially on the literature of Spain. But this\r\nlast-mentioned academy, which was established in the year 1714, was\r\nnever intended for the annihilation of the spirit and peculiar forms of\r\nSpanish poetry and eloquence. The cultivation of the Spanish language\r\nwas its especial care, and its labours for the accomplishment of that\r\nobject were crowned by the production of its excellent dictionary.\r\nThe efforts made by some members of this academy to form the taste of\r\ntheir countrymen on the model of that of France, must be attributed\r\nto themselves individually. They merely followed the new current of\r\nFrench taste, in common with almost every person in Europe, who had\r\nthen any pretensions to polite education. If these innovators must be\r\ncalled a literary court party, the term can only be employed in the\r\nsense in which it would, with equal propriety, apply to the same sort\r\nof party existing in other countries, where the French style became the\r\nfashionable style of courts, and was, with courtier-like complaisance,\r\ngenerally adopted by authors both in verse and in prose.\r\n\r\nThe French taste spontaneously penetrated into Spanish literature\r\nwhen the age of Louis XIV. began to exercise an imposing influence\r\nover the whole world. But the French taste would have operated on\r\nthe literature of Spain, which had already been carried so far\r\nbeyond that of France, in a very different manner, had not the old\r\nnational energy been crippled in every direction. Had it not been\r\nfor this unfortunate circumstance crowds of servile imitators and\r\npseudo critics would never have obtained a footing in Spain. Men of\r\nrightly cultivated understanding would have reconciled their purer\r\ntaste to the yet unexhausted national genius, in order to enhance\r\nthe advantages of Spanish literature in its competition with the\r\nliterature of France, and to learn true elegance from the French,\r\nwithout, like them, sacrificing to mere elegance beauties of a higher\r\norder. But the age of vigour was past; and yet feeble pride would in\r\nno respect renounce its pretensions. Two parties now arose in the\r\npolite literature of Spain. The leading and would-be elegant party,\r\nincluded persons of rank and fashion, who had begun to be ashamed of\r\nthe ancient national literature, and who yet wished to prove that that\r\nnational literature, even when estimated according to the rules of\r\nFrench criticism, possessed many beauties. That the French might no\r\nlonger boast of superior taste, this party sought to improve Spanish\r\npoetry, and particularly the Spanish drama, by translations of French\r\nworks and imitations of the French style. To this party of fashionable\r\ninnovators was opposed the old national party, composed of persons\r\ndistinguished for their obstinate attachment to the ancient taste, and\r\neven to the ancient rudeness. This party continued, as heretofore, to\r\nbe that of the Spanish public; but it remained for a time without any\r\nliterary representative. Thus was it reduced to the necessity of seeing\r\nwriters, who laid claim to the title of Spanish patriots, publicly\r\nattack its old favourites, particularly Lope de Vega and Calderon,\r\nwhile no zealous pen took up their public defence. Nevertheless this\r\nparty continued unshaken in its opinions. Even during the extreme\r\ncrisis of the conflict between the French and the national taste, about\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century, the Spanish theatre preserved its\r\nown peculiar forms. It assumed, however, a character no less varied\r\nthan the German theatre at present exhibits. Plays in the national\r\nstyle were performed on the Spanish stage alternately with translations\r\nand imitations of French and even of English dramas; and if this\r\nheterogeneous variety did not degenerate into the monstrous, as it now\r\ndoes on the German stage, where a national style never prevailed, yet\r\nnothing could be more inconsistent than the contrast formed by plays\r\nin the French and English taste with the old Spanish comedies. But\r\nthese comedies, and in general all the old national poetry, once more\r\nobtained spirited defenders among Spanish critics and authors, after\r\nthe shock of the last crisis had been withstood by the ancient taste in\r\nits conflict with the modern. Thus another literary triumph was gained\r\nby the tenacity of the Spanish public, to which, in matters of taste,\r\nmonarchs otherwise despotic, readily granted perfect freedom.\r\n\r\nThe mixture of national and foreign taste in the modern literature of\r\nSpain, was promoted in no slight degree by the introduction of French\r\nmanners, which had at this period spread over Europe, but which were\r\nin Spain less encouraged by court example than in other countries. At\r\nthe court of Madrid, old Spanish formality was still preserved; and\r\namong the nobility, as well as the people, the national costume was\r\nonly gradually superseded by the French style of dress. Bull fights\r\ncontinued to be the favourite amusements of the Spaniards from the\r\nhighest to the lowest ranks. But the solemn _Autos de Fe_,[571] in\r\nwhich the inquisition appeared in all the splendour of its power,\r\nand in which heretics were burnt amidst the approving shouts of the\r\nspectators, no longer insulted humanity. The last of these horrible\r\nfestivals of fanaticism was performed with extraordinary pomp at Madrid\r\nin the year 1680, in compliance with the pious wish of King Charles II.\r\nThe Bourbons who succeeded to the Spanish throne, whatever might be\r\nthe ardour of their catholic zeal, appeared to regard such barbarous\r\nspectacles with disgust, and thus set an example of refinement which\r\nhonourably marked their relationship to the French royal family. At\r\nthis period, too, when the storm of the reformation had subsided,\r\nreligion as well as manners assumed a milder character throughout all\r\nEurope. The Spaniards, however, could not be induced to renounce their\r\nsacred comedies, until in the year 1765 they were formally prohibited\r\nby a royal decree, because they excited the derision of foreigners.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the second half of the eighteenth century, scientific\r\nlearning gained an ascendancy over polite literature in Spain, as\r\nin every other part of Europe. A philosophy in the sense of the\r\nFrench encyclopædists inflicted wounds equally mortal on fanaticism\r\nand poetic enthusiasm. The spirit of experiment which sought by an\r\naccumulation of facts to scan the furthest depths of human knowledge\r\nand the principles of all science, and styled that accumulation sound\r\nphilosophy, had, since the time of the French encyclopædists, found\r\nfavour in Spain, as in every part of Europe, Germany excepted. True\r\npoetry, to which this spirit of experiment is the most dangerous of\r\nall enemies, could not easily revive in its former magnificence. But\r\na wider field of general utility was, under certain restrictions,\r\nopened to elegant prose; and criticism at least obtained the negative\r\nadvantage of being able to impede any new encroachments of ingenious\r\nextravagance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n    DECAY OF THE OLD SPANISH POETRY AND ELOQUENCE, AND INTRODUCTION\r\n    OF THE FRENCH STYLE INTO SPANISH LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last branch of Spanish national poetry still flourished in the\r\nreign of Charles II. The French drama, which then appeared in the first\r\ndawn of its celebrity, had as yet no influence on the drama of Spain.\r\nSeveral assiduous writers continued to enrich Spanish literature with\r\nnew pieces in the manner of Calderon; and these writers have here the\r\nfirst claim to consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANDAMO, ZAMORA, AND CAÑIZARES, DRAMATISTS IN THE OLD NATIONAL STYLE.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the seventeenth century, the dramas of Francisco\r\nBancas Cándamo, were particularly esteemed. Cándamo, who was an\r\nAsturian of noble extraction, received, during a certain period, a\r\npension from Charles II. for writing for the court theatre at Madrid.\r\nHe, however, died in indigence in the year 1709. His historical\r\nplay, entitled, _El Esclavo en Grillos de Oro_, (the Slave in Golden\r\nFetters), is still spoken of in terms of approbation in Spain.[572] It\r\nis a romantic anecdote taken from the history of the Emperor Trajan.\r\nThe singular combination of the ancient and the romantic costume which\r\nthis play presents, is a fault with which the author must not be\r\nreproached; for since Lope de Vega’s time the spirit of the Spanish\r\ndrama required that the events of ancient history should be arrayed\r\nonly in the garb of romance. But Cándamo has put into the mouth of the\r\nEmperor Trajan, a superabundance of phrases which are exceedingly dull,\r\nthough conveyed in light and harmonious verse. The purely romantic\r\nscenes in which ladies and young knights appear, are the best in this\r\ndrama, which, according to the Spanish classification is a heroic\r\ncomedy.\r\n\r\nAntonio de Zamora, a gentleman belonging to the court of Madrid, was\r\nparticularly distinguished as a writer of comic dramas. The comedy,\r\nentitled, _El Hechizado por Fuerza_, (the Bewitched by Force),[573]\r\nis one of the most humorous and regular in the Spanish language. It\r\nmay also be numbered among the dramas of character; at least the two\r\nprincipal parts, though a little overcharged, are nevertheless boldly\r\nconceived and consistently maintained. One is a fantastic old man, who\r\ncontinually expresses himself in a tone of sarcastic comic humour:--he\r\nmakes a parade of his odd fancies, as if they were so many proofs of\r\nreal wisdom; and he is induced to consent to a marriage under the\r\nidea that he is bewitched. The other comic character is an enamoured\r\nphysician, who is prevailed on to take a part in the pretended\r\nbewitching, and who on his part is also outwitted by the sprightly\r\ngirls whom he has assisted in playing off their trick on the old man.\r\n\r\nJoseph de Cañizares, who likewise lived at the court of Madrid,\r\nproduced a considerable number of Spanish comedies. He particularly\r\ndevoted his attention to that class of dramas of intrigue, called\r\n_comedias de figuròn_, in which the principal character is a pretender\r\nor braggadocio, either male or female, who by dint of impudence and\r\nartifice, obtains a certain degree of credit. Among the dramas of\r\nCañizares, the Spaniards particularly esteem his comedy, entitled, _El\r\nDomine Lucas_;[574] it is a drama of character, comic throughout, and\r\nof the most regular description, though it by no means departs from\r\nthe Spanish national style. The title may be translated “The Pedant\r\nSquire;” for Domine Lucas, the hero of the piece, is a young country\r\ngentleman, a student of Salamanca, extremely dull and affected, and\r\nwithal proud of his noble birth. With this character is very happily\r\ncombined the uncle of Lucas, a brave, amiable, and sensible old\r\ngentleman; though, like his nephew, he interlards his discourse with\r\nscraps of latin from the _Corpus Juris_. An old domestic, who likewise\r\nhas resource to latin whenever his wit fails him, is well grouped\r\nwith his master’s. An excellent female pendant to the doltish hero is\r\nexhibited in the character of one of the daughters of the old uncle,\r\nwho in the end is united to Lucas, while her sprightly sister, to whom\r\nthe Domine was betrothed, elopes with a more agreeable lover. The\r\ntraits of character in the whole of this comic picture, though by no\r\nmeans delicately sketched, are, nevertheless, full of dramatic spirit.\r\n\r\nThese, and other plays, by writers whose names are not in any other\r\nrespect distinguished, complete the national treasure of the Spanish\r\ndrama. The striking regularity which distinguishes some pieces, must\r\nby no means be attributed to the influence of French taste. It is\r\npossible that a vague idea of the regularity of the French comedy may\r\nat this time have penetrated into Spain; but among the older Spanish\r\ndramas, particularly those of Solis and Moreto, some are no less\r\nregular than the comedies of character written by Zamora and Cañizares;\r\nwho, besides, did not always, any more than their predecessors,\r\nconfine themselves rigidly within the bounds of regularity. In the\r\nworks of these latter poets, the theatrical personages are precisely\r\nof the same cast as in the writings of the older dramatists. Young\r\nofficers, who are usually represented as giddy lovers, boast of their\r\nadventures in Flanders, and sing romances to the accompaniment of the\r\nguitar. This part is the prototype of that which on the French stage\r\nwas subsequently called the _Chevalier_. No trace of the imitation of\r\nFrench manners is perceptible; and, if here and there a French word is\r\nintroduced, it is always with a comic signification.[575]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOÑA JUANA INEZ DE LA CRUZ.\r\n\r\nNothing poetical produced at this period, or at least nothing sung\r\nand written in the lyric or other styles of poetry in Spain, obtained\r\nliterary celebrity. It would, however, be unjust to pass over in\r\nsilence some works which made their appearance about this time, and\r\nwhich are interesting, inasmuch as they afford instances of the\r\ncontinuation of the taste for old Spanish poetry. Among these, the\r\nmost remarkable are the numerous productions of a Spanish American\r\npoetess, named Doña Juana Inez de la Cruz, who was much celebrated\r\nin Mexico about the latter end of the seventeenth century. On the\r\ntitle-page of her works, which, however, she did not publish herself,\r\nthis distinguished woman is styled the tenth muse.[576] Respecting\r\nthe history of her life, nothing is known, save what is mentioned\r\nin her poems. She was a nun in a Mexican convent; and she complains\r\nof her weak state of health in the verses which form the preface to\r\nher poems. Her writings sufficiently prove that she lived on terms of\r\nintimacy with the viceroy and the other Spanish grandees in Mexico, and\r\nthat frequent demands were made upon her talent for the celebration\r\nof festivals, both spiritual and temporal. Much as Inez de la Cruz\r\nwas deficient in real cultivation, her productions are eminently\r\nsuperior to the ordinary standard of female poetry. Of all the Spanish\r\nladies who have turned their attention to poetry, she deserves to rank\r\nthe highest; though, perhaps, this station may not be deemed very\r\nhonourable, as Spanish women have so little distinguished themselves\r\nin poetry. But for this very reason it seems the more worthy of\r\nrecollection, that under the sky of America, flowers of genius were\r\npermitted to bloom, which in Spain would in all probability have been\r\nblighted in the bud. The poems of Inez de la Cruz, moreover, breathe\r\na sort of masculine spirit. This ingenious nun possessed more fancy\r\nand wit than sentimental enthusiasm; and whenever she began to invent,\r\nher creations were on a bold and great scale. Her poems are of very\r\nunequal merit; and are all deficient in critical cultivation. But\r\nin facility of invention and versification, Inez de la Cruz was not\r\ninferior to Lope de Vega; and yet she by no means courted literary\r\nfame. The complete collection of her poems, which seems to have been\r\nfirst printed by order of the Vice-Queen of Mexico, occupies a volume,\r\nconsisting of twenty-five sheets in octavo. Of some of her sonnets\r\nthe subjects are ingenious plays of romantic wit;[577] of others,\r\nserious poetic reflections.[578] She also wrote burlesque sonnets on\r\nrhymed endings, which, though sometimes deficient in delicacy, have\r\nall the freedom and sprightliness that can be required in that species\r\nof composition. A kind of poetic self-deception, which assumes the\r\ntone of philosophic reasoning, is disclosed in several of the lyric\r\nromances of Inez de la Cruz. She evidently took considerable pains to\r\npersuade herself that she was happy.[579] A great portion of her poems\r\nin the romance style, relate to circumstances of temporary interest.\r\nIn her dramatic works, the vigour of her imagination is particularly\r\nconspicuous. The collection of her poems contains no comedies, properly\r\nso called, but it comprises a series of boldly conceived preludes,\r\n(_loas_), full of allegorical invention; and it concludes with a long\r\nallegorical auto, which is superior to any of the similar productions\r\nof Lope de Vega. It is entitled, _El Divino Narciso_, a name by\r\nwhich the authoress designates the heavenly Bridegroom. The Spanish\r\npublic had never before witnessed so bold a travesty of the ideas\r\nof catholic christianity, under the garb of the Greek mythology. It\r\nwould be impossible to give a brief, and at the same time intelligible\r\nsketch of this extraordinary drama. With regard to composition it is\r\nquite monstrous; in some respects offending by its bad taste, and in\r\nothers charming by its boldness. Many of the scenes are so beautifully\r\nand romantically constructed, that the reader is compelled to render\r\nhomage to the genius of the poetess; while at the same time he cannot\r\nbut regret the pitch of extravagance to which ideas really poetic are\r\ncarried. There is one peculiarly fine scene in which human nature, in\r\nthe shape of a nymph, seeks her beloved, the real Narcissus, or the\r\nchristian Saviour. The imagination of the authoress had, doubtless,\r\nbeen influenced by impressions received from the Song of Solomon.[580]\r\nNext to this grand Auto, the spiritual canciones in the old Spanish\r\nstyle, and some cantatas deserve to be distinguished among the works\r\nof Inez de la Cruz. They abound in sentimental fancies, which, though\r\ngenerally extravagant, often possess beauties which render them highly\r\ninteresting; and according to the notices in the collection, they\r\nwere all sung in the churches of Mexico. Some latin compositions of\r\nthe same class are inserted, which seem also to have been written by\r\nInez herself. The writer who may undertake a history of the poetic\r\ndevelopement of the catholic faith, will find his advantage in\r\nrendering himself intimately acquainted with these poems.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERARDO LOBO.\r\n\r\nIn order to be satisfied that Spanish poetry inclined very little\r\nto the French, in the early part of the eighteenth century, it is\r\nonly necessary to advert to the continued influence of Gongorism\r\nat that period, as exemplified in poetic productions, which are in\r\nother respects too unimportant to claim any notice. Men of rank in\r\nparticular, who, following the honourable example of their forefathers,\r\ncontinued to cultivate the arts and sciences, seem to have regarded\r\nGongorism as the only style that was truly gentlemanly and worthy of\r\ntheir adoption. Accordingly Eugenio Gerardo Lobo, who was a captain\r\nin the Spanish guards, and commandant of the town and fortress of\r\nBarcelona, composed in his leisure hours, many spiritual and temporal\r\npoems in the manner of the Gongorists, which, since the author’s\r\ndecease, have been reprinted.[581] A new edition of these poems, which\r\nappeared in 1758, is inscribed by the publisher to a miraculous image\r\nof the virgin, with all the usual formality of a dedicatory epistle.\r\nIn this dedication the holy virgin, in quality of queen of heaven, is\r\naddressed by the title of “Your Majesty.” Thus in the middle of the\r\neighteenth century, when an elegant and learned party had long rendered\r\nhomage to French literature, the taste of the Spanish public could\r\nstill endure absurdities of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFUSION OF THE FRENCH TASTE--LUZAN, HIS ART OF POETRY, &c.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, in the commencement of the eighteenth century that\r\nthe French taste found its way into the Spanish academy; and this\r\ncircumstance, which was not the effect of accident, serves to mark a\r\nkind of epoch in the history of Spanish poetry.\r\n\r\nIgnacio de Luzan, who has become the authority to whom most Spanish\r\ncritics refer, must be regarded as the founder of the French school in\r\nSpanish literature. He was a member of the royal Spanish academy, a\r\nmember of the academy of history, an honorary member of the academy of\r\npainting, sculpture, and architecture; and at the same time counsellor\r\nof state and minister of commerce. In addition to these dignities,\r\nhe was distinguished for extraordinary learning; and he was in\r\nparticular very deeply versed in ancient literature. He studied with\r\ngreat assiduity Aristotle’s Art of Poetry and Rhetoric, and also the\r\nrhetorical works of Cicero. He was a lover of poetry, and composed\r\nvery elegant verses in his native tongue. Being, as his writings\r\nsufficiently prove, a man of candid and enlightened mind, national\r\npride did not deter him from making himself intimately acquainted\r\nwith French literature; and comparing it without prejudice, under its\r\nbest point of view, with the literature of his own country. This was\r\ncertainly a course altogether new for a Spanish author.\r\n\r\nIn order to form a just estimate of the spirit of Luzan’s labours, it\r\nis necessary to bear in mind that the theoretical literature of Spain\r\nfurnished him with scarcely a single trace of sound criticism; that\r\neven those Spanish poets who possessed the justest feeling for poetic\r\nbeauty, propounded, in their theoretic explanations, the most erroneous\r\nnotions on the value and the essence of poetry; that only a critical\r\ntact, and an instinctive imitation of good models, had preserved the\r\nmost correct among the Spanish poets from wanderings of the imagination\r\nand perversions of judgment; and that in the age of Luzan, the only\r\nart of criticism which was theoretically taught in Spain, had issued\r\nfrom the school of Gongora, and was consequently only calculated\r\nto assist the systematic propagation of absurdity and affectation.\r\nMoreover, the elegant correctness of the French poets was, in that age,\r\ncalculated to dazzle by the charm of novelty. Finally, the delicate\r\nsubtleties whereby the principles of French criticism and of French\r\npoetry, since the age of Moliere and Corneille, were derived from\r\nthe classic school of antiquity, and the moral syllogisms with which\r\nthose principles were entrenched behind Aristotle’s Art of Poetry, as\r\ntheir last bulwark, were well calculated to seduce a man of Luzan’s\r\nerudition. His partiality for the French school, and his efforts to\r\nreform the Spanish taste according to the principles of that school,\r\nare therefore no proofs of narrowness of mind, though genuine poetic\r\nfeeling certainly was not within the sphere of his talent. He possessed\r\na delicate sense for elegance and the dress of poetry, but not for the\r\nenergy and loftiness of poetic genius. It is thus easy to account for\r\nhis having, with the best intentions, theoretically misunderstood the\r\nessence and design of poetry; and for his also having, in conformity\r\nwith the spirit of French criticism, confounded the objects of the poet\r\nwith the duties of the orator and the moralist.\r\n\r\nIt was then with the view of fundamentally reforming the literary taste\r\nof his countrymen, that Luzan wrote his celebrated Art of Poetry. It\r\nwas first published at Saragossa in the year 1737, in a folio volume\r\ncontaining five hundred and three pages;[582] and it has ever since\r\nbeen the code to which Spanish critics and authors have referred\r\nfor the decision of all cases of doubt. Sound judgment and classic\r\nerudition are the chief characteristics of the work. The diction too is\r\nsimple and elegant, and prolixity is avoided, though in order to attain\r\nthat degree of perspicuity which was necessary for subduing Spanish\r\nprejudice, much detail was indispensable. Newly discovered truths must\r\nnot be looked for in Luzan’s Art of Poetry. He even claims credit for\r\nthe doctrines he developes on account of their venerable antiquity. His\r\ntheory is declared by himself to be in the main no other than that of\r\nAristotle, the greatest of philosophers. To the neglect of that theory\r\nhe attributes the multitude of monstrous excrescences by which Spanish\r\nliterature is disfigured. He therefore conceived he was rendering,\r\nthough at the risk of being reproached with pedantary,[583] an\r\nimportant service to the literature of his country, by the restoration\r\nand just application of those ancient and only true principles which\r\nhad long been acknowledged and valued by the critics of foreign\r\nnations. In support of his doctrines, Luzan regards the critical\r\nobservations of various French writers, particularly Rapin, Corneille,\r\nCrousaz, Lamy, and Madame Dacier, as next in authority to the works of\r\nAristotle. He also availed himself of the Italian works of Gravina and\r\nMuratori. These, and other foreign authors, are quoted by name. Spanish\r\nreaders must, doubtless, have been not a little surprised to find\r\namong the quotations passages from French authors, given in the French\r\nlanguage, under the Spanish text. This was an unexampled phænomenon in\r\nSpanish literature; and though a trifling circumstance it serves to\r\nprove the increasing influence of the French language in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe want of novelty in the principles of Luzan’s Art of Poetry, is\r\ncompensated by the new application of those principles to Spanish\r\nliterature. The arrangement of the theory, which was introduced,\r\nalso belongs, at least in part, to himself; and in the developement\r\nof that theory it is easy to recognize the man of judgment, and the\r\nperfect master of his subject, though he only improved what had been\r\npreviously produced. The work is divided into four parts or books.\r\nThe first developes, according to the notions of the author, the\r\norigin, progress, and essence of poetry, (_el origen, progressos y\r\nessencia de la poesia_.) The second book explains the usefulness and\r\npleasure of poetry, (_utilidad y deleyte de la poesia_.) The third\r\nbook treats, at ample length, of tragedy, comedy, and other kinds\r\nof dramatic composition; and the fourth of epic poetry. These chief\r\ndivisions present, indeed, only the outline of Aristotle’s Art of\r\nPoetry; and Luzan’s work, can no more than its prototype, be regarded\r\nas a complete theory of the poetic art. In this respect Luzan went\r\nno further than his predecessor, Lopez Pinciano, who had long before\r\nequally clearly perceived that the work, called Aristotle’s Art of\r\nPoetry, was, in fact, merely a fragment.[584] It is singular enough\r\nthat Luzan takes no notice of Pinciano’s remarkable work; but whether\r\nhe was unacquainted with it, or whether he was intentionally silent,\r\ncannot now be known. Within the boundaries of his four unsystematic\r\ndivisions, Luzan pursues his own course; but the present is not the\r\nproper occasion for accompanying him step by step. As, however,\r\nthe publication of Luzan’s book has been attended by important\r\nconsequences, it will be proper to explain the manner in which this\r\ncritic understood the principles of Aristotle, and how he applied them\r\nto Spanish literature.\r\n\r\nLuzan in his exposition and application of Aristotle’s theory, takes\r\nhis departure from the same false principle which misled all the\r\nFrench critics in the age of Louis XIV. He views poetry closely and\r\ndirectly on its moral side; but not in that comprehensive manner in\r\nwhich every thing, when contemplated on its moral side, ought to be\r\nexamined; he regards it merely as an art destined to aid morality,\r\nproperly so called; and that aid appears to him the more easily given,\r\nbecause he adopts the maxim that the object of poetry is to be at once\r\nuseful and agreeable.[585] Deceived by this gothic idea, which seems\r\nto have been founded on the misunderstanding of a verse of Horace, and\r\nwhich is certainly as old as modern literature, it became impossible\r\nfor him either to attain a just notion of the poetic workings of the\r\nimagination, in relation to the beautiful, or to discover the truth\r\nof the proposition that such employment of the imagination possesses\r\nin itself, under the proper restrictions, a moral value, and ennobles\r\nhuman existence. Having fallen into the common error, Luzan, like the\r\nFrench poets and critics, was capable of taking only a very contracted\r\nview of poetic beauty. Genuine simplicity and elegance, and in both a\r\ndelicate infusion of wit, formed with Luzan, as with the French poets\r\nand critics, the summary of all poetic excellence. According to these\r\nprinciples, the imagination was regarded as merely the handmaid of the\r\nrecreative wit and the moralizing judgment. Genius was to be tied down\r\nby rules in conformity with these narrow ideas of the spirit and object\r\nof poetry. To satisfy the taste, in the exercise of wit and judgment,\r\nwas regarded as the highest object of the poet’s efforts. The bold\r\nflight to a freer and fairer world, whence the true poet derives the\r\nspirit of his imaginings, in the imitation of nature, was deemed merely\r\nan agreeable accessary. In a word, the genuine essence of poetry was\r\nheld to be an adventitious ornament, while its station was usurped by\r\nmere natural sentiment, and elegant or ingenious simplicity.\r\n\r\nThe useful and the agreeable, in the trivial signification of the\r\nterms, are therefore the verbal pivots around which Luzan’s whole\r\npoetic theory turns. It is easy to conceive what degree of excellence\r\nand truth was to be derived from such principles in their application\r\nto Spanish literature. Luzan zealously supported the cause of good\r\ntaste against the absurdities of the Gongorists.[586] He exposed,\r\nwithout reserve, the weak side of Lope de Vega’s poetry; and the\r\nexamples he selects from the works of that poet, in order to shew how\r\nfar they are at variance with nature and reason, prove precisely what\r\nthey are intended to prove. But to admire genius in its wanderings,\r\nand even in many cases to prize those wanderings more than a frigid\r\nelegance, required a view of the subject which Luzan’s mind did not\r\nembrace. He was precisely the man to detect and enumerate the errors\r\nof the favourite poetry of his country; but he wanted the critical\r\neye which would have enabled him to do justice to its beauties.\r\nAfter defining poetry to be an “imitation of nature, either general\r\nor particular, made in verse, for utility or amusement, or for both\r\ntogether,”[587] he goes on to say, that little plays of wit, such as\r\nsonnets, madrigals, and songs, may sometimes have no other object\r\nthan agreeable amusement; but that in poetry of a more important kind,\r\nsuch as comedies, tragedies, and epopee, the useful and the agreeable\r\nmust necessarily be combined together, that is to say, the work must\r\nat once instruct and entertain. Accordingly, when he comes to treat\r\nmore particularly of dramatic poetry, he says, “tragedy is such an\r\nimitation of an action as is calculated to correct fear, pity, or\r\nother passions; but a comedy must be an action so represented as to\r\ninspire love of some virtue, or hatred and abhorrence of some vice\r\nor fault.”[588] It is not necessary to particularize the judgments\r\nwhich a critic, armed with these opinions, must have pronounced on\r\nthe Spanish drama. Luzan not only blamed the Spanish dramatists for\r\nthe violation of the Aristotelian unities, on the ground that such\r\nviolation was contrary to nature; but he even condemned as not moral,\r\nor at least not sufficiently moral, the genuine nature which he could\r\nnot avoid recognizing in their works. He, however says, that what\r\nis first to be esteemed in the Spanish dramatists, “is in general\r\ntheir ingenious invention, their extraordinary wit and judgment,\r\nadmirable and essential qualities in great poets. Lope de Vega merits\r\nparticular praise for the natural facility of his style, and the adroit\r\nway in which he has in many of his comedies painted the customs and\r\nthe character of certain persons. I admire in Calderon the dignity\r\nof his language, which without ever being obscure or affected is\r\nalways elegant.”[589] He proceeds to eulogize the art of ingenious\r\ndevelopement displayed in Calderon’s dramas of intrigue; and attributes\r\na similar merit to some of the comedies of Antonio de Solis and\r\nMoretto. Under the same point of view he judges the writings of the\r\nlater Spanish dramatists, on which he confers particular commendation\r\non account of their superior regularity.[590] Next follows a list of\r\nthe faults, which, according to the above principles, he imputes to\r\nthe Spanish drama in general, and to the favourite dramatic poets of\r\nthe Spanish public in particular; and on this subject he makes many\r\njust observations. He had good reasons for not venturing to attack the\r\nSpanish Autos. He accordingly dismisses them very briefly, pronouncing\r\nno literary judgment on them, and merely observes that they are\r\nallegorical representations in honour of “the most holy sacrament of\r\nthe altar.”\r\n\r\nThus did a critic, whose voice a century earlier would scarcely have\r\nbeen heard, systematically undertake to reform Spanish taste. It\r\nappears from Luzan’s introductory observations that he was either not\r\nsufficiently acquainted with the history of the poetry of his nation,\r\nor had forgotten most essential facts, otherwise he never could have\r\nadopted the notion that Spanish taste had degenerated for want of\r\nlearned critics to open the eyes of the public. The Spaniards of\r\nLuzan’s age paid no more attention to his Art of Poetry, than their\r\nancestors had bestowed on Lopez Pinciano’s, which inculcated the same\r\nprinciples two hundred years earlier, when the Spanish drama was in\r\nits infancy. But the members of the Spanish academy regarded Luzan’s\r\nbook with as much veneration, as if through it the light of pure taste\r\nhad first been disclosed to Spain; and thus was the academy at length\r\nplaced in conflict with the public it sought to improve. Whether all\r\nthe members of that literary institution concurred in Luzan’s plans of\r\ncritical reformation cannot now be known. This, however, is certain,\r\nthat nothing was written in defence of the national style, either by\r\nan academician or by any other critic or amateur; and all the writers,\r\nwho, since that period, have by means of critical treatises and new\r\ndramas, zealously laboured to improve the dramatic literature of Spain,\r\naccording to French principles, have been members of the Spanish\r\nacademy.\r\n\r\nLuzan himself did his utmost to support his theory by some original\r\npoetic productions and translations from the French. He translated\r\none of Lachausée’s comedies; but with what success it was represented\r\non the Spanish stage is not mentioned. It was, however, followed by\r\nvarious translations of French dramas by other writers.\r\n\r\nLuzan’s poetic compositions are certainly honourably distinguished\r\nby correctness, facility and elegance, and by what may be termed the\r\npoetry of language, from the works of the Gongorists which at that time\r\nwere not entirely exploded in Spain. They consist of occasional poems\r\nand poetic trifles, such as might have been written without the aid of\r\ngenius by any man of cultivated mind, possessing a certain degree of\r\ndescriptive talent. Zealous Gallicist as Luzan was, he had too much\r\nsolidity of taste to attempt an imitation of the structure of French\r\nverse in the Spanish language; and accordingly his contributions to\r\nthe poetic literature of his country are in the usual national metres.\r\nA poem in octaves, which he read on the opening of the academy of\r\npainting, sculpture and architecture, in 1752, fifteen years before the\r\npublication of his Art of Poetry, received particular approbation. He\r\nread poetic compositions of the same kind on several occasions. Some of\r\nhis odes and canciones were not published till after his decease; among\r\nthe number are two on the re-taking of the Fortress of Oran;[591] an\r\noccasional poem, entitled, the Judgment of Paris, which is prettily\r\nconceived, and elegantly executed;[592] and some poems imitated from\r\nthe Greek of Anacreon and Sappho.[593] Luzan died in the year 1754.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYANS Y SISCAR--BLAS NASSARE.\r\n\r\nAmong the contemporaries of Luzan, the royal librarian, Gregorio Mayans\r\ny Siscar, is entitled to praise, for having, in biographical, literary\r\nand rhetorical works, furnished many hints and notices which throw\r\nlight on the history of Spanish poetry and eloquence. His collection of\r\ndetached writings on the History of the Spanish Language, (_Origenes de\r\nla Lengua Española_), embraces more than the title promises; and among\r\nother things contains a well written discourse exhorting authors to\r\npursue the true idea of Spanish eloquence.[594] But his diffuse Art of\r\nRhetoric,[595] which he published twenty years later than the work last\r\nmentioned, is merely a formal compilation of the ideas and criticisms\r\nof Aristotle and modern writers. It might with equal propriety be\r\nentitled an art of poetry. The examples given from the poets are long\r\nand numerous.\r\n\r\nBlas Antonio Nassare, prelate and academician, laboured to attain the\r\nsame kind of merit. He was, however, so blinded by his predilection for\r\nFrench literature, that he considered the eight comedies of Cervantes,\r\nwhich he first restored to light, as parodies on the style of Lope de\r\nVega.[596]\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTIANO’S TRAGEDIES IN THE FRENCH STYLE.\r\n\r\nAgustin de Montiano y Luyando, who was counsellor of state, director\r\nof the academy of history, and a member of the Spanish academy,\r\nundertook to introduce regular tragedy on the Spanish stage according\r\nto Luzan’s principles. With this view he wrote two tragedies, the one\r\nentitled _Virginia_, and the other _Ataulpho_, in which, with the\r\nexception of the rhymeless iambics, which he substituted for the French\r\nAlexandrines, he has most anxiously endeavoured to fulfil all the\r\nconditions required by French criticism.[597] Both these tragedies are\r\nremarkable for pure and correct language; for the cautious avoidance of\r\nfalse metaphor; and for a certain natural style of expression, which\r\nis sometimes wanting even in the dramas of Corneille and Racine. They\r\nare, however, formed on the French model with such scrupulous nicety\r\nthat they might be mistaken for translations.[598] It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to mention, that in these tragedies the Aristotelian unities\r\nare rigidly observed, and that in the Virginia the father does not stab\r\nhis daughter on the stage.\r\n\r\nTo the play of Virginia which was published in 1750, some years before\r\nAtaulpho, Montiano annexed a historical critical treatise on Spanish\r\ntragedy.[599] Patriotism had certainly some share in this treatise;\r\nfor in the first place, Montiano wished historically to defend his\r\ncountrymen against the reproach that no Spanish tragedy had ever been\r\nwritten; and secondly, he wished in his Virginia to furnish the first\r\nexperiment of a Spanish tragedy, without violation of dramatic rules,\r\nthough he did not pretend to set up that specimen as a model. He\r\nstates, with all due modesty, that his work cost him much labour, and\r\nexpresses a hope that his countrymen will be induced to imitate his\r\nexample, to disregard the approbation of the ignorant multitude, and to\r\nstrive to do better than he had done.[600] In a preface to his tragedy\r\nof Ataulpho he enlarges on the same theme.\r\n\r\n\r\nVELASQUEZ.\r\n\r\nAmong the number of the Spanish Gallicists must likewise be included\r\nthat intelligent writer Luis Joseph de Velasquez. His History of\r\nSpanish Poetry, (_Origenes de la Poesia Española_), which was published\r\nin 1754, proves that the Spaniards had then, in a great measure,\r\nforgotten their national literature. Velasquez unquestionably took\r\nconsiderable pains to collect, with critical spirit, those facts which\r\nwere probably better known to him than to any of his contemporaries;\r\nand yet he has, upon the whole, obscured rather than elucidated the\r\nhistory of Spanish poetry. His criticism is quite in the French style,\r\nwith a slight tincture of Spanish patriotism. Velasquez was a member of\r\nthe French academy of inscriptions and belles lettres.\r\n\r\nNot a single Spanish poet of distinguished merit flourished during the\r\nfirst half of the eighteenth century. That such a barrenness should\r\nhave succeeded so great a fertility of talent, is a circumstance which\r\nthe exhaustion of the national spirit does not sufficiently explain.\r\nIt is also necessary to take into the account the conflict maintained\r\nbetween favour shewn to the French style and the demands of the\r\nSpanish public. Supported by national approbation, the Spanish poetry\r\nhad gloriously flourished; but it perished when new arbiters of taste,\r\nwho judged according to foreign principles, could with impunity treat\r\nthe Spanish public as an ignorant multitude.[601] In this collision\r\nSpanish eloquence sustained no immediate injury. The influence of\r\nthe French style, could indeed at that time do it no injury, for at\r\nthe commencement of the eighteenth century, French prose was fitted\r\nto serve as a model for clearness, precision, facility and elegance.\r\nBut no aspiring spirit now animated Spanish authors. Books written in\r\ncorrect prose were produced in sufficient numbers; and yet no work\r\nappeared which deserved particular distinction for rhetorical merit, or\r\nwhich contributed in any degree to invigorate the literature of Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING PERIOD OF THE HISTORY OF SPANISH POETRY AND ELOQUENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spanish writers who lived about the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, began to be ashamed of the unworthy bondage which had severed\r\nthem from all common feeling with the public taste. It is doubtful\r\nwhether at this particular period, the nation in general began\r\nonce more to be roused to a sense of its own importance; but this\r\nis certain, that a literary patriotism imperceptibly revived within\r\nthe narrow circle of Spanish authorship. Even several members of the\r\nSpanish academy proved that they were no longer to be satisfied with\r\nmere French elegance. The works of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies were again received into favour. Men of superior talents\r\narose, who endeavoured to combine Spanish genius with French elegance;\r\nand the literature of Spain began to acquire a new life.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA HUERTA.\r\n\r\nOne of the first who openly attacked the party of the Gallicists, was\r\nthe patriotic Vicente Garcia de la Huerta, a member of the Spanish\r\nacademy, and librarian to the king. None but a man whose literary\r\njudgments were accredited by the same honourable posts which gave\r\npeculiar weight to those of the Gallicists, could at that time hope\r\nto oppose with success the fashionable opinion concerning Spanish\r\nliterature. La Huerta, however, undertook a dangerous task, for with\r\nevery talent and right feeling for genuine poetry, he was by no means a\r\nskilful critic. In systematic coolness of judgment he was incompetent\r\nto enter the lists with men of Luzan’s critical ability. The true\r\nprinciples on which Spanish poetry was to be defended against French\r\ncriticism, were at that period not at all understood; and La Huerta\r\nwas not the man to discover them. But his feeling acted in the place\r\nof his judgment. It groped on when abandoned by theory, and rejected\r\nevery theory to which it could not be reconciled. Conscious of his\r\ndeficiency, La Huerta was extremely diffident whenever his opinions\r\ncame into collision with those of Luzan and other academicians. But\r\nwhen his task was to reply to the observations of French critics,\r\nhis patriotic enthusiasm knew no bounds. In exercising the law of\r\nretaliation, he attacked the admired Coryphæi of the French Parnassus\r\nwith a grossness which would cast a stigma on his reputation for taste,\r\ndid not his other works sufficiently prove him to have been unjust,\r\nonly through the excess of a just indignation. Fortunately for La\r\nHuerta, it was not until his works had obtained decided credit that he\r\nopenly avowed his hostility to the Gallicists. Among the poems which\r\nfirst conferred celebrity on his name, is a piscatory eclogue, which\r\nhe read at a distribution of academic prizes in the year 1760. This\r\npurely occasional effusion is written in the national lyric style of\r\nthe eclogues of the best period of Spanish poetry, and is free from\r\norientalisms.[602] Three years afterwards, on a similar occasion, he\r\nread a mythological poem in stanzas. These were succeeded by other\r\npoems, also of occasional origin, by which La Huerta disarmed the\r\ncritics, who might have been disposed to assert that he was destitute\r\nof the necessary feeling for French elegance. The romances by which\r\nhe sought to give to that style of national poetry a new existence in\r\nthe elegant world, seem to have been written at various periods of his\r\nlife. Besides lyric romances, which had not entirely lost their ancient\r\nconsideration, he composed narrative romances in the old style. In one\r\nof the latter compositions his success is remarkable.[603] He likewise\r\nrevived the Spanish custom of composing poetic glosses; and some of his\r\nsonnets deserve the highest praise. That he was well acquainted with\r\nlatin and French poetry is evident from his metrical translations of\r\nsome of Horace’s odes, and of several fragments from the works of the\r\nFrench poets.[604]\r\n\r\nBut he had greater difficulties to overcome in his endeavours to\r\nrestore the Spanish drama to its former lustre. He was not so great a\r\npoet as to be able to advance, accompanied by French elegance, in the\r\nsame course in which Calderon had stopped. Calderon’s dramas were,\r\nhowever, still performed with approbation, in spite of all that was\r\nsaid by the critics, and La Huerta wrote for one of these pieces a\r\nprologue (_loa_) in the old style. At length when he thought he could\r\nrely on the favour of a certain portion of the public, he came forward\r\nwith his first essay in tragic art. His _Raquel_, (Rachel), a tragedy,\r\nwhich was intended to combine the old Spanish forms with the dignity\r\nof the French tragic style, without being subject to the French rules\r\nof dramatic art, was first performed at the court theatre of Madrid\r\nin 1778. For upwards of half a century no new drama had been received\r\nwith such enthusiasm by the Spanish public. It was represented at\r\nevery theatre in Spain; and even before it was printed upwards of two\r\nthousand copies were taken, and many sent as far as America.[605] The\r\nGallicists in Spain now rose in opposition to La Huerta; but he replied\r\nto them in a tone of contemptuous haughtiness, while he always observed\r\nthe strictest modesty in addressing the public.\r\n\r\nLa Huerta’s Rachel is not a master-piece; but it is a noble testimony\r\nof the poetic national feeling of an ingenious writer, who exerted\r\nhis utmost endeavours to restore the credit of the Spanish drama. The\r\nsubject is taken from the old history of Castile. King Alphonso VIII.\r\nwho has resigned his heart and his royal dignity to the fair Jewess\r\nRachel, is implored by the people and the nobility to shake off the\r\ndishonourable yoke. He hesitates between love and duty, until the\r\nspirit of discontent, which has been with difficulty repressed, breaks\r\nforth in rebellion. While the king is out hunting, Rachel is surprised\r\nin the palace, and her base counsellor, Ruben, murders her to save\r\nhis own life; which he only preserves until the arrival of the king,\r\nby whom he is killed in return. The tragedy is divided, according to\r\nthe old practice, into three _jornadas_; but, in other respects, it\r\nis obvious that the author took considerable pains to conform, under\r\ncertain limitations, to the French rules of dramatic art. The dialogue\r\nproceeds uniformly in iambic blank verse, without the introduction of\r\nsonnets, or any other kind of metre. All irregular theatrical pageantry\r\nis avoided. The language, upon the whole, preserves a dignified\r\ncharacter; and in several scenes the tragic pathos is complete.[606]\r\nBut the composition fails in the distribution of the characters. Only\r\na feeble light is thrown on Rachel, the heroine of the tragedy. Her\r\ncounsellor, Ruben, is a stupid contemptible Jew, whose lamentations\r\nin the moment of danger border closely on the ludicrous;[607] and the\r\nweak character of the king, who changes his resolutions on every new\r\nimpression, frequently approaches caricature. The author has, however,\r\nsucceeded admirably in exhibiting a striking contrast in the characters\r\nof two Spanish grandees:--the one is a base courtier, named Manrique;\r\nwhile the other, Garcia de Castro, in all his sentiments and actions is\r\na correct representative of the spirit of ancient Spanish chivalry in\r\nits purest dignity. In the patriotic portraiture of this character, La\r\nHuerta’s whole soul is developed;[608] and the national spirit which\r\npervades the tragedy, doubtless contributed in no small degree to\r\nensure its celebrity.\r\n\r\nLa Huerta’s tragedy of _Agamemnon Vengado_, is a work of trivial\r\nimportance compared with Rachel. It is founded on the prose translation\r\nof the Electra of Sophocles, which Perez de Oliva produced two\r\nhundred years earlier;[609] but it is a remarkable, and by no means\r\nunsuccessful attempt to unite the romantic and the classic forms,\r\naccording to the conditions required by a modern audience. La Huerta\r\nwrote his Agamemnon in compliance with the wishes of some ladies of\r\nMadrid, who were desirous of seeing a tragedy in the Grecian costume.\r\nThe place of the chorus is, after the French manner, supplied by\r\na female confidante. Part of the scenes are entirely taken from\r\nSophocles, others are those of the original remoulded, and some are\r\nnew. From the beginning to the end of the tragedy, the poetic language\r\nis admirably preserved; and the alternation of the rhymeless iambics\r\nwith octaves and lyric metres, completes the beauty of the whole.[610]\r\n\r\nFinally, La Huerta adapted Voltaire’s _Zaire_ to the Spanish stage.\r\nAfter he had unquestionably acquired the right of pronouncing a\r\ndecided opinion on the literature of his country, he published his\r\n_Theatro Hespañol_; and in his prefaces to some of the volumes of\r\nthat collection, he launched forth his invectives against the French\r\ndrama.[611] La Huerta’s _Theatro Hespañol_ is a classic selection\r\nfrom the incalculable store of Spanish dramas; and the selection is\r\ncertainly well made consistently with the plan which he had adopted.\r\nWith the view of marking his hostility towards the Gallicists,\r\nhe selected only those Spanish comedies which are particularly\r\ndistinguished for elegant ingenuity in point of invention and\r\nexecution. Thus upwards of three-fourths of the whole collection\r\nconsists of _comedias de capa y espada_, chiefly from the pen of\r\nCalderon. But for this very reason the work does not properly fulfil\r\nits title, as it exhibits the Spanish theatre only under one point of\r\nview. La Huerta has not even selected a single piece from Lope de Vega,\r\nbecause the plays of that great dramatist were not sufficiently elegant\r\nfor his purpose: neither has he granted a place to the most beautiful\r\nof Calderon’s heroic comedies, being deterred from inserting them by\r\ntheir irregularity; and in conformity with the plan he had laid down,\r\nhe could with still less propriety admit an _Auto_ into his collection.\r\nBy this work he, however, attained the objects he had in view, which\r\nwere to restore the Spanish national comedy to its honourable place\r\nin literature, and to vent his feelings of indignation against the\r\nGallicists. He treats the Italian authors, who had openly avowed their\r\ndisapproval of the Spanish drama, with no less severity than he had\r\nevinced towards the French critics. Quadrio, Tiraboschi, Bettinelli,\r\nand other writers “of the same breed,” (_de la misma raza_), are\r\ndenounced by La Huerta as malignant and envious critics. He accuses\r\nSignorelli, of “notorious falsehood.” “Childish egotism,” he says, is\r\nthe soul of French criticism. The icy coldness of French tragedy was\r\nwith him more offensive than the neglect of rules in the Spanish drama.\r\nRacine, the favourite tragic writer of the French school, owed his fame\r\nsolely to the “tedious scrupulosity,” which he observed in composing\r\nhis tragedies, but not to the “masculine vigour of genius, or the fire\r\nand spirit of fancy.” The “natural sublimity” of Spanish genius could\r\nnot be restrained by the fetters of the French school. Luzan, though\r\nin many respects a very estimable author, was imbued with prejudices.\r\nVelasquez, with all his delicacy and erudition had fallen into the\r\nerrors and misconceptions of Luzan. In general, Spanish poetry had,\r\nlike the Spanish nation, a certain _oriental_ character, which it was\r\nfit it should preserve. French imitations of Spanish dramas of intrigue\r\nare declared perfectly insupportable; and, in particular, the Marriage\r\nof Figaro, “a comedy altogether contemptible,” (_despreciada en todas\r\nsus partes_.[612])\r\n\r\nLa Huerta remained a debtor to the public for the critical grounds of\r\nthese denunciations, which called forth the bitterest answers from the\r\nadverse party, and also for a reply to his opponents. He asserted\r\nbriefly and bluntly that those opponents were merely “a ludicrous pack\r\nof cynical and drivelling critics, the vehicles of envy, ignorance, and\r\nimbecility.” What might not this patriotic author have effected had he\r\nbeen as energetic in his reasoning as in his abuse! He nevertheless\r\nappears to have contributed more than any of his contemporaries to\r\nproduce a re-action in Spanish literature, which was indispensable to\r\ngive to that literature the opportunity of again acquiring a poetic\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEDANO.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the choice Spanish poems, collected by Don Juan\r\nJoseph Lopez de Sedano, was a circumstance very favourable to the\r\nrestoration of the poetry of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to\r\nits proper place in Spanish literature. This work appeared in the year\r\n1768, under the title of the _Parnaso Español_; but there certainly\r\nwould have been little difficulty in producing a better collection. The\r\nnotions which Sedano entertained respecting religion and morality have\r\ninduced him to mingle not a few bad and indifferent productions with\r\npoems of superior merit; and it was by no means a happy idea to reprint\r\nlong translations, such, for example, as the whole of Tasso’s Amynta,\r\nwhen so much of the rich fruit of the original Spanish stock remained\r\nungathered. But the undertaking was praiseworthy; and the biographical\r\nand literary notices annexed to the work rendered the Spanish public\r\nonce more acquainted with estimable authors whom it ought never to have\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\nYRIARTE.\r\n\r\nTomas de Yriarte, general archivist to the high council of war, and\r\ntranslator to one of the ministerial departments of state in Madrid,\r\ncombined French elegance with the ancient forms of Spanish poetry in a\r\nmanner very different from that of La Huerta. After he had acquired a\r\ncertain degree of reputation by several translations of French dramas,\r\nby original poems in the latin language, and various other literary\r\nlabours, he obtained more decidedly the favour of the elegant portion\r\nof the Spanish public by his _Fabulas Literarias_, (Literary Fables),\r\nwhich were first printed in the year 1782.[613] Yriarte conceived the\r\nnovel idea of rendering literary truths, many of which may at the same\r\ntime be regarded as moral truths, themes for fables in the style of\r\nÆsop; and of composing these fables in every variety of verse which\r\nwas in any way applicable to them. No classical fabulist had hitherto\r\nappeared in Spanish literature. Yriarte’s fables are, however, not only\r\nremarkable for their classic language and excellent versification,\r\nbut they possess a peculiar charm of style which may be mistaken for\r\na happy imitation of the manner of Lafontaine, though it is to be\r\ntraced to a different source. Like Lafontaine, Yriarte had a true\r\nfeeling for that delicate harmony which is so indispensable to the\r\nfabulist, and for that spirited infantine style, which, in a graceful\r\nprattling, playfully unfolds the truth as it were intuitively, and, as\r\nit ought always to be disclosed, in apologue, without the slightest\r\ntrace of didactic design. He had no need to turn to the writings of\r\nforeigners in quest of the literary elements of such a style. It\r\nwas only necessary to combine the exquisite simplicity of many old\r\nSpanish romances and songs, with the true spirit of Æsopian fable,\r\nand his narrative style could not fail to assume the tone in which it\r\nso successfully rivalled the manner of Lafontaine. Accordingly among\r\nYriarte’s sixty-seven literary fables, those which are composed in\r\nredondillas and other kinds of Spanish national measures, possess the\r\nsuperiority in point of graceful execution. Some are not remarkable for\r\ntheir didactic merits. But even when the idea, or what is styled the\r\nmoral, presents no particular interest, Yriarte’s fables please by the\r\ngraceful handling of the subject: an example of this may be seen in\r\nthe fable of the Ass, which finding a flute in a meadow, accidentally\r\nbreathes into the lip-hole with his nose, and on hearing the tone of\r\nthe instrument, persuades himself that nature has qualified him for\r\na musician.[614] Whether Yriarte wholly invented these fables, is a\r\nquestion which can only be decided by laborious investigation. One\r\nof the number, in so far as regards the lesson or moral, precisely\r\nresembles Gellert’s fable of the Painter in Athens.[615] Yet this\r\ncircumstance by no means warrants the inference that it is borrowed.\r\n\r\nConsiderable praise has been bestowed on a didactic poem by Yriarte,\r\nentitled Music;[616] but with all the merits which this production\r\nmay in other respects possess, it is no less deficient in the true\r\ncharacteristics of a didactic poem, than are the earlier essays of the\r\nSpaniards in the same class. It is judiciously conceived, executed with\r\nthe requisite elegance of language, and contains many passages which\r\nare by no means destitute of poetic beauty.[617] But the systematic\r\nform is not disguised by poetic composition. Instead of diffusing\r\na poetic interest over the truths which were to be inculcated, and\r\npresenting even the instruction as a picture of the imagination,\r\naccording to the proper though seldom realized idea of a didactic\r\npoem, Yriarte, like most didactic poets, regarded instruction as the\r\nmain object, and the creations of poetic fancy merely as accessory\r\nembellishments: thus three-fourths of his work consist only of\r\nelegantly versified prose.[618]\r\n\r\n\r\nLEON DE ARROYAL.\r\n\r\nTo give an account of all the other poets, who at the latter end of the\r\neighteenth century contributed to restore the credit of Spanish poetry,\r\nis a task which must be consigned to other historians of literature,\r\nwho may possess favourable opportunities for rendering themselves\r\nintimately acquainted with the more recent productions of Spanish\r\ngenius. A considerable number of bibliographic notices which would\r\ncontribute to the accomplishment of this object are extant.[619]\r\n\r\nIn taking a survey, however, of the latest period of the history\r\nof Spanish poetry, the odes of Leon de Arroyal must not be\r\noverlooked.[620] Though these odes are inferior to the older Spanish\r\nproductions of the same sort, yet some of them are distinguished,\r\nnot indeed for bold, but for airy flights of fancy;[621] and for\r\nharmonious versification.[622] At the time of their appearance there\r\nwere likewise published anonymously some anacreontic songs by a lady,\r\nwho imitated Villegas with grace as well as with decorum.[623]\r\n\r\n\r\nJUAN MELENDEZ VALDES.\r\n\r\nBut a poet of the graces, who has had but few equals even in the golden\r\nages of Spanish poetry, and who excels in his particular sphere,\r\nremains to be noticed. This ornament of modern Spanish literature, is\r\nJuan Melendez Valdes, a doctor of law, and, perhaps, still professor\r\nof polite literature in Salamanca. A delicate fancy, ever lively,\r\nyet ever true to nature; an uncommon intensity of feeling; graceful\r\nturns of thought; a classic precision and elegance of language, and\r\nthe most pleasing flow of versification, exist in so eminent a degree,\r\nand are so happily combined in this author’s works, that the critic\r\nis compelled to become a panegyrist, if he be not totally insensible\r\nto the charm which such a phenomenon presents in modern poetry.[624]\r\nAt an early period of life, Melendez began to retrace the footsteps\r\nof Horace, Tibullus, Anacreon, and Villegas; but, as he must have\r\nfelt that the luxuriant graces of his Spanish model were not to be\r\nexcelled, his imagination appears to have spontaneously applied itself\r\nto a more exquisite painting of amatory ideas and images, and to the\r\ndignifying of that kind of poetry by a certain moral delicacy to the\r\nobservance of which Villegas attached too little importance. The joys,\r\nsorrows, and sports of rustic love, rural festivals and amusements,\r\nare the materials which confer a peculiar character on the anacreontic\r\neffusions of Melendez. Were it not that the picturesque descriptions\r\nsufficiently indicate the Spaniard,[625] his verses might sometimes\r\nbe mistaken for translations from an English or German poet. Nothing\r\ncan surpass some of his descriptions in the graceful colouring of\r\ntender sentiment.[626] It is only necessary to bestow a slight glance\r\non the compositions of Melendez to feel the injustice of the reproach\r\ncast on Spanish poetry, by a French traveller, who observes “that the\r\nSpaniard is so completely a citizen, that not even in his poetry does\r\nhe manifest a taste for rural life.” This reproach, which is probably\r\nonly directed against the poetic writers of the present day, would\r\nbe unworthy of notice were it intended to apply to the Spanish poets\r\nof the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, whose numerous pastoral\r\ncompositions abound in descriptions of rural scenery, which evince an\r\nintuitive perception of the poetic beauties of unsophisticated nature.\r\nBe this as it may, the Spanish academy thought proper, in the year\r\n1780, to award a prize for the best poem in praise of rural life; and\r\non this occasion Melendez gloriously competed with Yriarte.\r\n\r\nBesides the anacreontic poems of Melendez, his lyric romances, his\r\npopular songs, in which the old national style is combined with\r\nmodern elegance, his romantic odes, his elegies and his sonnets, must\r\nbe numbered among the best productions in Spanish literature.[627]\r\nHow admirably he succeeded in the composition of poetic epistles\r\nis proved by the classical dedication of his poems to his friend\r\nJovellanos.[628] He has rendered service to the Spanish theatre by\r\ndramatizing the novel of the rich Camacho from Don Quixote. He is also\r\nthe author of several treatises on moral and philosophical subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIEF NOTICE OF SOME OF THE MORE RECENT LITERARY PRODUCTIONS OF SPAIN.\r\n\r\nIf the above information respecting some of the latest Spanish poets\r\nbe connected with the general observations and bibliographic notices\r\nin the preceding part of this history, it will plainly appear that\r\nthe revival of polite literature in Spain must have been on the one\r\nhand accelerated, and on the other retarded, by the progress which was\r\nmade in the cultivation of modern science and philosophy, during the\r\nlatter years of the eighteenth century. The period of the triumph of\r\nthe Gallicists is doubtless past, however numerous the adherents of\r\nthat party still may be. But in general the Spaniards of the educated\r\nand refined classes still blush for their ancient prejudices, and\r\nobserve, with regret, that the Spanish literature is now only labouring\r\nto acquire what it long ago neglected. In order to raise the elegant\r\nliterature of Spain to a level with that of other cultivated nations\r\nof modern Europe, it is deemed necessary to continue with persevering\r\nspirit to translate, adapt and imitate every foreign work which attains\r\nany degree of celebrity. In this concurrence of the spirit of foreign\r\nliterature with the ancient national spirit, which is by no means\r\nsuffered to perish, more than one decennial period of the present\r\ncentury will probably elapse ere Spanish poetry resume its original\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nAmong their modern dramas, the Spaniards particularly esteem the\r\nregular tragedies of Nicolas Fernandez de Moratin, and the comedies of\r\nRamon de la Cruz, who, previous to the year 1784, was computed to have\r\nwritten upwards of two hundred interludes in the old style. Spanish\r\ntranslations of the tragedies of Corneille and Voltaire, of the plays\r\nof Moliere, and other French comic writers, and of the sentimental\r\ndramas of Mercier, have also been received with approbation. Don\r\nLeandro Fernandez de Moratin, who must not be confounded with his\r\nnamesake, travelled at the expense of the Spanish government to study\r\nthe dramatic literature of the different nations of Europe; and since\r\nhis return to Spain, a considerable pension has been granted to him\r\nas a reward for one of his dramatic productions. He has rendered\r\nthe tragedy of Hamlet into Spanish, and is expected to give to his\r\ncountrymen a complete translation of Shakespeare. Don Luciano Francisco\r\nComella, who is mentioned in literary journals as one of the rivals\r\nof Leandro de Moratin in comic poetry, appears to be a very prolific\r\nwriter, and inclined to the old national style. Don Theodoro de la\r\nCalla has attempted to give Shakespeare’s Othello in Spanish, from\r\na French translation. Comella has also dramatized several recent\r\nhistorical events, among which are some points in the history of Peter\r\nthe Great, and Catharine II. of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Noroña has particularly distinguished himself as a writer\r\nof lyric poetry, and he has also translated Dryden’s Alexander’s Feast\r\ninto Spanish verse.\r\n\r\nJoseph Vasquez Cadalso, and the younger Moratin, may be ranked among\r\nthe most successful writers of satirical poetry which Spain has\r\nrecently produced.\r\n\r\n_Diana_, or the _Hunt_, by the elder Moratin; the _Happy Man_, by\r\nAlmeida; and the _Happy Woman_, by Morino, are the latest productions\r\nin didactic poetry. A Spanish translation of _How to be always Merry_,\r\nfrom the German of Uz, also occurs in the notices of new Spanish poems.\r\n\r\nThe old ambition of the Spaniards to distinguish themselves by some\r\nproduction in epic art has again revived. A work of this class,\r\nentitled, _Mexico Conquistada_, by Don Juan de Escoiquiz, has excited\r\nsome attention.\r\n\r\nSpanish pastorals in the old national style are associated with\r\ntranslations from the German of Gessner.\r\n\r\nThe collision of the natural and foreign styles is strikingly\r\nexemplified in the Spanish romance literature of the present period.\r\nThe old romance of _Cassandra_ has lately been re-printed; and a\r\nnew one in the old style, entitled, _Leandra_, has also made its\r\nappearance. All the English and French novels which obtain any\r\ncelebrity, are now translated into Spanish.\r\n\r\nElegant prose, which was earlier cultivated in Spain than in any\r\nother country in Europe, seems at length to have emancipated itself\r\nfrom the Gongorism which threatened its destruction. The prevailing\r\nstudy of French prose in Spain, has no doubt proved favourable to the\r\nrevival of the pure eloquence of the writers of the sixteenth century.\r\nNone, indeed, of the more recent works in Spanish prose is eminently\r\ndistinguished for rhetorical composition. But on the other hand, among\r\nthese publications it would be difficult to mention a single book of\r\nscience, whether original or translated, which is not written with\r\na certain degree of purity and elegance. An historical work in the\r\nSpanish language has been for some time announced, and is probably now\r\nbefore the public. It is a History of America, by D. Juan Bautista\r\nMuñoz, professor of philosophy at Valencia. The intention of the author\r\nis to exhibit the conduct of the Spaniards in America in a point of\r\nview different from that taken by Robertson; and the work is said to\r\nbe remarkable for beauty of style.\r\n\r\nThe Art of Rhetoric,[629] by Don Antonio de Capmany, a member of the\r\nSpanish Academy of History, affords a new proof of the importance which\r\nthe Spaniards attach to the cultivation of elegant prose. The preface\r\nto this work is particularly instructive. The book itself contains no\r\nnew truths, but it presents the old ones well arranged and judiciously\r\nselected. Capmany’s work, and particularly the preface, clearly shews\r\nthat Spanish eloquence is still, in some measure, in a divided state.\r\nThe classic prose of the sixteenth century is again esteemed. But in\r\nany endeavour to restore this prose unchanged, it must be difficult\r\nto avoid the appearance of affectation; for since the prevalence of\r\nthe French taste, many Spanish words and phrases, which were formerly\r\nclassical, have now become antiquated, while on the other hand, old\r\nwords and phrases have been introduced from the French. The party of\r\nthe _purists_, as the adherents of the old style are denominated,\r\nhave the prevailing language of the polite world against them; while\r\nthe polite world and the partizans of the French style, can adduce no\r\ngood reasons for rejecting the old style, which is acknowledged to be\r\npure Castilian. Capmany is decidedly favourable to the new style.[630]\r\nHowever, this conflict will not prove injurious to Spanish eloquence,\r\nif each party be willing to make concessions, in order that the old\r\nstyle may be fundamentally preserved, and yet be so modified as to\r\nconform, without affectation, to the new ideas and forms of language\r\nwhich modern science has introduced.\r\n\r\nAll these facts considered in their connexion as a whole, leave no room\r\nto doubt that the polite literature of the Spaniards may again rise to\r\nits former glory, if favoured by the ancient national spirit, to the\r\ngenial influence of which it owes its existence. The two academies of\r\npolite literature, (_de buenas letras_), at Barcelona and Seville, may\r\nlikewise contribute to the fulfilment of this object, if they seriously\r\ndevote their attention to it. The talent of the Spanish improvisatori,\r\nwho are said to be in no way inferior to those of Italy, may also be\r\ndirected to the revival of the ancient popular poetry. Since the works\r\nof the poets and elegant prose writers of the golden age of Spanish\r\nliterature have lately been republished in elegant editions, and\r\nuniversally circulated, and since the new demands of reason and science\r\nhave promoted the developement of the mental faculty in Spain, the\r\nbest results may be expected from the union of elegant and scientific\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nIt is only after having duly studied the polite literature of Spain in\r\nall its parts, with the interest attached to literary investigation,\r\nthat it is possible to characterize it as a whole, and to obtain\r\npossession of the results which such a characteristic judgment ought to\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nI. Spanish poetry is more decidedly national than any other branch\r\nof modern poetry in Europe. Even the Italians have only transferred\r\ntheir spirit and character into forms; which, though ennobled by a\r\ngenial classic refinement of style, were originally derived from the\r\nProvençals. But the Spanish, or to speak with more precision, the\r\nCastilian poetry, which arose in the neighbourhood of the Provençal,\r\nis a peculiar stream from the romantic Parnassus. When the Spaniards\r\nadmitted the Italian forms into their poetry, they did not transfer the\r\nold Spanish character to these nationalized forms, in the same manner\r\nas the Italians, by classic improvement of style, and enlargement\r\nof the boundaries of romantic composition, converted the Provençal\r\npoetry into pure Italian poetry. The Spanish poets made the classic\r\npurity, and polish of the Italian forms, subservient in a new manner\r\nto the orientalism of their ancient national literature. A tendency to\r\nthe old orientalism is indeed plainly perceptible even in the works\r\nof the few Spanish poets, who were the most disposed, like Luis de\r\nLeon, Cervantes, and the two Argensolas, to adopt the opinions of the\r\nancients and the Italians with regard to the correctness of ideas and\r\nimages. This orientalism of the Spanish character and poetry which has\r\nlong been disapproved, is now decidedly pronounced bad taste, because\r\nthe general idea of poetry, which is the same for all ages and all\r\nnations, is superseded by Greek, Italian, or French national ideas;\r\nand thus that beauty which is general is made subject to particular and\r\nsubordinate laws. But as long as the ideal creations of the imagination\r\nare not entirely at variance with reason and nature, they may far\r\noverstep the boundaries of the Greek and other national forms, without\r\nviolating the supreme laws of the beautiful. A true theory of taste\r\nshould therefore induce us to look beyond all factitious limits of the\r\ncreative and plastic powers of imagination for a critical point of\r\nview, which has only nature and reason for its basis. Considered from\r\nsuch a point of view, that orientalism, which is ridiculous and absurd,\r\nbecomes at once distinguishable from that which belongs to the truly\r\nsublime and beautiful. Spanish poets, it is true, have often failed to\r\nobserve this distinction. But owing to the usual mode of estimating\r\nSpanish literature in the mass, justice has not been done to that\r\ngenuine beauty which it so conspicuously discloses even in the midst of\r\nabsurdity.\r\n\r\nII. This unjust system of criticism appears to account for the very\r\nslight attention which has been paid to the high elegance and classic\r\npurity of a considerable portion of the polite literature of Spain.\r\nIn this respect Cervantes alone outweighs a whole host of the correct\r\nGallicists, whose highest merit is to have written interesting prose in\r\nwell constructed verse. Metrical elegance is indeed a distinguishing\r\nproperty in many of the most irregular productions of the Spanish\r\npoets; this is evident in their comedies, and more particularly\r\nin the comedies of Calderon, which present the highest charm of\r\nrhythmical harmony. On this occasion the classic prose of the golden\r\nage of Spanish literature ought also to be brought to recollection.\r\nIn the number of prose works distinguished for elegance of style\r\nand intellectual energy of composition, the literature of Spain far\r\nsurpasses that of Italy.\r\n\r\nIII. The deficiency of one kind of riches in Spanish literature, is\r\namply compensated by the abundance of another kind, which is in a\r\ngreat measure peculiar to that literature, and which has manifested\r\nitself in an inconceivable number of works. The portion of lyric poetry\r\nin which the Spaniards have imitated the Italian forms, tolerably\r\ncounterbalances the amount of Italian poetry in the same style. But if\r\nto that portion be added the whole store of lyric romances and songs\r\nin the old popular style, a multitude appears which sets calculation\r\nat defiance. Nothing, however, could be more absurd, than to estimate\r\nthe poetic fertility of a nation according to the number of works\r\ncalled poems, which it may possess. It is from the sum of genuine\r\npoetry actually existing in any considerable number of such works,\r\nthough it should be visible only in the seed or in the bud which\r\nhas withered in the opening, that the balance must be struck when\r\nthe poetic riches of nations is the subject of comparison. If the\r\nmere number of productions were to decide, Italy would be as rich in\r\ndramatic literature as Spain. But in Italy, it unfortunately happened\r\nthat scarcely any writers except those of middling and even inferior\r\ntalent laboured to increase the stock of Italian dramas to infinity. In\r\nSpanish dramatic literature, on the contrary, the most fertile writers\r\nshew themselves to be great poets even amidst their faults. According\r\nto the same principle the multitude of nominal epic poems, which have\r\nappeared in Spain, and in which scarcely a feeble spark of true epopee\r\nis discernible, must not be taken into account in estimating the poetic\r\ntreasures of Spanish literature. A single canto of Ariosto or Tasso, is\r\nworth all the Spanish epic poetry that ever was written.\r\n\r\nIV. Of all the poets of modern times, the Spanish can alone be regarded\r\nas the inventors of the poetry of catholic mysticism, which they have\r\nemployed in a very ingenious, though, it must be confessed, not in an\r\nexemplary manner. He must indeed be completely dazzled by the brilliant\r\nside of Spanish poetry, who refuses to acknowledge that the character\r\nof the sacred comedy is monstrous, even as it appears in the Autos of\r\nthe estimable Calderon. But, on the other hand, the affectation of\r\nphilosophic criticism must have deadened all susceptibility for that\r\nbold style of spiritual poetry in him who denies to the Spanish Autos\r\nthe possession of beauties, which deserve to be admired. What might not\r\nthis poetry have become, had reason extended her influence over it in a\r\nmore powerful degree, not, indeed, to reduce it to the level of prose,\r\nbut to divest it of the mask of caricature, while soaring in the lofty\r\nregions of mystic invention!\r\n\r\n\r\n    END OF VOL.

The\r\nPortuguese volume, which is in some respects the more valuable of the\r\ntwo, is not touched by the French translator.\r\n\r\n[3] _Letters from an English Traveller in Spain, in 1778, on the Origin\r\nand Progress of Poetry in that kingdom, London 1781._--This book was\r\nwritten by _Mr. Dillon_, author of “Travels through Spain,” “History of\r\nPeter the Cruel,” &c.\r\n\r\n[4] Fought in the year 712.\r\n\r\n[5] This remark, from the _Indiculo luminoso_ of Bishop Alvaro of\r\nCordova, is noticed in the preface to Du Cange’s Glossary, and is\r\nrepeated by Velasquez in his History of Spanish Poetry, Dieze’s\r\nedition, page 33.--See also Eichhorn’s _Allgemeine Geschichte der\r\nCultur und Litteratur_, vol. i. p. 121. The details of the history of\r\nArabic poetry in Spain cannot be comprehended in a history of Spanish\r\nand Portuguese poetry. The bibliographic erudition on the subject of\r\nArabic poetry, which Dieze has displayed in his remarks on Velasquez,\r\ndoes not belong to the subject of this work.\r\n\r\n[6] Velasquez, Dieze, and other authors, furnish information on the\r\nhistory of the Biscayan language and poetry. This language, with the\r\npoetry to which it may have given birth, has had no influence on\r\nliterature beyond its own territory, and appears to have had very\r\nlittle even there.\r\n\r\n[7] How sensibly the neglect of the Catalonian or Valencian tongue,\r\nafter the union of the kingdoms of Arragon and Castile, was felt in\r\nthe provinces which belonged to the former, may be seen from the\r\npassage quoted by Eichhorn, in his _Allg. Gesch. der Cul. u. Litt._\r\nvol. i. page 129, from Scuolano’s History of Valencia. But the\r\npleasing language of the Troubadours was doubtless very defective.\r\nIt would otherwise have been difficult to have made the Catalonian\r\npoets so soon proselytes to the Castilian dialect, especially as,\r\nbesides the difference of language, the natural jealousy between the\r\nArragonian and Castilian provinces was strong enough to manifest\r\nitself by political effects even in the eighteenth century. The\r\nimperfection of the Troubadour phraseology may have been partly owing\r\nto its fluctuations, and the various forms it assumed, in the several\r\ndialects. The difference of the dialects appears particularly evident\r\non comparing the real PROVENÇAL of the French Troubadours\r\nwith the Valencian, called LENGUA VALLENCIANA. The dialect of\r\nthe Provençal Troubadours may, without much difficulty, be translated\r\nby conjecture, if the reader be acquainted with French and Italian;\r\nbut the meaning of the Valencian cannot be so easily guessed at, even\r\nwith the additional knowledge of Castilian. As a proof of this, it\r\nwill be sufficient to peruse a passage of the _Libre de los Dones_,\r\nof _Mosen_, [that is, Monsieur, instead of the Castilian Don] _Jaume_\r\n[James] _Roig_, reprinted in Valencia, 1735, in 4to. The author is one\r\nof the last poets who wrote in the Valencian dialect, and the whole\r\ndidactic poem, if so it may be called, is composed in short verses of\r\nthe following description:\r\n\r\n    Yo com absent\r\n    Del mon vivint,\r\n    Aquell linquint\r\n    Aconortat,\r\n    Del apartat\r\n    Dant hi del peu,\r\n    Vell jubileu\r\n    Mort civilment,\r\n    Ja per la gent\r\n    Desconegut,\r\n    Per tots tengut\r\n    Con hom selvatge\r\n    Tenint ostatge, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nOwing to the difference of the dialects, a foreigner might, by a short\r\nresidence in Madrid, learn to express himself in Castilian with more\r\nfluency than it is spoken by a great part of the inhabitants of the\r\nArragonian provinces.\r\n\r\n[8] At least such is the opinion of Gregorio Mayans y Ziscar, given in\r\nhis work, known under the title of _Origenes de la Lengua Española_,\r\npart i. page 8.\r\n\r\n[9] An old prejudice attributes the forcible aspiration which the\r\nSpanish shares in common with the German and Arabic, solely to the\r\nmixture of the latter with the Castilian. This prejudice is pardonable\r\nin the Spaniards, who are not aware of the influence which the German\r\nguttural must have had over their language; but the Germans, who\r\nknow the nature of their mother tongue, ought to recollect that the\r\nsame Arabic words which are strongly aspirated by the Spaniards, are\r\npronounced by the Portuguese, though equally naturalized among them,\r\nwith a hissing sound. Besides, how does it happen that the G\r\nbefore E and I, which is a guttural with the Germans,\r\nhas nearly the same sound with the Castilians, though it is never so\r\npronounced by any other people whose language appears to have risen on\r\nthe ruins of that of ancient Rome? The Germanic pronunciation of the\r\nVisigoths, which was doubtless preserved in the mountains of Castile,\r\nwould afterwards be easily confounded with the Arabic. The Castilian\r\nconversion of O into UE, also resembles the change\r\nwhich takes place in German of O into OE. Let, for\r\ninstance, the Spanish CUERPO and PUEBLO be compared\r\nwith the German KÖRPER and PÖBEL.\r\n\r\n[10] The Portuguese language would perhaps be less depreciated by the\r\nSpaniards, if it did not remind them of the vulgar idiom spoken by the\r\nGalician water-carriers in Madrid. On the contrary, the Portuguese\r\nthink the Castilian language inflated, and at the same time rough\r\nand also affected. Both nations are as little disposed to come to an\r\nagreement on the merits of their respective languages as the Danes and\r\nSwedes are regarding theirs; for the Castilian and Portuguese are,\r\nlike the Danish and Swedish, only two conflicting dialects of the same\r\ntongue. The Swedes admit that the Danish language exceeds their own\r\nin softness, though they consider that softness disagreeable, and the\r\nharsher Swedish more sonorous on account of the greater abundance and\r\nfulness of its vowel sounds; thus, precisely in the same manner, do the\r\nSpaniards condemn the softness of the Portuguese tongue. The elision\r\nof the letter L in a great number of Portuguese words, as in\r\nCOR, PAÇO, for _color_, _palacio_, and the remarkable\r\nchange of L into R, as in _branco_, _brando_, for\r\n_blanco_, _blando_, are peculiarities of that language to which\r\nforeigners do not easily reconcile themselves.\r\n\r\n[11] The first essay towards a history of the Portuguese language,\r\nand an introduction to Portuguese orthography, were published in\r\nLisbon at the time when Portugal was a Spanish province.--Duarte Nunez\r\nde Liaõ, the author of both works, was a statesman and magistrate.\r\n(_Desembargador da Camara da Supplicaçaõ._) The former is entitled\r\n_Origem da Lingoa Portugueza_, _Lisb._ 1606, in 8vo. It is dedicated\r\nto Philip III. king of Spain, who is, however, on this occasion merely\r\naddressed as _Dom Phelipe II. de Portugal_. In the preface the author\r\nstates his other, but older work, (_Orthographia da Lingoa Portugueza_,\r\nLisb. 1576, in 8vo.) to be the first of the kind. The Portuguese have,\r\nhowever, for two centuries laboured with as little success as the\r\nGermans, to introduce uniformity of orthography into their language.\r\nThe convertible M and AÕ appear to have been so early\r\nselected to denote the French nasal tone which occurs in numerous final\r\nsyllables, that Nunez de Liaõ found it necessary to acquiesce in the\r\ncustom, according to which the same word might be very differently\r\nwritten, as _naçaõ_ or _naçam_, _naõ_ or _nam_, pronounced nearly as\r\n_nassaong_ and _naong_, with the French sound of _on_, _bon_. But it\r\nsurely could not have been very difficult to dispossess the totally\r\nunnecessary and barbarous H in _hum_ and _huma_ (from the\r\nlatin _unus_ and _una_) of the place it had assumed, as it is now\r\nbanished from elegant Portuguese orthography. Trifles of this kind\r\npresent more materials for reflection than a first view gives reason\r\nto expect. When the orthography of a country continues to be an object\r\nof reform, that nation is deficient in a certain degree of refinement,\r\nthe attainment of which has either been missed, or the right pursuit\r\nof which is but just commenced. Indeed what necessity is there for the\r\nFrench, Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese, writing the same sound,\r\noccurring in the same word, in four different ways, as for example,\r\n_bataille_, _battaglia_, _batalla_, _batalha_?\r\n\r\n[12] Nothing could be more improper than to follow Du Cange, (Glossar.\r\npraef. § 34, sq.) in dividing the _vulgare idioma_ of the present\r\ninhabitants of the Pyrenean Peninsula into the _Castellanum_,\r\n_Limosinum_, and _Vasconicum_.\r\n\r\n[13] A particular account of the Limosin poetry, even in its last\r\nperiod, which is late enough to come into the division of time called\r\nthe latter ages, does not belong to the history of modern poetry. It\r\nought to be treated as the last part of the chivalrous poetry of the\r\nmiddle ages.--See the notices in Velasquez and Dieze, p. 45, and the\r\nstill more instructive sketch of the history of Limosin poetry, in\r\nEichhorn’s _Gesch. der Cult. u. Litt._ vol. i. p. 123.\r\n\r\n[14] That the Portuguese and the Galician were originally not to be\r\ndistinguished from each other, is expressly stated by that attentive\r\nobserver of the forms of his native language, Nunez de Liaõ, who says,\r\n_As quaes ambas_, (namely, the Portuguese and the Galician tongues)\r\n_eraõ antigamente quasi huma mesma nas palavras, e diphthongos, e\r\npronunciação, que as outras partes de Hespanha naõ tem_. ORIGEM DA\r\nLINGOA PORTUGUEZA, cap. VI.\r\n\r\n[15] Velasquez, who felt this, thought fit when he read the _Lusiade de\r\nCamões_, to pay a particular compliment to the author, at the expense\r\nof the Portuguese language; for, after delivering the same opinion\r\non that language, which is entertained by most Spaniards, he very\r\nelegantly adds: “the muses thought otherwise when they spoke through\r\nthe mouth of Camoens.”\r\n\r\n[16] _Cada fuente de Portugal y cada monte son Hippocrenes y\r\nParnassos_, says Manuel de Faria y Sousa, in his _Epitome de las\r\nHistorias Portugueses_. Father Sarmiento, a Spanish author, whom\r\nnational prejudice does not prevent from doing justice to the\r\nPortuguese, mentions this observation in his instructive _Memorias para\r\nla Poesia Española_.\r\n\r\n[17] The word is used in this extensive sense by Sarmiento in his\r\n_Memorias_, or as the book is sometimes called, _Obras posthumas_,\r\nparte i. p. 168. Authors are far from being agreed respecting the\r\norigin of the term _redondillas_, (according to the Portuguese\r\northography _redondilhas_.) But is not the word more naturally derived\r\nfrom _redondo_ (round), than from a small town called Redondo? Instead\r\nof redondillas, these compositions are sometimes named _redondillos_,\r\nthe word _versos_ being understood. In German they might be called\r\n_ringelverse_ (circular verses.)\r\n\r\n[18] Shall it be said that there is, in the German language, no kind\r\nof verse which unites to so much grace, a character so truly popular!\r\nLet Burger’s _Nachtfeier der Venus_ be considered, before this be\r\ndetermined. Even the Esthonian Serfs, on the coast of the Baltic,\r\nchaunt their simple ballads in the same measure. Proof of this may be\r\nseen on reference to Petri’s _Nachrichten von den Esthen_, vol. ii. p.\r\n69.\r\n\r\n[19] Among others, Sarmiento, who in support of this opinion,\r\nquotes some verses from Virgil, for example: _Inter viburna\r\ncupressi_--_Tondenti barba cadebat_, &c. These verses have, it is true,\r\neight syllables, but not four trochaic feet.\r\n\r\n[20] How does it happen that none of the Spanish authors have taken\r\nnotice of the ancient songs sung by the Roman soldiers, though they\r\nare evidently _redondillas_? Suetonius has preserved some remarkable\r\nexamples of these songs; and the same measure occurs after the decline\r\nof latin poetry, particularly in some pious verses of Prudentius, which\r\nare quoted by Sarmiento.\r\n\r\n[21] After examining Arabic verses, written in the European manner, it\r\ncannot be difficult, even for persons unacquainted with the language,\r\nto form a sufficient idea of the influence which the monotonic rhymes\r\nof the Moors had on the old Castilian romances. See, for example, the\r\nfollowing passage of the Koran:\r\n\r\n    Va sciamsi, va dhohàha,\r\n    Val Kamari eda talàha,\r\n    Van nahari, eda giallàha,\r\n    Val Laïli eda jagsciàha.\r\n\r\nBut the Spanish ear required some variety, and accordingly preferred a\r\npredominant to a single unchanging rhyme. Thus in the romance:--\r\n\r\n    Media noche era por hilo;\r\n    Los gallos querian _cantar_\r\n    Donde Claros con amores\r\n    No podia _reposar_,\r\n    Quanto muy grandes sospiros\r\n    Que el amor se hazia _dar_, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n[22] Such _rimas asonantes_ as occur in the words _noble_ and _pone_,\r\n_dolor_ and _corazon_, are easily recognized. But from some old Spanish\r\nromances, it appears that the return of the same consonants sometimes\r\nsupplies the place of an assonant rhyme; for example, when the words\r\n_baxo_, _crucifixo_, _enojo_, &c. follow each other at short intervals.\r\n\r\n[23] See what is stated by Sarmiento, p. 191, from an old letter of the\r\nMarquis of Santillana, of which more particular notice must soon be\r\ntaken in this work.\r\n\r\n[24] The Spanish and Portuguese _versos de arte mayor_ very much\r\nresemble some of the English popular ballads, with regard to their\r\nmeasure. There is, however, in the rudest of the Spanish and Portuguese\r\nstrophes of this kind, more real rhythmus, than even in the modern\r\npopular songs of the English. An old political song, by Juan de Mena,\r\ncommences thus:--\r\n\r\n    Como, el, que duerme con la pesada,\r\n    Que quiere y no puede jamas acordar,\r\n    Mas si lo puede á la fin desechar,\r\n    Queda la mente con el desvelada, &c.\r\n\r\n[25] Sarmiento has written at sufficient length on the origin of the\r\nCastilian romances, but the information he gives is more copious than\r\nsatisfactory. It would require the most laborious investigation, joined\r\nto the highest critical sagacity, to penetrate the obscurity in which\r\nthis part of the history of literature is involved. How indeed can it\r\nbe ascertained to what age a ballad belongs, the author of which is\r\nunknown, and which, in the progressive improvement of the language and\r\nthe national taste, has been, without scruple, altered by the singers?\r\n\r\n[26] These monuments of old Castilian rhyme were little known until\r\nrescued from oblivion in 1775 by the publication of D. Thomas Antonio\r\nSanchez’s _Coleccion de Poesias Castellanas Anteriores al siglo XV._\r\na work which in respect to philology is certainly very meritorious.\r\nThe collection, however, appears to terminate with the third volume,\r\n(Madrid, 1782), which contains the _Poema de Alexandra Magno_. The\r\nfirst volume contains the celebrated letter of the _Marquis de\r\nSantillana_ on the ancient Spanish poetry, which, for the first time,\r\nis printed in that volume, with a commentary by the publisher, full of\r\nphilological learning.\r\n\r\n[27] For example, in the following passage which Sarmiento has also\r\nquoted; the language, too, differs less from the present Spanish in\r\nthis, than in many other parts of the work.\r\n\r\n    De los sus ojos tan fuertemente llorando,\r\n    Tornaba la cabeça, e estavalos catando.\r\n    Vio puertas abiertas, e uzos sin canados,\r\n    Alcandaras vacìas sin pieles e sin mantos\r\n    E sin falcones, e sin azores, mudados.\r\n    Sospirò mio Zid; ca mucho aviè grandes cuidados.\r\n    Fablò mio Zid bien, e tan mejorado:\r\n    Grado á ti, Señor Padre, que estas en alto.\r\n    Esto me han envuelto mìs enemigos malos, &c.\r\n\r\n[28] He states at the beginning of the work the importance he placed on\r\nthe labour of the rhyme, which he seems to have particularly valued,\r\nbecause he made four lines always rhyme together in succession:--\r\n\r\n    Mester trago fremoso, no es de juglaria,\r\n    Mester es sen pecado, ca es de clerecia.\r\n    _Fablar curso rimado por la quaderna via\r\n    Per silabas cantadas, ca es grant maestria._\r\n\r\n[29]\r\n\r\n    El padre a vii. años metiole a leer,\r\n    Diole a maestros ornados de seso e de saber,\r\n    Los megores que pudo in Grecia escoger,\r\n    Que lo sopiessen en las vii. artes emponer\r\n        Aprend de las vii. artes cada dia licion\r\n    De todas cada dia facia disputacion, &c.\r\n\r\n[30] Sarmiento and Sanchez may be consulted respecting those enquiries.\r\nSome notices on the same topics are also to be found in Velasquez. Had\r\nBerceo composed verses on temporal subjects, it is probable that the\r\nSpanish writers would not have disputed with so much zeal on the merits\r\nof his life. It is curious, that the pious author himself calls his\r\nverse prose. The passage runs thus:--\r\n\r\n    Quiero far _una prosa_ in Roman paladino,\r\n    En qual suele el pueblo fablar a su vecino,\r\n    _Ca non so tan letrado a far otro latino_.\r\n    Bien valdra, como ereo, un vaso de bon vino.\r\n\r\n[31] Having stated that he learnt his art from an Egyptian, whom he\r\ninvited from Alexandria, Alphonso adds:--\r\n\r\n    La piedra que llaman philosophal\r\n    Sabia facer, e me la enseñó,\r\n    Fizimoslo juntos, despues solo yo;\r\n    Con que muchas veces creció mi caudal.\r\n\r\nThe chemical prescriptions have a very quaint effect, as delivered in\r\nthe dancing measure of these verses, viz.\r\n\r\n    Tomad el mercurio assi como sale\r\n    De minas de tierra con limpia pureza.\r\n    Purgadlo con cueros par la su maleza,\r\n    Porque mas limpieza en esto mi cale.\r\n    E porque su peso tan solo se iguale,\r\n    Con doze onzas del dicho compuesto,\r\n    En vaso de vidro despues de ser puesto.\r\n    Otra materia en esto non vale.\r\n\r\nThis extract may also serve as an example of the rhythmical facility\r\ndisplayed in the verses of Alphonso.\r\n\r\n[32] Histoire générale des Troubadours, tom. ii. pag. 255, tom. iii.\r\npag. 329, &c.\r\n\r\n[33] Sarmiento refers the oldest Castilian romances to the thirteenth\r\ncentury, but only hypothetically, and with the explicit declaration,\r\nthat certainly none were to be found in the form in which they then\r\nexisted. Respecting the _Nicolas_ and the _Antonio de los Romances_,\r\nsee the notes of Dieze on Velasquez, p. 146.\r\n\r\n[34] See the _Bibliotheca Hispana Vetus_ of Nicolas Antonio, under the\r\nhead of Alphonso XI. and Sarmiento, p. 305.\r\n\r\n[35] A sensible and well digested biography of this prince, by Gonzalo\r\nde Argote y Molina, a writer of the sixteenth century, is prefixed to\r\n_El Conde Lucanor_, the first edition of which Argote superintended.\r\nThe work is not easily procured even in Spain. _No es de los mas\r\ncommunes_, says Sarmiento. In the library of the university of\r\nGöttingen there is a copy of the edition: Madrid, 1642, 4to.\r\n\r\n[36]\r\n\r\n    Si algun bien fizieres, que chico assaz fuere,\r\n    Fazlo granado; que el bien nunca muere.\r\n\r\n[37]\r\n\r\n    Quien te conseja encobrir de tus amigos,\r\n    Engañar te quiere assaz, y sin testigos.\r\n\r\n[38]\r\n\r\n    No aventures mucho tu riqueza\r\n    Por consejo de ome que ha pobreza.\r\n\r\n[39]\r\n\r\n    Quien bien see, non se lieve.\r\n\r\n[40]\r\n\r\n    Quien te alabare con lo que non has en ti,\r\n    Sabe, que quiere relever lo que has de ti.\r\n\r\n[41] As this work is as scarce as it is curious, to extract the whole\r\nof the first tale will perhaps be agreeable to the reader. Fablava\r\nun dia el Conde Lucanor con Patronio su Consejero, en esta manera.\r\nPatronio, vos sabedes que yo soy muy caçador, y he fecho muchas\r\ncaças nuevas, que nunca fizo otro ome, y aun he fecho y añadido en\r\nlos capillos y en las piguelas algunas cosas muy aprovechosas, que\r\nnunca fueron fechas, y aora los que quieren dezir mal de mi fablan\r\nen escarnio en alguna manera, y quando loan al Cid Ruydias, o al\r\nConde Ferrand Gonzalez, de quantas lides que fizieron, o al santo y\r\nbienaventurado Rey don Ferrando, quantas buenas conquistas fizo, loan\r\na mi, diziendo que fiz muy buen fecho, porque añadi aquello en los\r\ncapillos y en las piguelas. Y porque yo entiendo, que este alabamiento\r\nmas se me torna en denuesto, que en alabamiento, ruego vos que me a\r\nconsejedes en que manera faré, porque no me escarnezcan por la buena\r\nobra que fiz. Señor Conde, dixo Patronio, para que vos sepades lo\r\nque vos cumple de fazer en esto, plazeme ya que sopiessedes lo que\r\ncontescio a un moro, que fue Rey de Cordova. El Conde la preguntó como\r\nfuera aquello; Patronio le dixo assi.\r\n\r\nHuvo en Cordova un Rey Moro, que huvo nombre Alhaquime, y como quier\r\nque mantenia bien assaz su Reyno, no se trabajó de fazer otra cosa\r\nhonrada, nin de gran fama, de las que suelen y deven fazer los Reyes.\r\nCa non tan solamente son los Reyes tenudos de guardar sus Reynos, mas\r\nlos que buenos quieren ser, conviene que tales obras fagan, porque\r\ncon derecho acrecienten sus Reynos, y fagan en guisa, que en su vida\r\nsean muy mas loados de las gentes, y despues de su muerte finqueen\r\nbuenas fazañas de las obras que ellos ovieren fecho. E este Rey non\r\nse trabajava de esto, si non de comer, y de folgar, y de estar en su\r\ncasa vicioso; y acaescio, que estando un dia que tañian ante el un\r\nestormento de que se pagavan mucho los moros, que há nombre Albogon,\r\ne el Rey paró mientes, y entendio que non fazia tan buen son como\r\nera menester, y tomó el Albogon, y añadio en el un forado a la parte\r\nde yuso, en derecho de los otros forados, y dende en adelante fazia\r\nel Albogon muy mejor son que fasta entonces fazia. E comoquiera que\r\naquello era bien fecho para en aquella cosa, pero que non era tan\r\ngran fecho como convenia de fazer al Rey. E las gentes en manera de\r\nescarnio començaron a loar aquel fecho, y dezian quando llamavan a\r\nalguno en Arabigo, _Vahedezut Alhaquime_, que quiere dezir: este es\r\nel añadimiento del Rey Alhaquime. Esta palabra fue sonada tanto por\r\nla tierra, fasta que lo ovo de oir el Rey, y preguntó, porque dezian\r\nlas gentes aqueste palabra. E conaquier que ge lo quisieran negar y\r\nencubrir, tanto los afincó, que ge lo ovieron a dezir. E desque esto\r\noyó tomó ende gran peçar, pero como era muy buen Rey, non quiso fazer\r\nmal a los que dezian aquesta palabra, mas puso en su coraçon de facer\r\notro añadimiento, de que por fuerza oviessen las gentes a loar el su\r\nfecho. E entonce porque la su mezquita de Cordova non era acabada,\r\nañadio en ella aquel Rey toda la labor que hi menguava, y acabóla.\r\nY esto fue la mejor, y mas complida, y mas noble mesquita que los\r\nmoros avian en España. E loado Dios es aora Iglesia, y llamanla Santa\r\nMaria de Cordova, y ofresciola el santo Rey don Fernando a Santa\r\nMaria quando ganó a Cordova de los Moros. E desque aquel Rey ovo\r\nacabado la mesquita, y fecho aquel tan buen añadimiento, dixo, que\r\npues fasta entonces lo avian a escarnio, retrayendole del añadimiento\r\nque fiziera en el Albogon, que tenia que de alli adelante le avrian a\r\nloar con razon del añadimiento que fiziera en la mezquita de Cordova,\r\ny fue despues muy loado: y el loamiento que fasta entonces le fazian\r\nescarnesciendole, fincò despues por loa, y oy dia dizen los Moros\r\nquando quieren loar algun buen hecho:--Este es el añadimiento del Rey\r\nAlhaquime. E vos, Señor Conde, si tomades pesar, o cuidades que vos\r\nloan por escarnescer del añadimiento, que fezistes en los capillos, y\r\nen las piguelas, y en las otras cosas de caça que vos fezistes, guisad\r\nde fazer algunos fechos granados e nobles que les pertenesce de facer\r\na los grandes omes. E por fuerça las gentes avran de loar los vuestros\r\nbuenos fechos, assi como loan aora por escarnio en el añadimiento que\r\nfezistes de la caça. E el Conde tovo este por buen consejo y fizolo\r\nassí, e fallose dello muy bien. E porque don Juan entendio que esta era\r\nbuen exemplo, fizolo escrivir en este libro, y fizo estos versos, que\r\ndizen assi:\r\n\r\n    Si algun bien fizieres, que chico asaz fuere,\r\n    Fazlo granado, que el bien nunca muere.\r\n\r\n[42] Thus in the first stories the old word _ome_ stands for _hombre_;\r\nbut in those towards the end of the collection it is changed to\r\n_hombre_.\r\n\r\n[43] Argote y Molina enumerates the prose works of this prince in the\r\nbefore-mentioned biography. He notices the poems in an appendix to\r\nhis edition of _El Conde Lucanor_, entitled _Discurso sobre la poesia\r\nEspañola_. Though the appendix occupies only a few pages, it contains\r\nmany interesting observations.\r\n\r\n[44] The following romance, which is inserted without interpunctuation,\r\nas it appears in the original, may serve for a specimen of those to\r\nwhich the name of Don Juan Manuel is attached. It is certainly not the\r\nworst of its kind; and must have found its way by some lucky accident\r\ninto the _Cancionero general_, which contains scarcely any narrative\r\nromances. It is also found in another _Cancionero de Romances_, under\r\nthe title of _Romance de Don Juan Manuel_.\r\n\r\n    Gritando va el cavallero\r\n    publicando su gran mal\r\n    vestidas ropas de luto\r\n    aforrados en sayal\r\n    por los montes sin camino\r\n    con dolor y sospirar\r\n    llorando a pie descalço\r\n    jurando de no tornar\r\n    adonde viesse mugeres\r\n    por nunca se consolar\r\n    con otro nuevo cuydado\r\n    que le hiziesse olividar\r\n    la memoria de sua amiga\r\n    que murio sin la gozar\r\n    va buscar las tierras solas\r\n    para en ellas habitar\r\n    en una montaña espesa\r\n    no cercana de lugar\r\n    hizo casa de tristura\r\n    qu’es dolor de la nombrar\r\n    d’una madera amarilla\r\n    que llaman desesperar\r\n    paredes de canto negro\r\n    y tambien negra la cal\r\n    las tejas puso leonadas\r\n    sobre tablas de besar\r\n    el suelo hizo de plomo\r\n    porque es pardillo metal\r\n    las puertas chapadas dello\r\n    por su trabajo mostrar\r\n    y sembro por cima el suelo\r\n    secas hojas deparral\r\n    cado no se esperan bienes\r\n    esperança no ha destar\r\n    en aquesta casa escura\r\n    que hizo para penar\r\n    haze mas estrecha vida\r\n    que los frayles del paular\r\n    que duermen sobre sarmientos\r\n    y aquellos son su maniar\r\n    lo que llora es lo que beve\r\n    aquello torna a llorar\r\n    no mas d’una vez al dia\r\n    por mas se debilitar\r\n    del color de la madera\r\n    mando una pared pintar\r\n    un dosel de blanca seda\r\n    en ella mando parar\r\n    y de muy blanco alabastro\r\n    hizo labrar un altar\r\n    con canfora betumado\r\n    de raso blanco el frontal\r\n    puso el bulto de su amiga\r\n    en el para le adorar\r\n    el cuerpo de plata fina\r\n    el rostro era de cristal\r\n    un brial vestido blanco\r\n    de damasco singular\r\n    mongil de blanco brocado\r\n    forrado en blanco cendal\r\n    sembrado de lunas llenas\r\n    señal de casta final\r\n    en la cabeça le puso\r\n    una corona real\r\n    guarnecida de castañas\r\n    cogidas del castañal\r\n    lo que dize la castaña\r\n    es cosa muy de notar\r\n    las cinco letras primeras\r\n    el nombre de la sin par\r\n    murio de veynte y dos años\r\n    por mas lastima dexar\r\n    la su gentil hermosura\r\n    quien quel sepa loar\r\n    qu’es mayor que la tristura\r\n    del que la mando pintar\r\n    en lo qu’ el passa su vida\r\n    es en la siempre mirar\r\n    cerro la puerta al plazer\r\n    abrio la puerta al pesar\r\n    abrio la para quedarse\r\n    pero no para tornar.\r\n\r\nAll the songs attributed to Don Juan Manuel in the _Cancionera_ have a\r\nform and structure, which render it probable that they belong to the\r\nage in which _El Conde Lucanor_ was written; one, for example, begins\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n    Quien por bien servir alcanza\r\n    Vivir triste y desamado,\r\n    Este tal\r\n    Deve tener confianza,\r\n    Que le traera este cuydado\r\n    A mayor mal.\r\n\r\nAnother which belongs to the class, called _Villancios_ possesses more\r\npoetical merit. It commences thus:--\r\n\r\n    Muerto es ya, muerto, Señora,\r\n    El triste que en ley de Amor\r\n    Era vuestro servitor.\r\n        La muerte pudo matalle,\r\n    Pues le distes ocasion,\r\n    Pero no pudo quitalle\r\n    De teneros aficion.\r\n    O pena sin redemcion,\r\n    Que pena el triste amador\r\n    En los infiernos de Amor.\r\n\r\n[45] Sarmiento only briefly notices this arch-priest, and Nicolas\r\nAntonio has entirely overlooked him. But Velasquez pays particular\r\nattention to him, and gives a long extract from his work.\r\n\r\n[46] As a specimen by which justice will be done the author, it\r\nis sufficient to quote the following passage, which is printed by\r\nVelasquez. Don Amor says:--\r\n\r\n    Entrada de quaresma viume para Toledo;\r\n    Cuidé estar vicioso, plasentero e ledo.\r\n    Fallé y gran santiadad, e fisome estar quedo.\r\n    Pocos me recibieron, niu me ficieron del dedo.\r\n    Estaba en un palacio pintado de Almagra.\r\n    Vino a me mucho Dueña de mucho aguno magra\r\n    Con muchos paternostres e con oracion agra, &c.\r\n\r\n[47] The celebrated letter of the Marquis de Santillana, which must\r\nbe more particularly noticed hereafter, contributes its part in\r\nillustrating the history of this period. Much however is not to be\r\nlearned from the letter itself. The commentary on it by Sanchez, in\r\nthe first volume of the before-mentioned _Coleccion_, is far more\r\ninstructive.\r\n\r\n[48] Whoever wishes to become acquainted with the controversies on the\r\nearly literature of knight-errantry, should resort to Nicolas Antonio,\r\nand compare what he says with Eichhorn’s learned view of the subject,\r\nincluding the necessary references, in his Allg. Gesch. der Cult. u.\r\nLitt. Theil I. p. 136, &c. Nunez de Liaõ, in his _Origem de Lingoa\r\nPortugueza_, also mentions Lobeira as the author of _Amadis de Gaul_.\r\n\r\n[49] The merit of the Amadis was not overlooked by Cervantes. In the\r\njudgment passed on Don Quixote’s library, the Curate wishes to condemn\r\nthis work first of all to the flames, because, being the parent of all\r\nthe books of knight-errantry in Spain, it was therefore the great cause\r\nof Don Quixote’s malady; but the Barber, or rather Cervantes, speaking\r\nin that character, says, “No, friend; for I have heard it remarked\r\nthat the Amadis is the _best book_ of the kind ever written; it ought\r\ntherefore to be spared as a _peculiar specimen_ of art.” Whoever may\r\nbe desirous of making the Amadis re-appear in a state capable of being\r\nrelished in the present times, must, above all things, take care to\r\npreserve the ingenuous simplicity of the stile, or the work will be\r\nwholly disfigured.\r\n\r\n[50] The titles of all the collections of romances need not be given\r\nhere. A considerable part of them may be found in Velasquez, with\r\nadditions by Dieze, (p. 442, &c.) and Blankenburg’s Zusätzen zu\r\nSulzer’s Wörterbuche. I have before me several collections, which\r\ncontain some of the oldest romances I am acquainted with. The best of\r\nthese collections is entitled: _Cancionero de Romances, en que estan\r\nrecopilados la mayor parte de los Romances Castellanos, que hasta agora\r\nse han compuesto._ Nuevamento corregido _y añadido en muchos partes.\r\nAnvers_ 1555, 8vo. In the well known _Romancero general_ none of the\r\npieces which derive their materials from knight-errantry romances are\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\n[51] The following romance, derived from that work, gives an artless\r\ndescription of the sufferings of Amadis on the barren rock.\r\n\r\n    En la selva esta Amadis\r\n    el _leal enamorado_\r\n    tal vida estava haziendo\r\n    qual nunca hizo Christiano\r\n    cilicio trae vestido\r\n    a sus carnes apretado\r\n    con diciplinas destruye\r\n    su cuerpo muy delicado\r\n    llagado de las heridas\r\n    y en su señora pensando\r\n    no ce canoce en su gesto\r\n    segun lo trae delgado\r\n    de ayunos y d’abstinencias\r\n    andava debilitado\r\n    la barva trae crecida\r\n    deste mundo se ha apartado\r\n    las rodillas tiene en tierra\r\n    y en su coraçon echado\r\n    con gran humildad os pide\r\n    perdon si avia errado\r\n    al alto dios poderoso\r\n    por testigo ha publicado\r\n    y acordado se le avia\r\n    del amor suyo passado\r\n    que assi le derribo\r\n    de su sentido y estado\r\n    con estas grandes passiones\r\n    amortecido ha quedado\r\n    el mas leal amador\r\n    que en el mundo fue hallado.\r\n\r\n[52] According to Sarmiento (p. 228,) it is usual to say, _Este no vale\r\nlas coplas de Calainos_. But it is not therefore to be inferred, that\r\nthe ancient romance of that name is the worst of the kind.\r\n\r\n[53] It will be sufficient to cite, in support of this opinion, the\r\nromance of the _Conde Alarcos_, which is, besides, distinguished from\r\nmost of the other romances by greater richness of composition. It opens\r\nin a very simple manner with a description of the sorrow of the Infante\r\nSolesa, who, after being secretly betrothed to Count Alarcos, has been\r\nabandoned by him.\r\n\r\n      Retraida està la Infanta\r\n      Bien assi como salia,\r\n      Viviendo muy descontenta\r\n      De la vida que tenia,\r\n      Vienda ya que se pasava\r\n      Toda la flor de su vida.\r\n\r\n    The fair Infanta midst the court\r\n    A look of sorrow wears,\r\n    Told by an aching heart how she\r\n    Is doom’d to pass her years;\r\n    For far from her is ever flown\r\n    The early bloom of life----\r\n\r\nAt length, after Count Alarcos has been long married, the forsaken\r\nprincess discloses her seduction to her father. This scene is strongly\r\npainted, but not overcharged: the king is transported by rage and\r\nindignation; his honour appears to him so wounded, that nothing but\r\nthe death of the Countess can be a sufficient satisfaction. He has an\r\ninterview with the Count, addresses him courteously, represents the\r\ncase to him with chivalrous dignity as a point of justice and honour,\r\nand concludes by categorically demanding the death of his lady. Thus\r\nthe developement of the story commences in a manner, which, though most\r\nsingular, is perhaps not unnatural, when the ideas of the age to which\r\nthe composition belongs are considered. The Count conceives himself\r\nbound as a man of honour to give the king the satisfaction he desires.\r\nHe promises to comply with his demand, and proceeds on his way home.\r\nThere is a touching simplicity in the picture which is here drawn.\r\n\r\n      Llorando se parte el Conde,\r\n      Llorando, sin alegria,\r\n      Llorando a la Condessa,\r\n      Que mas que a sì la queria.\r\n      Lloraba tambien el Conde\r\n      Por tres hijos que tenia,\r\n      El una era de teta,\r\n      Que la Condessa lo cria,\r\n      Que no queria mamar\r\n      De tres amas, que tenia,\r\n      Sino era de su madre.\r\n\r\n    Weeping he homeward wends his way,\r\n    His grief nought can remove,\r\n    Because his tears are shed for her\r\n    He more than life doth love.\r\n    He weepeth too for his three sons,\r\n    In youth and beauty dear;\r\n    The youngest boy a suckling still,\r\n    The Countess’ self doth rear.\r\n    For, save his mother, none he lov’d,\r\n    Though he had nurses three,\r\n    Nor by the milk of other breasts\r\n    Would alimented be.\r\n\r\nThe pathetic interest now rises gradually to the highest pitch of\r\ntragic horror. The Countess, who receives her husband with the wonted\r\nmarks of affection, in vain enquires the cause of his melancholy. He\r\nsits down to supper with his family, and again we have a situation\r\npainted with genuine feeling, though with little art.\r\n\r\n      Sentose el Conde a la mesa,\r\n      No cenava, ni podia,\r\n      Con sus hijos al costado,\r\n      Que muy mucho los queria.\r\n      Echo se sobre los hombros,\r\n      Hizo, como se dormia,\r\n      De lagrimas de sus ojos\r\n      Toda la mesa cubria.\r\n\r\n    The board is laid, he takes his place,\r\n    Where viands tempt in vain,\r\n    For near him his lov’d children are,\r\n    Now lov’d, alas! with pain.\r\n    In seeming sleep with head reclin’d,\r\n    He tries to hide his woe;\r\n    But from his eyes the big tears roll,\r\n    And o’er the table flow.\r\n\r\nThe apparent fatigue of the Count induces the Countess to accompany him\r\nto his apartment. When they enter, the Count fastens the door, relates\r\nwhat has passed, and desires his lady to prepare for death.\r\n\r\n      De morir aveis, Condessa,\r\n      Antes que amenesca el dia.\r\n\r\n    O Countess, thou art doom’d to die,\r\n    Before the morning’s dawn.\r\n\r\nShe begs him to spare her only for her children’s sake. The Count\r\ndesires her to embrace for the last time the youngest, whom she has\r\nbrought with her into the room asleep in her arms.\r\n\r\n      Abrazad este chiquito,\r\n      Que aquesto es el que os perdia.\r\n      Peso me de vos, Condessa,\r\n      Quanta pesar me podia.\r\n\r\n    Give to that babe one parting kiss,\r\n    That babe for whom thou’rt lost;\r\n    Beshrew me--but I pity thee--\r\n    I who need pity most.\r\n\r\nShe submits to her hard fate, and only asks for time to say an _ave\r\nmaria_. The Count desires her to be quick. She falls on her knees, and\r\npours forth a brief but fervent prayer; she then requests a few moments\r\nmore delay, that she may once more give suck to her infant son. What\r\nmodern poet would have thought of introducing so exquisite a touch of\r\nnature? The Count forbids her to wake the child. The unfortunate lady\r\nforgives her husband, but predicts that, within thirty days, the king\r\nand his daughter will be summoned before the tribunal of the Almighty.\r\nThe Count strangles her.\r\n\r\n    Echole por la garganta\r\n    Una toca que tenia,\r\n    Apreto con los dos manos,\r\n    Con la fuerza que podia.\r\n    No le afloxo la garganta,\r\n    Mentre que vida tenia.\r\n\r\nIn the conclusion, the fulfilment of the unfortunate Countess’s\r\nprophecy is briefly related. On the twelfth day the princess died, on\r\nthe twentieth the king, and on the thirtieth the Count himself expired.\r\n\r\n[54] Those in the _Cancionero de Romances_ are of this kind. (See the\r\nremark, p. 35.)\r\n\r\n[55] Sarmiento counted one hundred and two romances relative to\r\nthe Cid, in one collection. Only some of them are inserted in the\r\n_Romancero general_, interspersed among others.\r\n\r\n[56] In the following romance, for instance, the assonance is very\r\nskilfully managed.\r\n\r\n    Fizo hazer al Rey Alfonso\r\n    el Cid un solene juro,\r\n    delante de muchos Grandes,\r\n    que se hallaron en Burgos.\r\n    Mandò que con el viniessen\r\n    doze cavalleros juntos,\r\n    para que con el jurassen,\r\n    cada qual uno por uno.\r\n    Por la muerte de su Rey,\r\n    que le mataron seguro,\r\n    en el cerco de Zamora,\r\n    a traycion junto del muro.\r\n    Y quando en el templo santo\r\n    estuvieron todos juntos\r\n    levantose de su escaño,\r\n    y el Cid aquesto propuso.\r\n    Por aquesta santa casa\r\n    donde estamos en de ayuso,\r\n    que fabledes la verdad,\r\n    de aquesto que aqui os pregunto.\r\n    Si fuystes vos Rey la causa,\r\n    o de los vuestros alguno,\r\n    en la muerte de don Sancho\r\n    tengays la muerto que tuvo!\r\n    Todos responden Amen,\r\n    mas el Rey quedò confuso,\r\n    pero por cumplir el voto,\r\n    respondio, la mismo juro.\r\n    Y con la rodilla en tierra\r\n    por fazer su cortes uso,\r\n    el Cid delante del Rey,\r\n    assi le fablò sañudo.\r\n    Si ayer no os besa la mano,\r\n    sabed Rey que non me plugo,\r\n    y si aora os la besare\r\n    será de mí grado, y gusto.\r\n    Aquesto que aqui he fablado\r\n    no ha fecho agravio a ninguno,\r\n    porque lo devo a don Sancho\r\n    como buen vassallo suyo.\r\n    Pero sino lo fiziera\r\n    que dara yo por injusto,\r\n    y no por buen cavallero,\r\n    me tuvieran en el mundo.\r\n    Y si ha parecido mal\r\n    a los de vuesso consulto,\r\n    en el campo los aguardo,\r\n    con mi espada, y lança en puño.\r\n\r\n[57] Of this kind is the following romance, in which the Cid takes\r\nleave of Ximena. It is obviously one of the more modern.\r\n\r\n    Al arma, al arma sonavan\r\n    los pifaros y atambores,\r\n    guerra, fuego, sangre dizen\r\n    sus espantosos clamores:\r\n    el Cid apresta su gente,\r\n    todos se ponen en orden\r\n    quando llorosa y humilde,\r\n    le dize Ximena Gomez:\r\n        Rey de mi alma, y desta tierra Conde,\r\n        porque me dexas? donde vas, a donde?\r\n\r\n    Que sì eres marte en la guerra,\r\n    eres Apolo en la Corte,\r\n    donde matas bellas damas,\r\n    como alla Moros feroces.\r\n    Ante tus ojos se postran,\r\n    y de rodillas se ponen\r\n    los Reyes Moros, y hijas,\r\n    de Reyes Christianos nobles,\r\n        Rey de mi alma, &c.\r\n\r\n    Ya truecan todos los guerras,\r\n    por luzidos morriones,\r\n    por arneses de Milan,\r\n    los blandos pechos de Londres,\r\n    las calças por duras grevas,\r\n    por mallas guantas de flores:\r\n    mas nos otros trocaremos\r\n    las almas y coraçones.\r\n        Rey de mi alma, &c.\r\n\r\n    Viendo las duras querellas,\r\n    de su querida consorte,\r\n    no puede sufrir el Cid,\r\n    que no la consuele y llore.\r\n    Enxugad señora, dize,\r\n    los ojos hasta que torne:\r\n    ella mirando los suyos,\r\n    supena publica a vozes.\r\n        Rey de mi alma, &c.\r\n\r\n[58] A zealous orthodox author speaks with much warmth on this subject\r\nin a romance which commences, “Tanta Zayda, y Adalifa.” Among other\r\nthings he says:\r\n\r\n    Renegaron a su ley\r\n    Los romancistes de España,\r\n    Y ofrecieron a Mahoma\r\n    Los primicios de sus gracias.\r\n\r\n[59]\r\n\r\n    Cabelleros Granadinos,\r\n    Aunque moros, hijos d’álgo.\r\n\r\n[60]\r\n\r\n    Las huestes de don Rodrigo\r\n    desmayavan y huyan,\r\n    quando en la octava batalla\r\n    sus enemigos vencian,\r\n    Rodrigo dexa sus tierras\r\n    y del real se salia,\r\n    solo va el desventurado\r\n    que non lleva compañia\r\n    el cavallo de cansado\r\n    ya mudar no se podia,\r\n    camina por donde quiere\r\n    que no le estorva la via\r\n    el rey va tan desmayado\r\n    que sentido no tenía,\r\n    muerto va de sed y hambre\r\n    que de vella era manzilla\r\n    yva tan tinto de sangre\r\n    que una brasa parecia\r\n    las armas lleva abolladas\r\n    que eran de gran pedreria,\r\n    la espada lleva hecha sierra\r\n    de los golpos que tenia.\r\n    el almete de abollado\r\n    en la cabeça se hundia\r\n    la cara llevava hinchada\r\n    del trabajo que sufria,\r\n    subiose encima de un cerro\r\n    al mas alto que veya,\r\n    dende alli mira su gente\r\n    como yva de vencida\r\n    d’alli mira sus vanderas\r\n    y estandartes que tenia,\r\n    como estan todos pisados\r\n    que la tierra los cubria,\r\n    mira por los capitanes\r\n    que ninguno parescia,\r\n    mira el campo tinto en sangre\r\n    la qual arroyos corria\r\n    el triste de ver aquesto\r\n    gran manzilla en si tenia\r\n    llorando de los sus ojos\r\n    desta manera dezia,\r\n    Ayer era Rey d’España\r\n    oy no lo soy de una villa,\r\n    ayer villas y castillos\r\n    oy ninguno posseya,\r\n    ayer tenia criados\r\n    y gente que me servia\r\n    oy no tengo una almena\r\n    que pueda dezir que es mia,\r\n    desdichada fue la hora\r\n    desdichado fue aquel dia\r\n    en que naci y herede\r\n    la tan grande señoria\r\n    pues lo avia de perder\r\n    todo junto y en un dia\r\n    o muerte porque no vienes\r\n    y llevas esta alma mia\r\n    de aqueste cuerpo mezquino\r\n    pues se te agradeceria?\r\n\r\n[61] This is one of the best pieces of the kind.\r\n\r\n    Vitorioso buelve el Cid\r\n    a san Pedro de Cardeña,\r\n    de las guerras que ha tenido\r\n    con los Moros de Valencia.\r\n    Las trompetas van sonando,\r\n    por dar aviso que llega,\r\n    y entre todos se señalan\r\n    los relinchos de Babieca.\r\n    El Abad, y monjes salen\r\n    a recebirlo a la puerta,\r\n    dando alabanças a Dios,\r\n    y al Cid mil enorabuenas.\r\n    Apeose del calvallo,\r\n    y antes de entrar en la Iglesia,\r\n    tomò el pendon en sus manos,\r\n    y dize desta manera.\r\n    Sali de ti templo santo\r\n    desterrado de mi tierra,\r\n    mas ya buelvo a visitarte\r\n    acogido en las agenas.\r\n    Desterrome el Rey Alphonso,\r\n    porque alla en Santagadea\r\n    le tomè el juramento\r\n    con mas rigor que el quisiera.\r\n    Las leyes eran del pueblo,\r\n    que no excedi un punto dellas,\r\n    pues como leal vassallo\r\n    saquè a mi rey desospecha.\r\n    O embidiosos Castellanos,\r\n    quan mal pagays la defensa\r\n    que tuvistes en mi espada,\r\n    ensanchando vuestra cerca.\r\n    Veys aqui os traygo ganado\r\n    otro reyno, y mil fronteras,\r\n    que os quiero dar tierras mias\r\n    aunque me echeys de las vuestras.\r\n    Pudiera dezirlo a estraños,\r\n    mas para cosas tan feas\r\n    soy Rodrigo de Bivar\r\n    Castellano a las derechas.\r\n\r\nThe concluding line:--_Castellano a las derechas_, (the Castilian as\r\nhe ought to be) is a description of the Cid, which was well adapted\r\nto produce an impression on the hearts of the people to whom it was\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\n[62] The following is the commencement of this romance:--\r\n\r\n    De los trofeos de amor\r\n    ya coronadas sus sienes,\r\n    muy gallardo entra Ganzul\r\n    a jugar cañas a Gelves,\r\n    en un hovero furioso,\r\n    que al ayre en su curso excede,\r\n    y en su pujança y rigor\r\n    un leve freno detiene.\r\n    La librea de los pajes\r\n    es roxa, morada, y verde,\r\n    divisa cierta y colores\r\n    de la que en su alma tiene:\r\n    todos con lanças leonadas\r\n    en corredores ginetes,\r\n    adornados de penachos,\r\n    y de costosos jaezes:\r\n    el mismo se trae la adarga,\r\n    en quien un fenix parece,\r\n    que en vivas llamas se abrasa,\r\n    y en ceniza se resuelve;\r\n    la letra si bien me acuerdo,\r\n    dize: Es inconveniente\r\n    poderse dissimular\r\n    el fuego que amor enciende, &c.\r\n\r\n[63]\r\n\r\n    El que poblò las masmorras\r\n    De Christianos Caballeros.\r\n\r\n[64] The subjoined passage forms the latter part of this romance.\r\n\r\n    La hermosissima Balaja,\r\n    que llorosa en su aposento\r\n    las sinrazones del Rey\r\n    le pagavan sus cabellos\r\n    como tanto estruendo oyò\r\n    a un valcon salio corriendo,\r\n    y enmudecida le dixo,\r\n    dando vozes con silencio:\r\n    Vete en paz, que no vas solo,\r\n    y en mi ausencia ten consuelo,\r\n    que quien te echò de Xerez,\r\n    vno te echara de mi pecho:\r\n    El con la vista responde,\r\n    yo me voy, y no te dexo.\r\n    De las agravios de Rey\r\n    para tu firmeza a pelo,\r\n    Con esto passò la calle,\r\n    los ojos atras bolviendo\r\n    dos mil vezes: y de Andujar\r\n    tomò el camino derecho.\r\n\r\n[65] Such, for example, is the following ludicrous description of\r\nHector’s funeral.\r\n\r\n    En las obsequias de Hector\r\n    esta la reyna Troyana\r\n    con la linda Policena\r\n    y con otras muchas damas\r\n    tambien estavan los Griegos\r\n    sino Achiles que faltava\r\n    que fue a la postre de todos\r\n    y en el tempo se assentava\r\n    frontero la reyna Elena\r\n    que por Hector lamentava\r\n    mirando su hermosura\r\n    con gran cuydado pensava\r\n    si Menelao no fuera\r\n    rey Griego la conquistara\r\n    para casarse con ella\r\n    segun era muy loçana\r\n    y assí triste y pensativo\r\n    no podia echar la habla\r\n    quando miro a Policena\r\n    en la coraçon le pesara, &c.\r\n\r\n[66]\r\n\r\n    Con ravia esta el rey David\r\n    rasgando su coraçon\r\n    sabiendo que alli en la lid\r\n    le mataron a Absalon\r\n    cubriose la su cabeça\r\n    y subiose a un mirador\r\n    con lagrimas de sus ojos\r\n    sus canas regadas son\r\n    hablando de la su boca\r\n    dize esta lamentacion\r\n    _o fili mi fili mi\r\n    o fili mi Absalon_\r\n    que es de la tu hermosura\r\n    tu estremada perficion\r\n    los tus cabellos dorados\r\n    parecian rayos de sol\r\n    tus ojos lindos azules\r\n    que jacinta de Sion\r\n    o manos que tal hizieron\r\n    enemigos de razon, &c.\r\n\r\nAny person who in those times was capable of making redondilla verses,\r\nmust have found it very easy to produce such romances as this.\r\n\r\n[67] _No vale las coplas de la Sarabanda_, is a proverb of precisely\r\nthe same signification as--_No vale las coplas de Calainos_, according\r\nto Sarmiento. See the remark, page 55. The two proverbs have probably\r\nbeen confounded, for the romance of Calainos is not in coplas.\r\n\r\n[68] The following is one of those pieces which may be regarded as\r\nuntranslatable.\r\n\r\n    Rosafresca Rosafresca\r\n    tan garrida y con amor\r\n    quando y’os tuve en mis braços\r\n    no os sabia servir no\r\n    y agora que os servira\r\n    no os puedo yo averno.\r\n    Vuestra fue la culpa amigo\r\n    vuestra fue que mia no\r\n    embiastes me una carta\r\n    con un vuestro servidor\r\n    y en lugar de recaudar\r\n    el dixera otra razon\r\n    qu’erades casado amigo\r\n    alla en tierras de Leon\r\n    que teneys muger hermosa\r\n    y hijos como una flor.\r\n    Quien os lo dixo señora\r\n    no os dixera verdad no\r\n    que yo nunca entre en Castilla\r\n    ni alla en tierras de Leon\r\n    sino quando era pequeño\r\n    que no sabio de amor.\r\n\r\nA piece, which is a companion to the above, commences thus:\r\n\r\n    Frontefrida, Frontefrida,\r\n    Frontefrida, y con amor,\r\n    Do todas las avecicas\r\n    Van tomar consolacion, &c.\r\n\r\nThe fiction on which this second song is founded must, notwithstanding\r\nits native beauty, appear a very absurd fancy to the naturalist, as it\r\ndescribes a nightingale wooing a turtle dove.\r\n\r\n[69] “Fizo _assaz buenas_ canciones,” says the Marquis of Santillana,\r\nin his antiquated Spanish, speaking of his grandfather. The remaining\r\nnotices which he gives of the origin of Spanish poetry communicate\r\nnothing, in addition to what has been already mentioned, on those\r\nthings respecting which it is most desirable to be informed.\r\n\r\n[70] See Velasquez, according to Dieze, page 302.\r\n\r\n[71] See Sarmiento, page 345.\r\n\r\n[72] See the observations of Sarmiento, page 352.\r\n\r\n[73] An extract made from this treatise of the Marquis of Villena by\r\nGregorio Mayans, may be found in the _Origines de la lengua Española_,\r\ntom. ii. pag. 321. The whole work probably exists in manuscript in\r\nSpanish libraries.\r\n\r\n[74] Tanto es el provecho, que viene desta dotrina a la vida civil,\r\nquitando ocio y ocupando los generosos ingenios en tan honesta\r\ninvestigacion, que las otras naciones desearon y procuraron haver\r\nentre si escuela desta dotrina, y por esso fue ampliada por el mundo\r\nen diversas partes.--The measure of this sonorous period will not be\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\n[75] Temporum iniquitate sublimi virtute superata, honorem vitæ ac\r\nbonum nomen fallacibus delinimentis omnibus, quæ magnam quamque\r\nfortunam velut pedissequi comitantur, præferebat, says, in allusion to\r\nhim, Nicolas Antonio, who at the same time refers to the Chronicles,\r\nfrom which he had drawn his information respecting the Marquis of\r\nSantillana.\r\n\r\n[76] This elegy is inserted along with other poems by the Marquis in\r\nall the editions of the _Cancionero general_, immediately after the\r\nspiritual poems. No complete collection of the works of this celebrated\r\nman has yet been printed.\r\n\r\n[77] That the Marquis had read Dante can scarcely be doubted, for he\r\nquotes him in this poem:--\r\n\r\n    Assi conseguimos de aquella manera,\r\n    Hasta que llegamos en somo del monte,\r\n    No menos cansados que Dante Acheronte.\r\n\r\n[78] Thus the two following stanzas are crowded with the names of\r\nauthors, ancient and modern, with the view of shewing the loss which\r\nSpanish literature had sustained by the death of Villena.\r\n\r\n        Perdimos a _Homero_ que mucho honorana\r\n    este sacro monte do nos habitamos\r\n    perdimos a _Ovidio_ el que coronamos\r\n    del arbol laureo que muchos amava\r\n    Perdimos _Horacio_ que nos invocava\r\n    en todos exordios de su poesia\r\n    assi disminuye la nuestra valia\r\n    que antiguos tiempos tanto prosperava.\r\n        Perdimos a _Livio_ y a Mantuano\r\n    _Macrobio_, _Valerio_, _Salustio_, _Magneo_\r\n    pues no olvidemos al moral _Agneo_\r\n    de quien se loava el pueblo Romano\r\n    Perdimos a _Julio_ y a _Casaliano_\r\n    _Alano_, _Boecio_, _Petrarcha_, _Fulgencio_\r\n    Perdimos a _Dante_, _Gaufre_, _Terencio_\r\n    _Juvenal_, _Estacio_, y _Quintiliano_.\r\n\r\n[79] Stanzas, like the following, deserve to be extracted from this\r\nwork, as they are calculated to shew what might have been expected of\r\nthe Marquis of Santillana, had he cultivated his talent for poetry\r\nunder more favourable circumstances.\r\n\r\n        Mas yo a ti sola me plaze llamar,\r\n    o cithara dulce, mas que la d’Orfeo;\r\n    que tu sola ayuda, no dudo, mas creo\r\n    mi rustica mano podra ministrar.\r\n    O Biblioteca de mortal cantar,\r\n    fuente meliflua de magna eloquencia,\r\n    infunde tu grande y sacra prudencia\r\n    en mi, porque yo pueda tu planto esplicar.\r\n        A tiempo a la hora suso memorado,\r\n    assi como niño que sacan de cuna,\r\n    no se falsamente, o si por fortuna,\r\n    me vi todo solo al pie de un collado,\r\n    Salvatico espesso lexano a poblado\r\n    agreste desierto y tan espantable,\r\n    que temo verguenza, no siendo culpable,\r\n    quando por extenso lo aure recontado.\r\n        No vi la carrera de gentes cursada,\r\n    ni rastro exercido por do me guiasse,\r\n    ni persona alguna a quien demandasse\r\n    consejo a mi cuyta tan desmesurada;\r\n    Mas sola una senda poco visitada\r\n    al medio de aquella tan gran espessura,\r\n    bien como adarmento subiente a l’altura\r\n    de rayo Dianeo me fue demostrada.\r\n\r\n[80] Don Alvaro de Luna begins to speak in the first stanzas:--\r\n\r\n        Vi tesoros ayuntados\r\n    por gran daño de su dueño.\r\n    Assi como sombra o sueño\r\n    son nuestros dias contados:--\r\n    Y si fueron prorogados\r\n    por sus lagrimas algunos\r\n    desto no vemos ningunos\r\n    por nuestros negros pecados.\r\n        Abrid abrid vuestros ojos,\r\n    gentios, mirad a mi,\r\n    quanto vistes, quanto vi,\r\n    fantasmas fueron y antojos.\r\n    Con trabajos con enojos\r\n    usurpe tal señoria,\r\n    que si fue no era mia\r\n    mas endevidos despojos.\r\n        Casa, casa, guay de mi!\r\n    campo a campo alleguè\r\n    casa agena no dexè,\r\n    tanto quise quanto vi.\r\n    Agora pues ved aqui,\r\n    quanto valen mis riquezas\r\n    tierras villas fortalezas\r\n    tras quien mi tiempo perdi.\r\n\r\n[81] There is a singular pedantry, with a happy turn of versification,\r\nin a song which commences thus:--\r\n\r\n        Antes el rodante cielo\r\n    tornara manso y quieto,\r\n    y sera piadoso _Aleto_,\r\n    y pavoroso _Metello_.\r\n    Que yo jamas olvidasse\r\n    tu virtud,\r\n    vida mia y mi salud,\r\n    ni te dexasse.\r\n        _Cesar_ afortunado\r\n    cessara de combatir,\r\n    y harian desdezir\r\n    al _Priamides_ armado--\r\n    Quando yo te dexarè,\r\n    ydola mia,\r\n    ni la tu philosomia\r\n    olvidarè; &c.\r\n\r\n[82] It commences thus:\r\n\r\n        Gozate, gozosa, madre,\r\n    gozo de la humanidad,\r\n    templo de la Trinidad,\r\n    elegida por dios padre,\r\n    Virgen que por el oydo\r\n    concebiste,\r\n    _gaude_, virgen, _mater Christi_,\r\n    y nuestro gozo infinido!\r\n        Gozate, luz reverida,\r\n    segun el Evangelista\r\n    por la madre del Baptista\r\n    anunciado la venida,\r\n    de nuestro gozo Señora\r\n    que trayas\r\n    vaso de nuestro mexias\r\n    gozate pulchra y decora, &c.\r\n\r\nIn this way the _Gozate_ is repeated through a series of stanzas.\r\n\r\n[83] Dieze, in his remarks on Velasquez, erroneously refers to the\r\npublication of Gregorio Mayans, for the proverbs in verse; but only\r\nthe original proverbs, without versification, (refranes que dicen las\r\nviejas tras el huego) as collected by the Marquis, are given in the\r\nsecond volume of that work, p. 179. The greater part deserve to be\r\nbetter known, but many of them are unintelligible to foreigners.\r\n\r\n[84] See the note, page 24.\r\n\r\n[85] E que cosa es la poesia, que _en nuestra vulgar_ (there is\r\nsomething equivocal here, for this term was not vernacular in the\r\nCastilian language) llamamos gaya sciencia, sino un fingimiento\r\nde cosas utiles, è veladas con muy fermosa cobertura, compuestas,\r\ndistinguidas, escondidas, por certo cuento, peso, è medida.\r\n\r\n[86] He appeals to St. Isidore, whom he cites as a guarantee for this\r\norigin of poetry:--Isidro Cartaginès, santo Arzobispo Hispalense, assi\r\nlo pruebra y testifica, e quiere, que el primero que fizo rythmos y\r\ncantó en metro hay sido Moysen, y despues Joshue, David, Salomon, y Job.\r\n\r\n[87] _Honestæ conditionis_, says Nicolas Antonio, speaking of his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n[88] Only the supplement to this poem is contained in the _Cancionero\r\ngeneral_. The poem itself was probably too long to be included in that\r\ncollection. However, in the editions of the collected works of Mena\r\n(for instance, that which I have now before me, intitled--_Todas las\r\nobras del famosissimo poeta Juan de Mena, &c._ Anveres, 1552, 8º)\r\nwhich Dieze notices, it fills the greater portion of the volume, and is\r\naccompanied by a copious commentary by Fernan Nuñez.\r\n\r\n[89] The emphatic praise bestowed on this poem in Dieze’s observations\r\non Velasquez, (page 168), according to which Juan de Mena “maintains\r\n_to his advantage_ a comparison with all the poets of all ages,” is\r\nsufficient to prove Dieze’s deficiency in sound criticism.\r\n\r\n[90] The second stanza contains the theme, but it is very imperfectly\r\nexpressed:--\r\n\r\n    Tus casos fallaces, Fortuna, cantamos\r\n    Estados de gentes que giras y trocas,\r\n    Tus muchas mudanzas, tus firmezas pocas,\r\n    Y las que en tu rueda quexosos hallamos.\r\n\r\n[91] Mena, politely enough, solicits permission of Fortune to read her\r\na lesson:\r\n\r\n    Dame licencia, mudable Fortuna,\r\n    Porque yo blasme de ti lo que devo.\r\n\r\nThen, in well turned antitheses, he allows her a sort of regularity\r\nwhich contradicts itself:--\r\n\r\n    Que tu firmeza es, no ser constante,\r\n    Tu temperamento es destemplanza,\r\n    Tu mas cierto orden es desordenanza, &c.\r\n\r\n[92] Providence appears as a most beautiful young woman:--\r\n\r\n    Una donzella tan mucho hermosa,\r\n    Que ante su gesto es loco quien osa\r\n    Otras beldades loar de mayores.\r\n\r\n[93] In the fourth stanza a patriotic flight seems to promise the\r\nrecurrence of similar passages:\r\n\r\n    Como que creo, que fossen menores,\r\n    Que los Africanos, los hechos del Cid?\r\n    Ni que feroces menos en la lid\r\n    Entrassen los nuestros que los Agenores? &c.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the author addresses an invocation to his native\r\ncity Cordova:\r\n\r\n    O flor de saber y cabelleria,\r\n    Cordova madre, tu hijo perdona,\r\n    Si en los cantares, que agora pregona,\r\n    No divulgarè tu sabiduria, &c.\r\n\r\n[94] From the following stanzas the degree of talent possessed by\r\nJuan de Mena for the poetical description of natural objects, without\r\nallegory, may be fairly estimated.\r\n\r\n        Bien como medico mucho famoso\r\n    Que trae el estilo por mano seguido\r\n    En cuerpo de golpes diversos herido\r\n    Luego socorre alo mas peligroso,\r\n    Assi aquel pueblo maldito sañoso\r\n    Sintiendo mas daño de parte del Conde\r\n    Con todas sus fuerças juntando responde\r\n    Alli do el peligro mas era dañoso.\r\n\r\n        Alli disparavan bombardas y truenos\r\n    Y los trabucos tiravan ya luego\r\n    Piedras y dardos y hachas de fuego\r\n    Con que los nuestros hazian ser menos.\r\n    de Moros tenidos por buenos\r\n    Lançan temblando las sus azagayas,\r\n    Passan las lindes palenques y rayas,\r\n    Doblan sus fuerças con miedos agenos.\r\n\r\n        Mientra morian y mientra matavan\r\n    De parte del agua ya crecen las ondas\r\n    Y cobran las mares sobervias y hondas\r\n    Los campos que ante los muros estavan,\r\n    Tanto que los que de alli peleavan\r\n    A los navios si se retrayan,\r\n    Las aguas crescidas les ya defendian\r\n    Tornar a las fustas que dentro dexavan.\r\n\r\n[95] When the poet, in his ideal world, sees Don Alvaro, by a singular\r\nfancy he pretends not to know him, in order that he may question his\r\nguide (Providence) respecting him, in imitation of a similar passage in\r\nHomer:--\r\n\r\n    Tu, Providencia, declara de nuevo,\r\n    Quien es aquel Caballero, que veo,\r\n    Que mucho en el cuerpo parece a Tydeo,\r\n    E en consejo a Nestor el longevo.\r\n\r\nAmong other things Providence replies:--\r\n\r\n    Este cavalga sobre la Fortuna\r\n    Y doma su cuello con asperas riendas,\r\n    Y aunque del tenga tan muchas deprendas,\r\n    Ella no le osa tocar de ninguna.\r\n    Miralo, miralo en platica alguna,\r\n    Con humildes, no tanto feroces!\r\n    Como, indiscreto, y tu no conoces\r\n    Al Condojos estable Alvaro de Luna?\r\n\r\n[96] For instance, the word _longevo_ in the verses quoted above.\r\n\r\n[97] The opening stanzas may be regarded as a poetic preface or\r\ndedication; but they gain nothing by that.\r\n\r\n    _Al muy prepotente_ Don Juan el Segundo,\r\n    Aquel, _con quien Jupiter tuvo tal zelo,\r\n    Que tanta de parte le haze del mundo,\r\n    Quanta a si misme se haze en el cielo_;\r\n    Al gran d’España, al _Cesar novelo_,\r\n    Al que es con fortuna bien afortunado\r\n    Aquel, con quien cabe virtud y reynado,\r\n    A el _las rodillas hincadas por suelo_.\r\n\r\n[98] This poem is not to be found in the _Cancionero general_, but\r\nit is included in the _Obras_, mentioned in the note, page 92. Juan\r\nde Mena gave it the absurd title of _Calamicleos_, compounded from\r\nthe latin _calamitas_ and the Greek κλεος. It was afterwards\r\ncalled, simply, _La Coronacion_.\r\n\r\n[99] Most of these questions were not very difficult to answer; for\r\ninstance, the following, which is preceded by three introductory\r\nstanzas in a very courtly style:--\r\n\r\n        Mostradme qual es aquel animal,\r\n    que luego se mueve en los quatro pies,\r\n    despues se sostiene en solos los tres,\r\n    despues en los dos va muy mas ygual.\r\n    Sin ser del especie quadrupedal\r\n    el curso que hizo despues reytera\r\n    assi que en los quatro d’aquesta manera\r\n    fenece el que nace de su natural.\r\n        Del hombre se halla ser gran enemigo,\r\n    porque lo hiere do nunca sospecha,\r\n    y donde mas plaze menos aprovecha\r\n    tanta ponçoña derrama consigo.\r\n    Dad vos Señor pues un tal castigo,\r\n    o de virtudes tal arma que vista,\r\n    porque alomenos punando resista\r\n    contra quien tiene tal guerra comigo.\r\n\r\n[100] The poem commences thus:--\r\n\r\n    Canta tu, Christiana musa,\r\n    _La mas que civil batalla_,\r\n    Que entre voluntad se halla\r\n    Y Razon, que nos accusa.\r\n\r\n[101] Nicolas Antonio, whom Dieze follows in his remarks on Velasquez,\r\nis the authority for these notices.\r\n\r\n[102] In the beginning of the sixteenth century, Spanish books were\r\nprinted in Seville by German printers. At the end of an edition,\r\nprobably the first, of the proverbs collected by the Marquis of\r\nSantillana, (see page 88,) are the following words, which Mayans y\r\nSiscar has reprinted:--Aqui se acaben los refranes--imprimidos en la\r\nmuy noble y leal civdad de Sevilla por Jacobo Comberger, Aleman, año\r\n1508.\r\n\r\n[103] On this subject Nicolas Antonio’s Bib. Hisp. vet. lib. x. cap. 6.\r\nmay be compared with Velasquez and Dieze, page 165.\r\n\r\n[104] To this number they amount in the old folio edition, printed with\r\ngothic characters, which forms one of the literary curiosities of the\r\nlibrary of Gottingen. Dieze, in his observations on Velasquez, page\r\n177, gives a particular account of this, as well as of the succeeding\r\neditions of the _Cancionero general_.\r\n\r\n[105] With this spiritual composition, the _Cancionero general_\r\ncommences. The reader will have enough in the first stanza:--\r\n\r\n    Enantes, que culpa fuesso cansada,\r\n    Tu, Virgen benigna, ya yves delante,\r\n    Tan lexos del crimen y del semejante,\r\n    Que sola quedaste daquel libertada, &c.\r\n\r\n[106] This silly conceit, which consists only of eight lines, commences\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n    La M madre te muestra,\r\n    La A te manda adorar, &c.\r\n\r\n[107] The _Ave_ begins thus:--\r\n\r\n    Ave, preciosa Maria,\r\n    Que se deve interpretar\r\n    Trasmontana de la mar,\r\n    Que los mareantes guia.\r\n\r\n[108] In the third strophe he thus addresses king Ferdinand:--\r\n\r\n    Gran señor, los, que creyeron\r\n    Estas consejeros tales,\r\n    De sus culmines reales\r\n    En lo mas hondo cayeron.\r\n    Si esto contradiran\r\n    Algunos con ambicion,\r\n    Testigos se les daran.\r\n    Uno sera _Roboan_,\r\n    Hijo del rey Solomon.\r\n\r\n[109] A new edition of Jorge Manrique’s Coplas, with glosses or poetic\r\nparaphrases by various authors, appeared at Madrid in 1779.\r\n\r\nThe following are the two first strophes, and the rhythmic structure of\r\nthe rest is not less beautiful.\r\n\r\n        Recuerde el alma dormida,\r\n    avive el seso y despierte\r\n    contemplando\r\n    come se pasa la vida,\r\n    come se viene la muerte\r\n    tan callando:\r\n    quan presto se va el placer,\r\n    como despues de acordado\r\n    da dolor,\r\n    como a nuestro parescer\r\n    qualquiera tiempo pasado\r\n    fue mejor.\r\n        Pues que vemos lo presente\r\n    quan en un punto se es ido\r\n    y acabado,\r\n    si juzgamos sabiamente,\r\n    daremos lo no venido\r\n    por pasado\r\n    No se engañe nadie, no,\r\n    pensando que ha de durar\r\n    lo que espera,\r\n    mas que duro lo que viò\r\n    pues que todo ha de pasar\r\n    por tal manera.\r\n\r\n[110] For instance, the following passage from a song by Juan de Mena:--\r\n\r\n    Ya _dolor_ del _dolorido_,\r\n    Que con _olvido_ cuydado,\r\n    Pues que antes _olvidado_\r\n    Me veo, que _fallecido_.\r\n    Ya _fallece_ mi sentido &c.\r\n\r\nOr:--\r\n\r\n    _Cuydar_ me hace _cuydado_\r\n    Lo que _cuydar_ no devria,\r\n    Y _cuydando_ en lo passado\r\n    Por mi no passa alegria.\r\n\r\nSuch plays of words are to be found throughout the whole _Cancionero_.\r\n\r\n[111] The commencement of one of his songs, the two first strophes of\r\nwhich are subjoined, is exceedingly beautiful; but in the sequel the\r\nlyric spark is extinguished by pedantry.\r\n\r\n        Muy mas clara que la luna\r\n    sola una\r\n    en el mundo vos nacistes,\r\n    tan gentil, que no vecistes\r\n    ni tuvistes\r\n    competidora ninguna,\r\n    Desde niñez en la cuna\r\n    cobrastes fama, beldad,\r\n    con tanta graciosidad,\r\n    que vos doto la fortuna.\r\n        Que assi vos organizo\r\n    y formò\r\n    la composicion humana,\r\n    que vos soys la mas loçana,\r\n    soberana\r\n    que la natura criò.\r\n    Quien sino vos mereciò\r\n    de virtudes ser monarcha?\r\n    Quanto bien dixo Petrarcha,\r\n    por vos lo profetizo.\r\n\r\nIt would be absurd to attempt the translation of many of the specimens\r\nwhich are necessary to the illustration of this work; and with respect\r\nto these lines the tender breathing of the poetry would be entirely\r\nlost in a literal version.\r\n\r\n[112] Reason, like a talkative person, commences the dialogue, and has\r\nalso the last word; she thus addresses her opponent:--\r\n\r\n        Pensamiento, pues mostrays\r\n    en vos misma claro el daño,\r\n    pregunt’os, que me digays\r\n    camino de tanto engaño,\r\n    do venis o donde vays\r\n    a tierra, que desconoce\r\n    muy presto la gente della\r\n    donde nace una querella,\r\n    y quien bien no le conoce\r\n    vive en ella.\r\n        Porque en ella ay una suerte,\r\n    d’una engañosa esparança\r\n    que el plazer nos da muerte,\r\n    por do el fin de su holgura\r\n    en trabajo se convierte.\r\n    Do sus glorias alcançadas,\r\n    puesto ya que sean seguras,\r\n    o con quantas amarguras\r\n    hallaras que son mezcladas\r\n    sus dulçuras!\r\n\r\n[113] He is particularly successful in expressing with old Spanish\r\nplainness the emotions of passion; as for instance in the following\r\nconcluding strophes of a farewell song.\r\n\r\n        De vos me parto, quexando,\r\n    y de mi, muy descontento\r\n    de mi triste pensamiento.\r\n    Mi vivir lo va llorando\r\n    vuestro mal conocimiento.\r\n    Assi que por sola vos\r\n    yo de todos vo enemigo,\r\n    pues me parto, como digo,\r\n    mal con vos y mal con Dios,\r\n    y mal comigo.\r\n        Aunque desto en la verdad\r\n    poca culpa tengo yo,\r\n    que mi fé no se mudò,\r\n    vuesta mala voluntad\r\n    m’a traido en lo qu’ estò.\r\n    Por do mis cuytas agora\r\n    vuestras seran desde aqui,\r\n    pues por vos a vos perdi,\r\n    y por vos a Dios, señora,\r\n    y mas a mi.\r\n\r\n[114] What a picturesque storm of passion appears under the antiquated\r\ngarb of the following stanzas! and with what a fantastic play of words\r\nare they interspersed!\r\n\r\n        La fuerça del fuego, que alumbra, que ciega\r\n    mi cuerpo, mi alma, mi muerte, mi vida,\r\n    do entrado hiere, do toca, do llega,\r\n    mata y no muere su llama encendida.\r\n    Pues que harè, triste, que todo me ofende?\r\n    Lo bueno y lo malo me causan congoxa,\r\n    quemandome el fuego que mata, qu’ enciende,\r\n    su fuerça que fuerça que ata, que prende,\r\n    que prende, que suelta, que tira, que afloxa.\r\n        Aso yre triste, que alegre me halle\r\n    pues tantos peligros me tienen en medio,\r\n    que llore, que ria, que grite, que calle,\r\n    ni tengo, ni quiero, ni espero remedio?\r\n    _Ni quiero que quiera, ni quiero querer_,\r\n    pues tanto me quiere tan raviosa plaga,\r\n    ni ser yo vencido, ni quiero vencer,\r\n    ni quiero pesar, ni quiero plazer,\r\n    ni se que me diga, ni se que me haga.\r\n\r\n[115] The following are the first and second strophes of this song.\r\nLove is here a hell, in which the thoughts burn.\r\n\r\n        Que tu beldad fue querer!\r\n    Mas a ti que a mi me quiero.\r\n    Tu beldad fue mensagero\r\n    de morir en tu poder.\r\n    Tu nubloso disfavor\r\n    me cerco sin fin eterno\r\n    d’unos fuegos qu’es amor\r\n    cuyo nombre es el infierno.\r\n        Qu’en su encendida casa\r\n    se queman mis pensamientos,\r\n    alli montan los tormentos\r\n    mis entrañas hazen brasa.\r\n    Alli sospiro los dias,\r\n    que morir no puede luego\r\n    alli las lagrimas mias\r\n    fortalezen mas en fuego.\r\n\r\n[116] This curious composition begins like a testamentary arrangement,\r\nand then immediately takes a poetic turn:--\r\n\r\n        Pues Amor quiere que muera,\r\n    y de tan penada muerte,\r\n    en tal edad,\r\n    pues que yo en tiempo tan fuerte,\r\n    quiero ordenar mi postrera\r\n    voluntad.\r\n    Pero ya que tal me siento,\r\n    que no lo podre hazer,\r\n    la que causa mi tormento\r\n    pues que tiene mi poder\r\n    ordene mi testamento.\r\n        Y pues mi ventura quiso\r\n    mis pensamientos tornar\r\n    ciegos, vanos,\r\n    no quiero otro paraiso,\r\n    _sino mi alma dexar\r\n    en sus manos_.\r\n    Pero que lleve de claro\r\n    la misma forma y tenor,\r\n    d’aquel que hizo d’amor\r\n    don Diego Lopez de Haro,\r\n    pues que yo muero amador.\r\n\r\n[117] The following is by a poet named Tapia.\r\n\r\n        Gran congoxa es esperar,\r\n    quando tarda el esperança,\r\n    mas quien tiene confiança\r\n    por tardar,\r\n    no deve desesperar.\r\n        Assi que vos, pensamiento,\r\n    que passays pena esperando,\r\n    galardon se va negando,\r\n    bien lo siento,\r\n    mas tened vos sufrimiento.\r\n    Y quiça podreys ganar\r\n    con firmeza sin dudança\r\n    lo cierto del esparança\r\n    que el tardar\r\n    no lo puede desviar.\r\n\r\n[118] The author of the following Villancico is named Escriva.\r\n\r\n        Que sentis, coraçon mio,\r\n    no dezis,\r\n    que mal es el que sentis.\r\n        Que sentistes aquel dia,\r\n    quando mi señora vistes,\r\n    que perdistes alegria,\r\n    y descando despedistes,\r\n    como a mi nunca bolvistes.\r\n    no dezis,\r\n    donde estays que no venis.\r\n        Qu’ es de vos, qu’ en mi nos fallo,\r\n    coraçon, quien os agena?\r\n    Qu’ es de vos, que aunque callo,\r\n    vuestro mal tambien me pena?\r\n    Quien os atò tal cadena.\r\n    no dezis,\r\n    que mal es el que sentis.\r\n\r\n[119] These glosses, which certainly belong to the fifteenth century,\r\nprove the still higher antiquity of the glossed romances. As a proof of\r\nthis, we may quote the commencement of a gloss of the _Rosa fresca_,\r\n(see p. 74), though it is not one of the most successful productions of\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\nLA GLOSA DE PINAR.\r\n\r\n      Quando y os quise querida,\r\n    si supiera conoceros,\r\n    n’os tuviera yo perdida\r\n    ni acuciara yo la vida\r\n    agora para quereros.\r\n    Y porqu’ es bien que padezca\r\n    desta causa mi dolor,\r\n    llam’os yo sin qu’ os merezca,\r\n    _Rosa fresca, rosa fresca,\r\n    tan garrida y con amor_.\r\n        Llam’os yo con voz plañida,\r\n    llena de gran compassion,\r\n    con el alma entristecida\r\n    del angustia dolorida,\r\n    que ha sufrido el coraçon.\r\n    Que le haze mil pedaços,\r\n    yo muero do quier que vò\r\n    pues que por mis embaraços.\r\n    _Quando y’os tuve en mis braços\r\n    no vos supe servir, no._\r\n        No porque os uviesse errado,\r\n    con pensamiento de errar,\r\n    mas si me days por culpado,\r\n    pues publico mi pecado\r\n    deveys me de perdonar.\r\n    No porque quando os servia\r\n    mi querer os desirvio,\r\n    mas porque passo solia,\r\n    _Y agora que os serviria,\r\n    no vos puedo yo aver, no_.\r\n\r\n[120] The device of an enamoured knight in the true Spanish style:\r\nWITHOUT THEE I AM WITHOUT GOD, AND WITHOUT MYSELF, was thus\r\nglossed.\r\n\r\n_Mote._\r\n\r\nSin vos, y sin Dios y mi.\r\n\r\nGLOSA DE DON JORGE MANRIQUE.\r\n\r\n        Yo soy quien libre me vi,\r\n    yo quien pudiera olvidaros,\r\n    yo so el que por amaros\r\n    estoy desque os conoci\r\n    _sin Dios y sin vos y mi_.\r\n        _Sin Dios_, porque en vos adoro\r\n    _sin vos_, pues no me quereys,\r\n    pues _sin mi_ ya esto decoro,\r\n    que vos soys quien me teneys.\r\n    Assi que triste naci,\r\n    pues que pudiera olvidaros,\r\n    yo soy el que por amaros\r\n    esto desque os conoci\r\n    _sin Dios y sin vos y mi_.\r\n\r\n[121] An accurate idea of all the romances of this class may be\r\nderived from the _Historia de los Vandos de los Zegris y Abencerrages,\r\nCaballeros Moros de Granada_, a work well known to those who are\r\nacquainted with Spanish literature. It has been several times printed.\r\nThe edition which I have now before me (Lisboa 1616,) seems to be one\r\nof the latest. On the title page the author styles himself, Ginez Perez\r\nde Hita, and on that page also appear the words, _Aora nuevamente\r\nsacado de un libro Arabigo_. The German critic Blankenburgh, is of\r\nopinion, that there is no more reason for supposing this work to be a\r\ntranslation from the Arabic, than that Don Quixote was derived from a\r\nsimilar source. But the word _sacado_ on the title page, by no means\r\nindicates that it is a translation. The author has evidently derived\r\nmuch of his information, such for instance, as the genealogical\r\nregister of the families, from Moorish sources. He has probably availed\r\nhimself of an Arabic work to write a half true and half fabulous\r\nhistory of Granada, and to intersperse it with favourite romances.\r\nThere is a counterfeit edition of this work, entitled, _Historia de las\r\nguerras civiles de Granada, Paris_, 1660. From the French words on the\r\nmargin, it is obvious that the book must have been used in Paris in the\r\nseventeenth century, for learning the Spanish language.\r\n\r\n[122] It will be sufficient to transcribe here one of these pastoral\r\nromances, which presents a fair specimen of the better part of the rest.\r\n\r\n        Olvidada del sucesso,\r\n    del engañado Narciso,\r\n    mirando està en una fuente\r\n    Filis su rostro divino,\r\n    el negro cabello suelto,\r\n    al ayre vano esparzido,\r\n    ceñida la blanca frente\r\n    con un liston amarillo.\r\n        Mira los hermosos ojos,\r\n    y el labio en sangre teñido\r\n    de los cristalinos dientes\r\n    adornado y ofendido:\r\n    no se mira el bello rostro,\r\n    por presuncion que ha tenido,\r\n    mas porque le mueve a ello\r\n    el desprecio de su amigo.\r\n        Hala dexado el cruel,\r\n    sin averlo merecido,\r\n    por quien vale menos que ella,\r\n    y es della menos querido.\r\n    Pareciole que enturbiava\r\n    con las perlas que ha vertido\r\n    las corrientes amorosas,\r\n    y solloçando, les dixo:\r\n        Turbias van las aguas madre,\r\n        turbias van,\r\n        mas ellas se aclararàn.\r\n      Si el agua de mi alegria\r\n    enturbia la de mis ojos,\r\n    y le ofrecen mis despojos\r\n    al alma en mi fantasia,\r\n    sospechas son, que algun dia\r\n    tiempo y amor desharan.\r\n        Turbias van las aguas madre,\r\n        turbias van,\r\n        mas ellas se aclararàn.\r\n      Si fatiga el pensamiento,\r\n    y se enturbia la memoria,\r\n    juntar la passada gloria\r\n    con el presente tormento,\r\n    si esparzidos por el viento\r\n    mis tristes suspiros van.\r\n        Turbias van las aguas madre\r\n        turbias van,\r\n        mas ellas se aclararàn.\r\n\r\n[123] The following is written in a style which was, at a later period,\r\nmuch admired in France, and frequently imitated in Germany while\r\nHagedorn and Gleim flourished:--\r\n\r\n    Que se case un don Pelote\r\n        con una dama sin dote,\r\n            Bien puede ser.\r\n    Mas que no de algunos dias\r\n        por un pan sus damerias,\r\n            No puede ser.\r\n    Que pida a un galan Minguilla\r\n        cinco puntos de servilla.\r\n            Bien puede ser.\r\n    Mas que calçando diez Menga,\r\n        quiera que justo la venga,\r\n            No puede ser.\r\n    Que la biuda en el sermon\r\n        de mil suspiros sin son,\r\n            Bien puede ser.\r\n    Mas que no los de a mi cuenta,\r\n        porque sepan do se assienta,\r\n            No puede ser.\r\n    Que ande la bella casada\r\n        bien vestida, y mal zelada,\r\n            Bien puede ser.\r\n    Mas que el bueno del marido\r\n        no sepa quien da el vestido,\r\n            No puede ser. &c.\r\n\r\n[124] See the notices of Nicolas Antonio, Sarmiento, Velasquez, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[125] It is entitled _Romancero general_, en que se contienen todos los\r\nromances, que andan impresos, aora _nuevamente añadido y enmendado_,\r\nMadrid, 1604, a quarto volume, containing about seventy sheets. The\r\npreface is subscribed by the bookseller, who seems to have compiled\r\nthis work himself. The _todos_ on the title page must not be literally\r\nunderstood. Not one of the romances contained in the old _Cancionero de\r\nRomances_, (see note page 53) appear in this _Romancero general_, which\r\nis, in other respects, extremely copious. But the Spanish booksellers\r\nbegan at an early period to give boasting titles to their publications.\r\n\r\n[126] More copious information, together with bibliographic notices\r\nrespecting the pastoral dialogue of Mingo Rebulgo, are given by\r\nVelasquez and Dieze, page 162.\r\n\r\n[127] Sarmiento, page 235, quotes this specimen of Juan de la Enzina’s\r\n_Disparates_:--\r\n\r\n        Anoche do madrugada,\r\n    Ya despues de medio dia,\r\n    Vi venir en romeria\r\n    Una nube muy cargada &c.\r\n    No despues de mucho rato\r\n    Vi venir un orinal\r\n    Puesto de pontifical &c.\r\n\r\n[128] Nicolas Antonio, Sarmiento, and Velasquez, give accounts of Juan\r\nde la Enzina. Some of his romances and songs, which however, possess\r\nno remarkable merit, are also contained in the _Cancionero general_\r\nand the _Cancionero de romances_. One of his compositions, styled an\r\n_echo_, or a song, in which the rhyme is repeated in the following\r\nword, with the effect of an echo, is inserted in the _Cancionero\r\ngeneral_, as being something peculiar. The old collection, entitled,\r\n_Cancionero de todas las obras de Juan del Enzina_, certainly contains\r\npoems far superior to any already mentioned, though perhaps they do not\r\nrise above the poetry of his age. Velasquez quotes an edition published\r\nin 1516, which Dieze regards as a curiosity. Indeed one of the greatest\r\nliterary curiosities in existence, is an old folio edition, (probably\r\nthe first) of the _Cancionero_ of Juan de la Enzina, printed at\r\nSeville, in gothic characters, in the year 1501, by two Germans named\r\nPegnitzer and Herbst, at the expense of two merchants. The copy to\r\nwhich I have referred, which is probably the only one in Germany, is\r\nalso mentioned in Dieze’s supplement to Velasquez; it belongs to the\r\nDucal library at Wolfenbüttel. Notwithstanding the gothic characters,\r\nthe print is so clear and neat, that in this respect alone it is highly\r\ninteresting to bibliographists. Juan de la Enzina’s songs occupy the\r\ngreater part of the volume. One of them, namely--an Apology for Women,\r\n(_Contra los que dicen mal de Mugeres_) is remarkable for poetic truth\r\nand pleasing versification. In this Apology for the fair sex, the\r\nauthor, among other things, says:\r\n\r\n    Piadosas en dolerse\r\n    De todo ageno dolor,\r\n    Con muy sana fe y amor,\r\n    Sin su fama escurecerse,\r\n    Ellas nos hacen hacer\r\n    De nuestros bienes franquezas;\r\n    Ellas nos hacen poner\r\n    A procurar y querer\r\n    Las virtudes y noblezas.\r\n    Ellas nos dan ocasion,\r\n    Que nos hagomas discretos,\r\n    Esmerados y perfetos,\r\n    Y de mucho presuncion.\r\n    Ellas nos hacen andar\r\n    Las vestiduras polidas,\r\n    Los pundonores guardar,\r\n    Y, por honra procurar,\r\n    Tener en poco las vidas.\r\n\r\nHis imitations of Virgil’s eclogues have the same metrical form as many\r\nof his other poems. The first eclogue commences with the following\r\ngraceful strophe:--\r\n\r\n    Tityro, tu sin cuidado\r\n    Que te estas so aqueste haya,\r\n    Bien tendido y rellanado.\r\n    Yo triste y descarriado\r\n    Yo no sè, por do me vaya.\r\n    Ay, carillo!\r\n    Tañes tu tu caramillo,\r\n    No hay que en cordoja te trayga.\r\n\r\nHis sacred and profane pastoral dramas are merely eclogues in a style\r\nsimilar to the above, only that they are written in the dialogue form,\r\nand with remarkable lightness. The last, which is of the profane class,\r\ncommences thus:--\r\n\r\n    Gil.    Ha, Mingo, que das de atràs?\r\n            Pasa, pasa, acà delante!\r\n            A horas que no se espante,\r\n            Como tu, tu primo Bras.\r\n            Asmo, que tu pavor has.\r\n            Entra! No estes revellado!\r\n\r\n    Mingo.  Dò me a Dios, que estoy asmado.\r\n            No me mandes entrar mas.\r\n\r\n[129] In the edition of 1599, which I have consulted, the work is\r\nentitled _Celestina, tragicomedia de Calisto y Melibea_. The first\r\nletter of each of the introductory stanzas, being put together, form\r\nthe following words:--El bachiler Fernando de Rojas _acabò_ la comedia\r\nde Calisto y Melibea, e fue nacido en la puebla de Montalvan.\r\n\r\n[130] The following specimens may be cited. Callistus is discoursing\r\nwith his servant, concerning his passion for Melibœa.\r\n\r\n_Ca._ Mayor es mi fuego, y menor la piedad de quien agora digo.--_Sem._\r\nNo me engaño que loco està aste mi amo.--_Ca._ Que estàs murmurando\r\nSempronio?--_Sem._ No digo nada.--_Ca._ Di lo que dizes: no\r\ntemas.--_Sem._ Digo que como pueda ser mayor el fuego que atormenta un\r\nbivo, que el que quemó tal ciudad y tanta multitud de gente?--_Ca._\r\nComo? yo telo dire: mayor es la llama que dura ochenta años que la\r\nque en un dia passa; y mayor la que quema un anima, que la que quemó\r\ncien mil cuerpos. Como de la aparencia a la existencia, como de lo\r\nvivo a lo pintado; como de la sombra a lo real: tanta differencia ay\r\ndel fuego que dizes al que me quema. Por cierto si el del purgatorio\r\nes tal, mas querria que mi espiritu fuesse con los de los brutos\r\nanimales, que por medio de aquel yr a la gloria de los santos.--_Sem._\r\nAlgo es lo que digo, a mas ha de yr este hecho: no basta loco, sino\r\nhereje.--_Ca._ No te digo que hables alto quando hablares? Que\r\ndizes?--_Sem._ Digo que nunca Dios quiera tal: que es especie de\r\nherejia lo que agora dixiste.--_Ca._ Porque?--_Sem._ Porque lo que\r\ndizes contradize la Christiana religion.--_Ca._ Que a mi?--_Sem._ Tu\r\nno eres Christiano?--_Ca._ Yo Melibieo soy, e a Melibea adoro, e en\r\nMelibea creo, e a Melibea amo.\r\n\r\n[131] About the same period, the dramatic prose dialogue of Italy was\r\nformed in a similar style, but with more histrionic refinement. See\r\nvol. ii. of my history of Italian Literature.\r\n\r\n[132] The dramatic romance of Callistus and Melibœa, has been\r\ntranslated into several languages as a book of moral instruction.\r\nThere is an old German translation which appeared at Nurnberg in 1520,\r\nentitled the _Hurenspiegel_. The German philologist, Caspar Barth,\r\ntranslated it into Latin under the title of _Pornoboscodidascalus_, and\r\nstyles it, _Liber plane divinus_. It was published at Frankfort on the\r\nOder, in 1624.\r\n\r\n[133] One may become acquainted with these old Spanish chronicles\r\nwith more facility than formerly; for during the last thirty years\r\nthe greater part of them have been re-printed. A folio edition of the\r\ncopious chronicle of Peres de Guzman was printed at Valencia, in the\r\nyear 1779, with an elegance which proves the patriotic zeal of the\r\neditors: the chronicle of Ayala was printed at Madrid in the same year.\r\nLiterature is indebted for this revival of the fathers of Spanish\r\nHistory, to the efforts of the Historical Academy of Madrid.\r\n\r\n[134] It is not many years since this history was first published from\r\nthe manuscript. It is intitled, _Cronica de Don Pedro Niño Conde de\r\nBuelna, por Gutierre Diez de Games, su Aferes. La publica D. Eugenio de\r\nLlaguno Amirola_, &c. Madrid, 1782, in quarto.\r\n\r\n[135] He gives the following description of the national character of\r\nthe French, which derives additional attraction from its antiquated\r\nlanguage:--\r\n\r\nLos Franceses son noble nacion de gente: son sabios é muy entendidos,\r\né discretos en todas las cosas que pertenescen á buena crianza en\r\ncortesia é gentileza. Son muy gentiles en sus traeres, é guarnidos\r\nricamente: traense mucho á lo propio: son francos é dadivosos: aman\r\nfacer placer á todas las gentes: honran mucho los estrangeros: saben\r\nloar, é loan mucho los buenos fechos: non son maliciosos: dan pasada á\r\nlos enojos: non caloñan á ome de voz nin fecho, salvo si los vá alli\r\nmucho de sus honras: son muy corteses é graciosos en su fablar: son muy\r\nalegres, toman placer de buena mente, é buscanle. Asi ellos como ellas\r\nson muy enamorados, é precianso dello.\r\n\r\n[136] That this biographical chronicle was written between the years\r\n1453 and 1460, is proved in the preface to the latest edition, which\r\nis entitled, _Cronica de Don Alvaro de Luna, &c. La publica con varios\r\napendices Don Josef Miguel de Flores, Secretario perpetuo de la real\r\nAcademia de la Historia._ Madrid, 1784, 4to.\r\n\r\n[137] The following is one of his declamatory passages: it is certainly\r\nmore suited to a philippic than to a biographic work, but it is\r\nsufficiently oratorical for the age in which it was produced:--\r\n\r\nOh traycion! oh traycion! oh traycion! Maldito sea el ser tuyo:\r\nmaldito sea el poder tuyo: é maldito el tu obrar, que á tanto se\r\nestiende, é tantas fuerzas alcanza. Oh enemiga de toda bondad, é\r\nadversaria de toda virtud, é contraria de todos bienes! Por tì han\r\nseìdo destruidos Reynos: por tí han seìdo asoladas grandes é nobles, é\r\npopulosas cibdades: é por tì son cometidas en Emperadores, é Reyes, é\r\nPrincipes, é altos señores, crueles, bravas é miserables muertes. Quien\r\npudiera pensar? Quien pudiera creer? O qu’al juicio pudiera abastar á\r\nconsiderar, que un tanto señor, é de tan alto ser, un tan grand, á tan\r\nfamiliar amigo de virtudes, como era el inclito Maestre de Sanctiago é\r\ninsigne Condestable de la gran Castilla, viniesse al passo que agora\r\naqui contaremos?\r\n\r\n[138] Entre los otros frutos abundosos que la España en otro tiempo\r\nde sì solia dar, fallo yo que el mas precioso de aquellos fué criar\r\né nudrir en si varones muy virtuosos notables é dispuestos para\r\nenseñorear, sabios para regir, duros é fuertes para guerrear. De los\r\nquales unos fueron subidos á la cumbre imperial, otros á la relumbrante\r\ncatedra del saber. E muchos otros merescieron por victoria corona del\r\ntriunfo resplandesciente.\r\n\r\n[139] E tentando entrar la presente obra donde pues tú, Verdad, eres\r\nuna de las principales virtudes que en aqueste nuestro muy buen Maestre\r\nsiempre fecistes morada, á tí solo llamo é invoco que adiestres la mi\r\nmano, alumbres el mi ingenio, abundes la mi memoria, porque yo pueda\r\nconfirmar é sellar la comenzada obra con el tu precioso nombre.\r\n\r\n[140] The author thus relates how in his youth Don Alvaro de Luna, by\r\nthe irresistible grace of his manners had gained the love of the king,\r\nwho was then also very young, and the favour of the fair sex:--\r\n\r\nCa si Rey salia á danzar, non queria que otro caballero ninguno, nin\r\ngrande nin Rico ome danzase con él, salvo Don Alvaro de Luna, nin\r\nqueria con otro cantar, nin facer cosa, salvo con Don Alvaro, nin se\r\napartaba con otro á aver sus consejos é fablas secretas tanto como con\r\nél. De la otra parte que todas las dueñas é doncellas lo favorescian\r\nmucho. Don Alvaro era mas mirado é preciado entre todos aquellos que\r\nen las fiestas se ayuntaron. E despues quando el Rey se retraìa á\r\nsu cámara á burlar ó aver placer, Don Alvaro burlaba tan cortés é\r\ngraciosamente, que el Rey é todos los otros que con él eran avian muy\r\ngrand placer. E si fablaban en fechos de caballeria, aunque Don Alvaro\r\nera mozo, él fablaba en ellos, assi bien é atentamente que todos se\r\nmaravillaban. E aquel fué desde niño su mayor estudio, entender en los\r\nfechos de armas é de caballeria, é darse á ellos, é saber en ellos mas\r\nfacer que decir.\r\n\r\n[141] The library of the university of Göttingen contains a copy of\r\nthis scarce book, printed in gothic characters, but the title page\r\nis wanting. It commences with the title of the table of contents:\r\n_Comiença la tabla de los claros varones, ordenada por Fernando del\r\nPulgar, &c._ The biographical sketches are followed by a collection\r\nof letters; and the whole forms a volume with which every author who\r\nwrites on Spanish history ought to be acquainted.\r\n\r\n[142] The following specimen is the commencement of a jocular letter,\r\nin which Fernando del Pulgar begs of his physician to prescribe to him\r\na remedy for the sciatica, as the consolation which Cicero offers in\r\nhis book _de Senectute_ had no effect on him:--\r\n\r\nSeñor dotor Francisco Nuñes fisico: yo Fernando de Pulgar escrivano\r\nparesco ante vos: y digo que padesciendo grand dolor de la yjada: y\r\notros males que asoman con la vejez quise leer a Julio de senetute\r\npara aver del para ellos algun remedio. Y no le de dios mas salud al\r\nalma de lo que yo falle en el para mi yjada. Verdad es que da muchas\r\nconsolaciones: y cuenta muchos loores de la vejez. Pero no provee de\r\nremedio para sus males. Quisiere yo fallar un remedio solo, mas por\r\ncierto de Señor fisico que todos sus consolaciones por que el conorte\r\nquando no quita dolor, no pone consolacion. Quise ver essomismo el\r\nsegundo libro que fizo de las quistiones Tosculanas. Do quiere provar\r\nque el sabio no deve haver dolor: y si lo hoviere lo puede desechar con\r\nvirtud. E yo Señor dotor como no soy sabio senti el dolor. Y como no\r\nsoy virtuoso no le puede desechar. Ni lo desechara el mismo Julio por\r\nvirtuoso que fuera: si sintiera el mal que yo sinti. Assi que para las\r\nenfermedades que vienen con la vejez fallo que es mejor yr al fisico\r\nremediador: que al filosofo consolador. Por los Cipiones, por los\r\nMetellos, y sabios, y por los Trasos, y por otros algunos romanos que\r\nbivieron y murieron en honra quiere provar Julio que la vejez es buena.\r\nY por algunos que ovieron mala postremera provare yo que es mala. E\r\ndare mayor numero de testigos para prueva de mi intencion que el Señor\r\nJulio pudo dar para en prueva de la suya.\r\n\r\n[143] See the notice by Nicolas Antonio in the _Bibl. Hisp. Vetus_,\r\nlast edition, (Madrid, 1788,) vol. ii. p. 282.\r\n\r\n[144] This treatise precedes the collection of Juan de la Enzina’s\r\npoems. See note page 131.\r\n\r\n[145] Criados en el gremio de la dulce filosofia. This he says in\r\nparticular reference to Ferdinand and Isabella.\r\n\r\n[146] Quanta diferencia aya del Musico al Cantor, y del Geometra al\r\nPedrero, tanta debe haver entre Poeta é Trobador. The third comparison\r\nfollows afterwards.\r\n\r\n[147] An unpardonable neglect of chronology has given rise to a\r\nconfusion of dates, by which this period of Spanish literature has been\r\nmade to include two distinct epochs. This confusion is particularly\r\nstriking in the work of Velasquez. In his third age of Castilian\r\npoetry, which he commences with the introduction of the Italian style,\r\nbut which ought really to be called the second, he reckons all the\r\nSpanish poets, who appear to have formed their manner after Italian\r\nmodels down to the reign of Philip IV.; and in the following age, which\r\nhe calls the fourth, he places Virnes, Lope de Vega, and others, who\r\nflourished half a century before.\r\n\r\n[148] See page 25. In the _Cancionero general_ there are some spiritual\r\nsonnets, but they are all equally aukward and repulsive.\r\n\r\n[149] The history of the opposition which Boscan’s poetical reform\r\nexperienced, is briefly related by himself in the dedication to the\r\nDuchess of Soma, which precedes the second volume of his poems.\r\n\r\n[150] The eighth volume of the _Parnaso Español_, by Sedano, contains a\r\nsupplement to the biographical notices which Nicolas Antonio collected\r\nunder the article Boscan, and Dieze adopted in his notes on Velasquez.\r\nThe _Noticias Biographicas_, which Sedano has added to the _Parnaso\r\nEspañol_, deserve, from this epoch downward, to be carefully consulted.\r\n\r\n[151] The library of the university of Göttingen possesses a copy of\r\nperhaps the oldest edition of the works of this author, viz. _Obras de\r\nBoscan_, _Lisboa_ 1543, in 4to., and another edition, _Anvers_ 1569, in\r\n8vo.\r\n\r\n[152] The first strophe runs thus:--\r\n\r\n    El _sentir de mi sentido_\r\n    Tan profundo ha navegado,\r\n    Que me tiene ya engolfado,\r\n    Donde vivo despedido\r\n    De salir ni a pie ni a nado; &c.\r\n\r\n[153] The spirit of Petrarch breathes in the following sonnet; though\r\nit is accompanied in the latter verses with a portion of romantic\r\nsubtilty.\r\n\r\n        Solo y pensoso en prados y desiertos\r\n    mis passos doy cuydosos y cansados:\r\n    y entrambos ojos traygo levantados\r\n    à ver no vea alguien mis desconciertos.\r\n        Mis tormentos alli vienen tan ciertos,\r\n    y van mis sentimentos tan cargados,\r\n    que aun los campos me suelen ser passados,\r\n    porque todos no estan secos y muertos.\r\n        Si oyo hablar à caso algun ganado,\r\n    y la voz d’ el pastor da en mis oydos,\r\n    alli se me rebuelve mi cuydado.\r\n        Y quedan espantados mis sentidos,\r\n    como ha sido no aver desesperado,\r\n    despues de tantos llantos doloridos.\r\n\r\n[154] Passages such as the following from the beautiful _Claros y\r\nfrescos rios_ of Boscan, after Petrarch’s canzone _Chiare, dolci e\r\nfresche acque_, would be sought for in vain in the writings of Petrarch\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n    Las horas estoy viendo\r\n        en ella y los momentos,\r\n        y cada cosa pongo en su sazon.\r\n        Comigo aca la entiendo,\r\n        pienso sus pensamientos,\r\n        por mi saco los suyos quales son:\r\n        dize m’ el coraçon,\r\n        y pienso yo que acierta,\r\n        ya esta alegre, ya triste,\r\n        ya sale, ya se viste,\r\n        agora duerme, agora esta despierta:\r\n        el seso y el amor,\r\n        andan por quien la pintara mejor.\r\n    Viene me à la memoria\r\n        donde la vi primero,\r\n        y aquel lugar do comencè de amalla,\r\n        y naceme tal gloria\r\n        de ver como la quiero,\r\n        que es ya mejor qu’ el vella el contemplalla.\r\n        En el contemplar halla\r\n        mi alma un gozo estraño,\r\n        pienso estalla mirando,\r\n        despues en mi tornando,\r\n        pesame que dura poco el engaño:\r\n        no pido otra alegria,\r\n        sino engañar mi triste fantasia.\r\n\r\n[155] The following passage may serve for an example:--\r\n\r\n    No oso pensar el dia y hora quando\r\n        mis ojos començaron a mirarte,\r\n        su vista poco a poco desmandando:\r\n    Entonces comencè a considerarte,\r\n        con pensamientos que y van y venian,\r\n        y casi no era mas de imaginarte.\r\n    Los unos blandamente me dezian,\r\n        que con mi coraçon todo te amasse,\r\n        los otros se alterava y temian.\r\n    Fuerça fue en fin, que poco a poco entrasse\r\n        a conocer mi triste entendimiento,\r\n        que era bien que tus cosas contemplasse.\r\n    Alli se levantò mi pensamiento\r\n        haziendo su discurso en mil ojetos,\r\n        y todos sobre un mismo fundamento.\r\n\r\n[156] A certain horatian epicurean spirit is recognizable in the view\r\nhe takes of the philosophy of life.\r\n\r\n    En tierra do los vicios van tan llenos,\r\n        aquellos hombres que no son peores,\r\n        aquellos passaran luego por buenos.\r\n    Yo no ando ya siguiendo à los mejores,\r\n        bastame alguna vez dar fruto alguno,\r\n        en lo de mas contentome de flores.\r\n    No quiero en la virtud ser importuno,\r\n        ni pretendo rigor en mis costumbres,\r\n        con el gloton no pienso estar ayuno.\r\n    La tierra està con llanos y con cumbres,\r\n        lo tolerable al tiempo acomodemos,\r\n        y à su sazon hagamonos dos lumbres.\r\n\r\nPictures of domestic happiness, partaking both of the manner of Horace\r\nand Tibullus, form an agreeable addition to Boscan’s moral reflections,\r\nviz.\r\n\r\n    Comigo y mi muger sabrosamente\r\n        estè, y alguna vez me pida celos,\r\n        con tal que me los pida blandamente.\r\n    Comamos y bevamos sin recelos,\r\n        la mesa de muchachos rodeada;\r\n        mochachos que nos hagan ser aguelos.\r\n    Passeremos assi neustra jornada,\r\n        agora en la ciudad ahora en la aldea,\r\n        porque la vida estè mas descansada.\r\n    Quando pesada la ciudad nos sea,\r\n        yremos al lugar con la compaña,\r\n        adonde el importuno no nos vea.\r\n    Alli se vivira con menos maña,\r\n        y no aura el hombre tanto de guardarse\r\n        d’ el malo, o d’ el grossero que os engaña.\r\n    Alli podra mejor philosopharse\r\n        con los bueyes, y cabras, y ovejas,\r\n        que con los que d’ el vulgo han de tratarse.\r\n\r\n[157] The description of Venus appearing, when the star which has\r\nobtained her name rises, is thus given:--\r\n\r\n    Mostrava ya su resplandor la estrella,\r\n        Que barre de la sombra neustra suelo,\r\n        Y al su venir toda otra cosa bella\r\n        Dexava su lugar alla en el cielo:\r\n        Quando Venus salio, y al salir d’ ella\r\n        Saliò el amor, y junto saliò el zelo,\r\n        El zelo que de amor nace en las cosas,\r\n        Y mas en las que nacen mas hermosas.\r\n    Saliò con sus cabellos esprazidos,\r\n        Esta reyna de amor y de hermosura,\r\n        Su rostro blanco y blancos sus vestidos,\r\n        Con gravedad mezclada con dulçura:\r\n        Los ojos entre vivos y caidos,\r\n        Divino el ademan y la figura,\r\n        Como aquella que Zeuxis trasladó\r\n        De las cinco donzellas de Crotò.\r\n\r\n[158] Some stanzas in the speech which the missionary Cupids address\r\nto the ladies of Barcelona, bring to recollection a passage in Tasso’s\r\nJerusalem, though that poem did not then exist.\r\n\r\n    N’ os engañe ni os trayga levantadas,\r\n        La mocedad y verde loçania:\r\n        Que os hallareys despues peor burladas,\r\n        Con el tiempo que burla cada dia.\r\n        Y de suerte os vereys desengañadas,\r\n        Que engañaros querra la fantasia,\r\n        Y n’ os valdra ni maña ni consejo,\r\n        Ni miraros mil vezes al espejo.\r\n    Guardad que mientras el buen tiempo dura,\r\n        No se os pierda la fresca primavera:\r\n        Sali à gozar el campo y su verdura,\r\n        Antes que todo en el invierno muera:\r\n        Reposa y sossega en essa frescura,\r\n        Con el ayre que blandamente os hierra,\r\n        Y assi falsas podreys estar señoras,\r\n        Sobre el correr d’el tiempo y de las horas.\r\n\r\n[159]\r\n\r\n    Danubio, rio divino\r\n    Que por fieras naciones\r\n    Vas con tus claras ondas discurriendo, &c.\r\n\r\n[160] In his elegy on Boscan he thus apostrophizes Mars:--\r\n\r\n    O crudo, o riguroso, o duro Marte,\r\n    De tunica cubierto de diamante,\r\n    _Y endurecido siempre en toda parte, &c._\r\n\r\n[161] The edition of the _Obras de Garcilaso de la Vega_, Madrid, 1765,\r\n8vo. published by an anonymous editor, contains impartial and correct\r\nremarks on the beauties and the defects of the author’s poetry. The\r\npreface which is written with a spirit of patriotic frankness is also\r\nworthy of perusal.\r\n\r\n[162] In the following sonnet the dull and affected close forms a\r\ndisagreeable contrast to the fine commencement.\r\n\r\n    La mar en medio y tierras he dexado\r\n        De quanto bien, cuitado, yo tenía:\r\n        Y yéndome alejando cada dia,\r\n        Gentes, costumbres, lenguas he pasado.\r\n    Ya de volver estoy desconfiado;\r\n        Pienso remedios en mi fantasía:\r\n        Y el que mas cierto espero, es aquel dia\r\n        Que acabará la vida y el cuidado.\r\n    Do qualquier mal pudiera socorrerme\r\n        Con veros yo, señora, ó esperallo,\r\n        Si esperallo pudiera sin perdello.\r\n    Mas de no veros ya para valerme,\r\n        Sino es morir, ningun remedio hallo:\r\n        Y si este lo es, tampoco podré habello.\r\n\r\n[163] It is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    O dulces prendas, por mi mal halladas,\r\n        Dulces y alegres, quando Dios queria!\r\n        Juntas estays en la memoria mia,\r\n        Y con ella en mi muerte conjuradas.\r\n    Quien me dixera, quando las passadas\r\n        Horas en tanto bien por vos me via,\r\n        Que me haviais de ser el algun dia\r\n        Con tan grave dolor representadas!\r\n    Pues en un hora junto me llevastes,\r\n        Todo el bien, que por terminos me distes,\r\n        Llevadme junto el mal, que me dexastes.\r\n    Si no, sospecharè, que me pusistes\r\n        En tantos bienes, porque deseastes\r\n        Verme morìr entre memorias tristes.\r\n\r\nWhen stripped, however, of the pleasing versification, the ideas in the\r\nlast lines appear somewhat studied and far-fetched.\r\n\r\n[164] The following two strophes are from the lament of Salicio.\r\n\r\n    Por ti el silencio de la selva umbrosa,\r\n        Por ti la esquividad y apartamiento\r\n        Del solitario monte me agradaba:\r\n        Por ti la verde hierba, el fresco viento,\r\n        El blanco lirio y colorada rosa,\r\n        Y dulce primavera deseaba.\r\n        Ay! quanto me engañaba,\r\n        Ay! quan diferente era,\r\n        Y quan de otra manera\r\n        Lo que en tu falso pecho se escondía!\r\n        Bien claro con su voz me lo decía\r\n        La siniestra corneja repitiendo\r\n        La desventura mia.\r\n        Salid sin duelo lágrimas corriendo.\r\n    Quantas veces durmiendo en la floresta\r\n        (Reputándolo yo por desvarío)\r\n        Vi mi mal entre sueños, desdichado!\r\n        Soñaba que en el tiempo del estío\r\n        Llevaba, por pasar allí la siesta,\r\n        A beber en el Tajo mi ganado:\r\n        Y despues de llegado,\r\n        Sin saber de qual arte,\r\n        Por desusada parte,\r\n        Y por nuevo camino el agua se iba:\r\n        Ardiendo yo con la calor estiva,\r\n        El curso enajenado iba siguiendo\r\n        Del agua fugitiva.\r\n        Salid sin duelo lágrimas corriendo.\r\n\r\n[165]\r\n\r\n    Mas ya que á socorrerme aqui no vienes,\r\n    No dexes el lugar que tanto amaste;\r\n    Que bien podrás venir de mi segura.\r\n    Yo dexaré el lugar do me dexaste:\r\n    Ven, si por solo esto te detienes.\r\n    Ves aquí un prado lleno de verdura,\r\n    Ves aquí una espesura,\r\n    Ves aquí una agua clara,\r\n    En otro tiempo cara,\r\n    A quien de ti con lágrimas me quexo.\r\n    Quizá aquí hallarás, pues yo me alejo,\r\n    Al que todo mi bien quitarme puede;\r\n    Que pues el bien le dexo,\r\n    No es mucho que el lugar tambien le puede.\r\n\r\n[166]\r\n\r\n        Do están agora aquellos claros ojos,\r\n    Que llevaban tras sí como colgada\r\n    Mi ánima do quier que se volvian?\r\n    Do está la blanca mano delicada\r\n    Llena de vencimientos y despojos,\r\n    Que de mi mis sentidos le ofrecían?\r\n    Los cabellos que vian\r\n    Con gran desprecio al oro\r\n    Como á menor tesoro,\r\n    Adonde están? Adonde el blanco pecho?\r\n    Do la coluna que el dorado techo,\r\n    Con presuncion graciosa sostenía?\r\n    Aquesto todo agora ya se encierra,\r\n    Por desventura mia,\r\n    En la fria, desierta y dura tierra.\r\n\r\n[167]\r\n\r\n        Una parte guardé de tus cabellos,\r\n    Eliza, envueltos en un blanco paño,\r\n    Que nunca de mi seno se me apartan:\r\n    Descójolos, y de un dolor tamaño\r\n    Enternecerme siento, que sobre ellos\r\n    Nunca mis ojos de llorar se hartan,\r\n    Sin que de allí se partan,\r\n    Con suspiros calientes,\r\n    Mas que la llama ardientes,\r\n    Los enxugo del llanto, y de consuno\r\n    Casi los paso y cuento uno á uno:\r\n    Juntándolos con un cordon los ato:\r\n    Tras esto el importuno\r\n    Dolor me dexa descansar un rato.\r\n\r\n[168]\r\n\r\n    Como acontece al mísero doliente,\r\n        Que del un cabo el cierto amigo y sano\r\n        Le muestra el duro mal de su acidente,\r\n    Y le amonesta que del cuerpo humano\r\n        Comience á levantar á mejor parte\r\n        El alma suelta con volar liviano;\r\n    Mas la tierna muger, de la otra parte,\r\n        No se puede entregar al desengaño,\r\n        Y encúbrele del mal la mayor parte:\r\n    El, abrazado con su dulce engaño,\r\n        Vuelve los ojos á la voz piadosa,\r\n        Y alégrase muriendo con su daño:\r\n    Así los quito yo de toda cosa,\r\n        Y póngolos en solo el pensamiento\r\n        De la esperanza cierta ó lastimosa.\r\n    En este dulce error muero contento;\r\n        Porque ver claro, y conocer mi estado\r\n        No puede ya curar el mal que siento;\r\n    Y acabo como aquel que en un templado\r\n        Baño metido sin sentido muere,\r\n        Las venas dulcemente desatado.\r\n\r\n[169] In the title of the edition which I have perused of his _Obras_,\r\n(Madrid, 1610, in 4to.) the word “Hurtado” is omitted, and he is\r\ncalled simply Diego de Mendoza; but the Mendozas are so numerous in\r\nSpanish literature, that it is necessary to pay attention to all the\r\ndistinctions in their names.\r\n\r\n[170]\r\n\r\n    O embaxadores, puros majaderos,\r\n        Que si los reyes quieren engañar,\r\n        Comiençan por nosotros los primeros.\r\n    Nuestro mayor negocio es, no dañar,\r\n        Y jamas hacer cosa, ni dezilla,\r\n        Que no corramos riesgo de enseñar.\r\n\r\nThe passage is in the epistle commencing:\r\n\r\n    Que hace el gran señor de los Romanos.\r\n\r\n[171] They are to be found among his poems with these titles:--“Carta\r\nen redondillas, _estando preso_.”--“Redondillas, _estando preso por una\r\npendencia que tuvo en palacio_.”\r\n\r\n[172] The best life of Mendoza is that which precedes his _Guerra de\r\nGranada, Valencia_, 1776, in quarto. The notices in the fourth volume\r\nof the _Parnaso_ Español are also copious and useful.\r\n\r\n[173] It commences thus:--\r\n\r\n    El no maravillarse hombre de nada\r\n        Me parece, Boscan, ser una cosa,\r\n        Que basta a darnos vida descansada; &c.\r\n\r\n[174] The commencement relates to Boscan’s wife:--\r\n\r\n    Tu la veràs Boscan, y yo la veo,\r\n        Que los que amamos, vemos mas temprano,\r\n        Hela, en cabello negro, y blanco arreo.\r\n    Ella te cogera con blanda mano\r\n        Las raras ubas, y la fruta cana,\r\n        Dulces, y frescos dones del verano.\r\n    Mira que diligencia, con que gana\r\n        Viene al nuevo servicio, que pomposa\r\n        Està con el trabajo, y quan ufana.\r\n    En blanca leche colorada rosa\r\n        Nunca para su amigo vi al pastor\r\n        Mezclar, que pareciesse tan hermosa.\r\n    El verde arrayan tuerce en derredor,\r\n        De tu sagrada frente, con las flores,\r\n        Mezclando oro immortal a la labor.\r\n    Por cima van, y vienen los amores,\r\n        Con las alas en vino remojadas,\r\n        Suenan en el carcax los passadores.\r\n    Remedie quien quisiere las pissadas\r\n        De los grandes, que el mundo governaron,\r\n        Cuyas obras, quiza estan olvidadas.\r\n    Desuelese en lo que ellos no alcançaron,\r\n        Duerma descolorido sobre el oro,\r\n        Que no les quedara mas que llevaron.\r\n    Yo Boscan, no procure otro tesoro,\r\n        Sino poder vivir medianamente,\r\n        Ni escondo la riqueza, ni la adoro.\r\n    Si aqui hallas algun inconveniente,\r\n        Como discreto, y no como yo soy,\r\n    Me desengaña luego incontinente,\r\n        Y sino ven conmigo adonde voy.\r\n\r\n[175]\r\n\r\n    Quantos ay don Luys, que sobre nada\r\n        Haziendo sumtuoso fundamento,\r\n        Tienen la buena suerte por llegada.\r\n    Cansanse con un vano pensamiento,\r\n        Hechan sus conjeturas, y razones,\r\n        Hazen torres vazias en el viento.\r\n    Ensanchan al pensar los coraçones,\r\n        Creen tener en puño la fortuna,\r\n        Y toman por el pie las ocasiones.\r\n    Como los simples niños que en la cuna,\r\n        No saben conocer otro cuydado,\r\n        Sino contar las vigas, una a una,\r\n    Ansi passan la vida en descuydado,\r\n        Y ternan por el mismo, sin mas duda,\r\n        El tiempo por venir con el passado:\r\n    Mas si el viento delante se les muda,\r\n        Y arranca las arenas del profundo,\r\n        No por esso harán vida sessuda.\r\n    No les podra quitar hombre del mundo\r\n        El comer, el dormir, el passear,\r\n        El tenerse por solos sin segundo.\r\n\r\n[176]\r\n\r\n    Otros ay que rebuelven en el seno,\r\n        El tiempo que es passado, y el que tienen,\r\n        Consideran lo suyo por lo ageno.\r\n    Toman las ocasiones que les vienen,\r\n        Y las que no les vienen, van buscando,\r\n        Y con qualquier tiempo se entre tienen.\r\n    El mundo punto a punto van passando\r\n        Los hombres por de dentro, y por defuera\r\n        Como en anatomia examinando.\r\n    Ponen la diligencia en delantera,\r\n        El seso, y la razon por el guarismo,\r\n        Quieren que todo venga a su manera.\r\n    No tienen otra ley, ni otro bautismo,\r\n        Sino lo que les cumple, y por solo esto\r\n        Yran hasta el profundo del abismo.\r\n    Agudos en el cuerpo, y en el gesto,\r\n        Mal ceñidos, las capas arrastradas,\r\n        El ojo abierto, y el caminar presto.\r\n    Si les suceden cosas desastradas,\r\n        Escogen, y proveen lo peor,\r\n        Nadie puede topar con sus pisadas.\r\n    No toman el camino, que es mejor,\r\n        Llano, y trillado, antes al reves,\r\n        Engañanse en el arte, y la labor.\r\n\r\n[177] Words on which elisions are permitted in Italian, as for example,\r\n_dar_, _legger_, _amor_, _peggior_, instead of _dare_, _leggere_,\r\n_amore_, _peggiore_, are in Spanish, by an invariable rule of the\r\nlanguage, written _dar_, _leèr_, _amor_, _peòr_; and, on the other\r\nhand, no poet can presume to omit the terminating vowels in Spanish\r\nwords. A succession of pure feminine rhymes is, therefore, as unnatural\r\nin the Spanish language as in the German. In the Spanish, however,\r\nthe unnatural effect is easily concealed; while in the German, the\r\nincessant recurrence of the semi-mute _e_, in feminine rhymes, is\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\n[178] The following is characteristic, since it presents in a picture\r\nof the poet’s mode of life, the mingled features of Italian refinement\r\nand the Spanish tone of thinking.\r\n\r\n    Aora en la dulce ciencia embevecido,\r\n        Ora en el uso de la ardiente espada,\r\n        Aora con la mano, y el sentido\r\n        Puesto en seguir la plaça levantada,\r\n    Ora el pesado cuerpo estè dormido,\r\n        Aora el alma atenta, y desvelada,\r\n        Siempre en el coraçon tendre esculpido\r\n        Tu ser, y hermosura entretallada.\r\n    Entre gentes estrañas, do se encierra\r\n        El Sol fuera del mundo, y se desvia,\r\n        Durarè, y permanecerè deste arte.\r\n    En el mar, en el cielo, so la tierra,\r\n        Contemplarè la gloria de aquel dia,\r\n        Que tu vista figura en toda parte.\r\n\r\n[179] One of those canciones commences in a sententious way in the\r\nhoratian manner, but it soon degenerates into an obscurity, very unlike\r\nHorace.\r\n\r\n    Tiempo bien empleado,\r\n        Y vida descansada,\r\n        Bien que á pocos, y tarde se consiente\r\n        Olvidar lo passado,\r\n        Holgar con lo presente,\r\n        Y de lo por venir, no curar nada,\r\n        Hora falta, y menguada\r\n        La del que nunca olvida\r\n        Un cuydado que siempre le da pena.\r\n        Cortado à su medida\r\n        Tan importuna, y llena,\r\n        Que ni otro halla entrada, ni el salida,\r\n        Mas tiene por testigo\r\n        Su pensamiento, y este es su enemigo.\r\n\r\n[180] See the Introduction, page 20.\r\n\r\n[181] For example:--\r\n\r\n    Hagame lugar\r\n    El placer un dia!\r\n    Dexame contar\r\n    Esta pena mia!\r\n\r\n[182] The following are the first stanzas of a song, which he composed\r\nin prison, after his extraordinary adventure in the court of Madrid:--\r\n\r\n    Triste, y aspera fortuna\r\n        Un preso tiene afligido,\r\n        Mas no por esso vencido\r\n        Con la fuerça de ninguna.\r\n    Entre sus cuydados vive,\r\n        Ellos mismos le atormentan,\r\n        Mil muertes le representan,\r\n        Y las mas dellos recibe.\r\n    Y aunque no se rinde al peso\r\n        De tantas penas, y enojos,\r\n        Rinde à Filis los despojos\r\n        De sus entrañas, y seso.\r\n    Tristezas, y soledades,\r\n        Y quexas muy apretadas,\r\n        Que sino son declaradas,\r\n        A lo menos son verdades.\r\n\r\n[183] In a half comic song, he describes jealousy (in Spanish\r\n_los zelos_, jealous thoughts), in a series of very odd, negative\r\ncomparisons;--for example:\r\n\r\n    No es padre, suegro, ni yerno,\r\n        Ni es hijo, hermano, ni tio,\r\n        Ni es mar, arroyo, ni rio,\r\n        Ni es verano, ni es invierno,\r\n        Ni es otoño, ni es estio.\r\n    No es ave, ni es animal,\r\n        Ni es Luna, sombra ni Sol,\r\n        Vequadrado, ni vemol,\r\n        Piedra, planta, ni metal,\r\n        Ni pece, ni caracol.\r\n    Tampoco es noche, ni dia,\r\n        Ni hora, ni mes, ni año,\r\n        Ni es lienço, seda, ni paño,\r\n        Ni es Latin, ni Algaravia,\r\n        Ni es ogaño, ni fue antaño\r\n\r\n[184] The only editions of the _vida de Lazarillo de Tormes_ now in\r\ncirculation, are printed after that published at Saragossa, in the year\r\n1652, with de Luna’s corrections and continuation.\r\n\r\n[185] A new edition of this work, which is entitled:--_Guerra de\r\nGranada, que hizo el rey don Felipe II. &c. Escriviòla D. Diego Hurtado\r\nde Mendoza_, has been mentioned in the note, p. 193. It is in fact\r\nthe first correct edition, for in it the original text is restored by\r\ncollation with the genuine MS.\r\n\r\n[186] This affectation of style is particularly observable in the\r\nProœmium; and therefore that part of the work does not create a very\r\nfavourable prepossession towards the author, in the mind of the\r\nimpartial critic:--\r\n\r\nBien sè que muchas cosas de las que escriviere pareceràn a algunos\r\nlivianas, i menudas para Historia, comparadas a las grandes, que de\r\nEspaña se hallan escritas; Guerras largas de varios sucesos, tomas\r\ni desolaciones de Ciudades populosas, Reyes vencidos i presos,\r\ndiscordias entre padres i hijos, hermanos i hermanas, suegros i\r\nhiernos, desposeidos, restituidos, i otra vez desposeidos, muertos\r\na hierro, acabados linages, mudadas successiones de Reinos; libre i\r\nestendido campo, i ancha salida para los Escritores. Yo escogi camino\r\nmas estrecho, trabajoso, esteril, i sin gloria; pero provechoso, i de\r\nfruto para los que adelante vinieren; comienzos bajos, rebelion de\r\nsalteadores, junta de esclavos, tumulto de villanos, competencias,\r\nodios, ambiciones, i pretensiones; dilacion de provisiones, falta de\r\ndinero, inconvenientes o no creidos, o tenidos en poco.\r\n\r\n[187] For example:\r\n\r\nPorque la Inquisicion los comenzò a apretar mas de lo ordinario.\r\nEl Rei les mandò dejar la habla Morisca, i con ella el comercio i\r\ncomunicacion entre si; quitòseles el servicio de los Esclavos negros\r\na quienes criavan con esperanzas de hijos, el habito Morisco en que\r\ntenian empleado gran caudal; obligaronlos a vestir Castellano con\r\nmucha costa, que las mugeres trugesen los rostros descubiertos, que\r\nlas casas acostumbradas a estar cerradas estuviesen abiertas: lo uno\r\ni lo otro tan grave de sufrir entre gente celosa. Huvo fama que les\r\nmandavan tomar los hijos, i pasallos a Castilla. Vedaronles el uso de\r\nlos baños, que eran su limpieza i entrenimiento; primero les havian\r\nprohibido la Musica, cantares, fiestas, bodas, conforme a su costumbre,\r\ni qualesquier juntas de pasatiempo. Saliò todo esto junto sin guardia,\r\nni provision de gente; sin reforzar presidios viejos, o firmar otros\r\nnuevos.\r\n\r\n[188] This speech is forcibly written, and the style is no where\r\ndisfigured by rhetorical ornament. The following is one of its most\r\npowerful passages:--\r\n\r\nQuien quita que el hombre de Lengua Castellana no pueda tener la lei\r\ndel Profeta? i el de la lengua Morisca la lei de Jesus? llaman a\r\nnuestros hijos a sus Congregaciones i casas de letras, enseñanles artes\r\nque nuestros mayores prohibieron aprenderse; porque no se confundiese\r\nla puridad, i se hiciese litigiosa la verdad de la lei. Cada hora nos\r\namenazan quitarlos de los brazos de sus madres, i de la crianza de sus\r\npadres, i pasarlos a tierras agenas; donde olviden nuestra manera de\r\nvida, i aprendan a ser enemigos de los padres que los engendramos, i\r\nde las madres que los parieron. Mandannos dejar nuestro habito, vestir\r\nel Castellano. Vistense entre ellos los Tudescos de una manera, los\r\nFranceses de otra, los Griegos de otra, los Frailes de otra, los mozos\r\nde otra, i de otra los viejos; cada Nacion, cada profesion i cada\r\nestado usa su manera de vestido, i todos son Christianos; i nosotros\r\nMoros, porque vestimos a la Morisca; como si truxesemos la lei en el\r\nvestido, i no en el corazon.\r\n\r\n[189] Demàs desto proveerse de vitualla, eligir lugar en la montaña\r\ndonde guardalla, fabricar armas, reparar las que de mucho tiempo tenian\r\nescondidas, comprar nuevas, i avisar de nuevo a los Reyes de Argel,\r\nFez, Señor de Tituan desta resolucion i preparaciones.\r\n\r\n[190] In the year 1737, that excellent critic Mayans, in allusion to\r\nDiego de Mendoza’s _Guerra de Granada_, observes:--Deve leerse, como el\r\nla escriviò. Quiere Dios que algun dia la publique yo! (_Orig. de la\r\nLingua Española_, vol. i. p. 205). Thus even at that period a genuine\r\nedition, such as Mayans wished to superintend, could not be published.\r\n\r\n[191] Dieze, it is true, alledges the contrary, in his notes on\r\nVelasquez; but it appears that he was acquainted only with the pastoral\r\npoems, and not with the other works of Saa de Miranda.\r\n\r\n[192] These Spanish pastoral poems are mingled indiscriminately with\r\nthe Portuguese poems of the same author, in the neatly printed edition\r\nof the _Obras do Doctor Francisco de Sà de Miranda, Lisboa_, 1784, in 2\r\nvols. 8vo. No attention has been paid to the correction of the Spanish\r\npoems in this collection, and Portuguese words continually occur in\r\nthem; for example, _as_ for _las_, _pensamentos_ for _pensamientos_,\r\n_outro_ for _otro_, &c. The orthography of the title-page is uncommon;\r\nfor in other cases the Portuguese spelling is not _doctor_, but\r\n_doutor_, and _Sà_ is a modern substitution for _Saa_.\r\n\r\n[193] The following stanza may certainly claim a place in the best epic\r\npoem.\r\n\r\n    Como el pino en el monte combalido\r\n        Del impetuoso viento en la tormenta,\r\n        A quantos que lo ven pone en recelo,\r\n        Los truenos amenazan, arrebienta\r\n        El fuego por las nuves, exlo erguido,\r\n        Exlo coruo que vâ cayendo al suelo,\r\n        Hasta tanto que el Cielo\r\n        Se abre en llama ardiendo,\r\n        Entre viendo, y no viendo,\r\n        El bravo rayo en bueltas mil desciende,\r\n        Aquel prostrero mal quien se defiende?\r\n        Queda un tronco quemado, y cuento breve,\r\n        A quien passa porende,\r\n        O busca alli quiça que a casa lleve.\r\n\r\n[194] For example:--\r\n\r\n    Graciosamente estando,\r\n    Graciosamente andando,\r\n    Blando ayre respirava al prado ameno.\r\n    Ella cantava, y juntamente el seno\r\n    Inchiendose yva de diversas flores,\r\n    En que el prado era lleno\r\n    Sobre verde variado en mil colores.\r\n\r\n[195] For instance, the following passage in the second eclogue:--\r\n\r\n        A que parte se es yda esta alma mia?\r\n    Quien me la enseñarà? yo que hago aqui?\r\n    Sin alguno de dos, que antes tenia?\r\n    Que entr’ambas se ajuntáran contra mi?\r\n    Solo dexado me han, ciego, y sin guia.\r\n    Pareceos esto amor? dexarme ansi?\r\n    Consigo no quisieran allà llevarme\r\n    Ni buelto me han a ver, ni a consolarme.\r\n        Como una llama por el monte ardiente,\r\n    Que presto en alto buela, y no parece,\r\n    De vista se nos pierde en continente,\r\n    Y el humo turbio solo remanece,\r\n    Otra tal claridad resplandeciente,\r\n    Mientras mirando estava, eis se escurece\r\n    Ansi tan presto? triste a donde yrè?\r\n    Sin ti y allá sin ti, triste que harè?\r\n\r\n[196] Can any thing be more charming than the following passage from\r\nthe seventh eclogue? A nymph gazes on a sleeping shepherd.\r\n\r\n    Duerme el hermoso donzel,\r\n        No zagal, no pastor, no,\r\n        Mientras al sueño se diò,\r\n        Mi alma diosele a el.\r\n        El Sol es alto, y con el\r\n        Del dia, es ido un buen trecho\r\n        No sè que de mi se hà hecho,\r\n        Serà lo que fuere del.\r\n    Loca de mi, que a mirar\r\n        Me puse, y dixe tal viendo,\r\n        Quien tanto aplaze dormiendo,\r\n        Despierto, que es de pensar?\r\n        Quiseme luego apartar,\r\n        No se quien me buelve aqui.\r\n        Ah quan tarde que entendi,\r\n        Que peligro es començar.\r\n\r\n[197] For example, the apostrophe to the dead Diego, in the first\r\neclogue.\r\n\r\n    Vete buen Diego en paz, que en esta tierra\r\n        El plazer de oy no dura hasta mañana,\r\n        Y dura mucho quanto desaplaze.\r\n        Allâ aora no ves la vision vana,\r\n        Que acá viviendo te hizo tanta guerra,\r\n        Ardiendo el cuerpo que ora frio yaze,\r\n        Lo que allà satisfaze\r\n        A tus ya claros ojos,\r\n        No son vanos antojos\r\n        De que ay por estos cerros muchedumbre:\r\n        Mas siempre una paz buena en clara lumbre:\r\n        Contentamiento cierto te acompaña,\r\n        No tanta pesadumbre,\r\n        Como acà va por esta tierra estraña.\r\n\r\n[198] For example, in the second eclogue:--\r\n\r\n    Aur. Que quiere (ò mi Mauricio) dezir tal\r\n        Huviar de perros como a la porfia?\r\n        No se que sean cierto, es algun gran mal:\r\n        Aves nocturnas buelvan entre dia;\r\n        Lobos tan bravos de su natural,\r\n        Buscan a la Aldea de la Serrania.\r\n        No vees el mal gusano, y que pesares\r\n        Se hà hecho de las viñas, y pomares?\r\n    Una mula hà parido en nuestra Aldea,\r\n        Y las vacas no paren; ayer cayò\r\n        Del Cielo un breve que no ay quien lo lea\r\n        Son crego, o frayle, que yà Missa cantò,\r\n        Con dos cabeças (cosa estraña, y fea)\r\n        Un potro, y con seispies (diz) que nascio.\r\n        Como Gallos nos cantan las Gallinas,\r\n        Y no se vieran ogaño Golondrinas.\r\n\r\n[199] As for example, in the fifth eclogue:--\r\n\r\n    Dime pastor de cabras alquilado,\r\n        (Y no te enojes con la tal demanda,\r\n        Que me echas un mal ojo atravessado)\r\n    A quien embiò Toribia la guirlanda\r\n        Que ella traya sobre sus cabellos?\r\n        Cantando, con que boz, clara, y quan blanda?\r\n    Y a quien embiava juntamente aquellos\r\n        Sus ojos que d’Amor son corredores,\r\n        Que se yva el mismo Amor embuelto en ellos?\r\n    Mañana de San Juan, quando a las flores\r\n        Y al agua todos salen, quien tal gala\r\n        Viò nunca, y tal donayre entre pastores?\r\n    Ora que parecia alli Pascuala?\r\n        Y Menga que? Costança, y la Perona?\r\n        Aquellas, que a su ver quien las yguala?\r\n    Que gracia, que blandura, y que persona,\r\n        Que color de una Rosa a la mañana,\r\n        Que al despuntar del Sol s’abre y corona?\r\n\r\n[200] The following is a specimen:--\r\n\r\n    Sola me dexaste\r\n        En aquel hiermo,\r\n        Villano malo Gallego.\r\n    Voyme a do te fuyste,\r\n        Voyme no sè a donde.\r\n        El valle responde,\r\n        Tu no respondiste.\r\n        Moça sola ay triste,\r\n        Que llorando ciego\r\n        Tu passaslo en juego.\r\n    Por hiermos agenos\r\n        Lloro, y grito en vano.\r\n        Gallego, y villano,\r\n        Que esperava yo menos?\r\n        Ojos de agua llenos,\r\n        Vòs pecho de fuego\r\n        Quando avreis sossiego?\r\n\r\n[201] The biographical notices of Jorge de Montemayor, prefixed to the\r\nninth volume of the Parnaso Español, do not exactly correspond with\r\nthose by Nicolas Antonio.\r\n\r\n[202] Passages of real delicacy are not, however, wanting; for\r\nexample:--\r\n\r\n    No me diste, o crudo amor,\r\n        El bien que tuve en presencia,\r\n        Sino porque el mal de ausencia\r\n        Me parezca muy mayor.\r\n    Das descanso, das reposo,\r\n        No por dar contentamiento,\r\n        Mas porque este el suffrimiento\r\n        Algun tiempo ocioso:\r\n        Ved que invenciones de Amor,\r\n        Darme contento en presencia,\r\n        Porque no tenga en ausencia\r\n        Reparo contra el dolor.\r\n\r\n[203] The following song, with which the lyric gallery opens, may be\r\nquoted as an instance:--\r\n\r\n      Cabellos, quanta mudança\r\n    He visto despues que os vi,\r\n    Y quan mal parece ay\r\n    Essa color de esperanza.\r\n      Bien pensava yo, cabellos,\r\n    (Aunque con algun temor)\r\n    Que no fuera otro pastor\r\n    Digno de verse cabe ellos.\r\n      Ay cabellos! quantos dias\r\n    La mi Diana mirava,\r\n    Si os traya, o si os dexava,\r\n    Y otros cien mil niñerias?\r\n      Y quantas vezes llorando\r\n    Ay lagrimas engañosas\r\n    Pedia celos de cosas\r\n    De que yo estava burlando.\r\n      Los ojos que me matavan,\r\n    Dezid, dorados cabellos,\r\n    Que culpa tuve en creellos\r\n    Pues ellos me asseguravan.\r\n      No vistes vos que algun dia\r\n    Mil lagrimas derramava\r\n    Hasta que yo le jurava\r\n    Que sus palabras creya?\r\n      Quien vio tanta hermosura\r\n    En tan mudable sujeto?\r\n    Y en amador tan perfeto\r\n    Quien vio tanta desventura?\r\n      O cabellos no os correys!\r\n    Por venir de a do venistes,\r\n    Viendome como me vistes,\r\n    En verme como me veys.\r\n      Sobre el arena sentada\r\n    De aquel rio la vi yo,\r\n    Do con el dedo escrivio\r\n    _Antes muerta que mudada_.\r\n      Mira el Amor que ordena\r\n    Que os viene hazer creer\r\n    Cosas dichas por muger\r\n    Y escritas en el arena.\r\n\r\n[204] For example, the following _Villancico_, which has been\r\nfrequently imitated:--\r\n\r\n    Contentamientos de amor\r\n      Que tan cansados llegays,\r\n      Si venis, paraque os vays?\r\n    Aun no acabays de venir\r\n       Despues de muy desseados,\r\n       Quando estays determinados\r\n       De madrugar y partir,\r\n       Si tan presto os aveys de yr,\r\n       Y tan triste me dexays,\r\n       Plazeres no me veays.\r\n     Los contentos huyo dellos,\r\n       Pues no me vienen à ver,\r\n       Mas que por darme à entender\r\n       Lo que se pierde en perdellos:\r\n       Y pues ya no quiero vellos,\r\n       Descontentos no os partays,\r\n       Pues bolveys despues que os vays.\r\n\r\n[205] One of the most beautiful lyrical pieces that ever was composed\r\nin any language, is a cancion by Montemayor, of which the following are\r\nthe three first stanzas. Diana is supposed to be singing:--\r\n\r\n        Ojos, que ya no veis quien os miraba\r\n    quando erades espejo en que se via,\r\n    qué cosa podeis ver que os dé contento?\r\n    Prado florido y verde, dó algun dia\r\n    por él mi dulce amigo yo esperaba,\r\n    llorad conmigo el grave mal que siento.\r\n    Aqui me declaró su pensamiento,\r\n    oile yo cuitáda\r\n    mas que serpiente ayrada,\r\n    llamandole mil veces atrevido:\r\n    y el triste alli rendido:\r\n    parece que es ahora, y que le veo,\r\n    y aun ese es mi deseo:\r\n    ay si ahora le viese! ay tiempo bueno!\r\n    Ribera umbrosa, qué es de mi Sireno?\r\n        Aquella es la ribera, este es el prado,\r\n    de allí parece el soto y valle umbroso\r\n    que yo con mi rebaño repastaba:\r\n    veis el arroyo dulce y sonoroso\r\n    dó pacia la siesta mi ganado,\r\n    quando mi dulce amigo aqui moraba,\r\n    debajo aquella haya verde estaba;\r\n    y veis alli el otero\r\n    a dò le ví primero,\r\n    y dò me vió, dichoso fue aquel dia,\r\n    si la desdicha mia\r\n    un tiempo tan dichoso no acabára.\r\n    O haya, o fuente clara!\r\n    todo está aqui, mas no por quien yo peno.\r\n    Ribera umbrosa, qué es de mi Sireno?\r\n        Aqui tengo un retrato que me engaña,\r\n    pues veo a mi pastor quando lo veo,\r\n    aunque en mi alma está mejor sacado:\r\n    quando de velle llega el gran deseo,\r\n    de quien el tiempo luego desengaña.\r\n    A aquella fuente voy que está en el prado,\r\n    arrimomele al sauce, y a su lado\r\n    me siento, ay amor ciego!\r\n    al agua miro luego,\r\n    y veo él y a mì como le via\r\n    quando él aqui vivia:\r\n    esta invencion un rato me sustenta,\r\n    despues caygo en la cuenta,\r\n    y dice el corazon de ansias lleno:\r\n    Ribera umbrosa, qué es de mi Sireno? &c.\r\n\r\n[206] See vol. ii. of my History of Italian Poetry and Eloquence.\r\n\r\n[207] For example:--\r\n\r\nConsiderava que sus servicios eran sin esperança de galardon, cosa que\r\na quien tuviera menos firmeza pudiera facilmente atajar el camino de\r\nsus amores. Mas era tanta su constancia, que puesta en medio de todas\r\nlas causas la que tenia de olvidar a quien no se acordava del, salia\r\ntan a su salvo dellas, y tan sin prejuyzio del amor que a su pastora\r\ntenia, que sin miedo alguno acometia qualquiera imaginacion que en daño\r\nde su fe le sobreviniesse. Pues como vio à Sireno junto à la fuente\r\nquedo muy espantado de verle assi tan triste: no porque el ignorasse la\r\ncausa de su tristeza, mas porque le parecio que si el huviera recebido\r\nel mas pequeño favor que Sireno algun tiempo recibio de Diana, aquel\r\ncontentamiento bastara para toda la vida tenerle.\r\n\r\n[208] On one occasion, the beautiful Felismene calls love a _devilish_\r\npassion. Lo que siento desta _endiablada_ passion, she says in the\r\nsecond book.\r\n\r\n[209] He thus describes the savage robbers by whom the nymphs are\r\nattacked:--\r\n\r\nVenian armados de cosseletes, y celadas de cuero de tigre:--eran de tan\r\nfea catadura, que ponian espanto los cosseletes. Trayan por braçaletes\r\nunas bocas de serpientes, por donde sacavan los braços, que gruessos\r\ny vellosos parecian: y las celadas venian a hazer encima de la frente\r\nunas espantables cabeças de leones. Lo de mas trayan desnudo, cubierto\r\nde espesso y largo vello, unos bastones herrados de muy agudas puntas\r\nde azero. Trayan al cuello sus arcos y flechas: los escudos eran de\r\nunas conchas de pescado muy fuerte.\r\n\r\n[210] For instance, the sage Felicia thus philosophizes on love and\r\nvirtue:--\r\n\r\nEn estos casos de amor tengo yo una regla, que siempre la he hallado\r\nmuy verdadera, y es que el animo generoso, y el entendimiento delicado,\r\nen esto del querer bien, lleva grandissima ventaja al que no lo es.\r\nPorque como el amor sea virtud, y la virtud siempre haga assiento en\r\nle mejor lugar, esta claro que las personas de suerte seran muy mejor\r\nenamorades que aquellas à quien esta falta.\r\n\r\n[211] See the notices in Dieze’s remarks on Velasquez, p. 91, in which\r\nthe different editions of the Diana are likewise mentioned.\r\n\r\n[212] Even this slender notice of the life of Herrera, which is partly\r\nextracted from Nicolas Antonio, and partly from the seventh volume of\r\nthe _Parnaso Español_, seems to be rather matter of conjecture, than\r\nhistorically authentic.\r\n\r\n[213] He framed the new words, _reluchar_, _ovoso_, _purpurar_,\r\n_ensañarse_, from the Castilian _luchar_, _ova_, _purpura_, and _saña_:\r\nand he derived from the latin the words _beligero_, _flamigero_,\r\n_horrisono_.\r\n\r\n[214] Among the modern admirers of Herrera, Don Ramon Fernandez, in the\r\npreface to the fifth volume of his collection of Spanish poems, speaks\r\nwith enthusiasm of the language of that poet. The fifth and sixth\r\nvolumes of the collection (Madrid 1786), contain the _Rimas de Fernando\r\nde Herrera_.\r\n\r\n[215] Occasionally his descriptions seem to be imitated from Petrarch,\r\nthough the imitation is, in some measure, concealed by the Spanish\r\nstyle of expression; for example, in the following stanza:\r\n\r\n        Ya subo a pena, y nunca descansando,\r\n    Por yertos riscos, pasos despeñados,\r\n    Ya en hondos valles baxo con presteza,\r\n    Lugares de las fieras no tratados,\r\n    El pensamiento en ellos variando.\r\n    Un frio horror y subita tristeza.\r\n    Roba el vigor, y engendra la flaqueza:\r\n    Qualquier soplo de viento, que resuena\r\n    Entre árboles desnudos quebrantado,\r\n    Aqueja la esperanza y el cuidado,\r\n    Que piensa ser la causa de su pena:\r\n    Pero luego engañado\r\n    Hallo el cuidado y la esperanza vana,\r\n    Que, como sombra, se me va liviana;\r\n    Mas luego en la memoria Amor despierta,\r\n    Para cobrar su bien, la gloria muerta.\r\n\r\n[216] The following is the commencement of one of the odes on the\r\nbattle of Lepanto, imitated from Horace’s _Descende cælo, Caliope_.\r\n\r\n        Desciende de la cumbre de Parnaso,\r\n    Cantando dulcemente en noble lira,\r\n    O tú, de eterna juventud, Talia,\r\n    Y nuevo aliento al corazon me inspira\r\n    Aqui, donde el torcido y luengo paso\r\n    Betis al hondo mar corriente envia;\r\n    Porque de la voz mia\r\n    Suene el canto, y florezca la memoria\r\n    Hasta el término roxo de oriente,\r\n    Y do al Númida ardiente\r\n    Abrasa Iperion; y en alta gloria\r\n    El nombre de la insigne Esperia planta;\r\n    Que de Córdoba y Cerda se levanta,\r\n    Aquiste honor; y al zéfiro templado\r\n    Ensalce este Lucero venerado.\r\n        Los despojos, y en árboles alzados\r\n    Los insignes trofeos, el sangriento\r\n    Conflicto del feroz dudoso Marte;\r\n    Las enseñas, que mueve en torno el viento;\r\n    Los presos, y los Reynos conquistados\r\n    Con segura prudencia, esfuerzo, y arte;\r\n    Que dieron tanta parte\r\n    De la rota, y herida, y muerta Francia\r\n    Al que fue prez y honor del orbe Hispano;\r\n    Que al sobervio Otomano\r\n    Quebró en las Jonias ondas la arrogancia,\r\n    Y en la Ausonia adquirió el heroyco nombre\r\n    Con mas valor, que cabe en mortal hombre;\r\n    Con alas de vitoria al fin levantan\r\n    Las vitorias, que Europa y Asia cantan.\r\n\r\n[217] In the original, the extravagance of this pompous rodomontade is\r\nstill more striking:\r\n\r\n        Todo quanto al terrestre el cuerpo alienta,\r\n    De la celeste fuerza deducido,\r\n    Se halla en vos casi en igual efeto.\r\n    De vos el fixo globo, y el tendido\r\n    Humor, y el vago cerca se sustenta,\r\n    Y el ardor de las llamas inquieto:\r\n    Que con vigor secreto\r\n    A tierra y agua, al ayre y puro fuego,\r\n    Qual eterea virtud, y las estrellas,\r\n    Son vuestras obras bellas\r\n    La tierra, la agua, el ayre, el puro fuego.\r\n    O glorioso cielo en nuestro suelo!\r\n    O suelo glorioso con tal cielo!\r\n    Quièn podrá celebrar vuestra nobleza?\r\n    Quièn osará alabar vuestra belleza?\r\n\r\n[218] In the following, from one of his odes on the battle of Lepanto,\r\nthe style of the Hebrew psalms is imitated with happy effect.\r\n\r\n        El sobervio Tirano, confiado\r\n    En el grande aparato de sus naves,\r\n    Que de los nuestros la cerviz cautiva,\r\n    Y las manos aviva\r\n    Al ministerio injusto de su estado,\r\n    Derribò con los brazos suyos graves\r\n    Los cedros mas excelsos de la cima;\r\n    Y el árbol, que mas yerto se sublima,\r\n    Bebiendo agenas aguas, y atrevido\r\n    Pisando el vando nuestro y defendido.\r\n        Temblaron los pequeños, confundidos\r\n    Del impio furor suyo, alzó la frente\r\n    Contra tí, Señor Dios; y con semblante\r\n    Y con pecho arrogante,\r\n    Y los armados brazos estendidos,\r\n    Movió el ayrado cuello aquel potente:\r\n    Cercó su corazon de ardiente saña\r\n    Contra las dos Esperias, que el mar baña;\r\n    Porque en tí confiadas le resisten,\r\n    Y de armas de tu fe y amor se visten.\r\n        Dixo aquel insolente y desdeñoso;\r\n    No conocen mis iras estas tierras,\r\n    Y de mis padres los ilustres hechos?\r\n    O valieron sus pechos\r\n    Contra ellos con el Ungaro medroso,\r\n    Y de Dalmacia y Rodas en las guerras?\r\n    Quién las pudo librar? quien de sus manos\r\n    Pudo salvar los de Austria y los Germanos?\r\n    Podrá su Dios, podrá por suerte ahora\r\n    Guardallas de mi diestra vencedora?\r\n\r\n[219] The whole ode may be transcribed here, as a specimen of Herrera’s\r\nlyric composition in the ode style:--\r\n\r\n        Suave sueño, tú que en tarde buelo\r\n    Las alas perezosas blandamente\r\n    Bates, de adormideras coronado,\r\n    Por el puro, adormido, y vago cielo;\r\n    Ven á la última parte de ocidente,\r\n    Y de licor sagrado\r\n    Baña mis ojos tristes, que cansado,\r\n    Y rendido al furor de mi tormento,\r\n    No admito algun sosiego,\r\n    Y el dolor desconorta al sufrimiento.\r\n    Ven à mi humilde ruego,\r\n    Ven à mi ruego humilde, ó amor de aquella,\r\n    Que Juno te ofreció, tu ninfa bella.\r\n        Divino sueño, gloria de mortales,\r\n    Regalo dulce al misero afligido,\r\n    Sueño amoroso, ven á quien espera\r\n    Cesar del exercicio de sus males,\r\n    Y al descanso volver todo el sentido.\r\n    Cómo sufres, que muera\r\n    Lejos de tu poder, quien tuyo era?\r\n    No es dureza olvidar un solo pecho\r\n    En veladora pena,\r\n    Que sin gozar del bien, que al mundo has hecho,\r\n    De tu vigor se agena?\r\n    Ven, sueño alegre, sueño ven dichoso,\r\n    Vuelve à mi alma ya, vuelve el reposo.\r\n        Sienta yo en tal estrecha tu grandeza;\r\n    Baxa, y esparce liquido el rocio;\r\n    Huya la Alva, que en torno resplandece;\r\n    Mira mi ardiente llanto y mi tristeza,\r\n    Y quánta fuerza tiene el pesar mio,\r\n    Y mi frente humedece,\r\n    Que ya de fuegos juntos el sol crece.\r\n    Torna, sabroso sueño, y tus hermosas\r\n    Alas suenen ahora;\r\n    Y huya con sus alas presurosas\r\n    La desabrida Aurora:\r\n    Y lo que en mí faltó la noche fria,\r\n    Termine la cercana luz del dia.\r\n        Una corona, ó sueño, de tus flores\r\n    Ofrezco, tu produce el blando efeto\r\n    En los desiertos cercos de mis ojos;\r\n    Que el ayre entretexido con olores\r\n    Halaga, y ledo mueve en dulce afeto;\r\n    Y de estos mis enojos\r\n    Destierra, manso sueño, los despojos,\r\n    Ven pues, amado sueño, ven liviano,\r\n    Que del rico oriente\r\n    Despunta el tierno Febo el rayo cano.\r\n    Ven ya, sueño clemente,\r\n    Y acabará el dolor, a si te vea\r\n    En brazos de tu cara Pasitea.\r\n\r\n[220] I have perused two different editions of Herrera’s poems: 1st.\r\nan old one, entitled, _Versos de Fernando de Herrera_, &c. Sevilla,\r\n1619, in quarto; and 2nd. the more modern edition, already mentioned,\r\npublished by Ramon Fernandez, which contains some poems not before\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n[221]\r\n\r\n        A dó tienes la luz, Espero mio,\r\n    La luz, gloria y honor del Ocidente?\r\n    Estás puesto en el cielo reluciente\r\n    En importuno tiempo, y seco estio?\r\n        Lleva tu resplandor al sacro rio,\r\n    Que tu belleza espera alegremente,\r\n    Y el zéfiro te sea otro oriente,\r\n    Hecho lucero, y no Espero tardio.\r\n        Merezca Betis fértil tanta gloria,\r\n    Que solo el destas luces illustrado\r\n    A tierra y cielo lleva la vitoria.\r\n        Que tu belleza y resplandor sagrado\r\n    Hará perpetuo, de immortal memoria,\r\n    Mientras corriere al mar arrebatado.\r\n\r\n[222]\r\n\r\n    Yo vì a mi dulce Lumbre, que esparcia\r\n    Sus crespas ondas de oro al manso viento.\r\n\r\n[223] It is annexed to Herrera’s edition of the _Obras de Garcilaso de\r\nla Vega_. _Sevilla_, 1580, 4_to._\r\n\r\n[224] The following is the original Spanish of the passage here cited,\r\nwith a part of the continuation, which is all in the same style:--\r\n\r\nConviene que la elegia sea candida, blanda, tierna, suave, delienda,\r\ntersa, clara i, si con esto se puede declarar, noble, congoxosa en\r\nlos afetos, i que los mueva en toda parte, ni mui hinchada, ni mui\r\numilde, no oscura con esquisitas sentencias i fabulas mui buscadas;\r\nque tenga frequente comiseracion, quexas, esclamaciones, apostrofos,\r\nprosopopeyas, escursos o parébases, el ornato della à de ser mas\r\nlimpio i reluziente, que peinado i compuesto curiosamente i porque\r\nlos escritores de versos amorosos o esperan, o desesperan, o deshazen\r\nsus pensamientos, i induzen otros nuevos, i los mudan i pervierten,\r\no ruegan, o se quexan, o alegran, o alaban la hermosura de su dama,\r\no esplican su propria vida, i cuentan sus fortunas con los demas\r\nsentimientos del animo, que ellos declaran en varias ocasiones;\r\nconviniendo que este genero de poesia sea misto, que aora habla el\r\npoeta, aora introduze otra persona.\r\n\r\n[225] There is a life of Luis de Leon, prefixed to the latest edition\r\nof his _Obras propias y traducciones_ (Valencia, 1762, 8vo.) by\r\nMayans y Siscar; it is, however, confusedly and carelessly written.\r\nThe biographical memoir prefixed to the sixth volume of the _Parnaso\r\nEspañol_ is better.\r\n\r\n[226] This statement occurs in the dedication prefixed to his\r\nexplanation of the sixty-second Psalm, addressed to the Grand\r\nInquisitor, Cardinal Don Caspar de Quiroga.\r\n\r\n[227] Apartado no solo de la conversacion y compañia de los hombres,\r\nsino tambien de la vista, por casi cinque años estuve cercado en una\r\ncarcel y en tinieblas. Entonces gozava yo de tal quietud y alegria de\r\nanimo, que agora muchas vezes echo menos, aviendo sido restituido a la\r\nluz, y gozando del trato de los hombres, que me son amigos.\r\n\r\n[228] See the dedication of his poems to Don Pedro Portocarrero.\r\n\r\n[229] How highly Cervantes esteemed Luis de Leon, may be seen from a\r\npassage in his Galatea, in which one of the characters says:--\r\n\r\n    Fray Luis de Leon es quel que digo,\r\n    A quien yo reverencio, _adoro_, y sigo.\r\n\r\n[230] The first ode commences thus:--\r\n\r\n        Que descansada vida\r\n    la del que huye el mundanal ruido,\r\n    y sigue la escondida\r\n    senda, por donde han ido\r\n    los pocos sabios que en el mundo han sido.\r\n        Que no le enturbia el pecho\r\n    de los sobervios grandes el estado,\r\n    ni del dorado techo\r\n    se admira fabricado\r\n    del sabio Moro, en jaspes sustentado.\r\n        No cura si la fama\r\n    canta con voz su nombre pregonera,\r\n    ni cura si encarama\r\n    la lengua lisonjera\r\n    lo què condena la verdad sincera.\r\n\r\n[231] For example, in the following stanzas from the same ode:--\r\n\r\n        Del monte en la ladera\r\n    por mi mano plantado tengo un huerto,\r\n    que con la Primavera\r\n    de bella flor cubierto\r\n    ya muestra en esperança el fruto cierto.\r\n        Y como codiciosa,\r\n    por ver y acrecentar su hermosura,\r\n    desde la cumbre ayrosa\r\n    una fontana pura\r\n    hasta llegar corriendo se ápresura.\r\n        Y luego sossegada,\r\n    el passo entre los arboles torciendo,\r\n    el suelo de passada\r\n    de verdura vistiendo,\r\n    y con diversas flores va esparciendo.\r\n\r\n[232] For example in the stanza:--\r\n\r\n    En vano el mar fatiga\r\n    La vela _Portuguesa_, que ni _el seno_\r\n    _De Persia_, ni la amiga\r\n    _Malacca_ da arbol bueno,\r\n    Que pueda hacer un animo sereno.\r\n\r\n[233] The following is the best half:--\r\n\r\n        Quando contemplo el cielo\r\n    de innumerables luces adornado,\r\n    y miro hazia el suelo\r\n    de noche rodeado,\r\n    en sueño y en olvido sepultado;\r\n        El amor y la pena\r\n    despiertan en mi pecho un ansia ardiente,\r\n    despide larga vena\r\n    los ojos hechos fuente,\r\n    Oloarte, y digo al fin con voz doliente:\r\n        Morada de grandeza,\r\n    templo de claridad y hermosura,\r\n    el alma que al tu alteza\r\n    naciò, que desventura\r\n    la tiene en esta carcel baxa escura?\r\n        Que mortal desatino\r\n    de la verdad alexa assi el sentido,\r\n    que de tu bien divino\r\n    olvidado, perdido\r\n    sigue la vana sombra, el bien fingido?\r\n\r\n[234]\r\n\r\n        Quando serà que pueda\r\n    libre desta prision bolar al cielo,\r\n    Felipe, y en la rueda,\r\n    que huye mas del suelo,\r\n    contemplar la verdad pura sin duelo?\r\n        Alli à mi vida junto,\r\n    en luz resplandeciente convertido,\r\n    verè distinto y junto\r\n    lo que es, y lo que ha sido,\r\n    y su principio propio y ascondido.\r\n        Entonces verè como\r\n    la soberana mano echò el cimiento\r\n    tan à nivel y plomo,\r\n    do estable y firme assiento\r\n    possee el pesadissimo elemento.\r\n        Verè las inmortales\r\n    colunas, do la tierra està fondada,\r\n    las lindes y señales\r\n    con que à la mar hinchada\r\n    la providencia tiene aprisionada.\r\n\r\n[235] The whole ode, which breathes a spirit of tender piety according\r\nto allegorical Christian ideas, well deserves to be once more\r\nre-printed:--\r\n\r\n        Alma region luciente,\r\n    prado de bien andança, que ni al hielo,\r\n    ni con el rayo ardiente\r\n    fallece, fertil suelo,\r\n    producidor eterno de consuelo.\r\n        De purpura y de nieve\r\n    florida la cabeça coronado,\r\n    à dulces pastos mueve\r\n    sin honda ni cayado\r\n    el buen pastor en ti su hato amado.\r\n        El va, y en pos dichosas\r\n    le siguen sus ovejas, do las pace\r\n    con inmortales rosas,\r\n    con flor que siempre nace,\r\n    y quanto mas se goza, mas renace.\r\n        Y dentro à la montaña\r\n    del alto bien las guia, ya en la vena\r\n    del gozo fiel las baña,\r\n    y les da mesa llena,\r\n    pastor y pasto el solo y suerte buena.\r\n        Y de su esfera quando\r\n    a cumbre toca altissimo subido\r\n    el Sol, el sesteando,\r\n    de su hato ceñido,\r\n    con dulce son deleyta el santo oido.\r\n        Toca el rabel sonoro,\r\n    y el inmortal dulçor al alma passa,\r\n    con que envilece el oro,\r\n    y ardiendo se traspassa,\r\n    y lança en aquel bien libre de tassa.\r\n        O son, ò voz si quiera\r\n    pequeña parte alguna decendiese\r\n    en mi sentido, y fuera\r\n    de si el alma pusiesse,\r\n    y toda en ti, ò amor, la convirtiese.\r\n        Conoceria donde\r\n    sesteas dulce esposo, y desatada\r\n    desta prision adonde\r\n    padece, à tu manada\r\n    vivirè junta, sin vagar errada.\r\n\r\n[236] These poems, by Luis de Leon, which up to a late period\r\nremained unknown, may be found in the fifth volume of the _Parnaso\r\nEspañol_. They are all on religious subjects. The longest is entitled,\r\n_Renunciacion al mundo, y conversion de un pecador_: and is probably\r\none of the earliest fruits of the youthful piety of the poet.\r\n\r\n[237] This observation occurs in the dedication to Pedro Portocarrero,\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\n[238] For example, the first eclogue:--\r\n\r\n    M. Tu Tityro à la sombra descansando\r\n       desta tendida haya, con la avena\r\n       el verso pastoril vas acordando.\r\n       Nosotros desterrados, tu sin pena\r\n       cantas de tu pastora alegre ocioso,\r\n       y tu pastora el valle y monte suena.\r\n\r\n    T. Pastor, este descanso tan dichoso\r\n       Dios me le concediò, que reputado\r\n       serà de mi por Dios aquel piadoso,\r\n           Y bañarà con sangre su sagrado\r\n       altar muy muchas veces el cordero\r\n       tierno, de mis ganados degollado,\r\n           Que por su beneficio soy vaquero,\r\n       y canto como ves pastorilmente\r\n       lo que me da contento, y lo que quiero; &c.\r\n\r\n[239] The ode _Integer vitæ scelerisque purus_ commences as follows in\r\nLuis de Leon’s translation:--\r\n\r\n        El hombre justo y bueno,\r\n    el que de culpa està y mancilla puro,\r\n    las manos en el seno,\r\n    sin dardo, ni zagaya va seguro,\r\n    y sin llevar cargada\r\n    la aljava de saeta enervolada.\r\n        O vaya por la arena\r\n    ardiente de la Libia ponçoñosa,\r\n    ò vaya por do suena\r\n    de Hidaspes la corriente fabulosa,\r\n    ò por la tierra cruda\r\n    de nieve llena y de piedad desnuda.\r\n        De mi se que al encuentro,\r\n    mientras por la montaña vagueando\r\n    mas de lo justo entro\r\n    sin armas, y de Lalage cantando,\r\n    me vido, y mas ligero\r\n    que rayo huyò un lobo carnicero.\r\n\r\n[240]\r\n\r\n    El agua es bien precioso,\r\n    y entre el rico tesoro,\r\n    como el ardiente fuego en noche escura,\r\n    ansi relumbra el oro.\r\n    Mas, alma, si es sabroso\r\n    cantar de las contiendas la ventura\r\n    ansi como en la altura\r\n    no ay rayo mas luciente\r\n    que el Sol, que Rey del dia\r\n    por todo el yermo cielo se demuestra:\r\n    ansi es mas excelente\r\n    la Olimpica porfia\r\n    de todas las que canta la vos nuestra,\r\n    materia abundante,\r\n    donde todo elegante\r\n    ingenio alça la voz ora cantando\r\n    de Rea y de Saturno el engendrado,\r\n    y juntamente entrando\r\n    al techo de Hieron alto preciado.\r\n        Hieron el que mantiene\r\n    el cetro merecido\r\n    del abundoso cielo Siciliano,\r\n    y dentro en si cogido\r\n    lo bueno y la flor tiene\r\n    de quanto valor cabe en pecho humano:\r\n    y con maestra mano\r\n    discanta señalado\r\n    en la mas dulce parte\r\n    del canto, la que infunde mas contento,\r\n    y en el banquete amado\r\n    mayor dulçor reparte.\r\n    Mas toma ya el laud, si el sentimiento\r\n    con dulces fantasias\r\n    te colma y alegrias\r\n    la gracia de Phernico, el que en Alfeo\r\n    bolando sin espuela en la carrera,\r\n    y venciendo el deseo\r\n    del amo, le cobró la voz primera, &c.\r\n\r\n[241] These sermons are highly eulogized by Mayans y Siscar in the\r\n_Oracion en que se exhorta a seguir la verdadera idea de la eloquencia\r\nEspañola_; if indeed Mayans really be the author of that discourse. It\r\nis contained in the first volume of the _Origenes de la lengua Esp._ p.\r\n199.\r\n\r\n[242] There is a copy of the second edition of Luis de Leon’s _Perfecta\r\nCasada_, printed at Salamanca in 1586, in quarto, in the library of the\r\nuniversity of Göttingen.\r\n\r\n[243] Velasquez passes him over in silence. The _Parnaso Español_, tom.\r\nii. contains some specimens of his poetry, together with a notice of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n[244] The commencement of one of his elegies may serve as a specimen.\r\n\r\n        A la sazon que se nos muestra llena\r\n    la tierra de cien mil varias colores,\r\n    y comienza su llanto Filomena:\r\n        Quando partido Amor en mil amores\r\n    produce en todo corazon humano\r\n    como en la tierra el tiempo nuevas flores:\r\n        Al pie de un monte, en un florido llano,\r\n    a sombra de una haya en la verdura,\r\n    cataba triste su dolor Silvano:\r\n        Y asegundaba voz en su tristura\r\n    el agua que bajaba con sonido\r\n    de una fuente que nace en el altura:\r\n        Pastor en todo el valle conocido,\r\n    a quien la Musa pastoral ha dado\r\n    un estilo en cantar dulce y subido. &c.\r\n\r\n[245] For example:--\r\n\r\n        Si Apolo tanta gracia\r\n    en mi rustica citara pusiese\r\n    como en la del de Tracia,\r\n    y quando se moviese,\r\n    desde el un Polo al otra el són se oyese,\r\n        Y a los desiertos frios\r\n    pudiese dar calor, y refrenáse\r\n    el curso de los rios,\r\n    las piedras levantáse,\r\n    y tras el dulce canto las lleváse,\r\n        Jamás le ocuparia\r\n    en claros hechos de la antigua historia,\r\n    mas solo cantarìa\r\n    para inmortal memoria\r\n    el tiempo de mi pena, y de mi gloria. &c.\r\n\r\n[246] Some of Gutierre de Cetina’s poems have been printed from\r\nmanuscript by Sedano, in his _Parnaso Español_, vols. vii. viii. and\r\nix. together with a short biographical notice of the author.\r\n\r\n[247] The following is an anacreontic song by this author:--\r\n\r\n        De tus rubios cabellos,\r\n    Dorida ingrata mia,\r\n    hizo el amor la cuerda\r\n    para el arco homicida.\r\n        A hora veras sí burlas\r\n    de mi poder, decia:\r\n    y tomando un flecha\r\n    quiso a mì dirigirla.\r\n        Yo le dije: muchacho\r\n    arco y harpon retira:\r\n    con esas nuevas armas,\r\n    quién hay que te resista?\r\n\r\n[248] The following is one of them:--\r\n\r\n        Ojos claros serenos,\r\n    si de dulce mirar sois alabados,\r\n    por qué si me mirais, mirais ayrados?\r\n    Si quanto mas piadosos,\r\n    mas bellos pareceis a quien os mira,\r\n    por qué a mí solo me mirais con ira?\r\n    Ojos claros serenos,\r\n    ya que asi me mirais, miradme al menos.\r\n\r\n[249] The following stanza is from a cancione on his mistress’s hair.\r\nThe lady’s tresses must have been of a very fiery red.\r\n\r\n    En la _esfera del fuego_\r\n    de su calor mas fuerte\r\n    de tus cabellos fue el color sacado,\r\n    _cuya calidad luego\r\n    dió nuevas de mi muerte\r\n    al yelo_ que _en tu pecho_ está encerrado;\r\n    a si será forzado,\r\n    entre contrarios puesto\r\n    que mi vivir se acabe,\r\n    porque en razon no cabe\r\n    sufrir tanta crueldad quien vió tu gesto,\r\n    si hay _fuego y hielo_ entre ellos,\r\n    quién se guardará de ellos?\r\n\r\n[250] The fourth volume of the _Parnaso Español_ contains a long\r\neclogue by Pedro de Padilla.\r\n\r\n[251] Bibliographic notices of the works of Padilla, may be found in\r\nDieze’s Remarks on Velasquez, p. 194.\r\n\r\n[252] Cervantes in the condemnation of the library of Don Quixote,\r\nexempts Gil Polo’s _Diana enamorada_, adding, that the book ought to be\r\nas much respected, “as though Apollo himself had written it.”\r\n\r\n[253] For instance, in the following:--\r\n\r\n    No es ciego Amor, mas yo lo soy, que guio\r\n        mi voluntad camino del tormento:\r\n        no es niño Amor: mas yo que en un momento\r\n        espero y tengo miedo, lloro y rio.\r\n    Nombrar llamas de Amor es desvario,\r\n        su fuego es el ardiente y vivo intento,\r\n        sus alas son mi altivo pensamiento,\r\n        y la esperanza vana en que mi fio.\r\n    No tiene Amor cadenas, ni saëtas,\r\n        para prender y herir libres y sanos,\r\n        que en él no hay mas poder del que le damos.\r\n    Porque es Amor mentira de poetas,\r\n        sueño de locos, idolo de vanos:\r\n        mirad qué negro Dios el que adoramos.\r\n\r\n[254] The following stanzas will afford an adequate idea of the\r\ncolloquial song to which they belong, and which presents equal beauty\r\nthroughout:--\r\n\r\n        _Alcida._\r\n    Mientras el Sol sus rayos muy ardientes\r\n        con tal furia y rigor al mundo envia,\r\n        que de Nymphas la casta compañia\r\n        por los sombrios mora, y por las fuentes:\r\n    Y la cigarra el canto replicando,\r\n        se està quejando,\r\n        pastora canta,\r\n        con gracia tanta,\r\n        que enternescido\r\n        de haverte oído,\r\n        al poderoso cielo de su grado\r\n        fresco liquor envie al seco prado.\r\n            _Diana._\r\n    Mientras está el mayor de los planetas\r\n        en medio del oriente y del ocaso,\r\n        y al labrador en descubierto raso\r\n        mas rigurosas tira sus saëtas:\r\n    Al dulce murmurar de la corriente\r\n        de aquesta fuente\r\n        mueve tal canto,\r\n        que cause espanto,\r\n        y de contentos\r\n        los bravos vientos\r\n        el impetu furioso refrenando,\r\n        vengan con manso espiritu soplando.\r\n\r\n[255] The following is a specimen of _rimas Franceses_ by Gil Polo:--\r\n\r\n    De flores matizadas se vista el verde prado,\r\n        retumbe el hueco bosque de voces deleytosas,\r\n        olor tengan mas fino las coloradas rosas,\r\n        floridos ramos mueva el viento sossegado.\r\n    El rio apressurado\r\n        sus aguas acresciente,\r\n        y pues tan libre queda la fatigada gente\r\n        del congojoso llanto,\r\n        moved, hermosas Nymphas, regocijado canto.\r\n\r\n[256] The following is by no means the worst of these enigmas.\r\n\r\n    Vide un soto levantado\r\n        sobre los aynes un dia,\r\n        el qual con sangre regado,\r\n        con gran ansia cultivado,\r\n        Muchas hierbas producia.\r\n    De alli un manojo arrancando,\r\n        y solo con él tocando\r\n        una sàbia y cuerda gente,\r\n        la dejé cabe una puente\r\n        sin dolores lamentando.\r\n\r\nWho would guess that the object alluded to is a _horse’s tail_?\r\n\r\n[257] A new and elegant edition of Gaspar Gil Polo’s _Diana enamorada_,\r\nenriched with a copious Commentary on the _Canto de Turia_, appeared at\r\nMadrid in 1778.\r\n\r\n[258] See Dieze’s edition of Velasquez, p. 419. The chapter on the\r\nidyl is totally distinct from that which treats of the eclogues of the\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\n[259] See my History of Italian Literature, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[260] Dieze in his Remarks on Velasquez, p. 381, gives bibliographic\r\nnotices of these, and of other epic productions of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n[261] The title is rather curious:--_Del Metamorphoseos de Ovidio,\r\notava rima, traducido por Felipe Mey, &c. Con otras cosas del mesmo._\r\nTarragona, 1586, in 8vo.\r\n\r\n[262] Further particulars relative to the history of these\r\ntranslations, may be found in Dieze’s Remarks on Velasquez, p. 198, &c.\r\n\r\n[263] Among others Velasquez.\r\n\r\n[264] For example:--\r\n\r\n    Pues la santa Inquisicion\r\n        suele ser tan diligente,\r\n        en castigar con razon\r\n        qualquier secta y opinion\r\n        levantada nuevamente;\r\n        Resucitese luzero,\r\n        a castigar en España\r\n        una muy nueva y estraña,\r\n        como aquella de Lutero\r\n        en las partes de Alemaña.\r\n    Bien se pueden castigar\r\n        a cuenta de Anabaptistas,\r\n        pues por ley particular\r\n        se tornan a baptizar,\r\n        y se llaman Petrarquistas.\r\n        Han renegado la fè\r\n        de las trobas Castellanas,\r\n        y tras las Italianas\r\n        se pierden, diziendo, que\r\n        son mas ricas y galanas.\r\n\r\n[265] On this subject he says:--\r\n\r\n    Coplas dulces plazenteras,\r\n        no pecan en liviandad,\r\n        pero pierde autoridad,\r\n        quien las escrive de veras.\r\n        Y entremete,\r\n        el seso por alcahuete,\r\n        en los mysterios de amor\r\n        quanto mas si el trobador,\r\n        passa ya del cavallete.\r\n    Y algunos ay, yo lo se,\r\n        que hazen obras fundadas\r\n        de coplas enamoradas,\r\n        sin tener causa porque.\r\n        Y esto està\r\n        en costumbre tanto ya,\r\n        que muchos escriven penas,\r\n        por remedas las agenas,\r\n        sin saber quien se las da.\r\n\r\n[266] The following, which is one of his most successful productions,\r\nmust be transcribed at length, since the beauty of any detached passage\r\nwould suffer from want of connection.\r\n\r\n    Por unas huertas hermosas,\r\n        vagando muy linda Lida\r\n        texio de lyrios y rosas\r\n        blancas, frescas, y olorosas,\r\n        una guirnalda florida.\r\n        Y andando en esta labor,\r\n        viendo a deshora al Amor\r\n        en las rosas escondido,\r\n        con las que ella avia texido,\r\n        le prendio como a traydor.\r\n    El muchacho no domado\r\n        que nunca penso prenderse,\r\n        viendose preso y atado,\r\n        al principio muy ayrado,\r\n        pugnava por defenderse.\r\n        Y en sus alas estrivando\r\n        forcejava peleando,\r\n        y tentava (aunque desnudo,)\r\n        de desatarse del ñudo\r\n        para valerse bolando.\r\n    Pero viendo la blancura\r\n        que sus tetas descubrian,\r\n        como leche fresca y pura,\r\n        que a su madre en hermosura\r\n        ventaja no conocian,\r\n        y su rostro, que encender\r\n        era bastante, y mover\r\n        (con su mucha loçania)\r\n        los mismos Dioses; pedia\r\n        para dexarse vencer.\r\n    Buelto a Venus, a la hora\r\n        hablandole desde alli,\r\n        dixo, madre, Emperadora,\r\n        desde oy mas, busca señora\r\n        un nuevo Amor para ti.\r\n        Y esta nueva, con oylla,\r\n        no te mueva, o de manzilla,\r\n        que aviendo yo de reynar,\r\n        este es el proprio lugar,\r\n        en que se ponga mi silla.\r\n\r\n[267] I have before me the same copy of which Dieze in his Remarks on\r\nVelasquez, p. 197, gives a bibliographic description. This copy, which\r\ndid not pass the censorship of the Inquisition, is remarkable for a\r\ntrick of the bookseller, who has affixed to it a title-page without a\r\ndate, and at the end two leaves with a false privilege.\r\n\r\n[268] For instance, one to Doña Ana de Xomburg begins thus:--\r\n\r\n    Vuestros lindos ojos Ana\r\n        quien me dexasse gozallos,\r\n        y tantas vezes besallos\r\n        quantas me pide la gana,\r\n        con que vivo de mirallos;\r\n        Darles ìa\r\n        cien mil besos cada dia,\r\n        y aunque fuessen un millon,\r\n        mi penado coraçon\r\n        nunca harto se veria.\r\n    O quan bien aventurado\r\n        es aquel que puede estar,\r\n        do os pueda ver y hablar\r\n        sin perderse de turbado,\r\n        como yo suelo quedar.\r\n        Ay de mi,\r\n        que ante vos despues que os ví,\r\n        y quedè de vos herido,\r\n        no ay en mi ningun sentido\r\n        que sepa parte de si.\r\n\r\n[269] The song addressed to Ana de Xomburg, quoted above, ends with a\r\nburlesque joke:--\r\n\r\n    Si  segun lo que padezco\r\n        pudiendolo yo dezir,\r\n        merced os he de pedir,\r\n        mucho mayor la merezo,\r\n        que la puedo recebir.\r\n        Mas no pido\r\n        pago tan descomedido,\r\n        que es demandar gollorias,\r\n        porquè no dire en mis dias\r\n        lo que esta noche he sufrido.\r\n    No  quiero que hagays nada,\r\n        sino que solo querays;\r\n        que si vos aqui llegays,\r\n        yo doy fin a la jornada\r\n        donde vos la començays.\r\n        Y os espero,\r\n        porque llegando primero\r\n        de vos aveys de llegar,\r\n        vamos despues a la par,\r\n        que es trabajo plazentero.\r\n\r\n[270] The following is on the indisposition of a mistress:--\r\n\r\n    Ese mal que da tormento\r\n        a vuessa merced señora\r\n        en vos tiene el aposento,\r\n        mas yo soy el que lo siento,\r\n        y mi alma quien lo llora.\r\n        Y de pura compassion\r\n        de veros sin alegria,\r\n        se me quiebra el coraçon,\r\n        vos sentis vuestra passion,\r\n        mas yo la vuestra y la mia.\r\n\r\n[271] In the original this Spanish Ranz de Vache is uncommonly simple\r\nand pretty:--\r\n\r\n    Guardame las vacas,\r\n    Carillejo, y besarte he;\r\n    Sino, besame tu a mi,\r\n    Que yo te las guardarè.\r\n\r\n[272] A predisposition to yield to temptation, is thus attributed to\r\nEve:--\r\n\r\n    _Alle._ Ella fue consentidora,\r\n            y cobrò subitamente\r\n            mal siniestro,\r\n            para mal y daño nuestro:\r\n            y pues fraude entre ellos uvo,\r\n            que se espera de quien tuvo\r\n            al diablo por maestro.\r\n\r\n    _Fil._  Si el callara\r\n            ella nunca le buscara.\r\n\r\n    _Alle._ Puede ser, mas si el no viera\r\n            primero quien ella era,\r\n            por dicha no la tentara\r\n            para mal.\r\n            Y pues era el principal\r\n            Adam en aquel vergel,\r\n            porque no le tentò a el?\r\n            sino por verle leal\r\n            y constante.\r\n\r\n[273] The following lines afford a fair specimen of the style of the\r\nwhole dialogue.\r\n\r\n    _Fil._  Quando Dios lo criò todo,\r\n            y formò el hombre primero,\r\n            ya veys que como a grossero\r\n            lo hizo de puro lodo.\r\n            Mas a Eva,\r\n            para testimonio y prueva,\r\n            que devemos preferilla,\r\n            sacola de la costilla\r\n            por obra sutil y nueva.\r\n            Y mandò\r\n            que el hombre que assi criò,\r\n            padre y madre dexasse,\r\n            y a la muger se juntasse,\r\n            que por consorte le dio\r\n            singular,\r\n            mandandosela guardar\r\n            como a su propria persona,\r\n            por espejo y por corona\r\n            en que se deve mirar.\r\n\r\n[274] The following passage from a satire on _Court Life_, is tolerably\r\ncharacteristic of Castillejo’s whole course of thought in works of this\r\nkind:--\r\n\r\n    La quarta gente granada\r\n        que navegan con buen norte,\r\n        a quien es licencia dada\r\n        de la vivienda en la Corte.\r\n        Son aquellos\r\n        que la mandan, y en pos de ellos\r\n        se va la gente goloca,\r\n        y algunos por los cabellos,\r\n        aunque muestran otra cosa.\r\n        Estos son,\r\n        los que en la governacion\r\n        tienen poder, y con ello\r\n        harto cuydado y passion,\r\n        pero al fin, con padecello\r\n        se enriquecen:\r\n        estos son los que parecen\r\n        al mundo cosa divina,\r\n        y les sirven y obedecen,\r\n        con diligencia contina,\r\n        muy crecida.\r\n\r\n[275] See page 131.\r\n\r\n[276] The only unadulterated source from which all authors have\r\nhitherto derived their information relative to the earliest history\r\nof the Spanish drama, is Cervantes’s well known preface to his _Ocho\r\nComedias y Entremeses_, an edition of which was published in two vols.\r\nquarto, by Blas Nasarre, at Madrid, in 1749. To this may be added the\r\npreface of the editor, Blas Nasarre, though it is but of secondary\r\nvalue, and has given occasion to singular mistakes. The article\r\n_Comödie_, in Blankenburg’s appendix to Sulzer’s dictionary, though\r\nrather obscure, communicates some useful facts.\r\n\r\n[277] Velasquez, in his History of Spanish Poetry, alludes but very\r\ndistantly to the heterogeneous nature of the Spanish dramas; and Dieze\r\nis not more satisfactory in his Remarks. What is contained in Flögel’s\r\nHistory of Comic Literature, vol. iv. respecting the origin of the\r\nSpanish drama, is copied from Velasquez and other modern writers.\r\nSignorelli has more novelty of information in his _Storia Critica de\r\nTeatri_, vol. iv. but he confounds the notices one with another, and\r\nreasons on the Spanish drama merely as a moral critic.\r\n\r\n[278] This translation, which is only remarkable on account of the\r\nreputation of its author, may be found in the _Obras del Maestro Perez\r\nde Oliva_, Cordova, 1586, in 4to.\r\n\r\n[279] Velasquez and Dieze, p. 315, give further notices of these\r\ntranslations.\r\n\r\n[280] See page 132.\r\n\r\n[281] _Tragedia Policiana, en que se tratan los amores--executadas\r\npor la industria de la diabolica Vieja Claudina, &c._ The title is a\r\nsufficient specimen of the work. See Velasquez and Dieze, p. 312.\r\n\r\n[282] Dieze in his Remarks on Velasquez, gives a further account of\r\nthese works. He also notices a second Cœlestina, (_Segunda Comedia de\r\nCelestina_.)\r\n\r\n[283] These writers are Nicolas Antonio, and Blas Nasarre, the editor\r\nof the comedies of Cervantes.\r\n\r\n[284] This collection of the plays and other poems of Naharro is\r\nmentioned by Nicolas Antonio, and also by Dieze. I have never seen it:\r\nand in the numerous collections of Spanish dramas by various authors,\r\nwith which I am acquainted, I have sought in vain for the productions\r\nof Naharro. Blankenburg speaks of them as if he had read them; and\r\nSignorelli expressly says, that he has perused them all. Among the\r\npassages quoted by the latter, in order to justify the contemptuous\r\ntone in which he criticises the writings of Naharro, is a line of\r\ncorrupt Portuguese. May not this be Galician? The modern comic writers\r\nof Spain occasionally make their clowns converse in the Galician\r\ndialect.\r\n\r\n[285] Cervantes attributes to himself the invention of dividing a drama\r\ninto three _jornadas_. How happens this? Cervantes was a vain man,\r\nbut not an empty boaster. He seems to have been totally unacquainted\r\nwith the dramas of Naharro, but he might have heard of the division of\r\nplays into three _jornadas_, without retaining a distinct recollection\r\nof the fact. In this way his memory may have deceived him, when he\r\nsupposed that the division originated with himself. And yet it is\r\nsingular enough that in his Galathea, he mentions, among other poets,\r\nthe _artificioso Torres Naharro_.\r\n\r\n[286] Concerning these collections, see Dieze’s Remarks on Velasquez,\r\np. 316. I am acquainted with only two:--one is entitled, _Los Coloquios\r\nPastoriles de muy agraziada y apacible prosa, &c. por el excellente\r\npoeta, y gracioso representante Lope de Rueda, sacados a luz por Juan\r\nTimoneda; Sevilla_ 1576, in small octavo, printed in gothic characters.\r\nThe other is entitled: _Las segundas dos Comedias de Rueda_, without\r\ndate, but printed in the same type and form as the first mentioned\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n[287] The following specimen of the dialogue of these comedies is from\r\na scene in which a clown quarrels with his wife:--\r\n\r\n    _Gine._ Aun teneis lengua para hablar, anima de cantaro?\r\n\r\n    _Pablo._ Dote al diabro muger, no ternas un poco de miramiento.\r\n    Si quiera por las barbas de la merced que esta delante.\r\n\r\n    _Gine._ He callad anima de campana.\r\n\r\n    _Pab._ Que es anima de campana, muger?\r\n\r\n    _Gine._ Que? badajo como vos.\r\n\r\n    _Pab._ Badajo a vuestro marido? deme essegar rote vuessa merced.\r\n\r\n    _Gine._ Assi, garrote para mi, al fin no seriades vos hijo de\r\n    Guarniço el enxalmador, cura bestias.\r\n\r\n    _Pab._ Y parescete a ti mal, porque sea hijo de bendicion.\r\n\r\n    _Camilo._ Ay amarga, y como hijo de bendicion? &c.\r\n\r\n[288] The emphatic praises of the publisher of the _Parnaso Español_,\r\nrepresent Juan de la Cueva as a poet of the first rank. See the\r\nliterary notices prefixed to the eighth volume of that collection. The\r\nworks of Cueva are there mentioned with the dates of their various\r\neditions.

The former, however, appears to\r\nbe the more appropriate title, since the author doubtless wrote it in\r\nhis old age. It has been drawn from the obscurity in which it ought to\r\nhave remained, and printed in the eighth vol. of the Parnaso Español.\r\nBermudez, in an affected strain of language, and with true Dominican\r\nfanaticism, extols the monstrous barbarity with which the great Duke\r\nof Alba persecuted the heretics of the Netherlands, and made “the cold\r\nnorthern waters flow the more fiercely from the infusion of warm blood.”\r\n\r\n[298] Under these titles they are reprinted in the _Parnaso Español_,\r\nvol. vi.\r\n\r\n[299] It commences in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n    Otro cielo, otro sol, me parece este,\r\n    del que gozava yo sereno, y claro,\r\n    alla de donde vengo, ay triste cielo,\r\n    como en ti veo el tranze de mis hados.\r\n    Ay que donde no veo aquellos ojos,\r\n    que alumbran estos mios, quanto veo\r\n    me pone horror, y grima, y se me antoja.\r\n    Mas triste que la noche, y mas escuro,\r\n    alla (ay dolor) los dexo alla en Coymbra\r\n    tierra donde parò la hedad dorada,\r\n    ò que no es tierra aquella, parayso\r\n    la llamo de deleytes y frescuras.\r\n    Alli tan claro es todo que aun la noche\r\n    mas dia me parescè que de dia,\r\n    alli es esmalte del florido suelo,\r\n    mas que estrellado cielo representa;\r\n    alli el concento de las avezillas,\r\n    es un reclame dulze de las almas.\r\n\r\n[300] A few lines of this scene will serve to shew how Bermudez has\r\nimitated the dialogic antitheses of the Greek tragedy.\r\n\r\n    _In._ Adonde huyre porque me dexen?\r\n\r\n    _Se._ Huyr auras de ti por tu remedio.\r\n\r\n    _In._ Ya no me vale hazer lo que no puedo.\r\n\r\n    _Se._ Tu mismo te pusiste en tal flaqueza.\r\n\r\n    _In._ No puedo, ni querria arrepentirme.\r\n\r\n    _Se._ Con essa voluntad el yerro cresce.\r\n\r\n    _In._ Si es yerro como dizes, otros uvo.\r\n\r\n    _Se._ Uno, mas toda via fueron yerros.\r\n\r\n[301] Here the chorus, like the other characters of the play, speaks in\r\niambics; for example:--\r\n\r\n    _Doña Ines._            Que dizes? Habla!\r\n\r\n    _Cho._ No puedo; lloro.\r\n\r\n    _Do._                   De que lloras?\r\n\r\n    _Cho._ Veo, esse rostro, y sos ojos, esa.\r\n\r\n    _D._                                       trista:\r\n         triste de mi que mal, que mal tamaño,\r\n         es ese que me traes.\r\n\r\n    _Cho._                       Mal de muerte:\r\n\r\n    _D._ Mal grande.\r\n\r\n    _C._             todo tuyo.\r\n\r\n    _D._                        que me dizes\r\n         es muerto mi Señor, infante mio?\r\n\r\n    _Cho._ Los dos morireys presto.\r\n\r\n    _D._                            ò nuevas tristes!\r\n         Como, porque razon, que me le matan? &c.\r\n\r\n[302] Only the latter part of this scene can conveniently be\r\ntranscribed here. Ines speaks:--\r\n\r\n    Tapiceria triste,\r\n    yrase donde yo me paseava,\r\n    no me vera, no me hallara en el campo,\r\n    no en el jardin, ni camara; hele muerto.\r\n    Ay veote morir mi bien por mi,\r\n    mi bien ya que yo muero vive tu,\r\n    esto te pido y ruego, vive, vive,\r\n    ampara estos tus hijos tan queridos,\r\n    y esta mi muerte pague los desastres\r\n    que a ellos esperavan. Rey señor,\r\n    pues puedes socorrer a males tantos\r\n    socorreme, perdoname. No puedo,\r\n    no puedo mas dezirte:\r\n    Señor por que me matas?\r\n    en que te lo merezco?\r\n    ay, no me mates, ay!\r\n    Jesus, Maria!\r\n\r\n[303] _Libro de caballeria celestial del pie de la rosa fragrante,\r\n&c. por D. Geronymo de Sanpedro. Anvers, 1554, in 8vo._ The Gottingen\r\nuniversity possesses a copy of this book.\r\n\r\n[304] This phrase occurs in a preface which Venegas wrote to a moral\r\nallegorical novel by Luis Mexia, which will hereafter be noticed.\r\n\r\n[305] I have seen only the _Primera_ parte de las Patrañas de Juan\r\nTimoneda, Sevilla, 1583, in 8vo.\r\n\r\n[306] See Nicolas Antonio, article Alfonso de Ulloa.\r\n\r\n[307] Nicolas Antonio does not mention the date of either his birth\r\nor death. More precise information respecting him may be found in the\r\nsixth vol. of the _Parnaso Español_.\r\n\r\n[308] See p. 280.\r\n\r\n[309] This dialogue, with the continuation by Ambrosio de Morales, and\r\nother works of a similar kind, have been elegantly printed under the\r\ngeneral title of _Obras, que Cervantes de Salazar ha hecho, glosado y\r\ntraducido_, &c. Madrid, 1772, in 4to.\r\n\r\n[310] For example:--\r\n\r\n_Aur._ Bien veo, Antonio, que ai essos provechos que dices de la\r\nsoledad: pero yo tengo creido, que otra causa mayor ai. _Ant._ Que\r\ncausa puede aver mayor? _Aur._ El aborrecimento, que cada hombre tiene\r\nal genero humano, por el qual somos inclinados a apartarnos unos de\r\notros. _Ant._ Tan aborrecibles te parecen los hombres, que aun ellos\r\nmesmos por huir de sì, busquen la soledad? _Aur._ Pareceme tanto, que\r\ncada vez que me acuerdo, que soi hombre, querria, o no aver sido,\r\no no tener sentimiento dello. _Ant._ Maravillome, Aurelio, que los\r\nautores excelentes, que acostumbras a leer, i los sabios hombres, que\r\nconversas, no te ayan quitado de esse error.\r\n\r\n[311] As for instance in the annexed passage:--\r\n\r\nAssi que todos estos i los demas estados de los hombres no son sino\r\ndiversos modos de penar, do ningun descanso tienen, ni seguridad en\r\nalguno dellos: porque la fortuna todos los confunde, i los revuelve con\r\nvanas esperanzas i vanos semblantes de honras i riquezas, en las quales\r\ncosas mostrando quan facil es i quan incierta, a todos mete en desseos\r\nde valer, tan desordenados, que no ai lugar tan alto, do los queramos\r\ndejar. Con estos escarnios de fortuna cada uno aborrece su estado con\r\ncodicia de los otros; do si llega, no halla aquel reposo que pensaba.\r\nPorque todos los bienes de fortuna al dessear parecen hermosos, i al\r\ngozar llenos de pena.\r\n\r\n[312] For example the conclusion of the discourse of Aurelio, who,\r\nit is true, describes rather than censures the dark side of human\r\nsociety:--\r\n\r\nTodo esto se va en humo, hasta que tornan los hombres a estar en tanto\r\nolvido, como antes que naciessen: i la misma vanidad se sigue despues,\r\nque primero avia. Hasta aquí, Dinarco, me ha parecido decir del hombre:\r\nagora yo lo dejo él i su fama enterrados en olvido perdurable: i no\r\nsé con que razones tu, Antonio, podrás resucitarlo. Dale vida, si\r\npudieres, i consuelo contra tantos males, como has oido: que si tu assi\r\nlo hicieres, yo seré vencido de buena gana, pues tu vitoria será gloria\r\npara mi, que me veré constituido en mas excelente estado, que pensava.\r\n\r\n[313] Only this treatise of Morales _Sobre la lengua Castellana_, is\r\nreprinted in the collection mentioned in note, page 309.\r\n\r\n[314] The following passage from the treatise on the Spanish language,\r\nforms an addition to the history of rhetorical cultivation of prose\r\nrhetoric among the Spaniards in the age of Morales:--\r\n\r\nPara que pues era este cuidado? de que servia esta diligencia entre\r\ngente tan prudente i de tanto miramiento, si naturaleza lo suplia, i\r\navia ella de hazerlo mejor? Veían sin duda, como sin tales exemplos no\r\nse podia perfeccionar el uso della lengua en aquella parte, i que a\r\nfaltar lo que proveian, faltaria el bien que deseavan: i lo mismo es\r\nen las formas i maneras particulares de hablar, que llaman _phrasis_,\r\ni en todas las otras partes del lenguage, donde ayudada naturaleza\r\ncon el mejor uso, saca mas ventaja i perfeccion. Pues qué los otros,\r\nque todo lo tienen en Castellano por afectado? estos quieren condenar\r\nnuestra lengua a un estraño abatimiento, i como enterrarla viva, donde\r\nmiserablemente se corrompa i pierda todo su lustre, su lindeza i\r\nhermosura: o desconfian, que no es para parecer, i esta es ignorancia;\r\no no la quieren adornar como deven, i esta es maldad. _Yo no digo que\r\nafeites nuestra lengua Castellana, sino que le laves la cara._ No le\r\npintes el rostro, mas quitale la suciedad: no la vistas de bordados,\r\nrecamos, mas no le niegues un buen atavio de vestido, que aderece con\r\ngravedad.\r\n\r\n[315] Fourteen of the discourses of Morales, form an appendix to his\r\nedition of the Obras de Perez de Oliva, already mentioned.\r\n\r\n[316] This treatise also forms an appendix to the collection\r\nbefore-mentioned.\r\n\r\n[317] Hence the title: _Obras_ que Francisco Cervantes de Salazar ha\r\n_hecho_, _glosado_, y _traducido_. See note, p. 309.\r\n\r\n[318] As a useful moral book, this romance is, perhaps, worthy of being\r\ntranslated or new modelled. Tasteless morality is, to be sure, no more\r\ncommendable in literature than tasteful immorality; and any attempt to\r\nrevive the fashion of moral allegories would deserve condemnation. But\r\na work like the allegorical romance of Mexia, might probably possess\r\nmore value than many of our modern tales for youth.\r\n\r\n[319] Los cinco libro primeros de la Coronica General de España,\r\nrecopilava el Maestro Florian de Ocampo, &c. Alcalà, 1578, in folio.\r\nThis is the first, and, perhaps, the only edition of the work.\r\n\r\n[320] Mi principal intencion, he says, ha seido, contar la verdad\r\nentera y sencilla, _sin que en ella aya engaño ni cosa que le\r\nadorne_--sin envolver en ella las _rhetoricas y vanidades, que por\r\notros libros deste nuestro tiempo se ponen_.\r\n\r\n[321] This is the Coronica General de España por Don Ambrosio de\r\nMorales; Alcalà de Henàres, 1574, in folio.\r\n\r\n[322] See my History of Italian Literature, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[323] _Anales de la corona de Aragon, Caragoça_, 1616, six vols. small\r\nfolio. This work was not printed till after the death of Philip II. The\r\ntwo last volumes contain the history of foreign affairs in the reign of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella.\r\n\r\n[324] He says:--\r\n\r\nEsta fue muy acatada entre todas gentes, porque siempre convino tener\r\npresente lo passado, y considerar con quanta constancia se deve\r\nfundar una perpetua paz y concordia civil, pues _no se puede ofrecer\r\nmayor peligro, que la mudança de los estados en la declinacion de\r\nlos tiempos_. Teniendo cuenta con esto, siendo todos los sucesos tan\r\ninciertos a todos, y sabiendo quan pequeñas ocasiones suelen ser\r\ncausa de grandes mudanças, el conocimiento de _las cosas passadas nos\r\nenseñara, que tengamos por mas dichoso y bienaventurado el estado\r\npresente_: y que estemos siempre con recelo del que està por venir.\r\n\r\n[325] The following observations, concerning the conduct of professors\r\nof moral philosophy, may serve as a specimen of Pedro de Oliva’s\r\neloquence:--\r\n\r\nYo en contrario dello no dire de mi lastimas ningunas, porque no lo\r\nacostumbro en tales casos. Pero si la cathedra de philosophia moral\r\nsupiesse hablar, que lastimas piensan vuestras mercedes que diria? Ella\r\npor si diria, que miren quan olvidada ha estado, y quan escureceda,\r\nmuchas vezes por passiones de los que la han proveydo, y que miren, que\r\nagora la demandan unos llorando, y otros no se en que confiando; y que\r\nunos la quieren, para cumplir sus necessidades, y otros para cumplir\r\nlas agenas: no siendo aquesto lo que ella ha menester. Porque ella\r\ndemanda hombre, que en las adversidades no gima, ni en los casos de\r\njusticia solicite.\r\n\r\n[326] As Philip II. is but little known in the character of a letter\r\nwriter, it may not be improper to quote a passage which reflects honour\r\non him as a man:--\r\n\r\nLa verdad, i cumplimiento de lo que se dice, i promete, es el\r\nfundamento del credito, i estimacion de los hombres, i sobre que\r\nestriva, i se funda el trato comun, i confianza. Esto se requiere, i es\r\nmucho mas necessario en los mui principales, i que tienen grandes, i\r\npublicos cargos; porque de su verdad, i cumplimiento depende la Fé, i\r\nseguridad publica. Encargoos mucho, que tengais en esto gran cuenta, i\r\ncuidado; i se entienda, i conozca en Vos en todas partes, i ocasiones,\r\nel credito, que pueden, i deven tener de lo que digeredes: que demàs\r\nde lo que toca a las cosas publicas, i de vuestro cargo, importa èsto\r\nmucho a vuestro particular honor i estimacion.\r\n\r\n[327] This collection is entitled: _Cartas morales, militares, civiles\r\ny literarias de varios autores Españoles, recogidos, &c. por D.\r\nGregorio Mayans y Siscar_, 1734, in 8vo. Most of these letters are\r\nproductions of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n[328] See page 265. The title-page of this book, which runs as\r\nfollows--_Philosophia Antigua Poetica, del Doctor Alonzo Lopez\r\nPinciano, Medico Cesareo, dirigida al Conde Joannes Kevenhiler_\r\n(Khevenhüller), &c.--also contains a full detail of the titles of the\r\nCount to whom it is dedicated. It was printed at Madrid, 1596, in\r\nquarto.\r\n\r\n[329] Velasquez and Dieze, p. 505, furnish bibliographic notices of the\r\nworks of these authors. See also Blankenburgh on the same subject.\r\n\r\n[330] Cervantes spent that portion of his life, during which his name\r\nis particularly conspicuous, among Spanish poets, so remote from\r\nliterary society, that at his death sufficient notices did not exist\r\nto form a complete narrative of his life. The well known biography by\r\nMayans y Siscar, which was not written till the eighteenth century,\r\ndeserved to be valued only for want of a better. It is prefixed to many\r\neditions of Don Quixote. The preference, however, must be given to the\r\nmore recent life of Cervantes, by Don Vicente de los Rios, which is\r\nprefixed to the splendid edition of Don Quixote, published at Madrid,\r\n1781, in royal quarto.\r\n\r\n[331] In his Viage al Parnaso, chap. iv. he says:--\r\n\r\n    Yo he compuesto _Romances infinitos_\r\n        Y el de los Zelos es aquel que estimo\r\n        Entre _otros, que los tengo par mal ditos_.\r\n        *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n    _Mi Filena_ *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n        Resonò _por las selvas_, &c.\r\n\r\n[332] Don Vicente de los Rios entertains so little doubt of the reality\r\nof the romantic events, recorded in the Captive, that he has interwoven\r\nthem in his account of the life of Cervantes.\r\n\r\n[333] These dramas must not be confounded with the eight well known\r\ncomedies which Cervantes subsequently wrote. His tragedy of Numantia,\r\nand his comedy of Life in Algiers, (_Trato de Argel_) appear to have\r\nbeen written at an earlier period.\r\n\r\n[334] For example, when Don Quixote speaks of the achievements of the\r\nold knights, he always uses the antiquated expression:--Las _fazañas_\r\nque han _fecho_, instead of _hazañas_ que han _hecho_.\r\n\r\n[335] In the original Spanish, the term _insula_ is uniformly employed\r\ninstead of the common word _isla_. Sancho probably understood what an\r\n_isla_ signified; but an _insula_ was a word which conveyed to his mind\r\nthe idea of something magical and extraordinary. He accordingly takes\r\na great pleasure in emphatically repeating it.\r\n\r\n[336] As one specimen out of many, it will be sufficient to quote the\r\nspeech of the shepherdess Marcella. It is in the true prose style\r\nof Cicero, and it is altogether a composition which has seldom been\r\nequalled in any modern language:--\r\n\r\nHizome el Cielo, segun vosotros dezis, hermosa, y de tal manera, que\r\nsin ser poderosos à otra cosa, à que me ameys os mueve mi hermosura. Y\r\npor al amor que me mostràys, dezis, y aun quereys que estè yo obligada\r\nà amaros. Yo conozco con el natural entendimiento, que Dios me ha dado,\r\nque todo lo hermoso es amable, mas no alcanço, que por razon de ser\r\namado, esté obligado lo que es amado por hermoso, à amar à quien le\r\nama. Y mas que podria acontecer, que el amador de lo hermoso fuèsse\r\nfeo; y siendo lo feo digno de ser aborrecido, càe muy mal el dezir:\r\nQuièrote por hermosa, hasme de amar, aunque sea feo. Pero puesto\r\ncaso que corran igualmente las hermosuras, no por esso han de correr\r\niguales los desseos; que no todas las hermosùras enamòran, que algunas\r\nalegran la vista, y no riuden la voluntad: que si todas las bellezas\r\nenamorassèn, y rindiessèn: serià un andar las voluntades confusas, y\r\ndescaminadas, sin saber en qual avian de parar; porque siendo infinitos\r\nlos Sujetos hermosos, infinitos avian de ser los dessèos: y segun yo he\r\noydo dezir, el verdadero Amor no se divide, y ha de ser voluntario, y\r\nno forçoso.\r\n\r\n[337] From _rincon_ (a corner), and _cortar_ (to shorten or cut). They\r\nare merely two humorous names for pick-pockets or purse-cutters. To\r\nthose who wish to become acquainted with the _Novelas Exemplares_, I\r\nwould recommend the edition published at Madrid in 1783, by Antonio\r\nSancha, which as far as I know is the latest.\r\n\r\n[338] A new and elegant edition of the Galatea was printed at Madrid in\r\n1784, by Antonio Sancha.\r\n\r\n[339] The following is a specimen of Cervantes’s _Versos de Arte\r\nMayor_:--\r\n\r\n        Salid de lo hondo pecho cuitado\r\n    Palabras sangrientas con muerte mezcladas,\r\n    Y si los suspiros os tienen atadas,\r\n    Abrid y romped el siniestro costado:\r\n    El aire os empide que está ya inflamado\r\n    Del fiero veneno de vuestros acentos,\r\n    Salid, y si quiera os lleven los vientos,\r\n    Que todo mi bien tambien han llevado.\r\n\r\n[340] The subjoined extract will shew that Cervantes endeavoured to\r\ncombine in his sonnets the old Spanish style with that of Petrarch.\r\n\r\n        Ligeras horas del ligero tiempo\r\n    Para mí perezosas y cansadas,\r\n    Si no estais en mi daño conjuradas,\r\n    Parezcaos ya que es de acabarme tiempo.\r\n        Si agora me acabais, hareislo á tiempo\r\n    Que estan mis desventuras mas colmadas,\r\n    Mirad que menguarán, si sois pesadas,\r\n    Que el mal se acaba, si da tiempo al tiempo.\r\n        No os pido que vengais dulces sabrosas,\r\n    Pues no hallareis camino, senda, ó paso\r\n    De reducerme al ser que ya he perdido.\r\n        Horas á qualquier otro venturosas,\r\n    Aquella dulce del mortal traspaso,\r\n    Aquella de mi muerte sola os pido.\r\n\r\n[341] It commences with the following sonorous stanzas:--\r\n\r\n        Al dulce son de mi templada lira\r\n    Prestad, pastores, el oido atento.\r\n    Oireis como en mi voz y en él respira\r\n    De mis hermanas el sagrado aliento:\r\n    Vereis como os suspende y os admira,\r\n    Y colma vuestras almas de contento,\r\n    Quando os dé relacion aqui en el suelo\r\n    De los ingenios que ya son del cielo.\r\n        Pienso canta de aquellos solamente\r\n    Aquien la parca el hilo aun no ha cortado.\r\n    De aquellos que son dignos justamente\r\n    De en tal lugar tenerle señalado:\r\n    Donde á pesar del tiempo diligente,\r\n    Por el laudable oficio acustumbrado\r\n    Vuestro vivan mil siglos sus renombres,\r\n    Sus claras obras, sus famosos nombres.\r\n\r\n[342] For example:--\r\n\r\n        O alma venturosa,\r\n    Que del humano velo\r\n    Libre al alta region viva volaste,\r\n    Dexando en tenebrosa\r\n    Carcel de desconsuelo\r\n    Mi vida, aunque contigo la llevaste!\r\n    Sin tí, escura dexaste\r\n    La luz clara del dia,\r\n    Por tierra derribada\r\n    La esperanza fundada\r\n    En al mas firme asiento de alegria:\r\n    En fin con tu partida\r\n    Quedó vivo el dolor, muerta la vida.\r\n\r\n[343]\r\n\r\n        Agora que calla el viento,\r\n    Y el soseogar està en calma,\r\n    No se calle mi tormento,\r\n    Salga con la voz el alma\r\n    Para mayor sentimiento;\r\n    Que para contar mis males,\r\n    Mostrando en parte que son\r\n    Por fuerza, han de dar señales\r\n    El alma, y el corazon\r\n    De vivas ansias mortales.\r\n\r\n[344] For example:--\r\n\r\n    Con tantas _firmas afirmas_\r\n    El amor que està en tu pecho, &c.\r\n\r\nAnd these antiquated expressions are sometimes combined with\r\nfantastical ideas.\r\n\r\n[345] For example:--Mastines _fieles_, guardadores de las _simples_\r\novejuelas, que debaxo de su amparo estan seguras de los _carniceros_\r\ndientes de los _hambrientos_ lobos.\r\n\r\n[346] Mercury thus accosts him:--\r\n\r\n    O Adan de poetas, o Cervantes!\r\n    Que alforjas y que trage es este, o amigo?\r\n\r\n[347]\r\n\r\n    De la quilla à la gavia, ó estraña cosa!\r\n        Toda de versos era fabricada,\r\n        Sin que se entremetiesa alguna prosa,\r\n    Las ballesteras eran de ensalada\r\n        De glosas, todas hechas á la boda\r\n        De la que se llamó Malmaridada.\r\n    Era la chusma de romances toda,\r\n        Gente atrevida, empero necesaria,\r\n        Pues à todas acciones se acomoda.\r\n    La popa de materia extraordinaria,\r\n        Bastarda, y de legitimos sonetos,\r\n        De labor peregrina en todo y varia.\r\n    Eran dos valentisimos tercetos\r\n        Los espaldares de la izquierda y diestra,\r\n        Para dar boga larga muy perfetos.\r\n    Hecha ser la crugia se me muestra\r\n        De una luenga y tristisima elegia,\r\n        Que no en cantar, sino en llorar es diestra.\r\n\r\n[348] A portion of this masterly description may be quoted here.\r\n\r\n    Bien asi semejaba, que se ofrece\r\n        Entre liquidas perlas y entre rosas\r\n        La aurora que despunta y amanece.\r\n    La rica vestidura, las preciosas\r\n        Joyyas que la adornaban, competian\r\n        Con las que suelen ser mirabillosas.\r\n    Las ninfas que al querer suyo asistian\r\n        En el gallardo brio y bello aspecto,\r\n        Las artes liberales parecian.\r\n    Todas con amoroso y tierno afecto,\r\n        Con las ciencias mas claras y escogidas,\r\n        Le guardaban santisimo respeto.\r\n    Mostraban que en servirla eran servidas,\r\n        Y que por su ocasion de todas gentes\r\n        En mas veneracion eran tenidas.\r\n    Su influjo y su reflujo las corrientes\r\n        Del mar y su profundo le mostraban,\r\n        Y el ser padre de rios y de fuentes.\r\n    Las yerbas su virtud la presentaban,\r\n        Los arboles sus frutos y sus flores,\r\n        Las piedras el valor que en sì encerraban.\r\n\r\n[349] The following is a passage from the description of _Vanagloria_.\r\n\r\n    En un trono del suelo levantado,\r\n        (Do el arte à la materia se adelanta\r\n        Puesto que de oro y de marfil labrado)\r\n    Una doncella vì desde la planta\r\n        Del pie hasta la cabeza asi adornada,\r\n        Que el verla admira, y el oirla encanta.\r\n    Estaba en él con magestad sentada,\r\n        Giganta al parecer en la estatura,\r\n        Pero aunque grande, bien proporcionada.\r\n    Parecia mayor su hermosura\r\n        Mirada desde lejos, y no tanto\r\n        Si de cerca se ve su compostura, &c.\r\n\r\n[350]\r\n\r\n    Turbóse en esto el liquido elemento,\r\n        De nuevo renovóse la tormenta,\r\n        Sopló mas vivo y mas apriesa el viento.\r\n    La hambrienta mesnada, y no sedienta,\r\n        Se rinde al uracan recien venido,\r\n        Y por mas no penar muere contenta.\r\n    O raro caso y por jamas oido,\r\n        Ni visto! ó nuevas y admirables trazas\r\n        De la gran reina obedecida en Guido!\r\n    En un instante el mar de calabazas\r\n        Se vió quajado, algunas tan potentes,\r\n        Que pasaban de dos, y aun de tres brazas.\r\n    Tambien hinchados odres y valientes,\r\n        Sin deshacer del mar la blanca espuma,\r\n        Nadaban de mil talles diferentes, &c.\r\n\r\n[351] These two dramas, the tragedy of Numancia and the comedy of El\r\nTrato de Argel, were first printed in an appendix to the new edition of\r\nthe _Viage al Parnaso_, published at Madrid by Don Antonio Sancha, in\r\nthe year 1784.\r\n\r\n[352] In the supplement to the _Viage al Parnaso_, Cervantes\r\nparticularly mentions his nine dramas in terms of the most decided\r\nself-satisfaction. “If they were not my own, (he says) I should declare\r\nthat they merit all the praise they have obtained.” He alludes with\r\nparticular complacency to his comedy, entitled, _La Confusa_, which\r\nhe styles a _good one among the best_. But _La Confusa_, as well as\r\nthe others which Cervantes praises, is lost. Among the eight which are\r\nknown, _La Gran Sultana_ seems to be that which Cervantes mentions\r\nunder the title of _La Gran Turquesca_.\r\n\r\n[353] See the first preface to the _Comedias y Entremeses de Miguel de\r\nCervantes_, published by Blas Nasarre, Madrid, 1749, 2 vols. 4to.\r\n\r\n[354] The departed spirit which is conjured back to the dead body,\r\ndelivers the following terrific address:--\r\n\r\n    Cese la furia del rigor violento,\r\n    Tuyo, Marquino, baste, triste, baste\r\n    La que yo paso en la region escura,\r\n    Sin que tu crezcas mas mi desventura.\r\n    Engañaste, si piensas que recibo\r\n    Contento de volver á esta penosa,\r\n    Misera y corta vida, que aora vivo,\r\n    Que yo me va faltando presurosa;\r\n    Antes me causas un dolor esquivo,\r\n    Pues otra vez la muerte rigurosa\r\n    Triunfará de mi vida y de mi alma,\r\n    Mi enemigo tendrá doblada palma; &c.\r\n\r\n[355] One of the Numantian women, for example, addresses the following\r\nspeech to the senators:--\r\n\r\n    Basta que la hambre insana\r\n    Os acabe con dolor,\r\n    Sin esperar el rigor\r\n    De la aspereza Romana.\r\n    Decildes que os engendraron\r\n    Libres, y libres nacistes,\r\n    Y que vuestras madres tristes\r\n    Tambien libres os criaron.\r\n    Decildes que pues la suerte\r\n    Nuestra va tan de caida,\r\n    Que como os dieron la vida,\r\n    Ansi mismo os den la muerte.\r\n    O muros desta ciudad,\r\n    Si podeis hablad, decid,\r\n    Y mil veces repetid:\r\n    Numantinos, libertad!\r\n\r\n[356] A mother enters with her two starving children. She carries one\r\nat the breast, and the other whom she leads by the hand, thus addresses\r\nher:--\r\n\r\n    _Hijo._   Madre, por ventura habriar\r\n              nos diese pan por esto?\r\n\r\n    _Madre._  Pan, hijo, ni aun otra cosa\r\n              Que semeje de comer!\r\n\r\n    _Hijo._   Pues tengo de parecer\r\n              De dura hambre rabiosa?\r\n              Con poco pan que me deis,\r\n              Madre, no os pediré mas.\r\n\r\n    _Madre._  Hijo, qué penas me das!\r\n\r\n    _Hijo._   Pues qué, madre, no quereis? &c.\r\n\r\n[357]\r\n\r\n    _Morandro._  Ves aqui, Lira, cumplida\r\n                 Mi palabra y mis porfias\r\n                 De que tú no moririas\r\n                 Mientras yo tuviese vida.\r\n                 Y aun podré mejor decir\r\n                 Que presto vendrás á ver\r\n                 Que á ti sobrará el comer,\r\n                 Y á mi faltará el vivir.\r\n\r\n    _Lira._      Qué dices, Morandro amado?\r\n\r\n    _Morandro._  Lira, que acortes la hambre,\r\n                 Entretanto que la estambre\r\n                 De mi vida corta el hado.\r\n                 Pero mi sangre vertida\r\n                 Y con este pan mezclada,\r\n                 Te ha de dar, mi dulce amada,\r\n                 Triste y amarga comida.\r\n\r\n[358] A new and elegant edition of the _Trabajos de Persiles y\r\nSigismunda_, was published at Madrid in 1781, by Don Antonio de Sancha,\r\nin 2 vols.\r\n\r\n[359] The biographer who wishes to compile in a perfect and authentic\r\nway, the life of Lope de Vega, already so often related, must not\r\nneglect the collection of elegies and epitaphs, which have been lately\r\nprinted, along with the hitherto scattered works of the great Spanish\r\ndramatist, (_Obras Sueltas de Lope de Vega_; Madrid, 1776, &c. 21 vols.\r\n4to.) Even Nicolas Antonio, whose manner is so jejune, and who usually\r\ndismisses poets with very little ceremony, bestows a long eulogium on\r\nLope de Vega.\r\n\r\n[360] In the prelude to the Auto _El Nombre de Jesus_ (the Name of\r\nJesus). See the _Obras Sueltas de Lope de Vega_, vol. xviii. The\r\ncountrywoman asks:--\r\n\r\n    Y que son Autos?\r\n\r\nAnd the husband replies:--\r\n\r\n    _Comedias a gloria y honor del pan_\r\n    Que tan devota celebra\r\n    Esta coronada villa.\r\n\r\n[361] Lope de Vega, in his dramas, employs the terms _actos_ and\r\n_jornadas_ indiscriminately.\r\n\r\n[362] From the very commencement of the scene, it is obvious how well\r\nLope de Vega understood the art of composing spirited dialogue.\r\n\r\n    _D. San._     A mi me cierra la puerta?\r\n\r\n    _Ançu._       Tiene muy justo temor.\r\n\r\n    _Cid._        Con ser muger se concierta.\r\n\r\n    _An._         De que te espantas señor\r\n                  que no te la tenga abierta?\r\n                  Dizen que en el Dios que adoro\r\n                  juraste quitar agora\r\n                  sin guardarles el decoro\r\n                  a doña Urraca a Zamora,\r\n                  y a Elvira su hermana a Toro.\r\n                  Pues si muerto el Rey Fernando,\r\n                  el primero de Castilla\r\n                  que esta en el cielo reynando\r\n                  por eterno cetro y silla,\r\n                  la silla mortal dexando,\r\n                  eres quien has de amparallas,\r\n                  pues otro padre no tienen,\r\n                  y quieres desheredallas.\r\n                  Que mucho si se previenen\r\n                  a defender sus murallas?\r\n\r\n    _D. San._     Conde Ançures, si jurè,\r\n                  gusto de mi padre fue,\r\n                  guardè respeto a su muerte, &c.\r\n\r\n[363] Ordonez is exhibited in rather a ludicrous light:--\r\n\r\n    _Cid._      No os prevengais que no quiero\r\n                reñir con vos.\r\n\r\n    _D. Bic._                  Porque no?\r\n\r\n    _Cid._      Porque nunca en quien temio\r\n                manchè mi gallardo azero.\r\n\r\n    _D. B._     A quien yo he temido, es hombre\r\n                que a vos os hara temblar.\r\n\r\n    _Cid._      Si es el Invierno, en lugar\r\n                frio temblar hazer a un hombre.\r\n\r\n    _D. B._     No es sino el Cid.\r\n\r\n    _Cid._      Pues si vos\r\n                temeys solo al Cid, oyd,\r\n                que a mi me temeys,\r\n                que el Cid soy.\r\n\r\n    _D. B._                     El Cid vos?\r\n\r\n    _Cid._      Si por Dios.\r\n\r\n    _D. B._     Ya que os he dicho en la cara,\r\n                invicto Cid, mi temor,\r\n                sabed, que yo soy señor,\r\n                don Diego Ordoñez de Lara.\r\n\r\n[364] He thus apostrophizes his rural retreat in the idyl style:--\r\n\r\n    _Vel._    Montes que el Duero vaña,\r\n              y en cadenas de yelo\r\n              os tiene por los verdes pies atados\r\n              desde que nuestra España\r\n              Pelayo (o fuesse el cielo)\r\n              os restauró del barbaro habitados;\r\n              de mis nobles passados,\r\n              vega de Toro hermosa,\r\n              que hazes competencia,\r\n              no solo con Plasencia,\r\n              y a la orilla del Betis generosa,\r\n              de fertiles trofeos,\r\n              mas a los campos celebres Hibleos.\r\n              Aqui donde esta casa\r\n              solar de mis abuelos\r\n              las jambas cubre de despojos Moros,\r\n              por donde alegre passa\r\n              Duero que quiebra yelos,\r\n              y cuyas Ninfas van cantando a coros,\r\n              haziendo que los poros\r\n              de la hermosa ribera,\r\n              broten las altas cañas,\r\n              anchas como espadañas,\r\n              de trigo fertil la mançana y pera;\r\n              y el razimo pessado\r\n              con verdes hilos al sarmiento atado.\r\n\r\n[365] What might not this scene have been rendered by a poet of a more\r\nregular imagination! There is, however, a certain degree of dignity\r\nin the commencement, with which the close forms a contrast the more\r\ndiscordant:--\r\n\r\n    _D. S._ Dexa las armas Elvira,\r\n            mira hermana que me corro\r\n            de sacarlas contra ti.\r\n\r\n    _Elv._  Pues vete hermano piadoso,\r\n            y dexame en mis almenas.\r\n\r\n    _D. S._ Si al assalto me dispongo,\r\n            como no vees, que este muro\r\n            quedarà de sangre rojo?\r\n\r\n    _Elv._  Si quedarà, mas serà\r\n            de la vuestra.\r\n\r\n    _D. S._                Pues yo rompo\r\n            la obligacion de sangre.\r\n\r\n    _Elv._  Y yo la defensa tomò,\r\n            que si fueras el Gigante\r\n            que tuvo el cielo en los ombros,\r\n            no pusieras pie en el muro.\r\n\r\n    _D. S.  Mira hermana que eres monstruo_\r\n            porque con tanta hermosura\r\n            _tienes pensamientos locos_.\r\n\r\n    _Elv.   El loco, el monstruo, eres tu_,\r\n            pues que tu, hermano alevoso,\r\n            me quieres quitar la herencia.\r\n\r\n[366] The following metaphorical sonnet is declaimed by Sancha:--\r\n\r\n    El agua que corrio de clara fuente\r\n        por cristalino surco al verdo prado,\r\n        detiene al labrador, porque al sembrado\r\n        acuda con mas prospera corriente.\r\n    No sale el agua, que los muros siente\r\n        del cesped, que por uno, y otro lado\r\n        cercan su arroyo, que en la presa atado\r\n        hazen, que a ser estan que el curso aumente.\r\n    Ansi sucede amor en sus antojos,\r\n        quando el honor del resistirse vale,\r\n        callando penas, y sufriendo enojos.\r\n    Dexale el al almo, que la presa yguale,\r\n        y brota por los cercos de los ojos,\r\n        ò rompe la pared, y junto sale.\r\n\r\n[367] Among other things she says:--\r\n\r\n            Como he dado en no casarme,\r\n            leo por entretenerme,\r\n            no por Bachillera hazerme\r\n            y de aguda graduarme.\r\n            Que a quien su buena opinion\r\n            encierra en silencio tal,\r\n            no halla en los libros mal,\r\n            gustosa conversacion.\r\n            Es qualquier libro discreto\r\n            que si causa de hablar dexa,\r\n            es amigo que aconseja\r\n            y reprehende en secreto.\r\n            Al fin despues que los leo\r\n            y trato de devocion\r\n            de alguna imaginacion\r\n            voy castigando el desseo.\r\n\r\n    _Ju._   Y en que materia leias?\r\n\r\n    _Leo._  De oracion.\r\n\r\n    _Ju._               Quien no se goza\r\n            de ver que tan bella moça\r\n            tan santas custumbres crias.\r\n\r\n[368]\r\n\r\n    _Leo._  Juzgaras a liviandad\r\n            hallarme con el espejo,\r\n            Que suele ser conocida\r\n            la mucha de una muger\r\n            en yrse, y venirse a ver\r\n            despues de una vez vestida.\r\n            Y yo conforme a mi estado\r\n            hago en esso mas delito.\r\n\r\n    _Lu._   A enojo siempre me incito\r\n            con tu melindre estremado.\r\n            Es mucho que una muger\r\n            que ha de estar un dia compuesta,\r\n            vaya a ver si està bien puesta\r\n            la toca o el alfiler?\r\n            Quien se lo dira mejor\r\n            si esta bien, o si està mal\r\n            que esso palmo de cristal?\r\n\r\n    _Leo._  Como disculpas mi error.\r\n\r\n[369] This sketch is well worth transcribing:--\r\n\r\n    No sino venga un mancebo\r\n    destos de aora de alcorça\r\n    con el sombrerito a horza,\r\n    pluma corta, cordon nuevo,\r\n    cuello abierto muy parejo,\r\n    puños a lo Veneciano,\r\n    lo de fuera limpio, y sano,\r\n    lo de dentro suzio y viejo,\r\n    botas justas sin podellas\r\n    descalçar en todo un mes,\r\n    las calças hasta los pies,\r\n    el vigote a las estrellas;\r\n    xabonzillos, y copete,\r\n    cadena falsa que assombre\r\n    guantes de ambar, y grande hombre\r\n    de un soneto, y un villete;\r\n    y con sus manos lavadas\r\n    los tres mil de renta pesque\r\n    con que un poco se refresque\r\n    entre savanas delgadas:\r\n    y passados ocho dias\r\n    se vaya a ver forasteras,\r\n    o en amistades primeras,\r\n    buelva a deshazer las mias.\r\n\r\n[370] This whimsical adventure is thus described:--\r\n\r\n    Yo que estava en un esquina\r\n    mirandolo desde lexos,\r\n    apresurè luego el passo.\r\n    llevandome el ayre en peso.\r\n    Llegando a la amada puerta\r\n    vi un bulto a mis ojos negro,\r\n    con su capa, y con su espada,\r\n    mirando, y hablando a dentro.\r\n    Llegueme a el, y metime\r\n    hasta la harba el sombrero,\r\n    y dixele: a gentilhombre!\r\n    terciando el corto herreruelo.\r\n    Como no me respondia,\r\n    saco la daga de presto,\r\n    y por el pecho a mi gusto\r\n    hasta la cruz se la meto.\r\n    Diome la sangre en el mio,\r\n    y bueto mi casa huyendo\r\n    miro a una luz la ropilla,\r\n    y olia como un incienso.\r\n    Tomo una linterna, y parto,\r\n    y quando a mirar le buelvo,\r\n    hallo derramado el vino,\r\n    y el cuero midiendo el suelo.\r\n\r\n[371] Those who are unacquainted with the Spanish language, must not\r\nsuppose that the term _gracioso_, as applied to this kind of character,\r\nis an extraordinary instance of that figure of speech called euphemism.\r\nIn Spanish, _gracioso_ more frequently signifies comic and ludicrous,\r\nthan graceful.\r\n\r\n[372]\r\n\r\n    _Ju._   La colacion viene.\r\n\r\n    _C._                       En vano,\r\n            viene, a fe de gentilhombre\r\n            que no tengo de comer.\r\n\r\n    _Leo._  A lo manos el provar\r\n            no lo podeys escusar,\r\n            que soy honrada muger.\r\n\r\n    _Cam._  Es lo del veneno?\r\n\r\n    _Leo._                    Si,\r\n            por mi vida que proveys.\r\n\r\n    _Cam._  Si ese juramento hazeys\r\n            aya mil muertes aqui.\r\n            Quiero tomar el veneno\r\n            que Alexandro del Doctor,\r\n            que donde la fe es mayor,\r\n            no le haze el daño ageno.\r\n\r\n    _Urb._  O lo que sabe de historia.\r\n\r\n    _Ju._   En verdad que es muy leydo.\r\n    _Urb._  No lo tomeys tan polido,\r\n            que en verdad que es çanahoria\r\n            Entro, y la bevida saco.\r\n\r\n[373] St. Nicolas de Tolentino is a saint of modern creation.\r\n\r\n[374] The sonnet by which St. Nicolas performs this miracle, is the\r\nmost beautiful in this sacred farce.\r\n\r\n    Virgen, Paloma candida, que al suelo\r\n        Traxo la verde paz; arco divino,\r\n        Que con las tres colores a dar vino\r\n        Fe del concierto entre la tierra, y cielo;\r\n    Dadme remedio, pues sabeys mi zelo!\r\n        No coma carne yo, porque imagino,\r\n        Que solo he de comer, puesto que indigno\r\n        La de mi dulce amor en blanco velo.\r\n    No me dexeys, Christifera Maria,\r\n        Y vos mi Padre amado, Agustin Santo,\r\n        Y mas si llega de mi muerte el dia.\r\n    Dadme los dos favor, pues podeys tanto,\r\n        Si mereciere la esperança mia,\r\n        Que del Sol que pisays pase mi llanto.\r\n\r\n[375] The following is the edifying scene. _Dem._ is a contraction for\r\nDemonio, the devil. _Rup._ stands for Ruperto, the monk, who attacks\r\nand subdues him with the broom. _Pri._ signifies prior.\r\n\r\n    _Rup._  Aqui Padres aqui, mueran los perros.\r\n\r\n    _Pri._  Que visiones estrañas?\r\n\r\n    _Rup._                         Sombras vanas,\r\n            Ruperto soy: figuras Antonianas,\r\n            dexad mi Santo.\r\n\r\n    _Dem._                  Infame tu te pones\r\n            con nosotros a manos, y razones?\r\n\r\n    _Rup._  Fuera digo, bellacos.\r\n\r\n    _Dem._                        Pues infame\r\n            concorrion assi te atreves?\r\n\r\n    _Rup._                              Bestia,\r\n            sal de la celda.\r\n\r\n    _Dem._                   O vil espuma ollas.\r\n\r\n    _Rup._  Hago muy bien, vos espumays calderas.\r\n            Llegue Padre Prior.\r\n\r\n    _Pri._                      Aqui a este lado\r\n            digo los exorcismos de la Iglesia.\r\n\r\n    _Dem._  O perro motilon.\r\n\r\n    _Rup._                   A fuera.\r\n\r\n    _Dem._                            O pesia.\r\n\r\n[376] Care announces Man.\r\n\r\n    _Cuidad._     El Hombre está aqui.\r\n\r\n    _Homb._       Dame essos pies.\r\n\r\n    _Principe._                    Ya te doy\r\n                  el corazon.\r\n\r\n    _Homb._                   Luz mas pura\r\n                  que el sol, imagen divina\r\n                  de tu Padre; que diré\r\n                  de tu piedad? que daré\r\n                  a tu amor!\r\n\r\n    _Principe._              La vista inclina\r\n                  al supremo tribunal:\r\n                  sabe conmigo y haremos\r\n                  esta escritura.\r\n\r\n    _Homb._                       Qué extremos\r\n                  de amor, piedad celestial!\r\n\r\n    _Principe._   Sube tú como deudor\r\n                  a los estrados que ves,\r\n                  amigo, que yo despues\r\n                  bajaré como fiador.\r\n\r\n[377] Reflection disputes with the devil on this point.\r\n\r\n    _Demon._    Mienten, que un hora segura\r\n                aun no logré mi ventura,\r\n                pues de qué logrero soy,\r\n                si ha tantos años que estoy\r\n                sin Dios en carcel tan dura?\r\n                Qué es lo que estan escribiendo?\r\n\r\n    _Cuidad._   La fianza.\r\n\r\n    _Demon._               Quién le fia?\r\n\r\n    _Cuidad._   Dios, que Dios solo podia.\r\n\r\n    _Demon._    Dios fia?\r\n\r\n    _Cuidad._             Ya están leyendo.\r\n\r\n    _Justic._   Oid.\r\n\r\n    _Princ._         Ya estoy oyendo.\r\n\r\n    _Justic._   Que os obligais, gran Señor,\r\n                como principal deudor\r\n                a padecerlo y servir.\r\n\r\n    _Demon._    Ha se visto tanto amor!\r\n\r\n[378] A list of the dramas contained in these twenty-five volumes\r\nis given by Nicolas Antonio, who likewise communicates information\r\nconcerning Lope’s other works. A gleaning of some pieces may be found\r\nin the _Obras Sueltas_; see note, p. 363. I have never yet seen all\r\nthe twenty-five volumes together. Even in Spain a complete collection\r\nis but rarely to be met with. Single dramas by Lope are to be found\r\nin most of the numerous collections of Spanish comedies by various\r\nauthors. La Huerta in his collection has not included a single play of\r\nLope de Vega, doubtless for reasons which will hereafter be noticed.\r\n\r\n[379] The twelve collected by Ortiz de Villena, together with the Loas\r\nand Entremeses belonging to them, are newly printed in the _Obras\r\nSueltas_, vol. xviii.\r\n\r\n[380] For example, _El Castigo sin Venganza_, (The Punishment without\r\nRevenge) in the _Obras Sueltas_, vol. viii.\r\n\r\n[381] The _Obras Sueltas_ contain abundant materials for such a work.\r\n\r\n[382] See the _Obras Sueltas_, vols. xv. and xvi.\r\n\r\n[383] Vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[384] See the _Obras Sueltas_, vol iv.\r\n\r\n[385] Vol. iii.\r\n\r\n[386] Vol. vi.\r\n\r\n[387] Vol. iv.\r\n\r\n[388] Vol. xvii.\r\n\r\n[389] Vol. i. and the succeeding volumes.\r\n\r\n[390] Vol. i.\r\n\r\n[391] Vol. xix. and likewise in the _Parnaso Español_.\r\n\r\n[392] See the _Obras Sueltas_, vol. xix.\r\n\r\n[393] Vols. v. & vi.\r\n\r\n[394] Vol. vii.\r\n\r\n[395] Vol. viii.--It is presumed that these bibliographic notices\r\nwill not be unacceptable to those who wish to become acquainted with\r\nindividual works of Lope de Vega.\r\n\r\n[396] An account of the life of these brothers is prefixed to their\r\nworks in the _Parnaso Español_, vols. iii. and vi.; and also to the\r\nnew edition of their _Rimas_, by Don Ramon Fernandez, Madrid, 1786, 3\r\nvolumes 8vo.\r\n\r\n[397] They are printed in the sixth volume of the _Parnaso Español_.\r\n\r\n[398] The king shews to his faithless consort, Alexandra, the body of\r\nher murdered lover.\r\n\r\n    Cómo, Alejandra, no miras\r\n    este noble corazon,\r\n    dó se forjó la traycion,\r\n    cubierto de mil mentiras?\r\n    Y pues el tuyo, cruel,\r\n    te bolvió conmigo dura,\r\n    miralo, que por ventura\r\n    está tu retrato en él.\r\n    Esos son aquellos brazos,\r\n    por los quales me aborreces,\r\n    que ciñeron tantas veces\r\n    tu cuello con torpes lazos.\r\n    Estos son contra mi honra\r\n    aquellos brazos valientes,\r\n    y estos los pies diligentes\r\n    en procurar mi deshonra.\r\n    Mira tambien la cabeza,\r\n    la boca, los claros ojos:\r\n    huelga con tales despojos:\r\n    miralos pieza por pieza;\r\n    que por quererlos tú tanto,\r\n    los he mandado guardar.\r\n    Piensasle resuscitar\r\n    aora con ese llanto?\r\n\r\nAfter a pause of horror and grief, Alexandra breaks forth in the\r\nfollowing monologue:--\r\n\r\n    No puedo triste vengarme.\r\n    O vosotros, soberranos!\r\n    ya que me faltan las manos,\r\n    dadme voz para quejarme.\r\n    Cielos, justicia venganza!\r\n    No os atapeis los oidos\r\n    dioses sordos adormidos,\r\n    si algo con ruegos se alcanza.\r\n    Y pues que los celestiales\r\n    niegan tambien su favor,\r\n    salid del eterno horror,\r\n    negros dioses infernales.\r\n    Por qué no temblaste, suelo?\r\n    por qué las piedras no saltan?\r\n    Qué es esto, que todos faltan,\r\n    y no llueve sangre el cielo?\r\n\r\n[399] For example, the following:--\r\n\r\n        Bramando el mar hinchado\r\n    Con las nubes procura\r\n    Mezclar sus olas, y apagar la lumbre\r\n    Del concavo estrellado,\r\n    Y de la horrible hondura\r\n    Trasladar sus arenas à la cumbre;\r\n    Pero con la costumbre\r\n    De estos trabajos graves,\r\n    El hijo de Laertes\r\n    Rompe con brazos fuertes,\r\n    Lo que apénas pudieran altas naves\r\n    Con las proas ferradas,\r\n    Por otro Palinuro gobernadas.\r\n        Mas Ino, inmortal Diosa,\r\n    Viendo al prudente Griego\r\n    En tan grande peligro de la vida,\r\n    Benigna y amorosa\r\n    Buscó remedio luego\r\n    Para facilitalle la salida;\r\n    Y de piedad movida\r\n    Le dió el divino velo,\r\n    Con que cubrir solia\r\n    El cabello, que hacia\r\n    Escurecer al Dios nacido en Delo;\r\n    Y en virtud de esta toca\r\n    El mar se allana, y el la tierra toca.\r\n\r\n[400] As in the following:--\r\n\r\n        Imagen espantosa de la muerte,\r\n    Sueño cruel, no turbes mas mi pecho,\r\n    Mostrándome cortado el nudo estrecho,\r\n    Consuelo solo de mi adversa suerte.\r\n        Busca de algun tirano el muro fuerte,\r\n    De jaspe paredes, de oro el techo;\r\n    O el rico avara en el angosto lecho\r\n    Haz que temblando con sudor despierte,\r\n        El uno vea el popular tumulto\r\n    Romper con furia las herredas puertas,\r\n    O al sobornado siervo el hierro oculto.\r\n        El otro sus riquezas descubiertas\r\n    Con llave falsa, o con violento insulto;\r\n    Y dexale al amor sus glorias ciertas.\r\n\r\n[401] The following satirical passage occurs in his longest epistle,\r\nwhich is addressed to a friend, and in which he has developed his whole\r\nturn of temper and thought:--\r\n\r\n        Aunque el pintado pabo y la gallina\r\n    De l’Africa jamás como á los Grandes,\r\n    Ni un Mase Jaques honre mi cocina:\r\n        Ni lo traiga pagado desde Flandes,\r\n    Porque sabe á la hambre hacer cosquillas,\r\n    Y entretenerla todo lo que mandes.\r\n        Ni me alegren los ojos las boxillas,\r\n    Que lo ménos que tengan sea el ser oro,\r\n    Tanto el Arte estremo sus maravillas.\r\n        Que si en mi casa, como digo, móro,\r\n    No trocaré mi vida con sosiego\r\n    Por el Romano, ni el Imperio Moro.\r\n        Ni Mercurio jamas oirà mi ruego\r\n    Un Cielo mas arriba de la Luna,\r\n    Ni en su Altar por mis manos verá fuego.\r\n        Ni yo diré mas mal de la fortuna\r\n    Que de una viuda santa y recogida,\r\n    (Si santa y recogida se halla alguna).\r\n\r\n[402] The irony might be more delicate; but it is, nevertheless, well\r\nexpressed:--\r\n\r\n        Escríbate pues sátiras quien quiera,\r\n    Que yo al banzas solas quiero darte,\r\n    Hasta que tú te canses, ó yo muera.\r\n        Ya, ya me tienes, Flora, de tu parte,\r\n    Que, como tus costumbres amo tanto,\r\n    Mudable soy tambien por imitarte.\r\n        Quiero dexar la pluma, que me espanto\r\n    De ver ese furor tras ordinario,\r\n    Y dar de contricion señal con llanto.\r\n        Pero tengo conmigo un tu contrario,\r\n    Que tiene prometido defenderme\r\n    Contra el poder de Xerxes, y de Dario:\r\n        Y no me dá lugar de recogerme,\r\n    Antes con amenazas me provoca:\r\n    Dios sabe si ofenderte es ofenderme.\r\n\r\n[403] For example:--\r\n\r\n        Ni à Italia has de pasar por Beneficios,\r\n    Para darles asalto con la capa\r\n    De que son subrepticios, ó obrepticios.\r\n        Para engañarlo no verás al Papa,\r\n    Aunque te llame el golfo de Narbona\r\n    Tan pacífico en sí, como en el mapa:\r\n        Que si Micer Pandolfo trae corona,\r\n    Y prebendado ha vuelto ya, Dios sabe\r\n    Quál Simon le ayudo, Mago, ó Barjona.\r\n        Ya ni en sí mismo, ni en su Patria cabe,\r\n    Ni de su loba pródiga las baras\r\n    De gorgarán en su espaciosa nave.\r\n        Si tú por estos términos medráras,\r\n    Qué bascas, qué visages y figuras\r\n    De puro escrupoloso nos mostráras!\r\n\r\n[404] The following passage occurs in an epistle to a friend who wished\r\nto send his son to court while very young, in order that he might\r\nbecome early acquainted with the great world:--\r\n\r\n        Mirando estoy, que te santiguas desto,\r\n    Y que enojado quedas, ó risueño,\r\n    Llamándome Filósofo molesto.\r\n        Pues enfrena la risa, ò templa el ceño,\r\n    Y en mi defensa escuchame entretanto,\r\n    Que estas proposiciones desempeño.\r\n        Si está en verdad, que no nos mueve tanto\r\n    Docta declamacion, Griega, ó Latina,\r\n    Como el exemplo vivo, ó torpe, ó santo:\r\n        Del padre, que á sus hijas disciplina\r\n    Con mal exemplo, quién dirá que es prueba\r\n    De la águila, que al sol los exâmina\r\n        Pues dar rienda á la edad ferviente y nueva,\r\n    No es culpa de indiscreto amor paterno,\r\n    Que á manifiesta perdicion la lleva?\r\n        El diestro agricultor al arbol tierno,\r\n    De recientes raices, no lo expone\r\n    Luego á las inclemencias del inbierno.\r\n\r\n[405] The following sonnet, addressed to an old coquette, may serve as\r\nan example:--\r\n\r\n        Pon, Lice, tus cabellos con legias\r\n    De venerables, si no rubios, rojos,\r\n    Que el tiempo vengador busca despojos,\r\n    Y no para volver huyen los dias.\r\n        Ya las mexillas, que avultar porfias,\r\n    Cierra en perfiles lánguidos, y flojos:\r\n    Su hermosa atrocidad nobó á los ojos,\r\n    Y apriesa te desarma las encías.\r\n        Pero tú acude por socorro al arte,\r\n    Que, aun con sus fraudes, quiero que defiendas\r\n    Al desengaño descortés la entrada.\r\n        Con pacto (y por tu bien) que no pretendas\r\n    Reducida á ruïnas, ser amada,\r\n    Sino es de tí, si puedes engañarte.\r\n\r\n[406] For example, the first stanzas of an ode on the immaculate\r\nconception of the holy virgin:--\r\n\r\n        A todos los espíritus amantes,\r\n    Que en círculo de luz inaccesible\r\n    Forman amphiteatros celestiales,\r\n    Dixo el Padre comun, ya no terrible\r\n    Bibrando rayos vengativos, antes\r\n    Con manso aspecto, grato á los mortales:\r\n    Ya es tiempo de admitir á los umbrales\r\n    Del Reyno eterno los del baxo mundo,\r\n    Que su gemido, y su miseria vence.\r\n    Y porque la gran obra se comience,\r\n    Muestre la idea del saber profundo\r\n    Su concepto fecundo,\r\n    La preservada esposa: que en saliendo,\r\n    El pacífico cetro de oro estiendo.\r\n\r\n[407] On one occasion Argensola thus apostrophizes Mary Magdalen:--\r\n\r\n        O tu siempre dichosa pecadora,\r\n    La que fuiste por tal con grande espanto\r\n    Del vulgo con el dedo señalada!\r\n    Tus lagrimas con Christo pueden tanto,\r\n    Que la menor lo enciende y enamora,\r\n    Y á la culpa mayor dexa anegada.\r\n    Tu quedas en Apostol transformada,\r\n    Y de ignorante y mala, santa y sabia.\r\n    No es mucho que la zarza en flor se mude,\r\n    Y que el álamo sude\r\n    En competencia de la mirra Arabia;\r\n    Y que quando de yerba al campo priva,\r\n    La mies en abundancia se recoja.\r\n    Venid á ver de rosas y azucenas\r\n    Las montañas estériles mas llenas,\r\n    Y un arbol seco revestido de hoja.\r\n    La planta antes inutil Dios cultiva:\r\n    Regada en su jardin con agua viva,\r\n    Es fructífera ya, y sus ramas bellas\r\n    Tocan continuamente en las estrellas.\r\n\r\n[408] _Conquista de las Islas Molucas, al Rey Felipe III. &c._ (written\r\nat an earlier period than the Annals of Arragon), _por el Licenciado\r\nBartholemè Leonardo de Argensola._ Madrid, 1609, in folio. The library\r\nof the University of Gottingen contains this work, and also that next\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\n[409] _Primera parte_, (a second part was intended to follow), _de los\r\nAnales de Aragon que prosigue los de G.

The description of the magic palace deserves, however, to\r\nbe quoted:--\r\n\r\n        Tenia el suelo por orden ladrillado\r\n    de cristalinas losas trasparentes,\r\n    que el color contrapuesto y variado\r\n    hacía labor y visos diferentes:\r\n    el cielo alto diáfano estrellado\r\n    de inumerables piedras relucientes,\r\n    que toda la gran cámara alegraba\r\n    la vária luz que dellas revocaba.\r\n        Sobre colunas de oro sustentadas\r\n    cien figuras de bulto entórno estaban,\r\n    por arte tan al vivo trasladadas,\r\n    que un sordo bien pensára que hablaban:\r\n    y dellas las hazañas figuradas\r\n    por las anchas paredes se mostraban,\r\n    donde se vía el extremo y excelencia\r\n    de armas, letras, virtud, y continencia.\r\n        En medio desta cámara espaciosa,\r\n    que media milla en quadro contenia,\r\n    estaba una gran ponia milagrosa,\r\n    que una luciente esfera la ceñia,\r\n    que por arte y labor maravillosa\r\n    en el ayre por sí se sostenia\r\n    que el gran círculo y máquina de dentro\r\n    parece que estrivaban en su centro.\r\n\r\n[413] Glaura thus speaks of the dangers to which her virtue was exposed\r\nthrough the ardour of her lover’s tenderness:--\r\n\r\n        Visto yo que por muestras y rodeo\r\n    muchas veces su pena descubria,\r\n    conocé que su intento y mal deseo\r\n    de los honestos limites salia:\r\n    mas ay! que en lo que yo padezco veo\r\n    lo que el misero entonces padecia,\r\n    que a término he llegado al pie del palo,\r\n    que aun no puedo decir mal de lo malo.\r\n        Hallábale mil veces suspirando\r\n    en mí los engañados ojos puestos,\r\n    otros andaba tímido tentando\r\n    entrada a sus osados presupuestos:\r\n    yo la ocasion dañosa desviando,\r\n    con gravedad y términos honestos\r\n    (que es lo que mas refrena la osadia)\r\n    sus erradas quimeras deshacia.\r\n        Estando sola en mi aposento un dia\r\n    temerosa de algun atrevimiento,\r\n    ante mí de rodillas se ponia\r\n    con grande turbacion, y desatiento:\r\n    diciendome temblando: o Glaura mia,\r\n    ya no basta razon, ni sufrimiento,\r\n    ni de fuerza una mínima me queda,\r\n    que a la del fuerte amor resistir pueda. &c.\r\n\r\n[414] Even Voltaire bears testimony to the excellence of this speech;\r\nand Voltaire was certainly a judge of rhetorical excellence, though not\r\nof poetical. The address commences thus:--\r\n\r\n        Caciques del Estado defendores,\r\n    codicia del mandar no me convida\r\n    a pesarme de versos pretensores\r\n    de cosa que a mí tanto era debida;\r\n    porque segun mi edad, yá veis, señores,\r\n    que estoy al otro mundo de partida;\r\n    mas el amor que siempre os he mostrado,\r\n    a bien aconsejaros me ha incitado.\r\n        Por qué cargos honrosos pretendemos,\r\n    Y ser en opinion grande tenidos,\r\n    pues que negar al mundo no podemos\r\n    haber sido sujetos y vencidos?\r\n    y en esto averiguarnos no queremos\r\n    estando aun de Españoles oprimidos:\r\n    mejor fuera esta furia egecutalla\r\n    contra el fiero enemigo en la batalla, &c.\r\n\r\n[415] Velasquez and Dieze, p. 383, give numerous bibliographical\r\nnotices of these works.\r\n\r\n[416] For example, in the following description of rural tranquillity:--\r\n\r\n        Ay apacible y sosegada vida,\r\n    de vulgar sujecion libre y esenta,\r\n    dó el alma se sustenta\r\n    con blanda soledad entretenida;\r\n    dó nunca tuvo la malicia entrada,\r\n      ni desagrada\r\n      mansa pobreza:\r\n      todo es llaneza\r\n      sincéra y pura\r\n      dó nunca dura\r\n    el fingido doblez qué al alma gasta;\r\n    ni al humílde espíritu contrasta!\r\n        Aqui sustenta el mísero villano,\r\n    sin artificio ó cautelosa mañana,\r\n    la bellota ó castaña,\r\n    apedreada de la simple mano.\r\n    Dale del agua pura y trasparente\r\n      la clara fuente\r\n      no le molesta\r\n      calor de siesta;\r\n      y si le ofende\r\n      luego se tiende\r\n    bajo de un estendido sauce ó robre,\r\n    contento, sin mirar si es rico ó pobre, &c.\r\n\r\n[417] Several of Espinel’s prose works are inserted in the third volume\r\nof the _Parnaso Español_; and the translation of the Epistle to the\r\nPisones, forms the commencement of the first volume of that collection.\r\n\r\n[418] For example, the following. The prevailing idea is not new; but\r\nit is followed up in the genuine spirit of sonnet composition.\r\n\r\n    Jamas el cielo vio llegar Piloto\r\n      Al desseado puerto tan contento\r\n      De las furiosas olas y del viento\r\n      La nave sin timon, y el arbol roto,\r\n    Y tomando la tierra tan devoto\r\n      Correr al templo con piadoso intento,\r\n      Y en el por verse puesto en salvamento\r\n      Colgar las ropas, y cumplir el voto:\r\n    Qual yo escape del mar del llanto mio,\r\n      Passada la borrasca de mi pena,\r\n      Y en el puerto surgi del desengaño,\r\n    Cuyo templo adorne de mi navio,\r\n      Colge mis esperanças y cadena,\r\n      Por ser mi bien el fruto de mi daño.\r\n\r\n[419] The following is the first stanza of his cancion on the ascension\r\nof the Holy Virgin:--\r\n\r\n    Angelicas esquadras que en las salas\r\n      Llenas de olor de gloria, con inmenso\r\n      Gozo, de que llenays el claro Cielo,\r\n      Andays batiendo las doradas alas,\r\n      Y al eterno Regente days encienso,\r\n      Que olor espira de inmortal consuelo,\r\n      Torced el blando buelo,\r\n      Y recebid en vuestras bellas plumas\r\n      A la que encierra en si las gracias sumas,\r\n      Pues que rompiendo la fulgente massa\r\n      Del Cielo cristalina\r\n      Que a la tierra e sirve de cortina,\r\n      Veys que el un firmamento y otro passa\r\n      Hasta llegar al trono do reside\r\n      El que del Cielo el movimiento mide.\r\n\r\n[420] His epistles in the satirical style are, however, so full of\r\nallusions to particular circumstances which occurred during the life of\r\nthe author, that they are not easily understood. The following passage\r\nis from an epistle on the Spanish comedy.\r\n\r\n        Si quando Rey, como Señor se sienta\r\n    si cobra quando Cid tantos aceros,\r\n    que al parecer emprenderá a cinquenta,\r\n        Es a dicha Morales, o Cisneros?\r\n    o es la triste Belerma Mariflores,\r\n    quando a llanto y pasion puede moveros?\r\n        Claro es que no son ellos pues, Señores,\r\n    qué importa a la Comedia que sean malos,\r\n    si para recitar son los mejores?\r\n        Los palos, que se dán alli son palos\r\n    a los que como simples los reciben.\r\n    El entremés fingido afrentarálos?\r\n        A dicha los que mueren no reviven?\r\n    y si es que lo requiere la maraña,\r\n    los que lo fingen paren, o conciben?\r\n        Sola la vista y opinion se engaña,\r\n    y asi el vicio y virtud de ellos no ofende,\r\n    ni a la Comedia en un cabello daña.\r\n\r\n[421] The following colloquial sonnet may serve as an example:--\r\n\r\n    _A._  Quién vive aqui?\r\n\r\n    _C._                   Un pobre peregrino.\r\n\r\n    _A._  Pues peregrino con hogar y casa?\r\n\r\n    _C._  No la veis toda ya desierta y rasa,\r\n          que solo este sobrado quedó en pino?\r\n\r\n    _A._  Quién os retrajo a tal lugar?\r\n\r\n    _C._                                Mi sino.\r\n\r\n    _A._  Quién sois?\r\n\r\n    _C._              Soy viento que no vuelve, y pasa:\r\n          tuve favor del mundo, fuí del asa;\r\n          pasó el buen tiempo, y el adverso vino.\r\n\r\n    _A._  Qué haceis aqui?\r\n\r\n    _C._                   Un cesto, una canasta,\r\n          tal vez de mimbre, tal de seco esparto,\r\n          con que gano el sustento que me basta.\r\n          Y no me vi (os prometo) jamás harto\r\n          de pretensiones militares hasta\r\n          que el desengaño me alquiló este cuarto.\r\n\r\n[422] For example:--\r\n\r\n    Quién se fuera a la Zono inhabitable\r\n        por no perder del todo la paciencia,\r\n        que quieren que lo sufra, y que no hable!\r\n    Tubieron Persio y Juvenal licencia\r\n        de corregir las faltas del Imperio;\r\n        y no he de hacer yo escrúpulo y conciencia,\r\n    Viendo en una ventana una Glicerio,\r\n        una segunda Venus, que la ocupa,\r\n        donde pensaste que era un Monasterio,\r\n    Y que a la mar se arroje la chalupa,\r\n        como la galeaza, y tienda velas,\r\n        y tanto aquesta, como aquella chupa?\r\n    Mas quién no ha de calzarsa las espuelas,\r\n        por no ver afeitada, como guinda,\r\n        la que ha perdido en navegar las muelas?\r\n\r\n[423] One of these compositions commences in the following way:--\r\n\r\n        Qual llena de rocio\r\n    suele salir, los campos alegrando,\r\n    la clara Aurora con el rostro helado,\r\n    sutil aura soplando,\r\n    tal por el verde prado\r\n    salío mi pastorcilla al llanto mio,\r\n    dejando alegre el suelo,\r\n    y de sus gracias embidioso el cielo.\r\n        Esparcese sin arte\r\n    sobre la nieve del marmoreo cuello,\r\n    tirada en hebras larga vena de oro;\r\n    y para euriquecello\r\n    en dos madejas varias se reparte,\r\n    con bien mayor tesoro,\r\n    descubriendo la cara\r\n    mas que la luna y las estrellas clara.\r\n        La tierna yerva crece,\r\n    donde la planta sienta, y eria olores,\r\n    y el arbol que desgaja con su mano\r\n    pimpollos brota y flores,\r\n    y el ayre fresco y vano,\r\n    hablando con olores lo enriquece,\r\n    y lleno de alegria\r\n    promete al mundo venturoso dia.\r\n\r\n[424] The curate in Don Quixote, during the examination of the knight’s\r\nlibrary, says, that if these Tears had been doomed to be burnt, he\r\nhimself should have shed tears. I have not seen the book in any\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n[425] For example:--\r\n\r\n        Ya en sus troncos nativos\r\n    temerosa la sombra se recoge,\r\n    y deja la floresta\r\n    por bien pasar la fatigada siesta:\r\n    ya el zefiro ligero, que despliega\r\n    sus alas al nacer del Sol dorado,\r\n    con arrullos lascivos\r\n    al vendor de los hojas las entrega,\r\n    y al blanco lirio en el sediento prado\r\n    sobre los hombros de la flor vecina\r\n    el cuello enfermo del calor inclina:\r\n    Marcelo, al Olmo erguido, si te place,\r\n    los pasos encamina,\r\n    que al baño de las Náyades cortina\r\n    entretegido con la yedra hace:\r\n    sonará tu zampoña dulcemente,\r\n    suave tu zampoña,\r\n    con quien las duras sierpes su ponzoña,\r\n    los vientos su braveza,\r\n    y las fieras suspenden su aspereza.\r\n\r\n[426] One of Martin’s most charming madrigals may be transcribed here:--\r\n\r\n    Iba cogiendo flores,\r\n        y guardando en la falda\r\n        mi Ninfa, para hacer una guirlanda;\r\n        mas primero las toca\r\n        a las rosados labio de su boca,\r\n        y les dá de su aliento los olores;\r\n        y estaba (por su bien) entre una rosa\r\n        una abeja éscondida,\r\n        su dulce humor hurtando;\r\n        y como en la hermosa\r\n        flor de los labios se halló, atrevida,\r\n        la picó, sacó miel, fuese volando.\r\n\r\n[427] The following seems to have been vastly admired by some critics,\r\nsince it has found its way into various collections:--\r\n\r\n    Revelome ayer Luysa\r\n        Un caso bien de reyr,\r\n            Quierotelo, Ines, dezir,\r\n        Porque de caygas de risa.\r\n    Has de saber que su tia,\r\n        No puedo de risa, Ynes\r\n            Quiero reyrme, y despues\r\n        Lo dire quando no ria.\r\n\r\n[428] For example, the following trifle:--\r\n\r\n    Madalena me picò\r\n        Con un alfiler el dedo,\r\n        Dixele: Picado quedo,\r\n        Pero ya lo estava yo.\r\n    Riose, y con su cordura\r\n        Acudio al remedio presto,\r\n        Chupòme el dedo, y con esto\r\n        Sanè de la picadura.\r\n\r\n[429] For example:--\r\n\r\n    Suelta la venda, sucio y asqueroso:\r\n    laba los ojos llenos de legañas:\r\n    cubre las carnes y lugares feos,\r\n        hijo de Venus.\r\n    Deja las alas, las doradas flechas,\r\n    arco, y aljaba, y el ardiente fuego,\r\n    para que en falta tuya lo gobierne\r\n        hombre de seso.\r\n\r\n[430] See page 37.\r\n\r\n[431] One of his canciones addressed to his country, commences in the\r\nfollowing manner:--\r\n\r\n        Levante noble España\r\n    tu coronada frente,\r\n    y alégrate de verre renascida\r\n    por todo quanto baña\r\n    en torno la corriente\r\n    del uno y otro mar con mejor vida,\r\n    qual Fenix encendida\r\n    en gloriosa llama\r\n    de ingenio soberano\r\n    muy alto y muy humano,\r\n    que á tí y á sí dió vida y inmortal fama,\r\n    que durará en el suelo\r\n    quanto la inmortal obra de Marcelo.\r\n        Dejaron muy escura\r\n    las importunas guerras\r\n    de Vándalos y Godos generosos\r\n    la antigua hermosura\r\n    de tus felices tierras\r\n    y sitios de tus pueblos glorïosos:\r\n    y al fin mas invidiosos\r\n    dé tu belleza ilustre\r\n    los fieros Africanos\r\n    con muy profanas manos\r\n    estragaron del todo el sacro lustre\r\n    del terreno mas lindo\r\n    que hay desde el mar Atlantico hasta el Indo.\r\n\r\n[432] For instance, the following sonnet:--\r\n\r\n        Yace tendido en la desierta arena,\r\n    Que quasi siempre el mar baña y esconde,\r\n    De Tirsi el cuerpo; el alma alverga donde\r\n    Sembrò Amor la simiente de su pena:\r\n        Alli miéntras su llanto amargo suena\r\n    Entre las peñas, Eco le responde:\r\n    Tirsi cuitado, donde estas? Por donde\r\n    Saldràs á ver tu luz pura e serena?\r\n        Aqui el cielo nubloso, el viento ayrado\r\n    Mantienen con el mar perpetua guerra,\r\n    Y él con estas montañas que rodea.\r\n        Ay de ti, Tirsi, de dolor cercado,\r\n    Mas que de mar, quando será que lea\r\n    Fili en tu frente lo que el pecho encierra.\r\n\r\n[433] A new edition of the best poems of Francisco de Figueroa was\r\npublished by Ramon Fernandez at Madrid, in 1785, in 8vo.\r\n\r\n[434] One of his Endechas commences thus:--\r\n\r\n        Bella Zagleja\r\n    del color moreno,\r\n    blanco milagroso\r\n    de mi pensamiento:\r\n        Gallarda trigueña,\r\n    de belleza extremo,\r\n    ardor de las almas,\r\n    y de amor troféo:\r\n        Suave Sirena,\r\n    que con tus acentos\r\n    detienes el curso\r\n    de los pasageros:\r\n        Desde que te ví\r\n    tal estoy que siento\r\n    preso el alvedrío,\r\n    y abrasado el pecho.\r\n\r\n[435] For example:--\r\n\r\n        De las Damas fantásticas,\r\n    mas que la caña móviles,\r\n    presos de amor en esta red amplífica,\r\n    seglares y monásticas\r\n    de baja suerte ignóbiles,\r\n    de muy oscura fama y muy clarífica,\r\n    que lengua tan manífica\r\n    dirá los echos frívolos,\r\n    vanidades gentílicas,\r\n    pues templos y Basílicas\r\n    pretenden como dioses estos ídolos,\r\n    Lucrecias y Cleópatras,\r\n    que hacen á los necios ser idólatras?\r\n\r\n[436] The following is one of his sonnets:--\r\n\r\n    Si pudo de Anfion el dulce canto\r\n        Juntar las piedras del Troyano muro,\r\n        Si con suave lira, oso seguro\r\n        Baxar el Tracio al Reyno del espanto;\r\n    Si la voz regalada pudo tanto,\r\n        Que abrio las puertas de diamante duro,\r\n        Y un rato suspendio de aquel escuro\r\n        Lugar la pena y miserable llanto;\r\n    Y si del canto la admirable fuerça\r\n        Domestica los fieros animales,\r\n        Y enfrena la corriente de los rios.\r\n    Que nueva pena en mi pesar se esfuerza,\r\n        Pues con lo que descrecen otros males,\r\n        Se van acrecentando mas los mios.\r\n\r\n[437] The collection is entitled--_Flores de Poetas ilustres de España,\r\n&c. ordenada por Pedro Espinosa_. _Valladolid_, 1605, in quarto. From\r\nthis anthology has been partly selected the specimens of the works of\r\nthose poets who have just been noticed. The rest of the examples are\r\nscattered through the _Parnaso Español_.\r\n\r\n[438] His Castilian and Portuguese poems are published under the\r\ntitle:--_Fuente de Aganippe, o Rimas varias de Manuel de Faria y\r\nSousa_, &c. Madrid 1656, 4 vols. octavo. They are also included in his\r\n_Divinas y Humanas Flores_, Madrid 1624, in octavo.\r\n\r\n[439] This absurdity occurs in a gloss on an old couplet.\r\n\r\n        Ojos, en cuya hermosura\r\n    cifrò mi suerte el Amor,\r\n    grandes como mi dolor,\r\n    negros como mi ventura.\r\n        En una hermosura de ojos\r\n    dixo Amor que me daria\r\n    a padecer sus enojos,\r\n    donde el Alma dexaria,\r\n    de su incendio, por despojos.\r\n        Pues si en la belleza pura\r\n    de ojos, mi muerte procura;\r\n    si en vos mis ojos no fue,\r\n    que soys de Albania, no se,\r\n    ojos, en cuya hermosura.\r\n        Quiso amor mostrarme ardiente\r\n    mi suerte en cifras algunas,\r\n    y vio de negro luziente\r\n    rayadas _dos medias lunas\r\n    en el papel de la frente_:\r\n    Y abaxo visto el valor,\r\n    ojos, de vuestro esplendor,\r\n    por ceros vino a teneros,\r\n    que en dos animados zeros\r\n    cifró mi suerte el Amor.\r\n\r\n[440] In the original this odd conceit runs in the following way:--\r\n\r\n        Flechando de sus manos peregrinas,\r\n    de cristal diez luzientes passadores,\r\n    _de rubi_ fue _el efeto_ en mis dolores,\r\n    si de Albania las _causas cristalinas_.\r\n        Mas ya que, _humanas, quando no divinas_,\r\n    en _sangrienta ofension_ forman amores,\r\n    de tantos _deificados esplendores_\r\n    desmentidos en nieve, y clavellinas.\r\n        Amor en mis heridas reparando,\r\n    _de flechas con dulcissimo decoro_,\r\n    a mi noble aficion la vá inclinando.\r\n        Yo de nuevo, aunque herido, me enamoro\r\n    de verle hermosamente estar flechando\r\n    _en blancos de diamante empleos deoro_.\r\n\r\n[441] His _Europa Portuguesa_, (a bombastic title for _Portugal\r\nEuropeano_) is a work which contains considerable information on the\r\nstatistics of Portugal.\r\n\r\n[442] The following, which is a description of Life in Madrid, may\r\nserve as a specimen of these satirical sonnets:--\r\n\r\n        Una vida bestial de encantamiento,\r\n    Harpias contra bolsas conjuradas,\r\n    Mil vanas pretensiones engañadas,\r\n    Por hablar un oidor, mover el viento;\r\n        Carrozas y lacayos, pages ciento,\r\n    Hábitos mil con virgenes espadas,\r\n    Damas parleras, cambios, embaxadas,\r\n    Caras posadas, trato fraudulento;\r\n        Mentiras arbitreras, Abogados,\r\n    Clerigos sobre mulas, como mulos,\r\n    Embustes, calles sucias, lodo eterno;\r\n        Hombres de guerra medio estropeados,\r\n    Titulos y lisonjas, disimulos,\r\n    Esto es Madrid, mejor dixera Infierno.\r\n\r\n[443] The following _Letrilla_ may be taken as a specimen of Gongora’s\r\nartificial style:--\r\n\r\n        Da bienes fortuna\r\n    Que no están escritos,\r\n    Quando pitos flautas,\r\n    Quando flautas pitos.\r\n        Quan diversas sendas\r\n    Se suelen seguir\r\n    En el repartir\r\n    Las honras y haciendas.\r\n        A unos dá encomiendas,\r\n    A otros sambenitos,\r\n    Quando pitos: &c.\r\n        A veces despoja\r\n    De choza y apero\r\n    Al mayor cabrero,\r\n    Y á quien se le antoja,\r\n    La cabra mas coja\r\n    Parió dos cabritos,\r\n    Quando pitos, &c.\r\n        Porque en una aldea\r\n    Un pobre mancebo\r\n    Hurtó solo un huebo,\r\n    A sol bambonea,\r\n    Y otro se pasea\r\n    Con cien mil delitos,\r\n    Quando, &c.\r\n\r\n[444] A charming little song by Gongora commences in the following\r\nmanner:--\r\n\r\n        Las flores del romero,\r\n    Niña Isabel,\r\n    Hoy son flores azules,\r\n    Mañana serán miel.\r\n        Zelosa estás la niña,\r\n    Zelosa estás de aquel,\r\n    Dichoso pues lo buscas,\r\n    Ciego, pues no te vé.\r\n        Ingrato pues te enoja,\r\n    Y confiado, pues\r\n    No se disculpa hoy\r\n    De lo que hizo ayer.\r\n        Enjugen esperanzas\r\n    Lo que lloras por él,\r\n    Que zelos entre aquellos\r\n    Que se han querido bien,\r\n    Hoy son flores azules, &c.\r\n\r\n[445] The poem commences as follows:--\r\n\r\n        Era del Año la Estacion florida,\r\n    En que el mentido Robador de Europa\r\n    (Media Luna las Armas de su Frente,\r\n    Y el Sol todos los Rayos de su Pelo)\r\n    Luciente honor del Cielo\r\n    En campos de Zafiro pace Estrellas\r\n    Quando el que ministrar podia la Copa\r\n    A Jupiter mejor, que el Garçon de Ida\r\n    Naufragò, y desdeñado sobre ausente,\r\n    Lagrimosas de Amor, dulzes Querellas\r\n    Dá al Mar, que condolido\r\n    Fue à las Hondas, que al Viento\r\n    El misero Gemido,\r\n    Segundo, de Arion, dulze Instrumento, &c.\r\n\r\nThe above is only about the half of the first period.\r\n\r\n[446] The singularity of the language must be perceptible even to\r\nthose who possess only a slight knowledge of Spanish. The dedication\r\ncommences as follows:--\r\n\r\n        Passos de un Peregrino, son, errante,\r\n    Quantos me dictó Versos, dulze Musa,\r\n    En Soledad confusa,\r\n    Perdidos unos y otros Inspirados,\r\n    O tu, que de venablos impedido,\r\n    Muros de Abeto, Almenas de Diamante,\r\n    Bates los Montes, que de Nieve armados\r\n    Gigantes de Cristal los teme el Cielo,\r\n    Donde el Cuerno del Eco repetido,\r\n    Fieras te expone, que al teñido Suelo\r\n    Muertas pidiendo Terminos disformes;\r\n    Espumoso Coral le dan al Tormes.\r\n\r\n[447] The two concluding stanzas of Gongora’s _Polyphemus_ are worthy\r\nto be transcribed as literary curiosities:--\r\n\r\n        Con Violencia desgajo infinita\r\n    La maior Punta de la excelsa Roca,\r\n    Que al Joven, sobre quien la precipita,\r\n    Urna es mucho, Piramide no poca:\r\n    Con lagrimas la Ninfa solicita\r\n    Las Diedades del Mar, que Acis invoca,\r\n    Concurren todas, y el Peñasco duro,\r\n    La Sangre que exprimiò Cristal fue puro.\r\n        Sus Miembros lastimosamente opresos,\r\n    Del Escollo fatal fueron apenas,\r\n    Que los Pies de los Arboles mas gruessos\r\n    Calçò el liquido Aljofar de sus Venas:\r\n    Corriente Plata al fin sus blancos Huesos,\r\n    Lamiendo Flores, y argentando Arenas,\r\n    A Doris llega, que con Llanto pio\r\n    Yerno lo saludò lo aclamò Rio.\r\n\r\n[448] Notices concerning the various editions of the works of Gongora,\r\nmay be found in Dieze’s Remarks on Velasquez, p. 251. A selection from\r\nthe works of this unsuccessful genius, whose real merit some critics\r\nhave attempted to deny, was published by Don Ramon Fernandez, under the\r\ntitle of _Poesias de D. Luis Gongora_, Madrid 1787. The selection forms\r\na small octavo volume.\r\n\r\n[449] Dieze calls the _estilo culto_ the Spanish ornamental style; but\r\nthis term is incorrect when employed to designate the particular style\r\nof Gongora’s school.\r\n\r\n[450] Among these illustrative works, are Salcedo Coronel’s diffuse\r\nCommentaries on Gongora’s _Polyphemus y Soledades_, printed in 1629 and\r\n1636; and also the _Lecciones solennes a las Obras de Luis de Gongora_,\r\nby Joseph Pellicer de Salas, which appeared in 1630. See also Dieze’s\r\nNotes.\r\n\r\n[451] The fifth volume of the _Parnaso Español_ is disfigured by a\r\nconsiderable number of Ladesma’s poems.\r\n\r\n[452] How pompously this poem commences in the original!--And yet how\r\nmuch in the romance style!\r\n\r\n        Sale la estrella de Oriente\r\n    al tiempo que Dios dispone\r\n    que el enemigo del dia\r\n    pierda la presa que coge,\r\n        Y con ella la esperanza\r\n    de sus falsas pretensiones,\r\n    tomando Dios carne humana,\r\n    para que el hombre le goce:\r\n        Por donde Santa Maria\r\n    recibe el famoso nombre\r\n    de ser Madre, siendo virgen,\r\n    de quien siendo Dios, es hombre.\r\n        Muy pobremente camina\r\n    con ser tan rico y tan noble,\r\n    que amores de cierta Dama\r\n    le traen en hábito de pobre; &c.\r\n\r\n[453] This rhapsody cannot be read without exciting astonishment.\r\n\r\n    Los _milagros de Amarilis_,\r\n        aquel _Angel superior_,\r\n        a quien dan nombre de _Fenix,\r\n        la verdad, y la passion_.\r\n    Mirava a su puerta un dia,\r\n        en la Corte un labrador,\r\n        que _si adorar no merece,\r\n        padecer si, mereciò.\r\n    Una tarde, que es mañana_,\r\n        pues _el Alva se riò_,\r\n        y entre carmin encendido,\r\n        candidas perlas mostró.\r\n    Divirtiose en abrasar\r\n        a los mismos que alumbrò,\r\n        y _del cielo de si misma\r\n        el Angel bello cayò, &c._\r\n\r\n[454] The _Gridonia_ is included in the _Obras Posthumas Divinas y\r\nHumanas de Don Felix de Arteaga_, Madrid 1641, 1 vol. octavo.\r\n\r\n[455] The collection which I have now before me, and which is entitled\r\n_Varios y Honestos Entretenimientos_, by Castillo Solorzano, (Mexico,\r\n1625, in octavo), was, apparently, not the only publication of the kind\r\nwhich appeared in Mexico.\r\n\r\n[456] Velasquez has occasioned no small degree of confusion in this\r\nportion of the history of Spanish poetry. He first, according to the\r\nprinciples of French criticism, confounds all the dramatic writers of\r\nSpain in one class, and afterwards draws wide distinctions between them.\r\n\r\n[457] _Obras Tragicas y Lyricas del Capitan Christoval de Virues_,\r\nMadrid 1609, in octavo. It does not appear that they have ever been\r\nre-printed.\r\n\r\n[458] The following monologue, in which Semiramis wavers between the\r\nconflicting passions of love and ambition, will afford a specimen of\r\nthe tragic style of Virues:--\r\n\r\n        Pero mis pensamientos amorosos\r\n    dexadme aora en paz, mientras la guerra\r\n    di mis altos desseos valerosos\r\n    hace temblar y estremecer la tierra.\r\n    Los filos azerados rigurosos\r\n    que en la baina mil años á que encierra\r\n    mi coraçon, dexad que aora corten,\r\n    que tiempo avra despues que se reporten.\r\n        Tiempo despues avra para gozarme\r\n    no con un Nino torpe i asqueroso,\r\n    tiempo tendre despues para emplearme\r\n    en un Zopiro dulce i amoroso,\r\n    tiempo tendre para desencerrarme\r\n    de un cautiverio infame i afrentoso\r\n    que à ya diez i seis años que en mi Reina\r\n    con titulo de Reina sin ser Reina.\r\n        Aora lo sere, no ai duda en ello,\r\n    aunque la tierra se rebuelva i hunda,\r\n    avra sacare del yugo el cuello\r\n    aunque Amon con sus rayos me confunda,\r\n    avra a mis desseos pondre el sello,\r\n    destas traças mi gozo i bien redunda,\r\n    de aqui sucederá, i sino sucede\r\n    cosa no avra que no intentada quede.\r\n\r\n[459] He says in his prologue:--\r\n\r\n        Yo creo que el mas alto i cierto amparo\r\n    que en todo el suelo tiene, está sin duda\r\n    aquí donde oi se aguarda la Tragedia\r\n    de la cruel Casandra, ya famosa\r\n    la cual tambien cortada a la medida\r\n    de exemplos de virtud (aunque mostrados\r\n    tal vez por su contrario el vicio) viene\r\n    acompañada con el dulce gusto,\r\n    _siguiendo en esto la mayor fineza\r\n    del arte antigo i del moderno uso_,\r\n    que jamas en Teatros Españoles\r\n    visto se aya, sin que a nadie agravie.\r\n\r\n[460] For example in the following scene. The prince is surprised by\r\nhis beloved Fulgencia, against whom he has been prepossessed by the\r\ntreacherous hypocrisy of Casandra:--\r\n\r\n    _Fulgenc._    La que sin ti Señor no quiere vida,\r\n                  no es mucha que no huya de la muerte\r\n                  que tu saña le tiene prometida\r\n                  osando, como ves, bolver a verte.\r\n                  Aqui me tienes a tus pies rendida.\r\n                  Si verme en tu presencia es ofenderte\r\n                  tanto que en mi executes lo jurado\r\n                  é aqui mi cuello al hierro aparejado.\r\n\r\n    _Princip._    Es ilusion, es sueño lo que veo\r\n                  i lo que oyo? que dezis Fulgencia?\r\n                  que novedad es esta a devaneo?\r\n                  tentaisme por ventura de paciencia?\r\n                  de vuestra muerte tengo yo desseo?\r\n\r\n    _Casand._     i a mi me à de ofender vuestra presencia?\r\n                  i yo é jurado cosa en vuestro daño?\r\n                  venis dezi con algun nuevo engaño?\r\n                      Basta pues el passado con que el Conde\r\n                  quisistes poner mal comigo tanto,\r\n                  la verdad es un Sol que no de esconde.\r\n                  De vuestro aviso y discrecion me espanto, &c.\r\n\r\n[461] _Para Todos, Exemplos morales, humanos y divinos, en que se\r\ntratan diversas Ciencias, &c. por el Doctor Juan Perez de Montalvan_,\r\nin quarto. In the copy which I have seen, the date of the year on the\r\ntitle-page is obliterated.\r\n\r\n[462] The historical drama, in which Montalvan has drawn the character\r\nof Philip II. bears the affected title of _El segundo Seneca de\r\nEspaña_. The second Seneca, here alluded to, is no other than Philip\r\nhimself. Montalvan has, on the contrary, described the Infant Don\r\nCarlos as a noisy blusterer. Philip summons Carlos to his presence in\r\norder to correct him:--\r\n\r\n    _Rey._  Yo tengo pocas razones,\r\n            pero tengo muchos manos,\r\n            y al passo que sé quereros\r\n            sabre tambien castigaros.\r\n            Vuestras locas travesuras\r\n            me secaron de mi passo,\r\n            que aun una cuerda torcida,\r\n            si la tiran mucho al arco,\r\n            parece que se querella,\r\n            y se buelve contra el braço.\r\n            Entendeisme?\r\n\r\n    _Pr._                Si Señor.\r\n\r\n    _R._    Pues procurad de enmendaros,\r\n            que os pesarâ de no hazerlo,\r\n            si, por la vida de entrambos.\r\n\r\n(_Levantase furioso, y quierese ir._)\r\n\r\n    _Pr._   Fuego por los ojos echa.\r\n            Vive Dios que le he temblado,\r\n            pero no importa. Señor!\r\n\r\n    _Rey._  Que quereis?\r\n\r\n    _Pr._   A no enojaros\r\n            el escucharme, yo os diera\r\n            por mi parte tal descargo,\r\n            que con vos quedara bien,\r\n            puesto que estais enojado.\r\n\r\n    _R._    Antes me hareis un gran gusto,\r\n            por disculparme en amaros.\r\n\r\nPhilip then continues to admonish Don Carlos in a pompous tone of\r\nsuppressed ill humour.\r\n\r\n[463] The comedy in which the character of Henry IV. appears, is\r\nentitled _El Mariscalo de Viron_. Henry and Marshal de Biron are\r\nrivals in a love affair. The Marshal, with the frankness of a soldier,\r\nconfesses his attachment for the lady, and Henry relinquishes his suit.\r\n“And did this give you so much concern?” says Henry to the Marshal.\r\n\r\n    _Marisc._    Esta es mi confusion.\r\n\r\n    _Rey._       Y esso os tenia afligido?\r\n\r\n    _Mar._       Claro esta porque naci\r\n                 inferior y vos aqui\r\n                 sois mi Rey.\r\n\r\n    _Rey._                    Vos los aveis sido\r\n                 para mi en mí voluntad,\r\n                 como aora lo vereis:\r\n                 ya, Blanca, dueño teneis.\r\n\r\n    _Blan._      De que manera?\r\n\r\n    _Rey._                      Escuchad\r\n                 Carlos, quanto a lo primero\r\n                 os aviso, que no es ley,\r\n                 que un vasallo con su Rey\r\n                 hable nunca tan entero.\r\n                 Porque se deve advertir,\r\n                 que el Rey se puede enojar,\r\n                 y enojada, hazer baxar\r\n                 al mismo que hizo subir.\r\n                 Vos aqui me aveis hablado\r\n                 con alguna sequedad:\r\n                 pero mi gran voluntad\r\n                 el yerro os ha perdonado.\r\n                 Que nunca para consigo\r\n                 amigo se ha de dezir\r\n                 al que no sabe sufrir\r\n                 alguna falta a su amigo:\r\n                 yo lo soy vuestro, y ansi\r\n                 (aunque à Blanca amando estoy)\r\n                 licencia de amarla os doy,\r\n                 y servirla desde aqui.\r\n\r\n[464] But these autos are included in the _Para Todos_. See note, page\r\n447.\r\n\r\n[465] _Relaciones de la vida del escudero Marcos de Obregon, &c. por el\r\nMaestro Vicente Espinel_; Barcelona, 1618, in octavo.\r\n\r\n[466] See page 414.\r\n\r\n[467] _Primera parte de la vida del Picaro Guzman de Alfarache,\r\ncompuesta por Mattheo Aleman. Brussel._ 1604, in 8vo. is the title of\r\nthe oldest edition that I have seen. The words _Primera parte_ have\r\nreference to the Continuation, which is the production of another\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\n[468] Besides those which are included in his _Para todas_, a separate\r\ncollection was published under the title of _Succesos y prodigios\r\nde Amor, en ocho novelas exemplares, por el Doctor Juan Perez de\r\nMontalvan_. The sixth edition (that with which I am acquainted), was\r\npublished at Seville in 1633, in 4to.\r\n\r\n[469] Those who wish to find a catalogue of Spanish novels and romances\r\nof middling and inferior merit, must turn to Blankenburg, who, in\r\nhis appendix to Sulzer’s article _Erzählung_, enumerates them at\r\nconsiderable length. The list might be augmented by an examination of\r\nthe collection of novels and romances in the library of the University\r\nof Göttingen.\r\n\r\n[470] A new edition of the _Novelas entretenidas, compuestas por Doña\r\nMariana de Caravajal y Saavedra_, was published at Madrid so late as\r\nthe year 1728.\r\n\r\n[471] In Spanish this phrase has a comical effect:--_Entretenimientos\r\nen que divertas las perezosas noches del erizado invierno_.\r\n\r\n[472] She says:--Admitas mi voluntad, perdonando los defectos de\r\nuna _tan mal cortada pluma_, en la qual hallaras mayores _deseos de\r\nservirte con doze comedias_, en que _conoscas lo affectuoso de mi\r\ndeseo_.\r\n\r\n[473] Mariana wrote as early as the reign of Charles V. and he died in\r\nthe year 1623, in the ninetieth year of his age.\r\n\r\n[474] The title is:--_Joannis Marianæ Historiæ, de rebus Hispaniæ,\r\nlibri triginta_. It has been frequently printed; and there is one very\r\nelegant edition in large folio, _Hagae Comitum_ 1731. The Spanish\r\nnames of persons and places are, however, latinized in a manner so\r\nartificial, as to render them no less unintelligible than the names in\r\nCardinal Bembo’s History.\r\n\r\n[475] There is a beautiful edition of this historical work, published\r\nby patriotic subscription, in a series of small folio volumes, under\r\nthe following title:--_Historia general de España, que escribiò el P.\r\nJuan de Mariana, &c._ Valencia, 1785.\r\n\r\n[476] The subjoined extract, which affords a specimen of Mariana’s\r\nhistorical style, is the commencement of his description of the battle,\r\nwhich was lost by King Roderick in conflict with the Arabs, and which\r\nwas followed by the overthrow of the gothic monarchy:--\r\n\r\nEl movido del peligro y daño, y encendido en deseo de tomar emienda\r\nde lo pasado y de vengarse, apellidó todo el reyno. Mandó que todos\r\nlos que fuesen de edad, acudiesen á las banderas. Amenazó con graves\r\ncastigos á los que lo contrario hiciesen. Juntóse á este llamamiento\r\ngran número de gente: los que menos cuentan, dicen fueron pasados\r\nde cien mil combatientes. Pero con la larga paz, como acontece,\r\nmostrábanse ellos alegres y bravos, blasonaban y aun renegaban;\r\nmas eran cobardes á maravilla, sin esfuerzo y aun sin fuerzas para\r\nsufrir los trabajos y incomodidades de la guerra. La mayor parte iban\r\ndesarmados, con hondas solamente ó bastones. Este fue el exército con\r\nque el Rey marchó la vuelta del Andalucía. Llegó por sus jornadas\r\ncerca de Xerez, donde el enemigo estaba alojado. Asentó sus reales y\r\nfortificólos en un llano por la parte que pasa el rio Guadalete. Los\r\nunos y los otros deseaban grandemente venir á las manos; los Moros\r\norgullosos con la victoria; los Godos por vengarse, por su patria,\r\nhijos, mugeres y libertad no dudaban poner á riesgo las vidas, sin\r\nembargo que gran parte dellos sentian en sus corazones una tristeza\r\nextraordinaria, y un silencio qual suele caer á las veces como presagio\r\ndel mal que ha de venir sobre algunos. _Lib._ vi. _cap._ 23.\r\n\r\n[477] The surname Villegas has given rise to many blunders respecting\r\nQuevedo and the celebrated Estèban Manuel de Villegas. A good abstract\r\nof the various biographical notices of Quevedo is prefixed to the\r\nfourth volume of the _Parnaso Español_.\r\n\r\n[478]\r\n\r\n    Verdades diré en camisa,\r\n    Poco menos que desnudas.\r\n\r\n[479] These canciones and romances are contained in the great\r\ncollection of the poems of Quevedo, published by the Gongorist Gonzales\r\nde Salas, under the Gongoristic title of _El Parnaso Español, Monte en\r\ndos cumbres dividido_, (that is to say, in two volumes.) A new, but\r\nvery far from elegant, edition of this collection of Quevedo’s poems\r\nappeared at Madrid, in 1729, in quarto. It is divided into books, each\r\nof which bears the name of one of the muses.\r\n\r\n[480] For example, in the following song to a linnet, which is\r\ndescribed as a singing and flying flower:--\r\n\r\n    _Flor que cantas, flor que buelas_\r\n        Y tienes por _facistol_\r\n        _El laurel_, para que al Sol,\r\n        Con tan _sonoras cautelas_,\r\n        Le madrugas, y desuelas,\r\n        Digas mè,\r\n        Dulce Gilguero, por què?\r\n    Dime, _Cantor Ramillete,\r\n        Lyra de pluma volante,\r\n        Silvo alado_, y elegante,\r\n        Que en el rizado copete\r\n        Luces flor, suenas falsete,\r\n        Porque _cantas_ con porfia\r\n        _Embidias, que llora el dia_,\r\n        Con lagrimas de la Aurora\r\n        Si en la risa de Lidora\r\n        Su amanecer desconsuelas,\r\n        Flor que cantas, flor que buelas, &c.\r\n\r\n[481] For example, in the following song, which passes from one style\r\nto another:--\r\n\r\n    Pero siendo tu en la Villa\r\n        Dama, de demanda, y trote,\r\n        Bien puede ser que del mote,\r\n        No ayas visto la cartilla.\r\n        Vá de el estilo que brilla\r\n        _En la Culterana Prosa,\r\n        Grecizante, y Latinosa_:\r\n        Mucho serà si me entiendes,\r\n        Yo vacio pyras, y asciendes,\r\n        Culto và Señora hermosa.\r\n    Si bien _el palor ligustre\r\n        Desfallece los candores_,\r\n        Quando muchos esplendores\r\n        Conduce à poco _palustre,\r\n        Construye al aroma ilustre_\r\n        Victima de tanto culto,\r\n        Presentiendo de tu vulto,\r\n        Que rayos fulmina horrendo;\r\n        _Ni me entiendes, ni te entiendo,\r\n        Pues catate, que soy culto_.\r\n\r\n[482] A specimen of this gypsey gibberish may be curious to those who\r\nare not acquainted with it:--\r\n\r\n    Ya està guardando en la trena\r\n        Tu querido Escarraman,\r\n        Que unos alfileres vivos,\r\n        Me prendieron sin pensar.\r\n    Andaba à caza de gangas,\r\n        Y grillos vine à cazar,\r\n        Que en mi cantan como enhaza,\r\n        Las noches de por San Juan.\r\n    Entrandome en la bayuca,\r\n        Llegandome à remojar\r\n        Cierta pendencia mosquito,\r\n        Que se ahogò en vino, y pan.\r\n\r\n[483] A new collection of this kind of gypsey romances, was published\r\nat Madrid in 1779, in octavo, under the title of Romances de\r\n_Germania_. _Germania_ is the Spanish name for the gypsey race.\r\n\r\n[484] For example, one in which a young married man, on the third day\r\nafter his nuptials, asks his spouse, how many years a man daily grows\r\nolder in the matrimonial state?\r\n\r\n    Antiyer nos casamos, oy querria,\r\n        Doña Perez, saber ciertas verdades;\r\n        Decidme, quanto numero de edades\r\n        Enfunda el matrimonio en solo un dia?\r\n    Un antiyer soltero ser solia,\r\n        Y oy casado un sin fin de Navidades\r\n        Han puesto dos marchitas voluntaries\r\n        Y mas de mil antaños en la mia.\r\n    Esto de ser marido un año arreo,\r\n        Aun à los azacanes empalaga;\r\n        Todo lo cotidiano es mucho, y feo.\r\n\r\n[485] See the collection of Salas, Musa II. &c.\r\n\r\n[486] This appears in the commencement of the following extract.\r\n\r\n    No he de callar, por mas que con el dedo,\r\n        Yà tocando la boca, ò y á la frente,\r\n        Silencio, avises, ò amenaces miedo.\r\n    No ha de aver un espiritu valiente?\r\n        Siempre se ha de sentir, lo que se dice?\r\n        Nunca se ha de decir, lo que se siente?\r\n    Oy sin miedo, que libre escandalice,\r\n        Puede hablar al ingenio, assegurado\r\n        De que mayor poder le atemorice.\r\n    En otros siglos pudo ser pecado\r\n        Severo estudio, y la verdad desnuda,\r\n        Y romper el silencio el bien hablado.\r\n    Pues sepa quien lo niega, y quien lo duda,\r\n        Que es lengua la Verdad de Dios severo,\r\n        Y la lengua de Dios nunca fue muda.\r\n    Son la verdad, y Dios, Dios verdadero.\r\n        Ni eternidad divina los separa,\r\n        Ni de los dos alguno fue primero.\r\n    Si Dios à la verdad se adelantàra,\r\n        Siendo verdad, implicacion huviera\r\n        En ser, y en que verdad de ser dexàra.\r\n\r\n[487] He earnestly condemns the Spanish imitation of the Arabian\r\ntournaments with pointed canes.\r\n\r\n    Quexosa es vèr un Infazon de España,\r\n        Abreviado en la silla à la gineta,\r\n        Y gastar un cavallo en una caña?\r\n    Que la niñez al gollo le acometa\r\n        Con semejante municion, apruebo;\r\n        Mas no la edad madura, la perfeta.\r\n    Exercite sus fuercas el mancebo\r\n        Enfrentes de esquadrones; no en la frente\r\n        De el util bruto el hasta de el acebo.\r\n    El trompete le llama diligente,\r\n        Dando fuerza de ley el viento vano,\r\n        Y al son estè el exercito obediente.\r\n    Con quanta magestad llena la mano\r\n        La pica, y el mosquete carga el ombro,\r\n        De el que se atreve á ser buen Castellano.\r\n\r\n[488] Quevedo’s _Sueños_, or Visions, which are now translated into\r\nalmost every cultivated language in Europe, were shortly after their\r\nappearance, introduced into German literature by Moscherosch von\r\nWilstedt, under the title of _Gesichte Philanders von Sittewald_. The\r\nromance of the Great Tacaño has also been translated into various\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n[489] Pero lo que mas me espantò, fue de ver los cuerpos de dos o tres\r\nmercadores, que se havian vestido las almas de revès, y tenian todos\r\nlos cinco sentidos en las uñas de la mana derecha. _Sueño del Juizio\r\nfinal, o de las Calaveras._\r\n\r\n[490] An elegant edition of these poems was published by Luis Joseph\r\nVelasquez, the author of the History of Spanish Poetry, under the title\r\nof--_Poesias que publicò Dr. Francisco de Quevedo Villegas con el\r\nnombre de Bachiller Franc. de la Torre_, &c. Madrid, 1753, in quarto.\r\nVelasquez has proved Quevedo to be the author of these compositions.\r\n\r\n[491] For example:--\r\n\r\n        Bella es mi Ninfa, si los lazos de oro\r\n    al apacible viento desordena:\r\n    bella si de sus ojos enagena\r\n    el altivo desdèn que siempre lloro.\r\n        Bella, si con la luz que sola adoro\r\n    la tempestad del viento, y mar serena:\r\n    bella, si à la dureza de mi pena\r\n    buelve las gracias del celeste Coro.\r\n        Bella, si mansa, bella si terrible,\r\n    bella si cruda, bella esquiva, y bella\r\n    si buelve grave aquella luz del Cielo.\r\n        Cuya beldad humana, y apacible,\r\n    ni se puede saber lo que es sin vella,\r\n    ni vista entenderà la que es el suelo.\r\n\r\n[492] The commencement of one of these Endechas may be transcribed as\r\na specimen:--\r\n\r\n        Corona del Cielo,\r\n    Ariadna bella,\r\n    conocida estrella\r\n    del nocturno velo,\r\n    Tù sola del coro\r\n    de las lumbres bellas,\r\n    oye mis querellas,\r\n    pues tus males lloro.\r\n    Tù fuiste querida,\r\n    y olvidada fuiste,\r\n    yo querido, y triste,\r\n    quien me amò, me olvida.\r\n\r\n[493] The style of the following appears unobjectionable:--\r\n\r\n    Esta por ser, ò Lisi, la primera\r\n        Flor, que ha ossado fiar de los calores,\r\n        Recien nacïdas joyas, y colores,\r\n        Aventurando el precio à la ribera:\r\n    Esta, que estudio fue à la Primavera,\r\n        Y en quien se anticiparon esplendores.\r\n        De el Sol, será primicia de las flores,\r\n        Y culto, con que la alma te venera.\r\n    A corta vida nace destinada,\r\n        Sus edades son horas: en un dia\r\n        Su parto, y muerte el Cielo rie, y llora.\r\n    Logrese en tu cabello respetada\r\n        De el año, no malogre lo que cria,\r\n        Aqueta en larga vida, eterna Aurora.\r\n\r\n[494] The following is on modern Rome:--\r\n\r\n    Buscas en Roma à Roma, ó Peregrino,\r\n        Y en Roma misma à Roma no la hallas.\r\n        Cadaver son, las que ostentò murallas,\r\n        Y Tumba de sì proprio el Aventino.\r\n    Yaze donde reynaba el Palatino,\r\n        Y limadas del tiempo las medallas,\r\n        Mas se muestran destrozo á las batallas\r\n        De las edades, que Blason Latino.\r\n    Solo el Tiber quedò, cuya corriente,\r\n        Si ciudad la regò, yà sepoltura\r\n        La llora con funesto son doliente.\r\n    O Roma, en tu grandeza, en tu hermosura\r\n        Huyò lo que era firme, y solamente\r\n        Lo fugitive permanece, y dura.\r\n\r\n[495] For example, the following, which is addressed to Astræa:--\r\n\r\n    Arroja las balanzas, sacra Astrea,\r\n        Pues que tienen tu mano embarazada;\r\n        Y si se mueven, tiemblan de tu espada,\r\n        Que el peso, y la igualdad no las menea.\r\n    No estàs justificada, sino fea;\r\n        Y en vez de estàr igual, estàs armada;\r\n        Feroz te vé la gente, no ajustada;\r\n        Quieres que el tribunal batalla sea?\r\n    Yà militan las Leyes, y el Derecho,\r\n        Y te sirven de textos las heridas,\r\n        Que escrive nuestra sangre en nuestro pecho.\r\n    La parca eres fatal para las vidas,\r\n        Pues lo que hilaron otras, has deshecho,\r\n        Y has buelto las balanzas homicidas.\r\n\r\n[496] This may probably account for its insertion in the second volume\r\nof the _Parnaso Español_.\r\n\r\n[497] The third book of the first division of these poems, is dedicated\r\nto Fernandez de Velasco, the constable of Castile. In the dedicatory\r\nverses Villegas says:--\r\n\r\n    Mis dulces cantilenas,\r\n    Mis suaves delicias,\r\n    _A los viente limadas,\r\n    A los cotorce escritas, &c._\r\n\r\n[498] The edition which I have seen, is entitled, _Amatorias de D.\r\nEsteban Manuel de Villegas_. It is printed at Naxera, and on the\r\ntitle-page bears the date of 1620, and on the final page 1617.\r\n\r\n[499]\r\n\r\n    Assi las hebras, que en el alma adoro,\r\n    Del Zefiro movidas,\r\n    Daran mil muertes, venceran mil vidas.\r\n\r\n[500]\r\n\r\n    Ni el mismo Sol resplandecer pudiera,\r\n    Si de tu roja frente\r\n    No hurtara rayos, para darle al Oriente.\r\n\r\n[501] In this ode Villegas says:--\r\n\r\n        No aspiro a mas laureles que a mi llama:\r\n    que offende a sus deseos, quien bien ama:\r\n    siga el joven valiente\r\n    en polverosa meta carro ardiente,\r\n    i el, de todos servido,\r\n    feliz privado, a rei agradecido;\r\n    siga de noche, i dia\r\n    por la campaña umbria\r\n    el caçador ligero\r\n    al xavalì cerdoso,\r\n    ya siendo monteado, ya montero.\r\n    Siga por mar i tierra el belicoso\r\n    varon, la dura guerra,\r\n    i en mar sea delfin, i tigre en tierra.\r\n        Que yo, de alagos tiernos persuadido,\r\n    seguir tengo las llamas de Cupido,\r\n    seguir tengo los fuegos,\r\n    adestrado de locos, i de ciegos.\r\n\r\n[502] For example, the following stanzas:--\r\n\r\n        O quan dulce, i suave\r\n    es ver al campo, quando mas recrea:\r\n    en el se quexa el ave,\r\n    el viento el spira, agua lisongea,\r\n    i las pintadas flores\r\n    crian mil vìsos, paren mil olores.\r\n        El alamo, i el pino\r\n    sirven de estorbos a la luz de Febo.\r\n    Brinda el baso contino\r\n    del claro arroyo con aljofar nuevo,\r\n    i la tendida grama\r\n    mesa a la gula es, i al sueño cama.\r\n        Tu solamente bella\r\n    nos haces falta, Tyndarias graciosa,\r\n    i si tu blanca hicella\r\n    no te nos presta como el alva hermosa,\r\n    lo dulce i lo suave\r\n    quan amargo sera, quan duro, i grave, &c.\r\n\r\n[503] One of these odes commences in the following comic style:--\r\n\r\n        Entanto pues, hermosa casadilla,\r\n    que los dos al pavon i tortolilla\r\n    imitamos fielmente,\r\n    tu con belleça, i yo con voz doliente:\r\n    mi voz de tu belleça\r\n    cante, qual cisne en su mayor tristeça:\r\n    pues por ti mi deseo\r\n    es musico suave mas que Orfeo.\r\n        Cante el heroico al son de la trompeta\r\n    el subito rumor de la escopeta,\r\n    i el tragico celêbre\r\n    calçado de Cothurno, accion funêbre:\r\n    que yo de ti, casada,\r\n    lyrico siendo, en cythara templada\r\n    cantarê solamente\r\n    tu voca, i ojos, tu mexilla, i frente, &c.\r\n\r\n[504] For example in the song (for an ode it is not) in which the\r\nconcluding line of each stanza is repeated as a burthen.\r\n\r\n        Jurò, que me seria\r\n    en amarme tan firme como roca,\r\n    o como robre essento:\r\n    i que atras volveria\r\n    este arroyuelo, que estas hayas toca,\r\n    antes que el juramento:\r\n    pero ya la perjura\r\n    cortar el arbol de mi fè procura.\r\n    Este diran los vientos,\r\n    que dieron a su jura las orejas:\r\n    esto diran los rios,\r\n    que por estar atentos\r\n    el susurro enfrenaron a sus quexas:\r\n    pero los llantos mios\r\n    diran, que la perjura\r\n    cortar el arbol de mi fè procura.\r\n\r\n[505] One commences thus:--\r\n\r\n        Luego que por oriente\r\n    muestra su blanca frente\r\n    el alba, que aporfia\r\n    sano nos muestra el dia,\r\n    i a la tarde doliente:\r\n    veras salir las aves,\r\n    ya ligeras, ya graves,\r\n    i ya libres del sueño\r\n    esclavas a su dueño\r\n    dar canticos suaves:\r\n    las Auras distraìdas,\r\n    que soplan esparcìdas\r\n    por selvas no plantadas,\r\n    o se mueven paradas,\r\n    o se paran movìdas, &c.\r\n\r\n[506] The following contains an exquisite picture of the grief of a\r\nbird for the loss of her young:--\r\n\r\n        Yo vi sobre un tomillo\r\n    quexarse un paxarillo\r\n    viendo su nido amado,\r\n    de quien era caudillo,\r\n    de un labrador robado.\r\n    Vìle tan congojado\r\n    por tal atrevimiento\r\n    dar mil quexas al viento\r\n    para que al cielo santo\r\n    lleve su tierno llanto,\r\n    lleve su triste acento,\r\n    yà con triste harmonia\r\n    esforçando al intento\r\n    mil quexas repitia:\r\n    ya cansando callava:\r\n    y al nuevo sentimiento\r\n    ya sonòro volvia.\r\n    Ya circular volaba:\r\n    ya rastrero corria:\r\n    ya pues de rama en rama\r\n    al rùstico seguia,\r\n    i saltando en la grama,\r\n    parece que decia:\r\n    dame, rùstico fiero,\r\n    mi dulce compañìa!\r\n    Yoì qué respondia\r\n    el rùstico: _No quiero_.\r\n\r\n[507] The subjoined passage presents a specimen of the affectation of\r\nthe Estilo Culto:--\r\n\r\n      Los ciento, que dio passòs, bella dama,\r\n    los mil, que dio suspiros, tierno rio,\r\n    siendo ella esquiva, mas que al Sol su rama,\r\n    i el, mas que el Sol, amante a su desvio:\r\n    yo cantarè, que amor mi pecho inflama,\r\n    i no de Marte el plomo, cuyo brio\r\n    en el vaciado bronce, resonante\r\n    vengança es ya de Jupiter tonante.\r\n\r\n[508] See the first volume of the History of Italian Poetry and\r\nEloquence, p. 50.\r\n\r\n[509] Villegas has thus translated one of Virgil’s idyls into Spanish\r\nhexameters:--\r\n\r\n        Lycidas, Corydon, i Corydon el amante de Philis,\r\n    Pastor el uno de cabras, el otro de blancas ovejas,\r\n    ambos a dos tiernos, moços ambos, Arcades ambos,\r\n    viendo que los rayos del sol fatigaban el orbe,\r\n    i que bibrando fuego feroz la canicula ladra,\r\n    al puro christal, que cria la fuente sonóra,\r\n    llevados del son alegre de su blando susurro,\r\n    las plantas veloces mueven, los passos animan,\r\n    i al tronce de un verde enebro se sientan amigos, &c.\r\n\r\n[510] The following are intended for hexameters and pentameters:--\r\n\r\n    Como el monte sigues a Diana, dixo Cytherea,\r\n        Dictyna hermosa, siendo la caça fea?\r\n    No me la desprecias Cyprida, responde Diana,\r\n        Tu tambien fuiste caça, la red lo diga.\r\n\r\n[511] It is an ode to Zephyr:--\r\n\r\n    Dulce vecino de la verde selva,\r\n    huesped eterno del Abril florido,\r\n    vital aliento de la madre Venus,\r\n        Zephyro blando,\r\n    Si de mis ansias el amor supiste,\r\n    tù, que las quejas de mi voz llevaste,\r\n    oye, no temas, i a mi Nympha dile,\r\n        dile que muero.\r\n    Philis un tiempo mi dolor sabia,\r\n    Philis un tiempo mi dolor lloraba,\r\n    quisome un tiempo, mas agora temo,\r\n        temo sus iras; &c.\r\n\r\n[512] The stanzas, in which the arrival of Orpheus at the Acheron\r\nis related, may serve as a specimen of Jauregui’s talent for poetic\r\ndescription:--\r\n\r\n        Llega á Aqueronte, y en su orilla espera,\r\n    Las cuerdas requiriendo y consultando:\r\n    Vè la grosera barca, à la ribera\r\n    Opuesta conducir copioso bando:\r\n    Del instrumento, y de la voz esmera\r\n    De nuevo entonces el acento blando;\r\n    Gime la cuerda al rebatir del arco,\r\n    Y su gemido es remora del barco.\r\n        Resonò en la ribera tiempo escaso\r\n    El canto que humanar las piedras suele;\r\n    Quando atrás vuelve, y obedece el vaso\r\n    Mas á la voz, que al remo que le impele;\r\n    La conducida turba, al nuevo caso,\r\n    Se admira, se regala, se conduele,\r\n    Y las réprobas almas, con aliento,\r\n    Se juzgan revocadas del tormento.\r\n\r\n    _Orfeo_, Cant. II.\r\n\r\n[513] The following is a sonnet of Jauregui addressed to the rising\r\nsun:--\r\n\r\n    Rubio Planeta, cuya lumbre pura\r\n        del tiempo mide cada punto, i ora,\r\n        si el bello objeto, que mi pecho adora\r\n        solo le gozo entre la noche oscura;\r\n    Por què ya se adelanta, i se apresura\r\n        tu luz injusta, i el Oriente dora?\r\n        las sonbras alexando de la Aurora,\r\n        i con las sonbras mi feliz ventura?\r\n    Diràs que el dulce espacio defraudado\r\n        ya de la noche, me daràs el dia,\r\n        tal que de vida un punto no me devas.\r\n    Sì deves (causa del ausencia mia)\r\n        que es vida solo el tiempo que me llevas;\r\n        i el que me ofreces un mortal cuidado.\r\n\r\n[514] Jauregui’s translation of Lucan was published, together with his\r\n_Orfeo_, under the title of _Pharsalia de D. Juan de Jauregui, por D.\r\nRamon Fernandez, Madrid_, 1789, in 2 vols. 8vo. The other poetic works\r\nof this author, including his translation of the Amynta, are collected\r\nin the _Rimas de D. Juan de Jauregui, Sevilla, 1618, in quarto_.\r\n\r\n[515] The name of this poet is of Italian origin. He was descended from\r\na branch of the Italian house of _Borgia_, and married the heiress of\r\nthe principality of _Squillace_ in Naples. Both names were, according\r\nto Spanish custom, hispanized, first in the pronunciation, and\r\nsubsequently in the orthography.\r\n\r\n[516] I have seen only the second edition of the _Obras in verso de D.\r\nFrancisco de Borja, Principe de Esquillache, Amberes_, 1654, 692 pages,\r\nquarto. Some of his poems are contained in the _Parnaso Español_.\r\n\r\n[517] He thus addresses his poems:--\r\n\r\n        A manos de muchos vais,\r\n    Versos mios, sin defensa,\r\n    Y sujetos a la ofensa\r\n    De quien menos la esperais.\r\n    Y si en tal peligro estais,\r\n    Injustamente me animan\r\n    Los que piden que os impriman;\r\n    _Pues quando luzir pretenden,\r\n    Si oscuros son, no se entienden,\r\n    Y si claros, no se estiman_.\r\n    El que sabe, estimarà,\r\n    Si algun estudio teneis:\r\n    A mas gloria no aspireis;\r\n    Ni mas el tiempo os darà.\r\n    _Quien defenderos podrà,\r\n    Serà quando mas, alguno;\r\n    Y si es Platon, basta èl uno._\r\n    Que en las frases y en los modos\r\n    Querer contentar a todos,\r\n    Es no agradar a ninguno.\r\n\r\n[518] He characterizes his own style as follows:--\r\n\r\n        _Sigo un medio en la jornada,\r\n    Y de mis versos despido,\r\n    O palabras de ruido,\r\n    O llaneza demasiada;\r\n    Y oscuridad afectada._\r\n    Es camino de atajar\r\n    No saberse declarar;\r\n    Ya quien se deve admitir,\r\n    Estudie para escrivir,\r\n    No escrive para estudiar.\r\n\r\n[519] For example, the following, which may be styled the\r\nDisenchantment, (_Desengaño_.)\r\n\r\n    Dichosa soledad, mudo silencio,\r\n        Secretos passos de dormidas fuentes,\r\n        Que por el verde prado sus corrientes,\r\n        Jamas, si van ò vienen diferencio:\r\n    Vuestra quietud estimo, y reverencio\r\n        Con ojos, y deseos diferentes;\r\n        Pues ya, ni el ciego aplauso de las gentes\r\n        Con ambiciosa pluma diligencio.\r\n    Desde la luz, que viste la mañana,\r\n        Los passos cuento al trabajado dia,\r\n        Hasta que pisa el Sol la espuma cana.\r\n    De quanto fue mi engaño, y compañia,\r\n        De quanto amè, con ignorancia vana,\r\n        En vuestra soledad perdì la mia.\r\n\r\n[520] Even the commencement of this poem, except in so far as regards\r\nthe diction, encourages no favourable expectation:--\r\n\r\n    Canto a Jacob, y de su Esposa canto\r\n        La peregrina angelica hermosura:\r\n        Siete años de fineza, amor y llanto,\r\n        Sin premio, sin verdad, y sin ventura:\r\n        El engañoso Suegro, que entretanto\r\n        Con fingida esperanza le assegura,\r\n        Y al burlado pastor, que le servia,\r\n        Promesas de Raquel cumple con Lia.\r\n    Tu, Musa celestial, que en las estrellas\r\n        Segura pones invisibles plantas,\r\n        Y en dulce paz de sus legiones bellas,\r\n        Sobre las altas fuentes te lebantas:\r\n        Si es tuyo el mando, si obedecen ellas\r\n        De essas puras esquadras sacrosantas,\r\n        Presto descienda de su rayo ardiente\r\n        Fuego, que el pecho y su temor aliente.\r\n\r\n[521] Part of one of these poems may be transcribed here:--\r\n\r\n        Llamavan los pajarillos\r\n    Con dulces voces al Sol,\r\n    Que por aver quien le llama,\r\n    Mal dormido recordò.\r\n        Escuchava entre las aves\r\n    De un arroyuelo la voz,\r\n    Que agradecido a su lumbre,\r\n    La bien venida le diò.\r\n        Entre las ramas de un olmo\r\n    Le acompaña un ruiseñor,\r\n    Enamorado testigo\r\n    De quantas vezes saliò.\r\n        _Yo sola triste al son\r\n    De todos lloro soledad, y amor._\r\n        En el valle de mi aldea\r\n    Zelosa aguardando estoy,\r\n    Que salga un Sol a mis ojos,\r\n    Que en otros braços dormiò.\r\n        Montes dezidle, que siento\r\n    De los males el mayor,\r\n    Si como al padra del dia\r\n    Le veis primero que yo; &c.\r\n\r\n[522] It is only necessary to refer to Velasquez and Dieze.\r\n\r\n[523] It is not now necessary to refer to the old and desultory\r\ncollections of the works of Count Rebolledo. They may be found\r\ncollected altogether under their respective titles in the edition of\r\nthe _Obras Poeticas de Conde Bernardino de Rebolledo, Madrid_, 1778,\r\nin 4 vols. octavo. In this collection the interesting letter in prose,\r\n(Part I. in the _Ocios_ p. 261), in which Rebolledo gives a detailed\r\naccount of his residence in Copenhagen, is deserving of particular\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n[524] The three following afford fair specimens of his talent in this\r\nspecies of composition:--\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n    Dichoso quien te mira\r\n      y mas dichoso quien por tì suspira,\r\n      y en extremo dichoso,\r\n      quien un suspiro te debió amoroso.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n    Lisi, yo te vì en sueños tan piadosa,\r\n      como despierta el alma le desea,\r\n      pero menos hermosa.\r\n      Quién habrá que tal crea?\r\n      dos imposibles me fingió la idéa,\r\n      y con ser su ilusion tan engañosa\r\n      la temo misteriosa,\r\n      y que inmortal en mì el tormento sea,\r\n      si no has de ser piadosa hasta ser fea.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n    Lisis, este diamante\r\n      de mi firmeza simbolo brillante\r\n      en que quiso incluir naturaleza\r\n      un rayo de la luz de tu belleza,\r\n      bien constante, y helado,\r\n      a nuestros corazones retratado,\r\n      mas puede la experiencia persuadirme,\r\n      que es el tuyo mas duro, el mio mas firme.\r\n\r\n[525] See vol. 2. of the _Obras_.\r\n\r\n[526] For example:--\r\n\r\n        Los Estados, de aquel vinculo libres,\r\n    eligieron concordes a Christiano,\r\n    hijo de Teodorico\r\n    de Oldemburg y Delmenhorste Conde\r\n    (progenio del famoso Witekindo,\r\n    sucesor de los Reyes de Saxonia,\r\n    con titulo de Duque)\r\n    casó con Dorotéa,\r\n    viuda de Christoval,\r\n    y coronóse luego en Copenhaguen.\r\n    En tanto los Suecos eligieron\r\n    a Carlos, y tuvieron\r\n    los dos dudosa guerra;\r\n    pero siendo vencido y desterrado,\r\n    y Christiano en Suecia coronado,\r\n    llevó a Dania el tesoro de aquel Reyno:\r\n    a que añadió la herencia\r\n    de Sleswic y de Holsacia,\r\n    por la muerte de Adolfo,\r\n    su director y tio.\r\n\r\n    _Selvas Danicas_ 1. cap. ii.\r\n\r\n[527] The commencement, for instance:--\r\n\r\n        La selva mas pomposa,\r\n    que a su deidad consagra Dinamarca,\r\n    tiene por centro un christalino lago,\r\n    que de un ameno isleo,\r\n    que visten flores y coronan plantas,\r\n    es fragrante y lucida competencia,\r\n    es hundosa tambien circumferencia:\r\n    y él a las bellas Ninfas,\r\n    de la deidad al culto dedicadas,\r\n    apacible teatro,\r\n    donde lazos y redes\r\n    suelen tender en las estivas calmas,\r\n    a los peces, las fieras y las almas.\r\n    Aqui yo fatigado\r\n    de un infinito número de penas,\r\n    de procelosas iras agitado,\r\n    del destino arrastrando las cadenas,\r\n    cierto de sus injurias,\r\n    y del progreso de mi vida incierto,\r\n    no esperado tomé traquilo puerto;\r\n    y entre sus verdes y floridas greñas\r\n    de la deidad reverencié las señas.\r\n\r\n[528] For example:--\r\n\r\n        Hasta el cordon vestido de ladrillo\r\n    de tierra solo el parapeto aprueba,\r\n    a quantos en su fábrica molestan\r\n    pagan con lo que duran lo que cuestan:\r\n    la linea de defensa\r\n    al tiro de mosquete no aventage,\r\n    ni excedan de noventa,\r\n    ni tengan menos de sesenta grados\r\n    los ángulos franqueados;\r\n    capaces los traveses,\r\n    y las golas no estrechas,\r\n    entre sí guarden proporciones tales,\r\n    que por perfecionar algunas cosas\r\n    no queden las demás defectuosas.\r\n\r\n    _Selva militar y polit. Distincion_,\r\n    (that is to say, _Section_,) vi. § 2.\r\n\r\n[529] For example:--\r\n\r\n            La antigüedad llamó advertidamiente\r\n        los consejeros ojos,\r\n        son del cuerpo politico y humano\r\n        adalides forzosos,\r\n        que han de haber visto mucho,\r\n        verlo de lejos y de cerca todo,\r\n        y recibir especies diferentes,\r\n        y por los nervios opticos\r\n        comunicarlas al comun sentido,\r\n        representando fieles los obgetos,\r\n        sin ocultar virtudes ni defetos;\r\n        el Reyno que no admite compañia\r\n        anda a ciegas sin ellos,\r\n        la prudencia Real está librada\r\n        en saber escogellos,\r\n        y a cuidadoso examen obligada.\r\n\r\n        1. c. _Distincion_ xxiii. § 2.\r\n\r\n[530] The Duke of Veragua’s letter, together with Calderon’s answer,\r\nand the catalogue to which the correspondence bears reference, are\r\nprinted in La Huerta’s _Teatro Hespañol_, vol. iii. part ii.\r\n\r\n[531] Satisfactory accounts of the various collections and editions of\r\nthe dramas, and other less important works of Calderon, are contained\r\nin Dieze’s Remarks on Velasquez, p. 242 and p. 341. The dramas of\r\nCalderon, which La Huerta has published in his _Teatro Hespañol_,\r\nafford but a partial idea of the poet’s talent; for those he has\r\nselected are all _Comedias de Capa y Espada_, two only excepted; and\r\nof these two, one, which is styled a _Comedia heroyca_, belongs to the\r\nmythological class.\r\n\r\n[532] See the definition of the various classes of the Spanish comedy,\r\np. 364, 5, 6, 7.\r\n\r\n[533] According to the testimony of travellers, even the most\r\nunlettered Spaniard is so accustomed to follow without effort a\r\ncomplicated dramatic plot, that after witnessing the representation of\r\na piece, he will describe all the minute details of the romantic story,\r\nwhile a well informed foreigner, familiar with the Spanish language,\r\ncan with difficulty comprehend a few of the scenes.\r\n\r\n[534] A very superficial criticism on Calderon’s dramatic works,\r\nwritten by Blas Nasarre, who was prepossessed in favour of French\r\nliterature, is contained in the History of Spanish Poetry, by\r\nVelasquez. See Dieze’s edition, p. 341.\r\n\r\n[535]\r\n\r\n    _Ines._     Qué ayrosa te has levantado?\r\n                Esta vez sola, señora,\r\n                no hiciera falta la aurora,\r\n                quando en su cristal nevado\r\n                dormida hubiera quedado;\r\n                pues tu luz correr pudiera\r\n                la cortina lisonjera\r\n                al sol, siendo sumillér\r\n                de uno y otro rosiclér,\r\n                deydad de una y otra esfera.\r\n                Bien _el concepto Hespañol\r\n                dixera_, viendote ahora....\r\n\r\n    _D.

Jorn._ i.\r\n\r\n[536] For example, in a tender conversation which occurs in the comedy,\r\nentitled, “A House with two Doors is ill to Watch.”\r\n\r\n    _Lisardo._  Dificilmente pudiera\r\n                conseguir, señora, el Sol,\r\n                que la flor de girasol\r\n                su resplandor seguiera.\r\n                Dificilmente quisiera\r\n                el Norte, fixa luz clara,\r\n                que el Imán no le mirára;\r\n                y el Imán deficilmente\r\n                intentára, que obediente\r\n                el acero le dexára.\r\n                Si Sol es vuestro explendor,\r\n                girasol la dicha mia:\r\n                si Norte vuestra porfia,\r\n                piedra Imán es mi dolor:\r\n                si es Imán vuestro rigor,\r\n                acero mi ardor severo;\r\n                pues cómo quedarme espero;\r\n                quando veo, que se ván,\r\n                mi Sol, mi Norte, y mi Imán,\r\n                siendo flor, piedra y acero?\r\n\r\n  _Casa con dos Puertas, mala\r\n  es de Guardar. Jorn._ i.\r\n\r\nThe lady replies to this compliment in a similar strain.\r\n\r\n[537] In the _Casa con dos Puertas, &c._ the valet thus jokes with the\r\nlady’s maid, who is on the stage with her mistress, but both veiled:--\r\n\r\n    _Calabazas._ Mui malditísimas caras\r\n                 debeis de tener las dos.\r\n\r\n    _Silvia._    Mucho mejores, que vos.\r\n\r\n    _Calabaz._   Y està bien encarecido;\r\n                 porque yo soy un _Cupido_.\r\n\r\n    _Silvia._    _Cupido_ somos yo y tú.\r\n\r\n    _Calabaz._   Cómo?\r\n\r\n    _Silvia._    Yo el _pido_, y tù el _cu_.\r\n\r\n    _Calabaz._   No me estâ bien el partido.\r\n\r\n[538] An incident of this occurs in the first scene of the piece,\r\nentitled, _Dar Tiempo al Tiempo_, (Give Time to Time).\r\n\r\n    _Voz._      Agua va!\r\n\r\n    _Chacon._            Mientas, picaña;\r\n                que esto no es agua.\r\n\r\n    _D.

Jorn._ i.\r\n\r\n[539] These stories are sometimes related in the most elegant octaves;\r\nfor example, in the play, entitled, _Con quien Vengo, Vengo_, (I Come\r\nwith whom I Come), there is one which commences in the following way:--\r\n\r\n        Yo vì en Milan una mujer tan bella.\r\n    No digo bien mujer. Yo vì una Diosa,\r\n    en los cielos de Abril fragante estrella,\r\n    en los campos del sol luciente rosa\r\n    tan entendida, tan sagaz, que en ella,\r\n    como demas estaba, el ser hermosa,\r\n    que parece formó naturaleza\r\n        Tal fue, que habiendo, á mi desvelo dado\r\n    mas de alguna ocasion, y habiendo sido\r\n    agradecido iman de mi cuidado\r\n    y no ingrata prision de mi sentido:\r\n    habiendo pues á mi temor librado\r\n    necios favores, que borró el olbido,\r\n    con nueva voluntad, con nuevo empeño,\r\n    mudable me dexó por otro dueño.\r\n\r\n  _Con quien Vengo, Vengo. Jorn._ ii.\r\n\r\n[540] For example, in the play, entitled, _Bien vengas Mal, si vengas\r\nSolo_, (Misfortune comes Well, if it comes Alone), a lady resolutely\r\nrefuses to betray a secret, which her lover endeavours to extort from\r\nher.\r\n\r\n    _D. Diego._ Mujer eres: poco importa,\r\n                que descubras un secreto.\r\n                No aspires, Doña Ana, à ser\r\n                el prodigio de estos tiempos.\r\n\r\n    _D.

Jorn._ i.\r\n\r\n[541] In _Los Empeños de un Acaso_, (the Consequences of an Accident),\r\na lover resolves, for his mistress’s sake, to assist his rival in a\r\ncase of difficulty:--\r\n\r\n    Qué noble, honrado y valiente,\r\n        viendo humilde á su enemigo,\r\n        no le ampara y favorece?\r\n        No solo pues la licencia\r\n        que me pide, le concede\r\n        mi valor; mas la palabra,\r\n        de ayudarle, y de valerle,\r\n        hasta que á su dama libre.\r\n        El caso, Don Diego, es este.\r\n        Mirad, como faltar puedo\r\n        á su amparo, quando tiene\r\n        privelegios de enemigo,\r\n        y de amigo en mì Don Felix?\r\n\r\n  _Los Empeños de un Acaso. Jorn._ iii.\r\n\r\n[542] Thus, a father points out the levity of another lady, as an\r\nexample for his daughter to avoid:--\r\n\r\n    Ya ves, hija, lo que pasa,\r\n        á quien dá necios oidos\r\n        á pensamientos perdidos.\r\n        Mira fuera de su casa\r\n        una mujer, que ha venido\r\n        buscandonos por sagrado.\r\n        Mira un amante empeñado,\r\n        mira un hermano ofendido,\r\n        y mirala à ella en efecto\r\n        á riesgo, por un error,\r\n        de perder vida y honor.\r\n\r\n  _Dar Tiempo al Tiempo. Jorn._ i.\r\n\r\n[543] The piece, entitled, _Tambien hay duelo en las Damas_, (Ladies\r\nalso have their Troubles), terminates in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n        Con cuyo raro suceso,\r\n    sacando la moraleja,\r\n    quede al mundo por exemplo,\r\n    que hubo una vez en el mundo\r\n    mujer, amor y secreto,\r\n    _porque hubo duelo en las damas_.\r\n    Perdonad sus muchos yerros.\r\n\r\n[544] For example, the double soliloquies, which run in concert, and of\r\nwhich the following is a specimen:--\r\n\r\n    _D. Diego._ Habrá hombre mas infeliz!\r\n\r\n    _D. Pedro._ Habrá hombre mas desdichado!\r\n\r\n    _D. Diego._ Qué no haya una ingrata hallado!\r\n\r\n    _D.

Jorn._ ii.\r\n\r\n[545] The Spanish title which Calderon has given to this comedy, is,\r\n_Darlo todo, y no dar Nada_, (To give all, and give Nothing).\r\n\r\n[546] Called by Calderon, _Las Armas de la Hermosura_, (The Arms of\r\nBeauty.)\r\n\r\n[547] The effect cannot be conceived without the necessary connection;\r\nbut the words spoken by the ghost of the prince, when about to head the\r\narmy, may be quoted here:--\r\n\r\n    _Alf._  Pues a embestir Enrique, que no hay duda\r\n            que el cielo nos ayuda.\r\n\r\n    _F._                            Si os ayuda\r\n\r\n_Sale Don Fernando._\r\n\r\n            porque obligando al cielo,\r\n            que vió tu Fe, tu Religion, tu zelo,\r\n            oy tu causa defiende,\r\n            librarme a mi esclavitud pretende,\r\n            porque por raro exemplo\r\n            por tantos Templos, Dios me ofrece un Templo,\r\n            antorcha desafida del Oriente,\r\n            tu exercito arrogante\r\n            alumbrando he de ir siempre delante;\r\n            para que oy en trofeos,\r\n            iguales, gran Alfonso, en tu deseos,\r\n            llegues a Fez, no a coronarte agora\r\n            sino a librar mi Ocaso en el Aurora.\r\n\r\n  _Jornada_ iii.\r\n\r\n[548] Comparisons of heaven with the earth, and of water with the\r\nearth, through the idea of a flower, were dwelt on with a particular\r\nfondness by other Spanish poets of Calderon’s age. The following is a\r\nconversation between the Moorish Princess Phœnix, (Fenix was formerly a\r\nname for women in Spain), and her female slaves in a garden on the sea\r\nshore:--\r\n\r\n    _Zar._  Pues puedente divertir\r\n            tu tristeza estos jardines,\r\n            qual la primavera hermosa\r\n            labra en estatuas de rosa\r\n            sobre temples de jazmines,\r\n            hazle al már, un barco sea\r\n            dorado carro del Sol.\r\n\r\n    _Ros._  Y quando tanto arrebol\r\n            errar por sus ondas vea,\r\n            con grande melancolia\r\n            el jardin al már dirà:\r\n            ya el Sol en su centro està,\r\n            muy breve ha sido este dia.\r\n\r\n    _Fen._  Pues no me puedo alegrar,\r\n            formando sombras y lexos\r\n            la emulacion que en reflexos\r\n            tienen la tierra, y el már,\r\n            quando con grandezas sumas\r\n            compiten entre esplandores\r\n            las espumas a las flores,\r\n            las flores a las espumas.\r\n\r\n[549] With all their faults these two sonnets are so beautiful and so\r\nperfectly in Calderon’s style, that they may properly be included in\r\nthe collection of examples quoted here.--Prince Fernando brings flowers\r\nto the Princess Phœnix. After all sorts of handsome things have been\r\nuttered, Fernando says:--\r\n\r\n    Estas que fueron pompa, y alegria,\r\n        despertando al Albor de la mañana,\r\n        a la tarde seràn lastima vana,\r\n        durmiendo en braços de la noche fria.\r\n    Este matiz, que al cielo desafia,\r\n        Iris listado de oro, nieve y grana,\r\n        serà escarmiento de la vida humana,\r\n        tanto se emprende en termino de un dia.\r\n    A florecer las rosas madrugaron,\r\n        y para envejecerse florecieron,\r\n        cuna, y sepulcro en un boton hallaron.\r\n    Tales los hombres sus fortunas vieron,\r\n        en un dia nacieron, y espiraron,\r\n        que passados los siglos horas fueron.\r\n\r\nTo this Phœnix replies in a strain somewhat over poetic even for a\r\nMoorish Princess:--\r\n\r\n    _Fen._ Essos rasgos de luz, essas centellas,\r\n                que cobran con amagos superiores\r\n                alimentos del Sol en resplandores,\r\n                aquello viven que se duelen dellas.\r\n            Flores nocturnas son, aunque tan bellas,\r\n                efimeras padecen sus ardores;\r\n                pues si un dia es el siglo de las flores,\r\n                una noche es la edad de las estrellas.\r\n            De essa pues Primavera fugitiva,\r\n                ya nuestro mal, ya nuestro bien se infiere,\r\n                registro es nuestro, ò muera el Sol, ò viva.\r\n            Que duracion avrá que el hombre espere,\r\n                ò que mudança avrá que no reciba\r\n                de Astro, que cada noche nace, y muere?\r\n\r\n[550]\r\n\r\n    _Fer._  Valiente Moro, y galan,\r\n            si adoras como refieres,\r\n            si idolatras como dizes,\r\n            si amas como encareces,\r\n            si zelas como suspiras,\r\n            si como rezelas temes,\r\n            y si como sientes amas,\r\n            dichosamente padeces,\r\n            no quiero por tu rescate\r\n            más precio, de que le acetes.\r\n            Buelvete, y dile a tu dama,\r\n            que por su esclavo te ofrece\r\n            un Portugues Cavallero,\r\n            i si obligada pretendo\r\n            pagarme el precio por ti;\r\n            yo de doy lo que me deves,\r\n            cobra la deuda en amor,\r\n            y logra tus interesses.\r\n\r\n[551] The list is given in the appendix to his _Theatro Hespañol_,\r\nunder the title:--_Catalogo Alphabetico de las Comedias Tragedias_, &c.\r\nMadrid, 1785.\r\n\r\n[552] The _Alcazar del Secreto_, and the _Gitanilla de Madrid_, and\r\nseveral other pieces of merit, by Antonio de Solis, may be found in La\r\nHuerta’s _Theatro Hespañol_. Accounts of the editions of the dramas and\r\nother works of this ingenious writer, are given by Dieze in his edition\r\nof Velasquez.\r\n\r\n[553] This piece is printed with several others by Moreto, in the\r\n_Theatro Hespañol_.\r\n\r\n[554] It belongs to the class of _comedias de figuron_. (See p. 367.)\r\nLa Huerta places this comedy at the commencement of his _Theatro\r\nHespañol_.\r\n\r\n[555] Blankenburg, in his literary appendix to Sulzer’s Dictionary,\r\nexpresses a doubt whether there ever was a particular collection of the\r\ncomedies of Maestro Tirso de Molina. I can at least state that I have\r\nseen a fifth volume of his comedies, (Madrid, 1636, in quarto), which\r\ncontains eleven dramas, chiefly historical and spiritual.\r\n\r\n[556] This is the only drama by Rojas given in La Huerta’s Theatre; and\r\nin the older collections the works of Rojas seldom appear.\r\n\r\n[557] Many of his dramas may be found in various collections. They are\r\nincluded along with his other poems in the _Cithara de Apolo by D.\r\nAgust. de Salazar y Torres, Madrid_, 1692, in two volumes, published by\r\none of the author’s friends, who on his part was a perfect Gongorist,\r\nas the title of the collection sufficiently proves.\r\n\r\n[558] Nicolas Antonio, a very incompetent judge in matters of taste,\r\nlauds Antonio de Mescua to the skies. But he is seldom mentioned by\r\nother authors.\r\n\r\n[559] A historical comedy by Guillen de Castro, entitled, _Las\r\nMocedades del Cid_, furnished Corneille with the idea of his tragedy of\r\nthe Cid.\r\n\r\n[560] An elegant edition of the _Historia de la Conquista de Mexico,\r\npor D. Antonio de Solis_, in 2 vols. quarto, was published at Madrid in\r\n1776.\r\n\r\n[561] The following are the historiographic rules of Antonio de Solis,\r\nin his own words:--\r\n\r\n_Los Adornos de la Eloquencia son accidentes en la Historia_, cuya\r\nsubstancia _es la Verdad_, que _dicha como fue, se dize bien_: siendo\r\nla puntualidad de la noticia la mejor elegancia de la Narracion. Con\r\neste conocimiento he puesto en la certidumbre de lo que refiero, mi\r\nprincipal cuydado. Examen, que algunas vezes me bolviò à la tarea\r\nde los Libros, y Papeles: porque hallando en los Sucessos, ò en sus\r\ncircunstancias, discordantes, con notable oposicion, à nuestros mismos\r\nEscritores, me ha sido necessario buscar la Verdad con poca luz, ò\r\ncongeturarla de lo mas verisimil; pero digo entonces mi reparo: y si\r\nllego á formar opinion, conozco la flaqueza de mi dictamen, y dexo, lo\r\nque afirmo, al arbitrio de la razon.--_Prologo._\r\n\r\n[562] They are all collected under the title of _Obras de Lorenzo\r\nGracian, &c. Amberes_, 1725, in 2 vols. quarto.\r\n\r\n[563] Of this the following fragment of a conversation between Fortune\r\nand a dissatisfied person, affords a specimen:--\r\n\r\nTampoco será el llamarte hijo de tu madre. Menos, antes me glorio yo\r\nde esso, que ni yo sin ella, ni ella sin mi: ni Venus sin Cupido, ni\r\nCupido sin Venus. Ya se lo que es, dixo la Fortuna. Que? Que sientes\r\nmucho el hazerte heredero de tu abuelo el mar, en la inconstancia,\r\ny engaños? No por cierto, que essas son niñerias; pues si estas son\r\nburlas, que seràn las veras? Lo que à mi me irrita, es, que me levanten\r\ntestimonies. Aguarda, que ya te entiendo, sin duda es aquello que\r\ndizen, que trocaste el arco con la muerte, y que desde entonces no te\r\nllaman ya amor de amar, sino de morir, amor á muerte; de modo, que\r\namor, y muerte todo es uno. _Crisi_ iv.\r\n\r\n[564] He reduces all mental talents and faculties to two kinds, _Genio_\r\nand _Ingenio_. But the distinctions he draws between them, are as\r\ndifficult to translate as the different applications of the French word\r\n_Esprit_. On this subject he says, among other things:--\r\n\r\nEstos dos son _los dos Exes del lucimiento discreto_, la naturaleza los\r\nalterna, y el arte los realça. Es el hombre aquel celebre Microcosmos,\r\ny el Alma su firmamento. Hermanados el Genio, y el Ingenio, en\r\nverificacion de Athlante, y de Alcides; asseguran el brillar, por lo\r\ndichoso, y lo lucido, á todo el resto de prendas.\r\n\r\nEl uno sin el otro, fue en muchos felicidad à medias, acusando la\r\nembidia, ò el descuido de la suerte.\r\n\r\n  _El discreto, Opp._ T. i. p. 389.\r\n\r\n[565] For example, in the treatise last quoted, he says:--\r\n\r\nAy hombres tan desiguales en las materias, tan diferentes de si mismos\r\nen las ocasiones, que desmienten su propio credito, y deslumbran\r\nnuestro concepto; en unos puntos discurren, que buelan, en otros, ni\r\nperciben, ni se mueven. Oy todo les sale bien, mañana todo mal, que aun\r\nel entendimiento, y la ventura tienen desiguales. Donde no ay disculpa,\r\nes en la voluntad, que es crimen del alvedrio, y su variar no està\r\nlexos del desvariar. Lo que oy ponen sobre su cabeça, mañana lo llevan\r\nentre pies, por no tener pies, ni cabeça.\r\n\r\n[566] The Spanish title of this work is, _Agudeza y Arte de Ingenio_.\r\n\r\n[567] Si el percibir la agudeza acredita de Aguila, el produzirla\r\nempeñara en Angel: empleo de Cherubines y elevacion de hombres, que nos\r\nremonta à extravagante Gerarquia.\r\n\r\n[568] Es este ser uno de aquellos, que son mas conocidos à bulto y\r\nmenos à precision: dexase percibir, no definir, y en tan remoto assunto\r\nestimese qualquiera descripcion, lo que es para los ojos la hermosura,\r\ny para los oidos la consonancia, esso es para el entendimiento el\r\nconcepto.\r\n\r\n  _Agudeza y Arte de Ingenio. Discurso_ ii.\r\n\r\n[569] These letters are contained in the collection of Mayans y Siscar.\r\n\r\n[570] The _Real Academia Española_, founded on the plan of the\r\n_Académie Française_.\r\n\r\n[571] It is singular that over all Europe, the Portuguese phrase, _Auto\r\nda Fe_, has become current in preference to the Spanish _Auto de Fe_.\r\n\r\n[572] La Huerta includes this play among the four _Comedias Heroycas_\r\nof his _Theatro Hespañol_, probably for the sake of its elegant\r\nlanguage; for in other respects it would not have been difficult to\r\nhave selected a better drama in the class to which it belongs.\r\n\r\n[573] This comedy, which may be found in many collections, is also\r\nincluded in La Huerta’s _Theatro Hespañol_.\r\n\r\n[574] This piece is also contained in the _Theatro Hespañol_.\r\n\r\n[575] For example, the word _Madamisela_ from the French\r\n_Mademoiselle_. In like manner Cervantes introduced the word _Madama_,\r\nbut it is employed only in a comic sense.\r\n\r\n[576] I have seen the third edition of the poetic writings of this\r\nlady. The following is the title:--_Poemas de la unica poetisa\r\nAmericana, Musa decima, Soror Juana Inez de la Cruz, &c. Sacolas a luz\r\nD. Juan Camacho Gayna, Cavallero del orden de Santiago, &c. Barcelona_\r\n1691, in quarto.--It certainly would not be fair to pass by unnoticed\r\na book of this kind which went through three editions.\r\n\r\n[577] The following is one of three sonnets, in which the authoress\r\nrings changes on the theme, “whether it is better to be beloved without\r\nloving, or to love without being beloved.”\r\n\r\n    Feliciano me adora, y le aborrezco;\r\n        Lisardo me aborrece, y le adoro;\r\n        por quien no me apetece ingrato, lloro;\r\n        y al que me llora tierno, no apetezco:\r\n    A quien mas me desdora, el alma ofrezco,\r\n        à quien me ofrece victimas, desdoro;\r\n        desprecio al que enrriqueze mi decoro;\r\n        y al que le haze desprecios, enrriquezco:\r\n    Si con mi ofensa al uno reconvengo,\r\n        me reconviene el otro à mi ofendido\r\n        y à padecer de todos modos vengo;\r\n    Pues ambos atormentan mi sentido;\r\n        aqueste con pedir lo que no tengo,\r\n        y aqueste con no tener lo que le pido.\r\n\r\n[578] For example, the following, in which, however, the play of the\r\nAntitheses becomes at last frigid.\r\n\r\n    En persiguirme, Mundo, que interessas?\r\n        en que te ofendo? quando solo intento\r\n        poner bellezas en mi entendimiento,\r\n        y no mi entendimiento en las bellezas?\r\n    Yo no estimo thesoros, ni riquezas;\r\n        y assi, siempre me causa mas contento,\r\n        poner riquezas en mi entendimiento;\r\n        que no mi entendimiento en las riquezas.\r\n    Y no estimo hermosura, que vencida,\r\n        es despojo civil de las Edades;\r\n        ni riqueza me agrada fementida:\r\n    Teniendo por mejor en mis Verdades,\r\n        consumir vanidades de la Vida,\r\n        que consumir la Vida en vanidades.\r\n\r\n[579] One of these lyric romances begins in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n    Finjamos, que soy feliz,\r\n        triste pensamiento, un rato;\r\n        quizà podreis persuadirme,\r\n        aunque yo sè lo contrario.\r\n    Que, pues solo en la aprehension\r\n        dizen, que estrivan los daños;\r\n        si os imaginais dichoso,\r\n        no sereis tan desdichado.\r\n    Sirvame el entendimiento\r\n        alguna vez de descanso;\r\n        y no siempre estè el ingenio\r\n        con el provecho encontrado.\r\n    Todo el mundo es opiniones,\r\n        de pareceres tan varios;\r\n        que lo que el uno, que es negro,\r\n        el otro prueba, que es blanco.\r\n\r\n[580] It commences thus:--\r\n\r\n    _Nar._ De buscar à Narciso fatigada,\r\n    sin permitir sossiego à mi pie errante,\r\n    ni à mi planta cansada,\r\n    que tantos ha yá dias, que vagante\r\n    examina las breñas\r\n    sin poder encontrar mas que las señas:\r\n        A este Bosque he llegado, donde espero\r\n    tener noticias de mi Bien perdido,\r\n    que si señas confiero,\r\n    diziendo està del Prado lo florido,\r\n    que producir amenidàdes tantas,\r\n    es por aver besado yà sus Plantas.\r\n        O quantos dias ha, que he examinado\r\n    la Selva flor à flor, y planta à planta\r\n    gastando congoxado\r\n    mi triste coraçon en pena tanta,\r\n    y mi pie fatigando vagamundo\r\n    tiempo, que siglos son, selva, que es Mundo.\r\n\r\n[581] The new edition which I have now before me, entitled, _Obras\r\npoeticas del Excellmo. Señor Don Eugenio Gerardo Lobo, Madrid_, 1758,\r\nin 2 vols. quarto, is printed in a style of elegance by no means common\r\nin Spanish books of that period.\r\n\r\n[582] The title is:--_La Poetica, ò Reglas de la poesia en general,\r\ny de sus principales especies, por D. Ignacio de Luzan Claramunt de\r\nSuelves, y Gurrea_, Zaragoza, 1737.\r\n\r\n[583] He says:--Yo sè, que estas cosas, donde la critica tiene alguna\r\nparte, se suelen bautizar de algunos con el nombre de _bachillerias_.\r\n\r\n[584] See page 323.\r\n\r\n[585] Thus, he says, Homer intended his Iliad, as a book of moral and\r\npolitical instruction, suited to the most vulgar understanding:--\r\n\r\nCon este intento escribiò _Homero_ sus Poemas, explicando en ellos\r\n_à los entendimientos mas bassos_ las verdades de _la Moral_, de _la\r\nPolitica_, y tambien (como muchos sientan) de la Philosophia natural,\r\ny de la Theologia. Pues en la Iliada debaxo de la Imagen de la Guerra\r\nTroyana, y de las disensiones de los Capitanes Griegos, propuso à la\r\nGrecia entonces dividida en vandos _un exemplo en que aprendiesse_ à\r\napaciguar sus discordias, conociendo quan graves daños causaban al\r\npublico, y quan necessaria para el sucesso en las empressas era la\r\nunion, y concordia de los Gefes de un Exercito.--Book I.\r\n\r\n[586] The following passage will afford a specimen of Luzan’s didactic\r\nstyle:--\r\n\r\nY estos con el vano, inutil _aparato de agudezas, y conceptos\r\nafectados, de metaphoras extravagantes, de expressiones hinchadas, y de\r\nterminos cultos, y nuevos_, embelesaron el Vulgo, y aplaudidos de la\r\nignorancia comun, se usurparon la gloria debida à los buenos Poetas.\r\nFuè creciendo este desorden sin que nadie intentasse oponersele. Los\r\nignorantes, no teniendo quien les abriesse los ojos, seguian aciegas la\r\nvoceria de los aplausos populares, y alababan lo que no entendian, sin\r\nmas razon que la de el exemplo ajeno.--Book I.\r\n\r\n[587] He says:--Digo, que se podrà _definir_ la Poesia, imitacion de\r\nla naturaleza o en lo universal, o en lo particular, hecha en versos,\r\no para utilidad, o para deleite de los hombres, o para uno y otro\r\njuntamente.--Lib. I. cap. 5.\r\n\r\n[588] The following are his own words:--\r\n\r\nEstos dos diversos assuntos, y fines hacen tambien diversa la Fabula\r\nTragica de la Comica, y à entrambas de la Fabula en general: à\r\ntodas tres es comun el ser un _discurso inventado_, ò una _ficcion\r\nde un hecho_: pero con esta diferencia, que la Fabula Tragica ha\r\nde ser _imitacion de un hecho en modo apto para corregir el temor,\r\ny la compassion, y otras passiones_: y la Fabula Comica ha de ser\r\n_imitacion, ò ficcion de un hecho en modo apto para inspirar el amor\r\nde alguna virtud, ò el desprecio, y aborrecimiento de algun vicio, ú\r\ndefecto._--_Lib. III._\r\n\r\n[589] He says:--\r\n\r\nY en fè de que en mi no falta tan debida equidad no pudiendo referir\r\naqui distintamente, y por menudo los muchos aciertos de nuestros\r\nComicos, porque para esso seria menester escribir un gran volumen à\r\nparte; me contentarè con decir por mayor, y en general, que en todos\r\ncomunmente hallo rara ingeniosidad, singular agudeza, y discrecion,\r\nprendas mui essenciales para formar grandes poetas, y dignas de\r\nadmiracion; y añado que en particular alabarè siempre en _Lope de Vega_\r\nla natural facilidad de su estylo, y la suma destreza, con que en\r\nmuchas de sus Comedias se ven pintadas las costumbres, y el _character_\r\nde algunas personas: en _Calderòn_ admiro la nobleza de su locucion,\r\nque sin ser jamàs obscura, ni afectada, es siempre elegante; &c.--Lib.\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n[590] Velasquèz, under the conviction that nothing could be more\r\ncorrect and striking than Luzan’s judgment on the Spanish drama, has\r\nquoted his opinions at length, and incorporated them in his History of\r\nSpanish Poetry.\r\n\r\n[591] The two opening stanzas of this poem, will afford a sufficient\r\nspecimen of the poetic diction of the ingenious author:--\r\n\r\n        Ahora es tiempo, Euterpe, que templemos\r\n    el arco y cuerdas, y de nuestro canto\r\n    se oyga la voz por todo el emisferio.\r\n    Las vencedoras sienes coronemos\r\n    del sagrado laurel al que es espanto\r\n    del infiel Mauritano al Marte Ibero.\r\n    Ya para quàndo quiero\r\n    los himnos de alegria y las canciones,\r\n    premio no vil que el coro de las nueve\r\n    à las fatigas debe,\r\n    y al valor de esforzados corazones?\r\n    Para quando estará, Musas, guardado\r\n    aquel furor que bebe\r\n    con las hondas suavisimas mezclando\r\n    de la Castalia fuente al labio solo\r\n    de quien tuvo al nacer propicio Apolo?\r\n        Una selva de pinos y de abetes\r\n    cubriò la mar, angusta à tanta quilla:\r\n    para henchir tanta vela faltó el viento.\r\n    De flamulas el ayre y gallardetes\r\n    poblado divisò desde la orilla\r\n    pálido el Africano y sin aliento:\r\n    del húmedo elemento\r\n    dividiendo los liquidos cristales,\r\n    y blandiendo Neptuno el gran Tridente,\r\n    alzò ayrado la frente,\r\n    de ovas coronado y de corales.\r\n    Quién me agovia con tanta pesadumbre\r\n    la espalda? Hay quién intente\r\n    poner tal vez en nueva servidumbre\r\n    mi libre imperio? o por ventura alguno\r\n    me la quiere usurpar? No soy Neptuno?\r\n\r\n[592] The following three stanzas from this poem will serve to shew\r\nthe manner in which Luzan combined his poetic subject with the\r\npeculiarities requisite in a poem written on a particular occasion:--\r\n\r\n        Qual fabulosa antiguedad pintaba\r\n    al padre libre, ò al Dardano Xanto,\r\n    quando sobre las ondas se asomaba\r\n    à oir de algun mortal queja ò quebranto;\r\n    ò como al dios Neptuno figuraba\r\n    Musa gentil en su fingido canto,\r\n    quando iba por el mar con Deyopéa,\r\n    Cimodoce, Nerine, y Galatéa.\r\n        Tal Manzanares à mi vista ofrece\r\n    espectáculo nuevo y agradable:\r\n    crece mi suspension, mi pasmo crece\r\n    al ver que aquel anciano venerable\r\n    conmigo desde el agua à hablar empieze\r\n    con apacible voz y rostro afable:\r\n    fielmente su discurso no prolijo\r\n    conserva la memoria; asi me dijo:\r\n        Estrangero pastor, que en mi ribera\r\n    buscas tranquilidad à tus fatigas,\r\n    vète otra vez, no es este la primera,\r\n    y sè tu nombre yà, sin que lo digas:\r\n    las bellas Ninfas de esta undosa esfera\r\n    únicas son de tu zampoña amigas:\r\n    zampoña y voz antes de ahora oyeron;\r\n    antes tambien à entrambas aplaudieron.\r\n\r\n[593] These, and the other _inedita_ of Luzan, are included in the\r\nsecond and fourth volumes of the _Parnaso Español_.\r\n\r\n[594] _Oracion en que se exhorta à seguir la verdadera idea de la\r\neloquencia Española._ It is contained in the first volume of the ten\r\nquoted _Origenes_ of this meritorious author.\r\n\r\n[595] _Rhetorica de Don Gregorio Mayans y Siscar._ Valencia, 1757, 2\r\nvolumes, 8vo.\r\n\r\n[596] See page 351.\r\n\r\n[597] See Dieze on Velasquez p. 265. Lessing has made the Germans\r\nacquainted with Montiano’s Virginia. Though Lessing knew little of\r\nSpanish dramatic literature, even at second hand, he at that time\r\ntook an interest in every tragic Virginia, because he was engaged in\r\na Virginia of his own, which he ultimately converted into his Emilia\r\nGalotti.\r\n\r\n[598] In the fifth act, when the catastrophe is near its developement,\r\nVirginia discourses in the following manner with Icilius, her betrothed\r\nbridegroom:--\r\n\r\n    _Virg._ Casi, Señor, mi gratitud quisiera\r\n    no haberte yà elegido por mi dueño;\r\n    porque fina lo hiciesse el alma ahora.\r\n    Tode el honor, la libertad me vale,\r\n    que aùn es mas beneficio que la vida.\r\n    Por tu esfuerzo lo gozo, y voluntaria\r\n    de tu dominio la declaro sierva:\r\n    serà la possession con que te brindo\r\n    legitima, Señor, si la acetares.\r\n\r\n    _Icìl._ Què corazon, Señora, habra tan duro,\r\n    que à ser feliz con tigo se resista?\r\n    Assi hubiesse logrado mi fortuna,\r\n    con la ruina total de tu enemigo,\r\n    librarte de una vez del triste ahogo.\r\n    Pero ni puede unir à mis parciales,\r\n    sino es à los que vès que me acompañan.\r\n    Ni de Valerio sè, ni sé de Horacio,\r\n    tal vez por ignorar nuestro conflicto,\r\n    ò por la angustia, y brevedad del tiempo.\r\n\r\n[599] _Discurso sobre las tragedias Españolas, de D. Agustin de\r\nMontiano y Luyando, &c._ Madrid 1750, in 8vo. published along with\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n[600] The following are his own words:--\r\n\r\nPor mi ofrezco al publico _La Virginia_; Tragedia que he procurado\r\ntrabajar con algun estudio, y desuelo: y si logro que no se desprecie,\r\nserà quanta ventaja puedo proponerme, y esperar por _galardon de mi\r\nfatiga_: mas el _inducir à mis compatriotas, à que imiten este rumbo_,\r\ny à que le mejoren (como le serà mas facil que à mi à qualquiera\r\n_regular ingenio_) cabe unicamente en las facultades de la providencia,\r\nsegun la obstinacion de los muchos que permanecen alistados en las\r\n_centurias del ignorante vulgo_.\r\n\r\n[601] _El ignorante vulgo_, is the favourite expression of all the\r\nSpanish Gallicists, whenever they speak of the Spanish public.\r\n\r\n[602] The beautiful commencement of this _Egloga piscatoria_ may be\r\ntranscribed here:--\r\n\r\n        Bramaba el ronco viento,\r\n    y de nubes el sol obscurecido\r\n    horror al mar indómito añadia:\r\n    el liquido elemento\r\n    de rayos y relampagos herido\r\n    contra su proprio natural ardia.\r\n    Huye la luz del dia\r\n    que el fuego interrumpido sostituye.\r\n    De sus cabañas huye\r\n    el Pescador al monte mas vecino;\r\n    y solo en tan violento torbellino\r\n    rotas quedan del mar en las orillas\r\n    jarcias, entenas, arboles y quillas.\r\n        Objeto son funesto\r\n    y embarazo tambien de las arenas\r\n    naufragos leños y humedo velamen;\r\n    y en elemento opuesto\r\n    truecan los hombres aguas de horror llenas,\r\n    y las Focas la seca arena lamen.\r\n    Con pavoroso examen\r\n    advierte, destrozado su barquilla\r\n    en la trágica orilla\r\n    ALCION; y en el monte, aun mal seguro\r\n    recela GLAUCO; porque el golfo duro\r\n    abandonar su antiguo seno quiere,\r\n    y huir del Cielo, que le azota y hiere.\r\n\r\n[603] The commencement of this romance calls to mind the compositions\r\nof the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries:--\r\n\r\n        El Africano alarido\r\n    y el ronco son de las armas\r\n    en los valles de Gumiel\r\n    era saludos del Alba:\r\n        Que a ser testigo salia\r\n    de las victorias, que alcanzan\r\n    contra los infieles lunas\r\n    las cuchillas Castellanas:\r\n        Quando el valeroso Hizán\r\n    sobre una fogosa alfana,\r\n    regalo de Hacén, Alcaide\r\n    de Font-Hacén y la Adrada:\r\n        Desnudo el nervioso brazo,\r\n    y el albornóz a la espalda,\r\n    esgrime lo muerte en una\r\n    Tunecina cimitarra.\r\n        Crece la sangrienta lid,\r\n    y el suelo de sangre empapan\r\n    las azagayas Moriscas\r\n    y las Españolas lanzas.\r\n\r\n[604] These and the other poems extant by La Huerta, are included in\r\nthe _Obras poeticas de D. Vicente Garcia de la Huerta_, &c. Madrid,\r\n1779, in 2 volumes octavo.\r\n\r\n[605] See the preface to the before-mentioned _Obras_.\r\n\r\n[606] For example, in the following speech of Rachel. The king has left\r\nher; and she meditates on the probable consequences of his absence:--\r\n\r\n        El cielo os guarde.\r\n    Quanto, ay de mi, que os ausenteis, me pesa!\r\n    Qué es esto, congojado pecho mio?\r\n    Corazon, que temor te desalienta?\r\n    Qué sustos te atribulan? Ya Castilla,\r\n    a mi arbitrio no rinde la obediencia?\r\n    Pues, corazon, qué graves sobresaltos\r\n    son los que te combaten, y te aquejan?\r\n    Sin duda debe ser, que como el cielo\r\n    no te crió para tan alta esfera,\r\n    como es el Solio regio, mal se halla\r\n    tu natural humilde en su grandeza.\r\n    Tomen exemplo en mí los ambiciosos,\r\n    y en mis temores el sobervio advierta,\r\n    que quien se eleva sobre su fortuna,\r\n    por su desdicha, y por su mal se eleva.\r\n    Mas cómo asi me agravio neciamente?\r\n    Mi valor, mi hermosura, las estrellas,\r\n    el cielo mismo, que dotò mi alma\r\n    de tan noble ambicion, y la fomenta,\r\n    no confirman mi merito? &c.\r\n\r\n[607] He utters the following exclamations, while, at the same time, he\r\nendeavours to escape from the perils by which he is surrounded:--\r\n\r\n        O horror! o muerte! o tierra!\r\n    cómo a este desdichado no sepultas?\r\n    Tus profundas entrañas manifiesta,\r\n    y esconde en ellas mi cansada vida:\r\n    librame de los riesgos, que me cercan.\r\n    Qué susto! que pesar! Nadie se duele\r\n    de mi?\r\n\r\n[608] In one of the first scenes, Garcia de Castro avows his sentiments\r\nto the king with the spirit of a true knight and the fidelity of a\r\nsubject:--\r\n\r\n        Esa voz, que de escandalo y desorden\r\n    el viento puebla, o noble Alfonso Octavo,\r\n    Monarca de Castilla, quien por siglos\r\n    cuente el tiempo feliz de tu Reynado:\r\n    esa voz, que en el Templo originada\r\n    profanó del lugar los fueros santos,\r\n    y de la Magestad los privilegios\r\n    tan injuriosamente ha vulnerado;\r\n    si el fin, si los intentos se examinan,\r\n    y el zelo que la anima contemplamos,\r\n    aliento es del amor mas encendido,\r\n    voz del afecto mas acrisolado.\r\n    Voz es de tus Vasallos, que de serlo\r\n    testimonio jamás dieron mas claro,\r\n    que quando mas traydores te parecen,\r\n    que quanto los estás mas infamando, &c.\r\n\r\n[609] See page 308.\r\n\r\n[610] The narrative passages in octaves are excellent. For example:--\r\n\r\n        Los jovenes de Crisa valerosos,\r\n    con la paz de la Grecia mal contentos,\r\n    pues Troya ya rendida, a sus fogosos\r\n    espiritus faltaban los fomentos,\r\n    para ejercer sus brios generosos,\r\n    y noble alarde hacer de sus alientos,\r\n    disponen una fiesta, en que se encierra\r\n    retrato vivo de mentida guerra.\r\n        Previenense caballos y libreas,\r\n    ajustanse divisas y colores:\r\n    a aquel adornan joyas y preseas,\r\n    este copia al escudo sus amores,\r\n    Quanto oro dan las minas Européas,\r\n    y quantos brotan en Oriente olores,\r\n    eran a la lucida compañia\r\n    adorno, gusto, brillo y bizarria, &c.\r\n\r\n[611] This collection which has been so frequently alluded to in the\r\ncourse of the present work, is entitled:--_Theatro Hespañol, por Don\r\nVicente Garcia de la Huerta_, Madrid, 1785, sq. in 16 volumes, small\r\noctavo. The 16th volume, which contains some critical notices in the\r\nform of an appendix, was published very lately. The 15th volume, which\r\nbears the title of _Suplemento_, comprises the tragic dramas of La\r\nHuerta himself; and the 14th volume presents a choice selection of\r\nburlesque interludes. The work also contains an alphabetic list of most\r\nof the dramas in the Spanish language, which is extremely useful. The\r\ntitle is characteristic from the substitution of the word _Hespañol_\r\nfor _Español_, according to its derivation from _Hispanus_.\r\n\r\n[612] These expressions are collected from the prefaces to some of the\r\nvolumes of La Huerta’s _Theatro Hespañol_. It is not necessary to give\r\nprecise references to passages.\r\n\r\n[613] They are included in the first volume of the _Coleccion de Obras\r\nen verso y prosa de D. Tomàs de Yriarte_, Madrid, 1787, 8vo.\r\n\r\n[614] Fables cannot be judged of from fragments; therefore the\r\nsubjoined, which is in the popular song form, is transcribed at length.\r\n\r\n        Este fabulilla,\r\n    Salga bien, ò mal,\r\n    Me ha occurrido ahora\r\n    Por casualidad\r\n        Cerca de unos prados\r\n    Que hai en mi Lugar\r\n    Pasaba un Borrico\r\n    Por casualidad.\r\n        Una flauta en ellos\r\n    Halló, que un Zagal,\r\n    Se dexó olvidada\r\n    For casualidad.\r\n        Acercósé á olerla\r\n    El dicho animal;\r\n    Y dió un resoplido\r\n    Por casualidad.\r\n        En la flauta el aire\r\n    Se hubo de colar;\r\n    Y sonó la flauta\r\n    Por casualidad.\r\n        Oh! dixo el Borrico:\r\n    Qué bien sé tocar!\r\n    Y dirán que es mala\r\n    La música asnal.\r\n        Sin reglas del arte\r\n    Borriquitos hai\r\n    Que una vez aciertan\r\n    Por casualidad.\r\n\r\n[615] This fable may likewise be inserted here. It is particularly\r\nremarkable for the happy employment of the redondillas.\r\n\r\n        Un oso con que la vida\r\n    Ganaba un Piamontes\r\n    La no mui bien aprendida\r\n    Danza ensayaba en dos pies.\r\n        Queriendo hacer de persona,\r\n    Dixo á una Mona: Que tal?\r\n    Era perita la Mona,\r\n    Y respondióle: Mui mal.\r\n        Yo creo, replicó el Oso,\r\n    Que me haces poco favor.\r\n    Pues qué? mi aire no es garboso?\r\n    No hago el paso con primor?\r\n        Estaba el Cerdo presente,\r\n    Y dixo: Bravo! bien va!\r\n    Bailarin mas excelente\r\n    No se ha visto, ni verá.\r\n        Echó el Oso, al oir esto,\r\n    Sus cuentas allá entre si,\r\n    Y con ademan modesto\r\n    Hubo de exclamar así:\r\n        Quando me desaprobaba\r\n    La Mona, llegué á dudar:\r\n    Mas ya que el Cerdo me alaba,\r\n    Mui mal debo de bailar.\r\n        Guarde para su regalo\r\n    Esta sentencia un Autor:\r\n    Si el sabio no aprueba, malo!\r\n    Si el necio aplaude, peor!\r\n\r\n[616] La musica, poema. It has been several times printed. In the\r\n_Obras de D. Tomas Yriarte_ it occupies one half of the first volume.\r\n\r\n[617] For example, the following lines, which occur at the commencement\r\nof the second canto of the poem, and which relates to the invention and\r\nprogress of Music.\r\n\r\n        En la mas deliciosa\r\n    Y mas poblada aldéa\r\n    De la feliz Arcadia residia\r\n    La Zagala Criséa,\r\n    Que asi como de hermosa\r\n    Se llevaba entre mil la primacía,\r\n    Tambien por desdeñosa\r\n    Ganó justa opinion y nombradía.\r\n    Con tal delicadeza\r\n    De vido la criò Naturaleza,\r\n    Y alma la diò tan docil, é inclinada\r\n    A sentir de la Música el encanto,\r\n    Que en toda aquella rústica morada\r\n    Sólo algunos Pastores\r\n    Diestros en el tañido y en el canto\r\n    Osaban aspirar à sus favores, &c.\r\n\r\n[618] The following passage, which is mere prose, immediately succeeds\r\nthe invocation to Nature at the commencement of the poem.\r\n\r\n        Las varias sensaciones corporales,\r\n    Del corazon humano los afectos,\r\n    Y aun las mismas nociones ideales,\r\n    En diversos dialectos\r\n    Se expresan por los órganos vocales,\r\n    Pero si, estando el ánimo tranquilo,\r\n    Inspira simples y uniformes sones;\r\n    Quando se halla agitado de pasiones,\r\n    Nueva inflexion de acentos da al estilo:\r\n    El tono de la voz, alza y sostiene;\r\n    Tan pronto le retarda, ó le acelera;\r\n    Tan pronto le suaviza, ò le exâspera;\r\n    Con enérgicas pausas le detiene;\r\n    Le da compas y afinacion sonora,\r\n    Y à su arbitrio le aumenta, ó le minora.\r\n\r\n[619] The _Bibliotheca Española de los mejores escritores del reynado\r\nde Carlos III; por D. Juan Sempère y Guarinos, &c._ Madrid 1789, in\r\n6 volumes, 8vo. may be consulted with advantage. Useful particulars\r\nrespecting the latest Spanish productions in polite literature may also\r\nbe found in the publications of some recent travellers.\r\n\r\n[620] _Las Odas de D. Leon de Arroyal._ Madrid 1784, in 8vo.\r\n\r\n[621] For example, the commencement of the ode to Field Marshal\r\nNavahermosa.\r\n\r\n        Precioso es el diamante,\r\n    y esmeralda de Oriente,\r\n    y el oro mas que todo apetecido,\r\n    y cada qual bastante\r\n    á saciar de la gente\r\n    vulgar el vil espiritu abatido,\r\n    que nunca ha conocido\r\n    el precio que se encierra\r\n    en los claros honores de la guerra.\r\n        Una verde corona\r\n    de laurel, ú de oliva,\r\n    á un espiritu humilde es despreciable;\r\n    pero no al que á Belona\r\n    sigue, para que viva\r\n    su nombre entre los hombres admirable.\r\n    Nada hay tan codiciable\r\n    como la heroyca fama\r\n    al que de sí lo mas precioso ama.\r\n\r\n[622] Particularly in the verse which the Spaniards call _Rimas\r\nProvenzales_, viz:--\r\n\r\n        Ay, verde bosque! ay, soledad amada!\r\n    ay del manso arroyuelo amena orilla,\r\n    do la simple avecilla\r\n    con trinos al Pastor humilde agrada!\r\n    do la blanca y pintada mariposa\r\n    besa la rosa,\r\n    y el gilguerillo\r\n    en el palillo\r\n    de la alta encina\r\n    amante trina,\r\n    miéntras favonio y céfiro soplando,\r\n    el prado van de flores esmaltando.\r\n\r\n[623] The following song will afford a specimen of the poetic talent of\r\nthis unknown authoress:--\r\n\r\n        Por Endimion la Luna\r\n    desde los cielos baxa,\r\n    dexando el blanco carro\r\n    por una cueba parda.\r\n        Por Adonis Citeres\r\n    à pie corre y descalza,\r\n    colorando las rosas\r\n    con sangre de sus plantas.\r\n        Pues si hasta las Deidades\r\n    sienten de amor la llama,\r\n    y por amar descienden\r\n    de divinas á humanas:\r\n        Que harè yo estando herida\r\n    de la amorosa llaga,\r\n    si no darle à mi dueño\r\n    corazon, vida y alma?\r\n\r\n[624] I have seen only the first volume of the _Poesias de D. Juan\r\nMelendez Valdès_, Madrid, 1785, in 8vo. The contents of the second\r\nvolume are specified in a preliminary notice to the _Bibliotheca\r\nEspañola_ of Don Juan Sempere. See note p. 593.\r\n\r\n[625] This will be obvious even from a fragment; as, for instance, the\r\nfollowing passage, which occurs in the description of a rustic dance:--\r\n\r\n        Ay! que voluptuosos\r\n    Sus pasos! como animan\r\n    Al mas cobarde amante,\r\n    Y al mas helado irritan!\r\n    Al premio, al dulce premio\r\n    Parece que le brindan\r\n    De amor, quando le ostentan\r\n    Un seno que palpita.\r\n    Quan dócil es su planta!\r\n    Que acorde á la medida\r\n    Va del compas! las Gracias\r\n    Parece que la guian.\r\n    Y ella de frescas rosas\r\n    La blanca sien ceñida\r\n    Su ropa libra al viento,\r\n    Que un manso soplo agita,\r\n    Con timidez donosa\r\n    De Clöe simplecilla\r\n    Por los floridos labios\r\n    Vaga una afable risa.\r\n    A su zagal incauta\r\n    Con blandas carrerillas\r\n    Se llega, y vergonzosa\r\n    Al punto se retira; &c.\r\n\r\n[626] For example, the following short idyl, as it may properly be\r\ndenominated:--\r\n\r\n        Siendo yo niño tierno\r\n    Con la niña Dorila\r\n    Me andaba por la selva\r\n    Cogiendo florecillas,\r\n    De que alegres guirnaldas\r\n    Con gracia peregrina,\r\n    Para ambos coronarnos,\r\n    Su mano disponia.\r\n    Asi en niñeces tales\r\n    De juegas y delicias\r\n    Pasábamos felices\r\n    Las horas y los dias.\r\n    Con ellos poco á poco\r\n    La edad corrió de prisa,\r\n    Y fué de la inocencia\r\n    Saltando la malicia.\r\n    Yo no sé: mas al verme\r\n    Dorila se reia,\r\n    Y á mi de solo hablarla\r\n    Tambien me daba risa.\r\n    Luego al darle las floras\r\n    El pecho me latia,\r\n    Y al ella coronarme\r\n    Quedábase embebida,\r\n    Una tarde tras esto\r\n    Vimos dos tortolillas,\r\n    Que con tremulos picos\r\n    Se halagaban amigas.\r\n    Alentónos su exemplo,\r\n    Y entre honestas caricias\r\n    Nos contamos turbados\r\n    Nuestras dulces fatigas.\r\n    Y en un punto, qual sombra\r\n    Voló de nuestra vista\r\n    La niñez; mas en torno\r\n    Nos dió el Amor sus dichas.\r\n\r\n[627] As a specimen of the Spanish sonnets of this latter period, one\r\nfrom the pen of Melendez may with propriety be chosen in preference to\r\nmany others:--\r\n\r\n        Qual suele abeja inquieta revolando\r\n    Por florido pensil entre mil rosas\r\n    Hasta venir á hallar las mas hermosas\r\n    Andar con dulce trompa susurrando.\r\n        Mas luego que las ve con vuelo blando\r\n    Baxa y bate las alas vagarosas,\r\n    Y en medio de sus venas olorosas\r\n    El delicado aroma está gozando.\r\n        Asi, mi bien, el pensamiento mio\r\n    Con dichosa zozobra por hallarte\r\n    Vagaba de amor libre por el suelo:\r\n        Pero te vi, rendime, y mi albedrio\r\n    Abrasado en tu luz goza al mirarte\r\n    Gracias que envidia de tu rostro el cielo.\r\n\r\n[628] The numerous collection of specimens in this volume, shall close\r\nwith a fragment of this epistle, which deserves to rank among the\r\nproductions that reflect honour on Spanish literature:--\r\n\r\n        ----Oh que de veces\r\n    Mi blando corazon has encendido,\r\n    Jovino, con él, y en làgrimas de gozo\r\n    Nuestras pláticas dulces fenecieron!\r\n    Que de veces tambien en el retiro\r\n    Pacifico las horas del silencio\r\n    A Minerva ofrecimos, y la Diosa\r\n    Nuestra vos escuchó! Las fugitivas\r\n    Horas se deslizaban, y embebidos\r\n    El Alba con el libro aun nos hallaba.\r\n    Pues que, si huyendo del bullicio insano\r\n    En el real jardin.... Adónde, adónde\r\n    Habeis ido momentos deliciosos!\r\n    Disputas agradables, dó habeis ido!\r\n    Tu me llevaste de Minerva al templo:\r\n    Tu me llevaste, y mi pensar, mis luces,\r\n    Mi entusiasmo, mi lira, todo es tuyo.\r\n\r\n[629] _Filosofia de la Eloquencia, por Don Antonio de Capmany_, Madrid\r\n1777, in 8vo.\r\n\r\n[630] He employs, without hesitation, the words _detalle_ (from\r\nthe French _détail_,) and _interesante_ in the sense of the French\r\n_intéressant_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note:\r\n\r\nErrata on page 610 has been incorporated into original.\r\n\r\nObvious printer errors corrected silently.\r\n\r\nInconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.]",
