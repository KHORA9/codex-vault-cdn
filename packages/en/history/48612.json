Note: While the list of charts\r\nmentions a \"Chart X\", no such chart was contained in the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface to the Second Edition\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present edition of this work has been modified to meet the needs of\r\nthe readers of the mid-1950s. The material in the first edition\r\nfollowing page 244 has been removed; it consisted of a chapter hopefully\r\ncalled \"Psychological Warfare and Disarmament.\" A new Part Four,\r\ncomprising three fresh chapters, has been added, representing some of\r\nthe problems confronting students and operators in this field. Pages\r\n1-243 are a reprint from the first edition.\r\n\r\nThis edition, like the first, is the product of field experience. The\r\nauthor has made nine trips abroad, five of them to the Far East, since\r\n1949. He has profited by his meeting with such personalities as Sir\r\nHenry Gurney, the British High Commissioner for the Federation of\r\nMalaya, who was later murdered by the Communists, meetings with\r\nPhilippine, Republic of Korea, Chinese Nationalist, captured Chinese\r\nCommunist and other personalities, as well as by association with such\r\nveterans in the field as General MacArthur's chief psywar expert,\r\nColonel J. Woodall Greene. To Colonel Joseph I. Greene, who died in\r\n1953, the author is indebted as friend and colleague. He owes much to\r\nthe old friends, listed in the original acknowledgment, who offered\r\ntheir advice and comment in many instances.\r\n\r\nMany readers of the first edition wrote helpful letters of comment. Some\r\nof their suggestions have been incorporated here. The translators of the\r\ntwo Argentine editions of this book; the translator of the Japanese\r\nedition, the Hon. Suma Yokachiro; and the translator of the first and\r\nsecond Chinese editions, Mr. Ch'ên En-ch'êng--all of them have made\r\ndirect or indirect improvements in the content or style of the work.\r\n\r\nThe author also wishes to thank his former student, later his former ORO\r\ncolleague, now his wife, Dr. Genevieve Linebarger, for her encouragement\r\nand her advice.\r\n\r\nThe author hopes that, as U. S. agencies and other governments move\r\ntoward a more settled definition of doctrine in this field, a third\r\nedition--a few years from now--may be able to reflect the maturation of\r\npsywar in international affairs. He does not consider the time\r\nappropriate for a fundamental restatement of doctrine; he hopes that\r\nreaders who have suggestions for future definitions of scope, policy, or\r\noperations can communicate these to him for inclusion in later printings\r\nof this book.\r\n\r\n                                                  P.M.A.L.\r\n                                                  _3 August 1954_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is the product of experience rather than research, of\r\nconsultation rather than reading. It is based on my five years of work,\r\nboth as civilian expert and as Army officer, in American psychological\r\nwarfare facilities--at every level from the Joint and Combined Chiefs of\r\nStaff planning phase down to the preparing of spot leaflets for the\r\nAmerican forces in China. Consequently, I have tried to avoid making\r\nthis an original book, and have sought to incorporate those concepts and\r\ndoctrines which found readiest acceptance among the men actually doing\r\nthe job. The responsibility is therefore mine, but not the credit.\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare involves exciting wit-sharpening work. It tends to\r\nattract quick-minded people--men full of ideas. I have talked about\r\npsychological warfare with all sorts of people, all the way from Mr. Mao\r\nTse-tung in Yenan and Ambassador Joseph Davies in Washington to an\r\nengineer corporal in New Zealand and the latrine-coolie, second class,\r\nat our Chungking headquarters. I have seen one New York lawyer get\r\nmentally befuddled and another New York lawyer provide the solution, and\r\nhave seen Pulitzer Prize winners run out of ideas only to have the\r\nstenographers supply them. From all these people I have tried to learn,\r\nand have tried to make this book a patchwork of enthusiastic\r\nrecollection. Fortunately, the material is non-copyright; unfortunately,\r\nI cannot attribute most of these comments or inventions to their\r\noriginal proponents. Perhaps this is just as well: some authors might\r\nobject to being remembered.\r\n\r\nA few indebtednesses stand out with such clarity as to make\r\nacknowledgment a duty. These I wish to list, with the caution that this\r\nlist is not inclusive.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I am indebted to my father, Judge Paul M. W. Linebarger\r\n(1871-1939), who during his lifetime initiated me into almost every\r\nphase of international political warfare, whether covert or overt, in\r\nconnection with his life-long activities on behalf of Sun Yat-sen and\r\nthe Chinese Nationalists. On a limited budget (for years, out of his own\r\npocket) he ran campaigns against imperialism and communism, and for\r\nSino-American friendship and Chinese democracy, in four or five\r\nlanguages at a time. For five and a half years I was his secretary, and\r\nbelieve that this experience has kept me from making this a book of\r\nexclusively American doctrine. There is no better way to learn the\r\npropaganda job than to be whipped thoroughly by someone else's\r\npropaganda.\r\n\r\nSecond only to my debt to my father, my obligation to the War Department\r\nGeneral Staff officers detailed to Psychological Warfare stands forth.\r\nBy sheer good fortune, the United States had an unbroken succession of\r\nintelligent, conscientious, able men assigned to this vital post, and it\r\nwas my own good luck to serve under each of them in turn between 1942\r\nand 1947. They are, in order of assignment: Colonel Percy W. Black,\r\nBrigadier General Oscar N. Solbert, Colonel Charles Blakeney, Lieutenant\r\nColonel Charles Alexander Holmes Thomson, Colonel John Stanley,\r\nLieutenant Colonel Richard Hirsch, Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Buttles,\r\nColonel Dana Johnston, Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Tatum, and Lieutenant\r\nColonel Wesley Edwards. Their talents and backgrounds were diverse but\r\ntheir ability was uniformly high. I do not attribute this to the\r\npeculiar magic of Psychological Warfare, nor to unwonted prescience on\r\nthe part of The Adjutant General, but to plain good luck.\r\n\r\nEspecial thanks are due to the following friends, who have read this\r\nmanuscript in whole or in part. I have dealt independently with the\r\ncomments and criticism, so that none of them can be blamed for the final\r\nform of the book. These are Dr. Edward K. Merat, the Columbia-trained\r\nMIS propaganda analyst; Mr. C. A. H. Thomson, State Department\r\ninternational information consultant and Brookings Institution staff\r\nmember; Professor E. P. Lilly of Catholic University and concurrently\r\nPsychological Warfare historian to the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Lieutenant\r\nColonel Innes Randolph; Lieutenant Colonel Heber Blankenhorn, the only\r\nAmerican to have served as a Psychological Warfare officer in both World\r\nWars; Dr. Alexander M. Leighton, M.D., the psychiatrist and\r\nanthropologist who as a Navy lieutenant commander headed the OWI-MIS\r\nForeign Morale Analysis Division in wartime; Mr. Richard Hirsch; Colonel\r\nDonald Hall, without whose encouragement I would never have finished\r\nthis book; Professor George S. Pettee, whose experience in strategic\r\nintelligence lent special weight to his comment; Colonel Dana Johnston;\r\nMr. Martin Herz, who may some day give the world the full account of the\r\nmysterious Yakzif operations; and Mrs. M. S. Linebarger.\r\n\r\nFurther, I must thank several of my associates in the propaganda\r\nagencies whose thinking proved most stimulating to mine. Mr. Geoffrey\r\nGorer was equally brilliant as colleague and as ally. Dean Edwin Guthrie\r\nbrought insights to Psychological Warfare which were as much the\r\nreflection of a judicious, humane personality as of preeminent\r\npsychological scholarship. Professor W. A. Aiken, himself a historian,\r\nprovided data on the early history of U. S. facilities in World War II.\r\nMr. F. M. Fisher and Mr. Richard Watts, Jr., of the OWI China Outpost,\r\ntogether with their colleagues, taught me a great deal by letting me\r\nshare some of their tasks and my immediate chief in China, Colonel\r\nJoseph K. Dickey, was kind to allow a member of his small, overworked\r\nstaff to give time to Psychological Warfare. Messrs. Herbert Little,\r\nJohn Creedy and C. A. Pearce have told me wonderful stories about their\r\ninteresting end of propaganda. Mr. Joseph C. Grew, formerly Under\r\nSecretary of State and Ambassador to Japan, showed me that the\r\nprocesses of traditional responsible diplomacy include many skills which\r\nPsychological Warfare rediscovers crudely and in different form.\r\n\r\nFinally, I wish to thank Colonel Joseph I. Greene in his triple role of\r\neditor, publisher and friend, to whom this volume owes its actual being.\r\n\r\nWhile this material has been found unobjectionable on the score of\r\nsecurity by the Department of the Army, it certainly does not represent\r\nDepartment of the Army policy, views, or opinion, nor is the Department\r\nresponsible for matters of factual accuracy. I assume sole and complete\r\nresponsibility for this book and would be glad to hear the comment or\r\ncomplaint of any reader. My address is indicated below.\r\n\r\n                    PAUL M. A.

1\r\n\r\nHistoric Examples of Psychological Warfare\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare is waged before, during, and after war; it is not\r\nwaged against the opposing psychological warfare operators; it is not\r\ncontrolled by the laws, usages, and customs of war; and it cannot be\r\ndefined in terms of terrain, order of battle, or named engagements. It\r\nis a continuous process. Success or failure is often known only months\r\nor years after the execution of the operation. Yet success, though\r\nincalculable, can be overwhelming; and failure, though undetectable, can\r\nbe mortal.\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare does not fit readily into familiar concepts of\r\nwar. Military science owes much of its precision and definiteness to its\r\ndealing with a well defined subject, the application of organized lawful\r\nviolence. The officer or soldier can usually undertake his task of\r\napplying mass violence without having to determine upon the enemy. The\r\nopening of war, recognition of neutrals, the listing of enemies,\r\nproclamation of peace--such problems are considered political, and\r\noutside the responsibility of the soldier. Even in the application of\r\nforce short of war, the soldier proceeds only when the character of the\r\nmilitary operation is prescribed by higher (that is, political)\r\nauthorities, and after the enemies are defined by lawful and\r\nauthoritative command. In one field only, psychological warfare, is\r\nthere endless uncertainty as to the very nature of the operation.\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare, by the nature of its instruments and its mission,\r\nbegins long before the declaration of war. Psychological warfare\r\ncontinues after overt hostilities have stopped. The enemy often avoids\r\nidentifying himself in psychological warfare; much of the time, he is\r\ndisguised as the voice of home, of God, of the church, of the friendly\r\npress. Offensively, the psychological warfare operator must fight\r\nantagonists who never answer back--the enemy audience. He cannot fight\r\nthe one enemy who is in plain sight, the hostile psychological warfare\r\noperator, because the hostile operator is greedily receptive to attack.\r\nNeither success nor defeat are measurable factors. Psychological\r\nstrategy is planned along the edge of nightmare.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Understanding Of Psychological Warfare.= In a formal approach to\r\nthis mysterious part of the clean-cut process of war, it might be\r\ndesirable to start with Euclidian demonstrations, proceeding from\r\ndefinition to definition until the subject-matter had been delimited by\r\nlogic. Alternatively it might be interesting to try a historical\r\napproach, describing the development of psychological warfare through\r\nthe ages.\r\n\r\nThe best approach is perhaps afforded by a simplification of both a\r\nlogical and historical approach. For concrete examples it is most\r\nworthwhile to look at instances of psychological warfare taken out of\r\nhistory down to World War II. Then the definitions and working\r\nrelationships can be traced and--with these in mind--a somewhat more\r\ndetailed and critical appraisal of World Wars I and II organizations and\r\noperations can be undertaken. If a historian or philosopher picks up\r\nthis book, he will find much with which to quarrel, but for the survey\r\nof so hard-to-define a subject, this may be a forgivable fault.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 1: A Basic Form of Propaganda._ This American\r\nleaflet, issued during the Philippine landings, was dropped on inhabited\r\nPhilippine areas in order to obtain local civilian cooperation with the\r\nlanding forces. It can be called the \"civilian-action\" type.]\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare and propaganda are each as old as mankind; but it\r\nhas taken modern specialization to bring them into focus as separate\r\nsubjects. The materials for their history lie scattered through\r\nthousands of books and it is therefore impossible to brief them. Any\r\nreader contemplating retirement from the army to a sedentary life is\r\nurged to take up this subject.[1] A history of propaganda would provide\r\nnot only a new light on many otherwise odd or trivial historical events;\r\nit would throw genuine illumination on the process of history itself.\r\nThere are however numerous instances which can be cited to show\r\napplications of psychological warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Use Of Panic By Gideon.= One of the earliest (by traditional\r\nreckoning, 1245 B.C.) applications was Gideon's use of the lamps and\r\npitchers in the great battle against the Midianites.\r\n\r\nThe story is told in the seventh chapter of the Book of Judges. Gideon\r\nwas in a tactically poor position. The Midianites outnumbered him and\r\nwere on the verge of smiting him very thoroughly. Ordinary combat\r\nmethods could not solve the situation, so Gideon--acting upon more\r\nexalted inspiration than is usually vouchsafed modern commanders--took\r\nthe technology and military formality of his time into account.\r\n\r\nRetaining three hundred selected men, he sought for some device which\r\nwould cause real confusion in the enemy host. He knew well that the\r\ntactics of his time called for every century of men to have one\r\nlight-carrier and one torch-bearer for the group. By equipping three\r\nhundred men with a torch and a trumpet each, he could create the effect\r\nof thirty thousand. Since the lights could not be turned on and off with\r\nswitches, like ours, the pitchers concealed them, thus achieving the\r\neffect of suddenness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 2: Nazi Troop Morale Leaflet._ In this leaflet,\r\nused on the Italian front in 1944, the Nazis did not call for any\r\nspecific action from their American GI readers. Their aim was merely\r\ndepression of American morale for future exploitation by action\r\npropaganda. Note the extreme simplicity of the message. Throughout World\r\nWar II, the Nazis were misled by their own tendentious political\r\nintelligence reports and consequently overestimated the kind and degree\r\nof American opposition to Franklin D. Roosevelt. They mistook normal\r\ncomplaint for treasonable sedition; hence, leaflets such as this seemed\r\npractical to the Germans.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 3: One of the Outstanding Leaflets of the War._\r\nPrepared in 1945 for distribution by B-29s operating over Japan, this\r\nleaflet lists eleven Japanese cities which were marked for destruction.\r\nThe leaflet is apparently of the civilian-action type, calling on\r\nJapanese civilians to save their own lives. At the same time, it had the\r\neffect of shutting down eleven strategically important cities, thus\r\nhurting the Japanese war effort while giving the Americans a reputation\r\nfor humanity and also refuting enemy charges that we undertook\r\nindiscriminate bombing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 4: The Pass Which Brought them in._ Germans liked\r\nthings done in an official and formal manner, even in the midst of\r\nchaos, catastrophe and defeat. The Allies obliged, and gave the Germans\r\nvarious forms of very official-looking \"surrender passes,\" of which this\r\nis one. The original is printed in red and has banknote-type engraving\r\nwhich makes it resemble a soap-premium coupon. (Western Front, 1944-45,\r\nissued by SHAEF.)]\r\n\r\nHe had his three hundred men equipped with lamps and pitchers. The lamps\r\nwere concealed in the pitchers, each man carrying one, along with a\r\ntrumpet. He lined his forces in appropriate disposition around the enemy\r\ncamp at night and had them--himself setting the example--break the\r\npitchers all at the same time, while blowing like mad on the trumpets.\r\n\r\nThe Midianites were startled out of their sleep and their wits. They\r\nfought one another throughout their own camp. The Hebrew chronicler\r\nmodestly gives credit for this to the Lord. Then the Midianites gave up\r\naltogether and fled. And the men of Israel pursued after the\r\nMidianites.[2] That settled the Midianite problem for a while; later\r\nGideon finished Midian altogether.\r\n\r\nThis type of psychological warfare device--the use of unfamiliar\r\ninstruments to excite panic--is common in the history of all ancient\r\ncountries. In China, the Emperor-usurper Wang Mang on one occasion tried\r\nto destroy the Hunnish tribes with an army that included heavy\r\ndetachments of military sorcerers, even though the Han Military Emperor\r\nhad found orthodox methods the most reliable; Wang Mang got whipped at\r\nthis. But he was an incurable innovator and in 23 A.D., while trying to\r\nput down some highly successful rebels, he collected all the animals out\r\nof the Imperial menagerie and sent them along to scare the enemy:\r\ntigers, rhinoceri, and elephants were included. The rebels hit first,\r\nkilling the Imperial General Wang Sun, and in the excitement the animals\r\ngot loose in the Imperial army where they panicked the men. A hurricane\r\nwhich happened to be raging at the same time enhanced the excitement.\r\nNot only were the Imperial troops defeated, but the military propaganda\r\nof the rebels was so jubilant in tone and so successful in effect that\r\nthe standard propaganda theme, \"Depress and unnerve the enemy\r\ncommander,\" was fulfilled almost to excess on Wang Mang. Here is what\r\nhappened to him after he noted the progress of the enemy: \"A profound\r\nmelancholy fell upon the Emperor. It undermined his health. He drank to\r\nexcess, ate nothing but oysters, and let everything happen by chance.\r\nUnable to stretch out, he slept sitting up on a bench.\"[3] Wang Mang was\r\nkilled in the same year, and China remained without another economic new\r\ndeal until the time of Wang An-shih (A.D. 1021-1086), a thousand years\r\nlater. Better psychological warfare would have changed history.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Field Propaganda Of The Athenians And The Han.= A more successful\r\napplication of psychological warfare is recorded in the writings of\r\nHerodotus, the Greek historian:\r\n\r\n  Themistocles, having selected the best sailing ships of the Athenians,\r\n  went to the place where there was water fit for drinking, and engraved\r\n  upon the stones inscriptions, which the Ionians, upon arriving the\r\n  next day at Artemisium, read. The inscriptions were to this effect,\r\n  'Men of Ionia, you do wrong in fighting against your fathers and\r\n  helping to enslave Greece. Rather, therefore, come over to us or if\r\n  you cannot do that, withdraw your forces from the contest and entreat\r\n  the Carians to do the same. But if neither of these things is\r\n  possible, and you are bound by too strong a necessity, yet in action,\r\n  when we are engaged, behave ill on purpose, remembering that you are\r\n  descended from us and that the enmity of the barbarians against us\r\n  originally sprang from you.'[4]\r\n\r\nThis text is very much like leaflets dropped during World War II on\r\nreluctant enemies, such as the Italians, the Chinese puppet troops, and\r\nothers. (Compare this Greek text with _Figure 5_.) Note that the\r\npropagandist tries to see things from the viewpoint of his audience. His\r\nair of reasonable concern for their welfare creates a bond of sympathy.\r\nAnd by suggesting that the Ionians should behave badly in combat, he\r\nlays the beginning of another line--the propaganda to the Persians,\r\n\"black\" propaganda making the Persians think that any Ionian who was\r\nless than perfect was a secret Athenian sympathizer. The appeal is sound\r\nby all modern standards of the combat-leaflet.\r\n\r\nAnother type of early military propaganda was the political denunciation\r\nwhich, issued at the beginning of war, could be cited from then on as\r\nlegal and ethical justification for one side or the other. In the\r\nChinese _San Kuo_ novel, which has probably been read by more human\r\nbeings than any other work of fiction, there is preserved the alleged\r\ntext of the proclamation of a group of loyalist pro-Han rebels on the\r\neve of military operations (about A.D. 200). The text is interesting\r\nbecause it combines the following techniques, all of them sound: 1)\r\nnaming the specific enemy; 2) appeal to the \"better people\"; 3) sympathy\r\nfor the common people; 4) claim of support for the legitimate\r\ngovernment; 5) affirmation of one's own strength and high morale; 6)\r\ninvocation of unity; 7) appeal to religion. The issuance of the\r\nproclamation was connected with rather elaborate formal ceremony:\r\n\r\n  The House of Han has fallen upon evil days, the bonds of Imperial\r\n  authority are loosened. The rebel minister, Tung Cho, takes advantage\r\n  of the discord to work evil, and calamity falls upon honorable\r\n  families. Cruelty overwhelms simple folk. We, Shao and his\r\n  confederates, fearing for the safety of the imperial prerogatives,\r\n  have assembled military forces to rescue the State. We now pledge\r\n  ourselves to exert our whole strength, and to act in concord to the\r\n  utmost limit of our powers. There must be no disconcerted or selfish\r\n  action. Should any depart from this pledge may he lose his life and\r\n  leave no posterity. Almighty Heaven and Universal Mother Earth and the\r\n  enlightened spirits of our forefathers, be ye our witnesses.[5]\r\n\r\nAny history of any country will yield further examples of this kind of\r\nmaterial. Whenever it was consciously used as an adjunct to military\r\noperations, it may appropriately be termed military propaganda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 5: Revolutionary Propaganda._ When revolution\r\nfavors one side or the other in war, revolutionary propaganda becomes an\r\ninstrument which is used by one constituted government against another.\r\nThis leaflet was issued by the Azad Hind Fauj (Free India Army) of the\r\nJapanese puppet Subhas Chandra Bose. (Singapore, then called Shonan,\r\n1943 and 1944.) The leaflet avoids direct reference to the Japanese, and\r\nis therefore \"block\" propaganda. Its theme is simple: the British are\r\nalleged to eat while the Hindus starve. At the time, this argument had\r\nsome plausibility. There was famine in Bengal, but no white men were\r\nfound among the thousands of emaciated dead.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Emphasis on Ideology.= In a sense, the experience of the past may,\r\nunfortunately, provide a clue to the future. The last two great wars\r\nhave shown an increasing emphasis on ideology or political faith (see\r\ndefinition, page 30 below) as driving forces behind warfare, rather than\r\nthe considerations of coldly calculated diplomacy. Wars become more\r\nserious, and less gentlemanly; the enemy must be taken into account not\r\nmerely as a man, but as a fanatic. To the normal group-loyalty of any\r\ngood soldier to his army, right or wrong, there is added the loyalty to\r\nthe Ism or the Leader. Warfare thus goes back to the Wars of Faith. It\r\nis possible that techniques from the Christian-Mohammedan or from the\r\nProtestant-Catholic wars of the past could be reëxamined with a view to\r\nestablishing those parts of their tested experience which may seem to\r\nbe psychologically and militarily sound in our own time. How fast can\r\nconverts be made from the other side? In what circumstances should an\r\nenemy word of honor be treated as valid? How can heretics (today, read\r\n\"subversive elements\") be uprooted? Does the enemy faith have weak\r\npoints which permit enemy beliefs to be turned against personnel at the\r\nappropriate times? What unobjectionable forms should leaflets and\r\nbroadcasts follow in mentioning subjects which are reverenced by the\r\nenemy but not by ourselves?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 6: Propaganda for Illiterates._ Propaganda\r\nreached out for the mass audience in World War II. Some of the most\r\ninteresting developments in this line were undertaken by CBI Theater\r\nfacilities and their Japanese competitors. The leaflet shown above is\r\ndesigned to tell its story in Hindustani (Devanagari script) or in\r\nRomanized Hindustani to Indians who could read either form, and in\r\npictures to the illiterates. It starts with the Union Jack and ends with\r\nthe Congress flag used by the puppet pro-Japanese Indian leader, Subhas\r\nChandra Bose.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 7: Propaganda Through News._ News is one of the\r\nbest carriers of psychological warfare to the enemy. One of these\r\nnewspapers is directed by the Allies to the German troops in the Ægean\r\nIslands; the other by the Germans to the Americans in France. Of the\r\ntwo, the Allied paper (in German) is the more professional job. Note the\r\nseparation of appeals from the news, the greater newsiness of the news\r\ncolumns, and the explanation provided for third-party civilians in their\r\nown Greek language (top right).]\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the Islamic Faith-and-Empire provides a great deal of\r\nprocedural information which cannot be neglected in our time. It has\r\nbeen said that men's faith should not be destroyed by violence, and that\r\nforce alone is insufficient to change the minds of men. If this were\r\ntrue, it would mean that Germany can never be de-Nazified, and that\r\nthere is no hope that the democratic peoples captured by totalitarian\r\npowers can adjust themselves to their new overlords or, if adjusted, can\r\nbe converted back to free principles. In reality warfare by Mohammed's\r\ncaptains and successors demonstrated two principles of long-range\r\npsychological warfare which are still valid today:\r\n\r\nA people can be converted from one faith to the other if given the\r\nchoice between conversion and extermination, stubborn individuals being\r\nrooted out. To effect the initial conversion, participation in the\r\npublic ceremonies and formal language of the new faith must be required.\r\nSustained counterintelligence must remain on the alert against\r\nbacksliders, but formal acceptance will become genuine acceptance if all\r\npublic media of expression are denied the vanquished faith.\r\n\r\nIf immediate wholesale conversion would require military operations that\r\nwere too extensive or severe, the same result can be effected by\r\ntoleration of the objectionable faith, combined with the issuance of\r\ngenuine privileges to the new, preferred faith. The conquered people are\r\nleft in the private, humble enjoyment of their old beliefs and folkways;\r\nbut all participation in public life, whether political, cultural or\r\neconomic, is conditioned on acceptance of the new faith. In this manner,\r\nall up-rising members of the society will move in a few generations over\r\nto the new faith in the process of becoming rich, powerful, or learned;\r\nwhat is left of the old faith will be a gutter superstition, possessing\r\nneither power nor majesty.\r\n\r\nThese two rules worked once in the rise of Islam. They were applied\r\nagain by Nazi overlords during World War II, the former in Poland, the\r\nUkraine and Byelorussia, the latter in Holland, Belgium, Norway and\r\nother Western countries. The rules will probably be seen in action\r\nagain. The former process is difficult and bloody, but quick; the latter\r\nis as sure as a steam-roller. If Christians, or democrats, or\r\nprogressives--whatever free men may be called--are put in a position of\r\nunderprivilege and shame for their beliefs, and if the door is left open\r\nto voluntary conversion, so that anyone who wants to can come over to\r\nthe winning side, the winning side will sooner or later convert almost\r\neveryone who is capable of making trouble. (In the language of Vilfredo\r\nPareto, this would probably be termed \"capture of the rising elite\"; in\r\nthe language of present-day Marxists, this would be described as\r\n\"utilization of potential leadership cadres from historically superseded\r\nclasses\"; in the language of practical politics, it means \"cut in the\r\nsmart boys from the opposition, so that they can't set up a racket of\r\ntheir own.\")\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 8: One of the Mongol Secret Weapons._ The Mongol\r\nconquerors used rumor and terror in order to increase their military\r\neffectiveness. Once they came to power, they used spectacular military\r\ndisplays as a means of intimidating conquered peoples. This old French\r\nengraving shows a war-howdah mounted on four elephants allegedly used by\r\nKublai Khan, grandnephew to Genghis Khan and friend of Marco Polo the\r\nVenetian. Obviously impractical for field use, the vehicle is well\r\nsuited for ceremonial display and mere mention of it is a factor for\r\n\"warfare psychologically waged.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Black Propaganda Of Genghis Khan.= Another demonstration of\r\npsychological warfare in the past was so effective that its results\r\nlinger to this day. It is commonly thought that the greatest conqueror\r\nthe world has seen--Temujin, the Genghis Khan--effected his Mongol\r\nconquests with \"limitless hordes\" of wild Tatar horsemen, who flooded\r\nthe world by weight of sheer numbers. Recent research shows that the\r\nsparsely settled countryside of Inner Asia could not have produced\r\npopulations heavy enough to overwhelm the densely settled areas of the\r\ngreat Mongol periphery by weight alone. The empire of the Khan was built\r\non bold military inventiveness--the use of highly mobile forces, the\r\nfull use of intelligence, the coordination of half-global strategy, the\r\napplication of propaganda in all its forms.[6] The Mongols were fighting\r\nthe Sung Dynasty in China and the Holy Roman Empire in Prussia four\r\nthousand miles apart when neither of their adversaries knew (in more\r\nthan rumor) that the other existed. The Mongols used espionage to plan\r\ntheir campaigns and deliberately used rumor and other means to\r\nexaggerate accounts of their own huge numbers, stupidity, and ferocity.\r\nThey did not care what their enemies thought as long as the enemies\r\nbecame frightened. Europeans described light, hard-hitting _numerically\r\ninferior_ cavalry as a \"numberless horde\" because Mongol agents\r\nwhispered such a story in the streets. To this day most Europeans do not\r\nappreciate the lightness of the forces nor the cold intelligence of\r\ncommand with which the Mongols hit them seven centuries ago.\r\n\r\nGenghis even used the spies of the enemy as a means of frightening the\r\nenemy. When spies were at hand he indoctrinated them with rumors\r\nconcerning his own forces. Let the first European biographer of Genghis\r\ntell, in his own now-quaint words, how Genghis put the bee on Khorezm\r\n(Carizme):\r\n\r\n  And a Historian, to describe their Strength and Number, makes the\r\n  Spies whom the King of _Carizme_ had sent to view them, speak thus:\r\n  They are, say they to the Sultan, all compleat Men, vigorous, and look\r\n  like Wrestlers; they breathe nothing but War and Blood, and show so\r\n  great an Impatience to fight, that the Generals can scarce moderate\r\n  it; yet though they appear thus fiery, they keep themselves within the\r\n  bounds of a strict Obedience to Command, and are intirely devoted to\r\n  their Prince; they are contented with any sort of Food, and are not\r\n  curious in the choice of Beasts to eat, like Mussulmen [Mohammedans],\r\n  so that they are subsisted without much trouble; and they not only eat\r\n  Swines-Flesh, but feed upon Wolves, Bears, and Dogs, when they have no\r\n  other Meat, making no distinction between what was lawful to eat, and\r\n  what was forbidden; and the Necessity for supporting Life takes from\r\n  them all the Dislike which the _Mahometans_ have for many sorts of\r\n  Animals; As to their Number, (they concluded) _Genghizcan's_ Troops\r\n  seem'd like the Grasshoppers, impossible to be number'd.\r\n\r\n  In reality, this Prince making a Review of his Army, found it to\r\n  consist of seven hundred thousand men....[7]\r\n\r\nEnemy espionage can now--as formerly--prove useful if the net effect of\r\nit is to lower enemy morale. The ruler and people of Khorezm put up a\r\nterrific fight, nevertheless, despite their expectation of being\r\nattacked by wolf-eating wrestlers without number; but they left the\r\ninitiative in Genghis' hands and were doomed.\r\n\r\nHowever good the Mongols were in strategic and tactical propaganda,\r\nthey never solved the problem of consolidation propaganda (see page 46,\r\nbelow). They did not win the real loyalty of the peoples whom they\r\nconquered; unlike the Chinese, who replaced conquered populations with\r\ntheir own people, or the Mohammedans, who converted conquered peoples,\r\nthe Mongols simply maintained law and order, collected taxes, and sat on\r\ntop of the world for a few generations. Then their world stirred beneath\r\nthem, and they were gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Blindness Of John Milton.= Moving across the centuries for an\r\nexample, it is interesting to note that John Milton, author of _Paradise\r\nLost_ and of other priceless books of the English-speaking world, went\r\nblind because he was so busy conducting Oliver Cromwell's psychological\r\nwarfare that he disregarded the doctors' warning and abused his ailing\r\nsight. And the sad thing about it was that it was not very good\r\npsychological warfare.\r\n\r\nMilton fell into the common booby-trap of refuting his opponents item by\r\nitem, thus leaving them the strong affirmative position, instead of\r\nproviding a positive and teachable statement of his own faith. He was\r\nLatin Secretary to the Council, in that Commonwealth of England which\r\nwas--to its contemporaries in Europe--such a novel, dreadful, and\r\nseditious form of government. The English had killed their king, by\r\nsomewhat offhanded legal procedures, and had gone under the Cromwellian\r\ndictatorship. It was possible for their opponents to attack them from\r\ntwo sides at once. Believers in monarchy could call the English\r\nmurderous king-killers (a charge as serious in those times as the charge\r\nof anarchism or free love in this); believers in order and liberty could\r\ncall the British slaves of a tyrant. A Frenchman called Claude de\r\nSaumaise (in Latin form, Salmasius) wrote a highly critical book about\r\nthe English, and Milton seems to have lost his temper and his judgment.\r\n\r\nIn his two books against Salmasius, Milton then committed almost every\r\nmistake in the whole schedule of psychological warfare. He moved from\r\nhis own ground of argument over to the enemy's. He wrote at excessive\r\nlength. He indulged in some of the nastiest name-calling to be found in\r\nliterature, and went into considerable detail to describe Salmasius in\r\nunattractive terms. He slung mud whenever he could. The books are read\r\ntoday, under compulsion, by Ph.D. candidates, but no one else is known\r\nto find them attractive. It is not possible to find that these books had\r\nany lasting influence in their own time. (In these texts written by\r\nMilton in Latin but now available in English, Army men wearying of the\r\nmonotonous phraseology of basic military invective can find extensive\r\nadditions to their vocabulary.) Milton turned to disappointment and\r\npoetry; the world is the gainer.\r\n\r\nThe vocabulary of seventeenth-century propaganda had a strident tone\r\nwhich is, perhaps unfortunately, getting to be characteristic of the\r\ntwentieth century. The following epithets sound like an American Legion\r\ndescription of Communists, or a Communist description of the Polish\r\ndemocrats, yet they were applied in a book by a Lutheran to Quakers. The\r\ntitle of the tirade reads, in part:\r\n\r\n  ... a description of the ... new Quakers, making known the sum of\r\n  their manifold blasphemous opinions, dangerous practices, Godless\r\n  crimes, attempts to subvert civil government in the churches and in\r\n  the community life of the world; together with their idiotic games,\r\n  their laughable action and behavior, which is enough to make sober\r\n  Christian persons breathless, and which is like death, and which can\r\n  display the lazy stinking cadaver of their fanatical doctrines....\r\n\r\nIn its first few pages, the book accuses the Quakers of obscenity,\r\nadultery, civil commotion, conspiracy, blasphemy, subversion and\r\nlunacy.[8] Milton was not out of fashion in applying bad manners to\r\npropaganda. It is merely regrettable that he did not transcend the\r\nfrailties of his time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Instances From History.= Innumerable other instances of\r\npropaganda in warfare and diplomacy could be culled out of history;\r\nthese would not mean much if they were presented as mere story-telling.\r\nThe cultural factors would have to be figured out; the military\r\nsituation would need to be appraised in realistic terms; the media\r\navailable for psychological warfare would have to be charted pretty\r\ncarefully, before the instances would become usable examples. Here are\r\nsome of the most promising topics:\r\n\r\nNaval psychological warfare techniques used by the Caribbean pirates to\r\nunnerve prospective victims.\r\n\r\nCortez's use of horses as psychological disseminators of terror among\r\nthe Aztecs, along with his exploitation of Mexican legends concerning\r\nthe Fair God.\r\n\r\nThe failure of Turkish psychological warfare in the great campaigns of\r\n1683 which left the issue one of purely physical means and cost Turkey\r\nthe possible hegemony of central Europe.\r\n\r\nThe propaganda methods of the British East India Company in the conquest\r\nof India against overwhelming Indian numerical superiority. (Edmond\r\nTaylor mentions these in his _Richer by Asia_.)\r\n\r\nThe preventive psychological warfare system set up by the Tokugawa\r\nshoguns after 1636, which bottled up the brains of the Japanese through\r\nmore rigorous control than has ever been established elsewhere over\r\ncivilized people.\r\n\r\nThe field psychological warfare of the Manchus, who conquered China\r\nagainst odds running as much as 400 to one against them, and who used\r\nterror as a means of nullifying Chinese superiority.\r\n\r\nThe propaganda of the European feudal classes against the peasant\r\nrevolts, which identified the peasants with filth, anarchy, murder, and\r\ncruelty.\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition considered as a psychological warfare facility of the\r\nSpanish Empire.\r\n\r\nThe agitational practices of the French Revolutionaries.\r\n\r\nEarly uses of rockets and balloons for psychological effect.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of leaflet-printing as an adjunct to field operations.\r\n\r\nSuch a list just begins to touch on subjects which can and should be\r\ninvestigated, either as staff studies or by civilian historians.\r\nCollection of the materials and framing of sound doctrines for\r\npsychological warfare are no minor task.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 9: Black Propaganda from the British Underground,\r\n1690._ When William of Orange took the crown of England away from the\r\ntimid rascal, James II, he met opposition from the Loyalists devoted to\r\nthe Stuarts. This broadsheet demonstrates an early form of black\r\npropaganda. It also provides a good instance of propaganda material\r\nborrowing a familiar form of expression in order to get its message\r\nacross, in this case, the tradesman's enumeration of debit and credit.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 10: Secret American Propaganda Subverting the\r\nRedcoats._ Readers of Charles Dickens' great novel, _Barnaby Rudge_,\r\nwill remember that anti-Catholicism was a lively propaganda issue in\r\nEngland at the time of the American Revolution. This American propaganda\r\navoids discussion of the theme of American independence--a topic on\r\nwhich Englishmen were liable to hold united opinions--and instead\r\nattempts to subvert British troops by means of the anti-Catholic appeal.\r\n(Original source unknown; from War Department files. Probable date,\r\n1775.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 11: Desertion Leaflet from Bunker Hill._ This\r\nleaflet is as valid today as the day it was written. No source is\r\nindicated, but neither is any attempt made to suggest a false source\r\ndifferent from the true one; it is in modern parlance \"grey\" propaganda.\r\nWealth, food, health and economic status are played up simultaneously;\r\ndifficult political issues are not argued--they are sidestepped.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The American Revolution.= In the American Revolution, psychological\r\nwarfare played a very important role. The Whig campaign of propaganda\r\nwhich led up to colonial defiance of Britain was energetic and expert in\r\ncharacter, and the very opening of hostilities was marked by passionate\r\nappeals to the civilian population in the form of handbills. The\r\nAmerican forces at the Battle of Bunker Hill used one of the earliest\r\nversions of front-line combat propaganda (see Figure 11). The appeal was\r\nas direct as could be wished. Artful use was made of the sharp class\r\ndistinctions then existing between British officers and enlisted men;\r\nfear was exploited as an aid to persuasion; the language was pointed.\r\nEven in our own time, the Bunker Hill propaganda leaflet stands as a\r\nclassic example of how to do good field propaganda.\r\n\r\nThe Americans made extensive use of the press.[9] When the newspaper\r\nproprietors veered too far to the Loyalist side, they were warned to\r\nkeep to a more Patriotic line. If, in the face of counter-threats from\r\nthe Loyalists, the newspaper threatened going out of business\r\naltogether, it was warned that suspension of publication would be\r\ntaken as treason to America. The Whigs, before hostilities, and their\r\nsuccessors, the Patriots of the war period, showed a keen interest in\r\nkeeping the press going and in making sure that their side of the story\r\ngot out and got circulated rapidly. In intimidation and control of the\r\npress, they far outdistanced the British, whose papers circulated\r\nchiefly within the big cities held as British citadels throughout the\r\nwar. Political reasoning, economic arguments, allegations concerning the\r\ncourse of the war, and atrocity stories all played a role.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 12: Money as a Carrier of Propaganda._ The note\r\non the left above is French revolutionary currency; observe the use of\r\nrevolutionary slogans. Next to it is the famous Russian 10,000 ruble\r\nbill which calls for the world revolution in seven languages. The\r\nJapanese peso note (at top of page 22) carries American propaganda on\r\nthe reverse; captured notes were overprinted by Psychological Warfare\r\nBranch during the Philippine campaign and dropped back on the enemy. The\r\ntwo five-rupee notes date from the Japanese occupation of Burma. The\r\nlower of the two was issued by Americans as a means of deriding the\r\nJapanese.]\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington himself, as commander of the Continental forces,\r\nshowed a keen interest in war propaganda and in his just, moderate\r\npolitical and military measures provided a policy base from which\r\nPatriot propagandists could operate.\r\n\r\nSome wars are profoundly affected by a book written on one side or the\r\nother; the American revolutionary war was one of these. Thomas Paine's\r\n_Common Sense_ (issued as a widely sold series of pamphlets) swept\r\nAmerican opinion like wildfire; it stated some of the fundamentals of\r\nAmerican thinking, and put its bold but reasonable revolutionary case in\r\nsuch simple terms that even conservatives in the Patriot group could not\r\nresist using it for propaganda purposes.[10] _Common Sense_ has become a\r\nclassic of American literature, but it has its place in history too, as\r\n\"the book that won the war.\" Other pamphleteers, with the redoubtable\r\nSam Adams in the lead, also did well.\r\n\r\nAmerican experience in the Mexican war was less glorious. The Mexicans\r\nwaged psychological warfare against us with considerable effect, ending\r\nup with traitor American artillerymen dealing out heavy murder to the\r\nAmerican troops outside Mexico city. Historians in both countries gloss\r\nover the treason and subversion which occurred on each side.\r\n\r\nIn the Civil War, psychological warfare was practised by both Lincoln\r\nand the Confederacy in establishing propaganda instrumentalities in\r\nEngland and on the continent of Europe. The Northern use of Negro\r\ntroops, which was followed, at the end of the war by the Confederate\r\nplans for raising Negro troops, did not become the major propaganda\r\nissue it might have because of the community of feeling on the two\r\nsides, indecision on each side as to the purpose of the war (apart from\r\nthe basic issue of union or disunion), and the persistence of\r\npolitics-as-usual both North and South of the battle line.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Boers And Burmese.= In the latter part of the nineteenth century, two\r\nsets of British wars indicate the effect psychological warfare can play.\r\nThe British conquered both Burma and the Boers. The Burmese were more\r\nnumerous, had the larger country, and (if they had had leadership\r\ncomparable to the Japanese leadership of the time) could have developed\r\nthe larger military potential. But Burma was conquered by the British in\r\na final war which went on quietly and ingloriously. No nation came to\r\ntheir aid. They did not even get a chance to surrender. The British\r\nsimply ended the war in the middle by announcing the end of the Burmese\r\ngovernment, and by making a one-sided declaration that Burma was annexed\r\nto the Empire of India. The political death of Burma occurred on 1\r\nJanuary 1886, but the event has been forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe Boers, on the other hand, made a stir throughout the world. They got\r\nin touch with the Germans, Irish, Americans, French, Dutch, and\r\neverybody else who might criticize Britain. They stated their case\r\nloudly and often. They waged commando warfare, adding the word\r\n_commando_ to international military parlance, and sent small units deep\r\ninto the British rear, setting off a mad uproar and making the world\r\npress go crazy with excitement. When they finally gave in, it was on\r\nreasonable terms for themselves; they left the British with an\r\ninternationally blacked eye.\r\n\r\nNobody remembered the Burmese; everybody remembered the Boers. The Boers\r\nused every means they could think of; they did everything they could.\r\nThey even captured Winston Churchill.\r\n\r\nThese examples may show that the military role of propaganda and related\r\noperations is not as obscure or intangible as it may have seemed. They\r\ncannot be considered history but must be regarded as a plea for the\r\nwriting of history. More recent experience is another question, and\r\ninvolves tracing the doctrines pertaining to psychological warfare which\r\nhave now become established military procedure in the modern armies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2\r\n\r\nThe Function of Psychological Warfare\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare in the broad sense, consists of the application of\r\nparts of the science called psychology to the conduct of war; in the\r\nnarrow sense, psychological warfare comprises the use of propaganda\r\nagainst an enemy, together with such military operational measures as\r\nmay supplement the propaganda. Propaganda may be described, in turn, as\r\norganized persuasion by non-violent means. War itself may be considered\r\nto be, among other things, a violent form of persuasion. Thus if an\r\nAmerican fire-raid burns up a Japanese city, the burning is calculated\r\nto dissuade the Japanese from further warfare by denying the Japanese\r\nfurther physical means of war and by simultaneously hurting them enough\r\nto cause surrender. If, after the fire-raid, we drop leaflets telling\r\nthem to surrender, the propaganda can be considered an extension of\r\npersuasion--less violent this time, and usually less effective, but\r\nnevertheless an integral part of the single process of making the enemy\r\nstop fighting.\r\n\r\nNeither warfare nor psychology is a new subject. Each is as old as man.\r\nWarfare, being the more practical and plain subject, has a far older\r\nwritten history. This is especially the case since much of what is now\r\ncalled psychology was formerly studied under the heading of religion,\r\nethics, literature, politics, or medicine. Modern psychological warfare\r\nhas become self-conscious in using modern scientific psychology as a\r\ntool.\r\n\r\nIn World War II the enemies of the United States were more fanatical\r\nthan the people and leaders of the United States. The consequence was\r\nthat the Americans could use and apply any expedient psychological\r\nweapon which either science or our version of common sense provided. We\r\ndid not have to square it with Emperor myths, the Führer principle or\r\nsome other rigid, fanatical philosophy. The enemy enjoyed the positive\r\nadvantage of having an indoctrinated army and people; we enjoyed the\r\ncountervailing advantage of having skeptical people, with no inward\r\ntheology that hampered our propaganda operations. It is no negligible\r\nmatter to be able to use the latest findings of psychological science in\r\na swift, bold manner. The scientific character of our psychology puts us\r\nahead of opponents wrapped up in dogmatism who must check their\r\npropaganda against such articles of faith as Aryan racialism or the\r\nHegelian philosophy of history.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Psychological Warfare as a Branch of Psychology.= Good propaganda can\r\nbe conducted by persons with no knowledge of formal psychology. The\r\nhuman touch, the inventive mind, the forceful appeal--things such as\r\nthese appear in the writings of gifted persons. Thomas Paine never read\r\na word of Freud or Pavlov, yet Paine's arguments during the\r\nRevolutionary War played subtly on every appeal which a modern\r\npsychologist could catalogue. But war cannot, in modern times, assume a\r\nstatistical expectation of talent. Psychology makes it possible for the\r\nable but ordinary statesman or officer to calculate his persuasion\r\nsystematically and to obtain by planning those results which greater men\r\nmight hit upon by genius.\r\n\r\nWhat can psychology do for warfare?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the psychologist can bring to the attention of the\r\nsoldier those elements of the human mind which are usually kept out of\r\nsight. He can show how to convert lust into resentment, individual\r\nresourcefulness into mass cowardice, friction into distrust, prejudice\r\ninto fury. He does so by going down to the _unconscious_ mind for his\r\nsource materials. (During world War II, the fact that Chinese babies\r\nremain unimpeded while they commit a nuisance, while Japanese babies are\r\neither intercepted or punished if they make a mess in the wrong place,\r\nwas found to be of significant importance in planning psychological\r\nwarfare. See below, page 154.)\r\n\r\nIn the second place the psychologist can set up techniques for finding\r\nout how the enemy really does feel. Some of the worst blunders of\r\nhistory have arisen from miscalculation of the enemy state of mind. By\r\nusing the familiar statistical and questionnaire procedures, the\r\npsychologist can quiz a small cross section of enemy prisoners and from\r\nthe results estimate the mentality of an entire enemy theater of war at\r\na given period. If he does not have the prisoners handy, he can\r\naccomplish much the same end by an analysis of the news and propaganda\r\nwhich the enemy authorities transmit to their own troops and people. By\r\nestablishing enemy opinion and morale factors he can hazard a reasoned\r\nforecast as to how the enemy troops will behave under specific\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, the psychologist can help the military psychological\r\nwarfare operator by helping him maintain his sense of mission and of\r\nproportion. The deadliest danger of propaganda consists of its being\r\nissued by the propagandist for his own edification. This sterile and\r\nineffectual amusement can disguise the complete failure of the\r\npropaganda _as_ propaganda. There is a genuine pleasure in talking back,\r\nparticularly to an enemy. The propagandist, especially in wartime, is\r\napt to tell the enemy what he thinks of him, or to deride enemy\r\nweaknesses. But to have told the Nazis, for example, \"You Germans are a\r\npack of murderous baboons and your Hitler is a demented oaf. Your women\r\nare slobs, your children are halfwits, your literature is gibberish and\r\nyour cooking is garbage,\" and so on, would have stiffened the German\r\nwill to fight. The propagandist must tell the enemy those things which\r\nthe enemy will heed; he must keep his private emotionalism out of the\r\noperation. The psychologist can teach the propaganda operator how to be\r\nobjective, systematic, cold. For combat operations, it does not matter\r\nhow much a division commander may dislike the enemy; for psychological\r\nwarfare purposes, he must consider how to persuade them, even though he\r\nmay privately thirst for their destruction. The indulgence of hatred is\r\nnot a working part of the soldier's mission; to some it may be helpful;\r\nto others, not. The useful mission consists solely of making the enemy\r\nstop fighting, by combat or other means. But when the soldier turns to\r\npropaganda, he may need the advice of a psychologist in keeping his own\r\nfeelings out of it.\r\n\r\nFinally, the psychologist can prescribe media--radio, leaflets,\r\nloudspeakers, whispering agents, returned enemy soldiers, and so forth.\r\nHe can indicate when and when not to use any given medium. He can, in\r\nconjunction with operations and intelligence officers, plan the full use\r\nof all available psychological resources. He can coordinate the timing\r\nof propaganda with military, economic or political situations.\r\n\r\nThe psychologist does not have to be present in person to give this\r\nadvice. He does not have to be a man with an M.D. or Ph. D. and years of\r\npostgraduate training. He can be present in the manuals he writes, in\r\nthe indoctrination courses for psychological warfare officers he sets\r\nup, in the current propaganda line he dictates by radio. It is useful to\r\nhave him in the field, particularly at the higher command headquarters,\r\nbut he is not indispensable. The psychologist in person can be dispensed\r\nwith; the methods of scientific psychology cannot. (Further on,\r\nthroughout this book, reference will be made to current psychological\r\nliterature. The general history of psychology is described in readable\r\nterms in Gregory Zilboorg and George W. Henry, _A History of Medical\r\nPsychology_, New York, 1941, and in Lowell S. Selling, _Men Against\r\nMadness_, New York, 1940, cheap edition, 1942.)\r\n\r\nPropaganda can be conducted by rule of thumb. But only a genius can make\r\nit work well by playing his hunches. It can become true psychological\r\nwarfare, scientific in spirit and developed as a teachable skill, only\r\nby having its premises clearly stated, its mission defined, its\r\ninstruments put in systematic readiness, and its operations subject to\r\nat least partial check, only by the use of techniques borrowed from\r\nscience. Of all the sciences, psychology is the nearest, though\r\nanthropology, sociology, political science, economics, area studies and\r\nother specialties all have something to contribute; but it is psychology\r\nwhich indicates the need of the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Psychological Warfare as a Part of War.= An infantry officer does not\r\nneed to study the whole nature of war, in order to find his own job.\r\nTradition, military skill, discipline, sound doctrine--these have done\r\nthe job for him. Sun Tzu, Vegetius, Frederick, Clausewitz and a host of\r\nlesser writers on war have established the place of combat in war, and\r\nhave appraised its general character.\r\n\r\nHow much the traditional doctrines may be altered in the terrible light\r\nof atomic explosion, no one knows; but though the weapons are novel, the\r\nwielders of the weapons will still be men. The motives and weaknesses\r\nwithin war remain ancient and human, however novel and dreadful the\r\nmechanical expedients adopted to express them.\r\n\r\nWarfare as a whole is traditionally well defined, and psychological\r\nwarfare can be understood only in relation to the whole process. It is\r\nno mere tool, to be used on special occasion. It has become a pervasive\r\nelement in the military and security situation of every power on earth.\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare is a part of war. The simplest, plainest thing\r\nwhich can be said of war--any sort of war, anywhere, anytime--is that it\r\nis _an official fight between men_. Combat, killing, and even\r\nlarge-scale group struggle are known elsewhere in the animal kingdom,\r\nbut war is not. All sorts of creatures fight; but only men declare,\r\nwage, and terminate war; and they do so only against other men.\r\n\r\nFormally, war may be defined as the \"reciprocal application of violence\r\nby public, armed bodies.\"\r\n\r\nIf it is not _reciprocal_, it is not war, the killing of persons who do\r\nnot defend themselves is not war, but slaughter, massacre, or\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nIf the bodies involved are not _public_, their violence is not war. Even\r\nour enemies in World War II were relatively careful about this\r\ndistinction, because they did not know how soon or easily a violation of\r\nthe rules might be scored against them. To be public, the combatants\r\nneed not be legal--that is, constitutionally set up; it suffices,\r\naccording to international usage, for the fighters to have a reasonable\r\nminimum of numbers, some kind of identification, and a purpose which is\r\npolitical. If you shoot your neighbor, you will be committing mere\r\nmurder; but if you gather twenty or thirty friends, together, tie a red\r\nhandkerchief around the left arm of each man, announce that you are out\r\nto overthrow the government of the United States, and _then_ shoot your\r\nneighbor as a counterrevolutionary impediment to the new order of\r\nthings, you can have the satisfaction of having waged war. (In practical\r\nterms, this means that you will be put to death for treason and\r\nrebellion, not merely for murder.)\r\n\r\nFinally, war must be _violent_. According to the law of modern states,\r\nall the way from Iceland to the Yemen, economic, political, or moral\r\npressure is not war; war is the legalization, in behalf of the state, of\r\nthings which no individual may lawfully do in time of peace. As a matter\r\nof fact, even in time of war you cannot kill the enemy unless you do so\r\non behalf of the state; if you had shot a Japanese creditor of yours\r\nprivately, or even shot a Japanese soldier when you yourself were out of\r\nuniform, you might properly and lawfully have been put to death for\r\nmurder--either by our courts or by the enemies'. (This is among the\r\ncharges which recur in the war trials. The Germans and Japanese killed\r\npersons whom even war did not entitle them to kill.)\r\n\r\nThe governments of the modern world are jealous of their own monopoly of\r\nviolence. War is the highest exercise of that violence, and modern war\r\nis no simple reversion to savagery. The General Staffs would not be\r\nneeded if war were only an uncomplicated orgy of homicide--a mere\r\ngetting-mad and throat-cutting season in the life of man. Quite to the\r\ncontrary, modern war--as a function of modern society--reflects the\r\ninstitutional, political complexity from which it comes. A modern battle\r\nis a formal, ceremonialized and technically intricate operation. You\r\nmust kill just the right people, in just the right way, with the right\r\ntiming, in the proper place, for avowed purposes. Otherwise you make a\r\nmess of the whole show, and--what is worse--you lose.\r\n\r\nWhy must you fight just so and so, there and not here, now and not then?\r\nThe answer is simple: you are fighting against _men_. Your purpose in\r\nfighting is to make them change their minds. It is figuratively true to\r\nsay that the war we have just won was a peculiar kind of advertising\r\ncampaign, designed to make the Germans and Japanese like us and our way\r\nof doing things. They did not like us much, but we gave them\r\nalternatives far worse than liking us, so that they became peaceful.\r\n\r\nSometimes individuals will be unpersuadable. Then they must be killed or\r\nneutralized by other purely physical means--such as isolation or\r\nimprisonment. (Some Nazis, perhaps including the Führer himself, found\r\nour world repellent or incomprehensible and died because they could not\r\nmake themselves surrender. In the Pacific many Japanese had to be killed\r\nbefore they became acceptable to us.) But such is man, that most\r\nindividuals will stop fighting at some point short of extinction; that\r\npoint is reached when one of two things happens:\r\n\r\n  Either, the defeated people may lose their sense of organization, fail\r\n  to decide on leaders and methods, and give up because they can no\r\n  longer fight as a group. This happened to the American Southerners in\r\n  April, 1865. The President and Cabinet of the Confederate States of\r\n  America got on the train at Richmond; the men who got off farther\r\n  down the line were \"refugees.\" Something happened to them and to the\r\n  people about them, so that Mr. Davis no longer thought of himself as\r\n  President Davis, and other people no longer accepted his commands.\r\n  This almost happened in Germany in 1945 except for Admiral Doenitz.\r\n\r\n  Or, the defeated people can retain their sense of organization, and\r\n  can use their political organization for the purpose of getting in\r\n  touch with the enemy, arranging the end of the war, and preparing,\r\n  through organized means, to comply with the wishes of the conquerors.\r\n  That happened when Britain acknowledged American independence; when\r\n  the Boers recognized British sovereignty; when Finland signed what\r\n  Russia had dictated; and when Japan gave up.\r\n\r\nSometimes these things are mixed. The people might wish to make peace,\r\nbut may find that their government is not recognized by the enemy. Or\r\nthe victors may think that they have smashed the enemy government, when\r\nthe new organization is simply the old one under a slightly different\r\nname, but with the old leaders and the old ideas still prevailing.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that whatever happens wars are fought to effect a\r\npsychological change in the antagonist. They are then fought for a\r\npsychological end unless they are wars of extermination. These are rare.\r\nThe United States could not find a people on the face of the earth whose\r\nideas and language were unknown to all Americans. Where there is a\r\nchance of communication, there is always the probability that one of the\r\nantagonistic organizations (governments)--which have already cooperated\r\nto the extent of meeting one another's wishes to fight--will\r\nsubsequently cooperate on terms of primary advantage to the victors.\r\nSince the organizations comprise human beings with human ways of doing\r\nthings, the change must take place in the minds of those specific\r\nindividuals who operate the existing government, or in the minds of\r\nenough other people for that government to be overthrown.\r\n\r\nThe fact that war is waged against the minds, not the bodies, of the\r\nenemy is attested by the comments of military writers of all periods.\r\nThe dictum of Carl von Clausewitz that \"war is politics continued by\r\nother means\" is simply the modern expression of a truth recognized since\r\nantiquity. War is a kind of persuasion--uneconomical, dangerous, and\r\nunpleasant, but effective when all else fails.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ideology.= An ideology is a system of deep-rooted beliefs about\r\nfundamental questions in human life and affairs.[11] Ideology also plays\r\na part in psychological warfare. A difference in beliefs which does not\r\ntouch fundamentals is commonly termed a difference of _opinion_. You may\r\nbelieve in high tariffs; and I, in no tariff. You may believe in One\r\nWorld; I may not. You may support Republicans; I, Democrats. Despite\r\nthese differences both of us can still believe in dollars as a method of\r\npaying income, in marriage as a system of setting up the family, in\r\nprivate property for most goods industrial or personal, in the\r\nGovernment of the United States, in majority rule, in democratic\r\nelections, in free speech, and so on.\r\n\r\nIf our difference of opinion is so inclusive that we can agree on\r\nnothing political, our differences have gone from mere opinion into the\r\ndepths of _ideology_. Here the institutional framework is affected. You\r\nand I would not want to live in the same city; we could not feel safe in\r\none another's presence; each would be afraid of the effect which the\r\nother might have on the morals of the community. If I were a Nazi, and\r\nyou a democrat, you would not like the idea of my children living next\r\ndoor to yours. If I believed that you were a good enough creature--poor\r\ndeluded devil--but that you were not fit to vote, scarcely to be trusted\r\nwith property, not to be trusted as an army officer, and generally\r\nsubversive and dangerous, you would find it hard to get along with me.\r\n\r\nIt was not metaphysical theories that made Protestants and Catholics\r\nburn one another's adherents as heretics in early wars. In the\r\nseventeenth century, the Protestants knew perfectly well what would\r\nhappen if the Catholics got the upper hand, and the Catholics knew what\r\nwould happen if the Protestants came to power. In each case the new\r\nrulers, fearful that they might be overthrown, would have suppressed the\r\nformer rulers, and would have used the rack, the stake, and the dungeon\r\nas preventives of counterrevolution. Freedom cannot be accorded to\r\npersons outside the ideological pale. If an antagonist is not going to\r\nrespect your freedom of speech, your property, and your personal safety,\r\nthen you are not obliged to respect his. The absolute minimum of any\r\nideology is the assumption that each person living in an ideologically\r\nuniform area (what the Nazi General Haushofer, following Rudolf Kjellen,\r\nwould call a _geo-psychic_ zone) will respect the personal safety, etc.,\r\nof other individuals in the same area.\r\n\r\nIn our own time, we have seen Spaniards get more and more mistrustful of\r\none another, until years of ferocious civil war were necessary before\r\none of the two factions could feel safe. Spain went from republican\r\nunity to dictatorial unity in four years; in neither case was the unity\r\nperfect, but it was enough to give one government and one educational\r\nsystem control of most of the country. The other countries of the world\r\nvary in the degree of their ideological cohesion. Scandinavia seemed\r\nserene until the German invasion brought to the surface cleavages,\r\nlatent and unseen, which made Quisling a quisling. Russia, Italy,\r\nGermany and various other states have made a fetish of their ideologies\r\nand have tried to define orthodoxy and heresy in such a way as to be\r\nsure of the mentality of all their people. But most of the countries of\r\nthe world suffer from a considerable degree of ideological confusion--of\r\ninstability of basic beliefs--without having any immediate remedy at\r\nhand, or even seeking one.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Education.= Education is a process usually institutional by which the\r\npeople of a given area transmit to their successors, their own children,\r\nthe purely practical information needed in modern life, together with a\r\nlot of other teachings designed to make good men and women, good\r\ncitizens, good Christians or other believers, of them. In the democratic\r\nstates this process is ideological only in some parts of the curriculum;\r\nelsewhere in the field of opinions, the government seeks to control\r\nideology only negatively--through laws concerning obscenity, blasphemy,\r\nsubversion, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn the states which are ideologically self-conscious and anxious to\r\npromote a fixed mentality, the process of education is combined with\r\nagitation and regulation, so that the entire population lives under\r\nconditions approximating the psychological side of war. Heretics are put\r\nto death or are otherwise silenced. Historical materialism and the\r\nMarxian \"objectivity,\" or the _Volk_, or _Fascismo_, or\r\n_Yamato-damashii_, or \"new democracy\" is set up as the touchstone of all\r\ngood and evil, even in unrelated fields of activity. Education and\r\npropaganda merge into everlasting indoctrination. And when such states\r\ngo to war against states which do not have propaganda machinery, the\r\nmore liberal states are at a disadvantage for sheer lack of practice in\r\nthe administrative and mechanical aspects of propaganda. Education is to\r\npsychological warfare what a glacier is to an avalanche. The mind is to\r\nbe in both cases captured, but the speed and techniques differ.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Salesmanship.= Salesmanship is related to psychological warfare.\r\nPropaganda is often compared to another art of our time--industrialized\r\nsalesmanship through mass printing and telecommunications. This bad\r\nparallel was responsible for much of the inept American propaganda\r\noverseas in the early part of the war; some of our propagandists had a\r\nfundamental misconception of the nature of wartime propaganda.\r\n\r\nAllegiance in war is a matter of ideology, not of opinion. A man cannot\r\nwant his own side to lose while remaining a good citizen in all other\r\nrespects. The desire for defeat--even the acceptance of defeat--is of\r\ntragic importance to any responsible, sane person. A German who wanted\r\nthe Reich to be overthrown was a traitor to Germany, just as any\r\nAmerican who wished us to pull out of the war and exterminate American\r\nJews would have been a traitor to his own country. These decisions\r\ncannot be compared with the choice of a toothpaste, a deodorant, or a\r\ncigarette.\r\n\r\nAdvertising succeeds in peacetime precisely because it does not matter;\r\nthe choice which the consumer makes is of slight importance to himself,\r\neven though it is of importance to the seller of the product. A\r\nDromedary cigarette and an Old Coin cigarette are both cigarettes; the\r\nman is going to smoke one anyhow. It does not matter so much to him. If\r\nDromedaries are associated in his mind with mere tobacco, while Old\r\nCoins call up unaccountable but persistent memories of actresses' legs,\r\nhe may buy Old Coins. The physical implements of propaganda were at hand\r\nin 1941-1942, but we Americans had become so accustomed to their use for\r\ntrivial purposes that much of our wartime propaganda was conducted in\r\nterms of salesmanship.\r\n\r\nIn a sense, however, salesmanship does serve the military purpose of\r\naccustoming the audience to appeals both visual and auditory. The\r\nconsequence is that competing, outside propaganda can reach the domestic\r\nAmerican audience only in competition with the local advertising. It is\r\ndifficult for foreign competition to hold attention amid an almost\r\nlimitless number of professionally competent commercial appeals. A\r\nCommunist or Fascist party cannot get public attention in the United\r\nStates by the simple expedient of a \"mass meeting\" of three hundred\r\npersons, or by the use of a few dozen posters in a metropolitan area.\r\nBefore the political propagandist can get the public attention, he must\r\nedge his media past the soap operas, the soft drink advertisements, the\r\nbathing beauties advertising Pennsylvania crude or bright-leaf tobacco.\r\nThe consequence is that outside propaganda either fails to get much\r\npublic attention, or else camouflages itself to resemble and to exploit\r\nexisting media. Clamorous salesmanship deadens the American citizen to\r\nhis own government's propaganda, and may to a certain extent lower his\r\ncivic alertness; but at the same time, salesmanship has built up a\r\npsychological Great Wall which excludes foreign or queer appeals and\r\nwhich renders the United States almost impervious to sudden ideological\r\npenetration from overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Psychological Warfare and Public Relations.= Psychological warfare and\r\npublic relations are different in the direction in which they apply.\r\nPsychological warfare is designed to reach the enemy. Public relations\r\nis designed primarily to reach the home audience. Both reach neutrals,\r\nsometimes confusingly much. In some nations, the two functions were\r\ncombined in a single instrumentality, as in the Japanese _Joho Kyoku_\r\n(see page 184, below). The American army and navy traditions of public\r\nrelations are based on the ideas that the news should be as complete as\r\nmilitary security may permit, that it should be delivered speedily and\r\ninterestingly, that it should enhance the confidence of the people in\r\ntheir armed services, and that its tenor (no less than its contents)\r\nshould not aid the enemy morale. These ideas are justified in terms of\r\nsound newspaper practice, but they can lead to a weak psychological\r\nwarfare position when we must deal with an inventive and enterprising\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to separate public relations from psychological\r\nwarfare when they use the same media. During World War II, the Office of\r\nWar Information prepared elaborate water-tight plans for processing war\r\nnews to different audiences; at their most unfortunate, such plans\r\nseemed to assume that the enemy would listen only to the OWI stations,\r\nand that the American public releases issued from Army and Navy would go\r\nforth to the world without being noted by the enemy. If a radio in New\r\nYork or San Francisco presented a psychological warfare presentation of\r\na stated battle or engagement, while the theater or fleet public\r\nrelations officer presented a very different view, the enemy press and\r\nradio were free to choose the weaker of the two, or to quote the two\r\nAmerican sources against each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Psychological Warfare and Morale Services.= All modern armies, in\r\naddition to public relations, also employ morale services\r\nfacilities--officers or employees whose function it is to supply troops\r\nwith entertainment, educational materials, political indoctrination, and\r\nother attention-getting materials. Morale services are the prime overt\r\ndefense against enemy psychological warfare, and by a program of keeping\r\nthe attention of the troops, can prevent the enemy from establishing\r\neffective communication. During World War II, the Armed Forces Radio\r\nService of the United States established global radio service for\r\nAmericans, and incidentally turned out material of top importance to\r\nUnited States propaganda. Naturally, enemy and allied peoples would pay\r\nmore serious heed to communications from Americans _to_ Americans than\r\nthey would to materials which they knew had been concocted for\r\nthemselves. The American morale services in the last war indignantly\r\nrejected the notion that they were a major propaganda facility,\r\nrightfully insisting that their audience counted on getting plain\r\ninformation, plain news, and plain education without ulterior propaganda\r\ncontent. The fact that in a theater of war _all communication has\r\npropaganda effect_ was not always taken into account, and only on one\r\nor two critical occasions was there coordination of stress and timing.\r\n\r\nIt must be said, however, that propaganda by any other name is just as\r\nsweet, and that the conviction of the propagandist that he is not a\r\npropagandist can be a real asset. Morale services provided the American\r\nforces with news, entertainment, and educational facilities. Most of the\r\ntime these morale facilities had huge parasitical audiences--the global\r\nkibitzers who listened to our broadcasts, read our magazines, bought our\r\npaper-bound books on the black markets. (It was a happy day for Lienta\r\nUniversity at Kunming, Yünnan, when the American Information and\r\nEducation set-up began shipping in current literature. The long-isolated\r\nChinese college students found themselves deluged with good American\r\nbooks.)\r\n\r\nThe morale services lost the opportunity to ram home to their\r\nG.I.-plus-foreign audience some of the more effective points of American\r\npsychological warfare, but they gained _as propagandists_ by not\r\nadmitting, even to themselves, that they _were_ propagandists. Since the\r\nUnited States has no serious inward psychological cleavages, the general\r\nmorale services function coordinated automatically with the\r\npsychological warfare function simply because both were produced by\r\ndisciplined, patriotic Americans.\r\n\r\nIn the experience of the German and Soviet armies, morale services were\r\nparts of a coordinated propaganda machine which included psychological\r\nwarfare, public relations, general news, and public education. In the\r\nJapanese armies, morale services were directed most particularly to\r\nphysical and sentimental comforts (edible treats, picture postcards,\r\ngood luck items) which bore little immediate relation to news, and less\r\nto formal propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Related Civilian Activities.= In a free nation, the big media of\r\ncommunication will remain uncoordinated even in time of war. The press,\r\nthe stage, motion-pictures, part of the radio, book publishing and so on\r\nwill continue. Psychological warfare has in such private facilities a\r\nconstantly refreshed source of new material for news or for features. By\r\na sparing but well considered liaison with censorship, psychological\r\nwarfare can effect negative control of non-governmental materials, and\r\ncan prevent the most overt forms of enemy propaganda from circulating on\r\nthe home front.\r\n\r\nNews becomes propaganda when the person issuing it has some purpose in\r\ndoing so. Even if the reporters, editors, writers involved do not have\r\npropaganda aims, the original source of the news (the person giving the\r\ninterview; the friends of the correspondents, etc.) may give the news\r\nto the press with definite purposes in mind. It is not unknown for\r\ngovernment officials to shift their rivalries from the conference room\r\nto the press, and to provide on-the-record or off-the-record materials\r\nwhich are in effect _ad hoc_ propaganda campaigns. A psychological\r\nwarfare campaign must be planned on the assumption that these civilian\r\nfacilities will remain in being, and that they will be uncoordinated;\r\nthe plan must allow in advance for interference, sometimes of a very\r\ndamaging kind, which comes from private operations in the same field.\r\nThe combat officers can get civilian cars off the road when moving\r\narmored forces into battle but the psychological warfare officer has the\r\ndifficult task of threading his way through civilian radio and other\r\ncommunication traffic over which he has no control.\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare is also closely related to diplomacy. It is an\r\nindispensable ingredient of strategic deception. In the medical field,\r\npsychological warfare can profit by the experiences of the medical\r\ncorps. Whenever a given condition arises among troops on one side,\r\ncomparable troops on the other are apt to be facing the same condition;\r\nif the Americans are bitten by insects, the same insects will bite the\r\nenemy, and enemy soldiers can be told how much better the American\r\nfacilities are for insect repulsion. Finally, psychological warfare is\r\nintimately connected with the processing of prisoners of war and with\r\nthe protection of one's own captured personnel.\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare is a field to itself, although it touches on many\r\nsciences and overlaps with all the other functions of war. It is\r\ngenerally divisible into three topics: the general scheme of\r\npsychological warfare, the detection and analysis of foreign\r\npsychological warfare operations, and the tactical or immediate conduct\r\nof psychological warfare. Sections of this book deal with each of these\r\nin turn. In each case it must be remembered, however, that psychological\r\nwarfare is not a closed operation which can be conducted in private, but\r\nthat--to be effective--psychological warfare output must be a part of\r\nthe everyday living and fighting of the audiences to which it is\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\n\r\nDefinition of Psychological Warfare\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare seeks to win military gains without military\r\nforce. In some periods of history the use of psychological warfare has\r\nbeen considered unsportsmanlike.[12] It is natural for the skilled\r\nsoldier to rely on weapons rather than on words, and after World War I\r\nthere was a considerable reluctance to look further into that\r\nweapon--propaganda--which Ludendorff himself considered to be the most\r\nformidable achievement of the Allies. Nevertheless, World War II brought\r\na large number of American officers, both Army and Navy, into the\r\npsychological warfare field: some of the best work was done without\r\ncivilian aid or sponsorship. (Capt. J. A. Burden on Guadalcanal wrote\r\nhis own leaflets, prepared his own public-address scripts, and did his\r\nown distributing from a borrowed Marine plane, skimming the tree tops\r\nuntil the Japanese shot him down into the surf. He may have heard of OWI\r\nat the time, but the civilians at OWI had not heard of him.)\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare has become familiar. The problems of psychological\r\nwarfare for the future are problems of _how better_ to apply it, not of\r\nwhether to apply it. Accordingly, it is to be defined more for the\r\npurpose of making it convenient and operable than for the purpose of\r\nfinding out what it is. The whole world found out by demonstration,\r\nduring World Wars I and II.\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare is not defined as such in the dictionary.[13]\r\nDefinition is open game. There are three ways in which \"psychological\r\nwarfare\" and \"military propaganda\" can be defined:\r\n\r\n  first, by deciding what we are talking about in a given situation,\r\n  book, conversation, or study course;\r\n\r\n  second, by determining the responsibilities and authority involved in\r\n  a given task;\r\n\r\n  or third, by stating the results which are believed to be\r\n  accomplishable by the designated means.\r\n\r\nPlainly, the staff officer needs a different definition from the one\r\nused by the combat officer; the political leader would use a broader\r\ndefinition than the one required by soldiers; the fanatic would have his\r\nown definition or--more probably--two of them; one (such as \"promoting\r\ndemocracy\" or \"awakening the masses\") for his own propaganda and\r\nanother (such as \"spreading lies,\" \"corrupting the press,\" or \"giving\r\nopiates to the people\") for antagonistic propaganda.[14] Definition is\r\nnot something which can be done once and forever for any military term,\r\nsince military operations change and since military definitions are\r\ncritically important for establishing a chain of command.\r\n\r\nThe first method of definition is satisfactory for research purposes; it\r\nmay help break a politico-military situation down into understandable\r\ncomponents. The second method--the organizational--is usable when there\r\nexists organization with which to demonstrate the definition, such as,\r\n\"Propaganda is what OWI and OSS perform.\" The third method, the\r\noperational or historical, is useful in evaluating situations after the\r\ntime for action has passed; thus, one may say, \"This is what the Germans\r\ndid when they thought they were conducting propaganda.\"\r\n\r\nSince the first lesson of all propaganda is _reasoned disbelief_, it\r\nwould be sad and absurd for anyone to believe propaganda about\r\npropaganda. The \"propaganda boys\" in every army and government are\r\nexperts at building up favorable cases, and they would be unusual men\r\nindeed if they failed to work up a fine account of their own\r\nperformance. Propaganda cannot be given fair measurement by the claims\r\nmade for it. It requires judicious proportioning to the military\r\noperations of which it is (in wartime) normally a part.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Broad and Narrow Definitions.= The term _propaganda_ springs from the\r\nname of that department of the Vatican which had the duty of propagating\r\nthe faith. A multitude of definitions is available. Among Americans,\r\nWalter Lippmann, Harold Lasswell and Leonard W. Doob have done some of\r\nthe most valuable critical, analytical, and historical writing, but a\r\nhost of other scholars have also made contributions, some of them works\r\nof very real importance.[15] For the purposes of explaining what this\r\nbook is about, propaganda may be defined as follows: _Propaganda\r\nconsists of the planned use of any form of communication designed to\r\naffect the minds, emotions, and action of a given group for a specific\r\npurpose._\r\n\r\nThis may be called the broad definition, since it would include an\r\nappeal to buy Antident toothpaste, to believe in the theological\r\nprinciple of complete immersion,[16] to buy flowers for Uncles on\r\nUncles' Day, to slap the Japs, to fight fascism at home, or to smell\r\nnice under the arms. All of this is propaganda, by the broad definition.\r\nSince War and Navy Department usage never put the Corps of Chaplains,\r\nthe PX system, the safety campaigns, or the anti-VD announcements under\r\nthe rubric of propaganda, it might be desirable to narrow down the\r\ndefinition to exclude those forms of propaganda designed to effect\r\nprivate or nonpolitical purposes, and make the definition read:\r\n\r\n  _Propaganda consists of the planned use of any form of public or\r\n  mass-produced communication designed to affect the minds and emotions\r\n  of a given group for a specific public purpose, whether military,\r\n  economic, or political._\r\n\r\nThis may be termed the everyday definition of propaganda, as it is used\r\nin most of the civilian college textbooks.[17] For military purposes,\r\nhowever, it is necessary to trim down the definition in one more\r\ndirection, applying it strictly against the enemy and making it read:\r\n\r\n  _Military propaganda consists of the planned use of any form of\r\n  communication designed to affect the minds and emotions of a given\r\n  enemy, neutral or friendly foreign group for a specific strategic or\r\n  tactical purpose._\r\n\r\nNote that if the communication is not _planned_ it cannot be called\r\npropaganda. If a lieutenant stuck his head out of a tank turret and\r\nyelled at some Japs in a cave, \"Come on out of there, you qwertyuiop\r\nasdfgs, or we'll zxcvb you all to hjkl, you etc.'s!,\" the communication\r\nmay or may not work, but--in the technical sense--it is not propaganda\r\nbecause the lieutenant did not employ that form of communication planned\r\nand designed to affect the minds or emotions of the Japanese in the\r\ncave. Had the lieutenant given the matter thought and had he said, in\r\nthe Japanese language, \"Enemy persons forthwith commanded to cease\r\nresistance, otherwise American Army regrets inescapable consequences\r\nattendant upon operation of flamethrower,\" the remark would have been\r\ncloser to propaganda.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, propaganda must have a known purpose. This element must be\r\nincluded in the definition; a great deal of communication, both in\r\nwartime and in peacetime, arises because of the pleasure which it gives\r\nto the utterer, and not because of the result it is supposed to effect\r\nin the hearers. Sending the Japanese cartoons of themselves, mocking the\r\nGerman language, calling Italians by familiar but inelegant names--such\r\ncommunications cropped up during the war. The senders got a lot of fun\r\nout of the message but the purpose was unintelligently considered. The\r\nactual effect of the messages was to annoy the enemy, stiffening his\r\nwill-to-resist. (Screams of rage had a place in primitive war; in modern\r\nmilitary propaganda they are too expensive a luxury to be tolerated.\r\nPlanned annoyance of the enemy does, of course, have its role--a minor,\r\nrare and special one.)\r\n\r\n\"Psychological warfare\" is simple enough to understand if it is simply\r\nregarded as application of propaganda to the purposes of war, as in the\r\nfollowing definition:\r\n\r\n  _Psychological warfare comprises the use of propaganda against an\r\n  enemy, together with such other operational measures of a military,\r\n  economic, or political nature as may be required to supplement\r\n  propaganda._\r\n\r\nIn this sense, \"psychological warfare\" is a known operation which was\r\ncarried on very successfully during World War II under the authority of\r\nthe Combined and Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is in this sense that some\r\nkind of a \"Psychological Warfare Unit\" was developed in every major\r\ntheater of war, and that the American military assimilated the doctrines\r\nof \"psychological warfare.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, this is only one of several ways of using the term,\r\n\"psychological warfare.\" There is, in particular, one other sense, in\r\nwhich the term became unpleasantly familiar, during the German conquest\r\nof Europe, the sense of _warfare psychologically waged_. In the American\r\nuse of the term, psychological warfare was the supplementing of normal\r\nmilitary operations by the use of mass communications; in the Nazi sense\r\nof the term, it was the calculation and execution of both political and\r\nmilitary strategy on studied psychological grounds. For the American\r\nuses, it was modification of traditional warfare by the effective,\r\ngenerous use of a new weapon; for the Germans it involved a\r\ntransformation of the process of war itself. This is an important enough\r\ndistinction to warrant separate consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Warfare Psychologically Waged.= Various labels were devised to name\r\nHitler's queer, terrifying strategy for the period 1936-1941. One\r\nwriter, Edmond Taylor, called it \"_the strategy of terror_\" in a book by\r\nthat name (Boston, 1940), and also \"the war of nerves.\" Another,\r\nLadislas Farago, a political journalist who started out as an authority\r\non the Axis fifth column in the Near East and ended up in American naval\r\npsychological warfare planning, put forth a book called _German\r\nPsychological Warfare: A Critical, Annotated and Comprehensive Survey\r\nand Bibliography_ (New York, 1941), which digested hundreds of German\r\nworks on topics pertaining to psychology and war, much of this material\r\nconcerned personnel practices, psychosomatic medicine, and other\r\nnon-propaganda aspects of psychology, but the book as a whole was an\r\nimpressive demonstration of how much the Germans had done to make their\r\nwar scientific. Other articles and books on the Nazi \"inventions\"\r\nfollowed in rapid succession.\r\n\r\nAfter the excitement had died down, it was found that the novelty of the\r\nGerman war effort lay in two special fields:\r\n\r\n  first, the perfect or perfect-seeming synchronizing of political,\r\n  propaganda, subversive, and military efforts;\r\n\r\n  second, the use of the findings of modern psychology for the\r\n  attainment of military goals.\r\n\r\nThe Germans set the pace, in the prewar and early war period and United\r\nNations psychological warfare tried to keep up, even though the two\r\nefforts were different in scope and character.\r\n\r\nIn conquering Europe, the German staff apparently used opinion analysis.\r\nMuch of this analysis has turned out to have been superb guesswork; at\r\nthe time, it looked as though the Nazis might have found some scientific\r\nformula for determining just when a nation would cave in. In the conduct\r\nof war, the Germans waged a rapid war--which was industrially,\r\npsychologically and militarily sound, as long as it worked. Their\r\n\"diplomacy of dramatic intimidation\" used the war threat to its full\r\nvalue, with the result that the Czechoslovaks surrendered the\r\nSudetenland without a shot and then submitted themselves to tyranny half\r\na year later; the Germans wrung every pfennigs worth of advantage out of\r\nthreatening to start war, and when they did start war, they deliberately\r\ntried to make it look as horrible as it was. The psychologists had\r\napparently taught the German political and military intelligence people\r\nhow to get workable opinion forecasts; German analysis of anti-Nazi\r\ncounterpropaganda was excellent. Add all this to strategy and field\r\noperations which were incontestably brilliant: the effect was not that\r\nof mere war, but of a new kind of war--the psychological war.\r\n\r\nThe formula for the psychological war is not to be found in the books of\r\nthe psychologists but in the writings of the constitutional lawyers. The\r\ntotality of war is a result of dictatorship within government; total\r\ncoordination results from total authority. The \"secret weapon\" of the\r\nGermans lay in the power which the Germans had openly given Hitler, and\r\nin his use of that power in a shrewd, ruthless, effective way. The\r\nFührer led the experts, not the experts the Führer. If the Germans\r\nsurprised the world by the cold calculation of their timing, it was not\r\nbecause they had psychological braintrusters inventing a new warfare,\r\nbut because they had a grim political freak commanding the total\r\nresources of the Reich. Even in wartime, no American President has ever\r\nexercised the authority which Hitler used in time of peace; American\r\nCabinet members, military and naval figures, press commentators and all\r\nsorts of people are free to kibitz, to offer their own opinions, to\r\nbring policy into the light of day. That is as it should be. The same\r\nfactors which made \"psychological warfare\" possible in the beginning of\r\nthe war were the ones which led to Germany's futile and consummate ruin\r\nin 1944-45: excessive authority, an uninformed public, centralized\r\npropaganda, and secret political planning.\r\n\r\nThat kind of \"psychological warfare\"--war tuned to the needs of\r\nfanatically sought lusts for power, war coordinated down to the nth\r\ndegree, waged in the light of enemy opinion and aiming at the political\r\nand moral weaknesses of the enemy--is not possible within the framework\r\nof a democracy. Even from within Imperial Japan, Pearl Harbor had to be\r\nwaged secretly as a _purely_ naval operation; those Japanese who would\r\nhave told the Board of Field Marshals and Fleet Admirals that an\r\nunannounced attack was the best way to unify all American factions\r\n_against_ Japan were obviously not brought into the planning of the\r\nPearl Harbor raid. The Japanese still had too much of their old\r\nparliamentary spirit left over, as Ambassador Grew's reports show; the\r\nmilitary had to outsmart the home public, along with the foreigners. In\r\nthe Western dictatorships, the home public is watched by élite troops,\r\nsecret police, party cells, and is made the subject of psychological\r\nwarfare along with the victim nations. Hitler could turn the war spirit\r\non and off; the Japanese did not dare do so to any effective extent.\r\n\"Psychological warfare\" was too dictatorial a measure even for prewar\r\nJapan; it is therefore permanently out of reach of the authorities of\r\nthe United States. After war starts, we are capable of surprising the\r\nenemy with such things as incendiary raids, long-range bombers, and\r\nnuclear fission; but we cannot startle with the start of war. The United\r\nStates is not now capable and--under the spirit of the Constitution, can\r\nnever be capable--of surprising an enemy by the _timing of aggression_.\r\nIf the same were true of all other nations, peace would seem much nearer\r\nthan it does.\r\n\r\nGerman psychological warfare, in the broad sense of warfare\r\npsychologically waged, depended more on political background than on\r\npsychological techniques. Disunity among the prospective victims, the\r\ncomplaisance of powers not immediately affected, demonstration of new\r\nweapons through frightful applications, use of a dread-of-war to harness\r\npacifism to appeasement, the lucky geographic position of Germany at the\r\nhub of European communications--such factors made the German war of\r\nnerves seem new. Such psychological warfare is not apt to be successful\r\nelsewhere except for aggressions by dictatorships against democracies;\r\nwhere the democracies are irritable, tough, and alert, it will not work\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nThe psychological warfare which remains as a practical factor in war is\r\ntherefore not the Hitlerian war of nerves, but the Anglo-American\r\napplication of propaganda means to pre-decided strategy. Let him who\r\nwill advocate American use of the war of nerves! He will not get far\r\nwith commentators publishing his TOP SECRET schedule of timing, with\r\nlegislators very properly catechizing him on international morality,\r\nwith members of his own organization publishing their memoirs or airing\r\ntheir squabbles right in the middle of the operation. He would end up by\r\namusing the enemy whom he started out to scare. Psychological warfare\r\nhas its place in our military and political system, but its place is a\r\nmodest one and its methods are limited by our usages, morality, and law.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Propaganda: Definitions.= Propaganda has been defined (above, page 39).\r\nIt remains to distinguish some of the other technical and professional\r\nterms which apply in this field. In operational terms, propaganda can be\r\ndistinguished by the consideration of five elements:[18]\r\n\r\n  1. Source (including Media)\r\n  2. Time\r\n  3. Audience\r\n  4. Subject\r\n  5. Mission\r\n\r\nThese factors are given in approximate order of importance to the\r\nanalyst, and provide a good working breakdown for propaganda analysis\r\nwhen expert staffs are not available. The five factors can be remembered\r\nby memorizing the initial letters in order: S-T-A-S-M. The last factor,\r\n\"Mission,\" covers the presumed effect which the enemy seeks by\r\ndissemination of the item.\r\n\r\nWithout going into the technique of field propaganda analysis (described\r\nbelow, page 115), it is useful to apply these analysis factors to the\r\ndefinition of some subordinate types of military propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Source_ is the most important. If the source is open and acknowledged,\r\nthe government issuing it is putting the propaganda on the record before\r\nthe world, and must therefore issue the propaganda with a certain amount\r\nof dignity and with an eye to the future. If the source is faked, then\r\nit is important for the government or army to make sure that the faking\r\nis a good job, and that the propaganda cannot readily be traced back.\r\nTwo very different techniques are employed. Open sources require\r\nresponsible public officials, preferably men with international\r\nreputations, who will get the best effect from use of the name and\r\nfacilities of the government. Use of an open source usually (but not\r\nalways) implies belief of the disseminator in the veracity of his\r\nmaterials. Fabricated sources require persons adept at illicit\r\nimaginativeness, impromptu forgery, and general devilment, combined with\r\na strong sense of discipline and security. The United States was so\r\nchary of mixing the two kinds of propaganda during World War II that it\r\noperated them in different categories, giving rise to the three\r\nfollowing types:\r\n\r\n_White propaganda_ is issued from an acknowledged source, usually a\r\ngovernment or an agency of a government, including military commands at\r\nvarious levels. This type of propaganda is associated with overt\r\npsychological operations.\r\n\r\n_Grey propaganda_ does not clearly identify any source.\r\n\r\n_Black propaganda_ purports to emanate from a source other than the true\r\none. This type of propaganda is associated with covert psychological\r\nwarfare operations.\r\n\r\nWhite propaganda is shown in figure 4, which does everything possible to\r\nmake the message the official message of the British and American\r\ngovernments. The border is done up in handsome banknote fashion; the\r\ngreat seals of the nations are handsomely displayed; the signatures of\r\nthe commanding generals are shown as further attestation of the\r\nopenness and good faith of the issuer of the propaganda.\r\n\r\nFigure 38 was also prepared by British-American authority; it too had\r\nthe job of making Germans surrender. But in this case, nothing was done\r\nto make the British-American source evident; indeed, every effort was\r\nmade to hide the source, so that the German who read it would think that\r\nit came from within his own territory. The two different kinds of\r\npropaganda were both of them needed; each supplemented the other but\r\nthey had to be kept apart as far as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the field of radio, the difference between Covert and Overt was even\r\nmore plain. During World War II, the ether over Europe was filled with\r\nappeals from radio stations both public and covert in character. The\r\nBritish spoke to the Germans over B.B.C., making no effort to conceal\r\nthe fact that they were British. But they also spoke to the Germans over\r\nclandestine stations, which pretended to be free-lancing Nazis, German\r\narmy stations, or freedom group operations. The Germans, comparably,\r\nbeamed official German news to the United States in English; but they\r\nalso pretended to be Americans broadcasting from an isolationist radio\r\nin the American mid-west. In some cases, the belligerent powers used the\r\nidentical radio transmission facilities for overt and covert propaganda.\r\nRadio Saipan, under the Americans, was most of the time the relay for\r\nthe acknowledged San Francisco programs; intermittently OSS borrowed it,\r\nand it then became a \"Japanese\" station. (Under such conditions, black\r\nradio cannot remain black very long.)\r\n\r\nIn terms of the timing, propaganda can be subdivided into two further\r\ncategories, strategic and tactical. Strategic propaganda is conducted\r\nwith no immediate effect in view. Its purpose is to wear down the enemy\r\nby psychological changes that may extend over months. Figure 19, warning\r\nthe Germans of the remote future, is an example of this in leaflet form.\r\nTactical propaganda is operated to accomplish an immediate short-range\r\npurpose, and normally does not cover a long time-span. Only in a few\r\ncases, such as leaflets for a besieged enemy unit, is tactical\r\npropaganda run for a purpose that encompasses a long delay between the\r\noperation and the expected result. These two forms may be defined as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _Strategic propaganda_ is directed at enemy forces, enemy peoples, and\r\n  enemy-occupied areas in their entirety, and--in coordination with\r\n  strategic planning--is designed to effectuate results planned and\r\n  sought over a period of weeks, months, or years.\r\n\r\n  _Tactical propaganda_ is directed at specific audiences, usually\r\n  named, and is prepared and executed in support of localized combat\r\n  operations.\r\n\r\nAnother set of distinctions can be set up, depending on the relationship\r\nof the propaganda operation to the simultaneous hostile propaganda\r\noperations, namely offensive or defensive propaganda. Before the advent\r\nof World War II, this distinction appeared to be significant but\r\nexperience on almost all fronts indicated that it meant little when\r\napplied to day-in day-out necessities of actual practice. Propaganda is\r\nso intimately keyed to the news and opinion situation that it does not\r\nusually bear elaborate pre-operational analysis. Elaborate planning very\r\noften ends up in the locked files; the distinction of offensive and\r\ndefensive means little in routine work. However, for the sake of the\r\nrecord, the distinction can be listed:\r\n\r\n  _Defensive propaganda_ is designed to maintain an accepted and\r\n  operating form of social or other public action. (Soviet propaganda\r\n  for the Five Year Plans is a conspicuous instance.)\r\n\r\n  _Offensive propaganda_ is designed to interrupt social action not\r\n  desired by the propagandist, or to predispose to social action which\r\n  he desires, either through _revolutionary_ means (within the same\r\n  society) or _international_, either diplomatic or belligerent (between\r\n  different societies).\r\n\r\nAnother set of distinctions arises from the purpose which the propaganda\r\nofficer or group may have in mind for the people whom he addresses.\r\nThese distinctions, like offensive-defensive, are theoretical rather\r\nthan practical, and did not often appear in the actual operations,\r\nalthough all the more hush-hush plans made elaborate references to them:\r\n\r\n  _Conversionary propaganda_ is designed to change the emotional or\r\n  practical allegiance of individuals from one group to another.\r\n\r\n  _Divisive propaganda_ is designed to split apart the component\r\n  subgroups of the enemy and thereby reduce the effectiveness of the\r\n  enemy group considered as a single unit. (An instance is provided by\r\n  the Allied effort to make German Catholics think first as Catholics,\r\n  then as Germans.)\r\n\r\n  _Consolidation propaganda_ is directed toward civil populations in\r\n  areas occupied by a military force and is designed to insure\r\n  compliance with the commands or policies promulgated by the commander\r\n  of the occupying force.\r\n\r\n  _Counterpropaganda_ is designed to refute a specific point or theme of\r\n  enemy propaganda. (Japanese charges of American atrocities usually\r\n  followed American charges of Japanese atrocities.)\r\n\r\nExcept for those terms that are firmly rooted in the literature of\r\npropaganda, most of the distinctions can be forgotten; the basic\r\ndistinctions are those determined by the task involved, and not by the\r\npropaganda content.\r\n\r\nWorld War II brought up a very sore issue between military and civilians\r\nwith respect to propaganda in areas with unsettled governments--such as\r\nDarlanist North Africa, Communist China, all of Siam. (See, also,\r\ndiscussion of World War II, below, page 77 ff.) In these areas every\r\nmilitary act involved the definition of the political relations of the\r\nUnited States Government to the governments locally enjoying authority.\r\nWere we at war with them, or not? And so on. In these cases, politics\r\nitself became a vital foundation to propaganda, especially when the\r\nlocal authorities were themselves active in the propaganda field. The\r\nAmerican theater and unit commanders had to decide what kinds of\r\npolitical promises they could or could not make. In this job, they had a\r\nmore difficult task than did the British, who possessed in the Political\r\nWarfare Executive a pooling facility which coordinated foreign policy\r\nwith propaganda.[19] Could we promise freedom from France to the\r\nAlgerians? Or immunity to the Siamese who re-doublecrossed in the matter\r\nof allegiance and got ready to subvert the Japanese? Or the Yenan people\r\nwho wanted us to highjack the Generalissimo as a price of their support?\r\nOr the Indonesians who might oppose the Japanese and already opposed the\r\nDutch? Such questions transcended propaganda. Their decision made\r\npropaganda, or unmade it; but the deciding power was outside the\r\nauthority of the propaganda people.\r\n\r\nPolitical warfare is therefore, in administrative terms, a higher-level\r\nactivity than propaganda, and may be defined as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Political warfare consists of the framing of national policy in such\r\n  a way as to assist propaganda or military operations, whether with\r\n  respect to the direct political relations of governments with one\r\n  another or in relation to groups of people possessing a political\r\n  character._\r\n\r\nSuch policy-framing does not normally fall within the authority of the\r\nArmy or Navy, though these may be consulted and called upon to effect\r\nappropriate military action. An outstanding instance of the use of\r\npolitical warfare was President Roosevelt's impromptu enunciation of the\r\ntheme \"Unconditional Surrender\" at Casablanca. The theme affected not\r\nonly our propaganda, but the types of surrenders which American generals\r\ncould accept from Germans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4\r\n\r\nThe Limitations of Psychological Warfare\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare cannot be known simply in terms of what it is; it\r\nmust also be understood in relation to the limits which are imposed on\r\nit. The limitations can be described under four headings:\r\n\r\n  political limitations;\r\n  security limitations;\r\n  limitations arising from media;\r\n  limitations of personnel.\r\n\r\nLike all limitations, these are handicaps only to the person who lacks\r\nthe courage and resourcefulness to turn them into assets. Propaganda is\r\ndependent on politics, even for such front-line requirements as\r\n\"definition of the enemy,\" yet intelligent exploitation of political\r\ngoals yields valuable results. Security is an asset to any army; its\r\nprice is rarely too high a price to pay for protection, but a selective\r\nand flexible censorship can lead to positive advantages. _Media_--that\r\nis, the actual instrumentalities by which propaganda is conveyed--are\r\nthe ordnance of psychological warfare. They limit the performable job\r\nbut they also make it possible in the first place. And as in any\r\nmilitary operation, success depends most of all on proper use of\r\npersonnel.\r\n\r\nEach of these merits discussion. The experience drawn upon has, in\r\nalmost all instances, been that of World War II. As in most other\r\nfields, common sense runs a close second to experience as a guide in new\r\nmethods of struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Political Limitations of Psychological Warfare.= Politics has great\r\ninfluence on the content of psychological warfare. The relationship\r\nbetween two warring states is not one of complete severance; on the\r\ncontrary, in wartime the relationship becomes abnormal, acute,\r\nsensitive. Each belligerent takes a strong interest in the other, in its\r\naffairs and weaknesses. During World War II the American armed services,\r\ngovernment, and people learned more about the Japanese than they would\r\nhave in twenty years of peacetime education. Japanese names made news.\r\nThe purposes and weaknesses of the Japanese became the objects of hatred\r\nand--along with the hatred--intense scrutiny.\r\n\r\nEach warring nation tries to turn the known enemy interest in itself\r\ninto favorable channels. The propagandists of each country try to give\r\nthe enemy the news which the enemy wants, while so arranging that news\r\nas to create a drop in enemy morale, to develop uncertainty in enemy\r\npolicies, to set enemy cliques into action against each other. The\r\npropagandist sometimes becomes very agitated because he recognizes as a\r\ntechnician propaganda opportunities which national policy prohibits his\r\nusing. The propagandist who is so intent on his target that he forgets\r\nhis broader responsibilities can often spoil the entire operation.\r\n\r\nGerman broadcasters who emphasized the anti-capitalist character of\r\nNational Socialism in the programs beamed to Eastern Europe found that\r\nB.B.C. picked up the most tactless statements and repeated them to\r\nWestern Europe, where the Germans posed as anti-Bolshevik champions of\r\nprivate property. American attacks on the Germans for associating with\r\nJapanese monkey-men were passed along by the Japanese to the Chinese,\r\nwho did not like the slur either. The most notorious example of\r\nbackfiring propaganda was of course the famous \"Rum, Romanism, and\r\nRebellion\" phrase, which may have made James G. Blaine lose to Grover\r\nCleveland in the national election of 1884; the phrase was used by a\r\nRepublican clergyman in New York, referring to the Democrats, and\r\nimplied that the Wets (anti-prohibitionists), Catholics, and Southerners\r\nwere important components in the Democratic Party. (This may have been\r\ntrue, but it pleased none of them to have the matter pointed out with\r\nsuch epithets; the phrase succeeded in its short-range purpose, that of\r\nrousing Republicans, but failed by rousing the enemy even more and\r\noffending neutral-minded persons as well.)\r\n\r\nThe balance between home-front politics and field psychological warfare\r\nis difficult to maintain. The closer the psychological warfare officer\r\nis to the enemy, the more apt he is to think of the mission in terms of\r\ngetting the enemy to come on over. Why quibble about a few phrases if\r\nthe words will save lives, matériel, and time? Unfortunately the phrase\r\nthat is successful against the enemy on the battle front may prove to be\r\nan irritant to the home public, with the sure consequence that the enemy\r\nwill pick it up and send it back to do harm. Similarly, home-front\r\npropaganda can get out to do the theaters of operation harm: \"Do your\r\nutmost--save lard!\" sounds silly to men in combat areas.\r\n\r\nThis can be illustrated by the propaganda problem of the Japanese\r\nEmperor. It would have helped domestic American politics to call the\r\nJapanese Emperor a monkey, a swine, a lunatic, a witch-doctor or\r\ncomparable names; some people did so. But if the American government had\r\ndone so at home for the purpose of rousing its own public, the Japanese\r\nhome public would have been roused even more with the net result that\r\nthe Americans would have lost by such attacks. If the Russians\r\npromised--as in another instance they are reported to have done--good\r\nfood and warm clothes to the Germans on the winter fronts, the Nazis\r\npassed that promise along to the Russian civilians, who would not think\r\nwell of Stalin's letting Fascist invaders be plump and snug while they\r\nthemselves nearly starved. For the enemy audience, it is good to\r\nportray excellent care of enemy personnel; for the home audience, it is\r\npoor. For the home audience it is sometimes good to present the enemy as\r\nruthless lunatics, beasts in human form, cruel degenerates, and so on;\r\nbut the same claims, falling into enemy hands, can be used to the\r\ndisadvantage of the originator by being relayed to the enemy home\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, sound psychological warfare must take account of the fact\r\nthat its ultimate aim is the successful ending of the war. For the end\r\nto be successful it must occur--the fighting must stop and the nations\r\nmust enter into altered but renewedly peaceful relations. Propaganda\r\nthat promises the enemy too much will alienate both allies and home\r\npublic. But propaganda that promises bloody vengeance hurts possible\r\npeace movements in the enemy camp. None of the great powers in World War\r\nII went so far as to promise specific frontiers for the postwar period.\r\nThey kept their promises vague, knowing that a definite promise would\r\nplease somebody but alienate everyone else; furthermore, by not\r\npromising, the expectations of the hopeful parties can be kept at a\r\nhigher pitch. If the French do not _know_ that they will get the Saar\r\nthey will fight so much the harder; but if they are promised the Saar\r\nthey come in a very short while to regard the promise as a settled\r\nmatter, and proceed to ask for something else. Meanwhile, other possible\r\nclaimants to the Saar either have a sense of grievance or lose interest\r\nin the matter. For this reason, postwar political uncertainty can be a\r\npropaganda asset.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt, in his conduct of the political world role of the\r\nUnited States, promised Manchuria to the Chinese, Korea \"in due course\"\r\nto the Koreans, and the integrity of the French Colonial Empire to the\r\nFrench; outside of that he avoided specific promises. In another\r\ninstance (to put a complicated matter baldly), the British promised\r\nPalestine to both the Arabs and to the Jews in World War I, and\r\nconsequently got themselves into a political mess which, thirty years\r\nlater, was still a mess.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Definition of the Enemy.= Another significant connection between\r\npolitics and propaganda is found in definition of _the nature of the\r\nenemy_. For combat operations, it is easy (most of the time) to tell who\r\nthe enemy is; he is the man with the other uniform, the foreign\r\nlanguage, the funny color or physique. For psychological operations, it\r\nis not that easy. The sound psychological warfare operator will try to\r\nget enemy troops to believing that the enemy is not themselves but\r\nsomebody else--the King, the Führer, the élite troops, the capitalists.\r\nHe creates a situation in which he can say, \"We're not fighting _you_.\"\r\n(This should not be said too soon after extensive use of bombs or\r\nmortars.) \"We are fighting the So-and-so's who are misleading you.\" Some\r\nof the handsomest propaganda of World War II was produced by the Soviet\r\nexperts along this line. Before the War was over, Soviet propaganda\r\ncreated a whole gallery of heel-clicking reactionary German generals _on\r\nthe Russian side_, and made out that the unprofessional guttersnipe\r\nHitler was ruining the wonderful German Army in amateurish campaigns.\r\nJoseph Stalin's ringing words, \"The German State and the German _Volk_\r\nremain!\" gave the Russians a propaganda loophole by which they implied\r\nthat Germany was not the enemy--no, not Germany! just the Nazis. This\r\nwas superb psychological warfare, since the Russians had already built\r\nup the propaganda thesis that the common people (workers and peasants)\r\nwere automatically--by virtue of their class loyalty--on the side of the\r\nworkers' country, Russia. That left very few Germans on the other side.\r\n\r\nFor psychological warfare purposes, it is useful to define the enemy as:\r\n\r\n  (1) the ruler;\r\n  (2) or the ruling group;\r\n  (3) or unspecified manipulators;\r\n  (4) or any definite minority.\r\n\r\nIt is thoroughly unsound to define the enemy too widely. On the other\r\nhand, too narrow a definition will leave the enemy the opening for a\r\npeace offensive if the ruler dies, or if the ruling group changes part\r\nof its composition. It was fear of a peace move by the German generals,\r\nplus the desire to maintain the precarious anti-German unity of the\r\noccupied countries, which led the United States and Britain to adopt the\r\npolicy of defining the German Reich rather than Naziism as the enemy. In\r\nthe instance of Japan, we defined the enemy as the militarists and\r\n\"Fascists,\" with the capitalists a poor second, and left the Emperor and\r\npeople with whom to make peace.\r\n\r\nIf the psychological warfare campaign is operated for a definite\r\npolitical purpose, it is possible for politics to be an aid rather than\r\na limitation. The operator can describe his own political system in its\r\nmost radiant light. He can say complimentary things about the enemy\r\nleaders or groups who might come over (though he should avoid giving\r\nthem the kiss of death which the Nazis gave certain prominent American\r\nisolationists, by praising them too much). He can promise his own brand\r\nof Utopia.\r\n\r\nIf the politics are defensive, vague, well-meaning but essentially\r\nnon-committed, psychological warfare has to avoid making blunders. In\r\nWorld War II we could not say that we were against one-party states,\r\nbecause our largest ally (Russia) was a one-party state. We could not\r\nattack the ruin of free enterprise by the Japanese and German\r\ngovernments since socialism existed on the Allied side too. We could not\r\nbring up the racial issue, because our own national composition rendered\r\nus vulnerable to racial politics at home. There was a huge catalog of\r\n_Don'ts_ (usually not written down but left to individual judgment) in\r\nevery propaganda office. Whenever we violated them, we paid the price in\r\nadverse opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Promises.= Finally, psychological warfare must avoid promises that may\r\nnot be kept. The Americans during World War II never promised much as a\r\ngovernment, but individual American agents promised all sorts of things\r\nwhich could not be delivered. We promised the Dutch their homeland and\r\nempire by implication; we promised the Indonesians self-government, also\r\nby implication; and we promised everybody, including the Japanese,\r\naccess to Indonesian raw materials. It is highly probable that\r\nindividual Americans, off-the-record, stated that they \"expected,\"\r\n\"hoped,\" or \"thought\" that their government would fulfill each of these\r\npromises. The three are not compatible, especially the first and second.\r\nThe New York banker, James Warburg, has written a book, _Unwritten\r\nTreaty_, pointing out that the United States promised just about\r\neverything to everybody during the war (he was in OWI and he ought to\r\nknow), and that it is going to take a generous, wise, and intelligent\r\nforeign policy to fulfill--even in part--the promises which we made. The\r\npromises of the loser are forgotten; he can write them off and start\r\ninternational policies with a clean slate. But the promises of the\r\nvictor remain, and have to be carried out or else repudiated.\r\n\r\nThe psychological warfare officer should not make promises to persons in\r\noccupied territory, to friendly guerrillas, to underground movements, or\r\nto enemy troops when those promises are not backed up by word-for-word\r\nquotations from the head of his government or someone of Cabinet rank.\r\nThe promises may not conform with promises which other psychological\r\nwarfare officers are making to other groups. (In China, some American\r\nofficers told the Chinese Communists that the Chinese Communists were\r\nwonderful people, and would be sure to get American material aid and\r\npolitical sympathy against Chiang Kai-shek. At the same time, other\r\nAmerican officers told the Chinese government people that the United\r\nStates did not propose to short-circuit recognition of the Chinese\r\ngovernment, or to interfere in internal Chinese affairs. The two sets of\r\nChinese heard about the American promises and, for a while, could not\r\ndecide whether Americans were fools or liars. Much the same sort of\r\nthing happened in our dealings with French, Serbs, and Poles.) It is a\r\npoor piece of work for a combat officer to promise elections,\r\nliberties, labor rights, or even food to people in his path, unless the\r\nrear echelon people will be able to deliver the goods when they come up.\r\nAnd it is an irresponsible radio or leaflet man who makes promises\r\nwithout finding out whether his government is in a position, in relation\r\nto the political situation, to back up the promises one way or other.\r\nHis nation itself will be called a liar if he slips up.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Security Limitations.= Another serious set of limitations arises from\r\nsecurity problems.\r\n\r\nThe very conduct of psychological warfare encroaches upon perfectionist\r\nplans for security. Security is designed to keep useful information from\r\nreaching the enemy; propaganda operations are designed to get\r\ninformation to him. Security is designed to keep the enemy from knowing\r\ntrue figures; but propaganda must have a lot of good, current, _true_\r\ninformation if it is to be believed. Security demands that military and\r\nnaval news be withheld until the extent of the enemy's knowledge is\r\nknown; propaganda is designed to tell the enemy the news faster than his\r\nown sources tell him, thus discrediting enemy news. Security demands\r\nthat dubious persons, intimately associated with the enemy, be kept away\r\nfrom communications facilities; propaganda officers have to keep an eye\r\nopen for people who speak the enemy language well, who can address the\r\nenemy sympathetically and get his attention, who have a keen\r\nappreciation of the enemy culture.\r\n\r\nOften, it is plain, psychological warfare and security officers get in\r\neach other's way. This conflict was lessened by American censorship\r\norganization during World War II. The United States Office of Censorship\r\nunder Byron Price achieved a distinguished record of smooth, reasonable,\r\nand modest operation. It took an adult view of the intelligence of the\r\nAmerican public, and permitted bad news to reach the public except when\r\nthe Services or the White House intervened. Much of the story of this\r\noffice is told in Theodore Koop's exciting book, _Weapon of\r\nSilence_,[20] which makes it plain that censorship sought to avoid\r\ndeveloping negative psychological warfare campaigns on its own\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\nThe usual wartime security procedures apply with special force to\r\npsychological warfare operations. Civilian employees who are qualified\r\nas political experts, as writers, or as propaganda analysts are often\r\nwell-educated and artistic. They are apt to value classified information\r\nhighly for the pleasure which they can derive by violating\r\nsecurity--that is, by showing \"people they can trust\" how much they are\r\n\"in on\" certain operations. The temptation to show off is almost\r\nirresistible. (The vice is not unknown even in military echelons.) An\r\natmosphere of excessive security easily degenerates into melodrama,\r\nbringing out in many individuals a silly zest for displaying to others\r\nhow much TOP SECRET information they possess. Where military and\r\ncivilian personnel work together, this human weakness is stimulated by\r\nrivalry. Even among the Germans in World War II, propaganda groups were\r\neasily infected by an atmosphere of gossip and intrigue.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Security Procedures.= Security procedures for psychological warfare\r\ninvolve the usual common-sense precautions which apply to all\r\noperations, and which may be summarized in the following rules:\r\n\r\n  (1) Classification should be kept at an absolute minimum. No\r\n  information should be classified unless there are genuinely strong\r\n  reasons for supposing that it would benefit the enemy. Classification\r\n  and declassification should be the responsibility of designated\r\n  officers trained for the task. (In World War II, many American\r\n  civilians classified information recklessly, with the result that all\r\n  classification became a subject of disrespect. The author once found a\r\n  highly classified inter-Allied plan in the hands of an elderly woman\r\n  stenographer in Washington, who safeguarded the information by leaving\r\n  the papers in a desk drawer which had no pull. The drawer had to be\r\n  opened with a nail file and that fact comprised the \"security.\")\r\n\r\n  (2) Security should apply, generally speaking, to units as a whole,\r\n  taking working units up to the limit of face-to-face working\r\n  acquaintance as a base. It is unsound procedure to give certain\r\n  individuals a higher level of information than others, since the\r\n  privileged individuals will be tempted to display their inside\r\n  knowledge, and the underprivileged individuals will be goaded by\r\n  unwholesome, resentful, and acute curiosity. Either the entire unit\r\n  should be given the information, or denied it.\r\n\r\n  (3) Security should not be applied for editorial purposes. Censorship\r\n  is a separate function. Improper security procedures, vesting\r\n  arbitrary powers in stated officers, may tempt the security officer to\r\n  express his personal literary, artistic, or political preferences\r\n  under the guise of maintaining security. The inevitable consequence is\r\n  the breakdown of both security and of procedure. Censorship should be\r\n  applied in conformity with national or theater censorship policies.\r\n  Review and estimate of radio or leaflet output is another function.\r\n\r\n  (4) Security for printed materials is easy enough to maintain. The\r\n  leaflets can be sent to the G-2 to check, or wherever else security\r\n  functions may be vested. Radio security is another problem.\r\n  Experience in World War II indicates that spot news cannot wait for\r\n  routine security, but must be processed through. Two types of control,\r\n  supplementing one another, are desirable:\r\n\r\n  _Security liaison_ on a 24-hour basis should be available to the radio\r\n  operatives for the rapid processing of military news. The security\r\n  duty officer should be indoctrinated with an attitude of\r\n  cooperativeness, based on an understanding of the value of propaganda,\r\n  and should conceive it as his mission to explain the needs of radio\r\n  propaganda to his superiors, rather than taking the attitude of being\r\n  superior to the radio operatives. There is a sound psychological\r\n  reason for this. The presence of a sympathetic security officer will\r\n  increase cooperativeness on the part of the propaganda broadcaster. An\r\n  unsympathetic one will merely maintain the official dignity of his\r\n  office and position. High morale on the part of script writers is more\r\n  important than high morale of security officers.\r\n\r\n  _Security supervision_ can be exercised by monitoring facilities: that\r\n  is, the security officers can equip themselves with a good radio\r\n  receiver and listen to the broadcasts without ever meeting the\r\n  broadcasters. A critical frame of mind on the part of such security\r\n  personnel is desirable. Unlike liaison officers, they need not be\r\n  cooperative. Since their criticism applies after the operation, they\r\n  can afford to apply rigorous standards. (During most of 1942 and 1943,\r\n  no one in Washington had any idea of what actually _went out_ from San\r\n  Francisco. The civilians who broadcast to Japan received elaborate\r\n  orders to do this and to do that, but the Washington policy-makers did\r\n  not know what was going on the air. On one occasion, the civilian\r\n  propaganda broadcasters told the Army in Washington that the\r\n  information was too highly classified to be released or circulated.\r\n  The result was that Army and Navy found out what OWI was doing by\r\n  receiving reports from listeners in the Pacific.)\r\n\r\nSecurity liaison can check propaganda output in the process of\r\ntransmission; security supervision can check the output after it goes on\r\nthe air, and can transmit through channels recommendations for punitive\r\nor corrective action. The final military connection should exist (for an\r\nall-military psychological warfare group) in the person of a responsible\r\ncommanding or executive officer. For a civilian group functioning under\r\nmilitary control the military connection should lie in the hands of an\r\nofficer capable of watching a great deal and of saying little. Attempts\r\nby security to act as propagandists have been found to be as disastrous\r\nas the efforts of operators to get along without security.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Media Limitations.= Psychological warfare should not broadcast into\r\nareas in which radio sets are unknown. Psychological warfare should not\r\ndrop books to illiterates. These rules seem obvious but they have often\r\nbeen violated. Psychological warfare should not assume that an extensive\r\nnews or morale campaign is going to achieve the desired results unless\r\nthere is trustworthy intelligence to the effect that propaganda is\r\ngetting through.\r\n\r\nIt is ridiculous to broadcast to the masses of a country when the masses\r\nare known not to have radio facilities. This was done in the\r\nanti-Japanese broadcasts of OWI, at least in the early part of the war,\r\nin which mass-audience soap operas and popular music were sent to Japan\r\non the short-wave--this despite reports that short-wave sets were almost\r\nunknown outside governmental or plutocratic circles. What was known was\r\nthat the Japanese government itself had listening facilities, and that\r\nthe content of American broadcasts was relayed through Japanese military\r\nand governmental groups. The propaganda (to fit the medium, radio)\r\nshould have been designed _to affect the persons actually reached_, and\r\nnot an audience known to be out of reach. The mere fact that enemy\r\ncounterpropaganda mentions one's own material is nothing more than a\r\nprofessional exchange of compliments. Goading the enemy radio into a\r\nreply may be fun, but unless non-propagandists are known to be\r\nlistening, the fun is expensive and unprofitable.\r\n\r\n(It is really fun, though. The author suggested in the spring of 1942\r\nthat the San Francisco radio carry an item to the effect that \"American\r\nart lovers\" hoped the Japanese would move their priceless books and\r\npaintings away from the great cities. This was preparation for eventual\r\nnagging on the topic, \"the air raids will get you if you don't watch\r\nout!\" The radio civilians in San Francisco put the item on the air.\r\nNothing was heard from the Japanese on the subject. Four days later,\r\nRadio Luxembourg [then under Nazi control, of course] broadcast in\r\nGerman to Europe that a spokesman for the \"beastly American Air\r\nMinistry\" had told the Japanese that the Americans planned to destroy\r\ncultural monuments. The Nazi commentator added that this was\r\ncharacteristic of the actions of uncivilized Americans. New York picked\r\nup the German broadcast. The author enjoyed seeing his item go all the\r\nway around the world, but in retrospect he wonders whether he did any\r\ngood other than to please himself. He did do the actual harm of giving\r\nthe Nazis another point to distort.)\r\n\r\n_Media_ consist simply of the facilities possessed. These are, most\r\ncommonly:\r\n\r\n  (1) Standard-wave radio;\r\n  (2) Short-wave radio;\r\n  (3) Loudspeakers;\r\n  (4) Leaflets;\r\n  (5) Pamphlets;\r\n  (6) Books;\r\n  (7) Novelties.\r\n\r\nThe limitations consist simply of applying the right medium at the right\r\ntime. Radio broadcasts need be made only when receiving sets are known\r\nto exist. Written material should be dropped only to areas in which at\r\nleast some people can read. (The OWI in China, at the request cf CBI\r\nForward Echelon Headquarters, made up the leaflet showing pictures only.\r\nThis was designed for the aboriginal hillmen between China and Tibet--to\r\ntell them to rescue downed American pilots. Broadcasting to these people\r\nwould have been as profitable as spitting in the ocean. None of them\r\ncould read, much less understand radio.) The probable number of\r\nlisteners or readers should be calculated conservatively, taking enemy\r\npolicing, amount of enemy interest, customs of the people, tension among\r\nenemy troops or civilians and other appropriate factors into account.\r\n\r\nOccasionally propaganda media exceed the expected limitations. The\r\nAmericans and British dropped leaflets on Berlin. The leaflets had\r\nlittle key numbers in the corners, showing to which series they\r\nbelonged, and could thus be arranged in series. The Germans prohibited\r\ncivilians from picking up the leaflets. The Nazi authorities followed up\r\nthe prohibition by sending the _Hitlerjugend_ and _Hitlermädel_ out to\r\npick up the leaflets and turn them in for destruction. The boys and\r\ngirls did their job with gusto. Vast quantities were turned in for\r\ndestruction. What the Nazis discovered--too late, too late--was that the\r\nschoolchildren had begun collecting the leaflets, using the key numbers\r\nto make up perfect sets. Some numbers were rarer than others, so that\r\nthe Hitlerite children swapped Allied leaflets all over Berlin, trying\r\nto make up attractive albums. Mother and Father--who did not dare pick\r\nthe leaflets up off the street for fear the Gestapo might be\r\nwatching--found a convenient file, reasonably complete, in the room of\r\nlittle Fritzl or Ermintrude! The most hopeful British or American\r\nplanner could not have counted on such a happy result.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Maximum Performance of Personnel.= Another limitation, to be found in\r\nany psychological warfare operation, is that imposed by the types of\r\npersonnel available. It would be a rash commander who assumed that he\r\nhad air support because he saw airplanes--without knowing whether air\r\ncrews were available. A microphone does not make a propagandist.\r\nPersonnel using the speaking voice have to be good speakers; merely\r\nknowing the language is not enough. Writing personnel must be up to the\r\nlevel of professional writers. On the other hand, the available\r\npersonnel must not be driven above its limits of performance: often an\r\nattempt to do a too-professional job will defeat the propaganda. (When\r\nthe Japanese pretended to be perfectly American, and used the corny\r\nobsolete slang of the 1920's, they aroused more contempt than they would\r\nhave done had they confined themselves to rather bookish, plain\r\nEnglish.)\r\n\r\nThe psychological warfare operation must be gauged to the personnel\r\nfacilities no less than to the material facilities. (In China, the\r\nauthor sat in with an expert on medieval and modern Japanese art, who\r\nwas writing leaflets which were to be dropped on the Japanese garrisons\r\nof the Yangtze cities. The expert wrote pure, dignified Japanese, but\r\nthe Chinese-Japanese language experts brought up the point, \"Would the\r\nJapanese common soldier understand this kind of talk?\" For a while, we\r\nhad no plain-spoken Japanese at hand, and we had to send our Japanese\r\nleaflets from Chungking up to Yenan, where the Japanese Communists read\r\nthe leaflets and wrote back long detailed criticisms.)\r\n\r\nWhenever the politico-military situation permits, it is sound procedure\r\nto check output with live enemies, either interned civilians or captured\r\nmilitary personnel. A shrewd interrogator can soon find out whether the\r\ncomments from the enemy jury are honest or not.\r\n\r\nIntelligent psychological warfare procedures have often turned\r\nliabilities into assets. Absence of a good orchestra has compelled\r\npropagandists to make up current music schedules by recording enemy\r\nmusical programs, re-broadcasting them with new spoken commentary.\r\nFailure to obtain native speakers (such as genuine home-grown Japanese,\r\nor Chinese with the properly slurred Wu dialect) has led to the use of\r\nsubstitutes that proved better than the original. There is no point in\r\ntrying to establish _rapport_ with the enemy unless you talk his\r\nlanguage with effortless perfection on the one end of the scale--or else\r\nadmit that you really are a foreigner, on the other end of the scale. It\r\nis easier to build up the image of a trustworthy enemy than it is to\r\ncreate trust in a traitor. Frequently the attempt to talk the enemy's\r\nown language is less successful than a frank acceptance of handicaps.\r\n\r\nIn actual practice this means that either--\r\n\r\n  (a) the speaker should be authentically perfect in use of the enemy\r\n  language, whether spoken or written as script; _or_\r\n\r\n  (b) the speaker should make no effort to conceal his foreign accent.\r\n\r\nIn British broadcasts to Germany, for example, it was found to be\r\ndesirable for the radio announcers to have British accents in their\r\nGerman, rather than the Viennese or Jewish lilt which many of them did\r\nhave. A Nazified audience was so infected with anti-Semitism that no\r\nJewish speaker could carry much weight, no matter how cogent his\r\narguments nor how eloquent his appeals. The British tone in the voices\r\nof other speakers actually helped carry conviction. The Germans were\r\nprepared to listen to a genuine Britisher, and might have been\r\ndisappointed if he had spoken letter-perfect _German_.[21]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, with the perfect speaker of the enemy language there is\r\nalways the question, \"What is that guy doing over there?\" A traitor is\r\nless appealing than an open enemy spokesman; a traitor has to be\r\nsensationally good in order to get across at all. Lord Haw Haw was one\r\nof a kind, but he seems to have had genuine theatrical talent along with\r\na crazy zeal which persuaded his hearers that though he was on the wrong\r\nside, he did believe his own line. The perfect speaker, whether enemy\r\nrenegade or friendly linguist, has an inglorious role at the beginning\r\nof war, when enemy morale is high and the enemy population has not had\r\ntime to think over the problem of changing sides. Only toward the end of\r\nthe war, or in any morale downgrade, the man who says, \"Come on over!\r\nSee? I'm here. It's fine,\" has a chance of being believed.\r\n\r\nThe propaganda administrator must use his personnel thoughtfully. It is\r\na waste of talent and--in advance field units, of life as well--to\r\nimpose tasks which operatives cannot handle. An American _nisei_ from\r\nCalifornia should not be asked to talk slangy _Edokko_ Japanese; a\r\nsoldier detailed to psychological warfare, because of some special\r\nlinguistic qualification, should not be considered a great journalist,\r\nradio commentator, or actor just because he speaks the right language.\r\nIf he is given a microphone, and the feeling of having an audience (one\r\nthat cannot write adverse fan mail), it will be easy for the average man\r\nto overestimate the effect of his own talk. The intelligent officer\r\ntries to see his staff as the enemy would see them; he keeps their\r\nlimitations in mind. If they speak the enemy language perfectly, they\r\nfall under suspicion as traitors; if they speak it poorly, they may\r\nsound like bunglers or jackasses. Nevertheless, propaganda must come\r\nfrom men and through words written by men, and the flavor must be\r\nfitted to the situation. Advance planning should therefore consider the\r\navailable personnel as an actual factor in estimating the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Counterpropaganda.= Counterpropaganda could be listed as a limitation,\r\nas the enemy combat strength is sized up in physical warfare. This,\r\nhowever, is one of the points at which psychological warfare differs\r\nfrom other forms. If the propaganda message is worth putting across, it\r\nneed not be geared to what the enemy is saying. Enemy propaganda should,\r\nin well conducted operations, be taken into account only when it becomes\r\nan asset. That is, the enemy need only be heeded when he tells a\r\nwhopping lie, or comes forth with a piece of hyprocrisy so offensive to\r\nhis own people that it needs little improvement to be adapted for\r\ncounterpropaganda. Most enemy themes are beyond reach, especially those\r\nof inter-ideological warfare. The Nazis and Russians made the best\r\npropaganda against each other when they got down to the basic\r\nnecessities of life, not when they were trying to weave finespun\r\ntheories about each other's way of thinking or of life. Refutation is a\r\njoy; it is delightful to talk back. But the best propaganda is only\r\nincidentally counterpropaganda. It uses enemy blunders and counteracts\r\nenemy success by building up unrelated successes of its own.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that propaganda analysis is not needed. Somewhere in\r\nevery psychological warfare unit there must be an intelligence group\r\nservicing the operation. If, for example, the enemy has announced that\r\nthe candy your aviators are dropping is poisoned (and has proved it by\r\ndropping some of \"your\" candy, made by his black-operations boys and\r\nactually poisoned), there is no point in calling him a liar; you may not\r\nknow for some time whether poisoned candy has been dropped or not. If\r\nthe enemy commander has shown his troops photographs of prisoners whom\r\nyour side has taken and \"murdered\" (according to his well staged\r\nphotos), it is not a good idea to ask people to surrender without\r\nsending along equally convincing pictures of well cared for prisoners.\r\nIf the enemy alleges that you and your allies are rioting in the streets\r\nor stealing each other's womenfolk, or that one of you is doing all the\r\nfighting while the other sits around in safe staging areas, it may be a\r\ngood idea to send along some leaflets showing inter-allied cooperation\r\non your side, or to run a few radio shows on the subject.\r\n\r\nThis consists merely of reckoning the enemy propaganda as part of the\r\npsychological warfare situation, and of using the enemy as part of the\r\nbackground to your own advantage. The moment you start letting him take\r\nthe initiative, your propaganda wags along behind his. Tell _his_ people\r\nsomething _he_ can't deny. Let him sit up nights worrying about how he\r\nwill counteract _you_. Make him drive his security officers crazy trying\r\nto release figures that will please your G-2 in order to reassure his\r\nhome audience. Really good propaganda does not worry about\r\ncounterpropaganda. It never assumes that the enemy propagandist is a\r\ngentleman: he is by definition a liar. Your listeners and you are the\r\nonly gentlemen left on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5\r\n\r\nPsychological Warfare in World War I\r\n\r\n\r\nWorld War I saw psychological warfare transformed from an incidental to\r\na major military instrument, and later it was even called the weapon\r\nwhich won the war. The story spread, since the Germans liked to imagine\r\nthat they had been talked out of winning, and since ex-propagandists\r\namong the Allies enjoyed thinking that their own cleverness had been\r\ndecisive when even the tremendous violence of trench warfare had\r\nproduced nothing more than a stalemate. If psychological warfare is\r\nconsidered in the broad sense, it seems plain that it was among the\r\ndecisive weapons of 1914-1918. The political decency of the Allies, the\r\nappeal of President Wilson's Fourteen Points, the patent obsolescence of\r\nthe Kaiser and what he stood for, the resurgence of Polish, Baltic,\r\nFinnish, Czechoslovak and South Slav nationalisms--all these played a\r\nreal part in making Germany surrender in 1918. More real than the role\r\nof guns, men, ships, planes, tanks? This cannot be answered: it is like\r\nasking of a long-distance runner whether his heart, lungs, legs, or head\r\ncontributed most to his success. Since war is waged by and against all\r\nparts of the human personality--physical condition, skills,\r\nintelligence, emotions, and so on--it is impossible to distinguish\r\nbetween the performance of one kind of weapon and the other in the\r\nattainment of a goal itself complex--governmental surrender. Only a\r\nweapon which left no enemy survivors could claim for itself undisputed\r\nprimacy in victory.\r\n\r\nPropaganda came to prominence in war because the nations involved had\r\nmade mass-communications part of their civilian lives. The appearance of\r\nhuge newspapers, systematic advertising, calculated political publicity,\r\nand opinion manipulation in other forms made it inevitable that skills\r\nwhich developed in civilian life should be transferred to the military.\r\nIn general, _the psychological warfare efforts of each belligerent were\r\nthe direct equivalent of his peacetime nonpolitical propaganda\r\nfacilities_. (By way of exception, the peculiar genius of the Bolshevik\r\nleaders stimulated a propaganda effort disproportionate to the\r\nfacilities, either of personnel or matériel, to be found in pre-1914\r\nRussia.)\r\n\r\nNations rarely change their basic character in time of war. When war\r\nstarts it is usually too late to re-educate generations already grown\r\nup, teach them wholly new skills, or develop administrative or\r\noperational procedures unknown in peacetime life. Sometimes, by great\r\neffort, a nation can transform a small available cadre into large, new\r\nand effective units on the political, military, economic or social\r\nfronts. Even then, the character of the war effort will be colored and\r\ninfluenced by the experience of the men undertaking it. The British had,\r\nin 1914, one of the world's finest news systems, a highly sophisticated\r\npress, and extensive experience in international communication for\r\ntechnical and commercial purposes, notably the undersea cable system,\r\nand they turned these to war use with considerable smoothness. The\r\nGermans had a far more regimented press and a more limited network of\r\ncommercial and technical connections. The British, furthermore, had a\r\ndiplomatic and consular service of superb quality; comparable German\r\nservices included a much higher proportion of bunglers and enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning the British had the lead. They nailed German\r\npropaganda as propaganda, while circulating their own as news, cultural\r\nrelations, or literature. The Germans who boasted that they were a\r\n\"cultured\" people had their naïveté rewarded when the British let the\r\nGerman word _Kultur_ become a synonym for boorish pedantic arrogance.\r\nThe Germans had the awful habit of putting many of their own\r\nunattractive emotions into words, and the even more ruinous habit of\r\nthen printing the words. In many instances, the British simply let the\r\nGermans think up braggadocio or vengeful phrases, then circulated the\r\nGerman phrases to the world. The English language was permanently\r\nenriched by some of these: _strafe_ comes from the German plea that God\r\n\"strafe\" (punish) England. The actual \"Hymn of Hate\" was originally a\r\nsong made up by Germans for Germans. The word \"Hun\" was applied to the\r\nGerman Army by Kaiser Wilhelm himself, and so on. Furthermore, the\r\nGermans created in their press and information services a condition of\r\nbureaucratic snafu which has rarely been excelled in any war. National\r\ncharacter certainly worked out its automatic vengeances in World War I.\r\n\r\nThe American psychological warfare effort of 1917-1919 also drew heavily\r\non familiar skills: the American press, second only to that of the\r\nBritish at the time; the church, Y.M.C.A., and Chautauqua groups; and\r\nthe wealth of private clubs which flourish under our liberal system of\r\nlaws and usages. Other nationalities made efforts similarly in keeping\r\nwith their peacetime facilities. The Japanese were adroit, but even at\r\nthat time confused by the mix-up of trying to be a \"civilized\" power but\r\nsimultaneously expansionist. The French showed high professional skill\r\nin adapting their military and diplomatic personnel to propaganda tasks.\r\nFrance's position as battleground ensured her of the rage of her own\r\npeople and the sympathy of neutrals, giving propaganda from Paris a\r\nhearing. The Chinese, though undergoing the downfall of the Yüan\r\nShih-k'ai dictatorship and lapsing into chaos, maintained an impeccable\r\ndiplomatic front and played a weak hand for everything it was worth;\r\nthey had their private quasi-war with the Japanese in 1915. That they\r\ndid so while putting the blame for Allied disunity squarely on the\r\nJapanese where it belonged is to their credit.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the propaganda war, as of the material war, fell on its\r\nprime contestants, Britain, Germany, and the United States. The private\r\nand revolutionary groups which emerged as the revolutionary governments\r\nplayed a vigorous part because they had few other functions to distract\r\ntheir attention. The Republic of Czechoslovakia got its start in\r\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1918, and fought psychological warfare from\r\nthe instant it took form; not till later did it assume the weightier and\r\nmore expensive responsibilities of ruling and warring.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The British Effort.= In World War I, the British made most of the\r\nmistakes and learned most of the lessons which the Americans were to\r\nmake and to learn in World War II. The British Foreign Office formed a\r\nWar Propaganda Bureau in 1914, but a great deal of the effort was done\r\nby private facilities (patriotic associations) or by lower political and\r\nmilitary echelons of the government and armed forces--and without\r\ncoordination. Things became so confused that at the mid-point of the\r\nwar, the British organized a Department of Information with Colonel John\r\nBuchan at its head. (Buchan will be remembered by all adventure-lovers\r\nas author of _The Thirty-nine Steps_, _The Courts of the Morning_, and\r\nother first-class thrillers; he was also made a peer under the style,\r\nLord Tweedsmuir, and became a popular Governor-General of Canada.)\r\nBuchan did not always get along with the committee which floated above\r\nhim, telling him how to run his business.\r\n\r\nThe British, like the Germans, had immense organizational difficulties.\r\nThe British ended up by inventing a distinction of roles. Thus they\r\nfinished World War I with two separate propaganda agencies. The Ministry\r\nof Information, under Lord Beaverbrook, with Colonel Buchan as Director\r\nof Intelligence, carried on civilian psychological warfare outside\r\nBritain; the National War Aims Committee carried on civilian\r\npsychological warfare within Britain. Military psychological warfare was\r\ncarried on by military and civilian agencies, both. The British required\r\nfive years of honest effort, bitter wrangling, and positive political\r\ninvention in order to devise a psychological warfare system sufficient\r\nto meet the needs of a great power at war. They did not let their\r\nadministrative difficulties prevent their conduct of correct, poised and\r\nhighly moral propaganda, nor impede their use of plentiful funds and\r\nhigh ingenuity in getting their propaganda across.[22]\r\n\r\nThe British set the pace in coordinating political warfare with\r\nnews-propaganda, and in effecting workable liaison between national\r\npolicy-makers and operational and public-relations chiefs of the armed\r\nservices. It is not likely that, even in World War II, the\r\nAmericans--within the looser, younger, bigger framework of our more\r\ncompendious government--achieved as good results in terms of timing.\r\nState-War-Navy-OWI-OSS-Treasury timing of related events or news items\r\nwas obtained through most of World War II in the following manner: the\r\nfederal agency affected did whatever it was going to do anyhow, and\r\nother federal agencies took notice after the event, initiating their\r\nrelated actions, if any were feasible, then and only then. The British\r\nsought to get around this in World War I by correlating their policy\r\ntoward various countries with their policy involving different\r\ndepartments. They were not totally successful but they learned a lot;\r\nthe net product of their propaganda was, for most of its purposes,\r\nsuperb.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The German Failure In Propaganda.= German writers, after World War I,\r\nsometimes attributed the superiority of the British in propaganda to the\r\ninnate fiendishness of Britishers as contrasted with the gullible purity\r\nof Germans. The psychoneurotic non-com who made himself famous to the\r\nworld's cost did not make this mistake. In _Mein Kampf_ Hitler stated\r\ncategorically that the British had understood the professional touch in\r\npropaganda while the Germans had not. Hitler's contempt for the masses\r\nwas shown in his explicit statement of their inattentiveness, their poor\r\nresponse to formal logic, their affirmative reaction to simple one-sided\r\nreiteration. He said: \"[In England] ... propaganda was a weapon of the\r\nfirst class, while with us it was a sop to unemployed politicians....\"\r\nGerman nationalists of whatever stripe found themselves in accord when\r\nthey blamed their military defeat on the enemy's use of propaganda. They\r\nthus succeeded in maintaining the myth, already sedulously inculcated\r\nfor two centuries, that the German army could not be beaten in the\r\nfield. The extremists and crackpots among them went on to develop the\r\n\"stab-in-the-back\" theory that an unbeaten Germany was betrayed from\r\nwithin by Jews, socialists, and democratic people. (The mutually\r\nexclusive alternatives--namely that either Allied propaganda was\r\nfiendishly good, and the Germans merely innocent victims, or else that\r\nAllied propaganda was ineffectual and the anti-war sentiment a purely\r\nGerman development--did not keep the Hitlerites from exploiting both\r\nalibis simultaneously.)\r\n\r\nThe postwar period of the 1920's saw, therefore, the curious spectacle\r\nof the Germans lauding American psychological warfare, and counting it\r\nas a major factor of defeat, while the Americans naturally emphasized\r\nthe fighting record of American troops.\r\n\r\nAs for Kaiserist propaganda, it started out with the twin curses of\r\namateurishness and bureaucracy, each of them crippling but deadly when\r\npaired. German writers and scholars ran wild in 1914 and 1915 in trying\r\nto put the blame on the Allies; amateurish in public relations, they\r\nsucceeded in arousing a tremendous amount of antagonism. They were\r\nhandicapped by the ponderosity of the German Imperial Government, by the\r\nintervention of persons unfamiliar with news or advertising (at that\r\ntime the most obvious sources of civilian propaganda personnel), and by\r\na military stodginess which made German press communiqués infuriating\r\neven to anti-British readers. Overseas propaganda developed through\r\npoorly secured clandestine channels, and was mixed up with espionage and\r\nsabotage personnel. Inescapable \"breaks\" gave all German agents a bad\r\nname. George Sylvester Viereck, who has enjoyed the odd distinction of\r\nbeing our most vocal pro-German sympathizer in both wars with Germany,\r\nlater wrote a naïve but revealing account of his operations under the\r\ntitle _Spreading Germs of Hate_ (Boston, 1930). (No British information\r\nofficer was guilty, even after the war, of a comparable breach of\r\ntaste.) Viereck praises the British for their sang-froid and skill;\r\ncoming from him, the praise is more than deserved.\r\n\r\nMore seriously, German propaganda lacked both organization and moral\r\ndrive. Lieutenant Colonel Nicolai, the Imperial German General Staff\r\nofficer responsible, puts part of the blame on the German press and on\r\nthe press officers of the Army and the Reich: \"In fact, the enemy\r\nremained virtually untouched by any kind of German propaganda. This\r\nreproach falls against the press, it would seem, as well as on the\r\nresponsible officials.... Internationally minded papers themselves\r\nfailed to cooperate. Yet it was precisely these which were circulated\r\nand esteemed abroad. Newspapers with other (pro-militarist) editorial\r\npolicies, failing to get leadership from the Government, could not aim\r\nat any unified effect.... Instead, the goal of the governmental press\r\nleadership remained a thoroughly negative one: to prevent the press from\r\ndoing harm to national policy.\"[23]\r\n\r\nWithout developing his theme into systematic doctrine for psychological\r\nwarfare, the German colonel stated the basic defect of World War I from\r\nthe German point of view. Writing in 1920, he went on to say: \"The enemy\r\nalleges simply to have copied our front-line propaganda when he\r\ninitiated his. In so doing, he is guilty of a deliberate untruth, made\r\nfor the sake of removing the moral blot which is attached to his\r\nvictory....\" Nicolai could not overcome the supposition that propaganda\r\nwas a dirty and unsoldierly device and that it was much more honorable\r\nfor armies to exchange loss of life than to save men on both sides by\r\ntalking the enemy into surrendering, but he went on to the real point at\r\nissue. \"Furthermore, it was not moralistic misgivings which kept us from\r\napplying to the enemy front lines a propaganda campaign as successful as\r\ntheirs, but very sober practical obstacles. There were available to us\r\nnone of the (psychological) points of attack at which propaganda would\r\nhave been effective against the enemy forces, points such as the enemy\r\nfound in our own domestic conditions. What was lacking was political\r\npropaganda as precursor of military.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the Germans failed to learn in World War I, they later learned and\r\napplied in World War II. The German Imperial Government started in 1914\r\nwith a defiant assurance of its own power. Power was not sought among\r\nthe masses so far as Kaiser Wilhelm was concerned; one inherited it from\r\none's ancestors, along with an army, and the masses had better keep\r\ntheir noses out of it. The Hitlerite German government of 1939 began its\r\nworld war only after two decades of shrewd, conscienceless, bitter\r\ndomestic propaganda. Hitlerism had come to power by first wooing and\r\nthen bullying the common man, and the Nazi chiefs, in their strategy of\r\nterror or \"warfare psychologically waged,\" subsequently applied the same\r\ntactics to the international community. Hitler conquered Europe with\r\nthese tactics; he started with flattery, made scenes, and ended with\r\ncold brutality. These were the skills of the urban slum.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Creel Committee.= The fabulous American propaganda, of which the\r\nGermans expressed such dread, was the work of two agencies. The civilian\r\nagency was the Committee on Public Information, universally known as the\r\n\"Creel Committee\" after its chairman, Mr. George Creel. The military\r\nagency was the Propaganda Section (or Psychologic Section), G-2D,\r\nGeneral Headquarters, American Expeditionary Forces, under Captain Heber\r\nBlankenhorn.\r\n\r\nThe Creel Committee had the superlative advantage of possessing a chief\r\nwho enjoyed the confidence of the President and whose participation in\r\nnational policy was on a high enough level to give propaganda\r\ncoordination to other governmental policies on a basis of equality.\r\nCreel himself considered the task to be one of advertising, and he\r\norganized his Committee with extreme looseness, expanding it rapidly.\r\nAlthough his total gross budget for the war was only a fraction of OWI's\r\nbudgets in World War II, he systematized most of the publicity\r\nactivities then available.\r\n\r\nNews services were maintained by means of a news bureau in Washington\r\nthat fed material to the commercial press and processed other material\r\nto publicity missions abroad. Heavy emphasis was placed on the home\r\naudience for Creel's mission covered all phases of propaganda work.\r\nSections were set up for posters, advertising, \"Four Minute Men\"\r\n(volunteer local speakers in all American communities), films, American\r\nminority groups and the foreign-language press, women's organizations,\r\ninformation bureaus, syndicated features, and cartoons. The young but\r\nalready large American motion picture industry was made a channel\r\nwhereby American propaganda movies went to both the United States and\r\noverseas audiences. In one instance Creel got the American producers to\r\nthreaten Swiss exhibitors with a boycott unless they showed American\r\npropaganda film along with the features.\r\n\r\nMissions were sent to France, England, Italy, Switzerland, Holland,\r\nSpain, Scandinavia, Mexico and other Latin American countries, China,\r\nand Russia. It was not considered necessary to send American\r\npropagandists to Japan in World War I. The Japanese were given the\r\nAmerican propaganda file and were asked to use it; they said they would.\r\n\r\nThe Creel Committee was run in simple, almost chaotic fashion. Agencies\r\nproliferated whenever a new idea turned up. The basic concept was that\r\nof domestic American agitation, as practiced commercially through\r\nadvertising and socially through the civic clubs. The war propaganda\r\nleft a rather bad taste in the mouth of many Americans, and the\r\nboisterous joviality of the arousers probably produced negative\r\nattitudes which encouraged pacifism and isolationism in the postwar\r\nyears. The purely technical side of the work was done well, but at the\r\nterrible cost of overshooting national commitments.\r\n\r\nAmerica emerged from the war disappointed at home and discredited\r\nabroad--so far as the heated propaganda of \"making the world safe for\r\ndemocracy\" was concerned. A more modest more calculated national\r\npropaganda effort would have helped forestall those attitudes which, in\r\nturn, made World War II possible. Creel and his fellow-workers did not\r\nremember that beyond every war there lies a peace, in its own way as\r\ngrim and difficult as war. They did not understand that no war is the\r\nlast war, that leeway must be left for propaganda to be effective\r\n_again_. They said that World War I would be the last of all wars;\r\nperhaps they believed it themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n=General Pershing's Headquarters.= The civilians of the Creel committee\r\npatronizingly claimed to have helped the G-2 men at A.E.F. Headquarters\r\nrun psychological warfare. In the official history of Captain\r\nBlankenhorn's group, which centered from the very beginning on leaflet\r\nproduction, there is little reference to outside aid. Radio did not\r\nexist as a means of mass communication, and loudspeakers then surpassed\r\nan ordinary megaphone very little, if at all; hence communication with\r\nthe enemy had to be through print. Leaflets were basic.\r\n\r\nThe Americans at A.E.F. concentrated on morale and surrender leaflets.\r\nThey did work that was superb from the point of view of common-sense\r\npsychology. They used British and French experience in applying\r\ntechniques of leaflet distribution, making inventions and improvements\r\nof their own. Balloons and airplanes were the chief methods for air\r\ndistribution; the plane-borne leaflet bomb was a development of World\r\nWar II. Extensive improvements were made in the procedures of leaflet\r\ndistribution by means of mortars.\r\n\r\nThe morale leaflets used the anti-militarist, pro-democratic sentiments\r\nof the world at that time. The autocracy and inefficiency of the German\r\ngovernment provided an excellent target. Since propaganda against the\r\nupper classes was not yet regarded as a Communist monopoly, considerable\r\nappeal was introduced for the common German soldier against his\r\ngenerals, nobles, officials, and capitalists. German nationalism was\r\nattacked by means of sectional appeals to Lorrainers and Bavarians. The\r\nnews that America was in fact producing vast weapons, that the American\r\narmy was truly in Europe, that the German retreats were really\r\nserious--these were used in morale form (see below, page 212) rather\r\nthan as spot-news leaflets.\r\n\r\nIt was in the primary mission of combat propaganda--the inducement to\r\nsurrender--that the Americans excelled themselves. They produced\r\nlimitless appeals (see Figure 13) promising the Germans first-class\r\nAmerican food when they surrendered. Emphasis was indeed on all\r\nsurrender themes--good food, human care, privileges under international\r\nlaw, patriotic value of remaining alive, opportunity to return to loved\r\nones, and so forth. But the Americans went over these variously, and\r\ncame back to the topic of food. For an army of hungry men who knew that\r\ntheir homeland starved behind them, the enumeration of things to eat had\r\nobsessive value.\r\n\r\nHaughty and incompetent, the German high command tried to counteract\r\nAllied leaflets--particularly the American leaflets--by the use of\r\nappeals to \"disregard propaganda.\" While the German armies plainly\r\nbacked down toward defeat, such German statements preached about the\r\nsituation. They did not put the common soldier's plight in concrete\r\nterms. They did not say, \"You will be unemployed, poor, sick,\r\ndishonored, lonely, if you surrender. Your wife will be beaten by\r\nFrenchmen, your daughters raped by savages, your father and mother\r\nstarved to death by the food prices.\" Such tactics had to wait for a\r\nlater war. In 1918, the German command, senile and fussy, pointed out\r\nthat enemy leaflets were propaganda (nasty! nasty!) and that good German\r\nsoldiers would remember their duty. For men who probably imagined they\r\ncould smell white bread baking, bacon frying, and coffee cooking across\r\nthe lines, such wordage was nonsense. The Germans came on over to\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 13: Surrender Leaflet from the AEF._ Though this\r\nAmerican combat leaflet from World War I copies the original form of the\r\nGerman _Feldpostkarte_ (field postcard, an early precursor of the V-mail\r\nform), it is not black propaganda since neither source nor intent is\r\nconcealed. \"When you are taken prisoner, by the Americans, give this to\r\nthe first officer who checks your identities.\" The prisoner is commanded\r\nto fill in his own battle-order history. By marking out appropriate\r\nitems, he indicates whether he is hurt or not and can explain that he is\r\nwell cared for and fed \"beef, white bread, potatoes, beans, plums,\r\ngenuine bean coffee, milk, butter, tobacco, etc.\"]\r\n\r\nCaptain Blankenhorn's unit, without benefit of psychologists, developed\r\na German morale analysis chart. This was made up before scientific\r\npolling had become a common technique, and was consequently based on a\r\ngroup of selected known factors given arbitrary weight and then averaged\r\ninto a total. It was not, \"number of German prisoners per hundred who\r\nexpress attitudes characterized by doubt\" but \"the U-boat situation,\"\r\n\"unity in Germany,\" and other abstracted generalities which were used as\r\ncontrols. The chart was carefully kept, and sought to follow morale from\r\nits causative factors rather than by a percentage count of attitudes\r\ndiscovered in the newspapers or among prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Bolshevik and Chinese Revolutions.= The dynamic propaganda\r\ndevelopment of this period came about in Russia. The Russian revolution\r\nbegan as reaction to an adverse military situation, disesteemed\r\nleadership, economic hardship, and long overdue reforms. In its first,\r\nor constitutional phase, it had an inevitableness about it; there was\r\nlittle resistance to the revolution, and the popular mood was one of\r\nrelief, joy, easement. However, the majority group of the Russian\r\nSocialists interpreted the Marxist philosophy to mean (putting it\r\nbluntly) that the end is justified by the means. They believed that they\r\nhad developed a system of politico-economic forecasting which, while not\r\nalways certain, was close to certain. And they further believed that no\r\none else, lacking this system of forecasting, could lead the workers and\r\npeasants to their historically inevitable freedom. This philosophy may\r\nsound beside the point, but it is not. Such abstruse doctrines of\r\nHegelianism and Marxism were used by the majority-Socialists (known by\r\ntheir Russian name, _Bolshevik_) to give themselves a sense of\r\nunconditional rightness. From the first phase of the revolution on, the\r\nBolsheviks pitilessly sabotaged all other democratic groups. There was\r\nno point in helping other groups, when Bolsheviks alone had the inner\r\nsecrets of history at their command.\r\n\r\nIn the geniuses Lenin and Trotzky, the Bolshevik movement found its\r\nleadership. Lenin had no use for democracy as it was known in America.\r\nTo him it was a sham, a front for the great capitalist trusts,\r\nwhich--even though the capitalists themselves might not know it--were\r\ndoomed to get bigger on a shrinking market, until international\r\ncapitalist war, bankruptcy, and working-class revolution was the result.\r\nLenin was as sure that this would happen as he was that the sun would\r\nrise the next morning. The only dispute was the matter of timing; a few\r\nBolshevik pessimists thought that the capitalist world might last into\r\nthe 1920's.\r\n\r\nSuch a frame of mind led to a very deadly kind of psychological warfare.\r\nThe Bolsheviks despised their opponents, desiring to \"liquidate\" them\r\n(this meant breaking down a group and preventing its reforming as a\r\ngroup, but came above all to mean mass murder). They were so\r\nantagonistic to the \"capitalist\" world that they hated God, patriotism,\r\nnational history, churches, money, private property, chastity, marriage,\r\nand verse that rhymed, all with equal intensity. Moscow became the Mecca\r\nfor the eccentrics and malcontents of the world and for some years\r\nRussia was in fact looser in morals than any other civilized country.\r\n\r\nHatred for the capitalist world enabled the Bolsheviks to throw Russian\r\nCzarist patriotism into the discard. They delighted in getting Russian\r\ntroops to desert at the front; the Germans delighted in this, too. But\r\nthe Bolsheviks were certain they would have the last laugh because they\r\nknew it was only a matter of weeks or months before the revolution--the\r\n_inevitable_ revolution, forecast by Karl Marx's peculiar\r\neconomics--broke out in Germany as well. The Russian devil-may-care\r\nattitude toward all established forms of society was perfectly\r\ncharacterized by Trotzky's flip but deadly answer to the German military\r\nnegotiators at the Brest-Litovsk negotiations. When the Germans balked\r\nat some point, \"All right,\" said Trotzky, \"no war and--no peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe Germans insisted that if the Bolsheviks did not sign the dictated\r\npeace terms the German army would make more war.\r\n\r\nFine, said Trotzky in effect, he didn't mind. Go ahead and make war. It\r\nwouldn't worry him or his army. They would go somewhere else and would\r\nrefuse to play games with capitalists.\r\n\r\nThis stopped the Germans in their tracks. They did not want to send\r\ntheir troops into a starving country that roared with subversive\r\ndoctrines. They knew that while Trotzky wasted their time quibbling over\r\nnegotiations, his printing presses worked night and day telling the\r\nGerman troops that the war was over, that capitalism was on its way out,\r\nthat the workers' revolution was coming, everywhere, for everybody, with\r\nfood, peace, plenty, atheism and all the other delights of the good\r\nBolshevik life. The Russians finally signed the surrender treaty but in\r\npoint of fact, the German divisions on the Eastern front were\r\ncontaminated by Bolshevism, and when they came back across Germany they\r\nbrought the message of freedom and peace with them. Germany did have an\r\nabortive Communist revolution--partly because of Russian\r\noperations--though it was stopped by an alliance of the moderate\r\nSocialists and the dependable remnants of the army.\r\n\r\nThe Russians went on merrily through a living hell. For five more years\r\nthe Bolshevik leaders held their country together with wretched\r\nindustrial production, poor food, bad weapons. They had amazingly high\r\nmorale among their own select Bolshevik group, and against the common\r\npeople they had two weapons, propaganda and terror. (The terror was\r\nsymptomatic of the first of the modern totalitarian dictatorships; its\r\ndomestic police role is not a part of psychological warfare.)\r\n\r\nThe Bolshevik propaganda was probably the finest propaganda effort ever\r\nknown in history down to that time--down, perhaps, all the way to our\r\nown time. The political limit was beyond reach; anything in the old\r\nworld was fair game. Things the sober Soviet citizen of 1946 would\r\nregard with veneration were open to ridicule in 1919-1922: patriotism,\r\nreligion, national sovereignty, international law, treaties with or\r\nbetween capitalist states. There flowed from Russia a world-wide stream\r\nof propaganda, mostly clandestine, some of it overt. In every nation of\r\nthe world there was, to a greater or less degree, a \"Red scare\"; the\r\npropaganda of the Bolsheviks was regarded as having mystical subversive\r\npowers which no other operation could match. In retrospect it seems\r\nabsurd that anyone could have worried about the Americans of the 1920's\r\nrevolting against their own Constitution; but a lot of people, including\r\nthe Attorney General of the United States, did indeed worry.\r\n\r\nThey had cause for alarm though not for the reasons they supposed. Much\r\nof the magic of Bolshevik propaganda arose from its taking up where\r\nBritish, French and American propaganda left off. The psychological\r\nwarfare of the Allies had made the sad mistake of promising a new, a\r\nbetter world to everyone on earth. When the war ended, and conditions\r\nwent back to normal, many people in the world did not consider\r\n\"normalcy\" the fulfillment of that better world. The Bolshevik\r\npropaganda reaped the harvest which the Allied propagandist had sown and\r\nthen left untended. Expectations, whipped up beyond normal, turned to\r\nBolshevism when the Western democracies abandoned both domestic and\r\nforeign propaganda operations. The strategic advantage of Bolshevik\r\npropaganda was overwhelming. The Allies had gotten the world ready for\r\nit, so that the wild Utopia of the Leninists temporarily made sense to\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that the Bolshevik propaganda of the 1920s was not\r\ngood. It was good, technically, psychologically, politically--but good\r\nin terms of achieving an immediate scare at the cost of long-range\r\nconfidence. The eventual cost to the Soviet Union was terrible. The\r\nSoviet government isolated itself and declared a condition of open\r\npsychological warfare against every other government on earth, including\r\nthe United States. (This so exasperated Presidents Wilson, Harding,\r\nCoolidge, and Hoover that they refused to recognize the Soviet Union.)\r\nThe Bolshevik propaganda was carried by:\r\n\r\n  Russian government channels;\r\n\r\n  Communist \"party\" channels (the Communists not really being a\r\n  political party, anywhere, but using the name \"party\" to designate the\r\n  hierarchy of a dogmatic, ruthless and fanatical political religion);\r\n\r\n  trade unions;\r\n\r\n  individual subversive operators;\r\n\r\n  \"cover organizations\";\r\n\r\n  trade, consular and other official missions;\r\n\r\n  leaflets in the mails;\r\n\r\n  posters, books and other literature;\r\n\r\n  films;\r\n\r\n  radio.\r\n\r\nThe theme throughout was plain: the world revolution is coming, by\r\ninescapable economic laws discovered by our theory. The world\r\nrevolution, which _will_ come, will remove the _owning_ classes from\r\ncontrol of the productive capital, and will put all capital in the hands\r\nof the workers. \"The expropriators will be expropriated.\" Thereupon the\r\neconomic laws we have found in Marx's books will cease their bad\r\ninfluence and will guarantee world peace, world prosperity, happiness,\r\nhuman freedom. This is not an appeal (they said); this is _science_.\r\nThis is _objective_. We _know_. Listen!\r\n\r\nThe Communists harped on these basic themes. They waged political\r\nwarfare along with the psychological. Every attempt of the non-Communist\r\ncountries to discuss the situation was termed \"conspiracies of the\r\nwarmongers.\" The word \"democratic\" was reserved to the Communists or to\r\nnon-Communists who were certain to cause Communism no trouble. The\r\nCommunists invented an entirely new vocabulary, which the Soviet and\r\nother Communist papers still use, with meanings that have the same\r\nemotional value (plus-value, or, \"that's _good_!\") as in America or\r\nBritain, but which have entirely different meanings in concrete\r\npractice. \"Democracy\" means \"free elections\"; \"free elections\" mean that\r\nthe people elect \"democratic leaders\"; but \"democratic leaders\" are not\r\nthe people who are elected in non-Communist countries. Non-Communist\r\nleaders are usually dubbed \"tools\" or \"stooges\" of something; they are\r\n\"servile\" or \"reactionary.\" Real \"democratic leaders\" are only those\r\npeople approved by the international Communist movement. It _knows_. By\r\n_science_.\r\n\r\nWhat was the net effect of such psychological warfare? In the first\r\nplace, much use of common terms without regard to ultimate fulfillment\r\nmeans that Communist propaganda is self-defeating. It can succeed only\r\nin situations of desperation, anarchy, or terror. That is satisfactory\r\nto the Communist leaders, because they think their _science_ tells them\r\nthat the capitalist states will lead to desperation, anarchy and terror\r\nanyhow. Secondly, Communist propaganda sacrifices all other values to\r\nthe propaganda. One has to be a religious fanatic (of the Marxist sort)\r\nto turn it out; one has to be ready for a totally new creed in order to\r\nkeep on accepting it. International understanding, patriotism,\r\ntruthfulness, freedom of action, artistic conscience--all these are\r\nsacrificed to propaganda. In the end, _everything is propaganda_ to the\r\nCommunist. Nothing which hurts Communism can be true. They have their\r\n_science_. (If you would like to look at this fabulous _science_, read\r\n_The Communist Manifesto_, V. I. Lenin's _The Teachings of Karl Marx_,\r\nand Stalin's latest current compilation of speeches. You will be\r\nimpressed by the crazy logic, the genuine but ill-informed zeal.) Third\r\nand most important, Communist psychological warfare is continuous. The\r\nthemes may change--sometimes provocative, sometimes almost\r\nconciliatory--but the machinery, the operation, does not. Communist\r\npropaganda is therefore seasoned and professional, dependent on a\r\npowerful police-state at home and on uneducated or emotionally ill\r\nfanatics abroad, except for those few countries where Communism is so\r\nstable as to attract hard-headed or practical idealistic men.\r\n\r\nThis Bolshevik success, rather than the splendid but short-lasting\r\naccomplishments of the Allies in World War I, kept psychological warfare\r\non the map. Modern Communism is permanent psychological warfare in\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe Communist leaders unwittingly made a tremendous mistake between 1922\r\nand 1927. They invited the military and political staff of the Chinese\r\nNationalists (Kuomintang) to cooperate with them. Filled with their own\r\nCommunist sense of certainty, it never occurred to them that anyone else\r\ncould outsmart them. The Chinese did. Their military chief of mission in\r\nMoscow learned everything that the Communists had to teach about\r\nirregular fighting, subversive propaganda, revolutionary situations,\r\nmass agitation. He then went home and got more Communist aid to carry\r\nout the military phase of the Nationalist revolution, which started\r\nunder way in the summer of 1922. The old war-lord armies were helpless\r\nin the face of agents, agitators, poster crews, student strikes, press\r\npropaganda and indoctrinated troops. The most sensational war in modern\r\nAsia involved relatively little combat. The Nationalist leader used all\r\nthe Communist psychological warfare techniques, and added a few more of\r\nhis own. His name was Chiang Kai-shek.\r\n\r\nIn 1927 the Communists began a debate in Moscow as to whether they had\r\nused the Nationalists enough or not. One group said they might as well\r\nliquidate the Nationalists, Sunyatsenism, Chiang Kai-shek and all; the\r\nother said they should use the Nationalists a little longer, to carry on\r\nthe struggle against American, Japanese, and British \"imperialism.\"\r\nChiang Kai-shek displayed a keen interest in these formal theoretical\r\ndiscussions which, thanks to his Moscow training, he understood\r\nperfectly. While the Communists were still debating when and how to\r\nhijack him, he hijacked them. In the fall of 1927, he turned against\r\nthem, using the weapons of terror and propaganda, and then shifting to\r\nthe more solid ground of economic development. They have not forgiven\r\nhim. Nationalist China to this day possesses a working duplicate of the\r\nMoscow propaganda facilities which the Communists, unconscious of the\r\nhumor of it, call \"fascist.\" (What is anti-Communist for whatever cause\r\n_is_ Fascist, they say.)\r\n\r\nThe Russian revolution of 1917-1922 and the Chinese revolution of\r\n1922-1927 represent the situations created by Communist psychological\r\nwarfare. Since that time, except for Spain, Communist psychological\r\nwarfare has failed in every single attempt to come to power outside\r\nRussia. Following World War II, Communist psychological warfare proved\r\nitself capable of holding countries only _after_ the military force had\r\noccupied or won them. The magic has gone out of Communist propaganda; it\r\ncan keep control only with heavy military pressure behind it. But in the\r\nfar past, it has been capable of winning--as in Russia and\r\nChina--without outside military aid. With a renovation of techniques,\r\ndoctrines, and personnel, it may do so again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6\r\n\r\nPsychological Warfare in World War II\r\n\r\n\r\nBolshevik accomplishments in psychological warfare were often regarded\r\nas part of the peculiar mischief of Marxism, not as techniques which\r\ncould be learned and used by other people. Similarly, the history-making\r\nsweep of the Chinese Nationalist armies northward in 1922-1927 was\r\nconsidered to be specially and incomprehensibly Chinese; possible\r\nlessons which might have been learned from Chinese Communist\r\npsychological warfare were left unheeded by officials and students in\r\nthe West. Meanwhile Germany, the greatest power of Europe, had been\r\nfighting bitter internal psychological warfare battles[24] which looked\r\nlike heated internal politics. Not until Adolf Hitler assumed the\r\nReich's Chancellorship and began using his Brown-shirt methods for\r\nforeign affairs did other people wake up to the existence and\r\napplication of the new weapon.\r\n\r\n(The War College files, for example, show that not one single officer\r\nwas assigned full-time to study of these problems during 1925-1935. For\r\nthe entire period 1919-1929, there are listed only two War College\r\nresearch papers on the subject. Yet the American Army was far from\r\nnegligent. It was an excellent army, though crippled by outright poverty\r\nof personnel and materials. The Army was simply American, and like the\r\nrest of America for a while took the world for granted.)\r\n\r\nThe National Socialist German Workers' Party, as Hitler called his\r\nmovement, was a conglomerate built up around a few determined fanatics.\r\nThe Nazis do not appear to have believed their own doctrines to anything\r\nlike the degree to which the Communists believed theirs. From the first,\r\nthe Nazis regarded propaganda very consciously as a new, fierce\r\ninstrument which led to the accomplishment of _modern_ power. The\r\nCommunists had proclaimed that democracy was a fake; the Nazis agreed.\r\nThe Communists had shown that a minority with a sacred mission of its\r\nown invention could get mass support for a government that claimed to be\r\n_for_ the people, even though it was obviously not by the people nor\r\n_of_ them. The Nazis took this as a model. The Communists had shown that\r\na modern man-god could be set up and worshipped in a twentieth-century\r\nstate, and called leader (_Vozhd_ in Russian). The Nazis elevated the\r\nSoviet practice all the way into a principle, the principle of the\r\nleader (_Führer_ in German).\r\n\r\nThe Communists had shown that an organization calling itself a _party_,\r\nactually a quasi-religious hierarchy with strong internal discipline,\r\ndefinite membership, and active organizational components, could control\r\nfifty times its own membership. The Nazis organized the same general\r\nsort of party, copying the Italian Fascists in part, but copying more\r\nfrom the direct example of the German Communists right in front of them.\r\nThe Communists had shown that such a movement needed to have youth\r\nbranches, women's organizations, labor sections, clubs of its own, and\r\nso on, calling this \"mass organization.\" The Nazis copied this too.\r\n\r\nThe machinery of Naziism was in many ways a copy of Communism, applied\r\nto allegedly different ends, (the Nazis had an Aryan myth; the\r\nCommunists had their pseudo-economics). But the important thing about\r\nthem both was the destruction of the _end_ by the _means_; the problem\r\nof getting and keeping power despite the people was so obsessive that\r\npropaganda became all-important. Theoretically, the _end_ (to the Nazi,\r\nGerman world rule; to the Communist, the fulfillment of history in\r\nuniversal communism) was the most important thing. But since any means\r\nat any time which led to that end was good, and since the Party bosses\r\nwere the sole ones who could determine whether a particular action led\r\nto the very remote end or not, the outcome in both Russia and Germany\r\nbecame the conscienceless seeking of power for its own sake.\r\n\r\nThe new psychological warfare, a cause as well as a means of World War\r\nII, arose from the subjection of other considerations to _propaganda_.\r\nThe propaganda addict takes everything with a ton of salt; what he does\r\nbelieve is lost in what he doesn't believe. The ordinary controls of\r\ncivilized life--regard for truth, regard for law, respect for neighbors,\r\nobedience to good manners, love of God--cease to operate effectively,\r\nbecause the propaganda-dizzy man sees in everything its propaganda\r\ncontent and nothing else. Everything, from a girl dancing on a stage to\r\nan ecclesiastic officiating in a cathedral, is either _for_ him or\r\n_against_ him. Nothing is innocent; nothing is pleasurable; everything\r\nis connected with his diseased apprehension of power. Before he gets\r\npower, he hates the people who have power; he does not trust their\r\nintelligence, esteem their personalities, believe in their good will, or\r\ncredit their motives.[25] They must be scum, because they hold power\r\nwhen _he_, the propaganda-infatuated man, is a member of the group that\r\n_should_ hold it. Yet when such a man comes to power he hates his\r\ncolleagues and comrades. Remembering the cold cynical way in which he\r\nhimself sought power, knowing that his brother fanatics have the same\r\nruthless arrogance, the propaganda-using Party man cannot trust anyone.\r\nBlood purges, mass trials, liquidations, removal of families,\r\nconcealment of crimes--all these result from the establishment of\r\npropaganda in an overdeveloped role.\r\n\r\nIt is against such people that we--ordinary folk, Americans--dared wage\r\npsychological warfare during World War II. Propaganda had grown into\r\nideology; the world was convulsed with monstrous new religions. For\r\ninstance: the greatest journalist of the Soviet Union, Karl Radek, was\r\nplaced on trial for treason. He was asked by the prosecutor, Vyshinsky,\r\n\r\n\"These actions of yours were deliberate?\"\r\n\r\nRadek answered: \"Apart from sleeping, I have never in my life committed\r\nany undeliberate actions.\"[26]\r\n\r\nThis answer sums up the mood of the totalitarian who is obsessed by\r\npropaganda. He comes to believe that all activity, whether his own or of\r\nother people, has meaning. He had developed the sense of responsibility\r\nthat made him violate tenets which Americans, in a free society, regard\r\nas fundamental to human nature: things like self-respect, kindliness,\r\nlove of family, pity for the unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThis kind of mentality was found chiefly in the National Socialist and\r\nCommunist states, and to a lesser degree in dictatorships such as Italy;\r\nby contrast, reactionary Japan was almost democratic. This mentality\r\nmakes it possible for the ruler to control his own people enough to\r\nundertake \"warfare psychologically waged.\" Without domestic fanaticism\r\nand domestic terror, governments have to fall back on \"psychological\r\nwarfare\"--that is, the mere supplementing of politics and military\r\noperations by propaganda. It is vain to expect a free people in a free\r\ncountry to submit to such humiliating control, even for the purpose of\r\nwinning a war. What made the psychological warfare of World War II\r\npeculiar was the fact that our enemies fought one kind of war (\"warfare\r\npsychologically waged,\" or total war) and we fought them back with\r\nanother. Theoretically, it is possible to argue that we had no business\r\nsucceeding.\r\n\r\nBut we did succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Pre-Belligerent Stages.= The propaganda-conscious Axis states had\r\nfirst to control their own people enough to wage aggressive war. They\r\nthen had to split their possible enemies, to make piecemeal victory\r\npossible. They had to stay on good terms with the Soviet Union (Hitler\r\ntill 1941; Japan till the last week of war). They had to frighten their\r\nimmediate enemies while assuring their eventual enemies. This called for\r\na great deal of propaganda.\r\n\r\nPre-belligerent operations required extensive use of \"black\" propaganda.\r\nSince their political systems aroused hostility and anger in audiences\r\nwhich they wished to address, the aggressors sought to disguise their\r\npropaganda. They used pacifist groups to keep the democracies from\r\nrearming. Militarist groups were encouraged to keep the democracies from\r\nundertaking domestic reforms or discussing military matters with Russia.\r\nFinancial groups were contacted to preserve the fiction of normal\r\ninternational relations. Cultural groups were employed to preserve\r\nfriendliness for their respective nationalities as such. The Japanese\r\ndid a little global propaganda and for a while subsidized several\r\nmagazines in this country, but in general they concentrated their main\r\neffort in the immediate area of their military operations.\r\n\r\nIt was the Germans who developed world-wide pre-belligerent propaganda\r\nto a fine art. They exploited every possible disunity which could\r\ncontribute to the weakness of an enemy. They were not choosy about\r\ncollaborators. If the Communist Party of the United States lent a hand\r\n(as it did between September, 1939 and June, 1941, terming the war \"an\r\nimperialist war\"; after Russia got in, the war was called \"the\r\ndemocratic anti-fascist war\"), the Nazis did not object. They willingly\r\nlistened to men who had fantastic schemes for world peace and later used\r\nsuch men as aids in getting appeasement. They tried to rouse Catholics\r\nagainst Communists, Communists against democrats, Gentiles against Jews,\r\nwhites against negroes, the poor against the rich, the rich against the\r\npoor, British against Americans, Americans against British--anyone\r\nagainst anyone, as long as it delayed action against Germany and\r\nweakened the enemy potential. They went to special pains to organize\r\nGerman-speaking minorities in non-German countries, but they never\r\nneglected using people who had no open connection with Naziism at all.\r\n\r\nThis work was performed, so far as the open propaganda itself was\r\nconcerned, through the instrumentalities of the Reich's Ministry for\r\nPropaganda and Popular Enlightenment under control of that malignant\r\nintelligence, Paul Josef Göbbels. The broader program was not solely a\r\npublicity matter, and was operated chiefly through Party channels. The\r\nGerman capacity to learn was demonstrated by the contrast between World\r\nWar I and World War II. In World War I the Germans lacked political\r\nmotifs, professionalism, and coordination; in World War II they had all\r\nof these.\r\n\r\n\r\n=German Accomplishments.= Three basic propaganda accomplishments were\r\nachieved by the Germans. First, in the political warfare field, they\r\nsucceeded in making large sections of world opinion believe that the\r\nworld's future was a choice between Communism and Fascism. Since they\r\nand the Communists agreed on this the point seemed well taken. Actually,\r\nthere is no historical or economic justification for supposing that\r\nthose two forms of dictatorship constitute a real choice in the first\r\nplace, or that the civilized and truly free countries need ever depart\r\nfrom their ancient freedoms in the second place.\r\n\r\nSecond, in the strategic field, they made each victim seem the last.\r\nThere was still hope that war would not arise, even while the Spanish\r\nRepublic was being strangled before the eyes of the world. The British\r\nhoped that they could stay out even after Czechoslovakia fell. Astute\r\nthough the Russians were, they hoped to stay out even after Britain and\r\nFrance fought. And as late as December 6, 1941 many Americans still\r\nbelieved that the United States would avoid war. This suited the Nazis'\r\nbook; take them on one at a time.\r\n\r\nThirdly, in the purely psychological field the Germans used outright\r\nfright. They made their own people afraid of Communist liquidations.\r\nThey brazenly showed movies of their blitzkriegs to the governing groups\r\nof prospective victims, just to lower morale. When one nation is really\r\nready to fight, and the other knows it, the nation that doesn't want to\r\nfight can be reduced to something resembling a nervous breakdown by\r\nconstant uncertainty. (The author was in Chungking during the summer of\r\n1940, when the German propaganda agent, Wolf Schenke, showed these\r\nGerman movies to the Chinese leaders. The author asked for an invitation\r\nand did not get it; it was for Chinese only, said Schenke. But the\r\nChinese were not awed, or made fearful of the power of Japan's ally.\r\nThey simply said, \"Nice movie ... that's the kind of thing we used to do\r\nin the Ch'in dynasty,\" and let it go at that.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=The British-German Radio War.= With the outbreak of war the British and\r\nGermans found radio at hand. Neither had to change broadcasting policies\r\na great deal. Each could reach almost all of Europe on standard-wave;\r\neach could jam the other's wave lengths, never with complete success,\r\nand the struggle centered around a contest for attention. Who could get\r\nthe most attention? Who could get the most credence? Who could affect\r\nthe beliefs, emotions, loyalties of friendly, neutral, and enemy\r\nlisteners the most?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 14: Radio Program Leaflet, Anzio, 1944._ These\r\nleaflets were dropped by the Germans on American troops at Anzio in\r\nApril 1944. They show an interesting tie-in between two forms of\r\npropaganda. The counterpropaganda to the British Broadcasting\r\nCorporation is slight; chief emphasis is on entertainment value of the\r\nGerman radio programs. (From photograph taken by Signal Corps and\r\nreleased through War Department Bureau of Public Relations.)]\r\n\r\nThe Germans showed evidence of real planning. Their public relations\r\nfacilities were perfectly geared to their propaganda facilities. When\r\nthe Germans wanted to build the British up for a let-down, they withheld\r\nmilitary news favorable to themselves. During the fight for Norway, they\r\neven spread rumors of British successes, knowing that if British morale\r\nwent up for a day or two, it would come down all the harder when\r\nauthentic bad news came through the War Office. When the Germans wanted\r\nto turn on a war of nerves, their controlled press screamed against the\r\nvictim; when they turned it off their press was silent. The Germans thus\r\nhad the advantage of not needing to make much distinction between news,\r\npublicity, and propaganda. All three served the same purpose, the\r\nimmediate needs of the Reich.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 15: Radio Leaflet Surrender Form, Anzio, 1944._\r\nWillingness of prisoners to surrender sometimes involves speedy\r\ncommunication of their names to their families, as in the preceding\r\nillustrations. At other times, prisoners are very unwilling to be\r\nidentified and want their faces masked. This leaflet combines radio\r\nprogram announcements with the standard surrender pass.]\r\n\r\nThe Germans put on the following types of news propaganda:\r\n\r\n  (1) Official OKW (_Oberkommando der Wehrmacht_, or _Wehrmacht_ HQ)\r\n  communiqués. (These rarely departed from the truth, though they\r\n  naturally gave favorable situations in detail and unfavorable ones\r\n  scantily.)\r\n\r\n  (2) Official government releases, marked by considerable dignity,\r\n  possessing more political content than the military communiqués.\r\n\r\n  (3) News of the world, part of it repeated from the British radio,\r\n  part plain non-controversial news (for stuffing), and part (the most\r\n  important part) news of genuine curiosity value to the listeners but\r\n  which, at the same time, had the propaganda effect of damaging belief\r\n  in the Allied cause.\r\n\r\n  (4) Feature items, comparable to feature articles in newspapers, which\r\n  tried to concentrate on a single topic or theme.\r\n\r\n  (5) Recognized commentators, speaking openly and officially.\r\n\r\n  (6) Pseudonymous commentators, pretending to speak from a viewpoint\r\n  different from that of the German Government, but who were announced\r\n  as being broadcast over the official German radio system. (Of these\r\n  the British traitor William Joyce, since hanged, known as \"Lord Haw\r\n  Haw,\" was the most notorious. His colleagues were the American\r\n  traitors Fred Kaltenbach and Douglas Chandler. At the end of the war\r\n  Chandler was tried in Boston and sentenced to life imprisonment but\r\n  Kaltenbach fell into Soviet custody and died.)\r\n\r\n  (7) Falsified stations, which pretended to have nothing at all to do\r\n  with Germany. (The \"New British Broadcasting Company\" transmitted\r\n  defeatist propaganda with a superficial anti-German tone. Others took\r\n  a strong Communist line and sought to build up opposition to the\r\n  British government within England.)\r\n\r\n  (8) Falsified quotations on the official German radio. (Sometimes it\r\n  was easier to make up an imaginary foreign source, ostensibly quoted\r\n  in the German program, rather than to set up a special fake program\r\n  for the purpose.)\r\n\r\n  (9) \"Planted\" news sources quoted on the German radio. (A great deal\r\n  of the German news was culled out of Swedish, Spanish and other papers\r\n  which were either secretly German-controlled or which--as in the case\r\n  of the United States papers involved--were so sympathetic to Germany\r\n  that they voluntarily printed German-inspired news which the Nazis\r\n  could then quote from a \"neutral\" or \"enemy\" source.)\r\n\r\n  (10) Open falsification of BBC (British Broadcasting Company, the\r\n  official British agency) materials--at which the Germans were not\r\n  necessarily caught by their ordinary listeners, but at which BBC\r\n  caught them.\r\n\r\n  (11) Ghost voices and ghost programs, transmitted on legitimate Allied\r\n  wave lengths when the Allied transmitters went off the air, or else\r\n  interrupting the Allied broadcasts by transmitting simultaneously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 16: Invitation to Treason._ Another German\r\nleaflet, also from Anzio, combines the radio surrender-notice form with\r\na political invitation to Britishers to commit treason. The Germans had\r\na few British traitors in their \"Legion of St. George,\" and a few\r\nAmerican civilian renegades, but in general this line of appeal was\r\nuseless. The last paragraph of the appeal is such naïve trickery that it\r\nprobably aroused suspicion in the minds of the men it was supposed to\r\npersuade.]\r\n\r\nOf all these, it was soon found that the communiqués and government\r\nreleases were the most important, although the bulk of the station time\r\nhad to be diversified with other types of program. The Germans and\r\nBritish both found that radio was important as a starting point for\r\nnews. It was more valuable to have the press (as in England) or rumor\r\n(as in Germany) pass along an item than it was to rely on the direct\r\nlisteners. Each side sought to make opinion analyses of the enemy; some\r\nof the British studies were clever in technique. The radio propagandists\r\nhad to ask themselves _why_ they made propaganda. It is simple to make\r\nmischief, spreading rumors or putting practical jokes into circulation.\r\nSuch antics do not necessarily advance a military-political cause.\r\nSustained psychological warfare required--as both British and German\r\nradio soon found out--a deliberate calculation of the particular enemy\r\nframe of mind to be cultivated over a long period of time. When radio\r\nstations had to broadcast day after day whether anything happened or\r\nnot, it became difficult to continue to circulate news without faking it\r\nand losing the confidence of enemy listeners.\r\n\r\nOn the German side, the German radio had the forced attention of the\r\nentire world. As long as the Germans had the strategic initiative for\r\nfield warfare, they were in a position to make news scoops whenever it\r\nsuited them. The security policies of the Allies often gave the Germans\r\na monopoly of news on a given operation. There was never any danger that\r\nthe Germans were not listened in on; the danger the Nazi operators had\r\nto worry about was disbelief. Hence the Germans tried to keep a moderate\r\ntone in their news, tried to prepare between crises for the news that\r\nwould become sensational during crises.\r\n\r\nThe Germans soon learned a basic principle of war radio. They learned\r\nnot to permit radio to run ahead of their military capacities. At first,\r\nwhen their spokesmen promised attainment of a given goal by a given\r\ntime, and the army failed to live up to the schedule, the British radio\r\npicked up the unfulfilled promise and dangled it before the world as\r\nproof that the Germans were weakening. The Germans thereupon effected\r\nArmy-radio liaison so that the radio people could promise only those\r\nthings which the army was reasonably sure of delivering. (When Allied\r\npropaganda analysis woke up to this fact, it added one more source of\r\ncorroboratory intelligence to be checked. (See page 126.))\r\n\r\nThe British had their hands full getting news out in the languages of\r\nthe occupied countries. It was immensely difficult for them to follow\r\nthe politics of the underground. German counterespionage, under the\r\ndeadly _Sicherheitsdienst_, made it difficult to keep track of opinion\r\nin the occupied countries. Work against Naziism depended on the temper\r\nof the people; propaganda against collaborators had to distinguish\r\nbetween outright evil collaborators and those public officials who\r\nstayed on out of a sense of mistaken or necessary duty. The British did\r\nnot necessarily announce themselves at any time as anti-Communist, and\r\ncollaborated for short-range purposes with Communists all over the\r\nContinent. Mr. Churchill himself shifted his North Balkan political\r\nsupport from Mikhailovich to Broz-Tito. But it was vitally necessary to\r\nknow just how and when to change support from one group to the other.\r\nSince the undergrounds had very few radio transmitters, and none of\r\nthese was reliable during most of the war, the British faced the task of\r\nproviding radio facilities for all of the occupied countries. The\r\nconsequence was to make their radio warfare highly sensitive to\r\npolitics; they had to address the right people with the right language\r\nat the right time, on penalty of failure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 17: Anti-Radio Leaflet._ Sometimes\r\nground-distributed leaflets were used in an attempt to counteract enemy\r\nradio propaganda. This leaflet, circulated in France by the Nazis, uses\r\nthe form of an Allied leaflet and accuses the Armed SS of wanting such\r\nthings as a decent Europe, and end to atrocious killings every\r\ntwenty-five years, and a worthy life. Allied broadcasters are identified\r\nas Jews.]\r\n\r\nTo effect this end, the British set up an agency which never had an\r\nAmerican counterpart, the Political Warfare Executive (known by its\r\ninitials, PWE). This agency had representation from the War Office, the\r\nAdmiralty, the Foreign Office, and the Ministry of Information. The PWE\r\nwas the policy-servicing and coordinating agency for all British\r\nexternal propaganda, and left the execution of its operations to the\r\nMinistry of Information (MOI) and to the British Broadcasting\r\nCorporation (BBC). British radio propaganda maintained a high level of\r\neffectiveness. American officials and propagandists often complained\r\nthat the British were running the entire war in their own national\r\ninterest. The charge was unjust. The British had facilities for knowing\r\nexactly what they wished to do and when they wished to do it. If the\r\nAmericans came along without clear policies or propaganda purposes, it\r\nwas natural that the British should take the lead and let the Americans\r\nstring along if they wished. Furthermore, the British were usually\r\nscrupulous in yielding to America's primary interest in areas they felt\r\nto be American problems--Japan, China, the Philippines. They were least\r\ncooperative when the OWI tried to spread the ideals of Mr. Henry Wallace\r\nin Burma or to explain the CIO-PAC to the Hindus.\r\n\r\nNo clear victor emerged from the Anglo-German radio war; the victory of\r\nthe United Nations gave the British the last say. In the opinion of\r\nmany, the British were one war ahead of the United States. They had\r\nprofited by their World War I experience, and by their two years'\r\noperational lead which they had on the Americans. But side-by-side with\r\nthe Germans, it is harder to appraise their net achievements. The\r\nBritish had immense political advantages; the resentment of a conquered\r\ncontinent worked for them. But they had disadvantages too. The enemy\r\nworked from the starting point of a fanatical and revolutionary\r\nphilosophy; the British had the tedious old world to offer. The postwar\r\ninterrogations of civilians in Germany showed that an amazingly high\r\nproportion of them had heard BBC broadcasts, and that many of the ideas\r\nand attitudes which the British propagandized were actually transmitted\r\nto the enemy. On the British side, it is almost impossible to find any\r\nsurviving traces of the effect of Nazi propaganda. Had the war been\r\npurely a radio war this test might be conclusive. But if psychological\r\nwarfare supplements combat, combat certainly supplements propaganda. The\r\ngreat British and American air raids over Europe unquestionably created\r\nan intense interest in British and American plans and purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is historically interesting to note that the Germans went on fighting\r\npsychological warfare even after the death of Hitler and the surrender\r\nof the jury-rigged government of Grossadmiral Karl Doenitz, which\r\nfunctioned 6-23 May 1945 at Flensburg under Allied toleration. This\r\nresulted from the inability of the 21st Army Group swiftly to initiate\r\ninformation control. The Flensburg radio, still under Nazi direction,\r\nemphasized Anglo-American differences with the Soviet Union in every\r\npossible way short of direct appeals. German naval radio also carried on\r\npropaganda for a while, using topics such as the sportsmanship of the\r\nGerman surrender, the hatred of the German Navy for atrocities committed\r\nby the Nazis, and the usefulness of the phantom government to the\r\nWestern Allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Black Propaganda.= Subversive operations formed a major part of the\r\nNazi pre-belligerent effort. The Germans planted or converted quislings\r\nwherever they could, and when they failed to have time to prearrange\r\nstooges they converted them rapidly after arrival. (A major cause of the\r\nGerman defeat is to be found in the fantastic political policies\r\nfollowed in the Ukraine and neighboring Soviet Socialist Republics. In\r\nthese areas, despite the Soviet boast that Russia had no fifth\r\ncolumnists within her borders, the Germans found thousands of helpers.\r\nThe Nazis organized a large army (General Vlassov's Russian Army of\r\nLiberation) out of Soviet prisoners, and these troops were usable and\r\ndocile. But in the political warfare field the Germans were too\r\ncocksure. They let their men go wild in orgies of cruelty against the\r\nlocal population; the economic system went entirely to pieces. The\r\nnatives then became convinced that the worst possible conditions of\r\nSovietism were infinitely better than the best that Naziism could\r\noffer.)\r\n\r\nThese subversive groups were formed by political means. Propaganda aid\r\nwas offered to such an extent that it was often difficult to tell how\r\nmuch of the quisling movement was spontaneously native, and how much\r\nmere cover for a purely German operation.\r\n\r\nIn the latter phase of the European war, the Russian Communists followed\r\nthe German Nazi example of having tame natives ready to take over the\r\ngovernment of occupied areas. In Poland, the so-called Lublin Committee\r\ntook over the government from the constitutional Polish\r\nGovernment-in-exile at London. In Jugoslavia, the Russian-trained\r\npropagandist, Tito, seized the leadership from the recognized Minister\r\nof War, Draja Mikhailovich, after the British and American governments\r\nhad shifted their support to him; later Mikhailovich was put to death.\r\nThe Russian army brought along to Germany a considerable number of\r\nGerman Communists. In Czechoslovakia the strength of the constitutional\r\nregime was such as to compel the pro-Russians to allow the prewar\r\nleadership a precarious toehold in the new government. The same cadres\r\nof sympathetic persons who had been useful as propaganda sources for\r\npsychological warfare during the period of hostilities became useful\r\ninstruments of domination after hostilities ended. The British and\r\nAmericans, with their belief that government should spring from the\r\nliberated and defeated peoples, did not prepare and equip comparable\r\ngroups to rival the Communist candidates; only in Italy and Greece did\r\nthe friends of the Western Allies stay in power, and then only because\r\nthey were the nearest equivalent of _de jure_ authorities. In the\r\nScandinavian and Low Countries the national leadership reemerged without\r\nprodding or interference by the Western Allies; they passed from the\r\nsphere of psychological warfare (that is, of being someone's cover) to\r\nthat of world politics.\r\n\r\nSpecific black propaganda operations were of considerable value.\r\nHowever, black propaganda is more difficult to appraise than overt\r\npropaganda. Analytical and historical studies, gauging the results\r\nobtained by Black operations in relation to their cost, are not yet\r\navailable. (Certain particular operations are described later in this\r\nbook, pages 208 and 237.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=American Operations: OWI and OSS.= Long after the outbreak of war in\r\nthe Far East, and even after the coming of full war in Europe, neither\r\nthe civilian nor military portions of the American government possessed\r\npropaganda facilities. This is not as serious as it may sound, for the\r\nUnited States is lucky in possessing a people well agreed on most\r\nfundamentals. The commercial press, radio, magazine, and book publishing\r\nfacilities of the country for the most part expressed a national point\r\nof view without being prodded. (The isolationist issue never brought in\r\nthe question of America's basic character.) Before the war, and even\r\nafter the government entered the field, private American news and\r\npublishing continued to engage in operations which had the effect if\r\nnot the intention of propaganda. OWI at its most vigorous could scarcely\r\nhave reached the audience that had been built up by the\r\n_Time-Life-Fortune_ group, not to mention the _Reader's Digest_, both of\r\nwhich became truly global in coverage during the war years. American\r\nmovies already had a world-wide audience. The propaganda turned out\r\nunwittingly by such agencies may not have had the gloss and political\r\nsmoothness of Dr. Paul Josef Göbbels best productions, but it had\r\nsomething no government propaganda had--the possession of a readership\r\nall of which was unmistakably voluntary, obtained by the appeal of\r\nauthentic interest and entertainment--and proved by an ability to charm\r\nmoney out of people's pockets.\r\n\r\nThe American problem of propaganda was thus not a simple one. Total\r\npsychological warfare was out of reach if we were to remain a free\r\npeople. Otherwise the simple-seeming thing to have done would have been\r\nto put a government supervisor in every newspaper, radio station and\r\nmagazine in the country, and coordinate the whole bunch of them together\r\nin the national interest. Simple-seeming. Actually, such an attempt\r\nwould have been utter madness, touching off a furious political fight\r\nwithin the country and meeting legal obstacles which would have remained\r\ninsurmountable as long as there was a Constitution with courts to\r\nenforce it. The simplest official action which the United States could\r\ntake was therefore hedged about by the presence of private competitors\r\nwho would watch it enviously, jealous of their established rights and\r\nprivileges, and by the operational interference which vigorous private\r\nmedia would have on public media.\r\n\r\nThe then Mr. or Colonel, later General, William Donovan had tasted the\r\ndelights of political warfare when President Roosevelt sent him to\r\nBelgrade to talk the Serbs into fighting instead of surrendering. He was\r\nsuccessful; the Serbs fought. He came back to the United States with a\r\npractical knowledge of what political warfare could do if qualified\r\npersonnel operated on the spot. The outbreak of the Russo-German war\r\nlent urgency to American action in the political-intelligence field as\r\nwell as in the propaganda field. On 11 July, 1941 President Roosevelt\r\nissued an order appointing Colonel Donovan as Coordinator of\r\nInformation. The agency became known by the initials COI.[27]\r\n\r\nThe primary mission of COI was the collection of information and its\r\nprocessing for immediate use. Large numbers of experts were brought into\r\nits Research and Analysis Branch, designed to do for the United States\r\nin weeks what the research facilities of the Germans and Japanese had\r\ndone for them over a matter of years. The inflow of material was\r\ntremendous and the gearing of scholarship to the war effort produced\r\nlarge quantities of political, sociological, geographic, economic and\r\nother monographs, most of them carefully classified SECRET, even when\r\nthey were copied out of books in the Library of Congress. However, it\r\nwas not the research wing of the COI that entered the broadcasting\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nRadio work was first done by an agency within COI called FIS--Foreign\r\nInformation Service. In the few months before Pearl Harbor the group\r\nbecame organized in New York under the leadership of Robert Sherwood,\r\nthe dramatist, and got a start in supplying the radio companies with\r\nmaterial. The radio scripts were poorly checked; there was chaos in the\r\nmatter of policy; little policing was possible, and the output reflected\r\nthe enthusiasm of whatever individual happened to be near the\r\nmicrophone. Colonel Donovan had moved into this work without written and\r\nexclusive authorization from the White House; hence there followed a\r\nlamentable interval of almost two years' internal struggle between\r\nAmerican agencies--a struggle not really settled until the summer of\r\n1943, well into the second year of war. The occasion for struggle arose\r\nfrom lack of uniform day-to-day propaganda policy and from an unclear\r\ndivision of authority between the operating agencies. But the work was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nRadio operations had to be coordinated with strategy on the one hand and\r\nforeign policy on the other, and we sought to develop methods for doing\r\nthis. It is significant that all the major difficulties of American\r\npsychological warfare were administrative and not operational. There was\r\nnever any serious trouble about getting the facilities, the writers, the\r\ntranslators, the telecommunications technicians. What caused trouble\r\nwere problems of personality and personal power, resulting chiefly from\r\nthe lack of any consensus on the method or organization of propaganda\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nMilitary Intelligence Division had created an extremely secret\r\npsychological warfare office at about the time that the COI was\r\nestablished; this had broad intelligence and policy functions, but no\r\noperational facilities. It was headed by Lieutenant Colonel Percy Black,\r\nwho began auspiciously by putting Dr. Edwin Guthrie in office as his\r\nsenior psychological adviser. This ultra-quiet office was called Special\r\nStudy Group; it and the COI developed very loose cooperative relations,\r\nconsisting chiefly of SSG making suggestions to COI which COI might or\r\nmight not use as it saw fit. Meanwhile, the Rockefeller Office was\r\nconducting independent broadcasts to Latin America; the Office of Facts\r\nand Figures was dispensing domestic information; and at the height of\r\nthe psychological warfare campaigning, there were at least nine\r\nunrelated agencies in Washington, all directly connected with\r\npsychological warfare, and none actually subject to the control of any\r\nof the others.[28]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chart I_\r\n\r\n  STATE-------WAR---------PRESIDENT--WHITE--OFFICE OF-NAVY--------OFFICE OF\r\n  DEPARTMENT  DEPARTMENT  |       +--HOUSE  ECONOMIC  DEPARTMENT  STRATEGIC\r\n     |         |          |      |   STAFF  WARFARE       |       SERVICES\r\n     |         |          |     |       |     |           |           |\r\n     |         |          |    |      |       |           |           |\r\n     |    G2  I&E   BPR   |   |      |-------++---------+-+----------++\r\n     |     +---+-----+    |  |      |        |           |           |\r\n     |               |    | |      |         |           |           |\r\n  OFFICE OF     EACH THEATER   OFFICE OF----OTHER-----OTHER----INTER-ALLIED\r\n  COORDINATOR--------+|  |+----WAR          CABINET   WAR      FACILITIES\r\n  OF INTER-                    INFORMATION  AGENCIES  AGENCIES\r\n  AMERICAN--------+         +-----+  |  +--+\r\n  AFFAIRS          |       |         |      |\r\n     |              |     |          |       |\r\n  SEMIOFFICIAL       |   |           |        +-----+\r\n  PRIVATE          UNOFFICIAL      COMMERCIAL    COMMERCIAL    ^       ^\r\n  AGENCIES---------AGENCIES          RADIO       (PRIVATE)     |       |\r\n                                                 PUBLISHERS     |      |\r\n                                                                 |     |\r\n                                                                  |    |\r\n                                                                  ANYBODY\r\n                                                           <---  WHO FELT\r\n                                                                LIKE TRYING\r\n\r\n\r\n(Source: The author's observations.)]\r\n\r\nA year of wrangling produced the solution, after a Joint Psychological\r\nWarfare Committee had been set up under the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and\r\nhad failed to fulfill an effective policy-supervising function. On 13\r\nJune, 1942 the President created the Office of War Information. This\r\nagency was given control directly or indirectly over all domestic\r\npropaganda, and over white propaganda abroad, except for the Western\r\nHemisphere, which remained under the Rockefeller Committee in the State\r\nDepartment. The FIS was taken from the COI, and the COI took on the new\r\nname of OSS--Office of Strategic Services--under which it retained three\r\nmajor functions:\r\n\r\n  (1) continuation of scholastic and informal intelligence;\r\n\r\n  (2) black propaganda operations (given _explicit_ authority only in\r\n  March, 1943);\r\n\r\n  (3) subversive operations, in collaboration with regular military\r\n  authority.\r\n\r\nThe OWI was placed under Mr. Elmer Davis, a Rhodes scholar and novelist\r\nwho had become one of the nation's most popular radio commentators. The\r\nFIS was perpetuated under the control of Mr. Robert Sherwood, who had a\r\nmost extraordinary coterie of odd personalities assisting him: Socialist\r\nrefugees, advertising men, psychologists, psychoanalysts (of both the\r\nlicensed and lay varieties), professional promoters, theatrical types,\r\nGerman professors, a commercial attaché, young men just out of college,\r\noil executives, and popular authors (novelists, slick writers, Pulitzer\r\nwinners, pulp writers, humorists, poets and a professional pro-Japanese\r\nwriter, fresh off the Imperial Japanese Embassy payroll).\r\n\r\nThe War Department agency, under the Military Intelligence Service of\r\nG-2, had been renamed Psychological Warfare Branch and had executed\r\nwithin the G-2 structure the equivalent of a knight's move in chess,\r\nending up at a new place on the TO with no observable change in function\r\nor authority; it had passed under the authority of Colonel (later\r\nBrigadier General) Oscar Solbert, a West Pointer with wide international\r\nand business experience; he had been out of the Army as a top official\r\nwith Eastman Kodak, after a cosmopolitan army career which sent him all\r\nover Europe and gave him one tour of duty as a White House aide. With\r\nthe establishment of OWI, Colonel Solbert's office fissiparated like an\r\namoeba; the civilian half of Psychological Warfare Branch, with a few\r\nofficers, went over to OWI to be a brain-trust for the foreign broadcast\r\nexperts, who failed to welcome this accession of talent; the military\r\nhalf remained as an MIS agency until 31 December, 1943, when OWI\r\nabolished its half and MIS cooperated by wiping out the other, leaving\r\nthe War Department in the middle of a war with no official psychological\r\nwarfare agency whatever, merely some liaison officers. Psychological\r\nwarfare became the responsibility of designated individual officers in\r\nOPD--(the Operations Division of the General Staff), an outfit\r\ncelebrated for conscientious overwork, as well as in MIS and the War\r\nDepartment got along very nicely. Meanwhile OWI and OSS fought one of\r\nthe many battles of Washington, each seeking control of foreign\r\npropaganda. The D.C. and Manhattan newspapers ran columns on this fight,\r\nalong with news of the fighting in Russia, Libya, and the Pacific. For\r\none glorious moment of OSS, it seemed that the President had signed over\r\nall foreign propaganda functions conducted outside the United States to\r\nOSS, cutting the OWI out of everything except its New York and San\r\nFrancisco transmitters; the OWI was stricken with gloom and collective\r\nindigestion. The next day, the mistake was rectified, and OWI\r\ntriumphantly planned raids on the jurisdiction of OSS. Meanwhile, the\r\nfollowing things were happening:\r\n\r\nHighly classified plans for psychological warfare were being drafted for\r\nboth the Joint and Combined Chiefs of Staff. These were discussed at\r\nvarious meetings and then classified a little higher, whereupon they\r\nwere locked up, lest the propaganda writers and broadcasters see them\r\nand break security on them by obeying and applying them.\r\n\r\nBroadcasts--thousands of words in dozens of languages--were transmitted\r\nto everyone on earth. They were written by persons who had little if any\r\ncontact with Federal policy, and none with the military establishment,\r\nexcept for formal security. The plans at the top bore no observable\r\nrelation to the operations at the bottom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chart II_\r\n\r\n  PRE-O.W.I. ORGANIZATION                              O.W.I.

We made up this\r\nleaflet quickly, and dropped it on the city while the exhibit was still\r\nin progress. (China, 1944.)]\r\n\r\nWhen Washington agencies wanted to find out what the broadcasts really\r\nwere saying, the actual working offices at New York and San Francisco,\r\ntheir feelings hurt at not having been consulted by the Joint Chiefs,\r\nrefused (on _their_ security ground) to let anyone see a word of what\r\nthey were sending out. This baffled other Washington agencies a great\r\ndeal. (The author, who was then detailed from the War Department to OWI,\r\noutflanked this move in one instance by getting a report on a San\r\nFrancisco Japanese Broadcast from the Navy Department. It had been\r\nmonitored by an American submarine out in the Pacific.)\r\n\r\nLarge overseas offices were set up at various foreign locations. Some of\r\nthese went down to work quickly, efficiently, smoothly, and did a\r\nfirst-class job of presenting wartime America to foreign peoples;\r\nothers, with the frailties of jerry-built government agencies, lapsed\r\ninto inefficiency, wild goose chases, or internal quarrels.\r\n\r\nLastly, the poor British officials continued to wander around\r\nWashington, looking for their American opposite numbers in the\r\npropaganda field--looking for one and always finding a dozen.\r\n\r\nThat was in 1942-1943.\r\n\r\nBy 1945, this had all become transformed into a large, well run, well\r\nintegrated organization. Three weeks before Japan fell, the OWI finally\r\nprepared an official index of its propaganda \"Directives\"--that, is, of\r\nthe official statement of what kinds of propaganda to make, what kinds\r\nnot to make. The overseas units had been associated with the\r\nmetropolitan short-wave. Personnel had been disciplined. Techniques had\r\nbecome more precise. Under the command of Lieutenant Commander Alexander\r\nLeighton, an M.D. who was also a psychiatrist and anthropologist,\r\ncareful techniques were devised for the analysis of Japanese and German\r\nmorale. Comparable though dissimilar work on Europe had been done by a\r\nstaff associated with Harold Lasswell. The propaganda expert Leonard W.\r\nDoob had been appointed controlling and certifying officer for every\r\nsingle order of importance.\r\n\r\nThe military relationship had been clarified. The War Department, acting\r\nthrough G-2, had reestablished a psychological warfare office under the\r\nnew name of Propaganda Branch, under the successive commands of\r\nLieutenant Colonel John B. Stanley, Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Buttles,\r\nand Colonel Dana W. Johnston. The new branch undertook no operations\r\nwhatever, but connected War Department with OWI and OSS for policy and\r\nliaison, and represented one-half of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (an\r\nappropriate naval officer from a comparable office representing the\r\nother half) at the weekly policy meetings of OWI. Military needs in\r\npsychological warfare had been settled by regarding the Theaters in this\r\nrespect as autonomous, and leaving to the respective Theater Commanders\r\nthe definition of their relationships with OWI and OSS, and their use of\r\neach. OSS and OWI had passed the stage of rival growth, and consulted\r\none another enough to prevent operational interference. Each had\r\nsufficient military or naval supervision to prevent interference with\r\ncryptographic security, communication and deception operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Lessons.= The major job of psychological warfare passed to the\r\nTheaters. In some theaters this was kept by the commander directly under\r\nhis own immediate supervision, and OWI was used simply as a propaganda\r\nservice of supply. In others, OWI was an almost independent agent. In\r\nsome places, OWI worked with OSS as in the European Theater, in others\r\nindependently, as in the China-Burma-India Theater. In one, it worked\r\ncompletely without OSS (SWPA), since General MacArthur did not let OSS\r\ninto his Theater at all. (OSS got in the general area anyhow; with Navy\r\npermission, it turned up blithely, highly nautical on Saipan.) These\r\nTheater establishments were the ones that set up local standard-wave\r\nprograms which the enemy could hear in volume. They provided the\r\nloudspeaker units which were taken right into combat. They serviced the\r\nground and air combat echelons with leaflets as needed. They moved along\r\nbehind the advances, opening up information booths and explaining to\r\nliberated natives why each did not get the four freedoms, the three\r\nmeals a day, and the new pair of shoes he thought he had been promised\r\nby the American radio.\r\n\r\nThese military establishments are better described under operations,\r\nsince it was their functioning which defined--down to the limit of\r\npresent-day experience--American military doctrine concerning the\r\nconduct of psychological warfare in theaters of war. In concluding the\r\nhistorical summary of psychological warfare, it is interesting to look\r\nat three major points which emerge plainly from the experience of World\r\nWar II--points which either were not discovered in World War I, or else\r\nfailed to make an impact on the minds of the responsible officials and\r\ninformed citizens.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is simple. It became almost a litany with Colonel\r\nOscar Solbert, when he sought to indoctrinate civilian geniuses with\r\nmilitary proprieties: _Psychological warfare is a function of command._\r\nIf command chooses to exercise it, it will succeed. If command neglects\r\nit, or if it is operated independently of military command, it will\r\neither interfere with the conduct of war proper, or it will be wasted.\r\nIt took us two bitter years to learn this lesson. Political warfare\r\ncannot be waged without direct access to the White House and the\r\nDepartment of State; field operations cannot be conducted unless they\r\nmeet at some common staff point with field command. No one can succeed\r\nin improvising alleged policy and presenting that policy as United\r\nStates policy, and get away with it. Sooner or later actual policy\r\ncatches up with him. In the field, no civilian can write leaflets for\r\nair or ground distribution unless he has some idea of when, where, why,\r\nand how they will be used.\r\n\r\nThe second lesson of World War II, set forth by Colonel Solbert and Dr.\r\nEdwin Guthrie was simply this: _Atrocity propaganda begets atrocity._\r\nEveryone knows that war is cruel, sad, shameful to the soul of man;\r\neveryone knows that it hurts, degrades, injures the human body; everyone\r\nknows that it is not pleasant to undergo, nor even to look at. If any\r\nparticular war is worth fighting, it is worth fighting for some reason\r\nother than the crazily obvious one--the fact that it is already war. It\r\nis a poor statesman or general who cannot give his troops and people an\r\ninspiring statement of their own side in war. Atrocity propaganda reacts\r\nagainst war in general; meanwhile, it goads the enemy into committing\r\nmore atrocities. The anti-atrocity rule was not lifted in World War II\r\n(save for one or two notable exceptions, such as President Roosevelt's\r\ndelayed announcement of the Japanese having executed the Doolittle\r\nflyers) except for the specific purpose of preventing some atrocity that\r\nseemed about to occur in a known situation from actually occurring.\r\nAtrocity propaganda heats up the imagination of troops, makes them more\r\nliable to nervous or psychoneurotic strain. It increases the chances of\r\none's own side committing atrocities in revenge for the ones alleged or\r\nreported. Furthermore, atrocity propaganda scares the enemy out of\r\nsurrendering, and gives the enemy command an easier responsibility in\r\npersuading their troops to fight with last-ditch desperation.\r\n\r\nThe third lesson was equally simple: _America does not normally produce\r\npsychological warfare personnel in peacetime, and if such personnel are\r\nto be needed again, they will have to be trained especially and in\r\nadvance._\r\n\r\n\r\n=Qualifications for Psychological Warfare.= Effective psychological\r\nwarfare requires the combination of four skills in a single individual:\r\n\r\n  (1) An effective working knowledge of U.S. government administration\r\n  and policy, so that the purposes and plans of the government may be\r\n  correctly interpreted.\r\n\r\n  (2) An effective knowledge of correct military and naval procedure and\r\n  of staff operations, together with enough understanding of the arts of\r\n  warfare, whether naval or military, to adjust propaganda utterance to\r\n  military situations and to practical propaganda operations in forms\r\n  which will dovetail.\r\n\r\n  (3) Professional knowledge of the media of information, or of at\r\n  least one of them (book-publishing, magazines, newspapers, radio,\r\n  advertising in its various branches), or of some closely related field\r\n  (practical political canvassing, visual or adult education, etc.).\r\n\r\n  (4) Intimate, professional-level understanding of a given area (Italy,\r\n  Japan, New Guinea, Kwangtung, Algeria), based on first-hand\r\n  acquaintance, knowledge of the language, traditions, history,\r\n  practical politics, and customs.\r\n\r\nOn top of these, there may be a possible fifth skill to make the\r\nindividual perfect:\r\n\r\n  (5) Professional scientific understanding of psychology, anthropology,\r\n  sociology, history, political science, or a comparable field.\r\n\r\nThe man who steps up and says that he meets all five of these\r\nqualifications is a liar, a genius, or both.\r\n\r\nThere is no perfect psychological warrior.\r\n\r\nHowever--and the qualification is important--each psychological warfare\r\nteam represents a composite of these skills. Some members have two or\r\nthree to start with, the others virtually none. But all of the\r\npersonnel, except for men with peculiarly specialized jobs (ordnance\r\nexperts; cryptographers; translators; calligraphers), end up with a\r\nprofessionalism that blends these together. They may not meet\r\nprofessional standards as\r\nofficials-officers-journalists-Japanologists-psychoanalysts when they\r\nreturn from psychological warfare operations against the Japanese, but\r\nthey have met men who are one or more of these, and have picked up the\r\nrudiments of each skill--enough, at least, to suspect what they do not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nThe advertising man or newspaperman (skill 3) who goes into\r\npsychological warfare must learn something of the enemy, neutral or\r\nfriendly groups whom he addresses (skill 4), something of United States\r\ncivilian government procedures (skill 1), something of military or naval\r\norganization and operations (skill 2) and ideally something of\r\npsychology or sociology or economics, depending on the topic of his work\r\n(skill 5).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 19: Propaganda Against Propaganda._ As an\r\noccasional stunt, propaganda is directed against propaganda. Hitler did\r\nso in his book, _Mein Kampf_. The leaflet, shown in the original and in\r\nfacsimile, was used by the Allies on the Germans in the West. A German\r\nleaflet, addressed to their own troops (\"defensive propaganda\"), was\r\npicked up, X'd out, copied, and refuted.]\r\n\r\nThe psychological soldier deals with enemy troops in their _civilian_\r\ncapacity; he addresses them as _men_, he appeals to their non-military\r\ncharacteristics in most instances, and he does not follow sportsmanship,\r\nas men did in other wars, by helping the enemy command maintain\r\ndiscipline. Furthermore, the soldier works with writers, illustrators,\r\ntranslators, script-writers, announcers and others whose skills are\r\nprimarily civilian, and he takes his policy cues from the civilian\r\nauthority at the top of the war effort. An infantry colonel does not\r\nhave to worry about what the Secretary of State is saying, if the\r\ncolonel is on the field of battle. But an officer detailed to\r\npsychological warfare must remain attuned to civilian life even if he\r\nhas seen no one out of khaki for two months straight.\r\n\r\nPersonnel was probably the biggest field problem of the entire war.\r\nShould psychological warfare be needed again, it will take careful\r\nculling of personnel to obtain the necessary staff and operators. The\r\ncontinuation of psychological warfare techniques, in part at least, by\r\nboth civilian and military agencies in time of peace will, it may be\r\nhoped, provide the U.S. with a cadre for the next time. Very little of\r\nthe living experience of the Creel Committee was carried over into OWI.\r\nWalter Lippmann, who had worked with both Creel and Blankenhorn, was not\r\na participant. Carl Crow, the advertising man and writer from Shanghai,\r\nworked on China for the Creel Committee in World War I and on China\r\nagain for OWI in World War II. He was exceptional, and took no major\r\npart in setting up indoctrination. One of the OWI executives in 1946,\r\nshortly after his return to civilian life, read James Mock and Cedric\r\nLarson's account of the Creel Committee, _Words That Won the War_\r\n(Princeton, 1939); his interest was avid. When he finished, he said,\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord, those people made the same mistakes we made!\"\r\n\r\nHe had forgotten that the Creel Committee record had been available all\r\nthe way through.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Effects of American Operations.= The net effects of the work of\r\ncivilian-operated propaganda are hard to appraise because the radio\r\nbroadcasts and leaflets for civilians were designed to have a long-range\r\neffect on the enemy. Statistical computations come to nothing. It would\r\nappear likely that some parts of our psychological warfare actually\r\nlengthened the war and made it more difficult to win. The \"unconditional\r\nsurrender\" formula, the publicity given to proposals for the\r\npastoralization of Germany, the emphasis on Japanese savagery with its\r\nimplied threat of counter-savagery were not overlooked by the enemy\r\nauthorities. It is certain that other parts of our psychological warfare\r\nspeeded up the end of the war, saved lives, increased the war effort\r\nwhich was enormous when measured in terms of the expenditure of\r\nmanpower, matériel and time involved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 20: Re-Use of Enemy Propaganda._ Leaflets\r\nsometimes develop an enemy pictorial or slogan theme and use it\r\neffectively against the original disseminators. Employing the colors and\r\ninsignia of the U.S. Air Force, this Nazi leaflet for Frenchmen makes no\r\nattempt to minimize American bombing to the French. Instead, it uses the\r\nAllied heading, \"The hour of liberation will ring....\" Then it adds the\r\ngrim point, \"Make your will, make your will.\"]\r\n\r\nOne operation alone probably repaid the entire cost of OWI throughout\r\nthe war. The Japanese offered to surrender, but with conditions. We\r\nresponded, rejecting the conditions. The Japanese government pondered\r\nits reply, but while it pondered, B-29s carried leaflets to all parts of\r\nJapan, giving the text of the Japanese official offer to surrender. This\r\nact alone would have made it almost impossibly difficult for the\r\nJapanese government to whip its people back into frenzy for suicidal\r\nprolongation of war. The Japanese texts were checked between Washington\r\nand Hawaii by radiophotograph and cryptotelephone; the plates were put\r\ninto the presses at Saipan; the big planes took off, leaflets properly\r\nloaded in the right kind of leaflet bombs. It took Americans three and a\r\nhalf years to reach that point, but we reached it. Nowhere else in\r\nhistory can there be found an instance of so many people being given so\r\ndecisive a message, all at the same time, at the very dead-point between\r\nwar and peace.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese had done their best against us, but their best was not\r\nenough. We got in the last word, and made sure it was the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Soviet Experience.= Soviet psychological warfare used Communist party\r\nfacilities during World War II, turning them on and off as needed. But\r\nSoviet psychological war efforts were not characterized by blind\r\nreliance on past experience. They showed a very real inventiveness, and\r\nthe political policies behind them were both far-sighted and\r\nfar-reaching.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet government was the one government in the world which could be\r\neven more totalitarian than Nazi Germany. Many Americans may consider\r\nthis a moral disadvantage, but in psychological warfare it has very\r\nheavy compensating advantages. The Soviet people were propaganda-conscious\r\nto an intense degree, but the authorities took no chances. Revolutionary\r\nCommunist themes were brilliantly intermingled with patriotic Russian\r\nitems. Army officers were given extraordinary privileges. Everyone was\r\ngiven epaulettes. The Communist revolutionary song, the famous\r\n_Internationale_, was discarded in favor of a new Soviet hymn. History\r\nwas rewritten. The Czars were honored again. The Church was asked to\r\npray for victory. The Soviet officials were able to tailor their social\r\nsystem to fit the propaganda. They did so, even to the name of the war.\r\nThey call it the Great Patriotic War. Outsiders may murmur, \"What war\r\nis not?\" But the Russian people liked it, and the regime used\r\ntraditionalism and nationalism to cinch Communism in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nIn their combat propaganda the Russians were equally ruthless and\r\nrealistic. They appealed to the memory of Frederick the Great of\r\nPrussia, they reminded the Germans of Bismarck's warning not to commit\r\ntheir forces in the East, they appealed to the German Junker caste\r\nagainst the unprofessional Nazi scum who were ruining the German army,\r\nand they used every propaganda trick that had ever been heard of. They\r\nturned prisoners into a real military asset by employing them in\r\npropaganda, and talked a whole staff of Nazi generals into the Free\r\nGermany movement.\r\n\r\nOnly in radio did the Russians retain some of their old revolutionary\r\nfire with its irritating qualities for non-Communist peoples. This was\r\nexplicable in terms of the audience. The Russians could keep their\r\ndomestic propaganda half-secret by imposing a censorship ban on those\r\nparts of it, or those comments on it, which they did not wish known to\r\nCommunists abroad. The censorship was a permanent institution, in war\r\nand out, and therefore did not impose special difficulty. They could\r\nkeep their front-line propaganda quiet, since they did not allow their\r\nAllies to send military observers up front, and the Nazis could be\r\ncounted on not to tell the world about effective anti-Nazi propaganda.\r\nBut their radio propaganda had to be audible to everyone. Hence the\r\nradio propaganda was the least ingenious in using reactionary themes\r\neffectively. The Russians and Germans both used black radio, but since\r\neach policed the home audience rigorously against the other, it is\r\npossible that the efforts cancelled out.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Japanese Developments.= The Japanese invented little in psychological\r\nwarfare. They made excellent and judicious use of news to the American\r\naudience. They actually got much more official Japanese news into the\r\nAmerican press during the war years than they had succeeded in placing\r\nduring peacetime, when they had offices in American cities. They did so\r\nby maintaining the regular Domei news service in English-language Morse\r\nwireless for the American press, ready-edited for the newspaper offices.\r\nThey put by-lines on the stories and it is said they sometimes even told\r\nthe American newspapers: \"Please hold until nine AM Eastern War Time.\r\nThank You. Domei.\" In dealing with Asiatic audiences, special Japanese\r\n_butai_ did a great deal of black propaganda along with subversive\r\noperations, but they displayed little initiative as to the use of basic\r\ntechniques. Their chief merits were industry, patience, and the delivery\r\nof a first-class news service.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chinese Uses.= The Chinese Communist forces broke all records for\r\ncertain specialized aspects of combat propaganda. Japanese prisoners\r\nwere given cordial welcome, better food than they had in the Army, the\r\ncompany of maidens, rich gifts, and political indoctrination about the\r\nfreedom of Japan. These soldiers then went with the Chinese Communists\r\nback to the front lines and talked Japanese sentries out of their\r\nstrong-points. The Yenan forces went to great pains with this\r\npropaganda, and even \"elected\" a Japanese prisoner to the City Council\r\nof Yenan. The author talked with the Political Director of the Chinese\r\nCommunist authority at Yenan, and with some of the Japanese in Communist\r\nChina. There was evidence of a real understanding of the problems of the\r\nJapanese common soldier, and of real sympathy with him, which the\r\nJapanese enlisted men were quick to feel. The Communists went so far as\r\nto throw gift packages into the Japanese lines--not booby-traps, just\r\nnice gifts with the polite request for a reply. They learned the names\r\nof Japanese field telephone operators, and then spliced into the line\r\nand argued politics with them in a rough and jolly way. When they had\r\nenough prisoners they kept the most promising converts for political\r\ntraining. They fed the ordinary prisoners well, entertained them\r\nroyally, and sent them back to their own lines with the suggestion that\r\nthe Chinese Communists would appreciate it if their good Japanese\r\nbrethren would in combat please shoot their rifles in the air, thus\r\nmaking sure of not hitting Communists while at the same time avoiding\r\nunnecessary trouble with the Japanese officers.\r\n\r\nUnder \"Chiang the Chairman,\" the Chinese national government waged a\r\ndignified, humane kind of psychological warfare against Japan. Few\r\npeople remember an odd chapter out of modern history, the Chinese\r\nbombardment of Nagasaki, although it is possible that Asiatic historians\r\nof the future will make a substantial contrast between the Chinese who\r\nstruck the first blow at that city and the Americans who struck the\r\nlast. Shortly after the outbreak of the full quasi-war between China and\r\nJapan in 1937, the Generalissimo ordered his bombers to attack Japan.\r\nAmerican-built Chinese bombers appeared over Kyushu, the first invaders\r\nto show up since the shoguns repelled Kublai Khan 656 years earlier. But\r\ninstead of dropping bombs, they dropped leaflets denouncing aggression\r\nand inferentially pointing out that while the Japanese were uncivilized\r\nenough to bomb their fellow-Asiatics, the Chinese were too civilized to\r\nundertake reprisals in kind.\r\n\r\nThe Generalissimo's troops also had fraternization and front-line\r\npropaganda, but not to the extent to which the Chinese Communists did.\r\nThe Generalissimo himself followed a very liberal (not in the Leftist\r\nbut the true sense) political line toward Japan. He uttered no threat\r\nof vengeance. He was the first leader of a great nation to say that the\r\nJapanese Emperor question was to be settled by letting the Japanese\r\nthemselves choose their own form of government after the war was all\r\nover. He had Japanese on his political staffs--democratic persons whom\r\nhis officials encouraged--and regular Japanese broadcasts were kept up\r\nthroughout the war on the Chungking radio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\nANALYSIS, INTELLIGENCE, AND ESTIMATE OF THE SITUATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7\r\n\r\nPropaganda Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion analysis pertains to what people think; propaganda analysis\r\ndeals with what somebody is trying to make them think. Each form of\r\nanalysis is a new and flourishing field in civilian social research; the\r\nbibliographies of Smith, Lasswell and Casey, and the current reviews in\r\nthe _Public Opinion Quarterly_[29] demonstrate the existence of a large\r\nand growing literature on the subject. Each year, new textbooks in the\r\nfield or current revisions of old ones can be counted on to bring\r\nscholastic and scientific findings up to date.\r\n\r\nTechnical writings on visual education, religious conversion, labor\r\norganization, practical politics, revolutionary agitation, and on\r\ncommercial advertising have frequent bearing on propaganda analysis.\r\n\r\nPropaganda cannot be analyzed in a logical vacuum. Every step in the\r\noperation is intensely practical. There is nothing timeless about it,\r\nother than that common sense which is based on the nature of man. The\r\nancient Chinese three-character classic, from which several billion\r\nChinese have tried to learn to read, says:\r\n\r\n    _Jên chih ch'u\r\n    Hsing pên shan;\r\n    Hsing hsiang chin,\r\n    Hsi hsiang yüan._\r\n\r\nFreely translated, this means, \"When people are born, they all start\r\n_good_, but even though they all start out about the same, you ought to\r\nsee them after they have had time to become different from one another\r\nby picking up habits here and there!\"[30] The common nature of man may\r\nbe at the basis of all propaganda and politics, but incentives to action\r\nare found in the stimuli of varied everyday environments. Certain very\r\nelementary appeals can be made _almost_ without reference to the\r\npersonal everyday background (\"cultural-historical milieu\") of the\r\nperson addressed. Yet in a matter as simple as staying alive or not\r\nstaying alive--in which it might be supposed that all human beings would\r\nhave the same basic response--the difference between Japanese and\r\nAmericans was found to be basic when it came to surrender. To Japanese\r\nsoldiers, the verbal distinction between _surrender_ and _cease\r\nhonorable resistance_ was as important as the difference between life\r\nand death. The Japanese would not survive at the cost of their honor,\r\nbut if their honor were satisfied, they willingly gave up.\r\n\r\nPropaganda is directed to the subtle niceties of thought by which people\r\nmaintain their personal orientation in an unstable interpersonal world.\r\nPropaganda must use the language of the mother, the schoolteacher, the\r\nlover, the bully, the policeman, the actor, the ecclesiastic, the buddy,\r\nthe newspaperman, all of them in turn. And propaganda analysis, in\r\nweighing and evaluating propaganda, must be even more discriminating in\r\ndetermining whether the propaganda is apt to hit its mark or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Monitoring.= The first requisite of propaganda analysis is materials to\r\nbe analyzed. In time of peace, it is usually enough to send a\r\nsubscription to the newspaper, magazine, or pamphlet series, and to buy\r\nthe books as they come out. Poster propaganda is more difficult to\r\nobtain, and frequently requires on-the-spot contacts. Dr. David Rowe\r\nbrought back from Occupied China, in the early days of the Sino-Japanese\r\nwar, a spectacularly well done and interesting series of Japanese and\r\nquisling posters. They were not hard to come by, once he was there, but\r\nhe had to go about twenty thousand miles to get them and return.\r\n\r\nIn obtaining printed propaganda, better results will be achieved if the\r\nsame sources are followed consistently over a period of time than if one\r\ntriumphant raid is carried through. The choice may look like this (_see\r\nChart III_). If, in this instance the propaganda analysis is to be a\r\none-man enterprise in a small country or area in time of peace, the one\r\nman can collect all the different kinds of samples in March and can then\r\nspend several months trying to see how they add up. By the time his\r\nanalysis is ready, it will be badly dated and will necessarily be less\r\ninteresting to the recipients than would a report which was\r\nup-to-the-week. Furthermore, unless the analyst knows the area very well\r\nindeed, he will risk mistaking transient issues for basic ones. If the\r\nOld Agrarians happen to be accused of Right Wing Deviationism during the\r\nweek of 3-10 March, the analyst may falsely conclude that the Old\r\nAgrarian issue is tempestuous or profound.\r\n\r\nUnless he has a large staff, faces a special crisis or pursues a\r\nscholarly purpose, the analyst does well to pick the alternative\r\nillustrated in the vertical column. He should pick his media carefully,\r\naccepting the advice of people who know the area intimately. In an\r\nopinion-controlled area, it is wise to take both a direct government\r\npropaganda paper and an opposition of semi-independent paper, if such\r\nexist. Local papers are often better guides to domestic propaganda than\r\nare big metropolitan papers. The propagandists of the country know that\r\nforeigners may watch the big papers, and they will reserve their most\r\nvicious, naïve, or bigoted appeals for the local press.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chart III._\r\n\r\n  JANUARY                                           I\r\n  FEBRUARY                                     H    I\r\n  MARCH          B    C    D    E         G    H    I   J    K    L\r\n  APRIL     A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H    I   J    K    L\r\n  MAY       A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H    I   J    K    L\r\n  JUNE           B    C    D    E         G    H    I   J    K    L\r\n  JULY                                         H    I   J\r\n  AUGUST                                            I\r\n\r\n  Key to Chart:\r\n\r\n  A POSTERS\r\n  B ADVERTISEMENTS\r\n  C CITY DAILY PAPERS\r\n  D LOCAL DAILY PAPERS\r\n  E WEEKLY PAPERS\r\n  F MAGAZINES\r\n  G SPECIAL JOURNALS\r\n  H GOVERNMENT RELEASES\r\n  I MOTION PICTURE ANNOUNCEMENTS\r\n  J REPORTS OF SPEECHES\r\n  K RADIO PROGRAMS\r\n  L OTHER MEDIA\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nAlong with the local press of one or two selected localities, the\r\nanalyst should select several government personages and should follow\r\nevery word of theirs he can find. The basic principle is for the analyst\r\nhimself to determine the range of materials to be covered by deciding\r\nhis own work-load in advance. This in turn depends on the time he has\r\navailable for the task, his mastery of the language, his interest in the\r\nprojects, probable interruptions due to semiofficial elbow-bending, and\r\nother personal factors.\r\n\r\nThe rule remains: _Consistent analysis of the same output with reference\r\nto basic topics over a sustained period will inevitably reveal the\r\npropaganda intention of the source._ (It must be pointed out that the\r\nexpert analyst still is needed to select topics and to confirm\r\ninterpretations.) To make a first guess as to whether the intended\r\neffect is being achieved or not, the analyst uses himself as a\r\npropaganda guinea pig. What does he think of the issues? What might he\r\nhave thought otherwise? What would he think if he were a little less\r\nintelligent, a little more uncritical, than he is? And to complete the\r\nanalysis, the analyst must go out to the audience that receives the\r\nmaterials and find out what effect the propaganda has had by asking them\r\nabout it (see interrogation, page 145).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Printed Materials.= The most readily available sources of propaganda\r\nare not printed ones. Especially in time of hostilities, it may not be\r\neasy to subscribe to enemy materials by the process of sending an\r\ninternational postal money order. Delays involved in transmitting the\r\nprinted materials may make them useless for spot analysis, and valuable\r\nonly for long-range basic studies of morale. The propagandist who is\r\nbeing analyzed may oblige by reading large numbers of editorials on the\r\nradio. (During the last war, officers and citizens occasionally exploded\r\nwith alarm when Radio Tokyo quoted a _Life_ or New York _Times_\r\neditorial several hours after it appeared. They naturally supposed that\r\nthe Japanese had a secret short-wave transmitter running from New York\r\nCity direct to Tokyo, and overlooked the fact that the OWI may have\r\nquoted long excerpts in slow Morse code on its trans-Pacific beam to\r\nChina. The Japanese had picked it up, used subquotes, and beamed it\r\nback.)\r\n\r\nPrinted matter goes on the air in any major news operation. It is only a\r\nmatter of time before telephoto facilities develop in line with the\r\nexperimental New York _Times_ edition printed in San Francisco during\r\nthe United Nations organizational conference. This was sent, all in one\r\npiece, by wirephoto to Frisco and reprinted. The delay between the two\r\neditions was merely a matter of minutes. In the future, wireless\r\ntelephoto may reduce this to seconds, so that all belligerents can\r\nsimply tune in on each other's major newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Radio.= For the present radio remains the biggest source of propaganda\r\nintake. Radio is convenient. It can be picked up illegitimately without\r\ntoo much fear of detection. For the cost per person reached, it is\r\ncertainly the cheapest way of getting material to millions of people\r\npromptly. It lends itself to monitoring, and even standard (long)\r\nwavelengths can be picked up from surprisingly great distances.\r\n\r\nThe only defense against enemy use of radio monitoring or broadcasting\r\nconsists of the application of wired radio--which means plugging all the\r\nradio sets in on the telephone circuit, putting nothing on the air, and\r\ndefying the enemy to eavesdrop. If the radio sets are then policed, and\r\nare made incapable of receiving wireless material, that particular\r\naudience is effectively cut off from the enemy. (When the Red Army, with\r\nits acute propaganda-conscious security, moved into many Eastern\r\nEuropean cities, the first thing it did was to round up all the radios\r\nwhich the Nazis had overlooked. This prevented the liberated peoples\r\nfrom being enslaved by the \"filthy reactionary lies\" of the American and\r\nBritish governments, and made sure that the peoples would stay\r\nliberated under influence of their local Soviet-controlled newspapers.)\r\n\r\nWired radio is expensive. Radio suppression is difficult; the successful\r\nconcealers of radio receivers become two-legged newspapers and go around\r\ntown spreading all the hot dope which the authorities are trying to\r\nsuppress. Scarcity puts a premium on such news; rumor then becomes\r\nunmanageable. Except for strangely drastic situations, it is probable\r\nthat the great powers will continue to tolerate radio reception even\r\nthough it may mean letting foreign subversive propaganda slip in now and\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore likely that radio broadcasts will be available for\r\nmonitoring for the pre-belligerent stages of the next war, should war\r\ncome again in our time, and that radio may last through a great part or\r\nall of the duration of the war. Factors which cannot now be foreseen,\r\nsuch as radio control of weapons, will affect this.\r\n\r\nRadio propaganda analysis follows the same considerations as those which\r\ngovern choice of materials for analyzing printed matter. It is a surer\r\nmethod to follow one or two programs on a station than to make wide\r\nrandom selections. A standard-wave transmitter to the home audience\r\ncomes closer to revealing the domestic scene than would a global\r\nrebroadcast of ostensibly identical material. Radio has a further\r\nadvantage over print. Few nations print out separate propaganda for each\r\nforeign-language area, while almost every large and medium-sized country\r\nhas international facilities for broadcast. Since the programs are\r\nbeamed to different language groups, the senders automatically make up\r\npropaganda lines for each audience.[31]\r\n\r\nAttentive monitoring can provide material for distinguishing the various\r\nlines which any given nation is sending out to its friends, neighbors,\r\nor rivals. Frequently the differences between these lines make good\r\ncounterpropaganda. If you hear the Germans telling the Danes that all\r\nNordics are supermen and all non-Nordics scum, while telling the\r\nJapanese that the National Socialist idea of the world transcends\r\npluto-democratic race prejudice, put the two quotations together and\r\nsend them back to the Danes and the Japanese both.\r\n\r\nRadio, unlike print, cannot be held for the analyst's convenience. It is\r\nphysically unhandy to try to file actual recordings of enemy broadcasts\r\nfor preservation and reference. When the analysis center is large, as it\r\nwould be if near the headquarters of a government or a theater of war,\r\nthe difficulties of monitoring involve problems of stenographic and\r\nlanguage help. The monitors themselves can then be stenographers, taking\r\nverbatim dictation. They write down the enemy broadcast word-for-word,\r\neither right off the air or from records. The editor then selects the\r\nmost important parts of the day's intake for mimeographic or other\r\ncirculation. Important material can be put in a daily radio summary of\r\nenemy propaganda for the area monitored. The rest of it can be sent\r\nalong by mail, put in files and classified (lest the enemy government\r\nfind out what its own propagandists really were saying), preserved on\r\nthe recording, or destroyed.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II these basic verbatim reports played a very important\r\npart. The Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service did the job for the\r\nUnited States, operating through the war years under the Federal\r\nCommunications Commission. It has since been shifted from FCC to the War\r\nDepartment, and from the War Department to the Central Intelligence\r\nGroup. Its materials sometimes are unclassified, although during most of\r\nthe war they were marked _restricted_, and they are not available to the\r\npublic except through microfilm copies of the Library of Congress file.\r\nThese FBIS daily reports skimmed the cream off the enemy news\r\nbroadcasts, and included editorial or feature material which might have\r\nintelligence or policy interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Monitoring by a Single Individual.= Where monitoring must be done by a\r\nsingle individual or a very small staff, it is desirable to find a basic\r\nnews broadcast and to take it down verbatim where possible. This gives\r\nthe analyst the chance of a second look at his materials and keeps him\r\nfrom having to make snap judgments of what is important and what is not,\r\nright during the course of the broadcast. Selection of a basic news\r\nprogram, followed by reference to speeches, plays, lectures and other\r\nprograms that indicate the over-all tone of the day's output, will make\r\nit possible for one person to do an adequate monitoring job on about\r\none-eighth of his full-time work per station. This does not leave him\r\ntime to do much fancy analysis, or to prepare graphs, but he can pass\r\nalong the general psychological warfare situation so far as that\r\nparticular beam on that particular transmitter is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe most likely situation for the isolated consul, businessman, officer,\r\nmissionary, or amateur is one in which he can get a certain amount of\r\nstenographic help in taking down the broadcast material. The radio for\r\nmonitoring varies in accordance with general reception conditions.\r\nPractically all the U. S. Army Signal Corps receivers will perform\r\nsatisfactorily for local monitoring; so too will ordinary private sets,\r\nincluding the larger portables. An automobile radio can often be driven\r\naway from interference and from a hilltop or the edge of a lake can pick\r\nup a standard-wave station that cannot be distinguished on a much larger\r\nhouse set in the city. For transoceanic or world-wide reception, a\r\nshort-wave receiver is of course necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is unwise to pick a sample that involves too much rapid speech, such\r\nas a foreign soap opera. The best reception is almost always the Morse\r\ncode transmission of news or the slow dictation-speed reading of news\r\nfrom one central station to outlying news offices or substations.\r\nSelection of a program which usually comes in, arrangement for a\r\nverbatim copy of the program, daily checking of the news under standard\r\nanalysis procedures--this gives a very fair cross-section.\r\n\r\nOne man sitting at Hankow could find out just what both the\r\nGeneralissimo and the Chinese Communists were trying to tell the\r\nFrench-understanding and the Dutch-understanding listeners in the Far\r\nEast. Another with pipe and slippers in Brussels could keep tab on the\r\nbasic Russian lines to the Spanish-speaking world. Such monitoring\r\nobviously comes in handy for newspapers, commercial firms, governments,\r\nmilitary establishments, speculators, and research institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Identification: Propaganda vs. Truth.= The point will invariably arise:\r\n\"This tells me how to listen to a foreign radio. Okay, I'll get the\r\nnews, the lectures, the plays--all the rest of it. But so what? How am I\r\ngoing to know what's the truth and what's propaganda? How can I tell 'em\r\napart? Tell me that!\"\r\n\r\nThe answer is simple: \"If you agree with it, it's truth. If you don't\r\nagree, it's propaganda. Pretend that it is all propaganda. See what\r\nhappens on your analysis reports.\"\r\n\r\nPropaganda was defined (at the beginning of this book) as follows:\r\n_Propaganda consists of the planned use of any form of communication\r\ndesigned to affect the minds and emotions of a given group for a\r\nspecific purpose._ Taking a lesson from Communist theory, we can say\r\nthat any form of mass-communication is operated for propaganda purposes\r\n_if no other motive for running it is evident_. Human beings talk; they\r\nlike to talk. Much private talk is idle--but only an imbecile would talk\r\nover a radio network just for the pleasure of hearing himself talking.\r\nPropaganda is presentation for a purpose; it is the _purpose_ that makes\r\nit propaganda, and not the truthfulness or untruthfulness of it.\r\n\r\nThe collected news of any modern country contains more truth each day\r\nthan any one man can could read in a lifetime. The reporters, editors,\r\nwriters, announcers who collect truth not only collect it; they select\r\nit. They have to. Why do they select it? That is the propaganda\r\nquestion. If they select it to \"affect the minds and emotions of a given\r\ngroup for a specific purpose,\" it is propaganda. If they report that a\r\nlittle girl fell out of bed and broke her neck--with the intent of\r\nfrightening parents among their listeners into following the Safe Homes\r\nWeek Campaign--that is propaganda. But if they report it because it is\r\nthe only death in the community, and because they might as well fill up\r\nthe program, it is not propaganda. If you put the statement on the air,\r\n\"An American negro workman in Greensboro, N. C., got eighty cents for a\r\nhard day's work last week,\" that can be presented and interpreted as:\r\n\r\n  (a.) simple news, if there is something more to the story, about what\r\n  the man said, or how he spent the eighty cents on corn meal to feed\r\n  his pet tarantula;\r\n\r\n  (b.) anti-capitalist propaganda, if you show that eighty cents is\r\n  mighty little money for American business to pay its workers;\r\n\r\n  (c.) pro-capitalist propaganda, if you show that the eighty cents will\r\n  buy more than two weeks' wages of a worker in the city of Riga, when\r\n  it comes to consumer goods;\r\n\r\n  (d.) anti-White propaganda, if you show the man got only eighty cents\r\n  because he was a Negro.\r\n\r\nAnd so on, through a further variety of interpretations. The facts--man,\r\nhappening, amount, place, time--are _true_ in each case. They could be\r\nsworn to by the whole membership of an interfaith conference. But the\r\ninterpretation placed on them--who communicates these facts to whom?\r\nwhy? when?--makes them into propaganda.\r\n\r\nAnd interpretation can no more be true or untrue than a Ford car can be\r\nvanilla or strawberry in flavor. The questions of truth and of\r\ninterpretation are unrelated categories. The essence of motive is that\r\nit is ultimately private and impenetrable, and interpretation commonly\r\ninvolves imputation of motive. You can dislike an interpretation; you\r\ncan kill a man for believing it; you can propagandize him out of\r\nbelieving it; but you cannot sit down and _prove_ that it is untrue.\r\nFacts and logic are useful in propaganda, but they cannot be elevated to\r\nthe point where you can say, \"Is it propaganda or is it true?\" Almost\r\nall good propaganda--no matter what kind--is true. It uses truth\r\nselectively.\r\n\r\nThere is no secret formula which, once applied, provides an unfailing\r\ntest for propaganda. It is not possible for a person unfamiliar with the\r\npart of the world affected, with the topic discussed, with the\r\ninterested parties, and with the immediate politics involved to put his\r\nfinger on an item and say, \"This Rightist charge is propaganda,\" and\r\nthen to turn and say, \"But that Rightist statement is not propaganda. It\r\nis fact.\" Untruthful statements are made at times for other than\r\npropaganda purposes; truthful statements may be propaganda or not. The\r\nanalyst must himself be an interested party. He must determine ahead of\r\ntime what he will regard as propaganda, and what not. And he must do so\r\nby delimiting the field of his analysis before he starts. No one person\r\nor staff of people could ever trace all the motives behind a single\r\nstatement; even to attempt that, he would have to be a novelist of the\r\nschool of Marcel Proust. (And he would end up feeling like James Joyce,\r\nGertrude Stein, or Franz Kafka.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 21: Mockery of Enemy Propaganda Slogans._\r\nHome-front propaganda was sometimes repeated in an inappropriate place,\r\nin order to achieve an effect contrary to that originally intended.\r\nThese Nazi leaflets, dropped on American detachments in Europe, used\r\nmodifications of the \"It's Your Job!\" posters and advertisements used by\r\nthe U.S. for home-front purposes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 22: Mockery of Enemy Propaganda Technique._ When\r\nthe content of enemy propaganda cannot be attacked, the media themselves\r\ncan sometimes be criticized. This German leaflet attempted utilization\r\nof potential suspicions of Hollywood. In so doing, it used three\r\ntechniques: built up from a news item, suitably faked; raised suspicion\r\nof the movies which the Germans knew our Army showed for morale\r\npurposes; and spread racial hate.]\r\n\r\nThe analyst looks in the direction in which the message is going. He\r\ndefines the _propaganda presentation_ of the people who get the message\r\nin terms of _all the public information to which the persons addressed\r\nhave access_. If he does not know the purpose of the message, he may\r\ndivine it from the character of the audience and from the effect he\r\npresumes the message may reasonably be expected to have upon the\r\naudience. If he does not know the audience, he can at least follow the\r\nphysical transit of the message. In what language does it move? Whence?\r\nWhither? When?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 23: Direct Reply leaflet._ World War II\r\npropagandists often succumbed to the temptation of using the enemy\r\nmaterials and sending them right back. Sarcasm can be effective if the\r\nreader identifies himself with the speaker and not with the addressee.\r\nIn this Nazi leaflet from the Anzio beachhead, the Germans probably\r\nantagonized more Americans than they befriended. A simple statement of\r\nthe news would have been more effective. (Signal Corps photo.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Stasm Formula.= The formula given earlier (page 44) was found\r\nuseful in the spot analysis of German broadcasts, both open and\r\nclandestine, and Japanese materials, during the last months of the war.\r\nThe formula reads:\r\n\r\n  =S=ource (including Media)\r\n  =T=ime\r\n  =A=udience\r\n  =S=ubject\r\n  =M=ission\r\n\r\nThe neologism, _Stasm_, may serve a mnemonic purpose.\r\n\r\nThe formula works best in the treatment of monitored materials of which\r\nthe source is known. First point to note is the character of the source.\r\nThere are several choices on this: the true source (who really got it\r\nout?) and the ostensible source (whose name is signed to it?); also, the\r\nfirst-use source (who used it the first time?) and the second-use source\r\n(who claims merely to be using it as a quotation?). Take the statement:\r\n\"Harry said to me, he said, 'I never told anybody that Al's wife was a\r\nretired strip-teaser.' Mind you, I don't pretend to believe Harry, but\r\nthat's what he said, all right.\" What are the possible true sources for\r\nthe statement of fact or libel concerning Al's unnamed wife? What are\r\nthe alternatives on ostensible sources? First use? Second use? The\r\ncommon sense needed to analyze this statement is of the same order as\r\nthe process involved in analyzing the statement: \"Reliable sources in\r\nParis state that the visit of the American labor delegation has produced\r\nsensational repercussions in Moscow, and that Moscow, upon the basis of\r\nthe American attitude, is determined to press for unification of the\r\nentire German labor movement.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 24: Black Use of Enemy Subversive Materials._\r\nThis leaflet, printed in brilliant red, white and blue, was found in the\r\nprintshop of a Nazi military propaganda company overtaken in Lorraine.\r\nIt apparently dates from 1939-40, when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germans\r\nwere at peace, with the result that Communists throughout the world\r\nopposed the \"imperialist war.\" The leaflet may or may not be duplicated\r\nfrom a French Communist original; the important thing is its reuse by\r\nthe Germans. This constitutes black propaganda in one of its purest\r\nforms.]\r\n\r\nIt is soon evident that the mere attribution of source is a job of high\r\nmagnitude. A systematic breakdown of the STASM formula produces the\r\nfollowing analysis outline, applicable to any single propaganda item,\r\ncivil or military, in war or peace, spoken, visual, or printed. There\r\nare many other possible arrangements; the one given below is not\r\nrepresented as having official sanction or mysterious powers of its own.\r\nIt has simply worked well for the author.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 25-A: Black Use of Enemy Information Materials._\r\nThe Nazis used this leaflet on the Western Front. The real source was a\r\nGerman propaganda unit; the ostensible source was U.S. Army facilities.\r\nNote that the leaflet has nothing to do with stopping VD among troops,\r\nwhich is what the originals sought; instead, its effect is to depress\r\nAmerican troop morale.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 25-B: Block Use of Enemy Information Materials._\r\nCompare this with the preceding leaflet. The real source in both cases\r\nis enemy. The ostensible source in both cases is the U.S. Army. The\r\nostensible mission in both cases is the prevention of VD. But the\r\nmission is entirely different in the second leaflet. The first was\r\naddressed to troops--Americans--designed to make them feel bad. The\r\nsecond was dropped on civilians--Filipinos--whom the Japanese thus tried\r\nto stir up against the Americans. (Leyte Campaign.

(Philippines, 1944-45.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 27: Malingerer's Black._ One of the favored\r\ntargets of black propaganda is the malingerer. Suspicion of successful\r\nmalingering inevitably hurts the morale of a unit. Even if the enemy's\r\ninstructions are not followed, the troops may suspect genuine\r\npsychoneurotics of having faked their troubles. Almost all participants\r\nin World War II issued such instructions; the Allied samples are not\r\navailable for publication. This is a Japanese leaflet from the\r\nPhilippines, 1944-45.]\r\n\r\nSuch an outline would be useful only if it were applied in common-sense\r\nterms, without turning each item into an elaborate project and thus\r\nlosing the woods in the trees. In most cases, it would suffice to state\r\nthe item briefly for reference and study in the order of the entries.\r\nWhen poorly trained help is available, it is of course necessary to\r\nprint or mimeograph a form to be used.\r\n\r\nIt is as vain to prescribe a propaganda analysis procedure without\r\nknowing the user as to prescribe an office filing system while knowing\r\nneither the nature of the office nor the kind of files kept. In time of\r\nwar, subordinate commanders in operational areas will need to keep files\r\nat a minimum, while rear echelon or national facilities may be able to\r\nkeep files of enormous range and thoroughness. In the recording of a\r\nlarge number of propaganda items, however, the material becomes\r\nhopelessly unmanageable unless there is some standardized system for\r\norganizing it. Mere alphabetization leads inevitably to the question,\r\nalphabetization of what?, and the analysis function can be exercised\r\nmore readily in terms of the _sources_ of propaganda than in terms of\r\nits incidental topics.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Identification of Enemy Plans and Situations.= Propaganda has its\r\ninevitable mirror image which gradually becomes plain to the analyst. If\r\nthe analyst is careful, using shrewd judgment in appraising specific\r\nmissions, he will gradually see forming in his files a record of the\r\nimmediate and long-range aims of the propaganda originators. This\r\nbecomes possible only when enough material is available, over a period\r\nof time to make up a complete list of the probable enemy propaganda\r\nobjectives for the period covered. The intent of propaganda is always a\r\nresult observable as action, however remote the action may be from the\r\ndate of operation. Much of the propaganda of the Communist Party in the\r\nUnited States is directed to the inculcation of correct _scientific_\r\nthinking (see pages 70-74) which will be of decisive use only when the\r\nremote Day of Revolution arrives. Few of the Communist leaders, even in\r\nprivate conference, would venture to predict the exact year of the Day\r\nof Revolution; some may not even expect to see it; but they believe that\r\nif the propaganda is effective, the \"proletariat\" will be \"militant\" and\r\nits leaders will be conscious of their \"historic role.\" From the\r\npropaganda of today, the action may be anticipated, no matter how\r\ndistant it may seem; once the action is determined, the relation of\r\nother propaganda items to that action can be traced.\r\n\r\nIn war, the action sought is something militarily harmful to the\r\nenemy--strikes against his production, panic in his population,\r\ncomplaint from his consumers, mistrust from his newspaper readers and\r\nradio listeners (resulting in eventual subversive or negative action on\r\ntheir part), surrender of his troops, disunity of his political\r\nleadership to be expressed in deadlocks, and so on. In pre-belligerent\r\nor peacetime propaganda, the action sought is against the war-making\r\ncapacity of the audience--against war itself, if the propagandist feels\r\nthat his own population is in no immediate danger of being infected by\r\ndefeatism.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Estimating the Enemy's Propaganda Situation.= In addition to presenting\r\na picture of the enemy goals, and of the psychological means he\r\nconsiders to be useful in reaching those goals, propaganda analysis is\r\nalso valuable in presenting the enemy's own propaganda situation. He\r\navoids certain topics because he must. He talks about others because\r\ncircumstances force him to do so.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the Germans stop talking about rations for Jews (in the\r\nWorld War II situation), it may be that their own people, filled with\r\nanti-Semitic poison, have been protesting the issuance of rations.\r\nAlternatively, it may mean that the Nazi authorities have just cancelled\r\nJewish rations and are letting the Jews starve or are murdering them\r\novertly. If the Germans follow this up with an item on the poor barley\r\ncrop, it may be that they are preparing the sentimental and humane\r\nlisteners in their own audience for the announcement of Jewish\r\nstarvation. If they run Paris-quisling accounts of Jewish hoarding, and\r\nof Jews concealing large quantities of food, it means that they are\r\nalmost certain to be under pressure to explain their Jewish policies and\r\nthat, therefore, two factors face the German propagandist: first, he\r\nmust get ready to announce the attack on the Jews; second, he thinks\r\nthat the Jewish situation is going to arouse anti-Nazi sentiment even in\r\nGermany (if these are German-language programs) and he is therefore\r\ncompelled to defend something because public opinion is believed by him\r\nto be against it. Out of a silence (no further news on rations), a\r\ndomestic item (poor barley crop), and a foreign item (Paris Jews\r\nallegedly hoarding), it is possible to reconstruct a whole situation.\r\nThe reconstruction may fall, if other interpretations arise, but it\r\nprovides a starting guess.\r\n\r\nThe situation of enemy morale is often reportable through propaganda\r\nanalysis long before it can be described by eyewitnesses. Omissions of\r\nattacks on the Church may indicate that the religious problem has become\r\ntouchy. Failure to attack Communism may mean that the government is\r\nseeking a diplomatic deal with a Communist state. Mention of children\r\nmay refer to the fact that parents complain of cold schools, bad food,\r\nabsent doctors. Good morale is shown by a quiet tone in propaganda; bad\r\nmorale is shown by extremes, whether of silence or of great vehemence.\r\nIt is useful to know what the enemy propagandist thinks he is doing,\r\nwhat he considers the obstacles to his propaganda. Such considerations\r\ninevitably get to be embodied in the propaganda itself. A tone of\r\nextreme defiance, poor international cooperation, war bluster and so on\r\nmay often spring from the desire to divert a hungry or discontented home\r\npublic from its real worries at home to imaginary worries abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Propanal as a Source of Military Intelligence.= Propaganda analysis, or\r\n_propanal_ for short, can serve as a very useful adjunct to military\r\nintelligence even if when not directly connected with counterpropaganda\r\noperations. In the first place, the enemy must give news, comment,\r\nopinion, entertainment in order to get attention. The incidental content\r\nand make-up of this propaganda is itself useful study material. If his\r\nink is bad, his paper poor, his language incorrect, it shows shortages\r\nof supply and personnel. If he boasts about his victories, he usually\r\ngives his version of place names and aids cartographic reporting. In\r\nmentioning the names of heroes, he may supply order-of-battle. In making\r\na good story out of his economic situation, he fills in missing\r\nstatistics; even if the figures are falsified, they must be falsified\r\nfor a purpose and can be used in conjunction with others in making up an\r\nestimate.\r\n\r\nNothing is as smart as a human being except another human being. What\r\nany one man can try to achieve in the way of deceit, another man can try\r\nto figure out. The bulk of propaganda, short of peremptory tactical\r\nleaflets, is filled with information about the enemy's personnel, his\r\nopinion of himself, his opinion of you, his state of mind, his order of\r\nbattle, his economic system, and all the rest. The Japanese government,\r\nthroughout the war, kept the United States informed _in English_ of the\r\nchanges of ministers and other high officials in the Japanese\r\ngovernment. This gave us good political background. There was no use\r\ntheir trying to hide it over a long period of time, and presumably _Joho\r\nKyoku_ (the Imperial Japanese Board of Information) figured that the\r\nhelp it gave the Americans, in filling out their political intelligence\r\nfiles for them, would be more than counterbalanced by the fact that such\r\nnews would make American newspapermen, officials, officers and others\r\nread the propaganda in order to get the facts.\r\n\r\nOver and above the direct contribution to straight news or intelligence,\r\nenemy propaganda in times of war or crisis affords a clue to enemy\r\nstrategy. If the coordination is not present the propaganda may do the\r\nenemy himself harm. But the moment coordination is present, and one end\r\nof the coordinate is handed over to us, we can start figuring what the\r\ncoordination is for. Sometimes propaganda is sacrificed for weightier\r\nconsiderations of security; German propaganda gave little advance\r\nwarning of a war with the U.S.S.R., and Soviet propaganda gave none. In\r\nother instances, the coordination does give the show away.\r\n\r\nIn 1941-1942, the Japanese radio began to show an unwholesome interest\r\nin Christmas Island in its broadcasts to Japanese at home and abroad.\r\nChristmas Island, below Sumatra, was pointed out as a really important\r\nplace, and tremendously significant in naval strategy. Subsequently the\r\nJapanese armed forces went to and took Christmas Island. The home public\r\nwas delighted that this vital spot had been secured. Of course,\r\nChristmas Island was not as important as the Japanese radio said it was,\r\nbut the significant thing was that the radio talked about it _ahead of\r\ntime_. For what little it was worth the Japanese had given us warning.\r\n\r\nEnemy realization of an impending defeat may be preceded by\r\ndisparagement of the importance of the area in which the defeat is to\r\ntake place, or by description to the home audience of the enormous\r\nstrength which enemy forces face at that particular place. Enemy\r\naction--when the enemy is security-minded--may be anticipated from his\r\ncomplete silence on something which he would normally talk about. It\r\nmust have seemed odd that the Americans stopped talking about nuclear\r\nfission altogether, when prewar years had seen a certain number of news\r\nitems on the subject in the New York press each month.\r\n\r\nA nation getting ready to strike _à la_ Pearl Harbor may prepare by\r\nalleging American aggression. A nation preparing to break the peace\r\nfrequently gets out peace propaganda of the most blatant sort, trying to\r\nmake sure that its own audience (as well as the world) will believe the\r\nreal responsibility to lie in the victim whom he attacks. Hitler\r\nprotested his love of Norwegian neutrality; then he hit, claiming that\r\nhe was protecting it from the British. No hard-and-fast rules can be\r\nmade up for all wars or all belligerents. The Germans behaved according\r\nto one pattern; the Japanese, another.\r\n\r\nFor example, the German High Command sought to avoid bragging about\r\nanything they could not actually accomplish. They often struck blows\r\nwithout warning but they never said they would strike a blow when they\r\nknew or believed that they could not do it. The British and Americans\r\nmade up a timetable of this, and were able to guess how fast the Germans\r\nthought they were going to advance in Russia. Knowing this, the British\r\nand Americans planned their propaganda to counter the German boasts;\r\nthey tried to pin the Germans down to objectives they knew the Germans\r\nwould not take, in order to demonstrate to the peoples of Europe that\r\nNazi Germany had finally bitten off more than it could chew.\r\n\r\nLater, the Allies remembered this German habit when the Nazis on the\r\nradio began talking about their own secret weapons. When the British\r\nbombed the V-1 ramps on the French coast, the German radio stopped that\r\ntalk. The British therefore had additional grounds for supposing that\r\nthe ramps they had bombed were a part of the secret weapon the Germans\r\nbragged about. The British further knew that the Germans would try to\r\ncounter the psychological effect of the announcement of Allied D-Day\r\nwith some pretty vivid news of their own. When the German radio began\r\nmentioning secret weapons again, the British suspected that the Germans\r\nhad gotten around the damage done to the ramps. D-Day came; the Germans,\r\nin one single broadcast designed to impress the Japanese and Chinese,\r\nannounced that the secret German weapon was about to be turned loose,\r\nand that more such weapons would follow. One day later the first V-1 hit\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chart IV._\r\n\r\nENEMY MENTION OF SELECTED TOPICS, FIRST HALF-YEAR, NUMBER OF MENTIONED\r\nTOPICS PER 10-DAY PERIOD, WITH REFERENCE TO NAVAL WARFARE, FOOD SUPPLY\r\nAND SECRET WEAPONS]\r\n\r\nIn order to follow this type of propaganda, a quantitative chart is\r\nneeded. A sample imaginary chart for a three-month period is given in\r\nchart IV. This chart reveals at a glance the fact that the enemy kept\r\nmentioning food supply and naval warfare until the middle of March,\r\nbecause he presumably thought his blockade runners would bring in more\r\nfood. After March, food drops in emphasis but naval warfare continues to\r\nbe stressed. In May, following enemy admission to himself of the\r\nhopeless naval situation, naval warfare drops almost altogether out of\r\nsight. Foodstuffs continue to be modestly mentioned as the enemy\r\nexplained away minor difficulties, but the use of secret weapons\r\npropaganda shows that the enemy propagandists had to have something\r\nsensational to keep up the courage of the home audience. Whether the\r\nenemy really had a secret weapon or not, depends on the national\r\ncharacter, past records, and so forth. The Germans and Japanese both\r\nsaid they had world-shaking secret weapons. The Germans delivered; the\r\nJapanese did not.\r\n\r\nSuch quantity records will also be useful in showing the enemy's\r\npropaganda statistically with reference to number of words uttered on\r\neach of his major subjects, number of inches of newspaper columns for\r\nspecified kinds of news, and so on. Percentage charts show which major\r\nshifts his propaganda performs. Audience charts (that is, how much time\r\nhe spends addressing workers, pacifists, mothers, minorities, etc.) show\r\nwhich groups he is really trying to reach. Emphasis charts for selected\r\ntopics on which your own propaganda has been active show how much you\r\nforce him to talk about something which he may not wish to discuss.\r\n\r\nSuch statistical use is possible only if usable records are maintained.\r\nA basic item-by-item file of all important or new items, combined with a\r\nworksheet of the amount of radio time or printed space the enemy put\r\ninto use for a stated period, will provide the materials needed for\r\npropanal. Propanal is indispensable to psychological warfare. It sifts\r\nordinary intelligence out from propaganda in one process, processing\r\nstraight intelligence ready for the intelligence people to use, yet\r\nproviding analysis for psychological warfare purposes.\r\n\r\nFor peacetime purposes, it is to be remembered that though enemies may\r\nhide their scientists, their launching ramps, or their rockets, they\r\ncannot hide the occasion for war, nor their own readiness measures. No\r\ngovernment can afford to seem the plain unqualified aggressor.\r\n_Propanal_ may prove to be one of the soundest war-forecasting systems\r\navailable to us in a period of ultra-destructive weapons. Psychological\r\nmobilization may be disguised: it cannot be concealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8\r\n\r\nPropaganda Intelligence\r\n\r\n\r\nThe psychological warfare operator can usually count on two basic\r\ninterests of his listener. In the field he can be sure that the enemy\r\ntroops are interested in themselves. In the enemy homeland he can be\r\nsure that the civilians are interested in _their_ enemy--himself. He has\r\ntherefore a certain leeway in which he can be sure of doing no harm, and\r\nmay accomplish good, if he confines his propaganda to simple, factual\r\nand plainly honest statements on these subjects. Pompousness, intricacy\r\nand bad taste will recoil against him; it is unwise to employ these even\r\nwhen the situation is well under control. In a developing situation the\r\npropagandist can remain safe by confining himself to simple statements\r\nas to how strong his country's armed forces are, how realistic and\r\neffective their leadership. Elementary information giving the favorable\r\naspects of his economic, strategic and diplomatic situation may also\r\nprove valuable initial propaganda.\r\n\r\nThis interest can be counted on throughout the war. The enemy is always\r\nnews. The wise enemy realizes this and keeps himself in the news,\r\ntrusting that in the wider understanding of himself, his politics and\r\nculture there is the opening for a more favorable peace in the event of\r\ndefeat, or for a more docile submission in the event of his own victory.\r\nOnly unimportant enemies fail to become news. (Few Americans, for\r\nexample, realize that we were at war with Bulgaria in World War II. Had\r\nthe Bulgars developed sensational weapons, there would have been a\r\nsudden upswing of interest in them. People would have realized that\r\nBulgaria, like Hungary and long-lost Avaria, was once a fierce Asiatic\r\nstate grafted onto the European system; the fabulous power of the Old\r\nBulgarian Empire would have become known, and the names of Krum, Symeon\r\nand the Czar Samuel added to our calendar of hate. But Bulgaria never\r\ndid enough against the United States to count as an enemy, and even\r\nsucceeded, by diplomatic ineptitude, in getting into a state of war with\r\nall the Axis Powers and all the United Nations simultaneously; Bulgaria\r\nescaped the fame which goes with hostility. Contrast this with Japan:\r\nthousands of Americans have learned Japanese; Japanese national\r\ncharacter is known to us; war has done in a five-year span what\r\neducation could not have accomplished in a generation.) The wise\r\npropagandist can, when in doubt, play good music on the air, or he\r\ncan--with equal prudence--give the enemy his own elementary-school\r\nhistory and language texts. These do no harm, and may achieve\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 28: Nostalgic Black._ Soldiers in all wars have\r\ngotten homesick. Propaganda appeals to homesickness in many ways. One of\r\nthe simplest is the device shown in this German black leaflet, which\r\nshows the husband turning off the alarm clock while the wife wakes up.\r\nThe printed message on the reverse makes out a discouraging case for the\r\nsoldier's opportunity to return home, pointing out that the GI in\r\nEurope, even after victory, will face \"that nasty jungle war ... in the\r\nFar East.\" No identification of the leaflet is given.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 29: Nostalgic White, Misfire._ Figure 30 was\r\ncarefully adapted to Japanese customs. The mere fact that the Americans\r\nknew enough about Japan to celebrate a homey Japanese holiday was\r\nprobably enough to make the Japanese reader examine the leaflet\r\ncarefully. Here is a combined nostalgic and surrender leaflet showing\r\nhow surrender leads the Japanese soldier back to his wife and children.\r\nThe drawing looks American rather than Japanese, and it is not likely\r\nthat a genuine Japanese could have been made homesick by use of this\r\nleaflet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 30: Nostalgic White._ On March 5 of every year\r\nthe Japanese celebrate the colorful custom of Boys' Day. Kites in the\r\nform of carp are flown over the cities and countryside and millions of\r\nfamilies set out to give their little sons an excursion or some other\r\ntreat. (It is characteristic of the Japanese that there is no Girls'\r\nDay.) This leaflet, from Psychological Warfare Branch, USAFPA, was\r\ndesigned for dropping on May 5. It ends with the appeal, \"You must guard\r\nthe strength of the new Japan, your treasure, your children.\" Thus it\r\ncombines homesickness, patriotism, and pre-surrender indoctrination.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=News as Intelligence.= Harmlessness is, however, a poor ideal for men\r\nat war; the propagandist who keeps out of mischief is doing only half\r\nhis job. To make his message take effect he must convey to the enemy\r\nthose kinds of information which tend to disrupt enemy unity, discount\r\nenemy expectation of success, lower the enemy will to resist. He cannot\r\ndo so by means of recorded symphonies or tourist lectures, no matter how\r\nwell done. He must turn to the first weapon of propaganda, the news.\r\n\r\nThe official propagandist is not a newspaperman. Since he speaks for an\r\narmy or a government, his utterance is _officially responsible_. He must\r\nbe as timely as the peacetime press, but must at the same time be as\r\ncautious as a government press agent. He is torn between two\r\nresponsibilities: his responsibility to the job of propaganda, which\r\nrequires him to get interesting information and get it out to the enemy\r\nquickly; and his responsibility to the official policies of his own\r\ngovernment, which requires him to release nothing unconfirmed, nothing\r\nthat could do harm, or that might embarrass or hurt the government. (A\r\nsort of institutional schizophrenia is common to all propaganda\r\noffices.)\r\n\r\nThe sources of news are various. Classified incoming operational reports\r\nof the Army and Navy contain material of high interest to the enemy.\r\nThere are obvious reasons for denying access to such information to the\r\npropaganda people. Propaganda men might think of their audience first\r\nand security second. If they do not know the secret information, but are\r\nadvised by military consultants who do, security will be better\r\nmaintained and the propagandist will not labor under the handicap of a\r\ndouble standard of information--what they know, and what they dare to\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nIn technically advanced countries, the regular commercial facilities of\r\npress and radio continue to do a normal news job, and usually do better\r\nwork than the drafted amateurs in the government. (What intelligence\r\nagency in Washington could compile a weekly report as comprehensive,\r\nwell edited and coldly planned as _Time_ magazine?[32] The author often\r\nyearned to paraphrase _Time_, rearranging it and classifying it TOP\r\nSECRET, in order to astound his associates with the inside dope to which\r\nhe had access.) The nature of news is not affected by its\r\nclassification, and the distinction between news produced on the Federal\r\npayroll and news produced off it often consists of the superior\r\nprofessionalism of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence that goes into the making of propaganda must compete\r\nfor attention with the home newspaper of the enemy. It must therefore be\r\nup-to-date, well put, authentic. There is no more space in propaganda\r\nfor the lie, farce, hoax, or joke than there is room for it in a\r\nfirst-class newspaper. Even if exaggerations or nonsense appear in the\r\ncommercial press of his own country, the propagandist must realize that\r\nhe is Honorary G-2 to the enemy--a G-2 whose function consists of\r\ntransmitting news _the ultimate effect of which should be bad_ but which\r\nshould go forth with each separate item newsworthy and palatable. (A\r\nlittle trick of the human mind helps all propagandists in this regard.\r\nMost people have a streak of irresponsibility in them, which makes bad\r\nnews much more interesting than good. There is a yearning for bad news\r\nand a genuine willingness to pass it along. Bad news increases the\r\ntension upon the individual and tickles his sense of the importance of\r\nthings; good news relieves the tension, and to that extent has the\r\neffect of a let-down.)\r\n\r\nThe palatability of news is not concerned so much with its content as\r\nwith its trustworthiness to the enemy, its seeming to deal with straight\r\nfact, its non-editorialized presentation. (One of the reasons why Soviet\r\nCommunist propaganda, after all these years, is still relatively\r\nunsuccessful, lies in the incapacity of the Communists to get out a\r\nnewspaper with news in it. They put their editorial slant in all their\r\nnews articles. \"Man bites dog\" would not make the front page in Russia\r\nunless the dog were Stalinist and the man reactionary.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 31: Oestrous Black._ Young human beings,\r\nespecially young males, are apt to give considerable attention to sex.\r\nIn areas of military operations, they are removed from the stimuli of\r\nsecondary sex references which are (in America) an accepted part of\r\neveryone's daily life: bathing beauty photos, magazine covers,\r\nsemi-nudes in advertisements, etc. Our enemies tried to use the\r\nresulting pin-up craze for propaganda purposes, hoping that a vain\r\narousal of oestrum would diminish morale. This choice Japanese item is\r\nfrom the Philippines. (The best collection of these is kept in a locked\r\nfile--for experts only--at the Library of Congress.)]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese who obediently hated the Americans when it was their duty\r\nto do so nevertheless could not help looking at maps that showed where\r\nthe Americans actually were. Nazis who despised us and everything we\r\nstood for nevertheless studied the photographs of our new light bombers.\r\nThe appeal of credible fact is universal; propaganda does not consist of\r\ndoctoring the fact with moralistic blather, but of selecting that fact\r\nwhich is correct, interesting, and bad for the enemy to know.[33]\r\n\r\nOn the friendly side of the battle lines, the procurement of our own\r\nnews is a budgetary matter. The propaganda office can subscribe to the\r\nnews tickers, newspapers, telegraph services, and so on. How much is a\r\nmatter of administrative housekeeping. In the field, the communications\r\nofficer can frequently steal news from the news agencies of his own\r\ncountry or allied countries by the process of picking it out of the air.\r\nIt would be highly unpatriotic of the news agency to send him a bill in\r\nthe zone of operations, and he can classify his record copies of his\r\nmaterial RESTRICTED so that the owners of the material would have no\r\nlegitimate business acquiring copies that could later be taken into\r\ncourt to support a claim. (Americans would not do this, of course; the\r\nreference is to Byzantines.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 32: Oestrous Grey._ This and the succeeding\r\nillustration show a series of four leaflets which the Nazis used against\r\nAmerican troops in Europe. Anti-morale in intent, they rely on the\r\nillustrations to get attention and then develop their malicious,\r\nsalacious anti-Semitic story. The series illustrates the strength and\r\nweakness of Nazi propaganda.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 33: Oestrous Grey, Continued._ Concluding the\r\nseries begun in the preceding illustrations, these Nazi leaflets tried\r\nto lower American morale by combining oestrum, resentment,\r\ndiscouragement and inter-American hatred. The Dr. Mordecai Ezekiel\r\nmentioned in No. 2 is a real person, a splendid American and\r\nconscientious official. The Nazis used his name because it was so\r\nplainly Jewish, hoping that the ignorance of the American troops would\r\npermit their lies to spread.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Need for Timeliness.= Some white propaganda and all black\r\npropaganda needs to be written so as to fit in with what the enemy is\r\nreading, listening to, or talking about in his home country. The use of\r\nantiquated slang, an old old joke, reference to a famous man as living\r\nwhen he died some time ago, lack of understanding of the new wartime\r\nconditions under which the listener lives and worries--such things sour\r\na radio program quickly. In radio, the propagandist must be living in\r\nthe same time as his listeners. Since the propagandist cannot shuttle\r\nbetween the enemy country and his own radio office (unless he is a\r\nbraver and more elusive man than governments ever call for); he must try\r\nto get the up-to-the-minute touch by other means. Without it he is lost.\r\nHe will be talking about something that happened a long time ago, not\r\nthe situation which he is trying to affect.\r\n\r\nThis need may be called _timeliness_.\r\n\r\nIt can be served by obtaining all the most recent enemy publications\r\nthat may be available, by listening attentively to enemy prisoners and\r\ncaptured civilians, and by carefully analyzing the enemy's current\r\nbroadcasts to his own people. The Nazis made the unnecessary mistake of\r\nassuming that isolationism used the same old language after Pearl\r\nHarbor. They were right in assuming that there was considerable\r\nanti-internationalist and anti-Roosevelt sentiment left in the United\r\nStates, but they were hopelessly wrong in using the isolationist\r\nlanguage of mid-1941 as late as mid-1942. Pearl Harbor had dated all\r\nthat and the isolationist-interventionist argument had shifted to other\r\nground. When the Nazis went on using the old language, they were as\r\nconspicuous as last year's hat at a women's club. Instead of making\r\nfriends and influencing people, they made themselves sound ignorant and\r\nlook silly. They lacked the element of timeliness. They could have\r\ngotten it by procuring representative American publications in Lisbon\r\nand studying them.\r\n\r\nPropaganda is like a newspaper; it has to be timeless or brand-new. In\r\nbetween, it has no value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 34: Obscene Black._ One of the wildest adventures\r\nof World War II concerns this now rare \"Chinese Federal Reserve Bank\"\r\none-dollar bill. The bank was a Japanese puppet outfit in Peiping. The\r\nJapanese had banknotes engraved by Chinese artists, and only after the\r\nnew pro-Japanese banknotes had been issued all over the city did they\r\nnotice what the \"ancient scholar\" was doing with his hands. The engraver\r\nhad disappeared and the Chinese enjoyed a rare, morale-stimulating\r\nlaugh. Propaganda gestures such as this--spontaneous, saucy,\r\nsilly--achieve effects which planned operations rarely attain.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Opinion Analysis.= In a favorable intelligence situation, espionage can\r\nsucceed in running a Gallup poll along the enemy's Main Street. When\r\nthis is done, the active propaganda operator has some very definite\r\nissues at hand on which he can begin work. When it is not possible to\r\nsend the cloak-and-dagger boys walking up and down the Boulevard of the\r\nMartyrs of the Eleventh of July, propanal, properly handled, can produce\r\nalmost the same result. The opinion of the enemy can be figured out in\r\nterms of what enemy propaganda is trying to do.\r\n\r\nTo be useful, opinion analysis must be systematic. For a while the\r\nauthor had the interesting job of interviewing all the latest arrivals\r\nfrom Tokyo at a certain headquarters. The travelers would usually be\r\npumped up with a sense of their own smartness in having evaded the\r\nJapanese and arrived at Allied territory. You could almost hear them\r\nthinking, \"Oh, boy, if Gendarmerie Chief Bakayama could only see me\r\nnow!\" They were ready, in Army parlance, to spill their guts. The only\r\nitem on which most of them maintained one-man security was the question,\r\n\"Why, chum, did you yourself go to Tokyo in the first place?\" Outside of\r\nthat, they were eager to talk. (Some of them had frightfully good\r\nreasons to be eager; the adverb is literal.) With such sources of\r\ninformation, the author thought that he could find out in short order\r\nwhat the Japanese were thinking.\r\n\r\nHe found out, all right. He found out every single time. The refugee\r\nengineer said the Japanese were so depressed that there was a bull\r\nmarket in butcher knives. The absconding dairyman said the Japanese\r\nwere ready to die with gloom. The eloping wife said she never saw happy\r\nJapanese any more. The military school deserter said the Japanese lay\r\nawake all night every night listening for American air raids. The\r\nreformed puppet said the Japanese had just gone to pieces. Then each of\r\nthem grinned (the interviews were individual, of course), and expected\r\nto be patted on the head for bringing such good news.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 35: Informational Sheet._ This British leaflet\r\ncombines a message for Arabs with instructions for British pilots forced\r\ndown in the desert. The propaganda content is closely associated with\r\nthe practical mission of the leaflet.]\r\n\r\nTheir comments were worthless. What the enemy thinks _in general_ is\r\nworth nothing unless your troops are already in his suburbs. What an\r\ninformant thinks the enemy thinks is worth even less. What do you,\r\nreader, think right now? What do you think you think? See? the question\r\nis nonsensical. To work, it has to be specific: What do you think about\r\nthe price of new suits? What do you think about Senator O'May and\r\nCongressman MacNaples? Do you think that we will ever have to fight\r\nLaputa? Are you satisfied with your present rate of pay? Why?\r\n\r\nWhat a person thinks--his opinion--is workable in relation to what he\r\ndoes. In practical life his opinion takes effect only when it is part of\r\nthe opinion of a group. Some groups are formed by the common opinion and\r\nhave nothing else in common: at a spiritualist meeting you may see the\r\nbanker sitting next to his own charwoman. Most groups are groups because\r\nof things which the people _are_ (Negroes, descendants of Francis Bacon,\r\nthe hard-of-hearing); or things they _do_ (electrical workers, lawyers,\r\nfarmer, stamp collectors), or things they _have_ (factory owners,\r\nnothing but wages, apartment houses) in common. The community of\r\nsomething practical makes the group have a community of opinion which\r\narises from the problems they think they face with respect to their\r\ncommon interests. Such groups are not only opinion groups, they are\r\ninterest groups. It is these groups that do things _as groups_. It is\r\nthese groups that propaganda tries to stir up, move, set against each\r\nother, and use in any handy way. (Few individuals belong to just one\r\ngroup at a time; the groups are almost illimitable in number.)\r\n\r\nThe propagandist should not get the idea that just because a group\r\nexists it is a potential source of weakness or cleavage. Workers are not\r\nalways against employers, nor the aged against the young, nor women\r\nagainst men, nor shippers against railwaymen. In a well run society,\r\ngroups have interest only for limited purposes. Railwaymen are not\r\npermanently hostile to truckers, shippers, fliers, canal operators. At\r\nthe moment they may be maddest of all at the insurance companies because\r\nof some quarrel about insurance premiums and risks.\r\n\r\nThe poor propagandist tries to butt in on every fight, even when there\r\nis none. Often his propaganda is received the way an intervenor is\r\nreceived in most family quarrels, with the bland question, \"_What_\r\nfight? We ain't mad.\" Sound propaganda picks only those group issues\r\nwhich are acute enough to stand a little help from outside. If outside\r\nhelp would be a kiss-of-death to the group that is helped, then black\r\npropaganda instead of white is indicated. In any case, sound operating\r\nintelligence is the first precondition to the attempted psychological\r\nmanipulation of enemy groups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 36: Counterpropaganda Instructions._ The\r\nWehrmacht in the West had a unit bearing the code designation Skorpion.\r\nThis unit combined the functions of offensive and defensive propaganda,\r\nwhich remained separate throughout the war in the U.S. Army. The\r\ninformation service sheet shown provides clear, simple leads for\r\ncounterpropaganda by selecting usable (usable for the Germans, that is)\r\nitems from Allied sources. From this raw material, morale officers could\r\nmake up their own leaflets, lectures, or broadcasts.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Profile of Opinion.= Opinion analysis can present a _profile of enemy\r\nopinion_. To make a profile, proceed as though assembling a photo-strip\r\nmap taken by an aerial camera. Take the whole enemy country and divide\r\nit into major groups by percentages. Select, particularly, those groups\r\nyou are interested in addressing. If you have _kamikaze_-minded\r\ncollaborators, send them in to the enemy country to ask a thousand\r\nenemies the same question, selecting the thousand the same way that the\r\ntotal population is made up. If the country is 32% Catholic, the\r\nthousand interviewees should include 320 Catholics. If the country is\r\n36% urban and 61% rural (3% unexplained), get 610 of your interviewees\r\nfrom the country. The questions do not have to be asked in precisely the\r\nsame form, but they should bear on precisely the same issues. When your\r\nagents come back you have a poll. If you do not have agents, then use\r\nthe percentages from reference books, and try to estimate how many\r\ndefinite groups have what specific grievances. You are then in a\r\nposition to proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Interrogation.= When processing prisoners of war, it is an excellent\r\nidea to deal with them for morale intelligence as well as for general\r\nand assorted military information. Questions should not aim at what the\r\nprisoner thinks he thinks about God, his leader, his country, and so on,\r\nbut should concern themselves with those things which most interest the\r\nprisoner himself. Does his wife write that the babies have enough\r\ndiapers? How is the mail service? Is he worried about war workers\r\ngetting his prewar job? How much money is he saving? How is the food?\r\nHow were the non-coms--did they treat him right? Did he get enough\r\nfurloughs? Does he think that anybody is making too much money at home?\r\nMost men carry over into military services the occupational interests\r\nwhich they had as civilians. A carpenter in uniform, even though he may\r\nbe a good infantry top sergeant, is still a carpenter, and information\r\ncan be obtained from him as to the problems of skilled labor, of union\r\nmembers, of the poorer city dwellers, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe profile obtained from civilian polls or from propanal can then be\r\nparalleled in the field. Set up a graph showing the entire enemy army.\r\nUse several graphs if the army splits along racial, national or plainly\r\nsectional lines. On each graph, enter the component groups. From the\r\npoll or from the interrogations, list the dissatisfaction in terms of\r\nseriousness with which the dissatisfyee attributes to it; it is not what\r\nyou think he should worry about that is important. It's what actually he\r\ndoes worry about. His weighting counts. Make up a scale, quantitative\r\non the actual count of mentions of particular gripes. (For example, out\r\nof 699 prisoners, of whom 167 were union members in civil life, there\r\nwere 234 separate voluntary mentions of dissatisfaction with the enemy\r\ngovernment's labor union policy). When that quantitative count changes\r\nup or down, you have a definite guide with which to control your own\r\npropaganda policy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 37: Defensive Counterpropaganda._ The \"National\r\nSocialist Leadership Staff of the Wehrmacht\" got out this Communications\r\nfor the Troops as a guidance sheet for company talks. The content\r\nincludes \"Thoughts About the Volkssturm,\" \"The Celebrated American\r\nFreedoms,\" and \"Small Requests, but Important.\" This issue is dated from\r\nJanuary 1945.]\r\n\r\nOr you can proceed qualitatively. List enemy dissatisfaction under terms\r\nsuch as these for any one issue (shoe rationing, health facilities,\r\nminority rights, esteem for government leaders, etc.): Prisoner--\r\n\r\n  (1) is completely satisfied and has no complaints.\r\n  (2) has a few complaints but is generally satisfied.\r\n  (3) has many complaints and does not expect improvement.\r\n  (4) is despondent about the whole situation.\r\n  (5) is definitely antagonistic to home authorities in this matter.\r\n\r\nRate each prisoner or captured civilian according to your best judgment.\r\nThen make up percentage lists of the grounds for dissatisfaction of each\r\ncomponent group in the enemy society. (This latter figure will be\r\nimpressive in documents but will not mean as much for practical purposes\r\nas will the more specific percentages under each separate head.)\r\n\r\nIf you feel like showing off, average everything into everything else\r\nand call it the Gross Index of Total Enemy Morale. This won't fool\r\nanyone who knows the propaganda business, and you won't be able to _do_\r\nanything with or about it, but you can hang it on a month-by-month chart\r\nin the front office, where visitors can be impressed at getting in on a\r\nmilitary secret. (Incidentally, if some smart enemy agent sees it and\r\nreports it back, enemy intelligence experts will go mad trying to figure\r\nout just how you got that figure. It's like the old joke that the\r\n_average_ American is ten-elevenths White, 52% female, and always\r\nslightly pregnant.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Specificity.= Good propaganda intelligence provides:\r\n\r\n  (a) news;\r\n\r\n  (b) military intelligence which can be released as news;\r\n\r\n  (c) military intelligence which cannot be released as news, but\r\n  knowledge of which will prevent the propaganda operator from making\r\n  mistakes or miscalculations in reporting the news;\r\n\r\n  (d) enemy news;\r\n\r\n  (e) up-to-the-minute enemy slang, hobbies, fads, grievances, and other\r\n  matters of current public attention;\r\n\r\n  (f) specific grievances of specific groups and of the nation as a\r\n  whole, should these arise;\r\n\r\n  (g) information about probable inter-group conflicts;\r\n\r\n  (h) types and forms of discontent with enemy authority;\r\n\r\n  (i) identification of unpopular or popular enemy personalities;\r\n\r\n  (j) all other information that will enable the psychological warfare\r\n  operator to act promptly and sympathetically in taking the side of\r\n  specific enemy individuals against their authorities or other enemy\r\n  groups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 38: Black \"Counterpropaganda.\"_ Seeing that the\r\nGermans had a good counter propaganda medium, the Allies decided to use\r\nit themselves. They issued this \"counterpropaganda\" sheet, shown in\r\noriginal and facsimile in English. The \"blackness\" is not very black,\r\nsince few Germans would consider this to be German in origin, once they\r\nhad read it.]\r\n\r\nEnemy opinion cannot be manipulated in general. It must be met on its\r\nown ground--the current everyday thoughts of enemy citizens and\r\nsoldiers. These thoughts do not usually concern grandiose problems of\r\npolitical ethics. They are practical like your own.[34] They must be\r\nappealed to in a way which makes the listener really listen, makes the\r\nreader stop and reread, makes them both think it over later. Getting the\r\nattention of the enemy is not enough. Most enemies will pay plenty of\r\nattention to you--too much, at times. Getting sympathetic attention is\r\nwhat counts.\r\n\r\nThis can be done only with specific grounds. With the news, you and he\r\nhave a genuine common interest. Using his real troubles as a link, you\r\nmust create that common interest. The force, the effectiveness of your\r\nargument may make him forget that it is the enemy who has brought his\r\nattention to this issue. You must leave him with the feeling, \"By golly,\r\nthat fellow is right!\"\r\n\r\nBut to talk about his troubles, effectively, you must know what they\r\nreally are. You must see it his way before you start showing him that\r\nhis way is your way, that you think that he is really on your side, and\r\nthat his bosses' side is wrong, incorrect and doomed to get whipped,\r\nanyhow. Propaganda can operate only on the basis of _specificity_. Real\r\npersuasion can be sought only on the basis of real sympathy with real\r\ntroubles. Old, incorrectly guessed, or poorly described issues are worse\r\nthan none at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9\r\n\r\nEstimate of the Situation\r\n\r\n\r\nIn physical warfare, the inherent instability of every situation is\r\nconcealed by the apparent definiteness of the operation. Panic, revolt\r\nor dissolution of regiments is not normally figured into the situation.\r\nThe assumption is made--and for professional military purposes must be\r\nmade--that all identical units are of equal quality unless proved\r\notherwise, that all men in a unit will respond with psychological\r\nuniformity unless they are reported out physically by medical reports,\r\nthat the unit will be capable of doing tomorrow what it did yesterday.\r\nThe terrain comes in as a constant factor and even such variables as\r\nweather can be calculated in terms of a predictable risk. Nevertheless,\r\nevery experienced soldier knows that things do not always work out the\r\nway they should, that unexplained or unforeseen factors sooner or later\r\ncomplicate or frustrate the best plans, and that warfare is a huge\r\ngamble with a superficial but very necessary coating of exactitude.\r\n\r\nIn psychological warfare, these considerations apply even more sharply.\r\nCombat at least has terrain, order of battle, logistics, estimated\r\ncapabilities and other concrete factors with which to figure. There is a\r\nknown degree of difference between one enemy division and five enemy\r\ndivisions. There is the possibility of computing the time which the\r\nenemy will need to fulfill this capability or that, and the equally good\r\npossibility of computing time on our side for countermeasures. Even in\r\nsuch very long-range operations as strategic bombing, economic factors\r\ncan be figured out to give the operation at least the coloration of\r\nprecision. With propaganda, none of this is possible.\r\n\r\nThe propagandist never knows the terrain, because his terrain is the\r\nenemy mind in its entirety--a factor beyond the understanding of any\r\nman. The enemy can have strongholds of faith to be shaken but the\r\npropagandist can never say, \"This factor is finished. Therefore we\r\nproceed to the next.\" There is neither victory nor defeat, only the\r\nendless seesaw of probable accomplishments or probable blunders. The\r\nhonest psychological warfare operative will admit that he does not know\r\nwhere he is at any given moment, how far from his start, how near to his\r\ngoal. Even with surrender of the enemy, propaganda cannot be judged to\r\nhave met with complete failure or complete success, because propaganda\r\nis an interminable stream going on into international affairs and\r\ncarrying over to the next war. Psychological warfare can be given\r\napparent certainty only by the creation of assumptions on the part of\r\nthe planner. The assumptions will not stand up if questioned by a clever\r\nphilosopher, any more than did the basic assumptions of the German\r\nGeneral Staff when questioned by the sardonic Trotzky at Brest-Litovsk.\r\nNevertheless, the assumptions can work for planning purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Definiteness of the Goal.= The first assumption to make is this: goals\r\ncan be sought with some hope of success. The propaganda planner uses the\r\nintelligence available to him. He consults with knowledgeable persons.\r\nHe defines (1) specific kinds of demoralization and discord he wishes to\r\ncreate, (2) the particular enemy audiences in which he wishes to create\r\nthem, (3) the types of argument he proposes to use, and (4) the media\r\nthrough which he intends to project his propaganda. He assumes that the\r\nkind of discord, depression or surrender which he seeks will hasten the\r\nend of the war. In so doing, he is on ground only a little less sure\r\nthan that of the strategic bombing planner, who also seeks results\r\nindirectly.\r\n\r\nFor field operations, the goal of the propagandist is to sap the\r\nresistance of enemy troops. If the troops are moving forward and are not\r\nlikely to be in a mood to surrender, then other goals, such as conflict\r\nbetween officers and men, encouraging desertion, informing enemy troops\r\nof bad news elsewhere in the war, or morale-depression may be sought. In\r\neach case, the propaganda must be aimed at a goal, and a goal is as\r\nessential to the operation of psychological warfare as is definition of\r\na target for artillery or bombing. No one ever accomplishes anything\r\nshooting \"somewhere or other\"; no one propagandizes successfully unless\r\nhe seeks the attainment of a state of mind or series of actions which\r\nmay actually happen. Most times, it is thus impossible to aim at the\r\ntotal surrender of the enemy armies or state. One can aim for concrete\r\noperational purposes only at specific enemy troubles or effects. For the\r\nfield, troop surrenders; for the home front, interference with the enemy\r\nwar effort--these are about as general as goals can be made.\r\n\r\nThey can be made very specific indeed. A situation reported by\r\nintelligence may provide an almost perfect opening for psychological\r\nwarfare. If the enemy press reports that twenty-three embezzlers have\r\nbeen detected in food supply and have been shot, it is a perfect opening\r\nfor the black propaganda goal, \"to conduce to enemy mistrust of food\r\ncontrol, to increase food spoilage, to lower efficiency of enemy food\r\nconsumption through enhancing misuse of food supply.\" Some of the means\r\nmight be these. An alleged enemy leaflet could be prepared warning\r\nquartermasters to destroy canned foods that have lost labels; another\r\nleaflet describing diseases that come from partly spoiled food; an\r\n\"enemy\" allegation (from your side or, better, from neutral territory)\r\nthat the political chiefs of the enemy country are the biggest food\r\nembezzlers of all; getting a black-radio and rumor campaign under way\r\ndescribing the seven hundred and eighty-three people who died last\r\nmonth as a result of eating musty food (even though your own doctors say\r\nthe mustiness may not interfere with the wholesomeness of that\r\nparticular food); describing common diseases that actually occur in the\r\nenemy country, such as arthritis, stomach ulcers, sinus headaches or\r\ninfectious jaundice, and blaming them all on the foods the enemy\r\ngovernment distributes to the enemy people. On white radio, features\r\ncould be put on describing the unhappy plight of your own side, where\r\npeople may get their rashers of bacon for breakfast only every other\r\nday, and where nobody can have more than three eggs at a time; point out\r\nthat the government is worried that food prices have risen 5.3%, without\r\nmentioning at that time the fact that enemy prices have gone up 45% or\r\nmore. The definite goal gives the propaganda boys something to work on.\r\nPropaganda to the allies or satellites of the enemy can point out that\r\nthe enemy government is apt to dump the spoiled food onto the foreign\r\nmarket, that food spoiling in territory of the big enemy will make him\r\nrequisition more food from his little allies, et cetera.\r\n\r\nWhen the topic has been worked for a while, stop; keep it up only if\r\nactual news from the enemy country shows that they are having enough\r\nreal trouble with food to make your _improvements_ on the fact\r\nthoroughly credible.\r\n\r\nPropaganda cannot function in a vacuum framed by moral generalities. The\r\ngoal must be defined in the light of authentic news or intelligence. The\r\noperation can be sustained only if there is enough factual reality\r\nbehind it to make the propaganda fit the case known or credited by the\r\nmajority of the listeners, counted one by one.\r\n\r\nSince no trouble-free, wartime country has been known to exist, the\r\ngoals should be tailored to the troubles of the particular enemy, and\r\nshould aim at increasing real difficulties, building up pre-existing\r\ndoubts, stimulating genuine internal hostilities. Propaganda which\r\ninvents pure novelty gets nowhere. The Russians did not hesitate to\r\nappeal to Bismarck in order to show the professional German soldiers\r\nwhat a rotter Hitler was, and how stupid the Nazi strategy. But if\r\nBismarck had actually said nothing on the subject of the army in general\r\nor an Eastern war in particular, they would have been wise to leave him\r\nalone. If the Japanese had tried to make the ex-Confederate States\r\nsecede all over again, they would not have gotten anywhere because they\r\nwould not have started with a real grievance. But if they had alleged\r\nthat the Negro units were used for stevedoring because Whites regarded\r\nNegroes as unworthy of carrying weapons, they might have hit on a real\r\ngrievance. The goal must be deeply bedded in reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Propaganda Man.= It has been pointed out that the true terrain of\r\npsychological warfare--the private thoughts of the enemy people, one by\r\none--is known only to God. There is, however, a way of finding\r\napproximate terrain. That consists of setting up a hypothetical enemy\r\nlistener or reader, and then trying to figure things out from _his_\r\nangle.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do with the hypothetical man is to make him fit the\r\nkind of person who does get propaganda. In dealing with China, for\r\nexample, it would be no use to take a statistically true Chinese, who\r\nlived on a farm 1.3 acres in size, went to town 5.8 times a year, had\r\n3.6 children, and never read newspapers. The man to be set up would be\r\nthe _reachable_ man, the city, town or village dweller who had an income\r\n2.1 times greater than that of the average in his county, who owned 1.7\r\nlong coats, and who shared one newspaper with 6.8 neighbors. Take this\r\nlowest-common-denominator of a man who can be reached by enemy\r\npropaganda and by yours. Name him the Propaganda Man. (Realistically\r\nspeaking, modal and not arithmetical classes should be set up.)\r\n\r\nMake up the prewar life of the Propaganda Man. Use your regional experts\r\nas informants. What kinds of things did he like? What prejudices was he\r\napt to have? What kind of gossip did he receive and pass along? What\r\nkind of words disgusted him? What kind of patriotic appeal made him do\r\nthings? What did he think of your country before the war? What things\r\ndid he dislike you and your people for? What myths did he believe about\r\nAmerica--that all Americans drove sports convertibles while drinking\r\nliquor? that all had blonde sweethearts? that all exchanged gunfire\r\nperiodically? Of what American things did he think well--food, shoes,\r\nautos, personal freedom, others? What is he apt to be thinking now?\r\n\r\nTo this add what the enemy propaganda is trying to do to its Propaganda\r\nMan. That is, size up the domestic propaganda of the enemy in terms of\r\nthe concrete individuals at whom it is aimed. This may reveal the\r\nenemy's vital necessities and his concealed weaknesses. What _are_ the\r\nleaders trying to do? Are they trying to make the Propaganda Man get to\r\nwork on time? Are they trying to make him give up holidays willingly?\r\nAre they trying to make him think that your side will kill him if you\r\nwin? Are they trying to keep him from being worried about his city going\r\nup in an incandescent haze? Are they trying to make him believe that the\r\nconcrete shelters are good? Why are they harping so on the safety of the\r\nshelters? Has the Propaganda Man been muttering back about the\r\nflimsiness of the shelters? Does he want to be evacuated from target\r\ncities? Are the police being praised for their fairness and speed in\r\nissuing leave-the-city permits? Are illegal évacués being treated as\r\nscum and traitors and cowards?\r\n\r\nThen go after the Propaganda Man yourself. He is your friend. You are\r\nhis friend. The only enemy is the enemy Leader (or generals, or emperor,\r\nor capitalists, or \"They\"). How is the Propaganda Man going to hear from\r\nyou? Leaflets? Short-wave--and if so, why is he listening to the enemy\r\nin the first place? Standard-wave? Speaker planes? Rumors? Get things to\r\nhim that you know he will repeat, things which will interest him. Make\r\nup a list of the things he worries about each month, a list of the\r\nthings which the enemy propaganda is trying to do to him currently, a\r\nlist of the things your propaganda is trying to do. Do the three lists\r\nfit? Would they work on an actual living breathing thinking human being,\r\nwith the prejudices, frailty, nobility, greed, lubricity, and other\r\nmotives of the ordinary human being? If your list fits his real life, if\r\nyour list spoils the enemy propaganda list, if your list builds up a\r\npsychological effect of confusion, gloom, willingness-to-surrender which\r\naccumulates month after month, the terrain is favorable. It is in your\r\nPropaganda Man's head.\r\n\r\nThere are no maps of the human mind, but in certain special cases\r\nsociology and psychology can provide leads which even the most acute\r\nuntrained observation would otherwise overlook. During World War II, for\r\nexample, Mr. Geoffrey Gorer, a British anthropologist, was able to\r\nprovide character analyses of the Japanese that stood up under the\r\nrigorous analysis of experts long resident in Japan. Gorer took as base\r\ndata the experience of the Japanese infant in the first forty-odd months\r\nof life. How was the baby given toilet training? how was it weaned? how\r\nwas it disciplined into the family life? how did the small child learn\r\nwhat it was? Gorer found that Japanese domestic life started the child\r\nout with a mixture of uncertainty and defiance--that the infant soon\r\nlearned he was in a definite position in the human queue, where all\r\nabove him had to be respected on the threat of immediate and condign\r\nreprisal, while all below him could be mistreated almost with\r\nimpunity--that the Japanese had sad dirty little private thoughts about\r\nhimself to a degree unknown to ourselves or the Chinese--that the\r\nJapanese was in adult life the inevitable fulfillment of what he had\r\nbeen made in infancy: arrogant, timid, insanely brave, deferential,\r\nfearful of foreigners and overtly cruel to them.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Japanese identified persons, nations, or institutions\r\nas Female (peaceful, possessing enjoyments, subject to bullying) or as\r\nMale (fierce, counteraggressive, superordinate). The U.S.A. of Admiral\r\nPerry seemed Male; that of Cordell Hull, Female. These findings, applied\r\nto propaganda, gave British-American operations an audience unlike the\r\nJapanese whom missionaries, soldiers, diplomats, businessmen, and\r\njournalists had portrayed in such varied and inconsistent terms. This\r\nJapanese Propaganda Man (analyzed at a distance, since Gorer had never\r\nbeen nearer Japan than Indo-China) became a believable person. It was\r\nuncanny to see Japanese propaganda movies after reading the Gorer\r\nanalyses, and to find the Japanese government propagandists, by hunch\r\nand instinct, appealing to the same Propaganda Man whom Gorer, by bold\r\nbut permissible extrapolations, had revealed to Allied propaganda\r\nplanners.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Attribution of Motive.= One of the least factual elements in human\r\nlife is motive. Motive is hard to discern, even in one's own life, and\r\nit is difficult if not impossible to prove. It must frequently be\r\nattributed. Motive is therefore easily interpreted; \"falsification\" is\r\nalmost impossible because no matter how much probable motive is twisted,\r\nit still might fit the case. Motive is therefore excellent material for\r\npsychological warfare. (Those propaganda veterans, the Communists, have\r\na formula for showing that the motive of every person opposed to them is\r\nunprogressive, illiberal, and greedy, even if the person himself does\r\nnot know it. Their own motives are always pure because they are\r\n\"objectively\" and \"historically correct\" according to _science_, that\r\nis, according to the historical rigmaroles of Karl Marx. The formula is\r\na poor science, but a superb propaganda weapon.)\r\n\r\nWar eases the motive-switching operation because the leaders and people\r\non each side derive moral exhilaration from the common effort.\r\nOstensibly, politicians become statesmen; all higher-ranking officers\r\nbecome strategists; ordinary men become heroes, martyrs, adventurers.\r\nThe lofty process of war is one which psychologists will not explain in\r\nour time; it transposes ordinary persons and events to a frame of\r\nreference in which individuals are less self-conscious and also less\r\ncritical. Among European and American peoples, particularly, there\r\narises the assumption that because of war men should be brave and\r\nunselfish, women kind and chaste, yet alluring, officials\r\nself-sacrificing, and so on, even though the facts of the case in the\r\nparticular country involved may be very much to the contrary. The cruel\r\nfutility inherent in war is so plain to all civilized men that when war\r\ndoes come men overcompensate for it. They set up illusions.\r\n\r\nThis need not be taken as a criticism of war or of mankind. The world\r\nwould be a more inspiring place in which to dwell if people generally\r\nlived up to the wartime standards they impose on themselves. That these\r\nstandards are felt to be real is attested by the distinct drop of the\r\nsuicide rate in wartime, and the increase in suicide, murder, and crimes\r\nof delinquency after every war; that the change of role is largely\r\nillusory is attested by the fact that no nation appears to have\r\nundergone permanent sociological change as a result of improvement\r\nduring war. Many wartime changes carry on, of course; but they rarely\r\ncomprise, by the standards of the people concerned, improvements. The\r\nupswing is genuine, when it occurs, but it is rarely permanent, and it\r\nseldom affects all levels of the entire population with the same degree\r\nof exhilaration.\r\n\r\nThe propagandist thus has an ideal situation. In the enemy country\r\neveryone is trying to be more noble, more unselfish, more hard-working.\r\nEveryone applies a higher standard of ethics and performance than in\r\npeacetime. Businessmen are not supposed to make too much money,\r\npoliticians are supposed to work around the clock, officials are\r\nsupposed to cooperate, housewives to save, children to scavenge, and so\r\non. Yet a certain percentage of the enemy population is not taken into\r\nthis. Sometimes minorities feel themselves emotionally excluded; at\r\nother times private temperamental differences make some persons skeptic\r\nwhile others remain believers. The ground is ready for rumor, for\r\ntearing down inflated personages, for breaking the illusion by the\r\nsimple process of attributing normally selfish motives in wartime.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to attribute bad motives to civilian leaders than to\r\nmilitary. The ceremonialized discipline of modern warfare makes the\r\nmilitary figure a little mysterious; his normal peacetime obscurity\r\nshielded him and his family from exposure, cheap publicity, gossip. The\r\ncivilian leader does not have this protection. The very process of\r\nbecoming prominent has involved his seeking publicity, for the one part,\r\nand his pretense of avoiding it, for the other. Furthermore, the man who\r\nserves his nation serves himself. It is not possible for a man to lead a\r\nlarge country without benefiting himself, since the act of leadership is\r\nitself intensely pleasurable. Also, prominence possesses a\r\ncharacteristic of vice; even when it loses its value for positive\r\nenjoyment it retains withdrawal pains. The once-prominent individual\r\nhates to leave prominence though he may be genuinely weary of it. He is\r\nwilling to be tired of the country, but not willing for the country to\r\nbe tired of him. In wartime old leaders remain and new ones come in.\r\nFame and obscurity shift with even greater rapidity than before. The\r\npersonality-politics condition of the country is highly mobile.\r\nPersonalities are tense with interpersonal conflict.\r\n\r\nThen comes the propagandist.\r\n\r\nFirst, he attributes normal human motives to the leaders who so\r\nobviously possess them. In this job, he is doing what the famous little\r\nboy in the Hans Christian Andersen story did when he said of the\r\nEmperor, \"Mamma, he hasn't any clothes on!\" The propagandist need only\r\nsay what everyone knows: that this man is notoriously fond of money;\r\nthat another one has been a poor sportsman; that a third has betrayed\r\nsome old friends; that a fourth has sought power in a selfish,\r\nvindictive way. The response which the propagandist seeks is a simple\r\n\"That's so.\"\r\n\r\nThe next step in propaganda is to show that these persons do not measure\r\nup to the tragic, heroic, historic roles war has imposed on them. That\r\ntoo is not difficult, especially if the war is not going decisively one\r\nway or the other. Defeat or victory serves equally well to make leaders\r\ninto heroes; Churchill and MacArthur were never more splendid than when\r\nthey were whipped, the one after Dunkirk, the other after Bataan.\r\n\r\nThe final approach is the total discrediting of leaders. If the internal\r\npolitics of the country have been bitter enough, some of the leaders may\r\neven come over voluntarily to the enemy. Quisling in Norway; Wang in\r\nChina; Doriot and Laval in France; Vlassov in the U.S.S.R.; Laurel from\r\nthe Philippines--such men all possessed a certain amount of standing in\r\ntheir own countries but through capture, impatience, or seduction\r\ndecided to continue their careers with enemy backing. The propagandist\r\ncan now pretend to be tolerant. It is he who believes in peace, in\r\nreconciliation, in easygoing live-and-let-live attitudes. He describes\r\nhis protegés, the quislings, in warm complimentary terms; he lightens\r\nthe tenor of his attack on the non-quisling enemy leaders. He takes the\r\nattitude that war continues because of private stupidity, vengefulness,\r\ngreed, unreasonableness on the other. For his part, he is willing to let\r\nthe politicians, both quisling and patriot, \"settle it between\r\nthemselves.\" Let them form a coalition government.\r\n\r\nPersonal smearing is effective. If the war situation runs in the enemy's\r\nfavor, the easing of the enemy position permits the population the\r\nprivilege of backbiting, and even within the leader-group some leaders\r\nmay feel more free to destroy the positions or reputations of the\r\nothers. The impossible and foolishly heroic stances which the leaders\r\nhave taken in time of strain now make most of them look a little silly.\r\nConversely, in a downgrade situation, the leaders may gain stature in\r\nthe first tragic weeks of defeat, but soon the ignobility of defeat\r\nsweeps over them all. The propagandist need only be a good reporter, and\r\nthe leaders of the defeated country will provide him with good\r\npropaganda material.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the propaganda situation, the vulnerability of the leaders\r\nto personal attack is one of the major elements. Properly handled, it\r\ncan be of real value. In the American Revolution, the personal character\r\nof George Washington was a very substantial asset. A. very rich man, he\r\ncould scarcely be accused of a gutter revolution. A slave owner, he\r\ncould not be accused of wanting the overthrow of the social order. An\r\nexperienced soldier, he could not be attacked as a military amateur. A\r\nman of patience, correct manners, and genuine modesty, he was not easily\r\ndescribed as a bloody empire-builder, an immoral sycophant, or a\r\npower-drunk madman. British propaganda accordingly went after the\r\nContinental Congress, of which there was a great deal to be said. On the\r\nother side, the Americans had duck soup when it came to George III and\r\nmost of his Cabinet--personalities which included boors, fuddy-duddies,\r\ntoo-little-and-too-laters, and conspicuous nincompoops.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A Written Estimate of the Situation.= If, as indicated above, the\r\nterrain of Psychological Warfare consists of the private thoughts and\r\nfeelings of each member of the audience reached; if the mission of\r\nPsychological Warfare is the accomplishment of anything from entirely\r\nunknowable results (such as an imperceptible change of mood) all the way\r\nthrough to complete success (such as organized mass surrender); if the\r\ncapabilities of the enemy have virtually nothing to do with one's own\r\nPsychological Warfare commitments; and if the decision consists of\r\nchoices of means and theme--if these peculiarities all apply, the usual\r\n\"estimate of the situation\" has almost nothing to do with military\r\npropaganda.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, this is the case. An attempt to apply the outline\r\ngiven in FM 101-5, Appendix I, would produce only a lamentable parody of\r\na military document.\r\n\r\nThe _situation_ of the military unit possessing Psychological Warfare\r\nfacilities has relatively little to do with the _capabilities_ of the\r\nPsychological Warfare unit. The morale of one's own men should have no\r\neffect whatever on the output of the radio script writers and the\r\nleaflet writers.\r\n\r\nIn combat operations, military forces _meet_. In Psychological Warfare,\r\nthey do not. In combat operations, it is impossible for two hostile\r\nunits to occupy the _same_ territory for any length of time without both\r\nof them degenerating into a chaos of armed mobs. In Psychological\r\nWarfare operations, both sets of operations can be conducted in the same\r\nmedia, can address themselves to the same basic human appeals, can use\r\nthe same music, the same general kind of news account, and so on.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, no modern army ever went into operation with certain units\r\ndesignated as wholly and exclusively defensive, and certain others as\r\nwholly and exclusively offensive. (The Great Wall of China is the\r\nworld's most celebrated example of purely defensive planning, yet it\r\nprotected Chinese offensive bases for twenty-one hundred years.) But in\r\nPsychological Warfare, the Japanese-language short-wave broadcasts from\r\nSan Francisco had no imaginable effect on the American forces in the\r\nPacific. The only people who could understand them were the\r\nJapanese-language officers in G-2 and ONI offices; their personal\r\nvexation did not matter.\r\n\r\nThe offensive operations of combat troops are predicated upon finding\r\nthe enemy, effecting contact, and either destroying the enemy or making\r\nhim yield terrain. The defensive operations of combat troops,\r\ncontrariwise, are planned with a view to resisting an enemy who has been\r\nmet.\r\n\r\nIn Psychological Warfare, operators and enemy do not effect contact. The\r\naudience cannot strike back through a radio set; the enemy reader cannot\r\nthrow a leaflet back at the bomber which has dropped it on him. When\r\nAmerican planes bombed German radio stations, they did not do so because\r\nthe flight commander was trying to get German propaganda off the air;\r\nthey did so because the Americans were trying to break up the entire\r\nGerman communications network. It is almost impossible to pinpoint radio\r\ntransmitters and printing presses with such accuracy as to deny the\r\nenemy all chance of talking back. In a purely physical sense, there are\r\nonly two sets of measures whereby an actual defense can be set up\r\nagainst Psychological Warfare. Each is a measure of desperation; neither\r\nis considered effective; the Americans did not bother with either in\r\nWorld War II.\r\n\r\nThe first physical defense consists of radio jamming and of the planned\r\ninterception of enemy leaflet raids. Radio jamming is ineffectual except\r\nin the case of an enemy possessing hopelessly inferior signal equipment.\r\n(The Japanese tried to jam our radio at Saipan, just as the Germans\r\ntried to jam BBC. They impeded reception, but they never succeeded in\r\nblocking it out altogether.)\r\n\r\nThe second physical defense consists of destroying reception facilities.\r\nIt is possible to sweep an occupied territory and to sequester _almost_\r\nall the radio sets in use. It is possible to issue a military order that\r\nany soldier or civilian found in possession of enemy printed matter will\r\nbe court-martialed and punished. These measures are useful to dictators\r\nhaving secret police, and among armies having the Prussian level of\r\ndiscipline, with the enlisted men regarded as robots. It is not to be\r\nexpected that they would work against Americans.\r\n\r\nTherefore, propaganda does not meet propaganda. Combat forces _meet_;\r\nPsychological Warfare forces pass one another in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nIn American practice, the forces which countered enemy propaganda were\r\nthose pertaining to troop information and education--morale or special\r\nservices. These did not concern themselves with propaganda to the\r\nGermans and Japanese. In the German and Russian armies of World War II,\r\nbut not in the American, British, French or Japanese, there were\r\n_political officers_ attached to the units under a variety of titles;\r\nthese often took charge of propaganda to the enemy (offensive) as well\r\nas indoctrination of their own troops (defensive), but the unrelatedness\r\nof these two functions let them split apart.\r\n\r\nEven here, the parallel between combat operations and propaganda\r\noperations breaks down. Rarely does it occur that there is a simple\r\njuxtaposition of forces, thus:\r\n\r\n  _Enemy Propagandist_ ----> _Audience_ <---- _Own Propagandist_\r\n                             (_Troops_)\r\n\r\nThe issue is more commonly one in which the propagandist on each side\r\nattacks those troops which are retreating, cut off, suffering heavy\r\nlosses, politically disaffected, or otherwise psychologically promising\r\nmaterial for him. Of the factors which can affect troop or enemy morale,\r\nthe presence of friendly propaganda is a minor one. The result then\r\nbecomes complicated:\r\n\r\n  _Enemy Propagandist_              ----> _Exposed or Demoralized Units_\r\n\r\n  _Well Supplied and Well Informed Units_ <---- _Own Propagandist_\r\n\r\nTroops who are starving or are subjected to inordinate losses will not\r\nhave their propaganda-resistance heightened by pep talks. A chopped-up\r\nunit has no means of enjoying USO facilities.\r\n\r\nPropaganda vulnerability depends most commonly on the objective\r\nsituation of the audience. If the objective situation is good or\r\nneutral, one's own propaganda can supplement the good morale conditions,\r\nbut even here, it does not and should not meet enemy propaganda\r\nfrontally.\r\n\r\nIn so far as it can be tabulated, the visualizable propaganda situation\r\nat any given time would be something like this.\r\n\r\n                          ----------------------\r\n  Own Propaganda          |   _Own Audience_   |<---- Friendly\r\n  To Enemy Audience       | Actual Surroundings|      Propaganda\r\n                      \\   ----------------------_     To Home Audience\r\n                       \\                       |\\\r\n                        \\                        \\\r\n                        _\\|                       \\\r\n                           ---------------------\r\n  Enemy Propaganda   ----> |  _Enemy Audience_ |    Enemy\r\n  To Enemy Audience        |Actual Surroundings|    Propaganda To\r\n                           ---------------------    One's Own Side\r\n\r\nIn each of these instances, the propaganda operators are themselves\r\nmembers of an audience. Furthermore, propaganda leaks, as it were, out\r\nof the channels into which it is directed. Additionally, propaganda in\r\nall countries has to compete with the normal day-to-day preoccupations\r\nof the listener--his food, his health, his hour-by-hour activities, his\r\ntangible interpersonal relationships. Save for rare moments of intense\r\ncrisis, propaganda can expect to occupy only a small fraction of the\r\naudience's attention. In dictatorships, the range of propaganda can be\r\nwidened by polluting all news, all theater presentations, all churches,\r\netc., with the \"Party line,\" but visitors to totalitarian capitals--of\r\nboth the Fascist and Communist varieties--report that most of the common\r\npeople have become calloused with apathy, over-all disbelief, or\r\nskepticism as a result of overexposure to official indoctrination.\r\n\r\nHence a written estimate of the situation follows _not_ from some\r\nspecial Psychological Warfare situation, but from the practical measures\r\navailable. If desired, it can summarize the following points:\r\n\r\n  1. DEFINITION OF THE AUDIENCE\r\n    _a._ Medium through which reached\r\n    _b._ Anticipated attention (including means of getting attention)\r\n    _c._ Pertinent characteristics (from propaganda intelligence report)\r\n\r\n  2. PSYCHOLOGICAL GOALS TO BE SOUGHT\r\n    _a._ Attention of the enemy\r\n    _b._ Present-goal (if strategic, opinion or sentiment; if tactical,\r\n         action)\r\n    _c._ Ultimate goal (applicable to strategic only)\r\n\r\n  3. LIMITATIONS OF POLICY\r\n    _a._ National political limitations\r\n    _b._ Limitation by adverse factual situation\r\n    _c._ Limitations arising from one's own security\r\n\r\n  4. MEDIA AVAILABLE\r\n    _a._ Kind and quality of media to be used\r\n\r\n  5. THE PROPAGANDA MAN\r\n    _a._ Descriptive appreciation of a typical audience member\r\n\r\n  6. COMPETITIVE FACTORS\r\n    _a._ Listener's non-propaganda preoccupations\r\n    _b._ Continuation of adverse indoctrination\r\n    _c._ Effect of news available both to one's self and to listener\r\n    _d._ Competitive effect of hostile propaganda\r\n\r\n  7. RELATION TO GENERAL (MILITARY) ESTIMATE OF THE SITUATION\r\n    _a._ Timing relationships\r\n      _1._ Contingency plans\r\n      _2._ Contingency prohibitions\r\n    _b._ Contribution of Psychological Warfare to operations planning\r\n      _1._ Combat operations psychologically advisable\r\n      _2._ Combat operations subject to propaganda exploitation\r\n      _3._ Operations providing adverse propaganda with opportunity\r\n    _c._ Correlation of Psychological Warfare with\r\n      _1._ Public relations programming\r\n      _2._ Information and education plans\r\n      _3._ Medical plans and reporting\r\n      _4._ Countersubversive functions\r\n\r\nSuch papers might be of use, gathering together in a single document all\r\npertinent facts. In most tactical situations, the situation would have\r\nobsolesced before the author of the estimate had finished his document.\r\nIn strategic situations, it could not normally be made specific enough\r\nto be practical--at the operational level--without becoming hopelessly\r\nunwieldy. Each skill represented in the estimate does prepare other\r\nreports, and the practice of most modern armies indicates that it is\r\nbetter to conduct routine propaganda planning, supervision, and\r\nappreciation through liaison than to prepare elaborate documents\r\ngathering together the multifarious factors which actually affect\r\nPsychological Warfare.\r\n\r\nIn most American Psychological Warfare facilities--especially in the\r\ntheaters--the estimate of the situation consisted of a brief résumé of\r\nhome propaganda by the enemy (taken directly from propaganda analysis),\r\ncomment on the audience by appropriate representatives from the State\r\nDepartment or other Federal agencies, and discussion of the audience by\r\nsome kind of Psychological Warfare operations-planning and intelligence\r\nboard. Some of the most valuable suggestions came from persons not\r\nconcerned with propaganda--such as target-intelligence people who could\r\nanticipate enemy civilian or military shortages, or economic-warfare\r\npeople who suggested vexations which the enemy listener was probably\r\nexperiencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Question of Choice.= An estimate of a combat situation is something\r\nlike a diagnosis and prognosis in medicine. The estimate sets forth the\r\nsituation, presenting the difficulties to be faced and the general range\r\nof pertinent fact, all in orderly array, like a systematic diagnosis.\r\nThe plans are then drawn up in the light of the estimate; they are\r\nlimited by the harsh, immediate facts of the situation; they resemble a\r\ndoctor's prognosis, which may have room for several choices, but which\r\ndoes not open the way to speculative, creative action. Psychological\r\nWarfare situations are usually fluid, save at times of specific tactical\r\nemergency (the appeal to an enemy unit, when it is surrounded, to\r\nsurrender; pre-invasion propaganda for specific points).\r\n\r\nTherefore the psychological estimate should not be presented as a\r\npropaganda-_versus_-propaganda analysis; if it does, it will end as an\r\nunproductive and meaningless duel between the propagandists on the two\r\nsides. Nor should the estimate pretend to present choices with the\r\npretense that these choices are definitely prescribed by the situation\r\nitself. In any field, an expert can hoax or befuddle a layman. A\r\nPsychological Warfare officer should present choices for what they\r\nreally are--options open to him and his staff as creative writers.\r\nPolicy issues, in specific cases, can be answered _yes_ or _no_. This is\r\nnot true of propaganda as a whole. The task of the propagandist is to\r\ncreate something which will arouse attention, will induce attitudes, and\r\nwill eventually lead to action. It is a task of permanent offense. Its\r\nvariations are as infinitely diverse as the imaginations of mankind can\r\nmake them.\r\n\r\nChoice is perpetually before the Psychological Warfare propagandist. But\r\nit is the wide choice of what he can think up, not the narrow choice\r\ndictated by fixed terrain, by specific enemy capabilities, by concrete\r\nphysical necessities. Adolf Hitler himself, in the near-delirium of his\r\nlast days of life, recognized this. He told his followers to hold out;\r\nGerman propaganda might still provoke the \"inevitable\" American-Soviet\r\nclash which would save Germany. He said he would choose one side or the\r\nother--he didn't much care which. Thus, at the end, the range of\r\npropaganda possibilities deceived even the arch propagandist, despite\r\nthe bold shrewdness he had shown in the past. He knew, as his generals\r\ndid not, that in the realm of the psychological, the \"factor of the\r\nunexpected\" is always a large one, and hoped to the last to turn it to\r\nhis ends. His premises were right, even though his conclusion was fatal\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Allied Operations.= Estimates become more complex when several nations\r\nfight on the same side.\r\n\r\nIn a particular type of instance, estimates of the antagonist's\r\npropaganda capacity form a part of normal military operations. This\r\noccurs in the instance of allied operation: when the outside ally fears\r\nthat the local ally may be subverted. Such was the state of France in\r\nrelation to Britain in 1940, of Central China in relation to the\r\nAmericans in 1944, of the Balkan states in relation to the Third Reich\r\nin 1945. In such instances, estimate of the enemy propaganda becomes a\r\nvital part of the total military estimate. The principles stated below\r\ncan be applied by changing the direction of their application.\r\nPropaganda analysis can, in situations like this, provide cues for\r\neffective action and correct timing. In this type of situation, the\r\noutside ally cannot afford to sit by and hope for the best. By black\r\noperations he too must prepare to re-subvert the local ally if the local\r\nally goes over to the enemy. In Rumania, Bulgaria and puppet Serbia the\r\nGermans were not successful; in Italy they created the Fascist Italian\r\nSocial Republic and brought a large part of Northern Italy back into the\r\nwar. In China, Allied pro-Communist sympathizers hoped that the\r\nJapanese would subvert the Generalissimo so badly that America would\r\nbuild up Yenan as a precautionary measure; but the Generalissimo stood\r\nfirm, and the Yenan maneuver lingered on as an unpleasant memory between\r\ncertain Americans and certain Nationalist Chinese. This type of\r\nsituation mixes politics, economics, propaganda and warfare to such a\r\ndegree that no sound estimate can appraise one factor without including\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Estimate of One's Own Capacity.= In preparing a routine estimate of\r\none's own capacity, militarily speaking, the measurable factors of space\r\nand time provide guides for projecting plans into the future. It is\r\npossible to plan, \"At 1830 hours, D day plus 8, the Smithforce will have\r\narrived at Tenallytown,\" meaning that 8 days after the start, this\r\nresult can be expected. Psychological warfare can be estimated in a\r\nloosely comparable way, provided the terms of reference are different.\r\n\r\nNaturally, no sane Theater commander would rely on psychological warfare\r\nalone for the accomplishment of a military result. It is possible,\r\nnevertheless, to allow for planned good luck--good luck which one has\r\ncreated with many months of hard work. When psychological warfare is\r\nused in conjunction with invasion, its planned use (to judge by the\r\nresults found in World War II) might often justify commanders in using\r\nminimum rather than maximum allocations of troops for the protection of\r\nlines of communications against guerrilla or civilian attack. If the\r\nNazis had chased the Soviet peasants through the woods with soup\r\nkitchens, free movies, and mittens for the babies, they would not have\r\nhad so many furious partisans sniping at them.\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare can be relied upon to a considerable degree to\r\nstep up enemy panic in the application of a rapid forward movement. The\r\nJapanese in China panicked whole regiments of local volunteers plumb out\r\nof existence by the use of fast-marching Chinese-speaking plainclothes\r\ntroops, some of whom may have been air-dropped. In the Nazi\r\nestablishment of the first salient through to Abbeville, the\r\npsychological aspects of the blitzkrieg helped prevent the British and\r\nFrench from re-forming a continuous line and led eventually to the\r\npocketing of the British at Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare can also be counted on, tactically, to speed up\r\nthe reduction of isolated enemy positions when these positions are\r\nclearly beyond hope of rescue. All the psychological warfare people need\r\nto do is to go in with map leaflets, surrender leaflets, loudspeakers\r\nand a near-by radio. The unit may not give in instantly, but the unit\r\nwould be superhuman if it fought as well in the face of persuasion as it\r\nwould have fought without psychological attack. In the mopping-up of\r\nJapanese in the Pacific island fighting, psychological warfare teams and\r\ntechniques undoubtedly eased and speeded the process.\r\n\r\nThese references are to tactical estimates. Strategic propaganda is\r\nbeyond estimate. All it can do is to weight the probabilities a little\r\nmore favorably than would be the case without it. If the United States\r\nhad not dropped the Japanese surrender proposal in Japanese all over\r\nJapan, the Japanese government leaders might have been more inclined to\r\nresist surrendering. If the Germans had not softened up the French\r\nbefore the Great Western Blitz of 1940, they might have needed more\r\ntime, days or weeks more to reduce France, and thus might have faced a\r\nunited French overseas Empire even after France-in-Europe fell. The\r\nsuccess of a strategic propaganda operation cannot be guaranteed in any\r\nplan. It would be foolhardy optimism to think that psychology can assume\r\na major portion of responsibility for direct military results. It would\r\nappear that the Soviet Red Army, despite its propaganda-conscious\r\nCommunist background, never passed the whole buck to psychological\r\nwarfare. The Russians never appeared to leave the artillery at home in\r\norder to take the loudspeakers or leaflet mortars along. They made\r\nbrilliant, almost terrifying use of pre-belligerent propaganda; they\r\nused propaganda tactically with immense success in the taking of\r\nprisoners; they used psychological warfare, with a heavy infusion of\r\npolitical warfare, more drastically for consolidation and occupation\r\npurposes than did any of the other United Nations. But like everyone\r\nelse, they seem to have used strategic propaganda for whatever it might\r\nbring in--immediate generalized effect, and the ultimate production of\r\nwindfalls.\r\n\r\nTactical psychological warfare can be estimated, though to a limited\r\nextent, as part of a tactical potential of either the enemy or one's own\r\nside. Strategic propaganda can be planned and evaluated only in terms of\r\nthe diffuse general situation, with the reasonable and fair expectation\r\nthat if properly employed it will better the position of the user. It\r\nsometimes achieves results which astound even the originators, but these\r\nresults cannot be calculated (except by hunch) in advance. Nevertheless,\r\nthe operation is well worth trying since it has incalculable\r\npossibilities and is quite inexpensive in relation to the gross cost of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THREE\r\n\r\nPLANNING AND OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10\r\n\r\nOrganization for Psychological Warfare\r\n\r\n\r\nBig jobs require big organizations. Eight _billion_ leaflets were\r\ndropped in the Mediterranean and European Theaters of Operations alone\r\nunder General Eisenhower's command. That is enough to have given every\r\nman, woman and child on earth four leaflets, and this figure, large as\r\nit is, does not include leaflets dropped in all the other theaters of\r\nwar by ourselves, our allies, and our enemies. It does not include the\r\nB-29 leaflet raids on Japan, in which hundreds of tons of thin paper\r\nleaflets were dropped. Huge American newspapers were developed, edited,\r\nprinted and delivered to our Allies and to enemy troops. One of these,\r\n_Parachute News_ (_Rakkasan_), attained a circulation of two million\r\ncopies per run; this was in the Southwest Pacific. In parts of the upper\r\nBurmese jungle and the Tibetan borderland where no newspaper was ever\r\ndistributed before, the Fourteenth Air Force distributed a Japanese\r\nnewspaper, _Jisei_, along with picture sheets for illiterate tribesmen.\r\n\r\nIn getting at the enemy, the United States printed leaflets, cartoons,\r\npamphlets, newspapers, posters, books, magazines. In black operations\r\nenough fabrications were perpetrated to keep the FBI busy for a thousand\r\nyears. Movies in all forms (commercial, amateur, all known widths, sound\r\nand silent, even lantern slides) went out all over the world. Radio\r\ntalked on all waves in almost every language and code; loudspeakers,\r\nsouvenirs, candy, matches, nylon stockings, pistols you could hide in\r\nyour mouth, sewing thread, salt, phonograph records and baby pictures\r\nstreamed out over the world. Much of this was necessarily waste. In the\r\nlarger waste of war it appears almost frugal when taken in relation to\r\nthe results thought to have been achieved.\r\n\r\nEvery American theater commander, given the choice of using\r\npsychological warfare or not, as he chose, did choose to use it. Every\r\nmajor government engaged in the war used psychological warfare, along\r\nwith a number of assorted private characters, some of whom later founded\r\ngovernments. (The sacred government of the Dalai Lama, in forbidden\r\nLhasa, undertook a neat little maneuver in limited overt propaganda when\r\nit printed a brand-new set of stamps for presentation to President\r\nRoosevelt; the Inner Mongols were propagandized by the Outer Mongols;\r\nthe Grand Duchy of Luxembourg broadcast against the Reich.)\r\nPsychological warfare proliferated so much as to change the tone if not\r\nthe character of war. General Eisenhower wrote, at the end of the\r\nEuropean operations, that psychological warfare had developed as a\r\nspecific and effective weapon of war.\r\n\r\nThe organization of psychological warfare was as much a problem as the\r\noperation. It overlapped military, naval, diplomatic, press,\r\nentertainment, public relations, police power, espionage, commercial,\r\neducational and subversive operations. Almost every nation involved had\r\nextreme difficulty in fitting these new powers and unknown processes\r\ninto the accepted frame of government, and almost every national\r\nsolution was different. The British and the Japanese achieved a\r\nconsiderable degree of unification. The Americans, Nazis and Russians\r\nwere hampered by the number of competing agencies. The French were\r\nburdened through most of the war by an excess of governments. The\r\nChinese did things in their own formal but offhand manner; the\r\nNationalist party carried on information functions for the Chinese\r\ngovernment, while the Communist guerrilla authorities carried on\r\nfunctions for the Communist party.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 39: Leaflet Production: Military Presses._ The\r\nmachines shown are Davidson presses, widely used by the Americans in all\r\ntheaters of war. The unit shown is Psychological Warfare Branch during\r\nthe Leyte operations. The leaflet being run off is addressed to both\r\nFilipino guerrillas and Japanese troops, facilitating a difficult\r\nthree-way operations whereby Japanese are told to surrender to\r\nFilipinos, Filipinos told not to kill surrendering Japanese, and\r\nAmericans instructed to receive prisoners from Filipinos.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 40: Leaflet Production: Rolling._ When round\r\nbombs were used, the leaflets had to be rolled into round packages to\r\nfit. Forty thousand leaflets could be packed into one bomb, and a\r\nMitchell bomber could carry seventeen such bombs. (Photo by Ninth Air\r\nForce Combat Camera Unit.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 41: Leaflet Distribution: Attaching Fuzes._\r\nPackaged leaflets must spread out. Bundles of paper which fall intact\r\nmake little impact on the enemy unless they hit him on the head. Their\r\nsubsequent employment is rarely related to propaganda. To be effective,\r\nleaflets must scatter. World War II saw the adaptation of various\r\nscattering devices, of which the most effective was the barometric fuze,\r\nshown here. The others included self-timing packages, slip-strings which\r\nunwrapped the package in the air, and a belly-tank which fed leaflets\r\nout at any desired speed, either in a continuous stream or in bursts.]\r\n\r\nThe lower down the echelon, the nearer the armies of the world came to\r\nstandardizing psychological warfare organization. They did this for the\r\nsame reason that they all organize into regiments instead of centuries,\r\ncohorts, or tribes. Modern war is a self-standardizing process if the\r\nenemy experience is to be copied, enemy techniques improved, allied\r\nassistance accepted, and military practice kept up to world standards.\r\nPsychological warfare units needed printing and radio sections; to\r\nservice these sections they all needed intelligence and analysis\r\noffices; to distribute their materials they all needed agents and\r\nliaison. Black propaganda organization varied more than did white, but\r\nit was amazing to Americans, uncovering Japanese subversive-operations\r\nunits, to see how much the Japanese organization resembled their own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 42: Leaflet Distribution: Packing the Boxes._\r\nSometimes boxes were used instead of bombs. These, being square,\r\nfacilitated the packing process, since the rectangular packages could be\r\nused just as they came out of the printshop. The fuze is attached to the\r\npackage, not to the box.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 43: Leaflet Distribution: Loading the Boxes._\r\nBoxes were built to fit the bomb bays. Boxes were opened, one after the\r\nother, by a trip lever, shown above at left. Each box can be emptied in\r\nturn, giving the pilot the opportunity to select more than one target.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 44: Leaflet Distribution: Bombs at the Airfield._\r\nLeaflet bombs, filled with rolls such as those shown in figure 40, are\r\ndelivered to the bomber. The scene shown is somewhere in England.\r\nOfficers and men picked up British slang for leaflet operations, and\r\ncalled such missions \"nickelling.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 45: Leaflet Distribution: Loading the Bombs._ The\r\nbombs were loaded as shown. The entire bomb dropped out of the plane and\r\nwas disintegrated in the air by a small explosive charge. No\r\nillustration can do justice to the sight of such a bomb in the actual\r\ndropping, since the leaflets tend to look scattered or to disappear\r\nunder normal flight conditions. Army motion picture films preserve the\r\nprocess for the official record, however.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 46: Leaflet Distribution: The Final Result._\r\nSearch of prisoners provided a fair, accurate test of how the leaflets\r\ntook effect. Sometimes surrender leaflets actually came to have black\r\nmarket value. Enemy officers prohibited the carrying of Allied surrender\r\nleaflets, since they knew that a soldier who had one in his pocket or\r\nhidden in his clothes was halfway or more through the psychological\r\nprocess of surrendering. Here a German hands in a leaflet to his\r\nAmerican captor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=National Propaganda Organizations.= At the national level, the\r\npsychological warfare facilities were parts of their national\r\ngovernments. Neither the Axis nor the United Nations developed\r\nsuper-national psychological facilities. The closest thing to\r\ninternational agencies were the American-British coordination facilities\r\nunder authority of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, along with that\r\nmysterious force which in the latter part of the war impelled\r\nRussian-occupied countries to sound amazingly much like Moscow. Short of\r\npreparing a textbook for political science study, explaining each of the\r\ngovernments and the location of its intelligence and informational\r\nfunctions, it would be impossible to explain in any detail how each of\r\nthe systems worked. Even between governments having the same general\r\npolitical orientation, the improvised war agencies were different, and\r\nin the same government, the practices of World War I were not carried\r\nover into World War II. Some description of the American psychological\r\nwarfare may be warranted, chiefly as a means of showing how a simple\r\ntask can be accomplished even with intricate and confused organizations,\r\nand the Japanese system (on paper, the best of them all, though weak in\r\nfield operations and control) may be outlined for the sake of contrast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 47: Consolidation Propaganda: The Movie Van._\r\nConsolidation of friendly, neutral or hostile civilians in an area of\r\noperations can become a vitally important function. During the North\r\nAfrican operations, this movie van showed newsreels and documentary\r\nfilms to the local people. Similar vans were used in Italy, France,\r\nHolland, Belgium, Germany, Austria, and other areas.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=American Psychological Warfare Agencies.= The American Army failed to\r\nestablish its authority and leadership in the field of psychological\r\nwarfare despite its creation of the Psychological Warfare Branch under\r\nG-2. In large part this was a matter of practical politics and of\r\npersonalities. The United States government as a whole, in the\r\nsuccessive administrations of President Roosevelt, acquired tremendous\r\nadministrative vitality but at the same time permitted the older\r\n\"constitutional\" agencies to lose ground to their newly founded rivals.\r\nHad an administrative purist and traditionalist been in the White House,\r\ninstead of a bold governmental experimenter, the logical creation of a\r\npsychological warfare facility would have paralleled the later creation\r\nof SWNCC (State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee).\r\n\r\nFrom the purely theoretical standpoint, it would have been far sounder\r\nto put national policy formulation (White House and Congress), foreign\r\npolicy formulation (State), strategic propaganda (State, War, Navy) into\r\na single administrative entity than to create a new federal agency with\r\nimprovised procedures, improvised security, and an improvised staff.\r\nHowever, the State, War and Navy Departments (at the very opening of our\r\nwar) were overworked and understaffed. Many of the senior personnel\r\nregarded psychological warfare with downright suspicion and propaganda\r\nwas regarded as a dirty name for a dirty and ineffectual job. Hence the\r\nold-line agencies let pass the opportunity for establishing initial\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 48: Consolidation Propaganda: Posters._ An\r\nAmerican soldier pastes American posters over Nazi ones while a French\r\ncrowd looks on. (The crowd is pretty typical as to size and content, but\r\na thousand such crowds will cover an entire town.) The poster operation\r\nshown was conducted by Psychological Warfare Division of SHAEF. (OWI-PWD\r\nphoto.)]\r\n\r\nSubsequent experience suggests that the use of existing facilities and\r\nexisting agencies wherever possible instead of new ones imparts\r\nstability, discipline, and morale, and lowers the organizational\r\nfriction common to all new political agencies, especially to\r\ninstrumentalities in so controversial a field as propaganda. On the\r\nchart shown, for instance, it would not have mattered whether the\r\nPsychological Warfare Facility (whatever its name) were put for\r\nhousekeeping purposes under the State, War, Navy Department, or the\r\nOffice for Emergency Management. The essential requirement would have\r\nbeen to use State Department men for jobs that involved determining\r\nforeign policy, military men for tasks of a military nature and naval\r\nfor navy work, and to recruit only after cadres had been established.\r\nThe sponsorship of psychological warfare by one--any one--of the\r\nold-line departments might have slowed down the feverish tempo of\r\nreorganizations, quarrels, cabals, internal struggles for power and\r\nclashes with other Federal agencies which were so characteristic of OWI\r\nand its colleague organizations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 49: Consolidation Propaganda: Photo Exhibit._\r\nWhen newsprint is short, a photo exhibit has great appeal to civilians.\r\nIn backward countries, people sometimes waited their turn to get a\r\nchance to see the American pictures. Even in Cherbourg, the French city\r\nshown, these passersby are showing a very real interest in the picture\r\ndisplay.]\r\n\r\nThe actual conduct of psychological warfare was shown in Chart I. (No\r\nofficial authority exists for such a chart; the author bases it on his\r\nown observation and experience.) Only agencies themselves originating\r\npsychological warfare materials are shown. Relationships between State,\r\nWar and Navy were stable, but were frequently by-passed; for example,\r\nthe Zacharias broadcasts, which were our biggest political warfare\r\nexperiment, did not go to the State Department until after they had\r\nstarted. Relationships between OSS and other agencies were erratic and\r\ncloaked in extraordinary but irregular security. The OWI ran for most\r\npurposes as an autonomous group, with occasional reference to State,\r\nNavy, and War Departments. The President in his individually official\r\ncapacity was apt to improvise psychological warfare operations of high\r\nimportance, without warning his subordinates of what was coming (paper\r\nknife made of human Japanese bone; the \"unconditional surrender\"\r\nformula). The White House staff sometimes worked through channels,\r\nsometimes not; the Harvard professor who advised on inflation was\r\nsimultaneously involved with psychological warfare on continental Asia.\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury openly discussed what _he_ would like to\r\ndo with Germany in terms which the Nazi radio naturally conveyed to its\r\nown people. Within the OWI itself, the overseas operation was separated\r\nfrom the domestic, the broadcasters from the planners, the outposts\r\nfrom everybody else, during much of the war.\r\n\r\nBut the job was done!\r\n\r\nSuccess was not due to the formal structure of the Office of War\r\nInformation (see charts V, VI). No administrative formula could have\r\ntranscended such governmental confusion. It was owing to the fact that\r\nall the people just described--who went around, with the best will in\r\nthe world most of the time, minding one another's business--did in the\r\nend achieve effective results. The common denominator behind them was\r\nnot the authority of the President, the discipline of the Democratic\r\nParty, or the casually designed, casually overlooked formal lines of\r\nauthority. The common denominator was American civilization itself. Had\r\nwe been deeply disunited, this ramshackle structure would have collapsed\r\ninto chaos. But there was broad concurrence, a sense of cooperativeness,\r\ngood will and good temper. A German, Russian or Japanese bureaucrat\r\nwould have gone mad in the wartime mazes of the Federal system; a\r\nChinese would probably have felt very much at home, but would have\r\npolished up the titles and honorifics a little.\r\n\r\nThe difference between our governmental organization and that of our\r\nenemies lay in the fact that to us the T/O were something that could be\r\nused when convenient, and could (without breach of faith or law) be\r\nshort-circuited when convenient. Word was passed around, material\r\nexchanged, coordination effected in ways which could not be shown on any\r\nimaginable chart. It was neither a merit nor a defect, but simply an\r\nAmerican way of doing things.\r\n\r\nThis characteristic has the effect, however, of making after-the-fact\r\nstudies quite unrealistic. There is not much from the formal records and\r\nthe formal charts which conveys the actual tone of governmental\r\noperations in terms of propaganda. Study of World War II organization\r\nfor the sake of research and planning against possible future war would\r\nnot be very profitable unless it delved into the concrete experience of\r\nindividuals. The formal outlines mean nothing; they are positively\r\ndeceptive unless the actual controls and operations are known. (Mr.\r\nWarburg makes it plain in his book that he thinks little of Mr. Elmer\r\nDavis' conception of his job; but he does not mention that Mr. Sherwood,\r\ntheoretically Mr. Davis' subordinate, ran foreign operations without\r\nmuch reference to Mr. Davis or to any other part of the Federal\r\ngovernment. Since Mr. Sherwood was closer to the White House than was\r\nMr. Davis, this important consideration escapes being recorded on the\r\nchart: foreign operations were actually autonomous.[35]) Examples of how\r\nthings really worked--as opposed to how they looked as though they\r\nworked--could be multiplied forever; but the soundest way of finding out\r\nsober, judicious opinion will necessarily await the writing of\r\nautobiographies and memoirs by the people concerned.\r\n\r\nWith these sweeping reservations in mind, it is worth noting the\r\norganization of OWI (internal). The Domestic Operations Branch can be\r\ndismissed with brief mention. It proved to be the object of profound\r\nsuspicion on the part of many members of Congress, and its function was\r\nto stimulate and assist inward media of public information in support of\r\nthe war effort. The Domestic Operations Branch never superseded other U.\r\nS. government informational services (State, Agriculture, Treasury, War,\r\nand so on), so that it was the wartime supplement to the governmental\r\nsupplement to the regular news and information system, which remained\r\nprivate. This precluded intimate coordination of domestic and overseas\r\npropaganda and rendered illusory any hope that domestic propaganda, as\r\neavesdropped by our enemies, could be used as an instrument of war.\r\n\r\nThe Overseas Operations Branch had two basic missions. Within the United\r\nStates it was the operating and controlling agency for government-owned\r\nor government-leased world-wide short-wave. For actual overseas\r\npurposes, it was the rear echelon of both the Navy and Army theater\r\nfacilities and of its own OWI Outposts. The Outposts were themselves\r\nunder OWI for certain purposes; for other purposes they were subject to\r\nthe chief of mission (ambassador, minister or chargé) of the U. S. in\r\nthe foreign country, and still other purposes under the American\r\nmilitary commander having local jurisdiction. (OWI-Delhi, for example,\r\nwas under the office of the American High Commissioner in India; also\r\nunder the Rear Echelon Headquarters of the Commanding General, United\r\nStates Army Forces, China-Burma-India Theater; also under OWI-New York\r\nfor supply of its printed materials, most personnel and needed presses;\r\nunder OWI-San Francisco for supply of its wirelessed news; and under\r\nOWI-Washington for general policy, hiring and firing, and everything\r\nelse.)\r\n\r\nIn terms of its own global radio, OWI prepared planning and control\r\nmaterials in Washington and relayed these to New York and San Francisco.\r\nThe radio facilities in these cities then transmitted the material\r\noverseas. Through the first three years of the war, the precise nature\r\nof the Washington controls was in question, enforcement remained a\r\nperplexing problem, and coordination between planning and execution\r\nremained unsolved in part. By the spring and summer of 1945, OWI had\r\nsolved most of these problems, chiefly by means of circulating the Area\r\nI, II, and III chiefs to the operating offices. When personal relations\r\nwere satisfactory (as in the instance of Mr. Owen Lattimore, chief in\r\nOWI San Francisco, Mr. George Taylor, chief of Far East in Washington,\r\nand Mr. F. M. Fisher, chief of China Outpost in Chungking, all of them\r\nChina experts) coordination might be difficult but was never\r\nexasperating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chart V_\r\n\r\n                           +----------------------+\r\n                           |   DOMESTIC BRANCH    |\r\n  +--------------------+   +- - - - - - - - - - - +    +-----------------+\r\n  |  ASSISTANT TO THE  +---+       DIRECTOR       +----+     SPECIAL     |\r\n  |      DIRECTOR      |   + - - - - - - - - - - -+    |    ASSISTANT    |\r\n  +--------------------+   |  EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR  |    +-----------------+\r\n                           +----------+-----------+\r\n                                      |\r\n                +---------------------+------------------------+\r\n                |                     |                        |\r\n     +----------+-----------+         |  +- - - - + +----------+---------+\r\n     |       ASSISTANT      |         |  |PROGRAM | |     DIRECTOR       |\r\n     |       DIRECTOR       |         |   PLANNING  |  OF WAR PROGRAMS   |\r\n     +----------------------+         |  |  AND   | +--------------------+\r\n     | Speech Clearance Unit|         |    REVIEW   |      Industry      |\r\n     |                      |         |  | BOARD  | |  Liaison Officer   |\r\n     |     Inter-Agency     |         |  + - - - -+ |                    |\r\n     |     Publications     |         |             |   Scheduling and   |\r\n     |    Committee Unit    |         |             | Allocation Officer |\r\n     +- - - - - - - - - - - +         |             |                    |\r\n     |  Advisory Committee  |         |             |    Copy Editor     |\r\n     +----------------------+         |             +--------------------+\r\n                                      |\r\n                                      |\r\n       +-----------+-----------+------+------+----------+-----------+\r\n       |           |           |      |      |          |           |\r\n  +----+----+ +----+----+ +----+----+ | +----+---+ +----+-----+ +---+----+\r\n  |  DEPUTY | |  DEPUTY | |  DEPUTY | | | DEPUTY | |  DEPUTY  | | DEPUTY |\r\n  | DIRECTOR| | DIRECTOR| | DIRECTOR| | |DIRECTOR| | DIRECTOR | |DIRECTOR|\r\n  |  -----  | |  -----  | |  -----  | | | -----  | |  ------  | |  ----  |\r\n  | ECONOMIC| |         | |         | | |        | |          | |        |\r\n  | STABIL- | |         | |  LABOR  | | |        | |PRODUCTION| |        |\r\n  | IZATION | | FOREIGN | |   AND   | | |MILITARY| |   AND    | |  WAR   |\r\n  | FINANCE | |RELATIONS| | CIVILIAN| | |        | | MANPOWER | |  FOOD  |\r\n  |   AND   | |         | | WELFARE | | |        | |          | |        |\r\n  | TAXATION| |         | |         | | |        | |          | |        |\r\n  |  -----  | |  -----  | |  -----  | | | -----  | |  ------  | |  ----  |\r\n  | PROGRAM | | PROGRAM | | PROGRAM | | |PROGRAM | |  PROGRAM | |PROGRAM |\r\n  | MANAGERS| | MANAGERS| | MANAGERS| | |MANAGERS| | MANAGERS | |MANAGERS|\r\n  +---------+ +---------+ +---------+ | +--------+ +----------+ +--------+\r\n                                      |\r\n      +----------+---------+----------+--------+--------+---------+\r\n      |          |         |          |        |        |         |\r\n  +---+----+ +---+---+ +---+----+ +---+---+ +--+---+ +--+---+ +---+---+\r\n  |BOOK AND| |FOREIGN| |        | |MOTION | |      | |      | |SPECIAL|\r\n  |MAGAZINE| | NEWS  | |GRAPHICS| |PICTURE| | NEWS | |RADIO | |SERVICE|\r\n  | BUREAU | |BUREAU | | BUREAU | |BUREAU | |BUREAU| |BUREAU| |BUREAU |\r\n  +--------+ +-------+ +--------+ +-------+ +------+ +------+ +-------+\r\n\r\n(Source: OWI administrative memorandum.

Foreign demands for American materials were\r\nunpredictable. The OWI learned rapidly and effectively, and the material\r\ngoing out of the outposts to foreign audiences very soon reached a high\r\nlevel of quality.\r\n\r\nOther psychological warfare agencies at the national level were the CIAA\r\n(Coordinator of [later the Office of] Inter-American Affairs) which\r\nconducted propaganda exclusively to Latin America and the Caribbean, and\r\nthe OSS (Office of Strategic Services), which serviced the Joint Chiefs\r\nof Staff with intelligence and policy materials, and served as a home\r\nbase for its own units which operated abroad under Theater authority. No\r\nU.S.-based black propaganda operations were reported to the public.[36]\r\n\r\nReduced to the concrete terms of definite policy execution (as opposed\r\nto the making of policies that might or might not ever reach their\r\nsupposed executors) and the routine working of operations, the national\r\nlevel was not important except for the two functions stated above,\r\nglobal shortwave, and source of supply. The decisive choices were made\r\nin the theaters or at the outposts, half the time in ignorance of what\r\nWashington policy-makers had decided in conclave on that particular\r\ntopic. (When the author was in China, he found that the OWI China\r\noutpost decoded its week-to-week propaganda instructions only after they\r\nwere hopelessly obsolete; they were then filed.) The theaters were able\r\nto use psychological warfare as and when they pleased. Between the ETO\r\nand Washington close politico-military coordination was possible.\r\nBetween Washington and the others it was impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe War Department participation in the control and planning of\r\npsychological warfare is shown by Chart VII, which represents the\r\nsituation as of 1945. The Propaganda Branch, attached to G-2 as a staff\r\nagency and not to Military Intelligence Service as an operating agency,\r\nserved to carry out the psychological warfare functions of the War\r\nDepartment.[37] The Chief of the Branch represented the Joint Chiefs of\r\nStaff at OWI meetings, along with his Navy confrère; he took care of\r\nofficial messages to the Theaters pertaining to psychological warfare\r\nmatters, and his office itself performed a few limited functions. (One\r\nof these functions required the author to get up at four-thirty mornings\r\nin order to digest the overnight intake of enemy propaganda. He was\r\njoined in this by Teheran-born, Columbia-trained Edward K. Merat. It was\r\nwith real relief that he saw the Nazi stations go off the air. He was\r\nthen able to pass the early-bird business to his Persian colleague.) The\r\nBranch also made up propanal studies whenever these were warrantable at\r\nthe General Staff level. The Deputy Chief (Air) was the vestigial\r\nremnant of a short-lived Army Air Forces propaganda establishment; he\r\nhad direct access to the air staff, and took care of things having a\r\npeculiarly air character. (The abbreviations under Theaters are\r\nexplained below, on page 187, since Theater nomenclature for\r\npsychological warfare was never standardized.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chart VII_\r\n\r\n  +--------------+                                    +----------------+\r\n  | JOINT CHIEFS +------------------------------------+ CHIEF OF STAFF |\r\n  |   OF STAFF   |                                    +--------+-------+\r\n  +------+-------+                                             |\r\n         |         +-----------+                               |\r\n         |         |  CG 20TH  |                               |\r\n         +- - - - -+ AIR FORCE +- - - - +    +-----------------+\r\n         |         +-----------+        |    |                 |\r\n         |                                   |                 |\r\n         |                              |    |                 |\r\n  +------+-----+                +-------+----+----+       +----+--------+\r\n  | JOINT STAFF|                |   HEADQUARTERS  |       | A.

By\r\nexecutive order of 20 September 1945, effective ten days later, OSS was\r\nbroken up; the scholastic portions were dismembered and reassembled into\r\nthe Department of State, where they presumably helped collate material\r\nfor the new interdepartmental Central Intelligence Group (CIG). The\r\noperational parts were handed over to the War Department. For all the\r\nauthor knows, some distressed colonel may have a desk full of\r\nfountain-pens which explode, transmit radio messages, or can be used for\r\ninvisible tattooing, along with an edible blotter, a desk telephone\r\nwhich is really a hand grenade and a typewriter which is a demountable\r\nmotor scooter; such speculations are delightful topics on which to\r\ndwell, but the day of black propaganda is over. Obsolescence reduces all\r\nthings, even OSS, to absurdity.\r\n\r\nThe OWI perished a more lingering administrative death. It was\r\ntransferred to the Department of State as an operating unit under the\r\nname Interim International Information Service (IIIS) and a new\r\nAssistant Secretary of State, Mr. William Benton, took over its\r\nsponsorship. Later, under the abbreviation OIC (Office of International\r\nInformation and Cultural Affairs), it was coordinated on January 1,\r\n1946, with preexisting State department offices and with certain\r\nleftovers from the Office of Inter-American Affairs (OIAA). It retained\r\nthe global broadcasts on a limited budget; it still served the surviving\r\noutposts, which were being integrated with diplomatic and consular\r\noffices overseas; and for Korea, Japan, Germany, Austria, and Venezia\r\nGiulia, it acted as the supplying service for the Military Government\r\ninformation programs in those areas. The Bureau of the Budget took over\r\nlimited domestic functions when the OWI passed out of independent\r\nexistence on 31 August 1945.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The _Joho Kyoku_.= Comparison of this United States system with the\r\nJapanese Board of Information (_Joho Kyoku_), as outlined in chart VIII,\r\nshows the difference between integrated and disparate systems. The\r\nJapanese developed a close-knit system which combined public relations\r\nof both army and navy, all domestic government publishing, complete\r\ncontrol of book-publishing, magazines, press, radio, and film,\r\npropaganda intelligence and over-all psychological warfare. The progress\r\nof an item through the Japanese psychological warfare system may look\r\nintricate when followed on the chart, but it was in fact much less\r\nintricate than the comparable American processing of an item.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chart VIII_\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------+         +----------------------+\r\n  |            SECRETARIAT           |         | BOARD OF INFORMATION |\r\n  |            SOSAI-KAMBO           |         |      JOHO KYOKU      |\r\n  |                                  |         |                      |\r\n  |INVESTIGATION OFFICE SHINGISHITSU +---------+      PRESIDENT       |\r\n  | PLANS INFORMATION AND PROPAGANDA |         |    VICE PRESIDENT    |\r\n  | SECRETARIAL SECTION - HISHO-KA   |         |    COUNCIL MEMBERS   |\r\n  | DIRECTOR                         |         +-----------+----------+\r\n  | PROTOCOL SECTION - BUSHO-KA      |                     |\r\n  | DIRECTOR                         |                     |\r\n  | ACCOUNTS SECTION - KAIKEI-KA     |                     |\r\n  |                                  |                     |\r\n  |WARTIME DATA OFFICE -             |                     |\r\n  | SENJI SHIRYOSHITSU               |                     |\r\n  | 1st SECTION - DOMESTIC AFFAIRS   |                     |\r\n  | 2nd SECTION - FOREIGN AFFAIRS    |                     |\r\n  +----------------------------------+                     |\r\n                                                           |\r\n             +-------------------------+-------------------+-----+\r\n             |                         |                         |\r\n  +----------+--------+ +-------------+-------------+ +---------+---------+\r\n  |   FIRST DIVISION  | |      SECOND DIVISION      | |   THIRD DIVISION  |\r\n  |     DAIICHI-BU    | |         DAINI-BU          | |      DAISAN-BU    |\r\n  |                   | |                           | |                   |\r\n  |   DIRECTOR        | |   DIRECTOR                | |   DIRECTOR        |\r\n  |   VICE DIRECTOR   | |                           | |                   |\r\n  |                   | |1st SECTION - DIRECTOR     | |1st SECTION -      |\r\n  |1st SECTION -      | |  GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENTS,| |   DIRECTOR        |\r\n  |   DIRECTOR        | |  NEWSPAPER COMMUNICATIONS,| |  REPORTS FOREIGN  |\r\n  |  WAR GUIDANCE AND | |  EXPOSITIONS, EXHIBITIONS | |  DEVELOPMENTS;    |\r\n  |  PROPAGANDA       | |                           | |  NEWS FROM FOREIGN|\r\n  |  PLANNING         | |2nd SECTION - DIRECTOR     | |  NEWSPAPERS,      |\r\n  |                   | |  RADIO BRODCASTS, MOTION  | |  DIRECTS OVERSEAS |\r\n  |2nd SECTION - CHIEF| |  PICTURES, DRAMA, MUSIC,  | |  BROADCASTS       |\r\n  |  ENFORCEMENT OF   | |  ETC.                     | |                   |\r\n  |  PLANNING AND     | |                           | |2nd SECTION -      |\r\n  |  PUBLIC RELATIONS | |3rd SECTION - DIRECTOR     | |   DIRECTOR        |\r\n  |  CONTROL          | |  MAGAZINE PUBLICATIONS,   | |  OVERSEAS CULTURAL|\r\n  +-------------------+ |  ART WORK, PHOTOGRAPHS    | |  WORK AND         |\r\n                        |                           | |  PROPAGANDA       |\r\n                        |  EDITORIAL OFFICE - CHIEF | +-------------------+\r\n                        |  PUBLISH WEEKLY NEWS      |\r\n                        |  AND PICTORIAL REVIEWS.   |\r\n                        |                           |\r\n                        |4th SECTION - DIRECTOR     |\r\n                        |  CENSORSHIP               |\r\n                        +-------------+-------------+\r\n                                      |\r\n                                      |\r\n                               +------+------+\r\n                               |    OUTPUT   |\r\n                               +-------------+\r\n\r\n(Source: Chart prepared before VJ-day in Propaganda Branch, G-2.)]\r\n\r\nThe only aspect of psychological warfare that does not show on the chart\r\nis the Japanese political warfare system--by the test of success, the\r\nbest developed by any belligerent during World War II. The Japanese very\r\nearly learned the simple rule: _Political warfare cannot convert a\r\nsub-subsistence economy and government into a satisfactory system, but\r\npolitical warfare can convert a subsisting area into one that has the\r\nillusions of prosperity and national freedom._ To succeed in the face of\r\neconomic difficulty, political warfare must be shrewd, simple,\r\ninsistent, and backed up with a touch of terror. The Japanese moved into\r\nthe Western colonial areas of the Far East between 1940 and 1942\r\n(Indo-China, Malaya, Indonesia, the Philippines, parts of China, Burma,\r\nand areas inhabited by substantial Indian minorities). They organized\r\nthe following \"independent\" governments:\r\n\r\n  The Imperial Government of Manchukuo;\r\n\r\n  Federated Autonomous Inner Mongolia;\r\n\r\n  The Reorganized National Government of China, superseding earlier\r\n  puppets;\r\n\r\n  Malai (under Japanese military control but promised ultimate\r\n  independence);\r\n\r\n  The Republic of the Philippines;\r\n\r\n  The Empire of Vietnam (later the Vietnam Republic);\r\n\r\n  A dictatorship in Burma of the Adipadi;\r\n\r\n  Republic Indonesia;\r\n\r\n  Azad Hind (Free Indian government-in-exile) and the Azad Hind Fauj\r\n  (quisling Indian National Army, which put large forces into the field\r\n  against British-controlled Indian troops and helped to neutralize the\r\n  entire military potential of India);\r\n\r\n  The independent Kingdom of Cambodia (made independent by telling the\r\n  helpless King that he need not let the French come back).\r\n\r\nThese Japanese-sponsored governments flew their own flags, had enough\r\ntroops to help Japan police their home areas, developed psychological\r\nwarfare facilities with intensive Japanese assistance, and went through\r\nall the motions of independence. In 1944, some of them even held an\r\ninternational conference at Tokyo, thanking Japan for liberating all the\r\nnon-White States and adopting high-sounding resolutions. (The Siamese\r\npuppet ambassador to this meeting had the unforgettable name of His\r\nExcellency, the Honorable Witchit Witchit Watakan!)\r\n\r\nBehind the pageantries of Japanese political warfare, economic and\r\nsocial realities were horrid. The Japanese printed money which had far\r\nless backing than cigar store coupons. They bankrupted all non-Japanese\r\nbusiness so that Japanese carpetbaggers could buy their way in cheap;\r\nbusinesses owned by white foreigners were expropriated out of hand. They\r\ncut off communications, spread terror, raised the price of food, put\r\nhospitals out of business, degraded schools--and received the devoted\r\nloyalty of large parts of the cheated populations. It did not matter to\r\nmillions of Burmese whether they had lived well under British rule or\r\nnot; the British did not let them have their own flag, did not let them\r\nsend ministers and ambassadors, did not let them run a scow up and down\r\nthe river with a mortar on it, calling it a navy. The _miranda_, the\r\npageantry of politics, was what mattered--not law-and-order, democracy,\r\nsecurity, education, health.[38]\r\n\r\nThe same story might have been repeated on a larger scale throughout the\r\nFar East, perhaps ultimately leading to something like Lothrop\r\nStoddard's old nightmare, _The Rising Tide of Color_. Countervening\r\nfactors included the presence of Chinese agitation both Kuomintang and\r\nCommunist in leadership, guerrilla operations throughout Southeast Asia,\r\nand the ruinous economic effects of American submarine and Fourteenth\r\nAir Force anti-shipping operations. Shipping losses drove the Greater\r\nEast Asia Co-prosperity Sphere below subsistence level and created a\r\ncondition where even the most fanatic patriot realized the disadvantages\r\nof the situation.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese put all the captured radios to work. They had traitors of\r\nall kinds on their side--including, it is shameful to admit, Americans,\r\nRussians, British, Australians, and French. (Despite the fact they\r\noccupied all of Guam, they never used a single Guamanian\r\ntraitor--testimony to the simple loyalty to the U.S. of the Chamorro\r\npeople and to the popularity of the long-established U.S. naval\r\ngovernment on the island.)\r\n\r\nJapanese psychological warfare failed because the real warfare behind it\r\nfailed. The Japanese could not whip their over-docile troops into a\r\nfighting frenzy without allowing those troops to behave in a way which\r\nmade deadly enemies for Japan among the peoples she came to \"liberate.\"\r\nThe Japanese did not have sense enough to be satisfied with 100% return\r\nper year on their money, but wrecked the conquered economic systems with\r\ninflation, poor management, and excess exploitation. Even the quislings\r\nbecame restless under the poor occupation policies of the Japanese, and\r\nbefore the war was over a considerable number of the Japanese quislings\r\nre-quislinged back to the United Nations side.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Theater Psychological Warfare.= The Japanese had superlative close-knit\r\npsychological warfare staff organization within metropolitan Japan. They\r\npossessed many first-class field operators, first among them the\r\ntrue-life master-mind Major General K. Doihara, whose dinner guests\r\noften woke up the next morning with bad hangovers and high treason on\r\ntheir consciences. But the Japanese did not have adequate channels of\r\ncommunication, supply, and control between their smooth system at the\r\ntop, and the working propagandists at the bottom. The _Kempeitai_\r\n(military-political gendarmerie) structure got in the way; Japanese\r\npropaganda lines lost touch with the strategic realities of their slow\r\ndefeat. They did, instead, what any propaganda system does on the\r\ndowngrade; they turned to repression instead of counterpropaganda with\r\nthe inevitable result.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the American psychological warfare structure included\r\nTheater operating units, usually called PWB (Psychological Warfare\r\nBranch), although it became PWD (Psychological Warfare Division) in\r\nSHAEF and did not grow beyond TPWO (Theater Psychological Warfare\r\nOfficer) in China Theater. The supreme authority was, of course, the\r\nTheater Commander, on whose responsibility the operation had to be\r\ncarried out. When propaganda bungled and got into the field of political\r\ntrouble, it was the Theater Commander and not the subordinates who took\r\nthe blame. Every theater was under the command of a general, except for\r\nCentral Pacific (under Admiral Nimitz, and he used an Army colonel as\r\nhis propaganda chief). In most theaters, the Political Adviser was the\r\nbuffer between psychological warfare and the commander himself; in\r\nSouthwest Pacific and later the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander\r\nfor the Allied Powers, Japan, General MacArthur instituted the office of\r\nMilitary Secretary and made this officer responsible for reporting to\r\nhim personally the developments in the propaganda field.\r\n\r\nSubject to local variation, the Theater agencies faced similar problems.\r\nThey had to serve in turn as a rear echelon to service the needs of\r\ncombat propaganda, while working as the actual operating agencies for\r\nthe bigger radio programs and the preparation of strategic leaflets. As\r\nthe areas behind them became more consolidated, displays and films took\r\ntheir place beside news and leaflets as chores that had to be performed.\r\nCommunications facilities were a problem. Purely military facilities\r\ncould not, of course, be overloaded by the lightly coded transmission of\r\nhundreds of thousands of words of political and other news and guidance;\r\nthe psychological warfare establishments had to jerry-build\r\ncommunications facilities out of what they could borrow from Army, or\r\nobtain from OWI supplies in the United States, or buy locally.\r\n\r\nIn most Theater organizations, the chief was a military man and the\r\nstaff was partly military and partly civilian. Under General Eisenhower,\r\nPWD was not only Army and OWI but included OSS, on the American side,\r\nalong with British partnership, French participation, and other Allied\r\npersonnel as well. Under General MacArthur, OWI participated under\r\nstrict Army control. Under General Stilwell, no Theater organization as\r\nsuch was set up; the G-2, the Political Adviser or the General himself\r\nhandled propaganda matters when they turned up. Under General Wedemeyer,\r\nthere was a Theater officer. Under General Sultan, the OWI ran itself;\r\nthe Outpost serviced the Theater. Under General Clay, Information\r\nControl Service, OMGUS, became an integral part of military control. The\r\nsame thing happened in General MacArthur's reorganized PWB--an\r\norganization termed CIES (Civil Information and Education Section) had\r\nthe organization and personnel not only of the American structure, but\r\nthe usable purged parts of the _Joho Kyoku_ obedient to its command and\r\nliaison. Other Theaters had comparable arrangements, each suited to the\r\nTheater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 50: Consolidation Propaganda: Door Gods._ One of\r\nthe most unusual consolidation propaganda operations was the\r\ndistribution of \"door gods.\" These were small good-looking posters which\r\ntraditionally displayed figures from the Chinese Pantheon. During the\r\nwar, farm families who had been accustomed to putting up new door gods\r\neach lunar New Year found that they could not afford them. China\r\nDivision, OWI, then run by F. M. Fisher, Richard Watts, Jr., Graham\r\nPeck, and James Stewart, made up new door gods which showed American\r\naviators, thus familiarizing the Chinese peasantry with our insignia and\r\npreaching the cause of inter-Allied cooperation.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chart IX_\r\n\r\n                                PRODUCTION\r\n                                    of a\r\n                              TACTICAL LEAFLET\r\n                                (Army Level)\r\n\r\n          INTELLIGENCE\r\n  +----------+   +----------+\r\n  | RECORDING|   | CIVILIAN |\r\n  |   UNIT   |   | INTERROG.|\r\n  |          |   | OFFICERS |\r\n  +-----+----+   +-----+----+\r\n        |              |\r\n        v              v\r\n        +------+-------+\r\n               |\r\n               v                                              PRODUCTION\r\n   +-----------+----------+                                 +------------+\r\n   |     INTELLIGENCE     |                                 |   LEAFLET  |\r\n   |        OFFICER       +==============++            ++===+   WRITER   |\r\n   |       AND STAFF      |              ||            ||   |            |\r\n   +-----------+----------+              ||            ||   +------+-----+\r\n               ^                         ||            ||          |\r\n               |                         ||            ||          |\r\n        +------+-------+                 ||            ||          |\r\n        ^      |       ^                 ||            ||          |\r\n        |      |       |                 ||            ||          v\r\n  +-----+----+ | +-----+----+            ||            ||   +------+-----+\r\n  |    POW   | | |   CORPS  |            ||            ||   |   LAYOUT   |\r\n  | INTERROG.| | |  LIAISON |            ||            ++===+   ARTIST   |\r\n  | OFFICERS | | | OFFICERS |            ||            ||   |            |\r\n  +----------+ | +----------+            ||            ||   +------+-----+\r\n               |                         ||            ||          |\r\n        +------+-------+                 ||            ||          |\r\n        ^              ^                 ||            ||          |\r\n        |              |                 ||            ||          V\r\n  +-----+----+  +------+----+   +--------++-------+    ||   +------+-----+\r\n  |MONITORING|  |PSYCH.

The G-3's and G-4's of the Theaters normally serviced\r\nthe PWB's along with the rest of their work. The OWI and other civilian\r\npersons were put into uniform and given simulated rank, sometimes wildly\r\ndisproportionate to their Army counterparts. The Army G-2's naturally\r\nworked with the PWB intelligence facilities; in some Theaters the G-2\r\nwas _ex officio_ the chief of psychological warfare, as was the\r\nAssistant Chief of Staff G-2, War Department General Staff, himself at\r\nhome. G-1's usually kept out of the way of psychological warfare and the\r\nhousekeeping of the units was in most cases autonomous.\r\n\r\nResponsibility for financing psychological warfare was never established\r\nas doctrine. The State Department kept most of it off its budget,\r\nleaving the actual payments up to the War Department and the OWI to\r\nfigure out. Oftentimes this resulted in a curious sort of neo-capitalism\r\nwithin the U.S.-owned socialism of the Army. The two agencies would hold\r\non to property as though it were private property, on the basis of\r\nimmediate title, without reference to the plain fact that all of it was\r\npaid for in the end by the United States Treasurer. (OWI once murmured\r\nthreateningly about bringing its radio material home from Manila rather\r\nthan let General MacArthur's people highjack it. Such talk ended when\r\nthe material was declared surplus or stolen.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Field Operations.= Field operations were most highly developed in the\r\nMediterranean and European Theaters of Operation. Combat propaganda\r\nunits came into being, carrying fully equipped mobile radio stations,\r\nand high-volume printing presses, along with them. Later, under SHAEF,\r\nthese units developed further and Army-level organizations were set up\r\nwhich duplicated the Theater organizations on a reduced scale. (See\r\nChart IX for chart of an Army unit.)\r\n\r\nThe tactical leaflet (page 211) came into its own with such units. It\r\nwas possible to develop high-speed routines for using intelligence\r\nswiftly. Maps were dropped on the enemy in unfavorable situations. Order\r\nof Battle became highly important for psychological warfare purposes\r\nwhen enemy units could be addressed by their proper unit designation or\r\nby the name of their commanders. Intelligence was brought into play: bad\r\nfood, bad supply, poor command, or mishandling of enemy forces in any\r\nway brought prompt propaganda comment.\r\n\r\nRadio was the least useful for tactical operations simply because enemy\r\ntroops do not carry private portable radio sets around with them. Radio\r\nwas of high value in consolidation operations, passing along\r\ninstructions to liberated populations, and telling civilians in the line\r\nof approach about measures which they could take for the common benefit\r\nof themselves and of the Allies.\r\n\r\nA constant problem, never completely ironed out, was the use of\r\nairplanes for dropping purposes. The leaflet producers had, in all\r\nTheaters, a tendency to prepare excellent leaflets, bale them, and send\r\nthem along to the airfields in the expectation that an overworked,\r\nunindoctrinated air force staff would automatically pick up the\r\nleaflets, develop dropping mechanisms, pack the leaflets into planes,\r\ntake them out and drop them to the right language-groups at the right\r\ntime in the right place. This was of course as absurd from the aviators'\r\nside as it was, to the civilians, to let their brain-children accumulate\r\nin hangars or warehouses. For strategic droppings, systematic\r\narrangements could be made through proper official channels, and a\r\nregular air operation detailed to do the job. Tactical dropping did not\r\nallow enough time for elaborate staff work in each instance, and\r\nrecourse was had to psychological warfare liaison officers (either Army\r\nofficers or civilians with the approximate status of Tech-rep, technical\r\nrepresentative, a familiar sight on World War II airfields) to get in\r\ntouch with the units, help them install dropping facilities, explain the\r\nleaflets to the actual pilots and bombardiers, and thus obtain a high\r\ndegree of cooperation. In almost every theater, this policy succeeded,\r\nand a wide variety of leaflet bombs, leaflet dispensers, and other\r\nleaflet-circulating gadgets was developed.\r\n\r\nArtillery distribution also played a significant part. For front-line\r\nsituations artillery could do the job better than planes, without\r\nrisking aircraft in a quasi-combat operation. Leaflet bombs of\r\nconsiderable scope appeared, and could be made to fit almost any\r\nappropriate weapon. Circulation was also effected by means of\r\nclandestine operations to friendly civilians, frequently combined with\r\nair-drop of weapons, medicine, and other essentials.\r\n\r\nThe organization of all these new functions has changed military\r\norganization. A whole new series of units were attached in echelon, each\r\nfitted to the appropriate level for its work. The rear-area functions\r\nand strategic propaganda work always required a considerable proportion\r\nof civilian aid, since some of the best workers in this line were\r\npersons who either did not wish to join the Army or whom the Army did\r\nnot wish to have join it. These psychological warfare organizations were\r\nunbelievably cheap, even if measured by the most conservative estimates\r\nof their success. It is impossible that the army of the future, whether\r\nAmerican or foreign, will overlook this source of assistance.\r\nPsychological warfare nowhere replaced combat, but it made the impact of\r\ncombat on the enemy more effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11\r\n\r\nPlans and Planning\r\n\r\n\r\nWith most military planning, it is feasible to work from the top down,\r\ndefine the strategic objective and then work out the actual requirements\r\nof the operation in advance. This is not true of psychological\r\nwarfare.[39] The objectives may be defined, and in the process of\r\ndefinition the general needs of a propaganda agency may be clarified. If\r\na plan calls for a press or a radio, somebody can requisition a Davidson\r\nPress or a Hallicrafter radio and get ready to use it. But the plan\r\ncannot define goals, set time limits for the achievement of the goals,\r\nrelate the goals to one another in a scheduled pre-fixed program of\r\nsuccess, establish terms whereby psychological victory can be told from\r\npsychological defeat.\r\n\r\nPsychological victory exists only in terms of the military victory which\r\nit is designed to assist. Psychological defeat, no matter how much\r\ncritics or the enemy propagandist may allege it, can be proved to exist\r\nonly when an actual defeat makes it real. Psychological plans are always\r\ncontingency plans for the assistance of military operations. They are\r\ndependent on the military operation and they cannot be checked against\r\nfact except in terms of the military operations they ostensibly support.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, they were not always written with these reservations in\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Needs of the Operator: Materials and Guidance.= American officers,\r\nassisting foreign troops, could not plan logistics until they found out\r\nwhat the foreign troops actually required. How much did they eat, and\r\nwhat? How much could they carry, and for how long? How much tonnage had\r\nto be sent them, and how often? Such questions had to be asked about the\r\nneeds of the individual men before unit planning, not to mention\r\nnational planning, became possible at all.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in psychological warfare, planning can be made realistic if\r\nit starts with the individual operation for the control of which the\r\nplanning is done. Define the operator as anyone having a task in the\r\nactual preparation, production or transmission of propaganda materials,\r\nwhether through electric communications or by print. The operator is not\r\nusually a person with a high security classification, yet he plays his\r\nindispensable part in fulfilling the highest and most secret strategy\r\nof the war. How can a plan be written that will be useful in carrying\r\nout the actual (and highly secret) strategy of the war while meeting the\r\nneeds of an inexpert individual way down at the bottom of the control\r\nsystem? The answer is, of course, that no such plan can be prepared.\r\nDifferent plans are needed for successive phases.\r\n\r\nThe operator needs simple but basic materials. If he is a producer of\r\nsome kind--such as a creative writer, an artist, a singer, a program\r\narranger, a newscaster who does his own scripts and so on--he is likely\r\nto be a person with ideas of his own. Individual creativeness cannot\r\nusually be turned on and off like a faucet. Low-ranking and disciplined\r\nthough the hired writer may be, he is still subject to the inward\r\nfrailties of authors if he is any good. (This particular author\r\nsympathized deeply with some poor American Japanese who were given\r\nunbelievably dull outlines and told, \"Turn this into exciting Japanese\r\nmaterial! Give it pep! Make it rock them off their _tatami_! But don't\r\nget away from that outline one damn inch!\" The _nisei_ rolled their\r\neyes; they did a poor job, as they knew that they would.)\r\n\r\nThe person who has to be told day in and day out how to operate is no\r\noperator at all. Psychological warfare is no place for unsuccessful\r\nshort-story writers or would-be radio commentators. It demands\r\nprofessional standards, and it has more than professional difficulties.\r\nTherefore what the operator needs is not technical instruction but\r\ngeneral guidance.\r\n\r\nHe must be told what he can say, what he cannot say. He should whenever\r\npossible be given some reason for perplexing or cryptic instructions. He\r\nshould be helped to become familiar with what we are trying to tell the\r\nenemy. There is nothing classified about that, since the enemy is to be\r\ntold it as soon as possible. The guidance given the operator should be:\r\n\r\n  (1) Plain.\r\n\r\n  (2) Feasible. (This sounds superfluous, but was not so during World\r\n  War II when operators were sometimes told to attack such-and-such an\r\n  enemy institution without referring to it directly or indirectly.)\r\n\r\n  (3) Organized. (The material at OWI was not organized until the last\r\n  several months of the war, with the result that hundreds of thousands\r\n  of words of propaganda commands remained in force, technically, but\r\n  un-indexed and arranged only by weekly form.)\r\n\r\n  (4) Specific in showing timing. (General controls should not be issued\r\n  at the beginning of operations; when revised, the revision should\r\n  supersede the revised section, and not be placed beside it. Other\r\n  provisions should be given expiration dates, after which they pass out\r\n  of effect.)\r\n\r\n  (5) Mandatory. (Control should be expressed in _do_ or _don't_;\r\n  personal advice is better conveyed through informal channels.)\r\n\r\n  (6) Non-security or low-classified. (This material, for the operators,\r\n  should be accessible to the operators. Often the most important\r\n  operator--the best newsman, the most effective leaflet artist--may be\r\n  a rather doubtful citizen, an alien, or even an enemy volunteer. He\r\n  cannot follow guidances unless he knows them, and it makes a farce of\r\n  security for his superior to be able to tell him the guidance, so that\r\n  he can memorize it, but not able to give him the document itself.)\r\n\r\nThese rules, though simple, are not always easy to follow. Here is an\r\nexample of a bad guidance:\r\n\r\n  CLASSIFIED\r\n\r\n  Without superseding instructions concerning religion, we may use the\r\n  occasion of the Sacred Banyan Tree Festival to needle the Provisional\r\n  President. Make a dramatic story of the President's life. Undermine\r\n  his use of religion to bolster the dictatorship.\r\n\r\n  Caution: do not mention religion. Do not indulge in scurrilous\r\n  personal attacks. Material concerning our information of the\r\n  President's biography is highly classified and must not be used.\r\n\r\nThe exaggeration may seem apparent, but it is a fair sample of the worst\r\ndirectives as actually issued and many, though not quite so bad, were\r\nnear it. The same guidance in more acceptable form would read:\r\n\r\n  UNRESTRICTED\r\n\r\n  (Expires 24 September, week following Festival.) Standing instructions\r\n  make Banyan Tree Festival difficult topic with which to deal. If\r\n  operators can suggest means of referring to Festival without violating\r\n  prohibitions against religious offense, encourage them to try.\r\n  Monitoring and diplomatic sources show that Provisional President is\r\n  utilizing Festival to consolidate his position. If he can be attacked,\r\n  do so.\r\n\r\nThe other need of the actual operator is material. The script writer\r\nneeds actual texts of everyday enemy speech in order to keep his slang\r\nand idiom up to date. The artist needs correct photographs of enemy\r\ncities in wartimes so that the leaflet picture he makes will not look as\r\noutmoded as a crinoline or a Model T. All of them need all the\r\ninformation they can get about their own country--good handbooks,\r\ndictionaries, elementary histories, textbooks in fields which they may\r\nnot know. It is amazing how hard it is to explain America to foreigners;\r\nthe American soon finds out how little he knows his own country, and\r\nneeds information about his own background along with current materials\r\nconcerning the enemy.\r\n\r\nWhere radio propaganda is in question, the script-writers and\r\nbroadcasters will read the enemy radio propaganda if they do not get\r\nenough fresh non-propaganda material concerning their audience. Sooner\r\nor later this will degenerate into alternate soliloquies of the radio\r\nmen on each side, each watching the other to see if he got a rise out of\r\nhim last time. OWI people frequently expressed idiot glee at having made\r\nRadio Tokyo frantic. The OWI men were the first to admit that their glee\r\nwas pointless, since it was the Japanese broadcaster and not the\r\nJapanese audience who responded. But for lack of current information\r\nabout the enemy the propagandist will refer to his own professional\r\nopponent. There is, of course, a very substantial difference between a\r\nchange in enemy propaganda occasioned by a real inroad which one's own\r\npropaganda had made in enemy opinion, and a change that consists simply\r\nin angry or smart backtalk. Finding that difference is the\r\nresponsibility of propanal, not of the operator.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pre-Belligerent Planning.= Pre-belligerent planning differs from\r\nregular planning in that it does not have the substantial context of\r\nactual military operations to make it realistic and urgent. Like all\r\nplans, the pre-belligerent plan should enumerate the facilities\r\navailable, the basic course of action to be followed, and the limits\r\nwithin which offensive propaganda will be permitted. In fairness to the\r\nplanners themselves, as well as to the authorities who will fit this\r\nplan into related military, economic, or political plans, the plan\r\nshould define the proper scope of propaganda as applied to the\r\ncontemplated situation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most useful functions of the pre-belligerent plan lies in the\r\nperiodic exercise which it gives in propaganda discipline. Information\r\nand intelligence agencies frequently see their jobs so technically that\r\nthey lose sight of the need for coordination within the mechanism of an\r\nentire government. Press relations people try to get stories in the\r\npapers. Radio people try to maintain listener interest. Educational\r\nofficers are concerned with the teachability of their materials.\r\nSpokesmen of the different agencies in related fields (such as shipping,\r\nair transport, currency control, social welfare) are apt to comment on a\r\nparticular situation without reference to the needs of an inclusive\r\nnational policy. How much advice was handed out on the occasion of the\r\nultimatum to Tito? The Jugoslav authorities plainly risked\r\npolitico-psychological pressure from us; they came prepared for the\r\nconsequences; but both American official and private opinion expressed a\r\nwild medley of recommendations, suggestions, and analysis. Federal\r\nofficials showed no better discipline than did the private citizens.\r\nPre-belligerent planning may be forced on the United States by eventual\r\ninternational crises, but before that stage is reached, private and\r\ngovernmental persons working in the informational field might do well to\r\nconsider how readily they could offer or enforce cooperation in the\r\nevent of a real emergency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 51: Basic Types: Start of War._ This leaflet\r\nembodies almost all possible mistakes in psychological warfare. It was\r\nprepared to explain why war came between America and Japan, but was not\r\neven begun until many months after Pearl Harbor. The heading and style\r\nare official and formal. The message is no more than a footnote to\r\nhistory. Its last fault redeemed it; no arrangements were made for\r\ndropping it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Psychological Warfare Plans.= A general plan for psychological warfare\r\nexpresses the aims of the portion of the war (either in point of time,\r\nor with respect to a stated area) to which it refers. It states the\r\nmaximum goals which psychological warfare can, with honest realism, be\r\ncounted on to accomplish if all goes well. It indicates the minimum\r\neffect, which (unlike combat operations) can fall precisely at zero.\r\n\r\nThe general plan then goes on to state the conditions which will govern\r\nthe operating agencies. The important part of this section lies in\r\nguessing where the operating agencies are likely to need coordination\r\nand where not. If the plan is to reveal highly important and therefore\r\nsecret strategy, it should merely sketch the broad outlines of the\r\nprocesses intended, leaving to experts the responsibility of determining\r\nspecific _do's_ and _don'ts_. In such a case, however, the plan should\r\nnot leave room for inter-agency or inter-personal doubt as to where the\r\ninterpretive function lies. Too often, highly formal agreements are\r\ninterpreted out of existence by propagandists who are interested in\r\nadding their own proposals to those set forth and agreed upon in the\r\nplan. When definition of the plan in operational terms[40] is needed,\r\nthe location of the sub-definer should be made very plain unless the\r\npropaganda establishment itself happens to be remarkably well organized\r\nand in no further need of definite prescriptions of function.\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of actual political and military goals in a propaganda\r\nplan is an exceedingly ambitious undertaking. The goal, \"To foster a\r\nspirit of nationalism and independence among the Eastern Arachosian\r\npeople to the end that they may revolt and set up their own pro-Allied\r\ngovernment,\" is a commitment beyond the reach of normal propaganda. It\r\ncomes closer to requiring all the facilities of the operating state,\r\nfinancial, diplomatic, covert, and paramilitary, to put it into effect.\r\nThe goal, \"To give sympathetic circulation to Eastern Arachosian\r\nautonomist sentiments so as to promote interference with the occupying\r\npower,\" is much more nearly attainable. Military goals are often\r\ndescribed by propagandists as attainable by means of propaganda alone,\r\nbut there is no known example of psychological warfare having attained a\r\nstrictly military goal without assistance by other means of warfare.\r\nGoals such as \"the defeat of ----,\" \"the surrender of ----,\" or the\r\n\"destruction of ----,\" have no place in practical propaganda planning,\r\nsince they are pretentious or deceptive. More legitimate are the goals\r\nactually obtained by propaganda, such as \"encouragement of a spirit of\r\nfactionalism which may assist defeat ...,\" \"promotion of war-weariness\r\nthat will make the process of surrender more easily accomplished ...,\"\r\nand \"appeals for the destruction of ----.\" Such points may appear minor,\r\nbut it is the overstatement of the propaganda case that has many times\r\ngoaded disinterested outsiders into becoming skeptics or opponents.\r\n\r\nPolitical and military goals can be described only in terms of hopes;\r\neffective psychological goals--goals resting in the form of opinion\r\nwhich it is desired to create--are very concrete. If enemy surrender is\r\ndesired, propaganda leaves to the operator no further scope for revenge\r\nthemes which will frighten the enemy away from surrender. If the enemy\r\nleader is to be discredited on the basis of having poor military\r\njudgment, the contrasting good judgment of the enemy general is a\r\nnecessary ingredient. The psychological goals have to be framed in terms\r\nof how much the enemy listener, the Propaganda Man, can stand and can\r\nbelieve. (See page 153.) Since he listens irregularly, furtively, and\r\nhalf-antagonistically, propaganda will defeat itself if it shifts from\r\ngoal to goal with logical but finespun dexterity. Psychological goals\r\nare attained only by sustained, consistent patterns of propaganda; they\r\nhave to be plain, repetitive, and insistent. Political and military\r\ngoals can be anything the planners feel like including as a pious wish.\r\nThey might as well consist of a current re-statement of political and\r\nmilitary aims for the subject or area at the time of planning. They are\r\nbeyond the reach of practical psychological warfare.\r\n\r\nNational-level and general staff level plans have to be made up in much\r\nthe same way. If the plan is good it will provide for its own\r\ncirculation to all government instrumentalities which do in fact conduct\r\npropaganda in the particular field involved. It does no good to adopt a\r\nplan for the encouragement of the Filipinos and the inducement of\r\ncooperation among the Filipino officials of the Japanese-sponsored\r\nRepublic (which means a tone of conciliation toward Filipino leaders or\r\nofficials who hold puppet titles) if a cabinet member keeps calling\r\npublicly for the immediate execution of any Filipino who ever had dinner\r\nwith a Japanese. It is useless to try to cooperate with Communist\r\nguerrillas in West K'tai on the argument, \"We all oppose the Axis\r\ntogether! Ideologies don't matter when brave men fight side by side\"--if\r\nat the same time the guerrillas know we have a strong domestic campaign\r\non against Communism. Telling a Communist that ideologies don't matter\r\nis like saying to a Jesuit, \"Let's skip the superstitions, Father, and\r\nleave religion out of it. Get down to business.\" To some kinds of\r\npeople, ideology _is_ business. The broad propaganda plan should make\r\nchoices that reflect the judgment of the reviewing officers. If they are\r\nmade in a vacuum, without taking into consideration the actual opinion\r\nof the audience group, they might as well not be made at all.\r\n\r\nPropaganda plans must be circulated to non-propaganda agencies in order\r\nto make sure that routine public relations or announcements of current\r\nor contemplated action, and statements of basic policy do not contradict\r\nor neutralize the plan once it is put into effect. Frequently months of\r\npropaganda work can be undone by a tactless speech from somebody in the\r\nsame government but in an unrelated agency. Authoritative circulation of\r\nthe plan--which means that the plan must be neither long nor\r\nover-secret--can help forestall such mistakes. Speech clearance,\r\nrequiring review of all official and policy-making speeches in advance\r\nof delivery, is the surest safeguard against overt collision between\r\ndifferent spokesmen. In World War II it was applied with some success,\r\nbut the exceptions were so conspicuous that the effective coordination\r\npassed almost unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Strategic and Consolidation Plans.= Advance psychological warfare plans\r\nfor concrete military operations not only require a statement of the\r\npropaganda operation to be performed with facilities and personnel who\r\nare expected to remain static, but demand that the psychological warfare\r\npersonnel, together with the needful gear, be moved right along with the\r\nadvancing forces. This makes planning more definite, and those parts of\r\nthe plans that do not require psychological or political prescription of\r\ncontent can be written in standard military form.\r\n\r\nWise consolidation plans give urgent priority to the restoration of the\r\nhome-grown informational media and recreational facilities of the\r\noccupied territory. Definite anticipation of shortages in radio\r\nfacilities, newsprint, ink, paper, and other supplies can ensure prompt\r\nreopening of consolidated facilities under way. The propaganda operators\r\nmay tell higher echelons that the local people are not competent, cannot\r\nbe trusted, and so on, but General MacArthur's experience in Japan would\r\nseem to indicate that no army can carry on consolidation propaganda as\r\nefficiently as the conquered civilians themselves can, provided the\r\ncivilians have:\r\n\r\n  (1) Reasonable though restricted freedom of utterance, so that they\r\n  can know what they may or may not say;\r\n\r\n  (2) Prompt liaison for security and policy clearance, so that they can\r\n  get an authoritative yes-or-no answer on proposed projects, enabling\r\n  them to maintain operation without intolerable delays;\r\n\r\n  (3) Friendly professional assistance in meeting material and staff\r\n  shortages;\r\n\r\n  (4) A series of phases, marking off the forms and methods of control\r\n  so that the controlling staff can plan for a first phase of doing its\r\n  own publishing and broadcasting, a second phase of letting the local\r\n  people work under license with close supervision and technical help,\r\n  and a third phase of permitting them freedom within the normal\r\n  censorship limits of military government. The American DISCC's\r\n  (District Information Services Control Commands) in the American Zone\r\n  of Germany did an excellent job in moving rapidly from phase one to\r\n  phase two in 1945 and 1946.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Contingency Plans.= Frequently the chiefs of government and services\r\nknow of an operation or danger that may arise, which will change the\r\ncharacter of the war. Such were the North African landings, the Italian\r\nsurrender, D-day itself, the joining of the American and Russian forces\r\nin Germany, Hitler's death. For such contingencies, it is desirable to\r\nhave plans ready stating the reaction of the government to the event.\r\nSuch plans can be prepared and distributed to select personnel, and\r\ndowngraded or released, together with any needed last-minute change,\r\nwhen the first word comes through that the event is officially to be\r\nrecognized. Profoundly secret contingencies--such as Hiroshima day--do\r\nnot lend themselves to such treatment.\r\n\r\nIt must be repeated that plans are effective only when transposed into\r\nplain, simple, usable guidances for the actual operatives. When a plan\r\nis so secret or so involved that the only people who could carry it out\r\nare not allowed to know anything about it, it becomes a sad\r\nself-defeating effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12\r\n\r\nOperations for Civilians\r\n\r\n\r\nPlainly, psychological warfare operates against civilians with as much\r\neffect as it does against troops. Indeed, under the rather high\r\nstandards set for modern warfare by The Hague and Geneva conventions,\r\npsychological warfare is left as one of the few completely legitimate\r\nweapons which can on occasion be directed against an exclusively\r\ncivilian and noncombatant target. Even though World War II erased most\r\nof the distinctions between military and civilian, leaving civilians in\r\nthe vertical front line of all air war, psychological warfare gained. It\r\nbecame a more useful instrument for bettering war. Civilian interest in\r\npropaganda became no mere matter of emotional loyalty or philosophical\r\npreference, but a life-and-death matter to its recipients. After fire\r\nraids it would be a madman who would disregard an enemy bomb-warning\r\nleaflet without trying to figure out its application to himself and his\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Short-wave Radio.= Short-wave radio is the chief burden-bearer of\r\nlong-distance psychological warfare. It is more useful as a means of\r\nconnecting originating offices with standard-wave relay stations than as\r\na direct means of communication. Even in free countries, short-wave sets\r\nare not often plentiful. The conditions of reception, from a purely\r\ntechnical point of view, are often undesirable; recreational material\r\ndoes not go through since a short-wave listener will put up with the\r\nstatic when he is receiving vital, vividly presented news, but often\r\nwill not try to make out soap opera or music over the squawks of the\r\nether, and the use of short-wave reception in wartime implies a\r\ndeliberate willingness on the part of the listener to do something which\r\nhe knows to be disloyal or dangerous.\r\n\r\nShort-wave does make it possible for advanced standard-wave propaganda\r\nstations to pass along material which has been prepared in the homeland.\r\nLarge staffs can do the work. The news can be put through a large,\r\nalert, well organized office. Features can be prepared by real\r\nprofessionals, acted out by a number of actors, put on records,\r\nreviewed, and then relayed to the standard-wave station whenever needed.\r\nThe Americans at Radio Saipan thus broadcast right into Japan, and were\r\nable to transmit materials which could not possibly have been put on the\r\nair with the staff working on the island. The people at Saipan were\r\nmostly telecommunications technicians, engaged in picking up the\r\nshort-wave from Hawaii or San Francisco and in passing it on into the\r\nenemy country on the standard wave length. Millions of Japanese heard\r\nour Saipan standard-wave broadcasts, in contrast to the dozens or\r\nhundreds who had heard our short-wave previously.\r\n\r\nThe use of homeland facilities makes possible the advance preparation of\r\na large collection of material ready for broadcast. In security-sensitive\r\nor otherwise dubious situations, four or five alternate programs can be\r\nworked out for the same amount of program time. On wire recorders or\r\ndisc records, the proposed material can be passed around in finished\r\nform, reviewed, selected, censored, and approved. This would not be true\r\nof a hurried station working far forward in the zone of operations.\r\n\r\nShort-wave has its own advantages, however, apart from its utility as a\r\nmeans of getting program material to the relay stations. Short-wave can\r\nand will be picked up by the enemy monitors and enemy intelligence\r\nsystems. It will also be heard by persons of power, wealth, and\r\ninfluence, irrespective of the economic or political system of the\r\nenemy. The big shots of any system know how to transcend limitations\r\nthat awe or defeat the ordinary man. The short-wave transmitter speaks\r\ntherefore to the enemy government, to the groups which compose the enemy\r\ngovernment, and to the individuals in or out of the enemy government who\r\nare leaders in their own country. We found that the _Joho Kyoku_ and the\r\n_Gaimusho_ (Foreign Office) in Tokyo were mimeographing a daily summary\r\nof our San Francisco broadcasts, and we thus knew that anything we said\r\nover San Francisco would be heard by the most influential men in Japan.\r\nCaptain Ellis Zacharias, U.S.N., spoke Japanese and had known most of\r\nthe Japanese leaders personally before the war; with government\r\nmonitoring known to exist he felt free to address the Japanese leaders\r\npersonally and directly with assurance his words would reach them, and\r\nhis broadcasts are confessed by the Japanese themselves to have played a\r\ncontributory part in bringing about the Japanese decision to surrender.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Standard-wave.= The most effective use of radio is that which falls\r\nwithin the receiving capacity of the ordinary receiving sets owned or\r\nused by the enemy population. This means the establishment of\r\ntransmitting facilities close enough to the enemy territory for the\r\nprograms to get through. As between the United States and Japan from\r\n1941 through 1944, this was very difficult. No Americans ever dared join\r\nthe Shantung guerrillas, whether Kuomintang or Communist, with\r\ntransmitters; and as long as we broadcast from the safety of our side of\r\nthe ocean, we could only hope that occasional freak conditions would\r\necho programs into Japan two or three times a month. With the British\r\nand the Germans, it was altogether different; the two countries were\r\nvirtually touching, and each could cover the entire enemy territory.\r\n\r\nWith short-distance standard-wave broadcasting to an enemy known to have\r\nmillions of radio receivers, strategic radio becomes effective. The\r\nchance is provided for building up a consistent group of listeners, for\r\ninfluencing their morale and opinions, and for circulating rumors that\r\nwill reach almost every single person in the enemy population. The\r\ntemptation to perform tricks, to lapse back to peacetime standards of\r\nradio-as-entertainment or radio-as-advertising, is a constant one. The\r\npropagandist knows that he is being heard, and he fears that his\r\naudience will lose interest if he does not stimulate them with a\r\nbrilliantly variegated series of programs.\r\n\r\nBlack radio comes into its own on standard wave. The British could put\r\nthe mysterious anti-British, anti-Hitler broadcaster _Gustav Siegfried\r\nEins_ on the air, with his rousing obscenities, his coarse but\r\nbelievable gossip, his wild diatribes against the Allies and against the\r\nNazi scum who got in the way of the glorious German army. He was so good\r\nthat for a while even American propanal thought he might be a spokesman\r\nfor the saucier members of the _Wehrmacht_ general staff. The Germans\r\ncould broadcast proletarian propaganda on the _Lenin Old Guard_ station,\r\nfoaming at the mouth whenever they mentioned the crazy vile Fascist\r\nswine Hitler, and then going into tantrums because the Communist party\r\nneeded all the brave glorious leaders who had been murdered by the fat\r\nbureaucrat Stalin. Ed and Joe could talk out of Bremen and pretend to be\r\nscooting around the American mid-west, one jump ahead of the G-men with\r\ntheir trailer and concealed transmitter, telling the rest of the\r\nAmericans the low-down about \"that goof Roosevelt and his Jewish war,\"\r\nbut Ed and Joe were not good enough to fool anybody. Black radio is\r\ngreat fun for the operators, but its use is often limited to a twisted\r\nkind of entertainment designed to affect the morale of dubious groups.\r\nIt leaps to sudden importance only in times of critical panic when it\r\ncan add the last catalyst to national confusion, precipitating chaos.\r\n\r\nThe beginning and end of standard-wave transmission is news. News (see\r\npage 135) uses standard appeals. It should be factual but selectively\r\nfactual. Repetition of basic themes is much more important than the\r\nconstant invention of new ones. The propaganda chief has nothing to do,\r\nday in and day out, but to think of his own programs. He becomes\r\nfamiliar with them and bored by them. He visualizes his Propaganda Man\r\nas a person who hears all transmissions and is understandably bored by\r\nthem, overlooking the interruptions that listeners face, the long gaps\r\nbetween the programs they hear, the weather interference, the static,\r\nthe police measures.\r\n\r\nEven with peacetime facilities tremendous simplicity and repetition are\r\nneeded to convey advertising on the radio. In wartime repetition is\r\neven more necessary. It serves the double function of driving the theme\r\nhome to listeners who have heard it before, while broadening the circle\r\nof listeners with each transmission. A point of diminishing returns is\r\nsoon reached but even diminished returns are often rewarding. The\r\nhardest-to-reach people are sometimes the ones it is most important to\r\nreach with a simple, basic, persuasive item. Repetition thus ensures\r\ndepth of response in the core audience, while adding to the marginal\r\naudience with each additional application. What is deadly monotonous to\r\nthe propagandist himself may, on the thousandth repetition, merely have\r\nbecome pleasantly familiar to the Propaganda Man on the other end. The\r\nauthor has talked to any number of clandestine listeners to our\r\npropaganda who have almost wept with rage as they told of listening to\r\njokes, novelties, political speeches and other funny stuff when they\r\nhoped to get a clean-cut announcement of the latest military news.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Communication Through the Mails.= In World War II, propaganda was not\r\nable to make use of the mails the way that the propagandists of World\r\nWar I succeeded in doing. The mails were much more intermittent. The\r\nchannels into Germany through Scandinavia were not kept open except for\r\nSweden, which was reachable, rather perilously, by air alone; Iberia was\r\nan inhospitable base. German counterintelligence was more than ruthless;\r\nit was effectively savage and made the Germany of Kaiser Wilhelm seem\r\nrustic by contrast. With Japan, anything would have had to go through\r\nSoviet censorship to get there in the first place, and then meet the\r\ntraditional intricacies of Japanese red tape. Mail propaganda was\r\ntherefore not heavily developed.\r\n\r\nSomething was accomplished, however, by use of the Portuguese, Spanish,\r\nSwiss and Chinese press. Enemy officials and private persons were known\r\nto read these, and it was possible to do a great deal toward influencing\r\neditorial content.\r\n\r\nMajor mail-propaganda operations were conducted against us, however. The\r\nNazis, as part of their prebelligerent planning and operations, sent\r\nenormous quantities of propaganda through the United States\r\nmail--sometimes postage-free under the frank of Congressmen. The\r\nJapanese, down to the time of Pearl Harbor, kept large public-relations\r\nstaffs running at full speed in New York, Washington, and other American\r\ncities. They helped their American friends with money and by heavy\r\npurchase of copyright material friendly to Japan--thus making it\r\nunnecessary for any author to report himself as a Japanese paid agent,\r\nand they offered Japanese \"cultural and educational\" information to\r\ninterested persons. It really was cultural and well done. By talking\r\nabout Japanese poetry, religion and cherry blossoms, and omitting all\r\nwar propaganda, the handsome little booklets kept alive the memory of a\r\nhospitable, quaint, charming Japan. Some of this material was mailed\r\ndirectly from Japan to the United States.\r\n\r\nSince mail propaganda depends on the freedom of the mails, it is much\r\nmore apt to be used by a dictatorship against us than by us against a\r\ndictatorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Leaflets.= The types of leaflets are described in the next chapter\r\n(page 211), in the course of discussing leaflets addressed to troops.\r\nEach leaflet designed for a military group has its civilian equivalents.\r\nIn addition to the military types, overt propaganda leaflets for\r\ncivilians should include:\r\n\r\n  (1) Communications from the legitimate authorities (whether\r\n  government-in-exile, underground, or friendly quisling) of the\r\n  civilians addressed.\r\n\r\n  (2) Newspapers in air format, reduced in scale, but with a heavy\r\n  proportion of the normal peacetime features of the audience's own\r\n  press.\r\n\r\n  (3) Novelty materials appealing to children, who are apt to be among\r\n  the most industrious collectors of leaflets, disseminating them far\r\n  and wide with less danger of reprisal from the occupying power or the\r\n  police than adults might face. (Good adult leaflets are as interesting\r\n  to children as are leaflets especially designed for them. The use of\r\n  color printing, vivid illustrations, pictures of air battles,\r\n  how-it-works diagrams of weapons, and so forth, may reach the teen-age\r\n  audience best if it gives no indication of being aimed at them.)\r\n\r\n  (4) Gifts--soap, salt, needles, matches, chocolate and similar\r\n  articles dropped to civilian populations. (This demonstrates the\r\n  wealth and benevolence of the giver. Countermeasures to enemy use of\r\n  this type of propaganda consist of dropping a few duplicates of his\r\n  gifts, containing poison-ivy soap, nauseating salt, infected-looking\r\n  needles, explosive chocolate, etc. The Germans are reported to have\r\n  followed this procedure against the American air gifts dropped to\r\n  Italy and France. With the avoidance or the spoilage of gifts, the\r\n  propaganda effect becomes so confused that both sides find it worth\r\n  desisting for a while.)\r\n\r\n  (5) Appeals to women. (Women, statistically, are around 50% of the\r\n  population of any country. With the diversion of men to fighting\r\n  operations the percentage of women in the home population rises and in\r\n  wartime it may become 60% or 70%. They face social and economic\r\n  problems much more immediately than do men because the responsibility\r\n  for maintaining homes and children normally falls on them. Evidence\r\n  of humane intentions, of reluctance to wage the most cruel forms of\r\n  war, of attempts to help civilians escape unnecessary danger, can\r\n  bring women into the participating enemy group for relaying\r\n  propaganda.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pamphlets.= Where air-dropping facilities are plentiful, leaflets can\r\nbe supplemented by pamphlets. Pamphlets have the advantage of giving the\r\npropagandist more space for texts or pictures, enabling him to tackle\r\nenemy arguments in detail or in depth. Pamphlets can present sustained\r\narguments, and thus come closer to meeting the domestic propaganda\r\nfacilities of the enemy on even ground. They are especially useful in\r\ncountering or neutralizing those enemy arguments which depend either on\r\nformal argument or on misapplied statistics, and which therefore require\r\npoint-by-point confutation.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet shown in figure 6 is an excellent example of the medium.\r\nThough it carries a complex message, it can be read by persons at the\r\nlowest educational level. It meets enemy propaganda over a whole range\r\nof themes. It is apt to be disseminated farther, whether initial\r\ndistribution be by ground or by air.\r\n\r\nUnlike the leaflet, the pamphlet is sometimes hard to conceal. For well\r\npoliced areas, it must be supplied with a protective disguise if it is\r\nto be passed along. One ingenious pamphlet made up by Dennis McEvoy and\r\nDon Brown at OWI for dropping on the Japanese, started out with a\r\nwarning: \"_Enemy!_ Warning! This is an Enemy Publication, issued by the\r\nUnited States Government. Finder is Commanded to take this to the\r\nNearest Police Station Immediately! _Enemy!_\" The pamphlet gave a\r\ngeneral statement of Japan's bad war position, _and was addressed to\r\nJapanese policemen and police officials_. The cover urged the policemen\r\nnot to keep the pamphlet, nor to destroy it, but to pass it on up\r\nthrough channels to their superiors as an instance of enemy propaganda.\r\n(We never found out what the Japanese police actually did when they got\r\nthese.)\r\n\r\nOne Japanese black leaflet assumed the proportions of a book, and was\r\nmade up in the familiar format of the pocket-sized twenty-five-cent\r\nvolumes. With a New York dateline, a copyright notice, and even a\r\nprinters' union label all neatly falsified, the book expressed\r\nopposition to Roosevelt's war. It was circulated by the Japanese as a\r\ncaptured enemy book, presumably, in order to convince their own people\r\nand their Asiatic associates that opposition to World War II existed\r\nwithin the United States itself.\r\n\r\nAlmost all belligerents issued malingerer's handbooks during the war.\r\nThese started out with statements that the medical control system was\r\ninadequate, that each man had to look out for himself, and that feigned\r\nsickness was often the only alternative to real sickness. Disguised as\r\nentertainment booklets, \"instructions\" accompanying medicine, or even as\r\nofficial handbooks (of the enemy government) for this and that purpose,\r\nthe leaflets gave detailed instructions on how to fake tuberculosis,\r\nheart trouble, and other diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Subversive Operations.= Propaganda to friendly civilians whose country\r\nhas been overrun by the enemy can be effectively promoted by\r\ncollaboration with local patriots--unless political considerations\r\nprevent such collaboration. This type of operation requires careful\r\ncooperation between propaganda (overt), subversive facilities, and\r\nintelligence personnel. World War II saw the type used on all fronts.\r\nThe Japanese made especially bold use of it during the conquest of\r\nMalaya, the occupation of Burma, and the Chinese Railway Campaigns of\r\n1944. Natives on the enemy side were regarded by us as quislings; the\r\nJapanese honored them as patriots and duped them effectively.\r\n\r\nBold black propaganda operations can often embarrass the enemy. The\r\ndropping of a few hundred tons of well counterfeited currency would tend\r\nto foul up any fiscal system. Peacetime counterfeiters operate with poor\r\nmaterials, secretly, and in small shops. When instructed, a government\r\nagency can do an astoundingly good job of counterfeiting. The United\r\nStates is on the vulnerable side of this operation, because our money\r\nhappens to be the most trusted and most widely hoarded in the world.\r\nVarious governments are believed to have run off substantial numbers of\r\nUnited States twenty and fifty dollar bills. A less offensive operation\r\nconsists of giving the enemy populace sets of ration cards, along with\r\nsimple suggestions on how to finish the forging job so as to make it\r\nconvincing. The Nazis were especially subject to this kind of attack,\r\nsince German methodical bookkeeping required a large number of documents\r\nto be in the possession of each citizen. Falsification of any of these\r\nmade the German officials go mad with confusion.\r\n\r\nTo a country suffering from too much policing, the transmission by black\r\npropaganda of facsimile personal-identity cards in large numbers would\r\nbe welcomed by many common citizens and would keep the enemy police\r\nprocedure at a high pitch of futile haste. The essence of this, as of\r\nall good black propaganda, is to confuse the enemy authorities while\r\nwinning the thankfulness of the enemy people--preferably while building\r\nup the myth within the enemy country that large, well-organized groups\r\nof revolutionists are ready to end the war when their time comes.\r\n\r\nIf white propaganda is to be compared to incendiary bombing, in that it\r\nultimately affects the enemy armed services by disorganizing the\r\nhomeland behind them, black propaganda may be compared to the tinfoil\r\nstrips used in anti-radar. Black propaganda strikes directly at enemy\r\nsecurity. It gives him too much to do, and thus increases the chances\r\nfor agents down on the ground to succeed in their lonely, dangerous\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Motion Pictures.= In consolidated areas, allied or neutral territory,\r\nand the home jurisdiction, motion pictures for civilians can be employed\r\nas a major propaganda instrument. The combination of visual and auditory\r\nappeal ensures a concentration of attention not commanded by other\r\nmedia. In both World Wars, the U.S. made extensive use of film.\r\n\r\nProcurement can be either through direct governmental manufacture of the\r\nfinished product, or by subcontracting to nongovernmental agencies.\r\nPropaganda films normally make a point of displaying the military\r\nprowess and civic virtue of the distributor.\r\n\r\nOfficially distributed films are, however, almost always overshadowed by\r\npure entertainment films. The wartime official movie can penetrate no\r\ndeeper than can the unofficial picture. Financial and commercial\r\ncontrol, plus censorship, limits the periphery into which motion-picture\r\nshowings can be extended. Often the private film will be shown when a\r\npublic one would be suppressed. And in time of peace, the propaganda\r\nmovie has ever sharper competition from its private competitors. Few\r\npropaganda movies have ever achieved the spectacular impact of some\r\nprivate films in portraying the American way of life. Tahitians, Kansu\r\nmen, Hindus and Portuguese would probably agree unanimously in\r\npreferring the USA of Laurel and Hardy to the USA of strong-faced men\r\nbuilding dams and teaching better chicken-raising.\r\n\r\nOnly rarely does the cinema penetrate enemy territory or reach\r\nclandestine audiences. Its direct contribution to critical-zone\r\npsychological warfare is therefore slight. Perhaps television may in\r\ncourse of time combine attention-holding with transmissibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13\r\n\r\nOperations Against Troops\r\n\r\n\r\nIn every instance of systematic American use of psychological warfare\r\nagainst enemy troops during World War II, affirmative results were\r\ndiscerned after the operation had been in effect for a short while.\r\nFigure 46 shows the consummation of the troop propaganda program; these\r\nGermans are surrendering and they carry the Allied leaflets with them.\r\nBy the latter phases of the liberation of France, 90 per cent of the\r\nenemy prisoners reported that they had seen or possessed Allied leaflets\r\nand the most famous leaflet of them all, the celebrated _Passierschein_\r\n(see figure 4) came to be as familiar to the Germans as their own paper\r\nmoney.[41] Since every enemy who surrenders is one less man to root out\r\nor destroy at a cost of life to one's own side, the sharp upswing of\r\nenemy surrenders was a decided military gain.\r\n\r\nTwo separate types of psychological reaction are to be sought in the\r\nenemy soldier's mind. The first consists of a general lowering of his\r\nmorale or efficiency even when he is not in a position to perform any\r\novert act, such as surrendering, which would hurt his side and help\r\nours. This may be called MO, or morale operations. The second type of\r\naction is overt action (surrendering, deserting his post of duty,\r\nmutinying) which can be induced only if the appeal is expertly timed.\r\n\r\nOperations against troops must be based on the objective military\r\nsituation. Suffering and exertion increase realism; plain soldiers are\r\nnot apt to be talked over by propaganda unless the propaganda is\r\ncarefully cued to their actual situation. All propaganda should be based\r\non fact; propaganda to troops must be based not merely on fact, but must\r\nshow shrewd appreciative touches of understanding the troops' personal\r\nconditions. Propaganda is not much use to a nation undergoing abject\r\ndefeat, for the troops on the victorious side will be buoyed up by the\r\naffirmation of victory from their own eyes.\r\n\r\nTroop propaganda must therefore aim at eventual willing _capture_ of the\r\nindividual--not at surrender by his individual initiative. It must\r\nimplant the notion that he may eventually be trapped, and that _if_ that\r\nhappens he should give up. The propaganda must not meet the soldier's\r\nloyalty in a head-on collision but must instead give the enemy soldier\r\nthe opportunity of rationalizing himself out of the obligations of\r\nloyalty (\"true loyalty requires survival and therefore surrender\"). The\r\nsteps, therefore, needed for good propaganda to actual combat troops\r\ninclude the following:\r\n\r\n  first, the notion that the enemy soldier may have to surrender as his\r\n  side loses or retreats (\"other [named] units have surrendered, with\r\n  so-and-so many men; you will have to, too\");\r\n\r\n  second, themes which make the enemy soldier believe that an all-out\r\n  effort is wasted or misapplied;\r\n\r\n  third, the idea that he or his unit may find themselves in a hopeless\r\n  situation soon;\r\n\r\n  fourth, identifying the next authentically bad situation with the\r\n  \"hopeless\" situation;\r\n\r\n  fifth, concrete instructions for the actual surrender.[42]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 52: Basic Types: Troop Morale._ Leaflets may be\r\naimed at (1) morale, (2) news, (3) action. Morale leaflets neither\r\ncommunicate news nor call for specific action. Rather, they pave the way\r\nfor action. Many of the previous illustrations have been of this type.\r\nThis one is a troop morale leaflet used by the puppet Free India Army on\r\ntheir own men, who were discouraged by the self-evident lack of matériel\r\nand numbers. (Singapore, about 1944.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Morale Operations.= Morale operations in the black field are, for the\r\nAmerican record, still a closed book. German black operations against\r\nthe French included such enterprises as sending French soldiers letters\r\nfrom their home towns telling them that their wives were committing\r\nadultery or were infected with venereal diseases, or calling out names\r\nand unit designations to French troops facing them in the Maginot Line,\r\nor giving away mourning dresses to women who would wear them on the\r\nstreets of Paris, or intercepting telephone communications in the field\r\nand giving confusing or improper orders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 53: Paired Morale Leaflets._ The Christmas card\r\nshowing the Nativity was dropped by General MacArthur's psychological\r\nwarfare people on the Filipinos. The Christmas cards with bells were\r\nprepared by the Japanese for the U.S. Army. The former were designed to\r\ncheer on the Filipinos; the latter, to depress the Americans with the\r\ndefeatist messages inside the cards.]\r\n\r\nMorale operations on the white side included such items as the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  Sending mournful poetry leaflets to Japanese units which were known to\r\n  be demoralized for lack of home furlough (China Theater);\r\n\r\n  Dropping beautiful colored pictures of luscious Japanese victuals on\r\n  starving troops (North Burma);\r\n\r\n  Showing the Japanese Sad Sack in a cartoon, fighting everywhere while\r\n  his officers get all the liquor, all the food, all the girls, and all\r\n  the glory, while the common soldier ends up cremated (Southwest\r\n  Pacific);\r\n\r\n  Demonstrating that the Nazi pets on the German High Command have\r\n  disrupted the splendid German military tradition and have thrown out\r\n  the really competent professional generals (Soviet-German front);\r\n\r\n  Pinning the nickname, _Der Sterber_ (roughly, \"Old\r\n  Let's-go-get-killed!\"), on a German general who had boasted of his\r\n  willingness to expend personnel (Anglo-American and Soviet radio);\r\n\r\n  Telling the German troops they were dying for a cause already lost\r\n  (Italy);\r\n\r\n  Reporting back to the Germans the statements made by prisoners, to the\r\n  effect they were damned glad that they were out of the fighting\r\n  (France);\r\n\r\n  Telling the Japanese on Attu and Kiska that just as surely as the\r\n  _kiri_ leaf, symbol of death, would fall in the autumn, they too would\r\n  fall (North Pacific);\r\n\r\n  Telling the Japanese homeland and troops that the Japanese Emperor had\r\n  loved peace but that the militarists had dragged the Sacred Empire\r\n  into war (\"Peaceful is Morning in the Shrine Garden\" leaflet; designed\r\n  for Aleutians, used over Japan);\r\n\r\n  Telling the Chinese in China that the Americans would soon cut the\r\n  Japanese conquered empire in two with Asiatic landings, and then\r\n  dropping the leaflet, written in simple Chinese which could be figured\r\n  out by Japanese, on the Japanese troops (China);\r\n\r\n  Congratulating imaginary agents in ostensible code over the voice\r\n  radio for the excellent work they have allegedly done in the enemy\r\n  home country (all theaters).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 54: Troop Morale Leaflet, Grey._ This German\r\nleaflet from the Italian front attempts to remind American troops of the\r\nbonus troubles of 1932--a year in which most of the American soldiers\r\nwere still in school. Only to older men could the appeal carry much\r\nweight. The drawing and typography are distinctively German. In terms of\r\nsource, this leaflet is grey.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 55: Chinese Communist Civilian Morale Leaflet._\r\nThis leaflet attempts to raise peasant morale while calling in general\r\nterms for economic action. It shows a peasant family welcoming home the\r\nfather, who has been made a Hero of Labor. (Given the author by\r\nPolitical Department, Border Area Government, at Yenan in September\r\n1944.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 56: General Morale: Matched Themes._ The American\r\nleaflet and Japanese one both show the same map with the same\r\nevent--cutting of the enemy lifeline. In each case, the event is alleged\r\nto be news. However, the purpose of the leaflet is to depress the morale\r\nof all enemies who see it and to raise the morale of all friends.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 57: The Unlucky Japanese Sad Sack._ This morale\r\npamphlet was used on the Japanese in South and Southwest Pacific. While\r\nit never produced any startling results on them, it did no harm. The\r\npictures are done by a qualified Japanese artist. The pamphlet tells the\r\nstory of the Japanese common soldier whose officers get everything and\r\ngive him nothing except a cremation box and memorial tablet.]\r\n\r\nThe category \"morale leaflets\" covers all leaflets which neither call\r\nfor immediate action, nor are designed primarily to convey news as such.\r\n\r\n\r\n=News Leaflets.= Figures 1, 7, 59, 60 and 65 are news leaflets. The\r\npropaganda purpose is evident, even to the enemy. But in the best of\r\nthese leaflets there is a tendency to let the facts speak for\r\nthemselves, and to show the enemy just what the actual situation is.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tactical Defensive Psychological Warfare.= Morale operations are\r\ndesigned, therefore, to obtain responses other than immediate action.\r\nSeveral possible goals can be sought, singly or jointly. The commonest\r\nis preparation of the enemy soldier's mind for the actual physical act\r\nof surrender, the moral act of doing no more for his own side. Whenever\r\nsurrender requires nothing more than passivity, morale leaflets are even\r\nmore promising; in such cases all that is asked of the enemy is that he\r\nsit tight, fight inefficiently, and put up his hands when he is told to\r\ndo so. Other purposes of morale operations include the irritation of\r\nenemy groups against each other, the general depression of enemy morale,\r\nthe discouragement of enemy troops, officers or commanders.\r\n\r\nMorale operations, to be effective, must be aimed at the actual,\r\nspecific morale with which they are concerned. Well fed troops cannot be\r\nfrightened by the remote prospect of starvation. Well officered troops\r\ncannot be induced to mutiny. Troops with good mail service cannot be\r\nmade homesick. However, weak points in the enemy organization can and do\r\nprovide targets for morale operations. The defeat situation imposes\r\ntremendous strain on both the individual soldier and on officers in\r\npositions of responsibility. At such times, disunity rises to the\r\nsurface, rumors spread more readily, and propaganda operations against\r\nmorale can have devastating effect. (Allied psychological warfare\r\nagainst Germans in 1944-45 was aimed both at general officers and at the\r\nmass of the German troops--operations against the officers being founded\r\non the common-sense premise that if large-scale German surrenders were\r\nsought, they could best be obtained by influencing those Germans who had\r\nthe authority to surrender.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 58: Civilian Personal Mail._ A common stunt in\r\nblack or grey morale propaganda is the printing of facsimile personal\r\nletters. The letter shown at left is given in the original German form,\r\nalong with its English twin which was--as usual--prepared for\r\nadministrative clearance, records, and information. (Europe, Allied,\r\n1944-45.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 59: Basic Types: Newspapers._ Newspapers were\r\nprepared by almost every belligerent for almost every other. The\r\nexamples shown above are Luftpost (SHAEF for Germans) and Rakkasan News\r\n(USAFPA for Japanese). Each newspaper copies the form of enemy civilian\r\nnewspapers. The gross circulation of these airborne papers reached in\r\nsome cases up into the millions.]\r\n\r\nA curious point developed. German morale in the higher grades was worse\r\nthan in the lower. In the very last year of the war, despite the\r\nterrible air raids on their homeland behind them, the German troops on\r\nthe Western front underwent only slight morale deterioration--in\r\ncomparison with what they should have undergone had their morale borne a\r\ndirect relationship to the strategic position of Germany as a whole. On\r\nthe other hand, the morale among general officers and staff officers\r\nbecame wretched. The _putsch_ of the generals the previous summer was\r\nmerely a foretaste of the demoralization of the German higher command.\r\n\r\nThis unusual situation arose from the fact that the National Socialist\r\npropaganda machinery was still working on the masses of the troops. The\r\npolitical officers still made speeches. The troops were given pep talks,\r\ninformation about the war (hopelessly distorted information, but\r\ninformation none the less), and promises of privileges and comforts\r\nwhich--while they rarely materialized--were cheering. Simultaneously,\r\nGerman army discipline in the Prussian tradition, never known to be\r\nwishy-washy or weak, was sharply stiffened. Furthermore, the plain\r\nsoldiers carried over to the months of defeat those propaganda attitudes\r\nwhich they had been taught in the prewar and war years by Hitler's\r\nincessant domestic propaganda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 60: Basic Types: Spot News Leaflets._ Spot news\r\noften makes better propaganda if handled while still fresh than if\r\ncarried in newspapers or morale leaflets later on. The examples above\r\nwere used against the Germans. News is given on one side of the leaflet,\r\nand is dropped while the news is still news; the other side has a\r\npropaganda appeal reading, in effect, \"You must choose for yourself. Die\r\nfor the Party or live for yourself!\"]\r\n\r\nIn contrast with common troops, the officers had the professional skill\r\nto understand the advantages possessed by the Allied armies. The\r\nofficers knew enough about global and continental strategy, about the\r\nimmediate strategy of the Western front, about economic factors and so\r\non, to see that the situation was genuinely bad. Furthermore, the\r\nofficer class had been less indoctrinated in the first place--many of\r\nthem having personally despised the Nazis while welcoming Naziism as a\r\nmeans of getting the \"cattle,\" the common people, into line behind the\r\nWehrmacht--and those of them concerned with propaganda naturally became\r\ncritical of all propaganda, including their own government's, and\r\ncommunicated their criticisms to their brother officers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 61: Basic Types: Civilian Action._ Desired\r\ncivilian action can often be obtained by the use of clear instructions\r\ntransmitted in leaflet form. This leaflet calls on the people of Alsace,\r\nLorraine and Luxembourg to stay away from German communication lines,\r\nnot to work for the Germans, and to make careful notes of atrocities\r\nwhich the Germans may commit.]\r\n\r\nGerman defenses against Allied psychological warfare worked. The German\r\ntroops fought on when they had no business fighting, when their own\r\ngenerals thought it was time to quit and held out only because the S.S.\r\nand Gestapo promised ready death to any high officer who even whispered\r\nthe word, \"Defeat!\"\r\n\r\nThis German defensive success was based on two factors:\r\n\r\n  (1) The good condition of the German troops in terms of food, supply,\r\n  communications, and weapons;\r\n\r\n  (2) The coordination of all morale services for the purpose of\r\n  defensive psychological warfare.\r\n\r\nA common _Landser_, tough and ready in a whole division full of well\r\nfed, well armed men, could not be expected to undergo despair because\r\nfreight-car loadings hundreds of miles away had dropped to zero. He\r\nmight see that the Luftwaffe was less in evidence; he might grumble\r\nabout mail, or about having to use horse transport, but as long as he\r\ncould see that his own unit was getting on all right, it was hard to\r\npersuade him that defeat was around the corner. In World War I, the\r\nGerman troops at the time of surrender _were_ much better off than most\r\nof them thought they were; in World War II, they _thought_ they were\r\nbetter off than they actually were. The Germans may not have been in\r\nperfect shape, but they were incomparably better off than the starving\r\nscarecrows with whom Generalissimo Chiang was trying to hold back the\r\nJapanese in West Hunan or the Americans who had fought despair, fever\r\nand Japanese--all three at once--on Bataan.\r\n\r\nAlong with their relatively good immediate condition, which masked and\r\nhid from them the strategic deterioration of the Reich to their rear,\r\nthe German troops had the services of morale officers who were actually\r\ndefensive psychological warfare operators.\r\n\r\nIn some units (more on the Eastern front than the Western) the Germans\r\nhad _PK_ units--_Propagandakompanie_, or propaganda companies. These\r\nwere organizationally very interesting. They combined the functions of a\r\ncombat propaganda company--printing, radio work, interrogation of\r\nprisoners, etc.--with the job of morale builders. Their services were\r\navailable not only for use against the enemy, but for aid to the German\r\ntroops themselves. Since they were currently informed of Allied\r\npropaganda lines, they were able to distribute counteracting propaganda\r\nat short notice and were even capable, on occasion, of forestalling\r\nAllied propaganda themes in advance.\r\n\r\nDefensive psychological warfare in the Wehrmacht and, so far as it is\r\nknown from Russian articles and fiction, in the Red Army as well,\r\ndepended on unit-by-unit indoctrination with contempt of the enemy,\r\nmistrust of his news facilities, fear of his political aims, and hatred\r\nfor the whole enemy mentality. Propaganda officers, countersubversive\r\noperatives, public relations men, and information-education officers\r\nwere either in the same office or were in fact the same men. Combination\r\nof functions made possible the use of flexible counteracting propaganda.\r\n\r\nMost of this counteracting propaganda was not counterpropaganda,\r\ntechnically speaking. It was not designed against _Allied_ propaganda,\r\nbut for _German_ morale. Morale-building was not left to occasional\r\nrecreational facilities, newspapers for troops, USO entertainment and\r\nthe like, but was compelled through the use of internal espionage,\r\naffirmative presentation of the German case, and unified informational\r\noperations. This German tactical defensive psychological warfare was\r\nneither a total success nor a total failure; insofar as it helped the\r\nWehrmacht hold out, it aided the last-ditch Nazi war effort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 62: Basic Types: Labor Recruitment._ On occasion,\r\ncivilian labor becomes a highly critical factor even in an area of\r\nactive operations. Leaflets can urge labor to strike against the enemy;\r\nthey can also induce labor to come over and get to work. This leaflet\r\nwas dropped on the Burmese, Shans, and Kachins, showing all the good\r\nthings of life, promising high wages and bonuses and adding that,\r\nanyhow, it was patriotic. Come work for the Allies!]\r\n\r\nThe American army did not employ defensive psychological warfare in\r\nWorld War II. Troop indoctrination was extremely spotty. American morale\r\nremained good, not because it was _made_ good by professionals who knew\r\ntheir job, but because Providence and the American people had brought up\r\na generation of young men who started out well and--since the situation\r\nnever approached hopelessness--kept on going with their spirits high.\r\n\r\nFor the future, the American and British armies face the problem of\r\ndevising arrangements whereby within the limits of a free society\r\nsoldiers can be affirmatively indoctrinated in the course of operations.\r\nUSO, Red Cross, public relations, information and education at home,\r\nmorale staffs in the theaters, Armed Forces Radio Service, OWI, the\r\nAmerican press and the overseas military papers--these went their\r\nseparate and uncorrelated ways without doing any harm, _last time_. If\r\nthe next war starts, as it may, with an initial interchange of\r\nterrifying strategic bombardments, the morale situation may be\r\ninherently less healthy. Wise planning would provide, perhaps, a single\r\nchain of command for public relations, military propaganda and morale\r\nservices--extending this all the way down to the platoon, if\r\nnecessary--to make sure that the \"national line\" on any given topic is\r\nexplained, presented, repeated, and (if necessary) enforced.\r\n\r\nSuch defensive psychological warfare might work against sensational\r\nenemy black operations, against attempted political division, and\r\nagainst fabrication of the news--provided it was carried out in an\r\nexpert fashion. It could not change morale deterioration resulting from\r\npractical deterioration within the troop unit itself, except to\r\ndecelerate the rate of decline. It would not make up for poor\r\nleadership. Nothing makes up for poor leadership.\r\n\r\nDefensive psychological warfare at higher levels remains a\r\nself-contradiction. As pointed out above (page 159), good psychological\r\nwarfare is never directed merely against other psychological warfare. It\r\nis directed at the mind of the target audience, at _creating_ attitudes\r\nof belief or doubt which lead to the desired action. Getting and keeping\r\nattention is one of its major missions, and psychological warfare which\r\nstarts by fixing attention on the enemy presentation is doomed from the\r\nstart. One of the most conspicuous examples of this was President\r\nRoosevelt's sensational message of 15 April 1939, addressed personally\r\nto the German Chancellor, Hitler, asking that Hitler promise not to\r\ninvade 31 countries which Roosevelt listed by name. Defensive in tone,\r\nthe message gave Hitler the chance to answer over the German world-wide\r\nradio while his Reichstag laughed its derision and applause. President\r\nRoosevelt's message was decent, sane, humane; it was inspiring to the\r\npeople who already agreed with him; but it created no attitude in the\r\nGermans to whom it was addressed. A sharp, bullying, implicitly\r\nthreatening speech from President Roosevelt might have penetrated the\r\nGerman mentality of the time, even Hitler's; reasonable reproach did not\r\nwork. It was not aimed at creating any specific emotional reaction in\r\nthe _German_ mind.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be mentioned that defensive psychological warfare must\r\ninclude countersubversion and counterespionage. The Cheka--Soviet secret\r\npolice in its first form--once boasted that \"capitalist trouble-makers\r\nand saboteurs\" could not long function in Russia because the\r\ncountersubversive police were over a hundred million strong. What they\r\nmeant was that they had trained and bullied the population into\r\nreporting anyone and everyone who seemed out of line. An attitude of\r\npopular cooperation with countersubversive agencies can be achieved only\r\nwhen those agencies are efficient, respected, and properly presented to\r\nthe public. Psychological warfare can defend its homeland against enemy\r\noperations in kind only if it creates an awareness of propaganda and\r\nmakes the public critical of attitudes or opinions adverse to national\r\npolicy. Inexpert official tactics, or the general denunciation of\r\ndissent, makes the citizen believe, with Mr. Bumble in _Oliver Twist_,\r\nthat \"... the law is a ass, a idiot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Role of Small-Unit Commanders.= Unless a small-unit commander happens\r\nto command a unit which includes a Psychological Warfare team, he will\r\nhave no active Psychological Warfare role. Psychological Warfare\r\noperations require the services of experts, and it would be easy for a\r\nsmall-unit commander to jeopardize the propaganda effort of an entire\r\nfront by well meant but ill conceived interference in Psychological\r\nWarfare operations.\r\n\r\nWhere the unit does include a Psychological Warfare team, a duality of\r\ncontrol arises. This requires good sense to keep in balance. The\r\ncommander possesses absolute command and responsibility for the\r\nmovement, protection, and operations timing of the team which happens to\r\nbe attached to his unit. He should not presume to interfere in the\r\nspecial propaganda instructions flowing down to the team from superior\r\nPsychological Warfare echelons. Because of the pressing needs of\r\npropaganda operatives for news and for order-of-battle intelligence, it\r\nis normally desirable that they have their own signal facilities and\r\nthat their routine operational communications short-circuit normal\r\nmilitary channels. Otherwise, the unit's signal facilities will be\r\noverloaded with messages important to the Psychological Warfare team,\r\nbut useless to the unit as a whole. Such absurdities as the encipherment\r\nand decipherment of routine enemy news digests should by all means be\r\navoided. On the other hand, the command and administrative messages\r\nshould go through normal military channels. In the Galahad operation\r\nagainst the Japanese in North Burma, in which Merrill's Marauders\r\nparticipated, such a double set of communications channels took a long\r\ntime to develop.\r\n\r\nWhere the small-unit commander does not possess professionally trained\r\nand equipped Psychological Warfare facilities, he should no more expect\r\nto engage in offensive Psychological Warfare than to undertake chemical\r\nwarfare with improvised materials. It becomes his responsibility to turn\r\nto liaison.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Field Liaison.= One of the new roles developed within the Army during\r\nWorld War II was that of \"Psychological Warfare Liaison Officer.\" Such\r\nmen were either commissioned officers, usually of company grade, who had\r\nbeen given appropriate training, or were uniformed civilians detailed\r\nfrom OWI or OSS. It is the job of the liaison officer to become\r\nacquainted, as far down the echelon of command as may be necessary, with\r\nthe commanders whom he is to service. He must at the same time retain an\r\nintimate knowledge of the personnel, procedures and facilities of the\r\nPsychological Warfare unit from which he is detached. His position must\r\nbe compared to that of a salesman, who should know his product, his\r\ncompany, his sales manager, and his customers, all equally well. The\r\nliaison officer should be able to explain to small-unit commanders what\r\nPsychological Warfare can do for them, and he should learn to\r\ndiscriminate between high-priority and low-priority requests for PW\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nFor example, a well trained liaison officer might receive a call from a\r\nregimental or battalion commander. He would find that the commander\r\ndesired leaflets to be used in a particular tactical situation. He\r\nshould be able to explain what standard ready-prepared leaflets were\r\navailable, what delay would be involved in making up special leaflets,\r\nand what quantities of leaflets would be advisable. Turning back to his\r\nhome headquarters, he should be able to present the commander's case to\r\nthe leaflet printers or the public-address team, and should help the\r\npropaganda people in understanding the commander's problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mechanics of Liaison.= The mechanics of liaison depend in each case on\r\nthe Psychological Warfare unit. Some had extensive networks of liaison\r\nofficers; others had virtually none. In China during 1943-44, the most\r\nminor tactical request for a leaflet had to be channeled all the way\r\nback to Theater Forward Echelon Headquarters, because the political\r\nsituation was so touchy, the Chinese language so difficult, printing\r\nfacilities so scarce, and qualified personnel so rare that there was no\r\npoint in having channels cut across lower down. In France and Belgium,\r\nduring 1944-45, Psychological Warfare units were established on a\r\nconsiderable scale at the army level, and liaison officers were widely\r\nscattered; it was possible for regimental or battalion commanders to\r\nmake direct requests of liaison officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Radio Support.= On rare occasions, it becomes possible for radio\r\nsupport to be given a specific unit. The American standard-wave\r\nbroadcasting station was set up in the vicinity of Lorient while that\r\nFrench port, still held by the Nazis, was under American siege. The\r\n_History of the 2d Mobile Broadcasting Company_[43] describes the\r\noperation as being\r\n\r\n  ... the first attempt to coordinate artillery, leaflet and radio\r\n  propaganda. The station had learned the location of the billets of\r\n  various [Nazi] units in the town, together with the names of their key\r\n  personnel. With this information, a \"game\" was arranged with the\r\n  artillery. One day, at a certain time, these units were addressed by\r\n  name and their members were told to go outside their buildings and\r\n  five minutes later they would receive a message. Precisely, five\r\n  minutes later, leaflet shells released the messages advising\r\n  surrender. The ability of the Americans to do things like that\r\n  impressed the German soldiers with their hopeless position more than\r\n  words.\r\n\r\nObviously, such an operation required close contact with the enemy, plus\r\nknown possession of standard-wave radio receivers by enemy personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Air Support.= Normal communications channels, such as might be used for\r\nair-ground combat liaison, form one of the most valuable aids to the\r\nsmall unit. From time to time it is possible either for the unit to make\r\nup the leaflets (if it has a PW team) and to request their dropping by\r\nthe associated air unit, or else to make a direct request to the\r\nappropriate higher Psychological Warfare headquarters, asking that the\r\nheadquarters not only make up the leaflet but arrange for its dropping\r\nat a stated time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Leaflet-Discharging Weapons.= The airplane was far and away the most\r\nimportant leaflet-distributing device. In the CBI Theater, there was\r\ndeveloped a leaflet belly-tank of local design for use on pursuit\r\nplanes. The belly-tank was converted to a leaflet-throwing machine.\r\nAdjustment of the controls could regulate the speed at which leaflets\r\nwere discharged, so that the pilot could give enemy units or\r\ninstallations bursts of leaflets in precisely the same way that he would\r\nstrafe them with machine guns. This, however, was exceptional, owing to\r\nthe tremendous dispersion of the Japanese in the jungle and the need to\r\nconserve leaflets. In most instances, the leaflet bomb or leaflet box\r\nwas the standard Air Force method of distributing leaflets.\r\n\r\nAmong the ground weapons used for discharge of leaflets, there are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  chemical warfare shells converted to leaflet use, especially smoke\r\n  shells;\r\n\r\n  almost every variety of available artillery shell (howitzers having\r\n  proved especially useful);\r\n\r\n  rifle grenades converted for leaflets;\r\n\r\n  leaflet bundles with a small quantity of explosive, attached to a\r\n  quick fuze, packed so as to be thrown in a manner similar to the\r\n  manual throwing of a grenade.\r\n\r\nMortars were probably the chief leaflet-throwing device on both the\r\nEuropean and Asiatic fronts; the Germans went so far as to develop a\r\nspecial propaganda mortar. Smoke shells proved particularly easy to\r\nadapt.\r\n\r\nThe firing of leaflet shells is a responsibility of the unit possessing\r\nthe guns. Psychological Warfare teams were not issued their own guns,\r\nsave for unit protection. The actual distribution of leaflet shells was\r\neffected, taking the Fifth Army as an example, in the following manner:\r\n\r\n  The Army Combat Propaganda Team planned, cleared, printed and packed\r\n  leaflets suitable for the occasion.\r\n\r\n  The Team cleared with the Artillery Officer, Fifth Army, an agreement\r\n  for an order to use the leaflets.\r\n\r\n  The Team's own liaison officers transmit the order to the appropriate\r\n  divisions and lower echelons. The order itself prescribed the times\r\n  for picking up the leaflets from the ammunition dumps.\r\n\r\n  The Team procures the empty shells and packs them with leaflets.\r\n\r\n  The Army order allots 150 leaflet shells per division.\r\n\r\n  The Team specifies, in the order, the time-limit within which the\r\n  shells are to be used.\r\n\r\n  Corps and/or division selects the specific targets, the general target\r\n  being all enemy concentrations within range.\r\n\r\nIn smaller units, the propaganda unit would often be placed in direct\r\ncommunication with a specific artillery unit, which would be charged\r\nwith the responsibility for discharging the leaflet shells at opportune\r\ntimes. When a requesting unit asks for leaflets, and itself possesses\r\nthe guns which could fire leaflet shells, it is entirely possible for\r\nthe supplier to send leaflets ready-packed in the shells. However, even\r\nthe most rapid shell-packing job takes considerably more time than the\r\nreadying of aircraft for leaflet distribution. When it is considered\r\nthat the plane not only discharges the leaflets, but delivers them from\r\nthe supply point, all in one operation, it will be seen that close\r\nair-ground coordination will often do a quicker, bigger job of leaflet\r\nsaturation than could be achieved by the requesting, preparing,\r\ntransporting and firing of leaflet shells.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Contingencies of the Future.= This text refers to known experience.\r\nShort of turning to the field of futuristic fiction, it is impossible to\r\nprovide discussion of situations which have not been known in the\r\nAmerican Army. The experiences of the Nazis and the Japanese cannot be\r\ntaken by ourselves as wholly parallel, since those peoples, under\r\ndictatorship and rabid indoctrination, produced a different kind of army\r\nfrom the American. What should a small-unit commander do if his men\r\nthought they had been contaminated by airborne disease germs distributed\r\nby enemy bacteriological warfare planes? How should he act if his men\r\nwere told by an enemy broadcast that they would be exposed to radiation\r\nwhich would cause anemia, cancer, or death--if they did not surrender\r\nimmediately? What should he do if he finds himself cut off from all\r\nAmerican supplies, operating a lonely unit in contaminated or dangerous\r\nareas, and then discovers that his own men are the victims of enemy\r\nblack propaganda? How should he behave if his men get the idea that they\r\nare never going to be replaced, and if they suspect (either\r\nspontaneously or because of enemy action) that the unit has been\r\nabandoned by the American government and people?\r\n\r\nWhat could a commander do if a delegation called on him, right out in a\r\nzone of operations, and demanded a right to be heard? Suppose that he\r\nknew their complaints about food, rotation, danger, etc., to be\r\njustified, and knew at the same time that the enemy had subverted some\r\nof his men into being either dupes or traitors. Suppose his men\r\nprotested a lack of deep lead-lined shelters the day after enemy\r\nleaflets instructed the American soldiers to ask for such shelters.\r\nShould he treat all such enlisted men as traitors? Suppose he is faced\r\nwith the specter of political treason, subversion, and revolution?\r\nAmerican officers have not faced such problems since the days in which\r\nGeorge Washington was Commander in Chief. War after war, we have gone\r\ninto the fight with a profound confidence in our ability to win. Future\r\nwar may hold forth no such assurance. If America is injured, her troops\r\ndecimated, their homes exploded or poisoned by foreign atomic attack,\r\nbrand-new questions of psychological warfare will be posed. No living\r\nAmerican has ever had to face such problems. This is no assurance that\r\nthey will never occur. Upon the manhood, the fairness, the sheer\r\nintelligence of small-unit commanders there may fall the unexpected task\r\nof holding their units together in the face of disastrous psychological\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Surrender Leaflets.= Surrender leaflets are the infantry of the\r\npropaganda war. They go in and finish the job to which the preceding\r\nyears of radio broadcasts, the demoralization of the home front, the\r\ncampaigns of news and morale materials to troops, and the actual air,\r\nground, and sea attacks have led up.\r\n\r\nSudden use of surrender leaflets on a victorious or unprepared enemy is\r\nnot likely to take effect. The Japanese surrender leaflets dropped on\r\nthe Americans in Southwest Pacific were issued without previous\r\nmaterials readying the Americans. Furthermore, they were dropped when\r\nthe American situation was plainly improving, and when American soldiers\r\nwere not likely to be thinking about surrender in order to get\r\nindividual escape from the war.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of surrender leaflets calls for the tactical use of\r\nprinting facilities. This is the job of the combat propaganda unit, with\r\nits high-speed press, its liaison with both ground and air forces, its\r\nup-to-the-minute intelligence on enemy movements, situation, and order\r\nof battle. The enemy should be given leaflets showing him how clearly he\r\nis pinned down, identifying him, generally stripping him of the sense of\r\nsecrecy and the trust in his commanders that make it possible for him to\r\ngo on fighting. When surrender can be effected, he should be given the\r\nsimplest, plainest command the circumstances allow. In the case of the\r\nJapanese, there were difficulties on the American side about letting the\r\nJapanese come over to surrender; too many of them were suspected of\r\nhaving tucked hand grenades into their _fundoshi_. Many a Japanese\r\nstarted out for the Allied lines and failed to make his peaceful\r\nintentions plain enough. The result was a strong deterrent to other\r\nJapanese who may have been trying to decide whether they wanted to\r\nsurrender or not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 63: Action Type: Air-Rescue Facilities._ These\r\nleaflets from China Theater were designed to help the work of the\r\nFourteenth Air Force. Action called for from the civilians included the\r\nassistance of hurt flyers, the identification of Americans as allies and\r\nnot as Japanese when they parachuted to the ground, the avoidance of\r\nbridges and other bomb targets.]\r\n\r\nIt was found that the bright white leaflet with the identifying stripes\r\non it (figure 69) would be shown to our troops, who could be taught to\r\nhold their fire when they saw Japanese carrying that type of leaflet.\r\nTo the Japanese, the plainness of the surrender formula was a\r\nconsiderable help in coming over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 64: Pre-Action News._ Psychological warfare\r\nfacilities can be extremely helpful in favorable situations. One of the\r\nmost important ways of developing a favorable situation is to predispose\r\nenemy soldiers toward the idea of surrendering. News of surrender,\r\nemphasis on the comforts and relief of prisoners of war, and above all,\r\nemphasis on their numerousness can contribute to the actual act of\r\nsurrender. This newspaper looks like a newspaper, but its chief emphasis\r\nis on the extent of surrenders.]\r\n\r\nVariations on the surrender leaflet include the following devices:\r\n\r\n  Letters, with signatures blacked out, of prisoners of war who have\r\n  found conditions decent and who are enjoying rest, good care, and good\r\n  food;\r\n\r\n  Photographs, with the faces blocked out when security procedures or\r\n  the rules of war so require, showing enemy prisoners actually enjoying\r\n  the benefits of being out of the war;\r\n\r\n  Political arguments to the effect that the highest duty of the soldier\r\n  is to his country (or Emperor) and that if he dies for the sake of\r\n  some general in a foolish war, he will be denying his country a fine\r\n  postwar citizen like himself, needed for reconstruction and progress;\r\n\r\n  A list of the foods available to surrenderees (see figure 13, from\r\n  World War I);\r\n\r\n  A statement of the conditions of military imprisonment, reaffirming\r\n  the rules of the Geneva convention;\r\n\r\n  The promise that the potential prisoner will be allowed mail\r\n  communication with home;\r\n\r\n  Anger-motif, showing scum and profiteers at home, and attempting to\r\n  induce surrender by telling the soldier that he is being made a\r\n  sucker;\r\n\r\n  Obscene pictures, showing naked women, designed to make the\r\n  involuntary celibate so desirous of women that he surrenders out of\r\n  bad nerves. (Japanese idea, and did not work; the troops naturally\r\n  kept the pornography but merely despised the Japanese as queer little\r\n  people for having sent it. This type cannot be illustrated; the\r\n  Library of Congress has copies in a locked file.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 65: Direct Commands to Enemy Forces._ As the\r\nsituation develops against the enemy, it becomes possible to use\r\nleaflets to force the surrender of enemy troops by direct command. This\r\nkind of appeal is lost when enemy morale remains irrationally high\r\nbecause of a beloved commander or some other unpredictable factor, but\r\nin normal situations it either forces the enemy commander's hand or\r\nleaves him with a deteriorating force.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 66: Basic Types: Contingency Commands._ Leaflets\r\ncan be made up in advance to govern typical situations which may arise.\r\nThis \"Command to the Scattered German Troop Units\" orders all isolated\r\nGerman remnants to surrender to the nearest Allied force.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 67: Tactical Surrender Leaflets._ Enemy troops\r\noften fail to understand why they should surrender. Under such\r\ncircumstances, it is useful to send them a map, showing them plainly\r\nwhat their situation is. If misrepresentation is done at this point, it\r\nwill be at the cost of loss of credence later on. These leaflets were\r\nprepared to prevent Japanese units in the Philippines from staging\r\nlast-ditch fights after surrender of Japan. Similar maps had been used\r\nfor tactical purposes earlier.]\r\n\r\nThe effective surrender leaflet frequently turns language difficulties\r\ninto an asset. Whole series of leaflets will teach the enemy soldier how\r\nto say, \"I surrender,\" in the language of the propagandist. The words,\r\n\"Ei sörrender,\" were made familiar to every German soldier; it is simply\r\nthe phonetic spelling of English for Germans to pronounce. Surrender is\r\nnot merely a case of transferring loyalties; it is a highly dangerous\r\noperation for most infantrymen. It takes nerve if done deliberately. The\r\nvoluntary surrenderee risks being shot by some exasperated officer or\r\ncomrade on his own side; he risks court-martial for treason if his\r\nsurrender is wilful and his side wins the war; he may run into a\r\ntrigger-happy enemy who will shoot him; he may fail to make himself\r\nunderstood to the enemy. Therefore surrender leaflets try to catch some\r\nsimple procedure, to indoctrinate the enemy soldier with routine things\r\nwhich he can do when the opportunity arises. Of all leaflets, those most\r\neffective (most closely tied in with unconscious preparation for\r\neventual conscious choice) are the ones dealing specifically with\r\nconcrete treatment of prisoners of war. The surrender leaflet itself can\r\nbe used as an authorization to surrender. The enemy soldier who carries\r\na leaflet around with him, just in case he may need it, is already\r\npartially subverted from enemy service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 68: Basic Types: Surrender Leaflet._ The\r\nsurrender leaflet shown was not welcomed by the Japanese because it\r\nindicated that the Japanese soldier using it wished to surrender. This\r\nwas very vulgar and depressing indeed, and few Japanese soldiers would\r\naccept such a humiliation. Except for its wording, the leaflet is good.\r\nAs large as a big magazine cover, it is white with red and blue trim and\r\ncan be identified readily.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Action Leaflets.= In World War II there were ample opportunities\r\nto surrender on most fronts. In subsequent conflicts, however, it is\r\nquite possible that surrendering will be physically unfeasible, because\r\nthe surrenderee will have no one at hand to whom to surrender (see\r\nbelow, pages 248-250). Recourse may then be had to a type of leaflet\r\nonly occasionally used in World War II--the leaflet which calls on enemy\r\ntroops to perform some action other than surrender. The commonest of\r\nthese is desertion--when it is known that enemy forces are being held in\r\na dangerous spot by their own command, and when there is a fair\r\nprobability that heavy artillery or air attack can be concentrated on\r\nthe area which has been strewn with leaflets. (A bluff normally fails,\r\nand moreover discredits later operations of the same kind, whereas a\r\nsuccessful and fulfilled threat builds up cumulative credibility among\r\nthe enemy audience.) When long range weapons are used, it may be\r\npossible to address troops by leaflet before the attack, suggesting that\r\nthey remove themselves, as individuals, to places of safety; such an\r\noperation would assist enemy disorganization. The author knows of no\r\ncase where the Germans did this with their V-l or V-2 bombs, but figure\r\n3 applied to both civilians and troops in the cities marked for\r\ndestruction by incendiary B-29 raids.\r\n\r\nBlack action appeals may teach the enemy troops how to malinger, may\r\npresent political or ethnic arguments to troops known to be members of\r\nminorities or satellite nationalities (for example, Poles in Nazi\r\nservice), with the intent that these mutiny, or may--at the very end of\r\na war--call upon enemy troops as units to cease resistance and to await\r\na later opportunity for organized surrender.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Loudspeaker Units.= The use of the amplified human voice developed\r\nslowly in World War II. Improvised units were set up in North Africa,\r\nin the Italian landings, at Anzio, and in the Normandy operations. At\r\ntimes these talked over valuable groups of enemy prisoners, but their\r\nrange did not go beyond two hundred yards, which sharply limited their\r\nutility. The Navy was simultaneously experimenting with Polly Planes in\r\nthe Pacific, which flew at considerable altitudes over islands and\r\ntalked to the Japanese troops on the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 69: Improved Surrender Leaflet._ The new leaflet\r\nwhich did bring the Japanese in was better phrased. It did not mention\r\nthe nasty word, _surrender_, but said, \"I Cease Resistance.\" It also\r\nshowed the Japanese how to carry the leaflet so as to persuade the\r\ntriggery Americans that he was not holding a hand grenade behind it. The\r\nback of the leaflet, instead of being left blank, showed happy Japanese\r\nprisoners enjoying American captivity, their faces left identifiable as\r\nJapanese but blanked out enough to head off individual identification.\r\nCompare this with figure 4, the Passierschein we used on the Germans.]\r\n\r\nUltimate success came with the development of loudspeakers on tank\r\nmounts. These developed a range of two miles with the result that they\r\nhad real value in combat operations. In April, 1945, a loudspeaker tank\r\nwith the XIX Corps made an average of twenty broadcasts a day during\r\naction. Short talks were given to the enemy troops just before attack.\r\nAttacks were then withheld long enough to permit prisoners to come in.\r\nThe attacks were then launched, lifted after a pause to permit more\r\nprisoners to come in, and finally pushed through. This tactic worked\r\nparticularly well at road blocks where enemy troops were flanked. In the\r\nTeutoburger Wald a whole platoon was persuaded to surrender. At\r\nHildesheim two hundred and fifty prisoners came over together. Elsewhere\r\nin the drive into Germany, the Germans came over in even greater\r\nnumbers, but the situation was then so obviously at its best for us that\r\nthey probably would have responded similarly to command banners, black\r\nwords on white background, such as the ancient Chinese imperial forces\r\nused to carry around for tactical communication with bandits and rebels.\r\n\r\nOn Okinawa tank-mounted loudspeakers were ingeniously hooked up. The\r\nAmerican tank officers and crews obviously could not speak good\r\ncolloquial Japanese. The Japanese troops were dug in like rodents, and\r\nin a condition of desperation that made them fight cruelly and\r\nsuicidally. Even if the Americans shelled the openings of their cave\r\nmouths or ran armored bulldozers over the holes, burying Japanese alive,\r\nthere was the chance that the Japanese would run through long\r\nunderground passages and pop up later, possibly at night, to cause more\r\ndamage before they were killed. With Americans and Japanese unable to\r\ntalk to one another, this condition might have led to a severe loss of\r\nAmerican life in mopping up hundreds upon hundreds of such minute\r\nJapanese strongholds. The American tanks had loudspeakers mounted on\r\nmany of them; they had radio telephone communication, that could be used\r\nbetween the different tanks on a tank team, or--it was an alternative,\r\nand could not be used simultaneously--could be employed for the\r\ncommanding tank to communicate back to headquarters.\r\n\r\nAt headquarters, American Japanese, whose American accents had been\r\ntrained out of their voices in special public-speaking classes, sat\r\nready and waiting.\r\n\r\nThe tank team would come into the valley, and the American commander\r\nwould look the situation over. He would cut his radio telephone into\r\ncommunication with headquarters, and would then say:\r\n\r\n\"Hillside ahead of me. No characterizing features. Five or six holes,\r\nbut I can't tell which ones have Japanese in them. I can get up the\r\nhill. There are two trees at the crest of the hill, and a bunch of these\r\nnative graves over on the left.\"\r\n\r\nThe American-Japanese at headquarters would say: \"Regular announcement,\r\nsir? Do you want them to assemble by the graves or at the trees?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell them to stand in front of the graves. That way they'll be coming\r\ndown hill. Want to be cut in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" says the headquarters man.\r\n\r\nThe tank commander would then cut his radiophone into a relay, and the\r\ntanks which had loudspeakers would automatically connect the loudspeaker\r\nunits direct with the radio telephone. A voice, loud as the voice of a\r\ngod, would fill the entire valley, coming from everywhere at once and\r\nspeaking good clear Japanese:\r\n\r\n\"Attention, Japanese troops, attention! This is the American tank\r\ncommander calling. I am going to destroy all resistance in this valley.\r\nAttention! I have flame-throwers. These will be used on all dugouts and\r\ncaves. Attention! Flame-throwers will be employed. Gunfire will close\r\nthe cave mouths. No Japanese personnel can expect to escape. Japanese\r\npersonnel commanded to cease resistance. Japanese personnel commanded to\r\ncease resistance. Japanese personnel must assemble in front of native\r\nburial place, to American left flank, Japanese right flank.\"\r\n\r\nThe tank commander would watch, while the loudspeakers blared. First one\r\nJapanese, then more would come in small knots to the assembly place as\r\ndirected. The commander would then cut the American-Japanese back in and\r\nsay,\r\n\r\n\"I think they're holding out on the hill crest. Try that. Just a minute\r\nor two. If they don't start coming, I'll go after them and cut you in\r\njust when I reach the top....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Which part of the hill crest, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell. Anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 70: End of War._ This leaflet helped the war to\r\nend, just as did the great leaflet which submitted the Japanese\r\nsurrender terms back to the Japanese people. On one side the leaflet\r\ncarries news from the Wehrmacht's last defeats; on the other it takes up\r\nthe future of Germany as determined by the Crimea Conference.]\r\n\r\nThe speakers would be cut back in: \"Attention, Japanese forces remaining\r\non hill crest. Japanese forces just behind us under command of Colonel\r\nMusashi surrendered last night and are now well taken care of. You are\r\nbeing given the same chance. Attention, I will soon come up the\r\nhill....\"\r\n\r\nA few more Japanese figures, small as ants on a sand dune, would come\r\ninto sight on the hill and begin clambering down to the point of\r\nsurrender.[44]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOUR\r\n\r\nPSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AFTER WORLD WAR II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14\r\n\r\nThe \"Cold War\" and Seven Small Wars\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period after 1945 has turned out to be considerably more turbulent\r\nthan most Americans expected. Though the victory over Fascism and\r\nJapanese militarism has proved to be psychologically and historically\r\ncomplete, the struggles between the victors have developed such mistrust\r\nand bitterness as to create a present-day equivalent of the Thirty\r\nYears' War, rather than a period of peace as it was understood by\r\neducated men of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nAlong with many other military and political phenomena, psychological\r\nwarfare has been thrust into a period of \"no war and no peace\" which has\r\nproved to be extraordinarily difficult for Western men to deal with\r\neither emotionally or intellectually.[45] Such phrases as Churchill's\r\nterm, \"the Iron Curtain,\" and Walter Lippmann's coinage, \"the Cold War,\"\r\nhave become a part of civilized speech throughout the world. They have\r\nobscured almost as much as they have explained. It is entirely\r\nconceivable that an adequate description of the present historical\r\nperiod will only be written after the forces now operating have ceased\r\nto be significant; at that future time it may be possible for serious\r\nand reflective men to determine what happened in the middle of the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Recognition and Delay.= One of the preeminent factors in the\r\npsychological and opinion aspect of the turmoil in the mid-twentieth\r\ncentury has been the very sharp contrast between the _time_ on which a\r\ngiven event occurred, the _delay_ between the occurrence of the event\r\nand the final understanding of that event in their own terms by the\r\nstrategic policy-makers affected, and the successful _recognition_ of\r\nthe event in policy papers looking toward a further future. The\r\npolitical and strategic character of much recent military history has\r\ntherefore been a grotesque comedy of errors--ridiculous if it were not\r\nso deadly serious--involving the lives of the major urban populations\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nAn event such as the liberation of Indochina from Japanese military\r\noccupation in 1945, met competently and reasonably by the standards of\r\nan anticipated \"world of 1946,\" which unfortunately never materialized,\r\nled to the frustrations, bloodshed, deceit, and warfare of the late\r\n1940s, and by 1954 became partially intelligible as a facet of the free\r\nworld's struggle against Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n=New Interpretations of Policy and Propaganda.= Polemic writing has been\r\ndone concerning the role of propaganda, psychological warfare,\r\npsychological strategy, and comparable operations. In many instances the\r\npolemics have involved the presentation of two sides, each of which was\r\nright--one side maintaining that the old-fashioned world of free,\r\nsovereign nations, meeting in a parliament of man as constituted in the\r\nUnited Nations, could and should use the \"realities\" of traditional\r\npower politics as a guide to the present and the future, and should\r\navoid the hopelessness, terrorism, and fanaticism of chronic ideological\r\nwar; the other side with equal merits has often argued that the\r\nideological war is here, that its deniers are the witting or unwitting\r\nsympathizers or appeasers of Communism, that their \"realities\" are\r\noutmoded, and that the United States must face up to a crusade which\r\nwill end in annihilation or death for either the Communist system or the\r\nconstitutional democratic group of states.\r\n\r\nWhat such polemics overlook is the terrifying probability that events\r\nmay happen so rapidly that no one on either the Communist or\r\nanti-Communist side is capable of assimilating a new datum, such as the\r\ndevelopment of the hydrogen bomb, the death of Stalin, or the appearance\r\nof Israel among the nations, _until well after the event has occurred_.\r\nThe occurrence of public events in all past civilizations has involved a\r\nconsiderable number of public agreements on the major hypotheses\r\nconcerned; as pointed out earlier in this book, the antagonists in older\r\nwars usually, though not always, knew what the war was about. Today the\r\nspiritual, psychological, logical, and scientific inconsistencies and\r\nparadoxes within each system are so deep as to make the definition of\r\nlong-range goals almost impossible. Any one goal, such as the\r\nestablishment of peace, the appreciation of an international system of\r\nalliances against aggression, the maintenance of national sovereignty,\r\nthe protection of a free-enterprise economy, the assurance of\r\nself-determination to non-self-governing peoples, or the like, may, _if\r\nemphasized_, contradict the concomitant goals which support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Communist and Anti-Communist Psychological Events.= Each of the two\r\nmajor systems has strengths of its own. The Communist strengths are\r\nsometimes too apparent to Americans, so much so that Americans\r\nexaggerate Communist power and overlook serious deficiencies in the\r\neconomies and the political character of the Communist group of nations.\r\nThe Communists can suppress dissidence with a fanatical party line: the\r\nprice they pay is the abrupt shifting of that line as international\r\nsituations change. The Communists can appeal to youth by their dogmatic\r\nfaith that they are the masters of the probable future of the world:\r\nthey risk much if this faith does not pay off and if the world's youth\r\nsometimes turns against them because they promise too much and deliver\r\ntoo little. The Communists operating from an allegedly material basis\r\noffer psychological and spiritual values of a perverted kind, but have\r\nvery considerable propaganda value; they give people a chance to\r\nsacrifice themselves, to work for causes greater than their individual\r\npersonalities, \"something to die for,\" and an apparent understanding of\r\nhistory: yet the Communists also risk psychological exhaustion and\r\ncynicism among their élite cadres as well as among their mass\r\nfollowings.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter, concerning strategic information operations of the\r\nUnited States Government in the foreign field, there will be further\r\ndiscussion of the psychological strengths of the free world; we will say\r\nat this point that in the light of the strategic and military contexts\r\nof the postwar period the free world has had the advantages of modesty,\r\nrelaxation, and elasticity. Among Americans, even among intelligent\r\nAmericans, it is frequent to find the assumption being made that the\r\nchief strength of the free world consists of its legal rights and its\r\ndemocratic political processes, rather than in its actual (not merely\r\nformal) toleration of many points of view and its actual relaxation of\r\nthe populations under its control.\r\n\r\nSince the free world is not committed to victory as much as is the\r\nCommunist world, it can afford more defeats without a corresponding loss\r\nof morale. Since the free world has not promised a Utopian future, it\r\ncan go from the reality of the 1950s to whatever realities the 1960s or\r\nthe 1970s may bring without a sharp letdown in morale or widespread\r\nheartbreak among its most gifted advocates. In Cold War terms the free\r\nworld is committed to fighting, but not to victory, while the Communists\r\nare committed to the actual though remote promise of triumph for their\r\nsystem throughout the world. The citizens of the United States can\r\ntherefore contemplate the survival of the USSR or its annihilation and\r\nreplacement by a democratic Russia with equanimity; their Soviet\r\nopposite numbers, group for group and class for class, cannot be as\r\ndetached from the struggle.\r\n\r\nOver all of us there hangs the entirely uncertain future raised by\r\npossible use of atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and other novel weapons--a\r\nfuture about which former Governor Adlai Stevenson felt so gloomy that\r\nhe said another war would end civilization. (The rejoinder can, of\r\ncourse, be made that if another war would end civilization anyhow, win,\r\nlose, or draw, the United States might as well disband its defense\r\nforces now and enjoy life for the few short years that remain.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Cold War.= In some respects the Cold War is not novel. It resembles\r\nthe intercivilizational wars of the past in which competing\r\ncivilizations with definite moral and political foundations fought one\r\nanother for final survival. This kind of warfare is very different\r\nindeed from struggles waged between nations which have a common\r\ncivilization and which have a common interest in the preservation of\r\nthat civilization. The Americans of the 1950s are waging a struggle much\r\nmore like that between the Protestants and Catholics in the years\r\n1618-48 than they are to the Civil War of 1861-65 or the Revolutionary\r\nWar of 1775-81. In some respects we Americans are back all the way to\r\nthe fight between the Aztecs and Cortez or the struggle between Chinese\r\nand Chams in ancient Annam. What Mr. Lippmann calls merely a Cold War is\r\nsomething deeper, bigger, and worse than any war Americans have ever\r\nknown before. The only parallel to it was the struggle between settlers\r\nand Indians on our own frontier: our battles with the Indians at least\r\nhad the advantage of never leaving us with the hideous dread that the\r\nAmerican Indians might sweep a White and Christian civilization from\r\nthis continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Nature of the Cold War.= The Cold War is therefore a struggle, the\r\nbeginnings of which can be found at any one of several dates (1848, 1917\r\nand 1943 are some of those given) which is now being waged between\r\nnon-Communist states and a Communist group of nations. No one now living\r\ncan speak with assurance of the outcome. Only the most foolhardy of\r\noptimists could visualize a world in which the better aspects of each\r\nsystem would be developed and the factors common to each would be\r\nunderscored and strengthened as supports for a peace-seeking\r\ninternational system under the UN. The struggle is larger than a war\r\nbecause it comprises pre-belligerent, belligerent, and post-belligerent\r\nactivities both in global wars and in a possible general war. On the\r\nCommunist side the techniques include sabotage, revolution, conspiracy,\r\nand fanatical organization. On the anti-Communist side a family of\r\npara-military weapons is gradually being developed and may or may not be\r\nthrown into the struggle. No war was ever as bitter or uncertain as this\r\none because war, whatever its demerits, at least commits the nations to\r\ncombat and to victory. War has the supreme merit of _decision_. The Cold\r\nWar does not: people have to fight it without knowing what it is or what\r\nthey would get out of it if they could obtain the advantage.[46]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Origins of the Cold War.= In retrospect it is easy to argue that the\r\nCommunist system has been fighting all non-Communist systems ever since\r\n1848; that the Soviet system has been in a moral condition of war with\r\nall other governments since 1917; that the democratic-Soviet alliance\r\nagainst the Fascist powers during 1941-45 was a sham and a fraud\r\ncovering a three-cornered war; and that therefore attempts at a good\r\nalliance between non-Communists and Communists were shams, mistakes, or\r\nfrauds. This is easy to say in the 1950s; it was not so apparent in the\r\n1940s.\r\n\r\nIt can even be argued that Yalta, and everything for which Yalta stands,\r\nwas a tragic mistake and yet a blessed one. If the Western powers had\r\nnot attempted to deal amicably with the Soviet Union at Yalta the\r\nWestern peoples, already hypersensitized in matters of conscience, might\r\nhave attributed to themselves and to their posterity an unbearable\r\nburden of guilt. We and our children might have gone down fighting while\r\nwondering in our innermost hearts, \"Why didn't we make a _real_ try to\r\navoid war with Soviet Russia?\"\r\n\r\nThough the Teheran and Yalta agreements have been violated by the USSR\r\nalmost from the moment they were concluded, it can be argued that the\r\nWestern world was wise in experimenting with appeasement because it\r\nliberated our consciences for future struggle. No one can possibly argue\r\nthat we did not try to get along with the Communist system, that we\r\nfailed to offer the Communists a reasonable share in the world of power\r\npolitics, or that we threatened the Communists with aggression during\r\nthe course of our anti-fascist struggle. For better or for worse, we\r\n_did_ try to get along with them. We have failed.\r\n\r\nWhy have we failed?\r\n\r\nThe failure seems to be much more on the side of the Communists than on\r\nthe side of the free nations. Though it is possible for Left-liberals or\r\nhypercritical intellectuals to find fault with the U.S. and British\r\nposition in this respect or that, short of extreme nit-picking it must\r\nbe argued that the Communists jumped the gun on the Western powers in\r\nalmost every case. Tito, while still in agreement with Moscow, proved\r\nimplacable toward the constitutional Yugoslav government and the Church\r\nas they had existed before 1941. While Roosevelt was still living the\r\nLublin Poles prepared a savage double-cross of the London Poles. Whether\r\nCommunist action arose from a lamentable fear of our own aggressiveness,\r\nor a Machiavellian plan to conquer the world does not, at any time,\r\nmatter very much; what matters is the almost indisputable fact that in\r\nmany parts of the world the Communists undertook the initiative against\r\nthe anti-Communists.\r\n\r\n(The first edition of this book, PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE, was written in\r\n1946 and published in 1948; the second edition is being completed eight\r\nyears later, in 1954. Any reader who contrasts the two editions will see\r\nat a glance that the author, although suspicious of Communism, had no\r\nreal anticipation of the fury or seriousness of the Communist attack\r\nupon the non-Communist world, nor of the strategic arguments and\r\nresponsibilities which the free world would therewith be forced to\r\naccept.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Cold War and the Actual Fighting.= As late as 1948, when the\r\ntalented and bold-minded Lt. Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer was Deputy Chief\r\nof Staff, the U.S. Army's psychological warfare facilities at the\r\nGeneral Staff level consisted of a few paper assignments to colonels in\r\noperations and in training together with your author as a part-time\r\nconsultant and one girl stenographer to keep the files. By 1953 these\r\nnumbers were multiplied by the hundreds. Each of the military services\r\nhas accepted its responsibility so that by 1953 there was not merely one\r\nArmy PsyWar system, but there were at least five separate organizations\r\nin the U.S. Government in different places and at five levels directly\r\nconcerned with these problems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 71: Official Chinese Letter._ This surrender pass\r\nfrom Korea shows intelligent American use of materials from another\r\nculture--The ancient format, in this case, of the traditional Chinese\r\nbureaucratic letter.]\r\n\r\nA curious division of responsibilities not anticipated by the Creel\r\nCommittee of World War I or the OWI of World War II arose in the\r\nWashington of the Cold War period. While the military establishments\r\nwere given jurisdiction over propaganda activities connected with actual\r\ncombat, other propaganda activities were kept largely in civilian hands,\r\nthough simultaneously the direction of civilian policy at its very\r\nhighest level became para-military through the influence of the National\r\nSecurity Council.\r\n\r\nIn other words, most of the national foreign-policy decisions at the\r\nhighest level have been dictated in recent years by strategic\r\nconsiderations. They have been National Security Council decisions, not\r\nCabinet-type decisions of the kind which might have been made in the\r\nyears of William McKinley or Warren G. Harding. Yet, even though the\r\ndecisions have been strategic in type, the propaganda implementation of\r\nthese decisions has fallen for the greater part on the State Department\r\nand on the economic aid program facilities, not on the military. The\r\nmilitary have been pretty strictly confined to those aspects of\r\npropaganda which directly pertain to combat areas. By 1953 U.S. leaders\r\nhad begun to understand the situation with which they had been dealing\r\nsince 1947 and in light of that necessarily belated but correct\r\nappreciation of their own position, the William Jackson Committee began\r\nto recommend that propaganda policy be written not as something\r\nself-contained, but be considered an integral part of every other U.S.\r\nGovernment decision possessing world situation or news impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Cold War and the Home Front.= Among editors, professors, officers,\r\nofficials, and other experts concerned with foreign affairs, there has\r\nbeen frequent lamentation that the American people did not take the\r\ngreat struggle of our time more seriously. The contrary should be\r\nargued, at least by way of contrast.\r\n\r\nIf it is true that the United States is engaged in a major struggle, if\r\nit is further true that this struggle has no visible end, if this\r\nstruggle threatens all of us and our children as well with lifetimes of\r\ntension and violent deaths under ultra-destructive weapons, one may\r\nquite reasonably ask the question, _Which is the better reaction for the\r\nbulk of the American population: normality, emotional health, mild\r\nirresponsibility, and the stockpiling of nervous and physical strength\r\nfor a time of trial which may lie far ahead; or, alternatively, tension\r\nnow, worry now, responsibility now, fatigue now, all the way through\r\nfrom the uncertain present across the bitter and perilous future to the\r\nmonths of near-Armageddon which may lie fifteen, twenty, or thirty years\r\nahead?_\r\n\r\nSadly and seriously, with no attempt at cleverness or mockery, a staff\r\nofficer could argue today that the American people should leave their\r\nworries to their leaders so as to be strong when the time of trouble\r\ncomes. In the field of civil defense, for instance, it is grotesque to\r\nspend billions on offense and little on the saving of American lives. On\r\nsecond glance, this may not be so grotesque after all. The technological\r\nadvance of fissionable and thermonuclear weapons is so rapid, the\r\ndevelopment of guided missiles and other carrying instruments so swift\r\nand so unpredictable, that a 1955 model civil-defense system might\r\nbecome a fool's paradise by 1960. If this be true, it is better to live\r\nas well as we can to maintain the profession of arms at an adequate\r\nlevel, to hope (quite irrationally) for the best, and to let the dead of\r\nthe future bury their dead as best they may.[47]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Alternatives to Victory and Defeat.= In a cold war, as opposed to a\r\nwar, the role of the armed services is to deter the enemy, not fight\r\nthe enemy, and the purpose of the government is to achieve an\r\naccommodation (in the sense of an arrangement satisfactory to both\r\nsides), not a victory. If this is correct, serious reappraisal must be\r\nmade of the U.S. PsyWar position as well as of our strategic thinking.\r\n\r\nThe alternatives to victory and defeat are forms of survival of the\r\ncompetitors. The entire health of each competing civilization matters.\r\nIt is obvious enough to Americans that we must remain prosperous, free,\r\nconstitutional, democratic. It goes without saying that we must, as far\r\nas our individual fortunes permit us, retain our belief in God and\r\nderive from religious beliefs those spiritual strengths not available to\r\nthe Communists. What is not often raised is the equally important factor\r\nof _the conquest of probability_.\r\n\r\nWars are much more often won by people who are sure they are going to\r\nwin than by people who know that they would _like_ to win, but who think\r\nat the same time that they _will_ probably be defeated. The\r\nover-confidence of a Cortez or a Mao Tse-tung may seem insane to many of\r\nus. With the passion for security so prevalent in individual and\r\nnational lives, both the Western powers and the individuals comprising\r\nthem grotesquely exaggerate the margin of safety which they need in\r\nwhich to survive.\r\n\r\nPart of this springs from the fact that much of our civilization is not\r\nforward-looking, that neither young Americans nor old Americans have a\r\nclear-cut or hopeful picture of what the world should be, will be, and\r\nmust be, by A.D. 2055. On the Communist side it is frequent, but not\r\nuniversal, to discover that the best Communist cadres are made up of men\r\nwho are dead sure that Communism will win, who are equally sure that\r\nCommunism does not have to be right in order to win, and who are sure\r\nthat \"objectively and scientifically\" (whatever that may mean), the\r\nCommunist system is almost certainly destined to succeed. If Communism\r\ncannot get out of succeeding, the responsibility of the individual\r\nCommunist becomes bearable; he is still seriously and tragically\r\nresponsible for the expediting or the delaying of the inevitable, but he\r\ndoes not take the mantle of God or Karl Marx and state that this is the\r\nworld as he wishes it to be and that the world of his desires will come\r\ninto existence if, and only if, he fulfills his personal\r\nresponsibilities to the utmost.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, perhaps more than in Europe, there are many persons who are\r\nturning toward Communism, not because they think it is good or just, or\r\neven because it is powerful, but simply because it is _likely_. Every\r\nindividual in his own life has known that he cannot undo the passage of\r\ntime, the aging of his body, the death of his loved ones, the loss of\r\nopportunities which might have been seized, or even his own death; in\r\ntheir individual lives men of all nations perform the feat,\r\ncharacteristic of the human being and apparently shared by no other\r\nspecies of life, of living from day to day in a constant reconciliation\r\nof the past and present with their own estimate of the probable future.\r\nAt times in history, _that which should happen_ seems to be unleashed\r\nlike spiritual lightning and men rally in frenzy around causes which for\r\nthe year or the decade seem inspiring, terrifyingly beautiful, and\r\nwithin human reach; through most of history, _that which is apt to\r\noccur_ provides a more sober guide to the future and men prepare to live\r\nin accordance with its standards.\r\n\r\nIn the battle of the probabilities the PsyWar of the Western powers has\r\nbeen weak, high-pitched, and uncertain, while the insistence of the\r\nCommunist themes has been as monotonous and hypnotic as a jungle drum.\r\nFor better or for worse, the Communists have broken a path through to\r\nwhat they think to be the future; we of other nations have not.\r\n\r\nThe chief element of anti-Communist victory--practical, sober\r\nexpectation of a certain and final downfall of the Soviet system--has\r\nthus far been lacking on the anti-Communist side.\r\n\r\nThe Communists, on the contrary, have unreasonably, provocatively, and\r\nuntruthfully raved, screamed, shrieked, and lied to bring about that\r\nbetter world which, curiously enough, their most effective cadres\r\nconsidered to be an inevitable world. Thus the UN prisoners held by the\r\nCommunists during the Korean war were subjected to a constant\r\nbombardment of Communist propaganda concerning their personal\r\nresponsibilities before history and the opportunities which they would\r\nhave to serve peace and mankind, as these noble concepts are set forth\r\non the Red side.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The End of the Cold War.= If the hypothesis set forth above (page 251,\r\nnote 3), namely, that the Cold War may turn out to be unendable war\r\nexcept in terms which no living man can visualize, it may be true that\r\nappreciation of the role of psychological warfare (whatever it may later\r\nbe called) in this struggle may have to wait a few more years. One\r\nfactor often overlooked on the American side has been the _limitation of\r\nthe originators_. Propaganda, to be effective among foreign peoples or\r\nforeign armies, cannot and should not outrun the strategic capabilities\r\nor the political intentions of the issuing power.\r\n\r\nIt does no good for an American propaganda radio to pledge battle to the\r\ndeath while the U.S. press services amiably discuss an accommodation\r\nwith the Communists. Comparably, an official propaganda plan to make\r\nthe people of France feel that the Americans love and admire them is not\r\nvery realistic if, in terms of column-inches of French press material,\r\nunofficial American utterances are related to France to the effect that\r\nthe French are washed up, their cause in Indochina hopeless, their\r\neconomy unviable, and their political goals foolish. The years 1950-54,\r\nduring which the Korea struggle took place and in which NATO and the\r\nEuropean Defense Community (EDC) came to prominence, often showed a\r\nproclivity on the part of U.S. official propagandists to go far beyond\r\nthat which their home public would support. Need it be said that the\r\neffects on foreign public opinion were possibly deflationary?\r\n\r\nAn imaginable end to the Cold War may lie in neither victory nor defeat,\r\nin neither accommodation nor reconciliation, but in the development of\r\nmore, newer, and different quarrels. Hostility of Protestant and\r\nCatholic faded out in Europe when the hostility of French, Germans,\r\nSpaniards, and other nationalities came to be more important. It is a\r\nproblem for the psychiatrist and sociologist to answer if they can. Is\r\nit possible that semantics of war-causing quarrels can be superseded by\r\nanything other than _different_ quarrels? A tension-free civilization is\r\nimaginable; given the characteristics of most present-day cultures it is\r\nscarcely more than merely _imaginable_.[48]\r\n\r\nIf within the limits of practical possibility one were to list the\r\nhypothetical requirements for an end of the Cold War, the following\r\nmight stand forth:\r\n\r\n(1) General war leading to destruction of either the Communist or\r\nnon-Communist systems; _or_\r\n\r\n(2) Prolongation of the present Cold War atmosphere until new and more\r\ninteresting quarrels arise which make the present ones obsolete; _or_\r\n\r\n(3) Reconciliation of the Communist and anti-Communist systems, by some\r\nprocess not now imaginable, along the general lines of Franklin D.\r\nRoosevelt's \"Grand Design;\" _or_\r\n\r\n(4) Collapse of all major civilizations under impact of fissionable and\r\nthermonuclear weapons; _or_\r\n\r\n(5) Gradual erosion of the anti-Communist world and an eventual\r\nCommunist victory by sustained Communist successes short of war--or the\r\nalternative of gradual erosion of the Communist world and the creation\r\nof a constitutionalist and libertarian probability of victory, also\r\nwithout the outbreak of general war.\r\n\r\nIt would be a brave and foolish man who would say which of these the\r\nworld should expect, but it would be a stupid staff officer who did not\r\nanticipate at least one of them and who did not as a military officer or\r\ngovernment official do his best to bring about \"victory\" in a form which\r\nhis side could define, recognize, welcome, and achieve.[49]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Seven Small Wars.= The foregoing extensive discussion of the Cold\r\nWar has been included because it explains a great deal of the apparent\r\ncontradictoriness, irresoluteness, and uncertainty of the small wars\r\nwhich have occurred since the end of World War II. The seven small wars\r\nfall into a threefold pattern, if China is excluded (China is taken up\r\nin the next section). This is the first pattern; five of the seven wars\r\nwere Asian struggles against the Western powers: Korea, Indochina, the\r\nPhilippines (in which Communist Filipinos regard the United States as\r\ntheir ultimate enemy), Malaya, and Indonesia. In Korea and Indochina the\r\nstruggle came to be Communist-controlled. In Indonesia the struggle\r\nended in a nationalist victory. In the Philippines the struggle\r\ndegenerated into petty skirmishes between a native constitutional\r\ngovernment and Communist extremists. One war was an expression of\r\nEuropean nationalism on the soil of Asia, with the creation of the new\r\nstate of Israel. The third category is, of course, the special case\r\npresented by the Indian-Pakistani fighting which is a struggle between\r\nAsian nationalisms without much intervention from either European\r\ncolonialism or Communism.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these wars were the five in Korea, Indochina, the\r\nPhilippines, Malaya, and Indonesia. The Israeli struggle appears pretty\r\nwell settled as a fighting war and the India-Pakistan issue appears not\r\nto be one which will lead to general war between those two countries.\r\nThe predominant group of wars shows variations of the same components in\r\ndifferent quantities.\r\n\r\nEach was a reaction to the fall of Japan's short-lived East Asia\r\nmilitary empire. Each involved partial or complete resistance to\r\neconomic affiliation with the capitalist world. Each had an ingredient,\r\nthough these differed in stress and direction, of local Asian\r\nnationalism. Except for Indonesia, each eventually became a part of the\r\nworld-wide front between Communism and anti-Communism. These wars\r\ndeserve consideration one at a time for their PsyWar content.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 72: Intimidation Pattern._ A Korean-language\r\nleaflet maximizes the threat to enemy ground personnel of U. S. air\r\noperations. The enemy dug in.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Special Case of China.= None of the wars mentioned above was as\r\nbloody or as tragic as the Chinese civil war between Communists and\r\nNationalists which ended with a Red victory in 1949. The China situation\r\nis too complicated to be summed up in a single paragraph. The political,\r\neconomic, and propaganda components on each side of that war are as yet\r\nnot completely assessed.\r\n\r\nFor instance, one of the major factors in the defeat of the Nationalists\r\nconsisted of the withdrawal of the Japanese managers and technicians\r\nfrom China as well as of those Japanese troops who had been maintaining\r\na degree of law and order in Manchuria and North China. This withdrawal\r\nwas not only sought by such \"progressives\" in the State Department as\r\nJohn Stewart Service and Alger Hiss; it was also enthusiastically\r\nendorsed by conservatives such as General Wedemeyer, who shipped the\r\nJapanese out and General MacArthur, who received them. No American,\r\nright-wing or left-wing, seriously proposed replacing the Japanese with\r\nUnited States or United Nations personnel until the Nationalists had\r\nenough trainees to manage a modern, capitalist China. By withdrawing the\r\nJapanese the Nationalists and the Allies destroyed the political and\r\neconomic system under which the Nationalists proposed to operate and\r\nwere then astonished when the Nationalists met defeat.\r\n\r\nIn the China policy situation the contribution of Communist covert\r\npropaganda within the United States in preventing aid to Chiang in the\r\ncrucial years of 1947, 1948 and 1949 should not be overlooked; neither\r\nshould it be overestimated nor considered the sole determinant of events\r\nwhich took place within China.[50]\r\n\r\n\r\n=PsyWar in the Indonesian-Dutch War.= A rapid and talented command of\r\npropaganda was shown by the Indonesians in their retention of power in\r\nthe face of a Dutch landing in the islands in 1945-46. The Indonesians\r\nwere readily alert to the necessity for obtaining U.S., British,\r\nAustralian, and other foreign sympathizers. They opened propaganda\r\noffices abroad and did an excellent job of presenting their own case.\r\nWhile Indonesian combat propaganda against the Netherlands troops is not\r\nrecorded as having had much effect on Dutch morale, their use of global\r\nstrategic propaganda to support a local war was excellent. Netherlands\r\nships were refused docking and loading services by Australian\r\nstevedores. American press and public sympathy ran very largely in the\r\nIndonesian favor. Indonesian acceptance of the political concept,\r\n\"United States of Indonesia,\" which was dropped as soon as independence\r\nwas won, may have played a significant role in winning American\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 73: Communist Wall Propaganda._ Wall messages\r\nhave been ubiquitous in China for many years, leading one wit to accuse\r\nthe Chinese of \"mural turpitude.\" Here the ancient Chinese device has\r\nbeen turned against English-reading personnel.]\r\n\r\nDutch military and strategic propaganda in their war with the\r\nIndonesians suffered from uncertainty on the Dutch side as to the goals\r\nof the war, the suspicion that a Netherlands victory would be nothing\r\nmore than a triumph of colonial capitalism, and the insistent\r\ninterference of United Nations and United States observers. The Dutch\r\nwere never able to put across the point that Indonesia derived its\r\nnationhood from Imperial Japanese sponsorship and the Netherlands\r\nwithdrawal was dictated as much by the practical necessity of\r\nreconciling world opinion and balancing the home budget as by the\r\nmilitarily untenable nature of the Dutch enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Philippine War Against the Huks.= By contrast, the Republic of the\r\nPhilippines faced a very serious military situation in the challenge of\r\nthe Huk armies--tough Communist troops concentrated in central\r\nLuzon--who waged a cruel and bitter war, rather like the struggle of the\r\nIrish Republicans against the Black-and-Tans. By 1950 the Philippine\r\nGovernment was in a serious position. There was at least the remote\r\npossibility that if the Government continued to falter, the city of\r\nManila might have fallen to a Communist _coup_.\r\n\r\nIn this situation Ramón Magsaysay, as Secretary of Defense, developed\r\nsome of the most provocative and audacious anti-guerrilla operations of\r\nthe postwar period. To meet the Communist claim that the struggle was\r\none of the landless against the rich, he offered all surrendered Huks\r\nresettlement in a new land project; he visited the project himself\r\nfrequently enough to make sure it remained a valuable demonstration\r\narea. To allow the common people to help the Government, without their\r\nsuffering from Communist reprisals against themselves or their\r\nfamilies, he disseminated secret methods whereby the people could\r\ncommunicate with the Government forces. He established a psychological\r\nwarfare office under Major José Crisol. This office was doing as good a\r\njob of tactical PsyWar with leaflets, mimeographs, loudspeakers, light\r\nplanes, and other field and headquarters equipment as any army\r\ninstallation which the author has seen. Most of the doctrine and\r\nprocedures for the operation of the office were American, but the\r\ncontent of the materials was Filipino. Catholicism, Filipino patriotism,\r\nMalayan nativism and peasant common sense were some of the factors used\r\nto underscore the Philippine Army's appeals. In the following three\r\nyears the Huks shrank seriously although the danger could not be said to\r\nhave been eliminated altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Indochina and Political Warfare.= With devotion, often with heroism,\r\nfrequently with brilliance, the French military forces in Indochina\r\nfought a Communist-captured nationalist movement known as the Viet Minh;\r\nthey fought despite the accompaniments of a wretched and vacillating\r\nhome policy, incredibly poor psychological relationships with the native\r\nélite, and security situations which pass all American belief. (One\r\nVietnamese recently told the author that the pro-Communist Viet Minh\r\nsoldiers fought as long as they could against the French and then came\r\nback to French territory to eat good food, visit their families, rest\r\nand relax before returning to the field to murder more French sentries,\r\nblow up more French patrols, or attack more French outposts.)\r\n\r\nIt ill becomes an American to criticize the French for their policy in\r\nIndochina since it was by virtue of a U.S. strategic decision and a U.S.\r\nlogistical action that Indochina was turned first from Japanese hands\r\ninto the hands of the British in the south and the Chinese Nationalists\r\nin the north. The British did not care much about the local situation.\r\nThe particular Chinese Nationalists in northern Indochina were mildly\r\nsympathetic with local nationalism, but chiefly preoccupied with\r\nstealing everything that could be put on a truck. After this ill-fated\r\nliberation the Americans then assisted the French in transporting forces\r\nback to Indochina. This was after much of the U.S. press and many U.S.\r\nleaders had indicated their disapproval of French colonialism and had\r\ngiven indirect but powerful encouragement to Viet Minh's rebellion\r\nagainst the French. Having helped foul up the situation for the French\r\nhopelessly, the United States then observed their return (a return which\r\nwas definitely, though indirectly, made possible only by U.S. aid to\r\nFrance) with uncertainty and disquiet. It took the Americans four years\r\nto decide that they were on the French side and even then they were not\r\nvery much on the French side.\r\n\r\nNeither were the French.\r\n\r\nThe \"French side\" was an indefinable amalgam of old-fashioned French\r\ncolonialism, the membership of three small Asian states in a French\r\nUnion, and anti-Communism. The French made the mistake which the\r\nAmericans repeated when they invited the Chinese Communist general, Wang\r\nHsiu-ch'üan, to New York to defame the United States through the\r\ncourtesy of the United States Government, or when they tried dealing\r\nwith the Chinese Communists, fighting them, dealing with them, and\r\nfighting with them again. When the French finally decided to seek an\r\nall-out military victory against the Communists they set up local\r\ngovernments which they themselves promptly dishonored, giving them\r\nneither prestige nor authority enough to combat the Communist menace in\r\nlocal Asian terms.\r\n\r\nThat the French should have held the Asian anti-Communist front under\r\nthese strange political circumstances is a credit to France. The\r\nIndochinese war has been dirty, discouraging. It has often verged upon\r\nthe hopeless. The French have been criticized by the Americans in the\r\nearly period of the reoccupation of Indochina for not turning the\r\ncountry over to Communist \"nationalists\" lock, stock and barrel; later\r\nthe Americans criticized the French because the French did not\r\nannihilate the same \"Communist nationalists\" whom the Americans had\r\npreviously lauded. In the end, Dien Bien Phu and Geneva were the\r\ninevitable concomitants of Panmunjom. Once we made \"peace,\" the French\r\nhad to make an equally bad \"peace\" too.\r\n\r\nThe United States was adroit enough to obtain the immense psychological\r\nleverage of getting the Korean war recognized as a UN war. The\r\nIndochinese war was not made a UN war even though it was the same enemy\r\nwho was being fought--Asian Communists underwritten by Peking and\r\nguaranteed by Moscow--in each case.\r\n\r\nAmazing though it may seem, practical psychological warfare was almost\r\ncompletely neglected by the French until the Americans supplied the\r\nFrench with printing facilities for French Annamite leaflets in 1950. By\r\n1952 the French had assigned staff officers to carry out psychological\r\nwarfare responsibilities and were making a serious effort to link up\r\nwith the other anti-Communist forces in East Asia for the purpose of\r\nobtaining psychological warfare know-how. A considerable improvement in\r\ntactical psychological warfare was made between 1950 and 1952. The\r\nstrategic psychological warfare position of the French in the area must\r\nbe referred back to the \"battle of the probabilities,\" mentioned earlier\r\nin this chapter. So long as French, Americans, and Annamites all feel\r\nthat a French defeat is quite probable and say so both publicly and\r\nprivately, it will be difficult for the French to make the Indochinese\r\nbelieve that Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Laos are here to stay as\r\nFrench-protected and anti-Communist nations.[51]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Malaya and the MRLA.= The MRLA, or Malayan Races Liberation Army, is a\r\nChinese Communist guerrilla army operating in the jungles of Malaya.\r\nMalaya (minus the island of Singapore, which is a separate Crown Colony\r\nto itself) has been constituted in the postwar period as a federation of\r\nMalay sultanates. The British have talked a great deal about the\r\nself-government of Malaya, the eventual end of their own rule, and the\r\nprogress of the people. Everything, or almost everything, which the\r\nBritish say is true--except for the fundamental fact that the Chinese in\r\nMalaya can, under British rule, enjoy anything except life, purpose, and\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nWhat are \"life, purpose, and honor\" in basic human terms?\r\n\r\nThey are the rights to belong to something, to be a part of history, to\r\nmake one's own world move, to be a human being superior to other human\r\nbeings, to be vain, to be proud, to be self-sacrificing.\r\n\r\nAfter years of war against the Chinese Communist guerrillas who have\r\nsmall components of Malayans and Indians with them, the British have not\r\nyet found a single British brigadier or major general of the Chinese\r\nrace. The world at large on the anti-Communist side has yet to hear of a\r\nChinese-Malayan hero who served mankind by falling martyr to the\r\nCommunist terror or by emerging as victor in valiant heroic combat.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese in Malaya, as the author has observed at first hand, are\r\nprobably more prosperous than any other Chinese have ever been anywhere\r\nin the world. Under capitalism today the Chinese communities in Malaya\r\nhave achieved a degree of wealth, health, and education which Communist\r\nChina will be remarkable to have achieved if it survives and succeeds\r\nfor the next hundred years.\r\n\r\nDoes this not give the lie to the great Communist myth concerning\r\nAsia--the myth accepted by many Western politicians, intellectuals, and\r\nnewspaper men--that the struggle between Communism and anti-Communism is\r\na struggle for living standards? that the issue is an issue of \"who will\r\nprovide the best livelihood\"?\r\n\r\nOn the pro-Communist side in Malaya, Chinese who are not religious and\r\nwho are known for their practicality and secularism, struggle for the\r\nchance to go forth and suffer, to serve in an army with bad medical\r\nservice and no pensions, to face an almost certain death in the jungle,\r\nto lose life and property (which they could keep on the British side) in\r\norder to gain that other kind of life--life with honor and purpose, on\r\nthe Communist side.\r\n\r\nThe British meanwhile progress, no doubt. In many respects the British\r\nadministrations in Singapore and Malaya are more enlightened than some\r\nof the local governments in the United States. But whatever the reason,\r\nthey do not seem to belong to the Chinese who live there or even to the\r\nMalays. They are governments for the people, and not (so far as the\r\nlocal people seem to judge) governments _of_ the people.\r\n\r\nIs it reasonable to ask in the mid-1950s that decent British officers\r\nand civil servants convert themselves into apocalyptic fanatics of a\r\nweird composite Asian nationalism? Can the British make revolution in\r\nMalaya when they are rather fatigued with their own Labor revolution at\r\nhome? Can we Americans, who have made nothing, absolutely nothing, out\r\nof the heroism and romance and tradition that might have been\r\nreconstituted as the ancient kingdom of Ryukyu (Okinawa), be in a\r\nposition to chide the British for not doing that which we ourselves do\r\nnot undertake?\r\n\r\nThe Communist magic is strong, bad magic. In North Korea it created\r\nofficers in an unreasonably short time, developed fanatics while we were\r\ntrying to develop gentlemen, and came close to defeating us in the\r\nperilous weeks of the Pusan perimeter. In China soldiers of whom many\r\nAmericans despaired when they fought on the Nationalist side became\r\ndesperate assault infantry under Communist training. The timid and\r\nquarrelsome Annamites who had given the French so little trouble before\r\nCommunism organized them, fought like leopards once they read Marx,\r\nLenin, Mao Tse-tung and Ho Chi-minh.\r\n\r\nWas this why the Communists were able to continue in Malaya? No one has\r\never accused the British Army of a lack of ingenuity. The forces who\r\ndeveloped desert raiders, coastal commandos, air-dropped _banditti_, and\r\na plethora of amusing, shocking, and audacious innovations cannot be\r\naccused of a lack of imagination.\r\n\r\nThe British _did_ use psychological warfare in Malaya strategically,\r\ntactically, in the field, in the cities, by radio, and by print. When\r\nCarleton Greene was directing the British PsyWar effort from the\r\nheadquarters of that redoubtable gentleman, Malcolm MacDonald, British\r\nCommissioner General for South East Asia, he even resorted to the device\r\nof writing individual letters to known Communists and leaving these\r\nletters scattered through the jungle. The British used white propaganda,\r\nblack propaganda, grey propaganda; if there had been a purple propaganda\r\nthey certainly would have tried it. Alex Josey came close to it when he\r\nshocked the planters in Malaya by delivering socialist speeches over the\r\nMalay radio in an attempt to pull the Left wing off the Communist bird.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Gurney, the High Commissioner of the Federation who was\r\nmurdered in 1952, was a veteran of irregular warfare. He had faced the\r\nZionist terrorists in Jerusalem and was a man without fear. His approach\r\nto the problem of confronting Communism was _hopelessly sane_. The\r\nCommunists were offering young Chinese the intoxication of craziness, of\r\na mad and heroic righteousness to justify the misspending of their\r\nlives. Sir Henry's answer was decency, goodness, security, prosperity,\r\nauthority, liberty under law. He offered everything except glamor,\r\nterror, inspiration, and romance--\r\n\r\nEverything except the chance to join the British side.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of British side?\r\n\r\nA British side which, like the Communist side, would welcome the makers\r\nof the future, the builders of the next civilization, the arbiters of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe Communists have presented a high bid against the U.S. and Britain as\r\nwell as the other Western powers. We have not yet overbid them. The high\r\nbid is the opportunity to join, to belong, really to be equal, not just\r\nlegally equal, and, above everything, to share, to struggle, and to work\r\nunder conditions of heroism for a common goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Right to Join.= The West has lost a lot of the Cold War in Asia\r\nbecause the Communist side could be joined and the Western side could\r\nnot be joined. There is no American party in India, but there is a\r\nCommunist party. There is no anti-Communist army to which cadres of men\r\nfrom either Soviet-occupied or Soviet-free territories can be made\r\nwelcome. There is no command point for the anti-Communist struggle.\r\nThere is the promise of immense U.S. help, even the promise of British,\r\nColombian, Ethiopian, and other help, for Korea or other Koreas. Is\r\nthere much willingness _to be helped_? Is there any way that we can let\r\nordinary Asians in on our side?\r\n\r\nThe top levels of this problem are, of course, political. They must be\r\nsolved in the light of a U.S. home public which eschews crusades and\r\ndreads adventures. At a lower level the problem becomes one for the\r\nmilitary staffs of the future. How can the United States, the United\r\nNations, or other anti-Communist forces recruit native leaders and\r\nnative followers under circumstances of dignity and honor? How can we\r\neither learn to love the allies we have or to find allies whom we can\r\nlove? Until then much of the spiritual and organizational advantage in\r\nAsia will fall to the Communists. We may have the better ideals, but if\r\npeople who are determined to illuminate their own lives with the\r\nsplendor of risky, heroic, or self-sacrificing action (and who insist on\r\ndoing something desperate somewhere somehow, so as to relieve the\r\nignominy, poverty, and monotony of their existences) cannot learn how to\r\njoin us, they will perforce join the other side.\r\n\r\nA slight or even a substantial increase in economic welfare in the Asian\r\nstates seems to the author to favor a sharp increase in Communist\r\nstrength. When people are desperately poor or sick they cannot worry\r\nabout causes. When they become moderately well off--well enough off to\r\nknow that they are despised, poor by our standards, ignorant by our\r\nstandards--then the point of psychological frenzy comes in.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Propaganda Techniques in the Seven Wars.= Neither in the Chinese civil\r\nwar nor in the seven other wars listed has there been much refinement of\r\npropaganda techniques over World War II. As a matter of fact, it took\r\nthe Korean war two years to come up to the standards of Normandy. It is\r\namazing how many propaganda techniques had become lost arts between 1945\r\nand 1950. The author himself flew _under_ the Chinese Communist forces\r\nalong the Han River in March 1951 when the voice plane in which he rode\r\nas an observer had to hug the valley bottoms in order to get its message\r\nto the Chinese ground forces past the sound of its own propellers;\r\ninstead of ingenious, up-to-the-minute gadgets to dispense leaflets the\r\nauthor joined the young officers in the plane in throwing the leaflets\r\nout of the plane door by hand. He thought ruefully about the leaflet\r\nbombs and leaflet dispensers which had been used in Europe and in Burma,\r\nand when he returned unharmed to Taegu he submitted one more red-hot\r\nmemorandum recommending the obvious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 74: Divisive Propaganda, Korean Model._ In this\r\nleaflet an attempt is made to show the Asians-die-for-the-Kremlin\r\ntheme.]\r\n\r\nThe strategic PsyWar self-limitations imposed by the United States on\r\nthe United States in the Korean war were also crippling. The United\r\nStates did not desire anything which a professional soldier would\r\nrecognize as victory. U.S. opinion was divided as to whether all of\r\nKorea should be liberated by UN forces. At the policy-making\r\nlevel--certainly among our allies--there was pretty general agreement to\r\nremain at peace with the supply dumps and high command of the Chinese\r\nCommunist forces in Manchuria and China while fighting the forward\r\nechelons of those forces in Korea. The United States would not accept\r\ndefeat nor would it seek a decisive victory because victory might have\r\ninvolved the risk of war.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions it must be pointed out that General MacArthur had\r\nthe first and only PsyWar establishment ready to operate the moment the\r\nKorean war began. Col. J. Woodall Greene ably managed the Tokyo\r\nheadquarters for most of the period of the Korean war. The Department of\r\nthe Army showed great good judgment in bringing back Brig. Gen. Robert\r\nMcClure, who had been Eisenhower's PsyWar chief in Europe, to the new\r\nDepartment of the Army's PsyWar establishment which was created on 15\r\nJanuary 1951 in the Pentagon as a part of Special Staff, United States\r\nArmy, with the title of Office of the Chief of Psychological Warfare\r\n(OCPW). When General McClure departed for Teheran, he was succeeded at\r\nOCPW by Brig. Gen. William Bullock. The last period of the Korean war\r\nfound Korean local PsyWar at the headquarters of Eighth U.S. Army in\r\nKorea (EUSAK) under the command of Col. Donald Hall, who had probably\r\nseen more continuous PsyWar service than any other officer in the U.S.\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15\r\n\r\nStrategic International Information Operations\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1776 to 1945 the U.S. system of government managed to survive in a\r\nworld comprising many types of government without setting up its own\r\npropaganda and agitational forces. Propaganda through most of the\r\ntwentieth century was pretty clearly limited by the U.S. conception of\r\npropaganda as a weapon auxiliary to war. \"Psychological warfare\" became\r\nproper, in conventional American terms, only when there was a war to be\r\nwon. With the coming of peace in 1945 there was considerable uncertainty\r\nas to whether the United States should have a propaganda establishment\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nEven at the time of writing (1954) there is still some doubt as to\r\nwhether the United States needs propaganda facilities. The William\r\nJackson report of July 1953 indicated that the terms _propaganda_ and\r\n_psychological warfare_ were unsatisfactory. Of course they were. They\r\nstill are. The world itself is unsatisfactory--in terms of the\r\ntraditional, humane, rational U.S. point of view.\r\n\r\nThe story of U.S. \"peacetime\" propaganda since the end of World War II\r\nis a very complicated one. Quantity, direction, purpose, and quality\r\nhave shifted with the various turns of the international situation. The\r\nsubject has become much more difficult to write about since the time the\r\nfirst edition of this book was written in 1946.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, governmental secrecy has been very sharply restored.\r\nEven very routine State Department operations for putting across the\r\nU.S. point of view have been shrouded in masses of classified documents.\r\nFor reasons not always evident to the outside observer, the assumption\r\nhas become prevalent that the normal operations of the United States\r\nGovernment should be kept confidential, secret, or even top secret.\r\nOften it would seem that the attempt to maintain secrecy in\r\nnon-sensitive functions is not worth the security effort at all or,\r\ncontrariwise, may even reassure the antagonists of the United States by\r\nnot letting them realize how serious and how unfriendly our plans or\r\npolicies with respect to them may be. (This is not the time or place to\r\ndiscuss the problem of secrecy as a protection against domestic\r\ncriticism--which secrecy, of course, has often become, to the detriment\r\nof both the government and the citizens of the United States.)\r\n\r\nIn the second place, not only have information activities become more\r\nhush-hush: they have also become more complicated. It is difficult to do\r\njustice to an intricate moving panorama of activities, some of which may\r\nnot be mentioned or described under existing law.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Demobilization and Remobilization.= The ending of the OWI and the\r\ninstallation of the International Information Service, mentioned above\r\non page 184, in turn changed into the information activities of the\r\nDepartment of State. These were headed from 1945 to 1953 by an Assistant\r\nSecretary of State for Public Affairs. In 1953 a Director of the United\r\nStates Information Agency, _not_ under the Department of State but\r\nmysteriously attached to the National Security Council, was inaugurated.\r\nThe overseas operating component of USIA remained the United States\r\nInformation Service (USIS), transferred from State Department control.\r\n\r\nIn other words, there were eight years in which the Department of State\r\nhad primary responsibility for the conduct of peacetime propaganda of\r\nthe United States. This was the first and only time that the United\r\nStates Government had in a period of relative peace undertaken a\r\nsustained propaganda effort.\r\n\r\nThe effort had ups and downs because neither the citizenry nor the\r\nofficials knew whether the country was in a condition of peace or at war\r\nand, if at war, at war with _whom_. To some the enemy was Communism, the\r\nideology; to others, Communism the movement; to still others, the USSR;\r\nto others, the Korean Communists, but not the Chinese Communists; to\r\nothers, the Chinese Communists in Korea, but not the Chinese Communists\r\nin China; and so on, _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\nThe general history of these eight years was, by and large, a first\r\nphase in which the United States demobilized or destroyed propaganda\r\nfacilities which had been built up with great skill and at great cost\r\nduring World War II, and a second phase in which those facilities were\r\npartially rebuilt and the skills rediscovered. The low point in this\r\ndevelopment was probably the winter of 1947-48.\r\n\r\nFor a while, the rumor went around Washington that the Secretary of\r\nDefense, Louis Johnson, would not tolerate the utterance of the words\r\n_propaganda_ or _psychological warfare_, and that the Secretary of the\r\nArmy, Kenneth C. Royall, refused to have the topic mentioned to him.\r\nThat may be the exaggeration characteristic of newspapermen, but it\r\nepitomized the spirit of that time.\r\n\r\nWhile \"psychological warfare\" almost disappeared from the Department of\r\nDefense and the three services during this low point, the State\r\nDepartment never quite demobilized. For one thing, the State Department\r\nhad inherited the OWI facilities and the Army facilities in the occupied\r\ncountries--Austria, Germany, Korea, and Japan. As the heir to\r\nsubstantial informational facilities the State Department kept a\r\ncertain minimum activity going. Facilities such as American Broadcasting\r\nStation in Europe (ABSIE), Radio in the American Sector--of\r\nBerlin--(RIAS), the Information Control Commands in the American Sector\r\nof Germany, Information and Education (I&E) Section of the General\r\nHeadquarters of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) in\r\nJapan--these (though sometimes renamed) represented going propaganda\r\nconcerns which required a Washington command post.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it became standing operating procedure in the U.S. diplomatic\r\nestablishment to attach some kind of an informational facility to every\r\ndiplomatic establishment and to most of the major consulates.\r\n\r\nSince there were always advocates of complete propaganda dismantlement,\r\nas well as enthusiasts for the maintenance of information programs, the\r\nissue of remaining in the propaganda business or getting out was always\r\nmore or less in doubt. The economy and the demobilization phases of 1947\r\nand 1948 were stimulated by evidence of Soviet bad faith in Europe\r\nduring 1949 and brought into sharp focus by the outbreak of the Korean\r\nsemi-war in 1950.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to do justice to all these different systems in a\r\nsingle phrase. Even as late as the present, it is sometimes difficult to\r\ndetermine why the U.S. need have an information program operating in\r\nsuch entirely friendly countries as Cuba, Haiti, Ireland, or Australia.\r\nThere is some point to the argument set forth by ultraconservatives that\r\nwhat was good enough for Theodore Roosevelt ought to be good enough\r\ntoday; that, in other words, the United States should be known for what\r\nit is and not by what a few hired promoters can say about it.\r\n\r\nAs in so many other fields of activities, however, the past is\r\nirrecoverable. The United States can no more return to the pre-atomic\r\nage in propaganda matters than it can in defense matters. The world we\r\nhave built is with us and the only alternative to survival seems death.\r\nWith respect to the specific field of propaganda, this leads to\r\noccasional curious political alliances. Sometimes the conservatives in\r\nU.S. politics are so conservative they want no propaganda at all; at\r\nother times these same conservatives are so anti-Communist that they\r\nwant more propaganda. On occasions the Left within the USA has viewed\r\nU.S. propaganda with alarm and at other times has demanded that there be\r\nmore of it and that more of the content be Left.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs.= The Assistant\r\nSecretary of State for Public Affairs has been the principal officer of\r\ngovernment responsible for the conduct of U.S. propaganda during\r\n1945-53. His successor, the Director of the United States Information\r\nAgency, faces very closely related problems. Fortunately, one of these\r\nAssistant Secretaries of State has written an excellent book relating\r\nhis experiences and the problems of his office in detail. Edward W.\r\nBarrett in his _Truth is Our Weapon_ (New York, 1953), describes his own\r\nexperiences with two years in that position. The Assistant Secretary had\r\nthe help of an interdepartmental committee which, under various labels\r\nand with various degrees of secrecy, attempted to coordinate the foreign\r\ninformational activities of the various departments of the United States\r\nGovernment to common goals.\r\n\r\nLater, as will be described, the Assistant Secretary of State for Public\r\nAffairs was supplemented by a Psychological Strategy Board outside of\r\nthe Department of State and still later by a White House assistant in\r\ncharge of informational policies at the highest level.\r\n\r\nWhat can be said of this first U.S. peacetime performance in the\r\npropaganda field?\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Secretaries themselves have been men of varied capacities\r\nand interests. Mr. Barrett was an OWI veteran and a journalist of high\r\nstanding. George Allen was a tough-minded career diplomat. Howland\r\nSargeant was a distinguished government official. William Benton was the\r\nfounder of the most successful \"canned\" music system for restaurants and\r\nthe most vigorous promoter which the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ ever had;\r\nlater he became a Senator. Men such as these can scarcely be called\r\ntight-lipped fanatics emerging from the hidden recesses of a U.S.\r\n\"Politburo.\" They and their colleagues did a surprisingly good job.\r\n\r\nAmerican travelers overseas were often amazed to find that the U.S.\r\npropaganda effort was far more polished and purposeful than an observer\r\nwithin the United States could expect it to be. The activities of the\r\nAssistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs consisted of supervising\r\nthe domestic origination of broadcasts directed to the Soviet Union, the\r\nsatellite countries, neutrals, and friends. The radio system was\r\ngenerally known as the Voice of America. To this degree he had charge of\r\na propaganda system operated within the United States by Americans, but\r\nspeaking to foreigners, sometimes by transmitters located within the USA\r\nand more often with relay transmitters which picked up programs\r\noriginating in the continental United States and rebroadcast overseas.\r\n\r\nOne echelon removed, there were installations attached to the\r\ndiplomatic and consular establishments of the United States which were\r\nusually known as USIS although in some particular cases quasi-private\r\nfacilities were sponsored instead. In each foreign country there was at\r\nthe embassy or legation level a Public Affairs Officer (PAO) who was the\r\ninformation specialist for the diplomatic mission and--in theory at\r\nleast--in charge of all U.S. propaganda or informational activities,\r\nwhichever one preferred to call them, in the country to which he was\r\naccredited.\r\n\r\nA complex hierarchy of officials routed, relayed, screened, and\r\ncoordinated programs from headquarters to the PAOs in the field and\r\nproposals or requests from the PAOs back to headquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other U.S. Facilities.= A complicated element in the State Department's\r\nconduct of propaganda was the fact that at no time did the State\r\nDepartment enjoy even a monopoly of the _governmental_ mass\r\ncommunications of the United States abroad. (It goes without saying that\r\nat no time did the State Department achieve or seek control of private\r\nU.S. mass communications such as the international editions of _Time_\r\nand _Newsweek_, the circulation of American books and magazines on a\r\ncommercial basis, commercial American-owned publications abroad, or the\r\nlike.) At the very least level of competition the State Department had\r\nthe Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) broadcasting to most of the\r\ncountries in which the State Department was active--often broadcasting\r\nin quite a different tone of voice and with very different content. In\r\nmany instances, foreigners who understood English preferred to listen to\r\nthe lively radio programs transmitted for the edification of U.S.\r\nservice personnel stationed abroad, rather than to listen to \"canned\"\r\nprograms made up for the benefit of themselves as a foreign target. (The\r\nauthor has seen Chinese shopkeepers in Singapore listen very seriously\r\nto a sergeant giving the news of the day at dictation speed from an\r\narmed services transmitter somewhere in the Pacific Ocean area.) In 1948\r\nthere was virtually no coordination between the armed services and the\r\nDepartment of State. As time went on, the two sets of U.S. broadcasts\r\ntook a certain amount of note of each other. Coordination was not as\r\neasy as it might seem on paper.\r\n\r\nAfter all, what is one to do? Is it valid to \"propagandize\" our\r\ninnocently cherubic service personnel abroad whom so many domestic\r\npurity leagues and local pressure groups are anxious to defend? After\r\nall, these service people possess fearful weapons. Each has a\r\nCongressman to whom he might write. But if service personnel in a\r\nforeign country are to be given nonpropaganda materials, how can the\r\nsame area be given propaganda materials for the benefit of the\r\nindigenous personnel? The propaganda from the United States Government\r\nmust not be too much at variance with the \"nonpropaganda\" of the United\r\nStates Government. If the two extremes of communication were too far\r\napart, the United States Government might look like an ass. That would\r\nbe most unhappy.\r\n\r\nOver and above the contradictions and difficulties involved in the\r\noperation of at least two governmental systems and many private systems\r\nof U.S. news communication and dissemination systems in foreign areas,\r\nthere is the further problem of additional U.S. facilities. Sources such\r\nas _The Washington Post_, Joseph Alsop, James Reston, and other\r\nwell-informed Washington journalists often hinted gloomily and darkly\r\nthat U.S. cloak-and-dagger operations are still going on; Dorothy\r\nThompson was often troubled by what she regarded as the feckless\r\nsuccessors of the wartime OSS. Many times Americans resident in local\r\nareas concerned seemed never to have heard of the hush-hush operations\r\nin their own overseas homes, operations which were denounced with purple\r\nprose in Washington; we can say that covert operations, when they have\r\nbeen really uncovered, as in the case of the _Time_ story about\r\noverzealous U.S. support of a German nationalist resistance group, turn\r\nout to be much more pale than the lurid columnists or inside stories\r\nfrom Washington would lead one to believe.\r\n\r\nMore serious have been the duplication, and triplication, and occasional\r\nquadruplication of _official_ informational activities. The overseas\r\neconomic and military aid program, known successively as Economic\r\nCooperation Administration (ECA), Mutual Security Administration (MSA)\r\nand Foreign Operations Administration (FOA) has not only supplemented\r\nthe existing leaflet, broadcast, and other informational activities of\r\nthe State Department and the armed forces with a third set of\r\ninformation programs; it has itself had a fourth rival in the Point Four\r\nadministration, the Technical Cooperation Administration (TCA), which\r\nwas both a part of State and not a part of State, depending upon the\r\nparticular situation overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia.= Over and above the Government's\r\noperations in this field there have been the quasi-private undertakings\r\nof the Committee for a Free Europe and the Committee for a Free Asia.\r\nThese have been privately sponsored and privately financed by altruistic\r\norganizations dedicated to broadcasting those things which the State\r\nDepartment finds it impolitic to put on the air. The degree of\r\ngovernmental contribution or participation is not known, although it is\r\noften touched upon in the U.S. press; that the organizations are to a\r\ndefinite extent private is evident in their ability to broadcast local\r\nand controversial news to particular Iron Curtain countries and by the\r\nfund drives which they have waged with little contribution boxes inside\r\nthe USA.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the RFE and RFA type of operation is that by giving\r\nvoice to independent nongovernmental resistance to Communism it has\r\noften been possible to go far beyond the limits which intergovernmental\r\nprotocol would impose upon U.S. official broadcasts. That is, the United\r\nStates can scarcely describe a deputy minister in the Rumanian\r\nGovernment as a scoundrel, thief, pervert, or renegade; Rumanian exiles\r\nallowed access to Radio Free Europe stations need have no such\r\nlimitations. On the other hand, there is the difficulty that Radio Free\r\nEurope, because of its U.S.-based finance and management might lend an\r\nunnecessary U.S. sponsorship to genuinely independent anti-Communist\r\nundertakings. Here again, as in the case of the reconciliation of the\r\nState Department and Defense broadcasts, it is impossible to draw a\r\ndoctrinal rule which would prescribe on one hand that all propaganda\r\nbroadcasts should be unofficial or that they should all be official. One\r\ncannot even say that they should all be coordinated.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Psychological Strategy Board.= Coordination was nevertheless\r\nattempted--at least for the governmental side. In 1951 President Truman\r\ncreated the Psychological Strategy Board, bringing the versatile and\r\njudicious Gordon Gray back to Washington for the purpose. The prescribed\r\nrole of the Board was to coordinate, plan, and phase all United States\r\ninformation policies so as to achieve maximum effect from the\r\ngovernmental effort; not once did the Board dare reach out for a penny's\r\nworth of jurisdiction over private U.S. facilities. The Psychological\r\nStrategy Board was only originally under the chairmanship of the\r\nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency, then General Walter Bedell\r\nSmith, with the members of the Board consisting of the Under Secretary\r\nof State, the Under Secretary of Defense, and the Deputy Director of\r\nwhat was at the time known as ECA, later MSA. The Board had a series of\r\nable staff directors and small staffs detailed from other Government\r\ndepartments on a permanent basis to serve as a working secretariat. The\r\nprecise operations of the Board were cloaked in extraordinary secrecy.\r\nIt cannot be said that U.S. propaganda worsened in the two years\r\nfollowing the establishment of the Board; neither can it be said that\r\nU.S. PsyWar operations scored any coups so striking as to deserve a\r\nposition in the annals of international affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=William Jackson Report.= After the Republicans came into office in\r\n1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower moved to overhaul the information\r\nestablishment. He appointed a committee under the chairmanship of\r\nWilliam Jackson, a former OSS official and investment banker, and under\r\nthe secretaryship of Abbott Washburn, who had headed the superlatively\r\nsuccessful advertising department of General Mills, Inc., which had\r\nsuccessfully given away millions of prizes for millions of box tops from\r\ncereals consumed by American youth or flours relished by the American\r\nhousewife. Some of the liberal press commentators eyed the committee\r\ngloomily as it went to work. Nevertheless, that portion of its report\r\nwhich was made public turned out to be a document of remarkable finesse\r\nand sophistication.\r\n\r\nThe report, released in July 1953, pointed out the Psychological\r\nStrategy Board had erred in trying to plan informational activities in\r\nits own light instead of considering the _informational aspects_ of\r\nevery single U.S. Government activity possessing international\r\nsignificance. The report recommended the replacement of the\r\nPsychological Strategy Board by a more realistic policy-coordinating\r\norganization which would coordinate not merely propaganda policies, but\r\nall policies and, having coordinated all policies, would then resolve\r\nupon maximum psychological exploitation of the policies which had been\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\nIn a sense this is rather like saying that the United States should have\r\na President, since the powerful chief executive of this government has,\r\nsince 1789, been the final arbiter of executive matters, both foreign\r\nand domestic. In another sense it can be interpreted to mean that the\r\nresponsibilities of the Presidency are so great that no one man could\r\nperform in his head all the staff work necessary to see through the\r\nopinion-reactions which might develop abroad to U.S. executive decisions\r\nmade here at home. If the latter supposition is true, it means that the\r\nUnited States is saddled with one more intricate governmental process\r\nmade necessary by the closeness, dangerousness, and importance of\r\ninternational affairs in the lives of Americans and their government.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Operations Coordinating Board.= On 3 September 1953 President\r\nEisenhower, then at Denver, Colorado, issued an Executive Order\r\nabolishing the Psychological Strategy Board and creating the Operations\r\nCoordinating Board. According to informed press comment at the time, it\r\nwas the intention of the White House to carry out the recommendation to\r\nthis effect made by the President's Committee on International\r\nInformation Activities. The new Board was located immediately under the\r\nNational Security Council. C. D. Jackson was a significant member of the\r\nBoard, but not as chairman; the chairman was Walter Bedell Smith.\r\nBesides General Smith, then Under Secretary of State, the Board included\r\nHarold E. Stassen, Director of the Foreign Operations Administration;\r\nAllen W. Dulles, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency; and Roger\r\nM. Kyes, Deputy Secretary of Defense. The President also directed that\r\nTheodore C. Streibert, Director of the U.S. Information Service, make\r\nhimself available.\r\n\r\nIn so far as this development represented an attempt to coordinate the\r\nframing of U.S. Government policy in such a manner as to achieve maximum\r\nimpact on the rest of the world, it represented a major step forward.\r\nThe de-emphasis of \"psychological warfare\" or \"psychological strategy\"\r\nas operations which could somehow or other be efficacious _without_ a\r\ncontext of material support through the real-life behavior of the\r\nGovernment issuing the propaganda was a healthy sign indeed.\r\n\r\n_Psychological warfare_ is at best a cumbersome and pretentious label\r\nfor an important modern political and military weapon, the use of mass\r\ncommunication. The definition of empirical \"psychological warfare\" given\r\nin Chapter 3, and reproduced as it was originally written in 1946, makes\r\nit perfectly plain that the term acquires specificity which is made\r\nplain by the particular individualities involved undertaking the\r\noperation at any given time: psychological warfare is not an ancient\r\nterm which is so well defined by the usage of centuries that modern men\r\nwould be ill advised to redefine it or to sweep it aside.[52]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the basic weakness of the term _psychological warfare_ is its\r\npretentiousness within American civilization of the 1900s. No one now\r\nknows whether the United States of the 1960s will turn out to be\r\ndynamic, forward-looking, insistent upon its own view of the world. It\r\nis difficult in the 1950s to see how the next decade or so could bring\r\nforth anything as explosive or violent in the social and political field\r\nas the atomic bomb has been in the field of fission. The United States\r\ncertainly does not seem to be on the threshold of a new Islam. For\r\nbetter or for worse, the U.S. strengths are the strengths of sobriety,\r\ncalmness, health. They are the strengths of _living_ as opposed to the\r\nstrengths of _revolution_. Revolution may be strong; it may even be\r\npleasurable to some persons involved, but as Denis W. Brogan has pointed\r\nout in his _The Price of Revolution_ (Boston, 1952), revolution has a\r\ncost factor which must be weighed against the results expected from it.\r\n\r\nIn the context of mid-twentieth century affairs it is almost pitiable\r\nand endearing to see us Americans of this time, who are so little given\r\nto the drama of fanaticism or the salvation of the world through\r\ncruelty, attempting to dramatize our own modest and reasonable\r\noperations by giving them melodramatic and pretentious labels. If the\r\nCommunists torment us long enough they may make us into alert brutes;\r\nthis seems doubtful now. It seems probable that we will continue to be\r\nbrave without becoming fiendish in combat, strong without becoming\r\nferocious in peace.\r\n\r\nVarying definitions of PsyWar are adopted by official agencies from time\r\nto time. The current (1953) Joint Chiefs of Staff definition runs as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Psychological warfare comprises the planned use of propaganda and\r\nrelated informational measures designed to influence the opinions,\r\nemotions, attitudes, and behavior of enemy or other foreign groups in\r\nsuch a way as to support the accomplishment of national policies and\r\naims, or a military mission.\"\r\n\r\nThis definition differs from the one given in Chapter 3 in the following\r\nimportant respects: it stresses the _planned_ character of PsyWar; it\r\nrestricts the pertinent measures to those of an _informational_\r\ncharacter; and it makes clear the operational goals. It is not clear why\r\nit is necessary to stress the element of planning of PsyWar as\r\ndistinguished from other sorts of war, unless it is a homily to the\r\nPsyWar operator to keep his functions in line with those of other\r\nnational activities. The question of restriction to informational\r\ncharacter is more serious; it excludes the interpretation that in\r\nessence, psychological warfare depends upon warfare psychologically\r\nwaged. Thus, substantive operations of a noninformational character,\r\nadopted and executed primarily for their psychological effect, could\r\nproperly be called PsyWar. Finally, the specification of goals is\r\nchiefly important for the control of the function, and can largely be\r\ntaken for granted. Therefore, to preserve an inclusive view of the\r\nfunction which will comprise the range of variation in official\r\ndefinitions--including those of one's enemies--the author stands by the\r\ndefinition stated in 1946.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Limitations of the American Originators.= There are illusions about\r\npsychological warfare--illusions spread, in many cases, by the\r\noverenthusiastic friends of this kind of operation. Excessive claims\r\nhave been made for the efficacy of propaganda. Sometimes psychological\r\nwarfare has even been offered as a substitute for war or for diplomacy.\r\nOn other occasions Americans have asked that their government do \"as\r\nwell as\" this or that foreign government in the propaganda field,\r\nforgetting that the United States is a republic and a democracy, and\r\ntherefore subject to the sharp limitations which republican, democratic\r\ngovernments possess.[53]\r\n\r\nA republic cannot impose a purpose upon mankind.\r\n\r\nA democracy cannot enounce a policy and then stick to it for years and\r\ndecades.\r\n\r\nAmericans are not Messiahs. The limitations of American civilization\r\nover and above our specific political institutions are such as to make\r\nit impossible for Americans to lead a fanatical counter-crusade against\r\nCommunism, or to guarantee to the human race at large that Americans of\r\n1955 promise that Americans of 1975 will perform this or that specific\r\naction.[54]\r\n\r\n_American_ propaganda is always limited precisely because it is\r\n_American_. Even in an age of atomic weapons, to be _American_ means, to\r\nsome degree at least, to be _free_. The people of this country, or at\r\nthe very least an awful lot of them, _do_ have something to do with\r\noperating the government. A new election and a hostile House of\r\nRepresentatives can cut off the funds for any project no matter what its\r\nmerits may be in the eyes of the top-secret planners. The outside world\r\nknows this even if Washington politicians and bureaucrats sometimes\r\nforget. One can even contradict the title of Archibald MacLeish's famous\r\npoem, _America Was Promises_, and state categorically that in the\r\npropaganda field, America certainly is not promises. The promise of a\r\ntsar or a dictator is usually good for his lifetime, whereas the promise\r\nof the United States is good only within the letter of the law--a\r\nspecific treaty, a definite commercial agreement, a very sharp and very\r\nnarrow commitment.\r\n\r\nThere is an American strength in international affairs. This strength\r\ndoes not lie in a propaganda capacity to promise, to threaten, or to\r\ncommit the United States Government to future courses of action. It\r\nlies, rather, in the immense probabilities of American life, in the\r\nvirtual certainty that the American people will react in such and such a\r\nfashion to a new aggression, that the American people will (if attacked)\r\nin all probability destroy their attackers, whoever those attackers may\r\nbe, and that the American people, despite their occasional shortcomings\r\nin matters of racial tolerance, political freedom, and economic\r\ninjustice, will in the long run be solidly ranged behind whatever\r\npolicies seem to promise equality, prosperity, and freedom for all\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThe limitations of the United States as a source of propaganda are\r\nsharp. There is no U.S. party line; it is virtually impossible to\r\nimagine that within our civilization as we now know it there could be\r\none. There might be an official U.S. line, unanimous and binding upon\r\nall federal departments, but the federal government itself is, after\r\nall, only one among the forty-nine separate governments operating within\r\nthe continental USA. The state governments, the cities within them, and\r\nthe people at large are free to contradict what the federal government\r\nmay say at any given point.\r\n\r\nAmerican strength cannot be sought in unanimity. U.S. propaganda is\r\nincapable of pulling the Sudeten rabbit out of a Munich hat. Short of an\r\nintimate and extreme danger of war itself, the U.S. Government cannot\r\nthreaten a foreign government very successfully; too many U.S. citizens\r\nwould immediately shout at one another, at their own government, and to\r\nthe foreigners concerned: \"Those Washington officials don't really mean\r\nit! We don't want war. We're not going to go through with it.\" If the\r\nUSA moved against Spain, there are friends of Franco in Washington who\r\nwould tell him to sit tight; if the USA moved too rapidly against the\r\nCommunist world, there are plenty of Americans, both in and out of\r\ngovernment, who would say privately, through the press, or by letters\r\nthat the Indian Government or some other should assure Moscow and\r\nPeip'ing that the U.S. would not dare carry through.\r\n\r\nExploitation of U.S. propaganda strength must therefore always be\r\ndeveloped from _the probable or apparent \"center\" of American opinion at\r\nthat moment_. It is impossible to find a U.S. policy which can be made\r\ncompulsory and unanimous upon all Americans both public and private. It\r\nis not impossible through an adroit combination of the skills of\r\nleadership, foresight, and a keen awareness of intra-U.S. politics to\r\ndevise foreign-policy programs which will command the decisive assent of\r\nthe American people.\r\n\r\n\r\n=War and Unanimity.= The less peaceful the world is, the more effective\r\na peacetime information program can be. The attack of the Communist\r\naggressors in Korea, which involved the U.S. armed forces, pushed the\r\nU.S. public into line behind the U.S. Government in a way which no\r\ndegree of propaganda manipulation from Washington could have contrived.\r\nIn times of danger the American people stick together. In times of\r\nrelaxation they scatter about. One should not plan a crusade for the\r\nAmerican people to carry out unless one is sure that someone on the\r\noutside will goad the American people with repeated stings of danger or\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nOnce war breaks out, the American people have in the past shown a very\r\ngood capacity to unite in winning and finishing the war. There is no\r\nreason to suppose that the situation will be different in the future.\r\nWhat is perplexing, and for the present insoluble, is this: how can the\r\nAmerican people, short of getting involved in war, become so purposeful,\r\nso decisive, so nearly unanimous, as to take actions which will prevent\r\na war? The situation in the early 1950s is on the Communist side a major\r\ncrusade against what the Reds regarded, or pretended to regard, as\r\n\"aggressive\" U.S. capitalist power.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the Communists of the world had a crusade against the\r\nUSA. The USA had a crusade against no one. A prominent Washington\r\nofficial long displayed the sign in his office: I Ain't Mad at Nobody.\r\nIn a very real sense this epitomized one of the very real moods of the\r\nAmerican people. How do we defend ourselves against a crusade,\r\nespecially if we have no desire to have part in a counter-crusade?\r\n\r\nU.S. propagandists sometimes forget that they are not speaking for a\r\nmere nation, but are the representatives of something which is far\r\nbigger than any single nationality--they are the spokesmen, whether they\r\nlike it or not, for a way of life which is new in the world, for a kind\r\nof freedom which, though coarse, is real. Characteristic American\r\nstrengths have been, are, and will be the strengths of patience,\r\nendurance, versatility, and curiosity. It is foolish to ask Americans to\r\nbe strong in bitterness, strong in hatred, strong in a cruel or proud\r\nself-righteousness. We are not Japanese, or Prussians, or Russians; we\r\nare not Irish, or English, or French; we are mostly European and yet\r\nun-European. Our propaganda will be effective only if it springs from\r\nthe simplest and strongest aspects of our life at home. Our material\r\nprosperity is beyond doubt; what is not so evident to the outside world\r\nis the frugality, the kindliness, and the humble foresight which drove\r\nso much of that prosperity into being.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Propaganda of Friendship.= U.S. limitations are nowhere more\r\nevident in peacetime propaganda than in the oft-repeated phrase of\r\n\"winning friends for America.\" The desire for having a friend is a deep\r\nnecessity amid the crowded loneliness of U.S. urban society. The\r\nnecessity to \"be liked\" leads to grotesquely exaggerated inferences as\r\nto what \"being liked\" may involve. Americans in and out of government\r\noften argue that America should \"make friends\" on the naïve assumption\r\nthat \"friends\" are useful to nations in time of trouble.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, not true.\r\n\r\nThe Swedes were very good friends of the Norwegians. Nevertheless, the\r\nSwedes saved their Swedish skins by sitting back when the Nazis overran\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\nDid Lithuania have an enemy? Did Latvia have an enemy? Did Estonia have\r\nan enemy? These countries were the good friends of all the Western\r\npowers. These countries have disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe United States was a friend of China, a friendship boastfully and\r\nsentimentally proclaimed for more than a hundred years, from the days of\r\nDaniel Webster to the finale of George C. Marshall. What use was it to\r\nthe Chinese to have the United States as a friend? When they fell upon\r\ntrouble, a U.S. Secretary of State denounced their government as corrupt\r\nand told the Chinese how good the United States was.\r\n\r\nFriendship does not usually lead to war or peace. War and peace depend\r\nupon survival. Any veteran will remember men whom he disliked intensely\r\nin his own wartime outfits: he never day-dreamed of turning them over to\r\nthe enemy just because he was personally antagonistic to them. _A common\r\ndanger from something_--more complicatedly, _a common interest in\r\nsomething_--is a far more potent assurance of future strength and\r\nstrategic action than is friendship.\r\n\r\nFriendship operates between individuals, not between the overgrown\r\ncorporate fictions which are called nations.\r\n\r\nIf you were a West German, and if you were absolutely positive that all\r\nAmericans were lovely people, you would be wise to join the Soviet side.\r\nThat way, if the Russians win, you will have appeased the enigmatic and\r\nimplacable Muscovites. On the other hand, if the Americans win and you\r\nare sure they are lovely people as well as good friends of yours, they\r\nwill not _really_ mind your having joined the other side as a matter of\r\ntemporary factual necessity. If a man is your best friend he may jump\r\ninto the river to rescue you, should you fall in; unfortunately, he\r\nmight prefer to telephone a rescue squad. But if he is handcuffed to\r\nyou, you are reasonably sure that if you fall in he will be with you.\r\n\r\nCall it propaganda, call it information, call it international\r\ncommunication--under any name the major point remains: _Americans can\r\nfind trustworthy future allies through commitment to common interest or\r\ncommon danger_. Friendship is pleasant, but not of the essence. In some\r\ncases it might be desirable for leaders or key groups in important\r\nforeign areas to realize that the United States could be a _worse enemy_\r\nthan the Soviet Union, rather than to realize that the U.S. is a friend.\r\nIf the French were sure of this--that is, that a Soviet-occupied France\r\nwould get sixty-five hydrogen bombs dropped on it while a U.S.-occupied\r\nFrance would get only three--they might prefer the Americans whether\r\nthey liked them or not.\r\n\r\nIs this kind of communication consistent with American ideals? Perhaps\r\nnot. Yet _honesty_ has always been one of the American ideals and\r\nperhaps honesty may take us in the future to a stronger and a wiser\r\nposition than friendliness has taken us in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16\r\n\r\nResearch, Development, and the Future\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychological warfare is part of civilization. Civilization, no matter\r\nhow one defines it, is not a static thing. It is an immense fermenting,\r\nactive, often turbulent composite of the _whys_ and _hows_ of the way\r\nmen and women think and behave. The short-run factors in a civilization\r\nare often as important as the long-run ones. Though the United States\r\nfrom 1860 to 1960 has been a steady part of the west European,\r\npredominantly Christian civilization, the United States has undergone\r\nimmense changes of fashion, belief, appetite, preference, and behavior.\r\nWith any changing, developing civilization, \"war\" may seem like a very\r\nstatic term, so that the Civil War and the war of the Western powers\r\nagainst Germany of 1939-45 may to some degree seem comparable phenomena.\r\nThey are comparable, but only within sharp limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Meaning of War.= Nowhere is the transitoriness and changeability of\r\nmodern civilization more evident than in the significance which\r\nintelligent men and women attach to the term _war_. War was \"noble\" in\r\n1861-65, but in 1941-45 it was \"noble\" only for the most perfunctory and\r\nmost hollow oratory. Push the contrast farther: \"psychological warfare\"\r\nwas an unknown element in 1861-65; by 1941-45 it had become fashionable.\r\n(One can seriously doubt that President Lincoln ever worried about\r\nNorthern citizens becoming \"un-American\" under that rubric, though he\r\nhad plenty of traitors to worry him.) The years 1945-53 were momentous.\r\nA whole string of new ideas, new terms, and new behavior patterns\r\nappeared within the USA in a mere eight years. What the next twenty\r\nyears will bring is deeply uncertain.\r\n\r\nWar is coming to mean the effectuation or prevention of revolution, not\r\nthe half-savage, half-courteous armed conflict of sovereign nations. War\r\nis getting to be chronic again.[55] War between entirely comparable\r\nstates such as the United States and Canada, Mexico and Cuba, Indonesia\r\nand India, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, or any similar combination, is getting\r\nto be more and more unthinkable. War between ideologically dissimilar\r\nstates, such as North Korea and South Korea, Communist China and\r\nNationalist China, Viet Minh and Viet Nam, USSR and USA, is getting to\r\nbe virtual normality.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Research into Tension.= It is true of all people that they solve\r\nparticular problems, in many cases, some time after the occasion for\r\nsolving the problem has passed. What is called \"decision\" in government,\r\npolitics, and in personal affairs is very often not the selection of one\r\nvery real course of action as against another equally real course of\r\naction, but the confirmation of a commitment already made. If this is\r\ntrue of every-day life, it is even more true of scholars and experts.\r\nOne of the disabilities of our time in the field of the social and\r\npsychological sciences and the humanities lies in the fact that although\r\ngovernment officials recognize problems some months or years after they\r\nhave arisen and finally attempt to deal with them, scholars frequently\r\nget around problems decades after any practical occasion for decision\r\nhas passed.[56]\r\n\r\nNowhere is this more evident than in the discussion of tensions as a\r\ncause of war. Tension certainly contributed very much to the outbreak of\r\nwar in 1914. It is possible that the tensions and hostilities of Europe\r\nin the 1930s which allowed Fascism and Communism to become threatening\r\nand powerful also contributed in the end to the outbreak of war in 1939.\r\nIt is difficult, however, to suppose that the coming of war in September\r\n1939 was itself the result of tension except as a very remote and\r\nindirect cause. This author believes that tension leads to a\r\nperpetuation of a kind of civilization in which wars are possible, but\r\ncannot persuade himself that an additional factor of tension within\r\ncivilization as we know it can be an immediate cause of war.[57]\r\n\r\nResearch into tensions has been carried fairly far. It may be that the\r\nwartime role of tension can be ascertained by scientific methods, so\r\nthat the psychological warfare of Power A can cause so much more tension\r\nthan Power B, either among the élite or among the general population,\r\nthat Power B cannot further continue the war. Alternatively, it is\r\nimaginable that Power A may be able to relax tension so sharply among\r\nthe élite or broad population of Power B that Power B's potentiality for\r\nwar, or decision to wage war, can be postponed.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of research it seems worthwhile to suggest that tension\r\nappears to be highly prevalent in the two most powerful military\r\ncivilizations on earth today: the USSR and its satellites, on the one\r\nhand, and the cluster of Western powers, on the other. Tension appears\r\nto be caused by the complexity of every-day life, the demands made upon\r\nthe psychophysiological organization of each individual human being, by\r\nthe technological facilities available, and through the relief offered\r\nwithin each civilization by the opportunity to discharge hatred against\r\nmembers of the other civilization instead of recognizing self-hatred for\r\nthe very real problem which it is.\r\n\r\nIn other terms, it is tough to be modern; the difficulty of being modern\r\nmakes it easy for individuals to be restless and anxious; restlessness\r\nand anxiety lead to fear; fear converts freely into hate; hate very\r\neasily takes on political form; political hate assists in the creation\r\nof real threats such as the atomic bomb and guided missiles, which are\r\nnot imaginary threats at all; the reality of the threats seems to\r\nconfirm the reality of the hate which led to it, thus perpetuating a\r\ncycle of insecurity, fear, hate, armament, insecurity, fear, and on\r\naround the circle again and again.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Revolutionary Possibilities in Psychology.= It is possible, but by no\r\nmeans probable, that the rapid development of psychological and related\r\nsciences in the Western world may provide whole new answers to the\r\nthreats which surround modern Americans, including the supreme answer of\r\npeace as an alternative to war or the secondary answer of victory in the\r\nevent of war. Nothing in the existing academic literature on the subject\r\nof psychology of war, the psychiatry of modern mass behavior, the\r\npsychology or psychiatry of present-day power politics, justifies the\r\ninference that an applicable solution to our \"problems\" is at all near.\r\nThe \"problems\" are almost all aspects of our entire lives and one cannot\r\nsolve life like a Delphic riddle or a single scientific experiment.\r\n\r\nIt would be unwise of U.S. military and political leaders to overlook\r\ndeveloping strengths within American every-day talk and thinking,\r\nwhether academic or popular. Too specific a concentration on the problem\r\nof winning a war may cause a leader or his expert consultants to\r\nconcentrate on solutions derived from past experience, therewith leading\r\nhim to miss new and different solutions which might be offered by his\r\nown time. Changes need not always be thought of as weaknesses, which\r\nthey are if past criteria are retained as absolute standards. Men born\r\nin the period 1910-20 may have endowments which are not commonly found\r\namong men born in the period 1930-40, yet it is entirely possible that\r\nthe generation born during 1930-40 may have capacities and resistances\r\nwhich the older generation does not altogether appreciate.\r\n\r\nApply this concept to Communism. Communism loses strength every day that\r\nit exists: each day deprives it of novelty, each day makes it a littler\r\nmore familiar, each day makes its leaders one day older. If Americans\r\ncan learn how to be flexible and imaginative and to understand\r\nthemselves as they really are, they might find that the real American\r\nappeal to the youth of the world would be much greater than the\r\nCommunist appeal. It was unfortunately characteristic of the United\r\nStates in the early 1950s of the Cold War that U.S. propaganda was based\r\non ideals and standards _older_ than the ideals and standards\r\ncompetitively presented by the Communists, and that therefore in many\r\nparts of the world the struggle between Americans and Communists\r\nappeared to be a struggle on our side of the old against the young.\r\nNothing could be farther from the truth. The United States army in Korea\r\nin 1950-53 was one of the most revolutionary armies in history, an army\r\ndedicated to non-victory, pledging allegiance to a shadowy world\r\ngovernment of the United Nations behind the practical reality of the\r\ngovernment of the United States. Perhaps never before in many centuries\r\nhave men fought so matter-of-factly, so calmly, so reasonably. They\r\nfought well and did not need to be jazzed up with the hashish of \"making\r\nthe world safe for Democracy\" or \"establishing the Four Freedoms.\"\r\n\r\nThe temper of the U.S. forces in Korea in 1951 was demonstrated by a\r\nReserve sergeant who scarcely knew he was in the Reserves until he was\r\non a boat bound for Pusan. He was a practical man, anxious to get home,\r\nbut willing to do his share in this war as long as he had to. He was\r\ngiven the assignment of testing the voice plane of U.S. headquarters at\r\nTaegu. The loudspeaker was not working quite right, and he was\r\ninstructed to test the plane at 500, 1,000 and 1,500 feet. The plane\r\nflew low over U.S. headquarters. The roar of the engines almost deafened\r\neveryone within the building, yet even above the roar of the engines\r\nthere could be heard the bone-chilling hum of the silent loudspeaker--an\r\nimmense magnification of the noise one hears from a radio set which is\r\nturned on without being tuned to a station. Everyone expected the\r\nsergeant to say, \"This is the EUSAK voice plane testing; one-ah, two-ah,\r\nthree-ah!\" Instead the immense voice came through clearly, through\r\nbrick, and plaster, and wood, through air and trees. It must have\r\nreached four miles. The gigantic voice of the sergeant seemed to roar\r\nover half of South Korea as he said, \"Why--don't--you--imperialist--sons o'\r\nbitches--go--back--to--Wall-Street--where--you--belong?\" It was said\r\nthat fifty colonels grabbed for their phones simultaneously, but the\r\npurely American gimmick to the whole story lay in the fact that the\r\nsergeant was not punished. No damage was done. The Americans thought\r\ntheir enemies were funny or silly. We had shown that we were not afraid\r\nof Communist ideas. Several South Koreans told the author that they\r\nregarded the Americans as inscrutable people indeed.\r\n\r\nThe development of modern civilization is certain to have developments\r\nin war both as to the purpose of war and as to the modes of war. It\r\nseems likely that in the face of the supreme danger of atomic and\r\nthermonuclear weapons nations will resort more and more to small wars\r\nand semi-war operations which will offer the opportunity of strategic\r\nadvantage without the cataclysmic danger of a world-wide showdown. In a\r\nvery hush-hush way the U.S. Army is looking into the possibilities of\r\nsmall and irregular kinds of war; security regulations prohibit the\r\nauthor from discussing some of the interesting new developments in this\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n=National Research and Development Programs.= The United States\r\nGovernment considered as a whole has developed a very adequate\r\nscientific research program. Most of this is quite properly keyed to the\r\nphysical and mechanical sciences, in which the most tangible results are\r\nobtained. Substantial strides are being made in the medical and allied\r\nfields. Some research is, however, being carried out in fields\r\npertaining to psychological warfare. These are worth describing, but it\r\nmust be remembered that research on PsyWar may not affect PsyWar itself\r\nas much as research in other fields which, by changing the character of\r\nwar, will change PsyWar too.\r\n\r\nWithin the general research field, two basic approaches have been\r\nrecognized by the U.S. Army as being distinct from one another:\r\ndevelopmental research and operations research. _Developmental research_\r\nconsists of that research which creates new weapons, new methods of war,\r\nnew devices or procedures, doing so by digging through modern science,\r\ninvestigating its applicability to military problems, and then advancing\r\nthe frontier of science, when necessary, in the military interest. The\r\ngoals of _operations research_ are more modest and, in some respect,\r\nmore provocative. Operations research takes operations as they exist and\r\nreexamines them from beginning to end to discover how much of each\r\noperation is scientifically pertinent to its stated goal, what\r\neconomies, modifications, or changes might be introduced, and how the\r\noperation might be improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Developmental Research in PsyWar.= At the time of the close of the\r\n1950-53 phase of Korean hostilities, the PsyWar being conducted by the\r\nUnited States Army in Korea showed little sign of having been influenced\r\nby developmental research into this field of activity. The leaflets were\r\nnot better than the leaflets of World War II, nor even very different.\r\nBecause of the peculiar political limitations of the war, the radio\r\nprogram was not as good as the performance of ABSIE under Eisenhower.\r\nThe tactical use of loudspeakers had shown a very marked improvement\r\nover World War II standards, but to a non-engineer such as the present\r\nwriter neither the Communist loudspeakers nor our own seemed strikingly\r\nbetter or different.\r\n\r\nDevelopmental research had a great deal to offer, but the gap between\r\ninitial scientific advance and practical military application appeared\r\nto be too broad to warrant the assumption that the research had\r\ntransformed the U.S. PsyWar program.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Operations Research in Korea.= Operations research--sometimes slangily\r\ncalled _opsearch_--was applied to the Korean war with highly uneven\r\nresults.[58]\r\n\r\nAmong other things, Army officers in the PsyWar field showed, early in\r\nthe Korean war, that land forces possessed tactical opportunities which\r\ncombat propaganda could exploit very effectually. Various experiments\r\nwere tried, none of them so decisive as to affect the outcome of the\r\nwar, but some of them of real tactical value and others of great\r\nimportance in obtaining Chinese prisoners.\r\n\r\nOne of the points examined was surrender as a _process_. Surrendering\r\ndoes not depend upon the disposition of the individual enemy soldier to\r\nsay _yes_ or _no_ to the war as a whole. He could say _no_ a thousand\r\ntimes and still be on the other side shooting at us.\r\n\r\nThe actual physical _process_ of surrender is an elaborate one\r\nconsisting of the psychological processes of getting ready to give up on\r\nthe other side, the physical capacity to surrender when the opportunity\r\nfor getting captured presents itself, and the alternative, more\r\ndifficult process of deliberately leaving the other side and getting to\r\nour side alive. In 1951 and 1952 there were considerable developments\r\nalong this line. Americans learned much about how to teach enemy\r\nsoldiers to surrender. Late in 1952 and early in 1953 the front had\r\nbecome so static that it took extraordinary heroism for\r\nsoldiers--outside of a tiny minority engaged in reconnaissance\r\npatrols--to get away from their own side and surrender to the enemy\r\nwithout being killed by their friends as deserters or by the enemy as\r\nsneak attackers.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. public did not realize that throughout the Korean war the\r\nCommunists--Russian, North Korean, and Chinese--enjoyed a distinct radio\r\nadvantage over the UN side both as to funds available for programs and\r\nas to number of station-hours on the air. The language gap between the\r\nAmericans and Chinese was so extreme that it was hard for Americans to\r\nrealize that the Chinese broadcasts covered wider audiences and covered\r\nthem better than did our own. American restraint in this field may have\r\nbeen dictated in part by the fact that the war was a limited war\r\nconsisting of combat only with those armed Chinese Communists on North\r\nKorean territory, but not with armed Chinese Communists elsewhere in the\r\nFar East.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Philosophy and Propaganda Development.= In terms of specific literature\r\nof PsyWar it is difficult to find many contributions of professional\r\nphilosophers to PsyWar since the end of World War II. This is curious,\r\nin view of the Communist propagation of philosophy, no matter how\r\nperverted its form, as a major weapon. The American philosopher, Dr.\r\nGeorge Morgan, who became a career diplomat, was simultaneously a\r\nSoviet-area expert and a key figure in the Psychological Strategy Board.\r\nThere were not many others like him.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy offers an opportunity for the reexamination of cultural\r\nvalues. The indoctrination of those professors who will teach the\r\nteachers of the generation after next will influence the capacity of\r\nfuture Americans to have a world-view which will give them the utmost\r\nopportunities for action in the military field while retaining as far as\r\npossible the blessings of U.S. civilian civilization. That U.S.\r\ncivilization is still civilian and not military is, of course, beyond\r\ncavil.\r\n\r\nThe William Jackson committee was a voice crying in the wilderness when\r\nit asked for new terms and new ideas against which to set U.S.\r\npropaganda operations in the world of modern strategy. Philosophers may\r\nhave had the capacity for finding some of the answers, but philosophers,\r\nof all people, do not like to be jostled or hurried. The author has\r\nnever heard of a philosopher employed on a confidential basis by the\r\nUnited States Government to think through the historical and cultural\r\nrationale of a U.S. military victory for the future. Writers such as F.\r\nS. C. Northrop and Erich Fromm--to name only two sharply contrasting\r\npersonalities--have written books which possess high significance for\r\nthe international propaganda field. The connection appears, however, to\r\nbe tangential.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Literary Contributions.= Almost all the best propagandists of almost\r\nall modern powers have been, to a greater or less degree, literary\r\npersonalities. The artistic and cultural aspect of writing is readily\r\nconverted to propaganda usage. Elmer Davis is a novelist as well as a\r\ncommentator. Robert Sherwood is one of America's most distinguished\r\nplaywrights. Benito Mussolini wrote a bad novel. Mao Tse-tung is a poet\r\nand philosopher, as well as a Communist party boss. Down among the\r\nworkers in the field, such American novelists as James Gould Cozzens,\r\nPat Frank, Jerome Weidman, and Murray Dyer, have worked on U.S.\r\npsychological warfare.[59]\r\n\r\nThough literary men have converted their writing to propaganda purposes,\r\nfew of them have gone on to define the characteristics of a specific\r\nconversionary literature or to compile canons of literary style\r\napplicable to the propaganda field. The contributions may lie in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Social Sciences.= The American Association of Public Opinion\r\nResearch (AAOPR) is the professional league of U.S. propagandists and\r\nanalysts of public opinion; its quarterly, _Public Opinion_, is the key\r\njournal in the field. The members of this association are drawn both\r\nfrom the social sciences and from the psychological sciences, ranging\r\nfrom such practical operatives as Dr. George Gallup and Elmo Roper to\r\naustere theorists like Professors Nathan Leites and Hadley Cantril.\r\n\r\nA good argument can be presented to the effect that the skills brought\r\nfrom the social-science into the propaganda field are more valuable once\r\nthey are employed full time in that field than an attempt to apply\r\npolitical science, or sociology, or economics, each as an individual\r\ncompartment, to the field of propaganda. There is still no book\r\navailable with the title _The Politics of Knowledge_,[60] even though\r\nthe reception, control, prohibition, and dissemination of knowledge is a\r\nmajor factor in all modern governmental processes both in and out of the\r\npropaganda field.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Psychology and Related Sciences.= There has been an immense amount of\r\nwork done by psychologists, much of it classified, on the field of\r\npropaganda. Some of this work is refreshing in the extreme and should\r\nprovide nasty surprises for the Communists in a major war. Other parts\r\nare restatements which if translated into operations might or might not\r\nprove feasible with the kind of army we Americans have or are likely to\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nOne of the most conspicuous developments since World War II has been the\r\napplication by psychologists, sociologists, and persons in related field\r\nof _quantifying techniques_. The introduction of rigorous scientific\r\nrequirements of _number_ into the attempted reportage of propaganda\r\nbehavior or propaganda results is having a significant effect.\r\nQuantification may not obtain everything which its devotees claim for\r\nit. There is a wide area of human behavior which is significant to the\r\nordinary person, or even to the expert in descriptive terms, and which\r\nloses much of its significance if the descriptive and allusive terms are\r\nreplaced by measurements, tables, and graphs. There is, however, no\r\ndanger that quantification will replace description as the sole tool of\r\nresearch in the propaganda field.\r\n\r\nWhat quantification does do is develop a common area of discussion\r\nbetween propagandists and nonpropagandists. In many instances\r\nquantification can demonstrate results where allegations of failure or\r\nof success would have nothing more than personal authority to support\r\nthem. Within our own particular kind of civilization quantification has\r\na special appeal because of the American trust in engineering and in\r\nnumbers. The conclusions of the Kinsey reports on men and on women seem\r\nmuch more authoritative to the ordinary man because they are presented\r\nwith an ample garniture of numbers, even though Havelock Ellis's pioneer\r\nworks in the psychology and behavior patterns of Western sex life may\r\nhave been much more tangible and much more revolutionary in their time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Projection and Research.= All propaganda involves a certain degree of\r\nprojection--the propagandist attempts to identify himself with a\r\nsituation which he does not face in real life and to issue meaningful\r\ncommunications to persons about situations which they themselves do not\r\nface _yet_. Much of the psychological research on tactical PsyWar\r\nremains yet to be done, although from the quantitative point of view\r\nthere have been significant U.S. achievements within the past four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of projection is left unexplored because of its immense\r\ndifficulty and its dangerously unscientific character. Consider the\r\nproblem this way: the United States one day before the outbreak of war\r\nwith a hypothetical enemy, such as the Soviet Union, will possess a\r\ncertain group of characteristics. Representative individual lives within\r\nthis country can be determined to possess certain habits concerning mass\r\ncommunication, trust in mass communication, and response to symbols\r\nwhich may come through press, radio, or other mass devices.\r\n\r\nOne day after the outbreak of war the United States will change\r\n_because_ the war has broken out.\r\n\r\nOne month after the outbreak of war the United States will no longer be\r\nthe USA_{1} which existed on war-day. It may well have become USA_{25}\r\nbecause of the rapidity and variety of change. Three Soviet hydrogen\r\nbombs and twelve Soviet atomic bombs might change many of our national,\r\neconomic, political, and psychological characteristics, and no one, not\r\neven an American, could predict this change in advance. The best he\r\ncould do would be to get ready to study the change as it occurred, to\r\nunderstand the rate and direction of the change, and to assess the\r\nmeaning of the change in light of the conduct of war.\r\n\r\nThe same would be true of the USSR; that country, like any other major\r\ncountry, would change under the impact of war. Who could have predicted\r\nthe renascence of Russian patriotism and traditionalism resulting from\r\nthe Nazi invasion of 1941? Even if we know where the Russians are as of\r\nthe outbreak of war, we won't know where they will head or how fast they\r\nwill head there, once war has broken out.\r\n\r\nThe scientific problem presented by attempted serious study of a\r\nU.S.-Soviet war is therefore very difficult indeed. It is really a\r\nproblem involving three clusters of moving bodies. The first cluster\r\nwill be the American people, their behavior, and their institutions; the\r\nsecond cluster, the Russians and allied peoples, their behavior and\r\ntheir institutions; the third cluster, the changing methods of\r\ncommunication existing between them.\r\n\r\nIt can be said even now, simply by referring to the character of the\r\nAmerican people and their past history, that if the Communist leaders of\r\nthe USSR start a general war, the end of that war is sure (under sets of\r\nwords and ideas which have yet to be developed in the future) to involve\r\nthe reconciliation of the inhabitants of the USA with the Russian\r\npeople. In other words, USA_{v} and USSR_{v} can and must have certain\r\nrelationships with each other, preeminent among which are attempts at\r\nundoing war damage, at political and cultural reconciliation, and the\r\nundertaking of the rebuilding of a world which both these great peoples\r\ncan support with enthusiasm and _hope_.[61]\r\n\r\nUSA_{v} and USSR_{v} are imaginable. USA_{1} and USSR_{1} for the day\r\npreceding the outbreak of war, or, alternatively, the day on which the\r\nwar occurs, will be known elements. American science in many fields can\r\nhelp U.S. mass communications and therewith help our armed forces if we\r\nlearn how to ascertain how the Soviet leadership changes, how Soviet\r\nélite groups change, and how the Soviet population changes during the\r\ncourse of the war. We must not only be able to guess what is happening\r\nto them physically, but must try to appreciate and to understand what is\r\nhappening to them psychologically and semantically. This is an immense\r\ntask. It is by no means certain that our research and development\r\nfacilities can give us an adequate research program to handle the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nThis much can be said: if the Americans understand the Russians before\r\nthe war and during the war, it will be the first time that a nation has\r\nkept its enemy in wide-awake sight.\r\n\r\nThe usual process in the past has been the acceptance of a few\r\nexaggerated stereotypes of the national characteristics of the potential\r\nenemy, the ascription of every possible kind of infamy and inhuman\r\ncharacteristic to the enemy during the war, and the redefinition of the\r\nenemy as a friend after the war. It would be strange and wonderful if\r\nthe U.S. Government and the U.S. propagandists (or conceivably as much\r\nas a large minority of the U.S. population) could learn how to fight the\r\nUSSR in order to _help_ the Russians escape from a tyranny which has\r\nalready hurt them much more than it has hurt us.\r\n\r\nThe Germans suffered a tragic, overwhelming, and perhaps decisive\r\npsychological defeat in the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic\r\nand in the Ukraine, when they carried with their field forces such naïve\r\nand tragic Nazi misconceptions of Russian and Ukrainian character as to\r\ndefeat every opportunity they may have had for a serious anti-Communist\r\nalliance of Germany with the Russian and Ukrainian peoples. They\r\ndestroyed themselves not through ignorance, but through what they\r\n_thought_ they knew. If they had been more calm, less assured, more\r\nwilling to learn from immediate experience, and less indoctrinated with\r\ntheir own preposterous misconceptions of Russian and Ukrainian\r\ncharacter, they might have found Russian and Ukrainian allies who would\r\nhave joined them in the final extermination of the Soviet system.\r\n\r\nThe world Communist movement has already suffered very serious setbacks\r\nbecause of its failure to project U.S. behavior successfully from the\r\nsummer of 1950 onward. If the Russian and Chinese Communists had\r\nunderstood Americans well and had made a correct evaluation of the\r\nAmerican response to the invasion of South Korea, they would not have\r\ndriven the United States from lethargy to alertness, from weakness to\r\nmilitary strength, from vulnerability toward Communist and\r\ncrypto-Communist propaganda to sharp and angry recognition of Communist\r\nmanipulation of symbols such as \"progressives,\" \"people's governments,\"\r\nand \"liberation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Communist Developments.= If the U.S. Government agencies know about the\r\nscientific development of Soviet propaganda techniques in the last few\r\nyears, they have certainly not told this author. What is here presented\r\nis therefore derived from first-hand interrogation of Communists, from\r\nescapers in both Europe and Asia, and unclassified materials.\r\n\r\nSociologically it would seem that the Russian Communists attempted\r\ndefinite improvements of the techniques of Communist revolution and that\r\nthese improvements have in large part failed in the European satellites.\r\nThe governments of Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland,\r\nand East Germany have turned out to be poor governments--despite the\r\nfact that from the Soviet point of view it was a sharp innovation to\r\nleave them in pseudo-parliamentary form instead of creating outright\r\nSoviet facsimilies.\r\n\r\nAt the Chinese end of the Moscow-Peking axis the sociology of\r\nrevolutionary propaganda and organization appears to have worked out\r\nmuch more successfully than at the Russian end. The Chinese Communists,\r\nperhaps because they were Chinese, perhaps because they were tougher and\r\nmore experienced Communists than the Russians, got their country under\r\nrigid control and then undertook social and political experiments on a\r\nvery audacious scale. They have managed not to be un-Chinese while\r\ncreating in China the kind of pervasive dictatorship which Communist\r\ncontrol appears to require.\r\n\r\nIn the manipulation of satellites and in particularization of\r\npropaganda, the North Korean Communist army, the Viet Minh army in\r\nIndochina, and the Malayan Races Liberation Army on the Malay peninsula,\r\nappear to have near-optimum localism and particularism without suffering\r\nserious deviation from the main Communist world-wide pattern. In North\r\nKorea, of course, Chinese intervention and Soviet support have sharply\r\nmodified the position of the North Korean People's Army, but the\r\nAnnamite and Malay Communist forces appear to be fighting with high\r\nmorale and considerable success, despite the duality of control from\r\nPeking and Moscow, and despite the difficulties of reconciling Asian\r\nnationalism with Marxian-world doctrine.\r\n\r\nAnother Communist technique is now known through Edward Hunter's\r\nprovocative pioneer book[62] by its correct name of \"brain-washing.\"\r\nThis involves the transformation of a human personality. The author has\r\nhimself interrogated victims of brain-washing and can attest to the\r\nterrifying depth to which this process is carried. The victim of\r\nbrain-washing is subject to very slight persuasion at the rational\r\nlevel. He is not even given much propaganda as U.S. propagandists of\r\nrecent years might recognize the product. Instead, the process of\r\nbrain-washing consists of a frontal attack on all levels of the\r\npersonality, from the most conscious to the most hidden. The Communists\r\nseek through fatigue and sustained interrogation to create a condition\r\nsimilar to what is called \"nervous breakdown\" in popular parlance. Then\r\nthey rebuild the personality, healing their victim into Communist\r\nnormality.\r\n\r\nOne victim to whom the author talked had been so subject to Communist\r\nbrain-changing that he thought himself a real Communist even though he\r\nhad been reared a Catholic. He was completely convinced of the Communist\r\ncause and of his own life and place in that cause after the\r\nbrain-washing had been completed. Unfortunately for Communism, the man\r\ngot into serious sexual difficulties, difficulties of a kind which any\r\nAmerican psychiatrist would recognize as potentially devastating.\r\n\r\nAs a result of his sexual frustrations he suffered a mild equivalent of\r\nthe medically recognized phenomenon of the schizophrenic break--that\r\nterrible moment of false enlightenment in which the psychotic\r\npersonality cuts loose with a truth of his own and shuts off most or all\r\ncommunication with normal people--with the consequence that he was\r\nwalking along Nanking Road in Shanghai, a normal Communist in one\r\ninstant of time and (as he put it to the author) in a millionth of a\r\nsecond he suddenly realized he was a Catholic, an anti-Communist, the\r\nenemy of every man, woman and child in sight--and at war with his entire\r\nenvironment. As this writer understood it, the poor man, though adjusted\r\nto the Communist environment after brain-washing, happened to go\r\ncrazy--crazy enough to come back to our side.\r\n\r\nWho can say which is sane, which insane? When two social and cultural\r\nsystems are completely at odds with one another it may be impossible to\r\nbe \"normal\" in both of them.\r\n\r\nScientifically the Chinese process of personality transformation lacked\r\nsome of the pharmaceutical features apparent in the Western Communist\r\nconversions for purposes of confession. It appears to be a combination\r\nof audacious practical experimentation with well-known procedures from\r\ntextbooks of Pavlovian psychology. It is, of course, an interesting\r\nscientific question to ask one's self: could Communist psychological\r\nresearchers do enough psychological research to understand their own\r\ndifficulties and to de-Communize themselves in the very act of seeking\r\nbetter psychological weapons for Communism? If the people in charge of\r\nCommunist psychological techniques were scientists, as American\r\npsychologists generally are, there might be a real point of discussion.\r\nUnfortunately, most of them appear to be artists, believers, and\r\nfanatics. The history of the fanatical religions which have inflamed and\r\nripped so much of mankind across the centuries is not such as to suggest\r\nthat Communism will de-Communize itself by becoming more Communistic or\r\nmore scientific.\r\n\r\nLogically considered, the United States remains the largest extant\r\nrevolutionary experiment in the world--the first immense human community\r\nwhich survives without profound dogma or profound hatred and which\r\nattempts to make short-range, practical, and warm-hearted (though\r\nideologically superficial) concurrence the foundation for a political\r\nand industrial civilization. If the United States wins a few more wars\r\nit may be that the rest of mankind will be persuaded that our kind of\r\npracticality is not only humanly preferable, but scientifically more\r\ndefensible than the philosophies of competing civilizations. It seems\r\nunlikely that Communist research can outstrip us in the propaganda field\r\nso far as the race is run in purely scientific terms; artistically and\r\ngadget-wise the Communists are just as inventive as we are and often\r\nmore enthusiastic.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Private PsyWar and Covert Techniques.= Another aspect in the\r\ndevelopment of PsyWar was the inevitable possibility that skills\r\nlearned in wartime would not be forgotten in time of peace. Many of the\r\nbackground studies made for OWI during World War II have been developed,\r\non the constructive side, into serious scientific contributions to\r\nethnology, anthropology, or psychology. The postwar studies of RAND\r\nCorporation have in part been released in unclassified form and add to\r\nour knowledge not only of propaganda but of mankind. The RADIR project\r\nat Stanford University, the Russian research program at MIT and Harvard,\r\nand other governmentally inspired or encouraged undertakings have borne\r\nsimilar fruit for private scholarship and discussion.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the coin, it is very hopeful to note that the many\r\nand dangerous techniques developed by OSS for covert propaganda, some of\r\nwhich were applied with considerable success in Europe, have not been\r\nintroduced into domestic U.S. politics, commercial competition, or other\r\nforms of private life. After each war there is often a danger that the\r\ncoarsening of a culture by the war will lead to the application of\r\nwartime skills to peacetime situations. This was emphatically not the\r\ncase in the Presidential campaigns of 1948 and 1952, even though persons\r\nof rich PsyWar experience in World War II were on the staffs of both\r\nStevenson and Eisenhower.\r\n\r\nIt is often forgotten that some of the deadliest and most effective\r\nrevolutionary enterprises in the nineteenth century were undertaken\r\nwithout the consent or assistance of the existing governments. Karl Marx\r\nwas certainly not an invention of Lord Palmerston. Bakunin did not\r\noperate out of the French Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nIn the postwar discussion of USA-Communist rivalry, recommendations were\r\noften made on the U.S. side that we should counter Soviet covert\r\noperations with our own covert operations against the USSR. What has\r\nbeen forgotten in this context is the fact that such operations have\r\nbeen made illegal and dangerous under United States law. Under Federal\r\nlaw as it exists today no Underground Railway could be developed to\r\nassist Soviet escapers in the way that Negro slaves were relayed across\r\nthe Free States to Canada in the years before Emancipation. One of the\r\nchief blocks to U.S. covert operations is the immense growth in all\r\ndirections of the power, authority, and responsibility of the Federal\r\nGovernment; this growth makes it almost impossible to wage revolutionary\r\nor conspiratorial operations from U.S. territory without the prior\r\napproval of U.S. authorities--which the authorities, under traditional\r\ninternational law, cannot give and cannot afford to give.\r\n\r\nIt would seem desirable, if the Cold War situation persists over a long\r\nperiod of time, for Americans to reexamine the restraints which they\r\nhave placed upon their own citizens and to attempt a revision of the\r\nlaws which would permit pro-American secret activities to be launched\r\nwithout permitting anti-American activities of the same kind to be\r\ncarried on. One immediately comes to the conundrum:[63]\r\n\r\nHow can the Government say _yes_ to the one and _no_ to the other\r\nwithout being cognizant of what happens?\r\n\r\nThe answer would appear to lie in the older body of our law in that a\r\nwithdrawal of governmental authority from some fields would leave the\r\nindividual responsible and subject to indictment and trial if his\r\nenterprises should prove deleterious to the United States Government,\r\nbut not subject to punishment if his enterprises hurt the known\r\nantagonists of the USA.\r\n\r\nPhrased in another way, this means that the USA might, in a long-range\r\nCold War situation, be required to make some domestic recognition of the\r\nfact that the Communist states are the antagonists but not the military\r\nenemies of the U.S. system of government and that as antagonists of this\r\nsystem of government such states, their representatives, their property,\r\nand their organizations, should not be afforded any more protection\r\nunder our laws than is given to the National City Bank of New York in\r\nthe laws applicable to the city of Moscow, or the American Telephone &\r\nTelegraph Company in the laws which apply in Budapest. For a long time\r\nthe Communist states have treated even the most innocent business\r\nenterprise and social club on our side as though they were attainted\r\nwith an inherent factor of criminal and subversive intent. The\r\nwithdrawal of U.S. legal protection from all things Communist might\r\nallow the American people--or those among them who so chose--to develop\r\nproclivities for adventure and trouble-making against the Communists.\r\nThese proclivities are now sternly repressed by Federal statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Future of Psychological Warfare.= PsyWar has become an existing\r\nart. Where it had no practitioners at all in the United States between\r\n1919 and 1940, it has had a long and distinguished roster of active and\r\nreserve officers, civilian consultants, and demobilized veterans\r\ninterested in the field ever since 1945. A wide variety of military\r\nestablishments have had PsyWar responsibilities assigned them.\r\nSubstantial cadres of officers and skilled enlisted personnel have been\r\nrecruited and trained. Radio and leaflet facilities are ready to\r\naccompany our land, sea, and air forces wherever they may have to go. A\r\nU.S. strategic center for global propaganda, instantly convertible to\r\nwartime use, exists in the Operations Coordinating Board under the\r\nNational Security Council.\r\n\r\nThis is not the end of the story.\r\n\r\nOne of the paradoxical but deeply true factors in the study and conduct\r\nof propaganda is this: the more people know about propaganda, the better\r\nthey can resist it.\r\n\r\nPropaganda was a tremendous bogey in the 1920s. It probably seems very\r\nugly and frightening to most people born before 1920. It does not seem\r\ntoo frightening, so far as the author can judge, to Americans born after\r\n1930. Those born in the period 1920-30 appear to be divided in their\r\nemotional reactions to mass persuasion situations.\r\n\r\nPsyWar is not magic. It is a valuable auxiliary to modern warfare and a\r\nuseful concomitant to modern strategy. If a particular strategic policy\r\nis sanely and effectively devised as a feasible deterrent to war, the\r\nPsyWar procedures supporting that strategy will contribute to the\r\nprevention of war. Psychological warfare represents a recognition and\r\nacceptance in the military and strategic field of skills which grow\r\nabout us every day.\r\n\r\nIn so far as ultra-destructive weapons may have increased the tenseness\r\nand bad temper of people who must live under the perpetual but remote\r\nthreat of atomic bombing, one can say that physicists have upset the\r\nnerves of mankind and that it is now up to the propagandists to reassure\r\nand to reconcile the peoples.\r\n\r\nWhatever PsyWar does, it certainly does not and should not increase the\r\nbitterness of war. Fighting itself is the supreme bitterness. Radio\r\nbroadcasts and leaflets even in wartime only rarely should promote\r\nhatred. The situation which the world faces is dangerous because of\r\ntechnological development, not because of psychological knowledge.\r\nPsyWar ranks as a weapon, but it is almost certainly the most humane of\r\nall weapons.\r\n\r\nApart from PsyWar, what military weapon destroys the enemy soldier's\r\ncapacity to fight by saving his life? PsyWar tries to bring him over\r\nalive and tries to send him home as our friend. No rival weapon can do\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nPsyWar, no matter what it may be called in the future, cannot be omitted\r\nfrom the arsenal of modern war. Neither can it outlast war. Its\r\nimprovement is a cheap, valuable, and humane way of increasing the\r\nmilitary potential of any country whether we think that country to be\r\npolitically right or politically wrong.\r\n\r\nSince 1945 we Americans have written more, studied more, and talked more\r\nabout PsyWar than have any of the other free peoples. This is a hopeful\r\nsign. It can be read as an indication that the American love of the\r\ngadget, the American quest for a novelty, can be turned to the arena of\r\nthe soul. The Communists are better liars, better schemers, better\r\nmurderers than we shall ever be; they start off by being better\r\nfanatics. Is it not in the American spirit that we should out-trick\r\nthem, out-talk them, and out-maneuver them? We have a very creative and\r\nresourceful civilization at our backs. We have no Führer to guide us and\r\nno party line to comfort us; we don't even want such things. Hard though\r\nit may be, we can live with our own consciences and not seek for\r\nkeepers.\r\n\r\nThe Communists have started a fight with us. That fight may go on a long\r\ntime. If they want to stop fighting we shall certainly try to find peace\r\nwith them. But if they push the fight to its bitter end--\r\n\r\nWe shall not fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nMilitary PsyWar Operations, 1950-53\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 25 June 1950, when the invasion of the Republic of Korea began, no\r\nreal military PsyWar organization was tangibly evident. A planning staff\r\nheaded by Colonel J. Woodall Greene had been re-created in the Far East\r\nCommand's GHQ in 1947, but it was hardly prepared to direct full-scale\r\npropaganda operations on such short notice, especially with a total lack\r\nof field operating units. Yet the staff with hasty augmentation did go\r\ninto action--in effect, became its own operating unit--two days\r\nfollowing the invasion, using both leaflets and radio in a strategic\r\ncampaign that was continued without interruption for over three years.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that General MacArthur made provision for the PsyWar\r\nplanning staff in the Far East Command, the Department of the Army's G2\r\nin 1947 directed the inauguration of a long-range program of extension\r\ncourses to be administered primarily to the specialists of the Military\r\nIntelligence Reserve. One such specialty in the military intelligence\r\ncareer program was psychological warfare.[64]\r\n\r\nParallel with the development of training literature based on World War\r\nII experience, the Army experimented with the use of PsyWar in field\r\nmaneuvers. A special unit, called the Tactical Information\r\nDetachment,[65] was formed at Fort Riley, Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Organization of Field Operational Units.= Less than a month after the\r\n1950 invasion, the Department of the Army announced the approval of a\r\nnew organizational concept for PsyWar field operational units. The new\r\nconcept, profiting by the organizational happenchance in all theaters of\r\noperations during World War II, established two functional units: one\r\nfor _strategic_ propaganda support, the other for _tactical_ propaganda\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Radio Broadcasting and Leaflet Group.= Although the concept for new\r\nunit organization and function was not conceived overnight, FEC's\r\nPsychological Warfare Section (PWS) with its dual planning and\r\noperating responsibilities pointed up the urgent need for a unit\r\nproperly manned and equipped to support full-scale strategic operations\r\nin any area. So the Radio Broadcasting and Leaflet (RB&L) Group was\r\nborn. Not only was it designed to conduct strategic propaganda in direct\r\nsupport of military operations, but it likewise was created to support\r\nthe national world-wide propaganda effort when so directed. It was built\r\non a basic framework of three companies:\r\n\r\n_Headquarters and Headquarters Company_, containing the command,\r\nadministrative, supervisory and creative personnel necessary for\r\npropaganda operations.\r\n\r\n_Reproduction Company_, containing intricate equipment and skilled\r\npersonnel capable of producing leaflets and newspapers of varying sizes\r\nand multiple color.\r\n\r\n_Mobile Radio Broadcasting Company_, designed to replace or augment\r\nother means of broadcasting radio propaganda.\r\n\r\nIn 1953 a fourth type company was activated at Fort Bragg, North\r\nCarolina--the _Consolidation Company_. This unit was very flexible and\r\nhad the job of creating and conducting PsyWar in support of\r\nconsolidation operations in areas under Military Government control.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 75: UN Propaganda._ In some leaflets used in\r\nKorea, the United Nations emerged as a major point. Here UN lavishness\r\nto South Korea is contrasted with Communist rapacity in the North. The\r\nscene does not remind the reader of slums on our side.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Loudspeaker and Leaflet Company.= The Group's junior partner in the\r\nconduct of PsyWar support operations was the Loudspeaker and Leaflet\r\n(L&L) Company. This unit specifically supported an army in the field\r\nwith adequate _tactical_ propaganda support. Like the Group, it\r\nsupported the national propaganda objectives, but it interpreted the\r\ndirectives that came from the theater commander in terms of more\r\nimmediate objectives. Its targets were smaller, lived under unusual\r\ncircumstances, and presented highly vulnerable, rapidly changing\r\npropaganda opportunities--a real challenge for the L&L Company.\r\nOrganizationally it was a trimmed-down version of the Group. Its\r\n_company headquarters_ and _propaganda platoon_ were the offspring of\r\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company. The _publications platoon_ was a\r\nsmaller, more adaptable version of Reproduction Company. And the\r\n_loudspeaker platoon_ was the tactical counterpart of the strategic\r\nMobile Radio Broadcasting Company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 76: Korean Leaflet Bomb, Early Model._ An M16A1\r\ncluster adapter being loaded at the FEC printing plant in Yokohama (1\r\nNovember 1950). The bomb type adapter will contain 22,500 (5\" by 8\")\r\npsychological warfare leaflets.]\r\n\r\nThe Tactical Information Detachment, moving from Fort Riley to Korea in\r\nthe fall of 1950, was reorganized as the _1st Loudspeaker and Leaflet\r\nCompany_ and, attached to EUSAK, served as Eighth Army's tactical\r\npropaganda unit throughout the campaign. It adjusted its location,\r\nequipment and propaganda tone to keep pace with the ups and downs of the\r\nKorean war.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Psychological Warfare Center.= Paralleling the creation of the Office\r\nof the Chief of Psychological Warfare in the Department of the Army\r\nPsyWar training was started in the spring of 1951. A faculty was\r\ncollected at the Army General School to start the world's first formal\r\nschool of military propaganda.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, reserve officers whose civilian specialties were in or\r\nrelated to mass communications were recalled to PsyWar assignments.\r\nSeveral RB&L groups and L&L companies were activated and trained at Fort\r\nRiley. One of these, the _1st Radio Broadcasting and Leaflet Group_, was\r\ndeployed to Japan to become the strategic propaganda support unit in\r\nFEC, thereby relieving the hard-pressed Psychological Warfare Section of\r\nits operational functions. The Group left Fort Riley in July 1951 at the\r\nheight of the Missouri Valley floods, forcing the unit to take emergency\r\ndetours by bus and train in order to meet its scheduled port of\r\nembarkation call. The 1st was the only group to have been used in active\r\noperations. Other groups were employed in training missions. In\r\naddition, Reserve groups and companies trained periodically at key\r\nlocations where sufficient specialized personnel were available to keep\r\nthe units on a ready, stand-by basis.\r\n\r\nIn April 1952, the PsyWar training activities at Fort Riley were moved\r\nto Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where the new Psychological Warfare\r\nCenter was located. This Center not only provided unit training\r\nsupervision and facilities, but it fathered a new activity, the\r\nPsychological Warfare Board, designed to evaluate and test new PsyWar\r\nequipment and techniques. And the Psychological Warfare School, an\r\noutgrowth of the classes conducted by the Army General School, was\r\nformally recognized and established as one of the Army's specialist\r\nschools. More than four hundred officers have received diplomas as\r\nPsyWar officers at the time of this writing (1953). Most of the\r\ngraduates have been Army officers, although successfully completing the\r\ncourse have been students from the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, U.S.\r\nInformation Agency, and from nine Allied nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Psychological Warfare Staff, FEC.= For nearly two years, the\r\nPsychological Warfare Section operated under the general staff\r\nsupervision of Intelligence (G2). Since World War I days G2 had been\r\ngiven the responsibility for monitoring PsyWar activity, a practice that\r\nwas evident throughout World War II. In 1947 the Department of the Army\r\ntransferred the monitorship and supervision of PsyWar to Plans and\r\nOperations (G3). The shift was effected in FEC in 1952.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 77: UN Themes._ This Korean-language leaflet\r\nstates: \"No soldier would attempt to fight 54 men, yet Communist China\r\nis attempting to fight 54 nations. Don't fight for Communist\r\nenslavement--Join your comrades who have surrendered into safety.\"]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1953 PWS was transferred to the staff of the commander, Army\r\nForces Far East (AFFE), a paper transaction to put the staff in a closer\r\nposition to coordinate the plans and operations of the supporting army\r\nPsyWar units.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Korean conflict, PWS, like its area commander, wore two\r\nhats: PWS was also the PsyWar operations coordinating agency for the\r\nUnited Nations Command.\r\n\r\nBroad objectives made possible throughout the war years the development\r\nof literally thousands of appropriate themes. One theme so prominent in\r\nWorld War II propaganda, that of _unconditional surrender_, was never\r\nused. UN policy denied its use, and PWS enforced the prohibition.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Psychological Warfare Staff, EUSAK.= Recognizing the need for PsyWar\r\nofficers on army and corps staffs, the Department of the Army hastened\r\nto make an allocation for these officers to be integrated into\r\nheadquarters structures. The PsyWar officers finally came to rest in the\r\nG3 staff section.\r\n\r\nEighth Army's PsyWar division of G3 had the 1st Loudspeaker and Leaflet\r\nCompany under its operational control. EUSAK's PsyWar officer kept a\r\ntight control over the propaganda output of the L&L Company by\r\nphysically moving the propaganda platoon into his EUSAK staff office.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 78: Home-front Morale._ When South Korean\r\ncommunications were interrupted, leaflets such as this provided on early\r\nboost to Korean civilian morale.]\r\n\r\nEach of the corps PsyWar officers had under his operational control one\r\nloudspeaker section (with a varying number of teams) from the L&L\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Radio Operations.= Radio in the Korean conflict was used jointly as a\r\nstrategic and a consolidation medium. From the beginning of the war,\r\nradio was the voice of our military policy. An ambitious network,\r\nsupervised in 1950-51 directly by PWS and thereafter by the 1st RB&L\r\nGroup, became known and recognized as the Voice of the United Nations\r\nCommand. The Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) and the Japan Broadcasting\r\nSystem (JBS) transmitted on a cooperative basis, with the U.S.\r\nGovernment buying air time. The 1st RB&L Group's radio unit furnished\r\nprogramming assistance through key stations in Seoul (KBS), Taegu (KBS),\r\nPusan (KBS) and Tokyo (JBS). In addition, the Group furnished technical\r\nassistance to KBS in order to keep as many as twelve network stations on\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Leaflet Operations.= As in World War II, leaflets were delivered\r\nprimarily by two means: aircraft and artillery. B-29s of the Far East\r\nAir Force ferried leaflet bombs on night missions deep into strategic\r\nareas. Light bombers and liaison craft in support of EUSAK dropped both\r\nleaflet bombs and bundles on tactical targets. The leaflet bundle was a\r\nKorean war development. It was wrapped, tied, and fuzed in such a manner\r\nthat it would open and release its leaflets in mid-air. The 105mm.\r\nhowitzer remained the principal artillery piece for placing\r\npropaganda-loaded shells on pinpoint targets.\r\n\r\nTremendous quantities of leaflets were printed. The 1st RB&L Group on\r\nmany occasions averaged better than twenty million pieces of printed\r\npropaganda every week. To this, the 1st L&L Company in Korea added an\r\naverage of three and a half million leaflets per week.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Loudspeaker Operations.= The airborne loudspeaker was the object of\r\nexperimentation, but the bulk of loudspeaker broadcasts were made from\r\nvehicle mounts, such as tanks, and from emplacements. During the static\r\nbattle situation of 1951-53, most of the broadcasts were of the latter\r\nkind. Range of the voice casts was short, something like two thousand\r\nyards under ideal conditions. Personnel and equipment were supplied by\r\nthe 1st L&L Company, and scripts were prepared by PsyWar Division, G3,\r\nEUSAK.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Results of Military PsyWar Operations.= When the question was asked,\r\n\"Just how effective was PsyWar?\" the answer was vague. Clear-cut\r\nimmediate evaluation of the effects of each propaganda campaign was\r\noften impossible to ascertain because of the many intangible conditions\r\nthat were prevalent in the target area--conditions that were constantly\r\nchanging.\r\n\r\nSome critics of the PsyWar operations in the Far East Command charged\r\nthat there were exaggerated claims of prisoners of war who surrendered\r\nas a result of propaganda. They pointed out that a head count of\r\nprisoners is an inaccurate measure of _direct_ effects of PsyWar used in\r\nsupport of military operations, because rarely is the taking of\r\nprisoners the _sole_ goal of any major PsyWar campaign.\r\n\r\nOther critics expressed the belief that emphasis had been placed on\r\n_quantity_ rather than _quality_ of propaganda. By quantity they meant\r\npropaganda measured by bookkeeping statistics. By quality they meant\r\npropaganda that, planned with potent intelligence, was capable of\r\nexploiting propaganda opportunities with maximum psychological impact.\r\n\r\nDid PsyWar achieve its goal?\r\n\r\nThe effects of planned persuasion in a thousand days of radio\r\nbroadcasts, in tens of thousands of loudspeaker appeals, in billions of\r\nleaflets, may be measured only in retrospect. The question may be\r\nanswered when reaction in the target area has reached (or fails to\r\nreach) favorable proportion, provided that the tangible results of the\r\nmilitary operations can be clearly separated from those of concurrent\r\nand subsequent strategic international information operations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 79: The Famous Airplane Surrender Leaflet._ This\r\nis the controversial Far East Command leaflet that in April 1953 offered\r\n\"the sum of 50,000 U.S. dollars to any pilot who delivers a modern,\r\noperational, combat-type jet aircraft in flyable condition to South\r\nKorea. The first pilot who delivers such a jet aircraft to the free\r\nworld will receive an additional 50,000 U.S. dollars bonus for his\r\nbravery.\" The leaflet was printed in three languages--Russian, Chinese\r\nand Korean. In this example of the Russian language leaflet, there are\r\nadded notations in both Korean and Chinese that \"this is a message from\r\nthe Americans to any jet pilot who can read Russian. If you know such a\r\nperson, please give it to him. It tells him how to escape to the UN\r\nForces.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Histories of warfare, of politics (though there are no good recent\r\nones, Edward Jenks' little book being half a century out of date), of\r\npolitical theory (especially the excellent though dissimilar volumes by\r\nG. H. Sabine and by G. E. C. Catlin), of particular countries, of\r\ndiplomacy, of religion, and even of literature all cast a certain amount\r\nof light on the subject. No writer known to the author specializes in\r\nthe topic of historical propaganda; none takes up the long-established\r\nhistorical role of non-violent persuasion in warfare. Some of the\r\nsociologists and anthropologists, such as Karl Mannheim, Max Weber,\r\nTalcott Parsons, Geoffrey Gorer, Ruth Benedict (to mention a few at\r\nrandom) have presented approaches which would justify re-evaluations of\r\nhistory in a way useful to propaganda students; but they have not yet\r\npersuaded the historians to do the work.\r\n\r\n[2] 7 Judges 22-23.\r\n\r\n[3] Leon Wieger, S.

Comparable\r\nstudies have not yet been written concerning other American wars.\r\nMilitary and civilian historians have a fascinating piece of research\r\nawaiting them in the material concerning Confederate and Federal\r\npsychological warfare. Each participant in the Civil War was vulnerable\r\nto the propaganda of the other. Subversive and clandestine\r\npro-Confederate propaganda in the North is outlined in George Fort\r\nMilton's engrossing _Abraham Lincoln and the Fifth Column_, New York and\r\nWashington, D.

They are worth study as good propaganda.\r\n\r\n[11] In his _The Political Doctrines of Sun Yat-sen_, Baltimore, 1937,\r\npage 17 and following, this author attempted to present some of the\r\nrelationships of ideology to other methods of social control and, in\r\nconnection with that enterprise, was furnished by the philosopher, A.O.\r\nLovejoy, with a definition of \"ideology\" more systematic and more\r\nelaborate than the one used here.\r\n\r\n[12] For example, in the 1920's the Soviet press expressed resentment\r\nand amusement over a ruse adopted by the British during the course of\r\noperations along the Northwest Frontier. Plane-mounted loudspeakers had\r\ntold the tribesmen, in Pushtu, that God was mad at them for having\r\nbroken the pledged peace, with the result that they scattered and gave\r\nup. This maneuver exasperated the Russians, who themselves were making\r\nequally sweeping propaganda inroads on the other side of the Pamirs. The\r\nRussians were attacking religion, and having heavy going; it struck them\r\nas improper warfare to make use of local superstition.\r\n\r\n[13] _Webster's New International Dictionary_, Second Edition,\r\nSpringfield, 1944.\r\n\r\n[14] The late Huey Long is reported to have created a new word in the\r\nlanguage of rustic Louisiana, the word \"damlyingnewspapers.\" By\r\ninstilling in his followers contempt for the \"capitalist\" press, he got\r\nthem to the point where they _disbelieved_ anything which they saw in\r\nprint, and _believed_ everything which \"Ol' Huey, the Kingfish\" himself\r\ntold them. This operation was technically competent, since one of the\r\nmost effective means of putting propaganda across is to draw alarmed\r\nattention to unfriendly propaganda and then just \"happening to mention\"\r\nthe \"truth\" (that is, the promoted side). Long attributed to the\r\nnewspapers a large number of lies which they did not print, along with\r\nthe \"lies\" (which were in historical fact true) that they _did_ actually\r\nprint. Since most of his followers either boycotted the press or read it\r\nin a hostile frame of mind, they never found out whether the newspapers\r\nsaid what Huey said they said, or not. You can try this out on your\r\nneighbors or friends by making up some idiotic \"quotation\" (such as,\r\n\"The Jewish _Vorwaerts_ says that pickled onions are a cause of\r\nimmorality\" or \"_Le Temps_ of Paris says that Alaska is preparing to\r\nsecede\") and the listener will be so busy scoffing at _what_ the paper\r\nallegedly said that he will take no time to find out whether the paper\r\n_did_ say it or not. Such attributions occur in everyday life; the smart\r\npropagandist attributes plenty of rich, ripe, silly quotations to his\r\nopponent. How many people actually _know_ what the Communists have said\r\non any given topic? Or bother to check on the actual claims of the\r\nZionist organization? Or the statements of the Arabs in Palestine?\r\n\r\n[15] The literature in this field is carefully described in two volumes\r\nby a three-man team consisting of Harold D. Lasswell, Ralph D. Casey and\r\nBruce Lannes Smith, the first being _Propaganda and Promotional\r\nActivities, An Annotated Bibliography_, Minneapolis, 1935, and the\r\nsequel being _Propaganda, Communication and Public Opinion, A\r\nComprehensive Reference Guide_, Princeton, 1946. The booklists provide\r\nmaterial in plenty for any academic-minded inquirer. The essays in the\r\ntwo volumes are well worth reading, although the authors have undergone\r\nthe professorial delight of inventing a private language of their own.\r\nParts of the latter book, especially, read like proceedings out of an\r\nunfamiliar lodge meeting; but there is sound sense and acute observation\r\nbehind the vocabulary. It must, however, be parenthetically noted that\r\nduring World War II the key propaganda jobs were held by a radio\r\ncommentator, a dramatist, a newspaperman, a New York banker, and an\r\nabsolutely astonishing number of men from commercial radio--along, of\r\ncourse, with a sprinkling of Army and Navy officers in Washington, and a\r\nheavy majority of non-specialist officers in the field. The propaganda\r\nexperts were not, in most instances, called in to do the actual chore of\r\npropaganda. Among the exceptions were Leonard W. Doob, author of\r\n_Propaganda, Its Psychology and Technique_, New York, 1935, who served\r\nin the War Department's Psychological Warfare Branch and in the\r\nWashington propaganda center at OWI; C. A. H. Thomson, who served as a\r\npropaganda staff officer both in Washington and overseas after being a\r\ncollaborator with the Lasswell group; and Drs. Edwin Guthrie and A. L.\r\nEdwards, whose chapter \"Psychological Warfare\" in [E. G. Boring, editor]\r\n_Psychology for the Fighting Man_, Washington, 1943, pp. 430-447, is a\r\nlucid epitome of the topic.\r\n\r\n[16] This means that if you want to get baptised, you've got to get\r\n_all_ the way under the water or it doesn't count.\r\n\r\n[17] See Doob's book, mentioned above, especially pages 71 through 89\r\nand 413 through 417.\r\n\r\n[18] See the bibliographies by Harold Lasswell and others, mentioned\r\nabove, for a wealth of literature giving more technical and scientific\r\nbreakdowns than this. The formula STASM represents what was actually\r\nused in preparation of up-to-the-minute propaganda spot analysis for the\r\nWar Department General Staff by Propaganda Branch during World War II.\r\nSome further aspects of this formula are presented in my article,\r\n\"Stasm: Psychological Warfare and Literary Criticism\" in _The South\r\nAtlantic Quarterly_, Vol. 46, No. 3, July 1947, pp. 344-348.\r\n\r\n[19] See Harold Lasswell's _Propaganda Technique in the World War_, New\r\nYork, reissue 1938, Chapter II, \"Propaganda Organization,\" for a\r\ndescription of the attempts to coordinate policy and propaganda in World\r\nWar I.\r\n\r\n[20] Chicago, 1946. The discussion of what censorship authorities\r\nregarded as propaganda material possessing value for the enemy, of the\r\nwartime OC-OWI relationship, and of censorship of short-wave broadcasts\r\nare of particular interest to the student of psychological warfare.\r\n\r\n[21] In a somewhat different context, it is interesting to note that\r\nChinese Protestant churches, made up of Chinese church members, like to\r\nhire ministers who mouth their Chinese with a strong American accent.\r\nThe American missionaries established the American accent as part of the\r\nliturgical paraphernalia of Protestantism, and the Chinese preachers\r\ntrained under them accepted the American mispronouncing of Chinese as a\r\npart of the religion. It is odd to see a church full of Chinese using\r\nabsolutely unbelievable tones while singing hymns or making appropriate\r\nindividual responses. At that, they are no funnier than the Chinese\r\nBuddhists, who memorize long Indian sutras without understanding a\r\nsingle syllable.\r\n\r\n[22] On World War I, see Harold Lasswell's _Propaganda Technique in the\r\nWorld War_, previously cited; George Creel's _How We Advertised\r\nAmerica_, New York and London, 1920, the very title of which is an\r\nindication of its chief shortcoming; Lt. Col. W. Nicolai,\r\n_Nachrichtendienst, Presse und Volksstimmung im Weltkrieg_, Berlin,\r\n1920, by the German general staff officer chiefly responsible for staff\r\nwork on propaganda and public opinion, a very thoughtful though\r\nprejudiced book; Heber Blankenhorn's enjoyable little classic,\r\n_Adventures in Propaganda_, Boston, 1919 (Blankenhorn was the only\r\nAmerican officer to see field service in propaganda in both wars, as a\r\nCaptain in I and a Lieutenant Colonel in II); and George G. Bruntz'\r\nscholarly monograph _Allied Propaganda and the Collapse of the German\r\nEmpire_ in 1918, Stanford, 1938. Readers desiring further references\r\nshould consult the bibliographies by Lasswell, Casey and Smith, cited\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[23] Colonel Nicolai, book cited in footnote 1. pages 160-161.\r\n\r\n[24] For a pro-Hitler view of the world, see Wyndham Lewis' _Hitler_,\r\nLondon, 1931, if a copy is to be found. The author would probably prefer\r\nfor the book to disappear. It is an eloquent, very pro-Nazi book,\r\nputting the Hitlerite terminology into the English language and--what is\r\nmore important--infusing into the clumsy German pattern of\r\nthinking-and-feeling a lightness of touch which makes Naziism more\r\npalatable. The book converted no one in its time, and is not apt to do\r\nharm at this late date; but it will make the English-reading reader\r\nunderstand some of the novelty, the revolutionary freshness, the bold\r\nunorthodoxy which made millions of people turn to Hitlerism as an escape\r\nfrom the humdrum heartbreak of Weimar Germany. Much of the book is\r\ndevoted to the problem of power--street-fighting, mass demonstrations,\r\nslogans, symbolisms--which so fascinated the Nazis.\r\n\r\n[25] See Carl J. Friedrich, _The New Belief in the Common Man_,\r\nBrattleboro (Vermont), 1945, chapter III, \"Independence of Thought and\r\nPropaganda,\" pp. 81-120, for a cogent discussion of this mentality. The\r\npresent author, in _Government in Republican China_, New York, 1938, pp.\r\n18-23, describes in epitome the method whereby the ancient Confucian\r\nleadership of China, while propaganda-conscious, used ideology as an\r\neconomical, stable method of control and avoided its maleficent\r\nfeatures. In one of the few poorly argued passages of a great work,\r\nArnold J. Toynbee overlooks this peculiar characteristic of Confucianism\r\nand merely equates the Confucian dogma with those of other \"universal\r\nchurches\" (_A Study of History_, London, 1939, vol. V, especially pages\r\n654-5).\r\n\r\n[26] People's Commissariat of Justice of the U.S.S.R., _Report of Court\r\nProceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet Trotzkyite Centre ...,\r\nVerbatim Report_, Moscow, 1937, page 111. These trials were themselves\r\npropaganda; in this particular instance, propaganda of a rather poor\r\norder, since they failed to convince the foreign public and presumably\r\npersuaded only those portions of the Russian public who were so gullible\r\nthat they needed no further persuading. For a brilliant illumination of\r\nthem in terms of a readable novel, see Arthur Koestler, _Darkness at\r\nNoon_, New York, 1941; the same author also has a book of essays on the\r\ntotalitarian mentality under the rather fancy title, _The Yogi and the\r\nCommissar_, New York, 1945. On the same subject, see Louis Fischer's\r\n_Men and Politics_, New York, 1942.\r\n\r\n[27] This document establishing the COI, along with the other major\r\ndocuments pertaining to American psychological warfare, may be found in\r\nJ. P. Warburg's book cited above, _Unwritten Treaty_.\r\n\r\n[28] In the course of a routine day of work on overseas propaganda in\r\n1942, the author, who was then in SSG of MIS, found it necessary to get\r\nin touch with Military Intelligence proper, Naval Intelligence, the\r\nState Department, the office of the Assistant to the President, the\r\nOffice of Facts and Figures, the British Political Warfare group (which\r\nwas vainly seeking its American opposite number), the Office of Civilian\r\nDefense, the Research and Analysis Branch of the office of the\r\nCoordinator of Information, the office of the Librarian of Congress, the\r\nForeign Information Service, and the Department of Agriculture. Each of\r\nthese either operated propaganda, or had policy or intelligence\r\ncontributions to make. The Board of Economic Warfare naturally came into\r\nthe field too. This was during a period of German and Japanese\r\nvictories, so that even if propaganda had been coordinated, it probably\r\nwould not have been much more effective than it was. From what could be\r\nfigured out later, no real harm was done at this time. Nor was much\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n[29] The bibliographies are cited above, on page 38. The journal comes\r\nout, as its title indicates, four times a year; it is published by the\r\nSchool of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University,\r\nPrinceton, N. J. Every major library has it. The review section provides\r\na good survey of new writing in the field. Journals such as _The\r\nAmerican Political Science Review_, _The Annals of the American Academy\r\nof Political and Social Science_, _The Infantry Journal_, and _The\r\nAmerican Historical Review_ often have significant articles or book\r\nreviews in this field. _International Affairs_ (Royal Institute for\r\nInternational Affairs, London) has excellent reviews of books arranged\r\nby geographic subheads. Opinion and propaganda topics are usually lumped\r\ntogether in academic studies; material on the one is apt to lead to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[30] San Tzu Ching, translated and annotated by Herbert A. Giles,\r\nShanghai, 1910, pages 2 and 3. The translation quoted is not by Giles.\r\n\r\n[31] On the transmitting side, nothing could be more ruinous than mere\r\ntranslation, the more literal the worse, of a single basic broadcast for\r\nall audiences irrespective of language or culture. For the text of war\r\ncommuniqués or of official documents, this is permissible, but for news\r\nor feature broadcasts, few things could be worse. It is not possible to\r\ntranslate subtle psychological appeals embedded in news or commentary;\r\nsuch materials by their nature must follow forms acceptable to the\r\naudience, building up confidence with familiar allusions and creating a\r\nsense of \"we-ness\" between the actual announcer and his listeners.\r\nEquivalents can be worked out. The same basic policies can be\r\ntransposed. The same source of news and intelligence can be exploited.\r\nBut the actual program cannot be translated verbatim from one language\r\nto another; it must be transposed not only from one language but from\r\none culture to another.\r\n\r\n[32] Free advertisement.\r\n\r\n[33] Bad news about his side is not necessarily the only kind of bad\r\nnews for the enemy to know. Gloomy news about our side can harm the\r\nenemy listener if his government is running a propaganda campaign to\r\nraise production, promote thrift, etc., by claiming things are worse on\r\n_their_ side. In such a case, good news about us would be good for him.\r\nNews must be fitted to the propaganda plan and to the propaganda\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n[34] Walter Lippmann's book, _Public Opinion_, was first published in\r\nNew York in 1922 but it is still clean-cut as a basic statement of the\r\nproblems of public opinion. The author's own life as a commentator is\r\nremarkable in fulfilling the mission which he implicitly set himself\r\nwhen writing about public opinion: the job of lifting issues into\r\nemotional and psychological contexts in which the resulting judgment\r\nwill be based on socially sound factors.\r\n\r\n[35] The American newspapers between 1942 and 1945 carried intermittent\r\naccounts of these personal and political problems, frequently in the\r\ncolumns of commentators rather than in the regular news sections. (The\r\nbook by Warburg is of course _Unwritten Treaty_, mentioned above.)\r\n\r\n[36] For popular histories of the OSS, see _Sub Rosa: The O.S.S. and\r\nAmerican Espionage_ by Stewart Alsop and Thomas Braden (New York, 1946)\r\nor Corey Ford and Alastair MacBain, _Cloak and Dagger_ (New York 1946).\r\nAn exciting thriller novel by Darwin Teilhet gives an oblique and\r\nguarded description of black propaganda and clandestine polling: _The\r\nFear Makers_ (New York, 1945); Teilhet was himself in OSS. For an\r\ninteresting description of OSS field operations, see Nicol Smith's _Into\r\nSiam_ (New York, 1946). OSS was picturesque from the very start, and it\r\nis likely that other participants in OSS work will from time to time\r\nbring out books on their adventures.\r\n\r\n[37] Bureau of the Budget, _United states Government Manual, 1946, First\r\nEdition_, Washington, 1946, says of the Military Intelligence Division,\r\n\"It has charge of propaganda and psychological warfare\" (page 198). The\r\nfiat may be a little more precise than circumstances warrant, but it at\r\nleast shows where, for the record, psychological warfare belonged.\r\n\r\n[38] See Charles E. Merriam's study, _Political Power_, Chicago, 1933,\r\nand his later works for suggestive approaches to the political setting\r\nof propaganda problems. He developed the terms miranda and credenda for\r\nmodern political science usage.\r\n\r\n[39] While this statement is plainly a matter of individual opinion, the\r\nauthor considers that his own experience supports his opinion in this\r\ninstance. He wrote plans on almost every operating level in the\r\ngovernmental and military hierarchy during World War II, all the way\r\nfrom drafting plans for the Joint (American) and Combined\r\n(British-American) Chiefs of Staff down to helping field agents in the\r\nChina Theater work out practical little propaganda plans for their own\r\nmissions, or planning the writing, use, and classification of leaflets\r\none by one, in collaboration with OWI operators. He found planning to be\r\nfascinating at the top, and worthwhile at the bottom of the pyramid, but\r\nhe found no significant correlation between the top and the bottom, save\r\nin the sense which he makes plain.\r\n\r\n[40] In the pseudo-technical propaganda slang of the OWI people, this\r\nwas called \"spelling out.\" The same people \"stockpiled\" \"campaigns\" to\r\n\"needle\" the enemy.\r\n\r\n[41] So far as he knows, the author was the first--about May of 1942--to\r\nurge that a surrender pass be made to look like an official document,\r\nwith banknote-type engraving and with formal style. Unfortunately, it\r\nwas printed in green, instead of the old-fashioned orange-gold of the\r\nU.S. Treasury yellowbacks, and was sent to the jungle areas of the South\r\nand Southwest Pacific, where everything was green to start with.\r\n\r\n[42] These suggestions are based on the comment of Major Martin Herz,\r\nwho prepared the leaflets at Anzio beachhead and subsequently was\r\nleaflet expert at SHAEF.\r\n\r\n[43] No author, publisher, place or date. Issued by the unit. The\r\nreference is to page 55.\r\n\r\n[44] The Department of the Army is understood to be preparing a Field\r\nManual and Technical Manual for Psychological Warfare which will\r\ndescribe the doctrines and the equipment, respectively, to be used in\r\ncombat propaganda situations.\r\n\r\n[45] In the postwar period a great many reflective publications began to\r\nappraise what had happened in the PsyWar field. One of the best of these\r\nis Daniel Lerner's _Sykewar: Psychological Warfare Against Germany,\r\nD-Day to VE-Day_ (New York, 1949), which covers the European operation\r\nin detail. This was followed by _Propaganda in War and Crisis_, edited\r\nby Daniel Lerner (New York, 1951). A heavier work, covering many of the\r\nsame problems is _The Language of Politics_, by Harold D. Lasswell,\r\nNathan Leites and associates (New York, 1949). Leonard Doob's work on\r\npropaganda, long the leading American text in the field, was issued in a\r\nrevised, postwar edition (New York, 1948); the postwar book does much to\r\nput \"psychological warfare\" in perspective. A simpler text than Doob's,\r\nuseful for less advanced students, is Frederick C. Irion's _Public\r\nOpinion and Propaganda_ (New York, 1950). A manual directly pertaining\r\nto psychological warfare is _America's Weapons of Psychological Warfare_\r\nedited by Robert E. Summers (New York, 1951); this also contains a\r\nbibliography which is helpful to the layman. Three outstanding works\r\nsummarize the postwar propaganda position of the U.S. Government:\r\nCharles A. H. Thomson's _Overseas Information Service of the United\r\nStates Government_ (Washington, 1950) shows the continuity of the\r\nproblem from war to peace; Wallace Carroll's _Persuade or Perish_\r\n(Boston, 1948) argues the necessity of maintaining an opinion offensive;\r\nand Edward Barrett's illuminating discussion, _Truth is Our Weapon_ (New\r\nYork, 1953), brings the story down to the Eisenhower Administration.\r\n\r\n[46] New insights into the nature of the Soviet antagonist were\r\npresented by three related monographs originally prepared inside RAND\r\nCorporation, the research facility which often works with the U.S. Air\r\nForce. Nathan Leites, _The Operational Code of the Politburo_ (New York,\r\n1951), digests Soviet fundamentals of international behavior. Margaret\r\nMead's _Soviet Attitudes Toward Authority_ (New York, 1951) applies\r\nanthropological and psychiatric methods of analysis; this book, to the\r\nmilitary or general reader, should be prefaced by reading her\r\ndistinguished work, _Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies_,\r\nwhich is now available in an inexpensive, paper-bound reprint (Mentor\r\nBooks, New York, 1952). Philip Selznick makes the point that\r\norganization is itself a Communist power-achieving instrument in his\r\n_The Organizational Weapon_ (New York, 1952), the third of the RAND\r\ngroup. Lt. Col. William R. Kintner, a Regular Army officer, prepared the\r\nchallenging study of the specific military content of Communist thinking\r\nin _The Front is Everywhere_ (Norman, Oklahoma, 1950). Among the many\r\ngood recent books about the Communist challenge, R.N. Carew Hunt, _The\r\nTheory and Practice of Communism_ (New York, 1951), is outstanding for\r\nits dispassionateness while James Burnham's _The Coming Defeat of\r\nCommunism_ (New York, 1951) is a ringing appeal to our side to meet the\r\nchallenge. Stefan T. Possony, in _A Century of Conflict_ (Chicago,\r\n1953), presents the most coldly damning and most far-ranging critique of\r\nCommunist operations which this writer has seen. Willmoore Kendall\r\nrendered Americans a service with his careful translation, editing and\r\nintroduction of A. Rossi, _A Communist Party in Action_ (New Haven,\r\n1949), while Bob Darke, in a British counterpart, gives a less\r\nintellectual and much abbreviated description of the British Communist\r\nset-up and operations in _The Communist Technique in Britain_ (London,\r\n1952). Communist revelations of \"capitalist\" conspiracies which tell\r\nmore about the haunted, anxious, nasty minds of the Communists than\r\nabout our own operations are, among others, L. Natarajan, _American\r\nShadow Over India_ (Bombay, 1952), and Jean Cathala, _They are Betraying\r\nPeace_ (Moscow, 1951).\r\n\r\n[47] Paul M. A. Linebarger, \"Communism as a Competing Civilization in\r\nSoutheast Asia,\" a contribution to _Southeast Asia in the Coming World_,\r\nPhilip W. Thayer, editor (Baltimore, 1952).\r\n\r\n[48] For a contrary point of view, see the works by Harry Stack\r\nSullivan, Brock Chisholm, and others.\r\n\r\n[49] Problematical in all such attempts of working officers to define\r\n\"victory\" is the serious intellectual issue of avoiding means which by\r\nthemselves defeat the ends which are sought. If the means are\r\n\"dangerous\" or \"immoral\" by the standards of the society which applies\r\nthem, their value becomes low indeed. For the covert side of U.S.\r\noperations, see the breezy and popular volumes on OSS: Lt. Col. Corey\r\nFord and Major Alastair MacBain, _Cloak and Dagger: The Secret Story of\r\nOSS_ (New York, 1946); Stewart Alsop and Thomas Braden, _Sub Rosa: The\r\nOSS and American Espionage_ (New York, 1946); and the most vividly\r\nconcrete narration of the group, Elizabeth P. MacDonald, _Undercover\r\nGirl_ (New York, 1947). For an astonishing work which seems to violate\r\nsecurity on every page, see Commander Roy Olin Stratton, _SACO--The Rice\r\nPaddy Navy_ (Pleasantville, N. Y., 1950); this is the description of a\r\nNavy group in China which the author shows to be more covert than OSS\r\nitself. A dry, German view of Anglo-American espionage in Holland is\r\ngiven in that superb, true-life adventure story, H. J. Giskes, _London\r\nCalling North Pole_ (London and New York, 1953).\r\n\r\n[50] See the works of Freda Utley, Herbert Feis, the\r\nLinebarger-Djang-Burks political science text (New York, 1954), and\r\nothers, not to mention the contributions by Mao, Liu Shao-ch'i, and\r\nother Communist leaders.\r\n\r\n[51] The author himself pleads guilty to having criticized the French\r\nunduly without accepting a reasonable share of U.S. responsibility for\r\nthe situation in Indochina (Paul M. A. Linebarger, \"Indochina: The\r\nBleeding War,\" _Combat Forces Journal_, March 1951), and was deservedly\r\nrebuked from some French readers for his denigration of French\r\nimperialism. The author cannot endorse as wise, shrewd, or kind the\r\nFrench political decisions in Indochina, hut he can say that the\r\nAmericans who made (or failed to make) basic policy concerning that area\r\nhave been as irresponsible and foolish as the French. He trusts that, by\r\nthe time this note reaches print, a more effectual Franco-American\r\nunderstanding will have replaced the previous difficulties.\r\n\r\n[52] Psychological warfare is, of course, neither very psychological nor\r\nis it necessarily warfare. Indeed, within the context of a rigidly\r\npurist and scholastic definition, psychological warfare is not\r\npsychological, in that most of its operations are very definitely _not_\r\na part of present-day scientific psychology. Neither is it _warfare_\r\nbecause it can be operated before war, during war, after war, or\r\ncontemporaneously with and apart from war. As pointed out above, war\r\ninvolves the inescapable content of public lawful _violence_. It is hard\r\nto ascribe violence to a short-wave broadcast or to a leaflet. In Korea\r\nin 1951 the author heard that a Chinese soldier was found dead--mashed\r\nby a leaflet bomb which had failed to explode at the proper altitude. If\r\nthis story is true, that particular soldier was one of the few genuine\r\n_war_ victims of military or strategic propaganda both so pretentiously\r\ncalled \"psychological warfare\" by Americans of the mid-twentieth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAnthony Leviero, who summarized American PsyWar in _The New York Times_\r\nin a series of articles between 9 December and 14 December 1951, is both\r\nan experienced general staff officer and a first-class newspaper man.\r\nHis comment in 1953 on the new Operations Coordinating Board was\r\nencouraging or ominous. He stated in his _Times_ dispatch of 4 September\r\n1953 that the William Jackson committee had found that \"psychological\r\nwarfare did not exist as such.\" If this meant that the new OCB was to\r\nsweep aside the limitations of top-secret pedantic definitions and move\r\ntoward a refreshingly concrete manipulation of the world scene, the news\r\nwas encouraging indeed. If the new Board was, however, to be dedicated\r\nto the manufacture of new, complicated and secret definitions of its\r\nown, the news was bad. Given the time-lag on the declassification of\r\nGovernment materials, it may be twenty-five years, or 1978, before the\r\nprecise definitions of 1953 are available to the public. The tendency of\r\nthe Board to succeed or to fail will be evident by the time this\r\nmaterial is in print; given the personalities involved, the prognosis\r\nappeared optimistic.\r\n\r\n[53] This kind of issue has not been neglected in our public discussions\r\nor our schools. Two sides of one famous case are given in Owen\r\nLattimore, _Ordeal by Slander_ (New York, 1951) and the bitterly\r\nanti-Lattimore book by John T. Flynn, _The Lattimore Story_ (New York,\r\n1953). A serious intelligent attempt to answer some of the problems\r\nposed by PsyWar and the resulting loyalty issues within a democracy are\r\nthe works of Nathaniel Weyl, _Treason: The Story of Disloyalty and\r\nBetrayal in American History_ (Washington, 1950), and _The Battle\r\nAgainst Disloyalty_ (New York, 1951). A formidable presentation of what\r\nthe Communists are doing is offered in Ralph de Toledano, _Spies, Dupes,\r\nand Diplomats_ (New York and Boston, 1952) and in Major General Charles\r\nA. Willoughby, _Shanghai Conspiracy_ (New York, 1952). The kind of\r\nround-table often intellectually conceived and executed within American\r\nschools is well portrayed in the special issue of _Columbia Journal of\r\nInternational Affairs_ (New York, spring, 1951), in which the entire\r\nissue is given to a synthesis of international problems in the\r\npropaganda field under the heading \"Propaganda and World Politics.\"\r\nStefan Possony's magistral _A Century of Conflict_ (Chicago, 1953)\r\nprovides an excellent general framework.\r\n\r\n[54] Nothing in previous U.S. experience prepared Americans for the\r\ninvasion of the individual personality which has long been accomplished\r\nby the Communists but which was first publicized in adequate fashion\r\nafter the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950. The pioneer book in this\r\nfield, and still the best, is Edward Hunter's _Brain-Washing in Red\r\nChina_ (New York, 1951). This author has known Mr. Hunter for twenty-odd\r\nyears and can vouch for him as a man with a sober respect for fact,\r\nthough he does have a vivid taste in adjectives; he has seen not only\r\nMr. Hunter but has gone over some of the raw material which Hunter used\r\nand can testify to the reality and sympathy with which Hunter portrays\r\nthis rather gruesome process. On a different scale, Wilbur Schramm has\r\ngiven a description of what happens when _The Reds Take a City_ (New\r\nBrunswick, 1951), in a book of that name written jointly with John W.\r\nRiley.\r\n\r\n[55] A sharp contrast between the old politics and the new is shown by\r\nthe unfortunate book prepared in the Department of State and now\r\nhastily, even guiltily, allowed to go out of print by the United States\r\nGovernment Printing Office because it showed that some Americans were\r\nguilty or naïve enough to try to love and trust the Soviet state within\r\nthe same system as our own. One does not know whether to laugh or to\r\nweep at the spectacle of men lamenting the fact that they were once\r\ninnocent and hopeful. The book, prepared by the late Harley Notter and\r\nothers, is Department of State Publication 3580, General Policy Series\r\n15, _Postwar Foreign Policy Preparation_ (Washington, 1949). That not\r\nall was innocence, even when things so seemed, is amply attested by\r\nFreda Utley's controversial but brilliant summary, _The China Story_\r\n(Chicago, 1951).\r\n\r\n[56] The function of decision-making has been brilliantly though\r\nsolemnly explored in Richard C. Snyder, H. W. Bruck and Burton Sapin,\r\n_Decision-making as an Approach to the Study of International Politics_\r\n(Princeton, N.J., 1954.)\r\n\r\n[57] For a contrary point of view, see _Tensions That Lead to War_,\r\nedited by Hadley Cantril (Princeton, 1950).\r\n\r\n[58] The author had the opportunity of observing opsearch in the Korean\r\nwar on three different occasions: September 1950, March 1951, and\r\nNovember and December 1952 and early January 1953. He visited Korea\r\nitself twice and also spent a great deal of time, part of it in a public\r\ncapacity and part of it as a free-lance author, in the periphery of that\r\nwar--areas such as Hong Kong, Indochina, Thailand, the Philippines,\r\nMalaya, Burma, Indonesia, and India.\r\n\r\n[59] Several novels have touched on PsyWar problems. The most\r\nhard-hitting of the lot is Jerome Weidman, _Too Early to Tell_ (New\r\nYork, 1946). Covert PsyWar whispering techniques are thinly disguised\r\nand much improved, technically, in Darwin Teilhet, _The Fear Makers_\r\n(New York, various dates). The covert side of some of these adventures\r\nis portrayed, among others, by W. Stanley Moss, _A War of Shadows_ (New\r\nYork, 1952); Ray Franklin Kauffman, _The Coconut Wireless_ (New York,\r\n1948); and Chin Kee Onn, _Silent Army_ (New York, 1953). As exciting as\r\nfiction are Mark Gayn and John Caldwell, _American Agent_ (New York,\r\n1947), describing the work of an enthusiastic amateur, and L. C.\r\nMoyzisch, _Operation Cicero_ (New York reprint, 1952), portraying a\r\nfirst-class professional. Alexander Foote, _Handbook for Spies_ (London,\r\n1949), and J. V. Davidson-Houston, _Armed Pilgrimage_ (London 1949), are\r\ninteresting distillations of personal experience which touch on\r\nespionage and PsyWar.\r\n\r\n[60] The author professes he would like to write a preliminary work on\r\nthis subject himself some day, if no one else essays the task first.\r\n\r\n[61] V = Victory day.\r\n\r\n[62] Edward Hunter, _Brain-Washing in Red China_ (New York, 1951).\r\n\r\n[63] If one good book can be mentioned without prejudice to the many\r\nother good books in the same field, attention can be drawn to the\r\nexcellent undergraduate text which explores the present U.S. position on\r\nthe press, George I. Bird and Frederic E. Merwin, _The Press and\r\nSociety_ (New York, 1951). At the opposite end of the spectrum, see Oleg\r\nAnesimov, _The Ultimate Weapon_ (New York, 1953). The first book takes\r\nthe U.S. as it is and does not envisage profound responses coming as the\r\ninevitable accompaniment of frightful change; the second book states the\r\noutside problem in shocking terms, but asks of Americans things which\r\nneither they nor their press are ever apt to approve.\r\n\r\n[64] The development of this activity was handed to the Chief of Army\r\nField Forces, in whose G2 section Colonel Donald Hall was the PsyWar\r\nofficer. The first of these courses with its supporting textbook was not\r\nready for release by the Army General School until 1949, just one year\r\nbefore the Korean conflict began. In 1949 likewise appeared the first\r\nofficially approved Army field manual on the subject of psychological\r\nwarfare support of military operations.\r\n\r\n[65] Teams from this detachment, armed with leaflets and loudspeakers,\r\nwere sent to and participated in major maneuvers in continental United\r\nStates, in the Caribbean area, and in Hawaii. These teams were attached\r\nto the \"enemy\" forces, and exposed the maneuver troops to military\r\npropaganda in action. The Tactical Information Detachment suddenly\r\nsuspended its planning of simulated propaganda operations for Exercise\r\nPluto in 1950. As the only PsyWar operational unit in the Army, the\r\nDetachment was hustled off to Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbeville, 164\r\n\r\n  Adams, Samuel, 23\r\n\r\n  Adipadi, 185\r\n\r\n  Aggression, timing, 43\r\n\r\n  Aims, long-range, 126\r\n\r\n  Air dropping, 229\r\n\r\n  Air rescue, 142, 231\r\n\r\n  Air support, 228\r\n\r\n  Aircraft, World War I, 69\r\n\r\n  Allen, George, 271\r\n\r\n  Alsop, Joseph, 273\r\n\r\n  Alsop, Stewart, 182\r\n\r\n  American Association of Public Opinion Research, 290\r\n\r\n  American Broadcasting Station in Europe, 270, 288\r\n\r\n  American Expeditionary Forces, 67. _See also_ Pershing's headquarters\r\n\r\n  American operations, effects, 103\r\n\r\n  American policy in Indochina, 260-262\r\n\r\n  American Revolution, 21\r\n    black leaflet, 20\r\n\r\n  American-Russian meeting, 202\r\n\r\n  Andersen, Hans Christian, 156\r\n\r\n  Anger motif, 233\r\n\r\n  Annamites, 263\r\n\r\n  Announcers, radio, 58\r\n\r\n  Anti-Communist appeals, 246\r\n\r\n  Anti-Semitic propaganda, 138\r\n\r\n  Anzio, 82, 212, 239\r\n\r\n  Appeals, black action, 237\r\n\r\n  Armed Forces Radio Service, 272\r\n\r\n  Armed Forces Radio Stations, 34\r\n\r\n  Army Air Forces, 183\r\n\r\n  Army Forces, Far East, 305\r\n\r\n  Army General School, 304\r\n\r\n  Aryan myth, 78\r\n\r\n  Aryan racialism, 25\r\n\r\n  Asia, Communism in, 251\r\n\r\n  Athenians, 7\r\n\r\n  Atrocities, 46, 79\r\n\r\n  Attu, 214\r\n\r\n  Audience, 123\r\n\r\n  Austria, 184\r\n\r\n  _Azad Hind_, 185\r\n\r\n  _Azad Hind Fauj_, 8\r\n\r\n  Aztecs, 17\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bakunin, Mikhail, 297\r\n\r\n  Balkan states, 163\r\n\r\n  Balloons, 21, 69\r\n\r\n  Barrett, Edward W., 271\r\n\r\n  Bataan, 223\r\n\r\n  Beaverbrook, Lord, 64\r\n\r\n  Belgium, 13\r\n\r\n  Belly tank, 170\r\n\r\n  Benedict, Ruth, 3\r\n\r\n  Bengal, 8\r\n\r\n  Benton, William, 184, 271\r\n\r\n  Black counterpropaganda, 148\r\n\r\n  Black, Lt.
