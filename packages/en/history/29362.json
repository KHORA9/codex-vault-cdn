It is an attempt to say to the general public a few\r\nthings about this amazing work of Dr. J. R. Brinkley, of Milford,\r\nKansas, which he is debarred from saying for himself in this simple\r\nform. He has under consideration a book of his own covering the subject\r\nof Goat-Gland Transplantation, his experiments, successes, failures,\r\ntheories, and conclusions, which will probably be issued during the\r\nwinter of 1922, and in that book he expects to treat his subject\r\nexhaustively with full medical and surgical detail, in a manner\r\nacceptable to the medical profession. But, in the meantime, no\r\nsatisfactory effort has been made to tell the story to the general\r\npublic, except in the fragmentary form of occasional newspaper notices.\r\nThe author feels that the chief interest in this matter abides with the\r\npatient rather than with the practitioner, or, if not the chief\r\ninterest, at least an equal interest. It seems proper, therefore, that\r\nthe subject should be briefly dealt with at this time, while it is yet\r\nin its infancy, in such a manner that the general public may grasp the\r\nessentials of what is being done in America in this new application of\r\nendocrinology. Some attention is paid to the pioneer work of Dr. Frank\r\nLydston of Chicago in the transplanting of human glands into human\r\nbeings, but rather by way of emphasizing the fact that Dr. Brinkley,\r\nwith the choice of human, monkey, goat, or sheep glands before him,\r\nchose the goat-glands in preference to any other for his field of\r\nexperiment and operation, and has never for a moment regretted his\r\nchoice, or seen any reason to alter it.\r\n\r\nWithout any wish to enter upon a controversy, the author is impelled to\r\ntake some notice of the statement of Dr. Serge Voronoff of Paris, who,\r\nduring his recent visit to the United States, announced that he pinned\r\nhis faith almost exclusively to the glands of the anthropoid apes as\r\nmost suitable for transplantation into human beings, while he lamented\r\nthe natural scarcity of obtainable material. Dr. Voronoff is credited\r\nwith having performed over 150 transplantations upon rams, but none\r\nwhatever of goat-glands upon human beings, and not more than two or\r\nthree of simian glands upon human beings. His statement, therefore, that\r\nsuccessful transplantation of the glands of the goat into a human being\r\nis \"impossible, and cannot succeed,\" is empirical, and entirely\r\nunsupported by any experience of his own in the matter. Against it, and\r\ncompletely confuting it, we set the clear conclusions of Dr. Brinkley,\r\nbacked by his unequalled record of over 600 successful transplants of\r\ngoat-glands into men and women, during the past three years. Since there\r\nis no other human being who has had experience sufficient in this matter\r\nupon which he may justly found an opinion, it seems to the author that\r\nonly one man, Dr. Brinkley himself, is qualified to speak at all, and\r\nuntil members of the medical profession here and in Europe have mastered\r\nDr. Brinkley's technique, and learned what to do, and how and why, and\r\nwhat not to do, and why not, a dogmatic negative is not the proper\r\ncomment with regard to the question of whether successful\r\ntransplantation of goat-glands can be made upon human beings. If, after\r\nlearning what Dr. Brinkley has learned by laborious experiments,\r\ncontinued for years, they find that their conclusions differ from his,\r\nthey will at least have earned the right to speak. But it is\r\nunreasonable to suppose, in that event, that their conclusions would in\r\nany way or degree differ from Dr. Brinkley's conclusion that, in brief,\r\nthe implanting of the glands of the young goat into men and women is an\r\nactual triumph of modern surgery and medical skill, which has resulted,\r\nin hundreds of cases, clearly recorded, and filed for reference, in\r\nrejuvenating both men and women; removing impotence from old men; curing\r\narterio-sclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, in every case treated;\r\ncuring five cases of Dementia Praecox out of a total of five cases\r\ntreated; curing six cases of Locomotor Ataxia out of six cases treated;\r\ncuring two cases of Paralysis Agitans out of two cases treated;\r\nrestoring normal conditions in one hundred cases of Psychopathia\r\nSexualis; bringing about the parenthood of barren women and impotent men\r\nnot yet past middle-age; restoring the function of menstruation or\r\nregular periodicity to women who have passed through the change of life;\r\nand, in a word, making good in the cure of so-called incurables, and\r\ndoing something that was never done before, to our knowledge, in the\r\nhistory of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is not the intention in this little book to follow Dr. Brinkley in\r\nexact detail through his amazing list of cases of all manner of diseases\r\ncured by this treatment. His files are open to the profession at all\r\ntimes, and the records may be consulted by the earnest investigator at\r\nthe hospital at Milford, Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe intention in this little book is to cover particularly that phase of\r\nhuman longing which asks that the clock be turned back, and that old age\r\nbe deferred.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact beyond all gainsaying that Dr. Brinkley's operation has in\r\ntruth cheated old age of its toll in very many cases of both sexes, and\r\nthe improvement, or rejuvenation, affects both the minds and bodies of\r\nthose treated by this method; and this rejuvenation is lasting to the\r\nextent of the doctor's observation. It would be presuming to say that it\r\nis a permanent improvement. Upon that point no one has any right to\r\noffer an opinion, because there are no facts upon which to found it. But\r\nDr. Brinkley's earliest cases, operated upon three years ago, up to the\r\npresent time have shown no diminution whatever in the good effects\r\nsecured. Neither the women nor the men have lost any particle of their\r\nincreased vitality during this lapse of time. Who can say how long the\r\ngood effects will continue? Dr. Brinkley's opinion is that the\r\nimprovement will run for possibly fifteen years, at the end of which\r\ntime he expects to re-operate upon any cases that show a slowing-down in\r\nthe life-processes, and believes that the introduction of two new glands\r\nafter that time will result in a return of the vitality in full force as\r\nbefore. That is his guess of the probable duration of the improvement,\r\nbut it is quite possible that his estimate errs on the side of\r\nconservatism. There is one assuring and comforting fact, however,\r\nbearing on this point, which should be carefully noted here, namely,\r\nwhen a retransplantation was made by Dr. Brinkley upon a goat which had\r\nfirst been cured of old age by transplantation of new glands, which was\r\nallowed to retain this new adolescence for a year, and was then deprived\r\nof the glands, causing a speedy return to the miserable condition of old\r\nage and its ills, and which was then re-operated upon and given two new\r\nglands, the instant improvement was every whit as noticeable and as\r\nperfect in this second implantation as in the first. Now it is a\r\nreasonable inference from this clear-cut result that Dr. Brinkley is\r\nright in his opinion that a second transplantation of the goat-glands\r\ninto a human being after a lapse of years, when the first implant may be\r\nexpected to have worn itself thin, will result in the same improvement\r\nin the physical and mental condition of either man or woman as took\r\nplace upon the first implant. This is, in fact, the basis of his theory\r\nthat the normal age of man and woman today can be surely extended from\r\nthe three score and ten limit to possibly twice that number of years.\r\nYou are invited to consider what this discovery of Dr. Brinkley's\r\noperation, for it is no less than a discovery, would have meant to the\r\nworld in the prolongation of the lives of those benefactors in all\r\nfields of human endeavor, Literature, Science, Art, etc., if it had been\r\nknown and understood when Shakespeare wrote, when Darwin worked, when\r\nRubens painted, and when Patti sang. It will please your fancy to\r\npicture what might have been, but we have before us the consideration of\r\nwhat is, and it is more than comforting to know that we shall deal here\r\nwith the hard cold facts of what is being done today, and will be done\r\ntomorrow. This is no poet's dream, but the stern reality of a young\r\nsurgeon's work in hospital, extending over three memorable years of\r\nachievement in a virgin field. Dr. Brinkley has worked out his problem\r\nalone, save for the devoted aid of his wife, who is also a licensed\r\nphysician. He is today a poor man, and expects to remain so, because he\r\nhas refused every alluring offer made him looking to the establishment\r\nof this Goat-Gland operation as a commercial proposition on a big scale.\r\nHe is governed by his ethical vows, and retains his independence, but\r\nthe world would call him a fool for not turning his discovery to his\r\ngreatest pecuniary profit. Since he prefers to remain true to his ideals\r\nin this matter it is for us at least to be thankful, and accord him the\r\nrecognition to which the scientist is entitled who puts his work above\r\nhis profits.\r\n\r\nChicago, April, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nDR. BRINKLEY'S THEORY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are not privileged to be discursive in a little book which seeks to\r\nhit the nail on the head in every paragraph, drive it home in every\r\npage, and clinch it in every chapter, and there would be no excuse,\r\ntherefore, for sketching, even in brief outline, the history of the\r\nvarious attempts that have been made, from Brown-Sequard, with his\r\nElixir, to Metchnikoff, with his benevolent bacteria of the intestinal\r\ntract, to extract from Life its secret of human longevity. It has been a\r\nlong quest, and, in the main, fruitless, though it might be said in\r\nfairness that Brown-Sequard's method of using the expressed testicular\r\njuice as a medicine, by mouth or injection, for the renewal of youth,\r\nwas probably the true parent of the present familiar method of using the\r\nextracts of various glands, or the pulverized substance of the glands\r\nthemselves, notably the thyroid and the adrenal, as medicines to be\r\ntaken internally for the relief of various diseased conditions. The\r\nconstant objection to such form of medication is, of course, that when\r\nthe medicine is stopped the good results stop, so that a temporary\r\nrelief is the utmost that can be hoped for from the method. Genius is\r\nsynthetic, elliptic, sudden, but always clear and sure. Dr. Brinkley\r\nbegan with a theory, and by no means a new theory. From the theory he\r\ndeduced rapidly, and acted. The results of the acts proved the truth of\r\nthe theory. That theory has been variously stated, its most familiar\r\nform being, \"In all living forms the basis of all energy is sex-energy.\"\r\n\r\nLooking about for facts to confirm or disprove this assertion all\r\ninvestigators have been faced with similar phenomena, such as:\r\n\r\nWhen the male fowl is sterilized in order that he may grow big and fat\r\nfor the market later he loses his cock's plumage and gains in weight. In\r\nthe psychic domain the changes are still more marked. The capon is a\r\ncoward, shunning the contest for supremacy. He does not forage for the\r\nhens, inviting them to feed upon what he has found, but looks after\r\nhimself first and last. He is lazy, sluggish, and selfish.\r\n\r\nThe stallion is a proud and beautiful animal, and Job's description of\r\nthe war-horse \"He paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength, He\r\ngoeth on to meet the armed men!\" with its context, is still the best\r\nword-painting we have of the majesty of the horse in full possession of\r\nhis sexual powers. The gelding is tractable and useful, and the absence\r\nof the fiery impatience of the stallion fits the gelding for man's use.\r\n\r\nWhen men are castrated, as in the East, in youth, where they are prized\r\nas custodians of the harem, they are fat, usually large of frame, but\r\nshort-lived. The growth of hair on the head is often scant; on the face\r\nand body it is altogether missing. The voice is high, partaking of a\r\ntreble quality. When through surgical operation or accident it happens\r\nthat a man is deprived of the testicular glands in youth, early manhood,\r\nor even middle-age, the same changes follow as in the case of the\r\neunuch, the hair on face and body disappears, the voice changes from\r\ndeep to high tone, and mentally the man develops inertia and cowardice.\r\nPhysically, he puts on fat almost immediately.\r\n\r\nWhen women have, for any reason, had their ovaries removed by surgical\r\noperation, marked changes follow, which vary much in detail, but carry\r\ncertain general similarities. The face and body age rapidly in\r\nappearance, and there is a slowing up of functions of the organs, with a\r\ntendency to masculinity in tastes, behavior, feelings.\r\n\r\nNoting these and many other phenomena, as many had done before him, Dr.\r\nBrinkley concluded that the testes of the male and the ovaries of the\r\nfemale performed corresponding offices for each sex, generating the\r\nvital fluids which, when not fulfilling their primary object of\r\nreproducing the species, were turned back into the blood and absorbed by\r\nthe tissues for the benefit of the individual's physical and mental\r\nprocesses. Normal activity of the secretions of the sex-glands,\r\ntherefore, meant, in Dr. Brinkley's opinion, right nourishment for all\r\nthe cells of the body, and right functioning of all the organs of the\r\nbody. The strength and speed of the stallion in health were as much due\r\nto the right action of the sex-glands as his full-arched neck, his\r\nblazing eye, or his thick mane and tail. And since the capon and the\r\neunuch acquired a cowardice that avoided fatigue, effort, or conflict,\r\nit was clear that the mental qualities were as directly influenced by\r\nthe testicular secretion as the physical. It followed that the\r\nwell-nourished brain, capable of sustained concentration and clear\r\nthinking, must necessarily be the brain that was fed by the normal\r\nactivity of the sex-glands, and it also followed that since youth in man\r\nand woman is the time of matured beauty of face and form in man and\r\nwoman, when sexual secretions are of normal activity, therefore, the\r\nsexual secretions were mainly responsible for the development of matured\r\nbeauty of face and form. From this it was clear and evident that the\r\nhaggard face, the lined face, the over-thin or the over-fat body,\r\nphemonena familiar to all of us in men and women who have passed their\r\nyouth, were due in the main to lack of nourishment of the body-cells by\r\nthe seminal fluid, with lack of proper functioning of the organs, and\r\nresultant lack of proper elimination of waste matter from the system,\r\nproducing that condition of slowing-down of the machine which is a part\r\nof the aging process of the body and mind of man and woman, as seen in\r\nall men and all women today.\r\n\r\nIt is important always that you realize that though we may seem to\r\nstress the physical improvement in human beings brought about by this\r\ngland-transplantation, the more important change of the two is the\r\nmental, and Dr. Brinkley's theory that ALL ENERGY IS SEX-ENERGY means\r\nexactly that the powerful brain equally with the beautiful face owes its\r\nstrength and vigor exactly to the right functioning of the sex-glands.\r\n\r\nWe must not be accused here of running to extravagance. It is not stated\r\nthat all human brains are of equal power or can be developed to equal\r\npower. It is stated that all human brains of unusual power are brains\r\nthat are well-nourished by the testicular secretions, and it is implied,\r\nwith full understanding of what this statement leads to, that if, for\r\nany reason, there is an interference with this sex-gland activity, the\r\nunusual brain will cease in a short time to be unusual in its power,\r\ngrasp, and faculty of clear, continuous thought. Similarly it is stated\r\nthat if this unusual brain, after losing its power of sustained\r\nthinking, is again fed by the renewed activities of the sex-glands, it\r\nwill re-establish its power, and the mind will display its former\r\nbrilliance.\r\n\r\nYou see how amazing and far-reaching is the application of this\r\napparently simple theory that sex-energy is the basis of all human\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nIt is, after all, only another way of saying that all things proceed\r\nfrom a common source, that Life is One, that Mind and Body derive from\r\nthe same source, that energy is so much an integral of matter, that in\r\nthe final analysis matter is only static energy; since the atom is made\r\nof molecules, and molecules of electrons, and electrons of electricity,\r\nor energy.\r\n\r\nIn saying, therefore, that sex-energy is at the basis of all human\r\nenergy we may quite possibly be trending towards a solution of the\r\nworld-old question of what Life itself is. Some day, without a doubt, we\r\nshall surprise this secret at its source. At present we are fortunate to\r\nhave discovered, through Dr. Brinkley's careful proving of his theory,\r\nthat human energy, no matter whether its manifestation be physical or\r\nmental, has a common base of supply, the sex-glands, and that their\r\nactivity determines a brilliant mentality, or a dull brain; a state of\r\nhealth, or a state of disease; beauty of form and feature and skin, or\r\nwrinkles, sallowness and ugliness. These appearances and qualities are\r\nphenomena which have the same source, or base. Many have felt this to be\r\ntrue. Dr. Brinkley alone has had the wit and skill to find the means to\r\nsolve the problem as it should be solved to be of any value to humanity,\r\nnamely, to discover how the inactivity can be changed to activity, how\r\nthe blood of man and woman can be charged anew with the life-giving\r\nhormones, perhaps, or whatever may be the name of that substance\r\nsecreted by the sex-glands and used by the blood to nourish all the\r\ncells of the body, which MUST be present in the system if body and mind\r\nare to continue to function at their best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. AND MRS. BRINKLEY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PRACTICE. MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Brinkley began his experiments in gland-transplanting upon animals\r\nin the year 1911, three years before the European War, using goats,\r\nsheep, and guinea-pigs as his subjects. He ran beyond the limits of his\r\nresources in this experimental work on animals, which was interrupted by\r\nhis enlistment in the army, and assignment to service as First\r\nLieutenant in the Medical Corps. Passed fit for Foreign Duty he was\r\nnevertheless unable to get across to France, and remained, like many\r\nanother good surgeon, on duty in various southern camps.\r\n\r\nReturning to civilian life he took up his quest again, varying a general\r\nmedical and surgical practice by continued observation and experiment in\r\ngland-transplantations upon animals, leaning ever more strongly towards\r\nthe exclusive use of goats. About this time he heard of the work of\r\nProfessor Steinach of Vienna in grafting the glands of rats, and\r\nproducing changes in the character and appearance of the animals by\r\ninverting the process of nature and transplanting male glands into\r\nfemales, and vice versa, sometimes with success. He had followed with\r\nthe greatest interest also the experiments of Dr. Frank Lydston of\r\nChicago, who performed his first human-gland transplantation upon\r\nhimself, an example of courage that falls not far short of heroism. But\r\nDr. Brinkley was never favorably impressed with the idea of using the\r\nglands of a human being for the renovation of the life-force of another\r\nhuman being. He was looking to the young of the animal kingdom to\r\nfurnish him with the material he proposed to use to improve the\r\nfunctioning of human organs, and more certainly as time passed he drew\r\nto the conclusion that in the goat, and in the goat alone, was to be\r\nfound that gland-tissue which, because of its rapid maturity, potency,\r\nand freedom from those diseases to which humanity is liable, was most\r\nsure under right conditions of implantation to feed, nourish, grow into\r\nand become a part of, human gland-tissue.\r\n\r\nLater we will dwell a little upon some of his results. It is worthy of\r\nnote in passing that his first experiment upon a human being was an\r\nunqualified success. He transplanted the goat-glands into a farmer who\r\nwas forty-six years of age, happily married, but childless, and one year\r\nafter the transplantation a child was born, who was christened \"Billy\"\r\nin honor of the circumstances responsible for his birth. By patient\r\nselection Dr. Brinkley has found that the Toggenburg breed of Swiss goat\r\ngives him the best possible stock to use in his gland-work. This choice\r\nwas forced upon him by results obtained by the use of other breeds. He\r\nfound that the Toggenburg goat gave him best results because the animal,\r\nbesides its sound health, carries none of that persistent odor which is\r\npeculiar to male goats the world over, and which, if shed abroad by a\r\nhuman being would make his neighborhood unpleasant. He found that the\r\nbest age of the male goats whose glands were to be transplanted was from\r\nthree weeks to a month. He found that the best age at which to use the\r\novaries of the female goat was one year, because, unlike its youthful\r\nbrother, the female goat's sex-activities are not developed before that\r\nage.\r\n\r\nHis method of transplanting the glands into a man is by making two\r\nincisions in the man's scrotum under simple local anesthesia,\r\na practically painless operation, but from this point on the technique\r\nvaries according to the conditions presented by the case. No two cases\r\nare exactly alike, and Dr. Brinkley performs no two operations exactly\r\nalike. That is the reason, he explains, why, with the best will in the\r\nworld to teach his fellow-practitioners what to do and how to do it, he\r\nis nevertheless unable to state in writing exactly what treatment to use\r\nto cover all cases. It cannot be taught by correspondence, and, simple\r\nthough it sounds to hear it, it cannot be learned by attendance at a few\r\nclinics. It is delicate in this sense, that if it is not rightly\r\nperformed in the individual case the glands will slough. That means loss\r\nof time, loss of temper, and the waste of a perfectly good pair of young\r\ngoat-glands. Another very important thing which his experiments have\r\ntaught Dr. Brinkley is this: the glands on being removed from the goat\r\nmust immediately be placed in a salt solution warmed to blood-heat, and\r\nthey must be used on the human being WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES from the time\r\nthey are taken from the goat. No such thing is possible as keeping these\r\nglands in the refrigerator for twenty-four hours, or anything of that\r\nkind, before using. The more quickly after removal from the animal they\r\nare used the more likely they are to take hold and grow. In his men\r\ncases he uses sometimes one gland, sometimes two; sometimes the whole\r\ngland, just as it came from the young goat, sometimes a part of the\r\ngland only, but he leans to the opinion that the gland of the\r\nthree-weeks-old goat gives best results if used entire, without\r\ntrimming. Sometimes he lays the gland +upon+ the outside of the human\r\ntestis, connecting part with part; sometimes he opens the testis by\r\nincision and lays the goat-gland within the cleft. Very often there are\r\nadhesions which must be broken down before the goat-gland can function\r\nrightly. Very often there are unsuspected hydroceles, forming cysts in\r\nthe testicular mass, which must be cut out, or there may be varicocele\r\nrequiring attention. The patient suffers very slight inconvenience; the\r\nlocal anesthetic is enough to dull the pain even of the breaking down of\r\nthe adhesions, so that it is at its worst no more than the pain of a\r\ntoothache, and lasts a very brief while. Many of the patients converse\r\nwith the doctor while the operation is proceeding. The pain is\r\nnegligible. The doctor proceeds according to the condition, age, etc.,\r\nof his patient. He may ligate, that is to say, tie off, the tubes that\r\nconnect with one testis, or the other, or both; he may not ligate at\r\nall. It will depend upon the result sought, the condition present, and\r\nthe age of the patient. Suppose the patient is an old man in whom it is\r\ndesired to produce rejuvenation; the doctor then will ligate both sides,\r\nin order that the new glands when they take hold, and begin to feed the\r\ntestes of the man, stimulating these to a new activity, may not be\r\novertaxed to the point of excess usage by the patient when he returns\r\nhome and finds himself in possession of a sexual vigor that has been\r\nunknown to him for many years. This increase in sexual vigor\r\n+invariably+ follows, regardless of the age of the patient. The glowing\r\nletters on file in the doctor's office attest this. Here, for instance,\r\nis a letter from a man eighty-one years of age, who says, \"I feel like a\r\nboy of eighteen. This is something I have not known for more than forty\r\nyears. The goat-glands have certainly done the work for me, but I wish,\r\ndoctor, you would fix it so that I could complete the sexual act,\" etc.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nBut this completion of the sexual act is exactly the thing that is to be\r\navoided in the case of these old men. Remember the theory in the last\r\nchapter, \"All animal energy is sex-energy.\" The conversion of this\r\nsex-energy into other forms of energy, physical and mental, is the aim,\r\nand this aim would be frustrated if these old men were given full power\r\nto do as they pleased with their new-found youthful vigor. You cannot\r\nalways trust them. That is the purpose of the ligating of both sides,\r\nmaking the emission of the semen impossible. The life-force, then,\r\nhaving no other outlet, can do nothing else but reinvigorate the entire\r\nsystem by pouring its precious fluids into the blood.\r\n\r\nSuppose, now, the case is that of a man of fifty who is physically run\r\ndown, married, and anxious to be the father of a child. In such a case,\r\nif the man is physically sound, Dr. Brinkley will do one of two things.\r\nAfter the transplantation of the new glands he will either ligate one\r\nside permanently, and allow one testis to carry on the work of\r\nrejuvenation while the other can be used for procreation, or he will\r\nligate both sides and say to the man, \"I am tying off both testes\r\nbecause you will need to rebuild for at least one year before you should\r\nthink of becoming a father. But I am ligating with linen thread, which\r\ndoes not dissolve, and if you come back to me in one year from now I\r\nwill remove the ligatures, one or both, and you will then be able to\r\nprocreate.\" This is reasonable and wise talk, and the man makes no\r\nobjection. When the year of probation, as you might call it, has\r\nexpired, the man returns to the hospital, the ligature is removed, and\r\nhe goes home in a couple of days. These things are not fairy-tales, but\r\nsolid facts, amazing as they sound to you. There are five goat-gland\r\nbabies today among Dr. Brinkley's patients that he knows of, four boys\r\nand one girl. There are probably many more of whom he has heard nothing,\r\nfor patients have a way of moving out of touch after awhile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE PRACTICE. WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Dr. Brinkley's hospital, a beautifully appointed private residence,\r\nit is a comfort to women patients to have the doctor's wife, herself a\r\ncompetent surgeon if necessary, at hand during the actual operation.\r\nMrs. Brinkley administers the local anesthetic, or the general\r\nanesthetic, if that is called for, as it sometimes is. While\r\nthe bulk of the operations performed on both men and women are\r\ngland-transplantations, a diseased condition of tubes and ovaries has\r\nsometimes made a laporotomy necessary, and many major operations have\r\nbeen successfully performed in the white-enameled operating room.\r\nAt such times a woman clings to the presence of a woman, and Mrs.\r\nBrinkley's kind and pleasant manner is usually sufficient to banish all\r\nnervousness from the woman patient.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary cases of gland-transplantation into women, where the patient\r\nis in good physical condition, with no disease of the organs, the\r\noperation is as simple as in the case of the man. The speculum discloses\r\nthe condition of the vagina, and the insertion of the new ovary is into\r\nthe mucous membrane of the vagina, leaving the goat-ovary about four\r\ninches distant from the woman's. The only incision made is a small one,\r\nabout one inch long, painless under local anesthetic, the purpose of the\r\nincision being to get a blood supply for the goat-ovary. Sometimes one\r\novary is implanted, sometimes two; invariably the new ovary is trimmed\r\nto a reduction in size. Invariably it is implanted within twenty minutes\r\nof its removal from the nanny-goat. Unfortunately for the goat, the\r\nremoval of her ovaries usually costs her her life. She mopes for a few\r\ndays, refuses to eat, and dies. She is always given a general\r\nanesthetic, and the removal is painless at least, if fatal. Pursuing the\r\nconclusions drawn from his long experience, Dr. Brinkley has found that\r\nwomen derive more instant benefit from the glands than men with respect\r\nto their awakened enthusiasm, improved appearance, and recovery of the\r\nfeeling of poise and well-being. Very noticeable is the change of figure\r\nwhich follows the implanting of the new ovaries in the case of a fat\r\nwoman. The change is equally marked in the case of a fat man. A man of\r\nabnormal weight, 250 lbs., lost fifty pounds in two weeks following the\r\noperation, during which time he remained at the hospital, feeling well\r\nand strong, but shrinking in girth amazingly. When he left the hospital\r\nhis clothes hung about him in bags and folds. The fat woman's spirits\r\nseem to rise as her weight decreases, and she feels as if she had indeed\r\nregained the buoyancy of her youth.\r\n\r\nDr. Brinkley by no means asserts that the woman whose ovaries have been\r\nremoved by surgical operation will grow two new ovaries after the\r\ntransplantation has been made, but he cites the case of a woman whose\r\novaries had been removed by surgical operation some years previous, the\r\nuterus remaining intact, in whom he implanted two goat-ovaries, and\r\nwhose periods shortly afterwards returned on a four-day basis, with\r\ntwenty-eight-day interval. He does not say that the goat-ovaries\r\ntransplanted into the woman have grown new ovaries, but there remains\r\nthe phenomenon of the renewed menstruation, and this is very difficult\r\nto account for. In barren women, from twenty-eight to thirty-five years\r\nof age, in whom he has found not a diseased, but an atrophied, condition\r\nof the ovaries, the transplantation has invariably been attended with\r\nsuccess to the removal of the barrenness, the new glands evidently\r\nbringing about the development of ova. Nor does Dr. Brinkley say that in\r\nthe case of a man who has had both glands removed by surgical operation,\r\nthe transplantation will produce new glands for the man, and yet he has\r\nhad two successes to offset several failures in this very result,\r\nwithout any clue to why the success followed in the one case and not in\r\nthe other. The work is yet in its infancy stage, and Dr. Brinkley is the\r\nfirst to admit that there is far more about it to be known than he has\r\nyet succeeded in knowing. He is averse to experimenting upon women\r\npatients at this stage of his knowledge, and has many times refused to\r\ntransplant the glands for women who have requested him to perform the\r\noperation for them. One such case was at the hospital during the\r\nwriter's visit there in April. She was a paralysis case, quite fat,\r\nunable to walk except by putting forward one foot at a time, supported\r\nby the arm of someone on each side of her. She was driven to the\r\nhospital in an automobile, accompanied by her husband and daughter, from\r\nthe farm--two hundred miles away! Dr. Brinkley strongly urged her not to\r\nhave the gland operation performed at all, but she insisted upon giving\r\nit a trial. It is too soon yet to speak of results in this case, but in\r\nDr. Brinkley's view it is asking too much of the glands to expect them\r\nto produce favorable results in a case of this severity. Yet, at this\r\ntime, there was in the hospital a young woman suffering from Dementia\r\nPraecox, whose mother had been watching over her for twelve years, and\r\non whom the affliction of her daughter had so weighed that she told the\r\nwriter she wished God would take one or the other of them, because it\r\nwas more than she could bear. This young woman had been confined in the\r\nState Hospital for the Insane, and had been treated by specialists for\r\nmany years, without any benefit at all. There was some homicidal mania,\r\nmuch depression, and attempts at suicide. She could not be left alone in\r\nher room for a moment. But the day after the transplantation of the\r\nglands this young woman embraced her mother, and talked so rationally to\r\nher that she called in Dr. Brinkley, and with tears repeated what her\r\ndaughter had just said. Dr. Brinkley advised her that the results were\r\naltogether too sudden to build upon. \"There will certainly be ups and\r\ndowns yet,\" he said. \"You must expect good days and bad days, when you\r\nwill doubt if your daughter is any better. But, to make a normal\r\nrecovery, she +ought+ to show an alternation of good and bad days, with\r\nthe good days gradually drawing ahead and becoming more frequent and\r\nmore marked. I look for her to recover entirely in a year's time, but\r\nshe will always retain her sensitiveness and a certain amount of\r\nhysteria, so that things that would not bother you or me will hurt her\r\ngrievously. You must be prepared to expect this to happen. But I see no\r\nreason at all why she should not in the near future become a happy wife\r\nand mother.\" The blessings of this good mother were a reward in\r\nthemselves, and were so received by the doctor and his wife. When such\r\nresults as this are obtained it becomes very difficult to draw a line\r\nand say, \"The goat-glands will do no good here.\" Physicians of the best\r\nstanding had said to this poor mother before she took her daughter to\r\nKansas, \"So you're determined to try the goat-glands? You are wasting\r\nyour time and money. Brinkley is nothing but a fake. If there were any\r\nhelp for your daughter we could cure her. We can do nothing. There is no\r\nhelp for her!\" This was repeated to the writer by the mother, and he\r\nvouches for its truth. Is it not evident that a better understanding of\r\nthe goat-gland operation is highly desirable among physicians and\r\nsurgeons today?\r\n\r\nQuite a frequent style of inquiry from women to the doctor runs like\r\nthis: \"I am in good health, and in every way normal; age 35. I want to\r\nremain as I am, and grow no older in appearance than I am today. Do you\r\nthink that the goat-gland operation would keep me from getting any\r\nolder?\" To this kind of inquiry Dr. Brinkley makes a stereotyped reply,\r\nsomething as follows: \"If you are today in good health I should not\r\nadvise the goat-gland operation, but would advise it in your case as\r\nsoon as you have passed the change of life, in ten or fifteen years from\r\nnow.\" To the writer he said, \"I cannot conscientiously advise this woman\r\nto submit to this operation, because I don't know that the glands would\r\nadvantage her in any way. They might, or they might not. I don't know.\r\nIt is therefore experimental work, and I cannot take her money for an\r\nexperiment. I must have something definite in the way of experience to\r\ngo upon. There must be some evident condition of ill-health to be set\r\nright. But, on the other hand, though I will not advise these people to\r\ntake the gland operation, there may be something in her idea that the\r\nglands will arrest age and hold it back. I have never been in a position\r\nwhere I could afford to experiment on young and healthy human beings,\r\nand this point can only be settled by such experiment upon healthy and\r\nyoung human beings. I should say at a guess that the operation would do\r\nher no good, but you understand that this is a guess only. I do not know\r\nanything about it. All such things as this we shall learn by degrees by\r\nfurther experiment. At present I am kept busy attending to cases of real\r\nsickness, or defined conditions of arrest of function, where I have\r\nexperience to guide me in saying that the gland-operation will be of\r\nbenefit, but, if I could afford to perform a few of these experimental\r\noperations for nothing, at no cost to the patient, I should be glad of\r\nthe chance. There is so much yet to be learned in this work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDR. BRINKLEY'S OWN STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe +New York American+, issue of March 14, 1920, carried the following\r\narticles:\r\n\r\n  +GOAT GLANDS SUCCESSFUL+\r\n\r\n  +Head of Hospital Tells of the Curing of Sterility\r\n  by the New Discovery and of Control of Sex\r\n  Through Simple Operation--Disease\r\n  and Insanity Also Banished.+\r\n\r\n  +By Dr. W. H. Ballou+\r\n\r\nDr. J. R. Brinkley, head of the Brinkley-Jones Hospital and Training\r\nSchool for Nurses at Milford, Kansas, has now furnished to the\r\nscientific world what are termed \"ample proof cases\" that by\r\nimplantation of the fresh interstitial glands of the goat sterile people\r\nmay bear children of either sex desired. Already the town is filling up\r\nwith childless people waiting to be operated upon. Incidentally, cases\r\nof insanity are cured within thirty-six hours after a simple operation.\r\nOther diseases also disappear. Milford is a small town 150 miles west of\r\nKansas City. Here Dr. Brinkley has performed more than 100 major\r\noperations, and more than 300 minor operations, each one a success;\r\ncured more than 1,000 cases of Influenza, without losing a case; and\r\ncured one \"hopeless\" case of sleeping-sickness.\r\n\r\nThe practice of Dr. Brinkley accords with the investigations of glands\r\nby Professor Arthur Keith, president of the Anthropological Section of\r\nthe British Association for the Advancement of Science. Professor Keith\r\nstates: \"The interstitial gland has as much to do with the growth, in\r\ncertain particulars, as the pituitary gland has in general bodily\r\ngrowth. All of the changes we see in children after they begin to grow,\r\nwhich bring to prominence racial characteristics, depend upon the action\r\nof the interstitial gland. If the gland is removed, or remains in\r\nabeyance, the maturing of the body is prolonged or altered. Sex\r\ndifferences, the more robust manifestations of males, are more emphatic\r\nin the white than in either the black or yellow race. This is shown in\r\nthe beardless face and almost hairless body of Mongols and Negroes, and\r\nespecially in Nilotic tribes of Negroes with long, stork-like legs,\r\nwhich is a manifestation of abeyance of the interstitial gland. As she\r\ngrows aged, and her sexual condition closes, woman assumes the coarser\r\nand more masculine appearance, due to the loss of functioning of this\r\ngland. It is the prime factor in differentiating the races of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nKingsley affirms, in \"Comparative Morphology of Vertebrates\" that\r\n\"interstitial cells carries secretions in man which pass into the blood.\r\nThey apparently cause secondary male characters such as, among other\r\nthings, hair on the face and change of voice at the close of boyhood.\r\nThey govern most female characteristics.\"\r\n\r\nWe are on the eve of a tremendous revolution, which must cause a drastic\r\nrevision of all works on zoology, anatomy, genetics, physiology, and\r\nevolution in general. The enormous investigations of glands and their\r\nsecretions have sprung up and focused since the middle of the World War\r\nperiod. These investigations are rapidly resulting in a new surgery and\r\na new practice of medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +Discoverer of New Method of Rejuvenation\r\n  Tells History+\r\n\r\n  By Dr. J. R. Brinkley\r\n\r\nMy first operation was upon a husband in a childless family, forty-six\r\nyears old, and married for sixteen years. His wife was forty-two years\r\nold. I transplanted in him the interstitial gland of a male goat. His\r\nhealth improved almost at once, and he thereafter looked and acted like\r\na man many years younger. Within a year he was the father of a fine baby\r\nboy. The father continues to retain his improved vitality. The boy was\r\nnamed \"Billy\" in honor of the goat.\r\n\r\nNext a young woman came to me for the operation. I found her glands\r\ndiseased, removed them, and replaced them with the interstitial glands\r\nof a male goat. Her recovery was speedy. A year later she gave birth to\r\na strong boy baby, now four months old. These were but the beginnings.\r\nOther women desired female offspring and have received the glands of the\r\nfemale goat. There are now some twenty-five cases in the hospital at\r\nMilford receiving goat-glands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEMENTIA PRAECOX CASE, AND MISS LEWIS HEAD NURSE]\r\n\r\n+Insanity Is Cured.+ In the hospital is a man who came from New York\r\nCity recently and received two male goat-glands upon his arrival. During\r\nhis past he had been in three New York Insane Asylums, and had gone to\r\nthe Mayo and other institutions. Nothing had been accomplished for his\r\ncase, and he had been told finally that he was incurable and must remain\r\na mental defective. He had decided to commit suicide if I failed to\r\nremedy his condition. In thirty-six hours after the insertion of\r\ngoat-glands his temperature had risen to above 103 degrees, but became\r\nnormal twenty-four hours later, and has since remained so. His mind has\r\ngradually cleared, he looks and feels younger, and is contemplating\r\nmarriage. The hideous dreams and nightmares which had destroyed his\r\nsleep and rest for many past years have left him, and he now eats and\r\nsleeps well. Apparently the cure is complete.\r\n\r\nA case of Dementia Praecox, violent in character, was brought to me as a\r\nresult of the cure in the above case. Restraint was necessary, even to\r\nthe strapping of his hands, feet and body to the bed. He was in all\r\nrespects a typical insane asylum case, destined to remain under\r\nrestraint. The second day after two male goat glands had been inserted\r\nhe spoke to me, saying, \"Doctor, won't you please remove the straps so I\r\ncan rest comfortably? I am perfectly aware of everything now and feel as\r\nif snatched from the grave.\" We removed his shackles and on the\r\nfollowing day he called for books to read. He made a beautiful\r\nconvalescence and a perfect recovery. He is now with his wife and\r\nchildren at home, transacting his business as a normal and sane man.\r\nSince 90 per cent of insanity cases and 75 per cent of divorce cases are\r\ndue to diseased glands, I may be pardoned for holding out hope to a\r\nvast, hopeless class, numbered at over 3,000,000 Americans.\r\n\r\n+Sterility Is Banished.+ As a rule the women who come to me for\r\ntreatment prefer to bear male children. In such cases it is essential\r\nthat they should receive the interstitial glands of the male goat. We\r\nhave in hospital at the moment, however, a childless married woman of\r\ntwenty-eight, who wishes devoutly for a female child. We found her\r\nsterile of a natural gland and inserted the gland of a female goat. Her\r\ntransformation has been remarkable, and I am confident her first child\r\nwill be a girl.\r\n\r\nYou naturally ask about the future, which can only be premised. Women\r\nwho have received male goat-glands will continue to bear male children,\r\nif any; those that receive the female goat glands will continue to bear\r\ngirl babies. The future carries a promise of much information to be\r\ngleaned along this line. I cannot say what would happen if the husband\r\nwere to receive male goat glands and the wife female goat glands. Their\r\nprogeny might or might not be mixed. We will try it on any sterile\r\ncouple that desires, knowing positively that normal children of one or\r\nboth sexes will result.\r\n\r\nWhere substitution of glands of any character is essential, they should\r\nbe taken from the goat operated upon immediately before the human\r\nimplanting, and be inserted at once. Glands should not be taken from the\r\nape or other animal for human use. The goat is immune to tuberculosis,\r\nHe is a clean animal, full of health and vitality. Apes are very subject\r\nto tuberculosis. One can never tell whether an ape is diseaseless or\r\nnot. It is generally unlawful to substitute our human glands, and, even\r\nthough they could be readily obtained, they are apt to be infected with\r\nsome disease.\r\n\r\nThe essential element of foods is the vitamin, a nitrogenous substance\r\nof indeterminate nature. Without it we would starve, though eating\r\nplenty of proteins, carbo-hydrates, fats, salts and water. Nothing will\r\nsustain life if the vitamins are absent from the diet. Goat's milk\r\ncontains these important substances in greater abundance than any other\r\nanimal food.\r\n\r\n+The Goat Reacts Like Human.+ The goat alone among mammals reacts to\r\npoisons almost identically as human beings react, and the poison gases\r\nof the war had precisely the same effect upon him as upon the soldiers.\r\nSo 1,500 goats did their bit in the war in an experimental way. These\r\npoints in his favor, and other similarities to man, are the reasons\r\nwhich led me to select the goat as the best possible material in this\r\nwork. Goat-glands alone seemed to be harmonious and sympathetic when\r\ntransplanted into the human body. In other words, the hormones of goat\r\nand man agree.\r\n\r\nWe still know less about the causes of hormones than the effects. On\r\naccount of the mutual tolerance of goat and human hormones the goat\r\ngland speedily attaches a blood supply in the human body, and cell by\r\ncell is replaced so that it soon functions as the original gland would\r\nhad it been present and normal. The new gland is also exceptional in\r\nthat it does not have to be placed near or at the location of the proper\r\nhuman gland. It can be inserted in any place where it is not liable to\r\ninjury, even in the hip in men.[*]\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that I do not claim to make old men young again, or\r\nthat I have discovered the secret fountain of youth. I am engaged in the\r\npractical work of giving health, normality and progeny to men and women\r\nwho have been cheated out of their natural heritage. I have named the\r\nprocess \"re-creative gland operation\" in accordance with the belief now\r\ngeneral among genetists and anatomists that if the clock of time is ever\r\nto be turned back for humanity it can only be through glandular\r\ntransplantations. Glands have proved much superior to any animal extract\r\nor serum in this class of cases. Often in serums the poison elements are\r\nretained, but not the nutritive. We use the whole goat gland, as a rule,\r\nbecause we do not know in what part of it the hormones hide. The\r\nattempted transplantations of kidneys have thus far failed because the\r\nkidney product is waste matter, not live cells as in the case of the\r\ninterstitial glands.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote: Author's Note.--The date of this interview is more than\r\n    one year old, March, 1920. Today Dr. Brinkley implants the male\r\n    glands by incision in the acrotum of the man, and in no other\r\n    place whatever, having found this method of operation the most\r\n    sure in results. Today he uses only the male goat-glands for the\r\n    man, and only the female goat's ovaries for the woman.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  (From The Chicago Tribune, of date February 1, 1920.)\r\n\r\n  +GOAT GLANDS GIVE BABIES TO CHILDLESS.+\r\n\r\n  +Woman and Three Men Become Parents After\r\n  Transplantation.+\r\n\r\nMilford, Kansas.--A surgeon in this little Kansas town has lifted from\r\nwomanhood the curse of sterility.\r\n\r\nHe is Dr. J. R. Brinkley, chief surgeon of the Brinkley-Jones Hospital\r\nof Milford.\r\n\r\nFor several years Dr. Brinkley has made a study of the transplantation\r\nof the interstitial glands and its results. Two years ago he performed\r\nhis first operation upon a human being. Since then he has circumvented\r\nnature four times, making it possible for three men and one woman to\r\nbecome parents. He is awaiting results hopefully in four other cases.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable case is that of the woman. She is a young married\r\nwoman of Milford, who had been married several years and had despaired\r\nof bearing children. About a year and a half ago she heard of Dr.\r\nBrinkley and his success with interstitial gland operations. She went to\r\nhim and asked him if he could cure her sterility. Dr. Brinkley made no\r\npromises--he never does. But he told her the operation was a simple one,\r\nand that it would improve her health, even if it failed to give her a\r\nchild. She gladly submitted to the operation.\r\n\r\nDr. Brinkley removed an interstitial gland from a live male goat. He\r\nmade a slight incision in the woman's abdomen, inserted the gland and\r\nstitched it in. In a week the patient was about her household duties\r\nagain. Six months ago she gave birth to a healthy baby. It was a boy.\r\nThe mother was the happiest woman in Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon had treated six other cases similarly, but all were men--men\r\nwho loved children and yearned for parenthood. Three of the men are now\r\nfathers of healthy children.\r\n\r\nIn each case Dr. Brinkley had used male goat glands--and all the babies\r\nwere boys.\r\n\r\nThen this occurred to him:--\r\n\r\n\"If I transplant female goat glands maybe the babies will be girls!\" He\r\ndecided to try it, and two months ago his opportunity arrived. A woman\r\ncame to him just as his first woman patient had come. She was 28 years\r\nold, had been married six years, and was childless. Dr. Brinkley\r\nperformed the operation, using the glands of a female goat. He is now\r\nawaiting results. \"I do not say this woman will have a girl baby,\" said\r\nDr. Brinkley today, \"but I am experimenting. It may be merely a\r\ncoincidence that all the babies so far have been boys. So far as I know,\r\nI am the first surgeon to experiment with gland implantation in women.\r\nI am also the first to use goat glands in preference to others.\r\n\r\n\"Unquestionably I have cured sterility in one woman, and I have utmost\r\nfaith that it can be cured in any other, so long as all of her organs\r\nare not missing. The operation is a little more difficult than it is in\r\nthe case of men, but no more serious. Where a man recovers, and can get\r\nabout, in two or three days, a woman recovers in a week.\r\n\r\n\"All of my patients are much improved in their general health as a\r\nresult of the operation. I wouldn't say that this operation holds the\r\nsecret of eternal youth. I don't know. All my patients have been between\r\nthe ages of 32 and 48, so that I cannot speak from experience.\r\nI believe, however, that the operation will prolong life; I know that it\r\nimproves the health in every way. But I cannot say that it will restore\r\nthe bloom of youth to an old man's cheek. I am considering, however, an\r\noperation upon a man 80 years old who came to me and asked for the\r\noperation. Whether he would be able to have children as a result of it I\r\ndo not know.\"\r\n\r\nNone of Dr. Brinkley's patients had been parents until they came to him.\r\nNow the oldest of the babies is 13 months; another is 8 months and a\r\nthird is 6. Dr. Brinkley does not claim to be a specialist in gland\r\nimplantation; he is merely a practicing surgeon who has made a study of\r\nthe subject and is doing what he can to help unfortunate people. The\r\ndoctor's modesty until now has hidden his remarkable discovery from the\r\nworld, but he is now writing a report on his results.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (From the San Diego, Cal., +Union+, of date,\r\n  February 7, 1920.)\r\n\r\nScientists who formerly ignored Dr. Brinkley's letters are now writing\r\nto him asking him for exhaustive reports of his work. The sarcastic\r\nattitude came largely heretofore from those who were unwilling to\r\nbelieve that such operations of the highest scientific importance, were\r\nbeing performed in an out of the way village that couldn't be found on a\r\nrailway map.\r\n\r\nDr. Brinkley, who was graduated from the Medical Department of Loyola\r\nUniversity, and who has traveled over all the world, explained his\r\nresidence in Milford. After leaving the army he sought a location in a\r\nsmall town, selecting Milford as the result of a newspaper\r\nadvertisement, and going there, found it to consist of less than 200\r\ninhabitants. But the surrounding territory was rich and the farmers\r\nprosperous, and in the isolated location he saw the chance of continuing\r\nexperiments begun at Bellevue Hospital, New York. Later he found himself\r\ncompelled to build his own hospital to care for the patients that\r\narrived, attracted by the news of the goat-gland operations. Dr.\r\nBrinkley is 35 years old and has been a skilled surgeon for more than 15\r\nyears. He is a member of the American Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience, the American Medical Association, the Missouri Valley Medical\r\nAssociation, the Kansas Medical Association, and a Fellow of the\r\nClinical Congress of Internal Medicine. He is also a 32nd Degree Mason.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of pneumonia and influenza Dr. Brinkley uses serums of\r\nhis own invention. In the treatment of his cases of influenza last year\r\nthe reports of the health authorities of Geary County, Kansas, show that\r\nDr. Brinkley didn't lose a single case. Milford is in Geary County, and\r\nGeary County swears by Dr. Brinkley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nA YEAR OF DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intention in offering for your perusal the preceding newspaper\r\naccounts of Dr. Brinkley's work in the opening months of the year 1920\r\nwas to show you what his views at that time were regarding the value of\r\nthe gland operation which he has since made his life-work. The Chicago\r\nTribune speaks of it as incidental to his general work as a surgeon. Dr.\r\nBrinkley himself speaks of shortly beginning an experiment upon an old\r\nman of 80. A year later he looked back upon a record of achievement of\r\nthe most astounding results in operations performed upon men of 75, 80,\r\nand even 81. During this past year he has perfected his technique,\r\nimplants the male glands exclusively into men and the female glands or\r\novaries into women, and has definitely selected the scrotum of the man\r\nas the only right place in which to introduce the goat-glands for the\r\ntransplantation. You are here viewing the development of a great\r\nscientific discovery from the beginning of its employment upon human\r\nbeings. Nor is there any reason to suppose that the year 1922 will\r\nproduce no embellishment of value in the form of a wider application of\r\nthe method. Some very striking limitations have been established during\r\nthe past year's work. For instance:\r\n\r\nIf the blood examination shows a positive Wasserman test for syphilis it\r\nis useless to transplant the glands, because they will certainly slough\r\nout. Active syphilis is antagonistic to the goat-tissue. Even latent\r\nsyphilis, showing a negative Wasserman, is likely to produce a slough of\r\nthe glands. Nothing should be concealed from the doctor, of course, and\r\nyet it has happened at the hospital at Milford that a patient on being\r\nquestioned in advance of the operation has emphatically stated that he\r\nhad never contracted syphilis, and three days later, after the\r\ntransplantation, when the sloughing of the new glands had shown\r\nsomething definitely wrong with the blood, this patient admitted that he\r\nhad not spoken the truth in the matter, but had contracted the disease\r\nmany years previously. On the other hand, in Locomoter Ataxia, in which\r\nthere is invariably a history of syphilis, the goat-glands take hold\r\nwithout exception, the efficacy of the transplantation in this disease,\r\nhitherto incurable by any means known to man, being due to the power of\r\nthe new glands to cause a dissolving of scar-tissue, in the opinion of\r\nDr. Abrams of San Francisco, who investigated the remarkable results\r\nattained by Dr. Brinkley in his cures of Locomoter Ataxia by the\r\ngoat-gland operation.\r\n\r\nIf the goat-glands are transplanted into members of the Hebrew race\r\nthere follows invariably a high temperature persisting for several days,\r\nafter which the cure proceeds normally without any untoward occurrence.\r\nGlands transplanted into a negro will slough, or, at least, they did so\r\nin the one case on which Dr. Brinkley performed the operation, for no\r\napparent reason other than a supposed racial antagonism to goat-tissue.\r\nNo experiments have yet been conducted upon Japanese, Chinese, Hindus,\r\nor our native Indians. When the blood count shows high in white\r\n(leucocytes) and low in red, the glands will slough, but the reverse\r\ncondition does not hold true. And now let us consider the case of Mr.\r\nErnst, of Morganville, Kansas, who is over 77 years of age, and who\r\npermits the use of his name and address. One of the most curious\r\nfeatures of his case is that when he came for the operation his hair,\r\nwhite as snow, was thin on the scalp, the color of the skin of the scalp\r\nshowing through the hair, as it frequently does in the aged. That was\r\nalmost a year ago. Mr. Ernst's hair is now turning black all over the\r\nhead, the scalp shows a thickening in the growth, or an increase in the\r\nquantity of hair, and you cannot now see the scalp through the hair. Mr.\r\nErnst wrote an excellent letter to Dr. Brinkley two months ago, and\r\nstates that he has no objection at all to its reproduction. When a\r\npersonal story of this kind is offered for use it is as well to use it\r\nin its original form, but this so rarely happens in this work that for\r\nits uniqueness alone it would be worth while to put it before you. With\r\nsome notable exceptions, the men patients who have been operated upon by\r\nDr. Brinkley feel ashamed of the fact. Not for anything would they let\r\ntheir friends or acquaintances know anything about it. The veil of\r\nsecrecy is, of course, never lifted by the doctor. The women patients\r\nhave none of this false shame, apparently, but enjoy discussing the\r\nresults of the operation with their friends. It is, perhaps, natural\r\nthat a United States Senator, two of whom have been operated on with\r\nmuch advantage to themselves, should shrink from the jocose remarks of\r\nfriend or foe and the curiosity of acquaintances. There is good reason,\r\nin the case of a public man, for avoidance of notice in the matter, and\r\nthat is one of the advantages of having the hospital located in the tiny\r\nvillage of Milford. If freedom from observation is the wish it is\r\ncertainly gratified there. Agreeing, therefore, on the whole, with the\r\nreticence of the public man in this matter, we yet feel a certain\r\nsatisfaction in the robust avowals of Mr. Ernst. Follows his letter of\r\nJanuary, 1921:\r\n\r\n\"I am 77 years old, employed as commercial salesman by one of the\r\nlargest manufacturing companies of its kind in the world, and command a\r\ngood salary and the confidence of my employers. Since my operation at\r\nDr. Brinkley's hospital I am now their free lance salesman, opening up\r\nnew territory and making good money. Any doubting Thomas may send me a\r\nself-addressed envelope if he questions the genuineness of what I say\r\nhere about myself, and I will take time to answer him. First, the\r\noperation is absolutely painless. For a number of years I was a martyr\r\nto Sciatica and Muscular Rheumatism. I used every Patent Medicine I\r\ncould hear of, besides Osteopathy and Chiropractic, and innumerable\r\nprescriptions from physicians, and received no benefit at all. The\r\nsciatic trouble was bad enough, but to this you must add loss of memory,\r\nhydrocele, kidney trouble, constipation, no appetite, and insomnia. Most\r\nnights two hours sleep was the most I could get, for the pains were\r\nincessant. I read in ... the +Kansas City Post+ last Spring about Dr.\r\nBrinkley's Goat-Gland operation, and decided to try it right away. I was\r\nin such misery I would have tried +anything+. Now I want to tell you, in\r\nthe fewest words, that the amazing truth is that I have not had a twinge\r\nof pain of any kind at all since the operation, and have only a memory\r\nof my former suffering. This is a marvelous thing. I have the feeling of\r\na youth. Whenever you want to hear from me I will write again and tell\r\nyou what changes have taken place in me as the result of this operation.\r\nIf I was asked to put a cash value upon the operation in my own case I\r\ncould not do it, but I can say that all I possess in cash would be a\r\npoor equivalent for the difference the operation has made in my life.\r\nWhat is the difference in cash value between a life that is worth living\r\nand one that is constant misery? I don't know how you would fix that\r\nvalue, but that is the difference the operation has made in me.\r\n\r\n  S. H. ERNST.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Brinkley has kept in close touch with Mr. Ernst, and received other\r\nletters, not for publication, in which the old gentleman went frankly\r\ninto details of the change that had been wrought in him by the operation\r\nin the matter of astonishing sexual vigor. For obvious reasons such\r\ndetails, while of the greatest scientific interest, cannot be more than\r\nhinted at in a book, and we must content ourselves with the acceptance\r\nof the fact as a fact of interest to science, to Dr. Brinkley, to the\r\nworld of aged men at our doors, and to Mr. Ernst particularly, rejoicing\r\nin his new-found vigor.\r\n\r\nApart from the genuinely happy tone of his letters to Dr. Brinkley, the\r\nphenomenon of the darkening of the hair strikes most sharply on the\r\nattention. Perhaps our satisfaction in this particular piece of evidence\r\nof rejuvenation is due to the fact that it is an objective proof;\r\nsomething visible to the eye, tangible; something for which we are not\r\nrequired to take anybody's opinion, but can trust our eyesight for the\r\nfact of it. It is something in which the psychic factor, the feelings,\r\nthe imagination, the auto-suggestion, does not enter at all, and that is\r\nwhy it is exceedingly well worthy of note. Looking back over the years,\r\nand casting up in your minds all the people of sixty and seventy years\r\nof age whom you have known, can you put your finger on a single one\r\nwhose hair turned in color from white to dark and at the same time from\r\nthin to thick? You probably cannot. Nor can the writer. It is reasonable\r\nto conclude, therefore, that the goat-glands alone have done this thing\r\nin the case of Mr. Ernst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF CHANCELLOR TOBIAS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must go to the pages of +The Chicago Evening American+ of date August\r\n18, 1920, for the story of Chancellor Tobias, written by Lloyd Lehrbas,\r\nof the American staff, with a brief introductory note, as follows:\r\n\r\n(Here is one of the most remarkable news stories ever published in any\r\nChicago newspaper. So startling is its detail that +The Chicago Evening\r\nAmerican+ in the interest of absolute accuracy submitted it to the\r\nperson most concerned for his approval, so there can be no question\r\nconcerning the facts, scientific or otherwise. Other men and women\r\ninvolved are not mentioned because the facts being established in the\r\nmost important case, it is not considered necessary.)\r\n\r\nGoat interstitial gland operations have been successfully performed on\r\nJ. J. Tobias, Chancellor of the Chicago Law School, and thirty-five\r\nother Chicago men and women by Dr. J. R. Brinkley, of Milford, Kansas,\r\nwho has been in Chicago for the past six weeks, performing the\r\noperations every day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRINKLEY HOSPITAL, MILFORD, KANSAS, U.S.A.]\r\n\r\nAn alderman, a well-known political figure, living on the Gold Coast,\r\na judge, a prominent real estate man, a newspaper man, three women, one\r\nof whom is well known on the North Shore, and other Chicagoans, have\r\nfound the lost Fountain of Youth as a result of the miracle-surgeon's\r\ntransplanting the revivifying interstitial glands of a goat into their\r\nhuman bodies.\r\n\r\nThe story of Dr. Brinkley's knife magic is the story of a surgeon's\r\nstudy and experimenting for nine years, ending with the successful\r\naccomplishment of the gland operation performed on thirty-six\r\nChicagoans, who are alive and healthy today.\r\n\r\nThe complete story, with laboratory data, the name of one of the\r\nprominent patients, and an authorized interview with Dr. Brinkley is\r\ntold for the first time in +The Evening American+ today.\r\n\r\n+Successful on Women.+ Proof that the operation has been successful on\r\nwomen as well as men makes the story of increased interest. Until now it\r\nhas been the general conception that the operation was successful on men\r\nonly. A Chicago woman is now supremely happy because, after years of\r\nhoping, the operation has made it possible for her to become a mother.\r\n\r\nFive months ago, Chancellor Tobias was, in his own words, played out.\r\nHis years of teaching in the Chicago Law School had reduced his\r\nvitality.\r\n\r\nChancellor Tobias went to Dr. Brinkley's hospital and submitted to the\r\noperation in order to relieve arterial congestion in the brain, caused\r\nby two attacks of influenza, a year apart. So serious had become his\r\ncondition and so severe the attacks of vertigo and high blood pressure,\r\nthat his attending physician informed him he was in imminent danger of\r\ndeath. The planting of the interstitial glands in Chancellor Tobias'\r\nbody relieved the congestion and fully eliminated the cause.\r\n\r\n+Purged of All Ills.+ Today he has dropped the years from his shoulders,\r\npurged his body and brain of ills, and stands revivified.\r\n\r\n\"I feel like a youth again,\" the aged chancellor said today. \"I'm a new\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nThe stories of the other Chicagoans who have been benefited by the\r\noperation read like fiction. They were ill, they were old, they\r\napparently were beyond the skill of the surgeon's knife, or spiritual\r\nhope. Now from their own lips come paeans of glorification for restored\r\nvitality and youth, all due to the humble goat and the surgical skill of\r\na country surgeon.\r\n\r\n+Tobias' Own Story.+ Today I called at the law school in the Monadnock\r\nBuilding to see Chancellor Tobias and get the story from his own lips.\r\nThe reports seemed too rosy. The facts seemed overstated. The results\r\nappeared to me unduly magnified. But here was a prominent lawyer who had\r\nthe operation performed. Here was assurance there would be no buncombe\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nAn alert, peppy, gray-haired man sprang up to greet me, his eyes, the\r\neyes of youth, his step firm and sprightly, his handclasp steady and\r\nstrong. And yet he was 71 years old!\r\n\r\n\"Do you really feel younger?\"\r\n\r\n+Twenty-five Years Younger.+ Chancellor Tobias threw out his chest,\r\nsquared his shoulders,--and smiled. \"I feel twenty-five years younger.\r\nI'm a new man, strong, and good for twenty years of work,\" he replied.\r\n\"I was ill, old, and played out, but the operation has completely\r\nrevivified me.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does it feel to have been old, and then become young again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Glorious!\"\r\n\r\n+Was \"Played Out.\"+ And here is Chancellor Tobias' story of the fountain\r\nof youth.\r\n\r\n\"After teaching for twenty-five years in the Chicago Law School,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I was played out. I suffered intense headaches. My eyesight began\r\nfailing. There was a constant ringing in my ears. Dizziness came with\r\nincreasing regularity. Mentally and physically I was an old man. Then I\r\nheard of Dr. Brinkley.\"\r\n\r\nChancellor Tobias went to Milford, Kansas, as a last hope in March of\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\nOn March 26 Dr. Brinkley selected a two months' old goat and removed the\r\ninterstitial glands. They were placed in a solution at body heat and\r\ntaken to the operating room. Dr. Tobias was given an anesthetic. Dr.\r\nBrinkley leaned over the operating table, made a quick, accurate\r\nincision, planted the goat gland, and fifteen minutes later the\r\noperation was over.\r\n\r\n+Eyesight Improves.+ \"Four days after the operation,\" the Chancellor\r\ncontinued, \"the headaches had disappeared, and my eyesight was greatly\r\nimproved. And seven days afterwards, I left the hospital a new man.\"\r\n\r\nOne month after the operation Chancellor Tobias wrote to Dr. Brinkley:\r\n\"I really feel twenty years younger. My health has improved wonderfully.\r\nI have regained my lost vigor and vitality. I'm a recreated youth.\"\r\n\r\nAnd today even Chancellor Tobias' fellow faculty members, many of them\r\nnationally famous attorneys, admit that Dr. Tobias has improved 100 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n+\"Almost Unbelievable.\"+ \"I hesitate to speak of this,\" Chancellor\r\nTobias said. \"It is so wonderful it is almost unbelievable. The public\r\ncannot appreciate what the operation means. There has been some levity\r\nover the news of the gland operations, but it should be treated with the\r\ngreatest respect and admiration. The operation has been a success on me\r\nso I am in a position to speak authoritatively. It is one of the\r\ngreatest things of the century.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the other thirty-five patients who have been successfully operated\r\non are many well-known to thousands of people in Chicago. Here are some\r\ntypical Chicago cases omitting names:\r\n\r\nPoliceman ----, aged 60, suffering from chronic diabetes and a general\r\nbreakdown, which was about to compel his retirement from the force.\r\nOperated on August 9. Left the hospital yesterday feeling like \"a new\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nAlderman ----, aged 55, chronic asthma sufferer. Operated on April 26.\r\nAsthma had disappeared by the time he left the hospital. Declared he\r\nfelt years younger and is now completely revivified.\r\n\r\nMr. G----, newspaperman, aged 39. Suffered from complete nervous\r\nbreakdown from overwork. Operated on April 25. Resumed work almost\r\nimmediately, full of pep, and today is the picture of health.\r\n\r\nJudge ----, aged 58. Premature old age from hardening of the arteries.\r\nOperated on April 28. Because of his wonderful improvement in health has\r\nchanged his mind about retiring from the bench.\r\n\r\n+Operation Painless.+ \"Ignorance about the gland transplanting is almost\r\nuniversal,\" I told Dr. Brinkley. \"I know nothing of it. Tell me how it\r\nis done, why you use goat-glands, all the whys and wherefores, so the\r\nreaders of +The American+ will have some authentic information. Is the\r\noperation painful?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Dr. Brinkley replied. \"It is a simple incision with very little\r\nactual pain. In practically all cases a local anesthetic is used.\r\nA general anesthetic is used only in exceptional cases.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long does the operation take?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifteen to twenty minutes. It is as simple as grafting new shoots on a\r\nfruit tree. No part of the human gland is removed. The goat-gland is\r\nsimply planted to take the place of the old gland.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the hospital confinement?\"\r\n\r\n\"One week, to rest the patient and allow the gland to begin functioning\r\nwithout undue exertion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"None whatever. It's like grafting on a piece of skin. There is\r\nabsolutely no danger.\"\r\n\r\n+Eliminates Disorders.+ Lost youth is regained, according to Dr.\r\nBrinkley, as a result of the revivifying fluid secreted by the\r\ntransplanted gland, leading to the elimination of organic disorders that\r\nare hastening old age.\r\n\r\nDr. Brinkley explained in detail:\r\n\r\n\"I began my experiments nine years ago, and began using goat-glands\r\nthree years ago in the interstitial gland operation because the\r\ngoat-glands resemble to a large degree the human glands in their\r\nhistological make-up. The interstitial glands and the blood, of a goat,\r\nare a very close approach in their constituents to those of a human\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n\"Old people are simply broken down. The goat-gland secretes the fluid\r\nthat builds up the brokendown parts of the human body. Eyesight improves\r\n50 per cent. If a man is underweight he will gain to normal, and if he\r\nis overweight he will reduce to normal, showing that the goat glands\r\nactually function.\"\r\n\r\n+Chronic Diseases Cured.+ \"Chronic skin diseases are cleared up. Stomach\r\ntrouble disappears under the new gland's guardianship of the body.\r\nI have the laboratory data, the scientific records, and the actual\r\nrevivified patients to prove it. The only unsuccessful cases are certain\r\npeople whose blood lacks necessary essentials, and they are few.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Brinkley gives Dr. G. Frank Lydston of Chicago credit for performing\r\nthe first gland transplanting operations.\r\n\r\n+Lydston Is Pioneer.+ \"Dr. Lydston is the pioneer,\" Dr. Brinkley said.\r\n\"He was the first man to transplant glands from a human to a human.\r\nI have never transplanted anthropoid ape glands, as Dr. Voronoff of\r\nParis, and only in three cases human glands, as Dr. Lydston, and I was\r\nnot pleased with the results in those three cases. I was the first to\r\ntransplant goat glands. Dr. Serge Voronoff has performed the operation\r\non only two human beings. He failed to give Dr. Lydston credit, although\r\nit is obvious he followed Dr. Lydston's book.\"\r\n\r\n   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nThis completes Mr. Lehrbas' interview. In the same paper, +The Chicago\r\nEvening American+, a month later, date of September 15, appeared the\r\nfollowing account of another visit to Chancellor Tobias, written by\r\nEdward M. Thierry:\r\n\r\nJ. J. Tobias, chancellor of the Chicago Law School, told me it was none\r\nof my business how old he is. He's got a goat-gland sewed into his\r\ninnards and I was trying to get some personal Ponce de Leon statistics.\r\n\r\n\"I'm over 50,\" Tobias conceded. \"How much I won't say. But I will say my\r\nclock has been turned back from ten to twenty years! Just look at me!\"\r\n\r\nHe jumped out of his chair--er--friskily. That's the only expressive\r\nword. Tobias is little, thin and wiry. His face wrinkles up and his\r\nteeth flash when he smiles. He has grey hair and talks with quick\r\njerks--as if his energy is running a race with his tongue.\r\n\r\n\"I'm rejuvenated,\" Tobias said. \"Time will tell whether my goat-gland\r\nwill make me live longer. I had that operation on last March 26, and I'm\r\nstill living. I'm no decrepit old man, either.\"\r\n\r\nTobias was operated on by Dr. J. R. Brinkley, who has caused a furor in\r\nmedical circles through his many successful goat-gland operations.\r\n\r\nCritics of Dr. Brinkley make Tobias tired. Get his goat, so to speak. He\r\nsays he knows what he's talking about, for he was formerly lecturer in a\r\nChicago medical college.\r\n\r\n\"Seventy-five years ago my father had a little German machine,\" Tobias\r\nsaid, \"called the 'life waker.' It was a disk as big as a dollar with a\r\nlot of needles in it. You jabbed it into the small of the back and waked\r\nlife that way. We can laugh at that archaic system, for it was crude.\r\nNow we're more scientific. Witness the transplantation of goat-glands.\"\r\n\r\nTobias said he went to see Dr. Brinkley at Milford, Kansas, to\r\ninvestigate his goat-gland discovery because of long suffering from\r\ncongestion of the brain arteries. Doctors had told him he was in danger\r\nof death because of severe attacks of vertigo and a high blood pressure.\r\n\r\n\"The operation,\" Tobias said, \"occupied about 20 minutes. Within three\r\nhours after the operation the goat-gland began to function, the\r\ncongestion was relieved, and within three days the cause was eliminated.\r\n\r\n\"I am a new man physically, with new mental vigor, and a new power of\r\nsustained effort. I can distinctly sense the function of a new gland in\r\nmy body.\"\r\n\r\nIt must have functioned muscularly, for when I left Tobias gave me a\r\nknuckle-crushing grip which made it necessary to write this story with\r\nmy left hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese newspaper articles are printed here without change, in spite of\r\nevident repetitions, because of their evidential value. It is an old\r\ntrick of the public press in the United States, and probably in Europe\r\nalso, to start a sensation with a blazing front page story, and in the\r\ncourse of a few weeks follow it with a complete and sarcastic expose of\r\nthe whole matter as a baseless fabrication, piling facts on facts to\r\nshow that the first story was an ingenious piece of deception got up by\r\nthe subject with the purpose of making capital out of the credulity of\r\nthe public. There are no better detectives in the world than newspaper\r\nmen. They work for the love of it. An expose is dearer to the\r\ndetective-instinct in them than a laudatory article, and they leave no\r\nstone unturned to get at the facts. When, therefore, after the lapse of\r\nmonths, the newspapers of the United States repeat and confirm their\r\nfirst stories about Dr. Brinkley's work it means something to one who\r\nknows their methods of working. Money cannot buy this sort of publicity.\r\nThere must be facts, and facts of value, and facts verified again and\r\nagain, before stories of this kind appear and reappear in the great\r\norgans of publicity in all the big cities of the United States. How far\r\nthey carry, and how wide-reaching is the interest, will be understood by\r\nthe statement that the announcement of Dr. Brinkley's work, printed\r\nfirst in American newspapers, and copied in the English papers, has\r\nbrought him urgent requests to visit South Africa, Australia, Sweden,\r\nScotland, and many other countries. From England in particular come\r\nrequests from women that he do not fail to make a journey to some part\r\nof Europe in the summer of 1921, in order that they may take the\r\noperation with a view to bearing children. This he has arranged to do\r\nabout June of this year, expecting to find in England a climate during\r\nthe months of June, July and August, which will not be too hot to\r\nprevent him from transplanting the goat-glands. He does not operate at\r\nhis hospital in Kansas during June, July and August, on account of the\r\nheat, having found that when the outdoor temperature is high the glands\r\nwill certainly slough. The high temperature without seems to create a\r\nhigh temperature for the patient, and the result is a wasted pair of\r\ngood goat glands, with loss of time and money to all concerned. In\r\nEngland in the summer it should be necessary to wait a few days only for\r\nright climatic conditions to present themselves, and be sure that they\r\nwill do so. There are the further matters of a supply of goats of the\r\nright Toggenburg breed, a place to keep them, in close proximity to the\r\noperating hospital, and the hospital itself, to be dealt with suitably\r\nin the shortest possible space of time after arrival. The supply of\r\ngoats can probably be best procured direct from Switzerland through some\r\nLondon importer, and the other matters will no doubt fall easily into\r\nplace. The goats must not come from a high altitude, or their glands\r\nwill not contain a right amount of iodine. This is curiously important.\r\nDr. Brinkley cannot use goats from Colorado for that reason. If the\r\ndoctor's reception in England is cordial he will probably make his visit\r\nthere an annual summer affair of three months' duration for some years\r\nto come, which would give him an opportunity of keeping in continued\r\ntouch with his English and European patients. The English are a\r\npractical people, and less sensitive than we to, or more careless of,\r\nridicule, and they are likely to grasp the importance of Dr. Brinkley's\r\nwork on the instant of his arrival, compelling a long visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR STEINACH AND THE RAT\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting with vivacity and humor, Mr. Clarence Day, Jr., speculates with\r\nso much whimsicality upon the possible effects of surgical rejuvenation\r\nof men that one might overlook the keenness of his observation in a\r\nhurried perusal of his article. For the sake of preserving it for more\r\nleisurely study, and because the points raised are really worthy of\r\nattention, the article is reproduced here in full, with acknowledgments\r\nto +The Literary Review+, in which it first appeared, of date November\r\n20, 1920. Says Mr. Day:\r\n\r\nBiologists really seem to be discovering ways of making men young again.\r\nSo far, it is like making men drunk; the state that is produced does not\r\nlast. But it looks as though they might succeed in adding a chapter to\r\nlife. I wish it could be added to the other end: to youth instead of to\r\nthe last flickers. But if we can renew and re-live middle-age, that will\r\nbe better still.\r\n\r\nA man named Steinach, in Vienna, has been experimenting for ten years\r\nwith rats. Full accounts of his work were published last summer in the\r\ngreat biological journal founded by Roux, and these were summarized and\r\ndiscussed by the London +Athenaeum+, which is now the most interesting\r\nof all English weeklies. It is from the +Athenaeum's+ account that I am\r\ntaking these facts.\r\n\r\nSteinach has been studying the interstitial cells that fill in the\r\nspaces between the tubules of the testes, in males, and between the\r\nfollicles of the ovaries in females. His reason for choosing these cells\r\nfor his experiments is that they are a well-spring of life. Furthermore,\r\nsince all our vital functions are interrelated, to make these cells\r\nactive gives the whole organism new life and strength. This is not the\r\nonly way of stimulating the organism, but it seems the most powerful.\r\n\r\nAn old rat is like a senile old man; he is bald and emaciated, his eyes\r\nare clouded, his breathing is labored. He stays in one place, with bent\r\nback, and has small interest in anything. If you cut one of his genital\r\nducts, however, which is a comparatively slight operation, it has the\r\neffect of making the interstitial cells multiply actively. Waves of life\r\nflood his being. Within a few weeks he is transformed. These currents\r\nrestore and rebuild him; skin, muscle and mind. Both in looks and\r\nbehavior he is indistinguishable from other strong rats.\r\n\r\nHe has cast off old age. Senility, which sets in with men when they are\r\nfrom sixty to eighty years old, begins after twenty to thirty months in\r\na rat. He is then about through. But when an operation is performed on a\r\nsenile rat he gets from six to eight months' new life. In other words,\r\nthe addition to his normal span is 20 to 30 per cent. That would be a\r\nlarge fraction of life for a man to live over again. The rat lives it\r\nvigorously, eagerly, back in his prime.\r\n\r\nWhen senility again comes upon him it is in a modified form. His\r\norganism as a whole is in better shape. It is his mind now that tires.\r\nAs Steinach has already cut one or both of his genital ducts, that\r\nmethod of stimulating his cells cannot, of course, be repeated. But\r\nanother operation is ready. Some unfortunate young male is deprived of\r\nhis testes by Steinach, and these are implanted forthwith in this hoary\r\nold rat.\r\n\r\nA second spell of active life follows, not so long as the first. It ends\r\nin acute psychic senility. The rat goes all to pieces. It is as if the\r\nbrain, twice restimulated to emotion, curiosity, keenness, had\r\napproached the very limit of its running, and was completely exhausted.\r\n\r\nSteinach has not yet tried whether a third rejuvenation is possible.\r\nThat remains to be seen. He lives in Vienna, and everything there has\r\ncome to a stop. He has no assistants, no funds, with which to conduct\r\nfurther experiments. \"May happier lands or cities carry the work on,\" he\r\nwrites at the end.\r\n\r\nIt seems as though some rich American ought to stake the old boy.\r\n\r\n   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nSteinach has naturally found it more difficult to give new youth to\r\nfemales. But here, too, he has in a measure succeeded. X-ray treatment\r\nand ovarian transplantation are the methods employed.\r\n\r\nAs to human experiments, there is a colleague of Steinach's named\r\nLichtenstern, who has operated on numerous men and women with apparent\r\nsuccess. There has not been time yet to measure how long their new lease\r\nof life is to be; but they have regained the joy of life they had\r\nlost--strength and powers of work. Still, all this needs confirming.\r\n\r\nIn a rat it is the sexual impulses that are directly reanimated. He\r\nagain knows the fevers of courtship, the conflicts of marriage; and\r\nwhether he is glad to repeat these commotions depends on the rat. In\r\nman, however, the sexual impulses are more or less sublimated, so that\r\nthe new energy may appear in any of the other forms of psychic activity.\r\nWhatever such faculties he has in him once more grow strong.\r\n\r\n   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nHow wonderful it would be if we could at least prolong certain\r\nlives--great writers like H. G. Wells and Conrad, great artists, great\r\ndoctors. But in practice, the men who would get hold of this would be\r\nJohn D. Rockefeller and W. J. Bryan. The rich uncle would walk in and\r\ntell his hopeless heirs he had been to see Steinach. Senators would live\r\nforever. The world would grow harder for youth.\r\n\r\nEven were we able to control all this, and reserve the boon for the\r\nbest, would it work? Say we did choose the right men--is it not too\r\nintimate a suggestion that we should set a man of science upon them,\r\nprepared with a little knife to slice one of their genital ducts? Men\r\nhave fought all these years for the right to live. Have they no right to\r\ndie? Must an old man who is needed by the public be condemned to live\r\non, his aged cells stirred and restirred while we glean his brains bare?\r\nSome Socrates of the future may yet envy that other his hemlock.\r\n\r\n   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nThis, we say it regretfully, is the end of Mr. Day's article. It is\r\nadmirable fooling. We will not pay his wit the poor compliment of taking\r\nhim seriously at the last and pointing out to him that it was Heine who\r\nsaid, \"Nobody loves life like an old man!\" There will be no need of\r\ninsistence to urge the old men, useful or useless, to submit to an\r\noperation to renew their youth. But it is to be hoped that they will\r\nnever be asked to submit to the cutting of the genital duct. It seems to\r\nthe writer that +The Athenaeum+ must have misconstrued Dr. Steinach's\r\nexperiments in some degree, inasmuch as it is difficult to conceive of\r\nthe operation of severing a genital duct as conducive to cell-formation.\r\nHowever, probably ligating is meant instead of severing. But this is not\r\nthe point really brought out by Mr. Day's clever article. The real point\r\nis, Is it likely that if Mr. John Jones takes Dr. Brinkley's goat-gland\r\noperation for the renewal of his youth, and thereby adds thirty years to\r\nhis life, and at the end of this thirty years of friskiness undergoes a\r\nsecond transplantation of glands, thereby gaining twenty years more, and\r\nat the end of this twenty years takes the operation a third time,\r\nsecuring a further lease of gaiety for ten years, will the final years\r\nof Mr. John Jones be years of acute psychic senility, as observed by Dr.\r\nSteinach in his rat? To the writer it seems a +non sequitur+. The cases\r\nare not parallel. The rejuvenated rat appears to regard his acquired\r\nvitality as impelling toward revelry and excess. It is necessary to\r\nemphasize the point that the pith and marrow of Dr. Brinkley's discovery\r\nis that since it is clearly shown that rejuvenation is accomplished by\r\nthe restoration of activity to the sex-glands, therefore the\r\npreservation of this rejuvenation MUST depend upon the CONSERVATION of\r\nthe seminal fluids, and cannot depend upon any other single factor\r\nwhatever. It has been already explained that Dr. Brinkley puts it out of\r\nthe power of the rejuvenated man to destroy the good that has come into\r\nhis life, and protects him against the danger of yielding too freely to\r\npassionate impulse, by preventing the escape of the rejuvenating agent.\r\nThe means of nourishing the body and brain being therefore insured as to\r\nsupply, it is not reasonable to suppose that the nerve-cells of the\r\nrejuvenated man can fail to receive their proper nourishment for many\r\nsucceeding years, and, passing by the rat as a fallacious parallel, we\r\ncannot see any good reason why the human body and brain, either under\r\nthe guidance of self-control, or surgically safeguarded against the\r\nwaste of excess, should not function at their best for fifty years of\r\nadded life, with very possibly another fifty added to that. The real\r\ncrux of the matter is the resistive quality of tissue, which is\r\napproximately 200 years for such organs as kidneys and heart, and, say,\r\n150 for nerve-substance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OPERATING ROOM AT THE BRINKLEY HOSPITAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA WEEK AT DR. BRINKLEY'S HOSPITAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer, approaching the age of 54, and finding himself in\r\nfirst-class physical and mental condition, except for a high blood\r\npressure, which was certainly the prelude to a later arterio-sclerosis,\r\ndecided that he would be doing himself a service, and put himself in a\r\nbetter position to write with some authority upon the effects of the\r\ngoat-glands, if he took the operation.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, April 16. 1921, Dr. Brinkley operated on him at the\r\nhospital, Milford, Kansas, transplanting the glands of a three-weeks old\r\nmale goat. He remained in bed Saturday and Sunday, got up and went for\r\nan auto drive on Monday, and passed an uneventful week at the hospital,\r\nreturning to Chicago on Saturday. He experienced a marked increase in\r\nmental energy, which might have shown itself also as increased physical\r\nenergy if it had been put to the test. This feeling of added pep, snap,\r\nenergy, or what you please to call it, could be psychological in its\r\norigin if it were not for the fact that it is continuous, with no\r\nset-backs. Every student of psychology is aware that auto-suggestion has\r\nthe power to bring out latent energy, raise the drooping spirits, and\r\ngenerate a feeling of well-being. But the student, if he is a reasonably\r\nclose observer, is also aware that these improved states of feeling have\r\nan annoying habit of being offset by corresponding periods of\r\ndepression, and though he may persist in his effort to lift himself out\r\nof the black moods with such success that he finally arrives at a higher\r\ntone-level mentally, with a corresponding physical improvement, there is\r\nindubitably a strong sense of effort needed for this good result. When,\r\ntherefore, the writer finds himself working long hours day after day\r\nwith no sense of mental fatigue, but a certain unusual gaiety of heart\r\naccompanying the successive days, as if life were on the whole rather a\r\nlark, he, being accurately introspective, and not easily deceived into\r\noptimistic conclusions, is forced to give the whole credit for this\r\nchange of spirit to the functioning of the new glands, and he is\r\nconfirmed in this conclusion by the fact that the high blood pressure,\r\nwhich was noticeable enough before the operation, cannot now, ten days\r\nafter the operation, be detected by him at all. Ten days is all too\r\nshort a time in which to write of details in a matter of this\r\nimportance. He expects to be able to confirm improvement in eyesight by\r\nthe middle of May, and will be in a position to speak at greater length\r\non the matter after the summer has passed. The intent of this chapter is\r\nto give a brief account of something he saw at Dr. Brinkley's hospital\r\nduring the week of his treatment.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks before his arrival a man suffering from locomotor ataxia had\r\nbeen carried in, unable to help himself at all. When the writer saw this\r\nman and talked with him he was up and dressed and walking about, without\r\na cane, and he left for home after a total stay of something less than\r\nthree weeks. In parting from him the doctor said, \"You are on the\r\nhigh-road to complete recovery. I expect to hear that you are getting\r\nstronger every day. Practice in walking will bring back to you the old\r\nconfidence and banish the helpless feeling that you are sure to fall.\r\nYou see that you can control the motions of your feet and legs now as\r\nyou could not before. Sensation has returned to the soles of your feet,\r\nand you can now turn yourself over in bed, which you could not do before\r\nwithout assistance. This means that the brain, spinal cord, muscles and\r\nwill are co-ordinating again. This means that the goat-glands are\r\nactively working, dissolving scar-tissue, and bringing you back to\r\nhealth. But it is asking a good deal of a pair of goat-glands to do as\r\nmuch as they must do in your case to bring about complete recovery.\r\nI would rather give them some extra assistance. If you will come back to\r\nme, therefore, next Fall, to this hospital, I will put two new\r\ngoat-glands into you; and I believe that with this extra help you will\r\ngo right through to a complete cure without any trouble. The operation\r\nwill not cost you a cent. I am anxious only to complete the good work.\r\nI may be wrong at that, and it is possible that the glands you have now\r\nwill be enough to do the work, but if they do not, come back here for\r\ntwo more next Fall. Don't forget.\"\r\n\r\nThis man had been everywhere for relief, and had taken every treatment\r\nknown for his disease, with no results whatever, as he told the writer.\r\n\"This is the first time for twelve years,\" he said, \"that I have had any\r\nfeeling in my feet. I am surely going to get well at last.\"\r\n\r\nIn another case of the same disease the patient, when he came to the\r\nhospital, was taking morphine daily to relieve the lightning-pains. He\r\ncould not stand upright with his eyes shut without falling, and if\r\nspoken to suddenly was likely to lose his balance and fall. He had not\r\nwalked without a cane for several years. Twenty-four hours after the\r\ngoat-gland operation he said that the pains had left him, and\r\nvoluntarily stopped the morphine. In two weeks he was walking five miles\r\nbefore breakfast, without a cane to help him. He left the hospital a\r\ncured man. There has never been a case of true locomotor ataxia cured by\r\nany means whatever, in the history of man, until this Kansas surgeon,\r\nDr. Brinkley, found the cure for it in this transplantation of\r\ngoat-glands. Ataxia is an after-math of syphilis, in ninety-nine cases\r\nout of a hundred, and it is a question, which no layman can solve,\r\nwhether the cause of the ataxia is in the disease, or in the mercurial\r\ntreatment used to combat the disease. Another age, following this, may\r\ndecide that the disease, syphilis, is less destructive of human tissue\r\nthan the cure, Mercury. However that may be, the fact remains that\r\ngoat-glands will cure Locomotor Ataxia, and they are apparently the only\r\nmeans of cure hitherto discovered.\r\n\r\nThe writer talked with some of the townspeople of Milford regarding Dr.\r\nBrinkley's work. Their attitude was detached, but on the whole\r\naffirmative. They could not, as they put it, doubt their own eyesight,\r\nimplying that they would do so if they could. They had seen case after\r\ncase carried into the hospital, and they had seen those same people walk\r\nout and go their way to their homes. It was queer, they said, and wagged\r\na critical head. So true is it in all parts of the earth that a prophet\r\nhath honor save in his own country! Here and there, however, the writer\r\nfound a townsman who had nothing but words of praise and admiration for\r\nDr. Brinkley's work. These always proved to be people who had had some\r\nrelative under Dr. Brinkley's care at the hospital, and they were\r\nintelligent men who could give their reasons for their conclusions. They\r\nwere proud of the lustre which Dr. Brinkley's Goat-Gland work was\r\nshedding upon the name of their village. Most of the townspeople,\r\nhowever, seemed to think that Dr. Brinkley should be proud of the town.\r\nTheir engaging surliness of demeanor with regard to the miracles being\r\nperformed in their village was a fascinating study to a city man, who\r\nsaw here at its best the typical small-town attitude towards the big\r\nlocal thing. It is not peculiar to Milford. It is universal. It is as\r\ntrue in England and France and Belgium and Germany as in any little town\r\nin the United States. What do you suppose the country villagers thought\r\nof Fabre, the great French naturalist, probably to be hailed by the next\r\ngeneration as the greatest figure since Darwin? Without doubt they\r\nthought him mad, and if kindly, pitied him, or if savage, despised him.\r\nMeanwhile it is quite certain that the work of Dr. Brinkley has put the\r\ntown of Milford, Kansas, on the map, and, if you do not find it on the\r\nrailroad map you may some day consult, it will help a little to say here\r\nthat you go from Kansas City, Missouri, by the Union Pacific Railroad to\r\nJunction City, Kansas, and from that point change to a little branch\r\nline which carries you to Milford. The depot at Milford is about a mile\r\nfrom the village itself. You will find an auto at the depot which will\r\ncarry you to the hospital, where you will be met by Dr. or Mrs.\r\nBrinkley, or Miss Lewis, the Head Nurse, and where you will be very\r\ncomfortable if you decide to make a stay of a week or so for personal\r\nreasons. The food is good, and the Kansas air fresh and bracing and\r\nplentiful. Winds are indeed common, but the village is safely out of the\r\ntrack of the Kansas cyclones, and the storm cellar is unknown. The\r\nhospital is spotlessly clean and a marvel of completeness in equipment.\r\nThe preparations for the gland transplantation are simple but thorough;\r\na test of spermatic fluid, a blood test, a test for blood pressure,\r\na blood count, and a purgative the night before the operation, with no\r\nbreakfast on the morning of the operation. You will eat a good lunch in\r\nbed, however, on that day, and miss no meals afterwards. Briefly, the\r\nwriter can say honestly that the pain of the operation is no more than\r\nthe twinge of a toothache.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Brinkley's employment of the goat-glands for the past three years of\r\ncontinuous operating, therefore, has proved to his satisfaction and to\r\nthat of his patients that the testes in men and the ovaries in women\r\nfurnish a secretion which has the property of a revivifying fluid when\r\nrestored to the system by the currents of blood and lymph. In that\r\ncommonly fatal condition of the arteries which follows rapidly upon the\r\nstate of blood pressure known as hardening of the arteries, or\r\narterio-sclerosis, a practically incurable condition hitherto, the\r\nresults obtained by the goat-gland transplantation are miraculously\r\nswift. When the arteries are, as the doctor puts it, \"as hard as\r\npipe-stems,\" they grow in a few weeks, sometimes in a week, soft and\r\npliable. The change, according to Dr. Brinkley, is brought about in the\r\nwalls of the arteries themselves, and is not a process of dissolving the\r\naccumulations or deposits of calcareous material within the arteries.\r\nThe change is in the material of the walls of the arteries, producing a\r\nreturn of the condition of elasticity, permitting expansion and\r\ncontraction as in youth.\r\n\r\nIt is a favorite theory with some modern writers that the physical\r\nchange from youth to age is accompanied in the body, and in a sense\r\ncaused by, the deterioration in the quality of the cells of the body,\r\nand they call this change a breaking-down process by which the finer and\r\nmore highly differentiated cells, such, for example, as the nerve-cells,\r\nand others which have high and complicated duties to perform, are\r\ndisplaced by cells of an inferior type, which they name conjunctive\r\ncells, much as the common sparrow drives away the songbirds from the\r\nhome garden and, usurping the place of the songbird, substitutes a\r\nwretched twitter for the golden notes of the warblers which once\r\ndelighted our ears. The common cells, also, on usurping the place of the\r\nnobler cells, are unable to perform the difficult duties of the latter,\r\nand the result upon human organism is disorder, decay, disease, etc.,\r\ncontributing to, if not causing, the condition of old age. This is an\r\ningenious but not convincing theory. Our knowledge of histological\r\nprocesses is too incomplete at this stage to permit its acceptance as\r\nfact. It assumes too much to be known which is quite unknown. Moreover,\r\nit refutes itself upon examination in this particular, and in several\r\nothers, that if it were true that these inferior cells are on the\r\nlookout to invade instantly any part of the human organism in which\r\nthere was a breaking down of nerve-tissue, for example, then it would be\r\nimpossible to build new nerve-tissue to take the place of that which was\r\ndestroyed, because its place, according to this theory, has been already\r\ntaken by an intruder who cannot be dislodged. But new nerve-cells are\r\nconstantly being rebuilt, and constantly being put to use in the\r\norganism. If this theory were true, then a brain in middle age would be\r\nunable to function because of the impossibility of renewing its cells.\r\n\r\nA much more reasonable and probably true explanation of the cause of old\r\nage is the gradual disappearance of animal matter in the bones and\r\ntissues, and the corresponding increase of the mineral matter in the\r\nbones and tissues, amounting to ossification of cartilage, whereby the\r\nsupple cartilage, losing its animal content, becomes practically bone by\r\ndeposit of lime particles. This would also account in a common-sense\r\nmanner for the fragility of the bones of the aged, the brittleness being\r\ndue to calcareous deposits in the substance of the bone itself, in\r\nexcess of the normal mineral contents of the bones in youth. The\r\nfunction of the seminal fluids, therefore, appears to be to restore to\r\nthe aging tissues this property, this animal matter, which when in its\r\nright ratio and proportion in the cells of the organism produces the\r\ncondition of youth. The action of these seminal fluids, therefore, seems\r\nto be two-fold, a dissolving and a nourishing. The distinction should be\r\nclearly made that the action is NOT merely stimulating. The stimulation\r\nof a nerve-cell is a temporary excitement. We speak of the stimulation\r\nof alcohol, and this illustration gives a clearer view of the difference\r\nbetween the nourishing action of the seminal fluids and a stimulating\r\naction than we could obtain by the employment of many words. It is\r\ninteresting to remember that while it is possible to increase the\r\nmineral particles of soda, potash, lime, iron, silica and magnesia in\r\nthe blood and lymph, it is practically impossible for us to increase the\r\nanimal contents of the cells by any method of medication or dieting\r\nknown to us. Only Life can produce this change in the cells, and only\r\nthis method of gland-transplantation has furnished a means of impressing\r\nLife into service to work for us in this matter. To produce the effects\r\nwhich are needed to rejuvenate a body that has increased its mineral\r\nmatter at the expense of its animal matter we require the co-operation\r\nof glands made active, because only the glands, in the marvelous\r\nchemistry of the body, are able to compound the animal substances\r\nrequired to nourish the cells, tissues and organs of the body, and to\r\ndissolve and remove those injurious substances of a mineral nature which\r\nhave accumulated in excess in cells and tissues, usurping the place of\r\nthe animal matter in the cells because of the inactivity of function\r\ngenerally, and the poor elimination of waste matter, as the years pass.\r\nThis is the re-creative and rejuvenating work of the gland secretions.\r\nIt is beyond us to say exactly what these secretions consist of. We know\r\nthe importance of their presence in blood and lymph only by the\r\ndisasters that follow their absence. The thyroid gland and parathyroids,\r\nfor instance, seem to be connected by some close sympathy with the\r\nactivity or non-activity of the interstitial glands, and the atrophy of\r\none is often accompanied by the atrophy of the other. The subject is\r\nstill hidden in darkness to the extent of insufficient knowledge on our\r\npart of the exact constituents of the active agents in the secretions of\r\nthe testes, thyroids, suprarenals, pituitary and other glands. Time and\r\nfurther opportunity for experiment are needed to show to what extent the\r\ngoat-gland transplantation can be used to remedy goitre, epilepsy and\r\nthe graver lesions of paralysis. The use of the goat-glands is too\r\nrecent to admit of anything but speculation on these points. There would\r\nseem to be no good reason to doubt that if the male organs of a young\r\ngoat do rejuvenate the atrophied testes of a man, which Dr. Brinkley has\r\nabundantly proved they do, the thyroid gland of a young goat might be\r\nexpected to restore the atrophied thyroid of a human being. This again\r\nis only conjecture, Dr. Brinkley's work up to the present having been\r\nconfined to the transplantation of testes and ovaries. But he expects to\r\nfind time during the present year to satisfy himself of the results of\r\nsuch important experimental work as is here indicated. It is possible\r\nthat his visit to Europe this summer may be the means of enlarging his\r\nfield considerably, although it would appear that if he had six pairs of\r\nhands and could keep all employed in continuous service he could\r\nscarcely cope with the demands upon his time which any and all countries\r\nof the earth may be expected to make when his work is known. In ten\r\nyears, no doubt, gland-transplantation, particularly goat-gland\r\ntransplantation, for the renewal of youth in man and woman will be so\r\nusual as to occasion neither wonder nor hilarity. But we are not living\r\nten years from now, but at this present moment, and Dr. Brinkley's\r\noperation to-day is a marvel, a wonder and a joy. There is a\r\nsatisfaction in being in the van. It is fine to be the first to do a big\r\nthing, especially if that big thing is something of the most practical\r\nvalue to humanity. Mankind has always crowned its great generals, its\r\ngreat destroyers of life. Here is a man who comes forward to preserve\r\nlife. That is his mission, if you like. Certainly it is his life work.\r\nIt is a noble work. The question in the writer's mind is, What will they\r\ndo to him? How will they take him in England? Will they applaud, or\r\ncrucify, or neglect? Probably they will show him something of the\r\ngenerous hospitality of England, and leaven this with a plentiful\r\nsprinkling of ridicule, because the subject of the goat lends itself to\r\nhumor of the obvious kind. But it is our belief that the hard, practical\r\ncommon sense of the Anglo-Saxon will lead them to make the utmost use of\r\nthis opportunity of his visit, and, having got him, it is to be expected\r\nthat they will know enough to keep him. This is quite as much their\r\nopportunity as his. While they sharpen their wit upon the sacrificial\r\ngoat and make merry, they are pretty sure to make full use of his\r\nknowledge and skill while they have him with them, and might make things\r\nso pleasant for him that he might say, when the summer is over and he\r\nlooks back upon the white cliffs of Dover, returning to his own country,\r\n\"This is a good land. I have enjoyed the trip. I like the people. I will\r\nreturn next summer, and for many summers thereafter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE SPARK OF LIFE\r\n\r\n  +By J. R. Brinkley, M.D., C.M., Ph.D., Sc.D.+\r\n\r\n  Chief Surgeon, Brinkley-Jones Hospital and Training School\r\n  for Nurses, Milford, Kansas\r\n\r\n\r\n  (Written October, 1920)\r\n\r\nFor many years scientists have believed that a part, or all of the\r\nglands of the human body influenced longevity. They believed our glands\r\ncontained the \"life spark.\" Men for hundreds of years have been seeking\r\nthe \"fountain of youth.\" Ponce de Leon when he landed in Florida and saw\r\nthe beautiful springs and flowers thought he had found it, and so\r\nannounced to the world. Long ago we learned that the pituitary gland\r\ninfluenced growth and development. For instance if the pituitary gland\r\nover-functioned we had Giantism. If it under-functioned the opposite was\r\nthe result--a dwarf. If the thyroid gland was at fault we would have\r\neither the low mentality commonly spoken of as cretinism, or myxedema.\r\nWe found that by feeding children the fresh gland substance a marked\r\nimprovement would be obtained and sometimes a cure. Some years ago there\r\nwas a surgical craze which called for the removal of the women's\r\novaries. It was thought that many nervous troubles, including epilepsy,\r\netc., were due to diseased ovaries, so the surgeons removed ovaries just\r\nabout as promiscuously as tonsils and teeth are now taken out. After a\r\nwhile they found a woman without ovaries was about ruined, so something\r\nhad to be done, and ovarian extracts and substances were fed to the\r\nunfortunates. Good results were obtained so long as the feeding process\r\nkept up, but if the feeding was stopped, the miserable symptoms\r\nreturned. One factor was always in evidence, that a woman who had no\r\novaries never menstruated again. Premature change of life (menopause)\r\nresulted. Ageing took place early. A loss of interest in the pleasant\r\nthings of life existed. As a wife or companion for the home the woman\r\nwas worse than useless. Her life was so miserable that all who came in\r\ncontact with her were made miserable, also. She was unsexed, and one of\r\nthe \"sparks of life\" had been taken away. She assumed characteristics of\r\nthe male. If the testes of a man are removed he will assume the\r\ncharacteristics of a woman. Many changes will take place. His mind is no\r\nlonger clear, he tires easily, cannot concentrate upon any subject, and\r\nhas marked loss of memory and of physical well being. The things that\r\nonce appealed to him are now undesirable. The opposite sex are repulsive\r\nand he shuns their society. A man or woman who suffers the premature\r\nloss of their glands of regeneration will become more or less defective\r\nmentally and their life will be materially shortened.\r\n\r\nAt one time a favorite expression was, \"A man is as old as his\r\narteries.\" We know better than this now. A man is just as old as he\r\nfeels, when said feeling is directed to his sex organs. The first sign\r\nof old age is impotency, and more men are reaching a premature impotency\r\nthan ever before in the history of the world. Their glands are burning\r\nup, as it were. After impotency is well on its way arterio-sclerosis or\r\nhardening of the arteries is noticed, then the mental inefficiency, as\r\nwell as physical weakness. Right on the heels of impotency comes\r\nprostatitis. I was taught in medical school that nearly all men suffered\r\nfrom an enlarged prostate and prostatitis: that it was one of the\r\ndiseases of \"old age\"; that we were heir to it and might expect it to\r\nshow up after the age of 45. I was also taught that arterio-sclerosis\r\nwas another disease of old age, and all men were heir to it. However, we\r\nare beginning to awaken to a few things. We are approaching the dawn of\r\na new day. We are beginning to understand the whys and wherefores. While\r\nI have been criticized and called everything under the sun, except an\r\nangel, I expected as much, and I am ready to face the world with my\r\nfacts; not theories. I have a long and hard fight before me yet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOGGENBURG GOATS]\r\n\r\nThe cures that I have effected by gland transplantation up to the\r\npresent time are enough to justify me for all of my work and efforts\r\nalong this new line of science. Should I never operate again, I feel\r\njustly repaid and know that I have started something that will go on and\r\non and live forever. Gland transplantation for the cure of disease\r\nwithin the next ten years will be as common as the removal of a diseased\r\nappendix is now. You can hardly pick up a daily paper without reading an\r\naccount of some surgeon performing a wonderful operation of\r\ntransplanting bone or tissue from some animal to replace that which was\r\ndiseased in the human. Why not borrow what we need from the animal? We\r\nuse their flesh for food. We also use their gland substances in the\r\nfresh or dried form to supply our bodies with whatever we may not\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nMy first efforts in gland transplantation were directed towards the cure\r\nof sterility. A man came to me who had been impotent for sixteen years.\r\nEvery known means had been used in his case. My experiments in the use\r\nof glands from animal to animal, led me to believe that if the gland\r\nfrom a goat could be transplanted into the human body this impotency and\r\nsterility could be overcome. This man was willing to try anything as he\r\nwas 46 and his wife was 42. They were very anxious for a male child.\r\nTwelve months after the transplantation I delivered his wife of a\r\n10-pound baby boy, who is alive and well today. In appreciation of what\r\nthe goat glands had done for them they named the baby \"Billy.\" He lives\r\nwithin four miles of me now. This first case being a wonderful success\r\nencouraged me to experiment with humans on a larger scale. Willing\r\nsubjects were not easy to obtain. After obtaining, it was difficult to\r\noperate. The operation or experiment could not be performed in any of\r\nthe general hospitals. Ethics as well as country and little town gossip\r\nforbid such work. It was necessary for me to build a hospital of my own\r\nso that my experiments could be carried on without the public or\r\nprofession knowing anything about them. If good results were obtained I\r\ncould announce to the world; if none were obtained the matter could be\r\ndropped. After four male children had been born, due directly to gland\r\ntransplantation, the news leaked out, and has swept the world like\r\nwildfire. While I was transplanting glands for sterility, other\r\nbeneficial effects were noted by me as well as my patients. Now, since I\r\nhave transplanted glands into more than 600 men and women it is an easy\r\nmatter to give some comprehensive statistics. A complete record is kept\r\nof each case and follow-up letters are used so that we are in a pretty\r\nfair way to estimate just what we are doing. Five cases of insanity have\r\nbeen cured to date. The great difficulty in obtaining insane people for\r\noperation is, they are confined in a state institution, and the\r\nauthorities will not permit their removal, especially when their loved\r\nones tell the \"higher ups\" they wish Dr. Brinkley, \"the gland man,\" to\r\ntransplant goat glands. \"Oh, no, it's all rot and will never do!\"\r\nHowever, we have operated upon five cases and have cured five cases.\r\nAfter awhile we will break down this great wall of prejudice, and insane\r\npeople will be ordered out for this operation. At present when habeas\r\ncorpus proceedings are all that will obtain the release, and gland\r\ntransplantation is the object, not much of a chance exists. I am going\r\nto mention one of our very interesting cases, as the man lives only\r\nabout 15 or 20 miles from me in Dickinson County, Kansas. His name is\r\nLon Jones, and his case is known far and wide within the state of\r\nKansas. My writing about Mr. Jones will not be the betrayal of a\r\nprofessional secret. He is anxious for the world to know about it. Some\r\nsix weeks or two months before I was called to see him he was stricken\r\nsuddenly, insane. He had mounted his horse and was driving his cattle\r\nhome for the night when it was noticed by others that he acted \"queer.\"\r\nHe began to whip and fight his steed as well as the cattle unmercifully.\r\nHe dismounted or fell off his horse and at first was thought\r\nunconscious. A physician was called, another, and another, and his case\r\nwas diagnosed as Dementia Praecox. Violent in character. He wanted to\r\nkill his doctor, or commit some rash act. One of the first acts was to\r\ntry and give away all of his land and stock as well as corn and feed.\r\n\r\nIt was unsafe for his wife and children to be near him. Men remained\r\nwith him, day and night. Finally his guards had to tie him in bed. His\r\narms and feet were securely fastened, as well as his body, to a heavy\r\niron bed. Application for his entry into the state institution had been\r\nmade when I was called. With the assistance of neighbor men he was\r\nconducted into my hospital here. Immediate gland transplantation was\r\nperformed, and three days after said operation he asked me to remove his\r\nirons so that he could rest comfortably. He informed me that he was in\r\nhis right mind and we need have no further fear of him. Soon afterwards\r\nhe was permitted to roam around the building and over town. He went home\r\nmore than a year ago and is transacting his business as a sane man\r\nshould. No evidence of his former trouble has occurred. He did not know\r\nuntil the day that we discharged him what my line of treatment had been.\r\nAnother notable case was that of a man who had spent 11 years of his\r\nlife in three state institutions for the insane in New York. He left\r\nhere entirely cured and is now holding an important position in New York\r\nCity. Another case was that of a young man who became insane suddenly.\r\nHis first act was to try and murder his father and mother, his greatest\r\nbitterness being directed towards his mother. He attempted to kill me\r\nwhen I approached him, and it was necessary to open a bottle of\r\nchloroform and stand at a safe distance and throw the anesthetic in his\r\nface and eyes. Less than a week after the operation he was in his right\r\nmind, and has been so since. Another case of a young man who became\r\ninsane and was violent. He secured a number of rifles and shotguns and\r\nbarricaded himself in a corn field. When he learned I had been sent for\r\nhe was worse than ever, and if it had not been for his mother I would\r\nhave been killed. I operated upon him immediately, and for one week\r\nafter the operation I could not visit him. However, he soon was in his\r\nright mind, and when it was told to him what he had done he went to\r\nIndianapolis, Ind., and secured a position. His shame was so great that\r\nhe could not remain where he was known. After two years he returned home\r\nand resumed work where he had left off. The fifth case was just as\r\ninteresting as the above.\r\n\r\nI have operated upon and cured 5 cases of locomotor-ataxia. It is almost\r\nimpossible for me to get cases of locomotor-ataxia. When a man writes me\r\nhe also asks his family physician, who very quickly informs him \"there\r\nis nothing to it; it's all bunk!\"\r\n\r\nMy cases have ranged in age from 18 to 75 years. My patients that are\r\nfrom 60 to 75 years of age write me they feel as they did when they were\r\nboys 18 years of age. I have transplanted glands for almost every\r\nconceivable disease and have received splendid results in almost every\r\ncase. All cannot be cured, but all of them can be greatly benefited. At\r\nthis writing I have with me as a patient a noted United States Senator\r\nfrom Washington, D.C. He has been treated by Dr. Cary T. Grayson, the\r\npresident's personal physician, as well as taking 3 years of treatment\r\nat Johns Hopkins Hospital. He is depressed and discouraged. He speaks of\r\nsuicide. He has been operated on only two days and I venture to say that\r\nbefore his week is passed he will be a different man.\r\n\r\nMy greatest number of men come for impotency, next for prostatitis, and\r\nmany for a general improvement in health. Many come with but one\r\npurpose--to prolong their lives. I believe that those who receive gland\r\ntransplantation will live much longer than without it. Possibly as much\r\nas from 10 to 25 years can be added. Then successive transplants can be\r\nmade, and we have no idea how long they will live. Their skin takes on\r\nthe appearance of youth. I know that after the ovaries have been\r\ntransplanted into women who have none their menses return on a 4-day\r\nperiod regularly. Women who had passed the menopause have a return flow.\r\nHardening of the arteries as well as high blood pressure are returned to\r\nnormal in 100 per cent of the cases. Eyesight is improved from 50 to 100\r\nper cent. A well-known judge was operated upon by me a short time ago,\r\nand his eyesight was so much improved that he could no longer wear\r\nglasses of any kind. Men who had not heard for 16 years write me that\r\nsince gland transplantation they can hear the tick of a watch. In women\r\na development of the bust is noted and the wrinkles disappear from their\r\ncheeks. Chronic constipation is cured as well as old chronic skin\r\ndiseases, such as psoriasis, eczema, etc.\r\n\r\nWith the best will in the world I am unable to describe on paper just\r\nhow my fellow practitioners should perform this operation, because I\r\nnever meet with precisely similar conditions in any two cases. I can say\r\npositively that I do not know just what I shall do until the case itself\r\nis under my hands in the operating room. The operation is simple in\r\nitself, but in my early days of operating I made a number of mistakes\r\nbecause I was on new ground, and there was no authority from whom I\r\ncould learn the technique. Now, after my six hundred operations have\r\ntaught me what to do and how to do I am able to avoid these earlier\r\nmistakes, and as a consequence I hardly ever have an operation that is\r\nnot a success. Not very many months ago I was called to San Francisco to\r\nre-operate on a number of cases which had gone wrong in the hands of a\r\nfellow practitioner. I re-operated on these cases successfully. The\r\nsurgeon who had performed the operation in the first place is skilful\r\nand experienced in all lines of surgical work, but in this particular\r\nline of transplanting of goat-glands into human bodies in such wise that\r\nthe tissue of the goat will blend with and nourish the human tissue no\r\nliving man except myself has had the necessary experience to teach him\r\nthrough his successes and failures, what to do and how to do it. Nor\r\nshould I be successful if today, in spite of all the work I have done\r\nwith the Goat-Glands, I should relinguish the goat-gland in favor of the\r\nhuman-gland or the monkey-gland. Results have taught me that I made a\r\nwise choice in pinning my faith to the young goat as the healthiest\r\npossible animal from which tissue could be used for transplanting into\r\nhuman bodies. The goat is immune to practically all diseases. The human\r\nbeing and the monkey, on the other hand, are liable to tuberculous or\r\nsome tropical disease. For his splendid work with human glands I give\r\nfull credit to Dr. Frank Lydston of Chicago, who was not only the\r\npioneer in this use of human glands, but actually made his first\r\ntransplantation upon himself. This is but another instance of that fine\r\nconfidence in our beliefs and convictions which is typical of the\r\nmedical profession as a whole. In the use of the human-gland Dr. Lydston\r\nis as supreme as I am in the use of the goat-gland, and you must\r\nunderstand that in saying this I am not throwing bouquets at myself in\r\nidle vanity. I have a clear cold reason for saying this. I have devoted\r\nmy life to this particular work, and have brought it to a point where I\r\ncan speak with authority upon it. I foresee that because of the\r\nmarvelous results obtained by the transplanting of the goat-glands at my\r\nhospital there will be a great awakening of interest in this operation\r\non the part of the public and the medical profession. A great many\r\noperations of a similar character will be performed not alone in this\r\ncountry, but all over the world. A great many of these operations will\r\nbe unsuccessful because the experience of the operator will not have\r\ntaught him what to do under certain unusual conditions, or rather, what\r\nto do under any and all conditions. In the face of an unsuccessful\r\noperation this work will be blamed, and the theory upon which I work,\r\nnamely, that the sex-energy is the basis of all human energy, physical\r\nand mental, will be given a setback, and scouted as untrue. But I am\r\nconstantly proving its truth by the results I get, and find its\r\nconfirmation in the effect of successful goat-gland transplantation in\r\nboth men and women. Therefore I am urgent in saying that the work must\r\nbe rightly done in the first place to obtain right results.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the operation for men means that the glands of a three weeks'\r\nold male goat are laid upon the non-functioning glands of a man, within\r\ntwenty minutes of the time they are removed from the goat. In some cases\r\nI open the human gland and lay the tissue of the goat within the human\r\ngland. The scrotum of the man is opened by incision on both sides under\r\nlocal anesthetic. Conditions of the case may show that there are\r\nadhesions of tissue which must also be broken down before the new gland\r\ncan function. I find that after being properly connected these\r\ngoat-glands do actually feed, grow into, and become absorbed by the\r\nhuman glands, and the man is renewed in his physical and mental vigor.\r\n\r\nThe operation upon women means that the ovaries of a female goat not\r\nmore than twelve months of age are removed and inserted into the woman.\r\nIf the woman's organs are sound and merely inert and atrophied, the new\r\novary will find its way to its proper position and begin the work of\r\nrestoring the arrested functions, so that the act of menstruation, for\r\nexample, which has ceased because of the atrophic condition of the\r\nwoman's ovaries, begins again and continues on a normal twenty-eight day\r\nperiod. The effect of the new glands upon women is even more noticeable,\r\nif such a thing were possible, than upon men, since in their case the\r\nrejuvenation is more striking in the changed appearance. But though I\r\nclaim much, and with good reason, for this operation, I warn against\r\nundue expectations. In many cases I advise against the operation as a\r\nsure waste of time and money. In many cases I explain that the results\r\nwill be experimental only, there being nothing in my experience to\r\nwarrant assurance of success. For instance, in blindness and deafness I\r\nhave no faith that this operation will remove the disease in spite of\r\nthe fact that in almost every case operated upon there is great\r\nimprovement in the sight and hearing. But I have no certain knowledge\r\nwhy this improvement followed. It partakes, therefore, of the nature of\r\nan accident. In the case of very fat people the operation trims them\r\ndown to normal weight. Very thin people are built up to normal weight by\r\nit. Barren women and impotent men become mothers and fathers. But in no\r\ncase do I permit a grandfather or grandmother to entertain the hope that\r\nthey may be rejuvenated to such an extent that they can procreate again\r\nif they wish. This is mere romance, with which I have nothing to do. Nor\r\ndo I advise a young woman of forty who has not reached the menopause\r\nstage to take the operation if she is in good health, in spite of her\r\nbelief that the goat-glands will enable her to remain indefinitely\r\nyoung. This is experimental work, and is not in the same class as the\r\ncase of the same woman who has just passed through her menopause and\r\nceased to menstruate. By all means I advise the latter to take the\r\noperation because I feel that it will rejuvenate her. If a woman has had\r\nboth ovaries removed by surgical operation, will this operation grow new\r\novaries for her, and enable her to become a mother? At this stage of my\r\nknowledge my answer is, \"Certainly not.\" If a man has lost both glands\r\nby surgical removal will this operation grow new glands for him? Nine\r\ntimes out of ten, \"No.\" The tenth time, \"Yes.\" I do not know why.\r\n\r\nI can use only a certain breed of goat, a Swiss milk goat, and only\r\nanimals of a certain youth. My goats cost me about $75 each on an\r\naverage, and that is one reason why it would be impossible to conduct\r\nthis work as a free surgical clinic might be conducted, unless the\r\nundertaking were specially endowed with funds to meet the expense.\r\n\r\nSome time in the month of June I expect to make a trip to London,\r\nEngland, and will be away possibly until the end of August. Even the\r\nmonth of May in Kansas is sometimes too hot for this operation to be\r\nsuccessfully performed, and I make it a rule to suspend operations\r\nentirely throughout June, July and August. Experience has taught me that\r\nwhen the outdoor temperature is high the operation will almost certainly\r\nbe unsuccessful, and on account of the cost involved, as well as for the\r\nsaving of time and trouble for the patient, it is in the highest degree\r\nunwise to go contrary to this rule. If the glands are transplanted\r\nduring very hot weather they will almost certainly slough, which means\r\nre-operating later.\r\n\r\nIn many cases that are brought to me I do not operate or even advise\r\nthat the goat-glands be transplanted later. I cannot go into details of\r\nsuch cases in these pages, but might cite the case of a man, syphilitic,\r\nwho was sent to me. Certainly I have never made the statement anywhere,\r\nat any time, that this operation would cure syhpilis. The man is being\r\ntreated now for syphilis, and should not have been sent to me at all.\r\n\r\nI quote the case of a woman of forty, who is normal in every way, and\r\nthe picture of health at the present time. Her desire is that she may\r\nnever grow to look any older than she does at this moment, and she asks\r\nme if this gland-operation will hold her at the point she has now\r\nreached. Frankly, this is pure experiment. I do not know. After another\r\nten years of work in this gland-surgery I might be able to give her a\r\ndefinite opinion, but not at this stage, seeing that my oldest cases go\r\nback only three years. On one point only I can speak with positiveness,\r\nnamely, if I cannot answer this question there is no man living who can\r\nanswer it, because I am the only man alive who can give an opinion on\r\nthis work that is founded on first-hand knowledge. We learn in this work\r\nonly by experience, and we draw just conclusions only from +quantity+ of\r\nexperience. No other man alive has had this experience in sufficient\r\nquantity to justify him in forming a conclusion derived from his facts.\r\nThis is my answer not only to those who listen to encouraging advice\r\nregarding the effects of this operation tendered by surgeons who are\r\nembarking in this goat-gland operation, but also to those general\r\npractitioners who inform patients asking their opinion in the matter\r\nthat the operation is useless because the glands are certain to slough,\r\nI hold that they are not qualified to speak on the subject because they\r\nhave no knowledge. I have the most positive knowledge that when the\r\noperation is rightly performed the glands do NOT slough, and my\r\nknowledge is founded upon the hard facts of much experience. In another\r\nten years I shall know more than I know today because I shall have added\r\nto my facts, and among those facts there may be some which confirm the\r\nhope of the woman of forty alluded to above that this gland\r\ntransplantation may hold the condition of youth steady as something\r\nstatic, which will not be suffered to pass. At present I do not know,\r\nand if I offer an opinion it is to be understood that it is only a\r\nguess. My guess, then, would be that in this case the operation would be\r\na waste, producing no effect whatever, neither adding to nor detracting\r\nfrom the condition of health and normal function which is present today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n           *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe One Best Way Series of New Thought Books.
