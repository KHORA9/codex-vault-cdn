All these strive towards a common end, a perfect\r\nunderstanding of the vegetable kingdom, but they differ entirely from\r\none another in their methods of research, and therefore presuppose\r\nessentially different intellectual endowments. That this is the case\r\nis abundantly shown by the history of the science, from which we learn\r\nthat up to quite recent times morphology and classification have\r\ndeveloped in almost entire independence of the other two branches.\r\nPhytotomy has indeed always maintained a certain connection with\r\nphysiology, but where principles peculiar to each of them, fundamental\r\nquestions, had to be dealt with, there they also went their way in\r\nalmost entire independence of one another. It is only in the present\r\nday that a deeper conception of the problems of vegetable life has led\r\nto a closer union between the three. I have sought to do justice to\r\nthis historical fact by treating the parts of my subject separately;\r\nbut in this case, if the present work was to be kept within suitable\r\nlimits, it became necessary to devote a strictly limited space only\r\nto each of the three historical delineations. It is obvious that the\r\nweightiest and most important matter only could find a place in so\r\nnarrow a frame, but this I do not exactly regard as a misfortune,\r\nand in the interests of the reader it is rather an advantage; for, in\r\naccordance with the objects of the ‘General History of the Sciences,’\r\nthis History of Botany is not intended for professional persons only,\r\nbut for a wider circle of readers, and to these perhaps even the\r\ndetails presented in it may here and there seem wearisome.\r\n\r\nThe style of the narrative might have been freer, and greater space\r\nmight have been allotted to reflections on the inner connection of\r\nthe whole subject, if I had had before me better preliminary studies\r\nin the history of botany; but as things are, I have found myself\r\nespecially occupied in ascertaining questions of historical fact, in\r\ndistinguishing true merit from undeserved reputation, in searching\r\nout the first beginnings of fruitful thoughts and observing their\r\ndevelopment, and in more than one case in producing lengthy refutations\r\nof wide-spread errors. These things could not be done within the\r\nallotted space without a certain dryness of style and manner, and I\r\nhave often been obliged to content myself with passing allusions where\r\ndetailed explanation might have been desired.\r\n\r\nAs regards the choice of topics, I have given prominence to discoveries\r\nof facts only when they could be shown to have promoted the development\r\nof the science; on the other hand, I have made it my chief object to\r\ndiscover the first dawning of scientific ideas and to follow them as\r\nthey developed into comprehensive theories, for in this lies, to my\r\nmind, the true history of a science. But the task of the historian of\r\nBotany, as thus conceived, is a very difficult one, for it is only with\r\ngreat labour that he succeeds in picking the real thread of scientific\r\nthought out of an incredible chaos of empirical material. It has\r\nalways been the chief hindrance to a more rapid advance in botany, that\r\nthe majority of writers simply collected facts, or if they attempted\r\nto apply them to theoretical purposes, did so very imperfectly. I have\r\ntherefore singled out those men as the true heroes of our story who\r\nnot only established new facts, but gave birth to fruitful thoughts\r\nand made a speculative use of empirical material. From this point of\r\nview I have taken ideas only incidentally thrown out for nothing more\r\nthan they were originally; for scientific merit belongs only to the\r\nman who clearly recognises the theoretical importance of an idea, and\r\nendeavours to make use of it for the promotion of his science. For this\r\nreason I ascribe little value, for instance, to certain utterances of\r\nearlier writers, whom it is the fashion at present to put forward as\r\nthe first founders of the theory of descent; for it is an indubitable\r\nfact that the theory of descent had no scientific value before the\r\nappearance of Darwin’s book in 1859, and that it was Darwin who gave\r\nit that value. Here, as in other cases, it appears to me only true\r\nand just to abstain from assigning to earlier writers merits to which\r\nprobably, if they were alive, they would themselves lay no claim.\r\n\r\n                                                    J. SACHS.\r\n\r\n WÜRZBURG, _July 22, 1875_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR’S PREFACE\r\n\r\n_To the English translation of the History of Botany of Julius von\r\nSachs._\r\n\r\n\r\nI am gratefully sensible of the honourable distinction implied in\r\nthe determination of the Delegates of the Clarendon Press to have\r\nmy History of Botany translated into the world-wide language of the\r\nBritish Empire. Fourteen years have elapsed since the first appearance\r\nof the work in Germany, from fifteen to eighteen years since it\r\nwas composed,—a period of time usually long enough in our age of\r\nrapid progress for a scientific work to become obsolete. But if the\r\npreparation of an English translation shows that competent judges do\r\nnot regard the book as obsolete, I should be inclined to refer this to\r\ntwo causes. First of all, no other work of a similar kind has appeared,\r\nas far as I know, since 1875, so that mine may still be considered to\r\nbe, in spite of its age, the latest history of Botany; secondly, it\r\nhas been my endeavour to ascertain the historical facts by careful and\r\ncritical study of the older botanical literature in the original works,\r\nat the cost indeed of some years of working-power and of considerable\r\ndetriment to my health, and facts never lose their value,—a truth which\r\nEngland especially has always recognised.\r\n\r\nBut the present work is not a simple enumeration of the names of\r\nbotanists and of their writings, no mere list of the dates of botanical\r\ndiscoveries and theories; such was not at all my plan when I designed\r\nit. On the contrary I purposed to present to the reader a picture\r\nof the way in which the first beginnings of scientific study of the\r\nvegetable world in the sixteenth century made their appearance in\r\nalliance with the culture prevailing at the time, and how gradually\r\nby the intellectual efforts of gifted men, who at first did not even\r\nbear the name of botanists, an ever deepening insight was obtained into\r\nthe relationship of all plants one to another, into their outer form\r\nand inner organisation, and into the vital phenomena or physiological\r\nprocesses dependent on these conditions.\r\n\r\nFor the attainment of this end it was above all things necessary for\r\nme to form a clear judgment respecting the influence of the views\r\nand principles enunciated by the different authors on the further\r\ndevelopment of botanical science. This is to the historian of science\r\nthe central point round which all beside should be disposed, and\r\nwithout which the entire work breaks up into a collection of unmeaning\r\ndetails, and it is one which demands knowledge of the subject, and\r\ncapacity and impartiality of judgment. On questions connected with\r\ntimes long gone by the decision of the experts has in most cases been\r\nalready given, though I myself found to my surprise that older authors\r\nhad for centuries been regarded as the founders of views which they\r\nhad distinctly repudiated as absurd, showing how necessary it is that\r\nthe works of our predecessors should from time to time be carefully\r\nread and compared together. But in the majority of cases there is no\r\ndispute at the present day respecting the historical value, that is the\r\noperative influence on posterity, of works written three hundred or\r\neven one hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nBut it is a very different matter when the author of a book like mine\r\nventures, as I have done for sufficient reasons but at the same time\r\nwith regret, to sit in judgment on the works of men of research and\r\nexperts, who belong to our own time and who exert a lively influence\r\non their generation. In this case the author can no longer appeal to\r\nthe consentient opinion of his contemporaries; he finds them divided\r\ninto parties, and involuntarily belongs to a party himself. But it is\r\na still more weighty consideration that he may subsequently change his\r\nown point of view, and may arrive at a more profound insight into the\r\nvalue of the works which he has criticised; continued study and maturer\r\nyears may teach him that he overestimated some things fifteen or twenty\r\nyears ago and perhaps undervalued others, and facts, once assumed to be\r\nwell established, may now be acknowledged to be incorrect.\r\n\r\nThus it has happened in my own case also in some but not in many\r\ninstances, in which I have had to express an opinion respecting the\r\ncharacter of works which appeared after 1860, and which to some extent\r\ninfluenced my judgment on the years immediately preceding them. But\r\nthis was from fifteen to eighteen years ago when I was working at my\r\nHistory. It might perhaps be expected that I should remove all such\r\nexpressions of opinion from the work before it is translated. In some\r\nfew cases, in which this could be effected by simply drawing the\r\npen through a few lines, I have so done; but it appeared to me that\r\nto alter with anxious care every sentence which I should put into a\r\ndifferent form at the present day would serve no good purpose, for\r\nI came to the conclusion that my book itself may be regarded as a\r\nhistorical fact, and that the kindly and indulgent reader may even be\r\nglad to know what one, who has lived wholly in the science and taken\r\nan interest in everything in it old and new, thought from fifteen to\r\neighteen years ago of the then reigning theories, representing as he\r\ndid the view of the majority of his fellow-botanists.\r\n\r\nHowever, these remarks relate only to two famous writers on the\r\nsubjects with which this History is concerned. If the work had been\r\nbrought to a close with the year 1850 instead of 1860, I should hardly\r\nhave found it necessary to give them so prominent a position in it.\r\nTheir names are Charles Darwin and Karl Nägeli. I would desire that\r\nwhoever reads what I have written on Charles Darwin in the present\r\nwork should consider that it contains a large infusion of youthful\r\nenthusiasm still remaining from the year 1859, when the ‘Origin of\r\nSpecies’ delivered us from the unlucky dogma of constancy. Darwin’s\r\nlater writings have not inspired me with the like feeling. So it\r\nhas been with regard to Nägeli. He, like Hugo von Mohl, was one\r\nof the first among German botanists who introduced into the study\r\nthat strict method of thought which had long prevailed in physics,\r\nchemistry, and astronomy; but the researches of the last ten or\r\ntwelve years have unfortunately shown that Nägeli’s method has been\r\napplied to facts which, as facts, were inaccurately observed. Darwin\r\ncollected innumerable facts from the literature in support of an idea,\r\nNägeli applied his strict logic to observations which were in part\r\nuntrustworthy. The services which each of these men rendered to the\r\nscience are still acknowledged; but my estimate of their importance\r\nfor its advance would differ materially at the present moment from\r\nthat contained in my History of Botany. At the same time I rejoice in\r\nbeing able to say that I may sometimes have overrated the merits of\r\ndistinguished men, but have never knowingly underestimated them.\r\n\r\n                                      DR.

Their chief object was to discover the\r\nplants employed by the physicians of antiquity, the knowledge of which\r\nhad been lost in later times. The corrupt texts of Theophrastus,\r\nDioscorides, Pliny and Galen had been in many respects improved and\r\nillustrated by the critical labours of the Italian commentators of\r\nthe 15th and of the early part of the 16th century; but there was one\r\nimperfection which no criticism could remove,—the highly unsatisfactory\r\ndescriptions of the old authors or the entire absence of descriptions.\r\nIt was moreover at first assumed that the plants described by the Greek\r\nphysicians must grow wild in Germany also, and generally in the rest\r\nof Europe; each author identified a different native plant with some\r\none mentioned by Dioscorides or Theophrastus or others, and thus there\r\narose as early as the 16th century a confusion of nomenclature which it\r\nwas scarcely possible to clear away. As compared with the efforts of\r\nthe philological commentators, who knew little of plants from their own\r\nobservation, a great advance was made by the first German composers of\r\nherbals, who went straight to nature, described the wild plants growing\r\naround them and had figures of them carefully executed in wood. Thus\r\nwas made the first beginning of a really scientific examination of\r\nplants, though the aims pursued were not yet truly scientific, for no\r\nquestions were proposed as to the nature of plants, their organisation\r\nor mutual relations; the only point of interest was the knowledge of\r\nindividual forms and of their medicinal virtues.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions were at first extremely inartistic and unmethodical;\r\nbut the effort to make them as exact and clear as was possible led\r\nfrom time to time to perceptions of truth, that came unsought and lay\r\nfar removed from the object originally in view. It was remarked that\r\nmany of the plants which Dioscorides had described in his Materia\r\nMedica do not grow wild in Germany, France, Spain, and England, and\r\nthat conversely very many plants grow in these countries, which\r\nwere evidently unknown to the ancient writers; it became apparent\r\nat the same time that many plants have points of resemblance to one\r\nanother, which have nothing to do with their medicinal powers or\r\nwith their importance to agriculture and the arts. In the effort to\r\npromote the knowledge of plants for practical purposes by careful\r\ndescription of individual forms, the impression forced itself on\r\nthe mind of the observer, that there are various natural groups of\r\nplants which have a distinct resemblance to one another in form and\r\nin other characteristics. It was seen that there were other natural\r\nalliances in the vegetable world, beside the three great divisions\r\nof trees, shrubs, and herbs adopted by Aristotle and Theophrastus.\r\nThe first perception of natural groups is to be found in Bock, and\r\nlater herbals show that the natural connection between such plants\r\nas occur together in the groups of Fungi, Mosses, Ferns, Coniferae,\r\nUmbelliferae, Compositae, Labiatae, Papilionaceae was distinctly felt,\r\nthough it was by no means clearly understood how this connection was\r\nactually expressed; the fact of natural affinity presented itself\r\nunsought as an incidental and indefinite impression, to which no great\r\nvalue was at first attached. The recognition of these groups required\r\nno antecedent philosophic reflection or conscious attempt to classify\r\nthe objects in the vegetable world; they present themselves to the\r\nunprejudiced eye as naturally as do the groups of mammals, birds,\r\nreptiles, fishes and worms in the animal kingdom. The real resemblance\r\nof the organisms in such groups is unconsciously accepted by the mind\r\nthrough the association of ideas, and it is not till this involuntary\r\nmental act, which in itself requires no effort of the understanding, is\r\naccomplished, that any necessity is felt for obtaining a clearer idea\r\nof the phenomenon, and the sense of this necessity is the first step to\r\nintentional systematic enquiry. The series of botanical works published\r\nin Germany and the Netherlands from 1530 to 1623, from Brunfels to\r\nKaspar Bauhin, shows very plainly how this perception of a grouping by\r\naffinity in the vegetable kingdom grew more and more distinct; but it\r\nalso shows how these men merely followed an instinctive feeling in the\r\nmatter, and made no enquiry into the cause of the relationship which\r\nthey perceived.\r\n\r\nNevertheless a great step in advance was thus taken; all the\r\nforeign matter introduced into the description of plants by medical\r\nsuperstition and practical considerations was seen to be of secondary\r\nimportance, and was indeed altogether thrown aside by Kaspar Bauhin;\r\nthe fact of natural affinity, the vivifying principle of all botanical\r\nresearch, came to the front in its place, and awakened the desire to\r\ndistinguish more exactly whatever was different, and to bring together\r\nmore carefully all that was like in kind. Thus the idea of natural\r\naffinity in plants is not a discovery of any single botanist, but is a\r\nproduct, and to some extent an incidental product, of the practice of\r\ndescribing plants.\r\n\r\nBut before the exhibition of the natural affinity gave birth to the\r\nfirst efforts at classification on the part of de l’Obel (Lobelius)\r\nand afterwards of Kaspar Bauhin, the Italian botanist Cesalpino (1583)\r\nhad already attempted a system of the vegetable kingdom on a very\r\ndifferent plan. He was led to distribute all vegetable forms into\r\ndefinite groups not by the fact of natural affinity, which impressed\r\nitself on the minds of the botanists of Germany and the Netherlands\r\nthrough involuntary association of ideas, but by philosophical\r\nreflection. Trained in the philosophy which flourished in Italy in\r\nthe 16th century, deeply imbued with the doctrines of Aristotle, and\r\npractised in all subtleties of the schools, Cesalpino was not the\r\nman to surrender himself quietly to the influence of nature on the\r\nunconscious powers of the mind; on the contrary, he sought from the\r\nfirst to bring all that he learnt from the writings of others and from\r\nhis own acute observation of the forms of plants into subjection to\r\nhis own understanding. Hence he approached the task of the scientific\r\nbotanist in an entirely different way from that of de l’Obel and Kaspar\r\nBauhin. It was by philosophical reflections on the nature of the plant\r\nand on the substantial and accidental value of its parts, according to\r\nAristotelian conceptions, that he was led to distribute the vegetable\r\nkingdom into groups and sub-groups founded on definite marks.\r\n\r\nThis difference in the origin of the systematic efforts of Cesalpino on\r\nthe one hand and of de l’Obel and Bauhin on the other is unmistakably\r\napparent; the Germans were instinctively led by the resemblances to\r\nthe conception of natural groups, Cesalpino on the contrary framed his\r\ngroups on the sharp distinctions which resulted from the application\r\nof predetermined marks; all the faults in Bauhin’s system are due to\r\nincorrect judgment of resemblances, those of Cesalpino to incorrectness\r\nin distinguishing.\r\n\r\nBut the main point of difference lies in the fact, that the system\r\nis presented by de l’Obel and Bauhin without any statement of the\r\nprinciples on which it rests; in their account of it the association\r\nof ideas is left to perfect itself in the mind of the reader, as it\r\ngrew up before in the authors themselves. De l’Obel and Bauhin are\r\nlike artists, who convey their own impressions to others not by words\r\nand descriptions, but by pictorial representations; Cesalpino, on\r\nthe other hand, addresses himself at once to the understanding of\r\nhis reader and shows him on philosophic grounds that there must be a\r\nclassification, and states the principles of this classification; it\r\nwas on philosophic grounds also that he made the characters of the seed\r\nand the fruit the basis of his arrangement, while the German botanists,\r\npaying little attention to the organs of fructification, were chiefly\r\ninfluenced by the general impression produced by the plant, by its\r\nhabit as the phrase now is.\r\n\r\nThe historians of botany have overlooked the real state of the case\r\nas here presented, or have not described it with sufficient emphasis;\r\ndue attention has not been paid to the fact, that systematic botany,\r\nas it began to develope in the 17th century, contained within itself\r\nfrom the first two opposing elements; on the one hand the fact of\r\na natural affinity indistinctly felt, which was brought out by the\r\nbotanists of Germany and the Netherlands, and on the other the desire,\r\nto which Cesalpino first gave expression, of arriving by the path of\r\nclear perception at a classification of the vegetable kingdom which\r\nshould satisfy the understanding. These two elements of systematic\r\ninvestigation were entirely incommensurable; it was not possible by\r\nthe use of arbitrary principles of classification which satisfied\r\nthe understanding to do justice at the same time to the instinctive\r\nfeeling for natural affinity which would not be argued away. This\r\nincommensurability between natural affinity and _a priori_ grounds of\r\nclassification is everywhere expressed in the systems embracing the\r\nwhole vegetable kingdom, which were proposed up to 1736, and which\r\nincluding those of Cesalpino and Linnaeus were not less in number than\r\nfifteen. It is the custom to describe these systems, of which those\r\nof Cesalpino, Morison, Ray, Bachmann (Rivinus), and Tournefort are\r\nthe most important, by the one word ‘artificial’[1]; but it was by no\r\nmeans the intention of those men to propose classifications of the\r\nvegetable kingdom which should be merely artificial, and do no more\r\nthan offer an arrangement adapted for ready reference. It is true that\r\nthe botanists of the 17th century and Linnaeus himself often spoke of\r\nfacility of use as a great object to be kept in view in constructing\r\na system; but every one who brought out a new system did so really\r\nbecause he believed that his own was a better expression of natural\r\naffinities than those of his predecessors. If some like Ray and Morison\r\nwere more influenced by the wish to exhibit natural affinities by\r\nmeans of a system, and others as Tournefort and Magnol thought more\r\nof framing a perspicuous and handy arrangement of plants, yet it is\r\nplain from the objections which every succeeding systematist makes to\r\nhis predecessors, that the exhibition of natural affinities was more\r\nor less clearly in the minds of all as the main object of the system;\r\nonly they all employed the same wrong means for securing this end, for\r\nthey fancied that natural affinities could be brought out by the use of\r\na few easily recognised marks, whose value for systematic purposes had\r\nbeen arbitrarily determined. This opposition between means and end runs\r\nthrough all systematic botany from Cesalpino in 1583 to Linnaeus in\r\n1736.\r\n\r\nBut a new departure dates from Linnaeus himself, since he was the first\r\nwho clearly perceived the existence of this discord. He was the first\r\nwho said distinctly, that there is a natural system of plants, which\r\ncould not be established by the use of predetermined marks, as had\r\nbeen previously attempted, and that even the rules for framing it were\r\nstill undiscovered. In his Fragments of the date of 1738, he gave a\r\nlist of sixty-five groups or orders, which he regarded provisionally\r\nas cycles of natural affinity, but he did not venture to give their\r\ncharacteristic marks. These groups, though better separated and more\r\nnaturally arranged than those of Kaspar Bauhin, were like his founded\r\nsolely on a refined feeling for the relative resemblances and graduated\r\ndifferences that were observed in comparing plants with one another,\r\nand this is no less true of the enumeration of natural families\r\nattempted by Bernard de Jussieu in 1759. To such of these small\r\ngroups of related forms as had not been already named both Linnaeus\r\nand Jussieu gave names, which they took not from certain marks, but\r\nfrom the name of a genus in each group. But this mode of naming plainly\r\nexpresses the idea which from that time forward prevailed in systematic\r\nbotany, that there is a common type lying at the foundation of each\r\nnatural group, from which all its forms though specifically distinct\r\ncan be derived, as the forms of a crystal may all be derived from\r\none fundamental form,—an idea which was also expressed by Pyrame de\r\nCandolle in 1819.\r\n\r\nBut botanists could not rest content with merely naming natural\r\ngroups; it was necessary to translate the indistinct feeling, which\r\nhad suggested the groups of Linnaeus and Bernard de Jussieu, into the\r\nlanguage of science by assigning clearly recognised marks; and this was\r\nfrom this time forward the task of systematists from Antoine Laurent\r\nde Jussieu and de Candolle to Endlicher and Lindley. But it cannot\r\nbe denied, that later systematists repeatedly committed the fault of\r\nsplitting up natural groups of affinity by artificial divisions and of\r\nbringing together the unlike, as Cesalpino and the botanists of the\r\n17th century had done before them, though continued practice was always\r\nleading to a more perfect exhibition of natural affinities.\r\n\r\nBut while natural relationship was thus becoming more and more the\r\nguiding idea in the minds of systematists, and the experience of\r\ncenturies was enforcing the lesson, that predetermined grounds of\r\nclassification could not do justice to natural affinities, the fact of\r\naffinity became itself more unintelligible and mysterious. It seemed\r\nimpossible to give a clear and precise definition of the conception,\r\nthe exhibition of which was felt to be the proper object of all efforts\r\nto discover the natural system, and which continued to be known by\r\nthe name of affinity. A sense of this mystery is expressed in the\r\nsentence of Linnaeus: ‘It is not the character (the marks used to\r\ncharacterise the genus) which makes the genus, but the genus which\r\nmakes the character;’ but the very man, who first distinctly recognised\r\nthis difficulty in the natural system, helped to increase it by his\r\ndoctrine of the constancy of species. This doctrine appears in Linnaeus\r\nin an unobtrusive form, rather as resulting from daily experience and\r\nliable to be modified by further investigation; but it became with\r\nhis successors an article of faith, a dogma, which no botanist could\r\neven doubt without losing his scientific reputation; and thus during\r\nmore than a hundred years the belief, that every organic form owes its\r\nexistence to a separate act of creation and is therefore absolutely\r\ndistinct from all other forms, subsisted side by side with the fact\r\nof experience, that there is an intimate tie of relationship between\r\nthese forms, which can only be imperfectly indicated by definite marks.\r\nEvery systematist knew that this relationship was something more than\r\nmere resemblance perceivable by the senses, while thinking men saw\r\nthe contradiction between the assumption of an absolute difference\r\nof origin in species (for that is what is meant by their constancy)\r\nand the fact of their affinity. Linnaeus in his later years made some\r\nstrange attempts to explain away this contradiction; his successors\r\nadopted a way of their own; various scholastic notions from the 16th\r\ncentury still survived among the systematists, especially after\r\nLinnaeus had assumed the lead among them, and it was thought that the\r\ndogma of the constancy of species might find especially in Plato’s\r\nmisinterpreted doctrine of ideas a philosophical justification, which\r\nwas the more acceptable because it harmonised well with the tenets\r\nof the Church. If, as Elias Fries said in 1835, there is ‘quoddam\r\nsupranaturale’ in the natural system, namely the affinity of organisms,\r\nso much the better for the system; in the opinion of the same writer\r\neach division of the system expresses an idea (‘singula sphaera\r\n(sectio) ideam quandam exponit’), and all these ideas might easily\r\nbe explained in their ideal connection as representing the plan of\r\ncreation. If observation and theoretical considerations occasionally\r\nsuggested objections to such views, these objections were usually\r\nlittle regarded, and in fact reflections of this kind on the real\r\nmeaning of the natural system did not often make their appearance;\r\nthe most intelligent men turned away with an uncomfortable feeling\r\nfrom these doubts and difficulties, and preferred to devote their\r\ntime and powers to the discovery of affinities in individual forms.\r\nAt the same time it was well understood that the question was one\r\nwhich lay at the foundation of the science. At a later period the\r\nresearches of Nägeli and others in morphology resulted in discoveries\r\nof the greatest importance to systematic botany, and disclosed facts\r\nwhich were necessarily fatal to the hypothesis, that every group\r\nin the system represents an idea in the Platonic sense; such for\r\ninstance were the remarkable embryological relations, which Hofmeister\r\ndiscovered in 1851, between Angiosperms, Gymnosperms, Vascular\r\nCryptogams and Muscineae; nor was it easy to reconcile the fact, that\r\nthe physiologico-biological peculiarities on the one hand and the\r\nmorphological and systematic characters on the other are commonly quite\r\nindependent of one another, with the plan of creation as conceived by\r\nthe systematists. Thus an opposition between true scientific research\r\nand the theoretical views of the systematists became more and more\r\napparent, and no one who paid attention to both could avoid a painful\r\nfeeling of uncertainty with respect to this portion of the science.\r\nThis feeling was due to the dogma of the constancy of species, and to\r\nthe consequent impossibility of giving a scientific definition of the\r\nidea of affinity.\r\n\r\nThis state of things finally ceased with the appearance of Darwin’s\r\nfirst and best book on the origin of species in 1859; from a multitude\r\nof facts, some new, but most of them long well-known, he showed that\r\nthe constancy of species was no longer an open question; that the\r\ndoctrine was no result of exact observation, but an article of faith\r\nopposed to observation. The establishment of this truth was followed\r\nalmost as a matter of course by the true conception of that which had\r\nbeen hitherto figuratively called affinity; the degrees of affinity\r\nexpressed in the natural system indicated the different degrees of\r\nderivation of the varying progeny of common parents; out of affinity\r\ntaken in a figurative sense arose a real blood-relationship, and the\r\nnatural system became a table of the pedigree of the vegetable kingdom.\r\nHere was the solution of the ancient problem.\r\n\r\nDarwin’s theory has this special interest in the history of the\r\nscience, that it established clearness in the place of obscurity, a\r\nscientific principle in place of a scholastic mode of thought, in the\r\ndomain of systematic botany and morphology. Yet Darwin did not effect\r\nthis change in opposition to the historical development of our science\r\nor independently of it; on the contrary his great merit is that he has\r\ncorrectly appreciated the problems long existing in systematic botany\r\nand morphology from the point of view of modern research, and has\r\nsolved them.\r\n\r\nThat the constancy of species is incompatible with the idea of\r\naffinity, that the morphological (genetic) nature of organs does not\r\nproceed on parallel lines with their physiological and functional\r\nsignificance, are facts which were known in botany and zoology before\r\nthe time of Darwin; but he was the first to show, that variation and\r\nnatural selection in the struggle for existence solve these problems,\r\nand enable us to conceive of these facts as the necessary effects\r\nof known causes; it is at the same time explained, why the natural\r\naffinity first recognised by de l’Obel and Kaspar Bauhin cannot be\r\nexhibited by the use of predetermined principles of classification, as\r\nwas attempted by Cesalpino.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE BOTANISTS OF GERMANY AND THE NETHERLANDS FROM BRUNFELS TO KASPAR\r\nBAUHIN[2].\r\n\r\n1530-1623.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen those who are accustomed to modern botanical literature take up\r\nfor the first time the works of Otto Brunfels (1530), Leonhard Fuchs\r\n(1542), Hieronymus Bock (Tragus), or of the later authors Rembert\r\nDodoens (Dodonäus), Charles de l’Écluse (Carolus Clusius), Matthias\r\nde l’Obel (Lobelius, 1576), or even those of Kaspar Bauhin from the\r\nbeginning of the 17th century, they are surprised not only by the\r\nstrange form, the curious and unfamiliar accessories from which what\r\nis really useful must be laboriously extracted, but still more by the\r\nextraordinary poverty of thought which characterises these composers of\r\nusually very thick folios. If however instead of travelling backwards\r\nfrom the present time they pursue the opposite direction; if they have\r\npreviously occupied themselves with the botanical views of Aristotle\r\nand the comprehensive botanical works of his disciple Theophrastus\r\nof Eresus, with Pliny’s Natural History and the medical science\r\nof Dioscorides; if they have made themselves acquainted with the\r\nbotanical literature of the middle ages and noted how it continually\r\ngrows less and less valuable, and have proceeded through the works\r\nof Albertus Magnus, as prolix as they are deficient in ideas, to the\r\n‘Hortus Sanitatis’ (Garden of Health), the popular work on natural\r\nhistory before and after 1500, and similar productions, then certainly\r\nthey receive a very different and almost imposing impression even from\r\nthe first herbals, those of Brunfels, Bock, and Fuchs. These books\r\nwill appear to them almost modern in comparison with the last-named\r\nproductions of medieval superstition, nor will they fail to perceive\r\nthat a new epoch of natural science commenced with these men, and above\r\nall that they laid the foundations of modern botany. They give us, it\r\nis true, nothing but separate descriptions of the wild and cultivated\r\nplants of Germany, and these for the most part of common occurrence,\r\narranged by Fuchs alphabetically, by Bock grouped under the heads of\r\nherbs, shrubs, and trees, and following one another under each head\r\nin the most motley order; it is true that these descriptions are so\r\nnaive and inartistic as hardly to offer points of comparison with\r\nmodern scientifically correct diagnoses; but the great point is, that\r\nthey are taken from the plants as they lay before the writers, who had\r\noften seen and carefully examined them. Woodcuts are added to supply\r\nany defects in the description, and to give a clear idea of the plant\r\nintended by the name; and these figures, which always give the whole\r\nplant and were drawn immediately from nature by the hands of practised\r\nartists, are so true to nature that a botanist’s eye at once recognises\r\nin every case the object meant to be represented. These figures and\r\ndescriptions (the latter are wanting in Brunfels[3], 1530) would have\r\nrendered a great service to the science, even if they had not been\r\nas good as they are; for botanical literature had sunk so low, that\r\nnot only were the figures embellished with fabulous additions, as in\r\nthe ‘Hortus Sanitatis,’ and sometimes drawn purely from fancy, but the\r\nmeagre descriptions of quite common plants were not taken from nature,\r\nbut borrowed from earlier authorities and eked out with superstitious\r\nfictions. The powers of independent judgment were oppressed and stunted\r\nin the middle ages, till at last the very activity of the senses,\r\nresting as it does to a great extent on unconscious operations of\r\nthe understanding, became weak and sickly; natural objects presented\r\nthemselves to the eye even of those who made them their study in\r\ngrotesquely distorted forms; every sensuous impression was corrupted\r\nand deformed by the influence of a superstitious fancy. In comparison\r\nwith these perversions the artless descriptions of Bock appear suitable\r\nand true, and are refreshing from their immediate contact with nature;\r\nwhile in the more learned Fuchs criticism of other writers is already\r\nseen united with actual examination of natural objects. Great was the\r\ngain when men began once more to look at plants with open eyes, to\r\ntake pleasure in their variety and beauty. It was not necessary for a\r\nwhile that they should speculate on the nature of plants, or the cause\r\nof plant-life; time enough for that when sufficient practice had been\r\ngained in the perception of their resemblances and differences.\r\n\r\nThe German fathers of botany connected their labours with the\r\nbotanical literature of classical antiquity only so far as they\r\nsought to recognise in the plants of their own country those named by\r\nTheophrastus, Dioscorides, Pliny and Galen. The attempt to do this\r\nindeed led to many mistakes, for the descriptions of the ancient\r\nbotanists were very imperfect and often quite unserviceable for the\r\nrecognition of the plants described. In this point therefore the\r\ncompilers of herbals found no models worthy of imitation in the old\r\nwriters. But in seeking to recover a knowledge of the medicinal plants\r\nof the Greek physicians[4], they were compelled to compare together a\r\ngreat variety of native plants, and thus to exercise and perfect the\r\nfaculty of apprehending differences of form. This mode of proceeding,\r\narising out of medical requirements, directed the attention entirely\r\nto the individual form, which was also the chief thing required in the\r\ninterest of pure science, and much more was thus gained than if these\r\nmen had only followed the philosophical writings of Aristotle[5] and\r\nTheophrastus[6]. The Greek authors built their views on the philosophy\r\nof botany on very weak foundations; scarcely a plant was known to them\r\nexactly in all its parts; they derived much of their knowledge from\r\nthe accounts of others, often from dealers in herbs. From this scanty\r\nmaterial and from various popular superstitions had Aristotle formed\r\nhis views on the nature of plants, and if Theophrastus possessed more\r\nexperimental knowledge, he still saw facts in the light of his master’s\r\nphilosophical doctrines. If we succeed in the present day in extracting\r\nmuch that is accurate from the writings of Aristotle and Theophrastus,\r\nit was nevertheless well that the first compilers of herbals ceased\r\nto pay attention to them, and occupied themselves with accumulating\r\ndescriptions of individual plants worked out by themselves with all\r\npossible exactness. History shows that in this way a new science\r\narose in the course of a few years, while the philosophical botany of\r\nAristotle and Theophrastus has led to no important result. Moreover\r\nwe shall see how even in the hands of a philosophically gifted and\r\nscholarly man like Cesalpino the teaching of Aristotle had only a\r\nmischievous effect on the study of plants.\r\n\r\nIf the compilers of herbals did not aim at deducing general conclusions\r\nfrom their observations, yet the continually accumulating descriptions\r\nof individual forms gradually gave rise of themselves to perceptions\r\nof an abstract and more comprehensive character. The feeling for\r\nresemblance and difference of form especially was developed, and\r\nfinally the idea of natural relationship; and though this idea was\r\nas yet by no means worked out with scientific precision, it was\r\nnevertheless, even in the indistinct form in which it appears in de\r\nl’Obel in 1576 and more clearly in Kaspar Bauhin in 1623, a result\r\nof the highest value, and one of which neither learned antiquity\r\nnor the middle ages had ever caught a glimpse. The perception of\r\na natural affinity among plants could only be obtained from exact\r\ndescription a thousand times repeated, never from the abstractions\r\nof the Aristotelian school, which rested essentially on superficial\r\nobservation. It appears then that the scientific value of the herbals\r\nof the 16th century lay mostly in the description of such plants as\r\nevery botanist found in a somewhat limited portion of his native land,\r\nand considered worth his notice; at the same time the later compilers\r\nendeavoured to give a universal character to each herbal by admitting\r\nplants which had not been actually seen by the writer; each as far as\r\npossible gathered from his predecessors all that they had seen, and\r\nadded what he had himself seen that was new; but in contrast with the\r\nprevious centuries the peculiar merit of each new herbal was held to\r\ndepend not on what the compiler had borrowed from his predecessors,\r\nbut on what he had added from his own observation. Hence every one was\r\nanxious to introduce into his work as many plants unknown till that\r\ntime or unnoticed as he possibly could, and the number of descriptions\r\nof individual forms mounted rapidly up; in Fuchs in 1542 we find\r\nabout five hundred species described and figured, but in 1623 the\r\nnumber of species as enumerated by Kaspar Bauhin had risen to six\r\nthousand. As the botanists were spread over a large part of Germany,\r\nFuchs in Bavaria and afterwards at Tübingen, Bock on the middle Rhine,\r\nKonrad Gesner at Zürich, Dodoens and de l’Obel in the Netherlands, a\r\nterritory of considerable extent was thus examined; it was enlarged\r\nby the contributions which travellers brought or transmitted to the\r\nbotanists, and de l’Écluse especially traversed a large part of Germany\r\nand Hungary and even of Spain, and eagerly collected and described\r\nthe plants of those countries. During this period also the number of\r\nknown plants was increased from Italy, partly by the exertions of\r\nItalian botanists, such as Mattioli, and partly by travelling Germans.\r\nThe first flora of the Thüringer-Wald was written by Thal, but not\r\npublished till after his death in 1588. Botanical gardens even, though\r\nin more modest form than in our day, were already helping in the 16th\r\ncentury to add to the knowledge of plants; the first were formed in\r\nItaly, as at Padua in 1545, at Pisa in 1547, at Bologna in 1567 under\r\nAldrovandi, afterwards under Cesalpino. Soon similar collections of\r\nliving plants were made in the north; in 1577 a botanic garden was\r\nfounded at Leyden, over which de l’Éluse long presided, in 1593 at\r\nHeidelberg and at Montpellier; in the course of the next century the\r\nnumber of these gardens was considerably increased.\r\n\r\nThe preserving of dried plants, the formation of the collections\r\nwhich we now call herbaria, dates from the 16th century; at that time\r\nhowever the word herbarium meant a book of plants. In this matter also\r\nthe Italians led the way. According to Ernst Meyer, Luca Ghini seems\r\nto have been the first who made use of dried plants for scientific\r\npurposes, and his two pupils Aldrovandi and Cesalpino are said to have\r\nformed the first herbaria in our sense of the word; one of the first\r\ncollections of the kind, perhaps of the date of 1559, was the herbarium\r\nformed by Ratzenberger, which was discovered in the museum at Cassel a\r\nfew years since and described by Kessler.\r\n\r\nThese are matters somewhat external to our immediate subject, but\r\nthey show how lively an interest was taken in botany in the latter\r\nhalf of the sixteenth century; this is still more shown by the great\r\nnumber of books of plants, published with numerous and expensive\r\nplates and in some cases going through several editions. But the\r\nartistic and scientific value of the drawings, which were appended\r\nto the descriptions and in later herbals were reckoned by thousands,\r\ndid not keep equal pace with their number; Fuchs’ splendid figures\r\nremained unapproached, and gradually, as the distance from Dürer’s time\r\nincreased, the wood-cuts grew smaller and poorer[7], and sometimes even\r\nquite indistinct. The art of describing on the contrary continually\r\nimproved; the descriptions became fuller, and gradually a certain\r\nmethod appeared in assigning marks and in estimating their value;\r\ncritical remarks on the identity or non-identity of species, the\r\nseparation of forms previously considered to be alike, and similar\r\nmatters occur more frequently. The descriptions in de l’Éluse may in\r\nfact claim to be called scientific; in Kaspar Bauhin they appear in the\r\nform of terse and methodical diagnoses.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable thing to us in these descriptions from Fuchs and\r\nBock to Bauhin is the striking neglect of the flowers and fruit. The\r\nearliest descriptions, especially those of Bock, endeavour to depict\r\nthe form of the plant in words, to render directly the impression on\r\nthe senses; special attention was paid to the shape of the leaves, the\r\nnature of the ramification, the character of the roots, the size and\r\ncolour of the flowers. KONRAD GESNER[8] was the only one who bestowed\r\na closer attention on the flowers and parts of the fruits; he figured\r\nthem repeatedly, and recognised their great value for the determination\r\nof affinity, as we learn from his expressions in his letters; but the\r\nmuch occupied and much harassed man died before he could complete the\r\nwork on plants which he had long been preparing, and when in the 18th\r\ncentury Schmidel published Gesner’s figures, which meanwhile had passed\r\nthrough various hands, the work too long delayed remained useless to a\r\nscience which had already outstripped it.\r\n\r\nIt will be gathered from the above remarks, that we find in these\r\nauthors no approach to a system of morphology founded on a comparative\r\nexamination of the parts of plants, and therefore no regular technical\r\nlanguage. Still the more learned among them felt the necessity of\r\nconnecting the words they used in describing a plant with a fixed\r\nsense, of defining their conceptions; and though their first efforts\r\nin this direction were weak, they deserve notice, because they show\r\nmore than anything else how great has been the advance in the study of\r\nnature from the 16th century to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to establish a botanical terminology is to be found\r\nas early as 1542 in the ‘Historia Stirpium’ of LEONHARD FUCHS[9]. Four\r\npages at the beginning of the work are thus occupied. A considerable\r\nnumber of words are explained in alphabetical order—the mode of\r\narrangement which he followed also in describing his plants. It is\r\ndifficult to give a clear idea of this the first botanic terminology\r\nby selected examples; yet the attempt must be made, because it is in\r\nthis way only that we learn to see from what feeble beginnings the\r\nlater scientific terminology and morphology has been developed. Thus\r\nwe read: ‘Acinus’ denotes not merely, as many believe, the grains\r\ninside the grape, but the whole fruit, which consists of juice, of a\r\nfleshy portion with the stones (‘vinaceis’), and of the outer skin.\r\nGalen is quoted as authority for the following explanation: ‘Alae’\r\nare said to be the hollows (angles) between the stem and its branches\r\n(the leaves), from which new sprouts (‘proles’) proceed. ‘Asparragi,’\r\nthe germs of herbs which appear before the leaves and the first\r\nedible shoots are developed. ‘Baccae’ are smaller ‘foetus’ of herbs,\r\nshrubs, and trees, which appear separate and isolated on the plant, as\r\nfor example laurel-berries (‘partus lauri’), and differ from acini,\r\ninasmuch as these are more crowded together. ‘Internodium’ is that\r\nwhich lies between the articulations or knees. ‘Racemus’ is used for\r\nthe bunch of grapes, but does not belong to the vine only, but also to\r\nthe ivy and other herbs and shrubs which bear clusters of any kind. The\r\nmajority of such explanations of names concern the forms of the stem\r\nand the branches, but the most remarkable thing about the whole list\r\nis, that it does not include the words flower and root; yet under the\r\nword ‘julus’ occurs the statement, that it is that which in the hazel\r\n‘compactili callo racematim cohaeret,’ and may be described as a long\r\nworm borne on a special pendent stalk and coming before the fruit.\r\nThough the word flower is not explained, yet some parts of the flower\r\nare mentioned; thus it is said, ‘stamina sunt, qui in medio calycis\r\nerumpunt apices, sic dicta quod veluti filamenta intimo floris sinu\r\nprosiliant.’ The explanation of the word fruit may be added: ‘Fructus,\r\nquod carne et semine compactum est; frequenter tamen pro co, quod\r\ninvolucro perinde quasi carne et semine coactum est, accipi solet.’\r\n\r\nProgress in this direction was slow but still recognisable. In the\r\nlast edition of the ‘Pemptades’ of DODOENS[10] of the year 1616, a\r\nfolio volume of 872 pages, only one page and a third are devoted to\r\nthe explanation of the parts of plants; but the selection of the words\r\nexplained and the substance of the explanations hit the essential\r\npoints better than in Fuchs. We find for instance: Root (‘radix, ῥίζα’)\r\nis the name given in the tree and in every other plant to the lower\r\npart, by which it penetrates into the earth and cleaves to it, and by\r\nwhich it draws its nourishment. This part, unlike the leaves which\r\nare usually deciduous, is common to all plants, a few only excepted\r\nwhich live and grow without roots, such as Cassytha, Viscum, and\r\nthe plant called ‘Hyphear,’ Fungi, Mosses, and Fuci, all which are\r\nhowever usually reckoned among φῦτα. ‘Caudex’ is in trees and shrubs\r\nthat which springs from the root and rises above the ground, and by\r\nwhich the nourishment is carried upwards; the same part is called in\r\nherbs caulis or cauliculus. Leaf (‘folium’) is in every plant that\r\nwhich clothes and adorns it, and without which trees and other plants\r\nappear naked. The definition of a flower would lose in a translation:\r\n‘flos, ἄνθος, arborem et herbarum gaudium dicitur, futurique fructus\r\nspes est; unaquaeque etenim stirps pro natura sua post florem partus\r\nac fructus gignit.’ The parts of the flower are with him the calyx\r\n(‘calyx’), in which the blossom is at first enclosed and with which\r\nthe ‘foetus’ is soon surrounded, stamens (‘stamina’) which arise like\r\nthreads from the depth of the blossom and from the calyx, and ‘apices’\r\n(anthers), certain thickish appendages on the summit of the stamens.\r\n‘Julus’ (catkin) is that which hangs down round and long in place of\r\nthe flower, as in the walnut, hazel, mulberry, beech, and other trees.\r\n‘Fructus’ is that in which the seed is formed, but frequently it is\r\nitself the seed, as where the latter is not enclosed in anything else\r\nand is formed naked. We must not be led by these words to think of our\r\nGymnosperms, but must understand that here, as with all botanists till\r\nthe time of A. L. de Jussieu and Joseph Gärtner (1788), naked seeds\r\nmean dry indehiscent fruits.\r\n\r\nDe l’Obel, from whom especially we might have looked for similar\r\nexplanations, has given none.\r\n\r\nThe absence of more profound comparative examination of the parts of\r\nplants, as shown in the examples of terminology here adduced, may\r\nserve as an additional support of the assertion, that natural affinity\r\nwas not inferred from exact comparison of the form of organs, but was\r\nthe result of a feeling arising from the likeness of habit directly\r\napprehended by the senses, that is by the collective impression\r\nproduced by the whole plant.\r\n\r\nPassing to the consideration of the attempts in systematic botany made\r\nby the Germans in this period, the chief thing to notice is, that\r\nthe division into the main groups of trees, shrubs, undershrubs, and\r\nherbs was the one generally adopted; these groups were borrowed from\r\nantiquity and were maintained even by the special systematists, from\r\nCesalpino to the beginning of the 18th century; nor was any change made\r\nin principle when these four groups were reduced to three or two (trees\r\nand herbs). It was moreover considered to be self-evident that trees\r\nwere the most perfect plants. Hence when relationship is spoken of in\r\nsubsequent remarks, it must be understood that this holds good only\r\nwithin the groups just mentioned. The classifications of the German\r\nand Dutch botanists not only sprang from the describing of individual\r\nplants, but they were originally in a certain sense identical with\r\nit. In undertaking to describe individual forms, the first task\r\nwas to separate those which closely resembled one another, for the\r\nresemblance of systematically-allied plants is often so great, that\r\nto distinguish them specifically requires consideration and careful\r\ncomparison. The resemblance is more obvious than the difference. There\r\nare moreover many plants which are entirely distinct from one another\r\nin their inner nature, but which appear strikingly alike if we regard\r\nthe impression produced immediately on the senses, and the converse\r\nof this statement is equally true. Hence the attempt to circumscribe\r\nand fix individual forms in the act of describing was at once found\r\nto involve difficulties, the solution of which leads directly to the\r\nconception of some kind of arrangement. A comparison of the herbals\r\nof Fuchs and Bock up to Kaspar Bauhin shows very plainly how these\r\ndifficulties were gradually overcome, how the describing of single\r\nspecies led necessarily, and without the intention of the describer,\r\nto considerations of a distinctly systematic character. Where the\r\nspecies in a group of forms, which we now designate as a genus or\r\nfamily, closely resemble each other in habit, there arose of itself the\r\ninstinctive feeling that such forms belong to one another. This feeling\r\nasserted itself in words when, as was done from the first, a number of\r\nsuch forms were without conscious reflection designated by the same\r\nname; thus, to mention one of many examples, we find Bock applying\r\nthe name Wolfsmilk, Euphorbia, not to one species of the genus, but\r\nto several, which he then distinguishes by epithets (common, least,\r\ncypress, sweet). The customary mode of expression in the herbals is\r\nvery instructive on this point; there are, they say, two or more of\r\nthis or that plant which have not been hitherto distinguished. But this\r\nfeeling of connection and similarity of kind was produced not only by\r\nforms that were closely allied, but also by such as belong to extensive\r\ngroups of the system; thus the words moss, lichen, fungus, alga, fern,\r\nhad long served to include a great number of distinct forms, though the\r\nseparation of these groups had nowhere in truth been carried out with\r\nlogical precision.\r\n\r\nThese remarks are important as serving to show in the most decisive\r\nmanner the incorrectness of the assertion, that the study of organisms\r\nsprang from the recognition of individual species; that it is this\r\nwhich is directly given, and that without it no advance in the science\r\nis possible. The historical fact rather is, that descriptive botany\r\nbegan often, perhaps most often, not with species but with genera\r\nand families, that very often at first whole groups of forms were\r\nconceived of as unities, which had to be divided later and of set\r\npurpose into separate forms; and up to the present day one part of\r\nthe task of the systematist is to undertake the splitting up of forms\r\npreviously regarded as identical. The notion that the species is the\r\nobject originally presented to the observer, and that certain species\r\nwere afterwards united into genera, is one that was invented in\r\npost-Linnaean times under the dominion of the dogma of the constancy of\r\nspecies; it happened so sometimes, but just as often the genus was the\r\nobject first presented, and the task of the describer was to resolve it\r\ninto a number of species. In the 16th century the conception neither\r\nof genus or species had yet been defined; for the botanists of that\r\nperiod genera and species had the same objective reality. But, in the\r\nprocess of continually making the descriptions of individual plants\r\nmore exact, forms once separated were united, and those before assumed\r\nto be identical were separated, till it gradually became apparent that\r\nboth operations must be pursued with system and method. It cannot\r\ntherefore be exactly said that somebody first established the species,\r\nanother the genus, and a third person again the larger groups. It is\r\nmore correct to say that the botanists of the 16th century carried out\r\nthis process of separation up to a certain point without intending it,\r\nand in the effort to give the greatest possible preciseness to their\r\ndescriptions of individual forms. It lay therefore in the nature of\r\nthe case, that those groups which we call genera and species should\r\nfirst be cleared up, and we find in fact at the end of this period in\r\nKaspar Bauhin the genera already distinguished by names, if not by\r\ncharacters; the species by names and characters. Together with these\r\nsmaller groups, many more comprehensive ones, which we now designate\r\nfamilies, were also marked off and supplied with names, which are still\r\nin use. The 16th century established the groups and names of Coniferae,\r\nUmbelliferae, Verticillatae (Labiatae), Capillares (Ferns), and others.\r\nIt is true that the determination of the limits of these groups by\r\ndistinct marks was not yet attempted, but the plants belonging to these\r\ngroups were again and again treated of in special chapters or ranged\r\nin due succession one after another. But as long as this was done to\r\nsome extent without design, and the real meaning of this relationship\r\nwas not yet recognised, other considerations of very various kinds\r\ninfluenced the composition of the books and disturbed the natural\r\narrangement. The feeling for natural affinity supplants all other\r\nconsiderations in de l’Obel first, and after him much more completely\r\nin Kaspar Bauhin.\r\n\r\nEnough perhaps has now been said to render the main result of the\r\nbotanical efforts of the period, which we are considering, intelligible\r\nto the reader; but a clear view of the method of describing plants\r\nat that time, and of the way in which systematic botany came into\r\nbeing, can only be shown by examples; and if we proceed to give some\r\nhere, it is with the purpose with which figures copied as exactly as\r\npossible from nature are added to treatises on natural history, because\r\na real understanding is only to be gained in this way. The botanical\r\nliterature of the 16th century is so different from that of the 19th,\r\nthat a very indistinct idea of it could be obtained from a statement of\r\nresults expressed in modern terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuchs, Historia Stirpium, 1542.\r\n\r\nThe common plant now known as Convolvulus arvensis is there called\r\nHelxine cissampelos, and is described in the following manner:\r\n\r\n‘_Nomina._—Ἑλξινὴ κισσάμπελος Graecis, Helxine cissampelus et\r\nConvolvulus Latinis nominatur. Vulgus herbariorum et officinae\r\nVolubilem mediam et vitealem appellant, Germani Mittelwinden oder\r\nWeingartenwinden. Recte autem Cissampelos dicitur, in vineis enim\r\npotissimum nascitur et folio hederaceo. Convolvulus vero quod crebra\r\nrevolutione vicinos frutices et herbas implicet.\r\n\r\n_Forma._—Folia habet hederae similia, minora tamen, ramulos exiguos\r\ncircumplectentes quodcumque contigerint. Folia denique ejus scansili\r\nordine alterna subeunt. Flores primum candidos lilii effigie, dein in\r\npuniceum vergentes, profert. Semen angulosum in folliculis acinorum\r\nspecie.\r\n\r\n_Locus._—In vineis nascitur, unde etiam ei appellatio cissampeli, ut\r\ndiximus, indita est.\r\n\r\n_Tempus._—Aestate, potissimum autem Julio et Augusto mensibus, floret.‘\r\n\r\nHIERONYMUS BOCK[11], at page 299 of his ‘Herbal,’ published at\r\nStrassburg in 1560, describes the same plant and Convolvulus sepium as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n‘Of the white wind-bell.\r\n\r\n‘Two common wind-plants grow everywhere in our land with white\r\nbell-flowers. The larger prefers to dwell by hedges, and creeps over\r\nitself, twists and twines, etc. The little wind- or bell-flower\r\n(Convolvulus arvensis) is like the large one with its roots, round\r\nstems, leaves and bell-flowers, in all things smaller, thinner,\r\nand shorter. Some flowers on this plant are quite white, some of a\r\nbeautiful flesh colour, painted with reddish brown streaks. It grows in\r\ndry meadows, in herb-and onion-gardens, and does harm therein, because\r\nwith its creeping and twining it oppresses other garden herbs, and is\r\nalso bad to exstirpate, because the thin white rootlets make their way\r\ndeep downwards, spread very widely, and are continually putting forth\r\nnew and young clusters like hops.’\r\n\r\nThen follows a long paragraph on the names, that is, a critical\r\nreview of the opinions of different writers on the question, which\r\nof Dioscorides’ or Pliny’s names should be applied to the plant\r\ndescribed. ‘I must think,’ says Bock, ‘that this flower is a wild sort,\r\nScammonia Dioscoridis (but harmless), which herb Dioscorides also calls\r\ncolophonia, dactylion, apopleumenon, sanilum, and colophonium,’ and\r\nso on. Then follows a chapter on its virtue and effect externally and\r\ninternally.\r\n\r\nAs regards the arrangement of the 567 species described by Bock, he\r\ndivides his book into three parts, the first and second containing the\r\nsmaller herbs, the third the shrubs and trees. In each part closely\r\nallied plants are generally described in larger or smaller numbers one\r\nimmediately after another, though the compiler is all the time under\r\nthe influence of very various considerations, and follows no general\r\nprinciple. For instance, our Convolvulus stands in the midst of a\r\nnumber of other very different plants, which either climb as the ivy,\r\nor twine with tendrils as Smilax; then follows Lysimachia Nummularia,\r\nwhich simply runs along the ground, then the hop, Solanum Dulcamara,\r\nClematis, Bryonia, Lonicera, and different Cucurbitaceae; immediately\r\nafter come the Burdocks, Teasels, and Thistles, and these are followed\r\nby some Umbelliferae. The whole work is conceived in a similar spirit;\r\nthe feeling for relationship is clearly to be traced within very\r\nnarrow circles, but it finds imperfect expression and is frequently\r\ndisturbed by reference to biological habit; this appears especially\r\nin the beginning of the third part, which treats of shrubs generally,\r\nshrubs which form hedges, and trees, ‘as they grow in our German land’;\r\nthe first chapter is on the fungi which grow on trees, the second on\r\nsome mosses, and these are followed immediately by the mistletoe. Then\r\ncome the heather and some smaller shrubs, and finally larger and\r\nthe largest trees. The chapter on Fungi under the section ‘Of names’\r\ncontains a statement of views on the nature of fungi, such as are often\r\nrepeated even into the 17th century: ‘Mushrooms are neither herbs nor\r\nroots, neither flowers nor seeds, but merely the superfluous moisture\r\nof the earth and trees, of rotten wood and other rotten things. From\r\nsuch moisture grow all tubera and fungi. This is plain from the fact\r\nthat all the above-mentioned mushrooms, those especially which are used\r\nfor eating, grow most when it will thunder or rain, as Aquinas Ponta\r\nsays. For this reason the ancients paid peculiar regard to them, and\r\nwere of opinion that tubera, since they come up from no seed, have some\r\nconnection with the sky; Porphyrius speaks also in this manner, and\r\nsays that fungi and tubera are called children of the gods, because\r\nthey are born without seeds and not as other kinds.’\r\n\r\nWe pass over Valerius Cordus, Conrad Gesner, Mattioli[12], and some\r\nother unimportant writers, and turn to Dodoens, de l’Écluse, and\r\nDalechamps, in whom a marked tendency to orderly arrangement appears,\r\nthough the principle of arrangement in all three lies essentially in\r\npoints external and accidental, and above all in the relations of the\r\nplant-world to mankind. Within the divisions thus artificially formed a\r\nconstantly increasing attention is paid to natural affinities, but at\r\nthe same time allied forms are separated without scruple in deference\r\nto the artificial principle of classification. It can also be plainly\r\nseen, that these writers think more of giving some order to their\r\nmatter than of discovering the arrangement that will be in conformity\r\nwith nature. It is impossible to give the reader a good idea of these\r\nclassifications in our scientific language; it would be necessary to\r\ntranscribe them. For brevity’s sake we will here quote DE L’ÉCLUSE\r\nonly[13], the best of the three writers named above. In his ‘Rariorum\r\nplantarum historia,’ which appeared as early as 1576, but which lies\r\nbefore the writer of these pages in the edition of 1601, the first book\r\ntreats of trees, shrubs, and undershrubs; the second of bulbous plants;\r\nthe third of sweet-smelling flowers; the fourth of those without\r\nsmell; the fifth of poisonous, narcotic, and acrid plants; the sixth\r\nof those that have a milky juice, and of Umbelliferae, Ferns, Grasses,\r\nLeguminosae, and some Cryptogams.\r\n\r\nA similar arrangement is found in Dalechamps[14]; that of Dodoens in\r\nhis ‘Pemptades’ is more perplexed and unnatural; but the design in\r\nboth of them is evidently much the same as that of de l’Écluse. This\r\ndesign is best seen from the introductory observations to each book;\r\nde l’Écluse, for instance, says at page 127, ‘Having treated of the\r\nhistory of trees, shrubs, and undershrubs, and put these together in\r\nthe preceding book, we will now in this second book describe such\r\nplants as have a bulbous or tuberous root, many of which attract and\r\ndelight the eyes of all persons in an extraordinary degree by the\r\nelegance and variety of their flowers, and which therefore ought not\r\nto have the lowest place assigned to them among garland-plants (‘inter\r\ncoronarias’). We will begin with the plants of the lily kind, on\r\naccount of their size and the beauty of their flowers, etc. etc.‘ The\r\nintroductions to the several books of the ‘Pemptades’ of Dodoens are\r\nmore learned and more diffuse. It is plain that the composers of these\r\nworks had no thought of arranging their matter on the principles of a\r\ntrue natural system, but were only anxious to give some kind of order\r\nto their descriptions of individual plants. Hence their divisions do\r\nnot appear under the names of classes and subdivisions (‘genera majora\r\net minora,’ as they would have been called at that time), but they\r\nare sections of the whole work kept as symmetrical as was possible.\r\nIf we would discover in these works whatever may really lay claim\r\nto systematic value, we must not rely on the sections as they are\r\ntypographically distinguished, but must observe within each of them\r\nthe order in which the plants are given, and then it becomes apparent\r\nthat within the frame once established forms naturally allied are, as\r\nfar as may be, grouped together. For instance, we find in the second\r\nbook of de l’Écluse’s work first of all a long list of true Liliaceae\r\nand Asphodeleae, Melanthaceae, and Irideae described in unbroken\r\nsuccession; then comes Calamus, and then without any explanation a\r\nnumber of the Ranunculaceae, among which the genera Ranunculus and\r\nAnemone are very well distinguished; but then follows the genus\r\nCyclamen with several species, and next a number of Orchideae, in the\r\nmiddle of which appear Orobanche and Corydalis, followed by Helleborus\r\nniger, Veratrum album, Polygonatum, and others. So it is in the other\r\nsections, though in general the species of a genus stand together,\r\nand even the genera of a family are not unfrequently united; but with\r\nall this there are no proper breaks, because other considerations\r\nare perpetually disturbing the feeling for natural relationship. The\r\ndescriptions of de l’Écluse are generally commended, and they deserve\r\nto be commended for their fulness of detail and their attention to\r\nthe structure of the flowers, though he, like de l’Obel and Dodoens,\r\ndescribes the leaves more minutely than any other part of the plant.\r\n\r\nWith DE L’OBELL[15], as has been already observed, the feeling for\r\nnatural affinity declares itself for the first time so decidedly as to\r\noutweigh if not entirely to set aside all other considerations. The\r\nfact is disclosed to us in the preface to his ‘Stirpium adversaria\r\nnova’ of 1576, where these words occur: ‘proinde adversariorum voce\r\nnovas veteribus additas plantas et novum ordinem quadantenus innuimus.\r\nQui ordo utique sibi similis et unus progreditur ducitque a sensui\r\npropinquioribus et magis familiaribus ad ignotiora et compositiora,\r\nmodumque sive progressum similitudinis sequitur et familiaritatis, quo\r\net universim et particulatim, quantum licuit per rerum varietatem et\r\nvastitatem, sibi responderet. Sic enim ordine, quo nihil pulchrius in\r\ncoelo aut in sapientis animo, quae longe lateque disparata sunt unum\r\nquasi fiunt, magno verborum memoriae et cognitionis compendio, ut\r\nAristoteli et Theophrasto placet.’\r\n\r\nWe must not indeed expect to find that de l’Obel really produced a\r\nnatural system of plants; but his ‘Observationes’ still more than his\r\n‘Adversaria’ attest his efforts to arrange plants according to their\r\nresemblances in form; and in these efforts he is guided not by instinct\r\nmerely and the general habit, but mainly and with evident purpose by\r\nthe form of the leaves; thus beginning with Grasses, which have narrow,\r\nlong, and simple leaves, he proceeds to the broader-leaved Liliaceae\r\nand Orchideae; then passing on to the Dicotyledons he exhibits the\r\nmain groups in fairly well limited masses. Still the Ferns appear in\r\nthe middle of the Dicotyledons on account of the form of their leaves,\r\nwhile on the other hand, the Cruciferae, Umbelliferae, Papilionaceae\r\nand Labiatae remain but little disturbed in their continuity by\r\nsecondary considerations.\r\n\r\nThe progress of botanical science in the period which we have been\r\nconsidering reaches its highest point in the labours of Kaspar\r\nBauhin[16], as regards both the naming and describing of individual\r\nplants and their classification according to likeness of habit. In\r\nBauhin all secondary considerations have disappeared; his works may be\r\ncalled botanical in the strict scientific meaning of the word, and they\r\nshow how far it is possible to advance in a descriptive science without\r\nthe aid of a general system of comparative morphology, and how far the\r\nmere perception of likeness of habit is a sufficient foundation for\r\na natural classification of plants; it was scarcely possible to make\r\ngreater advances on the path pursued by the botanists of Germany and\r\nthe Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of species in the ‘Prodromus Theatri Botanici’ of\r\nKASPAR BAUHIN (1620) notice all obvious parts of the plant with all\r\npossible brevity and in a fixed order; the form of the root, height and\r\nform of the stem, characters of the leaves, flowers, fruit, and seed\r\nare given in concise sentences seldom occupying more than twenty short\r\nlines; the description of a single species is here in fact developed\r\ninto an art and becomes a diagnosis.\r\n\r\nA still higher value must be set on the fact, that in Kaspar Bauhin the\r\ndistinction between species and genus is fully and consciously carried\r\nout; every plant has with him a generic and a specific name, and this\r\nbinary nomenclature, which Linnaeus is usually thought to have founded,\r\nis almost perfectly maintained by Bauhin, especially in the ‘Pinax’; it\r\nis true that a third and fourth word is not unfrequently appended to\r\nthe second, the specific name, but this additional word is evidently\r\nonly an auxiliary. It is remarkable on the other hand, that he has\r\nadded no characters to the names of the genera; it is only from the\r\nname that we know that several species belong to one genus; we might\r\nalmost believe that the characters of the genus are intended to be\r\nsupplied by the strange etymological explanation appended in italics\r\nto the generic name. These fanciful etymologies maintained themselves\r\nto the end of the 17th century, when Tournefort did battle with them;\r\nthey were an evil which sprang in a great measure from Aristotelian and\r\nscholastic modes of thought, and from the belief that it was possible\r\nto conceive of the nature of a thing from the original meaning of its\r\nname.\r\n\r\nNothing shows better the earnestness of Bauhin’s research than the\r\nfact, that he devoted the labour of forty years to his ‘Pinax,’ in\r\norder to show how each one of the species given by him was named by\r\nearlier botanists. The example already given from Fuchs shows how many\r\nnames a plant had received by the middle of the 16th century; even in\r\nDioscorides and Pliny we find a whole row of names given for a single\r\nplant, and the botanists of Fuchs’ time used their utmost endeavours\r\nto attach the names in Dioscorides and other ancient writers to\r\nparticular plants found in central Europe. Dioscorides, Theophrastus,\r\nand Pliny either add no descriptions to the names of their plants, or\r\nthey describe them in so unsatisfactory a manner, that it was a very\r\ndifficult task for the science of that day, as it is still for us,\r\nto recognise the plants of the ancient writers; hence arose such a\r\nconfusion of names that the reader of a botanical work can never be\r\nsure whether the plant of one author is the same as that of another\r\nwith the same name. A description of a plant is therefore usually\r\naccompanied in the 16th century by a critical enquiry how far the name\r\nused agrees with that of other authors. Kaspar Bauhin sought to put an\r\nend to this condition of uncertainty by his ‘Pinax,’ in which he showed\r\nin the case of all species known to him what were the names given to\r\nthem by the earlier writers, and he has thus enabled us to see our\r\nway through the nomenclature of the period of which we are speaking;\r\nthe ‘Pinax’ is in a word the first and for that time a completely\r\nexhaustive book of synonyms, and is still indispensable for the history\r\nof individual species—no small praise to be given to a work that is\r\nmore than 250 years old.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been unsuitable to the purpose of the author of the\r\n‘Pinax,’ if he had allowed himself to give the plants in alphabetical\r\norder, but instead of this we find a careful arrangement according\r\nto natural affinities. This directly proves what is also confirmed\r\nby the ‘Prodromus,’ that Bauhin regarded such an arrangement as of\r\nthe greatest importance. In this point, as in others, he goes far\r\nbeyond his predecessors; he pursues the same method as de l’Obel had\r\npursued forty years before, but he carries it out more thoroughly. At\r\nthe same time he shares with his predecessors the peculiarity of not\r\ndistinguishing the larger groups, which with some exceptions answer to\r\nour present families, by special names or by descriptions; it is only\r\nfrom the order in which the species follow one another that we can\r\ngather his views on natural relationship. It follows therefore that\r\nthe natural families, so far as they are distinguishable in Bauhin’s\r\nworks, have no sharp bounding lines; we might almost conclude that he\r\npurposely avoided assigning such limits, that he might be able to pass\r\nwithout interruption from one chain of relationship to another.\r\n\r\nLike de l’Obel, Bauhin proceeds in his enumeration from the supposed\r\nmost imperfect to the more perfect forms, beginning with the Grasses\r\nand the majority of Liliaceae and Zingiberaceae, passing on to\r\ndicotyledonous herbs, and ending with shrubs and trees.\r\n\r\nThe Cryptogams that were known to him stand in the middle of the series\r\nof dicotyledonous herbs, between the Papilionaceae and the Thistles,\r\nthe Equisetaceae being reckoned among the Grasses. On the great\r\ndistinction between Cryptogams and Phanerogams the views of Bauhin\r\nwere evidently less clear than those of many of his predecessors; but\r\nit will not seem strange that he should place some Phanerogams, as\r\nfor instance the Duckweeds, among the Cryptogams and the Salviniaceae\r\namong the Mosses, and unite the Corals, Alcionieae, and Sponges with\r\nthe Seaweeds, when we consider that it was not till the middle of the\r\n18th century that more correct views arose in respect to these forms,\r\nand that Linnaeus himself could not decide whether the Zoophytes\r\nshould be excluded from the vegetable kingdom and ranked with animals.\r\nThe knowledge of plants in the scientific sense of the word was till\r\nthe beginning of the 19th century limited to the Phanerogams; and\r\nin speaking of principles and methods in descriptive botany before\r\nthat time we must think only of the Phanerogams, or at most of the\r\nPhanerogams and the Ferns. The methodical examination of the Cryptogams\r\nbelongs to quite recent botanical research. The matter is here alluded\r\nto only in connection with the fact, that it is from the works of\r\nKaspar Bauhin, a writer of ability, in whom the first period of\r\nscientific botany culminates, that we most clearly see how great the\r\nadvance has been since his time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL SYSTEMS AND TERMINOLOGY OF ORGANS FROM CESALPINO TO LINNAEUS.\r\n\r\n1583-1760.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile botany was being developed in Germany and the Netherlands in the\r\nmanner described in the previous chapter, and long before this process\r\nof development reached its furthest point in Kaspar Bauhin, ANDREA\r\nCESALPINO in Italy was laying down the general plan, on which the\r\nfurther advance of descriptive botany was to proceed in the 17th and\r\ntill far into the 18th century; all that was done in the 17th century\r\nin Germany, England, and France towards furthering morphology and\r\nsystematic botany was done with a reference to Cesalpino’s principles,\r\nwhether these were accepted and made use of, or whether it was sought\r\nto refute them. This connection with Cesalpino became gradually less\r\nclose and less obvious, being concealed by new points of view and by\r\nthe increase of material for observation; but Cesalpino’s ideas on the\r\ntheoretical principles of systematic botany and the nature of plants\r\nappear so plainly, even in the views of Linnaeus, that no one can\r\nread both authors without lighting not unfrequently upon passages in\r\nLinnaeus’ ‘Fundamenta’ or in his ‘Philosophia Botanica,’ which remind\r\nhim of Cesalpino, and even upon sentences borrowed from him. As we\r\nsaw in Kaspar Bauhin the close of the course of development commenced\r\nby Fuchs and Bock, so we may regard Linnaeus as having built up and\r\ncompleted the edifice of doctrine founded by Cesalpino.\r\n\r\nCesalpino comes before us, in strong contrast with the simple-minded\r\nempiricism of the German fathers of botany, as the thinker in presence\r\nof the vegetable world. Their main task was the amassing descriptions\r\nof individual plants. Cesalpino made the material gathered by\r\nexperience the subject of earnest reflection; he sought especially to\r\nobtain universals from particulars, important principles from sensuous\r\nperceptions; but as his forms of thought were entirely Aristotelian, it\r\nwas inevitable that his interpretation of the facts should introduce\r\ninto them much that would have to be got rid of subsequently by the\r\ninductive method. Cesalpino differs also from the German botanists in\r\nanother respect; he did not rest satisfied with the general impression\r\nproduced by the plants, but carefully examined the separate parts and\r\npaid attention to the small and concealed organs; he was the first\r\nwho converted observation into real scientific research; and thus\r\nwe find in him a remarkable union of inductive natural science and\r\nAristotelian philosophy, a mixture which gives a peculiar character to\r\nthe theoretical efforts of his successors down to Linnaeus.\r\n\r\nCesalpino was moreover much before his time in his mode of\r\ncontemplating the vegetable kingdom, seeking always for philosophical\r\ncombinations and comprehensive points of view. His work which appeared\r\nin 1583 exercised no perceptible influence on his contemporaries; a\r\ntrace of such influence only may be seen in Kaspar Bauhin thirty or\r\nforty years later, while the work of the botanists who followed Bauhin\r\ndown to 1670 was confined everywhere to increasing the knowledge of\r\nindividual plants. With this object travels were undertaken after 1600\r\nto all parts of the world; many new botanic gardens were added to the\r\nfew which had been founded in the 16th century—as at Giessen in 1617,\r\nat Paris in 1620, at Jena in 1629, at Oxford in 1632, at Amsterdam in\r\n1646, at Utrecht in 1650. Instead of endeavouring to embrace with their\r\nlabours the whole vegetable kingdom, botanists preferred to devote\r\nthemselves to the examination of single districts. This gave rise to\r\nthe first local floras (the word flora, however, was first introduced\r\nby Linnaeus in the next century), and of these Germany especially\r\nsoon produced a considerable number; a flora of Altorf was published\r\nby Ludwig Jungermann in 1615, of Ingolstadt by Albert Menzel in 1618,\r\nof Giessen by Jungermann in 1623, of Dantzic by Nicolaus Oelhafen in\r\n1643, of Halle by Carl Scheffer in 1662, of the Palatinate by Frank von\r\nFrankenau in 1680, of Leipsic by Paul Ammann in 1675, of Nuremberg by\r\nJ. Z. Volkamer in 1700.\r\n\r\nBut though travel, catalogues in local floras, and the cultivation of\r\nplants in botanic gardens promote knowledge of very varied kind, yet\r\nthis remains scattered about among descriptions of plants, until at\r\nlast a writer with powers of combination and wider and deeper glance\r\nendeavours to gain some general conclusions from them. Such attempts\r\nwe first meet with late in the second half of the 17th century in\r\nMorison, Ray, Bachmann (Rivinus), Tournefort, and others, who took\r\nup Cesalpino’s principles after they had lain neglected for almost a\r\nhundred years, and indeed were almost forgotten by botanists.\r\n\r\nIn the dearth of higher scientific efforts during this period, the\r\ndescribing of plants and cataloguing of species prolonged a somewhat\r\npitiful existence. This describing, a work of great usefulness in the\r\nfathers of German botany, was now become by perpetual repetition a\r\nmechanical labour; all that was to be gained in this way had already\r\nbeen gained by de l’Obel and Bauhin. This sterility which followed\r\nupon the fruitful beginnings of the 16th century was general; neither\r\nin Germany nor Italy, neither in France nor England, did the botanists\r\nproduce anything of importance. The representatives of the science did\r\nnot count among the more highly gifted or among the thinkers of their\r\ntime; and so content with the minor work of collecting and cataloguing\r\nplants, and with endeavouring to know all plants as far as possible by\r\nname, they lost whatever capacity they may have possessed for more\r\ndifficult operations of the mind simply by not attempting them.\r\n\r\nThere was one man indeed in Germany who studied the vegetable kingdom\r\nin the first half of the 17th century in the spirit of Cesalpino before\r\nhim, but who, like Cesalpino, found no honour among contemporary\r\nbotanists. This man was the well-known philosopher Joachim Jung,\r\nwho invented a comparative terminology for the parts of plants, and\r\noccupied himself with critical enquiries into the theory of the system,\r\nthe naming of species and other subjects, embodying their results in a\r\nlong array of aphorisms. Free from the genius-stifling burden which the\r\nknowledge of individual species had become, a man possessed of varied\r\naccomplishments and a well-trained mind, Jung was better qualified\r\nthan the professed botanists to see what was wanted in botany and\r\nwould advance it—a phenomenon more than once repeated in the history\r\nof the science. But his results remained unknown to all except his\r\nimmediate pupils, till Ray admitted them into his great work on plants\r\nin 1693, and made them the foundation of his own theoretical botany.\r\nEnriched by Ray’s good morphological remarks, Jung’s terminology passed\r\nto Linnaeus, who adopted it as he adopted every thing useful that\r\nliterature offered him, improving it here and there, but impairing its\r\nspirit by his dry systematising manner.\r\n\r\nThe labours of the botanists of Germany and the Netherlands during\r\nthe 17th century, which culminated in Kaspar Bauhin, were not without\r\nimportant influence upon the development of systematic botany which\r\nbegan with Cesalpino. When Cesalpino wrote the work which forms an\r\nepoch in the science, he was perhaps unacquainted with the natural\r\nclassification of de l’Obel (1576); at least there is nothing in his\r\nbook which shows that he had seen it; it appears even as though he had\r\nmade the discovery independently, that there is an actual connection of\r\nrelationship among plants expressed in their organisation as a whole;\r\nit is at any rate certain that this fact assumed from the first an\r\nentirely different expression in his system from that which it received\r\nat the hands of de l’Obel and Bauhin, inasmuch as he was not guided\r\nby an indistinct feeling for resemblances, but believed that he could\r\nestablish on predetermined grounds a system of marks, by which the\r\nobjective relationship must be recognised. If Cesalpino was thus in\r\nadvance of the German botanists, since he endeavoured to express with\r\nclearness and on principle that which they only felt indistinctly,\r\nhe was at the same time treading a dangerous path, and one which led\r\nsucceeding botanists astray till the time of Linnaeus,—the path which\r\nmust always lead to artificial classifications, since the natural\r\nsystem can never be laid down upon _a priori_ principles of division.\r\nThrough this labyrinth, in which botanists down to Linnaeus wandered\r\nfruitlessly hither and thither, there remained one guide consistently\r\npointing to the goal to be attained, namely, the feeling for natural\r\naffinity first vividly apprehended by the German botanists, and\r\nexpressed by them to some extent in their classifications. And when at\r\nlast Linnaeus and Bernard de Jussieu made the first feeble attempts\r\nat a natural arrangement, it was the same indistinct perception which\r\nasserted itself in them as in de l’Obel and Bauhin, and enabled them to\r\nsee that the path hitherto trodden could only lead astray.\r\n\r\nThe period in the development of descriptive botany which begins with\r\nCesalpino and reaches to Linnaeus may accordingly be perhaps best\r\ncharacterised by saying, that botanists sought to do justice to natural\r\naffinities by means of artificial classifications, till at length\r\nLinnaeus clearly perceived the contradiction involved in this method\r\nof proceeding. But inasmuch as Linnaeus left it to the future to work\r\nout the natural system, and arranged the plants which he described in\r\na confessedly artificial manner, he so far marks rather the close of a\r\nprevious condition of the science than the beginning of modern botany.\r\n\r\nThese introductory observations will have supplied the reader with the\r\nthread which will guide him through the following account of the more\r\nprominent points in the history of botanical science from Cesalpino to\r\nLinnaeus.\r\n\r\nThe often-quoted work of Andrea Cesalpino[17], ‘De plantis libri XVI,’\r\nappeared in Florence in the year 1583. If the value of the contemporary\r\nGerman botanists lies pre-eminently in the accumulation of descriptions\r\nof individual plants, and these, it is true, occupy fifteen books of\r\nCesalpino’s work, it is on the contrary the introduction in the first\r\nbook, a discussion of the general theory of the subject, which in\r\nhis case is of much the higher importance for the history of botany.\r\nThis contains in thirty pages a full and connected exposition of the\r\nwhole of theoretical botany, and though based on broad and general\r\nviews is at the same time extremely rich in matter conveyed in a very\r\nconcise form. The different branches into which the subject has since\r\nbeen divided are here united into an inseparable whole; morphology,\r\nanatomy, biology, physiology, systematic botany, terminology are\r\nso closely combined, that it is difficult to explain Cesalpino’s\r\nviews on any one more general question without at the same time\r\ntouching on a variety of other matters. Three things more especially\r\ncharacterise this introductory book; first, a great number of new and\r\ndelicate observations; secondly, the great importance which Cesalpino\r\nassigns to the organs of fructification as objects of morphological\r\ninvestigation; lastly, the way in which he philosophises in strictly\r\nAristotelian fashion on the material thus gained from experience. If\r\nthis treatment has produced a work beautiful in style and fascinating\r\nto the reader, if the whole subject is vivified by it while each\r\nseparate fact gains a more general value, it is on the other hand\r\napparent that the writer is often led astray by the well-known elements\r\nof the Aristotelian philosophy, which are opposed to the interests of\r\nscientific investigation. Mere creations of thought, the abstractions\r\nof the understanding, are treated as really existent substances,\r\nas active forces, under the name of principles; final causes appear\r\nside by side with efficient; the organs and functions of the organism\r\nexist either _alicujus gratiâ_ or merely _ob necessitatem_; the whole\r\naccount is controlled by a teleology, the influence of which is the\r\nmore pernicious because the purposes assumed are supposed to be\r\nacknowledged and self-evident, plants and vegetation being conceived of\r\nas in every respect an imperfect imitation of the animal kingdom. It\r\nwas moreover a necessary consequence of the treatment of his material\r\nadopted by Cesalpino, that his ignorance of the sexuality of plants\r\nand of the use of leaves as organs of nutrition led him to false and\r\nmischievous conclusions; this defect of knowledge would have been of\r\nless importance in a purely morphological consideration of plants, as\r\nwe shall see presently in Jung; but with Cesalpino morphological and\r\nphysiological considerations are so mixed up together, that a mistake\r\nin the one direction necessarily involved mistakes in the other.\r\n\r\nThese remarks on Cesalpino’s method may be illustrated by some examples\r\ntending to show how closely he attaches himself to Aristotle, and\r\nhow certain Aristotelian conceptions, the origin of which has not\r\nbeen sufficiently regarded, passed through him into later botanical\r\nspeculation. We shall recur in the History of Physiology to Cesalpino’s\r\nviews on nutrition, and to his rejection of the doctrine of sexuality\r\nin plants.\r\n\r\n‘As the nature of plants,’ so begins Cesalpino’s book, ‘possesses\r\nonly that kind of soul by which they are nourished, grow, and produce\r\ntheir like, and they are therefore without sensation and motion in\r\nwhich the nature of animals consists, plants have accordingly need of\r\na much smaller apparatus of organs than animals.’ This idea reappears\r\nagain and again in the history of botany, and the anatomists and\r\nphysiologists of the 18th century were never weary of dilating on\r\nthe simplicity of the structure of plants and of the functions of\r\ntheir organs. ‘But since,’ continues Cesalpino, ‘the function of\r\nthe nutritive soul consists in producing something like itself, and\r\nthis like has its origin in the food for maintaining the life of the\r\nindividual, or in the seed for continuing the species, perfect plants\r\nhave at most two parts, which are however of the highest necessity; one\r\npart called the root by which they procure food; the other by which\r\nthey bear the fruit, a kind of foetus for the continuation of the\r\nspecies; and this part is named the stem (‘caulis’) in smaller plants,\r\nthe trunk (‘caudex’) in trees.‘\r\n\r\nThis in the main correct conception of the upright stem as the\r\nseed-bearer of the plant was also long maintained in botany. We should\r\nobserve also that the production of the seed is spoken of as merely\r\nanother kind of nutrition, a notion which afterwards prevented Malpighi\r\nfrom correctly explaining the flower and fruit, and in a modified\r\nform led Kaspar Friedrich Wolff in 1759 to a very wrong conception\r\nof the nature of the sexual function. The next sentence in Cesalpino\r\ntakes us into the heart of the Aristotelian misinterpretation of the\r\nplant, according to which the root answers to the mouth or stomach,\r\nand must therefore be regarded in idea as the upper part although it\r\nis the lower in position, and the plant would have to be compared with\r\nan animal set on its head, and the upper and lower parts determined\r\naccordingly: ‘this part (the root) is the nobler (‘superior’) because\r\nit is prior in origin and sunk in the ground; for many plants live by\r\nthe roots only after the stem with the ripe seeds has disappeared; the\r\nstem is of less importance (‘inferior’) although it rises above the\r\nground; for the excreta, if there are any, are given off by means of\r\nthis part; it is, therefore, with plants as with animals as regards the\r\nexpressions ‘pars superior’ and ‘inferior.’ When indeed we take into\r\nconsideration the mode of nourishment, we must define the upper and\r\nthe lower in another way; since in plants and animals the food mounts\r\nupward (for that which nourishes is light because it is carried upwards\r\nby the heat), it was necessary to place the roots below and to make the\r\nstem go straight upwards, for in animals also the veins are rooted in\r\nthe lower part of the stomach, while their main trunk ascends to the\r\nheart and the head.’ Here, in genuine Aristotelian fashion, the facts\r\nare forced into a previously constructed scheme.\r\n\r\nCesalpino’s discussion of the seat of the soul in plants is of special\r\ninterest in connection with certain views of later botanists. ‘Whether\r\nany one part in plants can be assigned as the seat of the soul, such\r\nas the heart in animals, is a matter for consideration—for since the\r\nsoul is the active principle (‘actus’) of the organic body, it can\r\nneither be ‘tota in toto’ nor ‘tota in singulis partibus,’ but entirely\r\nin some one and chief part, from which life is distributed to the\r\nother dependent parts. If the function of the root is to draw food\r\nfrom the earth, and of the stem to bear the seeds, and the two cannot\r\nexchange functions, so that the root should bear seeds and the shoot\r\npenetrate into the earth, there must either be two souls different in\r\nkind and separate in place, the one residing in the root, the other in\r\nthe shoot, or there must be only one, which supplies both with their\r\npeculiar capabilities. But that there are not two souls of different\r\nkinds and in a different part in each plant may be argued thus; we\r\noften see a root cut off from a plant send forth a shoot, and in like\r\nmanner a branch cut off send a root into the ground, as though there\r\nwere a soul indivisible in its kind present in both parts. But this\r\nwould seem to show that the whole soul is present in both parts, and\r\nthat it is wholly in the whole plant, if there were not this objection\r\nthat, as we find in many cases, the capabilities are distributed\r\nbetween the two parts in such a way that the shoot, though buried in\r\nthe ground, never sends out roots, for example in Pinus and Abies, in\r\nwhich plants also the roots that are cut off perish.’ This, he thinks,\r\nproves that there is only one soul residing in root and stem, but that\r\nit is not present in all the parts; in a further discussion he seeks\r\nto discover the true seat of the soul. He points out an anatomical\r\ndistinction between the shoot and the root; the root consists of the\r\nrind and an inner substance which in some cases is hard and woody,\r\nin others soft and fleshy. In the stem on the other hand there are\r\nthree constituent parts; outside the rind, inside the pith, between\r\nthe two a body which in trees is called the wood. This, on the whole,\r\ncorrect distinction between stem and root is followed by a thoroughly\r\nAristotelian deduction.\r\n\r\n‘Since then in all creatures’ (we must remark, that this is assuming\r\na point which has yet to be proved in the case of the half of living\r\ncreatures) ‘nature conceals the principle of life in the innermost\r\nparts, as the entrails in animals, it is reasonable to conclude that\r\nthe principle of life in plants is not in the rind, but is more deeply\r\nhidden in the inner parts, that is, in the pith, which is found in the\r\nstem and not in the root. That this was the opinion of the ancients\r\nwe may gather from the name, for they called this part in plants the\r\nheart (‘cor’), or brain (‘cerebrum’ or ‘matrix’), because from this\r\npart in some degree the principle of foetification (the formation of\r\nthe seed) is derived.’ Here we see why the seed must, according to\r\nCesalpino, have its origin in the pith; the idea was loyally repeated\r\nafter him by Linnaeus, as we shall see hereafter. The argument, which\r\nis a long one, ends with the sentence: ‘There are then two chief\r\nparts in plants, the root and the ascending part; therefore the most\r\nsuitable spot for the heart of plants seems to be in the central part,\r\nnamely, where the shoot joins on to the root. There appears also at\r\nthis spot a certain substance differing both from the shoot and from\r\nthe root, softer and more fleshy than either, for which reason it is\r\nusually called the cerebrum; it is edible in many plants while they\r\nare young.’ We shall see below how important a part this seat of the\r\nsoul of the plant, brought to light with such difficulty and with\r\nall appliances of scholasticism, is intended to play in Cesalpino’s\r\nsystem, and how by this _a priori_ path he was led to the use of the\r\nposition of the embryo in the seed as his principle of division. It\r\nmay be remarked here that the point of union between the root and the\r\nstem, in which Cesalpino placed the seat of the plant-soul, afterwards\r\nreceived the name of root-neck (collet); and though the Linnaean\r\nbotanists of the 19th century were unaware of what Cesalpino had proved\r\nin the 16th, and did not even believe in a soul of plants, they still\r\nentertained a superstitious respect for this part of the plant, which\r\nis really no part at all; and this, it would seem, explains the fact,\r\nthat an importance scarcely intelligible without reference to history\r\nwas once attributed to it, especially by some French botanists. To\r\nreturn once more to Cesalpino’s ‘cor,’ he is not much troubled by the\r\ncircumstance that plants can be reproduced from severed portions; in\r\ntrue Aristotelian manner he says that although the principle of life\r\nis actually only one, yet potentially it is manifold. Ultimately a\r\n‘cor’ is found in the axil of every leaf, by which the axillary shoot\r\nis united with the pith of the mother-shoot, and finally, in direct\r\ncontradiction to the previous proof that the crown of the root is the\r\nseat of the plant-soul, it is distinctly affirmed in Chapter V that the\r\nsoul of plants is in some sense diffused through all their parts.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical introduction to his excellent and copious remarks on\r\nthe parts of fructification may supply another example of Cesalpino’s\r\nperipatetic method: ‘As the final cause (‘finis’) of plants consists\r\nin that propagation which is effected by the seed, while propagation\r\nfrom a shoot is of a more imperfect nature, in so far as plants do\r\nexist in a divided state, so the beauty of plants is best shown in the\r\nproduction of seed; for in the number of the parts, and the forms and\r\nvarieties of the seed-vessels, the fructification shows a much greater\r\namount of adornment than the unfolding of a shoot; this wonderful\r\nbeauty proves the delight (‘delitias’) of generating nature in the\r\nbringing forth of seeds. Consequently as in animals the seed is an\r\nexcretion of the most highly refined food-substance in the heart, by\r\nthe vital warmth and spirit of which it is made fruitful, so also\r\nin plants it is necessary that the substance of the seeds should be\r\nsecreted from the part in which the principle of the natural heat lies,\r\nand this part is the pith. For this reason, therefore, the pith of the\r\nseed (that is, the substance of the cotyledons and of the endosperm)\r\nsprings from the moister and purer part of the food, while the husk\r\nwhich surrounds the seed for protection springs from the coarser part.\r\nIt was unnecessary to separate a special fertilising substance from the\r\nrest of the matter in plants, as it is separated in animals which are\r\nthus distinguished as male and female.‘\r\n\r\nThis last remark and some lengthy deductions which follow are intended\r\nto prove, after the example of Aristotle, the absence and indeed the\r\nimpossibility of sexuality in plants, and accordingly Cesalpino goes\r\non to compare the parts of the flower, which he knew better than his\r\ncontemporaries, with the envelopes of the ova in the foetus of animals,\r\nwhich he regards as organs of protection. Calyx, corolla, stamens,\r\nand carpels are in his view only protecting envelopes of the young\r\nseed, as the leaves are only a means of protecting the young shoots.\r\nMoreover by the word flower (‘flos’) Cesalpino understands only those\r\nparts of the flower which do not directly belong to the rudiment of\r\nthe fruit, namely, the calyx, the corolla, and the stamens. This must\r\nbe borne in mind if we would understand his theory of fructification,\r\nand especially his doctrine of metamorphosis. We must also note, that\r\nby the expression pericarp he understands exclusively juicy edible\r\nfruit-envelopes, though at the same time pulpy seed-envelopes inside\r\nthe fruit pass with him for pericarps. The parts of his flower are\r\nthe ‘folium,’ which evidently means the corolla, but in certain\r\ncases includes also the calyx; the ‘stamen,’ which is our style; and\r\nthe ‘flocci,’ our stamens. We see that Cesalpino uses the same word\r\n‘folium’ without distinction for calyx, corolla, and ordinary leaves;\r\njust as he, and Malpighi a hundred years later, unhesitatingly regarded\r\nthe cotyledons as metamorphosed leaves. In fact the envelopes of the\r\nflower and the cotyledons approach so nearly to the character of\r\nleaves, that every unprejudiced eye must instinctively perceive the\r\nresemblance; and if doubts arose on this point in post-Linnaean times,\r\nit was only a consequence of the Linnaean terminology, which neglected\r\nall comparative examination.\r\n\r\nMoreover the doctrine of metamorphosis appears in a more consistent\r\nand necessary form in Cesalpino than in the botanists of the 19th\r\ncentury before Darwin; it flows more immediately from his philosophical\r\nviews on the nature of plants, and appears therefore up to a certain\r\npoint thoroughly intelligible. We may also consider as part of this\r\ndoctrine in Cesalpino the view that the substance of the seed (embryo\r\nand endosperm) arises from the pith, because the pith contains the\r\nvital principle[18], and as the pith in the shoot is surrounded for\r\nprotection by the wood and the bark, so the substance of the seed\r\nis surrounded by the woody shell, and by the bark-like pericarp or\r\nby a fruit-envelope answering to a pericarp. According to Cesalpino\r\ntherefore the substance of the seed with its capability of development\r\nsprings from the pith, the woody shell from the wood, the pericarp\r\nfrom the rind of the shoot. The difficulty which arises from this\r\ninterpretation, namely, that in accordance with his theory the parts\r\nof the flower also, the calyx, the corolla, and the stamens ought to\r\nspring from the outer tissues of the shoot, he puts aside with the\r\nremark (p. 19) that these parts of the flower are formed when the\r\npericarp is still in a rudimentary state; that the pericarp is only\r\nfully developed after these parts have fallen off, and that they are so\r\nthin that there is nothing surprising in this view of the matter. We\r\nsee in Cesalpino’s doctrine of metamorphosis without doubt the theory\r\nof the flower afterwards adopted by Linnaeus, though in a somewhat\r\ndifferent form. That Linnaeus himself regarded the theory ascribed to\r\nhim on the nature of the flower as the opinion of Cesalpino also,\r\nis shown in his ‘Classes Plantarum,’ where in describing Cesalpino’s\r\nsystem he says: ‘He regarded the flower as the interior portions of\r\nthe plant, which emerge from the bursting rind; the calyx as a thicker\r\nportion of the rind of the shoot; the corolla as an inner and thinner\r\nrind; the stamens as the interior fibres of the wood, and the pistil\r\nas the pith of the plant.’ It may be observed however that this was\r\nnot exactly what Cesalpino says; but it is nevertheless certain that\r\nLinnaeus’ own view as given in these words was intended to reproduce\r\nthat of Cesalpino; and if it does not do this exactly, there is no\r\nessential difference in principle between the two, Linnaeus’ conception\r\nbeing perhaps a more logical statement of Cesalpino’s meaning.\r\nCesalpino’s doctrine of metamorphosis appears plainly on another\r\noccasion also; he says, that we do not find envelopes, stamens, and\r\nstyles in all flowers; the flowers change in some cases into another\r\nsubstance, as in the hazel, the edible chestnut, and all plants that\r\nbear catkins; the catkin is in place of a flower, and is a longish\r\nbody arising from the seat of the fruit, and in this way fruits appear\r\nwithout flowers, for the styles (‘stamina’) form the longer axis of\r\nthe catkin (‘in amenti longitudinem transeunt’), while the leafy parts\r\nand the stamens are changed into its scales. All this shows that the\r\nnotion of a metamorphosis, of which we find intimations as early\r\nas Theophrastus, was a familiar one to Cesalpino, and it fitted in\r\nperfectly with his Aristotelian philosophy, while Goethe’s doctrine on\r\nthe same subject is equally scholastic in its character, and therefore\r\nlooks strange and foreign in modern science. It has already been\r\nobserved that Cesalpino includes only the envelopes and stamens under\r\nthe word flower, and distinguishes the rudiments of the fruit from\r\nthem; therefore he says that there are plants which produce something\r\nin the shape of a catkin, without any hope of fruit, for they are\r\nentirely unfruitful; but those which bear fruit have no flowers, as\r\nOxycedrus, Taxus, and among herbs Mercurialis, Urtica, Cannabis, in\r\nwhich the sterile plants are termed male, the fruitful female. Thus he\r\ndistinguished the cases which we now call dioecious from the previously\r\nmentioned monoecious plants, among which he reckons the maize.\r\n\r\nAll this may serve to give the reader some idea, though a very\r\nincomplete one, of Cesalpino’s theory; to do him justice, it would be\r\nnecessary to give a full account of his very numerous, accurate, and\r\noften acute observations on the position of leaves, the formation of\r\nfruit, the distribution of seeds and their position in the fruit, of\r\nhis comparative observations on the parts of the fruit in different\r\nplants, and above all of his very excellent description of plants with\r\ntendrils and climbing plants, of those that are armed with thorns\r\nand the like. Though there is naturally much that is erroneous and\r\ninexact in his accounts, yet we have before us in the chapters on\r\nthese subjects the first beginning of a comparative morphology, which\r\nquite casts into the shade all that Aristotle and Theophrastus have\r\nsaid on the subject. But the most brilliant portions of his general\r\nbotany are contained in the 12th, 13th, and 14th chapters, in which\r\nhe gives the outlines of his views on the systematic arrangement of\r\nplants; to prepare the way for what is to follow, he shows first\r\nthat it is better to give up the four old divisions of the vegetable\r\nkingdom, and to unite the shrubs with the trees and the undershrubs\r\nwith the herbs. But how these genera are to be distinguished into\r\nspecies is, he says, hard to conceive, for the multitude of plants is\r\nalmost innumerable; there must be many intermediate genera containing\r\nthe ‘ultimae species,’ but few are as yet known. He then turns to the\r\ndivisions founded on the relations of plants to men. Such groups, he\r\nsays, as vegetables and kinds of grain, which are put together under\r\nthe name of ‘fruges’ and kitchen-herbs (‘olera’), are formed more\r\nfrom the use made of them than from the resemblance of form, which we\r\nrequire; and he shows this by good examples. The discerning of plants,\r\nhe continues, is very difficult, for so long as the genera (larger\r\ngroups) are undetermined, the species must necessarily be mixed up\r\ntogether[19]; the difficulty arises from our uncertainty as to the\r\nrules by which we should determine the resemblances of the genera.\r\nWhile there are two chief parts in plants, the root and the shoot, we\r\ncannot, as it seems, determine the genera and species from the likeness\r\nor unlikeness either of the one or of the other; for if we make a genus\r\nof those plants which have a round root, as the turnip, Aristolochia,\r\nCyclamen, Arum, we separate generically things which agree together in\r\na high degree, as rape and radish which agree with the turnip, and the\r\nlong Aristolochia which agrees with the round, while at the same time\r\nwe unite things most dissimilar, for the Cyclamen and the turnip are\r\nin every other respect of a quite different nature; the same is the\r\ncase with divisions which rest merely on differences in the leaves and\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing these reflections, which have the conception of species\r\nchiefly in view, he arrives at the following proposition: That\r\naccording to the law of nature like always produces like, and that\r\nwhich is of the same species with itself.\r\n\r\nAll that Cesalpino says on systematic arrangement shows that he was\r\nperfectly clear in his own mind with regard to the distinction between\r\na division on subjective grounds, and one that respects the inner\r\nnature of plants themselves, and that he accepted the latter as the\r\nonly true one. He says, for instance, in the next chapter: ‘We seek\r\nout similarities and dissimilarities of form, in which the essence\r\n(‘substantia’) of plants consists, but not of things which are merely\r\naccidents of them (‘quae accidunt ipsis’).’ Medicinal virtues and other\r\nuseful qualities are, he says, just such accidents. Here we see the\r\npath opened, along which all scientific arrangement must proceed, if\r\nit is to exhibit real natural affinities; but at the same time there\r\nis a warning already of the error which beset systematic botany up to\r\nDarwin’s time; if in the above sentence we substitute the word idea\r\nfor that of substance, and the two expressions have much the same\r\nmeaning in the Aristotelian and Platonic view of nature, we recognise\r\nthe modern predarwinian doctrine, that species, genera, and families\r\nrepresent ‘ideam quandam’ and ‘quoddam supranaturale.’\r\n\r\nPursuing his deductions, Cesalpino next shows, that the most important\r\ndivisions, those of woody plants and herbs, must be maintained in\r\naccordance with the most important function of vegetation, that of\r\ndrawing up the food through root and shoot; this division passed from\r\nthe first and later on up to the time of Jung for an unassailable\r\ndogma, to which science simply had to conform. The second great\r\nfunction of plants is the producing their like, and this is effected\r\nby the parts of fructification. Though these parts are only found in\r\nthe more perfect forms, yet the subdivisions (‘posteriora genera’) must\r\nbe derived in both trees and herbs from likeness and unlikeness in the\r\nfructification. And thus Cesalpino was led, not by induction but by the\r\ndeductive path of pure Aristotelian philosophy, to the conclusion, that\r\nthe principles of a natural classification are to be drawn from the\r\norgans of fructification; for which conclusion Linnaeus declared him\r\nto be the first of systematists, while he thought de l’Obel and Kaspar\r\nBauhin, who founded their arrangements on the habit only, scarcely\r\ndeserving of notice.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that Cesalpino obtained the subdivisions which he\r\nfounded on the organs of fructification from _a priori_ views of the\r\ncomparative value of organs, such as run through all Aristotelian\r\nphilosophy. Of much interesting matter in the remainder of his\r\nintroduction we must mention only that he makes the highest product\r\nof plants to be the fructification, of animals sense and movement,\r\nof man the intellect; and because the latter stands in need of no\r\nspecial bodily instruments, there is no specific difference in men, and\r\ntherefore only one species of man.\r\n\r\nIn his 14th chapter he gives in broad outline a view of the system\r\nof plants which he founded on the fructification, beginning with the\r\nleast perfect; no one who knows the botanical writers of the 17th and\r\n18th centuries will be surprised to find that Cesalpino admits the\r\ndoctrine of ‘generatio spontanea’ in the case of the lower plants, and\r\nin a somewhat crude form; this came from the teaching of Aristotle, and\r\neven a hundred years later Mariotte endeavoured to set up a plausible\r\ndefence of spontaneous generation on physical grounds even in highly\r\ndeveloped plants.\r\n\r\n‘Some plants,’ says Cesalpino, ‘have no seed; these are the most\r\nimperfect, and spring from decaying substances; they have only\r\ntherefore to feed themselves and grow, and are unable to produce their\r\nlike; they are a sort of intermediate existences between plants and\r\ninanimate nature. In this respect Fungi resemble Zoophytes, which are\r\nintermediate between plants and animals, and of the same nature are the\r\nLemnae, Lichenes, and many plants which grow in the sea.’\r\n\r\nSome on the other hand produce seed, which they form after their\r\npeculiar nature in an imperfect condition, as the mule among animals;\r\nthese are of the same nature as mere monstrosities or diseased growths\r\nof other plants, and many occur in the class of grain and bear empty\r\nears. Cesalpino is evidently speaking of the Ustilagineae, but he\r\nincludes also the Orobancheae and Hypocystis, which instead of seed\r\ncontain only a powder; and he adds that some of the more perfect plants\r\nare sterile, but they do not belong to this division, because the\r\npeculiarity is confined in their case to individuals.\r\n\r\nSome plants bear a substance, a kind of wool, on the leaves, which to\r\nsome extent answers to seed, because it serves to propagate the plant;\r\nsuch plants have neither stem, flower, nor true seed, and the Ferns\r\nare of this kind. We should notice this conclusion from Cesalpino’s\r\nmorphology, that plants without true seeds have also no stem; the view\r\nthat ferns have no stems continued to be held by later botanists,\r\nthough the original reason for it was gradually lost; and those who in\r\nthe middle of the 19th century argued still in favour of this opinion,\r\nlittle suspected that they were endeavouring to establish a dogma of\r\nthe Aristotelian philosophy. It is a similar case to that of the crown\r\nof the root mentioned above. But other plants, continues Cesalpino,\r\nproduce true seeds; and he proceeds to treat of this division first,\r\non account of its great extent as comprising all perfect plants. Three\r\nthings, he says, contribute especially to the constitution of organs,\r\nthe number, position, and shape of the parts; the play of nature in the\r\ncomposition of fruits varies according to their differences, and hence\r\narise the different divisions of plants. He then shows how he proposes\r\nto apply these relations to the framing of his system, but his various\r\npoints of view may be omitted here, as they can be better and more\r\nshortly gathered from the table below.\r\n\r\nOther marks to be derived from roots, stems, and leaves, may be used,\r\nhe says, for forming the smaller divisions. Lastly, some marks which\r\ncontribute to the constitution neither of the whole plant nor of the\r\nfruit, such as colour, smell, taste, are mere accidents and are due to\r\ncultivation, place of growth, climate, and other causes.\r\n\r\nThe first of Cesalpino’s sixteen books ends with this general view of\r\nhis system. The remaining fifteen books contain about 600 pages of\r\ndescriptions of individual plants arranged in fifteen classes; some of\r\nthe descriptions are exceedingly minute; the trees come first, and are\r\nfollowed by the shrubs on account of their affinity (‘ob affinitatem’).\r\nTwo things have interfered with the recognition and acceptance of this\r\nsystem; the omission of a general view to precede the text, and its\r\nappearance in the traditional form of books and chapters, such as we\r\nfind in de l’Écluse, Dodoens, and Bauhin, instead of in classes and\r\norders, though it is true that the headings and introductions to the\r\nseveral books contain the designations and general characteristics\r\nof the classes described in them. Linnaeus has done good service by\r\ngiving in his ‘Classes Plantarum’ a general view of all the systems\r\nproposed before his time, among which he gives the first rank to that\r\nof Cesalpino; he has also pointed out the peculiar characteristics of\r\neach system, and has appended to the old names of the genera those with\r\nwhich he has himself made us familiar. This invaluable work, which is\r\na key to the understanding of the efforts that were made in systematic\r\nbotany from Cesalpino to Linnaeus himself, will often be referred to\r\nin later pages of this history; it will supply us here with a tabular\r\nview of Cesalpino’s main divisions as precisely formulated by Linnaeus,\r\nwhich is well worth the space it will occupy, as presenting the first\r\nplan proposed for a systematic arrangement of the vegetable kingdom,\r\nwith characters for each division. For the better understanding of\r\nthese diagnoses it should be remembered that the ‘cor’ (heart) is the\r\nimportant point in the seed with Cesalpino, and that it is the place in\r\nthe embryo where the radicle and the plumule unite, as has been said\r\nin a former page; Cesalpino himself says somewhat inexactly, the place\r\nfrom which the cotyledons spring.\r\n\r\nThe characters of the classes are given, for brevity’s sake, in Latin.\r\n\r\n\r\nARBOREAE\r\n\r\n(Arbores et frutices).\r\n\r\nI.

Flore fructuque carentes (Filices, Equiseta, Musci including\r\nCorals, Fungi).\r\n\r\nThe examples appended by me to the diagnoses show that with the\r\nexception of the sixth, tenth, and fifteenth classes, no one perfectly\r\nrepresents a natural group of the vegetable kingdom. Most of them\r\nare a collection of heterogeneous objects, and the distinction of\r\nDicotyledons and Monocotyledons, almost perfectly carried out by\r\nde l’Obel and Bauhin, is to a great extent effaced; the ninth class\r\ncertainly contains only Monocotyledons, but not all of them. This\r\nresult of great efforts on the part of a mind so well trained as\r\nCesalpino’s is highly unsatisfactory. Not a single new group founded\r\non natural affinities is established, which does not appear already in\r\nthe herbals of Germany and the Netherlands. It is characteristic of\r\nthe natural system to reveal itself to a certain extent more readily\r\nto instinctive perception than to the critical understanding. We have\r\nseen that Cesalpino intended as far as possible to give expression in\r\nhis system to natural affinities, and the final result was a series\r\nof highly unnatural groups, almost every one of which is a collection\r\nof the most heterogeneous forms. The cause of this apparently so\r\nremarkable fact is this, that he believed that he could establish on\r\npredetermined grounds the marks which indicate natural affinities. The\r\nuninterrupted labour of nearly 300 years, starting again and again\r\nfrom the same principle or practically under its influence, has given\r\nus inductive proof that the path taken by Cesalpino is the wrong one.\r\nAnd if, while this path was pursued even into the middle of the 18th\r\ncentury, we see natural groups emerge with increasing distinctness,\r\nit is because the botanist, though on the wrong track, was still\r\ncontinually gaining better acquaintance with the ground over which he\r\nwas wandering, and attained at length to an anticipation of the truer\r\nway.\r\n\r\nJOACHIM JUNG[20] was born in Lübeck in the year 1587, and died after an\r\neventful life in 1657. He was a contemporary of Kepler, Galileo, Vesal,\r\nBacon, Gassendi, and Descartes. After having been already a professor\r\nin Giessen, he applied himself to the study of medicine in Rostock,\r\nwas in Padua in 1618 and 1619, and there, as we may confidently\r\nbelieve, became acquainted with the botanical doctrines of Cesalpino,\r\nwho had died fifteen years before. Returning to Germany, he held\r\nvarious professorships during the succeeding ten years in Lübeck and\r\nHelmstädt, and became Rector of the Johanneum in Hamburg in 1629. He\r\noccupied himself with the philosophy of the day, in which he appeared\r\nas an opponent of scholasticism and of Aristotle, and also with various\r\nbranches of science, mathematics, physics, mineralogy, zoology, and\r\nbotany. In all these subjects he displayed high powers as a student\r\nand a teacher, and especially as a critical observer; in botany at\r\nleast he was a successful investigator. He was the first in Germany, as\r\nCesalpino had been in Italy, who combined a philosophically educated\r\nintellect with exact observation of plants.\r\n\r\nHis pupils were at first the only persons who profited by his botanical\r\nstudies, for with his many occupations and a perpetual desire to make\r\nhis investigations more and more complete he himself published nothing.\r\nIn 1662 his pupil Martin Fogel printed the ‘Doxoscopiae Physicae\r\nMinores,’ a work of enormous compass left in manuscript at the master’s\r\ndeath, and another pupil, Johann Vagetius, the ‘Isagoge Phytoscopica,’\r\nin 1678. Ray however tells us that a copy of notes on botanical\r\nsubjects had already reached England in 1660. The ‘Doxoscopiae’\r\ncontains a great number of detached remarks on single plants and on\r\ntheir distinguishing marks, and propositions concerning the methods and\r\nprinciples of botanical research,—all in the form of aphorisms which\r\nhe had from time to time committed to paper. The number and contents\r\nof these aphorisms show the earnest attention which he bestowed on\r\nthe determination of species; he is displeased that so many botanists\r\ndevote more time and labour to the discovery of new plants, than to\r\nreferring them carefully and logically to their true genera by means\r\nof their specific differences. He was the first who objected to the\r\ntraditional division of plants into trees and herbs, as not founded\r\non their true nature. But how firmly this old dogma was established\r\nis well shown by the fact, that Ray at the end of the century still\r\nretained this division, though he founded his botanical theories on\r\nthe ‘Isagoge’ of Jung. Jung was in advance of Cesalpino and his own\r\ncontemporaries in repeatedly expressing his doubt of the existence of\r\nspontaneous generation.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Isagoge Phytoscopica,’ a system of theoretical botany, very\r\nconcisely written and in the form of propositions arranged in strict\r\nlogical sequence, was a more important work and had more lasting\r\neffects upon the history of botany. We must look more closely into\r\nthe contents of this volume, because it contains the foundation of\r\nthe terminology of the parts of plants subsequently established by\r\nLinnaeus. Since the matter of the ‘Isagoge’ is produced in Ray’s\r\n‘Historia Plantarum’ in italics, with special mention of the source\r\nfrom which it is derived, it cannot be doubted that Linnaeus had made\r\nacquaintance with the teaching of Jung as a young man, in any case\r\nbefore 1738. It is as important as a matter of history to know that\r\nLinnaeus’ terminology is founded on Jung, as it is to learn that his\r\nmost general philosophical propositions on botanical subjects are to\r\nbe traced to Cesalpino. It will moreover be fully shown in the account\r\nof the doctrine of sexuality that his knowledge of that subject was\r\nderived from Rudolf Jacob Camerarius.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter of the ‘Isagoge’ discusses the distinction between\r\nplants and animals. A plant is, according to Jung, a living but not\r\na sentient body; or it is a body attached to a fixed spot or a fixed\r\nsubstratum, from which it can obtain immediate nourishment, grow and\r\npropagate itself. A plant feeds when it transforms the nourishment\r\nwhich it takes up into the substance of its parts, in order to replace\r\nwhat has been dissipated by its natural heat and interior fire. A\r\nplant grows when it adds more substance than has been dissipated,\r\nand thus becomes larger and forms new parts. The growth of plants is\r\ndistinguished from that of animals by the circumstance that their\r\nparts are not all growing at the same time, for leaves and shoots\r\ncease to grow as soon as they arrive at maturity; but then new leaves,\r\nshoots, and flowers are produced. A plant is said to propagate itself\r\nwhen it produces another specifically like itself; this is the idea in\r\nits broader acceptation. We see that here, as in Cesalpino, the idea of\r\nthe species is connected with that of propagation. The second chapter,\r\nheaded ‘Plantae Partitio,’ treats of the most important morphological\r\nrelations in the external differentiation of plants; here Jung adheres\r\nessentially to Cesalpino’s view, that the whole body in all plants,\r\nexcept the lowest forms, is composed of two chief parts, the root\r\nas the organ which takes up the food, and the stem above the ground\r\nwhich bears the fructification. Jung, too, draws attention to the\r\nmeeting-point of the two parts, Cesalpino’s ‘cor,’ but under the name\r\nof ‘fundus plantae.’\r\n\r\nThe upper part, or a portion of the plant, is either a stem, a leaf, a\r\nflower, a fruit, or a structure of secondary importance, such as hairs\r\nand thorns. His definition of the stalk and the leaf is noteworthy;\r\nthe stalk, he says, is that upper part which stretches upwards in\r\nsuch a manner, that a back and front, a right and left side, are not\r\ndistinguished in it. A leaf is that which is extended from its point\r\nof origin in height, or in length and breadth, in such a manner, that\r\nthe bounding surfaces of the third dimension are different from one\r\nanother, and therefore the outer and inner surfaces of the leaf are\r\ndifferently organised. The inner side of the leaf, which is also called\r\nthe upper, is that which looks towards the stem, and is therefore\r\nconcave or less convex than the other side. One conclusion he draws,\r\nwhich is a striking one for that time, that the compound leaf is taken\r\nfor a branch by inexperienced or negligent observers, but that it may\r\neasily be determined by having an inner and an outer surface, like the\r\nsimple leaf, and by falling off as a whole in autumn. He calls a plant\r\n‘difformiter foliata,’ whose lower leaves are strikingly different\r\nfrom the upper, an idea which Goethe, in the fragment in Guhrauer,\r\nseems to have altogether misunderstood.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these general definitions, the different forms of\r\nthe stem and of the ramification, and the varieties of leaves are\r\npointed out and supplied with distinctive names, which are for the\r\nmost part still in use. The fourth chapter treats of the division\r\nof the stem into internodes; if the stem or branch, says Jung, is\r\nregarded as a prismatic body, the articulations, that is, the spots\r\nwhere a branch or a leaf-stalk arises, are to be conceived of as\r\ncross-sections parallel to the base of the prism. These spots when they\r\nare protuberant are called knees or nodes, and that which lies between\r\nsuch spots is an internode.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to quote all the many excellent details which follow\r\nthese definitions; but some notice must be taken of Jung’s theory of\r\nthe flower, which he gives at some length from the 13th to the 27th\r\nchapters. It suffers, as in Cesalpino, from his entire ignorance of\r\nthe difference of sexes in plants, which is sufficient to render any\r\nsatisfactory definition of the idea of a flower impossible. Like\r\nCesalpino too he distinguishes the pistil from the flower, instead\r\nof making it a part of the flower. He regards the flower as a more\r\ndelicate part of the plant, distinguished by colour or form, or by\r\nboth, and connected with the young pistil. Like all botanists up to the\r\nend of the 18th century, he follows Cesalpino in including under the\r\nterm fruit both the dry indehiscent fruits which were supposed to be\r\nnaked seeds, and any seed-vessel. He differs from him in calling the\r\nstamens ‘stamina,’ and the style ‘stilus,’ but like Cesalpino he uses\r\nthe word ‘folium’ for the corolla. He calls a flower perfect only when\r\nit has all these three parts. He afterwards describes the relations of\r\nform and number in the parts of the flower, and among other things he\r\nenunciates the first correct view of the nature of the capitulum in\r\nthe Compositae, which Cesalpino quite misunderstood; and he examined\r\ninflorescences and superior and inferior flowers, which Cesalpino\r\nhad already distinguished, with more care than they had previously\r\nreceived. In his theory of the seed he follows Cesalpino, and adds\r\nnothing to him.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing which more essentially distinguishes the theoretical\r\nbotany of Jung, and marks the advance which he made upon Cesalpino’s\r\nviews, than the way in which he discusses morphology in as entire\r\nindependence as was possible of all physiological questions, and\r\ntherefore abstains from teleological explanations. His eye is fixed\r\non relations of form only, while his mode of treating them is\r\nessentially comparative, and embraces the whole of the vegetable\r\nkingdom that was known to him. Jung certainly learnt much from\r\nCesalpino; but in rejecting at least the grosser aberrations of the\r\nAristotelian philosophy and of scholasticism, he freed himself from\r\nthe prepossessions of his master, and succeeded in arriving at more\r\ncorrect conceptions of the morphology of plants. That his mathematical\r\ngifts assisted him in this respect is easy to be gathered from his\r\ndefinitions as given above, which bring into relief the symmetry\r\napparent in the forms of stems and leaves. No more profound or apt\r\ndefinitions were supplied till Schleiden and Nägeli introduced the\r\nhistory of development into the study of morphology.\r\n\r\nWhile Cesalpino, Kaspar Bauhin, and Jung stand as solitary forms each\r\nin his own generation, the last thirty years of the 17th century are\r\nmarked by the stirring activity of a number of contemporary botanists.\r\nWhile during this period physics were making rapid advances in the\r\nhands of Newton, philosophy in those of Locke and Leibnitz, and the\r\nanatomy and physiology of plants by the labours of Malpighi and Grew,\r\nsystematic botany was also being developed, though by no means to\r\nthe same extent or with equally profound results, by Morison, Ray,\r\nBachmann (Rivinus), and Tournefort. The works of these men and of their\r\nless gifted adherents, following rapidly upon or partly synchronous\r\nwith each other, led to an exchange of opinions and sometimes to\r\npolemical discussion, such as had not before arisen on botanical\r\nsubjects; this abundance of literature, with the increased animation\r\nof its style, excited a more permanent interest, which spread beyond\r\nthe narrow circle of the professional adepts. The systematists\r\nabove-named endeavoured to perfect the morphology and the terminology\r\nof the parts of plants, and they found ready to their hands in the\r\nworks of their predecessors a considerable store of observations and\r\nideas, upon which they set themselves to work. A very great number\r\nof descriptions of individual plants had been accumulated since the\r\ntime of Fuchs and Bock, and the fact of natural affinity had been\r\nrecognised in the ‘Pinax’ of Kaspar Bauhin as the foundation of a\r\nnatural system; Cesalpino had pointed to the organs of fructification\r\nas the most important for such a system, and Jung had supplied the\r\nfirst steps to a comparative morphology in place of a mere explanation\r\nof names. The botanists of the last thirty years of the 17th century\r\ncould not fail to perceive that the series of affinities as arranged\r\nby de l’Obel and Bauhin could not be defined by predetermined marks\r\nin the way pursued by Cesalpino, nor fashioned in this way into a\r\nwell-articulated system. Nevertheless they held fast in principle to\r\nCesalpino’s mode of proceeding, though they endeavoured to amend it\r\nby obtaining their grounds of division, not as he had done, chiefly\r\nfrom the organisation of the seed and fruit, but from other parts of\r\nthe flower; variations in the corolla, the calyx, and the general\r\nhabit were employed to found systems, which were intended to exhibit\r\nnatural affinities. And while the true means were thus missed, the end\r\nitself was not clearly and decidedly adhered to; a system was desired\r\nfor the purpose of facilitating the acquisition of a knowledge of\r\nthe greatest possible number of individual forms; the weight of the\r\nburden caused by the foolish demand that every botanist should know\r\nall described plants, was continually increasing, and naturally led to\r\nseeking some alleviation in systematic arrangement. Excessive devotion\r\nto the describing of plants stood in the way of such a profound study\r\nof the principles of systematic botany as might have led to enduring\r\nresults, and even destroyed the very capacity for those difficult\r\nintellectual operations, which were absolutely necessary to build\r\nup a truly natural system on scientific foundations; the wood could\r\nnot be seen for the trees. Above all the morphology founded by Jung,\r\nthough acknowledged and employed, was not sufficiently developed by the\r\nlabours of others to form the foundation of the system in its grander\r\nfeatures,—a reproach which must be made against the systematists of the\r\nsucceeding hundred years with few exceptions. How could the botanists\r\nof the 17th century succeed in acquiring a true conception of the\r\nlarger groups indicated by natural affinity, when they still held to\r\nthe old division into trees and herbs, which Jung had already set\r\naside and which is opposed to all consistent morphology, and when they\r\npaid so little attention to the structure of the seed and the fruit,\r\nthat they commonly treated dry indehiscent fruits as naked seeds, and\r\nwere guilty of other and similar mistakes? But if nothing new and good\r\nin principle found its way into systematic botany, much service was\r\nrendered to it in matters of detail. The working out of various systems\r\nhelped to show what marks are not admissible in fixing the limits of\r\nthe natural groups; the contradiction between the method and aim of the\r\nsystematists became in this empirical way continually more apparent,\r\ntill at length Linnaeus was able to recognise it distinctly; and this\r\nwas beyond doubt a great gain.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to give an account of all the systematists of England,\r\nFrance, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands during this period\r\nwould serve only to obscure the subject; all that is historically\r\nimportant will be brought out more clearly by mentioning those only\r\nwho have really enriched systematic botany. Whoever wishes for a more\r\ncomplete knowledge of all the systems which made their appearance\r\nbefore Linnaeus will find a masterly account of them in his ‘Classes\r\nPlantarum,’ and another worth consulting in Michel Adanson’s ‘Histoire\r\nde la Botanique’ (Paris, 1864). It is sufficient for our present\r\npurpose to consider more particularly the labours of the four men whose\r\nnames have recently been mentioned.\r\n\r\nROBERT MORISON[21], who was born in Aberdeen in 1620 and died in\r\nLondon in 1683, was the first after Cesalpino and Bauhin who devoted\r\nhimself to systematic botany, that is, to founding and perfecting the\r\nclassification of plants. He was reproached by his contemporaries\r\nand successors with having borrowed without acknowledgment from\r\nCesalpino; this was an exaggeration. Morison commenced his efforts as\r\na systematist with a careful examination of Kaspar Bauhin’s ‘Pinax’;\r\nthere he obtained his conceptions of natural relationship in plants;\r\nand if he afterwards founded his own system more peculiarly on the\r\nforms of the fruit, it was in a very different way from that adopted\r\nby Cesalpino. Linnaeus answers the reproach above-mentioned by the\r\npertinent remark, that Morison departs as far from Cesalpino in this\r\npoint as he is inferior to him in the purity of his method. In the year\r\n1669 appeared a work with the characteristic title, ‘Hallucinationes\r\nKaspari Bauhini in Pinace tum in digerendis quam denominandis plantis,’\r\nwhich Haller justly calls an ‘invidiosum opus’; for as there are\r\nwriters at all times who ungratefully accept all that is good and\r\nweighty in their predecessors as self-evident, while they point with\r\nmalicious pleasure to every little mistake which the originator of a\r\ngreat idea may commit, so Morison has no word of recognition for the\r\ngreat and obvious merits of the ‘Pinax,’ though such a recognition\r\nwas specially due from one whose design was to point out the numerous\r\nmistakes in that work on the subject of affinities. Kurt Sprengel in\r\nhis ‘Geschichte,’ ii. p. 30, also suspects with reason that Jung’s\r\nmanuscript, which was communicated by Hartlieb to Ray in 1661, was\r\nnot unknown to Morison, and in this paper he might certainly have\r\nfound much that suited his purposes. Sprengel says well, that the\r\n‘Hallucinationes’ are a well-grounded criticism of the arrangement of\r\nplants, which the Bauhins had chosen; that the writer goes through the\r\n‘Pinax’ page by page, and shows what plants occupy a false position,\r\nand that it is certain that Morison laid the first foundation of a\r\nbetter arrangement and a more correct discrimination of genera and\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nHis ‘Plantarum umbelliferarum distributio nova,’ Oxford, 1672, shows\r\nconsiderable advance; it is the first monograph which was intended to\r\ncarry out systematic principles strictly within the limits of a single\r\nlarge family. The very complex arrangement is founded exclusively on\r\nthe external form of the fruit, which he naturally terms the seed. It\r\nis the first work in which the system is no longer veiled by the old\r\narrangement in books and chapters, perspicuity being provided for by\r\ntypographical management,—an improvement which de l’Obel, it is true,\r\nmade a feeble attempt to introduce a hundred years before. Morison\r\nalso endeavours to give a clear idea of the systematic relations\r\nwithin the family by the aid of linear arrangement, to some extent\r\nthe first hint of what we now call a genealogical tree, and a proof\r\nat any rate of the lively conception which he had formed of affinity,\r\nnot drawn indeed only ‘ex libro naturae,’ as the title of his book\r\nstates, but in principle from Bauhin. Morison’s inability to appreciate\r\nthe merits of his predecessors, and to believe that when he made a\r\nstep in advance the way had ever been trodden before, may be seen in\r\nthis work also. One of its merits is, that it contains for the first\r\ntime careful representations of separate parts of plants, executed in\r\ncopper plate[22]. In 1680 appeared the first volumes of his ‘Historia\r\nplantarum universalis Oxoniensis,’ the third portion of which was\r\npublished after his death by Bobart in 1699,—a collection of most of\r\nthe plants then known and a large number of new ones with descriptions;\r\nthe systematic arrangement in this work is to be seen in Linnaeus’\r\n‘Classes Plantarum.’ If Morison in his criticism of Bauhin displayed\r\nconsiderable acuteness within narrow circles of affinity, his universal\r\nsystem on the contrary shows extremely small feeling for affinities\r\non the large scale; the most different forms are brought together\r\neven in the smaller divisions; the last class of his Bacciferae, for\r\nexample, contains genera like Solanum, Paris, Podophyllum, Sambucus,\r\nConvallaria, Cyclamen, a result which is the more surprising as Morison\r\ndoes not, like Cesalpino, confine himself to single fixed marks, but\r\nhas regard also to the habit. On the whole his arrangement as an\r\nexpression of natural affinities must be ranked after those of de\r\nl’Obel and Bauhin.\r\n\r\nMorison’s merit lay in truth less in the quality of what he did,\r\nthan in the fact that he was the first to renew the cultivation of\r\nsystematic botany on a comprehensive scale. The number of his adherents\r\nwas always small; in Germany Paul Ammann, Professor in Leipsic, adopted\r\nMorison’s views in his ‘Character Plantarum Naturalis’ (1685), and\r\nPaul Hermann, Professor in Leyden from 1679 to 1695, after collecting\r\nplants in Ceylon for eight years, proposed a system founded on that of\r\nMorison, but which can scarcely be called an improvement upon it.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Morison, JOHN RAY[23] (1628 to 1705) not only knew how\r\nto adopt all that was good and true in the works of his predecessors,\r\nand to criticise and complete them from his own observations, but could\r\nalso joyfully acknowledge the services of others, and combine their\r\nresults and his own into a harmonious whole. He wrote many botanical\r\nworks; but none display his character as a man and a naturalist better\r\nthan his comprehensive ‘Historia Plantarum,’ published in three large\r\nfolio volumes without plates in the period from 1686 to 1704. This\r\nwork contains a series of descriptions of all plants then known; but\r\nthe first volume commences with a general account of the science in\r\nfifty-eight pages, which, printed in ordinary size, would itself make a\r\nsmall volume, and which treats of the whole of theoretic botany in the\r\nstyle of a modern text-book. If morphology, anatomy, and physiology,\r\nin which latter subject he relies on the authority of Malpighi and\r\nGrew, are not kept strictly apart in his exposition, yet it is easy to\r\nseparate the morphological part, and his theory of systematic botany\r\nis in fact given separately. Jung’s definitions of the subject-matter\r\nof each of the chapters on morphology are first given, and Ray then\r\nadds his own remarks, in which he criticises, expands, and supplements\r\nthose of his predecessor. Omitting all that is not his own, and the\r\nanatomical and physiological portions, we will describe some of the\r\nmore important results of his studies on system. First and foremost Ray\r\nadopted the idea which Grew had conceived, but in a very clumsy form,\r\nthat difference of sex prevails in the vegetable kingdom, and hence\r\nthe flower had a different meaning and importance for him from what\r\nit had had for his predecessors, though his views on the subject were\r\nstill indistinct. Ray perceived more clearly than Cesalpino that many\r\nseeds contain not only an embryo but also a substance, which he calls\r\n‘pulpa’ or ‘medulla,’ and which is now known as the endosperm, and\r\nthat the embryo has not always two cotyledons, but sometimes only one\r\nor none; and though he was not quite clear as regards the distinction,\r\nwhich we now express by the words dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous\r\nembryo, yet he may claim the great merit of having founded the\r\nnatural system in part upon this difference in the formation of the\r\nembryo. He displays more conspicuously than any systematist before\r\nJussieu the power of perceiving the larger groups of relationship in\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, and of defining them by certain marks; these\r\nmarks moreover he determines not on _a priori_ grounds, but from\r\nacknowledged affinities; but it is only in the great divisions of\r\nhis system that he is thus true to the right course; in the details\r\nhe commits many and grievous offences against his own method, as we\r\nshall see below when we come to an enumeration of his classes. Modern\r\nwriters have often attributed to Ray the merit of having first taught\r\nthe transmutation of species, and of being thus one of the founders\r\nof the theory of descent. Let us see how much truth there is in this\r\nassertion. Though plants, says Ray, which spring from the same seed\r\nand produce their species again through seed, belong to the same\r\nspecies, yet cases may occur in which the specific character is not\r\nperpetual and infallible. Seeds may sometimes degenerate and produce\r\nplants specifically distinct from the mother-plant, though this may\r\nnot often happen, and so there would be a transmutation of species, as\r\nexperience teaches. It is true that he considered the statements of\r\nvarious writers, that Triticum may change into Lolium, Sisymbrium into\r\nMentha, Zea into Triticum, etc., to be very doubtful, yet there were,\r\nhe thought, other cases which were well ascertained; it was in evidence\r\nin a court of law that a gardener in London had sold cauliflower seed\r\nwhich had produced only common cabbage. It is to be observed, he says,\r\nthat such transmutations only occur between nearly allied species and\r\nsuch as belong to the same genus, and some perhaps would not allow that\r\nsuch plants are specifically distinct. These words, especially when\r\njudged by Ray’s general views, appear only to express the opinion that\r\ncertain inconsiderable variations are possible within a narrow circle\r\nof affinity, especially in cultivated plants. Ray does not speak of\r\nthe appearance of new forms, but says that a known form changes into\r\nanother already existing and known form, which is the reverse of that\r\nwhich the theory of descent requires.\r\n\r\nIn his development of the principles of his system, among other\r\nerrors we encounter one that leads to very important consequences in\r\nhis application of the dictum, ‘natura non facit saltus,’ which he\r\ninterprets as though all affinities must present themselves in a series\r\nthat would be represented by a straight line,—an error which has misled\r\nsystematists even in recent times, and was first recognised as an\r\nerror by Pyrame de Candolle. Ray overlooked the fact that the dictum\r\nholds good even when the affinities arrange themselves in the form of\r\nbranching series, that is, after the manner of a genealogical tree.\r\nMuch more sound is his remark, that the framing of the true system had\r\npreviously been impossible, because the differences and agreements of\r\nforms were not sufficiently known; and another saying of his, that\r\nnature refuses to be forced into the fetters of a precise system, shows\r\nthe dawn of the knowledge which afterwards led in Linnaeus to a strict\r\nseparation of the natural and artificial systems.\r\n\r\nIt excites no small astonishment after all Ray’s judicious and\r\nclear-sighted utterances on the nature and method of the natural system\r\nto find him adopting the division into woody plants and herbs; nor is\r\nthe matter improved by his making the distinctive mark of trees and\r\nshrubs to be the forming of buds, that is, distinct winter buds, which\r\nis a mistake into the bargain. Yet we feel ourselves in some degree\r\ncompensated for this serious error by his dividing trees and herbs into\r\nthose with a two-leaved and those with a one-leaved or leafless embryo,\r\nin modern language into Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons. Ray’s system\r\nis undoubtedly the one which in the time preceding Linnaeus does most\r\njustice to natural affinities. The following synopsis of his Classes\r\nwill serve to show the progress made since Cesalpino. The names in\r\nbrackets are the Linnaean names for some of the genera in particular\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. PLANTAE GEMMIS CARENTES (HERBAE).\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) _Imperfectae._\r\n\r\n  I. Plantae submarinae (chiefly Polypes, Fucus).\r\n  II. Fungi.\r\n  III. Musci (Confervae, Mosses, Lycopods).\r\n  IV. Capillares (Ferns, Lemna, Equisetum).\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) _Perfectae._\r\n\r\n\r\nDicotyledones (binis cotyledonibus).\r\n\r\n  V. Apetalae.\r\n  VI. Planipetalae lactescentes.\r\n  VII. Discoideae semine papposo.\r\n  VIII. Corymbiferae.\r\n  IX. Capitalae (vi-ix are Compositae).\r\n  X. Semine nudo solitario (Valerianeae, Mirabilis, Thesium, etc.).\r\n  XI. Umbelliferae.\r\n  XII. Stellatae.\r\n  XIII. Asperifoliae.\r\n  XIV. Verticillatae (Labiatae).\r\n  XV. Semine nudo polyspermo (Ranunculus, Rosa, Alisma!).\r\n  XVI. Pomiferae (Cucurbitaceae).\r\n  XVII. Bacciferae (Rubus, Smilax, Bryonia, Solanum, Menyanthes).\r\n  XVIII. Multisiliquae (Sedum, Helleboreae, Butomus, Asclepias).\r\n  XIX. Vasculiferae monopetalae (various).\r\n  XX. Vasculiferae dipetalae (various).\r\n  XXI. Tetrapetalae siliquosae (Cruciferae, Ruta, Monotropa).\r\n  XXII. Leguminosae.\r\n  XXIII. Pentapetalae vasculiferae enangiospermae (various).\r\n\r\n\r\nMonocotyledones (singulis aut nullis cotyledonibus).\r\n\r\n  XXIV. Graminifoliae floriferae vasculo tricapsulari (Liliaceae,\r\n        Orchideae, Zingiberaceae).\r\n  XXV. Stamineae (Grasses).\r\n  XXVI. Anomalae incertae sedis.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. PLANTAE GEMMIFERAE (ARBORES).\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) _Monocotyledones._\r\n\r\n  XXVII. Arbores arundinaceae (Palms, Dracaena).\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) _Dicotyledones._\r\n\r\n  XXVIII. Arbores fructu a flore remoto seu apetalae (Coniferae and\r\n          various others).\r\n  XXIX. Arbores fructu umbilicato (various).\r\n  XXX. Arbores fructu non umbilicato (various).\r\n  XXXI. Arbores fructu sicco (various).\r\n  XXXII. Arbores siliquosae (woody Papilionaceae).\r\n  XXXIII. Arbores anomalae (Ficus).\r\n\r\nOf these classes only the Fungi, Capillares, Stellatae, Labiatae,\r\nPomiferae, Tetrapetalae, Siliquosae, Leguminosae, Floriferae, and\r\nStamineae can pass as wholly or approximately natural groups, and\r\nthere are mistakes even in these; moreover the majority of them had\r\nlong been recognised. The examples annexed in brackets show how open\r\nthe others are to objection. If it must be allowed on the one side\r\nthat Ray, like Jung, doubts whether the Cryptogams are propagated\r\nwithout seeds, it is on the other side obvious that he makes as little\r\nobjection as his predecessors, contemporaries, and immediate successors\r\nto the idea that Polypes and Sponges are vegetables. But worse than\r\nthis is the extremely faulty subordination and coordination in his\r\nsystem; while the class of Mosses contains the Confervae, Lichens,\r\nLiverworts, Mosses, and Clubmosses, and therefore objects as distinct\r\nfrom one another as Infusoria, Worms, Crabs, and Mollusks, we find on\r\nthe contrary the one family of Compositae split up into four classes\r\nfounded on quite petty and unimportant differences. Finally, if Ray\r\nrecognised the general importance to the system of the leaf-formation\r\nin the embryo, he was still far from strictly separating all\r\nMonocotyledons and Dicotyledons.\r\n\r\nRay’s chief merit is that he to some extent recognised natural\r\naffinities in their broader features; the systematic separation of the\r\nsmaller groups was but little advanced by him. He too, like Morison,\r\nfound two adherents in Germany in the persons of Christopher Knaut\r\n(1638-1694), who published a flora of Halle in 1687 arranged after\r\nRay’s method, and Christian Schellhammer (1649-1716), professor at\r\nHelmstädt and afterwards at Jena.\r\n\r\nAUGUSTUS QUIRINUS BACHMANN (RIVINUS)[24] (1652-1725) was for Germany\r\nwhat Morison and Ray were for England, and Tournefort for France.\r\nFrom the year 1691 he was Professor of botany, physiology, materia\r\nmedica, and chemistry in Leipsic; he applied himself with such ardour\r\nto astronomy that he injured his eyesight by observing spots in the\r\nsun. With such a variety of occupations it is not surprising that his\r\nspecial knowledge of plants was inconsiderable when compared with\r\nthat of the three just named; but he was better able than they to\r\nappreciate the principles of morphology laid down by Jung, and to use\r\nthem for deciding questions of systematic botany. He did most service\r\nby his severe strictures on the more prominent errors which botanists\r\nup to his time had persisted in, his own positive contributions, at\r\nleast as far as the recognition of affinities is concerned, being\r\ninconsiderable. His ‘Introductio universalis in rem herbariam,’ which\r\nappeared in 1690, and contains 39 pages of the largest size, is the\r\nmost interesting for us; in it he declines the great quantity of\r\nunnecessary work with which botanists occupied themselves, and declares\r\nthe scientific study of plants to be the only end and aim of botany.\r\nHe first treats of naming, and lays down with respect to generic and\r\nspecific names the principles which Linnaeus afterwards consistently\r\napplied, whereas Bachmann himself did not follow his own precepts,\r\nbut injured his reputation as a botanist by a tasteless nomenclature.\r\nNevertheless he declared distinctly that the best plan is to designate\r\neach plant by two words, one of which should be the name of the genus,\r\nthe other that of the species, and he ingeniously pointed out the great\r\nconvenience of this binary nomenclature in dealing with medicinal\r\nplants, and in the writing of prescriptions. He refused to regard\r\ncultivated varieties as species, though Tournefort and others continued\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\nIn his system he rejected the division into trees, shrubs, and herbs,\r\nshowing by good examples that there is no real distinction of the kind\r\nin nature. From many of his remarks in his critical dissertations\r\nwe might infer that he possessed a very fine feeling for natural\r\nrelationship, but at the same time expressions occur which seem to\r\nshow that he did not at all appreciate its importance in the system;\r\nwe notice this in Tournefort also. Because flowers come before the\r\nfruit he jumps with curious logic to the conclusion that the main\r\ndivisions in the system should be derived from the flower, and in\r\nfollowing this rule he makes use of exactly that mark in the corolla\r\nwhich has the least value for classification, namely, regularity or\r\nirregularity of form. It is strange, moreover, that Bachmann, who spent\r\na considerable fortune on the production of copper-plate figures of\r\nplants without any special object, though he founded his system on\r\nthe form of the flower, should yet have devoted only a superficial\r\nstudy to its construction; his account of it is very inferior to that\r\nof any one before or since his time. His classification thus founded\r\ncannot be said to be an advance in systematic botany; nevertheless, he\r\nhad no lack of adherents, and among them in Germany, Heucher, Knaut,\r\nRuppius, Hebenstreit, and Ludwig; in England, Hill and others, who made\r\nalterations here and there in his system, but any real development of\r\nit was from its nature an impossibility; he endeavoured to defend it\r\nagainst the assaults of Ray and Dillen; Rudbeck also declared against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH PITTON DE TOURNEFORT[25] (1656-1708) founded his system also\r\non the form of the corolla, but his views are to some extent opposed\r\nto those of Bachmann. While the latter was pre-eminently critical and\r\ndeficient in knowledge of species, Tournefort was more inclined to\r\ndogmatise, and atoned in the eyes of his contemporaries for want of\r\nmorphological insight by his extensive acquaintance with individual\r\nplants. He is commonly regarded as the founder of genera in the\r\nvegetable kingdom; but it has been already shown that the conceptions\r\nof genera and species had been framed as early as the 16th century\r\nfrom the describing of plants, and that Kaspar Bauhin also, in naming\r\nhis plants, consistently distinguished genera and species; moreover\r\nBachmann in 1690 had supported the claims of the binary nomenclature\r\nas the most suitable for the designation of plants, though he did\r\nnot himself adopt it; Tournefort did adopt it, but in an entirely\r\ndifferent way from that of Bauhin. Bauhin gave only the name of the\r\ngenus, and supplied the species with characters; Tournefort, on the\r\nother hand, provided his genera with names and characters, and added\r\nthe species and varieties without special description. Tournefort\r\ntherefore was not the first who established genera; he merely\r\ntransferred the centre of gravity, so to speak, in descriptive botany\r\nto the definition of the genera; but in doing so he committed the great\r\nfault of treating specific differences within the genus as a matter\r\nof secondary importance. How little depth there was in his botanical\r\nideas may be seen not only from his very poor theory of the flower,\r\nthe imperfections in which, as in the case of Bachmann, are the more\r\nremarkable, since he founded his system on the outward form of the\r\nflower, but still more from the expression which he uses at the end of\r\nhis history of botany, a work otherwise of considerable merit; he says\r\nthere that the science of botany has been so far advanced since the\r\nage of Hippocrates, that hardly anything is still wanting except an\r\nexact establishing of genera. His general propositions on the subject\r\nof systematic botany, together with much that is good, but which is\r\ngenerally not new and is better expressed in the works of Morison, Ray,\r\nand Bachmann, contain strange misconceptions; for instance, he classes\r\nplants which have no flower and fruit with those in which these parts\r\nare to be seen only with the microscope, that is, the smallness of\r\nthe organs is equivalent to their absence. It may seem strange that\r\nhis theory of the flower should be so imperfect, when the excellent\r\ninvestigations of Malpighi and Grew into the structure of flowers,\r\nfruit, and seed were already before the world (1700), and Rudolph Jacob\r\nCamerarius had made known his discovery of sexuality in the vegetable\r\nkingdom. This doctrine, however, Tournefort expressly refused to admit.\r\nBut the reproach of neglecting the labours of Malpighi and Grew is\r\nequally applicable to Bachmann and the systematists up to A. L. de\r\nJussieu; we have here only the first example of the fact since so often\r\nconfirmed, that professed systematists shrank with a certain timidity\r\nfrom the results of more delicate morphological research, and rested\r\ntheir classifications as far as possible on obvious external features\r\nin plants,—a proceeding which more than anything else delayed the\r\nconstruction of the natural system.\r\n\r\nTournefort’s system is thoroughly artificial, if possible, more\r\nartificial than that of Bachmann, and certainly inferior to Ray’s.\r\nIf we meet with single groups that are really natural, it is simply\r\nbecause in some families the genera so agree together in all their\r\nmarks, that they necessarily remain united, whatever mark we select for\r\nthe systematic purpose. We do not find in Tournefort the distinction\r\nbetween Phanerogams and Cryptogams already established by Ray, nor\r\nthe division of woody plants and herbs into Monocotyledons and\r\nDicotyledons; if his chief work, to which we confine ourselves here,\r\nthe ‘Institutiones rei herbariae,’ did not bear the date of 1700, we\r\nmight conclude that it was written before the ‘Historia Plantarum’\r\nof Ray, and the chief work of Bachmann. Yet it has one merit of a\r\npurely formal kind; it is pervaded by a rigorous spirit of system;\r\nevery class is divided into sections, these into genera, and these\r\nagain into species; figures of the leaves and of the parts of the\r\nflower, very beautifully engraved on copper-plate and filling a whole\r\nvolume, are perspicuously arranged; the whole work therefore is easy\r\nto consult and understand. But to form an idea of the confusion as\r\nregards natural affinities that reigns in his system, we need only\r\nexamine the first three sections of his first class, when we shall find\r\nAtropa and Mandragora together in the first section, Polygonatum and\r\nRuscus in the second, Cerinthe, Gentiana, Soldanella, Euphorbia, and\r\nOxalis in the third. The handiness of the book, the little interest\r\ntaken by most of the botanists of the time in the question of natural\r\nrelationship, and the continually increasing eagerness for a knowledge\r\nof individual plants, are evidently the reasons why Tournefort gained\r\nover to his side most of the botanists not only of France, but also\r\nof England, Italy, and Germany; and why later attempts in systematic\r\nbotany during the first thirty or forty years of the 18th century were\r\nalmost exclusively founded on his system, as they were afterwards on\r\nthe sexual system of Linnaeus. Boerhaave, among others, proposed a\r\nsystem in 1710, which may be regarded as a combination of those of\r\nRay, Hermann, and Tournefort, but it met with no support on any other\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nWe here take our leave of the systematists of the 17th century, and,\r\npassing over the mere plant-collectors of the first thirty years of the\r\n18th, turn at once to Linnaeus.\r\n\r\nCARL LINNAEUS[26], called Carl von Linné after 1757, was born in 1707\r\nat Rashult in Sweden, where his father was preacher. He began the study\r\nof theology, but was soon drawn away from it by his preference for\r\nbotany, and in this pursuit he was encouraged by Dr. Rothmann, who sent\r\nhim to the works of Tournefort. In Lund, where he now studied medicine,\r\nhe became acquainted with Vaillant’s treatise, ‘De sexu plantarum,’ and\r\nhad his attention drawn by it to the sexual organs. In 1730, when he\r\nwas only twenty-three years old, the aged Professor Rudbeck gave up to\r\nhim his botanical lectures and the management of the botanic gardens,\r\nand here Linnaeus began the composition of the ‘Bibliotheca Botanica,’\r\nthe ‘Classes Plantarum,’ and the ‘Genera Plantarum.’ In the year 1732\r\nhe made a botanical journey to Lapland, and in 1734 to Dalecarlia; in\r\n1735 he went to Holland, where he obtained a degree; in that country\r\nhe remained three years, and printed the works above-named, together\r\nwith the ‘Systema Naturae,’ the ‘Fundamenta Botanica,’ and other\r\ntreatises. From Holland he visited England and France. In the year 1738\r\nhe returned to Stockholm and was compelled to gain a livelihood as a\r\nphysician, till in 1741 he became Professor of Botany in Upsala, where\r\nhe died in the year 1778.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus is commonly regarded as the reformer of the natural sciences\r\nwhich are distinguished by the term descriptive, and it is usual to say\r\nthat a new epoch in the history of our science begins with him, as a\r\nnew astronomy began with Copernicus, and new physics with Galileo. This\r\nconception of Linnaeus’ historical position, as far at least as his\r\nchief subject, botany, is concerned, can only be entertained by one who\r\nis not acquainted with the works of Cesalpino, Jung, Ray, and Bachmann,\r\nor who disregards the numerous quotations from them in Linnaeus’\r\ntheoretical writings. On the contrary, Linnaeus is pre-eminently the\r\nlast link in the chain of development represented by the above-named\r\nwriters; the field of view and the ideas of Linnaeus are substantially\r\nthe same as theirs; he shares with them in the fundamental errors of\r\nthe time, and indeed essentially contributed to transmit them to the\r\n19th century. But to maintain that Linnaeus marks not the beginning\r\nof a new epoch, but the conclusion of an old one, does not at all\r\nimply that his labours had no influence upon the time that followed\r\nhim. Linnaeus stands in the same relation to the systematists of the\r\nperiod we are considering that Kaspar Bauhin does to the botanists\r\nof the 16th century; as Bauhin gathered up all that was serviceable\r\nin his predecessors, Cesalpino only excepted, while the botanists of\r\nour second period drew again from him, though they set out from other\r\npoints of view than his; so Linnaeus adopted all that the systematists\r\nof the 17th century had built upon the foundation of Cesalpino’s ideas,\r\ngave it unity and fashioned it into a system without introducing into\r\nit anything that was fundamentally and essentially new; all that had\r\nbeen developed in systematic botany from Cesalpino to Tournefort\r\nculminated in him, and the results, which he put together in a very\r\noriginal form and with the power of a master, were no more unfruitful\r\nfor the further development of botany than the contents of Kaspar\r\nBauhin’s works for the successors of Cesalpino.\r\n\r\nWhoever carefully compares the works of Cesalpino, Jung, Morison, Ray,\r\nBachmann, and Tournefort with Linnaeus, ‘Fundamenta Botanica’ (1736),\r\nhis ‘Classes Plantarum’ (1738), and his ‘Philosophia Botanica’ (1751),\r\nmust be thoroughly convinced that the ideas on which his theories\r\nare based are to be found scattered up and down in the works of his\r\npredecessors; further, whoever has traced the history of the sexual\r\ntheory from the time of Camerarius (1694), must allow that Linnaeus\r\nadded nothing new to it, though he contributed essentially to its\r\nrecognition, and that even after Koelreuter’s labours he continued to\r\nentertain some highly obscure and even mystical notions on the subject.\r\n\r\nBut that which gave Linnaeus so overwhelming an importance for his own\r\ntime was the skilful way in which he gathered up all that had been done\r\nbefore him; this fusing together of the scattered acquisitions of the\r\npast is the great and characteristic merit of Linnaeus.\r\n\r\nCesalpino was the first who introduced Aristotelian modes of thought\r\ninto botany; his system was intended to be a natural one, but it was\r\nin reality extremely unnatural; Linnaeus, in whose works the profound\r\nimpression which he had received from Cesalpino is everywhere to be\r\ntraced, retained all that was important in his predecessor’s views, but\r\nperceived at the same time what no one before him had perceived, that\r\nthe method pursued by Cesalpino, Morison, Ray, Tournefort, and Bachmann\r\ncould never do justice to those natural affinities which it was their\r\nobject to discover, and that in this way only an artificial though very\r\nserviceable arrangement could be attained, while the exhibition of\r\nnatural affinities must be sought by other means.\r\n\r\nAs regards the terminology of the parts of plants, which was all that\r\nthe morphology of the day attempted, Linnaeus simply adopted all that\r\nwas contained in the Isagoge of Jung, but gave it a more perspicuous\r\nform, and advanced the theory of the flower by accepting without\r\nhesitation the sexual importance of the stamens, which was still but\r\nlittle attended to; he thus arrived at a better general conception of\r\nthe flower, and this bore fruit again in a terminology which is as\r\nclear as it is convenient; the terms monoecious, dioecious, triandrous,\r\nmonogynous, etc., still used in the science, and the later-invented\r\nexpressions dichogamous, protandrous, protogynous, etc., owe their\r\norigin to this correct conception of the sexual relations in plants.\r\nBut there was one great misconception in the matter, which has not a\r\nlittle contributed to increase Linnaeus’ reputation. He called his\r\nartificial system, founded on the number, union, and grouping of the\r\nstamens and carpels, the sexual system of plants, because he rested\r\nits supposed superiority on the fact, that it was founded upon organs\r\nthe function of which lays claim to the very highest importance. But\r\nit is obvious that the sexual system of Linnaeus would have the same\r\nvalue for the purposes of classification, if the stamens had nothing\r\nwhatever to do with propagation, or if their sexual significance were\r\nquite unknown. For it is exactly those characters of the stamens which\r\nLinnaeus employs for purposes of classification, their number and mode\r\nof union, which are matter of entire indifference as regards the sexual\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nBut though the notion that this artificial system has any important\r\nconnection with the doctrine of the sexuality of plants is evidently\r\ndue to a confusion of ideas, yet the progress of the science has shown,\r\nthat Linnaeus’ sexual system did often and necessarily lead to the\r\nestablishing of natural groups for the very reason, that the characters\r\nof the stamens which he employed are entirely independent of their\r\nfunction; for we must regard it as an important result of the labours\r\nof systematists, that those characters of organisms are shown to be of\r\nthe greatest value for classification, which are entirely or in a very\r\ngreat measure independent of the functions of the organs. The error,\r\nwhich led Cesalpino to make the functional importance of the parts of\r\nfructification the principle of his division, reappears therefore in\r\nLinnaeus in another form; to find a principle of division, he turns to\r\nthose organs, whose function appears to him the most important, but he\r\ntakes his characters not from differences of function, but from the\r\nnumber and mode of union, which are of no importance for the sexual\r\nfunction. We meet with this error in Leibnitz and Burckhard, who are\r\nmentioned here merely to defend Linnaeus from the charge repeatedly\r\nbrought against him by his contemporaries that he was indebted to these\r\ntwo writers for the idea of his sexual system. They erroneously found\r\nin the great physiological importance of the sexual organs a reason\r\nfor deriving from their differences the principles of division that\r\nwere to found a system; this error in theory Linnaeus shared with them,\r\nbut they did not correct it in practice, as Linnaeus did, by confining\r\nhimself to purely morphological features in working out his system.\r\nWhat the renowned philosopher[27] incidentally uttered in the year 1701\r\non the matter in question is moreover so unimportant and so indistinct,\r\nthat Linnaeus could not gain much from it; what Burckhard[28] says\r\non the subject in his often-quoted letter to Leibnitz (1702) is\r\nindeed much better, and comes near to Linnaeus’ idea; but it is a\r\nvery long way from the hints there given to the completion of the\r\nwell-articulated and highly practical system which Linnaeus constructed.\r\n\r\nThe botanists of the 16th century, and in the main even Morison\r\nand Ray, had in one-sided fashion devoted their chief attention to\r\ndistinguishing species, Bachmann and Tournefort to the establishment\r\nof generic characters, while they neglected species; Linnaeus, on the\r\ncontrary, applied equal care and much greater skill to describing both\r\ngenera and species. He reduced to practical shape the suggestion which\r\nBachmann had left to his successors, and so must be regarded, if not as\r\nthe inventor, at least as the real founder of the binary nomenclature\r\nof organisms.\r\n\r\nIt is only fulfilling the duty of a historian to state the sources\r\nfrom which Linnaeus drew, but it would be a misapprehension to see\r\nin this any depreciation of a great man; it were to be desired that\r\nall naturalists would, like Linnaeus, adopt all that is good in the\r\ncontributions of their predecessors, and improve or adapt it as\r\nhe did. Linnaeus himself has repeatedly quoted the sources of his\r\nknowledge as far as they were known to him, and has in many cases\r\nestimated the services of his predecessors with a candour which never\r\nbetrays a trace of jealousy, but often displays a warm respect, as\r\nmay be seen especially in the short introductions to the several\r\nsystems given in the ‘Classes Plantarum.’ Linnaeus could not only\r\nrecognise what was good in his predecessors and occasionally make\r\nuse of it, but he imparted life and fruitfulness to the thoughts of\r\nothers by applying them as he applied his own thoughts, and bringing\r\nout whatever theoretical value they possessed. It was evidently this\r\nfreshness of life that often misled his successors into believing that\r\nLinnaeus thought out and discovered everything for himself. We learn\r\nto appreciate the contributions of Cesalpino and his successors in the\r\n17th century, and even of Kaspar Bauhin for the first time in the works\r\nof Linnaeus; we are astonished to see the long-known thoughts of these\r\nwriters, which in their own place look unimportant and incomplete,\r\nfashioned by Linnaeus into a living whole; thus he was at once and in\r\nthe best sense both receptive and productive, and he might perhaps have\r\ndone more for the theory of the science if he had not been entangled\r\nin one grave error, which was more sharply pronounced in him than in\r\nhis predecessors and contemporaries, that, namely, of supposing that\r\nthe highest and only worthy task of a botanist is to know all species\r\nof the vegetable kingdom exactly by name. Linnaeus distinctly declared\r\nthat this was his view, and his school in Germany and England adhered\r\nto it so firmly that it established itself with the general public, who\r\nto the present day consider it as a self-evident proposition that a\r\nbotanist exists essentially for the purpose of at once designating any\r\nand every plant by a name. Like his predecessors, Linnaeus regarded\r\nmorphology and general theoretical botany only as means to be used for\r\ndiscovering the principles of terminology and definition, with a view\r\nto the improvement of the art of describing plants.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto spoken chiefly of the manner in which Linnaeus dealt\r\nwith his subject in matters of detail; in his inner nature he was a\r\nschoolman, and that in a higher degree than even Cesalpino himself,\r\nwho should rather be called an Aristotelian in the strict sense of\r\nthe word. But to say that Linnaeus’ mode of thought is thoroughly\r\nscholastic is virtually saying that he was not an investigator of\r\nnature in the modern meaning of the word; we might point to the fact\r\nthat Linnaeus never made a single important discovery throwing light on\r\nthe nature of the vegetable world; but that would still not prove that\r\nhe was a schoolman.\r\n\r\nTrue investigation of nature consists not only in deducing rules from\r\nexact and comparative observation of the phenomena of nature, but\r\nin discovering the genetic forces from which the causal connexion,\r\ncause and effect may be derived. In the pursuit of these objects,\r\nit is compelled to be constantly correcting existing conceptions\r\nand theories, producing new conceptions and new theories, and thus\r\nadjusting our own ideas more and more to the nature of things. The\r\nunderstanding does not prescribe to the objects, but the objects to\r\nthe understanding. The Aristotelian philosophy and its medieval form,\r\nscholasticism, proceeds in exactly the contrary way; it is not properly\r\nconcerned with acquiring new conceptions and new theories by means of\r\ninvestigation, for conceptions and theories have been once for all\r\nestablished; experience must conform itself to the ready-made system of\r\nthought; whatever does not so conform must be dialectically twisted and\r\nexplained till it apparently fits in with the whole. From this point\r\nof view the intellectual task consists essentially in this twisting\r\nand turning of facts, for the general idea of the whole is already\r\nmade and needs not to be altered. Experience in the higher sense of\r\ninvestigation of nature is rendered impossible by the fact, that we\r\nare supposed to know all the ultimate principles of things; but these\r\nultimate principles of scholasticism are at bottom only words with\r\nextremely indefinite meaning, abstractions obtained by a series of\r\njumps from every-day experience, which has not been tried and refined\r\nin the crucible of science, and is therefore worthless; and the higher\r\nthe abstraction is raised, the farther it withdraws from the guiding\r\nhand of experience, the more venerable and more important do these\r\n‘abstracta’ appear, and we can finally come to a mutual understanding\r\nabout them, though again only through figures and metaphors[29].\r\nScience, according to the scholastic method, is a playing with abstract\r\nconceptions; the best player is he who can so combine them together,\r\nthat the real contradictions are skilfully concealed. On the contrary,\r\nthe object of true investigation, whether in philosophy or in natural\r\nscience, is to make unsparing discovery of existing contradictions and\r\nto question the facts until our conceptions are cleared up, and if\r\nnecessary the whole theory and general view is replaced by a better.\r\nIn the Aristotelian philosophy and in scholasticism facts are merely\r\nexamples for the illustration of fixed abstract conceptions, but in the\r\nreal investigation of nature they are the fruitful soil from which new\r\nconceptions, new combinations of thought, new theories, and general\r\nviews spring and grow. The most pernicious feature in scholasticism\r\nand the Aristotelian philosophy is the confounding of mere conceptions\r\nand words with the objective reality of the things denoted by them;\r\nmen took a special pleasure in deducing the nature of things from the\r\noriginal meaning of the words, and even the question of the existence\r\nor non-existence of a thing was answered from the idea of it. This\r\nway of thinking is found everywhere in Linnaeus, not only where he\r\nis busy as systematist and describer, but where he wishes to give\r\ninformation on the nature of plants and the phenomena of their life,\r\nas in his ‘Fundamenta,’ his ‘Philosophia Botanica,’ and especially in\r\nhis ‘Amoenitates Academicae.’ From among many instances we may select\r\nhis mode of proving sexuality in plants. Linnaeus knew and lauded the\r\nservices rendered to botany by Rudolph Jacob Camerarius, who as a\r\ngenuine investigator of nature had demonstrated the sexuality of plants\r\nin the only possible way, namely, that of experiment. But Linnaeus\r\ncares little for this experimental proof; he just notices it in\r\npassing, and expends all his art on a genuine scholastic demonstration\r\nintended to prove the existence of sexuality as arising necessarily\r\nfrom the nature of the plant. He connects his demonstration with the\r\ndictum ‘omne vivum ex ovo,’ which Harvey had founded on an imperfect\r\ninduction, and which he evidently takes for an _a priori_ principle,\r\nand concludes from it that plants also must proceed from an ‘ovum,’\r\noverlooking the fact that in ‘omne vivum ex ovo’ plants already form\r\na half of the ‘omne vivum’; then he continues, ‘reason and experience\r\nteach us that plants proceed from an ‘ovum,’ and the cotyledons\r\nconfirm it’; reason, experience, and cotyledons! Surely a remarkable\r\nassemblage of proofs. In the next sentence he confines himself at first\r\nto the cotyledons, which according to him spring in animals from the\r\nyolk of the egg, in which the life-point is found; consequently, he\r\nsays, the seed-leaves of plants, which envelope the ‘corculum,’ are\r\nthe same thing; but that the progeny is formed not simply from the\r\n‘ovum,’ nor from the fertilising matter in the male organs, but from\r\nthe two combined, is shown by animals, hybrids, reason, and anatomy. By\r\nreason in this and the previous sentence he understands the necessity,\r\nconcluded from the nature, that is, the conception of the thing, that\r\nit must be so; animals supply him with the analogy, and anatomy can\r\nprove nothing, as long as it is not known what is the design of the\r\nanatomical arrangements. But the weakest side of this proof lies in the\r\nhybrids, for Linnaeus, when he wrote the ‘Fundamenta,’ knew of none\r\nexcept the mule; hybrids in plants were first described by Koelreuter\r\nin 1761, and these Linnaeus nowhere mentions; and what amount of proof\r\ncan be drawn from the vegetable hybrids, which Linnaeus afterwards\r\nsupposed himself to have observed, but which were no hybrids, we\r\nshall see in the history of the sexual theory; here we need only\r\nremark that he arrives at the existence of these hybrids from the\r\nidea of sexuality exactly as he arrived at that of sexuality from the\r\nidea of hybridisation. Then he goes on with his demonstration; ‘that\r\nan egg germinates without fecundation is denied by experience, and\r\nthis must hold good therefore of the eggs[30] of plants—every plant\r\nis provided with flower and fruit, even where these are not visible\r\nto the eye’; with Linnaeus, of course, this is logically concluded\r\nfrom the conception of the plant or of the ‘ovum’; he alleges indeed\r\ncertain observations as well, but they are incorrect. He continues,\r\n‘The fructification consists of the sexual organs of the flowers; that\r\nthe anthers are the male organs, the pollen the fertilising matter, is\r\nproved by their nature, further by the fact that the flower precedes\r\nthe fruit, as also by their position, the time, the loculaments\r\n(anthers), by castration, and by the structure of the pollen.’ Here too\r\nthe main point with Linnaeus is the nature of the male organs, and that\r\nwe may know what this nature is he refers to a former paragraph, where\r\nwe learn that the essence of the flower is in the anthers and stigma.\r\nAlmost all his demonstrations consist of such reasonings in a circle\r\nand in arguing from the thing to be proved. And while the passages\r\nquoted show how much he did for the doctrine of sexuality, we find\r\nthis sophistical style of reasoning still more copiously displayed in\r\nthe essay entitled ‘Sponsalia Plantarum’ in the ‘Amoenitates’ (i. p.\r\n77), and in a worse form still in the essay, ‘Plantae Hybridae’ (Amoen.\r\niii. p. 29). That Linnaeus had not the remotest conception of the way\r\nin which the truth of a hypothetical fact is proved on the principles\r\nof strict inductive investigation is shown by these and many other\r\nexamples, and by his enquiry into the seeds of mosses (Amoen. ii. p.\r\n266), upon which he prided himself not a little, but which is really\r\ninconceivably bad even for that time (1750). It was not Linnaeus’ habit\r\nto occupy himself with what we should call an enquiry; whatever escaped\r\nthe first critical glance he left quietly alone; it did not occur to\r\nhim to examine into the causes of the phenomena that interested him; he\r\nclassified them and had done with them; as for instance in his ‘Somnus\r\nPlantarum,’ as he called the periodical movements of plants. We cannot\r\nread much of the ‘Philosophia Botanica’ or the ‘Amoenitates’ without\r\nfeeling that we are transported into the literature of the middle ages\r\nby the kind of scholastic sophistry which is all that his argumentation\r\namounts to; and yet these works of Linnaeus date from the middle of\r\nthe last century, from a time when Malpighi, Grew, Camerarius, and\r\nHales had already carried out their model investigations, and his\r\ncontemporaries Duhamel, Koelreuter, and others were experimenting in\r\ntrue scientific manner. This peculiarity in Linnaeus explains why\r\nmen like Buffon, Albert Haller, and Koelreuter treated him with a\r\ncertain contempt; and also why his strict adherents in Germany, who\r\nlived on his writings and were unable to separate what was really\r\ngood in him from his mode of reasoning, came to make their own botany\r\nlike anything rather than a science of nature. Linnaeus was in fact a\r\ndangerous guide for weak minds, for his curious logic, among the worst\r\nto be met with in the scholastic writers, was combined with the most\r\nbrilliant powers of description; the enormous extent of his knowledge\r\nof particulars, and above all the pre-eminent firmness and certainty\r\nwhich distinguished his mode of dealing with systematic botany, could\r\nnot fail to make the profoundest impression on those who judged of\r\nthe powers of an investigator of nature by these qualities alone. One\r\nof his greatest gifts was without doubt the power which he possessed\r\nof framing precise and striking descriptions of species and genera in\r\nthe animal and vegetable kingdoms by means of a few marks contained in\r\nthe smallest possible number of words; in this point he was a model of\r\nunrivalled excellence to all succeeding botanists.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the superiority of Linnaeus lay in his natural gift for\r\ndiscriminating and classifying the objects which engaged his attention;\r\nhe might almost be said to have been a classifying, co-ordinating,\r\nand subordinating machine. He dealt with everything about which he\r\nwrote in the way in which he dealt with objects of natural history.\r\nThe systematic botanists whom he mentions in the ‘Classes Plantarum’\r\nare classified then and there as fructists, corollists, and calycists.\r\nAll who occupy themselves in any way with botany are divided into two\r\ngreat classes, the true botanists and mere botanophils, and it is\r\nvery characteristic of his way of thinking that he places anatomists,\r\ngardeners, and physicians in the latter class. True botanists again\r\nare either mere collectors or systematists. To the collectors\r\nbelong all who add to the number of known plants, also authors\r\nof monographs and floras, and the botanical explorers of foreign\r\ncountries, whom we should now more courteously call systematists. By\r\nsystematists Linnaeus understands those who occupy themselves with\r\nthe classification and naming of plants, and he divides them into\r\nphilosophers, systematists proper, and nomenclators; the philosophers\r\nare those who study the theory of the science on principles founded on\r\nreason and observation, and are subdivided into orators, institutors,\r\nerystics, and physiologists; the latter are those who discovered the\r\nmystery of sexuality in plants, and hence Malpighi, Hales, and such\r\nmen are not physiologists in Linnaeus’ sense. The second class of\r\nsystematists, the systematists proper, he distinguishes into orthodox\r\nand heterodox, the former taking the grounds of division exclusively\r\nfrom the organs of fructification, while the latter use other marks\r\nas well. In this manner Linnaeus treats every subject of which he has\r\nto speak, and wherever he can in short, numbered sentences, which\r\nlook like descriptions of genera and species. His mind and character\r\nwere fully formed in 1736 when he wrote his ‘Fundamenta,’ and he\r\npreserved his peculiarities of style from that time forward; we find\r\nthe same modes of expression in the ‘Nemesis Divina,’ a treatise on\r\nreligion and morals addressed as a legacy to his son. Where these\r\npeculiarities of manner and expression are suitable they make a\r\nfavourable impression on the reader, as for instance in the short\r\naccounts he gives of the various systems in the ‘Classes Plantarum,’\r\na work in which Linnaeus was quite in his element; there he traces\r\nwith a fine instinct the guiding principles of each system, pronounces\r\nupon its merits and defects, and sets it before the reader in numbered\r\nsentences of epigrammatic brevity. This manner is strictly adhered to\r\nin the ‘Philosophia’ also, and it has certainly helped not a little\r\nto withdraw the attention of his reader from his many fallacies in\r\nargument, especially his oft-recurring reasonings in a circle.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable combination of an unscientific philosophy with mastery\r\nover the classification of things and conceptions, this mixture of\r\nconsistency in carrying out his scholastic principles with gross\r\ninaccuracies of thought, impart to his style an originality, which is\r\nrendered still more striking by the native freshness and directness,\r\nand not unfrequently by the poetic feeling, which animate his periods.\r\n\r\nIn any attempt to estimate the advance which the science owes to the\r\nlabours of Linnaeus, the chief prominence must be assigned to two\r\npoints; first to his success in carrying out the binary nomenclature in\r\nconnection with the careful and methodical study which he bestowed on\r\nthe distinguishing of genera and species; this system of nomenclature\r\nhe endeavoured to extend to the whole of the then known vegetable\r\nworld, and thus descriptive botany in its narrower sense assumed\r\nthrough his instrumentality an entirely new form, which, serving as\r\na model for the naming and defining of the larger groups, could be\r\napplied without modification to the founding and completing the natural\r\nsystem. When at a later time Jussieu and De Candolle marked out their\r\nfamilies and groups of families, their mode of proceeding was in the\r\nmain that of Linnaeus when distinguishing his genera by abstraction of\r\nspecific differences. This merit has been always assigned to Linnaeus\r\nwithout reserve. The second merit has been less recognised, and yet it\r\nis at least of equal importance; it is that of having first perceived\r\nthat the attempt made by Cesalpino and his successors to found a\r\nsystem, that shall do justice to natural affinities, on predetermined\r\nmarks can never succeed. Linnaeus framed his artificial sexual system,\r\nbut he exhibited a fragment of a natural system by its side, while he\r\nrepeatedly declared that the chief task of botanists is to discover\r\nthe natural system. Thus he cleared the ground for systematic botany.\r\nHe made use of his own system, because it was extremely convenient for\r\ndescribing individual plants, but he ascribed all true scientific value\r\nexclusively to the natural system; and with what success he laboured\r\nto advance it may be gathered from the fact, that Bernard de Jussieu\r\nfounded his improved series of families on the fragment of Linnaeus,\r\nand that his nephew, A. L. de Jussieu, by simply adopting Linnaeus’\r\nconception of the principle which lies at the foundation of the natural\r\nsystem, succeeded in carrying it on to a further stage of development.\r\n\r\nThe main features of Linnaeus’ theoretical botany can best be learned\r\nfrom the ‘Philosophia Botanica,’ which may be regarded as a text-book\r\nof that which Linnaeus called botany, and which far surpasses all\r\nearlier compositions of the kind in perspicuity and precision, and\r\nin copiousness of material; and indeed it would be difficult to find\r\nin the ninety years after 1781 a text-book of botany which treats\r\nwhat was known on the subject at each period with equal clearness\r\nand completeness. In giving the reader some idea of the way in which\r\nLinnaeus deals with his subject, it will be well to pass over the\r\nfirst two chapters, which discuss the literature and the various\r\nsystems which had been proposed, and turn to the third, which under\r\nthe heading ‘Plantae’ treats of the general nature of plants, and\r\nspecially of the organs of vegetation. The vegetable world, says\r\nLinnaeus, comprises seven families, Fungi, Algae, Mosses, Ferns,\r\nGrasses, Palms, and Plants. All are composed of three kinds of vessels,\r\nsap-vessels which convey the fluids, tubes which store up the sap\r\nin their cavities, and tracheae which take in air; these statements\r\nLinnaeus adopts from Malpighi and Grew. He gives no characteristic\r\nmarks for the Fungi; of the Algae he says that in them root, leaf,\r\nand stem are all fused together; to the Mosses he ascribes an anther\r\nwithout a filament, and separate from the female flower which has no\r\npistil; the seeds of the Mosses have no integument or cotyledons;\r\nthis characteristic of the Mosses is explained in his paper entitled\r\n‘Semina Muscorum’ in the ‘Amoenitates Academicae,’ ii. The Ferns are\r\nmarked by the fructification on the under side of the fronds, which\r\nare therefore not conceived of as leaves. The very simple leaves, the\r\njointed stalk, the ‘calyx glumosus,’ and the single seed mark the\r\nGrasses. The simple stem, the rosette of leaves at the summit, and\r\nthe spathe of the inflorescence are characteristic of the Palms. All\r\nvegetable forms which do not belong to any of the previous families he\r\nnames Plants. He rejects the customary division into herbs, shrubs,\r\nand trees as unscientific. This arrangement of the vegetable kingdom\r\nmust not be confounded with Linnaeus’ fragment of a natural system,\r\nin which he adopts sixty-seven families (orders), the Fungi, Algae,\r\nMosses, and Ferns forming each a family. He evidently introduces the\r\ndivisions in the ‘Philosophia,’ in order that it may be seen how far\r\nthe statements that follow are applicable to all the Vegetabilia or\r\nonly to certain sections of them. The parts in the individual plant\r\nwhich the beginner must distinguish are three; the root, the herb[31],\r\nand the parts of fructification, in which enumeration Linnaeus departs\r\nfrom his predecessors, by whom the fructification and the herb together\r\nare opposed to the root. In the central part of the plant is the\r\npith, enclosed by the wood which is formed from the bast; the bast\r\nis distinct from the rind, which again is covered by the epidermis;\r\nthese anatomical facts are from Malpighi; the statement that the pith\r\ngrows by extending itself and its envelopes is borrowed from Mariotte.\r\nCesalpino’s view on the formation of the bud is expressed by Linnaeus\r\nin the statement, that the end of a thread of the pith passing through\r\nthe rind is resolved into a bud, etc. The bud is a compressed stem,\r\ncapable of unlimited extension till fructification puts a term to\r\nvegetation. The fructification is formed by the leaves uniting into a\r\ncalyx, from which the apex of a branch issues as a flower about one\r\nyear in advance, while the fruit arising from the substance of the\r\npith cannot begin a new life till the woody substance of the stamens\r\nhas been absorbed by the fluids of the pistil. In this way Linnaeus\r\ncorrected Cesalpino’s theory of the flower, that he might take into\r\naccount the sexual importance of the stamens discovered by Camerarius.\r\nHe concludes by saying that there is no new creation but only a\r\ncontinuous generation, for which he gives the remarkable and thoroughly\r\nCesalpinian reason, ‘cum corculum seminis constat parte radicis\r\nmedullari.’\r\n\r\nThe root, which takes up the food, and produces the stem and the\r\nfructification, consists of pith, wood, bast, and rind, and is divided\r\ninto the two parts, ‘caudex’ and ‘radicula.’ The ‘caudex’ answers\r\npretty nearly to our primary root and rhizomes, the ‘radicula’ to what\r\nwe now call secondary roots.\r\n\r\nThe herb springs from the root, and is terminated by the\r\nfructification; it consists of the stem, leaves, leaf-supports\r\n(‘fulcrum’), and the organs of hibernation (‘hibernaculum’). Then\r\nfollow the further distinctions of stem and leaves; the terminology,\r\nstill partly in use and resting essentially on the definitions of\r\nJung, is here set forth in great detail. Linnaeus however does not\r\nmention the remarkable distinction between stem and leaf which Jung\r\nfounded on relations of symmetry, and in general he shows less depth of\r\nconception than Jung, confining himself more to the direct impression\r\non the senses, and so distinguishing sometimes where there is no real\r\ndifference. Examples of this are furnished by the paragraph devoted\r\nto ‘fulcra.’ By this term he designates the subsidiary organs of\r\nplants, among which he reckons stipules, bracts, spines, thorns,\r\ntendrils, glands, and hairs. It appears from this, that Linnaeus did\r\nnot extend the idea of the leaf (‘folium’) to stipules and bracts, and\r\nthe examples he gives of tendrils show at the same time that he was\r\nignorant of the different morphological character of the organ in Vitis\r\nand Pisum. The putting the seven organs above-named together under the\r\nidea of ‘fulcrum’ shows plainly enough that Linnaeus, in framing his\r\nterminology, aimed only at distinguishing what was different to the\r\nsense by fixed words, in order to obtain means for short diagnoses\r\nof species and genera. He had no thought of arriving at more general\r\npropositions from a comparison of forms in plants, in order to attain\r\nto a deeper insight into their nature. The same thing appears from his\r\nnotion of ‘hibernaculum,’ by which he understands a part of the plant\r\nwhich envelopes the stem in its embryonal state and protects it from\r\nharm from without; he here distinguishes bulbs from the winter buds of\r\nwoody plants. In this course of mixing up morphological and biological\r\nrelations of organs he was followed by botanists till late into our own\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus goes far beyond his predecessors in distinguishing and naming\r\nthe organs of fructification, the subject of the fourth chapter of the\r\n‘Philosophia Botanica.’ The fructification, he says, is a temporary\r\npart in plants devoted to propagation, terminating the old and\r\nbeginning the new. He distinguishes the following seven parts: (1) the\r\ncalyx, which represents the rind, including in this term the involucre\r\nof the Umbelliferae, the spathe, the calyptra of Mosses, and even the\r\nvolva of certain Fungi,—another instance of the way in which Linnaeus\r\nwas guided by external appearance in his terminology of the parts of\r\nplants; (2) the corolla, which represents the inner rind (bast) of the\r\nplant; (3) the stamen, which produces the pollen; (4) the pistil, which\r\nis attached to the fruit and receives the pollen; here for the first\r\ntime the ovary, style, and stigma are clearly distinguished. But next\r\ncomes as a special organ (5) the pericarp, the ovary which contains\r\nthe seed. As bulbs and buds were treated not simply as young shoots,\r\nbut as separate organs, so here too the ripe fruit is regarded not\r\nmerely as the developed ovary, but as a special organ. Nevertheless,\r\nLinnaeus distinguishes the different forms of fruit much better than\r\nhis predecessors had done. (6) The seed is a part of the plant that\r\nfalls off from it, the rudiment of a new plant, and it is excited to\r\nactive life by the pollen. The treatment of the seed and its parts is\r\nthe feeblest of all Linnaeus’ efforts; he follows Cesalpino, but his\r\naccount of the parts of the seed is much more imperfect than that of\r\nCesalpino and his successors. The embryo is called the ‘corculum,’ and\r\ntwo parts are distinguished in it, the ‘plumula’ and the ‘rostellum’\r\n(radicle). The cotyledon is co-ordinated with the ‘corculum,’ and is\r\nregarded therefore not as part of the embryo but as a distinct organ of\r\nthe seed; it is defined as ‘corpus laterale seminis bibulum caducum.’\r\nNothing could be worse, and it seems almost incredible that so bad a\r\ndefinition and distinction could be given in 1751, and again in 1770,\r\nby the first botanist of his time, when Malpighi and Grew, nearly\r\na hundred years earlier, had illustrated the parts of the seed and\r\neven the history of its development and its germination by numerous\r\nfigures. He does not mention the endosperm, evidently confounding it\r\nwith the cotyledon, though Ray had already distinguished it clearly\r\nfrom the other parts of the seed. Linnaeus’ terminology of the seed\r\nsupplies more than sufficient corroboration of our previous remark,\r\nthat he shows incapacity for the careful investigation of any object\r\nat all difficult to observe, and it will now seem a small matter that\r\nhe, like most of the earlier botanists, treats one-seeded indehiscent\r\nfruits as seeds, and hence makes the pappus a part of the seed. (7) By\r\nthe word ‘receptaculum’ he understands everything by which the parts\r\nof the fructification are connected together, both the ‘receptaculum\r\nproprium,’ which unites the parts of the single flower, and the\r\n‘receptaculum commune,’ under which term he comprises the most diverse\r\nforms of inflorescence (umbel, cyme, spadix).\r\n\r\nHe concludes with the remark that the essence of the flower consists in\r\nthe anther and the stigma, that of the fruit in the seed, that of the\r\nfructification in the flower and the fruit, and that of all vegetable\r\nforms in the fructification, and he adds a long list of distinctions\r\nbetween the organs of fructification with their names; among these\r\norgans appear the nectaries, which he was the first to distinguish.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth chapter he discusses the question of difference of sex\r\nin plants. His views on this subject have been already mentioned in\r\norder to show that they were entirely founded on worthless scholastic\r\ndeductions; here we may quote a few of the propositions which were\r\nfamous in after times. We assume, he says, that two individuals of\r\ndifferent sexes were created in the beginning of things in every kind\r\nof living creatures. Plants, though they are without sensation, yet\r\nlive as do animals, for they have a beginning and an advance in age\r\n(aetas), and are liable to disease and death; they have also a power\r\nof movement, a natural appetency (propulsio), an anatomy, and an\r\norganic structure (organismus). Simple explanations are given of these\r\nwords, but they prove nothing about the matter. He then expounds the\r\nwhole theory of sexuality, which is made to rest entirely on scholastic\r\narguments, and in doing this he spins out to excessive length the\r\nparallel which he draws between the conditions of sexuality in\r\nanimals and plants. It is manifestly this chapter of the ‘Philosophia\r\nBotanica,’ together with the treatise ‘Sponsalia Plantarum,’ which led\r\nthe adherents of Linnaeus, who were ignorant of the older literature\r\nof the subject and were much impressed by his scholastic dexterity, to\r\ncelebrate him as the founder of the sexual theory of plants; whereas\r\na more careful study of history shows incontrovertibly that Linnaeus\r\nhelped in this way to disseminate the doctrine, but did absolutely\r\nnothing to establish it.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Linnaeus which we have hitherto examined are occupied\r\nwith the nature of plants, and of this he knew nothing more than he\r\ngathered from the investigations and reflections of his predecessors;\r\nand it is here especially that his peculiar scholasticism is exhibited\r\nin contrast with the facts obtained by induction which he communicated\r\nto his readers. But the strong side of his intellect appears with\r\nsplendid effect in the succeeding chapters of the ‘Philosophia,’ which\r\ntreat of the principles of systematic botany; here, where he has\r\nno longer to establish facts, but to arrange ideas, to dispose and\r\nsummarise, we find Linnaeus thoroughly in his element.\r\n\r\nThe groundwork of botanical science, he begins, is twofold,\r\nclassification and naming. The constituting of classes, orders, and\r\ngenera he calls theoretical classification; the constituting of species\r\nand varieties is practical classification. The work of classification\r\ncarried out by Cesalpino, Morison, Tournefort, and others leads to the\r\nestablishing of a system; the mere practice of describing species may\r\nbe carried on by those who know nothing of systematic botany. These\r\nexpressions of Linnaeus are interesting, because like other remarks of\r\nhis they show that he placed the establishment and arrangement of the\r\nlarger groups above the mere distinguishing of individual forms; his\r\ndisciples to a great extent forgot their master’s teaching, and fancied\r\nthat the collecting and distinguishing of species was systematic\r\nbotany. He opposes the system itself, which deals with the relative\r\nconceptions of classes, orders, genera, species, and varieties, to a\r\nmere synoptical view, serving with its dichotomy only to practical\r\nends. Then comes the often-quoted sentence, ‘We reckon so many species\r\nas there were distinct forms created “in principio.”’ In a former\r\nplace he had said ‘ab initio’ instead of ‘in principio’; instead\r\ntherefore of a beginning in time he here posits an ideal, theoretical\r\nbeginning, which is more in accordance with his philosophical views.\r\nThat new species can arise is, he continues, disproved by continuous\r\ngeneration and propagation, and by daily observation, and by the\r\ncotyledons. It is hard to understand how the Linnaean school till far\r\ninto our own century could have remained firm in a doctrine resting\r\non such arguments as these. Linnaeus’ definition of varieties shows\r\nthat he understood by the word species fundamentally distinct forms;\r\nthere are, he says, as many varieties as there are different plants\r\ngrowing from the seed of the same species; and he adds that a variety\r\nowes its origin to an accidental cause, such as climate, soil, warmth,\r\nthe wind; but this is evidently mere arbitrary assumption. Judging by\r\nall he says, his view is that species differ in their inner nature,\r\nvarieties only in outward form. Here, where we find the dogma of the\r\nconstancy of species for the first time expressed in precise terms,—a\r\ndogma generally accepted till the appearance of the theory of descent,\r\nwe should be justified in demanding proof; but since dogmas as a rule\r\ndo not admit of proof, Linnaeus simply states his view[32], unless we\r\nare to take the sentence, ‘negat generatio continuata, propagatio,\r\nobservationes quotidianae, cotyledones,’ as proving the assertion that\r\nnew species never appear. We shall see further on to what surprising\r\nconclusions Linnaeus was himself led by his dogma, when he had to take\r\ninto account the relations of affinity in genera and larger groups. The\r\nspecies and the genus, he continues, are always the work of nature,\r\nthe variety is often that of cultivation; the class and the order\r\ndepend both on nature and on art, which must mean that the larger\r\ngroups of the vegetable kingdom have not the same objective reality as\r\nthe species and the genus, but rest partly on opinion. That Linnaeus\r\nestimated the labours of the systematists after Cesalpino and the\r\ncontributions of the German fathers of botany up to Bauhin, as they\r\nhave been judged of in the present work, is shown by paragraph 163,\r\nwhere he explains the word habit, and adds that Kaspar Bauhin and the\r\nolder writers had excellently divined (divinarunt) the affinities of\r\nplants from their habit, and even real systematists had often erred,\r\nwhere the habit pointed out to them the right way. But he says that the\r\nnatural arrangement, which is the ultimate aim of botany, is founded,\r\nas the moderns have discovered, on the fructification, though even\r\nthis will not determine all the classes. It is interesting therefore\r\nto observe how Linnaeus further on (paragraph 168) directs, that in\r\nforming genera, though they must rest on the fructification, yet it is\r\nneedful to attend to the habit also, lest an incorrect genus should\r\nbe established on some insignificant mark (levi de causâ): but this\r\nattention to the habit must be managed with reserve, so as not to\r\ndisturb the scientific diagnosis.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus next lays down with great detail each several rule, which\r\nmust be observed in establishing species, genera, orders, and\r\nclasses, and it is here that he displays his unrivalled skill as a\r\nsystematist. These rules were strictly observed by himself in his\r\nnumerous descriptive works, and thus a spirit of order and clearness\r\nwas introduced into the art of describing plants, which gave it at once\r\na different appearance from that which it had received at the hands of\r\nhis predecessors. Whoever therefore compares the ‘Genera Plantarum,’\r\nthe ‘Systema Naturae,’ and other descriptive works of Linnaeus with\r\nthose of Morison, Ray, Bachmann, or Tournefort, finds so great a\r\nrevolution effected by them, that he is impressed with the persuasion\r\nthat botany first became a science in the hands of Linnaeus; all\r\nformer efforts seem to be so unskilful and without order in comparison\r\nwith his method. Without doubt the greatest and most lasting service\r\nwhich Linnaeus rendered both to botany and to zoology lies in the\r\ncertainty and precision which he introduced into the art of describing.\r\nBut if a reformation was thus effected in botany, as Linnaeus\r\nhimself took pleasure in saying, it must not be overlooked that the\r\nknowledge of the nature of plants was rather hindered than advanced\r\nby him. Ray, Bachmann, and in part also Morison and Tournefort, had\r\nalready liberated themselves to a great extent from the influence of\r\nscholasticism, and they still give us the impression of having been\r\ngenuine investigators of nature; but Linnaeus fell back again into the\r\nscholastic modes of thought, and these were so intimately combined with\r\nhis brilliant performances in systematic botany, that his successors\r\nwere unable to separate the one from the other.\r\n\r\nThe feeling for order and perspicuity, which made Linnaeus a reformer\r\nof the art of describing, combined with his scholasticism, was\r\nevidently the cause of his not bestowing more energetic labour on\r\nthe natural system. It has been repeatedly mentioned that it was\r\nhe who first established sixty-five truly natural groups in his\r\nfragment of the early date of 1738; and a certain feeling for natural\r\naffinity is shown in the establishment of his seven families, Fungi,\r\nAlgae, Mosses, Ferns, Grasses, Palms, and Plants properly so-called.\r\nMoreover in paragraph 163 of the ‘Philosophia Botanica,’ he carries\r\nout the division of the whole vegetable kingdom into Acotyledons,\r\nMonocotyledons, and Polycotyledons with their subdivisions very\r\nadmirably; and thus we see him continually impelled towards a natural\r\narrangement, but never bestowing upon it the necessary labour and\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nAnd so two different conceptions of a system of plants continued to\r\nsubsist side by side with each other in the mind of Linnaeus; one more\r\nsuperficial, and adapted for practical use, expressed in his artificial\r\nsexual system, and one more profound and scientifically valuable,\r\nembodied in his fragment and in the natural groups above-mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said also of Linnaeus’ morphological views; here,\r\ntoo, a more superficial pursued its way along with a more profound\r\nconception. He formed his terminology of the parts of plants for\r\npractical use in describing them, and convenient as it is, it seems\r\nnevertheless shallow or superficial, because its foundations are not\r\nmore deeply laid in the comparative study of forms. But we discover\r\nfrom very various passages in his writings that he felt the need of\r\na more profound conception of plant-form, and what he was able to\r\nsay on the subject he put together under the head of ‘metamorphosis\r\nplantarum.’ His doctrine of metamorphosis is entirely based on the\r\nviews of Cesalpino, with which we have already become acquainted,\r\nthough he did not adopt them in their original form, but endeavoured\r\nto develop them in true Cesalpinian fashion; for on the one hand he\r\nderived leaves and parts of flowers from the tissues of the stem, and\r\non the other conceived of the parts of the flower as only altered\r\nleaves. This doctrine of metamorphosis appears in somewhat confused\r\nform in the last page of his ‘Philosophia Botanica.’ There he says that\r\nthe whole of the herb is a continuation of the medullary substance of\r\nthe root; the principle of the flowers and leaves is the same, because\r\nboth spring from the tissue-layers surrounding the pith, as Cesalpino\r\nhad taught. The statement which follows, that the principle of the bud\r\nand the leaves is identical, would be a departure from Cesalpino, and\r\nin any case inconsistent, without the explanation that the bud consists\r\nof rudimentary leaves; but this again puts the axial portion of the bud\r\nout of sight. The perianth, he says, comes from concrescent rudiments\r\nof leaves. How closely Linnaeus adhered to Cesalpino in his later years\r\nappears in his explanation of the catkin, which comes next and which\r\nis taken entirely from Cesalpino’s theory. That a more superficial and\r\na more profound conception pursue their way together unadjusted in\r\nLinnaeus’ speculations on form is specially shown by the fact, that in\r\nthe text of the ‘Philosophia Botanica,’ paragraph 84, he places the\r\n‘stipulae’ under the idea of ‘fulcra’ and not under that of ‘folia,’\r\nwhile on the contrary at the end of the same work, where he brings\r\ntogether the different paragraphs respecting metamorphosis, he speaks\r\nof the ‘stipulae’ as appendages of the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe idea of Cesalpino, that the parts of the flower which surround the\r\nfruit arise like the ordinary leaves from the tissues that enclose\r\nthe pith, is further developed by Linnaeus in his ‘Metamorphosis\r\nPlantarum,’ in the fourth volume of the ‘Amoenitates Academicae’\r\n(1759), in a very strange manner. He compares the formation of the\r\nflower with the metamorphosis of animals, and especially of insects,\r\nand after describing the changes that take place in animals, he says at\r\npage 370 that plants are subject to similar change. The metamorphosis\r\nof insects consists in the putting off different skins, so that\r\nthey finally come forth naked in their true and perfect form. This\r\nmetamorphosis we also find in most plants, for they consist, at least\r\nin the truly living part of the root, of rind, bast, wood, and pith.\r\nThe rind is to the plant what the skin is to the larva of an insect,\r\nand after putting this skin off there remains a naked insect. When\r\nthe flower is produced in the plant the rind opens and forms the calyx\r\n(exactly Cesalpino’s view), and from out of this the inner parts of the\r\nplant issue to form the flower, so that the bast, the wood, and the\r\npith issue forth naked in the form of corolla, stamens, and stigma. So\r\nlong as the plant lies concealed within the rind and clothed only with\r\nleaves, it appears to us as unrecognisable and obscure as a butterfly,\r\nwhich in its larva-condition is covered with skin and spines.\r\n\r\nIn this doctrine of metamorphosis, which Linnaeus founded on Cesalpino,\r\nthe chief point to observe is, that the ordinary leaves are identical\r\nwith the exterior parts of the flower, because both originate in the\r\nouter tissues of the stem. The pertinent fact, which may easily be\r\nobserved without a microscope, that the concentric arrangement of\r\nouter and inner rind, wood, and pith occurs only in some flowering\r\nplants, that the case is quite different with Monocotyledons, and\r\nthat Cesalpino’s theory of the flower cannot properly be applied to\r\nthem,—these are things which we must not expect to find Linnaeus with\r\nhis peculiar modes of thought taking into consideration.\r\n\r\nThe want of firm standing-ground in experience is shown also by the\r\nfact, that with his own and Cesalpino’s theory of the flower he\r\ncombined another view of its nature, which under the name of ‘prolepsis\r\nplantarum’ was set forth in two dissertations in 1760 and 1763, but\r\nthe two theories are scarcely compatible with one another. While the\r\nlast paragraph in the ‘Philosophia Botanica’ says, ‘Flos ex gemmâ\r\nannuo spatio foliis praecocior est,’ the dissertations contain the\r\ndoctrine[33], that the flower is nothing but the synchronous appearance\r\nof leaves, which properly belong to the bud-formations of six\r\nconsecutive years, in such a way that the leaves of the bud destined to\r\nbe unfolded in the second year of the plants become bracts, the leaves\r\nof the third year the calyx, those of the fourth the corolla, those of\r\nthe fifth the stamens, those of the sixth the pistil. Here we see once\r\nmore how Linnaeus moves in the sphere of arbitrary assumptions with no\r\nthought of exact observation, for this whole theory of prolepsis rests\r\non nothing that can be called a well-ascertained fact.\r\n\r\nYet a third time we find in Linnaeus the juxtaposition of a superficial\r\nview resting on every-day perception, and a more profound and to some\r\nextent a philosophical view; this is the case where he is concerned on\r\nthe one hand with the dogma of the constancy of species, and on the\r\nother hand has to explain the fact of natural relationship and its\r\ngradations. Apart from some insignificant verbal explanations, Linnaeus\r\nadduced nothing in support of the dogma but the every-day perception of\r\nthe unchangeableness of species, and to this he held fast to the end\r\nof his life; but it was important to find an explanation of the fact,\r\nto which he himself repeatedly drew attention, that genera, orders,\r\nand classes do not merely rest on opinion but indicate really existing\r\naffinities. His mode of solving the difficulty was a very remarkable\r\none; not only does the scholastic manner of thought appear here again\r\nquite unalloyed by modern science, but he grounds his explanation once\r\nmore on the old _a priori_ notion that the pith is the vital principle\r\nin the plant, and also on his own assumption, that in the sexual act\r\nthe woody substance of the anthers combines with the pith-substance of\r\nthe pistil. Hugo Mohl has given a clear account of the matter in No. 46\r\nof the ‘Botanische Zeitung’ for 1870, although neither he nor Wigand\r\nnor most of Linnaeus’ biographers seem to know, that his theories are\r\nall to be traced to Cesalpino. Linnaeus’ theory of natural affinities,\r\nas he gave it in 1762 in the ‘Fundamentum Fructificationis,’ and in\r\n1764 in the sixth edition of the ‘Genera Plantarum,’ is as follows: At\r\nthe creation of plants (in ipsa creatione) one species was made as the\r\nrepresentative of each natural order, and these plants so corresponding\r\nto the natural orders were distinct from one another in habit and\r\nfructification, that is, absolutely distinct. In the communication of\r\n1764 the following words occur:—\r\n\r\n1. Creator T.O. in primordio vestiit vegetabile medullare principiis\r\nconstitutivis diversi corticalis, unde tot difformia individua, quot\r\nordines naturales, prognata.\r\n\r\n2. Classicas has plantas Omnipotens miscuit inter se, unde tot genera\r\nordinum, quot inde plantae.\r\n\r\n3. Genericas has miscuit natura, unde tot species congeneres, quot\r\nhodie existunt.\r\n\r\n4. Species has miscuit casus, unde totidem quot passim occurrunt\r\nvarietates.\r\n\r\nHugo Mohl was right in rejecting Heufler’s assumption that a view\r\nresembling the modern theory of descent was contained in these\r\nparagraphs. It must be plain to any one who knows the ideas of\r\nAristotle, Theophrastus, and Cesalpino, within the sphere of which\r\nLinnaeus is here moving, what he understands by his ‘vegetabile\r\nmedullare’ and ‘corticale’; that he does not for a moment mean a plant\r\nof simplest organisation, but that both expressions indicate only\r\nthe original elements of vegetation which the Creator, according to\r\nLinnaeus, united to one another at the first. He assumed that plants of\r\nthe highest and of the lowest grades of organisation were originally\r\ncreated at the same time and alongside of one another; no new\r\nclass-plants were afterwards created, but from the mingling together\r\nof the existing ones by the act of the Creator generically distinct\r\nforms were produced, and the natural mingling of these gave birth to\r\nspecies, while varieties were mere chance deviations from species. But\r\nit is to be noticed that in these minglings or hybridisations the woody\r\nsubstance of the one form which supplies the pollen is united with the\r\npith-substance of the other form, whose pistil is thus fertilised; and\r\nso in these supposed crossings it is always the two original elements\r\nof the plant, the medullary and the cortical, which are mingled\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nNo further proof is wanting that this theory of Linnaeus is no\r\nprecursor of our theory of descent, but is most distinctly opposed to\r\nit; it is utterly and entirely the fruit of scholasticism, while the\r\nessential feature in Darwin’s theory of descent is that scholasticism\r\nfinds no place in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATURAL SYSTEM UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DOGMA OF\r\n                       THE CONSTANCY OF SPECIES.\r\n\r\n                              1759-1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1750 Linnaeus’ terminology of the organs of plants\r\nand his binary method of naming species came into general use; the\r\nopposition which his doctrines had till then encountered by degrees\r\ndied away, and if all that he taught was not universally accepted,\r\nhis treatment of the art of describing plants soon became the common\r\nproperty of all botanists.\r\n\r\nBut in course of time two very different tendencies were developed;\r\nmost of the German, English, and Swedish botanists adhered strictly to\r\nLinnaeus’ dictum, that the merit of a botanist was to be judged by the\r\nnumber of species with which he was acquainted; they accepted Linnaeus’\r\nsexual system as one that completed the science in every respect; they\r\nthought that botany had reached its culminating point in Linnaeus, and\r\nthat any improvement or addition could only be made in details, by\r\ncontinuing to smooth over some unevennesses in the system, to collect\r\nnew species and describe them. The inevitable result was that botany\r\nceased to be a science; even the describing of plants which Linnaeus\r\nhad raised to an art became once more loose and negligent in the hands\r\nof such successors; in place of the morphological examination of the\r\nparts of plants there was an endless accumulating of technical terms\r\ndevoid of depth of scientific meaning, till at length a text-book of\r\nbotany came to look more like a Latin dictionary than a scientific\r\ntreatise. In proof of this we may appeal to Bernhardi’s ‘Handbuch\r\nder Botanik,’ published at Erfurt in 1804, and Bernhardi was one of\r\nthe best representatives of German botany of the time. How botany,\r\nespecially in Germany, gradually degenerated under the influence of\r\nLinnaeus’ authority into an easy-going insipid dilettantism may very\r\nwell be seen from the botanical periodical, entitled ‘Flora,’ the first\r\nvolumes of which cover the greater part of the first fifty years of the\r\n19th century; it is scarcely conceivable how men of some cultivation\r\ncould occupy themselves with such worthless matter. It would be quite\r\nlost labour to give any detailed account of this kind of scientific\r\nlife, if it can be so called, this dull occupation of plant-collectors,\r\nwho called themselves systematists, in entire contravention of the\r\nmeaning of the word. It is true indeed that these adherents of Linnaeus\r\ndid some service to botany by searching the floras of Europe and of\r\nother quarters of the globe, but they left it to others to turn to\r\nscientific account the material which they collected.\r\n\r\nBut before this evil had spread very widely, a new direction to the\r\nstudy of systematic botany and morphology was given in France, where\r\nthe sexual system had never met with great acceptance. Bernard de\r\nJussieu and his nephew, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, taking up Linnaeus’\r\nprofounder and properly scientific efforts, made the working out of the\r\nnatural system, in Linnaeus’ own opinion the highest aim of botany, the\r\ntask of their lives. Here more was needed than a perpetual repetition\r\nof descriptions of single plants after a fixed pattern; more exact\r\ninquiries into the organisation of plants, and especially of the parts\r\nof the fructification, must supply the foundation of larger natural\r\ngroups. It was a question therefore of new inductive investigation,\r\nof real physical science, of penetrating into the secrets of organic\r\nform, whereas the botanists who confined themselves to Linnaeus’ art of\r\ndescription made no new discoveries respecting the nature of plants.\r\nAnd if these men held to the dictum just quoted from Linnaeus, and\r\ntherefore regarded themselves as his genuine disciples, the founders\r\nof the natural system had as good a right to the title, not because\r\nthey followed his nomenclature and method of diagnosis, but because\r\nthey strove after exactly that object which he had placed first in the\r\nscience, the construction of the natural system; they were really the\r\nmen whom he had meant when he spoke of ‘methodici’ and ‘systematici.’\r\nThe German, English, and Swedish collectors of plants adhered to the\r\nless profound, every-day, practical precepts of their master; the\r\nfounders of the natural system followed the deeper traces of his\r\nknowledge. This direction proved to be the only one endowed with living\r\npower, the true possessor of the future.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of Jussieu, Joseph Gärtner, De Candolle, Robert Brown, and\r\ntheir successors up to Endlicher and Lindley, are not marked only by\r\nthe fact that they did truly seek to exhibit the gradations of natural\r\naffinities by means of the natural system; equally characteristic\r\nof these men is their firm belief in the dogma of the constancy of\r\nspecies as defined by Linnaeus. Here at once was a hindrance to their\r\nefforts; the idea of natural relationship, on which the natural system\r\nexclusively rests, necessarily remained a mystery to all who believed\r\nin the constancy of species; no scientific meaning could be connected\r\nwith this mysterious conception; and yet the farther the inquiry\r\ninto affinities proceeded, the more clearly were all the relations\r\nbrought out, which connect together species, genera, and families.\r\nPyrame de Candolle developed with great clearness a long series of\r\nsuch affinities as revealed to us by comparative morphology, but how\r\nwere these to be understood, so long as the dogma of the constancy\r\nof species severed every real objective connection between two\r\nrelated organisms? Little indeed could be made of these acknowledged\r\naffinities; still, in order to be able to speak of them and describe\r\nthem, recourse was had to indefinite expressions, to which arbitrary\r\nand figurative meanings could be assigned. Where Linnaeus had spoken\r\nof a class-plant or generic plant, the expression ‘plan of symmetry’ or\r\n‘type’ was used, meaning an ideal original form, from which numerous\r\nrelated forms might be derived. It was left undecided, whether this\r\nideal form ever really existed, or whether it was merely the result\r\nof intellectual abstraction; and thus the forms of thought of the\r\nold philosophy soon began to reappear. The Platonic ideas, though\r\nmere abstractions and therefore only products of the understanding,\r\nhad been regarded not only by the school of Plato, but also by the\r\nso-called Realists among the schoolmen, as really existing things. The\r\nsystematists obtained the idea of a type by abstraction, and the next\r\nstep was easy, to ascribe with the Platonists an objective existence to\r\nthis creature of thought, and to conceive of the type in the sense of a\r\nPlatonic idea. This was the only view that was possible in combination\r\nwith the dogma of the constancy of species, and so Elias Fries, in\r\nhis ‘Corpus Florarum,’ 1835, in speaking of the natural system, could\r\nconsistently say, ‘est quoddam supranaturale,’ and maintain that each\r\ndivision of it ‘ideam quandam exponit.’ So long as the constancy of\r\nspecies is maintained, there is no escaping from the conclusion drawn\r\nby Fries, but it is equally certain that systematic botany at the\r\nsame time ceases to be a scientific account of nature. Systematists,\r\nadopting this conclusion as necessarily following from the dogma,\r\nmight consider themselves as seeking to express in the natural system\r\nthe plan of creation, the thought of the Creator himself; but in this\r\nway systematic botany became mixed up with theological notions, and\r\nit is easy to understand why the first feeble attempts at a theory of\r\ndescent encountered such obstinate, nay, fanatical opposition from\r\nprofessed systematists, who looked upon the system as something above\r\nnature, a component part of their religion. And if we look back we find\r\nthat these views are based on the dogma of the constancy of species,\r\nwhile Linnaeus’ ‘Philosophia Botanica’ teaches us on what grounds this\r\ndogma rests, where it says, ‘Novas species dari in vegetabilibus\r\nnegat generatio continuata, propagatio, observationes quotidianae,\r\ncotyledones.’\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this one important advance was made by the successors\r\nof Jussieu; the larger groups of genera, the families, were defined\r\nwith the certainty and precision, with which Linnaeus had fixed the\r\nboundaries of species and genera, and were supplied with characteristic\r\nmarks. They succeeded also in clearly distinguishing various still\r\nlarger groups founded on natural affinity, such as the Monocotyledons\r\nand Dicotyledons; the distinction between Cryptogams and Phanerogams\r\nwas by degrees better appreciated, though this point could not be\r\nfinally settled, so long as it was attempted to reduce the Cryptogams\r\nentirely to the scheme of the Phanerogams. The chief hindrance however\r\nto the advance of systematic botany, at least at the beginning of\r\nthis period, lay in the defective morphology enshrined in Linnaeus’\r\nterminology and in his doctrine of metamorphosis. A great improvement\r\ncertainly was effected in the early part of the 19th century by De\r\nCandolle’s doctrine of the symmetry of plants,—a doctrine which has\r\nbeen much undervalued, and that merely on account of its name; it is\r\nreally a comparative morphology, and the first serious attempt of the\r\nkind since the time of Jung that has produced any great results; a\r\nseries of the most important morphological truths, with which every\r\nbotanist is now conversant, were taught for the first time in De\r\nCandolle’s doctrine of symmetry in 1813. But one thing was wanting\r\nnot only in Jussieu and De Candolle, but in all the systematists of\r\nthis period, with the single exception of Robert Brown, and this\r\nwas the history of development. The history of the morphology and\r\nsystematic botany of this period shows indeed, that the comparison of\r\nmature forms leads to the recognition of many and highly important\r\nmorphological facts; but as long as matured organisms only are\r\ncompared, the morphological consideration of them is always disturbed\r\nby the circumstance that the organs to be compared are already adapted\r\nto definite physiological functions, and thus their true morphological\r\ncharacter is often entirely obscured; on the other hand, the younger\r\nthe organs are, the less is this difficulty experienced, and this is\r\nthe real reason why the history of development is of so great service\r\nto morphology. It was then one of the characteristic features of the\r\nperiod we are describing, that its morphology was formed upon the study\r\nof matured forms; the history of development, or at all events of very\r\nearly stages of development, could not be turned to account till after\r\n1840, for skill in the use of the microscope, here indispensable, was\r\nnot sufficiently advanced before that time to make it possible to\r\nfollow the growth of organs from their first beginnings.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of natural affinities combined with the assumption of\r\nthe constancy of species, the growth of comparative morphology without\r\nthe history of development, lastly, the very subordinate attention\r\nstill paid to the Cryptogams,—these are the special characteristics of\r\nthe period which has now to be described at greater length.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere we must once more call attention to the fact, that Linnaeus was\r\nthe first to perceive that a system which was to be the expression\r\nof natural affinities could not be attained in the way pursued by\r\nCesalpino and his immediate successors. All who have attentively\r\nstudied the writings of Linnaeus which appeared after the ‘Classes\r\nPlantarum’ (1738) must have seen the difference between that way and\r\nthe one recommended by him—a difference which is the more obvious\r\nbecause Linnaeus himself, like his predecessors, constructed an\r\nartificial system on predetermined principles of classification, and\r\nalways employed it for practical purposes, while he published at the\r\nsame time in the above-named work his fragment of a natural system,\r\nand in the preface set forth the peculiar features of the natural and\r\nartificial systems in striking contrast with one another. The first\r\nthing and the last, he says in his prefatory remarks to his fragment,\r\nwhich is demanded in systematic botany, is the natural method, which\r\nslighted by less learned botanists has always been highly regarded by\r\nthe more sagacious, and has not yet been discovered. If, he continues,\r\nwe collect the natural orders from all existing systems (up to 1738),\r\nwe shall get but a small list of really allied plants, though so many\r\nsystems have claimed to be natural. He had himself long laboured\r\nto discover the natural method and had found out some things that\r\nwere new; but though he had not succeeded in carrying it through to\r\na perfect work, he would continue his efforts as long as his life\r\nlasted. He makes the very important remark, that a key, that is, _a\r\npriori_ principles of classification, cannot be given for the natural\r\nmethod, till all plants have been reduced to orders; that for this\r\nno _a priori_ rule is of value, neither this nor that part of the\r\nfructification, but the simple symmetry alone (simplex symmetria) of\r\nall the parts, which is often indicated by special marks. He suggests\r\nto those who are bent on trying to find a key to the natural system,\r\nthat nothing has more general value than relative position, especially\r\nin the seed, and in the seed especially the ‘punctum vegetans,’—a\r\ndistinct reference to Cesalpino. He says that he establishes no classes\r\nhimself, but only orders; if these are once obtained, it will be easy\r\nto discover the classes. The essence of the natural system could not\r\nhave been more clearly expounded in Linnaeus’ time, than it is in\r\nthese sentences. He established as early as 1738 sixty-five natural\r\norders, which he at first simply numbered; but in the first edition\r\nof the ‘Philosophia Botanica’ in 1751, where the list is increased to\r\nsixty-seven, he gave a special name to each group; and he showed his\r\njudgment by either taking his names from really characteristic marks,\r\nor what was still better, by selecting a genus and so modifying its\r\nname as to make it serve as a general term for a whole group. Many of\r\nthese designations are still in use, though the extent and content\r\nof the groups have been greatly changed. This mode of naming is an\r\nimportant point, because it expresses the idea, that the different\r\ngenera of such a group are to some extent regarded as forms derived\r\nfrom the one selected to supply the name. Many of Linnaeus’ orders\r\ndo in fact indicate cycles of natural affinity, though single genera\r\nare not unfrequently found to occupy a false position; at all events,\r\nLinnaeus’ fragment is much the most natural system proposed up to 1738,\r\nor even to 1751. It is distinguished from Kaspar Bauhin’s enumeration\r\nin this, that its groups do not run into one another, but are defined\r\nby strict boundaries and fixed by names.\r\n\r\nThe Linnaean list is distinctly marked by the endeavour to make first\r\nthe Monocotyledons, then the Dicotyledons, and finally the Cryptogams\r\nfollow one another; that the old division into trees and herbs already\r\nrejected by Jung and Bachmann, but still maintained by Tournefort and\r\nRay, disappears in Linnaeus’ natural system will be taken for granted\r\nafter what has been already said of it, and from this time forward this\r\nancient mistake is banished for ever.\r\n\r\nIn BERNARD DE JUSSIEU’S[34] arrangement of 1759 we find some\r\nimprovements in the naming, the grouping, and the succession, but at\r\nthe same time some striking offences against natural affinity. He\r\npublished no theoretical remarks on the system, but gave expression\r\nto his views on relations of affinity in the vegetable kingdom in\r\nlaying out the plants in the royal garden of Trianon, and in the\r\ngarden-catalogue. His nephew published his uncle’s enumeration in the\r\nyear 1789 in his ‘Genera Plantarum,’ affixing the date of 1759 given\r\nabove. The difference between it and the Linnaean fragment does not\r\nseem sufficiently marked to make it necessary to reproduce it here.\r\nIt should be noticed however that Jussieu begins with the Cryptogams,\r\npasses through the Monocotyledons to the Dicotyledons, and ends with\r\nthe Conifers. Adanson’s claims of priority over Bernard de Jussieu\r\n(see the ‘Histoire de la Botanique’ de Michel Adanson, Paris, 1864,\r\np. 36) may be passed over as unimportant. The natural system was not\r\nadvanced by Adanson to any noticeable extent; how little he saw into\r\nits real nature and into the true method of research in this department\r\nof botany is sufficiently shown by the fact, that he framed no less\r\nthan sixty-five different artificial systems founded on single marks,\r\nsupposing that natural affinities would come out of themselves as\r\nan ultimate product,—an effort all the more superfluous, because a\r\nconsideration of the systems proposed since Cesalpino’s time would have\r\nbeen enough to show the uselessness of such a proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe first great advance in the natural system is due to ANTOINE LAURENT\r\nDE JUSSIEU[35] (1748-1836). After all that has been said no further\r\nproof is needed that he was no more the discoverer or founder of the\r\nnatural system than his uncle before him. His real merit consists in\r\nthis, that he was the first who assigned characters to the smaller\r\ngroups, which we should now call families, but which he called orders.\r\nIt is not uninteresting to note here how Bauhin first provided the\r\nspecies with characters, and named the genera but did not characterise\r\nthem, how Tournefort next defined the limits of the genera, how\r\nLinnaeus grouped the genera together, and simply named these groups\r\nwithout assigning to them characteristic marks, and how finally Antoine\r\nLaurent de Jussieu supplied characters to the families which were now\r\nfairly recognised. Thus botanists learnt by degrees to abstract the\r\ncommon marks from like forms; the groups thus constituted were being\r\nconstantly enlarged, and an inductive process was thus completed which\r\nproceeded from the individual to the more general.\r\n\r\nIt might appear that the merit of Antoine de Jussieu is rated too low,\r\nwhen we praise him chiefly and simply for providing the families with\r\ncharacters; but this praise will not seem small to those who know the\r\ndifficulty of such a task; very careful and long-continued researches\r\nwere necessary to discover what marks are the common property of a\r\nnatural group. Jussieu’s numerous monographs show with what earnestness\r\nhe addressed himself to the task; and it must be added, that he was\r\nnot content simply to adopt the families established by Linnaeus and\r\nby his uncle and the limits which they had assigned to them, but\r\nthat he corrected their boundaries and in so doing established many\r\nnew families, and was the first who attempted to distribute these\r\ninto larger groups, which he named classes. But in this he was not\r\nsuccessful. His attempt to exhibit the whole vegetable kingdom in all\r\nits main divisions, to unite the classes themselves into higher groups,\r\nwas also unsuccessful, for these larger divisions remained evidently\r\nartificial. The three largest groups on the contrary, into which he\r\nfirst divides the world of plants, the Acotyledons, Monocotyledons, and\r\nDicotyledons are natural; but they had been already partly marked out\r\nby Ray, afterwards by Linnaeus, and finally in Bernard de Jussieu’s\r\nenumerations. Still it is the younger Jussieu’s great and abiding\r\nmerit, to have first attempted to substitute a real division of the\r\nwhole vegetable kingdom into larger and gradually subordinate groups\r\nfor mere enumerations of smaller co-ordinated groups,—an undertaking\r\nwhich Linnaeus expressly declared to be beyond his powers. If then\r\nJussieu’s system was far from giving a satisfactory insight into\r\nthe affinities of the great divisions of the vegetable kingdom, yet\r\nit opened out many important points of view, from which they could\r\nafterwards be discovered, and it certainly became the foundation for\r\nall further advance in the natural method of classification; for this\r\nreason it is necessary to give a view of it in the following table:—\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

At the same time the use of the word Acotyledones\r\nfor Linnaeus’ Cryptogams shows that Jussieu overrated the systematic\r\nvalue of the cotyledons, because, as is seen from the introduction\r\nto his ‘Genera Plantarum,’ he was quite in the dark on the subject\r\nof the great difference between the spores of Cryptogamic plants and\r\nthe seeds of Phanerogams. His conception of the organs of generation\r\nwas essentially that of Linnaeus; hence he judged of the Cryptogams\r\naccording to the scheme of the Phanerogams, and, not perceiving their\r\npeculiarities, he virtually characterised them by negative marks.\r\n\r\nIf we notice in the above table how the Phanerogams are separated\r\ninto classes, it strikes us that the triple division into hypogynous,\r\nperigynous, and epigynous is repeated no less than four times; this\r\nshows that Jussieu had mistaken ideas of the value of these marks for\r\nclassification, whereas the recurrence of them so often should of\r\nitself have suggested a doubt on this point. To judge of his system\r\nmore exactly we must here give his series of the families, which he had\r\nalready raised to the number of a hundred.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass I.\r\n\r\n  1. Fungi.\r\n  2.

The grouping of the Dicotyledons on the contrary is to a great\r\nextent unsuccessful, chiefly owing to the too great importance which\r\nhe attached to the insertion of the parts of the flowers, that is, to\r\nthe hypogynous, perigynous, and epigynous arrangement. It is in this\r\ngrouping of families into classes that the weak side of the system\r\nlies; it is utterly artificial, and the task of his successors has been\r\nto arrange the families of the Phanerogams, which were most of them\r\nwell-established, and especially those of the Dicotyledons, in larger\r\nnatural groups. But this could not be effected, till morphology opened\r\nnew points of view for systematic botany; Jussieu, as has been already\r\nremarked, accepted Linnaeus’ views of the morphology of the organs of\r\nfructification in Phanerogams, though he introduced many improvements\r\nin details. He laid greater stress on the number and relative positions\r\nof the different parts of the flower; attention to their insertion on\r\nthe flowering axis, which he designated as hypogynous, perigynous,\r\nand epigynous, would have been a great step in advance, if he had not\r\noverrated its systematic value. The morphology of the fruit is very\r\nsuperficial in Jussieu; even the designation of dry indehiscent fruits\r\nas naked seeds recurs in his definitions, though as it happens this\r\nmisconception does not cause any great disturbance. How inexact was his\r\ninvestigation of the organs of fructification, when they were somewhat\r\nsmall and obscure, is best shown by the fact that the Naiades, which\r\nare made to include Hippuris, Chara, and Callitriche, appear among the\r\nAcotyledons, and that Lemna and the Cycads are placed with the Ferns.\r\n\r\nJussieu explained the dictum, ‘Natura non facit saltus,’ to mean that\r\nthe whole body of plants in its natural arrangement must exhibit a\r\nlineal series ascending from the most imperfect to the highest forms;\r\nbut he does not say whether Linnaeus’ comparison of the natural system\r\nto a geographical map, the countries in which answer to orders and\r\nclasses, is also admissible.\r\n\r\nHis theoretical observations on the value to be given to certain marks\r\nin a systematic point of view are not attractive, and for the most\r\npart not very correct; he speaks as though some marks must have a\r\nmore extensive, others a less extensive value; the perception of the\r\nfact, so far as it is true, rests entirely upon induction; that is,\r\nafter the natural affinities have been already recognised to a certain\r\nextent, it becomes apparent that certain marks remain constant in\r\nlarger or smaller groups; the systematist can now go on to try whether\r\nsuch constant marks occur in other plants also, which he had hitherto\r\nassigned to other groups, and thus put it to the test whether those\r\nmarks may not be accompanied by others, which would serve to establish\r\nthe affinities; that Jussieu did so proceed in defining his families\r\nadmits of no doubt, but he was not himself thoroughly conscious of the\r\nfact; at all events, he did not extend this mode of proceeding, the\r\nseeking after leading marks, to the establishing of larger groups or\r\nclasses, for these he founded on predetermined principles.\r\n\r\nJussieu’s labours as a systematist were not confined to the publication\r\nof his ‘Genera Plantarum’; on the contrary, his most fruitful\r\nresearches began after 1802, and were continued to the year 1820, and\r\ntheir results appeared in a long series of monographs on different\r\nfamilies in the Mémoires du Museum. He felt with De Candolle, Robert\r\nBrown, and later systematists, that the perfecting of the natural\r\nsystem depended mainly on the careful establishing and defining of\r\nfamilies. His efforts received a new impulse from the work of a German\r\nwriter, whose first volume had appeared in 1788, a year therefore\r\nbefore the ‘Genera Plantarum,’ a second following it in 1791, and a\r\nsupplementary volume in 1805.\r\n\r\nThis work was JOSEPH GÄRTNER’S[36] ‘De fructibus et seminibus\r\nplantarum,’ in which the fruits and seeds of more than a thousand\r\nspecies are described and carefully figured. But almost more important\r\nthan these numerous descriptions, though they offered rich material\r\nto the professed systematists, were the introductions to the first\r\ntwo volumes, and especially to those of 1788. They contain valuable\r\nreflections on sexuality in plants,—a subject which had remained in\r\nthe condition in which it was left by Camerarius (1694) till it was\r\ngreatly developed by Koelreuter after 1761, and had since then been\r\nlittle studied,—and an account of the morphology of fruits and seeds,\r\nthe knowledge of which had gone back rather than advanced since the\r\ndays of Malpighi and Grew. Gärtner was well qualified for this work by\r\nhis unparalleled knowledge of the forms of fruits, and still more by\r\nthe character of his mind. Free from Linnaeus’ scholastic bias, he\r\naddressed himself to the examination of the most difficult organs of\r\nplants with as great freedom from prepossessions as exact acquaintance\r\nwith the writings of others; he gives us the impression of a modern man\r\nof science more than any other botanist of the 18th century, with the\r\nexception of Koelreuter. He knew how to communicate with clearness of\r\nlanguage and perspicuity of arrangement whatever he gathered of general\r\nimportance from each investigation. Though it is easy to see that the\r\nfounding of the natural system was ever before his mind as the final\r\nobject of his protracted labours, he was in no eager haste to reach it;\r\nhe contented himself with arranging his fruits, saying expressly that\r\nthe natural system would never be founded by these means alone, though\r\nthe exact knowledge of fruits and seeds supplied the most important\r\nmeans for decision. Thus his great work was at once an inexhaustible\r\nmine of single well-ascertained facts, and a guide to the morphology\r\nof the organs of fructification and to its application to systematic\r\nbotany. The imperfections, which are to be found even in this work,\r\nare due to the circumstances of the time; in spite of Schmeidel’s and\r\nHedwig’s researches into the Mosses there was still the old obscurity\r\nwith regard to the organs of propagation in the Cryptogams, and this\r\nrendered a right definition of the ideas, seed and fruit, extremely\r\ndifficult. But Gärtner made one great step in advance on this very\r\npoint when he showed that the spores of the Cryptogams were essentially\r\ndifferent from the seeds of Phanerogams, with which they had been\r\nhitherto compared, because they contain no embryo; he called them\r\ntherefore not seeds, but gemmae. The second great hindrance to a true\r\nconception of certain characters in fruits and seeds on the part of\r\nGärtner was the entire ignorance of the history of development which\r\nthen reigned; yet even here we see an advance, if only a small one,\r\nmade by him in his repeatedly going back to the young state for a more\r\ncorrect idea of the organs.\r\n\r\nAbove all, Gärtner put an end to the blunder of regarding dry\r\nindehiscent fruits as naked seeds, by rightly defining the pericarp\r\nas in all cases the ripened wall of the ovary, and by considering its\r\nstrong or weak construction, its dry or pulpy condition, as a secondary\r\nmatter. It is obvious that the whole theory of the flower was thus\r\nplaced upon a better basis, since dry indehiscent fruits may come from\r\ninferior or superior ovaries. But Gärtner’s theory of the seed is\r\none of his most valuable contributions to the science. After careful\r\nconsideration of the seed-envelopes, he submitted the inner portion\r\n(nucleus) enclosed by them to a searching comparative examination;\r\nhe correctly distinguished the endosperm from the cotyledons, and\r\ndescribed the variations in its form and position. This was the more\r\nneedful, since Linnaeus had denied the existence of an ‘albumen’ in\r\nplants, which Grew had already recognised and so named; to Linnaeus\r\nit appeared to be of no use to the seed. Though Gärtner speaks of the\r\ncotyledons as uniting with the embryo to form the nucleus of the seed,\r\nyet his account shows that he regarded them as outgrowths of the embryo\r\nitself. The uncertainty which still existed in the interpretation of\r\nthe parts of the seed is shown even in Gärtner by his curious notion of\r\na ‘vitellus,’ which in fact takes in everything that he was unable to\r\nexplain aright inside the seed; for instance, he makes the scutellum\r\nin grasses, and even the cotyledonary bodies of Zamia a vitellus, and\r\napplies the same name to the whole contents of the spores of Seaweeds,\r\nMosses, and Ferns. In spite of the striking defects connected with\r\nthis mistaken notion in his theory of the seed, his views far surpass\r\nin clearness and consistency all that had hitherto been taught on the\r\nsubject. His giving the term embryo to that part of the seed which is\r\ncapable of development was also an advance in respect of logic and\r\nmorphology, in spite of his mistake in not admitting the cotyledons\r\nwhich are attached to the embryo into the conception; this, however,\r\ncould easily be corrected at a later time. What Gärtner now named\r\nthe embryo, had been up to his time called the ‘corculum seminis,’\r\nespecially by Linnaeus and Jussieu; it was evidently thought that\r\nCesalpino’s phraseology was thus retained; but he, as we have seen,\r\nunderstood by the words ‘cor seminis’ the spot where the cotyledons\r\nspring from the germ, which spot he wrongly took for the meeting-point\r\nof root and stem and the seat of the soul of the plant. And so at last\r\nafter two hundred years the word disappeared from use, which might\r\nhave reminded the botanist of Cesalpino’s views respecting the soul of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nA work such as Gärtner’s could scarcely find a fruitful soil in\r\nGermany, where some thirty years before even Koelreuter’s brilliant\r\ninvestigations had met with little sympathy, and Conrad Sprengel’s\r\nremarkable enquiries into the relations of the structure of the flower\r\nto the insect-world in 1793 failed to be understood; Gärtner complains\r\nin the second part, published in 1791, that not two hundred copies of\r\nthe first volume were sold in three years. But the work, which forms an\r\nepoch in the history of botany, was better received in France, where\r\nthe Academy placed it as second in the list of the productions which\r\nin later times had been most profitable to science; there lived the\r\nman who was able to measure the whole value of such a work—Antoine\r\nLaurent de Jussieu. But even in Germany, where plant-describing was\r\ncomfortably flourishing, there were not altogether wanting men who\r\nknew how to estimate both the services of Gärtner and the importance\r\nof the natural system. First among these was August Johann Georg Karl\r\nBatsch, Professor in Jena from 1761 to 1802, who published in the\r\nlatter year a ‘Tabula affinitatum regni vegetabilis,’ with characters\r\nof the groups and families. Kurt Sprengel, who was born in 1766, and\r\ndied as Professor of Botany in Halle in 1833, contributed still more\r\nto the spread of clearer views respecting the real character of the\r\nnatural system and the task of scientific botany generally by numerous\r\nworks, and especially by his ‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ which appeared\r\nin 1817 and 1818. But even this highly gifted and accomplished man\r\nagreed with the Linnaean botanists in attributing an excessive value\r\nto the describing of plants, as is shown in his history, where to exalt\r\nthe merits of the old botanists he gives figures of the plants first\r\ndescribed by them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the meritorious efforts of these men were not in themselves\r\ncapable of directly advancing the natural system, or of greatly\r\nincreasing the number of its adherents in Germany, nor did it find\r\ngeneral acceptance in that country till it had made considerable\r\nprogress in the hands of the two foremost botanists of the time, De\r\nCandolle and Robert Brown.\r\n\r\nAUGUSTIN PYRAME DE CANDOLLE[37] (1778-1841) belongs to the number of\r\nthose distinguished investigators of nature, who at the end of the last\r\nand the beginning of our own century made their native city Geneva a\r\nbrilliant centre of natural science. De Candolle was the contemporary\r\nand fellow-countryman of Vaucher, Theodore de Saussure, and Senebier.\r\nPhysics and physiology especially were being successfully cultivated\r\nat that time in Geneva, and Pyrame de Candolle was attracted to these\r\nstudies; among his youthful efforts are some important investigations\r\ninto the effect of light on vegetation, and the contributions which he\r\nmade to vegetable physiology in his great work on that subject will\r\nbe noticed in a later portion of this history. De Candolle turned his\r\nattention to all parts of theoretical and applied botany, but his\r\nimportance for the history of the science lies chiefly in the direction\r\nof morphology and systematic botany, and it is this which we will now\r\nproceed to describe.\r\n\r\nThe amount and compass of De Candolle’s labours as a systematic and\r\ndescriptive botanist exceed those of any writer before or after him.\r\nHe wrote a series of comprehensive monographs of large families of\r\nplants, and published a new edition of De Lamarck’s large ‘Flore\r\nFrançaise’ substantially altered and enlarged; and in addition to these\r\nand many similar works and treatises on the geographical distribution\r\nof plants, he set on foot the grandest work of descriptive botany that\r\nis as yet in existence, the ‘Prodromus Systematis Naturalis,’ in which\r\nall known plants were to be arranged according to his natural system\r\nand described at length,—a work not yet fully completed, and in which\r\nmany other descriptive botanists of the last century participated, but\r\nnone to so large an extent as De Candolle, who alone completed more\r\nthan a hundred families. It is not possible to give an account in few\r\nwords of the service rendered to botany by such labours as these; they\r\nform the real empirical basis of general botany, and the better and\r\nmore carefully this is laid, the greater the security obtained for the\r\nfoundations of the whole science.\r\n\r\nBut a still higher merit perhaps can be claimed for De Candolle,\r\ninasmuch as he not only like Jussieu elaborated the system and its\r\nfundamental principles in his descriptive works, but developed the\r\ntheory, the laws of natural classification, with a clearness and\r\ndepth such as no one before him had displayed. To this purpose he\r\napplied morphological researches, which in profundity and wealth of\r\nthought and in the fruitfulness of their results for the whole domain\r\nof systematic botany far surpassed all that Linnaeus and Jussieu had\r\naccomplished, and show us that while engaged in his splendid labours\r\nin descriptive botany he had caught during his ten years’ residence\r\nin Paris the true spirit of modern investigation of nature, as it had\r\nbeen developed by the French naturalists of the end of the previous\r\ncentury. Scarcely a trace is to be found in De Candolle of the\r\nscholasticism of Cesalpino and Linnaeus, which occasionally makes its\r\nappearance even in Jussieu. For instance, he dealt with morphology as\r\nessentially the doctrine of the symmetry of form in plants, that is, he\r\nfound the basis of morphological examination in the relative position\r\nand numbers of the organs, disregarding their physico-physiological\r\nproperties as of no account from the morphological point of view. He\r\nwas therefore the first who recognised the remarkable discordance\r\nbetween the morphological characters of organs, which are of value\r\nfor systematic purposes, and their physiological adaptations to the\r\nconditions of life, though it must at the same time be acknowledged,\r\nthat he did not consistently carry out this principle, but committed\r\ngrave offences against it in laying down his own system. It is a point\r\nof the highest interest in De Candolle’s morphological speculations,\r\nthat he was the first who endeavoured to refer certain relations of\r\nnumber and form to definite causes, and thus to distinguish what is\r\nprimary and important in the symmetry of plants from merely secondary\r\nvariations, as is seen in his doctrine of the abortion and adherence\r\nof organs. In these distinctions De Candolle laid the foundation of\r\nmorphological views, which, though now modified to some extent, do\r\nstill contain the chief elements of morphology and the natural system;\r\nbut his morphological speculations were confined to the domain of\r\nthe Phanerogams, and chiefly advanced the theory of the flower; a\r\nmorphology of the Cryptogams was as little to be thought of in the\r\ncondition of microscopy before 1820, as the application of the history\r\nof development to the establishment of morphological theories.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle published his morphology or doctrine of symmetry and his\r\ntheory of classification together in a book which appeared first\r\nin 1813, with the title, ‘Théorie Élémentaire de la botanique ou\r\nexposition des principes de la classification naturelle et de l’art de\r\ndécrire et d’étudier les végétaux,’ and again in 1819 in an improved\r\nand enlarged edition. The second edition will be the one referred to in\r\nthe further account of his views. The second chapter of the second book\r\nconcerns us most at present. After alluding to the fact, that anatomy\r\nand physiology are concerned with the structure of the individual\r\norgan only so far as the power to fulfil its proper function depends\r\non the structure, he points out that the physiological point of view\r\nis no longer sufficient when we are engaged in comparing the organs of\r\ndifferent plants. Though it is true that the function of the organs\r\nis the most important for the life and permanence of the individual,\r\nyet we find these functions modified in the case of homologous organs\r\nin different plants; for the natural classification we must take into\r\nconsideration only the entire system of organisation, that is, the\r\nsymmetry of the organs. All organisms of a kingdom, he continues, have\r\nthe same functions with slight modifications; the immense amount of\r\nvariation in systematically different species depends therefore only\r\non the way in which the general symmetry of structure varies. This\r\nsymmetry of the parts, the discovery of which is the great object\r\nin the investigation of nature, is nothing more than the sum total\r\n(l’ensemble) of the positional relations of the parts. Whenever these\r\nrelations (disposition) are regulated according to the same plan,\r\nthe organisms exhibit a certain general resemblance to one another,\r\nindependently of the form of the organs in detail; when this general\r\nresemblance is perceived, without any attempt to give any account of\r\nit in the detail, we have what has been called habitual relationship;\r\nbut it is the task of the doctrine of symmetry to resolve this likeness\r\nof habit into its elements, and to explain its causes. Without this\r\nstudy of symmetry it may easily happen that two different kinds of\r\nsymmetry may be supposed to be alike, because they seem outwardly\r\nalike to our senses, just as forms of crystals of different systems\r\nmay be confounded together for want of careful examination; the chief\r\nthing is to know the plan of symmetry in every class of plants,\r\nand the study of this is the foundation of every theory of natural\r\naffinities. But success in this study depends on the certainty with\r\nwhich organs are distinguished, and the distinguishing them must be\r\nindependent of changes of form, size, and function. He then shows that\r\nthe difficulties in the morphological comparison of organs, or, as we\r\nshould now say, in the establishing the homology, are due to three\r\ncauses; abortion, degeneration, and adherence (adhérence). These three\r\ncauses, by which the original symmetry of a class is changed and may\r\neven be utterly obscured, are then fully illustrated by examples.\r\n\r\nIn respect to abortion he distinguishes that which is produced by\r\ninternal causes from that which is due to accidental and external ones;\r\nhe refers especially to the abortion of two loculaments in the fruit of\r\nthe horse-chestnut and the oak, to the suppression of the terminal bud\r\nin some shrubs by the adjoining axillary buds, and to the fact that all\r\norgans of plants may become abortive in a similar manner; for instance,\r\nthe sexual organs disappear entirely in the disk-flowers of Viburnum\r\nOpulus, and one of the two sexes in the flower of Lychnis dioica. He\r\ngoes on to answer the question, how it is possible to discover the\r\nsymmetry in such cases; one method he finds supplied by monstrosities,\r\namong which there are even some that may be regarded as a return to the\r\noriginal symmetry, the cases known as peloria. Analogy or ‘induction’\r\nis, he says, less certain, but of much more extensive application;\r\nthis is founded exclusively on the knowledge of the relative position\r\nof organs. Armed with this, we find that the flower of Albuca, which\r\ncorresponds to a flower of Liliaceae in everything except in having\r\nonly three stamens, is to be considered one of the Liliaceae, because\r\nit has three filaments placed between the three stamens exactly in\r\nthe position of the three other stamens in the Liliaceae; it must\r\nbe concluded therefore that they are abortive stamens. Similar\r\nconclusions from analogy must be carried from species to species,\r\nfrom organ to organ, and the great systematists have in fact done so.\r\nIn certain cases abortion is produced by defect, in others by excess\r\nof nourishment, of which he gives examples. An important sentence\r\noccurs in this place; everything in nature, he says, leads us to\r\nbelieve that all organisms in their inner nature are regular, and that\r\ndifferent forms of abortion differently combined are the cause of all\r\nirregularity; from this point of view the smallest irregularities\r\nare important, because they lead us to expect greater ones in nearly\r\nallied plants; and wherever in a given system of organisation there\r\nare inequalities between organs of the same name, the inequality will\r\npossibly reach a maximum, that is, end by annihilating the smallest\r\npart. Thus in the Labiatae with two stamens, it is the two which in\r\nother cases also are the smaller, which are here completely aborted.\r\nWhen in Crassulaceae there are twice as many stamens as petals, those\r\nthat alternate with the petals are larger and earlier developed, and\r\nwe may therefore expect that those which are opposite the petals may\r\nbecome abortive; and therefore we may place a genus like Sedum, in\r\nwhich the latter are sometimes wanting, with Crassulaceae; but we could\r\nnot do so, if we found only the stamens that are superposed upon the\r\npetals. It occurs sometimes, he continues, that an organ is prevented\r\nfrom fulfilling its function by partial abortion. In this case it may\r\nassume another function, as the abortive leaves of the vetch and the\r\nabortive inflorescences of the vine are employed as tendrils. In other\r\ncases the abortive organ appears to be quite useless, as for instance\r\nmany rudimentary leaves. All such useless organs, says De Candolle,\r\nexist only in consequence of the primitive symmetry of all organs.\r\nFinally the abortion may be so complete that no trace of the organ\r\nremains, of which case there are however two kinds, one where the organ\r\nis at first perceptible and afterwards quite disappears, as in the\r\nabortive loculaments in the fruit of the oak; in other instances no\r\ntrace is to be seen from the first of the abortive organs, as happens\r\nwith the fifth stamen of Antirrhinum.\r\n\r\nAll that has here been said might be alleged word for word in proof\r\nof the theory of descent, but our author is an adherent of the dogma\r\nof the constancy of species; what from his point of view he really\r\nmeans by abortion is difficult to say, for the object which is aborted\r\nis wanting. If species are constant, and therefore of absolutely\r\ndistinct origin, we must not speak of abortion; we can only say\r\nthat an organ which is present or large in one species is small or\r\nwanting in another. In introducing the idea of abortion De Candolle\r\nat once goes beyond the dogma of the constancy of species, without\r\nbeing clear in his own mind with regard to this important step.\r\nHis proceeding shows that facts lead even a defender of constancy\r\nagainst his will to theories which run counter to that dogma. This\r\nis confirmed by his perception of the correlation of growth, which\r\nis connected with abortion; he points to the fact that owing to the\r\ndisappearance of sexual organs in the disk-flowers of Viburnum Opulus\r\nthe corollas become larger, as do the bracts of the abortive flowers\r\nof Salvia Horminum; similarly he regards the disappearance of the\r\nseeds in Ananas, Banana, and the Bread-fruit tree as the cause of the\r\nenlargement of the pericarps; it does not escape him, that the fertile\r\nflower-stalks in Rhus Cotinus remain naked, while an elegant pubescence\r\nforms on the barren ones; the leaf-like expansion of the leaf-stalks\r\nof Acacia heterophylla, which do not develop their laminae, he refers\r\nalso to this correlation of growth. He finds the most remarkable\r\nexample of the kind in the doubling of flowers, where according to his\r\nview the disappearance of the anthers is a condition of the corolline\r\nexpansion of the filaments; in the same way sometimes the carpel is\r\nchanged into a petal through the disappearance of the stigma. Though in\r\nmany of these cases it is quite possible to conceive of the relations\r\nof cause and effect in the reverse way, yet De Candolle’s principle of\r\ncorrelation will be equally applicable.\r\n\r\nThe second cause by which the symmetry may be obliterated, namely\r\ndegeneration, asserts itself in the formation of thorns, of threadlike\r\nprolongations of membranous expansions, and in the production of fleshy\r\nparts, or of parts with dry membranes.\r\n\r\nThe third kind of departure from the symmetrical plan is the adherence\r\nof parts, the theory of which he grounds first and chiefly on the\r\nphenomena of grafting, and then passes to more difficult cases. The\r\nclose packing of the ovaries in some species of honeysuckle, is, he\r\nsays, the primary cause of their adherence. This therefore does not\r\ndepend on the plan of symmetry, but upon an accident, which however is\r\nconstant in its appearance, owing to the specific constitution of such\r\nplants. In connection with the phenomena of adherence he next considers\r\nthe question whether a structure composed of several parts, as for\r\ninstance a compound ovary, should be considered as originally simple\r\nand afterwards divided into parts, or whether the converse is the true\r\naccount, and he says that we must examine each particular case and\r\ndecide which is the correct conception. Thus it may be shown that the\r\nperfoliate leaves of honeysuckles, as well as the involucres of many\r\nUmbelliferae, and monosepalous calyces and monopetalous corollas are\r\ndue to adherence, and he proceeds to prove that ovaries with several\r\nloculaments and several parts have in like manner been formed by\r\nadherence of two or more carpellary leaves, and concludes by pointing\r\nout the systematic importance of such considerations. Further on he\r\ntakes occasion to speak of the significance of the relative number\r\nof the parts of the flower, on which head he says much that is good,\r\nbut does not thoroughly investigate the matter; it was not till a\r\nlater time that Schimper’s doctrine of phyllotaxis made it possible to\r\nexpress these relations of number and position more precisely.\r\n\r\nHe concludes his rules for the application of his morphology to the\r\ndetermination of relations of affinity with the declaration, that the\r\nwhole art of natural classification consists in discerning the plan\r\nof symmetry, and in making abstraction of all the deviations from it\r\nwhich he has described,—much in the same way as the mineralogist seeks\r\nto discover the fundamental forms of crystals from the many derivative\r\nforms. It is obvious that all this teaching was a great step in advance\r\nupon the right path, that De Candolle has here given utterance for\r\nthe first time to an important principle of morphology and systematic\r\nbotany; nevertheless he did not succeed in always consistently carrying\r\nout his own principle; he was true to himself only in the determination\r\nof small groups of relationship; in framing the largest divisions of\r\nthe vegetable kingdom he entirely lost sight of the rule which he had\r\nhimself laid down, that the morphological character of organs and the\r\nextent to which it can be turned to account for systematic purposes is\r\nentirely independent of their physiological character, and that the\r\nmost important physiological characters are just those which are of\r\nquite subordinate importance in the determination of affinities. In\r\nspite of this strange inconsistency, to De Candolle belongs the merit\r\nof being the first to point emphatically to the distinction between\r\nmorphological and physiological marks, and to bring clearly to light\r\nthe discordance between morphological affinity and physiological habit;\r\nbut in this discordance lurks a problem, which could only be solved\r\nforty years later by Darwin’s theory of selection. A genuine inductive\r\nprocess alone could reveal these remarkable relations between the\r\nmorphological and physiological characters of organs. But it is at the\r\nsame time true that De Candolle could not have made this discovery,\r\nif his predecessors had not already established a large number of\r\naffinities. It was while he was engaged in an exact comparison of forms\r\nalready recognised as undoubtedly related to one another, that that\r\nwhich he called the plan of symmetry, and which was afterwards named\r\na type, revealed itself to him; and as he examined it more closely,\r\nand compared it with peculiarities of habit in different plants formed\r\non the same plan, he discovered certain causes, by means of which the\r\ndeviations were to be explained; these were abortion, degeneration,\r\nand adherence. By attending to these he succeeded in discovering\r\naffinities that had been hitherto doubtful or unknown; this was at all\r\nevents the true inductive way of advancing the system, and whatever\r\nthe earlier systematists had effected that was really valuable had\r\nbeen effected virtually in the same way, only they never arrived at a\r\nclear understanding of their own mode of proceeding; they had followed\r\nunconsciously the method which De Candolle clearly understood and\r\nconsciously pursued.\r\n\r\nThe majority of De Candolle’s successors were far from fully\r\nappreciating the entire significance of his theory, its importance as\r\na matter of method and principle; on the contrary in the search for\r\naffinities they continued to surrender themselves to a blind feeling\r\nrather than to a clearly recognised method, and the same must be\r\nsaid unhappily of De Candolle himself, when he was dealing with the\r\nestablishment of the large divisions of the vegetable kingdom. With\r\nequal surprise we find him in the book before us, in which he has\r\ndeveloped the true method in systematic botany, expressing the opinion\r\nthat the most important physiological characters must be employed for\r\nthe primary divisions of the system, and this idea is not improved\r\nby the fact that he ascribes to the organs physiological characters\r\nwhich they do not really possess; thus he regards the vessels as the\r\nmost important organs of nutrition, which they are not in fact, and\r\nupon this double error he builds his primary division of the whole\r\nvegetable kingdom into vascular and cellular plants, and then by a\r\nthird mistake believes that this division coincides with the division\r\nof plants into those which have and those which have not cotyledons.\r\nThe already established division into Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons,\r\nwhich rests upon a leading and purely morphological mark, is spoilt\r\nby De Candolle through his following Desfontaines in ascribing to\r\nthe Dicotyledons a different mode of growth in thickness from that\r\nof the Monocotyledons, and characterising the one as exogenous, the\r\nother as endogenous. But this notion is utterly incorrect, as von Mohl\r\nshowed twelve years later; and if it were correct, it would still be\r\nunimportant in a systematic point of view, because it appeals to a mark\r\nwhich is morphologically of quite subordinate importance. The worst\r\nconsequence of these mistakes was, that the Vascular Cryptogams were\r\nintroduced into the same class with the Monocotyledons,—a decided step\r\nbackwards, if we compare De Candolle’s system with that of Jussieu.\r\nIn spite of these grave defects in the primary divisions of the whole\r\nvegetable kingdom De Candolle’s system deserved the fame which it\r\nacquired and long maintained; it had this advantage over Jussieu’s\r\nsystem that in the class of Dicotyledons, the largest division of the\r\nwhole kingdom, larger subdivisions appeared, and these served to unite\r\nfamilies that were in many points essentially related; the Dicotyledons\r\nwere in fact divided first of all into two artificial groups according\r\nto the presence of two floral envelopes or one; the first and much\r\nthe larger of these was again broken up into a series of subordinate\r\ngroups, which pointed in many ways to natural affinities. That these\r\ngroups, which have only quite recently been materially altered, did to\r\na very considerable extent take account of natural affinities, is due\r\nto the fact that De Candolle in framing them really followed his own\r\nrules, whereas the superior divisions, which are artificial, owe their\r\nexistence to his disregard of them.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle declared emphatically against the old notion, that the\r\nvegetable system answers to a linear series,—a notion which sprang\r\nfrom a misunderstanding of the saying, ‘Natura non facit saltus,’—and\r\ndemonstrated its impossibility by examples; but he allowed himself\r\nto be too much influenced by the idea which had been thrown out by\r\nLinnaeus, and taken up by Giseke, Batsch, Bernardin de St. Pierre,\r\nL’Heritier, Du Petit-Thouars and others, that the vegetable kingdom\r\nmight be compared as respects its grouping to a geographical map, in\r\nwhich the quarters of the globe answer to the classes, the kingdoms\r\nto the families, and so on. If the theory of descent is to a certain\r\ndegree compatible with the idea of a linear sequence from the most\r\nimperfect to the highest forms of plants, it is quite incompatible\r\nwith the above comparison; and systematic investigation, led astray\r\nfrom the right path, is in danger of ascribing the importance of\r\nreal affinities to mere resemblances of habit, incidental analogies,\r\nby which a group of plants appears to be connected with five or six\r\nothers. In exhibiting his system on paper De Candolle allowed the use\r\nof the linear sequence as a convenience, for here it was not, he said,\r\na matter of any importance, since the true task of the science is to\r\nstudy the relations of symmetry in each family and the mutual relations\r\nof families to one another; yet in a linear presentation of the system\r\nfor didactic purposes the sequence ought not to begin with the most\r\nsimple plants, for these are the least known, but with the most highly\r\ndeveloped. Thus De Candolle was the means of removing from the system\r\nthe last trace of anything which harmonised with an ascending and\r\nuninterrupted development of forms. Resting on the doctrine of the\r\nconstancy of species, and assuming that every group of relationship is\r\nfounded on a plan of symmetry round which individual forms are grouped\r\nas crystals round their parent form, De Candolle was quite consistent\r\nin his views. The mode of representation came to prevail in the\r\nvegetable kingdom which De Candolle’s contemporary, Cuvier, an equally\r\nsturdy defender of the dogma of constancy, had introduced in the animal\r\nkingdom as the type-theory. Thus the most splendid results obtained by\r\ninduction were united in the case of De Candolle with the barren dogma\r\nof the constancy of species, which, as Lange wittily remarks, comes\r\ndirect from Noah’s ark, to form an intimate mixture of truth and error;\r\nnor did De Candolle’s many adherents succeed in unravelling the coil,\r\nthough they removed the chief errors from his system and introduced\r\nmany improvements.\r\n\r\nTo these remarks may be appended a table of the main divisions of De\r\nCandolle’s system of 1819, which so far as it is presented in linear\r\narrangement he calls expressly an artificial system.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. Vascular plants or plants with cotyledons.\r\n\r\n  1. Exogens or Dicotyledons.\r\n    A. With calyx and corolla:\r\n       Thalamiflorals (polypetalous hypogynous),\r\n       Calyciflorals (polypetalous perigynous),\r\n       Corolliflorals (gamopetalous).\r\n    B. Monochlamydeous plants (with a single floral envelope).\r\n\r\n  2. Endogens or Monocotyledons.\r\n    A. Phanerogams (true Monocotyledons),\r\n    B. Cryptogams (vascular Cryptogams including Naiadeae).\r\n\r\n\r\n  II. Cellular plants or Acotyledons.\r\n\r\n    A. With leaves (Muscineae),\r\n    B. Without leaves (Thallophytes).\r\n\r\nThe number of families, with Linnaeus 67, with A. L. de Jussieu 100,\r\nwas increased by De Candolle to 161.\r\n\r\nIf the principles of comparative morphology laid down by De Candolle\r\nwere at first prevented from being rapidly disseminated in Germany by\r\nthe philosophical tendencies then reigning among its botanists, and\r\nespecially by the obscurities of Goethe’s doctrine of metamorphosis,\r\nyet these principles and his views also on the natural system won\r\ntheir way by degrees to acknowledgment and acceptance; and after the\r\nyear 1830 the study of the system was prosecuted by the botanists of\r\nGermany, as well as by those of England and France, as the proper\r\nobject of the science. We may even say that the impulse given by De\r\nCandolle worked more powerfully from that time forward in Germany\r\nthan in France. It may be said too of De Candolle’s contemporary, the\r\nEnglishman ROBERT BROWN[38] (1773-1858), whose chief labours fall\r\nin the period between 1820 and 1840, that he, like De Candolle, was\r\nbetter appreciated during that time in Germany than in any other\r\ncountry. Robert Brown, who spent the five years from 1801 to 1805\r\nin Australia, studied the flora of that quarter of the world, and\r\ndiscussed in numerous essays the botanical results of various journeys\r\nmade by other naturalists in polar regions and in the tropics. In this\r\nway he found opportunity to leaven the ideas, which through Humboldt’s\r\ninfluence had become predominant respecting the geography of plants,\r\nwith the spirit of the natural system; he also made the morphology and\r\nsystematic position of a number of families the subject of critical\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nRobert Brown’s literary efforts were limited to these monographs; he\r\nnowhere attempted to give a connected account of the principles which\r\nhe follows in them, an exposition of his morphology or a theory of\r\nclassification, nor did he frame a new system. The results of his\r\nstudies which were really fruitful and served to advance the science\r\nare to be found in the more general remarks, which he managed to insert\r\nquite incidentally in his monographs. In this way he succeeded in\r\nclearing up the morphology of the flower and with it the systematic\r\nposition of some difficult families of plants, such as the Grasses,\r\nOrchids, Asclepiads, the newly-discovered Rafflesiaceae and others, and\r\nto throw new light at the same time on wider portions of the system;\r\nin his considerations on the structure and affinities of the most\r\nremarkable plants, which had been collected in Africa by different\r\ntravellers in the years immediately following 1820, he discussed\r\ndifficult and remarkable morphological relations in the structure\r\nof the flower. He referred especially in this essay (1826) to the\r\nrelations between the numbers of the stamens and carpels, and those of\r\nthe floral envelopes in the Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons, and showed\r\nhow these typical, or as he calls them in De Candolle’s phraseology,\r\nsymmetrical relations were changed by abortion, while he entered at\r\nthe same time into a more exact determination of the position of the\r\naborted and of the perfect organs, in order to discover new relations\r\nof affinity. His most valuable work in this direction is a paper on\r\na genus Kingia, discovered in New Holland in 1825; the structure of\r\nthe seeds in this genus led him to seek more accurate knowledge of the\r\nunfertilised ovule in the Phanerogams generally, and especially in\r\nthe Cycads and Conifers. In spite of the labours of Gärtner and the\r\nlater researches of Treviranus, there was still considerable obscurity\r\nattaching to the theory of the seed, for no one had yet succeeded in\r\nreferring the position of the embryo in the ripe seed to a general law.\r\nFor this it was necessary to submit the ovule before fertilisation\r\nto careful examination, and Robert Brown carried out this first step\r\nto a history of development with great success; he was the first to\r\ndistinguish the integuments and the nucleus in the ovule, and the\r\nembryo-sac in the nucleus, parts which Malpighi and Grew had indeed\r\nobserved but had not brought out with perfect clearness. The micropyle\r\nand the hilum of the seed had not yet been properly distinguished, but\r\nhad been to some extent even confounded with one another. Robert Brown\r\nshowed that the hilum answers to the point of attachment of the ovule,\r\nwhile the micropyle is a canal formed by the integuments of the ovule\r\nand leading to the summit of the nucleus; that in anatropous ovules\r\nthe micropyle lies beside the hilum, in orthotropous ovules opposite\r\nto it; that the embryo in the embryo-sac (amnion) is always formed at\r\nthe spot which lies nearest the micropyle, and that the radicle of the\r\nembryo is always turned towards the micropyle,—facts which at once\r\nestablished the general rule by which to determine the position of the\r\nembryo in the seed and in the fruit. He also gave the first correct\r\nexplanation of the endosperm as a nourishing substance formed inside\r\nthe embryo-sac after fertilisation, and more than this, he was the\r\nfirst to distinguish the perisperm as a substance formed outside the\r\nembryo-sac in the tissue of the nucleus.\r\n\r\nIn this way Robert Brown established morphological relations in the\r\norganisation of the seed of the Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons, which\r\ncount among the most important principles of classification in these\r\nclasses; he was still more happy in being the first to detect the\r\npeculiar structure of the flower of Conifers and Cycads, as compared\r\nwith that of other flowering plants; it was he who perceived that\r\nwhat had been hitherto called a female flower in these plants was\r\nreally a naked ovule, a view which Trew of Nüremberg had, it is true,\r\nsuggested in the year 1767. He also called attention to the agreement\r\nin structure of the male and female organs in these families. Thus\r\none of the most remarkable facts in vegetation, the gymnospermy of\r\nthe Conifers and Cycads, was for the first time established, and this\r\nled afterwards through Hofmeister’s investigations to the important\r\nresult, that the Gymnosperms, which had been up to that time classed\r\nwith Dicotyledons, are to be regarded as co-ordinate with Dicotyledons\r\nand Monocotyledons, forming a third class through which remarkable\r\nhomologies were brought to light in the propagation of the higher\r\nCryptogams and the formation of seeds in Phanerogams. No more important\r\ndiscovery was ever made in the domain of comparative morphology and\r\nsystematic botany. The first steps towards this result, which was\r\nclearly brought out by Hofmeister twenty-five years later, were secured\r\nby Robert Brown’s researches, and he was incidentally led to these\r\nresearches by some difficulties in the construction of the seed of an\r\nAustralian genus. He discussed in a similar manner, if not always with\r\nsuch important results, a great variety of questions in morphology\r\nand systematic botany; even purely physiological problems were raised\r\nby him in this peculiar way, and especially the question how the\r\nfertilising matter of the pollen-grains is conveyed to the ovule;\r\nhe had already concluded from the position of the embryo that it is\r\nconveyed through the micropyle and not through the raphe and the hilum,\r\nas was then supposed, and he was the first also to follow the passage\r\nof the pollen-tubes in the ovary of Orchids up to the ovules; but this\r\nis a point which will be more properly considered in the history of the\r\nsexual theory.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar character of the natural system as compared with every\r\nartificial arrangement is brought out into higher relief by Robert\r\nBrown than by Jussieu and De Candolle, and he succeeded better\r\nthan any of his predecessors in separating purely morphological\r\nand systematically valuable relations of organisation from the\r\nphysiological adaptations of organs. While the majority of systematists\r\nsurrendered themselves to the guidance of a blind feeling in the\r\ndiscovery of affinities, their correct determinations being the\r\naccidental result of instinct and unconscious operations of the\r\nunderstanding, Brown endeavoured to give an account to himself in every\r\ncase of the reasons why he took this or that view of the relationships\r\nwhich he determined; from what was already established and indubitable\r\nhe gathered the value of certain marks, in order to obtain rules for\r\nthe determination of unknown relationships. In this way he discovered\r\nalso, that marks, which are of great value for classification within\r\nthe limits of certain groups of affinity, may possibly prove to be\r\nvalueless in other divisions. Thus Robert Brown in his numerous\r\nmonographs supplied the model, by which others might be guided in\r\nfurther applying and completing the method of the natural system; and\r\nin this respect he was met by the botanists of Germany in the spirit\r\nof the best good-will and most profound appreciation, as is shown\r\nby the fact that a collection of his botanical works, translated by\r\ndifferent German botanists, was edited in five volumes by Nees von\r\nEsenbeck as early as the period between 1825 and 1834. The natural\r\nsystem established itself in Germany through the labours of Brown and\r\nDe Candolle; and the more correct appreciation of it as compared with\r\nthe sexual system of Linnaeus was promoted by a work of Carl Fuhlrott\r\nwhich appeared in 1829, in which the systems of Jussieu and De Candolle\r\nare compared with those of Agardh, Batsch, and Linnaeus, and the\r\nsuperiority of the natural system is clearly set forth. A still greater\r\neffect in this direction was produced by the appearance in 1830 of the\r\n‘Ordines naturales plantarum’ of Bartling, an independent contribution\r\nto this department of botany, and a distinct advance upon what had\r\nhitherto been effected. The contemporary monographs of Roeper on the\r\nEuphorbiaceae and Balsamineae and his treatise ‘De organis plantarum’\r\n(1828), are an able, independent, and logical application of the\r\nprinciples of the morphology of the flower laid down by De Candolle and\r\nBrown to the elucidation of morphological and systematic conceptions.\r\nBut the new methods of investigation introduced by De Candolle and\r\nRobert Brown had to encounter in Germany, and to some extent in France\r\nalso, not only the antiquated views of Linnaeus, but, what was still\r\nworse, the erroneous notions of the nature-philosophy founded by\r\nSchelling. The misty tenets of this philosophy could scarcely find\r\na more fruitful soil than the natural system with its mysterious\r\naffinities, and Goethe’s doctrine of metamorphosis contributed not\r\na little to increase the confusion. These historical phenomena will\r\nbe further considered in the following chapter; at present we are\r\nmore concerned to show how the professed systematists pursued the\r\npath opened by De Candolle and Brown. And here it must be noticed\r\nthat from about the year 1830, in Germany especially, morphological\r\nenquiry became separated as a special subject from systematic botany;\r\nit became more and more the fashion to treat the latter as independent\r\nof morphology, and thus to forsake the source of deeper insight which\r\ncomparative and genetic morphology alone can open to the systematist;\r\nmorphology on the other hand took a new flight, and as it thus\r\ndeveloped itself apart from pure systematic botany, its progress must\r\nbe described by itself in a later portion of this history.\r\n\r\nIf advance in systematic botany depended on the number of systems that\r\nwere proposed from 1825 to 1845, that period must be looked upon as\r\nits golden age; no less than twenty-four systems made their appearance\r\nduring these twenty years, without counting those which were inspired\r\nby the views of the nature-philosophy. There was great and spreading\r\ngrowth, but no corresponding depth; no really new points of view were\r\nopened for classification, and as regards the true principles of the\r\nnatural system there were symptoms of evident decline rather than of\r\nadvance, as will be shown below. Improvements were effected certainly\r\nin the details of the system, since botanists generally adhered to\r\nthe principles laid down by De Candolle, Jussieu, and Brown. Families\r\nwere cleared up and better defined, and groups of families were\r\nproposed which assumed more and more the appearance of natural cycles\r\nof relationship. The class more especially treated was the extensive\r\none of the Dicotyledons, in which the families, continually growing\r\nmore and more numerous, were in Jussieu’s arrangement a chaos, but had\r\nbeen united into larger groups in a somewhat artificial manner by De\r\nCandolle. Here we see once more how the formation of the system rises\r\nstep by step from the particular to the more general; at an earlier\r\nperiod genera were constructed out of species, and families out of\r\ngenera, and during the years from 1820 to 1845 the families were united\r\ninto more comprehensive groups; but these orders or classes were not\r\nyet grouped together in such a manner as to ensure the separation of\r\nthe largest divisions of the vegetable kingdom in a natural manner.\r\nThe great class of Dicotyledons is not even yet so arranged that the\r\nsmaller aggregates of families connect satisfactorily one with another.\r\nNevertheless a considerable advance was made by the establishment of a\r\nlarge number of smaller groups of families, and Bartling and Endlicher\r\nwere especially successful in founding such groups and supplying them\r\nwith names and characters.\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand we turn to the primary divisions of the vegetable\r\nkingdom, we find that certain large and natural groups came to be most\r\ngenerally recognised and placed in the front rank in every scheme; such\r\nwere the groups of the Thallophytes, Muscineae, Vascular Cryptogams,\r\nGymnosperms, Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons. But the coordination\r\nof these great divisions of the whole vegetable kingdom was far from\r\nbeing rightly understood. It was usage rather than anything else, which\r\ngradually put them forward as primary types; in the systems themselves\r\nsome received too great, others too little prominence, or other groups\r\nof doubtful character were admitted alongside of them. Bartling, for\r\ninstance, whose system up to 1850 or even longer may rank as one of\r\nthe most natural, adheres to De Candolle’s division of the vegetable\r\nkingdom into cellular and vascular plants, and rightly divides the\r\nformer into two main groups, Thallophytes and Muscineae (Homonemeae and\r\nHeteronemeae), while he separates the latter into Vascular Cryptogams\r\nand Phanerogams; but the Phanerogams are divided into Monocotyledons\r\nand Dicotyledons, which again are distributed into four groups, one\r\nof these being characterised by the presence of a vitellus, that is,\r\nof an endosperm surrounded by a perisperm,—a thoroughly artificial\r\ndivision. The three other divisions are named apetalous, monopetalous,\r\nand polypetalous, but the Coniferae and Cycadeae are placed in\r\nthe apetalous division. Less satisfactory is the primary division\r\ninto Thallophytes and Cormophytes proposed by ENDLICHER[39], the\r\nlatter separating into the divisions Acrobrya (Muscineae, Vascular\r\nCryptogams, and Cycads), Amphibrya (Monocotyledons), and Acramphibrya\r\n(Dicotyledons and Conifers); the names of the three latter groups,\r\nthe first of which is utterly unnatural, are founded on erroneous\r\nassumptions respecting growth in length and thickness, which Endlicher\r\nborrowed from Unger. While Endlicher’s great work has continued down\r\nto our own time to be indispensable to the botanist as a book of\r\nreference on account of the fulness of its descriptions of families\r\nand genera, the system projected by Brongniart in 1843 has acquired a\r\nsort of official authority in France. The whole vegetable kingdom is\r\nhere distributed into two divisions, Cryptogams and Phanerogams, and\r\nthe former are incorrectly characterised as asexual, the latter as\r\nhaving distinction of sex. The Phanerogams, divided into Monocotyledons\r\nand Dicotyledons, are distributed into groups in a manner that is\r\nnot satisfactory; but the system has one merit, that it keeps the\r\nGymnosperms together in one body; and if they are incorrectly classed\r\nwith the Dicotyledons, it was still a sign of progress, that Robert\r\nBrown’s discovery of gymnospermy was to some extent practically\r\nrecognised. The system devised by JOHN LINDLEY[40] attained to about\r\nthe same importance in England as attached to those of Bartling\r\nand Endlicher in Germany, and that of Brongniart in France. After\r\nvarious earlier attempts he proposed a system in 1845, in which, as\r\nin Brongniart’s arrangement, the Cryptogams are characterised as\r\nasexual or flowerless plants, the Phanerogams as sexual or flowering\r\nplants; the former are divided into Thallogens and Acrogens, the\r\nPhanerogams into five classes; (1) Rhizogens (Rafflesiaceae, Cytineae,\r\nBalanophorae); (2) Endogens (parallel-nerved Monocotyledons); (3)\r\nDictyogens (net-veined Monocotyledons); (4) Gymnogens (Gymnosperms);\r\n(5) Exogens (Dicotyledons). This classification is one of the most\r\nunfortunate that were ever attempted; the systematic value of the\r\nRhizogens is much overrated on account of their striking habit; the\r\nMonocotyledons are separated into two classes on the strength of an\r\nunimportant mark. The characters assigned to all these groups are on\r\nthe whole thoroughly faulty.\r\n\r\nThese systems have been selected for notice from among many others,\r\nbecause they attained an extended notoriety and importance from the\r\ncircumstance that their authors, Brongniart excepted, made them the\r\noccasions of comprehensive descriptions of the whole vegetable kingdom,\r\nand again because it would be superfluous for our present purpose to\r\nbestow a closer consideration on the systems of less eminent men.\r\nWhoever desires further information on the matter will find it in the\r\nintroduction to Lindley’s ‘Vegetable Kingdom’ of 1853.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the principles and points of view adopted in these\r\nsystems, one thing especially strikes us, that, except in the case\r\nof Bartling, physiologico-anatomical marks were employed along with\r\nmorphological ones to characterise the primary divisions; their authors\r\nfell into the mistake committed by De Candolle, and unfortunately\r\nthese very marks rested in part or wholly on misapprehensions, as in\r\nEndlicher’s division into Acrobrya, etc., and Lindley’s classes of\r\nRhizogens and Dictyogens. It was still more unfortunate that individual\r\nsystematists obstinately refused to accept well authenticated facts,\r\nwhich it is true had not been discovered by systematists, but were\r\nnevertheless of the highest value for the system. It is scarcely\r\ncredible that Lindley in 1845, and again in 1853, maintained the\r\ndistinction between endogenous and exogenous growth in stems, though\r\nHugo von Mohl had in 1831 produced decisive proof that this distinction\r\nlaid down by Desfontaines and adopted by De Candolle had no real\r\nexistence. The same was the case with the characters of the Cryptogams,\r\nin which the mark of having no sexual organs was repeatedly adopted\r\nas running through the whole class, although various instances of\r\nsexuality in Cryptogams were known before 1845; Schmidel had described\r\nthe sexual organs of the Liverworts about the middle of the previous\r\ncentury, Hedwig those of the Mosses in 1782, and Vaucher in 1803 had\r\nsuggested that the conjugation of Spirogyra among the Algae should be\r\nregarded as a sexual act; the systematists in fact did not know what to\r\nmake of these intimations.\r\n\r\nIt was again a misfortune that the systematists in their labours\r\noften neglected to distinguish between the search for marks and the\r\nuse to be made of them; the examination of all possible marks should\r\nlead to the establishing the systematic importance of certain fixed\r\nmarks or their value for classification. When research has done its\r\nwork, then it is sufficient in exhibiting the system to put forward\r\nonly the prominent marks; and frequently a single one suffices to\r\nunite a natural group. Such a leading mark is like the standard of a\r\nregiment; its significance is not great in itself, but it serves the\r\ngreat practical purpose of indicating a whole group of marks which are\r\nconnected with it. It was a still greater misfortune that scarcely any\r\nsystematist after De Candolle endeavoured to form a clear conception\r\nin his own mind of the principles on which the natural system must be\r\nelaborated, and to set them forth in a connected form as the theory\r\nof the system. The student had to accept the arrangement offered\r\nhim as a fact simply without understanding it, and the systematists\r\nthemselves usually followed only a blind feeling in the framing of\r\ntheir groups, and never unfolded the grounds of their proceeding\r\nwith logical distinctness. In this respect John Lindley forms an\r\nhonourable exception, inasmuch as he did, on several occasions after\r\n1830, give full expositions of his views on the principles of natural\r\nclassification, and like De Candolle endeavoured to develop a theory\r\nof the system[41]. But he deserves credit only for the endeavour,\r\nfor the principles themselves which he laid down are not only to a\r\ngreat extent incorrect, but they are opposed to his own and to every\r\nother natural system. We find this opposition between theory and\r\npractice much more strongly marked in Lindley than in De Candolle; the\r\ncases only are so far different, that De Candolle laid down correct\r\nprinciples for the determination of affinities, but in some cases\r\ndid not follow them, whereas Lindley deduced quite incorrect rules\r\nof system from existing and long-established natural affinities. The\r\nconsideration of all the systems framed up to the year 1853 shows\r\nclearly that the characters of truly natural groups are to be found\r\nonly in morphological marks; yet Lindley enunciates the principle that\r\na mark, or, as he incorrectly says, an organ, is more important for\r\nclassification in proportion as it possesses a higher physiological\r\nvalue for the preservation and propagation of the individual. If this\r\nwere true, nothing would be easier than to frame a natural system of\r\nplants; it would suffice to divide plants first of all into those\r\nwithout and those with chlorophyll, for the presence of chlorophyll\r\nis more essential than that of any other substance to the nourishment\r\nof plants, and its physiological importance is therefore pre-eminent;\r\nin that case of course such Orchideae as have no chlorophyll, the\r\nOrobancheae, Cuscuta, Rafflesia, etc., would form one class with the\r\nFungi, and all other plants the other. It is very important for the\r\nexistence of a plant whether its organisation is adapted to its growing\r\nin water, or on dry land, or underground, and if we took Lindley\r\nat his word, he would be obliged to bring the Algae, Rhizocarps,\r\nVallisnerias, water Ranunculuses, Lemna, etc., into one group. It is\r\nvery important for the existence of a plant whether it grows upright\r\nof itself, or climbs upwards by the aid of tendrils or of a twining\r\nstem or otherwise, and accordingly we might on Lindley’s principle\r\ncollect certain ferns, the vine, the passion-flower, many of the pea\r\nkind, etc., into one order. It is obvious that Lindley’s main axiom\r\nof systematic botany appears in this way utterly unreasonable; yet\r\nby this principle he judges of the systematic value of anatomical\r\ncharacters, those of the embryo and endosperm, of the corolla and the\r\nstamens, everywhere laying stress on their physiological importance,\r\nwhich in these parts has really little systematic value. This mode of\r\nproceeding on the part of Lindley, compared with his own system, which\r\nwith all its grave faults is still always a morphologically natural\r\nsystem, proves that like many other systematists, he did not literally\r\nand habitually follow the rules he himself laid down, for if he had,\r\nsomething very different from a natural system must have been the\r\nresult. The success which was really obtained in the determination of\r\naffinities was due chiefly to a correctness of feeling, formed and\r\ncontinually being perfected by constant consideration of the forms of\r\nplants. It was still therefore virtually the same association of ideas\r\nas in de l’Obel and Bauhin, operating to a great extent unconsciously,\r\nby which natural affinities were by degrees brought to light; and men\r\nlike Lindley, of pre-eminent importance as systematists, were, as the\r\nabove examples show, never clear about the very rules by which they\r\nworked. And yet in this way the natural system was greatly advanced in\r\nthe space of fifty years. The number of affinities actually recognised\r\nincreased with wonderful rapidity, as appears from a comparison of the\r\nsystems of Bartling, Endlicher, Brongniart, and Lindley, with those\r\nof De Candolle and Jussieu. Nothing shows the value of the systems\r\nthus produced before 1850 as classifications of the vegetable kingdom\r\nmore forcibly than the fact that a clear and methodical thinker like\r\nDarwin was able to draw from them the chief supports of the theory\r\nof descent. For it is quite certain that Darwin has not framed his\r\ntheory in opposition to morphology and system, and drawn it from any\r\nhitherto unknown principles; on the contrary, he has deduced his most\r\nimportant and most incontestable propositions directly from the facts\r\nof morphology and of the natural system, as it had been developed up to\r\nhis time. He is always pointing expressly to the fact that the natural\r\nsystem in the form in which it has come to him, which he accepts in the\r\nmain as the true one, is not built upon the physiological, but upon\r\nthe morphological value of organs; it may, he says, be laid down as a\r\nrule, that the less any portion of the organisation is bound up with\r\nspecial habits of life, the more important it is for classification.\r\nLike Robert Brown and De Candolle, he insists upon the high importance\r\nfor purposes of classification of aborted and physiologically useless\r\norgans; he points to cases in which very distant affinities are brought\r\nto light by numerous transition-forms or intermediate stages, of which\r\nthe class of the Crustaceae offers a specially striking example in\r\nthe animal kingdom, while certain series of forms of Thallophytes,\r\nthe Muscineae, the Aroideae and others, may be adduced as instances\r\nof the same kind in the vegetable world; in such cases the most\r\ndistant members of a series of affinities have sometimes no one common\r\nmark, which they do not share with all other plants of a much larger\r\ndivision. From these and other similar statements of Darwin we see\r\nplainly, that he actually did gather from existing natural systems\r\nof plants and animals the rules by which systematists had worked,\r\nbut which they themselves observed only more or less unconsciously,\r\nand never with a full and clear recognition of them. He says quite\r\nrightly, when the investigators of nature are practically engaged with\r\ntheir task, they do not trouble themselves about the physiological\r\nvalue of the characters which they employ for the limiting a group\r\nor the establishment of a single species. Darwin clearly perceived\r\nand consistently kept in view the discordance between the systematic\r\naffinity of organisms and their adaptation to the conditions of life,\r\nwhich De Candolle had already but imperfectly recognised. The clear\r\nperception of this discordance was in fact the one thing needed to\r\nmark the true character of the natural system, and to make the theory\r\nof descent appear as the only possible explanation of it. The fact\r\nwhich morphologists and systematists had painfully brought to light,\r\nbut had not sufficiently recognised in its full importance, that\r\ntwo entirely different principles are united in the nature of every\r\nindividual organism, that on the one hand the number, the arrangement,\r\nand the history of the development of the organs of a species point to\r\ncorresponding relations in many other species, while on the other hand\r\nthe manner of life and the consequent adaptation of the same organs\r\nmay be quite different in these allied species. This fact admits of no\r\nexplanation but the one given by the theory of descent; it is therefore\r\nthe historical cause and the strongest logical support of that theory,\r\nand the theory itself is directly deduced from the results which the\r\nefforts of the systematists have established. That the majority of\r\nsystematists did at first distinctly declare against the theory of\r\ndescent can surprise no one who observes that they were so little able\r\nto give an account of their own mode of procedure, as appears in so\r\nstriking a manner from Lindley’s theoretical speculations.\r\n\r\nOne consequence of this want of clearness in combination with the\r\ndogma of the constancy of species has been already mentioned in the\r\nintroduction; namely, the notion professedly adopted by Lindley,\r\nElias Fries, and others, that an idea lies at the foundation of every\r\ngroup of affinities, that the natural system is a representation of\r\nthe plan of creation. But the question, how such a plan of creation\r\ncould explain the strange fact that the physiological adaptations\r\nof organs to the conditions of life have nothing at all to do with\r\ntheir systematic connection, was quietly disregarded; and in fact the\r\nnotion, founded on Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy, of a plan\r\nof creation and of ideal forms underlying systematic groups, could\r\nnot explain this discordance between morphological and physiological\r\ncharacters. It would be easy to maintain the view of the systematists,\r\nthat the natural system represents a plan of creation, if physiological\r\nand morphological characters went always truly hand in hand, if the\r\nadaptation of the organs to the conditions of life in the species were\r\nperfect; but facts show that the adaptation is in the best of cases\r\ncomparatively imperfect, and that it is in all cases brought about by\r\nthe accommodation to new requirements of organs which originally served\r\nto other functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMORPHOLOGY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DOCTRINE OF METAMORPHOSIS AND OF\r\n                          THE SPIRAL THEORY.\r\n\r\n                              1790-1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe efforts of Jussieu, De Candolle, and Robert Brown were directed to\r\nthe discovery of the relationship between different species of plants\r\nby comparing them together; the doctrine of metamorphosis founded\r\nby Goethe set itself from the first to bring to light the hidden\r\nrelationship between the different organs of one and the same plant.\r\nAs De Candolle’s doctrine of symmetry derived the different species\r\nof plants from an ideal plan of symmetry or type, so the doctrine\r\nof metamorphosis assumed an ideal fundamental organ, from which the\r\ndifferent leaf-forms in a plant could be derived. The stem came into\r\nconsideration only as carrying the leaves, the root was almost entirely\r\ndisregarded. As the resemblance of nearly allied species of plants\r\nsuggests itself naturally and unsought to the mind of the unbiassed\r\nobserver, so also does the connection between different organs of a\r\nleafy nature in one and the same plant. Cesalpino called the corolla\r\nsimply a ‘folium’ (leaf); he and Malpighi regarded the cotyledons also\r\nas leaves; Jung called attention to the variety of the leaf-forms,\r\nwhich are found in many plants at different heights on the same stem;\r\nCaspar Friedrich Wolff, the first who bestowed systematic consideration\r\non the subject, declared in 1766, that he saw nothing ultimately in\r\nthe plant but leaves and stem, including the root in the stem[42].\r\n\r\nLong before Goethe’s time speculation had busied itself with attempts\r\nto explain these observations; we saw how Cesalpino and Linnaeus,\r\nstarting from the old view that the pith is the seat of the soul in\r\nplants, regarded the seeds as metamorphosed pith, the floral envelopes\r\nwith the stamens and the true leaves as metamorphosed layers of the\r\nrind and wood of the stem. The word metamorphosis from their point\r\nof view had a very plain meaning; it was really the cylindrical pith\r\nwhose upper end changed into seeds, it was the actual substance of the\r\ncortex which produced both the ordinary leaves and the parts of the\r\nflower. Wolff on the other hand from a point of view of his own gave\r\nan apparently intelligible physical explanation of the proposition,\r\nthat all appendages of the stem are leaves, but the explanation had\r\nthe fault of not being true; he attributed the metamorphosis of leaves\r\nto altered nourishment, the flowers especially to his ‘vegetatio\r\nlanguescens.’\r\n\r\nGOETHE’S conception of the matter was from the first much less\r\nclear, and chiefly because he was never able to bring the abnormal\r\ninto its true connection with the normal or ascending metamorphosis.\r\nIn the first sentence of his ‘Doctrine of metamorphosis’ (1790) he\r\nsays, ‘that it is open to observation that certain exterior parts of\r\nplants sometimes change and pass into the form of adjacent parts,\r\neither wholly or in a greater or less degree.’ In the cases of\r\nwhich Goethe is here thinking a distinct meaning can be affixed to\r\nthe word metamorphosis; if, for example, the seeds of a plant with\r\nnormal flowers produce a plant which has petals in place of stamens,\r\nor in which the ovaries are resolved into green expanded leaves, it\r\nis actually the case that a plant of a known form has given rise\r\nto another plant of a different form, in other words, a change or\r\nmetamorphosis has really taken place. But we cannot reason in this\r\nway in the case of that which Goethe calls normal or ascending\r\nmetamorphosis. When in a given species, which has remained constant\r\nwith all its marks for countless generations, the cotyledons, the\r\nleaves, the bracts, and the parts of the flower are called leaves,\r\nthis must be merely the result of abstraction, which has led to the\r\ngeneralising of the idea of a leaf; if we make abstraction of the\r\nphysiological characters of the carpels, stamens, floral envelopes,\r\nand cotyledons, and regard only the way in which they originate on\r\nthe stem, we are justified in including them in one general idea\r\nwith ordinary leaves, and to this idea we quite arbitrarily give\r\nthe name leaf. But this does not justify us in speaking of a change\r\nof these organs, so long as we consider the whole plant in question\r\nas a hereditary and constant form. For the plant therefore taken as\r\nconstant the idea of metamorphosis has only a figurative meaning; the\r\nabstraction performed by the mind is transferred to the object itself,\r\nif we ascribe to it a metamorphosis which has really taken place only\r\nin our conception. The case would be different, if here as well as in\r\nthe abnormal instances above-mentioned we could assume that the stamens\r\nand other organs of the plants lying before us were ordinary leaves in\r\ntheir progenitors. So long as this assumption of an actual change is\r\nnot even hypothetically made, the expression change or metamorphosis is\r\npurely figurative, the metamorphosis is a mere ‘idea.’ This distinction\r\nGoethe has not made; he did not clearly see that his normal ascending\r\nmetamorphosis can only have the meaning of a scientific fact, if a\r\nreal change is assumed to take place in the course of propagation\r\nin this case, as in that of abnormal metamorphosis or misformation.\r\nA comparison of his various expressions shows that he took the word\r\nmetamorphosis sometimes in its literal, sometimes in its ideal and\r\nfigurative sense; for instance, he says expressly, ‘We may say that\r\na stamen is a folded petal, just as we may say that a petal is a\r\nstamen in a state of expansion.’ This sentence shows that Goethe did\r\nnot regard a particular leaf-form as first in time, and that others\r\nproceeded from it by change; he uses the word metamorphosis in a purely\r\nideal sense. At other times his remarks may be interpreted as though\r\nhe really considered the normal ascending metamorphosis to be a real\r\nchange in the organs, arising from a transmutation of the species.\r\nWith this confusion of notion and thing, idea and reality, subjective\r\nconception and objective existence, Goethe took up exactly the position\r\nof the so-called nature-philosophy.\r\n\r\nGoethe’s doctrine could only make its way to logical consistency and\r\nclearness of thought by deciding for the one or the other way; he must\r\neither assume that the different leaf-forms, which were regarded as\r\nalike only in the idea, were really produced by change of a previous\r\nform,—a conception that at once presupposes a change of species\r\nin time; or he must entirely adopt the position of the idealistic\r\nphilosophy, in which idea and reality coincide. In this case the\r\nassumption of a change in time was not necessary; the metamorphosis\r\nremained an ideal one, a mere mode of view; the word leaf then\r\nsignifies only an ideal fundamental form from which the different forms\r\nof leaves actually observed may be derived, as De Candolle’s constant\r\nspecies from an ideal type.\r\n\r\nIf now we read Goethe’s further remarks on the doctrine of\r\nmetamorphosis attentively[43], we perceive that he really arrived at\r\nneither of these conclusions, but perpetually vacillated between the\r\ntwo; a number of his sayings might be collected, which might be taken\r\nfor precursors of a theory of descent, as they have been taken by some\r\nmodern writers; but it is quite as easy to make a selection which would\r\ncarry us back to the position of the ideal philosophy and the constancy\r\nof species. In the later years of his life the idea of a physical\r\nmetamorphosis accomplished in time, and involving a change of species,\r\ndoes appear more distinctly in Goethe’s writings. This explains\r\nthe lively, nay passionate, interest which he took in the dispute\r\nbetween Cuvier and Geoffrey de St. Hilaire in 1830[44]. We gather from\r\nit that Goethe, in spite of all his wanderings in the mists of the\r\nnature-philosophy of the time, felt a growing need for some clearer\r\ninsight into the nature of metamorphosis, both in plants and animals,\r\nwithout ever being able to make his way into the clear light.\r\n\r\nBut these better motions remained without importance for the history of\r\nbotany; the adherents of his doctrine of metamorphosis all apprehended\r\nit in the sense of the nature-philosophy, and Goethe himself did\r\nnot remonstrate against the frightful way in which it was distorted\r\nby them. Its further development therefore was in accordance with\r\nthe principles of that philosophy, which was accustomed to apply\r\nthe results of purely idealistic views in an uncritical way to\r\nimperfectly observed facts. Above all the difficulty remained unsolved,\r\nhow the dogma of the constancy of species was to be brought into\r\nlogical connection with the idea of the metamorphosis of organs. The\r\nsupranatural, which Elias Fries found in the natural system, subsisted\r\nstill in the doctrine of metamorphosis in comparing the organs of a\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nStill more obscure and entirely the product of the nature-philosophy is\r\nGoethe’s view of the spiral tendency in vegetation. At p. 194 of his\r\nessay entitled ‘Spiraltendenz der Vegetation’ (1831) he says: ‘Having\r\nfully grasped the idea of metamorphosis we next turn our attention to\r\nthe vertical tendency, in order to gain a nearer acquaintance with\r\nthe development of the plant. This tendency must be looked upon as an\r\nimmaterial staff, which supports the existence.... This principle of\r\nlife (!) manifests itself in the longitudinal fibres which we use as\r\nflexible threads for many purposes; it is this which forms the wood in\r\ntrees, which keeps annual and biennial plants erect, and even produces\r\nthe extension from node to node in climbing and creeping plants. Next\r\nwe have to observe the spiral direction which winds round the other.’\r\nThis spiral direction which passes at once with Goethe into a ‘spiral\r\ntendency,’ is seen in various phenomena of vegetation, as in spiral\r\nvessels, in twining stems, and sometimes in the position of leaves.\r\nThe closing remarks of this short essay, in which he explains the\r\nvertical tendency as the male, the spiral as the female principle in\r\nthe plant, show how far Goethe lost himself in the profundities of the\r\nnature-philosophy. Thus he introduced his readers into the deepest\r\ndepths of mysticism.\r\n\r\nIt would be as useless as it would be wearisome to follow out in detail\r\nto its extremest point of absurdity the progressive transformation\r\nwhich the doctrine of metamorphosis underwent in the hands of the\r\nbotanists of the nature-philosophy school, and to see how its\r\ncatchwords, polarity, contraction and expansion, the stem-like and\r\nthe fistular, anaphytosis and life-nodes, and others, were compounded\r\nwith the results of the most every-day observation into meaningless\r\nconglomerates; rough obscure impressions of the sense, as well as\r\nincidental fancies, were regarded as ideas and principles. A full\r\naccount of these inconceivable aberrations is to be found in Wigand’s\r\n‘Geschichte und Kritik der Metamorphose.’ Our own countrymen certainly,\r\nVoigt, Kieser, Nees von Esenbeck, C. H. Schulz, and Ernst Meyer\r\n(the historian of botany) bear off the palm of absurdity, but there\r\nwere others also, among them the Swedish botanist Agardh, and some\r\nFrenchmen, Turpin, for instance, and Du Petit-Thouars[45], who were not\r\naltogether free from this weakness. Even the best German botanists\r\nof the time, such as Ludolph Treviranus, Link, G. W. Bischoff, and\r\nothers, managed to escape the influence of this philosophy of nature,\r\nonly where they confined themselves to the most barren empiricism.\r\nStrange phenomenon! that as soon as gifted and understanding men began\r\nto talk of the metamorphosis of plants, they fell into senseless\r\nphrase-mongering; Ernst Meyer, for instance, was it is true no great\r\nbotanist, but he shows in his ‘Geschichte der Botanik’ that he\r\npossessed a clever and cultivated intellect. The painful impression,\r\nwhich the treatment of the doctrine of metamorphosis by these writers\r\nmakes upon us, is due partly to the fact that the deeper meaning\r\nof the idealistic philosophy never attained to logical expression\r\nin their hands, and still more to their indulgence in an unmeaning\r\nplay of phrases, combining the highest abstractions with the most\r\nnegligent and rudest empiricism, and sometimes with utterly incorrect\r\nobservations. Oken can claim the merit of more correct observation and\r\ngreater philosophical consistency, and if we reject his views, yet\r\nhis mode of presenting them has at least the pleasing appearance of\r\nmore consequential reasoning. We perceive for the first time the full\r\ngreatness of the debt which modern botany owes to men like Pyrame de\r\nCandolle, Robert Brown, von Mohl, Schleiden, Nägeli, and Unger, the\r\nlatter of whom only slowly worked his way out of the trammels of the\r\nnature-philosophy, when we compare the literature of the doctrine of\r\nmetamorphosis before the year 1840 with the present condition of our\r\nscience, for which they paved the way.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the real and apparent differences between Goethe’s\r\ndoctrine of metamorphosis and De Candolle’s doctrine of a plan of\r\nsymmetry, these writers agreed in this, that they set out alike from\r\nthe doctrine of the constancy of species, and led up equally to the\r\nresult, that alongside of manifold physiological differences in the\r\norgans of plants certain points of formal agreement can be discovered,\r\nwhich are expressed chiefly in the order of their succession and in\r\ntheir relative positions. In this distinction lay the good kernel\r\nof the doctrine of metamorphosis in Goethe, and Wolff, and even in\r\nLinnaeus and Cesalpino: it was only necessary to set this free from\r\nthe dross with which the nature-philosophy had surrounded it, and\r\nto make the relations of position in organs the subject of earnest\r\ninvestigation, in order to secure important results in this branch\r\nof morphology. The first step in this direction was taken by Carl\r\nFriedrich Schimper, who was followed by Alexander Braun; both adopted\r\nthe main idea of the doctrine of metamorphosis in the form in which it\r\ncan be reconciled with the doctrine of constancy, that is, in a purely\r\nidealistic sense. Both liberated themselves from the gross errors of\r\nthe nature-philosophers, and thus gave a more logical expression to the\r\npurely idealistic morphological consideration of form in plants.\r\n\r\nKARL FRIEDRICH SCHIMPER[46] founded before the year 1830 the theory\r\nof the arrangement of leaves which is named after him, and which\r\nhe expounded to the naturalists assembled at Stuttgart in 1834 as\r\na complete and perfected system. Alexander Braun, in a review of\r\nSchimper’s exposition in ‘Flora’ of 1835, gave a clear and simple\r\naccount of the theory, having already himself published an excellent\r\nand comprehensive treatise on the same subject. The doctrine of\r\nphyllotaxis appeared in these publications with a formal completeness\r\nwhich could not fail to attract the attention of the botanical world\r\nand indeed of a larger audience; and justly so, for, as unfortunately\r\nso very seldom happens in botanical subjects, a scientific idea was in\r\nthis case not merely incidentally suggested, but was worked out in all\r\nits consequences as a complete structure, and this structure gained in\r\nexternal splendour from the circumstance that its propositions, dealing\r\nwith geometrical constructions, could be expressed in numbers and\r\nformulae,—a thing hitherto unknown in botanical science.\r\n\r\nThat the leaves are arranged on the stems that produce them according\r\nto fixed geometrical rules had been noticed by Cesalpino and by\r\nBonnet in the middle of the eighteenth century; but nothing more\r\nresulted than weak attempts at mere description of different cases.\r\nSchimper’s theory is marked by that which is at once its greatest\r\nmerit and its fundamental error, the referring of all relations of\r\nposition to a single principle. This principle lies in the idea\r\nthat growth in a stem has an upward direction in a spiral line, and\r\nthat the formation of leaves is a local exaggeration of this spiral\r\ngrowth. The direction of the spiral line may change in the same\r\nspecies, or in the same axis, and may even change from leaf to leaf.\r\nThe important variations in the arrangement of leaves are not shown\r\nin their longitudinal distances, but in the measure of their lateral\r\ndeviations on the stem. The characteristic point in this theory is the\r\nmode of considering these lateral deviations or divergences of the\r\nleaves as they follow one another on an axis, the referring them to a\r\nmore general law of position. Means were at the same time skilfully\r\nsupplied for discovering the true conditions of arrangement, the\r\ngenetic spiral, in cases where the genetic succession of the leaves,\r\nand consequently their divergence, could not be immediately recognised.\r\nAfter innumerable observations, it appeared that there is a wonderful\r\nvariety in the disposition of leaves, but that at the same time a\r\ncomparatively small number of these variations commonly occur, and\r\nthat these ordinary divergences 1/2, 2/3, 3/8, 8/13, 13/21, etc. have\r\nthis remarkable relation to one another, that both the numerator and\r\ndenominator of each successive fraction are obtained by adding together\r\nthe numerators and denominators of the two preceding fractions, or\r\nthe individual fractions named are the successive convergents of a\r\ncontinuous fraction:—\r\n\r\n  1\r\n  1 + 1\r\n      ——-\r\n      1 + 1\r\n          ——-\r\n          1....\r\n\r\nBy change of single cyphers in this, the simplest of all continuous\r\nfractions, the expressions were also obtained for all measures of\r\nposition that deviate from the usual main series. The common occurrence\r\nof so-called leaf-whorls seemed at once to be opposed to the principle\r\nof special growth and to the doctrine of position founded upon it,\r\nespecially in the cases in which it was supposed that all the leaves\r\nof a whorl arise simultaneously. But the founders of the doctrine,\r\nrelying on their geometrical constructions, declared that every\r\ntheory is incorrect, which sets out from the whorl as a simultaneous\r\nformation. But the way in which the different leaf-whorls of a stem are\r\narranged among themselves, and are connected with continuous spiral\r\npositions, required new geometrical constructions; it was necessary\r\nto assume a supplementary relation (prosenthesis), which the measure\r\nof the phyllotaxis adopts in the transition from the last leaf of\r\none cycle to the first of the next. Artificial as this construction\r\nappears, it has the advantage of saving the spiral principle, and the\r\nprosenthetic relation itself admits of being again expressed in highly\r\nsimple fractions,—a great advantage for the formal consideration of\r\nthe relative positions of the parts of the flower, and their relation\r\nto the preceding positions of the leaves. The great skill shown by the\r\nfounders of the doctrine in the morphological consideration of the\r\nwhole plant-form appears equally in the establishment of the rules,\r\naccording to which the relations of position of the leaves of a\r\nside-shoot connect with those of the mother-axis, and which made it\r\npossible to represent the nature of inflorescences especially with\r\nextreme clearness by means of geometrical figures. An expressive and\r\nelegant terminology not only made the whole theory attractive, but\r\nfitted it in a high degree to supply a suitable, plain, and precise\r\nphraseology for describing the most varied forms of plants. That the\r\ntheory possesses such advantages as these may be gathered from the\r\nfact, that since 1835 the morphological examination and comparison\r\nnot only of flowers and inflorescences, but also of vegetative shoots\r\nand their ramification, has reached great formal completeness. A\r\nthorough acquaintance with the principle of this doctrine has made it\r\npossible to explain to reader or hearer the most intricate forms of\r\nplants so clearly, that they may be said to reveal the law of their\r\nformation themselves, and to grow before the eye of the observer,\r\nwhile at the same time the most recondite relations of the organs of\r\nthe same or of different plants were brought out distinctly and in\r\nelegant phraseology. When this mode of description was combined with\r\nDe Candolle’s views on abortion, degeneration, and adherence, and at\r\nthe same time took into consideration the chief physiological forms\r\nof leaf-structures, according as these were developed as scales,\r\nfoliage-leaves, bracts, floral envelopes, staminal and carpellary\r\nleaves, it was possible to give such an artistic account of every form\r\nof plant, as made it visible to sense in its entirety, and at the same\r\ntime brought out the morphological law of its construction. Whoever\r\nreads the writings of Alexander Braun and Wydler, and especially of\r\nThilo Irmisch (after 1873), who knew how to combine his descriptions in\r\na variety of ways with remarks on the biological relations of plants,\r\ncannot fail to admire the extraordinary skill displayed by these men in\r\ndescribing plants. Compared with the dry diagnoses of the systematists,\r\ntheir descriptions attain to the dignity of an art, and present the\r\ncommonest forms to the reader in a new and attractive light. But the\r\ntheory had a further advantage; it seemed not only to present the form\r\nof the plant in its matured state, but to treat it genetically; and\r\nin fact it did possess an element of historical development, inasmuch\r\nas it made the genetic succession of the leaves and of their axillary\r\nshoots, which is at the same time the succession from the base to the\r\nsummit, the foundation of all consideration of the plant-form. But it\r\nis also true that in this lay one of the weak sides of the theory; as\r\nlong as it was a question only of continuous spirals, the succession of\r\nmatured leaves does also represent the succession of their formation\r\nin time; but this was not actually proved in the case of leaf-whorls,\r\nand here, to save the theory, genetic relations had to be presupposed\r\nfor which no further proof was forthcoming, while fresh researches\r\nhave repeatedly shown that a strict application of Schimper’s theory\r\nis found frequently to contradict the facts of development as directly\r\nobserved[47]. Moreover, regard was had only to those measurements\r\nof divergence on the continuous genetic spiral which were taken on\r\nthe matured stem, while there was always the possibility that the\r\ndivergences might have been different at the first, and been afterwards\r\nmodified, as Nägeli subsequently suggested[48]. And again, the theory\r\nhad a dangerous adversary to encounter in the frequent occurrence\r\nof leaves that are strictly alternate or crossed in pairs, and to\r\nconceive of this as a spiral arrangement must at once appear to be\r\nan arbitrary proceeding both from the mathematical point of view and\r\nfrom that of historical development; the assumption of a return of the\r\ngenetic spiral from leaf to leaf, as for instance in the Grasses, like\r\nthe prosenthesis in the change of divergence, afforded, it is true, a\r\nconstruction which was geometrically correct, but which could hardly\r\nbe made to agree with the history of development and the mechanical\r\nforces concerned. Again, it was a great and essential defect in the\r\ntheory, that in assuming the spiral arrangement it entirely neglected\r\nthe relations of symmetry of the plant-form, which are in many cases\r\nclearly expressed, and their connection with the outer world, on\r\nwhich Hugo von Mohl had already published some excellent remarks in\r\n1836,—a defect, which unhappily is not yet sufficiently appreciated. A\r\ndue consideration of these objections, and of the cases in which the\r\nhistory of development is opposed to the constructions of the theory,\r\nmust have led to the conviction that the idea of a spiral tendency in\r\nthe growth of plants is at least not borne out in all cases, and more\r\nprofound reflexion would show, that a scientific principle, really\r\nexplaining the phenomena, is no more to be found in the assumption\r\nof such a general tendency, than in a like assumption with regard to\r\nthe heavenly bodies, that they have a tendency to elliptic movement\r\nbecause they commonly move in ellipses. Hence Hofmeister, the latest\r\ninvestigator of the doctrine of phyllotaxis on the basis of the\r\nhistory of development, comes to the conclusion that the notion of a\r\nscrew-shaped or spiral course of evolution of lateral members of plants\r\nis not merely an unsuitable hypothesis, but an error. Its unreserved\r\nabandonment is, he considers, the first condition for attaining an\r\ninsight into the proximate causes of the varieties of relative position\r\nin the vegetable kingdom. But this judgment, correct as it is, was\r\npronounced thirty years after the appearance of Schimper’s theory;\r\nhistory, which speaks from another point of view, and not only enquires\r\ninto the correctness of a theory but has to appraise its historical\r\nimportance, speaks in a less unfavourable manner. The chief point here\r\nis not whether the theory was right, but how far it contributed to the\r\nadvance of the science. It was distinctly fruitful in results, for it\r\nbrought the important question of the relative positions of organs\r\nfor the first time into the front rank in the study of morphology; we\r\nmay even say that a large part of the results of the study of the\r\nhistory of development were first brought into the true light by the\r\nconsistent application of the theory, or in the effort to disprove it.\r\nWith all its fundamental errors, Schimper’s theory remains one of the\r\nmost interesting phenomena in the history of morphology, because it was\r\ncarried out with thorough logical consistency. We should as little wish\r\nto omit it from our literature, as modern astronomy would wish to see\r\nthe old theory of epicycles disappear from its history. Both theories\r\nserved to connect together the facts that were known in their time.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental error of the theory lies much deeper than appears at\r\nfirst sight. Here too we have the idealistic conception of nature,\r\nwhich refuses to know anything of the causal nexus, because it takes\r\norganic forms for the ever-recurring copies of eternal ideas, and\r\nin accordance with this platonic sphere of thought confounds the\r\nabstractions of the mind with the objective existence of things. This\r\nconfusion shows itself in Schimper’s doctrine, inasmuch as he takes\r\nthe geometrical constructions, which he transfers to his plants and\r\nwhich, though they may be highly suitable from his point of view, are\r\nnevertheless purely arbitrary, for actual characters of the plants\r\nthemselves, in other words, takes the subjective connection of the\r\nleaves by a spiral line for a tendency inherent in the nature of the\r\nplant. Schimper in making his constructions overlooked the fact that,\r\nbecause a circle can be described by turning a radius round one of its\r\nextremities, it does not follow that circular surfaces in nature must\r\nreally have been formed in this way; in other words, he did not see\r\nthat the geometrical consideration of arrangements in space, useful as\r\nit may otherwise be, gives no account of the causes to which they are\r\ndue. But this was not properly an oversight in Schimper’s case, for he\r\nwould have scarcely admitted efficient causes in the true scientific\r\nsense into his explanations of the form of plants. How far Schimper\r\nwas from regarding plants as something coming into being in time and\r\naccording to natural laws, how profoundly he despised the principles of\r\nmodern natural science is shown in his judgment of Darwin’s theory of\r\ndescent and of the modern atomic theory, the coarseness of which is the\r\nmore surprising, because Schimper was a man of refined and even poetic\r\nfeeling. ‘Darwin’s doctrine of breeding,’ he says, ‘is, as I discovered\r\nat once and could not help perceiving more and more after repeated and\r\ncareful perusal, the most shortsighted possible, most stupidly mean and\r\nbrutal, much more paltry even than that of the tesselated atoms with\r\nwhich a modern buffoon and hired forger has tried to entertain us.’\r\nHere is the old platonic view of nature flying at modern science; the\r\nsternest ‘opposites’ that culture has ever produced.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Schimper, which should rather be called the theory of\r\nSchimper and Braun, considering the active part which Braun took\r\nfrom the first in framing and applying it, was capable of further\r\ndevelopment only in the mathematical and formal direction, as was shown\r\nespecially in Naumann’s essay, ‘Ueber den Quincunx als Grundgesetz der\r\nBlattstellung vieler Pflanzen’ (1845). The defects above described, but\r\nnot the merits of the theory were shared by the doctrine of phyllotaxis\r\nlaid down about ten years later by the brothers Louis and Auguste\r\nBravais. Their theory makes use of mathematical formulae to even a\r\ngreater extent than that of Schimper without paying any attention to\r\ngenetic conditions, and yet it is less consistent with itself, for it\r\nassumes two thoroughly different kinds of phyllotaxis, the positions\r\nin which are arranged in a straight and in a curved line; for the\r\nlatter without any apparent reason a purely ideal original divergence\r\nis assumed which stands in irrational relation to the circumference of\r\nthe stem, and from it all other divergences should be derivable; and\r\nthis ultimately degenerates into mere playing with figures which in\r\nthis form afford no deeper insight into the causes of the relations of\r\nposition. As regards serviceableness in the methodic description of\r\nplants the theory of the brothers Bravais is much inferior to that of\r\nSchimper[49].\r\n\r\nThe genetic morphology founded about the year 1840 had to make the best\r\nterms it could with the doctrine of phyllotaxis, which was constructed\r\non a totally different principle; the two went their way on the whole\r\nside by side without disturbance from one another till the year 1868,\r\nwhen Hofmeister in his general morphology attacked the principle\r\nof Schimper’s theory, and endeavoured to substitute a genetic and\r\nmechanical explanation of the relative positions for the purely formal\r\naccount of them; this attempt however, which from the nature of the\r\ncase has not yet led to a finished theory but nevertheless contains the\r\ngerm of a further development of this important doctrine, does not come\r\nwithin the scope of this history.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of phyllotaxis of Schimper and Braun, as it appeared\r\nafter 1830, had clearly presented only one side of the theory of\r\nmetamorphosis; what other elements there were in it capable of being\r\nturned to speculative account were further cultivated by ALEXANDER\r\nBRAUN between the years 1840 and 1860. In this period fresh points of\r\nview were asserting themselves in botanical research; the founding of\r\nthe doctrine of cells, the study of the more delicate anatomy of plants\r\nand of the history of development, and increased methodical knowledge\r\nof the Cryptogams were enlarging the repertory of botanical facts,\r\nwhile the physico-mechanical method of investigation was being more and\r\nmore adopted. Braun, who took an active part by his own researches in\r\nthis revolution in morphological botany, remained true nevertheless to\r\nidealistic views; and in his frequent and comprehensive discussions of\r\nthe general results of the new investigations in accordance with these\r\nviews he has shown how far the idealistic platonising contemplation\r\nof nature is in a condition to do justice to the results of exact\r\ninductive enquiry. The opposition between his point of view and that\r\nof the most eminent representatives of the inductive method became\r\nmore and more pronounced as years went on, and must be treated here\r\nas a historical fact. But if the new tendency in botany pursued\r\nespecially by von Mohl, Schleiden, Nägeli, Unger, and Hofmeister may\r\nbe called inductive in the absence of a better term, and be contrasted\r\nwith the idealistic tendency represented by Braun and his school, it\r\nmust not be supposed that the latter did not equally contribute in\r\nmatters of detail to the enriching of the science by the method of\r\ninduction; on the contrary, Braun himself was the author of a series\r\nof important works conceived in this spirit. When the new method is\r\nhere called inductive, it should be understood that the word is used\r\nin a higher than the usual sense, and some explanation of this point\r\nwill not be superfluous in this place. Idealistic views of nature of\r\nall times, whether they present themselves as Platonism, Aristotelian\r\nlogic, Scholasticism or modern Idealism, have all of them this in\r\ncommon, that they regard the highest knowledge attainable by man\r\nas something already won and established; the highest axioms, the\r\nmost comprehensive truths are supposed to be already known, and the\r\ntask of inductive enquiry is essentially that of verifying them; the\r\nresults of observation serve to elucidate already received views,\r\nto illustrate already known truths; inductive enquiry has only to\r\nestablish individual facts. But in the sense in which inductive enquiry\r\nwas understood by Bacon, Locke, Hume, Kant, and Lange, its task is one\r\nthat goes essentially farther than this; it must not be content with\r\nestablishing individual facts, but it must employ them in the critical\r\nexamination of the most general notions that have come down to us,\r\nand do its best to deduce new and comprehensive theories from them,\r\neven where these may be entirely opposed to traditional views. But it\r\nis part of the very nature of this method of investigation, that its\r\ngeneral results are subject to constant modification and improvement;\r\neach more general truth has only a temporary value, and endures as\r\nlong as no new facts militate against it. The distinction therefore\r\nbetween idealism and the inductive method in the domain of natural\r\nscience comes to this, that the former fits new facts into a scheme of\r\nold conceptions, the latter deduces new conceptions from new facts;\r\nthe one is in its nature dogmatic and intolerant, the other eminently\r\ncritical; the one is conservative, the other always pressing forwards;\r\nthe one inclines to philosophic contemplation, the other to vigorous\r\nand productive investigation. To this must be added one point of\r\ngreat importance; the idealistic view of nature, rejecting causality,\r\nexplains nature from notions of design, and is teleological; ethical\r\nand even theological elements are thus introduced into natural science.\r\n\r\nIt is in this form that the distinction between the idealistic view\r\nrepresented by Braun and the modern inductive morphology presents\r\nitself to us. If it were the task of this history only to record the\r\ndiscovery of new facts, it would be superfluous to allude to these\r\ndifferences here; but then it would also be impossible to estimate\r\nrightly that portion of Braun’s long scientific labours which is at\r\nonce the most original and the most interesting from the historical\r\npoint of view, and which is to be found not so much in his many\r\ndescriptive and monographic works, as in his philosophic efforts in the\r\ndomain of morphology; these moreover deserve our consideration, because\r\nthey carry out Goethe’s half-explained conceptions to their remotest\r\nconsequences, and express in purer form the idealism which lies at the\r\nfoundation of the older nature-philosophy. No botanist since Cesalpino\r\nhas so thoroughly endeavoured to leaven the entire results of inductive\r\ninvestigation with the principles of an idealistic philosophy, and to\r\nexplain them in its light.\r\n\r\nBraun’s philosophical views not only accompany his knowledge of\r\nfacts, but everywhere permeate and colour it; in his writings,\r\ncontributions, and monographs on the most various subjects, facts\r\nare regarded from the point of view of his philosophy. He has given\r\na general view of his philosophical principles and illustrated them\r\nby a vast variety of facts in his famous book, ‘Betrachtungen über\r\ndie Erscheinung der Verjüngung in der Natur, insbesondere in der\r\nLebens-und Bildungsgeschichte der Pflanze’ (1849-50). He himself\r\ndirects attention to the opposition between his own stand-point and the\r\nmodern induction in the tenth page of the preface, where he replies to\r\nthe obvious objection, that his ideas may be regarded as antiquated,\r\nin the words, ‘A more living contemplation of nature, such as is here\r\nattempted, which seeks in natural bodies not merely the operation of\r\ndead forces, but the expression of a living fact, does not lead, as\r\nis supposed, to airy structures of fancy, for it does not pretend to\r\ngain a knowledge of life in nature in any other way than as it is\r\nrevealed in phenomena,’ etc. This thought is still more distinctly\r\nuttered in page 13 of the text; ‘As external nature without mankind\r\npresents to us only the spectacle of a labyrinth without a guide,\r\nso too scientific contemplation, which denies the inner spiritual\r\nprinciple in nature and the intimate connection of nature with the\r\ninforming spirit[50], leads to a chaos of substances and forces, which\r\nare unknown because divorced from spirit, or, to speak more precisely,\r\nto a chaos of nothing but unknown causes, which work together in an\r\ninexplicable manner.’ In a note to this passage he points expressly\r\nto ‘the comfortless character of such an unreal mode of viewing\r\nnature, which must necessarily endeavour to root out everything in\r\nthe conceptions and language of science which appears from its own\r\npoint of view to be anthropopathic,’ and he requires a tender, ethical\r\nelement as essential to botanical investigation. The chief object of\r\nthe volume is to prove that everything in organic life may be resolved\r\ninto rejuvenescence, of which idea no definition is actually given,\r\nthough the whole contents of the book are a search after a definition.\r\nWe may regard the idea of rejuvenescence, as presented by Braun, as an\r\nextension of the idea of metamorphosis, in which extended form it is\r\nadapted to take in even the results of the cell-theory, of the history\r\nof development, and of the modern knowledge of the Cryptogams from the\r\nidealistic point of view. One peculiarity of his mode of expounding\r\nhis views is observed here, as on other occasions, namely, that he\r\ngives no precise and arbitrary definition to a word, for instance, like\r\nrejuvenescence in the present place, and in a later work to the word\r\nindividual, but looks behind the word for a profound or even mysterious\r\nmeaning, which is to be perceived and brought to light by contemplation\r\nof the phenomena. In page 5 he says, ‘Thus we see youth and age appear\r\nalternately in one and the same history of development; we see youth\r\nburst through age, and by growth or transformation step into the middle\r\nof the development. This is the phenomenon of rejuvenescence, which is\r\nrepeated in endless multiplicity in every province of life, but nowhere\r\nappears more clearly expressed or more accessible to investigation than\r\nin the vegetable kingdom. Without rejuvenescence there is no history\r\nof development.’—‘If then we ask for the causes of the phenomena of\r\nrejuvenescence (page 7), we shall indeed allow that nature, into which\r\nspecial life enters in its various manifestations, excites, awakes,\r\nand works by the influences which the years and even the days bring\r\nwith them; but the true and inner cause can only be found in the\r\ndesire after perfection which belongs to every being in its kind, and\r\nurges it to bring the outer world, which is strange to it, more and\r\nmore into complete subjection to itself, and to fashion itself in it\r\nas independently as its specific nature admits.’ Further on he says\r\n(page 17), ‘The impulse or tendency to development in each creature\r\nis likewise no direction of activity impressed from without, but one\r\ngiven from within and working as an inner determination and force\r\nfrom the depth of the inner nature.’ A passage also from page 111 of\r\nhis treatise on polyembryony, published in 1860, may be quoted here;\r\n‘Though the organism, in the process of realising itself, is subject\r\nto physical conditions, yet the proper causes of its morphological and\r\nbiological characteristics do not lie in these conditions; its laws\r\nbelong to a higher stage of development of its being, to a sphere in\r\nwhich the faculty of self-determination is distinctly manifested. If\r\nthis is so, the laws of an organic being appear as tasks imposed, the\r\nfulfilling of which is not absolutely necessary but only in relation\r\nto the attainment of a definite end, as precepts, to which strict\r\nobedience may possibly not be paid.’ To return once more to the idea\r\nof rejuvenescence, we find at page 18 the words, ‘As regards the idea\r\nof rejuvenescence, from the foregoing considerations we draw the\r\nconclusion, that the surrender of growths already accomplished and\r\nthe going back to new beginnings, the commencement of rejuvenescence,\r\nindicate only the outer side of the proceeding, while the essential\r\npart of it is an inner gathering up of forces, a new creating, as it\r\nwere, out of the individual principle of life, a fresh reflecting upon\r\nthe specific task or the gaining renewed hold upon the type which is\r\nto be presented in the outer organism. By this means rejuvenescence\r\nmaintains its fixed relation to development, which can and ought to\r\npresent in gradually attained perfection that only which lies in the\r\nnature of the creature, and is most intimately its own.’ And at the\r\nconclusion of the work (page 347) he says, ‘The way in which the inner\r\nspiritual nature of life is specially manifested in the phenomenon of\r\nrejuvenescence may be defined as reminiscence in the true sense of\r\nthe word, as the power of grasping anew in the phenomenon the inner\r\ndestination of life as contrasted with its daily alienation and decay,\r\nand applying it with renewed strength towards that which is without,’\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThis conception of rejuvenescence is, then, applied to all the\r\nphenomena of life in plants; not only the metamorphosis of leaves, the\r\nformation of shoots and their ramification, and the different modes of\r\ncell-formation, but even palaeontological facts are manifestations of\r\nrejuvenescence, which in the sequel puts off the form of an abstract\r\nidea, and becomes personified into an active personality, as is seen in\r\npage 8 in the expression, ‘activity of rejuvenescence.’\r\n\r\nThe relation of Braun’s views to the question of the constancy of\r\nspecies may to some extent appear doubtful; some utterances of his may\r\nbe interpreted to admit a transmutation of species accomplished in\r\nthe course of ages, while others are opposed to this, and it is the\r\nlatter which appear to be consistent with the idealistic position. We\r\nread, for instance, at page 9, ‘The appearance, as though the like was\r\nalways repeating itself in nature, is suggested when we glance back\r\nfrom our station in time upon the succession of former epochs. Here\r\nwe find the real first beginnings of species and genera, and even of\r\norders and classes in the vegetable and animal kingdoms; we see at the\r\nsame time that more or less thorough transformations are connected\r\nwith the appearance of the higher grades in the organic kingdom, so\r\nthat genera and species of the old world disappear, and new ones step\r\ninto their place. All this change expresses not the mere accident of\r\nconvulsions, which, while they destroy, at the same time prepare new\r\nground for the prosperity of organic nature, but rather definite laws\r\nwhose action pervades all the individual detail of the development\r\nof organic life.’ On the other hand we find at the conclusion of the\r\ntreatise on polyembryony, written a short time before the appearance\r\nof Darwin’s memorable work, a sentence which makes the assumption of\r\na transmutation of species appear very doubtful; it says (page 257),\r\n‘If we are justified in assuming a general organic connection in the\r\nhistory of development in plant-forms, can we imagine that the type of\r\nthe Mosses and of the Ferns has come from the Algae, or _vice versa_,\r\nthat the Alga-form owes its origin to the Mosses and Ferns?’\r\n\r\nThe sentences here quoted to show Braun’s philosophical position\r\nstill give no idea of the way in which the principles embodied in\r\nthem influence the whole manner of presenting the facts in the\r\narrangement of his empirical material, but to give a clear idea of\r\nthis is impossible in so brief a notice as the present. His conception\r\nof his subject is shown still more distinctly in a treatise which\r\nappeared three years later, entitled ‘Das Individuum der Pflanze in\r\nseinem Verhältniss zur Species, Generationsfolge, Generationswechsel\r\nund Generationstheilung der Pflanze’ (1852-3). The definition of\r\nthe word individual is here sought, as that of rejuvenescence was\r\nin the previous work,—a really difficult task, if we consider how\r\nmany meanings have been assigned to this word in the course of time;\r\nin the individuals or atoms of Epicurus, the individuals or monads\r\nof Leibnitz, the atoms of modern chemistry, the speculations of the\r\nschoolmen on the ‘principium individuationis’ as opposed to the reality\r\nwhich they assigned to universal conceptions, and in the customary\r\napplication of the word in every-day language, in which a man or a\r\nsingle tree is called an individual, we have the general views of\r\nvarious centuries, showing how the sense and meaning of old words\r\nbecome changed, not unfrequently into their exact opposites. From\r\nthe nominalist position of modern natural science this is of little\r\nimportance, because this treats words and ideas as mere instruments\r\nfor mutual understanding, and seeks no meaning in either which has\r\nnot been previously and purposely assigned to them. Braun’s mode of\r\nproceeding is quite different; by comparison of very various phenomena\r\nof vegetation, and by examining former views on the subject of the\r\nindividual plant, he seeks to demonstrate a deeper meaning which must\r\nbe connected with the word.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he makes the enquiry into the individual only a thread on\r\nwhich to string his own reflections, in the course of which he once\r\nmore explains the principles of the teleological nature-philosophy,\r\nand points out its opposition to modern science, the latter being\r\ngrievously misrepresented as materialistic, its atoms qualified as\r\ndead, its forces as blind. It would scarcely be guessed from Braun’s\r\naccount that the history of philosophy could point to Bacon, Locke, and\r\nKant, as well as to Aristotle, that even the question of the individual\r\nhad been already handled by the schoolmen. A consideration of the\r\nother point of view would have been all the more profitable, since the\r\nauthor in the beginning of his treatise expresses the opinion that the\r\ndoctrine of the individual belongs to the elements of botany; it might\r\ncertainly be maintained that it is altogether superfluous.\r\n\r\nHis train of thought in search of that which must be called an\r\nindividual in the vegetable kingdom is briefly as follows: In forming a\r\nconception of the plant-individual as the unity of a cycle of formation\r\nor a morphological whole, our chief difficulty lies in the division\r\ninto parts and the divisibility (Getheiltheit und Theilbarkeit) which\r\nare present in the very different stages of the organic structure of\r\nplants. It is requisite therefore to find the middle way between the\r\nmorphological consideration of the individual plant which breaks up\r\nthe whole from above downwards, and the physiological which extends it\r\nin the upward direction beyond all limits. Neither the leaf-bearing\r\nshoots, though they are capable of developing into independent plants,\r\nnor the parts of them, which have the same power, neither the single\r\ncells, nor the granules they contain, and least of all the atoms of\r\ndead matter which are the sport of blind forces, would answer to\r\nthe idea of the individual in plants. We have therefore to decide\r\nwhich member of this many-graded series of potences in the cycle of\r\ndevelopment subordinated to the species deserves by preference the name\r\nof individual (p. 48). A compromise is then made; it is sufficient to\r\nfind a part of the plant which answers above all others to the idea\r\nof the individual, for in this idea there must be two genetic forces,\r\nmultiplicity and unity. He then decides for the shoot or bud. ‘In\r\ncontemplating the plant-stem which is usually branched, especially\r\na tree with its many branches, mere instinctive feeling awakens the\r\nsuspicion that it is not a single being, a single life, to be classed\r\nwith the individual animal or individual man, but that it is a world\r\nof united individuals which spring from one another in a succession of\r\ngenerations,’ etc. He proceeds to show that this conception, arising as\r\nit does from a sound, natural feeling, is also confirmed by scientific\r\nexamination. It appears, however, that many phenomena in the growth\r\nof plants will not fall in well with this instinctive feeling, and\r\nso he says at page 69, ‘We cut the Gordian knot in this way, that\r\nif we have other and sufficient grounds for regarding branches as\r\nindividuals, we come to the determination to let every branch pass for\r\nan individual, however strongly the appearance may be against it.’\r\nThe shoot is therefore the morphological individual in the plant, and\r\nis analogous to the individual animal. It may certainly be objected,\r\nthat we may cut the knot in another way and maintain with Schleiden\r\nthat the cells are the individuals in the vegetable kingdom, if we do\r\nnot actually arrive by the same path at calling each atom, or at the\r\nother end of the scale the whole self-nourishing plant, an individual,\r\nfor about equally strong reasons might be adduced for both one and the\r\nother of these views. It all depends on the point of view we adopt in\r\nsuch speculations, and on the weight we allow to instinctive feeling\r\nin establishing scientific ideas. Braun declares very decidedly in\r\npage 39 against the notion that the invisible ‘individua’ or atoms\r\nof dead matter can be introduced into the consideration of the\r\nplant-individual, as though the plant were a mere concrete of mutually\r\nattracting and repelling atoms. If, he says, we will understand by the\r\nterm individual something absolutely indivisible, this is certainly the\r\nlast resort, but then we shall have no plant-individual. Moreover, no\r\neye has ever seen these atoms; their assumption is a mere hypothesis,\r\nwhich we may confront with the other hypothesis of the continuity and\r\npermeability of matter. The question therefore, he says, at page 39,\r\nis whether we can speak of individuals in plants at all, and this\r\ncoincides with the other question, whether the plant is a mere product\r\nof the activity of matter, and so an unsubstantial appearance in the\r\ngeneral circulation of nature, the offspring of blind agencies, or\r\nwhether it possesses a peculiar and independent existence. The views\r\nof the physiologists, who reject the vital force and explain the\r\nphenomena of life by physical and chemical laws, have robbed life of\r\nits mysterious and most directly operative principle, and pulled down\r\nthe strong wall of separation between organic and inorganic nature.\r\n‘Because physical forces appear to be everywhere confined to matter and\r\nshow in their operation a strict subjection to law, men have ventured\r\nto regard the sum total of natural phenomena as the result of original\r\nmatter working in conjunction with definite powers according to the\r\nlaws of blind necessity, as a natural mechanism moving in endless\r\ncirculation.’ But he objects that the eternally necessary can only be\r\nconceived of as accomplished from all eternity, and thus this physical\r\nview would make all eventuality inconceivable. Further, the purpose of\r\nthe movement of nature must remain an insoluble enigma in this scheme\r\nof blind necessity. ‘The inadequateness of the so-called physical view\r\nof nature as compared with the teleological is therefore most felt in\r\nthe domain of organic nature, where special purpose in the phenomena\r\nof life appears everywhere in greatest distinctness.’ The last remark\r\nis indisputable so long as we maintain either the constancy of species\r\nor a merely internal law of development; the solution of the enigma\r\nwas discovered a few years later in Darwin’s hypothesis, that all\r\nadaptations of organisms are to be explained by the maintenance or\r\nsuppression of varieties, according as they are well or ill provided\r\nwith the means of sustaining the struggle for existence. No other\r\nrefutation or rather explanation of teleology in the science of organic\r\nlife has hitherto been attempted. It has been already pointed out that\r\nsystematic botany, by establishing the fact of affinity, saw itself\r\ncompelled at last to give up the constancy of specific forms in order\r\nto make this fact intelligible, and here we see how the idea of the\r\nadaptation of organisms is found to conflict with causality, unless\r\nwe assume that the forms which arise through variation only maintain\r\nthemselves, if they are sufficiently adapted to the surrounding\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe movement which began with Goethe and the nature-philosophy assumed\r\na clearer form, found its purest expression, and revealed its most\r\nhidden treasures in the writings of Schimper and Alexander Braun; it\r\nwould be superfluous to submit to a detailed review the numerous works\r\nof less important representatives of these views.\r\n\r\nWe turn from this realm of idealistic philosophy and imagination, from\r\nrejuvenescence, the wave-pulse of metamorphosis, the spiral tendency\r\nof growth, and the individuality of plants, to the last chapter of\r\nour history of systematic botany and morphology, where there is less\r\ndogmatism and less poetry, but a firmer ground on which will spring an\r\nunexpected wealth of new discoveries and of deeper insight into the\r\nnature of the vegetable world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMORPHOLOGY AND SYSTEMATIC BOTANY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HISTORY OF\r\n           DEVELOPMENT AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRYPTOGAMS.\r\n\r\n                              1840-1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the years immediately before and after 1840 a new life began to\r\nstir in all parts of botanical research, in anatomy, physiology,\r\nand morphology. Morphology was now specially connected with renewed\r\ninvestigations into the sexuality of plants and into embryology, and\r\nattention was no longer confined to the Phanerogams but was extended to\r\nthe higher and later on to the lower Cryptogams. These researches into\r\nthe history of development first became possible, when von Mohl had\r\nrestored the study of anatomy, and Nägeli had founded and elaborated\r\nthe theory of cell-formation about the year 1845. The success of both\r\nthese enquirers was due to the previous development of the art of\r\nmicroscopy; it was the microscope which revealed the facts on which\r\nthe foundations of the new research were laid, while its promoters at\r\nthe same time started from other philosophical principles than those\r\nwhich had hitherto prevailed among botanists. Investigation by means\r\nof the microscope enforces on the observer the very highest strain\r\nof attention and its concentration on a definite object, while at\r\nthe same time a definite question to be decided by the observation\r\nhas always to be kept before the mind; there are sources of error on\r\nall sides to be avoided, and possible deceptions to be taken into\r\nconsideration; the securing of the facts demands all the powers\r\nwhich specially display the individual character of the observer.\r\nThus serious attention to microscopy was one of the causes which\r\nintroduced the best observers to the practice of inductive enquiry,\r\nand gave them an insight into its nature; and in a few years’ time\r\nwhen the actual results of these investigations began to appear, and\r\nwhen a wholly new world disclosed itself to botanists, especially in\r\nthe Cryptogams, then questions arose on which the dogmatic philosophy\r\nhad not essayed its ancient strength; the facts and the questions\r\nwere new and untouched, and presented themselves to unprejudiced\r\nobservation in a purer form than those, which during the first three\r\ncenturies had been so mixed up with the old philosophy and with the\r\nprinciples of scholasticism. Von Mohl, who only occasionally occupied\r\nhimself with morphological subjects, was a firm adherent of the\r\ninductive method, and was bent on the establishment of individual facts\r\nrather than of general principles; but the founders also of the new\r\nmorphology, Schleiden and Nägeli, started from philosophical points\r\nof view, which, different as they were in the two men, had yet two\r\nthings in common, a demand for severely inductive investigation as\r\nthe foundation of all science, and the rejection of all teleological\r\nmodes of explaining phenomena, in which latter point their opposition\r\nto the idealistic nature-philosophy school was most distinctly\r\nmanifested. They had indeed one very important point of contact with\r\nthis school, the belief in the constancy of organic forms: but this\r\nbelief, not being connected with the Platonic doctrine of ideas,\r\nwas with them only a recognition of every-day observations, and was\r\ntherefore of less fundamental importance, being felt merely as an\r\ninconvenient element in the science. Treating the question in this\r\nway, and influenced by the results of the new researches, they either\r\ninclined to entertain the idea of descent before the appearance of\r\nDarwin’s great work, or gave a ready assent to the principle of the\r\nnew doctrine, though they expressed some doubts respecting matters\r\nof detail. Hofmeister’s researches in morphology and embryology\r\n(‘Vergleichende Untersuchungen,’ 1851) threw an entirely new light on\r\nthe relations of affinity between the great groups in the vegetable\r\nkingdom, and were leading more and more to the view, that there must be\r\nsome special peculiarity in the question of the constancy of organic\r\nforms. But the idea of evolution in the vegetable kingdom was brought\r\nmore distinctly home to men’s minds by palaeontological researches;\r\nSternberg (1820-1838), Brongniart (1828-1837), Goeppert (1837-1845),\r\nand Corda (1845) made the flora of former ages the subject of careful\r\nstudy, and compared fossil plants with living allied forms. Unger\r\nespecially, while advancing the knowledge of the structure of cells and\r\nof vegetable anatomy and physiology, and generally taking a prominent\r\npart in the development of the new botany, applied the results of its\r\ninvestigations to the examination of primeval vegetation, and showed\r\nthe morphological and systematic relations between past and existing\r\nfloras. After twenty years of preliminary study he declared distinctly\r\nin 1852, that the immutability of species is an illusion, that the new\r\nspecies which have made their appearance in geological periods are\r\norganically connected, the younger having arisen from the elder[51]. It\r\nwas shown in the former chapter, how about the same time the leading\r\nrepresentative of idealistic views, Alexander Braun, was driven to the\r\nhypothesis, though in a more indefinite form, of an evolution of the\r\nvegetable kingdom: and in the year that Darwin’s book on the origin\r\nof species appeared, Nägeli (‘Beiträge,’ ii. p. 34) wrote:—‘External\r\nreasons, supplied by the comparison of the floras of successive\r\ngeological periods, and internal reasons given in physiological and\r\nmorphological laws of development and in the variability of the\r\nspecies, leave scarcely a doubt that species have proceeded one from\r\nanother.’\r\n\r\nThough these words might not contain a theory of descent capable\r\nat once of scientific application, yet they show that the latest\r\nresearches and candid appreciation of facts were compelling the most\r\neminent representatives of the botany of the day to give up the\r\nconstancy of forms. At the same time in the genetic morphology which\r\nhad developed itself mainly under Nägeli’s guidance since 1844, and\r\nstill more in embryology, which in Hofmeister’s hands was leading to\r\nresults of the greatest systematic importance, there lay a fruitful\r\nelement destined to correct and enrich Darwin’s doctrine of descent\r\nin one essential point. That doctrine in its original form sought\r\nto show that selection, the result of the struggle for existence,\r\ncombined with perpetual variation was the sole cause of progressive\r\nimprovement in organic forms[52]; but Nägeli, relying on the results\r\nof German morphology, was able as early as 1865 to point out that this\r\nexplanation was not satisfactory, because it leaves unnoticed certain\r\nmorphological relations, especially between the large divisions of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, which scarcely seem explainable by mere selection\r\nin breeding. While Nägeli allowed that Darwin’s principle of selection\r\nwas well adapted to explain fully the adaptation of organisms to their\r\nenvironment and the suitableness and physiological peculiarities\r\nof their structure, he pointed out that in the nature of plants\r\nthemselves there are intimations of laws of variation, which lead to a\r\nperfecting of organic forms and to their progressive differentiation,\r\nindependently of the struggle for existence and of natural selection;\r\nthe importance of this result of morphological research has since been\r\nrecognised by Darwin. Thus Nägeli supplied what was wanting in the\r\ntheory of descent and gave it the form, in which it is adequate to\r\nexplain the problem already recognised by the systematists of the old\r\npersuasion, namely, how it is possible for the morphological affinity\r\nof species in the system to be in so high a degree independent of their\r\nphysiological adaptation to their environment.\r\n\r\nThe modern teaching on vegetable cells, modern anatomy, and morphology,\r\nand the improved form of the theory of selection are the product of\r\ninductive enquiry since 1840, a product, the full importance of which\r\nwill be described in the following portions of our history. At present\r\nwe have to deal only with morphological and systematic results, and\r\ntherefore with a part only of the abundant labours of the botanists\r\nwho will be noticed in this chapter; the remainder will be reserved\r\nfor succeeding books, which contain the history of the anatomy and\r\nphysiology of plants.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the characteristic features of this period of botany, that\r\nmorphology enters into the closest connection with the doctrine of the\r\ncell, with anatomy and embryology, and that researches, especially\r\ninto the process of fecundation and the formation of the embryo, form\r\nto some extent the central point of morphological and systematic\r\ninvestigations. A strict separation of these various enquiries, which\r\nare all ultimately applicable to the purposes of systematic botany, can\r\ntherefore scarcely be maintained, and least of all in dealing with the\r\nlower Cryptogams.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe condition of botanical literature about the year 1840 was highly\r\nunsatisfactory; it is true that eminent service was rendered in\r\nthe several domains of systematic botany, morphology, anatomy, and\r\nphysiology, and a number of von Mohl’s best works were produced in\r\nthis period; Meyen also, Dutrochet, Ludolph Treviranus and others were\r\ncultivating vegetable anatomy and physiology, and it has been already\r\nstated that good and noticeable work was done in the previous years in\r\nmorphology and systematic botany. But there was no one to put together,\r\nto criticise and apply the knowledge which had been accumulated in\r\nall parts of the science; no one really knew what a wealth there was\r\nat that time of important facts; least of all was it possible to form\r\na judgment on the matter from the text-books of the period, which\r\nwere deficient in ideas and facts, and crammed with a superfluous\r\nterminology; their mode of treating their subject was trivial and\r\ntasteless, and whatever was specially worth knowing and important to\r\nthe student they did not contain. Those who undertook really scientific\r\nenquiries separated themselves from those who dealt with botany after\r\nthe old schematism of the Linnaean school; but botanical instruction,\r\nthe propagation of knowledge, was almost everywhere in the hands of\r\nthis school, though it was the one least fitted for the task; and thus\r\na mass of lifeless phrases was the instruction offered to the majority\r\nof students under the name of botany, with the inevitable effect of\r\nrepelling the more gifted natures from the study. This was the evil\r\nresult of the old and foolish notion, that the sole or chief business\r\nof every botanist is to trifle away time in plant-collecting in wood\r\nand meadow and in rummaging in herbaria,—proceedings which could\r\ndo no good to systematic botany even as understood by the Linnaean\r\nschool. Even the better sort lost the sense for higher knowledge\r\nwhile occupying themselves in this way with the vegetable world; the\r\npowers of the mind could not fail after a time to deteriorate, and\r\nevery text-book of the period on every page supplies proof of this\r\ndeterioration.\r\n\r\nBut such a condition of things is dangerous for every science; of what\r\nprofit is it, that single men of superior merit advance this or that\r\npart of the science when a connected view of the whole is wanting,\r\nand the beginner has no opportunity of studying the best things in\r\ntheir mutual relations. However, the right man was found at the right\r\nmoment to rouse easy indolence from its torpor, and to show his\r\ncontemporaries, not in Germany only but in all countries where botany\r\nwas studied, that no progress was possible in this way. This man was\r\nMATTHIAS JACOB SCHLEIDEN, born at Hamburg in 1804, and for many years\r\nProfessor in Jena. Endowed with somewhat too great love of combat, and\r\narmed with a pen regardless of the wounds it inflicted, ready to strike\r\nat any moment, and very prone to exaggeration, Schleiden was just the\r\nman needed in the state in which botany then was. His first appearance\r\non the scene was greeted with joy by the most eminent among those who\r\nafterwards contributed to the real advance of the science, though their\r\npaths it is true diverged considerably at a later period, when the time\r\nof reconstruction was come. If we were to estimate Schleiden’s merit\r\nonly by the facts which he discovered, we should scarcely place him\r\nabove the level of ordinarily good botanists; we should have to reckon\r\nup a list of good monographs, numerous refutations of ancient errors\r\nand the like; the most important of the theories which he proposed, and\r\nover which vigorous war was waged among botanists during many years,\r\nhave long since been set aside. His true historical importance has\r\nbeen already intimated; his great merit as a botanist is due not to\r\nwhat he did as an original investigator, but to the impulse he gave\r\nto investigation, to the aim and object which he set up for himself\r\nand others, and opposed in its greatness to the petty character of the\r\ntext-books. He smoothed the way for those who could and would do really\r\ngreat service; he created, so to speak, for the first time an audience\r\nfor scientific botany capable of distinguishing scientific work from\r\nfrivolous dilettanteism. Whoever wished from this time forward to take\r\npart in the discussion of botanical subjects must address all his\r\npowers to the task, for he would be judged by another standard than had\r\nhitherto prevailed.\r\n\r\nSchleiden, who had commenced his botanical labours with some important\r\nresearches in anatomy and the history of development, the most valuable\r\nof which in matter and form was an enquiry into the development of\r\nthe ovule before fertilisation (1837), composed also a comprehensive\r\ntext-book of general botany, which appeared first in 1842-3, and\r\nin much improved editions in 1845 and 1846, and in two subsequent\r\nyears. The difference between this and all previous text-books is the\r\ndifference between day and night; in the one, an indolent carelessness\r\nand an absence of ideas; in the other, a fulness of life and thought,\r\ncalculated to influence young minds all the more, because it was in\r\nmany respects incomplete and still in a state of fermentation. On\r\nevery page of this remarkable work, by the side of facts really worth\r\nknowing, the student found interesting reflections, a lively and\r\ngenerally coarse polemic, and praise and blame of others. It was not\r\na book to be studied quietly and comfortably, but one that excited\r\nthe reader everywhere to take a side for or against, and to seek for\r\nfurther instruction.\r\n\r\nThe work is generally quoted as ‘Grundzüge der wissenschaftlichen\r\nBotanik,’ but its chief title is ‘Die Botanik als inductive\r\nWissenschaft,’ which indicates the point on which Schleiden laid most\r\nstress. His great object was to place the study, which had been so\r\ndisfigured in the text-books as scarcely to wear the semblance of\r\na natural science, on the same footing with physics and chemistry,\r\nin which the spirit of genuine inductive enquiry into nature had\r\nalready asserted itself in opposition to the nature-philosophy of\r\nthe immediately preceding years. It may seem strange to us now to\r\nsee a text-book of botany introduced by a formal essay, 131 pages\r\nlong, on the inductive method of investigation as opposed to dogmatic\r\nphilosophy, and to find the principles of induction set forth again\r\nand again in connection with a great variety of subjects in the\r\nbook itself. Many objections may be raised to the contents of this\r\nintroduction; it may be said that many philosophical dicta are\r\nmisunderstood in it; that Schleiden himself has frequently offended\r\nagainst the rules there laid down, for instance, when he substitutes\r\na formative impulse (nisus formativus) for the vital force which he\r\nrejects, which is only introducing vital force again under another\r\nname; that it is superfluous to present the history of development\r\nas a ‘maxim’ in Kant’s use of the word, instead of showing that the\r\nhistory of development enters naturally and of itself into inductive\r\ninvestigation, and so on. All this will not lessen the historical\r\nimportance of this philosophic introduction; the traditional way in\r\nwhich descriptive botany was at that time presented to the student was\r\nso thoroughly dogmatic and scholastic, trivial and uncritical, that it\r\nwas necessary to impress upon him in many words, that this is not the\r\nmethod of true investigation of nature.\r\n\r\nPassing on to the more special problems of botanical enquiry, Schleiden\r\nnext dwells on the history of development as the foundation of all\r\ninsight into morphology, though he overshot the mark when he rejected\r\nas unfruitful the simple comparative method, which had produced\r\nconsiderable results in the hands of De Candolle, and was virtually the\r\nfruitful element in the doctrine of phyllotaxis of Schimper and Braun.\r\nStill he took an active part himself in the study of development in\r\nplants, and gave special prominence to embryology; he also discussed\r\nthe doctrine of metamorphosis from the point of view of the history\r\nof development, and pointed to Caspar Friedrich Wolff’s treatment of\r\nthat subject as much clearer than that which had been introduced by\r\nGoethe. Finally, Schleiden’s mode of dealing with the natural system\r\nmust be reckoned among the good services which he rendered to method;\r\nnot because his classification of the vegetable kingdom presents any\r\nspecially interesting features or brought to light any new affinities,\r\nbut because we see an attempt made for the first time to give detailed\r\ncharacters drawn from morphology and the history of development to the\r\nprimary divisions, and because by this means the positive and distinct\r\nnature of the Cryptogams was from the first clearly brought out. The\r\nold way of treating morphology, as though there were only Phanerogams\r\nin the world, and then having recourse to unmeaning negatives in\r\ndealing with the Cryptogams, was thus set aside, much to the profit\r\nof the immediate future, which directed its attention specially to the\r\nCryptogams.\r\n\r\nSchleiden however did not succeed in securing firm ground for the\r\nmorphology of the Cryptogams as founded on the history of their\r\ndevelopment. His investigations into the morphology of the Phanerogams\r\nwere more successful. His theory of the flower and fruit is an\r\nadmirable performance for the time, even though we abandon his view of\r\nthe stalk nature of placentas and some other notions, as we obviously\r\nmust. As Robert Brown founded the history of the development of the\r\novule, so Schleiden founded that of the flower, and his example\r\ninfluenced other botanists. Soon investigations into the genesis of\r\nthe flower was one of the chief occupations of morphologists, and the\r\nresults of enquiry into development proved to be of great value for the\r\nsystematic arrangement of the Phanerogams, especially when more exact\r\nattention was paid to the sequence of development in the organs of an\r\ninflorescence, to abortion, doubling and branching of the stamens, and\r\nto the like matters. Duchartre, Wigand, Gelesnoff and many others,\r\nwere soon working in the same direction with great success. Payer\r\ndeserves special mention for his enormous perseverance in examining the\r\ndevelopment of the flower in all the more important families in his\r\n‘Organogénie de la fleur,’ 1857, and thus producing a standard work,\r\ndistinguished alike for the certainty of the observations, the simple\r\nunbiassed interpretation of the things observed, and the beauty and\r\nabundance of the figures—a work which became more important every year\r\nfor the morphology of the flower.\r\n\r\nSchleiden’s text-book was the first of its kind that supplied the\r\nstudent with really good figures based on careful observations. With\r\nall its many and obvious defects it had one merit which cannot be\r\nrated too highly; its appearance at once put botany on the footing\r\nof a natural science in the modern sense of the word, and placed it\r\nupon a higher platform, extending its horizon by raising its point of\r\nview. Botany appeared all at once as a science rich in subject-matter;\r\nSchleiden had not only himself made many investigations and broached\r\nnew theories, but he everywhere drew attention to what was already\r\nbefore the world and was important; for it is not sufficient as regards\r\nthe literature of a science that there should be good investigators; it\r\nis as necessary that the scientific public, and especially the rising\r\ngeneration of professed students, should be well and sufficiently\r\ninstructed in the art of distinguishing important from unimportant\r\ncontributions. It must be distinctly affirmed in this place, that if\r\nSchleiden’s theory of cell-formation, his strange notion about the\r\nembryology of Phanerogams and the like were very quickly shown to be\r\nuntenable, this does not in the least affect the great historical\r\nimportance which his writings possess in the sense here indicated.\r\n\r\nThat others besides Schleiden in the period following 1840 felt\r\nstrongly, that botany must thenceforward give up its complacent resting\r\nin the old ideas, was shown among other things by the addition at this\r\ntime of new periodicals to the old journal ‘Flora.’ The ‘Botanische\r\nZeitung’ was founded by von Mohl and Schlechtendal in 1843, and the\r\n‘Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Botanik’ by Schleiden and Nägeli.\r\nThe latter, however, only lived three years, from 1844 to 1846, and was\r\nfilled almost entirely with Nägeli’s contributions. Both publications\r\nexpressly set themselves the task of representing the new aims in the\r\nscience. The immediate consequence was that ‘Flora’ braced up its\r\nenergies, and endeavoured to do more justice to the modern spirit;\r\nexcellent notices of botanical works now appeared in it under the\r\nexclusive management of Fürnrohr.\r\n\r\nSchleiden’s productivity in the higher sense of the word expended\r\nitself in his labours on the elements of scientific botany. His\r\nlater somewhat discursive writings exerted no great influence on the\r\nfurther development of the science. The ideal which he had set up for\r\nscientific botany and had sketched in its larger outlines, could only\r\nbe realised by the most persevering labour not of one man only, but of\r\nwhole generations of observers and thinkers, nor did he apply himself\r\nwith painful unremitting industry to the attainment of this exalted aim.\r\n\r\nSoon after Schleiden’s ‘Grundzüge’ first stirred the scientific world,\r\na man of a very different character of mind began to address himself\r\nto the great task. This was CARL NÄGELI, whose researches from this\r\ntime onwards laid the foundations of knowledge in every department of\r\nbotany. He showed what points were the most immediately attainable, and\r\naided in perfecting the inductive method of enquiry and in advancing\r\nthe study of the history of development. He did not make discoveries\r\nhere and there by desultory efforts, but worked with earnest endurance\r\nat every question which he took up till he had arrived at a positive\r\nresult; and this was almost always an enlargement of previous\r\nknowledge, and a new foundation on which others might build, and a\r\ncopious literature be developed.\r\n\r\nNägeli like others felt the necessity of first determining his position\r\nwith respect to the philosophical principles of the investigation of\r\nnature, but he did not proceed to give a general exposition of the\r\ninductive method as opposed to the dogmatism of the idealistic school.\r\nHe went straight to the application of the laws of induction to the\r\nmost general problems of organic nature, and specially of vegetation.\r\nIt is easy to say that the task of natural science is simply to deduce\r\nconceptions and laws from the facts of experience by aid of exact\r\nobservation. Many considerations present themselves as soon as the\r\nattempt is made to satisfy this demand; for it is not enough merely to\r\naccumulate individual facts, the point to which the inductive enquiry\r\nis to lead must be kept constantly and clearly before the mind. Nägeli\r\ninsisted that it is only in this way that facts and observations\r\nhave any scientific value; that the one important thing is to make\r\nevery single conception obtained by induction find its place in the\r\nscheme of all the rest of our knowledge. With greater consistency of\r\nreasoning than Schleiden, and in entire accordance with the nominalist\r\nview of genuine investigation of nature in its sternest opposition to\r\nthe idealistic school, Nägeli’s first principle is not only to deduce\r\nconceptions from the observation of phenomena, to classify them and\r\nestablish their subordination, but to treat these conceptions as mere\r\nsubjective products of the understanding and employ them as instruments\r\nof thought and communication, and to be always ready to modify them\r\nas soon as inductive enquiry renders such modification necessary.\r\nTill this happens, the conception once laid down and connected with\r\na word is to be strictly adhered to, and every arbitrary change or\r\nconfusion with another conception is strictly forbidden. Since in\r\nnature everything is in movement, and every phenomenon is transitory,\r\npresenting itself to us in organic life especially as the history of\r\ndevelopment, all due regard must be paid to this condition of constant\r\nmotility in forming scientific conceptions. The history of development\r\nis not merely to be treated generally as one of various means of\r\ninvestigation, but as identical with investigation into organic nature.\r\nThese views are expressed in Nägeli’s detailed observations on method\r\nin the first and second volume of the journal which he brought out in\r\nconjunction with Schleiden in 1844 and 1855, where the chief hindrance\r\nto his carrying them out fully and consistently is also to be found;\r\nfor, like all his contemporaries, Nägeli believed at that time in the\r\nconstancy of species, and consistently with this view he looked upon\r\nthe natural system as a framework of conceptions, though these do not\r\ntake the form of Platonic ideas with him as with the systematists of\r\nthe idealistic school. It is equally consistent with his philosophical\r\nposition, which refused to regard a change in our conceptions as a\r\nchange in things themselves, that ‘the idea of metamorphosis’ in the\r\nsense of Goethe and Alexander Braun disappears in Nägeli from the field\r\nof scientific observation. It has been shown in the previous chapter\r\nthat what Goethe called the normal or ascending metamorphosis has\r\nno scientific meaning unless species are supposed to be variable. It\r\nappeared moreover that if the Cryptogams are made the chief subjects\r\nof investigation, as Nägeli made them, the so-called metamorphosis of\r\nthe leaves is a phenomenon of secondary importance, and only attains\r\nto its full importance in the Phanerogams. If Schleiden, illogically\r\nfrom his point of view, conceived of metamorphosis as the principle\r\nof development, Nägeli on the contrary scarcely employed the word. He\r\nregarded the history of development as the law of growth of the organs,\r\nand, in accordance with the theory of the constancy of species, the\r\nlaw of growth of every species and every organ was invariable in the\r\nsame sense in which we apply the term to natural laws in physics and\r\nchemistry. In a word, Nägeli’s considerations on the ‘present task of\r\nnatural history’ in the work above cited, are not only logically and\r\nentirely consistent on the principles of the inductive method, but they\r\nare also consistent where others have been misled by the theory of the\r\nconstancy of species into illogical conclusions.\r\n\r\nNägeli set himself in earnest to meet the demands of inductive\r\nenquiry, such as he had himself described them. It will be shown\r\nmore in detail in the history of phytotomy, how he satisfied these\r\ndemands in his refutation of Schleiden’s doctrine of the cell, and\r\nin the establishment of his own, and at a later time in the framing\r\nof his theory of molecular structure and of the growth of organised\r\nbodies, and how he made these investigations true models of genuine\r\ninductive enquiry. Here we are concerned only with what he effected\r\nin this way for morphology and systematic botany. In this field of\r\nresearch he introduced two innovations of the profoundest importance,\r\nwhich affected both the aim and method of enquiry for some years. He\r\nconnected his own morphological investigations, as far as possible,\r\nwith the lower Cryptogams, extending them afterwards to the higher\r\nCryptogams and to the Phanerogams; that is, he proceeded from simple\r\nand plain facts to the more difficult, thus not only introducing the\r\nCryptogams into the field of systematic investigation, but making\r\nthem its starting-point. In this way morphology not only secured a\r\nfoundation in exact historical development, but it assumed a different\r\naspect, inasmuch as the morphological ideas hitherto drawn from\r\nthe Phanerogams were now examined by the light of the history of\r\ndevelopment in the Cryptogams. This was one innovation; the second,\r\nclosely connected with it, was the way in which Nägeli made the new\r\ndoctrine of the cell the starting-point of morphology. Both the first\r\ncommencement of organs and their further growth were carried back to\r\nthe formation of the separate cells; and the remarkable result was to\r\nshow, that in the Cryptogams especially, whose growth is intimately\r\nconnected with cell-division, precise conformity to law obtains in the\r\nsuccession and direction of the dividing walls, and that the origin and\r\nfurther growth of every organ is effected by cells of an absolutely\r\nfixed derivation. The most remarkable thing was, that every stem and\r\nbranch, every leaf or other organ has a single cell at its apex, and\r\nthat all succeeding cells are formed by division of this one cell\r\naccording to fixed laws, so that the origin of all cell-tissue can be\r\ntraced back to an apical cell; and as early as the years 1845 and 1846\r\nNägeli described in the ‘Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Botanik’\r\nthe three main forms, according to which the segmentation of an apical\r\ncell proceeds, namely, in one, two, and three rows (Delesseria,\r\nEchinomitrium, Phascum, Jungermannia, Moss-leaves). In this way the\r\nseparate points in the history of growth in the Cryptogams were brought\r\nout with unusual clearness and decision; but on the other hand, Nägeli\r\nshowed in 1844 in the case of a genus of Algae (Caulerpa) that the\r\ngrowth of a plant may show the usual morphological differentiation\r\ninto axis, leaf, and root, when the propagative cell undergoes no\r\ncell-divisions in the process of development and further growth,\r\nand similar conditions were for the first time demonstrated in 1847\r\nin Valonia, Udotea, and Acetabularia. Beside other results it was\r\nestablished by these facts, that morphological differentiation during\r\ngrowth must not be regarded as an effect of cell-divisions, and from\r\nsuch cases as these the conception of the cell experienced a notable\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Nägeli was not satisfied with seeking instructive examples\r\nfor general morphological axioms in the lower Cryptogams; he devoted\r\nspecial study to the Algae for systematic and descriptive purposes;\r\nand his ‘Neuen Algensysteme,’ which appeared in 1847, and ‘Gattungen\r\neinzelliger Algen,’ of 1849, were the first successful attempts to\r\nsubstitute serious investigation for the mere zeal of the collector in\r\nthis part of the vegetable kingdom, which had not indeed been hitherto\r\nneglected, but had not been systematically worked since the time of\r\nVaucher. In the same spirit Alexander Braun also in his ‘Verjüngung’\r\ncontributed a rich material of new observations on the mode of life\r\nof the Algae and the morphological conditions connected with it, and\r\nhis labours were followed in the succeeding years by the important\r\nresearches of Thuret, Pringsheim, De Bary, and others, to which we\r\nshall recur in a later portion of this history.\r\n\r\nBut before the examination of the Algae, and soon after of the Fungi\r\nalso, led to such great results, the systematic botany of the higher\r\nplants underwent important changes through the methodical study of\r\nthe embryology of the Muscineae and Vascular Cryptogams. These groups\r\nhad been frequently and carefully examined by good observers since\r\nthe last century, and the systematists, without penetrating deeply\r\ninto the peculiarities of their organisation, had brought the species\r\nand genera, the families and even the higher divisions into tolerable\r\norder. Comprehensive and methodically arranged catalogues of these\r\nplants had been formed, and attempts had been made to explain their\r\nmorphology by that of the Phanerogams; Schmidel[53] published valuable\r\nobservations on the Liverworts in the year 1750, Hedwig especially\r\non the Mosses in 1782; these works were followed by Mirbel’s thorough\r\nexamination of Marchantia in 1835, by Bischoff’s of Marchantieae and\r\nRiccieae, by Schimper’s study of the Mosses in 1850, and by Lantzius\r\nBeninga’s[54] contributions to the knowledge of the structure of\r\nthe moss-capsule in 1847. The organisation, and to some extent the\r\ngermination, of the Vascular Cryptogams had become better known since\r\n1828 through Bischoff’s[55] researches; Unger had as early as 1837\r\ndescribed the spermatozoids in the antheridia of various Mosses, Nägeli\r\nhad discovered them on an organ of the Ferns which had up to that time\r\nbeen taken for the cotyledonary leaf of these plants, and on the same\r\npart of the plant Suminski in 1848 observed the female sexual organs\r\nand the entrance of the spermatozoids into them. The history of the\r\ngermination of the Rhizocarps, from which Schleiden thought that he\r\nhad proved his erroneous theory of fertilisation with more than usual\r\ncertainty, had been examined some years before by Nägeli, and also by\r\nMettenius, in great detail; here too Nägeli detected the spermatozoids.\r\nThus important fragments of the life and organisation of these plants\r\nhad been described up to the year 1848, but until they were more fully\r\nunderstood and connected together they had but little scientific value,\r\nthe one fact perhaps excepted, that fertilisation in the Cryptogams\r\nas in animals was effected by spermatozoids. A perfect insight into\r\nthe embryological conditions in question could only be obtained when\r\nthe embryology of the Phanerogams especially had been cleared up, for\r\naccording to Schleiden’s theory, which made the pollen-tube enter the\r\nembryo-sac in the ovule and develop into the embryo, the ovule was no\r\nlonger to be regarded as a female sexual organ, but only as a place of\r\nincubation for the embryo, which was thus really produced asexually.\r\nThis important question was set at rest by WILHELM HOFMEISTER’S work,\r\n‘Die Entstehung des Embryos der Phanerogamen,’ which appeared in 1849.\r\nIn this work, and in a series of subsequent treatises, he showed that\r\nthe egg-cell is formed in the embryo-sac before fertilisation, and that\r\nit is this which is excited to further development by the appearance\r\nof the pollen-tube, and produces the embryo. Hofmeister had observed\r\nthe organisation of the ovule, the nature of the embryo-sac and of\r\nthe pollen-grain, and the formation of the embryo from the fertilised\r\negg-cell step by step and cell by cell, and his account of these\r\nprocesses was aided by the light which Nägeli’s theory of the cell,\r\nand his reference of all processes of development to the processes of\r\ncell-formation, had thrown upon the history of development. He went\r\non to apply the same method to the study of the embryology of the\r\nMuscineae and the Vascular Cryptogams, and followed the development\r\nof the sexual organs cell by cell in a large number of species; he\r\nobserved the origination of the egg-cell which was to be subsequently\r\nfertilised, and the formation of spermatozoids, and above all he\r\nshowed the divisions which take place in the fertilised egg-cell,\r\nand the relation of its segments to the further growth of the sexual\r\nproduct in course of formation. The whole course of development in the\r\nMuscineae and Vascular Cryptogams displayed a return twice repeated to\r\nthe single cell as the starting-point in each case of a new phase of\r\ndevelopment; the true relation between the asexually produced spore and\r\nits germ-product on the one side, and the sexually generated embryo on\r\nthe other, and their significance in the history of development, were\r\nbrought out clearly by Hofmeister’s investigation, while the exactness\r\nof his method rendered lengthy discussions on the subject unnecessary.\r\nWith these embryological processes, especially those of the Rhizocarps\r\nand Selaginellae, in which the presence of two kinds of spores was\r\nnow for the first time correctly interpreted, Hofmeister compared the\r\nembryology of the Conifers, and by their aid that of the Angiosperms\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThe results of the investigations published in the ‘Vergleichende\r\nUntersuchungen’ in 1849 and 1851 were magnificent beyond all that has\r\nbeen achieved before or since in the domain of descriptive botany;\r\nthe merit of the many valuable particulars, shedding new light on\r\nthe most diverse problems of the cell-theory and of morphology, was\r\nlost in the splendour of the total result, which the perspicuity of\r\neach separate description revealed to the reader before he came to\r\nthe conclusion of the work, and there a few words in plain and simple\r\nstyle gave a summary of the whole. Briefly to describe this result\r\nin all its importance for botanical science is a difficult task; the\r\nidea of what is meant by the development of a plant was suddenly and\r\ncompletely changed; the intimate connection between such different\r\norganisms as the Liverworts, the Mosses, the Ferns, the Equisetaceae,\r\nthe Rhizocarps, the Selaginellae, the Conifers, the Monocotyledons,\r\nand Dicotyledons could now be surveyed in all its relations with\r\na distinctness never before attained. Alternation of generations,\r\nlately shown to exist though in quite different forms in the animal\r\nkingdom, was proved to be the highest law of development, and to\r\nreign according to a simple scheme throughout the whole long series\r\nof these extremely different plants. It appeared most clearly in the\r\nFerns and Mosses, though at the same time with a certain difference in\r\neach; in the Ferns and allied Cryptogams a small inconspicuous body\r\ngrows out of the asexually produced spore, and immediately produces\r\nthe sexual organs; from the fertilisation of these organs proceeds\r\nthe root-bearing and leafy stem of the Fern, which in its turn again\r\nproduces only asexual spores. In the Muscineae, on the other hand, a\r\nmuch differentiated and usually long-lived plant is developed from the\r\nspore, and this plant proceeds again after some time to form sexual\r\norgans, the product of which is the so-called Moss-plant. The first\r\ngeneration that arose from the spore, the sexual, is in the Muscineae\r\nthe vegetative plant, while in the Ferns and their allies the whole\r\nfulness of vital activity and of morphological differentiation is\r\nunfolded in the second generation which is sexually produced. Here\r\nall was at once clear and obvious: but Hofmeister’s researches also\r\nshowed that the same scheme of development holds good in the Rhizocarps\r\nand Selaginellae where two kinds of spores are formed; and it appeared\r\nplainly from their case that the recognition of the true relation\r\nbetween the production of spores and sexual organs is the guide to the\r\nmorphological interpretation. When the processes in the large female\r\nspore of the most perfect of the Cryptogams was known, the formation\r\nof the seeds in the Conifers was at once understood; the embryo-sac in\r\nthese answered to this large spore, while the endosperm represented\r\nthe prothallium, and the pollen-grain the microspore; the last trace\r\nof alternation of generations, so obvious in the Ferns and Mosses, was\r\nseen in the formation of the seed in the Phanerogams. The changes,\r\nwhich the alternation of generations passes through from the Muscineae\r\nupwards to the Phanerogams, were, if possible, still more surprising\r\nthan the alternation of generations itself.\r\n\r\nThe reader of Hofmeister’s ‘Vergleichende Untersuchungen’ was presented\r\nwith a picture of genetic affinity between Cryptogams and Phanerogams,\r\nwhich could not be reconciled with the then reigning belief in the\r\nconstancy of species. He was invited to recognise a connection\r\nof development which made the most different things appear to be\r\nclosely united together, the simplest Moss with Palms, Conifers, and\r\nangiospermous trees, and which was incompatible with the theory of\r\noriginal types. The assumption that every natural group represents an\r\nidea was here quite out of place; the notion entertained up to that\r\ntime of what was really meant by the natural system had to be entirely\r\naltered; it could as little pass for a body of Platonic ideas as for a\r\nmere framework of conceptions. But the effect of the work was great in\r\nrespect to the system also; the Cryptogams were now the most important\r\nobjects in the study of morphology; the Muscineae were the standard by\r\nwhich the lower Cryptogams must be tried, the Ferns were the measure\r\nfor the Phanerogams. Embryology was the thread which guided the\r\nobserver through the labyrinth of comparative and genetic morphology;\r\nmetamorphosis now received its true meaning, when every organ could\r\nbe referred back to its parent-form, the staminal and carpellary\r\nleaves of the Phanerogams, for example, to the spore-bearing leaves\r\nof the Vascular Cryptogams. That which Häckel, after the appearance\r\nof Darwin’s book, called the phylogenetic method, Hofmeister had\r\nlong before actually carried out, and with magnificent success. When\r\nDarwin’s theory was given to the world eight years after Hofmeister’s\r\ninvestigations, the relations of affinity between the great divisions\r\nof the vegetable kingdom were so well established and so patent, that\r\nthe theory of descent had only to accept what genetic morphology had\r\nactually brought to view.\r\n\r\nSo gorgeous a picture as Hofmeister had designed of the genetic\r\nconnection of the vegetable kingdom, except the Thallophytes, could\r\nnot possibly be completely perfect and correct in all its separate\r\nfeatures; there were still many gaps to fill up and particular\r\nobservations to correct. Hofmeister himself continued his labours; the\r\nremarkable genera Isoetes and Botrychium were in the following years\r\nmore carefully studied by himself, the fertilisation and embryology of\r\nthe Equisetaceae by himself and Milde, and those of Ophioglossum by\r\nMettenius, and all were fitted into their place in the system. To the\r\npresent day it is always a profitable task to submit the different\r\nforms of the Muscineae, the Vascular Cryptogams, and the Gymnosperms\r\nto exact investigation in order to ascertain all the details in the\r\nprocess of development in these plants, the formation of the embryo,\r\nthe succession of cells at the apex, the first appearance and further\r\ngrowth of the lateral organs; and the more careful the observation, the\r\nmore clearly even to its farthest results does the correctness of the\r\nalternation of generations asserted by Hofmeister everywhere appear. It\r\ndoes not fall within the limit of this history to pursue the subject\r\nfurther, and to show how the doctrine of alternation of generations\r\nand the knowledge of the morphology of the Cryptogams were further\r\nadvanced by later and distinguished researches, such as those of Cramer\r\non the Equisetaceae, of Pringsheim on Salvinia (1862), of Nägeli and\r\nLeitgeb on the formation of roots in the Cryptogams, of Hanstein on the\r\ngermination of the Rhizocarps, and of others.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHALLOPHYTES.\r\n\r\nThe method of investigation which starts from the first steps towards\r\nthe formation of the embryo before and after fertilisation, and\r\nfollows the advancing segmentation and growth through all the stages\r\nof development up to the final completion of the embryo-plant, has\r\nled since 1850 in the case of the Muscineae, Vascular Cryptogams, and\r\nPhanerogams to great certainty in the morphological explanation of\r\nthe organs, while the determination of affinities has ceased to be\r\narbitrary and insecure; the way was now known which would lead to the\r\ndesired end, whenever it was sought to establish the affinities of a\r\ngenus of Cryptogams or of the larger groups of Phanerogams; the day\r\nof ingenious guessing and trying was over; the only plan was patient\r\ninvestigation, and this always yielded a result of lasting value.\r\n\r\nThe case was quite different with the Thallophytes still in 1850;\r\nwhat was certainly known about them only showed how uncertain the\r\nrest was; the Algae, Fungi, and Lichens presented a chaotic mass of\r\nobscure forms in contrast with the well-ordered knowledge of the\r\nMuscineae and Vascular plants. In the Mosses and Ferns the series of\r\ndevelopments within the limits of the species was so set forth in its\r\nseveral stages, that all the important points in the advancing growth\r\nwere clearly ascertained, while the alternation of generations at once\r\nsharply distinguished and connected together the chief sections in the\r\ndevelopment; on the other hand the development of the Algae and Fungi\r\nseemed to break up into a disorderly and motley throng of forms that\r\nappeared and disappeared, and it seemed scarcely possible to discover\r\ntheir regular genetic connection. Here the important point was to\r\ndetermine which of the known forms belonged to one and the same cycle\r\nof development, for these plants go back at the most various stages of\r\ndevelopment to the segregation of single cells, which are the beginning\r\nof a new development either repeating or carrying on the old one. The\r\nbeginnings of the most different species of Algae lay mixed up together\r\nin the same drop of water, those of quite different Fungi grew together\r\nand even upon one another on the same substratum; in the Lichens,\r\nFungus and Alga were united together. Such was the case with the small\r\nand microscopic species; the large Seaweeds, the Mushrooms, and the\r\nlarge Lichens were easier to distinguish specifically, but less if\r\npossible was known of their development than of that of the microscopic\r\nThallophytes.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the knowledge of individual forms in these organisms had\r\nbeen considerably extended before 1850. Collectors and amateurs, intent\r\nonly on determining what is immediately presented to the eye and making\r\nlittle enquiry into origin and affinities, were indefatigable in adding\r\nto their collections, and made catalogues and proposed various systems\r\nfounded on external marks taken at pleasure. The names of species were\r\ncounted by thousands, their characters filled thick volumes and the\r\nfigures large folios; the abundance of forms in the Thallophytes proved\r\nto be so great that many botanists devoted their whole attention to\r\nthem, many collected and described only the Algae, others only the\r\nFungi and Lichens. It is true that a deeper insight into the connection\r\nof these forms of life with one another and with other plants was not\r\nto be obtained in this way; still an empirical basis was formed for\r\na knowledge of the Cryptogams, such as had been established for the\r\nPhanerogams by the herbals of the 17th century. All forms open to\r\nobservation were named and arranged in one way or another; and there\r\nwas no difficulty in understanding what form was meant, when names, or\r\ntables and figures, were cited from the various books. Of such works,\r\nthose of Agardh[56], Harvey, and Kützing on the Algae, those of Nees\r\nvon Esenbeck[57], Elias Fries, Léveillé, and Berkeley on the Fungi, and\r\nespecially Corda’s elaborate work on the latter plants are the most\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nThe views entertained on the subject of the development and propagation\r\nof the lower Cryptogams down to the year 1850 were very uncertain\r\nand fluctuating. In some Algae, Fungi, and Lichens certain organs of\r\nmultiplication and propagation were known, in others they were quite\r\nunknown; some forms appeared in places and under circumstances which\r\nseemed to necessitate the assumption of spontaneous generation; in 1827\r\nMeyen declared that the small Algae, known as ‘Priestley’s matter,’\r\nwhich are formed in stagnant water and even in closed vessels, are\r\nproduced by free generation, and Kützing endeavoured to show this by\r\nexperiment in 1833; some Fungi were regarded as diseased growths from\r\nother organisms, many were supposed to spring up spontaneously, though\r\nthey might be capable at the same time of propagating themselves by\r\nspores; this view was shared by even the best botanists with regard to\r\nthe most simple Fungi up to 1850. But the systematic investigation of\r\nthe Algae and Fungi was as little hindered by the notion of spontaneous\r\ngeneration after 1850 as that of Phanerogams had been in the 17th\r\ncentury by the same notion; it was however at first affected by the\r\nview put forth by Hornschuch in 1821 and by Kützing in 1833, that the\r\nsimplest of all Alga-cells (Protococcus and Palmella), once produced\r\nspontaneously, could develop according to circumstances into a variety\r\nof Algae, and even of Lichens and Mosses; as some observers even\r\nnow consider Penicillium and Micrococcus to be the starting-points\r\nof very different Fungi. There was a difficulty also in drawing the\r\nboundary-line between the lower animals and plants; the difficulty was\r\nsolved by classing all objects capable of independent movement with\r\nanimals; thus whole families of Algae (the Volvocineae, Bacillariaceae,\r\nand others) were claimed by the zoologists, and when the swarmspores\r\nof a genuine Alga were seen for the first time in the act of escaping,\r\nthe phenomenon was described as the changing of the plant into an\r\nanimal. Trentepohl in 1807, and Unger in 1830, explained in this way\r\nthe escape of the zoospores of Vaucheria. The remarkable thing is, not\r\nthat such views were entertained, but that the majority of botanists\r\ncombined with them a belief in the constancy of species. But this\r\ndogma rendered good service to the science in this instance, for the\r\nbotanists, who at a later time applied themselves to the systematic\r\nexamination of the Algae and Fungi, confided in the constancy of the\r\nprocesses of development in each species, which they expected would\r\nassert itself in these forms as in the Mosses and higher plants.\r\n\r\nWith much that was obscure and doubtful, the result of occasional\r\nobservation accompanied by uncritical interpretation, the literature\r\nof the subject had contained for some time a certain number of single\r\nwell-established facts of real importance, which were well adapted\r\nto serve as starting-points for earnest and exact investigation.\r\nAmong the Algae the genera Spirogyra and Vaucheria especially had\r\nsupplied remarkable phenomena; Joseph Gärtner observed the formation\r\nof zygospores in Spirogyra in 1788, Hedwig saw in the mode of their\r\nproduction at least a suggestion of sexuality (1798), and Vaucher[58],\r\nin his ‘Histoire de Conferves d’eau douce,’ which appeared in 1803\r\nand was far in advance of its time, called conjugation distinctly a\r\nsexual process; the optical means at his disposal did not enable him\r\nto observe the fertilisation in Vaucheria (Ectosperma), which was\r\nnamed after him, though he described the sexual organs accurately;\r\nthe movement also of the zoospores in this genus escaped him, and\r\nTrentepohl first observed their escape and swarming in 1807[59].\r\nVaucher had also observed the formation of new nets in the old cells\r\nof Hydrodictyon, and Areschoug repeated the observation in 1842, when\r\nhe saw the swarming of young cells in the old ones. Bischoff, as early\r\nas 1828, saw the spermatozoids of Chara, though without understanding\r\nthem. Observations on conjugating Algae were multiplied; Ehrenberg in\r\n1834 saw corresponding phenomena in Closterium, and Morren described\r\nthem more exactly in 1836. The formation of swarmspores in fresh-water\r\nand salt-water Algae was frequently observed between 1820 and 1830,\r\nand in his ‘Neues System,’ iii, which appeared in 1839, Meyen gave a\r\nsummary of all that was known up to that time of the propagation of\r\nthe Algae. But a new aspect was given to the knowledge of the Algae by\r\nthose researches of Nägeli between the years 1844 and 1849, which have\r\nbeen already mentioned, and which are the first since Vaucher’s time\r\nthat can be regarded as systematic. Nägeli studied especially the laws\r\nof cell-division in sexual multiplication and growth, but he considered\r\nthe Florideae to be the only Algae that were sexually differentiated,\r\nand distinguished the rest as being without sexuality. Braun in his\r\n‘Verjüngung’ (1850) made numerous contributions to the biology of the\r\nfresh-water Algae, affording many and most interesting glimpses into\r\na connection still little understood between these forms; and in 1852\r\nhe gave an account of the history of growth in the Characeae, a work\r\nconceived in Nägeli’s spirit and a model of scientific research, in\r\nwhich the mode of derivation of every cell from the apical cell of\r\nthe stem was shown, the sexual organs were minutely examined, and\r\nthe relation established between the direction of the ‘streaming’ of\r\nthe cell-contents and the morphology of the organs. Gustav Thuret\r\nhad already made the zoospores of the Algae the subject of detailed\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of affairs with respect to the Algae about the\r\nyear 1850, when Hofmeister made the formation of the embryo in the\r\nPhanerogams, the Vascular Cryptogams, and the Muscineae the central\r\npoint of investigation in morphology and systematic botany. He made\r\nit clear that a perfect insight into the whole cycle of development\r\nin the plant and into its affinities can only be obtained, if we\r\nsucceed in making its sexual propagation, the first commencement of\r\nthe embryo, the starting-point of the investigation. It was natural\r\nto expect as happy results from the embryology of the Algae, as had\r\nbeen obtained in the case of the higher plants; it was important\r\ntherefore, that the observer should no longer rest satisfied with a\r\nknowledge of the sexual multiplication of the Algae; he must enquire\r\ninto their asexual propagation, and by its aid discover the complete\r\nhistory of their development. Former observations suggested the\r\nprobability that here too sexual propagation is the prevailing rule;\r\nbut it was easy to foresee that it would be a task of great labour\r\nto make out a connected history of development, a task of which the\r\ncollectors who liked to call themselves systematists had never formed\r\na conception; but Nägeli’s and Hofmeister’s researches had made\r\nbotanists familiar with the highest demands of this kind, and the\r\nmen who were to gain new conquests for genuine science were already\r\nengaged in the work in 1850. A splendid result appeared in 1853, in\r\nThuret’s account of the fertilisation of the genus Fucus; this was a\r\nsimple process as a matter of embryology; but the sexual act was so\r\nclear, and even open to experimental treatment, that it threw light\r\nat once upon other cases more difficult to observe. Then followed\r\ndiscoveries of sexual processes in rapid succession; Pringsheim solved\r\nthe old enigma in Vaucheria in 1855, and between 1856 and 1858 in the\r\nOedogonieae, Saprolegnieae and Coleochaetae; in 1855 Cohn observed\r\nthe sexual formation of spores in Sphaeroplea. Pringsheim however was\r\nnot content with carefully observing the sexual act; he gave detailed\r\ndescriptions of growth in the same families in its progress cell by\r\ncell, of the formation of the sexual organs, and the development of\r\nthe sexual product. The asexual propagations which are intercalated\r\ninto the vegetation and embryology were shown in their true connection.\r\nProcesses were recognised which often recalled the alternation of\r\ngenerations in the Muscineae; it was shown that very different\r\nforms of sexuality and of general development occur in the Algae,\r\nand these led to the formation of systematic groups, quite different\r\nfrom those founded on the superficial observation of collectors. It\r\nsoon appeared in the Algae, and later in the Fungi and Lichens, that\r\nspecial investigation must lay new foundations for the system. From\r\nthe confused mass of forms not before understood, Pringsheim brought\r\nout a series of characteristic groups, which, thoroughly examined and\r\nskilfully described in words and by figures, stood out as islands in\r\nthe chaotic sea of still unexamined forms, and threw light in many ways\r\non all around them. In like manner the morphology of the Conjugatae\r\nwas thoroughly examined by De Bary before 1860; fragments of the\r\nhistory of development in the Algae were added by Thuret, and he and\r\nBornet cleared up the remarkable embryology of the Florideae in 1867,\r\nwhile Pringsheim established the pairing of the swarmspores in the\r\nVolvocineae in 1869. The Algae offer at present a greater variety in\r\nthe processes of development than any other class of plants; sexual and\r\nasexual propagation and growth work one into the other in a way which\r\nopens entirely new glimpses into the nature of the vegetable world.\r\n\r\nThe old conceptions of the nature of plants had been greatly modified\r\nby Hofmeister’s discovery of the alternation of generations, and the\r\nreduction to it of the formation of the seed in Phanerogams; in like\r\nmanner the first beginnings of plant-life, the simplest forms of\r\nAlgae, exhibit phenomena, which compel us to revise our fundamental\r\nconceptions of morphology, if we are ever to be able to give a\r\nsystematic view of the whole vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe methodical examination of the Fungi after 1850 led to similar but\r\nstill more comprehensive results. From earliest times the Fungi had\r\nbeen objects of wonder and superstition; what Hieronymus Bock said of\r\nthem has been told in the first chapter; this was repeated by Kaspar\r\nBauhin, and similar notions existed till late into our own century;\r\nabout the middle of the 17th century Otto Von Münchausen thought that\r\nmushrooms were the habitations of Polypes, and Linnaeus assented to\r\nthat view. What the nature-philosophers, as Nees von Esenbeck for\r\ninstance, had to say on the nature of Fungi, need not be reproduced\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nStill some useful observations had been accumulating for some time on\r\nthis subject; as early as 1729 Micheli[60] had collected the spores\r\nof numerous Fungi, had sown them and obtained not only mycelia but\r\nalso sporophores (fructifications), and Gleditsch confirmed these\r\nobservations in 1753; Jacob Christian Schaeffer[61] about the year\r\n1762 published very good figures of all the Fungi of Bavaria and the\r\nPalatinate, and collected the spores of many species. Yet Rudolphi\r\nand Link at the beginning of the present century ventured to deny the\r\ngermination of the spores of Fungi; Persoon in 1818 thought that some\r\nFungi grow from spores, others from spontaneous generation. A decided\r\nimprovement appears after 1820 in the views of botanists with respect\r\nto Fungi, and to this Ehrenberg’s elaborate essay, ‘De Mycetogenesi,’\r\npublished in that year in the Leopoldina, contributed greatly. In that\r\nwork he collected together all that was then known on the nature and\r\npropagation of the Fungi, and communicated observations of his own\r\non spores and their germination; he gave figures also of the course\r\nof the hyphae in large sporophores and in other parts, but his most\r\nimportant service was a description of the first observed case of\r\nsexuality in a Mould, namely, the conjugation of the branches of\r\nSyzygites. In the same year Nees von Esenbeck sowed Mucor stolonifer\r\non bread, and obtained ripe sporangia in three days (Flora, 1820, p.\r\n528); Dutrochet proved in 1834 (Mém. ii. p. 173) that the larger Fungi\r\nare only the sporophores of a filiform branching plant, which spreads\r\nusually under ground or in the interstices of organic substances, and\r\nhad been till that time regarded as a peculiar form of Fungus under\r\nthe name of Byssus. Soon after, Trog (Flora, 1837, p. 609) carried\r\nthese observations further; he distinguished the mycelium from the\r\nsporophore, and pointed out that the former is often perennial and is\r\nthe first product of the germinating spores. He made an attempt to\r\nexamine the morphology of the larger sporophores, and showed that it\r\nwas possible to collect the spores of mushrooms on paper, and that\r\nthose of Peziza and Helvella are forcibly ejected in little clouds\r\nof dust; he also produced new proofs of Gleditsch’s statement, that\r\nthe spores of Fungi are disseminated everywhere by the air. Schmitz\r\npublished in ‘Linnaea,’ between the years 1842 and 1845 excellent\r\nobservations on the growth and mode of life of several of the larger\r\nFungi. It was not unnecessary at that time to make it clearly\r\nunderstood that the spores of Fungi reproduce their species exactly.\r\n\r\nBut the lower, the small and simple Fungi, those especially which are\r\nparasitic on plants and animals, were the most attractive objects in\r\nthe whole field of mycology. Here were difficulties in abundance, here\r\nwere the darkest enigmas with which botany has ever had to deal, here\r\nwas new ground to be slowly won by extreme scientific circumspection\r\nand foresight. In these forms, as in the Algae, the first thing to\r\nbe done was to make out the complete history of development in a few\r\nspecies; but it was much more difficult in the Fungi than in the Algae\r\nto discover what properly belonged to one cycle of development, and\r\nto separate it from casual phases of development of other associated\r\nFungi. The merit of first breaking ground in this direction belongs\r\nto the brothers Tulasne, who published before 1850 the first more\r\nexact researches into the Smuts and Rusts; these were followed by a\r\nlong series of excellent works on different forms of Fungi, especially\r\nthe subterranean, whose mode of life and anatomy were described and\r\nillustrated by splendid figures; but their account of the development\r\nof Ergot of rye (1853), their further investigations into the\r\nformation of the spores and the germination of Cystopus, Puccinia,\r\nTilletia, and Ustilago, and their discovery of the sexual organs in\r\nPeronospora before 1861, were of greater theoretical importance.\r\nThe ‘Selecta Fungorum Carpologia,’ which appeared in three volumes\r\nfrom 1861 to 1865 with fine figures, some of which represented the\r\nprocess of development, contributed greatly to the reformation of\r\nmycology. Meanwhile, Cessati had published investigations into the\r\nMuscardine-fungus of the silkworm-caterpillar, and Cohn into a\r\nremarkable Mould, the Pilobolus.\r\n\r\nBut mycology owes its present form to none more than to ANTON DE BARY,\r\nwhose writings, the fruit of twenty years’ labour, it would take too\r\nmuch space to enumerate one by one. With a correct understanding of\r\nthe only means which can lead to sure results in this difficult branch\r\nof study, De Bary made it his first endeavour to perfect the methods\r\nof observation, and not only sought for the stages of development of\r\nthe lower Fungi in their natural places of growth, but cultivated them\r\nhimself with all possible precautions, and thus obtained complete and\r\nuninterrupted series of developments. By these means he succeeded in\r\nproving that parasitic Fungi make their way into the inside of healthy\r\nplants and animals, and that this is the explanation of the remarkable\r\nfact, that Fungi live in the apparently uninjured tissue of other\r\norganisms, a fact which formerly had led to the supposition that such\r\nFungi owe their origin to spontaneous generation, or to the living\r\ncontents of the cells of their entertainers. Pringsheim had already\r\nobserved these occurrences in 1858 in the case of an unusually simple\r\nwater-fungus (Pythium). De Bary showed that the intrusive parasite\r\nvegetates inside the plant or animal which is its host, and afterwards\r\nsends out its organs of propagation into the open air, and that at\r\na given time the organism attacked by the fungus sickens or dies.\r\nThese investigations were not only of high scientific interest to\r\nthe biologist, but they produced a series of results of the greatest\r\nimportance to agriculture and forestry, and even to medicine.\r\n\r\nWith the Fungi, even more than with the Algae, the chief difficulty in\r\nmaking out a complete series of developments in the history of each\r\nspecies arose from the frequent intercalation of the asexual mode of\r\nmultiplication into the course of its development, and in the further\r\npeculiarity, that the several stages of development in some cases could\r\nonly be completed on different substrata. One of the most important\r\ntasks was to find the sexual organs, the existence of which was\r\nrendered probable by various analogies, and after De Bary had observed\r\nthe sexual organs in the Peronosporeae in 1861, he succeeded in 1863\r\nproving for the first time that the whole fruit-body of an Ascomycete\r\nis itself the product of a sexual act, which takes place on the threads\r\nof the mycelium.\r\n\r\nThe literature of mycology based on De Bary’s methods of observation\r\nand its actual results has been enriched by others also in various\r\ndirections since 1860; in the case of the Fungi, as in that of the\r\nAlgae, it is not possible yet to see to what results investigation\r\nwill ultimately lead; but it is one of the fairest fruits of strictly\r\ninductive method, that it has succeeded in smoothing this thorny\r\nand indeed perilous route, where the enquirer is constantly in\r\ndanger of being misled, and in satisfying the severest demands of\r\nscience. Conclusions have been already reached that are important for\r\nmorphology and systematic botany, and among these the establishment\r\nof the nature of the large sporophores, and of processes similar to\r\nthe alternation of generations in the higher Cryptogams should be\r\nespecially mentioned. But the most important result remains to be\r\ntold; it is, that the two classes of Algae and Fungi, hitherto kept\r\nstrictly separate, must obviously be now united, and an entirely\r\nnew classification adopted, in which Algae and Fungi recur as forms\r\ndiffering only in habit in various divisions founded on their\r\nmorphology[62].\r\n\r\nA few words must be given here to the Lichens. They are the division\r\nof the Thallophytes, whose true nature was last recognised, and\r\nthat only in modern times; till after 1850 scarcely more was known\r\nof their organisation than Wallroth had discovered in 1825[63],\r\nnamely, that green cells, known as gonidia are scattered through the\r\nfungus-like hyphal tissue of the thallus. After Mohl’s investigations\r\nin 1833, it was known that free spores were formed in the tubes of\r\nthe fructifications (apothecia), and that a dust collected from the\r\nthallus and consisting of a mixture of gonidia and hyphae was in a\r\ncondition to propagate the species. The genetic relation between\r\nthe chlorophyll-containing gonidia and the fungus-like hyphae long\r\ncontinued to be obscure, till at last, after 1868, it was shown that\r\nthe gonidia are true Algae, and the hyphal tissue a genuine Fungus, and\r\nthat therefore the Lichens are not a class co-ordinating with the Algae\r\nand Fungi, but a division of Ascomycetes, which have this peculiarity,\r\nthat they spin their threads round the plants on which they feed, and\r\ntake them up into their tissue. De Bary suggested this explanation, but\r\nit was Schwendener who adopted it without reserve and openly declared\r\nit, as much to the surprise as the annoyance of Lichenologists. It may\r\nbe foreseen that their opposition will yield to the weight of facts,\r\nwhich already leave no doubt in the minds of the unprejudiced.\r\n\r\nThus researches in the domain of the Thallophytes have led during the\r\nlast twenty years to a complete revolution in the views entertained\r\nwith respect to the nature of these organisms, and enriched botany with\r\na series of surprising achievements; and the movement there is still\r\nfar from having come to an end. But we must regard it as one of the\r\ngreat results for the whole science that through the examination of the\r\nlower and higher Cryptogams, morphology and systematic botany have been\r\nrescued from many ancient prejudices, that the survey has become freer,\r\nthe methods of investigation surer, the questions more clearly seen and\r\nput in more definite form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECOND BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     HISTORY OF VEGETABLE ANATOMY\r\n\r\n                              (1671-1860)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the substance of the more perfect plants consists of layers of\r\ndifferent constitution was a fact that could not escape the most\r\nuntutored observation in primitive times; ancient languages had still\r\nwords to designate the most obvious anatomical components of plants,\r\nrind, wood and pith. It was also easy to perceive that the pith\r\nconsists of an apparently homogeneous succulent mass, the wood of a\r\nfibrous substance, while the rind of woody plants is composed partly\r\nof membranous layers, partly of fibrous and pith-like tissue. The\r\nobtaining of threads for spinning from the rind of the flax-plant,\r\nfor instance, must have suggested some idea, if only a vague one, in\r\nthe earliest ages of the way, in which the fibrous could be separated\r\nfrom the pulpy part of the bark by decay and mechanical treatment.\r\nNeither Aristotle nor Theophrastus failed to compare these components\r\nof vegetable substance with corresponding ones in animal bodies, and\r\nit has been already shown in the first book how Cesalpino, following\r\nhis masters, took the pith for the truly living part of the plant and\r\nthe seat of the vegetable soul, and applied this idea in his morphology\r\nand physiology. He remarked that the root generally has no pith, and\r\nthat the part of the root which answers to the wood of the stem is\r\noften soft and fleshy; the composition of the leaves from a green and\r\nsucculent substance and strands of fibres at once suggested a certain\r\nresemblance to the green rind of the stem; and it was evidently this\r\nwhich led him to consider that not only the leaves, but also the\r\nleaf-forms of the flower-envelopes had their origin in the rind of\r\nthe stem, while the soft, pulpy, succulent condition of the unripe\r\nseeds and seed-vessels seemed to point to their identity with the pith.\r\nThat not only are juices contained in plants, but that they must move\r\nin them, could not escape the simplest reflection; and further, the\r\nbleeding of the vine, the flow of gum from resiniferous trees, the\r\ngushing of a milky juice from the wounds of certain plants, exhibited\r\nso striking a resemblance to the bleeding of a wound in the body of\r\nan animal, that the idea of canals inside the plant, which, like the\r\nveins in animals, contain those juices and set them in motion, appeared\r\nquite natural, as we see plainly from Cesalpino’s reflections on these\r\nstructural conditions. If we add that it was known that the seeds are\r\nenclosed in the fruits, and that the embryo, together with a pulpy mass\r\n(cotyledons and endosperm), are in their turn enclosed in the seed,\r\nwe have pretty well the whole inventory of phytotomic knowledge up to\r\nabout the middle of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nWith careful preparation and skilful dissection of suitable parts of\r\nplants, and attentive consideration of the changes produced by decay\r\nand corruption, anatomical knowledge might have been considerably\r\nenlarged at an earlier time; but seeing is an art that must be learnt\r\nand cultivated; a definite aim and end must stimulate the observer into\r\nwillingness to see exactly, and to distinguish and connect together\r\ncorrectly what he sees. But this art of seeing was not far advanced in\r\nthe middle of the 17th century. All that was achieved in this direction\r\ndid not go beyond the distinguishing the outer organs of leaf-forms and\r\nstem-forms, and we have seen in the first book how unsuccessful was the\r\nattempt to distinguish the minuter parts of the flower and fruit.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the microscope made small things seem large, and\r\nrevealed to sight what was too small to be seen without it; but the\r\nuse of magnifying glasses brought an advantage with it of a different\r\nkind—it taught those who used them to see scientifically and exactly.\r\nIn arming the eye with these increased powers the attention was\r\nconcentrated on definite points in the object; what was seen was to\r\nsome extent indistinct, and always only a small part of the whole\r\nobject; perception by means of the optic nerve had to be accompanied\r\nby conscious and intense reflection, in order to make the object,\r\nwhich is observed in part only with the magnifying glass, clear to\r\nthe mental eye in all the relations of the parts to one another and\r\nto the whole. Thus the eye armed with the microscope became itself a\r\nscientific instrument, which no longer hurried lightly over the object,\r\nbut was subjected to severe discipline by the mind of the observer\r\nand kept to methodical work. The philosopher Christian Wolff observed\r\nvery truly in 1721, that an object once seen with the microscope can\r\noften be distinguished afterwards with the naked eye; and this, which\r\nis the experience of every microscopist, is sufficient evidence of\r\nthe effect of the instrument in educating and training the eye. This\r\nremarkable fact appears also in another way. We saw in the history\r\nof morphology and systematic botany that botanists for a hundred\r\nyears scarcely attempted to make themselves masters in a scientific\r\nsense of the external and obvious relations of form in plants, and to\r\nconsider them from more general points of view. Jung was the first who\r\napplied systematic reflection to the morphological relations of plants\r\nwhich lay open before his eyes, and it was not till late in our own\r\ncentury that this part of botany was again handled in a scientific\r\nand methodical manner. This extremely slow progress in obtaining a\r\nmental mastery over external form in plants on the part of those\r\nwho are continually occupied with them appears to be due chiefly to\r\nthe fact, that the unassisted eye glances too impatiently over the\r\nform of the object, and the attention of the observer is disturbed\r\nby its hasty movements. In direct contrast to this customary want\r\nof thoughtfulness in contemplating the external form of plants, we\r\nfind the first observers with the microscope, Robert Hooke, Malpighi,\r\nGrew, and Leeuwenhoek in the latter half of the seventeenth century,\r\nendeavouring by earnest reflection to apply the powers of the mind\r\nto the objects seen with the assisted eye, to clear up the true\r\nnature of microscopic objects, and to explain the secrets of their\r\nconstitution. If we compare the works of these men with the utterances\r\nof the systematists of the same period on the relations of form in\r\nplants, we cannot fail to see how superior the matter of the former is\r\nin intellectual value. This appears most strikingly when we put what\r\nMalpighi and Grew tell us of the construction of the flower and fruit\r\nside by side with the knowledge of Tournefort, Bachmann, and Linnaeus\r\non the same subject.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement of the mental capacity of the observer by the\r\nmicroscope is however the result of long practice; the best microscope\r\nin unpractised hands is apt soon to become a tiresome toy. It would be\r\na great mistake to suppose that progress in the study of the anatomy\r\nof plants has simply depended on the perfecting of the microscope. It\r\nis obvious that the perception of anatomical objects must grow more\r\ndistinct as the magnifying power of the instrument is increased, and\r\nthe field of sight is made brighter and clearer, but these things by\r\nthemselves would not add much to real knowledge. In examining the\r\nstructure of plants, as in every science, it is necessary to work with\r\nthe mind upon the object seen with the eye of sense, to separate the\r\nimportant from the unimportant, to discover the logical connection\r\nbetween the several perceptions, and to have a special aim in the\r\nexamination; but the aim of the phytotomist can only be to obtain so\r\nclear an idea of the whole inner structure of the plant in all its\r\nconnections, that it can be reproduced by the imagination at any moment\r\nin full detail with the perfect distinctness of sense-perception. It is\r\nnot easy to attain this end because the more the microscope magnifies,\r\nthe smaller is the part of the whole object which it shows; skilful\r\nand well-considered preparation is required, careful combination of\r\ndifferent objects and long practice. The history of phytotomy shows\r\nhow difficult a task it is to combine the separate observations and\r\nto fashion what has been seen bit by bit into a clear and connected\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nIt appears then that progressive improvement of the microscope was\r\nnot in itself sufficient to ensure the advance of phytotomy. It would\r\nnot indeed be too much to say, that the progress which microscopic\r\nanatomy made step by step with the aid of imperfect instruments\r\nrepeatedly gave the impulse to energetic efforts to improve them. Only\r\npractical microscopists could tell where the real defects of existing\r\ninstruments lay; it was their anxiety to make them more manageable,\r\ntheir constant complaints of the poor performance of the optical\r\npart—complaints loudly expressed, especially at the end of the previous\r\nand the beginning of the present century, which urged the opticians\r\nto turn their attention to the microscope and to endeavour to make it\r\nmore perfect. Moreover, essential improvements in the instrument were\r\nmade by microscopists themselves. Thus Robert Hooke was the first who\r\nin 1760 gave the compound microscope a form convenient for scientific\r\nobservation, and Leeuwenhoek developed the powers of the simple\r\nmicroscope to their highest point. The modern microscope is greatly\r\nindebted for its perfectness to Amici; nor ought the name of von Mohl\r\nto be omitted here, who invented improved methods for microscopic\r\nmeasurement, and in his work ‘Mikrographie’ (1846) on the construction\r\nof the microscope gave many practical hints to the opticians.\r\n\r\nWe shall not then make the most important advances in the anatomy of\r\nplants depend as a matter of course and quite passively on the history\r\nof the microscope; they were determined here as in other parts of\r\nbotany by a logical necessity of their own; here as elsewhere we have\r\nto fix our eye on the objects pursued by successive enquirers. If for\r\nthis purpose we cast a glance over the history of the subject, it\r\nwill appear that its founders in the latter half of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, Malpighi and Grew, were chiefly bent on determining the\r\nconnection between the cellular and fibrous elements in the structure\r\nof plants. Two fundamental forms of tissue were assumed from the first,\r\nthe succulent cellular tissue composed of chambers or tubes, and, in\r\ncontrast to this, the elongated usually fibrous or tubular elementary\r\norgans, the distinction of which into open canals or vessels and\r\nfibres with closed ends continued to be doubtful. The characteristic\r\nfeature of this period is, that the investigation of the more delicate\r\nstructure is everywhere closely interwoven with reflections on the\r\nfunction of the elementary organs, and that thus anatomy and physiology\r\nsupport each other, but not without mutual injury through the\r\nimperfections of both. But the physiological interest far outweighed\r\nthe anatomical with the first phytotomists, who used anatomical\r\nresearch for the purposes of physiology.\r\n\r\nThe imperfectness of the microscope during the whole of the eighteenth\r\ncentury produced a certain disinclination to anatomical studies, which\r\nwere after all only regarded as auxiliary to physiology. The latter\r\nhad made very important progress without the help of anatomy in the\r\nhands of Hales, and later on towards the end of the 18th century in\r\nthose of Ingen-Houss and Senebier, and thus the interest in phytotomy\r\nwas almost extinguished. Not only was very little addition made to the\r\ncontributions of Malpighi and Grew during the 18th century, but they\r\nhad to some extent ceased to be understood.\r\n\r\nHowever towards the end of that time the microscope came again into\r\nfashion; in the compound form it had become somewhat more convenient\r\nand manageable; Hedwig showed how it revealed the organisation of the\r\nsmallest plants, and especially of the Mosses, and he examined also\r\nthe construction of cell-tissue and vascular bundles in the higher\r\nplants. But with the beginning of the present century the interest in\r\nphytotomy suddenly rose high again; Mirbel in France, Kurt Sprengel in\r\nGermany made the microscopic structure of plants once more the subject\r\nof serious investigation. The performances of both men were at first\r\nextremely weak and contradicted one another; a lively dispute on the\r\nnature of cells, fibres, and vessels grew up during the succeeding\r\nyears, and many German botanists soon took part in it; life was once\r\nmore infused into the whole subject, especially when the academy of\r\nGöttingen in 1804 offered a prize for the best essay on the disputed\r\npoints, for which Link, Rudolphi and Treviranus contended, while\r\nBernhardi occupied himself with private researches into the nature\r\nof vessels in plants. It was not much that was attained in this way;\r\nmen began once more from the beginning, and after 130 years Malpighi\r\nand Grew were still the authorities to whom everybody appealed. Yet\r\nthe questions now discussed were in the main different from the old\r\nones; Malpighi, Grew and Leeuwenhoek had chiefly set themselves the\r\ntask of studying the different tissues in their mutual connection; the\r\nmoderns were chiefly concerned to get a clearer understanding of the\r\nmore delicate construction of the various tissues themselves, to know\r\nwhat was the true account of cell-structure in parenchymatous tissue,\r\nand the real nature of vessels and fibres. That very slow progress was\r\nmade at first in this direction was due partly to the imperfectness\r\nof the microscope, and still more to very unskilful preparations, to\r\nthe influence of various prejudices, and to too slight exertion of the\r\nmind. But a comprehensive work by the younger Moldenhawer in 1812 was\r\na considerable step in advance. It is marked by careful and suitable\r\npreparation of the objects, and by critical examination of what was\r\nobserved by the writer himself and of what had been written by others;\r\nin fact it is a fresh commencement of a strict scientific treatment\r\nof phytotomy. Hugo von Mohl continued Moldenhawer’s work after 1828,\r\nand Meyen was a contemporary and a zealous student of phytotomy; but\r\nthe period in the study of vegetable anatomy which reaches to 1840 may\r\nbe said to have been brought to a conclusion chiefly by von Mohl’s\r\ncontributions. Weak as the beginnings were at the commencement of this\r\nperiod (1800-1840), and important as was the advance made by von Mohl\r\ntowards the end of it, yet we may include all that was done during that\r\ntime in one view, since the questions examined were essentially the\r\nsame; like Mirbel and Treviranus, Moldenhawer and Meyen, von Mohl was\r\nchiefly occupied up to the year 1840 in deciding the questions, what\r\nis the nature of the solid framework of cellulose in the plant in its\r\nmatured state, whether a single or double wall of membrane lies between\r\ntwo cell-spaces, what is the true account of pits and pores, and of the\r\nvarious forms of fibres and vessels; one great result of these efforts\r\nmust be mentioned, namely, the establishment of the fact that all the\r\nelementary organs of plants may be referred to one fundamental form,\r\nthe closed cell; that the fibres are only elongated cells, but that\r\ntrue vessels are formed by cells which are arranged in rows, and have\r\nentered into free communication with one another.\r\n\r\nPhytotomists before 1840, and von Mohl especially, had occasionally\r\npaid attention among other things to circumstances connected with the\r\nhistory of development, and single cases of the formation of various\r\ncells had been described by von Mohl and Mirbel between 1830 and\r\n1840, but greater interest was taken in the right understanding of\r\nthe structure of mature tissues; physiological questions also, though\r\nno longer of the first importance in anatomical investigations, were\r\nstill of weight, so far as the enquiry was influenced by the relation\r\nof anatomical structure to the functions of elementary organs. But\r\nwith Schleiden and Nägeli the question of historical development and\r\nthe purely morphological examination of interior structure assumed\r\nan exclusive prominence in phytotomy. The first commencement of\r\nvegetable cells especially and their growth were the subjects now\r\ndiscussed. Schleiden had proposed a theory of cell-formation before\r\n1840, which, resting on too few and inexact observations, referred\r\nall processes of cell-formation in the vegetable kingdom to a single\r\nform; it attracted great attention in the botanical world, but could\r\nnot easily be reconciled with what was already known; and in 1846 it\r\nwas completely refuted by Nägeli, who substituted for it the history\r\nof the formation of the various kinds of vegetable cells in their\r\nmain features, based on profound and extensive investigations. It was\r\nnatural that these researches into the formation of cells should turn\r\nthe attention of observers, which had hitherto been almost exclusively\r\ndevoted to the solid framework of cell-tissue, to the juicy contents of\r\ncells. Robert Brown had already discovered the cell-nucleus; Schleiden\r\nrecognised its more constant presence, but misunderstood its relation\r\nto cell-formation; Nägeli and von Mohl next demonstrated the peculiar\r\nnature of protoplasm, the most important component of vegetable cells,\r\nand especially the weighty part which it plays in their origination.\r\nUnger in 1855 called attention to the great resemblance which exists\r\nbetween the protoplasm of the vegetable cell and the sarkode of the\r\nmore simple animals,—a discovery which was subsequently brought into\r\nprominence by observations on the behaviour of the Myxomycetes,\r\nand after 1860 finally led zootomists as well as phytotomists to\r\nthe conclusion, that protoplasm is the foundation of all organic\r\ndevelopment, vegetable and animal. But there is yet another direction\r\nin which the study of the history of development by the phytotomist led\r\nto new points of view and to new results; we have already pointed in\r\nthe end of the first book to the way in which Nägeli after 1844 made\r\nthe sequences of cell-division in the growth of organs the basis for\r\nhis morphology, and how in this way the Cryptogams especially revealed\r\ntheir inner structure; we also noticed the splendid results which\r\nHofmeister achieved by his study of the development of the embryo; here\r\nwe have further to show, how after 1850 the various forms of tissue,\r\nespecially the vascular bundles, were examined by observation of the\r\nhistory of their development, and how in this way botanical science\r\nhas succeeded in explaining the inner histological connection between\r\nleaves and axes, shoots and parent-shoots, primary and secondary roots,\r\nand above all in gaining a correct insight into subsequent growth in\r\nthickness and so learning to understand the true mode of formation of a\r\nwoody body and of the secondary rind.\r\n\r\nIt is then the task of the following chapter to give a more detailed\r\naccount of the history of phytotomy, the salient points in which have\r\nnow been indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                PHYTOTOMY FOUNDED BY MALPIGHI AND GREW.\r\n\r\n                              1671-1682.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foundation of vegetable anatomy, indeed of all insight into the\r\nstructure of the substance of plants, is the knowledge of their\r\ncellular structure. We find the first perception of this truth in\r\na comprehensive work of ROBERT HOOKE[64], which appeared in London\r\nin 1667 under the title of ‘Micrographia or some physiological\r\ndescriptions of minute bodies made by magnifying glasses.’ The author\r\nof this remarkable book was not a botanist, but an investigator of\r\nnature of the kind more especially to be found in the seventeenth\r\ncentury; he was mathematician, chemist, physicist, a great mechanician,\r\nand later an architect, and moreover a philosopher of the new school\r\nthen rising. Beside many discoveries in various subjects he succeeded\r\nin 1660 in so far improving the compound microscope, that with\r\nconsiderable increase in magnifying power it had tolerably clear\r\ndefinition. With this instrument Henshaw in 1661 is stated to have\r\ndiscovered the vessels in walnut-wood, a fact not of importance for our\r\nhistory. Hooke himself was anxious to show the world how much could be\r\nseen with his improved instrument; as an adherent of the inductive\r\nmethod he desired to aid in perfecting the perceptions of sense which\r\nare the foundation of all human knowledge; with this feeling he\r\nsubmitted all sorts of objects to his glass, that it might be known how\r\nmuch the unassisted eye fails to perceive. He made what he saw texts\r\nfor discussions on a multiplicity of questions of the day. The book\r\ntherefore was not devoted to phytotomy; the structure of the substance\r\nof plants is noticed in the same incidental manner, as the discovery\r\nof parasitic fungi on leaves, or other similar matters. And what Hooke\r\nsaw of the structure of plants was not much, but it was new, and on\r\nthe whole fairly judged. It appears that he discovered the cellular\r\nstructure in plants by examining charcoal with his glass, and that he\r\nthen tried cork and other tissues. He says that a thin section of cork\r\non a black ground (by direct light therefore) looks like honey-comb; he\r\ndistinguishes between the hollow spaces (pores) and the dividing walls,\r\nand to the former he gives the name which they yet bear; he calls\r\nthem cells. The arrangement of the cork-cells in rows misleads him\r\ninto taking them for divisions of elongated hollow spaces, separated\r\nby diaphragms. These, he says, are the first microscopic pores, which\r\nhe or any one else had ever seen, and he regards the cell-spaces of\r\nplants as examples of the porousness of matter, as do the text books\r\nof physics up to modern times. Hooke employed his discovery especially\r\nto explain the physical qualities of cork; he estimates the number\r\nof pores in a cubic inch at about twelve hundred millions. He draws\r\nanother botanical conclusion; he gathers from the structure of the\r\ncork that it must be an outgrowth from the bark of a tree, and appeals\r\nto the statements of one Johnston in proof of this hypothesis. The\r\nfact, that cork is the bark of a tree, was therefore not yet known\r\nto all educated people in England. Hooke afterwards says that this\r\nkind of texture is not confined to cork; for as he examined the pith\r\nof elder and other trees with his microscope and the pulp of hollow\r\nstems, such as those of fennel, teasel and reed, he found a similar\r\nkind of structure with the difference only, that in the latter the\r\npores (cells) are arranged lengthwise, in cork in transverse rows. He\r\nsays that he has never seen any passages for communication between the\r\ncells, but that they must exist, because the nourishing juice passes\r\nfrom one to another; for he has seen how in fresh plants the cells are\r\nfilled with sap, as are the long pores in the wood; but these he found\r\nempty of sap in the carbonised wood, and filled with air.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that it was not much that Hooke saw with his improved\r\nmicroscope; thin cross-sections of the stem of balsam or gourd, two\r\nplants that grew at that time in every garden, would have shown the\r\nnaked eye as much or even more of vegetable structure. At the same time\r\nthere is proof here of what was said above on the influence of the\r\nmicroscope on the use of the eye; the pleasure in the performance of\r\nthe new instrument must first direct attention to things which can be\r\nseen without it, but were never seen.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of the appearance of Hooke’s ‘Micrographia’ Malpighi\r\nand Grew had already made the structure of the plant the subject of\r\ndetailed and systematic investigations, the results of which they\r\nlaid before the Royal Society in London almost at the same time in\r\n1671. The question to which of the two the priority belongs has been\r\nrepeatedly discussed, though the facts to be considered are undoubted.\r\nThe first part of Malpighi’s large work, the ‘Anatomes plantarum idea,’\r\nwhich appeared at a later time, is dated Bologna, November 1, 1671;\r\nand Grew, who from 1677 was Secretary to the Royal Society, informs\r\nus in the preface to his anatomical work of 1682, that Malpighi laid\r\nhis work before the Society on December 7, 1671, the same day on\r\nwhich Grew presented his treatise, ‘The Anatomy of plantes begun,’ in\r\nprint, having already tendered it in manuscript on the eleventh of\r\nMay in the same year. But it must be observed that these are not the\r\ndates of the larger works of the two men, but only of the preliminary\r\ncommunications, in which they gave a brief summary of the researches\r\nthey had then made; the fuller and more complete treatises appeared\r\nafterwards; the preliminary communications formed the first part of the\r\nlater works and to some extent the introduction to them. Malpighi’s\r\nlonger account was laid before the Society in 1674, while Grew produced\r\na series of essays on different parts of vegetable anatomy between 1672\r\nand 1682; and these appeared together with his first communication in\r\na large folio volume under the title, ‘The anatomie of plantes,’ in\r\n1682. Thus Grew had opportunity to use Malpighi’s ideas in his later\r\ncompositions; he actually did so, and the important point as regards\r\nthe question of priority is, that where he makes use of Malpighi he\r\ndistinctly quotes from him. No more is necessary to remove the serious\r\nimputation which Schleiden has made against Grew in the ‘Grundzüge’\r\n(1845), i. p. 207.\r\n\r\nWhoever has not himself read the elaborate works of Malpighi and Grew,\r\nbut knows them only from the quotations in later phytotomists, may\r\neasily imagine that these fathers of phytotomy had found their way\r\nto a theory of the cell, such as we now possess. But it is not so;\r\ntheir works have very little resemblance to modern descriptions of\r\nvegetable anatomy; the difference lies chiefly in this, that modern\r\nwriters in their accounts of the structure of plants start with the\r\nidea of the cell, and afterwards treat of the connection of cells\r\ninto masses of tissue. The founders of phytotomy on the contrary, as\r\nmight naturally be expected, consider first and foremost the coarser\r\nanatomical circumstances; they describe the rind, bast, wood, and\r\npith chiefly of woody dicotyledons, and the histological distinctions\r\nbetween root, stem, leaf, and fruit in their broader relations, and\r\nexamine the detail of the structure of buds, flowers, fruits, and seeds\r\nfor the most part only so far as it can be seen with the naked eye.\r\nThe more delicate structural conditions are afterwards discussed as a\r\nsupplement to this less minute anatomy and always in close connection\r\nwith it. The chief emphasis is laid on the consideration of the way\r\nin which the fibrous tissue connects with the succulent parenchyma,\r\nwhile such questions as the nature of the cell, the fibre, and the\r\nvessel are only incidentally touched upon or discussed at greater\r\nlength in the course of the exposition. The mode of investigation and\r\nexposition is therefore chiefly analytic, while in modern compendiums\r\nof phytotomy it is essentially synthetic. It need scarcely be said\r\nthat with this mode of treatment the questions which are now regarded\r\nas fundamentally important are either treated as of secondary moment,\r\nor are disregarded; we must not therefore, in judging of the merit of\r\nthese men, approach their works with the demands upon them which our\r\nmore advanced science would lead us to make. It would be quite wrong\r\neven to think of measuring the value of their books by the extent to\r\nwhich their contents agree with the modern cell-theory. Both of them\r\nhad enough to do to find their way at all in the new world which the\r\nmicroscope had revealed; many questions which have become trivial for\r\nus had then to be solved for the first time, and the chief merit of\r\nboth lies in this very effort to understand first of all the coarser\r\nrelations of the anatomical structure of plants; in this respect the\r\nstudy of their works may yet be recommended to beginners, because\r\nmodern phytotomical books are generally very imperfect on these\r\npoints. And yet we must not undervalue what Malpighi and Grew had to\r\nsay on the more delicate anatomy, and especially on the nature of the\r\nsolid framework of cell-membrane in the plant; imperfect and crude as\r\ntheir views on such points may be, yet they continued for more than a\r\nhundred years to be the foundation of all that was known about cellular\r\nstructure; and when phytotomy took a new flight at the beginning of the\r\npresent century, Malpighi’s and Grew’s scattered remarks on the union\r\nof cells with one another, and on the structure of fibres and vessels,\r\nwere adopted by the later phytotomists and connected with their own\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nIf the views of Malpighi and Grew agreed in the main on the points here\r\nmentioned, yet the style and manner of the two were very different.\r\nMalpighi kept more closely to that which could be directly seen;\r\nGrew delighted in tacking on a variety of theoretical discussions to\r\nhis observations, and especially endeavoured to follow the path of\r\nspeculation beyond the limits of what was visible with the microscope.\r\nMalpighi’s account reads like a masterly sketch, Grew’s like an\r\nelaborate production of great and almost pedantic carefulness; Malpighi\r\ndisplays a greater formal cultivation, and deals with the questions\r\nwith light touches, allusively, and almost in the tone of conversation.\r\nGrew on the other hand is at pains to reduce the new science to a\r\nlearned and well-studied system, and to bring it into connection with\r\nchemistry, physics, and above all with the Cartesian philosophy.\r\nMalpighi was one of the most famous physicians and zootomists of his\r\ntime, and treated phytotomy from the points of view already opened\r\nin zootomy; Grew too occupied himself occasionally with zootomy, but\r\nhe was a vegetable anatomist by profession, and gave himself up,\r\nespecially after 1688, almost exclusively to the study of the structure\r\nof plants with a devotion hardly to be paralleled till we come down to\r\nMirbel and von Mohl.\r\n\r\nAs in medicine in the 17th century human anatomy was intimately\r\nconnected with physiology, and the latter was not yet treated as\r\na distinct study, so the founders of phytotomy naturally combined\r\nthe physiological consideration of the functions of organs with the\r\nexamination of their structure. Considerations on the movement of sap\r\nand on food appear in the front of every anatomical enquiry; relations\r\nof structure, which the microscope could not reach, were assumed\r\nhypothetically on physiological grounds, although little positive was\r\nknown at the time about the functions of the organs of plants; hence\r\nrecourse was had to analogies between vegetable and animal life, and\r\nit is true that vegetable physiology received its first great impulse\r\nby this means, but occasion was given at the same time to many\r\nerrors, which in their turn often misled the anatomist. At present,\r\nwhen vegetable anatomy has separated itself more than is desirable\r\nfrom physiology, that is, from the investigation of the functions of\r\norgans, it is difficult, nay impossible, to give the reader a brief\r\naccount of the contents of these two books which form an epoch in the\r\nscience. I must confine myself to noticing a few chief points, which\r\nare historically connected with the further development of phytotomy,\r\nthough some of these are just the questions to which Malpighi and Grew\r\nonly gave occasional attention, and which it is therefore a little\r\nunjust to them to bring into prominent notice. I shall recur to the\r\nphysiological portion of their writings in the third book of this\r\nhistory, confining myself here to that which concerns the structural\r\nrelations of plants.\r\n\r\nThe phytotomical work of MARCELLO MALPIGHI[65] appeared under the title\r\n‘Anatome Plantarum,’ and to it was added a treatise on hens’ eggs\r\nduring the process of incubation (1675). The phytotomical portion of\r\nthe book separates into two main divisions, the first of which, the\r\n‘Anatomes Plantarum idea,’ was, as was stated above, completed in 1671,\r\nand contains a general abstract and survey of Malpighi’s views on the\r\nstructure and functions of vegetable organs in fourteen-and-a-half\r\nfolio pages; the second and much larger portion illustrates in detail\r\nby numerous examples and with the help of many copper-plates the views\r\nexpressed in the first part; it will answer our purpose best to turn\r\nprincipally to the connected expression of the author’s views in the\r\nfirst part.\r\n\r\nHe begins his remarks with the anatomy of the stem, and as the rind\r\nfirst attracts the eye, he takes it first. The outer part of it, he\r\nsays, the cuticle, consists of utricles or little sacs arranged in\r\nhorizontal rows; these die in time and decay, sometimes forming a dry\r\nepidermis. On the removal of the epidermis, layer after layer of woody\r\nfibre is disclosed, and these layers, usually forming reticulations and\r\nlying one on another, follow the longitudinal direction of the stem.\r\nThese fibrous bundles are composed of numerous fibres, and each single\r\nfibre of tubes which open into one another (‘quaelibet fibra insignis\r\nfistulis invicem hiantibus constat’) and so on. The interspaces of the\r\nnetwork are filled with roundish tubes, which usually have a horizontal\r\ndirection towards the wood. If the rind is removed the wood appears,\r\nchiefly composed of elongated fibres and tubes, and consisting of rings\r\nor vesicles open towards one another and arranged in longitudinal rows.\r\nThe fibres also of the wood do not run parallel to one another, but\r\nallow a network of angular anastomosing spaces to be formed between\r\nthem, the larger of which are filled with bundles of tubes, which run\r\nfrom the rind through these interspaces to the pith, etc., etc. Between\r\nthe fibrous and fistulose bundles of the wood lie the spiral tubes\r\n(‘spirales fistulae’), smaller in number but of larger size, so that in\r\ncross sections of the stem they appear with open orifices. They lie in\r\ndifferent positions, but the majority in concentric circles. He says\r\nthat in the course of ten years’ examination (from 1661 therefore) he\r\nfound these spiral tubes in all plants, and it may be added here that\r\nGrew in the introduction to his book expressly concedes the priority\r\nin this discovery to Malpighi; but Malpighi’s ideas on the subject\r\nof these tubes are extremely indistinct[66], and this gave occasion\r\nto much misinterpretation and to gross errors on the part of later\r\nwriters. Malpighi thought he observed a peristaltic movement in these\r\nvessels, a delusion to which many of the nature-philosophers were\r\nparticularly fond of surrendering themselves at the beginning of the\r\npresent century.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the bundles of fibres and the tracheae, Malpighi\r\nobserved a number of tubes in Ficus, Cupressus, and other plants, which\r\nallowed the escape of a milky juice, and he concludes that similar\r\nspecial tubes might be present also in the wood of stems from which\r\nmilk, turpentine, gum, and the like exude.\r\n\r\nSuch are the elementary organs of plants, as far as they were known to\r\nMalpighi; in the subsequent part of his book we find them applied to a\r\nhistology of the stem, and here a mistake at once makes its appearance,\r\nwhich, resting on his authority, was reproduced by the phytotomists of\r\nthe 18th and even of the early part of the 19th century,—the theory,\r\nnamely, that the young layers of wood in the stem originate in the\r\nperiodic transformation of the innermost layers of bark (secondary\r\nbast-layers); Malpighi was led into this mistake, as it appears, partly\r\nby the softness and light colour of the alburnum, partly by its fibrous\r\ncharacter. In this substance the spiral tubes are gradually formed, and\r\nas the mass becomes more solid and compact, it subsequently forms the\r\ntrue wood.\r\n\r\nThe pith lies in the centre of the stem, and, according to Malpighi,\r\nconsists of numerous rows of spheres (‘multiplici globulorum ordine’)\r\narranged longitudinally one after another, and composed of membranous\r\ntubes, as may be clearly seen in walnut, elder, and other trees. In\r\nthis place also he mentions the milk-vessels in the pith of the elder.\r\nPassing over many and various matters, it may be mentioned next that\r\nMalpighi recognises the connection of the layers of tissue in young\r\nshoots with those of the parent-stem, and very expressly notices the\r\nsame continuity of structure between the leaf and the axis of the\r\nshoot. He then briefly touches on the anatomical relations of the\r\nfruit and the seed, the existence of the embryo in the seed and its\r\nstructure, and then goes on to the roots. ‘The roots of trees are a\r\npart of the stem, which divides into branches and ultimately ends\r\nin capillary threads (‘capillamenta’); so that, in fact, trees are\r\nsimply fine tubes, which run separate from one another underground but\r\ngradually collect into bundles; these bundles unite further on with\r\nother and larger bundles, and all together ultimately join to form a\r\nsingle cylinder, the stem, which then by separation of the tubes at the\r\nopposite extremity stretches out its branches, and by continued gradual\r\nseparation of the larger into smaller finally expands into leaves, and\r\nso reaches its furthest limits.’ The conclusion of the whole account is\r\nchiefly concerned with the part played by the various kinds of tissue\r\nin the nourishment of the plant.\r\n\r\nIn the second part published in 1674, the different kinds of tissue in\r\nthe stem are discussed at greater length; here there is much that is\r\nreally good, but at the same time much that is imperfect to an extent\r\nwhich cannot be attributed solely to the inferiority of his microscope.\r\nVery excellent is the way in which he endeavours to make out the more\r\nobvious anatomical relations of the rind, the wood, and the pith, and\r\nin the texture of the rind and the wood connects the longitudinal\r\ncourse of the vessels and woody fibre with the horizontal course of the\r\nmedullary rays and the ‘silver-grain.’ The magnifying powers which he\r\nused must, to judge from his figures, have been very considerable; how\r\nmuch of what is imperfect in them is due to the indistinctness of the\r\nfield of view, and how much to inaccurate observation, we cannot say.\r\nFor instance, he sees the bordered pits in the wood of Conifers without\r\nperceiving the central pore, and represents them as coarse grains lying\r\non the outside of the wood-cells; it was unfortunate for Malpighi, as\r\nfor his successors, that the large vessels in the wood of dicotyledons,\r\nto which they gave most of their attention, are often filled with\r\nsecondary tissue (thylosis), which Malpighi figures Tab. vi, fig. 21,\r\nbut the true nature of which was not understood till 150 years later.\r\nMalpighi, like succeeding phytotomists till as late as 1830, lays great\r\nstress on the structure of the spiral vessels or tracheae, and mentions\r\nparticularly that they are surrounded by a sheath of woody fibre;\r\nbut he did not fall into the strange notions which Grew and other\r\nphytotomists entertained with regard to the nature of these vessels.\r\n\r\nWe may at present omit the numerous remarks on assimilation and the\r\nmovement of the sap; the descriptions and figures of the parts of\r\nbuds and of the course of the bundles of vessels in different parts\r\nof plants, and especially the analyses of the flower and fruit and\r\nthe examination of the seed and embryo, conducted with a carefulness\r\nremarkable for that time, deserve a fuller notice, but this would\r\ndetain us too long from our main subject.\r\n\r\nIf Malpighi’s work reads like a masterly sketch in which the author\r\nis bent only on giving the outlines of the architecture of plants,\r\nthe much more comprehensive work of NEHEMIAH GREW[67], ‘The anatomy\r\nof plantes’ (1682), has the appearance of a text-book of the subject\r\nthoroughly worked out in all its details; the tasteful elegance of\r\nMalpighi is here replaced by a copiousness of minute detail that is\r\noften too diffuse; while in Malpighi we only occasionally encounter\r\nthe philosophical prejudices of his time, which usually lead him\r\ninto mistakes, Grew’s treatise is everywhere interwoven with the\r\nphilosophical and theological notions of the England of that day;\r\nbut we are compensated for this by the more systematic way in which\r\nhe pursues the train of thought, and especially by the constant\r\neffort to give as clear a representation as possible of what he sees.\r\nThough he too everywhere introduces physiological considerations\r\ninto his anatomical investigation, yet he keeps himself free from\r\nmany preconceptions which his successors imported in this way into\r\nphytotomy. To mention one point by anticipation, he avoided the\r\nerroneous notion so common at a later time, and first definitively\r\nremoved by von Mohl in 1828, that the cell-walls must have visible\r\nopenings to serve for the movement of the sap.\r\n\r\nGrew’s work, as has been said, separates into two main divisions;\r\nthe first, ‘The anatomy of plants begun, with a general account of\r\nvegetation founded thereupon,’ was printed in 1671, and contains a\r\nbrief and rapid account of the general anatomy and physiology of\r\nplants in forty-nine folio pages. Then the anatomy of roots, stems,\r\nleaves, flowers, fruits and seeds appeared as separate treatises in the\r\nfollowing years up to 1682. We may pass over the chemical researches\r\nembodied in this work and the enquiries into the colours, taste and\r\nsmell of plants, as well as the previously issued treatise, ‘An idea of\r\na philosophical history of plants,’ which, as it was first laid before\r\nthe Royal Society in 1672, we may imagine to have been intended as a\r\ncounterpart to Malpighi’s ‘Anatomes plantarum idea,’ though it is very\r\ndifferent in character and admits much that is foreign to vegetable\r\nanatomy and physiology.\r\n\r\nWith Grew as with Malpighi the main point of enquiry is not the\r\nindividual cell, but the histology; after distinguishing, like\r\nMalpighi, between the parenchymatous tissue and the longitudinally\r\nelongated fibrous forms, the true vessels and the sap-conducting\r\ncanals, he is chiefly bent on explaining the combination of these\r\ntissues in the different organs of the plant; and in this point he is\r\nsuperior to Malpighi both in carefulness of description and in the\r\nbeauty of his delineations. Grew’s numerous figures on copper plates,\r\nmore carefully executed than Malpighi’s, give in fact so clear an idea\r\nespecially of the structure of the root and stem that a beginner may\r\nstill use them with advantage; such figures as those on plates 36 and\r\n40 and elsewhere show that he knew how to fashion his observations by\r\naid of much reflection into a clear representation of the thing seen;\r\nthere are, as might be expected, many errors in the details of the more\r\ndelicate structure of the various forms of vessels and cells.\r\n\r\nMalpighi had not said, whether he considered the cells of the\r\nparenchyma (the term parenchyma comes from Grew) to be perfectly closed\r\nor porous, nor how they cohere; Grew leaves no doubt on this point; he\r\nsays distinctly on page 61 that the cells or vesicles of the parenchyma\r\nare closed, that their walls are not traversed by any visible pores,\r\nso that the parenchyma may be compared to the foam of beer. He quotes\r\nMalpighi’s view respecting the vessels of the wood, and supplements\r\nit by saying that the spiral band is not always single, but that two\r\nor more bands entirely separate from one another may form the wall of\r\nthe vessel, and also that the spiral thread is not flat but roundish\r\nlike a wire, and its turns are more or less close together according to\r\nthe part of the plant. He also notices that the spiral tubes are never\r\nbranched, and that when they run straight, as in Arundo Donax, they can\r\nbe seen throughout considerable distances. The view of the structure of\r\nspiral vessels, which began with Malpighi and was maintained through\r\nthe whole of the 18th century, Grew (p. 117) expresses still more\r\ndistinctly than Malpighi; but it is to be observed that neither of\r\nthem clearly distinguished true spiral vessels with separable spiral\r\nthreads from vessels of the kind which occurs in secondary wood, and\r\nonly shows a spiral structure on being torn. From the way, says Grew,\r\nin which the threads are woven, it comes to pass that the vessels often\r\nunroll into a flat surface, as we may imagine a narrow ribbon wound in\r\na spiral about a round staff so that edge meets edge; and if the staff\r\nis drawn out, the ribbon so wound will remain behind in the form of a\r\ntube, and this would answer to an air-vessel in the plant. We should\r\nnotice specially that Grew, better taught than the phytotomists of the\r\n18th century, considers the vessels of the wood as air-passages, though\r\nthey sometimes convey water. But he goes on with his description of\r\nthe wall of the vessel; the flat surface disclosed by the unwinding of\r\na vessel is, he says, itself composed of many parallel threads, as in\r\nan artificial ribbon, and the threads that are spirally wound answer\r\nto the warp in an artificial tissue, being held together by transverse\r\nthreads, which correspond to the woof. To realise to ourselves this\r\nvery strange idea of the structure of a spiral vessel as it appeared to\r\nGrew, we ought to know that he thinks that all cell-walls, even those\r\nof the parenchyma, are composed of an extremely fine web; his previous\r\ncomparison of cell-tissue with foam was only intended to make the more\r\nobvious circumstances clear to the reader; his real idea is, that the\r\nsubstance of the walls of vessels and cells consists of an artificial\r\nweb of the finest threads. He hints at this on pages 76 and 77, and on\r\npage 120 he returns once more to this conception and dwells upon it at\r\ngreat length. The most exact comparison, he says, which we can make of\r\nthe whole body of a plant is with a piece of fine lace-tissue, such as\r\nwomen make upon a cushion; for the pith, the medullary rays, and the\r\nparenchyma of the rind are an extremely delicate and perfect tissue of\r\nthread. The threads of the pith run horizontally like the threads in a\r\npiece of woven stuff, and form the boundaries of the numerous vesicles\r\nof the pith and the rind, as the threads in a web bound the interstices\r\nin it. But the woody fibres and the air-vessels are perpendicular to\r\nthis tissue, and therefore at right angles to the horizontal threads\r\nof the parenchyma, just as the needles in a piece of lace work that\r\nlies on the cushion are perpendicular to the threads. To complete the\r\ncomparison we ought to suppose the needles to be hollow and the tissue\r\nof thread-lace in a thousand layers one above another. Grew himself\r\nstates incidentally, that he lit upon this notion from looking at\r\nshrivelled masses of tissue, when he naturally saw wrinkles and folds,\r\nwhich he took for threads. Besides he seems to have used blunt knives,\r\nwhich might easily tear the cell-walls into threads; so we might gather\r\nfrom the figure in Plate 40, where what he supposes to have been a\r\ntissue of thread from the walls of a cell is depicted quite plainly.\r\nLastly the observation of vessels with reticulated thickening, and\r\nparenchyma-cells with crossed striation may have contributed to his\r\nview.\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be superfluous to remark here, that Grew’s idea of this\r\nvery delicate structure of cell-walls has evidently given rise to the\r\ncommon expression cell-tissue (contextus cellulosus) when speaking\r\nof plants and animals, an expression which has become naturalised in\r\nmicroscopy, and is still retained though we no longer think of Grew’s\r\ncomparison of cell-structure with artificial lace. But the word tissue\r\nhas often misled later writers, as words are apt to do, and made them\r\nfound their conception of vegetable structure on the resemblance to an\r\nartificial tissue of membranes and threads.\r\n\r\nGrew, like Malpighi, derives the young layers of wood in the stem from\r\nthe innermost layers of the rind. The true wood, he says on page 114,\r\nis entirely composed of old lymph-vessels, that is of fibres, which lay\r\noriginally in the inner circumference of the rind. But by true woody\r\nsubstance he understands the fibrous components of the wood, excluding\r\nthe air-vessels; his lymph-vessels are the bast-fibres and similar\r\nforms; for, he goes on, the air-vessels with the medullary rays and\r\nthe true wood form what is commonly called the wood of a tree; he uses\r\nthe term air-vessels, not because these forms never contain sap, but\r\nbecause they only contain a vegetable air during the proper period of\r\nvegetation, when the vessels of the rind are filled with sap.\r\n\r\nThe above is certainly a very imperfect account of Grew’s services to\r\nphytotomy; for the points here made prominent were treated by him as\r\naccessories only to the coarser histological relations with which he\r\nchiefly occupied himself.\r\n\r\nThese two works of Malpighi and Grew, so important not only for botany\r\nbut for the whole range of natural science, were not followed during\r\nthe course of the next hundred and twenty years by a single production,\r\nwhich can claim in any respect to be of equal rank with them; that\r\nlong time was a period not of progress but of steady retrogression,\r\nas we shall see in the next chapter. But before the beginning of the\r\n18th century ANTON VON LEEUWENHOEK[68] made some contributions to\r\nthe knowledge of the details of vegetable anatomy, if not exactly\r\nto the settling of very important points in it; he communicated his\r\nobservations on animal and vegetable anatomy in numerous letters to the\r\nRoyal Society of London, and these appeared for the first time in a\r\ncollected form in Delft in 1695 under the title of ‘Arcana naturae.’ It\r\nis not easy to gain a clear idea of Leeuwenhoek’s phytotomic knowledge\r\nfrom his scattered statements. He too discussed the less minute anatomy\r\nof fruits, seeds and embryos, and among other things he made occasional\r\nobservations on germination, and many on the structure of different\r\nwoods. But all bears the stamp of only occasional study of plants; he\r\nwas led to his observations by questions of the nature-philosophy then\r\nin vogue, and especially by such as were connected with the theory of\r\nevolution, not unfrequently by mere curiosity and pleasure in things\r\nobscure and inaccessible to ordinary people, but he did not gain from\r\nthem a general idea of the structure of plants. In the course of\r\nthese observations he did unquestionable service in perfecting simple\r\nmagnifying glasses; he made a large number with his own hands, and\r\nthese possessed magnifying powers evidently not at the command either\r\nof Malpighi or Grew. By aid of such glasses he discovered the vessels\r\nof secondary wood which are not spirally thickened but beset with\r\npits, the true character of which however he did not investigate. He\r\nwas the first moreover who perceived the crystals in vegetable tissue,\r\nnamely in the rhizome of Iris florentina and in species of Smilax,\r\nand this could only be done with strong magnifying powers. In other\r\nmatters he repeats the histological views of Malpighi and Grew, and on\r\nthe whole his numerous communications seem painfully fragmentary and\r\nunscientific in presence of Malpighi’s elegance and perspicuity, and\r\nGrew’s systematic thoroughness. His figures too, which were not drawn\r\nby himself, are with some exceptions inferior to those of his great\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                 PHYTOTOMY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMalpighi had no successor of note in Italy; in England the new light\r\nwas extinguished with Hooke and Grew, and has so remained, we may\r\nalmost say, till the present day; in Holland also Leeuwenhoek found\r\nnone to follow him of equal rank with himself, and the work done in\r\nGermany up to the year 1770 is more wretched than can well be imagined.\r\nThere was in fact no original phytotomic research in the first fifty\r\nor sixty years of the last century; the accounts which were given of\r\nthe structure of plants were taken from Malpighi, Grew, and Leeuwenhoek\r\nby persons, who, unable to observe themselves, did not understand\r\ntheir authors and stated things not to be found in their writings.\r\nThe feebler and obscurer notions of the older writers were preserved\r\nwith a particular preference, and thus it was Grew’s complicated idea\r\nof the web-like structure of cell-walls that made most impression on\r\nthose who reported him. This state of decline must not be ascribed to\r\nimperfect microscopes only; these certainly were not good, and still\r\nless conveniently fitted up; but no one saw and described clearly even\r\nwhat can be seen with the naked eye or with very small magnifying\r\npower; the worst part of the case was that no one tried fully to\r\nunderstand either the little he saw himself or the observations to be\r\nfound in older works, but contented himself from want of reflection\r\nwith most misty notions of the inner structure of plants. It is not\r\neasy to discover the causes of this decline in phytotomy in the first\r\nhalf of the 18th century; but one of the most important appears to lie\r\nin the circumstance, that botanists, following in this the example of\r\nMalpighi and Grew, did not make the knowledge of structure the sole\r\naim in their anatomical investigations, but sought it chiefly for the\r\npurpose of explaining physiological processes. The food and circulation\r\nof the sap of plants were more and more the prominent questions, and\r\nHales showed how much may be done in this direction even without the\r\nmicroscope; the interest therefore of the few, who like Bonnet and Du\r\nHamel occupied themselves almost entirely with vegetable physiology,\r\nwas concentrated on experiment.\r\n\r\nOthers who knew how to use the microscope, as the Baron von\r\nGleichen-Russworm and Koelreuter, were drawn away from the examination\r\nof the structure of vegetable organs by their attention to the\r\nprocesses of fertilisation and especially of propagation. The real\r\nbotanists, according to the ideas of the time, and specially those\r\nwho belonged to the Linnaean school, considered physiological and\r\nanatomical researches generally to be of secondary importance, if\r\nnot mere trifling, with which an earnest collector had no need to\r\nconcern himself. That Linnaeus himself thought little of microscopical\r\nphytotomy is sufficiently shown by what has been said of him in the\r\nfirst book.\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while to notice each of the few small treatises on the\r\nsubject which appeared towards 1760, for they contain nothing new; a\r\nfew examples will show the truth of the opinion here expressed on the\r\ngeneral condition of phytotomy at this time.\r\n\r\nWe first of all encounter a writer, whom few would expect to find\r\namong the phytotomists, the well-known philosopher Christian Baron von\r\nWolff, who in his two works, ‘Vernünftige Gedanken von den Wirkungen\r\nder Natur,’ Magdeburg (1723) and ‘Allerhand nützliche Versuche,’ Halle\r\n(1721) gives here and there descriptions of microscopes and discusses\r\nsubjects connected with phytotomy. This he does more particularly\r\nin the latter work, where he describes a compound microscope with a\r\nfocussing lens between the objective and the ocular but without a\r\nmirror, an instrument which must have served therefore for observing\r\nwith the light from above on an opaque surface; the objective was a\r\nsimple lens. But to magnify objects more strongly, he says that he\r\nused a simple instead of this compound instrument, as was more the\r\ncustom at the time. Like a true amateur Wolff submitted all sorts of\r\nsmall and delicate objects to his glass, without examining any of\r\nthem thoroughly and persistently. His phytotomic gains were small; he\r\nobserved for instance that starch-flour (powder) consists of grains,\r\nbut believed from the way in which they refracted light that they were\r\nsmall vesicles filled with a fluid; yet he satisfied himself that these\r\ngrains are already in the grains of rye and therefore not produced in\r\nthe grinding. He laid thin sections of portions of plants on glass\r\nwhich was too imperfectly polished to allow of his seeing anything\r\ndistinctly. His pupil Thümmig in his ‘Meletemata’ (1736) addressed\r\nhimself to the subject with still less skill. By the case of these\r\ntwo men we may see plainly that want of success was due much less to\r\nthe imperfectness of the microscope than to unskilful management and\r\nunsuitable preparation. But Wolff and Thümmig at least endeavoured\r\nto see something for themselves of the structure of plants; a famous\r\nbotanist of the time, Ludwig, plainly never made a similar attempt,\r\nfor in his ‘Institutiones regni vegetabilis’ (1742) he speaks of the\r\ninner structure of the plant in the following manner; ‘Laminae or\r\nmembranous pellicles, so connected together that they form little\r\ncavities or small cells and often reticulated by the intervention of\r\nfine threads, form the cell-tissue which we see pervading all parts\r\nof plants. These are what Malpighi and others call tubes, since they\r\nappear in different parts in the form of rows of connected vesicles!’\r\nBoehmer’s ‘Dissertatio de celluloso contextu’ (1785) is still worse;\r\n‘White elastic thicker or thinner fibres and threads woven together\r\nof differing shape and size form cavities or cells or caverns, and\r\nare usually known by the name of cell-tissue.’ We see what mischief\r\nGrew did with his theory of the fibrous structure of the cell-walls,\r\nand how the expression cell-tissue literally taken led the botanists\r\nhere named and others into utterly incorrect ideas. The works of Du\r\nHamel, Comparetti, and Senebier show that such misconceptions were not\r\nconfined to Germany, and Hill, a countryman of Grew, according to von\r\nMohl’s account pictured to himself cells as cups standing one above\r\nanother, closed below and open above.\r\n\r\nBaron von Gleichen-Russworm (1717-1783), privy counsellor to the\r\nMargrave of Anspach, gave much attention to the perfecting of the\r\nmechanical arrangements of the microscope, but his plates themselves\r\nshow how strangely unsuitable these arrangements were. With these\r\ninstruments he made many observations, which are recorded in two\r\nvoluminous works, ‘Das Neueste aus dem Reich der Pflanzen’ (1764)\r\nand ‘Auserlesene mikroskopische Entdeckungen’ (1777-1781). But these\r\nworks contain little or nothing about microscopic anatomy or the\r\nstructure of vegetable cells. His observations with the microscope\r\nare chiefly devoted to processes of fertilisation and to proving that\r\nspermatozoa are contained in the pollen[69], and in connection with\r\nthese subjects he gives magnified figures of many small flowers, some\r\nof them beautifully executed; these figures must have made his works\r\nvery instructive to many in their time. He saw the stomata, which Grew\r\nhad already discovered, on the leaves of ferns, but took them for the\r\nmale organs of fertilisation, which at the same time showed that he was\r\nstill unacquainted with the existence of stomata in phanerogams.\r\n\r\nCASPAR FRIEDRICH WOLFF[70] in his efforts in phytotomy stands a\r\nsolitary figure among his contemporaries, not only because he was the\r\nfirst since Malpighi and Grew who devoted labour and perseverance to\r\nthe study of the anatomy of plants, but still more because at a time,\r\nwhen the structure even of matured vegetable organs was almost a\r\nforgotten subject, he endeavoured to penetrate into the history of the\r\ndevelopment of this structure and the formation of cellular tissue.\r\nUnfortunately he was not directed to this by an exclusive interest in\r\nphytotomy, but by a more general question which he endeavoured to set\r\nat rest in this manner; he wished to refute the prevailing theory of\r\nevolution by demonstrating the development of the organs of plants,\r\nand to obtain an inductive basis for his doctrine of epigenesis.\r\nThough he was often diverted by these means from the pursuit of purely\r\nphytotomic questions, yet his famous work, ‘Theoria Generationis’\r\n(1759) is nevertheless important in the history of phytotomy; for\r\nthough it was disregarded by botanists during the succeeding forty\r\nyears, or at any rate exercised no noticeable influence, yet it was\r\nWolff’s doctrine of the formation of cellular structure in plants\r\nwhich was in the main adopted by Mirbel at the beginning of the\r\npresent century, and the opposition which it encountered contributed\r\nessentially to the further advance of phytotomy. This late but\r\nlasting influence of Caspar Friedrich Wolff’s work was due not to the\r\nactual correctness but to the thoughtfulness of his observations, and\r\nto the earnest desire which inspired them to search out the true\r\nnature of vegetable cell-structure and to explain it on physical and\r\nphilosophical grounds. The observations themselves on this point are\r\nhighly inexact, and influenced by preconceived opinions, and his\r\naccount of them is rendered obscure and often quite intolerable by\r\nhis eagerness to give an immediate philosophic explanation of objects\r\nwhich he had only imperfectly examined. His efforts to follow the\r\ncourse of development in the first beginnings of the formation of\r\ncell-tissue were evidently not seconded by sufficient knowledge of\r\nthe structure of matured organs, and, to judge by his figures and by\r\nhis theoretical reflections, his microscope was of insufficient power\r\nand its definition imperfect. Notwithstanding all these deficiencies,\r\nWolff’s treatise is doubtless the most important work on phytotomy that\r\nappeared in the period between Grew and Mirbel, not, as has been said,\r\non account of any particular excellence of observation, but because its\r\nauthor was able to make some use of what he saw, and to found a theory\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nAccording to that theory all the youngest parts of plants, the punctum\r\nvegetationis in the stem, which Wolff first distinguished, the youngest\r\nleaves and parts of the flower, consist of a transparent gelatinous\r\nsubstance; this is saturated with nutrient sap, which is secreted at\r\nfirst in very small drops (we might say vacuoles), and these, as they\r\ngradually gain in circumference, expand the intermediate substance and\r\nso present enlarged cell-spaces. The intermediate substance therefore\r\nanswers to what we should now call the cell-walls, only these are at\r\nfirst much thicker, and are constantly becoming thinner with the growth\r\nof the cell-spaces. We may compare young vegetable tissue, formed as\r\nWolff imagines, with the porosity of fermenting dough, except that the\r\npores are not filled with gas but with a fluid. It is plain from the\r\nabove description that the vesicles or pores, as Wolff names the cells,\r\nare connected together from the first by the intermediate substance,\r\nand that one lamina or cell-membrane only lies between each of two\r\nadjoining cells, a point which succeeding phytotomists were a long\r\ntime in determining. As cells are formed by the secretion of drops of\r\nsap in the fundamental substance which is at first homogeneous, so\r\nvessels, according to Wolff, are produced by longitudinal extension of\r\na drop in the mucilage and formation of a canal; consequently adjoining\r\nvessels must be separated from one another by a single lamina of the\r\nfundamental substance. Though Wolff expressly mentions the movement of\r\nthe sap within the firm mucilaginous substance between the cellular\r\ncavities and the vascular canals, a movement of diffusion as it might\r\nnow be termed, he inconsistently enough thinks it necessary to assume\r\nthe existence of perforations in the bounding-walls of cells and\r\nvessels to serve for the movement of sap from cell to cell and vessel\r\nto vessel; yet in the single case in which he succeeded in obtaining\r\nisolated cells, namely in ripe fruits, he was obliged to allow that the\r\nwalls were closed.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the parts of plants, according to Wolff, is effected by\r\nexpansion of existing cells and vessels, and by the formation of new\r\nones between them in the same way as the first vacuoles were formed\r\nin the mucilaginous substance of very young organs; that is to say,\r\nthe sap which saturates the solid substance between the passages and\r\ncavities of the tissue separates in the form of drops, which increase\r\nin size and then appear as cells and vessels introduced between the\r\nolder ones. The substance between the passages and cavities, at first\r\nsoft and extensible, becomes firmer and harder with increasing age,\r\nand at the same time a hardening substance may be deposited on it from\r\nthe sap which is stagnant in the cell-cavities and in movement in the\r\nvascular passages, and this substance in many cases appears as their\r\nproper membrane.\r\n\r\nThis is in all essential points Wolff’s theory. We may omit his\r\nstatements on the subject of the first formation of leaves at the\r\ngrowing point and of the development of the parts of the flower, as\r\nwell as his physiological views on food and sexuality, which remained\r\nfor a long time without influence on the growth of opinion, and mention\r\nonly his doctrine of the growth of thickness of the stem. The stem is\r\noriginally the prolongation of all the leaf-stalks united together.\r\nAs many bundles of vessels are formed in the developed stem as there\r\nare leaves springing from the vegetative axis; each leaf has a single\r\nvascular bundle belonging to it in the stem, in modern phraseology\r\nan inner leaf-trace. The union of these bundles from the different\r\nleaves forms the rind of the stem; but if the leaves are very numerous,\r\ntheir descending bundles form a closed cylinder, and if the stem is\r\nperennial, the fresh production of leaves every year produces new zones\r\nof wood of this kind every year, which are the yearly rings. This view\r\nof Wolff’s on the growth of the stem in thickness bears an unmistakable\r\nresemblance to the theory afterwards suggested by Du Petit-Thouars,\r\naccording to which the roots which descend from the buds are supposed\r\nto effect the thickening of the stem.\r\n\r\nThe contests between Mirbel and his German antagonists at the beginning\r\nof the present century will bring us back again to the more important\r\npoints in Wolff’s theory of the cell. Contemporary botanists paid less\r\nattention to the ‘Theoria Generationis’ than they did to Hedwig’s[71]\r\nphytotomic views, not on the formation of cells, but on the structure\r\nof mature tissue. HEDWIG had given various figures and descriptions of\r\nphytotomic subjects in his ‘Fundamentum Historiae Muscorum’ (1782) and\r\nafterwards in his ‘Theoria Generationis’ (1784); but he treats these\r\ntopics at greater length in his treatise ‘De fibrae vegetabilis et\r\nanimalis ortu,’ published in 1789, and known to the author of this work\r\nonly imperfectly from quotations in later writers. Hedwig’s figures\r\nof histological objects appear to be better than those of any of his\r\npredecessors; they show that he used strong magnifying powers, and that\r\nhis glass had a clear field of sight. His defect lay in preconceived\r\nopinions and hasty interpretation of what he observed. In order to\r\nrefute Gleichen’s view of the stomata in ferns, he demonstrated the\r\nexistence of these organs in many phanerogams, and observed the opening\r\nof the slits, which he named ‘spiracula.’ On the epidermis which he\r\nhad removed for the purpose of these observations he saw plainly the\r\ndouble contour lines bounding the epidermis-cells, and therefore the\r\ncell-walls, which are at right angles to the surface. These he took\r\nfor a particular form of vessel, and called them ‘vasa reducentia’ or\r\n‘lymphatica,’ and afterwards ‘vasa exhalantia,’ and he thought that\r\nhe had found them again in the interior of parenchymatous tissue,\r\nevidently taking the places where three wall-surfaces meet for vessels;\r\nsuch vessels he also saw in the milk-cells of Asclepias, described in\r\n1779 by the elder Moldenhawer, who seems himself to have regarded even\r\nthe intercellular spaces in the pith of the rose as equivalent to these\r\nmilk-cells. The word vessel even in the 18th century was used in such\r\nan indefinite manner, that the broad air-tubes of the wood and the\r\nfinest fibres were called vessels. Hedwig’s idea of the construction\r\nof spiral vessels was strange enough; he took the spiral band itself\r\nfor the vessel, and supposed it to be hollow because it is coloured by\r\nabsorption of coloured fluids; in those spiral vessels in which the\r\nturns of the spiral band are distant he saw, it is true, the delicate\r\noriginal membrane which lies between the turns, but he supposed that it\r\nlay inside the spiral band, which was wound round it on the outside. On\r\nthe second plate of the first part of the ‘Historia Muscorum’ he even\r\nfigures the network of ridges which the adjoining cells have left on\r\nthe wall of the spiral vessel, but explains it as wrinkles caused by\r\ndesiccation.\r\n\r\nHedwig was without doubt a very practised microscopist, and he\r\nconstantly recommended the extremest care in the interpretation of\r\nall that the instrument reveals; but if an observer so careful and\r\npractised, who moreover was provided with a glass of tolerably strong\r\nmagnifying power, fell into such gross mistakes, it cannot surprise us\r\nif others, as P. Schrank, Medicus, Brunn, and Senebier, accomplished\r\nstill less. These highly unimportant achievements are all that mark the\r\nclose of the 18th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n   EXAMINATION OF THE MATURED FRAMEWORK OF CELL-MEMBRANE IN PLANTS.\r\n\r\n                              1800-1840.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no sharp line of division between the 18th and the 19th\r\ncenturies; the phytotomists who appear on the scene during the first\r\nyears of the new century are scarcely more successful than Hedwig and\r\nWolff; careful and judicious interpretation of their own and others’\r\nobservations is still rare, and they are often misled by preconceived\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nIn one respect indeed a very great improvement appeared with the\r\ncommencement of the 19th century; the number of phytotomists working\r\ncontemporaneously, checking and criticising one another, became all at\r\nonce much larger. Hitherto ten or twenty years had intervened between\r\nevery two works on phytotomy; but in the course of the twelve years\r\nafter 1800 nearly as many publications followed one another, and\r\nscientific discussion enlivened enquiry. Now we meet with a Frenchman\r\nfor the first time in the field of phytotomy, Brisseau Mirbel, who\r\nbrought out his ‘Traité d’Anatomie et de Physiologie Végétale’ in 1802,\r\nand raised a series of questions in the discussion of which several\r\nGerman botanists, Kurt Sprengel (1802), Bernhardi (1805), Treviranus\r\n(1806), Link and Rudolphi (1807), at once took part. It was a step\r\nin advance and one affecting all botanical studies, that with the\r\nexception of Rudolphi all these men, like Hedwig before them, were\r\nbotanists by profession; it was at last felt that the examination\r\nof the internal structure of plants, as well as the describing them\r\naccording to Linnaean patterns, was a part of botanical enquiry; it is\r\nat the same time true that the botanical knowledge of these observers\r\nwas often of service to them in their phytotomical investigations, and\r\ndirected their work decidedly and from the first towards that which\r\nwas worth knowing, and towards the objects which claimed the first\r\nattention. This remark applies to the younger Moldenhawer even more\r\nthan to the botanists above-named; his ‘Beiträge,’ published in 1812,\r\nmay be taken as closing the first section of this century, during\r\nwhich time he improved the methods of observation, compared his own\r\nobservations and those of others with great acuteness of judgment, and\r\ndid all that could be expected with the microscopes of the time.\r\n\r\nThe period of sixteen years after Moldenhawer, from 1812 to 1828, has\r\nnothing of material importance to show in phytotomy. On the other\r\nhand, it produced a series of the most important improvements that the\r\ncompound microscope has undergone since its invention.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1784 Aepinus had produced objectives of flint and crown\r\nglass, and in 1807 Van Deyl[72] made similar ones with two achromatic\r\nlenses, and still the phytotomists complained of the condition of their\r\ninstruments. Their figures show that they could not see clearly with\r\nthem, though the magnifying powers were not high; Link says expressly\r\nin the preface to his prize-essay of 1807, that he usually observed\r\nwith a lens that magnified a hundred and eighty times. Moldenhawer\r\nin 1812 gives the preference over all the microscopes he had used\r\nto one by Wright, which was serviceable with a magnifying power of\r\nfour hundred times, while the German instruments, especially those by\r\nWeickert, could not be used with higher powers than from one hundred\r\nand seventy to three hundred.\r\n\r\nA certain interval elapsed each time between an improvement in the\r\ninstrument and the appearance of the advantages which phytotomy derived\r\nfrom it; thus in 1824, Selligue exhibited to the Academy of Paris an\r\nexcellent microscope with double lenses, several of which could be\r\nscrewed on one over the other, and which could be used with ordinary\r\ndaylight and a magnifying power of five hundred times; in 1827 Amici\r\nmade the first achromatic and aplanatic objectives with three double\r\nlenses screwed on one over the other, the flat sides being turned\r\nto the object. And yet still in 1836 a practised phytotomist like\r\nMeyen spoke with disapproval of the instruments of his time, and gave\r\nthe preference to an old English microscope by James Man, though he\r\nallowed that the newest instruments by Ploessl were a little better.\r\nIn his work on phytotomy, which appeared in 1830, all the figures were\r\nmagnified two hundred and twenty times, as were the very beautiful\r\nfigures in his prize essay of 1836; but in his ‘Neues System’ (1837),\r\nhe had already adopted powers that magnified to over five hundred\r\ntimes. How rapid the progress was in the years before and after 1830 is\r\nshown by comparing von Mohl’s work on climbing plants of 1827 and its\r\nantiquated illustrations, with his publications of 1831 and 1833, where\r\nthe figures have a thoroughly modern appearance.\r\n\r\nThe art also of preparing anatomical objects rose by degrees with the\r\nimprovement of the microscope. It was not in a very advanced state at\r\nthe beginning of the century, if we judge by the language of writers\r\nand by their figures. It was a great step in advance when the younger\r\nMoldenhawer in 1812 isolated cells by maceration and decay in water,\r\nand was thus enabled to view cells and vessels on every side and in a\r\nperfect condition, to see their real shape, and to survey the manner of\r\ntheir combination more exactly than had hitherto been done. But even\r\nMoldenhawer still made the mistake of submitting delicate microscopic\r\nobjects to observation in a dry state, though Rudolphi and Link in 1807\r\nhad urged the advisability of keeping every part of the preparations\r\nmoist, especially the surface towards the object-glass, which shows\r\nthat they did not then use covering glasses. Nor was sufficient\r\nattention shown to the use of sharp knives of suitable form, such as\r\nthe razor, which is now almost exclusively employed, or to practice\r\nin making transverse and longitudinal sections of the utmost possible\r\ndelicacy,—two things which, through the example of Meyen’s and von\r\nMohl’s practice, were afterwards recognised as indispensable helps to\r\nphytotomy; even in their time observers were satisfied with crushing\r\nand picking their preparations to pieces.\r\n\r\nDrawing from the microscope kept even pace on the whole with increasing\r\nskill in making preparations, and with the improvement of the\r\ninstrument. If we compare together the drawings of Mirbel and Kurt\r\nSprengel in the beginning of the century, those of Link and Treviranus\r\nin 1807, Moldenhawer’s in 1812, and Meyen’s and von Mohl’s from\r\n1827 to 1840, we shall obtain a rapid and instructive survey of the\r\nhistory of phytotomy during this period of forty years. The figures\r\ntestify at once to constant increase in the magnifying powers, to\r\nthe greater clearness of the field of sight, and still more to the\r\nconstant improvement in the arts of preparing and observing objects.\r\nBut a curious misconception crept in among the phytotomists at this\r\ntime; they believed that more correct and trustworthy figures would be\r\nobtained, if the observer and writer did not himself make them, but\r\nemployed other eyes and other hands for that purpose; they imagined\r\nthat in this way every kind of prejudice, of preconceived opinion would\r\nbe eliminated from the drawings. Thus both Mirbel and Moldenhawer had\r\ntheir figures drawn by a woman, and many later phytotomists entrusted\r\nthe execution of their drawings to hired draughtsmen, as Leeuwenhoek\r\nhad done before them. A drawing from the microscope, like every\r\nother copy of an object in natural history, cannot pretend to take\r\nthe place of the object itself, but is intended to give an exact and\r\nclear rendering of what the observer has perceived, and by so doing\r\nillustrate the verbal description. The drawing will be perfect in\r\nproportion to the practised skill of the eye that observes and of the\r\nmind that interprets the forms. The copy should only show to another\r\nperson what has passed through the mind of the observer, for then\r\nonly can it serve the purpose of a mutual understanding. There is\r\nalso another point to be considered; it is exactly in the process of\r\ndrawing a microscopic object that the eye is compelled to dwell on\r\nthe individual lines and points and to grasp their true connection in\r\nall dimensions of space; it will often happen that in this process\r\nrelations will be perceived, which previous careful observation\r\nhad disregarded, and which may be decisive of the question under\r\nexamination or even open up new ones. As the microscope trains the\r\neye to scientific sight, so the careful drawing of objects makes the\r\neducated eye become the watchful adviser of the investigating mind;\r\nbut this advantage is lost to the observer who has his drawings made\r\nby another hand. It is not one of the least of von Mohl’s merits, that\r\nhe practised microscopic drawing under the influence of the views here\r\nindicated, and sought to make his figures no mere undigested copies of\r\nthe objects, but an expression of his own opinions about them.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that an important portion of the history\r\nof phytotomy lies between the beginning and the end of the period under\r\nconsideration. The distance between the knowledge of the structure of\r\nvegetable tissue which existed at the beginning of the century, and\r\nthat of Meyen and von Mohl on the same subject in 1840, is wonderfully\r\ngreat; in the one case an uncertain groping about among obscure\r\nideas, in the other a complete exposition of the inner architecture\r\nof the mature plant. But in spite of this great difference between\r\nbeginning and end, it is better to review the efforts of this period\r\nof forty years as a connected process of historical development, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the interval between the appearance of Moldenhawer’s\r\ncontributions in 1812 and Meyen’s and von Mohl’s labours about 1840, to\r\nconsider the latter as the settlement of the questions taken up at the\r\ncommencement of the century. Moreover after 1840, with the appearance\r\nof Schleiden and Nägeli on the scene, new points of view were suddenly\r\ndisclosed, and new aims were proposed in phytotomic investigation; it\r\nis no objection to this view of the subject, that the most productive\r\nportion of von Mohl’s labours falls in the succeeding twenty years, and\r\nthat during this later period his position is one of equal authority\r\nwith the new tendency and of participation in it. Up to 1845 his\r\ndiscoveries were the culminating point of the older phytotomy; they put\r\nthe finishing stroke to the work which Mirbel, Link, Treviranus, and\r\nMoldenhawer had begun. The object almost exclusively pursued during\r\nall this period was to frame as true a scheme as possible of the inner\r\nstructure of the mature organs of the plant; it was requisite to\r\ngain a right understanding of the diversities of cells and forms of\r\ntissues, to classify them and supply them with names, and to secure\r\nwell-conceived definitions of these names. Hence almost exclusive\r\nattention was paid to the configuration of the solid framework of\r\ncell-membrane, and of this chiefly in the matured state, to the form\r\nof the several elementary organs and their combination in the tissue,\r\nto the sculpture of the wall-surfaces, and to the connection of\r\ncell-spaces by pores or their separation by closed walls. There was\r\nmuch discussion, especially at first, on the contents of vessels and\r\ncells, and on supposed movements of sap in connection with anatomical\r\nresearch, but there was no careful connected investigation of the\r\ncell-contents; it was not yet recognised that the true living body of\r\nthe vegetable cell is only a definite part of the contents inclosed by\r\nthe cell-wall; the solid walls, the framework of the whole building,\r\nwere regarded as of primary importance in the structure of the cell.\r\nIt was not till the following period that in the light of historical\r\ndevelopment another view asserted itself, namely, that the solid\r\nframework of vegetable tissue with all its importance is yet in the\r\ngenetic sense only a secondary product of the phenomena of vegetative\r\nlife, that the true cell body, the cell-protoplasm is prior in time and\r\nin conception, and can claim the higher position.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMirbel, to whom we now return, had in 1801 laid down a theory of\r\ncell-formation which agreed in the main with that of Caspar Friedrich\r\nWolff; he supposed with Wolff that each cell-space was separated from\r\nits neighbour by a single wall, and relying on fresh observations\r\nasserted the existence of visible pores in the dividing walls of\r\nparenchyma and of vessels, and also maintained some new views on\r\nthe nature and formation of vessels. The essential points of this\r\ntheory found an opponent in Germany in the person of KURT SPRENGEL,\r\nthe well-known historian of botany, and one of the most variously\r\naccomplished botanists of his time, who had published in 1802 a work\r\nwritten in diffuse and familiar style under the title of ‘Anleitung\r\nzur Kenntniss der Gewächse.’ He relied on his own observations, but\r\nthese were evidently made with small magnifying powers, an obscure\r\nfield of sight, and indifferent preparations. The cell-tissue, says\r\nSprengel, consists of cavities of very various shape communicating with\r\none another, the dividing walls being in some places broken through\r\nand in others wanting. He took the starch-granules which he saw in the\r\nseed-leaves of beans and other plants for vesicles, which increase in\r\nsize by absorption of water and so form new tissue; but he did not\r\nexplain how we are to conceive of the growth of organs with such a mode\r\nof cell-formation. His account of the vessels is extremely obscure,\r\neven more obscure than Hedwig’s, though he has the merit of refuting\r\nthe latter’s strange theory of reconducting vessels in the epidermis;\r\nhe also suggested, though only incidentally, the happy idea that spiral\r\npassages and even vessels might arise from cell-tissue, since the\r\nyoungest parts of plants have only the latter; but he did not attempt\r\nto explain how or where the process takes place. Like Malpighi and\r\nGrew he supposed that the spiral vessels had no wall of their own,\r\nbut thought that the closely-rolled spiral threads formed a wall; the\r\nconstrictions in broad short-membered vessels he regarded as real\r\ncontractions in their substance, caused by the increased tightening of\r\nthe spiral threads through a sort of peristaltic movement,—a mistaken\r\nnotion often entertained at the beginning of the century, by Goethe\r\namong others, and connected with ideas of vital power prevalent at the\r\ntime. In the stomata, to which he gave the name still in use, Sprengel\r\nlike Grew, Gleichen, and Hedwig, saw a circular cushion instead of\r\nthe two guard-cells; but he notices the observation first made by\r\nComparetti, that the orifice closes and opens alternately, being wide\r\nopen in the morning and closed in the evening. But he considered the\r\nstomata to be organs of absorption.\r\n\r\nSprengel in enunciating his own theory of cell-formation accused\r\nMirbel of mistaking the starch-grains in the cells for the pores of\r\nthe cell-walls. On this point, so important in the doctrine of the\r\ncell and in physiology, he was followed by the three candidates for\r\nthe Göttingen prize, though Bernhardi had in 1805 defended Mirbel’s\r\nview, and had pointed out how little likely it was, that so skilful\r\nan observer as Mirbel should fall into so gross an error. BERNHARDI’S\r\nshort treatise, ‘Beobachtungen über Pflanzengefässe,’ Erfurt\r\n(1805[73]), was in general distinguished by a variety of new and\r\ncorrect observations, and was the work of a simple and straightforward\r\nunderstanding, which takes things as they are presented to the eye\r\nwithout allowing itself to be led astray by preconceived opinions. His\r\nobservations are certainly the best in the whole period from Malpighi\r\nand Grew to the younger Moldenhawer; his method of dealing with\r\nquestions of phytotomy is much more to the purpose than that of the\r\nthree rivals for the Göttingen prize.\r\n\r\nIn the work just mentioned Bernhardi treats of other forms of tissue as\r\nwell as vessels, and endeavours to distinguish and classify them more\r\nexactly than had hitherto been done. He contrasts favourably with his\r\ncontemporaries in the fact, that he sought to define the histological\r\nterms employed as precisely as possible,—a great step in advance at a\r\ntime when phytotomic conceptions were in a very misty condition. He\r\ndistinguishes three chief forms of vegetable tissue, pith, bast, and\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nBy pith he means the tissue which Grew had named parenchyma, and\r\nwhich is still so called; it remained a question with him whether the\r\ncells of the pith are pierced by visible pores. By the word bast he\r\nunderstood not only the fibrous elements of the rind, but those of the\r\nwood also, and in general what is now known as prosenchyma; this agrees\r\nvery well with Malpighi’s view, which was adopted by Bernhardi and by\r\nall his contemporaries, that the inner layers of the bast are changed\r\ninto the exterior layers of wood to make the increase in thickness of\r\nthe woody stem; but he did not admit the same origin in the case of the\r\ninnermost portion of the wood, for this is formed from the first in the\r\nyoung shoots, which alone contain true spiral vessels with threads that\r\nmay be wound off.\r\n\r\nBernhardi distinguishes vessels into two main groups, air-vessels and\r\nvessels properly so called. He calls the first group air-vessels for\r\nthe same reason that led Grew to give them that name, namely, that they\r\nare filled with air during a part at least of the period of vegetation;\r\nthey are found in the wood, and, where there is no closed woody body,\r\nthere the woody bundles are formed both of vessels and also of bast\r\nstrands which enclose vascular canals. These latter he next divides\r\ninto three chief kinds; annular vessels, which he was the first to\r\ndiscover, true spiral vessels with a band which can be unwound, and\r\nscalariform vessels, by which term he understood not only those with\r\nbroad slits, such as are found in Ferns, but also the pitted vessels in\r\nsecondary wood. His idea of annular and spiral vessels was perfectly\r\ncorrect, and he mentions Hedwig’s notion already described, and shows\r\nthat its exact opposite is true, namely, that the spiral band is\r\nsurrounded by a membrane on the outside,—a fact which was afterwards\r\ndenied by Link, Sprengel, and Moldenhawer. On the other hand he did\r\nnot understand the sculpturing on the scalariform vessels; he took the\r\npits in the dotted vessels for thickenings of the wall, such as are\r\nseen in the transverse ridges between the slits in true scalariform\r\nvessels, and the slits he thought were closed. If there was much that\r\nwas erroneous in these views, yet Bernhardi contributed essentially\r\nto the clearing up of the subject by his effort to distinguish the\r\ndifferent forms of air-vessels, and especially by pointing attention to\r\nthe fact that neither spiral nor annular vessels are found in secondary\r\nwood. The resemblance between different forms of vessels misled many of\r\nhis contemporaries into supposing that they are due to metamorphosis\r\nof true spiral vessels. Bernhardi showed that different forms of wall\r\nare found inside one vascular tube, but that this does not depend on\r\nmodification with age; observation rather teaches that every kind of\r\nvessel receives its character in its young state, and especially that\r\nthe youngest scalariform vessels do not present the form of spiral\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of vessels proper he reckoned all tubular forms filled\r\nwith a peculiar juice, milk-cells and true milk-vessels, and also\r\nresin-ducts and the like, and he made many good and still valuable\r\nobservations on their distribution and sap-contents. He could not see\r\nthe differences of structure in these various fluid-conveying vessels\r\nwith the low magnifying power of his glass, and therefore attended\r\nchiefly to the structure of the large resin-ducts, which on the whole\r\nhe rightly understood.\r\n\r\nThe question whether there are any other forms of vessels in the plant\r\nbeside those already named gave him occasion to define a vessel better\r\nthan it had yet been defined, namely as an uninterrupted tube or canal,\r\nand at the same time he found himself obliged to consider whether his\r\nbast-threads are vessels; but he did not give a decided answer to the\r\nquestion. He declared however distinctly against Hedwig’s reconducting\r\nvessels in the epidermis, as Sprengel had done, and it is worthy of\r\nrecognition that he understood the true nature of the corners where\r\nthree longitudinal walls of the parenchyma meet, while later observers\r\nfound difficulties in them.\r\n\r\nBefore the appearance of Bernhardi’s work the Royal scientific Society\r\nof Göttingen proposed a subject for a prize in the year 1804, which\r\nshows very plainly what uncertainty was felt at that time on all\r\npoints of phytotomy. For this reason it will be well to give it at\r\nlength from the preface to Rudolphi’s ‘Anatomie der Pflanzen’ (1807):\r\n‘Since some modern physiologists deny the peculiar construction of\r\nvessels in plants which is attributed to them by other and especially\r\nthe older observers, it would be well to institute new microscopical\r\ninvestigations, which shall either confirm the observations of\r\nMalpighi, Grew, Du Hamel, Mustel, and Hedwig, or prove that plants\r\nhave a special organisation of their own which is more simple than\r\nthat of animals, whether that organisation is supposed to originate\r\nin simple peculiar fibres and threads (Medicus) or with cellular and\r\ntubular tissue (tissu tubulaire of Mirbel). Attention should also be\r\ngiven to the following subordinate questions: 1. How many kinds of\r\nvessels may certainly be distinguished from the first period of their\r\ndevelopment? The existence of certain forms having been established; 2.\r\nAre the twisted fibres which are called spiral vessels (vasa spiralia)\r\nthemselves hollow, and do they therefore form vessels, or do they\r\nserve by their convolutions for the formation of closed cavities,\r\nand how? 3. Do fluids as well as gases move in these cavities? 4. Do\r\nthe scalariform ducts arise from adherence of the twisted threads\r\n(Sprengel), or do the threads owe their origin to the ducts (Mirbel)?\r\nDo alburnum and woody fibres originate in the scalariform ducts, or in\r\ntrue vessels, or in tubular tissue?’\r\n\r\nWe see in this case as in many similar ones, that the subject was\r\nproposed by persons who understood little of it, and who were unable\r\nto judge of what had been written about it; how else could they have\r\nplaced the opinions of a Mustel and a Medicus side by side with those\r\nof Malpighi and Grew? Had Bernhardi or Mirbel set the question, it\r\nwould certainly have been better conceived. It was in keeping that\r\nthe three essays sent in, all inferior to Bernhardi’s work already\r\nmentioned, though they contradicted one another on the most important\r\npoints, were nevertheless all accepted; not less so that Treviranus’\r\nessay obtained only the second place, though it was decidedly better\r\nthan the other two, and very much better than Rudolphi’s. The best\r\nresult of the whole affair was that it stirred up the phytotomists\r\nof the day, and led Mirbel to submit the three prize treatises to a\r\nsearching criticism, especially that of Treviranus, which Mirbel with\r\nprofessional acumen recognised as the best. Link’s essay appeared\r\nin 1807 under the title ‘Grundlehren der Anatomie und Physiologie\r\nder Pflanzen,’ that of Rudolphi as ‘Anatomie der Pflanzen,’ also in\r\n1807, each forming a handsome octavo volume. The work of Treviranus\r\nhad already appeared in 1806 with the title, ‘Vom inwendigen Bau der\r\nGewächse.’\r\n\r\nIf we compare the works of Link and Rudolphi[74], which both received\r\na prize, and which had all the appearance of text-books of general\r\nvegetable phytotomy and physiology, we miss in both any clear\r\nexposition of the conceptions connected with the words used, and the\r\ntrain of thought therefore is constantly obscure and vacillating.\r\nYet it is easy to see that they are opposed to one another in all\r\nessential points, Link[75] generally hitting on the correct, or at\r\nleast the correcter view. For instance, Rudolphi denies altogether the\r\nvegetable nature of Fungi and Lichens, because he finds no resemblance\r\nbetween their hyphae and vegetable cell-tissue, and he supposes them\r\nto arise by spontaneous generation; even of the Confervae he says that\r\nthe microscope has shown him nothing that agrees with the structure\r\nof plants,—evidently a sign of bad observation or of incapacity to\r\nunderstand what he saw. Link on the other hand regards all Thallophytes\r\nas plants, and sees that the filaments of Lichens and Fungi consist of\r\ncells, and that cells occur at least in many Algae. Rudolphi praises\r\nin the same breath the views of Wolff and Sprengel on cell-tissue,\r\nalthough they are directly opposed to one another, and although he\r\nadopts Sprengel’s strange theory of cell-formation without alteration.\r\nLink on the contrary declares against Sprengel’s theory, and on good\r\ngrounds, and shows that the vesicles which Sprengel took for young\r\ncells are starch-grains; at the same time he makes new cells be formed\r\nbetween the old ones. Rudolphi is of opinion that cells open into one\r\nanother, as is plainly shown by the passage of coloured fluids. Link\r\nmaintains that cells are closed bodies, and proves it well by the\r\noccurrence of cells with coloured juice in the middle of colourless\r\ntissue. Rudolphi represents the orifices of the stomata as encircled\r\nby a roundish rim, which he takes without hesitation for a closing\r\nmuscle because the apertures enlarge and diminish. Link is more happy\r\nin taking the part that surrounds the aperture for a cell, or a group\r\nof cells. Rudolphi considers the great cavities in hollow stems and in\r\nthe tissue of water-plants as the only air-passages in plants; Link\r\nexplains these cavities as gaps caused by the irregular growth of\r\ncellular tissue. With Rudolphi the word vessel means not only vascular\r\nforms in wood, but milk-vessels and resin-ducts also, and to the former\r\nhe even transfers Malpighi’s view of the structure of spiral vessels.\r\nLink designates the tubes of the wood only as vessels, combining the\r\nmost various forms of them under the term spiral vessels; he excludes\r\nmilk-vessels, resin-ducts, and the like from the conception of a\r\nvessel, and in this he is somewhat inconsistent, since he assumes with\r\nRudolphi that a vessel, in plants as in animals, is a canal for the\r\nconveyance of nutrient sap.\r\n\r\nWith all these contradictions, the two essays agree in adopting the\r\nold Malpighian view of the growth in thickness of stems, according to\r\nwhich the new layers of wood are formed from the inner layers of bast,\r\nwhile between the bast-cells, which are here taken to be identical with\r\nwoody fibre, new spiral vessels arise contemporaneously, and, as Link\r\nexpressly says, from juices which pour out between the bast-cells.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to understand how two treatises, so contradictory as\r\nthey have been shown to be, could have both received a prize at the\r\nsame time, or how the great difference could have been overlooked\r\nbetween Link’s sensible and well-arranged account of his subject, and\r\nRudolphi’s uncritical statements, which everywhere rely more on old\r\nauthority than on his own observation. It is however certain that\r\nLink’s better production is inferior to Bernhardi’s treatise, unless\r\nwe choose to consider the greater copiousness of detail in Link, the\r\nnumber of his observations, and his acquaintance with the literature\r\nof the subject, as giving him the advantage. His figures, as well as\r\nRudolphi’s, are not so good as those of Bernhardi.\r\n\r\nThe work of TREVIRANUS[76], to which the judges at Göttingen awarded\r\nthe second place, is much less comprehensive than those of his\r\ncompetitors; the style is inferior to Link’s, and may even be called\r\nclumsy. But the much better figures show at once that Treviranus was\r\nthe more accurate observer, and his work, in spite of the inferiority\r\nof its style, is of far higher value on account of the attention paid\r\nin it to the history of development; Treviranus laid greater stress on\r\nthis method than either Link or Rudolphi, and it led him to form views\r\non some of the fundamental questions of phytotomy, in which we see the\r\ngerms of theories afterwards perfected by von Mohl. His account of the\r\nformation of cell-tissue is mainly that of Sprengel, and therefore an\r\nunfortunate one; but nevertheless his observations on the composition\r\nof wood and the nature of vessels were as good and correct as could\r\nbe expected from the condition of the microscope at the time. He made\r\none discovery of considerable value, that of the intercellular spaces\r\nin parenchyma, but he lessened its merit by filling these passages\r\nwith sap, and even describing its movement. Woody fibres are due, he\r\nthinks, to strong longitudinal extension of vesicles. He supported\r\nBernhardi’s view of the nature of vessels, that the separable spiral\r\nthreads of spiral vessels are not wound round a membranous tube but\r\nare surrounded by one. He maintains against Bernhardi the distinctness\r\nof punctated vessels or porous woody tubes from false tracheae or\r\nscalariform vessels, while he gave a more correct description of the\r\nlatter as they occur in Ferns. He rejected Mirbel’s view that the pits\r\nin dotted vessels are depressions surrounded by a raised glandular\r\nedge, and explained them as grains or little spheres. Against this\r\nmistake we may set off the very important step which he made in\r\nadvance, when he not only conjectured that the pitted vessels of the\r\nwood are formed from cells previously divided off from one another,\r\nbut proved by observation that the members composing such vessels are\r\nat first actually separated by oblique cross-walls, which afterwards\r\ndisappear. But this correct observation was impaired by the mistaken\r\nidea, which Treviranus shared with his predecessors, that the wood\r\nis the result of transformation of the bast, and consequently that\r\nthe vessels of the wood are bast-fibres, which elongate considerably\r\nafter they are arranged in a direct chain one after the other; the\r\nunevennesses caused by the oblique junctions of the tissue gradually\r\ndisappear, the boundaries of each member of a vessel being still for\r\nsome time indicated by oblique transverse markings. The dividing\r\nwalls originally existing at these points disappear by widening of\r\nthe cavities, so that the different parts come to form a continuous\r\ncanal. To illustrate the disappearance of a parting wall between two\r\nadjoining cells Treviranus aptly points, somewhat to our surprise, to\r\nthe formation of the conjugating tube in Spirogyra. He rejects with\r\nBernhardi the view represented by Sprengel, Link, and Rudolphi, that\r\nthe different kinds of vessels are formed from true spiral vessels;\r\nhe says that he had found the scalariform ducts in Ferns so formed in\r\ntheir earliest stage and not as spiral vessels; he thinks it highly\r\nprobable that the distinct transverse bands on false spiral vessels\r\n(scalariform ducts) and the pits of dotted vessels are formed on\r\nthe walls of membranous fibre-tubes; in like manner he derives true\r\nspiral vessels from long thin-walled cells, on whose inner surface the\r\nspiral band is formed, and well compares the members of young spiral\r\nvessels with the elaters of the Jungermannieae. Here then we find the\r\nfirst more definite indications of a theory of growth in thickness\r\nof cell-walls, which, like the theory of the origin of vessels from\r\nrows of cells, was afterwards developed by von Mohl and laid on better\r\nfoundations. At the close of the essay the histology of the Cryptogams,\r\nMonocotyledons and Dicotyledons is compared, and the subject is better\r\nand more perspicuously handled than in the corresponding chapters of\r\nhis competitors.\r\n\r\nThough Treviranus’ account of vegetable tissues was on the whole\r\nweak as far as concerns the history of development, yet MIRBEL[77]\r\nrecognised in him the most dangerous opponent of his own theory,\r\nand addressed a public letter to him and not to his other German\r\nantagonists, Sprengel, Link and Rudolphi, in defence of the views he\r\nhad formerly expressed. This letter is the first part of a larger\r\nwork which appeared in 1808, ‘Exposition et défense de ma théorie\r\nde l’organisation végétale,’ in which Mirbel endeavours to meet the\r\nobjections of his opponents with great adroitness of style and with\r\nthe results of varied rather than profound observation, and to find\r\nnew arguments for his theory of vegetable tissue; he admits that his\r\nformer treatises were in many respects faulty, but demands that his\r\ncritics should discuss his system as a whole and not take offence at\r\nsingle expressions. Mirbel’s idea of the inner structure of plants\r\nis essentially the same as that broached by Caspar Friedrich Wolff.\r\nThe first and fundamental idea is that all vegetable organisation\r\nis formed from one and the same tissue differently modified. The\r\ncell-cavities are only hollow spaces of varying form and extension in\r\nhomogeneous original matter, and have no need therefore of a system of\r\nfilaments, as Grew supposed, to hold them together. The tracheae only\r\nare an exception, which Mirbel, in striking opposition to the much\r\nmore correct view of Treviranus, considers to be narrow spirally wound\r\nlaminae, inserted into the tissue and connected with it only at the\r\ntwo ends. If it is asked how interchange of sap is effected in such\r\na cellular tissue as this, it becomes necessary to assume that the\r\nmembranous substance of plants is pierced by countless invisible pores,\r\nthrough which fluids find their way. But nature has a speedier and more\r\npowerful instrument in the larger pores, which the microscope reveals.\r\nMirbel does not discuss the question how the fluids are set in motion,\r\neasily disregarding such mechanical difficulties, as was usual in those\r\ndays, when vital power was always in reserve to be the moving agent. He\r\nwarmly repels the imputation, which Sprengel had made against him, of\r\nhaving confounded pores and granules, by appealing to his figures; he\r\nsays that he has depicted prominences on the outside of the walls of\r\nthe dotted vessels, and an orifice in each of them, which his opponents\r\nsimply never saw. The question whether these prominences lie on the\r\ninside or the outside of the walls of the vessel has no meaning, if\r\nwe suppose with Mirbel that the dividing wall is single; he is only\r\nconcerned to enquire whether the perforated projections lie on the one\r\nor on the other side of the wall. He refers Treviranus, who had denied\r\nthe presence of the pores, to his description of scalariform vessels,\r\nin which he had himself seen the slits which correspond to the pores.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with these fundamental questions Mirbel’s further account\r\nof matters of detail does not concern us here. He gave a connected\r\nview of the whole of his doctrine of tissues in the form of aphorisms,\r\nwhich occupy the second part of his book. Of all that he says on the\r\nfive kinds into which he distinguishes vessels the most interesting\r\nis the statement, that diaphragms pierced like a sieve separate the\r\ndifferent members of his ‘beaded’ vessels. We find that the weakest\r\npart of Mirbel’s phytotomy, as of that of his opponents, is his\r\ndescription of the true vessels (vasa propria), with which he classes\r\nthe milk-cells of the Euphorbiae and the resin-ducts of Coniferae, but\r\nhe saw clearly enough that the latter were canals inclosed in a layer\r\nof tissue of their own. The third part of the book is devoted to these\r\nforms of tissue, and we learn that he classes not only many kinds of\r\nsieve-cell-bundles, but also true bast-fibres, as those of nettle and\r\nhemp, with his bundles of true vessels. Like his opponents he makes\r\nthe growth in thickness in woody stems to be due to transformation of\r\nthe inner layer of bast; but he gives a new turn to this view, which\r\nbrings it nearer to the modern theory; during the period of vegetation\r\na delicate tissue with large vessels is developed in Dicotyledons on\r\nthe confines of the wood and the bark, and these augment the mass of\r\nthe woody body, while a loose cellular tissue is formed on the other\r\nside, destined to replace the constant losses of the outer rind. To\r\nlater phytotomists, who understood by the word cambium a thin layer\r\nof tissue constantly engaged in producing wood and rind, Mirbel’s\r\notherwise indistinct conception of growth in thickness must have become\r\nmore indistinct from his using the word cambium not for the layer of\r\ntissue afterwards so called, but for a highly ‘elaborated and purified\r\nsap’ which is intended for the food of the plant and makes its way\r\nthrough all membranes; we see this cambium-sap appear at the spots\r\nwhere it produces new tubes and cells after the manner of the Wolffian\r\ntheory. The cells appear at first as minute spheres, the tubes are very\r\nfine lines; both enlarge and gradually show pores, clefts, etc. This\r\nis essentially Wolff’s doctrine, which Mirbel afterwards endeavoured\r\nto confirm against his German opponents from the germination of the\r\ndate-palm with the help of a more powerful microscope.\r\n\r\nMirbel insisted more than the German phytotomists of his day on the\r\nidea, that all forms of vegetable tissue are developed originally\r\nfrom young cell-tissue, an idea suggested by Sprengel and following\r\nnaturally with Mirbel from Wolff’s theory. Both Mirbel and Wolff were\r\nhasty in observation and too much under the influence of theory in\r\ngiving reasons for what they observed, and therefore too ready with\r\nfar-reaching explanations of phenomena which only long-continued\r\nobservation could decide.\r\n\r\nTreviranus replied, though after some delay, to Mirbel’s polemics\r\nby incorporating into his ‘Beiträge zur Pflanzenphysiologie,’\r\nGöttingen (1811), an essay entitled ‘Beobachtungen im Betreff einiger\r\nstreitigen Puncte der Pflanzenphysiologie,’ in which he again took up\r\nthe questions in dispute between himself, Mirbel, Link and others,\r\nand supported his own views by fresh investigations. It cannot be\r\ndenied that in this short treatise Treviranus brought some important\r\nquestions nearer to a decision; he added materially to the knowledge\r\nof bordered pits, on which subject his views now approximated more\r\nnearly to those of Mirbel; he drew attention to the vesicular nature\r\nof vegetable cells, which are often separable from one another, and\r\nto the occurrence of true spiral vessels in the neighbourhood of the\r\npith in Conifers also, and among other things discovered the stomata on\r\nthe capsule of Mosses. On the subject of the theory of cell-formation\r\nwhich he had borrowed from Sprengel, he endeavoured to extricate\r\nhimself from his difficulty by ingeniously pointing out that though\r\nthe starch-grains in the seed-leaves of the bean disappear without\r\nproducing new cells in them, they are dissolved and then serve as fluid\r\nmaterial for new cell-formation in other parts of the germinating\r\nplant, which however was giving up Sprengel’s theory; yet he cited as a\r\ndirect proof of that theory the origination of gonidia in the cells of\r\nHydrodictyon, and their development into new nets.\r\n\r\nMirbel and his German opponents moved for the most part in a circle\r\nof ideas which had been formed by the speculations of Malpighi, Grew,\r\nHedwig and Wolff, though it must be allowed that the observations\r\nof Treviranus did open new points of view. But JOHANN JAKOB PAUL\r\nMOLDENHAWER[78] travelled far beyond these older views as early as\r\n1812 in his important work, ‘Beiträge zur Anatomie der Pflanzen.’ He\r\ntook up from the first a more independent position as regards former\r\nopinions than either of the writers hitherto considered. He relied\r\non very detailed, varied, and systematic observations evidently made\r\nwith a better instrument, abided by what he himself saw, and chose his\r\npoint of view in accordance with it, while he criticised the views\r\nof his predecessors in detail with an unmistakable superiority, and\r\nin so doing displayed minute acquaintance with the literature of the\r\nsubject and varied phytotomical experience. He fixed his eye firmly\r\non the points in question, and made each one the subject of earnest\r\ninvestigation and copious and perspicuous discussion. His figures prove\r\nthe carefulness of his examination and the greater excellence of his\r\ninstrument; they are undoubtedly the best that were produced up to\r\n1812. His mode of dealing with his subject and his figures, though they\r\nwere not executed by himself, remind us in many respects of von Mohl,\r\nthough it would be more correct to say that von Mohl’s manner reminds\r\nus of Moldenhawer, for from the great respect which von Mohl displays\r\nfor him, especially in his earlier writings, it can scarcely be doubted\r\nthat he formed himself on Moldenhawer’s ‘Beiträge,’ and first learnt\r\nfrom them the earnestness and carefulness demanded by phytotomic work.\r\n\r\nIt has been already mentioned that the study of vegetable physiology\r\nis indebted to Moldenhawer for one important practical improvement.\r\nHe was the first who isolated cells and vessels by allowing parts of\r\nplants to decay in water and afterwards crushing and dissecting them, a\r\nprocess not much used in modern times, though it may still be applied\r\nwith advantage in conjunction with what is known as Schulze’s solution,\r\nespecially if it is carried out with Moldenhawer’s carefulness and\r\ncircumspection. The isolation of the elementary organs of plants\r\nby maceration in water necessarily brought Moldenhawer into direct\r\nantagonism with Mirbel, who with Wolff assumed that the partition\r\nbetween any two cells was a single wall; whereas Moldenhawer found\r\nthat the cells and vessels were closed tubes and sacs after isolation,\r\nand must necessarily, as it would seem, so lie one against another\r\nin the living plant, that the wall between every two cell-spaces is\r\nformed of two membranous laminae, and he expressly says that this is\r\nthe case even in very thin-walled parenchyma. This result remained\r\nunassailable, so long as no one was in a position to conclude from\r\nthe history of the development of cell-tissue that the partitions\r\nare originally single, or by aid of strong magnifying power to prove\r\nthe true structure of the walls and their later separation, and the\r\ndifferentiation of the once single wall into two separable laminae.\r\nIf the view based on the results of maceration was still not the\r\ntrue view, yet it was nearer the truth as regards the matured state\r\nof the cell-wall than that of Wolff and Mirbel, and the important\r\nadvantage was gained of being able to study the form of elementary\r\norgans and the sculpture on their walls more accurately than before.\r\nIt is true that Link had occasionally isolated cells by boiling in\r\n1809, and Treviranus had drawn attention in 1811 to the fact that it\r\nwas possible to isolate parenchyma-cells in their natural condition;\r\nbut neither of them made systematic use of these observations, and\r\nto Moldenhawer belongs the exclusive merit of having first isolated\r\nvessels and woody cells; but as usually happens, he did not himself\r\nobtain all the possible results from his method of preparation. In his\r\nwork which indeed embraces the whole of phytotomy, he is continually\r\nrecurring to one species, maize. This supplies the starting-point in\r\nevery question to be discussed. The results obtained there are the\r\nfirm supports on which he leans in the examination of a great variety\r\nof plants, which he then compares together at length. This mode of\r\ntreatment was well chosen both for investigation and instruction in the\r\nexisting state of the science; it was a particularly happy idea that\r\nof choosing the maize-plant for his purpose; former phytotomists had\r\ngenerally had recourse to dicotyledonous stems, and preferred those\r\nthat had compact wood and complex rind, but the examination of these\r\nplants presents difficulties at the present day to a practised observer\r\nwith a good microscope. Occasionally observers had taken the stem of\r\nthe gourd, where the large cells and vessels suited small magnifying\r\npower, but where many abnormal conditions occurred to interfere with\r\ntheir conclusions. The Monocotyledons, like the Vascular Cryptogams,\r\nhad hitherto been comparatively neglected. When then Moldenhawer made\r\na monocotyledonous and rapidly growing plant, with very large-celled\r\ntissue and comparatively very simple structure, the chief subject of\r\nhis investigations, he was sure to succeed in making out many things\r\nmore clearly than his predecessors. It was an important point that\r\nhe found the fibrous elementary organs in this plant united with\r\nthe vessels into bundles, which are separated by a strict line of\r\ndemarcation from the large-celled parenchyma that surrounds them. Thus\r\nthe peculiar character, the idea, of the vascular bundle was brought\r\nprominently into contrast with that of other forms of tissue. This took\r\nthe place of the distinction between rind, wood, and pith, which had\r\nserved former phytotomists as the basis of their histological survey,\r\nbut which is in itself only a secondary result of the later elaboration\r\nof certain parts of the plant. Moldenhawer, in laying the chief stress\r\nfrom the first on the contrast between vascular bundles and parenchyma,\r\nhit upon a histological fact of more fundamental importance, the right\r\nappreciation of which has since enabled the phytotomist to find his way\r\nthrough the histology of the higher plants. For while the construction\r\nof Monocotyledons and Ferns must seem abnormal and quite peculiar to\r\nany one who starts with examining the rind, wood, and pith of old\r\ndicotyledonous stems, those on the contrary who, with Moldenhawer, have\r\nrecognised a special histological system in the vascular bundles of\r\nMonocotyledons, have the way opened to them to seek for a similar one\r\nin the Dicotyledons, and to refer the secondary phenomenon of wood and\r\nrind to the primary existence of vascular bundles. Moldenhawer did in\r\nfact open this way, when he showed how the growth of a dicotyledonous\r\nstem may be understood from the structure and position of the\r\noriginally isolated vascular bundles (Beiträge, p. 49, etc.). But he\r\nwas thus of necessity led to the rejection of Malpighi’s theory of the\r\ngrowth in thickness of woody stems, which all vegetable anatomists from\r\nGrew to Mirbel had adopted. Though Bernhardi and Treviranus made weak\r\nattempts to discredit it, Moldenhawer was the first who distinctly\r\nrejected the origin of the external layers of wood from the inner bast,\r\nand proposed the first really practical basis for the later and correct\r\ntheory of secondary growth in thickness (p. 35). The removal of this\r\nancient error is in itself a very important result, and one which,\r\napart from all other services, must secure him an honourable place in\r\nthe history of botany.\r\n\r\nBut the light must have its attendant shadow, and all his carefulness\r\nin observation and cautiousness in judgment did not protect him from\r\none prejudice and its evil consequences. After Moldenhawer had isolated\r\nthe elementary organs by maceration, he had to answer the question how\r\nwe are to conceive of their firm coherence in the living plant. He came\r\nto the conclusion, as did von Mohl, Schacht, and others after him,\r\nthat there must be some special connecting medium; but he did not hit\r\nupon their idea of a matrix, in which the cells are imbedded, or of a\r\ncement which holds them together, but on a much stranger theory, which\r\nreminds us at once of Grew’s thread-tissue, and like that rests partly\r\non incorrect observations. These were too hastily accepted as the basis\r\nof a theory which in its turn interfered with after observations. He\r\nthought that the cells and vessels were surrounded and held together\r\nby an extremely delicate network of fine fibres; in some cases he\r\nreally believed that he saw these fibres, and interpreted in this way\r\nthe thickened bands in the well-known cells of Sphagnum, and still\r\nmore strangely he appears to have taken the thickened longitudinal\r\nand transverse edges of cells and vessels for such threads. The\r\nunfavourable impression produced by this theory is necessarily\r\nheightened by the fact that he gave the name of cell-tissue, a term\r\nlong used in a different sense, to his fancy-structure of reticulated\r\nthreads which were to hold the cells and vessels together, while he\r\ncalled the parenchyma itself cellular substance, an expression which\r\nfortunately no one copied, and which certainly contributed at a later\r\ntime to discredit the great services which Moldenhawer rendered to\r\nphytotomy.\r\n\r\nHis ‘Beiträge zur Anatomie der Pflanzen’ are divided into two portions;\r\nthe first treats of the parts surrounding the spiral vessels; the\r\nsecond of the spiral vessels themselves.\r\n\r\nThe position and collective form of the component parts of the vascular\r\nbundle in the stem of the maize-plant are well described in the first\r\nsection of the work. It is correctly stated that there is a sheath to\r\nthe whole bundle composed of strongly thickened fibrous cells, that\r\neach of these cells has its own membrane and is entirely closed, and\r\nthat they resemble the bast and the fibrous elements of the wood of\r\nDicotyledons. The segmented wood-cells and the parenchyma-cells of\r\nthe wood arranged in rows are incidentally noticed. Under the name of\r\nfibrous tubes he included the cells of the sclerenchyma-sheath of many\r\nvascular bundles and the true bast and wood-fibres, which latter he\r\nsays are wanting in the Coniferae. He explained the secondary growth in\r\nthickness of rind and bast by the example of the shoot of the vine, in\r\nwhich he correctly distinguished the medullary sheath and the spiral\r\nvessels. In herbaceous Dicotyledons he found the bundles of vessels\r\nto consist of a bast portion and a woody portion, and he attributed\r\nthe formation of the compact wood of true woody plants to the blending\r\ntogether of the woody portions of these separate bundles.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the parenchymatous cell-tissue he rejects emphatically\r\nand on good grounds the origin of new cells from the granular contents\r\nof older ones, which had been the view of Sprengel and Treviranus, as\r\nalso the theory of Wolff and Mirbel, while he maintains against Mirbel\r\nespecially, that the separation of fibrous tubes is possible even\r\nwhere no dividing line can be seen between them in the cross section.\r\nHe considers that both in thin-walled and thick-walled parenchyma\r\nthe dividing wall is double and the cell-membrane entirely closed.\r\n‘It appears,’ he continues on p. 86, ‘from these observations that\r\ncellular substance consists of separate closed tubes, which may be\r\nround or oval, or more or less elongated, or almost cylindrical in\r\nshape, and these by mutual pressure assume an angular and flattened\r\nform, which is either regular like the cells of the comb of bees or\r\nmore or less irregular. Such an aggregate of separate cells (and here\r\nhe is certainly quite right) has nothing in common with a tissue,\r\nand the word cell-tissue seems therefore less suitable than the term\r\ncellular substance, composed of cell-like tubes.’ Further on he\r\nrejects Mirbel’s idea of the existence of visible holes in the walls\r\nof cells, and points out that they are not necessary for the movement\r\nof sap. The dispute between Mirbel and his opponents respecting the\r\nporousness of cell-walls was extended at the same time to the stomata\r\nof the epidermis[79], the slits in them being supposed to be apertures\r\nin the epidermis regarded as a simple membrane. Moldenhawer took\r\noccasion to examine the anatomy of stomata more closely, and produced\r\nthe first accurate descriptions and figures of these organs, showing\r\nespecially that the apertures are not surrounded by a simple border,\r\nas most previous observers believed, but lie between two cells, and\r\nthat therefore they are not examples of the existence of pores in\r\ncell-walls, as Mirbel imagined. It may be observed here by the way,\r\nthat Mirbel afterwards considered stomata to be short broad hairs;\r\nAmici in 1824, Treviranus in 1821, demonstrated their true structure\r\nby cross sections, and von Mohl at a later period investigated it\r\nthoroughly. Moldenhawer on the present occasion also enquired into\r\nthe faculty attributed to stomata of opening and closing alternately,\r\nwhich, first observed by Comparetti, was then much discussed by\r\nthe German phytotomists, and has been made the subject of repeated\r\ninvestigation in modern times. The whole of this discussion was in\r\nconnection with the question of the pitting of cell-walls, the true\r\nnature of which Moldenhawer however never clearly understood.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar vessels, known as ‘vasa propria,’ were a stone of\r\nstumbling to Moldenhawer, as they were to his predecessors and to many\r\nof his successors, because misled by the resemblance in their contents\r\nhe included under this name forms of very different kinds. A very good\r\ndescription of the soft bast in the vascular bundle of the maize-plant\r\nis followed by a notice of the milk-tubes of Musa, the milk-cells\r\nof Asclepias which he explains incorrectly, and the milk-vessels of\r\nChelidonium which he understood better. All these ‘vasa propria’ he\r\ntook for cellular vessels, formed of tubes opening into one another;\r\nbut he clearly distinguished the turpentine-ducts from them, and has\r\ngiven a correct figure of such a duct from the pine, though he assumes\r\nthe existence of a special membrane lying inside the cell-rows which\r\nsurround it, and lining the passage. Finally he passes on to the\r\nintercellular spaces, which he considers to be gaps in the cellular\r\nsubstance, and illustrates by Musa and Nymphaea. He does not notice\r\nparticularly the narrow interstices which Treviranus had observed\r\ntraversing the parenchyma.\r\n\r\nIn the second portion of his work he includes all the vessels found in\r\nthe vascular bundle of the maize-plant under the term spiral vessels,\r\nbut he distinguishes the different forms of them well, and especially\r\npoints out that rings and spirals appear on one and the same vascular\r\ntube in different parts of its course, as Bernhardi had already\r\nshown. The isolating of the vessels gave him a better opportunity of\r\nseeing how they are made up of portions of different lengths than his\r\npredecessors had enjoyed, and he proves at some length the existence of\r\na thin closed membrane forming the vessel, but like Hedwig he places\r\nthe thickenings on the outside. He as little overcame the difficulties\r\nof bordered pits as did von Mohl and Schleiden after him. In this case\r\nas in others, it was the history of development which first taught the\r\ntrue nature of these formations (Schacht, 1860).\r\n\r\nIt was mentioned in the Introduction that Moldenhawer may be said to\r\nclose the first portion of the period from 1800 to 1840, not only\r\nbecause the majority of the questions ventilated up to that time were\r\nto a certain extent settled by him, but also because there is no\r\nmaterial advance in phytotomy to be recorded for several years after\r\nthe publication of his work in 1812. It is true that Kieser in his\r\n‘Grundzüge der Anatomie der Pflanzen’ (1815) attempted a connected\r\nexposition of the whole subject, but his book offers nothing really\r\nnew, being merely a playing with the unmeaning phrases of the current\r\nnature-philosophy, while it revived gross errors like Hedwig’s doctrine\r\nof the presence of lymphatic vessels in the tissue of the epidermis,\r\nand made the Mosses consist of conferva-threads. Phytotomy was on the\r\ncontrary really enriched by the miscellaneous works of Treviranus\r\npublished in 1821, especially in respect to questions connected with\r\nthe epidermis, and by Amici’s discovery in 1823, that the intercellular\r\nspaces in plants contain not sap but air, and that the vessels too\r\nchiefly convey air. We may quietly pass over the later writings of\r\nMirbel, Schulze, Link, Turpin and others, which appeared after 1812\r\nand before 1830, as our business is not so much with an account of the\r\nliterature of the subject as with evidence of real advance.\r\n\r\nMeyen and von Mohl may be said to have commenced their labours with\r\n1830, and in the course of the succeeding ten years they became the\r\nchief authorities on phytotomy, though a highly meritorious work of\r\nMirbel’s on Marchantia polymorpha and the formation of pollen in\r\nCucurbita falls as late as 1835. We may even pass over so elaborate a\r\nwork as the ‘Physiologie der Gewächse’ of Treviranus (1835-1838), which\r\nembraces also the whole of phytotomy, because though its treatment of\r\nsome of the details is good, it presents its subject virtually from\r\nthe points of view opened before 1812. This work, though it neglects\r\nno part of its subject and contains much useful reference to the works\r\nof other observers, was unfortunately out of date at the time of its\r\nappearance, for owing to von Mohl’s labours an entirely new spirit had\r\nentered since 1828 into the treatment of phytotomy.\r\n\r\nThough Meyen and von Mohl must be regarded as the chief representatives\r\nof phytotomy from 1830 to 1840, yet they are men of very different\r\nimportance in the science. The essential difference between them cannot\r\nperhaps be better shown than by pointing to the fact, that Meyen’s\r\nlabours cannot at present claim more than a historical interest, while\r\nvon Mohl’s earliest investigations between 1828 and 1840, so far from\r\nbeing obsolete, are the sources of our present knowledge, and from\r\nthem every one must still draw who proposes to cultivate any portion\r\nof phytotomy. Meyen’s views, in spite of the many investigations which\r\nhe made himself, are entirely confined within the circle of thought\r\nrepresented by the Göttingen essayists, though in his observations he\r\nwent beyond them, and even beyond Moldenhawer; but the phytotomical\r\nviews of these men were from the first no law to von Mohl; he took\r\nup an entirely independent position at once with respect even to\r\nMoldenhawer and Treviranus, though a longer time certainly elapsed,\r\nbefore he succeeded in freeing himself wholly from Mirbel’s authority.\r\nFor these reasons, and because Meyen’s work was interrupted by his\r\ndeath so early as 1840, while von Mohl aided to advance phytotomy for\r\nanother thirty years, we will speak first of Meyen’s labours in that\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nMEYEN[80] is remarkable for the extraordinary number of his written\r\nproductions. In 1826, at the early age of twenty-two, he wrote his\r\ntreatise ‘De primis vitae phenomenis in fluidis’; two years later he\r\npublished researches anatomical and physiological into the contents of\r\nvegetable cells, and in 1830 appeared his ‘Lehrbuch der Phytotomie,’\r\nfounded on his own investigations in every branch of the subject, with\r\nmany figures on thirteen copper plates very beautifully executed for\r\nthe time. His industry as a writer was then interrupted by a voyage\r\nround the world made in the years 1830-1832, but was again marvellously\r\nproductive during the last four years of his life (1836-1840); it\r\nis difficult to conceive how he found time even for the mechanical\r\npart of his work, for in 1836 he published his treatise on the latest\r\nadvances in vegetable anatomy and physiology, a quarto volume of 319\r\npages with twenty-two plates, which gained the prize from the Teyler\r\nsociety in Haarlem; the figures are well drawn, the style is that of a\r\npractised writer, but the matter of the work is somewhat superficially\r\nhandled. A year later (1837) appeared the first volume of his ‘Neues\r\nSystem der Pflanzenphysiologie,’ and two more volumes by the year\r\n1839,—a work also rich in new observations and figures. In the course\r\nof the same years (1836-39) he wrote detailed annual reports of the\r\nresults of investigations in the field of physiological botany, which\r\nfill a portly volume, and published in 1837 a prize-essay on the\r\norgans of secretion, and in 1836 a sketch of the geography of plants;\r\nin 1840 appeared a treatise on fructification and polyembryony, and a\r\nposthumous work on vegetable pathology in 1841. The number of works\r\nthus given to the world between the years 1836 and 1840, though partly\r\nprepared before that period, is so unprecedented, that it is impossible\r\nfor the composer to have maturely meditated his facts or their inner\r\nconnection, and the study of his writings shows that he was often\r\ntoo hasty in propounding new views, and in rejecting or accepting\r\nthe statements of others. The style is perspicuous and flowing, and\r\nanimated by a genuine scientific spirit; but the expressions are often\r\ninexact, the ideas not unfrequently immature, and points of fundamental\r\nimportance are sometimes neglected for unimportant and secondary\r\nmatters. These faults are the result of hasty production; we must\r\nset against them conspicuous merits; Meyen had an eye open to every\r\nquestion in phytotomy and left nothing unnoticed, while he made it his\r\nconstant aim to give clear general views of his subject as a connected\r\nwhole, and enable his reader to see his way in every direction, in\r\norder to make phytotomy and vegetable physiology accessible to wider\r\ncircles of scientific men; the like praise is due to his drawings from\r\nthe microscope which are beautifully executed; they present to the\r\nreader not the small fragments of earlier phytotomic works but whole\r\nmasses of tissue so connected together, that it is possible to gain\r\nsome insight into the disposition of the different systems of tissue\r\nand their mutual relations. The superiority of Meyen’s drawings of\r\n1836 as compared with those of 1830 is very striking, though he used\r\nthe same microscope in both cases and the same magnifying power of two\r\nhundred and twenty times.\r\n\r\nTo learn what were Meyen’s independent contributions to the advance\r\nof phytotomy, we must turn to his ‘Phytotomie’ of 1830; for in his\r\nlater works and especially in the ‘Neues System der Physiologie’ of\r\n1837 he was able to avail himself of von Mohl’s earliest and searching\r\ninvestigations; these necessarily influenced his views, though he\r\nalways assumed the character of a rival and opponent of von Mohl,\r\nand treated not only Treviranus and Link, but even Kieser and men of\r\nhis stamp, as entitled to equal rank with him. And as in his later\r\nwritings he was reluctant to acknowledge von Mohl’s services to science\r\nand overlooked their fundamental importance, so in his earlier work\r\nin 1830 he often appears as an assailant of Moldenhawer and tries to\r\nset up Link’s authority against him; we find to our astonishment in\r\nthe first volume of the ‘Neues System’ a dedication to Link as the\r\n‘founder of German vegetable physiology.’ The position of a scientific\r\nman in relation to his science as a whole is certainly most simply and\r\nclearly defined by his judgment on the merits of his contemporaries\r\nand predecessors, and we may conclude from what has now been said that\r\nMeyen moved within the circle of ideas of the Göttingen prize-essays,\r\nand did not clearly see the importance of the points of view opened by\r\nMoldenhawer and von Mohl; though it must always be allowed that Meyen\r\nworking independently far outstripped Link on his own path.\r\n\r\nIf it was our purpose to write a biography of Meyen, we should have to\r\ngo through his works, and show the steps by which his views arrived at\r\nclearness and precision; it is sufficient in this history to show what\r\nwas peculiar and original in his general conception of the problems of\r\nphytotomy. This appears most plainly in the ‘Phytotomie’ of 1830; and\r\nwe may base our historical survey on that work because its views are in\r\nthe main those of the first volume of the ‘Neues System’ which appeared\r\nseven years later, and still more because a detailed examination of the\r\nlater publication would involve us in a lengthy discussion on Meyen’s\r\nscientific relation to von Mohl. It is less important in this place\r\nto give an estimate of Meyen’s character as a man of science than to\r\nshow, how in the year 1830, when Mohl was beginning to apply himself\r\nto phytotomy but as yet exercised no important influence on opinion,\r\nviews on the structure of plants were formed by one who gave himself up\r\nto its study with decided ability and great zeal; in this way we shall\r\ngain a standard by which to judge of the advance made chiefly by von\r\nMohl and in part by Mirbel during the succeeding ten years. In judging\r\nof Meyen’s book, we must not forget that it was written when he was\r\nonly twenty-five or twenty-six years old, and that it is under any view\r\nof it a remarkable performance for so young a man.\r\n\r\nMeyen adopted three fundamental forms of elementary organs in plants;\r\ncells, spiral tubes, and sap-vessels; systems, he says, are formed by\r\nunion of similar elementary organs; hence there is a cell-system, a\r\nspiral tube-system, and a system of sap-vessels (vascular system). We\r\nsee at once by this classification how closely he follows the ideas\r\nformed before Moldenhawer. The establishment of these three systems is\r\na retrograde step, since Moldenhawer had already clearly distinguished\r\nbetween vascular bundles and cell-tissue. Meyen then discusses each\r\nsystem at length and shows how they are grouped together. He lays\r\ngreat stress, as he did also at a later period, on the difference in\r\nthe characteristic forms of cell-tissue, for which he introduced the\r\nnames merenchyma, parenchyma, prosenchyma and pleurenchyma. These\r\nhe calls regular cell-tissue, the shapes of the cells being like\r\ngeometrical bodies, in opposition to the irregular tissue of Fuci,\r\nLichens and Fungi. It is a decided improvement on former practice,\r\nand one that marks his later works also, that in connection with the\r\nstructure of the solid cell-fabric he discusses the contents of cells\r\nin a special chapter, in which first the matter in solution, then the\r\ngranular bodies with organized structure are considered, though with\r\nthe latter he classes not only starch-grains, chlorophyll-corpuscles\r\nand the like, but also the spermatozoa in pollen-grains and layers\r\nof thickening matter projecting on the inside of cell-walls, such\r\nas the spiral bands in the elaters of Jungermannieae and several\r\nsimilar formations. He describes the crystals in vegetable cells at\r\nsome length, and finally discusses the movement of the cell-contents\r\n(‘sap’), not omitting that of rotation in the Characeae as observed\r\nby Corti, and in other water-plants. The chapter on intercellular\r\nspaces also shows considerable advance on the views which obtained in\r\n1812; Meyen calls it an account of the spaces produced in cell-tissue\r\nby the union of the cells; the true intercellular passages filled\r\nwith air are here distinguished from receptacles of secretions,\r\nresin-passages, gum-passages, oil-passages, and secretion-receptacles\r\nof the nature of cavities. The large air-passages and gaps, such as\r\noccur in water-plants, are a third form of intercellular space; his\r\nair-canals in the wood of oak filled with cell-tissue are obviously\r\nvessels filled with the substance known as thylosis. The form of the\r\ncells in the tissue he thinks is not due to mutual pressure, and he\r\nrejects Kieser’s view that the ideal fundamental form of cells must be\r\na rhombododecahedron; but he thinks there is a significant resemblance\r\nbetween the shape of cells and that of basaltic columns.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the spiral tube-system he first discusses the spiral\r\nfibre, which appears, he says, either detached between the cells or\r\ninside them as well,—an account of the matter decidedly inferior to\r\nthose of Bernhardi and Treviranus. The spiral tubes are, he says on\r\npage 225, cylindrical or conical bodies formed of spiral fibres which\r\nare afterwards surrounded by a delicate membrane. He puts annular,\r\nreticulated, and pitted vessels together as metamorphosed spiral tubes.\r\nHis explanation of these forms cannot well be understood except by\r\nsupposing that he assumed an actual metamorphosis in time in accordance\r\nwith the view of Rudolphi and Link; but he afterwards in his ‘Neues\r\nSystem,’ i. p. 140 declares this to be a misunderstanding, though his\r\nreal meaning is still doubtful; the obscurity attending the doctrine\r\nof metamorphosis did not fail to cause misunderstandings in phytotomy,\r\nas it did in the morphology of organs. Meyen makes only the striated\r\nand pitted vessels in the wood convey air, the true spiral vessels sap.\r\nThat vessels are formed from cells, as Mirbel had already maintained\r\nand Treviranus had partly observed, Meyen intimates indeed, but not\r\nwith an air of entire conviction.\r\n\r\nThe different forms of laticiferous organs are examined under the head\r\nof the ‘system of circulation in plants.’ Meyen sees in this system the\r\nhighest product of the plant, being fully persuaded with Schulz, that\r\nthe latex (milk), or as he also terms it the life-sap, is in constant\r\ncirculation, like the blood in the veins. He gives a more summary\r\naccount than is his wont of the course of the laticiferous organs, but\r\nbestows more care on the nature of the latex, and on the structure of\r\nthe receptacles that contain it. That some of these are produced by\r\ncell-fusion, that others represent intercellular spaces, while others\r\nagain are long branched cells, was not known to Meyen or even to later\r\nphytotomists before 1860.\r\n\r\nThis condensed account of the contents of Meyen’s ‘Phytotomie’ shows a\r\nstriking mixture of advance and retrogression, when compared with what\r\nhad been achieved before his time; by the side of the fact established\r\nby Treviranus that the epidermis does not consist of a single membrane\r\nbut of a layer of cells, to which Meyen assents, we find the gross\r\nmistake of taking the guard-cells of stomata for cuticular glands,\r\nthe apertures in which he considers as of secondary importance. It is\r\nstill more striking that Meyen expressly rejects on page 120 the fact\r\nestablished two years before by von Mohl that the pits of parenchyma\r\nare thinner spots, and treats the various pit-formations of the\r\ncell-wall as raised portions of the surface.\r\n\r\nIn the first volume of his later work the ‘Neues System,’ Meyen gives\r\na detailed account of phytotomy, which accords on the whole with the\r\nscheme developed in the book we have been examining, and as might\r\nbe expected he corrects many errors, adduces many new observations,\r\nand introduces us to many steps in advance of former knowledge; we\r\nshall recur to some of his later views in ensuing portions of this\r\nhistory with which they are more in connection, remarking only here,\r\nthat Meyen paid more attention to the contents of the cell than his\r\ncontemporaries, and especially made a number of observations on the\r\nstreaming movement, without however recognising the peculiar nature\r\nof the protoplasm which is its substratum. The cell-wall, which he\r\nhad once considered to be homogeneous, he afterwards believed to be\r\ncomposed of fine fibres, a view resting on correct but insufficient\r\nobservation and afterwards set right by von Mohl and Nägeli.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to imagine a more striking contrast between\r\ntwo men pursuing the same science than that between Meyen and his much\r\nmore important contemporary Hugo von Mohl; Meyen was more a writer\r\nthan an investigator; von Mohl wrote comparatively little in a long\r\ntime, and only after most careful investigation; Meyen attended more\r\nto the habit, the collective impression produced by objects seen with\r\nthe microscope, von Mohl troubled himself little about this, and\r\nalways went back to the foundation and true inner connection of the\r\nstructural relations; Meyen quickly formed his judgment, von Mohl often\r\ndelayed his even after long investigation; Meyen was not critical,\r\nthough always prone to opposition, in von Mohl the critical power\r\nmuch overweighed that of constructive thought. Meyen has not so much\r\ncontributed to the definitive settlement of important questions,\r\nas brought to light manifold phenomena, and so to speak accumulated\r\nthe raw material; von Mohl on the other hand aimed from the first at\r\npenetrating as deeply as possible into vegetable cell-structure, and\r\nemploying all the anatomical facts in framing a coherent scheme.\r\n\r\nWe have already called attention to HUGO VON MOHL’S[81] pre-eminent\r\nposition in the history both of this and also of the succeeding period.\r\nOccupying himself for the most part with phytotomical questions which\r\nhad been already investigated, he made the solid framework of cellulose\r\nthe object of special and searching examination, and completed the work\r\nof his predecessors on this subject; he thus laid a firm foundation for\r\nthe researches into the history of development afterwards undertaken\r\nby Nägeli. Von Mohl, like former phytotomists, generally connected his\r\nresearches into structural relations with physiological questions;\r\nbut there was one great and unmistakable difference; he never forgot\r\nthat the interpretation of visible structure must not be disturbed\r\nby physiological views; he used therefore his thorough physiological\r\nknowledge chiefly to give a more definite direction to his anatomical\r\nresearches, and to illustrate the connection between structure and\r\nfunction in organs. By scarcely any other phytotomist was the true\r\nrelation between physiological and anatomical research so well\r\nunderstood and turned to such practical account as by von Mohl, who was\r\nequally averse to the entire separation of phytotomy from physiology,\r\nand to the undue mixing up of the one with the other, which has led his\r\npredecessors, Meyen especially, into misconceptions.\r\n\r\nHis anatomical researches profited by his extraordinary technical\r\nknowledge of the microscope; he could himself polish and set lenses,\r\nwhich would bear comparison with the best of their time. As the\r\nmajority of botanists from 1830 to 1850 had little knowledge of\r\nthe kind, there was no one so well qualified as von Mohl to give\r\ninstruction in short treatises on the practical advantages of a\r\nparticular instrument, to remove prejudices and finally as in his\r\n‘Mikrographie’ (1846) to give detailed directions for the management of\r\nthe instrument.\r\n\r\nBut his mental endowments were of course of the higher importance,\r\nand it is difficult to imagine any more happily suited to the\r\nrequirements of vegetable anatomy during the period from 1830 to\r\n1850. At a time when men were building fanciful theories on inexact\r\nobservations, when Gaudichaud was once more explaining the growth in\r\nthickness of the woody portions of the plant after the manner of Wolff\r\nand Du Petit-Thouars, when Desfontaines’ account of the endogenous\r\nand exogenous growth of stems was still accepted, when Mirbel was\r\nendeavouring to support his old theory of the formation of cells by new\r\nobservations and beautiful figures, when Schulz Schulzenstein’s wildest\r\nnotions respecting laticiferous vessels were being rewarded with a\r\nprize by the Paris Academy, when Schleiden’s hastily adopted views\r\nrespecting cells and fertilisation appeared on the scene with great\r\nexternal success, von Mohl, for ever going back to exact observation,\r\nwas cutting away the ground from under ill-considered theories in\r\ncareful monographs, and at the same time bringing to light a mass of\r\nwell-established facts leading to further and serious investigation.\r\nThese theories have now only a certain historical interest, while von\r\nMohl’s contemporaneous works are still a rich repertory of useful\r\nobservations, and true models of clear exposition.\r\n\r\nHis written productions were preceded by a careful study of all\r\nbranches of botanical knowledge and the auxiliary sciences. That he not\r\nmerely acquired knowledge in this way, but trained the powers of his\r\nunderstanding also, is shown by the striking precision and clearness\r\nof his account of his first investigations. At a time when the\r\nnature-philosophy and Goethe’s doctrine of metamorphosis in a distorted\r\nform were still flourishing, von Mohl in spite of his youth approached\r\nthe subjects of his investigation with a calmness and a freedom from\r\nprepossessions, which are the more remarkable when we observe that his\r\nfriend Unger was at first quite carried away by the stream, and only\r\nslowly managed to reach the firm ground of genuine inductive enquiry.\r\n\r\nOwing to the extravagances and aberrations with which he made\r\nacquaintance as a young man in the nature-philosophy, von Mohl\r\ncontracted an aversion to all philosophy, evidently taking the\r\nformless outgrowths from the doctrines of Schelling and Hegel for\r\nsomething inseparable from it, as we may gather from his address at\r\nthe opening of the faculty of natural history in Tübingen, which had\r\nbeen separated at his instance from that of philosophy. His dislike\r\nto the abstractions of philosophy was evidently connected with his\r\ndistaste for far-reaching combinations and comprehensive theories,\r\neven where they are the result of careful conclusions from exact\r\nobservations. Von Mohl was usually satisfied with the establishment of\r\nseparate facts, and in his speculative conclusions he kept as closely\r\nas possible to what he had actually seen, for instance, in his theory\r\nof the thickening of cell-walls; and where new views opened before\r\nhim as a result of his exact observation, he cautiously restrained\r\nhimself and was generally content to hint at matters which bolder\r\nthinkers afterwards proceeded to investigate; such a case occurred in\r\nhis examination of cell-membranes by polarised light. Hence we miss\r\nto some extent the freer flight of imaginative genius in von Mohl’s\r\nscientific labours; but there is more than sufficient compensation for\r\nthis want in the sure and firm footing which he offers to the reader of\r\nhis works; if we pass from the study of the writings of phytotomists\r\nbefore 1844 to those of von Mohl, we are sensible of one predominant\r\nimpression, that of security; we have the feeling that the observer\r\nmust have seen correctly because the account which he gives of the\r\nmatter before us seems so thoroughly natural and almost necessarily\r\ntrue, and all the more because he himself notices all possible doubts,\r\nand lets those which he cannot remove remain as doubts. In these points\r\nvon Mohl’s style resembles that of Moldenhawer, but in von Mohl it\r\nattains to a mastery which is wanting in the other.\r\n\r\nThere is an evident connection between von Mohl’s dislike of\r\nfar-reaching abstractions and philosophic speculation on the results of\r\nobservation and the fact, that in the course of more than forty years’\r\nunintermitted application to phytotomy he never composed a connected\r\ngeneral account of his subject. His efforts as a writer were confined\r\nto monographs usually connected with questions of the day or suggested\r\nby the state of the literature. In these he collected all that had been\r\npublished on some point, examined it critically, and ended by getting\r\nat the heart of the question, which he then endeavoured to answer from\r\nhis own observations.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of these observations he looked about in every case\r\nfor the most suitable objects for examination, a point to which\r\nformer phytotomists, with the exception of Moldenhawer, had paid\r\nlittle attention; he then studied these objects thoroughly, and thus\r\nprepared the way for the examination of others, which presented greater\r\ndifficulties. Every monograph of this kind was a nucleus, round which\r\na larger number of observations might afterwards gather. In a long\r\nseries of such solid productions he treated conclusively all the more\r\nimportant questions of phytotomy.\r\n\r\nVon Mohl’s extraordinary carefulness was not however able to guard\r\nhim, calm observer though he was, from some serious mistakes, at least\r\nin his earlier years, such as those which occur in his first theory\r\nof intercellular substance (1836), and in his earliest views on the\r\nnature of the cell-membrane of the pollen-grain (1834). These and some\r\nother errors on the part of a gifted and truly inductive enquirer are\r\ninstructive, since they show that observation without any groundwork\r\nof theory is psychologically impossible; it is a delusion to suppose\r\nthat an observer can take the phenomena into himself as photographic\r\npaper takes the picture; the sense-perception encounters views\r\nalready formed by the observer, preconceived opinions with which the\r\nperception involuntarily associates itself. The only means of escaping\r\nerrors thus produced lies in having a distinct consciousness of these\r\nprepossessions, testing their logical applicability and distinctly\r\ndefining them. When von Mohl laid down his theory of intercellular\r\nsubstance, there evidently floated before his mind indistinct,\r\nhalf-conscious ideas of the kind that Wolff and Mirbel entertained\r\nof the structure of the vegetable cell; and as he considered the\r\ncell-membrane of the pollen-grain to consist of a cell-layer, he\r\nsummarised its obscure structural relations under the then very\r\nobscure conception of the cell. As a true investigator of nature, who\r\nadheres always and firmly to the results of further observation, and\r\nendeavours to clear his ideas by their aid, conceding only a relative\r\nvalue to every view, von Mohl soon escaped from these errors, and\r\nhimself supplied proofs of the incorrectness of his former opinion. The\r\nnumber of really erroneous statements in his works is wonderfully small\r\nconsidering the very large number of investigations in which he engaged.\r\n\r\nIn examining the part which von Mohl played in the general development\r\nof phytotomy we can distinguish satisfactorily two periods in his\r\nscientific career, the first of which extends from 1827 to about 1845.\r\nBefore 1845 he was acknowledged to be the first of phytotomists,\r\ndecidedly superior to all rivals; his authority, though often attacked\r\nby unimportant persons, grew from year to year. This period may be said\r\nto close with the publication of his ‘Vermischte Schriften’ in 1845.\r\nUp to that time investigations into the form of the solid framework of\r\ncell-membrane had chiefly attracted the interest of phytotomists, and\r\nin this subject there was no one who could measure himself with von\r\nMohl. Yet he began soon after 1830 to study the history of development\r\nin plants; in 1833 he described the development of spores in a great\r\nvariety of Cryptogams, in 1835 the multiplication of cells by division\r\nin an alga, and the cell-division in the formation of stomata in 1838;\r\nin this period appeared Mirbel’s first observations on the formation\r\nof pollen-cells (1833). Von Mohl too was the first, if we disregard\r\nTreviranus’ somewhat imperfect notices of the origin of vessels in 1806\r\nand 1811, who explained the history of the development of those organs;\r\nand his theory of the thickening of cell-membranes, the principles of\r\nwhich are to be found in his treatise on the pores in cellular tissue\r\n(1828), may also be regarded as a mode of conceiving the sculpture of\r\nthe cell-membrane from the point of view of the history of development.\r\n\r\nEver since 1838 Schleiden had raised the history of development to\r\nthe first rank in botanical investigation, but he had proposed a\r\nthoroughly faulty theory of cell-formation, to which von Mohl at\r\nfirst at least did not withhold his assent in spite of previous and\r\nmuch better observations; but after 1842 Nägeli devoted himself still\r\nmore thoroughly and with more lasting results to the study of the\r\ndevelopment both of vegetable cells and tissue-systems, and of the\r\nexternal organs. He introduced new elements into phytotomic research,\r\nand it soon became apparent that even the questions hitherto examined\r\nmust be grappled with in a different fashion. Von Mohl did not hold\r\naloof from the new direction, but completed a series of excellent\r\ninvestigations connected with the new questions in the theory of\r\ncell-formation. The most important of these was his enquiry into the\r\nnature of protoplasm, to which he gave the name still in use. In\r\nhis treatise, ‘Die Vegetabilische Zelle,’ which came out in 1851 in\r\nWagner’s Dictionary of Physiology, he even gave an excellent account\r\nof the modern theory of cell-formation; but notwithstanding all this,\r\nand the great authority which he rightly continued to enjoy, he was no\r\nlonger the guide who led the way in the domain of phytotomy, as he had\r\nbeen before 1845.\r\n\r\nHis zeal as an observer had at all times been chiefly attracted to the\r\nsolid framework of vegetable structure in its matured condition, though\r\na number of his most important works were devoted to the study of\r\ncell-contents.\r\n\r\nExcept in his ‘Anatomic der Palmen’ (1831), where he expended much\r\nand to some extent even unnecessary labour on figures representing\r\nthe general appearance of the tissue (histologic habit), von Mohl’s\r\nmicroscopic drawings do not aim at giving the collective impression,\r\nbut at facilitating the understanding of the delicate structure of\r\nsingle cells and their combinations by aid of the simplest possible\r\nlines. He always despised pictures from the microscope, such as were\r\nintroduced at a later time by Schacht,—a kind of artistic restoration\r\nof the originals and to some extent a playing with science; and in his\r\nlater publications he was more sparing of illustrations or omitted them\r\naltogether, in proportion as he acquired the power of giving clear\r\nverbal explanations of even difficult structural conditions.\r\n\r\nVon Mohl’s scientific activity was so wonderfully productive that it\r\nis not easy to present the reader with a clear account of it; but we\r\nmust endeavour at least to furnish such a summary of its chief results\r\nas may serve to give a general idea of his importance in the history\r\nof our science. We may here pass over such of his treatises as do not\r\nbear on the main questions of phytotomy, and notice only those that\r\nrelate to the structure of the solid framework of plants, because\r\nthe historical significance of his investigations into the history of\r\ndevelopment can only be understood in connection with the questions to\r\nbe treated in the following chapter. But we shall not limit ourselves\r\nto publications which appeared before 1845, though we may be thus\r\ncompelled to notice researches which in succession of time belong to\r\nthe next period, and indeed almost to the present moment.\r\n\r\n1. The view that the cell is the sole and fundamental element in\r\nvegetable structure had been already maintained by Sprengel and Mirbel,\r\nbut not supported by exact observations. Treviranus too had shown\r\nthat the vessels in wood are formed by the union of rows of cell-like\r\ntubes, but he had never arrived at a thoroughly clear conception of the\r\nmatter. On the one side was the theory that the plant consists entirely\r\nof cells, on the other, and for long the old and strange view, that\r\nthe spiral thread was an independent elementary organ of vegetable\r\nstructure,—a view which Meyen still maintained in 1830. Von Mohl must\r\nbe regarded as the first who took up the all-important position, that\r\nnot only the fibrous elements of bast and wood, which had long been\r\nconsidered to be elongated cells, but the vessels of the wood also\r\nare formed from cells; and we may on this point give great weight to\r\nhis own assertion that he was the first who observed the formation\r\nof vessels from rows of closed cells. This discovery happened in the\r\nyear 1831, and he describes distinctly, though briefly, the decisive\r\nobservations in his treatise on the structure of the palm-stem. At the\r\npoints of constriction in the vessels he saw the dividing walls, the\r\nexistence of which had been denied by all former phytotomists; ‘these\r\ndividing walls,’ he says, ‘are entirely different from the rest of\r\nthe membranes of the plant, being formed of a network of thick fibres\r\nwith openings between them.’ He studied the history of the development\r\nof these vessels both in palms and in dicotyledonous plants. ‘In the\r\nyoung shoot,’ he says, ‘are found at the spots, where afterwards\r\nthere are large vessels, perfectly closed large cylindrical tubes\r\nwith a transparent and very delicate membrane.’ He then shows how by\r\ndegrees the sculpture peculiar to the walls of vessels is formed on the\r\ninside of these tubes, and he takes the opportunity of saying that a\r\nmetamorphosis in time from one form of vessel into another is entirely\r\nout of the question, as Treviranus also and Bernhardi had maintained.\r\n‘The dividing walls (transverse septa),’ he continues, ‘are formed\r\nin a precisely similar manner to the side-walls of vessels; only the\r\noriginal tender membrane of the septa is usually lost in the meshes\r\nof the network of fibres.’ From that time no phytotomist capable of\r\nan independent judgment has had any doubt with regard to this view of\r\nthe formation of the vessels in wood. It is however striking enough\r\nthat von Mohl, who thought it so important to show that the cell is\r\nthe sole foundation of vegetable structure, never extended the proof\r\nto milk-vessels and other secretion-canals in order to show whether\r\nand how these also are formed from the cells. In his treatise on the\r\nvegetable cell (1851) he still expressed doubt about Unger’s assertion,\r\nthat the milk-vessels are also formed from rows of cells that coalesce\r\nwith one another, and held rather to the view of an anonymous writer\r\nin the ‘Botanische Zeitung’ of 1846, page 833, that these vessels are\r\nmembranous linings of gaps in the cell-tissue. He might well lose his\r\ntaste for the examination of these and similar organs after Schultz\r\nSchultzenstein had by his various treatises, written after 1824, on the\r\nso-called vital sap and the circulation which he attributed to it, made\r\nthis part of phytotomy a very quagmire of error, and had not refrained\r\nfrom replying in an unbecoming manner to von Mohl, who repeatedly\r\nopposed his views; moreover Schultz’s essay ‘Ueber die Circulation des\r\nLebenssafter’ (1833), which teems with absurdities, had received a\r\nprize from the Academy of Paris.\r\n\r\n2. The growth in thickness of the cell-membrane, and the sculpture\r\ncaused by it was a subject that is more or less connected with most\r\nof von Mohl’s writings. He developed the chief features of his\r\nview in 1828 in his first work, ‘Die Poren des Pflanzengewebes!’\r\nThe way in which he represented to himself the growth in thickness\r\nof cell-membranes at a later time may be expressed as follows. All\r\nelementary organs of a plant are originally very thin-walled perfectly\r\nclosed cells, which in the tissue are separated by walls formed of two\r\nlaminae[82]; on the inside of these primary cell-membranes, after they\r\nhave ceased to increase in circumference, new layers of membranous\r\nsubstance are formed, which lying one upon another adhere closely\r\ntogether, and represent the whole amount of secondary thickening\r\nlayers; on the inner side of the membrane thus thickened by apposition\r\nthere may usually[83] be perceived a tertiary layer of a different\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nBut there are certain sharply defined spots on the original cell-wall,\r\nwhere this thickening does not take place; in such spots the cell is\r\nstill bounded only by the primary membrane; it is these thin spots\r\nwhich bear the name of pits, and which Mirbel, and in some cases\r\nMoldenhawer, took for holes, but von Mohl considered that it was only\r\nin very exceptional cases that they were really changed into holes by\r\nresorption of the thin primary wall. In accordance with this theory,\r\nthe spiral, annular, and reticulated vessels are produced by deposition\r\nof thickening matter in the form suitable to each case on the inside\r\nof the originally smooth thin cell-wall. But like Schleiden and other\r\nphytotomists, von Mohl was not quite clear in his views either of the\r\norigin or mode of formation of matured bordered pits; it was supposed\r\nthat the two laminae of the dividing wall parted from one another\r\nat certain spots in such a manner that a lenticular hollow space\r\nwas formed between them, and that this space answered to the outer\r\nborder of the pit, while the inner border was the result of ordinary\r\npit-formation. This view, which could be shown to be incorrect by the\r\nhistory of development, arose in fact from inexact observation,—a rare\r\ncase with von Mohl; the true course of events in the formation of\r\nbordered pits was first described by Schacht in 1860.\r\n\r\nIt was mentioned above, that Meyen in his ‘Neues System der\r\nPhysiologie’ of 1837, i. p. 45, made cell-membranes consist of\r\nspirally wound fibres; von Mohl had described in 1836 the structural\r\nrelations of certain long fibrous cells of Vinca and Nerium, which\r\nmight be provisionally explained in this way; he was led by Meyen’s\r\nideas on the subject to a renewed and minute examination of the more\r\ndelicate structure of the cell-membrane in 1837; he first of all\r\ncleared the ground round the question, by distinguishing the cases in\r\nwhich real spiral thickenings lie on the inner side of the membrane,\r\nfrom those in which the membrane is smooth on the outside, but shows\r\nan inner structure of fine spiral lines; in these cases he assumed a\r\npeculiar arrangement of the molecules of cellulose, and endeavoured\r\nto illustrate the possibility of such a disposition by the phenomena\r\nof cleavage in crystals (‘Vermischte Schriften,’ p. 329); but he did\r\nnot succeed in explaining these very delicate conditions of structure,\r\nwhich we now call the striation of the cell-membrane, so clearly as\r\nNägeli afterwards did in connection with his molecular theory.\r\n\r\n3. The question of the substance and chemical nature of cell-membranes\r\nwas intimately connected with von Mohl’s theory of its growth in\r\nthickness; he was engaged in 1840 in minutely studying the reactions\r\nwhich various cell-membranes exhibit with iodine solution under\r\ndifferent conditions,—a question on which Schleiden and Meyen had\r\nrecently disagreed; von Mohl arrived at the result, that iodine imparts\r\nvery various colours to vegetable cell-membrane, according to the\r\nquantity in which it is absorbed; a small amount produces a yellow or\r\nbrown, a larger a violet, a still larger a blue tint; this depends\r\npartly on the extent to which the membrane is capable of distention;\r\nthe blue colour especially depends on the absorption of a sufficient\r\nquantity of iodine. Greater interest, excited at first by a very\r\nimportant work by PAYEN[84] in 1844, was taken in the question of\r\nthe chemical nature of the solid framework of the vegetable body, in\r\nwhich it was shown that the substance of all cell-membranes exhibits a\r\nsimilar chemical composition when freed from foreign elements. Payen\r\nconsiders that this material, cellulose, is present in a tolerably\r\npure form in the membranes of young cells, but is rendered less pure\r\nin older ones by ‘incrusting substances,’ whose presence changes the\r\nphysical and chemical characters of cell-membranes in various ways.\r\nThese incrusting substances may be more or less removed by treating\r\nthe membranes with acids, alkalies, alcohol, and ether, while other\r\ninorganic matters remain behind after combustion as an ash-skeleton.\r\nThis theory, which has been more perfectly worked out in modern times,\r\nwas soon afterwards met by Mulder with the assertion, that a large part\r\nof the layers composing the walls of cells consist from the first of\r\nother combinations and not of cellulose; he at the same time deduced\r\nfrom this view certain conclusions respecting the growth in thickness\r\nof cell-walls. He and Halting, relying on microscopic examination,\r\nmaintained that the innermost tertiary layer in thickened membranes\r\nis the oldest, and that the other layers are deposited on the outside\r\nof this, and are not composed of cellulose. Von Mohl opposed this\r\nview decidedly and successfully in the Botanische Zeitung of 1847; he\r\nlikewise in his work on the vegetable cell (p. 192), refuted the view\r\nof the varying substance of cell-membrane, which Schleiden had founded\r\non some obscure chemical grounds.\r\n\r\nIt would carry us much too far to enter into the details of this\r\nscientific dispute; Payen’s view of the chemical nature of the\r\nvegetable cell-wall, which von Mohl adopted and elaborated, has\r\nmaintained itself to the present day, and is generally considered to be\r\nthe true one; on the other hand, the foundations of von Mold’s theory\r\nof growth in thickness were shaken in 1858 by Nägeli’s observations,\r\nand we may say that on the whole it has been for ever superseded. It\r\nhas been nevertheless of great service in the development of our views\r\non cell-structure in plants; keeping closely to the facts directly\r\nobserved, it served to bring almost all the conditions of the sculpture\r\nof cell-walls under one point of view, and to refer their formation to\r\none general and very simple scheme; every such theory helps to advance\r\nscience, because it facilitates mutual understanding; in this case,\r\nwhen Nägeli proposed his more profound theory of intussusception,\r\nthe understanding of it was essentially assisted by a previous exact\r\nknowledge of von Mohl’s theory in its principles and results. In\r\nconclusion it may be mentioned here that von Mohl afterwards in his\r\ninvestigation into the occurrence of silica in cell-membranes made a\r\nlarge and important addition to the knowledge of their more delicate\r\nstructure, and of the way in which incrusting substances are deposited\r\nin them (Botanische Zeitung, 1861).\r\n\r\n4. The views of phytotomists on the so-called intercellular substance\r\nduring the twenty years from 1836 to 1856 were closely connected with\r\nthe older theories of cell-formation, but were opposed to the modern\r\ndoctrine of the cell founded by Nägeli in 1846. Von Mohl himself had\r\nintroduced this idea for the first time into the science in 1836 in\r\none of his earlier and inferior essays, ‘Erläuterung meiner Ansicht\r\nvon der Structur der Pflanzensubstanz,’ rather in opposition to than\r\nin connection with his own theory of the growth and structure of\r\ncell-walls. Setting out from modes of formation of cell-membranes\r\nin some Algae, difficult to understand and in some respects quite\r\npeculiar, von Mohl believed that he saw in many cases in the higher\r\nplants also between the sharply-defined membranes, which bound the\r\ncell-spaces and which he regarded as the entire cell-membranes, a\r\nsubstance in which the cells are imbedded, for such is its appearance\r\nwhen it is largely developed; when it lies in small quantity only\r\nbetween cells in close apposition, it looks like a thin layer of\r\ncement. After Meyen in his ‘Neues System,’ pp. 162, 174 had declared\r\nagainst this view in 1837, von Mohl too abandoned it more and more,\r\nand afterwards limited the occurrence of intercellular substance to\r\ncertain cases, being convinced that much that he had before taken for\r\nit consisted only of layers of secondary thickening, between which\r\nhe still saw the primary lamina of the cell-membrane. The theory of\r\nintercellular substance was taken up and further developed by other\r\nphytotomists, by Unger especially in the Botanische Zeitung for 1847,\r\np. 289, and afterwards chiefly by Schacht; Wigand came forward as an\r\nopponent of it in 1854 in his ‘Botanische Untersuchungen,’ p. 65, and\r\nlogically following out von Mohl’s theory of the cell-membrane declared\r\nthe thin layers of intercellular substance as well as the cuticle,\r\nwhich had been first correctly distinguished by von Mohl, to be laminae\r\nof primary cell-membrane, the substance of which had undergone profound\r\nchemical change. These ideas also of the intercellular substance and\r\nthe cuticle assumed an entirely different aspect when Nägeli introduced\r\nhis theory of intussusception.\r\n\r\nThe limits imposed on this history render it necessary to be content\r\nwith these indications of von Mohl’s share in the working out of the\r\ntheory of cells in its connection with the structure of the solid\r\nframework of cell-membrane; we shall return again to his observations\r\non the formation of individual cells.\r\n\r\n5. Forms of tissue and comparative anatomy. Phytotomy up to 1830\r\nhad been weak in its classification of tissues, in its ideas as to\r\ntheir arrangement, and consequently in its histological terminology;\r\nthe inconvenience arising from this state of things was most\r\ndistinctly felt when it became necessary to compare the structure of\r\ndifferent classes of plants, Cryptogams, Conifers, Monocotyledons\r\nand Dicotyledons, and to establish their true differences and actual\r\nagreements. How little phytotomy had advanced in this respect is\r\nshown plainly in the account of tissues given by Meyen in his ‘Neues\r\nSystem’ in 1837. To von Mohl belongs the merit of having perceived at\r\nan early period in his scientific career, and more clearly than his\r\ncontemporaries, the value of a natural and sufficient discrimination\r\nof the various forms of tissue, and the necessity of obtaining a\r\ncorrect view of their relative disposition; he thus showed the way to\r\nan understanding of the general structure of the higher plants, and\r\nrendered it possible to make a scientific comparison of the structure\r\nof different classes of plants.\r\n\r\nVon Mohl, like Moldenhawer long before, showed from the first a correct\r\napprehension of the peculiar character of the vascular bundles as\r\ncompared with other masses of tissue. He, too, examined them first in\r\nMonocotyledons, and gave an account of them in his treatise on the\r\nstructure of Palms (1831), and also in his later essays on the stems\r\nof Tree-ferns, Cycads, and Conifers and on the peculiar form of stem\r\nin Isoëtes and Tamus elephantipes, to be found in his ‘Vermischte\r\nSchriften’ of 1845. His just conception of them as special systems\r\ncomposed of various forms of tissue has made his account clear and\r\nintelligible, and his whole treatment of the subject appears new in\r\ncomparison with that of every previous writer except Moldenhawer. If\r\nthese labours of von Mohl are surpassed in value by later studies of\r\nthe history of development, they served for the time as a nucleus\r\nfor further investigations, especially into the nature of stems. It\r\ncontributed in a high degree to a correct insight into the structure\r\nof the stem, that von Mohl, agreeing in this with Moldenhawer,\r\ndistinguished the portion belonging to the wood from the portion\r\nbelonging to the bast in the vascular bundles, and regarded both as\r\nessential constituents of a true vascular bundle. Not less important\r\nwere his enquiries into the longitudinal course of the vascular bundle\r\nin the stem and leaf, which showed that in the Phanerogams the bundles\r\nin the stem are only the lower extremities of the bundles, the upper\r\nextremities of which bend outwards into the leaves, and that the\r\nMonocotyledons and Dicotyledons agree in this particular, though the\r\ncourse of the bundle differs considerably in the two cases. He obtained\r\nan important result in this respect in his researches on palm-stems\r\nin 1831, when he proved the incorrectness of the distinction between\r\nendogenous and exogenous growth in thickness, which had been laid\r\ndown by Desfontaines, and even employed by De Candolle in framing his\r\nsystem. According to Desfontaines, the wood of Monocotyledons appears\r\nas a collection of scattered bundles, of which those that run out\r\nabove into the leaves come from the centre of the stem. From this very\r\nimperfect observation he deduced the view, that the bundles of vessels\r\nin Monocotyledons originate in the centre of the stem, and that they\r\ncontinue to be formed there, until the older hardened bundles in the\r\ncircumference form so solid a sheath that they withstand the pressure\r\nof the younger; then all further growth in thickness must cease, and\r\nhence the columnar form of the monocotyledonous stem. This doctrine\r\nfound general acceptance, and was employed by De Candolle to divide\r\nvascular plants into Endogens and Exogens, in accordance with the very\r\ngeneral inclination felt in the first half of the present century to\r\ndistinguish the great groups of the vegetable kingdom by anatomical\r\ncharacters. It is true that Du Petit-Thouars had already shown that\r\nsome monocotyledonous stems have unlimited growth in thickness; neither\r\nhis nor Mirbel’s later observations succeeded in shaking the theory,\r\nthe adherents of which met such cases by assuming a peripherical as\r\nwell as a central growth. Then von Mohl in the treatise above-mentioned\r\ndemonstrated the true course of the vascular bundles in the stem\r\nof Monocotyledons, and at once did away with the whole theory of\r\nendogenous growth in the opinion of all who were capable of judging,\r\nthough some even eminent systematists for a long time maintained the\r\nold error. The results which von Mohl obtained from his study of the\r\ncomparative anatomy of the stem, rested mainly on careful observation\r\nof the mature tissue-masses, and when he studied the history of\r\ndevelopment, he was not in the habit of going back to the very earliest\r\nand most instructive stages. Hence he failed to explain fully the real\r\npoints of agreement and difference of structure between Tree-ferns\r\nand other Vascular Cryptogams and Phanerogams, and in like manner he\r\nstopped halfway when engaged in explaining the secondary growth in\r\nthickness of dicotyledonous stems from the nature of their vascular\r\nbundles, and the formation of cambium. The account of growth in\r\nthickness which he still gave in 1845 (‘Vermischte Schriften,’ p. 153),\r\nand which rests less on observation than on an ideal scheme, is highly\r\nobscure, and even in the treatise which he published in the Botanische\r\nZeitung in 1858 on the cambium-layer of the stem of Phanerogams, and\r\nin which he criticises the newer doctrines of Schleiden and Schacht,\r\nthe subject is far from being fully cleared up, though the views there\r\nadvocated are decidedly superior to his former ones. A satisfactory\r\nconclusion with respect to growth in thickness of the woody body and of\r\nthe rind was not reached till the history of development in vegetable\r\nhistology began to be more thoroughly studied.\r\n\r\nAs von Mohl had from the first laid special stress on the peculiar\r\ncharacter of the vascular bundles as compared with other tissue-masses,\r\nso he perceived that the structure of the epidermis and of the\r\ndifferent forms of exterior tissue was thoroughly characteristic, and\r\nhe succeeded in arriving at a clearer understanding of the matter\r\nin this case than in the other. Very confused ideas had prevailed\r\non the subject before he took it up, and we owe to him the best and\r\nmost important knowledge which we at present possess. Especially\r\nimportant were his researches into the origination and true form of\r\nstomata (1838 and 1856), and into the cuticle and its relation to the\r\nepidermis (1842 and 1845). He brought entirely new facts to light\r\nby his study of the development of cork and the outer bark in 1836;\r\nthese tissues had scarcely been examined with care till then, and\r\ntheir formation and relation to the epidermis and the cortical tissue\r\nwere quite unknown. In the latter treatise, one of his best, the\r\ndifference between the suberous periderm and the true epidermis was\r\nfirst shown, the various forms of the periderm were described, and the\r\nremarkable fact established that the scaling of the bark was due to\r\nthe formation of fine laminae of cork, which, penetrating gradually\r\ninto the substance of the cortex, withdraw more and more of it from\r\nits connection with the rest of the living tissue, and as they die off\r\nform by their accumulation a rugged crust, which is the outer bark\r\nsurrounding most thick-stemmed trees. The investigation was so thorough\r\nand comprehensive, that later observers, Sanio especially in 1860,\r\ncould only add to it some more delicate features in the history of the\r\nprocess. In the same year appeared his enquiry into the lenticels,\r\nwhere von Mohl however overlooked what Unger discovered at the same\r\ntime (‘Flora,’ 1836), namely, that these forms arise beneath the\r\nstomata; but he at once corrected Unger’s hazardous supposition that\r\nthe lenticels are similar forms to the heaps of gemmae on the leaves of\r\nthe Jungermannieae. Unger, for his part, was not long in adopting von\r\nMohl’s explanation of the lenticels as local cork-formations.\r\n\r\nSince von Mohl thus distinctly brought out the special character of\r\nthe vascular bundles and of the different forms of epidermal tissues,\r\nit must excite surprise that he, like former phytotomists, did not\r\nfind himself under the necessity of framing some conception of the\r\nrest of the tissue-masses in their peculiar grouping as a whole, as a\r\nspecial system, and of classifying and suitably naming the different\r\nforms that compose them, though his examination of Tree-ferns would\r\nseem to have offered him an occasion for doing so. Von Mohl, like his\r\ncontemporaries, was satisfied with calling everything that is neither\r\nepidermis, cork or vascular bundle, parenchyma, without distinctly\r\ndefining the expression.\r\n\r\nHere we leave von Mohl and his labours for the present, to return once\r\nmore in the following chapter to the share which he took in the further\r\nprogress of phytotomy. We shall perhaps best realise his importance\r\nin the history of the science, if we try to think of all that we have\r\nnow seen him doing for it as still undone. There would then be a huge\r\ngap in modern phytotomic literature, which must have been filled up by\r\nothers before there could be any further addition to the knowledge of\r\ncells and tissues founded on the history of their development; for it\r\ncan hardly be conceived that the advance to which we owe the present\r\ncondition of vegetable anatomy, could have been based upon ideas such\r\nas those of Meyen, Link, and Treviranus, without von Mohl’s preliminary\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE CELL, FORMATION OF TISSUES, MOLECULAR\r\n                     STRUCTURE OF ORGANISED FORMS.\r\n\r\n                              1840-1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the period between 1830 and 1840 it had come to be understood, that\r\nthe old theories of cell-formation of Wolff, Sprengel, Mirbel, and\r\nothers, resting on indistinct perceptions and not on direct and exact\r\nobservation, could only give an approximate idea of the formation\r\nof cells. But in the course of that time really different cases of\r\nformation of new cells were accurately observed by Mirbel, and more\r\nespecially by von Mohl, who described different modes of formation\r\nof spores, and in 1835 the first case of vegetative cell-division.\r\nUnfortunately these observations, excellent in themselves, applied\r\nto cases of cell-formation which do not occur in the ordinary\r\nmultiplication of cells in growing organs, and von Mohl guarded himself\r\nfrom founding a general theory of cell-formation on his observations\r\non cells of reproduction and on a growing filamentous Alga. Mirbel\r\nalso cautiously regarded the formation of pollen-cells and that which\r\nhe supposed to be the process in the germination of spores as cases of\r\na peculiar kind, adhering to his old theory of the origin of ordinary\r\ntissue-cells.\r\n\r\nSchleiden’s behaviour was different. Having somewhat hastily observed\r\nthe free cell-formation in the embryo-sac of Phanerogams in 1838, he\r\nproceeded at once to frame a theory upon it which was to apply to all\r\ncases of cell-formation, and especially to that in growing organs.\r\nThe very positive way in which he announced this theory and set\r\naside every objection that was made to it, combined with his great\r\nreputation at the time, at once procured for it the consideration\r\nof botanists generally; and the most important representatives of\r\nphytotomy, von Mohl himself at first not excepted, allowed that there\r\nwas a certain amount of justification for it. It was a question in\r\nwhich theoretical considerations were not of primary importance; direct\r\nand varied observation of careful preparations with strong magnifying\r\npowers could alone form the basis for further investigation. Unger\r\nshowed in this way that the processes at the growing point of the stem\r\ncould scarcely be reconciled with Schleiden’s theory, and in this\r\nview he was supported by the English botanist Henfrey; but Nägeli\r\nwas the first who addressed himself with energy and sound reasoning\r\nto the important and difficult question, how cells are formed in\r\nreproductive and growing vegetative organs, and how far the processes\r\nare the same in the lower Cryptogams and in the Phanerogams. He set\r\nout by assuming that Schleiden’s theory was in the main correct, but\r\nhis long-continued investigations led him finally to the conviction\r\nthat it must be entirely abandoned, and he proposed the outlines\r\nof the theory of cell-formation which is accepted at the present\r\ntime. In this case, as before in questions of morphology, he applied\r\nhimself first, and with great success, to the investigation of the\r\nlower Cryptogams, while Alexander Braun’s observations on some very\r\nsimple Algae contributed materially to the further development of the\r\ncell-theory, and especially to extending and correcting the idea of\r\nthe cell; Hofmeister’s researches also in embryology not only produced\r\ngreat results for morphology, but at the same time supplied a variety\r\nof facts which served to complete Nägeli’s view. The further this was\r\nworked out, the more apparent it became that the external circumstances\r\nin the processes of cell-formation might be very various, and that von\r\nMohl’s earlier observations especially gave a correct representation\r\nof individual and typical cases; but more important than this result\r\nwas the fact declared by Nägeli in 1846, that in all these different\r\nkinds of cell-formation it was only the external and secondary matters\r\nthat varied, while the essential part of the process was in all cases\r\nthe same, and it was soon perceived that cell-formation in the animal\r\nkingdom, which was now being more thoroughly examined, agreed in the\r\nmain with that of the vegetable kingdom, as Schwann and Kölliker had\r\nintimated in 1839 and 1845.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to give any account here of the totally different\r\ntheories which Theodor Hartig and Karsten proposed about the same time.\r\nThey do not rest on careful observation, and we may omit them not\r\nmerely because they are rejected by the unanimous judgment of better\r\nobservers, but because they had no influence upon the development of\r\nthe doctrine of cell-formation, and are therefore without historical\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIt lies in the nature of the case, that investigations into the origin\r\nand multiplication of cells should turn the attention of observers\r\nmore and more to their living contents, for these are actively and\r\nimmediately concerned with the formation of new cells. The various\r\ngranular, crystalline, and mucilaginous portions of the contents of\r\ncells had been repeatedly observed before 1840, and Schleiden and\r\nMeyen had specially studied the ‘movements of cell-sap’; but it was\r\nin the course of observations on the history of development between\r\n1840 and 1850 that attention was first called to a substance which\r\nplays a regular part in the formation of new cells, which envelopes\r\nthe cell-nucleus discovered by Robert Brown, which undergoes the most\r\nimportant changes as the cell grows, which forms the entire substance\r\nof swarmspores, and the disappearance of which leaves behind it a\r\ndead framework of cell-membrane. This substance, which is much more\r\nimmediately concerned with sustaining the processes of life than is\r\nthe cell-wall, was seen by Schleiden in 1838 and taken for gum. It was\r\nmore carefully studied by Nägeli between 1842 and 1846, and perceived\r\nby him to be nitrogenous matter. Von Mohl described it in 1844 and\r\n1846 from new points of view, gave it the name of protoplasm which it\r\nstill bears, and showed that it is this substance, and not the proper\r\ncell-sap, which carries out the movement of rotation and circulation in\r\ncells discovered by Corti in the previous century, and again observed\r\nby Treviranus in 1811. The Algae proved highly instructive in the\r\nstudy of this remarkable substance also. The swarmspores of Algae and\r\nFungi observed by Alexander Braun, Thuret, Nägeli, Pringsheim, and De\r\nBary showed that protoplasm is not dependent on the cell-membrane for\r\nits vitality, that by virtue of its own internal powers it can alter\r\nits form, and even move in space. In 1855 Unger in his ‘Lehrbuch’\r\npointed out the resemblance of this substance to the matter known as\r\nsarcode in the lower forms of animals, a resemblance brought out more\r\nplainly in 1859, when De Bary’s studies of the Myxomycetes proved that\r\nthe substance of these forms was protoplasm, which continues to live\r\nfor a considerable time, and often in large masses, before it forms\r\ncell-membranes. Zootomists now began to take an interest in these\r\nresults of botanical research; Max Schulze (1863), Brücke, and Kühne\r\nstudied animal and vegetable protoplasm, and the conviction gained\r\nground more and more in the years from 1860 to 1870 that protoplasm is\r\nthe immediate principle of vegetable and animal life. This discovery is\r\none of the most important results of research in modern natural science.\r\n\r\nNot less important were the results obtained from the study of\r\nthe rest of the organised contents of cells; von Mohl proved that\r\nchlorophyll-corpuscles, the most considerable organs of nutrition\r\nin the plant, are formed of protoplasm, and Theodor Hartig, though\r\nhis cell-theory was a mistake, did good service by his discovery of\r\naleurone-grains in seeds and of the crystalloids which sometimes occur\r\nin the grains, and which are also formed of protoplasm and renewed\r\nfrom protoplasm. Radikofer, Nägeli, and others added to our knowledge\r\nof the form and chemical composition of these aleurone-grains. To\r\nstarch-grains, which had been frequently examined, by Payen especially,\r\nNägeli devoted an investigation at once comprehensive and profound,\r\nand obtained results of extraordinary value; these were given to the\r\nworld in an exhaustive work published in 1858 under the title ‘Die\r\nStärkekörner,’ and form an epoch not in phytotomy only, but in the\r\ngeneral knowledge of organised bodies. By the application of methods of\r\nresearch unknown before in microscopy, Nägeli arrived at clear ideas\r\nof the molecular structure of the grains, and of their growth by the\r\nintroduction of new molecules between the old ones. This theory of\r\nintussusception founded on the observation of starch-grains derives\r\nits great importance from the fact that it served directly to explain\r\nthe growth of cell-membrane, could be applied generally to molecular\r\nprocesses in the formation and alteration of organic structures, and\r\naccounted for a long series of remarkable phenomena, especially the\r\nbehaviour of organised bodies in polarised light. Nägeli’s molecular\r\ntheory is the first successful attempt to apply mechanico-physical\r\nconsiderations to the explanation of the phenomena of organic life.\r\n\r\nWhile men of the highest powers of mind were devoting themselves to\r\nthe solution of these difficult problems, the study of tissues was\r\nnot neglected in the years after 1840, and here too it was Nägeli who\r\ngave the chief impulse and the direction to further development. In\r\nthe periodical which he published in conjunction with Schleiden he had\r\nalready (1844-46) given an account of some searching enquiries which he\r\nhad made into the first processes in the formation of vascular bundles\r\nfrom uniform fundamental tissue; in the Cryptogams he observed the\r\nproduction of the tissue of the whole plant from the apical cell of the\r\ngrowing stem, and this discovery, still further pursued by Hofmeister\r\nespecially, has given rise during the last twenty years to a copious\r\nliterature, which has been of service to the theory of the formation of\r\ntissues, to morphology, and consequently also to systematic botany.\r\nThe researches of Hofmeister, Nägeli, Hanstein, Sanio, and others into\r\nthe first formation of vascular bundles from the fundamental tissue of\r\nyoung organs led to important results for morphology, in so far as it\r\nwas now for the first time possible to judge of the morphological value\r\nof anatomical and histological relations. The growth in thickness of\r\nwoody plants, a question of primary importance to vegetable physiology,\r\nwas first made intelligible by the discovery of the mode of formation\r\nof vascular bundles and their true relation to cambium; Hanstein and\r\nNägeli, and afterwards Sanio especially, cleared up the questions\r\nconnected with growth in thickness in their main features before and\r\nafter 1860.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we pass on to show how the great results above-mentioned were\r\nattained, we encounter some difficulties. After 1840 botanical\r\nliterature multiplied to an extent before unknown; it is from elaborate\r\nmonographs on single subjects in phytotomy, from some text-books, and\r\nespecially from smaller essays in botanical periodicals that we must\r\ngather an account of the further development of scientific thought.\r\nMuch as the founding of scientific periodicals has facilitated\r\ncommunication between professed botanists, yet this form of literature\r\nmakes it more difficult to see the way clearly through the work of\r\nearlier periods and to discover the historical connection in the\r\nscience, not to speak of the harm that usually results from it to young\r\nand inexperienced students.\r\n\r\nSuch being the nature of the sources from which we must draw our\r\ninformation, we shall obtain a better general view of the whole subject\r\nif we depart from the practice of former chapters, and follow out the\r\nmore important questions in their historical development instead of\r\nconnecting them directly with leading persons. Such a treatment of the\r\nsubject is indeed suggested by the fact that we are now no longer on\r\npure historic ground; for the majority of the men who have developed\r\nmodern doctrines since 1840 are still alive, and it must be uncertain\r\nwhether the account here attempted may not be impugned on some ground\r\nor other. Owing to the extraordinary diversity of opinion that exists\r\namong botanists even on the most general questions in the science, it\r\nis extremely difficult to ascertain what can be considered as a common\r\npossession,—an unfortunate condition of things, from which no science\r\nperhaps suffers so much as botany.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which individual botanists have contributed to the\r\nadvance of phytotomy during the period under consideration will\r\nappear of itself from the following narrative; and if we speak almost\r\nexclusively of Germans, it is for the simple reason that Englishmen\r\nfrom Grew’s time till now can scarcely be said to have added anything\r\nto our knowledge of phytotomy; the Italians also, once so gloriously\r\nrepresented by Malpighi, scarcely come under consideration in the\r\nquestions now to be dealt with, while French botanists, represented by\r\nMirbel in the preceding period, though they have produced many works on\r\nphytotomy since his time, have had no important share in deciding the\r\nfundamental questions of modern science.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding period it was necessary to take into consideration\r\nthe increasing improvement of the microscope, in order to understand\r\nthe development of opinion on vegetable structure; but it is scarcely\r\nneedful to do so after 1840. Since that time good and serviceable\r\ninstruments with strong magnifying powers and clear definition have\r\nbeen within the reach of every phytotomist; and though improvements\r\nare still being constantly made, yet the microscopes that were in the\r\nhands of skilful observers between 1840 and 1860 were fully adequate\r\nto deciding the new questions proposed to them. The chief improvement\r\neffected in the microscope during this period was the fitting it with\r\napparatus for the polarisation of light, and for the more convenient\r\nmeasurement of objects; we shall see presently what influence the\r\nformer improvement had on the perfecting of Nägeli’s molecular\r\ntheory. As microscopes improved and the questions to be solved grew\r\nmore difficult, it became necessary to bestow increased care on the\r\npreparation of objects; it was no longer sufficient to cut or dissect\r\nneatly, and so learn the form of the solid portions of vegetable\r\nstructure; measures of precaution and auxiliary measures of the most\r\nvarious kinds were needed to obtain a clear view of the soft contents\r\nof cells, and to observe the protoplasm as far as possible in a living\r\nstate and protected from prejudicial influences; all sorts of chemical\r\nreagents were applied to make the objects more transparent, or to show\r\ntheir physical and chemical characters. The method invented by Franz\r\nSchulze before 1851 deserves to be specially mentioned; it consisted\r\nin isolating the cells in a few minutes’ time by boiling them in a\r\nmixture of nitric acid and potassium-chlorate, and thus shortening\r\nMoldenhawer’s process of maceration or superseding it altogether. In a\r\nword, the technicalities of the microscope were perfected in a variety\r\nof ways by Schleiden, von Mohl, Nägeli, Unger, Schacht, Hofmeister,\r\nPringsheim, De Bary, Sanio, and others, and raised to an art which must\r\nbe learnt and practised like any other art. Young microscopists were\r\nable after 1850 to learn this art in the laboratories of their elders,\r\nand to profit by their technical experience and scientific counsels;\r\nschools of phytotomy were formed at least in the German universities;\r\nelsewhere, it is true, the old condition of things remained in which\r\neveryone had to trust to himself from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe general dissemination of good microscopes was accompanied by a\r\nhigher standard of requirement in the execution of drawings from\r\nthe instrument, especially after von Mohl had shown the way; and\r\nthe invention of lithography and the revival of wood-engraving\r\nministered to the needs of science, supplying the place of the old\r\ncostly copper-plate printing. Hence we find an increasing number of\r\nbeautiful drawings in scientific monographs; the text-books also\r\ncould now be supplied with an abundance of figures, and this greatly\r\npromoted the general understanding of things which could otherwise\r\nbe seen only under the glass of each observer. From the close of the\r\n16th century wood-cuts had fallen more and more into disuse, and had\r\nbeen replaced by copper-plates; after 1840 wood-engraving was restored\r\nto its old rights and was found to be a more convenient method of\r\npictorial illustration, especially for text-books; thus Schleiden’s\r\n‘Grundzüge’ of 1842, von Mohl’s ‘Vegetabilische Zelle’ of 1851,\r\nUnger’s and Schacht’s text-books were enriched with many and sometimes\r\nvery beautiful wood-cuts. Lithographs were generally preferred for\r\nperiodicals and monographs; the ‘Botanische Zeitung,’ founded by Mohl\r\nand Schlechtendal in 1843, and till after 1860 the chief organ for\r\nshorter phytotomic communications, was illustrated by a large number\r\nof beautiful prints from the establishment of the Berlin lithographer,\r\nSchmidt.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DEVELOPMENT OF THE THEORY OF CELL-FORMATION FROM 1838 TO 1851.\r\n\r\nSince we are here dealing with questions of fundamental importance\r\nnot only to one branch of botanical study but to the whole science\r\nof botany, and even to the rest of the natural sciences, it seems\r\nimperative that we should follow step by step the founding and\r\nperfecting of the theory of the cell, as far as is possible in the\r\nlimited space at our command; we shall deal with the sexual theory\r\nfurther on in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nAs usually happens in the inductive sciences, the period of strict\r\ninductive investigation into cell-formation was preceded by a still\r\nlonger time, during which botanists ventured to put forward general\r\ntheories in reliance on highly imperfect observations. We have already\r\nseen how Caspar Friedrich Wolff in 1759 made cells originate as\r\nvacuoles in a homogeneous jelly, and how this view was adopted in\r\nall essential points by Mirbel at a late period in the 18th century;\r\nhow Kurt Sprengel, and with him a number of phytotomists, among them\r\nTreviranus as late as 1830, supposed cells to be formed from granules\r\nand vesicles in the cell-contents, an idea which Link it is true\r\nopposed in 1807, but afterwards accepted to a great extent. Though\r\nMoldenhawer as early as 1812 (‘Beiträge,’ p. 70) distinctly rejected\r\nthese theories, and published observations which if followed up would\r\nhave led to the right path, yet the botanists above-named and others\r\nwith them, long continued to adhere to the earlier views. Kieser,\r\nfor example (‘Mémoire sur l’organisation des plantes,’ 1812) further\r\ndeveloped Treviranus’ theory, that the fine granules in the latex of\r\nplants are cell-germs which are afterwards hatched in the intercellular\r\nspaces. Schultz-Schultzenstein in his work ‘Die Natur der lebenden\r\nPflanze,’ 1823-28, i, p. 607 rejected this view and adopted that\r\nof Wolff and Mirbel. Scarcely better than the notion of cell-germs\r\nrepresented by Sprengel, Treviranus, and Kieser was the theory\r\npropounded by Karsten soon after 1840; that of the French botanists\r\nRaspail and Turpin[85] (1820-1830), though conveyed in a different\r\nterminology, corresponded in its main points with the views of Sprengel.\r\n\r\nIt had been the good fortune of Mirbel at the beginning of the century,\r\nand again thirty years later, to promote the advance of phytotomy by\r\nmeans of important observations, though he may have interpreted some of\r\nthem incorrectly; the same thing happened again thirty years later, and\r\nit was a German enquirer, von Mohl, who corrected his observations and\r\nviews on both occasions.\r\n\r\nIn his famous treatise on Marchantia polymorpha, which appeared in 1835\r\nin the Memoirs of the French Institute, the first part having been\r\nlaid before the Paris Academy in 1831-32, Mirbel distinguished three\r\nmodes of cell-formation; in the germination of the spores of Marchantia\r\nnew cells are formed from the germ-tube and new cells again from these\r\nby a similar process, much in the same way therefore as that which\r\nactually occurs in the germination of Yeast-fungi; he found a second\r\nkind of cell-formation in the production of the gemmae of Marchantia,\r\nwhere he distinctly observed the successive appearance of the dividing\r\nwalls, but formed an erroneous idea of the proceeding on the whole; in\r\nthe further development of the gemmae and in other cases of growth he\r\nconsidered that new cells are formed between those that are already\r\npresent in the manner supposed in his earlier theory.\r\n\r\nVon Mohl’s dissertation on the multiplication of vegetable cells\r\nby division, published in 1835 and reprinted in ‘Flora’ of 1837,\r\nshows how strange these processes even then appeared; in this work\r\nhe expresses some doubts about Mirbel’s statements, but he accepts\r\nthem on the whole, and only makes incidental mention of his own more\r\nnumerous and better observations on the development of spores (‘Flora,’\r\n1833), though he had there seen several cases of cell-division and\r\nfree cell-formation with tolerable distinctness. Adolph Brongniart\r\n(‘Annales des sciences naturelles,’ 1827) also had observed, though\r\nimperfectly, the formation of pollen-grains in their mother-cells in\r\nCobaea scandens, and Mirbel, in the appendix to the work mentioned\r\nabove, had given a correct description and good figures of the\r\nformation of pollen-cells; and yet von Mohl neglected to compare\r\nthese important observations of cases of cell-division with his own;\r\neven in 1845, when he published the latter in a revised form in his\r\n‘Vermischte Schriften,’ he overlooked the close relation between the\r\nformation of those pollen-grains and spores, and the cell-division in\r\nCladophora. Still this treatise of von Mohl’s is of great importance\r\nin the history of the theory of cell-formation, because it described a\r\ncase of cell-division for the first time step by step and brought all\r\nthe salient points into relief. Dumortier had observed the division\r\nof cells as early as 1832[86], and Morren had seen it in Closterium in\r\n1836, but had not given the needful details. Finally, von Mohl applied\r\nthe experience which he had gained from Cladophora to other filamentous\r\nAlgae, and pointed out the similarity between these processes and\r\nthe division of Diatoms, which he consequently claimed as plants in\r\nopposition to Ehrenberg, who considered them to be animals (‘Flora,’\r\n1836, p. 492).\r\n\r\nMeyen next, relying on von Mohl’s observations on Cladophora, declared\r\nin the second volume of his ‘Neues System’ that cell-division was a\r\nvery common occurrence in Algae, Filamentous Fungi and the Characeae,\r\nbut he neglected any closer investigation of the processes by which\r\nthe division is introduced and completed. His comparison of these\r\ncases of cell-formation with the formation of spores, pollen-grains,\r\nand endosperm-cells is moreover noticeable as the first attempt\r\nto distinguish what is now known as free cell-formation from\r\ncell-division; it was obviously the want of this distinction which long\r\nprevented clearer views on the whole of this field of observation.\r\nThe due separation of these two modes of cell-formation was a short\r\nstep after the observations that had been already made; and if that\r\nstep had been taken, Schleiden’s theory would have been impossible,\r\nand the development of the cell-theory would not have been prejudiced\r\nby the mistake, introduced by Schleiden after 1838, of applying the\r\nmode of free cell-formation, which he believed he had observed in the\r\nembryo-sac of Phanerogams, to the multiplication of vegetative cells in\r\ngrowing organs, and regarding it as the only mode of cell-formation.\r\nThis would have been the more impossible, since von Mohl in the same\r\nyear gave an excellent description of the development of stomata by\r\ndivision of a young epidermis-cell and the later separation of the\r\ndividing wall into two laminae. But von Mohl in the years immediately\r\nfollowing was over-cautious in refraining from all speculative\r\nconsideration of cases that lay clearly before him, and his views\r\nwere still undecided in 1845, when Unger and Nägeli had already made\r\ngood observations on the formation of tissue-cells in growing organs\r\n(‘Vermischte Schriften,’ 1845, p. 336).\r\n\r\nSchleiden’s theory of cell-formation arose out of a curious mixing\r\ntogether of obscure observations and preconceived opinions, and reminds\r\nus indeed strongly of the old notions of Sprengel and Treviranus; it is\r\ntrue that he distinctly rejected their views, but he too made new cells\r\narise from very minute granules, and his theory like theirs did not\r\nrest on any thorough course of observation.\r\n\r\nRobert Brown, (see his Miscellaneous Writings, edited by T. T. Bennett,\r\nI.) had discovered the nucleus in the cells of the epidermis of\r\nOrchidaceous plants in 1831, and had shown that it was very generally\r\npresent in the tissue-cells of Phanerogams, but had obtained no results\r\nfrom his discovery. The cell-nucleus lay undisturbed, till Schleiden\r\nsuddenly made it the soul of his theory and the starting-point of all\r\ncell-formation. He considered that the nucleus was formed from the\r\nmucilaginous content of the cell, which he assumed on insufficient\r\ngrounds to be of the nature of gum; this he called the cytoblastem, and\r\nthe nucleus itself the cytoblast. As he states that his cytoblastem\r\nbecomes yellow and granular in solutions of iodine, we may recognise in\r\nit our own protoplasm.\r\n\r\nWe make acquaintance with Schleiden’s theory of cell-formation in its\r\noriginal form, if we turn to his treatise, ‘Beiträge zur Phytogenesis,’\r\n(in the Archiv für Anatomie, Physiologie, etc. von Johannes Müller,\r\n1838). The work begins with some remarks on the general and fundamental\r\nlaws of human reason, etc., discusses the literature of cell-formation\r\nin a few lines without mentioning von Mohl’s numerous observations,\r\ngoes on to mention the general occurrence of the nucleus which here\r\nreceives its new name, then occupies itself with gum, sugar, and\r\nstarch, and at last comes to the main subject. There are two spots,\r\nsays Schleiden, in the plant, where the formation of new organisation\r\nmay be most easily and most certainly observed, the embryo-sac and\r\nthe end of the pollen-tube, in the latter of which, according to his\r\ntheory of fertilisation, the first cells of the embryo are supposed to\r\nbe formed, but where in fact no cells are formed. At both spots small\r\ngranules soon arise in the gum-mucilage, which, before homogeneous,\r\nnow becomes turbid, and then single larger and more sharply defined\r\ngranules, the nucleoli, appear. Soon after, the cytoblasts are seen as\r\ngranular coagulations from the granular mass; they grow considerably in\r\nthis free condition, but as soon as they have reached their full size,\r\na delicate transparent vesicle is formed upon them; this is the young\r\ncell, which at first presents the appearance of a very flat segment of\r\na sphere, whose plane side is formed by the cytoblast, the convex by\r\nthe young cell (the cell-membrane), which rests upon the cytoblast as\r\na watch-glass on a watch. Gradually the vesicle becomes larger and of\r\nfirmer consistence, and now the whole of the wall, except where the\r\ncytoblast forms part of it, consists of a jelly. By-and-bye the cell\r\ngrows beyond the edge of the cytoblast and rapidly becomes so large\r\nthat the latter appears only as a small body inclosed in one of the\r\nside walls. The shape of the cell becomes more regular with advancing\r\ngrowth and under the pressure of adjoining cells, and often passes\r\ninto that of a rhombododecahedron, which Kieser for reasons drawn from\r\nthe nature-philosophy assumed to be the fundamental form. It is only\r\nafter the resorption of the cytoblast that the formation of secondary\r\ndeposits on the inner surface of the cell-wall commences, though some\r\nexceptional cases are adduced. Schleiden thinks (p. 148) that he may\r\nassume that the process here described is the general law of formation\r\nof vegetative cell-tissue in Phanerogams. He adds particularly that the\r\ncytoblast can never lie free inside the cell, but is always enclosed in\r\na duplication of the cell-wall, and he thinks that it is an absolute\r\nlaw that every cell, except perhaps in cambium, begins as a minute\r\nvesicle, and grows to the size which it reaches in its matured state.\r\nThe resemblance of this view to that of Sprengel and Treviranus is\r\nincreased by what we find further on, where we read that from the\r\ncell-germs in the spores of Marchantia usually only from two to four\r\nserve to form cells, the rest becoming overlaid with chlorophyll,\r\nand being consequently withdrawn from the vital process. He who is\r\nacquainted with the modern view of the processes of free cell-formation\r\nfounded on the numerous and careful investigations of later times will\r\nscarcely discover in the above account of Schleiden’s theory a single\r\ncorrect observation.\r\n\r\nSoon after, von Mohl published in ‘Linnaea,’ 1839, p. 272, his\r\nobservations on the division of the mother-cells of the spores of\r\nAnthoceros; these were carefully made and were correct in all the main\r\npoints; and in opposition to Mirbel’s former statements they establish\r\nthe fact, that the division is effected by the mucilaginous contents\r\nof the cell, and consequently that it is not a passive division of\r\nthe contents of the mother-cell produced by the growth inwards of\r\nprojections of the cell-wall.\r\n\r\nUnger[87] was the first to declare distinctly against Schleiden’s\r\ndoctrine, and his observations on the punctum vegetationis appeared\r\nin the ‘Linnaea’ of 1841, p. 389; from the size and position of the\r\ncells he concluded that the tissue-cells in this case are formed by\r\ndivision, and not in the manner alleged by Schleiden. Soon after Nägeli\r\nalso (‘Linnaea,’ 1842, p. 252) observed the processes of cell-formation\r\nin the extremities of roots, but he did not conceive them to be cases\r\nof division; he saw two nuclei form in each mother-cell, and a new\r\ncell form round each nucleus, and explained the origin of the dividing\r\nwall as due to the meeting together of the two new cells; he thought\r\nthat a similar process takes place in stomata and in the mother-cells\r\nof pollen; this conception was not absolutely incompatible with\r\nSchleiden’s theory, but there was this difference, that in Nägeli’s\r\ncase essential processes were correctly observed, but were to some\r\nextent incorrectly interpreted. In the same year appeared the first\r\nedition of Schleiden’s ‘Grundzüge der wissenschaftlichen Botanik,’\r\nin which his theory of cell-formation was repeated in a more precise\r\nform. That he was thoroughly in earnest to maintain it is shown by the\r\nfact that he gave still another exposition of it in his ‘Beiträge zur\r\nBotanik’ in 1844, where he insists that his method of cell-formation\r\nis the general one, though it has been distinctly ascertained in the\r\nPhanerogams only. But how completely an observer may be led captive\r\nby a preconceived opinion may be learnt from Schleiden’s suggestion,\r\nthat the formation of zygospores in Spirogyra is in accordance with his\r\nviews, though it is impossible to conceive of a case of cell-formation\r\nmore easy to observe, or less reconcilable with Schleiden’s theory.\r\nIt was mentioned in the first book, that Hedwig and Vaucher were\r\nacquainted with the remarkable process of the formation of zygospores\r\nin the alga-genus Spirogyra; but this as late as Schleiden’s time\r\nwas not regarded as an example of cell-formation, and his view was\r\nreally a step in advance, since it brought a process, so highly\r\npeculiar according to existing ideas, under the general conception of\r\ncell-formation.\r\n\r\nThe systematic elaboration of the theory of cells, founded on careful\r\nobservation and mature reflection, began with the year 1844. Almost\r\nat the same time in this year appeared Nägeli’s detailed enquiries\r\ninto the occurrence of the cell-nucleus and into cell-division, von\r\nMohl’s observations on the primordial utricle and its behaviour in\r\nthe process of cell-division in young tissue, and lastly those of\r\nUnger on merismatic cell-formation (cell-division) as a general\r\nmode of proceeding in the growth of organs. As these observers were\r\nchiefly concerned to test the correctness and general applicability\r\nof Schleiden’s theory, they necessarily paid special attention to\r\nthe general occurrence of the cell-nucleus and to its position on\r\nthe side of the cell-wall, for these were the points most accessible\r\nto observation and criticism. The discussion of these observations\r\ndisclosed a defect in the current phraseology, in which the word\r\ncell was commonly understood to mean only the cell-membrane, but\r\nsometimes included everything belonging to and contained in the cell;\r\nhitherto moreover the protoplasm of the cell had not been sufficiently\r\ndistinguished from the rest of the cell-contents.\r\n\r\nNägeli and von Mohl arrived simultaneously at a clearer understanding\r\nof these points; von Mohl recognised the primordial utricle (1844) as a\r\ncomponent part of the cell-contents and not belonging to the cell-wall,\r\nand explained the part which it plays in cell-division; in 1846 he\r\narrived at a clear conception of the protoplasm as a peculiar substance\r\ndistinct from the other contents of the cell and gave it the name it\r\nstill bears. Meanwhile Nägeli had also distinguished the protoplasm\r\nfrom everything else in the cell, and noticed its pre-eminent\r\nimportance in cell-formation and its nitrogenous character.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to mention here, that investigations into the\r\nprocesses of cell-formation compelled observers to search for the\r\nspots where cell-formation actually takes place, and thus the fact was\r\nascertained, that cells in statu nascendi are not to be found in all\r\nparts, not even in all growing parts of the plant, but that we must\r\nlook for them in the so-called puncta vegetationis in the stem and\r\nroot, in the youngest lateral organs, and between the bark and the wood\r\nin woody plants. About this time a new idea began to be attached to\r\nthe word cambium, which Mirbel had used in the sense of a nourishing\r\njuice saturating the plant; it was now applied to the tissue-masses in\r\nwhich the formation of new cells takes place, and specially to the very\r\nthin layer of tissue lying between the wood and the rind, from which\r\nnew layers of wood and rind in woody plants are formed—a layer, which\r\naccording to Mirbel’s theory had been a mass of sappy matter, in which\r\nnew cells arise as vacuoles.\r\n\r\nUnger in an enquiry into the growth of internodes (‘Botanische\r\nZeitung,’ 1844) again declared himself as an opponent of Schleiden’s\r\ntheory. He maintained first of all and erroneously that the\r\ncell-nucleus is not of general occurrence in tissue where division is\r\ntaking place, but he argued rightly from the position of the cells,\r\nfrom the difference of thickness in their walls, and from their\r\nrelative size, in favour of their multiplication by the formation of\r\ndividing walls; he noticed the part played by the cell-contents in\r\nthe multiplication of cells in hairs, and asserted that merismatic\r\ncell-formation (cell-division) is the general rule in the growth\r\nof organs of vegetation, while he distinctly declared that it was\r\nnot possible to bring all that is actually seen at the spots where\r\nformation of cellular tissue is taking place into agreement with\r\nSchleiden’s theory. But Unger did not observe the processes that take\r\nplace in cell-division step by step; his observations sufficed to make\r\nSchleiden’s theory very improbable without offering enough foundation\r\nfor a new one, and Schleiden did not fail to reply to Unger’s\r\nobjections in the second edition of his ‘Grundzüge’ in 1845.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the same year, von Mohl published in the ‘Botanische\r\nZeitung’ the treatise on the primordial utricle which has been already\r\nmentioned; by the term primordial utricle he meant partly the very thin\r\nlayer of protoplasm, which in large cells full of sap lines the inside\r\nof the cell-wall, and partly an outer layer of the protoplasm in young\r\ncells, which are still rich in that substance. It is true that the\r\ndistinguishing the primordial utricle was not a very important matter;\r\nbut von Mohl applied it with his usual thoroughness to obtaining a\r\nbetter insight into cell-formation by calling attention (p. 289) to\r\nthe circumstance, that the cells of the cambium-layer between the rind\r\nand the wood fit into one another and leave no intercellular spaces;\r\nfrom this he concluded that there are only two possible modifications\r\nof cell-multiplication, either division of cells by formation of a\r\ndividing wall or formation of cells within cells; in each of these\r\nyoung cells is a primordial utricle, the origin of which must at\r\nleast be contemporary with that of the cell (cell-membrane). ‘Could\r\nit then be distinctly shown, that two primordial utricles exist side\r\nby side in cells, which are in the act of multiplying, before a\r\npartition-wall is formed between them, it would be evident that in the\r\ncambium layer and at the points of the stem and root the formation of\r\nthe primordial utricle precedes that of the cell.’ Von Mohl believed\r\nthat he had seen this process, but was not perfectly satisfied as to\r\nthe correctness of his observation; but he continues: ‘Since every\r\nyoung cell contains a primordial utricle, this must either be absorbed\r\nbefore a multiplication of the cell commences in order to make way\r\nfor two new ones formed in its stead, or the old primordial utricle\r\nmust separate into two.’ He considered the first supposition to be the\r\nprobable one, rejecting Unger’s statement that the nuclei are formed\r\nafter the division. It is surprising that after these considerations\r\nvon Mohl thought that his own observations necessarily confirmed\r\nSchleiden’s theory of cell-formation, although he noticed beside that\r\nthe nucleus never forms a part of the cell-wall, an essential feature\r\nin that theory; but in fact von Mohl took the membrane which according\r\nto Schleiden separates from the nucleus for the primordial utricle.\r\nBut these mistakes are soon followed by the right conjecture, that\r\nthe substance of the primordial utricle may be identical with the\r\nmucilaginous mass, which commonly encloses the nucleus, and so with\r\nthat which von Mohl two years later named protoplasm. In this later\r\ntreatise (‘Botanische Zeitung,’ 1846), in which he proves that the\r\nwell-known movements in the interior of cells are made not by the\r\nwatery cell-sap but by the protoplasm, he states (p. 75) that it is\r\nthe protoplasm which produces the nucleus, that the organisation of\r\nthe nucleus ushers in the formation of the new cell, and that contrary\r\nto Schleiden’s theory the protoplasm completely envelopes the nucleus,\r\nwhich always occupies the centre of very young cells, as is the case\r\nespecially in the endosperm-cells observed by Schleiden. He then shows\r\nhow the protoplasm of young cells at first solid afterwards forms\r\nsap-cavities and stretches between them in walls, bands or threads, the\r\nsubstance of which exhibits the streaming movement. Von Mohl strangely\r\nneglected on this occasion to compare carefully his former observations\r\non the origin of spores and the division of Alga-cells with his new\r\nresults, and to seek for the essential resemblances between them; on\r\nthe contrary he said emphatically that the cell-division in Cladophora\r\nis probably a quite different process from the multiplication of\r\ntissue-cells in higher plants.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Unger and von Mohl up to the year 1846 were quite\r\nsufficient to refute Schleiden’s theory, but not to give a clear\r\nand general view of the processes in the formation of cells; the\r\ndifferent kinds of cell-formation were neither carefully distinguished\r\nfrom one another, nor could they be referred to a common principle.\r\nBoth observers had endeavoured to conjecture the course of events\r\nfrom certain data, supplying by inference what they had not directly\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nNägeli about the same time took up a different position as an opponent\r\nof Schleiden’s theory. In an exhaustive treatise on the cell-nucleus,\r\ncell-formation, and cell-growth in plants, the first part of which\r\nappeared in 1844 in the periodical founded by himself and Schleiden,\r\nhe collected together all that had hitherto been observed by himself\r\nand others from various points of view. All sections of the vegetable\r\nkingdom were once more systematically examined with reference to\r\nthe occurrence of the cell-nucleus and the different kinds of\r\ncell-formation; all cases of the latter were carefully compared\r\ntogether in their resemblances and differences, in order to deduce\r\nfrom the observed phenomena that which was essential and universal.\r\nThe first result was, that Schleiden found himself obliged, in the\r\nsecond edition of his ‘Grundzüge’ in 1845, to accept the cell-division\r\nestablished by Nägeli in Algae and the mother-cells of pollen as a\r\nsecond kind of cell-formation; thus began the movement in retreat\r\nwhich was destined to end in the following year with the overthrow of\r\nSchleiden’s theory. This was effected by the continuation of Nägeli’s\r\ntreatise in the third volume of the periodical for 1846. In the first\r\npart of his work Nägeli had set out by assuming the correctness of\r\nSchleiden’s assertions, though he was even then compelled to modify\r\nthem considerably. In the second part, however, in consequence of\r\nfurther observations Schleiden’s theory was declared in plain terms\r\nto be utterly incorrect, and was refuted point by point. But Nägeli\r\nwas not obliged to confine himself to this negative result; his\r\ncomprehensive investigations supplied material at the same time for\r\nconstructing a new theory of cell-formation, which not only took in all\r\nthe various cases, but declared the principle which lay at the root\r\nof all. If we compare this second part of Nägeli’s treatise with von\r\nMohl’s publications from 1833 to 1846, we shall see that von Mohl had\r\nobserved with accuracy a number of important facts, but that Nägeli\r\nadded largely to them, and, which is the main point, elaborated them\r\ninto a comprehensive theory embracing all kinds of cell-formation.\r\nHow important the correct distinction of the protoplasm from the rest\r\nof the cell-contents was for the perfecting of the theory of cells is\r\nseen from Nägeli’s declaration, that he retracts his former view which\r\nrested on the authority of Schleiden, because it sprang from a time\r\nwhen he was ignorant of the significance of the mucilage-layer (the\r\nprotoplasm), though it is true that he indicates at the same time other\r\npoints and new considerations which definitively set aside Schleiden’s\r\ntheory. After investigating the different modes of free cell-formation\r\nand finding the processes there quite different from Schleiden’s\r\naccount of them, he proceeded to search for free cell-formation where\r\nSchleiden had affirmed that it invariably occurs, namely in growing\r\nvegetative organs in the higher plants. But this investigation led\r\nhim to the conclusion that all vegetative cell-formation is true\r\ncell-division, and that even the reproductive cell-formation in some\r\nAlgae and Fungi is effected by division; the reproductive cells of\r\nmost plants are the result of free cell-formation, but it should be\r\nobserved that the term free cell-formation is here used not exactly in\r\nthe modern sense, inasmuch as Nägeli included in it the formation of\r\nfour-fold grains (tetrads) in spores and pollen. If the distinction\r\nbetween cell-division and free cell-formation had often been suggested\r\nby former observers, Nägeli was the first who distinctly defined\r\nit, though not exactly as it is now defined. ‘In cell-division the\r\ncontents of the mother-cell separate into two or more portions; a\r\nperfect membrane forms round each of these portions, which at the\r\nmoment of its appearance rests partly on the wall of the mother-cell\r\nand partly on the adjacent walls of the sister-cells. In free\r\ncell-formation a smaller or larger part of the contents of a cell, or\r\neven the whole of them becomes isolated. On its surface is formed a\r\nperfect membrane, which is everywhere free on its outer face. There are\r\ntwo processes in the formation of a cell; the first is the isolation\r\nor individualising of a part of the contents of the mother-cell,\r\nthe second the formation of a membrane round the individualised\r\nportion.’ He then proceeds to show that the cell-wall is formed by\r\nthe separation of non-nitrogenous molecules from the nitrogenous\r\nmucilage (protoplasm). These sentences contain all that is general\r\nand essential in vegetative cell-formation. Further on he notices the\r\npeculiarities in the various processes in cell-formation; he says that\r\nthe individualising of the cell-contents assumes four forms; first,\r\nsingle small portions of the contents separate themselves inside the\r\nrest, as occurs in the formation of free germ-cells in Algae, Fungi,\r\nand Lichens, and of endosperm-cells in Phanerogams; secondly, the whole\r\ncontents of one cell, or of two by conjugation of associated cells,\r\ncollect into a free spherical or ellipsoidal mass, as in the formation\r\nof germ-cells in the Conjugatae; thirdly, the whole contents of a cell\r\nseparate into two or more portions, which is now called cell-division;\r\nfrom this Nägeli distinguishes as his fourth form, the process known as\r\nabscision (Abschnürung), which occurs in the formation of germ-cells in\r\nmany Algae and Fungi.\r\n\r\nSchleiden had declared it to be a general law in plants, that cells are\r\nonly formed inside mother-cells. Meyen however, Endlicher, and Unger,\r\nhad recently assumed the formation of new cells between the older\r\nones; Nägeli maintained that all normal cell-formation, vegetative and\r\nreproductive, takes place only within mother-cells.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the long-cherished notion that there must be one\r\ngeneral and fundamental form of cell, Nägeli pointed to the fact that\r\ncells have very different forms at the moment of their production.\r\nThose which arise by free cell-formation are, he says, at first always\r\nspherical or ellipsoidal; those produced by cell-division have a shape\r\nnecessarily conditioned by the form of the mother-cell and the manner\r\nof division. He showed further that changes in the shape of cells with\r\nadvancing growth depend materially on whether they enlarge equally\r\nin all parts of their circumference or not. These considerations,\r\nobvious as they are, were now for the first time pointed out and fully\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nThe reader who is already familiar with our subject will recognise\r\nin the passages adduced from Nägeli without further explanation the\r\nessential principles of the modern theory of cells, especially if he\r\ncompares them with the views propounded at the same time and previously\r\nby Schleiden, Unger, and von Mohl. But, as might be expected, the\r\nfurther investigations, which were pursued with zeal during the\r\nsucceeding twenty years and produced a considerable literature, did\r\nmuch to enlarge and perfect Nägeli’s theory in many of its details\r\nand to correct it in some minor points; the theory itself facilitated\r\nthis process by supplying a scheme to which the investigation of\r\nspecial questions could readily be referred. Whether the nucleus is\r\na solid body or a vesicle, whether in the division of a mother-cell\r\ninto compartments the wall of partition always grows from without\r\ninwards or is formed simultaneously over its whole surface, whether it\r\nis originally composed of two laminae or of one which is afterwards\r\ndifferentiated,—these and many other questions were decided in course\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nSchleiden’s theory was now definitively set aside, a deeper insight was\r\nobtained into the nature of the cell, and the ideas connected with the\r\nword became broader and more profound. The knowledge of the formation\r\nof cells showed that the cell-walls, which had been hitherto regarded\r\nas the important part, are only secondary products, that the true\r\nliving body of the cell is represented by its contents and especially\r\nby the protoplasm. Alexander Braun, relying on numerous researches\r\ninto the lower Algae, expressed himself in 1850 (‘Verjüngung,’ p.\r\n244) to the effect that it is an inconvenience that the word cell is\r\nused at one time to designate the cell with its wall, at another time\r\nthe cell without its wall, or again the wall without the cell. Since\r\nthe contents are the essential part of the cell and form a separate\r\nand individual whole which has its own membrane-like boundary, the\r\nprimordial utricle, before the secretion of the membrane of cellulose,\r\nwe must either confine the term cell to the enveloping membrane or\r\nto the chamber which it forms and find another name for the body\r\nof the contents, or else call this the true and proper cell. This,\r\nwhich presents itself at once as the correct mode of conception to\r\nanyone who observes the formation of swarmspores in Algae and Fungi\r\nand many other cases of cell-formation, was from this time forward\r\na vital point in the doctrine of the cell. Braun contributed also\r\nto the clearing up of the ideas of botanists on this subject by\r\nbringing together under one systematic view and classifying all the\r\nvarieties of cell-formation which were known to him up to the year\r\n1850, and especially by a more searching investigation into modes of\r\nconjugation. Henfrey’s contributions (‘Flora’ of 1846 and 1847) rested\r\nentirely on the observations of German botanists, and brought to light\r\nnothing that was independently and essentially new. On the other hand\r\nHofmeister’s new observations on the development of pollen (1848), and\r\nhis many remarks on cell-formation in his epoch-making researches into\r\nembryology in 1851, contributed repeatedly to the deciding of doubtful\r\npoints, especially in the behaviour of the nucleus in cell-formation\r\nand the production of the dividing walls. Von Mohl, who in spite\r\nof his own excellent observations maintained up to 1846 a somewhat\r\nundecided attitude of mind in respect to Schleiden’s theory, which was\r\nat that time still in vogue, published in 1851, in his treatise ‘Die\r\nvegetabilische Zelle,’ an excellent summary of the results which had\r\nbeen so far achieved. In describing cell-division he notices specially\r\nthat the new nuclei occupy the centres of the future daughter-cells\r\nbefore the division of the contents commences; but he still clung to\r\nhis old view, that in every instance of cell-division the parting-wall\r\nmust form progressively from without inwards, as in Cladophora,\r\ncontrary to Nägeli’s and Hofmeister’s correct statements, that cases\r\nalso occur of simultaneous formation at every point of the surface of\r\nthe partition-wall. As usual, however, von Mohl rested his opposition\r\non a good observation, and showed that in the case of the formation of\r\npollen in dicotyledonous plants it is possible to burst the membrane\r\nof a mother-cell in the act of dividing, and set free the protoplasm\r\nwhen it is already deeply divided into the four parts, and so to see\r\nthe half-formed partition-walls; but this only proved that such was the\r\nprocess in the cases observed, the formation of the partition-walls\r\nbeing simultaneous in others. It may be mentioned in this place, that\r\nthe idea of special mother-cells in the formation of pollen introduced\r\nby Nägeli in 1842 was in entire accordance with the condition of the\r\nscience at the time, since he meant by the term the laminae of membrane\r\nformed during the successive divisions of the mother-cell. To call\r\nthese still special mother-cells, as some modern phytotomists do,\r\nis quite unjustifiable, because since 1846, when Nägeli propounded\r\nhis theory, the word cell, as we have seen, no longer designated the\r\nmere membrane but the whole body of the cell, while the expression\r\nspecial mother-cell rests on the older phraseology, in which cell and\r\ncell-membrane are identical.\r\n\r\nThe additions made to the doctrine of cell-formation during the greater\r\npart of the twenty years after 1851 were unimportant in comparison with\r\nthe mighty development which it had experienced during the preceding\r\nten years. These years had indeed been marked by the greatest possible\r\nactivity and fruitfulness in results in all parts of botanical study.\r\nBy the labours of Unger, von Mohl, Nägeli, Braun, and Hofmeister,\r\nnot only were the foundations laid for a true theory of cells, but\r\nthe details were worked out, and the conceptions connected with them\r\nfinally cleared up. Textbooks could now disseminate the new teaching\r\nthrough wider circles, and with these works may be classed von Mohl’s\r\ntreatise already mentioned on the vegetable cell, since it came much\r\ninto use in a later and special edition, and was made by many teachers\r\nof botany the foundation and guide in their lectures. It was now become\r\nthe fashion to compose not general text-books of botany, but compendia\r\nof anatomy and physiology, and thus morphology and systematic botany\r\nwere neglected, as anatomy and physiology had been in the period\r\nimmediately preceding Schleiden’s time. Whoever therefore wished to\r\nconsult a complete manual of general botany was for some time obliged\r\nto be content with Schleiden’s ‘Grundzüge’; and this had a great\r\ndeal to do with keeping alive his erroneous doctrines on cells and\r\nfertilisation among general readers, while the professed botanists\r\nhad long given in their adherence to more modern and more correct\r\nviews. It is a misfortune in our science to be singularly poor in good\r\ntext-books, which might have given a general account from time to time\r\nof the existing condition of research; this is one of the reasons why\r\nfor some time past even official representatives of botanical science\r\noften differ so much from one another in their fundamental views on\r\nmethod, and on the question of how much has been actually established\r\nand how much still remains doubtful in the main divisions of the\r\nsubject, that a mutual understanding seems often impossible. That a\r\nbetter state of things in this respect prevails in zoology, physics,\r\nand chemistry, is certainly not a little due to the many good compendia\r\nand text-books, which endeavour to give some account of the progress of\r\nthose sciences from year to year.\r\n\r\nHowever, during the period from 1850 to 1870 Schacht and Unger\r\nattempted to make the results of modern phytotomic investigation\r\naccessible to general readers by means of text-books. Such was the\r\nnature of Schacht’s[88] work, ‘Die Pflanzenzelle,’ published in\r\n1852, a book which claimed to expound all parts of phytotomy by the\r\naid of the author’s own observations, with occasional reference only\r\nto the writings of others; the attempt was so far impossible, as the\r\nessential points had already been fully cleared up by the labours of\r\nother botanists. The work had however the advantage of attracting the\r\nattention of the reader by numerous good original drawings, and the\r\nstyle was enlivened by the constant appeal to original observation;\r\nat the same time, through insufficient use of the available\r\nliterature, the author’s views not unfrequently fell short of the\r\nexisting standard of knowledge. Worse than this however was a certain\r\ndefect of education, which led the writer into self-contradiction\r\nand to incorrect classification of his facts; things fundamentally\r\nimportant were sometimes neglected for unimportant details, and a\r\ncertain unreflecting empiricism was apparent in the whole work, in\r\nmarked contrast with the logical exactness of von Mohl, Nägeli, and\r\nHofmeister. In the second edition of the work, published in 1856 under\r\nthe title, ‘Lehrbuch der Anatomie und Physiologie der Gewächse,’ we\r\nfind many improvements in the details, but still on the whole the same\r\nformal defects. It is not unimportant in a historical point of view to\r\nnotice this character of Schacht’s writings, because during this period\r\nmost young botanists and other persons also derived their knowledge\r\nof phytotomy and of the nature of cells chiefly from him; his books\r\ndid not truly represent the condition of the science; their defective\r\nreasoning had an injurious effect on the minds of younger readers,\r\nand they introduced into phytotomy and vegetable physiology a habit\r\nof accumulating a mass of undigested facts, such as has for some time\r\nmarked the condition of morphology and systematic botany.\r\n\r\nUnger’s text-book ‘Anatomie und Physiologie der Pflanzen’ (1855) was\r\nsuperior in conception and execution. It introduced the beginner to\r\nthe doctrine of cells with careful attention to all that was known\r\non the subject, if sometimes with some hastiness of decision, while\r\nit brought the really important points everywhere into prominence\r\nand employed individual facts to explain the general propositions,\r\nas should always be done in a work intended for learners. But in\r\naddition to this Unger’s book contained much that was really new and\r\nvaluable, and among other things some very important remarks on the\r\nphysiological characteristics of protoplasm; and it pointed out for\r\nthe first time the similarity between vegetable protoplasm and the\r\nsarcode in Rhizopods, which Max Schulze had before carefully described.\r\nIn this year Nägeli also published investigations into the primordial\r\nutricle and the formation of swarmspores in his ‘Pflanzenphysiologische\r\nUntersuchungen,’ Heft I, which gave a new insight into the physical\r\nand physiological characteristics of protoplasm. It has been\r\nmentioned above that De Bary’s investigations into the Myxomycetes\r\nin 1859 had thrown new light on the subject of protoplasm, and had\r\ncalled attention to vital phenomena connected with it, which, though\r\nanalogous to what had been before observed, were rendered very striking\r\nfrom the circumstance that in this case the protoplasm was not in\r\nmicroscopically small portions enclosed by firm cell-walls, but moved\r\nabout and showed changes of shape in large, sometimes in very large,\r\nmasses, that were entirely free and unconfined. Here was the best\r\nopportunity for making a nearer acquaintance with protoplasm and for\r\nlearning to recognise it as the immediate support of all vegetable\r\nand animal life; in succeeding years the zootomists and physiologists\r\nMax Schulze, Brücke, Kühne, and others established the fact that the\r\nsubstance which lies at the foundation of cell-formation in animals\r\nagrees in its most important characteristics with the protoplasm of\r\nvegetable cells. A more detailed account of modern researches on this\r\nsubject, which would moreover involve the examination of Hofmeister’s\r\nwork of 1867, ‘Die Lehre von der Pflanzenzelle,’ does not fall within\r\nthe limits of our history.\r\n\r\n 2. FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF OPINION ON THE NATURE OF THE SOLID FRAMEWORK\r\n OF CELL-MEMBRANE IN PLANTS AFTER 1845.\r\n\r\nBetween 1840 and 1850 the most eminent representatives of phytotomy\r\nwere chiefly engaged, as we have seen, in observing the formation of\r\nvegetable cells, and in framing the true theory of the subject by\r\nprocess of induction. It was not to be expected that, while these\r\nlabours were bringing year by year new things to light and keeping\r\nopinion on the formation of cells in a constant state of fluctuation,\r\ntheir results would lead to very important changes in the theory of\r\nthe solid framework of cell-membrane founded by von Mohl. On the\r\ncontrary, it was at this time that his views such as we have seen them\r\non the connection of cells one with another, on the configuration of\r\ntheir partition-walls and on their growth in thickness, attained their\r\ngreatest influence. His theory seemed to stand firm and complete when\r\ncontrasted with the unsettled state of opinion respecting the origin\r\nof cells, and the question, how far it could be made to agree with the\r\nnew observations on the history of cell-formation, was hardly raised.\r\nIn the midst of the strife of opinion on the latter subject appeared\r\nvon Mohl’s ‘Vermischte Schriften’ in 1845, in which his views on the\r\nstructure of mature vegetable tissue were produced in a series of\r\nmonographs as the apparently irrefragable result of his observations.\r\nAnd in fact phytotomic research up to 1860 followed the train of\r\nthought initiated by von Mohl, till at last the inadequacy of his views\r\nwas rendered apparent between 1858 and 1863 by Nägeli’s new theory of\r\ngrowth by intussusception, and by the profounder insight obtained into\r\nthe nature of cell-formation.\r\n\r\nA sufficient proof of the correctness of these remarks is to be\r\nfound in the further development of the views of botanists on the\r\nintercellular substance and the cuticle, which might have adapted\r\nthemselves before 1850 to the new theory of cells, but instead of\r\ndoing so were moulded by the ideas current before 1845. It has been\r\nshown in the preceding chapter how von Mohl gradually restricted the\r\ntheory of intercellular substance which he had proposed in 1836, and\r\nhad come in 1850 to regard this substance as only a cement which might\r\nin many cases be perceived between the cell-walls. It should be added\r\nhere, that Schleiden in connection with his theory of cells considered\r\nboth the intercellular substance and the cuticle to be supplementary\r\nsecretions from the cells, and made the former fill the intercellular\r\nspaces, just as laticiferous and resiniferous passages are filled\r\nwith secretions from the adjacent cells (1845). Unger too in 1855\r\n(‘Anatomie und Physiologie der Pflanzen’) thought the existence of a\r\ncement between the cells necessary to prevent their falling asunder.\r\nSchacht, who in his ‘Pflanzenzelle’ of 1852 had followed Schleiden in\r\nexplaining the intercellular substance and the cuticle as secretions or\r\nexcreta from the cells of the plant, still kept on the whole to this\r\nview in 1858, though he modified it in some important points. This\r\ntheory of Schleiden and Schacht was first opposed by Wigand in a series\r\nof essays (1850-1861), in which in strict adherence to von Mohl’s\r\ntheory of apposition he sought to prove, that the layers which are\r\nvisible in wood-cells as intermediate laminae in the partition-walls,\r\nand which till then had been regarded as a cement between contiguous\r\ncells, an intercellular substance, were nothing else than the thin\r\nprimary membranous laminae formed in the process of cell-division,\r\nand subjected to subsequent chemical change, while the secondary\r\nlayers of thickening in von Mohl’s sense lie on both sides of them.\r\nThe cuticle on the epidermis was explained in a corresponding manner.\r\nThough Sanio in 1863 raised a variety of objections to Wigand’s view,\r\nhe still adhered to it in principle, and found a strong confirmation\r\nof it in the fact, that he succeeded in producing the well-known\r\ncellulose-reaction in the intercellular substance of wood-cells when\r\nfreed from foreign admixtures.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Wigand and Sanio were sufficient to overthrow von\r\nMohl’s account of the intercellular substance and the cuticle, but\r\nthey had not proved that the intermediate laminae are in fact the\r\nprimary partition-walls on which von Mold’s secondary thickening-layers\r\nhad been deposited, on both sides in the case of the intercellular\r\nsubstance, on one side in that of the cuticle. The structure of the\r\npartition-walls and the existence of the cuticle could be explained\r\nin a totally different way from the point of view now opened by\r\nNägeli’s theory of intussusception; there was no need now to see\r\neither a secretion or a primary cell-wall in the intermediate lamina\r\nof thickened cells or in the cuticle, for it was possible that\r\nthis lamination might be due to subsequent chemical and physical\r\ndifferentiation of membranes thickened by intussusception. As\r\nphytotomists are not yet quite agreed as to the correctness of this\r\nview, we must be content with observing here that in the matter of the\r\ncuticle and the intercellular substance lies one of the points, the\r\ndetermination of which will involve the question of von Mohl’s earlier\r\ntheory of apposition. It is not the purpose of this history to give the\r\nmore modern views that have asserted themselves since 1860, especially\r\nwhere the question is still in debate.\r\n\r\nIt was a part of von Mohl’s idea of the cell-tissue and one to which\r\nhe had firmly adhered since 1828, that except in the cross walls of\r\ngenuine wood-vessels and some very isolated cases the partition-walls\r\nin cellular tissue are never perforated; that both simple and bordered\r\npits always remain closed by the very thin primary lamina of cellulose.\r\nBut between 1850 and 1860 several cases were discovered which were\r\nat once exceptions to von Mohl’s rule, and of great importance to\r\nphysiology. Theodor Hartig, in his ‘Naturgeschichte der forstlichen\r\nKulturpflanzen Deutschlands’ (1851), described peculiar rows of\r\ncells in the bast-system, in which the transverse and sometimes the\r\nlongitudinal walls appear to be pierced like a sieve by numerous\r\nminute holes, and to these cells he gave the name of sieve-tubes.\r\nVon Mohl (1855), while in other points confirming and extending\r\nHartig’s discovery, declared against the perforation of the walls,\r\nbelieving that the appearances were due to lattice-like thickenings\r\nof the cell-walls; he proposed therefore to call Hartig’s sieve-tubes\r\nlatticed cells. Then Nägeli showed in 1861 that in some cases at least\r\nthere can be no doubt that the walls are actually perforated, and\r\nthat the sieve-plates serve for the passage of mucilaginous matter\r\nin bast-tissue, and the author of this history, it may be remarked\r\nin passing in 1863, and Hanstein in 1864, suggested means by which\r\nit may be ascertained with certainty that Hartig’s sieve-plates\r\nare perforated. Meanwhile a number of laticiferous organs had been\r\nrecognised as forms of vessels in von Mohl’s sense, and it was found\r\nthat such canals are produced by dissolution of the septa of adjacent\r\ncells. But the knowledge of the laticiferous organs continued till\r\ntowards 1865 to be very unsettled and defective, and the examination\r\nof resin-passages, and the discovery that they are formed by simple\r\nparting of cells from one another, belong to modern phytotomy;\r\nHanstein, Dippel, N. J. C. Müller, Frank, and others have since\r\n1860 enlarged our knowledge of these forms of tissue. Schacht in\r\n1860 established one of the most important exceptions to von Mohl’s\r\nview above-mentioned, by demonstrating the formation and true form\r\nof bordered pits in the wood of Conifers and in dotted vessels in\r\nAngiosperms from the history of their development, and by showing\r\nmoreover that in all cases where bordered pits are formed on both sides\r\nof a partition-wall and the adjacent cells afterwards convey air, there\r\nthe original very thin partition-wall in the bordered pit disappears,\r\nand that consequently in such cases the bordered pits represent so many\r\nopen holes, through which adjacent cells and vessels communicate. At\r\nthe same time another hitherto inexplicable phenomenon received its\r\nexplanation. Malpighi, and after him the phytotomists at the beginning\r\nof the present century had remarked, that the large vessels in the wood\r\nare not unfrequently filled with parenchymatous cell-tissue, for the\r\norigin of which no one could account. The phenomenon, however, could\r\nnow be explained quite simply after Schacht’s discovery; the formation\r\nof thylosis in vessels only takes place when these border on closed\r\nparenchyma-cells in the wood; when this is the case, the very thin\r\nmembrane which separates the bordered pits from the contiguous cells is\r\nnot absorbed, but it bulges inwards into the cavity of the vessel under\r\nthe pressure of the sap of the neighbouring parenchyma-cell, there\r\nswells up like a bladder, and may by the formation of partition-walls\r\ngive rise to parenchymatous tissue; this, if proceeding from a number\r\nof pits, fills up the cavity of the vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT AND CLASSIFICATION OF TISSUES.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated, that the first step to a real understanding\r\nof the structure as a whole of the higher plants was made by\r\nMoldenhawer, who beginning with the study of the Monocotyledons,\r\nfirst formed an idea of the vascular bundles as a distinct whole, a\r\nsystem composed of various forms of tissue, and applied this idea\r\nto explain the construction of the stems of Dicotyledons, upsetting\r\nthereby Malpighi’s earlier theory of the growth in thickness of stems.\r\nIt was also observed, that von Mohl, advancing further in the same\r\ndirection, gave a more exact description of the epidermis and of the\r\ntissues connected with it, and classified them, that is, introduced\r\na terminology founded on real investigation, but did not succeed in\r\nbringing the subject to an entirely satisfactory conclusion; this could\r\nin fact be reached only by the study of the history of development,\r\nthe only decisive method of investigation, whether the object be\r\nto determine the true nature of cells and their subordinate forms,\r\nor the solid fabric of vegetable structure, or as in the present\r\ncase to distinguish and classify forms of tissue; it is this method\r\nwhich supplies the morphological points of view necessary for the\r\nunderstanding of the inner structure of the plant by investigating\r\ntissues in those states of development, in which they are not yet\r\nadapted to subsequent physiological functions. The combination of\r\nmorphological and physiological points of view in the determination of\r\nfacts has maintained itself longer in this part of botanical study than\r\nin any other; but here too ideas and opinions were gradually sifted and\r\ncleared up under the influence of the modern study of the history of\r\ndevelopment, though it was not till after 1850 that the determination\r\nof the chief points in the theory of cell-formation left the leading\r\nphytotomists at liberty to devote themselves to histological questions.\r\n\r\nHow little advance had been made towards the true understanding of\r\nthe varieties of forms of tissue in the higher plants before 1850 is\r\nshown, for instance, by Schleiden’s account of tissues on page 232 of\r\nhis ‘Grundzüge’ of 1845, where parenchyma, intercellular substance,\r\nvessels, vascular bundles, bast-tissue, bast-cells in Apocyneae and\r\nAsclepiadeae, laticiferous vessels, felted tissue, epidermal tissue,\r\nare discussed in this succession in co-ordinated sections of the text.\r\nIt is obvious that no well-ordered view of the whole cellular structure\r\nof a plant of the higher order could be obtained in this way. Further\r\non in the same work, where Schleiden attempts a classification of\r\nvascular bundles, which he distinguishes into closed and open, and\r\nassigns the latter to Dicotyledons, we find the cambium-layer named as\r\nthe outer boundary of these open vascular bundles; the bast which lies\r\noutside the cambium was therefore not considered to be a part of the\r\nopen vascular bundles, and this necessarily excluded any profitable\r\ncomparison of the circumstances in Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons.\r\nThe case is still worse in many respects in Schacht’s work already\r\nmentioned, ‘Die Pflanzenzelle’ of 1852, where under the heading ‘Kinds\r\nof vegetable cells’ the histology is discussed in the following\r\nco-ordinated sections; the swarm-filaments of Cryptogams, the spores of\r\nthe same, pollen-grains, cells and tissue of Fungi and Lichens, cells\r\nand tissue of Algae, parenchyma and its cells, vessels of the plant,\r\nwood and its cells, bast-cells, stomata, appendicular organs of the\r\nepidermis, cork; then follows a paragraph on the thickening-ring, and\r\nthen to the no small astonishment of the reader comes an account of the\r\nvascular bundles, after the vessels, the wood, and the bast-cells have\r\nbeen already dismissed. That such a mode of presenting the subject is\r\ndue to the little insight possessed by the writer into the structure of\r\nthe plant as a whole is apparent from simply reading the book, and a\r\nsimilar confusion of ideas is found in his text-book of 1856.\r\n\r\nWe find a much better classification of tissues in 1855 in Unger’s\r\n‘Anatomie und Physiologie der Pflanzen’; an account of cells is\r\nfollowed by a description of cell-complexes, as one of the chief\r\ndivisions of the book, and herein of cell-families, cell-tissues, and\r\ncell-fusions. Another chief section is occupied with cell-groups,\r\nand here epidermal formations, air-spaces, sap-receptacles, glands\r\nand vascular bundles are noticed; here certainly the fact has been\r\noverlooked that vascular bundles may be co-ordinated with epidermal\r\nformations, but not air-spaces, sap-receptacles and glands. His last\r\nchief division gives an account of tissue-systems and of the way in\r\nwhich the vascular bundles are united together in different plants, and\r\nsecondary growth in thickness and the activity of the cambium-layer are\r\ndescribed quite in the right connection.\r\n\r\nIn this branch of the science, as in every case where it is a question\r\nof establishing fundamental conceptions, of surveying facts from\r\nextensive points of view, and of seeking the requisite principles\r\nby means of the history of development, we find that it is Nägeli\r\nwho opens the way and lays the foundation. In his ‘Beiträge zur\r\nwissenschaftlichen Botanik’ of 1858, he proposed a classification\r\nof tissues from purely morphological points of view. His first\r\ndivision was into generating and permanent tissue; in each section\r\nhe distinguished two forms, prosenchymatous and parenchymatous\r\ntissue. Parenchymatous generating tissue, the original component of\r\nevery young organ, he named primary meristem as distinguished from\r\nprosenchymatous generating tissue, which is differentiated in the\r\nform of strands and layers, and received from him the general name of\r\ncambium; this was certainly not a happy distinction, because Nägeli’s\r\ncambium by no means consists entirely of prosenchymatous tissue. By\r\nthe term secondary meristem Nägeli designated the tissue-strands and\r\ntissue-layers which are formed between the permanent tissue of older\r\nparts. The cambium he regards as the first product of the primary\r\nmeristem. The second chief form, permanent tissue, he divides into\r\ntwo classes, not according to the form of the cells or physiological\r\nrelations, but according to its origin; all permanent tissue, which\r\nis derived immediately from primary meristem, is protenchyma, all\r\nthat comes directly or indirectly from cambium is epenchyma. And\r\nsince the tissue-strands, till then known as vascular bundles, do not\r\ncontain vessels only but always fibrous elements also, as Bernhardi\r\nhad shown in 1805, Nägeli thought that they should therefore be\r\ncalled fibrovascular strands. If it cannot be denied that the obvious\r\ndistinction between epidermal and other tissue did not find suitable\r\nexpression in this classification, and though other points of view\r\nmay at the present day be proposed for the genetic arrangement of\r\ntissues, yet Nägeli’s classification and terminology have the merit of\r\nhaving for the first time exhibited the general histology of plants\r\non comprehensive and genetic principles. It contributed materially to\r\nimpart a better understanding of the collective structure of plants.\r\n\r\nThe vascular bundles or fibrovascular strands especially demanded\r\nfurther investigation of the genetic and morphological kind; for a\r\ncorrect insight into the origin and subsequent transformation of this\r\ntissue-system is as important for phytotomy as a similar knowledge with\r\nrespect to the bony system in vertebrate animals is for zootomy. But\r\na knowledge of the vascular bundles and their course in the stem has\r\na special importance in phytotomy, because it is the only way to the\r\nunderstanding of secondary growth in thickness in true woody plants.\r\n\r\nIt was noticed above, that von Mohl had proved in 1831 the separate\r\ncharacter of the bundles which begin in the stem and bend outwards into\r\nthe leaves where they end, so that the entire system of bundles in a\r\nplant consists of single bundles isolated when formed and subsequently\r\nbrought into connection with one another. Nägeli had already examined\r\nthe corresponding circumstances in the vascular Cryptogams in 1846,\r\nwhen Schacht took the retrograde step of making the vascular system in\r\nthe plant originate in repeated branching, instead of in subsequent\r\nblending of isolated strands; Mohl declared unhesitatingly against this\r\nmistake in 1858, but it was refuted at greater length and still more\r\nclearly by Johannes Hanstein in 1857, and by Nägeli in 1858. Hanstein\r\nin a treatise on the structure of the ring of wood in Dicotyledons\r\nconfirmed Nägeli’s previous statements, and proved in the case of\r\nDicotyledons and Conifers that the first woody circle in the stem is\r\nformed from a number of vascular bundles, which are identical with\r\nthose of the leaves and originate in the primary meristem of the bud.\r\nThese primordial bundles pass downwards through a certain number of\r\ninternodes in the stem independent and separate, and either retain\r\ntheir isolation to the point where they end below or unite with\r\nadjacent bundles which originated lower down. Hanstein happily termed\r\nthe portions of the vascular bundles, which enter the stem from the\r\nbase of the leaf and traverse a certain portion of it in a downward\r\ndirection, leaf-traces, so that it may be stated briefly, that the\r\nprimary wood-cylinder in Dicotyledons and Conifers consists of the sum\r\nof the leaf-traces. Nägeli’s observations were of a more comprehensive\r\ncharacter, and supplied, as we have seen, a terminology for tissues.\r\nHe distinguished three kinds of vascular bundles according to their\r\ncourse; the common bundles, which represent Hanstein’s leaf-traces in\r\nthe stem, and whose upper ends bend outwards into the leaves; the\r\ncauline bundles, which extend above to the punctum vegetationis of the\r\nstem without bending outwards into leaves; and leaf-bundles, which\r\nbelong to the leaves only. He laid it down as a general rule as regards\r\nthe common bundles in Dicotyledons and Conifers that they begin to form\r\nwhere their ascending and descending halves meet, at the spot therefore\r\nwhere they bend outwards into the leaf, and continue to form as they\r\ndescend into the stem and ascend into the leaf by differentiation of\r\nsuitable tissue. It follows from the nature of these common bundles,\r\nthat a more thorough understanding of their course and origin\r\npresupposes a more accurate knowledge of the order of formation of the\r\nleaves at the end of the stem and of the changes in the phyllotaxis\r\nduring growth; these relations Nägeli took into detailed consideration,\r\nand even derived from them new points of view for the examination of\r\nthe genetic arrangement of leaves, pointing out at the same time the\r\nunsatisfactory nature of the principles of the doctrine propounded\r\nby Schimper and Braun. Nägeli was also the first who compared the\r\nanatomical structure of roots with that of stems, and drew attention to\r\nthe peculiar character of the fibrovascular body in these organs. As\r\nhis previous discovery of the apical cell and its segmentation promoted\r\nfurther research, so now his treatise on fibrovascular strands called\r\nforth many others from various quarters; among them that of Carl Sanio\r\non the composition of the wood (‘Botanische Zeitung,’ 1863) must be\r\nmentioned as one of the first and most important, and as serving in\r\nconjunction with the works of Hanstein and Nägeli to throw light upon\r\nthe processes of growth in thickness of stems. It has been already\r\nsaid that neither von Mohl nor Schleiden, neither Schacht nor Unger\r\nsucceeded in finding the true explanation of growth in thickness. It\r\nwas impossible that they should do so, for they were insufficiently\r\nacquainted with the origin, true course, and composition of the\r\nvascular bundles before growth in thickness commences; the study of\r\nthe subject was greatly perplexed by the confounding together in\r\nthought and language of totally different things which came under\r\nconsideration, the so-called thickening-ring, in which the first\r\nvascular bundles were supposed to originate close under the summit\r\nof the stem, being confounded with the cambium of true woody plants\r\nwhich is formed at a much later period, and both of them again with\r\nthe very late-formed meristem-layer in arborescent Liliaceae, in\r\nwhich new vascular bundles are continually being produced and cause a\r\npeculiar enlargement of the stem[89]. Sanio’s treatise first removed\r\nthis confusion of ideas, which appears in von Mohl himself to some\r\nextent even in 1858, by sharply distinguishing the thickening-ring\r\nbeneath the point of the stem, in which the vascular bundles begin to\r\nbe formed, from the true cambium, which is formed at a later time in\r\nand between the vascular bundles, and produces the secondary layers of\r\nwood and rind; Sanio also occupied himself with submitting the various\r\nelements of the wood to a more careful examination, and with giving\r\nthem a better classification and terminology. The peculiar instance\r\nof secondary growth in thickness in the arborescent Liliaceae, which\r\nhad long been known and had helped to mislead von Mohl and Schacht,\r\nwas fully explained for the first time by A. Millardet in 1865. The\r\nlater works of Nägeli, Radlkofer, Eichler and others on abnormal\r\nwood-formations contributed materially to enlarge the knowledge of\r\nnormal growth also; but these coming after 1860, and Hanstein’s later\r\ninvestigations into the differentiation of tissues at the end of the\r\nstem in Phanerogams, do not fall within the limits of our history.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. NÄGELI’S THEORY OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE AND OF GROWTH BY\r\nINTUSSUSCEPTION.\r\n\r\nThis theory, the importance of which to the further development of\r\nphytotomy and vegetable physiology has been already pointed out,\r\nwill form the conclusion of our history of the anatomy of plants. It\r\nwas a remarkable coincidence that this molecular theory of organic\r\nforms, which is not without results for zootomy also, was brought\r\nto completion at about the same time, namely, the year 1860, that\r\nDarwin first published his theory of descent. At the first glance\r\nthe two theories seem to have no connection with one another, and so\r\nthe coincidence in time appears to be quite accidental. But if we\r\ngo deeper into the matter, we find a resemblance between them which\r\nis of great historical importance; they both of them exchange the\r\npurely formal consideration of organic bodies, which had prevailed\r\nup to that time, for a consideration of causes; as Darwin’s doctrine\r\nendeavours to account for the specific forms of animals and plants from\r\nthe principles of inheritance and variability under the disturbing\r\nor favouring influence of external circumstances, so the object of\r\nNägeli’s theory is to refer the growth and inner structure of organised\r\nbodies to chemical and mechanical processes. The future will show,\r\nwhether the views which we owe to Nägeli will not contribute to the\r\nlaying a deeper foundation for the theory of descent, since it is\r\nnot improbable that a more thorough understanding of the molecular\r\nstructure of organisms may add light and certainty to the still obscure\r\nconceptions of inheritance and variation.\r\n\r\nThe first beginnings were, as is usual in similar cases, small\r\nand inappreciable, and no one could have foreseen from the first\r\nobservations of the facts in question what the ultimate development\r\nwould be. We have said above, that von Mohl observed as early as\r\n1836 the striation of certain cell-walls, and that this led Meyen,\r\non the ground of further but to some extent inaccurate observations,\r\nto conceive of vegetable cell-walls as composed of spirally twisted\r\nthreads. It was also noticed that von Mohl next distinguished true\r\nstriation from spiral thickenings (1837), the two having been confused\r\ntogether by Meyen, and advanced so far as to form some idea of the\r\nmolecular structure of cell-walls, without arriving however at any\r\nsatisfactory conclusion. Agardh, who discovered some new instances\r\nof cell-striation, was still less successful in his speculations.\r\nVon Mohl resumed the subject in 1853 in the ‘Botanische Zeitung,’\r\nand insisted on the fact that it was not possible to separate the\r\nstriae or apparent fibres by mechanical or chemical means, but he\r\nleft it still undecided whether the lines which cross each other\r\nin the surface-view belong to the same or to different layers of\r\nmembrane. The communications of Crüger and Schacht, made shortly\r\nafter, did not help to advance the question; Wigand also took part\r\nin the discussion in 1856, but wandered at once from the right path\r\nby supposing the cross-striations to belong to different layers of\r\nmembrane. As long as botanists adhered to von Mohl’s theory, that\r\nthe concentric stratification of cell-walls was due to deposition of\r\nnew layers, it was scarcely possible for them to arrive at a correct\r\ndecision with respect to striation; it became possible, when Nägeli\r\nproved in his great work ‘Die Stärkekörner’ (1858) that the concentric\r\nstratification of starch-grains and of cell-membranes generally does\r\nnot mean, that similar layers lie simply one on another, but that\r\ndenser and less watery layers alternate with layers that are less\r\ndense and contain more water; and that it is not possible to explain\r\nthis mode of stratification by deposition as understood by von Mohl,\r\nbut that it may be explained by intercalation of new molecules between\r\nthe old ones and by corresponding differentiation of the amount of\r\nwater. That surface-growth in cell-walls does take place by this kind\r\nof intussusception had been incidentally suggested by Unger, and\r\nthe appearance, known as the striation of the cell-wall might now\r\nbe referred to the same principle as the concentric stratification,\r\nnamely to the intercalation of more and less watery matter in regular\r\nalternation. But Nägeli pointed out a fact which had escaped other\r\nobservers, namely, that the difference of structure which usually\r\nappears on the surface-view as double cross-striation, passes through\r\nthe whole thickness of a stratified cell-wall. Thus Nägeli arrived\r\nat a differentiation in three directions in space of the substance\r\nof every minute portion of cell-membrane, and made better use than\r\nvon Mohl himself had made of the comparison which he had suggested,\r\nnamely, that the structure of a cell-wall with cross-striation and\r\nat the same time with concentric stratification resembles that of a\r\ncrystal cleaving in three directions. He first gave expression to this\r\nconception of the structure of the cell-wall in 1862 in his ‘Botanische\r\nUntersuchungen,’ I. p. 187, and further developed it in the second\r\nvolume of the same work at p. 147.\r\n\r\nBut the true starting-point of Nägeli’s theory of molecular structure\r\nis to be found in his searching investigations in 1858, into the\r\nconstitution of starch-grains. From the way in which they resist the\r\neffects of pressure, drying, distention, and withdrawal of a part of\r\ntheir substance, he arrived at the conclusion that the whole substance\r\nof a starch-grain is composed of molecules, whose shape must be not\r\nspherical but polyhedral, that these are separated from one another\r\nin their normal condition by envelopes of water, and that the amount\r\nof water in the stratified substance depends on the size of these\r\nmolecules, the water being less when the molecules are larger; this\r\nview could at once be applied to the structure of the cell-wall,\r\nthe growth of which may be explained as the increase in size of the\r\nmolecules already present, and the intercalation of new small molecules\r\nbetween the old ones. These molecules of Nägeli are themselves very\r\ncompound bodies, for the smallest of them would consist of numerous\r\natoms of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, and ordinarily a molecule would\r\nbe composed of thousands of those aggregates of atoms, which the\r\nchemists call molecules.\r\n\r\nIn examining starch-grains Nägeli came to the conclusion that molecules\r\nof different chemical character are grouped together at every visible\r\npoint; the material which colours blue with iodine, the granulose,\r\ncould be removed from the grains, and then there remained behind a\r\nskeleton of the starch-grain very poor in substance, but showing\r\nexactly the original stratification and giving no blue colour with\r\niodine; this Nägeli named starch-cellulose. It followed from this\r\nbehaviour, that two chemically different molecules lie everywhere side\r\nby side in the grain of starch, much as if red and yellow bricks had\r\nbeen so employed to build a house, that when all the yellow bricks\r\nwere afterwards removed, the red alone would still represent the\r\nwall in its original form as a whole though in a looser condition.\r\nHe arrived at similar results in the case of the crystalloid proteid\r\nbodies, which Theodor Hartig discovered, and Radlkofer had examined\r\ncrystallographically, Maschke chemically. Since it is possible in\r\nthe same manner to extract the so-called incrusting matters from\r\ncell-membranes without essentially altering their form, and to obtain\r\nash-skeletons of them which imitate all the delicacies of their\r\nstructure, the comparison adopted above may also be applied in still\r\nmore complex manner to the molecular structure of these membranes;\r\nand indeed many considerations lead to the belief, that the ideas\r\nwhich Nägeli obtained from starch-grains may be applied with some\r\nmodifications to the structure of protoplasm also.\r\n\r\nWe said that the appearances in the starch-grains led Nägeli to suppose\r\nthat their molecules are not spherical but polyhedral, and the question\r\nnaturally arose whether they are really crystalline. The point could\r\nbe settled by the use of polarised light, to which different observers\r\nhad already turned their attention. Erlach in 1847, Ehrenberg in 1849,\r\nhad employed polarised light for the determination of microscopic\r\nobjects, without however arriving at any conclusions on the subject\r\nof molecular structure; Schacht indeed at a later time declared\r\nsuch observations to be a pretty amusement, but without scientific\r\nvalue. But soon we have once more one of von Mohl’s careful and solid\r\ninvestigations (‘Botanische Zeitung,’ 1858), in which with the aid\r\nof technical improvements in the apparatus he arrived at conclusions\r\nrespecting the nature and substance of cell-membranes, starch-grains,\r\n&c., which proved that in the hands of a reflecting observer perfectly\r\nfamiliar with the physics of polarised light the instrument is no\r\ntoy, but a means for penetrating deeply into nature’s secrets. Yet on\r\nthis occasion also appeared that peculiarity in von Mohl which twenty\r\nyears before had prevented him from founding a conclusive theory upon\r\nhis profound and extended observations on cell-formation; he was\r\ncontent once more to observe thoroughly and correctly, to describe\r\nwhat he observed carefully, and to connect it with proximate physical\r\nprinciples in such a manner as to supply rather a classification of\r\nphenomena, than a new and deeper insight into the essence of the\r\nmatter. He wanted the creative thought, the intense mental effort,\r\nto arrive by analysis at the ultimate elements in the results of his\r\ninvestigations and to frame for himself a clear representation of\r\nthe inner structure of the organised parts. Von Mohl in this case\r\nalso stopped short at induction and did not pass on to deductive and\r\nconstructive elaboration of the question before him; this was left to\r\nNägeli, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a more exhaustive work appeared in 1861 from the pen of\r\nValentin on the investigation of vegetable and animal tissue in\r\npolarised light, in which the author, equipped with great knowledge of\r\nthe subject itself and its literature, examined in detail the phenomena\r\nof polarisation, gave a good account of the instrument and the mode\r\nof using it, and explained generally the theory and practice of\r\ninvestigations of the kind. But he overlooked one fact noticed by von\r\nMohl, that vegetable cell-membranes, through which rays of polarised\r\nlight pass perpendicularly to their surface, show interference-colours,\r\nand this was sure to lead him to an incorrect explanation of their\r\ninner structure.\r\n\r\nNägeli from 1859 onwards made the phenomena of polarisation the\r\nsubject of protracted study, practical and theoretical; the results\r\nwere published in 1863 in his ‘Beiträge,’ Heft 3, but he had in the\r\nprevious year made known that portion of them which bore on the\r\nmolecular structure of cell-walls and starch-grains (‘Botanische\r\nMittheilungen,’ 1862). The phenomena of polarisation led him once\r\nmore and by a different path to the view that the organised parts\r\nof the vegetable cell consist of isolated molecules surrounded by a\r\nfluid, and his renewed investigations of these phenomena resulted in\r\nmore definite conceptions of the nature of these molecules, which\r\nfrom the optical behaviour of the objects examined he concluded were\r\nnot only polyhedral but crystalline; in effect, the molecules of\r\nthe substance of the organised parts of plants behave, according to\r\nNägeli, as crystals with two optic axes, which therefore possess three\r\ndifferent axes of elasticity; in starch-grains and cell-membranes these\r\ncrystalline molecules are so arranged that one of these axes is always\r\nperpendicular to the stratification, while the two others lie in its\r\nplane. The effect of the organised parts of the cells on polarised\r\nlight is the sum of the effects of the single molecules, whereas the\r\nfluid that lies between them is optically inactive, and only comes into\r\nconsideration because according to its quantity the molecules separate\r\nmore or less far from or approach one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THIRD BOOK\r\n\r\n                    HISTORY OF VEGETABLE PHYSIOLOGY\r\n\r\n                              (1583-1860)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that was known in the 16th and at the beginning of the 17th\r\ncenturies of the phenomena of life in plants was scarcely more than\r\nhad been learnt in the earliest times of human civilisation from\r\nagriculture, gardening, and other practical dealing with plants. It was\r\nknown, for instance, that the roots serve to fix plants in the soil and\r\nto supply them with food; that certain kinds of manure, such as ashes\r\nand, under certain conditions, salt, strengthen vegetation; that buds\r\ndevelope into shoots; and that the blossom precedes the production\r\nof seeds and fruits. These and a variety of minor physiological\r\nphenomena were disclosed by the art of gardening. On the other hand,\r\nthe physiological importance of leaves in the nourishment of plants\r\nwas quite unknown, nor can we discover more than a very indistinct\r\nperception of the connection between the stamens and the production of\r\nfruitful seeds. That the food-material taken up from the soil must move\r\ninside the plant in order to nourish the upper parts was an obvious\r\nconclusion, which it was attempted to explain by comparing it with the\r\nmovement of the blood in animals. Writers on the subject up to the end\r\nof the 17th century make very slight mention of the influence of light\r\nand warmth on the sustentation and growth of plants, though doubtless\r\nthe operation of these agencies in the cultivation of plants, as in\r\nother matters, must have been early recognised.\r\n\r\nSo scanty was the stock of knowledge which the founders of vegetable\r\nphysiology in the latter half of the 17th century found ready to their\r\nhand. While the physiological significance of the different organs of\r\nthe human body and of most animals were known to every one, at least\r\nin their more obvious features, the study of vegetable life had to\r\nbegin with laborious enquiries, whether the different parts of plants\r\nare generally necessary to their maintenance and propagation, and\r\nwhat functions must be ascribed to individual parts for the good of\r\nthe whole. It was no easy matter to make the first step in advance in\r\nthis subject; something can be learnt of the functions of the parts\r\nof animals from direct observation, scarcely anything in the case of\r\nplants; and it is only necessary to read Cesalpino and the herbals\r\nof the 16th century to see how helpless the botanists were in every\r\ncase in presence of questions concerning the possible physiological\r\nmeaning of vegetable organs, when they ventured beyond the conceptions\r\nof the root as the organ of nourishment, and of the fruit and seeds\r\nas the supposed ultimate object of vegetable life. The physiological\r\narrangements in vegetable organs are not obvious to the eye; they\r\nmust be concluded from certain incidental circumstances, or logically\r\ndeduced from the result of experiments. But experiment presupposes the\r\nproposing a definite question resting on a hypothesis; and questions\r\nand hypotheses can only arise from previous knowledge. An early attempt\r\nto connect the subject with existing knowledge was made in the use\r\nof the comparison of vegetable with animal life, a comparison which\r\nAristotle had employed with small success. Cesalpino, provided with\r\nmore botanical and zoological knowledge, endeavoured to arrive at more\r\ndefinite ideas of the movement of the nutrient juices in plants, and\r\nwhen Harvey discovered the circulation of the blood in the beginning of\r\nthe 17th century, the idea at once arose that there might be a similar\r\ncirculation of the sap in plants. Thus a first hypothesis, a definite\r\nquestion was framed, and attempts were made to decide it by more exact\r\nobservation of the ordinary phenomena of vegetation, and still better\r\nby experiment; and though a discussion which lasted nearly a hundred\r\nyears led to the opinion that there is no circulation of sap in plants\r\ncorresponding to the circulation of blood in animals, the result was\r\nobtained by the aid of this hypothesis derived from a comparison\r\nbetween animals and plants. The important discovery that leaves play\r\na considerable part in the nourishment of plants, was to some extent\r\nan incidental product of the investigation of the former question, and\r\nit preceded that of the decomposition of carbon dioxide by the green\r\nparts of plants by more than a hundred years. To give another example;\r\nit was obviously a comparison of certain phenomena in vegetable life\r\nwith the propagation of animals which paved the way for the discovery\r\nof sexuality in plants; long before Rudolf Jacob Camerarius made his\r\ndecisive experiments (1691-1694) on the necessary co-operation of the\r\npollen in the production of seeds capable of germination, the idea\r\nhad been entertained that there might be an arrangement in plants\r\ncorresponding to the sexual relation in animals, though that idea was\r\nhighly indistinct and distorted by various prepossessions. In like\r\nmanner the interest excited by the discovery of the irritability of\r\nthe Mimosae in the 17th century, and of similar phenomena of movement\r\nin plants at a later time, was mainly due to the striking resemblance\r\nsuggested between animals and plants; and the first researches into\r\nthe subject were obviously intended to answer the question whether\r\nthe movements in plants are due to conditions of organisation similar\r\nto those in animals. In all cases of this kind it was matter of\r\nindifference whether the analogies presupposed were finally confirmed\r\nafter prolonged investigation, as in the question of sexuality, or\r\ndisproved as in that of the circulation of the sap. The result was\r\nof less importance than the obtaining points of departure for the\r\ninvestigation. It answered this purpose to adopt certain actual or only\r\napparent analogies between plants and animals, and to assume, to some\r\nextent to invent, certain functions for the apparently inactive organs\r\nof plants, and to interrogate them upon the point. Scientific activity\r\nwas set in motion, and it mattered not what the result might be. In\r\nall questions connected with the phenomena of life, our own life is not\r\nonly the starting-point but also the standard of our conceptions; what\r\nanimate nature is as opposed to inanimate we discern first by comparing\r\nour own being with that of other objects. From our own vital motions we\r\nargue to those of the higher animals, which we comprehend immediately\r\nand instinctively from their conduct; by aid of these the motions\r\nof the lower animals also become intelligible to us, and further\r\nconclusions from analogy lead us finally to plants, whose vitality\r\nis only in this way made known to us. While plants were thus even in\r\nancient times regarded as living creatures and allied to animals,\r\nfurther reflection naturally suggested the idea that the phenomena of\r\nanimal life would be reproduced in plants even in details. We learn\r\nfrom the botanical fragments of Aristotle that this was in fact the\r\nway in which the first questions in vegetable physiology arose; they\r\nassumed a more definite form with Cesalpino, and later physiologists\r\nrepeatedly made use of similar conclusions from analogy. The historian\r\nof this branch of botanical science must seek no other beginning of\r\nit, for it had no other and could have no other from the nature of\r\nthe case. And if preconceived analogies between plants and animals\r\noften proved deceptive and mischievous, yet continued investigation\r\ngradually brought to light more important and more essential points of\r\nagreement between the two kingdoms; it has become more and more evident\r\nin our own days, that the material foundations of vegetable and animal\r\nlife are in the main identical,—that the processes connected with\r\nnourishment, movement of juices, sexual and asexual propagation present\r\nthe most remarkable similarities in both kingdoms.\r\n\r\nIf the first founders of scientific vegetable physiology surrendered\r\nthemselves thoroughly to teleological views, this was owing to the\r\ncircumstances of the time, and it served indeed to promote the\r\nfirst advances of the science. There was no need in the 17th and\r\n18th centuries that a man should be an Aristotelian to presuppose\r\ndesign and arrangements in conformity with design in all parts of\r\nphysiological investigation. This is everywhere and always the original\r\npoint of view which precedes all philosophy; but it is the part of\r\nadvanced science to abandon this position; and as early as the 17th\r\ncentury philosophers recognised the fact that the teleological mode\r\nof proceeding is unscientific. But the first vegetable physiologists\r\nwere not philosophers in the stricter sense of the word, and in their\r\ninvestigations they accepted the teleological conception of organic\r\nnature without question, because they regarded it as a self-evident\r\nfact, that every organ must be purposely and exactly so made as to be\r\nin a condition to perform the functions necessary for the permanence\r\nof the whole organism. This conception was in accordance with views\r\nthen prevailing, and was even useful; it was no disadvantage in the\r\nfirst beginnings of the science, that it should be supposed that\r\nevery, even the minutest, part of a plant was expressly contrived\r\nand made for maintaining its life, for this was a strong motive for\r\ncarefully examining the organs of plants, which was the first thing\r\nrequisite. This is exemplified in Malpighi, Grew, and Hales, and\r\nwe shall see that even towards the end of the 17th century Konrad\r\nSprengel made splendid discoveries respecting the relations of the\r\nstructure of the flower to the insect world, while strictly carrying\r\nout his teleological principles. The teleological view was injurious\r\nto the progress of morphology from the first, though the history\r\nof systematic botany shows how hard it was for botanists to free\r\nthemselves from such notions. The case was different with physiology;\r\nso long as it was a question of discovering the functions of organs,\r\nand learning the connection between the phenomena of life, teleology\r\nproved highly useful if only as a principle of research. But it was\r\nanother matter when it became requisite to investigate causes, and to\r\ngrasp the phenomena of vegetation in their causal connection. To this\r\nthe teleological mode of view was inadequate, and it became necessary\r\nindeed to discard it as a hindrance, in spite of the difficulty of\r\nexplaining adaptation in the arrangements of organisms from any other\r\nthan the teleological point of view. It is sufficient here to say that\r\nthis difficulty is satisfactorily removed by the theory of selection.\r\nThis theory is become as important in this respect to physiology, as\r\nthe theory of descent is to systematic botany and morphology. If the\r\ntheory of descent finally liberated the morphological treatment of\r\norganisms from the influence of scholasticism, it is the theory of\r\nselection which has made it possible for physiology to set herself free\r\nfrom teleological explanations. Only an entire misunderstanding of the\r\nDarwinian doctrine can allow anyone to reproach it with falling back\r\ninto teleology; its greatest merit is to have made teleology appear\r\nsuperfluous, where it seemed to naturalists in former times, in spite\r\nof all philosophical objections, to be indispensable.\r\n\r\nIf the comparison of plants with animals as well as the teleological\r\nconception of organisms promoted the first attempts at the\r\nphysiological investigation of plants, other influences of decisive\r\nimportance came into play when the time came for endeavouring to\r\nconceive and explain the causes and conditions of the functions, which\r\nhad then been ascertained at least in their most obvious features.\r\nPhytotomy was here the chief resource. In proportion as the inner\r\nstructure of plants was better known and the different kinds of tissue\r\nbetter distinguished, it became possible to bring the functions of\r\norgans, as made known by experiment, into connection with their\r\nmicroscopic structure; phytotomy dissected the living machine into its\r\ncomponent parts, and could then leave it to physiology to discover from\r\nthe structure and contents of the tissues, how far they were adapted to\r\nperform definite functions. Obviously this only became possible when\r\nthe phenomena of vegetation had been previously studied in the living\r\nplant. For example, the microscopic examination of the processes\r\nwhich take place in fertilisation could first be made to yield further\r\nconclusions, after sexuality itself, the necessity of the pollen to\r\nthe production of fruitful seeds, had been proved by experiment; in\r\nthe same way the anatomical investigation of wood could only supply\r\nmaterial for explaining the mode in which water rises in it, when it\r\nhad first been ascertained by experiment that this happens only in the\r\nwood, and so in other cases.\r\n\r\nThe relation between physiology and physics and chemistry suggests\r\nsimilar considerations; it is necessary to make some preliminary\r\nremarks in explanation of this relation, because we often meet with\r\nthe view, especially in modern times, that vegetable physiology is\r\nvirtually only applied physics and chemistry, as though the phenomena\r\nof life could be simply deduced from physical and chemical doctrines.\r\nThis might perhaps be possible, if physics and chemistry had no further\r\nquestions to solve in their own domains; but in fact both are still\r\nas far distant from this goal, as physiology is from hers. It is true\r\nindeed, that modern vegetable physiology would be impossible without\r\nmodern physics and chemistry, as the earlier science had to rely on\r\nthe aid of the physics and chemistry of the day, when she was engaged\r\nin forming a conception of ascertained vital phenomena as operations\r\nof known causes. But it is equally true, that no advance which physics\r\nand chemistry have made up to the present time would have produced\r\nany system of vegetable physiology, even with the aid of phytotomy;\r\nhistory shows that a series of vital phenomena in plants had been\r\nrecognised in the 17th and 18th century, at a time when physics and\r\nchemistry had little to offer, and were in no condition to supply\r\nexplanations of any kind to the physiologist. The true foundation of\r\nall physiology is the direct observation of vital phenomena; these must\r\nbe evoked or altered by experiment, and studied in their connection,\r\nbefore they can be referred to physical and chemical causes. It is\r\ntherefore quite possible for vegetable physiology to have reached a\r\ncertain stage of development without any explanation of the phenomena\r\nof vegetation from physics or chemistry, and even in spite of erroneous\r\ntheories on those subjects. What Malpighi, Hales, and to some extent\r\nDu Hamel produced, was really vegetable physiology, and of a better\r\nkind than some moderns are inclined to believe; and their knowledge was\r\nderived from observations on living plants, and not from the chemical\r\nand physical theories of their time. The discovery even of important\r\nfacts, for example, that green leaves only can form the food suitable\r\nto effect the growth and formation of new organs, was made a hundred\r\nyears before that of the decomposition of carbon dioxide by the green\r\nparts of plants, at a time indeed when chemistry knew nothing of carbon\r\ndioxide and oxygen. A whole series of physiological discoveries might\r\nbe mentioned, which were distinctly opposed to chemical and physical\r\ntheories, and even served to correct them. We may give as examples,\r\nthe establishment of the facts that roots absorb water and the\r\nmaterials of food without giving up anything in return, which seemed\r\nquite unintelligible on the earlier physical theory of the endosmotic\r\nequivalent; and that the so-called chemical rays of the physicists are\r\nof subordinate importance in vegetable assimilation, while contrary\r\nto the prevailing notions of physicists and chemists the yellow\r\nportions of the spectrum and those adjacent to it actively promote the\r\ndecomposition of carbon dioxide. From what doctrines of the physicists\r\ncould it have been concluded, that the downward growth of roots and the\r\nupward growth of stems was due to gravitation, as Knight proved in 1806\r\nby experiments on living plants; or could optics have foreseen that\r\nthe growth of plants is retarded by light, and that growing parts are\r\ncurved under its influence. Our best knowledge of the life of plants\r\nhas been obtained by direct observation, not deduced from chemical and\r\nphysical theories. After these preliminary remarks we may proceed to\r\ngive a rapid survey of the progress of vegetable physiology.\r\n\r\n1. That the first beginnings of vegetable physiology were made about\r\nthe time that chemistry and physics began to take their place among\r\nthe true natural sciences, is no proof that they called vegetable\r\nphysiology into existence. She, like general physiology, mineralogy,\r\nastronomy, geography, owed her origin to the outburst of the spirit of\r\nenquiry in the 16th and 17th centuries, which feeling the emptiness\r\nof the scholastic philosophy set itself to gather valuable knowledge\r\nby observation in every direction. It was in the second half of the\r\n17th century that societies or academies for the study of the natural\r\nsciences were founded in Italy, England, Germany, and France under the\r\ninfluence of this feeling; the first works on vegetable physiology\r\nplay a very prominent part in their transactions; not to speak of less\r\nimportant cases, it was the Royal Society of London which published\r\nbetween 1660 and 1690 the memorable works of Malpighi and Grew; the\r\nfirst communications of Camerarius, which form an epoch in the history\r\nof the doctrine of sexuality, appeared in the journals of the German\r\nAcademia Naturae Curiosorum, and the French Academy undertook about the\r\nsame time to organise methodical researches in vegetable physiology\r\nunder Dodart’s direction, though the results it is true did not answer\r\nto the goodness of the intention. This period of movement in all\r\nbranches of science, when the greatest discoveries followed one another\r\nwith marvellous rapidity, witnessed also the first important advances\r\nin vegetable physiology; such were the first investigations into\r\nthe ascending and descending sap, especially those made in England,\r\nMalpighi’s theory which assigned to leaves the functions of organs of\r\nnutriment, Ray’s first communications on the influence of light on\r\nthe colours of plants, and above all the experiments of Camerarius,\r\nwhich proved the fertilising power of the pollen. It was the period of\r\nfirst discoveries; the attempts at explanation were certainly weak;\r\nbut phytotomy which was just commencing its own work lent aid from\r\nthe first to physiology, while physics and chemistry could do but\r\nlittle for her. On the other hand, the predilection for mechanics\r\nand mechanical explanation of organic processes in Newton’s age bore\r\nfair fruit in Hales’ enquiries into the movement of sap in plants;\r\nhis ‘Statical Essays’ of 1727 connect closely with the works before\r\nmentioned which had laid the foundations of the science, and with\r\nthis important performance the first period of its history reaches a\r\ndistinctly marked conclusion.\r\n\r\nThis time of vigorous advance was followed by many years, in which\r\nno notable work was done and no great discovery effected; there was\r\nactive disputation on what had been already ascertained, but it did not\r\nlead to any deeper conception of the questions or to new experimental\r\ndeterminations.\r\n\r\n2. About the year 1760 new life was infused into the consideration of\r\nvarious branches of vegetable physiology. Du Hamel’s ‘Physique des\r\narbres’ (1758) gave a summary of former knowledge and added a number of\r\nnew observations, and from that time till the beginning of the present\r\ncentury a series of important discoveries was made. The doctrine of\r\nsexual propagation, which had scarcely been advanced since the time of\r\nCamerarius, and was disfigured by the theory of evolution, found an\r\nobserver of the first rank in Koelreuter (1760-1770), who threw new\r\nlight upon the nature of sexuality by his experiments on the artificial\r\nproduction of hybrids; he was the first who carefully studied the\r\narrangements for pollination, and pointed out the remarkable connection\r\nbetween them and insect-life. These relations were afterwards (1793)\r\nexamined in greater detail by Konrad Sprengel, who arrived at such\r\nastonishing and far-reaching results, that they were not even\r\nunderstood by his contemporaries, nor was their significance fully\r\nappreciated till quite modern times and in connection with the theory\r\nof descent.\r\n\r\nNo less important was the advance made in the doctrine of the\r\nnourishment of plants. Between 1780 and 1790 Ingen Houss proved, that\r\nthe green parts of plants absorb carbon dioxide under the influence\r\nof light and eliminate the oxygen, and thus obtain the carbon which\r\nplants accumulate in organic combinations, but that all parts of\r\nplants also absorb at all times smaller quantities of oxygen, and\r\nexhale carbon dioxide, and so perform a process of respiration exactly\r\ncorresponding to that of animals. He was soon followed by Theodore\r\nde Saussure with more thorough investigation of these processes,\r\nand with proofs that the ash-constituents of a plant are no chance\r\nor unimportant addition to its food, as had been hitherto commonly\r\nsupposed (1804). The influence also of general physical forces on\r\nvegetation was established in some important points, though not yet\r\nsubmitted to searching examination. Thus Senebier showed in the period\r\nbetween 1780 and 1790 the great effect which light exercises on the\r\ngrowth and green colour of plants, and De Candolle at a later date\r\ndiscovered its operation in the case of leaves and flowers that show\r\nperiodic movements. Still more important was Knight’s discovery in 1806\r\nthat the upright growth of stems and the downward direction of the main\r\nroots are determined by gravitation.\r\n\r\n3. This second period of important discoveries was also followed by\r\na relapse, and again doubts were raised as to the correctness of the\r\nvery facts which had been best established; attempts were made under\r\nthe influence of preconceived opinions to invalidate or ignore these\r\nfacts, and to substitute for them theories that wore the guise of\r\nphilosophy. The so-called nature-philosophy, which had long been a\r\ngreat hindrance to morphology, proved in like manner injurious to\r\nvegetable physiology; the doctrine of the vital force especially stood\r\nin the way of every attempt to resolve the phenomena of life into their\r\nelementary processes, to discern them as a chain of causes and effects.\r\nThe ash-constituents of plants, and even their carbon, were traced to\r\nthis vital force, and misty notions connected with the word polarity\r\nwere used to explain the direction of growth and much beside. In like\r\nmanner the influence of the nature-philosophy was brought to bear on\r\nthe established results of the sexual theory to the destruction of all\r\nsound logic, and the sexuality of plants was once more openly impugned\r\nin the face of Koelreuter’s investigations. This state of things\r\ncontinued till some time after 1820, but then it began to improve once\r\nmore. L. C. Treviranus examined and refuted the errors of Schelwer and\r\nHenschel in 1822; in England Herbert conducted new and very valuable\r\ninvestigations into the question of hybridisation; and it was in this\r\nperiod that Carl Friedrich Gärtner studied and experimented on normal\r\nfertilisation and the production of hybrids during more than twenty\r\nyears; his conclusions, published in exhaustive works in 1844 and in\r\n1849, finally settled the more important questions connected with the\r\nsexual theory about the same time that Hofmeister established the\r\nmicroscopic embryology of Phanerogams on a firm foundation.\r\n\r\nOther parts also of vegetable physiology had been considerably advanced\r\nbefore 1840; Theodore de Saussure observed in 1822 the production of\r\nheat in flowers and its dependence on respiration; ten years later\r\nGoeppert proved the rise of temperature in germinating and vegetating\r\norgans. Dutrochet stimulated enquiry by his researches in various\r\nbranches of the science between 1820 and 1840; he was the first to\r\napply the phenomena of diosmosis to the explanation of the movement\r\nof sap in plants with a lasting influence on the further progress of\r\nphysiology. Chemical investigations were less fruitful in results,\r\nthough they served to collect a considerable material of single facts,\r\nwhich could afterwards be turned to theoretical account.\r\n\r\nThe close of this period, which began with unprofitable doubts, but\r\nin which much was set in a train for further development after 1840,\r\nis marked by the publication of some important compilations, in which\r\nall that had as yet been done in vegetable physiology was presented in\r\na connected form. In addition to Dutrochet’s collected works (1837)\r\nthree comprehensive compendia of vegetable physiology made their\r\nappearance, one by De Candolle, which was translated into German by\r\nRoeper and published with many improvements and additions in 1833\r\nand 1835; this was followed by a work on vegetable physiology by L.\r\nC. Treviranus, 1835-1838, and lastly by Meyen’s ‘Neues System der\r\nPflanzenphysiologie,’ 1837-1839. These works exhibit the characteristic\r\nfeatures of the period chiefly in this, that physiology finds as yet\r\nno strong support in phytotomy, while the old views of vital force are\r\nbrought face to face with more exact physico-chemical explanations of\r\nprocesses of vegetation.\r\n\r\n4. We have already pointed out the wonderful impulse given to the\r\nstudy of morphology and phytotomy, of embryology and cells about the\r\nyear 1840; it was shown also that this was due in a great measure\r\nto discarding the errors of the nature-philosophy and the idea of\r\nvital force, and requiring in the place of such speculations exact\r\nobservation and systematic induction, and how Schleiden’s ‘Grundzüge’\r\nsoon after 1840 vigorously met the demands of the newer time in\r\nthese respects, but without satisfying them by the positive results\r\nobtained. The rapid progress made by phytotomy and the doctrine of\r\ncells in the hands of von Mohl and Nägeli proved specially favourable\r\nto vegetable physiology, by making it possible to follow the processes\r\nof fertilisation in the interior of the ovule. The formation of the\r\npollen-tube from the pollen-grain had been observed long before\r\n1840, and Schleiden in 1837 had proposed the view that the embryo\r\nof Phanerogams was formed at the end of the pollen-tube by free\r\ncell-formation after it had entered the embryo-sac. But Amici in 1846\r\nand Hofmeister in 1849 showed that this notion was erroneous, and\r\nthat the germ-primordium is in existence in the embryo-sac before the\r\narrival of the pollen-tube and is excited by it to further development,\r\nto the forming the embryo. Similarly Hofmeister’s further observations\r\non the embryology of Vascular Cryptogams and Mosses left no doubt,\r\nthat the spermatozoids of these groups of plants discovered by Unger\r\nand Nägeli serve to fertilise the germ-cell or egg-cell previously\r\nformed in the female organ and to excite it to further development\r\n(1849, 1851). Soon after the sexual act was observed in various\r\nAlgae, and these afforded the best opportunity for solving by the\r\naid of the microscope the questions which experiment had still left\r\nopen. Thuret showed in 1854, how the large egg-cells in species of\r\nFucus are surrounded and fertilised by spermatozoids, and he even\r\nsucceeded in producing hybrids by fertilising the egg-cells of one\r\nspecies with the spermatozoids of another; but it was still uncertain\r\nwhether simple contact of the male and female organs was sufficient, or\r\nwhether fertilisation is due to the mingling of the substance of the\r\nspermatozoid and the germ-cell; the question was settled by Pringsheim\r\nin 1855; he saw the male organ of fertilisation of a fresh-water alga\r\npenetrate into the substance of the egg-cell and be dissolved in it,\r\nand this proceeding was afterwards observed in higher Cryptogams and is\r\nrepresented in its simplest form in the sexual act of the Conjugatae,\r\nwhich De Bary described at length in 1858 and like Vaucher regarded as\r\na sexual process.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider to what an extent the time and power of work of the\r\nmost eminent botanists was devoted after 1840 to long and difficult\r\nobservations on the minute anatomy of plants, on cell-formation,\r\nembryology and the history of the development of organs, we cannot\r\nwonder if other parts of vegetable physiology, which require\r\nexperiments on vegetation in plants, were cultivated but little and\r\nby the way only; but these studies also gained firmer footing in the\r\nadvance of phytotomy, which supplied the physiologist with a more\r\ndefinite idea of the organism in which the phenonema of vegetative life\r\nare produced.\r\n\r\nThe chemistry of the food of plants was one of the strictly\r\nphysiological subjects, which like the sexual theory was studied\r\nwithout intermission and with considerable success in the period from\r\n1840 to 1860, but chiefly or entirely by chemists, who connected\r\ntheir investigations into the processes of nutrition in plants with\r\nSaussure’s results. Agricultural chemists were chiefly engaged till\r\nnearly 1860 with the questions, whether all or certain constituents\r\nof the ash of a plant are indispensable parts of its food, and whence\r\nthese constituents are derived, and with cognate considerations on\r\nthe exhaustion of the soil by cultivation and its remedy by suitable\r\nmanuring. In France Boussingault had undertaken experimental and\r\nanalytical investigations on these subjects before 1840, and it was\r\nhe who in the course of the next twenty years made the most valuable\r\nphysiological discoveries; of these the most important was the fact\r\nthat plants do not make use of free atmospheric nitrogen as food, but\r\ntake up compounds of nitrogen for the purpose. In Germany the interest\r\nin such questions was increased by the instrumentality of Justus\r\nLiebig, who gathered from the knowledge that had been accumulated up\r\nto 1840 all that was fundamental and of real importance, and drew\r\nattention to the great practical value of the theory of the nutrition\r\nof plants in agriculture and in the management of woods and forests;\r\nconsiderable state provision was soon made for investigations of the\r\nkind, but these often wandered from the right path for the reason,\r\nthat being designed to promote practical interests they lost sight\r\nof the inner connection between all vital phenomena. Still a great\r\nmass of facts was accumulated, which careful sifting might afterwards\r\nrender serviceable to pure science. Some of the best agricultural\r\nchemists deserve the credit of vindicating purely scientific as well\r\nas practical points of view, and explained in comprehensive works the\r\ngeneral subject of the nutrition of plants, so far as it was possible\r\nto do so without going deeply into their organisation; among these\r\nwere Boussingault and the Germans Emil Wolff and Franz Schulze. But\r\nthe questions of the nutrition of plants, which are connected with the\r\nchemical processes of assimilation and metabolism within them, remained\r\nstill undecided, though some valuable preliminary work on these points\r\ndates from this time.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with this important advance in the sexual theory and the\r\ndoctrine of the nutrition of plants little was done in the branches\r\nof vegetable physiology which remain to be mentioned, and that little\r\nappeared in an unconnected and fragmentary state; different observers\r\nestablished the connection between the temperature of plants and\r\noxygen-respiration; some new single facts were discovered in connection\r\nwith the downward curvature of roots, Brücke published in 1848 an\r\nexcellent enquiry into the movements of Mimosa-leaves, and Hofmeister\r\nshowed in 1857 that the phenomenon, then known as bleeding in the\r\nvine and some other trees, takes place in all woody plants, and not\r\nin spring only but in every period of the year, if the requisite\r\nconditions are present. These and many other isolated observations were\r\nvery valuable for the future, but were not used at the time to frame\r\ncomprehensive theories, because no one devoted himself exclusively to\r\nquestions of the kind with the perseverance, which in these difficult\r\nsubjects can alone lead to certain results and to a deeper insight\r\ninto the inner connection of the phenomena. Surprisingly small was the\r\naddition to the knowledge of the movement of sap in plants, and still\r\nless was discovered respecting the external conditions of processes of\r\ngrowth and the movements connected with them. The important question of\r\nthe dependence of the phenomena of vegetation on temperature, was it\r\nis true not wholly neglected; but the mistake was made of attempting a\r\nshort cut by multiplying the total period of vegetation of a plant by\r\nthe mean daily temperature, in the hope of finding in this product an\r\nexpression for the total warmth required by a given plant; this mistake\r\nwas especially misleading in the geography of plants.\r\n\r\nThe more valuable knowledge which had been gathered up to 1851 was\r\nbrought together by von Mohl in his often-mentioned work on the\r\nvegetable cell with equal perspicuity and conciseness, and current\r\nviews were critically examined; vegetable physiology generally was\r\nexpounded at greater length but with less critical sifting in\r\nUnger’s text-book of 1855; these were the two books which did most to\r\ndisseminate a knowledge of the subject up to 1860, and they performed\r\ntheir task with credit; that which appears in Schacht’s books after\r\n1852 under the head of vegetable physiology rests on such imperfect\r\nacquaintance with this branch of science, as to diminish rather than\r\nincrease its reputation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPassing from this preliminary survey to a more detailed account of the\r\nsubject, it will be found necessary to keep the history of the sexual\r\ntheory distinct from other questions in vegetable physiology. This\r\nmode of proceeding is required by the fact, that the establishment and\r\nfurther elucidation of the decisive points in the sexual theory were\r\nmade independently of the rest of physiology, so that the historical\r\ncontinuity would be interrupted and the account rendered obscure by\r\nany attempt to connect the development of the theory chronologically\r\nwith other topics. In like manner the doctrine of the nutrition of\r\nplants and of the movement of the sap was developed uninterruptedly and\r\nin independence of other physiological matters; it will be advisable\r\ntherefore to devote a separate chapter to those subjects also. Earlier\r\ndiscoveries respecting the movements of the parts of plants and the\r\nmechanics of growth will be briefly recounted in a third chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                     HISTORY OF THE SEXUAL THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. FROM ARISTOTLE TO R. J. CAMERARIUS.\r\n\r\nIt will contribute to a correct appreciation of the discoveries made\r\ntowards the end of the 17th century by Rudolph Jacob Camerarius and his\r\nsuccessors in regard to the sexual relations of plants, if we first\r\nmake ourselves acquainted with all that was known of the matter up to\r\nthat time from Aristotle downwards; we shall learn at the same time\r\nhow extremely unfruitful was the superficial observation of the older\r\nphilosophy in a question in which inductive research only could lead to\r\nreal results.\r\n\r\nThat Aristotle[90] like many others after him reckoned sexual\r\nfertilisation among processes of nutrition, and thus failed to perceive\r\nthe specific and peculiar character of the latter, is shown distinctly\r\nby his assertion, that the nutritive and propagative power of the\r\nsoul is one and the same. This hasty generalisation was associated\r\nin Aristotle’s mind with another error arising from very defective\r\nexperience, which led him to bring sexuality in organisms into causal\r\nconnection with their movement in space. He tells us in his botanical\r\nfragments, that in all animals which have the power of locomotion, the\r\nfemale is distinct from the male, one creature being female, another\r\nmale, but both being of the same species, as in humankind. In plants\r\non the contrary these powers are combined and the male is not distinct\r\nfrom the female; each plant therefore reproduces itself and emits\r\nno fertilising material; and he adds, that in animals which do not\r\nmove, as those that have shells and those that live attached to some\r\nother substance, male and female are not distinguished, for their\r\nlife resembles that of plants; at the same time they are called male\r\nand female by resemblance and analogy, and there is a certain slight\r\ndistinction. In like manner some trees produce fruits while others do\r\nnot, though they aid fruit-bearing trees in the production of fruit, as\r\nhappens in the case of the fig-tree and the caprifig.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with these views of Aristotle those of his disciple\r\nTheophrastus[91] appear to some extent enlightened, and to rest on a\r\nwider experience, but even his observation supplies nothing of interest\r\non the subject; for he says that some blossoms of the ‘mali medicae’\r\nproduce fruit, and that some do not, and that it should be observed\r\nwhether the same thing occurs in other plants, which he might easily\r\nhave done for himself in his own garden. He is more concerned with\r\nputting his knowledge into logical order, than with answering the\r\nquestion whether there is any sexual relation in plants. It is certain,\r\nhe says, that among plants of the same species some produce flowers and\r\nsome do not; male palms, for instance, bear flowers, the female only\r\nfruit[92]; and he concludes the sentence by the remark, that in this\r\nlies the difference between these plants, and those which produce no\r\nfruit, and that it is obvious that there must be a great difference\r\nin the flowers. In his third book ‘De Causis’ (c. 15, 3) he says,\r\nthat terebinths are some male and some female, and that the former are\r\nbarren and are therefore called male. That Theophrastus in all these\r\nmatters trusted to the relations of others is shown by a passage in\r\nthe same book (c. 18, 1), where he says, ‘What men say, that the fruit\r\nof the female date-palm does not perfect itself unless the blossom\r\nof the male with its dust is shaken over it, is indeed wonderful,\r\nbut resembles the caprification of the fig, and it might almost be\r\nconcluded that the female plant is not by itself sufficient for the\r\nperfecting of the fœtus; but this cannot be the case in one genus or\r\ntwo, but either in all or in many.’ We observe the grand style in which\r\nthe Greek philosopher dismisses this important question, and how far he\r\nis from condescending to make an observation for himself.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in Pliny’s time the hypothesis of a sexual difference\r\nin plants had grown up and become confirmed in the minds if not of\r\nwriters, yet of those who occupied themselves with nature; Pliny in his\r\n‘Historia Mundi,’ describing the relation between the male and female\r\ndate-palm, calls the pollen-dust the material of fertilisation, and\r\nsays that naturalists tell us that all trees and even herbs have the\r\ntwo sexes[93].\r\n\r\nIf this theme supplied little material for reflection to philosophers,\r\nit did not fail to excite the fancy of the poets. De Candolle cites\r\nthe verses of Ovid and Claudian on the subject, and passing over\r\nthe intervening centuries for a very sufficient reason notices the\r\nlively poetic description of two date-palms in Brindisi and Otranto\r\nby Jovianus Pontanus in 1505. But nothing was gained in this way for\r\nnatural science.\r\n\r\nTreviranus in his ‘Physiologie der Gewächse[93]’ (1838), II. p. 371,\r\nhas well described the state of knowledge on this subject among the\r\nbotanists of Germany and the Netherlands in the 16th century. ‘The\r\nidea of a male sex in such plants as Abrotanum, Asphodelus, Filix,\r\nPolygonum mas et femina, was founded only on difference of habit, and\r\nnot on the parts which are essential to it. But it should be observed\r\nthat it is the less learned among the older botanists, Fuchs, Mattioli,\r\nTabernaemontan, who make most frequent use of this mode of designating\r\nplants; the more learned, as Conrad Gesner, de l’Écluse, J. Bauhin\r\nemploy it only in the case of a plant already known. De l’Écluse it\r\nis true in describing the plants which he found often notes the form,\r\ncolour, and even the number of the stamens; in Carica Papaya he calls\r\nthe individual with stamens the male, and the one with carpels the\r\nfemale, since he holds them to belong to different sexes, though of the\r\nsame species; but he is satisfied with saying, that it is affirmed that\r\nthe two are so far connected, that the female produces no fruit if the\r\nmale is separated from it by any great distance (‘Curae posteriores,’\r\n42).\r\n\r\nThe case of the botanists above-mentioned is simply one of ignorance;\r\nin the botanical philosopher Cesalpino on the contrary we see a\r\nconsequence of the Aristotelian system, which leads him distinctly to\r\nreject the hypothesis of separate sexual organs in plants as opposed to\r\ntheir nature. It is difficult to understand how De Candolle, at page 48\r\nof his ‘Physiologie végétale,’ can say that Cesalpino recognised the\r\npresence of sexes in plants. His conception of vegetable seed-grains\r\nas analogous to the male seed in animals must have made it impossible\r\nfor him to understand sexuality in plants. So too his notion that the\r\nseed is derived from the pith as the principle of life in plants,\r\nin connection with which he says at page 11 of the first of his\r\nsixteen books; ‘Non fuit autem necesse in plantis genituram aliquam\r\ndistinctam a materia secerni, ut in animalibus, quae mari et femina\r\ndistinguuntur.’ He regarded the parts of the flower which surround the\r\novary, or are separate from it, together with the stamens as simply\r\nenvelopes of the foetus; and though he knew, as has been already shown,\r\nthat in some plants, the hazel, chestnut, Ricinus, Taxus, Mercurialis,\r\nUrtica, Cannabis, Mais, the flowers are separate from the fruit, and\r\neven mentions that the barren individuals are called male, and the\r\nfruit-bearing female, he understood this only as a popular expression,\r\nwithout really admitting a sexual relation. Respecting the words male\r\nand female he says at page 15: ‘Quod ideo fieri videtur quia feminae\r\nmateria temperatior sit, maris autem calidior; quod enim in fructum\r\ntransire debuisset, ob superfluam caliditatem evanuit in flores,\r\nin eo tamen genere feminas melius provenire et fecundiores fieri\r\naiunt, si juxta mares serantur, ut in palma est animadversum, quasi\r\nhalitus quidam ex mari efflans debilem feminae calorem expleat ad\r\nfructificandum.’\r\n\r\nThere is no mention of the pollen here, still less any attempt to\r\nextend what had been observed in dioecious plants to the ordinary\r\ncases, in which flowers and pistil, as Cesalpino would say, are united\r\nin the same individual. His view of the relation between the seed and\r\nthe shoot, cited above on page 47, shows that he conceived of the\r\nformation of seeds as only a nobler form of propagation than that by\r\nbuds, but not essentially distinct from it. The idea of sexuality in\r\nplants was not in fact consonant with Cesalpino’s interpretation of\r\nAristotelian teaching.\r\n\r\nProsper Alpino’s account (1592) of the pollination of the date-palm\r\ncontains nothing new, except that he had seen it in Egypt himself[94].\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian botanist Adam Zaluziansky[95] made no observations of his\r\nown, but attempted in 1592 to reduce the traditional knowledge on the\r\nsubject to some kind of theory. The foetus, he says, is a part of the\r\nnature of plants, which they produce out of themselves, and is thus\r\ndistinguished from the shoot which grows from the plant, as a part\r\nfrom the whole, but the other as a whole from a whole. He quotes Pliny\r\nalmost word for word where he says, that observers of nature maintain\r\nthat all plants are of both sexes, but in some the sexes are conjoined,\r\nin others they are separate; in many plants the male and female are\r\nunited, and these have the power of propagation in themselves, like\r\nmany androgynous animals; and he explains this, more explicitly than\r\nAristotle, from defect of locomotion in plants. This is the case, he\r\nsays, with the majority of plants. In some, as the palm, the male\r\nand female are separated, and the female without the male produces\r\nno fruit, and where the dust from the male does not reach the female\r\nplant by natural means, man can assist. Zaluziansky like other writers\r\nis anxious that plants of different sexes should not be taken for\r\ndifferent species. He refers also to the popular distinction of many\r\nplants into male and female according to certain external peculiarities.\r\n\r\nJung again must certainly have known the facts and views that were\r\ncurrent in his time; but there is nothing in his botanical writings to\r\nshow that he entertained the idea of a real sexuality in plants, of the\r\nnecessity of the co-operation of two sexes in the work of propagation.\r\nIt might almost be believed that the most learned and serious men, such\r\nas Cesalpino and Jung, were just those, who regarded the hypothesis of\r\nsexuality in plants as an absurdity, and shrunk from its consideration.\r\nThis impression is conveyed too by Malpighi’s ‘Anatomie des Plantes.’\r\nIt was Malpighi who gave the first careful account of the development\r\nof the seed, and studied the earlier stages in the growth of the embryo\r\nin the embryo-sac; and yet even he says nothing of the co-operation\r\nof the dust contained in the anthers in the formation of the embryo,\r\nand does not once mention the views of former writers. Malpighi,\r\nlike Cesalpino, regarded the formation of seeds as only another kind\r\nof ordinary bud-formation, and propagation as only another kind of\r\nnutrition. He mentions (p. 52) incidentally that plants with unfruitful\r\nflowers are designated as male, but treats this as a popular expression\r\nmerely, and ultimately propounds the theory that the stamens and the\r\nfloral envelopes remove a portion of the sap from the flower, in order\r\nto purify the sap for the production of the seeds (p. 56).\r\n\r\nIn all accounts of the theory of sexuality in plants, a botanist\r\notherwise unknown in history, Sir Thomas Millington, is named as the\r\nperson who first claimed for the stamens the character of male organs\r\nof generation. The only record of the fact, however, is contained in\r\nthe following words of Grew in his ‘Anatomy of Plants’ (1682), ch. 5,\r\nsect. 3, p. 171: ‘In conversation on this matter (namely the connection\r\nof the stamens, called by Grew the attire[96], with the formation of\r\nseeds) with our learned Savilian Professor Sir Thomas Millington, he\r\ntold me he was of opinion that the attire served as the male organ in\r\nthe production of the seed. I replied at once, that I was of the same\r\nopinion, and gave him some reasons for it, answering at the same time\r\nsome objections that might be brought against it.’ Grew gives on p.\r\n172 the following summary of his ideas on the subject[97]; it would\r\nappear, he says, that the attire serves to remove some superfluous\r\nparts of the sap, as a preparatory process to the production of seed.\r\nAs the floral envelopes (foliature) serve to remove the volatile and\r\nsaline sulphur-parts, so the attire serves to lessen and adjust the\r\ngaseous, in order that the seed may become more oily and its principles\r\nbe better fixed. Here we find ourselves on the ground of the chemistry\r\nof the day, in which sulphur, salt, and oil play the chief parts.\r\nConsequently, continues Grew, the flower has usually a stronger smell\r\nthan the attire, because the saline sulphur is stronger than the\r\ngaseous, which is too subtle to affect the sense. Closely adhering to\r\nMalpighi’s view he goes on to compare these processes in the flower\r\nwith processes in the ovary of animals, inasmuch as they qualify\r\nthe sap in the ovary for the approaching formation of seed, and he\r\nsays that as the young and early attire before it opens contains the\r\nsuperfluous part of the female organ, so after it is opened it probably\r\nperforms the office of the male. But how confused his ideas still were\r\non this point may be further seen by examination of the passage which\r\nfollows in his book (page 172, section 7), where, speaking of the\r\nsingle flowers in the head of the Compositae, he regards the blade,\r\nthat is the style and stigma, of the floral attire as a portion of a\r\nmale organ, and the globulets (pollen-grains) and other small particles\r\nupon the blade and in the thecae (anthers) of the seed-like attire as\r\na vegetable sperm, which subsequently when the parts are duly matured\r\nfalls down upon the seed-case and so touches it with a prolific virtue.\r\n\r\nHe meets the objection, that the same plant must consequently be both\r\nmale and female, with the fact, that snails and other animals are\r\nsimilarly constituted. That the pollen-grains communicate a prolific\r\nvirtue to the ovary (uterus) or to its juices by simply falling upon\r\nit, he thinks is rendered probable by comparing this with the process\r\nof fertilisation in many animals, and here Grew has some curious\r\nremarks. The section closes with the observation that to expect\r\ncomplete similarity in this matter between plants and animals, is to\r\nrequire that the plant should not only resemble an animal, but should\r\nactually be one.\r\n\r\nIf now we ask ourselves, what it really was that was gained from\r\nMillington and Grew, we find that it was simply the conjecture, that\r\nthe anthers produce the male element in fertilisation, and that this\r\nview was closely connected in their minds with the strangest chemical\r\ntheories and analogies from animal life. It is remarkable by what\r\nindirect ways science sometimes advances. If Grew had only been\r\nprepared to assume some kind of sexuality in plants, he need only have\r\ntaken up Theophrastus’ statement, that the anther-dust of the male\r\npalm is shaken over the female to produce fertilisation; and since\r\nboth Grew and Malpighi observed the pollen in the anthers, they might\r\nat once and in reliance on this experiment of a thousand years before\r\nhave come to the conclusion that the stamens are the male organs. But\r\nGrew never mentions the ancient views and experiences. Like other\r\nwriters before Camerarius, he made no attempt to answer the question\r\nby experiment. It was a step in advance, when Ray in his ‘Historia\r\nPlantarum’ (1693), I. cap. 10, p. 17; II. p. 1250, threw some light on\r\nthe very obscure train of thought in Grew’s mind, and did something to\r\nput it on the right track, by referring to the case of dioecious plants\r\nand to the old experience of the date-palm, but he too made no attempt\r\nto settle the question by experiment. The true discoverer of sexuality\r\nin plants, Camerarius, was however engaged in the experimental solution\r\nof the problem two years before the appearance of Ray’s ‘Historia\r\nPlantarum.’ Ray’s remarks on the subject in the preface to his ‘Sylloge\r\nStirpium’ (1694) are only assertion founded on no experiments. But\r\nif any are prepared to attribute greater value to the utterances of\r\nGrew and Ray, the comparison of them with the way in which Camerarius\r\naddressed himself to the question will show at once, that it was he\r\nwho so far advanced the theory of the subject as to make it accessible\r\nto experimental treatment, as he undoubtedly was the first who not\r\nonly undertook experiments on the subject but carried them out with\r\nthe skill which will appear in the following section. Linnaeus was\r\nright when he says in his ‘Amoenitates’ (1749), I. p. 62, that it was\r\nCamerarius who first clearly demonstrated (perspicue demonstravit) the\r\nsexuality of plants and the mode of their propagation.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DOCTRINE OF SEXUALITY IN PLANTS BY RUDOLPH\r\nJACOB CAMERARIUS. 1691-1694.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that all that was known with regard to sexuality in\r\nplants up to 1691 was comprised in the facts related by Theophrastus\r\nconcerning the date-palm, the terebinth, and the ‘malus medica,’ and in\r\nthe conjectures of Millington, Grew, and Ray, while Malpighi’s views in\r\nopposition to these later authors were considered to be equally well\r\nfounded. The sexuality of plants could only be raised to the rank of\r\na scientific fact in one way, that namely of experiment; it had to be\r\nshown that no seed capable of germination could be formed without the\r\nco-operation of the pollen. All historic records concur in proving,\r\nthat Camerarius was the first who attempted to solve the question\r\nin this way, and that he followed up this attempt by many other\r\nexperiments. It is quite another question how the fertilising matter\r\nreaches the germ which is capable of being fertilised, and this could\r\nnot be entertained till experiment had established the fact, that the\r\npollen is absolutely indispensable to fertilisation.\r\n\r\nTo Johann Christian Mikan, Professor of Botany in Prague, is due\r\nthe merit of having collected the scattered and therefore almost\r\nforgotten writings of RUDOLPH JACOB CAMERARIUS[98], and published\r\nthem, together with some similar works of Koelreuter, at Prague in 1797\r\nunder the title, ‘R. J. Camerarii Opuscula Botanici Argumenti.’ This\r\nbook, apparently little known, will be my principal authority for the\r\nfollowing remarks. The short preliminary communications are printed\r\nwithout alteration from the ninth and tenth year of the second, and\r\nfrom the fifth and sixth year of the third decury of the Ephemerides\r\nof the Leopoldina; the letter to Valentin, which will be noticed again\r\nfurther on, together with an abstract of the same and an answer of\r\nValentin, are given according to Gmelin’s edition of 1749.\r\n\r\nCamerarius had observed, that a female mulberry-tree once bore fruit,\r\nthough no male tree (amentaceis floribus) was in its neighbourhood,\r\nbut that the berries contained only abortive and empty seeds, which he\r\ncompared to the addled eggs of a bird. His attention was roused, and\r\nhe made his first experiment on another dioecious plant, Mercurialis\r\nannua; he took in the end of May two female specimens of the wild plant\r\n(they were usually called male, but he knew them to be the female) and\r\nset them in pots apart from others. The plants throve, the fruit was\r\nabundant and filled out, but when half ripe they began to dry up, and\r\nnot one produced perfect seeds; his communication on this subject is\r\ndated December 28, 1691. In the third decury of the Ephemerides, year\r\n5, he relates that in a sowing of spinach he had found monoecious as\r\nwell as dioecious plants, as Ray had observed in Urtica romana, and he\r\nhimself again in three other species. The disregard of this fact was\r\nafterwards the cause of erroneous interpretation of the experiments and\r\nof doubt about sexuality.\r\n\r\nBut Camerarius’ chief composition on the subject of sexuality in\r\nplants is his letter ‘De sexu Plantarum,’ which is often mentioned but\r\napparently little read, and which he addressed to Valentin, Professor\r\nin Giessen, on Aug. 25, 1694. It is the most elaborate treatise on the\r\nsubject which had as yet been written, or indeed which appeared before\r\nthe middle of the 18th century, and contains more profound observations\r\nthan were made by any other botanist before Koelreuter. The style\r\ncontrasts favourably with the style of the writers of the time, and\r\nis thoroughly that of modern natural science; it combines perfect\r\nknowledge with careful criticism of the literature of the subject;\r\nthe construction of the flower is explained more clearly than it had\r\never been before, or was again for a long time after, and expressly\r\nfor the purpose of making the meaning of his experiments on sexuality\r\nintelligible. The whole tone of the letter shows that Camerarius was\r\ndeeply impressed with the extraordinary importance of the question, and\r\nthat he was concerned to establish the existence of sexuality by every\r\npossible means.\r\n\r\nAfter detailed examination of the parts of the flower, the anthers and\r\npollen, the behaviour of the ovules before and after fertilisation,\r\nthe phenomena of double flowers and similar matters, from all which he\r\ncautiously deduces the meaning of the anthers (apices), he proceeds\r\nto bring forward direct proofs. He says, ‘In the second division of\r\nplants, in which the male flowers are separated from the female on the\r\nsame plant, I have learnt by two examples the bad effect produced by\r\nremoving the anthers. When I removed the male flowers (globulos) of\r\nRicinus before the anthers had expanded, and prevented the growth of\r\nthe younger ones but preserved the ovaries that were already formed,\r\nI never obtained perfect seeds, but observed empty vessels, which\r\nfell finally to the ground exhausted and dried up. In like manner I\r\ncarefully cut off the stigmas of Mais that were already dependent, in\r\nconsequence of which the two ears remained entirely without seeds,\r\nthough the number of abortive husks (vesicularum) was very great.’\r\nHe then refers to his former communications to the Ephemerides on\r\ndioecious plants, and says that the case of the spinach confirmed these\r\nresults. After alluding to similar relations in animals he continues,\r\n‘In the vegetable kingdom no production of seeds, the most perfect\r\ngift of nature, the general means for the maintenance of the species,\r\ntakes place, unless the anthers have prepared beforehand the young\r\nplant contained in the seed (nisi praecedanei florum apices prius ipsam\r\nplantam debite praeparaverint). It appears, therefore, justifiable to\r\ngive these apices a nobler name and to ascribe to them the significance\r\nof male sexual organs, since they are the receptacles in which the\r\nseed itself, that is that powder which is the most subtle part of the\r\nplant, is secreted and collected, to be afterwards supplied from them.\r\nIt is equally evident, that the ovary with its style (seminale vasculum\r\ncum sua plumula sive stilo) represents the female sexual organ in the\r\nplant.’ Further on he assents to Aristotle’s theory of the mixture of\r\nsexes in plants, and adduces Swammerdam’s discovery of hermaphroditism\r\nin snails, which he says is the exception in animals but the rule in\r\nplants. One erroneous notion which was only seen to be erroneous a\r\nhundred years later by Konrad Sprengel, and not finally refuted till\r\nwithin the last few years, was his belief that hermaphrodite flowers\r\nfertilise themselves, and this by comparison with the snails he thinks\r\nis strange, though most botanists till down to our own times, in spite\r\nof Koelreuter and Sprengel, did not find it strange. That sexuality\r\nin plants was admitted by botanists, Ray excepted, at the close of\r\nthe 17th century at most in a figurative sense, but that Camerarius\r\nconceived of it as in the animal kingdom, and sought to make this\r\nconception prevail, is apparent from the strong expressions, which he\r\nuses to show that in dioecious plants the distinction between male and\r\nfemale plants is not to be understood figuratively. He says that the\r\nnew foetus, the young plant contained in the seed, is formed inside\r\nthe coat of the seed after the plant has flowered, exactly as the new\r\nfoetus is formed in animals. The authority of the ancients was still\r\ngreat at that time, for Camerarius thinks it necessary to insist that\r\nthe views of Aristotle, Empedocles, and Theophrastus are not opposed\r\nto his sexual theory. Camerarius appears as the true investigator\r\nof nature, endowed with the true discerning spirit in disregarding\r\nthe question which had already been raised with respect to animals,\r\nwhether the ovum or the spermatozoid (vermis) produces the foetus,\r\nbecause the first thing to be done was to establish the fact of a\r\nsexual difference, not the mode of generation; he thinks it certainly\r\ndesirable to examine and see what the pollen-grains contain, how far\r\nthey penetrate into the female parts, whether they advance uninjured\r\nas far as the seed which receives them, or what they discharge if they\r\nburst before reaching it. He does full justice to Grew’s services in\r\nconnection with the knowledge of the pollen and its function.\r\n\r\nIt does all honour to the scientific spirit in Camerarius, that he\r\nraises a number of objections to his own theory; one was, that Lycopods\r\nand Equisetaceae produce, as he thinks, no young plants from their\r\npollen; he suspected therefore that they have no seed. It should be\r\nremembered that the germination of Equisetaceae and Lycopods was not\r\nobserved till the 19th century. An objection, more important at the\r\ntime, was that a third ear of a castrated maize plant contained eleven\r\nfertile seeds, of whose origin he could give no account. He was even\r\nmore disturbed by finding that three plants of hemp taken from the\r\nfield and cultivated in the garden produced fertile seeds, and he tries\r\nto explain it by supposing various ways in which pollination might have\r\ntaken place unobserved. This led him to make a fresh experiment; next\r\nyear he placed a pot containing seedlings of hemp in a closed room;\r\nthree male and three female plants grew up; the three male were cut off\r\n(not by himself) before their flowers opened; the female produced a\r\ngreat number of abortive seeds, but also a good many fruitful ones. His\r\nopponents and those who sought to appropriate his honours fastened,\r\nas is usual, on these failures, without being able to account for the\r\nexperiments which had been successful. The statement of his failures is\r\nour best proof of the exactness of his observations, for we now know\r\nthe cause of failure, which Camerarius himself observed, but did not\r\napply in explanation. We may assume that he would have cleared up this\r\npoint in his splendid investigations in a quieter time, for at the end\r\nof his letter he laments the unjust war then raging; it was the time\r\nof the predatory campaign of Louis XIV. To his letter is appended a\r\nLatin ode of twenty-six stanzas by an unknown poet, probably a pupil\r\nof his own; it is an epitome of the ‘Epistola de sexu Plantarum,’ as\r\nGoethe’s well-known poem contains the chief points of his doctrine\r\nof metamorphosis, but it resembles Goethe’s composition in no other\r\nrespect; it begins\r\n\r\n    Novi canamus regna cupidinis,\r\n    Novos amores, gaudia non prius\r\n      Audita plantarum, latentes\r\n      Igniculos, veneremque miram.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. DISSEMINATION OF THE NEW DOCTRINE; ITS ADHERENTS AND OPPONENTS.\r\n1700-1760.\r\n\r\nNo part of botany has so often engaged the pen of the historian, as the\r\ndoctrine of sexuality in plants; but the majority of writers have not\r\ngone to the original sources for their information, and the consequence\r\nhas been that the merits of the real founders and promoters of the\r\ndoctrine have often been thrown into the shade for the benefit of\r\nothers; even German botanists have ascribed the services of Camerarius\r\nto Frenchmen and Englishmen, because they were unacquainted with his\r\nwritings, or were unable to judge of the question and its solution.\r\nWe shall here endeavour to show from the records of the 18th century\r\nhow far anyone before Koelreuter really contributed anything of value\r\nto the establishment of the sexual theory. As is usually the case\r\nin great revolutions in science, some simply denied the new theory,\r\nmany adopted it without understanding the question, others formed a\r\nperverse and distorted conception of it under the influence of reigning\r\nprejudices, while others again sought to appropriate to themselves\r\nthe merit of the real discoverer; there were but few who with a right\r\nunderstanding of the question advanced it by new investigations.\r\n\r\nThe botanists who endeavoured to aid in determining the matter by their\r\nown observations may be distinguished into those, to whom the important\r\npoint was the enquiry whether the pollen is absolutely necessary to\r\nthe formation of seed, such as Bradley, Logan, Miller, and Gleditsch,\r\nand those who like Geoffroy and Morland assumed that sexuality was no\r\nlonger an open question, and who were bent on observing in what way\r\nthe pollen effects fertilisation in the ovule. But there was another\r\nclass of writers altogether, who, believing that they could deal with\r\nthe subject without making observations and experiments of their own,\r\neither like Leibnitz, Burckhard, and Vaillant, simply accepted the\r\nresults of the observations of others on general grounds, or like\r\nLinnaeus and his disciples, endeavoured to draw fresh proofs from\r\nphilosophical principles, or like Tournefort and Pontedera, simply\r\nrejected the idea of sexuality in plants. Lastly, we might mention\r\nPatrick Blair who did nothing himself, but merely appropriated the\r\ngeneral results of Camerarius’ observations, and has had his reward\r\nin being quoted even by German writers as one of the founders of the\r\nsexual theory[99].\r\n\r\nWe have now to see what was really brought to light by further\r\nexperiment and observation. BRADLEY appears to have been the first who\r\nexperimented on hermaphrodite flowers with a view to establish the\r\nsexuality of plants (‘New improvements in Gardening’ (1717), I. p.\r\n20). He planted twelve tulips by themselves in a secluded part of his\r\ngarden, and as soon as they began to flower removed the anthers; the\r\nresult was, that not one of them produced seeds, while four hundred\r\ntulips in another part of the same garden produced seeds in abundance.\r\n\r\nTwenty years pass by before another experiment is made. JAMES\r\nLOGAN[100], Governor of Pennsylvania, an Irishman by birth, set some\r\nplants of maize in each corner of a plot of ground, which was forty\r\nfeet broad, and about eighty long, and experimented on them in various\r\nways. In October he noted the following results:—the cobs of the\r\nplants, from which he had removed the male panicles when the stigmas\r\nwere already dependent, presented a good appearance; but closer\r\nexamination showed that they were unfertilised, with the exception of\r\none which was turned in the direction from which the wind might have\r\nconveyed pollen from other plants. On the cobs, from which he had\r\nremoved some of the stigmas, he found exactly as many grains as he had\r\nleft stigmas. One cob, which had been wrapped in muslin before the\r\nappearance of the stigmas, produced only empty husks.\r\n\r\nMiller’s experiments in 1751, which Koelreuter has extracted from the\r\n‘Gardener’s Dictionary,’ part II[101], are specially interesting,\r\nbecause the aid of insects in pollination was then observed for the\r\nfirst time. Miller planted twelve tulips, six or seven ells apart, and\r\ncarefully removed the stamens as soon as the flowers began to open;\r\nhe imagined that he should thus entirely prevent fertilisation; some\r\ndays after he saw some bees load themselves with pollen in an ordinary\r\ntulip-bed and fly over to his imperfect flowers. After they were gone,\r\nhe observed that they had left on the stigmas a quantity of pollen\r\nsufficient for fertilisation, and these tulips did in fact produce\r\nseed. Miller also kept some female plants of spinach apart from the\r\nmale, and found that they bore large seeds without embryos.\r\n\r\nProfessor GLEDITSCH, Director of the Botanic Garden in Berlin,\r\ndescribed in the same year (‘Histoire de l’Académie royale des sciences\r\net des lettres’ for the year 1749, published in 1751 at Berlin), an\r\nexperiment on the artificial fertilisation of Palma dactylifera folio\r\nflabelliformi, which was no doubt our Chamaerops humilis, since he says\r\nhimself in page 105 that it was Linnaeus’ Chamaerops, and Koelreuter\r\nspeaks of the plant in his report by that name. This treatise, in point\r\nof scientific tone and learned handling of the question, is the best\r\nthat appeared between the time of Camerarius and that of Koelreuter.\r\nWe learn from the introduction, that in the year 1749 there were few\r\nwho doubted the existence of sexuality in plants. The author says\r\nthat he has endeavoured to attain to perfect conviction on the point\r\nby many years’ experiments with plants of the most various kinds. Of\r\nlate years he had chiefly selected dioecious plants for investigation,\r\nCeratonia, Terebinthus, Lentiscus, and the species of date-palm\r\nwhich is commonly called Chamaerops. After relating the formation of\r\nfertile seeds in Terebinth and the mastic-tree produced by artificial\r\npollination, he turns to Chamaerops, of which species Prince Eugene\r\nhad repeatedly caused specimens of considerable size to be brought\r\nover from Africa; a specimen cost as much as a hundred pistoles; but\r\nthey died without flowering. ‘Our palm in Berlin,’ he continues, ‘is\r\na female, and may be eighty years old; the gardener asserts that it\r\nhas never borne fruit, and I have myself never seen fertile seeds on\r\nit during fifteen years.’ As there was no male tree of the kind in\r\nBerlin, Gleditsch procured some pollen from the garden of Caspar Bose\r\nin Leipsic. In the course of the nine-days’ journey the greater part\r\nof the pollen escaped from the anthers, and Gleditsch feared that it\r\nwas spoilt; but he was reassured by the Leipsic botanist Ludwig, who\r\nhad had experience in Algiers and Tunis, and who informed him that the\r\nAfricans usually employ dry pollen that has been kept for some time for\r\nthe purpose of fertilisation. Though the flowering of the female tree\r\nwas nearly over, he strewed the loose pollen on its flowers, and tied\r\nthe withered inflorescence of the male plant to a late-blowing shoot of\r\nthe female. The result was that fruit ripened in the following winter,\r\nand germinated in the spring of 1750. A second attempt conducted in a\r\nsimilar manner produced an equally favourable result[102].\r\n\r\nKoelreuter, who repeats this account in his ‘Historie der Versuche,’\r\na record of the experiments made between the years 1691 and 1752 on\r\nthe sexes of plants, ends his narrative with these words: ‘These\r\nare, as far as I know, all the attempts which have been made and\r\ndescribed since the year 1691 to prove the existence of sexes in\r\nplants.’ Koelreuter’s book was written to show that experiment only can\r\ndetermine the question of sexuality in the vegetable kingdom, and that\r\nno one beside Camerarius, Bradley, Logan, Miller, and Gleditsch had\r\npursued this method up to 1752.\r\n\r\nWhile these botanists occupied themselves with the question whether\r\nthere was a distinction of sexes in the vegetable kingdom, we meet with\r\ntwo writers at the beginning of the 18th century who regard sexuality\r\nas proved, and who take up the question of the mode in which the\r\npollen brings about the formation of the embryo. Both were adherents\r\nof the theory of evolution, bad observers, and not familiar with\r\nthe literature of the subject. The first is SAMUEL MORLAND. In the\r\n‘Philosophical Transactions’ of 1702 and 1703, p. 1474, he names Grew\r\nas the man who had observed that the pollen answers to the male semen,\r\nbut he makes no allusion to Camerarius’ experiments, the only ones\r\nwhich had as yet been made. He himself suggests that the young seeds\r\nmay be compared to unfertilised ova, while the pollen-dust (farina)\r\ncontains embryo plants, one of which must find its way into every\r\novule (ovum) in order to fertilise it. If so, the style must be a tube\r\nthrough which the embryos pass into the ova. He supposes the pollen in\r\nFritillaria imperialis to be washed by wind and rain from the stigma\r\nthrough the style into the ovary, without reflecting that the movement\r\nmust be an upward one in the hanging flower. If I could prove, he says,\r\nthat embryos are never found in unfertilised seeds, this would be a\r\ndemonstration; but I have never been so fortunate as to settle this\r\npoint. He does not mention that Camerarius had shown this ten years\r\nbefore; he can only give as the main argument for his conjecture,\r\nthat in beans the embryo lies near the orifice of the seed-coat (the\r\nmicropyle), which shows that he was not aware that the two large\r\nbodies in the seed of the bean (the cotyledons) belong to the embryo,\r\na fact which his countrymen Grew and Ray had already pointed out. It\r\nappears therefore, that Morland supplied no answer to the question how\r\nfertilisation takes place; his treatise contains nothing more than the\r\nassertion that the embryo is already contained in the pollen-grain, and\r\nthat it reaches the seed through a hollow style and is there developed,\r\nan entirely erroneous and not even an original idea, for it was the\r\noffspring of the theory of evolution which was at that time in vogue.\r\n\r\nGEOFFROY’S communications (‘Histoire de l’Académie royale des\r\nsciences,’ Paris, 1714, p. 210) contain a few more facts. He mentions\r\nneither Grew, Camerarius, nor even Morland, but connects his own\r\nobservations of 1711 on the structure and purpose of the more important\r\nparts of the flower with those of Tournefort, who was a decided\r\nopponent of the doctrine of sexuality in plants. The parts of the\r\nflower are hastily described, figures are given of some forms of\r\npollen-grains, and the notion that the style is a tube receives some\r\napparent confirmation from the experiment of drawing water through\r\nthe style of a lily. The view that the pollen is not an excrement, as\r\nTournefort and Malpighi had maintained, is defended partly by arguments\r\nwhich prove nothing, for instance, by the erroneous assertion that\r\nthe anthers are always so disposed that the extremity of the pistil\r\nmust necessarily receive their dust. The only proof offered for the\r\nfact that seeds are infertile if deprived of the co-operation of the\r\npollen, is a very hasty account of some experiments with maize and\r\nMercurialis. The result of these experiments, as well as some other\r\nremarks of Geoffroy, remind us of the text of Camerarius’ letter to an\r\nextent which mere accident will hardly account for. If Geoffroy really\r\nmade these experiments, which is open to some doubt, yet they were\r\nmade fifteen years later than those of Camerarius, who did make the\r\nsame experiments among others and has described them better. Geoffroy\r\nnext endeavours to show how the pollen effects the fertilisation,\r\nand offers two views on the subject; first, that the dust contains\r\nmuch sulphur and is decomposed on the pistil, the more subtle parts\r\nforcing their way into the ovary, where they set up a fermentation\r\nand cause the formation of the embryo; the second view is, that the\r\npollen-grains already contain the embryos, which find their way into\r\nthe seeds and are there hatched. This is Morland’s notion, who however\r\nis not mentioned. Geoffroy considers the latter to be the more probable\r\nhypothesis, chiefly because no embryo is found in the ovule before\r\nfertilisation, and also because the seed of the bean has an orifice\r\n(the micropyle); it does not occur to him that these facts speak as\r\nmuch for the first as for the second view.\r\n\r\nEnough has been produced to show that Morland and Geoffroy contributed\r\nnothing either to the establishment of the fact of sexuality in\r\nplants, or to the decision of the question how the pollen effects\r\nfertilisation in the ovule. Nevertheless I have mentioned these two\r\nmen immediately after those who really developed the sexual theory,\r\nbecause they at least took their stand on experience, and endeavoured,\r\nthough unsuccessfully, to demonstrate conditions of organisation\r\nwhich should explain the process of fertilisation. We come now to the\r\nnames of men—Leibnitz, Burckhard, Vaillant, Linnaeus—who are usually\r\nsupposed to have aided in establishing the sexual theory, but who\r\nmay be proved to have contributed nothing whatever to the scientific\r\ndemonstration of that doctrine. First as regards the philosopher\r\nLeibnitz; he says in a letter of 1701, from which Jessen has quoted\r\nthe most important parts in his ‘Botanik der Gegenwart und Vorzeit,’\r\n1864, p. 287: ‘Flowers are closely connected with the propagation\r\nof plants, and to discover distinctions in the mode of propagation\r\n(principiis generationis) is very useful,’ etc.; again, ‘A new and\r\nextremely important point of comparison will be hereafter supplied\r\nby the new investigations into the double sex in plants,’ alluding,\r\naccording to Jessen, to those of Camerarius and Burckhard. We shall\r\nnot expect to find that Leibnitz made experiments himself, and the\r\nwords quoted merely indicate that he wished to see the parts of the\r\nflower employed for purposes of classification, because according to\r\nthe observations of others they are the instruments of propagation.\r\nThe remark applies in a still higher degree to Burckhard, who in his\r\nletter to Leibnitz of 1702, quoted above on p. 83, further developed\r\nthe idea intimated by Leibnitz, for he too accepted the sexuality of\r\nplants as an established and self-evident truth. The address with which\r\nSebastian Vaillant opened his lectures at the Royal Gardens in Paris in\r\n1717 has often been noticed by the historians of botany. De Candolle,\r\nwho assigns to him an important share in developing the sexual theory,\r\nsays[103], that in this address he propounded the sexuality of plants\r\nmost expressly and as an acknowledged fact, and that he described very\r\ngraphically the way in which the anthers fertilise the pistil, into\r\nwhich description little that was correct probably found its way, since\r\nit required Koelreuter, Sprengel, and the botanists of quite modern\r\ntimes to clear up this point. Vaillant therefore can only have the\r\ncredit of an eloquent description of what was then accepted. However,\r\nDe Candolle goes on to say what Vaillant’s discoveries were, and on\r\nthe following page we read that Linnaeus confirmed these discoveries\r\nin the year 1736 in his ‘Fundamenta Botanica,’ and made skilful use of\r\nthem in the year 1735 in laying the foundations of his sexual system.\r\nWe have already in the second chapter of the first book explained the\r\nconfusion of ideas which lies at the bottom of these and many similar\r\nstatements, and in the same chapter have sufficiently indicated\r\nour opinion respecting Linnaeus’ share in the establishment of the\r\ndoctrine of sexuality. It was the character of Linnaeus’ mind to\r\nattach slight value to the experimental proof of a fact, even when,\r\nlike that of sexuality, it could only be proved by experiment; from\r\nthe point of view of his scholastic philosophy it was more important\r\nwith him to deduce the existence of this fact, in what seemed to\r\nhim the philosophic way, from the idea of the plant or from reason,\r\nand in doing so to drag in a variety of analogies from the animal\r\nkingdom; hence he acknowledged the services rendered by Camerarius,\r\nbut troubled himself little about his experiments which alone could\r\ndecide the question, while he undertakes himself to prove the existence\r\nof sexes in plants on grounds of reason and the like in his peculiar\r\nfashion. How he did this in the ‘Fundamenta’ and in the ‘Philosophia\r\nBotanica’ has been already shown. Here we will briefly notice the\r\noften-quoted dissertation, ‘Sponsalia Plantarum,’ in the first volume\r\nof the ‘Amoenitates Academicae’ (1749). He first gives the views of\r\nMillington, Grew, Camerarius and others; then on p. 63 he accepts the\r\nstatement of Gustav Wahlboom, that he, Linnaeus, had devoted infinite\r\nlabour to this question in 1735 in the ‘Fundamenta Botanica,’ and had\r\nthere (§§ 132-150) proved the sexes of plants with so great certainty\r\nthat no one would hesitate to found on it a detailed classification\r\nof plants. Here then we have once more the construction of Linnaeus’\r\nso-called sexual system introduced into the question of sexuality,\r\nas if it had anything whatever to do with the establishing the\r\nexistence of sexes in plants, and as to the infinite labour (infinito\r\nlabore) which Linnaeus is supposed to have given to the question,\r\nthe paragraphs cited from the ‘Fundamenta’ contain the scholastic\r\nsubtleties quoted in Book I. chap. 2, but not one single really new\r\nproof. The arguments in the dissertation we are considering are of\r\nexactly the same kind, and it is itself only a lengthy paraphrase of\r\nLinnaeus’ propositions in the ‘Fundamenta Botanica,’ illustrated by\r\nexperiments made by others, and with the addition of a few unimportant\r\nobservations, some of which are misinterpreted. We read, for instance,\r\np. 101, ‘Nectar is found in almost all flowers, and Pontedera thinks\r\nthat it is absorbed by the seeds that they may be the longer preserved;\r\nit might seem that bees must be hurtful to flowers, since they\r\ncarry away the nectar and the pollen;’ but Linnaeus, differing from\r\nPontedera, remarks that ‘bees do more good than harm, because they\r\nscatter the pollen on the pistil, though it is not yet ascertained what\r\nis the importance of the nectar in the physiology of the flower.’ This\r\nfact of the assistance rendered by insects, which was soon afterwards\r\nbetter described by Miller, is not further examined in this place, for\r\nLinnaeus goes on to speak of gourds, that they do not perfect their\r\nfruit under glass, because the wind is prevented from effecting the\r\npollination.\r\n\r\nOne experiment only is mentioned, but not the person by whom it\r\nwas made. We read at p. 99 that in the year 1723 in the garden of\r\nStenbrohuld, the male flowers of a gourd in bloom were daily removed,\r\nand that no fruit was formed. Soon after allusion is made to the\r\nartifices used by gardeners to obtain hybrid varieties of tulips and\r\ncabbage, but the matter is treated rather as agreeable trifling. In the\r\nthird volume of the Amoenitates of the year 1764, in which Koelreuter’s\r\nfirst enquiries into hybridisation had been already published, we find\r\na dissertation on hybrids by Haartman, which was certainly written\r\nas early as 1751. In this treatise the necessary existence of hybrid\r\nforms is concluded from philosophic principles, as Linnaeus had deduced\r\nsexuality from similar principles; no experiments are made, but\r\ncertain forms are arbitrarily assumed to be hybrids; a Veronica spuria\r\ngathered in the garden at Upsala in 1750 is asserted to be the product\r\nof Veronica maritima as the mother and of Veronica officinalis as the\r\nfather, but the only reason for assigning the paternity to the latter\r\nplant is that it grew close by. We find also a Delphinium hybridum\r\nstated on similar grounds to be the offspring of Delphinium elatum\r\nfertilised by Aconitum napellus, and a Saponaria hybrida to have arisen\r\nfrom the pollination of Saponaria officinalis by a Gentiana; and we are\r\ntold among other things that Actaea spicata alba is the offspring of\r\nActaea spicata nigra fertilised by Rhus toxicodendron. It is obvious\r\nthat in all this there was no observation of decisive facts, but simple\r\nconclusions from arbitrary premises.\r\n\r\nWe conclude therefore that neither Linnaeus nor his disciples in the\r\ninterval that elapsed between the labours of Camerarius and Koelreuter\r\ncontributed a single new or valid proof to the establishment of the\r\nfact, that there is a sexual difference in plants and that hybrids are\r\nformed between different species; and if many later botanists talked\r\nof the great services rendered by Linnaeus to the sexual theory, and\r\neven regarded him as its most eminent founder, this arose partly from\r\nthe fact that they were unable to distinguish between his scholastic\r\ndeductions and scientific proof, and partly from that confusion of the\r\nidea of sexuality with a classification of plants founded on the sexual\r\norgans, to which we have before called attention. Such a confusion\r\nof ideas gave rise to the claims which Renzi asserted on behalf of\r\nPatrizi, but which Ernst Meyer, in his ‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ iv.\r\np. 420, has refuted on this very ground. Even in our own century De\r\nCandolle has been blamed by Johann Jacob Roemer for not giving Linnaeus\r\nthe credit of being the actual founder of the sexual theory.\r\n\r\nA few words in conclusion on those writers, who after Camerarius’\r\ninvestigations still denied sexuality in plants, because they knew\r\nnothing of what had been written on the subject or were incapable of\r\nappreciating scientific proof. Tournefort must first be mentioned\r\non account of the great authority which he enjoyed with botanists\r\nduring the first half of the 18th century. In his ‘Institutiones rei\r\nherbariae’ of the year 1700 (Book I. p. 69), with which we have already\r\nmade acquaintance, he treats of the physiological significance of the\r\nparts of the flower, apparently in entire ignorance of Camerarius’\r\nresearches, and at any rate with a leaning to Malpighi’s views. He\r\nmakes the petals take up nourishment from the flower-stalks, which\r\nthey further digest and supply to the growing fruit, while the\r\nunappropriated parts of the sap pass through the filaments into the\r\nanthers and collect in the loculaments, to be afterwards discharged as\r\nexcreta. Tournefort even doubted the necessity of the pollination of\r\nthe female date-palm. The truth is that he was not well acquainted with\r\nthe facts, and was led astray by his preconceptions. The same was the\r\ncase with the Italian botanist Pontedera; in his ‘Anthologia’ of 1720\r\nhe reproduces Malpighi’s unlucky notion, and at the same time makes the\r\novary absorb the nectar for the perfecting of the seed; he regarded\r\nthe male flower in dioecious plants as a useless appendage.\r\n\r\nValentin, to whom Camerarius addressed his famous letter ‘De sexu\r\nplantarum’ in 1694, did his correspondent a disservice in publishing a\r\nshort abstract of it, which contained some gross misapprehensions of\r\nthe facts[104]. Alston in 1756 relying on these incorrect statements\r\ndisputed the conclusions of Camerarius, and doubted the sexual\r\nimportance of the stamens on very insufficient grounds. More reasonable\r\ndoubts were suggested by a German botanist, Möller, who observed that\r\nfemale plants of spinach and hemp produced seeds even after the removal\r\nof the male plants, and appealed to the apparently asexual propagation\r\nof Cryptogams; these objections were answered by Kästner of Göttingen,\r\nwho pointed to the fact that dioecious plants, the willow for instance,\r\nsometimes bear hermaphrodite flowers. The botanists in question would\r\nnever have entertained these doubts, if they had read and understood\r\nthe writings of Camerarius, or had been acquainted with the literature\r\nof the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION AND EPIGENESIS.\r\n\r\nWe have already observed the influence of the theory of evolution on\r\nthe doctrine of the fertilisation of plants in the case of Morland\r\nand Geoffroy. We learn more about it in the work, already quoted,\r\nof the philosopher Christian Wolff, ‘Vernünftige Gedanken von den\r\nWirkungen der Natur,’ Magdeburg, 1723; it will be well to give his\r\nown words, for they will serve to show at the same time the amount of\r\nknowledge possessed by a cultivated and well-read man in the country\r\nof Camerarius and thirty years after the appearance of his treatise\r\non the sexuality of plants. In the second chapter of the fourth part,\r\nwhich treats of the life, death, and generation of plants, Wolff\r\nsays: ‘Ordinarily plants are produced from seeds, for the seed not\r\nonly contains the plant in embryo but also its first food.’ He says\r\nthat propagation by means of buds is equally natural, for each bud\r\ncontains a branch in little. ‘We find inside in the flower a number of\r\nstalks disposed in a circle, and something at the top of each, which\r\nis full of dust and lets the dust fall on the upper part of that which\r\nholds the seed; this organ is compared by some to the genitals of the\r\nanimal, and the dust to the male seed; they think also that the seed\r\nis made fruitful by the dust, and that therefore the embryo must be\r\nconveyed by the dust into the seed-case and there be formed into seeds.\r\nI have proposed to examine into the matter, but I have always let it\r\nescape me.’ ... ‘Since all that has been hitherto adduced is found\r\nalso in flowers which spring from bulbs, and it is also certain that\r\nthe leaves of bulbs have consequently embryos in them ... it is easy\r\nto see that the embryos must come from the leaves of the bulbs. And\r\nsince they could as easily be conveyed from there into the seed-grains\r\nwith the sap, as into the dust which is produced in the upper part of\r\nthe flower, I am inclined to think that this is the true account of\r\nthe matter and that it will be confirmed by experience. But now comes\r\nthe main question, whence come the embryos into the sap; since they\r\nhave not an external figure only but an internal structure also, it is\r\nnot plain how they can be formed either by the mere inner movement of\r\nthe sap, or by separation of certain parts.... And this is certainly\r\nmore credible, that the embryos already exist in little in the sap and\r\nthe plant, before they are brought by some change into the condition\r\nin which they are met with in the seed and in buds. But there is the\r\nfurther question where they were previously. They must either lie one\r\nin another in a minute form, as Malebranche especially maintains, or\r\nthey are brought from the air and the earth with the nourishing sap\r\ninto the plant, an idea which Honoratus Fabri advanced and Perrault and\r\nSturm developed after him. According to the first opinion the first\r\nseed-grain must have contained everything in itself, which has grown\r\nfrom it to this hour.’ But this demand goes beyond even Wolff’s powers\r\nof belief; for, says he, it is too great a tax on the imagination to\r\nconceive of this inclosing of germs one in another like box within box.\r\nIt is well known that such notions as these were very prevalent in\r\nthe 18th century, and that the spermatozoids of animals were thought\r\nto lend considerable support to them; even Albert Haller after 1760\r\nwas an adherent of the theory of evolution. However confused Wolff’s\r\ngeneral train of thought may be, we should notice his perception of\r\nthe fact, that the theory of evolution does away with the sexual\r\nsignificance of the anthers. We shall see by-and-bye, that Koelreuter\r\nwas able to form a very different idea of sexual propagation. His great\r\nimportance in the history of the sexual theory will be best learnt\r\nfrom a consideration of the speculative views of his predecessors\r\nand contemporaries. It will not be amiss therefore to disregard\r\nchronology for a while, and to notice here the views of the Baron von\r\nGleichen-Russworm, and the feeble arguments of Kaspar Friedrich Wolff\r\nagainst the theory of evolution. The first-named writer in his work\r\n‘Das Neueste aus dem Reich der Pflanzen,’ 1764, relying principally on\r\nmicroscopic observation of the contents of pollen-grains, supported the\r\nview that the granules in them answer to spermatozoids in animals, and\r\nthat they find their way into the ovule and are there developed into\r\nembryos. Yet Gleichen was at the same time a zealous supporter of the\r\nsexual theory, and endeavoured to meet well-known objections to it by\r\npointing to the occurrence of female flowers on male plants of spinach;\r\nhe also made some experiments on maize and hemp in the interests of\r\nthe theory. He did not perceive that hybrids supply convincing proof\r\nagainst the theory of evolution, but he rightly appealed to them as\r\naffording strong arguments in favour of sexuality. His real knowledge\r\nof hybrids is partly drawn from the statements of Linnaeus, with\r\nwhich we have already made acquaintance; he even describes a hybrid\r\nbetween a goat and a cow, and other similar ones, and he is angry\r\nwith Koelreuter for fixing such narrow limits to the occurrence of\r\nhybrids; thus the first person who produced hybrids systematically in\r\nthe vegetable kingdom must submit to be scolded for refusing to accept\r\nthe imaginary hybrids of his contemporaries. Gleichen’s book and the\r\nselection from his microscopic discoveries, which appeared in 1777,\r\nabound in good detached observations; he was the first who saw and\r\nfigured the pollen-tubes of Asclepias, without of course suspecting\r\ntheir real nature and importance.\r\n\r\nKaspar Friedrich Wolff is usually said to be the writer who refuted the\r\ntheory of evolution. It is certainly true that in his dissertation for\r\nhis doctor’s degree in 1759, the well-known ‘Theoria generationis,’\r\nhe appeared as the decided opponent of evolution; but the weight of\r\nhis arguments was not great, and the hybridisation in plants which was\r\ndiscovered at about the same time by Koelreuter supplied much more\r\nconvincing proof against every form of evolution. Wolff conceived of\r\nthe act of fertilisation as simply another form of nutrition. Relying\r\non the observation, which is only partly true, that starved plants are\r\nthe first to bloom, he regarded the formation of flowers generally as\r\nthe expression of feeble nutrition (vegetatio languescens). On the\r\nother hand the formation of fruit in the flower was due to the fact,\r\nthat the pistil found more perfect nourishment in the pollen. In this\r\nWolff was going back to an idea which had received some support from\r\nAristotle, and is the most barren that can be imagined, for it appears\r\nto be utterly incapable of giving any explanation of the phenomena\r\nconnected with sexuality, and especially of accounting for the results\r\nof hybridisation. Wolff may have rejected the theory of evolution on\r\nsuch grounds as these, but he failed to perceive what it is which is\r\nessential and peculiar in the sexual act.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE SEXUAL THEORY BY JOSEPH GOTTLIEB\r\nKOELREUTER, AND KONRAD SPRENGEL. 1761-1793.\r\n\r\nCamerarius had shown by experiment that the co-operation of the pollen\r\nis indispensable to the production in plants of seeds containing an\r\nembryo, and later observers had confirmed the fact of sexuality by\r\nfurther and varied experiments. The next step in the strict scientific\r\ninvestigation of the matter was to determine by the same method of\r\nexperiment the share of each principle, the male and the female, in the\r\nformation of the new plant which resulted from the sexual act. When\r\npollen and ovule belong to the same individual plant, the offspring\r\nassumes the same form and the question remains undecided. It was\r\nnecessary to bring together the pollen and ovule of different plants;\r\nthis must show whether some characters are derived to the offspring\r\nfrom the pollen, and others from the ovule, and what the characters are\r\nwhich are thus distinguished, supposing of course that such a union of\r\ndifferent forms is possible. The answer to these questions could only\r\nbe obtained by experiment, that is by artificial hybridisation; for\r\nuntil hybrid forms had actually been produced in this manner, it must\r\nbe quite unsafe to assume that certain wild plants owed their origin to\r\ncross-fertilisation.\r\n\r\nCamerarius had already raised the question in his letter, whether\r\ncross-fertilisation in plants is possible, and had added another,\r\nwhether the progeny varies from its parents (an et quam mutatus\r\ninde prodeat foetus). Bradley is our authority for the statement\r\nthat a gardener in London had obtained a hybrid between Dianthus\r\ncaryophyllus and Dianthus barbatus by artificial means as early as\r\n1719; but KOELREUTER[105] was the first who investigated the question\r\nscientifically and thoroughly. He was the first moreover who recognised\r\nall its importance, and he applied himself to it with such admirable\r\nand unexampled perseverance and judgment, that the results which he\r\nobtained are still the best and most instructive, though a thousand\r\nsimilar experiments have been made since his time. He also made the\r\nfirst careful study of the different arrangements inside the flower in\r\ntheir connection with the sexual relation, discovered the purpose of\r\nthe nectar and the co-operation of insects in pollination, and proposed\r\nthat view of the sexual act, which with some considerable modification\r\nwe must still in the main consider to be the true one, namely, that it\r\nis a mingling together of two different substances.\r\n\r\nIf we compare Koelreuter’s writings, which are full of matter in a\r\nsmall compass, with all that was produced after Camerarius, we are\r\nastonished not only at the abundance of new thoughts, but still more\r\nat their wonderful clearness and perspicuity, and the sureness of the\r\nfoundation laid for them in observation and experiment. In reading the\r\nobservations of Linnaeus, Gleichen, and Wolff on the sexual theory\r\nwe step into a world of thought which has long been strange and is\r\nscarcely intelligible to us, and which in the present day possesses\r\nonly a historical interest. Koelreuter’s works on the contrary seem\r\nto belong to our own time; they contain the best knowledge which we\r\npossess on the question of sexuality, and have not become antiquated\r\nafter the lapse of more than a hundred years. We see by his example\r\nthat one really gifted thinker with the requisite perseverance will\r\neffect more in a few years, than many less gifted observers in the\r\ncourse of many years. But the same thing happened now, which happens\r\noften in similar cases and which happened to Camerarius; a much longer\r\ntime elapsed before others learnt to understand the meaning and\r\nimportance of Koelreuter’s labours, than he had found necessary for\r\nmaking his discoveries.\r\n\r\nKoelreuter’s most important and best-known work appeared in four\r\nportions in 1761, 1763, 1764 and 1766 under the title, ‘Vorläufige\r\nNachricht von einigen das Geschlecht der Pflanzen betreffenden\r\nVersuchen und Beobachtungen’; we shall endeavour to give a brief\r\nsummary of the more important results.\r\n\r\nAt different places in this work occur remarks and experiments on\r\narrangements for pollination, which up to that time had been seldom and\r\nonly hastily observed. As the pollen-tube had not yet been discovered,\r\nand Koelreuter himself set out with the view, that a fluid finds its\r\nway from the pollen-grains as they lie on the stigma to the ovules, it\r\nwas important first of all to determine the quantity of pollen which is\r\nrequired for the complete fertilisation of an ovary; with this object\r\nin view Koelreuter counted the pollen-grains formed in a particular\r\nflower and compared them with the number required to be applied to\r\nthe stigma in order to effect complete fertilisation, and he found\r\nthat the latter number was much the smaller. For instance, he counted\r\nfour thousand eight hundred and sixty-three pollen-grains in a flower\r\nof Hibiscus venetianus, while from fifty to sixty were sufficient to\r\nproduce more than thirty fertile seeds in the ovary; in Mirabilis\r\njalapa and Mirabilis longiflora he counted about three hundred grains\r\nof pollen in the anthers, while from two to three or even one sufficed\r\nfor fertilisation in the one-ovuled ovary. He also tried, whether in\r\nflowers with divided and even deeply-cleft styles fertilisation could\r\nbe effected in all compartments of the ovary through one of them only,\r\nand he found that it could.\r\n\r\nKoelreuter directed special attention to the arrangements, by which in\r\nthe natural course of things the pollen finds its way from the anthers\r\nto the stigmas. He ascribed perhaps too much to the agency of the wind\r\nand the oscillations of the flower from any cause; at the same time he\r\nwas the first who recognised the great importance of the insect-world\r\nto pollination in flowers. ‘In flowers,’ he says, ‘in which pollination\r\nis not produced by immediate contact in the ordinary way, insects are\r\nas a rule the agents employed to effect it,’ (later observation has\r\nshown that they are generally so employed even in cases where actual\r\ncontact is possible), ‘and consequently to bring about fertilisation\r\nalso; and it is probable that they render this important service if\r\nnot to the majority of plants at least to a very large part of them,\r\nfor all the flowers of which we are speaking have something in them\r\nwhich is agreeable to insects, and it is not easy to find one such\r\nflower, which has not a number of these creatures busy about it.’ He\r\nnoticed the dichogamous construction in Epilobium, but did not further\r\npursue his observation. He next examined the substance in flowers which\r\nis agreeable to insects; he collected the nectar of many flowers in\r\nconsiderable quantities, and found that it gave after evaporation of\r\nthe water a kind of sweet-tasted honey; this honey was unpalatable only\r\nin Fritillaria imperialis, which is avoided by the humble-bees. He had\r\nno doubt therefore, that bees procure their honey from the nectar of\r\nflowers. How greatly he was interested in the relations between the\r\nexistence of certain plants and that of certain animals, relations\r\nwhich were neglected till Darwin once more brought them into notice in\r\nquite recent times, is shown by his investigation into the propagation\r\nof the mistletoe (1763); he calls special attention to the fact, that\r\nnot only must the pollination of this plant be effected by insects, but\r\nthat the dissemination of its seeds is also exclusively the work of\r\nbirds, and that the existence of the plant therefore is dependent on\r\ntwo different classes of living creatures.\r\n\r\nAgain we find observations on the movements of anthers and stigmas,\r\nespecially those caused by sensitiveness. Count Giambattista dal Covolo\r\nhad made the first observations in 1764 on the sensitiveness of the\r\nanthers of thistle-like plants, and had endeavoured to explain their\r\nmechanism. Koelreuter did not trouble himself about this point, so much\r\nas about the connection between the irritability of the anthers and the\r\npollination of the stigmas. He took into consideration the sensitive\r\nstamens of Opuntia, Berberis and Cistus, which Du Hamel had already\r\nnoticed, and discovered for himself the irritability of the lobes of\r\nthe stigma in Martynia proboscidea and Bignonia radicans. He noticed\r\nthat the lobes when touched close, but soon open again; but if pollen\r\nis placed upon them, they remain closed till fertilisation is secured.\r\n\r\nHow perfectly insects effect the pollination of flowers he showed by a\r\ncomparative trial, in which he applied pollen himself to three hundred\r\nand ten flowers with a brush, while he left the same number to the\r\noperation of insects; the number of seeds formed in the latter case was\r\nvery little less than in the former, though the insects had to contend\r\nwith unfavourable weather.\r\n\r\nHe endeavoured also to ascertain the time required for the quantity\r\nof ‘seminal matter’ sufficient for fertilisation to reach the ovary\r\nafter pollination; he also showed that pollination is followed by\r\nfertilisation without the aid of light; later botanists incorrectly\r\nmaintained the contrary.\r\n\r\nKoelreuter was less successful in his observations on the structure of\r\npollen-grains; here the microscope was indispensable and microscopes\r\nwere still very imperfect. Nevertheless he discovered that the\r\nouter covering of the pollen-grain consists of two distinct coats,\r\nand noticed the spines and sculpturings on the outer coat and its\r\nelasticity; he observed the lids of the orifices in the exine of\r\nPassiflora coerulea, and went so far as to see the inner coat in\r\nmoistened pollen-grains protrude in the form of conical projections,\r\nwhich then however burst and allowed the contents to escape. But he\r\nexplained the pollen-tube, which he had thus seen, incorrectly by\r\nsupposing that these projections were intended to prevent the bursting\r\nof moistened grains. It was not till sixty or seventy years later that\r\nthe matter was fully understood. Koelreuter supposed the contents of\r\nthe pollen-grain to be a ‘cellular tissue,’ and the true fertilising\r\nsubstance to be the oil which adheres to the outside of the grains,\r\nbut is formed inside them and finds its way out through fine passages\r\nin the coat. The bursting of the pollen-grains, which his opponent\r\nGleichen thought must take place to allow of the escape of his supposed\r\nspermatozoids, seemed to him an unnatural proceeding.\r\n\r\nStarting from the hypothesis, that the oil which clings to the\r\npollen-grains is the fertilising substance, Koelreuter propounds his\r\nview of the process of fertilisation in accordance with the chemical\r\nnotions of the day; he first rejects the idea that the pollen-grains\r\nthemselves can reach the ovary, and then says: ‘Both the male seed and\r\nthe female moisture on the stigmas are of an oily nature, and therefore\r\nwhen they come together enter into a most intimate union with one\r\nanother, and form a substance which, if fertilisation is to ensue,\r\nmust be absorbed by the stigma and conveyed through the style to the\r\nso-called ovules or unfertilised germs.’ Koelreuter therefore made the\r\nfertilisation really take place on the stigma, the mingled male and\r\nfemale substance making its way into the ovary and there producing the\r\nembryos in the seed. He had expressed this view before in 1761; he\r\nrepeated it in 1763 with the idea that the male and female moistures\r\nunite together, as an acid and an alkali unite to form a neutral\r\nsalt; a new living organism is the result at once or later of this\r\nunion. In an investigation which he made in 1775 into the conditions\r\nof pollination in Asclepiadeae he reverted to this idea, and insisted\r\nthat the act of fertilisation in the whole vegetable and animal kingdom\r\nis a mingling of two fluids. But at a later period he seems to have\r\nno longer considered the moisture of the stigma to be the female\r\nprinciple, for experiment had taught him, that if a stigma exchanges\r\nthe moisture from another stigma for its own, and is then dusted with\r\nits own pollen, no hybrid form is produced[106]. In any case Koelreuter\r\nhad a more correct idea of the nature of sexual fertilisation than\r\nany of his predecessors, and it was one specially adapted to enable\r\nhis contemporaries to understand the results of experiments in\r\nhybridisation, while the hybrids themselves supplied most convincing\r\narguments against the prevailing theory of evolution.\r\n\r\nWe have arrived at Koelreuter’s most important performance, the\r\nproduction of hybrids. Here was a case for skilful experimentation,\r\nnot for microscopic observation, and here he obtained results in which\r\nnothing afterwards required to be changed, but which when combined\r\nwith later observations have been used for the discovery of general\r\nlaws in hybridisation. The first hybrid which he obtained by placing\r\nthe pollen of Nicotiana paniculata on the stigmas of N. rustica,\r\nproduced pollen that was impotent; but he soon after obtained hybrids\r\nfrom the two species which produced seeds capable of germination, and\r\nin 1763 he described a considerable number of hybrids in the genera\r\nNicotiana, Kedmia, Dianthus, Matthiola, Hyoscyamus, and others. In the\r\nlast portion of his great work (1766) he speaks of eighteen attempts\r\nto obtain hybrids with five native species of Verbascum, and submits\r\nLinnaeus’ views on hybrid plants, which we have already described,\r\nto a withering criticism. He shows at the same time from experiment,\r\nthat if the stigma of a plant receives its own pollen and pollen from\r\nanother plant at the same time, the former only is effectual, and that\r\nthis is one reason why hybrids which can be raised artificially are\r\nnot found in nature. We must not attempt to give a detailed account of\r\nhis famous hybrids of the third, fourth, and fifth degrees, nor of his\r\nexperiments on other points, such as the reverting of hybrids to the\r\noriginal form by the repeated employment of its pollen; the value of\r\nthese experiments for theoretical purposes was afterwards fully brought\r\nout by Nägeli.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to rate too highly the general speculative value of\r\nKoelreuter’s artificial hybridisation. The mingling of the characters\r\nof the two parents was the best refutation of the theory of evolution,\r\nand supplied at the same time profound views of the true nature of the\r\nsexual union. It was shown by his numerous experiments that only nearly\r\nallied plants and not always these are capable of sexual union, which\r\nat once disposed of Linnaeus’ vague ideas in the judgment of every\r\ncapable person, though it was long before science candidly accepted\r\nKoelreuter’s results. The plant-collectors of the Linnaean school as\r\nwell as the true systematists at the end of the 18th century had little\r\nunderstanding for such labours as Koelreuter’s, and incorrect ideas on\r\nhybrids and their power of maintaining themselves prevailed in spite\r\nof them in botanical literature. Hybrids were necessarily inconvenient\r\nto the believers in the constancy of species; they, disturbed the\r\ncompactness of their system and would not fit in with the notion that\r\nevery species represented an ‘idea.’\r\n\r\nKoelreuter’s doctrines however did not always fall on unfruitful soil;\r\ntwo botanists at least were found in Germany who adopted them, Joseph\r\nGärtner the author of the famous Carpology and father of Carl Friedrich\r\nGärtner who at a later time spent twenty-five years in experimenting\r\non fertilisation and hybridisation, and Konrad Sprengel who took up\r\nKoelreuter’s discovery of the services rendered by insects and arrived\r\nat some new and very remarkable results.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH GÄRTNER made no fresh observations on sexuality himself, but\r\nin the Introduction to his ‘De fructibus et seminibus plantarum’\r\n(1788) he made use of Koelreuter’s results for the purpose of\r\ndistinguishing more clearly between different kinds of propagation,\r\nand strengthening his own attack on the theory of evolution. The\r\ngerm-grains or spores of cryptogamic plants were at that time often\r\nregarded on insufficient grounds as true seeds; Gärtner distinguished\r\nthem from seeds, because they are formed without fertilisation and\r\nyet are capable of germination, whereas ovules become seeds capable\r\nof germination only under the influence of the pollen. He distinctly\r\ndenied the sexuality of the Cryptogams; it was not till fifty years\r\nlater that strict scientific proof was substituted in this department\r\nof botany for vague conjecture, and it was more in the interest of\r\ntrue science in Gärtner’s day to deny sexuality in the Cryptogams\r\naltogether, than to take the stomata in Ferns with Gleichen, or the\r\nindusium with Koelreuter, or the volva in Mushrooms for the male organs\r\nof fertilisation. Gärtner rightly appealed to Koelreuter’s hybrids\r\nagainst the defenders of the theory of evolution; and to those who saw\r\nin the seed only another form of vegetative bud, he said, that the bud\r\ncan produce a new plant without fertilisation but that the seed cannot.\r\nWe have already given an account in the chapters on Systematic Botany\r\nof the services rendered by Gärtner to the knowledge of the seed in\r\nits immature and in its mature condition; as regards the process of\r\nfertilisation he adopted in the main Koelreuter’s view, that it is\r\nthe result of the union of a male and female fluid, from which the\r\ngerm-corpuscle in the ovule is developed by a kind of crystallisation.\r\nKonrad Sprengel also fully committed himself to this view, and was\r\nthereby prevented from understanding the process of fertilisation in\r\nAsclepiadeae.\r\n\r\nIn KONRAD SPRENGEL[107] we encounter once more an observer of genius,\r\nlike Camerarius and Koelreuter, who however surpassed them both in\r\nboldness of conception and was therefore even less understood by his\r\ncontemporaries and successors, than they had been by theirs. The\r\nconclusions, to which his investigations led him, were so surprising,\r\nthey suited so little with the dry systematism of the Linnaean school\r\nand with later views on the nature of plants, that they had become\r\nquite forgotten when Darwin brought them again before the world and\r\nshowed their important bearing on the theory of descent. As Camerarius\r\nfirst proved that plants possess sexuality, and Koelreuter showed that\r\nplants of different species can unite sexually and produce fruitful\r\nhybrids, so now Sprengel showed that a certain form of hybridisation\r\nis common in the vegetable kingdom, namely the crossing of different\r\nflowers or different individuals of the same species. In his work,\r\n‘Das neu entdeckte Geheimniss der Natur in Bau und Befruchtung der\r\nBlumen,’ Berlin, 1793, he says at page 43: ‘Since very many flowers\r\nare dioecious, and probably at least as many hermaphrodite flowers\r\nare dichogamous, nature appears not to have intended that any flower\r\nshould be fertilised by its own pollen.’ This was however only one of\r\nhis surprising conclusions; still more important perhaps was the view,\r\nthat the construction and all the peculiar characters of a flower can\r\nonly be understood from their relation to the insects that visit them\r\nand effect their pollination; here was the first attempt to explain the\r\norigin of organic forms from definite relations to their environment.\r\nSince Darwin breathed new life into these ideas by the theory of\r\nselection, Sprengel has been recognised as one of its chief supports.\r\n\r\nIt is highly interesting to read, how this speculative mind by the\r\nstudy of structural relations in flowers, which were apparently trivial\r\nand open to the eyes of all men, first arrived at ideas which in the\r\ncourse of a few years were to lead to such far-reaching results. He\r\nsays: ‘In the summer of 1787 I was attentively examining the flowers\r\nof Geranium sylvaticum, and observed that the lower part of the petals\r\nwas provided with slender rough hairs on the inside and on both edges.\r\nConvinced that the wise framer of nature has not produced a single hair\r\nwithout a definite purpose, I considered what end these hairs might be\r\nintended to serve. And it soon occurred to me, that on the supposition\r\nthat the five drops of juice which are secreted by the same number of\r\nglands are intended for the food of certain insects, it is not unlikely\r\nthat there is some provision for protecting this juice from being\r\nspoiled by rain, and that the hairs might have been placed where they\r\nare for this purpose. Since the flower is upright, and tolerably large,\r\ndrops of rain must fall into it when it rains. But no drop of rain can\r\nreach one of the drops of juice and mix with it, because it is stopped\r\nby the hairs, which are over the juice-drops, just as a drop of sweat\r\nfalling down a man’s brow is stopped by the eye-brow and eye-lash, and\r\nhindered from running into the eye. An insect is not hindered by these\r\nhairs from getting at the drops of juice. I examined other flowers\r\nand found that several of them had something in their structure,\r\nwhich seemed exactly to serve this end. The longer I continued this\r\ninvestigation, the more I saw that flowers which contain this kind of\r\njuice are so contrived, that insects can easily reach it, but that\r\nthe rain cannot spoil it; but I gathered from this that it is for the\r\nsake of the insects that these flowers secrete the juice, and that it\r\nis secured against rain that they may be able to enjoy it pure and\r\nunspoilt.’ Next year, following out an idea suggested by the flowers of\r\nMyosotis palustris, he found that the position of spots of different\r\ncolours on the corolla have some connection with the place where the\r\njuice is secreted, and with the same ready reasoning as before he came\r\nto the further conclusion: ‘If the corolla has a particular colour in\r\nparticular spots on account of the insects, it is for the sake of the\r\ninsects that it is so coloured; and if the particular colour of a part\r\nof the corolla serves to show an insect which has lighted on the flower\r\nthe direct path to the juice, the general colour of the corolla has\r\nbeen given to it, in order that insects flying about in search of their\r\nfood may see the flowers that are provided with such a corolla from a\r\nlong distance, and know them for receptacles of juice.’\r\n\r\nHe afterwards discovered that the stigmas of a species of Iris were\r\nabsolutely unable to be fertilised in any other way than by insects,\r\nand further observation convinced him more and more, ‘that many,\r\nperhaps all flowers, which have this juice, are fertilised by the\r\ninsects which feed on it, and that consequently this feeding of insects\r\nis in respect of themselves an end, but in respect of the flowers only\r\na means, but at the same time the sole means to a definite end, namely,\r\ntheir fertilisation; and that the whole structure of such flowers can\r\nbe explained, if in examining them we keep in sight the following\r\npoints, first, that flowers were intended to be fertilised by the\r\nagency of one or another kind of insects, or by several; secondly, that\r\ninsects in seeking the juice of flowers, and for this purpose either\r\nalighting upon them in an indefinite manner, or in a definite manner\r\neither creeping into them or moving round upon them, were intended to\r\nsweep off the dust from the anthers with their usually hairy bodies or\r\nwith some part of them, and convey it to the stigma, which is provided\r\neither with short and delicate hairs, or with a viscid moisture, that\r\nit may retain the pollen.’\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1790 he detected dichogamy, which he first observed\r\nin Epilobium angustifolium. He found, ‘that these hermaphrodite\r\nflowers are fertilised by the humble-bee and by other bees, and that\r\nthe individual flower is not fertilised by its own pollen, but the\r\nolder flowers by the pollen which the insects convey to them from\r\nthe younger.’ Having observed the same thing in Nigella arvensis,\r\nhe afterwards found exactly the opposite arrangement in a species of\r\nEuphorbia, in which the stigmas can receive the pollen by the aid of\r\ninsects only from older flowers.\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say that he grounds his theory of flowers on these\r\nhis six chief discoveries made in the course of five years; he then\r\ngives his theory at length, first of all explaining the nature of\r\njuice-secreting glands (nectaries), and organs for receiving or\r\ncovering the nectar, and the contrivances for enabling insects to find\r\ntheir way readily to the juice. He calls attention to Koelreuter’s\r\nexcellent observations on the fertilisation of nectar-bearing flowers\r\nby insects, and notices that no one has hitherto shown that the whole\r\nstructure of such flowers has this object in view, and can be fully\r\nexplained by it. He finds the chief proof of this important proposition\r\nin dichogamy.\r\n\r\n‘After the flower,’ he says, ‘has opened in dichogamous plants, the\r\nfilaments have or assume either all at once or one after another a\r\ndefinite position, in which the anthers open and offer their pollen for\r\nfertilisation. But at this time the stigma is at some distance from\r\nthe anthers and is still small and closed. Hence the pollen cannot be\r\nconveyed to the stigma either by mechanical means or by insects, for\r\nthere is as yet properly no stigma. This condition of things continues\r\na certain time. When that time is elapsed, the anthers have no longer\r\nany pollen, and changes take place in the filaments the result of which\r\nis that the anthers no longer occupy their former position. Meanwhile\r\nthe pistil has so changed that the stigma is now exactly in the place\r\nwhere the anthers were before, and as it now opens, or expands the\r\nparts of which it is composed, it often fills about the same space as\r\nthe anthers filled before. Now the spot, which was at first occupied by\r\nthe ripe anthers and is now occupied by the ripe stigma, is so chosen\r\nin each flower, that the insect for which the flower is intended cannot\r\nreach the juice without touching with a portion of its body the anthers\r\nin a young flower, and the stigma in an older; it thus brushes the\r\npollen from the anthers and conveys it to the stigma, and so the pollen\r\nof the younger flower fertilises the older.’ It has been already said,\r\nthat Sprengel was also acquainted with the opposite form of dichogamy;\r\nand the result of his explanation of both kinds is the conclusion,\r\nthat some flowers can only be fertilised by the aid of insects, and\r\nhe adds that some cases are to be found, in which the arrangements\r\nin the flower are of such a nature as to involve the injury and even\r\nthe death of the insect that gives its services. Further on he tells\r\nus, that all flowers, ‘which are without a proper corolla and have no\r\ncalyx of any importance in its place, are destitute of nectar, and\r\nare not fertilised by insects but by some mechanical means, as by the\r\nwind, which either blows the pollen from the anthers on to the stigmas,\r\nor shakes the plant or the flower and makes the pollen fall from the\r\nanthers on to the stigmas.’ He observes, that such flowers always\r\nproduce a light pollen and in large quantities, whereas the pollen\r\nof nectar-bearing plants is heavy. Then he shows how his principles\r\nexplain all the physiological characters of flowers, position, size,\r\ncolour, smell, form, time of flowering and the like.\r\n\r\nSprengel set out with the idea, that the nectar and certain\r\narrangements in flowers are expressly intended for the service of\r\ninsects; but his investigations led him ultimately to the conclusion,\r\nthat insects themselves serve not only to effect the fertilisation of\r\nplants generally, but also in all ordinary cases to bring about the\r\ncrossing of different flowers of the same plant or of different plants\r\nof the same species. There remained a question, which from Sprengel’s\r\nstrictly teleological point of view especially required an answer,\r\nwhat was the object of this crossing of flowers or individual plants?\r\nSprengel was content, as we have seen, with simply stating the fact,\r\nand with saying, that nature apparently did not choose that any flower\r\nshould be fertilised by its own pollen. Who would make it a reproach\r\nto the discoverer of such remarkable and widely-prevalent phenomena\r\nin nature, that he did not answer this question and give the final\r\ntouches to the body of doctrine which he created, and which could\r\nonly be developed by many experiments and the labour of long years?\r\nNeither his worldly circumstances nor the reception accorded to his\r\nwork with all its genius were such as to encourage him to undertake\r\nthe solution of this last and most difficult problem, even if he had\r\nbeen inclined to do so. Botanists were just at that time and for some\r\ntime after preoccupied with views, which allowed such biological and\r\nphysiological facts in vegetable life to lie neglected, nor were\r\nSprengel’s results at all favourable to the doctrine of the constancy\r\nof species; from that point of view the wonderful relations between the\r\norganisation of flowers and that of insects must have seemed absurd and\r\nrepulsive. In such cases it is the character of less-gifted natures,\r\nrather to deny the facts or to disregard them, than to sacrifice their\r\nown favourite views to them; this is one explanation of the neglect\r\nwhich Sprengel’s book met with everywhere. Then notwithstanding the\r\nlabours of a Camerarius and a Koelreuter there were many even at the\r\nbeginning of our own century who still doubted the sexuality of plants.\r\nEven after Knight and William Herbert, with a right understanding of\r\nthe question left open by Sprengel, had obtained experimental results\r\nwhich helped to answer it, the new doctrine did not make its way. The\r\nearlier simple-minded but consistent teleology had been succeeded\r\nby a rejection of all teleological explanations in the treatment of\r\nphysiological questions, and this spirit conduced to make Sprengel’s\r\nresults seem inconvenient in proportion as they appeared to admit only\r\nof such explanation. With regard to phenomena of this kind botanists\r\nbefore 1860 were in a position, in which they were without the means\r\nof forming a judgment; they shrank from the teleological point of\r\nview and from believing with Konrad Sprengel, that every, even the\r\nleast-obvious, arrangement in an organism was the direct work of a\r\nCreator; but they had nothing better to put in the place of this idea,\r\nand hence Sprengel’s discoveries not being understood were neglected\r\ntill Darwin recognised all their importance, and by opposing the theory\r\nof descent and selection to the principle of design was in a position\r\nnot only to show that they had a scientific meaning, but also to employ\r\nthem as powerful supports of the theory of selection. Then, too, it\r\nbecame possible rightly to appreciate the contributions of Knight,\r\nHerbert, and K. F. Gärtner to the further completion of Sprengel’s\r\ndoctrine, for their discoveries also were for a while neglected. A\r\nfew years after the appearance of Sprengel’s book, Andrew Knight[108]\r\nrelying on the results of experiments made for the purpose of comparing\r\nself-fertilisation and crossing in the genus Pisum, laid down the\r\nprinciple, that no plant fertilises itself through an unlimited number\r\nof generations; in 1837 Herbert summed up the results of his numerous\r\nexperiments in fertilisation in the statement, that he was inclined\r\nto believe that he attained a better result, when he fertilised the\r\nflowers from which he wished to obtain seeds with pollen from another\r\nindividual of the same variety or at least from another flower, than\r\nwhen he fertilised it with its own pollen; K. F. Gärtner came to the\r\nsame conclusion after experiments in fertilising Passiflora, Lobelia,\r\nand species of Fuchsia in 1844. In these observations lay the first\r\ngerm of the answer to the question left undecided by Sprengel, why\r\nmost flowers are so constructed that fertilisation can only be fully\r\neffected by the crossing of different flowers or of different plants of\r\nthe same species; the artificial crossings of this kind, which Knight,\r\nHerbert, and Gärtner compared with the self-fertilisation of single\r\nflowers, showed that crossing procures a more complete and vigorous\r\nimpregnation than self-fertilisation. It was but a short step from this\r\nfact to the idea, that the arrangements in the flower discovered by\r\nSprengel together with the aid of insects serve to secure the strongest\r\nand most numerous progeny possible. Darwin was the first who fixed his\r\neye distinctly on this idea also, in order to employ it in his theory\r\nof selection, and sought support for it in a number of experiments made\r\nafter 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. NEW OPPONENTS OF SEXUALITY AND THEIR REFUTATION BY EXPERIMENTS.\r\n1785-1849.\r\n\r\nThose who have read the writings of Camerarius and Koelreuter\r\ncarefully find it difficult to believe, that after their time doubts\r\nwere still entertained not about the manner in which the processes\r\nof fertilisation are accomplished but about the actual existence\r\nof difference of sex in plants. And yet such doubts were expressed\r\nrepeatedly during the succeeding sixty years in various quarters and\r\nwith the greatest confidence, and this not in consequence of increased\r\naccuracy in experimental research or of contradictions that could\r\nbe proved in the views of the founders of the sexual theory, but\r\nbecause a number of observers made unskilful experiments and obtained\r\ncontradictory results, or made inaccurate observations on the plants on\r\nwhich they experimented, and generally had not the requisite experience\r\nand circumspection. Such were Spallanzani and later Bernhardi, Giron\r\nde Bouzareingue and Ramisch. Schelver, his pupil Henschel, and their\r\nadherents erred still more grossly and from a different cause; they\r\nthought themselves justified by preconceived opinions and conclusions\r\nfrom the nature-philosophy in denying facts established by experiment.\r\nThe destructive effects of the nature-philosophy on the powers of\r\nthe understanding at the beginning of the 19th century was shown\r\nin the case of many botanists, who were no longer able to estimate\r\nthe result of simple experiments, and to trace back the phenomena\r\nof nature to the scheme of causes and effects. As Linnaeus once\r\nimagined that he could prove sexuality in plants on philosophical\r\ngrounds and paid comparatively slight attention to their behaviour\r\nas shown by experiment, so we have in Schelver a nature-philosopher\r\nwho conversely endeavoured to prove the impossibility of sexuality in\r\nplants on philosophical grounds. As Linnaeus deduced sexuality from\r\nthe nature or idea of the plant, Schelver denied it from the same\r\nnature or idea; as a matter of logic one was as much in the right as\r\nthe other, but the question could not be decided in this way but only\r\nby experiment. However our nature-philosophers thought it advisable\r\nto get some empirical support for their theories, and they found it\r\nin SPALLANZANI[109]. He published his enquiries into fertilisation\r\nin animals and plants under the title ‘Expériences pour servir à\r\nl’histoire de la génération des animaux et des plantes,’ Geneva,\r\n1786; his account of those relating to plants, with which only we\r\nare concerned, betrays a very defective acquaintance with botanical\r\nliterature, for he reckons Cesalpino among those who had admitted\r\nsexuality in plants. His experiments themselves testify to very slight\r\nknowledge of the biological considerations by which the cultivation of\r\nplants for experiment must be guided, and generally little botanical\r\nacumen, as is often the case with amateurs who without sufficient\r\npreparation suddenly turn their attention to questions of vegetable\r\nphysiology; his treatment of his topics is superficial, his criticism\r\nof others is dogmatic and bitter without exciting confidence in the\r\nauthor’s own skill and judgment. His experiments were often undertaken\r\nin haste and with little consideration, and some of them were made on\r\nplants the least suitable for such investigations, as for instance\r\non Genista, beans, peas, radishes, Basilicum, Delphinium. It is no\r\nmatter of surprise therefore that in the case of some plants, as\r\nMercurialis and Basilicum, he arrived at the conclusion that the pollen\r\nis necessary to the production of fertile seeds, while he makes others,\r\nas the gourd, the water-melon, hemp, and spinach produce such seeds\r\nwithout fertilisation. His countryman Volta, a greater man, repeated\r\nhis experiments and impugned the results which he had obtained from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSuch was the character of the experiments to which Franz Joseph\r\nSchelver, Professor of Medicine in Heidelberg appealed in his ‘Kritik\r\nder Lehre von dem Geschlecht der Pflanzen,’ 1812. It is unnecessary\r\nto give a detailed account of this strange production of a mind\r\nmisled, even though a considerable number of German botanists as late\r\nas 1820 took its nonsense for profound wisdom. Schelver dismissed\r\nthe experiments of Camerarius in four lines, and while he treated\r\nKoelreuter with contempt, he praised Spallanzani as the weightiest\r\nauthor on the subject. The statements of Camerarius and Koelreuter\r\nare true, he said, but they do not prove the fertilisation. He is\r\nmore concerned to decide the question from the nature of vegetative\r\nlife, and from this nature constructed by himself he concludes that\r\nthe organs of plants are of no use at all, that they cannot even tend\r\nto be of use to one another and to propagate life together, because\r\nthis one end of their action can be a living one only where all the\r\nparts are present at the same time, which of course disposes of the\r\nfertilising effect of the pollen; accordingly he does not refer the\r\neffect of a male plant on a neighbouring female plant, which results\r\nin the formation of seeds, to pollination by the former, but it is the\r\nproximity itself which has the fertilising effect. But these are very\r\ninsufficient specimens of his reasoning.\r\n\r\nThe writings of his pupil Henschel[110] are even worse than those\r\nof his master, and the worst of these is his large work ‘Von der\r\nSexualität der Pflanzen’ of 1820. He thought himself obliged to prove\r\nthe doctrines of the nature-philosophy by countless experiments; but\r\nthe way in which these are devised, managed and described displays\r\nthe extreme of dulness and incapacity to form a sound judgment. The\r\ndoubt which must occasionally rise in the mind of the reader as to the\r\naccuracy of his reports, and the remarks which have been made on this\r\npoint by Treviranus and Gärtner, are not needed to disgust him with the\r\nscientific efforts of this writer.\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to give an account of the contents of\r\nHenschel’s book, which is interesting from the pathological rather\r\nthan from the historical point of view. To what an extent better men\r\nthan Henschel even later than 1820 lost under the influence of the\r\nnature-philosophy their capacity for judging such questions as we are\r\ndiscussing, how even investigators of merit thought it worth while\r\nto treat the productions of Schelver and Henschel with a certain\r\nrespect, is shown among other works, by a collection of letters, which\r\nwere published by Nees von Esenbeck as a second supplement to the\r\n‘Regensberg Flora’ of 1821, and by the later remarks of Goethe on the\r\nmetamorphosis of plants, to be found in Cotta’s edition of his works\r\nin forty volumes (vol. xxxvi. p. 134) under the title ‘Verstäubung,\r\nVerdunstung, Vertropfung.’ But there were some who set themselves\r\ndistinctly against these pernicious ideas, such as Paula Schrank\r\n(‘Flora,’ 1822, p. 49) and C. L. Treviranus, who published in 1822\r\na full refutation of Henschel in his ‘Lehre von dem Geschlecht der\r\nPflanzen in Bezug auf die neuesten Angriffe erwogen.’ A few stray\r\nsupporters of the dying nature-philosophy were still to be found at a\r\nlater time; among them Wilbrand, Professor in Giessen, who (‘Flora,’\r\n1830, p. 585) adopted the very subtle distinction that there is in\r\nplants something analogous to sexuality in animals, but no real\r\nsexuality. We see in the whole literature of the nature-philosophy\r\nan incapability of judging of experiments simply with the sound human\r\nunderstanding; an imaginary something was constantly introduced into\r\nthe results of experiments which had not the remotest connection with\r\ntheir conditions and results.\r\n\r\nThe doubts expressed by Bernhardi in 1811, by Girou in 1828-30, and by\r\nRamisch in 1837 were of a different kind: these men made experiments\r\nand judged of them in a scientific manner; but they were insufficiently\r\nacquainted with what had been done before them, and their experiments\r\nwere not devised with the requisite knowledge of the conditions of the\r\nproblem, or carried out with sufficient precautions. Camerarius and\r\nRay had noticed in the previous century the occasional occurrence of\r\nmale flowers on female plants of spinach, hemp and mercury; and yet\r\nthe observers above mentioned chose these plants for their experiments\r\nwithout being on their guard against the possible appearance of these\r\nexceptional circumstances, or of other means of pollination.\r\n\r\nWe see then that doubts were entertained till as late as after 1830\r\nwith regard either to sexuality in plants altogether, or to its general\r\nprevalence in Phanerogams; the Cryptogams were not mentioned, for they\r\nwere assumed to be devoid of sex in spite of many valuable observations\r\nof earlier times. The great majority of botanists however admitted the\r\nsexual significance of the organs of the flower; most of them rested in\r\nentire faith on Linnaeus’ authority, while some were able to appreciate\r\nthe experimental proofs of Camerarius, Bradley, Logan, Gleditsch and\r\nKoelreuter. But all who took up the subject in earnest between 1820\r\nand 1840 were naturally led to desire that the question should once\r\nmore be thoroughly examined. The Berlin Academy of science had offered\r\nin 1819 at Link’s suggestion a prize for an essay on the question,\r\nwhether there is such a thing as hybrid fertilisation in the vegetable\r\nkingdom, in the hope of stimulating botanists to new investigations\r\ninto the decisive points in the sexual theory. The only reply to\r\nthis offer, an essay by Wiegmann which was not sent in till 1828, did\r\nnot come up to the requirements of the Academy, and was rewarded with\r\nonly half the prize. The Dutch Academy at Haarlem was more successful\r\nwhen induced by Reinwardt in 1830 to propose the question in a\r\nsomewhat altered form and in connection with practical horticulture.\r\nThis prize was contended for by KARL FRIEDRICH GÄRTNER[111], whose\r\nessay delayed by circumstances till 1837 received the prize of honour\r\nand an extraordinary reward. But the whole body of his results,\r\nderived from the experimental researches of five-and-twenty years,\r\nwere not published till 1849 and then in a large volume, ‘Versuche\r\nund Beobachtungen über die Bastardzeugung,’ Stuttgart, 1849, having\r\nbeen preceded by an introductory work of equal extent, ‘Versuche und\r\nBeobachtungen über die Befruchtungsorgane der vollkommeneren Gewächse\r\nund über die natürliche und künstliche Befruchtung durch den eigenen\r\nPollen.’ The two works together are the most thorough and complete\r\naccount of experimental investigation into sexual relations in plants\r\nwhich had yet been written. They are a brilliant termination of the\r\nperiod of doubt with respect to sexuality in plants which succeeded\r\nto the age of Koelreuter—a termination which coincides in time with\r\nthe lively discussion which was being maintained on the strength of\r\nmicroscopical investigations by Schleiden and Schacht on the one\r\nside and by Hofmeister on the other respecting the processes in the\r\nformation of the embryo.\r\n\r\nGärtner’s writings derive their importance not so much from new and\r\nsurprising discoveries or brilliant ideas and unexpected combinations,\r\nas from their very searching examination into all the circumstances and\r\nrelations which can come under consideration in the sexual propagation\r\nof Phanerogams. His experiments in hybridisation, of which he kept\r\nmost exact accounts, exceeded the number of nine thousand; in these\r\nand in normal cases of pollination he studied all the sources of error\r\nwhich could in any way affect his experiments, and took into careful\r\nconsideration all the conditions of fertilisation connected with the\r\ndevelopment of the plant itself and with its external circumstances; at\r\nthe same time he examined critically all that had been written on the\r\nsubject, and submitted every experiment reported by former observers to\r\nthe test of his own wide experience. The volume on self-fertilisation\r\nis a complete account of the biology and physiology of flowers. The\r\nphenomena connected with the unfolding and fertilisation of the flower\r\nare described from the writer’s own observations, some of which are\r\nquite new; it specially investigates the relations between the calyx,\r\nthe corolla, the secretion of nectar and the opening of the anthers,\r\nalso the temperature of flowers and the physiological processes in\r\nthe ovary, the style and the stigma; all that was then known of\r\nirritability and the phenomena of movement in the flower and in the\r\norgans of fructification was collected together and elucidated by fresh\r\nobservations, and thus a picture was drawn complete to the smallest\r\ndetail of the life of a flower, such as we do not yet possess of any\r\nother organ. It would be idle to think of giving in a small compass\r\na clear idea of the wealth of these observations. But all this was\r\nonly preliminary to the main point, the proof that Camerarius was\r\nright, that notwithstanding the objections of a hundred years the\r\nco-operation of the pollen is indispensable to the formation of the\r\nembryo in the growing seed, and that plants therefore have sexuality\r\nexactly as animals have it. Gärtner did not content himself with simply\r\nmaking new experiments in fertilisation; he refuted the objections of\r\nSpallanzani, Schelver, Henschel, Girou and others in detail from fresh\r\nexperiments and from other sources of information, paying particular\r\nregard to all the circumstances which could come under consideration\r\nin each case; he exposed the inaccuracy of the observations of the\r\nopponents of sexuality point by point, and finally called attention to\r\na number of remarkable phenomena observable in the ovary even before\r\nfertilisation, and to the circumstances under which the pollen may find\r\nits way to it in cases where ordinary pollination has been apparently\r\nprevented. These observations once more confirmed the existence of\r\nsexuality in plants, and in such a manner that it could never be\r\nagain disputed. When facts were observed in 1860, which led to the\r\npresumption that under certain circumstances in certain individuals of\r\nsome species of plants the female organs might produce embryos capable\r\nof development without the help of the male, there was no thought of\r\nusing these cases of parthenogenesis to disprove the existence of\r\nsexuality as the general rule; men were concerned only to verify first\r\nof all the occurrence of the phenomena, and then to see how they were\r\nto be reasonably understood side by side with the existing sexuality,\r\nas had to be done also in the corresponding cases in the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nGärtner’s work on hybridisation had been preceded by other enquiries\r\ninto the same subject, those namely of Knight mentioned above at the\r\nbeginning of the century, and Herbert’s more ample investigations\r\npublished in his work on Amaryllideae in 1837. Gärtner did not neglect\r\nto compare his observations at all points with the results of his\r\npredecessors, especially those of Koelreuter, and he deduced from\r\nthe astonishing mass of material a number of general propositions\r\nrespecting the conditions under which the production of hybrids is\r\npossible, the results of crossing, and the causes of failure. A\r\nspecial interest attaches to his mixed and compound hybrids, to his\r\nexperiments on the various degrees of influence which foreign pollen\r\nexercises on the behaviour of the female organ, and the connection of\r\nthis point with the formation of varieties. It is impossible to give\r\na more distinct account of Gärtner’s results without entering into\r\ndiscussions which would exceed the limits of a historical survey. It is\r\nthe less necessary to do so, since Nägeli undertook in 1865 to give a\r\nsummary view of all the important results to be found in the wealth of\r\nmaterial supplied by Koelreuter, Herbert and Gärtner[112]. Gärtner’s\r\nexperiments in hybridisation were conducted at Calw in Würtemberg,\r\nthe place where Koelreuter had made his in 1762 and 1763. And thus\r\nit was in two small cities of Würtemberg that the foundations of the\r\nsexual theory were laid and the theory itself perfected, as far as\r\nit could be by experiment only, by three of the most eminent among\r\nobservers. Camerarius in Tübingen, Koelreuter and K. F. Gärtner in Calw\r\ncontributed so largely to the empirical establishment of the theory,\r\nthat all that was done by others would seem of small importance, if\r\nartificial pollination only were in question. But Koelreuter was\r\nimperfectly acquainted with the methods by which pollination is\r\nusually effected in nature; Sprengel was the first who saw into all\r\ntheir more important relations, and the fact must not be concealed,\r\nthat Gärtner in regarding Konrad Sprengel’s observations as unworthy\r\nof serious consideration, neglected the most fruitful source of new\r\nand magnificent results. His careful study of the secreting of nectar\r\nand of the sensitiveness of the organs of fertilisation, and his many\r\nobservations on other biological relations in flowers, would have\r\nfound their natural termination, if he had connected them at all\r\npoints with Sprengel’s general conclusions respecting the relation\r\nof the structure of the flower to the insect world. This Gärtner\r\nentirely failed to do, and hence in this case also it was reserved\r\nfor Darwin’s wonderful talent for combination to sum up the product\r\nof the investigations of a hundred years, and to blend Koelreuter’s,\r\nKnight’s, Herbert’s, and Gärtner’s results with Sprengel’s theory\r\nof flowers into a living whole in such a manner, that now all the\r\nphysiological arrangements in the flower have become intelligible both\r\nin their relations to fertilisation, and in their dependence on the\r\nnatural conditions under which pollination takes place without the aid\r\nof man. Here, as in morphology and systematic botany, Darwin found\r\nthe premisses given and drew the conclusion from them; here too the\r\ncertainty of his theory rests on the results of the best observers, on\r\ninvestigations which find in that theory their necessary logical and\r\nhistorical consummation.\r\n\r\n 7. MICROSCOPIC INVESTIGATION INTO THE PROCESSES OF FERTILISATION IN\r\n THE PHANEROGAMS; POLLEN-TUBE AND EGG-CELLS[113]. 1830-1850.\r\n\r\nThose who were convinced of the sexuality of plants had endeavoured as\r\nearly as the previous century to form some idea with the help of the\r\nmicroscope of the way in which the pollen effects the formation of the\r\nembryo in the ovule. We may pass over Morland’s and Geoffroy’s very\r\nrude attempts in this direction: Needham (1750), Jussieu, Linnaeus,\r\nGleichen, and Hedwig imagined that the pollen-grain bursts upon the\r\nstigma, and that the granules it contains make their way downwards\r\nthrough the style to the ovules, and are there either hatched into\r\nembryos or assist in their production. This way of conceiving the\r\nmatter was closely connected with the theory of evolution which then\r\nprevailed, and seemed to find some countenance in the seed-corpuscles\r\nof animals; it was also supported by the observation that pollen-grains\r\nplaced under the microscope in water often burst and discharge their\r\ncontents in the form of a granular mucilage. It has been already\r\nmentioned that Koelreuter rejected this view; he declared the bursting\r\nof the pollen-grains to be contrary to nature, and considered the oil\r\nwhich exudes from the grains to be the fertilising substance. This\r\nview was adopted by Joseph Gärtner and Sprengel, but it fell into\r\ndisesteem, while that of Needham and Gleichen commanded some assent\r\nsome years longer. The next question was, how the granular contents of\r\nthe pollen-grain reach the ovules. Accident supplied a starting-point\r\nfor further consideration. Amici, who was examining the hairs on the\r\nstigma of Portulaca for another purpose, saw on that occasion (1823)\r\nthe pollen-tube emerge from the pollen-grain, and the granular contents\r\nof the latter, commonly known as the fovilla, execute streaming\r\nmovements like the well-known movement in Chara. The desire to verify\r\nthis remarkable fact, and to discover how the fertilising substance\r\nis absorbed by the stigma, led Brongniart in 1826 to examine a great\r\nnumber of pollinated stigmas. He succeeded in establishing the fact\r\nthat the formation of pollen-tubes is a very frequent occurrence.\r\nThe want of perseverance in following out his observation and a\r\nprepossession in favour of Needham’s old theory prevented him from\r\ndiscovering the course of the pollen-tubes all the way to the ovules;\r\nhe supposed, indeed, that after penetrating into the stigma they open\r\nand discharge their granular contents, and he maintained distinctly\r\nthat these are analogous to the spermatozoids in animals, and are\r\nthe active part of the pollen. But now Amici addressed himself more\r\nearnestly to the question, and in 1830 he not only followed the\r\npollen-tubes into the ovary, but also observed that one finds its way\r\ninto the micropyle of each ovule.\r\n\r\nThus the question was suddenly brought near to its solution, when\r\nobservers began to wander from the right path in different directions.\r\nRobert Brown showed in 1831 and 1833 that the grains in the\r\npollen-masses of Orchids and Asclepiads put forth pollen-tubes as in\r\nother plants, and that fine tubes are found in the ovary of Orchids\r\nin which pollination has taken place; but he was in doubt about the\r\nconnection of these tubes with the pollen-grains, and rather inclined\r\nto think that they were formed in the ovary, though possibly in\r\nconsequence of the pollination of the stigma. Schleiden went wrong in a\r\nvery different way, and by so doing made the question as prominent in\r\nbotanical research, as was that of the origin of cells at this time.\r\nHe published in 1837 some excellent investigations into the origin and\r\ndevelopment of the ovule before fertilisation, certainly the best and\r\nmost thorough of the day. He at the same time showed that Brongniart’s\r\nand Brown’s doubts were unfounded, and confirmed the statement of\r\nAmici, that the pollen-tubes make their way from the stigma to the\r\novule, which they enter through the micropyle. But he made them\r\npush forward a little too far, for he asserted positively that ‘the\r\npollen-tube pushes the membrane of the embryo-sac before it, making an\r\nindentation, and its extremity then appears to lie in the embryo-sac.\r\nThe extremity of the tube now swells out into a round or oval shape,\r\nand cell-tissue forms from its contents; the lateral organs, one or\r\ntwo cotyledons, are then produced, the original apical point remaining\r\nmore or less free and forming the plumule. The portion of the tube\r\nunderneath the embryo and the fold of the embryo-sac which envelopes\r\nit are divided off sooner or later and disappear, so that the embryo\r\nnow really lies in the embryo-sac.’ This view, which appears to rest\r\non direct observation and is illustrated by figures which answer to\r\nthe description, corresponds with the old theory of evolution and has\r\na striking approximation to the ideas of Morland and Geoffroy; and if\r\nit were correct, it would like these imply the necessity of pollination\r\nto the formation of seeds that should contain embryos, but at the same\r\ntime it would do away with that which is the essential point in the\r\nsexuality of plants, for the ovule would merely be the spot adapted to\r\nthe hatching of the embryo formed from the pollen. Schleiden’s idea\r\nwas at once adopted by Wydler, Gelesnow and various other botanists,\r\nand especially by Schacht, but the most eminent microscopists withheld\r\ntheir assent. Amici was the first who openly opposed the new doctrine;\r\nbefore the Italian congress of savants at Padua in 1842 he endeavoured\r\nto prove that the embryo is not formed at the end of the pollen-tube,\r\nbut from a portion of the ovule which was already in existence before\r\nfertilisation, and that this part is fertilised by the fluid contained\r\nin the pollen-tube. But the choice of a gourd, a plant eminently\r\nunsuitable for his purpose, prevented his discovering the exact\r\ndetails of the process, and Schleiden did not hesitate to denounce his\r\nassertions in 1845 in the plainest terms. But in the next year (1846)\r\nAmici produced decisive proof for the views which he had maintained;\r\nhe showed from the Orchidaceae, which were peculiarly well adapted\r\nfor such investigations, not only that Robert Brown’s doubts above\r\nmentioned were without foundation, but, which is the main point, that\r\na body, the egg-cell, is present in the embryo-sac of the ovule before\r\nthe arrival of the pollen-tube, and that this body is excited by the\r\npresence of the pollen-tube to further development, the formation of\r\nthe embryo. He gave a connected account on this occasion for the first\r\ntime of the whole course of these processes from the pollination of the\r\nstigma to the perfecting of the embryo.\r\n\r\nThe correctness of the account given by Amici was confirmed in the\r\nfollowing year by von Mohl and Hofmeister, the latter of whom described\r\nin detail the points which were decisive of the question from a\r\nvariety of plants, and illustrated them by very beautiful figures in\r\na more copious work, ‘Die Enstehung des Embryo der Phanerogamen,’\r\nLeipzig, 1849. Tulasne also came forward in opposition to Schleiden’s\r\ntheory, being thoroughly convinced that there was no actual contact\r\nof the pollen-tube with the egg-cell, denying indeed the existence of\r\nthe egg-cell before fertilisation. Thus a vehement controversy arose\r\non the subject; a prize offered by the Institute of the Netherlands\r\nat Amsterdam was awarded to an essay of Schacht’s in 1850, which\r\ndefended Schleiden’s theory, and illustrated it by a great number of\r\ndrawings giving incorrect and indeed inconceivable representations of\r\nthe decisive points. Von Mohl says very admirably on this occasion\r\n(‘Botanische Zeitung,’ 1863, Beilage, p. 7): ‘Now that we know that\r\nSchleiden’s doctrine was an illusion, it is instructive, but at the\r\nsame time sad, to see how ready men were to accept the false for the\r\ntrue; some renouncing all observation of their own dressed up the\r\nphantom in theoretical principles; others with the microscope in hand,\r\nbut led astray by their preconceptions, believed that they saw what\r\nthey could not have seen, and endeavoured to exhibit the correctness of\r\nSchleiden’s notions as raised above all doubt by the aid of hundreds\r\nof figures, which had every thing but truth to recommend them; and\r\nhow an academy by rewarding such a work gave fresh confirmation to\r\nan experience which has been repeatedly made good especially in our\r\nown subject during many years past, namely that prize-essays are\r\nlittle adapted to contribute to the solution of a doubtful question\r\nin science.’ In this case the prize-essay had been refuted before it\r\nappeared by von Mohl, Hofmeister and Tulasne. Schacht adhered all the\r\nmore firmly to Schleiden’s theory; after further controversy, in which\r\nother writers of less authority took part, Radlkofer published in 1856\r\na complete review of the question, which fully confirmed Hofmeister’s\r\nobservations, and gave incidentally an account of Schleiden’s views\r\nin the altered form which they had by that time assumed; this account\r\nshowed in fact that Schleiden had completely retracted his former\r\nopinions, and in this retractation Schacht was soon after compelled to\r\nfollow him, having become acquainted with facts observed in the ovule\r\nof Gladiolus, which were obviously irreconcilable with Schleiden’s\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nHofmeister had from the first directed special attention to the\r\nquestions, whether any bodies are found in the pollen-tube which answer\r\nin any way to spermatozoids, and whether any opening can be perceived\r\nat the end of the tube. He found indeed forms in Coniferae in 1851,\r\nwhich reminded him of the male organs of fertilisation in the higher\r\nCryptogams; but the pollen-tube was closed both in them and in the\r\nrest of the Phanerogams, in which moreover its outer coat attains to a\r\nconsiderable thickness. There remained therefore only the hypothesis,\r\nthat a fluid substance passes through the walls of the pollen-tube and\r\nof the embryo-sac and effects the fertilisation of the egg-cell; thus\r\nit was not the theory of preformation of the last century, to which\r\nBrongniart still adhered, but the view represented by Koelreuter, which\r\nultimately proved to be nearer the truth, though it may be said that\r\nall that remained of that view was, that the fertilising substance in\r\nthe Phanerogams is a fluid. The granular contents of the pollen-grains,\r\nwhich were supposed to be spermatozoids, have since been partly found\r\nto be only innocent starch-grains and drops of oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. DISCOVERY OF SEXUALITY IN THE CRYPTOGAMS. 1837-1860.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1845 no one capable of forming a judgment on the question\r\nany longer doubted the existence of different sexes in Phanerogams.\r\nBut it was not so with the Cryptogams, though a number of facts were\r\nacknowledged at this time which seemed to point to the conclusion, that\r\na moment arrives sooner or later in the course of their development\r\nalso, when a sexual act is accomplished. But the question had not\r\nas yet been systematically studied; no experimental investigations\r\nhad been made, or observations of such a kind as to demonstrate the\r\nnecessity of sexual union.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of botanists in the second half of the 18th century\r\nhad no longer any doubt that the stamens were organs of reproduction,\r\nand they were anxious to prove the existence of similar organs in\r\nthe Cryptogams; they rested in this matter on external resemblances\r\nand analogies, which they interpreted in a more or less arbitrary\r\nmanner. The obvious external resemblance between the antheridia and\r\narchegonia in Mosses and the sexual organs in the Phanerogams led\r\nSchmidel and Hedwig to consider them to be stamens and ovaries, and the\r\nconjecture was correct, though the true nature of the moss-fruit had\r\nto be learnt in another way. Micheli, Linnaeus and Dillen, trusting\r\nstill more to external appearance and with slight knowledge of these\r\nplants, had before this taken the fruit for a male flower, and in\r\nthe case of the rest of the Cryptogams the best botanists were only\r\nfeeling their way in the dark with no certain experience to guide\r\nthem. It is not necessary to give a particular account of the views\r\nwhich originated in this way; one or two may be mentioned by way of\r\nexample. Koelreuter regarded the volva of Mushrooms, Gleditsch and\r\nHedwig certain tube-like cells in their lamellae, as the male organs\r\nof fertilisation. Gleichen took the stomata, Koelreuter the indusium,\r\nHedwig even the glandular hairs of Ferns for anthers. It was not yet\r\nsuspected that the course of development and the whole morphology of\r\nthe Cryptogams could not be so compared with that of the Phanerogams;\r\ncorrect and incorrect assumptions with regard to the sexual organs\r\nof the Cryptogams were alike devoid of scientific value, being mere\r\nguesses and vague conjectures. Nor was the state of things much better\r\neven in the first years of the 19th century; and if by that time a\r\nnumber of occasional observations had been made which could afterwards\r\nbe turned to scientific account, these were as yet only isolated facts\r\nwithout scientific connection, and every one was at liberty to concede\r\nor to refuse sexual organs to the Cryptogams generally at his own\r\ndiscretion. Meanwhile observations gradually accumulated, and towards\r\n1845 it began to be possible by critical examination of them to arrive\r\nat something like a clearer understanding of this part of botany.\r\nThe majority of botanists readily accepted Schmidel’s and Hedwig’s\r\nopinion with respect to the Mosses; Vaucher had as early as 1803\r\nmaintained that the long-known conjugation of Spirogyra was a sexual\r\nact; Ehrenberg observed in 1820 the conjugation of a Mould, Syzygites;\r\nBischoff and Mirbel explained the organisation of the antheridia of\r\nthe Liverworts in 1845, while Nees von Esenbeck saw the spermatozoids\r\nof Sphagnum in 1822 and Bischoff those of Chara in 1828, though they\r\nwere at first taken for Infusoria, an opinion maintained by Unger as\r\nlate as 1834. But it was Unger[114], who in 1837, after careful study\r\nof the spermatozoids of the Mosses in 1837, declared them to be the\r\nmale organs of fertilisation; in 1844 Nägeli discovered corresponding\r\nforms on the prothallium of Ferns, which had till then been called a\r\ncotyledon, and in 1846 the spermatozoids of Pilularia, the products of\r\nthe small spores which Schleiden had explained to be the pollen-grains\r\nof that plant.\r\n\r\nThese facts were of the highest importance, but little was to be made\r\nof them as long as the female organ in the plants in question, the\r\nMosses excepted, was unknown, and meanwhile it was only the resemblance\r\nbetween vegetable and animal spermatozoids which led to the conjecture,\r\nthat the one had the same sexual significance as the other.\r\n\r\nLight was suddenly thrown upon the subject, when Count Lesczyc-Suminsky\r\ndiscovered in 1848 on the supposed cotyledon (prothallium) of Ferns\r\nboth the antheridia and the peculiar organs, inside which the embryo or\r\nyoung fern is formed. Though the statements respecting the structure\r\nand development of these female organs and of the embryo were\r\ninaccurate in some important points, yet the place was now indicated\r\nwhere it might be presumed that the fertilisation by the spermatozoids\r\ntakes place; and as the history of the germination of the rest of\r\nthe vascular Cryptogams was to some extent known through the earlier\r\nlabours of Vaucher and Bischoff, the organs of fructification of these\r\nplants might now be sought, where they are really to be found. But\r\nan erroneous idea respecting the meaning of the small spores of the\r\nRhizocarps propounded by Schleiden had first to be put out of the way,\r\nand this was done by an appeal to the discovery of Nägeli mentioned\r\nabove and by the investigations of Mettenius. Then in 1849 Hofmeister\r\nsupplied a connected description of the germination of Pilularia\r\nand Salvinia, in which the decisive points as regards the sexual\r\nact were clearly set forth, and the connection of the spermatozoids\r\nwith the fertilisation of the egg-cells in the archegonium was\r\nestablished. He did the same for Selaginella, which is very unlike the\r\nRhizocarps and Ferns, and in which the spermatozoids are developed\r\nfrom smaller spores, and fertilise the egg-cells in archegonia formed\r\nin the prothallium of the large spores. By comparing the processes\r\nof germination in these plants with those of Ferns and Mosses, he\r\nsucceeded in throwing entirely new light on the whole of the morphology\r\nof these classes of plants, and thus made it possible for the first\r\ntime to compare them with one another and with the Phanerogams, and to\r\nform a right estimate of the sexual act in the Muscineae and Vascular\r\nCryptogams in its relation to the history of the development of these\r\nplants. Hofmeister arrived at the following conclusion from his\r\nobservations in 1849: ‘The prothallium in the vascular Cryptogams is\r\nthe morphological equivalent of the leaf-bearing Moss-plant, while the\r\nleafy plant of a Fern, of a Lycopodium and a Rhizocarp answers to the\r\ncapsule of the Moss. In Mosses as in Ferns there is an interruption\r\nof the vegetative development by sexual procreation, an alternation\r\nof generations; this takes place in the Vascular Cryptogams very soon\r\nafter germination, in the Mosses much later.’ The vast importance\r\nof this discovery to systematic botany has been already noticed.\r\nThe conception of these relations developed by Hofmeister was not\r\nless important to the doctrine of the sexuality of plants; it swept\r\naway at one stroke all the old false analogies between Phanerogams\r\nand Cryptogams and brought to light the real agreement; Hofmeister\r\nhad detected in the archegonium of the Cryptogams the body which is\r\ndeveloped there, as in the ovule of the Phanerogams, into an embryo\r\nafter fertilisation, namely the germinal vesicle or egg-cell. Here\r\nwas the point of departure for all further systematic comparison in\r\nthe sexual propagation of Cryptogams and Phanerogams. All beside was\r\nof secondary importance, even the fact, that the fertilisation of the\r\negg-cell in the Cryptogams is not effected by a pollen-tube, but by\r\nspermatozoids. It was now easy to show the corresponding relations of\r\ngeneration in the other cases which Hofmeister had not yet observed.\r\n\r\nHofmeister’s statements and conclusions respecting Selaginella and\r\nIsoetes were confirmed and some additions made to them by Mettenius in\r\n1850, and in 1851 appeared Hofmeister’s exhaustive work ‘Vergleichende\r\nUntersuchungen,’ in which the mode of production of the embryo in\r\nConiferae was represented as an intermediate form between those of\r\nPhanerogams and Cryptogams. Further contributions were made to the\r\nknowledge of the subject; Henfrey confirmed Hofmeister’s results in\r\nthe case of Ferns; Hofmeister himself and Milde observed in 1852 the\r\nhistory of fertilisation in Equisetaceae, and the former supplied at\r\nthe same time a more complete account of the development of Isoetes; in\r\n1855 he described the decisive points in Botrychium and Mettenius in\r\n1856 those in Ophioglossum.\r\n\r\nThe processes of development before and after fertilisation were\r\nnow cleared up by all these discoveries, but the direct observation\r\nof the act of fertilisation was still wanting. Hofmeister (‘Flora,’\r\n1857, p. 122) describes the state of affairs in the following terms:\r\n‘While numerous investigations had thrown a clear light on the\r\ncharacter of the male and female organs, and on the way in which the\r\nembryo is formed by repeated division of the egg-cell present before\r\nfertilisation, we continued quite in the dark respecting the particular\r\nnature of the fertilisation. Observation and experiment had established\r\nthe fact, that the influence of the spermatozoids on the archegonia was\r\nrequired to produce an embryo in the latter. Female moss-plants[115]\r\nseparated from the male, macrospores in the Vascular Cryptogams\r\nseparated from the microspores, had in all cases proved unproductive;\r\nbut it was not even certainly known to what point in the female organ\r\nthe spermatozoids force their way. It is true that Lesczyc and after\r\nhim Mercklin had seen the entry of moving spermatozoids into the mouth\r\nof archegonia in Ferns; but Lesczyc’s account of the part which he\r\nsupposed them to play there afterwards, was proved to be an illusion.\r\nI had myself observed motionless spermatozoids halfway down the neck\r\nof archegonia of an Equisetum; but nothing was to be learnt of the\r\nmanner in which the spermatozoid affects the egg-cell. Then it happened\r\nthat in the spring of 1851, being engaged in observing the development\r\nof the organs of vegetation of Ferns, I repeatedly saw spermatozoids\r\nmoving about in the basilar cells which enclose the egg-cell in the\r\narchegonia of Ferns, and the majority of them even playing about the\r\negg-cell. Their movements were put an end to during the observation\r\nby the commencement of changes, which the contents of young vegetable\r\ncells which have been cut open usually experience under the prolonged\r\ninfluence of water.’ Later observations leave no doubt now that in the\r\nMuscineae and Ferns single spermatozoids force their way into the naked\r\negg-cell of the archegonium.\r\n\r\nThe question was first set at rest in the Algae, where the process of\r\nfertilisation could be seen directly and without exposing the objects\r\nto destructive influences. That sexual propagation occurs in the Algae\r\nalso had seemed probable, since Decaisne and Thuret in 1845 discovered\r\norgans in species of Fucus, and Nägeli in 1846 in Florideae, which\r\nscarcely admitted of any other explanation. Alexander Braun also had\r\ncalled attention to the formation of two kinds of spores in a large\r\nnumber of fresh-water Algae. But as yet there was only conjecture. Then\r\nThuret proved by experiment in 1854, that in the genus Fucus the large\r\negg-cells must be fertilised by very small swarming spermatozoids, in\r\norder to set up germination; both organs can be collected separately\r\nand in numbers in this genus, and be brought together at pleasure;\r\nThuret even succeeded in obtaining hybrids. Pringsheim first observed\r\nin 1855 the formation of spermatozoids in the little horns of Vaucheria\r\nand established the fact that spores capable of germination are not\r\nformed unless the spermatozoids approach the egg-cell. To Thuret’s\r\nstatements he added the very important one, that the remains of\r\nspermatozoids may be recognised on the surface of the contents of\r\nthe fertilised egg-cell of Fucus, which is already surrounded by a\r\nmembrane. About the same time Cohn published his observations on\r\nSphaeroplea annulina, which confirmed the fact of the approach of\r\nthe spermatozoids to the egg-cells, which consequently, as in Fucus\r\nand Vaucheria, form a cell-wall and are rendered capable of further\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nStill the decisive observation had not yet been made; no one had\r\nyet seen how the two fertilising elements behaved at the moment of\r\nfertilisation. Pringsheim had the good fortune to make this observation\r\nin one of the commonest of fresh water Algae, Oedogonium. There he saw\r\nthe moving spermatozoid first come into contact with the protoplasmatic\r\nsubstance of the egg-cell, and then force its way into it, blend with\r\nit and dissolve. And thus the first observation was made, which proved\r\ndecisively that a real intermixture takes place of the male and female\r\nelements of fertilisation; this important fact was confirmed by De Bary\r\nin the same year.\r\n\r\nNow that it was once established, that fertilisation in Cryptogams\r\nconsists in the blending together of two naked bodies of protoplasm,\r\nthe spermatozoid and the egg-cell, it was reasonable to conclude that\r\nconjugation in Spirogyra and generally in Conjugatae, was an act of\r\nfertilisation, only in this case the two fertilisation-elements are\r\nnot of different size and shape, but similar in appearance. To this\r\nconclusion De Bary arrived in 1858 in his monograph of the Conjugatae.\r\nThis extension of the idea of fertilisation to cases in which the\r\nuniting cells are to outward appearance alike, was of special value\r\nto the theory of sexuality, as was seen in the sequel, when other\r\nforms of fertilisation were observed which made it necessary still\r\nfurther to extend the idea of sexuality. In 1858 Pringsheim discovered\r\narrangements for fertilisation in another group of Algae, the\r\nSaprolegnieae, which to outward appearance at least departed widely\r\nfrom those hitherto known in the lower plants.\r\n\r\nThus between the years 1850 and 1860 a number of fundamental facts\r\nwere discovered, and were afterwards confirmed and extended by fresh\r\nobservations in the course of the following years. It does not fall\r\nwithin the limits of this work to notice the many discoveries that\r\nwere made in this part of botanical science after 1860; we will only\r\nremark, that between 1860 and 1870 the processes of fructification were\r\nobserved by Thuret and Bornet in Florideae, and especially by De Bary\r\nand his pupils in Fungi, in some of which very peculiar forms were\r\nbrought to light. No doubt any longer exists that difference of sex\r\nprevails generally in the Thallophytes also, though it is still an open\r\nquestion, whether it may not be wanting in some of the very simplest\r\nand smallest kinds.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important results of these investigations is\r\nobviously the striking resemblance between many of the processes of\r\nfertilisation in Cryptogams and in the lower animals; here is another\r\nconfirmation of the fact, often brought out in other ways by modern\r\nzoological and botanical research, that the points of resemblance in\r\nthe vegetable and animal kingdoms appear most plainly, if we compare\r\ntogether the simplest forms to be found in both; we have in this\r\nfact a plain proof also, that both kingdoms have been developed from\r\nlike common elements, as the theory of descent implies. With respect\r\nto the true nature of fertilisation itself, which is evidently a\r\nsimilar process in the main in animals and plants, we can only say at\r\npresent, that it amounts in all cases to a material blending together\r\nof the contents of two cells, neither of which is capable of further\r\ndevelopment by itself, while the product of the combination is not only\r\ncapable of such development, but unites in itself the characteristics\r\nof the two parent forms and transmits them to its descendants. That\r\nfertilisation is not the intimate union of two bodies possessing a\r\ndefinite form, but that the male fertilising substance at least may\r\nbe a simple fluid, appears to be distinctly shown by the process in\r\nPhanerogams; and we may assume, that in Cryptogams also, the sexual act\r\nis not affected by the form of the fertilisation-elements, though a\r\ncertain shape and power of movement is necessary for the conveyance of\r\nthe fertilising substance to that which is to be fertilised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n           HISTORY OF THE THEORY OF THE NUTRITION OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n                              1583-1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat plants take up certain substances from their environment for the\r\npurpose of building up their own structures could not be a matter of\r\ndoubt even in the earliest times; it was also obvious, that movements\r\nof the nutrient material must be connected with this proceeding. But it\r\nwas not so easy to say, what was the nature of this food of plants, in\r\nwhat manner it finds its way into and is distributed in them, and what\r\nare the forces employed; it was even for a long time undecided, whether\r\nthe food taken up from without suffers any change inside the plant,\r\nbefore it is applied to purposes of growth. Such were the questions\r\nwhich had engaged the attention of Aristotle, and which formed the\r\nchief subject of Cesalpino’s physiological meditations.\r\n\r\nBut the questions respecting the nutrition of plants acquired a much\r\nmore definite shape in the latter half of the 17th century, when the\r\nvarious phenomena of vegetation began to be more closely observed, and\r\nsome attempt was made to understand their relations to the outer world.\r\nMalpighi, the founder of phytotomy, was the first who undertook to\r\nexplain the share which belongs to the different organs of the plant\r\nin the whole work of nutrition; guided by analogy, he perceived that\r\nthe green leaves are the organs which prepare the food, and that the\r\nmaterial so prepared by them passes into all parts of the plant, there\r\nto be stored up or employed for purposes of growth. But this gave no\r\ninsight into the nature of the substances from which plants prepare\r\ntheir food. On this point Mariotte endeavoured to give such information\r\nas could be obtained from the chemistry of his day; and he has the\r\nmerit of having shown, in opposition to the old Aristotelian notion,\r\nthat plants convert the food-material which they derive from the ground\r\ninto new chemical combinations, while the earth and the water supply\r\nthe same elements of nutrition to the most different kinds of plants.\r\nIt could not escape the notice of physiologists even of that time,\r\nthat the water which plants take up from the ground introduces into\r\nthem but very small quantities of matter in solution. Van Helmont in\r\nthe first half of the 17th century had shown this by an experiment,\r\nthe results of which, however, led him to think that plants were able\r\nto produce both the combustible and incombustible parts of their\r\nsubstance from water. Hales at the beginning of the 18th century formed\r\na different opinion, being led by the evolution of the gases in the dry\r\ndistillation of plants to conclude, that a considerable part of their\r\nsubstance was absorbed in a gaseous form from the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe views propounded by Malpighi, Mariotte, and Hales contained the\r\nmost important elements of a theory of the nutrition of plants; fully\r\nunderstood they would have taught that one part of the food of plants\r\ncomes from the earth and the water, and another part from the air;\r\nthat the leaves change the materials thus obtained in such a manner as\r\nto produce from them the substance of plants and to apply this to the\r\npurposes of growth; but the ideas were not combined in this way, for\r\nduring some years after their time botanists were chiefly engaged in\r\nobservations on the movement of the sap in plants, and they arrived\r\neven on this point at very obscure and even contradictory results,\r\nbecause they overlooked the function of the leaves which had already\r\nbeen recognised by Malpighi. All insight not only into the chemical\r\nprocesses in the nutrition of plants, but also into the mechanical laws\r\nof the movement of the sap, and generally into the whole internal\r\neconomy of plants, depends on a knowledge of the fact, that it is only\r\nthe cells which contain chlorophyll, and therefore in the higher plants\r\nthe leaves chiefly as consisting largely of such cells, which have the\r\npower of converting the gaseous food supplied by the atmosphere into\r\nthe substance of the plant with the aid of the materials taken up from\r\nthe soil. This fact is of fundamental importance to the whole theory of\r\nthe nutrition of plants; it is only by a knowledge of it that we can\r\nexplain the movement of material connected with nutrition and growth,\r\nthe dependence of vegetation on light, and to a great extent also the\r\nfunction of the roots.\r\n\r\nBut this principle could not be discovered till the new chemical\r\nsystem founded by Lavoisier took the place of the old phlogistic\r\nchemistry, and it is remarkable that the discoveries, which laid the\r\nfoundation of modern chemistry in the period between 1760 and 1780,\r\ncontributed essentially to the establishment at the same time of the\r\nmodern doctrine of the nutrition of plants. Ingen-Houss, in reliance\r\non Lavoisier’s antiphlogistic views on the composition of air, water,\r\nand the mineral acids, succeeded in proving that all parts of plants\r\nare continually absorbing oxygen and forming carbon dioxide, but that\r\nthe green organs at the same time under the influence of light absorb\r\ncarbon dioxide and exhale oxygen; and as early as 1796 he considered\r\nit probable that plants obtain the whole mass of their carbon from\r\nthe carbon dioxide of the atmosphere. Soon after (1804) de Saussure\r\nproved, that plants, while they decompose carbon dioxide, increase in\r\nweight by a greater amount than that of the carbon which they retain,\r\nand that this is to be explained by the fact that they at the same\r\ntime fix the elements of water. He likewise showed that the small\r\nquantities of saline compounds, which plants take up from the soil, are\r\na necessary part of their food, and that it was at least probable, that\r\nthe nitrogen of the atmosphere does not contribute to the formation of\r\nnitrogenous substances in plants. Senebier had before insisted on the\r\nfact, that the decomposition of carbon dioxide under the influence of\r\nlight only takes place in green organs.\r\n\r\nThus the most important points in the nutrition of plants were\r\ndiscovered by Ingen-Houss, Senebier and de Saussure. But, as often\r\nhappens in the case of discoveries of such magnitude, their ideas\r\nwere for a long time exposed to great misunderstanding. They were\r\nbetter appreciated in France than in any other country; Dutrochet and\r\nDe Candolle were able to see the importance of the interchange of\r\ngases in the green organs to the general nutrition and respiration;\r\nbut others, and especially German botanists, were not content with\r\nthese simple chemical processes as the foundation of the whole system\r\nof nutrition and consequently of the whole life of the plant; the\r\ntheory of the vital force, which was elaborated in connection with the\r\nnature-philosophy during the first years of the 19th century, and was\r\ngenerally accepted by philosophers and physiologists, chemists and\r\nphysicists, preferred to supply the plant with a mysterious substance\r\nfor its food, which had its source in the life itself and which it\r\ncalled humus. The most obvious considerations, which must at once have\r\nshown that this humus-theory was absurd, were entirely overlooked;\r\nand thus in the face of de Saussure’s results the food of plants was\r\nonce more referred entirely to the soil and the roots, as it was in\r\nthe earliest times; one of the consequences of this humus-theory in\r\ncombination with the vital force was that the ash-constituents of\r\nplants were supposed to be merely accidental admixtures or stimulants,\r\nor to be directly produced in the plant by the vital force.\r\n\r\nIn the period between 1820 and 1840 the reaction set in from different\r\nquarters against the theory of vital force; chemists succeeded in\r\nproducing by artificial means certain organic compounds, which had\r\nhitherto been regarded as products of that force; Dutrochet discovered\r\nin endosmose a process, which served to refer various vital phenomena\r\nin plants to physico-mechanical principles; de Saussure and others\r\nshowed that the heat of plants is a product of respiration, and by\r\n1840 the earlier theory of a vital force might be looked upon as\r\nantiquated and obsolete. It remained to restore to their rights the\r\nobservations of Ingen-Houss and de Saussure, which under the influence\r\nof that theory and of the notions respecting the humus had been so\r\nutterly misconstrued. Liebig set aside the humus-theory in 1840,\r\nand referred the carbon of plants entirely to the carbon dioxide\r\nof the atmosphere, and their nitrogenous contents to ammonia and\r\nits derivatives; he claimed the components of the ash as essential\r\nfactors in the nutrition, and taking his stand on the general laws of\r\nchemistry endeavoured to obtain chiefly by the method of deduction an\r\ninsight into the chemical processes of assimilation and metabolism.\r\nThe whole theoretical value of the facts discovered by Ingen-Houss,\r\nSenebier and de Saussure was first made apparent by the connection\r\nwhich Liebig succeeded in establishing between the phenomena of\r\nnutrition. The doctrine of nutrition burst suddenly into new life;\r\nfirm ground was gained, and the botanist, no longer distracted by\r\nthe difficulties raised by the vital force but resting on physical\r\nand chemical principles, might now resume the task of investigation.\r\nOxygen-respiration denied by Liebig was first of all re-established\r\nby von Mohl and others. Liebig’s views on the source of nitrogen in\r\nplants and on the importance of the ash-constituents rested chiefly on\r\ngeneral considerations and observations and on calculation, and had now\r\nto be tested by systematic investigation and especially by experiments\r\non vegetation in individual plants. And here the place of honour must\r\nbe assigned to Boussingault, who pursued the path of pure induction\r\nas contrasted with Liebig’s deductive mode of proceeding, gradually\r\nimproved the methods for experimenting on vegetation, and soon\r\nsucceeded in so producing plants in a purely mineral soil free from all\r\nhumus, that he finally settled the question of the derivation of the\r\ncarbon from the atmosphere and of the source of the nitrogen also.\r\nHe showed from the plants thus artificially nourished, and with due\r\nconsideration of the many sources of error which beset the question,\r\nthat the uncombined nitrogen of the atmosphere does not contribute to\r\nthe nutrition of plants, but that a normal increase in the nitrogenous\r\nsubstances in a plant takes place when the roots take up nitrates as\r\nwell as the necessary constituents of the ash.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of some doubts which still remained respecting the\r\nnecessity of certain constituents of the ash, such as sodium, chlorine\r\nand silicic acid, the source of the materials which take a part in\r\nthe chemistry of the nutrition of plants was known before 1860; but\r\nthe knowledge obtained with regard to processes in the interior of\r\nthe plant, the origination of organic substances in the processes of\r\nassimilation, and the further changes which they undergo was still\r\nfragmentary and uncertain, and led to no general and conclusive results.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. CESALPINO.\r\n\r\nAristotle had sought to determine the nature of the materials which\r\nplants take up as food, and had laid down the proposition, that the\r\nfood of all organisms is not simple but composed of various substances.\r\nThis view was correct, but he united with it the erroneous notion,\r\nthat the food of plants is elaborated beforehand in the earth, as in a\r\nstomach, and is made applicable to purposes of growth, so as to exclude\r\nthe necessity of any separation of excrements in the plant; this error\r\nwas refuted by Jung, as we shall see, but nevertheless it continued to\r\nlive as late as into the 18th century, and ultimately quite spoilt Du\r\nHamel’s theory of nutrition.\r\n\r\nCesalpino, whom we have learnt to regard as a faithful and gifted\r\ndisciple of Aristotle, directed his speculations to the mechanical\r\nrather than to the chemical side of the question, and chiefly tried to\r\nexplain the movement of the nutrient sap in plants. He had a larger\r\nstock of material drawn from experience at his disposition than his\r\nmaster, and it is instructive therefore to make a nearer acquaintance\r\nwith his views, because they show how far the old philosophy was in a\r\ncondition to turn better empirical knowledge than Aristotle possessed\r\nto a satisfactory use; they will also show that Cesalpino’s first\r\nessays led him to views which can no longer be said to be strictly\r\nAristotelian.\r\n\r\nIn the second chapter of the first book of the work from which we have\r\nalready quoted, ‘De plantis libri XVI,’ 1583, he raises the question,\r\nin what way the food of plants is taken in and their nutrition\r\naccomplished. In animals we see the food conveyed from the veins to the\r\nheart, which is the laboratory of the warmth of the body, and after it\r\nhas been finally perfected there, spread abroad through the arteries\r\ninto all parts of the body; and this is effected by the operation of\r\nthe force (spiritus) which is generated in the heart from the food.\r\nIn plants on the contrary we see no veins, or other channels, nor do\r\nwe feel any warmth in them, so that it is difficult to understand\r\nhow trees grow to so great a size, since they seem to have much less\r\nnatural heat than animals. Cesalpino explains this enigma by saying,\r\nthat animals require much food for maintaining the activity of the\r\nsenses and the movements of their organs. The larger quantity of animal\r\nfood also requires larger receptacles, namely the veins. Plants on the\r\nother hand need less food, because this is only used for purposes of\r\nnutrition, or to a very small extent for the production of internal\r\nheat as well, and therefore they grow more vigorously and bear more\r\nfruit than animals. At the same time plants are not without internal\r\nheat, though it cannot be perceived by the touch because all objects\r\nseem cold to us, which are less warm than our organ of feeling. That\r\nplants moreover have veins, though only narrow ones in accordance with\r\nthe small mass of their food, is shown by those which yield a milky\r\njuice, such as Euphorbia and Ficus, which when cut bleed like the\r\nflesh of animals; Cesalpino adds ‘and this is very frequent also in\r\nthe vine,’ which shows that he made no distinction between milky juice\r\nand the exuding water of the weeping vine-stock. These narrow veins\r\ncannot be seen on account of their fineness; but in every stem and in\r\nevery root things may be discerned which like nerves in animals can be\r\nsplit longitudinally and are called the nerves of the plant, or also\r\ncertain thicker things, such as those which branch in most leaves and\r\nare there called veins. These should be considered as food-passages\r\nand as answering to the veins in animals; but plants have no main vein\r\nlike the vena cava in animals, but many fine veins pass from the root\r\nto the heart of the plant (cor, root-neck, see above, Book I. chap. 2),\r\nand ascend from it into the stem; for it was not necessary that the\r\nfood should be collected in a common receptacle in plants, as it is in\r\nthe heart in animals, where this is necessary for the production of\r\nthe spiritus, but it was sufficient that the fluid in plants should be\r\nchanged by contact with the medulla cordis (in the root-neck), as it is\r\nchanged in animals in the marrow of the brain or in the liver; and in\r\nthese organs the veins are very narrow, as they are in plants.\r\n\r\nSince plants have no sense-perception, they cannot seek their food\r\nlike animals, but they draw up the moisture from the ground into\r\nthemselves in a way of their own; but it is not easy to see how this\r\ntakes place. Cesalpino, in trying to explain this, gives us a glimpse\r\ninto the physics of the day, and we observe also to our surprise an\r\nattempt made to explain phenomena in living creatures by physical\r\nlaws, a step beyond the limits of Aristotelian modes of thought and in\r\nthe right direction. It is not the ratio similitudinis, which draws\r\niron to the magnet, that can cause the attraction of the juice by the\r\nroots, for then the smaller would be drawn to the larger; and if the\r\nattraction of the fluid of the earth by the roots were the same thing\r\nas the attraction of the iron by the magnet, the moisture of the earth\r\nwould draw out the juice from the plant, which is just what does not\r\nhappen. Nor can it be the ratio vacui; for since not moisture only\r\nbut air also is contained in the earth, the plant would be filled not\r\nwith juice but with air. But Cesalpino hits upon a third kind of cause\r\nby which juices may be drawn into the plant. Do not many dry things,\r\nhe says, in accordance with their nature attract moisture, as linen,\r\nsponge and powder, while others repel it, as the feathers of many birds\r\nand the herb Adiantum, which are not wetted even when dipped in water;\r\nbut the former absorb much water, because they have more in common with\r\nit than with air; of this kind Cesalpino thinks those parts of plants\r\nmust be, which the nourishing soul employs to take in food. Therefore\r\nthese organs are not traversed by a continuous canal such as the veins\r\nin animals, but formed like the nerves of a fibrous substance; and thus\r\nthe power of suction (bibula natura) conveys the moisture continually\r\nto the place, where the principle of internal heat is placed, just as\r\nmay be seen in the flame of a lantern, to which the wick continually\r\nconducts the oil. The absorption of the moisture is also increased\r\nby the outer warmth, for which reason plants grow more vigorously in\r\nspring and summer.\r\n\r\nThat Cesalpino had no suspicion of the use of the leaves in the\r\nnutrition of plants appears incontestably from his repeating the\r\nAristotelian idea, that the leaves are only for the protection of young\r\nshoots and fruits from air and sun-light; this idea is no result of\r\nspeculation, but came simply from observing a vineyard in a hot country.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. FIRST INDUCTIVE EXPERIMENTS AND OPENING OF NEW POINTS OF VIEW IN THE\r\nHISTORY OF THE THEORY OF THE NUTRITION OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\nAll that Aristotle and his school, Cesalpino not excepted, are able to\r\ntell us about the phenomena of vegetable life, was the result of the\r\nmost every-day observations, none of which were critically and exactly\r\ntested to ascertain their actual correctness, while the larger part\r\nof their physiological axioms were not derived from observations on\r\nplants at all, but from philosophical principles, and especially from\r\nanalogies taken from the animal world.\r\n\r\nThe first step towards a scientific treatment of the doctrine of\r\nnutrition was an enlargement and critical examination of the materials\r\nto be gained from experience; nor were any difficult observations or\r\nexperiments needed to discover contradictions between the truths of\r\nnature and the old philosophy; all that was necessary was to look into\r\nthings more closely and to judge of them with less prejudice.\r\n\r\nIn this way Jung was led to oppose one important point of the\r\nAristotelian account of nutrition. In the second fragment of his work\r\n‘De plantis doxoscopiae physicae minores’ is to be found a remark,\r\nwhich is evidently directed against the notion that plants receive\r\ntheir food already elaborated from the earth, and therefore give\r\noff no excrements[116]. Plants, says Jung in accord with Aristotle,\r\nappear not to need a thinking soul (anima intelligente), which would\r\nbe able to distinguish wholesome from unwholesome food, and Aristotle\r\ntherefore provided them with food which had already been perfectly\r\nprepared in the earth. But Jung takes another view founded on actual\r\nobservation. It is very possible, he says, that the openings in the\r\nroots which take in liquid matter are so organised, that they do not\r\nallow every kind of juice to enter, and who can say that plants have\r\nthe peculiarity of only absorbing what is useful to them, for like\r\nall other living creatures they have their excreta, which are exhaled\r\nthrough the leaves, flowers, and fruits. But among these he reckons the\r\nresins and other exuding liquids, and says that it is possible after\r\nall that a large part of the juices of plants escapes by imperceptible\r\nevaporation, as happens in animals.\r\n\r\nAccording to Aristotle’s view the plant itself was quite passive in\r\nthe work of nutrition; since food was offered to it which had been\r\nalready prepared for it in the earth, growth was to some extent merely\r\na process of crystallisation unaccompanied by chemical change. In\r\npointing to the formation of excreta Jung on the contrary ascribed a\r\nchemical activity to the plant, and by supposing that the organisation\r\nof the root was such as to prevent the entrance of certain matters\r\nand to favour that of others, he made the plant co-operate in its own\r\nnourishment, though he did not assume that it needed a thinking soul\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\nJohann Baptist van Helmont[117], physician and chemist, and a\r\ncontemporary of Jung, took up a position still more decidedly opposed\r\nto Aristotelian doctrines. He rejected the four elements of that\r\nphilosophy, and regarding water as a chief constituent of all things\r\nhe considered that the whole substance of plants, the mineral parts\r\n(the ash) as well as the combustible, was formed from water. Thus while\r\nAristotle made the component parts of plants be introduced into them by\r\nwater in a state ready for use, Van Helmont, on the contrary, ascribed\r\nto the plant the power of producing all kinds of material from water.\r\nIt would scarcely have been necessary to mention this resistance to old\r\ndogmas, originating as it did in the notions of the alchemists, if Van\r\nHelmont had not made an attempt to establish his views by experiment;\r\nthis was the first experiment in vegetation undertaken for a scientific\r\npurpose of which we have any information, and it was repeatedly\r\nquoted by many later physiologists, and employed in support of their\r\ntheories. He placed in a pot a certain quantity of earth, which when\r\nhighly dried weighed two hundred pounds; a willow-branch weighing five\r\npounds was set in this pot, which was protected by a cover from dust,\r\nand daily watered with rain-water. In five years’ time the willow had\r\ngrown to be large and strong, and had increased in weight by a hundred\r\nand sixty-four pounds, though the earth in the pot, when once more\r\ndried, only showed a loss of two ounces. Van Helmont concluded from\r\nthis experiment that the considerable increase of weight in the plant\r\nhad been gained entirely at the cost of the water, and consequently\r\nthat all the materials in the plant, though distinct from water,\r\nnevertheless come from it.\r\n\r\nThese objections to Aristotelian teaching on the part of Jung and Van\r\nHelmont remained isolated and unproductive, but an incentive to new\r\ninvestigations in vegetable physiology was supplied from a different\r\nquarter, and its influence lasted till far into the 18th century. This\r\nwas the suggestion, that not only does a nutrient sap taken up by\r\nthe roots ascend to the leaves and fruits of plants, but that there\r\nis also a movement of the same sap in the opposite direction in the\r\nrind. But this idea assumed from the first two different forms. Some\r\nbotanists, evidently resting on the analogy of the circulation of the\r\nblood in animals, supposed that there was also an actual circulation of\r\nthe sap in plants; others on the contrary were content with supposing\r\nthat while the watery sap absorbed by the roots rises in the wood, an\r\nelaborated sap capable of ministering to growth moves in the rind, the\r\nlaticiferous vessels, and the resin-ducts. The two views were at a\r\nlater time repeatedly confounded together, and those who refuted the\r\nfirst believed that they had refuted the other also. It appears that a\r\nphysician from Breslau, Johann Daniel Major[118], Professor in Kiel,\r\nfirst gave expression to the opinion, that there is a circulation of\r\nthe nourishing substance in plants as in animals; and from this time\r\nto the end of the 18th century the circulation of the juices of plants\r\nwas a favourite subject of discussion, but more often chosen by the\r\nimpugners of the doctrine than by its defenders.\r\n\r\nThe better form of the idea, namely, that there is a return-movement\r\nof material towards the root, combined with the view, that the leaves\r\nare the organs which produce the substances required for growth from\r\nthe crude material supplied to them, was expressed by Malpighi as early\r\nas 1771 in the shape of a well-considered theory. In his ‘Anatomes\r\nplantarum idea’ of that year he devotes the last pages to a short\r\naccount of the theory of nutrition, as he understood it. He regarded\r\nthe fibrous constituents of the wood as the organs for conducting the\r\nsap taken up by the roots, and the vessels as air-passages, which he\r\nnamed tracheae on account of their resemblance to the tracheae of\r\ninsects. He was in doubt whether the air came from the earth through\r\nthe roots, or from the atmosphere through the leaves, for he had\r\nnever succeeded in finding openings for the entrance of air in the\r\nroots or the leaves; but he thought it more probable that the air is\r\nabsorbed by the roots, because they are well supplied with tracheae,\r\nand air has besides a tendency to ascend. Beside these fluid-conducting\r\nfibres and air-conducting tracheae in the wood he called attention\r\nto the existence of special vessels, which conduct peculiar juices\r\nin many plants, as the laticiferous vessels, gum-passages, and\r\nturpentine-canals.\r\n\r\nRespecting the movement of the juices, he notices that the direction\r\nmay be reversed, because shoots planted upside down send out roots\r\ninto the earth from what is organically their upper end, and grow into\r\ntrees; and though they do not grow vigorously, yet the experiment\r\nproves that the movement of the sap in them is in the reverse\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nAfter these preliminary remarks he proceeds to prove, that it is in\r\nthe leaves that the crude juices of nutrition undergo the change which\r\nfits them for the maintenance of growth. The way in which Malpighi\r\narrives at this view is as simple as it is original. He considers\r\nthe cotyledons of young plants to be genuine leaves (in leguminibus\r\nseminalis caro, quae folium est conglobatum), as is shown in the\r\ngourd, where the cotyledons grow into large green leaves. Liquid is\r\nconveyed to them through the radicle, and a portion of the substances\r\nwhich they contain passes from them into the plumule to make it grow,\r\nwhich it will not do if the cotyledons are removed; hence he concludes\r\nthat all other leaves also are intended to elaborate (excoquere) the\r\nnutritive juice contained in their cells, which the woody fibres have\r\nconveyed to them. The liquids mingled together in their long passage\r\nthrough the network of fibres are changed in the leaves by the power\r\nof the sun’s rays, and blended with the sap before contained in their\r\ncells, and thus a new combination of the constituent parts is effected,\r\ntranspiration proceeding at the same time; he compares the whole\r\nprocess with that which goes on in the blood of animals.\r\n\r\nWe see that Malpighi’s view of the function of the leaves in nutrition\r\napproaches very closely to the truth, as closely indeed as was at\r\nall possible in the existing condition of chemical knowledge. He was\r\ninduced by the results of anatomical investigation to carry this view\r\nfarther and indeed correctly; he supposed that the parenchymatous\r\ntissue of the rind acts in the same way as the leaves; but he went a\r\nstep too far in assigning the function of the leaves to the colourless\r\nparenchyma also, which only serves for the storing up of assimilated\r\nmatter. He says we must ascribe a character similar to that of the\r\nleaf-cells to the corresponding cells in the rind and to those also\r\nwhich lie transversely in the wood (the medullary and cortical rays),\r\nand that it is not unreasonable to conclude that the food of the plant\r\nis elaborated and stored up in these cells. As he makes no sharp\r\ndistinction between elaboration and mere storing up, he ascribes the\r\nfunction of the leaves to the parenchyma of fleshy fruits also and to\r\nthe scales of bulbs; he concludes from the exudations from stumps of\r\ntrees and from the cut surfaces of other parts of plants, that they are\r\nfilled with reserve-matter (asservato humore turgent).\r\n\r\nThus the essential points in Malpighi’s theory of nutrition in the year\r\n1671 were, that the vessels of the wood are primarily air-conducting\r\norgans, that the leaves elaborate the crude sap for purposes of\r\ngrowth, that the sap so elaborated is stored up in different parts of\r\nthe plant, and that the fibrous elements of the wood convey upwards\r\nto the leaves the crude materials of nutrition which are absorbed by\r\nthe roots. No mention is made of a circulation of juices, comparable\r\nto the circulation of the blood, though this idea was in later times\r\noften imputed to him; and we find by his later remarks, that while he\r\nwas in no doubt as to the elementary organs which convey the ascending\r\nsap, he confined himself to conjecture with respect to the way by\r\nwhich the sap elaborated in the cell-tissue of the leaves, rind and\r\nparenchyma generally is carried on its further course. But he was in\r\nno doubt about the direction of that course; he believed that this sap\r\nforces itself downwards through the stem into the roots, and upwards\r\nin the branches above the leaves and so into the fruit. Thus Malpighi\r\nhad formed a more correct idea of the movement of assimilated matter\r\nthan the majority of his successors who introduced the very unsuitable\r\nexpression, ‘descending sap.’ He further thought it probable that the\r\nelaborated sap passes through the bast-bundles[119], but without a\r\ncontinuous flux and reflux (absque perenni et considerabili fluxu et\r\nrefluxu); that it rests to some extent in the laticiferous vessels,\r\nbut that it is also driven sometimes, when occasion requires, by\r\ntranspiration and external causes into the higher parts of the plant,\r\nwhere it is the means of maintaining growth and nutrition. These later\r\nremarks also are better than much that was said about the movement of\r\nthe sap in the 18th and even in the 19th century, and at all events\r\nthey prove that to speak of Malpighi as a defender of the circulation\r\nof the sap in Major’s sense, as was often done in later times, was an\r\nentire misunderstanding of his views.\r\n\r\nMalpighi published his theory in a brief and connected form in 1671; it\r\nappeared again further worked out in detail in the fuller edition of\r\nthe Phytotomy in 1674; he attributed a special value to his discovery,\r\nthat plants require air to breathe as much as animals, and that the\r\nvessels of the wood answer in function to the tracheae in insects and\r\nto the lungs in other animals; he recurs also several times to the\r\nimportance of leaves as organs for the elaboration of the food.\r\n\r\nIf we compare Malpighi’s theory of the nutrition of plants with the\r\nviews of his predecessors, we cannot help seeing, that it was an\r\nentirely new creation, in which Aristotelian doctrines had no share.\r\nIf his successors had apprehended the important and essential points\r\nin his doctrine and had striven by experimenting on living plants\r\nto support and illustrate them by new facts, we should have been\r\nspared many erroneous notions which established themselves in the\r\ntheory, and made it a perfect chaos of misconceptions. That particular\r\nmisconception, which we have already mentioned more than once,\r\nnamely, that Malpighi, like Major and Perrault after him, assumed a\r\ncontinuous circulation of the juices of the plant, necessarily involved\r\nan incorrect idea of the function of the leaves; that function was\r\nby many later writers either quite neglected, or sought for chiefly\r\nin transpiration, the chemical activity of the leaves being quite\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nMalpighi’s theory can hardly be said to take into consideration the\r\nchemical nature of the food of plants; it is chiefly occupied with the\r\nrelation of the organs to the main points in the nutritive process;\r\nits foundations are for the most part laid in the anatomy of the\r\nplant. Grew, who in all essential points adopted Malpighi’s views,\r\nbut without doing much to advance them by his lengthy discussions on\r\nparticular questions, made some attempt to extend the knowledge of\r\nthe chemistry of the subject; but his notions were entirely borrowed\r\nfrom the corpuscular theory of Descartes, and he may be said to have\r\nconstructed his own chemical processes; the consequence was that he\r\nusually overlooked the points that were of fundamental importance, and\r\nbrought nothing to light that could assist the further development of\r\nthe theory of nutrition. But there is another writer, whose name is in\r\nthe present day known to few in the history of vegetable physiology,\r\nbut whose ideas on the chemistry of plants are of great interest. This\r\nwriter is MARIOTTE[120], the discoverer of the well-known law of gases,\r\none of the greatest physicists of the latter half of the 17th century,\r\nwho also enriched the physiology of the human body with some valuable\r\ndiscoveries. We have a tolerably copious treatise of Mariotte’s in the\r\nform of a letter to a M. Lantin in the year 1679, to be found in the\r\n‘Œuvres de Mariotte,’ Leyden, 1717, under the title, ‘Sur le sujet\r\ndes plantes.’ It is highly instructive to gather from this letter the\r\nideas of one of the most famous and ablest of the natural philosophers\r\nof that day on chemical processes and conditions in the nutrition of\r\nplants, a few years after the appearance of Malpighi’s great work and\r\nabout the time that Grew’s Phytotomy was being published. It is to be\r\nexpected that Mariotte should give but an incidental and superficial\r\nattention to the more delicate structure of plants; but we are\r\ncompensated for this by his making us acquainted with everything\r\nfundamentally important and new which could at that time be said on\r\nthe chemistry of the food of plants. Speaking of the ‘elements’ or\r\n‘principles’ of plants, Mariotte propounds three hypotheses. The first\r\nis, that there are many immediate principles (principes grossiers et\r\nvisibles, evidently what we should call proximate constituents) in\r\nplants, such as water, sulphur or oil, common salt, nitre, volatile\r\nsalt or ammonia, certain earths, etc.; and that each of these immediate\r\nconstituents is a compound of three or four more simple principles,\r\nwhich have united together into one body; nitre for instance has its\r\n‘phlegma’ or tasteless water, its ‘spiritus,’ its fixed salt, and other\r\nthings; common salt in the same way has the like constituents, and it\r\nmay be assumed with much probability, that these more simple principles\r\nalso are compounds of parts that differ among themselves, but are too\r\nsmall to be distinguished by any artificial means as to figure or any\r\nother characters. Having shown how certain principles unite together,\r\nhe goes on to say, that he is unwilling to ascribe to them any sort\r\nof consciousness (connaissance) by which they seek to unite together;\r\nbut he thinks that they are endowed with a natural disposition to\r\nmove towards one another, and to unite closely as soon as they touch\r\none another; though it is very difficult to define the nature of this\r\ndisposition, it is enough to know that there are many instances of such\r\nmovements to be found in nature; thus heavy bodies move towards the\r\ncentre of the earth, and iron to the magnet; nor are these movements\r\nmore difficult to conceive, than that of the planets in their courses\r\nor of the sun round its axis, or that of the heart in a living animal.\r\nWith this first hypothesis Mariotte places himself, in opposition to\r\nthe Aristotelian doctrine with its entelechies and final causes which\r\nprevailed at that time among botanists and physiologists, upon the\r\nfirm ground of modern science with its atoms, and its assumption of\r\nnecessarily active forces of attraction.\r\n\r\nMariotte’s second hypothesis more specially concerns the chemical\r\nnature of plants; he supposes that several of his principes grossiers\r\nare contained in every plant, and he endeavours first to explain their\r\nsource; the motes in the air, he says, which when burnt by lightning\r\nsmell of sulphur, are carried by rain into the earth, and parts of\r\nthem are taken up into the plant. Moreover distillation in all plants\r\nproduces a water, which the chemists call phlegma, and also acids and\r\nammonia, and if the residuum is burnt there remains an ash, from which\r\nwe obtain an earth which is without taste and insoluble in water,\r\nand fixed salts; these salts differ from one another according as\r\nthey are mixed with more or less acid and ammoniacal spirit or other\r\nunknown principles, which the fire could not volatilise. It is not to\r\nbe wondered at that these principles are found in plants, since they\r\nderive their food from the earth which contains them. We see how great\r\nhas been the advance since the time when Van Helmont believed that he\r\nhad proved by his experiment, that all the materials in plants come\r\nfrom pure water.\r\n\r\nIt remained to confront one view of the source of the substances in\r\nplants, which was also drawn from the treasure-house of Aristotelian\r\nconceptions, and was still in vogue. It was supposed that the very\r\nmaterials of which the plant is composed were contained in their own\r\nform in the earth, and had only to be taken up by the roots. Aristotle\r\nhad himself said: ‘Everything feeds on that of which it consists, and\r\neverything feeds on more than one thing; whatever appears to feed only\r\non one thing, as the plant on water, feeds on more than one thing, for\r\nearth in the case of the plant is mixed with the water; therefore the\r\ncountry-people water plants with mixtures of things.’ This passage\r\nmight leave some doubt about Aristotle’s view, if we did not find the\r\nfollowing: ‘As many savours as there are in the rinds of fruits, so\r\nmany it is plain prevail also in the earth. Therefore also many of\r\nthe old philosophers said, that the water is of as many kinds as the\r\nground through which it runs[121].’ These passages taken with those\r\nquoted above show that Aristotle made the substances required for the\r\ngrowth of plants reach them from the earth ready elaborated, as has\r\nbeen before observed; and this view, still maintained in Mariotte’s\r\ntime, may yet be met with among those who are ignorant of physiology.\r\nIt is interesting then to see, how vigorously Mariotte exposes the\r\nincorrectness and absurdity of this idea, though he has no new\r\ndiscovery to help him. In his third hypothesis he maintains, that\r\nthe salts, earths, oils, and other things, which different species\r\nof plants yield by distillation, are always the same, and that the\r\ndifferences are due entirely to the way in which these principes\r\ngrossiers and their simplest parts are united together or separated,\r\nand he proves it thus: If a bonchretien pear is grafted on a wild one,\r\nthe same sap, which in the wild plant produces indifferent pears,\r\nproduces good and well-flavoured pears on the graft; and if this\r\ngraft has a scion from the wild pear again grafted on it, the latter\r\nwill bear indifferent fruit. This shows that the same sap in the stem\r\nassumes different qualities in each graft. But still more forcible is\r\nhis proof of the fact, that plants do not take their substance direct\r\nfrom the earth, but produce it themselves by chemical processes. Take\r\na pot, he says, with seven to eight pounds of earth and grow in it any\r\nplant you like; the plant will find in this earth and in the rain-water\r\nwhich has fallen on it all the principles of which it is composed in\r\nits mature state. You may put three or four thousand different kinds of\r\nplants in this earth; if the salts, oils, earths were different in each\r\nspecies of plant, all these principles must be contained in the small\r\nquantity of earth and rain-water which falls upon it in the course of\r\nthree or four months, which is impossible; for each of these plants\r\nwould yield in the mature state a dram of fixed salt at least and two\r\ndrams of earth, and all these principles together with those which are\r\nmixed with the water would weigh at least from two to three ounces, and\r\nthis multiplied by four thousand, the number of the species of plants,\r\nwould give a weight of five hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThese arguments like those of Jung, and in the main also those of\r\nMalpighi, rested on facts which were on the whole as well known in\r\nancient times as in the 17th century; but no one had before given heed\r\nto considerations, which were in themselves quite sufficient to do\r\naway with the Aristotelian teaching on the subject of the nutrition of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of his letter Mariotte discusses the phenomena of\r\nvegetation which depend on nutrition; he compares the endosperm in the\r\nseed with the yolk of the egg in animals, and the entrance of the water\r\ninto the roots with its rising in capillary tubes; he takes the milky\r\njuice to be the nutrient sap and compares it with arterial blood, the\r\nother watery juices answering to venous blood. He says something quite\r\nnew about the pressure of the sap; he notices the high pressure at\r\nwhich the sap stands in plants, and concludes from it that there must\r\nbe contrivances in them, which allow of the ingress of the water but\r\nnot of its egress. The existence of the pressure is well demonstrated\r\nby the outflow from plants which contain milky juice when they are\r\nwounded, and is compared with the pressure on the blood in the veins.\r\nEqually striking is his further conclusion, that the pressure of the\r\nsap expands the roots, branches, and leaves, and so contributes to\r\ntheir growth. The sap, he adds, would not be able to remain at this\r\npressure, if it did not enter by pores, which forbid its return.\r\nIn these remarks lay the first germs of speculation on the growth\r\nof plants, such as we shall meet with in Hales also in a somewhat\r\ndifferent form, but in the backward state in which phytotomy then was\r\nthey could not at present be further developed; we shall recur to them\r\nfurther on, though in a different connection.\r\n\r\nMariotte concluded that the primary sap finds its way into the plant\r\nthrough the leaves as well as through the roots from the fact, that if\r\na branch is taken from a tree, and one of its smaller branches kept in\r\nwater, another will remain fresh for some days; the conclusion was not\r\nquite justified, as the future showed. His remarks on the necessity of\r\nsun-light to nutrition, on the ripening of fruit, and other matters,\r\nrests on very imperfect experience and need not be noticed.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic and the important point in Mariotte’s theory of\r\nnutrition is the marked contrast between his point of view in natural\r\nscience and the Aristotelian and scholastic doctrines still widely\r\ndiffused, and thus he is led to declare war also against Aristotle’s\r\nvegetable soul. He connects his remarks on this point with a fact which\r\nexcites his astonishment, namely that every species of plant reproduces\r\nits properties so exactly; no explanation of this fact, he says, is\r\ngained by the assumption of a vegetable soul, of which no one knows\r\nwhat it is. He declares as decidedly against the theory of evolution,\r\nalso much in vogue in his day. In opposition to the notion that all\r\nfuture generations are shut up one inside another in the seeds of a\r\nplant, he thinks it much more probable that the seeds only contain the\r\nessential substances, and that their influence on the crude sap brings\r\nabout the successive formation of the rest of the constituents of the\r\nplant, a view which we may still allow to be correct. He regards the\r\nwhole process of nutrition and life in plants as a play of physical\r\nforces, as the combination and separation of simple substances, but\r\nhe believes at the same time that he can prove the commonly received\r\ndoctrine of spontaneous generation to be a necessary conclusion from\r\nthis view. On this point he went wrong from want of sufficient and\r\nwell-sifted experience, for he regarded it as a proof of generatio\r\nspontanea that numerous plants spring up from the soil thrown out from\r\nditches and swamps that have been laid dry. ‘We may therefore suppose,’\r\nhe says, ‘that there are in the air, in the water, and in the earth\r\nan infinite number of minute bodies so fashioned that two or three\r\nuniting together may make the beginning of a plant, and represent the\r\nseed of such a plant, if they find a soil favourable to their growth.\r\nBut it is not probable that this little complex body contains already\r\nall the branches, leaves, fruits, and seeds of this plant, and still\r\nless that this seed contains all the branches, leaves, flowers, etc.,\r\nwhich proceed ad infinitum from the first germination.’ The contrary\r\nhe thinks is proved by the fact, that a rose-bush which has lost its\r\nleaves in the winter may produce in the next year nothing but leafy\r\nshoots from its flower buds, which shows that the blossoms were not\r\npreviously formed in those buds, and that a similar conclusion is to be\r\ndrawn from another fact, that the seeds of one and the same fruit-tree\r\nor of a melon produce descendants that differ from one another by\r\nvariation; here we have an argument against the theory of evolution\r\nmuch more to the purpose than the greater part of those which were\r\nalleged against it before Koelreuter obtained his hybrids.\r\n\r\nOther prejudices also of his day were opposed by Mariotte, and on\r\ngood grounds; the medicinal effects, commonly known as the ‘virtutes’\r\nof plants, played an important part in the botany, and still more in\r\nthe medicine and chemistry of that time. He rejects the old theory of\r\nheat and cold, moisture and dryness, things supposed to be essentially\r\nimmanent qualities of the substance of plants and used to explain\r\ntheir medicinal effects, and pointing to the fact, that poisonous\r\nplants grow in the same soil as harmless ones and side by side with\r\nthem, he concludes, as he had before concluded, that different plants\r\ndo not derive their peculiar constituents immediately from the soil,\r\nbut that they form them themselves by separation and combination of\r\nthe common principles. Finally he declared against one of the grossest\r\nerrors which had come down from the previous century, the ‘signatura\r\nplantarum,’ which supposed that the medicinal properties of plants\r\ncould be deduced from their external features, and especially from\r\nresemblances between their organs and the organs of the human body.\r\nMariotte insists that the medicinal properties of plants are to be\r\nascertained by trying them on sick people.\r\n\r\nMariotte’s letter, the most important parts of which have here been\r\ngiven, presents us with a lively picture of the views which prevailed\r\nin the second half of the 17th century respecting the life of plants;\r\nit shows at the same time how an eminent investigator of nature,\r\nadopting the principles of a more modern philosophy and knowing how\r\nto make a skilful use of the facts that were known to him, was led\r\nto oppose antiquated error, the result of prepossessions and want of\r\nreflection. If we combine the views of Malpighi on the internal economy\r\nof the plant, derived chiefly from its anatomy, with the chemical and\r\nphysical disquisitions of Mariotte, we have an entirely new theory of\r\nthe nutrition of plants, not only antagonistic to the Aristotelian\r\ndoctrine, but distinguished from it by a much greater wealth of ideas\r\nand by more sagacious combinations.\r\n\r\nThese two men had in truth discovered all the principles of vegetable\r\nlife and nutrition, which could have been discovered in the existing\r\ncondition of phytotomy and chemistry; Mariotte especially had succeeded\r\nin applying the very best that was to be obtained from the uncertain\r\nchemical knowledge of his day to the explanation of the phenomena of\r\nvegetation. Chemistry was at that time beginning to set herself free\r\nfrom the notions of the medical science, the iatro-chemistry of a\r\nformer age, only to throw herself into the arms of the theory of the\r\nphlogiston; and how little she could contribute to the explanation of\r\nthe processes of nutrition in plants, how little the methods then in\r\nuse were adapted to the examination of organised bodies, may be learnt\r\nfrom a little book published in 1676 and again in 1679, ‘Mémoires pour\r\nservir à l’histoire des plantes,’ which appeared indeed in Dodart’s\r\nname, but which was compiled and approved by the body of members of\r\nthe Academy of Paris. It contains no results of investigation, but\r\na detailed scheme for researches into botanical science, and more\r\nparticularly into the chemical part of it. There we read, that plants\r\nmust be burnt slowly, in order that the destroying and transmuting\r\npower of the fire may have less effect; the ‘virtutes plantarum’ play\r\nan important part in the chemical examination of plants, and blood\r\nwas mixed with their juices, in order to discover their properties.\r\nA writer named Dedu in a treatise, ‘De l’âme des plantes’ (1685)\r\nderived the generation and growth of plants from the fermentation and\r\neffervescence of the acids in combination with the alkalies, as Kurt\r\nSprengel informs us. It is by comparison with these and similar notions\r\nthat we recognise the full superiority of the utterances of Malpighi\r\nand Mariotte respecting the nutrition of plants, and their sagacity\r\nis still further shown by the fact, that there are some things which\r\nthey forebore to say, evidently because they thought that they were not\r\nclearly proved.\r\n\r\nThe views of Malpighi and Mariotte on the nutrition of plants were\r\nrespected and often quoted by their contemporaries and immediate\r\nsuccessors; but as has happened in other cases unfortunately up to\r\nrecent times, much that was fundamentally important and significant\r\nin them was neglected from the first for comparatively unimportant\r\nmatters, and the views of these clear thinkers were so mixed up with\r\nindistinct ideas and actual misconceptions, that no real advance was\r\nmade, though a variety of new facts were from time to time brought to\r\nlight. It has been already noticed that Malpighi’s correct idea of\r\nthe connection of the leaves with the nutrition of the plant was at\r\na later time commonly supposed to be equivalent to Major’s theory of\r\ncirculation, and since the latter was for various reasons considered to\r\nbe incorrect, it was thought that Malpighi’s view was dismissed with\r\nit. Yet even Major’s theory deserved the preference over the views of\r\nthose who assumed only an ascent of the sap in the wood, because it\r\nat least attempted to account for certain phenomena of growth. It\r\nfound a new supporter in 1680 in the person of Claude Perrault, who\r\ndoes not however appear[122] to have added anything essentially new\r\nto Malpighi’s conclusive arguments for a returning sap. Nor did his\r\nopponent Magnol in his very weak treatise published in 1709 succeed\r\nin saying anything that will bear examination against the theory of\r\ncirculation, which he too ascribed to Malpighi.\r\n\r\nAmong the phenomena of vegetation in woody plants, there is scarcely\r\none so striking as the outflow of watery sap from wounded vines and\r\nfrom some tree-stems in the spring. This phenomenon, like the outflow\r\nof milky juice, gum, resin and the like, could not fail to be regarded\r\nwith lively interest by those who occupied themselves with vegetable\r\nphysiology in the 17th century. Even supposing the movements of water\r\nin the wood and of the milky and other juices in their passages not\r\nto be necessary accompaniments of the nutrition of plants, yet it was\r\nnatural that the physiologists of the 17th century should see in them\r\nstriking proofs of that movement of the sap which is connected with\r\nnutrition, and should therefore make them a subject of study. It might\r\nalso seem to them that the problem in question was easy to solve,\r\nfor it was not till long after that it came to be understood that\r\nthese movements are in reality one of the most difficult questions of\r\nvegetable physiology. We discover the interest taken in these matters\r\nfrom a series of communications in the form of letters from Dr. Tonge,\r\nFrancis Willoughby, and especially from Dr. Martin Lister, to be found\r\nin the Philosophical Transactions for 1670[123]. The phenomenon to\r\nwhich these men chiefly directed their attention was just the one best\r\ncalculated to lead to misconceptions respecting the movements of water\r\nin woody plants, namely that which is known as the bleeding of the\r\nwood in winter, and which depends on entirely different causes from\r\nthose which produce the weeping of the vine and other woody plants in\r\nspring; but the two things were supposed to be identical, and hence\r\narose an unfortunate confusion of ideas. Lister indeed showed that it\r\nis possible to force water out of the wood of a portion of a branch\r\ncut from a tree in winter time by warming it artificially, and then\r\nto cause the water to be sucked in again by cooling it; but it was\r\nreserved for a modern physiologist to prove that this phenomenon has\r\nnothing to do with the bleeding of cut stems from root-pressure, and\r\ncannot be used to explain it.\r\n\r\nJohn Ray, who gave a clear and intelligent summary of all that was\r\nknown respecting the nutrition of plants in the first volume of his\r\n‘Historia plantarum’ (1693), also communicated some experiments made\r\nby himself on the movements of water in the wood. He follows Grew’s\r\nnomenclature, who called the ascending sap in the wood lymph and the\r\nwoody fibres therefore lymph-vessels, and notices particularly that\r\nthe lymph especially in spring cannot be distinguished in taste or in\r\nconsistence from common water. He agrees with Grew that in spring the\r\nlymph fills the true vascular tubes of the wood and oozes from them\r\nin cross sections, while in summer these are filled with air, and the\r\nlymph at that time, when there is strong transpiration in woody plants,\r\nascends only in the lymph-vessels, that is in the fibrous elements of\r\nthe wood and the bast. By suitable incisions Ray proved that the lymph\r\ncan also move laterally in the wood; and by causing water to filter in\r\nopposite directions through pieces of a branch cut off at both ends, he\r\nrefuted those who thought that the cavities of the wood and especially\r\nthe vessels were furnished with valves to hinder the return of the\r\nlymph. But his knowledge of the mechanical causes of the movement of\r\nwater in the wood was not very great.\r\n\r\nSome years elapsed before Hales’ labours added materially to the\r\nprogress which had been already made in the study of these processes\r\nin vegetation. His important services to vegetable physiology close\r\nour present period, but before we pass on to them, we must first\r\nnotice a few less important writers. The pages of Woodward and Beale\r\non transpiration and the absorption of water are not very valuable\r\ncontributions to the theory of nutrition. The fact stated by Woodward,\r\nthat a Mentha growing in water took up and discharged by evaporation\r\nthrough the leaves forty-six times as much water as it retained in\r\nitself, was perhaps the most important of all that he discovered, but\r\nhis own conclusions from it were of no value.\r\n\r\nNone of Malpighi’s doctrines had from the first excited so much\r\nattention as the one which makes the air which is necessary for the\r\nrespiration of the plant circulate in the spiral vessels of the wood,\r\nas it does in the tracheae in insects; while Grew and Ray after him\r\nagreed with Malpighi in the main, his countryman Sbaraglia in 1704\r\nventured even to deny the existence of such vessels, and before long\r\nphytotomy was fallen into such a state of decadence that the question,\r\nwhether there were any vessels, or as they were then called spiral\r\nvessels, at all, was repeatedly affirmed and as often denied again,\r\nand ultimately it was thought better in the interest of physiological\r\nquestions to take counsel of experiment rather than of the microscope.\r\nThus in 1715 Nieuwentyt endeavoured with the help of the air-pump to\r\nmake the air contained in the vessels issue in a visible form under\r\na fluid. Here we again encounter the philosopher Christian Wolff as\r\na zealous representative of vegetable physiology in Germany; in the\r\nthird part of his work, ‘Allerhand nützliche Versuche,’ 1721, among\r\nother experiments he mentions some which confirmed the presence of air\r\nin plants; the question was more interesting, in the state in which\r\nphysics and chemistry then were, than that of the anatomical character\r\nof the air-conducting organs. Wolff submitted leaves lying in water\r\ncontaining no air to the vacuum of the air-pump, and saw air-bubbles\r\nissue, especially on the under side; but when he allowed the\r\natmospheric pressure to come into play again the leaves became filled\r\nwith water, and a piece of fir-wood treated in a similar manner sank\r\nafter the infiltration. In similar experiments with apricots air issued\r\nfrom the rind and especially from the stalk. Wolff’s pupil Thümmig\r\ndescribed similar experiments in his ‘Gründliche Erläuterung der\r\nmerkwürdigsten Begebenheiten in der Natur,’ 1723, and both continued in\r\nthis question, as in all their physiological and phytotomical views,\r\nfaithful adherents of Malpighi, as it was wisest then to be. We must\r\nlinger a moment longer over Christian Wolff, because he published a\r\nfew years later a general view of the nutrition of plants in a popular\r\nform. Wolff’s services in the dissemination of natural science in\r\nGermany seem not to have been as highly appreciated up to the present\r\ntime as they deserve to be; his various works on natural science,\r\nsome of which took a wide range and were partly founded on his own\r\nobservations, were full of matter and for his time very instructive;\r\nthey contributed moreover to introduce more liberal habits of thought\r\nat a time when gross superstitions, such as that of palingenesia,\r\nreigned even among men who published scientific treatises in the German\r\nAcademy of Sciences (the ‘Acta of the Leopoldina).’ If Wolff’s own\r\nscientific researches show more good will than skill, yet he had an\r\nadvantage over many others in a really philosophical training, a habit\r\nof abstract thought which enabled him to fix with certainty on what\r\nwas fundamentally important in the observations of others, and thus\r\nto expound the scientific knowledge of his day from higher points of\r\nview. For this reason his work which appeared in 1723, ‘Vernünftige\r\nGedanken von den Wirkungen der Natur,’ deserves recognition. It is a\r\nwork of the kind which would now be called a ‘Kosmos,’ and treats of\r\nthe physical qualities of bodies generally, of the heavenly bodies\r\nand specially of our own planet, of meteorology, physical geography,\r\nand lastly of minerals, plants, animals and men. In accordance with\r\nhis chief object, general instruction, it is written in German and\r\nin a good homely style, and contains the best information that was\r\nat that time to be obtained on scientific subjects; among these he\r\ngives an account of the processes of nutrition in plants, in which he\r\nmade careful and intelligent use of all that had been written on the\r\nsubject, bringing together all the serviceable material which he could\r\ngather from Malpighi, Grew, Leeuwenhoek, Van Helmont, Mariotte and\r\nothers into a connected system, and occasionally introducing pertinent\r\ncritical remarks. If we consider the state of scientific literature in\r\nGermany in the first years of the 18th century, we shall be inclined\r\nto assign as great merit to comprehensive text-books of this popular\r\ncharacter as to new investigations and minor discoveries. Wolff’s\r\nchapter on nutrition has however a special interest for us, because it\r\ncontains several observations of value which were lost sight of after\r\nhis time. These refer chiefly to the chemistry of nutrition and touch\r\nmany problems which were not solved before our time; for instance,\r\nthe statement that it is a well-known fact that the earth loses its\r\nfruitfulness, if much is grown on it; that it requires much to feed\r\nit, and must be manured with dung or ashes; in these few words we have\r\nthe questions of the exhaustion of the soil, and the restitution of\r\nthe substances taken from it by the crop, brought into notice by Wolff\r\nat this early period. ‘It should be particularly noted,’ continues\r\nWolff, ‘how fruitful nitre makes the soil; Vallemont has praised\r\nthe usefulness of nitre, and has mentioned other things which have\r\na like operation by reason of their saline and oily particles, such\r\nas horn from the horns and hoofs of animals; dung likewise contains\r\nsaline and oily particles, which are present in the ash also, and we\r\nsee therefore that such particles should not be wanting, if a plant\r\nis to be fed from water. The seed also, which supplies the first food\r\nof the plant, shows the same thing, for there are none which do not\r\ncontain oil and salt, and there are many from which the oil may be\r\nsqueezed out; and oil and salt are found in all plants if they are\r\nexamined chemically.’ He insists on the correctness of the view taken\r\nby Malpighi and Mariotte, that the constituents of the food must be\r\nchemically altered in the plant. Since every plant, he says, has its\r\nown particular salt and its own particular oil, we must readily allow\r\nthat these are produced in the plant and not introduced into it. But at\r\nthe same time since plants cannot grow where the soil does not supply\r\nthem with saline and especially with nitrous particles, it is from\r\nthese that the salts and oils in the plant must be produced, and the\r\nwater also changed into a nutritious juice. Further on he alludes to\r\nthe saline, nitrous and oily particles which float in the air, and says\r\nthat daily experience shows that most of the substance of putrefying\r\nbodies passes into the air, and that if we admit light through a\r\nnarrow opening into a dark place, we can see a great number of little\r\nparticles of dust floating about; water also readily takes up salt and\r\nearth, and mineral springs show that metallic particles are mixed with\r\nit. Therefore there is no reason to doubt that rain-water also contains\r\na variety of matters which it conveys to the plant. Alluding once more\r\nto the chemical changes in the constituents of the food which must be\r\nsupposed to take place in the plant, he connects the subject with some\r\nremarks on the organs of plants, in which he closely follows Malpighi;\r\nhe says that these changes cannot take place in tubes, because the\r\nsap merely rises or falls in them; we can only therefore suppose that\r\nit is in the spongy substance (the cellular tissue) that the nutrient\r\nsap is elaborated, and accordingly the vesicles or utriculi are a kind\r\nof stomach; but the change in the water can only be this, that the\r\nparticles of various substances which are in rain-water are separated\r\nfrom it and united together in some special manner, and this cannot be\r\neffected without special movements. But his ideas on these movements\r\nin the sap are somewhat obscure. He employs the expansion of the air\r\nand the capillarity of the woody tubes as his moving forces. He agrees\r\ndecidedly with those who postulated a returning sap as well as an\r\nascending crude sap, but he appeals in this matter to Major, Perrault,\r\nand Mariotte, and not to Malpighi; yet like Malpighi he notices the\r\ngrowth of trees set upside down as a proof that the juices can move\r\nin opposite directions in the conducting organs, and with Mariotte he\r\nascribes the enlargement of growing organs to the expanding power of\r\nthe juices which force their way into them.\r\n\r\nBut these well-meant efforts on the part of Christian Wolff, and indeed\r\nall that was done from Malpighi and Mariotte to Ingen-Houss to advance\r\nthe knowledge of the nutrition of plants, was thrown into the shade by\r\nthe brilliant investigations of STEPHEN HALES[124] in whom we see once\r\nmore the genius of discovery and the sound original reasoning powers of\r\nthe great explorers of nature in Newton’s age. His ‘Statical Essays,’\r\nfirst published in 1727, reappeared in two new editions in English, and\r\nafterwards in French, Italian and German translations; in the last with\r\na preface by Christian Wolff. This was the first work devoted to a more\r\ncomplete account of the nutrition of plants and of the movements of the\r\nsap in them, and while it noticed what had been already written on the\r\nsubject, it was chiefly composed of the author’s own investigations.\r\nAn abundance of new experiments and observations, measurements and\r\ncalculations combine to form a living picture of the whole subject.\r\nMalpighi endeavoured to discover the physiological functions of organs\r\nby the aid of analogies and a reference to their structure; Mariotte\r\ndiscerned the main features of the connection between plants and\r\ntheir environment by combining together physical and chemical facts;\r\nHales may be said to have made his plants themselves speak; by means\r\nof cleverly contrived and skilfully managed experiments he compelled\r\nthem to disclose the forces that were at work in them by effects made\r\napparent to the eye, and thus to show that forces of a very peculiar\r\nkind are in constant activity in the quiet and apparently passive\r\norgans of vegetation. Penetrated with the spirit of Newton’s age,\r\nwhich notwithstanding its strictly teleological and even theological\r\nconception of nature did endeavour to explain all the phenomena of life\r\nmechanically by the attraction and repulsion of material particles,\r\nHales was not content with giving a clear idea of the phenomena of\r\nvegetation, but sought to trace them back to mechanico-physical laws as\r\nthen understood. He infused life into the empirical materials which he\r\ncollected by means of ingenious reflections, which brought individual\r\nfacts into connection with more general considerations. Such a book\r\nnecessarily attracted great attention, and for us it is a source of\r\nmuch valuable instruction on matters of detail, though we now gather up\r\nthe phenomena of vegetation into a somewhat differently connected whole.\r\n\r\nHis investigations into transpiration and the movement of water in\r\nthe wood were greeted with the warmest approbation. He measured the\r\nquantity of water sucked in by the roots and given off by the leaves,\r\ncompared this with the supply of moisture contained in the earth,\r\nand endeavoured to calculate the rapidity with which the water rises\r\nin the stem, and to compare it with the rapidity of its entrance\r\ninto the roots and its exit by the leaves. The experiments, by which\r\nhe showed the force of suction in wood and roots, and that of the\r\nroot-pressure in the case of the bleeding vine, were particularly\r\nstriking and instructive. His measurements and the figures, on which\r\nhe founded his calculations, were not so exact as they were often at a\r\nlater time supposed to be, but he was himself satisfied with obtaining\r\nround, approximative numbers; these under given circumstances supplied\r\na sufficient basis for propositions which were new and afforded a\r\ncertain amount of insight into the economy of the plant. This mode of\r\nproceeding showed his understanding; for the case of living bodies\r\nis different from that of metals and gases; in these we seek for\r\nconstants which can then be inserted in general formulae, and to which\r\ntherefore the nicest accuracy is applied; but in plants we have to\r\ndeal with individual cases, and it is from a right interpretation of\r\nthe measurements taken from them that we can arrive at general laws of\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nTo show that the forces of suction and pressure which operate in\r\nplants are not something sui generis, but prevail also in dead matter,\r\nin other words that they are an example of the general attraction of\r\nmatter, a subject of particular interest at that time, Hales observed\r\nthe absorption of water by substances with fine pores; and measured\r\nthe force employed. These processes he compared with the force which\r\nswelling peas exert on the obstacles which they encounter, and thus\r\nobtained a more correct idea of the forces concerned in the movement of\r\nwater in the plant than that given by the capillarity of glass-tubes,\r\nwhich Mariotte and Ray had employed to illustrate them.\r\n\r\nHales failed to appreciate the value of Malpighi’s observations on\r\nthe function of leaves, and was induced by the copiousness of the\r\nevaporation of water from their surfaces to overrate the physiological\r\nimportance of that process; hence he saw in leaves chiefly organs of\r\ntranspiration, which raise the sap by suction from the roots through\r\nthe stem. In accordance with this view he denied the existence of a\r\ndescending sap in the bark, and only admitted that the ascending sap\r\nin the wood might possibly sink in the night in consequence of the\r\nlowering of the temperature, like the quicksilver in a thermometer, and\r\nthat so far there might be a return-movement. This was the weak point\r\nin Hales’ system.\r\n\r\nOne of his most important discoveries has generally been overlooked\r\neven in modern times, probably because it was entirely neglected by\r\nhis successors in the 18th century; he was the first who proved,\r\nthat air co-operates in the building up the body of the plant, in\r\nthe formation of its solid substance, and that gaseous constituents\r\ncontribute largely to the nourishment of the plant; consequently\r\nthat neither water, nor the substances which it carries with it from\r\nthe earth, alone supply the material of which plants are composed,\r\nas had been generally imagined. He showed also with the aid of the\r\nair-pump, and better than Nieuwentyt and Wolff, that air enters the\r\nplant not only through the leaves but also through apertures in the\r\nrind, and circulates in the cavities of the wood. He then connected\r\nthis with the fact which he had confirmed by numerous experiments,\r\nthat large quantities of ‘air’ are obtained from vegetable substance\r\nby fermentation and dry distillation; the air thus set free by\r\nfermentation and heat must in his opinion be condensed and changed to\r\na solid condition during the period of vegetation. He says in chap. 7,\r\nthat we find by chemical analysis (dry distillation) of vegetables,\r\nthat their substance is composed of sulphur, volatile salt, water\r\nand earth; these principles are all endowed with mutual power of\r\nattraction (of their parts). But air also enters into the composition\r\nof the plant, and this in its solid state is powerfully attractive,\r\nbut in an elastic condition has the highest powers of repulsion. It is\r\non infinitely various combinations, actions, and reactions of these\r\nprinciples that all activity in animal and vegetable bodies depends. In\r\nnutrition the sum of the forces of attraction is greater than that of\r\nthe forces of repulsion, and thus the viscid ductile parts are first\r\nproduced, and then by evaporation of the water the harder parts.\r\nBut if the latter again absorb water, and the forces of repulsion\r\nconsequently gain the preponderance, then the consistence of the\r\nvegetable parts is dissolved, and this decomposition restores to them\r\nthe power of forming new vegetable products; therefore the stock of\r\nnutritive substance in nature can never be exhausted; this stock is the\r\nsame in animals and plants, and is fitted by a small change of texture\r\nto feed the one or the other.\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say, that it results from his experiments, that leaves\r\nare very useful for the nourishing of the plant, inasmuch as they\r\ndraw up the food from the earth; but they seem also to be adapted to\r\nother noble and important services; they remove the superfluous water\r\nby evaporation, retaining the parts of it that are nutritious, while\r\nthey also absorb salt, nitre, and the like substances, and dew, and\r\nrain; and since, like Newton, he regarded light as a substance, he\r\nconcludes by asking: ‘may not light, which makes its way into the outer\r\nsurfaces of leaves and flowers, contribute much to the refining of the\r\nsubstances in the plant?’\r\n\r\nIt might be gathered from these expressions that Hales attributed\r\nimportance for purposes of nutrition only to the substances suspended\r\nin the air; but this was not the case; for we read in the 6th\r\nchapter, that he had proved by experiment that a quantity of true\r\npermanently elastic air is obtained from vegetable and animal bodies by\r\nfermentation and dissolution (dry distillation); the air is to a great\r\nextent immediately and firmly incorporated with the substance of these\r\nbodies, and it follows therefore that a large quantity of elastic air\r\nmust be constantly used in forming them.\r\n\r\nBut Hales not only regards the air as a nourishing substance, but\r\nhe sees also in its elasticity, which counteracts the attraction of\r\nother substances, the origin of the force which maintains the internal\r\nmovements in the plant. He says that if all matter were endowed only\r\nwith forces of attraction, all nature would at once contract into an\r\ninactive mass; it was therefore absolutely necessary in order to set\r\nin movement and animate this huge mass of attracting matter, that a\r\nsufficient quantity of strongly repellent and elastic matter should be\r\nmixed with it; and since a large portion of these elastic particles\r\nare constantly changing to a solid condition through the attraction of\r\nthe other parts, they must be endowed with the power of again assuming\r\ntheir elastic condition, when they are set free from the attracting\r\nmass. Thus the formation and dissolution of animal and vegetable bodies\r\ngo on in constant succession. Air is therefore very important to the\r\nproduction and growth of animals and plants in two ways; it invigorates\r\ntheir juices while it is in the elastic state, and contributes much to\r\nthe firm union of the constituent parts, when it has become fixed.\r\n\r\nWe see what good use Hales could make of the small stock of ideas in\r\nphysics and chemistry at his disposal, and that he succeeded with their\r\nhelp in rising to a point of view, from which he was able to form some\r\nidea of the phenomena of vegetation in their most important relations\r\nto the rest of nature, and in their inner course and connection. But\r\nhis successors did not comprehend the fundamental importance of these\r\nconsiderations, and made no use of the pregnant idea, that a much\r\nlarger part of the substance of plants comes from the air and not from\r\nthe water or the soil; they were for ever wondering that so little is\r\nfurnished by the soil to the plant, as Van Helmont had shown, though\r\nthey did not confess to supposing that the water was changed into the\r\nsubstance of the plant, as he had imagined. Thus physiologists lost\r\nsight of the principle, which might long before the time of Ingen-Houss\r\nhave sufficiently explained the most important of all the relations of\r\nthe plant to the outer world, namely that it derives its food from the\r\nconstituents of the atmosphere, and so neglected further experimental\r\nenquiry into the matter; they quoted and repeated Hales’ experiments\r\nand observations again and again, but forgot that which in his mind\r\nbound all the separate facts together.\r\n\r\nHales is the last of the great naturalists who laid the foundations of\r\nvegetable physiology. Strange as some of their ideas may seem to us,\r\nyet these observers were the first who gained any deep insight into the\r\nhidden machinery of vegetable life, and handed down to us a knowledge\r\nboth of individual facts and of their most important relations. If we\r\ncompare what was known before Malpighi’s time with the contents of\r\nHales’ book, we shall be astonished at the rapid advance made in less\r\nthan sixty years, while scarcely anything had been contributed to the\r\nsubject in the period between Aristotle and Malpighi.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN THE MOVEMENT OF THE SAP IN PLANTS.\r\n1730-1780.\r\n\r\nIf those, who studied the nutrition of plants and especially the\r\nmovement of their sap in the period between Hales and Ingen-Houss, had\r\nkept a firm hold on Malpighi’s view, that the nutritive substances are\r\nelaborated in the leaves, and had combined it with Hales’ idea, that\r\nplants derive a large portion of their substance from the air, they\r\nwould have had a principle to guide them in their investigations into\r\nthe movement of the sap; and by experimenting on living plants they\r\nmight have succeeded in giving a more definite expression to these\r\nideas, even though chemistry and physics supplied during that time no\r\nnew aids. We have said already that such was not the course of events;\r\nphysiologists confined their attention to the obvious phenomena of\r\nvegetation, and trusted in so doing to gain a firmer footing, but in\r\nthis they never got beyond a commonplace and unreflecting empiricism,\r\nbecause their observation was without an object, and their conclusions\r\nwithout a principle. They wandered from the right direction, as always\r\nhappens when observation is not guided by a well-considered hypothesis;\r\nand their conceptions were rendered more obscure by their imperfect\r\nacquaintance with one of the most important aids to understanding\r\nthe movement of the sap, namely the structure of the more delicate\r\nparts of the plant, the knowledge of which had not advanced since the\r\ndays of Malpighi and Grew. Since most of them made no phytotomical\r\ninvestigations of their own, and only partially understood the\r\ndescriptions of those writers, they had to be content with misty and\r\noften quite inaccurate ideas of the inner structure of wood and bark,\r\nand yet expected to obtain an insight into the movement of the sap\r\nin them. In reading the writings of Malpighi, Grew, Mariotte, Hales\r\nand even Wolff, notwithstanding many mistakes in details we find a\r\npleasure in the connected reasoning, and in the sagacity which knew how\r\nto distinguish between what was important and what was not; whereas\r\nthe observers, whom we have now to mention, give us only isolated\r\nstatements, nor have we the satisfaction of feeling that we are\r\nconversing with men of superior understanding.\r\n\r\nWe may pass over the unimportant writings of Friedrich Walther (1740),\r\nAnton Wilhelm Platz (1751) and Rudolph Böhmer (1753), as merely barren\r\nexercises; but some notice should be taken of those of De la Baisse\r\nand Reichel, since these authors at least endeavoured to bring to\r\nlight something new. But the method which they employed of making\r\nliving plants suck up coloured fluids was calculated to give rise to\r\nserious errors both at the time and afterwards. Magnol had mentioned\r\nexperiments of the kind in 1709, and the Jesuit father Sarrabat, known\r\nby the name of DE LA BAISSE, occupied himself with them and described\r\nthem in a treatise, ‘Sur la circulation de la sêve des plantes,’ 1733,\r\nwhich received a prize from the academy of Bordeaux[125]. He set the\r\nroots of different plants in the red juice of the fruit of Phytolacca,\r\nand found that in two or three days the whole of the bark of the roots\r\nand especially the tips of the root-fibres were coloured red inside.\r\nIt was a natural conclusion at that time, that it was these parts which\r\nchiefly absorbed the red colouring matter, and in fact this opinion was\r\nmaintained till quite recent times, and it was on such results that\r\nPyrame de Candolle founded his theory of the spongioles of the root,\r\nwhich is still accepted in France. At present it is known, that the\r\nbark and especially the youngest tips of the fibres of the root are not\r\ncoloured under these circumstances, until they have been first poisoned\r\nand killed by the colouring matter; these experiments therefore,\r\nwhich have been frequently repeated since De la Baisse’s time, prove\r\nnothing respecting the action of living roots, but they were from the\r\nfirst the cause of a pernicious error in vegetable physiology, which\r\nas we shall see gave rise to others also. One result however of De la\r\nBaisse’s experiments was less misleading; he placed the cut ends of\r\nbranches of woody plants in the coloured fluid, and found that not only\r\nthe general body of the wood, but the woody bundles which pass from\r\nit into the leaves and parts of the flowers, were coloured red, while\r\nthe succulent tissue of the bark and leaves remained uncoloured. It\r\nappeared therefore that the red juice passed only through the wood,\r\nand a somewhat bold analogy might lead to the further conclusion that\r\nthis is true also of the nutrient substances dissolved in the watery\r\nsap; but the view so stated is not at present considered to be correct,\r\nand that the sap which ascends from the roots to the leaves, the\r\nwater especially, is conveyed through the wood only, and not through\r\nthe rind, had been already sufficiently proved by the experiments of\r\nHales and others. The uncritical treatment of experiments of this kind\r\nby GEORG CHRISTIAN REICHEL[126] afterwards led to new errors, though\r\nhis dissertation, ‘De vasis plantarum spiralibus,’ shows to advantage\r\nby the side of similar productions of the day owing to its careful\r\nnotices of the literature, and the author’s original researches in\r\nphytotomy. Reichel was not satisfied with the arguments of Malpighi,\r\nNieuwentyt, Wolff, Thümmig and Hales for the view that the vessels of\r\nthe wood contain air. He observed quite correctly, that if branches\r\nare cut off from woody and herbaceous plants and the cut surfaces\r\nare placed in red decoction of brazil-wood, the red colouring matter\r\nspreads through all the vascular bundles, even those of the flowers\r\nand fruit; but on examination with the microscope he found the red\r\nfluid to some extent in the cavities of the vessels, and hastily\r\nconcluded that they too in the natural condition convey sap and not\r\nair. His description and his drawing show however, that only some\r\nvessels had received any of the red fluid and that none of these were\r\nfilled with it. Reichel and the many who repeated his statements\r\nforgot to ask whether the vessels had contained air or fluid before\r\nthe experiment, or whether the result would have been the same, if\r\nplants with uninjured and living roots had absorbed the coloured fluid,\r\nand no divided vessels had therefore come in contact with it. There\r\nwas no reason why observers of that day should not have been alive to\r\nthe simple consideration, that the vessels of a branch parted from\r\nthe stem and placed in a fluid must necessarily show the capillary\r\naction of narrow glass tubes if they are filled with air in their\r\nnatural condition, and that in the experiment the transpiration of the\r\nleaves must favour the ascent of the red juice in the cavities of the\r\nvessels, as was to be gathered from other and better experiments made\r\nby Hales. But these obvious reflections were not made; the supposed\r\nresults of the experiment were heedlessly accepted, and the unfounded\r\nnotion, that vessels are natural sap-conducting organs, was set up\r\nin opposition to the trustworthy decision of Malpighi and Grew, that\r\nthey convey air. Thus on the strength of badly interpreted experiments\r\none of the most important of physiological discoveries was called in\r\nquestion, and a hundred years later there were persons, who, relying\r\non the same experiments as Reichel, supposed that the vessels of\r\nthe wood convey the ascending sap, a view which made it impossible\r\nfrom the first to arrive at any real understanding of the movement\r\nof the sap in plants provided with organs of transpiration. But even\r\nthe other great discovery which we owe to Malpighi, that leaves are\r\norgans for elaborating the food, was denied by Bonnet, who substituted\r\nfor it the utterly false view, that they chiefly serve to absorb\r\nrain-water and dew. BONNET[127], who had previously done good service\r\nto insect-biology, and had discovered the asexual propagation of\r\naphides, having injured his eyes in these studies, found an agreeable\r\npastime in a variety of experiments on plants. Much that he did was\r\nunimportant, yet he obtained some results, which could afterwards be\r\nturned to account by more competent persons, for the weakness of his\r\nown judgment is shown even in his more serviceable observations, such\r\nas those on the curvature of growing plants. We notice the same defect\r\nin his observations on the part played by leaves in the nutrition of\r\nthe plant. It shows the character of the time that a book like Bonnet’s\r\n‘Recherches sur l’usage des feuilles des plantes,’ a mere accumulation\r\nof undigested facts, should have been generally considered an important\r\nproduction. He tells us, that his attention was called by Calandrini\r\nto the fact, that the structure of the under side of leaves seems to\r\nshow that they were intended to absorb ‘the dew that rises from the\r\nground’ and introduce it into the plant. Starting from this sensible\r\nsuggestion, as he calls it, he proceeded to make a variety of senseless\r\nexperiments with leaves, which were cut off from their plants, and\r\nhaving been smeared over with oil or other hurtful substances were laid\r\non water, some on their upper some on their under side, the object\r\nbeing to note the time which they took to perish. It is impossible to\r\nimagine worse-devised experiments on vegetation; for if Bonnet wished\r\nto test Calandrini’s ‘sensible’ conjecture, he ought certainly to have\r\nleft the leaves on the living plants and have observed the effect of\r\nthe supposed absorption of dew on the vegetation. It is to be observed,\r\nthat by rising dew he evidently meant aqueous vapour, for the real dew\r\ndescends chiefly on the upper side of the leaf; and what could he have\r\nexpected to learn by laying cut leaves on water? how could this prove\r\nthat leaves absorb dew? Nevertheless Bonnet came to the conclusion that\r\nthe most important function of leaves was to absorb dew, and in order\r\nto make this result agree with Hales’ investigations on transpiration,\r\nhe propounded the theory[128], that the sap which rises by day from\r\nthe roots into the stem is carried by the woody fibres assisted by\r\nthe air-tubes into the under side of the leaves, where there are many\r\nstomata to facilitate its exit (evaporation). At the approach of night,\r\nwhen the leaves and the air in the air-tubes are no longer under the\r\ninfluence of heat, the sap returns to the roots; then the under side\r\nof the leaves commences its other function; the dew slowly rising\r\nfrom the earth strikes against it, condenses upon it, and is detained\r\nthere by the fine hairs and by other contrivances (this really takes\r\nplace to a much greater extent on the upper side). The fine tubes of\r\nthe leaves absorb it at once, (this is evidently not so, since the dew\r\nincreases in quantity till sunrise), and conduct it to the branches,\r\nwhence it passes into the stem. He thought so highly of this strange\r\ntheory, that he believed he found in it a teleological explanation of\r\nthe heliotropic and geotropic curvature of leaves and stems, two things\r\nwhich he did not distinguish, and of the position of leaves on the\r\nstem. Bonnet’s view of the functions of leaves, foolish as it is, is\r\nhistorically important and therefore required to be noticed, because it\r\nwas really accepted during many years in preference to the older and\r\nbetter ideas, and because it shows how the power of judging of such\r\nmatters had fallen off since Malpighi’s time. It appears to have been\r\nthe praise lavished on Bonnet by his contemporaries that made later\r\nphysiologists, who might have known better, take him for an authority\r\non the nutrition of plants. His experiments on the growth of plants\r\nin another material than earth are if possible more worthless than\r\nthose with cut leaves. Here too the idea was not his own; for hearing\r\nthat land-plants had been grown in Berlin in moss instead of earth,\r\nhe made numerous experiments of the kind, and found that many plants\r\ngrow vigorously in this way, and bloom and bear seed. But the theory\r\nof nutrition gained nothing by these experiments, which were only a\r\nchildish amusement. The few pages which Malpighi wrote on the nutrition\r\nof plants are worth more than all Bonnet’s book on the use of leaves;\r\nthe former by the help of some simple considerations and conclusions\r\nfrom analogy really discovered the use of leaves; Bonnet on the faith\r\nof many unmeaning experiments ascribed to them another function than\r\nthe true one.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to pass a much more favourable judgment on the views\r\nrespecting the nutrition of plants of another writer, who otherwise\r\ndid good service to vegetable physiology, and to whom we shall return\r\nin our last chapter. It is true that DU HAMEL[129], of whom we speak,\r\nwas not an investigator of nature, as were Malpighi, Mariotte or\r\nHales; compared with those great thinkers he was only a compiler, and\r\na somewhat uncritical one. But he was not a dilettante in science,\r\nlike Bonnet; he made the vegetable world the subject of serious and\r\ndiligent study, and he endeavoured to turn the results of that study\r\nto practical account. Long familiarity with plants gave him a kind\r\nof instinct for the truth in dealing with them, as is shown in his\r\nobservations and experiments, many of which are still instructive;\r\nbut he had neither that faculty of combination which can alone bring\r\na meaning out of experiments and observations in physiological\r\ninvestigations, nor the power to distinguish between matters of\r\nfundamental and secondary importance. So thinks also his biographer Du\r\nPetit-Thonars.\r\n\r\nThe merits and the faults here mentioned are combined in an especial\r\ndegree in Du Hamel’s most famous work, ‘Physique des arbres,’ which\r\nappeared in two volumes in 1758 and is a text-book of vegetable anatomy\r\nand physiology with numerous plates. His remarks on the nutrition of\r\nplants and the movement of the sap are a lengthy compilation chiefly\r\nfrom Malpighi, Mariotte and Hales, though he has not succeeded in\r\nappropriating exactly that which is theoretically important or adopting\r\nthe most commanding points of view. He introduces the results of his\r\nown experiments into his account, and these are often instructive in\r\nthemselves, but are never made use of to establish a definite view with\r\nrespect to the connection between the processes of nutrition. He hits\r\nupon the right view only when he is dealing with plain and obvious\r\nmatters; for instance, he restores the vessels of the wood to their old\r\nrights, and concludes from experiments, as had been already done in the\r\n17th century, that an elaborated sap moves in the reverse direction in\r\nthe rind; so too he perceives that if bulbs, tubers, and roots, with\r\nor without the help of water which they have absorbed, produce shoots\r\nand even flowers, this must be done at the expense of material laid\r\nup in reserve, but he does not turn this fact to any further account.\r\nBut he utterly spoilt the best part of his subject; he made the leaves\r\nnothing but pumps that suck up the sap from the roots; he quotes\r\nMalpighi’s better view as a curiosity, and never mentions it again; but\r\nhe accepts Bonnet’s unfortunate theory, though he himself adduces many\r\nfacts, which make for Malpighi’s interpretation of the leaves. He is\r\nalmost more unsuccessful with chemical points in nutrition; he repeats\r\nMariotte’s statements with regard to the necessity of a chemical change\r\nin the nutrient substances in the plant, and even supplies further\r\nproof of it; but he cannot shake off the Aristotelian dogma, that\r\nthe earth like an animal stomach elaborates the food of plants, and\r\nthat the roots absorb the elaborated matter like chyle-vessels (II.\r\npp. 189, 230). He concludes from his own attempts to grow land-plants\r\nwithout earth and in ordinary water that the latter supplies the plant\r\nwith very little matter in solution, but he makes no use of Hales’\r\nstatements with regard to the co-operation of the air in the building\r\nup of the plant, and ends by saying (II. p. 204) that he only wished to\r\nprove that the purest and simplest water can supply plants with their\r\nfood, which his experiments do not prove. Thus almost all that Du Hamel\r\nsays on the nutrition of plants is a mixture of right observations\r\nin detail with wrong conclusions, and reflections which never rise\r\nabove the individual facts and give no account of the connection of\r\nthe whole. These faults appear in a still higher degree in a later\r\nand almost more comprehensive work, the ‘Traité théorique et pratique\r\nde la végétation’ of Mustel (1781). The further the distance from the\r\nfounders of vegetable physiology, the larger were the books that were\r\nwritten on the subject; but the thread that held the single facts\r\ntogether became thinner and thinner, till at last it broke. The theory\r\nof nutrition, like a forced plant, needed light that it might recover\r\nstrength. This light came with the discoveries of Ingen-Houss, and\r\nwith the mighty strides made by chemistry after 1760 in the hands of\r\nLavoisier.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE MODERN THEORY OF NUTRITION FOUNDED BY INGEN-HOUSS AND THEODORE\r\nDE SAUSSURE. 1779-1804.\r\n\r\nThe two cardinal points in the doctrine of the nutrition of plants,\r\nnamely that the leaves are the organs which elaborate the food, and\r\nthat a large part of the substance of the plant is derived from the\r\natmosphere, were established, as we have seen, by Malpighi and Hales,\r\nand employed by them in framing their theory; it remained to supply a\r\ndirect and tangible proof of the fact that the green leaves take up a\r\nconstituent of the atmosphere and apply it to purposes of nutrition. It\r\nwas evidently the want of such direct proof which caused the successors\r\nof the first great physiologists to overlook the importance of the\r\npropositions thus obtained by deduction, and so to grope their way in\r\nthe dark with no principle to guide them.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Priestley, Ingen-Houss and Senebier, and the\r\nquantitative determinations of de Saussure in the years between 1774\r\nand 1804, supplied the proof that the green parts of plants, and the\r\nleaves therefore especially, take up and decompose a constituent of\r\nthe air, while they at the same time assimilate the constituents of\r\nwater and increase in weight in a corresponding degree; but that this\r\nprocess only goes on copiously and in the normal way, when small\r\nquantities of mineral matter are introduced at the same time into\r\nthe plant through the roots. The discoveries and facts, from which\r\nthis doctrine proceeded, were those which overthrew the theory of\r\nthe phlogiston, and from which Lavoisier deduced the principles of\r\nmodern chemistry; the new theory of the nutrition of plants was indeed\r\ndirectly due to Lavoisier’s doctrines, and it is necessary therefore\r\nto take at least a hasty glance at the revolution which was effected\r\nin chemistry between 1770 and 1790. It is a well-known fact[130] that\r\nthis revolution dates from the discovery of oxygen-gas by Priestley in\r\n1774. Priestley himself was and continued to be a stubborn adherent of\r\nthe phlogiston; but his discovery was made by Lavoisier the basis of an\r\nentirely new view of chemical processes. By the combustion of charcoal\r\nand the diamond, Lavoisier proved as early as 1776 that ‘fixed air’\r\nwas a compound of carbon and ‘vital air.’ In like manner phosphoric\r\nacid, sulphuric acid and, after a preliminary discovery by Cavendish,\r\nnitric acid also were found to be compounds of phosphorus, sulphur\r\nand nitrogen with vital air; in 1777 Lavoisier showed that fixed air\r\nand water are produced by the combustion of organic substances, and\r\nafter establishing within certain limits the quantitative composition\r\nof fixed air, he named it carbonic acid, and the gas which had up\r\nto that time been known as vital air he called oxygen. Cavendish\r\nin 1783 obtained water by the combustion of hydrogen-gas, and then\r\nLavoisier proved that water is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen. These\r\ndiscoveries not only did away step by step with the old theory of the\r\nphlogiston, and supplied the principles of modern chemistry, but they\r\nalso affected exactly those substances which play the most important\r\npart in the nutrition of plants; every one of these discoveries in\r\nchemistry could at once be turned to account in physiology. In 1779\r\nPRIESTLEY discovered that the green parts of plants occasionally\r\nexhale oxygen, and in the same year Ingen-Houss described some fuller\r\ninvestigations, which showed that this only takes place under the\r\ninfluence of light, and that the green parts of plants give off carbon\r\ndioxide in the dark, as those parts which are not green do both in\r\nthe light and the dark. A correct interpretation of these facts was\r\nnot however possible in 1779; it was not till 1785 that Lavoisier\r\nsucceeded in setting himself quite free from the old notions, and\r\ndeveloped his antiphlogistic system into a connected whole. It should\r\nbe mentioned that he had discovered in 1777 that the respiration of\r\nanimals is a process of oxidation which produces their internal heat,\r\nheat being the product of every form of combustion. This fact was\r\nequally important for vegetable physiology, but it was some time before\r\nit was used to explain the life of plants.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the fact, that parts of plants give off oxygen\r\nunder certain circumstances, did little or nothing to further the\r\ntheory of their nutrition[131]; and that was all that vegetable\r\nphysiology owes to Priestley. Ingen-Houss on the other hand determined\r\nthe conditions under which oxygen is given off, and further showed that\r\nall parts of plants are constantly giving rise to carbon dioxide; on\r\nthese facts rests the modern theory of the nutrition and respiration of\r\nplants, and we must therefore consider that Ingen-Houss was the founder\r\nof that theory. But since we are dealing here with a discovery of more\r\nthan ordinary importance, it seems necessary to go more closely into\r\nthe details.\r\n\r\nA work of Priestley’s appeared in 1779, which was translated\r\ninto German in the following year under the title, ‘Versuche und\r\nBeobachtungen über verschiedene Theile der Naturlehre,’ and contained\r\namong other things the writer’s experiments on plants. His way of\r\nmanaging them was eminently unsuitable, nor did he arrive at any\r\ndefinite and important result, though he expressed the idea which\r\nhad led him to make them clearly enough, where he says, ‘If the air\r\nexhaled by the plant is of better character (richer in oxygen) than\r\natmospheric air, it follows that the phlogiston of the air is retained\r\nin the plant and used there for its nourishment, while the part which\r\nescapes, being deprived of its phlogiston, necessarily attains a higher\r\ndegree of purity.’ After he had ceased his experiments with plants in\r\n1778, he observed that there was a deposit of matter in the water in\r\nsome vessels which he had used for them, and that it gave off a very\r\n‘pure air’; a number of further observations taught him that this\r\nair was given off only under the influence of sun-light; Priestley\r\nhimself did not suspect that the deposit in question, afterwards known\r\nas Priestley’s matter and found to consist of Algae, was a vegetable\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nIn the same year (1779) appeared the first book by INGEN-HOUSS[132], in\r\nwhich the subject was treated at length; it was called, ‘Experiments\r\non Vegetables, discovering their great power of purifying the common\r\nair in the sunshine and of injuring it in the shade and at night,’\r\nand was at once translated into German, Dutch and French. The title\r\nitself shows that the author had observed more and more correctly\r\nthan Priestley. But he did not come to an understanding of the\r\ninner connection of the facts, till Lavoisier completed his new\r\nantiphlogistic theory. He says himself in his essay, ‘On the nutrition\r\nof plants and the fruitfulness of the earth,’ which appeared in 1796,\r\nand was translated into German with an introduction by A. v. Humboldt\r\nin 1798, that when he published his discoveries in 1779, the new system\r\nof chemistry was not yet fully declared, and that without its aid he\r\nhad been unable to deduce the true theory from the facts; but that\r\nsince the composition of water and air had been discovered, it had\r\nbecome much easier to explain the phenomena of vegetation. But in order\r\nto establish his priority he says on p. 56, that he had been fortunate\r\nenough to find out the real cause why plants at certain times vitiate\r\nthe surrounding air, a cause which neither Priestley nor Scheele had\r\nsuspected. He had discovered, he says, in the summer of 1779, that\r\nall vegetables incessantly give out carbonic acid gas, but that the\r\ngreen leaves and shoots only exhale oxygen in sun-light or clear\r\ndaylight. It appears therefore that Ingen-Houss not only discovered the\r\nassimilation of carbon and the true respiration of plants, but also\r\nkept the conditions and the meaning of the two phenomena distinct from\r\none another. Accordingly he had a clear idea of the great distinction\r\nbetween the nutrition of germinating plants and of older green ones,\r\nthe independence of the one, the dependence of the other, on light;\r\nand that he considered the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere to be the\r\nmain if not the only source of the carbon in the plant, is shown by\r\nhis remark on a foolish assertion of Hassenfratz that the carbon is\r\ntaken from the earth by the roots; he replied that it was scarcely\r\nconceivable that a large tree should in that case find its food for\r\nhundreds of years in the same spot. There was a certain boldness in\r\nthese utterances of Ingen-Houss, and a considerable confidence in\r\nhis own convictions, for at that time the absolute amount of carbon\r\ndioxide in the air had not been ascertained, and the small quantity of\r\nit in proportion to the other constituents of air would certainly have\r\ndeterred some persons from seeing in it the supply of the huge masses\r\nof carbon which plants accumulate in their structures.\r\n\r\nBefore Ingen-Houss in the work last mentioned explained the results\r\nof his observations of 1779 in accordance with the new chemical\r\nviews, and laid the foundations of the doctrine of nutrition in\r\nplants, JEAN SENEBIER[133], of Geneva, made protracted researches\r\ninto the influence of light on vegetation (1782-1788), and founded\r\non their results a theory of nutrition, which he published in 1800\r\nin a tediously prolix work in five volumes entitled, ‘Physiologie\r\nvégétale.’ In this work some valuable matter was concealed in a host of\r\nunimportant details and tiresome displays of rhetoric, which for the\r\nmost part are beside the question. But it must be acknowledged that\r\nSenebier was better provided with chemical knowledge than Ingen-Houss,\r\nand that he brought together all the scattered facts that the chemical\r\nliterature of the day offered, in order to obtain a more complete\r\nrepresentation of the processes of nutrition. It was of especial\r\nimportance at that time to insist on the principle that the processes\r\nof nutrition within the plant must be judged by the general laws of\r\nchemistry; organised beings, said Senebier, are the stage, on which\r\nthe affinities of the constituents of earth, water, and air mutually\r\ninfluence each other; the decompositions however are generally the\r\nresult of the influence of light, which separates the oxygen of the\r\ncarbon dioxide in the green parts of plants. He insists (II. p. 304)\r\nupon this among other facts, that the simple constituents of all plants\r\nare the same, and the differences are only quantitative. He then brings\r\nbefore us the simple and compound constituents of plants one after the\r\nother, and among them light and heat figure as material substances,\r\nin accordance with the view of the time. He treats at great length\r\nthe old question of the meaning of the salts in the plant, and it is\r\ninstructive to observe how he tries to decide whether the nitrates,\r\nsulphates and ammonia, which are found in the sap of plants, are\r\nintroduced from without, or are formed in them from their constituent\r\nelements; he concludes finally that the former is the more probable\r\nopinion. That the greater part at least of the carbon of plants comes\r\nfrom the atmosphere could scarcely be a matter of doubt with those\r\nwho knew the writings of Ingen-Houss; but Senebier devotes special\r\nattention to this question; he endeavours to take all the co-operating\r\nfactors into the calculation, and especially to prove once more that\r\nthe oxygen given off from the plant in light comes from the carbon\r\ndioxide which has been absorbed, that the green parts only and no\r\nothers are able to effect this decomposition, and that there is a\r\nsufficiency of carbon dioxide in nature to supply the food of plants.\r\nBut although he convinced himself that green leaves decompose the\r\ncarbon dioxide which surrounds them in a gaseous form, he supposed that\r\nit is chiefly through the roots that this substance finds its way with\r\nthe ascending sap into the leaves, and this view often gave occasion to\r\nfurther error in later writers.\r\n\r\nThe tedious prolixity of Senebier’s book was one reason why it never\r\nenjoyed the measure of appreciation and influence which it deserved;\r\nbut it was also thrown into the shade by the appearance of a work of\r\nsuperior excellence, distinguished at once by the importance of its\r\ncontents, by condensation of style, and by perspicuity of thought.\r\nThis work was the ‘Recherches chimiques sur la végétation’ of THÉODORE\r\nDE SAUSSURE[134] (1804), which contained new observations and new\r\nresults, and what was still more important, a new method. Saussure\r\nadopted for the most part the quantitative mode of dealing with\r\nquestions of nutrition; and as the questions which he put were thus\r\nrendered more definite, and his experiments were conducted in a most\r\nmasterly manner, he succeeded in obtaining definite answers. He knew\r\nhow to manage his experiments in such a manner that the results were\r\nsure to speak plainly for themselves; they had not to be brought out\r\nby laborious calculation from those small and, as they are called,\r\nexact data, which less skilful experimenters use to hide their own\r\nuncertainty. The directness and brevity with which precise quantitative\r\nresults are expressed, the close reasoning and transparent clearness\r\nof thought, impart to the reader of de Saussure’s works a feeling\r\nof confidence and security such as he receives from scarcely any\r\nother writer on these subjects from the time of Hales to our own.\r\nThe ‘Recherches chimiques’ have this in common with Hales’ ‘Statical\r\nEssays,’ that the statements of facts which they contain have been\r\nmade use of again and again by later writers for theoretical purposes,\r\nwhile the theoretical connexion between them was constantly overlooked,\r\nas we shall have reason to learn in the following section. It is not\r\nevery one who can follow a work like this, which is no connected\r\ndidactic exposition of the theory of nutrition, but a series of\r\nexperimental results which group themselves round the great questions\r\nof the subject, while the theoretical connection is indicated in short\r\nintroductions and recapitulations, and it is left to the reader to form\r\nhis own convictions by careful study of all the details. It was not de\r\nSaussure’s intention to teach the science, but to lay its foundations;\r\nnot to communicate facts, but to establish them; the style therefore,\r\nas might be expected, is dry and unattractive; the writer seems to\r\nconfine himself too anxiously within the limits of what is given in\r\nexperience, and there is no doubt that many errors in later times might\r\nhave been avoided if the inductive proof of de Saussure’s doctrines had\r\nbeen accompanied with a deductive exposition of them of a more didactic\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe processes of vegetation examined by de Saussure were, for the most\r\npart, the same as those which Ingen-Houss and Senebier had studied\r\nat length and correctly described in their general outlines. But de\r\nSaussure went beyond this, and by means of quantitative determinations\r\nstruck a balance between the amount of matter taken up and given off\r\nby the plant, thereby showing what it retains. In this way he made two\r\ngreat discoveries: that the elements of water are fixed in the plant\r\nat the same time as the carbon, and that there is no normal nutrition\r\nof the plant without the introduction of nitrates and mineral matter.\r\nBut we cannot form a due idea of de Saussure’s services to physiology\r\nwithout going further into the detail of his work.\r\n\r\nWe will first consider his investigations respecting the assimilation\r\nof carbon in plants. Here we have the important result, that larger\r\nquantities of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere surrounding the plants\r\nare only favourable to vegetation if the latter are in a condition to\r\ndecompose them, that is, if they are in sufficiently strong light; that\r\nevery increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the air in shade or\r\nin darkness is unfavourable to vegetation, and that if that increase is\r\ngreater than eight times in the hundred it is absolutely injurious. On\r\nthe other hand he found, that the decomposition of carbon dioxide by\r\nthe green parts in light is an occupation that is necessary to them,\r\nthat plants die when they are deprived of it. The first clear insight\r\ninto the chemical processes which accompany the decomposition of carbon\r\ndioxide in the interior of the plant was obtained by perceiving, that\r\nplants by appropriating a definite quantity of carbon make a much\r\nmore than proportionate addition to their dry substance, and that this\r\nis due to the simultaneous fixation of the component parts of water.\r\nThe full significance of this fact could only be apprehended at a\r\nlater time, when the theory of the combinations of carbon, organic\r\nchemistry, had been further developed. As regards the importance of the\r\ndecomposition of carbon dioxide by the green organs under the influence\r\nof light to the whole nourishment of the plant, de Saussure arrived\r\nby more definite proofs than Ingen-Houss had given at the result,\r\nthat only a small portion of the substance of plants is derived from\r\nthe constituents of the soil in solution in water, but that the great\r\nmass of the vegetable body is built up from the carbon dioxide of the\r\natmosphere and the constituents of water; he convinced himself of this\r\npartly by considering the small quantities of matter which the water is\r\nable to dissolve from a soil capable of sustaining vegetation, partly\r\nby experiments in vegetation and considerations of a more general\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nNot less important were de Saussure’s investigations into\r\noxygen-respiration by plants, which taken simply as a fact, had been\r\npreviously discovered by Ingen-Houss. But de Saussure showed that\r\ngrowth is impossible without this process of respiration, even in\r\ngerminating plants, though these are rich in assimilated matter. He\r\nfurther showed that green leaves and opening flowers, and generally\r\nthe parts of plants which are distinguished by greater activity of\r\nvital processes, require more oxygen for respiration than those in a\r\nless active and resting state. He determined the loss of weight which\r\nthe organic substance of germinating plants suffers from respiration,\r\nand found it to be greater than was proportionate to the weight of\r\ncarbon exhaled; but the chemical science of his day did not supply\r\nhim with a certain explanation of this fact. Lastly, de Saussure at a\r\nlater time (1822) discovered the chief relations between the internal\r\nheat of flowers and their consumption of oxygen, and thus we see that\r\nhe supplied the most important elements in the modern theory of the\r\nrespiration of plants, though he did not fully explain their mutual\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nIt evidently was the received opinion before the time of Ingen-Houss,\r\nand in spite of Hales’ views, that plants derive the larger part of\r\ntheir food from the constituents of earth and water. But when it became\r\nknown that the carbon, which is the chief constituent of vegetable\r\nsubstance, comes from the atmosphere, and it was considered that much\r\nthe larger part of that substance is combustible, it naturally became\r\na question whether the incombustible ingredients which form the ash\r\ntake any part in the nutrition of plants. This question was by many\r\nphysiologists answered in the negative; but de Saussure maintained\r\nthe contrary view. He insisted that certain ingredients, which are\r\nfound in the ash of all plants, must not be regarded as accidental\r\nadmixtures, and that the small quantities in which they occur are no\r\nproof that they are not indispensable; and he showed from a large\r\nnumber of analyses of vegetable ash, which for a long time were\r\nunsurpassed in excellence, that there are certain relations between\r\nthe presence of certain substances in the ash and the condition of\r\ndevelopment of the organs of the plant; for instance, he found that\r\nyoung parts of plants capable of development were rich in alkalies and\r\nphosphoric acid, while older and inactive portions were richest in\r\nlime and silicic acid. Still more important were the experiments in\r\nvegetation, by which he showed that plants, whose roots grow not in\r\nearth but in distilled water, only take up as much ash-constituents as\r\ncorresponds with the particles of dust which fall into the water; and\r\nfurther, that the increase in the organic combustible substance of a\r\nplant so grown is very insignificant, and consequently that there is\r\nno normal vegetation where the plant does not take up ash-constituents\r\nin sufficient quantity,—a result of the highest importance to the main\r\nquestion. Unfortunately de Saussure neglected to state these results\r\nwith due emphasis and to point out their fundamental importance, and\r\nconsequently doubts were entertained even till after 1830 respecting\r\nthe necessity of the constituents of the ash to vegetation.\r\n\r\nIt was known in de Saussure’s time that nitrogen entered into the\r\nsubstance of living plants; the question was, whence it was obtained.\r\nAs it was known that four-fifths of the atmosphere consists of\r\nnitrogen, it was natural to suppose that it is this which the plant\r\nmakes use of for forming its nitrogenous substance. De Saussure\r\nendeavoured to settle the question by the volumetric method, which,\r\nas was afterwards discovered, was not in this case to be trusted.\r\nNevertheless he arrived at the right conclusion, that plants do not\r\nassimilate the nitrogen of the atmosphere; this gas must therefore be\r\ntaken up by the roots in some form of chemical combination. He made\r\nno experiments on growing plants to decide what that form was, but\r\ncontented himself with the conjecture that vegetable and animal matter\r\nin the soil and ammoniacal exhalations from it supply the nitrogen in\r\nplants. This question, first ventilated certainly by de Saussure, and\r\nafterwards the subject of protracted discussion, was finally settled\r\nfifty years later by the experiments of Boussingault.\r\n\r\nIn connection with his researches into the importance of the\r\nconstituents of the ash, de Saussure proposed the question whether\r\nroots take up the solutions of salts and other substances exactly in\r\nthe form in which they offer themselves. He found first of all that\r\nvery various and even poisonous matters are absorbed by them, and\r\nthat there is therefore no such power of choice, as Jung had once\r\nsupposed; on the other hand, it appeared that the solutions do not\r\nenter unchanged into the roots, for in his experiments in every case\r\nthe proportion of water to the salt absorbed was greater than the\r\nproportion between them in the solution, and that some salts enter the\r\nplant in larger, some in smaller quantities, under circumstances in\r\nother respects the same. But at this time, and for a long time after,\r\nit was not possible to understand and rightly explain these facts; the\r\ntheory of diffusions was not yet known, and fifty or sixty years were\r\nto elapse before light was thrown on the questions thus raised by de\r\nSaussure.\r\n\r\nSuch were the most important contents of de Saussure’s publication\r\nin 1804. His later contributions to the knowledge of some important\r\nquestions in vegetable physiology will be mentioned further on. A\r\ncomparison of the contents of the ‘Recherches chimiques’ with what\r\nwas known of the chemistry of the food of plants before 1780 excites\r\nthe liveliest astonishment at the enormous advance made in these\r\ntwenty-four years. The latter years of the 18th century had proved\r\nstill more fruitful, if possible, as regards the theory of nutrition\r\nthan the latter years of the 17th; both periods have this in common,\r\nthat they developed an extraordinary abundance of new points of view\r\nin every branch of botanical science. They resemble each other also in\r\nthe circumstance that they were both followed by a longer period of\r\ninactivity; the time from Hales to Ingen-Houss was highly unproductive,\r\nand so also were the thirty years that followed the appearance of de\r\nSaussure’s great work, though it must be admitted that some good work\r\nwas done during that period in France, while in Germany the new theory\r\nwas grossly misunderstood by the chief representatives of botany, as we\r\nshall see in the following section. It should be mentioned however that\r\none of these misconceptions, which was not removed till after 1860, was\r\ncaused by de Saussure himself. He had observed that the red leaves of a\r\nvariety of the garden Orache disengage oxygen from carbon dioxide, as\r\nmuch as the green leaves of the common kind. In this case he was hasty,\r\nand concluded from this single observation that the green colour is not\r\nan essential character of the parts which decompose carbonic acid; if\r\nhe had only removed the epidermis of the red leaves he would have found\r\nthat the inner tissue is coloured as dark green as the ordinary green\r\nleaves. He who was usually so extremely careful as an observer was for\r\nonce negligent, and later writers, as is apt to happen, fixed exactly\r\non this one weak point, and repeatedly called in question one of the\r\nmost weighty facts of vegetable physiology, namely, that only cells\r\nwhich contain chlorophyll eliminate oxygen.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. VITAL FORCE. RESPIRATION AND HEAT OF PLANTS. ENDOSMOSE. 1804-1840.\r\n\r\nDuring the twenty years that followed the appearance of de Saussure’s\r\nchemical researches the theory of the nutrition of plants can scarcely\r\nbe said to have been advanced in any one direction, while much that\r\nhad already been accomplished was not even understood. Various\r\ncircumstances worked together to introduce misconceptions in this\r\nprovince of botany; above all others the inclination, more strongly\r\npronounced than ever at this period, to attribute to organisms a\r\nspecial vital principle or force, which was supposed to possess a\r\nvariety of wonderful powers, so that it could even produce elementary\r\nsubstances, heat, and other things out of nothing. Whenever any\r\nprocess in such organisms was difficult to explain by physical or\r\nchemical laws, the vital force was simply called in to bring about the\r\nphenomena in question in some inexplicable manner. It was not that the\r\nquestion was now raised, which at a later time engaged the attention\r\nof profounder thinkers, whether there was a special agent operating in\r\norganic bodies beside the general forces which govern inorganic nature;\r\nfor a careful examination of this question would certainly have led\r\nto the most earnest efforts to explain all the phenomena of life by\r\nphysical or chemical laws. On the contrary, it was found convenient to\r\nassume this vital force as proved, and to assign it as the cause of a\r\nvariety of phenomena, thus escaping the necessity of explaining the\r\nway in which the effects were produced; in a word, the assumption of\r\na vital force was not a hypothesis to stimulate investigation, but a\r\nphantom that made all intellectual efforts superfluous.\r\n\r\nAnother hindrance to the progress of physiology, especially where\r\nquestions of nutrition turned on the movement of the sap, was the\r\nbackward condition of the study of the inner structure of plants,\r\nas described in the second book. For instance, the question of\r\nthe descending sap was complicated in the strangest way by Du\r\nPetit-Thouars’s theory of bud-roots that descend between the bark\r\nand the wood; Reichel’s unfounded idea of the rising of the sap in\r\nthe tubes of the wood was generally accepted, and a still worse\r\nerror was maintained by some, that the intercellular spaces of the\r\nparenchyma are true sap-conveying organs. In 1812 Moldenhawer had\r\nto insist, but without producing any general conviction, that the\r\nvessels of the wood contain air, and Treviranus in 1821 that the\r\nstomata serve for the entrance and exit of air. We need not notice\r\nhere what nature-philosophers like Kieser said about nutrition and\r\nthe movement of the sap; but even those who were far from adopting\r\nthe extravagancies of this school were incapable of either making\r\nuse of or carrying on the labours of Ingen-Houss, Senebier, and de\r\nSaussure. We may adduce in proof of this statement the remarks of\r\nLink on the function of leaves in his ‘Grundlehren der Anatomie und\r\nPhysiologie,’ 1807. He says at p. 202 that their function is according\r\nto Hales transpiration, according to Bonnet absorption, according\r\nto Bjerkander the exudation and secretion of a variety of fluids,\r\naccording to Hedwig the storing up of juices, and inasmuch as leaves\r\nincrease the green surfaces of plants, bear stomata and hairs, and\r\nhold a quantity of juices in their abundant parenchyma, we may ascribe\r\nall these functions, but none of them exclusively, to leaves; the only\r\nthing peculiar to them is that they convey elaborated juices to the\r\nyoung parts. Their great work, the decomposition of carbon dioxide, he\r\ndoes not mention. But this neglect of the doctrines of Ingen-Houss,\r\nSenebier, and de Saussure was common, especially in Germany; it is seen\r\nin the efforts made to prove once more the existence of a descending\r\nsap in the rind, just as it had been proved in the two previous\r\ncenturies, by the result of removing a ring of bark from the stem,\r\nand by similar experiments; whereas the simple consideration that it\r\nis only in the green leaves that carbonaceous vegetable substance is\r\nformed, would have made the existence of what was known as a descending\r\nsap appear to be a matter of course, and must have led to a much\r\nclearer conception of the matter. But this consideration was either\r\nquite overlooked or only mentioned incidentally by those who occupied\r\nthemselves with experiments on the movement of the descending sap. This\r\nis the case in Heinrich Cotta’s ‘Naturbeobachtungen über die Bewegung\r\nund Function des Saftes in den Gewächsen,’ 1806, in many respects an\r\ninstructive work, and in Knight’s otherwise serviceable experiments\r\non the growth in thickness of trees. It was not till after 1830 that\r\nDe Candolle and Dutrochet perceived that the fact that the green\r\nleaves are assimilating organs must be decisive of the question of the\r\nmovement of the sap in the stem.\r\n\r\nNo progress was made with the general doctrine of nutrition between\r\n1820 and 1840 except in one point, the absorption of oxygen by all\r\nparts of plants; here something was done to consolidate the theory\r\nand to enrich it with new facts; it was indeed a subject more adapted\r\nto the views of the day, because it at once suggested a variety of\r\nanalogies with the respiration of animals. Grischow showed in 1819\r\nthat Fungi never decompose carbon dioxide, but absorb oxygen and\r\ngive off carbon dioxide. Marcet carried the subject further in 1834,\r\nafter de Saussure had published in 1822 an excellent investigation\r\ninto the absorption of oxygen by flowers; in this work we have the\r\nbasis laid for the theory of vegetable heat, to which we shall\r\nreturn. But Dutrochet was the first who made an elaborate comparison\r\nof the respiration of plants and animals (1837), and showed that\r\nnot only growth, as de Saussure had already perceived, but also the\r\nsensitiveness of plants depends on the presence of oxygen, that is on\r\ntheir respiration. The recognition of the fact, that the inhalation of\r\noxygen plays the same part in plants that it does in animals, prepared\r\nthe way for the view that heat in plants is simply a result of their\r\nrespiration, as it is in animals. It is not necessary to describe at\r\nlength the experiments which were made on heat in plants before 1822;\r\nthey were one and all vitiated by a want of clearness in the statement\r\nof the question, which made success impossible; it was assumed that\r\nthis heat by raising the temperature of the plant would make itself\r\nfelt by surrounding objects, and it was sought for exactly where it is\r\nleast to be found, in the wood, in fruits and tubers, and generally in\r\nresting, inactive parts. Moreover the previous experiments, collected\r\nin Goeppert’s book ‘Ueber die Wärmeentwicklung der Pflanzen,’ 1830,\r\nwere so unskilfully managed that they could not possibly lead to any\r\nresult. Nor could the question whether plants really develope internal\r\nheat, as animals do, be determined by a few cases of active development\r\nof heat in flowers, because an idea was prevalent at the time in\r\nconnection with the theory of a vital force, that flowers as the organs\r\nof reproduction alone possessed the power of generating heat.\r\n\r\nLavoisier had clearly perceived in 1777 that the combustion of\r\nsubstances containing carbon by inhaled oxygen was the source of\r\nanimal heat, and had proved it by experiments. Senebier, who first\r\nobserved the rise of temperature in the inflorescence of Arum by\r\nthe thermometer, had at least suggested in his work on physiology\r\nof 1800 (iii. p. 315) that a vigorous absorption of oxygen might be\r\nthe cause of the phenomenon. Bory de St. Vincent reported in 1804\r\nthat Hubert, the owner of a plantation in Madagascar, had observed\r\namong other things that the air in which the flowering spike of one\r\nof the Aroideae had developed its heat could support neither animal\r\nrespiration nor combustion. These indications were however disregarded,\r\nuntil de Saussure in 1822 proved directly the connection between\r\nthe absorption of oxygen and the rise of temperature in flowers. It\r\nwas however a long time before heat in plants was conceived of as\r\na general fact necessarily connected with their respiration. This\r\nconception would have swept away the whole mass of facts accumulated\r\nby Goeppert in his book of 1830, from which he tried to prove (p. 228)\r\nthat plants at no period of their life possess the power of generating\r\nheat—a view which he retracted however in 1832, when he had observed\r\na rise of temperature in germinating plants, bulbs, tubers, and in\r\ngreen plants, when collected into heaps. How difficult it was for\r\nphysiologists under the dominion of the ‘vital force’ to hold firmly\r\nto the simple principle of natural heat, and not to be led away by\r\nisolated observations, is shown by the expressions of De Candolle in\r\n1835, and still more by those of Treviranus in 1838. It is therefore\r\nrefreshing to see Meyen in his ‘Neues System’ (1838), vol. ii, warmly\r\nasserting this principle, and making the development of heat in plants\r\na necessary consequence of their respiration and of other chemical\r\nprocesses. Meyen himself produced no new observations; but Vrolik\r\nand De Vriese showed by laborious experiments in 1836 and 1839 the\r\ndependence of the generation of heat in the flowers of Aroideae on\r\nthe absorption of oxygen. A higher importance as regards the general\r\nprinciple attaches to the attempt of Dutrochet in 1840 to prove that\r\neven growing shoots generate small quantities of heat, as shown by a\r\nthermo-electric apparatus. Some of the details in these observations\r\nare open to objection; but it cannot be denied that they are based on\r\na clear recognition of the general principle, though they ignore the\r\nconsideration that the generation of heat in plants is not necessarily\r\naccompanied with a rise in temperature, since cooling causes may be\r\nacting at the same time with greater effect. However the doctrine\r\nof the natural heat of plants was in the main established by the\r\nobservations of de Saussure, Vrolik, De Vriese, and Dutrochet, and\r\nby Meyen’s and Dutrochet’s assertion of the principle laid down by\r\nLavoisier, though thirty years elapsed before it became an accepted\r\ntruth in vegetable physiology.\r\n\r\nThe crude idea of a vital force was deprived of one of its chief\r\nsupports when it was recognised that the natural heat of organisms\r\nwas a product of chemical processes induced by respiration, for this\r\nhad been regarded since the time of Aristotle as more peculiarly an\r\neffect of the principle of life. And now another discovery was made,\r\nequally calculated to promote the reference to mechanical principles of\r\nthose general and important phenomena of life which had hitherto been\r\nindolently ascribed to the operation of the vital force. It appears\r\nto be a matter of indifference whether Professor Fischer of Breslau\r\nis or is not to be considered as the true discoverer of endosmose in\r\n1822, for it is certain that it was DUTROCHET[135] who first studied\r\nthe subject with exactness, and above all perceived its extraordinary\r\nvalue for the explanation of certain phenomena in living organisms.\r\nHe repeatedly called attention to this value in the years between\r\n1826 and 1837, and endeavoured to refer a variety of phenomena in\r\nvegetation to this agency. He had first observed the operation of\r\nendosmose in its mechanical effects in living bodies; the escape of\r\nthe zoospores of an aquatic Fungus and the ejection of the sperm from\r\nthe spermathecae of snails first led him to the hypothesis, that the\r\nmore concentrated solutions inclosed in organic membranes exercise\r\nan attraction on surrounding water, which, forcing its way into the\r\ninclosed space, is there able to exert considerable powers of pressure.\r\nTo Dutrochet must always belong the merit of having brought into\r\nnotice this mechanical effect of endosmose and of employing it to\r\nexplain a number of vital phenomena. Many things in which a mechanical\r\nexplanation had not been hitherto thought of could now be traced to a\r\nmechanical principle, the effects of which could be exhibited and more\r\naccurately studied by means of artificial apparatus. Dutrochet rightly\r\nattached a special value to the fact, that all states of tension in\r\nvegetable tissue could be at once explained by endosmose and exosmose,\r\nthough, as so often happens in such matters, he may have extended\r\nhis new principle to cases where it was not applicable, as we shall\r\nsee below. His account of the nature of endosmose itself must now be\r\nconsidered to be obsolete, nor did the mathematician Poisson or the\r\nphysicist Magnus about 1830 succeed in framing a satisfactory theory\r\non the subject. It was discovered in the course of the succeeding\r\ntwenty or thirty years, that the phenomena observed by Dutrochet, and\r\nwhich he called endosmose and exosmose, were only complicated cases of\r\nhydro-diffusion, which with the diffusion of gas forms an important\r\npart of molecular physics. Dutrochet, like his immediate successors,\r\nconducted his investigations into osmose with animal and vegetable\r\nmembranes, the latter being of a complex structure; with these he\r\nalways observed in addition to the endosmotic flow of water into the\r\nmore concentrated solution, an escape of the solution itself, and from\r\nthis he concluded that there must always be two currents in opposite\r\ndirections through the membrane which separates the two fluids, that,\r\nas he expresses it, the endosmose is always accompanied with exosmose.\r\nThis error, which was even developed later into a theory of the\r\nendosmotic equivalent, has had much to do till recently with making it\r\nimpossible or difficult to refer certain phenomena of vegetation to\r\nthe processes of hydro-diffusion. To mention only one case, Schleiden\r\nrightly observed that if endosmose, as Dutrochet understood it, is\r\nthe sole cause why water is absorbed by the roots, there must also\r\nbe a corresponding exosmose at the roots; and this, which was called\r\nroot-discharge, Macaire Prinsep thought he had actually discovered,\r\nand even Liebig firmly believed in its existence till a recent period,\r\nalthough the researches of Wiegman and Polstorff (1842) and later\r\nmore careful investigations showed, that there was no noticeable\r\ndischarge by exosmose to answer to the great quantity of water with\r\nsubstances in solution in it which is taken up by the roots. Again,\r\nDutrochet’s theory of endosmose did not fully explain the way in which\r\nthe several substances which feed the plant find their way into and\r\nare disseminated in it. But notwithstanding these and other defects it\r\ndeserved the greatest consideration, because it gave the first impulse\r\nto the further development of the theory of diffusion, and contained\r\na mechanical principle which might serve to explain very various\r\nphenomena in vegetation as yet unexplained. Dutrochet hastened to apply\r\nit to this purpose, where it was at all possible to do so, and chiefly\r\nin his treatise on the ascending and descending sap (‘Mémoires,’ 1837,\r\ni. p. 365), which was superior to anything which had been written\r\non the movement of the sap in plants in its clear conception of the\r\nquestion and in perspicuity of treatment. It should be especially\r\nmentioned that Dutrochet formed a true estimate of the functions of the\r\nleaves as regards both the ascending and descending sap, and to some\r\nextent pointed out the fault which lies at the bottom of the earlier\r\nexperiments with coloured fluids. After communicating a number of good\r\nobservations on the paths of the ascending and descending sap, and\r\nnoticing particularly that in the vine the vessels of the wood serve\r\nfor the movement of the sap only in spring, when vines bleed, but\r\nthat they are air-passages in summer, when transpiration causes the\r\nmost copious flow of water in the wood, he proceeds to consider the\r\nforces which effect the movement of the ascending sap in the wood both\r\nin spring and summer. He first of all judiciously distinguishes two\r\nthings which had been before always mixed up together, the weeping of\r\nsevered root-stocks and the rise of the sap in the wood in transpiring\r\nplants. The first is caused, he thinks, by impulsion, the other by\r\nattraction; we should now say, that in weeping root-stocks the water\r\nis pressed upwards, in transpiring plants drawn up. He then refers the\r\nphenomenon of impulsion to endosmose in the roots, and without going\r\nmuch into detail as regards the anatomical conditions, he compares\r\na weeping root-stock to his own endosmometer, in the tube of which\r\nthe fluid that has been sucked in rises by endosmose and even flows\r\nover; it is true that no very thorough understanding of the matter\r\nwas gained in this way, but at any rate the principle which was to\r\nexplain it was indicated. He then endeavours to explain the movement\r\nof the water which ascends in the wood of transpiring plants by the\r\naction of endosmose from cell to cell. In this he failed entirely,\r\nas was afterwards perceived; but he succeeded in showing that all\r\nthe mechanical explanations that had been previously attempted were\r\nincorrect, and the whole treatise, though unsatisfactory in its main\r\nresult, contains a great number of ingenious experiments and acute\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Théodore de Saussure, who occupied himself\r\nexclusively with chemical questions in physiology, Dutrochet was the\r\nonly vegetable physiologist in the period between 1820 and 1840 who\r\nstudied all its more important questions thoroughly and experimentally;\r\nhis treatise on the respiration of plants, which has been already\r\nmentioned, is excellent in itself, and was of the greatest importance\r\nat the time it appeared, because it brought the chemical processes in\r\nrespiration, the entrance and exit of the gases, for the first time\r\ninto correct connection with the air-passages in the plant, with the\r\nstomata, the vessels, and the intercellular spaces, and submitted the\r\ncomposition of the air contained in the cavities of plants to careful\r\nexamination. It was the best work on the respiration of plants in\r\nthe year 1837 and for a long time after; and if Dutrochet made the\r\nmistake of regarding the oxygen which is disengaged from the plant\r\nitself in the light as the chief agent in respiration, and the oxygen\r\ndirectly absorbed from the atmosphere as only subsidiary to this, he\r\ncompensated for it by recognising the importance of the fact, that only\r\ncells which contain chlorophyll decompose carbon dioxide, and still\r\nmore by correctly distinguishing between respiration by the absorption\r\nof oxygen and the decomposition of carbonic dioxide in light; these\r\ntwo processes were at that time and afterwards very inappropriately\r\ndistinguished as the diurnal and nocturnal respiration of plants, and\r\nthis misleading expression maintained itself in spite of Garreau’s\r\nprotest in 1851 till after 1860, when a modern German physiologist\r\nsucceeded in establishing the true distinction between respiration and\r\nassimilation in plants. Another mischievous complication arose about\r\n1830 connected with the expression, circulation of the sap; it was\r\nthought that an argument for such a circulation even in the higher\r\nplants was to be found in the ‘circulation of the sap’ (protoplasm) in\r\nthe cells of the Characeae, which had been detected by Corti and more\r\nexactly described by Amici; Dutrochet (Mémoires, I. p. 431) exposed\r\nthis confusion of ideas, and has the merit of refuting at the same time\r\nthe absurd theory of the ‘circulation of the vital sap,’ for which\r\nSchultz-Schultzenstein had received a prize from the Academy of Paris.\r\n\r\nWe shall recur in the next chapter to Dutrochet’s minute investigations\r\ninto the movements connected with irritability in plants, which he\r\nalso endeavoured to refer to endosmotic changes in the turgidity of\r\nthe tissues, but he did not do justice to the anatomical conditions of\r\nthe problem. And here we may take occasion to remark, that Dutrochet’s\r\nworks were often undervalued, especially in Germany, greatly to the\r\ndetriment of vegetable physiology. His younger German contemporaries,\r\nvon Mohl and Schleiden, and at a later time Hofmeister, were right\r\nin pointing out what was erroneous and sometimes arbitrary in his\r\nmechanical explanations of various movements in plants, and it cannot\r\nbe denied that he was sometimes led into obscure and doubtful views,\r\nas for instance when without any apparent connection he regarded the\r\ninhalation of oxygen as a mechanical condition of the rising of the\r\nsap and also of heliotropic curvatures, and that his attempts at\r\nexplanation were not seldom forced and improbable; but all this does\r\nnot prevent it from being true, that an attentive reader will still\r\ngain much instruction from his physiological writings and be excited\r\nby them to examine for himself. Dutrochet was a decidedly able man and\r\nan independent thinker, who it is true was often led astray by his\r\nprejudices, but at the same time manfully protested against the old\r\ntraditional way of dealing with physiological ideas, and substituted\r\ncareful examination both of his own and others’ investigations for\r\nthe accumulation and comfortable retailing of isolated observations\r\nwhich was then the fashion. After de Saussure’s ‘Recherches chimiques’\r\nDutrochet’s ‘Mémoires pour servir a l’histoire anatomique et\r\nphysiologique des végétaux et des animaux,’ 1837, are without doubt\r\nthe best production, which physiological literature has to show in the\r\nlong period from 1804 to 1840. If later botanists, instead of dwelling\r\non his faults, had developed with care and judgment all that was\r\nreally good in his general view of vegetable physiology, this branch\r\nof botanical science would not have declined as it did in the interval\r\nbetween 1840 and 1860. We shall discover the greatness of Dutrochet as\r\na vegetable physiologist by comparing his work above-mentioned with the\r\nbest text-books of the subject of the same time, those of De Candolle,\r\nTreviranus, and Meyen; not one of them comes up to Dutrochet’s Mémoires\r\nin acuteness or depth.\r\n\r\nThe three text-books just mentioned contained little or nothing new\r\neither in facts or ideas on the subject of the nutrition of plants;\r\nall three were rather compilations of what was already known, and\r\ndiffered from each other only in their selection of material and in\r\nthe form which each sought to give to the general theory; but this is\r\na reason why we should take a nearer look at them, that we may learn\r\nhow the spirit and tendencies of the time were reflected in vegetable\r\nphysiology, and made themselves felt particularly in the theory of\r\nnutrition.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle’s work appeared in French in 1832 in two volumes, the\r\nfirst only being devoted to the subject of the nutrition of plants,\r\nand in German in 1833 with many valuable annotations by the translator\r\nRoeper, under the title, ‘Pflanzen-physiologie oder Darstellung der\r\nLebenskräfte und Lebensverrichtungen der Gewächsc.’ It suffers, in\r\ncommon with the other two books we have mentioned on the same subject,\r\nand with the earlier works of Du Hamel, Mustel, and other writers, from\r\na too discursive mode of treatment, which has the effect of burying\r\nthe points of fundamental importance under a huge mass of facts and\r\nstatements from other writers. It contains much that might have been\r\nomitted as obsolete, and much empirical material of a purely chemical\r\nnature, which could not at that time be applied to the purposes of\r\nphysiology. Nevertheless, it deserved the great consideration which\r\nit enjoyed for a long time, especially in Germany, for its author had\r\nundertaken to treat vegetable physiology as a separate and peculiar\r\nbranch of knowledge, not ignoring at the same time its connection with\r\nand dependence on physics, chemistry, phytotomy, and biology proper,\r\nand thus to give a full and complete delineation of vegetable life;\r\nwhereas the best works that had been written since Du Hamel’s time,\r\nespecially on the nutrition of plants, had proceeded from chemists and\r\nphysicists or from plant-growers like Knight and Cotta, who treated\r\nthe subject in a one-sided manner, each from his own point of view,\r\nand made no attempt to give a connected account of all the phenomena\r\nof vegetation. For this reason De Candolle’s ‘Physiologie végétale’ is\r\nthe most important performance that appeared after Du Hamel’s ‘Physique\r\ndes Arbres’; and if we wish to know what progress was made in vegetable\r\nphysiology generrally, and in the doctrine of nutrition particularly,\r\nin the period from 1758 to 1832, we have only to compare the contents\r\nof these two books. That this progress was a considerable one, appears\r\nplainly from a short summary at the end of the first volume of the\r\ngeneral theory of nutrition, as De Candolle himself conceived it; this\r\nsummary will show us at the same time that he aimed rather at giving\r\na clear account of the whole of the internal economy of the plant,\r\nthan at searching into the moving forces, the causes and effects. From\r\nthis he was necessarily withheld by his assumption of a vital force.\r\nHe distinguished four kinds of forces; the force of attraction which\r\nproduces the physical, and that of elective affinity which causes\r\nthe chemical phenomena; then the vital force, the original source of\r\nall physiological, and the soul-force, the cause of all psychical\r\nphenomena. Only the first three of these forces operate in the plant,\r\nand though it is necessary to find out what phenomena in vegetation are\r\ndue to physical or chemical causes, yet the main task of the vegetable\r\nphysiologist is to discern those which proceed from the vital force,\r\nand the chief mark of such phenomena is that they cease with the death\r\nof the plant (p. 6). Of course therefore all the peculiar phenomena of\r\nnutrition, which are manifested only in the living plant, come within\r\nthe domain of the vital force. It must be allowed, however, that De\r\nCandolle has made a very moderate use of the vital force, and confines\r\nhimself wherever he can to physical and chemical explanations; and when\r\nhe has recourse to the vital force, it is owing less to the influence\r\nof his philosophical point of view than to the fact that his account is\r\nbased rather on tradition and information at second hand than on actual\r\nresearch. It is true that De Candolle was perhaps better acquainted\r\nthan any contemporary botanist with the physics and chemistry of his\r\nday, and it is part of his great merit that he should have acquired\r\nso much knowledge on these subjects while engrossed in his splendid\r\nlabours as a systematist and morphologist; but he betrays, at least\r\nin his later years, a want of practice in the study of physics and\r\na want also of the habit of mind which this imparts, and which is\r\nmore important to the physiologist than a knowledge merely of many\r\nfacts. But this defect is still more apparent in Treviranus and Meyen,\r\nwhose works on physiology were published soon after that of the great\r\nsystematist.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle first brings together all the facts in physiology which\r\nhave been discovered from the beginning, not omitting the chemical\r\nresearches of more modern times into the substance of plants, and then\r\ngives a general delineation of the processes of nutrition in the plant:\r\n‘The spongioles (an unfortunate invention of his own which has not\r\nyet disappeared from French books, and plays a great part in Liebig’s\r\nlatest work)—the spongioles of the roots, being actively contractile\r\nand aided by the capillarity and hygroscopic qualities of their tissue,\r\nsuck in the water that surrounds them together with the saline organic\r\nor gaseous substances with which it is laden. By the operation of\r\nan activity which is manifested principally in the contractility of\r\nthe cells and perhaps also of the vessels, and is maintained by the\r\nhygroscopic character and capillarity of the tissue of the plant and\r\nalso by the interspaces produced by exspiration of the air and by other\r\ncauses, the water sucked in by the roots is conducted through the wood\r\nand especially in the intercellular passages to the leaf-like parts,\r\nbeing attracted in a vertical direction by the leaves and in a lateral\r\ndirection by the cellular envelope (cortical parenchyma) at every\r\nperiod of the year, but chiefly in the spring; a considerable part of\r\nit is exhaled all day long through the stomata into the outer air in\r\nthe form of pure water, leaving in the organs in which the evaporation\r\ntakes place all the saline, and especially all the mineral particles\r\nwhich it contained. The crude sap which reaches the leaf-like parts of\r\nthe plant there encounters the sun-light, and by it the carbonic acid\r\ngas held in solution by the sap, whether derived from the water sucked\r\nin by the roots or from the atmospheric air, or being part of that\r\nwhich the oxygen of the air produced with the surplus carbon of the\r\nplant, is decomposed in the day-time; the carbon is fixed in the plant\r\nand the oxygen discharged as gas into the air. The immediate result of\r\nthis operation appears to be the formation of a substance which in its\r\nsimplest and most ordinary state is a kind of gum consisting of one\r\natom of water and one of carbon, and which may be changed with very\r\nlittle alteration into starch, sugar, and lignine, the composition\r\nof which is almost the same. The nutrient sap thus produced descends\r\nduring the night from the leaves to the roots, by way of the rind and\r\nthe alburnum in Exogens, by way of the wood in Endogens. On its way it\r\nfalls in with glands or glandular cells, especially in the rind and\r\nnear the place where it was first formed; these fill themselves with\r\nthe sap and generate special substances in their interior, most of\r\nwhich are of no use in the nutrition of the plant, but are destined\r\neither to be discharged into the outer air or to be conducted to other\r\nparts of the tissue. The sap deposits in its course the food-material,\r\nwhich becoming more or less mixed up with the ascending crude sap in\r\nthe wood, or sucked in with the water which the parenchyma of the\r\nrind draws to itself through the medullary rays, is absorbed by the\r\ncells and chiefly by the roundish or only slightly elongated cells,\r\nand is there further elaborated. This storing up of food-material,\r\nwhich consists chiefly of gum, starch, sugar, perhaps also lignine,\r\nand sometimes fatty oil, takes place copiously in organs appointed for\r\nthe purpose, from which this material is again removed to serve for\r\nthe nourishment of other organs. The water, which rises from the roots\r\nto the leaf-like parts of the plant, reaches them in an almost pure\r\nstate, if it passes quickly through the woody parts, the molecules of\r\nwhich are but slightly soluble. If, on the other hand, the water flows\r\nthrough parts in which there is much roundish cell-tissue filled with\r\nfood-material, it moves more slowly and mixes with this material and\r\ndissolves it; when it is drawn away from these places by the vital\r\nactivity of the growing parts, it reaches them not as pure water but\r\ncharged with nutrient substances. The juices of plants appear to\r\nbe conveyed chiefly through the intercellular passages. The vessels\r\nprobably share in certain cases in these functions, but serve generally\r\nas air-canals. The cells appear to be the really active organs in\r\nnutrition, since decomposition and assimilation of the juices take\r\nplace in them. Cyclosis (of Schultze’s vital sap[136]) is a phenomenon\r\nwhich appears to be closely connected only with the preparation of\r\nthe milky juices, and to be caused by the actively contractile nature\r\nof the cell-walls or of the tubes. Woody and other substances are\r\ndeposited in every cell in different quantities according to their\r\nkinds and the accompanying circumstances, and clothe their walls; the\r\nunequal thickness of the layer so deposited appears according to Hugo\r\nvon Mohl to have given rise to the supposition of perforated cells;\r\nthat is, the parts of the cell-wall that remain transparent appear\r\nunder the microscope as pores. Every cell may be regarded as a body\r\nwhich prepares juices in its interior; but in vascular plants their\r\nactivity stands in such a connection with a complex of organs, that a\r\nsingle cell does not represent the whole organism, as may be said of\r\nthe cells of certain cellular plants, which are all like one another.\r\nThere is no circulation in plants like the circulation in animals, but\r\nthere is an alternating ascent and descent of the crude sap and of the\r\nformative sap which is often mixed with it. Both these phenomena depend\r\nperhaps on the contractile power in cells that are still young, and if\r\nso, this power would be the true vital energy in plants.‘\r\n\r\nWhat is strange to us in De Candolle’s theory of nutrition is due\r\nchiefly to the predominance of the vital force; yet at the same time\r\nit gives the facts in their general connection, and its best feature\r\nis, that the true function of the leaves, the decomposition of carbon\r\ndioxide in light and the production of organisable substance, is made\r\nthe central point of the whole circle of the processes of nutrition.\r\nVery different in this respect were the views of the two most eminent\r\nGerman vegetable physiologists at the close of the period before\r\nus, Treviranus and Meyen, though they are not in accord with one\r\nanother in their general conception of the subject. It may be said\r\nthat all the prejudices and errors, built up on the foundation of the\r\nhypothesis of a vital force during the first thirty years of the 19th\r\ncentury, culminated in Treviranus; while others were already setting\r\nup the mechanical explanation of the phenomena of vegetation as the\r\none object to be attained, Treviranus produced once more the whole\r\nmachinery of the obsolete doctrine of the vital force, and with such\r\neffect, that his ‘Physiologie der Gewächse’ was already obsolete when\r\nit appeared in 1835. The second volume of Meyen’s ‘Neues System der\r\nPflanzenphysiologie’ was a striking contrast to the work of Treviranus;\r\nMeyen endeavours as far as possible to trace back the phenomena of\r\nvegetation to mechanical and chemical causes, though he does not\r\noften succeed in bringing anything to light that is new or of lasting\r\nservice. He, like Treviranus, was deficient in sound training in\r\nchemistry and physics; they did not stand in this respect, as Hales and\r\nMalpighi once did, at the highest point of knowledge of their time. At\r\nthe same time there was a great difference in the way in which each\r\ndealt with the writings of his predecessors; Treviranus, who had done\r\ngood service in former years in phytotomy, was not equal to the task\r\nwhich he had now undertaken; his physiological expositions are marked\r\nby feebleness of thought and by an inability to survey as from a higher\r\nground the connection between the facts; he distrusts all that had been\r\ndone during the previous thirty years, and almost everywhere appeals\r\nto the publications of the 18th century; he lives indeed in the ideas\r\nof the past, without gaining vigour from the forcible reasoning and\r\nfreshness of thought of a Malpighi, a Mariotte, or a Hales. Meyen’s\r\ntreatment of his subject is on the contrary fresh and vigorous; he does\r\nnot disregard the old, but he holds chiefly to the modern conquests\r\nof science; while Treviranus with singular ill-luck constantly\r\noverlooks what is valuable in itself and important in its results,\r\nMeyen generally picks out the best things from the books before him;\r\nTreviranus timidly avoids expressing any view decidedly and maintaining\r\nit; Meyen, amid the multiplicity of the labours which we have already\r\ndescribed, finds no time to arrange his thoughts, is hasty in judgment\r\nand often contradicts himself. But with all these defects, he is still\r\nthe champion of the new tendencies that were being developed, while\r\nTreviranus lives entirely in the past, and shows no trace of the\r\nactively creative spirit which was soon to burst forth so mightily in\r\nevery branch of natural science.\r\n\r\nIf we examine what both these writers have said on the subject of\r\nthe nutrition of plants, we shall find that the difference in their\r\ngeneral views in physiology as described above appears at once in\r\ntheir treatment of the work of suction in the roots, and of the\r\nmeans by which the sap ascends; here in Treviranus the vital force\r\nis everything; it makes the vessels of the wood conduct the juices\r\nfrom the roots into the leaves, with other antiquated notions of the\r\nkind; Meyen on the contrary adopts Dutrochet’s position, and even\r\nrejects De Candolle’s spongioles. Treviranus knows not what to make of\r\nrespiration; Meyen explains it without hesitation as a function that\r\nanswers to respiration in animals, and finds in it the main cause of\r\nthe natural heat which Treviranus derives in the old mystical fashion\r\nfrom the vital force. In one point however they agree, namely, in a\r\ncomplete misconception of the connection between the decomposition of\r\ncarbon dioxide in the leaves and the general nutrition of the plant.\r\nIt is necessary to the understanding of the confusion of ideas which\r\nhad crept at this time into the doctrine of nutrition, and to a right\r\nestimate of the services of Liebig and Boussingault on this point, that\r\nwe should look a little more closely into the chemical part of the\r\ntheory of nutrition in Treviranus and Meyen.\r\n\r\nTreviranus in the introduction to his book repudiated the idea of a\r\nvital force separable from matter, but he was in fact a prisoner\r\nwithin that circle of ideas, and he made a much freer use of the vital\r\nforce than De Candolle; he went even farther than this, and in his want\r\nof chemical experience he hit upon the grossly materialistic notion of\r\na vital matter [I. p. 6]. This vital matter is a half-fluid substance,\r\nwhich may be obtained from all bodies that were once alive by boiling\r\nand by decay; it is formed from other elements, but it is itself the\r\ntrue elementary matter with which alone physiology has to do; it is\r\ncommon to the animal and vegetable kingdom, and is purest when in the\r\nform of mucilage, albumen, and gelatine; that animals and plants alike\r\nconsist of this vital matter explains the circumstance, that plants\r\nserve as food for animals and animals as food for plants. He goes on to\r\nshow that a similar unctuous substance, called by chemists extract of\r\nthe soil, and considered by many of them to be an important ingredient\r\nin the nutrition of plants, is their true and proper food. This extract\r\nof the soil was therefore the vital matter which plants take up; it\r\nwas natural that Treviranus should no longer attribute any importance\r\nto the decomposition of carbon dioxide in the leaves, especially\r\nas he was unable to understand the chemical connection of all that\r\nIngen-Houss, Senebier, and de Saussure had written. He explained the\r\nco-operation of light in the nutrition of plants to be a merely ‘formal\r\ncondition,’ and the salts in solution in the water of the soil were in\r\nhis opinion stimulants for the use of the extremities of the roots,\r\nwhich were thus put into a condition of ‘vital turgescence’; and as the\r\nfunctions of the leaves, such as Malpighi and Hales had conjectured,\r\nand Ingen-Houss, Senebier, and de Saussure had proved it to be, had no\r\nexistence for Treviranus, he made the assimilation of the soil-sap take\r\nplace on its way, as it flowed upwards and downwards through the plant.\r\nWe see that nothing can be conceived more deplorable than this theory\r\nof nutrition; it would have been bad at the end of the 17th century, it\r\nis difficult to believe that it could have been published thirty years\r\nafter de Saussure’s work.\r\n\r\nThere is much in the details of Meyen’s views on the chemical\r\nprocesses in the nutrition of plants that is better than what we find\r\nin Treviranus; it is a great point that he concluded from earlier\r\nexperiments, that the salts which find their way with the water into\r\nthe roots are not merely ‘stimulants’ but food-material, and, as was\r\nbefore said, he explained the respiration of oxygen by plants correctly\r\nin accordance with de Saussure’s observation. But he too stumbled over\r\nthe assimilation of carbon; he, like so many before and after him, was\r\nconfused by the simple fact, that gaseous matter takes part both in the\r\nnutrition and the respiration of the plant; and taking the processes in\r\nboth cases for processes of respiration, he considered the absorption\r\nof oxygen to be the only important and intelligible function, and the\r\ndecomposition of carbon dioxide in light to be a matter of indifference\r\nas regards the internal economy of the plant. Instead of ascertaining\r\nby a simple calculation, whether the apparently small quantity of\r\ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere was perhaps sufficient to supply\r\nvegetation with carbon, he simply declared it to be insufficient,\r\nand because plants will not flourish in barren soil merely by being\r\nsupplied with water containing carbon dioxide, he gave up the\r\nimportance of that gas altogether. He too found the humus-theory, which\r\nhad been constructed by the chemists, more convenient for his purpose,\r\nand like Treviranus derived the whole of the carbon in plants from\r\n‘extract’ of the soil, without any close attention to the facts of the\r\ncase; he refused to believe that the soil is rendered not poorer but\r\nricher in humus by the plants that grow on it. It is obvious then that\r\nthe account given by Treviranus and Meyen of the chemical processes\r\nthat take place in the nutrition of plants, though correct in some of\r\nthe details, could afford no true general view of the processes of\r\nnutrition, because it entirely misconceived the cardinal points in the\r\nwhole theory, namely the source of the carbon, and the co-operation\r\nof light and of the atmosphere; and thus the best results of the\r\nobservations of Ingen-Houss, Senebier, and de Saussure were lost upon\r\nthe German vegetable physiologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. SETTLEMENT OF THE QUESTION OF THE FOOD-MATERIAL OF PLANTS. 1840-1860.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed in the previous section the rise of views during\r\nthe period between 1830 and 1840 which were calculated to make the\r\nhypothesis of a vital force appear superfluous, at least as an\r\nexplanation of certain important phenomena in vegetation; such were\r\nthe referring the natural heat of plants to chemical processes, and\r\nthe movement of the sap to osmose; in the domain of chemistry also,\r\nin which Berzelius had in the year 1827 made the distinction between\r\norganic and inorganic matter to consist in the fact, that the former\r\nis produced under the influence of the vital force, the opinion was\r\nopenly expressed that such an intrusion of the vital principle could\r\nnot be allowed, since organic compounds had been repeatedly produced\r\nfrom inorganic substances by artificial means, and therefore without\r\nits aid. The general tendency of scientific thought was now in fact\r\nunfavourable to the nature-philosophy of former days; it inclined to\r\nfree itself from the obscurity that attended the idea of a vital force,\r\nand to assert the belief, that chemical and physical laws prevail alike\r\noutside and inside all organisms; this idea became an axiom with the\r\nmore eminent representatives of natural science after 1840, and if not\r\nalways expressed in words, was made the basis of all their attempts to\r\nexplain physiological phenomena.\r\n\r\nThus a freer course began to open for the intellectual movement of the\r\ntime even before the year 1840, and strict inductive research, and\r\nabove all the establishment of facts and closer reasoning were now\r\ndemanded in the question of the nutrition of plants, as they were also\r\nin the domain of morphology and phytotomy. But in dealing with the\r\ntheory of nutrition, the first thing required was not the discovery\r\nof new facts so much as the forming a correct appreciation of the\r\ndiscoveries of Ingen-Houss, Senebier, and de Saussure, and clearing\r\naway the misconceptions that had gathered round them. The chief modern\r\nrepresentatives of vegetable physiology, De Candolle, Treviranus, and\r\nMeyen, had increased the difficulty of the task by neglecting to keep\r\nthe several questions of their science, the chemical especially and\r\nthe mechanical, sufficiently distinct from one another. The question,\r\nwhat are the materials which as a rule compose the food of plants,\r\nthough one of the first and most immediate importance, had been very\r\nimperfectly investigated, while attention had been diverted to a\r\nconfused mass of comparatively unimportant matters, and the solution\r\nof that question had been rendered impossible for the time by the\r\nhumus-theory, an invention of chemists and agriculturists, which\r\nTreviranus and others had fitted so readily into the doctrine of a\r\nvital force. To Liebig belongs the merit of removing these difficulties\r\nand all the superfluous matter which had gradually gathered round the\r\nsubject, and of setting forth distinctly the points which had to be\r\nconsidered; this was all that was required to ensure a satisfactory\r\nsolution of the problem, for former observations had supplied an\r\nabundance of empirical material. But some points of minuter detail were\r\nbrought out in the course of his investigations which required new and\r\ncomprehensive experiments, and for these a most capable and successful\r\nobserver was found between 1840 and 1850 in the person of Boussingault.\r\n\r\nBut before we go on to give a fuller account of the work of Liebig and\r\nBoussingault, we may mention a circumstance which serves to indicate\r\nthe character of the revolution in scientific opinion before and after\r\n1840. An anonymous ‘Friend of science’ had put a prize at the disposal\r\nof the Academy of Göttingen for an answer to the questions, ‘whether\r\nthe inorganic elements, which are found in the ashes of plants, are\r\nfound in the plants themselves, in cases where they are not supplied\r\nto them from without; and whether these elements are such essential\r\nconstituents of the vegetable organism, as to be required for its full\r\ndevelopment.’ The first question appears in the present day absurd,\r\nsince it implies the possibility of elementary matter coming into\r\nbeing, and of certain special elements coming into being in the plants\r\nthemselves, an idea however not unfamiliar to the nature-philosophy\r\nand the vital force school. It was easy for Wiegman and Polstorff,\r\nthe authors of the essay that gained the prize (1842), men of the\r\nnew school, to answer the first question in the negative, and indeed\r\ntheir answer to the second question involved a negative answer to the\r\nfirst. The investigations made by Wiegman and Polstorff in connection\r\nwith the subject of the second question were conducted in a thoroughly\r\nintelligent manner, though they set out from the hypothesis that a\r\ncertain quantity of compounds of humic acid, as it was called, must\r\nbe present in the food-mixtures. Their experiments, better adapted to\r\nthe purpose than any previous ones, showed convincingly that it is\r\nnecessary to the normal nutrition of the plant that it should take up\r\nthe constituents of the ash; the observers also took into consideration\r\na number of other questions connected with nutrition, in which however\r\nwe may already sec the influence of Liebig’s book which had come out\r\nduring their investigations.\r\n\r\nThis work was the one entitled ‘Die organische chemie in ihrer\r\nAnwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologie,’ which appeared first in\r\n1840 and was afterwards repeatedly reprinted and enlarged. The name of\r\nthe author, the first chemist of Germany, raised an expectation that\r\nthe questions respecting nutrition would be dealt with otherwise than\r\nthey had hitherto been, and this expectation was more than fulfilled\r\nby the novelty and boldness with which Liebig cleared up the most\r\nimportant points of the theory, seized upon all that was essential\r\nand fundamental, and disregarded the unimportant matter which had\r\nbefore only served to confuse the question. Moreover, he was able\r\nto rest on long-accepted facts in just those points which were the\r\nmost important, and on these he had only to throw the light of his\r\nchemical knowledge to dispel the previous darkness. In accordance with\r\nhis main purpose, which was to apply organic chemistry and vegetable\r\nphysiology to the service of agriculture, Liebig directed the severity\r\nof his criticism first of all against the humus-theory constructed\r\nby chemists and agriculturists and thoughtlessly adopted by various\r\nphysiologists; this was the first thing that must be got rid of, if\r\nthe question was to be answered, of what substances does the food\r\nof plants consist, for the humus-theory was at once incorrect, and\r\nthe product of a want of reflection which overlooked facts which lay\r\nbefore men’s eyes. Liebig showed that what was known as humus is not\r\ndiminished but constantly increased by vegetation, that the quantity\r\nin existence would not suffice for any length of time for the support\r\nof a vigorous vegetation, and that it is not taken up by plants. This\r\nonce established, and Liebig’s calculations left no doubt on the\r\npoint, there remained one source only for the carbon of the plant,\r\nnamely, the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere, with regard to which it\r\nwas shown by a very simple calculation resting on eudiometric results\r\nthat its quantity is sufficient to supply the vegetation of the whole\r\nearth for countless generations. It is true that Liebig in his zeal\r\nwent much too far, when he found something contradictory in the true\r\nrespiration of plants, because it is connected with the elimination of\r\ncarbon dioxide, and simply denied its reality. On the other hand the\r\ntheoretical significance of the fact established by de Saussure, that\r\nthe elements of water are assimilated at the same time as the carbon,\r\nwas now for the first time clearly explained. Liebig was better able to\r\nrealise the importance of this fact for the theory of nutrition than\r\nde Saussure had been. But these weighty points were not the ones which\r\nattracted most attention with the adherents and opponents of Liebig;\r\nthe practical tendency of his book made the discussion, to which it\r\ngave rise especially among chemists and agriculturists, turn rather on\r\nthe question of the source of the nitrogen in the substance of plants.\r\nThe humus-theory had made the nitrogen like the carbon enter the plant\r\nin the form of organic compounds. De Saussure in his great work of 1804\r\nhad named ammonia as a compound of nitrogen which might be taken into\r\nconsideration with others, but he arrived at no definite conclusion.\r\nLiebig, from different points of view and in reliance on his own\r\ninvestigations into the nature of nitrogen and its compounds, arrived\r\nat the result, that ammonia must ultimately be the sole source of the\r\nnitrogen in the plant, and that the ammonia in the atmosphere and in\r\nthe soil is quite sufficient to supply vegetation with the requisite\r\namount of nitrogen just as the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere is\r\nthe sole source of the carbon of the plant; and so he concluded that\r\n‘carbon dioxide, ammonia, and water contain in their elements the\r\nrequisites for the production of all the substances that are in animals\r\nand plants during their life-time. Carbon dioxide, ammonia, and water\r\nare the ultimate products of the chemical process of their putrefaction\r\nand decay.’\r\n\r\nLiebig was less happy, at least as regards his mode of treating the\r\nsubject, in his remarks on the necessity and specific importance of\r\nthe constituents of the ash to the nutrition of plants. Instead of\r\ninsisting on an experimental answer to the question, what constituents\r\nof the ash are absolutely indispensable to the health of one or all\r\nplants, he lost himself in ingenious chemical theories, intended to\r\nshow the operation of inorganic bases in fixing vegetable acids, the\r\nextent to which different bases can replace each other, and similar\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nIt is not requisite for our purpose to follow Liebig in his\r\napplications of his theoretical remarks to agriculture, still less\r\nto occupy ourselves with the sensation and the discussions which his\r\nwork excited among practical and theoretical farmers and agricultural\r\nchemists. The scientific value of Liebig’s considerations on the\r\nnutrition of plants stood out in a purer and more definite form for\r\nthe vegetable physiologists, who turned their attention chiefly to\r\nthe points mentioned above. It is true that Liebig’s work encountered\r\nlively opposition from these men also, and the two foremost\r\nrepresentatives of vegetable physiology at that time, Schleiden and von\r\nMohl, criticised it unsparingly; this was due partly to the deductive\r\nmethod adopted by Liebig, to which botanists were unaccustomed in\r\nphysiological questions, and partly to the derogatory expressions in\r\nwhich he indulged against the vegetable physiologists, whom he held\r\nresponsible with the botanists generally for all the absurdities\r\nconnected with the humus-theory. Von Mohl asked, and justly, whether\r\nde Saussure, Davy, Carl Sprengel, Berzelius and Mulder, the real\r\nfounders of the theory, were botanists. But it was unnecessary for von\r\nMohl, Schleiden and others to feel touched by Liebig’s reproach, at\r\nleast so far as it was addressed to professed physiologists, for they\r\nwere no more physiologists than Davy, Berzelius or Mulder. Professed\r\nvegetable physiologists, official public representatives of vegetable\r\nphysiology there were none, and then as now every one who occupied\r\nhimself occasionally with questions of the kind was called a vegetable\r\nphysiologist. In this way the contest became a dispute about words,\r\nand Liebig, von Mohl and Schleiden lost an excellent opportunity for\r\ninfluencing public opinion in favour of the idea, that it was high\r\ntime to establish public official representatives of so important a\r\nbranch of science, who should devote themselves entirely to it; how\r\ncould it be expected that Professors of botany, who were required\r\nby the government and the public to work for the advancement of\r\nsystematic botany, phytotomy, and medical botany, to give instruction\r\nin these subjects, and to devote a large portion of their time to the\r\nmanagement of botanic gardens, should do much to promote the study of\r\nvegetable physiology, which demands very considerable acquaintance also\r\nwith physics and chemistry? and where were the laboratories and the\r\ninstruments for the serious prosecution of this branch of science? But\r\nthese questions were not raised, and the old state of things remained\r\nfor the time unchanged.\r\n\r\nAs regards the scientific questions at issue between Liebig and von\r\nMohl, Schleiden, and various agricultural chemists, the contest was\r\nchiefly about matters of secondary importance, and among these might\r\nbe included the objection that Liebig knew scarcely anything of the\r\nanatomy of the plant. The main point was, that he had corrected\r\nmistaken views as to the way in which plants are fed, had refuted\r\ngross errors, had shown what was fundamental and essential and what\r\nwas unimportant. Everything that was written on the subject after 1840\r\nshows that he did all this completely; the publications called forth\r\nby the controversy on his book occupied in the main the ground which\r\nLiebig had cleared. Now every body knew all at once what was meant by\r\nthe decompositon of carbon dioxide in the green parts of plants, that\r\nthe constituents of the ash are not mere seasoning to the vegetation,\r\nand the like; firm ground had been won for all, a number of scientific\r\ntruths had become common property for ever; this did not of course make\r\nit less meritorious in others, to test the rest of Liebig’s theories,\r\nor even to correct his great mistake about the respiration of plants,\r\nas was done emphatically by von Mohl.\r\n\r\nIt would not be consistent with the design of this work to go into all\r\nthe details of the discussion excited by the appearance of Liebig’s\r\nbook, into questions for instance respecting the first products\r\nof assimilation in plants, and their further transformations by\r\nmetabolism. Whether the primary use of the basic mineral constituents\r\nis merely to fix the vegetable acids, whether these acids are the\r\nfirst products of assimilation, or whether carbo-hydrates are the\r\nimmediate result of that process, and similar questions, were for some\r\ntime only matter of conjecture, deduction and combination, unsupported\r\nby certain observation obtained by suitable methods; it was not\r\ntill after 1860 that new paths were struck out on these subjects,\r\nand important results achieved. More important at the time for the\r\nadvance of the science was the further examination of the question\r\nrespecting the source of the nitrogen which plants assimilate; it was\r\nthe more necessary that this point should be finally settled, because\r\nLiebig’s deductions still gave room for many doubts, and the first\r\nof vegetable physiologists, de Saussure, in his later days made the\r\nmistake of coming forward in opposition to Liebig as a defender of the\r\nhumus-theory, maintaining (1842) that ammonia or the nitrates are not\r\nthemselves the food-material of plants, but only serve to dissolve\r\nthe humus. Others also found it difficult to give up entirely the\r\nold and favourite doctrine of the humus; though von Mohl and others\r\nacknowledged that the carbon of plants is mainly derived from the\r\natmosphere, yet they thought themselves obliged to assign to the humus,\r\non account of the nitrogen which it contains, a very important share\r\nin promoting vegetation. Under these circumstances it was extremely\r\nfortunate for physiology that BOUSSINGAULT took up the question. He\r\nhad occupied himself before the appearance of Liebig’s book with\r\nexperimental and analytical investigations into germination and\r\nvegetation, and specially into the source of nitrogen in plants. His\r\nexperiments in vegetation in 1837 and 1838 produced no very decisive\r\nresults; but he continued them for some time longer, improving his\r\nmethods of observation from year to year; and between the years 1851\r\nand 1855 he succeeded in establishing with all certainty as the result\r\nof many repeated trials, that plants are not capable of assimilating\r\nthe free nitrogen of the atmosphere, but that a normal and vigorous\r\nvegetation is produced, when they are supplied with nitrogen from the\r\nnitrates in the soil. It appeared also that plants will flourish in\r\na soil from which all trace of organic substance has been removed by\r\nheat, if a nitrate is added to the constituents of the ash; this proves\r\nat the same time that the whole of the carbon in such plants is derived\r\nfrom the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere without the co-operation\r\nof the humus, and that consequently the favourable effect of a soil\r\nrich in humus on vegetation must be due to other causes than those\r\nwhich were assumed by the humus-theory. We cannot describe the further\r\nservices rendered by Boussingault to the theory of nutrition, for this\r\nwould take us too much into technical details, and the best and most\r\nimportant of his results were first given to the world after 1860,\r\nand do not fall therefore within the limits of this history. But it\r\nshould be mentioned that Boussingault must be considered the founder\r\nof modern methods of conducting experiments in vegetation. Liebig had\r\nbefore spoken in terms of sufficient severity of the miserable way\r\nin which experiments on the subject of the nutrition of plants were\r\nmanaged after de Saussure’s time till later than 1830, but he did not\r\nhimself introduce better methods; this was reserved for Boussingault.\r\nOne instance may be given; those who desired to decide the question of\r\nthe humus by experiment, such as Hartig in conjunction with Liebig and\r\nothers, generally adopted the plan of supplying plants with compounds\r\nof humus-acid, and seeing what would be the result. Boussingault did\r\nas Columbus with the egg; he simply made plants supply themselves\r\nwith food in a soil artificially deprived of all trace of humus and\r\ncontaining a mixture of food-material, in order to prove beyond\r\nquestion that they do not need humus.\r\n\r\nIn Germany also Prince Salm-Horstmar made similar experiments to\r\nthose of Boussingault; he occupied himself chiefly in determining the\r\nrelative importance of the acids and bases of the ash in the nutrition\r\nof plants, whether any and which of them are indispensable; these are\r\nquestions which approached their solution only after 1860, and some are\r\nnot yet decided.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the facts, that plants containing chlorophyll\r\nderive the whole of their carbon from the carbon dioxide of the\r\natmosphere, and that the latter is also the original source of the\r\ncarbon in plants and animals which do not contain chlorophyll; further\r\nthat the nitrogen which plants assimilate is derived from ammoniacal\r\nsalts or nitrates, and that the alkalies, alkaline earths in the form\r\nof sulphates and phosphates, are indispensable ingredients in the food\r\nof plants, must be considered to be the great results of the labour\r\nbestowed on the theory of nutrition in the period from 1840 to 1860,\r\nwhile the way was also prepared for many points, which were afterwards\r\nof the first importance in the enquiry.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the advance made in the theory of the movement of\r\nthe sap from the time of Dutrochet till nearly 1860 was so small as\r\nto be scarcely worth mentioning; yet it was an advance, that the\r\nphysiological value of the doctrine of endosmose was more and more\r\nhighly estimated, and that more solid proofs of the theory itself\r\nand a more exact acquaintance with osmotic processes were making it\r\npossible to explain more of the details of the movement of material\r\nin the plant, though the whole question was far from being finally\r\nsettled. One discovery must be specially mentioned, the establishment\r\nby Hofmeister in 1857 of the fact, that the phenomenon observed for\r\ncenturies in the grape-vine and other trees, and more recently in Agave\r\nand in many tropical climbing plants, known by the name of bleeding or\r\nweeping and supposed to be confined to certain periods of vegetation,\r\nnot only occurs in all plants with true woody cells, but may be\r\nproduced in them at all times by suitable means. The knowledge of this\r\nfact was an aid to the investigation of the cause of the weeping.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the descending sap was in the least advanced condition\r\nduring this period; appeal was still made to experiments of the kind\r\nwhich Malpighi, Du Hamel, and Cotta had made, and which in reality show\r\nnothing more than that in dicotyledonous woody plants a food elaborated\r\nin the leaves is carried downwards through the cortex. As soon as it\r\nwas understood, that all organic substance originates in the leaves, a\r\nfact which no one could doubt after 1840, no experiment was required\r\nto prove that the formative matter necessary for the growth of the\r\nroots, buds, and fruit, must be conducted to those parts from the\r\nleaves. It could no longer be a question whether such a movement of\r\nassimilated material takes place; it remained only to consider what are\r\nthe conducting tissues, and what is the nature of the substances which\r\nare produced in the leaves and conducted to the rest of the organs.\r\nBoth questions in accordance with the organisation of the plant could\r\nbe properly answered only by microchemical methods, and these were not\r\nadopted and further developed till after 1857. We have already said\r\nthat nothing certain was known even as late as 1860 about the chemical\r\ncombinations formed by assimilation in the leaves; De Candolle supposed\r\nthat the primary formative sap was a gum-like substance, from which\r\nthe rest of the various vegetable substances were secreted in the\r\ndifferent tissues. Theodor Hartig, who had done good service between\r\n1850 and 1860 by his investigations into the starch in the wood of\r\ntrees and into proteid in seeds, by the discovery of sieve-tubes, by\r\nobservations on the amount of water in woods at different times of the\r\nyear, and by other contributions to botanical science, also occupied\r\nhimself with the subject of the descending sap, which he conceived of\r\nas a formless primary mucilage, from which, as from De Candolle’s gum,\r\nthe various substances in the plant were deposited as it travelled\r\nthrough the plant. He says (‘Botanische Zeitung’ for 1858, p. 341),\r\n‘The crude sap is changed in the leaves into primitive formative sap,’\r\nand ‘the formation of solid reserve-material (from this) involves\r\nthe elimination of large quantities of watery fluid.’ The occasional\r\nremarks of vegetable physiologists of all sorts between 1840 and\r\n1860 prove, that similar ideas respecting the formation of a primary\r\nmucilage of this kind in the leaves were generally entertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE MOVEMENTS OF PLANTS (PHYTODYNAMICS).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will scarcely be doubted at the present day, that the mechanical\r\nlaws of growth, of geotropic and heliotropic curvatures, of the\r\nvarious kinds of periodic movements, of the twining of tendrils\r\nand climbing plants, and of movements dependent on irritation, may\r\nbe referred to a common principle, and that in all these movements\r\nbesides the elasticity of the cell-walls the still unknown qualities\r\nof the protoplasm play the most important part, and that consequently\r\nthe ‘streamings’ of the protoplasm, the movements of swarmspores and\r\nsimilar occurrences must be ranked with these phytodynamical phenomena.\r\nFrom this point of view phytodynamics would appear to be one of the\r\nmost important foundations of vegetable physiology. The recognition of\r\nthis fact is however of very recent date, and to imagine that such a\r\nconception of the movements of plants was present to the minds of the\r\nearly physiologists would be to attribute to the past ideas to which\r\nit was entirely a stranger. These movements were scarcely noticed even\r\nas curiosities in former ages, and it was not till the end of the 17th\r\ncentury that some attention began to be paid to them; and very slow\r\nprogress was made at a later time in disentangling the relations which\r\ncome under consideration and which are some of them very complicated,\r\nin determining the dependence of the phenomena on external influences,\r\nand explaining to some extent their mechanical conditions.\r\n\r\nSingle movements of parts of plants are noticed in a cursory manner by\r\nsome early writers. Varro was the first who mentioned the heliotropic\r\nmovements of the stalks of many flowers, which he says were for that\r\nreason called heliotropic flowers; in the following century Pliny\r\nsays that the leaves of clover close when bad weather is approaching;\r\nAlbertus Magnus in the 13th century, Valerius Cordus and Garcias del\r\nHuerto in the 16th, thought the daily periodical movements of the\r\npinnate leaves of some Leguminosae worth recording; Cesalpino noticed\r\nthe movements of tendrils and climbing plants, and was surprised to\r\nsee that the latter to some extent seek for their supports. These were\r\nevery-day phenomena, but the striking sensitiveness of the leaves\r\nof Mimosa pudica introduced from America could not fail to attract\r\nattention, and so we find an essay on the causes of it in Robert\r\nHooke’s ‘Micrographia’ of 1667. The irritability of the stamens of\r\nCentaurea had been already mentioned by Borelli in 1653.\r\n\r\n1. We meet with the first speculations on the subject at the end of\r\nthe 17th century. Ray in his ‘Historia Plantarum’ (1693) commences\r\nhis general considerations on the nature of the plant with a succinct\r\naccount of phytodynamical phenomena, and introduces the whole by a\r\nsentence of Jung: ‘Planta est corpus vivens non sentiens,’ etc. Though\r\nRay, like Cesalpino, seems to believe in the Aristotelian soul of\r\nplants, yet he does on the whole endeavour to explain the movements\r\nwhich he describes by physical and mechanical laws; he thinks that\r\nthe irritability of Mimosa in particular is not due to sensation,\r\nbut to known physical causes; the movement of the leaf when it is\r\ntouched is caused by a contraction, which again is due to a withering\r\nor relaxation of its parts. He endeavours to apply the knowledge\r\nof his time to the explanation of the mechanical process: leaves,\r\nhe says, remain tense only because the loss by evaporation is kept\r\nconstantly supplied by the water that flows to them from the stem;\r\nif then in consequence of a touch the sap-passages of the leaves are\r\npressed together, the supply of water is not sufficient to prevent\r\ntheir becoming relaxed. Ray mixes up together the movements from\r\nirritability and the daily periodical movements, as was done till\r\nrecent times; the latter, he says, occur not only in the leaves of\r\nLeguminosae, but in almost all similar pinnate leaves, and with these\r\nperiodical movements of leaves he places also the periodical opening\r\nand closing of the flowers of Calendula, Cichorium, Convolvulus, and\r\nothers. That these last movements are due to changes of temperature\r\nappeared to him to be proved by an experiment of Jacob Cornutus on\r\nflowers of Anemone, which, when cut off and placed in a well-closed\r\nbox in a warm place, opened at an unusual time if the flower stalk\r\nonly was dipped in warm water. This fact, afterwards forgotten and\r\ndiscovered again a few years ago, of the dependence of the movements of\r\nflowers on changes of temperature, was applied by Ray to explain the\r\nperiodical movements of leaves, which, to use his own expression, fold\r\nthemselves together as the cold of night draws on, and open again with\r\nthe day, and as he thought that these movements are of the same kind\r\nas the movements of irritability in Mimoseae, he tries to explain how\r\ncooling has the same effect as a touch. It was natural in the existing\r\nstate of science to assume that changes of temperature were the first\r\ncauses of various movements, for a thrust was at that time almost the\r\nonly recognised cause of motion. Hence Ray explained the movements\r\nof growing stems which are now called heliotropic by a difference of\r\ntemperature on the opposite sides. A certain Dr. Sharroc had observed\r\nthe stem of a plant on which he was experimenting grow towards that\r\npart of a window, where the air found free entrance through an\r\nopening; from this circumstance, and from the rapid elongation of the\r\nstems of plants growing under cover, which he ascribed to the higher\r\ntemperature, Ray concluded that cold air hinders the growth of the side\r\nof a stem on which it falls, and that this side must become concave.\r\nThus Ray used the etiolation of plants grown under cover to explain\r\ntheir heliotropic curvatures, as De Candolle did one hundred and\r\nforty years later, only with this difference, that he described the\r\nrapidity with which forced plants shoot up to the higher temperature,\r\nDe Candolle to want of light. On the other hand Ray knew perfectly well\r\nthat the green colour of leaves is not produced by the access of air\r\nbut by the light, for, as he says, plants become green under glass, and\r\nnot under an opaque cover; and if they become less green under glass\r\nthan in the open air, this is because the glass absorbs certain rays of\r\nlight and reflects others. Ray however, like almost all later observers\r\ntill quite recent times, did not keep the elongation and bleaching of\r\netiolated plants sufficiently distinct; his account of this phenomenon\r\nis spoilt by the presence of much that is obscure.\r\n\r\nIt has been justly observed by other writers on botanical subjects\r\nthat no notice is usually taken of one of the most remarkable of the\r\nphenomena of which we are here speaking, because, being a matter of\r\nevery-day occurrence, it is simply accepted as something obviously in\r\naccordance with the nature of things; this is the fact, that the main\r\nstems of plants grow vertically upwards and their main roots downwards.\r\nTo the French academician Dodart, whom we have already encountered\r\nin the history of the theory of nutrition, is due the great merit of\r\nbeing the first to find this apparently simple phenomenon really very\r\nremarkable; he convinced himself by experiments on germinating plants,\r\nthat these vertical positions are caused by curvatures, and endeavoured\r\nto discover the physical reason why the main roots if placed in an\r\nabnormal position escape from it by curving in the downward direction,\r\nand the main stems in the upward direction, till they both reach the\r\nvertical line. It was a matter of minor importance that his mechanical\r\nexplanation, which supposed that the fibres of the roots contract on\r\nthe moister side and those of the stem on the same side lengthen, was\r\nquite unsatisfactory; it was much more important that these remarkable\r\nphenomena were made the subject of scientific enquiry, and we find that\r\nvarious observers soon after directed their attention to them, and\r\nexercised their acuteness in attempts at explaining them; to these\r\nattempts we shall return in a future page.\r\n\r\nA still more universal phenomenon than the vertical growth of stems\r\nand roots is the growth of plants generally, and it required as\r\nmuch or even more of the spirit of enquiry to propose the question,\r\nwhether this growth can be explained by mechanical laws, and what that\r\nexplanation is. Mariotte touched on this question in 1679, but only\r\nincidentally, and supposed that the stretching of the pith, which meant\r\nat that time the whole of the parenchymatous tissue, was the cause of\r\nthe growth of the parts of plants. This idea might have had its origin\r\nin the Aristotelian notion that the pith is the seat of the vegetable\r\nsoul, but Mariotte endeavoured to give physical reasons for it. Hales\r\nin his ‘Statical Essays’ of 1727 went much more minutely into the\r\nquestion of the growth of plants. Following the train of thought in his\r\ndoctrine of the nutrition of plants, he introduces his observations on\r\ntheir growth with the remark, that plants consist of sulphur, volatile\r\nsalts, earth, water, and air, the first four of which attract one\r\nanother, and therefore form the solid, inert part of the substance of\r\nplants; the air behaves in a similar manner as long as it is kept by\r\nthe other substances in a solid condition; but as soon as it is set at\r\nliberty it is capable of expansion. On this power of expansion in the\r\nair, by which the juices of plants are quickened and strengthened, he\r\nbuilds his mechanical theory of growth, according to which the plastic\r\nparts of the plant assume a state of tension, and as the air enters\r\ninto combination with other substances and so becomes fixed, warmth and\r\nmovement are excited, and these make the particles of sap assume by\r\ndegrees a form and shape. These principles supplied his starting-point.\r\nTo get a clearer idea of the way in which the growth of the parts\r\nof plants proceeds, he made equi-distant punctures in young stalks\r\nand leaves, and found that the intervals between them increased by\r\ngrowth more in the younger intervening parts than in the older. In the\r\ncourse of these observations he is particularly struck by the great\r\nlongitudinal extension which accompanies growth, because, as he says,\r\nthe vessels still continue hollow, as a glass tube when drawn out to\r\nits utmost extent retains its canal. He finds Borelli’s idea confirmed,\r\nthat the young shoot grows by the extension in length of the moisture\r\nin the spongy pith; and he endeavours to explain the fact that the\r\ngrowing shoot does not extend equally in the transverse direction, and\r\nso become spherically rounded off like an apple, from the nature of the\r\nstructure of the cell-tissue. That the air enclosed in the tissue and\r\nthe sap with it presses into the shoot with sufficient force to produce\r\nso great an extension, he thinks is proved by his experiments, which\r\nshow him the great force with which the water rises in the bleeding\r\nvine, and forces itself into swelling peas; it is known, he says, that\r\nwater acts with great force when it is heated in a vessel, for water\r\ncan be driven into the air by heat; the sap in plants is composed of\r\nwater, air, and other active ingredients, and makes its way with great\r\nforce into the tubes and cells, when it is heated by the sun.\r\n\r\n2. The course of the 18th century gradually increased the number\r\nof the phytodynamical phenomena, to which physiologists paid more\r\nor less attention, and repeated attempts were made to explain them\r\non mechanical principles. These attempts were for the most part\r\nunsatisfactory, because movements distinct in kind from one another\r\nwere mixed up together, their dependence on external influences was not\r\ndistinctly perceived, and the knowledge of the anatomical structure of\r\nthe parts which exhibited the movements was, owing to the decline of\r\nphytotomy, extremely imperfect. Moisture and warmth played the chief\r\npart in these explanations, but their mode of operation was expressed\r\nin the most general terms; the mechanical processes in plants were\r\ndescribed much in the way in which a person with very indefinite ideas\r\nas to the nature of steam and the construction of the inside of a\r\nsteam-engine might speak of its movements. The majority of writers,\r\nin accordance with the tendencies of the age, professed their desire\r\nto refer the phenomena of life in plants not to an unknown principle\r\ncalled the soul, but to mechanical and physical causes; but they did\r\nnot apply their minds to the examination of these phenomena with that\r\nstrenuous effort, which in this subject especially could alone lead to\r\na complete and satisfactory explanation of them.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus studied the periodical movements of flowers in 1751 and those\r\nof leaves in 1755, but a mechanical explanation of them was not to be\r\nexpected from him; he contented himself with pointing out the external\r\nconditions of these phenomena in many species, with classifying them,\r\nand giving the periodical movements a new name by calling the positions\r\nassumed by night the sleep of plants; nor did he use the word at all in\r\na metaphorical sense, for he saw in this sleep of plants a phenomenon\r\nentirely analogous to sleep in animals. That the sleep-movements were\r\nnot capricious but due to external influences was with him a necessary\r\nconsequence from the nature and idea of the plant, which was that of\r\na living and growing being, only without sensation. But it should be\r\nmentioned that he stated correctly that the movements connected with\r\nthe sleep of plants are not caused by changes of temperature, or not\r\nby these only, but by change of light, since they take place in the\r\nuniform temperature of a conservatory.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus’ account of these kinds of movement was only formal, it is\r\ntrue, but still it was well-arranged and clear; the treatment of the\r\nsame and other movements by his contemporary Bonnet was quite the\r\nreverse. It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more shapeless,\r\nsuch an utter confusion of things entirely different from one another,\r\nas is to be found in Bonnet’s experiments and reflections on the\r\nvarious movements of leaves and stems in his work on the function\r\nof leaves, published in 1754; geotropic and heliotropic curvatures,\r\nnutations and periodic movements, are all run one into another; a\r\nperson who understands something of the subject may find here and\r\nthere single things in his experiments that may be turned to account,\r\nbut he was himself unable to make any use of them. He set out with a\r\npreconception which prevented him from the first from understanding\r\nwhat his experiments showed him; it was his object to prove from a\r\nmultitude of instances, that stalks and leaves so curve, twist and turn\r\nin all cases, that the under sides of the leaves are directed towards\r\nthe ground, in order that they may be able to suck up the dew, which\r\naccording to his theory is the chief nutriment of plants and rises from\r\nthe ground. It is no great merit in him, that amid all this confusion\r\na correct observation here and there forced itself upon him, as for\r\ninstance that organs, chiefly such as are young and ductile, if they\r\nare put out of their natural position, endeavour to recover it by\r\nbending and twisting. On the other hand his conclusions with regard to\r\nthe mechanical causes of these movements are utterly inane; the least\r\nskill in judging of the results of his experiments must have led him to\r\nvery different ideas; warmth and moisture, he says, appear to be the\r\nnatural causes of movement, but warmth is more effective than moisture,\r\nand the warmth of the sun more effective than that of the air. This\r\nexplanation is unsuitable to just those cases which he chiefly studied,\r\nthe geotropic and heliotropic curvatures. In one point only he arrived\r\nultimately at a right judgment, namely that the great lengthening of\r\nthe stem, the small size attained by the leaves and the want of colour\r\nin plants grown under cover, are caused by partial or entire absence of\r\nlight; Ray however had shown this before as regards the colour.\r\n\r\nThough Du Hamel, like many later writers, treated Bonnet’s\r\ninvestigations, uncritical as they were and without plan, with great\r\nrespect, he gave himself a much better account of the various movements\r\nof plants. In the sixth chapter of the fourth book of his ‘Physique\r\ndes arbres,’ 1758, he discussed all the phenomena of the kind that\r\nwere known to him under the title: ‘On the direction of stem and\r\nroots, and on the nutation of the parts of plants.’ Under the head\r\nof upright or oblique direction of the stem and roots, he speaks of\r\ngeotropic, heliotropic, and some other curvatures; then follows a\r\nchapter on etiolation, and under the title, ‘Movements of plants, which\r\napproximate to some extent to the voluntary movements of animals,’ he\r\nenquires into the periodical and sensitive movements of the leaves of\r\nMimosa; he winds up with a short account of Linnaeus’ flower-clock, and\r\nof the hygroscopic movements of the valves of fruits. The movements\r\nof tendrils and climbing stems, of which Du Hamel seems to have known\r\nlittle, are not mentioned in this connection; but they are noticed in\r\na former chapter with hairs, thorns and similar things,—a plan which\r\nCesalpino also adopted. If this way of dealing with the different\r\nmovements of plants is to be taken as a classification of them, it\r\nwas a very unsatisfactory one; for it separates like things, and\r\nbrings together things unlike; still it is an improvement on Bonnet’s\r\narrangement, while the author gives us also some new and valuable\r\nobservations. He may claim to be the first who made heliotropic\r\ncurvature depend on light, and it is a significant fact that he got\r\nthis conclusion from Bonnet’s experiments. After examining, like Hales,\r\ninto the distribution of growth in shoots, and discovering that this\r\nceases with the commencement of lignification, he proposed to himself\r\nthe question: at what spots does the lengthening of the roots take\r\nplace, and he found from suitable experiments that every root-fibre\r\ngrows only at its terminal portion, which is a few lines in length,\r\nand that no other part of it increases in length. In the chapter on\r\nthe direction of the parts of plants he examines the explanations\r\nwhich had been given of heliotropic curvatures. Astruc and de la Hire\r\nhad supposed the weight of the descending sap to be the cause of the\r\ndownward curvature of the roots, and the lighter vapours which ascend\r\nin the tissue to be the cause of the upward curvature of the stem;\r\nBazin on the contrary attributed the geotropism of the roots to the\r\nmoisture in the earth. Du Hamel undertook to determine whether the\r\nmoisture, the low temperature, or the absence of light in the earth\r\nmade the roots curve downwards, and he was obliged by the result of\r\nhis experiments to deny that they do. But he was unfortunate in his\r\nown explanation of the movements which we should now call geotropic,\r\nheliotropic and periodic, for he came to the conclusion that the\r\n‘direction of the vapours’ inside the vessels of the plant and round\r\nabout the plant has more to do with producing these movements than\r\nany other causes, and that if warmth and light appear to influence\r\nthem, it is perhaps only because they produce vapours or communicate a\r\ndefinite movement to them. As regards the movements of the leaves of\r\nMimosa, Du Hamel repeated the experiment made by Mairan in 1729, in\r\nwhich the periodic movement continued even in constant darkness; he\r\nfound that this was so, and concluded that the periodic movements of\r\nMimosa do not essentially depend on temperature and changes of light;\r\nHill had determined in 1757 that the alternation of day and night was\r\nthe cause of the movements connected with the sleep of plants, because\r\nhe found that darkness artificially produced in the day-time made the\r\nplants assume the nocturnal position; but Zinn in 1759 came to the same\r\nconclusion as Mairan and Du Hamel. It was not till long after that the\r\nquestion was to some extent cleared up by Dutrochet. Du Hamel thought\r\nit necessary to give a formal refutation of the opinion expressed by\r\nTournefort, that the movements of plants are produced by muscles, and\r\nto show that Tournefort’s vegetable muscles are hygroscopic fibres.\r\n\r\nWe have to mention in conclusion, that Du Hamel was the first who\r\nobserved that the two branches of a vine-tendril twine in opposite\r\ndirections round a support that happens to be between them; he also\r\nappears to have been the first who compared the irritability of the\r\nstamens of Opuntia and Berberis with that of Mimosa-leaves; the\r\nstamens of Berberis were afterwards examined by Covolo in 1764, by\r\nKoelreuter 1788, by Smith in 1790, and by others, but without leading\r\nto any discoveries respecting the nature of the irritability. Dal\r\nCovolo’s famous essay on the stamens of the Cynareae (1764) produced\r\nno absolutely final result, but it contained some particulars which\r\nthrew light on the mechanical laws of these movements of irritability.\r\nKoelreuter, who studied these objects in 1766, thought less of\r\ndiscovering a mechanical explanation of them, than of finding arguments\r\nin the irritability of the stamens for the necessity of insects to\r\npollination. An entirely new kind of movement was discovered by Corti\r\nin 1772 in the cells of Chara, which is now known as the circulation\r\nof the protoplasm; this form of movement in plants appeared at first\r\nto bear no resemblance whatever to the phytodynamic processes then\r\nknown, and it was not brought into connection with them till a long\r\ntime after; on the contrary an erroneous idea soon began to prevail,\r\nthat it was a real rotation of the sap, as understood by the early\r\nphysiologists; this idea held its ground till far into the 19th\r\ncentury, and being combined with mistaken notions respecting the\r\nmovements of latex, was developed by Schultz-Schultzenstein into the\r\ndoctrine of the circulation of the vital sap. For a time indeed Corti’s\r\ndiscovery was forgotten, and had to be reproduced by Treviranus in\r\n1811. A somewhat similar fortune attended the discovery of the movement\r\nof the Oscillatorieae by Adanson in 1767, which misled Vaucher into\r\npronouncing them to be animals.\r\n\r\n3. Imperfect as were the theoretical efforts of the 18th century in\r\nthis branch of botanical study, yet they aimed at tracing the various\r\nmovements back to the play of physical forces. But in the closing\r\nyears of the century another order of ideas, injurious to the healthy\r\nprogress of science, made its appearance in this, as in other parts of\r\nbotany and zoology. Even the majority of those who had no sympathy with\r\nthe nature-philosophy and its phraseology, believed that there was in\r\norganised bodies something of a special and peculiar nature; because\r\nthe attempts made to explain the phenomena of life by mechanical laws\r\nwere on the whole unsatisfactory, all such explanations were looked\r\nupon as impossible and even absurd, while it was forgotten that the\r\nvital force, which was to explain everything, was a mere word for\r\neverything that could not be explained in the life of organisms. This\r\nvital force was personified, and seemed to assume a really tangible\r\nform in the movements of plants. But the moment that a phenomenon was\r\nhanded over to this force, all further investigation was abandoned;\r\nthe idea with regard to phytodynamical phenomena especially was that\r\nof the peasant, who could only explain the movement of the locomotive\r\nby supposing that there was a horse shut up in it. Moreover the\r\nknowledge of the inner structure of plants was at its lowest point\r\nat the end of the 18th century; the spiral threads which could be\r\nunwound were the only structural element whose form was to some extent\r\nunderstood, and their hygroscopic movements were supposed to be due\r\nto a combination of the pulsations of the vital force with the spiral\r\ntendency of the plant. At the same time whole bundles of vessels were\r\ntaken for spiral fibres, or were supposed to consist of them, and\r\nthese were thought to be vegetable muscles, which contract under the\r\ninfluence of various kinds of irritation, and so cause the movements\r\nin the organs of plants; but it was forgotten that in the organs which\r\nexhibit the most striking movements, such as sensitive leaves and\r\nleaves that suffer periodical changes of position, these ‘muscles’\r\noccupy a central position which unfits them for the function ascribed\r\nto them. It would be unprofitable and wearisome to give many examples\r\nof what is here stated, though many might easily be collected; it will\r\nsuffice to quote some sentences only from Link’s ‘Grundlehren der\r\nAnatomie und Physiologie’ of 1807; they are particularly instructive,\r\nbecause Link declared against the nature-philosophy and professed to\r\nbe on the side of inductive science. Under the head of movements of\r\nplants, he discussed geotropic curvatures and other movements in the\r\nsuperficial manner of the time and only to come to the conclusion, that\r\nthe direction of growth of stems and roots is caused by a polarity of\r\na definite kind in every plant, from which we may argue, he says, ‘to\r\nhigher connections of our planet in the world of space.’ He says again,\r\n‘that it is natural to conjecture that light is the cause of the sleep\r\nof plants,’ and then gives the contradictory statements of Hill, Zinn,\r\nand De Candolle, all jumbled together into an inextricable tangle in a\r\nfashion which sets all maxims of reasonable discussion at defiance. He\r\nthen puts aside all attempts at mechanical explanation with the remark,\r\nthat plants observe their regular times of sleep even when kept in the\r\ndark and at a low temperature, for this evident habituation is one of\r\nthe most important marks of vitality. He is led to similar results by\r\nDesfontaine’s observation, that a Mimosa, exposed to the shaking of\r\na wheeled vehicle, closes at first but then opens again. Speaking of\r\nthe rapid oscillations of the leaves of Hedysarum gyrans and similar\r\nmovements, he rejects Percival’s idea of a will in plants, but says\r\nthat the attempts to derive them from mechanical or chemical causes has\r\nonly led to solemn trifling.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that men who could print such remarks as these and still\r\nworse than these, could not possibly effect anything in the province\r\nof botany which we are considering. The broad and shallow stream of\r\nsuch opinions as these flowed on till later even than 1830, but it\r\nran dry at last when its supplies were cut off by the effect of new\r\ndiscoveries, and scientific investigation again gained the upper hand.\r\nSome calmer thinkers, who could not rest content with empty words, had\r\nmeanwhile been pursuing the path trodden by Ray, Dodart, Hales, and\r\nDu Hamel, and by experiment and earnest reflection had brought new\r\nfacts to light, which were at least calculated to pave the way for the\r\nmechanical explanation of phytodynamical phenomena. Senebier in his\r\n‘Physiologic végétale’ (1700) had described some minute researches\r\nwhich he had made into the subject of etiolation; and though he made\r\nthe great mistake of attributing the want of colour in the leaves\r\nand the excessive elongation of the stems to the decomposition of\r\ncarbon dioxide which does not take place in the dark, yet he gave an\r\nexample of genuine scientific investigation and again expressed its\r\ntrue spirit, when he said that the Linnaean phrase, ‘the sleep of\r\nplants,’ was unsuitable, because the sleeping leaves are not relaxed,\r\nbut continue as stiff as in the day-time. De Candolle also, like\r\nSenebier, experimented in 1806 on the influence of light on vegetation,\r\nand succeeded in proving that the daily period of leaves may be\r\nreversed by artificial illumination; he was, as we have said above,\r\nan adherent of the theory of a vital force, but only made use of it\r\nwhen physical explanations failed him. The same year, (1806) is the\r\ndate of a brilliant discovery, which was extremely inconvenient to the\r\nthorough-going adherents of the nature-philosophy and the vital force,\r\nand did much to bring the scientific study of the movements of plants\r\nback to the right path. ANDREW KNIGHT[137] showed by experiment that\r\nthe vertical growth of stems and primary roots is due to gravitation;\r\nhe attached germinating plants to a rapidly revolving wheel, and thus\r\nexposed them to the centrifugal force, either alone or combined with\r\ngravitation; the radicles, which normally follow gravitation, here\r\ntook the direction of the centrifugal force, while the stems assumed\r\nthe opposite direction. The next question was, why gravitation makes\r\nthe roots and stems take exactly opposite directions, why, that is,\r\nin a plant placed in a horizontal direction, the root-end curves\r\ndownwards and the stem upwards. Knight supposed that the root, being\r\nof a semi-fluid consistence, is bent downwards by its own weight,\r\nwhile the nutrient sap in the stem moves to the underside and causes\r\nstronger growth there, until by means of the curvature so produced the\r\nstem assumes the upright position. Here too, as in Dodart’s case, it\r\nwas no great misfortune that the explanation proved afterwards to be\r\ninsufficient; it served at the time to explain as much as was then\r\nknown of the matter. The spirit of true scientific research displayed\r\nin Knight’s explanation of geotropism was expressed in many other\r\ncontributions which he made to vegetable physiology; two only must be\r\nmentioned here. He showed in 1811 that under suitable conditions roots\r\nare diverted from the vertical direction by moist earth, an observation\r\nwhich was confirmed by Johnson in 1828 and afterwards forgotten. More\r\nattention was excited by his discovery in 1812, that the tendrils\r\nof Vitis and Ampelopsis are negatively heliotropical, that is, that\r\nthey turn away from the source of light. A few other cases of this\r\nkind of heliotropism have since been discovered, and they are highly\r\ninteresting, because they teach that there is the same opposition in\r\nthe relations of plants to light as in their relations to gravitation.\r\nKnight possessed some of the direct and bold reasoning power of his\r\ncountryman Hales; he defied the vital force, and was always ready with\r\na mechanical explanation, if it was at all possible to find one. Thus\r\nhe explained the twining of tendrils by supposing that the pressure of\r\nthe support drives the juices to the opposite side, which consequently\r\ngrows more vigorously and causes the curvature, which makes the tendril\r\nwind round the support. This theory was at all events better than the\r\none which von Mohl sought to put in its place in 1827, and no better\r\none was suggested till very recently. Much the same may be said of\r\nKnight’s explanation of geotropic curvatures; it is true that Johnson\r\nshowed in 1828 that the ends of roots as they curve downwards set in\r\nmotion a heavier weight than themselves, and therefore do not simply\r\nsink down, and Pinot in 1829, that they force their way even into\r\nquicksilver, and that consequently Knight’s theory, at least as regards\r\nthe roots, is unsatisfactory; but no better theory has yet been found,\r\nand his view also of the progress in the upward curvature of the stem\r\nhas not given place to any one that can be said to be more generally\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nIt was the commonly received opinion till after 1820 that the\r\nmovements of the parts of plants are produced by the spiral vessels,\r\nor, which meant the same thing in those days, by the vascular bundles.\r\nIt was an important event therefore when Dutrochet proved in 1822,\r\nthat the movements of the leaves of Mimosa were due to the alternate\r\nexpansion of the antagonistic masses of parenchyma in the pulvinus or\r\ncushion of succulent tissue found at the articulation, and that the\r\ncentral vascular bundle follows passively their curvatures. Lindsay had\r\nindeed arrived at the same conclusion from similar experiments as early\r\nas 1790, but his unprinted essay on the subject was first produced by\r\nBurnett and Mayo in 1827. Meanwhile Dutrochet had also found that light\r\ninfluences the movements of the leaves in different ways; alternation\r\nof light and darkness excites them to motion, while leaves which have\r\nbecome rigid in continued darkness are restored by light to their\r\nnormal condition of sensitiveness.\r\n\r\nMuch attention was bestowed in the period between 1820 and 1830 on\r\nvarious questions connected with the movements of the organs of plants.\r\nIn 1826 the faculty of medicine in Tübingen offered a prize for an\r\nessay on the peculiar nature of tendrils and climbing plants, which\r\nwas intended to bring into discussion all the points which required\r\nto be cleared up before a more thorough understanding of the whole\r\nsubject could be obtained. The two essays which gained the prize were\r\npublished in 1827. One was by Palm, the other by von Mohl, both of very\r\ndifferent value. Palm’s essay is a good and careful college-exercise;\r\nbut there is nothing of this character in von Mohl’s. The skill\r\nof the composition, the exact knowledge of the literature of the\r\nsubject, the wealth of personal experience, the searching criticism,\r\nthe prominence given to all that is fundamental and important, the\r\nfeeling of certainty and superiority which the book inspires, all\r\nunite to make the reader forget that it is not the work of a mature\r\nand professed naturalist, but of a student of two-and-twenty years\r\nof age. This academical prize-essay on the structure and twining of\r\ntendrils and climbing-plants was one of von Mohl’s best works, and\r\naltogether the best that appeared on the subject before Darwin wrote\r\nupon it in 1865; at the same time it must be said that von Mohl did\r\nnot explain the exact mechanical processes in the tissues, for he\r\nassumed a sensitiveness in both cases which causes the winding round\r\nthe support, and thought that this sensitiveness must be conceived of\r\n‘dynamically’ and not ‘mechanically.’ Nevertheless von Mohl conducted\r\nhis investigation up to this point according to strict rules of\r\ninductive science, and studied the facts which were capable of being\r\nestablished by observation and experiment with an exactness such as\r\nhad not yet been applied to any case of movement in plants. It was\r\na genuine production of its author, strictly inductive up to the\r\npoint at which deduction became necessary. Von Mohl pointed out in it\r\nessential differences in the behaviour of tendrils and climbing plants,\r\nand the corresponding distinction between the organs which have to\r\nbe considered in each case, and he made the important discovery that\r\ncontact with the support acts as a stimulus on the tendril, though\r\nhe was wrong in supposing that the climbing stem also is similarly\r\naffected. He at once assented to Dutrochet’s new view, that it is not\r\nthe vascular bundles but the layers of parenchyma which produce the\r\nmovements. He distinctly rejected the notion constantly repeated,\r\nthough with some hesitation, since the time of Cesalpino, that tendrils\r\nand climbing-plants ‘seem to seek for’ their supports, as also the idea\r\nwhich many had adopted without reflection from Grew, that the varying\r\ndirection of a climbing-stem is due to the varying influence of the\r\ncourse of the sun and moon, and showed that the movements of nutation\r\nin the stem are sufficient to explain the apparent seeking for the\r\nsupport; it is true that he did not fully explain the corresponding\r\nphenomena in tendrils, but he saw enough to set aside the old ideas.\r\nWe must not here go further into his many, and for the most part\r\nexcellent, observations; some of course had afterwards to be corrected,\r\nbut the important point was, that his full investigation of the\r\nsubject showed how such phenomena must be studied, if we are to arrive\r\nat a strictly mechanical explanation of them.\r\n\r\nIf von Mohl had attempted to give a mechanical explanation of the\r\nprocesses in the tissue of twining organs he must necessarily\r\nhave failed from ignorance of the agency of diffusion, which must\r\ncertainly be taken into consideration. This agency was not discovered\r\nby Dutrochet till the year (1826) in which von Mohl undertook his\r\ninvestigation, and some time elapsed before it was sufficiently\r\nunderstood to be successfully applied to the explanation of phenomena\r\nin vegetation. Dutrochet did indeed attempt so to apply his theory in\r\n1828, and showed that changes in the turgidity of tissue are produced\r\nby endosmose and exosmose, and consequently that a new mechanical\r\nmethod of explanation had been discovered for processes which had been\r\nusually referred to a supposed vital principle; but in his later and\r\nmore detailed researches into geotropism, heliotropism, periodical\r\nmovements and movements of irritability, which he collected together\r\nin his ‘Mémoires’ of 1837, he fell into two different mistakes: he\r\nassumed conditions of size and stratification in cells which do not\r\nactually exist, for the purpose of explaining very various kinds of\r\ncurvature by endosmose, and he was not satisfied with endosmose in\r\nthe parenchyma; he postulated changes in the vascular bundles also,\r\nwhich were supposed to be produced by the influence of the oxygen\r\nin a way which he did not explain. Thus there were blots in his\r\nexplanation of separate processes, and his mechanical theories remained\r\nunsatisfactory; but it is worthy of recognition and was most important\r\nfor the development of phytodynamics, that he was thoroughly in earnest\r\nin his purpose of explaining every movement in plants by mechanical\r\nlaws. Even the opponents of such explanations were obliged to go deeply\r\ninto mechanical relations in order to refute him, and no one could any\r\nlonger be imposed upon by the simple assertion that all depends on the\r\nvital force; so devoted a partisan of vital force as Treviranus had to\r\ndeal with endosmose as an established principle. Moreover Dutrochet’s\r\ncopious investigations presented such an abundance of interesting\r\nobservations, delicate combinations, and suggestive considerations,\r\nthat the study of them is still instructive and indeed indispensable to\r\nany one who is occupied with such researches. Comparison of his papers\r\nin the ‘Mémoires’ of 1837 with what was before known on the mechanical\r\nlaws of the movements of plants leaves us in no doubt that energetic\r\nmental effort had taken the place of the old complacent absence of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nStill no single movement had as yet been fully explained on mechanical\r\nprinciples; but by the year 1840 clearer views had been attained\r\non the whole subject; the co-operation of external agencies was in\r\nsubstance recognised, and the different forms of movement were better\r\ndistinguished, though much still remained to be done in this direction;\r\nand as regards the mechanical changes in the tissue of the parts\r\ncapable of movement, a factor had been given in endosmose which must be\r\ntaken into account, though it might be necessary to seek a different\r\nmode of applying it.\r\n\r\n4. Before proceeding to give some account of the theoretical efforts\r\nthat were made in this subject between 1840 and 1860, it should be\r\nmentioned that new cases of movement in plants had been discovered.\r\nDutrochet observed that the stem in the embryo of Viscum is negatively\r\nheliotropic, and had carefully studied its behaviour; he opposed the\r\nold notion that the geotropic downward curvature is peculiar to main\r\nroots, and that that is the reason why they are in ‘polar’ opposition\r\nto the stem, by pointing to the shoots of the rhizomes of Sagittaria,\r\nSparganium, Typha, and other plants, which at least when young curve\r\ndownwards with some force; and on extending Knight’s experiment with\r\na rotating wheel he found that the leaves also exhibit a peculiar\r\ngeotropism. These observations and some new examples of periodical\r\nmovement and movements of irritability were connected without\r\ndifficulty with the forms of movement that had been long known in the\r\nvegetable kingdom, and contributed to correct the views that had been\r\nentertained respecting them. But this was not the case for a time with\r\ntwo phenomena which also fall within the province of phytodynamics,\r\nnamely normal growth and the movements of the protoplasm, which exhibit\r\nthe two opposite extremes, so to speak, of the facts connected with\r\nmovement. Various measurements had been made of the growth of plants\r\nsince the beginning of the century, and attempts had been made to\r\nestablish its dependence on light and heat, but without any great\r\nsuccess. Treviranus had rediscovered the movements of the protoplasm\r\nin 1811 in Nitella. Similar movements were repeatedly pointed out by\r\nAmici, Meyen, and Schleiden in the cells of higher plants, but they\r\nwere taken for streamings of the cell-sap; it was still unknown that\r\nall these were movements of the same organised substance, which moves\r\nindependently in water in the form of swarmspores. These phenomena,\r\nespecially the movements of swarmspores, were noticed and studied\r\nseparately between 1830 and 1840, but no one thought of bringing\r\nboth these movements and the mechanical laws of normal growth into\r\nconnection with the phenomena which had usually been treated together\r\nunder the head of movements in the vegetable kingdom. De Candolle and\r\nMeyen did not mention them in this connection in their ‘Compendia’ of\r\n1835 and 1839; Meyen on the contrary discussed the ‘circulation of the\r\ncell-juice’ with nutrition, and the movement of swarmspores with the\r\npropagation of Algae. The two writers just named, like Du Hamel before\r\nthem, divided into two main groups the movements in the vegetable\r\nkingdom which had been long known and were usually put together, and\r\ntreated of geotropic and heliotropic curvatures and the movements of\r\ntendrils and climbing plants under the head of direction of plants,\r\nand the periodical movements and movements connected with irritability\r\nunder that of movements, though they gave no reasons for this\r\nclassification; it rested evidently on an indistinct feeling outrunning\r\nclear perception—that in the one they were dealing with growing parts\r\nof plants, in the other with parts which had ceased to grow. Dutrochet\r\nmade no such distinction, but he was the only one among the chief\r\nrepresentatives of vegetable physiology between 1830 and 1840 who had\r\nthoroughly adopted the mechanical view of phytodynamical phenomena.\r\nWe have said that Treviranus was a warm adherent of the theory of\r\nvital force. De Candolle and Meyen, it is true, endeavoured to explain\r\neach separate movement if possible by mechanical laws, but in their\r\nmore general speculations they readily lapsed into antiquated views;\r\nthus De Candolle speaks of the sensitiveness of Mimosa as a case of\r\nextreme ‘excitability,’ and Roeper, in accordance with his other views,\r\ntranslated De Candolle’s expression, autonomous movements, by the term\r\n‘voluntary’ movements. The movements he is speaking of are those of\r\nHedysarum gyrans, and Meyen also terms them ‘voluntary’ movements,\r\nand ranks them with those of Oscillatoria. That he was influenced\r\nin this by a dim reminiscence of the old vegetable soul is shown by\r\nthe heading, ‘Of movements and sensation in plants,’ placed over the\r\nsection of his work in which the expression occurs; and in the last\r\nchapter of this section, he attributes some kind of sensation to plants\r\non account of the evident marks of design in their movements, though he\r\nveils his meaning in obscure and tortuous phrases.\r\n\r\n5. The mists of the nature-philosophy and the vital force disappeared\r\nfrom the phytodynamical province of botanical science after the year\r\n1840. The methodical research of inductive science, which had still\r\nto contend with them up to that time, was once more acknowledged as\r\nthe supreme guide and ruler. A few stray dissentients were still\r\nto be found, but the general voice was against them. There was an\r\neager desire for exact investigation of the facts, in order to lay\r\na firmer foundation for future theory. But no conclusive results,\r\nno such entirely new points of view were gained before 1860, as\r\nwere established during the same time in phytotomy, morphology, and\r\nsystematic botany. To these subjects the most eminent enquirers applied\r\ntheir best powers almost exclusively, while phytodynamics vanished from\r\nthe field of view of the generality of botanists, and no one made them\r\nthe object of the comprehensive, intense, and effectual study, which\r\nDutrochet had previously devoted to them. At the same time his example\r\nwas not without a powerful effect. The working of endosmose was further\r\ninvestigated and treated as a part of molecular physics. Greater\r\nfreedom was thus gained in the mechanical treatment of phytodynamical\r\nquestions, and a firmer basis secured by aid of the advances which were\r\nbeing at the same time made in phytotomy. But with the exception of\r\nBrucke’s essay on Mimosa (1848), the works produced during this period\r\nwere chiefly devoted to the critical examination of the writings of\r\nprevious observers, and whatever appeared that was new and positive\r\nremained incomplete till after the date at which this history ends.\r\nUnder these circumstances we must be content to indicate briefly the\r\nmore important of the new discoveries and of the efforts made at this\r\ntime to advance the theory of the subject.\r\n\r\nSeveral observers occupied themselves soon after 1840 with the\r\ninfluence of light on the growing parts of plants. Payer maintained in\r\n1843 that the radicles of various Phanerogams turn from the light, and\r\na controversy arose between him and Dutrochet on the point, in which\r\nDurand took part in 1845, but no definite conclusion was arrived at\r\neven as regards the certainty of the fact. The beautiful discovery of\r\nSchmitz in 1843, that the Rhizomorphs grow more slowly in the light\r\nthan in the dark, and arc at the same time negatively heliotropic,\r\nmight have proved much more important; but the theoretical value of\r\nthis fact has till quite recently been entirely misconstrued. Sebastian\r\nPoggioli had discovered in 1817 that highly refringent rays of light\r\nwere more heliotropically active, and the fact was confirmed by Payer\r\nin 1842; but Dutrochet in 1843 maintained, and incorrectly, that it is\r\nthe brightness of the light, and not its refrangibility, which is the\r\ndetermining factor. Zantedeschi found in 1843 that red, orange, and\r\nyellow light are heliotropically inactive. Gardner on the contrary in\r\n1844, and Guillemain in 1857, came with the help of the spectrum to\r\nthe conclusion that all its rays are heliotropically active, and the\r\nquestion long remained hampered by these contradictory statements, till\r\nit was taken up again in 1864. This was a similar case to that of the\r\nquestion of the effect of variegated light on the elimination of oxygen\r\nand the formation of chlorophyll. Daubeny had given attention to the\r\nsubject in 1836 and inclined to the view, that it was the brightness\r\nof the light rather than its refrangibility which was the important\r\npoint; and Draper’s observation, made with the spectrum in 1844, that\r\nthe elimination of oxygen reaches its maximum in yellow light and\r\ndecreases on each side of it, was generally understood as though it\r\nwas a question only of the brightness of the light. It is only within\r\nrecent times that this view has been abandoned, and in the same way all\r\nthe investigations which have just been mentioned were not settled till\r\nafter 1860, and were scarcely turned to any theoretical account.\r\n\r\nThe bright point in the history of phytodynamics at this time is\r\nBrücke’s treatise in 1848 on the movements of the leaves in Mimosa,\r\nnot only on account of the very important results which it records,\r\nbut still more for the exactness of its method which has made it a\r\nmodel of research in these subjects. He first established the essential\r\ndifference between the periodical nocturnal position of the leaves of\r\nMimosa and the position which they assume when irritated, and showed\r\nthat the former is connected with an increase in turgidity, the latter\r\nwith relaxation; he showed further that if the upper half of the\r\norgan is removed, the periodical movements and the irritability both\r\ncontinue. Of great importance to the theory was the clear account\r\ngiven of the tension which is produced between the vascular bundle and\r\nthe turgescent layer of parenchyma, and the reference of the periodic\r\nmovements and of those of irritation to the movements of water in the\r\nantagonistic masses of parenchyma. The details were still imperfect,\r\nbut one great advantage was secured, namely, the doing away with the\r\nmysticism associated with the idea of irritability, from which even von\r\nMohl was not entirely free.\r\n\r\nA full enquiry into the downward curvature of roots, published by\r\nWigand in 1854, deserves mention, because it threw some light on the\r\ntheory of the strictly mechanical questions connected with a subject\r\nwhich had been for some time neglected, and because, while containing\r\nother instructive matter, it refuted the theory, founded on endosmose\r\nand on the structure of tissue, which had been suggested by Dutrochet\r\nand adopted by von Mohl, since it showed that one-celled organs also\r\nexhibit geotropic curvatures. The great theoretical importance of the\r\nfact that all the various phytodynamical phenomena, with the exception\r\nof movements of irritability, are manifested in one-celled organs, was\r\nnot fully understood till after 1860.\r\n\r\nIt has been already observed, that no theoretical result was obtained\r\nfrom the discovery of circulation in cells made by Corti in 1772, and\r\nrepeated by Treviranus in 1811. The same may also be really said of the\r\nlater observations of Amici, Meyen, and Schleiden, which went to show\r\nthat such movements occur very generally in vegetable cells. In like\r\nmanner the movements of swarmspores, of which a considerable number\r\nof instances had been observed before 1840, were rather the subject\r\nof astonishment than of scientific consideration. They could not in\r\nfact find their place in the general system until Nägeli and von Mohl\r\ndiscovered in 1846, that it is in the protoplasm that the so-called\r\nmovement of the cell-sap takes place, and Alexander Braun made it known\r\nin 1848 that the swarmspores are naked masses of protoplasm, and indeed\r\ntrue vegetable cells. A new substratum for the movements in plants,\r\nand one of the simplest kind, was thus obtained; and Nägeli attempted\r\nin 1849 a mechanical explanation of the movements of swarmspores, while\r\nin 1859 De Bary exhibited in the Myxomycetes most instructive examples\r\nof such movements. If Nägeli failed in his attempt, yet it seemed\r\npossible that the protoplasm had an important share in the production\r\nof all phytodynamic phenomena, and the idea appeared capable of a very\r\nwide application when Unger pointed out in 1855 the resemblance between\r\nvegetable and animal protoplasm. It is true that not one of these\r\nlater observations led to any conclusive results till after 1860; but\r\nthat the whole subject of phytodynamics had made considerable advance\r\nas early as 1850 is apparent from the account given of it by von Mohl\r\nin his ‘Vegetabilische Zelle’ of 1851, and by Unger in his ‘Lehrbuch\r\nder Anatomie und Physiologie der Pflanzen’ of 1855. Von Mohl chiefly\r\nexposes the unsatisfactory nature of the attempts that had been made to\r\nexplain the phenomena; Unger, on the other hand, shows how much that is\r\nfundamentally important had been already established.\r\n\r\nThe mechanics of growth had not been included by former writers among\r\nthe phenomena of phytodynamics, nor was it so included by either Unger\r\nor von Mohl. It seemed to be supposed that there was a fundamental\r\ndifference between growth and other movements in the vegetable\r\nkingdom, and this idea was entertained even in the most recent times.\r\nFrom the time of Mariotte and Hales no one had made the mechanical\r\nlaws of growth the subject of special investigation or theoretical\r\nconsideration; yet some observations had been made on the formal\r\nrelations of growth and its dependence on external influences. Ohlert\r\n(1837) was the first after Du Hamel who studied the distribution of\r\ngrowth in the root; Cotta in 1806, Chr. F. Meyer in 1808, Cassini in\r\n1821, Steinheil and others made measurements in connection with the\r\nsame question in the stem, but only with the result of showing that the\r\ndistribution of growth at the internodes may vary very greatly, and\r\neven Münter’s measurements in growing internodes in 1841 and 1843, and\r\nGrisebach’s in 1843 led to no appreciable result, because the observers\r\nneglected to apply the figures obtained to the theory of the subject.\r\nIt seemed to be generally supposed that it was enough simply to write\r\ndown the measurements in figures, and that a theoretical result would\r\nspring into being of itself; on the contrary the real scientific work\r\nbegins after the figures are obtained. The same cause prevented the\r\nobservations which have yet to be mentioned from producing real fruit.\r\nThe influence of the variability of the temperature of the air[138],\r\nand of the alternation of daylight and darkness on the longitudinal\r\ngrowth of internodes and leaves after they have emerged from the\r\nbud-condition, had often been investigated; Christian Jacob Trew\r\npublished in 1727 long-continued daily measurements on the flowering\r\nstem of Agave Americana in conjunction with observations on temperature\r\nand weather; a hundred years later similar observations were made by\r\nErnst Meyer in 1827, by Mulder in 1829, and by Van der Hopp and De\r\nVriese in 1847 and 1848; but Harting in 1842 and Caspary in 1856 were\r\nthe first who went at all deeply into the questions involved. These\r\nobservations, some of which were carefully made, led to no further\r\nresult than the discovery of the fact, which Münter indicated and\r\nHarting applied to theoretical purposes but which no one else thought\r\nworthy of attention, namely that the rate of growth increases at first\r\nand independently of external causes, till it reaches a maximum, and\r\nthen decreases till at length it comes to an end; they did not even\r\nestablish a really practical method of observation. Scarcely two\r\nobservers arrived at the same result, because the questions respecting\r\nthe relations of growth in length to temperature and light had not\r\nbeen clearly and distinctly put. Communications were published in the\r\nperiodicals, which simply tabled long-continued measurements of the\r\nlongitudinal growth of parts of plants, and gave an idea of constant\r\nirregularity of growth, without suggesting any explanation of the\r\ncauses which produced it; so indistinct were the ideas of observers\r\non these subjects even after 1850, that the majority of them proposed\r\nto themselves the question, what difference there is between growth\r\nby day and by night; it did not occur to them that day and night\r\nare not simple forces of nature, but different and very variable\r\ncomplications of external conditions of growth, such as temperature,\r\nlight and moisture, and that such a mode of putting the question could\r\nnot possibly lead to the discovery of the relations established by\r\nlaw, so long as the several factors were unknown which are included in\r\nthe conceptions of day and night. Harting’s essay of 1842 is superior\r\nto those above mentioned, inasmuch as he distinctly endeavoured to\r\nobtain from his measurements some definite propositions that might\r\nbe applied to the theory of the subject, and especially to give a\r\nmathematical expression to the dependence of growth on temperature,\r\nbut his success in this particular point was not great. The idea, that\r\nthere must be a simple arithmetical relation to be discovered between\r\ngrowth and temperature, had been suggested by Adanson in the previous\r\ncentury, and it found many supporters in the period between 1840 and\r\n1860: but it should be observed that the term growth was used in a\r\nloose and popular sense to sum up all the phenomena of vegetation\r\nin one expression. Adanson had supposed that the time occupied in\r\nthe unfolding of the bud was determined by the sum of the degrees\r\nof the mean daily temperature, reckoned from the beginning of the\r\nyear; Senebier, and at a later time De Candolle, declared against the\r\nexistence of any such relation, but a similar idea was not only very\r\ngenerally entertained after 1840, but it even came to be treated as a\r\nprobable natural law. Boussingault had pointed out that in the case\r\nof cultivated plants in Europe and America, if the whole period of\r\nvegetation expressed in days is multiplied by the mean temperature of\r\nthe same period, the products do not deviate widely from one another\r\nin the same species. It was thereupon assumed that these deviations\r\nare due to incorrect observation, and that such a constant product of\r\nthe period of vegetation and the mean temperature will be found in\r\nevery species. This product then received the unmeaning appellation\r\nof the sum of the temperature. If such a relation between vegetation\r\nand temperature really exists, it would necessarily follow that other\r\nthings, such as light, moisture, the soil, &c., have no influence at\r\nall on the period of vegetation, not to speak of those internal causes\r\nwhich help to complicate the simplest processes of growth. It is\r\nunnecessary to expose in this place the absurdities involved in this\r\nidea of the sum of the temperature; the needful remarks will be found\r\nin the ‘Jahrbücher für wissenschaftliche Botanik’ of 1860, i. p. 370.\r\nIt is a remarkable fact however that such monstrous reasoning should\r\nhave been able to prejudice science in various ways even later than the\r\nyear 1860. A new science was actually invented and called Phaenology,\r\nwhich accumulated thousands and thousands of figures, in order to\r\ndiscover the sum of the temperature for every plant, and as this\r\ncrude empiricism showed that the simple multiplication of the period\r\nof vegetation by the temperature gave no constant result, the square\r\nof the temperature was tried and other tricks of arithmetic adopted.\r\nThough Alphonse de Candolle as early as 1850 expressed well-founded\r\nobjections to the whole of this method of treating the subject, in\r\nwhich the mean temperature played much too important a part, yet he\r\nwas so far unable to keep clear of the prevailing ideas, that he\r\nthought he could express the effect of light by an equivalent number\r\nof degrees of temperature, and so save the supposed law of temperature\r\nin vegetation. To this idea may be traced his work on the geography of\r\nplants, published in two volumes in 1855, which however contains a rich\r\ntreasure of personal experience and knowledge of the works of other\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nIt appears then that scarcely any point of fundamental importance in\r\nphytodynamics was cleared up before the period at which this history\r\ncloses; it was not till after that date that these questions began to\r\nbe studied from new points of view, and they are at the present time\r\nstill under discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Adanson, 66, 116, 545, 561.\r\n\r\n  Aepinus, 257.\r\n\r\n  Agardh, 143, 160, 205, 352.\r\n\r\n  Albertus Magnus, 14.\r\n\r\n  Aldrovandi, 18.\r\n\r\n  Alpino, 380.\r\n\r\n  Alston, 402.\r\n\r\n  Amici, 223, 284, 371, 432, 434, 558.\r\n\r\n  Ammann, 39.\r\n\r\n  Aristotle, 4, 6, 13, 16, 43, 51, 219, 376, 450.\r\n\r\n  Astruc, 543.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bachmann, 7, 39, 63, 74-76, 83, 101.\r\n\r\n  Baisse (de la Baisse), 483.\r\n\r\n  Banks, 139.\r\n\r\n  Bartling, 144, 145.\r\n\r\n  Batsch, 125, 137, 143.\r\n\r\n  Bauhin, Kaspar, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 17, 19, 24-26, 33, 39, 64, 80, 100,\r\n    115.\r\n\r\n  Bazin, 543.\r\n\r\n  Beale, 472.\r\n\r\n  Berkeley, 205.\r\n\r\n  Bernhardi, 109, 225, 256, 263-266, 347.\r\n\r\n  Bischoff, 161, 198, 207, 438, 439.\r\n\r\n  Blair, Patrick, 391.\r\n\r\n  Bock, Hieronymus, 3, 13, 14, 19, 24, 27, 28.\r\n\r\n  Boehmer, 248, 483.\r\n\r\n  Boerhaave, 78.\r\n\r\n  Bonnet, 163, 247, 486-488, 541.\r\n\r\n  Borelli, 536.\r\n\r\n  Bornet, 210, 443.\r\n\r\n  Boussingault, 373, 449, 531, 561.\r\n\r\n  Bradley, 391, 406.\r\n\r\n  Braun, A., 162, 165, 169, 170-181, 184, 208, 312, 314, 334, 336, 442,\r\n    558.\r\n\r\n  Bravais, 169.\r\n\r\n  Brisseau-Mirbel, 198, 224, 226, 250, 256, 259, 261, 262, 272-275, 284,\r\n    307, 311, 321.\r\n\r\n  Brongniart, Adolph, 147, 321, 432, 436.\r\n\r\n  Brown, Robert, 110, 112, 122, 139-144, 155, 151, 227, 323, 433.\r\n\r\n  Brücke, 339, 536, 557.\r\n\r\n  Brunfels, 3, 5, 13, 14.\r\n\r\n  Brunn, 255.\r\n\r\n  Buffon, 89.\r\n\r\n  Burckhard, 83, 391, 397.\r\n\r\n  Burnett, 550.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Calandrini, 486.\r\n\r\n  Camerarius, Rud.

Here, as throughout,\r\nthe present work will be confined to the investigation and description\r\nof the development of strictly botanical ideas.\r\n\r\n[3] Otto Brunfels, born at Mainz before the year 1500, was at first a\r\nstudent of theology and a monk; becoming a convert to Protestantism he\r\nwas actively engaged at Strassburg first as a teacher and afterwards as\r\na physician; he died in 1534.\r\n\r\n[4] Beside the herbals mentioned in the text, which may be regarded\r\nas scientific works on botany, a considerable number of books on the\r\nsignature of plants were written in the 16th and 17th centuries in the\r\ninterests of medicine or medical superstition. It was believed that\r\ncertain external marks and resemblances between parts of plants and the\r\norgans of the human body indicated the plants and the parts of them\r\nwhich possessed healing virtues. Pritzel mentions by name twenty-four\r\nworks of the kind, which appeared between 1550 and 1697. The herbals\r\nalso noticed the signatures, and even Ray has an enquiry into the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[5] The fragments of Aristotelian botany which have come down to us\r\nare to be found translated from Wimmer’s edition in Ernst Meyer’s\r\n‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ i. p. 94.\r\n\r\n[6] Ernst Meyer (Geschichte der Botanik) gives a full account of\r\nTheophrastus, who was born at Lesbos A.C. 371 and died A.C. 286. An\r\nedition of his work ‘De historia et de causis plantarum’ was published\r\nby Theodor Gaza in 1483. See also Pritzel’s ‘Thesaurus literarum\r\nbotanicarum.’\r\n\r\n[7] See L. C. Treviranus in his work, ‘Die Anwendung des Holzschnitts\r\nzur bildlichen Darstellung der Pflanzen,’ Leipzig, 1855, and Choulant\r\n‘Graphische Incunabeln,’ Leipzig, 1858.\r\n\r\n[8] Konrad Gesner, born in Zürich in 1516, became after many\r\nvicissitudes of fortune Professor of Natural History in his native\r\ntown, and died there of the plague in 1565. See Ernst Meyer,\r\n‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ iv.\r\n\r\n[9] Leonhard Fuchs, born at Membdingen in Bavaria in 1501, was\r\na student of the classics under Reuchlin in Ingolstadt in 1519,\r\nand became Doctor of Medicine in 1524. Owing to his conversion to\r\nProtestantism he led an unsettled life for some years, but was finally\r\nmade Professor of Medicine in Tübingen in 1535, and died there in 1566.\r\nSee Meyer, ‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ iv.\r\n\r\n[10] Rembert Dodoens (Dodonaeus), born at Malines in 1517, was a\r\nphysician, and a man of varied culture; he published a number of\r\nbotanical works, some of them in Flemish, after 1552, and finally in\r\n1583 his ‘Stirpium Historiae Pemptades vi’ (Antwerp). From 1574 to\r\n1579 he was physician to the Emperor Maximilian II. In 1582 he became\r\nProfessor in Leyden and died in 1585. See Ernst Meyer, ‘Geschichte der\r\nBotanik,’ iv. p. 340.\r\n\r\n[11] Hieronymus Bock (Tragus) was born at Heiderbach in the Zweibrücken\r\nin 1498; he was destined to the cloister, but embraced Protestantism\r\nand became a schoolmaster in Zweibrücken and superintendent of the\r\nPrince’s garden; he was afterwards preacher in Hornbach, where he\r\npractised also as a physician and pursued his botanical studies; he\r\ndied in 1554. See Ernst Meyer, ‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ iv. p. 303.\r\n\r\n[12] Pierandrea Mattioli, who was born at Siena in 1501 and died there\r\nin 1577, was for many years physician at the court of Ferdinand I. He\r\nwrote rather in the interests of medicine than of botany; his herbal,\r\noriginally a commentary on Dioscorides, was gradually enlarged and went\r\nthrough more than sixty editions and issues in different languages. See\r\nMeyer, ‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ vi.\r\n\r\n[13] Charles de l’Écluse (Carolus Clusius) was born in Arras in 1526.\r\nHis family suffered from religious persecution in France, and he spent\r\nthe greater part of his life in Germany and the Netherlands; in 1573 he\r\nremoved to Vienna by the invitation of Maximilian II; in 1593 he became\r\nprofessor in Leyden and died there in 1609. See Meyer, ‘Geschichte der\r\nBotanik,’ iv, who gives full information respecting the eventful life\r\nof this distinguished man.\r\n\r\n[14] Jacques Dalechamps, a native of Caen, who died in 1588, was a\r\nphilologist rather than an original investigator of nature, as is\r\nremarked by Meyer in his ‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ vi. p. 395.\r\n\r\n[15] Mathias de l’Obel (Lobelius), the friend and fellow-countryman of\r\nDodoens and de l’Écluse, was born at Lille in 1538 and died in England\r\nin 1616. A full account of this botanist will be found in Meyer.\r\n\r\n[16] Kaspar Bauhin was born at Basle in 1550, and like his elder\r\nbrother John studied under Fuchs; he collected plants in Switzerland,\r\nItaly, and France, and became professor in Basle; he died in 1624. Some\r\naccount is given of him and of his brother by Haller in the preface\r\nto his ‘Historia Stirpium Helvetiae’ (1768), and by Sprengel in his\r\n‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ i. p. 364 (1818).\r\n\r\n[17] Andrea Cesalpino (Caesalpinus) of Arezzo was born in 1519. He was\r\na pupil of Ghini and professor at Pisa, and afterwards physician to\r\nPope Clement VIII. He died in 1603.\r\n\r\n[18] We find it stated in Theophrastus that if the pith of the vine\r\nis destroyed the grapes contain no stones; this evidently points to a\r\nstill higher antiquity for the view that the seeds are formed from the\r\npith; see the De causis plantarum, v. ch. 5, in the ‘Theophrasti quae\r\nsupersunt opera’ of Schneider, Leipzig, 1818.\r\n\r\n[19] These words are quoted by Linnaeus in the ‘Philosophia Botanica,’\r\npar. 159.\r\n\r\n[20] See his biography by Guhrauer, ‘Joachim Jungius und sein\r\nZeitalter,’ Tübingen, 1850; on his place in philosophy consult Ueberweg\r\n(‘Geschichte der Philosophie,’ iii. p. 119), who regards him as a\r\nforerunner of Leibnitz.\r\n\r\n[21] Morison served in the royal army against Cromwell, and after the\r\ndefeat of his party retired to Paris, where he studied botany under\r\nRobin. He was made physician to Charles II and Professor of Botany in\r\n1660, and Professor of the same faculty in Oxford ten years later. See\r\nSprengel, ‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ ii. p. 30.\r\n\r\n[22] The wood-engraving of the 16th century had fallen into decay,\r\nand engraving on copper-plate had taken its place. A thick volume of\r\nfigures of plants in the largest folio size engraved on copper, the\r\n‘Hortus Eistädtensis,’ appeared in the beginning of the 17th century.\r\n\r\n[23] John Ray, born at Black Notley in Essex, was also a zoologist\r\nof eminence. He studied theology and travelled in England and on the\r\ncontinent, and afterwards devoted himself entirely to science, being\r\nsupported by a pension from Willoughby. See Carus, ‘Geschichte der\r\nZoologie,’ p. 428.\r\n\r\n[24] A. Q. Bachmann (Rivinus) was the third son of Andreas Bachmann,\r\na physician and philologist of Halle. He is said to have spent 80,000\r\nflorins on the publication of his works and the providing them with the\r\n500 copper-plates with which they were illustrated. A life of him and\r\njust estimate of his work, by Du Petit-Thouars, is to be found in the\r\n‘Biographie universelle ancienne et moderne.’\r\n\r\n[25] Tournefort was born at Aix in Provence, and received his early\r\neducation in a Jesuit college. He was intended for the Church, but\r\nafter his father’s death, in 1677, he was able to devote himself\r\nentirely to botany. After travelling in France and Spain, he became\r\nProfessor at the Jardin des Plantes in 1683; but while thus engaged he\r\nmade various journeys in Europe, and in 1700 visited Greece, Asia, and\r\nAfrica—everywhere diligently collecting the plants which he afterwards\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n[26] In addition to the Autobiography of Linnaeus, various accounts of\r\nhis life have been written, some of which are mentioned in Pritzel’s\r\n‘Thesaurus Lit. Bot.’ A strange revelation of his character and\r\nsentiments is to be found in his treatise on the ‘Nemesis divina,’\r\nwhich he bequeathed to his son. Of this work Professor Fries has\r\nunfortunately published an epitome only, which is noticed in the\r\nRegensburg Flora, No. 44 (1851). On Linnaeus’ services to zoology, see\r\nCarus, ‘Geschichte der Zoologie,’ München, 1872.\r\n\r\n[27] Printed in Jessen’s ‘Botanik der Gegenwart and Vorzeit,’ p. 287.\r\n\r\n[28] ‘Epistola ad Godofredum Gulielmum Leibnitzium etc. cum Laurentii\r\nHeisteri praefatione,’ Helmstadii, 1750.\r\n\r\n[29] See the excellent account of the Platonic and Aristotelian\r\nphilosophies and of scholasticism in Albert Lange’s ‘Geschichte des\r\nMaterialismus,’ second edition, 1874.\r\n\r\n[30] The comparison of the vegetable seed with the egg in animals,\r\nwhich is in itself incorrect, comes, as Aristotle tells us, from\r\nEmpedocles, and was a favourite one with the systematists.\r\n\r\n[31] Linnaeus uses the word ‘herba’ for the older word ‘germen,’ which\r\nwith him means the ovary.\r\n\r\n[32] It would not be difficult to prove that the doctrine of the\r\nconstancy of species is properly a conclusion from scholasticism, and\r\nultimately from the Platonic doctrine of ideas, and was therefore\r\nassumed as self-evident before the time of Linnaeus, who only gave it a\r\nmore distinct and conscious expression; his arguments from experience\r\nare without force. The strength of the dogma lies in its relation to\r\nthe platonico-scholastic philosophy, which the systematists followed,\r\nmore or less consciously, up to quite recent times.\r\n\r\n[33] The authority for the contents of these dissertations is Wigand’s\r\n‘Kritik und Geschichte der Metamorphose’ (1846).\r\n\r\n[34] Bernard de Jussieu, born at Lyons in 1699, and at first a\r\npractising physician there, was by Vaillant’s intervention called to\r\nParis, and after Vaillant’s death became Professor and Demonstrator at\r\nthe Royal Garden. He and Peissonel were among the first who declared\r\nagainst the vegetable nature of the Corals. It is expressly stated in\r\nhis Éloge (‘Histoire de l’Académie Royale des Sciences,’ Paris, 1777)\r\nthat he founded his natural families on the Linnaean fragment. He died\r\nin 1777.\r\n\r\n[35] A. L. de Jussieu, born at Lyons, came to Paris to his uncle\r\nBernard in 1765. In 1790 he was a member of the Municipality, and till\r\n1792 Superintendent of Hospitals. When the Annales du Museum were\r\nfounded in 1802, he resumed his botanical pursuits. In 1826 his son\r\nAdrien took his place at the Museum. See his life by Brougniart in the\r\n‘Annales des Sciences Naturelles,’ vii (1837).\r\n\r\n[36] Joseph Gärtner was born at Calw in Würtemberg in 1732, and died\r\nin 1791. He commenced his studies in Göttingen in 1751, where he was a\r\npupil of Haller. He travelled into Italy, France, Holland, and England\r\nin order to make the acquaintance of famous naturalists, and worked\r\nalso at physics and zoology. In 1760 he was Professor of Anatomy in\r\nTübingen, and in 1768 became Professor of Botany at St. Petersburg;\r\nbut finding himself unable to bear the climate, he returned to Calw\r\nin 1770, and gave himself up entirely to his book, ‘De fructibus\r\net seminibus plantarum,’ which he had already commenced. Banks and\r\nThunberg, one of whom had returned from a voyage round the world, the\r\nother from Japan, handed over to him the collections of fruits which\r\nthey had made. His persistent study, partly with the microscope,\r\nbrought him near to blindness. There is an interesting life of Gärtner\r\nby Chaumeton in the ‘Biographie Universelle.’\r\n\r\n[37] Augustin Pyrame de Candolle sprang from a Provençal family, which\r\nhad fled from religious persecution to Geneva, where it was and is\r\nstill held in great estimation. He associated as a boy with Vaucher,\r\nand on his first visit to Paris in 1796 with Desfontaines and Dolomieu,\r\nand after his return to Geneva was a friend of Senebier. The elder\r\nSaussure, and afterwards Biot, whom he assisted in an investigation in\r\nphysics, endeavoured to attach him to that study. He spent the years\r\nfrom 1798 to 1808 in Paris, where he lived in close intercourse with\r\nthe naturalists of that city. Numerous smaller monographs, and the\r\npublication of his work on succulent plants and of a new edition of\r\nDe Lamarck’s ‘Flore Française,’ occupied this earlier period of his\r\nlife. From 1808 to 1816 he was Professor of Botany at Montpellier.\r\nDuring this time he made many botanical journeys in all parts of\r\nFrance and the neighbouring countries, and wrote many monographs, his\r\nessays on the geography of plants, and his most important work, the\r\n‘Théorie élémentaire.’ From 1816 till his death in 1841 he resided\r\nonce more in Geneva, which had freed itself in 1813 from the enforced\r\nconnection with France established in 1798. Here De Candolle found\r\ntime to take part in political and social questions, in addition to an\r\nalmost incredible amount of botanical labour. (Notice sur la vie et les\r\nouvrages de A. P. De Candolle par De la Rive, Genève, 1845.)\r\n\r\n[38] Robert Brown was the son of a Protestant minister of Montrose, and\r\nstudied medicine first at Aberdeen and afterwards in Edinburgh; he then\r\nbecame a surgeon in the army, and was at first stationed in the north\r\nof Ireland. When the Admiralty despatched a scientific expedition to\r\nAustralia under Captain Flinders in 1801, he was appointed naturalist\r\nto the expedition on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks, F. Bauer\r\nbeing associated with him as botanical draughtsman, Good as gardener,\r\nWestall as landscape-painter; one of the midshipmen of the vessel\r\nwas John Franklin. In consequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship\r\nFlinders left Australia, intending to return with a better one, but was\r\nshipwrecked on the voyage and detained by the French at Port Louis as a\r\nprisoner of war till 1810. The naturalists of the expedition remained\r\nin Australia till 1805, when Brown returned to England with 4000 for\r\nthe most part new species of plants. Sir J. Banks appointed him his\r\nlibrarian and keeper of his collections in 1810; he was also Librarian\r\nto the Linnaean Society of London. In 1823 he received the bequest of\r\nBanks’ library and collections, which were to be transferred after his\r\ndeath to the British Museum; but by his own wish they were deposited\r\nthere at once, and he himself received the appointment of Custodian of\r\nthe Museum and remained in that position till his death. At Humboldt’s\r\nsuggestion Sir Robert Peel’s Ministry granted him a yearly pension of\r\n£200. His merits were universally acknowledged, and Humboldt even named\r\nhim ‘botanicorum facile princeps.’\r\n\r\n[39] Stephen Ladislaus Endlicher was born at Pressburg in 1805, and\r\nabandoning the study of theology became Scriptor in the Imperial\r\nLibrary at Vienna in 1828, and in 1836 Custos of the botanical\r\ndepartment of the Imperial Collection of Natural History. Having\r\ngraduated at the University in 1840, he became Professor of Botany and\r\nDirector of the Botanic Garden. His library and herbarium, valued at\r\n24,000 thalers, he presented to the State, and with his private means\r\nfounded the Annalen des Wiener-Museums, purchased botanical collections\r\nand expensive botanical books, and published his own works and works of\r\nother writers. His official salary was small, and having exhausted his\r\nresources in these various expenses, he put an end to his own life in\r\nMarch 1849. Endlicher was not only one of the most eminent systematists\r\nof his day, but a philologist also, and a good linguist. He wrote among\r\nother things a Chinese grammar. See ‘Linnaea,’ vol. xxxiii (1864 and\r\n1865), p. 583.\r\n\r\n[40] John Lindley, Professor of Botany in the University of London, was\r\nborn at Chatton near Norwich in 1799, and died in London in 1865.\r\n\r\n[41] Auguste de Saint Hilaire was born at Orleans in 1779, and died\r\nthere in 1853; he was Professor at Paris, and in 1840 published\r\nhis ‘Leçons de Botanique comprenant principalement la Morphologie\r\nVégétale,’ etc. This work contains a somewhat diffuse account of P.\r\nde Candolle’s doctrine of symmetry, together with Goethe’s theory of\r\nmetamorphosis and Schimper’s doctrine of phyllotaxis, and his own\r\nviews also on classification founded on the comparative morphology of\r\nthe day. It is marked by fewer errors than will be found in Lindley’s\r\ntheoretical writings, but it is less profound, and touches only\r\nincidentally on fundamental questions; at the same time it possesses\r\nhistorical interest as giving a lucid description of the state of\r\nmorphology before 1840.\r\n\r\n[42] See Wigand, ‘Geschichte und Kritik der Metamorphose,’ Leipzig,\r\n1846, p. 38.\r\n\r\n[43] See Goethe’s collected works in forty volumes, Cotta, 1858, vol.\r\nxxxvi.\r\n\r\n[44] See Haeckel, ‘Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte,’ ed. 4, 1873, p. 80.\r\n\r\n[45] Louis Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars was born in Anjou in 1758 and\r\ncollected plants during many years in the Mauritius, Madagascar, and\r\nBourbon. He was afterwards Director of the Botanic Garden at Roule, and\r\nbecame Member of the Academy in 1820. He died in 1831. His articles\r\nin the ‘Biographie Universelle’ prove him to have been a writer of\r\nability. Preconceived opinions interfered with the success of his own\r\ninvestigations, especially into the increase in thickness of woody\r\nstems, and obstinate adherence to such notions prevented an unbiassed\r\ninterpretation of what he saw. See Flora, 1845, p. 439.\r\n\r\n[46] K. F. Schimper, born in Mannheim in 1803, was at first a student\r\nof theology in Heidelberg, but having afterwards travelled as a paid\r\ncollector of plants in the south of France, he applied himself to the\r\nstudy of medicine. From 1828 to 1842 he was employed as a teacher in\r\nthe University of Munich, though occasionally engaged in exploring the\r\nAlps, Pyrenees, and other districts, in the service of the King of\r\nBavaria. It was during this period of his life that he composed his\r\nmost important works on phyllotaxis, and essays on the former extension\r\nof glaciers, and on the glacial period. He returned to the Palatinate\r\nin 1842, and died at Schwetzingen in 1867 in the enjoyment of a pension\r\nfrom the Grand duke of Baden.\r\n\r\n[47] See Hofmeister, ‘Allgemeine Morphologie’ (1868), pp. 471, 479, and\r\nSachs, ‘Lehrbuch der Botanik,’ ed. 4 (1874), p. 195.\r\n\r\n[48] See Nägeli, ‘Beiträge zur Wissenschaftlichen Botanik’ (1858), I,\r\npp. 40, 49.\r\n\r\n[49] A comparison of the two theories and a refutation of Schleiden’s\r\nassertion, that that of the brothers Bravais expresses better ‘the\r\nsimplicity of the law,’ will be found in ‘Flora,’ 1847, No. 13, from\r\nthe pen of Sendtner, and in Braun’s ‘Verjüngung,’ p. 126.\r\n\r\n[50] This is not at all true of modern inductive science, which merely\r\nforms a different idea of the connection, and has regard to the\r\nrelation between the percipient subject and the phenomena.\r\n\r\n[51] See A. Bayer, ‘Leben und Wirken F. Unger’s,’ Gratz (1872), p. 52.\r\n\r\n[52] See Darwin’s repudiation of this statement on p. 421 of Ed. 6 of\r\nthe ‘Origin of Species.’\r\n\r\n[53] Casimir Christoph Schmidel was born in 1718 and died in 1792; he\r\nwas Professor of Medicine in Erlangen, and was the first who described\r\nthe sexual organs in various Liverworts.\r\n\r\n[54] Lantzius Beninga, born in East Friesland in 1815, was a professor\r\nin Göttingen, and died in 1871.\r\n\r\n[55] Gottlieb Wilhelm Bischoff was born at Dürkheim on the Hardt in\r\n1797, and died as Professor of Botany at Heidelberg in 1854. He wrote\r\nvarious manuals and text-books which are careful and industrious\r\ncompilations, but being entirely conceived in the spirit of the times\r\npreceding Schleiden they are now obsolete; his investigations however\r\ninto the Hepaticae, Characeae, and Vascular Cryptogams, illustrated\r\nby very beautiful drawings from his own hand, are still of value; and\r\nthe same may be said of his ‘Handbuch der botanischen Terminologie und\r\nSystemkunde’ on account of its numerous figures.\r\n\r\n[56] Karl Adolf Agardh (1785-1859) was until 1835 Professor in Lund,\r\nafterwards Bishop of Wermland and Dalsland. Jacob Georg Agardh, born\r\nin 1813, was Professor in Lund. William Henry Harvey (1811-1866) was\r\nProfessor of Botany in Dublin. Friedrich Traugott Kützing, born in\r\n1807, was Professor in the Polytechnic School of Nordhausen.\r\n\r\n[57] C. G. Nees von Esenbeck published his ‘System der Pilze und\r\nSchwämme’ in 1816; Th. F. L. Nees von Esenbeck, in conjunction with A.\r\nHenty, a ‘System der Pilze’ in 1837. The first (1776-1858) was for a\r\nlong time President of the Leopoldina, Professor of Botany in Breslau,\r\nand one of the chief representatives of the nature-philosophy. Elias\r\nFries, born in 1794, became Professor of Botany in Upsala in 1835; he\r\ndied in 1878. Léveillé (1796-1870) was a physician in Paris. August\r\nJoseph Corda was born at Reichenberg in Bohemia in 1809, and became\r\ncustodian of the National Museum in Prague in 1835; he undertook a\r\njourney to Texas in 1848, from which he never returned, having probably\r\nperished by shipwreck in 1849. Weitenweber, in the ‘Abhandlungen der\r\nBöhmischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaft,’ Bd. 7, Prag, 1852, gives\r\na full account of this eminent mycologist. Corda was the first who\r\nthoroughly applied the microscope to copying and describing every form\r\nof Fungus that was known to him, and especially the minuter ones.\r\nHis ‘Icones Fungorum hucusque cognitorum’ (1837-1854) are still an\r\nindispensable manual in the study of the subject.\r\n\r\n[58] Jean Pierre Étienne Vaucher, the instructor and friend of P. de\r\nCandolle, was a minister and professor in Geneva.\r\n\r\n[59] Trentepohl’s communication is to be found in the ‘Botanische\r\nBermerkungen und Berichtigungen’ of A. W. Roth, Leipsic, 1807.\r\n\r\n[60] Pier’ Antonio Micheli, born at Florence in 1679, was Director\r\nof the Botanic Garden there, and died in 1737. Johann Jacob Dillen\r\n(Dillenius), born in Darmstadt in 1687, was Professor of Botany\r\nin Oxford, and died in 1747. These two botanists were the first\r\nwho submitted the Mosses and the lower Cryptogams to scientific\r\nexamination, and endeavoured to prove the presence of sexual organs in\r\nthese plants.\r\n\r\n[61] Jacob Christian Schaeffer, born in 1718, was Superintendent in\r\nRegensburg; he died in 1790.\r\n\r\n[62] See Sachs, ‘Lehrbuch der Botanik,’ ed. 4 (1874), p. 245.\r\n\r\n[63] Fr. Wilh. Wallroth, born in the Harz in 1792, was district\r\nphysician at Nordhausen. He died in 1857. See ‘Flora’ for 1857, p. 336.\r\n\r\n[64] Robert Hooke, born in 1635 at Freshwater in the Isle of Wight,\r\nwas a man of marvellous industry and varied acquirement in spite of\r\na delicate constitution. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in\r\n1662, and was afterwards its Secretary and Professor of Geometry in\r\nGresham College. He died in 1703. There is a good account of him by de\r\nl’Aulnaye in the ‘Biographie Universelle.’\r\n\r\n[65] Marcello Malpighi, born at Crevalcuore near Bologna in 1628,\r\nbecame Doctor of Medicine in 1653, and after 1656 was Professor in\r\nBologna, Pisa, Messina, and a second time in Bologna; in 1691 he was\r\nnamed Physician to Innocent XII. He died in 1694. On his services\r\nto comparative anatomy, and the anatomy of the human body, see the\r\n‘Biographie Universelle’ and Carus, ‘Geschichte der Zoologie,’ p. 395.\r\n\r\n[66] We read at p. 3: ‘Componuntur expositae fistulae (spirales)\r\nzona tenui et pellucida, velut argentei coloris, lamina parum lata,\r\nquae spiraliter locata et extremis lateribus unita tubum interius et\r\nexterius aliquantulum asperum efficit; quin et avulsa zona capites seu\r\nextremo trachearum tum plantarum tum insectorum non in tot disparatos\r\nannulos resolvitur, ut in perfectorum trachea accidit; sed unica zona\r\nin longum soluta et extensa extrahitur.’\r\n\r\n[67] Nehemiah Grew, the son of a clergyman in Coventry, appears to\r\nhave been born in 1628. Having taken a Doctor’s degree in a foreign\r\nUniversity, he practised as a physician in his native town, and pursued\r\nat the same time his phytotomical researches. He became Secretary to\r\nthe Royal Society in 1677, and published his ‘Cosmographia Sacra’ in\r\n1701. He died in 1711. See the ‘Biographie Universelle.’\r\n\r\n[68] Leeuwenhoek’s observations in animal anatomy were perhaps more\r\nimportant than those which he made in botany. Carus (‘Geschichte der\r\nZoologie,’ p. 399) says of him: ‘While Malpighi used the microscope\r\nwith system and in accordance with the requirements of a series of\r\ninvestigations, the instrument in the hands of the other famous\r\nmicroscopist of the 17th century was more or less a means of gratifying\r\nthe curiosity excited in susceptible minds by the wonders of a world\r\nwhich had hitherto been invisible. Still the discoveries, which were\r\nthe fruit of an assiduous use of the microscope continued during fifty\r\nyears, embraced many subjects and were important and influential. Anton\r\nvon Leeuwenhoek was born in Delft in 1632. Being intended for trade,\r\nhe had not the advantage of a learned education and is said even to\r\nhave been ignorant of Latin; his favourite occupation was the preparing\r\nsuperior lenses, with which he incessantly examined new objects without\r\nbeing guided at any time by a scientific plan. The Royal Society of\r\nLondon, to whom he communicated his observations, made him a member of\r\ntheir body. He died in his native town in 1723, being ninety years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\n[69] This subject will be noticed again in the history of the sexual\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n[70] C. F. Wolff was born at Berlin in 1733. He studied anatomy under\r\nMeckel and botany under Gleditsch, in the Collegium Medico-chirurgicum\r\nin that city. He afterwards resorted to the University of Halle, and\r\nthere made acquaintance with the philosophy of Leibnitz and Wolff,\r\nwhich predominates too much in his dissertation, ‘Theoria Generationis’\r\n(1759). Haller, the representative of the theory of evolution against\r\nwhich this work was directed, replied to it in a kindly spirit and\r\nentered into a correspondence with its youthful author. After lecturing\r\non medicine in Breslau, he was admitted to teach physiology and other\r\nsubjects in the Collegium Medico-chirurgicum in Berlin, but was twice\r\npassed over in the appointment to professorships in that institution.\r\nHe received an appointment in the Academy of St. Petersburg from the\r\nEmpress Catherine II in 1766, and died in that city in 1794. See Alf.\r\nKirchhoff, ‘Idee der Pflanzenmetamorphose,’ Berlin, 1867.\r\n\r\n[71] Johannes Hedwig, the founder of the scientific knowledge of the\r\nMosses, was born at Kronstadt in Siebenbürgen in 1730. Having completed\r\nhis studies at Leipsic, he returned to his native town, but was not\r\npermitted to practice there as a physician because he had not taken\r\na degree in Austria. He consequently went back to Saxony and settled\r\nfirst at Chemnitz, and in 1781 in Leipsic. Here he was appointed in\r\n1784 to the Military Hospital, and became Professor extraordinary\r\nof Medicine in 1786 and ordinary Professor of Botany in 1789. He\r\ndied 1799. He commenced his botanical studies as a student at the\r\nUniversity, and continued them in Chemnitz under trying circumstances,\r\ntill as Professor he was free to devote himself entirely to them.\r\n\r\n[72] See P. Harting, ‘Das Mikroskop,’ §§ 433 and 434.\r\n\r\n[73] Johann Jakob Bernhardi, born in 1774, was Professor of Botany in\r\nErfurt, and died there in 1850.\r\n\r\n[74] Karl Asmus Rudolphi, born at Stockholm in 1771, was Professor of\r\nAnatomy and Physiology in Berlin, and died there in 1832.\r\n\r\n[75] Heinrich Friedrich Link was born at Hildesheim in 1767, and became\r\nDoctor of Medicine of Göttingen in 1788. In 1792 he became Professor\r\nof Zoology, Botany, and Chemistry in Rostock, Professor of Botany in\r\n1811 in Breslau, and in 1815 in Berlin, where he died in 1851. He was\r\na clever man of very varied accomplishment, but not a very accurate\r\nobserver of details, and was held in estimation by many chiefly as\r\na good teacher and philosophic author of popular works on natural\r\nscience. He was one of the few German botanists in the early part of\r\nthe present century who aimed at a general knowledge of plants, and\r\ncombined anatomical and physiological enquiries with solid researches\r\nin systematic botany. Of his many treatises on all branches of\r\nbotanical science, zoology, physics, chemistry, and other subjects,\r\nhis Göttingen prize essay must be considered to have contributed most\r\nto the advancement of science. Von Martius somewhat overrates his\r\nscientific importance in his ‘Denkrede auf H. F. Link’ in the ‘Gelehrte\r\nAnzeigen,’ München (1851), 58-69.\r\n\r\n[76] Ludolf Christian Treviranus, born at Bremen in 1779, became Doctor\r\nof Medicine of Jena in 1801, and practised at first in his native\r\ntown, where he became a teacher at the Lyceum in 1807. In 1812 he\r\naccepted the professorship in Rostock vacated by Link, and was again\r\nhis successor in Breslau. In 1830 he exchanged posts with C. G. Nees\r\nvon Esenbeck, who was a professor in Bonn; he died in that town in\r\n1864. In the first part of his life he occupied himself chiefly with\r\nvegetable anatomy and physiology, afterwards with the determination\r\nand correction of species. His first works, which are noticed in\r\nthe text, and the treatises on sexuality and the embryology of the\r\nPhanerogams, published between 1815 and 1828, are the most important\r\nin a historical point of view. His ‘Physiologie der Gewächse’ in two\r\nvolumes (1835-1838) is still of value for its accurate information on\r\nthe literature of the subject; but it can scarcely be said to have\r\ncontributed to the advance of physiology, for its author adhered in it\r\nto the old views, and especially to the notion of the vital force, at a\r\ntime when new ideas were already asserting themselves. The ‘Botanische\r\nZeitung’ for 1864, p. 176, contains a notice of his life.\r\n\r\n[77] Charles François Mirbel (Brisseau-Mirbel) was born at Paris in\r\n1776, and died in 1854. He began life as a painter, but having been\r\nintroduced by Desfontaines to the study of botany, he became Member\r\nof the Institute in 1808, and soon after Professor in the University\r\nof Paris. From 1816 to 1825 the cares of administration withdrew him\r\nfrom his botanical studies, but he resumed them and became in 1829\r\nProfesseur des cultures in the Museum of Natural History. Mirbel was\r\nthe founder of microscopic vegetable anatomy in France. All that had\r\nbeen accomplished there before his time was still more unimportant\r\nthan the work done in Germany. His writings involved him in many\r\ncontroversies, and he made enemies by refusing in his capacity of\r\nteacher to allow the importance at that time attributed to systematic\r\nbotany, but directed his pupils to the study of structure and the\r\nphenomena of life in plants. We are told by Milne-Edwards that he\r\nsuffered much from the fierce attacks which were made upon him; he\r\nsank at last into a weak and apathetic state, and was for some time\r\nbefore his death unable to continue his studies or official duties\r\n(‘Botanische Zeitung’ for 1855, p. 343).\r\n\r\n[78] Johann Jakob Paul Moldenhawer was Professor of Botany in Kiel; he\r\nwas born at Hamburg in 1766, and died in 1827.\r\n\r\n[79] On the doubts which were entertained till after 1812 on the\r\nsubject of stomata, see Mohl’s ‘Ranken und Schlingpflanzen’ (1827), p.\r\n9.\r\n\r\n[80] Franz Julius Ferdinand Meyen was born at Tilsit in 1804, and died\r\nas Professor in Berlin in 1840. He applied himself at first to pharmacy\r\nand afterwards to medicine, and having taken a degree in 1826 he\r\npractised for some years as a physician. In 1830 he set out on a voyage\r\nround the world under instructions from A. von Humboldt, and returned\r\nin 1832 with large collections. He was made Professor in Berlin in\r\n1834. There is a notice of his life in ‘Flora’ of 1845, p. 618.\r\n\r\n[81] Hugo Mohl (afterwards von Mohl) was born at Stuttgart in 1805,\r\nand died as Professor of Botany in Tübingen in 1872. His father held\r\nan important civil office under the Government of Würtemberg. Robert\r\nMohl, also in the service of the Government, Julius Mohl, the Oriental\r\nscholar, and Moritz Mohl, the political economist, were his brothers.\r\nThe instruction at the Gymnasium at Stuttgart, which he attended for\r\ntwelve years, was confined to the study of the ancient languages; but\r\nMohl early evinced a preference for natural history, physics, and\r\nmechanics, and devoted himself in private to these subjects. He became\r\na student of medicine in Tübingen in 1823, and took his degree in 1828.\r\nHe then spent several years in Munich in intercourse with Schrank,\r\nMartius, Zuccharini and Steinheil and obtained abundant material for\r\nhis researches into Palms, Ferns, and Cycads. He became Professor\r\nof Physiology in Berne in 1832, and Professor of Botany in Tübingen\r\nafter Schübler’s death in 1835, and there he remained till his death,\r\nrefusing various invitations to other spheres of work. He was never\r\nmarried, and his somewhat solitary life of devotion to his science was\r\nof the simplest and most uneventful kind. He was intimately acquainted\r\nwith all parts of botanical science, and possessed a thorough knowledge\r\nof many other subjects; he was in fact a true and accomplished\r\ninvestigator of nature. A very pleasing sketch of his life from the pen\r\nof De Bary is to be found in the ‘Botanische Zeitung’ of 1872, No. 31.\r\n\r\n[82] But von Mohl expressed some doubts on this point in 1844\r\n(‘Botanische Zeitung,’ p. 340).\r\n\r\n[83] This tertiary layer was at first supposed by Theodor Hartig to be\r\nof general occurrence; von Mohl in 1844 considered it to be present\r\nonly in certain cases.\r\n\r\n[84] Anselm Payen (1795-1871) was born at Paris and was Professor of\r\nIndustrial Chemistry in the École des Arts et Métiers in that city. His\r\nmost important botanical works were his ‘Mémoire sur l’amidon,’ etc.,\r\nParis (1839), and his ‘Mémoire sur le développement des Végétaux,’\r\npublished in the Memoirs of the Academy of Paris.\r\n\r\n[85] On this point, see von Mohl’s citation in ‘Flora’ of 1827, p. 13.\r\nI have not myself been able to consult the originals.\r\n\r\n[86] See Meyen, ‘Neues System,’ ii. 344.\r\n\r\n[87] Franz Unger was born in 1800 on the estate of Amthof, near\r\nLeutschach in South Steiermark, and was educated up to the age of\r\nsixteen in the Benedictine Monastery of Gratz. Having gone through the\r\nthree years’ course of ‘philosophy,’ he turned his attention, by his\r\nfather’s wish, to jurisprudence; but he abandoned this study in 1820,\r\nand became a student of medicine, first in Vienna, and afterwards in\r\nPrague. From the latter place he made a vacation tour in Germany, and\r\nformed the acquaintance of Oken, Carus, Rudolphi, and other men of\r\nscience, and in 1825 of Jacquin and Endlicher, with the latter of whom\r\nhe maintained an active correspondence on scientific subjects. Having\r\ntaken his degree in 1827, he practised as a physician in Vienna till\r\nthe year 1830, and after that date was medical official at Kitzbühl\r\nin the Tyrol. During these years he continued the botanical studies\r\nwhich he had commenced as a youth, and at Kitzbühl directed special\r\nattention to the diseases of plants, to palaeontological researches,\r\nand to enquiries into the influence of soil on the distribution of\r\nplants. At the end of 1835 he became Professor of Botany at the\r\nJohanneum in Gratz, and devoting himself there especially to the study\r\nof palaeontology, he soon became the most eminent authority on that\r\nsubject. Having been made Professor of Vegetable Physiology in Vienna\r\nin 1849, he applied himself more to physiology and phytotomy. He\r\nretired from this position in 1866, and from that time forward lived as\r\na private individual in Gratz, promoting scientific knowledge by the\r\npublication of popular treatises and the delivery of lectures. He died\r\nin 1870. Information respecting his personal character and his varied\r\nand copious labours in many departments of botanical science is given\r\nby Leitgeb in the ‘Botanische Zeitung’ of 1870, No. 16, and by Reyer,\r\n‘Leben und Wirken des Naturhistoriker Unger,’ Gratz, 1871.\r\n\r\n[88] Hermann Schacht was born at Ochsenwerder in 1824, and died in 1864\r\nin Bonn, where he had been Professor of Botany since 1859.\r\n\r\n[89] See Sachs, ‘Lehrbuch der Botanik,’ ed. 4 (1874), p. 129 (p. 128 of\r\n2nd English edition).\r\n\r\n[90] See Ernst Meyer, ‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ I. p. 98, &c.\r\n\r\n[91] The edition here used is that of Gottlob Schneider, ‘Theophrasti\r\nEresii quæ supersunt opera,’ Leipzig, 1818. See in addition to the\r\npassages noticed in the text the ‘De Causis,’ l. I. c. 13. 4, and l.\r\nIV. c. 4, and the ‘Historia Plantarum,’ l. II. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[92] It should be understood that neither Theophrastus nor the\r\nbotanists of the 16th and 17th centuries considered the rudiments of\r\nthe fruit to be part of the flower; this, which was pointed out in the\r\nhistory of systematic botany, seems to have been overlooked by Meyer,\r\n‘Geschichte,’ I. p. 164.\r\n\r\n[93] The passage is quoted in full in De Candolle’s ‘Physiologie\r\nvégétale,’ 1835, ii. p. 44. It is said there of the pollen, ‘Ipso et\r\npulvere etiam feminas maritare.’\r\n\r\n[94] See De Candolle, ‘Physiologie végétale,’ p. 47.\r\n\r\n[95] His ‘Methodus Herbaria’ is said to have been published in 1592.\r\nThe remarks in the text are made in reliance on a long quotation from\r\nit in Roeper’s translation of De Candolle’s ‘Physiologie,’ ii. p. 49,\r\nwho had before him an edition of 1604.\r\n\r\n[96] In the ‘Compositae,’ however, Grew called the single flowers the\r\nflorid attire, see p. 37.\r\n\r\n[97] We may compare with this, pp. 38 and 39 of the first part of the\r\nwork which appeared in 1671, where Grew ascribed no sexual significance\r\nto the stamens.\r\n\r\n[98] Rudolph Jacob Camerarius was born at Tübingen in 1665 and died\r\nthere in 1721. Having completed the course of study in philosophy\r\nand medicine, he travelled from 1685 to 1687 in Germany, Holland,\r\nEngland, France, and Italy. In 1688 he became Professor Extraordinary\r\nand Director of the Botanic Garden in Tübingen; in 1689 Professor\r\nof Natural Philosophy; and finally, in 1695, First Professor of the\r\nUniversity, in succession to his father, Elias Rudolph Camerarius. He\r\nwas afterwards succeeded by his son Alexander, one of ten children.\r\nThere is an article on Camerarius in the ‘Biographie Universelle,’\r\nfrom the pen of Du Petit-Thouars. His works on other subjects, as well\r\nas those on the question of sexuality in plants, are distinguished by\r\ningenious conception and lucid exposition.\r\n\r\n[99] See Patrick Blair’s ‘Botanic Essays,’ in two parts (1720), pp.\r\n242-276. Even the Latin ode is borrowed without acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n[100] The account in the text is taken from Koelreuter’s report in his\r\n‘Historie der Versuche über das Geschlechte der Pflanzen,’ as given\r\nat p. 188 of Mikan’s ‘Opuscula Botanici Argumenti.’ Logan’s work,\r\n‘Experimenta et Meletamata de Plantarum Generatione,’ unknown to me, is\r\nsaid by Pritzel to have been published at the Hague in 1739. Koelreuter\r\ncites from a London edition of 1747.\r\n\r\n[101] Koelreuter’s report in Mikan’s collection is again the authority\r\nwhich is here relied on.\r\n\r\n[102] Koelreuter says that he sent pollen of Chamaerops in 1766 to\r\nSt. Petersburg and to Berlin, where it was successfully employed by\r\nEckleben and Gleditsch. He wished to try how long the pollen retains\r\nits efficacy.\r\n\r\n[103] See Vol. II. p. 502, of the ‘Physiologie végétale.’\r\n\r\n[104] See Mikan, ‘Opuscula Botanici Argumenti,’ p. 180.\r\n\r\n[105] Joseph Gottlieb Koelreuter was born at Sulz on the Neckar in\r\n1733, and died at Carlsruhe in 1806, where he was Professor of Natural\r\nHistory, and from 1768 to 1786 Director also of the Botanic and\r\nGrand-ducal Gardens. On giving up the latter position he continued his\r\nexperiments in his own small garden till the year 1790. Karl Friedrich\r\nGärtner in his work ‘Ueber Bastardzeugung’ of 1849, at p. 5 says that\r\nafter the latter date Koelreuter occupied himself with experiments\r\nin alchemy; but this must be a mistake. Gärtner, loco cit., and the\r\n‘Flora’ of 1839, p. 245, supply all that seems to be known of the life\r\nof this distinguished man. The ‘Biographic Universelle’ contains no\r\naccount of him. It would appear that he was in St. Petersburg before\r\n1766.\r\n\r\n[106] See Gärtner, ‘Ueber Bastardzeugung’ (1849), p. 62. I have\r\nunfortunately been unable to meet with the second continuation of\r\nKoelreuter’s work.\r\n\r\n[107] Christian Konrad Sprengel, born in 1750, was for some time Rector\r\nat Spandau. There he began to occupy himself with botany, and devoted\r\nso much time to it that he neglected the duties of his office, and even\r\nthe Sunday’s sermon, and was removed from his post. He afterward lived\r\na solitary life in straitened circumstances in Berlin, being shunned by\r\nmen of science as a strange, eccentric person. He supported himself by\r\ngiving instruction in languages and in botany, using his Sundays for\r\nexcursions, which any one who chose could join on payment of two or\r\nthree groschen. He met with so little support and encouragement that\r\nhe never brought out the second part of his famous work; his publisher\r\ndid not even give him a copy of the first part. Natural disgust at the\r\nneglect with which his work was treated made him forsake botany and\r\ndevote himself to languages. He died in 1816. One of his pupils wrote a\r\nvery hearty eulogium on him in the ‘Flora’ of 1819, p. 541, which has\r\nsupplied the above facts.\r\n\r\n[108] See Hermann Müller, ‘Befruchtung der Blumen durch Insecten,’\r\nLeipzig (1873). p. 5.\r\n\r\n[109] Lazaro Spallanzani was born at Scandiano in Modena, and died\r\nat Pavia in 1799, where he was for a long time Professor of Natural\r\nHistory. He made researches in very various questions of natural\r\nscience, and especially in animal physiology; but they seem to have\r\nbeen conducted with the same want of care and deliberation which\r\nappears in his experiments on sexuality in plants. A long article in\r\nthe ‘Biographie Universelle’ gives a detailed account of his scientific\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\n[110] August Henschel was a practising physician and a University\r\nteacher in Breslau.\r\n\r\n[111] Karl Friedrich Gärtner, son of Joseph Gärtner, was born at Calw\r\nin 1772, and died there in 1850. He attended lectures on natural\r\nscience at the Carlsacademie at Stuttgart, and then went first to Jena\r\nfor medical instruction, and in 1795 to Göttingen, where he was a pupil\r\nof Lichtenberg. He took a degree in 1796 and settled as a physician\r\nin his native town. Here he occupied himself at first with questions\r\nof human physiology, and afterwards worked at the supplement to his\r\nfather’s ‘Carpologia.’ He collected notices and extracts for a complete\r\nwork on vegetable physiology. This design was never fulfilled, but it\r\nled to his taking up the question of sexuality in plants, to which\r\nhe devoted twenty-five years (‘Jahresheft des Vereins für vaterl.\r\nNaturkunde in Würtemberg,’ 1852, vol. viii, p. 16).\r\n\r\n[112] See also Sachs, ‘Lehrbuch der Botanik,’ Leipzig, 1874.\r\n\r\n[113] The more important works referred to in this section are Robert\r\nBrown’s ‘Miscellaneous Writings,’ edited by Bennett, 1866-67; von\r\nMohl on G. Amici, in the ‘Botanische Zeitung,’ 1863, Beilage, p. 7;\r\nSchleiden, ‘Ueber die Bildung des Lichens und Entsichung des Embryos,’\r\nin ‘Nova Acta Academiae Leopoldinensis,’ 1839, vol. xi, Abtheilung,\r\n1; Hofmeister, ‘Zur Uebersicht der Geschichte von der Lehre der\r\nPflanzenbefruchtung,’ in ‘Flora’ of 1867, p. 119.\r\n\r\n[114] The authorities for these statements are collected by Hofmeister\r\nin ‘Flora,’ 1857, p. 120, etc.\r\n\r\n[115] W. P. Schimper, in his ‘Recherches anatomiques et morphologiques\r\nsur les Mousses’ of 1850, had made some important statements respecting\r\nthe sterility of female moss-plants growing at a distance from male\r\nspecimens, and proved that the presence of male plants among females\r\nthat are otherwise barren renders them fruitful.\r\n\r\n[116] See the Fragments of Aristotelian phytology in Meyer’s\r\n‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ i. p. 120.\r\n\r\n[117] J. B. van Helmont was born at Brussels in 1577, and died at\r\nVillvorde near Brussels in 1644. He was a leading representative of the\r\nchemistry of his day. Kopp, in his ‘Geschichte der Chemie,’ 1843, i. p.\r\n117, has given a full account of his life and labours.\r\n\r\n[118] J. D. Major, who was born at Breslau in 1639, and died at\r\nStockholm in 1693, is quoted by Christian Wolff, as well as by\r\nReichel (‘De vasis plantarum.’ 1758, p. 4) and others, as the founder\r\nof the theory of circulation, which he propounded in 1665 in his\r\n‘Dissertatio Botanica de planta monstrosa Gottorpiensi,’ etc. Kurt\r\nSprengel (‘Geschichte der Botanik, ii. p. 7) classes him also among the\r\ndefenders of the doctrine of palingenesia, a superstitious belief in\r\nthe reproduction of plants and animals from their ashes, which was used\r\nto prove the resurrection of the dead.\r\n\r\n[119] He says, ‘in mediis vasculis reticularibus,’ which when taken in\r\nconnection with his general histology, must be understood to mean the\r\nbast-bundles.\r\n\r\n[120] The date of the birth of Edme Mariotte is not known. He was a\r\nnative of Burgundy, and lived in Dijon at the time of his earliest\r\nscientific labours. He was an ecclesiastic and became Prior of St.\r\nMartin sous Beaune near Dijon; he was a Member of the Academy of\r\nSciences in Paris from its foundation in 1666, and was one of the first\r\nFrenchmen who experimented in physics and applied mathematics to them.\r\nHe died in Paris in 1684 (‘Biographie Universelle’).\r\n\r\n[121] See the Fragments of Aristotelian phytology in Meyer’s\r\n‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ i. pp. 119, 125.\r\n\r\n[122] His views are known to me only from Magnol’s paper in the\r\n‘Histoire de l’Académie Royale des Sciences,’ 1709, and Sprengel’s\r\n‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ ii. 20. Perrault’s treatise is according to\r\nPritzel’s ‘Thesaurus’ of the date of 1680, but is published in the\r\n‘Œuvres divers de Perrault’ of 1721.\r\n\r\n[123] Especially in pages 1165, 1201, 2067, 2119.\r\n\r\n[124] Stephen Hales was born in the county of Kent in 1677 and was\r\neducated at home without showing any special ability. At the age of\r\nnineteen he became a member of Christ’s College in Cambridge, and there\r\nshowed his taste for physics, mathematics, chemistry, and natural\r\nhistory. Nevertheless he took orders and held Church preferment in\r\ndifferent counties. He became a Member of the Royal Society in 1718,\r\nand read before it his ‘Statical Essays.’ His ‘Hæmostatics’ appeared\r\nin 1733. He made and published other investigations and discoveries\r\nof very various kinds before his death in 1761. He was buried in his\r\nchurch at Riddington, which he had rebuilt at his own cost, and the\r\nPrincess of Wales caused an inscription to his memory to be placed in\r\nWestminster Abbey. See his Éloge in ‘Histoire de l’Académie Royale des\r\nSciences,’ 1762.\r\n\r\n[125] See Sprengel, ‘Geschichte der Botanik,’ i. 229, and Reichel’s and\r\nBonnet’s works mentioned below.\r\n\r\n[126] Georg Christian Reichel was born in 1727 and died in 1771. He was\r\nProfessor in the University of Leipsic.\r\n\r\n[127] Charles Bonnet, born at Geneva in 1720, sprang from a wealthy\r\nfamily, and was intended for the profession of the law, but gave\r\nhimself up from an early age to scientific pursuits, and especially to\r\nzoology. He was afterwards a member of the great council of Geneva,\r\nand wrote various treatises on scientific subjects, psychology, and\r\ntheology. He died on his properly at Genthod near Geneva in 1793. See\r\nthe ‘Biographie Universelle’ and Carus, ‘Geschichte der Zoologie,’ p.\r\n526.\r\n\r\n[128] See p. 35 of the German translation by Arnold, 1762.\r\n\r\n[129] Henri Louis du Hamel du Monceau was born at Paris in 1700\r\nand died in 1781. He had an estate in the Gatinais, and turned his\r\nstudies in physics, chemistry, zoology, and botany to account in the\r\ncomposition of a number of treatises on agriculture, the management of\r\nwoods and forests, naval affairs, and fisheries. He was made Member\r\nof the Academy in 1728 on presenting to it an essay on a disease then\r\nraging in the saffron-plantations, and caused by the growth of a fungus\r\n(‘Biographie Universelle’).\r\n\r\n[130] See Kopp, ‘Geschichte der Chemie’ (1843), i. p. 306, and\r\n‘Entwicklung der Chemie in der neucrenzeit’ (1873), p. 138.\r\n\r\n[131] Still less was gained from an observation made by Bonnet, that\r\nleaves exposed to sun-light in water containing air show bubbles\r\nof gas on their upper surface. Bonnet expressly denied the active\r\nparticipation of the leaves in the phenomenon, since the same thing\r\nhappens with dead leaves in water containing air.\r\n\r\n[132] Jan Ingen-Houss, physician to the Emperor of Austria, practised\r\nfirst in Breda, and afterwards in London. He was born at Breda in\r\nHolland in 1730, and died near London in 1799.\r\n\r\n[133] Jean Senebier, born at Geneva in 1742, was the son of a\r\ntradesman, and after 1765 pastor of the Evangelical Church. On his\r\nreturn from a visit to Paris he published his ‘Moral Tales,’ and at\r\nthe suggestion of his friend Bonnet competed for a prize offered at\r\nHaarlem for an essay on the Art of Observation. He was awarded the\r\nsecond place in this competition. In 1769 he became pastor at Chancy,\r\nand in 1773 librarian of Geneva. At this time, among other literary\r\nlabours, he translated Spallanzani’s more important writings; he also\r\nstudied chemistry under Tingry, and carried out his researches into the\r\ninfluence of light. In 1791 he wrote an article for the ‘Encyclopaedie\r\nméthodique’ on vegetable physiology. The revolution in Geneva drove him\r\ninto the Canton Vaud, and there he composed his ‘Physiologie végétale,’\r\nin five volumes. He returned to Geneva in 1799 and took part in a new\r\ntranslation of the Bible. He died in that city in 1809 (‘Biographie\r\nUniverselle’).\r\n\r\n[134] Nicolas Théodore de Saussure was born at Geneva in 1767, and died\r\nthere in 1845. He was the son of the famous explorer of the Alps, and\r\nassisted his father in his observations on Mont Blanc and the Col du\r\nGéant. In 1797 he wrote his treatise on carbonic acid in its relation\r\nto vegetation, a prelude to his ‘Recherches chimiques’; the latter\r\nwork received great attention from the scientific world, and he was\r\nmade a corresponding member of the French Institute. He was a man of\r\nliterary tastes, and took part also in public affairs, being repeatedly\r\nelected to the Council of Geneva. His preference for a secluded life\r\nis said to have been the reason why he never undertook the duties of a\r\nprofessorship. See the supplement to the ‘Biographie Universelle’ and\r\nPoggendorf’s ‘Biographisch-litterarisches Handwörterbuch.’\r\n\r\n[135] Henri Joachim Dutrochet, born in 1776, was a member of a noble\r\nfamily which belonged to the department of the Indre and lost its\r\nproperty during the revolution; he therefore adopted medicine as a\r\nprofession, and took his degree at the Faculty of Paris in 1806. He was\r\nattached to the armies in Spain as military surgeon in 1808 and 1809;\r\nbut he retired as soon as possible from practice and devoted himself in\r\ngreat seclusion to his physiological pursuits, living for some years in\r\nTouraine. He was made corresponding member of the Academy in 1819, and\r\ncommunicated his discoveries to that body. Becoming an ordinary member\r\nin 1831, he spent the winter months from that time forward in Paris.\r\nHe died in 1847 after two years’ suffering from an injury to the head.\r\nDutrochet was one of the most successful champions, in animal as well\r\nas vegetable physiology, of the modern ideas which displaced the old\r\nvitalistic school of thought after 1820. See the ‘Allgemeine Zeitung’\r\nfor 1847, p. 780.\r\n\r\n[136] See above on page 513.\r\n\r\n[137] Thomas Andrew Knight, President of the Horticultural Society, was\r\nborn at Wormsley Grange, near Hereford, in 1758, and died in London in\r\n1838.\r\n\r\n[138] See ‘Arbeiten des botanischen Institutes in Würzburg,’ vol. i. p.\r\n99.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's History of Botany (1530-1860), by Julius von Sachs",
