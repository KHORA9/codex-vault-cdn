QUAIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic and comprehensive theme in all American\r\nhistory is that of the westward movement. From the time of the first\r\nfeeble landings at Quebec, at Plymouth, and at Jamestown, the history\r\nof our country has been characterized by a steady westward surge of\r\nthe population, reaching out eagerly for new lands to conquer, and in\r\nthe process carrying the banner of civilization ever westward and\r\nestablishing successive new communities and states. The present\r\ngeneration of students of American history has not been unmindful of\r\nthe importance and interest which attaches to this westward movement,\r\nand has not failed to accord it, in the main, all due recognition.\r\nWith the doings and deserts of our pioneer farm, canal, railroad, and\r\ncity builders, our hewers of wood and drawers of water, in a word,\r\nhistorians have long made us familiar. Unfortunately, however, too\r\nlittle attention has been given, and too little recognition accorded,\r\nthe equally important service of those among our western pioneers who\r\nlaid the foundations of our spiritual and intellectual civilization.\r\nThat man may not live by bread alone was stated long ago on excellent\r\nauthority. The hewing down of the forests and breaking of the\r\nprairies, the building of houses, highways, and cities were all\r\nessential steps in the process of transforming the wilderness into an\r\nabode of enlightened civilization. Equally essential was the\r\nestablishment of institutions of learning and religion, and the\r\ndevelopment of a taste for literature and art. The blossoming of these\r\nfiner fruits of civilization inevitably tended to sweeten and refine\r\nthe society of the pioneers, which otherwise, engrossed in a stern\r\nphysical struggle with the wilderness, must have become hard and gross\r\nin character.\r\n\r\nFortunate indeed is the pioneer community which numbers among its\r\nsettlers intellectual and spiritual leaders fired with enthusiasm and\r\nendowed with ability. Fortunate it was for Wisconsin when in the very\r\nyear of her birth as a territory, Increase Allen Lapham cast his lot\r\nfor the remainder of his life with her. The service rendered by the\r\nintellectual aristocracy of pioneer Massachusetts and the other New\r\nEngland colonies has long been accorded ample recognition. The valiant\r\nlabors of Increase Lapham in the service of the state of his adoption\r\nhave largely gone unheeded and unrewarded to the present moment. Yet\r\nit is safe to predict that when the future historian shall come to\r\nscan the record of the first half century of Wisconsin’s history as a\r\nterritory and state, he will affirm that no man brought greater honor\r\nto her or performed more valuable services in her behalf than did the\r\nmodest scholar, Increase Allen Lapham.\r\n\r\nThe frontier has ever been proud of its self-made men, esteeming\r\nchiefly, not who a man might be but rather what he was able to do.\r\nLapham was a true frontiersman in this respect at least, that he was a\r\nwholly self-made scholar. He was born in March, 1811, at Palmyra, New\r\nYork, “two miles west of the Macedon locks on the Erie Canal.” His\r\nfather, Seneca Lapham, was an engineering contractor, the pursuit of\r\nwhose profession necessitated frequent family removals. Thus, in 1818\r\nthe family was located at Pottsville, Pennsylvania, where the father\r\nwas employed on the Schuylkill Canal; two years later he was back on\r\nthe Erie Canal and the family was residing for a second time at Galen,\r\nNew York; the next few years witnessed further removals to Rochester\r\nand Lockport in New York, and to several points in Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe boy, Increase Lapham, was evidently a precocious youth. At\r\nthirteen years of age he “found frequent sale” for his drawings of the\r\nplan of the locks his father had assisted in constructing at Lockport.\r\nAbout this time he gained employment, first at cutting stone for the\r\nlocks and then as rodman on the canal. While engaged in stonecutting,\r\nhe wrote in later years, “I found my first fossils and began my\r\ncollection. The beautiful specimens I found in the deep rock cut at\r\nthis place gave me my first ideas of mineralogy and initiated a habit\r\nof observation which has continued through all my life. I found\r\namusement and pastime in the study of nature, leading to long walks in\r\nthe country, and as I found no others of similar tastes these rambles\r\nwere usually without companions.”\r\n\r\nWhen fifteen years of age the youth followed his father to Ohio where\r\nhe worked for a short time on the Miami Canal, removing at the close\r\nof the year, 1826, to undertake similar employment at Louisville. At\r\nthis time, apparently, he first attracted the attention of members of\r\nthe world of scholarship, for we find the renowned scientist,\r\nProfessor Silliman of Yale, writing to thank him “for the liberal\r\nspirit which you manifest in encouraging a work designed to promote\r\nthe public good”--the work in question being the _American Journal of\r\nScience_, of which Silliman was the founder and editor. Within a few\r\nmonths the boy made his first contribution to scholarship by sending\r\nto Silliman, for publication in the _American Journal of Science_, a\r\ncomprehensive description of the canal around the Ohio Rapids.\r\n\r\nAt this time he was only sixteen, and his opportunities for schooling\r\nhad been exceedingly scant. Yet his habits of observation and his\r\npowers of reasoning and of expressing himself in clear and convincing\r\nEnglish might well be coveted by the average college undergraduate of\r\ntoday. A convenient illustration of these powers is afforded by\r\nLapham’s journal entry for October 24. 1827:\r\n\r\n     A smoky day. Mr. Henry, the engineer [of the canal], is of\r\n     the opinion that the smoke occasioning our Indian summer, as\r\n     the smoky weather is called, does not originate in the\r\n     burning prairies in the West, or in other extensive fires;\r\n     but that it is from the decay of vegetation. (If it is\r\n     possible for vegetables to be converted into smoke without\r\n     combustion this will appear very probable!!!!)\r\n\r\n     He relates an instance of a very smoky day at New Madrid\r\n     being followed by an earthquake; this he supposed to be the\r\n     smoke that had arisen through the ground. I told him that I\r\n     supposed it was owing to a peculiar state of the atmosphere\r\n     which was unfavorable to the decomposition of smoke; to this\r\n     he made no reply.\r\n\r\nThe years of Lapham’s youth and early manhood from 1827-36 must be\r\npassed in rapid review. Two years in all were spent on canal work at\r\nLouisville; over three more followed at Portsmouth, Ohio; in April,\r\n1833, the Ohio State Board of Canal Commissioners installed the young\r\nengineer (now twenty-two years of age) as its secretary at an annual\r\nsalary of $400. Thereafter for three years his headquarters were in\r\nthe state capitol at Columbus, his work being that of secretary of the\r\ncanal commission. Meanwhile the elder Lapham, advised and financially\r\nassisted by his sons, Darius and Increase, had abandoned the calling\r\nof canal contractor and settled upon a farm near Mount Tabor. This\r\nbecame the permanent family home, and here Seneca Lapham acquired a\r\nwell-deserved repute among his fellows both for his sobriety of\r\ncharacter and for his progressive ideas and practices with respect to\r\nfarming operations. In the years under review Increase Lapham\r\ncontinued to pursue with enthusiasm his scientific studies and\r\ninvestigations, the range of his interests and observations widening\r\nwith every passing year. Relations of acquaintance and friendship were\r\nestablished with a large number of scientific investigators, all of\r\nthem, doubtless, much older than was Lapham himself. The study of\r\nbotany and zoölogy, and investigations with respect to more scientific\r\nmethods of farming were begun. In a communication on “Agriculture in\r\nOhio,” contributed to the _Genesee Farmer_ in 1833, the modern\r\ndoctrine with respect to rotation of crops and scientific renovation\r\nof the soil through the use of fertilizers was laid down. A third of a\r\ncentury later, but still over a third of a century in advance of the\r\nrecent movement for the conservation of the natural resources of the\r\ncountry, Lapham followed up this general line of thought by writing\r\nand publishing as a Wisconsin legislative document a comprehensive\r\nargument in favor of the conservation of the state’s forest resources.\r\nHappy had it been for both state and nation if heed had been given in\r\ntime to the vital problem to which he thus early called attention.\r\n\r\nTo a practical application of the Jacksonian theory of spoils politics\r\nwas due the migration of Lapham from the capital of Ohio to the\r\nnew-born town of Milwaukee in the spring of 1836. In later years he\r\nhumorously explained that he was “reformed” out of office and\r\nemployment in Ohio; at the time, there is reason to believe, the blow\r\nwas not considered in a humorous light. Early in his canal career\r\nLapham had worked under Byron Kilbourn, who now had thrown in his\r\nfortunes with the rising young village of Milwaukee. As a leading\r\npromoter of the coming metropolis Kilbourn had extensive business\r\nprojects in view, among them that of procuring the construction of the\r\nMilwaukee and Rock River Canal, which would, it was fondly believed,\r\ngo far toward realizing for the nascent city her dreams of\r\nmetropolitan greatness. There was much demand for men possessed of\r\nengineering ability, and Kilbourn, who had conceived a friendship for\r\nLapham which was to prove lifelong, now brought him to Wisconsin on a\r\nsalary of $1,000 a year. Thus Wisconsin became his permanent home, for\r\nhe left Milwaukee only to remove in old age to a farm near Oconomowoc.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the Milwaukee River Lapham found, on his arrival on\r\nJuly 3, 1836, fifty houses where a few months before had been but two\r\nor three. In coming from the older settled portion of Ohio to\r\nMilwaukee he had entered a new world. Chicago was still in the height\r\nof its first mad speculative boom and conditions at Milwaukee differed\r\nonly in detail from those which prevailed at Chicago. Indeed, on\r\nreaching Detroit on his westward journey, Lapham wrote to his brother:\r\n“I am now, and have been since I arrived at Sandusky, in what might\r\nvery properly be called the world of speculators: everybody you meet\r\nis engaged in some speculation; everything you hear has some\r\nspeculation at the bottom. The hotel where I am now writing has\r\nsuspended on the walls of the barroom plats of new towns; I have added\r\nthe ninth.” No wonder the impecunious young man, engulfed in such an\r\natmosphere, proceeded, immediately upon his arrival at Milwaukee, to\r\npurchase three town lots for $5,000, payable “one-half in one one-half\r\nin two years.” How did he expect to provide the money to meet this\r\nobligation? He did not expect to provide it; he “bought them for the\r\npurpose of selling them again at a higher price.”\r\n\r\nLapham, however, was never designed for a business man, and he never\r\nacquired more than a very modest competence in life. I have spoken of\r\nthe speculative mania which then pervaded all the newer West merely to\r\nillustrate the sincerity of the young immigrant’s devotion to\r\nscholarship, from the pursuit of which even the thrill and\r\nintoxication of perhaps the greatest boom the country has ever\r\nwitnessed could detain him only momentarily. Within two weeks of his\r\narrival at Milwaukee he records that he has made a map of the county\r\n(possibly a professional matter) and “done a little botanizing.” Even\r\nearlier, while at Detroit en route to the West, he had taken time to\r\nwrite Professor Asa Gray an offer to collect for him specimens from\r\nthe new region to which the writer was going. “Let me entreat you to\r\npay particular attention to my _pets_, the grasses,” wrote the noted\r\nbotanist in reply; “I will see that you have due credit for every\r\ninteresting discovery.” Six weeks after his arrival at Milwaukee\r\nLapham wrote to another botanical friend that he found many new plants\r\nat Milwaukee; and that “in order to inform my friends of what plants\r\nare found here and to enable them to indicate such as they want I\r\nthink of publishing a catalogue of such as I find.”\r\n\r\nThus was conceived the idea responsible for the first publication of a\r\nscientific character within the bounds of the present state of\r\nWisconsin, for before the close of the year there issued from the\r\noffice of Milwaukee’s newly founded newspaper a _Catalogue of Plants\r\nand Shells, Found in the Vicinity of Milwaukee, on the West Side of\r\nLake Michigan_, by I. A. Lapham. It would probably be safe to affirm\r\nthat this was the first scientific work to be published west of the\r\nGreat Lakes, at least to the north of St. Louis. For in literary\r\nmatters Chicago, whose commercial progress Milwaukee never succeeded\r\nin equalling, must yield the palm of leadership to her early North\r\nShore rival. Leaving out of consideration one or two lyceum lectures\r\nwhich were printed after delivery, the earliest Chicago imprint of a\r\nscholarly character of which I have any knowledge is Mrs. Kinzie’s\r\nwell-known story of the Chicago massacre, published as a pamphlet in\r\n1844; and this, a reminiscent family narrative, does not deserve to be\r\nregarded as scholarly in the true sense of the term.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, two years after his arrival, Lapham began the collection of\r\nmaterial for a gazeteer of Wisconsin. Published at Milwaukee in 1844,\r\nit constitutes both Wisconsin’s first book of history and the state’s\r\nfirst home-made book of any character to be published in more durable\r\nbinding than paper. So attractive were its merits that an unscrupulous\r\nrival author, Donald McLeod, more adept at wielding the scissors than\r\nthe pen, promptly and brazenly plagiarized a large portion of its\r\ncontents for his _History of Wiskonsan_, published, appropriately\r\nenough, by “Steele’s Press” at Buffalo, in 1846: and a copy of this\r\nfraudulent publication was recently offered for sale by a dealer, with\r\ndue encomiums upon its rarity and worth, for the modest sum of thirty\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nThus far we have followed Lapham’s career in due chronological order.\r\nSome thirty years were yet to elapse before his death in 1875, years\r\ncrowded with earnest, self-effacing labors in the cause of\r\nscholarship. In what follows I shall treat of his various scholarly\r\ninterests and achievements in topical order, without regard to\r\nchronology.\r\n\r\nAlthough himself self-taught Lapham’s active interest in educational\r\ninstitutions persisted throughout his life. In 1843 he secured the\r\nadoption by the territorial legislature of a resolution to Congress\r\npetitioning a grant of land for the purpose of establishing in\r\nWisconsin an institution for the instruction of the deaf and dumb, and\r\nblind, and an asylum for the insane. He is the real father of the\r\nMilwaukee public high school system. In 1846 he donated thirteen acres\r\nof land lying within the city limits for the purpose of establishing\r\nthe first high school. In the spring of 1848 he was commissioned by\r\nthe city as its agent to secure a loan of $16,000 in the East for the\r\nbuilding of schoolhouses, and he made the long trip to New York and\r\nBoston on this public mission. In the same year he proffered the newly\r\nauthorized University of Wisconsin the gift of “a pretty extensive\r\nherbarium” of 1,000 or 1,500 species of plants. In March, 1848, by a\r\nmeeting of citizens held at the council house “it was deemed expedient\r\nto establish a college in this city” and an executive committee of\r\nfive townsmen was appointed with full power to consummate the desired\r\nobject. Lapham was one of the five men charged with this weighty\r\nresponsibility, and out of this movement proceeded the “Milwaukee\r\nFemale Seminary,” which today is represented by the Milwaukee-Downer\r\nCollege, one of the state’s noble institutions of higher learning. In\r\nAugust, 1850, as president of the executive board of the college,\r\nLapham had the satisfaction of delivering to its first two graduates\r\ntheir diplomas. When, in later years, he was offered a professorship\r\nin the school he declined the position, modestly explaining that his\r\nlack of education and of teaching experience rendered him unfit to\r\ndischarge the trust.\r\n\r\nWith our own State Historical Society his connection was long and\r\nhonorable. Before coming to Wisconsin he had actively engaged in the\r\nwork of the Ohio Historical and Philosophical Society. He hailed with\r\njoy the formation of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin in 1849\r\nand was one of the committee of three which drafted its first\r\nconstitution. The society being formally organized, he at once began\r\nto labor to promote its collections. He served as its vice-president\r\nfor twelve years, and as president for ten additional years. With the\r\nSmithsonian Institution he established relations of mutual helpfulness\r\nalmost immediately upon its organization. Of his relations with this\r\nand other learned institutions more will be said in connection with\r\ncertain lines of investigation which he carried on.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Dr. Lapham proposed to the American Antiquarian Society of\r\nWorcester, Massachusetts, to make an extensive survey of the mounds\r\nand other ancient remains in Wisconsin provided the society would\r\ndefray the actual outlay of money involved. The enterprise thus\r\nproposed was adopted by the Antiquarian Society, as a result of which\r\nthe survey was made, the fruits of it being given to the scientific\r\nworld a few years later in Lapham’s _Antiquities of Wisconsin_. This\r\nwork, published under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, is\r\nfilled with the author’s drawings, beautifully executed, of the\r\nnumerous earthworks and mounds he had located. Students of American\r\narcheology will always owe the patient author a heavy debt of\r\ngratitude for having carefully plotted and described these evidences\r\nof aboriginal habitation in Wisconsin before the work of destruction\r\nwhich inevitably attended the advance of white settlement had gained\r\nmuch headway.\r\n\r\nThus in many departments of learning--in geology, botany, conchology,\r\nin meteorology, history, and archeology--Lapham busied himself,\r\nacquiring repute among the scholars of Europe as in America, all the\r\nwhile earning his simple living by such professional work as he\r\npermitted himself the time to do. Perhaps no single achievement of his\r\npossesses more of interest to the world in general or has directly\r\nadded more to the well-being and comfort of every one of us than his\r\nwork in securing the establishment of a weather-service bureau by the\r\nnational government. It cannot be claimed that he fathered the idea of\r\nsuch a service and its attendant possibility of foretelling weather\r\nconditions far enough in advance to make the information of real\r\ncommercial value. Neither can Robert Fulton be credited with having\r\nfathered the idea of the steamboat. Yet we rightly regard Fulton as\r\nits real inventor, since he was the first to demonstrate the\r\npracticability of the idea. So with Lapham and the weather bureau. For\r\ntwenty years he urged upon the Smithsonian Institution, the Wisconsin\r\nlegislature, and other agencies of society the practicability and the\r\nimmense advantage of such a government service. For twenty years, as a\r\nprivate individual he made records and observations, seeking to\r\ndemonstrate his claims. But in the nature of the case (as Lapham\r\nrepeatedly pointed out) only some powerful agency like the national\r\ngovernment could take the many observations at different points\r\nnecessary to the success of the work, assemble their results, and make\r\nthem known throughout the nation in time to be of practical use to the\r\npublic. Finally, the persistent seeker after the public good succeeded\r\nin attracting the notice of men powerful enough to compel the\r\nattention of Congress. As a result the law for the incorporation of\r\nthe signal service was passed. How the result was achieved by Lapham\r\nmay best be told in the words of a man to whom he had appealed for\r\nassistance. At the meeting of the National Board of Fire Underwriters,\r\nheld in New York in April, 1875, a resolution to appoint a special\r\ncommittee to correspond with the United States Signal Service\r\nDepartment in relation to wind as an element in fire risks was under\r\nconsideration when Hon. E. D. Holton rose and said:\r\n\r\n     There is a little man who lives in my town about so high\r\n     (holding his hand a little lower than his shoulders) who\r\n     lives in an obscure part of the town, and is known to\r\n     comparatively few people in the town. You go to his house\r\n     and find it filled with all the evidences of science,\r\n     specimens from the vegetable world and the mineral world.\r\n     Going to London a few years ago I was given by this little\r\n     man a letter of introduction to Sir William Hooker,\r\n     custodian of the Kew Gardens, which secured for me eminent\r\n     entertainment and influence. Five years ago as I was about\r\n     to leave my house to go to Richmond, Virginia, to attend a\r\n     meeting of the National Board of Trade, he came to my house\r\n     and had a resolution drawn to be submitted to the National\r\n     Board of Trade, declaring that the national government\r\n     should organize a service to _look after the winds of the\r\n     continent of America_.\r\n\r\n     When I came to Richmond I presented that resolution. It\r\n     received a most eloquent second from the late General\r\n     Wolbridge, an eminent citizen of New York. The National\r\n     Board of Trade immediately passed the resolution. As soon as\r\n     it was passed I sent it to my friend, General Paine, then\r\n     member of Congress from my district in Wisconsin, and in an\r\n     incredibly short space of time for that august body--which\r\n     is supposed to have at least as much red tape as the\r\n     National Insurance Company--it was passed. I did not expect\r\n     that the wind question would meet me at this angle of the\r\n     insurance trade, but it seems it has.\r\n\r\n     That gentleman I will name. I rise to make these remarks and\r\n     I wish to speak his name in this connection, because out of\r\n     his labors so persistent, in his humble house, so unknown to\r\n     his countrymen--for he is better known in foreign circles of\r\n     science than in his own country--and through his labors and\r\n     instrumentality, this thing has been brought into its\r\n     present shape. His name is Dr. Increase Allen Lapham of\r\n     Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nAnd how, it may be asked, did Lapham’s fellow-men requite his lifelong\r\nlabors devoted to the public good? The answer which must be made\r\naffords much support to the proverbial belief in the ungratefulness of\r\nrepublics. When in 1870 Congress passed the bill providing for the\r\nweather-signal service, its execution was entrusted to the chief\r\nsignal officer of the army. By him Lapham was employed for a short\r\ntime as special assistant in the War Department at a yearly salary of\r\n$2,000. When he sent home (he was stationed at Chicago) to his\r\ndaughter the proceeds of his first month’s wages, she wrote to her\r\nbrother as follows:\r\n\r\n     Last Friday father sent home $128.03 to be deposited as the\r\n     first money of any amount he ever received for any\r\n     scientific occupation (regular salary at least) and Thursday\r\n     afternoon I was down town and met B. He said he had been\r\n     around among some of father’s friends and collected $100 to\r\n     make father a life member of the Chicago Astronomical\r\n     Society--(You know this society owns the “big telescope” at\r\n     Dearborn Observatory).\r\n\r\nI forbear to quote the daughter’s delighted remarks which follow; more\r\nprofitable will it be for us to consider for a moment the bitter irony\r\nof this situation. After more than forty years of zealous public\r\nservice to receive so pitiful a salary, his first tangible reward, and\r\nto have this discontinued within a few months time! To be fitted both\r\nby inherent tastes and lifelong training to enjoy and profit by\r\nmembership in such an association, and yet unable, because our\r\ncountrymen estimate the services of scholars so low, to pay the paltry\r\nmembership fee! Here, indeed, is the cross on which in the United\r\nStates today we crucify scholarship.\r\n\r\nOne other matter and I shall conclude. Before he left Ohio Dr. Lapham\r\nhad labored to induce the legislature to make provision for a\r\ngeological survey of that state. From the time of his arrival in\r\nWisconsin he strove as an individual to carry out such a survey here.\r\nNecessarily in order to do it thoroughly and to publish its results\r\nthe power of the state must be brought into play. At length in 1873\r\nprovision was made by statute for a geological survey of Wisconsin and\r\nGovernor Washburn appointed Dr. Lapham chief geologist to have the\r\ndirection of the enterprise. The work was pushed vigorously and\r\nefficiently throughout the seasons of 1873 and 1874. Suddenly, in\r\nJanuary, 1875, Governor Taylor removed Dr. Lapham in order to make a\r\nplace for one of his spoils-seeking supporters. According to the\r\n_American Journal of Science_ the new geologist’s “sole recommendation\r\nfor the position was political services, no one having ever heard of\r\nhim before as acquainted with geology or any other science.” Thus\r\nfinally did our state requite its first scholar--first certainly from\r\nthe viewpoint of chronology, and probably first from every other\r\nviewpoint. “Knowing that time, which cures all things,” wrote the\r\nthree assistant geologists he had chosen two years before, “will do\r\nyou ample justice, and feeling most strongly the irreparable loss that\r\nthe state has sustained in the disseverment of your connection with\r\nthe survey, we remain with the most sincere respect, Your obedient\r\nservants.” As an indication of the quality of the assistants selected\r\nby Dr. Lapham it may be noted that one of the men who thus testified\r\nthis appreciation of their deposed chief was Thomas Chrowder\r\nChamberlin, who has been for many years chief geologist of the\r\nUniversity of Chicago.\r\n\r\nTime indeed cures all things, notwithstanding that the mills of the\r\ngods grind slowly. Of Dr. Lapham’s spoilsman successor as chief\r\ngeologist of Wisconsin, it may still be said, as at the time of his\r\nappointment, that his reputation as a scientist yet remains to be\r\nmade. Governor Taylor, who made the removal, sleeps in silent Forest\r\nHill within sight of the capitol where formerly he ruled a state;\r\nwhile in the holy of holies of the beautiful new state capitol, the\r\ngovernor’s reception chamber, in the midst of famous soldiers,\r\nexplorers, and legislators, an eminent artist has chosen to depict the\r\napplication of scientific knowledge to the benefit of mankind in the\r\nperson of Doctor Lapham seated at his desk, before him an open\r\nmanuscript, and on the wall nearby, supported by two children\r\ntypifying the winds, his map of the United States, showing the first\r\nstorm traced across the country. More recently still, prompted by the\r\nurging of citizens of the locality, the federal government has given\r\nto the highest eminence in Waukesha County, overlooking the beautiful\r\nlake region which Dr. Lapham so loved in life, the name of Lapham\r\nPeak. Time is slowly proving his worth. More fitting memorials than\r\nthese he could not have asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FOREST FIRE IN NORTHERN WISCONSIN\r\n\r\nBY JOHN L. BRACKLIN[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been running a steamboat on Lake Chetak and Birch Lake in Sawyer\r\nCounty, Wisconsin, during the summer of 1898 and had finished my work\r\nSeptember 25. I arrived in Rice Lake with the expectation of having a\r\ncouple of weeks’ rest before again taking up my duties as foreman of\r\none of Knapp, Stout, and Company’s logging camps for the winter. I had\r\nbeen in town one day, about long enough to get cleaned up, when I went\r\ndown to the company’s office to draw some money. While I was in the\r\ngeneral office some one said: “Your father wants to see you in his\r\noffice.” I walked into his office and sat down. He had a map showing\r\ncamp locations and other data spread out on the desk before him, which\r\nhe studied for a few moments and then turned to me, saying: “John, how\r\nsoon can you get ready to go to the woods?” This, as you know, could\r\nhave but one answer, and that was, “Now!” “All right,” he said, “I am\r\nsomewhat alarmed about this long-continued dry spell and fires might\r\nspring up at any moment, and none of the camps or dams in your\r\nlocality have any fire protection, such as back-firing and\r\nwater-barrels at hand. Therefore I wish you would pick up a few men\r\nand whatever you might need and get up to your camp, make your\r\nheadquarters there, and look after the camps in that vicinity, namely:\r\nMulvaney’s, Aronson’s, Knutson’s, Max Down’s, Thompson’s, and the old\r\nAhern Camp on Sucker Creek.”\r\n\r\nI swallowed the disappointment of a contemplated trip to Minneapolis\r\nto see the only girl I ever thought very much of, whom I had not seen\r\nfor about eight months, and stepping over to the shipping clerk’s\r\ndesk, I wrote up a list of food supplies and a requisition for a team\r\nto move the same, expecting to start the following morning. I went out\r\non the street to pick up some men and came across Lee Miller and Frank\r\nWirth, inseparable pals, who had worked for me the previous winter. I\r\nasked them how soon they would be ready to go to the woods, and they\r\nsaid, “Right now.” “All right,” said I, “pack your sacks and be here\r\nat six in the morning, and we will load the team and go.” While we\r\nwere talking, another man came along, Julius Peterson by name, a\r\nhunchback, who, notwithstanding his deformity, was considered one of\r\nthe best sawyers that ever felled a tree. He also was willing to start\r\nimmediately, so I went over to the hotel and wrote the only girl--who,\r\nby the way, has been my wife for the past seventeen years--that I\r\nwould have to defer that visit for another seven or eight months. I\r\ngot my clothes packed again, and at six-thirty the following morning\r\nwe were on our way to my camp at the head of Birch Lake, a distance of\r\nabout thirty miles.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Cedar Lake Dam for dinner and at camp about eight\r\no’clock the night of September 27, 1898. We opened the door of the\r\ncook-shanty very cautiously, so as not to disturb a family of skunks\r\nwho yearly took up their abode under the floors of the camps during\r\nthe summer months. They did not approve of being disturbed, and from\r\npast experiences we decided not to make any unnecessary noise, such as\r\nmoving tables and heavy boxes along the floors, until such time as\r\nthey might be more accustomed to our presence. We built a fire in the\r\nstove and made some coffee, and after what we called a “store-feed,”\r\nconsisting of cheese, crackers, and sardines, we spread our blankets\r\nupon the floor to sleep as only men of that day could. We arose about\r\nfive-thirty on the morning of the twenty-eighth, had another\r\nstore-breakfast, unloaded the wagon, and started the team back to\r\ntown. Then the great question confronted us as to who was to do the\r\ncooking. The regular cook for the winter, Herman Gottschalk, could not\r\nbe had for at least two weeks, as he was cooking for the rafting-crews\r\nat Reed’s Landing. Frank Wirth finally agreed to a compromise: he was\r\nto do the cooking until such time as the first man should kick and\r\nthen said man was to cook until someone else should kick, to which we\r\nall agreed.\r\n\r\nLeaving Wirth at the camp to cook up a regular dinner, Miller,\r\nPeterson, and I left for Mulvaney’s Camp to see what condition it\r\nwould be in, if we had the unexpected fire. We arrived there about ten\r\no’clock and opened up the blacksmith shop, got out empty barrels,\r\ncooking utensils, and everything that would hold water, and started\r\nMiller out to round up a couple of yokes of cattle. He returned in an\r\nhour or so with about ten head. We selected two yokes out of the bunch\r\nand, hooking them up to a breaking-plow, plowed about a dozen furrows\r\naround the camp, after which we turned them loose. They immediately\r\nstarted off in a westernly direction, which you may call animal\r\ninstinct if you will, for we afterward found that to be the only\r\npossible direction they could have taken and evaded the fire, which\r\nunbeknown to us was so soon to follow. We sat down and smoked our\r\npipes and joked about the unnecessary precaution of filling the\r\nbarrels, as at that time it was one of the prettiest autumn days I\r\nhave ever seen, not a cloud in the sky, not a breeze stirring, no sign\r\nof smoke anywhere, and no possible chance, apparently, of there ever\r\nbeing a fire. Nevertheless, we were carrying out instructions and we\r\nset to work to fill up the barrels, which took about an hour.\r\n\r\nWe had just filled the barrels on the roof of the long barns, when\r\nMiller, who was on top of one of the barns, called my attention to a\r\ncloud of smoke that had suddenly sprung up on the horizon about five\r\nor six miles to the south and west of us. I climbed up on the roof of\r\nthe barn, where I could get a better view. The wind suddenly arose and\r\nwithin ten minutes it had attained the velocity of a cyclone; what\r\nfollowed happened so quickly it has never as yet been quite clear to\r\nme. I can remember the black cloud settling down and in less time than\r\nit takes to write this, the fire was upon us--not on the ground as you\r\nmight imagine, but in the air. The heat became terrific and the first\r\nsign of a blaze sprang up in the top of a broken stump about twenty\r\nfeet in height and a hundred feet from the sleeping-shanty.\r\n\r\nI jumped off the roof of the barn, grabbed up a water bucket, Peterson\r\ndoing the same, and ran for the sleeping-shanty, a distance of about\r\n150 feet. Before we could reach it, it was afire. We threw several\r\nbuckets of water upon it, but the water might have been kerosene for\r\nall the good it did. Seeing it was useless to try to save the\r\nsleeping-shanty or the cook-shanty, which were only a few feet apart,\r\nwe ran back to the barns, thinking to save them. This may sound\r\ndubious, but it all happened within twenty minutes of the time we\r\nfirst saw smoke four or five miles away. As quickly as we reached the\r\nbarn I motioned to Miller to dump the barrels of water which we had\r\nplaced there; those buildings, if you remember them, were each about\r\nsixty feet in length, standing parallel, with a hay shed between,\r\nwhich contained about ten tons of baled hay left over from the\r\nprevious winter. While Miller ran to the far end of the barn,\r\nupsetting the six or seven barrels as he ran, Peterson and I were\r\nthrowing water on the hay shed. I don’t suppose we had thrown more\r\nthan ten or twelve buckets when the roof of the barn took fire. As I\r\nsaid before, the fire seemed to be in the very air, for strange as it\r\nmay seem, the dry grass and leaves around the buildings were not yet\r\nburned. In less than a minute the roof was afire from one end to the\r\nother. I motioned to Miller to jump off. He did so and ran towards me.\r\nWhen he got near enough so that I could hear, he yelled: “What in hell\r\nwill we do now, and which way will we go?”\r\n\r\nThen for the first time I realized the danger we were in. A glance\r\naround showed only one way open and that was due north towards a wall\r\nof virgin green timber, a distance of about 500 yards. The ground\r\nbetween us and the edge of the timber had been logged the previous\r\nwinter, leaving treetops and brush piled up here and there in great\r\nheaps--you know how it would look after being logged. How we got to\r\nthe edge of the timber I can hardly remember, but in the excitement I\r\nstill had the empty water-bucket in my hand. We reached the timber to\r\nfind that the fire had beaten us. Perhaps a burning brand from one of\r\nthe buildings had dropped just at the edge of the timber among the dry\r\nleaves and had burned a strip of ground about 200 feet in width,\r\nleaving the ground perfectly bare. Luckily for us the timber was\r\ngreen, with no underbrush to hold the fire, for when we reached there,\r\nthere was nothing left on the ground but the smouldering ashes of the\r\nleaves. We stopped to get our breath, and then it dawned upon us how\r\nuseless it was to run. I said to Miller, “If we ever get out of this,\r\nit will be by staying right here.” He gave me one look, which I shall\r\nnever forget, as much as to say, “Man, you are crazy,” and again\r\nstarted to run, Peterson following. I then turned and looked back\r\nwhence we had come. There was a solid wall of fire similar to a great\r\nwave, extending as far to each side as one could see and mounting\r\nfifty feet in height. It is hard to express just what my feelings\r\nwere, but I remember that I ceased to be afraid, knowing that our time\r\nhad come, there being not a possible chance to come out alive. The\r\nmain body of the fire by that time had reached a point about where the\r\ncamps had stood. I was almost tempted to start to run, when I turned\r\nto find Miller and Peterson again at my side. They had run only a\r\nshort distance into the tail end of the advance fire and had come\r\nback. I remember Miller lying on his face on the ground with his head\r\nstuck into a hole that he had dug out with his hands. The ground at\r\nthe roots of the trees was damp, and the only way we could breathe was\r\nby lying on the ground, for when we stood up the heat and smoke were\r\nso thick we could not breathe.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to hear people relate their experiences and close\r\nencounters with death. After hearing them, I can judge just how close\r\nthey really have been to real death. For as I see it, it has four\r\nstages--first, the excitement; then fear; then resolution; then death\r\nitself. At about this time we had reached the point of resolve; Miller\r\nand Peterson were on their knees praying, while as for myself,\r\nnothwithstanding I have lived a somewhat better life since, I\r\nconcluded that as I had never asked God for anything prior to that, it\r\nwas a very poor time to start in now that I was about to die. So I\r\nconcluded to go just as I was, believing, as I still do, that a\r\ndeath-bed confession would avail me nothing. You can best realize our\r\nposition when I tell you that we were never over four feet apart for\r\nat least four hours and during that period there was not one word\r\nexchanged among us. At the end of that time I was standing leaning up\r\nagainst a tree. Other trees were falling all around us, and as I stood\r\nthere wishing one might fall on me and end it all, it started to rain.\r\nIt must have poured, for before I realized what had happened I was wet\r\nto the skin. That brought me back to my senses and I realized that I\r\nwas alive and that I still wanted to live. I ran a short distance and\r\nit came to me like a flash that I was going the wrong way to get out.\r\nI turned and ran back, and as I ran, stumbled over Peterson, who was\r\nstill on his knees. The first word to break the dull silence of those\r\nhours was spoken then, when he said, “What in hell are you trying to\r\ndo?” We made our way out to the old tote road, and after walking about\r\na mile west, got out of the range of the fire.\r\n\r\nWe made our way back to camp to find Wirth all excited. His greeting\r\nwas, “Gee, you ought to have been here this afternoon, for everything\r\nat the dam”--meaning Birch Lake dam--“has burned, camps and all, for\r\nI could see the hay stacks as they would catch fire and the flames\r\nshoot up in the air hundreds of feet.” Then the thought flashed upon\r\nme: The dam, suppose it should burn out. With an eleven-foot head of\r\nwater on Birch Lake and Big Chetak, what would happen to the country\r\nbelow? Miller and Peterson being all in, I asked Wirth if he would go\r\nwith me and try to make the dam. The rain had lasted only about half\r\nan hour and the fire, which had again got under way, but with no wind,\r\nwas fortunately not burning as furiously as earlier in the day. The\r\nroad to the dam took us back into the edge of the fire, but on making\r\nseveral detours we reached the dam to find both wings afire. Pete\r\nNull, and four or five men who had been stationed there at the Birch\r\nLake Camp, were making a desperate fight to save the dam, but they\r\nwere almost played out, having fought in vain all afternoon to save\r\nthe camps.\r\n\r\nOne glance and I saw what to do. Wirth and I picked up a couple of\r\npeavies, and climbing down to the apron, ripped up four or five planks\r\nand stuck them on end down under the bed plates, or stringers, leaving\r\nthem standing pointing up stream at an angle of forty-five degrees. We\r\nthen climbed back upon the dam and raised the gate four or five\r\ninches. When the current struck those planks it threw a spray of water\r\nall over both wings of the dam and inside of ten minutes we had the\r\nfire completely out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP PREPARED BY MR. BRACKLIN TO ILLUSTRATE HIS\r\nNARRATIVE]\r\n\r\nWe all sat down and rested for about half an hour; then Wirth and I\r\ntook a boat and rowed back to camp, a distance of about two miles.\r\nWhen we reached there, about midnight, the rain set in and it rained\r\nuntil noon the following day. Miller and Peterson were still unable to\r\nmove around much, as their faces and hands were badly blistered and\r\ntheir eyes pained them terribly. As for myself, aside from being\r\nunable to speak above a whisper, I was in pretty good shape, and\r\nknowing it would only be a couple of days until father, as soon as he\r\ncould reach us, would be there to look the situation over--plans for\r\nthe coming winter of logging would have to be changed to include all\r\nthe timber that had been burned, for in that country a tree though\r\nslightly burned would be worm-eaten inside of a year unless cut--I\r\nstarted out with Wirth the next morning to find, if we could, just how\r\nfar the fire had extended east and west and to look up a site for a\r\ncamp to replace the Mulvaney Camp which had burned. We found that the\r\nfire had taken a course similar to that of a cyclone, about three\r\nmiles in width and about twenty miles in length, extending from a\r\npoint four miles south and west of Cedar Lake Dam, crossing the\r\nnarrows between Cedar Lake and Hemlock up the east shore of Cedar Lake\r\nto a point about opposite Stout’s Island, and then north to the shores\r\nof Big Chetak just west of the Aronson Camp in Section 4--in all an\r\narea of about seventeen miles in length and two to four miles in\r\nwidth.\r\n\r\nFather and L. S. Tainter arrived the next day and after looking over\r\nthe site for the new camp we came back to the scene of our experience\r\nof a few days before. We had about reached the point when father\r\nturned to me saying, “John, did I understand you to say you were here\r\nduring this fire?” I answered “Yes.” He looked at me for a moment\r\nwith, you will remember, that peculiar squint of his and then he said,\r\n“John, you lie, for no man could have been here when this fire passed\r\nand lived to tell the tale.” Nevertheless we were there, and are still\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [1] The author of this narrative is a native of Rice Lake,\r\n     Wisconsin.

KELLOGG\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the firing upon Fort Sumter aroused the North, all\r\neyes were turned upon New York, not only as the monetary center of the\r\ncountry, but as a city most closely allied in financial interests with\r\nthe South. The moneyed men of that city responded to the country’s\r\ndanger. Upon the stock exchange cheers were given for Major Anderson,\r\nand April 17, 1861, resolutions were passed pledging the loyalty of\r\nthe institution to the government. Anderson and his command from Fort\r\nSumter reached New York on April 18, and on Saturday, April 20, a\r\nmonster mass-meeting was held in Union Square, where five speaker’s\r\nstands had been erected. The resolutions adopted at this meeting not\r\nonly pledged the loyalty of the city, but provided for a Union Defense\r\nCommittee, comprising thirty of the most prominent financiers and\r\nbankers headed by General John A. Dix, recently secretary of the\r\ntreasury under President Buchanan. The mayor and the comptroller of\r\nthe city were ex-officio members of this committee. The city council\r\nappropriated $1,000,000 for the immediate needs of the New York\r\ntroops, and raised the funds by the sale of Union Defense bonds. The\r\nCommittee of Union Defense acted ex-officio as a federal agent,\r\nattending to the equipment and dispatching of regiments, purchasing\r\nsteamers for transportation, feeding and sheltering the troops,\r\nwithout waiting for the action of the federal authorities. At one time\r\nthree members of the committee were entrusted with $2,000,000 federal\r\nmoney without security or compensation. By these means the Seventh New\r\nYork\r\n\r\nRegiment was dispatched for the protection of Washington, and other\r\ntroops were moved toward the front. The Union Defense Committee was\r\nmaintained for about one year. Its later duties were concerned with\r\nthe care of funds raised for the benefit of the volunteers and their\r\nfamilies. It collected and disbursed for this purpose about\r\n$1,000,000.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the city banks were loyally endeavoring to prevent a\r\nfinancial crisis. April 25, 1861 they determined to hold all their\r\nspecie as a common fund, this being a precautionary measure to sustain\r\npublic confidence. There were in New York City fifty-four banks with a\r\ncapital of $69,907,000. Much of their paper was held in the southern\r\nstates, where debts to northern holders were quickly repudiated.\r\nNevertheless, in the entire state of New York only five banks\r\nsuspended during 1861, and none of these in New York City.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of New York, the banks of Boston and\r\nPhiladelphia pooled all their cash reserves. The Boston banks, of\r\nwhich there were forty-two, with a capital of $38,231,000, and which\r\nhad a clearing-house system, aided in preventing an immediate panic.\r\n\r\nWestern banks were less well prepared to meet the emergency. Most of\r\nthem held southern state bonds as the basis of their currency system.\r\nDuring 1861 bank after bank went to the wall, and the notes of others\r\ndepreciated with startling rapidity.\r\n\r\nAll the banks of that period were either state banks or private\r\nbanking concerns. The national banking-system did not come into being\r\nuntil 1863. The first (though indirect) aid furnished by the banks in\r\nthe national crisis of 1861 was the preservation of their own\r\nintegrity, and therewith the entire credit system of the North, from\r\ncollapse. This was accomplished through the instrumentality of the\r\nbanks of the three chief cities of the East--New York, Boston, and\r\nPhiladelphia. In the West, a few banks in Cincinnati, Chicago, and\r\nMilwaukee were strong enough to support the situation, even while the\r\nlarger part of the western banks went to the wall.\r\n\r\nThe direct aid furnished by the banks and bankers of the country to\r\nthe state and federal governments during the early years of the Civil\r\nWar may be classified under the three heads of contributions, loans,\r\nand agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRIBUTIONS\r\n\r\nThe call for troops awoke a patriotic fervor in many hearts, which led\r\nto an offering of money as well as of men. In this outpouring of gifts\r\nthe bankers took their part, some giving as individuals, many in the\r\nname of their institutions. No complete record of these patriotic\r\ncontributions is available. _Harper’s Weekly_ of May 25, 1861,\r\nestimated that the individual gifts of more than $1,000 from counties,\r\ncities, societies, corporations, and other organizations totaled\r\n$27,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOANS\r\n\r\nThe first necessity was that of temporary loans for both the state and\r\nfederal governments.\r\n\r\n_Temporary loans to states._ Patriotic impulse prompted the immediate\r\noffering of loans by the banks. In Massachusetts the bankers of Boston\r\ntendered the state government a loan up to ten per cent of their\r\ncombined capital. In Illinois the banks of Springfield offered the\r\nstate $100,000 on the day Lincoln called for troops. This was\r\nsupplemented by the Chicago banks’ tender of $500,000. Throughout the\r\nearly days of the war the banks in all localities were called upon for\r\nloans on the credit of the state. These were funded at seven per cent,\r\nthen the usual interest for such transactions.\r\n\r\n_Temporary loans to the federal government._ The treasury of the\r\nUnited States was in a desperate condition at the outbreak of the\r\nCivil War. Lacking resources even for its daily needs, it was totally\r\nunprepared for the great strain immediately placed upon it. Secretary\r\nChase did not have recourse to the bankers, however, until after the\r\nbattle of Bull Run in July had proved that the war was not to be an\r\naffair of “three months.”\r\n\r\nOn the day that the news of the defeat at Bull Run reached\r\nPhiladelphia, a young banker recently removed to that city from Ohio,\r\nan ardent partisan of Secretary Chase, drew up a paper offering to\r\nadvance to the Secretary of the Treasury specified sums for sixty days\r\nat six per cent interest, returnable in specie or interest-bearing\r\ntreasury notes. With this proposal he visited the principal banks and\r\nfinancial houses in his city, and raised for immediate government\r\nneeds nearly $2,000,000 in one day. Chase was interested and grateful,\r\nand the fortunes of Jay Cooke, the young banker, were made from that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1862, when the government’s daily needs were increasing\r\nenormously, John J. Cisco, assistant treasurer of the sub-treasury at\r\nNew York, made arrangements for a loan from the city banks of their\r\ntemporarily idle funds. These were received on deposit for thirty\r\ndays, subject to withdrawal thereafter on ten days’ notice. At first\r\nCisco by this means secured much specie at four per cent; later, five\r\nand six per cent were paid for these advances. This money was largely\r\nused for the payment of the interest on the public debt. One banker in\r\nNew York, it is said, became uneasy after lending the sub-treasury\r\n$1,000,000, and demanded its return. Cisco told him to send his carts\r\nfor it immediately. The next day his faith in the government was\r\nrestored and he concluded to leave his reserve with the sub-treasurer.\r\n\r\nAn instance of immediate aid to the government’s foreign diplomats is\r\nrelated in the biography of the late J. Pierpont Morgan. Morgan was in\r\nLondon on business for his house at a time when Charles Francis Adams\r\nwas endeavoring to prove to the English government that certain\r\nvessels fitting in British ports were intended for Confederate\r\nprivateers. The officials were slow to accept Adams’ proofs, and he\r\nwas much alarmed lest the commerce-destroyers should get to sea before\r\nhe had succeeded in having an embargo placed on their departure. The\r\nBritish authorities finally agreed to detain the ships on condition\r\nthat Adams should deposit £1,000,000 guarantee to indemnify the\r\ngovernment should the owners not prove to be Confederates. Adams was\r\nin a dilemma: he could not well refuse such a proposition, but long\r\nbefore he could receive the money from America the cruisers would be\r\nat sea. He tried to borrow on his personal credit from London bankers,\r\nonly to be rebuffed. Young Morgan heard of the situation, sought the\r\nambassador, and promised to deliver $5,000,000 in gold into his hands\r\nin two days, asking only his personal receipt in return, while\r\nstipulating absolute secrecy concerning his patriotic action. In this\r\nwise two of the commerce-destroyers were detained in port, and the\r\nintegrity of the American ambassador was vindicated.\r\n\r\n_Secured, or long-time, loans to states._ Upon the news of the firing\r\non Fort Sumter and the subsequent call for troops every northern\r\nlegislature then in session appropriated a fund for war purposes.\r\nIndiana, for example, voted $500,000 for arms and equipment, and\r\n$100,000 for a contingent fund. Connecticut made an issue of $800,000\r\nof war bonds. These funds were raised in various ways. In\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut they were offered for popular\r\nsubscription and sold at par. The western states placed their bonds on\r\nthe New York stock market, where in many cases they sold at a\r\nconsiderable discount. Where the state’s credit was poor, and its\r\nbanking-system insecure, the bonds could not be placed, and were\r\nrecalled after being offered. Such was the case with Iowa and\r\nWisconsin. Ohio recalled its bonds, after they had been advertised in\r\nNew York, when it was learned that the federal government assumed all\r\nwar expenses, and would refund these to the states.\r\n\r\nWisconsin adopted an ingenious plan, suggested to the State Bankers’\r\nAssociation by Alexander Mitchell. The state banks had deposited with\r\nthe state comptroller securities for their currency issues. The larger\r\nproportion of these securities was made up of the bonds of the\r\nsouthern or border states. Those of the secession states were\r\nconsidered worthless, while those of Missouri, large holdings of which\r\nwere in Wisconsin, declined rapidly. The comptroller, as required by\r\nlaw, made assessments upon the state banks, which they found it\r\ndifficult to meet. Mitchell proposed that the banks should purchase\r\nthe bonds of the state war fund at par, and that the comptroller\r\nshould accept them for the assessments. In this wise the credit of the\r\nstate was improved and the currency secured. The details of the\r\narrangement were that the banks took $800,000 of the war-fund bonds,\r\nseventy per cent of which was paid at once, three-fifths in specie and\r\ntwo-fifths in sound currency. The remaining thirty per cent was to be\r\nmet in fifteen annual installments. The adoption of this expedient\r\nfurnished the state with ready money, placed the banking currency on a\r\nsound foundation, and restored confidence to the community.\r\nWisconsin’s banks resumed specie payments at the date fixed by law,\r\nDecember 1, 1861, and maintained them for some time after the New York\r\nbanks had suspended such payments.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of these war-fund appropriations state agents flocked to\r\nNew York to arrange for the purchase of war material. Arms and\r\nammunition had to be largely secured from Europe. The New York banks\r\narranged these transactions, and furnished exchange and information.\r\nThe competition between the several state agents and those of the\r\nfederal government raised prices inordinately. This was remedied when\r\nthe federal government assumed full responsibility for all equipment.\r\n\r\n_The federal loans._ The most important function of the banks was the\r\naid they furnished the Secretary of the Treasury in floating the great\r\nfederal loans that were required by the war necessities. The special\r\nsession of Congress which met in July, 1861, appropriated $250,000,000\r\nfor the immediate needs of the government, leaving large latitude with\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury as to the method by which this amount\r\nwas to be raised.\r\n\r\nThe defeat at Bull Run put a very serious strain on the credit of the\r\nUnited States, and the forced sale of securities in a foreign market\r\nwould have been disastrous to the future conduct of the war. In the\r\ndilemma in which he was placed, Secretary Chase paid a visit to New\r\nYork, where Cisco, the assistant treasurer, invited the prominent\r\nfinancial authorities to meet him for consultation. Chase frankly\r\nstated the serious nature of the situation, and requested assistance\r\nand advice. From the standpoint of policy this was a wise measure,\r\nsince previous to this time the New York bankers had held somewhat\r\naloof from the operations of the federal treasury. Their prompt\r\nsupport at this crisis is to their perpetual credit, for although they\r\nlargely profited in the end by this government connection, at the time\r\nof the operation the transactions were of daring boldness. The banks\r\nrealized that without a firm government their own operations were\r\nimperiled, and thus they risked their all to support the government in\r\nits crisis.\r\n\r\nAt the first conference George E. Coe, president of the Exchange Bank,\r\nproposed an association to subscribe for the government loan. A\r\ncommittee appointed to develop a plan reported on August 15 for\r\nthirty-nine New York banks. Representatives from Boston and\r\nPhiladelphia were likewise present, and the loan was apportioned among\r\nthe three cities in accordance with the bank capital of each; that is,\r\nseventy per cent was to come from New York, twenty per cent from\r\nBoston, and ten per cent from Philadelphia. The association thus\r\nformed agreed to take immediately $50,000,000 of treasury bonds\r\npayable in three years with interest at seven and three-tenths per\r\ncent. This rate, representing a payment of two cents a day on each one\r\nhundred dollars loaned, had been adopted by Secretary Chase in the\r\nhope of popularizing the bonds with the people. The banks composing\r\nthe association were to pay over to the sub-treasuries of the three\r\ncities in specie ten per cent of the amount subscribed; the remainder\r\nwas to be placed to the credit of the United States upon the books of\r\nthe subscribing institutions. Meanwhile the bonds were to be offered\r\nto the people, both by the banks and the sub-treasurers, and no other\r\nUnited States securities were to be sold, except in Europe, while\r\nthese subscriptions were being solicited. The associated banks also\r\nagreed to float a similar loan of $50,000,000 in October--if it had\r\nnot by that time been taken by popular subscription--and another\r\n$50,000,000 in December.\r\n\r\nThis was the largest financial operation that had ever been attempted\r\nin the United States. Its successful accomplishment at that time was\r\nof the greatest possible value in maintaining public confidence, and\r\nin uniting the fortunes of the financiers with those of the federal\r\ngovernment. It was a tribute to the organizing ability as well as to\r\nthe patriotism of the founders of the bank association. The capital of\r\nthe united banks was but $120,000,000, and their coin assets only\r\n$63,000,000. Their subscription to $150,000,000 of government\r\nsecurities was thus an act of faith.\r\n\r\nIn practice this agreement did not work out as the bankers had hoped.\r\nChase refused to suspend the sub-treasury act, though authorized to do\r\nso by Congress, in order that the banks might pay the government’s\r\ncreditors in clearing-house certificates; thus the specie began\r\ndraining away from the banks into the sub-treasuries. The Secretary\r\nalso began the issue of demand notes on the treasury in considerable\r\namounts. Moreover, the public sales were less than had been\r\nanticipated. The bankers were accused of attempting to dictate to the\r\ngovernment concerning the conduct of the war. The inevitable result of\r\nall this friction was the suspension of specie payments by the New\r\nYork banks December 30, 1861.\r\n\r\nWith the immense strain upon the government’s resources, the\r\ncatastrophe of suspension would no doubt have occurred sooner or\r\nlater; but financial historians believe that had Secretary Chase been\r\nmore willing to accept the bankers’ propositions, had he coöperated\r\nwith them more fully, the financing of the Civil War might have\r\nwrought less damage in the business world than it did.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGENCIES\r\n\r\nDuring the sale of the $150,000,000 bond issue Secretary Chase\r\nappointed a large number of agents in every part of the United States\r\nto secure the popular subscriptions. Most of these were presidents of\r\nlocal banks. The agents were allowed a commission of one-fifth of one\r\nper cent on the first $100,000, and one-eighth on later amounts. One\r\nhundred and fifty dollars was allowed for advertising purposes. A\r\ntraveling agent went through the West, arranging for local agencies\r\nand assisting in advertising. It was proposed to allow the country\r\nbankers a larger commission with a view to stimulating wide sales, but\r\nthis proposal the Secretary of the Treasury declined to adopt.\r\n\r\nThe western agents were not very successful in promoting this loan.\r\nJay Cooke, of Philadelphia, sold more than one-fourth of all the bonds\r\nissued to the agents; but, in order to do so, spent more than the\r\namount of his commission in advertising.\r\n\r\nSecretary Chase became much interested in the measures adopted by this\r\nPhiladelphia banker. As more and more pressure was put upon him for\r\nfunds, he often consulted with Cooke, and frequently permitted the\r\nlatter to buy United States securities to buoy up a falling market. On\r\nOctober 23, 1862 Chase appointed Jay Cooke sole agent for the\r\nconversion of legal tender treasury notes into the $500,000,000 six\r\nper cent five-twenty bonds authorized by Act of Congress February 25,\r\n1862. By advertising on a larger scale than had hitherto been known,\r\nand by employment of 2,500 sub-agents, mostly bank presidents, in\r\nevery part of the North, Jay Cooke accomplished his enormous task, the\r\nloan being finally over-subscribed by $11,000,000. His commission was\r\nthree-eighths of one per cent on the first $100,000,000, of which\r\none-eighth went to the sub-agent, and one-eighth to advertising and to\r\nplacating the public press. The loan was sold in small denominations\r\nto every class of the population. Cooke patriotically resisted all\r\nproposals to sell large blocks of the bonds to European holders. He\r\nbelieved a bond issue held by the people was the safest means of\r\nfinancing and of prosecuting the war. He made the loan a great\r\ndemocratic institution. It is not too much to say that his success in\r\nselling this $500,000,000 bond issue “dispirited the South, gave\r\nEurope … useful evidence of the determined courage and material wealth\r\nof the northern people, and was a factor of vast importance in\r\ndeciding the fate of the Union.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     [2] This article was originally prepared as a memorandum for\r\n     the information of the Wisconsin State Council of Defense,\r\n     in response to the request of Charles McCarthy, secretary of\r\n     the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HARVEY REID\r\n  [From a photograph taken in 1910]]\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIARY OF HARVEY REID: KEPT AT MADISON IN THE SPRING OF 1861\r\n\r\nWITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES BY MILO M. QUAIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war time diary of Harvey Reid possesses elements of permanent\r\ninterest and value. Aside from this, however, it should have a special\r\ninterest now, when we are still passing through the initial stage of\r\nanother great war in behalf of human liberty and human rights. With\r\nthe events and emotions of the past few months still fresh in mind, it\r\nis well to relive with our eager diarist the opening scenes of the\r\nCivil War at the capital of Wisconsin. Madison is an interesting city,\r\nwith a rich and interesting history; yet it would be impossible to\r\nselect, from all its eighty years of life, a period more crowded with\r\nexciting events than were the three months of April, May, and June,\r\n1861. Fortunately a bright and eager observer was at hand making his\r\ndaily record of the thrilling life of this exciting time.\r\n\r\nHarvey Reid, the diarist, typifies the choicest product of our\r\nAmerican civilization. It was not given to him to play a prominent\r\nrôle in the drama of his time. Instead, he belonged to the great mass\r\nof Americans, of whom, as individuals, posterity will retain no\r\nmemory. But he was honest, industrious, and loyal, faithful to his\r\ncountry alike in military and in civil life. Although his education\r\nwas limited to the district school, and to the ten-weeks’ preparatory\r\ncourse at the University of Wisconsin covered by the diary, he\r\nretained a lifelong interest in educational affairs, laboring\r\neffectively for many years as school director and library trustee. His\r\nintellectual vigor is attested by the fact that after reaching his\r\nsixtieth year he began and diligently pursued the study of geology. In\r\nthe historical field two substantial volumes stand to his credit--a\r\nbiography of Enoch Long, published by the Chicago Historical Society,\r\nand one of Thomas Cox, published by the State Historical Society of\r\nIowa.\r\n\r\nReid was born in Washington County, New York, March 30, 1842, of\r\nScotch-Irish ancestry. When two years of age he was taken by his\r\nparents to Wisconsin, the journey being made by way of the Erie Canal\r\nand then around the Lakes to Racine, which was reached in June, 1844.\r\nThe elder Reid shortly removed to Yorkville, and several years later\r\nto Union Corners (now Union Grove) in Racine County. Thus Reid grew to\r\nmanhood in pioneer Wisconsin, and became in the fullest sense a\r\nproduct of the Badger State. In 1859, at the age of seventeen, he\r\nbegan teaching school in an adjoining district at a salary of twenty\r\ndollars a month. A second winter was passed in the same way (the\r\nsummers being devoted to helping his father), and then, in the spring\r\nof 1861, came the prized opportunity of ten weeks’ schooling at the\r\nstate university. How fully the young man improved it the pages of the\r\ndiary reveal.\r\n\r\nOf the three room-mates in old North Hall from Union Grove, in the\r\nspring of 1861, Goldsworthy, Fuller, and Reid, only the first-named\r\nresumed his studies in the autumn. Reid again taught a winter term of\r\ndistrict school in Racine County, and then followed his parents, who\r\nhad removed to the new town of Shannon, Illinois. But in the summer of\r\n1862, in response to Lincoln’s call for “six hundred thousand more,”\r\nhe returned to Union Grove to enlist with a squad of boys from the old\r\nhome neighborhood. Characteristic of the conduct of the Civil War is\r\nthe fact that of the twenty-four boys of the “Union Grove Squad,” four\r\ndied of disease, while but one was killed in battle. Reid enlisted at\r\nRacine, August 7, 1862, in the Twenty-second Wisconsin Infantry. The\r\nclose of the war terminated his service in June, 1865. During the war\r\nhis father had removed to Sabula, Iowa. Following him thither, on\r\nbeing released from the army, Reid made his home in Jackson County,\r\nIowa, until his death in 1910. He played a worthy, albeit quiet, rôle\r\nin life, and died sincerely mourned by the circle of his\r\nacquaintances.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War papers of Mr. Reid were presented to the State\r\nHistorical Society of Wisconsin a year ago by his daughter, Mary A.\r\nReid of Des Moines. They comprise, in addition to the diary here\r\nprinted, a voluminous correspondence during the term of military\r\nservice, with parents and sisters at home. At the beginning of his\r\nservice Mr. Reid formed the design of writing his home letters in the\r\nform of a journal, instead of keeping, as so many Civil War soldiers\r\ndid, a formal diary. Because of this fact, and of the high order of\r\nintelligence and ability possessed by the writer, the letters\r\nconstitute a valuable record, well worthy of publication when the\r\noccasion shall offer.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY DIARY\r\n\r\nMAR. 22D.

Had considerable trouble in getting\r\nacross a large crack in the ice in the middle of the lake. On arriving\r\non the shore found that the Asylum folks were making sugar. An\r\nIrishman whom we found there took us immediately to the engine rooms,\r\nand showed us the gas works,--(retort & meter), the engines, a large\r\nwheel with fans for driving air into the principal buildings, the\r\nlarge force pump worked by steam, the laundry rooms, took us through\r\nthe underground passage which leads between the two buildings. Found\r\nUncle T. in the billiard rooms where a crazy half breed & two others\r\nwere playing. Uncle T. looks quite healthy & appears somewhat better\r\nin mind than when he left home. He took [us] all over the\r\nbuilding--let [?] into the ward in which he is--there we saw about a\r\ndozen insane some sitting, some walking back & forth the length of the\r\nhall, one lying down full length upon the floor, & 2 curled up in the\r\nwindow; one was a man named Jones, who came from Racine Co. and had\r\noften been at U. G. He had sometime been injured by a thrashing\r\nmachine & showed us a scar where one of his ribs had been taken out.\r\nOne was a preacher’s son, named Hall, he would speak to no one. One\r\nhad a violin which he commenced playing shortly after we came in, and\r\nkept it up all the while we were there.\r\n\r\nUncle T. showed us in this ward, the water closet, where opening the\r\ndoor caused water to run through the seats: the bathing room, the\r\nreading room where they keep the daily & other papers for patients to\r\nread. We were invited to take dinner with the help. Mr. Griswold the\r\nkeeper, told me that Uncle T. has improved much; when he came there he\r\nwas a great bore. After dinner we went into the cooking room where\r\nmost things are cooked by steam.\r\n\r\nWe went out and visited the Indian mounds between the Asylum & the\r\nbeach. several are in the shape of men, and one is a very accurate\r\nrepresentation of a rabbit. We went around the lake going home and had\r\na pretty hard time of it.\r\n\r\nMONDAY, APRIL 1, 1861. Yesterday all 3 of us attended the Cong. Heard\r\nProf. Butler[15] preach from John XVIII. 38. Joined Prof.\r\nConover’s[16] Bible class in this church. In the eve. went with about\r\n20 of the other students to hear Mr. Mason of the Universalist. His\r\ntheme was the “mercy of the Lord,” and his discourse was strongly\r\nUniversalist.\r\n\r\nTo-day, after the regular routine of school duties, John & I went down\r\ntown about 5 o’clock so as to be at the depot when the cars arrived, &\r\nsee if C. White came he did not arrive however, & we got home at 9\r\nsomewhat disappointed and very tired John & I hired a P. O. box\r\nbetween us No. 693.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY 2. Went to the depot in the evening to meet Mr. Bradford if he\r\ncame, but were disappointed. Received two letters from the Grove--one\r\nfrom C. & Billy White[17] & one from Libbie. It is the first I have\r\nheard from the Grove since I have been here. Will also recd a letter.\r\n\r\nNo news of importance. It has been quite warm & thawing all day.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY 3. The sun rose clear and warm after a frosty night, & as we\r\nwere sitting by our open window, we were startled by loud & frequent\r\nreports, which resembled the discharge of cannon, but Will says it is\r\nthe ice cracking on the lake.\r\n\r\nWent to the depot again to meet Bradford, but were again disappointed.\r\nMade arrangements to have bread baked by a woman near the Univ.\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 4, 1861. The forenoon passed without incident worthy\r\nof remark, except that when I rose in the morning I had a very sore\r\nthroat which I am afraid will trouble me.\r\n\r\nIn the evening John & I again started for the depot to meet Bradford,\r\nbut the cars having arrived before we could get there, we went to the\r\nCapitol to wait for him. He brought John’s things and also some summer\r\nclothes & a letter for me from Sarah. I sent several of the Univ.\r\ncatalogues to our Eastern friends\r\n\r\nFRIDAY 5. By advice of Mr. Bradford I slept last night with a wet\r\ntowel bound round my throat & this morning it is much better. Went\r\ndown town after school, to the depot after the things which Mr. B.\r\nbro’t & then to Mr. White’s with John to get some of his things. Did\r\nnot get back in time to be initiated into the Society tonight--attended\r\nboth--the Hesperian the most of the evening--The Hesp’s discussed,\r\n“Res. that a man should resist a law which his conscience tells him is\r\nmorally law [wrong].” decided in aff. The Ath’s. discussed “Res. That\r\nthe character of Queen Elizabeth was worthy of emulation.” I dont know\r\nhow it was decided.\r\n\r\nRained _nearly_ all _day_ & _all_ of the evening\r\n\r\nSATURDAY 6. Commenced with a rain storm, continued with a rain storm,\r\nand ended with a rain storm, i. e. it rained all day incessantly,\r\nwhich kept us in the house all of the time until about 4 o’clock when\r\nJohn & I went down town to make some purchases & there learned that 19\r\nWis. banks had been “thrown out” & every bill I had ($8) was on\r\nthem.[18] Wrote a long letter home,--or rather, wrote one & commenced\r\nanother--\r\n\r\nDiscredited money is worth 80 cts.\r\n\r\nMONDAY, APRIL 8, 1861. Yesterday was a pleasant day again--Went with a\r\nlarge company of students to hear Prof. Butler preach, it being the\r\nlast time he is going to preach for the present. His text was 1 Cor.\r\nXI, 22, and a capital discourse. Mr. Bradford was with us in Prof.\r\nConover’s Bible Class. To-day is another rainy day The morning duties\r\npassed as usual, at 3 o’clock, we were invited by some of the boys to\r\ngo to the City Hall & hear Geo. B. Smith[19] speak on a lawsuit\r\nbetween Bird & Morrison The suit involves $180,000. Mr. Morrison\r\ncommitted suicide last winter, it is said because he had perjured\r\nhimself in the suit. He was the def’t. Mr. Smith made a very able\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY 9. The day passed as usual, i. e. a continual rain storm.\r\nAbout 5 o’clock, went down town, and learned by hand bills that Moses\r\nM. Strong would review a speech of Jno. Y. Smith,[20] in the Assembly\r\nChamber to-night. Went to hear him--His speech was on the secession\r\nquestion, arguing against war and a very sound effort.\r\n\r\nA meeting was called after the speech & a resolution introduced\r\nfavoring Pres. Lincoln & the war policy, which, after some talk pro &\r\ncon, was laid on the table[21]\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY 10. A pleasant day at last & the first one really I have\r\nseen since I have been in Madison. Was out with many others of the\r\nstudents playing on the green after school. Rec’d a letter from Couse\r\n& the Adv. from home.\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 11, 1861. Went to the P. O. about 5 O’Clock and\r\nreceived a letter from Libbie. The “discredited Wis. money” is down to\r\n75 cents in many of the stores.\r\n\r\nRec’d a letter from Libbie\r\n\r\nFRIDAY 12. is the day for the Prep. Rhetorical Exercises but our\r\ndivision does not come on this time. The declamations & compositions\r\nwere very good. At 4 o’clock went down town. In the Assembly they were\r\ntalking on the Normal School Fund bill--which was passed. Several\r\nbills were ordered to third reading. Went into the City Hall tower &\r\nsaw the clock, which struck while we were there. The view of the city\r\nfrom this tower is the finest I have yet seen.\r\n\r\nIn the Hesp. Soc. the question, “Res. that the U. S. ought to coërce\r\nthe seceding states,” was decided in the neg. Hostilities in the South\r\ncomc’d at 4 this morning.\r\n\r\nSATURDAY 13. Visited this P. M. the Mendota Foundry, but there was\r\nnothing interesting going on. Went to the Capitol & found the Assembly\r\ntaking an informal recess waiting for absentees. Mr. Bradford said he\r\ncould go to the University now. We first went into the State\r\nTreasurer’s room saw Mr. Hastings--went also into the Secretary of\r\nState’s office, & into the State Journal office where they were\r\nprinting by steam machinery.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradford visited our rooms & also saw Mr. Muir’s clocks & other\r\ncuriosities.\r\n\r\nMONDAY, APRIL 15, 1861. Went to hear Mr. Taylor[22] the new Cong.\r\nminister, yesterday. He is a good preacher but preached a doctrinal\r\nsermon from Heb. II. 12. Learned in Prof. C’s Bible class that Spirit\r\nin the original means wind. Wrote a letter home for Mr. Bradford to\r\ncarry.\r\n\r\nIn the Geometry recitation to-day the door of the recitation room\r\nopened and an old man entered whom I immediately recognized as Uncle\r\nThompson. He said they had brought him over from the asylum to go home\r\nwith Mr. B. but the Legislature had been reconvened by the Governor on\r\nacct. of the war news & Mr. B. could not go & he wished to go to\r\nClinton to see Mr. Tinker, before he went home & would like to go\r\nright along I obtained permission to leave the class & accompanied him\r\ndown town--sold my $5 bill for .65 cts. (but afterwards saw Mr. B. &\r\nbowd $3). carried his trunk to the depot and saw him safely off. Went\r\nwith John into the country & got his straw bed filled & helped him\r\ncarry it home, as we expected Charlie W. to-night. Went to the depot\r\nat 10½ P. M. but he did not come.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY 16TH. Charlie came on the 3:45 train to-day. He brot packages\r\nfrom home for each of us--my linen coat & shaving tools & a letter. We\r\ntook him into the Hist. Soc., then into the Assembly, & saw Mr.\r\nBradford, who came to the University & took supper with us The\r\nLegislature held a session this evening which we all attended. A\r\nBanking law was passed a part of the debate on which we heard in the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY 17. Charlie heard the Algebra & Geometry classes & we also\r\nwent to Prof. Carr’s[23] room & heard part of his lecture on Coral. At\r\nnoon John & I were excused from further recitations & went with C.\r\ndown town. the Legislature had adjourned & gone home. We found that\r\nbooks had been opened in the Gov. Guards Armory in the City Hall for\r\nreceiving enlistments for the Southern army & that about ½ a dozen of\r\nthe Univ. boys had enlisted.\r\n\r\nThe city is in a great military excitement\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 18, 1861. Found that there were seven of the boys\r\nenlisted yesterday--Curtis, Frost, Wyse, High, Norcross, A. G. Miller\r\n& Reed & Bull[24]--but High was not accepted being under 17.\r\n\r\nA meeting of citizens being called for tonight to provide for the\r\nmaintenance of the families of those enlisting, we attended it at the\r\nAssembly Chamber, the chamber was crowded as full as they could stand,\r\n& the most enthusiastic meeting I ever attended. They commenced the\r\nmeeting with singing the Star Spangled Banner, & then received\r\nsubscriptions. Men would get up & offer various sums as they were\r\nable--$500, 400, 200, 100 50 25 & 10 $7,490 were subscribed\r\naltogether. The citizens then escorted the Gov. Guards to their\r\nArmory, under the marshalship of Gen. Atwood.[25]\r\n\r\nFRIDAY 19. In the Prep. Rhetorical Exercises this P. M. I read a\r\ncomposition--“America & Italy”--John--“The Discovery of the\r\nMississippi”--& Will a declamation--“The true vigor in government.” In\r\nthe Hesperian Soc. tonight the question was, “Res. that expatriation\r\nis a natural right.” decided in the aff. While the Debate was going\r\non, Curtis, Bull & Wyse, of the University Volunteers entered the room\r\n& were greeted with tremendous applause--After the Soc. had adjourned\r\nit was organized into a meeting, to express the feelings of the\r\nmembers on the war question,--Norcross having just entered was loudly\r\ncalled for & rec’d with uproarious cheering. The other volunteers,\r\nBull, Curtis & Wyse also expressed their feelings in regard to the\r\ncause in which they had engaged, after which the principal members of\r\nthe Society were called upon--Clawson, Allen, Ball, H. Vilas, M.\r\nLeahy, Parkinson Jr.,[26] two from town--Brush & Lockwood,\r\nWallace,[27] and another volunteer belonging to the Atheneans--E. G.\r\nMiller--spoke, & the enthusiasm was roused to the highest pitch. Then\r\nwent into the Athenean where the same kind of exercises were being\r\nheld, & heard Bull, Leahy, Ball, Church & Silverthorne[28] speak after\r\nwhich the meeting adjourned at 12½ o’clock with three rousing cheers\r\nfor the University Volunteers.\r\n\r\nSAT. 20TH. The boys held a meeting at 4 P. M. for the purpose of\r\norganizing a military company here, but as we went fishing, we could\r\nnot attend. Curtis has left the Gov.

Mr. B. is one\r\nof the volunteers in the war, & as he is going with his company this\r\nwas his farewell sermon--His text was--St. Luke 22:36. & his subject\r\nour duty towards our government. He is a mere boy and his sermon was\r\nnot remarkably sound. He wore his military dress in the pulpit Attack\r\non Ft. Pickens--news came 21st.\r\n\r\n22d. Meeting of Univ. Guards this P. M. at 4 o’clock, when we U. G.\r\nboys joined it. They are about giving it up however, as it is not\r\nlikely that they can get drill master from town. Drilled a while on\r\nthe grounds by Campbell, a volunteer & Marsh,[29] a student.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY 23. The Univ. Guards again met this P. M. & the committee\r\nappointed at the first meeting, having reported yesterday that they\r\nhad been unable to procure the services of a drill-master or arms, but\r\nthat there was a company of young men organizing down town in which\r\nthe students would have the first chance in joining &c.; they were\r\ninstructed at yesterdays meeting to ascertain the terms of enlisting\r\n&c. & report today. They reported that the Co. would be organized\r\nthere, and the boys could join without expense. & the boys having\r\nnearly all previously joined it, the Univ. Guards were disbanded. The\r\nVolunteers will start tomorrow & it was voted that we go to the depot\r\nin a body and see them off.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY 24. On going to the Geometry recitation at 11 O’Clock, John\r\n& I found that we were the only ones there the rest of the boys having\r\ngone down town to see the soldiers off. We also got excused then. &\r\nwent to the Capitol Park, where we found the Artillery Co. with their\r\nguns, & both the Fire Co’s preparing to accompany the soldiers to the\r\ndepot. At ½ past 12 the procession started. The Madison Guards were\r\naccompanied by the German Turner Society, the Gov’s Guards by a\r\nprocession of citizens & the sidewalks were crowded with a dense\r\nthrong the whole length of the procession. Arriving at the depot the\r\nsoldiers were addressed by Judge Vilas,[30] & Gov. Randall[31] & the\r\nStar Spangled Banner was sung by Miss Susan Denin,[32] actress. Three\r\ncars were standing on the track which the soldiers filled about 10\r\nminutes before the time of starting & then bid goodby to their\r\nfriends, Norcross & Bull of the Univ. boys stood it well, but Miller,\r\nWyse & Smith were much affected. The boys drilled down town this\r\nevening, but as we could not get our supper on time to go with them,\r\nwe did not get there till they had got through.\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 25, 1861. All Wis. bills are refused today. I do not\r\nknow yet how many will actually be thrown out It is said that a\r\nmeeting of bankers will be held tomorrow to determine on their future\r\ncourse.

They were both partially uniformed & armed, &\r\nseemed pretty well drilled. They marched to camp, selected their\r\nquarters, then marched to the general mess room & partook of a warm\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nPurchased a copy of the Wkly Journal & sent [it] home.\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, MAY 2, 1861. The Beloit Guards arrived today They are\r\nwithout uniform or arms but a very fine looking company. Followed them\r\nto the camp but there was nothing going on there.\r\n\r\nBefore they came, Will & I went to the depot, expecting them but as\r\nthey would not come for some time we walked on south from the depot &\r\nvisited the ridge between Lakes Monona & Wingra This is a very high\r\nridge & the top is covered with Indian mounds of all kinds & sizes.\r\nThe Roman Catholic Cemet[e]ry is on the side hill, & we also visited\r\nit. Saw an Indian canoe in a dooryard on the way. Was told it belongs\r\nto Dr. Hunt.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY 3. On awakening this morning found that it was raining smartly,\r\n& it continued to do so until about noon when it turned into snow &\r\ndid not clear off until nearly evening. In the Rhet.

We all visited the camp this A. M. Saw the Belle City\r\nRifles & was very much surprised at seeing _Geo. Lincoln_[36] in the\r\nranks. He is the only acquaintance with them. Fat Sheldon,[37] whom I\r\nhave often seen before, was with them however.\r\n\r\nThe Oshkosh Guards and the Citizens Guards of Fox Lake having arrived\r\nthis P. M. went to the camp to see them. Staid till 8 O’Clock & had\r\nconsiderable difficulty in passing the guard.\r\n\r\nSUNDAY, MAY 5, 1861. Attended church at the Methodists to day. Did not\r\nhear the name of the preacher. Text--Romans 14:7. Rained during the\r\nwhole of the service & we had a fine run through the rain to the Cong.\r\nChurch to attend Bible class. Visited the camp in the P. M. George had\r\nbeen on guard most of the day. Were kept there by the rain until\r\nnearly dark. & thereby were again made prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nMAY 6TH. Went down to camp again this P. M. Nothing of consequence\r\noccurred only that we were stopped by the guard again and had to be\r\npassed out by the corporal. They are very strict after 6 o’clock.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY 7. John and I went down town after school, & Will went to Camp\r\nRandall. When we came back we went down there too, but were refused\r\nadmittance as they had made a rule that no one should be allowed in\r\nafter 6 o’clock. While we were standing there, Will & George came to\r\nthe gate and we shook hands with G. over the soldier’s bayonet.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY 8. The Trigonometry Class in which Will is, procured the\r\ninstruments to day and were practicing surveying.\r\n\r\nAt 3 o’clock I went out with them and saw them take angles for\r\nmeasuring the height of University Hall. It proved to be 115.838 feet,\r\nif their work is correct.\r\n\r\nVisited the camp again, Mr. Durand was there, and after the soldiers\r\nsupper the Bible [Belle] City Rifles were marched to the Fine Arts\r\nHall hill and drawn up in a line to hear a speech from him. He\r\nendeavored to persuade them all to remain with the Co. as an order has\r\nbeen recd that they must now enlist for 3 years or during the war,\r\nwhich many refuse to do.\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, MAY 9, 1861. Will & I procured a boat after school and went\r\nout on the lake to try & get some fish. After being out two hours we\r\nspeared one little _bull head_ which we gave to the owner of the boat\r\nand agreed to go out with him to night and furnish light for him to\r\nfish. Started at 8, was out till 10 & caught two fish both of which we\r\ngave the boat owner.\r\n\r\nReceived a letter announcing the death of P. P. Taber.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY 10. Our fishing excursion caused us to oversleep ourselves, and\r\nwhen there was a loud rapping at our door about 15 minutes before 6,\r\nit did not wake me enough to comprehend what it was: but in about ½ an\r\nhour afterwards Mr. Wildish[38] again came to our room and brot a box\r\nwhich he said a gentleman had left for me. I saw by the name on the\r\nbox it was Seth Rice who had brot it from home. Thus by my sleepiness\r\nI missed seeing an acquaintance from U. G. John & I took a walk in the\r\nN. E. part of the town, past Gov. Farwell’s Octagon house, & visited\r\nthe Cemetery. Attended Society’s meetings.\r\n\r\nSATURDAY 11. Nothing particular going on until evening when the\r\nHesperian celebrated the anniversary of the Dedication of their new\r\nHall.

This is Library day. Took out Vols. 1st & 2nd of\r\nSmithsonian Cont. to Knowledge, treating of Indian Mounds & other\r\nAmerican Antiquities.

Went to the Capitol at 3 O’Clk Assembly was in session,\r\nbut almost immediately adjourned. Mr. Bradford has not arrived yet. As\r\nWill & I were Coming home again we were hailed from the opposite side\r\nof the street and looking up saw H. Foster, T. Graham & Alex.\r\nAdams[43] who have joined the B. C. Rifles in place of those who\r\nrefused to enlist for three years. they told us that W. White was also\r\nwith them & had [been] to the Univ. with G. L. to look for us.

Went to camp after school,\r\nand found that I Martyne & H. Ginty[44] were with the new recruits. 2\r\nZouaves were on the grounds (one, dressed in full uniform) who\r\nentertained the regiment with specimens of their drill. Went down town\r\nabout 5. & met Mr. Bradford there.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY 17. In the Rhetorical Exercises I read a composition--“Political\r\nParties”--Will a composition--“A Great Discovery” John obtained an\r\nexcuse, as he expected his mother on the cars.

F.,\r\nfrom camp Sen Cox Ch’n. of Com. Bill providing for Volunteer’s\r\nfamilies & the 6 Rgt bill were up. Heard Gill, Hazelton, Joiner,\r\nQuentin,[47] & another one speak\r\n\r\nMONDAY, MAY 20, 1861. Yesterday commenced with a heavy [rain] which\r\ncontinued till about 9 O’Clock when Billy White & Wm. Sheldon of\r\nBurlington came from Camp Randall. On account of the very wet weather\r\nand also because our visitors did not wish to go I did not go to\r\nchurch in the A. M. & as it rained all P. M. I could not go then. The\r\nboys staid till nearly evening. John was at Mr. White’s nearly all day\r\nwith his mother. Wrote a letter home last night & sent it with Mrs.\r\nGoldsworthy today. Visited the Capitol in the P. M. but Legislature\r\nhad adjourned\r\n\r\nTUESDAY 21. Visited the Assembly Chamber this P. M. Assembly were in\r\nsession, discussing the Military Bill; more especially the provision\r\nfor paying the soldiers, and requiring the war loan to be taken, in\r\ncoin. Heard Judge Spooner, Messrs. Bradford, Warner Atwood, &\r\nRamsey[48] speak.\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment went to the camp, & returning to the Univ. took\r\na bathe in the lake.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY 22. The Sophs & Freshs got a rich joke on the Seniors this\r\nmorning. They had bills printed last night composed in Artemus Ward\r\nstyle, purporting to be an advertisement for their lost cushions, and\r\nthis morning they posted [them] in the most conspicuous places around\r\nthe University & down town. Went to the Capitol immediately after\r\nschool. The Assembly were engaged in a very animated discussion on a\r\nproposition that the enlistments should be divided proportionally\r\namong the Cong. dists. It was lost. I went with Mr. B. to Camp &\r\nwitnessed the dress parade of the Regt. John & I subscribed for the\r\nState Journal for 3 mos.\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, MAY 23, 1861. The Assembly this P. M. were discussing a\r\nbanking law, but it not being interesting I did not stay long. Went to\r\nthe Post Office & from there to the Journal to read the news. They\r\nkeep there a file of all the City dailies free to the public.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY 24. Mr. Bradford visited us in our rooms at noon today. He said\r\nthe Milwaukee Zouaves, having arrived at 7 O’Clock this morning would\r\ndrill at 2½. and the Legislature had adjourned to witness it. He\r\nattended our Latin recitation & then we all went down to camp with\r\nhim. The Zouave maneuvers proved very interesting & we staid till the\r\ntroops went to supper at 5½ O’Clock, then went to the P. O. George was\r\non guard at the gate. Judge Larrabee,[49] being on the grounds was\r\npointed out to us by Mr. B.\r\n\r\nSATURDAY 25. Went to the Capitol at 11 O’Clock. The Senate had under\r\nconsideration the war loan bill, which originated in the Ass. 15\r\namendments adopted by Sen. 3 of them non-concurred by Assem. 2 receded\r\nfrom by Sen. & the 3d. was that the loan should be taken & soldiers\r\npaid in coin. Sen. Gill moved that the Senate _adhere_ to this\r\namendment. A. I. Bennett said this was unusual & would be very\r\ndiscourteous to the Assem. as no Com. of Conference could be appointed\r\nif it were adopted. Sen. Hutchinson moved to amend that they _insist_\r\ninstead of _adhere_. After warm discussion by Gill, Maxon, & Joiner, &\r\nVirgin, Hutchinson, A. I. Bennett & Hazelton it was carried that they\r\nadhere. On coming up in the Assem. this action of the Sen. was\r\ndenounced by Frisby, Webb, Atwood, Spooner, D. H. Johnson & Hicks[50]\r\n& the Assem. _insisted_ on their non-concurrence & asked a Com. of\r\nConference, which was granted by the Senate & they proposed a bill\r\nwhich passed.\r\n\r\nMONDAY, MAY 27, 1861. Attended the Cong. Church yesterday. Mr.\r\nTaylor’s Text was John III. 7 & I. 13., Also attended Prof. C’s Bible\r\nClass, Mr. Bradford was also there. In the P. M. the wind blew from\r\nthe South a perfect gale. Wrote home & sent the letter with Mr.\r\nBradford.\r\n\r\nTo-day went to the depot at noon to see Mr. Bradford off. After school\r\nwent to the camp. The exercises on evening parade are changed today.\r\nSaw the maneuvers gone through with by Capts. Strong’s & Randolph’s\r\nCos.[51] united but could not wait until the regular parade\r\n\r\nTUESDAY 28. Nothing worthy of note transpired to-day.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY 29. Seth Rice visited us today on his return from Richland\r\nCo. where he has been about three weeks. The train on which he came\r\ndoes not stop at the station (Stoughton) where he wishes to stop & he\r\ntherefore lays over at Madison till the 4 o’clock train tomorrow\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nHe arrived about 4 o’clock & soon I went to the camp with him & we\r\nstaid till after the evening parade. The exercise at this time now\r\nis--the companies form in line with their arms, come to parade rest.\r\nThe band plays a tune & marches in front of the regiment the whole\r\nlength of the line & back again--the gun is fired and the flag comes\r\ndown--The Adj. announces to the Col. “the Parade is formed” The Col\r\nput them through the Manual. The Sergeants report they are dismissed.\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, MAY 30, 1861. Got up before 4 o’clock this morning to see\r\nMr. Rice off. As we were sitting in our room at noon, the door opened\r\nand Charlie White entered without any previous announcement even the\r\nceremony of knocking. After attending our Latin recitation we went\r\nwith him to the camp. He had not previously heard that Billie was\r\nhere. We staid till after parade & then John & I went down town\r\npurchased some meat, & when we got home borrowed a cooker & had a warm\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY 31. As we could not prevail on Charlie to stay here until\r\nMonday we obtained excuse from recitations today, hired a boat and\r\nwent over to the Asylum with him. Visited all the places we had seen\r\nwhen there before and also were shown into the lower ward, and women’s\r\nward. The wind having risen & blowing from the S. W.--almost directly\r\nahead--we concluded it would be impossible to row 4 back in the small\r\nboat which we had, so John & Charlie went round the lake afoot and\r\nWill & I rowed across. We went first to Sugar Bush point, where\r\nsheltered by the point, from the wind we tried to catch some fish but\r\ndid not succeed. After starting for home the wind blew so hard that we\r\ncould not make an inch headway but a rain coming up the wind ceased.\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, JUNE 1. Charlie went home at 10 o’clock last night, via\r\nMilwaukee.\r\n\r\nJohn & I took our hooks & went on the R. R. bridge to fish but could\r\ncatch nothing. But Will & I went out with a Dutchman in the evening\r\nand speared 7 in all--1 pickerel, 1 sucker, 2 bass & 3 bull heads. We\r\ntook the sucker and pickerel & had them for dinner the next day.\r\n\r\nSUNDAY, JUNE 2d Attended the Presbyterian Church today & Prof C’s\r\nBible Class. Mr. Green had one of the most interesting sermons I ever\r\nlistened to. He had four texts--Lev. X. 1. 2 & 3. The other three I\r\nhave forgotten. Wrote a letter home in the P. M.\r\n\r\nMONDAY, JUNE 3, 1861. Going down town at noon today we learned by the\r\ndispatch on the Patriot bulletin board & by the crape hung around some\r\nof the stores, the sad intelligence of the death of Judge Douglas.[52]\r\nAll of the flags in the city are at half mast and cannon are being\r\nfired every half hour till sundown at the Capitol & at Camp Randall. A\r\nmeeting of the citizens was called for tonight, which we attended.\r\nGov. Randall was appointed Ch’n & made a very affecting & pertinent\r\nspeech. A committee was appointed to draft resolutions & speeches were\r\nmade by E. A. Calkins, G. B. Smith, L. P. Harvey, M. H.\r\nOrton,--Gregory, & Col. Fairchild, & Chauncey Abbott.[53]\r\n\r\nTUESDAY 4. Went to the camp after school, to witness the parade. The\r\nboys say that a telegram was rec’d by Gov. Randall today from the\r\nSec’y of War ordering the 2d & 3d Regt’s. to Wash. as soon as they can\r\nbe got ready, and they will probably go Monday. They have commenced\r\nhaving battalion drills today but, as they occur at three o’clock we\r\ncan never see them. The flags are still flying at half mast and the\r\ncom officers all wear crape on their left arms for 10 days.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY 5. An accident occurred on the R. R. last night. An axle of\r\na freight car broke in crossing the bridge over the lake, threw the\r\ntrain off the track, and tore up the track and ties for some distance.\r\nIt was a very dangerous accident as it occurred on the open bridge\r\nover quite deep water; but, fortunately, no one was injured. We\r\nfinished the review of Geometry today, and now take propositions\r\npromi[s]cuously anywhere in the book so as to be more thoroughly\r\nprepared for examination. We also commence today to review Latin. Went\r\nto the P. O. after school.\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, JUNE 6, 1861. Visited the camp this evening during parade.\r\nHeard that they nearly had a mutiny last night. The sentry at the gun\r\nchallenged the “grand rounds” when the officer not giving the\r\ncountersign right he pricked him with his bayonet when his gun was\r\nsnatched away from him and he “pitched in” to the officer with his\r\nfists for which he was put into the guard house, which the Capt. of\r\nhis comp’y (La Crosse) having heard, he ordered him to be taken out;\r\nthat not being done he ordered his company to charge bayonets & the\r\nwhole reg’t being roused they broke into the g. house & released the\r\nman & also all other prisoners who were there.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY 7. There were no Rhetorical Exercises today, as in the two\r\nweeks before examination students are supposed to be preparing for\r\nthat event and cannot perform this extra duty. “Got stuck” on a sum in\r\nAlgebra today, but mean to stick to it till I get it out.\r\n\r\nWent down to the P. O. after school\r\n\r\nSATURDAY 8. The ladies of Madison gave the soldiers a picnic today.\r\nThe tables in the “Operative Machinery” room were spread with bread,\r\nbutter pies, cakes & sweatmeats, to which the boys did ample justice\r\nafter which came speeches, music by the brass band, singing of Star\r\nSp. Banner, and dispersion. The parade was formed almost immediately\r\nafter the supper and all present witnessed it. Rec’d letter from home\r\nenclosing a “Programme of Commencement of Ind. Univ.” from Willie\r\nReid.\r\n\r\nSUNDAY, 9TH--Rev. Mr. Britton (Epis.) held a service on the camp at 9½\r\nA. M. He preached a patriotic sermon from the 12th chap of Kings.\r\nAttended Bible Class & Mason’s in evening.\r\n\r\nMONDAY, JUNE 10, 1861. Went to camp in the evening & there learned\r\nthat Mrs. Graham & Mrs. St. George had been there today to see their\r\nsons; also while we were there Cap. Strong told his men that 50 of\r\nthem could go home that night to see their friends before starting for\r\n“the wars.” T. G., T. St G.,[54] and W. White were among the no. who\r\nobtained permission to go. Geo. L. got out of the camp, & Will & I\r\nwent with [him] to Father Norris’ to get the women to go home with\r\ntheir boys, but when we arrived at the depot we learned that an order\r\nhad come from the Adj’t Gen. forbidding their going at this time.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY 11. Obtained excuse from Geom. recitation and went to the camp\r\nto see if the boys are going today. They cannot go as they are being\r\nmustered in to the U. S. service. Mrs. G. & St G. were there when we\r\narrived at the camp & went home at 1 O’Clock. Staid at the camp till 5\r\no’clock to see the ceremony of mustering in the troops by Capt.\r\nMcIntyre of the U. S. Infantry. 7 companies took the oath today.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY 12. We were all excused from Latin recitation, and visited\r\nMadison High School. The teacher, Miss Cowes,[55] seemed unprepared\r\nfor visitors, and the afternoon session being a short one we heard but\r\ntwo recitations, (reading & Philos[o]phy) of which the Philosophy (not\r\nbeing a regular recitation at that hour) was rather poorly recited.\r\nThere were but three boys in the room, the school consisting\r\nprincipally of girls.\r\n\r\nReceived a letter from Libbie\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, JUNE 13, 1861. Visited the camp in the P. M. Two squads (14\r\n& 18) have gone home from the B. C. Co. but the U. G. boys were in\r\nneither of them. The parade tonight was drill & uninteresting, so many\r\nof them having gone home.\r\n\r\nFinished review of Geometry today and take original propositions for\r\nremainder of the recitations.\r\n\r\nGot the key from Dr. Carr & visited the Mineralogical, Geological &\r\nNatural History Cabinet, with Will & Holt.\r\n\r\nWas much interested in some of the curiosities to be seen there.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY 14. By invitation of the boys we took supper at the camp this\r\nevening and were well pleased with the fare. There is some prospect of\r\nthe boys going home to-morrow. The regiment will probably start for\r\nthe east Tuesday.\r\n\r\nFinished the review of Latin today, and now the class is going to try\r\nand get through Liber Tertius by Tuesday.\r\n\r\nAttended the Society’s meetings. The Hesperian discussed the property\r\nqualification question, and the Ath’s “That the legal profession\r\npresents greater inducement than the others” The A’s elected officers\r\nfor the ensuing term--Griswold, Presd. Silverthorne, V. P.\r\nFallows,[56] Secy. Holt, Censor.\r\n\r\nSATURDAY 15. On visiting the camp at 9 O’Clk found that another squad\r\nhad been made up to go home, and Geo. L. & T. St G. were among them.\r\nWent back to our rooms and wrote letters to send by them.\r\n\r\nAt 4 O’Clk, Billy W. came to our rooms & said that he, T. Graham &\r\nAlec. Adams had also got furloughs and were going home on the 10 o’clk\r\ntrain, expecting to hire livery from Milwaukee. Went with Billy down\r\ntown where he got his picture taken and the boys ate supper with us.\r\n\r\nSUNDAY 16TH.--Heard Mr. Green preach & attended Bible Class--Prof. C.\r\nwas not there & Mr Dudley took charge, which made it very dull.\r\n\r\nMONDAY, JUNE 17, 1861. Went to G. B. Smith’s law office to see if he\r\nwould deliver the address at U. G. on the 4th. He was not in; but his\r\nstudent (Mr. Bird) told me tha[t] his engagements would prevent his\r\naccepting the invitation. Then wrote a letter to “Pump Carpenter”[57]\r\nfor the same purpose, as he is now living on his farm 6 miles from the\r\ncity. Attended the panorama of Dr. Kane’s Arctic Expedition & was much\r\npleased with it.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY 18. After school Will and I went with Frost across Lake Monona\r\nto his home, where we were treated to a warm supper, strawberry\r\nshortcake and strawberries & cream.\r\n\r\nThere is an encampment of Indians near by which we visited. There were\r\ntwo wigwams, in which or near by were 5 men, 4 squaws, & 7 children.\r\n\r\nWe also saw a young man & 2 boys in a canoe when coming down. There\r\nwere two canoes in the river close by and Frost & Will got into one\r\nwhich came very [near] upsetting as it requires much practice to get\r\nused to them.\r\n\r\nPicked up some clams in the lake & cooked them when we got home. The\r\nsoup was very good but the clams were tough.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY 19. Examination commences today. At 9 O’clock & until 11,\r\nthe Senior Class was examined by Prof. Read on International &\r\nConstitutional Law. This was by means of lectures by members of the\r\nclass on different subjects connected with this study and proved very\r\ninteresting From 11 to 12 Prof. Sterling’s class in Analytical\r\nGeometry was examined. This was “all Greek” to me, but the students\r\nseemed to understand the subject well especially as it was one of last\r\nterm’s studies. Between 3 & 4 o’clock attended Prof. Butler’s class in\r\nHomer’s Iliad. McMynn[58] was present at this examination. From there\r\nwe went into Prof. Read’s room where the Seniors were examined on\r\nPolitical Economy. Rec’d a letter from home.\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, JUNE 20, 1861. Went down to camp at 8 o’clock to see the\r\nboys off. The Belle City Co. (Co. F.) was in the “Operative Machinery”\r\nroom, having just got there haversacks filled with provision. The\r\nregiment soon after formed on parade & were ordered by the Col. to\r\nrepair to the pumps & fill their canteens; which being accomplished\r\nthey formed in front of the speakers stand and were addressed by Gov.\r\nRandall. They then marched to the cars, which had been run down to the\r\ncamp ground and filled two trains one of 11 & the other of 13 cars. We\r\nstood near the car which the Racine Co. entered and shook hands with\r\nall the boys as they passed.[59] Attended Prof. Carr’s examination of\r\nthe Chemistry class from 2 to 5 P. M.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY 21. Went strawberrying nearly all forenoon, and in the\r\nafternoon attended Dr. Carr’s examination. This exercise like his\r\nrecitation consists of lectures by the students on subjects which the\r\nDr. himself has previously discussed before the class. This P. M. was\r\ndevoted principally to Geology, and, although the boys had only since\r\nlast night to prepare their subjects, they were well handled both as\r\norations and as recitations Visited Camp in the evening. 1 Co. of the\r\n5th. Regt. has arrived (from Waukesha). The men are rather small but\r\nthe Co. is well officered and present a pretty good appearance. In the\r\nAth. discussed whether the time devoted to the Classics in College\r\ncould not be better employed--Decided affirmative\r\n\r\nSATURDAY 22. Went to the depot at 1 o’clock to learn the arrangement\r\nof trains &c. preparatory to going home. From thence up town--we\r\nvisited the Jail. There are only about a dozen prisoners there now,\r\nmuch less, they told us, than usual. One had his feet in irons having\r\nbeen attempting to break jail lately. Three of them were crazy.\r\n\r\nSUNDAY 23d--Went to the Catholic Church this morning at 9, but the\r\nfirst mass was nearly over when we got there & as we did not know they\r\nwould have another, we saw but little of their proceedings. Attended\r\nthe Episcopal Church & Prof. C’s Bible Class. The Baccalaureate Sermon\r\nwas preached by Prof. Butler in the Univ. Chapel at 4 P. M. His text\r\nwas Sol. Song 4:4 & his sermon, or rather lecture, the finest I ever\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [3] John E. Goldsworthy, a student from Union Grove, who\r\n     accompanied Reid to Madison and shared his room in North\r\n     Hall, then used as a dormitory.\r\n\r\n     [4] Simeon S. Bradford, a member of the Wisconsin Assembly\r\n     from Racine County. In his reminiscences Reid characterizes\r\n     Bradford, who was for a time his teacher, as “a gentleman of\r\n     excellent education, and a fluent, ready public speaker.”\r\n     Reid further states that he was descended in direct line\r\n     from Governor William Bradford of Plymouth. Before coming to\r\n     Wisconsin he had been principal of an academy at Homer,\r\n     Cortland County, New York, and had also published a paper\r\n     there for several years.\r\n\r\n     [5] Joseph W. Curtis of Madison.\r\n\r\n     [6] John W. Sterling, dean of the faculty and professor of\r\n     mathematics and natural philosophy. His connection with the\r\n     university lasted from 1848 until his death in 1885. He was\r\n     in turn acting chancellor, vice-chancellor, and\r\n     vice-president of the university.\r\n\r\n     [7] Rev. James B. Britton, pastor of Grace Episcopal Church\r\n     at Madison from 1855 until his resignation to become a\r\n     chaplain in the Eleventh Wisconsin Infantry.\r\n\r\n     [8] Rev. W. H. Brisbane. He became pastor of this church in\r\n     1860, resigning at the outbreak of the war to become\r\n     chaplain of the Second Wisconsin Cavalry.\r\n\r\n     [9] Prof. John B. Parkinson, now (1917) vice-president and\r\n     _emeritus_ professor of constitutional law of the\r\n     university.\r\n\r\n     [10] The _Lady Elgin_ was a steamer running between\r\n     Milwaukee and Chicago. On September 8, 1860, the vessel was\r\n     wrecked near Waukegan, as the result of a collision in the\r\n     night-time with another vessel. The _Lady Elgin_ had on\r\n     board several hundred excursionists from Milwaukee,\r\n     returning from a visit to Chicago. Of them all, only about\r\n     100 were saved. Among the victims were the editor of the New\r\n     Orleans _Picayune_ and his family, and the proprietor of the\r\n     London _Illustrated News_.\r\n\r\n     [11] David H. Johnson was a member of the assembly from Bad\r\n     Ax and Crawford Counties; Gilbert Knapp, from Racine County,\r\n     was the founder and first white settler of the city of\r\n     Racine. His title of “captain” was won by long connection\r\n     with the United States internal revenue marine service and\r\n     by his naval rank during the Civil War.\r\n\r\n     [12] The allusion is to the inventions of John Muir, who was\r\n     then a student at the university. For the story of his\r\n     inventions, and of his life at the University of Wisconsin,\r\n     see his _The Story of My Boyhood and Youth_ (Boston and New\r\n     York, 1913), chaps. vii and viii.\r\n\r\n     [13] Pliny Norcross of La Grange, George G. Green of\r\n     Milford, and Augustus H. Salisbury of Oregon. Norcross was\r\n     the first University of Wisconsin student to enlist for\r\n     military service, and his example, says Professor Butler,\r\n     “was followed by so many sons of Mars that the largest and\r\n     best Greek class I ever had was sadly thinned out.” Norcross\r\n     returned to the university after his three months’\r\n     enlistment had expired, but within a short time he again\r\n     left school and raised a company (Company K, Thirteenth\r\n     Wisconsin Infantry), of which he was elected captain. In\r\n     after life he became a prominent lawyer and business man of\r\n     Janesville. Salisbury was graduated from the university in\r\n     1867. He became a physician and made his home in\r\n     Minneapolis, where he died in 1893.\r\n\r\n     [14] William Fuller, from Union Grove, who boarded and\r\n     roomed with Reid and Goldsworthy in North Hall.\r\n\r\n     [15] James D. Butler, professor of ancient languages and\r\n     literature, and librarian. He was a scholar of note in his\r\n     day, who brought much distinction to the University of\r\n     Wisconsin and, after his retirement to private life in 1868,\r\n     to Madison.\r\n\r\n     [16] Obadiah M. Conover, professor of ancient languages and\r\n     literature in the university 1852-58. After his withdrawal\r\n     from this position he studied law, and spent the rest of his\r\n     career as Wisconsin Supreme Court reporter.\r\n\r\n     [17] Charles J. White had been Reid’s teacher in the Union\r\n     Grove school. Writing forty years later the pupil speaks of\r\n     him as “one who, to a marked degree, left the impress of his\r\n     fine character and careful scholarship upon all of the young\r\n     people who were so fortunate as to come under his\r\n     instruction.”\r\n\r\n     [18] At the outbreak of the Civil War the currency of\r\n     Wisconsin was secured in very large measure by the bonds of\r\n     southern states. Never considered wholly safe in the\r\n     financial world, these securities, as soon as hostilities\r\n     between the North and the South began, fell to a third of\r\n     their face value. Wisconsin bankers were unable to make good\r\n     the depreciation, and the value of their currency reflected\r\n     their embarrassment. On April 4, 1861, the bankers of\r\n     Chicago resolved not to accept the notes of 40 of the 109\r\n     Wisconsin banks. On the following day the Milwaukee bankers\r\n     rejected the notes of 19 of the institutions proscribed at\r\n     Chicago. This affected the value of about $1,000,000 of the\r\n     $4,500,000 of Wisconsin currency. Brokers in the state\r\n     during the succeeding weeks purchased the discredited money\r\n     at prices which rapidly sank to fifty cents on the dollar.\r\n\r\n     [19] George B. Smith was born in New York in 1823 and came\r\n     with his father to Racine, Wisconsin, in 1843. From 1844\r\n     until his death in 1877 his residence was at Madison. He was\r\n     the youngest member of the first constitutional convention\r\n     of the state, served as mayor of Madison several terms and\r\n     several as state legislator, was attorney-general of\r\n     Wisconsin for two years, and engaged in many other\r\n     activities of a public nature.\r\n\r\n     [20] Moses M. Strong, author of a _History of Wisconsin_,\r\n     had been since 1838 one of the leading public men of the\r\n     territory and of the state. John Y. Smith had settled at\r\n     Green Bay in 1828, and later at Milwaukee and at Madison. He\r\n     served in the first constitutional convention and was for\r\n     many years an influential editor and publicist. Smith had\r\n     made a speech denouncing secession and upholding the Union\r\n     and the administration at Washington. Strong also denounced\r\n     secession but argued that a union held together by force was\r\n     worthless and that compulsion should not be resorted to keep\r\n     the South in the Union.\r\n\r\n     [21] By the chair, according to the _State Journal’s_ report\r\n     of the meeting, which asserts that two-thirds of the\r\n     audience voted against tabling the motion.\r\n\r\n     [22] Rev. Lathrop Taylor, pastor of this church from April,\r\n     1860, till January, 1864. Except for these three years his\r\n     forty-seven years of service in the pastorate were passed in\r\n     Massachusetts and in Illinois.\r\n\r\n     [23] Ezra S. Carr, professor of chemistry and natural\r\n     history in the University of Wisconsin from 1856 to 1868.

High was graduated from the university in 1864. He\r\n     enlisted in the Forty-ninth Wisconsin Infantry and attained\r\n     the rank of adjutant. In later years he became a leading\r\n     lawyer of the Chicago bar, being granted the degree of LL.D.\r\n     both by his Alma Mater and by the University of Michigan.\r\n     James Bull became lieutenant-colonel of the Fifth Wisconsin\r\n     Infantry. Of him Professor Butler has said: “When this\r\n     stampede [of the students to enlist] took place we were\r\n     engaged in Xenophon’s _Memorab lia_. My own pocket copy,\r\n     Trübner’s edition, I gave to James M. Bull, one of my most\r\n     zealous pupils. It was his _vade mecum_ throughout the war,\r\n     and kept alive in him classical instincts…. The American\r\n     soldier found the notes of the Greek soldier a congenial\r\n     manual.” Bull returned to the university after the war and\r\n     was graduated in 1869.\r\n\r\n     [25] David Atwood, a native of New Hampshire, came to\r\n     Wisconsin in 1847 and became one of the leading newspaper\r\n     publishers of the state. His military title was gained from\r\n     his connection with the state militia. He served in the\r\n     state legislature and for a short time in Congress. He died\r\n     at Madison, December 11, 1889.\r\n\r\n     [26] Phineas J. Clawson of Waukesha, Gideon W. Allen of\r\n     Trempealeau, Farlin Q.

He was at different times\r\n     clerk of the circuit court, district attorney, and state\r\n     senator. Allen was graduated from the University of\r\n     Wisconsin in 1862 and, later, from the law school of the\r\n     University of Michigan. The greater portion of his career\r\n     thereafter was spent in Sturgeon Bay. Ball served in the\r\n     army where he became a captain and a major by brevet. In\r\n     1865 he was admitted to the bar and later became a prominent\r\n     lawyer and judge of Chicago. Vilas obtained his degree from\r\n     the university in 1865, adopted the profession of law, and\r\n     died in 1872 while still a young man. Leahy entered the army\r\n     and rose to the rank of captain. In after life he served in\r\n     the general assembly of Iowa and as Indian agent at La\r\n     Pointe.

Maxon came to Wisconsin in 1843, made his home in\r\n     Washington County (from 1846), and served numerous terms in\r\n     the senate and the assembly of the state; in 1865 he was the\r\n     democratic candidate for lieutenant-governor. He died in\r\n     California in 1887. Gill came to Wisconsin in 1856 and\r\n     opened a law office in Watertown. In 1860 and 1861 he was\r\n     the youngest member of the state senate. He enlisted as a\r\n     private in the army and rose to the colonelcy of the\r\n     Twenty-ninth Wisconsin Infantry. From 1866 to 1870 he was\r\n     attorney-general of the state. Hutchinson came to Wisconsin\r\n     in 1848 and settled at Prairie du Chien. He was admitted to\r\n     the bar and in 1856 was elected to membership in the state\r\n     assembly. In later years he lived successively in South\r\n     Dakota and in Chicago. Worthington settled in Waukesha\r\n     County in 1847. He served in the assembly and from 1855 to\r\n     1861 in the senate. The remainder of his active career was\r\n     devoted to the life insurance business at Madison.\r\n\r\n     [47] Charles B.

He served for many years as probate and as circuit\r\n     judge, and a number of terms in the senate and the assembly.\r\n     He was at one time speaker of the assembly and at another\r\n     time president of the senate, and beginning in 1863 was\r\n     three times elected lieutenant-governor of the state. He\r\n     died November 18, 1877, in his eighty-third year.\r\n\r\n     [49] Charles Hathaway Larrabee. He came to Wisconsin in 1846\r\n     and the following year served in the second constitutional\r\n     convention of the state. He served as circuit judge for a\r\n     number of years and from 1858-60 was in the national House\r\n     of Representatives. He entered the army shortly after Fort\r\n     Sumter was fired on, and before ill health compelled him to\r\n     retire rose to the rank of colonel. Upon leaving the army he\r\n     removed to the Pacific Coast, where he met death in a\r\n     railway accident in January, 1883.\r\n\r\n     [50] Leander F. Frisby of Washington County, Henry G. Webb\r\n     of Waushara, and Franklin Z. Hicks of Iowa. Frisby came to\r\n     Wisconsin from Ohio in 1846. In 1850 he opened a law office\r\n     at West Bend, where he continued to practice for thirty-one\r\n     years. He served as attorney-general of Wisconsin from 1882\r\n     to 1887. Hicks, a native of New York, came to Grant County,\r\n     Wisconsin, in early life and engaged in lead mining. He\r\n     served several terms in the territorial legislature and in\r\n     1846 as a member of the first constitutional convention of\r\n     the state.\r\n\r\n     [51] Company F, Second Infantry, Capt.

Douglas, famous Illinois senator and\r\n     statesman.\r\n\r\n     [53] Elias A. Calkins was editor of the Madison _Argus and\r\n     Democrat_, and one of the leading newspaper publishers of\r\n     the state. In 1861 he entered the army as major of the Third\r\n     Wisconsin Cavalry, having declined a commission as colonel.\r\n     After the war he resumed the newspaper business and at the\r\n     time of his death in 1904 was an editorial writer on the\r\n     Chicago _Chronicle_. L. P. Harvey was governor of the state\r\n     from January 6 to April 19, 1862, his career being\r\n     tragically cut short by drowning while engaged in a mission\r\n     of succor to Wisconsin’s soldiers wounded in the battle of\r\n     Pittsburg Landing. Myron H. Orton was born in New York in\r\n     1810 and came to Wisconsin in 1849, settling first at\r\n     Milwaukee and a few years later at Madison. He was a lawyer\r\n     by profession. He died at Madison in 1860. Jared C. Gregory\r\n     was born in New York in 1823 and died at Madison in 1892. He\r\n     served for twelve years as a regent of the University of\r\n     Wisconsin and from 1880 until his death as a curator of the\r\n     State Historical Society. Jairus C. Fairchild came to\r\n     Madison from Ohio in 1846. Two years later he became the\r\n     first treasurer of the state of Wisconsin, and in 1853\r\n     failed of election to the governorship by only two votes.\r\n     From the time of his first coming to Madison until his death\r\n     in 1862 he occupied positions of prominence in the city and\r\n     the state.\r\n\r\n     [54] Thomas Graham and Thomas St. George of Racine.\r\n\r\n     [55] Miss L. L. Coues. Because of lack of funds the board of\r\n     directors early in 1861 suspended indefinitely the public\r\n     high school. Miss Coues thereupon proposed, if the board\r\n     would grant her the free use of the building and equipment,\r\n     to maintain a high school free of expense to the board, on a\r\n     tuition basis. Afterward the arrangement was modified so as\r\n     to make the school one for girls only. Such, for two years,\r\n     were the high school facilities afforded the young people of\r\n     Madison.\r\n\r\n     [56] Milton S. Griswold of Waukesha and William Fallows of\r\n     Hanchettville. Griswold was graduated from the university in\r\n     1863, became a lawyer, and practiced first at Madison and\r\n     later at Waukesha, where he served at different times as\r\n     county judge. For an interesting account of his pedagogical\r\n     proclivities while at the university, see John Muir’s _Story\r\n     of My Boyhood and Youth_, 280-82.\r\n\r\n     [57] Stephen D. Carpenter, locally prominent as editor,\r\n     publisher, and inventor. He located in Madison in 1850 and\r\n     thereafter for many years was intermittently engaged in the\r\n     printing and publishing business. In 1853 he invented a pump\r\n     which is said by one authority to have brought him $35,000.\r\n     Among other inventions of his were a power-press, a\r\n     voting-machine, and a type-setting machine. He claimed to\r\n     have invented the first mechanical knotter for binding\r\n     grain. In later life his prosperity departed. He died at\r\n     Carthage, Missouri, in October, 1906.\r\n\r\n     [58] John G. McMynn, noted Wisconsin teacher and educator.\r\n     He came to the state about the year 1848, settling first at\r\n     Kenosha and then at Racine. He served as manager of the J.\r\n     I. Case Threshing Machine Company, regent of the University\r\n     of Wisconsin, superintendent of the Racine public schools,\r\n     and state superintendent of public instruction. During the\r\n     war he rose to the colonelcy of the Tenth Wisconsin\r\n     Infantry. He died at Madison in June, 1900.\r\n\r\n     [59] Thus the first of the seventy thousand soldiers who\r\n     were to pass through Camp Randall during the next few years\r\n     departed for the war. Of this farewell, and the further\r\n     record of the regiment Reid wrote in old age as follows:\r\n\r\n     “On the twentieth day of June, the entire student force of\r\n     the university formed part of the throng which assembled at\r\n     the railroad depot to witness the departure of that gallant\r\n     regiment, which was destined, before the return of its\r\n     remnant to the state, to earn the proud but sad record of\r\n     losing in battle more men in proportion to its numbers than\r\n     any other regiment which fought on either side among the\r\n     great hosts engaged in the tremendous struggle. That twenty\r\n     per cent of its entire enlistment fell dead on battlefields\r\n     during three years’ service cannot, indeed, be said of any\r\n     other regiment of any nation in modern times.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL FRAGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWISCONSIN’S FIRST VERSIFIERS\r\n\r\nThe first volume of verse printed in Wisconsin and written by a\r\nresident of that state, was long supposed to be a volume by Elizabeth\r\nFarnsworth Mears entitled, _Voyage of Pere Marquette and the Romance\r\nof Charles de Langlade, or the Magic Queen_. This book was published\r\nat Fond du Lac in 1860.[60] Recently, however, three different books\r\nof early Wisconsin verse have been discovered antedating Mrs. Mears’s\r\nwork, and since they are without doubt the earliest attempts at\r\nversification made in the Badger State, it seems worth while to\r\ndescribe them.\r\n\r\nThe earliest is a hitherto unknown edition of a book which is\r\nhumorously described by “Nym Krinkle” in his _Chronicles of\r\nMilwaukee_. Two editions of this book were published in New York in\r\n1848 and 1849, but the edition recently discovered was issued in\r\nMilwaukee in 1846 and, though bearing no imprint, is without doubt the\r\nproduction of a western press.[61] Its title is as follows: “The\r\nHistory/ of/ Black Hawk,/ with which is interwoven/ a Description/ of\r\nthe/ Black Hawk War/ and other/ Scenes in the West/ by E. H. Smith/\r\nMilwaukee/ 1848./ 12mo. pp. 6† 120.” This title is somewhat\r\nshorter than those of the later editions and the text varies\r\nconsiderably from that of the later issues. This edition has no\r\nillustrations, but the New York editions have several. The only copy\r\nthat can be traced of this firstling of the “Wisconsin Muse” is in the\r\nHarris Collection of American Poetry in the library of Brown\r\nUniversity, Providence, Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nThe next in point of time is a curious book, or pamphlet, with title\r\nas follows: “The/ Poetical/ Geography, [cut of lyre]/ with the Rules\r\nof Arithmetic in Verse, &c. &C./ By George Van Waters/ Published for\r\nthe Author by Sidney L. Rood,/ Bookseller,/ Milwaukee:/ Wilson &\r\nKing,/ 1848,”/ This is a duodecimo of ninety-six pages, with green\r\npaper covers. The cover title is somewhat longer: “The/ Poetical\r\nGeography,/ made to accompany any of the/ Common School Atlases;/ to\r\nwhich is added/ The Rules of Arithmetic,/ and a sketch of English\r\nHistory,/ in Verse./ by George Van Waters./ This work is sold by\r\nsubscription and cannot be obtained/ at any bookstore in the United\r\nStates./ Milwaukee:/ Wilson & King./ 1848./ Price 25 cents.”/\r\n\r\nThe end cover contains an advertisement of a line of stage coaches:\r\n“To the Travelling Public/ Stage Routes from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.”/\r\nSigned, “John Frink & Co., Proprietors,” The routes are to Galena,\r\nGreen Bay, Janesville, Madison, Fort Winnebago, Dixon, Chicago,\r\nSheboygan, and other places.\r\n\r\nMr. Legler informs me that he has another edition, which was published\r\nat Cincinnati. Several of the poems contain local allusions to\r\nWisconsin.\r\n\r\nThe book begins with “Geographical Definitions,” and the first lines\r\ndescribe geography:\r\n\r\n  The surface of the Earth, with all its tribes\r\n  Of sea and land Geography describes.\r\n\r\nThe divisions of water are next described, beginning with the\r\nfollowing couplet:\r\n\r\n  An ocean is a vast extent of brine,\r\n  Or salt sea water boundless and sublime.\r\n\r\nLakes are described as--\r\n\r\n  Fresh water seas, by land surrounded;\r\n  As Lake Champlain, whose waves by land are bounded.\r\n\r\nCouplets similar to these follow on straits, channels, sounds, rivers,\r\nand other divisions of water. After explanation necessary to the use\r\nof maps, there follows a poetical chapter on North America. Its capes\r\nand rivers are poetically described and then, in turn, its towns, each\r\nstate being separately mentioned. The author begins with Maine and\r\nends with his own state, Wisconsin. A chapter on British America is\r\nnext in order and this in turn is followed by chapters on Mexico,\r\nGuatamala, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The book ends with\r\nrhymed delineations of islands, volcanoes, and “The Rules of\r\nArithmetic” and a sketch of English history. A number of notes are\r\ninterspersed throughout the work, and a prose preface follows the\r\ntitle. A rhymed introduction is also introduced.\r\n\r\nThis book and also the following are in the fine collection of\r\nWisconsin poetry formed by Mr. Henry E. Legler, now in the possession\r\nof Mr. Henry C. Sturges of New York.[62]\r\n\r\nProbably the earliest specimen of German verse written in Wisconsin,\r\nis that from the pen of one of the German immigrants of 1848. Its\r\ntitle is: “Lieder/ aus/ Wisconsin/ von/ Adolf Schults./ Elberfeld und\r\nIserlohn./ Verlag von Julius Bädeker./ 1848.”/ This is a 16mo.\r\npamphlet of forty-one pages followed by an unnumbered page.\r\n\r\nThe copy I have seen has blue paper covers, with the title on the\r\ncover the same as the foregoing. On the back cover are advertisements.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet begins with a dedication to “Carl de Haas, Ph.D. The\r\nfriend of my youth, later schoolmaster in Wupperthal [the author’s\r\nbirthplace] and now farmer in Fond du Lac (Wis.).”\r\n\r\nThe first poem is entitled “Europa, alternde Königin.” The opening\r\nverse follows:\r\n\r\n  Europa, alternde Königin,\r\n  Dein abend ist gekommen!\r\n  Der fröhliche Morgen ist dahin,\r\n  Der Mittagstrahl verglommen.\r\n\r\nThe fifth and last stanza runs:\r\n\r\n  Europa, sterbende Königin,\r\n  Er wird die Herrschaft erben!\r\n  Die Krone, die dunkt ihm kein Gewinn,\r\n  Die lasst er Dir im Sterben.\r\n\r\nAnother poem is on the “Thal der Wupper, Mein Heimathland.” The eighth\r\npoem in the book is a stirring one on the Missouri River, “Missouri,\r\nMissouri, der mächtiger Strom,” while another is addressed to the\r\nauthor’s fatherland. In this he cries to the land of his birth, the\r\nland from which he has been exiled. The book contains altogether\r\nthirty-six different poems.\r\n\r\nOn the back cover is an advertisement of another book of verses by the\r\nsame writer, “Märzlieder,” which is advertised “to appear shortly.”\r\nThe publisher also advertises another book of interest to the\r\nWisconsin collector,--“Nordamerika Wisconsin. Winke für auswanderer\r\nvon Dr. Carl de Haas. Farmer in Wisconsin.” This is described as the\r\nsecond edition, with three views and a map of Wisconsin. The statement\r\nis made that the first edition of one thousand copies was sold within\r\nfour weeks. “Gedichte von Henriette Davidis, second edition,” is also\r\nadvertised. This book was printed by the Groteschen Buchdruckerei in\r\nArnsberg.\r\n\r\nThese three books are probably the earliest volumes of verse written\r\nand published by Wisconsin poets. They are of interest not only\r\nbecause of this fact but because each one relates in some way to\r\nWisconsin.\r\n\r\n                                              OSCAR WEGELIN\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM ON THE SPELLING OF “JOLLIET”[63]\r\n\r\nUsage in spelling names was very irregular in the seventeenth century.\r\nPeople spelled a name (or a word) just as it came into their minds to\r\ndo so, without fixed rules or custom. Thus the spelling of the name of\r\nthe discoverer of the Mississippi was varied--all the following forms\r\nbeing used: Joliet, Jolliet, Jolyet, Jollyet. Sometimes all forms were\r\nemployed in the same document. Marquette in writing an account of his\r\nexplorations speaks of his companion as “Jolyet,” “Jollyet,” and\r\n“Jolliet” indifferently.[64]\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances it remains to be decided what the present\r\nusage is, and on what facts it is based. Many, indeed most English\r\nwriters, follow Parkman, the greatest of our historians who have\r\nwritten on this subject, and use the form with one “l”--“Joliet.” This\r\nhas become a part of geographical usage, and we have, for instance,\r\nJoliet, Illinois and Indiana, and Mount Joliet. And Dr. R. G.\r\nThwaites, in his _Jesuit Relations_,[65] uses the one “l” in his\r\nspelling of the name. Later, however, Doctor Thwaites became convinced\r\nthat the double “l” was the better form and often so remarked to his\r\nassistants.\r\n\r\nThe change from “Joliet” to “Jolliet” is based first on the constant\r\ncustom of French writers, both in the Old World and the New. Pierre\r\nMargry, the great French archivist, the most learned man of his time\r\nconcerning New France documents, always speaks of Jolliet. Félix\r\nMartin of the Jesuit order, who wrote in 1861, uses Jolliet. Father\r\nTailhan, the learned editor of Perrot’s _Memoire_, uses Jolliet. The\r\nsame is true of John G. Shea, Henri Harrisse, Abbé Ferland, and\r\nJolliet’s latest biographer, Ernest Gagnon, who in 1902 published a\r\nlife of Jolliet derived from many newly discovered and hitherto\r\nunpublished manuscripts. All these authors were familiar with the\r\nseventeenth-century documents in the original form. They decided that\r\n“Jolliet” was used more often and more consistently than any other\r\nform, though all of them would admit that in many documents the\r\nspelling “Joliet” may be found. For example, the baptismal\r\nregister[66] spells the name by which Jolliet was christened,\r\n“Joliet.” While still a boy in the convent at Quebec he was known as\r\nyoung Joliet.[67]\r\n\r\nAfter Jolliet entered active life the name was usually spelled with\r\ntwo “l’s.” His earliest voyage is reported by the Sulpician, Galinée,\r\nwho met him in 1669 at the head of Lake Erie and calls him “le sieur\r\nJolliet.”[68] In 1671 he took part in the pageant of Sault Ste. Marie,\r\nwhen he was again spoken of as “le sieur Jolliet.”[69] Father Claude\r\nDablon, who first reported the voyage of 1673, says, August 1, 1674,\r\n“le sieur Jolliet” has come back from the West.[70] Count de\r\nFrontenac, the governor-general of New France, in his first mention of\r\nthe voyager, speaks of him as “Joliet”;[71] but thereafter in\r\nreporting his voyage and mentioning his maps he always writes the name\r\n“Jolliet.”[72] Several unsigned documents of the same period refer to\r\nhim as “Jolliet.”[73] In 1677 a concession in Illinois was refused to\r\n“le sieur Jolliet.”[74] In 1680 a concession of the island of\r\nAnticosti was made to “Jolliet.”[75] Many more similar documents could\r\nbe cited showing that the prevalent use in the seventeenth century was\r\nthe form “Jolliet.”\r\n\r\nLastly, how did the man himself write his name? A map published in Dr.\r\nR. G. Thwaites’s _Jesuit Relations_,[76] gives in the cartouche a\r\nletter signed “Joliet.” This has usually been supposed to be the\r\nexplorer’s writing. A glance, however, at two authentic signatures\r\nwill convince that he never wrote the name on the map. The first\r\nsignature is from a tracing secured by Henry Legler for an article in\r\nthe Wisconsin Historical Society _Proceedings_, 1905, page 169. The\r\nsecond is the signature to the marriage contract of which a facsimile\r\nis given in Gagnon, page 122. A glance will show that these two names\r\nwere written by the same hand, and both are spelled “Jolliet.”\r\n\r\nIn view, therefore, of first, the usage of the best French authors;\r\nsecond, the usage of the latter part of the seventeenth century, or\r\ncontemporary usage; and third, the signature of the explorer himself,\r\nthe spelling “Jolliet” is believed to be the proper one.\r\n\r\n                                          LOUISE P. KELLOGG\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST EDITION OF THE ZENGER _TRIAL_, 1736[77]\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Historical Society recently purchased an important file\r\nof the _New York Weekly Journal_, consisting of 136 numbers, ranging\r\nfrom December 17, 1733 to July 11, 1737. Bound in the same volume with\r\nthese issues of the second newspaper printed in New York is an imprint\r\nof excessive rarity--namely, the first edition of _A Brief Narrative\r\nof the Case and Tryal of John Peter Zenger_, 1736. Probably only one\r\nother copy--that in the New York Public Library--is extant. It is a\r\nfolio of forty pages, printed by Zenger himself, without a separate\r\ntitle-page. At the head of the first page is this title: “A Brief\r\nNarrative of the Case and Try/al of _John Peter Zenger_, Printer of\r\nthe/ _New York weekly Journal_.”/ The caption set between rows of\r\nprinter’s ornaments, and the colophon reads: “_New York_, Printed and\r\nsold by _John Peter Zenger_. MDCCXXXVI.” There are two lines of errata\r\nabove the colophon. The most striking peculiarity of the edition is to\r\nbe found in the pagination, pages 15 to 40 being numbered 17 to 42.\r\nJames Alexander prepared the narrative for publication.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous editions of the _Trial_, including four published\r\nin London in 1738. The present copy is in unusually fine condition and\r\nthe Wisconsin Historical Society is to be congratulated upon the\r\npossession (acquired with little effort, it is whispered) of this\r\nsuperlatively rare colonial imprint. It was picked up, so to speak, in\r\nthe East, almost at the threshold of several institutions that would\r\ngive much to place it upon their shelves. If put upon the market, it\r\nis not unlikely that the pamphlet would realize several thousand\r\ndollars. But, of course, no library ever parts with such a treasure.\r\n\r\nOf the life of John Peter Zenger little is known. He was born in\r\nGermany in 1697, but the name of his native place is not recorded. He\r\nis said to have been one of a large company of Palatines who were sent\r\nto America by Queen Anne in 1710. After serving an apprenticeship of\r\neight years to William Bradford, the printer, dating from October 26,\r\n1711, Zenger went to Maryland. Returning to New York, he there married\r\nAnna Catharina Maulin on September 11, 1722. This was his second\r\nmarriage, the date of the first being unknown. For a short time he was\r\nBradford’s partner. One book only is known to bear their joint\r\nimprint. In 1726 he started business on his own account, and it is\r\ninteresting to note that he printed the first arithmetic issued in the\r\ncolony--_Vanema’s Arithmetica_, 1730.\r\n\r\nThe administration of William Cosby as governor of New York,\r\n1732-1736, was marked by many arbitrary acts, which aroused deep\r\npublic indignation. “The oppressions,” writes Mr. Livingston\r\nRutherfurd in his useful book,[78] “culminated in the trial of John\r\nPeter Zenger which was one of the most stirring incidents of colonial\r\ndays. Its results were of greater magnitude than any of the\r\nparticipants could have imagined. It established the freedom of the\r\npress in North America, it wrought an important change in the law of\r\nlibel, and marked the beginning of a new era in popular government.”\r\nNor is this an overstatement of the case; for the trial of this humble\r\nprinter constitutes an important episode in our colonial history.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the _New York Weekly Journal_ came as the result\r\nof a determination on the part of the popular leaders to show Governor\r\nCosby to the people of the colony in his true colors. Zenger, its\r\nprinter, was probably aided financially in the venture. The first\r\nnumber was issued November 5, 1733--a folio of four pages. The chief\r\ncontributors were Lewis Morris, James Alexander, William Smith,\r\nCadwallader Colden, and Lewis Morris Jr. Apparently, Alexander was the\r\neditor, for among his papers are many articles intended for\r\npublication in the _Journal_. Zenger had been indifferently educated,\r\nand his skill as a printer was not great. Moreover, he was very poor.\r\nHe appears to have entered upon the project for commercial\r\nconsiderations only, and without any clear understanding of its\r\npolitical significance or of where it might lead him.\r\n\r\nThe _Journal_ was the sensation of the hour; in fact, it was so\r\npopular that of some numbers three editions were required to satisfy\r\nthe demand. Although it abounds in errors due to Zenger’s imperfect\r\nknowledge of English, it is in every way superior to its competitor,\r\nBradford’s _Gazette_, the organ of the Governor. “The paper was sold\r\nfor three shillings per quarter, and advertisements cost three\r\nshillings for the first insertion and one shilling for each insertion\r\nthereafter.” It contained many articles of merit--and was extremely\r\noutspoken!\r\n\r\nWith such an administration in power it is not surprising that all\r\nthis resulted in the arrest of Zenger on November 17, 1734, “for\r\nprinting and publishing several Seditious Libels dispersed throughout\r\nhis Journals or News Papers, entitled, _The New York Weekly Journal,\r\ncontaining the freshest Advices, foreign and domestick_.” After many\r\nvicissitudes, including nine months of imprisonment, Zenger was\r\ndefended by Andrew Hamilton, of Philadelphia, an eminent advocate\r\nnearly eighty years old, and acquitted. There was much rejoicing among\r\nthe people, for the victory was indeed a notable one, full of meaning\r\nfor future generations. Gouverneur Morris declared that “the trial of\r\nZenger in 1735 was the germ of American freedom, the morning star of\r\nthat liberty which subsequently revolutionized America.”\r\n\r\n                                            JOHM THOMAS LEE\r\n\r\n\r\nA NOVEL TRANSPORTATION DEVICE\r\n\r\nA recent request for information on the subject first brought to our\r\nattention the novel project of Norman Wiard for establishing a\r\nrapid-transit route between Prairie du Chien and St. Paul in 1859. A\r\nsomewhat cursory examination of contemporary newspaper files revealed\r\nthe notices of the project which follow. It seems probable that a more\r\nthorough search would disclose additional information concerning\r\nWiard’s ingenious project.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE ICE BOAT[79]\r\n\r\n                                 Prairie du Chien, Dec. 1, 1859.\r\n\r\n     EDITOR COURIER. Dear Sir: As there have been many\r\n     conjectures in regard to the Ice Boat published in the\r\n     various newspapers of the Northwest, I thought that some\r\n     definite and reliable information in regard to the invention\r\n     would be of interest to the public.\r\n\r\n     Norman Wiard Esq., the inventor of the Ice Boat, is now\r\n     constructing in New York City, an ice boat with a capacity\r\n     for carrying twenty passengers, and will be here with it\r\n     about the twentieth of December. He has proved to the\r\n     satisfaction of some of the most scientific men of New York\r\n     that his invention is a success.\r\n\r\n     It is intended by the parties having the route from here to\r\n     Saint Paul to stock the line this winter, and to be prepared\r\n     to do all business that may present itself.\r\n\r\n     The immense advantages arising to the Northwest from this\r\n     invention must be apparent to all.\r\n\r\n                                Yours truly, JOHN JAY CHASE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       ICE BOATS, CHARIOTS, CUTTER--LETTER FROM MR. WIARD[80]\r\n\r\n                                        New York, Nov. 22, 1859.\r\n                                        _169 Broadway, Room 35._\r\n\r\n     J. H. GREEN, _Editor of Leader_:\r\n\r\n     Please say to all, or as much of what I have written as you\r\n     please, in your own words, for I assure you I believe it all\r\n     myself, and I believe that many of your readers will be glad\r\n     to have the information.\r\n\r\n                                 Yours truly, NORMAN WIARD.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we say as requested, that Norman Wiard, inventor of the\r\nIce Boat, will be in Prairie du Chien before long with a\r\ntwenty-passenger steam ice boat, which he has now in process of\r\nconstruction at New York, and hopes by such means to keep open\r\ncommunication with St. Paul and Prairie du Chien, connecting, always\r\nup to time, with the Milwaukee & Mississippi Railroad.\r\n\r\nHe will also be prepared with a pioneer machine to level a track, when\r\nit is necessary, where the ice is rough. His twenty-passenger boat can\r\nbe raised or lowered, while in motion or at rest, to enable it to pass\r\nthrough a uniform depth of snow of three feet. It has devices that are\r\nample and practical, by which it can pass over or through snow banks\r\nand drifts; even if it should be run into a bank of snow twenty feet\r\nin depth and there stopped, it can immediately be passed through it or\r\nover it, or be backed out with the greatest facility. It is an\r\namphibious machine, is this Ice Boat, as it can be run off the ice at\r\na speed of twenty miles an hour into the water with safety; and it can\r\npropel itself across the water to contact with the ice on the other\r\nside, and get out upon the ice and be put again in operation without\r\nany material delay. It is, also, almost dangerproof; for, if it should\r\nbe thrown into the water by accident, on its side, or even bottom up,\r\nit would right itself instantly; and about thirty holes would have to\r\nbe broken in the hull before it could be sunk, even if it were full of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nMr. Wiard exhibited a model of his Ice Boat at the fair of the\r\nAmerican Institute, N. Y., and received therefor the highest award;\r\nthe operations of his model corroborate the statements made above;\r\nand the minutes of the Polytechnic Club, before whom he exhibited his\r\nplans at their request, says [_sic_] that the working of the model\r\n“proved his statements.” The practicability of the boat itself will\r\nsoon be tested on the ice of the Mississippi, and the judgment which\r\nwill then be pronounced [will be] a final one.\r\n\r\n[Corner torn off] driver only, and can go up and down hill and into\r\nthe water, safely! “Please to say all this,” says Mr. Wiard, “for I\r\nassure you, I believe it all!” So will we all, when we see it, and the\r\nsight is promised us.\r\n\r\nMr. John Cleveland, 35 Wall Street, N. Y., is now the trustee of the\r\npatent, and by the liberal subscription of a few intelligent and\r\nresponsible gentlemen of that city Mr. Wiard is enabled to fully\r\ndevelop and test his plans. The machine he is now building is said to\r\nbe beautiful as well as useful; and it seems likely to attract a\r\nnumber of New Yorkers to visit Prairie du Chien when Mr. Wiard brings\r\nit here.\r\n\r\nShould this invention prove to be a practical one, Norman Wiard’s name\r\nwill be ranked along with that of Fulton, Stephenson, and Morse. If\r\nhis machine should prove valueless, the worst that can or will be\r\nsaid, will be that he _deserved_ success.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE ICE BOAT[81]\r\n\r\nThe Prairie du Chien _Leader_ says it is not, and never has been, the\r\nintention of Mr. Wiard to test the practicability of his invention\r\nwith the boat half built last winter, and which remains in _statue_\r\n[sic] _quo_ yet, being too large, heavy, and unwieldy for the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [60] See article by Henry E.

Quiescent during its first few years, with the\r\ncoming of Lyman C. Draper to the secretaryship of the Society in 1854\r\nit immediately entered upon a period of aggressive activity which has\r\ncontinued without interruption to the present moment. During the sixty\r\nyears of the remarkable leadership of Dr. Draper and Dr. Thwaites the\r\nSociety deservedly acquired the reputation of being one of the leading\r\nhistorical organizations of the country. Our library, if not the\r\nlargest, is one of the best of its kind and in many respects its\r\ncollections are unique. In other fields of activity, too, the\r\nSociety’s achievements have been no less creditable to it and to the\r\nstate it represents.\r\n\r\nNo sadder disaster could befall the Society, however, than the\r\ndevelopment on the part of its members of a feeling of serene\r\nsatisfaction with the record of its achievements. As with all living\r\norganisms, we must go forward or retrograde. Only dead ones are\r\nstatic. The manifold life of our state and country is constantly\r\nchanging. If our Society is to fulfil its proper function, it must\r\nconstantly strive to adjust itself to the current developments of the\r\nworld to which it belongs. With the passage of time the ancient good\r\nbecomes uncouth and it behooves us to assume the new duties which new\r\noccasions teach.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit, after much thought and planning, we launch the\r\nWISCONSIN MAGAZINE OF HISTORY. The problem of our historical society\r\ndiffers materially from that of many others, particularly those in the\r\nolder-settled sections of the country. It must justify the support\r\nwhich the taxpayers so liberally accord by rendering to the public the\r\nfullest possible measure of service, and to this ideal it has long\r\nsubscribed. Equally important is it, however, that the public should\r\nbe aware of the facilities for service which the Society possesses in\r\norder that these may be utilized. It is believed that the publication\r\nof a quarterly magazine, devoted to the historical interests of the\r\nstate will afford a better avenue of communication with the Society’s\r\nmembers and the general public than has been possessed heretofore.\r\nWithout sacrificing in any way the scholarly ideals of the Society, it\r\nis hoped to make the magazine as interesting as may be to the ordinary\r\nreader. As our immediate constituency we have in mind the seven\r\nhundred members of the Society, whose tastes and interests, we have\r\nfaith to believe, are shared by thousands of other citizens of\r\nWisconsin. The historical interests of the professional scholars among\r\nour membership are catered to by numerous historical reviews, but no\r\npublication meets the needs of the far greater proportion of our\r\nmembers who are not included in this group. To this constituency,\r\nprimarily, it is hoped the magazine will appeal. If this hope shall be\r\nrealized we will account the magazine a success. If it shall be\r\ndisappointed, on the contrary, the energies of the Society’s working\r\nforce will be directed to more fruitful ends as soon as this fact\r\nshall have been established.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR STATE FLAG\r\n\r\nHow many, we wonder, of those into whose hands this magazine may come\r\nare aware that the beautiful banner represented on its cover is the\r\nofficial state flag of Wisconsin? That the number is much smaller than\r\nit should be is certain. When we set out in quest of an example of our\r\nstate flag, our first application was at the nearby armory, but the\r\nofficer in charge confidently assured us that Wisconsin has no state\r\nflag, and appealed to Webster’s _New International_ to support his\r\nassertion. Notwithstanding the evidence of both soldier and\r\ndictionary, for over fifty years Wisconsin regiments have carried the\r\nstate flag, although its legal definition and precise present design\r\ndate back only to 1913. That our beautiful banner, hallowed on many a\r\nbloody battlefield, is so little known to our citizens is not at all\r\nto our credit. Nor is it creditable that the service flags in the\r\nhands of the custodian of public property at the capitol fail in\r\nalmost every respect to conform to the official specifications for the\r\nstate flag as set forth in the statutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIETY AND THE LEGISLATURE\r\n\r\nMembers and friends of the Society may congratulate themselves, on the\r\nwhole, on the treatment accorded it by the state legislature of 1917.\r\nIn view of economic and political conditions generally, and of the\r\nlocal political situation in particular, it was to have been expected\r\nthat the legislators would scrutinize our budget estimates with care,\r\nand that enthusiasm for new advances, whether in work or in\r\nappropriations, would be conspicuous by its absence. It is gratifying\r\nto record that the members of the joint finance committee of the two\r\nhouses accorded the representatives of the Society an appreciative\r\nhearing and manifested a desire to provide for its activities during\r\nthe coming biennium with enlightened, albeit prudent, liberality.\r\nSince the task of presenting the Society’s needs to the legislature\r\ndevolves chiefly upon the writer of these lines, the occasion is\r\ngladly improved to acknowledge in particular the broad-minded attitude\r\nof Senator Platt Whitman of Highland, and Assemblyman E. A. Everett of\r\nEagle River, chairmen of the joint finance committee.\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view, however, the present financial situation of\r\nthe Society is far from gratifying. It is running on substantially the\r\nsame budget as was first laid down in 1912, and this will, of course,\r\ncontinue to be the case at least until July 1, 1919. No one who is\r\nmature enough to be reading these lines, need be told that the\r\npurchasing power of a given sum of money has shrunk alarmingly since\r\n1912. In effect, therefore, the Society’s income has decreased in\r\nrecent years in proportion as the cost of living generally has\r\nsteadily increased. To take a single illustration, the cost of heating\r\nthe library building in the year ending June 30, 1916, was (in round\r\nnumbers) $5,500; for the succeeding fiscal year it was $7,400; while\r\nthe estimates for the year just entered upon call for an expenditure\r\nof $11,000 for this purpose. Obviously the library building must\r\ncontinue to be heated. It follows, therefore, with the total income of\r\nthe Society stationary from year to year, that the additional sum\r\nrequired for coal must be gained by curtailing other activities of the\r\nSociety, which constitute its real excuse for existence. The\r\nimportance of this subject is such that a suitable occasion will be\r\nsought later to lay it before our readers in fuller detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST WISCONSIN CAPITOL AT BELMONT]\r\n\r\nNELSON DEWEY PARK AND THE FIRST WISCONSIN CAPITOL\r\n\r\nSeveral other matters of peculiar interest to the historically-minded\r\ncitizens of Wisconsin were acted upon by the recent legislature. We\r\nrecord with chief pleasure in this connection the provision made for\r\nthe preservation of our first territorial capitol at Belmont (now\r\nLeslie). Eleven years ago the superintendent of the Society, Dr.\r\nThwaites, made an effort to secure the restoration of this quondam\r\nstatehouse for a region imperial in extent, and the story of his\r\neffort is told in the _Proceedings_ of the Society for 1906. At that\r\ntime the legislature failed to act upon his sensible advice, however,\r\nand the matter was allowed to drop. At the recent legislative session,\r\nMr. M. P. Rindlaub of Platteville, veteran editor of southern\r\nWisconsin, took up anew the agitation for the preservation of the\r\ncapitol building. This time the advice was heeded and the sum of\r\n$3,000 was appropriated for the purpose in view. Mr. Rindlaub’s plan\r\ncontemplated the removal and renovation of the capitol and the making\r\nof provision for a permanent caretaker who, under the control of the\r\nstate conservation commission, should look after it. For these objects\r\nthe sum of $10,000 was asked. The amount granted will suffice but\r\npartially to execute the entire project, but it will at least insure\r\nthe permanent preservation of the building.\r\n\r\nThe action of the legislature in naming the state park at the mouth of\r\nthe Wisconsin was, in our opinion, distinctly unwise. Citizens of\r\nWisconsin do not need to be reminded that the historical association\r\nwhich provided the driving motive for securing this splendid tract for\r\na state park preserve several years ago was the discovery of the\r\nMississippi River at this point by the famous expedition of Jolliet\r\nand Marquette in 1673. Because of this fact, and of the additional one\r\nthat the park was bought by and belongs to the entire state, the name\r\neither of Jolliet or Marquette should unquestionably have been given\r\nto the park. As between these two there would perhaps be little reason\r\nfor preference were it not for the fact that Marquette has twice been\r\nsignally honored by the state (by naming a county for him and by\r\nchoosing him as one of the two Wisconsin characters whose statue is\r\nplaced in the national capitol) while to Jolliet no recognition,\r\nofficial or otherwise, has ever been accorded in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, the park has been allowed to exist for several years\r\nwithout a legal name. During this time residents of the vicinity\r\ndeveloped the habit of calling it Glenn Park, after former Senator\r\nGlenn who sold the land to the state, while the conservation\r\ncommission, as a matter of convenience, referred to it as Marquette\r\nPark. When a bill was introduced at the recent legislative session\r\nproviding that the park be officially named after Senator Glenn, a\r\nnumber of officers and members of the Society bestirred themselves\r\nto defeat the measure through the process of enlightening the\r\nlegislature with respect to the historical and other considerations\r\ninvolved. It is proper to record in this connection that Assembly\r\nKurtenacker of La Crosse, on being apprised of the situation,\r\ncheerfully joined with the representatives of the Society in the\r\neffort to have the bill which he had himself introduced by request,\r\nkilled in committee. This effort met with success, and the assembly\r\ncommittee on state affairs reported a bill to the lower chamber\r\nproviding that the park be named in honor of Jolliet. The assembly\r\npassed the bill, but in the senate it was amended by substituting for\r\nJolliet the name of Nelson Dewey, first governor of the state, and in\r\nthis form it became a law.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the motive which prompted the senate amendment was\r\nlaudable, but that the judgment displayed was weak. Apparently the\r\nimpression that the park should be considered in some peculiar sense\r\nas a perquisite of the people of southwestern Wisconsin, as opposed to\r\nthe state as a whole, could not be surmounted. With no remote desire\r\nto detract from the fame or merit of Governor Dewey, we do not think\r\nthe mere circumstance of his residence having been at Cassville\r\nconstitutes a pertinent reason for giving his name to this park, the\r\nvery existence of which is due to the famous discovery of June 17,\r\n1673. Incidentally, however, the entire discussion was productive of\r\ngood, since it called the attention of the public anew to the value\r\nand significance of the factor of historical associations in the\r\nselection of place names.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERROT STATE PARK AND JOHN A. LATSCH\r\n\r\nAnother park development of the past year which is peculiarly\r\ngratifying to the State Historical Society pertains to the new state\r\npark at Trempealeau. For many years the Society has been actively\r\ninterested in this locality because of the richness of its historical\r\nassociations. In particular, in recent years a series of historical\r\narticles pertaining to the locality written by Dr. Eben D. Pierce,\r\nmember and curator of the Society, has been published in the volumes\r\nof _Proceedings_. Largely through these activities the interest of Mr.\r\nLatsch, a leading business man of Winona, was awakened to the\r\ndesirability of securing historic Trempealeau Mountain and the\r\nadjoining river frontage as a permanent park preserve. To this end he\r\npurchased some 800 acres of land including the mountain and the\r\nadjoining river bluffs, and offered the whole as a gift to the State\r\nHistorical Society. Because the Society lacks the facilities for\r\nadministering such a trust, on the Superintendent’s recommendation the\r\ngift was diverted to the conservation commission, which is admirably\r\nqualified to administer it. At the time of writing these lines (July,\r\n1917) it only remains to complete certain legal details when the\r\nformal transfer of the property to the state will be made. Thus the\r\nfamous peak, noted by Pike and Schoolcraft and many another early\r\nexplorer, together with the site of ancient Fort Perrot, one of the\r\nearliest establishments of civilized man in the upper Mississippi\r\nValley, is added to our already splendid system of state parks. Aside\r\nfrom the historical associations of the place, the river scenery at\r\nthis point is rarely impressive and beautiful; while Trempealeau\r\nMountain itself is said to be peculiarly rich in botanical specimens.\r\n\r\nBut by what authority, it may be asked, have we headed this editorial\r\n“Perrot State Park.” Pressed for an answer, we must admit that the\r\ntitle expresses a hope merely, rather than a consummation already\r\nrealized. One of the motives, we understand, responsible for the\r\ninterest Mr. Latsch has shown in the matter was a feeling of\r\nveneration for his boyhood home and for his Swiss father who settled\r\nin Latsch Valley some two generations ago. Under the circumstances it\r\nwould not be strange if the donor, following the example long since\r\nset by a notable giver of libraries to the American public, should\r\nimpose as a condition of his gift to the state the requirement that\r\nthe park be named in honor of his father. We understand, instead, that\r\nMr. Latsch himself desires the park to be named in honor of Nicolas\r\nPerrot, the famous French explorer, who passed the winter of 1685-86 a\r\nshort distance down the river from Trempealeau Mountain and within the\r\nconfines of the new state park. The fine modesty and sense of\r\nhistorical appreciation displayed by Mr. Latsch in thus desiring to\r\nhonor the intrepid explorer require no words of commendation at our\r\nhands. We may express the hope, however, that when a future state\r\nlegislature shall come to the task of bestowing a legal name on the\r\npark, it will possess a like degree of judgment concerning the\r\nhistorical fitness of things. Perhaps Mr. Latsch might insure this in\r\nadvance by making the gift of the land to the state dependent upon its\r\nacceptance of the name of Perrot for the park.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREST FIRES, GENERALLY AND IN PARTICULAR\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of Wisconsin’s development until the close of the\r\nnineteenth century, lumbering constituted one of the chief sources of\r\nthe state’s wealth and business activity. In 1860 the lumber industry,\r\nstill in its infancy in Wisconsin, ranked second only to agriculture\r\nin importance. The story of its rise and decline constitutes one of\r\nthe most important and thrilling chapters in our history as a state.\r\nIn this respect our history conforms to the general rule that in every\r\nnew country the natural resources closest at hand are the first to be\r\nexploited. Well had it been for state and nation had our lumbermen, in\r\ntheir mad rush to transmute our magnificent forests into gold, paid\r\nmore regard to the welfare of future generations and squandered less\r\nrecklessly this splendid “gift of the ages.”\r\n\r\nThis statement of these reflections brings us to the point of\r\nsuggesting the broader historical significance of Mr. Bracklin’s\r\narticle in the present number of the WISCONSIN MAGAZINE OF HISTORY.\r\nOne of the prolific factors making for the waste of our lumbering\r\nresources was fire. In the words of a recent writer this was “the\r\ndread scourge of the lumber industry.” The sawmills and sawmill towns,\r\nflimsily constructed of inflammable pine, were periodically swept by\r\nthe flames. Although the mills and mill towns were commonly rebuilt\r\nwith characteristic American vigor, the forest fires were the source\r\nof appalling loss to the state. Yet the public mind was for many years\r\nindifferent to these losses, and the fires were commonly left to burn\r\nthemselves out, with no human effort to impede or check the course of\r\nthe flames. In 1864 one of the greatest conflagrations which had ever\r\nvisited the state swept for weeks through the northern pinery regions,\r\nyet so indifferent were the people of southern Wisconsin to the matter\r\nthat it received scarcely any notice in the newspapers of this\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nOur numerous forest fires, then, have possessed not only thrilling\r\nhuman interest but vast economic significance. Mr. Bracklin’s\r\nnarrative describes a single personal experience with one small forest\r\nfire. What he experienced and here describes, however, applies with\r\nsuitable variation of details to hundreds of similar events in\r\nWisconsin. In this fact consists its broader significance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSOLATION FOR THE PRESENT CRISIS\r\n\r\nIt seems evident, from the sources of information at our command, that\r\nthe Imperial German Government counted largely on its ability to\r\nneutralize the national will of America by fostering among Americans\r\nof German descent a spirit of disloyalty to their country. That the\r\ncitizens of the Badger State in particular could thus be cajoled into\r\nplaying a traitor’s rôle was not only believed in Germany, but widely\r\nfeared in our own country as well. That our citizens of German descent\r\nshould be enthusiastic about going into the war was not reasonably to\r\nhave been expected; that, faced with a hard duty, they should prefer\r\nto play the rôle of traitor is quite another matter. We do not\r\nbelieve, and from the beginning have not feared, that any considerable\r\nnumber will make such a choice.\r\n\r\nIn such a time of trial and stress as the present we are fairly\r\nentitled to gain what comfort we may from an examination of our past.\r\nThe simple truth is that, with the possible exception of the Spanish\r\nWar, we enter upon the present struggle with more of unanimity and\r\nresolution than has been the case with any other great war in our\r\nhistory. Of our unfortunate divisions and discords during the\r\nRevolution and the War of 1812 every schoolboy is informed. The North\r\nhad little enthusiasm for the Mexican War and largely abstained from\r\nparticipation in it. The Civil War was a fratricidal contest, but the\r\nSouth eliminated from consideration, the people of the North were\r\nsadly divided in counsels and desires. That this was true of Wisconsin\r\nhas been largely forgotten by our citizens. The present generation has\r\nforgotten, if indeed it was ever aware of, the fact that Wisconsin was\r\nthe seat of a formidable copperhead sentiment during the war; that\r\nthere was widespread opposition to the enforcement of the draft by the\r\nfederal government; and that a largely attended mass meeting at the\r\nstate capital in April, 1861, after the firing on Fort Sumter, laid on\r\nthe table a resolution pledging support to President Lincoln. It is\r\ntrue the local paper declared, in the latter instance, that a majority\r\nof those present favored the resolution but were circumvented in their\r\ndesire by the chairman of the meeting; but even so it is evident that\r\nthere must have been a large element of opposition to have enabled him\r\nto carry through the maneuver. Notwithstanding the deliberation with\r\nwhich the recent legislature went about expressing its support of the\r\nnational government, it requires no hardihood to affirm that no\r\nchairman of a public gathering, however traitorous his desire, could\r\nhave prevented a Madison audience of 1917 from expressing its\r\nintention of standing behind the national government.\r\n\r\nTo touch for a moment upon another matter, the political ideals of the\r\nperiod preceding the Civil War were shockingly low in comparison with\r\nthose of the present time. If there has been any graft in connection\r\nwith the construction of our new $7,000,000 capitol, the public is as\r\nyet totally unconscious of the fact. Three-quarters of a century ago,\r\non the contrary, we could not build even a forty-thousand-dollar\r\ncapitol without a riot of mismanagement and dishonesty. The period of\r\n“Barstow and the balance,” and of the “forty thieves” signifies more\r\nthan the addition of a picturesque phrase to our political annals.\r\nInstead of constituting a rare exception, the political morality which\r\nthese phrases suggest was painfully commonplace in Wisconsin prior to\r\nthe Civil War. It was only a few years before we entered upon that\r\ngreat struggle that a powerful corporation brazenly established a\r\npay-counter at the capital and bought with paltry silver the entire\r\nstate legislature, and even the governor himself. Idealists are by no\r\nmeans satisfied with the political standards and practices of our\r\npublic men of the present day, but they are lily-white in comparison\r\nwith the similar standards of the fifties in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nOr again, let us glance by way of comparison at the financial\r\nsituation. The diary of Harvey Reid, published elsewhere in this\r\nmagazine, affords an inkling, at least, of our deplorable financial\r\ncondition in 1861. The national banking-system still lay in the womb\r\nof the future, while the treacherous “wild cats” flourished at the\r\nexpense alike of private fortunes and public credit. With the first\r\nbreath of war these institutions toppled in headlong ruin,\r\nnotwithstanding that the state legislature, heedless of constitutional\r\nprohibitions, essayed vainly to prevent the crash. Within four days\r\nafter the news of the firing on Fort Sumter, specie payments were\r\nsuspended in Wisconsin; and the efforts of the government to float a\r\nwar loan of $1,200,000 on the credit of the state of Wisconsin in the\r\nsummer of 1861 met with dismal and inglorious failure.\r\n\r\nWe do not remind the present generation of these things in any\r\npharisaical attitude, but for the encouragement they afford to us at\r\nthis time. The outstanding fact is that in the very face of such\r\nconditions as we have adverted to, Wisconsin girded herself for the\r\ntask and played a noble part in the Civil War. We enter the present\r\nstruggle immeasurably better prepared from almost every viewpoint than\r\nwe did the one of old. If, as we believe, our people still retain a\r\nfair measure of pluck and ability, the record we are about to make\r\nshould be correspondingly better than that of fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE QUESTION BOX\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | _The Wisconsin Historical Library has long maintained a       |\r\n  | bureau of historical information for the benefit of those who |\r\n  | care to avail themselves of the service it offers.

This church was\r\n     built in 1857, dedicated in 1859, and has been in continuous\r\n     use ever since.\r\n\r\n     I have wondered if there is any older church still in use in\r\n     Wisconsin. I have gone through the records of two-thirds of\r\n     the counties of the state and, while I have found that many\r\n     churches were erected prior to this, these have all been\r\n     superseded by later structures. I wonder if your staff can\r\n     give me any assistance in ascertaining the existence of any\r\n     older house of worship?\r\n\r\n                                          H. R. HOLAND,\r\n                                      _Ephraim, Wisconsin_.\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest church buildings in Wisconsin is undoubtedly that\r\nknown as The Old Mission on Madelaine Island. This was built in 1839\r\nand dedicated in 1840 for the American Board of Home Missions, now\r\npart of the Presbyterian denomination. This building is now used for\r\nworship at least during the summer season, but has not been so\r\nemployed consecutively, as it was closed in the fifties and not\r\nreopened until 1892. In 1901 is was removed to its present location,\r\nand restored and redecorated in 1915.\r\n\r\nThe oldest frame church in Wisconsin was built in 1839 at Kellogg’s\r\nCorners, now Sylvania, in Racine County, for the use of the Methodist\r\ndenomination. So far as we can ascertain, the old church is still\r\nstanding, but whether or not it is now used for service we are not\r\ninformed.\r\n\r\nThere is a country church near Waterford in Racine County which was\r\nbuilt in 1846 and is still in excellent condition and in active use.\r\nOnly last year it was thoroughly renovated at a cost of some\r\n$3,500--several times as much as the original cost of the building.\r\nThis church stands in what is known as the English Settlement by\r\nreason of the fact that the community was largely settled by\r\nimmigrants from England in the early forties. The church is unique\r\nboth in its organization and in its history.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that while your church at Ephraim may be\r\namong the older structures of the state still used for religious\r\nservices, it cannot claim the honor of priority in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE FIRST MILLS IN THE FOX RIVER VALLEY\r\n\r\n     I am preparing recollections of early days in the Fox River\r\n     Valley and will be pleased to supply you with results of my\r\n     efforts in this direction. I am somewhat confused on some of\r\n     the items, especially the establishment of the first saw and\r\n     grist mill on the south or east side (my old home), of the\r\n     river and across from Kaukauna. My friend, Mr. John D. Lawe,\r\n     son of the late George W. Lawe, writes me that James M. Boyd\r\n     and Paul Hudon _dit_ Beaulieu, my grandfather, “built a saw\r\n     mill along the rapid,” etc. The date given by Mr. Lawe for\r\n     the building of the saw mill is 1832. A few years later my\r\n     father, Bazil H. Beaulieu, came in possession of both mills.\r\n     I was told when I was a boy that the mills were originally\r\n     built by the federal government for the use and purposes of\r\n     the Menominee, as also of the Brothertown Indians, the\r\n     latter being now scattered on farms on the east shore of\r\n     Lake Winnebago, across from Oshkosh. Furthermore, I was told\r\n     that the said mills were the second of the kind built in\r\n     Wisconsin, then the territory of Michigan. Have you any\r\n     facts or data at hand which might serve to verify or throw\r\n     more light on the subject?\r\n\r\n                                       T. H. BEAULIEU,\r\n                                  _White Earth, Minnesota_.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Fox River Valley mills, the earliest, both saw and\r\ngrist, were built by Jacob Franks on Devil’s River some time shortly\r\nafter 1800. They afterwards came into the possession of John Lawe, and\r\nwere operated by him for many years. Pierre A. Grignon built a grist\r\nmill on Reaume or Glaize Creek in 1810. This was used to provide food\r\nfor the war parties of Robert Dickson in the War of 1812. The miller\r\nwas Grignon’s brother-in-law, Dominique Brunette usually called Masca.\r\n\r\nAugustin Grignon built a grist mill at Kaukauna on the north side of\r\nthe stream, about 1818. Two years later the United States government\r\nhad a sawmill erected at Little Rapids to prepare material for Fort\r\nHoward and its outlying buildings.\r\n\r\nIn 1821-22 the Menominee, who had a village at South Kaukauna, sold a\r\nlarge tract to the New York Indians. In the latter year the\r\nStockbridge began to move to their tract, which began just above the\r\nMenominee village. The government had built for the Stockbridge\r\nIndians a sawmill, which was finished some time before 1830. At that\r\ndate a grist mill was proposed by the Stockbridge. Probably that was\r\nwhen your father took over the mills and repaired them, and perhaps\r\nenlarged them. The Brothertown Indians were settled with the\r\nStockbridge, and removed with them to the east side of Lake Winnebago.\r\nThe Menominee Indians had mills built for them by the government, but\r\nthat was after the Treaty of 1846, and they were built much higher up\r\nthe river, at or near Menasha.\r\n\r\n\r\n     COLONEL ELLSWORTH’S MADISON CAREER\r\n\r\n     I am collecting materials for a life of Col. E. E. Ellsworth\r\n     and would ask if you have in your library anything\r\n     concerning his drilling of the Governor’s Guard in your city\r\n     in the space between 1858 and 1860. I understand that his\r\n     stay was not very long, a few weeks probably, but I cannot\r\n     state definitely the year. It would be a great help to me if\r\n     you would look up this matter, and if you could send me full\r\n     information and copies of important phases relating in any\r\n     manner to his sojourn in your town, I would be greatly\r\n     obliged. I am in this work simply to resurrect and save from\r\n     oblivion the history of a great and martyred name of our\r\n     country, one which has been strangely neglected. The more I\r\n     study into his life and collect the materials from scattered\r\n     and almost forgotten sources, the more I am convinced that\r\n     he was a young man of remarkable genius, worthy of\r\n     perpetuation in the annals of the nation.\r\n\r\n     From the success that has so far rewarded my search, I am\r\n     encouraged to believe that ere long I will be in possession\r\n     of everything of real importance that belonged to his\r\n     career. I was well acquainted with his father and my home is\r\n     within easy reach of his birthplace. and of Mechanicsville,\r\n     New York, where he was buried and where a fine monument\r\n     stands to his memory.\r\n\r\n                                        C. A. INGRAHAM,\r\n                                     _Cambridge, New York_.\r\n\r\nWe find in our collections a few memorials of E. E. Ellsworth that we\r\nthink would interest you. In an old book of autographs there is a tiny\r\nphotograph that has been identified as that of Ellsworth. It is only\r\nabout an inch long and yet it is perfectly clear and well-defined; the\r\nuniform shows to great advantage, and there are three medals on the\r\nbreast of the coat. Among the other relics is a drawing about sixteen\r\ninches by twelve, the head of a fine-looking man with lifted eyes.\r\nThis is signed “Ellsworth” and “EEE.” It was presented to the Society\r\nby N. B. Van Slyke, who gave the information that it was a “Sketch\r\ndrawn by Col. E. E. Ellsworth in 1858 at Madison, Wisconsin, and\r\npresented to N. B. Van Slyke while the young man was at Madison.”\r\nPasted upon this drawing are several newspaper slips giving\r\nEllsworth’s biography, the last letter which he wrote to his parents\r\nfrom Washington, May 23, 1861, accounts of his death and funeral, and\r\na poem in his honor.\r\n\r\nUpon consulting the Madison newspapers for 1858 we secured the\r\nfollowing items: The Governor’s Guard was organized February 18, 1858,\r\nwith Julius P. Atwood as captain. April 20, the Guard appeared upon\r\nthe street for the first time trained by Lieutenant C. W. Harris. The\r\nGuard was very prominent socially, and gave many balls and soirées. It\r\ntook part in public celebrations on the Fourth of July, at the\r\nuniversity commencement, and at the state fair. June 25, the Guard\r\nfirst appeared in uniform. No mention appears of Ellsworth until Oct.\r\n15, 1858, when a Cadet Corps formed. Twenty-five Madison boys met at\r\nthe Governor’s Guard Armory, and Maj. E. E. Ellsworth, who was\r\nunanimously elected commandant, immediately put the cadets to drill.\r\nOctober 18, the Governor’s Guard was summoned to drill three evenings\r\nin the week, no spectators allowed. October 20 the papers contain\r\nnotices of the drilling of the cadets by their commandant, Maj. E. E.\r\nEllsworth, who “Is an accomplished and thorough drill master.” Another\r\npaper says the cadets “are ambitious to become the best drilled\r\ncompany in the State and their aptness has called forth a high\r\ncompliment from Major Ellsworth.”\r\n\r\nAn exhaustive search does not reveal his name again. On December 26,\r\n1858, the Governor’s Guard “were out in full uniform for the first\r\ntime since the State Fair and to us appear much improved in a military\r\npoint.”\r\n\r\nWe have not been able to determine what brought Ellsworth to Madison.\r\nW. J. Ellsworth lived in the city at the time. Possibly they were\r\nkinsmen.\r\n\r\nOne other relic of Ellsworth’s activities among us is in the Keyes\r\nPapers. In 1910, Col. Elisha W. Keyes wrote an article for the Madison\r\n_Democrat_ on the organization of the Governor’s Guard. In it he says\r\n“Soon after the organization of the guard he [Ellsworth] appeared in\r\nMadison and spent much time, without Compensation, in drilling the\r\nmen. He was then a young man, not much over 30 years of age. He had\r\nbeen an apt student of military science and discipline. His heart and\r\nsoul were in the work. His enthusiasm was boundless, although at the\r\ntime of his work here no one hardly dreamed that the rebellion was\r\npossible. Before he left he contemplated the full organization of the\r\neighteenth regiment State militia [of which Keyes was then Colonel]. I\r\nhave in my possession now a roll of maps and instructions for\r\nregimental drill, which involved much labor, that he prepared for me,\r\nas colonel, without reward.” These drafts came to the Society with\r\nJudge Keyes’s other papers. They are large map-like drafts, colored,\r\nof the positions of the regiment, and fully written out directions in\r\nEllsworth’s own hand for the various orders for military positions and\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nProbably you know that Ellsworth’s diary was given to Frank Brownell,\r\nhis avenger. We have two pamphlets giving liberal excerpts from the\r\ndiary, but we find therein no mention of Madison. Probably the full\r\ntext of this diary would show when and why he came to Madison.\r\n\r\n     Your letter of the nineteenth instant concerning Ellsworth\r\n     is before me and I wish to thank you earnestly for the time\r\n     and care which you have devoted to this subject; it\r\n     illuminates a portion of his career with which I was\r\n     entirely unacquainted and which to have searched out myself\r\n     would have involved much expense and inconvenience. Your\r\n     communication will be excellent to appear verbatim in the\r\n     book.\r\n\r\n     I am unable to say as to the identity of W. J. Ellsworth,\r\n     but I have written to an uncle of Colonel Ellsworth who may\r\n     be able to shed light on the matter. Colonel Keyes, when he\r\n     estimated Ellsworth’s age as “not over 30 years” when he was\r\n     in Madison, was evidently deceived by his remarkable degree\r\n     of development, which was in advance of his age: at that\r\n     time he was but twenty-one, having been born April 11, 1837.\r\n\r\n     Ellsworth’s diary I have not yet unearthed. John Hay’s\r\n     article published in _McClure’s Magazine_, VI, 354, has many\r\n     citations from it, but nothing concerning Madison. Mr. Hay\r\n     also contributed to the _Atlantic_, very soon after\r\n     Ellsworth’s death, a fine article on him (VIII, 119), and\r\n     the two comprise the best literature so far published on\r\n     Ellsworth. These two young men were students in Lincoln’s\r\n     law office, and Mr. Hay all his life down to his last years\r\n     mourned for him, whom he estimated as a most wonderfully\r\n     brilliant and patriotically devoted man whose future would\r\n     have been exceedingly prominent and useful. My own\r\n     investigations lead me to the same conclusion. Yet he had\r\n     very few early advantages; practically none, except a\r\n     limited district school education. His parents, whom I knew,\r\n     were plain people, and others of the relations whom I have\r\n     met or corresponded with exhibit nothing out of the common.\r\n\r\n                                        C. A. INGRAHAM,\r\n                                     _Cambridge, New York_.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE STORY OF “GLORY OF THE MORNING”\r\n\r\n     We are about to give the play _Glory of the Morning_. I am\r\n     under the impression that there was such a character in\r\n     Wisconsin as “Glory of the Morning,” and that she was\r\n     married to a Frenchman, and deserted by him, as in the play.\r\n\r\n     Can you give me any information concerning her?\r\n\r\n                                     (MRS.) F. H. ANDERSON,\r\n                                     _Brooklyn, Wisconsin_.\r\n\r\n“Glory of the Morning” was an historical character, and one of the\r\nstaff on the Wisconsin Historical Society related to Professor Leonard\r\nthe incident on which he founded the play. He has taken poet’s license\r\nwith certain parts--with the names, for instance, of the son and\r\ndaughter; but in _Wisconsin Historical Collections_, VII, 345, you can\r\nread the story as told by a French-Canadian trader. “Glory of the\r\nMorning” was a Winnebago chieftess, and Jonathan Carver, when very\r\nold, saw her at her village near Menasha, Wisconsin. The French\r\nofficer whose name was Sabrevoir Decorah (also spelled DeCarrie,\r\nDesCarie, DeKaury, and other ways), came to Wisconsin probably during\r\nthe Fox wars of the early eighteenth century. He married the daughter\r\n(“Glory of the Morning”) of the head chief of the tribe; resigned from\r\nthe army, and became a trader. They had two sons and a daughter. When\r\nthe French and Indian War began Decorah was summoned to become a\r\nsoldier, and he took his daughter with him to be educated in Canada.\r\nThe father was killed at the battle of Ste. Foye in 1760. The girl\r\nmarried a Montreal merchant and her son or grandson, Laurent Fily,\r\ncame to Wisconsin as a trader and lived for many years with Augustin\r\nGrignon at Kaukauna. Many of his letters are in the Wisconsin\r\nHistorical Library.\r\n\r\nThe two sons of the chieftess became chiefs of the tribe, and had many\r\ndescendants. The Decorah family in the nineteenth century was the most\r\npowerful of the Winnebago families. Several of its members still live\r\nin Nebraska. Two years ago an educated Indian girl, teacher of art at\r\nCarlisle Indian School, visited Madison. Her maiden name was Angel\r\nDecorah, and she traced her lineage directly to “Glory of the\r\nMorning.” The Winnebago name of the chieftess was Hopokoékaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE ODANAH INDIAN RESERVATION\r\n\r\n     Will you please give me some information concerning the\r\n     reservation near Odanah, Wisconsin? I desire to learn the\r\n     names of the chiefs who ceded the reservation and also the\r\n     terms of the cession; what each member of the tribe is\r\n     entitled to receive, and the address of the agent. I am\r\n     entitled to the same per-capita allotment as other members\r\n     of the tribe and this fact accounts for my interest in the\r\n     matter. Please give me, therefore, a history of the\r\n     reservation.\r\n\r\n                                          GEORGE ALLEN,\r\n                                     _Bay Shore, Michigan_.\r\n\r\nThe Chippewa of Lake Superior made a final cession of all their lands\r\nat a treaty held at La Pointe, September 30, 1844. In return for the\r\ncession, the government provided several reservations for the\r\ntribesmen. That at Bad River, of which the chief town is Odanah,\r\ncomprises 124,333 acres of land. This land, at the time the\r\nreservation was set aside, was heavily timbered. The Indians were\r\nentitled to annuities for twenty years, and each head of a family or\r\nsingle person over twenty-one years of age had the right to eighty\r\nacres of land. The chiefs who signed the treaty were members of the La\r\nPointe band.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the annuities were paid for the last time, according to the\r\ntreaty stipulations. Congress, however, in consideration of the\r\nIndians’ need, made appropriations to continue the payments for\r\nseveral years. After 1882 the Indian Department permitted the sale of\r\ntimber from the reservation; logging operations furnished wages for\r\nthe working Indians, and the sale of the timber placed a considerable\r\nsum to their credit. The Chippewa claimed additional sums on treaty\r\nstipulations. Whether these claims have ever been settled or not can\r\nbe ascertained from the Indian Department at Washington. As for the\r\nland, by 1913, 83,871 acres had been allotted in eighty-acre tracts to\r\ngenuine claimants. Enough of the reservation remains for more\r\neighty-acre tracts to be assigned to those who can prove their rights\r\nto claims. Timber is still being taken from the reservation.\r\n\r\nFor further information write to R. S. Buckland, special agent for the\r\nChippewa Indians, Baraga, Michigan; or to Philip S. Everest,\r\nsuperintendent, Ashland, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\n     FIRST EXPLORATION OF EASTERN WISCONSIN\r\n\r\n     I should be pleased to ascertain who was the first white man\r\n     to pass or voyage past the shores of Sheboygan County,\r\n     Jolliet and Marquette or Father Claude Allouez? Allouez is\r\n     said to have been the first to explore the west shore of\r\n     Lake Michigan, but I have not been able to find out whether\r\n     he reached Sheboygan County.\r\n\r\n                                          ALFONSE GEREND,\r\n                                         _Cato, Wisconsin_.\r\n\r\nWe dislike very much to say dogmatically who was the first Frenchman\r\nto skirt the coast of Lake Michigan south of Sturgeon Bay portage. The\r\nmore we study the subject the more we are inclined to believe that the\r\nrecords we possess reveal but a fragment of the activities of the\r\nFrench explorers, traders, and missionaries around Green Bay during\r\nthe seventeenth century. We do not know but that Jean Nicolet may have\r\ncoasted south in 1634; on the other hand, we do not know that he did.\r\nNo one has yet been wise enough to lay out the course of the\r\nwanderings of Radisson and Groseilliers. For my own part, it seems\r\nprobable that one of the first, if not the first, white Frenchman who\r\nvisited all the villages between Green Bay and Chicago was Nicolas\r\nPerrot, who between 1665-70 spent five years in the country, much of\r\nthe time with the Potawatomi tribesmen. Benjamin Sulte, a very careful\r\nCanadian investigator, asserts categorically that Perrot was the first\r\nwhite man at Chicago. (Sulte’s articles in French in the Canada Royal\r\nSociety _Proceedings_, 1903-13, throw much light on early seventeenth\r\ncentury conditions. They have never been translated, and are known\r\nonly to a few scholars.) So far as I am able to judge, however,\r\nSulte’s statement is based purely upon inference and is not backed by\r\na written account. Therefore, it is certainly fair to say that the\r\nfirst definite written record of white men skirting the coast of the\r\nwestern shore of Lake Michigan is found in the journal of Father\r\nJacques Marquette, who in September, 1673 came back to Green Bay via\r\nthe Chicago and Sturgeon Bay portages.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Father Claude Allouez, I think we can speak with more\r\ncertainty. He did not go to the Illinois mission until after the death\r\nof Marquette. He set out in the autumn of 1676 and wintered among the\r\nPotawatomi near Sturgeon Bay. You will find a synopsis of his voyage\r\nin _Wisconsin Historical Collections_, XVI, 96.\r\n\r\nYou may be interested in seeing a copy of _Early Narratives of the\r\nNorthwest_ just published by Scribner & Co. This volume contains most\r\nof the journals of these early explorers.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A COMMUNITY CHANGES ITS NAME\r\n\r\n     Some twenty-five years ago there was a place in Wisconsin\r\n     called North Greenfield. Evidently the name has been changed\r\n     for the reason that letters addressed to individuals at that\r\n     place are returned, with the information that there is no\r\n     such place in the state.\r\n\r\n     What is the present name of the locality formerly known as\r\n     North Greenfield?\r\n\r\n                                         SEYMOUR MORRIS,\r\n                                       _Chicago, Illinois_.\r\n\r\nThe post office, situated in Milwaukee County, and known as North\r\nGreenfield, changed its name about 1903, when it became West Allis.\r\n\r\n\r\n     HOW THE APOSTLE ISLANDS WERE NAMED\r\n\r\n     If such record exists, I should like to obtain from it a\r\n     statement of how the individual islands of the Apostle group\r\n     received their names, and how the group came to be named\r\n     Apostle Islands.\r\n\r\n                                         H. E. HALE,\r\n                                  _Minneapolis, Minnesota_.\r\n\r\nThe collective name of Apostle Islands for the group off the coast of\r\nChequamegon Bay is nearly two centuries old. The first map on which it\r\nappears is that of Bellin in 1744. This was founded on the information\r\ngiven by Father Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix, a noted Jesuit\r\nmissionary, who in 1721 visited the western country as an agent for\r\nthe French government. Charlevoix did not go into Lake Superior in\r\nperson, but at Sault Ste. Marie and Mackinac he made extensive\r\ninquiries of competent observers, and noted down the information given\r\nhim by traders and officers from that region. Thus he, no doubt,\r\nlearned that the islands were known to the French who frequented that\r\nplace as “The Twelve Apostles,” and as such they appear on the map of\r\nBellin that was issued in Charlevoix’s book published in Paris in\r\n1744.\r\n\r\nThe first English traveler to note these islands was Jonathan Carver,\r\nwho coasted the shore of Lake Superior in 1767 and on the map\r\npublished in his volume of _Travels_ (London, 1778) repeats the name\r\n“Twelve Apostle Is.”\r\n\r\nThe first American travelers in that region were those who accompanied\r\nLewis Cass, who in 1820 made an official voyage along the southern\r\nshore of Lake Superior. One of the members of this party was James D.\r\nDoty, who was afterwards territorial governor of Wisconsin. In Doty’s\r\njournal, published in _Wisconsin Historical Collections_, XIII, 201,\r\nhe says: “The Islands, called by Charlevoix ‘the 12 Apostles,’ extend\r\nabout 20 miles from point Chegoiamegon.” Another member of the same\r\nparty was Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, who later became Indian agent at\r\nSault Ste. Marie, and married a half-breed Indian girl descended from\r\nthe Chequamegon chiefs. Schoolcraft proposed to change the name of the\r\nTwelve Apostle Islands to Federation Islands. He assigned to the\r\nseveral islands the names of states of the Union, giving that of\r\nVirginia to Madelaine, the largest of the group. Schoolcraft’s\r\nproposal was not followed, but the present names of York and Michigan\r\nIslands seem to remain as part of Schoolcraft’s proposal. Apparently\r\nthe early traders, counting the islands loosely, thought there were\r\ntwelve in all, and since the mission was named Mission du Saint Esprit\r\n(or Holy Ghost Mission) the name of Twelve Apostles Islands seemed\r\nappropriate. There are (we believe) in reality nineteen, nevertheless\r\nthe name, Apostle Islands, has persisted.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the several names of the separate islands: We have\r\nabove accounted for York and Michigan. Outer Island explains itself,\r\nas do Ironwood, Oak, Basswood, Sand, Rocky, North and South Twin,\r\nBear, Cat (Wild Cat, no doubt), and Otter. Raspberry Island takes its\r\nname from Raspberry River. This name was used in its French form\r\n_Rivière à la Framboise_ as early as 1804 (probably earlier). See\r\n_Wisconsin Historical Collections_, XIX, 174. Devil Island and Manitou\r\nIsland are both the same name. That is, the Indians called all\r\nsupernatural beings “manitous.” Hermit Island and Stockton Island have\r\nprobably some local significance from dwellers upon their area. We are\r\nnot informed concerning them. Madelaine Island has been known by many\r\nnames. Its present name is that of the wife of an early trader, Michel\r\nCadotte. She was an Indian woman whose father was a local chief.\r\nMadelaine was the name she received when baptized. The island was\r\nfrequently known as St. Michel, or St. Michael’s, from the given name\r\nof Cadotte, who was the principal trader on the island for many years.\r\nIts Indian name was Moningwanekaning, supposed to mean the Place of\r\nthe Golden-breasted Woodpecker (hence, sometimes, Woodpecker Island).\r\nHowever, Father Chrysostom Verwyst, a Catholic missionary, now our\r\nbest authority on Chippewa place names, defines it recently in _Acta\r\net Dicta_ (July, 1916), published by the Catholic Historical Society\r\nof St. Paul, as “the place where there are many lapwings.” This island\r\nhas also been called La Ronde, for a French commandant of the\r\neighteenth century; La Pointe Island, from the name of the region La\r\nPointe du Chequamegon; and Saint Esprit Island from the early Mission\r\ndu St. Esprit mentioned above. It was also sometimes called Middle\r\nIsland as lying midway between Sault Ste. Marie and Fort William, the\r\nfur-trade post on the northwest of Lake Superior. Sometimes it appears\r\non maps as Montreal Island; the reason for this we do not know;\r\nperhaps it was the terminus of the trip from Montreal, Canada, or was\r\nso named because some of its inhabitants had been educated at\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: the largest island of the Apostle Group was first\r\nknown as Moningwanekaning or Woodpecker or Lapwing; in the eighteenth\r\ncentury as La Ronde, La Pointe, and St. Esprit; was known to the fur\r\ntraders as Middle and Montreal; was christened by Schoolcraft,\r\nVirginia; has been known since about 1800 as Cadotte’s, St. Michael’s,\r\nor Madelaine from its early inhabitants, and the baptismal name of the\r\nIndian woman has persisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE SERVICES OF THE MENOMINEE IN THE BLACK HAWK WAR\r\n\r\n     I wish to thank you very much for the information you gave\r\n     me in your letter of October 30, 1916. I would have answered\r\n     sooner than this but as you requested me to give you a list\r\n     of my grandfather’s descendants I wanted first to find some\r\n     one who knew how many children and grandchildren my\r\n     grandfather, Osh-ka-he-nah-niew, had. I have not been able\r\n     to get this information from the old members of the tribe,\r\n     but as soon as I get it I will write you again and let you\r\n     know.\r\n\r\n     The name Osh-ka-he-nah-niew in the Menominee Indian language\r\n     means “young man.”\r\n\r\n     I received a letter from Mr. J. L. Baity, auditor of the\r\n     Treasury Department, Washington, D. C., dated November 25,\r\n     1916, in which he says:\r\n\r\n     “With return of the letter from the Superintendent of the\r\n     State Historical Society of Wisconsin, dated October 30,\r\n     1916, addressed to Mr. Mitchell Oshkenaniew, you are advised\r\n     that the information set forth in said letter is too meager\r\n     for the War Department to establish the service of\r\n     ‘Oshkenaniew’ Menominee Indian Warrior Black Hawk War 1832,\r\n     and until sufficient information can be furnished setting\r\n     forth the organization in which service was rendered\r\n     together with the period of service and the names of some\r\n     commanding officer, no further action will be taken on the\r\n     claim.”\r\n\r\n                                      MITCHELL OSHKENANIEW,\r\n                                       _Neopit, Wisconsin_.\r\n\r\nCol. George Boyd was Indian agent at Green Bay in the summer of 1832;\r\nhe replaced Col. Samuel C. Stambaugh early in June. Stambaugh,\r\nalthough superseded, did not immediately leave Green Bay and was very\r\npopular with the Menominee tribe. During the course of the war, when\r\nall trace of the whereabouts of the Sauk band had been lost, Gen.\r\nHenry Atkinson, encamped on Whitewater River in Wisconsin, sent Col.\r\nWilliam S. Hamilton (son of Alexander Hamilton) to Colonel Boyd at\r\nGreen Bay. Atkinson feared that Black Hawk and the Sauk hostiles would\r\nattempt to escape to the British at Malden, and he therefore ordered\r\nBoyd to enlist and equip as large a body of Menominee Indians as\r\npossible to try to intercept them. Boyd at once called the Menominee\r\ntogether. They were willing to go to war against the Sauk if they\r\nmight have officers of their own choosing. Col. S. C. Stambaugh was\r\nthereupon made commander-in-chief. The second place was offered to\r\nCol. W. S. Hamilton, but he declined the honor. The Menominee turned\r\nout about three hundred warriors, who were organized into two\r\ncompanies commanded by the following officers: 1st Company; Augustin\r\nGrignon, captain, Charles A. Grignon Jr., first lieutenant; 2d\r\nCompany; George Johnston, captain, James M. Boyd, first lieutenant,\r\nWilliam Powell, second lieutenant and interpreter. Alexander J. Irwin\r\nwas charged with the commissariat with rank of first lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to suppose that Osh-ka-he-nah-niew was a member\r\nof the first company. Augustin Grignon told Doctor Draper that this\r\nIndian was in the war, and in all probability he named members of his\r\nown command. Robert Grignon of this company received a wound in\r\naction, and was in receipt of a pension until his death.\r\n\r\nThe documentary material in the Wisconsin Historical Library includes\r\nthe official papers of Col. George Boyd, Indian agent. Those relating\r\nto the Menominee contingent under Stambaugh in the Black Hawk War are\r\npublished in _Wisconsin Historical Collections_, XII, 270-98. It will\r\nbe noticed that August 12, 1832, Boyd wrote that Stambaugh had\r\ninformed him that he had arrived at Fort Winnebago with his command,\r\nthree hundred Menominees, and was on his way to report to General\r\nScott. September 2, 1832, Boyd wrote to G. B. Porter, governor of\r\nMichigan territory, enclosing Stambaugh’s report of the expedition and\r\nthe Muster Rolls of the Menominee. These should be in the War\r\nDepartment at Washington.\r\n\r\nThe well-known fact that Osh-ka-he-nah-niew took part in the Black\r\nHawk War, that he was part of Stambaugh’s band, probably under Capt.\r\nAugustin Grignon, seems to us established by the historical evidence.\r\nHis name on a muster roll must be sought in the documentary material\r\nat Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURVEY OF HISTORICAL ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIETY AND THE STATE\r\n\r\nSince the sixty-fourth meeting in October, 1916, four life and\r\ntwenty-four annual members have been enrolled in the State Historical\r\nSociety. The new life members are: R. C. Ballard-Thruston of\r\nLouisville, Kentucky, John Strange of Neenah, Chester Lloyd Jones of\r\nMadison, and Harry W. Bolens of Port Washington. The annual members\r\nare Dr. James S. Reeve and Henry L. Tinker of Appleton; John T.\r\nDurward of Baraboo; John J. Wood of Berlin; Leland S. Kemnitz of\r\nDetroit, Michigan; Amasa J. Edminster and R. C. Rodecker of Holcombe;\r\nOscar G. Boisseau of Holden, Missouri; Walter M. Atwood, William H.\r\nFaust, Clarence B. Lester, Edwin C. Mason, Mary Oakley, Frederic A.\r\nOgg, and Mrs. Jessie Russell Skinner of Madison; Clarence R. Falk and\r\nArthur G. Santer of Milwaukee; Ruth Thompson of Minneapolis,\r\nMinnesota; Mrs. L. T. Hill of Sparta; Katherine A. Rood of Stevens\r\nPoint; John S. Roeseler of Superior; Arthur T. Leith of Washington, D.\r\nC.; E. P. Winkelman of Waterloo; and Philip B. Gordon of White Earth,\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\nIn the same period the Society has lost by death five of its members:\r\nDavid J. Ryan of Appleton; William N. Merriam of Duluth, Minnesota;\r\nHon. John A. Aylward, Gen. Benjamin F. Cram, and Justice William H.\r\nTimlin of Madison. Probably the list should include names of other\r\nmembers, of whose deaths the administration of the Society has not yet\r\nbeen apprised.\r\n\r\nBy the will of Hon. George B. Burrows of Madison, who died in 1909,\r\nhis entire estate was bequeathed, subject to certain contingencies, to\r\nthe State Historical Society. Through the death in October, 1916, of\r\nthe testator’s only son and heir the estate at length comes to the\r\nSociety. At the time of Mr. Burrows’ death in 1909 its appraised value\r\nwas fixed at $219,000. It is the belief of those best informed in the\r\npremises that its present value is considerably in excess of that sum.\r\nThe property will be available for the Society’s use when the usual\r\ncourt procedure shall have been gone through with.\r\n\r\nBy the death of Miss Genevieve Mills of Madison at the close of 1916\r\nanother important bequest to the Society became public knowledge. Miss\r\nMills made a will by the terms of which the Society is ultimately to\r\nreceive her half-interest in the old Mills homestead at the corner of\r\nMonona Avenue and Wilson Street, Madison. The will states that the\r\nproperty is given “as a tribute to the loyalty of my mother Maria L.\r\nMills and my father Simeon Mills toward the State and the State\r\nHistorical Society they loved and helped to found.” The sum realized\r\nfrom the property is to constitute a perpetual fund, named in honor of\r\nthe giver’s parents the “Maria L. and Simeon Mills Editorial Fund”;\r\nthe proceeds of the fund thus established are to be devoted to the\r\nediting of materials for middle-western history, preferably that of\r\nWisconsin itself. The present value of this wise gift is supposed to\r\nbe in the neighborhood of $25,000. How soon it will become available\r\nto the Society is still uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe last few months have witnessed an unusually large number of\r\nchanges in the staff of the Wisconsin Historical Library. In\r\nSeptember, 1916, Mr. Frederick Merk, for five years research assistant\r\non the Society’s staff, began an indefinite leave of absence, with a\r\nview to prosecuting his graduate studies at Harvard University, where\r\nhe had received a teaching-fellowship appointment. In January Miss\r\nLydia Brauer of the editorial staff was compelled by illness to\r\nrelinquish her position. In February Miss Alice Whitney, assistant in\r\nthe museum, withdrew to accept a much better position in the Emporia\r\nNormal School. The close of the fiscal year in June witnessed several\r\nresignations of long-time members of the staff. Miss Eleanore Lothrop,\r\nfor several years the superintendent’s secretary, withdrew in order to\r\naccept a position in the East. Mr. Lyell Deaner of the newspaper\r\ndivision answered the call of his country by enlisting in the army.\r\nOthers whose resignations went into effect in June were Miss Pauline\r\nBuell of the reference division, and Miss Ora Smith of the order\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nTo fill these and other gaps in the ranks of the Library staff the\r\nfollowing appointments have been made: In September, 1916, Miss Ruth\r\nHayward, for several years cataloguer in the Cincinnati Public\r\nLibrary, became a member of our cataloguing staff. In February, Miss\r\nGenevieve Deming and Miss Ruth Roberts, recent graduates of the\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin, began work as assistants in the order\r\ndepartment and museum, respectively. Mr. Gaige Roberts of Madison\r\nfilled the vacant position in the newspaper division. In July Miss\r\nMarguerite Jenison of Fond du Lac, a recent graduate of the state\r\nuniversity, began work as assistant to the superintendent and\r\ncalendarer of the Draper manuscripts. Mr. Theodore Blegen, teacher of\r\nhistory in the Riverside High School, Milwaukee, spent the summer\r\nmonths as research worker on the Society’s staff. Finally, Dr. John W.\r\nOliver, of the Indiana State Library, began work in September on an\r\nappointment as research assistant.\r\n\r\nThe current year of the Society (October, 1916-October, 1917) has been\r\none of unusual activity in the field of research and publication. In\r\nthe nine months ending July 1, 1917 three substantial volumes and two\r\nbulletins were issued, in addition to certain minor items. The volumes\r\nwere: _Frontier Advance on the Upper Ohio_ (_Collections_ of the\r\nSociety, Vol. XXIII), edited by Louise P. Kellogg; _An Economic\r\nHistory of Wisconsin During the Civil War Decade_ (_Studies_ of the\r\nSociety, Vol. I), by Frederick Merk, and the _Proceedings_ of the\r\nSociety for 1916. Each of these volumes will receive fuller notice\r\nelsewhere. The two bulletins were a _List of Portraits and Paintings\r\nin the Wisconsin Historical Museum_ and a checklist of _Periodicals\r\nand Newspapers_ currently received by the library.\r\n\r\nA new publication feature, begun in February, 1917, is a monthly\r\n_Checklist of Wisconsin Public Documents_. Each issue, appearing about\r\nthe tenth of the month, lists the documents of the state issued during\r\nthe preceding month. Of this publication the _Mississippi Valley\r\nHistorical Review_ for June, 1917 says: “This is a unique undertaking\r\nfor a state historical agency. The value to historians, librarians,\r\nand state officials, of such a series of bulletins makes it a welcome\r\nbibliographical addition.” It may be added that, so far as the\r\nSociety’s administration is aware, the undertaking is unique not\r\nsimply for a “state historical agency,” but for any agency whatever.\r\nThe Library of Congress attempts to do for the entire country what the\r\nWisconsin _Checklist_ does for our state alone. Useful as the Library\r\nof Congress list is, however, it cannot possibly cover the various\r\nstates with the promptness and comprehensiveness which attaches to our\r\nown list for Wisconsin. The credit for the conception of this\r\npublication enterprise of the Society and for its execution belongs to\r\nMrs. Anna W. Evans, chief of the public-documents division of the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nOf research enterprises under way but not yet completed, or if\r\ncompleted not yet issued from the press, the following may be noted. A\r\nvaluable account, as it is believed, of the public-documents division\r\nof the library, prepared by Mrs. Evans, has been long in the hands of\r\nthe state printer. Material for a succeeding volume of the Draper\r\nSeries (to be published as Vol. XXIV of the Society’s _Collections_,\r\nwith the title _Frontier Retreat on the Upper Ohio, 1779-1781_)\r\nshould, with reasonable promptness on the state printer’s part, be\r\ndistributed to our members about the time they receive this magazine.\r\nCopy for Volume XXV of the _Collections_ was given to the printer in\r\nthe spring, and in the usual order of things it may be expected to be\r\nready for distribution near the close of 1917. It consists of the\r\nletters of Edwin Bottomley, a pioneer Racine County farmer, written to\r\nhis father in England in the years 1842-50. At the time of writing\r\n(July) the preparation for the printer of a second volume of the\r\nDraper Calendar Series, is approaching completion, and its publication\r\nmay be expected to follow the usual interval of time required by the\r\nstate printer. Dr. Edward Kremers of the University of Wisconsin has\r\nbeen engaged for many months in the editing of what will become the\r\ninitial volume of the Society’s Hollister Pharmaceutical Series. More\r\ndefinite announcement concerning it may well be postponed for the\r\npresent. It is believed, however, that the Society’s constituency may\r\nanticipate with pleasure the appearance of this initial volume of what\r\nwill constitute a new and unique undertaking among American historical\r\nsocieties. Another, but minor, research enterprise under way is the\r\npreparation by Mr. Blegen of a comprehensive report on the Wisconsin\r\narchives situation--a subject, it may be noted, concerning which there\r\nis crying need of public enlightenment. To conclude this summary\r\ncatalogue, in the _Wisconsin Magazine of History_ the reader has\r\nbefore him the initial installment of the Society’s most recent\r\npublication enterprise.\r\n\r\nA sum of money has been placed at the disposal of the National Board\r\nfor Historical Service whereby it is enabled to announce a prize essay\r\ncontest open to public school teachers in each of the several states\r\nof the Union on the subject “Why the United States is at War.” To\r\nteachers in the public high schools of Wisconsin five prizes ranging\r\nfrom $75 down to $10 are offered; for elementary public school\r\nteachers, three prizes ($75, $25, and $10) will be awarded. Essays\r\nmust not exceed 3,000 words and must be in the hands of Waldo G.\r\nLeland, 1133 Woodward Building, Washington, D. C., not later than six\r\no’clock p. m., November 15, 1917. The awards will be made by boards of\r\nWisconsin judges appointed by the State Historical Society. The essays\r\nwill not be signed and the committees of award will not be informed\r\nconcerning the author’s names until after their decision shall have\r\nbeen rendered. In announcing the contest the National Board states\r\nthat it is intended to lay stress, in making the awards, on\r\nintelligent use made of such materials as may be accessible to the\r\ncompetitor living in small communities with no large library at hand.\r\nIt is to be hoped that a large number of Wisconsin teachers will enter\r\nthis contest. Every participant in it will be a winner; this\r\nregardless of whether he gains one of the prizes awarded, since the\r\nintellectual and patriotic stimulus he will experience will in\r\nthemselves more than repay the labor involved. For full particulars\r\nconcerning the contest apply at your nearest normal school or college,\r\nor directly to the National Board for Historical Service, 1133\r\nWoodward Bldg., Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nDr. E. D. Pierce of Trempealeau, one of the Society’s curators, has\r\nbeen engaged the past year in editing a history of Trempealeau County,\r\nto be published shortly by the Cooper Company of Chicago and Winona.\r\nIn this connection, the editor has been given the use of a short\r\nhistory of Wisconsin to 1848, prepared by Miss Kellogg for publication\r\nby the State Historical Society. Probably this narrative will appear\r\nshortly in this magazine. It was prepared with a view to placing it\r\nfreely at the disposal of county historians and any others who may\r\nfind it useful; this in the belief that since the subscription county\r\nhistory is often the only book of a historical character which comes\r\ninto the homes of our citizens, the Society is acting in line with its\r\nideal of serving the public as fully as possible by doing what it may\r\nto improve the quality of these volumes.\r\n\r\nAnother Wisconsin local history approaching completion at the hands of\r\na curator of the Society is the history of Door County by Mr. Hjalmar\r\nR. Holand of Ephraim. It is understood that this is to be published by\r\nthe Lewis Company of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh annual meeting of the Waukesha County Historical Society\r\nwas held at the Congregational Church in Waukesha on May 5, 1917.\r\nAside from business reports and luncheon and other social features,\r\nthe principal part of the program was devoted to two addresses: one by\r\nJudge C. E. Armin on “The Early Bar of Waukesha County”; the other by\r\nM. M. Quaife on Increase Allen Lapham. The Society voted at this\r\nmeeting to send its secretary, Miss Julia A. Lapham of Oconomowoc, as\r\na delegate to the annual meeting of the State Historical Society in\r\nOctober. This is an act which it is hoped will be widely imitated by\r\nthe other local societies of the state, since mutual encouragement and\r\nprofit will undoubtedly result from a greater participation by them in\r\nthe affairs of the parent organization.\r\n\r\nOn June 16, 1917 under the auspices of the Waukesha County Historical\r\nSociety, a bronze tablet in memory of Increase A. Lapham was unveiled\r\non Lapham Peak. Lapham Peak, until recently known as Government Hill,\r\nis the highest point in Waukesha County. From an observation tower\r\nwhich formerly stood within a few feet of the tablet it is said that\r\none could see, on a clear day, Lake Michigan on the east and as far as\r\nMadison on the west. No more appropriate spot for a memorial to\r\nWisconsin’s first great naturalist could have been chosen than this,\r\nwith its far-sweeping view of the beautiful lakes and valleys and\r\nhills of southern Wisconsin. The tablet was unveiled by Julia A.\r\nLapham, daughter of Dr. Lapham. Present also were two sons and a\r\ngranddaughter of the scholar in whose honor the assemblage had\r\nconvened. Addresses were given by M. M. Quaife of the State Historical\r\nSociety and John G. Gregory, editor of the Milwaukee _Evening\r\nWisconsin_. The tablet, affixed to a large gray boulder, bears this\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n                 LAPHAM PEAK\r\n              Elevation 1233 Feet\r\n     Named by the U. S. Geographic Board\r\n                 In Honor of\r\n\r\n              INCREASE A. LAPHAM\r\n    _Eminent Scientist and Useful Citizen_\r\n              MDCCCXI--MDCCCLXXV\r\n\r\n                  Tribute of\r\n        The Waukesha County Historical\r\n                   Society\r\n                     1916\r\n\r\nMr. W. W. Bartlett of Eau Claire, an enthusiastic cultivator of the\r\nlocal historical field, has been running for many months a series of\r\nlumbering articles and reminiscences dealing particularly with the\r\nChippewa Valley. He has recently given a lecture, illustrated with\r\nlantern slides, on the subject of logging in the Chippewa to an\r\naudience of Norwegian-Americans, most of whom were familiar with the\r\nindustry before coming to America. Mr. Bartlett is chairman of the\r\nhistory section of the Eau Claire County Defense Council.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural College of the University of Wisconsin has prepared a\r\nmoving-picture film depicting the historical stages in the invention\r\nof the Babcock test. Fortunately it was possible to have as principal\r\nactors in the scenario the two men who played the principal rôles in\r\nthe original discovery, Professor Babcock and Professor Henry.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Archeological Society, which holds monthly meetings\r\nduring the year in the Milwaukee Library-Museum, has been giving\r\nduring the past year a series of lectures on American anthropology and\r\narcheology, the subjects ranging from descriptions of the Eskimo to\r\nthe antiquities of Brazil. For the coming year President Barrett\r\nproposes a series of lectures which will constitute a course of study\r\nin American anthropology, with its relations to geology, zoölogy,\r\nethnobotany, folk lore, and the fur trade.\r\n\r\nThe Milwaukee Museum is planning to install a replica of Solomon\r\nJuneau’s fur-trade post, in anticipation of next year’s centenary of\r\nJuneau’s first appearance on the site of Milwaukee.\r\n\r\nOn February 22 the Milwaukee Old Settlers’ Club, organized in 1869,\r\nheld its annual banquet at the Pfister Hotel. During the year\r\nthirty-two of its members had been claimed by death. On May 17 many\r\nmembers of the club joined in celebrating the ninetieth birthday of\r\nFrederick Layton, the Milwaukee philanthropist.\r\n\r\nThe old settlers of Pierce and St. Croix counties held a “homecoming”\r\nat Ellsworth on June 20. The qualification for membership in the\r\norganization is forty years’ residence in the St. Croix Valley.\r\n\r\nOn January 17 the old settlers of De Pere met at the Presbyterian\r\nChurch. Speeches relating to the early history of the Fox River Valley\r\nwere delivered.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the summer session of the University of Wisconsin\r\nan archeological and local historical excursion was given July 7. This\r\nis the fourth time that Curator Charles E. Brown, assisted by local\r\nhistorians, has coöperated with the university in arranging such a\r\nfield day. The number of excursionists is limited to one hundred, and\r\nadmission to the privilege is eagerly sought by students from distant\r\nparts of the United States, who desire to learn of the first things in\r\nMadison’s environment.\r\n\r\nPageantry is proving one of the most attractive means of popularizing\r\nand visualizing history. At Milton College’s semi-centennial its\r\nhistory was vivified by a pageant written by the faculty and produced\r\nby the literary societies. West Allis, under the joint auspices of the\r\nschools and the library, enjoyed a pageant in the early summer,\r\nwritten by W. E. Jillson, city librarian.\r\n\r\nAt Monroe on June 7 the commencement exercises of the high school took\r\nthe form of a historical pageant. The Mitchell Park Sane Fourth\r\nCommittee provided a pageant for Milwaukee southsiders on our national\r\nholiday. A number of other pageants that had been planned have been\r\npostponed because of war conditions.\r\n\r\nSt. Gabriel’s Catholic Church at Prairie du Chien celebrated its\r\none-hundredth anniversary June 10-12. Bishop Schweback was the guest\r\nof honor. To this church undoubtedly belongs the honor of being the\r\noldest parish in the state, since the records preserved show that\r\nbaptisms and marriages were performed, and a cemetery consecrated in\r\nthe spring of 1817 by Father Joseph Dunand, a Trappist monk from the\r\nIllinois monastery opposite St. Louis.\r\n\r\nThe eightieth birthday of the Milwaukee _Sentinel_ was celebrated June\r\n27. This famous paper, whose editors have enjoyed national\r\nreputations, was first issued in the second year of Wisconsin’s\r\nterritorial career, having been founded by Solomon Juneau to herald\r\nthe fame of the east-side town whose interests he was promoting. The\r\npresent publishers issued a memorial edition of the paper on June 24,\r\ngiving a historical résumé of the _Sentinel’s_ past.\r\n\r\nNashotah House, the mother seminary of the Episcopal Church in the\r\nNorthwest, celebrated its seventy-fifth anniversary at the\r\ncommencement in May. The historical address was delivered by Rev. T.\r\nM. McLean of Duluth. This seminary was the outgrowth of the efforts of\r\nBishop Jackson Kemper, whose extensive private papers, fully\r\nillustrating his missionary career, are included in the State\r\nHistorical Society’s manuscript collections.\r\n\r\nThe seventy-first anniversary of the inauguration of Solomon Juneau as\r\nfirst mayor of Milwaukee was noticed by the city press, which\r\npublished an illustration of the First Spring Street Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church, within whose walls the ceremony occurred.\r\n\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of Milton College was celebrated June 16-20.\r\nSix college presidents of the state and the dean of the University of\r\nWisconsin participated in the exercises.\r\n\r\nThe Dania Society of Racine, one of the largest Danish-American\r\norganizations in the United States, commemorated its fiftieth\r\nanniversary on May 19.\r\n\r\nThe Seattle _Post-Intelligencer_ of February 25 printed an interview\r\nwith Edwin U. Judd, now living in his ninety-first year at Anacortes,\r\nWashington. Mr. Judd was a resident of Waupun during the fifties of\r\nthe last century and was the chairman of the Free Soil party for his\r\ndistrict when the Republican party was born in 1854 at Ripon. He is\r\nprobably the last survivor of those who signed the call for a mass\r\nconvention at Madison in July of that year. His recollections of Alvin\r\nA. Bovay and the motives for the caucus at Ripon, February 12, 1854,\r\nare interesting material for the historian of political parties.\r\n\r\nMrs. Louisa Sawin Brayton, first school teacher of Madison, died at\r\nher home in that city May 30, aged one hundred and one years. Mrs.\r\nBrayton came to Madison in 1838. She was a prophet not without honor\r\nin her home city; for many years her neighbors had delighted to\r\ncelebrate her birthday and the Brayton public school is named for her.\r\n\r\nProf. Frederick J. Turner, in recent years of Harvard University, but\r\nWisconsin born and bred, is a member of the National Board for\r\nHistorical Service, recently organized at Washington to mobilize the\r\nhistorical scholarship of the country to serve it in its time of need.\r\nProf. Carl R. Fish of the history department of the University of\r\nWisconsin is also a member of this board.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lois Kimball Mathews, associate professor of history and dean of\r\nwomen at the University of Wisconsin, was elected in April president\r\nof the Association of Collegiate Alumnæ, the largest organization of\r\ncollege women in the United States.\r\n\r\nLouis Sky, or Ossawah, of the Chippewa Bad River Reservation, was\r\nrecently granted a pension for his services during the Civil War. This\r\nrecalls the fact that numbers of Chippewa, Menominee, and Winnebago\r\nbraves went from our state to serve their country in 1861-65. Their\r\ndescendants are now offering themselves in considerable numbers to\r\nfight for Uncle Sam on the plains of France.\r\n\r\nThrough the generosity of Mrs. John H. Davidson, the Oshkosh chapter\r\nof the Daughters of the American Revolution has erected tablets on the\r\nIndian mounds at Oakwood, on the southern shore of Lake Butte des\r\nMorts.\r\n\r\nMilwaukee’s _Eintracht Gesellschaft_ was founded June 19, 1867. In\r\nhonor of the fiftieth anniversary a banquet was given on June 19 of\r\nthe present year.\r\n\r\nOn May 20, St. John’s Lutheran Church at Boscobel held a commemorative\r\nservice in honor of its founding fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nRev. T. S. Johnson of the Presbyterian Church of Beaver Dam had the\r\nrare distinction of celebrating this spring a pastorate of fifty\r\nyears’ duration.\r\n\r\nA large number of interesting and valuable objects were given to the\r\nHistorical Society for the museum during the first half of 1917. A few\r\nof the more important are noted below:\r\n\r\nThe four survivors of the volunteer fire company known as the Madison\r\nEngine Company No. 2, organized in 1856, have donated to the Society\r\nall their equipment and records, including a silk flag, silver\r\ntrumpets, brass lanterns, helmets, and belts. The patriotic work of\r\nthe pioneer volunteer fire-fighters constitutes an interesting chapter\r\nin the history of the state.\r\n\r\nWith the coöperation of various individuals and governmental agencies\r\nhundreds of war posters and other material pertaining to the great\r\nstruggle on which the nation is embarked are coming to the museum. A\r\nnumber of special exhibits of this material were held during the\r\nsummer in the museum halls. It is expected that in a future issue of\r\nthis magazine will be presented an article by Mr. Brown on the\r\ncollecting and the character of this contemporary historical material.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Thomas Wilson of Black Earth, Civil War soldier in the\r\nTwelfth Wisconsin Regiment, a collection of sixty or more tintypes of\r\nmembers of his company taken at Memphis, has been received. Mr. Wilson\r\nalso gave to the Society an army overcoat worn by himself and an\r\nofficer’s sword and sash worn by his brother, Captain Francis Wilson.\r\n\r\nTwo Spanish War mementos have been deposited in the museum by Miss A.\r\nC. Anderson of Madison. One is a Spanish flag taken from the custom\r\nhouse at Santiago by members of Company A, Second U. S. Cavalry, when\r\nthe city was captured in 1898. The other is a Moro flag captured in\r\nthe Philippines by the same company.\r\n\r\nThe class of 1897, University of Wisconsin, has given a three-inch\r\nshrapnel shell, properly cross-sectioned, of the type now in use by\r\nthe Allies in the European War.\r\n\r\nBy the will of the late W. W. Warner of Madison the Society has\r\nreceived a collection of Indian stone and other implements, and an\r\nelaborate Swiss music box. The latter is reputed to be the finest\r\ninstrument of its kind in the Northwest.\r\n\r\nDuring the current year especial efforts have been devoted to\r\ndeveloping the Society’s collection of newspapers. As a result the\r\nlist of papers currently received at the library covers in a general\r\nway every section of the United States and more intensively the\r\nmiddle-western section more immediately tributary to the library. If\r\nthis policy can be adhered to permanently, future generations of\r\nstudents who come to consult the library will find a much more\r\ncomprehensive and logically ordered collection of newspapers than do\r\nthose of the present time.\r\n\r\nAlong with this reaching out for current issues, the library\r\ncontinues, slowly but persistently, to add to its files of old\r\nnewspapers. The more important non-current newspaper accessions in the\r\nnine months ending July 1, 1917, are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Boston _News Letter_ (photostat copies), 1719-25.\r\n  Cherokee (Kans.) _Sentinel of Liberty_, 1879-80.\r\n  Fishkill (N. Y.) _Journal_, 1865-89.\r\n  Freeport (Ill.) _Monitor_, 1874-75.\r\n  Freeport (Ill.) _Bulletin_, 1868-69.\r\n  Freeport (Ill.) _Journal_, 1856-57, 1859-60, 1866-80, 1882-1913.\r\n  La Crosse _Tribune_, 1904-06, 1908.\r\n  Lexington (Ky.) _Western Luminary_, 1826-29.\r\n  London (Eng.) _Examiner_, 1808-29.\r\n  Milwaukee _Freidenker_, 1914-16.\r\n  New York _Citizen_, 1854-55.\r\n  New York _Herald_, 1849.\r\n  New York _Man_, 1834-35.\r\n  New York _Nautical Gazette_, 1874-75.\r\n  New York _Sentinel_, 1830-32.\r\n  New York _Times_, 1898.\r\n  New York _Workingman’s Advocate_, 1834-35.\r\n  Oconomowoc _Free Press_, 1858-60.\r\n  Philadelphia _Gazette of the United States_, 1791-93.\r\n  Portsmouth (N. H.) _Journal_, 1824, 1828, 1830, 1835-55, 1864.\r\n  Richmond (Va.) _State Journal_, 1871.\r\n  Racine _Advocate_ (incomplete), 1842-48.\r\n  Rising Sun (Ind.) _Indiana Blade_, 1843-48.\r\n  Seneca Falls (N. Y.) _Millenial Harbinger and Bible Expositor_, 1860-62.\r\n  Shanghai _North China Herald_, 1910, 1912-14.\r\n  Skaneateles (N. Y.) _Democrat_, 1844-49.\r\n  St. Paul (Minn.) _Northwestern Chronicle_, 1866-72.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association\r\nwas held at Chicago, April 26-28, 1917. Prof. R. B. Way of Beloit was\r\nchairman of the program committee, while Prof. Frederic Logan Paxson\r\nof the University of Wisconsin, as president of the association,\r\ndelivered the annual address. His subject was “The Rise of Sports,\r\n1876-93.” Other Wisconsin men who delivered addresses during the\r\nsessions of the association were Prof. James A. James, now of\r\nNorthwestern University, Theodore C. Blegen of Milwaukee, and Prof.\r\nSherwood of La Crosse. M. M. Quaife of Madison was elected to the\r\nboard of editors of the _Mississippi Valley Historical Review_ for a\r\nthree-year term, while all the newly-elected members of the executive\r\ncommittee of the association were educated at Wisconsin. These were\r\nProf. O. G. Libby of the University of North Dakota, Homer C. Hockett\r\nof Ohio State University, and Albert H. Sanford of La Crosse.\r\n\r\nThe important Bancroft Manuscript Collection at Berkeley, California\r\nhas been placed in charge of Prof. Herbert E. Bolton. Mr. Bolton is a\r\nnative of Wisconsin and was graduated at the university in 1895.\r\n\r\nThe annual address before the State Historical Society at the coming\r\nOctober meeting will be given by Prof. Frederic Logan Paxson of the\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin. Plans are being made for a more active\r\nparticipation on the part of local societies in the program of the\r\nannual meeting than has been the case in the past. With a reasonable\r\ndegree of interest on the part of the members of the state and local\r\nsocieties it is believed that a better and more profitable annual\r\nmeeting can be held than any in recent years.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\nVolume XXII of the Society’s _Collections_, _The Journals of Captain\r\nMeriwether Lewis and John Ordway_, distributed in the summer of 1916,\r\nhas attracted much attention at the hands of historical editors and\r\nothers. Of it the _Iowa Journal of History and Politics_ says: “It is\r\nperhaps not too much to say that, no publication of the State\r\nHistorical Society of Wisconsin possesses a wider interest than this\r\nbook.” The review in the _Washington Historical Quarterly_ concludes:\r\n“Those who have collected the works of Lewis and Clark should\r\ncertainly secure this book. It makes a rich supplement to any of the\r\nother editions.” In similar fashion the review of the book published\r\nin the _American Historical Review_ closes with the statement, “The\r\nHistorical Society of Wisconsin is to be congratulated on the\r\npublication of this volume.”\r\n\r\nVolume XXIII of the Society’s _Collections_ (_Frontier Advance on the\r\nUpper Ohio, 1778-79_) and Mr. Merk’s _Economic History of Wisconsin\r\nDuring the Civil War Decade_ have been distributed too recently to\r\nhave attracted much attention at the hands of the reviewers at the\r\ntime of our going to press. On the part of the newspapers of\r\nWisconsin, however, Mr. Merk’s volume has already evoked much notice\r\nand comment. The Milwaukee _Sentinel_ and other papers of the state\r\nhave republished numerous extracts from the book, while the Chippewa\r\nFalls _Independent_ devoted special attention to the chapters on the\r\nhistory of the lumbering industry in Wisconsin. The expected comment\r\nof our historical neighbors on these two volumes will be noted in a\r\nfuture number of the _Magazine_.\r\n\r\nThe annual volume of _Proceedings_ of the Society for the year 1916\r\ncame from the press and was distributed to our members and exchanges\r\nin July. The volume is longer than any of its predecessors, and the\r\nworkmanship of the printer is probably the best of any in the long\r\nseries of annual volumes put out by the Society. Aside from the\r\nbusiness report and other routine proceedings, the book contains eight\r\nhistorical papers. The most interesting and valuable of these is\r\nCaptain Arthur L. Conger’s study of “President Lincoln as War\r\nStatesman,” delivered as the annual address before the Society in\r\n1916. Unless we mistake greatly, this paper will quickly gain\r\nrecognition as one of the most trenchant studies yet made of Lincoln’s\r\ncareer. Four studies of a biographical character are the reminiscences\r\nof Father Chrysostom Verwyst of Bayfield and of Mary Elizabeth Mears,\r\nearly Wisconsin authoress; “New Light on the Career of Nathaniel\r\nPryor,” sergeant on the exploring expedition of Lewis and Clark; and\r\nan account of the military career of Major Earl, noted Wisconsin Civil\r\nWar scout. A study of “The Beginnings of the Norwegian Press in\r\nAmerica” reveals the fact, interesting to citizens of Wisconsin, that\r\nthis state, rather than its western neighbor, was originally and for\r\nlong the chief seat of Norwegian development in America. Hence the\r\nstory of the beginnings of the Norwegian press in the United States is\r\nalmost wholly a Wisconsin story. Another local study is that of the\r\nlong-drawn-out “Watertown Railway Bond Fight,” one of the notable\r\nlegal contests in American history. Finally, and of more general\r\nimport, is “The Dream of a Northwestern Confederacy,” which recites\r\nthe story of the rise and decline of the hopes of the Southern people\r\nto draw off the Northwest from the remainder of the Union and in so\r\ndoing to win the struggle for its disruption.\r\n\r\nBy the will of Joseph Pulitzer, the noted New York journalist,\r\nprovision is made for the establishment of an annual prize of $2,000\r\nby the authorities of Columbia University for the best book of the\r\nyear in American history. It is interesting to note that the first\r\naward, announced at the 1917 commencement of Columbia, was made, not\r\nto a professional historian but to a busy man of affairs, the French\r\nambassador to the United States, Monsieur J. J. Jusserand, for his\r\nvolume _With Americans of Past and Present Days_. The book includes\r\nfour important and charming historical studies. The longest,\r\n“Rochambeau and the French in America,” presents a narrative, based\r\nlargely on hitherto unused sources, of this able but neglected soldier\r\nin the war for our national independence. The other studies deal with\r\n“Washington and the French,” “Major L’Enfant in the Federal City,” and\r\n“Abraham Lincoln.” The latter paper is particularly interesting as\r\nshowing the contemporary French estimate of President Lincoln and the\r\npopular sentiment in France in favor of the Union. Thoroughly\r\nscholarly and charmingly written, the volume is commended as an\r\nagreeable companion for a leisure evening.\r\n\r\nA second annual prize established by Mr. Pulitzer is one of $1,000\r\nawarded for the best American biography teaching patriotism and\r\nservice. It was first awarded to Mrs. Laura E. Richards and Mrs. Maud\r\nHowe Elliott for their biography of their mother, Julia Ward Howe. The\r\nnoble career of this talented woman should ever serve as an\r\ninspiration to her countrymen. Especially at this time of stress are\r\nwe grateful for her immortal “Battle Hymn of the Republic.” Like M.\r\nJusserand’s book, the work is unreservedly commended to our readers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important and scholarly studies in the field of\r\nwestern history to appear in many years is Clarence W. Alvord’s _The\r\nMississippi Valley in British Politics: A Study of the Trade\r\nSpeculation, and Experiments in Imperialism Culminating in the\r\nAmerican Revolution_. The book is beautifully printed in two volumes\r\nby Arthur H. Clark of Cleveland. It is Professor Alvord’s contention\r\nthat the seeker after the causes leading to the American Revolution\r\nwill find them chiefly in connection with the policies and efforts of\r\nthe British ministers to organize the imperial American domain which\r\ncame to it from France in the Seven Years’ War, rather than in the\r\nincidents and events along the Atlantic seaboard to which historians\r\nhave paid chief attention hitherto.\r\n\r\nOf particular interest to Wisconsin readers is the volume, _Early\r\nNarratives of the Northwest, 1634-1699_, edited by Louise P. Kellogg\r\nof the Society’s staff for the _Original Narratives of American\r\nHistory_ series. In this volume have been gathered, with appropriate\r\nediting, the principal classics of northwestern exploration in the\r\nseventeenth century. Included are the narratives of (or concerning)\r\nNicolet, Radisson, Perrot, Allouez, Dollier and Galinée, Jolliet and\r\nMarquette, La Salle, Duluth, and St. Cosme. Thus at length we have\r\nassembled in convenient form the more important sources for the\r\nearliest history of this region, so that anyone who will, may easily\r\navail himself of them. With this volume the important series of\r\n_Original Narratives of Early American History_, sponsored by the\r\nAmerican Historical Association and under the general editorship of\r\nDr. J. Franklin Jameson of Washington, concludes. It is interesting to\r\nnote that the series was begun and finished by Madison scholars, Prof.\r\nJulius Olson having edited (jointly with Professor Bourne) the first\r\nvolume and Miss Kellogg the final one.\r\n\r\nMr. Lucius C. Colman of La Crosse has had reprinted by photomechanical\r\nprocess from the copy in the Wisconsin Historical Library the rare\r\n_Brief Sketch of La Crosse Wisc’n_ published in 1854 by Rev. Spencer\r\nCarr. The work, a pamphlet of twenty-eight pages, may be regarded as a\r\ncity history, directory, census, and promoting tract all in one. From\r\nit we learn that in January, 1854, La Crosse had a total population of\r\n745. Indicative of the character of the place at this time is the\r\nfurther information that, among this population were 78 “single\r\nGentlemen” and but 38 “single Ladies.” In view of the fact that less\r\nthan three years earlier there were but five families in La Crosse,\r\nthe author’s generally optimistic view of the town’s advantages and\r\nfuture prospects seems fairly justified. A further indication of the\r\nroseate future which the townsmen saw in prospect is afforded by the\r\nenumeration among the 745 persons in the community of 9 physicians and\r\n12 lawyers.\r\n\r\nOf Ulysses S. Grant, conqueror of the Confederacy, many biographies\r\nhave been written. The recently published biography by Louis A.\r\nCoolidge is one of the best in the series, although it still remains\r\nto write an entirely satisfactory account of Grant’s career. Mr.\r\nCoolidge’s biography devotes a relatively large amount of space to\r\nGrant’s later civilian career (over three-fifths of the volume). The\r\nauthor believes and seeks to show that Grant was a greater statesman\r\nand more successful president than he is commonly believed to have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nThe Historical Department of Iowa has issued _Downing’s Civil War\r\nDiary_, edited by Prof. O. B. Clark of Des Moines. Alexander G.\r\nDowning was a sergeant in the Eleventh Iowa Infantry. He served from\r\n1861 to 1865, a period during which he succeeded in participating in\r\nnearly forty battles and skirmishes. Like the _Artilleryman’s Diary_\r\nof Jenkin Lloyd Jones, published by the Wisconsin History Commission\r\nthree years ago, Downing’s diary gives a valuable first-hand picture\r\nof the war as seen from the standpoint of the soldier in the ranks.\r\nUnlike the _Artilleryman’s Diary_, however, Downing’s diary, as\r\nprinted, does not reproduce the original record. Instead, it is a\r\ncomposite made up by the editor from the original diary plus a revised\r\nversion written out by Mr. Downing in old age, together with such\r\nalterations as the editor deemed desirable. The editor’s work seems to\r\nhave been done skillfully on the whole, and author, editor, and\r\nhistorical department are to be congratulated on the publication of\r\nthe book. As with the _Artilleryman’s Diary_, not much of commendation\r\ncan be accorded the physical makeup of the book. So worthy a record\r\nwas deserving of a better dress.\r\n\r\nFor several years the Lakeside Press of Chicago has published an\r\nannual Christmas volume of a historical character for complimentary\r\ndistribution to patrons and friends. The volume published in 1916 was\r\na reprint of the autobiography of Black Hawk, the famous Sauk chief,\r\nand was edited by M. M. Quaife of the State Historical Society of\r\nWisconsin. So great was the demand for the book that although 3,500\r\ncopies were printed the edition was exhausted within a brief period.\r\nFor the year 1917 the Indian-captivity narrative of Rev. O. M. Spencer\r\nis being edited by Mr. Quaife. The work was originally written for the\r\n_Western Christian Advocate_ of Cincinnati, from whose files the\r\nnumerous reprint editions in volume form of seventy years ago were\r\ntaken. For the new edition under preparation, recourse has been had to\r\nthe rare file of the _Advocate_ preserved in the newspaper division of\r\nthe Wisconsin Historical Library.\r\n\r\nAn elaborate report of _Perry’s Victory Centennial_ has been issued by\r\nthe Perry’s Victory Centennial Commission, State of New York. As usual\r\nwith politico-historical publications of this character, the\r\nphysiognomies of the several members of the commission are adequately\r\npresented to public gaze in a series of full-page half-tones. The\r\nnumerous historical addresses delivered in connection with the\r\ncelebration constitute the more interesting portion of the contents of\r\nthe volume. Included is the address of Hon. John M. Whitehead of our\r\nSociety at the laying of the cornerstone of the Perry Memorial at\r\nPut-in-Bay, Ohio, July 4, 1913.\r\n\r\nOne of the most laborious, and at the same time useful, pieces of\r\nhistorical workmanship of recent years is being prosecuted towards its\r\nconclusion by Mr. Clarence Brigham, secretary of the American\r\nAntiquarian Society of Worcester, Massachusetts. This is the\r\ncompilation of a calendar of all American newspapers published down to\r\n(and including) the year 1820. Newspapers are as the breath of life to\r\nthe serious student of American history, but with no comprehensive\r\nguide to enlighten him as to what papers were published and where\r\nfiles of these have been preserved, the individual student has been\r\nsadly handicapped heretofore in his efforts to avail himself of this\r\nsource of historical information. Aside from its value to students of\r\nAmerican history generally, there are at least two reasons why the\r\nprogress of Mr. Brigham’s enterprise should afford peculiar interest\r\nto members of this Society; first, because our Society was a pioneer\r\nin the field of publishing newspaper catalogues, the last edition of\r\nour _Annotated Catalogue_ got out by Doctor Thwaites a few years ago\r\nstill standing as one of the two chief American publications of this\r\ncharacter in print; and second, because of the creditable showing made\r\nby our Society’s collection of early American newspapers in Mr.\r\nBrigham’s calendar; this notwithstanding the fact that the major\r\nstrength of our newspaper collection lies in a period more recent than\r\nthat covered by Mr. Brigham.\r\n\r\nPublication of _The Louisiana Historical Quarterly_ was begun by the\r\nLouisiana Historical Society in January, 1917. The initial number\r\ncontains 119 pages of material, bearing chiefly upon the history of\r\nthe state. The Georgia Historical Society issued in March the first\r\nnumber of the _Georgia Historical Quarterly_. These two new\r\npublications afford gratifying evidence of renewed vigor on the part\r\nof their sponsors, each of which is upwards of eighty years of age.\r\n\r\nTo the October, 1916, number of the _Missouri Historical Review_ Duane\r\nMowry of Milwaukee contributes an interesting collection of letters of\r\nCarl Schurz, B. Gratz Brown, and other prominent Missourians,\r\ncontained in the collection of papers of Senator James R. Doolittle of\r\nWisconsin, now in Mr. Mowry’s custody. The January, 1917, number of\r\nthe _Review_ contains a further instalment of Senator Doolittle’s\r\ncorrespondence with leading citizens of Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe June number of the _Mississippi Valley Historical Review_ contains\r\nas a leading article a valuable account of the Doukhobors in Canada.\r\nOther articles worthy of note are Professor Robertson’s “Sectionalism\r\nin Kentucky from 1855 to 1865,” and the annual survey of historical\r\nactivities in the Old Northwest for the preceding year. Our Wisconsin\r\nreaders will be gratified by the opening sentence of the survey: “The\r\nState Historical Society of Wisconsin continues to maintain its\r\nleading position among historical agencies of this region.” To those\r\nof our readers who are as yet unacquainted with the _Review_ we are\r\nglad to commend it as the livest and best historical periodical in\r\nAmerica, saving only the _American Historical Review_. Because it\r\nbelongs to our own section of the country its contents are probably of\r\ngreater interest and value to most middle-western readers than are\r\nthose even of the _American Historical Review_. Membership in the\r\nassociation is open to all; members receive the quarterly _Review_\r\ntogether with the annual volume of _Proceedings_ of the association.\r\n\r\nThe leading articles in the July number of the _American Historical\r\nReview_ possess an unusual degree of timeliness. Prof. S. B. Fay\r\nwrites on “The Beginnings of the Standing Army in Prussia.” Two Civil\r\nWar articles are “The Northern Railroads, April, 1861,” and “The\r\nConfederate Government and the Railroads.” The former of these is by\r\nProf. Carl R. Fish of the University of Wisconsin. Finally, James A.\r\nRobertson, who went from Wisconsin to the librarianship of the Manila\r\nPublic Library, gives an account of “The Philippines since the\r\nInauguration of the Philippine Assembly.” Included in the book reviews\r\nare full-page notices of the two recently issued volumes of this\r\nSociety’s _Collections_, No. XXII and No. XXIII.\r\n\r\nOf military history and principles most Americans are woefully\r\nignorant. Those who would improve their knowledge of these things can\r\nhardly do better than to become readers of _The Military Historian and\r\nEconomist_ edited jointly by Capt. Arthur L. Conger, U. S. A., and\r\nProf. R. M. Johnston of Harvard. Timely and stimulating articles in\r\nthe July number of the magazine are Émile Laloy’s discussion of\r\n“French Military Theory” and an anonymous contributor’s “Estimate of\r\nthe Situation.” The writer believes that the most effective military\r\ncourse for the United States to take is to keep at home the larger\r\npart of the army now in process of creation, and by so doing enable\r\nour navy to be sent into the Pacific to establish there a secure\r\nAnglo-American predominance. The considerations which lead to these\r\nconclusions cannot, of course, be set forth in this brief note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CARL RUSSELL FISH]\r\n\r\n\r\n  VOL.

The historian like the scientist must\r\nbase his knowledge on what can be seen through a microscope.\r\nWisconsin, from the time of its formation as a state, has realized\r\nthis, and has steadily confirmed itself in the opinion. This\r\ninstitution, which it founded in the days of its youth and scant\r\nresources, it has supported with a liberality, public and private,\r\ngrowing as its wealth has grown. Of late years, a corps of local\r\nsocieties, city and county, have been forming about the central\r\ninstitution. The University has directed its students to the study of\r\nthe localities from which they have come, and stores in its stacks the\r\nfacts which they glean. No one of the newer states of the country\r\nknows itself so well as Wisconsin, and if, as is so often the case,\r\nacquired knowledge seems merely to reveal the knowledge still\r\nnecessary for real understanding, we have carefully developed plans to\r\nextend it still more widely and intensively.\r\n\r\nYet how insignificant any locality seems today, when practically all\r\nare plunged into the same calamity, when the resources of all are\r\nconcentrated in one struggle. Races and breeds, nationalities and\r\ncastes are merged together on the same battle-field. Their\r\nsimilarities of plight and object dominate their differences, the\r\nprotective barriers each erected to preserve that distinctiveness so\r\ndear to human nature seem leveled, and history has become world\r\nhistory. Men thrown thus physically into the maelstrom find themselves\r\nintellectually also torn from their safe anchorages and adrift they\r\nknow not where. What does the individual count for, what the locality,\r\nwhat the past? What counts it to study the development of Rock County\r\ncheese-making, when its cheeses and cheese makers are tumbled\r\npromiscuously with those of all counties and nations, simply as units\r\nin a staggering sum total?\r\n\r\nThe world has changed, but that is not startling. The world is always\r\nchanging. This change is greater, and for us in America more sudden\r\nand dramatic, than any which preceded, but everything has not changed.\r\nThe relation of the past to the present and the future is permanent.\r\nThe relations of the individual, the locality, and the whole, shift,\r\nbut they are the permanent factors of which life consists. The world\r\nwar has not changed these factors, but it should bring us up sharply\r\nto a realization of what they really mean. Socrates’ dictum “know\r\nthyself” was not given in any selfish spirit. He did not mean that we\r\nwere to devote ourselves to ourselves, but that we could know\r\nourselves more thoroughly than we could know others, that\r\nself-knowledge was the completest knowledge, and therefore the\r\nArchimedian lever to open up knowledge of others. Self-examination has\r\noften become an obsession excluding all else, the study of local\r\nhistory has often become antiquarianism. The real reason for the\r\ncultivating of both is the formation of known bases from which to\r\ncalculate. The German historian, Lamprecht, became so familiar with\r\nthe little city of Trêves that he could have conversed intimately with\r\nits inhabitants of any year during the Middle Ages if he might have\r\nbeen dropped into it, but this devotion was not for the sake of\r\nTrêves, it gave the understanding knowledge necessary for his great\r\nwork on German civilization as a whole. We can know no generation\r\nunless we have delved deep into the souls of its greatest men, but\r\nsuch biographical studies are not for themselves alone, but to\r\ncontribute to a sympathetic comprehension of their contemporaries.\r\n\r\nLocal history to justify itself must be as exact and absolute as\r\nstudies dealing with human nature may be, but if no effort is made to\r\nutilize it for an understanding of national and world history, it has\r\nmissed its mission. Local history is not an end in itself. Moreover,\r\nif it is written without a wide knowledge of outside conditions,\r\nconditions in other localities, and other times, it will be but a\r\nwarped product, as useless to the community for which it is written as\r\nfor the outside world. Such selfishness and egoism have never been\r\nprofitable. The only difference today is that for the moment at least\r\nthey have become impossible.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature in the history of Wisconsin has been the\r\ntransformation within a lifetime of a virgin forest into a civilized\r\narea, the drawing together of the sons and daughters of many widely\r\ndiffering localities and their welding into a commonwealth. This\r\nconquest of the frontier has been but a portion of that vast movement\r\nwhich in a period historically short has created the United States,\r\nand more particularly it has been an important and typical battle in\r\nthe campaign for the Mississippi Valley, which has resulted in our\r\nsister states of the Middle West.\r\n\r\nDifferent as has been the history of each, the history of the frontier\r\nmovement is a whole; the study of any state contributes to an\r\nunderstanding of all. As the occupation of Wisconsin has been but a\r\npart of the American frontier movement, so that has not been unique,\r\neven in the nineteenth century. We have liked to think of ourselves as\r\ncarrying on a special and distinct task; to its difficulties and\r\ninspiration we have attributed many of our virtues, and on them we\r\nhave laid the burden of our defects. The task, however, has not been\r\nunique. The results have, indeed, had their distinctive differences,\r\nbut these have come rather from the way the task has been performed\r\nthan because we have had a different thing to do. We know our own\r\nfrontier with scientific thoroughness, but we cannot understand it\r\nunless we contrast it with such other frontiers as Australia, Siberia,\r\nSouth America, and Africa.\r\n\r\nOne of the essential features of a frontier is that both labor and\r\ncapital come from without, and much of the capital is contributed by\r\npeople who do not come to the frontier. Exception must, indeed, be\r\nmade to this statement. The Spaniards found labor in Peru and Mexico,\r\nand they found also capital, as did the miners of Australia and\r\nCalifornia, the lumber barons of Wisconsin, and the fur traders of\r\nCanada. In none of these instances, however, did either the local\r\nlabor or local capital suffice, and in all the instances to be cited\r\nlater the bulk of the labor came from away, and the owners of an\r\nimportant portion of the capital remained away; the frontier\r\ncommunity, therefore, was a debtor community, and the debt was due to\r\nan outside community.\r\n\r\nThis common condition has in all cases had an important bearing not\r\nonly on economic development, but on the whole texture of the social\r\nfabric which was created; it affected not only the frontier itself,\r\nbut its reflex influence on the sections from which the labor and\r\ncapital were drawn set at work influences which at times became\r\nleading factors in their existence. So important have their influences\r\nbeen, that where the study is confined to any one frontier, they seem\r\nto dominate development, and make history their creature. When we\r\nextend our study, however, we find that in spite of the fundamental\r\nresemblance, each has followed its separate course; that the different\r\nbalance of other factors, and even such secondary considerations as\r\nlaws and constitutions, have radically altered the actual operation of\r\nthese powerful natural resemblances. The control of the frontier’s\r\nnatural resources, the distribution of proceeds, the very content of\r\npolitics have varied with every frontier. The problem has been one,\r\nthe methods and results have been as varied as the fields in which it\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the larger part of the capital came from or\r\nthrough another section of the same country. That is, the East\r\nfurnished nearly all that was supplied, although to do so it had to\r\nborrow somewhat from Europe. The direct loans from Europe to the West\r\nwere comparatively unimportant. Consequently the interests of the\r\ndebtor and creditor sections conflicted in the arena of national\r\npolitics. Two unique features made the working out of the problem\r\ndifferent in this country from any other. The first was the division\r\nof the country into a large number of states, sovereign within a\r\nrestricted range of powers, some controlled by the debtor element,\r\nsome by the creditor. The other was that at one time, and that the\r\nmost critical, the frontier was strong enough at least to veto the\r\naction of the national government.\r\n\r\nThe result of these conditions was a struggle unusually complex. The\r\ncontrol of banking, of the currency, of natural resources, such as\r\nlands, minerals, and oil, and of transportation or, as it is phrased\r\nin our politics, internal improvements, were the bone of contention.\r\nThe desire to have these controlled by national or state governments\r\nvaried with the political situation. The frontier wished banks that\r\nwould not be too particular, a currency that would be easy to get; it\r\nwished, and wishes, control of its own systems of transportation and\r\nits natural resources.\r\n\r\nThe sections furnishing the supplies were more interested in the\r\ncapital to which strings were tied, than in the labor which cut its\r\napron strings on leaving home. The struggle antedated the Revolution;\r\nthe high points in its later history were the Shays Rebellion, the\r\nJackson régime, the greenback movement, the Bryan campaign, and it\r\nfinds present expression in the opposition in the Far West to the\r\nnational conservation policy.\r\n\r\nWhen the frontier secured the reins of power in the sinewy hands of\r\nAndrew Jackson, it was not in a position to impose its policy upon the\r\nnation, but it was powerful enough to wrest banking, the currency, and\r\ninternal improvements from the control of the national government, and\r\nturn them over to the states. The frontier states, elate, started on a\r\nmad career of making their own internal improvements, by means of\r\nborrowed capital diluted by paper issues, till money ran like fairy\r\ngold into the pockets of the needy. For one golden moment the problem\r\nof the frontier seemed solved to the satisfaction of the frontier.\r\nJackson himself caused the first crash. Unable to tell good paper from\r\nbad, he could at any rate tell paper from gold, and in the Specie\r\nCircular of 1836 he brought credit to the touchstone of real value and\r\nsent the house of cards toppling. Feverishly rebuilt within the next\r\nfew years, it fell again in 1841, carrying with it the whole dream of\r\nits builders. So severe was the blow that numbers of the states took\r\nadvantage of their sovereign rights, and repudiated a portion of their\r\ndebts. Securely entrenched behind their sovereign inviolability to\r\nlegal attack, they still enjoyed the inviolability to force which\r\ntheir position as part of a larger nation afforded. They snapped their\r\nfingers at their creditors; but they could borrow no more. The nation\r\nhad left the task of national development to the states; the states,\r\nby impairing their credit, had rendered themselves incapable of\r\nhandling it.\r\n\r\nThis situation left the field free for, in fact rendered necessary,\r\nthe intervention of individuals or of individuals organized as\r\ncorporations. The legal position of the latter had already been\r\nprepared. The decisions of Justice Marshall had given corporation\r\ncharters an unusual degree of legal sanctity, which the state\r\nconstitutions modified rather than reversed. The fears of the\r\nJeffersonian democracy had incorporated into the national constitution\r\nitself special restrictions upon the government in dealing with the\r\nindividual, which the decisions of the Supreme Court under Justice\r\nTaney went far in applying to the corporations. Corporations became so\r\nfirmly entrenched in their position as the chief agency in national\r\ndevelopment, that even when, after the Civil War, the national\r\ngovernment became more active and once more assumed control of banking\r\nand the currency, and the credit of the states was reëstablished, both\r\nagencies used their powers chiefly to assist corporations. When, in\r\nthe present generation, the necessity of public control became\r\nobvious, it took the form, for the most part, of regulation of\r\ncorporations, rather than that of absorbing or supplanting them.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the development of transportation and the\r\nexploitation of natural resources, therefore, was, for the most part,\r\nin the hands of individuals, and, in the case of large projects, of\r\nindividuals organized as corporations, and, with the exception of farm\r\nland, of individuals and corporations representing nonresident\r\ncapital. Many influences, of course, modified their activities, but\r\nthese affected rather the security of their capital than the\r\ninitiative of their plans. Many lost the capital which they poured\r\ninto the new region, and the result was that the prospect of large\r\nreturns was demanded by others before venturing; speculation, lost\r\ninvestments, and abnormally productive investments characterized the\r\nprocess as a whole. Politicians concerned themselves rather with the\r\nmeans, the questions of banking and currency, than with the end, the\r\ncharacter of the development which should take place.\r\n\r\nThe other independent portions of the American continents, for the\r\nmost part, resembled the United States in organization, but the\r\ndistribution of the economic factors differed and produced different\r\nresults. Except in the United States, the capital which has been\r\nnecessary for the occupation of the wilderness has come, for the most\r\npart, not from other portions of the same country, but from foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these frontiers during the nineteenth century\r\nhas been that of Argentina. Here the established section was until\r\nrecently comparatively unimportant, both labor and capital came in\r\nlarge measure from abroad; the greater portion of the labor from\r\nItaly, of the capital from Great Britain. The conflict between the\r\ndebtor and creditor sections, therefore, was not one of politics, but\r\nof diplomacy. Argentina might have what system of banking and currency\r\nit wished, but most creditors had to be paid in an international\r\nstandard of value. In a world state, doubtless, all the frontiers\r\nwould unite to further their interests, as the frontier states have in\r\nthe United States; in the world as at present unorganized the ultimate\r\nappeal is to force. A debtor country, and one relatively weak as\r\ncompared with its creditor, Argentina has not been without its plans,\r\nconceived like those of the American frontiersman without moral\r\ndishonesty but with incapacity or unwillingness to think the thing\r\nthrough, for easing its burden. In the efforts of Calvo and Drago to\r\nincorporate into international law the principle that debts between\r\nnations and their citizens may not be collected by force, we see as\r\nsurely the reflection of frontier views, as in the programs of\r\nGreenbacker and of Populist. In the greater interest in international\r\naffairs in Argentina than in the United States, we see a new\r\nillustration of the aphorism “For where your treasure is, there will\r\nyour heart be also.”\r\n\r\nIn the long run, Argentina has had to pay up, and has had to pay also\r\nin high interest rates, for the lack of a feeling of absolute security\r\non the part of the investor. Probably few countries have had more\r\nexpensive statesmen than Drago and Calvo.\r\n\r\nTo attract capital, moreover, it has been necessary to offer it\r\nabundantly the undeveloped natural resources of the country. On the\r\nother hand, the logic of the situation has kept development in the\r\nhands of the nation to a greater degree than in the United States, for\r\nthe nation has been able to borrow money more cheaply than individuals\r\nor domestic corporations, and public ownership has played an important\r\npart in her upbuilding.\r\n\r\nArgentina has paid, and so we have a situation which has never\r\nculminated in a crisis. The republics of the Caribbean have not been\r\nso fortunate. Much of the money has been borrowed, not for the\r\npurposes of improvement, but to finance revolution and for personal\r\nexpenditure. Frittered away instead of put at productive work, it has\r\nbecome an increasing burden, in many cases an unbearable burden, and\r\ncountries like Hayti, San Domingo, Honduras, and at times Mexico, have\r\nbecome internationally bankrupt. Protected against legal action by\r\ntheir sovereignty, the creditor and the debtor stood in a situation\r\nwhere force alone could determine their relationship. What the result\r\nwould normally have been, is clearly enough indicated by the\r\nintervention of France in Mexico in 1861, and of Germany in Venezuela\r\nin 1902. The subjugation of the weak debtor by the strong creditor has\r\nbeen prevented not by sovereignty, but by the interposition of a third\r\nforce, the United States inspired by the Monroe Doctrine.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, the Monroe Doctrine served to maintain the appearance\r\nof independence for the nations concerned, it produced an _impasse_ in\r\nthe development of the frontier. Capital did not have to go to\r\ncountries which could not be relied upon to pay up and which were\r\nprotected from foreclosure by an outside force. The United States\r\nserved the republics in somewhat the same manner that it did its own\r\nrepudiating states. It was, however, unable to do as much for them as\r\nit did for its own. The wayward republics found themselves debarred\r\nfrom directing their own development as did our states in the critical\r\nforties, and there was no domestic capital to undertake the task. The\r\ncapital willing to engage in work under such circumstances was that of\r\nthe most speculative sort. Some gamblers staked their money on\r\npresidential contenders, seeking to gain control of the government.\r\nOthers, more powerful and trusting in their power, offered to embark\r\nhuge sums on condition of receiving stupendous grants of the natural\r\nresources and practical control of the whole development to be made in\r\ncertain regions. Such was the much-discussed Morgan syndicate proposal\r\nto Honduras, and that of the English Pearson syndicate to Columbia. In\r\nthe latter instance, the United States again intervened, fearing the\r\ninfluence of such aggregations of foreign capital, and expressed its\r\nopinion that such special concessions violated the spirit of the\r\nMonroe Doctrine and could not be allowed.\r\n\r\nFrom the tightening deadlock thus produced, Diaz extricated Mexico for\r\na time, but it lapsed, and the others showed no signs of the power to\r\nemerge. Such European capital as had been loaned felt not unjustly\r\nangry, such as was for hire sought other avenues and frontiers less\r\npeculiarly hedged in. The situation shouted for action, and action\r\ncould come only from the United States, which would not permit simple\r\nlogic to work its own conclusion. It was under such circumstances that\r\nPresident Roosevelt assumed the financial administration of San\r\nDomingo and inaugurated a policy which has been followed and extended\r\nby his successors. Justice, or approximate justice, has been done\r\nbetween debtor and creditor, but the active development of these\r\nfrontiers is still halted for lack of a machinery for the future.\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast with these American frontiers has been that of\r\nSiberia. Here has taken place one of the greatest frontier advances of\r\nhistory, here the same localization of creditor and debtor has\r\nexisted, yet the conflict of classes and sections has led neither to\r\npolitics as in the United States, nor to diplomacy as in Latin\r\nAmerica. Much of the capital has been provided by France, but the\r\nmoney has, for the most part, been borrowed by the national Russian\r\ngovernment, representing a strong nation and an essential ally. The\r\nsecurity of the creditor has rested in the good faith, not of the\r\nfrontier but of an established society, which has wished constantly\r\nmore and more money and has realized that an atmosphere of credit must\r\nbe preserved.\r\n\r\nAs the frontier has had nothing to say concerning its credit\r\nrelationships, so it has been equally powerless in controlling the\r\nexpenditures of the money borrowed and the disposition of its natural\r\nresources. The sole check upon the absolute will of the central\r\ngovernment has been the desire to attract labor to the frontier. Few\r\nlaborers, as few capitalists, seek the wild for the mere adventure of\r\nsubduing it. The bids and rival bids for settlers by those controlling\r\nvarious sections of the world-frontier for the last three centuries\r\nhave been to a large extent the basis for those more liberal\r\ninstitutions which have developed on the fringe of society. Their bids\r\nhave been determined by the character of the settlers they desired or\r\nfound available, and have in considerable measure determined the\r\ncharacter of the communities built up. Force has played its part as\r\nwell as lure, and has given incurious Africa a share in the\r\ndevelopment of the Americas that the most psychological advertiser\r\nwould never have secured for it. In the nineteenth century, Russia has\r\nhad more command of force to populate her waste spaces than any other\r\ncountry. Consequently the actual frontiersmen have had less to say\r\nabout the development of their own region than elsewhere. Yet it is\r\neasily possible to exaggerate the coercive power of the central\r\ngovernment, in popular estimation it is probably exaggerated; and the\r\nplans for the settlement of Siberia have been to no small degree\r\ninfluenced by consideration for the ideals of the typical Russian and\r\nthe incentives which would coerce him to move his hearthstone. Yet on\r\nthe whole, simplicity and the carrying out of preconceived plans have\r\nworked the opening of this great frontier. That the great release\r\nwhich has just occurred in Russia will reveal where these plans have\r\nbound, and that the politics of the new republic will be colored by\r\nfrontier problems, is inevitable.\r\n\r\nAustralia and New Zealand have, to an even greater extent than the\r\nAmerican frontier, secured their labor and capital from another\r\nsection of the same empire. The relations between the sections,\r\nhowever, are quite different. The local organization of the debtor\r\ncommunities resembles that of the American states; in fact, the scope\r\nof their power is much broader, but they do not possess that\r\ninviolability to legal attack which sovereignty gives, and have not\r\nbeen represented in the central government. Credit, therefore, has\r\nbeen a matter of neither politics nor diplomacy, but has been as\r\nfirmly controlled by the lending section, England, as that of Siberia\r\nhas been by Russia. Judicial unity, which has been the only organic\r\nbond of empire, makes the sovereign, like the Crown, identical in\r\nBrisbane and in London. There is no chance of reducing debts save by a\r\nseparation, which other considerations have rendered furthest from the\r\nwishes of the debtors.\r\n\r\nGeneral diplomacy also has been largely excluded from local\r\nconsideration. The creditor-debtor relationship was almost exclusively\r\none within the empire, and the handling of other diplomatic questions\r\nwas in the hands of the British government in which the frontier\r\nsections were represented only by influence. The attempts to arouse an\r\nimperial, not to say international, mind found hard sledging during\r\nthe real development period, and only partially succeeded just before\r\nthe Great War.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the locality has been absolute master of the\r\nexpenditure of its borrowings. No subordinate communities in the\r\nworld, most decidedly not the states of our Union, have been left so\r\nentirely free to control their development, not only to plan their\r\ntransportation and allot their natural resources, but even to regulate\r\ntheir tariffs. It is not surprising that these governments, with\r\ncredit carefully maintained by outside and unquestionable forces,\r\nfound their politics in the working out of such development, and that,\r\nin large measure, borrowing has been done by the local governments,\r\nwhich have themselves spent the money borrowed. There can be no better\r\nsecurity than that of a government incapacitated from repudiation.\r\nCreditors have lost comparatively little money to these frontiers, and\r\nso Australia and New Zealand have received their needed capital upon\r\nbetter terms, perhaps, than any of the other regions treated. How\r\nwisely they have spent it, is a matter of the most violent dispute.\r\n\r\nPolitics in communities barred from the great questions of credit and\r\ndiplomacy yet organized on the basis of the broadest democracy and\r\nlocal autonomy, have naturally had their strikingly significant\r\ncharacteristics. Everyone knows how rich their statute books have been\r\nin laws relating to the distribution of natural resources and of all\r\nkinds of wealth, and to conditions of living. Everyone knows the sharp\r\nantagonism between labor, in the narrower sense of wage earner, and\r\nemployers. That these frontiers have been experiment grounds in social\r\nlegislation has not been due to their being frontier communities but\r\nbecause they have been frontier communities freed from some of the\r\nmost characteristic frontier problems.\r\n\r\nRhodesia resembles Australia and New Zealand in local autonomy and\r\nlack of representation in the national government. In other respects,\r\nhowever, it is widely different. Here capital came first, and labor\r\nafterward. The capital, moreover, was not of the timid sort seeking\r\nsmall return and security, such as invested in the securities of New\r\nZealand, Victoria, and New South Wales, nor did it entirely resemble\r\nthat of the United States during the development period, which sought\r\nreturns both large and immediate. The capitalists of Rhodesia could\r\nwait, in fact, are still waiting. Alone among the frontiers, Rhodesia\r\nhas not been under the strain of seeking to make returns on its\r\ninvested capital before development has reached the stage where\r\nreturns can properly be expected. It may well hope to be freed from\r\nthose complications of individual indebtedness, which have filled our\r\ncourts with business, and strewn our advance with such tragedies as\r\nare even today occurring in northern Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nUpon the capitalists thus far-sighted and enduring rested the full\r\nburden of development. The region was autonomous in its relation to\r\nthe British Empire, but its non-resident creditors mapped out its\r\nfuture, not its settlers as in Australia. Capital under such\r\ncircumstances looks for large rewards, and in this case expects to\r\nsecure them by control of the natural resources, when these have been\r\nmade available by the incoming of settlers. Youngest of the frontiers,\r\nthe working of the old factors in this new relationship remains a\r\nquestion. One would expect economy and efficiency in planning, but\r\npossible conflicts between the resident community and its creditors\r\nover the division of the proceeds. The settlers that it seeks are of\r\nthe most independent type, men not with energy alone, but with some\r\nsmall capital of their own. It offers them not only economic\r\nopportunity but also political privileges. How such a population will\r\nreact under a system which restricts politics one degree more than\r\nthey are restricted in Australia, by excluding the larger lines of\r\nlocal development such as transportation, is one of the interesting\r\nquestions of tomorrow. One might look for some clue in the history of\r\nthe American colonial proprietorships, but how far the intelligent\r\nstudy of those experiments will have enabled the proprietors of\r\nRhodesia to avoid their mistakes, and how far the changed conditions\r\ncreated by two centuries of the most rapid change the world has seen,\r\nwill modify the interworking of similar forces, no one can tell.\r\n\r\nIn organization, Canada is today, of course, like Australia, but\r\nwhereas the commonwealth of Australia is but recent and was formed\r\nonly after the scaffolding of development had been created, the\r\nDominion of Canada was created in season to direct the most active\r\nperiod of frontiering. During the most significant period, therefore,\r\nCanada has had an organization that resembled our federal states. The\r\nresemblance, however, is partly superficial; in Canada the specified\r\npowers belong to the provinces, the undefined powers to the Dominion.\r\nNeither provinces nor Dominion, moreover, have possessed the legal\r\ninviolability of absolute sovereignty. The credit of all has been\r\nprotected by the judicial unity of the empire, and the stability of\r\nthe currency has not been a subject for politics. Diplomacy, also, has\r\nbelonged to the mother country, although the proximity of the United\r\nStates has not allowed it to be the blank it was so long in its\r\nAustralian sister-colonies.\r\n\r\nEconomically the development of the Canadian frontier has more\r\nresembled that of the United States, for the capital required has come\r\nmost largely from or through other sections of the same colony. As\r\ncompared with the United States, however, development has been, until\r\nquite lately, slow. Consequently those regions which have passed\r\nbeyond the frontier stage have continuously controlled the central\r\ngovernment. There has been no parallel to the Jackson régime. Credit,\r\ntherefore, has been doubly guarded, by the majority in Canada, and by\r\nCanada’s position within the British Empire. With the credit of the\r\nDominion and of the provinces intact, there have been no intrinsic\r\nobstacles to the development of transportation and the control of\r\nresources by the public, and public works have played an important\r\npart. At the same time the period of greatest need coincided with the\r\nhigh tide of the individualistic movement in the Anglo-Saxon world.\r\nThe principles of John Stuart Mill, of Cobbett and Bright, of\r\nGladstone, Carlyle, and Emerson, dominated a generation devoted to the\r\ntask of breaking down time-worn systems of social control and\r\nreleasing the individual. The period of new regulations dictated by\r\nrising democracy had not swung in. Therefore, a very considerable\r\nportion of the task was left to private corporations, to whom were\r\ngranted very considerable proportions of the natural resources.\r\nCorporation control and public enterprise, therefore, combined with\r\nunusual harmony in developing and exploiting a frontier which was,\r\nindeed, represented, but which could control in neither a positive nor\r\na negative sense.\r\n\r\nThe recent and sudden expansion of the Canadian frontier in the west\r\nand northwest has created a new balance. The situation in Canada today\r\nresembles that in the United States when the advance of population\r\nfrom the Alleghanies to beyond the Mississippi gave the frontier an\r\nunusual political weight, and elected Andrew Jackson. This region is\r\njust now in the position where it is so eager to get capital that it\r\nis ready to agree to almost any terms to secure its railroads and farm\r\nmachinery. When pay time comes, its sentiments will change. It is\r\ndifficult to see how it can upset credit, but that, in combination\r\nwith the democracy of the older portions of Canada, it will make its\r\nvoice felt and play a part in Canadian politics that the frontier has\r\nnever played in the long course of Canadian history, no student of\r\nfrontiers can doubt.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Canada has secured its capital at low interest rates,\r\nlower probably than any other frontier except Australia and New\r\nZealand. It has, however, sacrificed the control of its natural\r\nresources to a considerable degree. The direction of its development\r\nhas attracted both public attention and the labor of its strongest men\r\ncontrolling private capital. In none of the frontiers have the two\r\nsystems been so equally blended.\r\n\r\nMost hapless of the frontiers is that of Manchuria. It is at present a\r\nrepresented province of an imperial republic, which furnishes most of\r\nthe labor required, but can furnish neither capital nor protection.\r\nIts capital comes, for the most part, from two rival foreign powers,\r\nwho are not really creditor nations, but who are so eager to invest in\r\nManchuria that they borrow from still other countries for the purpose.\r\nThe local community has no more to say in regard to its development or\r\nthe partition of its resources than Siberia. It does not, indeed, rest\r\nunder any such obligation of paying as does Australia, for power\r\nrather than money return is sought by Russia and Japan, who furnish it\r\nwith money on their own security and, therefore, at reasonably low\r\nrates. Undoubtedly, however, the successful grasp of power will mean\r\nsuch a hold on natural resources as will give those countries, in\r\nreturn for their guarantee, rewards which will be more satisfactory to\r\nthem than to the actual conquerors of the Manchurian wilds. It will be\r\ninteresting to see whether sectional interests will unite the Russian\r\nand Japanese settlers with the Chinese majority against the foreign\r\ncapitalists, or whether racial antagonism will prove stronger than\r\neconomic. Countless cross currents already chop the surface, and\r\nconditions point rather to a problem than a state.\r\n\r\nWide as is the field covered by the frontiers discussed, the\r\nMississippi Valley, Argentina, the wilds encircling the Caribbean,\r\nSiberia, Australia, Canada, and Manchuria, it covers barely half the\r\narea where since the year 1800 European civilization has been\r\nstruggling to establish itself by the occupation of regions wholly or\r\npartly vacant. Different as have been the conditions classified under\r\nwhich the simple underlying factors universally involved have\r\noperated, more have been left undescribed. Algiers has had a frontier\r\nincorporated as an integral part of France, a centralized republic. In\r\nfact, practically every region of Africa has presented a frontier, and\r\nthe handling of frontier conditions by English, French, and Belgians,\r\nBoers, Germans, Portuguese, Italians, Spaniards, and American negroes.\r\nThe greatest frontier area today is Brazil, and every country of Latin\r\nAmerica has a frontier and its own slightly varying organization and\r\nbalance of forces, while the British, French, and Dutch are all\r\nseverally trying their hand on the particular problem of a tropical\r\nAmerican frontier. Some portions of India, Persia, Arabia, Indo-China,\r\nChina, Korea, the Philippines, Formosa, and many South Sea Islands,\r\npresent the problem under special guises. Sweden, Norway, Russia,\r\nCanada, and the United States are all dealing with the possibility of\r\npressing civilization into the fastnesses of the Arctic.\r\n\r\nWhen one considers the extent of the world frontier in process of\r\noccupation during the last century, the persuasive effect of its call\r\nupon the older world for labor and capital, the coloring of the whole\r\nworld by the natural resources it has unearthed and the institutions\r\nit has developed, its conquest can hardly be considered as second in\r\ninfluence to any factor of the time. Naturally it is not intended to\r\npresent here even a basis for its study. The fundamental factors and\r\nthe different systems can be accurately enough described in general\r\nterms, but the differences in their operation are less precise than\r\nhas been indicated; private corporations exist in Siberia, state\r\npublic improvements in the United States. Many of the similarities\r\nproduced everywhere by frontier conditions have been neglected. The\r\nattempt has been merely to indicate some of the tendencies fostered by\r\ndifferent types of control. The differences between the various\r\nfrontiers, resulting from race and geography, which in many cases\r\nexplain the different types of organization or modify their working,\r\nhave been left untouched. The problem is immense, its study is one for\r\ngenerations. Yet some things he who runs may read. Even a partial\r\nacquaintance with the main features of all cannot but render the work\r\nof each statesman and historian more effective in his own particular\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nSome things will be understood only when no frontier, as we know it,\r\nexists. Yet even while we are in the current, we have accumulated some\r\nmaterial, and it would seem to be contributory negligence not to use\r\nit. It must be patent that one must be honest or must pay for it. Can\r\nwe not secure some rough idea of which system of approach has resulted\r\nin the greater justice between the creditor and debtor section, and\r\nwhat is justice? Has community control of its development or creditor\r\ncontrol been most economical and most effective? Has exploitation to\r\nproduce local capital any justification? What system has called to the\r\ntask the greater proportion of ability? Would the United States have\r\nfared better under a system by which Webster, Clay, and Calhoun would\r\nhave devoted to moulding the transportation system the genius they\r\nspent in bolstering up public credit? Which system has been the most\r\nresponsive to the needs of the situation, and which has stimulated the\r\ngreatest amount of public virtue, and which has been most easily\r\nmanipulated for selfish advantage?\r\n\r\nI haven’t the slightest intention of answering these questions here; I\r\nfreely admit that many of them leave me perplexed, but I dogmatically\r\nmaintain that it is by pondering such questions, by studying the\r\ncomparisons they suggest, that the frontier problem is to be\r\nunderstood by the historian and comprehended by the statesman. Without\r\nsuch comparisons the student of the problem in any one field is less\r\napt to judge a particular episode rightly than a man with no knowledge\r\nand good intentions. The path to wisdom and sure-footed action must be\r\nfounded on the rock of exact knowledge, but it must be platted on a\r\nwide-spread survey.\r\n\r\nAll life reveals the irony of wisdom attained only by the experience\r\nto deal with which it was needed. It is but today we have this rich\r\nstorehouse of experimental frontier building, and tomorrow we will\r\nhave no frontier. It might seem that we could let a dead past bury its\r\ndead, that the study of frontier episodes, however successful, has\r\nbecome sheer antiquarianism. Such a view, however, minimizes the world\r\nfrontier that remains and the time and effort that will be required in\r\nits conquest. As in science, so with the material world, the\r\nnineteenth century made easy sweeping advances; it left much that was\r\ndifficult for the slower and more laborious labors of the twentieth.\r\nIt overlooks the facts that great masses of the world’s inhabitants\r\ntoday count the experience of meeting the wild first-hand among the\r\nmost important of their nearby inheritances, that the frontier set its\r\nmark upon them or their parents, or grandparents, and that the present\r\ngeneration cannot be understood unless the frontier is understood.\r\nStill more important is the consideration that in many instances the\r\nfrontier merely localizes problems that are general. The factors with\r\nwhich this paper has dealt are peculiar to the frontier only in that\r\nthe creditors are assembled in one section, the debtors in another.\r\nThis is an important peculiarity in large part because it isolates the\r\ncharacteristics of each, and makes them easier of study. When the\r\nworld has been fully occupied, new frontiers will appear, are already\r\nappearing. Natural resources now undreamed of will need capital and\r\nlabor for their exploitation, will be susceptible of development in\r\nmore than one way, and will raise problems of control. Our experiences\r\nwith the rude and simple problem of the first occupation of a waste\r\narea will seem as geometry to calculus compared with those raised by\r\nthese new frontiers, but will be as essential to a wise handling of\r\nthem as geometry is to calculus.\r\n\r\nBut the instances that we have reviewed seem to carry a simpler and\r\nmore immediate moral. When we see in the United States people of all\r\nnations laboring for the conquest of the Mississippi Valley, and\r\nemploying money saved by New England and the Middle States or borrowed\r\nby them from Europe, when we see Russia borrowing French money to make\r\nSiberia habitable for Russian peasants, when Japan borrows in England,\r\nand Russia in France to pay Chinese to develop transportation in\r\nManchuria, when Argentina borrows English money to employ Italians in\r\nthe pampas, and Transvaal gold passes through English banks to build\r\nRhodesian railways, we get glimpses of a new world. Not that these\r\nthings are absolutely novel, but that in variety and extent they are\r\nunparalleled, and these experiences on the frontiers but bring into\r\nclearer view general tendencies of the time. The German invasion of\r\nBelgium uncovered for most of us the tens of thousands of Russians\r\nworking in the Liege factories, the hundreds of thousands of Russians\r\nworking on German farms, of Italians on the Rhine, of Spaniards in\r\nFrance; the war itself has hastened the movement with its vast\r\nimportations of Indo-Chinese and Arabs into France, with its\r\ntight-woven mesh of international credit. The frontier still reveals\r\nmost clearly how in the nineteenth century the business of life became\r\ninternational and how poorly devised was the world organization for\r\ncoping with it.\r\n\r\nAgain, the experience of the frontier in the nineteenth century\r\nexhibits one step in the process of readjustment. Can one review the\r\ninstances which have been noted, without feeling the theory of\r\nabsolute sovereignty crumbling beneath his feet? The United States has\r\nin practice divided the sovereignty, and as a result surrendered the\r\nactual control to corporations they themselves created. The British\r\nEmpire preserved unity in theory, but actually divided it still more\r\neffectually. What can a practical man make of the sovereignty of\r\nHonduras, where the native government cannot control its own\r\ndevelopment, the British Empire cannot protect its citizens’ money,\r\nand the United States can veto the actions of both but cannot take\r\npositive action; or of Manchuria, which is an integral portion of a\r\nsovereign republic, but which is actually as to one-half controlled by\r\nRussia and the other by Japan, both of whom are somewhat curtailed in\r\ntheir actions by promises to the United States. However one may cling\r\nto the legal theory of the absolute and indivisible character of\r\nsovereignty in independent localities, a study of the world frontier\r\nbrings out the fact that no localities are independent in fact, or\r\nabsolutely sovereign. The inter-growth of the world, which the\r\ndevelopment of the world frontier has so much facilitated, has already\r\nweakened the bulwarks of local independence; let us hope that with its\r\ninternational character the frontier may facilitate the integration of\r\na world organization better adapted to the conditions of today, such\r\nan organization as tomorrow will be a necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [82] Delivered as the annual address before the State\r\n     Historical Society of Wisconsin October 25, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY RECOLLECTIONS OF LAKE GENEVA (BIG FOOT LAKE), WISCONSIN\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE MANIERRE[83]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy grandfather, William Reid, came to Chicago in 1840. At that time,\r\nalthough a mere village of 4,479 inhabitants, it was in the midst of a\r\nspeculative fever and was even then speaking of its certain future\r\ngreatness and of Lake Geneva (Big Foot Lake) as a probable summer\r\nresort for its citizens. My grandfather came of a well-known family\r\nwhose ancestor with his tenants fought at the battle of Bothwell\r\nBridge, June 22, 1679, under the flag “For God, King, and Covenant,”\r\nand who inherited through him the estate of Kilbryd, situated near\r\nGlasgow, Scotland. William Reid inherited wealth which he, as a\r\nbarrister, increased, so that at about middle life he made up his mind\r\nto retire. Unfortunately for his family his investments proved\r\nunsuccessful, and after the loss of the greater part of his fortune he\r\ncame to America and started anew. When he came to Chicago he had a\r\nrelatively large sum of money, which, if invested in Chicago, might\r\neventually have increased to great wealth; but he was stricken by the\r\nLake Geneva fever and went there with his family, locating at the head\r\nof the lake. He invested largely in land by the lake and on Big Foot\r\nPrairie, buying a large tract of land on the higher ground and about\r\nseventy acres along the lake.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HOUSE OF WILLIAM REID AT THE HEAD OF LAKE GENEVA\r\n  From a water color in the Wisconsin Historical Library painted in\r\n  1842 by Mrs. James Drew]\r\n\r\nMy grandmother, Mary Drew, came of a cultivated family which was\r\ndistantly related to the family of the Duke of Hamilton. Her niece was\r\nthe first wife of William Gladstone, the English statesman. Mention is\r\nmade of these things to show the change from the ease of their former\r\nmode of living to the vicissitudes which locating on the frontier\r\nentailed.\r\n\r\nMy grandparents had nine children, five boys and four girls, part of\r\nwhom were born in the log house at the head of the lake. This house\r\nstood about two hundred feet from shore at the bottom of a rise of\r\nground known as the Potawatomi Indian burial ground, upon which site\r\nthe electric railway depot now stands. I remember as a boy digging\r\nIndian relics out of this hill. The house was neatly built of logs and\r\nhad two large wings; in the center of one room was a fireplace\r\nsuitable for burning large logs. Among the early settlers in the\r\nneighborhood at this time who had land and houses at the head of the\r\nlake were the Van Slykes,[84] the Mohrs,[85] the Russells,[86] and the\r\nDouglasses.[87]\r\n\r\nHere the children grew up with the ordinary opportunities of farmers’\r\nchildren and had no better advantages; and years later my cousin,\r\nJessie (Reid) Donaldson, my brother, Will, and I used to come here to\r\nenjoy the beautiful surroundings of grandfather’s place. Will and I\r\nhad a little pony called Jenny and a wagon which we used to drive to\r\nThe Corners for mail. Whenever Jenny wanted to go into the barn or\r\nwhenever we took her to the blacksmith’s to be shod, she had a funny\r\ntrick of rapping on the door with her feet.\r\n\r\nI remember the Baptist people used frequently to come down to the lake\r\nin front of my grandfather’s house, and that the minister would there\r\nduck the women under the water, according to their custom. My aunt,\r\nwith great sympathy, would lead the women into the house, where they\r\ncould change their clothes.\r\n\r\nSouth of the house, where a stream ran through the inlet into the\r\nlake, was a marsh, in the center of which was an island. Here in those\r\nearly days deer were often to be seen. Prairie chickens were plentiful\r\non Big Foot Prairie, and in the spring wild pigeons, now extinct, flew\r\nover it in countless numbers. Woodcock, ruffed grouse, and squirrels\r\nwere also numerous. In the lake there was a large quantity of game\r\nfish, among which were the cisco. These were seen only during the last\r\ndays of May or the early days of June when they came from the depths\r\nof the lake to the shallow water to feed on the May flies and to\r\nspawn. Of the wild life existing at that time, only a fraction now\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nMatthias Mohr owned the old sawmill on the rising ground at the south\r\nend of the marsh. The race was fed by a large brook that emptied into\r\nthe marsh. This beautiful spot, surrounded by bushes and trees, was\r\noften visited by me. The old wheel was still, but it was pleasant to\r\nlisten to the sound of the clear, cold water of the brook as it rushed\r\nover the dismantled wheel to its outlet in the marsh. This brook was\r\nafterward dammed up and used for raising brook trout.\r\n\r\nNumerous beautiful springs were to be found running from the higher\r\nground to the lake. About half a mile north of the house was a small\r\nschoolhouse where I remember being spelled down by a little girl. The\r\nhouse was afterward occupied by an English laborer by the name of\r\nBlackwell, and I have his son Bill in pleasant remembrance. The road\r\npast the schoolhouse at the foot of a high bluff ran south by\r\nDouglass’ Mill and north to the farm belonging to my grandfather. From\r\nDouglass’ Mill,[88] which was built by C. L. Douglass and first used\r\nas a sawmill and then as a gristmill, we used to go on up a very steep\r\nhill to the road going west to The Corners, about three miles from my\r\ngrandfather’s house, where at that early day the mail was obtained.\r\nThe village located where the mill once stood has since been called\r\nFontana.[89]\r\n\r\nLater we went to Walworth for the mail, taking the road running south.\r\nThe town of Walworth was founded in 1836 by James Van Slyke who made\r\nhis residence at the head of the lake. The only residents there about\r\n1840 were Christopher Douglass and sons, Marcus Russell, James Van\r\nSlyke, Matthias Mohr, and William Reid. Matthias Mohr purchased 50\r\nacres in the town of Walworth in 1840, and in 1843 he purchased 38\r\nacres more. In 1840 William Reid purchased 960¼ acres, in 1840 Marcus\r\nRussell purchased 80 acres, and in 1841, Christopher Douglass\r\npurchased 480 acres, all in the town of Walworth.\r\n\r\nThe village of Walworth had a store, a blacksmith shop, the Red Lion\r\nHotel, and the Brick Church. In the Brick Church cemetery are buried\r\ntoday the remains of my grandfather and my grandmother and a number of\r\ntheir children. The Red Lion Hotel was used by many people passing on\r\nthe main road from town to town in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nA short distance to the north of grandfather’s house was the sugar\r\nbush. This was at the bottom of the high hills going north up to\r\nRussell’s. Near the place stood the old Potawatomi village and\r\ncornfields which Mrs. Kinzie in her book _Wau Bun_ speaks of visiting\r\nin 1831.[90] I well remember seeing the Indian trail back of the house\r\nleading up to the higher land in the sugar bush.\r\n\r\nThe country at the head of the lake was filled with large butternut,\r\nwalnut, hickory, basswood, ash, sugar maple, white-, black-, and\r\nburr-oak trees. The sugar bush, through which a clear, cold brook ran\r\nmurmuring to its outlet in the lake, was notable for its many\r\nbutternut trees and was one of the most beautiful spots that could be\r\nseen anywhere about the lake. I remember well the large oak tree near\r\nmy grandfather’s house in which a canoe had been placed holding the\r\nremains of a relative[91] of Big Foot,[92] an Indian chief after whom\r\nBig Foot Prairie was named. The wood of the softer trees near the farm\r\nwas used by the Reid family for the rails from which snake fences were\r\nmade. I remember my father and driver taking stakes from a snake fence\r\nand putting them in the mud for my mother to stand on.\r\n\r\nIn the early days my father and mother in going to Lake Geneva had to\r\ngo by wagon. When the railroads were built, they took a train to\r\nTurner Junction (now West Chicago) located thirty miles west of\r\nChicago, and from there took a wagon to Lake Geneva. Later they went\r\nby the same railroad (the Northwestern) to Harvard Junction and from\r\nthere by wagon to the head of the lake.\r\n\r\nAt Harvard was located a hotel owned by Elbridge G. Ayer,[93] the\r\nfather of Edward E. Ayer of this city. This hotel was a few feet from\r\nthe track and its dining-room furnished meals to the people traveling\r\non that road. This dining-room was known all over the West, for at\r\nthat time there was no other that could compete with it. All the\r\nvegetables, meat, poultry, and pastry were cooked in the most\r\nappetizing manner and the products furnished for the table came fresh\r\nfrom Mr. Ayer’s farm. My father and mother, my brother Will, and I\r\nhave often taken meals at this hotel on our way from the Junction to\r\nthe lake. The village of Harvard was afterward beautified by Mr.\r\nAyer’s son, Edward E. Ayer, who planted fourteen hundred trees about\r\nit. Most of these are standing today and are an evidence of the public\r\nspirit of the donor, which is seen in Chicago in his activities in\r\nbehalf of the Newberry Library, Field Museum, and other\r\ninstitutions.[94]\r\n\r\nMy grandmother’s brother, James Drew, a wealthy barrister from London,\r\nEngland, and his wife visited his sister at the head of the lake in\r\n1842. At this time Mrs. Drew made a small water-color drawing of the\r\nhouse and its vicinity which has recently been placed in the Wisconsin\r\nHistorical Library.\r\n\r\nMy recollections of Geneva go back to the early fifties. I can\r\nremember going with my uncle in a rowboat from the head to the foot of\r\nthe lake, some eight miles. At that time there were no steamboats on\r\nthe lake and an unbroken forest covered its shores. The high ground\r\nbordering the lake was about 175 feet above the beach line. The depth\r\nof the lake has since been found to be from 80 to 181 feet. The lake\r\nis eight miles long and from one to two miles wide. It empties into\r\nthe Fox River by a deep creek at the east end.\r\n\r\nMy mother, Ann Hamilton Reid, daughter of William Reid, was born in\r\nGlasgow, Scotland, October 23, 1823. She was married to my father,\r\nGeorge Manierre, after whom I was named, in Detroit in 1842.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [83] The author’s reminiscences of the Manierre family have\r\n     been printed in Volume 8 Number 3 of the Illinois State\r\n     Historical Society _Publications_.\r\n\r\n     [84] James Van Slyke made the first settlement near the\r\n     Potawatomi Indian village in that place which later became\r\n     the town of Walworth. He built a cabin and moved his family\r\n     there from Geneva in the fall of 1836. Mrs. Van Slyke is\r\n     supposed to have been the only white woman who spent that\r\n     winter there. Many stories are told of the courage she\r\n     displayed in this frontier community.\r\n\r\n     [85] Matthias Mohr was one of the earliest residents of\r\n     Walworth County, settling on part of the Van Slyke claim at\r\n     the head of Lake Geneva in 1837. He later went to Kansas\r\n     where he died in 1887. Glenwood Springs Park now stands on\r\n     the site of his farm.\r\n\r\n     [86] Marcus and Robert Russell settled at the west end of\r\n     Lake Geneva in 1837. Robert Russell later moved to Iowa.\r\n     Marcus Russell died in 1875.\r\n\r\n     [87] Christopher Douglass was born in Connecticut in 1797\r\n     and moved to Wisconsin in 1837, settling on Big Foot\r\n     Prairie. In 1842 he moved to the town of Walworth, where he\r\n     kept a hotel for several years. In 1857 he took up his\r\n     residence at the head of Lake Geneva where he died in 1866.\r\n\r\n     [88] C. L. Douglass, son of Christopher Douglass, was born\r\n     in New York November 4, 1827, and came to Wisconsin with his\r\n     father in 1837. In 1857 he built and equipped Big Foot Mills\r\n     which he continued to operate for thirty years. He died\r\n     January 6, 1898.\r\n\r\n     [89] Fontana, a summer resort at the head of Lake Geneva,\r\n     covers the site of the old Potawatomi village and is part of\r\n     the old Van Slyke claim. It was purchased of Van Slyke in\r\n     1838 by Matthias Mohr, Amos Bailey, and Dr. Henry Clark, who\r\n     platted and named the village.\r\n\r\n     [90] Mrs. John H. Kinzie, _Wau Bun, the early day in the\r\n     North-west_ (New York, 1856), 318-22. Mrs. Kinzie in company\r\n     with her husband, U. S. sub-Indian agent at Fort Winnebago,\r\n     was making the trip from Chicago to Fort Winnebago (Portage)\r\n     in 1831 when she visited Big Foot’s village. She describes\r\n     the chief as a “large, rawboned, ugly Indian with a\r\n     countenance bloated by intemperance, and with a sinister,\r\n     unpleasant expression.”\r\n\r\n     [91] This was Big Foot’s son, who died about 1830. The body\r\n     was encased in a rude coffin and fastened to the limbs of a\r\n     tree overlooking the lake. Big Foot is said to have given as\r\n     his reason for this mode of burial that his son had been\r\n     unusually fond of lake scenery, and he would thus enjoy a\r\n     fine view of it from the land to which he had gone.\r\n\r\n     [92] Big Foot was the last chief of his band to rule his\r\n     people in their own land. In 1827, when the Winnebago were\r\n     on the war path, Big Foot, a sturdy hater of the whites,\r\n     tried to incite the Potawatomi to join the northern Indians.\r\n     He was prevented by measures taken by Gov. Lewis Cass which\r\n     culminated in the treaty of September 15, 1827. Being bound\r\n     by former treaties, Big Foot remained neutral during the\r\n     Black Hawk War. By the treaty of 1832 the territory of the\r\n     Potawatomi and their allies, the Chippewa and the Ottawa,\r\n     comprising southeastern Wisconsin, passed to the United\r\n     States government. Big Foot refused to sign the treaty until\r\n     the other chiefs had done so.\r\n\r\n     [93] Elbridge Gerry Ayer, born in Haverhill, Mass., July 25,\r\n     1813, came to Wisconsin in 1836. In 1847 he moved to\r\n     Walworth, going from there to McHenry County, Ill. in 1857,\r\n     where he founded the town of Harvard. There for eighteen\r\n     years he and his wife conducted one of the best hotels in\r\n     the state. During the Civil War they gave without pay food,\r\n     lodging, and other assistance to the wounded Union soldiers\r\n     detained in that vicinity. On the occasion of their golden\r\n     wedding in 1885 Gov. James Lewis of Wisconsin, on behalf of\r\n     the Wisconsin soldiers, presented to Mr. and Mrs. Ayer a\r\n     gold cup, now in the museum of the Wisconsin Historical\r\n     Society. The inscription is as follows: “Presented to Mr.\r\n     and Mrs. E. G. Ayer by the Wisconsin soldiers as a token of\r\n     remembrance and appreciation of the many acts of kindness\r\n     toward them during the dark days of the Rebellion, from 1861\r\n     to 1865, Oct. 29, 1885.”\r\n\r\n     [94] Edward Everett Ayer, of Chicago, son of Mr. and Mrs.\r\n     Elbridge G. Ayer, has long been connected with enterprises\r\n     relating to arts and letters. He is a director of the\r\n     Newberry Library, of the Field Museum, and of the Art\r\n     Institute. He himself has one of the finest private\r\n     libraries in the United States which contains manuscripts\r\n     relating to the early history of North America, the Indians,\r\n     Mexico, the West Indies, and the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF A JOURNEY TO NORTH AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\nBY RASMUS B. ANDERSON\r\n\r\nI have been asked to prepare a brief introduction for Ole Nattestad’s\r\ndescription of his journey from Norway to America in 1837. In\r\ncomplying with this request I shall make free use of facts and\r\nstatements published by me in various other works and particularly in\r\nmy _First Chapter of Norwegian Immigration_ (1906).\r\n\r\nThe Norsemen have an honorable place in the annals of America. We may,\r\nindeed, say that the civilized history of this country begins with the\r\nNorsemen. If you look at a map you will at once find that Greenland\r\nand even a part of Iceland belong to the western hemisphere, and\r\nIceland became the hinge upon which the door swings that opens America\r\nto Europe. It was the occupation of Iceland by the Norsemen in the\r\nyear 874 and the frequent voyages between this island and Norway that\r\nled to the discovery and settlement first of Greenland and then of\r\nAmerica, and it is due to the culture and fine historical taste of the\r\nIcelanders that carefully prepared records of these Norse voyages were\r\nkept, first to teach pelagic navigation to Columbus and afterwards to\r\nsolve for us the mysteries concerning the first discovery of this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThe old republican Vikings well understood the importance of studying\r\nthe art of ship-building and of navigation. They knew how to measure\r\ntime by the stars and how to calculate the course of the sun and moon.\r\nThey were themselves pioneers in venturing out upon the high seas and\r\ntaught the rest of the world to navigate the ocean. Every scrap of\r\nwritten history sustains me when I say that the other peoples of the\r\nworld were limited in their nautical knowledge to coast navigation.\r\nThe Norse Vikings who crossed the stormy North Sea, finding their way\r\nto Great Britain, to the Orkneys, the Faröes, and to Iceland, all\r\nthose heroes who found their way to Greenland and Vinland, taught the\r\nworld pelagic navigation. They demonstrated the possibility of\r\nventuring out of sight of land, and in this sense, if in no other, we\r\nmay with perfect propriety assert that the Norsemen taught Columbus\r\nhow to cross the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThat the Norsemen held an honorable place in the annals of America is\r\nshown by a fact of the greatest importance in the world’s history,\r\nnamely, that the Norsemen anticipated by five centuries Christopher\r\nColumbus and Amerigo Vespucius and the new world was discovered by\r\nLeif Erikson in the year 1000. About the year 860 the Norsemen\r\ndiscovered Iceland and soon afterwards (in 874) they established upon\r\nthis island a republic which flourished for 400 years. Greenland was\r\nseen for the first time in 876 by Gunnbjorn Ulfson from Norway. About\r\na century later, in the year 984, Erik the Red resolved to go in\r\nsearch of the lands in the west which Gunnbjorn as well as others\r\nlater had seen. He sailed from Iceland, and found a land as he had\r\nexpected, and remained there exploring the country for two years. At\r\nthe end of this period he returned to Iceland, giving the\r\nnewly-discovered country the name of Greenland in order, as he said,\r\nto attract settlers who would be favorably impressed with so pleasing\r\na name. Thus, as Greenland belongs geographically wholly to America,\r\nit will be seen that Erik the Red was the first white man to boom\r\nAmerican real estate. And he was successful. Many Norsemen emigrated,\r\nparticularly from Iceland, and a flourishing colony with Gardar as its\r\ncapital and Erik the Red as its first governor was established and\r\nbecame the first settlement of Europeans in the new world. In the year\r\n1261 it became subject to the crown of Norway. We have a list of\r\nseventeen bishops who served in Greenland. Erik the Red and his\r\nfollowers were not Christian when they settled in Greenland, but\r\nworshippers of Odin and Thor, though they relied chiefly on their own\r\nmight and strength. Christianity was introduced among them about the\r\nyear 1000, though Erik the Red continued to adhere to the religion of\r\nhis fathers to his dying day.\r\n\r\nThe first white man whose eyes beheld any part of the American\r\ncontinent was the Norseman, Bjarne Herjulfson, who saw this land in\r\nthe year 986. The first white man who, to our knowledge, planted his\r\nfeet on the soil of the American continent was Leif Erikson, the son\r\nof Erik the Red, in the year 1000; and Leif’s brother Thorvald, who\r\ndied in 1002, was the first white man and the first Christian who was\r\nburied beneath American sod. Thorfin Karlsefne, who landed in 1007,\r\nwas the first white man to found a settlement within the limits of the\r\npresent United States, and his wife, Gudrid, was the first white woman\r\nwho came to Vinland. In the year 1008 she gave birth to a son in\r\nVinland. The boy, who received in baptism the name Snorre, was the\r\nfirst person of European descent born in the new world. In 1112 Erik\r\nUpsi settled as bishop in Greenland and in 1121 this same bishop went\r\non a missionary journey from Greenland to Vinland, the first visit of\r\na Christian minister to the American continent. The last of these\r\ninteresting voyages before the rediscovery of America by Columbus was\r\nin the year 1347 when a Greenland ship with a crew of eighteen men\r\ncame from Nova Scotia (Markland) to Straumfjord in Iceland. Thus it\r\nappears that the Vinland voyages extended over a period of about 350\r\nyears and to within 145 years of the rediscovery of America by\r\nColumbus in 1492. From the accounts of these voyages and settlements\r\nwe get our first knowledge and descriptions of the aborigines of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nWhile Leif Erikson was the first white man to plant his feet on the\r\neastern shores of the American continent, it was left to another\r\nplucky Scandinavian to become the discoverer of the narrow body of\r\nwater which separates America from Asia. Vitus Bering was a Dane born\r\nin Jutland, in Denmark, in 1680. He entered the service of Russia and\r\nin 1725 was made commander-in-chief of one of the greatest\r\ngeographical expeditions ever undertaken. He explored the Sea of\r\nKamchatka and during this voyage in 1728 he discovered Bering Strait\r\nand ascertained that Asia was not joined to America, thus becoming the\r\ndiscoverer of the extreme western boundary line of the continent.\r\n\r\nThe first visit of Scandinavians to America proper in post-Columbian\r\ntimes occurred in the year 1619, just a year before the landing of the\r\nPilgrims at Plymouth. In the spring of that year King Christian IV\r\nfitted out two ships, the _Eenhjorningen_ and the _Lamprenen_, for the\r\npurpose of finding a northwest passage to Asia. The commander of this\r\nexpedition was the Norwegian, Jens Munk, born at Barby in southern\r\nNorway in 1579. Sailing from Copenhagen with his two ships and\r\nsixty-six men May 9, 1619, he explored Hudson Bay and took possession\r\nof the surrounding country in the name of his sovereign and gave it\r\nthe name of Nova Dania. All the members of this expedition perished\r\nexcept Jens Munk and two of his crew, who returned to Norway September\r\n25, 1620, the undertaking having proved a complete failure. The ship\r\nchaplain on this expedition was a Danish Lutheran minister, Rasmus\r\nJensen Aarhus, the first minister to preach Lutheranism in the new\r\nworld. He died February 20, 1620, on the southwestern shore of Hudson\r\nBay at the mouth of the Churchill River. His last sermon was a funeral\r\nsermon preached from his own death bed.\r\n\r\nNorwegians and Danes came to New Amsterdam (New York) at a very early\r\nperiod. Traces of Scandinavians in New York can be found as early as\r\n1617. In 1704 these Norwegians and Danes built a stone church on the\r\ncorner of Broadway and Rector streets, where regular services were\r\nheld in the Danish language until the property was sold to Trinity\r\nChurch, the present churchyard occupying the site of the early\r\nbuilding. The first directory published in New York shows many names\r\nof unquestionable Norwegian or Danish origin.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the Swedes founded a settlement on the Delaware\r\nin 1638, and the Swedish language was used in a Philadelphia church as\r\nlate as 1823. John Morton, one of the signers of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and an active member of the Continental Congress, was a\r\ndescendant of the Swedes of Delaware. Robert Anderson, the gallant\r\ndefender of Fort Sumter, against which the first gun of the Civil War\r\nwas fired, was also a scion of the Swedes on the Delaware, and so it\r\nappears that love of freedom and patriotism and statecraft and valor\r\ncame to America not only in the _Mayflower_ but also in the\r\n_Kalmarnyckel_ and _Vogelgrip_, which brought the first Swedish\r\nsettlers to America in 1638.\r\n\r\nHow many Norwegians landed in America between the years 1492 and 1821\r\nit is impossible to determine. There are no government statistics to\r\nguide us and we know there was no regular or systematic emigration\r\nfrom any of the Scandinavian countries. It is certain that no\r\nNorwegians came in collective bodies to form settlements, and we can\r\ntrace them only through their descendants who have kept family records\r\nor through public documents or published works where they happen to be\r\nmentioned. In this way some of the Scandinavians who settled in New\r\nAmsterdam have been found.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner we find the names of Norwegians and Swedes who\r\ntook part in the war of the Revolution. There is the case of Thomas\r\nJohnson. In Volume 28 (1874) of the _New England Historical and\r\nGenealogical Register_ we find a full account of Thomas Johnson who\r\nserved under Paul Jones, first in the crew of the _Ranger_ and\r\nafterwards in the crew of the _Bonhomme Richard_. Johnson was the son\r\nof a pilot at Mandal, a seaport on the southwest coast of Norway,\r\nwhere he was born in 1758. In the absence of his father, he towed the\r\nfirst American vessel, the _Ranger_, commanded by Paul Jones, into the\r\nharbor of Mandal. After their arrival Jones sent for the young pilot\r\nand, presenting him with a piece of gold, expressed his pleasure at\r\nhis expert seamanship, which he had minutely watched during the towing\r\nof the ship into the harbor. Jones had made the port of Mandal for the\r\npurpose of recruiting the crew of the _Ranger_; and, satisfactory\r\narrangements having been made with his father, Johnson was received on\r\nboard as a seaman. Thomas Johnson died at the age of ninety-three at\r\nthe United States Naval Asylum in Philadelphia on July 12, 1851; he\r\nhad been there for many years a pensioner, and was known by the\r\nsoubriquet “Paul Jones.” The account of Thomas Johnson led me to\r\ninvestigate further into the history of John Paul Jones, and in his\r\nbiography, written by John Henry Sherburne, register of the navy of\r\nthe United States, published at Washington in 1825, I found a roll of\r\nofficers, seamen, marines, and volunteers who served on board the\r\n_Bonhomme Richard_ in her cruise made in 1779. In this roll the native\r\ncountry of every man is given and in it I found two seamen born in\r\nNorway and seven born in Sweden.\r\n\r\nHere I may also mention the brilliant Swede, Colonel Axel Fersen, who,\r\nin 1779, went to France where he was appointed colonel of the Royal\r\nRegiment of Swedes. He served with distinction at the head of his\r\nregiment in the later campaigns of the American War, distinguishing\r\nhimself on various occasions, particularly in 1781, during the siege\r\nof Yorktown, where he was aide-de-camp to General Rochambeau. He also\r\ntook part in the negotiations between General Washington and General\r\nRochambeau. He afterwards became Marshal of the kingdom of Sweden.\r\n\r\nIt is fair to presume that a considerable number of enterprising\r\nScandinavians found their way to their old Vinland during the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and particularly during the\r\nfirst quarter of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the American republic diplomatic and consular\r\nrelations were established with the Scandinavian countries, and there\r\nwas more or less commerce between Norway, Sweden, and Denmark and the\r\nUnited States. This financial and commercial intercourse would\r\nnaturally induce some Scandinavians to visit the United States and\r\nothers to settle within our gates. The many Scandinavian names found\r\nin the old directories of New York, Philadelphia, and other eastern\r\ncities are largely to be accounted for in this manner.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1820 the United States government supplies us with\r\nimmigration statistics, but in these Sweden and Norway are grouped\r\ntogether down to the year 1868, and hence it is impossible to\r\ndetermine until then how many immigrants came from each country. From\r\nthe year 1836 we are helped out by Norway, where the government then\r\nbegan to collect and prepare statistics of emigration.\r\n\r\nThe father of Norwegian emigration to the United States in the\r\nnineteenth century was Kleng Peerson from near Stavanger, Norway. In\r\nthe year 1821 he with a comrade, Knud Olson Eide, was sent from Norway\r\nto New York by the Society of Quakers in and near Stavanger for the\r\npurpose of making an investigation of conditions and opportunities in\r\nthe United States. After a sojourn of three years in America, all that\r\ntime being spent in and around New York City, they returned to Norway.\r\nHere their reports of social, political, and religious conditions in\r\nAmerica and their description of opportunities in the new world\r\nawakened great interest, inducing a resolution on the part of many to\r\nemigrate. Lars Larsen, the man at whose house the first Quaker meeting\r\nhad been held in Stavanger in 1816, at once undertook to organize a\r\nparty of emigrants. Being successful in finding the number of people\r\nwho were ready and willing to join him, the heads of families\r\nfurnished their scanty possessions in money and purchased a sloop\r\nwhich had been built in the Hardanger Fjord between Stavanger and\r\nBergen and which they loaded with a cargo of iron. For this sloop and\r\ncargo they paid the sum of $1,800.\r\n\r\nThis little Norwegian _Mayflower_ of the nineteenth century received\r\nthe name _Restaurationen_ (the “Restoration”) and on the day of\r\nAmerican Independence, July 4, 1825, the brave little company of\r\nemigrants sailed out of the harbor of the ancient and grotesque city\r\nof Stavanger. The company consisted of fifty-two persons, including\r\nthe two officers, chiefly from Stavanger City and Tysver Parish, north\r\nof Stavanger. They were fifty-two when they left Stavanger, but when\r\nthey reached New York on the second Sunday of October (October 9) they\r\nnumbered fifty-three, the wife of the leader, Larsen, having given\r\nbirth to a beautiful girl baby on the second of September.\r\n\r\nFrom 1825 to 1836 there was but little emigration from Norway. Before\r\n1836 there were no vessels carrying emigrants from Norway to America.\r\nThose who did emigrate came either by way of Gothenborg, Sweden, or\r\nHavre, in which cities passengers to America could be accommodated.\r\n\r\nGothenborg vessels carried Swedish iron to America but emigrants\r\nfrequently had to wait for weeks before they found a ship bound for\r\nNew York. From Hamburg regular packet ships carried German emigrants,\r\nbut these were so numerous that there was frequently a delay of from\r\ntwo to three weeks before they could be accommodated. In Havre the\r\nemigrant packets were also regular but there were not so many\r\nemigrants and the Norwegians could count on going on the first ship\r\nleaving port. This made Havre the most popular point of departure from\r\nEurope for the Norwegians.\r\n\r\nOf course, a great number of letters were written by the Norwegians in\r\nAmerica to relatives and friends in Norway and these were read by\r\nhundreds who were anxious to better their fortunes. Finally, one of\r\nthe sloop passengers, Knud Anderson Slogvig, returned to Norway in\r\n1835 and the news that he had arrived at his old home in the Skjold\r\ndistrict spread far and wide and created the greatest excitement. He\r\nwas the hero of the day. People traveled hundreds of miles to see and\r\ntalk with him. Letters from emigrants had been read with the deepest\r\ninterest but here was a man who had spent ten years in the new world!\r\nThrough Knud Slogvig the American fever spread beyond the limits of\r\nStavanger Amt and Christiansand Stift. This led to the great exodus of\r\n1836, when the two Koehler brigs, _Norden_ and _Den Norske Klippe_,\r\nwere fitted out for emigrants in Stavanger and left that summer loaded\r\nwith about two hundred passengers for New York. On board the _Norden_\r\nmy father and mother and my two oldest brothers were passengers. The\r\nAmerican fever continued, calling for two ships in 1837, the _Aegir_\r\nfrom Bergen and the _Enighedon_ from Egershund. Then there was a\r\npartial lull, until after 1840, when the American fever set in for\r\ngood. It has continued to rage ever since, culminating in the year\r\n1882, when over 29,000 Norwegians landed in the United States.\r\n\r\nThose who came in the sloop _Restaurationen_ settled in Kendall,\r\nOrleans County, New York, on the shores of Lake Ontario. In 1833 we\r\nfind Kleng Peerson in company with a Quaker, Ingebret Larsen Narvig,\r\nwho had come from Norway to Boston in 1831 and footed it from there to\r\nKendall, on their way to the far west. Larsen parted company with\r\nKleng and went to work for a farmer in Michigan. Kleng continued his\r\njourney westward until he reached La Salle County, Illinois, and there\r\nselected the location of the second Norwegian settlement in this\r\ncountry. Kendall and Fox River settlement in Illinois was his undying\r\nglory. Most of the settlers in Orleans County, New York, on the advice\r\nof Kleng, moved to the Fox River settlement. In 1836 these were joined\r\nby the 200 immigrants who came in the _Norden_ and the _Den Norske\r\nKlippe_, and in 1837 by many of those who came in the _Aegir_ and the\r\n_Enighedon_.\r\n\r\nOne of the Norwegians who came in the _Aegir_ was Ole Rynning, a name\r\nwell known in the annals of Norwegian immigration. On reaching Chicago\r\nhe was persuaded by a couple of Americans to go with some of his\r\nfriends to inspect lands some eighty miles south of Chicago along\r\nBeaver Creek with the view of founding a Norwegian settlement there.\r\nOle Rynning chose as his companions on this journey of inspection\r\nNiels Veste from Etne in Norway, Ingebrigt Brudvig, and Ole Nattestad\r\nfrom Numedal, Norway, the latter the author of the book herewith\r\npublished. Ole Nattestad and his brother, Ansten, had just arrived by\r\nway of Gothenborg, Sweden, and Fall River, Massachusetts, and joining\r\na group of other immigrants in Detroit, Michigan, had accompanied them\r\nto Chicago. The rest of the company remained in Chicago to await the\r\nresult. Ole Nattestad stated that he did not like the land, it being\r\nsandy and swampy, but as the others were pleased with it, it was\r\nagreed that Nattestad and Veste should remain and put up a log house\r\nfor the reception of the immigrants while Rynning and Brudvig returned\r\nto Chicago to fetch their friends.\r\n\r\nSome of those who were left in Chicago in the meantime had gone to the\r\nFox River settlement but the most of them went with Rynning and\r\nBrudvig to Beaver Creek. There were no settlers in the immediate\r\nvicinity and it was difficult to procure the common necessities of\r\nlife, although the most of these people were well supplied with money.\r\nMany of the new settlers grumbled and were inclined to find fault with\r\nOle Rynning and the others who were responsible for the selection of\r\nthis settlement. All chose land for farms, and before winter set in a\r\nsufficient number of log houses had been built. The number of settlers\r\nhere was about fifty. These people were well and happy in America\r\nduring the first winter, but the next spring the whole settlement was\r\nflooded and the swamp was turned into a veritable lake. In the summer\r\nthe settlers were attacked by malarial fever. In a short time no less\r\nthan fourteen or fifteen deaths occurred and among those who here\r\nfound his last resting place was Ole Rynning. The survivors fled,\r\nleaving farms and houses, as there was nobody to buy land where a\r\nmalarial atmosphere threatened the inhabitants with almost certain\r\ndestruction. The most of those who fled found their way to the Fox\r\nRiver settlement, reaching there late in the summer of 1838. Only a\r\nfew remained two or three years, defying the dangers to health and\r\nlife, the last one to leave the colony being Mons Aadland, a brother\r\nof the well-known journalist and author, Knud Langland. He finally\r\nexchanged his farm for a small number of cows at auction and went to\r\nRacine County, Wisconsin, where he lived to a ripe old age.\r\n\r\nOle Rynning became particularly conspicuous and influential on account\r\nof a book which he published in Christiania, Norway, in 1838, the\r\ntitle of which is “Sandfaerdig Beretning on Amerika til Oplysning og\r\nNytte for Bonde og Menigmand forfattet af en norsk, som kom derover i\r\nJuni Maaned 1837,” that is, “A Truthful Account of America for the\r\nInstruction and Help of the Peasant and Commoner Written by a\r\nNorwegian Who Came there in the Month of June, 1837.” The author’s\r\nname is given at the end of the preface where we read: “Illinois,\r\nFebruary 13, 1838, Ole Rynning.”\r\n\r\nThis little book of only thirty-nine pages is now exceedingly scarce.\r\nI obtained a copy of it from Rev. B. J. Muus of Goodhue County,\r\nMinnesota. In the nineties I reprinted it in _Amerika_ and struck off\r\nabout two hundred copies which I had bound and placed in various\r\nlibraries. A copy of it may be found in the library of the Wisconsin\r\nState Historical Society.\r\n\r\nWe began with Erik the Red and Leif Erikson and have now come to the\r\nbrothers, Ole and Ansten Nattestad. Ole K. Nattestad was born December\r\n24, 1807; died May 28, 1886. His wife died September 15, 1888. Ansten\r\nK. Nattestad was born August 20, 1813; died April 8, 1889.\r\n\r\nThe fourth Norwegian settlement in America and the first in Wisconsin\r\nwas founded by Ole Knudsen Nattestad (changed in America to Natesta)\r\nwho was accordingly the first Norwegian to set foot on Wisconsin soil.\r\nHe came to Clinton, Rock County, Wisconsin, July 1, 1838, and this was\r\nthe beginning of the so-called Jefferson Prairie settlement, which\r\noccupies the southeast corner of Rock County and extends into Boone\r\nCounty, Illinois. They came from Vegli, Rolloug Parish in Numedal,\r\nNorway, by way of Gothenborg and Fall River, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nWhen the Beaver Creek settlement was abandoned, Ansten Nattestad, in\r\nthe spring of 1838, returned to Norway, taking with him the Ole\r\nRynning manuscript and also the manuscript of a journal kept by his\r\nbrother, Ole Nattestad. Ansten stated that this manuscript of his\r\nbrother was published in Drammen, Norway, that same year but in spite\r\nof the most diligent search I have never been able to secure a copy of\r\nthat edition. In Norway copies of all publications are placed in the\r\nUniversity Library. I had this library searched for a copy of\r\nNattestad’s book but none could be found. In an interview published in\r\n_Billed Magazin_ in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1869, Ansten Nattestad made\r\nthe following statement:\r\n\r\n     In the spring of 1838 I went from Beaver Creek, Illinois, by\r\n     way of New Orleans to Liverpool in England and thence to\r\n     Norway to visit friends and acquaintances in my native land.\r\n     I brought with me letters from nearly all the earlier\r\n     Norwegian emigrants whom I had met and in this way\r\n     information was scattered far and wide in Norway. My\r\n     brother’s journal was published in Drammen and Ole Rynning’s\r\n     work on matters of the new world appeared at the same time\r\n     in Christiania. Of Rynning’s book I brought the manuscript\r\n     with me from America. The Rev. Mr. Kragh in Eidsvold read\r\n     the proofs and left out the chapter about the Norwegian\r\n     clergymen who therein were accused of intolerance in\r\n     religious matters and inactivity in questions concerning the\r\n     betterment of the people in temporal affairs and in\r\n     questions concerning the advancement of education.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Ole Nattestad gave the following account of himself in the\r\n_Billed Magazin_ referred to above:\r\n\r\n     As the next oldest of three brothers, I did not have the\r\n     right of primogeniture to my father’s farm which, according\r\n     to law, and custom, would go to the oldest son. My ambition\r\n     was to become a farmer, and I hoped some day to be able to\r\n     buy a farm in my own neighborhood. Then my brother entered\r\n     the military school in Christiania and I was to manage the\r\n     farm during his absence. I entered upon my task cheerfully,\r\n     worked with all my might and kept a careful account of\r\n     income and disbursements. To my great surprise, I soon found\r\n     that in spite of all my toil and prudence, I did not make\r\n     much headway. When the year was ended, I had little or\r\n     nothing left as a reward for my labor and it was clear to me\r\n     that it would not do to buy an expensive farm and run in\r\n     debt for it. Farming did not pay in the locality where I was\r\n     born. I then tried the occupation of an itinerant merchant.\r\n     I could earn a living in this way, but the laws were against\r\n     me and I did not like to carry on a business of such a\r\n     nature that it was necessary to keep my affairs secret from\r\n     the _lensmand_ [undersheriff]. Then I worked awhile as a\r\n     blacksmith. This furnished me enough to do, but it was\r\n     difficult to collect the money I earned. The law did not\r\n     permit me to work at my trade in the city. Then [in 1836] my\r\n     younger brother, Ansten, and I went across the mountains to\r\n     the western part of Norway to buy sheep which we intended to\r\n     sell again. While we were stopping in the vicinity of\r\n     Stavanger, we heard much talk about a country which was\r\n     called America. This was the first time we heard this word.\r\n     We saw letters written by Norwegians who were living in\r\n     America and we were told that Knud Slogvig, who, many years\r\n     before that had emigrated in a sloop [_Restaurationen_] from\r\n     Stavanger, had lately visited his native land and had given\r\n     so favorable a report about America that about 150 [should\r\n     be 200] emigrants from Stavanger Amt and from Hardanger had\r\n     gone back with him and had sailed that very summer [1836] in\r\n     two brigs from Stavanger across the ocean. They had gone in\r\n     spite of all sorts of threats and warnings about slavery,\r\n     death, and disease. This was the first large exodus after\r\n     the emigration of the sloop party in 1825. All that we here\r\n     saw was so new and came to us so unexpectedly that we were\r\n     not at once able to arrange all the reports into a\r\n     systematic whole and thus get a correct idea of conditions\r\n     in the new world. But when I spent the following Christmas\r\n     with Even Nubbru who was a member of the Storthing from\r\n     Sigdal we discussed the hard times in my native valley and I\r\n     suggested that I might have better luck in some other part\r\n     of the country. In replying Even Nubbru remarked that\r\n     wherever I went in the world, I would nowhere find a people\r\n     who had as good laws as the Americans. He had accidentally\r\n     just had the opportunity of reading something about America\r\n     in a German newspaper and he described the free institutions\r\n     of America. This information had a magic effect on me as I\r\n     looked upon it as an injustice that the laws of Norway\r\n     should forbid me to trade and not allow me to get my living\r\n     by honest work as a mechanic wherever I desired to locate. I\r\n     had confidence in the judgment of the member of the\r\n     Storthing and I compared his remarks with what I had heard\r\n     about America in the vicinity of Stavanger. Gradually I got\r\n     to thinking of emigration and while considering the matter\r\n     on my way home, the idea matured into a resolution. My\r\n     brother Ansten did not have to be asked a second time. He\r\n     was willing at once; he approved of my plans and in April,\r\n     1837, we were ready for our journey. When we left home, we\r\n     had together about eight hundred dollars, Norwegian money,\r\n     but this sum gradually grew less on account of our expenses\r\n     on the way and besides we lost considerable in changing our\r\n     money into American coin. Ansten also paid the passage for\r\n     Halsten Halvorsen Braekke-Eiet who now [1869] resides in\r\n     Dodgeville [Wisconsin], and is looked upon as an excellent\r\n     blacksmith.\r\n\r\n     Our equipment consisted of the clothes we wore, a pair of\r\n     skis, and a knapsack. People looked at us with wonder and\r\n     intimated that we must have lost our senses. They suggested\r\n     that we had better hang ourselves in the first tree in order\r\n     to avoid a worse fate. We went on skis across the mountains\r\n     from Rolloug to Tin and thence in a direct line over hills\r\n     and through forests to Stavanger, where we expected to get\r\n     passage across the sea. We did not worry about the roads for\r\n     all three of us were experts on skis and our baggage caused\r\n     us no inconvenience. In Stavanger we told everybody that we\r\n     were going to America and wanted to secure passage across\r\n     the sea. This open-heartedness came near spoiling our plans.\r\n     The report of three mountaineers soon spread over the whole\r\n     city and high government officials came to see our\r\n     passports. We were now told that the bailiff’s passport only\r\n     permitted us to go to Stavanger while the certificate from\r\n     the pastor correctly stated that we intended to leave the\r\n     country and emigrate to America. We were not versed in such\r\n     things and thought our papers were in order, especially as\r\n     the documents we carried gave testimony that we were men of\r\n     good habits and Christian conduct. No suspicious remarks\r\n     were made but in the evening there came a man who was angry\r\n     on account of the wrong the officials were going to do us\r\n     and related that it had been resolved that we were to be\r\n     arrested the following day and then to be sent from\r\n     _lensmand_ to _lensmand_ to our native valley as we intended\r\n     to leave the country without permission being given in the\r\n     passport from the bailiff. The government here, he said, was\r\n     in a bitter rage against all emigrants and we could not\r\n     count on any mercy. On this man’s advice we departed\r\n     secretly from Stavanger under cover of night in order to\r\n     avoid the danger that threatened us and without attracting\r\n     any attention we got to Tananger. Here we met a skipper who,\r\n     with his yacht loaded with herring, was ready to sail to\r\n     Gothenborg. He promised to take us on board, but when we\r\n     told him what had happened to us in Stavanger, he became\r\n     doubtful. He praised our honesty, and on further assurance\r\n     that we would assume all responsibility if we got in\r\n     trouble, he decided to accept us as passengers. We acted\r\n     discreetly while we were ashore and we felt greatly relieved\r\n     when we finally got to sea. In Gothenborg we had no mishaps,\r\n     and we secured passage in a vessel loaded with Swedish iron\r\n     and bound for Fall River, Massachusetts. The journey lasted\r\n     thirty-two days and we paid fifty dollars each for\r\n     transportation and board. From Fall River we went to New\r\n     York where we met a few Norwegians who helped us to get to\r\n     Rochester. Here we talked with some of our countrymen who,\r\n     twelve years ago, had come in the sloop from Stavanger that\r\n     brought the first Norwegian immigrants to America. Rochester\r\n     and vicinity did not meet our expectations in regard to the\r\n     new world. Many of the first immigrants had left the first\r\n     settlement in Kendall and had gone west to find new lands,\r\n     particularly to La Salle County, Illinois, near Ottawa on\r\n     the Fox River. The Fox River colony received a very\r\n     considerable increment by the great exodus from Stavanger in\r\n     1836, that is, the year before I came to America. The most\r\n     of these immigrants had located in that settlement. This we\r\n     learned in Rochester, and there we heard for the first time\r\n     the name Chicago. We determined to go west and see what we\r\n     could find. When we had reached Detroit, I was walking in\r\n     the streets to look at the town. There I accidentally met a\r\n     man by whose clothes I could see that he was from the\r\n     western coast of Norway. I greeted the man and he returned\r\n     my greeting, and the meeting was like that of two brothers\r\n     who had not seen each other for years. He informed me that\r\n     he had left Bergen some months before, together with about\r\n     seventy [should be eighty-four] passengers and that the\r\n     whole company of which the University secretary, Ole\r\n     Rynning, was the leader, had been waiting a week for\r\n     transportation to Chicago. We were glad to meet our\r\n     countrymen and we joined the party, in which there was at\r\n     least one [Rynning] who could speak English. On landing in\r\n     Chicago we met Bjorn Anderson Kvelve [the father of the\r\n     present editor] from the Stavanger company. He had come to\r\n     America the year before [1836] and had travelled through\r\n     various parts of Illinois but all that he had heard and seen\r\n     had only served to make him dissatisfied with this side of\r\n     the ocean. Broken down in soul and body, he stood before us\r\n     as a victim of misery and produced a scene so terrible that\r\n     it never will be blotted from my memory. “God bless and\r\n     comfort you!” said he. “There is neither work nor land nor\r\n     food to be had and by all means do not go to Fox River;\r\n     there you will all die from malarial fever.” These words had\r\n     a terrible effect on our little flock, many of whom had\r\n     already lost all courage. Like demons from the lower world,\r\n     all the evil warnings about the terrors that awaited the\r\n     emigrants to America were now called to mind and even the\r\n     bravest were as by magic stricken by a panic which bordered\r\n     on insanity. The women wrung their hands in despair and\r\n     uttered terrible shrieks of woe. Some of the men stood\r\n     immovable like statues with all the marks of frightful\r\n     despair on their faces, while others made threats against\r\n     those whom they regarded as the promoters of emigration and\r\n     the leaders of the party. But in this critical situation Ole\r\n     Rynning’s greatness appeared. He stood in the midst of the\r\n     people who were ready for mutiny; he comforted those in\r\n     despair and gave advice to those who doubted and hesitated\r\n     and reproved those who were obstinate. He was not in doubt\r\n     for a moment and his equanimity, courage, and noble\r\n     self-sacrifice for the weal of others had acquired him\r\n     influence in the minds of all. The storm abated and the\r\n     dissatisfaction gave place to a unanimous confidence. A\r\n     couple of Americans with whom Rynning talked advised him to\r\n     take the immigrants to Beaver Creek, directly south of\r\n     Chicago in Iroquois County.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the story told about my father must, to say the\r\nleast, be overdrawn. The facts as I have them from my mother, from\r\nMons Aadland, and even from Ole Nattestad himself, do not warrant the\r\npainting of so weird a picture. All the prose there is in the romance\r\nis that my father met these people in Chicago and was unwilling to\r\nrecommend the Fox River settlement with which he was not pleased, and\r\nas he had never seen Iroquois County, he had no share in recommending\r\nthe immigrants to go to Beaver Creek. His dissatisfaction with the Fox\r\nRiver settlement is further confirmed by the fact that in 1840 he\r\nfound a new home in Albion, Dane County, Wisconsin. In support of my\r\nview, I may here quote the words of Prof. Svein Nilsson in _Billed\r\nMagazin_ (1869) where, in alluding to the Beaver Creek settlement he\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n     Ole Rynning’s company met Bjorn Anderson Kvelve in Chicago.\r\n     The unfavorable description he gave of the land both west\r\n     and north frightened the immigrants from locating in any of\r\n     the existing Norwegian colonies and this resulted in the\r\n     founding of the Beaver Creek Settlement whose sad story is\r\n     well known to the Scandinavian population in the northwest.\r\n     In this connection bitter reproaches have been directed\r\n     against Bjorn Anderson Kvelve as being in a great measure to\r\n     blame for the fatalities of Beaver Creek. But it is usually\r\n     the case that people like to seek in others the cause of\r\n     their misfortune. This is true of the individual as well as\r\n     of corporations and societies and perhaps a little more so\r\n     in the case of the immigrants visited by adversity. At all\r\n     events, it is our opinion that we do a justice to the man\r\n     when we say that the criticism of Bjorn Anderson Kvelve has\r\n     been too severe, if not utterly unfounded.\r\n\r\nOle Nattestad continues:\r\n\r\n     In the spring of 1838 my brother, Ansten, went to Norway and\r\n     I worked by the day in the northern part of Illinois.\r\n\r\n     The first of July, 1838, I came to my present home in about\r\n     the middle of the town of Clinton, Rock County, Wisconsin,\r\n     where I bought land and I am consequently the first\r\n     Norwegian to settle in this state. So far as known, no other\r\n     Norwegian had planted his feet on Wisconsin soil before me.\r\n     For a whole year I saw no countryman but lived alone without\r\n     friend, family, or companion. Eight Americans had settled in\r\n     the town before me but they lived about as isolated as I\r\n     did. I found the soil very fertile and the monotony of the\r\n     prairie was relieved by small bunches of trees. Deer and\r\n     other game were abundant. The horrid howl of the prairie\r\n     wolf disturbed my sleep until habit armed my ears against\r\n     annoyances of this sort. The following summer [1839] I built\r\n     a little log hut and in this residence I received in\r\n     September a number of people from my own parish in Norway.\r\n     They had come as immigrants with my brother, Ansten. The\r\n     most of these settled on Jefferson Prairie and in this way\r\n     the settlement got a large population in a comparatively\r\n     short time.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Ole Nattestad married Lena Hiser who died September 15, 1888.\r\nShe left seven children, all well educated and in good circumstances.\r\nHenry, the youngest son, now occupies the old homestead.\r\n\r\nWe now pass to Ansten Nattestad, the brother of Ole, and will let him\r\ntell the story as published in the _Billed Magazin_:\r\n\r\n     In the spring of 1838 I went by way of New Orleans to\r\n     Liverpool and thence to Norway to visit friends and\r\n     acquaintances in my native land…. [What he tells about\r\n     Rynning’s and his brother Ole’s manuscripts has already been\r\n     stated.] I spent the winter in Numedal. The report of my\r\n     return spread like wildfire through the land and an\r\n     incredible number of people came to see me and to get news\r\n     from America. Many came as far as twenty Norwegian [140\r\n     English] miles to have a talk with me. It was impossible to\r\n     answer all the letters I received asking questions about the\r\n     condition of things on the other side of the ocean. In the\r\n     spring of 1839 about 100 persons from Numedal stood ready to\r\n     go with me across the sea. Among these were many farmers and\r\n     heads of families, all, excepting the children, able-bodied\r\n     persons in their best years. Besides these there were a\r\n     number from Thelemarken and from Numedal who were unable to\r\n     join me as our ship was full. We went from Drammen direct to\r\n     New York. It was the first time the inhabitants of Drammen\r\n     saw an emigrant ship. [The name of the ship was _Emelia_ and\r\n     the Captain’s name was Ankerson]. Each person paid $33.50\r\n     for his passage. We were nine weeks on the sea; the passage\r\n     was a successful one and there was no death on board. From\r\n     New York we took the common route up the country. In\r\n     Milwaukee we met those from Tin and Thelemarken and the\r\n     others who were unable to come in our ship across the sea.\r\n     [They had come by way of Gothenborg, Sweden, to Boston.]\r\n     They came on board to us and wanted us to go with them to\r\n     Muskego, Wisconsin. Men had been out there to inspect the\r\n     country and they reported that the grass was so high that it\r\n     reached up to their shoulders and told of many other\r\n     glorious things. The Americans, too, used every argument to\r\n     persuade us to stop in Milwaukee. I objected and we\r\n     continued our journey. In Chicago I learned that my brother,\r\n     Ole, had settled in Wisconsin during my absence in Norway.\r\n     Some of the party went to the Fox River settlement where\r\n     they had acquaintances, while some unmarried persons found\r\n     employment in Chicago and vicinity. The rest of them, that\r\n     is to say, the majority, accompanied me to Jefferson\r\n     Prairie. Among these were a few who settled in the town of\r\n     Rock Run, Stevenson County, in the northern part of Illinois\r\n     about fifty miles southwest from Jefferson Prairie, and\r\n     there they formed the nucelus of the Norwegian settlement.\r\n     Others of my company went to Rock Prairie, a few miles west\r\n     of Jefferson Prairie. I and the rest came at once to\r\n     Jefferson Prairie where we bought land and began to\r\n     cultivate it.\r\n\r\n     In 1840 a few came here from Numedal and from that time the\r\n     number of settlers steadily increased, chiefly by new\r\n     arrivals from Norway. The most of those from Numedal settled\r\n     in the northern part of the colony, for we who came after my\r\n     brother, who was here before any of us, bought land in the\r\n     place where he had built his cabin and those from the same\r\n     part of Norway who came later as immigrants and who sought\r\n     us out in the far west settled as our neighbors. I and the\r\n     first Numedalians chose this tract as our home and our\r\n     choice was made immediately after our arrival. The same\r\n     autumn, 1839, a company from Voss in Norway came to the\r\n     settlement. These Vossings went farther south and as “birds\r\n     of a feather flock together” so their friends from Voss\r\n     gradually settled with them. Hence the Jefferson Prairie\r\n     settlement, as to population, may be divided into two\r\n     districts, of which the northern consists chiefly of\r\n     Numedalians while the Vossings predominate in the southern\r\n     part.\r\n\r\nIn searching for the Nattestad book I learned that Ole Nattestad had\r\npreserved a manuscript copy of it and that sometime in the eighties he\r\nhad handed this to Prof. Peter Hendrickson, then editor-in-chief of\r\n_Skandinaven_ in Chicago, with the view of having the manuscript\r\nrevised and reprinted; but before Professor Hendrickson found time to\r\ndo this work, his home in Evanston, Illinois, was burned to the ground\r\nand in this fire the Nattestad manuscript was lost. Not long since,\r\nhowever, it was shown that the Nattestad book was not a myth. Mr. H.\r\nL. Skavlem of Janesville, Wisconsin, is a most patient and thorough\r\nstudent of Norwegian pioneer life in America, and especially of\r\neverything pertaining to the people who have emigrated from Numedal.\r\nIn 1915 he published an account of the “Skavlem and Odegaarden\r\nFamilies in this Country” which is a masterpiece of genealogical\r\nrecords and pioneer history. Mr. Skavlem, beside being an authority on\r\nIndian relics and on Wisconsin bird life, has done much to preserve\r\nthe history of the Norwegians in America. It was he who secured a\r\nprinted copy of the Nattestad book for preservation in the library of\r\nthe State Historical Society, so far as known the only copy in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TITLE PAGE OF OLE NATTESTAD’S “JOURNEY TO NORTH\r\n  AMERICA”\r\n  Photographed from the copy in the Wisconsin Historical Library]\r\n\r\nOf this copy, which is now being printed in an English translation,\r\nMr. Skavlem gives the following account:\r\n\r\n     In the summer of the year 1900 James and Henry Natesta, the\r\n     sons of Ole K. Nattestad, the author of the pamphlet, took a\r\n     short trip to Norway to visit the home of their forefathers,\r\n     located in Vegli, Numedal. They made diligent inquiries for\r\n     a pamphlet said to have been published from a manuscript\r\n     sent to Norway in 1838 by their father. An old gentleman\r\n     living close by the old homestead told them he had a copy,\r\n     which they secured and brought back with them to this\r\n     country. This copy has been in the possession of the Natesta\r\n     brothers until last January (1916) when it was turned over\r\n     to me and I handed it over to the State Historical Society.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the book, or pamphlet, it is to be stated that while Ole\r\nNattestad had learned to write, he was entirely ignorant of Norwegian\r\ngrammar. Both his orthography and his syntax are very faulty. There\r\nare many subordinate clauses with the principal clause left out. The\r\nsurprising thing is that the printers in Drammen did not make the\r\nnecessary corrections. I was requested to follow the original as\r\nclosely as possible, so as to convey to the reader of the translation\r\nas complete a presentation of the original as possible. The mistakes\r\nin orthography could only be reproduced in the translation where they\r\nconcerned proper names. The faults in syntax I have generally\r\nreproduced. The reader will have to be the judge of how well I have\r\nsucceeded. The book is of more than ordinary interest from the fact\r\nthat it contains a description of an emigrant’s journey from Norway to\r\nChicago in 1837, the only description we have of that kind, and also\r\nfrom the fact that it is written by the first immigrant from Norway\r\nwho set foot on Wisconsin soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF A JOURNEY TO NORTH AMERICA\r\n\r\nBY OLE KNUDSEN NATTESTAD\r\n\r\nIn the year 1837, the 8th of April, we started from our homestead, the\r\nfarm Nattestad, in Weglie-Parish, Rolloug Parson’s District, in\r\nNummedal in Norway, for the purpose of trying our fortune in another\r\npart of the world, namely in the free states in North America. We\r\njourneyed with an agreeable weather till in the evening of the 11th of\r\nthe same month. That day we came to the farm Flotyl, at the foot of\r\nStorfjeldet (Big Mountain). In the morning the weather was tolerably\r\nclear. We began to climb the mountain. When we had gone some distance\r\nthere began a strong storm with snow and wind and it became so dark\r\nthat we could not see the least from us. As luck would have it, we\r\nfound a path which had been used with marsh shoes on the horses’ feet\r\nover the mountain, and this path we stuck to for the most part, so\r\nthat we, thanks be to God, made our way safely. We rested a while at\r\nJordbraek, then we went to Roarquam, where we expected to stop over\r\nnight. As soon as we entered the house there came a man with a boat\r\nwhose home was 1¾ miles [the Norwegian mile is about seven English\r\nmiles] farther out on a farm by name Quildal. We were allowed to\r\nfollow him home without pay. There we stayed one day because Ansteen\r\nbecame so weak in his eyes that he could not see to walk, but after we\r\nleft this place we, for the most part got transportation to Stavanger.\r\nThere we got trace of a man by name Elias Tastad, with whom all who\r\nwanted to go to America inscribed their names. To the above named E.\r\nTastad we arrived the 17th of April. The man named said that “they who\r\ndesire to sail to America from Stavanger will not get a ship before\r\nafter St. Johnstide, and still it was not certain what time it would\r\nbe. But go to Tenager which lies one mile west from here. There lie\r\nherring boats which go to Gothenborg and see that you get passage with\r\none of them,--that is the best.” As we were informed we went to the\r\nplace mentioned and at once met a man from Kobbervigen, by name\r\nEngebret Rise, from whom we got terms and whom we were to go with. It\r\nwas said that the above named person, E. Tastad, was a Quaker, and he\r\nwas a particularly kind-hearted man and he gave us advice in many\r\nthings. The 18th of the same month we went on board and sailed to the\r\nharbor Rekfjord; there we lay for 8 days, weather-bound. It is 8 miles\r\nnorth of Lindesnaes. From there we sailed the 28th of the same month.\r\nWhen we came some distance out they had neglected to take water on\r\nboard. They, therefore, sailed in to Kirkehavn to get water. In the\r\nevening when we came out upon the sea again it was perfectly calm and\r\nthe fog lay so thick that we could not see a single thing. The calm\r\ncontinued until in the afternoon, then we got a little breeze which\r\nincreased and came from the southeast until it grew into a perfect\r\nstorm so the waves washed entirely over the ship. That night the storm\r\ndrove us back to Kirkehavn again. There we lay till the 3rd of May,\r\nthen we sailed from there with a pleasant wind and clear weather. That\r\nday all ships that were there left the harbor, that before had to lie\r\nstill. Then there were swarms of ships as far as we could see out upon\r\nthe ocean. Oh, how delightful it was to look into this beautiful\r\nweather. The same day we called in Mandal, 3 miles southeast from\r\nLindesnaes; after a few hours we sailed out from there with the same\r\nwind and the next morning we got sight of land at Skagen in Jylland\r\n(Scaw in Jutland) which is 30 miles from Mandal. The 5th of May we\r\ncame to Gothenborg. From New Elfsborg’s Fort ½ mile outside of the\r\ncity came first an officer on board who countersigned our passports\r\nand when we came to the custom house wharf the captain went ashore to\r\nexhibit our passports there. Afterwards there came officials on board\r\nwho sealed the cargo of the ship and who also talked with us about our\r\nproposed long journey. The next day the captain went about in the city\r\nwith us and went to the office of Consul Vestberg, who procured\r\npassage for passengers and who has information as to whither all ships\r\nsail from there. Now, there lay a large ship ready to sail which was\r\nloaded with iron which should go to America, and one by name Vigen was\r\nthe owner of it and one by name Captain Ronneberg was to take it\r\nacross. Vestberg went at the same time with us to Vigen and talked\r\nwith him for us. He demanded 200 dollars Rigsgjelds [Swedish money].\r\nThat made about 54 speciedaler [Norwegian money]. Now, we were in\r\ndistress because it was so awfully dear, but our former carrier, named\r\nEngebret Rise, persuaded us that we should not refuse it. “Consider,”\r\nsaid he, “that you might lie here a whole month and still perhaps have\r\nto pay almost the same.”--We went to Vestberg again and asked if he\r\ncould not do it cheaper. “I will go with you up there,” said he, “so\r\nyou get to talk with him.” He went up and said that we asked if he\r\ncould do it cheaper. He stood a little while. “For 50 speciedaler I\r\nwill do it and that is the very cheapest. Then you will get on board\r\nwhat you need for sustenance.” We accepted this and Engebret Rise said\r\nthat we should accept. Now, we had gotten transportation. We then went\r\non board after our baggage and E. Rise accompanied us ashore again to\r\na shoemaker of whom we bought a pair of boots and shoes for each of\r\nus, and to one by name Fru Bokkom who had all kinds of clothes for\r\nsale. There we bought clothes. She asked if we had gotten lodgings. We\r\nanswered, “No.” “From me you can get a room alone without pay when you\r\nprovide yourselves with food and wood and fuel you shall have what you\r\nwant to cook it with,” said she. We accepted this offer with gratitude\r\nand there were very comfortable. On Sunday we went into town and into\r\nthe Cathedral and heard sermons or mass and there were to be seen many\r\nstrange things besides the other things which we saw in the city.--On\r\nMonday we went on the market to buy us something of this and that.\r\nThere stood one and beckoned to us. He asked if we were from Norway.\r\n“Perhaps you are going over to America,” said he, (and asked) whether\r\nwe had gotten transportation. We said, “Yes! We have gotten and we are\r\nto go with the ship belonging to Vigen”; “how much are you then to\r\npay?” When he got to know this he became violently angry and denounced\r\nus as big fools who had paid so much. Had we come to him he would have\r\nsaved us 20 speciedaler for each of us--this was a Jew who stood and\r\nchanged money and an awfully ugly person to look at with black hair\r\nand beard and indescribably thick and fat. Then he asked us if we had\r\nmore money to change than what we paid in transportation. Then we must\r\ncome to him. “You cannot get your money changed anywhere else than\r\nwith me,” said he, and told us how high the rate was; we would come to\r\nhim the next day, we said. He said we should go to Vigen and offer him\r\n20 spd each if we could get our money back; “but you will still not\r\nget it back for he well knows what he has done.”\r\n\r\nWe went to Vigen and said that we might have gotten transportation\r\nalmost 20 spd cheaper if we had waited a little while. “Yes!” said he,\r\n“if it is so that you regret what you have done you shall get your\r\nmoney back again, that is the kind of man I am and will not cheat you\r\nif you would rather have the money back again”; and then we thought\r\nthe matter over and let it be just as it had been done. We noticed\r\nsomething, that the Jew wanted to talk to his own advantage. Tuesday\r\nmorning we were to come to Vestberg to get some money changed. We came\r\nat the time appointed, he counted the money and kept it. When he had\r\ndone this he said we should come back in the afternoon, he did not yet\r\nhave the kind of money, he first wanted to go out; we were very much\r\nastonished at this, I went in again and told what I thought of this,\r\nthat we had delivered the money and gotten nothing in return. “You\r\nmust not believe that we are that kind of people,” and then he went\r\naway again--we went on the market and there we discovered Vestberg\r\ntalking with the Jew. We stood looking at this and wondering if it was\r\nabout our money they were talking, which it also was. When Vestberg\r\nwent the Jew discovered us and came to us but it was the brother of\r\nthe one heretofore named. He then told us that Vestberg asked him\r\nafter the rate of exchange. “Vestberg would get you a note from Vigen\r\nthat you are to get your money in America, but this you must not do.\r\nGo with me and you shall get your money changed.” We answered that we\r\ndid not have the money in our pockets, but we could come back in a\r\nlittle while. At the time appointed we came into Vestberg again and\r\nthen the Jew stood inside and argued with the clerk about the changing\r\nof our money and that amused us. Then we plainly heard who was our\r\nfriend, the Jew or Vestberg. The Jew wanted us to exchange our money\r\nand Vestberg did not want to give as high a rate as demanded; he said,\r\n“if it is no more than a skilling [a penny] they are to have it and\r\nnow they will make 10½ skillings on every spd when they get their\r\nmoney in America, for on the ocean you need no money,” said Vestberg.\r\n\r\nThe Jew in his way with a well-nigh matchless eloquence and who\r\nthereon was thundering mad at Vestberg because he did not get his way,\r\nbut it was of no help to him when we learned of the Jew’s speculation\r\nfor which he fought with us. When the Jew did not succeed he had to go\r\nbut he stood in the door and scolded them as he also had done before.\r\nWe got a note each which was printed in the English language which\r\nstated how much money we had and how high the exchange rate was and\r\nhow many piasters we were to have in return; this note was from Vigen,\r\nthe owner of the ship to the Swedish Consul in America, from whom we\r\nwere to get the money and we got one (note) which was written and\r\nwhich we were to retain when we delivered the others.\r\n\r\nWednesday morning we went aboard and after that we lived there;\r\nThursday, the 11th we sailed out of the harbor; then there was on\r\nboard the owner of the ship together with many distinguished men who\r\naccompanied it a short distance; when these had gone into the boat and\r\ngotten a little distance from the ship there were fired 4 salvos with\r\nthe big cannons. Afterwards there was shouting of hurrahs, first by\r\nthose in the boats, afterwards by the ship’s crew. Off New Elfsborg’s\r\nFort, a half mile from the city 4 salvos were also fired and 2 in\r\nresponse by the fort; then we took our leave from the city.\r\n\r\nA little story about the ship by name _Hilda_, on which we were\r\npassengers, the most beautiful ship in all Gothenborg, and almost in\r\nall Sweden, it was said; it had made a single journey to America\r\nbefore, otherwise it was new and with copper bottom and it was upon\r\nthe whole as if it were cast (in a mold), it was furnished with 2\r\ndecks, a lower deck 3 ells high to the ceiling which (the deck) was\r\npainted blue on the sides and up under the upper deck yellow and\r\nlikewise above the deck and quarter deck 2½ ells high and very tight\r\nand strongly made and blue painted; the upper part was upon the whole\r\nconstructed like a door of glass and painted with yellow brass and the\r\npanels blue. Astern stood a cabin on the deck which was polished both\r\nexternally and internally and also on the lower deck and in both of\r\nthem as beautiful furniture as can be made. In the front was placed\r\nworks of sculpture all gilt, likewise in the stern and a maiden carved\r\nin wood in the most beautiful draperies and fineries that could be\r\nfound and as if she were a living being. From Elfsborg, as heretofore\r\nmentioned, we sailed with a fair wind to the day of Pentecost, then it\r\nbecame calm and we had reached the Faröe Islands, which lie north of\r\nScotland. The second day of Pentecost there came one from Jutland and\r\nwanted to go to the Faröes with 12 men and these came on board and got\r\nsome water; then we first heard English talked. From there we sailed\r\nmostly with good wind but awhile before we came to the New Foundland\r\nbanks; we saw 5 icebergs (it was pieces or lumps which drift south\r\nfrom the polar ocean), the one was like a large building to look at.\r\nSunday morning, the 4th of June, came we to the banks, this morning\r\nthere were caught 62 pounds and 10 mkr of codfish. The above named\r\nbanks are a shallow 80 fathoms deep and a few hundred miles in\r\ncircumference, which lie about 300 miles from America. There always\r\nlie ships which only fish. From there we sailed with a favorable wind;\r\nthe 11th of June in the morning, 9 o’clock, we first saw land in\r\nAmerica and were therefore not more than 32 days from leaving until we\r\ncame to land. In the evening there came a pilot on board and at 12\r\no’clock we came into the city Nyport, where we lay at anchor a little\r\nwhile. In the morning when I arose and came upon the deck I saw\r\nsomething new; for the city and also the country around about was\r\ndelightful for me to see. At 12 o’clock we sailed from there up to\r\nFalreva [Fall River] which lies 18 miles northeast from here. Here the\r\nship stopped and the cargo was here sold. On the journey from Nyport\r\nto there was many agreeable things to see; the land on both sides was\r\nso splendid and particularly the beautiful trees which there here\r\ngrows a multitude of. As soon as we came to the above named Falreva\r\nthere came a Norwegian watchmaker apprentice on board who had gotten\r\nknowledge of the fact that a Swedish boat had entered and he was from\r\nChristiania; it was agreeable to get to talk with our fellow\r\ncountryman. He informed us concerning many things which were useful to\r\nus.--Here in the city we have now gone about and looked at many\r\nbeautiful curiosities; especially in machine shops and factories of\r\nwhich there here are a great number; among other things we first\r\ninspected an iron factory, very strange. What here was used as\r\nmaterial was nothing but burnt and rusty iron such as machine scraps,\r\nboilers, stove pipes, and other scraps. This was first cut up by a\r\nlarge iron knife which cut it into threads even if it was 2 inches\r\nthick. Afterwards it was smelted and cut into strings. These strings\r\nwere heated one time and with this it went through some rollers 10 to\r\n11 times and became hoop-iron between 1 and 2 inches wide and 15 to 16\r\nells long and over. These stringers were delivered to another building\r\nin which there were 50 work benches. There was made nails of these\r\nstringers. The nail was cut from the end of the stringer and this went\r\nso fast almost as corn running from a mill and was done by one man.\r\nThese machines were very strange and many things which I here on\r\naccount of time and space cannot describe.--The first mate on board\r\ntold us that he had never seen the equal although he had been in many\r\nlands in Europe and in many cities in America.\r\n\r\nHe said we ought to go there and see, it would be interesting for us;\r\nwe did not dare to go because we did not know the language and none of\r\nthe ship’s crew had time to go with us; but the first mate said we\r\nmight go. “I think you will be allowed to anyway,” and he told us what\r\nwe should say when we came there.--We went there and asked in English\r\nif we could look over the factory; it was permitted. One went with us\r\nfrom one room to another; it lasted fully 2 hours and we did not see\r\nanything but new things wherever we came so that for want of space am\r\nnot able to describe how it was. From the weaving factory the goods\r\ncame there and the first work there was to bleach it and that went\r\nfast, afterwards it was made ready with flowers and colors as it was\r\nto be. Yes, here were some ship-loads of cotton cloths with many other\r\nthings which were here which I cannot describe.--The 17th of May we\r\nwent from Falreva on a steamboat to Provedens, which is 30 miles. The\r\ncaptain went with us to Provedens and got transportation to New York\r\nfor us. The steamboat we went from Provedens to New York on was very\r\nlarge. It was certainly 100 ells long, with 2 engines and so many\r\nstrange appliances which I had never been able to imagine before.\r\nThere were 10 to 12 black negroes which prepared the food and some\r\ncarried it to and from the tables. Ah! here was much to see for us.\r\nThe room which we were best able to examine was certainly of 30 ells\r\nlength and two dining tables which were loaded with dishes and\r\ndrinking cups as close together as possible and all of porcelain\r\nstoneware and the glasses looked like crystal; but all who ate there I\r\nhave not the number of; on both sides in this room was bed after bed\r\n[sofas]; curtains and sheets which we saw there were of the choicest\r\ncalico and some looked like silk. The carpets looked like the finest\r\ncamel’s hair cloth and many other things which I cannot here\r\ndescribe.--This journey from Provedens to New York was 230 miles and\r\nwe were 12 hours on the way; now we were among foreign nations and did\r\nnot understand their language the least. When we came to New York it\r\nbecame worse as we had to go ashore; there came many who talked to us\r\nbut we didn’t understand them and no more they us; but I suppose they\r\nasked us where we were going; at last there came one on board who\r\ntalked to us; when he heard that we did not understand he said that we\r\nshould go with him. I went with him, he went into a little store;\r\nthere was a French man who was to talk to me and asked if I was from\r\nFrance; I said I was Norwegian. He went away from me. Then there came\r\none that so far as I could understand was from the region near France.\r\nHe asked me where I was from, I answered from Norwegian, this he\r\nunderstood and said, “that is far away”; then I was to stop there\r\nwhile one went out on the street; he soon came back again and had with\r\nhim a person who could talk a little Norwegian and would come with me\r\non board; when we got on the way he told me that he was Swedish and\r\nNorwegian Consul. From the boat we took our baggage and went with this\r\nman to a basement which was a boarding house and there this consul had\r\nhis home and there we should stay and he should advise us and get\r\ntransportation to Rochester. When we came into the city we saw a\r\nNorwegian flag on a ship and some Swedish (flags); now my comrades\r\nwent to see if they could find these ships; they met first a Swede and\r\nafterwards a Norwegian who was from Arendal and had come from England\r\nwith 140 passengers; when they had talked with these they came to me\r\nagain who was sitting inside and keeping watch over the baggage, now\r\nwent I and my brother out for I had letters from our first mate which\r\nwere addressed to a Swedish ship which lay in the harbor there and was\r\nthe same one which they had been aboard and so I got the letters\r\nproperly presented. When we came to the Norwegian ship again there\r\ncame on board a shoemaker from Bergen who had come to America a year\r\nbefore and had come with one from Christiansand by name Jansen who was\r\nmarried and who was a merchant; when we came to talk with them the\r\nmerchant said we should get lodgings at his home. We first went with\r\nhim to his house. He immediately went to the place where we had our\r\nbaggage; when we got there the house was so full of people that we\r\nhardly could get in.\r\n\r\nJansen who was with us asked the host whether our baggage might remain\r\nthere until in the morning for it was so near the river and this was\r\npermitted. In the morning, namely Monday, Jansen went with us to\r\nsecure transportation to Rochester. A lieutenant from Gothenborg told\r\nme that the year before he had talked with many Norwegians nor did\r\nJansen know where the Norwegians had located up through the country,\r\nbut he knew they had gone that way. Now we went to the office and\r\nJansen secured transportation for us to the above Rochester, he then\r\nwent with us to the house where the baggage was and got it brought to\r\nthe office about 5 o’clock in the afternoon, when the steamer was to\r\nleave; afterwards he went with us to some money changers to get our\r\nmoney changed into silver for the Swedish Consul from whom we were to\r\nhave our money in Falreva as above stated, he cheated us a little; we\r\nshould have had silver and got nothing else than paper money and these\r\nwe had to have changed again for they would not be accepted up in the\r\ncountry. I will state that there are many difficulties with money\r\nhere; there is an innumerable number of banks and the money isn’t\r\npassed more than in the bank’s district; some of these (banks) are\r\nweak so that it is difficult to receive money with which one is not\r\nacquainted; all paper passes for the same as silver but people very\r\nmuch prefer silver. Jansen and the other Norwegians we met frightened\r\nus very much and said we must not go farther before we changed our\r\nmoney to silver and so said Jansen went with us to get our money\r\nchanged. We came in to one and Jansen asked him how much he took in\r\npercentage. He wanted 18 per cent and Jansen said we should take\r\nsilver. He changed 40 spd in silver and the rest in pamper which I had\r\nto give 2 per cent for and when we considered the matter all this was\r\nto no use for there would be banks and exchange houses wherever we\r\nhappened to stop; but this I could not think of until it was too late\r\nbut Ansteen didn’t change his money but it was Jansen’s fault that I\r\ngave this money in exchange. We went to another broker and asked him\r\nhow much he wanted in exchange. He said 12 per cent; then I found out\r\nhow I had exchanged my money, and for paper money he didn’t take any\r\nper cent. Ansteen exchanged his money for paper but didn’t take any\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nNow I must write something about New York City, but which is almost\r\nindescribable. Jansen went with us in many streets to show us some of\r\nthe splendid things in the city. All the streets in which we walked\r\nwere nothing but stores right through the buildings, yes, so large\r\nthat we could not see the end of them and was packed as closely as\r\npossible with all kinds of goods. Yes, likewise on the streets and\r\nbuildings were all kinds of clothing, besides drawings and pictures of\r\nmen, horses, and all kinds of animals in their full shape so we did\r\nnot know but that they were alive; and the buildings were 5 and 6\r\nstories high. But navigation was still more to be looked at with all\r\nthe ships that lay here which I guarantee were in the thousands and an\r\nimmense number so large that the largest I have seen in Norway were\r\nalmost like yachts in comparison with these and they looked as if they\r\nwere cast in a mold. Likewise were steamboats of which there surely\r\nwere hundreds here and many which went only across the river with\r\npassengers so that one could go to the wharf whenever he pleased and\r\nthere stood passage ready. In the city was also a street which stood\r\nfull the whole day with horses and wagons only to be hired by anybody\r\nthat wanted them. I will also tell how it was with passage on the\r\nsteamboat. Here there is no question about getting passage but who\r\never wants to can get his baggage and go on board and not speak to\r\nanybody. This one can do no matter what country he is from; for there\r\nis never a question about passports and the pay is collected on board\r\nand tickets given until one goes ashore which are then to be returned.\r\nMonday, the 19th of June, 5 o’clock in the afternoon, we went on board\r\nthe steamboat in New York for Albany which is 161 miles and arrived\r\nthere in the morning; there we did not understand a single person nor\r\ndid we meet anybody that we could talk with. When we were to go ashore\r\nthere we did not know where we were to go; but we had a ticket from\r\nthe office in New York that we were to have free passage to Rochester,\r\nthis we exhibited and were instructed accordingly. There came a man\r\nwith horse and cart on which we were to place our baggage; he drove us\r\nto an office and said we should stop until the office was opened and\r\nthen we should show our tickets, that we understood. Soon the office\r\nwas open and we went in with our tickets which they took and kept and\r\nwrote one for us instead. I asked the office man what time the boat\r\nwould go again; but although each one of us spoke his own tongue, I\r\ncould understand that it was not to go before in the afternoon. Now we\r\nwalked about in the city to see the sights and there we saw many\r\nstrange things; among other things we saw a great tower which looked\r\nas if it were made of pure gold and we saw the glitter of this tower\r\nout on the river before we came to the city. We went to this tower to\r\nlook at it; when we came near to it we could see that it was plated\r\nwith brass but this must have been gilt otherwise it would fade. A\r\nsomewhat smaller tower glittered like silver plated with tin; likewise\r\nI have in America in several cities seen many houses with roofs of\r\ntin. Here we also were permitted to examine the house where the steam\r\ncars are kept. From there we saw that they drove the cars with horses\r\nand 2 cars for each horse until they came some distance from the city\r\nwhere the engine itself received them and which hauled 20 cars at a\r\ntime, even if all were filled with freight. This railroad went over\r\nthe Philadelphia but the length of it I do not know.--Now I am going\r\nto report something that I have neglected, namely: when we had come on\r\nboard the steamboat in Provedens, and just as we left the shore we saw\r\nan engine go from the carhouse and draw 10 cars with it and all were\r\nfilled with people; this we stood on the deck and saw; it went to the\r\ncity of Boston.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we went on board on the canal boat here in Albany.\r\nThese boats are all the same size. They are about 30 ells long and 5\r\nells wide with room for freight in the center and a cabin in each end\r\nwith costly curtains in the windows and painted floor with carpets on;\r\nthe other furniture in the rooms were for the most part polished.\r\n\r\nAt the first start of the canal boat they pushed this forward with\r\npoles a little ways up the locks, that is, a dam which the boat went\r\nup; above the lock there was built a large dam in which the boat was\r\nturned around and under a house. Now one of the locks was closed and\r\nthe water tapped off so that the boat stood dry on some beams; there\r\nwas an arrangement whereby the boat was weighed with the cargo in,\r\nexcepting the people that went ashore; when this was done the lock was\r\nopened and the boat floated and went back. From there it was taken\r\nwith 2 horses and hauled all the way to Buffalo. With wonderment we\r\nlooked at the works on this canal especially the locks which were 85\r\nin number and between 5 and 6 ells high and all of cut marble, and a\r\nlarge part of the finest white marble. Along the canal there is an\r\nimmense number of cities which are lately founded; but I do not know\r\nthe name of them because I did not understand English. With wonderment\r\nwe saw near a little town a large steep hill which was covered with\r\nrailroads for steam cars. Yes, there went one railroad which could not\r\nescape this hill and there for the first time we saw many cars hooked\r\ntogether which came down the hill without both horses and engines,\r\nthat we could see; when they came down they were taken with horses;\r\nlikewise when the horses came to the hill from below with the car many\r\nwere hooked together and went up the hill of their own accord.\r\n\r\nErik Hougen, from Thiin, stated that he took a ride on a steam car\r\nfrom Albany, a distance upward which hauled 18 cars full of people;\r\nbut when they came to such a hill he said, the engine let go of them\r\nand the other cars went down the hill by themselves; in the middle of\r\nthe hill they met a car with an awfully large load of stones which\r\nwent up on the other track. I did not see any engine that pulled but\r\nby the side of the load was a big iron beam which went on cushions.\r\nThis was probably the machine. Perhaps this was in the same hill on\r\nwhich we saw the cars go.\r\n\r\nIn Rochester we had heard it said that there were Norwegians there;\r\nthither we came one morning early and went ashore and looked about in\r\nthe city. Ansteen now met a man that had arrived a year before; this\r\nman was going to work so he did not get to talk much with him; he\r\ndirected us to where we might meet one who had been there a few years\r\nbut him we did not meet. While we went there and waited we met a man\r\nby a bridge who was from Faaloino in Stavanger County and had come\r\nover the year before. He told us where the Norwegians had located in\r\nthe west, namely, in the State of Illinois, which was over 1000 miles\r\nfrom Buffalo. He told us that the Norwegians who had come to Illinois\r\nhad written to them how it was there, that a plain laborer could get\r\nfrom 1 to 1½ dollars per day and afterwards about the tradesmen, how\r\nmuch they could get according to their kind; he said, “if you have so\r\nmuch money that you can get there, you should not stop before you get\r\nthere; if I had so much money I would go tomorrow,” said he. He went\r\nwith us into a merchant he was acquainted with and asked if our money\r\nwas good enough; but he said that it did not pass in Illinois and if\r\nthey desired would exchange it without any per cent. That was very\r\ngood for there we got Illinois money; yes, we got some silver too in\r\nplace of paper.--The above mentioned man told us that the canal was\r\ndamaged and that we must not make contract with the captain farther\r\nthan there for the time being. Now, we parted with pleasure from this\r\nman and betook us on the journey to Buffalo, which is 100 miles from\r\nRochester.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the break in the canal referred to above we got on to\r\nanother boat; a lot of people came on board which were from Bavaria in\r\nGermany, and some French; there was certainly 100 of them and all were\r\npeasants; and all their male persons had blue linen shirts outside of\r\ntheir clothes with large pockets on them which hung outside and many\r\nwore caps which fitted close to the head.--These people all had to be\r\nin the freight room; but we were allowed to be in the front room with\r\nsome Scotchmen with whom we were in company from Albany; these were\r\nmostly young people of both sexes but very good-natured and jolly with\r\nsinging and other entertainment; we got so acquainted with these as if\r\nwe were the best friends at home, but we did not understand each\r\nothers’ talk. When we came to Buffalo, which is the end of the canal,\r\nwe had to go from there on steamboat to Detroit; from Buffalo the\r\nScotchmen secured passage for us just as for themselves but some of\r\nthem parted with us there.--In Buffalo we first saw Indians; that is,\r\nthe original Americans who live about like the Lapps in Norway and\r\nsubsist on hunting and without houses; but have tents which they move\r\nfrom one place to another. Those we saw there we could notice were\r\nwomen; we came first into a merchant where one stood and talked with\r\nhim; when she went out we asked him what kind of a person that was; he\r\nanswered it was an Indian; but we did not yet understand what that\r\nmeant.--Their clothes consist of trousers on each hip which extend\r\nfrom the upper part of the hip with a belt around the waist and a\r\nstrap from the trouser hips up to it besides a shirt above which\r\nextends down to the hip, that is the underwear; outside they have a\r\nsort of blanket which consists of white, blue, and colored stripes\r\nwhich they hang over the head and which reaches down on the legs and\r\nthis they hold around themselves with their hands; on their feet they\r\nhave shoes of skin which are fitted tight to the feet and no socks but\r\nthe women have the most beautiful etchings outside of their trousers\r\nand some of them wear much of gold and silver ornaments.\r\n\r\nNow we went on the steamboat in company with these Scotchmen in\r\nBuffalo which went to Detroit over the Erie Lake which is a fresh\r\nwater and which is so large that we could not see land only on one\r\nside; but when we came to Detroit we did not know where to go; but 2\r\ncarpenters of these Scotchmen said that they were going to Schicago,\r\nthe same place as we were going to. We went with them to the boarding\r\nhouse; I at once went out and down on the wharf to look around; on the\r\nstreet I met one of the Norwegians who had gone out from Bergen the\r\n7th of April this year. When I came to talk with him he related that\r\nthere were about 80 persons in the company who were bound for Schicago\r\nand they had been staying here for 5 days and had not got passage but\r\nafter 2 days they were to get passage. Now we took leave of these\r\nScotchmen and went to our fellow countrymen with whom we have kept\r\ncompany from that time on. In Detroit we had to pay 10 dollars apiece\r\nto Schicago, which is 700 miles, which also was fresh water. On this\r\nsteamboat were such a great number of passengers that we could hardly\r\nsit down. The sailors and others were so thievish that we could\r\nscarcely keep our baggage; yes, a part of it they took from us.\r\n\r\nThey went into a city to take wood (fuel), the name of it I do not\r\nremember but there was a fort. Here we got to see plenty of Indians;\r\nwhen we got ashore there was on the pier a whole lot of Indians. Among\r\nthem was one who was said to be captain who was very grand in clothes\r\nand a big silver ring in the nose, which was fastened to the middle\r\nwing of the nose. In the ears there was a sheaf of silver blocks and\r\nthey had silk bands in the ears in which these ornaments were hung;\r\nyes, many more had such things. One had 3 tassels in the ear and 30 of\r\nthe above blocks in each tassel but there was only one with a ring in\r\nthe nose. At the knees they had wound pretty bands that were\r\nembroidered with small beads and were very pretty and a whole tassel\r\nthat hung down to the foot which was embroidered with beads; that is\r\nthe costume of the menfolks. Some of the women had gold rings on the\r\nfingers almost as many as they had room for. On one we counted them\r\nand she had 44 gold rings on her hands. Another had covered the\r\nbreasts and over the shoulder with smooth silver brooches as closely\r\nas possible. Their complexion is for the most part soot-brown or\r\nbrown-black with broad faces, without beard and long black hair. Some\r\nof them had painted themselves with red, blue, and black stripes\r\nacross the faces, which was to mean that they would be manly in strife\r\nif anybody attacked them. These people are very curious to look at,\r\nstill they look fierce; but they are said to be very good-natured and\r\na separate language they have. After we entered the city called\r\nGronbay (Green Bay), there were also some Indians. There lay a\r\ngarrison of warriors, which they said was to be for the Indians if\r\nthey should break in and make an attack. In this garrison they wanted\r\nmore men which they enlisted for 3 years and would give 50 dollars in\r\nenlistment money and then 6 dollars a month and free board and\r\nclothing and not much drill but good learning do they get there. On a\r\nSunday we came to Schicago; when we came ashore there came Norwegians\r\nto talk with us but the most of them talked unfavorably of the\r\ncondition there. Some of the Norwegians, especially the women, let\r\nthemselves be frightened; but when we had made some investigation it\r\nwas not true. Many got into great distress when they heard that there\r\nwas not free land to be had. Yes, a Norwegian from Stavanger County\r\nhad lately been up in the country but could not hear of any, he said\r\nand insisted that it was much worse than in Norway, but he was a big\r\ntalker and probably also a big liar.\r\n\r\nWhen we had remained here in the city a couple of days we learned that\r\n50 miles south from here there was free land. Now, it was resolved\r\nthat some men should go there and examine and the others should remain\r\nin the city and that everyone that wanted land should help pay for\r\nthis journey, whereupon one was hired to take them with team. Those\r\nthat were chosen to go was Candidate Rynning, from Sneaasen, near\r\nTronhjem, 2 men from Bergen’s Stift and I. When we came there we found\r\nthat the land was poor but it was resolved that we should remain\r\nthere. Now, 2 men were to stay to build a shanty to live in when the\r\npeople got there and the lot fell to me and one from Etne Sogn.--When\r\nthe people got there we got much abuse because the land was not good\r\nbut when we had hunted a few days all were satisfied except those who\r\nnever can be satisfied. The most of us located near a creek which is\r\ncalled Baeverkrek (Beaver Creek) and there we took a piece of land\r\neach and are now very well contented therewith if we are able to keep\r\nit and pay for it. Here the land is so free that whatever nation that\r\ncomes can locate without asking anybody’s leave until the land becomes\r\nsold and that is determined by the government; but here there is much\r\ntrading among people with free land. Here we have now been 2 months\r\nand built a fine house with rooms in and now we are going away to\r\nlearn the language and to get some work whereby we can earn money.\r\nHalsteen Flose separated from us in Schicago and went in company with\r\nseveral westward in Illinois to get work; we soon got the report from\r\nthem that they all got work and earned 1½ dollars a day besides free\r\nkeep.--On our journey we have been in intercourse with people almost\r\nfrom all European lands, yes, original Americans and negroes. I have\r\nheard that these people have many different religious sects but one\r\ncannot see any great difference in their manner of living for they are\r\npolite and friendly toward each other. But among the people which I\r\nhave seen that from the first I saw them seemed to be so horrible;\r\nthey are the black negroes with wool-curly hair and I had no desire to\r\nlook at them. But when I now for some time had been in intercourse\r\nwith them I thought they were the most lovable and jolly people I ever\r\nhave seen; wherever I see them they are all equally jolly,\r\ngood-natured and polite, so that I do not think anybody equal to them\r\nin manners. The Indians on the other hand are the most horrible people\r\nI have seen.\r\n\r\nAmong other stories I will also report that first mate Malgren from\r\nGothenborg told me of some curious things which he had seen in\r\nPhiladelphia. There was namely a fountain which was built and taken\r\nout 6 English miles above the city and there it was pumped 600 feet\r\nhigh from the river which was done with an engine so light that one\r\nman could operate it up to 2 large dams which contained an immense\r\nquantity of water. From there it went in iron pipes down to the city\r\nwhere it was distributed in all streets so that they had spring water\r\nnearly in every house; yes, it went up in the 4th and 5th stories in\r\nthe houses. At all corners and single streets there were large\r\nfountains and hydrants where they put on the water hose when fire\r\nbreaks out in the city. There are certainly 60 of that kind of hose\r\nwhich were of bright brass as well polished that one could hardly look\r\nat them on account of the brilliancy. He said they were indescribably\r\ngood and that they never could burn more than one house, no matter how\r\nfierce the fire had broke out for these hose struck nearly through the\r\nhouses, such force had they.\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned canal, namely from Albany to Buffalo, I have now\r\ngotten knowledge of that it was first planned and begun to be worked\r\non in the year 1817 and in 1827 it was ready to be traveled on in a\r\ndistance of 60 Norwegian miles and cost 9 millions.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1836 work was begun on a canal which is to go from\r\nSchicago to the Mississippi River and which will be 150 miles, that is\r\n26 Norwegian miles. When this is finished one will be able to go by\r\nwater from New York to New Orleans which is 3500 English miles,\r\nwhereby one passes, rivers, canals, and fresh water. Likewise there\r\nare built tracks for steam cars from Philadelphia nearly to Schicago.\r\nNext summer there is to be built a railroad which is to go from the\r\none that comes from Philadelphia to Vaabais [Wabash], a river which\r\nempties into the Mississippi and of this railway it is said that it\r\nshall go across the Mississippi and clear across America even to the\r\nPacific Ocean. Here we may see there are good institutions and as land\r\nbecomes settled it becomes supplied with canals and railroads\r\neverywhere, so that like a bird one can travel both by land and by\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn regard to religious sects there are great diversity and I have as\r\nyet but little understanding of their teachings; but so far as I\r\nunderstand they nearly all believe in one single, true God, and it\r\nlooks as if the government took much interest in a good religion. I\r\nhave examined many school books and so far as I understand, the\r\nprinciples are the same as in Norway. There have been inserted in the\r\nnewspapers many examples as warnings for the people that they ought to\r\nlive righteously and pleasing to God. Yes, also in the almanac these\r\nthings are inserted, yes, and everywhere are many warnings in regard\r\nto drunkenness and it is the greatest foolishness that a man does to\r\ndrink liquor, which it certainly also is. In Norway people are urged\r\nand forced to drink liquor but so it is not here, for here the people\r\nare induced by warnings to moderation; and when a man accepts these\r\nwarnings and reports it to his friends who also will be the same,\r\nnamely never either drink or treat liquor, and thereby can many and\r\nlarge societies be freed from this vice.\r\n\r\nA short story of the formation of the country.\r\n\r\nWhen one goes from New York up through the country, it is a perfectly\r\ndry, stony field, but quite well wooded and the soil becomes better\r\nand better and everywhere fruitful. In the State of New York it is\r\nquite mountainous in some places but in the State of Michigan it is\r\nflat and level, besides wooded everywhere until one reaches the State\r\nof Illinois. Here the land looks like the ocean after a storm when the\r\nhuge billows are rolling. Here there is timber enough some places, as\r\nalong rivers and other places; other places timber stands in thick\r\ngroves where people have settled. For the rest there are only rolling\r\nplains which are called prairies and these are everywhere overgrown\r\nwith grass and are for the most part as the best cultivated farms in\r\nNorway. These prairies one can plow and seed with what you please\r\nwhich there grows abundantly without being fertilized. Here the best\r\ntimber land has been taken, but it pays well to till the soil here,\r\nthat I can see. The man that I now have been with and worked for, has\r\n160 acres land fenced in and from this piece certainly has a crop for\r\nover 3000 dollars, although certainly 40 acres are not seeded; they\r\nhave little work with planting. 160 acres costs 200 dollars to buy but\r\nit costs more to get it fenced in. The size of one acre is 208 feet on\r\neach side.\r\n\r\nMr. Bekvald, the man I have been with this winter, told me that if one\r\ngoes from east to west one always has the best land before him.\r\nHitherto the people have moved east, namely to here; but now they are\r\nmoving from here more and more to the west where it is also said to be\r\nbetter, although here it looks like being the best land that anyone\r\ncan desire; but I also have in my mind to go more to the west to look\r\nfor land.\r\n\r\nI will also relate that I have been with a man and worked this winter\r\nfrom the 14th of October to the present day and I have earned 50\r\ndollars in a period of 4 months, in spite of the fact that I did not\r\nknow the language the least when I came there. Some said to me that I\r\ndid work for 20 dollars a month. I have done heavy work and the same\r\nman has offered me 190 dollars for a year and the best keep that any\r\nofficial can get in Norway. It is my opinion that everyone who has his\r\nyouth and is unmarried certainly can make up his mind in regard to the\r\njourney; but one must consider that he is leaving his home and his\r\nrelatives and friends. I have heard many, especially among the women,\r\nsay that if they have ever so good days, they are homesick for Norway.\r\nEveryone that starts on the journey must consider that one must first\r\ntaste sour before he can drink sweet. It is difficult here when one\r\ndoes not understand the language and it is worse when he is unable to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nI will also report how big day’s wages the workingman gets here. A\r\nlaborer can get from 12 to 16 dollars a month in the winter and in the\r\nsummer nearly the double. The price is some places more and some\r\nplaces less. A girl can get from 1 to 2 dollars a week as soon as they\r\nhave some knowledge of the language.\r\n\r\n     Baeverkrek in Illinois, the 21st of February, 1838.\r\n     Ole Knudsen Nattestad.\r\n\r\nPostscript: More have I not time to write this time; but this\r\ndescription of travel I send home to you, my relatives and friends! if\r\nyou have desire to read herein about what I on my long journey have\r\nexperienced and seen since I was at home with you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITORIALS\r\n\r\nHISTORY REPEATS ITSELF\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery twenty-five years, on the average, the American nation has waged\r\nwar with an important civilized power. Again, as on previous occasions\r\nwe find ourselves involved in a great struggle, on the outcome of\r\nwhich our existence as an independent nation probably depends, with\r\npractically no preparation having been made in advance to meet the\r\nissue. Not to go further back than 1914, for three years the nation\r\ngamboled on the brink of war, making practically no effort to prepare\r\nfor the struggle the imminence of which was apparent to every\r\nreasoning person. As we write these lines the daily paper brings to\r\nour desk a story from the Secretary of War, intended to be thrilling,\r\nof how, after war was declared, an airplane engine was devised for\r\nadoption by our government. America was the original home of the\r\naeroplane, yet we began the present war as little equipped, to all\r\npractical purposes, to wage it in the air as were our forefathers of\r\n1776.\r\n\r\nThis is but typical of our situation as a whole. When war was declared\r\nwe had ample potential resources in men, material, and initiative, but\r\nwe had no army and only an inadequate navy; and while these are being\r\nevolved at a prodigious expenditure of labor and money, the enemy is\r\nkept from our gates by virtue of no foresight of ours, but rather by\r\nthe good fortune which has given us powerful allies whose armies and\r\nnavies are fighting in our behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MILITARY RECORD\r\n\r\nThus has it ever been when America went to war. The pages of our\r\nhistory teem with disasters for which our happy-go-lucky attitude\r\ntoward all things military is responsible. Curiously enough, in the\r\nvery face of such a record, flourishes a popular conviction that the\r\nhistory of our warfare is one of triumph succeeding triumph with\r\nmonotonous regularity; and that with respect to our armies, if in no\r\nother thing, America has far excelled the other peoples of the earth.\r\nThat this is all a ghastly illusion any one who has access to a\r\nrespectable library can quickly satisfy himself. The simple truth is\r\nthat our past military record has been far from extraordinary; that\r\nAmericans considered as individuals are no braver than other people;\r\nand that when these individuals are associated in armies they require\r\nmuch the same degree of organization, equipment, and leadership as\r\nother armies do, if the record they make is to constitute pleasant\r\nreading for the nation that sends them forth to war.\r\n\r\nIt behooves us to note in this connection that no other type of human\r\nactivity calls for so high a degree of organization and discipline as\r\ndoes the waging of civilized war; and further, that as a consequence\r\nof the industrial development of the last century the handicap of a\r\nnation which is unprepared to defend itself, in a contest with one\r\nwhich has thus prepared, is vastly greater than ever before. The\r\nancient Gauls and Germans were able to wage a respectable fight\r\nagainst so mighty a military machine as the legions of Julius Caesar,\r\nand on one notable occasion, a few years later, a great imperial army\r\nwas utterly destroyed by the forest barbarians. In modern times the\r\nsmall armies of England have marched at will over Africa, and the\r\nfanatic bravery of the tribesmen has led to no other result than their\r\nmore certain and speedy slaughter at the hands of their civilized\r\nfoemen. Returning to our own history, the American militiaman of\r\nRevolutionary days was no match for the British regular; and, popular\r\nbelief to the contrary, the naval War of 1812 was not won by America.\r\nEven were the contrary the case, however, it would avail us nothing at\r\nthe present time, for the art of warfare and the circumstances of\r\nhuman life have alike undergone a complete revolution during the last\r\nhundred years. Mr. Bryan’s fanciful vision of a million men springing\r\nto arms at the first note of danger is but an empty myth, but\r\nunfortunately it is by no means a harmless one. The nation which\r\nneglects to set its defenses in order in advance of the emergency is,\r\nunder modern conditions, doomed to defeat before war shall have been\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT OF THE FUTURE?\r\n\r\nBut what avail, it may be asked, is it to dwell upon our past military\r\nmistakes? None, certainly, unless we are capable as a people of\r\nprofiting by the school of experience. Thus far, in the matter under\r\ndiscussion, our national good luck, inducing, as it has done, a quite\r\nunwarranted feeling of security, has prevented us from doing so. That\r\nwe are permanently incapacitated from guiding our feet by the lamp of\r\nexperience, however, the writer at least does not believe. To a\r\nlimited extent, indeed, in the conduct of the present war, we have\r\nalready evinced a willingness to avoid repeating our past mistakes.\r\nThe question of preparation in advance of the conflict aside, the\r\npreliminary stage of the current war has been waged in materially\r\nbetter fashion than has that of any of our previous wars. In\r\nparticular the principle of universal liability to service has been\r\nadopted and an earnest effort has been made to provide as officers,\r\nmen who combine with a high degree of natural capacity at least a\r\nmodicum of training for the work intrusted to their charge.\r\n\r\nThese things are well enough in their way, and encouraging as\r\nindicative of the development of a more intelligent attitude on the\r\npart of our people toward the conduct of the military arm of the\r\ngovernment. No longer, apparently, can a runaway boy of sixteen\r\nconvince a secretary of war, as in the old days, that his desire for a\r\ncommission in the army entitles him to precedence over graduates of\r\nWest Point; nor will we again witness the spectacle of our president\r\nappointing all the officers of a newly-created military unit direct\r\nfrom civil life on the ground that the country “generally expected”\r\nour trained soldiers should thus be ignored. However gratifying this\r\nmay be, the nub of the present situation lies in the fact that\r\nwhatever has been done thus far has been with a view solely to meeting\r\na present emergency. The country has not determined upon, and the\r\ngovernment has not adopted any permanent or general policy. Sooner or\r\nlater the present war will end. Shall we then, as in 1815 and 1865,\r\ndisband our military force and have recourse once more to the old\r\npolicy of trusting to Providence for the protection of our liberty and\r\nour existence as a nation? Or shall we now highly resolve that the\r\ndestinies of the American people are too precious, that the success of\r\nour great experiment in democracy is charged with too much importance,\r\nnot alone to ourselves but to the remainder of mankind as well, to\r\njustify us in leaving it absolutely unprotected in a world of\r\npotential enemies? What would be thought today of a city which should\r\nmaintain no police department, and for protection against fire should\r\ndepend upon the unorganized efforts of volunteers? Scarcely two\r\ncenturies ago, however, even the chief city of the world had no police\r\ndepartment, while within the memory of men now living our cities\r\ndepended upon volunteers for protection against fire.\r\n\r\nIn these matters the obvious lesson of experience has been thoroughly\r\nlearned. Professional police and fire departments are the standing\r\narmies of our cities, highly organized and constantly alert to protect\r\nthem from the perils of disorder and fire. The American people will\r\nnot permanently be content to display a lower order of intelligence in\r\nnational affairs than it does in those of merely municipal concern.\r\nToo long, however, have we confided the protection of our national\r\nexistence to Providence. We believe it to be the duty of every citizen\r\nto exert the full measure of his influence upon his governmental\r\nrepresentatives to the end that now, before national disaster shall\r\nhave overtaken us, a permanent military policy adequate to our\r\nprotection be adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN APPRECIATION AND A SUGGESTION\r\n\r\nThe September number of the MAGAZINE contained news of the bequest to\r\nthe Society by Miss Genevieve Mills of Madison of her interest in the\r\nparental homestead. We return to the subject now for a twofold reason.\r\nIn the first place it is proper to render adequate formal\r\nacknowledgment of the fine gift made by Miss Mills to the Society. Of\r\nvain or ill-advised memorials to the departed, America affords\r\nnumerous examples; the wisdom and appropriateness of Miss Mills’s\r\nmemorial to her parents appears, by contrast with some of these, all\r\nthe more obvious. Money which might have gone to the building of a\r\nuseless pile of granite has been devoted to the perpetual enrichment\r\nof the commonwealth, to the upbuilding of which Simeon and Maria Mills\r\ndedicated their lives. To illustrate concretely the work which the\r\nMills bequest will perform, the annual income from the estimated value\r\nof the estate will suffice to pay the entire cost of publication of\r\nthis magazine; or it will print annually such a volume as those\r\nincluded in the _Collections_ of the Society. If the cost of\r\nauthorship as well as printing be charged against the fund, it will\r\nsuffice to produce a volume of our _Collections_ every two or three\r\nyears. And this work, without exhausting the principal of the fund, is\r\nto go on perpetually.\r\n\r\nIf the present world war has taught any lesson, it is that of the\r\nvalue to a nation of its civic and patriotic ideals. But these cannot\r\nbe cultivated unless due regard be paid to the preservation and study\r\nof the country’s historical records. Thus Miss Mills’s bequest\r\nconstitutes a permanent factor making for the development of\r\npatriotism in our commonwealth. Well would it be if all givers of\r\nfunds for a public purpose should display equal wisdom. At the present\r\ntime, we understand, the Norwegians of Wisconsin are contemplating the\r\nerection of an expensive memorial to Colonel Heg of the Fifteenth\r\nWisconsin Infantry, the famed Norwegian regiment. That Colonel Heg\r\nrichly deserves a suitable memorial no one will be disposed to\r\ndispute. The establishment of a perpetual fund, the income of which\r\nshould be devoted to the study of the Norwegian contribution to\r\nWisconsin and American history, would constitute, we respectfully\r\nsuggest, a more useful and suitable memorial to Colonel Heg than any\r\nbronze or granite pile, however costly it may be.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNON FODDER\r\n\r\nHe slipped into the office with a quiet apology for the intrusion, to\r\nsay that he had enlisted in the naval reserve. Not expecting to be\r\ncalled for a month or more, the call to service had come immediately.\r\nHis only concern over this was due to the fact that he must leave the\r\nLibrary on such short notice, and he was distressed to think that his\r\nleaving thus might inconvenience those who remained behind. Two years\r\nago he had entered our employ, in the hope that proximity to the\r\nUniversity would render it possible, while earning his living, to take\r\npart-time work on the hill. So thorough was his industry that before\r\nlong, aside from his full-time employment (with service faithfully\r\nrendered), he was carrying two-thirds of normal undergraduate work.\r\nHow he carried it is indicated by the fact that, though preparing\r\nhimself for an engineer, he was prevented from winning the annual\r\nprize for excellence in English composition only by virtue of the\r\nlimitation of the award to students doing full-time work.\r\n\r\nThus the Library lost a faithful worker; thus the nation gained an\r\nexcellent soldier. Of such stuff are the men of our new army made.\r\nUnless we mistake greatly, the German nation will live to rue the\r\ncourse by which its government goaded the American people to the point\r\nof taking active part in settling the great question whether autocracy\r\nor democracy shall perish. Quietly and without heroics our splendid\r\nyouth have appraised the situation, and having appraised it, with a\r\nsmile have offered themselves and their hopeful futures upon the altar\r\nof human freedom, only regretting as did our particular hero, the\r\ninconvenience to others which their sacrifice may involve. We will not\r\noffend his modesty by placing his name in type. To him and all his\r\nkind we offer a reverent Godspeed. The nobility of their offering is\r\ninspiring enough; that it should have been necessary in the full light\r\nof the twentieth century is one of the ghastliest facts in human\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE QUESTION BOX\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | _The Wisconsin Historical Library has long maintained a       |\r\n  | bureau of historical information for the benefit of those who |\r\n  | care to avail themselves of the service it offers.

It would be interesting to know just how much money\r\n     Daniel Webster gave for lots in Madison, for lands\r\n     throughout this state and Iowa, for capital stock in the\r\n     railway company from LaFontaine and what the evidence of\r\n     such payment is. Not that I am disposed to charge the\r\n     godlike Daniel with graft, at least no more than his\r\n     associates and compeers were chargeable with at that period.\r\n\r\n                                       W. A. P. MORRIS,\r\n                                      _Madison, Wisconsin_.\r\n\r\nSo far as we can ascertain, Webster’s investments, or speculations, in\r\nWisconsin property were perfectly legitimate and not influenced by\r\npolitical considerations. In his own account thereof, after saying\r\nthat he wished to resign, and was not permitted to do so, he says:\r\n“So, seei’g, then, that I must do something with a view to future\r\nmeans of liv’g I entered on _Western investments_, partly in company\r\nwith Col. Perkins, partly in a company of which Gov. Cass was Chief,\r\nand partly on my own account. These investments were made by faithful\r\n& careful agents, principally in agricultural lands of excellent\r\nquality, in Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, & Wisconsin. Prospects of profit\r\nseemed fair, at the time, & I purchased as far as means & credit would\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Wallace Jones, in his _Autobiography_, tells of walking along a\r\nstreet in Washington soon lafter the erection of Wisconsin Territory,\r\nof which he was congressional delegate. Webster overtook him, invited\r\nhim to his house, and entered into conversation with him on the\r\nsubject of investments. Jones became one of Webster’s agents. In\r\ncooperation with Webster he made about $20,000 and Webster sold his\r\nholdings to the United States bank of Philadelphia for $50,000. Jones\r\nstates that Webster owed him $15,000 when he died, but as he had made\r\na good thing by him, he never pressed the debt.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Madison investment, the amount should be $3,000 and\r\nnot $5,000 (this was a typographical error). In the biography of Jones\r\nis a reference to a letter dated December 24, 1836 from Judge Doty\r\nspeaking of the association of proprietors for Madison and stating\r\nthat these were twenty-four in number, each of whom paid in $100. By\r\nFebruary, 1837, the dividends on the sales were $170 a share. On the\r\nstrength of this showing, Jones sold his share to Webster for “about\r\n$3,000.”\r\n\r\nThe only thing that looks like political influence is in connection\r\nwith the entries of mineral lands in southwestern Wisconsin. Moses M.\r\nStrong, whose papers are in the Society’s possession, came to\r\nWisconsin in 1836 as the agent of Hon. Henry Hubbard, United States\r\nsenator from New Hampshire, and made large investments for him and\r\nsome of his friends. Part of the entries made by Strong for Hubbard\r\nwere upon reserved mineral lands, which were not open to general\r\nentry, but were leased by the government. Hubbard tried to get some\r\ndecision, the precise nature of which is not evident, from the United\r\nStates land commissioner, concerning these mineral lands, and in the\r\ncourse of his correspondence with Strong he mentions Webster’s name,\r\nand says he will see the commissioner. There is no evidence that this\r\nwas in any way an improper proceeding or influence.\r\n\r\nAs George W. Jones was Webster’s agent in southwestern Wisconsin,\r\nMorgan L. Martin seems to have been his agent in the eastern part of\r\nthe state. In the early part of 1837 Martin went east to be married\r\nand incidentally arranged what business he could. In New York he met\r\nWebster and interested him in the lands along Fox River and upon Lake\r\nWinnebago, describing the projected railroad from La Fontaine, a\r\n“paper” city on Fox River, to Winnebago City, another of like\r\nimportance on the northeastern shore of Lake Winnebago. This railroad,\r\nif built, would have been thirteen miles in length, and was planned to\r\ntransport freight around the Winnebago Rapids at what is now Neenah.\r\nThis La Fontaine Railroad Company was the first in the Territory to\r\nsecure a charter, which was granted by the legislature at Belmont,\r\nDecember 3, 1836. Martin succeeded in firing the imagination of\r\nWebster by his description of the importance of the Fox-Wisconsin\r\nwaterway, and March 24, 1837, Webster wrote him from New York to\r\ninvest $5,000 in the stock of the railroad (Wisconsin Mss. 5C83). June\r\n28, 1837 Martin replied (_Ibid_, 110) saying that the capital stock\r\nwas $50,000 “of which we do not think it necessary to call in over\r\none-half. Doty took 20. I put you down for 10 & took the balance\r\nmyself. I conceived you would prefer that amount since it would only\r\nrequire to be paid the sum for which you authorize me to draw on you.”\r\nMartin goes on to discuss the liberal terms of the charter, which they\r\nwere planning to have amended by still more liberal provisions at the\r\nnext legislature. He discusses land grants along the right of way. The\r\nengineer they expect has not yet arrived. He closes with a cordial\r\ninvitation to Webster to visit Green Bay and be his guest.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation seems to have ended at this point. The panic of 1837\r\ncame on and Martin was badly hampered by his connections with the bank\r\nof Green Bay and by his large speculative enterprises. No action was\r\never taken on the railway charter, and in all probability Webster was\r\nnever called upon for his subscription to the company’s stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [95] This contained a short article on “Daniel Webster a\r\n     Wisconsin Investor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     NAMES PROPOSED FOR A NEW TOWN\r\n\r\n     We would appreciate it if you would let us know where we can\r\n     get some information relative to the early history of\r\n     Wisconsin, especially that part of the state through which\r\n     the Chippewa River flows. We would like to get the names of\r\n     some early explorers and Indian chiefs that make a part of\r\n     the history of Sawyer County. Or, could you give us a number\r\n     of names that you think would be typical of the region\r\n     referred to that would make a good name for a small village?\r\n\r\n                            WISCONSIN COLONIZATION COMPANY,\r\n                               _Eau Claire, Wisconsin_.\r\n\r\nWe have looked somewhat into the matter suggested in your letter of\r\nMay 17 and have the following suggestions to make in connection with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFirst, since Sawyer County is drained by the Chippewa River, and since\r\nthe first person of the English race who is known to have visited that\r\nregion was the famous traveler, Jonathan Carver, the name Carver would\r\nseem to be an appropriate one for the village you have in mind.\r\n\r\nSecond, the first resident fur traders of Sawyer County were the\r\nWarren brothers and John Baptiste Corbin. Either Warren or Corbin\r\nwould seem to us to make a good name for the town. Either name would\r\nalso be easy to spell and sufficiently euphonious.\r\n\r\nThird, if an Indian name is desired, the first important Chippewa\r\nchief of this region was Sha-da-wish. Among his descendants were\r\nKa-ka-ke, Labudee, Mon-so-ne, and Ke-dug-a-be-shew. The last two names\r\nmentioned mean respectively moose tail and spotted lynx.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ORIGIN OF THE WORD “WINNEQUAH”\r\n\r\n     Can you give me any information concerning the origin and\r\n     historical significance of the name “Winnequah,” applied to\r\n     the point projecting into Lake Monona?\r\n\r\n                                     FREDERICK BRANDENBURG,\r\n                                     _Madison, Wisconsin_.\r\n\r\nThe site of Winnequah was originally known as Strawberry Point, Squaw\r\nPoint, Old Indian Garden, and Wood’s Point. It was the village home\r\nfor the Lake Monona Winnebago, and when Madison was first built it was\r\noccupied by Abraham Wood, who had a Winnebago chief’s daughter for his\r\nsquaw. She was one of the illustrious family of Decorah, and her\r\nfather was chief of the band in the vicinity of Portage. In 1835\r\nWilliam B. Long and Abraham Wood entered the fifty-two acres of the\r\npoint in the Mineral Point land office, and three years later, March\r\n24, 1838, transferred their interest to Col. William B. Slaughter.\r\nAfter this transaction Wood moved to Poynette. Slaughter kept the land\r\nas an investment. Thomas B. Sutherland, one of the founders of the\r\nState Historical Society, was wont to relate his experiences as\r\nsurveyor in 1835 when he spent some time at the Indian village at\r\nStrawberry Point. The name “Winnequah” was bestowed upon the point\r\nsome time in the late sixties by Capt. Francis (Frank) Barnes who ran\r\na steamboat line on Lake Monona. Barnes had a fancy for odd names; one\r\nof his boats was named the “Scutanaubequon.” He built a dancing hall\r\non the point and fitted it up for picnic parties and seems to have\r\ninvented the word “Winnequah.” At least, its meaning is not to be\r\nfound among the Winnebago vocabularies, nor is it susceptible of any\r\ninterpretation except that it is made up of Winnebago Squaw Point.\r\nBarnes carried on his steamboat line from 1866 to 1873 or 1874,\r\nperhaps later. The Madison directory for 1877-78 lists him as “captain\r\nof tug.” The owner of Strawberry Point--to revert to its first\r\nname--from 1868 or earlier was N. W. Dean. He seems to have rented or\r\nleased the land to Barnes for his picnic grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE DISCOVERY OF LAKE SUPERIOR\r\n\r\n     In Volume Seven of the _American Nation_ Mr. Thwaites states\r\n     (page 52) that Lake Superior was discovered in 1616. All\r\n     other secondary accounts give 1629. Can you tell me whether\r\n     or not the date 1616 is a misprint? If not where can I get\r\n     the information about its discovery?\r\n\r\n                                        E. G. DOUDNA,\r\n                                   _Eau Claire, Wisconsin_.\r\n\r\nThe dates of the discoveries of the several great lakes are not\r\ndefinitely known, and there is no uniformity of statement concerning\r\ntheir first exploration. Dr. Thwaites’s works reflect this\r\nuncertainty. In the _American Nation_ volume to which you refer he was\r\ninclined to accept the theory of Etienne Brulé’s exploration of Lake\r\nSuperior, and thought it might have occurred after his journey to the\r\nSusquehanna in 1615, and before his return in 1618 to Quebec.\r\nTherefore he gives the date as 1616. In his _Wisconsin_, published in\r\n1908, he appears to have rejected the theory of Brulé’s explorations,\r\nand states that Jean Nicolet in 1634 was probably the discoverer of\r\nLake Superior. In his school _History of the United States_ (Boston,\r\n1912) he shows his doubt by giving “about 1629” as the date of the\r\ndiscovery. Not all secondary accounts give the date as 1629. Our own\r\nopinion is that there is no authority for this date, and that it\r\narises from a misinterpretation of Edward J. Neill’s statement in\r\nJustin Winsor’s _Narrative and Critical History of America_, IV, 165.\r\nOne of the latest histories of the Great Lakes (Channing and Lansing’s\r\n_The Story of the Great Lakes_, New York, 1909) gives no date for the\r\ndiscovery of Lake Superior, but assigns 1610 to the first white man’s\r\nvoyage on Lake Huron, five years earlier than the traditional one of\r\n1615 for Champlain’s first voyage. The whole matter turns on the\r\ncareer of Etienne Brulé, one of the youths selected by Champlain to\r\nreside among the Indians and learn their language. His adventures were\r\nfirst discussed in detail in C. W. Butterfield’s, _Brulé’s\r\nExplorations and Discoveries_ (Cleveland, 1898). A more recent\r\ndiscussion in French, by the eminent Canadian authority Benjamin\r\nSulte, appeared in the Canadian Royal Society _Proceedings and\r\nTransactions_, 3d series, vol. 1, section 1, 97-125. Butterfield and\r\nSulte substantially agree, and both consider that Etienne Brulé with a\r\ncompanion named Grenolle probably visited Lake Superior and explored\r\nit in 1622-23. The evidence is somewhat circumstantial, and the point\r\nmay never be determined; but Champlain must have had some information,\r\naside from that furnished by the Indians, for upon his map of 1632\r\nappears the outline of Lake Superior entering Lake Huron by the “Sault\r\nde Gaston,” as he calls the present Sault Ste. Marie. If one rejects\r\nthe evidence of Brulé’s voyage, which rests upon inference chiefly,\r\nthe date 1629 is the last one in which Champlain could have obtained\r\nhis information for his map published in 1632, since he was deported\r\nby English conquerors from his colony in the former year, and did not\r\nreturn until 1633.\r\n\r\nNext to Brulé must be placed Jean Nicolet, who visited the Sault in\r\n1634; whether he ascended the strait to the lake itself is\r\nconjectural. Then in 1641 came the great gathering of Indians attended\r\nby the Jesuit fathers, Jogues and Raymbault. (See L. P. Kellogg’s\r\n_Early Narratives of the Northwest_, New York, 1917, 19-25). The first\r\ndescription of Lake Superior is given by Pierre Esprit Radisson in his\r\n_Journal_. The probable date of his voyage thereon is 1661, but Father\r\nRené Ménard arrived at Keweenaw Bay in the autumn of 1660.\r\n\r\nIt appears probable that the date of the discovery of Lake Superior\r\ncannot be determined with accuracy, and must remain uncertain unless\r\nscholars accept the conclusions of Butterfield and Sulte concerning\r\nBrulé. The same is true of the discovery of the upper Mississippi; it\r\nhas been claimed for Nicolet in 1634, for Radisson in 1659, for La\r\nSalle in 1669, all antedating the voyage of Jolliet and Marquette in\r\n1673. The truth is that from the beginning of French settlement on the\r\nSt. Lawrence there was much roving to the sources of the great river.\r\nMany of these coureurs des bois were brave and courageous explorers,\r\nbut they kept no records. It is thus dogmatic to say that the visit of\r\nthe first white man to any given point occurred on such or such a\r\ndate. We can only say when the first records were made describing such\r\nan event. The records for the voyage of Brulé and Grenolle in 1622\r\nhave not yet been universally accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE POTAWATOMI DURING THE REVOLUTION: FATHER ALLOUEZ AMONG THE\r\n     KICKAPOO\r\n\r\n     I am sending you some more letters from Quitos. In one of\r\n     these letters he refers to War Chief Thunder fighting with\r\n     George Washington against the Canadians. I would like to\r\n     find out what fight that was. Can you tell me?\r\n\r\n     I would also like to find out whether Fathers Dablon and\r\n     Claude Allouez visited the Kickapoo Indians on Milwaukee\r\n     River in 1670 a few years before Jolliet and Marquette\r\n     discovered the Mississippi. I have seen something to this\r\n     effect somewhere.\r\n\r\n                                             A. GEREND,\r\n                                         _Cato, Wisconsin_.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that the Potawatomi of the west shore of\r\nLake Michigan, notably those of Milwaukee, and probably those farther\r\nnorth, under the influence of Siggenauk or the Blackbird made a treaty\r\nat Cahokia, Illinois, with George Rogers Clark in September, 1778, and\r\nwere thereafter for a time American allies. There was no actual\r\nservice under Gen. George Washington, but the chiefs probably received\r\nmedals or certificates in his name, and thus considered themselves\r\nfighting under his care. The Potawatomi returned to the British\r\nallegiance later, and opposed the Americans during all of the Indian\r\nwars. If our surmise of what Quitos means about Old Thunder is\r\ncorrect, it is a remarkable instance of the persistence of tradition\r\nconcerning an American alliance, and a corroboration of Col. George\r\nRogers Clark’s testimony about the attitude of the Milwaukee\r\nPotawatomi. Clark calls the two chiefs Saguina or “Mr. Black Bird and\r\nNakiowin, two chiefs of the Bands of the sotairs [Chippewa] and\r\nOutaway Nation bordering on Lake Michigan and the River St. Joseph.”\r\nDe Peyster, the British commandant at Mackinac, speaks in his poem or\r\nrhymed chronicle of 1779 of “Those runagates at Milwakie” and calls\r\nthem in a footnote “A horrid set of refractory Indians.” Thus in the\r\nRevolution, while most of the Wisconsin Indians were strong British\r\nsupporters, the mixed band of Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi west of\r\nLake Michigan were American sympathizers.\r\n\r\nWith regard to your second question: There is no record in the _Jesuit\r\nRelations_ of any visit of Allouez and Dablon to Milwaukee in 1670.\r\nSuch a statement was made before Dr. Thwaites’s edition of the _Jesuit\r\nRelations_ appeared. Upon the publication in English of the exact text\r\nof the _Relations_ it was seen that Allouez visited the Kickapoo in\r\n1670 (not accompanied by Dablon) at their village four leagues (about\r\nfifteen miles) from the Mascouten village which was near the site of\r\nthe modern Berlin, on the upper Fox River. Thus it was impossible for\r\nthe Kickapoo village to have been at Milwaukee. It is quite probable\r\nthat Perrot and other traders may have been at Milwaukee and along the\r\nshore of Lake Michigan before Jolliet and Marquette, but there is no\r\nrecorded voyage before theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE INDIAN TRIBES OF IOWA\r\n\r\n     Please send me the name and history of any or all the Indian\r\n     tribes that at first occupied the state of Iowa. Also give\r\n     me the name and history of any Indian tribe that once lived\r\n     for a time, either long or short, in Iowa.\r\n\r\n                                         DANIEL MCKENNA,\r\n                                      _Charles City, Iowa_.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes who are known to have dwelt in Iowa since historic\r\ntimes are the following:\r\n\r\nThe Illinois were found there by Marquette and Jolliet in 1673, but\r\nreturned to the east side of the Mississippi in a few years.\r\n\r\nThe Iowa (name spelled in a great variety of ways, as Aiouais, Aoyest,\r\nAyoes, Ayouez) were a Siouan or a Dakotan tribe found on the Des\r\nMoines River about the close of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux, whose eastern and southern branches extended into northern\r\nIowa, where they were known to the whites in the late seventeenth\r\ncentury. The Kickapoo and Mascouten, allied tribes, driven from\r\nWisconsin into Iowa about 1728. The Kickapoo soon removed; a few of\r\nthe Mascouten lingered and gave their name to Muscatine.\r\n\r\nThe Sauk and Foxes, who after their defeat in Wisconsin in 1733 became\r\nallied tribes, and made their home thereafter chiefly in Iowa. Their\r\nvillages in 1805 were along the Mississippi from Des Moines Rapids to\r\nTurkey River. By a treaty of 1842 they were to remove from Iowa; many\r\ncame back and wandered on the Iowa and Des Moines rivers until they\r\npurchased lands in Tama County where they still dwell, now called the\r\nMusquakie or Meskwaki Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Winnebago who removed from Wisconsin after the treaty of 1837 to\r\nnortheastern Iowa where they had a school and agency on Yellow River.\r\nIn 1848 they were removed to Minnesota. The Omaha or Maha Indians\r\nlived in northwestern Iowa when Lewis and Clark ascended the Missouri\r\nin 1804. In 1830 they ceded their lands to the United States which in\r\n1833 ceded a portion to the allied Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi\r\ntribes. Most of those who lived on this reservation from about 1835 to\r\n1846 were Potawatomi.\r\n\r\nFor further history of these tribes apply to the Iowa Department of\r\nHistory at Des Moines, Edgar R. Harlan, curator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD COPPERHEADS AND NEW\r\n\r\nThe editorial in the September number of the _Wisconsin Magazine of\r\nHistory_ entitled “Consolation for the Present Crisis,” has prompted\r\nme to enlarge upon one of its themes. Those of our citizens who feel\r\ndisturbed by the presence among us of an anti-war element may find\r\nencouragement in a further recital of the doings of the anti-war\r\nadvocates in Wisconsin half a century ago.\r\n\r\nShortly after the firing on Fort Sumter, when the North was roused to\r\nthe utmost pitch of excitement, the democratic members of the\r\nlegislature together with certain citizens of Madison, arranged for a\r\npeace mass meeting in the assembly chamber for the purpose of devising\r\nsome compromise which should suffice to avert the impending war. At\r\nthe appointed time the chamber was thronged with citizens, and a\r\nnumber of speeches were made by legislators and townsmen conveying\r\nvarious proposals of compromise which should be tendered the southern\r\npeople. These addresses were vigorously applauded by a large\r\nproportion of the audience. Before the close of the meeting, however,\r\nthere were calls for Senator Dean, a republican whose loyalty to the\r\ngovernment was unquestioned. Greeted with tumultuous applause, he\r\nproceeded, after a few stirring sentences about the duties of\r\ncitizenship, to say: “Compromise? Yes, we will compromise with them!\r\nWe will send a million free men down through the southern states and\r\ndrive the whole confederate army into the Gulf of Mexico!” The\r\napplause which greeted this sentiment shook the building, and lasted\r\nten minutes or more. The meeting immediately adjourned, leaving the\r\npeace advocates without a program.\r\n\r\nAs the war progressed, and the future seemed dark indeed, another\r\npeace meeting was called at Madison, to be held in Capital Park. Noted\r\nspeakers were engaged, and it was expected that a great demonstration\r\nin favor of ending the war would be staged. By this time Camp Randall\r\nhad come into being as the principal military encampment for\r\nWisconsin’s soldiers. Naturally the men did not look with enthusiasm\r\nupon the impending peace meeting. On the appointed day two or three\r\nhundred soldiers, having secured leave of absence from camp, dragged a\r\nsix-pound cannon to capitol square; loading it with canister, they\r\nplanted it in front of the speaker’s stand, with the quiet assurance\r\nto those in charge of the meeting that as soon as a treasonable word\r\nshould be uttered the orator and all on the platform would be blown to\r\nhell. Under these circumstances the meeting proved very tame, the\r\nspeeches being confined to deprecating the necessity for the war and\r\nhoping it would soon be over.\r\n\r\nThe Copperheads, as they had come to be called, did not omit any\r\nopportunity to flaunt their sentiments before the supporters of the\r\ngovernment. In Madison alone probably hundreds of old-fashioned copper\r\ncents (a coin nearly an inch and a quarter in diameter) were filed\r\ndown so as to leave only the Indian head in profile. To this a pin was\r\naffixed for attachment to the coat lapel, and the coins were worn to\r\nafford evidence that the wearer was a Copperhead in sentiment. Loyal\r\ncitizens responded to this challenge by filing the eagle out of the\r\nsilver quarter and wearing it as a badge. One prominent citizen, who\r\nwore the copperhead for over a year, lived to say that it was the one\r\naction of his life of which he was heartily ashamed.\r\n\r\nThere is today no such villification and abuse of President Wilson as\r\nwas heaped upon Lincoln during the Civil War. After every Union defeat\r\nthe Copperheads would say: “What did we tell you? You can never whip\r\nthe South!” Some of the newspapers were so disloyal in sentiment that\r\nthey were suppressed by military authority. In fact, the situation was\r\nvery grave. In comparison with it the current pacifist machinations\r\nappear tame and insignificant. The great mass of the people, however,\r\nwere determined to stand by the government till victory should be\r\nachieved. They persevered in this determination and the Union was\r\npreserved. So will it be today, whether the end comes in one year or\r\nfive, whether the cost be five billions of dollars or fifty. There\r\nmust be no compromise. Let the fight be to the finish.\r\n\r\n                          Sincerely yours,\r\n                                               E. C. MASON.\r\nMadison, October 1, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRESBYTERIAN OBJECTS\r\n\r\nI have been reading the report of the sixty-fourth annual meeting of\r\nthe State Historical Society of Wisconsin which I received yesterday.\r\nI was interested in the article by the pioneer missionary, especially\r\nas much of his work was done in a part of Wisconsin where I labored\r\nyears ago. On page 184, in a note about Rev. Isaac Baird, it is said\r\nthat he was appointed to Odanah, which is correct. Such positions must\r\nbe filled by appointment. I may say that, unless my memory deceives\r\nme, the work at Odanah was of more consequence than Father Verwyst’s\r\nremarks would indicate. But it is said that Mr. Baird was removed to\r\nCrystal Falls, Michigan. I think it should rather be that Mr. Baird\r\naccepted a call to the pastorate of the church at Crystal Falls or to\r\nbe its stated supply. If the writer of the word had written “Mr. Baird\r\nremoved,” there would be no objection to the statement from a\r\nPresbyterian standpoint. But “was removed,” that is another matter.\r\n\r\nIn a speech delivered in the British House of Commons, July 9, 1845,\r\nMacaulay said, “All staunch Presbyterians think that the flock is\r\nentitled, _jure divino_, to a voice in the appointment of a pastor,\r\nand that to force a pastor on a parish to which he is unacceptable is\r\na sin forbidden by the Word of God as idolatry or perjury. I am quite\r\nsure that I do not exaggerate when I say that the highest of our high\r\nchurchmen at Oxford cannot attach more importance to episcopal\r\ngovernment and episcopal ordination than many thousands of Scotchmen,\r\nshrewd men, respectable men, who fear God and honor the Queen, attach\r\nto this right of the people.” And to go to the fountain head, in “The\r\nBuke of Discipline” by John Knox, are these words. “It apperteneth to\r\nthe Pepill and to every severall Congregation, to Elect thair\r\nMinister.” I quote _verbatim et literatim_. There is much more to the\r\nsame effect. Excuse me for this screed, but I spent a good many years\r\nin Wisconsin as a Presbyterian minister and was used to having this\r\nquestion “speired at me” as the Scotch would say, when I returned from\r\na meeting of presbytery, “Have you been sent back for another year?”\r\nWhen I explained to those people the Presbyterian way of doing, no one\r\nbut said, “I believe that is the best way.” Yet many Presbyterians in\r\nWisconsin wish to deny to the people that right. The note I refer to\r\nwas written by a man who did not know the Presbyterian way of doing or\r\nelse was one of the Presbyterians I referred to just above.[96] But\r\nthose Presbyterians did not know the history of their own church. A\r\ngreat fight for democracy is on and we must fight for democracy in the\r\nchurch as well as in the state if we are to make the democracy of the\r\nstate a success. See Fiske’s _Beginnings of New England_. Hence I do\r\nnot wish the Wisconsin Historical Society to help even by a note the\r\nautocratic tendencies of some Wisconsin Presbyterians. Let us advance\r\nin democracy by going back to the time when people chose their\r\nbishop--you know the story of the election of Ambrose of Milan.\r\n\r\n          I remain\r\n                  Yours faithfully and gratefully,\r\n                                             ANGUS SILLARS.\r\nFairmount, Ill., July 24, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [96] The editor of the Society, rather than Father Verwyst,\r\n     author of the article is responsible for the footnote\r\n     statement which Mr. Sillars calls in question. It is freely\r\n     admitted that he “did not know the Presbyterian way of\r\n     doing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURVEY OF HISTORICAL ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIETY AND THE STATE\r\n\r\nSeven new members have joined the State Historical Society during the\r\nquarter ending September 30; Charles D. Rosa, of Beloit; Edward P.\r\nFarley, of Chicago; Earl Murray, of Green Bay; William T. Evjue, of\r\nMadison; Frank M. Crowley, of Madison; Charles H. Crownhart, of\r\nMadison; and Dr. L.A. Quaife, of Rosalia, Washington. In the same\r\nperiod the Society lost through death two of its valued members, Otto\r\nB. Joerns, of Stevens Point, and Henry E. Legler, of Chicago.\r\n\r\nIn the death of Henry E. Legler on September 13 this Society sustained\r\nthe loss of a valued friend and member. Many and divers as were the\r\npublic positions he occupied--newspaper editor, legislator, secretary\r\nof the Milwaukee School Board, secretary of the Wisconsin Free Library\r\nCommission, librarian of the Chicago Public Library--it is not to the\r\nman as a public official that our thoughts involuntarily turn, but to\r\nthe man as a friend. With unusual business capability, which involved\r\nsecuring the utmost of service and loyalty from his employees, Mr.\r\nLegler was possessed of personal characteristics that endeared him as\r\nwell to the office messenger as to the members of the governing boards\r\nunder whom he worked. His associations with this Society and the\r\nmembers of the library staff were long and close, and it seems fitting\r\nthat we should express both sorrow for his loss, and gratification\r\nthat it had been our privilege to have known him intimately.\r\n\r\nMiss Mabel Swerig, for two years a faithful and efficient worker in\r\nthe reference division of the Historical Library, severed her\r\nconnection with the Society in September in order to enter upon a\r\ncourse of library training at Pratt Institute, Brooklyn. Miss Mary\r\nFarley, for three years a member of the library staff, on October 1,\r\nassumed direction of the library maintained by Marshall Field and\r\nCompany for its employees. The new position will afford Miss Farley an\r\nexcellent opportunity for development in the line of her chosen\r\nprofession. At the beginning of September Theron Brown, for the past\r\ntwo years assistant in the public documents division of the Library,\r\nenlisted for technical service in the United States Navy.\r\n\r\nCarl Russell Fish and Frederic Logan Paxson, curators of the Society\r\nand professors of American history in the University of Wisconsin,\r\nspent the summer in Washington engaged in service for the government.\r\nProfessor Fish’s time was given to the National Board for Historical\r\nService, of which he is a member. Professor Paxson gave his services\r\nto the committee on public information.\r\n\r\nProf. Winfred T. Root, member of the State Historical Society and of\r\nthe faculty of the State University, conducted history courses at the\r\nsummer session of the University of Chicago.\r\n\r\nRev. Eugene Updike recently terminated a twenty-seven year pastorate\r\nof the First Congregational Church of Madison. In the last fifty-two\r\nyears this church has had but two pastors, Mr. Updike’s predecessor\r\nhaving served a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nCapt. Arthur L. Conger, who delivered the annual address at the\r\nmeeting of the State Historical Society in 1916, is now serving on\r\nGeneral Pershing’s staff in France. Mrs. Conger has recently gone to\r\nFrance to be near her husband.\r\n\r\nAt the time of going to press, plans are practically complete for the\r\nannual meeting of the State Historical Society to take place October\r\n25. Two events new to the annual program are a luncheon to be tendered\r\nby the Society to its members and invited friends and a conference of\r\nlocal historical societies. Because of Prof. Frederic L. Paxson’s work\r\nfor the government, he was unable to prepare the annual address\r\nannounced in the September number of the _Magazine_. In his stead\r\nProf. Carl R. Fish will speak on “The Frontier a World Problem.” A\r\nfull report of the meeting will appear in a later number of the\r\n_Magazine_.\r\n\r\nThe use of pageantry in depicting the historical development of a\r\ncommunity is rapidly gaining headway in Wisconsin. Among those that\r\nattracted state-wide attention was the one given at Portage during the\r\nweek of the Columbia County Fair, August 22-25, 1917. “America and the\r\nNations” was the title of the pageant, and it was given in three\r\nepisodes. In the first there was a symbolical scene representing the\r\nspirit of the Fox and the Wisconsin rivers. Then followed the Jesuit\r\nfathers, French traders, trappers, and pioneers. In the second episode\r\nthe coming of miners, lumbermen, fishermen, and farmers was witnessed.\r\nThe closing scene was a grand review of all the leading nations of the\r\nworld, symbolizing an international unity. Over 700 people took part\r\nin the pageant.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Chippewa County staged an interesting pageant at\r\nHolcombe during the week of their Community Fair, September 13 and 14.\r\nThe pageant, given under the direction of H. A. Edminster, portrayed\r\nthe coming of the fur traders in the Chippewa Valley, a bit of Indian\r\nlife, the coming of the priests, lumbermen, and the first permanent\r\nsettlers. The closing scene depicted the modern economic and\r\nindustrial development of that region. One very interesting part of\r\nthe performance was the appearance of an ox team hitched to an old\r\n“jumper,” driven by Mr. and Mrs. Edminister, representing their coming\r\ninto that region.\r\n\r\nAmong those working for the cause of history in Wisconsin, none are\r\ndoing more effective or practical work than some of the history\r\ncommittees of the county councils of defense. Among those that are\r\nrendering a real service is the committee of Eau Claire County, headed\r\nby William W. Bartlett. Their object is to gather, preserve, index,\r\nand make available for public use the proceedings of every event that\r\ntakes place in Eau Claire County pertaining to the war. A complete\r\nfile of newspaper clippings that deal with the war will be preserved.\r\nAlso an effort is being made to secure a photograph and brief sketch\r\nof every young man entering the service from Eau Claire County. Such\r\npractical work as this commends itself to every patriotic citizen in\r\nWisconsin, and the committees in other counties might do well to\r\nfollow Eau Claire’s lead.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles E. Brown, chief of the Wisconsin Historical Museum,\r\nentertained in September a group of friends who are interested in the\r\nstudy of local Indian history at his attractive home in Nakoma, a\r\nsuburb of Madison. A picnic supper was served, after which Mr. Brown\r\ngave an instructive talk upon Nakoma and its environment. Brief talks\r\nrelating chiefly to Indian history were made by others present.\r\n\r\nThe surviving members of the Fifteenth Wisconsin Infantry held a joint\r\nmeeting with the Scandinavian Veterans’ Association at Madison in\r\nSeptember and plans were inaugurated for erecting a monument to the\r\nmemory of Colonel Heg. Wisconsin had the distinction during the war of\r\nsending a regiment to the front composed almost exclusively of\r\nScandinavians. Col. Hans Heg, their famous commander, was born in\r\nNorway, and came to America when eleven years old. At the opening of\r\nthe Civil War he was holding the position of state prison\r\ncommissioner, which he resigned in order to raise a regiment of\r\ntroops. The Fifteenth Wisconsin brought credit to itself and to its\r\nstate, and the name of Colonel Heg deserves a permanent place among\r\nthe Wisconsin heroes of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the Wisconsin Federation of Women’s Clubs, held in\r\nMadison during October, the history section met in the museum of the\r\nState Historical Society. The visitors were taken for an automobile\r\nride and sightseeing trip about the city.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of the Sauk County Historical Society was held at\r\nBaraboo, October 5, 1917. All the officers of the Society were\r\nreëlected for the ensuing year. The report of the treasurer revealed\r\nan especially gratifying condition, a considerable sum of money in the\r\ntreasury and practically all membership dues paid in. A bequest of\r\n$200 from the estate of the late W. W. Warner of Madison, was received\r\nduring the year. The Society voted to send two delegates to the annual\r\nmeeting of the State Historical Society at Madison, October 25. The\r\naddress of the evening was given by Mr. M. M. Quaife, Superintendent\r\nof the State Historical Society, on the subject, “The Angel of\r\nWisconsin.”\r\n\r\nThe Old Rivermen’s Association of Minneapolis and St. Paul held their\r\nmeeting in the latter city on September 4, 1917, and the chief address\r\nof the meeting was given by George B. Merrick, of Madison. No group of\r\nmen in the upper Mississippi Valley has played a more romantic part in\r\nthe opening up of this region than the old steamboat men. Their\r\nmembership now numbers about 150, and the experiences which they\r\nrelate form an interesting chapter in early Wisconsin history.\r\n\r\nWisconsin’s Indian drama entitled “Glory of the Morning,” written by\r\nProf. W. E. Leonard, is being produced by Mrs. Emma Garrett Boyd of\r\nthe Casino Studio, New York. The proceeds are being devoted to the war\r\nfund. This drama was first produced in Madison in 1912 by the\r\nWisconsin Dramatic Society under the direction of Prof. T. H.\r\nDickinson. As a summer festival play it has become one of the most\r\npopular in the country.\r\n\r\nAn interesting old account book kept by Jean Brunet of Brunet Falls\r\n(now Cornell), Wisconsin, was recently given to the Society by Mrs.\r\nGustave Robart of Holcombe. The old Brunet tavern was the most widely\r\nknown of any in the Chippewa Valley, and every traveler who went up\r\nand down the valley stopped with Jean Brunet. During its palmy days as\r\nmany as 150 men were fed there at one time. The entries in the book\r\ncover the period from 1862 to 1876. Mrs. Robart, its donor, is a child\r\nof the first white settler in that part of the valley.\r\n\r\nRecent accessions to the Society’s historical museum include fine\r\nexamples of early English chinaware, an early American clock, lamp,\r\nchildren’s clothing, laces and embroideries, a steelyard, kitchen fire\r\nshovel, boat-builders’ rule, a railroad stock certificate, and other\r\narticles of interest. The most valuable single specimen is a large\r\nsilver trophy cup given by the _Army and Navy News_ and won by the\r\nFirst Wisconsin Infantry in the Second Brigade football contest among\r\nthe troops stationed on the Mexican border in 1916.\r\n\r\nAn interesting collection of war relics has been placed on exhibit in\r\none of the rooms of the museum just off the auditorium. The exhibit\r\nrepresents the current history of the present war, as illustrated by\r\nrelics, war implements, and posters. The contents of the exhibit are\r\nchanged every few days.\r\n\r\nA valuable collection of papers was recently presented to the Society\r\nby Dr. Herbert B. Tanner. The collection contains many of the letters\r\nof John Lawe, the well-known merchant and fur trader of Green Bay, and\r\nsome letters of George Boyd, an early Wisconsin Indian agent. Lawe\r\nthrough an inheritance left him by his uncle, Jacob Franks of\r\nMontreal, became a very wealthy trader, and following the War of 1812\r\nsettled in Green Bay. Here he acted as agent for the American Fur\r\nCompany and his operations extended from Milwaukee as far west and\r\nnorth as the upper Mississippi. As adviser and counselor for the\r\nIndians and fur traders he became the leading citizen in what is now\r\nWisconsin. Dr. Tanner’s donation contains fifty-three letters written\r\nby Lawe himself, ranging in time from 1824 until his death in 1846.\r\nTheir chief interest lies in the additional light that they throw upon\r\nthe early fur-trading interests of Wisconsin and the Northwest. The\r\ncollection contains eighteen letters written by Jacob Franks covering\r\nthe period from 1818 to 1830. Those written during the latter years\r\nexpress a feeling of regret over the gradual disappearance of the fur\r\ntrade, and the coming in of new settlers. There are several letters of\r\na personal nature that add interest to the collection. The Society is\r\nindebted to Doctor Tanner for this contribution of fur-trading\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME WISCONSIN PUBLIC DOCUMENTS, JANUARY-JULY, 1917\r\n\r\nThe sixty-fourth annual session of the Wisconsin Teachers’ Association\r\nwas held at Milwaukee, November 2 to 4, 1916. The chief value of its\r\npublished _Proceedings_ is in the fifty-nine papers and abstracts\r\nwhich it contains. Four of the principal addresses form a symposium on\r\nthe subject of progress during the last decade in rural schools,\r\nsecondary schools, normal schools, and the University of Wisconsin,\r\nthe fourth topic being discussed by Dr. Charles R. Van Hise in his\r\npresidential address. Three important papers deal with recent\r\nachievements in elementary, rural, and secondary education. Notable\r\naddresses by persons from outside the state are those of William Wirt,\r\nJohn Finley, L. D. Coffman, and Dr. Maria Montessori. In addition to\r\nthe papers, the volume contains minutes of business sessions,\r\ncommittee reports, the constitution and by-laws of the organization,\r\nand a list of members.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-second report of the commissioner of banking deals with the\r\nyear closing on November 17, 1916. During this period state banks and\r\ntrust companies gained $774,100 in capital invested, representing in\r\nall an investment of $23,672,350. The total resources of\r\n$298,617,175.61 show a gain for the year of $44,675,247.15. The\r\nincrease in deposits amounted to $43,424,626.33. Attention is called\r\nto the increase from 21% to 22.7% in the average reserve held by state\r\nbanks. The conclusion of the commissioner, based upon an analysis of\r\nthe statistics of which the report largely consists, is that “the\r\nfinancial outlook for Wisconsin is most encouraging.” In a section on\r\nlegislation the passage of a law to create a uniform system of school\r\nsavings banks, under state supervision and subject to state control,\r\nis recommended. Most of the report is given over to statements of\r\nstate banks, mutual savings banks, trust companies, land mortgage\r\nassociations, and national banks.\r\n\r\nThe Department of English of the University of Wisconsin has issued a\r\nsmall pamphlet with the title _A List of Books on the War_. Out of the\r\ngreat mass of books on the subject a rigorous selection of some 270\r\ntitles has been made. These aim to include the most important works\r\npublished prior to June 1, 1917. Short pamphlets and tracts have been\r\nexcluded, and the titles are chiefly English and French. They are\r\ngrouped into six divisions: “Background and Origins,” “Course and\r\nConduct,” “Personal Narratives,” “Thought concerning the War,” “Peace\r\nand Readjustment,” “Miscellaneous.” The selections are discriminating,\r\nand the bulletin should prove of great value to students of the war.\r\n\r\nAn admirable innovation has been made in issuing the Governor’s\r\nMemorial Day proclamation as a small pamphlet, very neatly put up,\r\nrather than as a broadside of large, awkward size, and difficult to\r\npreserve in a series.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the dairy industry in Wisconsin is clearly brought\r\nout in a report of the dairy and food commissioner on _Butter\r\nFactories and Cheese Factories Operated in 1916; Dairy Statistics for\r\n1915_. The gross profits in all branches of the industry for 1915 are\r\nestimated at more than $110,000,000. Approximately 235,000,000 pounds\r\nof cheese were produced. More than 124,000,000 pounds of butter were\r\nmade in the state, about 20,000,000 pounds in excess of the production\r\nof 1909. The report contains an interesting statistical comparison of\r\ncheese and butter production for the years 1909 and 1915. Lists of\r\noperators of butter and cheese factories, and of cheese factories\r\noperated in 1916 by counties, are included. There is also a list of\r\ncondenseries in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n_Agriculture in the High School, A Manual for the High Schools of\r\nWisconsin_ has been brought out by the Department of Public\r\nInstruction. The authors are Henry N. Goddard and John A. James.\r\nIssued as a guide for high schools giving agricultural work,\r\nparticularly for those maintaining four-year departments, the manual\r\nillustrates admirably the new movement in secondary education. A\r\nhistorical sketch contains an account of the various laws which have\r\nshaped the agricultural movement in Wisconsin. The proper\r\ninterpretation and method of applying these laws is made clear. The\r\npractical problems of the needs in the organization and management of\r\nhigh school agricultural departments are considered in detail, and a\r\ngreat amount of material helpful to the administration of such a\r\ndepartment--particularly as to the scope and character of the work--is\r\nincluded. The manual has been prepared with great care, and appears to\r\nbe a model of its kind.\r\n\r\nThe last report of the attorney-general continues the opinions,\r\nJanuary 1, 1916, to December 31, 1916, and the eighth biennial report,\r\nJuly 1, 1914 to June 30, 1916. The first 65 pages contain a summary of\r\nthe work of the attorney-general. An examination of these pages shows\r\nthat during the period indicated 68 civil, 59 industrial commission, 2\r\nbankruptcy, and 8 forfeiture cases were disposed of. Thirty-six\r\ncriminal cases were disposed of, 23 in lower courts, 12 in the Supreme\r\nCourt, and 1 in the United States Supreme Court. The official opinions\r\nof the attorney-general, filling 917 pages, embrace in their scope a\r\ngreat amount of state activity. In the printing of these opinions\r\nthere is no classification or grouping of the material, such as in the\r\nreports of the attorney-general of Indiana, for example. A strictly\r\nchronological order is followed.\r\n\r\nThe report of the dairy and food commissioner for the year ending June\r\n30, 1916, illustrates the vital need of protecting the public against\r\nthe sale of adulterated and misbranded foods. It contains the reports\r\nof the state chemist, dealing with the inspection of beverages, canned\r\nvegetables, dairy products, dried fruit, and drugs; of the assistant\r\ndairy and food commissioner, and of the inspector of weights and\r\nmeasures. Special attention is called to the new dairy and food laws,\r\nand the new era in the dairy industry of Wisconsin which these laws\r\nintroduce. As a result of unsanitary conditions in cheese factories\r\nand meat markets, and misrepresentations of foods, 79 convictions were\r\nsecured. Druggists to the number of 226 were selling spirits of\r\ncamphor not standard. Between April 17 and June 30, 2,221 factories\r\nwere inspected. It was found that 35% of the butter factory operators\r\nand 24% of the cheese factory operators were complying with the\r\nlicense law and the new regulations. Much has been done in the\r\neconomic interests of the public by the inspector of weights and\r\nmeasures, for the number of inaccurate computing scales decreased from\r\n17% in 1914 to 8% in 1916.\r\n\r\n_The Country Church an Economic and Social Force_ is an interesting\r\nbulletin edited by the Agricultural Experiment Station of the\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin. It points out that the thriving church in a\r\nrural community tends to unify agriculture, which in turn serves to\r\nnurture the church. The country or hamlet church thrives best where\r\npopulation is constant, and successful farming is advanced through the\r\ninfluence of the church upon daily habits. It is suggested that\r\nprinciples for the re-parishing of rural districts might be\r\nestablished through a joint commission of the national religious\r\nbodies, with a view toward creating stronger churches for the farmers.\r\nSeveral descriptions are given of Wisconsin country churches in which\r\nthe religious leaders are fostering a progressive agriculture through\r\ncoöperative social development. The remarkable story of a great\r\ncountry pastor, John Frederick Oberlin, who for sixty years labored\r\nfor the social, industrial, and religious uplift of a poverty-stricken\r\ncommunity, is given in illustration of the theories advanced in the\r\nbulletin.\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth biennial report of the Wisconsin state prison is\r\nlargely statistical. The average number of convicts for the year\r\nending June 30, 1915, was 807; for the year ending June 30, 1916, it\r\nwas 906. During the latter period 140 to 180 convicts were employed\r\nand housed outside of the walls of the institution. Under the\r\nchaplain’s direction, school was held from one to two o’clock, three\r\ndays a week, during six months of the year. There were fourteen\r\nclasses and an average attendance of 110 men. Instruction was given\r\nthe illiterate in four grades in reading, arithmetic, writing, and\r\nspelling. Earnings of inmates for the year were $35,696.50. New\r\nprisoners admitted numbered 511; of these 483 were male; 23 were under\r\ntwenty years of age, and 117 over fifty years; 495 were white, 12\r\nblack, 3 Indian, and 1 mulatto; 230 were Catholic, 148 Protestants,\r\n108 Lutherans, 3 Hebrews, 1 Greek Orthodox, 1 Seventh Day Adventist;\r\n17 had no religion; 27 were illiterate, 41 had high school education,\r\nand 7 were college men; 174 were native to Wisconsin, 28 to Illinois,\r\n29 to Michigan, 19 to Minnesota, 20 to New York, and 11 to\r\nPennsylvania; 26 were born in Austro-Hungary, 20 in Finland, 34 in\r\nGermany, 10 in Norway, and 27 in Russia. The others came from various\r\nstates and countries throughout the world. Statistics are given\r\nconcerning occupations, residence by counties, crimes, terms of\r\nsentences, discharges, pardons, population since the organization of\r\nthe prison in 1852, the binder twine plant, farm and gardening\r\noperations, and many other matters.\r\n\r\nThe merit system for the public service of Wisconsin was established\r\nin 1905, and the sixth biennial report of the Civil Service Commission\r\nhas now been issued, covering the work done from July, 1914, to July,\r\n1916. The classified service of the state comprises the exempt,\r\ncompetitive, noncompetitive, legislative employee, and labor classes.\r\nIn these classes there are about 3,200 employees. From July 1, 1914 to\r\nJuly 1, 1916, 4,995 persons took competitive examinations. Of these,\r\n2,903 passed, 2,079 failed; 376 permanent and 147 temporary\r\nappointments were made. That is, 58% passed, and 10½% were appointed\r\nto positions. The number of applicants for positions at state\r\ninstitutions has decreased, for various reasons. The report contains a\r\nmap showing the number and distribution of employees in the state\r\nclassified service. It also presents the results of certain studies\r\naiming to increase the efficiency of the service. Half of the report\r\nconsists of financial tables and rules.\r\n\r\nThe chief functions of the state fire marshal, as indicated in his\r\nninth annual report, are two: combatting incendiarism, and doing fire\r\nprevention work. Coöperating with the local departments, the fire\r\nmarshal has investigated 389 fires during the period covered by the\r\nreport, from July 1, 1915 to December 31, 1916. Forty-six arrests were\r\nmade, 12 persons were convicted and sentenced, 5 pleaded guilty and\r\nwere sentenced, 6 were paroled, and 5 were sent to the hospital for\r\nthe insane. In the year ending December 31, 1915, 3,066 fires in the\r\nstate damaged buildings and contents to the extent of $5,932,980.\r\nThese figures show the importance of the educational campaign for fire\r\nprevention conducted by the fire marshal. Thirteen newspaper articles\r\nwere issued. These are printed in full in the report. Some of the\r\ntitles are: _Some Fires and Their Lessons_, _Safe Homes_, _Gasoline_,\r\n_Kerosene_, _Spring Clean Up_, _Safe Schoolhouses_, and _Holiday\r\nFires_. The report contains tables dealing with values, losses,\r\nclassification of property, fire causes, number of fires according to\r\nclassification of risk and cause, and other matters.\r\n\r\nThe biennial report of the adjutant-general deals with the two fiscal\r\nyears ending June 30, 1916. It is a survey of the military activities\r\nof the state of Wisconsin during a period of trial and service. From\r\nJuly 1, 1914 to June 30, 1916, the Wisconsin National Guard increased\r\nfrom 201 officers and 2,990 enlisted men to a total of 208 officers\r\nand 4,224 enlisted men. Of these the report states that “4,168\r\nofficers and men are temporarily in the service of the United States\r\nin response to the call of the President issued June 18, 1916.” Since\r\nthe date of this report, the war has placed a new responsibility upon\r\nthe guard. The adjutant-general’s report gives information in regard\r\nto organization and strength, legislation, equipment, instruction,\r\nsmall arms firing, naval militia, medical department, expenses,\r\nmilitary reservation, and pensions. The National Defense Act oath,\r\nmaking obligatory a three-year term of reserve service by national\r\nguard organizations, was taken by officers and enlisted men of the\r\nguard “with fine zeal and loyalty to their country, their state, and\r\ntheir organization.”\r\n\r\nThe first biennial report of the State Conservation Commission is one\r\nof unusual interest. Through a law of 1915 this commission (consisting\r\nof three commissioners and a secretary) succeeded to the powers and\r\nduties of the Forestry Board, State Park Board, Conservation\r\nCommission, Commissioners of Fisheries, and the State Fish and Game\r\nWarden Department. The purpose was to consolidate “all the closely\r\nrelated duties and problems of administration over forest and stream,\r\nfish and game, and to give powerful impetus to the conservation of the\r\nnatural resources of the Badger State.” The result has been a notable\r\nincrease in efficiency and economy. The change, it may be noted,\r\ndispensed with the services of twenty-two members of boards and\r\ncommissions. A strict civil service régime has been inaugurated. The\r\nreport contains a considerable number of papers and division reports\r\ndealing with the conditions, problems, constructive plans and\r\nachievements which are shaping the conservation movement in the state.\r\nA large number of admirably chosen illustrations show the richness,\r\nvariety, and beauty of the resources of nature in Wisconsin. These\r\npictures enhance the value of a report which contains information of\r\npeculiar interest and significance to the people of the state.\r\n\r\nThe biennial report of the secretary of state is largely a collection\r\nof financial statistics covering the fiscal years ending June 30, 1915\r\nand June 30, 1916. The condition of all state funds, receipts and\r\ndisbursements, the net disbursements of the state, the valuation of\r\ntaxable property in the counties, and the apportionment of tax and\r\nspecial charges for 1914 and 1915, collected in 1915, are shown in\r\ndetailed statements, and various tabular statements.\r\n\r\nPart four of the ninth annual report of the Railroad Commission is an\r\nelaborate collection of financial and operating statistics of railroad\r\ncompanies for the period from June 30, 1914 to June 30, 1915. The\r\nreport is divided into three parts: steam railroads, electric\r\nrailways, and express companies. There are 234 closely printed pages\r\nof statistical tables and figures, which lay bare with utmost\r\nexactness and detail all phases of the finances and operations of the\r\nthree classes of public carriers mentioned. The statistics are not\r\nconfined merely to Wisconsin; for example, the tables exhibiting the\r\nincome account of steam railroads for the year ending December 31,\r\n1914, show first the accounts of interstate roads in Wisconsin, and\r\nthereafter the records of the entire systems of interstate roads which\r\noperate in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThe Railroad Commission of Wisconsin has published a digest covering\r\nthe decisions contained in volumes I to XV of the official reports of\r\nthe commission. The digest therefore covers all the decisions from\r\nJuly 20, 1905 to February 4, 1915. The compilation has been made by\r\nHarold L. Geisse. Its purpose is “to state briefly and yet clearly the\r\nprinciples and facts set forth in the decisions of the Commission….”\r\nThe subject titles are alphabetically arranged, and carefully\r\nsupplemented by cross-references. Precise references to sources are\r\ngiven for each decision. The value of such a compilation for lawyers\r\nis obvious. It should be noted that the separate volumes of the\r\nreports are each provided with an “index-digest.” For example, in\r\nvolume XVI, recently published, this index covers pages 869 to 936.\r\nVolume XVI contains the opinions and decisions of the Railroad\r\nCommission from February 10, 1915 to November 15, 1915. Reports are\r\ngiven on hundreds of important cases dealing with railway, telegraph,\r\ntelephone, express, and public utility problems.\r\n\r\nThough the task of administering the income tax law is not at all\r\ntimes pleasant or easy, yet, in the opinion of the Wisconsin Tax\r\nCommission, “five years of experience have proved the law workable;\r\ntaxpayers generally comply with its mandates without objection; and\r\nthe resulting revenue has exceeded all expectations.” A chapter\r\ndealing especially with problems in the administration of the income\r\ntax law, and a series of tables showing the results of the income\r\nassessments of 1913, 1914, 1915, and 1916, form an interesting part of\r\nthe eighth biennial report of the Wisconsin Tax Commission. This\r\nreport is a detailed statement of the work of the commission for the\r\nyears ending June 30, 1915 and June 30, 1916. In addition to the\r\nsection on the income tax, the chief features of the report are its\r\nchapters on “Duties of Tax Commission,” “General Revision of Tax Laws\r\nRecommended,” “Assessment and Taxation of Public Service Companies,”\r\n“Inheritance Tax,” “Report of Engineers,” “Municipal Statistics,” and\r\n“Statistics of Assessments and Taxes.” A thoughtful address by Thomas\r\nE. Lyons on the subject “Our Increasing Public Expenditures” is\r\nincluded. Mr. Lyons finds the remedy for the situation in a closer\r\nlimitation of the taxing and borrowing powers.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin state budget for 1917 was compiled for the use of the\r\nlegislature of 1917 by the State Board of Public Affairs. In\r\nscientific completeness it represents a considerable advance upon\r\nformer publications of the kind. To aid the legislature in\r\n“determining policies, and in working out a definite fiscal program\r\nand in the drafting of appropriate measures,” complete information is\r\nfurnished along six lines. These are as follows: a report of actual\r\nreceipts and disbursements for the three fiscal years prior to July 1,\r\n1916; departmental estimates of receipts and disbursements for the\r\ncurrent year 1916-1917; estimated treasury balances as of July 1,\r\n1917; departmental receipts and disbursements for the biennial period\r\nbeginning July 1, 1917; appropriations available beginning July 1,\r\n1913; appropriations requested by the state departments, boards,\r\ncommissions, and institutions for the biennium, beginning July 1,\r\n1917. On January 5, 1917, after hearings and investigations, the Board\r\nof Public Affairs issued a typewritten bulletin with its\r\nrecommendations on the budget. The 344 pages of the budget are\r\nmimeographed and bound.\r\n\r\nThe third biennial report of the Wisconsin Highway Commission deals\r\nwith the state aid highway operations in the years from January 1,\r\n1914, to January 1, 1916, together with preliminary estimates of\r\noperations to December 31, 1916. In the first five years of work under\r\nthe state aid law, 4,846 miles of all types of roadway have been\r\nconstructed in Wisconsin; of this mileage, 2,771 miles have been\r\nsurfaced with various materials; in grading, approximately 10,300,000\r\ncubic yards of earth have been excavated and placed in fills; 8,662\r\nconcrete culverts have been built on these roads, containing 100,000\r\ncubic yards of concrete; since July 1, 1911, 2,819 county and state\r\nbridges have been constructed in accordance with the plans of the\r\ncommission; at the height of the working season in 1916 the daily\r\nemployment in the work included 175 engineers, county highway\r\ncommissioners, and inspectors, 600 foremen, 6,000 laborers, and 2,500\r\nteams. The daily pay roll for state, counties, and towns was in the\r\nvicinity of $22,000. In state aid roads and bridge construction in\r\n1915, there was expended $4,134,830; in 1916, $4,215,183; the report\r\nestimates an expenditure of at least $4,600,000 in 1917. The report\r\ncontains many discussions of phases of the road problem that are of\r\ntimely importance. Many interesting illustrations of the types of\r\nconstruction built under the state aid law are given.\r\n\r\nThe address on John Muir delivered by President Van Hise upon the\r\noccasion of the unveiling of a bronze bust of the famous naturalist at\r\nthe University of Wisconsin has been published as a small eighteen\r\npage pamphlet. At the age of eleven Muir came to America from Scotland\r\nwith his father, and settled on a farm a few miles from Portage. He\r\nspent four years at the University of Wisconsin, maintaining himself\r\nby “doing odd jobs during the term and working in the harvest, fields\r\nin the summer.” In speaking of his departure from Madison, Muir writes\r\nin his book _My Boyhood and Youth_, “But I was only leaving one\r\nuniversity for another, the Wisconsin University for the University of\r\nWilderness.” President Van Hise gives an eloquent account and\r\ninterpretation of the life of this noted son of Wisconsin. “The great\r\npublic service of John Muir,” writes President Van Hise, “was leading\r\nthe nation through his writings to appreciate the grandeur of our\r\nmountains and the beauty and variety of their plant and animal life,\r\nand the consequent necessity for holding forever as a heritage for all\r\nthe people the most precious of these great scenic areas. Probably to\r\nhis leadership more than to that of any other man is due the adoption\r\nof the policy of national parks.”\r\n\r\n_History of the Civil War Military Pensions, 1861-1885_ is the title\r\nof a bulletin recently issued by the University of Wisconsin in its\r\n_History Series_ (vol. 4, no. 1, pp. 1-120). It is the doctor’s thesis\r\nof John William Oliver. As the title indicates it is a survey\r\nbeginning with the reorganization of the pension system as a\r\nconsequence of the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, and it carries\r\nthe study through a period of twenty-four years. Beginning with a\r\ndescription of the situation before the Civil War, the author examines\r\nthe succession of acts passed between 1861 and 1870, and the various\r\nadministrative problems occasioned by the war. “By 1871,” writes Mr.\r\nOliver, “it appears as if Congress had extended the benefits of the\r\npension laws so as to include all possible claimants. Within ten\r\nyears, over 261,000 Civil War pensioners had been added to the rolls,\r\nand the Government had already paid out more than $152,000,000 for\r\ntheir benefit.” The enactment of many contradictory laws led to the\r\ncodification act of 1873. This act is described in the second chapter\r\nof the book, together with attempts at reforming the pension system. A\r\nthird chapter discusses the act passed January 25, 1879, providing for\r\nthe payment of arrears----“the most significant and far-reaching piece\r\nof pension legislation enacted during the period covered” in the\r\nstudy. The effects of this act may be seen in the increase, during the\r\nfirst six years after its passage, of the number of pensioners from\r\n223,998 to 345,125, and in the amount expended annually from\r\n$27,000,000 to $68,000,000. The last chapter of the bulletin deals\r\nwith the relation of pensions and politics, which assumed considerable\r\nimportance in the years following the Arrears Act. At the conclusion\r\nof the thesis, development to 1885 is summarized. A later monograph is\r\npromised, to treat of the new epoch which the pension system then\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nThe biennial report of the Board of Regents of the University of\r\nWisconsin for the years 1914-15 and 1915-16 consists largely of the\r\nreport of the President, followed by reports of deans, directors,\r\nbusiness manager, and other officers. The President’s report contains\r\ntwo main divisions: “The Progress of the University,” and “The Needs\r\nof the University.” The faculty numbered 389 in 1913-14. The number\r\nincreased to 437 in 1915-16. In the year preceding the biennium the\r\ntotal number of students, including the short course and summer\r\nsessions, was 6,765. The number increased to 7,596 in 1914-15, and to\r\n7,624 in 1915-16. Though the survey conducted by the Board of Public\r\nAffairs resulted in controversy, and led to no direct results, yet in\r\nconsequence of a spirit of self-inquiry at the University a large\r\ncommittee was appointed by the faculty in the autumn of 1915, which\r\nwas divided into a number of special committees to consider means of\r\nimproving the University in undergraduate instruction, research,\r\ngraduate, and field work, foreign language requirements, faculty\r\norganization, faculty records, and University physical plant. As a\r\nresult of this inquiry, new legislation to be put in effect during the\r\nnext biennium is expected materially to improve the efficiency of the\r\nUniversity. These subjects are considered in some detail in the\r\nreport. The needs of the University are discussed under the heads of\r\nsalaries, and constructional needs. The varied activities of the\r\nUniversity may be comprehended by a study of the many departmental and\r\nother statements included in the report.\r\n\r\nThe first annual report of the state chief engineer of Wisconsin\r\nissued in March, 1917, reveals the enormous work that has been taken\r\nover by that department. Five separate divisions known respectively as\r\nthe railroad and utility, the highway, the architectural, the power\r\nplant, and the sanitary divisions have been established, and special\r\nexperts placed in charge of each. The railroad and utility division\r\nwas faced with duties greater than those of any other department. In\r\nmaking a physical valuation of all the steam railroads in Wisconsin it\r\nwas found that there are over 11,000 miles of track in the state. The\r\ncost of the rolling stock, terminals, stores, and other equipment\r\nexceeds $385,000,000. The twenty-eight electric railways of the state\r\nhave over 400 miles of track, with properties valued at $57,000,000.\r\nThe state highway division reported that over $3,600,000 had been\r\nexpended for state aid construction of roads in 1916. Over a half\r\nmillion dollars was spent in state aid bridge construction and 352\r\nbridges of all types were built. The architectural division has\r\nformulated a standard for contracts, plans and specifications for\r\nlabor and material to be used by the different institutions of the\r\nstate. The power plant division supervises the operation of the\r\nvarious state plants, the purchase of fuel, specifies the plans for\r\nconstruction work and examines all bids. The sanitary division, aside\r\nfrom conducting the investigation of different water supplies,\r\ndrainage, and sewage systems, is also vitally interested in\r\nenlightening the public upon the importance of sanitation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the _Twentieth Annual Report_ of the Building and Loan\r\nAssociation there are seventy-seven such organizations in Wisconsin.\r\nThe past two years have been unusually profitable for them. Their\r\ntotal assets amount to $16,873,000 which was an increase of $2,500,000\r\nover the previous year. Their membership now numbers 45,891, showing a\r\n21 per cent increase over the preceding year. Although their business\r\nshowed a considerable increase, yet the report states in some cases\r\nmoney was so plentiful that it could not always be loaned with profit.\r\n\r\nThat there exists among the farmers of this state an unusually strong\r\nsystem of coöperation is proved by a bulletin issued by the\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station of the University of Wisconsin in\r\nJuly, 1917. The industries that are managed on a coöperative basis in\r\nthis state do an annual business amounting to more than $62,000,000.\r\nThe creamery industry leads all the others, and in 1916 those plants\r\nthat were run on a coöperative plan did business amounting to over\r\n$19,000,000. The two organizations that are most instrumental in\r\npromoting this spirit of coöperation are the American Society of\r\nEquity and the Grange. The former has a membership in Wisconsin now in\r\nexcess of 12,000, while the Grange societies have over 2,200 names on\r\ntheir rolls. In addition to these two organizations there are sixteen\r\nothers listed that tend to promote unity among the farmers of the\r\nstate. The most important ones mentioned are the National Agricultural\r\nOrganization, the farmers’ mutual insurance companies, the community\r\nbreeders’ associations, feed and elevator companies, coöperative\r\ncreameries, packing plants and others. The coöperative organizations\r\nare so numerous throughout the state that but few farmers can be found\r\nwho are not identified with one or more of the agencies. The day of\r\nindividualism among Wisconsin farmers is fast disappearing.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth edition of the _Manual for Elementary Course of Study_\r\nin the schools of Wisconsin was issued in July, 1917. The state\r\nsuperintendent of public instruction has rendered a valuable service\r\nby discussing many pedagogical questions and in making concrete\r\nsuggestions to the teachers. The object of the department was to place\r\nin the hands of each teacher a brief pedagogical treatise in\r\nconnection with the subject matter to be taught. This report combines\r\nwhat may rightly be called a textbook on pedagogy with a state manual.\r\nMore than ever the department of education is emphasizing the\r\nimportance of bringing about a closer relationship between teacher and\r\npupil, and some very practical and simple suggestions are laid down\r\nfor promoting this relationship. The method for teaching children how\r\nto study properly, the importance of careful assignments of lessons,\r\nand the manner in which recitations can be made interesting and spicy\r\nare all discussed in a practical way. The policy of reducing the\r\nnumber of daily recitations is suggested, and the combining of classes\r\nmost closely related is advised, especially in rooms where the work is\r\ncrowded.\r\n\r\nIn a leaflet issued by the State Council of Defense, July, 1917,\r\nannouncement is made of a course of instruction to be given for health\r\naides in several of the larger hospitals of the state. The plan is to\r\noffer six months of intensive training to young women in order to\r\nprepare them to care for the civilian sick when the regular registered\r\nnurses are drawn into military hospitals. The cost of training, board,\r\nlodging, and laundry bills will all be paid by the State Council of\r\nDefense. In return for this instruction each of the successful\r\ncandidates is required to sign an agreement to attend the sick in the\r\nstate of Wisconsin for a period of two years after completing the six\r\nmonths’ course. The first training school was opened at the Milwaukee\r\nCounty Hospital, Wauwatosa, July 1, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\n  MERK, FREDERICK. _Economic History of Wisconsin During the Civil\r\n    War Decade._ Publications of the State Historical Society of\r\n    Wisconsin _Studies, Vol. I._ Published by the Society, Madison,\r\n    1916. Pp. 414.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Historical Society has inaugurated its series of\r\n_Studies_ by the most elaborate work of constructive history it has\r\npublished, which is also the most comprehensive treatment of the\r\neconomic history of any state during the constitutional period, taking\r\nrank with Bruce’s _Virginia_ and Weeden’s _New England_. The author\r\nhas produced a book which is of interest not only to the state with\r\nwhich it deals, but to every student of American history.\r\n\r\nThe American state, at least today and in the West, is an artificial\r\nunit, whose political separateness barely justifies that exclusive\r\ndevotion of the historical student which the vastness of the United\r\nStates seems to render necessary if the roots of our life are to be\r\ndiscovered. To recognize the influence of national conditions, without\r\nmaking the treatment national, to individualize the community without\r\nmaking it appear a detached entity, requires a variety of skill which\r\ncan not be produced by scientific study alone, but demands also real\r\nliterary ability. This skill Merk clearly possesses, and he has\r\ncreated an impression of an economic life, distinctly confined to the\r\narea of the state, yet part of that of the Union, and in touch with\r\nthat outside the national limits. He is fully conscious of the\r\nimportance of Wisconsin wheat in our relations with Great Britain, and\r\nof the interstate functions of a medium of exchange, but he is not\r\nbetrayed into a discussion of diplomacy or of national banking.\r\n\r\nA similar difficulty is always presented when one attempts a\r\ncross-section of any history, for periods are even more artificial\r\nthan state lines. Economically the “Decade” of the Civil War does not\r\nhave those distinguishing features which are generally used to mark\r\noff, for convenience of study, one set of years from another.\r\nDoubtless the consideration which determined the selection was again\r\nartificial, the United States system of decennial censuses. Mr. Merk,\r\nhowever, allows himself more latitude in this case, and his work\r\nactually covers the real economic period, 1857 to 1873.\r\n\r\nThe chronological difficulty is intensified by the rapid changes of a\r\nnew community. Wheat growing reaches its apex and declines, lumbering\r\nwaxes, but neither begins nor culminates, movements feebly originate\r\nthat are later of absorbing interest. The adjustment of proportions\r\nbetween these conflicting interests is delicately handled. The picture\r\nis that of the time, but the stage in the development of each industry\r\nis clearly indicated, and the origins of later movements given in some\r\ndetail. The volume will afford a base for histories of the earlier and\r\nlater periods, but has not skimmed their cream.\r\n\r\nThe technical character of the work is high. Newspapers and statistics\r\nwere not only used, but are analyzed. The great resources of the State\r\nHistorical Society were supplemented by personal interviews. The\r\nvolume contains ample footnotes, illustrations, a map, index, but no\r\nbibliography. Its make-up is in the new, and more satisfactory, form\r\nrecently adopted by the Society.\r\n\r\nThe title indicates that the center of interest is the effect of war\r\non the Wisconsin community. This problem runs throughout, and is of\r\nespecial interest today. Mr. Merk emphasizes the relative facility of\r\nadjustment in an agricultural community. Another general feature is\r\nthe tendency toward coöperation in industry, particularly agriculture,\r\nfor the purposes of education and general improvement, which later\r\nbecame so characteristic of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nAgriculture properly opens the volume with its vital but somewhat\r\nmonotonous progress enlivened by the lively episode of hops. Lumbering\r\nreceives fewer pages, but two chapters; the first, on the industry,\r\nthe second, on the lumber wars. Railroads receive five chapters and\r\nalmost as many pages as both, including two picturesque fights, which\r\nformed, in large measure, the basis of state politics during the\r\nperiod. Banking and trade about equal agriculture, and reveal a state\r\nyouthful but less reckless than many others. A chapter on labor is\r\nchiefly concerned with the beginnings of the labor movement, labor in\r\nindustry being largely discussed in connection with the various\r\nfields. There are other chapters on mining, manufacturing, the\r\ncommerce of the Upper Mississippi, and the commerce of the Great\r\nLakes. No one reading of the lumber wars or the Anti-Monopoly Revolt\r\ncan complain that economic history is dry.\r\n\r\nThe most unique contribution is doubtless that on the history of\r\nlumbering. Nevertheless the study of railroading reveals the\r\nadvantages in taking up so vast a subject by localities.\r\nGeneralizations become vivid by the detail that is given them. One\r\nsees how the railroads were unscrupulous, how the voters were\r\nunreasonable. The handling of such questions on a scale that involves\r\npersonalities is a searching test of historical poise, and Mr. Merk\r\nshows a candor and a fair-mindedness that are impeccable; he sometimes\r\ncriticizes action, but never impugns the motive.\r\n\r\nThe reviewer hesitates to close without adverse criticism, for fear\r\nthat the review may be considered perfunctory. He could not, with\r\nhonesty, do otherwise than express his conviction that the work is\r\nunusual in the degree and the well-rounded proportion of its\r\nexcellence. If anything more could be desired, it seems to be a\r\nconcluding chapter, not to add new facts, but to give a greater sense\r\nof development. Each chapter moves, but the topical method brings its\r\ninevitable result; one cannot entirely escape the impression of a\r\nstreet corner rather than a river bank.\r\n\r\n                                         CARL RUSSELL FISH.\r\n\r\nTwo of the four leading articles in the October number of the\r\n_American Historical Review_ are by Wisconsin men. Prof. Herbert E.\r\nBolton, now of California, discusses “The Mission as a Frontier\r\nInstitution in the Spanish-American Colonies.” Prof. W. T. Root, of\r\nthe University of Wisconsin, writes of “The Lords of Trade and\r\nPlantations.” Other leading articles in the magazine are “A Case of\r\nWitchcraft” by George L. Kittredge, and “The History of German\r\nSocialism Reconsidered” by Prof. C. J. H. Hayes.\r\n\r\nThe September number of the _Mississippi Valley Historical Review_\r\ncontains three articles of special interest to Wisconsin readers. The\r\nfirst, “The Rise of Sports,” by Prof. Frederic Logan Paxson, curator\r\nof the Society, was delivered as the recent annual presidential\r\naddress before the Mississippi Valley Historical Association. It\r\ntraces in interesting fashion the development in America between 1876\r\nand 1893 of a widespread interest in out-of-door exercise. B. H.\r\nSchockel writes on the “Settlement and Development of the Lead and\r\nZinc Mining Region with Special Emphasis on Jo Daviess County,\r\nIllinois.” The district treated of consisted of Grant, Iowa, and\r\nLafayette Counties in Wisconsin, and of Jo Daviess County, Illinois.\r\nAlthough the latter county affords the particular locus for the study,\r\nit applies with almost equal force to the three counties of\r\nsouthwestern Wisconsin included in the lead mining district. Finally,\r\nProf. James A. James, of Northwestern University, writes on “Spanish\r\nInfluence in the West during the American Revolution.”\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Archeological Society has recently issued two reports,\r\none describing the antiquities of Green Lake, the other describing the\r\nearly Indian remains of Shawano County. The latter report is based\r\nupon the recent surveys made of the Shawano Lake and Wolf River Region\r\nby George R. Fox, a former resident of Wisconsin, but now a curator of\r\nthe Chamberlain Museum in Three Oaks, Michigan. The Society is now\r\nmaking an earnest effort to preserve a fine Indian mound on the shore\r\nof Lake Anderson, in Forest County. This mound, 10 feet high and 45\r\nfeet in diameter, stands at the edge of an old Indian village site and\r\nis the only one in that part of the country. Relic hunters have\r\nalready begun to dig into it, and the state Archeological Society,\r\nrealizing its historic value, is urging the owner to preserve it\r\npermanently and mark it with a descriptive tablet.\r\n\r\nThe first issue of the _Michigan History Magazine_ published by the\r\nMichigan Historical Commission appeared in July, 1917. Like similar\r\nmagazines, its chief purpose is that of serving as an historical news\r\nbulletin, and as a medium of publication for papers of historical\r\ninterest. The first number contains five contributed articles, with\r\nsections devoted to historical news, notes, and comments. One of the\r\nfeatures to be mentioned is that of securing reports from all the\r\ncounty and local historical societies regarding their activities.\r\nSince the local societies cannot support a joint publication, this\r\nmethod offers a good substitute. By this exchange of news, each\r\nsociety is kept in touch with the proceedings of the other. A\r\ncontributed article of more than ordinary merit appears in the first\r\nissue by Rev. F. X. Barth on “The Field for the Historian in the Upper\r\nPeninsula.” Aside from indicating the numerous points of historical\r\ninterest found in the Upper Peninsula, many of which are shared\r\njointly by Wisconsin, the paper presents one of the strongest appeals\r\nfor the value of local history study that can be found anywhere. It is\r\nrecommended to every reader of our Society.\r\n\r\nDr. George N. Fuller, Secretary of the Michigan Historical Commission,\r\nis the author of a new book entitled the _Economic and Social\r\nBeginnings of Michigan_. The study deals with the settlement of the\r\nLower Peninsula during the territorial period from 1805 to 1837.\r\nDoctor Fuller has given special attention to the purely economic\r\nconditions that existed in the Michigan Territory until her admission\r\ninto the Union. It is by far the most interesting and authentic volume\r\non the early history of Michigan that has appeared. The work is richly\r\nillustrated and is printed in large, readable type.\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Historical Commission proposes to reproduce by\r\nphotostatic process the rare files of the _Kentucky Gazette_,\r\n1787-1800, and the Detroit _Gazette_, 1817-1830. Of the former, but\r\none file is known to exist, that in the Lexington Public Library. Of\r\nthe latter file, the Wisconsin Historical Library possesses six bound\r\nvolumes, covering over one-half of the total period. It is proposed to\r\nissue ten sets of each paper for as many subscribing libraries.\r\n\r\nThe Filson Club of Louisville has issued as number twenty-eight of its\r\npublications _The Kentucky River_ by Mary Verhoeff. In this and other\r\nsimilar studies supported by the Filson Club, Kentucky is accumulating\r\na valuable history of her state development. River navigation played a\r\nlarger part in the early history of Kentucky than in almost any other\r\nof the western states. Miss Verhoeff’s chapter on the “Beginnings of\r\nRiver Commerce” contains one of the most interesting discussions of\r\ntrade in the early Ohio Valley that has recently appeared. The study\r\nis profusely illustrated, consisting of six chapters and 257 pages. In\r\nmarked contrast with the expensive volumes that thus far have been\r\nissued by the Filson Club, the present one appears in a most simple\r\ndress with covers of heavy paper.\r\n\r\nMr. A. C. Quisenberry has an interesting article in the September\r\nnumber of the _Register_ of the Kentucky State Historical Society on\r\nthe “History of Morgan’s Men.” There are few chapters in the military\r\nhistory of the Confederacy that compare in interest with the swift,\r\ndashing raids of Generals Morgan and Forrest. There are many\r\nhistorical readers who do not know that the southern forces ever came\r\nnorth of the Ohio during the conflict between the states. But during\r\nthe summer of 1863 the citizens of Indiana and Ohio were given the\r\ngreatest scare they ever experienced when General Morgan led 2,000 men\r\nin a mad dash across these two states and reached Columbia County,\r\nOhio, where surrounded by over 80,000 regulars, volunteers, and home\r\nguards, he surrendered. Mr. Quisenberry’s article gives us a\r\npraiseworthy review of this brilliant raid.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important publications of original documents that has\r\nrecently appeared relating to the southwestern portion of the United\r\nStates and Louisiana Territory is the collection of the official\r\nletter books of Gov. William C. C. Claiborne, edited by Dr. Dunbar\r\nRowland of the Mississippi Historical Society. Governor Claiborne was\r\nperhaps the most important man in the entire Southwest from 1803 to\r\n1817. He touched American life at many vital points, and his\r\ncorrespondence during the years in which he served as Governor of that\r\nvast territory is filled with observations and suggestions that relate\r\nto every important activity of the Southwest. The letters now made\r\navailable for the first time comprise the chief source material from\r\nwhich the history of that significant section of American history must\r\nbe written. The letters fill six octavo volumes, personally edited by\r\nDr. Dunbar Rowland.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of the American frontier and the rapid settlement of\r\nevery habitable portion of the western states, the present generation\r\nof readers welcomes with interest the personal reminiscences of those\r\nwho figured in such epoch-making events. The death of Col. William F.\r\nCody, more widely known as Buffalo Bill, marks the passing of the most\r\nfamous and picturesque character of his time. In his autobiography\r\nentitled _Buffalo Bill’s Own Story_ published by John R. Stanton,\r\n1917, we have a vivid and in many respects an historical work of no\r\nslight importance. Mr. William Lightfoot Visscher who for two score\r\nyears was a boon companion of Colonel Cody adds a chapter dealing with\r\nthe incidents attending the last days of the noted pioneer, and an\r\naccount of his death and burial. No man in all America could approach\r\nColonel Cody in popularizing the events that played so prominent a\r\npart in the passing of the Indian and the westward migration of the\r\nwhites. As scout, Pony express rider, Indian fighter, law maker, and\r\nshowman he became an international character, and the dramatic events\r\nthat marked such a career have passed from the active stage of western\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe September, 1917 issue of the _Georgia Historical Quarterly_ has as\r\nits leading article a biographical sketch of Mrs. Eleanor Kinzie\r\nGordon, of Savannah, recently deceased, granddaughter of John Kinzie,\r\nthe well-known Indian trader of early Chicago. Mrs. Gordon’s father,\r\nJohn Harris Kinzie, was sub-Indian agent for the Winnebago, stationed\r\nat Fort Winnebago for several years prior to 1834. To this frontier\r\nfort her mother, a cultivated New England girl, was brought as a bride\r\nin the year 1830. She is best known to later times by her charming\r\nbook _Wau Bun_, a semi-historical narrative of family traditions and\r\npersonal experiences in the early northwest. Its contents deal for the\r\nmost part with the author’s life at Fort Winnebago and the book may\r\nfairly be regarded as a classic of early Wisconsin literature. Mrs.\r\nGordon, the daughter, was born in Chicago in 1835. In early womanhood\r\nshe married a citizen of Georgia and so for upwards of sixty years her\r\nhome has been in that state.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years Henry Ford has won for himself a place in\r\nthe heart of the American public fairly comparable to that achieved\r\nlong since by Thomas A. Edison, who, like Ford, was a Michigan boy. A\r\ngood biography of Ford would be welcomed, we believe by thousands of\r\nAmericans, not including those who own Ford cars. “Henry Ford’s Own\r\nStory” as told to Rose Wilder Lane (New York, 1917) is a hastily\r\nconstructed narrative put together in characteristic reportorial\r\nfashion and frankly laudatory in character. Nevertheless it presents\r\nthe essential facts about the noted manufacturer’s career, reads\r\ninterestingly, and should at least serve to whet the appetite of the\r\nreading public for a biography which should be really worthy of its\r\nunique subject.\r\n\r\nBulletin of Information No. 87 of the Society, which has recently come\r\nfrom the press, is an account of “The Public Document Division of the\r\nWisconsin Historical Library.” The immediate purpose of the bulletin\r\nis to serve as a guide to our own public document division. The full\r\ntreatment which the author (Mrs. Anna W. Evans, chief of the document\r\ndivision of the library) has given the subject of the bulletin,\r\nhowever, should render it a valuable bibliographic aid to any library\r\nor student who has occasion to deal with American or British public\r\ndocuments. Members and friends of the Society will be pleased to know\r\nthat our collection of public documents is believed to be the best\r\nwest of the Alleghanies and to take high rank among the leading\r\ncollections of the entire country. In the treatise under discussion\r\nthe author has especially sought to emphasize the friendly, human\r\nqualities of the contents of the documents entrusted to her care. She\r\nhas fully succeeded in realizing her aim.\r\n\r\nA history of Sauk County, Wisconsin, it is understood, is shortly to\r\nbe issued by the Lewis Publishing Company of Chicago.\r\n\r\n_A Son of the Middle Border_, by Hamlin Garland, published by the\r\nMacmillan Company of New York, is a narrative of unusual interest to\r\nWisconsin readers. In it the author tells the story of his early life,\r\nfirst on a “coulee” farm in western Wisconsin, later as an emigrant\r\n(with his parents) successively to northern Iowa and the Dakotas. Many\r\nof those of maturer years who read the book will find depicted in it\r\nwith extraordinary clearness scenes and conditions of a life, now\r\nlargely vanished, which they themselves have shared in earlier years.\r\n\r\nA survey made by the United States Department of Agriculture in\r\nDecember, 1916, on the number of silos in this country shows that\r\nWisconsin leads all other states in the Union. Out of a grand total of\r\n333,160, Wisconsin had 55,992. New York was second with 42,846. The\r\npast year saw several thousand more silos constructed in Wisconsin,\r\nand the Agricultural Department of the State Council of Defense\r\nestimates the number will now reach 60,000. The average capacity of\r\nWisconsin silos is 120 tons, while those of New York average but 62\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nThe State Historical Society of Iowa has begun the publication of a\r\nseries of pamphlets issued under the general caption _Iowa and War_.\r\nThe object of the Society is “to present in attractive form a series\r\nof small pamphlets dealing with a variety of subjects relating to\r\ninteresting matters connected with the history of Iowa.” Volume I,\r\nnumber 1, published in July is devoted to an account of “Old Fort\r\nSnelling” by Marcus L. Hansen. Old Fort Snelling belongs to the Upper\r\nMississippi Valley in general and Mr. Hansen’s account of it should\r\npossess as much interest for citizens of Wisconsin as for those of\r\nIowa. “Enlistments from Iowa during the Civil War,” by John E. Biggs\r\nis published in No. 2 for August. No. 3, for September, contains an\r\naccount of “The Iowa Civil War Loan,” written by Ivan L. Pollock.\r\n\r\nSince the declaration of war by the United States upon Germany, the\r\nstudy of military history in this country has practically monopolized\r\nthe attention of historical investigators. The leading article in the\r\n_Iowa Journal of History and Politics_ for July, 1917, deals with\r\n“Enlistments during the Civil War.” Like Wisconsin and other northern\r\nstates, Iowa found herself utterly unprepared for a war. The writer\r\nstates that at the beginning of the conflict in 1861, there was not a\r\nsingle unit of the regular army in Iowa, nor were there any forts or\r\ngarrisons. There was not a military post in the state and the nearest\r\narsenal was in St. Louis. A discussion of the draft and its\r\nadministration in Iowa forms a valuable part of the study.\r\n\r\nC. W. Johnston, a Des Moines lawyer of thirty years standing,\r\n“concluded to discontinue and enter upon a period of travel.” _Along\r\nthe Pacific by Land and Sea_ (Chicago, 1916) contains a series of\r\nbreezy letters which he wrote back to the Des Moines _Register and\r\nLeader_. They contain the reactions of this son of the Middle West\r\ntoward the new environment afforded by a visit, apparently his first,\r\nto various cities on the Pacific coast. Through dint of reiterated\r\nremarks on the subject the reader leaves the book with the not\r\nentirely valid conviction that one of the “certainties” for which Des\r\nMoines bears the palm among her sister cities is that of being the\r\ndirtiest place in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe importance of religious denominations in the growth of our State\r\nand national history is being recognized more and more by historical\r\nstudents. In the _Indiana Magazine of History_, June, 1917, appears an\r\ninteresting article by Rev. Elmo A. Robinson entitled “Universalism in\r\nIndiana.” While the writer deals primarily with the growth of that\r\ndenomination in Indiana, yet mention is also made of the influences of\r\nUniversalism in the other states of the Old Northwest. A review of the\r\nproceedings of the Northwest Conference of Universalists shows that\r\nthe Wisconsin delegates figured prominently in the activities of this\r\ndenomination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CORDELIA A.

P. HARVEY\r\n\r\n\r\nHundreds of loyal women labored devotedly during the Civil War\r\nministering to the needs of the northern soldiers. Of them all, none\r\nworked more effectively or earned a larger measure of appreciation and\r\ndevotion on the part of those she served than Mrs. Cordelia A. P.\r\nHarvey, wife of Governor Lewis Harvey of Wisconsin. After his tragic\r\ndeath by drowning at Savannah, Tennessee, while engaged in a mission\r\nof mercy to Wisconsin’s wounded soldiers, Mrs. Harvey conceived the\r\nidea that it was her duty to carry forward the work that her husband\r\nhad left unfinished. In September, 1862, Governor Salomon appointed\r\nher sanitary agent at St. Louis, and until the end of the war she\r\ncontinued in this service. Some idea of her methods and of their\r\neffectiveness may be gained from the narrative which follows. What the\r\nsoldiers thought of her is sufficiently indicated by the title “The\r\nAngel of Wisconsin,” which they bestowed upon her.\r\n\r\nThe narrative we print is from Mrs. Harvey’s typewritten copy of a\r\nlecture which she delivered following the close of the war. This\r\nmanuscript the owner, Mrs. James Selkirk of Clinton, Wisconsin,\r\npermitted the Wisconsin History Commission to copy a few years since,\r\nand it was made the basis, in large part, of chapters VIII and IX of\r\nHurn’s _Wisconsin Women in the War between the States_, published by\r\nthe commission in 1911. Prior to this the portion of the paper\r\npertaining to President Lincoln was drawn upon by J. G. Holland in\r\npreparing his life of Lincoln. Thus the paper has twice been drawn\r\nupon freely for publication. Notwithstanding this, the complete story\r\nin Mrs. Harvey’s own words is sufficiently interesting and important\r\nto justify its publication at this time. In the preparation of the\r\nnarrative for publication a few changes in punctuation and typography\r\nhave been made, and one paragraph, clearly interpolated for the\r\nbenefit of the lecturer’s younger hearers, has been deleted. These\r\nthings aside, the story is now printed for the first time just as Mrs.\r\nHarvey composed it.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is not well to open too frequently the deep wells of past\r\nsorrow that we may drink the bitter draughts which memory offers.\r\nStill, we would not forget the past--our glorious past--with all its\r\nterrible trials, its untold sufferings, its unwritten history. The\r\nChristian never forgets the dying groans on Calvary that gave to him\r\nhis soul’s salvation; neither can an American citizen forget the great\r\nprice paid for the life and liberty of this nation. Next to love of\r\nGod is love of country.\r\n\r\nIt is not my object to awaken any morbid feelings of sentimental\r\nsorrow, or to open again the deep wounds which time has healed.\r\nNeither do I wish to serve up to an unhealthy imagination a dish of\r\nfearful horrors from which a healthy organization must turn away. I\r\nwould only ask you to look at the shadows a little while, that the\r\nlife and light of peace and plenty which now fill our land may by\r\ncontrast impress upon your hearts a picture more beautiful than any\r\nartist could place on canvas. Shadows always make the light more\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1862 I found myself in Cape Girardeau, where hospitals\r\nwere being improvised for the immediate use of the sick and dying then\r\nbeing brought in from the swamps by the returning regiments and up the\r\nrivers in closely crowded hospital boats. These hospitals were mere\r\nsheds filled with cots as thick as they could stand, with scarcely\r\nroom for one person to pass between them. Pneumonia, typhoid, and camp\r\nfevers, and that fearful scourge of the southern swamps and rivers,\r\nchronic diarrhea, occupied every bed. A surgeon once said to me,\r\n“There is nothing else there: here I see pneumonia, and there fever,\r\nand on that cot another disease, and I see nothing else! You had\r\nbetter stay away; the air is full of contagion, and contagion and\r\nsympathy do not go well together.”\r\n\r\nOne day a woman passed through these uncomfortable, illy-ventilated,\r\nhot, unclean, infected, wretched rooms, and she saw something else\r\nthere. A hand reached out and clutched her dress. One caught her shawl\r\nand kissed it, another her hand, and pressed it to his fevered cheek;\r\nanother in wild delirium, cried, “I want to go home! I want to go\r\nhome! Lady! Lady! Take me in your chariot, take me away!” This was a\r\nfair-haired, blue-eyed boy of the South, who had left family and\r\nfriends forever; obeying his country’s call, he enlisted under the\r\nstars and stripes because he could not be a traitor. He was therefore\r\ndisowned, and was now dying among strangers with his mother and\r\nsisters not twenty miles away; and they knew that he was dying and\r\nwould not come to him. Father, forgive them, they knew not what they\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nAs this woman passed, these “diseases,” as the surgeon called them,\r\nwhispered and smiled at each other, and even reached out and took hold\r\nof each others’ hands, saying, “She will take us home, I know her; she\r\nwill not leave us here to die,” not dreaming that hovering just above\r\nthem was a white robed one, who in a short time would take them to\r\ntheir heavenly home.\r\n\r\nThis woman failed to see on these cots aught but the human [beings]\r\nthey were to her, the sons, brothers, husbands, and fathers of anxious\r\nweeping ones at home; and as such she cared for and thought of them.\r\nArm in arm with health, she visited day by day every sufferer’s cot,\r\ndoing, it is true, very little, but always taking with her from the\r\noutside world fresh air, fresh flowers, and all the hope and comfort\r\nshe could find in her heart to give them. Now and then one would\r\ntotter forth into the open air, his good constitution having overcome\r\ndisease, and the longings for life so strong within him that he\r\ngrasped at straws, determined to live. If perchance he could get a\r\nfurlough, in a few weeks a strong man would return and greet you with,\r\n“How do you do, I am on my way to my regiment!” Who this stranger\r\nmight be, you could never imagine until reminded by him of the\r\nskeleton form and trembling steps you had so recently watched going to\r\nthe landing, homeward bound. But if, as was too frequently the case,\r\nhe was sent to convalescent camps, in a few weeks he was returned to\r\nhospital, and again to camp, and thus continued to vibrate between\r\ncamp and hospital until hope and life were gone. This was the fate of\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nOn a steamer from Cape Girardeau to Helena at table one day when the\r\npassengers were dining, among whom were several military officers, I\r\nheard a young major of the regular army very coolly remark that it was\r\nmuch cheaper for the government to keep her sick soldiers in hospitals\r\non the river than to furlough them. A lady present quietly replied,\r\n“That is true, Major, if all were faithful to the government, but\r\nunfortunately a majority of the surgeons in the army have\r\nconscientious scruples, and verily believe it to be their duty to keep\r\nthese sick men alive as long as possible. To be sure, their uneaten\r\nrations increased the hospital fund and so enabled your surgeons\r\ngenerously to provide all needed delicacies for the sick, but the pay\r\nwas drawn by the soldiers from the government all the same. Don’t you\r\nthink, Sir, it would be a trifle more economical,” continued the lady,\r\n“to send these poor fellows north for a few weeks, to regain their\r\nstrength, that they might return at once to active service?” The\r\nlaughter of his brother officers prevented my hearing his reply.\r\n\r\nThis young officer was the medical director at Helena, where I found\r\nover two thousand graves of Northeners. Two-thirds of these men might\r\nhave been saved, could they have been sent north. The surgeon in\r\ncharge of the general hospital, when asked why he did not furlough\r\nsome of the men from his over-crowded hospitals, replied that he had\r\nat one time and another made out certificates of disability for\r\nfurlough for nearly every man in his hospital and for hundreds who\r\nrested on the nearby hill, but when sent for the signature and\r\napproval of the medical director, they had invariably been returned,\r\ndisapproved; that he had also permitted the men themselves to go with\r\ntheir papers, only to have them severely reproved and ordered back to\r\nhospital, and, said he, with tears in his eyes, “many of them never\r\nreturned, for, broken-hearted, they have lain down by the roadside and\r\ndied.”\r\n\r\nI once heard a person who had been instrumental in giving a dying boy\r\nback to his mother, that she might nurse him back to life, relate how\r\nit was done. The mother had succeeded in getting her son as far as St.\r\nLouis where his papers were to be sent. They came in the usual way to\r\nthe medical director, were all wrong, of course--not made out\r\naccording to army regulations and must therefore be returned to his\r\nregiment, which was somewhere with Sherman and could not be reached.\r\nThe mother received the papers with that fearful word “disapproved”\r\nwritten upon them. There was nothing to do but to place her sick son\r\nin a St. Louis hospital, and leave him there to die; she must return\r\nto her family. She told her story with streaming eyes and a broken\r\nheart. The woman impulsively said, “Give me the papers,” and off she\r\nwent to the medical director’s office. He was a man full six feet\r\nhigh, over fifty years of age, a head like Oliver Cromwell’s, a face\r\nstern as fate, and of the regular army. She entered his presence,\r\nseated herself, and waited to be spoken to.\r\n\r\nSoon it came with, “What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“To talk with you a moment, General,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“No time for talking.”\r\n\r\n“I will wait,” she said.\r\n\r\nHe wrote a few moments, then said, “May as well hear it now as\r\never--what is it?”\r\n\r\n“I would like to ask you if you had a son in this volunteer service,\r\nsent up from the South as far as St. Louis, sick and like to die, and\r\nsome ignorant, careless officer had made out his furlough papers\r\nwrong--”\r\n\r\n“What do you want!”\r\n\r\n“--would you not be glad, if you were away, if your poor boy could\r\nfind a friend?”\r\n\r\n“What do you want, I say? This is nothing to the purpose.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not think that friend ought to do all she could to save your\r\nboy?”\r\n\r\n“What is all this nonsense?”\r\n\r\n“Only this: a poor mother is at the Soldiers’ Home with her dying son.\r\nThe physicians say he may live if he is sent north, but will surely\r\ndie if left here. His furlough papers have been sent on, and I have\r\nseen them, and know they are wrong. His regiment is with Sherman on\r\nthe march. Cannot something be done for the boy--for his mother?”\r\n\r\n“We have the army regulations, we cannot go behind them. You know if I\r\ndo, they will rap me over the knuckles at Washington.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that your knuckles were mine. I would be willing to have them\r\nskinned; the skin would grow again, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Where are these papers?” he said sharply.\r\n\r\n“I have them here in my pocket.”\r\n\r\n“Let me see them.”\r\n\r\nThe woman took them slowly out, blank side upwards, and gave them to\r\nhim. He turned them and his face flushed as he said, “Why I have had\r\nthese papers and disapproved them. This is my signature.”\r\n\r\nShe replied tremblingly, “I knew it, but forgive me. I thought maybe\r\nwhen you knew about it, General--and the mother was weeping with the\r\nskeleton arms of her boy around her neck--I thought maybe you would do\r\nsomething or tell me something to do.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose I do approve these papers, it will do no good. The general in\r\ncommand will stop them and censure me.”\r\n\r\n“But you will have done all you could and have obeyed the higher law.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime this truly noble man had firmly crossed out his own\r\nwords and signature, and rewritten under it words of approval, and in\r\na quick, husky tone, said, “Take it and don’t you come here again\r\ntoday.” As the woman raised her eyes to thank him, she saw a scowl on\r\nhis brow, but a smile on his lips, and a tear in his eye.\r\n\r\n“The general in command,” said she in relating the story, “never went\r\nbehind the medical director’s signature. The boy started for home that\r\nnight with his mother, full of hope.”\r\n\r\nNot long after this an incident occurred showing how easily man yields\r\nto the higher law when once he makes humanity his standpoint. An\r\nerring boy of nineteen, who had deserted from a Minnesota regiment,\r\nchanged his name, enlisted in the gunboat service from which he again\r\ndeserted, again changed his name, and enlisted in a Wisconsin\r\nregiment, a little unsteady to be sure, but still a soldier. He was\r\nwounded in a battle, honorably discharged from the service, and paid\r\noff. On Saturday night he reached St. Louis and found his way to one\r\nof her lowest dens, was drugged and robbed of everything he possessed.\r\nOn Monday he was found tossing from side to side stricken by disease.\r\nHis surroundings were terrible, and he was lying on an old, filthy\r\nmattress which had been thrown into the open hall by the frightened\r\ninmates. He was screaming with pain and was at times delirious. As\r\nsoon, however, as he heard the soothing tones of a human voice, and\r\nrecognized the hand of kindness on his burning brow, he cried,\r\n“Mother! Oh, Mother, forgive me, God forgive me! I have sinned. What\r\nshall I do! What shall I do!” Conscience and disease were doing their\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nSoftly speaking to him words of comfort and hope, our friend released\r\nherself from his grasp, promising to return in half an hour to take\r\nhim away. This was easier said than done. This soldier was now a\r\ncitizen, and could not, therefore, be admitted into a military\r\nhospital. His disease was of such a nature that in all probability he\r\nmust die--but his widowed mother, far away, must she know that her\r\ndarling soldier had died in such a place? God forbid! An order must be\r\nhad to place him in a military hospital.\r\n\r\nThe woman goes to her old friend, the medical director, and tells her\r\nstory in as few words as possible, saying, “General, write an order\r\nquick to the surgeon in charge of the Fifth Street hospital, that the\r\nboy may be received. I also want an ambulance, mattress, and bedding,\r\nand some men to help me move him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, but listen, I have no right, I can’t do it.”\r\n\r\n“I know--I know, but please do hurry--I promised to be back in half an\r\nhour, and the boy will expect me.”\r\n\r\nThe general, calling a boy and imitating her voice, said, “Hurry,\r\nhurry, boy! Get the best ambulance we have, a good mattress and\r\nbedding, and some men and go with Madame and do whatever she bids you\r\nto do. Here is the order, what else do you want? Henceforth we do what\r\nyou wish and no questions asked. It is the easiest way and I guess the\r\nonly way to get along with you.” The mother mourned her son’s death,\r\nbut not his disgrace. In after months, this worthy officer by daring\r\nto take responsibility performed many acts which will gladden his\r\ndying hours.\r\n\r\nIn this way, one could be snatched from suffering and death now and\r\nthen, but Oh! the thousands that were beyond the reach of human aid,\r\nand the numbers that no private individual power could help--only the\r\ngreat military power! This conviction first led to the thought of\r\nproviding, if possible, some place where invalids could be sent north,\r\nwithout the trouble of furloughs. The idea of northern military\r\nhospitals seemed practicable and so natural that we never once thought\r\nthe authorities would oppose the movement. For nearly a year this\r\nquestion was agitated and urged with all the force that logic,\r\nposition, and influence could bring to bear; but all in vain. Hope was\r\nwell nigh dead within us.\r\n\r\nThis depression in the South because of the utter failure of the\r\ngovernment to provide a way by which the enfeebled soldiers might be\r\nrestored to strength at last suggested the thought of going directly\r\nto the head, to the President. By sending it up by one authority and\r\nanother, by this officer and that one, we began to feel that the\r\nmessage lost the flavor of truth, and got cold before it reached the\r\ndeciding power; and because it was so lukewarm he spued it out of his\r\nmouth. It is always best if you wish to secure an object, if you have\r\na certain purpose to accomplish, to go at once to the highest power,\r\nbe your own petitioner, in temporal as in spiritual matters, officiate\r\nat your own altar, be your own priest.\r\n\r\nI am going to give you another chapter in my own experience, as it\r\nwas, if I can do so, without the least coloring. There is not a more\r\ndifficult task than that of relating simple facts in such a manner as\r\nto convey an entirely correct impression. The difficulty is increased\r\nwhen the relator is an interested party. I trust I shall not be\r\naccused of egotism if I give the exact conversations between Mr.\r\nLincoln and myself, as taken down at the time, for in no other way can\r\nI so well picture to you our much loved and martyred president as he\r\nthen appeared at the White House. As I said before, the necessity for\r\nestablishing military hospitals in the North had long been a subject\r\nof much thought among our people, but it was steadily opposed by the\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nBy the advice of friends and with an intense feeling that something\r\nmust be done, I went to Washington. I entered the White House, not\r\nwith fear and trembling, but strong and self-possessed, fully\r\nconscious of the righteousness of my mission. I was received without\r\ndelay. I had never seen Mr. Lincoln before. He was alone, in a medium\r\nsized office-like room, no elegance about him, no elegance in him. He\r\nwas plainly clad in a suit of black that illy fitted him. No fault of\r\nhis tailor, however; such a figure could not be fitted. He was tall\r\nand lean, and as he sat in a folded up sort of way in a deep arm\r\nchair, one would almost have thought him deformed. At his side stood a\r\nhigh writing desk and table combined; plain straw matting covered the\r\nfloor; a few stuffed chairs and sofa covered with green worsted\r\ncompleted the furniture of the presence chamber of the president of\r\nthis great republic. When I first saw him his head was bent forward,\r\nhis chin resting on his breast, and in his hand a letter which I had\r\njust sent in to him.\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes, saying, “Mrs. Harvey?”\r\n\r\nI hastened forward, and replied, “Yes, and I am glad to see you, Mr.\r\nLincoln.” So much for republican presentations and ceremony. The\r\nPresident took my hand, hoped I was well, but there was no smile of\r\nwelcome on his face. It was rather the stern look of the judge who had\r\ndecided against me. His face was peculiar; bone, nerve, vein, and\r\nmuscle were all so plainly seen; deep lines of thought and care were\r\naround his mouth and eyes. The word “justice” came into my mind, as\r\nthough I could read it upon his face--I mean that extended sense of\r\nthe word that comprehends the practice of every virtue which reason\r\nprescribes and society should expect. The debt we owe to God, to man,\r\nto ourselves, when paid, is but a simple act of justice, a duty\r\nperformed. This attribute seemed the source of Mr. Lincoln’s strength.\r\nHe motioned me to a chair. I sat, and silently read his face while he\r\nwas reading a paper written by one of our senators, introducing me and\r\nmy mission. When he had finished reading this he looked up, ran his\r\nfingers through his hair, well silvered, though the brown then\r\npredominated; his beard was more whitened.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he looked at me with a good deal of sad severity and said,\r\n“Madam, this matter of northern hospitals has been talked of a great\r\ndeal, and I thought it was settled, but it seems not. What have you\r\ngot to say about it?”\r\n\r\n“Only this, Mr. Lincoln, that many soldiers in our western army on the\r\nMississippi River must have northern air or die. There are thousands\r\nof graves all along our southern rivers and in the swamps for which\r\nthe government is responsible, ignorantly, undoubtedly, but this\r\nignorance must not continue. If you will permit these men to come\r\nnorth you will have ten men where you have one now.”\r\n\r\nThe president could not see the force or logic in this last argument.\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders and said, “If your reasoning were correct,\r\nit would be a good argument.” I saw that I had misspoken. “I don’t see\r\nhow,” he continued, “sending one sick man north is going to give us in\r\na year ten well ones.”\r\n\r\nA quizzical smile played over his face at my slight embarrassment.\r\n“Mr. Lincoln, you understand me, I think. I intended to say, if you\r\nwill let the sick come north, you will have ten well men in the army\r\none year from today, where you have one well one now; whereas, if you\r\ndo not let them come north, you will not have one from the ten, for\r\nthey will all be dead.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I understand you; but if they are sent north, they will\r\ndesert; where is the difference?”\r\n\r\n“Dead men cannot fight,” I answered, “and they may not desert.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln’s eye flashed as he replied, “A fine way, a fine way to\r\ndecimate the army, we should never get a man of them back, not one,\r\nnot one.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, but you must pardon me when I say you are mistaken; you do\r\nnot understand our people. You do not trust them sufficiently. They\r\nare as true and as loyal to the government as you say. The loyalty is\r\namong the common soldiers and they have ever been the chief\r\nsufferers.”\r\n\r\n“This is your opinion,” he said with a sort of a sneer. “Mrs. Harvey,\r\nhow many men do you suppose the government was paying in the Army of\r\nthe Potomac at the battle of Antietam, and how many men do you suppose\r\ncould be got for active service at that time? I wish you would give a\r\nguess.”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing of the Army of the Potomac, only there were some noble\r\nsacrifices there. When I spoke of loyalty, I referred to our western\r\narmy.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now, give a guess. How many?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot, Mr. President.”\r\n\r\nHe threw himself around in the chair, one leg over the arm, and again\r\nspoke slowly: “This war might have been finished at that time if every\r\nman had been in his place that was able to be there, but they were\r\nscattered hither and thither over the North, some on furloughs, and in\r\none way or another, gone; so that out of 170,000 men which the\r\ngovernment was paying at that time, only 83,000 could be got for\r\naction. The consequences, you know, proved nearly disastrous.”\r\n\r\n“It was very sad but the delinquents were certainly not in northern\r\nhospitals, neither were they deserters therefrom, for there are none.\r\nThis is, therefore, no argument against them.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, Mrs. Harvey, you go and see the Secretary of War and talk\r\nwith him and hear what he has to say.” This he said thoughtfully, and\r\ntook up the letter I had given him, and after writing something on the\r\nback of it gave it to me.\r\n\r\n“May I return to you, Mr. Lincoln?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” he replied, and his voice was gentler than it had been\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nI left him for the war department. I found written on the back of the\r\nletter these words, “Admit Mrs. Harvey at once; listen to what she\r\nsays; she is a lady of intelligence and talks sense. A. Lincoln.” Not,\r\nof course, displeased with the introduction, I went on my way to Mr.\r\nStanton, our secretary of war, about whose severity I had heard so\r\nmuch that I must confess I dreaded the interview; but I was kindly\r\nreceived, listened to respectfully, and answered politely. And let me\r\nsay here, as a passing tribute to this great and good man, that I\r\nnever knew a clearer brain, a truer heart, a nobler spirit than Edwin\r\nM. Stanton. I have watched him by the hour, listening to and deciding\r\nquestions of minor moment as well as those of greater importance--those\r\nupon which the fate of the nation depended, and yet he never wavered.\r\nQuick to see the right, he never hesitated to act. His foresight and\r\nhis strength seemed at times more than human. His place as a statesman\r\nwill not be filled in this century.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my interview with him. After understanding the object\r\nfor which I came, he told me he had sent the Surgeon-General to New\r\nOrleans with directions to come up the river and examine all\r\nhospitals. In short, I understood he had started on a tour of\r\ninspection, which meant nothing at all so far as the suffering was\r\nconcerned. I told Mr. Stanton, “Our western hospitals have never\r\nreceived any benefit from these inspections, and we have very little\r\nconfidence that any good would result from them. Any person with\r\ndiscernment, with a medium allowance of common sense and humanity, who\r\nis loyal, and has been through our southern river hospitals, knows and\r\nfeels the necessity for what I ask, and yet you say you have never\r\nreceived a report to this effect. The truth is, the medical\r\nauthorities know the heads of departments do not wish hospitals\r\nestablished so far away from army lines, and report accordingly. I\r\nwish this could be overruled; can nothing be done?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, until the Surgeon-General returns,” Mr. Stanton replied.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” I said, and left him, not at all disappointed.\r\n\r\nReturning to Mr. Lincoln, I found it was past the usual hour for\r\nreceiving and no one was in the waiting-room. The messenger said I had\r\nbetter go directly into the President’s room. It would be more\r\ncomfortable waiting there, and there was only one gentleman with him\r\nand he would soon be through. I found my way to the back part of the\r\nroom, and seated myself on a sofa in such a position that the desk was\r\nbetween Mr. Lincoln and me. I do not think that he knew I was there.\r\nThe gentleman with him had given him a paper. The President looked at\r\nit carefully and said, “Yes, this is sufficient endorsement for\r\nanybody; what do you want?”\r\n\r\nI could not hear the reply distinctly, but the promotion of somebody\r\nin the army, either a son or a brother, was strongly urged. I heard\r\nthe words, “I see there are no vacancies among brigadiers, from the\r\nfact that so many colonels are commanding brigades.”\r\n\r\nAt this the President threw himself forward in his chair in such a\r\nmanner as to show me the most curious, comical face in the world. He\r\nwas looking the man straight in the eye, with the left hand raised to\r\na horizontal position, and his right hand patting it coaxingly, and\r\nsaid, “My friend, let me tell you something; you are a farmer, I\r\nbelieve; if not, you will understand me. Suppose you had a large\r\ncattle yard, full of all sorts of cattle, cows, oxen, and bulls, and\r\nyou kept selling your cows and oxen, taking good care of your bulls;\r\nbye and bye, you would find that you had nothing but a yard full of\r\nold bulls, good for nothing under heaven, and it will be just so with\r\nmy army if I don’t stop making brigadier generals.” The man was\r\nanswered; he could scarcely laugh, though he tried to do so, but you\r\nshould have seen Mr. Lincoln laugh--he laughed all over, and fully\r\nenjoyed the point if no one else did. The story, if not elegant, was\r\ncertainly apropos.\r\n\r\nAs I commenced to tell you everything I remember of this singular man,\r\nthis must fill its place. The gentleman soon departed, fully\r\nsatisfied, I doubt not, for it was a saying at Washington when one met\r\na petitioner, “Has Mr. Lincoln told you a story? If he has, it is all\r\nday with you. He never says ‘yes’ after a story.”\r\n\r\nI stepped forward as soon as the door closed. The President motioned\r\nto a chair near him. “Well, what did the Secretary of War say?”\r\n\r\nI gave a full account of the interview, and then said, “I have nowhere\r\nelse to go but to you.”\r\n\r\nHe replied earnestly, “Mr. Stanton knows very well that there is an\r\nacting surgeon-general here, and that Hammond will not be back these\r\ntwo months. I will see the Secretary of War myself, and you come in\r\nthe morning.”\r\n\r\nI arose to take leave, when he bade me not to hasten, spoke kindly of\r\nmy work, said he fully appreciated the spirit in which I came. He\r\nsmiled pleasantly and bade me good evening.\r\n\r\nAs I left the White House, I met Owen Lovejoy who greeted me cordially\r\nand asked, “How long are you going to stay here?”\r\n\r\n“Until I get what I came after,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“That’s right, that’s right; go on, I believe in the final\r\nperseverance of the saints.”\r\n\r\nI have never forgotten these words, perhaps it is because they were\r\nthe last I ever heard him utter.\r\n\r\nI returned in the morning, full of hope, thinking of the pleasant face\r\nI had left the evening before, but no smile greeted me. The President\r\nwas evidently annoyed by something, and waited for me to speak, which\r\nI did not do. I afterward learned his annoyance was caused by a woman\r\npleading for the life of a son who was sentenced to be shot for\r\ndesertion under very aggravating circumstances.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he said, “Well,” with a peculiar contortion of face I\r\nnever saw in anybody else.\r\n\r\nI replied, “Well,” and he looked at me a little astonished, I fancied,\r\nand said, “Have you nothing to say?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, Mr. President, until I hear your decision. You bade me come\r\nthis morning; have you decided?”\r\n\r\n“No, but I believe this idea of northern hospitals is a great humbug,\r\nand I am tired of hearing about it.” He spoke impatiently.\r\n\r\nI replied, “I regret to add a feather’s weight to your already\r\noverwhelming care and responsibility. I would rather have stayed at\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\nWith a kind of half smile, he said, “I wish you had.”\r\n\r\nI answered him as though he had not smiled. “Nothing would have given\r\nme greater pleasure; but a keen sense of duty to this government,\r\njustice and mercy to its most loyal supporters, and regard for your\r\nhonor and position made me come. The people cannot understand why\r\ntheir friends are left to die when with proper care they might live\r\nand do good service for their country. Mr. Lincoln, I believe you will\r\nbe grateful for my coming.” He looked at me intently; I could not tell\r\nif he were annoyed or not, and as he did not speak, I continued: “I do\r\nnot come to plead for the lives of criminals, not for the lives of\r\ndeserters, not for those who have been in the least disloyal. I come\r\nto plead for the lives of those who were the first to hasten to the\r\nsupport of this government, who helped to place you where you are,\r\nbecause they trusted you. Men who have done all they could, and now\r\nwhen flesh, and nerve, and muscle are gone, still pray for your life\r\nand the life of this republic. They scarcely ask for that for which I\r\nplead--they expect to sacrifice their lives for their country. Many on\r\ntheir cots, faint, sick, and dying, say, ‘We would gladly do more, but\r\nI suppose that is all right.’ I know that a majority of them would\r\nlive and be strong men again if they could be sent north. I say I\r\nknow, because when I was sick among them last spring, surrounded by\r\nevery comfort, with the best of care, and determined to get well, I\r\ngrew weaker day by day, until, not being under military law, my\r\nfriends brought me north. I recovered entirely, simply by breathing\r\nnorthern air.”\r\n\r\nWhile I was speaking the expression of Mr. Lincoln’s face had changed\r\nmany times. He had never taken his eye from me. Now every muscle in\r\nhis face seemed to contract, and then suddenly expand. As he opened\r\nhis mouth you could almost hear them snap as he said, “You assume to\r\nknow more than I do,” and closed his mouth as though he never expected\r\nto open it again, sort of slammed it to.\r\n\r\nI could scarcely reply. I was hurt, and thought the tears would come,\r\nbut rallied in a moment and said, “You must pardon me, Mr. President,\r\nI intend no disrespect, but it is because of this knowledge, because I\r\ndo know what you do not know, that I come to you. If you knew what I\r\ndo and had not ordered what I ask for, I should know that an appeal to\r\nyou would be vain; but I believe the people have not trusted you for\r\nnaught. The question only is whether you believe me or not. If you\r\nbelieve me you will give me hospitals, if not, well--”\r\n\r\nWith the same snapping of muscle he again said, “You assume to know\r\nmore than surgeons do.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! Mr. Lincoln, I could not perform an amputation nearly as well\r\nas some of them do; indeed, I do not think I could do it at all. But\r\nthis is true--I do not come here for your favor, I am not an aspirant\r\nfor military honor. While it would be the pride of my life to be able\r\nto win your respect and confidence, still, this I can waive for the\r\ntime being. Now the medical authorities know as well as I do that you\r\nare opposed to establishing northern military hospitals, and they\r\nreport to please you; they desire your favor. I come to you from no\r\ncasual tour of inspection, passing rapidly through the general\r\nhospitals, in the principal cities on the river, with a cigar in my\r\nmouth and a rattan in my hand, talking to the surgeon in charge of the\r\nprice of cotton and abusing the generals in our army for not knowing\r\nand performing their duty better, and finally coming into the open\r\nair, with a long-drawn breath as though just having escaped\r\nsuffocation, and complacently saying, ‘You have a very fine hospital\r\nhere; the boys seem to be doing very well, a little more attention to\r\nventilation is perhaps desirable.’\r\n\r\n“It is not thus; I have visited the hospitals, but from early morning\r\nuntil late at night sometimes. I have visited the regimental and\r\ngeneral hospitals on the Mississippi River from Quincy to Vicksburg,\r\nand I come to you from the cots of men who have died, who might have\r\nlived had you permitted. This is hard to say, but it is none the less\r\ntrue.”\r\n\r\nDuring the time that I had been speaking Mr. Lincoln’s brow had become\r\nvery much contracted, and a severe scowl had settled over his whole\r\nface. He sharply asked how many men Wisconsin had in the field, that\r\nis, how many did she send? I replied, “About 50,000, I think, I do not\r\nknow exactly.”\r\n\r\n“That means she has about 20,000 now.” He looked at me, and said, “You\r\nneed not look so sober, they are not all dead.”\r\n\r\nI did not reply. I had noticed the veins in his face filling full\r\nwithin a few moments, and one vein across his forehead was as large as\r\nmy little finger, and it gave him a frightful look.\r\n\r\nSoon, with a quick, impatient movement of his whole frame, he said, “I\r\nhave a good mind to dismiss every man of them from the service and\r\nhave no more trouble with them!”\r\n\r\nI was surprised at his lack of self-control, and I knew he did not\r\nmean one word of what he said, but what would come next? As I looked\r\nat him, I was troubled, fearing I had said something wrong. He was\r\nvery pale.\r\n\r\nThe silence was painful, and I said as quietly as I could, “They have\r\nbeen faithful to the government; they have been faithful to you; they\r\nwill still be loyal to the government, do what you will with them; but\r\nif you will grant my petition you will be glad as long as you live.\r\nThe prayer of grateful hearts will give you strength in the hour of\r\ntrial, and strong and willing arms will return to fight your battles.”\r\n\r\nThe President bowed his head, and with a look of sadness I can never\r\nforget, said, “I never shall be glad any more.” All severity had\r\npassed from his face. He seemed looking backward and heartward, and\r\nfor a moment he seemed to forget he was not alone; a more than mortal\r\nanguish rested on his face.\r\n\r\nThe spell must be broken, so I said, “Do not speak so, Mr. President.\r\nWho will have so much reason to rejoice when the government is\r\nrestored, as it will be?”\r\n\r\n“I know, I know,” he said, placing a hand on each side and bowing\r\nforward, “but the springs of life are wearing away.”\r\n\r\nI asked if he felt his great cares were injuring his health.\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied, “not directly, perhaps.”\r\n\r\nI asked if he slept well, and he said he never was a good sleeper,\r\nand, of course, slept less now than ever before. He said the people\r\ndid not yet appreciate the magnitude of this rebellion, and that it\r\nwould be a long time before the end.\r\n\r\nI began to feel I was occupying time valuable to him and belonging to\r\nhim. As I arose to take leave, I said, “Have you decided upon your\r\nanswer to the object of my visit?”\r\n\r\nHe replied, “No. Come tomorrow morning. No, it is [cabinet] meeting\r\ntomorrow--yes, come tomorrow at twelve o’clock, there is not much for\r\nthe cabinet to do tomorrow.” He arose and bade me a cordial\r\ngoodmorning.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I arose with a terribly depressed feeling that\r\nperhaps I was to fail in the object for which I came. I found myself\r\nconstantly looking at my watch and wondering if twelve o’clock would\r\never come. At last I ascended the steps of the White House as all\r\nvisitors were being dismissed, because the President would receive no\r\none on that day. I asked the messenger if that meant me, and he said,\r\n“No. The President desires you to wait for the cabinet will soon\r\nadjourn.” I waited, and waited, and waited, three long hours and more,\r\nduring which time the President sent out twice, saying the cabinet\r\nwould soon adjourn, that I was to wait. I was fully prepared for\r\ndefeat, and every word of my reply was chosen and carefully placed. I\r\nwalked the rooms and studied an immense map that covered one side of\r\nthe reception room. I listened, and at last heard many footsteps--the\r\ncabinet had adjourned. Mr. Lincoln did not wait to send for me but\r\ncame directly into the room where I was. It was the first time I had\r\nnoticed him standing. He was very tall and moved with a shuffling,\r\nawkward motion.\r\n\r\nHe came forward, rubbing his hands, and saying, “My dear Madam, I am\r\nvery sorry to have kept you waiting. We have but this moment\r\nadjourned.”\r\n\r\nI replied, “My waiting is no matter, but you must be very tired, and\r\nwe will not talk tonight.”\r\n\r\nHe said, “No. Sit down,” and placed himself in a chair beside me, and\r\nsaid, “Mrs. Harvey, I only wish to tell you that an order equivalent\r\nto granting a hospital in your state has been issued nearly\r\ntwenty-four hours.”\r\n\r\nI could not speak, I was so entirely unprepared for it. I wept for\r\njoy, I could not help it. When I could speak I said, “God bless you. I\r\nthank you in the name of thousands who will bless you for the act.”\r\nThen, remembering how many orders had been issued and countermanded, I\r\nsaid, “Do you mean, really and truly, that we are going to have a\r\nhospital now?”\r\n\r\nWith a look full of humanity and benevolence, he said, “I do most\r\ncertainly hope so.” He spoke very emphatically, and no reference was\r\nmade to any previous opposition. He said he wished me to come and see\r\nhim in the morning and he would give me a copy of the order.\r\n\r\nI was so much agitated I could not talk with him. He noticed it and\r\ncommenced talking upon other subjects. He asked me to look at the map\r\nbefore referred to, which, he said, gave a very correct idea of the\r\nlocality of the principal battle grounds of Europe. “It is a fine\r\nmap,” he said, pointing out Waterloo and the different battle fields\r\nof the Crimea, then, smiling, said, “I am afraid you will not like it\r\nas well when I tell you whose work it is.”\r\n\r\nI replied, “It is well done, whosever it may be. Who did it, Mr.\r\nLincoln?”\r\n\r\n“McClellan, and he certainly did do this well. He did it while he was\r\nat West Point.” There was nothing said for awhile. Perhaps he was\r\nbalancing in his own mind the two words which were then agitating the\r\nheart of the American people, words which have ever throbbed the great\r\nheart of nations, words whose power every individual has\r\nrecognized--“success,” and “failure.”\r\n\r\nI left shortly after with the promise to call next morning, as he\r\ndesired me to do, at nine o’clock. I suppose the excitement caused the\r\nintense suffering of that night. I was very ill and it was ten o’clock\r\nthe next morning before I was able to send for a carriage to keep my\r\nappointment with the President. It was past the hour; more than fifty\r\npersons were in the waiting room. I did not expect an audience, but\r\nsent in my name and said I would call again. The messenger said, “Do\r\nnot go, I think the President will see you now.”\r\n\r\nI had been but a moment among anxious, expectant, waiting faces, when\r\nthe door opened and the voice said, “Mrs. Harvey, the President will\r\nsee you now.” I arose, not a little embarrassed to be gazed at so\r\ncuriously by so many with a look that said as plainly as words could,\r\n“Who are you?” As I passed the crowd, one person said, “She has been\r\nhere every day, and what is more, she is going to win.”\r\n\r\nI entered the presence of Mr. Lincoln for the last time. He smiled\r\nvery graciously and drew a chair near him, and said, “Come here and\r\nsit down.” He had a paper in his hand which he said was for me to\r\nkeep. It was a copy of the order just issued. I thanked him, not only\r\nfor the order but for the manner and spirit in which it had been\r\ngiven, then said I must apologize for not having been there at nine\r\no’clock as he desired me to be, but that I had been sick all night.\r\n\r\nHe looked up with, “Did joy make you sick?”\r\n\r\nI said, “I don’t know, very likely it was the relaxation of nerve\r\nafter intense excitement.”\r\n\r\nStill looking at me he said, “I suppose you would have been mad if I\r\nhad said no?”\r\n\r\nI replied, “No, Mr. Lincoln, I should have been neither angry nor\r\nsick.”\r\n\r\n“What would you have done?” he asked curiously. “I should have been\r\nhere at nine o’clock, Mr. President.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” he laughingly said, “I think I acted wisely, then,” and\r\nsuddenly looking up, “Don’t you ever get angry?” he asked, “I know a\r\nlittle woman not very unlike you who gets mad sometimes.”\r\n\r\nI replied, “I never get angry when I have an object to gain of the\r\nimportance of the one under consideration; to get angry, you know,\r\nwould only weaken my cause, and destroy my influence.”\r\n\r\n“That is true, that is true,” he said, decidedly. “This hospital I\r\nshall name for you.”\r\n\r\nI said, “No, but if you would not consider the request indelicate, I\r\nwould like to have it named for Mr. Harvey.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, just as well, it shall be so understood if you prefer it. I\r\nhonored your husband, and felt his loss, and now let us have this\r\nmatter settled at once.”\r\n\r\nHe took a card and wrote a few words upon it, requesting the Secretary\r\nof War to name the hospital “Harvey Hospital,” in memory of my\r\nhusband, and to gratify me he gave me the card, saying, “Now do you\r\ntake that directly to the Secretary of War and have it understood.” I\r\nthanked him, but did not take it to Mr. Stanton. The hospital was\r\nalready named. I expressed a wish that he might never regret his\r\npresent action, and said I was sorry to have taken so much of his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, you need not be,” he said kindly.\r\n\r\n“You will not wish to see me again, Mr. President.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say that and shall not.”\r\n\r\nI said, “You have been very kind to me and I am grateful for it.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me from under his eyebrows and said, “You almost think me\r\nhandsome, don’t you?”\r\n\r\nHis face then beamed with such kind benevolence and was lighted by\r\nsuch a pleasant smile that I looked at him, and with my usual impulse,\r\nsaid, clasping my hands together, “You are perfectly lovely to me,\r\nnow, Mr. Lincoln.” He colored a little and laughed most heartily.\r\n\r\nAs I arose to go, he reached out his hand, that hand in which there\r\nwas so much power and so little beauty, and held mine clasped and\r\ncovered in his own. I bowed my head and pressed my lips most\r\nreverently upon the sacred shield, even as I would upon my country’s\r\nshrine. A silent prayer went up from my heart, “God bless you, Abraham\r\nLincoln.” I heard him say goodbye, and I was gone. Thus ended the most\r\ninteresting interview of my life with one of the most remarkable men\r\nof the age.\r\n\r\nMy impressions of him had been so varied, his character had assumed so\r\nmany different phases, his very looks had changed so frequently and so\r\nentirely, that it almost seemed to me I had been conversing with half\r\na dozen different men. He blended in his character the most yielding\r\nflexibility with the most unflinching firmness, child-like simplicity\r\nand weakness with statesmanlike wisdom and masterly strength, but over\r\nand around all was thrown the mantle of an unquestioned integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUTCH SETTLEMENTS OF SHEBOYGAN COUNTY\r\n\r\nBY SIPKO F. REDERUS\r\n\r\n\r\nDutch settlements have never been numerous in America or in any other\r\ncountry not flying the Dutch flag. The Hollanders, unlike their German\r\nand British neighbors, have no natural inclination to roaming and\r\nadventure; and being strongly attached to their native soil they have\r\npreferred attempting to improve conditions at home to hazarding their\r\nfortune in a foreign country. This love of country has changed the\r\nNetherlands from a boggy land to a beautiful, productive country with\r\nan intelligent, industrious, and artistic people now numbering about\r\nsix millions.\r\n\r\nUnusual conditions, political, economic, and religious, have, however,\r\nfrom time to time caused Hollanders to emigrate to foreign lands, and\r\nduring the decade 1840-50 many set sail for the United States. After\r\nthe fall of Napoleon the Netherlands had changed from a republican to\r\na limited monarchical form of government. Belgium reunited with\r\nHolland under the name of Kingdom of Netherlands, with William I, son\r\nof the former Dutch stadtholder, as king. The union was not\r\nsuccessful, and the rebellion of 1830, which resulted in the\r\nseparation of Holland and Belgium, necessitated large armies which\r\nWilliam I kept up for years in the hope of reconquering Belgium. Then\r\nin 1825 an inundation of the ocean swept away the dikes, devastated\r\nthe land, and left thousands homeless and without resources. With the\r\nabdication of William I and the accession of his son, William II,\r\nconditions did not improve. War and flood turned the thoughts of the\r\nsuffering lower and middle classes to emigration, and the period from\r\n1840 to 1850 saw the great exodus of Dutch to America.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PETER DAAN\r\n  Pioneer Dutch Settler in Oostburg, Sheboygan County, Wisconsin]\r\n\r\nReligious difficulties arising at this time also caused the emigration\r\nof several distinct groups. With the separation of Holland from Spain\r\ncame separation from the civil and religious rule of the Catholic\r\nChurch and the adoption of the Reformed Church by the State. The Dutch\r\nReformed Church was Calvinistic in doctrine and Presbyterian in\r\ngovernment. German philosophy and French liberalism gradually\r\ninfluenced the lives of members of the State Church; and the monarch\r\nand other governmental officers being friendly toward the new thought,\r\nthe church synods permitted certain changes in the service and\r\ndoctrine. Again and again the orthodox party tried to overthrow the\r\nnew order, and after many failures in such attempts left the\r\nestablished church to form a separate ecclesiastical body called the\r\nFree Separate Reformed Church.\r\n\r\nThe civil government, fearing that civil revolution would follow this\r\nreligious upheaval, opposed the new church, forbade meetings, and\r\nfined ministers. With the accession of William II the organization was\r\nrecognized as a corporate body, but many restrictions were imposed\r\nupon it and financial aid, granted other denominations, was refused\r\nit. A large number of the Separatists gladly accepted the terms\r\nimposed, but others, smarting under the restrictions and foreseeing no\r\nrelief in the near future, resolved to emigrate to America.\r\n\r\nThree separate parties, each under a prominent minister, were formed\r\nfor the purpose of founding settlements in the United States. Rev. R.\r\nC. Van Raalte led his people to the eastern shore of Lake Michigan,\r\nwhere they founded settlements which later came to be among the\r\nprosperous communities of Michigan. Among them are Holland, where Hope\r\nCollege was founded, Grand Haven, Muskegon, and Grand Rapids.\r\n\r\nUnder Rev. H. P. Scholte a party of Dutch immigrants went to southern\r\nIowa and settled a large tract of land purchased from the government.\r\nThe city of Pella, where Central College is located, is the center of\r\na number of communities, all of which have prosperous industries and\r\nbeautiful churches of the Reformed faith.\r\n\r\nThe party led by Rev. P. Zonne secured by purchase from the government\r\na section of country bordering on Lake Michigan, some twenty miles\r\nsouth of the present city of Sheboygan. The settlers arrived in the\r\nspring of 1847 after a stormy voyage across the Atlantic, making the\r\njourney inland by way of the Hudson River, Erie Canal, and Great\r\nLakes. In settling this region the Zonne party had been preceded by\r\nother Dutch families. In 1844 Lawrence Zuvelt and his family settled\r\nin a locality four and one-half miles northwest of what later became\r\nthe Zonne settlement, and in 1846 they were joined by G. H. Koltsée\r\nand John Boland and their families.\r\n\r\nA tragic event marked the growth of this settlement. In 1848 the\r\n_Mayflower_, filled with immigrants to Wisconsin, including many\r\nHollanders, had proceeded as far as Sheboygan when fire was\r\ndiscovered. When, in spite of the crew’s efforts, the flames seemed to\r\nbe gaining headway, a panic ensued, and many lost their lives in the\r\nfire or in the water. Others were landed in pitiful condition on the\r\nshores of Wisconsin. Three Hollanders, Wilterdenk, Oonk, and Rensink\r\nby name, were among those rescued. Wilterdenk had lost his wife and\r\nsix children in the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe Zonne community rapidly overtook the earlier settlement in size\r\nand development. Cedar Grove was the name given it by Reverend Zonne,\r\nbecause cedar formed the greatest part of the forest near by, in\r\nportions of which the Indians still lived. The land was ideal for the\r\npainter, poet, and hunter, but the matter-of-fact Hollanders, though\r\nbelonging to a race which had produced great artists, writers, and\r\nexplorers, had not come to dream, paint pictures, or follow the chase.\r\nThe land was valued by the settlers as a means of material\r\nimprovement; the forest was an obstacle and had to be removed. The\r\nwork of destruction went on systematically from season to season, and\r\nin a short time large clearings could be seen on which were planted\r\nmaize, wheat, and barley. All of these grains gave rich return, for\r\nthe soil was fertile and not easily exhausted.\r\n\r\nClearing the ground for the first crop, however, was a difficult\r\nprocess. How to remove the trees after they had been felled with such\r\ndifficulty was a problem. The settlers could not use all the wood for\r\nfuel nor could they convert the tree trunks into lumber. To dispose of\r\nthe superabundance of wood, these pioneer farmers had to set it on\r\nfire, being careful to remove the immense pile to a safe distance from\r\nthe forest and from the buildings already erected. The hardwood tree\r\nstumps remaining in the fields after the trees had been cut were a\r\ngreat obstacle to cultivation of the ground. Digging the stumps out of\r\nthe field was a long process, and explosives or machinery for doing\r\nthis work were not then available.\r\n\r\nThe forest, however, was a help as well as a hindrance. From the logs\r\nwere made houses and barns, agricultural implements, wagons, and, to\r\nsome extent, furniture. The forest possessed an abundance of game,\r\nwild blackberries, strawberries, wild grapes, and maple trees from\r\nwhich the settlers secured their sugar. Autumn brought a harvest of\r\nhickorynuts and walnuts. Cattle thrived in the woodland, and in\r\ncertain parts flocks of sheep could be kept. From the wool the\r\nhousewife knitted stockings and wove the homespun for the family\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\nCommunication with other settlements was extremely difficult. For many\r\nyears the Indian trails and the pathways blazed by the settlers were\r\nthe only roads, tortuous at all times but almost impassable in winter.\r\nThe principal trading posts, such as Port Washington and Milwaukee,\r\nwere far distant from the Zonne settlement--Milwaukee being forty-five\r\nmiles away--and under the best circumstances the slow-moving oxen made\r\na long journey of it. Often the wagons broke down in the middle of the\r\nforest and the men would have to leave their loads in the road and go\r\nback home or to the trading post ahead for assistance. The lack of\r\ncommunication was felt most during sickness and especially epidemics,\r\nfor many a time the physician, after a long, hard journey, would\r\narrive to find his patient dead or beyond help.\r\n\r\nSuch were the difficulties with which these Dutch pioneers contended\r\nduring the first years of their colonization. Their energy and\r\nperseverance, however, defeated one after another. Gradually the farms\r\nwere cleared, the newly established sawmills turned out lumber for\r\nbetter houses and barns; water power was utilized for the running of\r\nflour mills; and stores were established within easy distance.\r\nArtisans joined the settlements, although blacksmiths had been found\r\namong the original settlers. As the forest gradually disappeared, old\r\ntrails were widened, roads were laid out, villages sprang up, and post\r\noffices were established.\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of their growing prosperity the black war cloud\r\ngathered on the southern horizon and cast its shadows over this\r\npeaceful community. Many of the men, whose fathers had obtained\r\nliberty after eighty years of conflict, were aroused, and leaving\r\ntheir plows took up the musket. Sad times now followed, for now and\r\nthen the news reached the settlement that some son or father had died\r\nin battle; but after the years of sorrow the laureled heroes returned\r\nto their firesides and a greater prosperity dawned.\r\n\r\nOne of the men who was conspicuous in the conflict and even more so in\r\nthe days of peace that followed was Peter Daan. He was born in the\r\nNetherlands, in the town of Westkapelle, Province of Zeeland, March\r\n26, 1835. When he was seven years of age his parents emigrated to\r\nAmerica and settled in the town of Pultneyville, New York. Later the\r\nfamily moved to Wisconsin and bought a farm in Sheboygan County, near\r\nthe present village of Oostburg. Peter Daan was one of the first to\r\nvolunteer on the outbreak of the war, and through his influence and\r\neffort caused many to follow his example. In 1867 he commenced his\r\nmercantile business on the Sauk Trail, two and one-half miles east of\r\nOostburg. As that town developed, he moved his business there, built a\r\nlarge store, an elevator, a steam flour mill, and later founded the\r\nbank of which he became president. He held that office until his\r\ndeath. The people, having confidence in his ability and good judgment,\r\nseveral times elected him president of the town. For years he held the\r\noffice of justice of the peace, and because of his amicable manner of\r\nsettling disputes he won the title among the people of “the\r\npeacemaker.”\r\n\r\nAs a young man he became a member of the Presbyterian Church, and\r\nlater was made an elder, an office which he held until he died.\r\nSeveral times his presbytery elected him delegate to the higher\r\necclesiastical councils. In 1873 he was chosen a member of the\r\nWisconsin legislative assembly. His death occurred June 14, 1914.\r\n\r\nAfter the Civil War the settlements entered a period of prosperity\r\ngreater than any experienced before; in fact many of the farmers,\r\nreceiving high prices for their products during the war, laid the\r\nfoundation of their wealth in this period. The villages of Oostburg\r\nand Cedar Grove expanded, and the new town of Gibbsville was founded\r\nthree miles west of Oostburg. There a large flour mill, driven by\r\nwater power, was built, and remains in operation to this day. East of\r\nCedar Grove, on the lake shore, was built a pier where the great\r\nvessels could land. The settlement of Amsterdam, which developed here,\r\nbecame an important trading place for a time but was abandoned when\r\nthe Chicago and Northwestern Railroad entered the territory. Oostburg\r\nand Cedar Grove, in both of which stations were erected, received the\r\nbenefit of the improved communication. Grain elevators and business\r\nhouses of all kinds were erected, and residences increased and\r\nimproved. In the country better farmhouses and more spacious barns\r\nrapidly replaced the primitive log buildings. The acreage of land\r\ncleared, fenced in, and cultivated, increased, and the herds of cattle\r\nand flocks of sheep became more numerous. Along the lake shore a\r\nprofitable fishing industry was developed. Everywhere the result of\r\nhard work and thrift was seen. _Luctor et emergo_ (I struggle and rise\r\nhigher), the motto of the Province of Zeeland from which these Dutch\r\nsettlers had come, represented the achievements of these people as\r\nwell as those of their sturdy ancestors.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of their hard struggle for material improvement these\r\npeople had not been neglectful of religious matters. Upon their\r\narrival, under the leadership of Reverend Zonne they had organized\r\nthemselves into a church and united with the Presbyterian\r\norganization. In the following year, 1848, Reverend Zonne built a\r\nhouse of worship on his own estate and gave it to his congregation.\r\nThis church, built about a mile north of the present site of Cedar\r\nGrove, was the first of the Presbyterian denomination in that region.\r\nIn the course of time another house of worship was built in the\r\nsettlement later known as Cedar Grove by those who were not in harmony\r\nwith Reverend Zonne. This congregation united with the old Dutch\r\nReformed Church of America, founded in New Amsterdam (now New York) in\r\nthe eighteenth century. This is the oldest and wealthiest (in\r\nproportion to size) of all ecclesiastical bodies in America.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 another Presbyterian church was built four and one-half miles\r\nnorth of Cedar Grove on the Sauk Trail. Reverend Van de Schurn was the\r\nfirst pastor and Peter Daan the first elder. This church with its\r\nlarge membership is flourishing today under the pastorate of Rev. C.\r\nVan Griethuizen. A Dutch Reformed church was later established at the\r\nsame place, and others of the same denomination were erected in the\r\nsettlement later becoming the village of Oostburg, and in Gibbsville.\r\n\r\nAll these churches were in the beginning unpretentious log structures;\r\nbut as the people began to amass wealth, the old churches were\r\nreplaced by substantial, attractive buildings surmounted by spires or\r\ntowers for the church bells. Comfortable residences for the pastors\r\nhave been erected on the church premises. All the congregations are\r\nflourishing today; and although they profess far more liberal views\r\nthan their ancestors, the descendants of the early pioneers are\r\nequally devoted to these institutions.\r\n\r\nOf all these churches, the one founded by Reverend Zonne has always\r\nbeen the most prominent, not only because it has the largest\r\nmembership but because it possesses greater historic associations. The\r\nsecond edifice of this organization, a plain frame building without a\r\ntower, was replaced in 1882 by a much larger and more attractive\r\nbuilding, the gift of a pioneer member, J. Lammers. The church is a\r\npicturesque landmark whose spire can be seen for miles. The interior\r\nhas been considerably improved of late, and a pipe organ has recently\r\nbeen installed. An old churchyard is at one side of the church, and\r\nhere lie the remains of the Reverend Zonne and many other early\r\nworthies of the church.\r\n\r\nThe organization has always had a prosperous record, but its greatest\r\ngrowth began in 1882 when Rev. J. J. W. Roth began his pastorate of\r\nmore than thirty-two years. Reverend Roth was born in Capetown, South\r\nAfrica. There he received his collegiate training; and, later coming\r\nto America with his father, he studied theology at the McCormick\r\nInstitute at Chicago, where he was graduated and ordained in 1878.\r\nAfter serving two small churches in Minnesota and Wisconsin, he became\r\npastor of the Presbyterian Church at Cedar Grove. During the first\r\nyear of his ministry the present church was built, and under his\r\npastorate the congregation became strong and prosperous. Since the\r\nyoung people had become deficient in the language of their fathers,\r\nthe introduction of English into the services had become a necessity.\r\nDr. Roth, educated to both languages, preached to his people in both\r\ntongues. On May 1, 1914, Dr. Roth was stricken by apoplexy and\r\nremained unconscious for some days. Although he recovered\r\nconsciousness, he lost the power of speech and the use of his limbs,\r\nand was compelled to end his active services. Since his illness he has\r\nlived in retirement in Cedar Grove.\r\n\r\nDr. Roth is a man of scholarly attainment, being proficient in Hebrew,\r\nLatin, and Greek, and an artist of some ability. The church societies,\r\nall of which he founded, are in a flourishing condition. He was for\r\nyears the leading man in the Milwaukee presbytery, and was several\r\ntimes elected its moderator and delegate to higher ecclesiastical\r\ncouncils. He has been succeeded by Rev. P. Van Straten.\r\n\r\nDuring the past twenty years the growth of the Dutch settlements has\r\nbeen remarkable. The village of Cedar Grove has grown into a thriving\r\ntown with many prosperous business houses, grain elevators, and\r\nfactories. It has a large public school, and a classical academy which\r\nis conducted by the Dutch Reformed Church of America. The bank of\r\nCedar Grove is a flourishing institution founded some ten years ago.\r\nThe deposits are over $300,000.\r\n\r\nThe village of Oostburg has likewise prospered. Peter Daan’s flour\r\nmill has been enlarged; implement, canning, cheese, and condensed milk\r\nfactories have been built. Oostburg and Cedar Grove are connected with\r\neach other, Sheboygan, and Milwaukee by the hourly service of the\r\nMilwaukee Northern Electric Railway. Returns from the planting of\r\nwheat, to which the farmers had devoted their principal attention had\r\ngradually decreased, and barley and rye are being substituted, also\r\npeas and beans which are sold to the canning factories. Many of the\r\nfarmers, however, have turned to cattle raising, dairying, and cheese\r\nmaking as principal agricultural enterprises. In the making of cheese\r\nthe Hollanders of Sheboygan County are recognized as experts and their\r\nbrands are among the best in the state.\r\n\r\nAlways interested in intellectual progress, the Dutch settlers have\r\nbuilt and supported excellent schools, and many are sending their sons\r\nand daughters to colleges. Materially these people have prospered\r\nsince the first band of settlers began to hew down the forest in 1847.\r\nThe thoroughness with which they did cut down all timber is being\r\nregretted at present by those who possess land bare of all but a few\r\ntrees. This generation, however, is planting trees which, it is hoped,\r\nwill soon remedy that great defect.\r\n\r\nIn customs and manner of thinking the new generation differs greatly\r\nfrom the pioneers who started to develop the country. Their language\r\nis fast disappearing in public and in the homes, for only in the\r\nchurch is Dutch even partly used. This may be due to the similarity\r\nbetween the Dutch and the Anglo-Saxon languages which have a common\r\nfactor in the Fresian tongue.\r\n\r\nThe similarity of tongues and, in addition, of the political,\r\nreligious, and economic struggles of the Dutch and the English\r\nsettlers in America has caused the Dutch to be readily absorbed into\r\nthe earlier population. The special characteristics, in addition to\r\nthose common to both English and Dutch, make the Dutch element one of\r\nthe most valuable in the state of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIONEER RECOLLECTIONS OF BELOIT AND SOUTHERN WISCONSIN[97]\r\n\r\nBY LUCIUS G. FISHER\r\n\r\nEDITED BY MILO M. QUAIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first of January, 1837, I arranged with the Fairbanks to leave\r\nthem and locate in either Louisville or St. Louis, and sell their\r\nscales and other goods manufactured by them at Pittsburgh, on\r\ncommission. I returned to Derby and remained there until May, visiting\r\nmy sister Emeline then teaching in Montreal. I left Derby the\r\nfifteenth of May for the South, leaving a few hundred dollars with the\r\nFairbanks and taking some thousands in notes belonging to them to\r\ncollect between Burlington, Vermont, and Buffalo, New York, and from\r\nwhich collections when made I was to take the money due me and remit\r\nto them the balance. I left with my father a fine span of horses,\r\nharness, and wagon with which to follow me with my sisters when I\r\nshould get a home for them. My sister Rosetta had been lame for a year\r\nand was under the care of a physician and surgeon. I left home and\r\nfriends with a sad heart, taking the stage for Burlington, my two most\r\nintimate friends riding the first mile with me. One was Stoddart B.\r\nColby, who was afterwards the leading lawyer of Vermont and who died\r\nRegister of the United States currency and whose wife was burned on\r\nthe _Swallow_ in the Hudson River; the other, Timothy P. Redfield, now\r\none of the judges of the supreme court of Vermont and brother of my\r\nother very dear and most intimate friend, Fletcher Redfield, for many\r\nyears Chief Justice of Vermont. I have never met either of them since.\r\nI had to get out of the stage the first day to steady it over snow\r\ndrifts.\r\n\r\nI reached Troy, New York, the third day and that evening the news came\r\nthere that the banks had suspended specie payment in consequence of\r\nGeneral Jackson’s order to the United States treasurer to remove the\r\nUnited States deposits from the United States Bank to the\r\nSub-Treasury. All banks suspended specie redemption and for the time\r\nno paper money was current or debts paid. All confidence was destroyed\r\nbetween business men, and such a financial panic was never seen before\r\nor since in our country. When I reached Buffalo I had not collected a\r\ncent from $27,000 in notes against the best business men on the line\r\nof the Erie Canal. In Buffalo I collected in bank bills $70. Here I\r\nwas with but little money and all business prostrated. I could not see\r\nin prospect a time when I could hope to engage in the commission\r\nbusiness with success. I had nothing in Vermont to return to. I was\r\nlonely and desolate. Young men were being discharged from stores and\r\nfactories in great numbers, and business men were failing everywhere.\r\n\r\nI met at Buffalo a discharged clerk from a house in New York who was a\r\nnative of Vermont, and was seeking employment. Neither of us knew what\r\nto do or where to go. We had been living at the Mansion House several\r\ndays and on one Sunday morning we walked down to the wharf and saw a\r\nschooner there with her captain on her deck. I asked him if he was the\r\ncaptain and where he was bound. He said he was the captain, that he\r\nwas bound to Chicago, that his schooner was a new one, etc. I asked\r\nthe price of fare in cabin with board to Chicago. He replied $20. I\r\nturned to my friend Whitcombe and said, “Let us go to Chicago; we may\r\nas well go to one place as another.” He replied, “I will go with you.”\r\nI asked the captain when he sailed. He said, “At nine o’clock tomorrow\r\nA. M. if the wind is fair.” I said, “Book us as passengers and we will\r\nbe on board in season.” We sailed June second. No steamboats had\r\nsailed for the upper lakes then, nor until some days later. There was\r\nno railroad west of Syracuse. The harbor was full of ice. Before\r\nleaving Buffalo, I arranged with a merchant who knew me and who was\r\nfrom Vermont (the father of Frank Fenton of Beloit) to furnish me with\r\nprovisions if on my arrival at Chicago I should find any sale for\r\nthem. We were four weeks and two days on the lakes, with head winds\r\nand rough weather most of the time. Captain Clement was a very\r\nagreeable gentleman, young like his passengers, and very social. Our\r\nvoyage was so much enjoyed by me as to have left the most pleasant\r\nmemories of it, although it was an aimless one. We were drifting into\r\nthe dark future without any plans, yet we were happy, full of life,\r\nhad that self-reliance on our own strength and mental endowments that\r\ntook away all anxiety for the future, and enabled us to enjoy the\r\npresent. The feeling was a desperate, devil-may-care one. As I look\r\nback upon the first year of my western life, I wonder that I did not\r\nbecome a reckless and ruined man. Captain Clement was, after this\r\ntrip, a large owner of steamboats on the lakes, some of which he\r\ncommanded; and for several years he has been the treasurer of the\r\nNorth Chicago Rolling Mills and a large stockholder. He landed us in\r\nChicago the night of the third of July, 1837, and we celebrated the\r\nFourth there. Daniel Webster was in Chicago for the first and last\r\ntime in his life.\r\n\r\nA delegation from Milwaukee came to Chicago to invite Webster to visit\r\ntheir city. He had left for the East, and I, finding no encouragement\r\nto go into business in Chicago, took passage in an old steamer with\r\nthis delegation to Milwaukee.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT I FOUND IN CHICAGO\r\n\r\nIn May, 1837, about a month before my arrival, Chicago had elected its\r\nfirst mayor, William B. Ogden. Its population was about 3,000 and was\r\nmostly north of the river. There was a Presbyterian church where the\r\nBoard of Trade stands, in which Rev. Jeremiah Porter preached. The\r\nRussell House on the North Side was the grand hotel, built of brick.\r\nThe Couch brothers had a small hotel on the present site of the\r\nTremont House of the same name, and the City Hotel was built on the\r\ncorner of State and Lake Streets. There were few buildings south of\r\nLake Street. There was a cornfield running south from Washington\r\nStreet and east of State Street. Lots were worth from $100 to $500\r\nthen, but had been worth as many thousands before the panic of 1837.\r\nJohn Wentworth had just started his paper, the Chicago _Democrat_, in\r\na little 7 × 9 wooden building on La Salle Street north of\r\nRandolph.[98] I had a letter of introduction to him and there made his\r\nacquaintance. The first settler, Gurdon S. Hubbard,[99] was here,\r\nWilliam H. Brown, and many other persons with whom I became\r\nacquainted, but most of whom have passed away. Some are here yet, and\r\namong them G. S. Hubbard & Son, S. B. Cobb, Jerome Beecher, and Mr.\r\nCarpenter. Chicago has now a population of 600,000.\r\n\r\nI landed in Milwaukee the sixth of July, 1837. The boat could not land\r\nand we were sent ashore in the small boat, at the mouth of the river,\r\nthen at Chase’s Point,[100] one mile below the present mouth. My\r\nfriend, Ed Whitcombe, was yet with me and on the boat I made the\r\nacquaintance of John H. Tweedy[101] and formed a friendship which has\r\nendured the changes of the last forty-five years. He afterwards\r\nmarried a Fisher from Boston, who descended from the same ancestor\r\nthat I did. I found Milwaukee with a population of about 1,000, the\r\nwest side of the river mostly under water, many of the houses built on\r\nstilts, abandoned, and doors open, most of the population of 1836\r\nhaving left the place by reason of the panic. I remember the Frenchman\r\nand first settler with a squaw wife was there.[102] I stopped at first\r\nat the Milwaukee Hotel, but soon crossed the river to the Leland House\r\nwhere I found my cousin, Dr. L. J. Barber, and remained with him at\r\nthat house. We had not met since we were lads. We soon became warm\r\nfriends. I had but little money and several young men boarding at the\r\nLeland House had often to borrow of me to pay for their week’s\r\nwashing. All had been speculating in lots and were broke. None of us\r\nknew what to do or where to go.\r\n\r\nI remained about a week and decided to cross the country to Galena and\r\ngo to mining for lead. I started in company with two men, one by the\r\nname of Frink and the other Blood. We traveled the first day to\r\nWaukesha where was the first house, occupied by a Mr. Pratt.[103] It\r\nwas small, built of logs, and two berths on one side. The under one\r\nwas occupied by Pratt and wife, the upper one by Frink and me, and\r\nBlood slept on the floor. The next day we lunched at the second house\r\nfrom Milwaukee, at Pewaukee Lake, kept by Harrison Reed,[104]\r\nafterwards governor of Florida. We reached Oconomowoc that night,\r\nwhere we found two bachelors in a log shanty with a floor of bark and\r\nnothing to eat but dry beans, which they stewed for us and which we\r\nate with a relish from a bark plate with a chip for a knife. The\r\nmosquitoes were very large and hungry and feasted upon us that night.\r\nWe slept but little and left early in the morning on our Indian trail\r\nfor Rock River, having learned that there was a camp there where we\r\ncould get food. My feet had become very sore, and the morning’s walk\r\nof twelve miles in the rain without food, and almost gored to death by\r\nthe mosquitoes, had so exhausted me that I was sick and could go no\r\nfarther. Fortunately, at the river I found Charles Goodhue, Esq., and\r\ntwo of his sons from Sherbrooke, Lower Canada, an old acquaintance in\r\nthe East, who had a fine camp and ten or twelve men and three women in\r\ncamp. They bade me welcome and gave me to eat and to drink--the best\r\nthey had and I was never happier than that day. I was soon refreshed\r\nand ready to travel again. Mr. Goodhue and sons had commenced building\r\na dam across Rock River, and afterwards a saw mill was built to cut\r\nbasswood lumber to raft down the river where new settlements were\r\nbeing made.\r\n\r\nI remained with Mr. Goodhue and sons a few days and was persuaded by\r\nthem to visit what was then called New Albany (now Beloit) before\r\ngoing to Galena, they representing it as a very desirable point for a\r\ntown and offering me an interest in claims which they had recently\r\npurchased there. I accepted the proposition to visit Beloit. There was\r\na large encampment of Indians on the opposite side of Rock River from\r\nour camp, of whom we purchased a large canoe, giving them $5 and a\r\ngallon of whisky. In it Mr. Goodhue and son George, Mr. Blood, Mr.\r\nFrink, and myself embarked for Beloit. Goodhue and I owned the canoe\r\nand Frink and Blood worked their passage. The river was very high and\r\nwe went to Fort Atkinson the first half day and lodged that night with\r\nAlvin Foster in a log house, the only house there.[105] It had but one\r\nroom of moderate size in which were domiciled that night Foster and\r\nhis wife, mother, and niece, and seven travelers. The next day we\r\nreached Koshkonong Lake before 10 A. M., and the wind being high we\r\ndivided, Messrs. Goodhue, Frink, and Blood going by land around the\r\nlake, while George Goodhue and I kept the boat, preferring our chances\r\nto drown to the tramp by land of six miles on a hot day over a marsh\r\nof some miles. We were to meet at the outlet of the lake. We in the\r\nboat had a rough voyage, bailing water part of the way to prevent\r\nfoundering, and on our arrival at the outlet found none of our party\r\nand after waiting some hours we went on and just after dark we met\r\nthem on the river bank about ten miles below the lake, muddy and\r\ntired. We took them [in] and soon reached Janesville, a village of\r\nthree families, viz., Messrs. Bailey, Stevens, and Janes.[106] We\r\nremained there over night and next morning by 10 A. M. reached Beloit,\r\nwhere there was one family.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday morning, the fifteenth of July, 1837. I found Caleb\r\nBlodgett[107] and family there in a log house and we slept upon the\r\nfloor two nights while there, in the only house except a log hut which\r\nhad just been vacated by an Indian trader, by name Thibault, whose\r\nwife was a squaw. The first day, Sunday, I took a walk up where the\r\nCollege now stands and on to the banks of Turtle Creek where I saw\r\nmany Indian mounds, some of them still preserved and where I had an\r\nuninterrupted view of prairie such as I had never had before. I said\r\nto my friend with me that it was the most beautiful landscape view\r\nthat I had ever seen. Quite a number of Indian wigwams were standing\r\nupon the prairie near the creek and hurdles for drying their corn,\r\nwhich had been raised for years upon the Turtle bottoms.\r\n\r\nBeloit had been named by Blodgett “New Albany.” He with a large family\r\nof sons had located there in 1836 and built their house that fall and\r\nhad claimed some three miles square by ploughing a furrow around and\r\nputting up several shanties. The Government was surveying the land;\r\nand as it was not in the market, no title could be obtained except a\r\nso-called squatter’s title, which was obtained by a settlement upon\r\nthe land and which gave the settler the right to preëmpt 160 acres\r\nwhen it came into market. In February, 1837, Dr. Horace White visited\r\nBeloit as the agent of a New England company from Colebrook, New\r\nHampshire, that had sent him out to select a home for them in the new\r\nWest. He left Colebrook in January in company with R. P. Crane and O.\r\nP. Bicknell, who stopped in Michigan while White continued west\r\nexploring the Rock River valley and the valley of the Des Moines\r\nRiver, all then in the territory of Wisconsin. At Beloit he found\r\nBlodgett and sons (six of them) and John Hackett, a son-in-law, and\r\nbeing pleased with the place, he purchased one-third of all the\r\ninterest or claims of Blodgett and sons, the interests being\r\nundivided. Blodgett had before bought Thibault’s interest for $500,\r\nwho with his squaw removed to Koshkonong Lake, where I saw them both\r\non my first voyage down the river and on a subsequent one in\r\nSeptember. The following winter he was murdered by his squaw and her\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe following are the names of the colony for whom White acted: Horace\r\nWhite, Otis Bicknell, George W. and Charles Bicknell, their father,\r\nCaptain Bicknell, R. P. Crane, Messrs. Beach, Eames, and Alfred Field,\r\nand Israel Cheney, and one other whose name I forget, but who never\r\ncame west.[108] In March, White returned east and O. P. Bicknell and\r\nCrane came to Beloit and built a shanty and occupied it. That spring a\r\nMajor Johnson from Newburg, Vermont, and John Doolittle from Holley,\r\nLower Canada, had reached Beloit and purchased 2/12ths of Blodgett’s\r\nclaims and lived in the Thibault shanty. Charles Goodhue from\r\nSherbrooke, Lower Canada, and his brother-in-law, Tyler H. Moore, had\r\npurchased 3/12ths before and had begun the race and a saw mill on\r\nTurtle Creek when I reached the place. The interests were as follows\r\nthen: Blodgett and sons 3/12ths, New England Company (so-called)\r\n4/12ths, Goodhue and Moore 3/12ths, Johnson & Doolittle 2/12ths. I\r\nfound there Blodgett and sons, Johnson & Doolittle, Cyrus Eames,\r\nBicknell & Crane. The lower bench of Beloit or between the bluff and\r\nriver was still covered by heavy timber and underbrush, but little\r\nhaving been removed. The owners had broken some acres on the bottoms\r\nand were breaking 160 acres where Slaymaker now resides and 100 acres\r\non the high ground south of him. On Monday after my arrival I\r\npurchased of Goodhue and Moore one-fourth of their interest for $400\r\nand I paid for my share of the ploughing which was to be cultivated in\r\ncommon until a division of claims was made. I did not expect to locate\r\nthere but bought on speculation.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the seventeenth, I embarked in our canoe with Mr. Goodhue\r\nand son George, Mr. Frink, and Mr. Eames for Rockford, leaving Mr.\r\nBlood there. We remained at Rockford over night at the log hotel of\r\nMr. Miller. There were several families there. Mr. Goodhue’s son\r\nCharles met us there with his team and took us to Belvedere where he\r\nhad a little store and where half a dozen families had settled. It was\r\ncalled Squaw Prairie and a Mr. Doty kept a hotel or tavern. We left\r\nour canoe to the citizens of Rockford. After a night’s rest at\r\nBelvidere, Frink, Eames, and I started on foot for Chicago, stopping\r\nthe first night at Spencer’s Grove. The next day I was quite sick and\r\nreached Tyler & Raustead’s house, four miles west of Elgin, about six\r\nP. M., and was so sick that I felt that I could go no farther and\r\nproposed to stay over night, but they would not keep me, fearing that\r\nI should be too sick to leave in the morning. They reluctantly gave me\r\na cup of tea and I moved on, being virtually dragged by the arms the\r\nfour miles by Messrs. Frink and Doolittle.\r\n\r\nHere let me correct a mistake in dates and facts. Cyrus Eames was not\r\nat Beloit at this time, and it was not Eames who left Beloit in the\r\nboat with us, but John Doolittle, who returned to Canada with Mr.\r\nGoodhue at this time. We reached Elgin after dark, where I learned\r\nthat I had an aunt and her husband and three children living four\r\nmiles above Elgin on Fox River, and in the morning I parted with\r\nFrink, who started for Ottawa, and I hired Mr. Kimball, the landlord,\r\nto take me in a wagon to my Aunt Tyler’s, I being yet a sick man.\r\nElgin had about ten families. I found my aunt and husband with three\r\nsons on a farm of 400 acres which George Tyler had squatted upon in\r\n1835 and before the government survey. Aunt Tyler was the youngest\r\nsister of my mother, and married Noah Tyler of Claremont, New\r\nHampshire, about 1803 and by him had eight children, four sons and\r\nfour daughters. The family became Catholics and the four daughters\r\nbecame abbesses or superiors. The oldest son, George, went in early\r\nlife to Georgia and emigrated from the South to this state and sent\r\nfor his father, mother, and two brothers, who came to him. He married\r\nhere at the age of fifty and is now a resident of Texas. The second\r\nson, William, died Catholic bishop of Rhode Island and Connecticut, in\r\n1854, I think. The third son died at Dundee and the youngest is living\r\nat Elgin and has a large family of nine children. His name is Calvin.\r\nHe was educated for the Catholic priesthood. One daughter, Sallie, is\r\nliving in Detroit at the head of a Catholic nunnery.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LUCIUS GEORGE FISHER\r\n  From a daguerreotype in the possession of the Fisher family]\r\n\r\nMy good aunt nursed me well and in three days I was quite well and was\r\nsent for by Mr. Goodhue to meet him at Elgin, which I did and he took\r\nme to Chicago with his team. For miles before we reached Chicago the\r\nprairie was on an average one foot under water. I remained but a day\r\nor two in Chicago, stopping at the Tremont House. I took an old\r\nsteamer back to Milwaukee. I boarded at the Leland House on the west\r\nside until September, when I started again for Beloit by way of\r\nWatertown and was accompanied by a young man by the name of Sanborn,\r\nwho was or had been a medical student but had come west to seek his\r\nfortune. (He afterwards returned to New England and finished his\r\nstudies and became very eminent in his profession in Keene, New\r\nHampshire.) We borrowed a horse or pony of Colonel Parks, receiver of\r\nthe land office, and rode and tied to Watertown, and there we\r\nspanseled the pony and turned him out to grass. The next day the\r\nIndians had stolen him and he was found some weeks after at Green Bay.\r\nWe stopped with a Mr. Johnson, the first settler there and then the\r\nonly family there except one in Goodhue’s camp.[109] They gave us a\r\nbed separated from the bed of Mrs. Johnson and her daughter by a\r\nblanket hung between us. Mr. Johnson slept on the floor. The house was\r\nabout 12 × 12 feet, in one room. We had for food salt pork, potatoes,\r\nand blackberries, and good appetites.\r\n\r\nWe remained one week and labored diligently with adz and axe in\r\ncutting down a basswood tree and fashioning a canoe from it, and at\r\nthe end of a week we hired Mr. Johnson’s yoke of oxen and drew the\r\ncanoe about a mile to the river. Neither of us were acquainted with\r\nthe use of tools, and the canoe was not artistic. We launched it, and\r\non entering it the first time it shot from under me and left me in the\r\nriver. But we soon got the hang of it and we set sail. On entering\r\nLake Koshkonong we found the wild rice so high and thick that we could\r\nnot find a way out of it, and we returned to an Indian encampment on\r\nthe river and hired two Indian boys to go before us and pilot us\r\nthrough the rice (about half a mile) to clear water. We reached the\r\noutlet about dark and it was then by the river about twenty miles to\r\nJanesville, and we knew there was a log hut with a man and wife in it\r\nsomewhere before reaching Janesville.\r\n\r\nWe pulled on in a bright moonlight and reached the shanty about\r\nmidnight, very tired and hungry. On landing we went to the house and\r\nfound an opening with a quilt for a door, which I pushed aside and\r\nspoke to a woman whom I discovered in a bed with her head within a\r\nfoot of the door. She answered with a scream and the husband enquired,\r\n“Who is there?” I replied, “A friend,” and made known our wants. He\r\narose and struck a light and I found we were in a log room about 12 ×\r\n8 feet with no windows, door, or fireplace, the fire for cooking being\r\nmade against the logs at one end and a hole in the roof for the escape\r\nof the smoke. The bedstead was made of two upright sticks with sticks,\r\none end entering holes bored in the logs, the other entering holes in\r\nthe standing pieces and slats on these supports. There were two berths\r\nof this kind, one over the other. We were given the upper one and\r\nslept until the party under us had breakfast ready. The man had been\r\nto the river and caught a fine catfish for breakfast and we had\r\nappetites that gave our food a fine relish. From there we went to\r\nBeloit in one day without accident. This was in September. Mr. Sanborn\r\nremained with me several days. He boarded with Mr. Blodgett in his log\r\nhouse, sleeping on the floor. Mr. Johnson, Alfred Field, and some\r\nothers lived in the Thibault hut and the Bicknell family in a log hut\r\nnear the paper mill or present dam, on the east side of the river. I\r\nremained about four weeks.\r\n\r\nWhile there, a meeting of the settlers was called at the Beloit House,\r\nwhich was at that time enclosed and partly finished, to give a better\r\nname to the place. Major Johnson, Deacon Hobart, and myself were\r\nappointed a committee to report one and we proposed several and\r\nfinally agreed to place the alphabet in a hat and see if we could not\r\nget a combination of letters that would give us a name that would be a\r\nnew one. While proposing this, Mr. Johnson undertook to sound a French\r\nword for handsome ground and in trying he spoke “Bollotte,” and I said\r\nafter him “Beloit,” like Detroit in sound and pretty and original I\r\nthink. All sounded it and liked it and we reported it to the twenty or\r\nthirty who had sent us out and it was unanimously adopted; and it has\r\never since been Beloit and not New Albany.\r\n\r\nWhile at Beloit Major Johnson and Cyrus Eames took the canoe that\r\nSanborn and I made and floated down to Burlington where the first\r\nterritorial legislature for the Wisconsin Territory was in session.\r\nThe present states of Iowa and Wisconsin were called Wisconsin\r\nTerritory then. At that session they obtained a charter for a female\r\nseminary in Beloit, it being the first charter for an institution of\r\nlearning that was granted in the Territory.[110] While at Beloit in\r\nSeptember, a Professor Whitney of Belvidere preached the first sermon\r\nin the Beloit House that was preached in the county of Rock. I\r\nremained into October and then returned to Milwaukee by the way of\r\nWatertown on horseback, riding one of George Goodhue’s horses in\r\ncompany with him and remaining over night in his shanty at Watertown.\r\nI remained in Milwaukee until February, 1838, having sprained my ankle\r\nin January, which confined me to crutches for three months.\r\n\r\nMy father and sisters, Jane and Amanda, reached Fox River in December,\r\nwhere my sisters remained with my Aunt Tyler until March. They left\r\nVermont in October and came by land with a three-horse team. My father\r\ncame on to Beloit, and learning there that I was confined in Milwaukee\r\nby lameness, he started for me with his team, expecting to find his\r\ngoods shipped by water from Burlington, Vermont, but found that the\r\nvessel and goods had been sent near Mackinaw and that a friend of mine\r\nhad started with me in a jumper for Beloit, where we met after three\r\ndays. We rented one-half of the log house which Blodgett had just left\r\nto occupy a new frame house. We went to Dundee for my sisters in March\r\nand settled in our home with but little furniture. My father had\r\nbrought with him two beds and bedding and clothing. Dr. White, father\r\nof Horace White of New York, occupied the other half of the house with\r\nhis family. I met him in April and we soon became fast friends. He was\r\na good physician and a man of great business capacity, one who had\r\ngreat command of language and would say more in the fewest words than\r\nany man that I have ever known. He was a man of sound judgment. He was\r\na very [word illegible] and reserved man, making but few confidants.\r\nWe were more intimate than brothers usually are. We had no secrets\r\nthat were withheld by either from the other. He died in December,\r\n1843, and I was left very sad.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1838 I bought four yoke of oxen and broke prairie for\r\nthe crop of 1839 after seeding the 20 acres which was my share of the\r\n320 acres, which was ploughed in two fields and paid for and owned in\r\ncommon by the colonists. My father and I harrowed in wheat and oats in\r\nMarch. Bread and meat were very scarce and dear, and some days we had\r\nnothing but suckers caught out of Turtle Creek. But most of the time\r\nwe had meat and as soon as the vegetables grew we lived very well\r\nhaving plenty of hog product and bread. Our fall crop of wheat was\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1838 I went to Milwaukee and arranged with a merchant\r\nfor stoves, boots, and shoes to sell on commission, and with one team\r\nI drove them to Beloit and sold them at a good profit to the settlers\r\nwho were coming in almost every day. In the winter of 1838-9 we lived\r\nin a part of Mr. Blodgett’s new frame house. In the summer of 1838 I\r\nmade a claim of 160 acres on Rock River, two miles above Fort\r\nAtkinson, which was covered with timber, much of it basswood. In the\r\nwinter of 1838-9 I hired four men to cut logs and rafted them in the\r\nspring to Beloit and had them cut on shares by Messrs. Goodhue and\r\nMoore. From the sales of this lumber I paid my men and from a part of\r\nit I built a comfortable house for my family. My sisters, Emeline and\r\nRosetta, had been left behind, one in Montreal and Rosetta with an\r\nuncle in Burke, Vermont, under the care of a physician, having a\r\nsprained foot that she did not step upon for three years and which is\r\nnot well yet. They came west in the fall of 1838, so in the new house\r\nwe all gathered and were very happy.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1839, the first land sale took place in Milwaukee, and I was\r\nchosen bidder for all claimants in the south half of Rock County east\r\nof Rock River, the lands on the west side having been brought into\r\nmarket before at a land sale in Milwaukee. The claimants all secured\r\ntheir lands, they standing by me and permitting no one to bid but me\r\non their lands, and I got all for them at the upset price of $1.25 per\r\nacre. Here I met the cousin and agent of Gen. Philip Kearney, and\r\narranged with him to buy lands for the general and take the agency of\r\nthe lands purchased. I made entries for him at Milwaukee and\r\nafterwards at Dixon land sale and subsequently entered some thousands\r\nof acres with Mexican soldiers’ land warrants on shares and managed\r\nhis estate in the west for some years, and in 1856 I bought his\r\nremaining lands at $60,000 and closed my account with him. He visited\r\nme once in Beloit.\r\n\r\nThe first session of the territorial legislature was held at Belmont,\r\nLafayette County, the second at Burlington, Iowa, and the third in\r\nMadison in November, 1838, after Iowa was organized as a separate\r\nterritory. I attended that and succeeding sessions for several years\r\nas a lobby member. In 1839 I was appointed sheriff of Rock County by\r\nGovernor Dodge and held the office six years, in one of which I took\r\nthe census of the county and as sheriff collected the taxes of the\r\ncounty. I had my appointment from Governor Dodge two years, from\r\nGovernor Doty three years, and the last year from the people, the\r\noffice having been made elective. The statutes would not permit me to\r\nhold it again until after two years. My business was such that I could\r\nnot afford to hold it longer, and I accepted the last election because\r\nthe county was democratic and I was the only Whig that could defeat\r\nthe nominee of that party. On the night of the election I went to\r\nJanesville to get the returns and found all but four towns reported\r\nand a tie. The next town came in a tie, also the next, and one more to\r\nbe heard from and that a democratic one I knew. When I got the returns\r\nfrom that I had seven majority, and a great shout went up from my\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nAt the legislative session of 1840 I was appointed a commissioner to\r\nlay out three territorial roads--one from Beloit to Southport (now\r\nKenosha), one from Beloit to Madison, the other to Milwaukee. Two\r\nothers were appointed with me on each road. I spent much time on them\r\nand they are the roads of today with some slight changes. At the next\r\nsession I was commissioned to lay a road from Beloit to Watertown.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 I met for the first time Miss Caroline Field, the daughter of\r\nDeacon Peter Field, who was at Beloit to visit her parents. We soon\r\nbecame engaged to marry and after a courtship of three years we\r\nmarried in June, 1842. I had built a house, into which we moved on the\r\nday of our marriage, where I lived until 1866 and where all my\r\nchildren were born.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Horace White, Harvey Bundy, and myself formed a partnership in\r\na general goods business and commenced building the stone flour mill\r\non the Turtle Creek. We bought a stock of goods for another store,\r\ncalled the Mill Store. In December, 1843, Doctor White died and I was\r\nleft with all the business and also his family to care for and his\r\nestate to settle, and my partner, Harvey Bundy, a worthless business\r\nman. All the wise ones prophesied that we should fail and White’s\r\nestate was or would be used up. We owed a large amount and the mill\r\nwas about half finished. I felt that I might lose all--for I had not\r\nmuch to lose really beyond the land that I first purchased and a few\r\nhundred dollars earned. I settled the estate and saved it without\r\nloss, and kept the family together until Mrs. White married Deacon\r\nSamuel Hinman. Horace White of the _Tribune_ once, and now the\r\ntreasurer of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, was the son of\r\nDoctor White.[111]\r\n\r\nIn 1852 a railroad charter had been obtained for building a road from\r\nRacine to Beloit. Also, one from Southport to Beloit. The\r\nincorporators of each road came to me to assist them to build, and I\r\nchose the road to Racine and made enemies of the incorporators of the\r\nSouthport road for the time being. It was through my influence that it\r\nwas built. Fisher, Keep & Tolcott contracted to build it from Fox\r\nRiver to Freeport, and built it from Fox River or Burlington to\r\nDurand, when the financial crisis of 1867 failed the company and the\r\nwork was suspended one year. I was appointed a receiver by the court\r\nand ran it a short time when it was restored to the directors and I\r\nbecame a director and the company built it to the Mississippi and sold\r\nit out to the bondholders.\r\n\r\nBefore this, in 1848 the Chicago and Galena Railroad had been built to\r\nElgin and the funds of the company were exhausted, and William B.\r\nOgden and other directors came to Beloit and offered to build a branch\r\nof their road from Rockford to Beloit, when their road reached\r\nRockford, if the people of Beloit would subscribe $75,000 to the main\r\nline. I was selected by our citizens to take the subscription and in\r\none week I got it--part of it without conditions, and part with my\r\nguarantee that if they would subscribe and pay five per cent, that I\r\nwould guarantee the stock to be par when the second installment was\r\ncalled for. The installments were to be five per cent each month. Mr.\r\nKeep, Mr. Cheney, and myself took $30,000 and I took $15,000 for\r\nGeneral Kearney. When the second installment was called for I had to\r\ntake several thousand more that was given me on my agreement to take\r\nit if not at par. Before the third installment was due the stock was\r\nat five per cent premium and I sold most of it. The company built the\r\nroad from Belvidere instead of Rockford, which gave us a shorter line.\r\nThe next year the Beloit and Madison Railroad was begun, and I was\r\nelected a director in that and remained on the board until it was sold\r\nto the Chicago & Galena Company, which company soon after sold out to\r\nthe Northwestern Railroad Company. I was a contractor on the Chicago &\r\nNorthwestern Air Line between the Rock and Mississippi rivers. In 1856\r\nI was one of the contractors for building the railroad from Clinton,\r\nIowa, to Council Bluffs. The contract was for grading, ironing, and\r\nballasting the road and amounted to about $13,000,000. The pay was a\r\nland grant of every other section ten miles in width, some cash, and\r\nsome bonds and some stock. When we had expended about $400,000 in\r\ngrading, the company failed in 1857. We got the first 100 sections of\r\nland and the franchise of the road, which we sold to Mr. Blair of New\r\nJersey and got even with the company. We took the land grant and built\r\nthe road some years after; Morris K. Jessup, Dean Richmond, Charles\r\nReed of Erie, and Messrs. Morris & Courtright of New York were\r\npartners, also H. S. Durand and Wm. Allen of Racine. I also had a\r\npartnership with the last two and Judge Green of Providence, Rhode\r\nIsland, by which the latter gentleman was to furnish $100,000 cash to\r\nbe used by Durand, Allan, and myself in the purchase of lands and town\r\nsites in Iowa on the line of the road, the profits to be divided\r\nequally between Durand, Allan, and myself, party of the first part,\r\nand Greene and his associates, party of the second part. The crisis of\r\n1857 ended that project. In 1852 I prevailed upon a party in\r\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to open a bank in Beloit. In 1854 John M.\r\nKeep, A. L. Field, and myself bought the bank stock and elected Keep\r\npresident and Field cashier. In 1856 I was elected president and Mr.\r\nKeep sold his stock. In the crisis of 1857 the bank failed and was\r\nclosed and its charter sold to Davis & Martin. In 1856 I was elected\r\nto the legislature and served in 1856-7 and declined a reëlection, as\r\nat the time of election the next year, I had more business irons in\r\nthe fire than I could attend to.\r\n\r\nWhen the charter of the city of Beloit was obtained, I was elected an\r\nalderman from the second ward and served six years, and was two years\r\ncounty supervisor. I was a director in a gas company, also in a car\r\ncompany that went no further than organizing.\r\n\r\nI was a partner of W. T. Goodhue in the purchase and ownership of\r\nconsiderable real estate. With Goodhue and R. H. Mills in the purchase\r\nand sale of real estate; also, with R. H. Mills in the purchase and\r\nsale of a large amount of real estate. In the settlement with Mr.\r\nMills, he owed me over $15,000 which he could not pay, so I gave it to\r\nhim. Mr. H. Cheney owed me as much more when he left for Colorado,\r\nwhere he died. Messrs. Mills, Brooks, and I purchased and sold much\r\nreal estate. I was elected a trustee of Beloit College at its\r\norganization and have been to date, also one of the Executive\r\nCommittee while I lived in Beloit, and gave much of the site or\r\ngrounds. I have been a deacon in the Congregational church about\r\nthirty years. In 1861 I was appointed by President Lincoln postmaster\r\nat Beloit. He had been my attorney in defending the title to Beloit,\r\nwhich I did at my own expense mostly and won the suit, and saved the\r\ncitizens from a heavy blackmail.\r\n\r\nThe president offered me any office that I thought myself competent to\r\nfill, through my friend, David Davis. I took the Beloit post office,\r\nas I could not leave my business interests in Beloit. At the end of\r\nfour years I was commissioned again by Lincoln and was afterwards\r\nremoved by Johnson for refusing to support his measures. In 1862 I was\r\nappointed by Secretary Chase to take subscriptions to the first or\r\ngold bonds issued to carry on the war, and was one of two appointed\r\nfor Wisconsin and received subscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [97] Lucius G. Fisher, a native of Vermont, was born at\r\n     Derby, August 17, 1808. His father was a substantial farmer\r\n     of Derby, but due to business reverses the son failed to\r\n     obtain the anticipated college education, a fact which he\r\n     never ceased to lament. While still a youth he formed the\r\n     design of migrating to the West, but the execution of this\r\n     project was delayed for several years, first by reason of\r\n     his disinclination to separate from his mother, and after\r\n     her death by the necessity of assisting in the support of\r\n     his father and sisters. After several years of school\r\n     teaching and two years of service as sheriff’s deputy,\r\n     Fisher in 1834 entered the employ of the Messrs. Fairbanks,\r\n     of St. Johnsbury, Vermont, to travel for them and introduce\r\n     their “recently invented” platform scales. The immediate\r\n     inducement to this employment was the proffered salary of\r\n     $500 yearly and all expenses; but the work was accepted by\r\n     Fisher, as he reports in later life, in order to find, in\r\n     his travels, “that better country” he had determined, when\r\n     but sixteen years of age, to seek.\r\n\r\n     The employment with the Fairbanks company continued\r\n     profitably for Fisher for three years. Then the panic of\r\n     1837 brought it to a disastrous termination, under the\r\n     circumstances set forth in the narrative which follows. The\r\n     manuscript from which these facts are drawn, and the greater\r\n     portion of which we print, tells the story of the writer’s\r\n     life from birth until the time of writing, at Chicago, in\r\n     the spring of 1883. To summarize its concluding portion,\r\n     Fisher left Beloit for Chicago in 1866, where with Ralph\r\n     Emerson he built a block at the southeast corner of State\r\n     and Washington streets on the site of the present Columbus\r\n     Memorial Building. Although burned out in the great fire of\r\n     October 9, 1871, Fisher prospered in Chicago and became\r\n     comparatively wealthy.\r\n\r\n     The manuscript narrative of his career was presented to the\r\n     State Historical Society of Wisconsin in January, 1917 by a\r\n     grandson, William Scott Bond, of Chicago. Because of the\r\n     valuable picture it presents of pioneer days in Wisconsin,\r\n     and particularly of the early development of Beloit, in\r\n     which Mr. Fisher played a prominent and creditable part, the\r\n     narrative seems eminently worthy of the wider publicity and\r\n     service which its publication in the Wisconsin Magazine of\r\n     History involves. In preparing the manuscript for\r\n     publication a uniform typographical style has been imposed,\r\n     and certain minor lapses in composition have been\r\n     eliminated; but these editorial changes affect in no degree\r\n     the character of the narrative as it left Mr. Fisher’s hand.\r\n\r\n     [98] The _Democrat_, the first newspaper published in\r\n     Chicago, was founded by John Calhoun in November, 1833. In\r\n     1836 Calhoun sold the paper to John Wentworth, who continued\r\n     as its proprietor and editor until the _Democrat_ was merged\r\n     with the _Tribune_ in 1861.\r\n\r\n     [99] Gurdon S. Hubbard, a native of Vermont, came west in\r\n     1818 as a youth in the employ of the American Fur Company,\r\n     and was assigned to the Illinois Brigade. A number of years\r\n     later he made Chicago his permanent residence and became one\r\n     of the most prominent of the first generation of Chicago\r\n     business men. He does not, however, deserve in any sense the\r\n     title of “first settler” of Chicago.\r\n\r\n     [100] Chase’s Point was named after Horace Chase, a\r\n     prominent citizen of early Milwaukee. Like the Chicago\r\n     River, the Milwaukee has been subjected to a civilizing\r\n     process which has resulted in the acquisition of a new mouth\r\n     some distance to the north of the natural one.\r\n\r\n     [101] John H. Tweedy, a native of Connecticut and graduate\r\n     of Yale, came to Milwaukee in 1836 as a youthful lawyer of\r\n     twenty-two. He soon became prominent both in legal and in\r\n     political circles, and throughout the territorial period was\r\n     one of the leaders of the Whig faction in Wisconsin. In 1847\r\n     he was elected as territorial delegate to Congress. Upon the\r\n     admission of Wisconsin to statehood Tweedy was put forward\r\n     by the Whigs as their candidate for the governorship, but\r\n     was defeated by Nelson Dewey. During the fifties Tweedy was\r\n     active in the development of the railroad system of\r\n     Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n     [102] Apparently the reference is to Solomon Juneau, one of\r\n     the founders of Milwaukee, who settled there as an Indian\r\n     trader in 1818.\r\n\r\n     [103] Alexander Pratt had removed from Milwaukee to Waukesha\r\n     earlier in the year 1837. Although one of the very early\r\n     settlers of Waukesha, he was not the first one, nor was his\r\n     house the only one at the place at the time of Fisher’s\r\n     visit. Pratt was unmarried at this time. He was a man of\r\n     some means, however, and had in his employ a man and wife.\r\n     Probably this couple is the one alluded to by Fisher.\r\n\r\n     [104] Harrison Reed had come west to Milwaukee in 1836, and\r\n     in 1837 became virtually the first editor of the _Sentinel_.\r\n     By an unfortunate quarrel a few years later he lost control\r\n     of the paper and was ruined financially. After residences at\r\n     Madison and Menasha, Reed in 1862 was appointed tax\r\n     commissioner of Florida. He later (1868-72) served as\r\n     governor of the state.\r\n\r\n     [105] The settlement of Fort Atkinson was begun in the\r\n     autumn of 1836 under the auspices of the Rock River Claim\r\n     Company. This company, organized earlier in the same year,\r\n     had sent out an exploring party and made claims at several\r\n     points, including Fort Atkinson. In order to make good the\r\n     latter claim it was decided to locate a family on it, and\r\n     accordingly a house was built and occupied by Dwight Foster\r\n     and family, late in 1836. During the ensuing winter, Edward\r\n     and Alvin Foster also came to Fort Atkinson, their houses\r\n     being built about a mile up the river from Dwight Foster’s\r\n     cabin. Instead of being the first house at this point,\r\n     therefore, Alvin Foster’s was the second or third one built.\r\n\r\n     [106] The settlement of Janesville was begun by the erection\r\n     of a log house by John Inman and others near the close of\r\n     the year 1835. Two or three months later Henry Janes, for\r\n     whom the town is named, staked out a claim here, and in the\r\n     spring of 1836 brought his family to a cabin which workmen\r\n     had already built for him. Several other families came\r\n     during the following months, and Fisher is probably\r\n     incorrect in saying there were but three at the time of his\r\n     first visit in the autumn of 1837. The Bailey family,\r\n     mentioned by Fisher, arrived in the autumn of 1836, and the\r\n     Stevens family in the spring of 1837.\r\n\r\n     [107] Blodgett, a native of Vermont, had come west in search\r\n     of a fortune, and in the spring of 1836 had bought\r\n     Thibault’s squatter-right claim to all the land within\r\n     “three looks” of his cabin for $200. Blodgett thereupon set\r\n     up a claim to some ten sections of land, and fortified it,\r\n     according to local histories, by building a log house and\r\n     ploughing a furrow around it. Before becoming possessed of\r\n     any legal title whatever, Blodgett began disposing of his\r\n     extensive domain by selling to Goodhue his claim to\r\n     one-third of it (one-fourth, according to Fisher) for the\r\n     sum of $2,000. Goodhue in turn disposed of one-fourth of his\r\n     interest to Fisher for $400. Meanwhile, in March, 1837, Dr.\r\n     Horace White of Colebrook, N. H., had visited the place, and\r\n     on behalf of the New England Emigrating Company had\r\n     purchased one-third of Blodgett’s claim for $2,500. This\r\n     coming of the New England Emigrating Company to Beloit may\r\n     be regarded as the most important event in connection with\r\n     its early development. At the same time Doctor White was\r\n     instrumental in giving to Beloit her most famous citizen in\r\n     the person of his three-year old son, Horace.\r\n\r\n     [108] The list of members according to Horace White included\r\n     the following persons: Cyrus Eames, O. P. Bicknell, John W.\r\n     Bicknell, Asahel B. Howe, Leonard Hatch, David J. Bundy, Ira\r\n     Young, L. C. Beech, S. G. Colley, G. W. Bicknell, R. P.\r\n     Crane, Horace Hobart, Horace White, and Alfred Field.\r\n     William F. Brown, _History of Rock County_ (Chicago, 1908),\r\n     I, 133.\r\n\r\n     [109] This was Timothy Johnson, a native of Middletown,\r\n     Conn., who came to Wisconsin in 1835. He stopped at Racine\r\n     for a few months, going from there to Wisconsin City (now\r\n     Janesville) at the beginning of 1836. Not satisfied here,\r\n     however, he soon went up Rock River to a point about two\r\n     miles below the site of Jefferson, where he built a log\r\n     house and cleared a garden plot. Further prospecting soon\r\n     led to the discovery of “Johnson’s Rapids” (modern\r\n     Watertown), where he staked out a claim of 1,000 acres in\r\n     the spring of 1836, bringing his family to the place in\r\n     December following. He had thus been settled here about a\r\n     year at the time of Fisher’s first visit.\r\n\r\n     [110] The charter was granted in 1837 for the establishment\r\n     of a seminary “for young persons of either sex.” The school\r\n     was not started, according to Horace White, until 1843 or\r\n     1844, when classes were held in the basement of the new\r\n     Congregational church. Classes for girls were maintained\r\n     separately in the “Female Seminary.”\r\n\r\n     [111] Horace White, widely known as a publicist, and writer\r\n     on financial themes, was brought to Beloit by his parents as\r\n     a child of three years in 1837. He was graduated at Beloit\r\n     College in 1853, and in 1854 became city editor of the\r\n     Chicago _Evening Journal_. From 1864 to 1874 he was editor\r\n     and part owner of the Chicago _Tribune_. In 1883 he bought a\r\n     part interest in the New York _Evening Post_ and thereafter\r\n     for twenty years was one of its managers, and for the last\r\n     few years of the period its editor-in-chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nTHE CHICAGO TREATY OF 1833\r\n\r\nWITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES BY MILO M. QUAIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Treaty of 1833, with the negotiating of which the\r\nfollowing documents deal, was an event of considerable importance,\r\nparticularly in the history of Illinois and Wisconsin. From the first\r\nadvent of the white man in this region the Potawatomi tribe of Indians\r\nhad made its home in some portion of the territory adjacent to Lake\r\nMichigan. By the Chicago Treaty of 1833 the Potawatomi and allied\r\ntribes, the Chippewa and Ottawa, at length agreed definitely to leave\r\nthis region and find a new home beyond the Mississippi. To the whites\r\nwas surrendered their title to some 5,000,000 acres of fertile land in\r\nnorthern Illinois and southern Wisconsin, embracing the tract between\r\nLake Michigan and Rock River and extending northward from an east and\r\nwest line drawn through the southernmost point of Lake Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances attending the negotiation of the treaty were\r\ntypical, probably, of those of Indian treaties generally in the first\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century. Yet two or three facts give to this\r\ntreaty a somewhat special degree of interest. One is that we have left\r\nto us fuller and better descriptions of the negotiation of the treaty\r\nthan is commonly the case. Another and more important one is that a\r\nlarger sum of money was distributed in the form of gratuities more or\r\nless disguised, to facilitate the conduct of the negotiations. It is\r\nwith this phase of the subject that the documents here presented deal.\r\nSo far as known, no student of American history has ever seriously set\r\nhimself the task of illuminating the subject of the process whereby\r\nthe American government secured from the red man, in successive\r\ntreaties, title to the greater portion of the land of continental\r\nUnited States.[112] A comprehensive study of this subject would reveal\r\nmuch of interest and value; it would be certain, too, to disclose much\r\nof a nature far from flattering to the American government and nation.\r\nThat the Chicago Treaty of 1833 would afford some material of this\r\nsort for the construction of the narrative, it requires no hardihood\r\nto affirm. Charges of improper influences and conduct in connection\r\nwith the framing of the treaty began to be made as soon as it was\r\nnegotiated. Some of them, doubtless, were irresponsible and unfounded,\r\nbut there is reason for supposing that this was far from being true\r\nwith respect to all of them. The letter of Governor Porter is\r\npreserved in the Burton Library at Detroit, and acknowledgment is due\r\nto Mr. Burton for the copy we present. The charges against Porter are\r\ncopied from a contemporary broadside preserved among the Martin\r\nmanuscripts in the Wisconsin Historical Library. The two documents go\r\nhand in hand, for it is evident that the charges which Porter sought\r\nin his letter to Jackson to refute are identical with those stated in\r\nthe broadside, although the latter seems not to contain all the\r\nmaterial which had been submitted to Jackson and which was referred by\r\nhim to Porter to answer. Readers who may be interested in pursuing the\r\nsubject further may find a discussion of the Chicago Treaty of 1833 in\r\nthe present editor’s _Chicago and the Old Northwest 1673-1835_, 353-66.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHARGES PREFERRED AGAINST GEORGE B.

The heirs of Forsyth and Kinzie, are cousins, consequently\r\nthe above claims are all in one family. Major Robert A. Forsyth, a\r\nPaymaster in the U. S. Army, and the individual above named, was one\r\nof the committee on claims who allowed the above sum of $42,516 to\r\nhimself, his sisters and cousins--one individual only being associated\r\nwith him. The Major, and all of his sisters, were born in the province\r\nof Upper Canada, and he to this day has never been naturalized. He is,\r\nhowever, the especial protege of the Secretary of War, and Governor\r\nPorter. A large amount of just claims were rejected by the Committee,\r\nto make room for the claims allowed above.\r\n\r\n  * Robert A.

Forsyth can control as he\r\npleases, received $10,000 each, as a bribe to induce them to influence\r\nthe other Chiefs of the Nation. It is allowed out of the $100,000\r\nappropriated in lieu of reservations. Caldwell was the principal Chief\r\nat the massacre of the River Raisin. A Frenchman called Loranger, an\r\nIndian trader, was allowed by the committee on claims $5000, by\r\nassigning his claim to Robert A. Forsyth, to whom he was indebted\r\n$3000. The goods _furnished by John H. Kinzie, Aid-de-Camp to Governor\r\nPorter, (and the individual named in the list of claims,) and Mr.\r\nKercheval, (the husband of Maria Kercheval, named in the list of\r\nclaims,)_ under former treaties, amounted to $100,000. The practice of\r\nGov. Cass has always been to give the furnishing of goods to be\r\ndistributed among the Indians, under a regulation of a former treaty,\r\nto the Indian Agent at the Agency where the goods were to be\r\ndistributed, as a perquisite of his office. Had the precedent been\r\nfollowed in the present case, the Indian Agents at Green Bay, Chicago\r\nand Logansport, would have had the distribution of the goods. But Gov.\r\nPorter assigned, _over and over again_, as a reason for taking this\r\nperquisite from the Agents, that he was desirous of saving the per\r\ncentage usually allowed them, and that in lieu of this per centage, he\r\nhad engaged Kinzie and Kercheval only as agents to purchase the goods\r\nin New-York, and was to give them a per diem allowance for this\r\ntrouble. Yet, in express contradiction of this declaration, Governor\r\nPorter, _as can be positively proved_, has allowed to Kinzie and\r\nKercheval, 50 per cent. on the whole amount of goods furnished, making\r\nto them a profit of $50,000.\r\n\r\n  Claims           $42,516\r\n  Trust Fund         3,200\r\n  Profit on Goods   50,000\r\n                    ------\r\n                   $95,716\r\n\r\nThis amount of public money is put into the pockets of one family in\r\nthe short space of six weeks. Is it not reasonable to suppose, that\r\nGovernor Porter finds a strong reason for confining the patronage of\r\nthe Government to one family, in the _fact that he comes in for a\r\nshare of the “plunder?”_\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, Kinzie and Kercheval have received from Governor\r\nPorter, the contract to furnish the Indians with horses, from which\r\nthey will undoubtedly realize $10,000.\r\n\r\nKinzie also obtained the exclusive furnishing of the goods at the\r\nforks of the Wabash, amounting to $40,000, and Kercheval at\r\nNottawassippie, to the amount of $20,000.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact notorious among all who attended the Chicago Treaty, that\r\nthe goods furnished at that treaty, were afterwards taken from the\r\nIndians in large amounts, and furnished at other places. Kinzie\r\nhimself, used the goods which he furnished the Indians as a _gag_ to\r\nthose who complained of his conduct, by making them presents of cloth,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nLucius Lyon, our Delegate in Congress, is in possession of all the\r\nforegoing facts, and will vouch for their correctness; and for their\r\nfurther confirmation, I refer you to Geo. W. Ewing, Logansport, Ind.;\r\nAlexis Coquillard, South Bend, Ind.; Thos. J. V. Owen, Indian Agent,\r\nChicago; Peter Godfroy, Teunis S. Wendell, Wm. Brewster, Edward\r\nBrooks, and S. T. Mason, of Detroit; and Robert Stewart, Mackinac; and\r\nCol. Ewing, Secretary of the Commissioners. Most respectfully\r\nsubmitted for your consideration.\r\n\r\n                        Your Obedient Servt.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM GEORGE B. PORTER TO PRESIDENT ANDREW JACKSON\r\n\r\n                              Detroit, December 15th, 1833.\r\n\r\n  Gen’l Andrew Jackson,\r\n  President of the United States,\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAfter a fatiguing tour of more than three months, in performance of\r\nthe several public duties assigned to me, I arrived here last evening,\r\nand have the honor to acknowledge the receipt, this morning, of your\r\nletter of the 2nd inst. with its inclosure.\r\n\r\nPersonal respect for you, Sir, restrains the expression of feelings,\r\noutraged and indignant at having been made the object of calumnies, so\r\nwantonly malicious and grossly untrue, as those contained in the paper\r\nlaid before you, a copy of which you have transmitted.\r\n\r\nI appreciate, with a proper sense of the obligation, the considerate\r\njustice which has offered me the means of confronting my accusers,\r\nwhenever they shall declare themselves; and I thank you for the\r\nrenewed mark of confidence in my integrity, thus indicated.\r\n\r\nThe statements contained in this tissue of fabrications, shall be met\r\nfully and fairly, by my own distinct declarations, which, if deemed\r\ninsufficient, shall be sustained by ample testimony, incapable of\r\nrefutation. And if in vindicating my honor from unmerited aspersion,\r\nthe detail should prove tedious, I ask, not doubting it will be\r\ngranted, your forbearance for a temper, smarting under a sense of\r\nundeserved injury.\r\n\r\nI may be permitted to premise, that like other public men, I too, have\r\nmy enemies. But for this peculiar and vindictive rancour that assails\r\nme, I cannot otherwise account, than by attributing it to that\r\nfruitful source of evil passions--disappointed expectations. If, in\r\nthe endeavor faithfully to discharge my duties, it has not been in my\r\npower to accomplish _all_ the wishes of _all_, it is but the common\r\nlesson which experience has taught, to others as well as to myself.\r\nThe invidious feeling which these causes produce, seeks to gratify\r\nitself, by wresting from me the credit of having effected an important\r\nTreaty, and would willingly sacrifice to its object the best interests\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nTo proceed then to the matters alleged against me.\r\n\r\nThe first proposition contains both an indirect and a direct\r\nfalsehood. First, in stating, for the purpose of disparagement, that\r\nbut three million acres of land are purchased, when in point of fact,\r\nthere are nearly six millions; And Secondly, that the title not being\r\nin the Indians, “_there was no necessity for a Treaty at all_.” The\r\ndeclaration itself is utterly without foundation; but waiving this, I\r\nremark, that the province of determining this “_necessity_,” rested\r\nnot with the Commissioners but with the President. In the present\r\ninstance, it is well known that a cession of country along the Western\r\nshore of Lake Michigan was deemed of so much importance, that an\r\nappropriation for holding the Treaty was made at the last Session of\r\nCongress--Who could be ignorant of this fact? And yet, those who\r\nprofess to understand this matter better than the President and\r\nCongress, and the Secretary of War, whose knowledge of these Indians\r\nand this region of country is minutely particular, assert that the\r\nland did not belong to the Indians ceding it, and that “_a little\r\ninvestigation will satisfy any reasonable man that there was no\r\nnecessity for a Treaty at all_.”\r\n\r\nIt is stated also that to indulge my favoritism its objects always\r\nfound it an easy matter to “persuade his Excellency to get up a\r\nTreaty.” The mendacity of the writer is equalled only by his\r\nignorance. The power which assumes the ordering of Treaties does not\r\nlie with me. But without this, the charge is unfortunate in its\r\napplication, for I appeal to my letters on file in the Department to\r\nshow whether this appointment was eagerly coveted, or reluctantly\r\naccepted, by me. And the instructions of the Department under which\r\nthe Commissioners acted, (an extract from which for your convenience I\r\nenclose), will show, that the Secretary was not only aware of the\r\nimportance of the duty but directed us “_not to abandon it till all\r\nhopes of success were exhausted_.” That we succeeded in effecting all\r\nthat was required of us and, in the opinion of every good and\r\nintelligent citizen with whom I have conversed, made a valuable\r\nTreaty, advantageous alike to the Government and the Indians, of\r\nimportance to the surrounding country, and this in the most public and\r\nhonorable manner, I had never heard doubted, until my return to this\r\nplace. Since then, I have heard of boasts that I should be destroyed.\r\nAnd accordingly, during my _absence_, falsehood and aspersion were\r\nbusy with my character and conduct. To destroy the confidence you\r\nrepose in me, no means have been scruppled at.--First, it is boldly\r\nproclaimed that I cannot effect a Treaty--then it is denied that any\r\ncredit is due to _me_, for having accomplished it:--and now, I am held\r\nexclusively answerable for the whole Treaty, and every circumstance\r\nattending it.\r\n\r\nTo my Co-Commissioners, and the gentleman selected _by them_ as the\r\nSecretary of the Commission, who are all highly respectable Citizens\r\nof Illinois:--to the full Journal of all our proceedings:--to the many\r\ndistinguished citizens of Illinois, Indiana and the surrounding\r\ncountry:--to every honourable man who was present during the Council,\r\namong whom are Mr. Daniel Jackson of New York--and Mr. Robert Stewart,\r\nthe Agent of the American Fur Company at Michilimackinac, both of whom\r\nI understand to be now in Washington, and whose characters are known\r\nto you, I appeal with confidence, for a refutation of these\r\nslanders.[113]\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that extra allowances have been made to me for extra\r\nservices is not disputed, being an usage of the Government from its\r\nfirst institution. The labors I have performed and the fatigues I have\r\nundergone, in this tour, over roads almost impassable, and during a\r\ncontinuation of the most unfavorable weather, teach me to believe that\r\nI have honestly earned all that the Rule of Department will allow: But\r\nthe vile and mean insinuation appended, and which none but an utterly\r\ncorrupt heart could generate, that I have _sold_ my patronage, does\r\nnot require an answer.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the claims or accounts contained in the Schedules\r\nannexed to the Treaty, to some of which particular exception has been\r\ntaken, I proceed, in explanation, to state: That in furtherance of the\r\npolicy of the Government to remove these Indians West of the\r\nMississippi, the Commissioners refused to grant Reservations of land,\r\nalthough these were greatly preferred, but agreed, in lieu thereof,\r\nthat a part of the _consideration money_ should be apportioned among\r\nsuch individuals as the Indians chose to designate. In like manner\r\nanother part of the consideration money, the _amount_ of which was\r\nfixed, was to be applied in satisfaction of claims, which, on\r\nexamination, should be admitted by the Indians to be justly divided.\r\nWho, so well as they, could tell whether they were indebted to an\r\nindividual or not? But to protect themselves against unfounded claims,\r\nmany of which were presented, the Chiefs and head men employed a\r\ngentleman of high standing and respectability, as their assistant, and\r\nasked permission that he might be present at the investigation of the\r\nclaims. This gentleman was Richard E. Hamilton, Esq.,[114] of\r\nChicago--in whom these Indians reposed unbounded confidence--They\r\nfarther requested that Major Forsyth, for whom they professed a like\r\nregard, and who was familiarly known to them, should aid their friend\r\nCol. Hamilton in the duty confided to him. Impressed, as all were,\r\nwith the character of the two gentlemen for integrity and honor, so\r\nreasonable a request was not denied.--In the presence of the Chiefs\r\nand those Assistants, the commissioners proceeded in the examination\r\nof the numerous claims, the _decision_ on each claim being made by the\r\ncommissioners; by all of them; and by them _alone_; and the amount\r\nallowed on each claim was then and there written down by the\r\nSecretary. So far as relates to the allowances, (so principal an\r\nobject of animadversion), granted to the heirs of Forsyth & Kinzie, I\r\naver, without fear of contradiction, that neither Major Forsyth nor\r\nany of the persons interested, had anything to do with the decision\r\nupon them; nor, to the best of my knowledge and recollection, were any\r\nof them present, when they were acted on--The Chiefs and Head men\r\ninsisted upon these allowances, and the Commissioners, on hearing the\r\nrepresentation of the Indians unanimously acquiesced in their justice.\r\nThese with the several other claims allowed form, as I have stated, a\r\npart of the consideration money of the Treaty, and if it were\r\npossible, which it certainly is not, to preserve the Treaty, striking\r\nthese out, the Individuals named would, I have not a doubt, suffer\r\nneither detriment nor loss--The whole Potawatamie Nation would, I am\r\npersuaded, restore the allowances at the Annuity table.\r\n\r\nThe name of Robert A. Forsyth, which occurs three times in the first\r\nstatement of allowances, belongs to two different individuals, one of\r\nwhom is a Merchant in Ohio,[115] and the other, the Paymaster. The\r\nextensive trade in which the Merchant of this name in Ohio is engaged\r\nwill appear on reference to several Treaties lately made in Ohio and\r\nIndiana. Nor is this confusion of names mentioned in defence or\r\nextenuation--I am ignorant of any just ground of exception to my\r\nconduct, in the whole history of this transaction, but I note it,\r\nmerely, as one of a series of deceptive statements. The jeering\r\ncomment follows that “Major Forsyth of the United States Army,\r\nreceived his $3000 as an Indian Chief.” These falsehoods are almost\r\ntoo gross for refutation. The Treaty states the allowance. Does it say\r\nhe received it as an Indian Chief? The Indians stated, themselves, and\r\nwithout any prompting on the part of the Commissioners, that there was\r\ndue to Robert A. Forsyth a reservation, which had long since been\r\npromised by their nation, and which they had desired Governor Cass and\r\nJudge Sibley, Commissioners at the Treaty of Chicago in 1821, to grant\r\nhim. This request has been reiterated at the Treaty of St. Joseph, in\r\n1828, as can be attested by Gov. Cass and Mr. Menard, the\r\nCommissioners;--the land being then, and ever since, set apart for him\r\nby the Indians. It was not secured to him in either of these Treaties,\r\nbecause not included within the bounds of the lands then ceded. The\r\nCommissioners, in this, as in every other instance when it could be\r\ndone compatibly with the policy of the Government, and with justice to\r\nIndividuals and the Indians, conceived it their duty to obey their\r\nwishes.[116] The selection of persons to examine and adjust claims, as\r\nwell for reservations as on account of losses, was made, not by the\r\nCommissioners, but by the Indians themselves. The claims were all\r\nsubjected to the supervision of the Indians, or persons they\r\nthemselves appointed to represent them;--It is notorious that they\r\nexpressed at all times the most unhesitating confidence in their\r\nIndian Agent, Col. Owen, who was one of the Commissioners:--in Col.\r\nHamilton, whom they specially deputed to act for them, and in the two\r\npersons scoffed at as “_half whites_,” Caldwell and Robinson.[117]\r\nWith these was associated also Joseph, an influential Chief, who was\r\npresent in every business transaction--Caldwell and Robinson have been\r\nnurtured with, and raised by, these Indians, one from childhood, and\r\nthe other from his birth; they are identified with this tribe, and are\r\nIndians in character, in manners, in mode of life, in sentiments and\r\nconduct, and as such are regarded by them. By reference to the Treaty\r\nof 1829, it will be seen that they were then acknowledged as the\r\nprincipal men, and the Treaty was made with them. Whom could they\r\ntrust if not these? After the assent to sell had been obtained, and\r\nthe general preliminaries had been agreed upon, the Indians in open\r\ncouncil, as will appear by the Journal, advised the Commissioners that\r\nthey had confided the care of their interests, and all the details of\r\nthe Treaty, to these, their principal chiefs; and the Commissioners,\r\nas I considered then and now, properly acquiesced. When these details\r\nwere completed, and the Treaty reduced to form, it was read by Col.\r\nHamilton in private Council to the Indians, and was again read before\r\nthem in public Council, by myself, and unanimously approved. It is\r\nrepresented that old Mr. Forsyth never had $500 in property in his\r\nlife. This can be disproved by a hundred witnesses, conversant with\r\nthe fact, that he was extensively engaged in the Indian trade. So,\r\ntoo, the assertion that “old Mr. Kinzie died a subject of the King of\r\nGreat Britain”, can be falsified by the records of the War Department,\r\nshowing him to have been for many years after the war a _Sub Agent of\r\nthe Government_. Equally and unqualifiedly false also is the\r\ndeclaration that “he fought against his country in the late war,” or\r\n“led the Indians in the Massacre of Chicago.” On the contrary he was a\r\nzealous and efficient partizan of the American party, and as the books\r\nof the American Fur Company will show, was their agent at his death.\r\n\r\nNor is the declaration that Major Robert A. Forsyth, a Paymaster in\r\nthe United States Army, has never been “naturalized,” by which it is\r\nintended to be conveyed that he is an alien, less destitute of truth.\r\nThe Father of Major Forsyth was an American Citizen, (born in\r\nDetroit), and has always resided in this country, and the accidental\r\ncircumstance that Major F’s mother was, at his birth, among her\r\nfriends across the narrow line which divided the Territory from\r\nCanada, did not, nor could, divest him of his national character. The\r\nlaw of nations recognize no such principle: Accordingly, the vote of\r\nMajor Forsyth has never been challenged at an election; he bore a\r\nCommission, as a Cadet of the Military Academy, and subsequently as an\r\nofficer in the Army of the United States. He has been elected to the\r\nLegislature of the Territory, and executed the trust; where the\r\nobjection stated, if valid, would have been fatal. Finally, he has\r\nreceived from the President of United States, a Commission as Pay\r\nMaster in the United States Army. Equally deceptive with every other\r\nfeature of this malignant attempt to destroy me, is the perverse\r\nmeaning significantly assigned to the trusts, confided to Major\r\nForsyth and Mr. Kinzie. They are real, substantial trusts, created\r\nunder circumstances of perfect notoreity at Chicago, and challenge\r\nscrutiny. In these, as in every other case, the appointment was made\r\nwithout consulting the individual, and in some instances against his\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\nMajor Forsyth is charged also with having bribed Caldwell and Robinson\r\nwith $10,000 each, to influence the Chiefs of their Nation. This\r\nvaries in nothing from the complexion of the other statements. It is a\r\npure fiction. Major Forsyth had nothing to do with the matter. The\r\nIndividuals cited, received, by the express direction of their people,\r\nthe sum of $10,000 each, _as the two head men of the nation_, to whom\r\nthe entire direction of their affairs had long before been\r\ncommitted,--on whom they not infrequently lived, and to whom they\r\nlooked for relief in their necessities. A reference to the Journal\r\nwill establish the fact of their appointment, because it is so\r\ndeclared in the speeches of the Indians, delivered in public Council.\r\nIf the Indians, in open Council, declare what shall be done with a\r\npart of the consideration money of their land and, according to their\r\ncustom, insist that their principal Chiefs shall be provided for out\r\nof it, why should it be objected to? As well might it be objected that\r\n$5000, a part of this consideration money, is appropriated at the\r\nrequest of the Chiefs to the students of the Choctaw Academy, of which\r\nsum the Honorable Richard M. Johnson is constituted Trustee.[118]\r\n\r\nIt is said also among other representations that a Frenchman called\r\nLoranger,[119] who never had goods in the Indian country, was allowed\r\nby the Commissioners on Claims $5000 by assigning his claim to Robt.\r\nA. Forsyth to whom he was indebted $3,000.\r\n\r\nIt is with difficulty Sir, that I can sufficiently command my\r\nfeelings, or control the disgust with which I am affected, at these\r\nmonstrous falsehoods, for while I would speak of them in the manner\r\nthey merit, I would not forget the respect due to you. But in the\r\nabove proposition of three lines, are stated three direct, unqualified\r\nuntruths:--First--That he had had no goods in the Indian Country which\r\ncould be refuted by a common clamor. Second--That he assigned his\r\nclaim to Major Forsyth; and Third--That he was indebted to him for\r\n$3000.--I have already named Mr. Daniel Jackson, of the firm of\r\nSuydam, Jackson & Co., of N. Y. who are so extensively engaged in the\r\nsale of Indian Goods--Of him I would ask how long he has known Mr.\r\nLoranger to be in the Indian trade, and what has been the amount of\r\ngoods sold yearly to Mr. Loranger--The claim of Mr. Loranger was much\r\ngreater than the allowance--The balance is lost to him, because not\r\npresented at the Treaty in Indiana in October 1832, being due by that\r\nBand or Party of Potawatamie Indians--He has been in the Indian trade\r\nsince 1804, and lives within sight of this town.\r\n\r\nI had intended to close this communication here; but I cannot remain\r\nsilent, while slanders are heaped upon the gallant dead. The\r\ncharacters and memories of John Kinzie and Robert A. Forsyth deceased\r\nhave been wickedly assailed--and by whom? Their descendants would like\r\nto know--For the part each one of these individuals took, and the\r\nimportant services rendered by them to the American Government in the\r\nlate war, reference is made to many of the first men in the country;\r\nAmong those immediately around you is the Secretary of War, Major\r\nGeneral Macomb, General Gratiot and Colonel Croghan.--Having\r\nconsidered it my duty to make inquiry I have obtained the following\r\ninformation and believing it to be strictly correct, I give it to you\r\nas such.--\r\n\r\n     Memoir of the late John Kinzie of Michigan.[120]\r\n\r\nJohn Kinzie died at Chicago in 1828, aged 64 years; he came to this\r\npart of the Country when a boy and was in the Indian trade during the\r\ngreater part of his life. He went to Chicago, Illinois, in 1803--was\r\nSutler for the United States troops for several years, and was the\r\nfirst to take from Detroit the news of the declaration of War, to\r\nCaptain Heald then commanding the Fort at that place.[121] On the eve\r\nof the massacre at Chicago, Mr. Kinzie with two friendly Indian\r\nChiefs, called at Captain Heald’s quarters, and advised him not to\r\nabandon the Fort as was contemplated the next morning, but to remain\r\nas long as possible; for if he left it he would certainly be attacked\r\nby the Indians, who had collected to the number of five hundred\r\nwarriors.--Captain Heald persisted in going--said he had orders from\r\nGenl. Hull to evacuate the post, and to proceed with his command to\r\nFort Wayne. Captain Heald then requested Mr. Kinzie to accompany him,\r\nwhich he did, leaving his family with but three men to protect them on\r\ntheir way to St. Joseph (distant by water 100 miles). Mr. Kinzie’s\r\nfamily were taken prisoners a few hours previous to the massacre. Mr.\r\nKinzie was in the battle, as well as one daughter, the wife of\r\nLieutenant Helm, whose horse was shot from under her. She received a\r\nwound in the foot from the ball which killed her horse. Mr. Kinzie was\r\ntaken prisoner with the surviving command of Captain Heald. Having\r\nbeen long a principal trader among these Indians, and much esteemed by\r\nthem, he was next day by a Council held by the Chiefs, liberated, and\r\nhis family restored to him.\r\n\r\nHe then prevailed upon the Indians to surrender to him Captain Heald\r\nand family, whom he furnished with conveyance to Mackinac.[122] Mrs.\r\nHeald now residing at St. Louis can prove all these facts.--Having\r\nlost all his property to a very considerable amount (it being a\r\nwholesale establishment) consisting of merchandise, furs and peltries\r\nand horses, etc., taken by the Indians, he went to Detroit. His\r\ninfluence while there was directed toward affecting a change in the\r\nviews and feelings of the Indians at that time unfriendly to the\r\nAmerican Government. This influence with the different tribes of\r\nIndians was very considerable and as a proof of it General Proctor\r\ncommanding the British force in Detroit and its vicinity sent for Mr.\r\nKinzie, and when he went to see him General Proctor immediately\r\nconfined him as he said “for daring to prejudice the Indians against\r\nhis Majesty’s subjects or forces, and would send him where he would\r\nnot see an Indian in a hurry.”--Mr. Kinzie was twice rescued by\r\nseveral Indian Chiefs, and once in the presence of General Proctor\r\nhimself. Mr. Kinzie was again taken by General Proctor and _closely\r\nconfined in irons_ at Fort Malden (as also a Mr. Jean Bte Chandonnois\r\nwho subsequently made his escape and is now living in the St. Joseph\r\ncountry) and kept there for months. He was finally, to conceal him\r\nfrom the Indians, sent off in the night in irons--was treated in the\r\nmost brutal manner by his guard, and was shipped for England for\r\ntrial--Fortunately for him, the Ship lost her rudder, and she was\r\nobliged to put into Halifax, having on board a great number of\r\nAmerican prisoners.--He thence made his escape in a crowd of paroled\r\nprisoners, and returned to his family in Detroit, after it had been\r\ntaken possession of by General Harrison’s Army. Mr. Kinzie had not\r\nbeen long at home before he was called upon by Colonel Croghan, and\r\naccompaned the expedition under him to Mackinac, and was Captain of a\r\nparty of Militia at the battle fought on the Island of Dousman’s Farm.\r\nMr. Kinzie, after the close of the War, held the appointment of Sub\r\nIndian Agent for many years at Chicago.--He was well known to Generals\r\nHarrison, Macomb, Gratiot, and Col. Croghan.--During the time of\r\nhostilities, his energies were always devoted to the American cause.\r\n\r\nRobert A. Forsyth was long and extensively engaged in the Indian\r\ntrade.--His residence was at Detroit and his trading establishments in\r\ndifferent places in the Indian Country. He not only enjoyed the\r\nconfidence of the Indians but that of his fellow citizens. Every\r\nhonest man then resident of Detroit can attest to his bravery during\r\nthe late War. Such had been his conduct that, on the surrender of\r\nDetroit, he was marked as a fit subject for British vengeance.--He was\r\ntorn from his family and with his only son, the present Major Forsyth,\r\nthen a boy of about fourteen years, put on board the British vessels\r\nand carried off; his several infant daughters being left without a\r\nprotector; their father’s house occupied by the British troops; and\r\nall his valuable property pillaged and carried away. Being landed on\r\nparol at Erie, Penn., the father and son soon afterwards found their\r\nway to General Harrison’s Army. This gentleman can attest to the many\r\nvaluable services which they rendered. The father died in the year\r\n1813, in the service of his country, without having been permitted to\r\nreturn to his family:--Being early enured to the hardships of trading\r\namong the Indians and being naturally active and brave the son\r\nfrequently performed duties, from undertaking which others were\r\ndeterred by their severity and danger. For the history of the son, the\r\nhardships he encountered, his important services before, and his\r\ngallant conduct during the war, I refer you to the Honourable Lewis\r\nCass, who is familiar with its details.\r\n\r\nI have now, Sir, I believe, with one exception, gone over the whole\r\nground. That exception relates to the furnishing of goods by Mr.\r\nKercheval and Mr. Kinzie, and as it has no connection with the Treaty\r\nof Chicago, being in fulfilment of the stipulations of previous\r\ntreaties, and in the making of which I had no agency, and concerns\r\nmyself exclusively, I shall make it the subject of a communication to\r\naccompany this.\r\n\r\nThe question so insidiously put, of whether “the Governor does not\r\nsecretly reap a share of the plunder” I cannot, consistently with the\r\nrespect due myself, answer.--Whether I have forgotten principle and\r\ncharacter, and everything dear to an honourable mind, to defile my\r\nhands with the contamination of a bribe, is a question others must\r\nsettle for me.--\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have only to add that, to the issue I have here made\r\nup, I commit without shadow of fear of the result, what is dearer to\r\nme than all else--my reputation and good name.\r\n\r\n                                            [G. B. PORTER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     [112] The State Historical Society of Wisconsin has under\r\n     preparation a volume devoted to those Indian treaties which\r\n     are of more direct interest to Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n     [113] Daniel Jackson belonged to the firm of Suydam, Jackson\r\n     and Company of New York, large importers of goods for the\r\n     fur trade. Robert Stuart was manager at Mackinac for the\r\n     American Fur Company. Porter’s appeal to these men is not\r\n     entirely convincing, since they were important\r\n     representatives of the fur trade merchants who, as a class,\r\n     profited most largely by the gratuities and allowances\r\n     concerning which complaint was being made.\r\n\r\n     [114] Richard J. Hamilton came to Chicago in 1831 as first\r\n     clerk of the circuit court of Cook County. During the next\r\n     few years he held a large number of local offices of a legal\r\n     or fiscal nature, much of the time holding several at the\r\n     same time. He had much to do with the establishment and\r\n     early administration of the public school system of Chicago.\r\n\r\n     [115] Robert A. Forsythe of Ohio was an early trader at\r\n     Maumee City in Lucas County. He was probably the son of\r\n     James Forsythe, an early merchant and tavern keeper of\r\n     Detroit. He was one of the founders of the lower Maumee\r\n     Valley.\r\n\r\n     [116] The pronouncement of Meriwether Lewis to President\r\n     Jefferson on this point, given in a case which involved the\r\n     same principle as the one here involved, is not without\r\n     interest in this connection: “I am confident that, if the\r\n     United States should never confirm the lands to the present\r\n     claimants, it will not prove a source of disquiet on the\r\n     part of the Osages; and should they be ever countenanced or\r\n     receive confirmation, on the ground of their being Indian\r\n     donations, it would introduce a policy of the most ruinous\r\n     tendency to the interests of the United States; in effect it\r\n     would be, the Government corrupting its own agents; for, I\r\n     will venture to assert, that, if the Indians are permitted\r\n     to bestow lands on such individuals as they may think\r\n     proper, the meanest interpreter in our employment will soon\r\n     acquire a princely fortune at the expense of the United\r\n     States.” _American State Papers, Indian Affairs_, I, 767.\r\n\r\n     [117] Billy Caldwell and Alexander Robinson, halfbreeds, who\r\n     were influential with the Potawatomi and the Ottawa.\r\n\r\n     [118] Unfortunately for Porter’s justification in this\r\n     particular instance, the investigations of students have\r\n     revealed much that is of questionable propriety in\r\n     connection with Johnson’s conduct of his Indian school.\r\n\r\n     [119] Joseph Loranger was a fur trader in the River Raisin\r\n     and before the War of 1812 had a store in partnership with\r\n     Lafontaine. In 1817 he platted the town of Monroe, Michigan,\r\n     of which place his descendants were prominent citizens.\r\n\r\n     [120] The correctness of this narrative is not above\r\n     question in all respects. In general it may be noted that\r\n     Porter was bent on presenting a favorable account of\r\n     Kinzie’s career, and that he evidently drew his information\r\n     from friendly sources. Nevertheless, it constitutes an\r\n     interesting addition to our sources of information\r\n     concerning Kinzie, the reputed “father of Chicago.”\r\n\r\n     [121] Kinzie removed to Chicago in 1804, the year following\r\n     the establishment of Fort Dearborn. The statement that he\r\n     brought the news of war to Fort Dearborn is incorrect.\r\n\r\n     [122] This statement is in contradiction with our other\r\n     sources of information on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL FRAGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISPUTED MICHIGAN-WISCONSIN BOUNDARY\r\n\r\nBoundary disputes have ever constituted a fruitful source of\r\ncontention between men and nations. Probably no people has more\r\nfrequently engaged in them than our own, although, contrary to\r\nOld-World precedent, we commonly wage our boundary contentions\r\nverbally rather than with arms. Wisconsin, like others of the\r\nsisterhood of states, was early in its history a party to a number of\r\nboundary disputes, the fruits of victory commonly going, at least in\r\nlocal contemporary judgment, to her opponents. Since Wisconsin has\r\nbecome a state, boundary disputes have until recent years ceased. Two\r\nsuch have, however, arisen within the twentieth century and are still\r\npending, one with the state of Minnesota, the other with that of\r\nMichigan. The former is in process of settlement by due governmental\r\nprocedure, and accordingly no discussion of it would now be useful.\r\nThe latter is at present in a state of quiescence; yet the boundary\r\nparagraphs of the constitutions of Michigan and of Wisconsin contain\r\nmutually contradictory clauses with respect to a strip of territory\r\nover which Michigan claims and Wisconsin exercises jurisdiction.\r\nMoreover, the overtures of our northern neighbor a few years since\r\nlooking to a determination of the question met on our part with\r\nrebuff. Sooner or later, the issue will have to be determined; pending\r\nthis, an historical résumé of the points at issue may be of some\r\ninterest, especially to Wisconsin readers.\r\n\r\nThe boundary between Michigan and Wisconsin was first determined in\r\nthe act that in 1836 created Wisconsin Territory. In ignorance of the\r\nreal geography of the region this act described a supposititious line,\r\nunder the belief that the Montreal River had its source in Lake Vieux\r\nDesert. Two years later Congress appropriated $3,000 for the survey of\r\nthe Michigan-Wisconsin boundary. The appropriation was considered\r\ninsufficient and no attempt was made to run the line until 1841. Then,\r\nthe matter having been transferred to the War Department, an army\r\nengineer, Lieutenant Thomas J. Cram, was detailed to undertake the\r\nsurvey. Cram spent the summer of 1841 in Wisconsin’s northern forests,\r\nascertained many facts about the lakes and streams therein, and\r\nreported them to the department. Two years later Cram was again\r\ndetailed to search for the true Wisconsin-Michigan boundary. He spent\r\nfour months under conditions involving much hardship, in the attempt\r\nto determine the line as nearly as possible in accordance with\r\nofficial description. In the report which he made to the head of his\r\ndepartment he recommended the abandonment of Lake Vieux Desert as a\r\ndeterminating factor in the interstate boundary line.[123]\r\n\r\nThe determination of the line rested until 1846, when, in the enabling\r\nact providing for the admission of Wisconsin, Congress established the\r\nline “to the mouth of the Menominee river; thence up the channel of\r\nthe said river to the Brulé river; thence up said last mentioned river\r\nto Lake Brulé; thence along the southern shore of Lake Brulé in a\r\ndirect line to the center of the channel between Middle and South\r\nIslands, in the Lake of the Desert [Vieux Desert]; thence in a direct\r\nline to the head waters of the Montreal river, as marked upon the\r\nsurvey made by Captain Cramm; thence down the main channel of the\r\nMontreal river to the middle of Lake Superior.” The constitution of\r\nMichigan, adopted in 1850, repeated the boundary article of\r\nWisconsin’s enabling act with only slight verbal changes, including\r\nthe omission of Captain Cram’s name. The fundamental laws of the two\r\nstates were thus in accord concerning the line separating these\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, in 1847 a portion of the boundary was surveyed by\r\nWilliam A. Burt, under the direction of Lucius Lyon.[124] Burt took\r\nthe contract on April 27 and performed his work during the succeeding\r\nsummer months. The field notes of his survey do not accompany his\r\nprinted report, but Lyon stated that Burt’s notes would be forwarded\r\nlater, and no doubt they are yet preserved in the General Land Office\r\nat Washington. From these field notes it might be ascertained why\r\nSurveyor Burt chose the eastern branch as the “main channel of the\r\nsaid Montreal river.” In so doing he assigned to Wisconsin 360 square\r\nmiles of land that now include the towns of Hurley and Van Buskirk.\r\nHad he chosen the western branch, rising in the Island Lake as the\r\nMontreal’s headwaters, the jurisdiction of this strip would have\r\nrested in Michigan.\r\n\r\nNo one undertook to investigate the matter until quite recent years.\r\nThen Hon. Peter White of Marquette, Michigan, believing that his state\r\nwas illegally deprived of the land between the two branches of the\r\nMontreal River, had a survey thereof made at his private expense.\r\nWhite’s surveyors ascertained, to their own and his satisfaction, that\r\nthe western branch was the “main” channel of the Montreal River.\r\nMeanwhile Mr. White had interested in Michigan’s claims Clarence W.\r\nBurton of Detroit, the president of the State Historical Commission.\r\nBurton discovered that one of Burt’s surveyors, George H. Cannon, was\r\nstill living, and arranged for the publication of an article from his\r\npen supporting White’s contention that Michigan had been wrongfully\r\ndeprived of a portion of her upper peninsula.[125]\r\n\r\nShortly after this, in 1907, Michigan held a convention to prepare a\r\nnew constitution for the state. Burton was chosen a member of this\r\nbody, and became chairman of the committee on boundaries. That\r\ncommittee, without discussion upon the floor of the convention, had\r\nthe boundary article of the new constitution drawn to read: “thence in\r\na direct line through Lake Superior to the mouth of the Montreal\r\nriver; thence through the middle of the main channel of the westerly\r\nbranch of the Montreal river to Island Lake, the head waters thereof,\r\nthence in a direct line to the center,” etc. This became part of\r\nMichigan’s fundamental law on February 21, 1908.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in 1907 two resolutions passed the Michigan legislature. The\r\nfirst, after reciting the mistakes in Captain “Cramm’s” surveys,\r\nauthorized the governor to appoint a commissioner to visit Wisconsin\r\nin order to secure a joint commission for the adjudication of the\r\nboundary. In pursuance of this resolution the governor appointed Hon.\r\nPeter White to this office. He came to Madison twice, but could not\r\ninterest the state’s officials in his enterprise, and was unable to\r\nsecure any promise of participation in a joint commission. In June,\r\n1908, Mr. White died, and so far as known no successor to him as\r\nboundary commissioner has ever been appointed.\r\n\r\nThe second Michigan resolution of 1907 authorized the attorney-general\r\nto direct a survey of the state’s northwest boundary, and also to\r\ninstitute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure a\r\nrectification of the boundary line. Acting on this authorization the\r\nattorney-general employed Professor J. B. Davis, of the University of\r\nMichigan, to investigate the survey and prepare a brief of Michigan’s\r\nclaims. The result of Professor Davis’ investigation has not yet been\r\ngiven to the world. A chronicler of Michigan wrote in 1908 that “in\r\nview of the political excitement of the presidential year no active\r\nmeasures [concerning the disputed territory] are likely to be taken\r\nthis season.” On another page the author expresses a doubt “whether\r\nthe state of Michigan can ever occupy the territory justly hers.” He\r\nconcludes with the observation that it “is believed to be the only\r\ninstance in this nation where two sovereign states are occupying a\r\ndividing line of doubtful legality, merely by common consent.”[126]\r\n\r\n                                         LOUISE P. KELLOGG.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EARLY WISCONSIN PLAY\r\n\r\nIn the collection of Mr. Henry Cady Sturges, of New York, there is a\r\ncopy (the only one the writer has seen) of a play which, while it may\r\nnot be the earliest, is certainly one of the first printed in\r\nMilwaukee. While the plot of the production is laid in New York and is\r\nlargely local in interest, yet the fact that it was printed in\r\nWisconsin, and the further fact that no other edition seems to be\r\nknown, makes it fairly certain that it is the offspring of a writer\r\nwho lived in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThe piece bears title as follows: “_The Drummer, / or / New York\r\nClerks / and / Country Merchants. / A Local Play, / in two acts._ / (2\r\nlines of verse.). / Edited by Mrs. Partington. / Milwaukee:/ Job Press\r\nof Cary & Rounds. / Commercial Advertiser Office./ 1851./” It has 73 +\r\n1 pages and paper covers, the front cover bearing the same title as\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nA curious coincidence regarding the characters in the play is that the\r\nfather of the present owner, Jonathan Sturges, is among them, his part\r\nbeing that of “Mr. Sturges, a New York Merchant,” that really being\r\nhis occupation. “Mrs. Partington” is also among the characters.\r\n\r\nThis curious production was written at the time of the Jenny Lind\r\nexcitement, and that great singer is mentioned in a number of places\r\nthroughout the play. Her manager, P. T. Barnum, is there also, while\r\nsome of the localities noted are Coney Island, Niblo’s, The Bowery,\r\nand Castle Garden. The first act takes place, first in a saloon on\r\nBroadway, and afterwards in the office of a first class hotel, also on\r\nthat well-known thoroughfare. The second act is staged in Mrs.\r\nPartington’s parlor in the same hotel.\r\n\r\nSome of the popular books of the period are mentioned, among them _New\r\nYork in Slices_, while among the names of well-known New Yorkers are\r\nHorace Greeley and James Gordon Bennett, editor of the _Herald_.\r\nMilwaukee is hinted at, and Mr. Sturges is made to say by the\r\nplaywright as he addresses his clerks, “Fourteen hundred dollars from\r\nWisconsin. Extremely good. Wisconsin crops are nearly all destroyed,\r\nstill the money is sure to come from that state. More goods are\r\nordered, they shall have them.”\r\n\r\nThe play is interspersed with songs that are saturated with the\r\nalleged humor of the period, and sad to relate, one of these songs has\r\nbeen torn from the copy before me, probably because of its facetious\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if the writer ever intended to have his production\r\nstaged, although the copy now described has several corrections such\r\nas are found in prompt copies.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe that the statement on the title that its\r\neditor was Mrs. Partington (Benj. P. Shillaber) was simply put on to\r\nadd to the humor of the occasion, as I doubt if Shillaber had a hand\r\nin its composition.\r\n\r\nOn page 73 is the statement that copyright has been secured.\r\n\r\nFrom a perusal of the piece it seems evident that its author knew the\r\nmetropolis very well, but the misspelling of proper names and other\r\nevidence makes it seem almost certain that it was the work of some\r\none, who, while well acquainted with New York, was not a permanent\r\nresident of that city. Was he a writer from Wisconsin? If so, who was\r\nhe, and why was he writing a play of this character, a piece whose\r\nplot was taken from a place so far from home?\r\n\r\n                                             OSCAR WEGELIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [123] Lieutenant Cram’s maps are reproduced in _Michigan\r\n     Pioneer and Historical Collections_, XXXVIII, 386-87.

Colonel\r\nTom Brown, a former citizen of Badgerdom, who now resides in Sioux\r\nFalls, South Dakota, has achieved this distinction, we believe, in\r\nrelating the following incident. In view of the nature of our leading\r\narticle, and of the local interest which attaches to Mr. Brown’s tale,\r\nwe gladly give it such additional currency as lies within our power.\r\n\r\nIn some sections of southwestern Wisconsin during the Civil War, so\r\nthe story runs, certain copperhead organizations, particularly the\r\nKnights of the Golden Circle, became decidedly outspoken in the\r\nexpression of their sentiments--so much so that a group of loyal\r\ncitizens decided to send a spokesman to Washington to acquaint the\r\nPresident with the threatening proceedings. The delegate chosen for\r\nthis mission was a certain Professor Kilgore of Evansville Seminary.\r\nOn his arrival at Washington he was invited to take lunch at the White\r\nHouse, where he was seated next to President Lincoln himself. At this\r\ntime finger bowls were coming into fashion, but their advent had not\r\nas yet come within the ken of the simple western professor.\r\nAccordingly he was greatly perplexed by the little dish, containing a\r\nslice of lemon and some liquid, apparently lemonade, which appeared\r\nnear the close of the meal. Observing his embarrassment, President\r\nLincoln, leaning toward him, whispered, “Professor, don’t sip out of\r\nthat bowl, watch me.”\r\n\r\nFollowing this kindly instruction the pedagogue concluded the meal\r\nwithout disgracing himself. When, later, they found themselves alone\r\ntogether, President Lincoln confided to the visitor that he himself\r\nneeded a servant to keep him informed about “those little things.”\r\n\r\nWe cannot vouch for the truth of the story, although it rests on\r\nbetter authority than most of the tales that are told about Lincoln.\r\nHowever authentic its details, it presents a trait of homely kindness,\r\nthe possession of which constitutes one of the most attractive aspects\r\nof Lincoln’s personality.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINTING OF HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe last day of the year brings to hand the January, 1917, number of\r\nthe quarterly _Journal_ of a neighboring state historical society.\r\nWhat the local conditions may be which render it necessary to be a\r\nyear behind with the publication of this periodical, we are unaware.\r\nReference is made to it by way of calling attention to a practice\r\nwhich is all too common with respect to the issuance of historical\r\nperiodicals and other publications. If a quarterly must appear six\r\nmonths or a year late it would seem to be a fair question whether its\r\nappearance at all is worth while. If such delays are due to the\r\nslackness or incompetency of the editor, the proper authorities should\r\napply a much needed stimulant. If they are due to conditions beyond\r\nthe editor’s control, reform (in the quarter responsible for the\r\ndelay) is still desirable. We suspect that commonly such delays are\r\ncaused by the state printers, by whom, at least in the Middle West,\r\nhistorical publications are generally issued. We speak the more\r\nfeelingly on the subject because our own Society is not immune from\r\nthe criticism under discussion. The printer dallied for a year over\r\nour most recently issued volume, while it required six months to get a\r\nforty-page bulletin printed. It avails little for editors to be\r\npunctual and businesslike in turning out their work, if it may then be\r\nhung up indefinitely by the printer, with the editor deprived of any\r\nmeans of amending the situation. Quite possibly state printers are\r\nthemselves the victims of a system the amendment of which is beyond\r\ntheir control. Of this we have no particular knowledge. Wherever the\r\nresponsibility may justly be placed, the manner in which most public\r\nprinting is done in this country offers a severe commentary upon our\r\nboasted American efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS WAR BECOMING MORE HORRIBLE?\r\n\r\nThere is an ancient story concerning a grave debate indulged in by a\r\ngroup of English philosophers during the Stuart period over the\r\nquestion why a fish does not weigh anything when in the water. At\r\nlength it occurred to one of them to weigh a vessel of water with a\r\nfish in it, and again with the fish removed. As a result of this\r\nsimple test the philosophers were forced to seek a new subject upon\r\nwhich to exercise their wits. At the present time it seems to be\r\ngenerally assumed that with the invention of new implements of warfare\r\nand of improvements upon old ones the horrors of war have steadily\r\nincreased; in particular, that the present war is far more horrible to\r\nthose who participate in it than any of its predecessors in the\r\nhistory of the human race have been. Such a belief as this entails\r\nobvious consequences affecting not only the peace of mind of our\r\npeople but, in the last analysis, the success of the cause to which\r\nour nation is committed. For if it is indeed true that our young\r\nmanhood is going to certain death under circumstances more awful than\r\nthe pages of military history have hitherto ever recorded, our\r\nwillingness as individuals to send our loved ones to meet such a fate\r\nmust be seriously shaken by the prospect; while, collectively, the\r\nwill of the nation to persist in the war upon which we have embarked\r\nwill be similarly affected. In a word, such an impression gravely\r\nthreatens the morale of the nation, including both those who go to war\r\nand those who send them forth. That our Teutonic foemen have not been\r\nunmindful of this is amply evidenced by the new and hellish\r\nconnotation which in recent years they have succeeded in attaching to\r\nthe word _shrecklichkeit_. To German _shrecklichkeit_ we will pay our\r\nrespects presently. Meanwhile we desire to deal with the question\r\nwhether under the influence of modern science and invention the\r\nconduct of warfare has in fact become increasingly horrible.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME LEAVES FROM THE PAST\r\n\r\nWe believe it can be shown, on the contrary, that the direct opposite\r\nis true; that the warfare waged by primitive peoples and in ancient\r\ntimes was a far more horrible procedure than is that waged by\r\ncivilized nations today. It may be taken as axiomatic that the horrors\r\nof battle, like the transports of love, increase as the distance\r\nbetween the parties concerned diminishes. All savage warfare, and all\r\ncivilized warfare as well, until a very recent date, was waged at\r\nclose range. In ancient and in medieval times men battled hand to hand\r\nwith spear and sword and ax. The vanquished found slight opportunity\r\nto escape and the hand of the conqueror was stayed by no\r\nconsiderations of twentieth century humanity. The chronicles of the\r\nHebrews, the Lord’s anointed, and the narratives of Alexander the\r\nGreat and Julius Cæsar tell alike the same general tale of slaughter\r\nof the opposing warriors and the slaughter, rapine, or enslavement, as\r\nthe case might be, of their dependents. In medieval times, it is true,\r\nunder the influence of the institution of knighthood, certain rules\r\nforeshadowing the modern rules of war were developed. But these more\r\nhumane rules applied only to the aristocracy, the commoner being\r\nexcluded from their operation and benefits.\r\n\r\nWith the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries came two developments of\r\nmuch importance for their bearing upon our subject. The one was the\r\napplication of gunpowder to the art of war, as the result of which war\r\nwas democratized; the business of knighthood soon became as dead as\r\nCæsar’s ghost, and as firearms improved, the distances at which\r\nopposing armies fought slowly widened. The other was an indirect\r\nresult of the Dutch war for independence. Meditating upon the terrible\r\nbrutalities to which his people were subjected by it, Hugo Grotius\r\nevolved the treatise on the laws of war and peace which by common\r\nconsent has ever since been regarded as the foundation of modern\r\ninternational law. Grotius sought, in a word, to humanize warfare by\r\nsecuring the establishment by common agreement of rules calculated to\r\nprohibit its more debasing and awful manifestations. In the three\r\nhundred years ending with August, 1914, much progress was made, both\r\nalong the lines laid down by Grotius and in other ways, looking to the\r\nminimizing of the horrors of war. At the same time, ever more\r\ningenious and powerful death-dealing appliances were being devised for\r\nthe waging of such combat as the rules of international law still\r\nrendered permissible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMANITARIANISM\r\n\r\nNotable progress, too, was being made along another line.\r\nHumanitarianism in its modern connotation is the child of the\r\nnineteenth century. To feel distress over the knowledge that famine or\r\nother ill afflicts a distant people is a purely modern accomplishment\r\nof which our forefathers of two or three centuries ago were wholly\r\ninnocent. As applied to armies, the humanitarian impulse has worked a\r\nstartling revolution. Organizations designed to care for the sick and\r\nthe wounded have developed on an elaborate scale. The Red Cross was\r\ncalled into being only half a century ago as an indirect result of the\r\nhorrors of the battlefield of Solferino. It was born too late to have\r\nany share in alleviating the miseries of our own Civil War but since\r\nthat time it has constituted an ever increasing agency for the relief\r\nof human suffering, whether in peace or in war. Even the “unspeakable\r\nTurk” has been infected by the virus of humanitarianism and the Red\r\nCrescent plays for the Mohammedan world the rôle fulfilled by the Red\r\nCross among the nations of Christendom.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER AGENCIES\r\n\r\nThe progress made in recent years in the fields of medicine and\r\nsurgery has been no less striking than in that of humanitarianism;\r\nwhile the development of a new social consciousness (a concomitant, of\r\ncourse, of the humanitarian movement) has resulted in throwing about\r\nthe soldier who wars for America in 1918 a set of safeguards, and in\r\nproviding him with a degree of comfort such as no other warriors in\r\nthe history of the world ever enjoyed. Against drunkenness and vice,\r\ntwin plagues of army life since the beginning of the world, he is at\r\nleast as well protected as is the civilian at home. Libraries and\r\nclubhouses and games and lectures are provided with unstinted\r\ngenerosity for his recreation and instruction. That his mind may be\r\nfree from incidental worry, a system of life insurance on a scale\r\nhitherto undreamed of has been evolved; while the wife or other\r\ndependents at home are insured by the largess of a parental government\r\nagainst coming to actual want during his absence.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME FACTS AND FIGURES\r\n\r\nAll these things will avail little to comfort the soldier or his loved\r\nones if it is in fact true that he is being sent to a certain and\r\nawful death--if his span of life, after reaching France, is limited to\r\na few weeks, and after reaching the front line trenches to a few hours\r\nor minutes. Let us proceed, then, to weigh this particular fish. We\r\ncan do it only approximately, for it is inherent in the nature of\r\nwarfare that accurate, dependable statistics are commonly lacking, or\r\nextremely difficult to obtain. The testimony of such as we have,\r\nhowever, is all in support of the view that never before in civilized\r\nwarfare has the individual soldier had so good a prospect of surviving\r\nthe term of his enlistment and returning once more to the homeland as\r\nnow. It is not contended, of course, that modern war is simply a\r\npleasant pastime from which all will return unscathed, but merely that\r\nthe current impression concerning its having become more awful and\r\nmore fatal than in times past is incorrect. According to respectable\r\nauthority the casualties in the entire French army in proportion to\r\nmobilized strength amounted, for the first six months of 1915, to 2.39\r\nper cent. Since then the ratio has steadily decreased, the figure for\r\nthe last six months of 1916 being 1.28 per cent. At the beginning of\r\nthe war, for the battles of Charleroi and the Marne, when the French\r\nsuffered more heavily than at any time since, the casualties were 5.41\r\nper cent of the mobilized strength of the army. In other words during\r\nthe period of greatest danger in the entire war but five men in every\r\nhundred received wounds, while, of these five, it is a safe\r\ngeneralization to say that only one died as a result thereof.\r\n\r\nIn view of the enormous numbers of men in the present war, the\r\nabsolute figures of losses are appalling enough. Relatively, however,\r\nthe losses are lower than in many previous wars. In no great battle of\r\nthe war, probably, has the individual soldier stood so good a chance\r\nof being wounded or killed as did those--to mention a few cases\r\nonly--who fought at Fredericksburg or Gettysburg, at Stone River or\r\nChickamauga, at Waterloo, at Aspern, at Borodino, or Leipsic. At\r\nFredericksburg, Burnside lost, in a few hours, one-tenth of his army,\r\nthe loss in that portion actively engaged amounting to 16 per cent; at\r\nGettysburg, in three days, one-fifth of the Union army and almost\r\none-third of the Confederate army were killed or wounded; at\r\nChickamauga and at Stone River over one-fourth of the Confederate\r\nforces engaged were lost, while the casualties sustained by Grant’s\r\narmy in the seven-days’ wilderness battles amounted to the same\r\nappalling proportion. As to the Napoleonic wars, at Waterloo 40 per\r\ncent of the French army--30,000 out of 74,000--were lost in a few\r\nhours’ time; at Austerlitz, the French, although overwhelmingly\r\nvictorious, lost almost one-ninth of the army in one day’s fighting,\r\nwhile the allies lost nearly half of theirs; at Borodino, in a single\r\nday, the victorious French suffered casualties of 22½ per cent, the\r\ndefeated Russians casualties of 50 per cent of the armies engaged; at\r\nAspern, a drawn battle, both French and Austrians lost, in killed and\r\nwounded, over one-fourth of the total armies engaged; at Albuera over\r\none-fourth of the French and one-fifth of the allied armies were lost,\r\nbut the British force, which bore the brunt of the allied fighting,\r\nlost 4,100 men out of a total of 8,000 engaged. In the present war,\r\nbecause of an unrescinded order, we are told, a Canadian detachment of\r\n800 left 600 men on the field. But this is more than matched on both\r\nsides at Gettysburg, where with no mistake in orders one Confederate\r\nregiment lost 720 men out of 800, while a Union regiment lost 82 per\r\ncent of the men engaged. Sixty-two Union regiments in this war\r\nsustained losses in some single battle in excess of 50 per cent, a\r\nrecord equalled on the southern side by forty-three regiments. Those\r\nkilled in action today are as irrevocably dead as those killed in any\r\nformer war; but of those merely wounded (about four-fifths of all\r\nbattle casualties) the prospect of recovering is incomparably better\r\nthan in any previous war, while the prospect of death from disease\r\nincurred in service is likewise vastly diminished.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAVERY THEN AND NOW\r\n\r\nIt is a foible of most peoples in all generations fondly to picture\r\nthemselves as braver and hardier than those of other races and times.\r\nSo, in the present war, it is commonly assumed that greater demands\r\nupon the soldier’s fortitude and courage are made than in times gone\r\nby. In fact, however, bravery has been throughout the ages probably\r\nthe commonest attribute of mankind. Soldiers are as brave today as in\r\nformer times, but no more so. To contemplate a modern bayonet charge\r\nor a fight at close grips with gun-butt and knife is far from\r\npleasant. But whereas such fighting is the occasional or exceptional\r\nthing today, of old it was the normal mode of fighting. The idea that\r\ncombat should be waged at a distance was born only with the\r\ndevelopment of smokeless powder and high-power rifles. As late as\r\nCromwell’s time the pike was the main reliance of infantry in battle.\r\nThe favorite tactics of Napoleon were based on the idea of\r\noverwhelming the opposing army by the shock of mass formations. At\r\nWaterloo, for hours his splendid cavalry broke against the British\r\nsquares, riding round and round at bayonet’s length, seeking to break\r\ntheir outer line. From fighting in the open in mass formation, armies\r\nhave now largely taken to cover, even as the American Indian did;\r\npartly because of this, partly for the other reasons noted, the\r\ndangers and the horrors of war today have greatly diminished as\r\ncompared with former times. Our people should be made acquainted with\r\nthis fact, and both those who go to war and those who send them forth\r\nare entitled to such comfort as may legitimately be derived from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHRECKLICHKEIT\r\n\r\nOne general exception, however, must be taken to the comforting\r\nconclusions which have been reached. Broadly speaking, warfare among\r\nsavages knows no rules and recognizes no limitations of action or\r\nhonor. Prisoners of war may be slaughtered at once or reserved for the\r\nrefinements of torture. No distinction of treatment is made between\r\nwarriors and noncombatants. The lives, the liberty, and the\r\npossessions of the conquered social group are subjected to such\r\ndisposition as the caprice or self-interest of the conquerors may\r\ndictate. Following in the path marked out by Grotius, slowly and\r\npainfully yet none the less surely, civilized nations have humanized\r\nwarfare to a marked degree. The rules of civilized war distinguish\r\nbetween soldiers and noncombatants. The rights of the latter, both of\r\nperson and of property, have been clearly established; even as between\r\ncontending armies numerous rules have been established, all based on\r\nthe general idea of regulating and refining war in ways calculated to\r\neliminate its most horrible and debasing manifestations. In this work\r\nour own nation has played a leading part and the rules for the\r\nguidance of the Union armies adopted by President Lincoln half a\r\ncentury ago, still largely guide the conduct of nations in the waging\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nWith one awful exception, however. Moved by what atavistic influence\r\nwe know not, in striking contrast to the trend of world development\r\nduring the last three hundred years, the German government and people\r\nin the last half century have evolved the doctrine and subscribed to\r\nthe principles of _shrecklichkeit_. As briefly characterized by\r\nBismarck, this policy, or principle of conduct, aims to leave to the\r\nenemy nothing except their eyes with which to weep. It lays the ax to\r\nthe very foundation of the structure of international law, slowly\r\nreared through three hundred years of effort. For the rule of right\r\nand justice it substitutes the jungle law of tooth and fang. Under its\r\nmalign influence the whole circuit of the earth is filled with spying\r\nand treason, with fraud and strife. On the foul results of this\r\npolicy, as applied to the conduct of armies, it is superfluous to\r\ndwell when addressing readers of the present generation. No sharper\r\ncommentary upon the sad reversion of modern Germany to the customs and\r\npractices of savagery can be afforded than the fact that the rules\r\npromulgated by Lincoln for the guidance of the Union armies were\r\ndrafted by Francis Lieber, one of the most notable men ever driven\r\nfrom reactionary Prussia to seek refuge in the United States.\r\n_Shrecklichkeit_, like revolutionary France in 1792, throws down the\r\ngage of battle to the remainder of the civilized world. In 1792,\r\nhowever, revolutionary France voiced the aspirations of the future\r\nagainst the dead weight of the past. Today imperial Germany challenges\r\nthe civilization of the present and the hopes of the future in the\r\ninterest of resurgent savagery. The world is too small to contain two\r\nsuch antagonistic sets of ideals and of conduct. Either Prussian\r\n_shrecklichkeit_ or the American ideal of order based on reason and\r\njustice must prevail.\r\n\r\nMay we acquit ourselves like men and carry the fight to the finish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE QUESTION BOX\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | _The Wisconsin Historical Library has long maintained a       |\r\n  | bureau of historical information for the benefit of those who |\r\n  | care to avail themselves of the service it offers.

What is the opinion of the staff as to the time?\r\n     He was supposed to be the first permanent settler. A line\r\n     will be appreciated.\r\n\r\n                                          H. E. COLE,\r\n                                      _Baraboo, Wisconsin_.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your difficulty in determining the time of the advent of\r\nAbraham Wood on your river, because of the conflict in the\r\nauthorities. So far as we can determine, the account in the _Wisconsin\r\nHistorical Atlas_ seems to be the most authoritative. The sketches in\r\nthis volume were carefully written, and were obtained from survivors\r\nthen alive. According to that statement the first man who attempted\r\nsettlement at the Baraboo Rapids in 1837 was Archibald Barker, who\r\nthen lived at Portage. He was driven off by the Indians. Meanwhile the\r\ntreaty at Washington had been negotiated, and there seemed more hope\r\nthat a settlement might be made. In the spring or early summer of 1839\r\na man named James Alban discovered Devil’s Lake, and he went back to\r\nPortage and told Eben Peck, first settler at Madison. Peck had just\r\nsold out at the latter place to Robert Ream, and he and Alban set out\r\nup the Baraboo and marked out a site at the Rapids, including the\r\nwater power. As Peck was going back (after a stay of some weeks),\r\napparently he met Wallace Rowan and Abraham Wood, whom he had known\r\nwell at Madison, coming up from Portage. They staked out their claim\r\nat Lyons, where Wood spent the winter.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile James Van Slyke came up from Walworth County in the\r\nfall of 1839 and determined to jump Peck’s claim. Van Slyke had had\r\nhis claim at Lake Geneva jumped by other parties, and was in a bitter\r\nand retaliatory frame of mind. After staking out his claim to the\r\nrapids of the Baraboo he went back to Walworth and interested James\r\nMaxwell in a plan for a mill and persuaded him to furnish the irons\r\nand equipment. Van Slyke went up in the spring of 1840 and built a dam\r\nwhich was carried out by the freshet of June. Meanwhile, Peck had\r\nbrought his claim before the court at Madison and obtained judgment\r\nagainst Van Slyke. The latter had already abandoned the enterprise.\r\nVan Slyke sold his irons to Wood and Rowan, who during the summer\r\nstarted a sawmill at the upper rapids.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be every evidence that the source of this account was\r\nthe Peck family, who were in a position to know the facts. If this\r\naccount is true, we suppose Wood might be called the first settler,\r\nsince he remained in the vicinity during the winter of 1839-40; but no\r\ndoubt he lived as the Indians did, if not with them, since his wife\r\nwas a squaw. He was thus not much more of a first settler than Barker,\r\nAlban, Rowan, Peck, or Van Slyke.\r\n\r\nTo return to Wood. We are unable to discover when or how he came to\r\nWisconsin. He was probably a free trapper or trader, one of the rough\r\nfrontiersmen of Scotch descent from the backwoods of Canada. In the\r\ncourse of trade he came in contact with the Decorah chiefs and took to\r\nwife one of the daughters of the tribe. He had probably been on the\r\nBaraboo often before 1839, since his squaw’s native village was near\r\nits mouth, and there her father died in 1836. Wood was not then at the\r\nBaraboo, since he was wintering near Madison. He was not at this site\r\nin 1832, so sometime between that date and 1836 he set up his wigwam\r\nat Squaw Point on Third Lake opposite the modern city of Madison.\r\n\r\nHis neighbor at this place was Wallace Rowan, a rough, good-hearted\r\nfrontiersman from Indiana with a white wife. There is a good account\r\nof Rowan in _History of Dane County_ (Chicago, 1880), 382-83. Rowan\r\nseems to have permitted Wood to place his wigwam, or whatever kind of\r\ndwelling he had, on his claim, which he entered with William B. Long\r\nin 1835.\r\n\r\nWood was on Third Lake during the winter of 1836-37, and during the\r\nsummer of 1837 he aided in building Madison, being employed as a\r\nmechanic on Peck’s log house. It seems probable that Wood spent the\r\nwinter of 1837-38 at the same place, as there is no record of him at\r\nPortage before the spring of 1838. Probably he moved away from Squaw\r\nPoint because Rowan that spring sold his claim and improvements to\r\nWilliam B. Slaughter. Rowan moved to Poynette and opened his noted\r\ntavern. Wood went to Portage, where, no doubt, he had often been\r\nbefore with the relatives of his squaw.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 work was begun on the Portage canal, and Wood opened a house\r\nof liquid refreshment just below Carpenter’s on the Wisconsin River.\r\nThere, probably in the spring of 1839, Wood killed Pawnee Blanc, a\r\nnoted Winnebago chief. Wood’s brother-in-law, John T. La Ronde, tells\r\nthe sordid story in _Wisconsin Historical Collections_, VII, 360. He\r\ndoes not give the date of the murder; Moses Paquette says (_idem_,\r\nXII, 431) that it was in 1837. Paquette probably remembered that it\r\nwas after his father’s death in 1836; but it could hardly have been in\r\n1837 since Wood was then at Madison. Our inference is that the death\r\nof Pawnee Blanc occurred in 1838 or 1839. Wood was probably anxious to\r\nleave Portage at this time; moreover in 1839 Winfield Scott went to\r\nPortage and held a council with the Winnebago concerning their removal\r\nfrom Wisconsin. Wood knew the Baraboo Valley would soon be open for\r\nsettlement. He persuaded his old friend, Rowan, to go prospecting with\r\nhim. But on their way out they found Peck and Alban had been there\r\nbefore them. Wood, not wanting to go back to Portage, spent the winter\r\nin the Baraboo woods; and the next autumn (1840) with Wallace Rowan\r\nbegan a sawmill, as La Ronde states (_Wis. Hist. Colls._, VII, 360).\r\n\r\nThe foregoing hypothesis appears to reconcile all the accounts except\r\nMoses Paquette’s date of the killing of Pawnee Blanc. The record of\r\nWood’s trial may sometime come to light. Possibly it may be preserved\r\nin the records of the court of Brown County, still kept at the\r\ncourthouse at Green Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE CHIPPEWA RIVER DURING THE FRENCH AND BRITISH RÉGIMES\r\n\r\n     Within a short time we expect to issue a special edition of\r\n     our local paper that will cover the development of the\r\n     Chippewa Valley. It struck me that possibly you could\r\n     furnish me considerable data covering the early history of\r\n     this section of the valley.\r\n\r\n                                         AL J. HARTLEY,\r\n                                      _Cornell, Wisconsin_.\r\n\r\nProbably the first white person to pass the mouth of the Chippewa was\r\nFather Louis Hennepin, who ascended the Mississippi in 1630. He\r\ndescribes the Chippewa under the name of Rivière des Boeufs (Buffalo).\r\nIt is probable that in his time the Beef Slough was part of the\r\nChippewa channel, and the present Buffalo River an affluent of the\r\nChippewa proper. In 1682 La Salle wrote a description of the rivers of\r\nWisconsin in a letter, the translation of which is found in volume\r\nsixteen of the _Collections_ of the Wisconsin Historical Society. He\r\nsays “About thirty leagues, ascending always in the same direction\r\n[above Black River], one comes to the Rivière des Boeufs which is as\r\nwide at its mouth as that of the Islinois. It is called by that name\r\nowing to the great number of those animals found there; it is followed\r\nfrom ten to twelve leagues, the water being smooth and without rapids,\r\nbordered by mountains which widen out from time to time, forming\r\nmeadows. There are several islands at its mouth, which is bordered by\r\nwoods on both sides.” La Salle’s description was without doubt taken\r\nfrom the account of Hennepin.\r\n\r\nThe next visitor to this region was Duluth, who in 1680 rescued Father\r\nHennepin from his captors, the Sioux Indians, and brought him down the\r\nMississippi and by the Wisconsin-Fox route to Green Bay. Duluth has\r\nnot left any description of the Chippewa.\r\n\r\nIn 1685 Nicolas Perrot was governor of all of this region. In the\r\n_Proceedings_ of this Society for 1915 you will find an account of\r\nPerrot’s experiences and of the Fort Antoine that he built at the\r\nmouth of the Chippewa. Perrot called the stream River of the Sauteurs,\r\nwhich was the French name for the Chippewa tribe, whom they first met\r\nat the Sault, hence Saulteurs or Sauters. Perrot seems to have been\r\nthe first person to use the name Sauteur or Chippewa for the river. It\r\nso appears on a very remarkable map drawn in 1688, and now in Paris. A\r\nfacsimile of this is in the Wisconsin Historical Library, at Madison,\r\nand a photograph appears in L. P. Kellogg’s, _Early Narratives of the\r\nNorthwest_ (New York, 1917), 342. At Fort St. Antoine, Perrot in 1689\r\nheld a great ceremony, taking possession of all the Sioux country for\r\nthe King of France. A translation of this document is found in volume\r\neleven of the _Wisconsin Historical Collections_, 35-36.\r\n\r\nThe name of the river indicates that the Chippewa was the home of some\r\nportion of the Chippewa tribe. In the early eighteenth century this\r\nvalley became the battle ground of the great feud between the Sioux\r\nand Chippewa Indians, which lasted nearly one hundred and fifty years.\r\nMuch interesting material on this subject may be found in _Minnesota\r\nHistorical Collections_, volume five, which is a history of the\r\nChippewa tribe by a half-breed, W. W. Warren.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1766, three years after the French had ceded all this\r\nterritory to the British crown, the noted explorer, Jonathan Carver,\r\nascended the Mississippi and attempted to bring about a peace between\r\nthe warring Sioux and Chippewa. The next year he returned from\r\nMackinac, and with a stock of goods ascended the Chippewa River, at\r\nwhose headwaters he found a Chippewa village of one hundred fine stout\r\nwarriors. Their customs, however, were very filthy. This is, so far as\r\nwe know, the first recorded voyage through the Chippewa valley. No\r\ndoubt, however, many fur traders had preceded Carver, for he speaks of\r\nengaging a pilot to accompany him.\r\n\r\nIn the last years of the French régime there was reported a copper\r\nmine on this river, which was then called for a time “Bon Secours” or\r\nGood Help River. Carver calls it the Chippewa River. About six years\r\nafter Carver’s visit a British trader named Hugh Boyle was killed at\r\nthis river. See _Wisconsin Historical Collections_, XVIII, 312-13.\r\nAccording to the court of inquiry ordered by the British officials,\r\nthe affair was his own fault.\r\n\r\nThe British traders continued to trade on this river, notwithstanding\r\nthe danger caused by the fierce intertribal wars. In 1805 the United\r\nStates government sent Zebulon M. Pike, a young army lieutenant, to\r\nascend the Mississippi and warn British traders that this was then\r\nAmerican territory. It became so by the treaty of 1783, but the\r\nBritish kept the forts on the Great Lakes until 1796, and all had\r\ncontinued to act until Pike’s visit as if the upper Mississippi region\r\nbelonged to the British. Pike found that the traders avoided the\r\nChippewa River because of the danger of falling in with war parties of\r\ncontesting Indians. He passed the river’s mouth about dusk.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 an American expedition headed by Lewis Cass descended the\r\nMississippi, and from that time on there were numerous boats going up\r\nand down. The first steamboat ascended to the Falls of St. Anthony in\r\n1823. Some very early logging expeditions in 1822 and 1829 are\r\ndescribed in the _Wisconsin Historical Collections_, II, 132-41, and\r\nV, 244-54.\r\n\r\nThe earliest permanent settlers were the Cadottes. See _Wisconsin\r\nHistorical Collections_, XIX, 171, and _Minnesota Historical\r\nCollections_, volume five.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE CAREER OF COLONEL G. W. MANYPENNY\r\n\r\n     Can you give me any reference to any publication or record\r\n     in your library relating to G. W. Manypenny, who was Indian\r\n     commissioner in 1855 and in that year made a treaty with the\r\n     Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin?\r\n\r\n                                       E. S. GAYLORD,\r\n                                  _Minneapolis, Minnesota_.\r\n\r\nColonel George W. Manypenny, who was Indian commissioner in President\r\nPierce’s administration, was not a Wisconsin man. He was born in\r\nPennsylvania, and appointed from Ohio. His home was in Columbus, Ohio,\r\nand as early as 1835 he was editor of a prominent Democratic paper at\r\nthat place. His appointment was no doubt a reward for journalistic\r\nservices during the campaign; but he seems to have taken his duties\r\nseriously and to have undertaken the rôle of a defender of the red men\r\nagainst the extortions of unscrupulous speculators. In doing this he\r\nincurred the enmity of a powerful political clique among whom was\r\nSenator Benton.\r\n\r\nManypenny went west in August, 1853, and made the series of treaties\r\nthat opened up the territories of Kansas and Nebraska for settlement.\r\nIt is claimed that he acted in the interests of the South with regard\r\nto the Pacific railroad. See Wisconsin Historical Society\r\n_Proceedings_, 1912, 80. In 1855 Manypenny made the treaty with the\r\nMississippi bands of Chippewa at Washington, whither their chiefs had\r\nbeen conducted by Henry M. Rice.\r\n\r\nManypenny retired from office in March, 1857, and returned to Columbus\r\nwhere, in 1859, he purchased a half interest in the _Ohio Statesman_\r\nand was its editor for three years. In 1862 he retired to become\r\nmanager of the state public works, of which he was one of the lessees.\r\nHis interest in the Indians continued, and in 1876 he was appointed a\r\nchairman of the commission to investigate the troubles that had led to\r\nthe Sioux outbreak of that year. In 1880 he published a book entitled\r\n_Our Indian Wards_ (Cincinnati, Robert Clark & Co.), which is a plea\r\nfor more fairness in the management of Indian affairs, and a recital\r\nof many of their wrongs.\r\n\r\nThe date of his death we have not ascertained, nor whether he left\r\ndescendants. An inquiry of E. W. Randall, secretary of the Ohio\r\nArchaeological and Historical Society, at Columbus, would doubtless\r\nput you in possession of these facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n     TREATY HALL AND OLD LA POINTE\r\n\r\n     Will you kindly advise me what “Treaty Hall,” La Pointe,\r\n     Madeline Island, stands for historically? When and by whom\r\n     was it built? Some say it was erected in 1836 and others say\r\n     1857 or 1858. The treaties were signed before the latter\r\n     date, so why call it “Treaty Hall”? Any information you can\r\n     give on the subject will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n                         MRS. FRANK H. JERRARD,\r\n                 Representative St. Paul Chapter, D. A. R.,\r\n                                          _St. Paul, Minnesota_.\r\n\r\nThe information we have obtained concerning the building on Madeline\r\nIsland now called “Treaty Hall” does not give conclusive proof of the\r\norigin of the building. One fact seems clear--the name “Treaty Hall”\r\nwas not applied to it until the eighties of the last century, and the\r\nbuilding was not put up to accommodate the negotiating of a treaty.\r\nWhether a treaty was negotiated in this building or not is another\r\nquestion. As a rule Indian treaty proceedings were held in the open\r\nair; if any covering was desired, a kind of shade was built of boughs,\r\nor a circle was temporarily enclosed with poles, boughs, and mats.\r\nNevertheless it is not improbable that in the northern region of\r\nMadeline Island, with the cold winds from the lake blowing in, a\r\ntreaty might have been held under shelter, and that some appropriate\r\nbuilding might have been thus used.\r\n\r\nThere were only two treaties held on Madeline Island, that of 1842 and\r\nthat of 1854. The former was concluded October 4, 1842, and the\r\ncommissioner was Robert Stuart, who had been for many years the\r\nrepresentative of the American Fur Company at Mackinac. He was at the\r\ntime of this treaty Indian superintendent at Detroit. The inference is\r\nstrong that Stuart was on terms of friendship, even intimacy, with the\r\nAmerican Fur Company’s agents at La Pointe. These were at the time of\r\nthe treaty of 1842 Charles H. Oakes and Dr. Charles W. Borup, both of\r\nwhom were present at the treaty. Moreover, Rev. Alfred Brunson of\r\nPrairie du Chien, a prominent Methodist missionary in early-day\r\nWisconsin, was appointed Indian agent at La Pointe in the autumn of\r\n1842. He reached his post of duty very late in the year and says both\r\nin his printed reminiscences and in unpublished manuscripts in our\r\nSociety’s possession that there were no agency buildings, but that Dr.\r\nBorup had a large storehouse prepared for a council.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Treaty of 1854, it was signed September 30 of that\r\nyear. The commissioners were Henry C. Gilbert and Daniel B. Herriman.\r\nAmong the witnesses was L. H. Wheeler, whose sons are among our\r\ncorrespondents. H. M. Rice was likewise present. We believe the\r\nMinnesota Historical Society is in possession of the latter’s papers.\r\nIf so, something might be gleaned from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE LIGHT ON THE ORIGINATOR OF “WINNEQUAH”\r\n\r\nAs a medieval Madisonian, I protest against your summary termination\r\nof the activities of “Cap” Barnes at “1873 or 1874, perhaps\r\nlater.”[127] He was positively an institution in and of Madison, and I\r\npositively remember him and his steamboat line at least as late as\r\n1889. His steamboats, the _Scutenaubequon_ and the _Waubishnepawau_,\r\nlent new terrors to the aboriginal tongues. His later divergence to\r\n_Silenzioso_ bore witness to the liveliness, if not the expertness, of\r\nhis linguistic imagination. No Madisonian of the Victorian age, so to\r\nspeak, will recall “Angleworm Station” without a warming of the heart\r\nto the memory of “Cap” Barnes. His midwinter straw hat and his\r\nirrepressible gaiety are intimately associated with our tenderest\r\nMadison memories. Picnics? Madison was the home of them, and “Cap”\r\nBarnes and his steamboat, in combination, were preëssential to them.\r\nIt was “Cap” Barnes who hit upon the first discovered practical use of\r\nthe abortive capitol park driven well: “Pull it up, saw it into\r\nlengths, and sell it to the farmers for post holes.”\r\n\r\nStatesmen, prophets, and nabobs, Mr. Editor, may pass into\r\noblivion--but touch reverently on the memory of “Cap” Barnes. Madison\r\nwould never have been the Madison of its golden age without him.\r\n\r\n                                         CHARLES M. MORRIS.\r\nMilwaukee, January 7, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HISTORY OF OUR STATE FLAG\r\n\r\nI have just received the first copy of the new WISCONSIN MAGAZINE OF\r\nHISTORY, and think it a splendid idea. Of course, I have not had time\r\nto examine it carefully, but I did run across the short article with\r\nreference to the state flag, which seems rather to carry the idea that\r\nWisconsin had no state flag at any time prior to 1913.\r\n\r\nI call your attention to a letter written by me to H. W. Rood,\r\nCustodian of Memorial Hall, under date of January 5, 1911, in which I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     In response to your verbal request of a few days since, I\r\n     have investigated the matter of the state flag of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n     Chapter 215 of the Laws of 1863, published April 10th 1863,\r\n     provided in part as follows:\r\n\r\n     “Whenever the state flags of the regiments in the service of\r\n     the United States, from this state, shall have become so far\r\n     worn and damaged by service that it is deemed necessary to\r\n     replace them, and the officers commanding any of the said\r\n     regiments shall inform the governor of such fact, and make\r\n     requisition for new flags, the governor is hereby authorized\r\n     to cause to be furnished to such regiments new flags; the\r\n     state flag to be of the design, plan and material as adopted\r\n     by this legislature, by joint resolution No. 44, Senate; and\r\n     one of the said flags shall be inscribed with the names of\r\n     the battles in which such regiments shall have taken an\r\n     honorable part.”\r\n\r\n     I do not find that there was a joint resolution No. 44 of\r\n     that year. Resolution No. 4, however, is evidently the one\r\n     referred to and that provides as follows:\r\n\r\n     “Resolved, by the senate, the assembly concurring, that the\r\n     following be and is hereby adopted as the design for a state\r\n     flag for the state of Wisconsin:\r\n\r\n     “State Flag.--To be of dark blue silk, with the arms of the\r\n     State of Wisconsin painted or embroidered in silk on the\r\n     obverse side, and the arms of the United States, as\r\n     prescribed in paragraph 1435 of ‘new army regulations,’\r\n     painted or embroidered in silk on the reverse side; the name\r\n     of the regiment, when used as a regimental flag, to be in a\r\n     scroll beneath the state arms.\r\n\r\n     “The size of the regiment colors to be six feet, six inches\r\n     fly, and six feet deep on the pike; the length of pike for\r\n     said colors, including spear and ferrule, to be nine feet,\r\n     ten inches; the fringe yellow, cords and tassels blue and\r\n     white silk intermixed.”\r\n\r\n     This resolution was approved March 25, 1863.\r\n\r\n     Chapter 248 of the laws of 1864, published April 15, 1864,\r\n     repealed chapter 215 of the laws of 1863, but provided in\r\n     part as follows:\r\n\r\n     “The state flag to be of the design, plan and material as\r\n     adopted by the legislature of this state by joint resolution\r\n     No. 44, senate, at the session of 1863, and one of said\r\n     flags shall be inscribed with the names of the battles in\r\n     which such regiment or battery shall have taken an honorable\r\n     part.”\r\n\r\n     Joint Resolution No. 6, approved March 3, 1863, read as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n     “Resolved, that the superintendent of public property be and\r\n     he is hereby authorized to purchase two national flags and\r\n     two state flags, one each of which he shall place over the\r\n     president’s chair in the senate chamber, and one each over\r\n     the speaker’s chair in the assembly chamber, where they\r\n     shall remain during each session of the legislature.”\r\n\r\n     I do not find any other laws or resolutions relating to this\r\n     flag until the adoption of the revised statutes of 1878,\r\n     section 4978 of which provides in part that\r\n\r\n     “The following acts of the legislature, passed in the\r\n     several years hereinafter enumerated, shall be repealed,\r\n     that is to say:”\r\n\r\n     Then follows a table of the laws thus repealed and among\r\n     them I find chapter 248 of the laws of 1864. I believe that\r\n     this ends the legislation in relation to a state flag and\r\n     that the State of Wisconsin no longer has such a flag.\r\n\r\n     In the pamphlet published by Doctor Thwaites entitled\r\n     _Wisconsin’s Emblems and Sobriquet_ he refers to chapter 167\r\n     of the laws of Wisconsin of 1907 (section 633m of the\r\n     Wisconsin statutes), which provides:\r\n\r\n     “The organization, armament and discipline of the Wisconsin\r\n     national guard shall be the same as that which is now, or\r\n     may hereafter be prescribed for the regular and volunteer\r\n     armies of the United States.”\r\n\r\nHe seems to think that the state flag is now as provided in paragraph\r\n222 of the United States army regulations for 1904--the colors to be\r\nof silk, five feet, six inches fly, and four feet, four inches on the\r\npike, which shall be nine feet long, including spear head and ferrule.\r\nFrom this article I should assume that he considers that chapter 167\r\nof the laws of 1907 is the law that repealed the prior law providing\r\nfor a state flag. As will be seen from the references herein given,\r\nthis law was repealed upon the adoption of the revised statutes of\r\n1878.\r\n\r\nThis may not be of any particular importance, except that as a matter\r\nof historical accuracy, it should be noted that Wisconsin, in fact,\r\ndid for several years have a State Flag.\r\n\r\n                                         Very truly yours,\r\n                                        WINFIELD W. GILMAN.\r\nMadison, October 24, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [127] See WISCONSIN MAGAZINE OF HISTORY for December, 1917,\r\n     196.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURVEY OF HISTORICAL ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIETY AND THE STATE\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter ending December 31, 1917, five new life and\r\ntwenty-four annual members were added to the State Historical Society.\r\nThe new life members are: Henry F. De Puy, of New York City; Walter S.\r\nLacher, of La Grange, Illinois; Thomas E. Lyons, of Madison; Chester\r\nH. Thordarson, of Chicago; and J. Russell Wheeler, of Columbus,\r\nWisconsin. The list of new annual members is as follows: Rev. A. S.\r\nBadger, Waukesha; George Banta, Menasha; George Banta, Jr., Menasha;\r\nDr. Robert C. Brown, Milwaukee; Arthur J. Dopp, Waukesha; Emerson Ela,\r\nMadison; Judge Oscar M. Fritz, Milwaukee; Professor J. L. Gillen,\r\nMadison; L. H. Gingles, Waukesha; George Bird Grinnell, New York City;\r\nWilliam G. Hanson, Milwaukee; George C. Holmes, Madison; John T.\r\nKenney, Madison; Professor A. C. Kingsford, Baraboo; Gilbert L.\r\nLacher, Chicago; Judge David W. Maloney, Ladysmith; Dean Lois K.\r\nMathews, Madison; Carl E. Nord, Sioux City; Cyril A. Peerenboom,\r\nAppleton; A. L. Saltzstein, Milwaukee; Judge James E. Thomas,\r\nWaukesha; Frank J. Wilder, Boston; Edwin E. Witte, Madison; and Henry\r\nM. Youmans, Waukesha.\r\n\r\nDr. James W. Vance of Madison died October 31, 1917. Dr. Vance had\r\nbeen a member of the State Historical Society for thirty years. Mr.\r\nWalter P. Bishop, vice president of the E. P. Bacon Company of\r\nMilwaukee and since 1909 a member of the State Historical Society,\r\ndied October 10, 1917. Mr. Michael A. Hurley of Wausau, a member of\r\nthe Society since 1906, died September 25, 1917. Mr. Archie E. Wood,\r\nof Whitehall, died October 8, 1917.\r\n\r\nRev. Eugene G. Updike, of Madison, whose completion of a\r\ntwenty-seven-year pastorate of the First Congregational Church was\r\nnoted in a recent number of this magazine, died at the Madison General\r\nHospital December 24, 1917. Dr. Updike was a life member of the State\r\nHistorical Society, and throughout his long pastorate at Madison had\r\ntaken an active part in civic and educational affairs generally.\r\n\r\nHon. Thomas E. Nash, of Grand Rapids, for sixteen years a life member\r\nof the State Historical Society, died at his home December 13, 1917.\r\nMr. Nash was brought to Wisconsin in infancy by his parents. He had\r\nbeen engaged in railroad work for many years when in 1882 he was\r\nappointed by Postmaster General Vilas chief clerk of the post office\r\ndepartment and the following year general superintendent of the\r\nrailway mail service. In 1888 Mr. Nash organized the Nekoosa Pulp and\r\nPaper Company with which he continued to be prominently associated\r\nuntil ill health forced his retirement from active work a few years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nVolume XXIV of the Society’s _Collections_, entitled _Frontier Retreat\r\non the Upper Ohio, 1779-1781_, copy for which was sent to the state\r\nprinter in December, 1916, at length came from the press in December,\r\n1917, and was distributed the first of the year to the Society’s\r\nmembers and exchanges. The reading of galley proof on Volume XXV of\r\nthe _Collections_ was completed early in December. The contents of\r\nthis volume, entitled _An English Settler in Pioneer Wisconsin: the\r\nLetters of Edwin Bottomley, 1842-1850_, differ markedly from those of\r\nany preceding volume of the _Collections_. The papers printed present\r\na rarely intimate picture of the life and problems of the pioneer\r\nWisconsin farmer and constitute, it is believed, a valuable\r\ncontribution of source material to the history of the territorial\r\nperiod of Wisconsin’s development.\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of the WISCONSIN MAGAZINE OF HISTORY it is no\r\nlonger necessary, as it has been for upwards of a generation, to print\r\nhistorical contributions and discussions in the annual volume known as\r\nthe _Proceedings_ of the Society. Shorn of this supplementary\r\nhistorical matter, the official report of the activities of the\r\nSociety and its auxiliaries for 1917 shrinks to a document of less\r\nthan 100 pages. Copy for this was sent to the state printer in\r\nJanuary. Should the MAGAZINE prove, on sufficient trial, to justify\r\nthe continuance of its existence, the scope and character of the\r\ncontents of the _Proceedings_ for 1917 will set the standard,\r\npresumably, for the issues of succeeding years.\r\n\r\nA brief statement concerning four important editorial enterprises now\r\nbeing prosecuted may be in order. Work on the series of volumes\r\ndesigned to constitute a documentary history of Wisconsin’s\r\nconstitution, which has been prosecuted intermittently by the\r\nSuperintendent for the past two years, has now reached a stage where\r\nit seems likely that copy for one volume can be sent to the printer\r\nbefore the close of the Society’s present fiscal year. Probably four\r\nvolumes will be requisite to complete the series. After the editing of\r\nthe first one shall have been completed, the remaining ones may be\r\nexpected to follow in fairly rapid order. Work on the second volume of\r\nthe Draper Calendar series, mention of which was made in the MAGAZINE\r\nfor September, 1917, has progressed haltingly, due to the war-time\r\ndisruption of the office staff. It now seems safe to predict that the\r\ncopy will be ready for the printer by the end of the month. The other\r\nenterprises alluded to were both initiated in the autumn of 1917. Dr.\r\nKellogg began work at that time on the preparation of a volume of\r\nsource material pertaining to the Indian treaties and land cessions\r\nwhich are of more particular interest to Wisconsin. This project has\r\nlong been in mind, but its execution was necessarily deferred until\r\nthe search for documents in the Indian Office Files, begun three years\r\nago, should be completed. Dr. Oliver began in September the editing of\r\na volume of source material in the Society’s manuscript collection\r\npertaining to Wisconsin’s activities in the Civil War. With this\r\nvolume will be initiated a Civil War series of the _Collections_ which\r\nwill in time, it is hoped, run to many volumes.\r\n\r\nA note may be inserted here concerning three items of lesser scope and\r\nimportance than the foregoing, all of them bibliographical in\r\ncharacter. A trenchant and thoroughgoing report on the state archives\r\nsituation in Wisconsin, prepared for the Society by Mr. Theodore\r\nBlegen in the summer of 1917, was sent to the printer early in the\r\nwinter. Copy for a supplementary checklist of the collection of\r\nnewspapers in the Historical Library to list the accessions from the\r\ntime of publication in 1911 of the Society’s monumental _Annotated\r\nCatalogue of Newspaper Files_ down to January 1, 1918, has been under\r\npreparation for more than a year. It has at length been sent to the\r\nprinter, and will appear in due time as one of the Society’s\r\n_Bulletins of Information_. Taken in conjunction with the _Annotated\r\nCatalogue_, this bulletin will afford a complete index to the\r\nSociety’s splendid collection of newspapers, the second largest, it is\r\nbelieved, in America. It is hoped that in the future, annual\r\nsupplements of the previous year’s accumulations may be issued in\r\nconnection with the annual checklist of _Periodicals and Newspapers\r\nCurrently Received_ by the Library. In February, 1917, the Society\r\nbegan the publication of a monthly _Checklist of Wisconsin Public\r\nDocuments_ the contents of each number pertaining to the state\r\ndocuments issued during the preceding month. This publication has\r\nproved of much usefulness, apparently, and is in widespread demand by\r\nlibrarians, students of the social sciences, and governmental\r\ndepartments. A cumulative checklist of all state documents issued\r\nduring the year 1917 has been prepared and will be issued as soon as\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\nThe project for the initial volume of the Society’s Hollister\r\nPharmaceutical Series, made possible by the bequest of the late\r\nColonel and Mrs. Hollister of Madison, has at length assumed definite\r\nand, it is believed, interesting form. According to the original plan,\r\nDr. Edward Kremers of the University Pharmacy Department undertook to\r\ntranslate and edit for the Society Pierre Jartu’s notable treatise on\r\nthe ginseng plant. In the course of the work this project has\r\ngradually enlarged until now, with the coöperation of Dr. Richtmann,\r\nit is proposed to prepare a comprehensive treatise of the several\r\naspects, pharmaceutical, commercial, and otherwise, of the history of\r\nginseng. Such a volume should worthily initiate this unique scientific\r\nseries for which the Society has long been planning.\r\n\r\nColonel John Hicks of Oshkosh, publisher of the _Daily Northwestern_\r\nand one of the best known newspaper men in Wisconsin, died suddenly at\r\nSan Antonio, Texas, December 20, 1917. Colonel Hicks was much\r\ninterested in Wisconsin history, in the making of which he had been\r\nfor fifty years an active participant. At the time of his death, he\r\nwas engaged in writing his reminiscences for publication in the\r\n_Northwestern_, and within a few days of his demise had taken up with\r\nthe State Historical Society the question of possible publication by\r\nit of his reminiscences in book form. As a result of Colonel Hick’s\r\npublic beneficence, statues of Chief Oshkosh and of Carl Schurz adorn\r\nhis home city, while in several of the public schools are bronze busts\r\nof prominent Americans for whom the buildings are severally named.\r\n\r\nMr. William H. Ellsworth of Milwaukee, one of Wisconsin’s best known\r\narcheological collectors, died November 6, 1917. At the time of his\r\ndeath Mr. Ellsworth was vice president of the Wisconsin Archeological\r\nSociety. To the work of that institution he had devoted a large part\r\nof his time and means. Valuable archeological collections made by him\r\nare found in the museums of Beloit College, in the Minnesota\r\nHistorical Society, and in the Milwaukee Public Museum.\r\n\r\nJohn F. Appleby, inventor of the Appleby twine binder, died at his\r\nhome in Chicago, November 8, 1917. Mr. Appleby was one of the notable\r\nWisconsin inventors who have contributed materially to the scientific\r\nand economic development of the country. During the decade of the\r\nfifties, when the great West was unfolding its agricultural riches,\r\nthe farmers suddenly realized that the only limitation upon the amount\r\nof their wheat acreage was their ability to harvest the crop. The\r\nMcCormick reaper had already made its appearance, but it served only\r\nto cut the grain, leaving it lying loose upon the ground to be bound\r\nby hand. Some device for holding the grain and binding it into sheaves\r\nwas essential before the wheat acreage of the West could be materially\r\nincreased. After years of experimentation in a little shop in Beloit,\r\nAppleby announced the construction of a mechanical twine binder. The\r\noriginal model of his invention, which is substantially identical with\r\nthe device now in use on scores of thousands of farms in America and\r\nabroad, may be seen in the museum of the State Historical Society at\r\nMadison.\r\n\r\nMr. Christian Abrahamson, of Chicago, has recently painted a portrait\r\nof former Supreme Court Judge J. E. Dodge, of Milwaukee, for\r\npresentation to the State Historical Society. A replica of the\r\nportrait has also been prepared for the Supreme Court room in the\r\nCapitol.\r\n\r\nMr. C. E. Freeman, of Menomonie, Wisconsin, has presented to the\r\nSociety an interesting document pertaining to the railroad\r\nfarm-mortgage projects of the fifties in Wisconsin. Readers of Mr.\r\nMerk’s _Economic History of Wisconsin During the Civil War Decade_,\r\npublished by the Society last year, need not be told how important was\r\nthe rôle played by the railroad farm mortgage in the economic and\r\npolitical annals of early Wisconsin. The document presented by Mr.\r\nFreeman is a contract between the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad and\r\na farmer, whereby the railroad company agrees to cancel the interest\r\non the individual’s farm mortgage in return for the relinquishment by\r\nthe latter of his prospective dividends on his railroad stock. This\r\nwas a central feature of the farm mortgage scheme, yet at the time of\r\nwriting his _Economic History_, Mr. Merk was unable to uncover any\r\ndirect documentary evidence concerning it. This hiatus in the\r\nSociety’s collection of historical material pertaining to the subject\r\nof railroad farm mortgages is now filled by the gift of Mr. Freeman.\r\n\r\nA fine bronze bas relief of Mary Elizabeth Mears, better known,\r\nperhaps, by her pen name, Nellie Wildwood, has been received by the\r\nSociety from her daughter in New York. The bas relief is the work of\r\nanother daughter of Mrs. Mears, Helen Farnsworth Mears, who was for\r\nmany years prior to her death in 1916 one of Wisconsin’s most notable\r\nartists. The “Recollections” of Mrs. Mears were published in the\r\n_Proceedings_ of the Society for 1916. The Madison Art Association has\r\nsecured for hanging in the State Historical Museum a copy of Miss\r\nMears’s Augustus St. Gaudens.\r\n\r\nColonel Michael Frank, “father of the free public school system of\r\nWisconsin,” was born in New York in 1804 and died in Kenosha in 1895.\r\nHe came to Southport (now Kenosha) to reside in October, 1839. Three\r\nmonths later, on January 1, 1840, he began keeping a diary. Upon its\r\nconclusion, December 31, 1890, this work had continued half a century\r\nand filled thirty-nine bound manuscript volumes. Throughout this\r\nhalf-century Colonel Frank figured as one of the prominently useful\r\ncitizens of the territory and state. His voluminous diary has now come\r\nto the State Historical Society from its possessor, Mr. F. H. Lyman,\r\nof Kenosha, an old neighbor and friend of Colonel Frank. The diary is\r\nwell preserved and written in an excellent hand. Although only a\r\ncursory examination has as yet been made of its contents, it seems\r\nevident that the work will prove a valuable aid to students interested\r\nin this period of Wisconsin’s history.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MARY ELIZABETH MEARS\r\n   From a bas relief owned by the Wisconsin Historical Society]\r\n\r\nA collection of papers of Governor Nelson Dewey, consisting\r\nprincipally of a business account book and several annual volumes of\r\nhis diary, has been presented to the Society by Mr. R. A. Watkins of\r\nLancaster. The diary of Governor Dewey seems to have been widely\r\nscattered. Some volumes of it have long been in the Historical\r\nLibrary, and several more are in the possession of a resident of\r\nCassville.\r\n\r\nSeveral interesting additions of noncurrent newspaper files were made\r\nto the Library during the quarter ending December 31, 1917. Most\r\ninteresting locally, perhaps, is a file of _Lucifer_, 1884-98, in\r\nfifteen bound volumes. Publication of _Lucifer_ was begun at Madison\r\nin 1882; later it was continued at Milwaukee until the demise of the\r\npaper in 1898. Published in German, it was the organ of the Turner\r\nsocieties, and manifested a liberal and anti-Catholic viewpoint. To\r\nthe Society’s slowly-growing file of photostatic copies of the _Boston\r\nNews Letter_ all known existing issues for the years 1726-29,\r\ninclusive, were acquired during the quarter. Other files of\r\nMassachusetts papers acquired are the Newburyport _Evening Union_\r\n(daily), January 1-September 18, 1851, and _Russell’s Gazette_\r\n(Boston, semi-weekly), January-July, 1800. Finally, two Ohio papers\r\nwere added: the Cleveland _Recorder_, 1896-97, and July-December,\r\n1899, in four volumes, and the Cincinnati _Graphic_, August,\r\n1885-November, 1886, in two volumes.\r\n\r\nFrom Captain George Jackson of Chicago the Society has received a rare\r\nvolume possessed of much sentimental interest. It is “Dr. Mort.\r\nLuther’s _Lesser Catechism_,” published in New York in 1842. But one\r\nother copy of the book is known to be in existence and this is in\r\nprivate hands. The _Lesser Catechism_ was the first book in the\r\nNorwegian language to be printed in America.\r\n\r\nA scrapbook filled with clippings concerning the Kansas troubles and\r\nthe Civil War has been presented to the State Historical Society by\r\nLouis W. Bridgman, son of Edward Bridgman, who died in Madison in\r\nAugust, 1915. Mr. Bridgman migrated to “Bleeding Kansas” from\r\nMassachusetts in the spring of 1856. Staking out a claim near\r\nOsawatomie, he soon took up living quarters with the brother of Susan\r\nB. Anthony, who was also a Massachusetts crusader in the cause of\r\nfreedom. To their cabin one evening late in August, 1856, came John\r\nBrown with his band of tired followers. Here they spent the night and\r\nwere having breakfast the next morning, when news arrived of the\r\nimpending attack upon Osawatomie by a large band of proslavery\r\nMissourians. Leaving the unfinished meal, Brown and his men started to\r\nmeet the invaders. Bridgman and Anthony followed as soon as they could\r\npull their cooking utensils from the open fire. Thus Bridgman\r\nparticipated in Osawatomie, John Brown’s most notable battle, and\r\nlived to become probably the last survivor of Brown’s band of\r\nfollowers on that day.\r\n\r\nA few years later, having returned to Massachusetts, he enlisted in\r\nthe Thirty-seventh Infantry in which he served during the Civil War. A\r\nschool teacher by profession, he wrote frequent letters to the press,\r\nboth during his Civil War career and in later years, describing his\r\nexperiences, and retailing his recollections. The scrapbook now\r\npresented by his son, and largely made up of such clippings,\r\nconstitutes a valuable contribution to the Society’s collection of\r\nCivil War material.\r\n\r\nThe September number of the MAGAZINE contained an account of the gift\r\nto the state of Perrot State Park, including in its limits Trempealeau\r\nMountain and the site of Perrot’s “fort” or wintering place of 1689.\r\nIt is gratifying to be able to record the gift at Christmas time of\r\nanother splendid park site to the state. Mr. Martin Pattison of\r\nSuperior is the donor whose enlightened generosity makes possible the\r\npreservation for public use and enjoyment of the Manitou Falls of\r\nBlack River, some fifteen miles out of Superior. Mr. Pattison has been\r\nquietly at work for several years securing the title to some 600 acres\r\nof woodland around the falls, “Douglas County’s most cherished beauty\r\nspot,” in order to make this public disposition of it. Thus another\r\nbit of historic Wisconsin scenery gives promise of being permanently\r\npreserved in its virgin state for the enjoyment of future generations\r\nof Wisconsin citizens.\r\n\r\nDuring the holiday season the State Historical Museum had on exhibit a\r\nsmall Christmas tree, decorated with patriotic emblems of all the\r\nallied countries. Diminutive flags representing the national colors,\r\nRed Cross flags, food conservation buttons, a miniature Red Cross\r\nservice flag, tiny bundles of liberty bonds, diminutive airplanes, and\r\nmachine guns were all displayed. Small gilt discs, representing each\r\nof the camps in which Wisconsin boys are training, were also\r\ndisplayed. All of the decorations were arranged so as to embody the\r\nred, white, and blue color scheme.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles E. Graves, formerly exchange librarian of the University\r\nof Illinois, became librarian of the Minnesota Historical Society at\r\nSt. Paul, November 1, 1917.\r\n\r\nDuring the closing months of 1917 the Minnesota Historical Society\r\nmoved into its splendid new home which has been in the process of\r\nerection during the last two years. As the historical development of\r\nWisconsin and of Minnesota has much in common, it is but natural that\r\nthe relations between the historical societies of the two states\r\nshould be cordial and intimate. That the further career of the\r\nMinnesota Historical Society shall be such that before many years the\r\nnew home will prove to be as inadequate as the old one has long been,\r\nis the best wish we, in behalf of the State Historical Society of\r\nWisconsin, can extend to it at this season of congratulation.\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Historical Commission is actively engaged in a campaign\r\nto save the important state documents and archives of the\r\ncommonwealth. Recently the original copy of the first Michigan\r\nconstitution (1835) was found in the state capitol hidden away in an\r\nold tin can, where it had been placed many years ago. The ends of the\r\ndocument were so badly mutilated that the names of some of the signers\r\ncould no longer be read. Appropriate treatment to insure against\r\nfurther deterioration of this priceless manuscript was applied, and it\r\nis now suitably housed in the capitol building. The preliminary step\r\nlooking to the establishment of an archival department for Michigan\r\nhas already been taken by the historical commission. Messrs. F. B.\r\nStreeter and J. H. Russell have been engaged to collect, arrange, and\r\nclassify the archives of the state, and have already entered upon this\r\nimportant work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME WISCONSIN PUBLIC DOCUMENTS AUGUST-DECEMBER, 1917\r\n\r\nIn a bulletin published by the Wisconsin Highway Commission in\r\nSeptember, 1917, on the state trunk highway law, the announcement is\r\nmade that there is available from the federal government $128,361.07.\r\nDuring the next four years it is estimated there will be a total of\r\n$1,925,416.05 available for road construction in Wisconsin. The\r\nfederal law provides that a state, in order to receive this\r\nappropriation, must set aside each year an amount at least equal to\r\nthat provided by the national government. The money thus derived may\r\nbe expended upon any public road over which the United States mails\r\nare now or may hereafter be transported. The State Highway Commission\r\npredicts that by the close of the year 1918 Wisconsin will have a\r\nsystem of travelable roads connecting all county seats and all the\r\nprincipal centers of population in the state. Wisconsin is already one\r\nof the leading good-roads states in the country; under the operation\r\nof the new law this position of leadership should easily be retained.\r\n\r\nThe _Biennial Report_ of the State Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction, issued in September, 1917, indicates that the two years\r\njust closed have been the most fruitful and active in the entire\r\nhistory of public education in Wisconsin. The state educational staff\r\nhas been increased by the addition of a supervisor of manual training,\r\na supervisor of tests and measurements, an editorial and statistical\r\nsecretary, and an additional supervisor of city and village grades.\r\nThe report is particularly valuable in that it includes not only a\r\ncompilation of all the data dealing with the public schools, but also\r\na system of graphs, diagrams, and charts which set forth in striking\r\nmanner the educational facts of the state. By these illustrations the\r\nreader is able to see on a single page all the facts relating to any\r\none phase of education.\r\n\r\nA most suggestive pamphlet entitled _Illiteracy and Americanization_,\r\nprepared by Amy Bronsky, was issued from the office of the state\r\nsuperintendent of public instruction in October, 1917. The vital\r\nimportance of educating and Americanizing every person within our\r\nborders is well set forth. According to the census of 1910, Wisconsin\r\nhad 57,769 illiterates over ten years of age, and 120,665 non-English\r\nspeaking residents over ten years of age. Miss Bronsky adds that,\r\nnotwithstanding the efforts made to reduce this number, it is probable\r\nthat it has been growing larger rather than smaller since the year\r\n1910. Wisconsin’s percentage of illiteracy (3.2) is lower than that of\r\nthe country at large, but not so low as in two of our neighboring\r\nstates, Minnesota (3) and Iowa (1.7). By the establishment of the\r\ncontinuation schools, night sessions, reading circles, and other\r\nallied agencies, it is believed that the next decade will show a\r\nconsiderable decrease in the percentage of illiteracy.\r\n\r\nThe _Proceedings_ of the Wisconsin State Conference of Charities and\r\nCorrections for 1916 deal almost exclusively with the one problem of\r\nfeeble-mindedness. Never before has the importance of this subject\r\nbeen brought so strikingly to the attention of the social workers of\r\nWisconsin. The first report ever submitted dealing with these\r\nunfortunates in our midst was made at this conference. It reveals the\r\nfact, surprising to most people, that there are over 13,000 of them in\r\nthe state. Of this number only 5,000 can be accommodated in the\r\ninstitutions that are now provided. The imperative need of securing\r\nadditional facilities for their care and instruction was the chief\r\nproblem dealt with by the conference.\r\n\r\nThe 1917 _Annual Report_ of the State Horticultural Society shows that\r\nfield work is now being conducted at eleven different points\r\nthroughout the state. At Polar, Maple, Whitehall, Manitowoc, Sparta,\r\nBaraboo, Holcombe, Pewaukee, Gays Mills, Lake Geneva, and Weston\r\nexperiments are under way. The supervision of trial orchards at the\r\nstations constitutes the major part of the society’s activities, and\r\nabsorbs the larger portion of its funds. The trial orchard at Gays\r\nMills is regarded as the best of its age in the state.\r\n\r\nThat the reading-circle movement has made great progress in Wisconsin\r\nduring the last two years is shown by the report issued for 1917-1918,\r\nwhich reveals an increase of over 175 per cent in the number of\r\npersons who are doing work under the auspices of this organization. An\r\nincrease of more than 300 per cent in the number of boys and girls\r\nreading under the direction of the Young People’s Circles is reported.\r\nUpwards of 2,500 teachers and more than 24,000 pupils did the required\r\nreading in their respective circles during the last school year.\r\nFifty-four counties took part in the Young People’s Reading Circle,\r\nand fifty in the Teachers’ Circle. Of the cities that have taken the\r\nlead in the number of members enrolled in the Young People’s Circle,\r\nJanesville heads the list with 507. Marinette County leads in the\r\nnumber of seals and diplomas granted to teachers with a total of 158.\r\n\r\nThat the town mutual fire insurance companies in Wisconsin experienced\r\ntheir usual increase in business during the last year is seen from\r\ntheir _Forty-eighth Annual Report_ issued in 1917. The insurance in\r\nforce at the close of the business year in December, 1916, was\r\n$28,943,362 more than at the close of the preceding year. Practically\r\nthe entire agricultural interests of the state are protected by some\r\none of these mutual companies. The prediction is made that the\r\nterritory will remain about the same in the future as at the present.\r\nThe only change in business to be looked for will be the gradual\r\nincrease in the value of rural property and improved conditions making\r\nfor increased insurance. Only one new company has entered the\r\nfield--the North Wisconsin Finnish Farmers of Marengo.\r\n\r\nThe December (1917) number of the _Wisconsin Library Bulletin_\r\npresents what is practically a first report of the work done in this\r\nstate in raising funds for camp libraries. Wisconsin’s contribution to\r\nthe million dollar fund was approximately $41,000. Since our quota,\r\naccording to the basis of population, was slightly over $25,000, it\r\nwill be seen that the state not only did her share but greatly\r\nexceeded it.\r\n\r\nThe _Wisconsin State Board of Health Bulletin_ for September, 1917,\r\nreports that during the preceding three months 6,230 deaths occurred\r\nin the state. This corresponds to an annual death rate of 9.9 a\r\nthousand of the population. This record shows a decline of 422 in the\r\ntotal number of deaths when compared to the report for the same three\r\nmonths in 1916. It is interesting to note that during the three months\r\ncovered by this report--July, August, and September--the death rate in\r\nthe northern part of the state was only 8.6 a thousand, in the central\r\ncounties, 10 a thousand, and in the southern counties, 10.4 a\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nThe _Proceedings_ of the Fifty-first Annual Encampment of the\r\nDepartment of Wisconsin Grand Army of the Republic, 1917, shows that\r\nat the beginning of the year there were only 4,247 surviving members\r\nleft. The highest membership ever reached by the Wisconsin\r\norganization was in 1899 when there were 13,944 enrolled. Death\r\nclaimed 420 of the veterans during the year from December 31, 1915, to\r\nDecember 31, 1916.\r\n\r\nThe _Opinions of the Attorney-General of Wisconsin_ issued for\r\nOctober, 1917, shows that his advice was sought upon thirty-seven\r\ndifferent questions. The uncertainties attending the statutes relating\r\nto the construction of bridges and highways brought forth the largest\r\nnumber of inquiries. The duties of public officers, particularly\r\ncounty officials, and the interpretation of the fish and game laws\r\nalso required a large number of opinions to be handed down at that\r\ntime of the year.\r\n\r\nThe _Consolidated Annual Reports_ of the Wisconsin Dairyman’s\r\nAssociation for the annual meetings of 1913, 1914, 1915, and 1916 was\r\nissued in July, 1917. The report shows that since the organization of\r\nthe association in 1872, the dairy products of the state have\r\nincreased from $1,000,000 to over $120,000,000. Wisconsin now stands\r\nfirst among the states both in the value of dairy products and in the\r\nnumber of dairy cows. In July, 1917, there were 81 cow-testing\r\nassociations. The total membership was 2,417, while the number of cows\r\nunder test exceeded 38,000. The average cow in Wisconsin produces 175\r\npounds of fat a year, although there was one herd reported where the\r\naverage reached 564 pounds of fat.\r\n\r\n_Fuel Conservation by the Economical Combustion of Soft Coal_ by\r\nGustus Ludwig Larson is the title of Bulletin No. 888 of the\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin issued in December, 1917. The author declares\r\nthat many plants waste through unscientific firing and inadequate\r\nequipment as much as fifty per cent of the coal they buy. The criminal\r\nwaste in the burning of coal in which many firemen engage is regarded\r\nas the most serious problem facing our people during the winter\r\nseason. The question of proper combustion, both in the firing power\r\nplants and in domestic heating, and a discussion of the different\r\ndevices for burning soft coal without smoke are set forth in a\r\npractical manner by Professor Larson. A table showing the\r\ncharacteristic analyses of soft coal available to Wisconsin buyers is\r\nincluded in the bulletin.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\nProfessor F. A. Ogg of the University of Wisconsin, and a member of\r\nthe State Historical Society, is the author of a new volume entitled\r\n_National Progress, 1907 to 1917_. All students of American history\r\nare familiar with the monumental coöperative history of our country\r\nedited by Professor Hart of Harvard, entitled _The American Nation_.\r\nThis work in twenty-seven volumes was completed in 1907. Professor\r\nOgg’s new book is designed to bring the work down to date by covering\r\nthe history of the nation for the decade ending with 1917.\r\n\r\nThe recent volume by Dr. Kellogg, Research Associate in the State\r\nHistorical Society, entitled _Early Narratives of the Northwest\r\n1634-1699_, is reviewed in the _American Historical Review_ in part as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     “If the early history of Wisconsin and neighboring regions\r\n     is not adequately accessible to future generations, it will\r\n     be through no fault of a group of zealous and competent\r\n     students who, perhaps inspired by the examples of Draper,\r\n     the collector, and Thwaites, editor and collector, continue\r\n     the work in true historical spirit and scientific method. If\r\n     Wisconsin is fortunate in her students, she is also\r\n     abundantly rich in material for study. * * * For all of the\r\n     journals Miss Kellogg’s abundant annotation is helpful. We\r\n     wish she had added one more note, explaining Raddison’s\r\n     wonderful word _auxotacicae_ (p. 65). The clearly-penned\r\n     introduction to each narrative not merely summarizes it, but\r\n     informs the student of what printing it has already had,\r\n     either in French or English, and makes plain the editor’s\r\n     choice of text. Not the least interesting feature of the\r\n     work is a facsimile of a contemporary map drawn to\r\n     illustrate Marquette’s discoveries, here reproduced from the\r\n     original in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris. A portion of\r\n     Franquelin’s map of 1688 is also given. Few typographical\r\n     slips are noted; even La Salle (Cavelier), recorded in more\r\n     than one work as ‘Chevalier,’ gets through safely here, with\r\n     but one transformation into ‘Cavalier’ (p. 164).\r\n\r\n     “The volume as a whole bespeaks scholarly care and regard\r\n     for the needs of a large class of students to whom rare\r\n     volumes or obscure texts may not be available; and admirably\r\n     presents the essential original material of the first\r\n     half-century and more, from the first known advent of the\r\n     white man in the _pays d’en haut_.”\r\n\r\n_Wisconsin’s Social Democracy_ is a forty-six page pamphlet by Hon.\r\nFrederick W. von Cotzhausen, of Milwaukee, printed in advance from a\r\nprojected volume containing the author’s “Historic Reminiscences and\r\nReflections.” The pamphlet now issued consists of three parts written\r\nrespectively in 1906, 1914, and 1917, and aims at “Sketching a few\r\nEpisodes” in the history of Socialism in Wisconsin “which may be of\r\nfuture historical interest and of which I may speak from personal\r\nobservation.” The tone and sentiments of the author are strongly\r\nantisocialistic in character.\r\n\r\n_Henry Baird Favill, A.B., M.D., LL.D., 1860-1916_, is the title of a\r\nmemorial volume, privately printed, to this noted son of Wisconsin.\r\nWisconsin has produced many great physicians but of them all none has\r\nachieved worthier fame than did Doctor Favill. Born in Madison in\r\n1860, the capital city continued to be his home until 1894. He then\r\nremoved to Chicago where in a few years he gained recognition not only\r\nas one of the city’s leading physicians but also as one of the most\r\nindustrious civic workers and useful citizens. The memorial volume,\r\ncompiled by his son, contains two parts: one devoted to tributes and\r\nresolutions, the other to addresses and papers by Doctor Favill. The\r\nwide range of topics covered by the latter and the charm of style and\r\nbreadth of vision manifested in their treatment afford a glimpse, at\r\nleast, of the intellectual and human greatness of their author.\r\n\r\nTo the La Crosse _Tribune_ for November 4, 1917, E. S. Hebberd\r\ncontributes a proposal that the one-hundredth anniversary of the birth\r\nof Cadwalader C. Washburn, which occurs in 1918, be observed in\r\nfitting manner. The Washburn family is remarkable for the ability and\r\nthe public careers of its members. All of the seven brothers achieved\r\ndistinction. Four were members of Congress, each representing a\r\ndifferent state. Two were governors of their respective states, and\r\ntwo, including one of the congressmen, were ministers of the United\r\nStates to foreign countries. Wisconsin owes a debt of gratitude to C.\r\nC. Washburn, and it would seem fitting that appropriate recognition\r\nshould be made of the centennial of his birth.\r\n\r\n_The Wisconsin Archeologist_ for July, 1917, has as its leading\r\narticle a survey of Lake Shawano and the Wolf River, by George R. Fox\r\nand H. O. Younger. As a water route the Wolf River was long used by\r\nthe American Trading Company in reaching its trading stations in\r\nnorthern Wisconsin. The survey here presented constitutes a valuable\r\nhistorical and archeological discussion of this region. The October\r\nnumber is chiefly devoted to a survey of Chetek and Rice lakes written\r\nby Charles E. Brown and Robert Becker.\r\n\r\nCharles A. Eastman’s _From the Deep Woods to Civilization_, published\r\nby Little, Brown and Company, is a fascinating volume. The author, a\r\nfull-blooded Sioux, began life as a barbarian of the plains, his\r\nfamily having fled to Canada after the Sioux outbreak of 1862 in\r\nMinnesota. The present volume tells the story of his life from the\r\ntime when his father determined to dedicate him to a civilized career.\r\nIt is interesting to note that from an enthusiastic believer in the\r\nsuperiority of civilized life as compared with savagery, the author\r\nhas come gradually to doubt the correctness of his earlier view.\r\nApparently the present world cataclysm, which has swept many another\r\nthinker from his accustomed moorings, has had some influence upon Mr.\r\nEastman’s views concerning the respective merits of the civilized and\r\nthe savage states. Wisconsin readers of the book will take special\r\ninterest in the chapter “College Life in the West,” describing the\r\nauthor’s experiences at Beloit College, to which place the young\r\nneophyte in the arts of the paleface turned on leaving the Santee\r\nAgency Mission School.\r\n\r\n_Methodist Heroes of Other Days_ by Samuel Gardiner Ayer has been\r\nissued by the Methodist Book Concern. It is a slight volume containing\r\nsome thirty-six short appreciative sketches of as many “heroes” of the\r\nMethodist Episcopal denomination. Wisconsin readers will be\r\nparticularly interested in the short account of “Alfred Brunson, the\r\nSoldier Preacher,” one of the founders of the Methodist Episcopal\r\nchurch in Wisconsin. Readers of the MAGAZINE will be interested still\r\nfurther, perhaps, to learn that a daughter of Reverend Brunson is at\r\nthe present time engaged in writing a biography of her father for the\r\nState Historical Society.\r\n\r\nThe December, 1917, number of the _Mississippi Valley Historical\r\nReview_ maintains the high standard of excellence which readers have\r\nbeen led, by the character of previous numbers, to expect in this\r\nperiodical. The three leading articles are: “Howell Cobb and the\r\nCrisis of 1850,” by R. P. Brooks; “A Larger View of the Yellowstone\r\nExpedition, 1819-1820,” by Cardinal Goodwin; and “The Beginnings of\r\nBritish West Florida,” by C. E. Carter. Dan E. Clark contributes the\r\nannual review of historical activities in the trans-Mississippi\r\nNorthwest, and to complete the number are departments devoted to\r\n“Notes and Documents,” “Book Reviews,” and “Notes and Comments.”\r\n\r\nAnnouncement has recently been made of the resignation of Clarence W.\r\nAlvord as managing editor of the _Mississippi Valley Historical\r\nReview_, in which capacity he has acted since the founding of the\r\nmagazine in 1914. The _Review_, largely because of the efforts of Mr.\r\nAlvord, now ranks among the best of American historical publications.\r\nIts readers will greatly regret Mr. Alvord’s resignation.\r\n\r\nThe leading article in the October, 1917, issue of the _Iowa Journal\r\nof History and Politics_, describes the Iowa war loan of 1861. By\r\nreason in part of a doubtful provision in the state constitution, in\r\npart of the concerted efforts of the southern sympathizers living in\r\nIowa, the state administration encountered greater difficulty in\r\nfloating a war loan than was the case in any other northern state.\r\nThrough the columns of the distant _New York Herald_ the enemies of\r\nthe loan conducted their campaign to defeat it. The manner in which\r\nGovernor Kirkwood and his assistants overbore the opposition and saved\r\nthe reputation of the state is vividly described.\r\n\r\nThe life of Samuel J. Kirkwood, Iowa’s war governor, by D. E. Clark,\r\nhas been issued as one of the Biographical Series of the Iowa\r\nHistorical Society. The study of Governor Kirkwood’s life takes the\r\nreader into the history of three commonwealths, but it is with the\r\ndevelopment of Iowa that his name is inseparably associated. As Civil\r\nWar governor, United States senator, and secretary of the interior\r\nunder Garfield, his name is perhaps more widely known than that of any\r\nother person in Iowa history. In preparing the biography, Mr. Clark\r\nhad access to seven _Civil War Letter Books_ and three letter books\r\nfor the period when Kirkwood was secretary of the interior. Use was\r\nalso made of a large collection of letters, covering the period from\r\n1850-1890. From these sources the author has given us a sketch of\r\nIowa’s noted war governor which is both timely and valuable.\r\n\r\nIn a two-volume work on _Burrows of Michigan and the Republican Party_\r\npublished by Longman, Green and Company, 1917, William Dana Orcott has\r\npresented a detailed career of one of Michigan’s most famous men. As\r\nlawyer, college professor, military hero, and United States senator,\r\nBurrows gained an acquaintance that was nation wide. In ability he\r\nranked with Blaine, Garfield, Reed, and McKinley; and had he not been\r\nso blindly devoted to the partisan principles which he represented, in\r\nall probability he would have occupied a higher office.\r\n\r\nThe _Michigan Historical Magazine_ for October, 1917, contains an\r\ninteresting group of Civil War letters written by Hon. Washington\r\nGardiner while serving as a volunteer in 1863-64. The letters were all\r\nwritten from the front, and depict the conditions observed by this\r\nyouthful soldier of sixteen years.\r\n\r\nThose who enjoy reading a frontier narrative will welcome a little\r\nvolume recently published, entitled _A Soldier Doctor of our Army:\r\nJames P. Kimball_. The book was written by Maria B. Kimball, wife of\r\nDr. Kimball, and is published by the Houghton Mifflin Company. Dr.\r\nKimball served in the Civil War and later for a number of years at\r\nFort Buford and other places on the western frontier. He was an\r\nintimate friend of General Custer, by whom he was chosen to act as the\r\nchief medical officer on the campaign which ended in Custer’s death in\r\n1876. But for his inability to meet the appointment, his career would\r\ndoubtless have terminated at the same time as Custer’s in the disaster\r\nwhich overwhelmed his army.\r\n\r\n_The Myth Wawataw_ is the subject of a brief dissertation, beautifully\r\nprinted, by H. Bedford Jones of Santa Barbara, on the unreliability of\r\nAlexander Henry’s account of the events in the Northwest connected\r\nwith Pontiac’s war. A brief discussion is also included in the booklet\r\non the historical remains at old Michilimackinac.\r\n\r\nThe October, 1917, number of the _Ohio Archeological Historical\r\nQuarterly_ has an article on Muskingum River pilots by Irven Travis\r\nwhich many of our members would take pleasure in reading. The palmy\r\ndays of small river transportation have long since become a part of\r\nhistory, and any information bearing upon the part they played in our\r\nsocial and economic development is treasured by all students of\r\npioneer days.\r\n\r\nTwo articles comprise the contents of the _Indiana Magazine of\r\nHistory_ for September, 1917. The first, “Lincoln in Indiana,” is the\r\nfirst installment of an interesting and suggestive account of the\r\nobscure period in the great Emancipator’s life of which it treats. The\r\nsecond article is the concluding section of a history of the origin\r\nand rise of the Republican Party in Indiana from 1854 to 1860.\r\n\r\nA history of _Western Influences on Political Parties to 1825_, by\r\nHomer C. Hockett, formerly of the University of Wisconsin, is the\r\ntitle of Ohio State University _Bulletin_, vol. 22, number 3, issued\r\nin 1917. Dr. Hockett sketches the growth of political parties in this\r\ncountry from about the middle of the eighteenth century down to the\r\nclose of the first quarter of the nineteenth. Chief emphasis is placed\r\nupon the new political issues that arose out of western conditions\r\nduring this period, and the manner in which they affected national\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\nAmong the important historical periodicals of the country is the\r\n_Catholic Historical Review_ of Washington, now in its third year of\r\npublication. Its sponsors are valiantly sounding a clarion call to\r\ntheir fellow religionists to awake to the importance of their\r\npriceless historical heritage, and to put the preservation and study\r\nof its records on a thoroughly scholarly basis. That these matters\r\nhave been all too little attended to heretofore can hardly be\r\ngainsaid. If the campaign waged by the _Catholic Historical Review_\r\nshall meet with a reasonable measure of success, however, we may\r\nexpect to witness in the not distant future a radical change in the\r\nattitude and actions of the adherents of Catholicism in America with\r\nrespect to the cultivation of their historical domain. For the most\r\npart the writing of sectarian religious histories in the United States\r\nhas been (and now is) conducted on a regretably low plane of\r\nscholarship. Historians of all the denominations (and, indeed, of\r\nwhatever other social groups) would do well to take to heart the\r\nprinciples of scholarly procedure which the _Review_ advocates.\r\n\r\nThe broadly objective viewpoint of this church organ may be concretely\r\nillustrated by citing two or three items from a single issue (that for\r\nOctober, 1917). It is argued that the records of the several dioceses\r\nbe administered on a scientific basis, and be “easily accessible to\r\nall qualified students whether Catholic or non-Catholic.” A generous\r\ntribute is paid to the work of the several state historical societies\r\nin conserving the Catholic history of the land, notwithstanding the\r\nmembership rolls of these societies contain “very few Catholic names,\r\nand very little Catholic generosity finds its way into their\r\ntreasury.” In passing it may be observed that our own Society may\r\nappropriate to itself a fair portion of this tribute, for much has\r\nbeen done, from its earliest days, to conserve the history of the\r\noldest of Christian denominations in Wisconsin. Again, a recently\r\npublished meretricious life of George Washington, written by a certain\r\npriest, meets with castigation as thorough at the hands of the\r\nreviewer as any historical periodical free from church connections\r\ncould have administered. The example of the _Review_ may well be\r\nemulated by the historians of all religious denominations.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary report of the California Historical Survey Commission,\r\nissued in February, 1917, sets forth one of the most ambitious\r\nundertakings in the field of local history that has ever been launched\r\nin this country. An act passed by the legislature of that state in\r\nJune, 1915, provided for the appointment of a commission of three\r\nmembers to make a survey of all local historical material in\r\nCalifornia. An appropriation of ten thousand dollars was made to cover\r\nthe expense of the work. The work mapped out by the commission in its\r\npreliminary report includes a careful survey of the several county\r\narchives in the state, of the state archives, and of those of the\r\nlocal federal offices. Reports are also being gathered from all the\r\npublic libraries, from the collections of historical societies and\r\nother similar institutions. Manuscripts in the possession of private\r\nindividuals are being listed and the files of early newspapers,\r\nrecords of the religious and social organizations and large business\r\nconcerns of the state are all being examined. Already archival records\r\nantedating the organization of the state government have been found,\r\nthe existence of which had been hitherto unsuspected, while records\r\npertaining to land claims under the Spanish and Mexican governments\r\nhave been brought to light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: COLONEL ELLSWORTH AND MISS CARRIE SPAFFORD\r\n   The picture of Colonel Ellsworth is reproduced from an\r\n   original photograph in the Wisconsin Historical Library; that\r\n   of Miss Spafford from a photograph supplied by Mrs. Charles H.\r\n   Godfrey, Rockford, Illinois]\r\n\r\n\r\n  VOL.

ELLSWORTH: FIRST HERO OF THE CIVIL WAR[128]\r\n\r\nCHARLES A. INGRAHAM\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the twenty-ninth of April, 1861, fourteen days after\r\nPresident Lincoln’s call for 75,000 troops, a regiment composed of\r\n1,100 men, uniformed and equipped, marched the streets of New York en\r\nroute to the national capital. Riding at the head of the column was\r\nthe Colonel, a young man of twenty-four, small of stature, with\r\nflashing dark eyes and with a look of authority and power upon his\r\nhandsome features. The crowds along the line of march cheered\r\nenthusiastically as the regiment passed--a magnificent body of men who\r\nat his call had rushed in the space of four days to the colors. It was\r\nEllsworth’s regiment of Zouaves, recruited from the firemen of New\r\nYork City, and afterwards mustered into the service as the Eleventh\r\nNew York Volunteer Infantry.\r\n\r\nBut whence came this wonderful youth who, as if by magic, had called\r\ninto being this stalwart array--bold and fearless men, resenting\r\nrestraint, but submitting cheerfully now to his iron discipline? Not\r\nmany years before, he had been but an obscure country boy of northern\r\nNew York, remote from the places of advancement and culture, a son of\r\nworthy parents, unable, however, to contribute of their limited means\r\nto the furtherance of the ambitious desires of their offspring. In the\r\nbrief space of a year he had achieved national prominence; having had\r\nup to the summer of 1860 but a local reputation, confined to Chicago\r\nand its vicinity, he became the popular idol of the entire northern\r\ncountry. At the head of his United States Zouave Cadets he had toured\r\nthe leading eastern cities and won distinction for the extraordinary\r\nperfection of drill exhibited by his command. Shining through all this\r\nhistoric expedition appears preëminent the attractive personality of\r\nthe young captain--knightly, magnetic, winning, lofty of character,\r\nable to control every one of his cadets under the imperious rule of\r\nhis native authority and undeviating rectitude.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the twenty-fourth of May, less than a month from the\r\ndeparture of the Fire Zouaves from New York, Ellsworth was killed at\r\nAlexandria. Not in vain was his fall, for it caused the hesitating\r\nnorthern people to reach firmly at last for the rifle. “Ellsworth’s\r\nAvengers,” the Forty-fourth New York Volunteer Infantry, recruited\r\nfrom every county of the Empire State, with unusual physical\r\nrequirements and moral standards, marched from their encampment at\r\nAlbany for the front on October 21, 1861. Well did they fulfill the\r\nname they bore, for on many a battle field this somewhat Puritanical\r\nregiment, remarkable for the scholarship and worth of its rank and\r\nfile, never forgot the assassination of Ellsworth as they carried\r\ntheir rent colors against the foe. Still another regiment of New York\r\nCity firemen, the Second Fire Zouaves, or the Seventy-third New York\r\nVolunteer Infantry, was recruited under the inspiration of Ellsworth’s\r\nname and was mustered into the service on July 10, 1861. Reënlisting\r\nin 1864, it had a continuous service to the close of the war and\r\nenjoys a magnificent history.\r\n\r\nThus Ellsworth had, to his immediate, demonstrable credit, the\r\nmustering in of three regiments, which constituted, however, but a\r\nsmall proportion of the multitude whose patriotic devotion was evoked\r\nby his death and who followed the flag into the service. Yet many\r\nbelieve him to have been but a rash and adventurous person, vain and\r\nsuperficial. My study of his life, however, convinces me of the error\r\nof such opinion and that he was a young man of extraordinary gifts,\r\nprudent thought, gentle, loving instincts, and one who had been\r\nbaptized with a fervent spirit of patriotism. Abraham Lincoln\r\nrecognized his wonderful abilities and admirable traits of character\r\nand loved him for them, had his stricken, cold body brought to the\r\nWhite House, and wept over his remains as he would have grieved over\r\nthose of his own son. And John Hay, in two notable magazine articles,\r\none written soon after Ellsworth’s fall, the other towards the close\r\nof Mr. Hay’s career, has nothing but eulogy for the noble youth whom\r\nhe had intimately known and loved as a brother. Surely, young\r\nEllsworth had in him the elements of greatness! Schooled in poverty,\r\ndisciplined by hardship and disappointment, his life is yet a shining\r\npath of pure living, high purpose, devoted patriotism, and worthy\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nThe motorist who seeks the birthplace of Ellsworth leaves the city of\r\nTroy, crosses to the west side of the Hudson at the northern limits of\r\nthe town, and follows the macadam road along the river northward\r\nfourteen miles to the city of Mechanicsville. Here he will leave the\r\nriver and proceeding in a northwesterly direction over a fine state\r\nroad will reach at a distance of nine miles the little village of\r\nMalta, Saratoga County, seven miles this side of the city of Saratoga\r\nSprings. At Malta, Elmer Ephraim Ellsworth was born on April 11, 1837.\r\nThe hamlet is much like thousands of others scattered over our eastern\r\nstates; it claims its four corners, church, schoolhouse, and general\r\nstore, but, with its spacious square, shade trees, and pleasant\r\ndwellings, it is more attractive than the average small village. The\r\nhouse in which Ellsworth first saw the light is yet standing, a well\r\npreserved, small, story-and-a-half structure, looking cheerfully out\r\non the great road where thousands pass, ignorant of the honor which it\r\npossesses. It has been called “the low-browed cottage,” a\r\ncharacterization which is appropriate, for two small, oblong windows\r\nare suggestive of eyes peering out from under the eaves. Ephraim D.\r\nEllsworth, Elmer’s father, a worthy citizen and a tailor by trade, in\r\n1836 married Phoebe Denton who resided here, and employed himself at\r\nthis place in the business of his calling. He was of English\r\nextraction, born in the town of Halfmoon, Saratoga County, New York,\r\nand a man of bright intellect. His grandfather, George Ellsworth, as a\r\nboy of fifteen joined the American army operating against Burgoyne,\r\nfought in the battle of Saratoga, and was present at the subsequent\r\nsurrender of the British army. George Ellsworth was thus a yet-living\r\ninfluence to develop the patriotic and martial spirit of his\r\ngreat-grandson, and, added to the special interest he took in the\r\nexciting story of the boy-soldier’s adventures, was the realizing\r\nassistance afforded by the proximity of the battle field, nine miles\r\naway. Phoebe Denton could no more trace a distinguished ancestry than\r\ncould her husband, and all that is available concerning her is that on\r\nher father’s side she had an English lineage, and on her mother’s, a\r\n“Scotch Presbyterian.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF ELMER E. ELLSWORTH, MALTA, NEW YORK]\r\n\r\nThe boyhood life of Elmer in Malta was isolated enough but was\r\nrelieved somewhat by the nearness of Saratoga Springs, which in those\r\ntimes was a leading watering-place of the country, where the wealth\r\nand fashion of the land disported itself. Many costly equipages every\r\nseason would pass through the village, bound to and from Saratoga, not\r\na few of them belonging to the southern aristocracy and having ebony\r\ncoachmen on the box. Only two miles east is the beautiful Saratoga\r\nLake, with the charms of which he was familiar. He was a good student\r\nin the district school, but not at all precocious or remarkable as a\r\nscholar. He was cheerful, fond of and a leader in all games and\r\nsports, but his greatest enjoyment was in reading; he would become\r\nlost for hours in a book, heedless of the lapse of time. His mother\r\nwas a pious woman and from her and the services of the Presbyterian\r\nchurch he derived deep religious convictions which he maintained\r\nthroughout his life. He became, also, at an early age, a pronounced\r\ntemperance disciple and, having heard a lecturer say that the devil\r\ndwelt in a cider barrel, wanted to take a “gun and cussion cap” and\r\nshoot him. His mother has left on record many interesting instances of\r\nhis philosophical character and original sayings, but there is not\r\nroom here to give them place. I may, however, be permitted to mention\r\nhis purchase of his brother Charlie, the one other child in the\r\nfamily. Charlie was three years younger than Elmer, and the older\r\nbrother conceiving a great fondness for him while he was yet a babe,\r\nand desiring him for his own, bought him of his parents for six\r\nshillings. From that time forward Elmer assumed a sort of guardianship\r\nover him and maintained that sense of obligation up to the day of\r\nCharlie’s death. At an early age he began to evidence a proclivity for\r\nmilitary studies and employments by exhibiting a preference for books\r\ndealing with war and battles; when but nine years of age he drew with\r\nwagon-paints on one side of a window shade a picture of General\r\nWashington and staff, and on the reverse side one of General Jackson\r\nand staff. A natural aptitude for sketching was further developed as\r\nhe grew older and was of practical help to him in his military\r\noccupations. Many of his sketches are still preserved and cherished.\r\nAfter he had spent a year as a clerk in the employ of a Mr. DeGroff,\r\nwho kept a general store at Malta, the family moved to Mechanicsville.\r\n\r\nThe ambition which Elmer had cherished of entering West Point Military\r\nAcademy might have been realized had there been at Mechanicsville\r\neducational advantages whereby he could have gained the proper\r\npreparation, but the village, then a place of about 800 inhabitants,\r\nhad nothing higher than district schools, and his father had not the\r\nmeans to send him to an academy. He attended the school located on\r\nNorth Main Street, a brick building still standing and converted into\r\nan attractive residence. Mr. Ellsworth’s trade seems not to have\r\nafforded him a sufficient income, for he adopted various makeshifts in\r\norder to provide for his family, such as peddling oysters, netting\r\npigeons, and other like employments. Elmer was sometimes sneered at by\r\nhis companions on account of his father’s poverty and one day he\r\nwhipped a boy soundly who had called him, “oyster-keg.”\r\n\r\nAll this made a deep wound in the proud and sensitive heart of the\r\nboy, and throughout his career, in his letters and diary, may still be\r\nread the ever-recurring refrain of his desire to remove his parents\r\nfrom lives of grinding toil and carking care. This absorbing thought\r\nhad been observed by President Lincoln and was mentioned in his letter\r\nto Colonel Ellsworth’s bereaved parents as “conclusive of his good\r\nheart.” But Elmer had the great privilege while living in\r\nMechanicsville of organizing and having under him a military company:\r\nthe Black Plumed Riflemen, of Stillwater, an historic village three\r\nmiles above Mechanicsville. At this time, although but fifteen, short\r\nand slight of build, he would go through the manual of arms with the\r\nheavy muskets of those days with wonderful ease and rapidity.\r\nThroughout his life he was ever of a strong, virile constitution;\r\nquick, active, alert, he became in after years an accurate shot and a\r\nfine swordsman. Illustrative of his strength and agility and as\r\nexhibiting his qualification to lead others in performing startling\r\nfeats, it is still told in Mechanicsville that one day a clerk in\r\nHatfield’s store (now the Mead Building) having heard a commotion in\r\nthe second story, upon investigation, found that Ellsworth and the\r\nBlack Plumed Riflemen had ascended there on a “human ladder”; the last\r\nones were pulled up through the doorway from the sidewalk. Though\r\nMechanicsville has grown to be a place of more than 8,000 population,\r\nthe older parts of the town remain very much as when Ellsworth paraded\r\nthe streets with his riflemen. The old home, a pleasant dwelling on\r\nEllsworth Street in the southern part of the place, still stands amid\r\nsurroundings practically unchanged. The premises front on the\r\nembankment of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad; in the rear flows the\r\nnow abandoned section of the Champlain Canal. Just south of the home\r\nand on the rise of ground is the residence of Robert Sears, deceased,\r\nwho was an intimate friend of the family and who accompanied the\r\nstricken parents to New York to meet the remains of their son. Elmer\r\nwas a welcome visitor here, where he and his companion, Charles Sears,\r\nhad many a happy romp in the fields about the homestead. It is\r\nneedless to say that the remembrance of Colonel Ellsworth is still a\r\nsacred one in the Sears family and that his memorials are cherished in\r\nthe white mansion on the hill where he was gladly entertained and duly\r\nappreciated; for even at this early age it was evident that he was a\r\nlad of superior parts. Certain of the citizens have suggested changing\r\nthe name of the place to “Ellsworth” and erecting a fitting monument\r\nin the midst of the city, a commendable proposal, though there are\r\nalready nine villages named Ellsworth in as many states of the\r\ncountry, and notwithstanding that a noble granite memorial to his\r\nmemory, unveiled with elaborate and impressive ceremonies on May 27,\r\n1874, stands in the Mechanicsville cemetery.\r\n\r\nElmer’s stay in Mechanicsville did not embrace above a year or more,\r\nand after having had considerable success in selling papers on the\r\nrailway trains, he secured the consent of his father to leave home and\r\ntry to make his own way in the world. He, therefore, in 1852, secured\r\nemployment as a clerk in the store of Corliss & House, Troy, dealers\r\nin linen goods, where he remained about a year. The career of\r\nEllsworth from now on to 1858 is difficult to follow in detail on\r\naccount of the as yet scarcity of data from which to construct a\r\nsatisfactory narrative. It is known, however, that from the time he\r\nleft Mechanicsville to the hour of his death, his life, though in its\r\nlast two years astonishingly prominent and in point of honorable fame\r\nhighly successful, was throughout an experience of almost unremitting\r\nhardship and poverty; a beating about from one employment to another;\r\na weary history of uncongenial labor and foiled ambition. It is\r\nprobable that he was, to use his own words, endeavoring to “make a\r\nbold push for fortune,” that he might quickly relieve his parents of\r\nthat toil and privation, the remembrance of which seems to have burned\r\ninto his soul to remain smarting there through the long years. Perhaps\r\nit would be charity to allow the mantle of forgetfulness to remain\r\nupon this period of unrequited effort, though from the glimpses we\r\nhave in it of Ellsworth he is smiling and cheerful through it all,\r\never maintaining the most scrupulous honor and unblemished character.\r\nBut the American people will desire the uncovering of every detail of\r\nthe life of this remarkable young genius and martyr, whose very gifts\r\nof mind and heart, like those of many another, made him the prey of\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nOn August 2, 1917, there appeared in the _Telegraph-Courier_ of\r\nKenosha, Wisconsin, a letter from Charles H. Goffe, a former resident\r\nof the city, and among his reminiscences of Kenosha is the following\r\nconcerning Ellsworth in the summer of 1853, Elmer being then sixteen\r\nyears old. I have nothing with which to corroborate Mr. Goffe’s\r\nstatement, but as it has the impress of truth and corresponds, though\r\nin an exaggerated manner, with what I have learned of Ellsworth’s\r\ntraits of character, I am disposed to give it acceptance. It is my\r\nopinion that, having saved a sum of money from his salary as a clerk\r\nin Troy, he resolved to “plod along” no further but to “make a bold\r\npush for fortune” in the West, and endeavor to find by prospecting a\r\nmore promising field. Mr. Goffe writes:\r\n\r\n“There was also boarding at Mrs. Bell’s at this time, a young man of\r\nhandsome features and fastidious ways, accentuated by a repelling\r\nhauteur and exclusiveness, so often found peculiar to genius. His\r\nassociates were few and his disposition was not calculated to make\r\nintimates of those he came in contact with. No one seemed able to\r\npenetrate the mystery of his personality and yet there was something\r\nabout the youth which arrested the attention of all. But he was\r\nobsessed with a penchant or habit born perhaps of idle vanity of\r\nwriting (or scribbling) his name in a bold, flowing, and not\r\nungraceful hand, upon every scrap of paper, on the weatherboards of\r\nthe house, and on gate and fence posts, a name which a few years later\r\nwas on every tongue, flashed in the headlines of the daily press, and\r\nstamped in deathless lines upon the history of his country--the name\r\nof Elmer E. Ellsworth…. In the fall of 1853, when the Kenosha High\r\nSchool opened for the winter term under Professor DeWolff, Mr.\r\nEllsworth attended for a while, but was not satisfied with school\r\nlife, and suddenly dropped out of view and was for a time forgotten.”\r\n\r\nMr. Goffe says that when, two years later, he went to Muskegon, across\r\nthe lake in Michigan, he learned that Ellsworth had associated with\r\nand been adopted by the Ottawa Indians who dwelt in those parts. After\r\ndescribing how he had been created a chief among them, made the\r\nrecipient of high honors, and adorned with unique and gaudy apparel.\r\nMr. Goffe continues:\r\n\r\n“But, alas, when the novelty of barbaric glory and display had become\r\nstale, and the craving for other conquests and other scenes, and\r\nperhaps dreams of awaiting glories had disturbed his vision, this\r\neccentric child of genius suddenly disappeared from his tribe and had\r\ngone no one could tell where. His people waited long, but he returned\r\nno more, and the red-skinned maidens of the tamarack swamps waited and\r\nsighed in vain for the handsome young chief on whom they had doted,\r\nand for whom they had hoped and dreamed. And the seasons came and\r\npassed, and the moons had filled their horns many times only to wane\r\nand the white chief came no more.”\r\n\r\nAs stated before, it is probable that Ellsworth visited Kenosha and it\r\nis likely, too, that on his way home he stopped at Muskegon and was\r\nwith the Indians for a brief period, but that he remained there a year\r\nor more, as Mr. Goffe was told, or that he made any extended stay\r\namong the Redskins is highly improbable, though I realize that in\r\nexpressing this opinion I am throwing ashes on what purports to be a\r\nromantic episode.\r\n\r\nReturning to Mechanicsville and casting about for employment,\r\nEllsworth recalled that in one of his trips between Troy and his home\r\nhe had met on the train a gentleman from New York who, evidently\r\nattracted by his intelligent and prepossessing appearance, drew him\r\ninto conversation and impressed himself favorably on the youth’s mind\r\nand memory. Thinking that this transient friend might help him, he\r\ninserted a “personal” in the New York _Herald_ which in due time\r\nbrought a letter from the gentleman, who proved to be a drygoods\r\nmerchant, and after a preparatory correspondence Ellsworth was made a\r\nclerk in his store. This was in 1853, the year of his visit to the\r\nWest and Kenosha.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DRAWING MADE BY COLONEL ELLSWORTH\r\n   Reproduced from the original in the Wisconsin Historical Library]\r\n\r\nConcerning the two years that he spent in New York I have been able to\r\nsecure but fragmentary and disconnected data. He remained but half of\r\nthis period in the employ of the merchant referred to and when, in\r\n1855, he went to Chicago, he did so in company with a party of\r\nengineers by whom he had been employed in improving the channel at\r\nHellgate, not far from New York. This work was carried on by the aid\r\nof divers who deposited the explosive on the surface of the rock and\r\nthis being fired by electricity and confined somewhat by the weight of\r\nwater effected considerable execution. Just what part Ellsworth played\r\nin this work or how long he was engaged in it is not known. While in\r\nNew York he was afforded an opportunity of acquiring a better\r\nknowledge of military tactics through the drills of the Seventh\r\nRegiment, which he attended on every available occasion.\r\n\r\nHe was eighteen years of age when, with his brother, he went to\r\nChicago, hoping to make better progress in providing means for the\r\nease, security, and happiness of their parents. For, while yet a\r\nlittle boy in Malta, having been pained by the cruel words of a\r\ncompanion who had sneeringly remarked that his mother wore “patched\r\nshoes,” he had told her that he would some day earn a lot of money so\r\nthat she would be a lady as well as the best and “ride in a carriage.”\r\nThis ambition for his mother, that she might “ride in a carriage,” was\r\nreferred to hopefully in a letter dated Madison, Wisconsin, November\r\n15, 1858. Though his brother, after remaining but a brief season in\r\nChicago, seems to have given up the battle and returned home, Elmer\r\nheld on and through the most discouraging experiences persevered and\r\nat last achieved a success which repaid him for all his suffering and\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\nNot long after his arrival in Chicago he engaged himself as a clerk to\r\nArthur F. Devereux, of Salem, Massachusetts, who was in the patent\r\nsoliciting business and who later became an officer in the Eighth\r\nMassachusetts Regiment. Ellsworth after a time became a partner with\r\nMr. Devereux and the firm enjoyed prosperity when, through the\r\ndefalcation of one whom they trusted, everything was lost and Elmer\r\nfound himself without a dollar struggling again for the bare\r\nnecessities of life. Three years had been passed in this business, as\r\nappears from Ellsworth’s own words. He writes: “In an evil hour I\r\nplaced confidence in an infernal scoundrel, was robbed of everything\r\nin a moment, saw the reward of three years’ toil fade from my eyes\r\nwhen about to grasp it.”\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of this catastrophe brings Ellsworth’s career down to\r\n1858, he then being of the age of twenty-one. Connected with the\r\nbusiness of a patent solicitor are certain legal aspects that require\r\nattention, and having in this way in a manner been introduced to the\r\nlaw, he determined to prepare himself for the full practice of that\r\nprofession. He therefore entered the law office of Mr. J. E. Cone as a\r\nstudent. The remuneration he received for copying legal papers was\r\nwholly inadequate; for a time he slept on the floor of the office, and\r\nsuffered, not infrequently, the pangs of hunger. During these months\r\nof hard study, drudgery of copying, and abject poverty, he retained\r\nhis interest in military affairs, though he had no active part in them\r\nfor the reason that he could not afford the expense of belonging to a\r\ncompany. However, he joined a gymnasium and made the acquaintance of\r\nDr. Charles A. DeVilliers, who was an instructor in fencing, evidently\r\nin that institution. Dr. DeVilliers was destined to play an important\r\npart in the military education and career of Ellsworth, for he revived\r\nin him his ardent martial spirit and encouraged him in his desire to\r\nacquire an intimate knowledge of the French Zouave system of tactics\r\nand uniform with a view to introducing them into this country.\r\nDeVilliers was competent for this purpose, having served with a French\r\nZouave regiment in the Crimean War and was familiar with all the\r\ndetails of their drill and equipment. The name and system were derived\r\nby the French in 1830 from the members of a mountain tribe of Algeria,\r\n(Arab., Zwawá) who, arrayed in oriental costume, wide trousers, fez,\r\nand loose jacket, were in their rapidity of movement and ferocity of\r\ncourage famed as fighters. Ellsworth, of a romantic nature and a lover\r\nof the novel and dramatic, was attracted by this now famous and\r\nspectacular system, and sent to France for books fully explaining it\r\nand set himself to acquire the language that he might read them. In\r\nthe meantime, with Scott’s and Hardee’s books of tactics open before\r\nhim, he perfected himself in the manual of arms, not hesitating to\r\nintroduce improvements of his own where they seemed desirable, his\r\nendeavor being to bring ease, grace, and celerity into every movement.\r\nUnder DeVillier’s instruction he became the best fencer in Chicago,\r\nwhile his “lightning drill” attracted attention as he exhibited it in\r\nthe gymnasium.\r\n\r\nHis reputation having reached as far as Rockford, Illinois, he was\r\nengaged in the summer of 1858 to drill the Rockford City Grays, a\r\ncompany that had been organized two years earlier. The corps made good\r\nprogress and in September went into camp on the fairgrounds, remaining\r\nfour days, during which time military companies from Elgin, Freeport,\r\nand Chicago visited the encampment. During his stay at Rockford\r\nEllsworth made the acquaintance of Miss Carrie Spafford, to whom he\r\nbecame engaged, and for whom to the day of his death he cherished the\r\nhighest regard and the deepest affection. Her father, Mr. Charles H.\r\nSpafford, was one of the pioneers and a leading citizen of the place\r\nand with his family was attached to Ellsworth and befriended him more,\r\nperhaps, than any others outside of his immediate relatives. In his\r\nlast letter to Miss Spafford he refers to her parents as “father and\r\nmother.” Mrs. Charles H. Godfrey, a sister of Miss Spafford, still\r\nresides at Rockford and occupies the dwelling where Colonel Ellsworth\r\nvisited the family in 1858, and though she has no remembrance of him\r\nshe cherishes the honor that her Christian name, Eugenia, was by him\r\nproposed for her to the family when he fondled her on his knee. Miss\r\nCarrie Spafford married Charles S. Brett, both of whom with their only\r\nson are deceased, Mrs. Brett having died in 1911 at the old home where\r\nthe Colonel visited her. Not only did Ellsworth win the friendship and\r\nregard of the Spafford family, but his cordial manners and magnetic\r\npersonality made him a marked individuality and a popular hero\r\nthroughout the town.\r\n\r\nIn the following month of October Ellsworth went to Madison,\r\nWisconsin, and was employed there in drilling the Governor’s Guard, a\r\nmilitary company organized in February of that year and made up of the\r\nleading young men of the place. It is on record that on October 15,\r\n1858, he was elected commandant of the Guard and began drilling the\r\ncompany, which at the beginning numbered twenty-five men, three\r\nevenings in each week. There is nothing to indicate how long he\r\nremained at Madison, though a letter to his mother, already referred\r\nto, bears date, “Capitol House, Madison, Wis., Nov. 15th, 1858,” and\r\nit is probable that he was with the Governor’s Guard in its parade of\r\nDecember 26 following, concerning which a Madison newspaper says,\r\n“They appear much improved in a military point.” The State Historical\r\nSociety of Wisconsin has in its archives several interesting memorials\r\nof Ellsworth’s sojourn in Madison. There is some evidence that he\r\ndrilled a company in Springfield, Illinois, at about this period, but\r\nthe statements are so indefinite and inconclusive that I have\r\nrefrained from giving them as facts. In a study of this kind it is\r\nnecessary carefully to compare, weigh, and sift all the materials of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nA definite landmark in the life of Ellsworth is his diary, commenced\r\non his twenty-second birthday, April 11, 1859, and continued for a\r\nbrief period.[129] This was in the spring following his agreeable and\r\nsuccessful military employment at Rockford and Madison, but from which\r\nhe seems to have derived no considerable emolument, for the entries in\r\nhis diary relate experiences of his struggle with poverty. Concerning\r\nthe purpose of the journal, he says: “I do this because it seems\r\npleasant to be able to look back upon our past lives and note the\r\ngradual change in our sentiments and views of life; and because my\r\nlife has been and bids fair to be such a jumble of strange incidents\r\nthat, should I become anybody or anything, this will be useful as a\r\nmeans of showing how much suffering and temptation a man may undergo\r\nand still keep clear of despair and vice.” These pages afford an\r\nintimate view of his character and one which can be obtained from no\r\nother source; for they are even more personal and confidential than\r\nhis letters to the members of his own family. They tell in easy,\r\nfluent style of his poverty, temptations, dawning success,\r\nmeditations, and laborious study of the law in the office of Mr. Cone,\r\nto which he had returned after his engagement had expired in Madison.\r\n\r\nAmong the earlier entries in the diary is the account of his election\r\non April 29, 1859, as commandant of the United States Zouave Cadets,\r\nof Chicago, a company superseding the National Guard Cadets,\r\ninstituted three years previous, which company had become practically\r\ndefunct. On abandoning the old name and armory the Zouaves made their\r\nquarters in the Garrett Block on ground now occupied by Central Music\r\nHall. The drill and discipline of the corps grew to be more exacting\r\nand severe probably, than that to which any military company was ever\r\nsubjected, for Ellsworth’s aim was to improve the men “morally as well\r\nas physically” and “to place the company in a position second to none\r\nin the United States.” The rules adopted and rigidly enforced\r\nproscribed drinking or even entering, without a valid excuse, a\r\nbarroom, forbade visiting houses of vulgar resort, and gambling rooms,\r\nand prohibited the playing of billiards in public places. Ellsworth,\r\nhimself, all his life was very abstemious; in a letter to his brother\r\nin 1858, he writes: “I don’t use tobacco in any shape whatever; I\r\ndrink neither tea or coffee.” Running all through his career is the\r\nunmistakable evidence, especially visible in his private papers, that\r\nhe was above all a moral champion: that his ethical principles\r\novershadowed and governed his military ambitions. The proficiency of a\r\ncadet was no recommendation to his leniency: if he transgressed the\r\nrules, he must go: twelve of his best drilled men were expelled at one\r\ntime for drinking; but such was his influence over his command that as\r\nthey dwindled away there was never a stampede, even under the\r\nlaborious drills and the prohibitory discipline.\r\n\r\nOn the Fourth of July Ellsworth, having had the cadets in training but\r\nlittle more than two months, gave a public drill in front of the\r\nTremont House and at once won the admiration of hostile critics, who\r\npronounced the exhibition unrivaled outside West Point. This success\r\nwas all the more remarkable when it is considered that Ellsworth had\r\nacquired his military knowledge entirely from self-instruction, never\r\nhaving been a member of a company when he began the occupation of\r\ndrillmaster. Moreover, he was still very poor, subsisting part of the\r\ntime on nothing better than crackers; but he could write proudly in\r\nhis diary on the night of the Fourth: “Victory, and thank God!”\r\n\r\nAt Chicago on September 15 of the same year, at the seventh annual\r\nfair of the National Agricultural Society, Ellsworth with his Zouaves\r\nwon a stand of colors valued at $500, which had been offered as a\r\nprize in a competitive drill. Owing to the fact that only one other\r\ncompany drilled for the award, though the contest had been open to any\r\nmilitia company in the country, great dissatisfaction prevailed\r\nthroughout the East and South that the Zouaves should under the\r\ncircumstances be accorded such a distinction. The old military\r\ncompanies of the eastern cities scorned the pretentions of the\r\n“prairie boys,” and ridiculed the idea of their being able to compete\r\nsuccessfully with themselves. For Ellsworth had added fuel to the fire\r\nby challenging any company in the United States or Canada to drill for\r\nthe champion colors, offering to pay their expenses to and from\r\nChicago and stating that, starting on the following twentieth of June,\r\nthe Zouaves would visit the leading cities of the country for the\r\npurpose of meeting those companies which had not found it convenient\r\nto come to Chicago.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: COLONEL ELLSWORTH AND FRANCIS E. BROWNELL\r\n                                         (IN LOWER RIGHT-HAND CORNER)\r\n   From original photographs in the collection of Frederick H.\r\n   Meserve, New York]\r\n\r\nThe discipline and drill, beginning early in February, became more\r\nexacting than ever, as it was felt by the company that in order to\r\nretain the colors the orders of the commandant must be scrupulously\r\nobserved. Ellsworth told them that “everything except business and the\r\ncompany must be sacrificed” and that till the date set for the\r\ndeparture, drills must be held every evening, except Sunday, from\r\nseven to eleven o’clock. Associated with the drill, which was\r\npracticed with knapsacks weighing twenty-three pounds, were strenuous\r\nathletic exercises, while through the month of June the men slept on\r\nthe floor of the armory wrapped in their blankets. The start was\r\npostponed from June 20 to July 2, owing to the death from smallpox of\r\nEllsworth’s brother, who was a member of the company. This bereavement\r\nwas a hard stroke for the commandant, who was already burdened with\r\nthe care and discipline of the company and anxiety for the results. It\r\nwas estimated that five weeks would be consumed in the tour and that\r\nthe expenditures would approximate $7,000, but the funds were far from\r\nbeing raised when the day of departure arrived. Moreover, the\r\ncompany’s goods and chattels were attached by certain ex-members who\r\nhad loaned it money and who were now smarting from the effects of\r\nEllsworth’s severe discipline; but this difficulty was quickly\r\nrelieved by the generosity of Chicago citizens.\r\n\r\nThe last reunion of Ellsworth’s Chicago Zouaves was held at the\r\nWellington Hotel, Chicago, in November, 1910, at which eight members\r\nwere present; five absentees were known to be living at that time. I\r\nhave recently corresponded with Mr. J. M. DeWitt of New York, who is\r\nactively engaged in practical affairs, with Mr. Frank E. Yates of\r\nChicago, and, through his family, with Mr. J. A. Clybourn, of the same\r\ncity, who is in very poor health. This band of men, sifted out by\r\nEllsworth and tried by the fire of his rigorous discipline and\r\ntraining, not only achieved the reputation of being perhaps the most\r\nperfectly drilled military company in history, but held important\r\nplaces in the army during the Civil War and multiplied the\r\ninstructions and principles which they had derived from their\r\ncommandant.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Historical Society has in its Ellsworth collection a\r\ncrayon sketch drawn by him and evidently designed to serve as copy for\r\nthe printer in preparing memorials of the tour, to be presented to the\r\nmembers of the company. Upon it are inscribed in consecutive order the\r\nnames of the cities visited and the military organizations by whom the\r\nZouaves were escorted and entertained, though the dates do not appear\r\nin all cases. The itinerary follows:\r\n\r\nChicago, July 2, 1860; Adrian, Mich., July 3 and 4; Detroit, July 5;\r\nCleveland, July 6 and 7; Niagara Falls, Sunday; Rochester, July --;\r\nSyracuse, July --; Utica, July --; Troy, July 12; Albany, July 13; New\r\nYork, July 14, 15, 16, --, 18, 19, 20; Boston, July 21, 22, 23, 25;\r\nCharlestown, Mass., July 24; Salem, July --; West Point, July 26, 27;\r\nPhiladelphia, July 28; Baltimore, Aug. --; Washington, D. C., Mount\r\nVernon, Aug. --; Pittsburgh, Aug. --; Cincinnati, Aug. --; St. Louis,\r\nAug. --; Springfield, Aug. --; Chicago, Aug. 15.\r\n\r\nThe Zouaves were accompanied throughout their tour by a band of\r\neighteen pieces, the Light Guard Band of Chicago; but though the\r\ncompany went forth with fine melody and unique and brilliant uniforms,\r\nthey were hardy soldiers with bronzed faces and wiry, agile frames,\r\nwho lived abstemiously and slept each night on the floor of their\r\nquarters. Temptations to indulge in wines and liquors were before them\r\ndaily, but they resolutely turned away to take up the arduous work of\r\ntheir program. They were very young and somewhat undersized; by no\r\nmeans a stalwart array, as might be expected; but the wonderful\r\nprecision, celerity, and grace of their drill and evolutions\r\nastonished and thrilled every town they visited, and the accounts of\r\ntheir marvelous proficiency, telegraphed ahead, aroused widespread\r\ncuriosity and brought great crowds to observe them wherever they went.\r\nThough the tour was made for the purpose of inviting competition, not\r\na company ventured to face them, all cheerfully according them the\r\npalm of superiority.\r\n\r\nThe period in which the tour was made could not have been more\r\nopportune; a critical presidential election was on, with Abraham\r\nLincoln heading the Republican party which stood for the nonextension\r\nof slavery, and with the avowal rife in the South that, should he be\r\nelected, war would ensue. Thus, the people were disposed to look with\r\ninterest and enthusiasm upon military demonstrations. Ellsworth’s\r\nexperience was not, however, entirely without anxiety, owing to the\r\nlack of funds, which, until New York City was reached, was a source of\r\nworry; but at this point and in Boston large amounts were derived from\r\nexhibition drills given before immense audiences, and henceforward no\r\ndifficulty was experienced on this score. The company reached Chicago\r\non Tuesday, August 15, was accorded an ovation irrespective of party\r\naffiliations, and escorted to the accompaniment of pyrotechnics and a\r\ntorch-light procession, to the “Wigwam” where Lincoln had been\r\nnominated, which was filled with more than 10,000 people. Mayor\r\nWentworth gave a congratulatory address which was briefly responded to\r\nby Captain Ellsworth, after which, it now being midnight, the company\r\nwas banqueted at the Briggs House.\r\n\r\nNot long after this triumphant return Ellsworth resigned his\r\ncommission and the company disbanded. Its career having been\r\nbrilliant, though brief, it was better, it seemed to him, that the\r\norganization should dissolve rather than deteriorate under less\r\nrigorous discipline. Ellsworth, without delay, seeming to realize that\r\narmed strife was at hand, organized a regiment of Zouaves in northern\r\nIllinois, officered it with men from his old company, and presented\r\nthe force to Governor Yates to direct as he might deem expedient.\r\nHaving become acquainted with Mr. Lincoln, he now entered his law\r\noffice, not so much to pursue his somewhat neglected law studies as to\r\npromote a scheme which he was evolving of reorganizing the militia of\r\nIllinois and eventually of the whole country: to unify and bring the\r\nentire system more completely under the control of a central\r\nauthority. Here begins to be manifest a wide grasp and a broad vision\r\nfor which Ellsworth has never been given credit. To enjoy a reputation\r\nas a successful drillmaster and to control efficiently a company of\r\nfifty men was but the rudiment of his ambition and capacity; his mind\r\nwent out firmly and sanely to broad fields, and he impressed his ideas\r\nupon Mr. Lincoln, who sought to give him an opportunity at the\r\nnational capital to work out and put in operation these desirable\r\nmeasures. A start was attempted in a bill dictated by Ellsworth and\r\nintroduced in the Illinois legislature while he was in Springfield,\r\nbut though it was successful in the House, it failed in the Senate\r\nthrough causes other than a lack of merit.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn, Ellsworth employed himself on the stump, speaking\r\nfor the Republican candidates, and exhibited decided gifts as an\r\norator; a fine voice and presence, abundant humor and fluent\r\nexpression gained him a ready hearing. In the meantime he had resumed\r\nhis legal studies and later, passing a satisfactory examination, was\r\nadmitted to the bar a few weeks before Mr. Lincoln started on his\r\njourney to Washington. The president-elect had invited Ellsworth to\r\naccompany him on the trip in the capacity of an officer to safeguard\r\nhim by superintending the disposition of the crowds that everywhere\r\nmet him. Arriving at the capital he was incapacitated with the\r\nmeasles, but when, on his twenty-fourth birthday, April 11, 1861, Fort\r\nSumter was summoned to surrender, he soon shook off the lethargy of\r\nhis convalescence, resigned his lieutenant’s commission, borrowed what\r\nmoney John Hay had at his disposal, and started for New York, resolved\r\nto raise a regiment for the service. In this he was promptly\r\nsuccessful among the firemen of the city and in a remarkably brief\r\nspace, at the head of the Eleventh New York Volunteer Infantry, was on\r\nMay 7 mustered into the service in front of the Capitol at Washington\r\nand in the presence of President Lincoln. For a few days the regiment\r\nwas quartered in the Capitol building, but as the command was\r\nacquiring a tendency to disregard the proprieties of the service,\r\nColonel Ellsworth secured for it a camp on the south side of the east\r\nbranch of the Potomac, on the high ground in the vicinity of the\r\nInsane Asylum, believing that here he would have the men under better\r\ncontrol. An interesting, and to the Fire Zouaves a complimentary,\r\nevent occurred while the regiment was in Washington. Willard’s Hotel\r\nhaving taken fire, Ellsworth and his men after vigorous efforts\r\nquenched the flames and saved the building, much to the gratification\r\nof Mr. Willard, who entertained them at breakfast and gave Colonel\r\nEllsworth a purse of $500 to employ for the benefit of the regiment.\r\nThis money the Colonel turned over to the committee that organized and\r\nequipped the Fire Zouaves, and it was eventually divided equally and\r\napplied toward the erection of monuments for Ellsworth and his\r\nsuccessor, Colonel Farnham, who died of wounds sustained at the first\r\nbattle of Bull Run.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Thursday, May 23, the regiment was ordered to be\r\nready to move at a moment’s notice, and at 2 o’clock A. M. of the\r\ntwenty-fourth marched from its camp and boarded the steamers _James\r\nGuy_ and _Mount Vernon_. In the bustle and stress incident to the\r\ndeparture, the busy Colonel found time to write two remarkable\r\nletters: one to his parents, the other to Miss Spafford, his fiancée.\r\nThey breathe a presentiment of death and were found (at least the\r\nformer, and I think the latter) upon his body. The letter addressed to\r\nMiss Spafford has not appeared before in print and has been read by\r\nbut a limited number of persons. Colonel Ellsworth’s last act before\r\nleaving his tent was to look at her portrait and place it in his\r\nbosom.[130]\r\n\r\n     My dear Father and Mother: The Regiment is ordered to move\r\n     across the river tonight. We have no means of knowing what\r\n     reception we are to meet with. I am inclined to the opinion\r\n     that our entrance to the City of Alexandria will be hotly\r\n     contested, as I am just informed that a large force have\r\n     arrived there today. Should this happen, my dear parents, it\r\n     may be my lot to be injured in some manner. Whatever may\r\n     happen, cherish the consolation that I was engaged in the\r\n     performance of a sacred duty; and tonight, thinking over the\r\n     probabilities of tomorrow, and the occurrences of the past,\r\n     I am perfectly content to accept whatever my fortune may be,\r\n     confident that He who noteth even the fall of a sparrow will\r\n     have some purpose even in the fate of one like me.\r\n\r\n     My darling and ever-loved parents, good-bye. God bless,\r\n     protect and care for you. ELMER.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n     My own darling Kitty. My Regiment is ordered to cross the\r\n     river & move on Alexandria within six hours. We may meet\r\n     with a warm reception & my darling among so many careless\r\n     fellows one is somewhat likely to be hit.\r\n\r\n     If anything _should_ happen--Darling just accept this\r\n     assurance, the only thing I can leave you--The highest\r\n     happiness I looked for on earth was a union with you--You\r\n     have more than realised the hopes I formed regarding your\r\n     advancement--And I believe I love you with all the ardor I\r\n     am capable of--You know my darling any attempt of mine to\r\n     convey an adequate expression of my feelings must be simply\r\n     futile--God bless you, as you deserve and grant you a happy\r\n     & usefull life & us a union hereafter. Truly your own,\r\n     ELMER.\r\n\r\n     P. S.\r\n\r\n     Give my love to mother & father (such they truly were to me)\r\n     and thank them again for all their kindness to me--I regret\r\n     I can make no better return for it--Again Good bye. God\r\n     bless you my own darling.\r\n\r\n                                                     ELMER.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: COLONEL ELLSWORTH’S LAST LETTER\r\n   Reproduced by courtesy of Mrs. Charles H. Godfrey, Rockford,\r\n   Illinois]\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful moonlight night and the bayonets of the troops\r\ncould be seen glittering as they crossed the Long and Georgetown\r\nbridges for the invasion of Virginia. The regiment arrived at\r\nAlexandria, seven miles below, at sunrise, disembarked unopposed,\r\nformed near the wharf, and Colonel Ellsworth with a squad of men from\r\nCompany “A” started at “double quick” into the city, intending to\r\nseize the telegraph office and dispatches. Observing the Confederate\r\nflag flying from the roof of the Marshall House, he sent a sergeant\r\nwith an order for Company “A” to come up at once. It was evidently his\r\npurpose to detail the company to remove the flag, for he then passed\r\non; but, as if reconsidering, turned and entered the hotel. It should\r\nbe stated here that the regiment had come to Alexandria under\r\nembarrassing circumstances; for not only had certain of the citizens\r\nexpressed a desire that they should not be sent to the town, but\r\nGeneral Mansfield, commanding at Washington, had threatened to muster\r\nthem out of the service should they not conduct themselves in an\r\norderly manner. This partially explains Colonel Ellsworth’s desire to\r\nobtain the flag without delay, fearing that it might enrage the men\r\nand lead to acts of vandalism. On the other hand, it is affirmed that\r\nbefore he left New York with his regiment, he remarked that “he would\r\nbring to the city the first secession flag he might encounter,” and\r\nthat “he would not order any of his men to go where he would not go\r\nhimself.” Just what was in the young colonel’s mind will never be\r\nknown; probably a variety of motives impelled him to the act. He knew\r\nthat the city of Washington would be looking for the lowering of the\r\n“bastard flag,” which for days had been flaunted as an insult and\r\nchallenge to the capital city. President Lincoln at that very moment\r\nmight be looking anxiously from the windows of the White House for its\r\ndisappearance!\r\n\r\nThe Marshall House is an old landmark of Alexandria, constructed of\r\nbrick and three stories high; it was famous as having entertained\r\nWashington. The flag was flying from a staff about twenty-five feet in\r\nlength, attached to the frame of a rear dormer window, and was reached\r\nby ascending to the attic by a stairway which had a landing and turn\r\nat the middle. Colonel Ellsworth and his party, having left guards at\r\nproper intervals, secured the flag, and were coming down from the\r\nattic, when Corporal Francis E. Brownell, who was ahead, observed a\r\nman with a gun, who proved to be James W. Jackson, proprietor of the\r\nhouse, standing at the foot of the stairs. He immediately sprang\r\nbelow, and struck down the weapon but before he could prevent him\r\nJackson raised his gun, a double-barrel shotgun, and fired at Colonel\r\nEllsworth, who had come onto the middle landing and taken a step or\r\ntwo down, the charge entering his left breast. The Colonel cried “My\r\nGod!” and plunged headlong to the floor below, uttering soon after but\r\na low moan. He fell near the room that had been occupied by\r\nWashington, and the medal he wore, inscribed, “Non nobis, sed pro\r\npatria,” was wet with his blood. Brownell with great coolness and\r\nrapidity of action took aim and firing struck Jackson in the middle of\r\nthe face and as he reeled to fall plunged his sword bayonet through\r\nhim, the assassin’s second shot flying harmlessly over Brownell’s\r\nhead. A scene of confusion followed the double tragedy, heart-rending\r\ncries of agony, as Jackson’s wife bewailed her loss, resounded through\r\nthe hotel, while the Zouaves, fearing that they were trapped in a nest\r\nof secessionists, posted themselves so as to command the corridors and\r\nordered all guests into their rooms on peril of being shot down.\r\nCompany “A” soon arrived on the ground, however, and on a litter\r\nimprovised out of muskets, the body of Ellsworth was borne to the\r\nriver, placed on the _James Guy_, and conveyed immediately to\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nAmong the many tributes that were published in honor of Ellsworth,\r\nnone were comparable to the beautiful words sent by President Lincoln\r\nto his parents. He wrote:[131]\r\n\r\n     “In the untimely loss of your noble son, our affliction here\r\n     is scarcely less than your own. So much of promised\r\n     usefulness to one’s country, and of bright hopes for one’s\r\n     self and friends, have rarely been so suddenly darkened as\r\n     in his fall. In size, in years, and in youthful appearance,\r\n     a boy only, his power to command men, was surpassingly\r\n     great. This power, combined with a fine intellect, and\r\n     indomitable energy, and a taste altogether military,\r\n     constituted in him, as seemed to me, the best natural\r\n     talent, in that department, I ever knew. And yet he was\r\n     singularly modest and deferential in social intercourse. My\r\n     acquaintance with him began less than two years ago; yet\r\n     through the latter half of the intervening period, it was as\r\n     intimate as the disparity of our ages, and my engrossing\r\n     engagements, would permit. To me, he appeared to have no\r\n     indulgences or pastimes; and I never heard him utter a\r\n     profane or an intemperate word. What was conclusive of his\r\n     good heart, he never forgot his parents. The honors he\r\n     labored for so laudably, and, in the sad end, so gallantly\r\n     gave his life, he meant for them, no less than for himself.\r\n\r\n     “In the hope that it may be no intrusion upon the sacredness\r\n     of your sorrow, I have ventured to address you this tribute\r\n     to the memory of my young friend, and your brave and early\r\n     fallen child.\r\n\r\n     “May God give you the consolation which is beyond all\r\n     earthly power.\r\n\r\n     “Sincerely your friend in common affliction.\r\n\r\n                                               A. LINCOLN.”\r\n\r\nImportunate words throng me for expression, but they cannot be\r\naccommodated further; the rage and grief of the Fire Zouaves and their\r\nhardly-prevented purpose of burning the city of Alexandria; the\r\nuniversal sorrow and demonstrations of grief all along the funeral\r\nroute from Washington to Mechanicsville. I would like to tell of my\r\nacquaintance with and reminiscences of Ellsworth’s parents, of how the\r\ngovernment provided liberally for them, of how their son Elmer\r\nfulfilled in death the desire that he had been unable to accomplish in\r\nlife: that his mother might “ride in a carriage.”\r\n\r\nThe fame of Ellsworth is destined to live on and to increase, for he\r\nindividualized those elements of character which are loved and admired\r\nby the race universally. There was a deep well of patriotism in his\r\nromantic, generous nature, informed and directed by a keen and\r\ncomprehensive intellect. Though his life is almost like a fairy tale,\r\nit is steadied and rationalized by deep thoughtfulness, filial\r\naffection, and unaffected piety. The far generations will linger\r\nreverently over that final word of love to his parents and will shed a\r\ntear as they read of his last look at the portrait of the bride of his\r\nheart and of his going out to die. Ellsworth will yet come to his own\r\nand be appreciated and valued and loved for what he was: one of the\r\nnoblest, purest, and ablest patriots who ever died for his country.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [128] This article, which is intended to serve as an\r\n     introduction to a biography of Colonel Ellsworth which I\r\n     hope to bring out, comprises but a fraction of the data\r\n     bearing upon his life and times which I have in my\r\n     possession. To those who have afforded me assistance in the\r\n     collection of this material I am deeply grateful; in\r\n     particular I desire to express my indebtedness to the\r\n     following persons: Milo M.

However this may be, it was given, upon his death,\r\n     to Corporal Brownell, who had killed Jackson, his assassin.\r\n     John Hay seems to have had access to it at one time, for in\r\n     an article by him in _McClure’s Magazine_, VI, 354, many\r\n     citations from the diary are given. Prior to this, an\r\n     unidentified writer in the Chicago _Times_ of October 28,\r\n     1883, and in the _National Tribune_ of October 15, 1885\r\n     cites so extensively from Ellsworth’s diary as to render it\r\n     probable that he had possession of it either at that or at\r\n     some prior time.\r\n\r\n     [130] The letter to Miss Spafford is owned by her sister,\r\n     Mrs. Charles H.

In the _Wisconsin Banner_, the first German newspaper in\r\nthe state, was printed on March 20, 1847, a metrical argument of 168\r\nlines in favor of “Die Constitution.” The recent posture of public\r\naffairs seems to render apposite the reprinting of a portion of this\r\npoem, which affords a fair idea of the attitude of Wisconsin Germans\r\nof the forties toward certain questions which the whirligig of time\r\nhas again brought to the fore. We print the selection in the original\r\nGerman and in English translation. For making the latter,\r\nacknowledgement is due Dr. Charles Giessing, of Princeton, formerly of\r\nthe University of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n      “Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?\r\n      Wo Eide schwört ein Druck der Hand!\r\n      Wo Treue hell vom Auge blitzt,\r\n      Und Liebe warm im Herzen sitzt!”\r\n  So sang ein Mann im Hochgefühl der Kraft,\r\n  Der hat kein Herz, den dieses Lügen straft.\r\n  Was treibt den Deutschen über Land und Meere?\r\n  Sagt, warum kämpft er für die Union?\r\n  Stirbt auf dem Feld des Ruhmes und der Ehre,\r\n  Für Freiheit und für diese Nation?\r\n  Braust nicht der Rhein, der freie deutsche Rhein?\r\n  Was treibt ihn fort vom heimathlichen Herde?\r\n  Stösst man ihn aus dem Vaterlande?--Nein!\r\n  Dort, dort geht er einher mit krummem Rücken.\r\n  Der Deutsche ist zur Langmuth so geneigt:\r\n  Wer leben will, so heisst es, muss sich bücken.\r\n  Halt’s Maul, ich will Ihn lehren, dass er [Er] schweigt!\r\n  In Fesseln wird der freie Geist gebunden,\r\n  Er darf nicht reden, was er ausgedacht,\r\n  Die Seele wird ihm aus dem Leib geschunden,\r\n  Wenn sein beleidigtes Gefühl erwacht.\r\n  Man betet in Egypten heut’ger Tage\r\n  Die Kühe und die Zwiebeln an,\r\n  Allein, bei Gott! den deutschen Mann,\r\n  Den sehr Betrognen, treffe unsre Klage,\r\n  Der sich so weit, so weit vergehen kann,\r\n  Und stösst das Recht zurück, das ihm gegeben\r\n  Zu einem freien, selbstbewussten Leben.\r\n\r\n     “Where is the German Fatherland?\r\n      Where oaths are sworn by grasp of hand!\r\n      Where loyalty gleams from the eye,\r\n      And warm love makes the heart beat high.”\r\n  Thus sang a man sure of his pow’r and youth,\r\n  He has no heart who contradicts its truth.\r\n  What drives the German over sea and land,\r\n  What force is it that makes the Union dear,\r\n  That on the battle-field he takes his stand\r\n  To die for liberty, and for this nation here?\r\n  Does not the Rhine, free German Rhine still roar,\r\n  What drives him forth from hearth and home?\r\n  Perchance he’s banished?--Nevermore!\r\n  In yonder land stooped o’er a crutch they walk\r\n  (The Germans are too supple in their will),\r\n  “Who wants to live,” they’re told, “bend to the yoke!\r\n  Shut up!

The coming of the troops was awaited with\r\napprehension; the majority of the townspeople considered their\r\npresence as a personal affront. However, the soldiers were disembarked\r\nat the long wharf and marched to the Common without any hostile\r\ndemonstration on the part of the populace. The soldiers soon settled\r\nin barracks and entered upon a period of dull inactivity, broken only\r\nby occasional clashes with the rougher elements of the town’s\r\npopulation. After a year had passed away two of the four regiments\r\nwere withdrawn, leaving the Fourteenth and the Twenty-ninth, which,\r\nafter the events of the massacre, were nicknamed the “Sam Adams\r\nregiments.”\r\n\r\nIn the strained relations between the colonial authorities and the\r\nhome government, the presence of the troops in Boston acted as a\r\nconstant irritant. The ruder class of the town’s population, sailors,\r\nropemakers, and apprentice lads, were imbued with the sentiments of\r\nthe patriotic party, but lacked the restraint and self-control that\r\nmarked its leaders. The soldiers became a constant butt for the rough\r\nwitticisms of the lower town element; they were taunted with the\r\nepithets of “bloody-backs” and “lobsters” in derision of their\r\nuniform. They were constantly dared to fight, and continually reminded\r\nof the restriction that forbade a movement of aggression without the\r\norders of a civil magistrate. Several times individual soldiers were\r\nprovoked into fisticuff contests, and frequently came off second best\r\nin such encounters with the town roughs. Upon the whole, the troops\r\nshowed commendable restraint, and, in spite of the bad blood between\r\nthem and the populace, for nearly two years no open clash took place.\r\n\r\nOn the night of March 5, 1770, an incident occurred which, trivial in\r\nitself, led to momentous consequences. A guard stationed at the Custom\r\nHouse in King’s Square was set upon by a crowd of roughs, and\r\nassaulted with a volley of snowballs. Summoning assistance, the single\r\nsoldier was reënforced by a squad of six under command of Captain\r\nThomas Preston. The town crowd, instead of dispersing, continued its\r\ninsults, while its number was constantly swelled by fresh recruits.\r\nDuring the excitement someone rang the town fire bell, and the\r\nsurrounding populace poured into the square to witness the nonexistent\r\nconflagration. The restraint of the troops reached the breaking point.\r\nIn the mêlée an order to fire was believed to have been heard. The\r\nsoldiers leveled their fusees and fired into the crowd, the first\r\nvolley killing four bystanders and wounding several more. Aghast at\r\nthe consequences of their act, the offending squad withdrew to the\r\nnear-by barracks, leaving the “town-born” to bear away their dead and\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nThe excitement in the city grew apace throughout the hours of the\r\nnight. The townspeople gathered in the streets, while as the news\r\nspread abroad hundreds flocked in from the countryside. The town\r\ncommittee met at once, and demanded of the governor that the troops be\r\nremoved to the castle in the harbor. After much hesitation and\r\nparleying on the part of the authorities, the request was granted, and\r\norders were reluctantly given to evacuate the city barracks. Preston\r\nand his firing squad were arrested and placed in the town gaol. The\r\nexasperation and resentment of the populace threatened dire\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nOn March 8 occurred the public funeral of the victims, and the\r\npassions of the townspeople were fanned to a still hotter flame; it\r\nwas said that fifteen thousand people followed the four coffins to\r\ntheir last resting place, and that threats of vengeance were openly\r\nexpressed. The trial for murder of Preston and the soldiers in the\r\ncolony’s civil courts soon followed. Excitement against the accused\r\nran high. Nevertheless, to the honor of Massachusetts the indicted\r\nwere given a fair trial, while two of the colony’s ablest advocates,\r\nJohn Adams and Josiah Quincy, Jr., offered at the risk of their\r\nreputations and popularity to defend the accused. Under these\r\ncircumstances Preston and all but two of the soldiers were acquitted.\r\nThe latter received a light sentence for manslaughter.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the town committee, fearing the adverse effect of this\r\nincident upon the British authorities, and dreading the probable\r\nmisrepresentation of the facts before the British public, prepared a\r\ndefense of the colony’s position which they published in a pamphlet\r\nentitled: _A Short Narrative of the horrid Massacre in Boston,\r\nPerpetrated in the Evening of the Fifth Day of March, 1770. By\r\nSoldiers of the XXIXth Regiment; which with the XIVth Regiment Were\r\nthen Quartered there: with some Observations on the state of things\r\nprior to that Catastrophe._ Printed by Order of the Town of BOSTON,\r\nand Sold by EDES and GILL in Queen-Street And T. & J. FLEET in\r\nCornhill, 1770.\r\n\r\nAttached to this pamphlet was a folded plate, which, according to an\r\ninscription in the lower right-hand corner was “Engraved Printed &\r\nSold by PAUL REVERE BOSTON.” Recently Mr. Frank J. Wilder, of Boston,\r\na member of the State Historical Society, presented to its Library one\r\nof the early reproductions, now become rare, of this celebrated\r\nengraving. The receipt of this interesting gift, which now hangs in\r\nthe military history room of the Museum, has directed attention to the\r\nhistory of the print, which proves to be of no less interest than is\r\nthe print itself.\r\n\r\nPaul Revere, later so prominently associated with the first struggle\r\nof the Revolutionary War, was of Huguenot descent, a native of Boston,\r\nand had for some time served the colony as a gold- and silversmith.\r\nHis first efforts at engraving were confined to silver plate; later he\r\nbegan to produce engravings drawn on copper plates and printed on\r\npaper. One of the earliest of these productions was a view of Boston\r\nshowing the disembarkation of the troops. Revere was an ardent\r\npatriot, and in all probability formed one of the crowd of spectators\r\nin King Street Square when the soldiers fired upon the populace. In\r\nthe Boston Public Library is still preserved a sketch by his hand of\r\nthe site of the massacre, with indications on the diagram showing\r\nwhere the victims fell. This drawing was no doubt used during the\r\ntrial of Captain Preston and his soldiers.\r\n\r\nRevere was likewise in close personal relations with Edes and Gill,\r\nthe publishers of the exculpatory pamphlet, and he often prepared wood\r\ncuts for the paper they issued, the Boston _Gazette and Country\r\nJournal_. An interesting illustration of his work appears in the issue\r\nof this journal for March 12, 1770, where above the column devoted to\r\nan account of the public funeral of the victims appear four miniature\r\nblack coffins. That these were the work of Revere we learn from an old\r\naccount book, found among his papers, wherein, under the entry for\r\nMarch 9, is a charge to Edes and Gill of six shillings for “Engraving\r\n5 Coffings for Massacre,” while pinned to the page is a paper pattern\r\nthe size and shape of the tiny coffins appearing in the newspaper. The\r\nState Historical Society of Wisconsin possesses a copy of this old\r\njournal, and there may be seen the heavily black-leaded page, on which\r\nmourning is displayed for the Boston dead, and the prints of the\r\n“coffings” engraved by Revere, on each of which is cut a skull and\r\ncrossbones over the initials of the victim. On that of the youngest of\r\nthe four appear the words: “Ae. 17,” with a scythe and hourglass\r\nindicative of his having been cut off in the flower of youth. On the\r\nsame page with the account of the tragedy and the funeral occurs the\r\nfollowing interesting letter from Captain Preston:\r\n\r\n                           BOSTON-GAOL, Monday, 12th March, 1770.\r\n\r\n     Messieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\n     Permit me thro’ the Channel of your Paper, to return my\r\n     Thanks in the most Publick Manner to the Inhabitants of this\r\n     Town--who throwing aside all Party and Prejudice, have with\r\n     the utmost Humanity and Freedom stept forth Advocates for\r\n     Truth, in Defence of my injured Innocence, in the late\r\n     unhappy Affair that happened on Monday Night last: And to\r\n     assure them, that I shall ever have the highest Sense of the\r\n     Justice they have done me, which will be ever gratefully\r\n     remembered, by\r\n\r\n     Their much obliged and most obedient humble Servant,\r\n\r\n                                            THOMAS PRESTON.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the picture which Paul Revere prepared to be\r\npresented, with the official pamphlet, to the view of the British\r\npublic in order to affect its opinion of the action of the troops. The\r\nengraving is 8½ by 9¾ inches in size, and is colored by hand in red,\r\nblue, green, and brown. In the background is the Boston town hall, now\r\nknown as the “Old State House,” with its graceful clock-tower rising\r\ninto a pale blue sky. At the upper left hand is a chubby,\r\ncheerful-looking crescent moon. The public square is framed on both\r\nsides by its enclosing buildings, over the portal of one of which, at\r\nthe right, is the inscription “G R (for Georgius Rex) Custom House.”\r\nHigher still, along the entire façade of the building stretches the\r\nimaginary and ironical designation “Butcher’s Hall.”\r\n\r\nIn the foreground of the picture, and in front of the Custom House\r\nstands in a menacing attitude the file of soldiers, very red of coats\r\nand black of boots. Each has his gun outstretched with its bayonet\r\npointing to the crowd, while the clouds of smoke that roll around and\r\nbehind the figures testify that the guns have just been discharged\r\namong the unhappy bystanders. At the extreme right of the line of\r\nsoldiers stands Captain Preston with uplifted, menacing sword.\r\nOpposite the firing squad is the crowd of citizens, some of whom have\r\nfallen to the ground, or are being supported in the arms of their\r\ncomrades. From the breasts and temples of the wounded streams of blood\r\npour forth and dye the pavement roundabout. The crowd is in great\r\nagitation. One venturesome townsman lifts his hand as though he would\r\npush back an advancing bayonet. Another clasps his hands in horror to\r\nhis breast. Some of the bystanders have turned as if to flee, but most\r\nof them are engaged in succoring their wounded comrades. One man in\r\nbrown coat and green vest is being tenderly lifted by two friends; his\r\nhead falls helplessly to one side while a bright red jet of blood\r\npours from his breast over the green waistcoat. One of the victims\r\nlies on his back, his head drawn up as if he were in agony, one hand\r\nclasps his breast, from a wound in which a crimson stream flows forth.\r\nThe boy victim lies motionless on the ground, a pool of blood from his\r\nforehead dyeing the pavement near his head. In front of this whole\r\ngroup stands a composed, indifferent-looking dog, quite unmoved by the\r\ntragic scene behind him. The quaint costumes and stiff attitudes of\r\nthe actors in the picture, the shapeless, ill-drawn legs of the\r\nsoldiers, and the stolid, expressionless faces of the participants\r\nindicate that the engraver was a tyro in his art. To the observer,\r\nhowever, these defects in some measure enhance the interest of the\r\npicture and give it the charm peculiar to primitive productions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAUL REVERE PRINT OF THE BOSTON MASSACRE]\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions above and below the print add to its intrinsic\r\ninterest. The passionate appeal for sympathy for the slain made by\r\nthese inscriptions indicates the depths of feeling aroused by the\r\nmassacre. Across the top is printed, “The BLOODY MASSACRE perpetrated\r\nin King Street BOSTON on March 5th 1770 by a party of the 29{th}\r\nREGT.” Underneath the picture is the following remarkable effusion,\r\nprobably from the pen of Paul Revere himself, who frequently indulged\r\nin such attempts at literary effort:\r\n\r\n  Unhappy BOSTON! See thy Sons deplore.\r\n  Thy hallow’d Walks besmear’d with guiltless Gore.\r\n  While faithless P----n [Preston] and his savage Bands,\r\n  With murd’rous Rancour stretch their bloody Hands;\r\n  Like fierce Barbarians grinning o’er their Prey,\r\n  Approve the Carnage, and enjoy the Day.\r\n  If scalding drops from Rage from Anguish Wrung\r\n  If speechless Sorrows lab’ring for a Tongue,\r\n  Or if a weeping World can aught appease\r\n  The plaintive Ghosts of Victims such as these;\r\n  The Patriot’s copious Tears for each are shed,\r\n  A glorious Tribute which embalms the Dead.\r\n  But know FATE summons to that awful Goal\r\n  Where JUSTICE strips the Murd’rer of his Soul;\r\n  Should venal C----ts the scandal of the Land,\r\n  Snatch the relentless Villain from her Hand,\r\n  Keen Execrations on this Plate inscrib’d,\r\n  Shall reach a JUDGE who never can be brib’d.\r\n\r\n_The unhappy Sufferers were Messs_ SAML GRAY, SAML MAVERICK, JAMS\r\nCALDWELL, CRISPUS ATTUCKS & PATK CARR _killed. Six wounded_; two of\r\nthem (CHRISTR MONK & JOHN CLARK) _Mortally_.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred copies of the pamphlet were issued in the first\r\nedition, and for his work upon the plate the Revere papers tell\r\nus that the engraver received five pounds. A number of variants\r\nof the original plate appeared within a few months of its\r\nproduction. One was reduced in size to accompany an octavo\r\nedition of the pamphlet. This latter engraving was 4½ by 6⅝\r\ninches. It had no inscription at the top but underneath bore the\r\nfollowing words: “The Massacre perpetrated in King Street on\r\nMarch 5{th} 1770, in which Mess{rs} Saml Gray, Saml Maverick,\r\nJames Caldwell, Crispus Attucks Patrick Carr were Killed, six\r\nothers Wounded two of them Mortally.” The different proportions\r\nof this plate give to the picture more sky and foreground than\r\nthe one we have described above. The second edition of the\r\npamphlet with the smaller engraving was reprinted without change\r\nin London by E. & C. Dilly and J. Almon in the same year that the\r\n_Short Narrative_ appeared in Boston.\r\n\r\nTwo other London editions of the pamphlet were issued the same\r\nyear by the publishing firm of W. Bingley in Newgate Street. One\r\nof these has for its frontispiece an engraving 8½ by 12 inches in\r\nsize, with the following inscription across the top: “The Fruits\r\nof Arbitrary Power; or the Bloody Massacre, Perpetrated in King\r\nStreet, Boston by a Party of the XXIX Regt.” Underneath is\r\nprinted Revere’s original poem, without the accompanying names of\r\nthe victims. On the left of the poem the following verse is\r\nsurmounted by a skull and crossbones within a wreath: “How long\r\nshall they utter and speak hard things? And all the workers of\r\niniquity boast themselves? They break in pieces thy people, O\r\nLord, and afflict thine heritage. Ps. XCIV, 4, 5.” On the right\r\nof the poem appears the design of a liberty cap in clouds from\r\nwhich issue forks of lightning and two broken swords. Underneath\r\nis printed, “They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the\r\nfatherless. Yet they say, The Lord shall not see, neither shall\r\nthe God of Jacob regard it. Ps. XCIV, 6, 7.” Some of these prints\r\nhave been found with only the two devices and without the\r\nscriptural quotations.\r\n\r\nStill one more print appeared in London in 1770 which shows\r\nmarked variations from all those previously described. These were\r\nall variants of Revere’s original plate, and differ only in size,\r\nproportions, and inscriptions. The print which we now describe is\r\nso different in composition and so much better in execution that\r\nit would seem to be the work of another artist than Revere. Not\r\nonly are the proportions of the picture changed, but the handling\r\nof the perspective is much better, the drawing of the figures,\r\nand the expression of the faces show the handiwork of a genuine\r\nartist. The arrangement of the figures is the same, but the\r\nsoldiers’ legs become quite possible members of their bodies,\r\nable to bear a man’s weight. The fallen figures lie in better and\r\neasier attitudes. The grouping of the crowd is less confused, and\r\nin the background appear the heads of two women wearing bonnets,\r\nthat are not seen in the original Revere prints. Moreover, there\r\nis no dog in the foreground and no moon in the sky of this latter\r\nprint. The question arises whether some other artist adapted\r\nRevere’s composition, materially improving it in so doing, or\r\nwhether Revere himself secured his suggestions for his work from\r\nthe author of this latter print. This is answered by a letter\r\nfound some years since among the Pelham-Copley papers in the\r\nBritish Public Record Office and printed by the Massachusetts\r\nHistorical Society in one of its recent volumes of _Collections_.\r\n\r\nHenry Pelham was a young half brother of the famous colonial\r\nartist Copley, and the original of the latter’s lovely picture,\r\n“The Boy with a Squirrel.” Young Pelham lived in a family of\r\nartists and himself early displayed considerable talent. He\r\nlearned engraving from his father Peter Pelham, one of Boston’s\r\nearliest engravers. The following letter was written by the\r\nyounger Pelham to Paul Revere:\r\n\r\n                         Thursday Morng. Boston, March 29, 1770.\r\n\r\n     Sir,\r\n\r\n     When I heard that you was cutting a plate of the late\r\n     Murder. I thought it impossible, as I knew you was not\r\n     capable of doing it unless you coppied it from mine and as I\r\n     thought I had entrusted it in the hands of a person who had\r\n     more regard to the dictates of Honour and Justice than to\r\n     take the undue advantage you have done of the confidence and\r\n     Trust I reposed in you. But I find I was mistaken, and after\r\n     being at the great Trouble and Expence of making a design\r\n     paying for paper, printing &c, find myself in the most\r\n     ungenerous Manner deprived, not only of any proposed\r\n     Advantage, but even of the expence I have been at, as truly\r\n     as if you had plundered me on the highway. It you are\r\n     insensible of the Dishonour you have brought on yourself by\r\n     this Act, the World will not be so. However, I leave you to\r\n     reflect upon and consider of one of the most dishonorable\r\n     Actions you could well be guilty of.\r\n\r\n                                                 H. PELHAM.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any defense by Paul Revere, and in the presence of\r\nthe better engraving made along the lines and with the same general\r\narrangement as that claimed by Revere, it would seem that we must\r\nconvict the latter of the plagiarism with which Pelham charged him.\r\nSome of the latter’s prints were issued, since among his papers is the\r\ncharge in March, 1770, of three pounds nine shillings by one Daniel\r\nRea “To printing 575 of your Prints @ 12| Pr. Hund.” Pelham was a much\r\nabler artist than Revere; moreover, it should be noted that the latter\r\nprints upon his engraving only the words, “engraved, printed, and sold\r\nby Paul Revere,” all of which might have been the literal truth, had\r\nhe utilized the design of the younger artist. None the less his\r\nappropriation without compensation of his young neighbor’s design is\r\nmuch to his discredit, and detracts from the interest and enjoyment\r\nwith which we examine this most famous and interesting of Paul\r\nRevere’s engravings.\r\n\r\nThe vogue for this picture of the massacre has been very great from\r\nthe time of its first printing until the present. We have seen how\r\nmany editions appeared in 1770. These spread rapidly throughout all\r\nthe English colonies in America. So popular did the prints become that\r\nas early as 1785 a new edition became necessary, while the original\r\nprints were much in demand, and formed part of early collections of\r\nAmericana. Originals of 1770 are now so highly prized that single\r\ncopies sell for anywhere from $750 to $1,000. In 1832 an excellent\r\nreproduction was issued, which has in its turn become rare enough to\r\ncommand $50 upon the market.\r\n\r\nHow much the publication of the original prints had to do with the\r\nprofound sensation that the “Boston Massacre” awakened everywhere\r\namong the American colonies we have no means of judging. Certainly the\r\nrepresentation was calculated to arouse intense resentment against the\r\nBritish soldiery, and this feeling may have contributed to the\r\nalacrity with which the colonists took up arms in defense of their\r\nliberty. From a trivial encounter between imperial troops and the\r\nBoston mob, the incident arose to a position of international\r\nimportance. Its pictorial presentation, therefore, has become a part\r\nof our national history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME LETTERS OF PAUL O. HUSTING CONCERNING THE PRESENT CRISIS\r\n\r\nThe advent of the world struggle which still rages between the forces\r\nof autocracy and democracy found our nation as a whole, and many of us\r\nas individuals, unprepared to meet the new conditions and to withstand\r\nthe test of the new issues with which we were confronted. But it did\r\nnot find the mind of Paul Husting wanting in the needful qualities of\r\nintellect, or his soul in those of courage.\r\n\r\nIn the brief period of service as senator from Wisconsin he revealed\r\nhimself as one of Wisconsin’s greatest sons, and his untimely death in\r\nOctober, 1917, was a genuine calamity both to state and to nation in\r\ntheir hour of trial and danger. Not often does the opportunity occur\r\nto a historical journal to publish documents fraught at the same time\r\nwith a high degree of historical value and of interest for their\r\nbearing on issues still current. Such an opportunity, we think, is\r\nafforded the WISCONSIN MAGAZINE OF HISTORY in connection with the\r\ndocuments which follow. The letters speak for themselves and aside\r\nfrom certain minor typographical corrections we present them unedited.\r\nHowever, we cannot refrain, in concluding this introductory note, from\r\ncalling the reader’s attention to the significance of the dates of the\r\nseveral letters: the first, following the sinking of the _Lusitania_;\r\nthe second, at the time the embargo-on-munitions discussion was rife;\r\nthe third, following our entrance into the world war.\r\n\r\n                                   Mayville, Wis., May 14, 1915.\r\n\r\n  ---- ----,\r\n  ----, Wis.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour letter of May 10th, enclosing clipping from a Chilton newspaper,\r\nwas duly received and read. The clipping which you have enclosed\r\nentitled “The United States, an Ally of England against Germany and\r\nAustria-Hungary” is a very coarse and vituperative and un-American\r\nattack on President Wilson and his administration. In this article,\r\nthe President in substance and effect is portrayed as a weakling, a\r\ntool of England, a hypocrite, who pretends to be what he is not, and\r\nwith sanctimonious phrase is trying to mislead the people. The\r\nadministration is charged with being in a secret pact with England\r\nagainst Germany and winds up with asking the people of this country\r\nhow long they are going to stand the disgrace of having such a\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that I have the honor of your acquaintance but,\r\nnevertheless, I feel that the article sent me and your letter should\r\nbe replied to because there are other papers and other men engaged in\r\ncarrying out this sort of propaganda.\r\n\r\nThere are, I know, a number of good and patriotic citizens of this\r\ncountry, who, because of lack of information, and because of their\r\nintense sympathy for relatives and friends now fighting in the old\r\ncountry, have permitted themselves to be misled in the belief that\r\nthis country has unjustly, and, contrary to the laws of nations,\r\npermitted the shipment of munitions of war to European countries.\r\nThere are, however, also, a number of men and newspapers who are\r\nmerely repeating and spreading a propaganda originating in the old\r\ncountry with a design and purpose to weaken their own government and\r\naid and strengthen one of the belligerent nations. I hope that I am\r\naddressing you as one who may be put in the first class mentioned.\r\n\r\nYour criticism of President Wilson must be the result either of blind\r\npartisanship, of a lack of familiarity with the facts relating to our\r\npresent foreign relations, of a failure to fully comprehend the exact\r\nmeaning and difficulties of neutrality, or of a desire to plunge this\r\ncountry into [the] European embroglio without considering whether we\r\nhave any cause or excuse for entering that awful conflict.\r\nConsiderations of partisanship are so loathsome in times of great\r\nnational crises that I believe you incapable of entertaining such and\r\nI freely acquit you of such base motives. The high-minded attitude of\r\nformer President Taft ought to be sufficient to deter everyone from\r\nseeking to make political or partisan capital out of the present\r\ndelicate situation. I cannot conceive that you feel yourself in closer\r\nallegiance to Germany than you do to this nation, for then your words\r\nwould not be those of an American citizen but of one who is an alien,\r\nat least in thought, and not entitled to the protection or blessings\r\nof our free government. I assume that you are laboring under a\r\nmisconception of the facts and upon the assumption that you have been\r\nmisguided, I am writing you fully in reply to your letter.\r\n\r\nI find no fault with American citizens or American newspapers (in\r\nthis, of course, I include those printed in the German language) that\r\nsympathize with Germany as against England nor do I find any fault\r\nwith the criticism directed against England’s war policy or methods.\r\nOur government has repeatedly remonstrated and protested to England\r\nagainst the interference with our commerce with neutral countries, in\r\nthe shipment of non-contraband of war to belligerent countries, in the\r\nunlawful seizure of our vessels, and in the general interference with\r\nour rights as a neutral nation. I wish to add my objections and\r\nexpress my resentment against England for her studied and persistent\r\nviolations of many provisions of the international law. We have\r\nprotested and have done everything that we lawfully and justly could\r\ndo to support and maintain our rights, short of going to war. Withal,\r\nhowever, no American ships or lives have been lost as a result of\r\nEngland’s operations upon the sea and no passenger boat carrying\r\ncitizens of the United States has been sunk.\r\n\r\nIn the obstruction of our commerce and our dealings with foreign\r\nnations, Germany has gone as far as its ability permitted and is\r\ncertainly subject, in this respect, to the same criticism and\r\nresentment that we have directed against England. It seems that\r\nEngland and Germany in the operation of the war in retaliation and in\r\nreprisal have set aside the international code and are justifying\r\nanything and everything upon the ground or plea of necessity. So long\r\nas this mode of warfare is directed against one another of the\r\nbelligerent countries or their citizens, while we stand horrified and\r\nappalled, we may still have no just cause for interference. We have\r\nsuffered these inconveniences and losses to our business because not\r\nonly our government, but our people desire peace, and, furthermore,\r\nbecause we have no desire to interfere between the belligerent\r\ncountries. Now, while at most, Germany can only claim that, in respect\r\nto the hindrance to our commerce, she has done no worse than England,\r\nyet, in addition to this, ships flying the American flag have been\r\nassailed and sunk by her and American lives taken without\r\njustification and now the world is appalled by the destruction of over\r\n1,200 lives ruthlessly taken and men, women, and children have gone\r\ndown to their death defenseless and undefended.\r\n\r\nIt is no defense or justification of this act as against our country\r\nthat some other nation by its unlawful acts compelled the country at\r\nfault also to commit unlawful acts by way of reprisal.\r\n\r\nIt is no defense to say that American citizens who lost their lives\r\nwere warned and that they lost their lives through their own\r\ncontributory negligence. No warning to commit an unlawful act is a\r\ndefense or justification of such unlawful act. Such warning, in fact,\r\nnegatives the idea of accident and evidences premeditation and design\r\nto commit the unlawful act.\r\n\r\nWe know that the _Lusitania_ was sunk, that more than 100 American\r\nlives were lost, and we must hold the country directly responsible for\r\na deed which has shocked the civilized world and which appears to have\r\nbeen in violation of the law governing, and practices obtaining in,\r\ncivilized warfare. Notwithstanding the horror and resentment aroused\r\nin the public mind, our President is still striving to avert war!\r\n\r\nWhat would you now say if a German liner with Americans aboard had\r\nbeen sunk by an English torpedo under like circumstances and our\r\nPresident would not have counseled war against the offending country\r\nbut would still have stood for peace? Would you not have said then\r\nthat this country was favoring England and would you not have\r\nreiterated and repeated your slander that this country is an ally of\r\nEngland’s?\r\n\r\nIn the slanderous clipping sent me, it is charged that this country is\r\npretending neutrality when in fact, by not forbidding the shipment of\r\narms and munitions of war, we are violating the law of nations\r\ngoverning neutrals.\r\n\r\nThis slander against our country has been repeated over and over again\r\nby thoughtless men and by partisan newspapers. It originated across\r\nthe sea with those who well know the falsity and hypocrisy of the\r\ncharge and who have passed it on to a well-meaning and sympathetic,\r\nbut over-zealous and mistaken, people and press for the purpose of\r\naccomplishing a selfish end. This slander has been fostered and given\r\ncurrency also by some designing men and by some designing newspapers\r\nwho appear to have forgotten their duty to their country and who\r\nappear to be concerned more with the effect that the present war has\r\nupon some foreign country than with its effect upon our own country.\r\n\r\nThe laws of nations are the rules which determine the conduct of the\r\ngeneral body of civilized states in their dealings with one another.\r\nIts doctrines are founded on legal, not simply on ethical ideas; since\r\nthey purport to be rules of justice, not counsels of perfection, the\r\nforeign policies of a country are not founded upon feelings of moral\r\nrightness but upon precedents, treaties, and opinions of those\r\nrecognized as authority.\r\n\r\nInternational law is a part of the law of the land and, since the\r\ninterest of the United States with foreign nations and the policies in\r\nregard to them are placed by the Constitution in the hands of the\r\nfederal government, its decisions upon these subjects are _obligatory\r\nupon every citizen_.\r\n\r\nThe above are some of the elementary principles of international law.\r\nThese nations which are protected by these provisions also are subject\r\nto corresponding duties and obligations. Those which invoke the law\r\nmust obey the law. International law, being the joint product of\r\ncivilized nations, adopted and made by the common and joint consent of\r\nnations, of course, can not be repealed or amended by any one nation\r\nbut only by the mutual consent of all countries. If it were otherwise,\r\neach country would make its own international law to be amended or\r\nrepealed at the will of such country and thus would have no effect\r\neither upon itself or any other nation.\r\n\r\nNow we have an international law and its provisions are well defined\r\nand recognized. Now is there any provision in this law which forbids\r\nor makes unlawful the shipment of arms by citizens of a neutral\r\ncountry to a belligerent country or which gives a neutral country the\r\nprivilege to forbid such shipment? No. Then why not? Because it has\r\nbeen the law since civilization began for citizens of neutral\r\ncountries to engage in commerce as they chose and at their risk,\r\nsubject only to the right of belligerents to intercept and seize\r\ncontraband of war in transit to a belligerent enemy. In all the wars\r\nin which this country has been engaged, the citizens of the countries\r\nnow warring in Europe have recognized and countenanced this practice\r\nof selling arms to our enemy while we were at war and we have neither\r\nprotested nor complained against it, fully recognizing that the\r\ncitizens of such countries were entirely within their rights, that we\r\nhad no just cause for complaint. We recognized that it would have been\r\na violation of international law if at that time the said countries\r\nhad prohibited the shipment of munitions of war with a purpose clearly\r\nmanifested to aid or benefit either ourselves or our enemy.\r\n\r\nFor scores of years those countries now engaged in the European war\r\nhave been arming themselves and fortifying their country with the\r\npositive knowledge that sooner or later a conflict of the kind now\r\nraging would occur. England, France, and Russia did and so did Germany\r\nand Austria. They also well knew that, under the provisions of\r\ninternational law, the shipment of arms and munitions of war was\r\npermissible subject to the interception and seizure of them by\r\nbelligerent enemies. Long before this war, which they knew was\r\ninevitable, started Germany and Austria had the opportunity and the\r\ninfluence to have changed the international law and there is no doubt\r\nthat the United States would have joined them in this amendment.\r\nFar-seeing as its statesmen are and having well in mind the provisions\r\nof international law, yet, notwithstanding, Germany entered this war\r\nwith the law as it now stands.\r\n\r\nIf international law had, at the beginning of the present war,\r\nprohibited the shipment of munitions of war from this country and the\r\nUnited States nevertheless had violated the rule and permitted the\r\nshipment of munitions of war, _then_ it could be charged and convicted\r\nof a violation of the law and a breach of neutrality by the country\r\nadversely affected by such violation. Why? Because we would then have\r\nbeen guilty of an affirmative act unlawfully changing the established\r\nlaw to the injury and prejudice of a country with whom we are at peace\r\nwithout its consent. Such act would have been a breach of neutrality\r\nbecause, international law having been established by mutual consent,\r\nwe would have no right to repeal and amend that law without the\r\nconsent of those adversely affected by the change.\r\n\r\nNow to prohibit and prevent the shipment of munitions of war by an\r\naffirmative act on our part, at the behest and for the exclusive\r\nbenefit of one of the countries now at war, without the consent of the\r\nnations adversely affected thereby, would be a violation of\r\ninternational law and would constitute a breach of neutrality on our\r\npart which would be indefensible from the standpoint of good faith and\r\ngood friendship to all on our part. Now it must be remembered that the\r\nUnited States government is not engaged in the shipment of munitions\r\nof war to other countries. A good many misguided and uninformed people\r\nhave been led to believe that this country as a nation is thus\r\nengaged. It is true, that citizens of this country as a matter of\r\nbusiness are engaged in manufacturing and selling to individuals, from\r\nwhatever country they may come, munitions of war, as citizens of\r\nGermany, Austria, and other belligerent countries have done since time\r\nimmemorial. President Wilson has not approved such shipments. It is\r\nentirely probable that, from a moral standpoint, he abhors the\r\nmanufacture and sale of instruments and commodities to be used in the\r\nslaughter of human beings. He is a man of peace, and, if he had his\r\nway, wars in the future would be an impossibility.\r\n\r\nBut, as President of the United States,--a country which is in no\r\nsense responsible for this war--a country whose sole and passionate\r\ndesire is to keep out of this conflict--Woodrow Wilson must execute\r\nthe laws as he finds them and must maintain the neutrality of this\r\ncountry in accordance with the law of nations. This he has done\r\npatiently, persistently, and consistently, notwithstanding that blind\r\nand bitter partisanship, now on one side, now on the other, has done\r\nits best to shove him off his balance.\r\n\r\nPermit me to say that you, and men like you, and newspapers publishing\r\nlike articles commit a base and cruel slander on the President and on\r\nyour country when you state otherwise. This country, of all the\r\ncountries of the world, has kept its obligations and its poise.\r\n\r\nIn war-maddened Europe both England and Germany have attempted to\r\nannul the law to suit the exigencies of the moment. Our country,\r\nhowever, has contended, and, clearly within its rights, has demanded\r\nthe observance of the law of nations and has refused to recognize the\r\nright of the warring nations to annul or to amend the same to our\r\ndamage or in derogation of our rights.\r\n\r\nHow, then, in view of these facts, could we hold belligerents to their\r\nlawful duties if we were at the same time to violate the law and put\r\nourselves in the same class with them. But this is what you and other\r\ncritics ask this country to do. It is clear that you do not want this\r\ncountry to be neutral; you want it to take an affirmative and active\r\npart by governmental action to help one country and hurt another. Your\r\nand my government is endeavoring to maintain the status quo of a real\r\nneutrality. Those who are responsible for this movement which you\r\napprove of are endeavoring to shake and disturb it. Those who complain\r\nof our want of neutrality are complaining only because we have not\r\nbecome an ally of the country they favor.\r\n\r\nIf we listened to the insidious demands made by these countries that\r\nwould have us violate our lawful obligation to respect the law of\r\nnations by affirmatively aiding and assisting their side, would we not\r\nbe stopped from demanding reparation for the misconduct of the other\r\ncountries who have been prejudiced by our unlawful and unneutral act?\r\nAnd would not such a flagrant breach of international obligation on\r\nour part justify reprisals against us, or worse than that, probably\r\neventuate in a war with those countries who would thus be unlawfully\r\nand unfairly prejudiced by our act?\r\n\r\nThese countries who would have us place an embargo on arms and\r\nmunitions with an eye solely to their advantage might well favor an\r\nact on our part which would plunge us into war with their enemies and\r\nthus make us their own ally. From the standpoint of _their_ own\r\nmaterial advantage, and owing this country no duty whatever, it is\r\neasy to understand the motive back of their wishes.\r\n\r\nBut what motive, I ask, prompts you or any other American citizen who,\r\nowing a duty only to this country, should have in mind at all times\r\nprimarily the welfare of his own country, to aid and promote a foreign\r\npropaganda, which has for its object and end the plunging of this\r\ncountry into war with one side or the other.\r\n\r\nI say I acquit you of any base motive and can only believe that your\r\nutterances and your actions are the result of a want of information\r\nand understanding and not a willful desire on your part to injure the\r\ncountry which you are bound to support.\r\n\r\nYou could not be either misguided or mistaken, however, if you had not\r\nblindly accepted as true the statement of facts and the statement of\r\ninternational law as promulgated by a foreign government and its\r\nemissaries rather than the statements of fact and the statements of\r\nlaw promulgated by your own government. What right have you to doubt\r\nthe utterances of our President, who is serving this country with that\r\nsingleness of purpose which has always distinguished the acts of our\r\npresidents?\r\n\r\nWhat right have you to believe the utterances of emissaries, who have\r\nbeen sent from abroad with a singleness of purpose to serve their own\r\ngovernment at whatever cost to ours by sowing discord and falsehood\r\namong our people and who are trespassing upon our forbearance and are\r\nviolating obligations which we believe a visitor to our shores owes to\r\nour people?\r\n\r\nTo put it in another way, may I not ask you, as a citizen, what reason\r\nor right you have to believe or expect that a foreign country and its\r\nemissaries are safe advisers for the citizens of the United States to\r\nconsult or follow? And may I not also ask you, what there is in the\r\nlife of President Wilson as a man and his record as a president that\r\nwarrants you or any American citizen or newspaper in believing or\r\nasserting that he is not a man to believe or a safe president and\r\ncounselor to follow? These questions answer themselves.\r\n\r\nThis country is now confronted with a crisis. Notwithstanding the wave\r\nof popular indignation that has been aroused in this country, the\r\nPresident is straining every nerve to preserve peace and still\r\nmaintain the honor and dignity of this country. You, and others that\r\nhave been uttering the same charges that you have, have made the task\r\nmore difficult than it otherwise would be. There appears to be a\r\nfeeling in some foreign countries that our country is divided.\r\n\r\nA short while ago, a prominent citizen of a foreign country, whose\r\nutterances are recognized as semi-official, stated in substance that,\r\nwhile his country was a unit, that that was more than could be said of\r\nthe United States in all cases.\r\n\r\nIn the Milwaukee _Journal_ of Wednesday, May 12th, a translated\r\narticle from the Frankfurter _Zeitung_ was quoted as stating “that\r\nbecause of the fact that we have naturalized German citizens and a\r\nnumber of natural-born Americans of German descent that a war between\r\nthis country and Germany would be impossible because of the necessity\r\nof placing these citizens in the detention camp and that it would\r\nrequire our entire army to watch over them.”\r\n\r\nThese statements can only mean that the belief is entertained in that\r\ncountry that, in case of certain eventualities, this country would be\r\ndivided and that certain of our citizens would side with Germany\r\nagainst our government. Such a belief if indeed prevalent in that\r\ncountry is a serious obstacle to a peaceful termination of our\r\nnegotiations in the present crisis.\r\n\r\nBut to those of us who have read the history of the Revolutionary War,\r\nof the rebellion, and of every other war in which we have been engaged\r\nas a nation--those of us who love and admire our German friends and\r\nneighbors, who are familiar with their spirit of American citizenship\r\nand patriotism, who have lived amongst them and have felt and feel one\r\nwith them, know that these statements are unfounded and we resent them\r\nas a base calumny upon some of our most respected citizens. It is an\r\ninsult to American citizenship. It in effect amounts to a charge of\r\ndisloyalty and treason against some of our best citizens. Such a\r\nstatement should be publicly resented, however, first of all by those\r\nagainst whom this slander is directed, not because their loyalty and\r\npatriotism is doubted here, but because it is doubted elsewhere. It is\r\nnecessary for the world to understand and know that America is united\r\nas one man. This will do more to keep us out of war than all the\r\nclamor and all the pressure that can be brought to bear upon our\r\nPresident to abandon our neutrality and to violate our international\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nPermit me to say that in a time like this it is your duty and the duty\r\nof every citizen of the United States to stand loyally and\r\npatriotically back of our government. Not only as a matter of law is\r\nit your duty but from a natural sense of obligation as a citizen of a\r\ngreat nation, whose benefits and blessings you enjoy, and whose\r\nexistence you are at all hazards bound to preserve. We are fortunate\r\nindeed that we have a president like Woodrow Wilson at the head of our\r\naffairs at this time. A man less capable, less patriotic, less\r\nintelligent, less courageous might have precipitated us in the war\r\nbefore this. He is now standing four square to all the winds that\r\nblow, in an endeavor to preserve peace with honor, dignity, and safety\r\nto ourselves. Let all of us unite to do all we can to keep firm and\r\n[word illegible] any extreme and ill-considered speech.\r\n\r\nIn times like these, permit me to say that we should not only feel but\r\nact together. This is no time for petty partisanship or petty\r\npolitics. This is a time for deliberation and moderation in thought,\r\nword, and deed. It is a time for the submersion of all our\r\ndifferences, sympathies, and feelings in a unity of purpose and desire\r\nfor our country’s good.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, permit me to say that all of us who may trace our\r\nancestry across the sea no matter to what particular country, should\r\nbe the first to speak out loudly and clearly that our undivided\r\nloyalty and allegiance is with America, always, no matter what may be\r\nour tie.\r\n\r\n                             Yours very truly,\r\n                                          PAUL O. HUSTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Washington, D. C., Apr. 1, 1916.\r\n\r\n  Rev. ---- ----,\r\n  ----, Wis.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour letter of some time ago, expressing the disapproval of the\r\npastors of the Lutheran Conference of the Iowa Synod held in Beaver\r\nDam, in January, of my attitude on the embargo on munitions question\r\nwas duly received. The letter appeared in the Milwaukee papers on the\r\nSaturday before and therefore its contents were familiar to me before\r\nreceiving the same by mail. The reason that this letter was not\r\nanswered was because it seemed to me that it called for no reply but\r\nthat it was merely intended to give public expression to your\r\ndisapproval by your Conference of my attitude and vote on these\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nNow in reply to yours of the 20th inst. and also to that above\r\nreferred to let me first say that I regret very much that any act or\r\nattitude of mine as Senator from Wisconsin should meet with the\r\ndisapproval of any number of my fellow citizens. I am not insensible\r\nof the support that I received from many citizens of German extraction\r\nin the last campaign nor do I think that there is anybody representing\r\nthe state of Wisconsin who is more anxious to please and to retain the\r\nconfidence, respect, and good will of his fellow citizens of German\r\nextraction or ancestry, for that matter, than I am, provided that I\r\ncan do so without acting inconsistently with my oath of office or my\r\nsense of duty.\r\n\r\nIn justification of my attitude let me say then that my vote and my\r\nattitude on our foreign relations are the result of deep-seated\r\nconvictions based upon study and a great deal of thought upon this\r\nsubject and I am maintaining such attitude and convictions upon the\r\nsubject (notwithstanding that some of my fellow citizens disagree with\r\nme) because I am convinced that if I did otherwise I would be\r\ncommitting my country to a wrong and dangerous policy--a policy which\r\nnot only might, but which probably would, force us into war and this\r\nis a result which I understand neither you nor any other citizen\r\ndesires, if it can honorably be avoided. Holding such convictions (at\r\nleast honestly formed) I feel that would be violating my oath of\r\noffice and my duty as a Senator if I voted contrary to my convictions\r\nin order to please you or others. This I manifestly cannot and of\r\ncourse will not do. I consider it my first duty as a Senator and as a\r\ncitizen to support and sustain my government in a crisis like this.\r\n\r\nThe criticism expressed in your letter is confined to two matters\r\nonly, namely: First--My attitude on the embargo question. Second--My\r\nvote on the Gore Resolution. And you tell me that my attitude on the\r\none and my vote on the other is not in accordance with the wishes or\r\nsentiments of the people of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThe substance of your criticism is contained in the sentence which I\r\nquote from your letter: “We therefore have a perfect right to expect\r\nthat those men, whom we sent to represent _our_ interests, whom we\r\nsent to represent us before the President we have elected, should vote\r\nas we would vote, if we had an opportunity to cast our vote. We know\r\nfull well that you are not an instructed delegate, this being\r\nimpossible, and yet you ought to vote as you know that your\r\nconstituents _require_ you to vote.”\r\n\r\nNow let me ask you upon what you base your assertion that I am not\r\nvoting the way the majority of my constituents “require” me to vote?\r\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin have never yet recorded or had an\r\nopportunity to record their sentiment or opinions on these questions,\r\nand consequently I have no means at my command that will enable me to\r\ninform myself as to how my constituents would “require” me to vote. I\r\nbelieve that you will admit that you have no means of ascertaining or\r\nknowing how the people of Wisconsin would “require” me to vote and\r\nthat you are merely assuming that all the people of Wisconsin feel as\r\nyou and your associates do upon these matters. I believe furthermore\r\nthat you will admit that sympathizing with Germany as you do that you\r\nare not an impartial and unbiased judge of the facts involved in the\r\nissue. I am sure that there are thousands of others in this state who\r\nbelieve and claim that the people of Wisconsin are overwhelmingly\r\nsupporting President Wilson’s attitude on both of these questions. Of\r\ncourse these expressions of opinion come from many who also are not\r\nimpartial and unprejudiced or unbiased in the premises although I may\r\nadd that I have received scores and scores of letters from men of\r\nGerman ancestry who hold a like opinion to mine. With such conflicting\r\nopinions as is perfectly natural to be the case in a state of mixed\r\npopulation like Wisconsin even you must admit that the sentiment of\r\nthe people of our state is by no means unanimous on the subject\r\nmatter. At the beginning of and so long as our country was not in\r\ndanger of being drawn into this terrible war, I also indulged myself\r\nin sympathizing with a certain side in this world’s struggle. But for\r\nover a year this country has stood and now stands on the very verge of\r\na volcano and no one could, nor now can, know when we will be drawn\r\ninto its crater. Consequently, ever since this danger has arisen, I\r\nhave tried to dismiss from mind all interest in connection with the\r\nwar except in so far as it affects or might affect the interests or\r\nrights of our people and our country and I harbor no motive in my\r\nconsciousness in connection with my office other than to protect and\r\npromote our own country’s rights and interests. With such motive and\r\nsuch thought, I feel that I ought to be able to vote upon this\r\nEuropean situation fairly and impartially as between the belligerents.\r\nI am at least conscious of this: That whatever attitude I take and\r\nwhatever vote I cast is cast with reference solely to its effect on\r\nthis country and regardless of its effect upon the welfare of any\r\nother country in the world.\r\n\r\nNow under such circumstances do you think that I should allow your\r\nsympathies or the sympathies of your associates or my sympathies to\r\noutweigh and overcome my settled convictions, and that I should\r\nviolate my oath of office as United States Senator and act and vote in\r\ndirect contradiction to what I conceive to be my duty as a Senator and\r\nas a citizen of the United States? I cannot think that you would have\r\nme do so. I cannot in a letter repeat my reasons, which I have so\r\noften stated in public speeches and interviews, why I am opposed to\r\nour government placing an embargo on munitions of war and,\r\nconsequently, I must refer you to such speeches and interviews for\r\nsuch information. I can only state that such action on the part of our\r\ncountry would in my judgment be a gross breach of neutrality which not\r\nonly might, but probably would, involve us in a war with those foreign\r\ncountries adversely affected by such action on our part. I voted\r\nagainst the Gore Resolution because I am opposed, _by governmental\r\naction_, to curtailing or abandoning the rights of our citizens upon\r\nthe high seas or wherever they have a right to be, as an act unworthy\r\nof a great nation and of a great people, and, furthermore, because I\r\nam sure that with the passage of such a resolution our troubles in\r\nthat respect would not have been ended but would have only just begun.\r\nWith the abandonment of one right, we would soon have been called upon\r\nto abandon another and still another, and, having said “A,” we would\r\nnot only have had to say “B” but we would have had to continue clear\r\ndown the alphabet to “Z,” and we would finally find ourselves bereft\r\nof all rights cravenly and uselessly abandoned by us to wrong-doing\r\ncountries. Personally, I would not now travel on the high seas unless\r\nI was obliged thus to travel and I would not ask or in fact advise any\r\nfriend of mine to travel upon the high seas under present conditions,\r\nbut what I am opposed to is that our government by affirmative action\r\nshould warn our citizens not to travel upon the high seas and in\r\neffect then to license the world to kill and slaughter our citizens in\r\nthe act of exercising their God-given and lawful rights so to do. Such\r\nauthoritative action would be a puerile abandonment of the rights of\r\nour citizens and of our country and a cowardly withdrawal of the\r\nprotection which our flag owes to our people and would not only invite\r\nthe contempt and aggression of the belligerent nations but would bring\r\nus into contempt in the eyes of our own citizens themselves.\r\n\r\nNow, in the sentence quoted, you characterized me as one of those “* *\r\n* whom we sent to represent _our_ interests * * * .” Now let me ask\r\nyou whether you or your associates have any interest which I am\r\nrepresenting other or different in any degree from that of any other\r\ncitizen of Wisconsin? You surely can have no interest, which I\r\nrepresent, in the success of any foreign nation in this war. You may\r\nhave _wishes_ or _hopes_ in regard to the outcome of the war in Europe\r\nbut as an _American_ citizen you certainly have no _interest_ in the\r\nresult. The interests of our country, your interests, my interests,\r\nare identical and are limited to this: That we keep our hands off and\r\nlet the warring nations fight it out according to the rules of\r\ninternational law and, if we can, protect the lives of our people and\r\nmaintain their rights and the rights of our country and preserve our\r\nnational honor. While it is not my _duty_ to _represent_ your _wishes_\r\n(which may stand in direct contravention to the dictates of our own\r\nnational welfare), it is my duty to represent (and it is my conviction\r\nthat I am performing that duty and am properly representing) the\r\ninterests of the country, _your_ interests, _my_ interests, and the\r\ninterests of all the people of the United States, when I take the\r\nattitude I am taking and vote as I have voted.\r\n\r\nNow while I have grown up among people of German ancestry and have\r\ngrown to love and respect my German-American neighbors, among whom I\r\ncount you and many others of your cloth, I cannot and will not forget\r\nthat as Senator I represent all of the people of Wisconsin regardless\r\nof ancestry or accident of birth and as such Senator I represent not\r\nonly the people of Wisconsin but the people of the United States as a\r\nwhole, and I want to say further that as long as I remain in the\r\nSenate I shall count the interests of my country first, wholly without\r\nregard to its effect upon my political fortunes or upon the fortunes\r\nof any foreign country.\r\n\r\nWhile I have no authority to talk for anyone but myself, I believe\r\nthat President Wilson is actuated by the same motives as I am. Can any\r\nman doubt that the President of the United States is doing what he\r\ndoes and acting as he acts with any thought in his mind other than the\r\nwelfare of his country and of our people? Now you say in your letter,\r\n“I admit that we have not the insight into the inner affairs and for\r\nthat reason leave it to the discretion of our representatives to cast\r\ntheir vote to the best welfare of the State”; and further you say in\r\nsubstance that you have taken a vital interest in this matter and that\r\nthe consensus of opinion of your associates, the majority of whom are\r\nuniversity men, is that an embargo should be placed upon munitions of\r\nwar. Now you admit that your opinion is based upon imperfect,\r\nincomplete, unreliable, and (what at times must be) false information.\r\nYou also inferentially admit, as you must admit (indeed as everybody\r\nknows is the fact) that the President and his Cabinet are in\r\npossession of the most perfect, the most complete, most reliable and\r\nmost trustworthy information obtainable. Moreover, the President is\r\nalso a university man (if that has anything to do with it) and is he\r\nnot also a citizen of the United States who loves his country? Is he\r\nnot a man of intellect, of integrity, of patriotism, of ability, of\r\ncourage, a man possessing all those attributes that go to make up our\r\nidea of a good American citizen? As President, in the handling of\r\ndomestic affairs, has he not shown himself mindful of the welfare of\r\nthe masses of the people? In this world’s crisis has he not kept us\r\nout of war during the most trying times--under the gravest\r\ndifficulties--when there was not a Congress in session and when there\r\nwere no warning resolutions; when newspapers, politicians, partisans,\r\nand sympathizers were trying to provoke him into the most drastic\r\naction against one or the other side of this controversy? And this at\r\na time when scores of incidents have occurred, each one alone of\r\nsufficient importance to have provoked us into war against one side or\r\nthe other side of the belligerents, had the President been so minded.\r\nWhen you and I and all of us during the summer of 1915 were pursuing\r\nour peaceful occupations in Wisconsin, the President was left alone to\r\ncarry a load that would have staggered and borne down any ordinary\r\nman! During all this time, in waking or in sleeping, has he had\r\nanything in his mind but the peaceful solution of his monumental task\r\nwithout dishonor to our country?\r\n\r\nAnd now let me ask whether you ought not to admit that it is a little\r\npresumptuous on your part to think or claim that you are more\r\npatriotic, more desirous of doing, and better able to do justice\r\nbetween the belligerents of Europe--more desirous and better able to\r\nsafeguard and protect the national honor and the welfare and rights of\r\nour people than our president, Woodrow Wilson? In other words, are you\r\nnot willing to concede that, under all the facts and circumstances\r\nsurrounding this vital matter, Woodrow Wilson ought to be better\r\nqualified in all respects to properly pass upon these questions and to\r\nprotect our rights than anyone else who neither has the responsibility\r\nor the opportunity nor has devoted the thought and time to this\r\nmatter, that he has?\r\n\r\nNow would you and your associates, with all due respect to your\r\nlearning and information, which at best (as you admit is, and which\r\nnecessarily can be, based only on imperfect and uncertain premises)\r\nhave me accept your judgment in this matter in preference to that of\r\nthe President of the United States? Not only that, but would you have\r\nme under _such circumstances_ disregard the judgment of the President\r\nand his Cabinet who are lawfully invested with the authority and\r\nbusiness of determining these questions which as a matter of law is\r\nand as a matter of common sense ought to be final and binding upon the\r\npeople of the United States and with this also abandon my own judgment\r\nand accept yours in lieu thereof? If each citizen of the United States\r\nwould set _his_ judgment and opinion above that of the President of\r\nthe United States in our foreign affairs and refuse to abide by his\r\nconclusions in time of acute crises such as these, could anything but\r\nnational chaos be the result? In domestic affairs that do not concern\r\nthe life of the country we all have a right to insist upon our\r\nopinions and, even then, we must bow when overruled by the majority.\r\nThen how much more in foreign affairs must we lodge somewhere\r\nauthority for determining matters affecting our national life itself.\r\nAnd where else shall we lodge them than in the hands of our President\r\nand Secretary of State, at least until all diplomatic means shall have\r\nbeen exhausted? Now I do not say that citizens have no right to\r\nexpress their opinions even on foreign affairs; but what I do say is\r\nthat they ought not to so exercise that right and so conduct\r\nthemselves as to embarrass and hinder our government in its diplomatic\r\nnegotiations with foreign countries _at times like these_, and thus\r\nimperil, if not absolutely prevent, a peaceful solution of our\r\ndifficulties, great enough in themselves, but made still greater by\r\nthe utterances of some papers and persons which give color and basis\r\nfor the claim and impression abroad that we are a disunited and\r\ndemoralized people, a people who have lost their faith and confidence\r\nin their own government, and who will not give it their loyal and\r\nundivided support in all eventualities. We can maintain peace best by\r\npresenting a solid front to all nations to the end that they may know\r\nand understand that we are one and indivisible no matter what may\r\ncome!\r\n\r\nNow you further say: “As to the notion that under all circumstances\r\nthe opinions of the President must be upheld, in order to be loyal\r\nAmericans, that is pure and simple ‘rot.’” Let me say to you that\r\nsupporting the President under present circumstances is not “rot”\r\nunless loyalty to one’s country is also “rot”! Upholding the President\r\nunder present circumstances does not mean the upholding of an\r\nindividual in his opinion or judgment. For a Senator or a citizen of\r\nthe United States to back the President and to accept his conclusions\r\nbased upon known facts in foreign matters of gravest importance at a\r\ntime of the nation’s peril like this is not a servile following of an\r\nindividual and is not “rot.” On the contrary such backing and such\r\nacceptance is only supporting and maintaining one’s government. It is\r\nevidence of loyalty to one’s country. Such action and such acceptance\r\nis not merely supporting President Wilson as a man, it is supporting\r\nthe United States--our government--our country, which the President\r\nfor the time being represents and for which he is authorized to act\r\nand must act.\r\n\r\nI quote further from your letter: “Our slogan is ‘America first, last,\r\nand all the time, regardless of party lines, President, or\r\nrepresentatives.’” Our President for the time being within certain\r\nlimitations is America and he acts for America. And in my judgment it\r\nis the first duty not only of Senators but of citizens who are for\r\n_America_ first, last, and all the time, to be for our _government_\r\nfirst, last, and all the time that for the time being is our\r\ngovernment. _No citizen can be against_ our government and still at\r\nthe same time justly claim that he is _for America_. One cannot be for\r\nand against the same thing at the same time.\r\n\r\nNow there is another matter in relation to the Beaver Dam letter of\r\nJan. 27 which was a communication entitled from the “pastors of the\r\nGerman Lutheran Church in Conference at Beaver Dam, Wis., Assembled.”\r\nIt appears from this letter that you have assumed to put your church\r\non record as opposed to the foreign policy of this government at a\r\ntime when it was essential that the government should have the united\r\nsupport of its citizens and to make public your disapproval in your\r\npastoral capacity, evidently for the purpose of bringing the President\r\nand the representative of your state into political disfavor with your\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nNow what I have to say in this connection is said in all friendliness\r\nto the members of the Conference, many of whom I personally know and\r\nrespect. I acknowledge the right of any man, no matter what his\r\nprofession or calling may be, to speak his mind freely on political\r\nmatters and to vote as he pleases at elections and consequently every\r\npastor has a right to express his own personal opinions on any subject\r\nthat he may desire to speak upon and, furthermore, he has a right to\r\nexpress his own opinion without in any way injecting religion into\r\npolitics so long as he merely expresses his own personal opinion and\r\ndoes not attempt to talk for his church or for the purpose, as pastor,\r\nof influencing the people of his church. I wish, however, to express\r\nmy opinion that no matter what the merit or excellence of their\r\nmotives or principles that may underlie such organizations or their\r\nactions, it will be an unhappy and unfortunate thing for the country\r\nand for the church when churches will be used as political\r\norganizations or utilities and when its pastors will become the heads\r\nof such organizations.\r\n\r\nThis country is and has been the refuge and the shield of all men who\r\ndesire to worship God as they please. This is a country of freedom of\r\nreligion as well as freedom of thought. We have been endeavoring for\r\nmore than a century to keep our government and our politics divorced\r\nfrom religion. We have been endeavoring to permit these to run along\r\nparallel lines but at the same time to keep them separated and prevent\r\nthem from impinging one upon the other. The separation of Church and\r\nState has been one of the keynotes in our arch and has thus far done\r\nmuch to strengthen and sustain our national structure. But in the last\r\nfew years there has been a growing tendency to inject religion into\r\npolitics. I have always steadfastly and consistently discouraged and\r\ncriticized such tendency wherever I could. I consider it a most\r\ndangerous tendency--a tendency which bodes no good either to the\r\nnation or to the church. It is bad indeed to inject the _Church into\r\nPolitics_. It is as bad or worse to inject _Politics into the Church_.\r\nIf you inject the _Church into Politics_ you will brush aside the\r\ntraditions of our country since its existence and you will be laying\r\nthe axe to the very roots of our government. And if you inject\r\n_Politics into the Church_ you will also be laying the axe to the very\r\nroots of your religion. You cannot have politics in your church\r\nwithout having _factions_ in your _church_ and when you have\r\n_factions_ in your _church_ you will _divide_ your _church_, which\r\nhistory shows has ever been the case when governments and churches\r\nmixed. Our Revolutionary fathers wisely profited by the experience of\r\nother nations and by the teachings of history when they provided that\r\nthe State and Church should be forever kept separate. All good\r\ncitizens will deplore anything that endangers our country; and all\r\ngood people, regardless of religion, will deplore anything that will\r\ninjure the Church--an institution [which] when properly separated from\r\nthe government exercises an infinite influence for good in this\r\ncountry. For these reasons I hereby respectfully record my deep regret\r\nat the action of the Beaver Dam Conference because I fear that you may\r\nbe setting an unwise precedent fraught with consequences of a\r\ndangerous character both to the Church and to the State in thus, as\r\npastors, using the influence of your church in the manner attempted.\r\n\r\nOne thing to me seems certain; if we desire to continue the freedom of\r\nreligion in our country, it can only be done by keeping it free from\r\npolitics and if we are going to have freedom of politics it can only\r\nbe done by keeping it free from religious interference. The one\r\nproposition is interdependent upon the other and the rule cannot be\r\nviolated without lasting injury and damage to both Church and State. I\r\ntrust that the great Lutheran Church and all of the other great\r\nchurches of the country will never put themselves into the attitude of\r\nattempting to control the politics of the country. I most fervently\r\nhope that religious and racial influence and prejudices may never be\r\npermitted by any church or body of men to promote or prevent the\r\nelection of any man to public office or to dictate to or to influence\r\nour government in its relations or negotiations with foreign nations.\r\n\r\nLet me conclude by saying that in all of these troublous times we\r\nshould remember that we are at peace--that we have been kept out of\r\nthis war thus far by a president and an administration which have\r\ndedicated their efforts to promote the public welfare--that they are\r\ndoing the very best they can to continue to keep us out of war if this\r\ncan be done without loss of national honor or without surrendering or\r\nabandoning our national rights or the rights of our citizens. In this\r\neffort, the government should be sustained by all good citizens,\r\nregardless of race or religion. It is the duty of every citizen to\r\nsustain it! This is _the_ country in which all our interests are\r\ncentered--the only country to which we owe any loyalty or\r\nallegiance--the country which safeguards and protects us--the country\r\nwhich we in return are bound to protect and defend always. It is easy,\r\nof course, to be a good citizen in fair weather but it is in foul\r\nweather that the best citizenship is needed. It is in the storm and\r\nstress of national peril that loyalty and devotion to the public\r\nwelfare is put to the acid test. Let us lay aside all of our\r\ndifferences, all of our sympathies, all of our prejudices, so far as\r\nthey relate to other countries, and let us think and speak and act\r\nsolely with regard to the good of our own country.\r\n\r\n                             Very respectfully,\r\n                                           PAUL O. HUSTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   May 19, 1917.\r\n\r\n  Mr. ---- ----,\r\n  ----, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir:\r\n\r\nYours of May 16th was duly received and contents noted. In reply I\r\nwant to say that your letter bears evidence of conscientious thought\r\nand your conclusions are, no doubt, honest. I assume you have written\r\nme not only for the purpose of giving your own views but also are\r\ninviting mine in return. And inasmuch as you have volunteered a doubt\r\nas to whether or not your German ancestry has colored or biased your\r\njudgment in the premises, I take the liberty of giving you my judgment\r\non that point as I gather it from the context of this and your\r\nprevious letter.\r\n\r\nI believe your reasonings and your conclusions are from the German,\r\nnot the American, standpoint. In other words, you are holding a brief\r\nfor Germany and not for the United States. “How important a part” your\r\n“German ancestry plays” in this, it may be difficult for you to\r\napprehend but your bias will readily be apparent to anyone who reads\r\nyour letter. Now, you are an American-born citizen, I take it. You are\r\nan attorney-at-law and a member of the bar of Wisconsin. You owe a\r\nduty to your country which sympathy for Germany, no matter how genuine\r\nit may be, cannot diminish, much less nullify. Now the premises from\r\nwhich you as an American must reason are these: This country is at war\r\nwith Germany. Your President, my President, our President, backed by a\r\ndeclaration of your Congress, my Congress, our Congress, has\r\nproclaimed that war exists. This was done for reasons which appeared\r\nsufficient to the President and the Congress to make this declaration\r\nimperative. The loyalty and the fidelity of the President and of\r\nCongress to the people of the nation has never been questioned or\r\nchallenged and I do not understand you to challenge or question them\r\nnow. You are merely attempting in your letter to set your judgment\r\nagainst theirs. Germany is now an enemy of the United States which\r\nmeans that she is your enemy, my enemy, our enemy. Now, it is plain,\r\nas the Vice President remarked in a speech some time ago, that we\r\ncannot have a hundred million presidents or secretaries of state,\r\nmeaning, of course, that we can only have one of each at a time and\r\nthat when these officers, to whom this power has been delegated, have,\r\nwith the aid of Congress, committed this government to a war, that\r\nquestion to all intents and purposes of the war is settled for all men\r\nwho are citizens of the United States. And when the status of our\r\nrelations with a foreign country is once fixed as that of war, then\r\nthe time for argument has ceased and there is no longer any room for\r\ncontroversy between citizens upon that question. The question then,\r\nfor the time being, that is to say, during the pendency of the war, is\r\na closed and not an open one. And for the sake of your peace of mind\r\nas well as in justice to yourself as an American citizen who does not\r\ndesire his loyalty questioned or to have his honorable reputation\r\npermanently impaired, you should respect, obey, and support the\r\nmandate of your country in the spirit of true and devoted American\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nNow, I assume you love this country and that you love it because it is\r\na free country and that you are here practicing your profession\r\nbecause of your desire to live in and to practice law in a country\r\nwhere fullest and freest opportunity is afforded you to work out your\r\nown destiny in your own way. In short, I assume that you favor a\r\nrepublican form of government and that you are devoted to America and\r\nits free institutions. I am sure that you would not have anyone\r\nbelieve otherwise of you because that would impute to you disloyalty\r\nand moreover it would impute to you a lack of intelligent enterprise\r\nby your remaining in a country that according to your ideas is\r\nimproperly governed instead of removing yourself to the jurisdiction\r\nof another country which more nearly squares with your ideas of good\r\ngovernment. So, I repeat that I assume that you are here because you\r\nlike to be here under a government that suits you and which you love\r\nbetter than any other government on earth. Now, it is evident in your\r\nletter that you love and sympathize with Germany but the question\r\narises in my mind whether your love is for the German people or for\r\nthe German government. You can easily put yourself to the test. If you\r\nlove the German people then you must desire them to have as good a\r\ngovernment as you enjoy here and it ought to make you happy that your\r\ncountry, if it prevails in this war, will make the German people as\r\nfree and as happy as you are. If, on the other hand, you are mostly\r\nconcerned in the success of the German government, that is to say, if\r\nyou are mostly concerned in having the present Hohenzollern dynasty\r\nremain in power, then it would seem to be quite clear that your love\r\nis not for the German people but for the Hohenzollern dynasty and the\r\nGerman autocracy. In other words, your love would then be of the form\r\nand not of the substance. You cannot love this country and its\r\ninstitutions and at the same time love the German autocracy. These are\r\nincompatible and repugnant one to the other. They cannot both exist in\r\nthe same heart at the same time. Your love for the German people, as\r\nis your love of mankind generally, is entirely compatible with your\r\nlove of this country but it must be clear to you, as it must be\r\nperfectly clear to every American, that you cannot love your country\r\nand the German people and mankind generally and at the same time love\r\nthe fearful German autocracy which is trying to impose or impress its\r\nsystem, its frightfulness, and its wish and will upon the world and\r\nwhich in its mad lust for power silences the promptings of conscience,\r\nscoffs at the weakness of love for human-kind, deafens its ears to the\r\ndictates of humanity, and which in pursuit of its fell purpose sets at\r\nnaught all law human and divine. Now let me ask you to search your\r\nheart and see whether your love for the German fatherland is a love\r\ncompatible with your duties as an American citizen--whether it is\r\ncompatible with your love of liberty and humanity--whether it is\r\ncompatible with the principles enunciated in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence that all men are entitled to the right of “life, liberty\r\nand the pursuit of happiness”! If such love is compatible with all\r\nthese then your love for the German fatherland is a virtue and not a\r\nvice. But, if searching deeply into your heart you find that your love\r\nof the fatherland means that you love the relentless, ruthless, and\r\ndespotic Hohenzollern dynasty and its system, pluck it out as you\r\nwould a cancer, for it is a thing of evil and you cannot love it and\r\nbe a good and true American.\r\n\r\nYou write “The President’s statement to the effect that the War is not\r\ndirected against the German people never appealed to me.” For the\r\nreasons I have just given it should appeal to you as an American and\r\nas a lover of liberty and it should appeal to the German people\r\nthemselves and their sympathizers in this country. It should appeal to\r\nlovers of liberty the world over--this statement that we are warring\r\non a Power and not a People. We are warring on the Power because it\r\nhas set its hand and might against the world and setting aside all\r\nlaws of God and man it has outlawed itself and has no right to live.\r\nBut in destroying this Power there is no intent, or disposition, or\r\nwish to destroy the People. The President’s statement means, as I\r\ninterpret it, that the one thing that stands between peace and war\r\nwith Germany is the Hohenzollern dynasty. Once let that obstacle be\r\nremoved either by the German people themselves or by the arbitrament\r\nof arms and our troubles and differences with Germany are over. Now\r\ncan an American citizen of German extraction who puts the welfare and\r\nhappiness of the people of Germany ahead of that of the Kaiser or, in\r\nother words, ahead of the Hohenzollern dynasty and the autocratic\r\nsystem which that dynasty embodies and typifies, enlist himself, his\r\nsympathies, his resources, his life, in a higher and holier cause than\r\nto join in emancipating the German people from the thrall of the\r\nHohenzollern dynasty and to save the German people whom he professes\r\nto love from a doom which an outraged world has pronounced and sealed\r\nagainst the ruthless and frightful Hohenzollern system? Now and here\r\nis the opportunity for all who love the German people to give proof of\r\nit. Let them all get back of the President and of their government and\r\nto the extent of their influence, ability, might, and power help to\r\nbring to their brothers in blood across the sea that priceless boon of\r\nliberty and independence which they or their ancestors sailed the\r\nperilous seas to find here in America. Let them make sacrifice and\r\nhelp and fight to give to their friends and kinsmen across the ocean\r\nthat which was given to most of them here without cost or sacrifice on\r\ntheir part.\r\n\r\nIt is quite apparent to almost everyone that there can be no peace--no\r\npermanent peace--in the world so long as one power seeks to impose its\r\nautocratic straight jacket upon the world. Since the birth of the\r\nAmerican Republic, the world has been marching away from autocracy and\r\ntoward universal democracy, gathering irresistible momentum with the\r\nadvance of time. All rulers, all statesmen, all men recognize this\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nEven in countries autocratically ruled greater liberties and rights\r\nhave been accorded the common people and it is only a question of time\r\nwhen the doctrine of the divinity of kings will become a tradition and\r\nthe world will become one vast democracy. I repeat that the world is\r\nturning with irresistible momentum to a world democracy and the rulers\r\nof the world recognize that the logic of events is bound to substitute\r\ngovernments “of, by and for the people” in place of “of, by and for”\r\nkaisers, czars, and kings. There is practically one autocracy in the\r\nworld which still has the power and efficiency to make that power felt\r\nin its attempt, its will and purpose upon the world; but one power on\r\nearth that today constitutes a menace and obstruction to the onward\r\ntread of democracy and that power is Germany! It is the Hohenzollern\r\ndynasty which is illogically, in indifference and contempt of the\r\nworld’s sentiment, ignoring the teachings of history, unheeding the\r\nwarnings of history with that fatuousness which always blinds the eyes\r\nof those who look only for their self-aggrandizement, that is trying\r\nto turn the world backward. It is the Hohenzollern dynasty that has\r\nthrown itself in the path of the onward march of liberty and progress,\r\ntrying not only to stem the irresistible physical and spiritual forces\r\nof the world but actually trying to rout and drive them back into the\r\ndark ages of despotism. It must be obvious to every thinking man that\r\nthis attempt will fail. No man or set of men in this day or age will\r\nbe permitted to rule the world. Every ruler, every dynasty which\r\nunyieldingly places itself in the pathway of liberty and progress will\r\nbe overthrown; every people, no matter how powerful or great, which\r\nblindly and absolutely places itself behind, follows, and clings to\r\nsuch ruler and dynasty, will inevitably sooner or later be crushed and\r\nutterly destroyed with it. And so the German autocracy which today\r\nmenaces the world and obstructs its progress will be overthrown and\r\nthe German people if they continue blindly and absolutely to cling to\r\ntheir dynasty will inevitably share the same fate. Whether Germany\r\nprevails in this war or not, there will be and can be no lasting peace\r\nuntil the inevitable end is reached. So that in the end, be it sooner\r\nor later, democracy will be established and autocracy will perish. The\r\ndestruction of the autocratic Hohenzollern dynasty would be a blessing\r\nto the world. The destruction of the German people would be a calamity\r\nto the world. I do not believe that the German people are going to\r\ncommit national suicide. I do not believe that they are long going to\r\ncontinue to sacrifice the substance for the form. I do not believe\r\nthat they will deem it wise to suffer a national death in order to\r\nuphold the life of a government that is based on error, not on truth,\r\nwhich the world tried and found wanting, and which is responsible for\r\nthe catastrophe which has befallen themselves and the world at large.\r\nIt is unthinkable--it is unbelievable--that the German people are\r\nunaffected by the onward movement of democracy and that they alone\r\nwill continue to hug the despotism and the system that is unsuited to\r\nthe requirements and unworthy of a modern civilization. Wherefore, it\r\nwould seem clear to me that all citizens of German extraction would be\r\nquick to realize and appreciate the force of the President’s\r\ndeclaration that we are not warring against the German people but\r\nagainst the German autocracy and would enthusiastically support their\r\nown government in a purpose which means freedom to the German people,\r\nand in thus giving their whole hearted support to their own government\r\nthey would be discharging their duty, they would be true to their\r\nallegiance as American citizens, and at the same time they would be\r\nfurthering the best interests of the German people and aiding them in\r\nthe only way in which they properly can.\r\n\r\nI have received a number of letters of the same purport as yours and I\r\nam going to publish my letter to you so that it may serve as an answer\r\nlikewise to others who are minded as you are. I know that there are in\r\nour midst a number of serious, well-meaning men who hold the ideas and\r\nsentiments which you have expressed--sentiments which, it is perfectly\r\nclear, are incompatible with the duties and responsibilities of\r\nAmerican citizenship in a crisis like this as well as incompatible\r\nwith the intelligence and the character of the men entertaining them.\r\nIn the various public speeches I have made and communications I have\r\npublished during this crisis, I have sought to speak only in the\r\nfurtherance of what I understand and conceive to be the truth of the\r\nmatter and the welfare of our country. I have been animated solely by\r\na purpose to dispel error and to promote the interests of our country\r\nand not by the slightest ill-feeling or malice toward any man. I have\r\nsought to express myself frankly and without reserve but, at the same\r\ntime, I hope fairly, courteously, and without malice or feeling.\r\nHaving lived amongst Americans of German extraction all my life and\r\ncounting amongst them many of my best and dearest friends, I believe\r\nthat I know their processes of thought, their sentiments, their\r\nprejudices, and their intelligence. I know that they would not prefer\r\nto remain in error if once convinced that they are in error. They do\r\nnot want to be deceived. They do not want to be flattered into silence\r\nor apparent conviction. They like to hear straight, plain, blunt talk.\r\nLoving law and order and respecting authority, as I know they do, I\r\nhave always believed that the great mass of our citizens of German\r\nextraction would never permit themselves to be placed in an attitude\r\nof hostility to the orderly and just administration of the law or\r\npermit their loyalty or fidelity to be suspected or challenged. I know\r\nthat when once convinced they are quick to abandon a position once\r\nthey see that it is untenable.\r\n\r\nAnd so I have written this letter in the hope that I might be\r\ninstrumental in showing you that your position is untenable and in the\r\nhope that you will abandon it for one which will reflect credit on\r\nyour patriotism, your judgment, and your citizenship and which at the\r\nsame time will afford you the best opportunity for advancing the\r\ninterests and welfare of your kinsmen across the sea.\r\n\r\n                             Very truly yours,\r\n                                           PAUL O. HUSTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL FRAGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNINGS OF MILWAUKEE\r\n\r\nMr. B. F. Williams, of the firm of Williams and Stern, lawyers, of\r\nMilwaukee, visited the Historical Library in January in search of\r\nmaterial concerning the building of the first courthouse in Milwaukee,\r\nto be used in an injunction suit to prevent the removal of the\r\nMilwaukee County Courthouse from its present site. A member of the\r\nLibrary staff assisted him in his work, and found among the Society’s\r\nmanuscripts and pamphlets much material concerning the first days of\r\nAmerican occupation in Milwaukee. The village of Milwaukee (east side)\r\nwas organized in September, 1835, with Solomon Juneau as president;\r\nthe village of Kilbourntown (Milwaukee west side) was organized about\r\nthe same time with Byron Kilbourn as president. In January, 1838, the\r\ntwo villages were united by an act of the Wisconsin territorial\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nMorgan L. Martin, of Green Bay, was the real founder of Milwaukee. In\r\n1833 he noted the advantages of the site for a harbor, and secured\r\nfrom Lewis Cass, secretary of war, an order for its survey. Meantime\r\nMartin made a proposition to Juneau, the only settler on the site, to\r\ntake an undivided half of his claim, Juneau promising not to sell any\r\nof his share without Martin’s consent. Martin in this transaction\r\nevinced both wisdom and generosity--generosity in giving Juneau a\r\nchance to share the profits of the enterprise (for many men would have\r\nbought his claim outright for a small sum); wisdom in binding Juneau\r\nnot to dispose of his share without advice. The result proved the\r\nvalue of Martin’s foresight. In 1834 the preëmption act made Juneau’s\r\nclaim substantial. About this time Martin bought the preëmption right\r\nof Peter Juneau, which lay south of Solomon’s claim. The Michigan\r\nlegislature, of which Martin was a member, erected Milwaukee County in\r\n1834, and in 1835 organized the same, with the county seat at the\r\nvillage of Milwaukee.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile during 1834 many Americans visited the site of the\r\nfuture city and saw its possibilities for growth. Among these was\r\nByron Kilbourn who secured a claim to the west side of Milwaukee\r\nRiver. Martin and Juneau, early in 1835, proposed to Kilbourn to unite\r\ntheir interests. Kilbourn ignored this offer, and proceeded to develop\r\nhis town alone. Meanwhile both town sites were surveyed and their\r\nplats put on record. Martin and Juneau began to develop their\r\nproperty, by opening and grading streets. One block in the heart of\r\nthe town was set aside for the courthouse, and nearly $12,000 (a large\r\nsum for that time) was spent in erecting a suitable building. The\r\nground around the new public building was given to the village in\r\nperpetuity, for the use of the county courts.\r\n\r\nA large number of letters from Juneau to Martin are in the possession\r\nof the State Historical Society, and are interesting as revealing the\r\ngrowth of the village, and the personality of its proprietors.\r\nAlthough Martin and Juneau had transactions involving many thousands\r\nof dollars, there never was any disagreement between them. Neither did\r\nthey have a written contract, each one relying upon the honor of the\r\nother. And when hard times fell upon the little settlement in 1837 and\r\nlater, each partner bore his share of misfortune cheerfully and\r\nwithout a word of accusation or disagreement. Even after the union of\r\nMilwaukee village and Kilbourntown in 1838, a considerable rivalry was\r\nmaintained between the two parts of the town, which in some measure\r\nhas persisted to the present day.\r\n\r\n                                         LOUISE P. KELLOGG.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SENATORIAL ELECTION OF 1869\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Wisconsin elected a new senator to represent her in\r\nCongress. It was conceded on every hand that James R. Doolittle, whose\r\nterm expired March 4, 1869, had misrepresented the state’s sentiment\r\nin his support of President Johnson during the impeachment trial, and\r\nthat he had no chance of reëlection. This situation brought out a\r\nnumber of candidates, most of whom were “new” men. Among the tried and\r\ntrue candidates the most prominent were Cadwallader C. Washburn, then\r\ncongressman for the southwestern section of the state, and Horace\r\nRublee, vigorous editor of the chief Republican newspaper at Madison.\r\nEx-Governor Salomon was also in the field, but his candidacy was not\r\ntaken very seriously. The new men who were most prominently talked of\r\nwere Otis H. Waldo and Matt H. Carpenter, both of them Milwaukee\r\nlawyers. Waldo was the elder of the two, a man of ability and power,\r\nand a Republican from the foundation of the party. Carpenter was of\r\nDemocratic antecedents, a recent adherent of the reigning party. His\r\nstrength lay in his brilliant oratory, keen wit, and deep knowledge of\r\nmen. Erratic in his methods, but meteoric in his cleverness, he\r\npersuaded and enthralled his hearers when opportunity was afforded him\r\nfor speech. Carpenter had made a national reputation by his arguments\r\nin the Supreme Court on the Reconstruction issue. The president-elect,\r\nGeneral Grant, and his advisers were favorable to Carpenter’s\r\ncandidacy, which gave the Milwaukee lawyer a strong endorsement with\r\nWisconsin Republicans.\r\n\r\nThe senatorial campaign opened in June, and largely governed the\r\nelections for the ensuing Wisconsin legislature. By December the\r\nsituation had become acute, and all parties were lined up for the\r\ncontest. The preferences of every legislator-elect were canvassed and\r\nrecanvassed; and each candidate presented his claims and\r\nqualifications to the prominent members of the coming legislature in\r\npersonal letters. The State Historical Society has recently received a\r\ngift of a few letters relating to this campaign addressed to the\r\nHonorable Andrew Jackson Turner, of Portage, then an influential\r\nfigure in Wisconsin politics. Three of these letters, written in the\r\nearly winter of 1868-69, are from Carpenter, who bespeaks Turner’s\r\nsupport at the coming legislative session. Turner, however, had given\r\nhis pledge to Horace Rublee, and had been by him chosen manager of his\r\ncampaign. December 9, 1868, Carpenter wrote to Turner from Washington:\r\n“I recd your favor just as I was leaving home, postponing me in your\r\naffections to Mr. Rublee. But I think this will make no difference. I\r\nam sure the conflict will be between Mr. Washburn and myself & that he\r\nwill be elected, if I am not. You say that you shall support me next\r\nto Rublee, and I desire to thank you for this.”\r\n\r\nThe most interesting letter of the lot is that of Rublee himself,\r\nwritten November 23, 1868. In it he canvasses the entire legislative\r\npersonnel, telling of the predilections of each member and concluding:\r\n“In my judgement Carpenter cannot be elected, & I certainly think he\r\nought not to be elected.”\r\n\r\nAs all the world knows, Rublee was wrong. During the legislative\r\nsession, Carpenter’s manager arranged a public meeting in which all\r\nthe candidates were to set forth their views on the questions of the\r\nday. This meeting was contemptuously dubbed by Rublee “A\r\nSpelling-down”; none the less, neither he nor any other of the\r\ncandidates dared refuse the invitation to speak. Carpenter’s great\r\npowers as an orator stood him in good stead, and at the Republican\r\ncaucus held soon after the speech-making contest, he was triumphantly\r\nnominated, and elected, in due course, by the Republican majority in\r\nthe state legislature.\r\n\r\nThe intimate picture these old letters afford of the log-rolling days\r\nbefore the direct election of the senators by the people, gives them\r\nhistorical value for students of political methods, and lays bare the\r\nreasons that induced the modern revolt against “machine-made”\r\nrepresentatives in the upper house of Congress.\r\n\r\n                                         LOUISE P. KELLOGG.\r\n\r\n\r\n“KOSHKONONG” AND “MAN EATER”\r\n\r\nLake Koshkonong is one of the most beautiful sheets of water in\r\nWisconsin. In primitive times the region adjacent to it must have\r\nconstituted a perfect paradise for the red man. Even yet,\r\nnotwithstanding its settlement by whites for nearly three generations,\r\nthis is one of the favorite resorts of Wisconsin sportsmen. The Indian\r\nname “Koshkonong” has usually been explained as meaning “the lake we\r\nlive on.”[132] The letter which follows, recently presented to the\r\nState Historical Society by H. L. Skavlem, of Janesville, offers both\r\na new rendering of the Indian name and a new interpretation of it. No\r\nless interesting to those who care for Wisconsin’s primitive history\r\nis the new rendition offered of the name of Man Eater, the Rock River\r\nchief who dwelt on the shore of Lake Koshkonong a century ago. Mrs.\r\nKinzie, the author of _Wau Bun_, saw Man Eater or “Mee-chee-tai” on at\r\nleast two occasions. Over against the sad picture which Peter Vieau\r\npaints should be set her description of him as “a most noble Indian in\r\nappearance and character.”\r\n\r\n                                         Portage, Sept. 2, 1900.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Buckley, Attorney,\r\n  Beloit, Wis.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nHaving forgotten your initials I am compelled to address you as above.\r\n\r\nSome months ago you wrote me concerning “Man Eater’s” village and why\r\nhe was called “Man Eater.” I had no knowledge of the origin of his\r\nname, but the location of his village was easily ascertainable. Your\r\ninquiry aroused a desire to know more of the famous old Indian and I\r\nhave made many inquiries myself, but without results, until the\r\nthought occurred to me to address a note to the venerable Peter J.\r\nVieau, of Muskego, which I did through Mr. D. M. Fowler, of Milwaukee.\r\nI copy from Mr. V.’s reply, through an amanuensis:\r\n\r\n     “I never knew a lake of that name ‘Kosh-ko-nong’ but I know\r\n     ‘Kosh-kau-no-nong,’ meaning termination of a lake or river,\r\n     a dam or any obstruction making an ending, a stop, an\r\n     absolute end.\r\n\r\n     “Well, then, I never knew a chief of that _name_, but I knew\r\n     one of the name of ‘Mee-chee-tai.’ He was not a full-blooded\r\n     chief, but was considered as one among the Indian tribe. He\r\n     was half Winnebago and Pottowatomie. He was a powerful man\r\n     and a terror among the tribe. He was looked upon as a\r\n     sorcerer, and lived at that time as I recollect in the\r\n     neighborhood of Kosh-kau-no-nong. He used to do his trading\r\n     with Jacques Vieau, my father, when my father opened his\r\n     trading post in Milwaukee as early as 1795. It must be the\r\n     same man Mr. Turner refers to ‘Mee-chee-tai’; it means\r\n     ‘Heart-Eater.’ Now then the above statement can be\r\n     substantiated by my sister, Mrs. May Vieau Lavigne, visiting\r\n     with me at present. She knew him well, too.\r\n\r\n     “‘Mee-chee-tai’ was killed by his son in a drunken frolic\r\n     about the time of the speculation in Milwaukee in ’35 or\r\n     ’36. He killed his wife and his son ‘Shaw-gun-osh’ tried to\r\n     save his mother, and killed the old man his father, and that\r\n     ended his fearful career. He was considered a good Indian\r\n     when sober. Father used to think much of him. He was honest\r\n     in his dealings. He was a great juggler, performed great\r\n     tricks, &c.\r\n                                                 Yours P. J. V.”\r\n\r\nDid you ever see any reference to this Indian in any place other than\r\n“Wau-Bun”?\r\n\r\n                             Very respectfully,\r\n                                                   A. J. TURNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALIEN SUFFRAGE PROVISION IN THE CONSTITUTION OF WISCONSIN[133]\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the organic law of Wisconsin Territory, enacted by\r\nCongress in erecting the territory in 1836, only citizens of the\r\nUnited States were eligible to the franchise (section V, proviso).\r\nAbout the year 1840, immigrants from Germany, the British Isles, and\r\nNorway became an appreciable factor in the population of the\r\nterritory; but the naturalization law requiring a five years’\r\nresidence disfranchised this large group of settlers. The situation\r\ngrew tense by 1843, especially since the question of statehood was\r\nbeing discussed, and seemed likely to come to a head in 1844.\r\nMoreover, the matter was complicated by the Native-American agitation\r\nthroughout the country. Many openly advocated a twenty-one year\r\nprovision for naturalization, and Wisconsin’s foreigners grew restive\r\nunder this possibility.\r\n\r\nIt seemed quite certain that the Wisconsin legislature of 1844 would\r\npass a law providing for a referendum on the subject of statehood. In\r\nDecember, 1843, a large public meeting of German citizens was called\r\nat Milwaukee who drew up a petition for the right to participate in\r\nthis referendum. This was signed by 1,200 persons, and was probably\r\nthe largest petition ever presented to the territorial legislature. It\r\nbecame impossible to ignore the demand of the foreign settlers. The\r\nWhig and Democratic parties were struggling for the control of the\r\nterritorial offices. Wisconsin was normally Democratic by an\r\noverwhelming majority, but the Tyler administration had appointed a\r\nWhig governor, and patronage went with the administration. The Whigs\r\nwere accused of alliance with nativism; it therefore became them to\r\nprove the falsity of the charge. The Democrats felt certain of the\r\nforeign vote. The legislature, therefore, on January 22, 1844, passed\r\n“An Act in relation to the qualification of voters for state\r\ngovernment and for the election of delegates to form a state\r\nconstitution,” which provided that “all free white male inhabitants\r\nabove the age of 21 years, who have resided in said territory three\r\nmonths shall be deemed qualified, and shall be permitted to vote on\r\nsaid question” and for delegates to a convention to frame a\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nThe referendum vote which was taken in September, 1844, proved adverse\r\nto the question of a state government. There is no means of\r\nascertaining how many foreigners voted upon the question, but the\r\nentire vote was very light, and the alien voters seem not to have\r\ninfluenced the decision, which was anticipated by all parties in the\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the territorial legislature passed the act above\r\nreferred to, General Henry Dodge, Wisconsin’s territorial delegate in\r\nCongress, presented to that body a petition signed by 300 citizens in\r\nthe western part of the territory praying for a repeal of the proviso\r\nin the fifth section of the organic law of Wisconsin, and for the\r\npassage of a law granting suffrage to every free white male inhabitant\r\nof the age of twenty-one years within the territory, foreigners\r\nincluded. This is the petition referred to by G. F. Franklin in his\r\n_Legislative History of Naturalization_. The names of the signers of\r\nthe petition are not available. We conjecture that they were those of\r\nthe Cornish miners of that region, rather than of the American\r\nsettlers, because in after debates, the southwest section of the state\r\nopposed the law allowing aliens to vote.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1844 was at once attacked, and was made the basis of an\r\nattempt to defeat several prominent members of the legislature who had\r\nvoted for it. This was especially true in the northeast section where\r\nthe reëlection of Dr. Mason C. Darling, a prominent Democrat, was\r\nopposed because of his advocacy of the alien voting law. It was\r\nclaimed that the law was unconstitutional, violating both the\r\nConstitution of the United States and the organic law of the\r\nterritory. Dr. Darling came out with several long addresses on the\r\nsubject, basing the right of aliens to vote on the twelfth article of\r\nthe Ordinance of 1787, and on the inherent right of a sovereign state\r\nto form its constitution as it thought best.\r\n\r\nDr. Darling was reëlected, but the legislature of 1845 had hardly\r\nbegun its session when a determined effort was made to repeal the law\r\nof the previous session. In the course of the debates Dr. Darling\r\noffered a clause on the declaration of intention as an amendment, and\r\nanother member amended the three months to six months. Both of these\r\nchanges were accepted by the friends of the bill as compromise\r\nmeasures to mitigate the opposition. Dr. Darling said in his argument\r\nthat he considered the intention declaration as of no consequence,\r\nexcept as an evidence of actual settlement. This compromise saved the\r\nbill, and the amended act, approved February 8, 1845, reads: “No\r\nperson shall hereafter vote upon the subject of state government, or\r\nfor delegates to form a state constitution, who shall not have resided\r\nsix months within the Territory, and as an additional qualification\r\nshall be a citizen of the United States, or shall have declared his\r\nintention to become such; as the law requires.”\r\n\r\nThus the matter rested until the legislature of 1846 arranged again to\r\nsubmit the question of a state government to the people. An attempt\r\nwas made by the Whig party to amend the law of 1845 and allow only\r\ncitizens to vote. The suffrage provision was complicated by\r\ndifferences concerning negro, half-breed, and Indian suffrage. On the\r\ntest vote the law of 1845 was maintained by the strong majority of 19\r\nto 7, nearly all the Democrats voting in its favor.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional convention met in October, 1846, and the question\r\nof alien suffrage was much debated. Upon the ground that the acts of\r\n1844 and 1845 were both unconstitutional, petitions poured in,\r\nespecially from the Southwest, to limit the franchise to citizens of\r\nthe United States. The foreigners also availed themselves of the right\r\nof petition, and the able German delegates in the convention created a\r\nfavorable impression for alien suffrage. As finally adopted, the\r\narticle granted suffrage to one-year residents, and “all white persons\r\nnot citizens of the United States, who shall have declared their\r\nintention to become such, in conformity with the laws of Congress for\r\nthe naturalization of aliens, and shall have taken before any officer\r\nof this state * * * an oath to support the constitution of the United\r\nStates and of this state.”\r\n\r\nThe constitution of 1846 was rejected by the people. In the\r\ndiscussion, then, of the provision for alien voters it played but a\r\nsmall part. The friends of the constitution set forth its liberality\r\nto foreigners and the fact that it acknowledged the equal rights\r\nnature bestowed upon foreign and native-born citizens alike. Opponents\r\nof the constitution set forth on the one hand the over-liberality to\r\nthe alien element, and on the other hand the requirement of an\r\nadditional oath as an illiberal burden to foreign residents.\r\n\r\nIn the constitutional convention of 1847-48 the subject of the foreign\r\nfranchise occupied a large share of the time of the delegates. The\r\ndelegates from the western counties came with a deliberate\r\ndetermination to limit the franchise to citizens of the United States.\r\nThe admission of foreigners to suffrage placed the West in a permanent\r\nminority, as the lake-board and middle sections of the territory had\r\nthe bulk of the immigrant population.\r\n\r\nThe original proposition as brought in by the committee restored the\r\nresidence requirement to six months, retained the intention of\r\ncitizenship clause, and omitted the special oath. The examples of New\r\nYork, Ohio, and Illinois were cited. One member urged that the\r\none-year requirement was necessary in New York to ascertain the\r\npermanent character of the residence, while all who came to Wisconsin\r\ncame for permanent homes and six months was long enough to prove\r\nresidence. The effect of the shorter period would be to encourage\r\nforeigners to file their intentions sooner. It was admitted that the\r\nsix-months provision was carried in committee by a very narrow\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nThe attack on the article on alien suffrage was begun by an amendment\r\nto limit suffrage to citizens. It was alleged that the article as\r\nreported by the committee was unconstitutional and would cause\r\nCongress to reject the constitution. In reply the similar provisions\r\nin the constitutions of Ohio and Illinois were cited. The new\r\nconstitution of Illinois was cited by both parties to the controversy;\r\none claiming the change had occurred because of dissatisfaction with\r\nthe more liberal provision; the other that Illinois’ new constitution\r\nhad not yet been acted upon. Charges were freely made of\r\ndemagoguery--that the Democrats were toadying to the foreign vote. In\r\nreply, the Democrats appealed to the liberality and progressiveness of\r\ntheir party policies, and declared that the aliens, being taxed, were\r\nentitled to vote. The citizen amendment was defeated by a vote of 53\r\nto 16; and the suffrage article as originally reported by the\r\ncommittee was incorporated into the constitution. With the amendments\r\nrequired by the amendments to the Constitution of the United States,\r\nthe provision was part of the organic law of Wisconsin until 1912.\r\n\r\n                                         LOUISE P. KELLOGG.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [132] So given by Mrs. John Kinzie in _Wau Bun, The Early\r\n     Day in the Northwest_, (Caxton Club ed. Chicago, 1901) 252.\r\n     Isaac T. Smith in _Wisconsin Historical Collections_, VI,\r\n     424, explains that the Winnebago name “Koshkonong” meant\r\n     “the place where we shave.” He adds, however, that the\r\n     Potawatomi name for the lake meant “the lake we live on.”\r\n     This interpretation is also given by Rev.

LAPHAM AND THE GERMAN AIR RAIDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader may well be excused if at first sight he is puzzled over\r\nour title. What possible connection can there be between the simple\r\nWisconsin scholar, whose life of busy service for the betterment of\r\nhumanity terminated almost half a century ago, and the baby-killing\r\nair raids upon London and other English cities with which the soldiers\r\nof Emperor William are accustomed to divert themselves?\r\n\r\nGentle reader, we propose to show you. Increase A. Lapham delved in\r\nmany fields of learning, but chiefly he was a scientist and perhaps\r\nhis greatest single achievement was his practical conquest of the\r\nsecret of foretelling the weather. Now we learn, on the authority of\r\nthe London _Illustrated News_, that the imperial German government has\r\nutilized Lapham’s discovery to insure the success (or at least to\r\nminimize the danger) of its air raids on London. “When the east wind\r\nblows beware of air raids.” Thus might a modernized English edition of\r\n_Poor Richard’s Almanac_ read. Also, “When the night is moonlight,\r\nbeware of air raids,” but frequently moonlight nights are enjoyed sans\r\nthe nocturnal visitants. The twofold explanation is that the air\r\nraiders must have clear weather and it is desirable if not essential\r\nthat they have the wind behind them on the outward raid and in their\r\nfaces on the return journey, rather than vice versa. The Germans have\r\ncontrol of Europe from the North Sea far into Russia and so it is\r\npossible for their meteorological observation posts to give warning\r\nfor something like twelve hours in advance of any change in weather\r\nconditions coming down behind an east wind. As long, therefore, as\r\nthere is a steady wind across Europe anywhere between northeast and\r\nsoutheast those in charge of the raiding squadrons in Belgium have\r\nfull warning of what the weather is going to be like. Accordingly the\r\nfiendish flying brood can be sent forth in confident assurance that\r\nneither its arrival at its destination nor its return to the home\r\nstation will be frustrated by stormy weather.\r\n\r\nIncrease Lapham labored for years to promote his great discovery\r\nbecause he had a vision of the service it would be to mankind. One of\r\nhis most striking arguments for enlisting community action in the\r\npromotion of his work was a calculation of the number of lives and of\r\nvessels which annually would be saved from destruction on Lake\r\nMichigan alone. Happily for him he did not live to witness the\r\nspectacle of the world’s most efficient government perverting his\r\ngreat achievement to the promotion of the indiscriminate slaughter of\r\nthe men and women, the mothers and babies of the world’s greatest\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVE THE RELICS[134]\r\n\r\nThe original of the letter written by Horace Greeley, sometime near\r\nthe middle of the sixties, in reply to the application for advice of a\r\ndischarged soldier boy, and in which occurred the famous phrase, “Go\r\nwest, young man, and grow up with the country,” is supposed to have\r\nbeen destroyed, with other valuable historic papers, in a recent fire\r\nin Youngstown, Ohio.\r\n\r\nIt was superb advice profitably followed by thousands of young men,\r\nsires and grandsires of millions of the finest of western citizens of\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nBut--Why was that historic document in private possession? That was\r\nnot at all fit wit for our Youngstown friend to exhibit. In the safe\r\ncustody of the Ohio Historical Society that precious letter justly\r\nbelonged, and there it would repose securely now if prudence had but\r\nguided its owner.\r\n\r\nWhich raises the pertinent question--Have _you_ an historical souvenir\r\nthat is being endangered while you neglect to transfer it to the\r\nWisconsin State Historical Society? Wisconsin homes contain many\r\nmementoes that rightly belong in the historical society’s fireproof\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nAre _you_ playing safe? Let us not expose the lack of circumspection\r\nshown by the Youngstown antiquarian. Besides--Ten thousand persons can\r\nenjoy relics in the historical rooms where one does in a private home.\r\n\r\nTherefore--Be warned!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEWSPAPERS[135]\r\n\r\nIt is the glory of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin that\r\nDraper gathered into its collections the papers of the Ohio Valley\r\nmigrations, that Thwaites added the records of the fur trade, and that\r\nneither forgot while pursuing these remote and unique sources to\r\nassemble day after day the current accumulations of the people among\r\nwhom they lived. As the latter collector and editor loved to say: The\r\nhistory for tomorrow is preserved in the waste paper baskets of today.\r\nThe society that lays aside the policy of accumulating accessions to\r\ndevote itself to the conscious pursuit of particular treasures can\r\nnever become more useful than its curators or wiser than its\r\nsuperintendent. The greatest libraries are those whose growth has been\r\nchiefly in the routine addition, from year to year of all that has\r\nbeen regarded as worth saving, and of much more whose immediate value\r\nhas been doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe State Historical Society of Wisconsin has for so many years\r\nfollowed the practice of saving its daily newspapers, and adding to\r\nthem as opportunity occurs, that it now owns one of the notable\r\nAmerican collections. From the middle of the last century, when the\r\nstate came into being, the development of its people can be traced in\r\nthe detail which only the inquisitive county daily can follow. Its\r\nrelations to the Northwest and to the rest of the nation can be\r\nchecked in the selected files which have ever been cherished. Through\r\nthe wise foresight of its founders it owns the great sources for all\r\nof modern history--for in our day the course of the historian is more\r\nand more fundamentally laid among the newspapers.\r\n\r\nIt has not been altogether easy to build up this collection. A\r\nmetropolitan daily of today means twelve large volumes to be bound,\r\nshelved, and housed each year. The cubic contents of the sources know\r\nno limit. There is some room for fear that after they have been stored\r\naway they may rot in their bindings before any scholar uses them.\r\n\r\nBut no society which understands the course of modern history can fail\r\nto run the risk of dry-rot or to preserve such records as exist. For\r\nno period before the present is there such a factual reconstruction\r\npossible as we possess. No newspaper can lie and live--very long. The\r\nuser must correct for bias, and careless error, and malicious\r\nmisstatement, all of which occur in nearly every issue of any paper.\r\nBut no student can read a continuous series of files for twenty years\r\nwithout knowing that he has before him the truth, and more of the\r\ntruth than society has known in any earlier period.\r\n\r\nIn our judgment one of the great functions of any historical society\r\ntoday is to collect ephemeral literature, beginning with the\r\nnewspapers of its immediate region and extending as far as its money\r\nand its shelves permit. No Society should be too poor for the town\r\ndailies and one New York file. Larger societies may take in the\r\ncounty, or the region, as the area for their collections, and may\r\nincrease the selected list of remote journals to be preserved. All\r\nwill be judged in the future by the intelligence and patience in this\r\ndirection which their shelves may finally reveal. None can be\r\npermanently of greatest use with a policy such as is exposed in the\r\njournal of a sister society:\r\n\r\n“The State of * * * has thousands of them [newspapers] in the\r\nLibraries of the State House. Many of them are bound, others are\r\nunbound, tied in bundles and carefully stowed away. Their day is done;\r\nrarely has any one in our knowledge asked to examine any of these\r\nnewspapers for any date or facts. History has culled from them such\r\ntruths as could point a moral, or hold out a danger signal to the\r\nworld of the present time, and they are closed, perhaps never more to\r\nbe consulted.”\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVING THE PAPACY TO CHICAGO\r\n\r\nPossession of the faith by which mountains are removed is, we are\r\ninclined to think, the fundamental characteristic of the American\r\nspirit. To the American all things are possible because the true\r\nAmerican takes it for granted that to him nothing is impossible. The\r\nmanifestation of this spirit has its unpleasant--oftentimes its\r\nridiculous--side, of course; yet the possession of it has made\r\npossible the performance here in the New World of miracles as\r\nastonishing as any set forth in holy writ.\r\n\r\nBy popular consent the metropolis of our inland seas has long since\r\ncome to be regarded as perhaps the most striking exponent, among\r\ncities, of the characteristic American spirit. Throughout her history\r\nthe supreme confidence of her citizens in the city’s present greatness\r\nand future development, together with the will to transmute the\r\nprolific visions of her leaders into present realities, has\r\nconstituted her most valuable civic asset. We have seen no better\r\nillustration of this characteristic Chicago (and American) spirit than\r\nthe one contained in a story which William J. Onahan, a Chicago\r\nIrishman of sixty-four years’ standing relates. Meeting Mr. Armour on\r\na street corner at a time when, because of political turmoil in Italy\r\nthere was talk of the Pope’s seeking an asylum outside the peninsula,\r\nthe two stopped to talk for a moment, whereupon the captain of\r\nindustry calmly proposed that the papacy be brought to Chicago. Onahan\r\nundertook to explain something of the magnitude of the Pope’s\r\nresponsibilities, and the impossibility of the proposed removal from\r\nthe Eternal to the Windy City, with the following result:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Armour listened patiently to my harangue on the necessities of\r\nthe Pope, and then proposed another conundrum to me: ‘How much would\r\nit take to provide all these buildings?’\r\n\r\n“I did not know; could not guess. Would it take ten millions--twenty\r\nmillions?\r\n\r\n“‘Look here,’ he added, ‘you undertake this affair. You know how to\r\nmanage these things. You get the Pope to agree to come to Chicago. We\r\ncan arrange and provide everything suitable for his needs.’\r\n\r\n“‘Why, how on earth could you do these things?’ I asked in\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\n“‘I’ll tell you my idea,’ he said. ‘We will get a big tract of land\r\noutside Chicago, ten or twenty thousand acres. We will build necessary\r\noffices, a palace, a great Cathedral, whatever may be necessary. Half\r\nthat land set apart and turned over to the Pope, don’t you see that we\r\nwill make enough out of the other half to pay for the whole business?’\r\n\r\n“I was dumfounded at the audacity of the idea, the ingenuity and\r\nmethod of carrying it out, and the characteristic Chicago\r\naim--‘there’s money in it.’ When, many years afterwards I saw the\r\nwonderful ‘White City’--the World’s Fair--its marvelous architectural\r\nbeauty, the vastness and symmetry of its buildings, the beauty of all\r\nthe arrangements, I said to myself, Chicago could indeed, if put to\r\nit, build a new Eternal City.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     [134] Reprinted from the editorial column of the Madison\r\n     _Democrat_, January 22, 1918.\r\n\r\n     [135] Contributed by Prof. Frederic L. Paxson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\n“CAMOUFLAGE” AND “EATLESS DAYS” TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war in Europe has revived, and brought into common use, in all\r\nlanguages, the term “camouflage,” denoting any contrivance to hide or\r\ndisguise by one side to deceive and confuse the enemy. This term, if\r\nderived from the French _camouflet_, pronounced cam-u-flay, appears in\r\nthe _International Encyclopedia_ and is defined as: “A stinking\r\ncompound in paper cases used in siege attacks to blow into the faces\r\nof sappers and miners to confuse them.” The word must have been\r\nburied, for I find no mention of it in any other encyclopædia. The use\r\nof the term in a wider sense appears in _The Letters to Authors_, of\r\nVoltaire, dated 1730, where he savagely characterizes a rival writer\r\nof that period thus in rhyme:\r\n\r\n   Rousseau sujet au Camouflet,\r\n   Fut autrefois chasse dit-on.\r\n   Du theatre à coups de sifflet,\r\n   Du Paris à coups de baton.\r\n   Chez les Germains chacun fait comme,\r\n   Il c’est garanti du fagot.\r\n   Il a fait enfin le devot,\r\n   Ne pouvant faire l’honnette homme.\r\n\r\nThere is no set of Voltaire in English in Monroe, hence I translate\r\nwithout rhyme the French copy:\r\n\r\n  “Rousseau because of _camouflet_,\r\n   Was sometimes chased they say\r\n   From the theaters with storms of hisses,\r\n   From Paris with blows of clubs.\r\n   By Germans, each one well knows,\r\n   He is guaranteed the fagot.\r\n   He could not be an honest man,\r\n   Therefore became religious.”\r\n\r\nI find by the same author, under the title, _Misfortunes of Charles I_:\r\n\r\n     “Parliament ordered the public burning by the hangman of the\r\n     tract written by James the First wherein he states that it\r\n     is proper for people to have sport and amusements after\r\n     divine service on Sundays. The same parliament names one day\r\n     each week as a day of fasting and ordered that the value of\r\n     the food thus saved be paid to help defray the expense of\r\n     the civil war then raging.”\r\n\r\n                             Yours truly,\r\n                                           JOHN LUCHSINGER.\r\nMonroe, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER’S WISCONSIN INVESTMENTS\r\n\r\nAt the time of the appearance of the communications relating to\r\nWebster’s western investments in the first and second numbers of this\r\nmagazine I chanced to see in the _Personal Recollections_ of Robert S.\r\nRantoul (Cambridge, Mass., Privately Printed, 1916) a reference to the\r\nsame subject which seems worth calling to the attention of those\r\ninterested in western history.\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Recollections_ says that the early death of his\r\nfather, Robert Rantoul, was in part due to the financial disaster\r\nwhich overtook him--he died at forty-seven--and proceeds to explain\r\nthe circumstances. He had known that his father spent much time in the\r\nMiddle West between 1845 and 1850 and that he had a high estimate of\r\nthe economic and political possibilities of the upper Mississippi\r\nValley; but it was not until long after his father’s death that he\r\nlearned something of the speculations and reverses in that region\r\nwhich hastened it.\r\n\r\nThe facts were as follows: Rantoul, Rufus Choate, and Caleb Cushing\r\nwere trustees in a scheme, in which Webster, Cass, and a few others\r\nwere also concerned, to get control of the headwaters of the\r\nMississippi, saw the lumber, and float it down to markets in the\r\nrapidly growing cities and towns of the Middle West. Cass had shown\r\nthat such a plan was practicable; but the associates knew, also, that\r\nthere was mineral wealth in the region of Fort Snelling. Indian\r\nimplements of that vicinity were inlaid with lead and copper. They had\r\nill-timed, if not over-sanguine, hopes of great gain therefrom. The\r\ntrustees managed everything and issued stock certificates in December,\r\n1845. They had received a charter the preceding August as the St.\r\nCroix and Lake Superior Mineral Company. Nothing but trouble followed.\r\nAfter a dam had been built at St. Anthony’s Falls their land titles\r\nwere attacked and their logs were carried away by a spring flood.\r\nCushing, who was to have been governor of the new territory, went to\r\nthe Mexican War. Choate was too absorbed in his profession and too\r\nindifferent to business matters to pay attention to the management of\r\nthe undertaking. The whole burden fell upon Rantoul and was too great\r\nfor him to bear. After his death in 1852 Cushing gave some attention\r\nto the business but Rantoul’s executors would not coöperate and his\r\ninterest in the project lapsed with loss of the money and labor which\r\nhe had devoted to the enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe son also remarks on the fact that his father was one of the\r\nincorporators of the Illinois Central Railroad, wrote its charter, and\r\npassed it through the legislature, where--as is well known--Abraham\r\nLincoln was the opposing counsel.\r\n\r\n                             Yours truly,\r\n                                        ASA CURRIER TILTON.\r\nMadison, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURVEY OF HISTORICAL ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIETY AND THE STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-one new members were added to the State Historical Society\r\nduring the quarter ending March 31, 1918, eight to the life and\r\nthirteen to the annual membership class. In addition, two annual\r\nmembers of the Society, Col. Marshall Cousins, of Eau Claire, and\r\nOscar G. Boisseau, of Holden, Mo., transferred to the life membership\r\ngroup. The new life members are: John S. Allen, John N. Cadby,\r\nWilliard O. Hotchkiss, Edward J. B. Schubring, Halsten J. Thorkelson,\r\nMadison; Adam A. Beck, Rev. James M. McManus, William A. Roblier, of\r\nColoma; John H. Tweedy, Jr., of Milwaukee. The new annual members are:\r\nProf. John G. Callan, Peter J. Connor, Prof. Charles A. Smith, Miss K.\r\nBernice Stewart, Mrs. Magnus Swensen, of Madison; W. I. Goodland, E.\r\nW. Leach, of Racine; Azel C. Hough, of Janesville; Andrew J. Hutton,\r\nof Waukesha; John B. MacHarg, of Appleton; Charles D. Stewart, of\r\nHartford; R. E. Van Matre, of Darlington; John P. DeMeritt, of White\r\nPlains, New York.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMany interesting additions to the Library’s collection of non-current\r\nnewspaper files were made during the first quarter of 1918. By far the\r\nmost important is the _Illinois Intelligencer_, published at Kaskaskia\r\nand (later) Vandalia, for the years 1817-31. This paper was the first\r\nto be published in Illinois, its name in the beginning being the\r\n_Illinois Herald_. Through the courtesy of the University of Illinois\r\nLibrary our Society has been afforded the opportunity to make a\r\nphotostatic reproduction of the file for the fourteen years included\r\nin the period noted. From the widow of the founder and publisher, Rev.\r\nI. L. Hauser, has been received the file for the first five years,\r\n1869-74, of the Milwaukee _Index_, later and better known as the\r\n_Christian Statesman_. Other Wisconsin files acquired include the\r\nAlgoma _Record_, 1910-18, and six issues (out of a total of ten\r\npublished) of the _Bugle Blast_, Lake Mills’ first newspaper. From\r\nMinnesota has come a complete file of the short-lived Winona _Daily\r\nNews_, published from September 14 to October 7, 1916. Other files\r\nfrom without the state include: Lawrenceburg _Indiana Palladium_,\r\nApril-December, 1825; Indianapolis _Locomotive_, 1850-52; Logansport\r\n_Journal_, April-December, 1864; Cincinnati _Brauerei Arbeiter\r\nZeitung_, 1910-17; Baltimore _Manufacturers Record_, 1916-18; New York\r\n_Army and Navy Journal_, 1902-10; New York _Fatherland_, 1914-17;\r\nTokyo _Japan Mail_, 1915-17.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThrough the agency of the historical committee of the Congregational\r\nChurch in Wisconsin an important collection of yearbooks, church\r\nperiodicals, pamphlets, books, and other material on Congregationalism,\r\nwhich had been gathered at the business headquarters of the church in\r\nMadison, has been turned over to the State Historical Society. Much of\r\nthe collection thus received duplicates material already owned by the\r\nLibrary; it will go in due time to swell the resources of some sister\r\ninstitution which lacks and needs it. The remainder constitutes a\r\nwelcome addition to our own important collection of material in the\r\nfield of Congregational church history. Thus another step is taken in\r\nthe process of making the State Historical Library the repository of\r\nall available material pertaining to the history of the several\r\nreligious denominations of Wisconsin. For the latest acquisition\r\nparticular obligation is acknowledged to Rev. John N. Davidson, Rev.\r\nS. T. Kidder, and Rev. Henry A. Miner, Congregational ministers, all\r\nof Madison. Their active and intelligent interest in making the\r\nsources of their denominational history accessible to scholars is\r\nworthy of emulation. Who will be next to “come across” on behalf of\r\nhis own denomination?\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMrs. Anna Roberts Beagle, of Menomonie, has presented the Society with\r\nthree interesting family heirlooms. One is a Welsh Bible brought to\r\nAmerica in 1817 by her father, Richard Roberts, who in later life was\r\nfor many years a resident and justice of the peace at Menomonie.\r\nAnother is a sword carried by her father’s brother, Daniel Roberts, in\r\nthe War of 1812. The third is an English hunting knife brought from\r\nEngland in 1817, which according to the tradition of the family has\r\nbeen in its possession for many generations.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nFrom Fred M. Griswold of Lake Mills have been received six issues of\r\nthe Lake Mills _Bugle Blast_, publication of which as a monthly was\r\nbegun in December, 1863. Mr. Griswold states that the _Bugle Blast_\r\nwas Lake Mills’ first paper, and that only ten issues were published\r\nin all. It was a modest sheet, put out, apparently, in spare time by\r\nthe proprietor, who also played the rôles of editor and devil as well.\r\nThe annual subscription price was twenty-five cents at first, but\r\nbefore long the cost of materials compelled an increase to thirty\r\ncents. The file which Mr. Griswold has presented constitutes an\r\ninteresting addition to the Society’s collection of Wisconsin\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nDuring the month of March, a special exhibit of Dutch war cartoons,\r\nlent for the purpose by Prof. Arnold Dresden, was made in the State\r\nHistorical Museum. They accompanied the issues of the newspaper _De\r\nNieuwe Amsterdamer_, and are the work of the famous Dutch cartoonists,\r\nP. Vanderham, Willy Sluiter, and Jan Sluyters. The cartoons measure\r\n12½ by 19 inches in size and nearly all of them are printed in colors.\r\nThey deal with such subjects as the German war horrors, war conditions\r\nin Holland, the neutrals, and peace. The most striking of the latter\r\nclass is one in which the Angel of Peace is seen stooping over the\r\nworld, which, porcupine-like, is completely covered with protruding\r\nbayonets. The translated inscription reads: “I do not find a spot\r\nwhere I can take hold of him.”\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe State Historical Museum, in order to complete certain of its\r\ncollections, is especially anxious to secure samples of the following\r\nimplements and utensils formerly in use in Wisconsin and other states:\r\nA pomace knife, mead stick, hearth brush, wooden-toothed rake, corn\r\nsheller, cheese tester, farrier’s shave, sheep yoke, goose yoke,\r\nmilking stool, wool comb, tape loom or heddle frame, rundlets, wooden\r\ntankard, wooden dishes, stirring stick, butter molds, milk skimmer,\r\nearthenware foot-warmer, magnifier of the kind formerly placed in\r\nfront of candles or sconces, fleam, wooden pitch pipe, and a wooden\r\nprism.\r\n\r\nSamples of early American china are also desired, pewter ware, a hand\r\nlamp, miner’s lamp, tea canister, wooden sugar-box, butter bowl, mush\r\npaddle, hickory hay fork, old hand-made keys, and old-style door\r\nknocker. Gifts of such specimens will be greatly appreciated and will\r\nassist the museum in its work with university students and the public\r\nschools of the state.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIn March, 1918, Magnus Swenson, chairman of the State Council of\r\nDefense, appointed a War History Commission for Wisconsin, and\r\ndelegated to it the work of collecting for permanent preservation all\r\nthe material that can be obtained relating to our state’s share in the\r\nGreat War. The plan is the outgrowth of steps taken early in the war\r\nby the National Board for Historical Service in Washington to make a\r\ncomplete and monumental collection of the material pertaining to\r\nAmerica’s part in this great struggle.\r\n\r\nThe commission consists of M. M. Quaife, Madison, chairman; W. W.\r\nBartlett, Eau Claire, C. R. Fish, Madison, J. H. A. Lacher, Waukesha,\r\nW. N. Parker, Madison, A. H. Sanford, La Crosse, and Captain H. A.\r\nWhipple, Waterloo. John W. Oliver, Madison, was named director of the\r\ncommission. At a meeting held in the office of the Superintendent of\r\nthe State Historical Society on March 8, the commission decided to\r\nbegin at once the work that had been assigned. The State Historical\r\nLibrary in Madison was selected as the headquarters for the\r\ncommission, and from there the work is being directed. Local war\r\nhistory committees have been appointed in every county of the state,\r\ncharged with the specific function of collecting and preserving all\r\nthe records relating to that particular county’s activity in the war.\r\nBy coöperating with the county councils of defense, the public\r\nlibraries, the local historical societies, and the schools, it is\r\nhoped that every record and news item possessing historical value will\r\nbe saved for the use of future workers in compiling a final history of\r\nWisconsin’s part in the war.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIn line with the foregoing activity, a movement has been undertaken by\r\nthe University of Wisconsin and the State Historical Society, working\r\nin conjunction, to develop at Madison a comprehensive war collection,\r\nwhich shall adequately serve the needs of future investigators. A\r\nspecial fund has been provided, deemed adequate to the purpose in\r\nview, and Dr. Asa C. Tilton, a trained bibliographer and historian,\r\nhas been secured to serve as curator of the War Collection and direct\r\nthe work of collecting. The special drive for historical materials\r\nthus put under way will be conducted in close coördination with the\r\nordinary work of the Historical Library and the library and other\r\ndepartments of the University. As a result of it, there should be\r\ndeveloped at Madison such a comprehensive war collection for the use\r\nof students and research workers as the New York Public Library and\r\none or two others are developing in the East. As far as known, nowhere\r\nin the West, outside of Madison, is such a collection being developed.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe forty-sixth annual meeting of the Outagamie County Pioneers’\r\nAssociation was held at Appleton the latter part of February. A\r\nbusiness program was held in the forenoon, a dinner at noon, and a\r\nliterary and musical program in the afternoon. Addresses were given by\r\nMayor Faville, Postmaster Keller, Judge Spencer, and others.\r\nThroughout the addresses the patriotic note was dominant.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe forty-third annual meeting of the Reedsburg Old Settlers’\r\nAssociation was held February 15, 1918, under unfavorable weather\r\nconditions. A picnic dinner was eaten, and a miscellaneous program of\r\nsongs, addresses, and instrumental music was given. The treasurer’s\r\nreport showed a balance on hand of $191. Officers elected for the\r\nensuing year were John P. Stone, president; C. M. Kester, vice\r\npresident; Elsie Root, secretary; F. M. Baker, treasurer.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOn March 26, in the Kellogg Public Library, the Green Bay Historical\r\nSociety held a scheduled meeting. On the program were papers by W. M.\r\nConway of the State Highway Commission on “Roads of Wisconsin and How\r\nThey Can Be Made More Interesting”; by Mrs. W. D. Cooke on “Shantytown\r\nin 1820”; and by J. P. Schumacher on “The Site of the First Church\r\nBuilt in Shantytown by Father Mazzuchelli.”\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAn attractively printed program of the Sauk County Historical Society\r\nrecords a noteworthy list of activities for 1917-18, the\r\norganization’s thirteenth year. The annual meeting occurred October 5,\r\n1917, the principal address being given by M. M. Quaife on “The Angel\r\nof Wisconsin.” On March 1, 1918 a second meeting was held, at which\r\npapers or addresses were given on the following subjects: “The Coming\r\nof the Circuit Rider in Wisconsin,” by Rev. W. R. Irish; “The First\r\nMurder Trial in Baraboo,” by R. T. Warner, of Everett, Washington;\r\n“The First Permanent Settler at Baraboo,” by Louise P. Kellogg;\r\n“Pioneer Occupations,” by N. G. Abbott, of Eureka Springs, Arkansas.\r\nThe program for the meeting appointed for April 5 consisted of the\r\nfollowing papers: “When I ‘Broke Into’ Sauk County Politics,” by John\r\nM. True; “Wisconsin Map by I. A. Lapham,” by H. E. French; “Additional\r\nReminiscences of Ableman--A Sequel,” by Eva Alexander; and “Indians at\r\nBaraboo in Pioneer Times,” by M. H. Mould.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nA pamphlet describing Wisconsin’s participation in the exposition held\r\nin Chicago in the summer of 1915 to commemorate the semicentennial of\r\nthe emancipation of the Negro has recently been issued. Hon. S. A.\r\nCook, Neenah, president, Hon. George P. Hambrecht, Madison, treasurer,\r\nand Samuel R. Banks, Madison, secretary, formed the personnel of the\r\ncommission appointed by the Governor to represent Wisconsin. The\r\ncreditable progress made by the black man along lines of industry and\r\nart was illustrated in convincing fashion by the exhibits. The report\r\nof the progress made along educational lines is no less worthy of\r\nnote. A message from Governor Phillip on Wisconsin Day said:\r\n“Certainly they have done enough to merit our heartiest praise and\r\ncoöperation and to inspire the hope that the problem which confronted\r\nthe white man when this vast population was given freedom will be\r\nsolved by the help of the leaders of the race itself.”\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAt the time of going to press tentative arrangements have been made\r\nfor a joint meeting of the State Historical Society and the Sauk\r\nCounty Historical Society to be held at the site of old Fort Winnebago\r\nnear Portage on Labor Day, 1918. There will be a picnic dinner, but as\r\nthe place is in the outskirts of Portage any who prefer to eat at the\r\nhotel may easily arrange to do so. A short historical address will be\r\ngiven, followed by visits to the site of the fort and the “Agency\r\nhouse,” the latter made famous by Mrs. Kinzie in her book, _Wau Bun_.\r\nNear by, also, may be seen the place of the famous Fox-Wisconsin\r\nportage, first crossed by white men, so far as our knowledge goes, by\r\nLouis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette in 1673, and the old United States\r\nmilitary cemetery. Such a gathering should attract a large number of\r\nvisitors from all the surrounding communities.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nDr. A. Gerend, of Cato, addressed the Manitowoc County Historical\r\nSociety on the evening of March 8, on the subject, “The Indians of\r\nManitowoc County.” Dr. Gerend is an industrious investigator in the\r\nlocal field of Indian history and archeology, and has supplied some\r\ninteresting material to the State Historical Library.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOn February 10, 1918, the First Baptist Church of Sheboygan Falls\r\ncelebrated its eightieth anniversary. Organized February 11, 1838,\r\nthis church is ten years older than the Commonwealth itself. The\r\npresent church building was dedicated December 18, 1850, and like the\r\norganization which it houses, is one of the oldest in Wisconsin. In\r\nthe eighty years of its existence the church has had twenty pastors,\r\nten clerks, and six treasurers.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe Catholic diocese of Green Bay was created by a breve of Pope Pius\r\nIX, March 3, 1868. The semicentennial of its birth was celebrated\r\nthroughout the parishes of the diocese during the first week of March,\r\n1918. Upon organization fifty years ago the diocese had 26 priests, 27\r\nparishes and 41 missions, 12 schools, and a population of 40,000.\r\nToday it contains 164 parishes and 75 missions with churches; 106\r\nparish schools with over 24,000 pupils enrolled; besides 3 colleges\r\nfor men, an academy for women, 2 Indian schools, 9 hospitals, and a\r\npopulation of 149,000.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe Mexican War ended seventy years ago, and but few active\r\nparticipants in it now remain alive. One Mexican War veteran was James\r\nLaw, of Madison, who died January 30, 1918. Had he lived until\r\nFebruary 21, he would have been ninety years of age. Mr. Law was one\r\nof Madison’s early stonemasons, and is said to have worked on the old\r\nCapitol building.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nGeorge B. Ferry, of Milwaukee, probably Wisconsin’s most eminent\r\narchitect, died January 29, 1917. Among the notable buildings designed\r\nby Mr. Ferry are the Milwaukee Public Library, and the splendid home\r\nof the State Historical Society at Madison.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nA joint meeting of the Wisconsin Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters\r\nwith the Wisconsin Archeological Society was held in the assembly room\r\nof the State Historical Society, April 11 and 12, 1918. Of the two\r\ndozen or more papers read, the following were devoted particularly to\r\nWisconsin history: “Additional Wisconsin Peace Medals,” by Charles E.\r\nBrown; “The State Collection of War Posters,” by Ruth O. Roberts; “The\r\nWork of the Wisconsin War History Commission,” by John W. Oliver. The\r\nother papers were devoted chiefly to archeological and scientific\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Archeological Society held its annual meeting in the\r\nlecture room of the Milwaukee Public Museum on Monday evening, March\r\n18, 1918. The meeting was well attended by members from Milwaukee and\r\nvarious other points in the state. At the business meeting the\r\nfollowing officers were elected: Dr. Samuel A. Barrett, Milwaukee,\r\npresident; Dr. E. J. W. Notz, Milwaukee, John P. Schumacher, Green\r\nBay, A. T. Newman, Bloomer, Dr. F. E. Dayton, New London, and Charles\r\nG. Schoewe, Milwaukee, vice presidents. W. H. Vogel and William A.\r\nPhillips were elected members of the executive board, and Lee R.\r\nWhitney, treasurer. The secretary’s annual report, read by Charles E.\r\nBrown, shows that the society has been active in the field of\r\nexploration and publication.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nDe Have Norton of the Fourth Wisconsin Infantry (later the Fourth\r\nWisconsin Cavalry) died at his home in Hingham, Wisconsin, February\r\n20, 1918. From Mrs. Norton the Society has received about twenty-five\r\nCivil War letters written by her late husband to his parents from 1861\r\nto 1865. Mr. Norton served from June, 1861, until the close of the\r\nwar. He was an intelligent and entertaining correspondent and it is a\r\nmatter for regret that so few of his letters have been preserved. The\r\nfollowing citations from two of his letters written, the one at Camp\r\nUtley, Racine, on the eve of departure for the front in July, 1861,\r\nthe other from Montgomery, Alabama, in May, 1865, afford a pleasing\r\npicture of the spirit which animated our Civil War soldiers. “I shall\r\nnot see you again so good by Father & Mother. God be with you till I\r\nsee you again. I think the cause which I go to defend is worth the\r\nsacrifice which I make, for I do make a great sacrifice. I leave home\r\nand all I love to stake my life for my Country. I go willingly, as for\r\nyou, don’t fear for me I shall do well enough. If I never return you\r\nwill know that I died in the cause of Liberty & truth”\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAnd four years later: “I am safe and sound as ever. We have had a long\r\nand tedious march. * * * There was not a shot exchanged with the\r\nenemy. The rebels are all at home. the towns are full of them. we mix\r\nall together the best of friends. it looks nice to see the gray\r\nuniform and blue uniform together. Well father after four long years\r\nof blood and terror the war is over. You can imagine the feelings of\r\nthe soldiers on the subject.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DINSDALE PAPERS\r\n\r\nRev. Matthew Dinsdale was born at Askrigg, Yorkshire, England, July\r\n14, 1815, and received his education at a boy’s school in his native\r\nvalley Wensleydale. This school was on a foundation existing from the\r\ntime of Queen Elizabeth, and one of its first trustees was Ivor\r\nDinsdale, an ancestor of Matthew. The latter came to the United States\r\nin 1844 on the packet _St. George_, 1200 tons, one of the finest\r\ntransatlantic steamers of its time. After a three months’ journey he\r\narrived at Kenosha (then Southport), Wisconsin, on the eighth of\r\nOctober, and was soon among friends who had preceded him and settled\r\nat English Prairie just across the Wisconsin line in McHenry County,\r\nIllinois. A month later Mr. Dinsdale was received into the quarterly\r\nconference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, having brought\r\ncredentials from the Wesleyan Conference in England. The next year he\r\njoined the Rock River Conference and was assigned to Potosi circuit in\r\nthe lead-mining district of southwestern Wisconsin. The succeeding\r\nyear Mr. Dinsdale was appointed to the Lake Winnebago circuit, then a\r\nmission district including preaching stations among the Brothertown\r\nIndians, at Oshkosh, and other new settlements along the lake shore.\r\nHe virtually lived in the saddle, going from cabin to cabin, and\r\ngathering the settlers together for a Sunday service. Often he slept\r\nby the roadside or in the woods. His health was impaired by the severe\r\nstrain of his circuit-riding days, and in 1849 he joined a group of\r\nfriends who visited the gold regions of California. After over two\r\nyears in this pioneer work, Mr. Dinsdale returned to England, and\r\nthere in April, 1853 he married Mary Anne Mann, of York. Returning to\r\nAmerica with his young English bride, he applied once more for\r\nadmission to the Methodist Church, and in 1858 entered the West\r\nWisconsin Conference. Thereafter for nineteen years he served in many\r\npastorates in the southwestern part of the state. In 1872 and 1873 he\r\nwas preacher in charge at Madison. Four years later he retired from\r\nthe active ministry, and spent his declining years at Linden, Iowa\r\nCounty, where, on April 15, 1898, he passed away.\r\n\r\nHis only surviving daughter, Mrs. Magnus Swenson, of Madison, has\r\nrecently presented to the Historical Society many of her father’s\r\npapers. Among them are three diaries of considerable historical value.\r\nThe first describes the voyage from England to America, the early days\r\nin this country, the work and events of pioneer life, “hewing bees,”\r\nhouse-raisings, rail-splittings, hog-killings, and the like,\r\ninterspersed with descriptions of the weather, the climate, and the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe second, or California diary, is perhaps the most interesting of\r\nthe number. Leaving Linden, Wisconsin, November 3, 1849, the traveler\r\nwent via Milwaukee, Buffalo, and Albany to New York City whence he\r\nsailed December 1 for Panama. Thereafter we have a daily account until\r\nthe landing, January 21, 1850, at the new city of San Francisco, which\r\nhe thus characterizes: “San Francisco I think will become a great\r\nplace. Its location is good convenient and pleasant and more still is\r\nhealthy.” Thence the young minister sought the mining camps, digging\r\nduring the week and preaching on Sunday. Here for example is a typical\r\nentry: “Sunday 19 Jany 1851. A Captn (Sea) told me _how_ he came to be\r\nin the mines. Lost his vessel and came to San Francisco to purchase\r\nanother. There he took the _fever_ and came to dig: Has made but\r\nlittle, Spoke of the misery caused to familes by the gold discovery.\r\nHis case that of thousands. Leave all to mine and then make nothing.”\r\nMr. Dinsdale’s case was not of this character. The fifth of June,\r\n1853, the assay of his gold at the Philadelphia mint amounted to\r\n$4,094.13.\r\n\r\nThe third journal was written when in service as agent of the\r\nChristian Commission in the spring of 1865 in the vicinity of\r\nNashville. The writer visited the camps and hospitals, distributed\r\npapers and Bibles, read and prayed with the soldiers, and in some\r\ncases took their dying messages.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the diaries, the papers include many letters of\r\nhistorical interest. All those written home to England from the time\r\nthe young emigrant arrived at New York until he left there five years\r\nlater for California have fortunately been preserved. The writer had a\r\ngood command of language and a gift for clear and lucid expression,\r\nand he portrays his first experiences in the New World with delightful\r\nvigor and freshness. He relates his first days in America, the prices\r\nof commodities and the modes and discomforts of traveling. He had an\r\nespecial fondness for natural scenery, and his descriptions even of so\r\nhackneyed a subject as Niagara Falls, do not pall upon the reader.\r\nMore important are the accounts he gives of conditions in our\r\nTerritory during its formative years--at first in the southeast, then\r\nin the more settled southwestern portion he pictures the life of the\r\nfrontier with truth and vigor. Most valuable of all, perhaps, is the\r\ndescription he gives of the Lake Winnebago region when the rapid\r\ningress of new settlers was at its height, and the Indians were\r\nretreating before the American advance. Among the experiences he\r\ndetails were those of a visit to a Menominee Indian payment on the\r\nshores of Lake Poygan, where his clear observation of conditions among\r\nthe retiring race are of peculiar value to the historian of the\r\ntribesmen. In the letters of advice which he gave to relatives who\r\nintended to emigrate, nothing was forgotten, and their detailed\r\nnarration presents a full picture of the difficulties and necessities\r\nof the early immigrants from Great Britain, and the courage required\r\nto undertake the long and oft-times dangerous voyage.\r\n\r\nA series of later letters describes the writer’s experience in the\r\nwork of the Christian Commission during the Civil War.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole the Dinsdale Papers are a valuable addition to the\r\ncollections of our Society, illustrating as they so well do the\r\nexperiences of an intelligent, educated immigrant during the formative\r\nperiod of territorial days. It is to be hoped that many more such\r\ngroups of papers, now preserved in private hands, will ultimately find\r\ntheir way into our custody where they will be of value to the history\r\nof this state.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LADD PAPERS\r\n\r\nDr. Otto L. Schmidt, of Chicago, a life member of the Society, has\r\npresented an important collection of letters and documents received by\r\nDr. Azel Ladd while serving in 1851 and 1852 as state superintendent\r\nof public instruction. For the most part they consist of appeals to\r\nthe state officer to interpret the school law for local communities,\r\nand the resolving of disputes and difficulties between the teachers\r\nand the officials. Many of the letters are requests for information\r\nwith regard to the allotments of school money, and a few have to do\r\nwith the lease or sale of school lands. A considerable number carry\r\nthe endorsement “Library returns.” These contain reports of the number\r\nof books in the school libraries under the law requiring one-tenth of\r\nthe state allotments to be expended for books. Incidentally from these\r\nletters much may be learned of the early educational history of our\r\nstate--the short terms of the schools, the qualifications and salaries\r\nof the teachers, the number and conduct of the pupils. From some of\r\nthese letters may be seen the educational conditions among our foreign\r\nimmigrants. Complaints are frequent of teachers that cannot write or\r\nspeak English. One letter asks the question, later so pertinent in our\r\neducational politics, whether the reading of the Bible constitutes a\r\nbreach of Section 3, Article 10 of the Wisconsin Constitution. Another\r\nwriter, defending the character of his daughter, a school teacher at\r\nMoundville, sends the Superintendent a specimen of her efforts in\r\nverse, which have been much admired. There are nearly a thousand\r\npapers in the collection, which constitute an important guide to the\r\nearly history of education in Wisconsin. Practically all of the\r\nletters belong to the years 1851 and 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME RECENT PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\n  HOLAND, HJALMAR R., _History of Door County, Wisconsin. The\r\n    County Beautiful._ (Two volumes, 459, 480, $21, Chicago,\r\n    1917.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a good example of the type of county subscription history\r\nwhich flourishes in the Middle West. The author had at his disposal an\r\nunusually attractive storehouse of material from which to construct\r\nhis narrative; the field was a virgin one, no history of Door County\r\nhaving ever been written before; the writer is a man of university\r\neducation, a long-time resident of the county, and an enthusiast on\r\nthe subject of local history. With such conditions prevailing it is\r\nnot surprising that the work which has resulted should constitute a\r\ngood example of the type to which it belongs.\r\n\r\nThe second volume of the two is filled with the usual collection of\r\ncommercial biographies, for which the promoters of the work are\r\nresponsible rather than the author of the history. Volume one, in\r\nwhich alone his name appears on the title-page, contains the history\r\nof the county which gives title to the work. It comprises fifty\r\nchapters and an appendix. The first nine chapters deal with the usual\r\npreliminary topics pertaining to geography, discovery and exploration,\r\nthe Indians, and the French period. It is impracticable to classify\r\nthe remaining forty-one chapters further than to note that they cover,\r\nalong with many other subjects, sketches of the several towns of the\r\ncounty, and of the more important types of social and industrial\r\nactivity of its people. Thus there are chapters on schools, banking,\r\npolitical organizations, churches, highways, newspapers, and\r\nindustries. More unusual than these are those on lighthouses,\r\nPeninsula State Park, Rock, Chambers, and Washington islands, and the\r\nSturgeon Bay Canal. Interspersed are several chapters (such as “A Man\r\nof Iron: a Tale of Death’s Door,” “David Kennison,” “The Sage of\r\nShivering Sands”) which seem either to have no logical place in the\r\nbook or to be given a prominence disproportionate to their importance.\r\nThere is little perceptible logic about the order of arrangement of\r\nthese many chapters, and one does not gain, from a reading of the\r\nbook, any clear impression of the progressive unfolding of the\r\ncounty’s history and development.\r\n\r\nThe author possesses an unusual command of the English language,\r\nnotwithstanding his birth on foreign soil, and the volume is\r\nentertainingly written. Both the history itself, and the style of the\r\nnarrative would have been improved, however, if greater restraint had\r\nbeen imposed by the author. Journalistic throughout, at its best the\r\nstyle of the narrative is fascinating; at the opposite extreme it is\r\noftentimes exuberant as to style and of questionable taste as to\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe January, 1918, number of the _Wisconsin Archeologist_ contains a\r\nsurvey of the Indian remains in Door County, made by J. P. Schumacher\r\nof Green Bay. The survey shows that these consist chiefly of village\r\nand camp sites and burial places, comparatively few mounds having been\r\nfound in the county. The author states that several alleged mounds\r\nhave proved upon investigation to be either grass-grown windfalls or\r\nsand dunes. One of the most valuable parts of the bulletin is the\r\nsection devoted to place names in Door County. In preparing this, the\r\nauthor was assisted by Dr. Alphonse Gerend, of Cato.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nTwo timely military articles appear in the January, 1918, number of\r\nthe _Iowa Journal of History and Politics_.

Upham\r\nhas an especially interesting article on “Arms and Equipment for the\r\nIowa Troops in the Civil War.” A reprint of the early reports by\r\nCaptain W. Bowling Guion and Lieutenant John C. Fremont in 1841\r\nconcerning the Des Moines River is included in this issue.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe State Historical Society of Iowa has published a volume entitled\r\n_Marches of the Dragoons in the Mississippi Valley_, by Louis Pelzer.\r\nIt describes the marches, campaigns, and military activities of the\r\nFirst Regiment of the United States Dragoons between the years 1833\r\nand 1850. The services of this military unit during the period\r\nmentioned consisted of frontier defense work, garrison duty, marches,\r\nexploring expeditions, and enforcement of federal laws. For those who\r\nare interested in the army life and activities on our extensive\r\nfrontier during the second quarter of the nineteenth century, the book\r\nhas more than a local value.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Freeman, of Menomonie, a member of the State Historical\r\nSociety, is the author of an extended article on “Early Menomonie, Its\r\nPhysical Appearance, Its Enterprises and Its Aims,” published in the\r\n_Dunn County News_, January 10, 1918.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nDuring the early winter John Hicks of Oshkosh was publishing in his\r\npaper, the Oshkosh _Northwestern_, a narrative of his life under the\r\ncaption “Fifty Years of Oshkosh--A Retrospect.” The last installment\r\ntold interestingly of his diplomatic career in South America.

Aside from its present interest to the community itself, the\r\ngeneral historian of Wisconsin cannot fail to find such a detailed\r\nnarrative as this of great value to him in his larger task of writing\r\nthe history of the state as a whole.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThose of our readers who are interested in the publications of our\r\nSociety dealing with the Lewis and Clark expedition will find in the\r\nJanuary number of the _Missouri Historical Review_ an article\r\ndescribing the great system of transportation that developed in later\r\nyears along the route followed by these early explorers. The article\r\nis by Professor H. A. Trexler, of the University of Montana, and is\r\nentitled, “Missouri-Montana Highways.” A second article, dealing with\r\nthe travel and commerce on the Overland Trail, is promised for a later\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe January, 1918, number of the _Michigan History Magazine_ contains\r\na paper by Edward G. Holden on “Carl Schurz in Michigan,” the author\r\nhaving been associated with Schurz on the Detroit _Post_ during the\r\nsixties. Other articles in this issue are: “Indian Legends of Northern\r\nMichigan,” by John C. Wright; “History of the Equal Suffrage Movement\r\nin Michigan,” by Karolena M. Fox; “Coming of the Italians to Detroit,”\r\nby Rev. John C. Visman; “Father Marquette at Michilimackinac,” by\r\nEdwin O. Wood; “Congregationalism as a Factor in the Making of\r\nMichigan,” by Rev. John P. Sanderson; “Historical Sketch of the\r\nUniversity of Detroit,” by Pres. William T. Doran; and “The Factional\r\nCharacter of Early Michigan Politics,” by Floyd B. Streeter.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nA worthy example of collecting and compiling history while it is in\r\nthe making is the work that is now being done by Floyd C. Shoemaker,\r\neditor of the _Missouri Historical Review_. Two stimulating articles\r\nhave recently appeared in the _Review_, one in September, 1917, the\r\nother in January, 1918, entitled “Missouri and the War.” The part\r\nplayed by the citizens of that commonwealth, the contributions made by\r\nthe state both in men and in resources, the recognition for\r\ndistinguished services won by Missouri men in the service, are being\r\ncarefully collected up to the very latest report. Before filing these\r\nrecords away in the archives for the use of students of a later\r\ngeneration, the editor is utilizing them to give the readers of the\r\n_Review_ a survey of the current activities of their state in the war.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska State Historical Society began publication in February of\r\na monthly news sheet entitled _Nebraska History and Record of Pioneer\r\nDays_. The editor states his aim to be to make the new publication “a\r\npiece of popular literature--as distinguished from academic.” A\r\npractical newspaper worker of long years’ experience, he should easily\r\nsucceed in this endeavor. Judging from the indications afforded by the\r\nfirst issue, a thing really new under the sun has at last been\r\nproduced--a history journal which is similar both in typography and in\r\ncontent to the ordinary newspaper. From another point of view the new\r\njournal may be described as a somewhat glorified press bulletin,\r\nbelonging to a type with which, in humbler guise, the world has long\r\nbeen familiar.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe second number of the _Louisiana Historical Quarterly_, bearing the\r\ndate September 14, 1917, was distributed in March. Since the first\r\nnumber was issued January 8, 1917, the _Quarterly_ is hardly living up\r\nto the promise implied in its title. This is a matter for genuine\r\nregret, since Louisiana constitutes one of the richest fields of\r\nhistorical exploitation in America, one well worthy of vigorous\r\ncultivation at the hands of the local historical society. Aside from a\r\nbrief paper on Lafayette’s visit to New Orleans, the issue of the\r\n_Quarterly_ now at hand is devoted to two interesting items: the first\r\nis a valuable bibliography of the principal works published on\r\nLouisiana and Florida from their discovery until 1855, prepared by A.\r\nL. Boimare, and hitherto unpublished; the second, is a filial and\r\nsomewhat passionate attempt at rehabilitating the reputation of\r\nGeneral James Wilkinson, made by his great-grandson, of the same name.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania has launched a new\r\nquarterly publication entitled The _Western Pennsylvania Historical\r\nMagazine_, volume I, number 1, appearing in January, 1918. The initial\r\nnumber contains the following articles: “Rev. John Taylor, The First\r\nRector of Trinity Episcopal Church of Pittsburgh and His Commonplace\r\nBook,” by Charles W. Dahlinger; “The Boatman’s Horn” (a poem), by\r\nGeneral William O. Butler; “The Trial of Mamachteaga, a Delaware\r\nIndian, The First Person Convicted of Murder West of the Alleghany\r\nMountains, and Hanged for His Crime,” by Judge Hugh Henry\r\nBrackenridge; “Diary of a Young Oil Speculator”; and an account of the\r\neleventh annual meeting of the Ohio Valley Historical Association. One\r\nsection of the magazine is devoted to notes and queries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIDER FIELD\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of the Minnesota Historical Society was held in the\r\nnew Historical building at St. Paul, January 14, 1918. The address was\r\ndelivered by Lester B. Shippee of the University of Minnesota on the\r\nsubject, “Social and Economic Effects of the Civil War with Special\r\nReference to Minnesota.”\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe annual spring meeting of the Mississippi Valley Historical\r\nAssociation is scheduled to be held at St. Paul this year; the formal\r\ndedication of the Minnesota Historical Society’s building taking place\r\nat this time.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOn April 9, in the Jefferson Memorial Library, St. Louis, was unveiled\r\na bronze Roll of Fame tablet in honor of the pioneers of Missouri from\r\n1793 to 1826. There are 112 names on the tablet, among them those of\r\nMajor Nathan Heald and Rebekah Heald, his wife. Major Heald was\r\ncommander at Fort Dearborn from 1810 until its destruction by the\r\nsavages in 1812. Most of Major Heald’s existing papers are preserved\r\nin the Wisconsin Historical Library.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMr. R. C. Ballard Thruston of Louisville has secured possession of the\r\nmanuscript report of the Illinois country made by George Rogers Clark\r\nto Governor Mason of Virginia in 1779. The document contains\r\nseventy-four pages 6½ by 8¼ inches, amounting to some 18,000 words.\r\nMr. Thruston intends that it shall eventually go either to the Filson\r\nClub or to some other Kentucky historical organization. Although\r\nalready twice put in print, it is a source of gratification to the\r\nhistorical fraternity of the Middle West to know that this interesting\r\nmanuscript is to be permanently preserved and made accessible to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nA laudable undertaking having for its ultimate object the improvement\r\nof our relations with Mexico has been instituted through the\r\ngenerosity of Edward Doheny, of Los Angeles. He has given a fund for\r\nthe study of social and industrial conditions in Mexico, in order that\r\nthe American public may be given impartial and authoritative\r\ninformation about these matters instead of having to depend, as has\r\nbeen largely the case hitherto, on partisan or ill-informed reports.\r\nTwelve students have been at work on the study since October, 1917,\r\nhaving been engaged for the period of one year. The results of this\r\nwork will be published in a series of reports. Members of the State\r\nHistorical Society and Wisconsin people, generally, will be interested\r\nto know that Chester Lloyd Jones of Madison, a life member of the\r\nSociety, is one of the scholars engaged in this important task of\r\nconstructive research. Headquarters for the work have been established\r\nat the Bancroft Library, University of California, where Mr. Jones is\r\nspending the year in the capacity of research associate of the\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Catholic Historical Society has recently been organized,\r\nwith headquarters in the Ashland Block, Chicago. William J. Onahan is\r\npresident of the Society and Joseph J. Thompson editor-in-chief. From\r\nthe preliminary announcement, which comes to us just as we go to\r\npress, the new society appears to have the backing of the more\r\nimportant churchmen of Chicago and Illinois. A magazine, the _Illinois\r\nCatholic Historical Review_, is to be issued.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAs we go to press the program is received for a centennial meeting of\r\nthe Illinois State Historical Society at Springfield, April 17 and 18.\r\nAddresses by Prof. Allen Johnson, of Yale, Elbert J. Benton, of\r\nWestern Reserve, C. W. Alvord, of the University of Illinois, Charles\r\nW. Moores, of Indianapolis, Hon. Louis Aubert, member of the French\r\nHigh Commission, and Pres. John H. Finley, of the University of New\r\nYork, are scheduled.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nFrancis A. Sampson, secretary of the Missouri Historical Society from\r\n1901 to 1915 and bibliographer from 1915 on, died at Columbia,\r\nMissouri, February 4, 1918. From 1906 until 1915 Mr. Sampson was\r\neditor of the _Missouri Historical Review_. He was an inveterate\r\ncollector of materials pertaining to Missouri history, and was largely\r\nresponsible for the upbuilding of the society’s library of 60,000\r\ntitles.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe death of Father Arthur E. Jones, archivist of the Jesuit College\r\nof St. Mary, took place at Montreal, on January 19. Father Jones was\r\none of the foremost authorities in America on the work of the early\r\nJesuit missionaries and explorers. To the unrivaled opportunities\r\nafforded him for utilizing all the source material in the possession\r\nof his order he united a great energy and zeal in carrying his\r\nresearches to the very scene of Jesuit labors, one of his many\r\nactivities being the location around the Georgian Bay of the mission\r\nstations which were destroyed in the Iroquois onslaughts, so well\r\ndescribed by Parkman. The researches that were carried on in this\r\nregard were fully described in the fifth annual report of the Bureau\r\nof Archives of Ontario, published in 1909.\r\n\r\nThe archives of St. Mary’s College, Montreal, of which Father Jones\r\nwas custodian, comprise one of the most valuable collections of\r\nmaterial on early Canadian and mid-west material in the Dominion.\r\nMarquette’s journal is there; so are the wonderfully minute linguistic\r\nwritings of Father Potier, five large volumes dealing with the Huron\r\nlanguage, now completely dead. When it is remembered that the Jesuits\r\nhave been in America three centuries and that they are noted for the\r\ncare they take of their records, some idea can be gained of the\r\nimportance of the collection in St. Mary’s College.\r\n\r\nIn his later years Father Jones had given special attention to making\r\nhis record of Jesuit service at the various missions as complete as\r\npossible. He had also done considerable work on the Potier writings\r\nwhich, but for the outbreak of the Great War, would probably have been\r\nreproduced in photo-facsimile ere now by the Ontario Archives\r\nDepartment. The project is only held up until such time as world\r\naffairs are less disturbed.\r\n\r\nThough a portion of his life was spent in parochial work, the chief\r\nwork of Father Jones was along educational lines. He is the author or\r\neditor of a number of valuable publications in his chosen field of\r\ninvestigation. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and a\r\ncorresponding member of several of the leading historical societies of\r\nthe United States, including our own State Historical Society. He was\r\na fine type of that mentality which the training of his order so often\r\nproduces; a delightful friend and acquaintance and a thorough\r\ninvestigator.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe Wyoming Historical and Geological Society of Pennsylvania\r\ncelebrated the sixtieth anniversary of its founding on April 12, 1918,\r\ncommemorating at the same time the one hundred tenth anniversary of\r\nthe burning of anthracite coal successfully in an open grate of\r\nWilkes-Barre. Christopher Wren was elected corresponding secretary of\r\nthe society, succeeding the late Rev. Horace E. Hayden.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe leading article in the March number of the _Mississippi Valley\r\nHistorical Review_ is on “President Lincoln and the Illinois Radical\r\nRepublicans,” by Arthur C. Cole. It sets forth in interesting fashion\r\nthe dissatisfaction felt by the radical wing of the Republican party\r\nin the early part of Lincoln’s administration with his conservative\r\nand temporizing policy. L. H. Gipson gives a clear account of the\r\ninternal dissensions and other factors responsible for “The Collapse\r\nof the Confederacy”; Homer Hockett, formerly of Wisconsin, discusses\r\n“The Influence of the West on the Rise and Fall of Political Parties”;\r\nand Theodore Blegen, of Milwaukee, a member of the State Historical\r\nSociety of Wisconsin, tells of “A Plan for the Union of British North\r\nAmerica and the United States, 1866.” Professor Alvord, whose\r\nresignation as managing editor of the _Review_ was announced in our\r\nMarch number, has consented to continue in charge until the close of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             STATEMENT\r\n\r\n  of THE WISCONSIN MAGAZINE OF HISTORY published quarterly at\r\n  Menasha, Wis., required by the Act of August 24, 1912.\r\n\r\n      NAME OF--                              POSTOFFICE ADDRESS\r\n  Editor, Milo M.
