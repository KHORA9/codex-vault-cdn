It is a test to which the\r\npurely linguistic teacher must obviously defer: while the master, who\r\naims at imparting knowledge of the subject-matter must acknowledge, if\r\nhis boys flounder helplessly in unprepared extracts, that they could\r\nhave learnt about ancient life better through translations.\r\n\r\nIn, addition to the value of unseen translation, as a test of teaching\r\nit constitutes an admirable thinking exercise. But so numerous are the\r\nvarious books of extracts already published that I should have seen\r\nnothing to be gained from the appearance of a new one like the present\r\nvolume were it not, as far as I know, different in two important\r\nrespects from others. It contains six Demonstrations of _how_ sentences\r\nare to be attacked: and further, the passages are chosen so that if a\r\nboy works through the book he can hardly fail to gain some outline\r\nknowledge of Roman Republican history.\r\n\r\nAs to the Demonstrations, their value will be evident if it is realised\r\nthat failure in this sort of translation means failure to analyse: to\r\nsplit up, separate, distinguish the component parts of an apparently\r\njumbled but really ordered sentence. A beginner must learn to trust the\r\nsolvent with which we supply him; and the way to induce him to trust it\r\nis to show it to him at work. That is what a Demonstration will do if\r\nonly the learner will give it a fair chance.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the historical teaching contained in the extracts, there\r\ncan be little doubt that the present tendency of classical teaching is\r\ntowards emphasising the subject-matter as well as the language. It is\r\nfelt that as training in political principles the reading of Greek and\r\nRoman authors offers unique advantages, such as many English boys can\r\nappreciate, who are deaf to the literary appeal. The choice therefore of\r\nhistorical extracts in chronological order is an attempt to recognise\r\nboth the two great aims of classical teaching at once. At any rate there\r\nis no reason to suppose that the linguistic exercise is in any way\r\nimpaired by being combined with a little history.\r\n\r\nI should like to direct attention also to the notes given on the\r\nextracts, and the purpose they are meant to serve. If no notes had\r\nbeen given some of the passages which are important or interesting\r\nhistorically would have been found too difficult for the boys for whom\r\nthey are intended. Moreover, most of the notes concern the historical\r\naspect of the extract to which they belong, and are part of the scheme\r\nby which the subject-matter of the passage is emphasised. Although the\r\npassages themselves are not strictly graduated, the help given in\r\ntranslation becomes less and less as the boy goes through the book; and\r\nit is obvious that those extracts which illustrate the later periods of\r\nRoman History will be found more difficult than the legends and stories\r\nwhich belong to an earlier age. In cases where no help at all is\r\ndesired, the Miscellaneous Passages (which are without notes) may be\r\nused.\r\n\r\n  E. LYTTELTON.\r\n\r\n  ETON: _April 1908_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the present book is to help boys to translate at sight. Of\r\nthe many books of unseen translation in general use few exhibit\r\ncontinuity of plan as regards the subject-matter, or give any help\r\nbeyond a short heading. The average boy, unequal to the task before him,\r\nis forced to draw largely upon his own invention, and the master, in\r\ncorrecting written unseens, has seldom leisure to do more than mark\r\nmistakes--a method of correction almost useless to the boy, unless\r\naccompanied by full and careful explanation when the written work is\r\ngiven back.\r\n\r\nNow that less time is available for Latin and Greek, new methods of\r\nteaching them must be adopted if they are to hold their own in our\r\npublic schools. When Lord Dufferin could say, 'I am quite determined, so\r\nfar as care and forethought can prevent it, that the ten best years of\r\nmy boy's life shall not be spent (as mine were) in nominally learning\r\ntwo dead languages without being able to translate an ordinary paragraph\r\nfrom either without the aid of a dictionary;' and Dr. Reid could write,\r\n'It is not too much to say that a large number of boys pass through our\r\nschools without ever dreaming that an ancient writer could pen three\r\nconsecutive sentences with a connected meaning: chaos is felt to be\r\nnatural to ancient literature: no search is made for sense, and the\r\nLatin or Greek book is looked upon as a more or less fortuitous\r\nconcourse of words;' when Dr. Rouse can assert, 'The public schoolboy at\r\nnineteen is unable to read a simple Latin or Greek book with ease, or to\r\nexpress a simple series of thoughts without atrocious blunders: he has\r\nlearnt from his classics neither accuracy nor love of beauty and\r\ntruth'--it is obvious that, for the average boy, the system of\r\nperfunctorily prepared set-books and dashed-off unseens is a failure.\r\nThe experience of every teacher who is also an examiner, and who has had\r\nto deal with public schoolboys, will confirm this; but during\r\ntwenty-five years' teaching and examining of boys in almost every stage,\r\nI have found that translation at sight, taught upon the plan of this\r\nbook, not only produces a good result, but teaches a boy how to grapple\r\nwith the bare text of a Latin author better than the habitual practice\r\nof translating at sight without any help at all. If the average boy is\r\nto be taught how to translate, his interest must be awakened and\r\nsustained, and the standard of routine work made as high as possible.\r\nThe clever boys are, as a rule, well provided for; but, even for them,\r\nthe methods of this book have been found to be the shortest road to\r\naccuracy and style in translation. Moreover by this means they have\r\ngained a firsthand acquaintance with Latin literature and the sources of\r\nRoman history.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible here to enter into 'the question of the close and\r\nstriking correspondence between the history, the literature, and the\r\nlanguage of Rome. It was not until the history of Rome threw its mantle\r\nover her poetry that the dignity of the poet was recognised and\r\nacknowledged. . . . In the same way the life of the Roman people is\r\nclosely bound up with the prose records, and the phenomena of the Roman\r\nEmpire lend a human interest to all representative Roman writers.'[1]\r\nConsiderations of this kind form a sufficient justification of the\r\nmethod here adopted of employing the historical records of Rome as a\r\nbasis of teaching.\r\n\r\nIn this book the Introduction (pp. 1-14) is written to teach a boy how\r\nto arrive at the meanings of words (_Helps to Vocabulary_, pp. 1-5); how\r\nto find out the thought of a sentence through analysis and a knowledge\r\nof the order of words in Latin (_Helps to-Translation_, pp. 5-12); how\r\nto reproduce in good English the exact meaning and characteristics of\r\nhis author (_Helps to Style_, pp. 13-14).\r\n\r\nIn the Demonstrations (pp. 15-58) the boy is taught to notice all\r\nallusions that give him a clue to the sense of the passage, to grapple\r\nwith the difficulties of construction, to break up sentences, and to\r\ndistinguish between the principal and the subordinate thoughts both in\r\nprose and verse.\r\n\r\nThe Passages have been carefully selected, and contain accounts of\r\nnearly all the important events and illustrious men of the period of\r\nhistory to which they belong. They are chronologically arranged and\r\ndivided into six periods, covering Roman history from B.C. 753 to B.C.\r\n44, leaving the Augustan and subsequent period to be dealt with in a\r\nsecond volume. The translation help given in the notes is carefully\r\ngraduated. The notes to Parts I., II., III. (marked D, pp. 60-107) are\r\nthus intended to help younger boys to deal with passages which would in\r\nsome cases be too difficult for them; less help in translation is given\r\nin Parts IV. and V. (marked C, pp. 108-159); while the notes to Part VI.\r\n(marked B, pp. 160-236) are mainly concerned with historical\r\nexplanation, illustration, or allusion.\r\n\r\nThe Miscellaneous Passages (pp. 238-271), chosen for me by my\r\nbrother-in-law, Mr. A. M. Goodhart (Assistant Master at Eton College),\r\nare added to provide occasional passages in which no help is given. It\r\nis hoped that these, which deal with subjects of general interest, and\r\ninclude a somewhat wide range of authors, may give variety to the book,\r\nand supply more verse passages than the historical character of the rest\r\nwould admit. For the sake of variety, or to economise time, some of the\r\npassages may be translated _viva voce_ at the discretion of the master.\r\n\r\nThe Appendices (pp. 274-363) may be referred to when a boy finds himself\r\nin doubt about the value of a Conjunction (I.), the force of a Prefix\r\n(II.), the meaning of a Suffix (III.), the Life and Times of his Author\r\n(VI.), or the historical significance of a date (VII.). In Appendix V.\r\na Demonstration is given to show how a boy, after sufficient practice in\r\ntranslation by the help of analysis, may to some extent learn to think\r\nin Latin, and so to follow the Latin order in arriving at the thought.\r\n\r\nThe important question of what maps should accompany the book will be\r\nbest solved by providing each boy with a copy of Murray's Small\r\nClassical Atlas, edited by G. B. Grundy, which will be found to be\r\nadmirably adapted to the purpose. By the kindness of Mr. John Murray,\r\ntwo plans (Dyrrachium and Pharsalus), not at present included in the\r\nAtlas, have been specially drawn to illustrate passages on pp. 216 and\r\n218, and are placed opposite the text.\r\n\r\nAs far as possible I have acknowledged my indebtedness to the Editors\r\nwhose editions of the classics have been consulted. For the historical\r\nexplanations I am under special obligation to the histories of Ihne and\r\nMommsen, to the 'Life of Cicero' by the Master of Balliol, and to the\r\n'Life of Caesar' by Mr. Warde Fowler. I have also to thank Messrs.\r\nMacmillan for allowing me to quote from Dr. Potts' 'Aids to Latin\r\nProse,' and from Professor Postgate's _Sermo Latinus_. For the prose\r\npassages the best texts have been consulted, while for Livy,\r\nWeissenborn's text edited by Müller (1906) has been followed throughout.\r\nAs regards the verse passages, the text adopted is, wherever possible,\r\nthat of Professor Postgate's recension of the _Corpus Poetarum\r\nLatinorum_. For the Short Lives I have found useful 'The Student's\r\nCompanion to Latin Authors' (Middleton and Mills), but I owe much more\r\nto the works of Teuffel, Cruttwell, Sellar, Tyrrell, and Mackail.\r\n\r\nThe Head Master of Eton, besides expressing his approval of the book,\r\nhas kindly offered to write an Introductory Note. He has also given me\r\nan exceptional opportunity of testing more than half the historical\r\npassages by allowing them to be used in proof, until the book was ready,\r\nfor the weekly unseen translation in the three blocks of fifth form,\r\nrepresented by the letters, B, C, D. The criticisms and suggestions made\r\nby Classical Masters at Eton, who have used the passages week by week,\r\nhave been very valuable, and, in particular, my thanks are due to Mr.\r\nImpey, Mr. Tatham, Mr. Macnaghten, Mr. Wells, and Mr. Ramsay. My thanks\r\nare also due to the Lower Master, Mr. F. H. Rawlins, for kindly reading\r\nthe MS. of the Introduction, Demonstrations, and Appendices I.-IV., and\r\nfor giving me the benefit of his wide experience.\r\n\r\nTo my brother-in-law, Mr. A. M. Goodhart, I owe it that I undertook to\r\nwrite the book; without his advice it would never have seen the light,\r\nand he has given me most valuable help and encouragement at every stage.\r\n\r\nAs regards the choice of type and style of printing, I owe a special\r\ndebt of thanks to Mr. W. Hacklett (manager of Messrs. Spottiswoode's\r\nEton branch), whose unceasing care and attention has been invaluable in\r\nseeing the book through the press. I must also acknowledge the patience\r\nand skill of Messrs. Spottiswoode's London staff in carrying out the\r\nmany alterations which I have found to be inseparable from the task of\r\nbringing each passage and its notes into the compass of a single page.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I should like to say that it has been my aim throughout to\r\nadhere to what is best in Roman literature, and to omit passages the\r\nchoice of which can only be justified by regarding their literary form\r\napart from their moral value. Latin literature contains so much that is\r\nat once excellent in style and noble in thought that it seems a grave\r\nmistake to exalt the one at the expense of the other.\r\n\r\n_Maxima debetur puero reverentia._\r\n\r\n  EDMUND LUCE.\r\n\r\n  WINDSOR: _April 1908_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: The late Professor Goodhart.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n  Introductory Note                                                  v\r\n  Editor's Preface                                                 vii\r\n  List Of Passages For Translation                                  xv\r\n  Index Of Authors                                               xxiii\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTION.

Heading.+--The selections in this book are in most cases\r\nintelligible apart from their context. In cases where this is not so,\r\nyou will find it a valuable exercise to endeavour to arrive at the\r\ncontext for yourself. In all cases, however, you should pay attention to\r\nthe +Heading+, which will give you a useful clue to the meaning of the\r\npassage,\r\n\r\n+2. Author.+--When you see the author's name, try to remember what you\r\nknow about him. For example, +Livy+, the historian of Rome and friend of\r\nAugustus, the contemporary of Vergil and Ovid. The short Lives, pp.\r\n293-345, will tell you the chief facts about the authors from whom the\r\nselections are taken, and will give you a brief summary of their chief\r\nworks. Also, if you refer to Appendix VII., pp. 347-363, you will gain\r\nsome idea of the time in which the authors lived and of their\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\n+3. Read the Passage through, carefully.+--As you read--\r\n\r\n(1) Notice all +allusions+ and +key-words+ that may help you to the\r\nsense of the passage.\r\n\r\n(2) +Pay special attention to the opening sentence.+ In translating a\r\npassage much depends on getting the first sentence right.\r\n\r\n(3) Notice especially the connectives which introduce sentences and\r\nclauses +marked off by commas+. In this way you will be able to\r\ndistinguish between a +Principal Sentence+ and a +Subordinate Clause+.\r\n\r\n(For List of Conjunctions see Appendix I. pp. 274-276.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHELPS TO VOCABULARY.\r\n\r\n+4. Through English Derivatives.+--English derivatives, if used in the\r\nproper way, may give you valuable help in inferring meanings. The reason\r\nwhy you must generally +not+ translate the Latin word by the derived\r\nEnglish word is that, as you probably know, many English derivatives\r\nhave come from Latin words which had wholly or in part lost their\r\nearlier classical meaning, or from Latin words not found at all in\r\nclassical Latin. Yet in such cases the English word may be far from\r\nuseless. You must take care to let it suggest to you the original or\r\nroot-meaning, leaving the correct meaning of the Latin, whether the same\r\nas the English word or not, to be determined by the context.\r\n\r\nFor example, +sê-cûr-us+ does not mean _secure_, but (like _secure_ in\r\nShakespeare and Milton) _care-less_.\r\n\r\n  'This happy night the Frenchmen are _secure_,\r\n  Having all day caroused and banqueted.'\r\n\r\n        SHAKESPEARE, _Hen. VI._ Part 1. II. i. 11.\r\n\r\n+In-crêd-ib-il-is+, on the other hand, often cannot be better translated\r\nthan by _incredible_, and +im-plâcâ-bilis+ by _implacable_.\r\n\r\nNotice, too, how often in the case of verbs the +supine stem+ will\r\nsuggest to you the meaning of the Latin through some English derivative,\r\nwhich the present stem conceals.\r\n\r\nFor example:--\r\n\r\n  +pingo+  +pictum+  _picture_  suggests _to paint_.\r\n  +caveo+  +cautum+  _caution_     \"      \" _beware_.\r\n  +colo+   +cultum+  _culture_     \"      \" _till_.\r\n  +fallo+  +falsum+  _false_       \"      \" _deceive_.\r\n\r\n+5. Through French Derivatives.+--Sometimes, when you cannot think of an\r\nEnglish derivative, a French word that you know will help you to the\r\nmeaning of the Latin.\r\n\r\nFor example:--\r\n\r\n   _L._      _F._\r\n  +pontem+  +pont+   suggests _bridge_.\r\n  +gustum+  +goût+      \"     _taste_.\r\n  +prâtum+  +pré+       \"     _meadow_.\r\n  +tâlem+   +tel+       \"     _such_.\r\n  +b[)i]b[)e]re+  +boire+     \"     _to drink_.\r\n\r\nBut, in order to make French derivatives a real help to you, you must\r\nknow something of the origin of the French language and of the chief\r\nrules that govern the pronunciation (and therefore the spelling) of\r\nFrench. Without going too much into detail, it may help you to remember\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n(1) +French+ has taken many words from +colloquial Latin+, which in the\r\ndays of Cicero was very different from classical Latin.\r\n\r\nFor example:--\r\n\r\n  _Literary Latin._  _Popular Latin._  _French._\r\n\r\n  +equus+            +caballus+        +cheval+    _horse_.\r\n  +pugna+            +batalia+         +bataille+  _battle_.\r\n  +os+               +bucca+           +bouche+    _mouth_.\r\n\r\n(2) +Unaccented+ syllables are usually dropped.\r\n\r\nFor example:--\r\n\r\n  +cérv-um+    +cerf+   _stag_.\r\n  +bonitátem+  +bonté+  _goodness_.\r\n\r\n(3) The general tendency of French is towards smoothness and\r\ncontraction.\r\n\r\nFor example:--\r\n\r\n   _L._        _F._\r\n  +bestiam+   +bête+   _beast_.\r\n  +fact-um+   +fait+   _deed_.\r\n  +spiss-um+  +épais+  _thick_.\r\n  +coll-um+   +cou+    _neck_.\r\n\r\nIn fact, bearing in mind the caution given you, it is an excellent rule\r\nto try to think out the meaning of the Latin by the help of English and\r\nFrench derivatives.\r\n\r\n+6. Compound Words.+--When you come to a word which you cannot\r\ntranslate, and in regard to which English and French derivatives do not\r\nhelp you, +break up the word+, if a compound, into its simple elements\r\nof +Prefix+, +Stem+, +Suffix+. Then from the meaning of its root or stem\r\nand from the force of the prefix and suffix, and by the help of the\r\ncontext, try to arrive at an English word to suit the sense.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to do this you should have some knowledge of--\r\n\r\n(1) A few simple rules for the +vowel changes of verbs in composition+.\r\nThus:\r\n\r\n+a+ before two consonants (except +ng+) often changes to +e+.\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ s{a}cr-o, con-s{e}cr-o; d{a}mn-o, con-d{e}mn-o.\r\n\r\n+a+ before one consonant and before +ng+ often changes to +i+.\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ f{a}c-io, ef-f{i}c-io; c{[)a]}d-o, ac-c{i}d-o;\r\n  t{a}ng-o, con-t{i}ng-o.\r\n  But gr{[)a]}d-ior, ag-gr{[)e]}d-ior.\r\n\r\n+a+ before +l+ and another consonant changes to +u+.\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ s{a}lt-are, in-s{u}lt-are.\r\n\r\n+[)e]+ changes to +[)i]+ (but not +e+ before two consonants) and +ae+\r\nto +i+.\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ t{e}n-ere, ob-t{i}n-ere; qu{ae}r-ere, in-qu{i}r-ere.\r\n\r\n+au+ changes to +u+.\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ cl{au}d-ere, in-cl{u}d-ere.\r\n\r\n(2) +Prefixes:+--To help you to detach the prefix more readily, notice\r\nthese simple euphonic changes, all of which result in making the\r\npronunciation smoother and easier. Thus:--\r\n\r\n(i.) +The last consonant of a Latin prefix is often made the same as, or\r\nsimilar to, the first consonant of the stem.+\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ {ad}-fero = affero; {ob}-pono = {op}-pono;\r\n  {com}(={cum})-tendo = {con}-tendo.\r\n\r\n(ii.) +The final consonant of a prefix is often dropped before two\r\nconsonants.+\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ {ad}-scendo = {a}-scendo.\r\n\r\nNotice also that the prepositional prefixes to verbs express different\r\nideas in different combinations.\r\n\r\nThus, sometimes the prefix has a somewhat +literal prepositional+ force.\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ {per}-currere = to run +through+.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes an +intensive+ force.\r\n\r\n  _E.g._ {per}-terrere = to +thoroughly+ frighten.\r\n\r\nIn all such cases you must be partly guided by the context.\r\n\r\n(For List of Important Prefixes, see Appendix II. pp. 277--281.)\r\n\r\n(3) +Suffixes+ (other than grammatical inflexions).\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the most important suffixes will often help you to the\r\ncorrect meaning of a Latin word, the root of which is familiar to you.\r\n\r\nThus from the [Rt]ag = _drive, move_, we have--\r\n\r\n  by addition of +-tor+ (= _agent or doer_ of an action),\r\n    +actor+ = _a doer_, _agent_.\r\n   \"    \"     \"  +-men+ (= _acts or results of acts_),\r\n    +agmen+ = _a course_, _line of march_, &c.\r\n   \"    \"     \"  +-ilis+ (= _belonging to, able to_),\r\n    +agilis+ = _easily moved_, _agile_.\r\n   \"    \"     \"  +-ito+ (= _forcible or repeated action_),\r\n    +agito+ = _put in action_, _agitate_.\r\n\r\n(For List of Important Suffixes, see Appendix III. pp. 282--286.)\r\n\r\n(4) +Cognates+, that is, words +related in meaning+ through a common\r\nroot. You will find it very useful to make for yourself lists of cognate\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nThus from the [Rt]+gna, gno+ = _know_, we have--\r\n\r\n  +gna-rus+ = _knowing_.\r\n  +i-gnarus+ (= +in + gnarus+) = _ignorant_.\r\n  +nos-co+ (= +gno-sco+) = _to get a knowledge of_.\r\n  +i-gno-sco+ = _not to know_, _pardon_.\r\n  +no-bilis+ (= +gno-bilis+) = _that can be known_, _famous_, _noble_.\r\n  +no-men+ (= +gno-men+) = _a name_.\r\n\r\nTo group together in this manner words of common origin and words\r\nclosely associated in meaning is one of the best ways in which you can\r\nincrease your vocabulary.\r\n\r\n(For additional Examples of Cognates, see Appendix IV. pp. 287-8.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHELPS TO TRANSLATION.\r\n\r\nYou have now read the passage through carefully, and thought out the\r\nvocabulary to the best of your ability. Begin then to translate the\r\nopening sentence, and pay great attention to these\r\n\r\n+7. General Rules.+--(1) Underline the +Principal Verb+, +Subject+ (if\r\nexpressed), and +Object+ (if any).\r\n\r\n(2) If the sentence contains +only one finite verb+, all you have to do\r\nis to group round Subject, or Verb, or Object the words and phrases that\r\nbelong to each of the three.\r\n\r\n(3) Translate the sentence literally. Do this mentally, without writing\r\nit down.\r\n\r\n(4) Then write down the best translation you can.\r\n\r\nFor example:--\r\n\r\n  +At GERMANI celeriter, consuetudine sua phalange facta, IMPETUS\r\n  gladiorum EXCEPERUNT.+\r\n\r\n  _But the Germans quickly formed into a phalanx, as was their custom,\r\n  and received the attacks of the swords_ (i.e. of the Romans with\r\n  drawn swords).\r\n\r\n(5) If the sentence contains one or more subordinate clauses, +consider\r\neach subordinate clause as if it were bracketed off separately+, and\r\nthen deal with each clause as if it were a principal sentence, finding\r\nout its Subject, Verb, Object, and adding to each its enlargements. Then\r\nreturn to the sentence as a whole, and group round its Subject,\r\nPredicate, and Object the various subordinate clauses which belong to\r\neach.\r\n\r\n+8. Help through Analysis.+--Very often analysis will help you to find\r\nout the +proper relation of the subordinate clauses+ to the three parts\r\nof the Principal Sentence. You need not always analyse on paper, but do\r\nit +always in your mind+. You will find an example of a simple method of\r\nanalysis at the close of Demonstrations I and IV, pp. 23, 47.\r\n\r\nWhen analysing, notice carefully that:--\r\n\r\n(1) An enlargement of a Noun may be\r\n\r\n  (a) An adjective                  +TERTIAM aciem.+\r\n  (b) A noun in apposition          +Publius Crassus ADULESCENS.+\r\n  (c) A dependent genitive          +impetus GLADIORUM.+\r\n  (d) A participle or participial   +nostris LABORANTIBUS.+\r\n          phrase\r\n  (e) An adjectival clause          +Publius Crassus QUI EQUITATUI\r\n                                        PRAEERAT.+\r\n\r\n(2) An enlargement of a Verb may be\r\n\r\n  (a) An adverb                     +CELERITER exceperunt.+\r\n  (b) A prepositional phrase        +EX CONSUETUDINE SUA exceperunt.+\r\n  (c) An ablative absolute          +PHALANGE FACTA exceperunt.+\r\n  (d) An adverbial clause           +ID CUM ANIMADVERTISSET,\r\n                                        Publius Crassus misit.+\r\n\r\n+9. Help through Punctuation.+--Though only the full-stop was used by\r\nthe ancients, the punctuation marks which are now used in all printed\r\ntexts should be carefully noticed, especially in translating long and\r\ninvolved sentences.\r\n\r\nThus in Demonstrations III and IV notice how the subordinate clauses are\r\nfor the most part enclosed in commas.\r\n\r\n+10. Help through Scansion and Metre.+--A knowledge of this is\r\nindispensable in translating verse. To scan the lines will help you to\r\ndetermine the grammatical force of a word, and a knowledge of metre will\r\nenable you to grasp the poet's meaning as conveyed by the position which\r\nhe assigns to the various words, and the varying emphasis which results\r\nfrom variation of metre. For example:--\r\n\r\n(1) _A grammatical help._--You know that final +-a+ is _short_ in nom.\r\nand voc. sing. 1st Decl., and in neut. plural, and is _long_ in abl.\r\nsing. 1st Decl. and 2nd Imperat. 1st Conj.\r\n\r\nThus in Demonstration II (p. 24) you can easily determine the\r\ngrammatical form of finals in +-a+.\r\n\r\nIn Sentence IV +agn[)a]+, in VI +cerv[)a]+, in VIII +iunct[)a]\r\ncolumb[)a]+, in IX +Cynthi[)a]+ are all short and nom. sing.\r\n\r\nIn Sentence V +umbrâ unâ+ are long and abl. sing. in agreement.\r\n\r\n(2) _A help to the poet's meaning._--The more you know of the principles\r\nof scansion, the better able you will be to understand and appreciate\r\nthe skill with which a great poet varies his metre and chooses his\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n+11. Help through a Study of the Period in Latin.+--One great difference\r\nbetween English and Latin Prose is that, while modern English is to a\r\ngreat extent a language of short, detached sentences, Latin +expresses\r\nthe sense by the passage as a whole+, and holds the climax in suspense\r\nuntil the delivery of the last word. 'This mode of expression is called\r\na +PERIOD+ (a +circu[)i]tus+ or +amb[)i]tus verborum+), because the\r\nreader, in order to collect together the words of the Principal\r\nSentence, must make a _circuit_, so to say, round the inserted\r\nclauses,'[2] 'Latin possesses what English does not, a mode of\r\nexpression by means of which, +round one main idea are grouped all its\r\naccessory ideas+, and there is thus formed a single harmonious whole,\r\ncalled the +PERIOD+.'[3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Potts, _Hints_, p. 82.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Postgate, _Sermo Latinus_, p. 45.]\r\n\r\nA +PERIOD+ then is a sentence containing only one main idea (the\r\nPrincipal Sentence) and several Subordinate Clauses. The Periodic style\r\nis generally used for History and Description, and is best seen in\r\nCicero and Livy.\r\n\r\nThe following is a good example of the PERIOD in Latin:--\r\n\r\n  [4]+VOLSCI exiguam spem in armis, alia undique abscissa, cum\r\n  tentassent, praeter cetera adversa loco quoque iniquo ad pugnam\r\n  congressi, iniquiore ad fugam, cum ab omni parte caederentur,\r\n  ad preces a certamine versi, dedito imperatore traditisque armis,\r\n  sub iugum missi, cum singulis vestimentis ignominiae cladisque pleni\r\n  DIMITTUNTUR.+\r\n\r\n    _The +VOLSCIANS+ found that now they were severed from every\r\n    other hope, there was but little in prolonging the conflict.\r\n    In addition to other disadvantages they had engaged on a spot\r\n    ill-adapted for fighting and worse for flight. Cut to pieces\r\n    on every side they abandoned the contest and cried for quarter.\r\n    After surrendering their commander and delivering up their arms,\r\n    they passed under the yoke, and with one garment each +WERE SENT+\r\n    to their homes covered with disgrace and defeat._\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: Potts, _Hints_, p. 85.]\r\n\r\nNotice here that\r\n\r\n(1) There is only one main idea, that of _the ignominious return of the\r\nVolscians to their homes_.\r\n\r\n(2) The rest describes the attendant circumstances of the surrender and\r\nof the causes that led to it.\r\n\r\n(3) In English we should translate by at least four separate sentences.\r\n\r\n(4) The Latin contains only forty-eight words, while the English\r\ncontains eighty-one.\r\n\r\nProfessor Postgate ('Sermo Latinus,' p. 45) gives the following example\r\nof the way in which a Latin +PERIOD+ may be built up:--\r\n\r\n  +BALBUS vir optimus, dux clârissimus et multis mihi beneficiis carus,\r\n  rogitantibus Arvernis ut populi Romani mâiestâtem ostentâret\r\n  suîque simul imperi monumentum eis relinqueret, MÛRUM laterîcium,\r\n  vîginti pedes lâtum, sexâginta altitûdine et ita in immensum\r\n  porrectum ut vix tuis ipse oculis crêderes tantum esse, nêdum aliis\r\n  persuâderes, non sine adverso suo rûmore ut qui principâtum\r\n  adfectaret AEDIFICAVIT.+\r\n\r\n    _+BALBUS+, an excellent man and most distinguished commander,\r\n    who had endeared himself to me by numerous kindnesses,\r\n    was requested by the Arverni to make a display of the power\r\n    and greatness of Rome, and at the same time to leave behind him\r\n    a memorial of his own government. He accordingly +BUILT+ a +WALL+\r\n    of bricks, twenty feet wide, sixty high, and extending to such\r\n    a prodigious length that you could hardly trust your own eyes\r\n    that it was so large, still less induce others to believe it.\r\n    But he did not escape the malign rumour that he had designs\r\n    upon the imperial crown._\r\n\r\nHere, as in the previous example,\r\n\r\n(1) There is only one main idea,\r\n\r\n  +BALBUS MURUM AEDIFICAVIT+.\r\n\r\n(2) The rest consists of--\r\n\r\n  (a) Enlargements of +BALBUS+--+vir optimus ... carus+;\r\n  placed, therefore, directly _after_ +BALBUS+.\r\n\r\n  (b) Enlargements of +MURUM+--+laterîcium ... persuaderes+;\r\n  placed, therefore, directly _after_ +MURUM+.\r\n\r\n  (c) Enlargements of +AEDIFICAVIT+\r\n\r\n  +rogitantibus ... relinqueret+ = the _cause_ of the building of\r\n  the wall.\r\n\r\n  +(murum) non sine ... adfectaret+ = the _attendant circumstances_\r\n  of the building of the wall; placed, therefore, _before_\r\n  +AEDIFICAVIT+.\r\n\r\n(3) In English we must translate by at least three separate sentences,\r\nand, where necessary, translate participles as finite verbs, and change\r\ndependent clauses into independent sentences.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said: 'An English sentence does not often exhibit the\r\nstructure of the Period. It was imitated, sometimes with great skill and\r\nbeauty, by many of the earlier writers of English prose; but its effect\r\nis better seen in poetry, as in the following passage:--\r\n\r\n  \"High on a throne of royal state, which far\r\n  Outshone the wealth of Ormuz and of Ind,\r\n  Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand\r\n  Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,\r\n  Satan exalted sat.\"'\r\n\r\n        MILTON, _Paradise Lost_, ii. 1-5.\r\n\r\n+12. Help through a Knowledge of the Order of Words in Latin.+--If you\r\nstudy the examples already given of the Period you will see that the\r\n+Order of Words in English+ differs very much from the +Order of Words\r\nin Latin+.\r\n\r\nDr. Abbott writes as follows: 'The main difference between English and\r\nLatin is that in English the _meaning_ depends mainly on the _order_ of\r\nwords, and the _emphasis_ mainly on the _voice_, while in Latin the\r\n_meaning_ depends almost entirely on the _inflexions_, and the\r\n_emphasis_ upon the _order_.'\r\n\r\nThus, if we take the English sentence, _Caesar conquered the Gauls_, we\r\ncannot invert the order of _Caesar_ and _Gauls_ without entirely\r\nchanging the meaning. In Latin, however, we may write (since each Latin\r\nword has its own proper inflexion, serving almost as a label)\r\n\r\n+Caesar vicit Gallos+: +Gallos Caesar vicit+: +Caesar Gallos vicit+,\r\nwithout any change of meaning except that of shifting the emphasis from\r\none word to another.\r\n\r\nThe usual order of words in a Latin Prose Sentence may be said to be\r\n\r\n(1) Particles, or phrases of connection (with some exceptions, _e.g._\r\n+vero+, +autem+, +quidem+, +enim+, which stand second).\r\n\r\n(2) Subject.\r\n\r\n(3) Words, phrases, clauses, as enlargements of Subject.\r\n\r\n(4) Adverbial enlargements of Predicate (though an Ablative Absolute\r\nmust generally stand first).\r\n\r\n(5) Indirect Object (if any) and its enlargements.\r\n\r\n(6) Direct Object (if any) and its enlargements.\r\n\r\n(7) The Principal Verb.\r\n\r\nTo take a simple example:--\r\n\r\n  [5]+LIVIUS, imperator fortissimus, quamquam adventus hostium\r\n  non ubi oportuit nuntiatus est, PERICULUM illa sua in rebus dubiis\r\n  audacia facile EVASIT.+\r\n\r\n    _+LIVIUS+, a most excellent commander, although the enemy's\r\n    arrival was not reported when it should have been, easily\r\n    +ESCAPED+ the +DANGER+ by his well-known daring in perilous\r\n    positions._\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: Postgate, _Sermo Latinus_, p. 38.]\r\n\r\nTo take another example:--\r\n\r\n  [6]+Archimedis EGO quaestor ignoratum ab Syracusanis, cum esse\r\n  omnino negarent, saeptum undique et vestitum vepribus et dumetis,\r\n  INDAGAVI SEPULCRUM.+\r\n\r\n    _When I was Quaestor, +I WAS ABLE TO TRACE OUT+ the +TOMB+ of\r\n    Archimedes, overgrown and hedged in with brambles and brushwood.\r\n    The Syracusans knew nothing of it, and denied its existence._\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: Demonstration VI. Sent. 1. p. 55.]\r\n\r\nNotice here the following special points of order:--\r\n\r\n(1) The two most important positions in the sentence are the beginning\r\nand the end.\r\n\r\n(2) Special emphasis is expressed by placing a word in an unusual or\r\nprominent position.\r\n\r\nE.g. here, the unusual position of +Archimedis+ and +sepulcrum+.\r\n\r\n(3) In the middle of the sentence the arrangement is such that the words\r\nmost closely connected in meaning stand nearest together.\r\n\r\nE.g. here, +ignoratum ... dumetis+ is all logically connected with the\r\nobject +sepulcrum+, which for the sake of emphasis is put in an unusual\r\nposition at the end of the sentence.\r\n\r\n+13. Additional Hints.+--(1) Remember that Latin is often +concrete+\r\nwhere English is +abstract+.\r\n\r\nE.g.--\r\n\r\n  +ingeniosi+ (men of genius) = _genius_.\r\n  +eruditi+ } (learned men) = _learning_.\r\n  +docti+   }\r\n  +viri summo ingenio praediti, saepe invidia opprimuntur.+\r\n    _The most exalted genius is frequently overborne by envy._\r\n  +omnes immemorem benefici oderunt.+\r\n    _The world regards ingratitude with hatred._\r\n\r\n(2) The same Latin word may stand for different English words. Take, for\r\nexample, the various uses of the word +RES+ in the following passage of\r\nLivy, xlv. 19:--\r\n\r\n  [7]+Ut RES docuit . . . animo gestienti REBUS secundis . . .\r\n  speculator RERUM quae a fratre agerentur . . . REM prope prolapsam\r\n  restituit . . . aliis alia regna crevisse REBUS dicendo.+\r\n\r\n    _As the +FACT+ showed . . . spirits running riot from +PROSPERITY+\r\n    . . . to watch the +COURSE+ pursued by his brother . . . he restored\r\n    what was almost a lost +CAUSE+ . . . by saying that kingdoms grow\r\n    by various +MEANS+._\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: Postgate, _Sermo Latinus_, p. 34.]\r\n\r\nIn translating +RES+, +avoid at all costs+ the word +THING+, or\r\n+THINGS+, and let the context guide you to the appropriate English word.\r\n\r\n(3) You may often translate a +Latin Active by an English Passive+.\r\nLatin prefers the Active because it is more direct and vivid.\r\n\r\nFor example:--\r\n\r\n  +Liberas aedes coniurati sumpserunt.+\r\n    _An empty house had been occupied by the conspirators._\r\n\r\n(4) Use great care in translating Latin +Participles+, and make clear in\r\nyour translation the relation of the participial enlargements to the\r\naction of the main Verb.\r\n\r\nFor example:--\r\n\r\n  concessive: +Romani, non ROGATI, auxilium offerunt.+\r\n              _The Romans, +though they were not asked+, offer help._\r\n\r\n       final: +Fortuna superbos interdum RUITURA levat.+\r\n                _Fortune sometimes raises the proud, only +to dash\r\n                them down+._\r\n\r\n      causal: +S. Ahala Sp. Maelium regnum APPETENTEM interemit.+\r\n                _S. Ahala killed Sp. Maelius +for aiming at+ the royal\r\n                power._\r\n\r\nNotice also:--\r\n\r\n  +Pontem captum incendit+\r\n    _He took and burned the bridge._\r\n  +Nescio quem prope adstantem interrogavi.+\r\n    _I questioned someone who was standing by._\r\n  +Haec dixit moriens+\r\n    _He said this while dying._\r\n  +Nuntiata clades+\r\n    _The news of the disaster._\r\n\r\n(5) In translating, try to bring out the exact force of the +Ablative\r\nAbsolute+, by which a Latin writer shows the time or circumstances of\r\nthe action expressed by the Predicate. The Ablative Absolute is an\r\nadverbial enlargement of the Predicate, and is not grammatically\r\ndependent on any word in the sentence. It is, therefore, called\r\n+absolutus+ (i.e. _freed from_ or _unconnected_). It should very seldom\r\nbe translated literally. Your best plan will be to consider carefully\r\nwhat the Ablative Absolute seems to suggest about the action of the\r\nPrincipal Verb.\r\n\r\nFor example:--\r\n\r\n  +Capta Troia, Graeci domum redierunt.+\r\n    _The Greeks returned home after the capture of Troy._\r\n\r\n  +Regnante Romulo, Roma urbs erat parva.+\r\n    _When Romulus was reigning, Rome was a small city._\r\n\r\n  +Exercitu collecto in hostes contenderunt.+\r\n    _They collected an army and marched against the enemy._\r\n\r\n  +Nondum hieme confecta in fines Nerviorum contendit.+\r\n    _Though the winter was not yet over, he hastened to the territory\r\n    of the Nervii._\r\n\r\n  +Tum salutato hostium duce, ad suos conversus, subditis equo\r\n  calcaribus, Germanorum ordines praetervectus est, neque expectatis\r\n  legatis, nec respondente ullo.+\r\n    _Thereupon, after saluting the enemy's general, he turned to his\r\n    companions, and setting spurs to his horse, rode past the ranks\r\n    of the Germans, without either waiting for his staff, or receiving\r\n    an answer from anyone._\r\n\r\n\r\nHELPS TO STYLE.\r\n\r\nThough Style cannot perhaps be taught, it can certainly be formed and\r\nimproved. There are several ways of improving your Style. For example:--\r\n\r\n+14. Through the Best English Literature.+--+Read good Literature+, the\r\nbest English Authors in prose and verse. You will know something,\r\nperhaps, of Shakespeare and Scott, of Macaulay and Tennyson. Though you\r\nmay not be able to attack the complete works of any great author, you\r\nought not to have any difficulty in finding good books of selections\r\nfrom the English Classics.\r\n\r\n+15. Through good Translations.+--Study a few +good English Versions+ of\r\npassages from the best Latin writers. You may often have a good version\r\nof the passage you translate read to you in your Division after your\r\nmistakes have been pointed out to you, and to this you should pay great\r\nattention. You will thus learn eventually to suit your style to the\r\nAuthor you are translating, while at the same time you render the\r\npassage closely and accurately.\r\n\r\n+16. Be Clear.+--Remember that the first characteristic of a good style\r\nis +clearness+--that is, to say what you mean and to mean what you say.\r\nQuintilian, the great critic, says that the aim of the translator should\r\nbe, not that the reader may understand if he will, but that he _must_\r\nunderstand whether he will or not. The more you read the greatest\r\nAuthors the more you will see that, as Coleridge says, 'there is a\r\nreason assignable not only for every word, but for the position of every\r\nword.'\r\n\r\n+17. Be Simple.+--With clearness goes simplicity--that is, use no word\r\nyou do not understand, +avoid fine epithets+, and do not choose a phrase\r\nfor its sound alone, but for its sense.\r\n\r\n+18. Avoid Paraphrase.+--You are asked to translate, not to give a mere\r\ngeneral idea of the sense. What you have to do is to +think out the\r\nexact meaning+ of every word in the sentence, and to express this in as\r\ngood and correct English as you can.\r\n\r\n+19. Pay attention to Metaphors.+--The subject of Metaphor is of great\r\nimportance in good translation. You will find that every language\r\npossesses its own special Metaphors in addition to those which are\r\ncommon to most European languages. As you become familiar with Latin\r\nAuthors you must try to +distinguish the Metaphors common+ to English\r\nand Latin and those +belonging only+ to English or to Latin.\r\n\r\nFor example:--\r\n\r\n(1) Metaphors +identical+ in Latin and English--\r\n\r\n  +Progreditur res publica naturali quodam itinere et cursu.+\r\n    _The State advances in a natural path and progress._\r\n\r\n(2) Metaphors +differing+ in Latin and English--\r\n\r\n  +cedant arma togae+\r\n    _let the sword yield to the pen._\r\n  +ardet acerrime coniuratio+\r\n    _the conspiracy is at its height._\r\n  +rex factus est+\r\n    _he ascended the throne._\r\n  +conticuit+\r\n    _he held his peace._\r\n\r\n+20. Careful Translation a Help to Style.+--In conclusion. Nothing will\r\nhelp your style more than to +do your translations as well as you\r\npossibly can+, and to +avoid repeating the same mistakes+. The Latins\r\nthemselves knew the value of translation as a help to style.\r\n\r\nFor example, Pliny the Younger says:--\r\n\r\n'As useful as anything is the practice of translating either your Greek\r\ninto Latin or your Latin into Greek. By practising this you will acquire\r\npropriety and dignity of expression, an abundant choice of the beauties\r\nof style, power in description, and gain in the imitation of the best\r\nmodels a facility of creating such models for yourself. Besides, what\r\nmay escape you when you read, cannot escape you when you translate.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMONSTRATIONS\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\nUNSEEN TRANSLATION\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nThe use of a personal mode of address in the following Demonstrations\r\nis explained by the fact that they are written primarily for the use\r\nof boys. It is hoped, however, that they may be found useful to masters\r\nalso, and that the fulness with which each passage is treated may supply\r\nsome helpful suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMONSTRATION I.\r\n\r\n  _Fierce encounter with the Germans._\r\n\r\n(a) Reiectis pilis cominus gladiis pugnatum est. |II| At Germani\r\nceleriter, ex consuetudine sua, phalange facta, impetus gladiorum\r\nexceperunt. |III| Reperti sunt complures nostri milites, qui in\r\nphalangas insilirent, et scuta manibus revellerent, et desuper\r\nvulnerarent. |IV| Cum hostium acies a sinistro cornu pulsa atque in\r\nfugam conversa esset, a dextro cornu vehementer multitudine suorum\r\nnostram aciem premebant. |V| Id cum animadvertisset Publius Crassus\r\nadulescens, qui equitatui praeerat, quod expeditior erat quam hi qui\r\ninter aciem versabantur, tertiam aciem laborantibus nostris subsidio\r\nmisit. |VI| Ita proelium restitutum est. ||\r\n\r\n       CAESAR.\r\n\r\n_Fierce encounter with the Germans._\r\n\r\n(b) Reiectis pilis cominus gladiis +pugnatum est+. {II} At +Germani+\r\nceleriter, ex consuetudine sua, phalange facta, +impetus+ gladiorum\r\n+exceperunt+. {III} +Reperti sunt+ complures nostri +milites+ [_qui\r\nin phalangas insilirent, et scuta manibus revellerent, et desuper\r\nvulnerarent_.] {IV} [_Cum hostium acies a sinistro cornu pulsa atque\r\nin IV fugam conversa esset,_] a dextro cornu vehementer multitudine\r\nsuorum nostram +aciem premebant+. {V} [_Id cum animadvertisset\r\n+Publius Crassus+ adulescens,_] [_qui equitatui praeerat,_]\r\n[_quod expeditior erat quam hi qui inter aciem versabantur,_]\r\ntertiam +aciem+ laborantibus nostris subsidio +misit+. {VI} Ita\r\nproelium +restitutum est+.\r\n\r\n        CAESAR.\r\n\r\nDEMONSTRATION I.\r\n\r\n  CAESAR, _B. G._ i. 52. _Reiectis pilis ... restitutum est._\r\n\r\n_Heading and Author._--This tells you enough for working purposes, even\r\nif you do not remember the outline facts of Caesar's campaign against\r\nAriovistus, the chief of the Germans, called in by the Gauls in their\r\ndomestic quarrels, who conquered and ruled them until he was himself\r\ncrushed by the Romans.\r\n\r\n_Read through the passage carefully._--As you do this, notice all\r\nallusions and key-words that help you to the sense of the passage,\r\n_e.g._ +Germani+, +nostri milites+, +Publius Crassus+. The general sense\r\nof the passage should now be so plain (_i.e._ an incident in a battle\r\nbetween the Germans and the Romans) that you may begin to translate\r\nsentence by sentence.\r\n\r\n+I.+ +Reiectis pilis cominus gladiis pugnatum est.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+Reiectis+ = +re + iacio+ = _throw back_ or _away_. The context will\r\ntell you which is the better meaning for +re-+. Notice the force of all\r\nprefixes in composition, whether separate or inseparable as here. For\r\n+re-+, see pp. 280, 281.  [[Appendix II.II: Separable Particles]]\r\n\r\n+pilis+ = the +pîlum+, the distinctively _Roman_ missile weapon.\r\n\r\n+cominus+ = +comminus+: _i.e._ +con (= cum) + manus+ = _hand to hand._\r\nN.B.--In composition _a_ often becomes _i_, cf. +iacio+, +re-icio+; and\r\ncf. +e-minus+ = _at a distance_.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--\r\n\r\n+PUGNATUM EST+. The only finite verb in the sentence, and the principal\r\none. The form shows you it is a so-called impersonal verb, and therefore\r\nthe subject must be sought from the verb itself in connection with the\r\ncontext. Here, clearly, you must translate _the battle was fought_.\r\n\r\n+cominus+ tells us _how_, i.e. _hand to hand_.\r\n\r\n+reiectis pilis+. You will recognise this as an _ablative absolute_\r\nphrase. But do not translate this literally _their javelins having been\r\nthrown away_, for this is not English. Let the principal verb and the\r\nsense generally guide you to the force of the phrase. Thus you can see\r\nhere that the Roman soldiers had no use for their javelins, and so threw\r\nthem away as a useless encumbrance. (The context tells us that the Roman\r\nsoldiers had no time to hurl their javelins against the foe.) You can\r\nnow translate the whole sentence--_(and so) the Romans threw away their\r\njavelins and fought hand to hand with swords_.\r\n\r\n+II.+ +At Germani celeriter, ex consuetudine sua, phalange facta,\r\nimpetus gladiorum exceperunt.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+ex consuetudine sua + = _according to their custom_. You will probably\r\nhave met with +consuetudo+, or +consuesco+, or +suesco+. Our own word\r\n_custom_ comes from it through the French _coutume_. For this use of\r\n+ex+ cf. +ex sententia+, +ex voluntate+.\r\n\r\n+phalange+ = _phalanx_. If you learn Greek, you will readily think of\r\nthe famous Macedonian phalanx.\r\n\r\n+impetus+ = _attacks_ = +in + peto+ (= _aim at_). Cf. our _impetus_,\r\n_impetuous_.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--This sentence contains only one finite verb, the\r\nprincipal one.\r\n\r\n+EXCEPERUNT+ = _(they) received_. _Who_ received? Clearly\r\n\r\n+GERMANI+ = _the Germans_. Received _what_?\r\n\r\n+IMPETUS+ = _the attacks_. +impetûs+ must be Acc. Plur.\r\n\r\nAll you now have to do is to assign to their proper places the words and\r\nphrases that remain. Of these\r\n\r\n  1. +celeriter+           }\r\n  2. +ex consuetudine sua+ }\r\n  3. +phalange facta+      }\r\n        modify the action of +exceperunt+, telling us _when_ and _how_\r\n        they received, and\r\n  4. +gladiorum+\r\n        belongs to +impetûs+.\r\n\r\nNow translate the whole sentence. _But the Germans quickly formed into a\r\nphalanx, as was their custom, and received the attacks of the swords_\r\n(i.e. _of the Romans with drawn swords_).\r\n\r\n+III.+ +Reperti sunt complures nostri milites, qui in phalangas\r\ninsilirent, et scuta manibus revellerent, et desuper vulnerarent.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+insilirent+ = +in + salio+ = _leap-on_. And cf. our _insult_. Notice\r\nthe usual phonetic change of vowel from _a_ to _i_. (English derivatives\r\nwill often help you to the meaning of a Latin word, though, for reasons\r\nthat are explained to you in the Introduction, pp. 1, 2, § 4, you must\r\nlet them lead you up to the _root-meaning_ of the Latin word rather than\r\nto an exact translation.)\r\n\r\n+revellerent+ = +re + vello+ = _pluck-away_. If you forget the meaning\r\nof +vello+, the supine +vulsum+ through some English derivative--e.g.\r\n_re-vulsion_, _con-vulsion_--will probably help you to the root-meaning.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--This sentence contains four finite verbs. As you\r\nread it through, underline the principal verb, clearly +REPERTI SUNT+,\r\nand bracket +qui+ to +vulnerarent+. You cannot doubt which verbs to\r\ninclude in your bracket, for +qui+, which is a subordinate conjunction\r\nas well as a relative pronoun, serves as a sure signpost. Also\r\n+revellerent+ and +vulnerarent+ are joined by +et--et+ to +insilirent+,\r\nso your bracket includes all from +qui+ to +vulnerarent+. The commas in\r\nthe passage will often help you to the beginning and end of a\r\nsubordinate clause. Now begin with the principal verb +REPERTI SUNT+ and\r\nits subject +complures nostri MILITES+, _many of our soldiers were\r\nfound_.\r\n\r\n+qui ... vulnerarent+. This subordinate clause describes, just as an\r\nadjective does, _the character_ of these +complures nostri+, so that\r\n+qui = tales ut+--i.e. _brave enough to leap upon the phalanxes, and\r\npluck away the shields (of the Germans) and wound them from above_.\r\n\r\n+IV.+ +Cum hostium acies a sinistro cornu pulsa atque in fugam conversa\r\nesset, a dextro cornu vehementer multitudine suorum nostram aciem\r\npremebant.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+[)a]cies+ = _line of battle_.\r\n\r\n[Rt]+ac+ = _sharp_ (cf. +âcer+), perhaps thought of as the _edge_ of a\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n+cornu+ = _horn_; so, figuratively, _the wing of an army_.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--This sentence contains three finite verbs.\r\nUnderline +PREMEBANT+, clearly the principal verb, and bracket +cum+ to\r\n+conversa esset+. Here the signpost is the subordinate conjunction\r\n+cum+. Next find the subject of +premebant+: obviously no word from +a\r\ndextro+ to +aciem+ can be the subject; it is implied in\r\n+premebant+--i.e. _they_, which as context shows = +Germani+. Now find\r\nthe object = +nostram aciem+ = _our line_.\r\n\r\nThus you have as the backbone of the whole sentence:--\r\n\r\n  _They (the Germans) were pressing our line._\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the sentence will now take its proper place, as in some\r\nway modifying the action of +premebant+.\r\n\r\nThus:--\r\n\r\n  +cum ... conversa esset+ tells us _when_       they were pressing.\r\n  +a dextro cornu+          \"    \"  _where_          \"        \"\r\n  +vehementer+              \"    \"  _how_            \"        \"\r\n  +multitudine suorum+      \"    \"  _how or why_     \"        \"\r\n\r\nN.B.--+suorum+, reflexive, must be identical with the subject of\r\n+premebant+.\r\n\r\n  Now translate _{Though}{When} the enemy's line had been routed\r\n  and put to flight on their left wing, on their right wing, owing to\r\n  their great numbers, they were pressing hard upon our line._\r\n\r\n+V.+ +Id cum animadvertisset Publius Crassus adulescens, qui equitatui\r\npraeerat, quod expeditior erat quam hi qui inter aciem versabantur,\r\ntertiam aciem laborantibus nostris subsidio misit.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+animadvertisset+ = +animum + ad + verto+ = _to turn the mind to, to\r\nobserve_.\r\n\r\n+adulescens+ = here like our _junior_, to distinguish him from his\r\nfather, Marcus Crassus the triumvir.\r\n\r\n+expeditior+ = _more free_ (+ex + pes+ = _foot-free_; so +impeditus+ =\r\n_hampered_, _hindered_).\r\n\r\n+versabantur+--(+verso+ frequent. of +verto+) = _turn this way and\r\nthat_; so +verso-r+ dep. = _turn oneself_, _engage in_, _be_, according\r\nto the context.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--This sentence is more involved, 'periodic'[8] in\r\nstyle. You will see on p. 23 how much help can be given by a more\r\ndetailed analysis. [[Demonstration I: Table]]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: See Introduction, pp. 7-9, § 11.]\r\n    [[Introduction 11. Help through a Study of the Period in Latin.]]\r\n\r\nNow, as before, bracket the subordinate clauses thus:--\r\n\r\n  +1.+ +Id ... adulescens+\r\n  +2.+ +qui ... praeerat+\r\n  +3.+ +quod ... versabantur+\r\n\r\nand then the only principal verb is +MISIT+. Underline this. Next\r\nunderline the principal subject, clearly +P. CRASSUS+, which is also the\r\nsubject of clause 1. Then, _outside the brackets_, the only possible\r\nobject is +ACIEM+: underline this.\r\n\r\nNow analyse, as on p. 23. [[Demonstration I: Table]]\r\n\r\n(a) Write down +CRASSUS+, +MISIT+, +ACIEM+.\r\n\r\n(b) Place alongside these their proper enlargements.\r\n\r\n(c) If necessary, analyse separately all subordinate clauses--_e.g._ A1,\r\nA2, A3 in example on p. 23.\r\n\r\nYou should now be able to translate without any difficulty; only take\r\ncare to arrange the enlargements so as to make the best sense and the\r\nbest English. Thus: _When Publius Crassus the younger, who was in\r\ncommand of the cavalry, had observed this, he sent the third line to the\r\nhelp of our men who were hard pressed, as he was more free to act than\r\nthose who were engaged in action._\r\n\r\n+VI.+ +Ita proelium restitutum est.+ _In this way the battle was\r\nrestored._\r\n\r\n  _Final Hints._\r\n\r\nRemember that +one passage mastered+ is worth a great many hurriedly\r\ntranslated. So before you leave this passage notice carefully in the\r\n\r\nI. _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n(i.) Any words that are quite new to you. Look them out in the\r\ndictionary, and notice their derivation and use; if you do not do this\r\nyou will find the same word new to you the next time you meet with it.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _English Derivatives._--As you have seen, these will often help\r\nyou to the root-meaning of a word. Thus:--\r\n\r\n  +reiectis+ = _reject, throw away_\r\n  +insilirent+ = _insult, jump on_\r\n\r\nand in the case of verbs, as these two examples show, derivatives are\r\nmost easily found from the _supine_ stem.\r\n\r\nN.B.--This must be done very carefully, because many such English\r\nderivatives have come from Latin words after they had wholly, or in\r\npart, lost their classical meaning, or from Latin words not found at all\r\nin classical Latin.\r\n\r\nA great many other English words are derived from the Latin of this\r\npassage--e.g. _pugnacious_, (with) _celerity_, _fact_, _except_,\r\n_military_, _manual_, _super_-sede, _vulnerable_, _hostile_, _sinister_,\r\nuni-_corn_, and many others.\r\n\r\n(iii.) _Prefixes._--Notice especially the force of prepositions and\r\ninseparable particles in composition, e.g.:--\r\n\r\n  +re-+ in +re-iectis+, +re-vellerent+, +restitutum+.\r\n  +in-+ in +impetus+, +insilirent+.\r\n  +ex-+ in +exceperunt+, +expeditior+.\r\n\r\n(iv.) _Simple Phonetic Changes in Composition_, e.g.:--\r\n\r\n+a+ to +i+ in +insilirent+, +cominus+ (+con + manus+).\r\n\r\n(v.) _Groups of Related Words._\r\n\r\nThus +acies+ [Rt]+ac+ = _sharp_, is related to +[)a]c-er+, sharp;\r\n+[)a]c-ervus+, a heap; +[)a]c-utus+, sharp, &c.\r\n\r\n+expeditior+ [Rt]+ped+ = _tread, go_, is related to +pes+, a foot;\r\n+impedio+ = entangle; +impedimentum+ = hindrance, etc.\r\n\r\nII. _Historical and other Allusions._--\r\n\r\n(i.) Read a summary of Caesar's campaign against Ariovistus.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Terms relating to War._--Thus notice:--\r\n\r\n+pilum+, the distinctively _Roman_ infantry weapon, and see a good\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n_phalanx_; cf. the Roman +testudo+.\r\n\r\n+tertiam aciem+--_i.e._ the line of reserves, kept for just such\r\nemergencies. Read, if necessary, some short account of the +triplex\r\nacies+, the usual Roman order of battle.\r\n\r\nIII. _Some Authorities._--\r\n\r\n(i.) _Caesar_, Allen and Greenough, published by Ginn & Co.

Thus the first line (which you can\r\nno doubt translate at once) tells of the fame of Arion, and the\r\nsucceeding lines describe the charm of his music.\r\n\r\n_The Form of the Passage: Elegiac Verse._--Scan[9] as you read, and mark\r\nthe quantity in the verse of all finals in +-a+. You will see the value\r\nof this, as you translate.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: See Introduction, pp. 6, 7, § 10.]\r\n    [[Introduction 10. Help through Scansion and Metre]]\r\n\r\nYou can now begin to translate, taking one complete sentence at a time.\r\n\r\n+I.+ +Quod mare non nôvit, quae nescit [)A]rî[)o]n[)a] tellûs?+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--You will know all the words here, but observe\r\n+nôvit+ = _knows_, not _knew_, for +nôvi+ means _I have become\r\nacquainted with, I have learned_, and [therefore] _I know_; and notice\r\nalso the important cognates from the [Rt]#gno-#, #gnô-#, +-gna+, +-gno+,\r\n#gi-gnô-skô# = _I learn to know_, cf. our _know_, _ken_, _can_,\r\n_con_--#no-os# (_mind_), +-gna-rus+ = _know-ing_; +no-sco+\r\n(= +gno-sco+).\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--This sentence contains no subordinates; the two\r\nfinite verbs, +nôvit+, +nescit+, are both principal.\r\n\r\nNext, the form of the sentence, with the question-mark at the end, shows\r\nthat +mare+ must be the subject of +nôvit+, and +tellus+ of +nescit+.\r\n(+[)A]rî[)o]n[)a]+ cannot be nominative, for the suffix +-a+ is the\r\nusual Greek 3rd decl. Acc. Sing., where Latin has +-em+.) Also +quod+\r\nand +quae+ are clearly interrogative and adjectival; so translate:--\r\n\r\n_What sea does not know, what land is ignorant of Arion?_\r\n\r\nN.B.--Try to render this line a little more poetically.\r\n\r\n+II.+ +Carmine currentes ille tenêbat aquâs.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--You will know all these simple words.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--Here again there are no subordinates. The\r\nprincipal verb is +tenebat+, the subject +ille+, and the object +aquas+;\r\nso translate:--\r\n\r\n_He used to stay the running waters by his song._\r\n\r\nN.B.--Notice force of Imperfect in +tenebat+.\r\n\r\n+III.+ +Saepe, sequens agnam, lupus est a voce retentus;+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--All you need notice here is the force of +re-+ in\r\n+retentus+ = _held back_, cf. our _re_-tain.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--Before you translate, notice Ovid's frequent use\r\nof _parataxis_, _i.e._ placing one thought side by side with another\r\nthought, _without any connective_, even although one thought is, in\r\nsense, clearly subordinate to another. This is one of the ways in which\r\nall great poets _heighten the effect_ of what they say, and many\r\nexamples of it are to be found in Ovid's best elegiac verse. As you look\r\nthrough this passage you will find:\r\n\r\n  (a) Lines 1, 2, 3, 4 each form a complete sentence.\r\n\r\n  (b) In the whole passage there is not _one_ subordinate conjunction.\r\n\r\n  (c) The only expressed connective is the simplest link-word +et+.\r\n\r\nThe principal verb is +retentus est+, the subject +lupus+. +Sequens\r\nagnam+ describes +lupus+, and +saepe+ and +a voce+ tell us _when_ and\r\n_why_ the wolf _was stayed_.\r\n\r\n_Often has the wolf in pursuit of the lamb been stayed at the sound._\r\n\r\n(For this use of +a+ or +ab+ to express _origin_ or _source_ cf. Ovid,\r\n_Fasti_, v. 655 [V. 709]: _Pectora traiectus Lynceo Castor_ +ab ense+.)\r\n\r\n+IV.+ +Saepe avidum f[)u]giens restitit agn[)a] lupum.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+Restitit+ = _stood still_; +re + si-st-o+, _i.e._ from [Rt]sta-,\r\nstrengthened by reduplication; cf. #hi-stê-mi#. Contrast carefully\r\nmeaning of +re-sto+, = _stand firm_ or _be left_.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--Again a very simple sentence. The principal verb\r\nis +restitit+, the subject +agn[)a]+; +fugiens avidum lupum+ enlarges\r\nthe subject +[)a]gna+, and +saepe+ tells us when the lamb _stood still_.\r\n\r\n_Often has the lamb, when fleeing from the hungry wolf, stood still\r\n(stopped short in its flight)._\r\n\r\nN.B.--Notice the _parallelism_ in this couplet, where the parallel lines\r\nexpress the same idea. This is a characteristic feature of Hebrew\r\npoetry, e.g.:\r\n\r\n  'Seek ye the Lord while He may be found:\r\n  Call ye upon Him while He is near.'\r\n\r\n        Is. lv. 6.\r\n\r\nand is frequently employed by Ovid.[10]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: E.g.:\r\n      Plena fuit vobis omni concordia vita,\r\n        Et stetit ad finem longa tenaxque fides.\r\n          _Amores_ ii. 6. 13-14.]\r\n\r\n+V.+ +Saepe c[)a]nes lep[)o]resque umbrâ c[)u]buêre sub unâ.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+Lep[)o]res+ = _hares_. As this is closely connected by +-que+ with\r\n+c[)a]nes+, you are not likely to confuse it with +l[)e]por+ (+lepos+;\r\ncf. #lampô#) = _a charm_, _grace_.\r\n\r\n+Cubuere+ = _lay down_. Cp. +-cumbo+ in composition, and our\r\n_recumbent_, _succumb_, and _cub_-icle.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--Another simple sentence about which there can be\r\nno doubt. The metre shows that +umbrâ+ must be taken with +sub unâ+:--\r\n\r\n_Often have the dogs and the hares reclined beneath the same shade._\r\n\r\n+VI.+ +Et stetit in saxo proxim[)a] cerv[)a] leae.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+Leae+ = _lioness_. +Lea+ (poetical form of +leaena+) suggests +leo+.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--The metre shows +proxim[)a]+ must be taken with\r\n+cerv[)a]+. But to translate _the nearest stag (hind)_ makes nonsense,\r\nand renders +leae+ untranslatable, while _the hind very close to the\r\nlioness_ makes good sense.\r\n\r\n_And the hind has stood still on the crag close beside the lioness._\r\n\r\n+VII.+ +Et s[)i]ne lîte l[)o]quax cum Palladis âlite cornix sêdit.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+Lîte+ = _strife_. To _litigate_ = contest in law (+lit + agere+) may\r\nhelp you to the root-meaning.\r\n\r\n+Loquax+ = _talkative_, clearly connected with +l[)o]q-uor+, and\r\n_loq_-uacious. +Alite+ = _a bird_, lit. _winged_; cf. +âl-a+, a _wing_.\r\n\r\n+Cornix+ = _a crow_, probably from [Rt]#kar#; cf. our _croak_, and\r\n#korax#, +cor-vus+, a _raven_.\r\n\r\n+Palladis.+ You have no doubt heard of #Pallas Athênê#, the virgin\r\ngoddess of war and of wisdom.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--The force of the illustration lies in the strong\r\ncontrast between the chattering, tale-bearing crow and the wise, silent\r\nowl sacred to the goddess of wisdom. Two such opposites, under the spell\r\nof Arion's music, forget to quarrel, though for the time in close\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n_And the chattering crow has without strife sat in company with the bird\r\nof Pallas._\r\n\r\n+VIII.+ +Et accipitri iunct[)a] c[)o]lumb[)a] fuit.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+Accipitri+ = _hawk_ (a general name for birds of prey), probably from\r\n[Rt]#pet-#, +pet-+ = _move quickly_; cf. #pet-omai# = _fly about_;\r\n+p[)e]t-o+ = _fall upon_, _attack_, _seek_.\r\n\r\nSo +accipiter+ = +ac + p[)e]t-+, _swift + flying_; cf. #ôkupteros# =\r\n_swift-winged_.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--The metre shows that +columb[)a]+ and +iunct[)a]+\r\nmust be taken together:--\r\n\r\n_And the dove has-been-joined-to (has consorted with) the hawk._\r\n\r\n+IX.+\r\n\r\n  +Cynthia saepe tuis fertur, vôcalis [)A]rîôn,\r\n    Tamquam fraternis obst[)u]puisse m[)o]dis.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+Cynthia+ = _Diana_ (_Artemis_), so called from Mt. Cynthus, in Delos,\r\nwhere she and Apollo were born.\r\n\r\n+Fertur+ = _is said_, _asserted_; cf. +f[)e]runt+ = _they say_.\r\n\r\n+Vôcalis+ = _tuneful_, clearly from same root as +vox+, +v[)o]c-o+,\r\n&c., of our _vocal_. For change of quantity cf. +rex+, +rêgis+, from\r\n+r[)e]go+.\r\n\r\n+Obst[)u]puisse+ = _to have been spell-bound_; +st[)u]p-eo+,\r\n+st[)u]p-idus+, and our _stupefy_, _stupid_ will suggest the\r\nroot-meaning.[11]\r\n\r\n+M[)o]dis+ = _measures_, especially of verse, or, as here, of music.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: Notice this word, which is often employed to express\r\n    the ideas of _entránce_, _enthrall_, _strike dumb_, _amaze_.]\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--You will remember that Apollo, the god who brings\r\nback light and sunshine in spring, is also the god of music and of\r\npoetry. Ovid skilfully implies that Arion's playing was so beautiful\r\nthat even Diana, Apollo's own sister, mistakes Arion's playing for her\r\nbrother's.\r\n\r\nThis sentence takes up a whole couplet, but is in form quite simple.\r\nThus +fertur+ is the incomplete predicate, and +obstupuisse saepe tuis\r\nmodis tamquam fraternis+ completes the predicate, _i.e._ tells us all\r\nthat is said of the subject +Cynthia+.\r\n\r\n+Vôcalis [)A]rîon+ is clearly vocative, or nominative of address.\r\n\r\n_O tuneful Arion, often is Cynthia said to have been spell-bound by thy\r\nstrains, as by those of her brother (Apollo)._\r\n\r\n_Final Suggestions._\r\n\r\nYou have now learnt how to translate this passage, but you must do more\r\nbefore you can master it. Thus in these simple but beautiful lines\r\nnotice:--\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--This is easy and familiar, but even if you know the\r\nmeaning of the words study their _cognates_--_i.e._ related words--as\r\npointed out to you in the vocabulary, _e.g._ under +nôvit+, p. 25,\r\nsentence I.  [[Demonstration II.ii]]\r\n\r\n(ii.) _English Derivatives._--Remember that often, where you cannot\r\nthink of an English derivative, some very familiar _French_ word will\r\nhelp you to the root-meaning of the Latin. Thus:--\r\n\r\n   Latin.     French.   English.\r\n  +Carmine+  _Charme_  _Charm_ (_Song_)\r\n  +Agnam+    _Agneau_  _Lamb_\r\n  +Lupus+    _Loup_    _Wolf_\r\n  +Cerva+    _Cerf_    _Stag_ (_Hind_)\r\n\r\nand notice that where the English word, e.g. _charm_, differs in\r\nspelling from the Latin, it is because it comes to us through a French\r\nchannel. Cf. _feat_ from Fr. _fait_ = L. _factum_.\r\n\r\n(iii.) _Allusions and Parallel Passages._--In verse these are often\r\nnumerous and important. Poetry is naturally full of imagery, and borrows\r\nfrom many sources. Thus, for ll. 1-8, compare Hor. _Od._ I. xii. 5:\r\n\r\n  'Aut in umbrosis Heliconis oris\r\n      .    .    .    .\r\n  Arte materna rapidos morantem\r\n  Fluminum lapsus  .  .  .'\r\n\r\nand Verg. _G._ iv. 510:\r\n\r\n  'Mulcentem tigris et agentem carmine quercus.'\r\n\r\nShakesp. _Hen. VIII._ III. i.:\r\n\r\n  'Orpheus with his lute made trees,\r\n  And the mountain-tops that freeze,\r\n    Bow themselves when he did sing';\r\n\r\nor read Tennyson's poem 'Amphion.'\r\n\r\n_Lines 5, 6._--Cf. Isaiah xi. 6: 'The wolf also shall dwell with the\r\nlamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the\r\nyoung lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n(iv.) _Hints for Verses._--Ovid is the acknowledged master of elegiac\r\nverse. Therefore, whenever you have a passage of his elegiacs to\r\ntranslate, you should, if possible, learn it by heart. (The Arion story\r\nas told by Ovid is well worth a place in any collection of _Ediscenda_.)\r\nIf you cannot do this, notice useful phrases and turns of expression,\r\ne.g.:--\r\n\r\n_Line 1._--A question, instead of a bare statement, where no answer is\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nCf. 'Quod crimen dicis praeter amasse meum?'\r\n\r\n  (Dido to Aeneas, Ov. _Her._ vii. 164.)\r\n\r\n_Lines 3, 4._--Parataxis and repetition of idea.\r\n\r\n_Line 9._--+Vocalis Arion+, apostrophe.\r\n\r\n_Line 2._--Simplicity; alliteration.\r\n\r\n(v.) _The Poem as Literature._--Ovid here depicts in language purposely\r\nexaggerated the power of music over the hearts of men, and even over\r\nnature, animate and inanimate. This gives point to the strong contrast\r\nin the lines which follow, where greed dominates all the feelings.\r\nShakespeare refers to the love of music as a test of character:--\r\n\r\n  'The man that hath no music in himself,\r\n  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,\r\n  Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.'\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMONSTRATION III.\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n_A rash promise rashly believed._\r\n\r\nHannibali alia in his locis bene gerendae rei fortuna oblata est. |I|\r\nM.

Make all the use you can of your previous knowledge of History,\r\nGeography, and Antiquities.\r\n\r\nThus, +Hannibali+ suggests an episode in the Second Punic War.\r\n\r\n  +M. Centenius+ is clearly the unfortunate subject of the episode.\r\n\r\n  +in Lucanos ... substiterat+ helps to fix the date as later than\r\n  +Cannae+, 216 B.C.\r\n\r\n(ii.) Observe carefully all phrases that will require special care in\r\ntranslating--_e.g._ +bene gerendae rei+--+inter primipili\r\ncenturiones+--+perfunctus militia+--+operae pretium+--+ad id locorum+.\r\n\r\nYou will now have a sufficient general idea of the form and general\r\nsense of the passage, and may begin to translate sentence by sentence.\r\n\r\n+I.+ +Hannibali alia in his locis bene gerendae rei fortuna oblata est.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+oblata+, cf. _ob-lation_ = _an offering_ and _of-fer_.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--\r\n\r\n+oblata est+ shows that the subject must be +fortuna+, with which +alia+\r\nmust agree, and +gerendae rei+ is dependent genitive. So you may at once\r\ntranslate literally _Another fortune (chance) of carrying-on the matter\r\nwell in these parts was offered to Hannibal_. But you must not be\r\nsatisfied with this, for though literally correct it is neither good\r\nHistory nor good English. So render: _In this district Hannibal had\r\nanother chance presented to him of achieving a success_.\r\n\r\nHere notice especially the use of the word +res+,[12] a remarkable\r\nexample of the tendency of Roman writers to employ the ordinary and\r\nsimple vocabulary wherever possible _instead of inventing a new word_.\r\nAs a writer well says, '+Res+ is, so to say, a blank cheque, to be\r\nfilled up from the context to the requisite amount of meaning.' Cf.\r\n'+Consilium erat quo fortuna rem daret, eo inclinare vires+,' where\r\n+res+ = _victory_.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Cf. Introduction, p. 11.]  [[Introduction 13 (2)]]\r\n\r\n+II.+ +M. Centenius fuit cognomine Paenula, insignis inter primipili\r\ncenturiones et magnitudine corporis et animo.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+primipili+ = the chief centurion of the +triarii+ (the third, veteran\r\nline of the legion), the +primipilus+, or +primus pilus+. So Livy vii.\r\n41, '+primus centurio erat, quem nunc (centurionem) primi pili\r\nappellant+.'\r\n\r\n+cognomine+, _i.e._ +co-nomen+, a name _added_ to the +nomen+, a title,\r\nepithet, _e.g._:\r\n\r\n  +Publius+ = the distinctive +praenomen+.\r\n  +Scipio+ = +nomen+, designating his +gens+.\r\n  +Africanus+ = +cognomen+.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--The form of this sentence is quite simple. The\r\nsubject is +M. Centenius+, with which +insignis+ agrees. _There was a\r\ncertain M. Centenius, by surname Penula, distinguished among the\r\nfirst-rank_ (or _chief_) _centurions_ (of the Triarii) _both for his\r\ngreat bodily size and courage._\r\n\r\n+III.+ +Is perfunctus militia, per P. Cornelium Sullam praetorem in\r\nsenatum introductus, petit a Patribus, uti sibi quinque milia militum\r\ndarentur.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+perfunctus+, cf. _function_, and notice force of +per+ = discharge\r\n_completely_.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--The principal verb is clearly +petit+, and +is+ is\r\nthe only possible subject (= +Centenius+), with which +introductus+\r\nagrees. There is one subordinate clause, introduced by +ut+, telling us\r\nthe object of his request.\r\n\r\nTranslate, first literally, _He having discharged completely his\r\nmilitary service, being introduced into the Senate by P. C. Sulla, the\r\nPraetor, asks the Fathers that 5000 soldiers should be given him_. Now\r\nimprove this: get rid at all costs of the _having_ and _being_, which\r\nare not English, and change the _asks_ into the past tense of narration.\r\nThus:--\r\n\r\n_After he had completed his term of service, and had been introduced to\r\nthe Senate by P. Corn. Sulla, the Praetor, he petitioned the Fathers\r\nthat 5000 soldiers should be given him._\r\n\r\n+IV.+ +Se peritum et hostis et regionum, brevi operae pretium facturum:\r\net, quibus artibus ad id locorum nostri et duces et exercitus capti\r\nforent, iis adversus inventorem usurum.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+peritum+, cf. _ex-peri-enced_. [Rt]+par-+, +per-+, _pierce_, _go\r\nthrough_; so, +ex-per-ior+, +per-iculum+, in sense of a _trial_.\r\n\r\n+operae pretium+ = lit. '_what will pay for the trouble_,' _i.e. worth\r\nwhile_, _i.e._ worth the _time_ (or _labour_) spent upon it.\r\n\r\n+artibus--ars.+ [Rt]+ar+ = _fit_, _join_ = skill in joining something,\r\nskill in producing; so, _artist_, _artisan_, _artifice_, etc.\r\n\r\n+ad id locorum+[13] = _to that point of time_. The ideas of _place_ and\r\n_time_ readily interchange; so, +in loco+ = at the right _place_ or\r\n_time_.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: Cf. Sallust, _Jugurtha_, 63 _Tamen is_ +ad id\r\n    locorum+ _talis vir_ = _Such was his character up to this time_.]\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--The form of the sentence shows that it is\r\n_reported speech_, and not the actual words of the speaker +Centenius+,\r\nwho is still the principal subject, and +dixit+, _understood_, the\r\nprincipal verb, and +se peritum ... usurum+ the object of +dixit+. You\r\nshould now be able to translate without any difficulty, and the logical\r\ncommon-sense rules for the conversion of Or. Recta into Or. Obliqua\r\nexplain the mood of the verb +capti forent+ in the subordinate clause\r\nintroduced by +quibus+.\r\n\r\nLiterally: _Centenius said that he, experienced in both the enemy and\r\nthe districts, would soon make it worth (their) while: and that he would\r\nuse against their inventor those arts by which up to that time both our\r\nleaders and our armies had been overcome._ Notice that the long relative\r\nclause +quibus artibus ... forent+ is in Latin placed before the\r\nantecedent +iis+.\r\n\r\nYou will readily see that this must be improved in several points.\r\nThus:--\r\n\r\n(a) +Use Oratio Recta+--more graphic and better suited to our idiom.\r\n\r\n(b) _arts_. Change this to some more suitable military term--e.g.\r\n_tactics_.\r\n\r\n_He was well acquainted (he said) both with the enemy and the country,\r\nand would shortly make it worth their while, and would employ against\r\ntheir originator those very tactics by which both our leaders and our\r\narmies had up to that time been baffled._\r\n\r\n+V.+ +Id non promissum magis stolide, quam stolide creditum: tamquam\r\neaedem militares et imperatoriae artes essent!+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+stolide+, cf. _stolid_ = dull, foolish.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--The finite copula +est+ is, as often, omitted; the\r\ntwo principal verbs are +promissum (est)+ and +creditum (est)+ linked by\r\nthe comparative particles +magis--quam+, and the subject is +id+;\r\n+tamquam--essent!+ is a subordinate clause modifying the two principal\r\nverbs, and expressing contemptuous wonder.\r\n\r\nCf. '+tamquam clausa sit Asia, sic nihil perfertur ad nos+.'\r\n\r\nYou can now translate\r\n\r\nLiterally: _That was promised not more foolishly than it was foolishly\r\nbelieved, just as if the arts of a soldier and of a general were the\r\nsame._\r\n\r\nHere you can make several improvements; avoid the repetition of\r\n_foolishly_, and use a better term than _arts_, and perhaps break up the\r\nsentence into two short ones. Thus:--\r\n\r\n_The folly of the promise was not greater than that of the credit it\r\nreceived. Just as though the qualities of a soldier and of a general\r\nwere the same!_\r\n\r\n+VI.+ +Data pro quinque octo milia militum; pars dimidia cives, pars\r\nsocii.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+dimidia+ [Rt]+med-+, +mid-+ = _middle_, so +dimidius+ = +dis + medius+.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--This sentence is very simple: notice that here,\r\ntoo, +sunt+ and +erant+ are omitted.\r\n\r\n_Eight thousand soldiers were given him instead of five: half were\r\ncitizens, half allies._\r\n\r\n+VII.+ +Et ipse aliquantum voluntariorum in itinere ex agris concivit,\r\nac prope duplicate exercitu, in Lucanos pervenit, ubi Hannibal,\r\nnequiquam secutus Claudium, substiterat.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+aliquantum+ = _considerable_, used in the neuter as a noun, with a\r\npartitive genitive +voluntariorum+. Cf. use of +satis+, +parum+, etc.\r\n\r\n+concivit+ = _raised_, lit. roused, stirred up. Cf. +ci-eo+, and our\r\n_ex-cite_, _in-cite_.\r\n\r\n+substiterat+ = _had halted_. +si-st-o+ is only a form of +sto+\r\nstrengthened by reduplication (cf. #histêmi#) with a causal force. Cf.\r\n+restitit+, p. 27, sentence iv.  [[Demonstration II:iv]]\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--The principal subject is clearly +ipse+; there are\r\ntwo principal verbs, +concivit+ and +pervenit+, coupled by +ac+, and one\r\nsubordinate clause, +ubi ... substiterat+, introduced by +ubi+, and\r\nmodifying +pervenit+.\r\n\r\nThe sense is so clear that you may translate at once into good\r\nEnglish:--\r\n\r\n_Moreover he himself raised a considerable number of volunteers in the\r\ncountry during his march; and so, with his numbers nearly doubled, he\r\nreached Lucania, where Hannibal, after his fruitless chase of Claudius,\r\nhad halted._\r\n\r\nThe following version was shown up by a boy of fifteen in a recent\r\nscholarship examination:\r\n\r\n'Hannibal in _carrying on his successful campaign met with some\r\ndifferent luck in this district_. Marcus Centenius, whose cognomen was\r\nPenula, was famous among the centurions of the first rank for his huge\r\nlimbs and great courage. This man, after having accomplished his years\r\nof military training, on being introduced into the Senate by the Prætor\r\nP. Cornelius Sulla, requested the Patricians to give him 5000 soldiers.\r\nHe said that he was well acquainted both with the enemy's tactics and\r\nthe district round about, and in a short time _would convert the\r\nengagement into a prize for the State_: moreover, he added, I will\r\nemploy the same tactics against the _enemy_ as those by which our\r\ngenerals and troops have been captured in these parts. This was\r\n_faithfully_ believed as it was _faithfully_ promised: the tactics of\r\nthe soldiers and of the commanders were so much alike! He received 8000\r\nmen instead of 5000: half of them were Roman citizens, half allies:\r\nmoreover he himself _got_ some volunteers while on the march in the\r\ncountry districts and so almost doubled his army: he thus reached the\r\nterritory of the Lucani, where Hannibal after a fruitless pursuit after\r\nClaudius, had taken up his position.'\r\n\r\nThis version is neither bad nor good. The style is, on the whole fair,\r\nknowledge of vocabulary very fair, and the rendering generally accurate.\r\nIt will, however, be of use to you as an object lesson: so notice\r\ncarefully the following points:--\r\n\r\nI. _Style._\r\n\r\n_Sentence IV._--\r\n\r\n(i.) The Oratio Obliqua of the original he renders partly as Reported\r\nSpeech and partly as Oratio Recta. This is, of course, to be avoided.\r\nContrast the rendering given under Sentence IV.\r\n\r\n_Sentence III._--\r\n\r\n(ii.) +Is perfunctus ... darentur.+ He uses too many participles.\r\nContrast version under Sentence III.\r\n\r\n_Sentences VI., VII._--\r\n\r\n(iii.) He translates +data pro quinque ... substiterat+ by one long\r\nsentence, instead of breaking it up into two at least.\r\n\r\nII. _Vocabulary._\r\n\r\n_Sentence IV._--\r\n\r\n+Se peritum ... usurum.+ He confuses +pretium+ with +praemium+, +operae+\r\nwith +rei publicae+ (?). He should have been familiar with the phrase\r\n+operae pretium+.\r\n\r\n+inventorem+ he renders by _enemy_; perhaps a careless mistake, as if\r\nthe word were +inimicum+ (which after all does not = +hostem+).\r\n\r\n_Sentence V._--\r\n\r\n+stolide+ he renders by _faithfully_. A moment's thought given to the\r\nEnglish word _stolid_ should have put him on the right track.\r\n\r\n_Sentence VII._--\r\n\r\n+concivit+ he renders by _got_, vague and inappropriate. He fails to\r\nbring out the root-meaning of +cieo+ = _to stir up_.\r\n\r\nIII. _Construction._\r\n\r\n_Sentence I._--\r\n\r\nThis is very bad. _Analysis_ would at once have shown him that the\r\nlogical order of the sentence was\r\n\r\n+Alia fortuna bene gerendae rei oblata est Hannibali in his locis+,\r\n\r\nthough he might not see that +in his locis+ must be closely connected\r\nwith +oblata est+.\r\n\r\n_Sentence IV._--\r\n\r\n+brevi operae pretium facturum.+ Very bad: due probably to not carefully\r\nweighing the meaning of each word.\r\n\r\nYou will now see that a strict attention to analysis and to the\r\nroot-meanings of words really familiar would have enabled this candidate\r\nto send up a good version.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMONSTRATION IV.\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n_Rashness justly punished._\r\n\r\nHaud dubia res est, quippe inter Hannibalem ducem et centurionem;\r\nexercitusque, alterum vincendo veteranum, alterum novum totum, magna ex\r\nparte etiam tumultuarium et semiermem. |I| Ut conspecta inter se agmina\r\nsunt, et neutra pars detrectavit pugnam, extemplo instructae acies. |II|\r\nPugnatum tamen, ut in nulla pari re, duas amplius horas, concitata et,\r\ndonec dux stetisset, Romana acie. |III| Postquam is non pro vetere fama\r\nsolum, sed etiam metu futuri dedecoris, si sua temeritate contractae\r\ncladi superesset, obiectans se hostium telis cecidit, fusa extemplo est\r\nRomana acies. |IV| Sed adeo ne fugae quidem iter patuit omnibus viis ab\r\nequite insessis, ut ex tanta multitudine vix mille evaserint, ceteri\r\npassim alii alia peste absumpti sint. |V|\r\n\r\n        LIVY.\r\n\r\n_Rashness justly punished._\r\n\r\n  [Transcriber's Note:\r\n  The braces around the \"Postquam...\" clause are in the original.]\r\n\r\n+Haud dubia res est+, [quippe inter Hannibalem ducem et centurionem;\r\nexercitusque, alterum vincendo veteranum, alterum novum totum, magna ex\r\nparte etiam tumultuarium et semiermem.] {I} [Ut conspecta inter se\r\nagmina sunt, et neutra pars detrectavit pugnam], extemplo +instructae\r\nacies+. {II} +Pugnatum+ tamen, ut in nulla pari re, duas amplius horas,\r\nconcitata et, [donec dux stetisset], Romana acie. {III} {Postquam is non\r\npro vetere fama solum, sed etiam metu futuri dedecoris, [si sua\r\ntemeritate contractae cladi superesset], obiectans se hostium telis\r\ncecidit}, +fusa+ extemplo +est Romana acies+. {IV} Sed adeo ne fugae\r\nquidem +iter patuit+ omnibus viis ab equite insessis, [ut ex tanta\r\nmultitudine vix mille evaserint, ceteri passim alii alia peste absumpti\r\nsint]. {V}\r\n\r\n        LIVY.\r\n\r\nDEMONSTRATION IV.\r\n\r\n  LIVY, xxv. 19.\r\n\r\n_Read through the Passage carefully._--The context will be familiar to\r\nyou, as this piece is a continuation of Demonstration III; but, none\r\nthe less, read the passage through very carefully.

You will remember what was said\r\nabout +res+ in Sentence I. of Part I. pp. 33, 34.\r\n\r\n(b) You must try to express more strongly the contrast in generalship\r\nbetween Hannibal and a mere centurion.

This use of +ut+ = _considering_ occurs\r\nfrequently--_e.g._ +consultissimus vir ut in illa quisquam esse aetate\r\npoterat+ (Livy). Cf. also p. 124, l. 19.  [[Selection C17, \"ut in re\r\ntrepida\"]]\r\n\r\n(c) +concitata Romana acie+ is clearly ablative absolute.

Thus:--\r\n\r\n(a) _It is too long._ You can remedy this by taking +postquam ...\r\ncecidit+ as one complete sentence, and +fusa ... acies+ as another.\r\n\r\n(b) _Exposing himself._ Better _exposed himself to ... and_.

The connection in thought is not shown: 'He\r\nis happy because he _knows_ and [therefore] fears not.'\r\n\r\n_groaning_--_i.e._ +gemitum+; +strepitum+ = _roar_, _din_.\r\n\r\n_Sentence III._--\r\n\r\n_by the people's axes_. This suggests quite a wrong idea; contrast the\r\nversion, 'by the honours that the people confer.'\r\n\r\n_sacred_. This is quite wrong. +con-iurato+ = _allied by oath_.\r\n\r\n_the affairs of Rome_. A very weak, and inadequate rendering.\r\n\r\n_Sentence IV._--\r\n\r\n_grieves for nor pities_. This quite obscures the point. Vergil says\r\nthat a country life, with its absence of poverty, so commonly met with\r\nin a town, saves a man from the necessity of feeling a pang of pity for\r\nthe poor.\r\n\r\nBefore you put aside this passage, try to avail yourself of some of the\r\nfollowing suggestions.

Of these the +Quaestores urbani+ stayed at\r\nRome, while the +Quaestores provinciales+ or +militares+ acted as\r\nfinancial assistants to the _Consuls_ or _Praetors_ for the provinces.\r\n\r\n+saeptum+ = _hedged in_; +saepes+ = _a hedge_, _fence_.\r\n\r\n+vepribus+ = _with bramble-bushes_.\r\n\r\n+dumetis+ = _with brushwood_.\r\n\r\n+indagavi+ = _I traced out_. A metaphor from hunting. Cf.\r\n\r\n  'Dum trepidant alae, saltusque indagine cingunt.'\r\n\r\n        Verg. _Aen._ iv. 121.\r\n\r\n'While the scouts (beaters) are all busy, and are encircling the coverts\r\nwith nets.'\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--The form of the sentence is quite simple. The\r\nprincipal verb is +indagavi+, with subject +ego quaestor+, and object\r\n+sepulcrum+. From +ignoratum ... dumetis+ describes +sepulcrum+, and the\r\nsubordinate clause +cum ... negarent+ emphasises +ignoratum a\r\nSyracusanis+. You may now translate\r\n\r\n(a) literally: _I, when Quaestor, traced out the tomb of Archimedes, not\r\nknown of by the Syracusans, for they said it was not there at all,\r\nhedged in on all sides and covered with brambles and brushwood._\r\n\r\n(b) A better rendering: _When I was Quaestor I was able to trace the\r\ntomb of Archimedes, overgrown and hedged in with brambles and brushwood.\r\nThe Syracusans knew nothing of it, and entirely denied its existence._\r\n\r\nNotice here the improvement made by breaking up the one long sentence\r\ninto two.\r\n\r\n+II.+ +Tenebam enim quosdam senariolos, quos in eius monumento esse\r\ninscriptos acceperam: qui declarabant in summo sepulcro sphaeram esse\r\npositam cum cylindro.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+senariolos+ = _some lines_, _i.e._ of poetry--dimin. of +senarius+\r\n(+seni+) = _consisting of six each_, especially of the _iambic senarii_.\r\n\r\n+sphaeram+ = _a sphere, globe_--#sphaira#.\r\n\r\n+cylindro+ = _a cylinder_, #kulindros#.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--The only principal verb is clearly +tenebam+ (with\r\nsubject contained in the verb), and the principal object +senariolos+\r\n(sc. +versus+). From +quos ... cylindro+ we have two subordinate\r\nadjectival clauses enlarging +senariolos+.\r\n\r\n_The fact is, I remembered some iambic lines which I had been told were\r\ninscribed on his monument, and which set forth that his tomb was\r\nsurmounted by a sphere and a cylinder._\r\n\r\n+III.+ +Ego autem, cum omnia collustrarem oculis--est enim ad portas\r\nAgragantinas magna frequentia sepulcrorum--animadverti columellam non\r\nmultum e dumis eminentem, in qua inerat sphaerae figura et cylindri.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+collustrarem+ = _I was surveying on all sides_; +con (cum) + lustro+.\r\n\r\n  +lustro+, perhaps akin to +luc-eo+, +lu-men+;\r\n  so, +il-lustris+ = _lighted up_, _illustrious_.\r\n\r\n+frequentia+ = _a large number_; cf. +frequens+, [Rt]#phrak#, +farc+;\r\ncf. #phrag-ma# = _a fence_, +farc-io+ = _pack close together_; so,\r\n+con-fer-tus+ = _crowded_, +freq-uens+ = _repeated_, _frequent_.\r\n\r\n+columellam+ = _a small column_, dimin. of +columen+, [Rt]cel; cf.\r\n+cel-sus+ = _lofty_; cf. +ex-cello+, +col-umen+ (= +cul-men+) = _the\r\nsummit_; cf. _culminate_.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--This sentence is apparently not quite so simple,\r\nbut if you carefully bracket the subordinate clauses you will see that\r\nthe only principal verb is +animadverti+, with subject +ego+ and object\r\n+columellam+. Notice next that--\r\n\r\n(a) +cum ... oculis+ modifies the principal verb +animadverti+ and is an\r\nadverbial clause of _time_.\r\n\r\n(b) The parenthetical clause +est enim ... sepulcrorum+ explains\r\n+collustrarem+.\r\n\r\n(c) +in qua ... cylindri+ is an adjectival clause enlarging\r\n+columellam+.\r\n\r\nYou may now translate into your best English, following closely the\r\nthought and the order of the Latin:--\r\n\r\n_Well, as I was surveying the whole place (there is a large number of\r\ntombs at[18] the Agrigentine gate) I perceived a small column just\r\nshowing above the undergrowth, on which appeared the figure of a sphere\r\nand a cylinder._\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: Var. lect. +ad portas Achradinas+.]\r\n\r\n+IV.+ +Atque ego statim Syracusanis--erant autem principes mecum--dixi\r\nme illud ipsum arbitrari esse, quod quaererem.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--The words of this sentence present no difficulty.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--With the practice you have now had, you may\r\ntranslate at once; but notice carefully that--\r\n\r\n(a) the parenthetical clause +erant ... mecum+ enlarges +Syracusanis+;\r\nand\r\n\r\n(b) +quod quaererem+ describes +illud ipsum+.\r\n\r\n_So I immediately said to the Syracusans who were with me (some people\r\nof importance) that I thought that was the very thing I was looking\r\nfor._\r\n\r\n+V.+ +Immissi cum falcibus multi purgarunt locum.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+falcibus+ = _with bill-hooks_; +falx+ perh. akin to +flect-o+ = _bend_,\r\nfrom its shape. Cf. _falcon_ (from its _hooked_ claws).\r\n\r\n+purgarunt+ = _cleared_; +purgo+, contr. from +pur-igo+ = +purum + ago+\r\n= _purge_. Cf. +pur-us+.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Translation._--\r\n\r\n_Some men sent in with bill-hooks cleared out the space._\r\n\r\n+VI.+ +Quo cum patefactus esset aditus, accessimus.+\r\n\r\n(i.) _Vocabulary._--\r\n\r\n+patefactus+ = _laid open_: +pateo + facio+.

He set sail from the Portus Ittius (mod.\r\nWissant, some twelve miles W. of Calais) and after drifting some way to\r\nthe N.E., made his way to his former landing-place, probably near\r\nRomney. Some severe fighting followed, till at length Caesar crossed the\r\nThames (apparently between Kingston and Brentford) and +entered the\r\ncountry of Cassivellaunus, who gave Caesar much trouble by his guerilla\r\ntactics.

As the\r\ntown was too strong to be taken by storm, he resolved to try a blockade,\r\nbut he failed, as at Dyrrachium in 49 B.C., from want of sufficient\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n+A last desperate attack on the town was repulsed+, and Caesar, defeated\r\nfor the first time, was forced to raise the siege.\r\n\r\n  [Linenotes:\r\n  3. +ab latere nostris aperto:+ as a soldier carries his shield on\r\n  the left arm, leaving the sword hand free, this (right) side is\r\n  called +latus apertum+.--Compton.\r\n  4. +manus distinendae causa+ = _for the purpose of diverting_\r\n  (+distinendae+, lit. _hold off_) _the enemy's force_.\r\n  6. +perterruerunt+: this was all the more natural, as the Aeduan\r\n  contingent was only awaiting the result of the blockade, to openly\r\n  join the insurgents.\r\n  9. +excidere+ = _to cut away_, _hew down_, i.e. from within.]\r\n\r\n+Gergovia+, 4 miles S. of Clermont.

By the Conference at Luca+ it was arranged:--\r\n\r\n(i) to give Caesar a new term of five years' government in which to\r\ncomplete his work in Gaul (until March 1, 49);\r\n\r\n(ii) to give Pompeius the government of the two Spains, and Crassus that\r\nof Syria, for five years also.\r\n\r\nIt was further agreed that Pompeius and Crassus should have the\r\nconsulship for 55 B.C.\r\n\r\n+52 B.C. Pompeius Sole Consul.+ So things continued until 52 B.C., when\r\nthe constant rioting (Clodius v. Milo), and utter lawlessness prevailing\r\nin Rome +gave Pompeius his opportunity+. The Senate in their distress\r\ncaused Pompeius to be nominated sole Consul, with supreme power to meet\r\nthe crisis. The death of Julia in 54 and of Crassus in 53 had removed\r\nthe two strongest influences for peace, and from 52 onwards the breach\r\nbetween Pompeius and Caesar began to widen.\r\n\r\nDuring Caesar's long absence from Rome his opponents, with Cato at their\r\nhead, were waiting their chance to impeach him for numerous acts in his\r\nprovince, as soon as he appeared in Rome for the consular elections. He\r\nwould then be merely a private citizen, and as such amenable to\r\nprosecution. Now Caesar's proconsulship of Gaul was to terminate on\r\nMarch 1, 49, and the consular elections would take place at the earliest\r\nin the following summer. +There would therefore be an interval between\r\nthe two offices+, and Caesar would be exposed to the utmost peril, if he\r\ngave up province and army on March 1, 49. Caesar had long foreseen this.\r\nWhen the law was passed in 55, which added a fresh term of five years to\r\nhis government, +Pompeius seems to have inserted in it+ (doubtless in\r\naccordance with a previous promise to Caesar) +a clause prohibiting the\r\ndiscussion of a successor before March 1, 50+. Caesar therefore could\r\nnot be superseded except by the consuls of 49, and these would not be\r\nable to succeed him (as proconsuls) till Jan. 1, 48. He would thus be\r\nable to retain his army and government throughout the year 49.\r\n\r\n+Caesar's canvass for the Consulship.+ As the law stood, he would have\r\nto come in person to Rome. But early in 52 +a decree was promulgated,\r\nwith the support of Pompeius, which relieved him from the necessity of\r\ncanvassing in person+. Caesar might now feel himself safe: he would\r\nretain both army and provinces throughout 49, and would not be forced to\r\nreturn to Rome until he was safe from prosecution as Consul.\r\n\r\n+Lex Pompeia de iure magistratuum.+ But this did not suit Caesar's\r\nenemies. Pompeius and the Senate combined to alter the whole legal\r\nmachinery for appointing provincial governors. +There was to be an\r\ninterval of five years between a consulship and a proconsulship+, which\r\nwould prevent Caesar, even if he were duly elected Consul in 49, from\r\nobtaining a fresh provincial governorship until five years from the end\r\nof 48. When the bill became law (as it did in 51) there would be an\r\ninterval of some years before any consuls would be qualified under it\r\nfor provinces: and to fill up the governorships during the interval, the\r\nSenate was authorised to appoint any person of consular rank who had not\r\nas yet proceeded to a proconsulship. +Thus Caesar's resignation both of\r\nhis army and his province could be demanded on March 1, 49.+\r\n\r\n+50 B.C. Caesar's overtures for peace.+ Caesar let it be known to the\r\nSenate through Curio that +he was willing to resign his army and\r\nprovinces if Pompeius would simultaneously do the same+: and the Senate\r\nvoted a resolution in this sense by a majority of 370 to 22. The\r\npresiding Consul, Gaius Marcellus, broke up the meeting in anger, and\r\nwith the two Consuls elected for 49 (Claudius Marcellus and Lentulus\r\nCrus) requested Pompeius to put himself at the head of the two legions\r\nstationed at Capua and to call the Italian militia to arms.\r\n\r\n+Caesar had completely attained the object of devolving the initiative\r\nof Civil War on his opponents.+ He had, while himself keeping on legal\r\nground, compelled Pompeius to declare war, and to declare it not as the\r\nrepresentative of the legitimate authority, but as general of a\r\nrevolutionary minority of the Senate, which overawed the majority.\r\n--_Adapted from Long, Mommsen, and Warde Fowler._\r\n\r\n\r\nB50\r\n\r\nCIVIL WAR, 49-45 B.C.

Troops\r\nwere landed by night: Caesar's outer line of defence was carried, and\r\nhis lines broken through. 'Like Wellington at Burgos in 1812, Caesar\r\nfailed from want of a sufficient force.

(He\r\nhad been sent with two legions E. into Macedonia, to stop reinforcements\r\nfor Pompeius under Scipio, Pompeius' father-in-law.)

Pompeius stationed his\r\ncavalry and archers on his left, and confidently expected to outflank\r\nhis enemy's right. But Caesar, foreseeing the defeat of his cavalry, had\r\nstationed behind it in reserve 2000 of his best legionaries. When\r\nCaesar's cavalry fell back outnumbered, this reserve ran forward at the\r\ncharge, not discharging their _pila_, but using them as spears, and\r\ndriving them against man and horse. Taken aback by so unusual an\r\ninfantry attack, the Pompeian cavalry wavered and fled. Caesar's third\r\nline (forming a rear-guard) was now sent forward to support the two\r\nfront lines, and this decided the battle. --+Result.+ Submission of the\r\nEast to Caesar.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHARSALUS.

His troops were quickly arranged as at\r\nPharsalus, and by a single impetuous charge won a complete victory.

To\r\nthis he owed the power of living energetically in the present,\r\nundisturbed either by recollection or by expectation: to this he owed\r\nthe capacity of acting at any moment with collected vigour, and of\r\napplying his whole genius even to the smallest and most incidental\r\nenterprise. Gifts such as these could not fail to produce a statesman.\r\n\r\n+Caesar as a statesman.+--From early youth Caesar was a statesman in the\r\ndeepest sense of the term, and his aim was the +political, military,\r\nintellectual, and moral regeneration of his own deeply decayed nation,\r\nand of the still more deeply decayed Hellenic nation intimately akin to\r\nhis own+. According to his original plan, he had proposed to reach his\r\nobject, like Pericles and Gaius Gracchus, without force of arms, until,\r\nreluctantly convinced of the necessity for a military support, he, when\r\nalready forty years of age, put himself at the head of an army.\r\n\r\n+His talent for organisation was marvellous.+--No statesman has ever\r\ncompelled alliances, no general has ever collected an army out of\r\nunyielding and refractory elements with such decision, and kept them\r\ntogether with such firmness, as Caesar displayed in constraining and\r\nupholding his coalitions and his legions; never did regent judge his\r\ninstruments and assign each to the place appropriate for him with so\r\naccurate an eye.\r\n\r\n+He was monarch; but he never played the king.+--'I am no king, but\r\nCaesar.' Even when absolute lord of Rome, he retained the deportment of\r\nthe party-leader; perfectly pliant and smooth, easy and charming in\r\nconversation, complaisant towards everyone, it seemed as if he wished io\r\nbe nothing but the first among his peers.\r\n\r\nCaesar ruled as king of Rome for five years and a half, not half as long\r\nas Alexander: in the intervals of seven great campaigns, which allowed\r\nhim to stay not more than fifteen months altogether in the capital of\r\nhis empire, +he regulated the destinies of the world for the present and\r\nthe future+. The outlines were laid down, and thereby the new State was\r\ndefined for all coming time: the boundless future alone could complete\r\nthe structure. But precisely because the building was an endless one,\r\nthe master so long as he lived restlessly added stone to stone, with\r\nalways the same dexterity and always the same elasticity busy at work.\r\nThus he worked and created as never did any man before or after him: and\r\nas a worker and creator he still, after well-nigh two thousand years,\r\nlives in the memory of the nations--the first and withal unique\r\nImperator Caesar.\r\n\r\n        MOMMSEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nB67\r\n\r\nCICERO AND ANTONIUS.\r\n\r\nA. _Peroration of the Second Philippic, 44 B.C._\r\n\r\nRespice, quaeso, aliquando rem publicam, M.

You will do well to follow closely this advice of\r\nexperienced teachers:--'Read every word as if it were the last on the\r\npage, and you had to turn over without being able to turn back. If,\r\nhowever, you are obliged to turn back, begin again at the beginning of\r\nthe sentence and proceed as before. Let each word of the Latin suggest\r\nsome conception gradually adding to and completing the meaning of the\r\nwriter. If the form of the word gives several possibilities, hold them\r\nall in your mind, so far as may be, till something occurs in the\r\nprogress of the sentence to settle the doubt.'\r\n\r\n1. +Tres ferme horas+ = _for nearly three hours_. This construction\r\n(Acc. of extent of time) will be familiar to you. Notice the emphatic\r\nposition of the phrase.\r\n\r\n+pugnatum est+ = _the battle was fought_. This use of the so-called\r\nimpersonal passive is very frequent, and is generally best translated by\r\ntaking the root-idea of the verb as a subject.\r\n\r\n+et ubique atrociter+ = _and everywhere fiercely_.\r\n\r\n2. +circa consulem tamen+ = _around the consul however_.\r\n\r\n+acrior infestiorque pugna est+ = _the battle is more keen and more\r\nvehement_. This presents no difficulty; +acrior+ and +infestior+ must\r\nqualify +pugna+, which follows immediately.\r\n\r\n3. +eum+ = _him_, plainly _consulem_ (i.e. Flaminius), for no one else\r\nhas been mentioned. Notice the emphatic position of +eum+.\r\n\r\n+et robora virorum sequebantur+ = _both the strongest of his troops\r\nfollowed_. You may know that +robur+ (lit. _hard wood_) is often used of\r\n_the toughest troops_, _the flower of an army_.\r\n\r\n+et ipse+ = _and himself_, i.e. the consul (Flaminius).\r\n\r\n3-4. +quacunque in parte+ = _in whatever part_.\r\n\r\n4. +premi ac laborare senserat suos+ = _he had seen his men hard pressed\r\nand in distress_. No other meaning is possible, nor does the order\r\npresent any difficulty, but notice the emphatic position of +suos+.\r\n\r\n4-5. +impigre ferebat opem+ = _actively he bore help_.\r\n\r\n5. +insignemque armis+ = _and distinguished by his arms_, clearly\r\nreferring to +consulem+ (l. 2). Cf. +eum+ (l. 3).\r\n\r\n+et hostes summa vi petebant+ = _both the enemy with all their might\r\nattacked_. +et+ might, of course, = _also_ (cf. +et+, l. 2), but the\r\nsecond +et+ which immediately follows determines the meaning _both_.\r\n\r\n6. +et tuebantur cives+ = _and his fellow-citizens_ (Romans) _defended_\r\n(him).\r\n\r\n+donec Insuber eques+ = _until an Insubrian trooper_. +donec+ may mean\r\n_while_, but the context shows that _until_ or _at last_ is the right\r\nmeaning here.\r\n\r\n6-7. +Ducario nomen erat+ = (his) _name was Ducarius_, i.e. _ei nomen\r\nerat Ducario_, where +Ducario+ is possess. dat. in appos. to _ei_\r\nunderstood. It is, however, possible that the trooper's name was\r\nDucario, but cf. page 126, l. 2.  [[Selection C19, line 645]]\r\n\r\n7. +facie quoque noscitans consulem+ = _by his face also_ (i.e. as well\r\nas by his armour) _recognising the consul_.\r\n\r\n7-8. +'En' inquit 'his est' popularibus suis+ = _See, said he, to his\r\nfellow-countrymen_ (comrades), _this is the man_.\r\n\r\n8. +qui legiones nostras cecîdit+ = _who slaughtered our legions_. There\r\nis a slight difficulty here, but a moment's thought will remove it. It\r\nmust be +cecîdit+, perf. of _caedo_, and not _cec[)i]dit_, perf. of\r\n_cado_, which is intransitive.\r\n\r\n8-9. +agrosque et urbem est depopulatus+ = _and laid waste our fields\r\nand our city_.\r\n\r\n9-10. +Iam ego hanc victimam mânibus peremptorum foede civium dabo+ =\r\n_now I will give this victim to the shades of our countrymen foully\r\nslain_. +Mânibus+ cannot = _hands_ (_m[)a]nibus_), for +peremptorum\r\ncivium+, which immediately follows, fixes the right meaning.\r\n\r\n10-11. +subditisque calcaribus equo+ = _and putting spurs to his horse_.\r\nYou will not attempt to translate this Abl. Absol. literally.\r\n\r\n11-12. +per confertissimam hostium turbam impetum facit+ = _through the\r\nclosely packed crowd of the enemy he makes his charge_.\r\n\r\n12. +obtruncatoque prius armigero+ = _and first cut down the\r\narmour-bearer_ (i.e. of Flaminius).\r\n\r\n12-13. +qui se infesto venienti obviam obiecerat+ = _who had thrown\r\nhimself in the way of him advancing at the charge_.\r\n\r\n+infesto venienti+ is clearly dative with +obviam+.\r\n\r\n13. +consulem lancea transfixit+ = _ran the Consul through with his\r\nlance_.\r\n\r\n13-14. +spoliare cupientem+ = (him, i.e. Ducarius) _wishing to spoil_\r\n(the consul).\r\n\r\n14. +triarii obiectis scutis arcuere+ = _the triarii_ (veterans)\r\n_thrusting their shields in the way kept off_.\r\n\r\nThis passage is quite simple, but it will serve to show you how you may\r\nwith practice learn to +take the thought in the Latin order+, and to\r\ngrasp the writer's meaning. All that now remains for you to do is to\r\nwrite out a translation in good English, using short coordinate\r\nsentences, each complete in itself, in place of the more involved\r\nstructure of the original. The following version by the late Professor\r\nJebb will serve as a model:--\r\n\r\nThey fought for about three hours, and everywhere with desperation.\r\nAround the consul, however, the fight was peculiarly keen and vehement.\r\nHe had the toughest troops with him; and he himself, whenever he saw\r\nthat his men were hard pressed, was indefatigable in coming to the\r\nrescue. Distinguished by his equipment, he was a target for the enemy\r\nand a rallying-point for the Romans. At last a Lombard trooper, named\r\nDucario, recognising the person as well as the guise of the consul,\r\ncried out to his people, 'Here is the man who cut our legions to pieces\r\nand sacked our city--now I will give this victim to the shades of our\r\nmurdered countrymen.' Putting spurs to his horse, he dashed through the\r\nthick of the foe. First he cut down the armour-bearer, who had thrown\r\nhimself in the way of the onset. Then he drove his lance through the\r\nconsul. He was trying to despoil the corpse, when some veterans screened\r\nit with their shields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VI\r\n\r\nSHORT LIVES OF ROMAN AUTHORS\r\n\r\n\r\nDECIMUS MAGNUS AUSONIUS, 309-392 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AUSONIUS.]\r\n\r\nBorn at Burdigala (_Bordeaux_), and carefully educated. At the age of\r\nthirty appointed professor of rhetoric in his native University, where\r\nhe became so famous that he was appointed tutor to Gratian, son of the\r\nEmperor Valentinian (364-375 A.D.), and was afterwards raised to the\r\nhighest honours of the State (Consul, 379 A.D.). Theodosius (Emperor of\r\nthe East, 378-395 A.D.) gave him leave to retire from court to his\r\nnative country, where he closed his days in an honoured literary\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nA very voluminous writer both in prose and verse.\r\n\r\n1. Prose: The only extant specimen is his _Gratiarum Actio_ to Gratianus\r\nfor the Consulship.\r\n\r\n2. Verse: Of this we have much: it has little value as poetry, but in\r\npoint of contents and diction it is interesting and valuable. Some of\r\nhis _Epigrammata_ and _Epitaphia_ are worth preserving, but his claim to\r\nrank as a poet rests on his _Mosella_, a beautiful description of the R.\r\nMoselle, which is worthy to be compared with Pliny's description of the\r\nR. Clitumnus (_Ep._ viii. 8).\r\n\r\n'In virtue of this poem Ausonius ranks not merely as the last, or all\r\nbut the last, of Latin, but as the first of French poets.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAIUS JULIUS CAESAR, 102 (or 100?)-44 B.C.\r\n\r\n1.

It describes the events of the Civil War\r\nduring the years 49-48 B.C. Book III. ends abruptly with the words:\r\n\r\n_Haec initia belli Alexandrini fuerunt._\r\n\r\n  BOOK  I. B.C. 49.

Style.\r\n\r\nRemarkable for brevity, directness, and simplicity. The simplest facts\r\ntold in the simplest way. _Ars est celare artem._\r\n\r\n'Caesar's Commentaries are worthy of all praise; they are unadorned,\r\nstraightforward, and elegant, every ornament being stripped off as if it\r\nwere a garment.' --CICERO.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCUS PORCIUS CATO, 234-149 B.C.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CATO.]\r\n\r\nFor his military and political career, his Consulship (195 B.C.), his\r\nfamous Censorship (184 B.C.), and his social reforms, see some good\r\nhistory, e.g. Mommsen, vol, iii.\r\n\r\n2.  Works.\r\n\r\nHis chief works are:--\r\n\r\n(1) His treatise +De Re Rustica+ or +De Agri Cultura+ (his only extant\r\nwork).--A series of terse and pointed directions following one on\r\nanother, somewhat in the manner of Hesiod, and interesting 'as showing\r\nthe practical Latin style, and as giving the prose groundwork of\r\nVergil's stately and beautiful embroidery in the _Georgics_.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n(2) +The Origines.+--'The oldest historical work written in Latin, and\r\nthe first important prose work in Roman literature.' --Mommsen. Nepos,\r\n_Cato_, 3, summarises the contents of the seven books.\r\n\r\nCato struggled all his life against Greek influence in literature and in\r\nmanners, which he felt would be fatal to his ideal of a Roman citizen.\r\nIn a letter to his son Marcus he says _Quandoque ista gens suas litteras\r\ndabit, omnia corrumpet_. He was famous for his homely wisdom, which\r\ngained him the title of _Sapiens_, e.g. _Rem tene: verba\r\nsequentur_--'Take care of the sense: the words will take care of\r\nthemselves.'\r\n\r\n\r\nGAIUS VALERIUS CATULLUS, circ. 84-54 B.C.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CATULLUS.]\r\n\r\nBorn at Verona, of a family of wealth and position, as is seen from his\r\nhaving estates at Sirmio:--\r\n\r\n_Salve, O venusta Sirmio, atque ero gaude_ (C. 31)\r\n\r\nand near Tibur: _O funde noster seu Sabine seu Tiburs_ (C. 44). His\r\nfather was an intimate friend of Caesar. He went to Rome early, where he\r\nspent the greater part of his short life,\r\n\r\n          _Romae vivimus: illa domus,\r\n  Illa mihi sedes, illic mea carpitur aetas_ (C. 68),\r\n\r\nwith the exception of an official journey to Bithynia, 57 B.C. to better\r\nhis fortunes: cf. _Iam ver egelidos refert tepores ... Linquantur\r\nPhrygii, Catulle, campi_ (C. 46). After a life of poetic culture and\r\nfree social enjoyment he died at the early age of thirty, 'the young\r\nCatullus,' _hedera iuvenilia tempora cinctus_ (Ovid, _Am._ III. ix. 61).\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n116 poems written in various metres and on various subjects, Lyric,\r\nElegiac, Epic.\r\n\r\n'The event which first revealed the full power of his genius, and which\r\nmade both the supreme happiness and supreme misery of his life, was his\r\nlove for Lesbia (Clodia).'--Sellar.\r\n\r\n'Catullus is one of the great poets of the world, not so much through\r\nvividness of imagination as through his singleness of nature, his vivid\r\nimpressibility, and his keen perception. He received the gifts of the\r\npassing hour so happily that to produce pure and lasting poetry it was\r\nenough for him to utter in natural words something of the fulness of his\r\nheart. He says on every occasion exactly what he wanted to say, in\r\nclear, forcible, spontaneous language.' --Sellar.\r\n\r\n'The most attractive feature in the character of Catullus is the warmth\r\nof his affection. If to love warmly, constantly, and unselfishly be the\r\nbest title to the love of others, few poets in any age or country\r\ndeserve a kindlier place in the hearts of men than \"the young\r\nCatullus.\"'--Sellar.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCUS TULLIUS CICERO, 106-43 B.C.\r\n\r\n1.

Works.\r\n\r\n(1) +Speeches.+--We possess 57 speeches, and fragments of about 20 more,\r\nand we know of 33 others delivered by Cicero.\r\n\r\n'As a speaker and orator Cicero succeeded in gaining a place beside\r\nDemosthenes. His strongest point is his style; there he is clear,\r\nconcise and apt, perspicuous, elegant and brilliant. He commands all\r\nmoods, from playful jest to tragic pathos, but is most successful in the\r\nimitation of conviction and feeling, to which he gave increased\r\nimpression by his fiery delivery.' --Teuffel. Quintilian says of him\r\nthat his eloquence combined the power of Demosthenes, the copiousness of\r\nPlato, and the sweetness of Isocrates.\r\n\r\n(2) +Philosophical Works.+--The chief are the _De Republica_ (closed by\r\nthe _Sommium Sciponis_): the _De Legibus_: the _De Finibus Bonorum et\r\nMalorum_: the _Academics_: _Tusculan Disputations_ with the _De\r\nDivinatione_: the _De Senectute_ and _De Amicitia_: _De natura Deorum_,\r\nand the _De Officiis_.\r\n\r\nAs a philosopher Cicero had no pretensions to originality. He found the\r\nmaterials for most of these works in the writings of the Greek\r\nphilosophers. 'I have to supply little but the words,' he writes, 'and\r\nfor these I am never at a loss.' It was however no small achievement to\r\nmould the Latin tongue to be a vehicle for Greek philosophic thought,\r\nand thus to render the conclusions of Greek thinkers accessible to his\r\nown countrymen.\r\n\r\n(3) +Rhetorical treatises.+--The chief are the _De Oratore_ (in 3\r\nBooks), perhaps the most finished example of the Ciceronian style: the\r\n_Brutus_ or _De Claris Oratoribus_, and the _Orator_ (or _De optime\r\nGenere Dicendi_).\r\n\r\n(4) +Letters.+--Besides 774 letters written by Cicero, we have 90\r\naddressed to him by friends. The two largest collections of his Letters\r\nare the _Epistulae ad Atticum_ (68-43 B.C.) and the _Epistulae ad\r\nFamiliares_ (62-43 B.C.).\r\n\r\nThese letters are of supreme importance for the history of Cicero's\r\ntime. 'The quality which makes them most valuable is that they were not\r\n(like the letters of Pliny, and Seneca, and Madame de Sévigné) written\r\nto be published. We see in them Cicero as he was. We behold him in his\r\nstrength and in his weakness--the bold advocate, and yet timid and\r\nvacillating statesman, the fond husband, the affectionate father, the\r\nkind master, the warm-hearted friend.' --Tyrrell.\r\n\r\nThe style of the Letters is colloquial but thoroughly accurate. 'The art\r\nof letter-writing suddenly rose in Cicero's hands to its full\r\nperfection.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n(5) +Poems.+--The fragments we possess show that verse-writing came\r\neasily to him, but he never could have been a great poet, for he had not\r\nthe _divinus afflatus_, so finely expressed by Ovid in the line _Est\r\nDeus in nobis, agitante calescimus illo_.\r\n\r\n'Cicero stands in prose like Vergil in poetry, as the bridge between the\r\nancient and the modern world. Before his time Latin prose was, from a\r\nwide point of view, but one among many local ancient dialects. As it\r\nleft his hands it had become a universal language, one which had\r\ndefinitely superseded all others, Greek included, as the type of\r\ncivilised expression.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAUDIUS CLAUDIANUS, flor. 400 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CLAUDIAN.]\r\n\r\nBorn probably at Alexandria, where he lived until, in the year of the\r\ndeath of Theodosius 395 A.D., he acquired the patronage of Stilicho, the\r\ngreat Vandal general, who, as guardian of the young Emperor Honorius,\r\nwas practically ruler of the Western Empire. He remained attached to the\r\nCourt at Milan, Rome and Ravenna, and died soon after the downfall of\r\nhis patron Stilicho, 408 A.D.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nIn his historical epics he derived his subjects from his own age,\r\npraising his patrons Stilicho (_On the Consulate of Stilicho_) and\r\nHonorius (_on the Consulate of Honorius_), and inveighing against\r\nRufinus and Eutropius, the rivals of Stilicho. Of poems on other\r\nsubjects, 'his three books of the unfinished Rape of Proserpine are\r\namong the finest examples of the purely literary epic.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n'Claudian is the last of the Latin poets, forming the transitional link\r\nbetween the Classic and the Gothic mode of thought.' --Coleridge.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\n'His faults belong almost as much to the age as to the writer. In\r\ndescription he is too copious and detailed: his poems abound with long\r\nspeeches: his parade of varied learning, his partiality for abstruse\r\nmythology, are just the natural defects of a lettered but uninspired\r\nepoch.' --North Pinder.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUINTUS ENNIUS, 239-169 B.C.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ENNIUS.]\r\n\r\nHe was born at Rudiae in Calabria (about 19 miles S. of Brundisium),\r\na meeting-place of three different languages, that of common life\r\n(Oscan, cf. _Opici_), that of culture and education (Greek), that of\r\nmilitary service (Latin). Here he lived for some twenty years, availing\r\nhimself of those means of education which at this time were denied to\r\nRome or Latium. We next hear of him serving as centurion in Sardinia,\r\nwhere he attracted the attention of Cato, then quaestor, and accompanied\r\nhim to Rome, 204 B.C. Here for some fifteen years he lived plainly,\r\nsupporting himself by teaching Greek, and making translations of Greek\r\nplays for the Roman stage, and so won the friendship of the elder\r\nScipio. In 189 B.C. M. Fulvius Nobilior took Ennius with him in his\r\ncampaign against the Aetolians, as a witness and herald of his deeds.\r\nHis son obtained for Ennius the Roman citizenship (184 B.C.) by giving\r\nhim a grant of land at Potentia in Picenum. _Nos sumus Romani, qui\r\nfuimus ante Rudini._ The rest of his life was spent mainly at Rome in\r\ncheerful simplicity and active literary work.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nThe chief are:--\r\n\r\n(1) +Tragedies.+--Mainly translations, especially from Euripides. A few\r\nfragments only remain. 'It was certainly due to Ennius that Roman\r\nTragedy was first raised to that pitch of popular favour which it\r\nenjoyed till the age of Cicero.' --Sellar.\r\n\r\n(2) +Annales.+--An Epic Hexameter poem, in 18 books, which dealt with\r\nthe History of Rome from the landing of Aeneas in Italy down to the\r\nThird Macedonian War (Pydna, 168 B.C.). About 600 lines are extant.\r\n\r\n'In his Annals he unfolds a long gallery of national portraits. His\r\nheroes are men of one common aim--the advancement of Rome; animated with\r\none sentiment, devotion to the State. All that was purely personal in\r\nthem seems merged in the traditional pictures which express only the\r\nfortitude, dignity and sagacity of the Republic.' --Sellar.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\nFor the first time Ennius succeeded in moulding the Latin language to\r\nthe movement of the Greek hexameter. In spite of imperfections and\r\nroughness, his _Annals_ remained the foremost and representative Roman\r\npoem till Vergil wrote the _Aeneid_. Lucretius, whom he influenced, and\r\nto whom Vergil owes so much, says of him:\r\n\r\n  _Ennius ut noster cecinit, qui primus amoeno\r\n  Detulit ex Helicone perenni fronde coronam,\r\n  Per gentes Italas honinum quae clara clueret;_\r\n\r\n    'As sang our Ennius, the first who brought down from\r\n    pleasant Helicon a chaplet of unfading leaf, the fame of\r\n    which should ring out clear through the nations of Italy.'\r\n\r\nAnd later, Quintilian, X. i. 88: 'Ennium sicut sacros vetustate lucos\r\nadoremus, in quibus grandia et antiqua robora iam non tantam habent\r\nspeciem quantam religionem: Let us venerate Ennius like the groves,\r\nsacred from their antiquity, in which the great and ancient oak-trees\r\nare invested, not so much with beauty, as with sacred associations.'\r\n--Sellar.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS EUTROPIUS, fl. 375 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EUTROPIUS.]\r\n\r\nVery little is known of his life. He is said to have held the office of\r\na secretary under Contanstine the Great (_ob._ 337 A.D.), and to have\r\nserved under the Emperor Julian in his ill-fated expedition against the\r\nPersians, 363 A.D.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nHis only extant work is his\r\n\r\n+Breviarium Historiae Romanae.+--A brief compendium of Roman History in\r\nten books from the foundation of the city to the accession of Valens,\r\n364 A.D., to whom it is inscribed.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\nHis work is a compilation made from the best authorities, with good\r\njudgment and impartiality, and in a simple style. Its brevity and\r\npractical arrangement made it very popular.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORUS, circ. 120 (or 140?) A.D. (temp. Hadrian).\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FLORUS.]\r\n\r\nL. Julius (or Annaeus) Florus lived at Rome in the time of Trajan or\r\nHadrian. Little else is known of his life.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nAn Epitome of the Wars of Livy, in two Books:--\r\n\r\n  Book I. treats of the good time of Rome, 753-133 B.C. (the\r\n             Gracchi).\r\n\r\n    \" II. treats of the decline of Rome, 133-29 B.C. (Temple of\r\n             Janus closed).\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\nA pretentious and smartly written work abounding in mistakes,\r\ncontradictions, and misrepresentations of historical truth. It was,\r\nhowever, popular in the Middle Ages on account of its brevity and its\r\nrhetorical style. Florus is useful in giving us a short account of\r\nevents in periods where we have no books of Livy to guide us.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. JULIUS FRONTINUS, circ. 41-103 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRONTINUS.]\r\n\r\nHe was _praetor urbanus_ 70 A.D., and in 75 succeeded Cerealis as\r\ngovernor oi Britain, where, as Tacitus tells us, he distinguished\r\nhimself by the conquest of the Silures: _sustinuit molem Iulius\r\nFrontinus, vir magnus, quantum licebat, validamque et pugnacem Siturum\r\ngentem armis subegit_: 'Julius Frontinus was equal to the burden,\r\na great man as far as greatness was then possible (i.e. under the\r\njealous rule of Domitian), who subdued by his arms the powerful and\r\nwarlike tribe of the Silures.'\r\n\r\nIn 97 he was nominated _curator aquarum_, administrator of the aqueducts\r\nof Rome: the closing years of his life were passed in studious\r\nretirement at his villa on the Bay of Naples. Cf. Mart. X. lviii.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nTwo works of his are extant:--\r\n\r\n(1) +De Aquis Urbis Romae.+--A treatise on the Roman water-supply,\r\npublished under Trajan, soon after the death of Nerva, 97 A.D.; a\r\ncomplete and valuable account.\r\n\r\n(2) +Strategemata.+--A manual of strategy, in three books, consisting of\r\nhistorical examples derived chiefly from Sallust, Caesar, and Livy.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\nSimple and concise: 'he shuns the conceits of the period and goes back\r\nto the republican authors, of whom (and especially of Caesar's\r\nCommentaries) his language strongly reminds us.' --Cruttwell.\r\n\r\nAs a mark of his unaffected modesty, Pliny (_Ep._ ix. 19) tells us:\r\n_vetuit exstrui monimentum: sed quibus verbis? 'impensa monimenta\r\nsupervacua est: memoria nostri durabit, si vita meruimus_.'\r\n\r\n\r\nAULUS GELLIUS, circ. 123-175 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GELLIUS.]\r\n\r\nAll that is known about his life is gathered from occasional hints in\r\nhis own writings. He seems to have spent his early years at Rome,\r\nstudying under the most famous teachers, first at Rome and afterwards at\r\nAthens, and then to have returned to Rome, where he spent the remaining\r\nyears of his life in literary pursuits and in the society of a large\r\ncircle of friends.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nThe +Noctes Atticae+ (so called because it was begun during the long\r\nnights of winter in a country house in Attica) in twenty books consists\r\nof numerous extracts from Greek and Roman writers on subjects connected\r\nwith history, philosophy, philology, natural science and antiquities,\r\nillustrated by abundant criticisms and discussions. It is, in fact,\r\na commonplace book, and the arrangement of the contents is merely\r\ncasual, following the course of his reading of Greek and Latin authors.\r\nThe work is, however, of special value to us from the very numerous\r\nquotations from ancient authors preserved by him alone.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\nHis language is sober but full of archaisms, which he much affected (he\r\ngives, therefore, no quotations from post-Augustan writers). His style\r\nshows the defects of an age in which men had ceased to feel the full\r\nmeaning of the words they used, and strove to hide the triviality of a\r\nsubject under obscure phrases and florid expression. Yet, on the whole,\r\nhe is a very interesting writer, and the last that can in any way be\r\ncalled classical.\r\n\r\n'_Vir elegantissimi eloquii et multae ac facundae scientiae._' --St.\r\nAugustine, 400 A.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS, 65-8 B.C.\r\n\r\n1. Important Events in the Life of Horace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HORACE.]\r\n\r\n  B.C. 65. Born at Venusia (_Venosa_) on the confines of Apulia and\r\n             Lucania.\r\n   \"  53-46. Educated at Rome under the famous _plagosus_ Orbilius.\r\n   \"  46-44. At the University of Athens.\r\n   \"  44-42. Served under Brutus as _tribunus militum_: fought at\r\n             Philippi.\r\n   \"  42-39. Pardoned by Octavianus and allowed to return to Rome.\r\n             His poverty compelled him to write verses, prob. _Sat._ I,\r\n             ii. iii. iv., and some _Epodes_. Through these he obtained\r\n             the notice of Varius and Vergil, who became his fast\r\n             friends and\r\n   \"   38. introduced him to Maecenas, the trusted minister of Augustus.\r\n   \"   35. +Satires, Book I+ published.

For fullest description see _Epist._\r\n             I. xvi.\r\n   \"   31. +Satires, Book II+, and +Epodes+ published.\r\n   \"   23. +Odes, Books I-III+ published.\r\n   \"   20. +Epistles, Book I+ published.\r\n   \"   17. +Carmen Saeculare+ written at the request of Augustus for\r\n             the _Ludi Saeculares_.\r\n   \"   13. +Odes, Book IV+ published.\r\n   \"   12. +Epistles, Book II+ published.\r\n   \"    8. Died in the same year as his friend and patron Maecenas.\r\n\r\n  3. Works.\r\n\r\n(1) +Odes+, in four books, and +Epodes+.--The words of Cicero (_pro\r\nArchia_ 16) best describe the abiding value of the four Books of the\r\nOdes--_Adolescentiam alunt_ (strengthen), _senectutem oblectant,\r\nsecundas res ornant, adversis perfugium ac solacium praebent, delectant\r\ndomi, non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobiscum, peregrinantur,\r\nrusticantur_. In them we see a poet, as Quintilian says, _verbis\r\nfelicissime audax_--most happily daring in his use of words and endowed,\r\nas Petronius says, with _curiosa felicitas_, a subtle happiness of\r\nexpression--'what oft was thought but ne'er so well express'd.'\r\n\r\n(2) +Satires (Sermones)+ in two Books.--Horace's chief model is\r\nLucilius, whom he wished to adapt to the Augustan age. To touch on\r\npolitical topics was impossible; Horace employed satire to display his\r\nown individuality and his own views on various subjects. Book I (his\r\nearliest effort) is marred by faults in execution and is often wanting\r\nin good taste; but in Book II 'he uses the hexameter to exhibit the\r\nsemi-dramatic form of easy dialogue, with a perfection as complete as\r\nthat of Vergil in the stately and serious manner. In reading these\r\nSatires we all read our own minds and hearts.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n(3) +The Epistles (Sermones)+ in two Books, and +Ars Poetica+ (_Ep. ad\r\nPisones_).--These represent his most mature production. As a poet Horace\r\nnow stood without a rival. Life was still full of vivid interest for\r\nhim, but years (_fallentis semita vitae_) had brought the philosophic\r\nmind. 'To teach the true end and wise regulation of life, and to act on\r\ncharacter from within, are the motives of the more formal and elaborate\r\nepistles.' --Sellar.\r\n\r\nThe +Ars Poetica+ is a _résumé_ of Greek criticism on the drama.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\n'With the principal lyric metres, the Sapphic and Alcaic, Horace had\r\ndone what Vergil had accomplished with the dactylic hexameter, carried\r\nthem to the highest point of which the foreign Latin tongue was\r\ncapable.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n'As Vergil is the most idealising exponent of what was of permanent and\r\nuniversal significance in the time, Horace is the most complete exponent\r\nof its actual life and movement. He is at once the lyrical poet, with\r\nheart and imagination responsive to the deeper meaning and lighter\r\namusements of life, and the satirist, the moralist, and the literary\r\ncritic of the age.' --Sellar.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTINUS, circ. 150 A.D. (_temp._ Antoninus Pius).\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JUSTINUS.]\r\n\r\nWe know nothing positively about him, though probably he lived in the\r\nage of the Antonines. Teuffel says 'Considering his correct mode of\r\nthinking and the style of his preface, we should not like to put him\r\nmuch later than Florus, who epitomised Livy.'\r\n\r\n2.  Works.\r\n\r\n+Epitoma Historiarum Philippicarum Pompei Trogi+, in forty-four\r\nBooks.--An abridgment of the Universal History of Pompeius Trogus\r\n(_temp._ Livy). The title _Historiae Philippicae_ was given to it by\r\nTrogus because its main object was to give the history of the Macedonian\r\nmonarchy, with all its branches, but he allowed himself, like Herodotus,\r\nto indulge in such large digressions that it was regarded by many as a\r\nUniversal History. It was arranged according to nations; it began with\r\nNinus, the Nimrod of legend, and was brought down to about 9 A.D.\r\n\r\n3.  Style.\r\n\r\nJustinus (as he tells us in his Preface) made it his business to form an\r\nattractive reading-book--_breve veluti florum corpusculum feci_ (an\r\nanthology)--and his chief merit is that he seems to have been a faithful\r\nabbreviator.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECIMUS JUNIUS JUVENALIS, 55-138 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JUVENAL.]\r\n\r\nOf Juvenal's life very little is certainly known. Thirteen lives of him\r\nexist, which are confused and contradictory in detail. From the\r\nevidences of the Satires we learn that he lived from early youth at\r\nRome, but went for holidays to Aquinum, a town of the Volscians (where\r\nperhaps he was born in the reign of Nero); that he had a small farm at\r\nTibur, and a house in Rome, where he entertained his friends in a modest\r\nway; that he had been in Egypt; that he wrote Satires late in life; that\r\nhe reached his eightieth year, and lived into the reign of Antoninus\r\nPius. He complains frequently and bitterly of his poverty and of the\r\nhardships of a dependent's life. In short, the circumstances of his life\r\nwere very similar to those of Martial, who speaks of Juvenal as a very\r\nintimate friend.\r\n\r\nThe famous inscription at Aquinum--which Duff considers does not refer\r\nto the poet but to a wealthy kinsman of his--indicates that he had\r\nserved in the army as commander of a Dalmatian cohort, and, as one of\r\nthe chief men of the town, was superintendent of the civic worship paid\r\nto Vespasian after his deification.\r\n\r\nAll the Lives assert that Juvenal was banished to Egypt--Juvenal himself\r\nnever alludes to this--for offence given to an actor who was high in\r\nfavour with the reigning Emperor (Hadrian according to Prof. Hardy), and\r\nthat he died in exile.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+Saturae+, sixteen, grouped in five Books.\r\n\r\nBooks I-III (Satires 1-9) are sharply divided both in form and substance\r\nfrom Books IV-V (Satires 10-16), which are not satires at all, but moral\r\nessays, in the form of letters. The first nine satires present a\r\nwonderfully vivid picture of the seamy side of life at Rome at the end\r\nof the first century. We must, however, read side by side with them the\r\ncontemporary Letters of Pliny, in which we find ourselves in a different\r\nworld from that scourged by the satirist.\r\n\r\n'His chief literary qualities are his power of painting lifelike scenes,\r\nand his command of brilliant epigrammatic phrase.' --Duff. Nothing, for\r\ninstance, could surpass his picture of the fall of Sejanus (Sat. x.\r\n56-97). His power of coining phrases is seen in these _sententiae_:\r\n_nemo repente fuit turpissimus--expende Hannibalem_: _quot libras in\r\nduce summo | invenies_: _maxima debetur puero reverentia_: _mens sana in\r\ncorpora sano_--which are familiar proverbs among educated men.\r\n\r\nJuvenal tells us that he takes all life, all the world, for his text:\r\n\r\n  _Quidquid agunt homines, Votum, Timor, Ira, Voluptas,\r\n  Gaudia, Discursus, nostri est farrago libelli_\r\n      (the motley subject of my page).--_Sat._ i. 85-6.\r\n\r\n\r\nTITUS LIVIUS PATAVINUS, circ. 59 B.C.-17 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIVY.]\r\n\r\nLivy was born at Patavium (_Padua_) between the years 59 and 57 B.C.\r\nLittle is known of his life, but his aristocratic sympathies, as seen in\r\nhis writings, seem to suggest that he was of good family. Padua was a\r\npopulous and busy place, where opportunities for public speaking were\r\nabundant and the public life vigorous; thus Livy was early trained in\r\neloquence, and lived amid scenes of human activity. About 30 B.C. he\r\nsettled at Rome, where his literary talents secured the patronage and\r\nfriendship of Augustus. But though a courtier he was no flatterer.\r\n'Titus Livius,' says Tacitus (_Ann._ iv. 34), 'pre-eminently famous for\r\neloquence and truthfulness, extolled Cn. Pompeius in such a panegyric\r\nthat Augustus called him Pompeianus, and yet this was no obstacle to\r\ntheir friendship.' He returned to his native town before his death, 17\r\nA.D., at the age of about 75.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+History of Rome+ (_Ab urbe condita Libri_), a comprehensive account in\r\n142 Books of the whole History of Rome from the foundation of the City\r\nto the death of Drusus, 9 A.D. It is probable that he intended to\r\ncontinue his work in 150 Books, down to the death of Augustus in 14\r\nA.D., the point from which Tacitus starts. The number of Books now\r\nextant is 35, about one fourth of the whole number, but we possess\r\nsummaries (_Periochae_ or _Argumenta_) of nearly the whole work. The\r\ndivision of the History into decades (sets of ten Books), though merely\r\nconventional, is convenient. According to this arrangement the Books now\r\nextant are:\r\n\r\nBooks I-X, 754-293 B.C., to nearly the close of the Third Samnite War.\r\n\r\nBooks XXI-XXX, 219-201 B.C., the narrative of the Second Punic War.\r\n\r\nBooks XXXI-XLV, 201-167 B.C., describe the Wars in Greece and Macedonia,\r\nand end with the triumph of Aemilius Paulus after Pydna, 168 B.C.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\nHis style is characterised by variety, liveliness, and picturesqueness.\r\n'As a master of style Livy is in the first rank of historians. He marks\r\nthe highest point which the enlarged and enriched prose of the Augustan\r\nage reached just before it began to fall into decadence. . . . The\r\nperiodic structure of Latin prose, which had been developed by Cicero,\r\nis carried by him to an even greater complexity and used with a greater\r\ndaring and freedom. . . . His imagination never fails to kindle at great\r\nactions; it is he, more than any other author, who has impressed the\r\ngreat soldiers and statesmen of the Republic on the imagination of the\r\nworld.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n4. The Speeches.\r\n\r\n'The spirit in which he writes History is well illustrated by the\r\nSpeeches. These, in a way, set the tone of the whole work. He does not\r\naffect in them to reproduce the substance of words actually spoken, or\r\neven to imitate the colour of the time in which the speech is laid. He\r\nuses them rather as a vivid and dramatic method of portraying character\r\nand motive.' --Mackail. 'Everything,' says Quintilian (X. i. 101), 'is\r\nperfectly adapted both to the circumstances and personages introduced.'\r\n\r\n5.  The Purpose of his History.\r\n\r\nThe first ten books of Livy were being written about the same time as\r\nthe _Aeneid_; both Vergil and Livy had the same patriotic purpose, 'to\r\ncelebrate the growth, in accordance with a divine dispensation, of the\r\nRoman Empire and Roman civilisation.' --Nettleship. Livy, however,\r\nbrought into greater prominence the moral causes which contributed to\r\nthe growth of the Empire. In his preface to Book I, § 9, he asks his\r\nreaders to consider _what have been the life and habits of the Romans,\r\nby aid of what men and by what talents at home and in the field their\r\nEmpire has been gained and extended_. Only by virtue and manliness,\r\njustice and piety, was the dominion of the world achieved.\r\n\r\n'In ancient Rome he sees his ideal realised, and _romanus_ hence\r\nsignifies in his language all that is noble. He thus involuntarily\r\nappears partial to Rome, and unjust to her enemies, notably to the\r\nSamnites and Hannibal.' --Teuffel.\r\n\r\n'As the title of _Gesta Populi Romani_ was given to the _Aeneid_ on its\r\nappearance, so the _Historiae ab Urbe Condita_ might be called, with no\r\nless truth, a funeral eulogy--_consummatio totius vitae et quasi\r\nfunebris laudatio_ (Sen. _Suas._ VI. 21)--delivered, by the most loving\r\nand most eloquent of her sons, over the grave of the great Republic.'\r\n--Mackail.\r\n\r\n\r\nM.

Lucan compelled to die.\r\n\r\nLucan was a nephew of M. Annaeus Novatus (the Gallio of Acts xviii.\r\n12-17), and of Seneca, the philosopher and tutor of Nero. 'Rhetoric and\r\nStoic dogma were the staple of his mental training. For a much-petted,\r\nquick-witted youth, plunged into such a society as that of Rome in the\r\nfirst century A.D., hardly any training could be more mischievous.\r\nPuffed up with presumed merits and the applause of the lecture-room and\r\nthe _salon_, he became a shallow rhetorician, devoted to phrase-making\r\nand tinsel ornament, and ready to write and declaim on any subject in\r\nverse or prose at the shortest notice.' --Heitland. Silenced by Nero, in\r\nan enforced retirement--probably in the stately gardens spoken of by\r\nJuvenal vii. 79-80 _contentus fama iaceat Lucanus in hortis\r\nMarmoreis--Lucan may repose in his park adorned with statues and find\r\nfame enough_--he brooded over his wrongs, and despairing of any other\r\nway of restoration to public life, joined the ill-fated conspiracy of\r\nPiso.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nThe +Pharsalia+ (or _De Bello Civili_), an epic poem in ten Books, from\r\nthe beginning of the Civil War down to the point where Caesar is\r\nbesieged in Alexandria, 49-48 B.C. His narrative thus runs parallel to\r\nCaesar's De _Bello Civili_, but it contains some valuable additional\r\nmatter and gives a faithful picture of the feeling general among the\r\nnobility of the day.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\n'To Lucan's rhetorical instincts and training, and the influence of the\r\nrecitations which Juvenal _Sat._ iii. tells us were so customary and\r\nsuch a nuisance in his day, are due the great defects of the\r\n_Pharsalia_. We see the sacrifice of the whole to the parts, neglect of\r\nthe matter in an over-studious regard for the manner, a self-conscious\r\ntone appealing rather to an audience than to a reader, venting itself in\r\napostrophes, digressions, hyperbole (over-drawn description), episodes\r\nand epigrams, an unhappy laboriousness that strains itself to be\r\nfirst-rate for a moment, but leaves the poem second-rate for ever.'\r\n--Heitland.\r\n\r\nThe general effect of Lucan's verse is one of steady monotony, due to a\r\nwant of variety in the pauses and in the ending of lines, and a too\r\nsparing use of elision, by which Vergil was able to regulate the\r\nmovement of lines and make sound and sense agree.\r\n\r\n'In spite of its immaturity and bad taste the poem compels admiration by\r\nits elevation of thought and sustained brilliance of execution; it\r\ncontains passages of lofty thought and real beauty, such as the dream of\r\nPompeius, or the character which Cato gives of Pompeius, and is full of\r\nquotations which have become household words; such as, _In se magna\r\nruunt--Stat magni nominis umbra--Nil actum reputans si quid superesset\r\nagendum_ (a line which rivals Caesar's energy).'--Mackail.\r\n\r\nThe brief and balanced judgment of Quintilian (_Inst. Orat._ X. i. 90)\r\nsums up Lucan in words which suggest at once his chief merits and\r\ndefects as a poet: _Lucanus ardens et concitatus et sententiis\r\nclarissimus et magis oratoribus quam poetis imitandus--Lucan has fire\r\nand point, is very famous for his maxims, and indeed is rather a model\r\nfor orators than poets_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAIUS LUCILIUS, circ. 170-103 B.C.\r\n\r\n1.  Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LUCILIUS.]\r\n\r\nLucilius was born in the Latin town of Suessa of the Aurunci, in\r\nCampania, of a well-to-do equestrian family. Velleius tells us that the\r\nsister of Lucilius was grandmother to Pompeius, and that Lucilius served\r\nin the cavalry under Scipio in the Numantine war, 134 B.C. Lucilius\r\nlived on very intimate terms with Scipio Africanus Minor and Laelius,\r\nand died at Naples (103 B.C.), where he was honoured with a public\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+Saturae+ in thirty Books, in various metres. Fragments only are extant.\r\n\r\n'After Terence he is the most distinguished and the most important in\r\nhis literary influence among the friends of Scipio. The form of\r\nliterature which he invented and popularised, that of familiar poetry,\r\nwas one which proved singularly suited to the Latin genius. He speaks of\r\nhis own works under the name of _Sermones_ (talks)--a name which was\r\nretained by his great successor and imitator Horace; but the peculiar\r\ncombination of metrical form with wide range of subject and the\r\npedestrian style of ordinary prose received in popular usage the name\r\n_Satura_ (mixture).'--Mackail.\r\n\r\n_Satura quidem tota nostra est, in qua primus insignem laudem adeptus\r\nLucilius._ --Quint. X. i. 93.\r\n\r\n'The chief social vices which Lucilius attacks are those which reappear\r\nin the pages of the later satirists. They are the two extremes to which\r\nthe Roman temperament was most prone: rapacity and meanness in gaining\r\nmoney, vulgar ostentation and coarse sensuality in using it.' --Sellar.\r\n\r\nJuvenal says of him (_Sat._ i. 165-7):\r\n\r\n'When old Lucilius seems to draw his sword and growls in burning ire,\r\nthe hearer blushes for shame, his conscience is chilled for his\r\noffences, and his heart faints for secret sins.'\r\n\r\n\r\nT. LUCRETIUS CARUS, circ. 99-55 B.C.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LUCRETIUS.]\r\n\r\nVery little is known of his life. The subiect of his poem prevented him\r\nfrom telling his own history as Catullus, Horace, and Ovid have done,\r\nand his contemporaries seldom refer to him. The name Lucretius suggests\r\nthat he was descended from one of the most ancient patrician houses of\r\nRome, famous in the early annals of the Republic. He was evidently a man\r\nof wealth and position, but he deliberately chose the life of\r\ncontemplation, and lived apart from the ambitions and follies of his\r\nday. Donatus, in his life of Vergil, tells us that Lucretius died on the\r\nday on which Vergil assumed the _toga virilis_, Oct. 15, 55 B.C.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nThe +De Rerum Natura+, a didactic poem in hexameter verse in six Books.\r\nThe poem was left unfinished at his death, and Munro supports the\r\ntradition that Cicero both corrected it and superintended its\r\npublication. The object of the poem is to deliver men from the fear of\r\ndeath and the terrors of superstition by the new knowledge of Nature:\r\n\r\n  _Hunc igitur terrorem animi tenebrasque necessest\r\n  Non radii solis neque lucida tela diei\r\n  Discutiant, sed naturae species ratioque._\r\n\r\n_This terror of the soul, therefore, and this darkness must be\r\ndispelled, not by the rays of the sun or the bright shafts of day, but\r\nby the outward aspect and harmonious plan of nature._ --S.\r\n\r\nThe source of these terrors is traced to the general ignorance of\r\ncertain facts in Nature--ignorance, namely, of the constitution and\r\ncondition of our minds and bodies, of the means by which the world came\r\ninto existence and is still maintained, and, lastly, of the causes of\r\nmany natural phenomena. Thus:\r\n\r\nBooks I and II uphold the principles of the Atomic Theory as held by\r\nEpicurus (_fl._ 300 B.C.).\r\n\r\nBook I states that the world consists of atoms and void. At line 694 is\r\nstated the important doctrine that the evidence of the senses alone is\r\nto be believed--_sensus, unde omnia credita pendent, the senses on which\r\nrests all our belief_.\r\n\r\nBook II treats of the _motions_ of atoms, including the curious doctrine\r\nof the _swerve_, which enables them to combine and makes freedom of will\r\npossible: then of their _shapes_ and _arrangement_.\r\n\r\nBook III shows the nature of mind (_animus_) and life (_anima_) to be\r\nmaterial and therefore mortal. Therefore death is nothing to us:\r\n\r\n  _Nil igitur mors est ad nos neque pertinet hilum,\r\n  Quandoquidem natura animi mortalis habetur.\r\n  Death therefore to us is nothing, concerns us not a jot,\r\n  Since the nature of the mind is proved to be mortal._ --(M.)\r\n\r\nBook IV gives Lucretius' theory of vision and the nature of dreams and\r\napparitions.\r\n\r\nBook V explains the origin of the heavens, of the earth, of vegetable\r\nand animal life upon it, and the advance of human nature from a savage\r\nstate to the arts and usages of civilisation.\r\n\r\nBook VI describes and accounts for certain natural\r\nphenomena--thunderstorms, tempests, volcanoes, earthquakes, and the\r\nlike. It concludes with a theory of disease, illustrated by a fine\r\ndescription of the plague at Athens.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyrrell says: 'It is interesting to point to places in which\r\nLucretius or his predecessors had really anticipated modern scientific\r\nresearch. Thus Lucretius recognises that in a vacuum every body, no\r\nmatter what its weight, falls with equal swiftness; the circulation of\r\nthe sap in the vegetable world is known to him, and he describes falling\r\nstars, aerolites, etc., as the unused material of the universe.' The\r\ngreat truth that matter is not destroyed but only changes its form is\r\nvery clearly stated by Lucretius, and his account (Book V) of the\r\nbeginnings of life upon the earth, the evolution of man, and the\r\nprogress of human society is interesting and valuable.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\n'Notwithstanding the antique tinge (e.g. his use of archaism, assonance,\r\nand alliteration) which for poetical ends he has given to his poem, the\r\nbest judges have always looked upon it as one of the purest models of\r\nthe Latin idiom in the age of its greatest perfection.' --Munro.\r\n\r\n'The language of Lucretius, so bold, so genial, so powerful, and in its\r\nway so perfect.' --Nettleship.\r\n\r\n  _Carmina sublimis tunc sunt peritura Lucreti,\r\n    Exitio terras cum dabit una dies._ --Ovid. _Am._ I. xv. 23.\r\n\r\n  'But till this cosmic order everywhere\r\n    Shattered into one earthquake in one day\r\n    Cracks all to pieces ... till that hour\r\n    My golden work shall stand.' --Tennyson, _Lucretius_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCUS MANILIUS, fl. 12 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MANILIUS.]\r\n\r\nNothing is known of his life. That he was not of Roman birth (perhaps a\r\nnative of N. Africa) is probable from the foreign colouring of his\r\nlanguage at the outset, which in the later books becomes more smooth and\r\nfluent from increased practice.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nThe +Astronomica+ in five Books of hexameter verse. The poem should\r\nrather be called Astrology, as Astronomy is treated only in Book I. He\r\nis proud of being the first writer on this subject in Latin literature.\r\nA close study of Lucretius is obvious from several passages: he often\r\nimitates Vergil, and in the legends (e.g. of Perseus and Andromeda)\r\nOvid.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\nHe is not a great poet; but he is a writer of real power both in thought\r\nand style. In his introductions to each Book, and in his digressions, he\r\nshows sincere feeling and poetical ability.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. VALERIUS MARTIALIS, circ. 40-102 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARTIAL.]\r\n\r\nHe was born at Bilbilis in Hispania Tarraconensis (E. Spain), a town\r\nsituated on a rocky height overlooking the R. Salo:\r\n\r\n  _Municipes, Augusta mihi quos Bilbilis acri\r\n    Monte creat, rapidis quem Salo cingit aquis._\r\n\r\n  X. ciii. 1-2.\r\n\r\nHis father gave him a good education, and at the age of twenty-three (63\r\nA.D.) he went to Rome. After living there for thirty-five years,\r\npatronised by Titus and Vespasian, he returned to Bilbilis soon after\r\nthe accession of Trajan (98 A.D.), where he died _circ._ 102 A.D.\r\n\r\nAt Rome he for a time found powerful friends in his great countrymen of\r\nthe house of Seneca (Lucan and Seneca were then at the height of their\r\nfame), and from 79 to 96 (_temp._ Trajan and Domitian) he received the\r\npatronage of the Court, and numbered among his friends Pliny the\r\nYounger, Quintilian, Juvenal, Valerius Flaccus, and Silius Italicus. His\r\ncomplaints of his poverty are incessant. It is true that he lived\r\nthroughout the life of a dependent, but it is probable that Martial was\r\na poor man who contrived to get through a good deal of money, and who\r\nmistook for poverty a capacity for spending more than he could get.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+Epigrammata+ in fourteen Books (Books XIII and XIV, _Xenia_ and\r\n_Apophoreta_, are two collections of inscriptions for presents at the\r\nSaturnalia); also a +Liber Spectaculorum+ on the opening of the grand\r\nFlavian amphitheatre (the Coliseum) begun by Vespasian and completed by\r\nTitus.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\n'Martial did not create the epigram. What he did was to differentiate\r\nthe epigram and elaborate it. Adhering always to what he considered the\r\ntrue type of the literary epigram, consisting of i. the _preface_, or\r\ndescription of the occasion of the epigram, rousing the curiosity to\r\nknow what the poet has to say about it; and, ii. the explanation or\r\ncommentary of the poet, commonly called the _point_--he employed his\r\nvast resources of satire, wit, observation, fancy, and pathos to produce\r\nthe greatest number of varieties of epigram that the type admits\r\nof. . . . What Martial really stands convicted of on his own showing is\r\nof laughing at that which ought to have roused in him shame and\r\nindignation, and of making literary capital out of other men's vices.'\r\n--Stephenson. Among his good points are his candour, his love of nature,\r\nand the loyalty of his friendships.\r\n\r\nPliny says of him: _Audio Valerium Martialem decessisse et moleste fero.\r\nErat homo ingeniosus, acutus, acer, et qui plurimum in scribendo et\r\nsltis haberet et fellis, nec candoris minus--I hear with regret that V.\r\nMartial is dead. He was a man of talent, acuteness, and spirit: with\r\nplenty of wit and gall, and as sincere as he was witty._ --Pliny, _Ep._\r\niii. 21.\r\n\r\n'The greatest epigrammatist of the world, and one of its most\r\ndisagreeable literary characters.' --Merrill.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORNELIUS NEPOS, circ. 100-24 B.C.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NEPOS.]\r\n\r\nNepos was probably born at Ticinium on the R. Padus. He inherited an\r\nample fortune, and was thereby enabled to keep aloof from public life\r\nand to devote himself to literature and to writing works of an\r\nhistorical nature. In earlier life he was one of the circle of Catullus,\r\nwho dedicated a collection of poems to him (Catull. _C._ i.): 'To whom\r\nam I to give my dainty, new-born little volume? To you, Cornelius.' He\r\nwas also a friend and contemporary of Cicero, and after Cicero's death\r\n(43 B.C.) was one of the chief friends of Atticus.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nOf his numerous writings on history, chronology, and grammar we possess\r\nonly a fragment of his +De Viris Illustribus+ (originally in sixteen\r\nBooks), a collection of Roman and foreign biographies. Of this work\r\nthere is extant one complete section, +De Excellentibus Ducibus\r\nExterarum Gentium+, and two lives, those of Atticus and Cato the\r\nYounger, from his +De Historicis Latinis+.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\nNepos is a most untrustworthy historian, and his work possesses little\r\nindependent value. But his style is clear, elegant, and lively, and he\r\ndid much to make Greek learning popular among his fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO, 43 B.C.-18 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OVID.]\r\n\r\nOvid's own writings (espec. _Tr._ IV. x.) supply nearly all the\r\ninformation we possess regarding his life. He was born at Sulmo, a town\r\nin the cold, moist hills of the Peligni, one of the Sabine clans,\r\nsituated near Corfinium, and about ninety miles E. of Rome. He was of an\r\nancient equestrian family, and together with his elder brother received\r\na careful education at Rome, and studied also at Athens. He was trained\r\nfor the Bar, but in spite of his father's remonstrances preferred poetry\r\nto public life. 'An easy fortune, a brilliant wit, an inexhaustible\r\nmemory, and an unfailing social tact soon made him a prominent figure in\r\nsociety; and his genuine love of literature and admiration for genius\r\nmade him the friend of the whole contemporary world of letters.'\r\n--Mackail. Up to his fiftieth year fortune smiled steadily upon Ovid:\r\nhis works were universally popular, and he enjoyed the favour and\r\npatronage of the Emperor himself. But towards the end of 8 A.D. an\r\nimperial edict ordered him to leave Rome on a named day and take up his\r\nresidence at the small barbarous town of Tomi, on the Black Sea, at the\r\nextreme outposts of civilisation. Augustus proved deaf to all entreaties\r\nto recall him, Tiberius remained alike inexorable, and Ovid died of a\r\nbroken heart at the ago of sixty, in the tenth year of his banishment.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n(1) +Amores+, in three Books, poems in elegiac verse, nearly all on\r\nCorinna, who was probably no real person, but only a name around which\r\nOvid grouped his own fancies, and wrote as the poet of a fashionable,\r\npleasure-loving society. The _Mors Psittaci_ is pleasing and the _Mors\r\nTibulli_ is a noble tribute to a brother poet.\r\n\r\n(2) +Heroides+, twenty letters in elegiac verse, feigned to have been\r\nwritten by ladies or chiefs of the heroic age to the absent objects of\r\ntheir love (15-20 are in pairs, e.g. Paris to Helen and Helen to Paris,\r\nand are probably spurious). 'The Letters 1-14 are thoroughly modern:\r\nthey express the feelings and speak the language of refined women in a\r\nrefined age, and all exhibit an artificiality both in the substance and\r\nthe manner of their pleading.' --Sellar.\r\n\r\n(3) +Ars Amatoria+, in elegiac verse in three Books. This is an ironical\r\nform of didactic poetry in which Ovid teaches the art of lying quite as\r\nmuch as the art of loving.\r\n\r\n(4) +Remedia Amoris+, in elegiac verse, while professing to be a\r\nrecantation of the _Ars Amatoria_, shows, if possible, a worse taste.\r\n\r\n(5) +Metamorphoses+, in hexameter verse in fifteen Books, containing\r\nversions of legends on transformations (_mutatae formae_) from Chaos\r\ndown to Caesar's transformation into a star. In some respects this is\r\nhis greatest poem: Ovid himself makes for it as strong a claim to\r\nimmortality as Horace does for his Odes:\r\n\r\n  _Quaque patet domitis Romana potentia terris,\r\n  Ore legar populi perque omnia saecula fama,\r\n  Siquid habent veri vatum praesagia, vivam._\r\n\r\n        _Met._ XV. 877-end.\r\n\r\n'The attractiveness of this work lies in its descriptions; but the\r\nattempt to divest it of the character of a dictionary of mythology by\r\ninterweaving stories, after the fashion of the _Arabian Nights_, is only\r\npartially successful.' --Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n(6) +Fasti+, in elegiac verse in six Books, a poetical calendar of the\r\nRoman year. Each month has a Book allotted to it, and Ovid probably\r\nsketched out Books vii-xii, but his exile made it impossible for him to\r\ncomplete the work. It contains much valuable information on Roman\r\ncustoms and some exquisitely told stories (_e.g._ the Rape of\r\nProserpine), but leaves the impression of being an effort to produce on\r\nthe reader the effect of a patriotism which the writer did not feel.\r\n\r\n(7) +Poems Written in Exile.+\r\n\r\n  (i) +Tristia+, in elegiac verse in five Books: letters to Augustus,\r\n  to Ovid's wife (for whom he had a deep affection) and to friends,\r\n  praying for pardon or for a place of exile nearer Rome.\r\n\r\n  (ii) +Epistulae ex Ponto+: similar to the _Tristia_.\r\n\r\n'These poems are a melancholy record of flagging vitality and failing\r\npowers.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\nThe real importance of Ovid in literature and his gift to posterity lay\r\nin the new and vivid life which he imparted to the fables of Greek\r\nmythology. 'No other classical poet has furnished more ideas than Ovid\r\nto the Italian poets and painters of the Renaissance, and to our own\r\npoets--from Chaucer to Pope, who, like Ovid,\r\n\r\n  '\"Lisped in numbers, for the numbers came.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\nAULUS PERSIUS FLACCUS, 34-62 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PERSIUS.]\r\n\r\nHe was born at Volaterrae in Etruria, and was the son of a Roman knight\r\nof wealth and rank. At twelve years of age Persius was removed to Rome,\r\nwhere he placed himself under the guidance of the Stoic Cornutus, who\r\nremained his close friend to the end of his short life. Persius\r\n(_Sat._ v.) touchingly describes his residence with Cornutus, and the\r\ninfluence of this beloved teacher in moulding his character:\r\n\r\n  _Pars tua sit, Cornute, animae, tibi, dulcis amice,\r\n  Ostendisse iuvat:_\r\n\r\n'_My delight is to show you, Cornutus, how large a share of my inmost\r\nbeing is yours, my beloved friend._'--C.\r\n\r\nHe was nearly related to Arria, daughter of that 'true wife' who taught\r\nher husband Paetus how to die (Mart. I. xiii.; Pliny _Epist._ i. 16). In\r\nthe consistent life of Thrasea (the husband of Arria), who was a Cato in\r\njustice and more than a Cato in goodness, Persius had a noble example to\r\nfollow. So during the short span of his life the poet lived and worked,\r\na man of maidenly modesty, an excellent son, brother, and nephew, of\r\nfrugal and moderate habits.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+Saturae+, six Satires in hexameter verse. The first, devoted to an\r\nattack upon the literary style of the day, is the only real Satire: the\r\nother five are declamations or dogmas of the Stoic system (e.g. Sat.\r\nii., on right and wrong prayers to the gods), interspersed with dramatic\r\nscenes. It was to Lucilius that Persius owed the impulse that made him a\r\nwriter of Satire, but his obligations to Horace are paramount. 'He was\r\nwhat would be called a plagiarist, but probably no writer ever borrowed\r\nso much and yet left on the mind so decided an impression of\r\noriginality. Where he draws from his own experience, his portraits have\r\nan imaginative truth, minutely accurate yet highly ideal, which would\r\nentitle them to a distinguished place in any portrait gallery.'\r\n--Nettleship.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\n'The involved and obscure style of much of his work is the style which\r\nhis taste leads him to assume for satiric purposes. He feels that a\r\nclear, straightforward, everyday manner of speech would not suit a\r\nsubject over which the gods themselves might hesitate whether to laugh\r\nor weep. As the poet of Stoicism, using the very words of Vergil, he\r\ncalls upon a benighted race to acquaint itself with the _causes_ of\r\nthings: to an inquiry into the purpose of man's being, the art of\r\nskilful driving in the chariot-race of life, and the ordained position\r\nof each individual in the social system.' --Nettleship.\r\n\r\n'Persius is the sole instance among Roman writers of a philosopher whose\r\nlife was in accordance with the doctrines he professed.' --Cruttwell.\r\n\r\n_Multum et verae gloriae quamvis uno libro Persius meruit._ --Quint.\r\n_Inst. Orat._ X. i. 94.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETRONIUS ARBITER, obiit 66 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PETRONIUS.]\r\n\r\nHe is probably the Petronius of whose life and character Tacitus has\r\ngiven us a brilliant sketch in the _Annals_, xvi. 18. 19. 'His days were\r\npassed,' says Tacitus, 'in sleep, his nights in the duties or pleasures\r\nof life: where others toiled for fame he had lounged into it. Yet, as\r\ngovernor of Bithynia, and afterwards as consul, he showed himself a\r\nvigorous and capable administrator; then relapsing into the habit or\r\nassuming the mask of vice, he was adopted as +Elegantiae Arbiter+ (_the\r\nauthority on taste_) into the small circle of Nero's intimate\r\ncompanions. No luxury was charming or refined till Petronius had given\r\nit his approval, and the jealousy of Tigellinus was roused against a\r\nrival and master in the science of pleasure.' Petronius anticipated his\r\ninevitable fate by committing suicide.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+Satirae+ (or +Satiricon+), a character-novel, often called, from its\r\ncentral and most entertaining incident, _The Supper of Trimalchio_.\r\n'This is the description of a Christmas dinner-party given by a sort of\r\nGolden Dustman and his wife, people of low birth and little education,\r\nwho had come into an enormous fortune. The dinner itself, and the\r\nconversation on literature and art that goes on at the dinner-table, are\r\nconceived in a spirit of the wildest humour.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest of the _Satiricon_ for us is the glimpse which it\r\naffords of everyday manners and conversation under the Empire among all\r\norders of society, from the highest to the lowest.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHAEDRUS (_temp._ Augustus to Nero).\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHAEDRUS.]\r\n\r\nThe Latin Fabulist, of whom we know nothing except what may be gathered\r\nor inferred from his fables. He was originally a slave, and was born in\r\nThrace, possibly in the district of Pieria. He was brought to Rome at an\r\nearly age, and there became acquainted with Roman literature. His patron\r\nappears to have been Augustus, who gave him his freedom. After\r\npublishing two books of fables he incurred the resentment of Augustus\r\nand was imprisoned. This was due probably to the bold outspokenness of\r\nmany of his fables. He survived the attacks made on him, and Book V was\r\nwritten in his old age.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+Fables+, in five Books, written in _iambic senarii_, like those of\r\nTerence and Publius Syrus. The full title of his work is _Phaedri\r\nAugusti liberti fabularum Aesopiarum libri_. 'Phaedrus constantly plumes\r\nhimself on his superiority to his model Aesop, but his animals have not\r\nthe lifelike reality of those of the latter.

MACCIUS PLAUTUS, circ. 254-184 B.C.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLAUTUS.]\r\n\r\nPlautus was born in the little Umbrian town of Sarsina, of free but poor\r\nparents. He came to Rome and made a small fortune as a stage-carpenter,\r\nbut lost it by rash investment. He was then reduced to working for some\r\nyears in a corn-mill, during which time he wrote plays, and continued to\r\ndo so until his death.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+Comedies.+ About 130 plays were current under the name of Plautus, but\r\nonly 21 (_Fabulae Varronianae_) were, as Varro tells us, universally\r\nadmitted to be genuine. Of these, all except one are extant.\r\n\r\nThough his comedies are mainly free versions of Greek originals--of\r\nPhilemon, Diphilus and Menander, the writers of the New Comedy 320-250\r\nB.C.--the characters in them act, speak, and joke like genuine Romans,\r\nand he thereby secured the sympatliy of his audience more completely\r\nthan Terence could ever have done.\r\n\r\n'In point of language his plays form one of the most important documents\r\nfor the history of the Latin language. In the freedom with which he\r\nuses, without vulgarising, popular modes of speech, he has no equal\r\namong Latin writers.' --Sellar.\r\n\r\nFor Horace's unfavourable judgment of Plautus see _Epist._ I. i.\r\n170-176, and A. P. 270-272; Cicero's criticism is more just: _Duplex\r\nomnino est iocandi genus: unum illiberale petulans flagitiosum obscenum\r\n(vulgar, spiteful, shameful, coarse), alterum elegans urbanum ingeniosum\r\nfacetum (in good taste, gracious, clever, witty). Quo genere non modo\r\nPlautus noster et Atticorum antiqua comoedia_ (i.e. of Aristophanes),\r\n_sed etiam philosophorum Socraticorum libri referti sunt_. --_De Off._\r\nI. civ.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAIUS PLINIUS SECUNDUS, 23-79 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLINY THE ELDER.]\r\n\r\nBorn at Comum (_Como_) in the middle of the reign of Tiberius, Pliny\r\npassed his life in high public employments, both military and civil,\r\nwhich took him successively over nearly all the provinces of the Empire.\r\nHe had always felt a strong interest in science, and he used his\r\nmilitary position to secure information that otherwise might have been\r\nhard to obtain. Vespasian (70-78 A.D.), with whom he was on terms of\r\nclose intimacy, made him admiral of the fleet stationed at Misenum. It\r\nwas while here that news was brought him of the memorable eruption of\r\nVesuvius in 79 A.D. 'In his zeal for scientific investigation he set\r\nsail for the spot in a man-of-war, and lingering too near the zone of\r\nthe eruption was suffocated by the rain of hot ashes. The account of his\r\ndeath, given by his nephew, Pliny the Younger, in a letter to the\r\nhistorian Tacitus (_Ep._ vi. 16), is one of the best known passages in\r\nthe classics.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nA +Natural History+, in thirty-seven Books, is Pliny's only extant work.\r\n(For his numerous other writings see Pliny the Younger, _Ep._ iii. 5.)\r\n'It is a priceless storehouse of information on every branch of natural\r\nscience as known to the ancient world.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\nHis work has been called the first popular encyclopedia of natural\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n_Plinius Aetatis Suae Doctissimus._ --Gellius.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. PLINIUS CAECILIUS SECUNDUS, 62-113 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLINY THE YOUNGER.]\r\n\r\nPliny the Younger was the son of C. Caecilius and of Plinia, the sister\r\nof the elder Pliny. He was born at Comum (_Como_), also the birthplace\r\nof his celebrated uncle. His father died when he was eight years old,\r\nand he was placed under the care of a guardian, Verginius Rufus, one of\r\nthe most distinguished Romans of the day, since he had held the crown\r\nwithin his grasp and had declined to wear it, 68 A.D. Verginius was not\r\nmuch of a student, but Pliny learned from him high ideals of duty and\r\nnoble thoughts about the Rome of earlier days, and never lost his\r\nunbounded admiration and respect for his guardian (_Ep._ ii. 1). Under\r\nhis uncle's watchful care he received the best education Rome could\r\ngive, and studied rhetoric under the great Quintilian. His bachelor\r\nuncle on his death in 79 left him his heir, adopting him in his will.\r\nGifted with wealth, enthusiasm, taste for publicity, and a wide circle\r\nof influential friends, Pliny could not be content with the career of a\r\nsimple _eques_. Accordingly he began the course of office that led to\r\nthe Senate and the Consulship, and finally in 111 A.D. was appointed by\r\nTrajan governor of Bithynia, where he discharged his duties with skill\r\nand ability. His service seems to have been terminated only with his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+Epistulae+, Letters in nine Books, to which is added Pliny's\r\ncorrespondence with Trajan during his governorship of Bithynia. These\r\nand his +Panegyricus+, in praise of Trajan, are his only extant works.\r\n\r\nIt is on his Letters that Pliny's fame now rests, and both in tone and\r\nstyle they are a monument that does him honour. In many cases they were\r\nwritten for publication, and thus can never have the unique and\r\nsurpassing interest that belongs to those of Cicero, but they give a\r\nvaried and interesting picture of the time. 'In the Letters the\r\ncharacter of the writer, its virtues and its weakness, is throughout\r\nunmistakeable. Pliny, the patriotic citizen,--Pliny, the munificent\r\npatron,--Pliny, the eminent man of letters,--Pliny, the affectionate\r\nhusband and humane master,--Pliny, the man of principle, is in his\r\nvarious phases the real subject of the whole collection.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n'Pliny is an almost perfect type of a refined pagan gentleman.'\r\n--Cruttwell.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEXTUS PROPERTIUS, circ. 50-15 B.C.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROPERTIUS.]\r\n\r\nOf his life little or nothing is known, except what is recorded by\r\nhimself. He was an Umbrian by birth, and probably a native of Asisium\r\n(_Assisi_), a town on the W. slope of the Apennines, not far from\r\nPerusia. Like Vergil and Tibullus, he lost his family property in the\r\nconfiscation of lands by the Triumvirs in 42 B.C.; but his mother's\r\nefforts secured for him a good education, to complete which she brought\r\nhim to Rome. He entered on a course of training for the Bar, but\r\nabandoned it in favour of poetry (IV. i. 131-4).\r\n\r\n  _Mox ubi bulla rudi dimissa est aurea collo,\r\n    Matris et ante deos libera sumpta toga,\r\n  Tum tibi pauca suo de carmine dictat Apollo\r\n    Et vetat insano verba tonare foro._\r\n\r\nHis earliest poems (Book I, _Cynthia_), published at the age of about\r\ntwenty, brought him into notice and gained him admission to the literary\r\ncircle of Maecenas. He lived in close intimacy with Vergil, Ovid, and\r\nmost of his other literary contemporaries, with the remarkable exception\r\nof Horace, to whom the sensitive vanity and passionate manner of the\r\nyoung elegiac poet were alike distasteful. He died young, before he was\r\nthirty-five, about 15 B.C.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+Elegies+, in four Books. (Some editors divide Book II into two Books,\r\nEl. 1-9 Book II, and El. 10-34 Book III, so that III and IV of the MSS.\r\nand of Postgate become IV and V.)\r\n\r\nBooks I and II are nearly all poems on Cynthia.\r\n\r\nBook III contains, besides poems on Cynthia, themes dealing with\r\nfriendship (El. 7. 12. 22) and events of national interest (El. 4. 11.\r\n18). The poet struggles to emancipate himself from the thraldom of\r\nCynthia and to accomplish work more worthy of his genius.\r\n\r\nBook IV contains poems on Roman antiquities (El. 2. 4. 9. 10), written\r\nat the suggestion of Maecenas, the paean on the great victory at Actium\r\n(El. 6), and the noblest of his elegiacs, the Elegy on Cornelia\r\n(El. 11).\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\nThe aim of Propertius was to be the Roman Callimachus: +Umbria Romani\r\npatria Callimachi+ (IV. i. 64).\r\n\r\nThe flexibility and elasticity of rhythm of the finest Greek elegiacs he\r\nmade his own. The pentameter, instead of being a weaker echo of the\r\nhexameter, is the stronger line of the two, and has a weightier\r\nmovement. In Book I he ends the pentameter freely with words of three,\r\nfour, and five syllables, and we find long continuous passages in which\r\nthere is scarcely any pause: e.g. in I. xx. 33-37:\r\n\r\n  _Hic erat Arganthi Pege sub vertice montis\r\n    Grata domus Nymphis umida Thyniasin,\r\n  Quam supra nullae pendebant debita curae\r\n    Roscida desertis poma sub arboribus,\r\n  Et circum irriguo surgebant lilia prato\r\n    Candida purpureis mixta papaveribus._\r\n\r\n'In some respects both Tibullus and Ovid may claim the advantage over\r\nPropertius: Tibullus for refined simplicity, for natural grace and\r\nexquisiteness of touch; Ovid for the technical merits of execution, for\r\ntransparency of construction, for smoothness and polish of expression.\r\nBut in all the higher qualities of a poet Propertius is as much their\r\nsuperior.' --Postgate.\r\n\r\n\r\nAURELIUS PRUDENTIUS CLEMENS, 348-circ. 410 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRUDENTIUS.]\r\n\r\nPrudentius (as he tells us in the brief metrical autobiography prefixed\r\nto his poems) was born in the N. of Spain, and, like so many of the\r\nRoman poets, began his public life as an advocate. He was afterwards\r\nappointed by Theodosius (379-395 A.D.) judge over a district in Spain.\r\nHis active and successful discharge of this office induced Theodosius\r\n(or Honorius, 395-423 A.D.) to promote him to some post of honour about\r\nthe Emperor's person. His later years he devoted to the composition of\r\nsacred poetry, and published his collected works 405 A.D., after which\r\ndate we know no more of his history.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nHis best known works are his +Cathemerina+, a series of poems on the\r\nChristian's day and life, of which the most graceful and pathetic is the\r\n_Funeral Hymn_, e.g.\r\n\r\n    _Iam maesta quiesce querella,\r\n  Lacrimas suspendite matres,\r\n  Nullus sua pignora plangat,\r\n  Mors haec reparatio vitae est_,\r\n\r\nand his +Peristephanon+ (#peri stephanôn# _liber_) in praise of\r\nChristian martyrs. 'These represent the most substantial addition\r\nto Latin lyrical poetry since Horace.' --Mackail. We also have his\r\n+Contra Symmachum+ in two Books of indifferent hexameter verse, in\r\nwhich he combats Symmachus (Consul 391 A.D.), the last champion of\r\nthe old faith, and claims the victories of the Christian Stilicho as\r\ntriumphs alike of Rome and of the Cross.\r\n\r\n'Prudentius has his distinct place and office in the field of Latin\r\nliterature, as the chief author who bridged the gulf between pagan\r\npoetry and Christian hymnology.' --North Pinder.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCUS FABIUS QUINTILIANUS, circ. 35-95 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: QUINTILIAN.]\r\n\r\nQuintilian is the last and perhaps the most distinguished of that school\r\nof Spanish writers (Martial, the two Senecas, and Lucan) which played so\r\nimportant a part in the literary history of the first century. Born at\r\nCalagurris, a small town on the Upper Ebro, he was educated at Rome, and\r\nafterwards returned to his native town as a teacher of rhetoric. There\r\nhe made the acquaintance of the proconsul Galba (68-9), and was brought\r\nback by him to Rome in 68 A.D., where for twenty years he enjoyed the\r\nhighest reputation as a teacher of eloquence. Among his pupils were\r\nnumbered Pliny the Younger and the two sons of Flavius Clemens,\r\ngrand-nephews of Domitian, destined for his successors. In 79 A.D. he\r\nwas appointed by Vespasian professor of rhetoric, the first teacher who\r\nreceived a regular salary from the imperial exchequer. Domitian (81-96\r\nA.D.) conferred upon him an honorary consulship, and the last ten years\r\nof his life were spent in an honoured retirement, which he devoted to\r\nrecording for the benefit of posterity his unrivalled experience as a\r\nteacher of rhetoric.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+Institutio Oratoria+, the _Training of an Orator_, in twelve Books.\r\nThis great work sums up the teaching and criticism of his life, and\r\ngives us the complete training of an orator, starting with him in\r\nchildhood and leading him on to perfection.\r\n\r\nThus:--\r\n\r\nBook I gives a sketch of the elementary training of the child from the\r\ntime he leaves the nursery. Quintilian rightly attaches the greatest\r\nimportance to early impressions.\r\n\r\nBook II deals with the general principles and scope of the art of\r\noratory, and continues the discussion of the aims and methods of\r\neducation in its later stages.\r\n\r\nBooks III-VII are occupied with an exhaustive treatment of the _matter_\r\nof oratory, and are highly technical. 'Now that the formal study of the\r\nart of rhetoric has ceased to be a part of the higher education these\r\nBooks have lost their general interest.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\nBooks VIII-XI treat of the _manner_ (style) of oratory. In Book X, cap.\r\ni, in the course of an enumeration of the Greek and Latin authors likely\r\nto be most useful to an orator, Quintilian gives us a masterly sketch of\r\nLatin literature, 'in language so careful and so choice that many of his\r\nbrief phrases have remained the final words on the authors, both in\r\nprose and verse, whom he mentions in his rapid survey.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\nBook XII treats of the moral qualifications of a great speaker. The good\r\norator must be a good man.\r\n\r\n'Quintilian with admirable clearness insists on the great truth that bad\r\neducation is responsible for bad life, and expresses with equal\r\nplainness the complementary truth that education, from the cradle\r\nupwards, is something which acts on the whole intellectual and moral\r\nnature, and that its object is the production of the _good man_.'\r\n--Mackail.\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\nThe style of Quintilian is modelled on that of Cicero, whom he is never\r\ntired of praising, and is intended to be a return to the usages of the\r\nbest period. In spite of some faults characteristic of the Silver Age\r\n(e.g. his excessive use of antithesis) 'for ordinary use it would be\r\ndifficult to name a manner that combines so well the Ciceronian dignity\r\nwith the rich colour and high finish added to Latin prose by the writers\r\nof the earlier empire.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\nFor the death of his son, aged ten, a boy of great promise, for whose\r\ninstruction he wrote the work, see Preface to Book VI.\r\n\r\n  _Quintiliane, vagae moderator summe iuventae,\r\n  Gloria Romanae, Quintiliane, togae._\r\n\r\nMart.

Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SALLUST.]\r\n\r\nA member of a plebeian family, Sallust was born 86 B.C. at Amiternum, in\r\nthe country of the Sabines. As tribune of the people in 52 B.C. he took\r\nan active part in opposing Milo (Cicero's client) and the Pompeian party\r\nin general. In 48 B.C. he commanded a legion in Illyria without\r\ndistinction, and next year Caesar sent him to treat with the mutinous\r\nlegions in Campania, where he narrowly escaped assassination. He\r\nafterwards followed Caesar to Africa, and apparently did good service\r\nthere, for he was appointed in 46 the first governor of the newly formed\r\nprovince of Numidia. In 45 he returned to Rome a very rich man, and\r\nbuilt himself a magnificent palace, surrounded by pleasure grounds (the\r\nfamous Gardens of Sallust, in the valley between the Quirinal and the\r\nPincius), which in after years emperors preferred to the palace of the\r\nCaesars. After Caesar's death Sallust retired from public life, and it\r\nis to the leisure and study of these ten years that we owe the works\r\nthat have made him famous.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n(1) +De Catilinae Coniuratione+ (or _Bellum Catilinae_), a monograph on\r\nthe famous conspiracy, in which Sallust writes very largely from direct\r\npersonal knowledge of men and events.\r\n\r\n(2) +Bellum Iugurthinum+ (111-106 B.C.) The writing of this monograph\r\ninvolved wide inquiry and much preparation.\r\n\r\n(3) +Historiae+, in five books, dealing with the events from 78 B.C.\r\n(death of Sulla) to 67 B.C., of which only a few fragments are extant.\r\n\r\n3.  Style.\r\n\r\n'Sallust aimed at making historical writing a branch of literature. He\r\nfelt that nothing had yet been done by any Roman writer which would\r\nstand beside Thucydides. It was his ambition to supply the want. That\r\ncould only be done by offering as complete a contrast to the tedious\r\nannalist as possible, and Sallust neglected no means of giving variety\r\nto his work. From Thucydides he probably borrowed the idea of his\r\nintroductions, the imaginary speeches and the character portraits; from\r\nCato the picturesque descriptions of the scenes of historical events and\r\nthe ethnographical digressions.' --Cook.\r\n\r\n'The style of Sallust is characterised by the use of old words and forms\r\n(especially in the speeches). He makes use of alliteration, extensively\r\nemploys the Historic Infinitive, and shows a partiality for\r\nconversational expressions which from a literary point of view are\r\narchaic. His abrupt unperiodic style of writing (rough periods without\r\nparticles of connexion) has won for Sallust his reputation for brevity.\r\nHis style is, however, the expression of the writer's character, direct,\r\nincisive, emphatic, and outspoken; to have been a model for Tacitus is\r\nno slight merit.' --Cook.\r\n\r\n  _Nec minus noto Sallustius epigrammate incessitur:_\r\n          'Et verba antiqui multum furate Catonis,\r\n             Crispe, Iugurthinae conditor historiae.'\r\n\r\n  Quint. VIII. iii. 29.\r\n\r\n'The last of the Ciceronians, Sallust is also in a sense the first of\r\nthe imperial prose-writers.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n_Primus Romana Crispus in Historia_ (Mart. XIV. cxci.)\r\n\r\n\r\nL. ANNAEUS SENECA THE YOUNGER, circ. 4 B.C.-65 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SENECA.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Seneca the Elder, the famous rhetorician, was born at Corduba\r\n(_Cordova_), in Spain, and brought to Rome by his parents at an early\r\nage. His life was one of singularly dramatic contrasts and vicissitudes.\r\nUnder his mother Helvia's watchful care he received the best education\r\nRome could give. Through the influence of his mother's family he passed\r\ninto the Senate through the quaestorship, and his successes at the bar\r\nawakened the jealousy of Caligula (37-41 A.D.) By his father's advice he\r\nretired for a time and spent his days in philosophy. On the accession of\r\nClaudius (41-54 A.D.) he was banished to Corsica at the instance of the\r\nEmpress Messalina, probably because he was suspected of belonging to the\r\nfaction of Agrippina, the mother of Nero. After eight years he was\r\nrecalled (49 A.D.) by the influence of Agrippina (now the wife of\r\nClaudius), and appointed tutor to her son Nero, then a boy of ten. When\r\nNero became emperor, at the age of seventeen (54 A.D.), Seneca, in\r\nconjunction with his friend Burrus, the prefect of the praetorian\r\nguards, became practically the administrator of the Empire. 'The mild\r\nand enlightened administration of the earlier years of the new reign,\r\nthe famous _quinquennium Neronis_, may indeed be largely ascribed to\r\nSeneca's influence; but this influence was based on an excessive\r\nindulgence of Nero's caprices, which soon worked out its own\r\npunishment.' --Mackail. His connivance at the murder of Agrippina (59\r\nA.D.) was the death-blow to his influence for good, and the death of\r\nBurrus (63 A.D.) was, as Tacitus says (_Ann._ xiv. 52), 'a blow to\r\nSeneca's power, for virtue had not the same strength when one of its\r\nchampions, so to speak, was removed, and Nero began to lean on worse\r\nadvisers.' Seneca resolved to retire, and entreated Nero to receive back\r\nthe wealth he had so lavishly bestowed. The Emperor, bent on vengeance,\r\nrefused the proffered gift, and Seneca knew that his doom was sealed. In\r\nthe year 65, on the pretext of complicity in the conspiracy of Piso, he\r\nwas commanded to commit suicide, and Tacitus (_Ann._ xv. 61-63) has\r\nshown his love for Seneca, in spite of all his faults, by the tribute he\r\npays to the constancy of his death.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nHis chief works are:--\r\n\r\n(1) +Dialogorum Libri XII+, of which the most important are the +De Ira+\r\nand the +Consolatio+ to his mother Helvia, whom he tenderly loved.\r\n\r\n(2) +De Clementia+, in three Books, addressed to Nero, written in 55-6\r\nA.D., to show the public what sort of instruction Seneca had given his\r\npupil, and what sort of Emperor they had to expect.\r\n\r\n(3) +De Beneficiis+, in seven Books. Seneca proves that a tyrant's\r\nbenefits are not kindnesses, and sets forth his views on the giving and\r\nreceiving of benefits.\r\n\r\n(4) +Epistulae morales ad Lucilium.+ 124 letters are extant, and form\r\nthe most important and most pleasing of his works.\r\n\r\n(5) +Tragedies.+ Nine are extant, derived from plays by Sophocles and\r\nEuripides. The only extant Latin tragedies.\r\n\r\n'As a moral writer Seneca stands deservedly high. Though infected with\r\nthe rhetorical vices of the age his treatises are full of striking and\r\noften gorgeous eloquence, and in their combination of high thought with\r\ndeep feeling have rarely, if at all, been surpassed.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n'Seneca is a lamentable instance of variance between precept and\r\nexample.' --Cruttwell.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILIUS ITALICUS, circ. 25-100 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SILIUS.]\r\n\r\nA letter of Pliny (iii. 7) is the chief source of our knowledge of the\r\nlife of Silius. Pliny tells us that Silius had risen by acting as a\r\n_delator_ (informer) under Nero, who made him consul 68 A.D. He goes on\r\nto say 'He had gained much credit by his proconsulship in Asia (under\r\nVespasian, _circ._ 77 A.D.), and had since by an honourable leisure\r\nwiped out the blot which stained the activity of his former years.'\r\nMartial also, who has the effrontery to speak of him as a combined\r\nVergil and Cicero, tells us of his luxurious and learned retirement in\r\nCampania, and of his reverence for his master Vergil, 'whose birthday he\r\nkept more religiously than his own.' According to Martial (xi. 49) the\r\ntomb of Vergil had been practically forgotten, and was in the possession\r\nof some poor man when Silius bought the plot of ground on which it\r\nstood:\r\n\r\n  _Iam prope desertos cineres et sancta Maronis\r\n    Nomina qui coleret, pauper et unus erat.\r\n  Silius optatae succurrere censuit umbrae,\r\n    Silius et vatem, non minor ipse, colit._\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nThe +Punica+, an Epic poem in seventeen Books, on the Second Punic War,\r\ncloses with Scipio's triumph, after the Battle of Zama, 202 B.C.\r\n\r\nSilius closely followed the history as told by Livy, and without any\r\ninventive or constructive power of his own copies, with tasteless\r\npedantry, Homer and Vergil. 'He cannot perceive that the divine\r\ninterventions which are admissible in the quarrel of Aeneas and Turnus\r\nare ludicrous when imported into the struggle between Scipio and\r\nHannibal. Who can help resenting the unreality when at Saguntum Jupiter\r\nguides an arrow into Hannibal's body, which Juno immediately withdraws,\r\nor when, at Cannae, Aeolus yields to the prayer of Juno and blinds the\r\nRomans by a whirlwind of dust?'--Cruttwell.\r\n\r\nThe _Punica_ is valuable for its historical accuracy, but it is one of\r\nthe longest and one of the worst Epic poems ever written.\r\n\r\n_Scribebat carmina maiore cura quam ingenio._\r\n\r\n  Pliny, _Epist._ iii. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. PAPINIUS STATIUS, circ. 60-100 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STATIUS.]\r\n\r\nStatius was born at Naples, but early removed to Rome, where he was\r\ncarefully educated and spent the greater part of his life. His father\r\nwas a scholar, rhetorician, and poet of some distinction, and acted for\r\na time as tutor to Domitian. Statius had thus access to the Court, and\r\nrepaid the patronage of Domitian by incessant and shameless flattery.\r\nAfter the completion of his +Thebais+ he retired to Naples, which was\r\nendeared to him by its associations with Vergil, and there satisfied his\r\nreal love of nature.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n(1) The +Thebais+, an Epic poem in twelve Books, on the strife between\r\nthe brothers Eteocles and Polynices, and the subsequent history of\r\nThebes to the death of Creon.\r\n\r\nThe Thebaid became very famous: Juvenal (_Sat._ vii. 82-4) tells us\r\n\r\n  _Curritur ad vocem iucundam et carmen amicae\r\n  Thebaidos, laetam cum fecit Statius urbem\r\n  promisitque diem_ (i.e. for a public recitation of his poem).\r\n\r\n'Its smooth versification, copious diction, and sustained elegance made\r\nit a sort of canon of poetical technique. Among much tedious rhetoric\r\nand cumbrous mythology there is enough imagination and pathos to make\r\nthe poem interesting and even charming.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n(2) The +Silvae+, in five Books, are occasional poems, descriptive and\r\nlyrical, on miscellaneous subjects. These may well be considered his\r\nmasterpiece. 'Genuine poetry,' says Niebuhr, 'imprinted with the\r\ncharacter of the true poet, and constituting some of the most graceful\r\nproductions of Roman literature.'\r\n\r\nAmong the best known are the touching poem to his wife Claudia (iii. 5),\r\nthe marriage song to his brother-poet Arruntius Stella (i. 2), the\r\n_Propempticon Maecio Celeri_ (iii. 2), the _Epicedion_ (funeral song) on\r\nthe death of his adopted son (v. 5), and the short poem (v. 4) on Sleep.\r\n\r\nThe greatest poet of the Decline.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAIUS SUETONIUS TRANQUILLUS, circ. 75-160 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUETONIUS.]\r\n\r\nThe little we know of his life is chiefly gathered from the Letters of\r\nPliny the Younger, and from scattered allusions in his own works. The\r\nson of an officer of the Thirteenth Legion, Suetonius in early life\r\npractised as an advocate, and subsequently became one of Hadrian's\r\nprivate secretaries (_magister epistularum_), but was dismissed from\r\noffice in 121 A.D. After his retirement from the service of the Court he\r\ndevoted the rest of his long life to literary research and compilation,\r\nand published a number of works on a great variety of subjects, so that\r\nhe became famous as the Varro of the imperial period.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nHis extant works are:\r\n\r\n(1) +De Vita Caesarum+, the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, in eight Books\r\n(I-VI Julius-Nero; VII Galba, Otho, and Vitellius; VIII Vespasian,\r\nTitus, and Domitian). This is his most interesting and most valuable\r\nwork. His Lives are not works of art: he is simply a gatherer of facts,\r\ncollected from good sources with considerable care and judgment. 'He\r\nfollows out with absolute faithfulness his own theory, which makes it\r\nnecessary to omit no possible detail that can throw light upon the\r\npersonality of his subject.' --Peck.\r\n\r\n(2) +De Viris Illustribus+, a history of Latin literature up to his day.\r\nThe greater part of the section +De grammaticis et rhetoribus+ is\r\nextant, as well as the Lives of Terence, Horace, and Lucan (partly),\r\nfrom the section +De poetis+, and fragments of the Life of Pliny the\r\nElder from the section +De historicis+.\r\n\r\nExtracts made from this work by Jerome (_circ._ 400 A.D.) in his Latin\r\nversion of Eusebius' Chronicles are the source from which much of our\r\ninformation as to Latin authors is derived.\r\n\r\n'Suetonius is terse, and in that respect he resembles Tacitus; he is\r\ndeeply interesting, and there he shows some likeness to Livy; but his\r\nstyle is one of his own creation. His chief desire is to present the\r\nfacts stripped of any comment whatever, grouped in such a way as to\r\nproduce their own effect without the adventitious aid of rhetoric; and\r\nthen to leave the reader to his own conclusions.' --Peck.\r\n\r\n_Probissimus, honestissimus, eruditissimus vir._\r\n\r\n  Pliny, _Epist. ad Trai._ 94.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLILIUS SYRUS, circ. 45 B.C.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SYRUS.]\r\n\r\nAll we know of him is that he was an enfranchised Syrian slave, a native\r\nof Antioch, and wrote for the stage _mimes_ (farces) which were\r\nperformed with great applause. Mime-writing was also practised at this\r\ntime by the Knight Laberius, and Caesar is said to have patronised these\r\nwriters in the hope of elevating their art.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+Sententiae+ (_Maxims_). We possess 697 lines from his mimes\r\n(unconnected and alphabetically arranged), a collection made in the\r\nearly Middle Ages, and much used in schools. As proverbs of worldly\r\nwisdom, and admirable examples of the terse vigour of Roman philosophy,\r\nthey are widely known, e.g.\r\n\r\n_Cuivis potest accidere quod cuiquam potest._\r\n\r\n\r\nCORNELIUS TACITUS, circ. 54-120 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TACITUS.]\r\n\r\nThe personal history of Tacitus is known to us only from allusions in\r\nhis own works, and from the letters of his friend the younger Pliny. He\r\nwas born early in the reign of Nero, probably in Rome; his education,\r\npolitical career, and marriage into the distinguished family of Agricola\r\nprove that he was a man of wealth and position. He studied rhetoric\r\nunder the best masters (possibly under Quintilian), and had, as Pliny\r\ntells us (_Epist._ II. i. 6), a great reputation as a speaker. He passed\r\nthrough the usual stages of an official career and was appointed _consul\r\nsuffectus_ under Trajan, 98 A.D., when he was a little over forty. From\r\n89 to 93 A.D. he was absent from Rome, probably in some provincial\r\ncommand, and during these years he may have acquired some personal\r\nknowledge of the German peoples. In 100 A.D. he was associated with\r\nPliny in the prosecution for extortion of Marius Priscus, proconsul of\r\nAfrica, of whom Juvenal says (_Sat._ viii. 120):\r\n\r\n_Cum tenues nuper Marius discinxerit Afros._\r\n\r\n_Since Marius has so lately stripped to their girdles_ (i.e. thoroughly\r\nplundered) _the needy Africans_.\r\n\r\nFrom this date Tacitus seems to have devoted himself entirely to\r\nliterary pursuits and to have lived to or beyond the end of Trajan's\r\nreign, 116 A.D.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n(1) +Dialogus de Oratoribus+, an inquiry into the causes of the decay of\r\noratory, his earliest extant work. In the style of this work the\r\ninfluence of Quintilian and Cicero is strongly seen.\r\n\r\n(2) +De Vita et Moribus Iulii Agricolae liber+, an account of the life\r\nof his father-in-law, particularly of his career in Britain, published\r\nshortly after the accession of Trajan, 98 A.D. 'The Sallustian epoch of\r\nTacitus finds its expression in the _Agricola_ and _Germania_.'\r\n--Teuffel.\r\n\r\nThe _Agricola_ is perhaps the most beautiful biography in ancient\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n(3) The +Germania+, or _Concerning the Geography, the Manners and\r\nCustoms, and the Tribes of Germany_, published in 98 or 99. 'The motive\r\nfor its publication was apparently the pressing importance, in Tacitus'\r\nopinion, of the \"German question,\" and the necessity for vigorous action\r\nto secure the safety of the Roman Empire against the dangers with which.\r\nit was threatened from German strength.' --Stephenson.\r\n\r\n'The +Germania+ is an inestimable treasury of facts and generalisations,\r\nand of the general faithfulness of the outline we have no doubt.'\r\n--Stubbs.\r\n\r\n(4) +Historiae+, consisting originally of fourteen Books, is a narrative\r\nof the events of the reigns of Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus,\r\nand Domitian, 69-96 A.D. Only Books I-IV and the first half of Book V\r\nare extant, and give the history of 69 and most of 70 A.D.\r\n\r\n'The style of the _Historiae_ still retains some traces of the influence\r\nof Cicero: it has not yet been pressed tight into the short _sententiae_\r\nwhich were its final and most characteristic development, but shows in a\r\nmarked degree the influence of Vergil.' --Cruttwell.\r\n\r\nIn the _Historiae_, as Tacitus himself says, 'the secret of the imperial\r\nsystem was divulged--that an emperor could be made elsewhere than at\r\nRome'; or, in other words, that the imperial system was a military and\r\nnot a civil institution.\r\n\r\n(5) The +Annales, ab excessu divi Augusti+, in sixteen Books, containing\r\nthe history of the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, 14-68\r\nA.D. There are extant only Books I-IV, parts of V and VI, and XI-XVI.\r\n\r\n'The old criticism, tracing the characteristics of the style of Tacitus\r\nto poetic colouring (almost wholly Vergilian) and to the study of\r\nbrevity and of variety, is well founded. They may be explained by the\r\nfact that he was the most finished pleader of an age which required\r\nabove all that its orators should be terse, brilliant, and striking, and\r\nby his own painful consciousness of the dull monotony and repulsive\r\nsadness of great part of his subject, which needed the help of every\r\nsort of variety to stimulate the flagging interest of the reader.'\r\n--Furneaux.\r\n\r\nHis aim as an historian is best given in his own words: 'I hold it the\r\nchief office of history to rescue virtue from oblivion, and to hold out\r\nthe reprobation of posterity as a terror to evil words and deeds'\r\n(_Ann._ iii. 65).\r\n\r\nThe greatest of Roman historians.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS TERENTIUS AFER, circ. 185-159 B.C.\r\n\r\n1. Life\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TERENCE.]\r\n\r\nTerence was born probably at Carthage, reached Rome as a slave-boy, and\r\npassed there into the possession of a rich and educated Senator, P.\r\nTerentius Lucanus, by whom he was educated and manumitted, taking from\r\nhim the name of Publius Terentius the African. 'A small literary circle\r\nof the Roman aristocracy admitted young Terence to their intimate\r\ncompanionship; and soon he was widely known as making a third in the\r\nfriendship of Gaius Laelius with the first citizen of the Republic, the\r\nyounger Scipio Africanus. Six plays had been subjected to the criticism\r\nof this informal academy of letters and produced on the stage, when\r\nTerence undertook a prolonged visit to Greece for the purpose of further\r\nstudy. He died of fever in the next year, 159 B.C., at the early age of\r\ntwenty-six.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+Comedies.+--All the six plays written and exhibited at Rome by Terence\r\nare extant. They are the _Andria_ (exhibited 166 B.C., when the poet was\r\nonly eighteen years of age), the _Heauton Timoroumenos_, _Eunuchus_,\r\n_Phormio_, _Hecyra_, _Adelphoe_.\r\n\r\n'With Terence Roman literature takes a new departure. The Scipionic\r\ncircle believed that the best way to create a national Latin literature\r\nwas to deviate as little as possible, in spirit, form, and substance,\r\nfrom the works of Greek genius. The task which awaited Terence was the\r\ncomplete Hellenising of Roman comedy: accordingly his aim was to give a\r\ntrue picture of Greek life and manners in the purest Latin style. He was\r\nnot a popular poet, in the sense in which Plautus was popular: he has\r\nnone of the purely Roman characteristics of Plautus in sentiment,\r\nallusion, or style; none of his extravagance, and none of his vigour and\r\noriginality.' --Sellar. Terence is, accordingly, in substance and form,\r\nas Caesar styles him, a _dimidiatus Menander (halved Menander)_:\r\n\r\n  _Tu quoque, tu in summis, o dimidiate Menander,\r\n  Poneris, et merito, puri sermonis amator._\r\n\r\nA Roman only in language, but as _puri sermonis amator_ worthy to be\r\nranked by the side of Caesar himself and the purest Latin authors.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBIUS TIBULLUS, circ. 54-19 B.C.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TIBULLUS.]\r\n\r\nTibullus was a Roman _eques_, and was probably born at Pedum, a Latin\r\ntown just at the foot of the Apennines, and a few miles north of\r\nPraeneste, where his father possessed an ample estate. Much of his\r\ninherited property was lost; and it is possible that, like Vergil,\r\nHorace, and Propertius, he was a victim to the confiscations of the\r\nTriumvirs in 42 B.C. He, however, retained or recovered enough to afford\r\nhim a modest competence. In 31-30 B.C. he served on the staff of his\r\nlife-long friend and patron M. Valerius Messalla, the eminent general\r\nand statesman, not less distinguished in literature than in politics.\r\nThe rest of his short life the poet spent on his ancestral farm at\r\nPedum, amid the country scenes and employments congenial to his nature\r\nand habits.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+Elegies+, in four Books (or three, Postgate). Tibullus published in his\r\nlifetime two Books of elegiac poems: after his death a third volume was\r\npublished, containing a few of his own poems, together with poems by\r\nother members of the literary circle of Messalla. Books I and II consist\r\nmainly of poems addressed to Delia and to Nemesis (cf. Ov. _Am._ III.\r\nix. 31-32):\r\n\r\n  _Sic Nemesis longum, sic Delia nomen habebunt;\r\n      Altera cura recens, altera primus amor._\r\n\r\nAnd to Messalla, e.g. _El._ I. vii. 55-6:\r\n\r\n  _At tibi succrescat proles, quae facta parentis\r\n      Augeat et circa stet veneranda senem._\r\n\r\n3. Style.\r\n\r\n'Tibullus is pre-eminently Roman in his genius and poetry. He is the\r\nnatural poet of warm, tender, and simple feeling. Neither Greek\r\nmythology nor Alexandrine learning had any attractions for his purely\r\nItalian genius. His language may be limited in range and variety, but it\r\nis terse, clear, simple, and popular. His constructions are plain and\r\ndirect.' --North Pinder.\r\n\r\n'To Tibullus belongs the distinction of having given artistic perfection\r\nto the Roman elegy.' --Sellar.\r\n\r\n_Elegia quoque Graecos provocamus, cuius mihi tersus atque elegans\r\nmaxime videtur auctor Tibullus._\r\n\r\n'_In elegy also we rival the Greeks, of which Tibullus appears to me\r\nthe purest and finest representative._' --Quint. _Inst. Or._ X. i. 93.\r\n\r\n'Tibullus might be succinctly and perhaps not unjustly described as a\r\nVergil without the genius.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n'Tibullus and Vergil are alike in their human affection and their piety,\r\nin their capacity of tender and self-forgetful love, in their delight in\r\nthe labours of the field and their sympathy with the herdsman and the\r\nobjects of his care.' --Sellar.\r\n\r\n  _Quid voveat dulci nutricula maius alumno,\r\n  Qui sapere et fari possit quae sentiat, et cui\r\n  Gratia, fama valetudo contingat abunde,\r\n  Et mundus victus, non deficiente crumena!_\r\n\r\n        Horace to Tibullus, _Epist._ I. iv. 8-11.\r\n\r\n  _Si tamen e nobis aliquid nisi nomen et umbra\r\n    Restat, in Elysia valle Tibullus erit._\r\n    .    .    .    .    .\r\n  _Ossa quieta, precor, tuta requiescite in urna,\r\n    Et sit humus cineri non onerosa tuo._\r\n\r\n        Ovid, _Am._ III. ix. 59-60, 67-8.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. VALERIUS FLACCUS, fl. 70 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VALERIUS FLACCUS.]\r\n\r\nHe lived in the reign of Vespasian (70-78 A.D.), to whom he dedicated\r\nhis poem, in which he refers to Vespasian's exploits in Britain and to\r\nthe capture of Jerusalem by Titus, 70 A.D. There are also references to\r\nthe eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D. Quintilian is the only Roman writer\r\nwho mentions him (X. i. 90): _Multum in Valerio Flacco nuper amisimus_,\r\nwhich shows that he must have died _circ._ 90 A.D.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+The Argonautica+, an Hexameter poem in eight Books, apparently\r\nunfinished. The poem is in part a translation, in part a free imitation\r\nof the Alexandrine epic of Apollonius Rhodius (222-181 B.C.) 'His\r\ndescriptive power, particularly shown in touches of natural scenery, his\r\npure diction and correct style have inclined some critics to set\r\nValerius Flaccus above his Greek model.' --North Pinder. The rhetorical\r\ntreatment of the subject, so characteristic of the period of the\r\ndecline, is, however, too prominent throughout his work. Both his rhythm\r\nand language are closely modelled on Vergil.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALERIUS MAXIMUS, fl. 26 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VALERIUS MAXIMUS.]\r\n\r\nAll that we know of him is that he visited Asia in company with Sextus\r\nPompeius (the friend of Ovid and of Germanicus), _circ._ 27-30 A.D.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\n+Facta et Dicta Memorabilia+, in nine Books. Each Book is divided into\r\nchapters on separate subjects (e.g. _De Severitate_, _De Verecundia_,\r\n_De Constantia_), under each of which he gives illustrations from Roman\r\nhistory and from the history of other nations, in order to show the\r\nnative superiority (as he thinks) of Romans to foreigners, and\r\nespecially to Greeks. As an historian he is most untrustworthy, but\r\nthere are many gaps in Roman history (e.g. owing to the lost books of\r\nLivy) which he helps to supply. His style shows all the faults of his\r\nage and rhetorical training; his work was probably intended to be a\r\ncommonplace-book for students and teachers of rhetoric.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. TERENTIUS VARRO, 116-27 B.C.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VARRO.]\r\n\r\nBorn at Reate, in the Sabine territory, which was the nurse of all manly\r\nvirtues, Varro was brought up in the good old-fashioned way. 'For me\r\nwhen a boy,' he says, 'there sufficed a single rough coat and a single\r\nunder-garment, shoes without stockings, a horse without a saddle.' Bold,\r\nfrank, and sarcastic, he had all the qualities of the country gentleman\r\nof the best days of the Republic. On account of his personal valour he\r\nobtained in the war with the Pirates, 67 B.C., where he commanded a\r\ndivision of the fleet, the naval crown. In politics he belonged, as was\r\nnatural, to the constitutional party, and bore an honourable and\r\nenergetic part in its doings and sufferings. On the outbreak of the\r\nCivil War he served as the legatus of Pompeius in command of Further\r\nSpain, but was compelled to surrender his forces to Caesar, 69 B.C. When\r\nthe cause of the Republic was lost Caesar, who knew Varro's worth,\r\nemployed him in superintending the collection and arrangement of the\r\ngreat library at Rome designed for public use. After Caesar's death\r\nVarro was exposed to the persecution of Antonius, whose drunken revels\r\nand excesses at Varro's villa at Casinum are vividly described by Cicero\r\n(_Phil._ ii. 103 sqq.) Through the influence of his many friends Varro\r\nobtained the protection of Octavianus, and was enabled to live at Rome\r\nin peace until his death, 27 B.C., in his ninetieth year.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nOf all the works of Varro, embracing almost all branches of knowledge\r\nand literature, only two have come down to us:\r\n\r\n(1) The +De Re Rustica+, in three Books, in the form of a dialogue,\r\nwritten in his eightieth year. It was a subject of which he had a\r\nthorough practical knowledge, and is the most important of all the\r\ntreatises upon ancient agriculture now extant. Book I treats of\r\nagriculture; Book II of stock-raising; Book III of poultry, game, and\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n(2) +De Lingua Latina+, in twenty-five Books, of which only V-X have\r\nbeen preserved. These contain much valuable information not found\r\nelsewhere, but Varro's notions of etymology are extremely crude.\r\n\r\nOf his other works, we have much cause to regret the loss of his\r\n+Antiquities of Things Human and Divine+, the standard work on the\r\nreligious and secular antiquities of Rome down to the time of Augustus,\r\nand his +Imagines+, biographical sketches, with portraits, of seven\r\nhundred famous Greeks and Romans, the first instance in history of the\r\npublication of an illustrated book.\r\n\r\n'Varro belongs to the genuine type of old Roman, improved but not\r\naltered by Greek learning, with his heart fixed in the past, deeply\r\nconservative of everything national, and even in his style of speech\r\nprotesting against the innovations of the day.' --Cruttwell.\r\n\r\n_Omnium facile acutissimus, et sine ulla dubitatione doctissimus._\r\n--Cicero.\r\n\r\n_Studiosum rerum tantum docet, quantum studiosum verborum Cicero\r\ndelectat._ --St. Augustine.\r\n\r\n\r\nVELLEIUS PATERCULUS, circ. 19 B.C.-31 A.D.\r\n\r\n1. Life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VELLEIUS PATERCULUS.]\r\n\r\nAll we know of him is derived from his own pages. He descended from a\r\ndistinguished family in Campania, and his father was a Praefectus\r\nequitum. He accompanied C. Caesar, the grandson of Augustus, on his\r\nmission to the East, and was present at the interview with the Parthian\r\nking. Two years afterwards, 4 A.D., he served under Tiberius in Germany\r\nas Praefectus equitum. For the next eight years Paterculus served under\r\nTiberius in Pannonia and Dalmatia. Tiberius' sterling qualities as a\r\nsoldier gained him the friendship of many of his officers, and Velleius\r\nby his energy and ability secured that of Tiberius in return. The last\r\ncircumstance of his life that he records is the election to the\r\npraetorship of his brother and himself as candidates of Caesar\r\n(Tiberius) in 14 A.D.\r\n\r\n2. Works.\r\n\r\nThe +Historia Romana+ in two Books. The beginning of Book I is lost;\r\nchapters 1-8 in our text are occupied with a rapid survey of universal\r\nhistory, especially of the East and of Greece. Chapter 8 breaks off at\r\nthe rape of the Sabine women, and there is a great gap in the text\r\nbefore we reach in c. 9 the defeat of Perseus at Pydna in 168 B.C.\r\nChapters 9-13 carry the narrative down to the destruction of Carthage\r\nand Corinth in 146 B.C. Book II continues the history and ends at the\r\ndeath of Livia 27 A.D.\r\n\r\n'The pretentiousness of his style is partly due to the declining taste\r\nof the period, partly to an idea of his own that he could write in the\r\nmanner of Sallust. It alternates between a sort of laboured\r\nsprightliness and a careless, conversational manner full of endless\r\nparentheses. Yet Velleius has two real merits: the eye of a trained\r\nsoldier for character, and an unaffected, if not a very intelligent,\r\ninterest in literature.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.

The language of Lucretius, so bold, so genial, so powerful,\r\nand in its way so perfect, is echoed a thousand times in the Georgics.'\r\n--Nettleship.\r\n\r\nBook I treats of agriculture, Book II of the cultivation of trees, Book\r\nIII of domestic animals, Book IV of bees (including the Myth of\r\nAristaeus, ll. 315-558).\r\n\r\nThe _purpose of the Georgics_ is to ennoble the annual round of labour\r\nin which the rural life was passed and to help the policy of Augustus by\r\ninducing the people to go back to the land.\r\n\r\n'The motto of the Georgics might well be said to be _Ora et labora_.'\r\n--Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n'The Georgics represent the art of Vergil in its matured perfection, and\r\nin mere technical finish are the most perfect work of Latin literature.'\r\n--Mackail.\r\n\r\n(3) The +Aeneid+, in twelve Books, written 29-19 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe _choice of the subject_ was influenced by the wish of Augustus to\r\nestablish the legendary tradition of the connection of the gens Iulia\r\nwith Aeneas through his son Iulus, and by Vergil's own desire to write\r\nan epic on the greatness of Rome, in the manner of Homer. Thus 'the\r\ncentre of the mythical background was naturally Aeneas, as Augustus was\r\nthe centre of the present magnificence of the Roman Empire. _We surpass\r\nall other nations_, says Cicero (_De Nat. Deor._ ii. 8), _in holding\r\nfast the belief that all things are ordered by a Divine Providence_. The\r\ntheme of the _Aeneid_ is the building up of the Roman Empire under this\r\nProvidence. Aeneas is the son of a goddess, and his life the working out\r\nof the divine decrees.' --Nettleship.\r\n\r\n  _Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento;\r\n  Hae tibi erunt artes; pacisque imponere morem._\r\n\r\n  _Aen._ vi. 851-2.\r\n\r\n'At a verse from the _Aeneid_, the sun goes back for us on the dial; our\r\nboyhood is recreated, and returns to us for a moment like a visitant\r\nfrom a happy dreamland.' --Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n'In merely technical quality the supremacy of Vergil's art has never\r\nbeen disputed. The Latin Hexameter, _the stateliest measure ever moulded\r\nby the lips of man_, was brought by him to a perfection which made any\r\nfurther development impossible.' --Mackail.\r\n\r\n'As Homer among the Greeks, so Vergil among our own authors will best\r\nhead the list; he is beyond doubt the second epic poet of either\r\nnation.' --Quint. X. i. 85.\r\n\r\n'The chastest poet and royalest, Vergilius Maro, that to the memory of\r\nman is known.' --Bacon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nThe following Chronological Outlines of Roman History and Literature are\r\nintended to illustrate the passages selected for translation.

English translations retain their _italic_\r\nmarkup.\r\n\r\nIn the Demonstrations, sentence breaks were marked with || in the body\r\ntext corresponding to Roman numerals in the margin. These numerals are\r\nshown _between_ paired lines as |IV|, or in braces {IV} when the lines\r\nwere not used.\r\n\r\nInternal references using page numbers are supplemented in double\r\nbrackets as [[Selection C17]] or [[Introduction 6 (2)]].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Line Numbers_\r\n\r\nReading passages were printed with marginal line numbers starting from\r\n1 at the top of each page. A page might contain one or more selections,\r\nbut readings never crossed page breaks. Line numbers have been variously\r\nhandled:\r\n\r\nAll markings of line 1 were omitted.\r\n\r\nIn the six Demonstrations, line numbers are not used in the explanatory\r\ntext, so they were omitted. In the Miscellaneous Passages, which have no\r\nlinenotes, line numbers were omitted in all prose and in the shorter\r\nverse selections.\r\n\r\nIn prose passages labeled B, C, D, line numbers by multiples of 5 were\r\nprinted in the margin. They are shown here in {braces} within the body\r\ntext. Where a word was split at line break, the number comes after the\r\ncomplete word.\r\n\r\nIn verse passages, lines have been renumbered to match the actual line\r\nnumbers as cited in the text. Selections from the Hallam edition of\r\nOvid's _Fasti_ (see below) are numbered from 1 within each passage.\r\n\r\nAny cross-references containing line numbers have been correspondingly\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Hallam Edition of Ovid's Fasti_\r\n\r\nThis expurgated edition was produced in 1882 for the use of boys at\r\nHarrow. Hallam's Preface says:\r\n\r\n  I have cut out all passages unfit for a boy to read, and renumbered\r\n  all the lines in text and references, and it seemed best not to\r\n  put the old numbering side by side with the new, except in the\r\n  Grammatical Appendices. It has been necessary to alter the text,\r\n  though very slightly, in about six places.\r\n\r\nIn some books, cuts are substantial: ii. 701-710 (reading D5B, page 64)\r\nis 543-552 in Hallam. For this e-text, the original line number is shown\r\nin double brackets after the cited Hallam number; when the original\r\nnumber was used, the Hallam number is shown in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Errata_ (noted by transcriber)\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n  149  A. ...
