It\r\nseems strange that such a labor-saving device should have struggled for\r\nnearly a thousand years after its system of place value was perfected\r\nbefore it replaced such crude notations as the one that the Roman conqueror\r\nmade substantially universal in Europe. Such, however, is the case, and\r\nthere is probably no one who has not at least some slight passing interest\r\nin the story of this struggle. To the mathematician and the student of\r\ncivilization the interest is generally a deep one; to the teacher of the\r\nelements of knowledge the interest may be less marked, but nevertheless it\r\nis real; and even the business man who makes daily use of the curious\r\nsymbols by which we express the numbers of commerce, cannot fail to have\r\nsome appreciation for the story of the rise and progress of these tools of\r\nhis trade.\r\n\r\nThis story has often been told in part, but it is a long time since any\r\neffort has been made to bring together the fragmentary narrations and to\r\nset forth the general problem of the origin and development of these {iv}\r\nnumerals. In this little work we have attempted to state the history of\r\nthese forms in small compass, to place before the student materials for the\r\ninvestigation of the problems involved, and to express as clearly as\r\npossible the results of the labors of scholars who have studied the subject\r\nin different parts of the world. We have had no theory to exploit, for the\r\nhistory of mathematics has seen too much of this tendency already, but as\r\nfar as possible we have weighed the testimony and have set forth what seem\r\nto be the reasonable conclusions from the evidence at hand.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the work of students an index has been prepared which we hope\r\nmay be serviceable. In this the names of authors appear only when some use\r\nhas been made of their opinions or when their works are first mentioned in\r\nfull in a footnote.\r\n\r\nIf this work shall show more clearly the value of our number system, and\r\nshall make the study of mathematics seem more real to the teacher and\r\nstudent, and shall offer material for interesting some pupil more fully in\r\nhis work with numbers, the authors will feel that the considerable labor\r\ninvolved in its preparation has not been in vain.\r\n\r\nWe desire to acknowledge our especial indebtedness to Professor Alexander\r\nZiwet for reading all the proof, as well as for the digest of a Russian\r\nwork, to Professor Clarence L. Meader for Sanskrit transliterations, and to\r\nMr. Steven T. Byington for Arabic transliterations and the scheme of\r\npronunciation of Oriental names, and also our indebtedness to other\r\nscholars in Oriental learning for information.\r\n\r\nDAVID EUGENE SMITH\r\n\r\nLOUIS CHARLES KARPINSKI\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{v}\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER\r\n\r\n        PRONUNCIATION OF ORIENTAL NAMES                              vi\r\n\r\n  I.

(A) like _a_\r\nin _ask_ or in _man_. [=A], as in _father_.\r\n\r\nC, (S) like _ch_ in _church_ (Italian _c_ in _cento_).\r\n\r\n[D.], [N.], [S.], [T.], (S) _d_, _n_, _sh_, _t_, made with the tip of the\r\ntongue turned up and back into the dome of the palate. [D.], [S.], [T.],\r\n[Z.], (A) _d_, _s_, _t_, _z_, made with the tongue spread so that the\r\nsounds are produced largely against the side teeth. Europeans commonly\r\npronounce [D.], [N.], [S.], [T.], [Z.], both (S) and (A), as simple _d_,\r\n_n_, _sh_ (S) or _s_ (A), _t_, _z_. [D=] (A), like _th_ in _this_.\r\n\r\nE, (S) as in _they_. (A) as in _bed_.\r\n\r\n[.G], (A) a voiced consonant formed below the vocal cords; its sound is\r\ncompared by some to a _g_, by others to a guttural _r_; in Arabic words\r\nadopted into English it is represented by _gh_ (e.g. _ghoul_), less often\r\n_r_ (e.g. _razzia_).\r\n\r\nH preceded by _b_, _c_, _t_, _[t.]_, etc. does not form a single sound with\r\nthese letters, but is a more or less distinct _h_ sound following them; cf.\r\nthe sounds in _abhor, boathook_, etc., or, more accurately for (S), the\r\n\"bhoys\" etc. of Irish brogue. H (A) retains its consonant sound at the end\r\nof a word. [H.], (A) an unvoiced consonant formed below the vocal cords;\r\nits sound is sometimes compared to German hard _ch_, and may be represented\r\nby an _h_ as strong as possible. In Arabic words adopted into English it is\r\nrepresented by _h_, e.g. in _sahib_, _hakeem_. [H.] (S) is final consonant\r\n_h_, like final _h_ (A).\r\n\r\nI, as in _pin_. [=I], as in _pique_.\r\n\r\nK, as in _kick_.\r\n\r\nKH, (A) the hard _ch_ of Scotch _loch_, German _ach_, especially of German\r\nas pronounced by the Swiss.\r\n\r\n[.M], [.N], (S) like French final _m_ or _n_, nasalizing the preceding\r\nvowel.\r\n\r\n[N.], see [D.]. Ñ, like _ng_ in _singing_.\r\n\r\nO, (S) as in _so_. (A) as in _obey_.\r\n\r\nQ, (A) like _k_ (or _c_) in _cook_; further back in the mouth than in\r\n_kick_.\r\n\r\nR, (S) English _r_, smooth and untrilled. (A) stronger. [R.], (S) r used as\r\nvowel, as in _apron_ when pronounced _aprn_ and not _apern_; modern Hindus\r\nsay _ri_, hence our _amrita_, _Krishna_, for _a-m[r.]ta, K[r.][s.][n.]a_.\r\n\r\nS, as in _same_. [S.], see [D.]. ['S], (S) English _sh_ (German _sch_).\r\n\r\n[T.], see [D.].\r\n\r\nU, as in _put_. [=U], as in _rule_.\r\n\r\nY, as in _you_.\r\n\r\n[Z.], see [D.].\r\n\r\n`, (A) a sound kindred to the spiritus lenis (that is, to our ears, the\r\nmere distinct separation of a vowel from the preceding sound, as at the\r\nbeginning of a word in German) and to _[h.]_. The ` is a very distinct\r\nsound in Arabic, but is more nearly represented by the spiritus lenis than\r\nby any sound that we can produce without much special training. That is, it\r\nshould be treated as silent, but the sounds that precede and follow it\r\nshould not run together. In Arabic words adopted into English it is treated\r\nas silent, e.g. in _Arab_, _amber_, _Caaba_ (_`Arab_, _`anbar_, _ka`abah_).\r\n\r\n(A) A final long vowel is shortened before _al_ (_'l_) or _ibn_ (whose _i_\r\nis then silent).\r\n\r\nAccent: (S) as if Latin; in determining the place of the accent _[.m]_ and\r\n_[.n]_ count as consonants, but _h_ after another consonant does not. (A),\r\non the last syllable that contains a long vowel or a vowel followed by two\r\nconsonants, except that a final long vowel is not ordinarily accented; if\r\nthere is no long vowel nor two consecutive consonants, the accent falls on\r\nthe first syllable. The words _al_ and _ibn_ are never accented.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{1}\r\n\r\nTHE HINDU-ARABIC NUMERALS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nEARLY IDEAS OF THEIR ORIGIN\r\n\r\nIt has long been recognized that the common numerals used in daily life are\r\nof comparatively recent origin. The number of systems of notation employed\r\nbefore the Christian era was about the same as the number of written\r\nlanguages, and in some cases a single language had several systems. The\r\nEgyptians, for example, had three systems of writing, with a numerical\r\nnotation for each; the Greeks had two well-defined sets of numerals, and\r\nthe Roman symbols for number changed more or less from century to century.\r\nEven to-day the number of methods of expressing numerical concepts is much\r\ngreater than one would believe before making a study of the subject, for\r\nthe idea that our common numerals are universal is far from being correct.\r\nIt will be well, then, to think of the numerals that we still commonly call\r\nArabic, as only one of many systems in use just before the Christian era.\r\nAs it then existed the system was no better than many others, it was of\r\nlate origin, it contained no zero, it was cumbersome and little used, {2}\r\nand it had no particular promise. Not until centuries later did the system\r\nhave any standing in the world of business and science; and had the place\r\nvalue which now characterizes it, and which requires a zero, been worked\r\nout in Greece, we might have been using Greek numerals to-day instead of\r\nthe ones with which we are familiar.\r\n\r\nOf the first number forms that the world used this is not the place to\r\nspeak. Many of them are interesting, but none had much scientific value. In\r\nEurope the invention of notation was generally assigned to the eastern\r\nshores of the Mediterranean until the critical period of about a century\r\nago,--sometimes to the Hebrews, sometimes to the Egyptians, but more often\r\nto the early trading Phoenicians.[1]\r\n\r\nThe idea that our common numerals are Arabic in origin is not an old one.\r\nThe mediæval and Renaissance writers generally recognized them as Indian,\r\nand many of them expressly stated that they were of Hindu origin.[2] {3}\r\nOthers argued that they were probably invented by the Chaldeans or the Jews\r\nbecause they increased in value from right to left, an argument that would\r\napply quite as well to the Roman and Greek systems, or to any other. It\r\nwas, indeed, to the general idea of notation that many of these writers\r\nreferred, as is evident from the words of England's earliest arithmetical\r\ntextbook-maker, Robert Recorde (c. 1542): \"In that thinge all men do agree,\r\nthat the Chaldays, whiche fyrste inuented thys arte, did set these figures\r\nas thei set all their letters. for they wryte backwarde as you tearme it,\r\nand so doo they reade. And that may appeare in all Hebrewe, Chaldaye and\r\nArabike bookes ... where as the Greekes, Latines, and all nations of\r\nEurope, do wryte and reade from the lefte hand towarde the ryghte.\"[3]\r\nOthers, and {4} among them such influential writers as Tartaglia[4] in\r\nItaly and Köbel[5] in Germany, asserted the Arabic origin of the numerals,\r\nwhile still others left the matter undecided[6] or simply dismissed them as\r\n\"barbaric.\"[7] Of course the Arabs themselves never laid claim to the\r\ninvention, always recognizing their indebtedness to the Hindus both for the\r\nnumeral forms and for the distinguishing feature of place value. Foremost\r\namong these writers was the great master of the golden age of Bagdad, one\r\nof the first of the Arab writers to collect the mathematical classics of\r\nboth the East and the West, preserving them and finally passing them on to\r\nawakening Europe. This man was Mo[h.]ammed the Son of Moses, from\r\nKhow[=a]rezm, or, more after the manner of the Arab, Mo[h.]ammed ibn\r\nM[=u]s[=a] al-Khow[=a]razm[=i],[8] a man of great {5} learning and one to\r\nwhom the world is much indebted for its present knowledge of algebra[9] and\r\nof arithmetic. Of him there will often be occasion to speak; and in the\r\narithmetic which he wrote, and of which Adelhard of Bath[10] (c. 1130) may\r\nhave made the translation or paraphrase,[11] he stated distinctly that the\r\nnumerals were due to the Hindus.[12] This is as plainly asserted by later\r\nArab {6} writers, even to the present day.[13] Indeed the phrase _`ilm\r\nhind[=i]_, \"Indian science,\" is used by them for arithmetic, as also the\r\nadjective _hind[=i]_ alone.[14]\r\n\r\nProbably the most striking testimony from Arabic sources is that given by\r\nthe Arabic traveler and scholar Mohammed ibn A[h.]med, Ab[=u]\r\n'l-R[=i][h.][=a]n al-B[=i]r[=u]n[=i] (973-1048), who spent many years in\r\nHindustan. He wrote a large work on India,[15] one on ancient\r\nchronology,[16] the \"Book of the Ciphers,\" unfortunately lost, which\r\ntreated doubtless of the Hindu art of calculating, and was the author of\r\nnumerous other works. Al-B[=i]r[=u]n[=i] was a man of unusual attainments,\r\nbeing versed in Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, Hebrew, and Syriac, as well as\r\nin astronomy, chronology, and mathematics. In his work on India he gives\r\ndetailed information concerning the language and {7} customs of the people\r\nof that country, and states explicitly[17] that the Hindus of his time did\r\nnot use the letters of their alphabet for numerical notation, as the Arabs\r\ndid. He also states that the numeral signs called _a[.n]ka_[18] had\r\ndifferent shapes in various parts of India, as was the case with the\r\nletters. In his _Chronology of Ancient Nations_ he gives the sum of a\r\ngeometric progression and shows how, in order to avoid any possibility of\r\nerror, the number may be expressed in three different systems: with Indian\r\nsymbols, in sexagesimal notation, and by an alphabet system which will be\r\ntouched upon later. He also speaks[19] of \"179, 876, 755, expressed in\r\nIndian ciphers,\" thus again attributing these forms to Hindu sources.\r\n\r\nPreceding Al-B[=i]r[=u]n[=i] there was another Arabic writer of the tenth\r\ncentury, Mo[t.]ahhar ibn [T.][=a]hir,[20] author of the _Book of the\r\nCreation and of History_, who gave as a curiosity, in Indian (N[=a]gar[=i])\r\nsymbols, a large number asserted by the people of India to represent the\r\nduration of the world. Huart feels positive that in Mo[t.]ahhar's time the\r\npresent Arabic symbols had not yet come into use, and that the Indian\r\nsymbols, although known to scholars, were not current. Unless this were the\r\ncase, neither the author nor his readers would have found anything\r\nextraordinary in the appearance of the number which he cites.\r\n\r\nMention should also be made of a widely-traveled student, Al-Mas`[=u]d[=i]\r\n(885?-956), whose journeys carried him from Bagdad to Persia, India,\r\nCeylon, and even {8} across the China sea, and at other times to\r\nMadagascar, Syria, and Palestine.[21] He seems to have neglected no\r\naccessible sources of information, examining also the history of the\r\nPersians, the Hindus, and the Romans. Touching the period of the Caliphs\r\nhis work entitled _Meadows of Gold_ furnishes a most entertaining fund of\r\ninformation. He states[22] that the wise men of India, assembled by the\r\nking, composed the _Sindhind_. Further on[23] he states, upon the authority\r\nof the historian Mo[h.]ammed ibn `Al[=i] `Abd[=i], that by order of\r\nAl-Man[s.][=u]r many works of science and astrology were translated into\r\nArabic, notably the _Sindhind_ (_Siddh[=a]nta_). Concerning the meaning and\r\nspelling of this name there is considerable diversity of opinion.\r\nColebrooke[24] first pointed out the connection between _Siddh[=a]nta_ and\r\n_Sindhind_. He ascribes to the word the meaning \"the revolving ages.\"[25]\r\nSimilar designations are collected by Sédillot,[26] who inclined to the\r\nGreek origin of the sciences commonly attributed to the Hindus.[27]\r\nCasiri,[28] citing the _T[=a]r[=i]kh al-[h.]okam[=a]_ or _Chronicles of the\r\nLearned_,[29] refers to the work {9} as the _Sindum-Indum_ with the meaning\r\n\"perpetuum æternumque.\" The reference[30] in this ancient Arabic work to\r\nAl-Khow[=a]razm[=i] is worthy of note.\r\n\r\nThis _Sindhind_ is the book, says Mas`[=u]d[=i],[31] which gives all that\r\nthe Hindus know of the spheres, the stars, arithmetic,[32] and the other\r\nbranches of science. He mentions also Al-Khow[=a]razm[=i] and [H.]abash[33]\r\nas translators of the tables of the _Sindhind_. Al-B[=i]r[=u]n[=i][34]\r\nrefers to two other translations from a work furnished by a Hindu who came\r\nto Bagdad as a member of the political mission which Sindh sent to the\r\ncaliph Al-Man[s.][=u]r, in the year of the Hejira 154 (A.D. 771).\r\n\r\nThe oldest work, in any sense complete, on the history of Arabic literature\r\nand history is the _Kit[=a]b al-Fihrist_, written in the year 987 A.D., by\r\nIbn Ab[=i] Ya`q[=u]b al-Nad[=i]m. It is of fundamental importance for the\r\nhistory of Arabic culture. Of the ten chief divisions of the work, the\r\nseventh demands attention in this discussion for the reason that its second\r\nsubdivision treats of mathematicians and astronomers.[35]\r\n\r\n{10}\r\n\r\nThe first of the Arabic writers mentioned is Al-Kind[=i] (800-870 A.D.),\r\nwho wrote five books on arithmetic and four books on the use of the Indian\r\nmethod of reckoning. Sened ibn `Al[=i], the Jew, who was converted to Islam\r\nunder the caliph Al-M[=a]m[=u]n, is also given as the author of a work on\r\nthe Hindu method of reckoning. Nevertheless, there is a possibility[36]\r\nthat some of the works ascribed to Sened ibn `Al[=i] are really works of\r\nAl-Khow[=a]razm[=i], whose name immediately precedes his. However, it is to\r\nbe noted in this connection that Casiri[37] also mentions the same writer\r\nas the author of a most celebrated work on arithmetic.\r\n\r\nTo Al-[S.][=u]f[=i], who died in 986 A.D., is also credited a large work on\r\nthe same subject, and similar treatises by other writers are mentioned. We\r\nare therefore forced to the conclusion that the Arabs from the early ninth\r\ncentury on fully recognized the Hindu origin of the new numerals.\r\n\r\nLeonard of Pisa, of whom we shall speak at length in the chapter on the\r\nIntroduction of the Numerals into Europe, wrote his _Liber Abbaci_[38] in\r\n1202. In this work he refers frequently to the nine Indian figures,[39]\r\nthus showing again the general consensus of opinion in the Middle Ages that\r\nthe numerals were of Hindu origin.\r\n\r\nSome interest also attaches to the oldest documents on arithmetic in our\r\nown language. One of the earliest {11} treatises on algorism is a\r\ncommentary[40] on a set of verses called the _Carmen de Algorismo_, written\r\nby Alexander de Villa Dei (Alexandra de Ville-Dieu), a Minorite monk of\r\nabout 1240 A.D. The text of the first few lines is as follows:\r\n\r\n \"Hec algorism' ars p'sens dicit' in qua\r\n  Talib; indor[um] fruim bis quinq; figuris.[41]\r\n\r\n\"This boke is called the boke of algorim or augrym after lewder use. And\r\nthis boke tretys of the Craft of Nombryng, the quych crafte is called also\r\nAlgorym. Ther was a kyng of Inde the quich heyth Algor & he made this\r\ncraft.... Algorisms, in the quych we use teen figurys of Inde.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{12}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEARLY HINDU FORMS WITH NO PLACE VALUE\r\n\r\nWhile it is generally conceded that the scientific development of astronomy\r\namong the Hindus towards the beginning of the Christian era rested upon\r\nGreek[42] or Chinese[43] sources, yet their ancient literature testifies to\r\na high state of civilization, and to a considerable advance in sciences, in\r\nphilosophy, and along literary lines, long before the golden age of Greece.\r\nFrom the earliest times even up to the present day the Hindu has been wont\r\nto put his thought into rhythmic form. The first of this poetry--it well\r\ndeserves this name, being also worthy from a metaphysical point of\r\nview[44]--consists of the Vedas, hymns of praise and poems of worship,\r\ncollected during the Vedic period which dates from approximately 2000 B.C.\r\nto 1400 B.C.[45] Following this work, or possibly contemporary with it, is\r\nthe Brahmanic literature, which is partly ritualistic (the\r\nBr[=a]hma[n.]as), and partly philosophical (the Upanishads). Our especial\r\ninterest is {13} in the S[=u]tras, versified abridgments of the ritual and\r\nof ceremonial rules, which contain considerable geometric material used in\r\nconnection with altar construction, and also numerous examples of rational\r\nnumbers the sum of whose squares is also a square, i.e. \"Pythagorean\r\nnumbers,\" although this was long before Pythagoras lived. Whitney[46]\r\nplaces the whole of the Veda literature, including the Vedas, the\r\nBr[=a]hma[n.]as, and the S[=u]tras, between 1500 B.C. and 800 B.C., thus\r\nagreeing with Bürk[47] who holds that the knowledge of the Pythagorean\r\ntheorem revealed in the S[=u]tras goes back to the eighth century B.C.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the S[=u]tras as showing an independent origin of Hindu\r\ngeometry, contrary to the opinion long held by Cantor[48] of a Greek\r\norigin, has been repeatedly emphasized in recent literature,[49] especially\r\nsince the appearance of the important work of Von Schroeder.[50] Further\r\nfundamental mathematical notions such as the conception of irrationals and\r\nthe use of gnomons, as well as the philosophical doctrine of the\r\ntransmigration of souls,--all of these having long been attributed to the\r\nGreeks,--are shown in these works to be native to India. Although this\r\ndiscussion does not bear directly upon the {14} origin of our numerals, yet\r\nit is highly pertinent as showing the aptitude of the Hindu for\r\nmathematical and mental work, a fact further attested by the independent\r\ndevelopment of the drama and of epic and lyric poetry.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated definitely at the outset, however, that we are not at\r\nall sure that the most ancient forms of the numerals commonly known as\r\nArabic had their origin in India. As will presently be seen, their forms\r\nmay have been suggested by those used in Egypt, or in Eastern Persia, or in\r\nChina, or on the plains of Mesopotamia. We are quite in the dark as to\r\nthese early steps; but as to their development in India, the approximate\r\nperiod of the rise of their essential feature of place value, their\r\nintroduction into the Arab civilization, and their spread to the West, we\r\nhave more or less definite information. When, therefore, we consider the\r\nrise of the numerals in the land of the Sindhu,[51] it must be understood\r\nthat it is only the large movement that is meant, and that there must\r\nfurther be considered the numerous possible sources outside of India itself\r\nand long anterior to the first prominent appearance of the number symbols.\r\n\r\nNo one attempts to examine any detail in the history of ancient India\r\nwithout being struck with the great dearth of reliable material.[52] So\r\nlittle sympathy have the people with any save those of their own caste that\r\na general literature is wholly lacking, and it is only in the observations\r\nof strangers that any all-round view of scientific progress is to be found.\r\nThere is evidence that primary schools {15} existed in earliest times, and\r\nof the seventy-two recognized sciences writing and arithmetic were the most\r\nprized.[53] In the Vedic period, say from 2000 to 1400 B.C., there was the\r\nsame attention to astronomy that was found in the earlier civilizations of\r\nBabylon, China, and Egypt, a fact attested by the Vedas themselves.[54]\r\nSuch advance in science presupposes a fair knowledge of calculation, but of\r\nthe manner of calculating we are quite ignorant and probably always shall\r\nbe. One of the Buddhist sacred books, the _Lalitavistara_, relates that\r\nwhen the B[=o]dhisattva[55] was of age to marry, the father of Gopa, his\r\nintended bride, demanded an examination of the five hundred suitors, the\r\nsubjects including arithmetic, writing, the lute, and archery. Having\r\nvanquished his rivals in all else, he is matched against Arjuna the great\r\narithmetician and is asked to express numbers greater than 100 kotis.[56]\r\nIn reply he gave a scheme of number names as high as 10^{53}, adding that\r\nhe could proceed as far as 10^{421},[57] all of which suggests the system\r\nof Archimedes and the unsettled question of the indebtedness of the West to\r\nthe East in the realm of ancient mathematics.[58] Sir Edwin Arnold, {16} in\r\n_The Light of Asia_, does not mention this part of the contest, but he\r\nspeaks of Buddha's training at the hands of the learned Vi[s.]vamitra:\r\n\r\n  \"And Viswamitra said, 'It is enough,\r\n  Let us to numbers. After me repeat\r\n  Your numeration till we reach the lakh,[59]\r\n  One, two, three, four, to ten, and then by tens\r\n  To hundreds, thousands.' After him the child\r\n  Named digits, decads, centuries, nor paused,\r\n  The round lakh reached, but softly murmured on,\r\n  Then comes the k[=o]ti, nahut, ninnahut,\r\n  Khamba, viskhamba, abab, attata,\r\n  To kumuds, gundhikas, and utpalas,\r\n  By pundar[=i]kas into padumas,\r\n  Which last is how you count the utmost grains\r\n  Of Hastagiri ground to finest dust;[60]\r\n  But beyond that a numeration is,\r\n  The K[=a]tha, used to count the stars of night,\r\n  The K[=o]ti-K[=a]tha, for the ocean drops;\r\n  Ingga, the calculus of circulars;\r\n  Sarvanikchepa, by the which you deal\r\n  With all the sands of Gunga, till we come\r\n  To Antah-Kalpas, where the unit is\r\n  The sands of the ten crore Gungas.  If one seeks\r\n  More comprehensive scale, th' arithmic mounts\r\n  By the Asankya, which is the tale\r\n  Of all the drops that in ten thousand years\r\n  Would fall on all the worlds by daily rain;\r\n  Thence unto Maha Kalpas, by the which\r\n  The gods compute their future and their past.'\"\r\n\r\n{17}\r\n\r\nThereupon Vi[s.]vamitra [=A]c[=a]rya[61] expresses his approval of the\r\ntask, and asks to hear the \"measure of the line\" as far as y[=o]jana, the\r\nlongest measure bearing name. This given, Buddha adds:\r\n\r\n  ... \"'And master! if it please,\r\n  I shall recite how many sun-motes lie\r\n  From end to end within a y[=o]jana.'\r\n  Thereat, with instant skill, the little prince\r\n  Pronounced the total of the atoms true.\r\n  But Viswamitra heard it on his face\r\n  Prostrate before the boy; 'For thou,' he cried,\r\n  'Art Teacher of thy teachers--thou, not I,\r\n  Art G[=u]r[=u].'\"\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that this is far from being history. And yet it puts\r\nin charming rhythm only what the ancient _Lalitavistara_ relates of the\r\nnumber-series of the Buddha's time. While it extends beyond all reason,\r\nnevertheless it reveals a condition that would have been impossible unless\r\narithmetic had attained a considerable degree of advancement.\r\n\r\nTo this pre-Christian period belong also the _Ved[=a][.n]gas_, or \"limbs\r\nfor supporting the Veda,\" part of that great branch of Hindu literature\r\nknown as _Sm[r.]iti_ (recollection), that which was to be handed down by\r\ntradition. Of these the sixth is known as _Jyoti[s.]a_ (astronomy), a short\r\ntreatise of only thirty-six verses, written not earlier than 300 B.C., and\r\naffording us some knowledge of the extent of number work in that\r\nperiod.[62] The Hindus {18} also speak of eighteen ancient Siddh[=a]ntas or\r\nastronomical works, which, though mostly lost, confirm this evidence.[63]\r\n\r\nAs to authentic histories, however, there exist in India none relating to\r\nthe period before the Mohammedan era (622 A.D.). About all that we know of\r\nthe earlier civilization is what we glean from the two great epics, the\r\nMah[=a]bh[=a]rata[64] and the R[=a]m[=a]yana, from coins, and from a few\r\ninscriptions.[65]\r\n\r\nIt is with this unsatisfactory material, then, that we have to deal in\r\nsearching for the early history of the Hindu-Arabic numerals, and the fact\r\nthat many unsolved problems exist and will continue to exist is no longer\r\nstrange when we consider the conditions. It is rather surprising that so\r\nmuch has been discovered within a century, than that we are so uncertain as\r\nto origins and dates and the early spread of the system. The probability\r\nbeing that writing was not introduced into India before the close of the\r\nfourth century B.C., and literature existing only in spoken form prior to\r\nthat period,[66] the number work was doubtless that of all primitive\r\npeoples, palpable, merely a matter of placing sticks or cowries or pebbles\r\non the ground, of marking a sand-covered board, or of cutting notches or\r\ntying cords as is still done in parts of Southern India to-day.[67]\r\n\r\n{19}\r\n\r\nThe early Hindu numerals[68] may be classified into three great groups, (1)\r\nthe Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i], (2) the Br[=a]hm[=i], and (3) the word and letter\r\nforms; and these will be considered in order.\r\n\r\nThe Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i] numerals are found in inscriptions formerly known as\r\nBactrian, Indo-Bactrian, and Aryan, and appearing in ancient Gandh[=a]ra,\r\nnow eastern Afghanistan and northern Punjab. The alphabet of the language\r\nis found in inscriptions dating from the fourth century B.C. to the third\r\ncentury A.D., and from the fact that the words are written from right to\r\nleft it is assumed to be of Semitic origin. No numerals, however, have been\r\nfound in the earliest of these inscriptions, number-names probably having\r\nbeen written out in words as was the custom with many ancient peoples. Not\r\nuntil the time of the powerful King A['s]oka, in the third century B.C., do\r\nnumerals appear in any inscriptions thus far discovered; and then only in\r\nthe primitive form of marks, quite as they would be found in Egypt, Greece,\r\nRome, or in {20} various other parts of the world. These A['s]oka[69]\r\ninscriptions, some thirty in all, are found in widely separated parts of\r\nIndia, often on columns, and are in the various vernaculars that were\r\nfamiliar to the people. Two are in the Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i] characters, and\r\nthe rest in some form of Br[=a]hm[=i]. In the Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i]\r\ninscriptions only four numerals have been found, and these are merely\r\nvertical marks for one, two, four, and five, thus:\r\n\r\n  |     ||     |||     ||||\r\n\r\nIn the so-called ['S]aka inscriptions, possibly of the first century B.C.,\r\nmore numerals are found, and in more highly developed form, the\r\nright-to-left system appearing, together with evidences of three different\r\nscales of counting,--four, ten, and twenty. The numerals of this period are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere are several noteworthy points to be observed in studying this system.\r\nIn the first place, it is probably not as early as that shown in the\r\nN[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t forms hereafter given, although the inscriptions\r\nthemselves at N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t are later than those of the A['s]oka\r\nperiod. The {21} four is to this system what the X was to the Roman,\r\nprobably a canceling of three marks as a workman does to-day for five, or a\r\nlaying of one stick across three others. The ten has never been\r\nsatisfactorily explained. It is similar to the A of the Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i]\r\nalphabet, but we have no knowledge as to why it was chosen. The twenty is\r\nevidently a ligature of two tens, and this in turn suggested a kind of\r\nradix, so that ninety was probably written in a way reminding one of the\r\nquatre-vingt-dix of the French. The hundred is unexplained, although it\r\nresembles the letter _ta_ or _tra_ of the Br[=a]hm[=i] alphabet with 1\r\nbefore (to the right of) it. The two hundred is only a variant of the\r\nsymbol for hundred, with two vertical marks.[70]\r\n\r\nThis system has many points of similarity with the Nabatean numerals[71] in\r\nuse in the first centuries of the Christian era. The cross is here used for\r\nfour, and the Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i] form is employed for twenty. In addition\r\nto this there is a trace of an analogous use of a scale of twenty. While\r\nthe symbol for 100 is quite different, the method of forming the other\r\nhundreds is the same. The correspondence seems to be too marked to be\r\nwholly accidental.\r\n\r\nIt is not in the Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i] numerals, therefore, that we can hope\r\nto find the origin of those used by us, and we turn to the second of the\r\nIndian types, the Br[=a]hm[=i] characters. The alphabet attributed to\r\nBrahm[=a] is the oldest of the several known in India, and was used from\r\nthe earliest historic times. There are various theories of its origin, {22}\r\nnone of which has as yet any wide acceptance,[72] although the problem\r\noffers hope of solution in due time. The numerals are not as old as the\r\nalphabet, or at least they have not as yet been found in inscriptions\r\nearlier than those in which the edicts of A['s]oka appear, some of these\r\nhaving been incised in Br[=a]hm[=i] as well as Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i]. As\r\nalready stated, the older writers probably wrote the numbers in words, as\r\nseems to have been the case in the earliest Pali writings of Ceylon.[73]\r\n\r\nThe following numerals are, as far as known, the only ones to appear in the\r\nA['s]oka edicts:[74]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese fragments from the third century B.C., crude and unsatisfactory as\r\nthey are, are the undoubted early forms from which our present system\r\ndeveloped. They next appear in the second century B.C. in some inscriptions\r\nin the cave on the top of the N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t hill, about seventy-five\r\nmiles from Poona in central India. These inscriptions may be memorials of\r\nthe early Andhra dynasty of southern India, but their chief interest lies\r\nin the numerals which they contain.\r\n\r\nThe cave was made as a resting-place for travelers ascending the hill,\r\nwhich lies on the road from Kaly[=a]na to Junar. It seems to have been cut\r\nout by a descendant {23} of King ['S][=a]tav[=a]hana,[75] for inside the\r\nwall opposite the entrance are representations of the members of his\r\nfamily, much defaced, but with the names still legible. It would seem that\r\nthe excavation was made by order of a king named Vedisiri, and \"the\r\ninscription contains a list of gifts made on the occasion of the\r\nperformance of several _yagnas_ or religious sacrifices,\" and numerals are\r\nto be seen in no less than thirty places.[76]\r\n\r\nThere is considerable dispute as to what numerals are really found in these\r\ninscriptions, owing to the difficulty of deciphering them; but the\r\nfollowing, which have been copied from a rubbing, are probably number\r\nforms:[77]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe inscription itself, so important as containing the earliest\r\nconsiderable Hindu numeral system connected with our own, is of sufficient\r\ninterest to warrant reproducing part of it in facsimile, as is done on page\r\n24.\r\n\r\n{24}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe next very noteworthy evidence of the numerals, and this quite complete\r\nas will be seen, is found in certain other cave inscriptions dating back to\r\nthe first or second century A.D. In these, the Nasik[78] cave inscriptions,\r\nthe forms are as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, until the decimal system finally adopted the first nine\r\ncharacters and replaced the rest of the Br[=a]hm[=i] notation by adding the\r\nzero, the progress of these forms is well marked. It is therefore well to\r\npresent synoptically the best-known specimens that have come down to us,\r\nand this is done in the table on page 25.[79]\r\n\r\n{25}\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE PROGRESS OF NUMBER FORMS IN INDIA\r\n\r\n  NUMERALS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 1000\r\n  A['s]oka[80]                [Illustration]\r\n  ['S]aka[81]                 [Illustration]\r\n  A['s]oka[82]                [Illustration]\r\n  N[=a]gar[=i][83]            [Illustration]\r\n  Nasik[84]                   [Illustration]\r\n  K[s.]atrapa[85]             [Illustration]\r\n  Ku[s.]ana [86]              [Illustration]\r\n  Gupta[87]                   [Illustration]\r\n  Valhab[=i][88]              [Illustration]\r\n  Nepal [89]                  [Illustration]\r\n  Kali[.n]ga[90]              [Illustration]\r\n  V[=a]k[=a][t.]aka[91]       [Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Most of these numerals are given by Bühler, loc. cit., Tafel IX.]\r\n\r\n{26} With respect to these numerals it should first be noted that no zero\r\nappears in the table, and as a matter of fact none existed in any of the\r\ncases cited. It was therefore impossible to have any place value, and the\r\nnumbers like twenty, thirty, and other multiples of ten, one hundred, and\r\nso on, required separate symbols except where they were written out in\r\nwords. The ancient Hindus had no less than twenty of these symbols,[92] a\r\nnumber that was afterward greatly increased. The following are examples of\r\ntheir method of indicating certain numbers between one hundred and one\r\nthousand:\r\n\r\n  [93] [Numerals] for 174\r\n  [94] [Numerals] for 191\r\n  [95] [Numerals] for 269\r\n  [96] [Numerals] for 252\r\n  [97] [Numerals] for 400\r\n  [98] [Numerals] for 356\r\n\r\n{27}\r\n\r\nTo these may be added the following numerals below one hundred, similar to\r\nthose in the table:\r\n\r\n  [Numerals][99]    for 90\r\n  [Numerals][100]   for 70\r\n\r\nWe have thus far spoken of the Kharo[s.][t.]h[=i] and Br[=a]hm[=i]\r\nnumerals, and it remains to mention the third type, the word and letter\r\nforms. These are, however, so closely connected with the perfecting of the\r\nsystem by the invention of the zero that they are more appropriately\r\nconsidered in the next chapter, particularly as they have little relation\r\nto the problem of the origin of the forms known as the Arabic.\r\n\r\nHaving now examined types of the early forms it is appropriate to turn our\r\nattention to the question of their origin. As to the first three there is\r\nno question. The [1 vertical stroke] or [1 horizontal stroke] is simply one\r\nstroke, or one stick laid down by the computer. The [2 vertical strokes] or\r\n[2 horizontal strokes] represents two strokes or two sticks, and so for the\r\n[3 vertical strokes] and [3 horizontal strokes]. From some primitive [2\r\nvertical strokes] came the two of Egypt, of Rome, of early Greece, and of\r\nvarious other civilizations. It appears in the three Egyptian numeral\r\nsystems in the following forms:\r\n\r\n  Hieroglyphic [2 vertical strokes]\r\n  Hieratic     [Hieratic 2]\r\n  Demotic      [Demotic 2]\r\n\r\nThe last of these is merely a cursive form as in the Arabic [Arabic 2],\r\nwhich becomes our 2 if tipped through a right angle. From some primitive [2\r\nhorizontal strokes] came the Chinese {28} symbol, which is practically\r\nidentical with the symbols found commonly in India from 150 B.C. to 700\r\nA.D. In the cursive form it becomes [2 horizontal strokes joined], and this\r\nwas frequently used for two in Germany until the 18th century. It finally\r\nwent into the modern form 2, and the [3 horizontal strokes] in the same way\r\nbecame our 3.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, considerable ground for interesting speculation with\r\nrespect to these first three numerals. The earliest Hindu forms were\r\nperpendicular. In the N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t inscriptions they are vertical.\r\nBut long before either the A['s]oka or the N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t inscriptions\r\nthe Chinese were using the horizontal forms for the first three numerals,\r\nbut a vertical arrangement for four.[101] Now where did China get these\r\nforms? Surely not from India, for she had them, as her monuments and\r\nliterature[102] show, long before the Hindus knew them. The tradition is\r\nthat China brought her civilization around the north of Tibet, from\r\nMongolia, the primitive habitat being Mesopotamia, or possibly the oases of\r\nTurkestan. Now what numerals did Mesopotamia use? The Babylonian system,\r\nsimple in its general principles but very complicated in many of its\r\ndetails, is now well known.[103] In particular, one, two, and three were\r\nrepresented by vertical arrow-heads. Why, then, did the Chinese write {29}\r\ntheirs horizontally? The problem now takes a new interest when we find that\r\nthese Babylonian forms were not the primitive ones of this region, but that\r\nthe early Sumerian forms were horizontal.[104]\r\n\r\nWhat interpretation shall be given to these facts? Shall we say that it was\r\nmere accident that one people wrote \"one\" vertically and that another wrote\r\nit horizontally? This may be the case; but it may also be the case that the\r\ntribal migrations that ended in the Mongol invasion of China started from\r\nthe Euphrates while yet the Sumerian civilization was prominent, or from\r\nsome common source in Turkestan, and that they carried to the East the\r\nprimitive numerals of their ancient home, the first three, these being all\r\nthat the people as a whole knew or needed. It is equally possible that\r\nthese three horizontal forms represent primitive stick-laying, the most\r\nnatural position of a stick placed in front of a calculator being the\r\nhorizontal one. When, however, the cuneiform writing developed more fully,\r\nthe vertical form may have been proved the easier to make, so that by the\r\ntime the migrations to the West began these were in use, and from them came\r\nthe upright forms of Egypt, Greece, Rome, and other Mediterranean lands,\r\nand those of A['s]oka's time in India. After A['s]oka, and perhaps among\r\nthe merchants of earlier centuries, the horizontal forms may have come down\r\ninto India from China, thus giving those of the N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t cave and\r\nof later inscriptions. This is in the realm of speculation, but it is not\r\nimprobable that further epigraphical studies may confirm the hypothesis.\r\n\r\n{30}\r\n\r\nAs to the numerals above three there have been very many conjectures. The\r\nfigure one of the Demotic looks like the one of the Sanskrit, the two\r\n(reversed) like that of the Arabic, the four has some resemblance to that\r\nin the Nasik caves, the five (reversed) to that on the K[s.]atrapa coins,\r\nthe nine to that of the Ku[s.]ana inscriptions, and other points of\r\nsimilarity have been imagined. Some have traced resemblance between the\r\nHieratic five and seven and those of the Indian inscriptions. There have\r\nnot, therefore, been wanting those who asserted an Egyptian origin for\r\nthese numerals.[105] There has already been mentioned the fact that the\r\nKharo[s.][t.]h[=i] numerals were formerly known as Bactrian, Indo-Bactrian,\r\nand Aryan. Cunningham[106] was the first to suggest that these numerals\r\nwere derived from the alphabet of the Bactrian civilization of Eastern\r\nPersia, perhaps a thousand years before our era, and in this he was\r\nsupported by the scholarly work of Sir E. Clive Bayley,[107] who in turn\r\nwas followed by Canon Taylor.[108] The resemblance has not proved\r\nconvincing, however, and Bayley's drawings {31} have been criticized as\r\nbeing affected by his theory. The following is part of the hypothesis:[109]\r\n\r\n  _Numeral_      _Hindu_       _Bactrian_       _Sanskrit_\r\n     4           [Symbol]      [Symbol] = ch    chatur, Lat. quattuor\r\n     5           [Symbol]      [Symbol] = p     pancha, Gk. [Greek:p/ente]\r\n     6           [Symbol]      [Symbol] = s     [s.]a[s.]\r\n     7           [Symbol]      [Symbol] = [s.]  sapta\r\n     ( the s and [s.] are interchanged as occasionally in N. W. India)\r\n\r\nBühler[110] rejects this hypothesis, stating that in four cases (four, six,\r\nseven, and ten) the facts are absolutely against it.\r\n\r\nWhile the relation to ancient Bactrian forms has been generally doubted, it\r\nis agreed that most of the numerals resemble Br[=a]hm[=i] letters, and we\r\nwould naturally expect them to be initials.[111] But, knowing the ancient\r\npronunciation of most of the number names,[112] we find this not to be the\r\ncase. We next fall back upon the hypothesis {32} that they represent the\r\norder of letters[113] in the ancient alphabet. From what we know of this\r\norder, however, there seems also no basis for this assumption. We have,\r\ntherefore, to confess that we are not certain that the numerals were\r\nalphabetic at all, and if they were alphabetic we have no evidence at\r\npresent as to the basis of selection. The later forms may possibly have\r\nbeen alphabetical expressions of certain syllables called _ak[s.]aras_,\r\nwhich possessed in Sanskrit fixed numerical values,[114] but this is\r\nequally uncertain with the rest. Bayley also thought[115] that some of the\r\nforms were Phoenician, as notably the use of a circle for twenty, but the\r\nresemblance is in general too remote to be convincing.\r\n\r\nThere is also some slight possibility that Chinese influence is to be seen\r\nin certain of the early forms of Hindu numerals.[116]\r\n\r\n{33}\r\n\r\nMore absurd is the hypothesis of a Greek origin, supposedly supported by\r\nderivation of the current symbols from the first nine letters of the Greek\r\nalphabet.[117] This difficult feat is accomplished by twisting some of the\r\nletters, cutting off, adding on, and effecting other changes to make the\r\nletters fit the theory. This peculiar theory was first set up by\r\nDasypodius[118] (Conrad Rauhfuss), and was later elaborated by Huet.[119]\r\n\r\n{34}\r\n\r\nA bizarre derivation based upon early Arabic (c. 1040 A.D.) sources is\r\ngiven by Kircher in his work[120] on number mysticism. He quotes from\r\nAbenragel,[121] giving the Arabic and a Latin translation[122] and stating\r\nthat the ordinary Arabic forms are derived from sectors of a circle,\r\n[circle].\r\n\r\nOut of all these conflicting theories, and from all the resemblances seen\r\nor imagined between the numerals of the West and those of the East, what\r\nconclusions are we prepared to draw as the evidence now stands? Probably\r\nnone that is satisfactory. Indeed, upon the evidence at {35} hand we might\r\nproperly feel that everything points to the numerals as being substantially\r\nindigenous to India. And why should this not be the case? If the king\r\nSrong-tsan-Gampo (639 A.D.), the founder of Lh[=a]sa,[123] could have set\r\nabout to devise a new alphabet for Tibet, and if the Siamese, and the\r\nSinghalese, and the Burmese, and other peoples in the East, could have\r\ncreated alphabets of their own, why should not the numerals also have been\r\nfashioned by some temple school, or some king, or some merchant guild? By\r\nway of illustration, there are shown in the table on page 36 certain\r\nsystems of the East, and while a few resemblances are evident, it is also\r\nevident that the creators of each system endeavored to find original forms\r\nthat should not be found in other systems. This, then, would seem to be a\r\nfair interpretation of the evidence. A human mind cannot readily create\r\nsimple forms that are absolutely new; what it fashions will naturally\r\nresemble what other minds have fashioned, or what it has known through\r\nhearsay or through sight. A circle is one of the world's common stock of\r\nfigures, and that it should mean twenty in Phoenicia and in India is hardly\r\nmore surprising than that it signified ten at one time in Babylon.[124] It\r\nis therefore quite probable that an extraneous origin cannot be found for\r\nthe very sufficient reason that none exists.\r\n\r\nOf absolute nonsense about the origin of the symbols which we use much has\r\nbeen written. Conjectures, {36} however, without any historical evidence\r\nfor support, have no place in a serious discussion of the gradual evolution\r\nof the present numeral forms.[125]\r\n\r\n  TABLE OF CERTAIN EASTERN SYSTEMS\r\n  Siam            [Illustration: numerals]\r\n  Burma[126]      [Illustration: numerals]\r\n  Malabar[127]    [Illustration: numerals]\r\n  Tibet[128]      [Illustration: numerals]\r\n  Ceylon[129]     [Illustration: numerals]\r\n  Malayalam[129]  [Illustration: numerals]\r\n\r\n{37}\r\n\r\nWe may summarize this chapter by saying that no one knows what suggested\r\ncertain of the early numeral forms used in India. The origin of some is\r\nevident, but the origin of others will probably never be known. There is no\r\nreason why they should not have been invented by some priest or teacher or\r\nguild, by the order of some king, or as part of the mysticism of some\r\ntemple. Whatever the origin, they were no better than scores of other\r\nancient systems and no better than the present Chinese system when written\r\nwithout the zero, and there would never have been any chance of their\r\ntriumphal progress westward had it not been for this relatively late\r\nsymbol. There could hardly be demanded a stronger proof of the Hindu origin\r\nof the character for zero than this, and to it further reference will be\r\nmade in Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{38}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nLATER HINDU FORMS, WITH A PLACE VALUE\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of the perfected Hindu numerals with the zero and the place\r\nvalue, it is necessary to consider the third system mentioned on page\r\n19,--the word and letter forms. The use of words with place value began at\r\nleast as early as the 6th century of the Christian era. In many of the\r\nmanuals of astronomy and mathematics, and often in other works in\r\nmentioning dates, numbers are represented by the names of certain objects\r\nor ideas. For example, zero is represented by \"the void\" (_['s][=u]nya_),\r\nor \"heaven-space\" (_ambara [=a]k[=a]['s]a_); one by \"stick\" (_rupa_),\r\n\"moon\" (_indu ['s]a['s]in_), \"earth\" (_bh[=u]_), \"beginning\" (_[=a]di_),\r\n\"Brahma,\" or, in general, by anything markedly unique; two by \"the twins\"\r\n(_yama_), \"hands\" (_kara_), \"eyes\" (_nayana_), etc.; four by \"oceans,\" five\r\nby \"senses\" (_vi[s.]aya_) or \"arrows\" (the five arrows of K[=a]mad[=e]va);\r\nsix by \"seasons\" or \"flavors\"; seven by \"mountain\" (_aga_), and so on.[130]\r\nThese names, accommodating themselves to the verse in which scientific\r\nworks were written, had the additional advantage of not admitting, as did\r\nthe figures, easy alteration, since any change would tend to disturb the\r\nmeter.\r\n\r\n{39}\r\n\r\nAs an example of this system, the date \"['S]aka Sa[m.]vat, 867\" (A.D. 945\r\nor 946), is given by \"_giri-ra[s.]a-vasu_,\" meaning \"the mountains\"\r\n(seven), \"the flavors\" (six), and the gods \"_Vasu_\" of which there were\r\neight. In reading the date these are read from right to left.[131] The\r\nperiod of invention of this system is uncertain. The first trace seems to\r\nbe in the _['S]rautas[=u]tra_ of K[=a]ty[=a]yana and\r\nL[=a][t.]y[=a]yana.[132] It was certainly known to Var[=a]ha-Mihira (d.\r\n587),[133] for he used it in the _B[r.]hat-Sa[m.]hit[=a]._[134] It has also\r\nbeen asserted[135] that [=A]ryabha[t.]a (c. 500 A.D.) was familiar with\r\nthis system, but there is nothing to prove the statement.[136] The earliest\r\nepigraphical examples of the system are found in the Bayang (Cambodia)\r\ninscriptions of 604 and 624 A.D.[137]\r\n\r\nMention should also be made, in this connection, of a curious system of\r\nalphabetic numerals that sprang up in southern India. In this we have the\r\nnumerals represented by the letters as given in the following table:\r\n\r\n  1        2       3       4       5        6       7      8     9      0\r\n  k        kh      g       gh      [.n]     c       ch     j     jh     ñ\r\n  [t.]     [t.]h   [d.]    [d.]h   [n.]     t       th     d     th     n\r\n  p        ph      b       bh      m\r\n  y        r       l       v       ['s]     [s.]    s      h      l\r\n\r\n{40}\r\n\r\nBy this plan a numeral might be represented by any one of several letters,\r\nas shown in the preceding table, and thus it could the more easily be\r\nformed into a word for mnemonic purposes. For example, the word\r\n\r\n    2     3      1     5    6       5       1\r\n  _kha_ _gont_ _yan_ _me_ _[s.]a_ _m[=a]_ _pa_\r\n\r\nhas the value 1,565,132, reading from right to left.[138] This, the oldest\r\nspecimen (1184 A.D.) known of this notation, is given in a commentary on\r\nthe Rigveda, representing the number of days that had elapsed from the\r\nbeginning of the Kaliyuga. Burnell[139] states that this system is even yet\r\nin use for remembering rules to calculate horoscopes, and for astronomical\r\ntables.\r\n\r\nA second system of this kind is still used in the pagination of manuscripts\r\nin Ceylon, Siam, and Burma, having also had its rise in southern India. In\r\nthis the thirty-four consonants when followed by _a_ (as _ka_ ... _la_)\r\ndesignate the numbers 1-34; by _[=a]_ (as _k[=a]_ ... _l[=a]_), those from\r\n35 to 68; by _i_ (_ki_ ... _li_), those from 69 to 102, inclusive; and so\r\non.[140]\r\n\r\nAs already stated, however, the Hindu system as thus far described was no\r\nimprovement upon many others of the ancients, such as those used by the\r\nGreeks and the Hebrews. Having no zero, it was impracticable to designate\r\nthe tens, hundreds, and other units of higher order by the same symbols\r\nused for the units from one to nine. In other words, there was no\r\npossibility of place value without some further improvement. So the\r\nN[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t {41} symbols required the writing of \"thousand seven\r\ntwenty-four\" about like T 7, tw, 4 in modern symbols, instead of 7024, in\r\nwhich the seven of the thousands, the two of the tens (concealed in the\r\nword twenty, being originally \"twain of tens,\" the _-ty_ signifying ten),\r\nand the four of the units are given as spoken and the order of the unit\r\n(tens, hundreds, etc.) is given by the place. To complete the system only\r\nthe zero was needed; but it was probably eight centuries after the\r\nN[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t inscriptions were cut, before this important symbol\r\nappeared; and not until a considerably later period did it become well\r\nknown. Who it was to whom the invention is due, or where he lived, or even\r\nin what century, will probably always remain a mystery.[141] It is possible\r\nthat one of the forms of ancient abacus suggested to some Hindu astronomer\r\nor mathematician the use of a symbol to stand for the vacant line when the\r\ncounters were removed. It is well established that in different parts of\r\nIndia the names of the higher powers took different forms, even the order\r\nbeing interchanged.[142] Nevertheless, as the significance of the name of\r\nthe unit was given by the order in reading, these variations did not lead\r\nto error. Indeed the variation itself may have necessitated the\r\nintroduction of a word to signify a vacant place or lacking unit, with the\r\nultimate introduction of a zero symbol for this word.\r\n\r\nTo enable us to appreciate the force of this argument a large number,\r\n8,443,682,155, may be considered as the Hindus wrote and read it, and then,\r\nby way of contrast, as the Greeks and Arabs would have read it.\r\n\r\n{42}\r\n\r\n_Modern American reading_, 8 billion, 443 million, 682 thousand, 155.\r\n\r\n_Hindu_, 8 padmas, 4 vyarbudas, 4 k[=o][t.]is, 3 prayutas, 6 lak[s.]as, 8\r\nayutas, 2 sahasra, 1 ['s]ata, 5 da['s]an, 5.\r\n\r\n_Arabic and early German_, eight thousand thousand thousand and four\r\nhundred thousand thousand and forty-three thousand thousand, and six\r\nhundred thousand and eighty-two thousand and one hundred fifty-five (or\r\nfive and fifty).\r\n\r\n_Greek_, eighty-four myriads of myriads and four thousand three hundred\r\nsixty-eight myriads and two thousand and one hundred fifty-five.\r\n\r\nAs Woepcke[143] pointed out, the reading of numbers of this kind shows that\r\nthe notation adopted by the Hindus tended to bring out the place idea. No\r\nother language than the Sanskrit has made such consistent application, in\r\nnumeration, of the decimal system of numbers. The introduction of myriads\r\nas in the Greek, and thousands as in Arabic and in modern numeration, is\r\nreally a step away from a decimal scheme. So in the numbers below one\r\nhundred, in English, eleven and twelve are out of harmony with the rest of\r\nthe -teens, while the naming of all the numbers between ten and twenty is\r\nnot analogous to the naming of the numbers above twenty. To conform to our\r\nwritten system we should have ten-one, ten-two, ten-three, and so on, as we\r\nhave twenty-one, twenty-two, and the like. The Sanskrit is consistent, the\r\nunits, however, preceding the tens and hundreds. Nor did any other ancient\r\npeople carry the numeration as far as did the Hindus.[144]\r\n\r\n{43}\r\n\r\nWhen the _a[.n]kapalli_,[145] the decimal-place system of writing numbers,\r\nwas perfected, the tenth symbol was called the _['s][=u]nyabindu_,\r\ngenerally shortened to _['s][=u]nya_ (the void). Brockhaus[146] has well\r\nsaid that if there was any invention for which the Hindus, by all their\r\nphilosophy and religion, were well fitted, it was the invention of a symbol\r\nfor zero. This making of nothingness the crux of a tremendous achievement\r\nwas a step in complete harmony with the genius of the Hindu.\r\n\r\nIt is generally thought that this _['s][=u]nya_ as a symbol was not used\r\nbefore about 500 A.D., although some writers have placed it earlier.[147]\r\nSince [=A]ryabha[t.]a gives our common method of extracting roots, it would\r\nseem that he may have known a decimal notation,[148] although he did not\r\nuse the characters from which our numerals are derived.[149] Moreover, he\r\nfrequently speaks of the {44} void.[150] If he refers to a symbol this\r\nwould put the zero as far back as 500 A.D., but of course he may have\r\nreferred merely to the concept of nothingness.\r\n\r\nA little later, but also in the sixth century, Var[=a]ha-Mihira[151] wrote\r\na work entitled _B[r.]hat Sa[m.]hit[=a]_[152] in which he frequently uses\r\n_['s][=u]nya_ in speaking of numerals, so that it has been thought that he\r\nwas referring to a definite symbol. This, of course, would add to the\r\nprobability that [=A]ryabha[t.]a was doing the same.\r\n\r\nIt should also be mentioned as a matter of interest, and somewhat related\r\nto the question at issue, that Var[=a]ha-Mihira used the word-system with\r\nplace value[153] as explained above.\r\n\r\nThe first kind of alphabetic numerals and also the word-system (in both of\r\nwhich the place value is used) are plays upon, or variations of, position\r\narithmetic, which would be most likely to occur in the country of its\r\norigin.[154]\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the next century (c. 620 A.D.) B[=a][n.]a[155] wrote of\r\nSubandhus's _V[=a]savadatt[=a]_ as a celebrated work, {45} and mentioned\r\nthat the stars dotting the sky are here compared with zeros, these being\r\npoints as in the modern Arabic system. On the other hand, a strong argument\r\nagainst any Hindu knowledge of the symbol zero at this time is the fact\r\nthat about 700 A.D. the Arabs overran the province of Sind and thus had an\r\nopportunity of knowing the common methods used there for writing numbers.\r\nAnd yet, when they received the complete system in 776 they looked upon it\r\nas something new.[156] Such evidence is not conclusive, but it tends to\r\nshow that the complete system was probably not in common use in India at\r\nthe beginning of the eighth century. On the other hand, we must bear in\r\nmind the fact that a traveler in Germany in the year 1700 would probably\r\nhave heard or seen nothing of decimal fractions, although these were\r\nperfected a century before that date. The élite of the mathematicians may\r\nhave known the zero even in [=A]ryabha[t.]a's time, while the merchants and\r\nthe common people may not have grasped the significance of the novelty\r\nuntil a long time after. On the whole, the evidence seems to point to the\r\nwest coast of India as the region where the complete system was first\r\nseen.[157] As mentioned above, traces of the numeral words with place\r\nvalue, which do not, however, absolutely require a decimal place-system of\r\nsymbols, are found very early in Cambodia, as well as in India.\r\n\r\nConcerning the earliest epigraphical instances of the use of the nine\r\nsymbols, plus the zero, with place value, there {46} is some question.\r\nColebrooke[158] in 1807 warned against the possibility of forgery in many\r\nof the ancient copper-plate land grants. On this account Fleet, in the\r\n_Indian Antiquary_,[159] discusses at length this phase of the work of the\r\nepigraphists in India, holding that many of these forgeries were made about\r\nthe end of the eleventh century. Colebrooke[160] takes a more rational view\r\nof these forgeries than does Kaye, who seems to hold that they tend to\r\ninvalidate the whole Indian hypothesis. \"But even where that may be\r\nsuspected, the historical uses of a monument fabricated so much nearer to\r\nthe times to which it assumes to belong, will not be entirely superseded.\r\nThe necessity of rendering the forged grant credible would compel a\r\nfabricator to adhere to history, and conform to established notions: and\r\nthe tradition, which prevailed in his time, and by which he must be guided,\r\nwould probably be so much nearer to the truth, as it was less remote from\r\nthe period which it concerned.\"[161] Bühler[162] gives the copper-plate\r\nGurjara inscription of Cedi-sa[m.]vat 346 (595 A.D.) as the oldest\r\nepigraphical use of the numerals[163] \"in which the symbols correspond to\r\nthe alphabet numerals of the period and the place.\" Vincent A. Smith[164]\r\nquotes a stone inscription of 815 A.D., dated Sa[m.]vat 872. So F. Kielhorn\r\nin the _Epigraphia Indica_[165] gives a Pathari pillar inscription of\r\nParabala, dated Vikrama-sa[m.]vat 917, which corresponds to 861 A.D., {47}\r\nand refers also to another copper-plate inscription dated Vikrama-sa[m.]vat\r\n813 (756 A.D.). The inscription quoted by V. A. Smith above is that given\r\nby D. R. Bhandarkar,[166] and another is given by the same writer as of\r\ndate Saka-sa[m.]vat 715 (798 A.D.), being incised on a pilaster.\r\nKielhorn[167] also gives two copper-plate inscriptions of the time of\r\nMahendrapala of Kanauj, Valhab[=i]-sa[m.]vat 574 (893 A.D.) and\r\nVikrama-sa[m.]vat 956 (899 A.D.). That there should be any inscriptions of\r\ndate as early even as 750 A.D., would tend to show that the system was at\r\nleast a century older. As will be shown in the further development, it was\r\nmore than two centuries after the introduction of the numerals into Europe\r\nthat they appeared there upon coins and inscriptions. While Thibaut[168]\r\ndoes not consider it necessary to quote any specific instances of the use\r\nof the numerals, he states that traces are found from 590 A.D. on. \"That\r\nthe system now in use by all civilized nations is of Hindu origin cannot be\r\ndoubted; no other nation has any claim upon its discovery, especially since\r\nthe references to the origin of the system which are found in the nations\r\nof western Asia point unanimously towards India.\"[169]\r\n\r\nThe testimony and opinions of men like Bühler, Kielhorn, V. A. Smith,\r\nBhandarkar, and Thibaut are entitled to the most serious consideration. As\r\nauthorities on ancient Indian epigraphy no others rank higher. Their work\r\nis accepted by Indian scholars the world over, and their united judgment as\r\nto the rise of the system with a place value--that it took place in India\r\nas early as the {48} sixth century A.D.--must stand unless new evidence of\r\ngreat weight can be submitted to the contrary.\r\n\r\nMany early writers remarked upon the diversity of Indian numeral forms.\r\nAl-B[=i]r[=u]n[=i] was probably the first; noteworthy is also Johannes\r\nHispalensis,[170] who gives the variant forms for seven and four. We insert\r\non p. 49 a table of numerals used with place value. While the chief\r\nauthority for this is Bühler,[171] several specimens are given which are\r\nnot found in his work and which are of unusual interest.\r\n\r\nThe ['S][=a]rad[=a] forms given in the table use the circle as a symbol for\r\n1 and the dot for zero. They are taken from the paging and text of _The\r\nKashmirian Atharva-Veda_[172], of which the manuscript used is certainly\r\nfour hundred years old. Similar forms are found in a manuscript belonging\r\nto the University of Tübingen. Two other series presented are from Tibetan\r\nbooks in the library of one of the authors.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of comparison the modern Sanskrit and Arabic numeral forms are\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n  Sanskrit, [Illustration]\r\n  Arabic, [Illustration]\r\n\r\n{49}\r\n\r\nNUMERALS USED WITH PLACE VALUE\r\n\r\n      1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0\r\n  a[173] [Illustration]\r\n  b[174] [Illustration]\r\n  c[175] [Illustration]\r\n  d[176] [Illustration]\r\n  e[177] [Illustration]\r\n  f[178] [Illustration]\r\n  g[179] [Illustration]\r\n  h[180] [Illustration]\r\n  i[180] [Illustration]\r\n  j[181] [Illustration]\r\n  k[181] [Illustration]\r\n  l[182] [Illustration]\r\n  m[183] [Illustration]\r\n  n[184] [Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{51}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SYMBOL ZERO\r\n\r\nWhat has been said of the improved Hindu system with a place value does not\r\ntouch directly the origin of a symbol for zero, although it assumes that\r\nsuch a symbol exists. The importance of such a sign, the fact that it is a\r\nprerequisite to a place-value system, and the further fact that without it\r\nthe Hindu-Arabic numerals would never have dominated the computation system\r\nof the western world, make it proper to devote a chapter to its origin and\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIt was some centuries after the primitive Br[=a]hm[=i] and\r\nKharo[s.][t.]h[=i] numerals had made their appearance in India that the\r\nzero first appeared there, although such a character was used by the\r\nBabylonians[185] in the centuries immediately preceding the Christian era.\r\nThe symbol is [Babylonian zero symbol] or [Babylonian zero symbol], and\r\napparently it was not used in calculation. Nor does it always occur when\r\nunits of any order are lacking; thus 180 is written [Babylonian numerals\r\n180] with the meaning three sixties and no units, since 181 immediately\r\nfollowing is [Babylonian numerals 181], three sixties and one unit.[186]\r\nThe main {52} use of this Babylonian symbol seems to have been in the\r\nfractions, 60ths, 3600ths, etc., and somewhat similar to the Greek use of\r\n[Greek: o], for [Greek: ouden], with the meaning _vacant_.\r\n\r\n\"The earliest undoubted occurrence of a zero in India is an inscription at\r\nGwalior, dated Samvat 933 (876 A.D.). Where 50 garlands are mentioned (line\r\n20), 50 is written [Gwalior numerals 50]. 270 (line 4) is written [Gwalior\r\nnumerals 270].\"[187] The Bakh[s.][=a]l[=i] Manuscript[188] probably\r\nantedates this, using the point or dot as a zero symbol. Bayley mentions a\r\ngrant of Jaika Rashtrakúta of Bharuj, found at Okamandel, of date 738 A.D.,\r\nwhich contains a zero, and also a coin with indistinct Gupta date 707 (897\r\nA.D.), but the reliability of Bayley's work is questioned. As has been\r\nnoted, the appearance of the numerals in inscriptions and on coins would be\r\nof much later occurrence than the origin and written exposition of the\r\nsystem. From the period mentioned the spread was rapid over all of India,\r\nsave the southern part, where the Tamil and Malayalam people retain the old\r\nsystem even to the present day.[189]\r\n\r\nAside from its appearance in early inscriptions, there is still another\r\nindication of the Hindu origin of the symbol in the special treatment of\r\nthe concept zero in the early works on arithmetic. Brahmagupta, who lived\r\nin Ujjain, the center of Indian astronomy,[190] in the early part {53} of\r\nthe seventh century, gives in his arithmetic[191] a distinct treatment of\r\nthe properties of zero. He does not discuss a symbol, but he shows by his\r\ntreatment that in some way zero had acquired a special significance not\r\nfound in the Greek or other ancient arithmetics. A still more scientific\r\ntreatment is given by Bh[=a]skara,[192] although in one place he permits\r\nhimself an unallowed liberty in dividing by zero. The most recently\r\ndiscovered work of ancient Indian mathematical lore, the\r\nGanita-S[=a]ra-Sa[.n]graha[193] of Mah[=a]v[=i]r[=a]c[=a]rya (c. 830 A.D.),\r\nwhile it does not use the numerals with place value, has a similar\r\ndiscussion of the calculation with zero.\r\n\r\nWhat suggested the form for the zero is, of course, purely a matter of\r\nconjecture. The dot, which the Hindus used to fill up lacunæ in their\r\nmanuscripts, much as we indicate a break in a sentence,[194] would have\r\nbeen a more natural symbol; and this is the one which the Hindus first\r\nused[195] and which most Arabs use to-day. There was also used for this\r\npurpose a cross, like our X, and this is occasionally found as a zero\r\nsymbol.[196] In the Bakh[s.][=a]l[=i] manuscript above mentioned, the word\r\n_['s][=u]nya_, with the dot as its symbol, is used to denote the unknown\r\nquantity, as well as to denote zero. An analogous use of the {54} zero, for\r\nthe unknown quantity in a proportion, appears in a Latin manuscript of some\r\nlectures by Gottfried Wolack in the University of Erfurt in 1467 and\r\n1468.[197] The usage was noted even as early as the eighteenth\r\ncentury.[198]\r\n\r\nThe small circle was possibly suggested by the spurred circle which was\r\nused for ten.[199] It has also been thought that the omicron used by\r\nPtolemy in his _Almagest_, to mark accidental blanks in the sexagesimal\r\nsystem which he employed, may have influenced the Indian writers.[200] This\r\nsymbol was used quite generally in Europe and Asia, and the Arabic\r\nastronomer Al-Batt[=a]n[=i][201] (died 929 A.D.) used a similar symbol in\r\nconnection with the alphabetic system of numerals. The occasional use by\r\nAl-Batt[=a]n[=i] of the Arabic negative, _l[=a]_, to indicate the absence\r\nof minutes {55} (or seconds), is noted by Nallino.[202] Noteworthy is also\r\nthe use of the [Circle] for unity in the ['S][=a]rad[=a] characters of the\r\nKashmirian Atharva-Veda, the writing being at least 400 years old.\r\nBh[=a]skara (c. 1150) used a small circle above a number to indicate\r\nsubtraction, and in the Tartar writing a redundant word is removed by\r\ndrawing an oval around it. It would be interesting to know whether our\r\nscore mark [score mark], read \"four in the hole,\" could trace its pedigree\r\nto the same sources. O'Creat[203] (c. 1130), in a letter to his teacher,\r\nAdelhard of Bath, uses [Greek: t] for zero, being an abbreviation for the\r\nword _teca_ which we shall see was one of the names used for zero, although\r\nit could quite as well be from [Greek: tziphra]. More rarely O'Creat uses\r\n[circle with bar], applying the name _cyfra_ to both forms. Frater\r\nSigsboto[204] (c. 1150) uses the same symbol. Other peculiar forms are\r\nnoted by Heiberg[205] as being in use among the Byzantine Greeks in the\r\nfifteenth century. It is evident from the text that some of these writers\r\ndid not understand the import of the new system.[206]\r\n\r\nAlthough the dot was used at first in India, as noted above, the small\r\ncircle later replaced it and continues in use to this day. The Arabs,\r\nhowever, did not adopt the {56} circle, since it bore some resemblance to\r\nthe letter which expressed the number five in the alphabet system.[207] The\r\nearliest Arabic zero known is the dot, used in a manuscript of 873\r\nA.D.[208] Sometimes both the dot and the circle are used in the same work,\r\nhaving the same meaning, which is the case in an Arabic MS., an abridged\r\narithmetic of Jamshid,[209] 982 A.H. (1575 A.D.). As given in this work the\r\nnumerals are [symbols]. The form for 5 varies, in some works becoming\r\n[symbol] or [symbol]; [symbol] is found in Egypt and [symbol] appears in\r\nsome fonts of type. To-day the Arabs use the 0 only when, under European\r\ninfluence, they adopt the ordinary system. Among the Chinese the first\r\ndefinite trace of zero is in the work of Tsin[210] of 1247 A.D. The form is\r\nthe circular one of the Hindus, and undoubtedly was brought to China by\r\nsome traveler.\r\n\r\nThe name of this all-important symbol also demands some attention,\r\nespecially as we are even yet quite undecided as to what to call it. We\r\nspeak of it to-day as _zero, naught_, and even _cipher_; the telephone\r\noperator often calls it _O_, and the illiterate or careless person calls it\r\n_aught_. In view of all this uncertainty we may well inquire what it has\r\nbeen called in the past.[211]\r\n\r\n{57}\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the Hindus called it _['s][=u]nya_, \"void.\"[212] This\r\npassed over into the Arabic as _a[s.]-[s.]ifr_ or _[s.]ifr_.[213] When\r\nLeonard of Pisa (1202) wrote upon the Hindu numerals he spoke of this\r\ncharacter as _zephirum_.[214] Maximus Planudes (1330), writing under both\r\nthe Greek and the Arabic influence, called it _tziphra_.[215] In a treatise\r\non arithmetic written in the Italian language by Jacob of Florence[216]\r\n{58} (1307) it is called _zeuero_,[217] while in an arithmetic of Giovanni\r\ndi Danti of Arezzo (1370) the word appears as _çeuero_.[218] Another form\r\nis _zepiro_,[219] which was also a step from _zephirum_ to zero.[220]\r\n\r\nOf course the English _cipher_, French _chiffre_, is derived from the same\r\nArabic word, _a[s.]-[s.]ifr_, but in several languages it has come to mean\r\nthe numeral figures in general. A trace of this appears in our word\r\n_ciphering_, meaning figuring or computing.[221] Johann Huswirt[222] uses\r\nthe word with both meanings; he gives for the tenth character the four\r\nnames _theca, circulus, cifra_, and _figura nihili_. In this statement\r\nHuswirt probably follows, as did many writers of that period, the\r\n_Algorismus_ of Johannes de Sacrobosco (c. 1250 A.D.), who was also known\r\nas John of Halifax or John of Holywood. The commentary of {59} Petrus de\r\nDacia[223] (c. 1291 A.D.) on the _Algorismus vulgaris_ of Sacrobosco was\r\nalso widely used. The widespread use of this Englishman's work on\r\narithmetic in the universities of that time is attested by the large\r\nnumber[224] of MSS. from the thirteenth to the seventeenth century still\r\nextant, twenty in Munich, twelve in Vienna, thirteen in Erfurt, several in\r\nEngland given by Halliwell,[225] ten listed in Coxe's _Catalogue of the\r\nOxford College Library_, one in the Plimpton collection,[226] one in the\r\nColumbia University Library, and, of course, many others.\r\n\r\nFrom _a[s.]-[s.]ifr _has come _zephyr, cipher,_ and finally the abridged\r\nform _zero_. The earliest printed work in which is found this final form\r\nappears to be Calandri's arithmetic of 1491,[227] while in manuscript it\r\nappears at least as early as the middle of the fourteenth century.[228] It\r\nalso appears in a work, _Le Kadran des marchans_, by Jehan {60}\r\nCertain,[229] written in 1485. This word soon became fairly well known in\r\nSpain[230] and France.[231] The medieval writers also spoke of it as the\r\n_sipos_,[232] and occasionally as the _wheel_,[233] _circulus_[234] (in\r\nGerman _das Ringlein_[235]), _circular {61} note_,[236] _theca_,[237] long\r\nsupposed to be from its resemblance to the Greek theta, but explained by\r\nPetrus de Dacia as being derived from the name of the iron[238] used to\r\nbrand thieves and robbers with a circular mark placed on the forehead or on\r\nthe cheek. It was also called _omicron_[239] (the Greek _o_), being\r\nsometimes written õ or [Greek: ph] to distinguish it from the letter _o_.\r\nIt also went by the name _null_[240] (in the Latin books {62} _nihil_[241]\r\nor _nulla_,[242] and in the French _rien_[243]), and very commonly by the\r\nname _cipher_.[244] Wallis[245] gives one of the earliest extended\r\ndiscussions of the various forms of the word, giving certain other\r\nvariations worthy of note, as _ziphra_, _zifera_, _siphra_, _ciphra_,\r\n_tsiphra_, _tziphra,_ and the Greek [Greek: tziphra].[246]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{63}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NUMERALS INTO EUROPE BY BOETHIUS\r\n\r\nJust as we were quite uncertain as to the origin of the numeral forms, so\r\ntoo are we uncertain as to the time and place of their introduction into\r\nEurope. There are two general theories as to this introduction. The first\r\nis that they were carried by the Moors to Spain in the eighth or ninth\r\ncentury, and thence were transmitted to Christian Europe, a theory which\r\nwill be considered later. The second, advanced by Woepcke,[247] is that\r\nthey were not brought to Spain by the Moors, but that they were already in\r\nSpain when the Arabs arrived there, having reached the West through the\r\nNeo-Pythagoreans. There are two facts to support this second theory: (1)\r\nthe forms of these numerals are characteristic, differing materially from\r\nthose which were brought by Leonardo of Pisa from Northern Africa early in\r\nthe thirteenth century (before 1202 A.D.); (2) they are essentially those\r\nwhich {64} tradition has so persistently assigned to Boethius (c. 500\r\nA.D.), and which he would naturally have received, if at all, from these\r\nsame Neo-Pythagoreans or from the sources from which they derived them.\r\nFurthermore, Woepcke points out that the Arabs on entering Spain (711 A.D.)\r\nwould naturally have followed their custom of adopting for the computation\r\nof taxes the numerical systems of the countries they conquered,[248] so\r\nthat the numerals brought from Spain to Italy, not having undergone the\r\nsame modifications as those of the Eastern Arab empire, would have\r\ndiffered, as they certainly did, from those that came through Bagdad. The\r\ntheory is that the Hindu system, without the zero, early reached Alexandria\r\n(say 450 A.D.), and that the Neo-Pythagorean love for the mysterious and\r\nespecially for the Oriental led to its use as something bizarre and\r\ncabalistic; that it was then passed along the Mediterranean, reaching\r\nBoethius in Athens or in Rome, and to the schools of Spain, being\r\ndiscovered in Africa and Spain by the Arabs even before they themselves\r\nknew the improved system with the place value.\r\n\r\n{65}\r\n\r\nA recent theory set forth by Bubnov[249] also deserves mention, chiefly\r\nbecause of the seriousness of purpose shown by this well-known writer.\r\nBubnov holds that the forms first found in Europe are derived from ancient\r\nsymbols used on the abacus, but that the zero is of Hindu origin. This\r\ntheory does not seem tenable, however, in the light of the evidence already\r\nset forth.\r\n\r\nTwo questions are presented by Woepcke's theory: (1) What was the nature of\r\nthese Spanish numerals, and how were they made known to Italy? (2) Did\r\nBoethius know them?\r\n\r\nThe Spanish forms of the numerals were called the _[h.]ur[=u]f\r\nal-[.g]ob[=a]r_, the [.g]ob[=a]r or dust numerals, as distinguished from\r\nthe _[h.]ur[=u]f al-jumal_ or alphabetic numerals. Probably the latter,\r\nunder the influence of the Syrians or Jews,[250] were also used by the\r\nArabs. The significance of the term [.g]ob[=a]r is doubtless that these\r\nnumerals were written on the dust abacus, this plan being distinct from the\r\ncounter method of representing numbers. It is also worthy of note that\r\nAl-B[=i]r[=u]n[=i] states that the Hindus often performed numerical\r\ncomputations in the sand. The term is found as early as c. 950, in the\r\nverses of an anonymous writer of Kairw[=a]n, in Tunis, in which the author\r\nspeaks of one of his works on [.g]ob[=a]r calculation;[251] and, much\r\nlater, the Arab writer Ab[=u] Bekr Mo[h.]ammed ibn `Abdall[=a]h, surnamed\r\nal-[H.]a[s.][s.][=a]r {66} (the arithmetician), wrote a work of which the\r\nsecond chapter was \"On the dust figures.\"[252]\r\n\r\nThe [.g]ob[=a]r numerals themselves were first made known to modern\r\nscholars by Silvestre de Sacy, who discovered them in an Arabic manuscript\r\nfrom the library of the ancient abbey of St.-Germain-des-Prés.[253] The\r\nsystem has nine characters, but no zero. A dot above a character indicates\r\ntens, two dots hundreds, and so on, [5 with dot] meaning 50, and [5 with 3\r\ndots] meaning 5000. It has been suggested that possibly these dots,\r\nsprinkled like dust above the numerals, gave rise to the word\r\n_[.g]ob[=a]r_,[254] but this is not at all probable. This system of dots is\r\nfound in Persia at a much later date with numerals quite like the modern\r\nArabic;[255] but that it was used at all is significant, for it is hardly\r\nlikely that the western system would go back to Persia, when the perfected\r\nHindu one was near at hand.\r\n\r\nAt first sight there would seem to be some reason for believing that this\r\nfeature of the [.g]ob[=a]r system was of {67} Arabic origin, and that the\r\npresent zero of these people,[256] the dot, was derived from it. It was\r\nentirely natural that the Semitic people generally should have adopted such\r\na scheme, since their diacritical marks would suggest it, not to speak of\r\nthe possible influence of the Greek accents in the Hellenic number system.\r\nWhen we consider, however, that the dot is found for zero in the\r\nBakh[s.][=a]l[=i] manuscript,[257] and that it was used in subscript form\r\nin the _Kit[=a]b al-Fihrist_[258] in the tenth century, and as late as the\r\nsixteenth century,[259] although in this case probably under Arabic\r\ninfluence, we are forced to believe that this form may also have been of\r\nHindu origin.\r\n\r\nThe fact seems to be that, as already stated,[260] the Arabs did not\r\nimmediately adopt the Hindu zero, because it resembled their 5; they used\r\nthe superscript dot as serving their purposes fairly well; they may,\r\nindeed, have carried this to the west and have added it to the [.g]ob[=a]r\r\nforms already there, just as they transmitted it to the Persians.\r\nFurthermore, the Arab and Hebrew scholars of Northern Africa in the tenth\r\ncentury knew these numerals as Indian forms, for a commentary on the\r\n_S[=e]fer Ye[s.][=i]r[=a]h_ by Ab[=u] Sahl ibn Tamim (probably composed at\r\nKairw[=a]n, c. 950) speaks of \"the Indian arithmetic known under the name\r\nof _[.g]ob[=a]r_ or dust calculation.\"[261] All this suggests that the\r\nArabs may very {68} likely have known the [.g]ob[=a]r forms before the\r\nnumerals reached them again in 773.[262] The term \"[.g]ob[=a]r numerals\"\r\nwas also used without any reference to the peculiar use of dots.[263] In\r\nthis connection it is worthy of mention that the Algerians employed two\r\ndifferent forms of numerals in manuscripts even of the fourteenth\r\ncentury,[264] and that the Moroccans of to-day employ the European forms\r\ninstead of the present Arabic.\r\n\r\nThe Indian use of subscript dots to indicate the tens, hundreds, thousands,\r\netc., is established by a passage in the _Kit[=a]b al-Fihrist_[265] (987\r\nA.D.) in which the writer discusses the written language of the people of\r\nIndia. Notwithstanding the importance of this reference for the early\r\nhistory of the numerals, it has not been mentioned by previous writers on\r\nthis subject. The numeral forms given are those which have usually been\r\ncalled Indian,[266] in opposition to [.g]ob[=a]r. In this document the dots\r\nare placed below the characters, instead of being superposed as described\r\nabove. The significance was the same.\r\n\r\nIn form these [.g]ob[=a]r numerals resemble our own much more closely than\r\nthe Arab numerals do. They varied more or less, but were substantially as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n{69}\r\n\r\n  1[267][Illustration]\r\n  2[268][Illustration]\r\n  3[269][Illustration]\r\n  4[270][Illustration]\r\n  5[271][Illustration]\r\n  6[271][Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe question of the possible influence of the Egyptian demotic and hieratic\r\nordinal forms has been so often suggested that it seems well to introduce\r\nthem at this point, for comparison with the [.g]ob[=a]r forms. They would\r\nas appropriately be used in connection with the Hindu forms, and the\r\nevidence of a relation of the first three with all these systems is\r\napparent. The only further resemblance is in the Demotic 4 and in the 9, so\r\nthat the statement that the Hindu forms in general came from {70} this\r\nsource has no foundation. The first four Egyptian cardinal numerals[272]\r\nresemble more the modern Arabic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEMOTIC AND HIERATIC ORDINALS]\r\n\r\nThis theory of the very early introduction of the numerals into Europe\r\nfails in several points. In the first place the early Western forms are not\r\nknown; in the second place some early Eastern forms are like the\r\n[.g]ob[=a]r, as is seen in the third line on p. 69, where the forms are\r\nfrom a manuscript written at Shiraz about 970 A.D., and in which some\r\nwestern Arabic forms, e.g. [symbol] for 2, are also used. Probably most\r\nsignificant of all is the fact that the [.g]ob[=a]r numerals as given by\r\nSacy are all, with the exception of the symbol for eight, either single\r\nArabic letters or combinations of letters. So much for the Woepcke theory\r\nand the meaning of the [.g]ob[=a]r numerals. We now have to consider the\r\nquestion as to whether Boethius knew these [.g]ob[=a]r forms, or forms akin\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThis large question[273] suggests several minor ones: (1) Who was Boethius?\r\n(2) Could he have known these numerals? (3) Is there any positive or strong\r\ncircumstantial evidence that he did know them? (4) What are the\r\nprobabilities in the case?\r\n\r\n{71}\r\n\r\nFirst, who was Boethius,--Divus[274] Boethius as he was called in the\r\nMiddle Ages? Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius[275] was born at Rome c.\r\n475. He was a member of the distinguished family of the Anicii,[276] which\r\nhad for some time before his birth been Christian. Early left an orphan,\r\nthe tradition is that he was taken to Athens at about the age of ten, and\r\nthat he remained there eighteen years.[277] He married Rusticiana, daughter\r\nof the senator Symmachus, and this union of two such powerful families\r\nallowed him to move in the highest circles.[278] Standing strictly for the\r\nright, and against all iniquity at court, he became the object of hatred on\r\nthe part of all the unscrupulous element near the throne, and his bold\r\ndefense of the ex-consul Albinus, unjustly accused of treason, led to his\r\nimprisonment at Pavia[279] and his execution in 524.[280] Not many\r\ngenerations after his death, the period being one in which historical\r\ncriticism was at its lowest ebb, the church found it profitable to look\r\nupon his execution as a martyrdom.[281] He was {72} accordingly looked upon\r\nas a saint,[282] his bones were enshrined,[283] and as a natural\r\nconsequence his books were among the classics in the church schools for a\r\nthousand years.[284] It is pathetic, however, to think of the medieval\r\nstudent trying to extract mental nourishment from a work so abstract, so\r\nmeaningless, so unnecessarily complicated, as the arithmetic of Boethius.\r\n\r\nHe was looked upon by his contemporaries and immediate successors as a\r\nmaster, for Cassiodorus[285] (c. 490-c. 585 A.D.) says to him: \"Through\r\nyour translations the music of Pythagoras and the astronomy of Ptolemy are\r\nread by those of Italy, and the arithmetic of Nicomachus and the geometry\r\nof Euclid are known to those of the West.\"[286] Founder of the medieval\r\nscholasticism, {73} distinguishing the trivium and quadrivium,[287] writing\r\nthe only classics of his time, Gibbon well called him \"the last of the\r\nRomans whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their\r\ncountryman.\"[288]\r\n\r\nThe second question relating to Boethius is this: Could he possibly have\r\nknown the Hindu numerals? In view of the relations that will be shown to\r\nhave existed between the East and the West, there can only be an\r\naffirmative answer to this question. The numerals had existed, without the\r\nzero, for several centuries; they had been well known in India; there had\r\nbeen a continued interchange of thought between the East and West; and\r\nwarriors, ambassadors, scholars, and the restless trader, all had gone back\r\nand forth, by land or more frequently by sea, between the Mediterranean\r\nlands and the centers of Indian commerce and culture. Boethius could very\r\nwell have learned one or more forms of Hindu numerals from some traveler or\r\nmerchant.\r\n\r\nTo justify this statement it is necessary to speak more fully of these\r\nrelations between the Far East and Europe. It is true that we have no\r\nrecords of the interchange of learning, in any large way, between eastern\r\nAsia and central Europe in the century preceding the time of Boethius. But\r\nit is one of the mistakes of scholars to believe that they are the sole\r\ntransmitters of knowledge. {74} As a matter of fact there is abundant\r\nreason for believing that Hindu numerals would naturally have been known to\r\nthe Arabs, and even along every trade route to the remote west, long before\r\nthe zero entered to make their place-value possible, and that the\r\ncharacters, the methods of calculating, the improvements that took place\r\nfrom time to time, the zero when it appeared, and the customs as to solving\r\nbusiness problems, would all have been made known from generation to\r\ngeneration along these same trade routes from the Orient to the Occident.\r\nIt must always be kept in mind that it was to the tradesman and the\r\nwandering scholar that the spread of such learning was due, rather than to\r\nthe school man. Indeed, Avicenna[289] (980-1037 A.D.) in a short biography\r\nof himself relates that when his people were living at Bokh[=a]ra his\r\nfather sent him to the house of a grocer to learn the Hindu art of\r\nreckoning, in which this grocer (oil dealer, possibly) was expert. Leonardo\r\nof Pisa, too, had a similar training.\r\n\r\nThe whole question of this spread of mercantile knowledge along the trade\r\nroutes is so connected with the [.g]ob[=a]r numerals, the Boethius\r\nquestion, Gerbert, Leonardo of Pisa, and other names and events, that a\r\ndigression for its consideration now becomes necessary.[290]\r\n\r\n{75}\r\n\r\nEven in very remote times, before the Hindu numerals were sculptured in the\r\ncave of N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t, there were trade relations between Arabia and\r\nIndia. Indeed, long before the Aryans went to India the great Turanian race\r\nhad spread its civilization from the Mediterranean to the Indus.[291] At a\r\nmuch later period the Arabs were the intermediaries between Egypt and Syria\r\non the west, and the farther Orient.[292] In the sixth century B.C.,\r\nHecatæus,[293] the father of geography, was acquainted not only with the\r\nMediterranean lands but with the countries as far as the Indus,[294] and in\r\nBiblical times there were regular triennial voyages to India. Indeed, the\r\nstory of Joseph bears witness to the caravan trade from India, across\r\nArabia, and on to the banks of the Nile. About the same time as Hecatæus,\r\nScylax, a Persian admiral under Darius, from Caryanda on the coast of Asia\r\nMinor, traveled to {76} northwest India and wrote upon his ventures.[295]\r\nHe induced the nations along the Indus to acknowledge the Persian\r\nsupremacy, and such number systems as there were in these lands would\r\nnaturally have been known to a man of his attainments.\r\n\r\nA century after Scylax, Herodotus showed considerable knowledge of India,\r\nspeaking of its cotton and its gold,[296] telling how Sesostris[297] fitted\r\nout ships to sail to that country, and mentioning the routes to the east.\r\nThese routes were generally by the Red Sea, and had been followed by the\r\nPhoenicians and the Sabæans, and later were taken by the Greeks and\r\nRomans.[298]\r\n\r\nIn the fourth century B.C. the West and East came into very close\r\nrelations. As early as 330, Pytheas of Massilia (Marseilles) had explored\r\nas far north as the northern end of the British Isles and the coasts of the\r\nGerman Sea, while Macedon, in close touch with southern France, was also\r\nsending her armies under Alexander[299] through Afghanistan as far east as\r\nthe Punjab.[300] Pliny tells us that Alexander the Great employed surveyors\r\nto measure {77} the roads of India; and one of the great highways is\r\ndescribed by Megasthenes, who in 295 B.C., as the ambassador of Seleucus,\r\nresided at P[=a]tal[=i]pu[t.]ra, the present Patna.[301]\r\n\r\nThe Hindus also learned the art of coining from the Greeks, or possibly\r\nfrom the Chinese, and the stores of Greco-Hindu coins still found in\r\nnorthern India are a constant source of historical information.[302] The\r\nR[=a]m[=a]yana speaks of merchants traveling in great caravans and\r\nembarking by sea for foreign lands.[303] Ceylon traded with Malacca and\r\nSiam, and Java was colonized by Hindu traders, so that mercantile knowledge\r\nwas being spread about the Indies during all the formative period of the\r\nnumerals.\r\n\r\nMoreover the results of the early Greek invasion were embodied by\r\nDicæarchus of Messana (about 320 B.C.) in a map that long remained a\r\nstandard. Furthermore, Alexander did not allow his influence on the East to\r\ncease. He divided India into three satrapies,[304] placing Greek governors\r\nover two of them and leaving a Hindu ruler in charge of the third, and in\r\nBactriana, a part of Ariana or ancient Persia, he left governors; and in\r\nthese the western civilization was long in evidence. Some of the Greek and\r\nRoman metrical and astronomical terms {78} found their way, doubtless at\r\nthis time, into the Sanskrit language.[305] Even as late as from the second\r\nto the fifth centuries A.D., Indian coins showed the Hellenic influence.\r\nThe Hindu astronomical terminology reveals the same relationship to western\r\nthought, for Var[=a]ha-Mihira (6th century A.D.), a contemporary of\r\n[=A]ryabha[t.]a, entitled a work of his the _B[r.]hat-Sa[m.]hit[=a]_, a\r\nliteral translation of [Greek: megalê suntaxis] of Ptolemy;[306] and in\r\nvarious ways is this interchange of ideas apparent.[307] It could not have\r\nbeen at all unusual for the ancient Greeks to go to India, for Strabo lays\r\ndown the route, saying that all who make the journey start from Ephesus and\r\ntraverse Phrygia and Cappadocia before taking the direct road.[308] The\r\nproducts of the East were always finding their way to the West, the Greeks\r\ngetting their ginger[309] from Malabar, as the Phoenicians had long before\r\nbrought gold from Malacca.\r\n\r\nGreece must also have had early relations with China, for there is a\r\nnotable similarity between the Greek and Chinese life, as is shown in their\r\nhouses, their domestic customs, their marriage ceremonies, the public\r\nstory-tellers, the puppet shows which Herodotus says were introduced from\r\nEgypt, the street jugglers, the games of dice,[310] the game of\r\nfinger-guessing,[311] the water clock, the {79} music system, the use of\r\nthe myriad,[312] the calendars, and in many other ways.[313] In passing\r\nthrough the suburbs of Peking to-day, on the way to the Great Bell temple,\r\none is constantly reminded of the semi-Greek architecture of Pompeii, so\r\nclosely does modern China touch the old classical civilization of the\r\nMediterranean. The Chinese historians tell us that about 200 B.C. their\r\narms were successful in the far west, and that in 180 B.C. an ambassador\r\nwent to Bactria, then a Greek city, and reported that Chinese products were\r\non sale in the markets there.[314] There is also a noteworthy resemblance\r\nbetween certain Greek and Chinese words,[315] showing that in remote times\r\nthere must have been more or less interchange of thought.\r\n\r\nThe Romans also exchanged products with the East. Horace says, \"A busy\r\ntrader, you hasten to the farthest Indies, flying from poverty over sea,\r\nover crags, over fires.\"[316] The products of the Orient, spices and jewels\r\nfrom India, frankincense from Persia, and silks from China, being more in\r\ndemand than the exports from the Mediterranean lands, the balance of trade\r\nwas against the West, and thus Roman coin found its way eastward. In 1898,\r\nfor example, a number of Roman coins dating from 114 B.C. to Hadrian's time\r\nwere found at Pakl[=i], a part of the Haz[=a]ra district, sixteen miles\r\nnorth of Abbott[=a]b[=a]d,[317] and numerous similar discoveries have been\r\nmade from time to time.\r\n\r\n{80}\r\n\r\nAugustus speaks of envoys received by him from India, a thing never before\r\nknown,[318] and it is not improbable that he also received an embassy from\r\nChina.[319] Suetonius (first century A.D.) speaks in his history of these\r\nrelations,[320] as do several of his contemporaries,[321] and Vergil[322]\r\ntells of Augustus doing battle in Persia. In Pliny's time the trade of the\r\nRoman Empire with Asia amounted to a million and a quarter dollars a year,\r\na sum far greater relatively then than now,[323] while by the time of\r\nConstantine Europe was in direct communication with the Far East.[324]\r\n\r\nIn view of these relations it is not beyond the range of possibility that\r\nproof may sometime come to light to show that the Greeks and Romans knew\r\nsomething of the {81} number system of India, as several writers have\r\nmaintained.[325]\r\n\r\nReturning to the East, there are many evidences of the spread of knowledge\r\nin and about India itself. In the third century B.C. Buddhism began to be a\r\nconnecting medium of thought. It had already permeated the Himalaya\r\nterritory, had reached eastern Turkestan, and had probably gone thence to\r\nChina. Some centuries later (in 62 A.D.) the Chinese emperor sent an\r\nambassador to India, and in 67 A.D. a Buddhist monk was invited to\r\nChina.[326] Then, too, in India itself A['s]oka, whose name has already\r\nbeen mentioned in this work, extended the boundaries of his domains even\r\ninto Afghanistan, so that it was entirely possible for the numerals of the\r\nPunjab to have worked their way north even at that early date.[327]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the influence of Persia must not be forgotten in considering\r\nthis transmission of knowledge. In the fifth century the Persian medical\r\nschool at Jondi-Sapur admitted both the Hindu and the Greek doctrines, and\r\nFirdus[=i] tells us that during the brilliant reign of {82} Khosr[=u]\r\nI,[328] the golden age of Pahlav[=i] literature, the Hindu game of chess\r\nwas introduced into Persia, at a time when wars with the Greeks were\r\nbringing prestige to the Sassanid dynasty.\r\n\r\nAgain, not far from the time of Boethius, in the sixth century, the\r\nEgyptian monk Cosmas, in his earlier years as a trader, made journeys to\r\nAbyssinia and even to India and Ceylon, receiving the name _Indicopleustes_\r\n(the Indian traveler). His map (547 A.D.) shows some knowledge of the earth\r\nfrom the Atlantic to India. Such a man would, with hardly a doubt, have\r\nobserved every numeral system used by the people with whom he\r\nsojourned,[329] and whether or not he recorded his studies in permanent\r\nform he would have transmitted such scraps of knowledge by word of mouth.\r\n\r\nAs to the Arabs, it is a mistake to feel that their activities began with\r\nMohammed. Commerce had always been held in honor by them, and the\r\nQoreish[330] had annually for many generations sent caravans bearing the\r\nspices and textiles of Yemen to the shores of the Mediterranean. In the\r\nfifth century they traded by sea with India and even with China, and\r\n[H.]ira was an emporium for the wares of the East,[331] so that any numeral\r\nsystem of any part of the trading world could hardly have remained\r\nisolated.\r\n\r\nLong before the warlike activity of the Arabs, Alexandria had become the\r\ngreat market-place of the world. From this center caravans traversed Arabia\r\nto Hadramaut, where they met ships from India. Others went north to\r\nDamascus, while still others made their way {83} along the southern shores\r\nof the Mediterranean. Ships sailed from the isthmus of Suez to all the\r\ncommercial ports of Southern Europe and up into the Black Sea. Hindus were\r\nfound among the merchants[332] who frequented the bazaars of Alexandria,\r\nand Brahmins were reported even in Byzantium.\r\n\r\nSuch is a very brief résumé of the evidence showing that the numerals of\r\nthe Punjab and of other parts of India as well, and indeed those of China\r\nand farther Persia, of Ceylon and the Malay peninsula, might well have been\r\nknown to the merchants of Alexandria, and even to those of any other\r\nseaport of the Mediterranean, in the time of Boethius. The Br[=a]hm[=i]\r\nnumerals would not have attracted the attention of scholars, for they had\r\nno zero so far as we know, and therefore they were no better and no worse\r\nthan those of dozens of other systems. If Boethius was attracted to them it\r\nwas probably exactly as any one is naturally attracted to the bizarre or\r\nthe mystic, and he would have mentioned them in his works only\r\nincidentally, as indeed they are mentioned in the manuscripts in which they\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nIn answer therefore to the second question, Could Boethius have known the\r\nHindu numerals? the reply must be, without the slightest doubt, that he\r\ncould easily have known them, and that it would have been strange if a man\r\nof his inquiring mind did not pick up many curious bits of information of\r\nthis kind even though he never thought of making use of them.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the third question, Is there any positive or strong\r\ncircumstantial evidence that Boethius did know these numerals? The question\r\nis not new, {84} nor is it much nearer being answered than it was over two\r\ncenturies ago when Wallis (1693) expressed his doubts about it[333] soon\r\nafter Vossius (1658) had called attention to the matter.[334] Stated\r\nbriefly, there are three works on mathematics attributed to Boethius:[335]\r\n(1) the arithmetic, (2) a work on music, and (3) the geometry.[336]\r\n\r\nThe genuineness of the arithmetic and the treatise on music is generally\r\nrecognized, but the geometry, which contains the Hindu numerals with the\r\nzero, is under suspicion.[337] There are plenty of supporters of the idea\r\nthat Boethius knew the numerals and included them in this book,[338] and on\r\nthe other hand there are as many who {85} feel that the geometry, or at\r\nleast the part mentioning the numerals, is spurious.[339] The argument of\r\nthose who deny the authenticity of the particular passage in question may\r\nbriefly be stated thus:\r\n\r\n1. The falsification of texts has always been the subject of complaint. It\r\nwas so with the Romans,[340] it was common in the Middle Ages,[341] and it\r\nis much more prevalent {86} to-day than we commonly think. We have but to\r\nsee how every hymn-book compiler feels himself authorized to change at will\r\nthe classics of our language, and how unknown editors have mutilated\r\nShakespeare, to see how much more easy it was for medieval scribes to\r\ninsert or eliminate paragraphs without any protest from critics.[342]\r\n\r\n2. If Boethius had known these numerals he would have mentioned them in his\r\narithmetic, but he does not do so.[343]\r\n\r\n3. If he had known them, and had mentioned them in any of his works, his\r\ncontemporaries, disciples, and successors would have known and mentioned\r\nthem. But neither Capella (c. 475)[344] nor any of the numerous medieval\r\nwriters who knew the works of Boethius makes any reference to the\r\nsystem.[345]\r\n\r\n{87}\r\n\r\n4. The passage in question has all the appearance of an interpolation by\r\nsome scribe. Boethius is speaking of angles, in his work on geometry, when\r\nthe text suddenly changes to a discussion of classes of numbers.[346] This\r\nis followed by a chapter in explanation of the abacus,[347] in which are\r\ndescribed those numeral forms which are called _apices_ or\r\n_caracteres_.[348] The forms[349] of these characters vary in different\r\nmanuscripts, but in general are about as shown on page 88. They are\r\ncommonly written with the 9 at the left, decreasing to the unit at the\r\nright, numerous writers stating that this was because they were derived\r\nfrom Semitic sources in which the direction of writing is the opposite of\r\nour own. This practice continued until the sixteenth century.[350] The\r\nwriter then leaves the subject entirely, using the Roman numerals for the\r\nrest of his discussion, a proceeding so foreign to the method of Boethius\r\nas to be inexplicable on the hypothesis of authenticity. Why should such a\r\nscholarly writer have given them with no mention of their origin or use?\r\nEither he would have mentioned some historical interest attaching to them,\r\nor he would have used them in some discussion; he certainly would not have\r\nleft the passage as it is.\r\n\r\n{88}\r\n\r\nFORMS OF THE NUMERALS, LARGELY FROM WORKS ON THE ABACUS[351]\r\n\r\n  a[352] [Illustration]\r\n  b[353] [Illustration]\r\n  c[354] [Illustration]\r\n  d[355] [Illustration]\r\n  e[356] [Illustration]\r\n  f[357] [Illustration]\r\n  g[358] [Illustration]\r\n  h[359] [Illustration]\r\n  i[360] [Illustration]\r\n\r\n{89}\r\n\r\nSir E. Clive Bayley has added[361] a further reason for believing them\r\nspurious, namely that the 4 is not of the N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t type, but of\r\nthe Kabul form which the Arabs did not receive until 776;[362] so that it\r\nis not likely, even if the characters were known in Europe in the time of\r\nBoethius, that this particular form was recognized. It is worthy of\r\nmention, also, that in the six abacus forms from the chief manuscripts as\r\ngiven by Friedlein,[363] each contains some form of zero, which symbol\r\nprobably originated in India about this time or later. It could hardly have\r\nreached Europe so soon.\r\n\r\nAs to the fourth question, Did Boethius probably know the numerals? It\r\nseems to be a fair conclusion, according to our present evidence, that (1)\r\nBoethius might very easily have known these numerals without the zero, but,\r\n(2) there is no reliable evidence that he did know them. And just as\r\nBoethius might have come in contact with them, so any other inquiring mind\r\nmight have done so either in his time or at any time before they definitely\r\nappeared in the tenth century. These centuries, five in number, represented\r\nthe darkest of the Dark Ages, and even if these numerals were occasionally\r\nmet and studied, no trace of them would be likely to show itself in the\r\n{90} literature of the period, unless by chance it should get into the\r\nwritings of some man like Alcuin. As a matter of fact, it was not until the\r\nninth or tenth century that there is any tangible evidence of their\r\npresence in Christendom. They were probably known to merchants here and\r\nthere, but in their incomplete state they were not of sufficient importance\r\nto attract any considerable attention.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this brief survey of the evidence several conclusions seem\r\nreasonable: (1) commerce, and travel for travel's sake, never died out\r\nbetween the East and the West; (2) merchants had every opportunity of\r\nknowing, and would have been unreasonably stupid if they had not known, the\r\nelementary number systems of the peoples with whom they were trading, but\r\nthey would not have put this knowledge in permanent written form; (3)\r\nwandering scholars would have known many and strange things about the\r\npeoples they met, but they too were not, as a class, writers; (4) there is\r\nevery reason a priori for believing that the [.g]ob[=a]r numerals would\r\nhave been known to merchants, and probably to some of the wandering\r\nscholars, long before the Arabs conquered northern Africa; (5) the wonder\r\nis not that the Hindu-Arabic numerals were known about 1000 A.D., and that\r\nthey were the subject of an elaborate work in 1202 by Fibonacci, but rather\r\nthat more extended manuscript evidence of their appearance before that time\r\nhas not been found. That they were more or less known early in the Middle\r\nAges, certainly to many merchants of Christian Europe, and probably to\r\nseveral scholars, but without the zero, is hardly to be doubted. The lack\r\nof documentary evidence is not at all strange, in view of all of the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{91}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NUMERALS AMONG THE ARABS\r\n\r\nIf the numerals had their origin in India, as seems most probable, when did\r\nthe Arabs come to know of them? It is customary to say that it was due to\r\nthe influence of Mohammedanism that learning spread through Persia and\r\nArabia; and so it was, in part. But learning was already respected in these\r\ncountries long before Mohammed appeared, and commerce flourished all\r\nthrough this region. In Persia, for example, the reign of Khosr[=u]\r\nNu['s][=i]rw[=a]n,[364] the great contemporary of Justinian the law-maker,\r\nwas characterized not only by an improvement in social and economic\r\nconditions, but by the cultivation of letters. Khosr[=u] fostered learning,\r\ninviting to his court scholars from Greece, and encouraging the\r\nintroduction of culture from the West as well as from the East. At this\r\ntime Aristotle and Plato were translated, and portions of the\r\n_Hito-pad[=e]['s]a_, or Fables of Pilpay, were rendered from the Sanskrit\r\ninto Persian. All this means that some three centuries before the great\r\nintellectual ascendancy of Bagdad a similar fostering of learning was\r\ntaking place in Persia, and under pre-Mohammedan influences.\r\n\r\n{92}\r\n\r\nThe first definite trace that we have of the introduction of the Hindu\r\nsystem into Arabia dates from 773 A.D.,[365] when an Indian astronomer\r\nvisited the court of the caliph, bringing with him astronomical tables\r\nwhich at the caliph's command were translated into Arabic by\r\nAl-Faz[=a]r[=i].[366] Al-Khow[=a]razm[=i] and [H.]abash (A[h.]med ibn\r\n`Abdall[=a]h, died c. 870) based their well-known tables upon the work of\r\nAl-F[=a]zar[=i]. It may be asserted as highly probable that the numerals\r\ncame at the same time as the tables. They were certainly known a few\r\ndecades later, and before 825 A.D., about which time the original of the\r\n_Algoritmi de numero Indorum_ was written, as that work makes no pretense\r\nof being the first work to treat of the Hindu numerals.\r\n\r\nThe three writers mentioned cover the period from the end of the eighth to\r\nthe end of the ninth century. While the historians Al-Ma['s]`[=u]d[=i] and\r\nAl-B[=i]r[=u]n[=i] follow quite closely upon the men mentioned, it is well\r\nto note again the Arab writers on Hindu arithmetic, contemporary with\r\nAl-Khow[=a]razm[=i], who were mentioned in chapter I, viz. Al-Kind[=i],\r\nSened ibn `Al[=i], and Al-[S.][=u]f[=i].\r\n\r\nFor over five hundred years Arabic writers and others continued to apply to\r\nworks on arithmetic the name \"Indian.\" In the tenth century such writers\r\nare `Abdall[=a]h ibn al-[H.]asan, Ab[=u] 'l-Q[=a]sim[367] (died 987 A.D.)\r\nof Antioch, and Mo[h.]ammed ibn `Abdall[=a]h, Ab[=u] Na[s.]r[368] (c. 982),\r\nof Kalw[=a]d[=a] near Bagdad. Others of the same period or {93} earlier\r\n(since they are mentioned in the _Fihrist_,[369] 987 A.D.), who explicitly\r\nuse the word \"Hindu\" or \"Indian,\" are Sin[=a]n ibn al-Fat[h.][370] of\r\n[H.]arr[=a]n, and Ahmed ibn `Omar, al-Kar[=a]b[=i]s[=i].[371] In the\r\neleventh century come Al-B[=i]r[=u]n[=i][372] (973-1048) and `Ali ibn\r\nA[h.]med, Ab[=u] 'l-[H.]asan, Al-Nasaw[=i][373] (c. 1030). The following\r\ncentury brings similar works by Ish[=a]q ibn Y[=u]suf al-[S.]ardaf[=i][374]\r\nand Sam[=u]'[=i]l ibn Ya[h.]y[=a] ibn `Abb[=a]s al-Ma[.g]reb[=i]\r\nal-Andalus[=i][375] (c. 1174), and in the thirteenth century are\r\n`Abdallat[=i]f ibn Y[=u]suf ibn Mo[h.]ammed, Muwaffaq al-D[=i]n Ab[=u]\r\nMo[h.]ammed al-Ba[.g]d[=a]d[=i][376] (c. 1231), and Ibn al-Bann[=a].[377]\r\n\r\nThe Greek monk Maximus Planudes, writing in the first half of the\r\nfourteenth century, followed the Arabic usage in calling his work _Indian\r\nArithmetic_.[378] There were numerous other Arabic writers upon arithmetic,\r\nas that subject occupied one of the high places among the sciences, but\r\nmost of them did not feel it necessary to refer to the origin of the\r\nsymbols, the knowledge of which might well have been taken for granted.\r\n\r\n{94}\r\n\r\nOne document, cited by Woepcke,[379] is of special interest since it shows\r\nat an early period, 970 A.D., the use of the ordinary Arabic forms\r\nalongside the [.g]ob[=a]r. The title of the work is _Interesting and\r\nBeautiful Problems on Numbers_ copied by A[h.]med ibn Mo[h.]ammed ibn\r\n`Abdaljal[=i]l, Ab[=u] Sa`[=i]d, al-Sijz[=i],[380] (951-1024) from a work\r\nby a priest and physician, Na[z.][=i]f ibn Yumn,[381] al-Qass (died c.\r\n990). Suter does not mention this work of Na[z.][=i]f.\r\n\r\nThe second reason for not ascribing too much credit to the purely Arab\r\ninfluence is that the Arab by himself never showed any intellectual\r\nstrength. What took place after Mo[h.]ammed had lighted the fire in the\r\nhearts of his people was just what always takes place when different types\r\nof strong races blend,--a great renaissance in divers lines. It was seen in\r\nthe blending of such types at Miletus in the time of Thales, at Rome in the\r\ndays of the early invaders, at Alexandria when the Greek set firm foot on\r\nEgyptian soil, and we see it now when all the nations mingle their vitality\r\nin the New World. So when the Arab culture joined with the Persian, a new\r\ncivilization rose and flourished.[382] The Arab influence came not from its\r\npurity, but from its intermingling with an influence more cultured if less\r\nvirile.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this interactivity among peoples of diverse interests and\r\npowers, Mohammedanism was to the world from the eighth to the thirteenth\r\ncentury what Rome and Athens and the Italo-Hellenic influence generally had\r\n{95} been to the ancient civilization. \"If they did not possess the spirit\r\nof invention which distinguished the Greeks and the Hindus, if they did not\r\nshow the perseverance in their observations that characterized the Chinese\r\nastronomers, they at least possessed the virility of a new and victorious\r\npeople, with a desire to understand what others had accomplished, and a\r\ntaste which led them with equal ardor to the study of algebra and of\r\npoetry, of philosophy and of language.\"[383]\r\n\r\nIt was in 622 A.D. that Mo[h.]ammed fled from Mecca, and within a century\r\nfrom that time the crescent had replaced the cross in Christian Asia, in\r\nNorthern Africa, and in a goodly portion of Spain. The Arab empire was an\r\nellipse of learning with its foci at Bagdad and Cordova, and its rulers not\r\ninfrequently took pride in demanding intellectual rather than commercial\r\ntreasure as the result of conquest.[384]\r\n\r\nIt was under these influences, either pre-Mohammedan or later, that the\r\nHindu numerals found their way to the North. If they were known before\r\nMo[h.]ammed's time, the proof of this fact is now lost. This much, however,\r\nis known, that in the eighth century they were taken to Bagdad. It was\r\nearly in that century that the Mohammedans obtained their first foothold in\r\nnorthern India, thus foreshadowing an epoch of supremacy that endured with\r\nvaried fortunes until after the golden age of Akbar the Great (1542-1605)\r\nand Shah Jehan. They also conquered Khorassan and Afghanistan, so that the\r\nlearning and the commercial customs of India at once found easy {96} access\r\nto the newly-established schools and the bazaars of Mesopotamia and western\r\nAsia. The particular paths of conquest and of commerce were either by way\r\nof the Khyber Pass and through Kabul, Herat and Khorassan, or by sea\r\nthrough the strait of Ormuz to Basra (Busra) at the head of the Persian\r\nGulf, and thence to Bagdad. As a matter of fact, one form of Arabic\r\nnumerals, the one now in use by the Arabs, is attributed to the influence\r\nof Kabul, while the other, which eventually became our numerals, may very\r\nlikely have reached Arabia by the other route. It is in Bagdad,[385] D[=a]r\r\nal-Sal[=a]m--\"the Abode of Peace,\" that our special interest in the\r\nintroduction of the numerals centers. Built upon the ruins of an ancient\r\ntown by Al-Man[s.][=u]r[386] in the second half of the eighth century, it\r\nlies in one of those regions where the converging routes of trade give rise\r\nto large cities.[387] Quite as well of Bagdad as of Athens might Cardinal\r\nNewman have said:[388]\r\n\r\n\"What it lost in conveniences of approach, it gained in its neighborhood to\r\nthe traditions of the mysterious East, and in the loveliness of the region\r\nin which it lay. Hither, then, as to a sort of ideal land, where all\r\narchetypes of the great and the fair were found in substantial being, and\r\nall departments of truth explored, and all diversities of intellectual\r\npower exhibited, where taste and philosophy were majestically enthroned as\r\nin a royal court, where there was no sovereignty but that of mind, and no\r\nnobility but that of genius, where professors were {97} rulers, and princes\r\ndid homage, thither flocked continually from the very corners of the _orbis\r\nterrarum_ the many-tongued generation, just rising, or just risen into\r\nmanhood, in order to gain wisdom.\" For here it was that Al-Man[s.][=u]r and\r\nAl-M[=a]m[=u]n and H[=a]r[=u]n al-Rash[=i]d (Aaron the Just) made for a\r\ntime the world's center of intellectual activity in general and in the\r\ndomain of mathematics in particular.[389] It was just after the _Sindhind_\r\nwas brought to Bagdad that Mo[h.]ammed ibn M[=u]s[=a] al-Khow[=a]razm[=i],\r\nwhose name has already been mentioned,[390] was called to that city. He was\r\nthe most celebrated mathematician of his time, either in the East or West,\r\nwriting treatises on arithmetic, the sundial, the astrolabe, chronology,\r\ngeometry, and algebra, and giving through the Latin transliteration of his\r\nname, _algoritmi_, the name of algorism to the early arithmetics using the\r\nnew Hindu numerals.[391] Appreciating at once the value of the position\r\nsystem so recently brought from India, he wrote an arithmetic based upon\r\nthese numerals, and this was translated into Latin in the time of Adelhard\r\nof Bath (c. 1180), although possibly by his contemporary countryman Robert\r\nCestrensis.[392] This translation was found in Cambridge and was published\r\nby Boncompagni in 1857.[393]\r\n\r\nContemporary with Al-Khow[=a]razm[=i], and working also under\r\nAl-M[=a]m[=u]n, was a Jewish astronomer, Ab[=u] 'l-[T.]eiyib, {98} Sened\r\nibn `Al[=i], who is said to have adopted the Mohammedan religion at the\r\ncaliph's request. He also wrote a work on Hindu arithmetic,[394] so that\r\nthe subject must have been attracting considerable attention at that time.\r\nIndeed, the struggle to have the Hindu numerals replace the Arabic did not\r\ncease for a long time thereafter. `Al[=i] ibn A[h.]med al-Nasaw[=i], in his\r\narithmetic of c. 1025, tells us that the symbolism of number was still\r\nunsettled in his day, although most people preferred the strictly Arabic\r\nforms.[395]\r\n\r\nWe thus have the numerals in Arabia, in two forms: one the form now used\r\nthere, and the other the one used by Al-Khow[=a]razm[=i]. The question then\r\nremains, how did this second form find its way into Europe? and this\r\nquestion will be considered in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{99}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE DEFINITE INTRODUCTION OF THE NUMERALS INTO EUROPE\r\n\r\nIt being doubtful whether Boethius ever knew the Hindu numeral forms,\r\ncertainly without the zero in any case, it becomes necessary now to\r\nconsider the question of their definite introduction into Europe. From what\r\nhas been said of the trade relations between the East and the West, and of\r\nthe probability that it was the trader rather than the scholar who carried\r\nthese numerals from their original habitat to various commercial centers,\r\nit is evident that we shall never know when they first made their\r\ninconspicuous entrance into Europe. Curious customs from the East and from\r\nthe tropics,--concerning games, social peculiarities, oddities of dress,\r\nand the like,--are continually being related by sailors and traders in\r\ntheir resorts in New York, London, Hamburg, and Rotterdam to-day, customs\r\nthat no scholar has yet described in print and that may not become known\r\nfor many years, if ever. And if this be so now, how much more would it have\r\nbeen true a thousand years before the invention of printing, when learning\r\nwas at its lowest ebb. It was at this period of low esteem of culture that\r\nthe Hindu numerals undoubtedly made their first appearance in Europe.\r\n\r\nThere were many opportunities for such knowledge to reach Spain and Italy.\r\nIn the first place the Moors went into Spain as helpers of a claimant of\r\nthe throne, and {100} remained as conquerors. The power of the Goths, who\r\nhad held Spain for three centuries, was shattered at the battle of Jerez de\r\nla Frontera in 711, and almost immediately the Moors became masters of\r\nSpain and so remained for five hundred years, and masters of Granada for a\r\nmuch longer period. Until 850 the Christians were absolutely free as to\r\nreligion and as to holding political office, so that priests and monks were\r\nnot infrequently skilled both in Latin and Arabic, acting as official\r\ntranslators, and naturally reporting directly or indirectly to Rome. There\r\nwas indeed at this time a complaint that Christian youths cultivated too\r\nassiduously a love for the literature of the Saracen, and married too\r\nfrequently the daughters of the infidel.[396] It is true that this happy\r\nstate of affairs was not permanent, but while it lasted the learning and\r\nthe customs of the East must have become more or less the property of\r\nChristian Spain. At this time the [.g]ob[=a]r numerals were probably in\r\nthat country, and these may well have made their way into Europe from the\r\nschools of Cordova, Granada, and Toledo.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there was abundant opportunity for the numerals of the East to\r\nreach Europe through the journeys of travelers and ambassadors. It was from\r\nthe records of Suleim[=a]n the Merchant, a well-known Arab trader of the\r\nninth century, that part of the story of Sindb[=a]d the Sailor was\r\ntaken.[397] Such a merchant would have been particularly likely to know the\r\nnumerals of the people whom he met, and he is a type of man that may well\r\nhave taken such symbols to European markets. A little later, {101} Ab[=u]\r\n'l-[H.]asan `Al[=i] al-Mas`[=u]d[=i] (d. 956) of Bagdad traveled to the\r\nChina Sea on the east, at least as far south as Zanzibar, and to the\r\nAtlantic on the west,[398] and he speaks of the nine figures with which the\r\nHindus reckoned.[399]\r\n\r\nThere was also a Bagdad merchant, one Ab[=u] 'l-Q[=a]sim `Obeidall[=a]h ibn\r\nA[h.]med, better known by his Persian name Ibn Khord[=a][d.]beh,[400] who\r\nwrote about 850 A.D. a work entitled _Book of Roads and Provinces_[401] in\r\nwhich the following graphic account appears:[402] \"The Jewish merchants\r\nspeak Persian, Roman (Greek and Latin), Arabic, French, Spanish, and\r\nSlavic. They travel from the West to the East, and from the East to the\r\nWest, sometimes by land, sometimes by sea. They take ship from France on\r\nthe Western Sea, and they voyage to Farama (near the ruins of the ancient\r\nPelusium); there they transfer their goods to caravans and go by land to\r\nColzom (on the Red Sea). They there reëmbark on the Oriental (Red) Sea and\r\ngo to Hejaz and to Jiddah, and thence to the Sind, India, and China.\r\nReturning, they bring back the products of the oriental lands.... These\r\njourneys are also made by land. The merchants, leaving France and Spain,\r\ncross to Tangier and thence pass through the African provinces and Egypt.\r\nThey then go to Ramleh, visit Damascus, Kufa, Bagdad, and Basra, penetrate\r\ninto Ahwaz, Fars, Kerman, Sind, and thus reach India and China.\" Such\r\ntravelers, about 900 A.D., must necessarily have spread abroad a knowledge\r\nof all number {102} systems used in recording prices or in the computations\r\nof the market. There is an interesting witness to this movement, a\r\ncruciform brooch now in the British Museum. It is English, certainly as\r\nearly as the eleventh century, but it is inlaid with a piece of paste on\r\nwhich is the Mohammedan inscription, in Kufic characters, \"There is no God\r\nbut God.\" How did such an inscription find its way, perhaps in the time of\r\nAlcuin of York, to England? And if these Kufic characters reached there,\r\nthen why not the numeral forms as well?\r\n\r\nEven in literature of the better class there appears now and then some\r\nstray proof of the important fact that the great trade routes to the far\r\nEast were never closed for long, and that the customs and marks of trade\r\nendured from generation to generation. The _Gulist[=a]n_ of the Persian\r\npoet Sa`d[=i][403] contains such a passage:\r\n\r\n\"I met a merchant who owned one hundred and forty camels, and fifty slaves\r\nand porters.... He answered to me: 'I want to carry sulphur of Persia to\r\nChina, which in that country, as I hear, bears a high price; and thence to\r\ntake Chinese ware to Roum; and from Roum to load up with brocades for Hind;\r\nand so to trade Indian steel (_pûlab_) to Halib. From Halib I will convey\r\nits glass to Yeman, and carry the painted cloths of Yeman back to\r\nPersia.'\"[404] On the other hand, these men were not of the learned class,\r\nnor would they preserve in treatises any knowledge that they might have,\r\nalthough this knowledge would occasionally reach the ears of the learned as\r\nbits of curious information.\r\n\r\n{103}\r\n\r\nThere were also ambassadors passing back and forth from time to time,\r\nbetween the East and the West, and in particular during the period when\r\nthese numerals probably began to enter Europe. Thus Charlemagne (c. 800)\r\nsent emissaries to Bagdad just at the time of the opening of the\r\nmathematical activity there.[405] And with such ambassadors must have gone\r\nthe adventurous scholar, inspired, as Alcuin says of Archbishop Albert of\r\nYork (766-780),[406] to seek the learning of other lands. Furthermore, the\r\nNestorian communities, established in Eastern Asia and in India at this\r\ntime, were favored both by the Persians and by their Mohammedan conquerors.\r\nThe Nestorian Patriarch of Syria, Timotheus (778-820), sent missionaries\r\nboth to India and to China, and a bishop was appointed for the latter\r\nfield. Ibn Wahab, who traveled to China in the ninth century, found images\r\nof Christ and the apostles in the Emperor's court.[407] Such a learned body\r\nof men, knowing intimately the countries in which they labored, could\r\nhardly have failed to make strange customs known as they returned to their\r\nhome stations. Then, too, in Alfred's time (849-901) emissaries went {104}\r\nfrom England as far as India,[408] and generally in the Middle Ages\r\ngroceries came to Europe from Asia as now they come from the colonies and\r\nfrom America. Syria, Asia Minor, and Cyprus furnished sugar and wool, and\r\nIndia yielded her perfumes and spices, while rich tapestries for the courts\r\nand the wealthy burghers came from Persia and from China.[409] Even in the\r\ntime of Justinian (c. 550) there seems to have been a silk trade with\r\nChina, which country in turn carried on commerce with Ceylon,[410] and\r\nreached out to Turkestan where other merchants transmitted the Eastern\r\nproducts westward. In the seventh century there was a well-defined commerce\r\nbetween Persia and India, as well as between Persia and\r\nConstantinople.[411] The Byzantine _commerciarii_ were stationed at the\r\noutposts not merely as customs officers but as government purchasing\r\nagents.[412]\r\n\r\nOccasionally there went along these routes of trade men of real learning,\r\nand such would surely have carried the knowledge of many customs back and\r\nforth. Thus at a period when the numerals are known to have been partly\r\nunderstood in Italy, at the opening of the eleventh century, one\r\nConstantine, an African, traveled from Italy through a great part of Africa\r\nand Asia, even on to India, for the purpose of learning the sciences of the\r\nOrient. He spent thirty-nine years in travel, having been hospitably\r\nreceived in Babylon, and upon his return he was welcomed with great honor\r\nat Salerno.[413]\r\n\r\nA very interesting illustration of this intercourse also appears in the\r\ntenth century, when the son of Otto I {105} (936-973) married a princess\r\nfrom Constantinople. This monarch was in touch with the Moors of Spain and\r\ninvited to his court numerous scholars from abroad,[414] and his\r\nintercourse with the East as well as the West must have brought together\r\nmuch of the learning of each.\r\n\r\nAnother powerful means for the circulation of mysticism and philosophy, and\r\nmore or less of culture, took its start just before the conversion of\r\nConstantine (c. 312), in the form of Christian pilgrim travel. This was a\r\nfeature peculiar to the zealots of early Christianity, found in only a\r\nslight degree among their Jewish predecessors in the annual pilgrimage to\r\nJerusalem, and almost wholly wanting in other pre-Christian peoples. Chief\r\namong these early pilgrims were the two Placentians, John and Antonine the\r\nElder (c. 303), who, in their wanderings to Jerusalem, seem to have started\r\na movement which culminated centuries later in the crusades.[415] In 333 a\r\nBordeaux pilgrim compiled the first Christian guide-book, the _Itinerary\r\nfrom Bordeaux to Jerusalem_,[416] and from this time on the holy pilgrimage\r\nnever entirely ceased.\r\n\r\nStill another certain route for the entrance of the numerals into Christian\r\nEurope was through the pillaging and trading carried on by the Arabs on the\r\nnorthern shores of the Mediterranean. As early as 652 A.D., in the\r\nthirtieth year of the Hejira, the Mohammedans descended upon the shores of\r\nSicily and took much spoil. Hardly had the wretched Constans given place to\r\nthe {106} young Constantine IV when they again attacked the island and\r\nplundered ancient Syracuse. Again in 827, under Asad, they ravaged the\r\ncoasts. Although at this time they failed to conquer Syracuse, they soon\r\nheld a good part of the island, and a little later they successfully\r\nbesieged the city. Before Syracuse fell, however, they had plundered the\r\nshores of Italy, even to the walls of Rome itself; and had not Leo IV, in\r\n849, repaired the neglected fortifications, the effects of the Moslem raid\r\nof that year might have been very far-reaching. Ibn Khord[=a][d.]beh, who\r\nleft Bagdad in the latter part of the ninth century, gives a picture of the\r\ngreat commercial activity at that time in the Saracen city of Palermo. In\r\nthis same century they had established themselves in Piedmont, and in 906\r\nthey pillaged Turin.[417] On the Sorrento peninsula the traveler who climbs\r\nthe hill to the beautiful Ravello sees still several traces of the Arab\r\narchitecture, reminding him of the fact that about 900 A.D. Amalfi was a\r\ncommercial center of the Moors.[418] Not only at this time, but even a\r\ncentury earlier, the artists of northern India sold their wares at such\r\ncenters, and in the courts both of H[=a]r[=u]n al-Rash[=i]d and of\r\nCharlemagne.[419] Thus the Arabs dominated the Mediterranean Sea long\r\nbefore Venice\r\n\r\n              \"held the gorgeous East in fee\r\n  And was the safeguard of the West,\"\r\n\r\nand long before Genoa had become her powerful rival.[420]\r\n\r\n{107}\r\n\r\nOnly a little later than this the brothers Nicolo and Maffeo Polo entered\r\nupon their famous wanderings.[421] Leaving Constantinople in 1260, they\r\nwent by the Sea of Azov to Bokhara, and thence to the court of Kublai Khan,\r\npenetrating China, and returning by way of Acre in 1269 with a commission\r\nwhich required them to go back to China two years later. This time they\r\ntook with them Nicolo's son Marco, the historian of the journey, and went\r\nacross the plateau of Pamir; they spent about twenty years in China, and\r\ncame back by sea from China to Persia.\r\n\r\nThe ventures of the Poli were not long unique, however: the thirteenth\r\ncentury had not closed before Roman missionaries and the merchant Petrus de\r\nLucolongo had penetrated China. Before 1350 the company of missionaries was\r\nlarge, converts were numerous, churches and Franciscan convents had been\r\norganized in the East, travelers were appealing for the truth of their\r\naccounts to the \"many\" persons in Venice who had been in China,\r\nTsuan-chau-fu had a European merchant community, and Italian trade and\r\ntravel to China was a thing that occupied two chapters of a commercial\r\nhandbook.[422]\r\n\r\n{108}\r\n\r\nIt is therefore reasonable to conclude that in the Middle Ages, as in the\r\ntime of Boethius, it was a simple matter for any inquiring scholar to\r\nbecome acquainted with such numerals of the Orient as merchants may have\r\nused for warehouse or price marks. And the fact that Gerbert seems to have\r\nknown only the forms of the simplest of these, not comprehending their full\r\nsignificance, seems to prove that he picked them up in just this way.\r\n\r\nEven if Gerbert did not bring his knowledge of the Oriental numerals from\r\nSpain, he may easily have obtained them from the marks on merchant's goods,\r\nhad he been so inclined. Such knowledge was probably obtainable in various\r\nparts of Italy, though as parts of mere mercantile knowledge the forms\r\nmight soon have been lost, it needing the pen of the scholar to preserve\r\nthem. Trade at this time was not stagnant. During the eleventh and twelfth\r\ncenturies the Slavs, for example, had very great commercial interests,\r\ntheir trade reaching to Kiev and Novgorod, and thence to the East.\r\nConstantinople was a great clearing-house of commerce with the Orient,[423]\r\nand the Byzantine merchants must have been entirely familiar with the\r\nvarious numerals of the Eastern peoples. In the eleventh century the\r\nItalian town of Amalfi established a factory[424] in Constantinople, and\r\nhad trade relations with Antioch and Egypt. Venice, as early as the ninth\r\ncentury, had a valuable trade with Syria and Cairo.[425] Fifty years after\r\nGerbert died, in the time of Cnut, the Dane and the Norwegian pushed their\r\ncommerce far beyond the northern seas, both by caravans through Russia to\r\nthe Orient, and by their venturesome barks which {109} sailed through the\r\nStrait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean.[426] Only a little later,\r\nprobably before 1200 A.D., a clerk in the service of Thomas à Becket,\r\npresent at the latter's death, wrote a life of the martyr, to which\r\n(fortunately for our purposes) he prefixed a brief eulogy of the city of\r\nLondon.[427] This clerk, William Fitz Stephen by name, thus speaks of the\r\nBritish capital:\r\n\r\n  Aurum mittit Arabs: species et thura Sabæus:\r\n  Arma Sythes: oleum palmarum divite sylva\r\n  Pingue solum Babylon: Nilus lapides pretiosos:\r\n  Norwegi, Russi, varium grisum, sabdinas:\r\n  Seres, purpureas vestes: Galli, sua vina.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as a matter of fact, the Arabs had no gold to send, and the\r\nScythians no arms, and Egypt no precious stones save only the turquoise,\r\nthe Chinese (_Seres_) may have sent their purple vestments, and the north\r\nher sables and other furs, and France her wines. At any rate the verses\r\nshow very clearly an extensive foreign trade.\r\n\r\nThen there were the Crusades, which in these times brought the East in\r\ntouch with the West. The spirit of the Orient showed itself in the songs of\r\nthe troubadours, and the _baudekin_,[428] the canopy of Bagdad,[429] became\r\ncommon in the churches of Italy. In Sicily and in Venice the textile\r\nindustries of the East found place, and made their way even to the\r\nScandinavian peninsula.[430]\r\n\r\nWe therefore have this state of affairs: There was abundant intercourse\r\nbetween the East and West for {110} some centuries before the Hindu\r\nnumerals appear in any manuscripts in Christian Europe. The numerals must\r\nof necessity have been known to many traders in a country like Italy at\r\nleast as early as the ninth century, and probably even earlier, but there\r\nwas no reason for preserving them in treatises. Therefore when a man like\r\nGerbert made them known to the scholarly circles, he was merely describing\r\nwhat had been familiar in a small way to many people in a different walk of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nSince Gerbert[431] was for a long time thought to have been the one to\r\nintroduce the numerals into Italy,[432] a brief sketch of this unique\r\ncharacter is proper. Born of humble parents,[433] this remarkable man\r\nbecame the counselor and companion of kings, and finally wore the papal\r\ntiara as Sylvester II, from 999 until his death in 1003.[434] He was early\r\nbrought under the influence of the monks at Aurillac, and particularly of\r\nRaimund, who had been a pupil of Odo of Cluny, and there in due time he\r\nhimself took holy orders. He visited Spain in about 967 in company with\r\nCount Borel,[435] remaining there three years, {111} and studying under\r\nBishop Hatto of Vich,[436] a city in the province of Barcelona,[437] then\r\nentirely under Christian rule. Indeed, all of Gerbert's testimony is as to\r\nthe influence of the Christian civilization upon his education. Thus he\r\nspeaks often of his study of Boethius,[438] so that if the latter knew the\r\nnumerals Gerbert would have learned them from him.[439] If Gerbert had\r\nstudied in any Moorish schools he would, under the decree of the emir\r\nHish[=a]m (787-822), have been obliged to know Arabic, which would have\r\ntaken most of his three years in Spain, and of which study we have not the\r\nslightest hint in any of his letters.[440] On the other hand, Barcelona was\r\nthe only Christian province in immediate touch with the Moorish\r\ncivilization at that time.[441] Furthermore we know that earlier in the\r\nsame century King Alonzo of Asturias (d. 910) confided the education of his\r\nson Ordoño to the Arab scholars of the court of the {112} w[=a]l[=i] of\r\nSaragossa,[442] so that there was more or less of friendly relation between\r\nChristian and Moor.\r\n\r\nAfter his three years in Spain, Gerbert went to Italy, about 970, where he\r\nmet Pope John XIII, being by him presented to the emperor Otto I. Two years\r\nlater (972), at the emperor's request, he went to Rheims, where he studied\r\nphilosophy, assisting to make of that place an educational center; and in\r\n983 he became abbot at Bobbio. The next year he returned to Rheims, and\r\nbecame archbishop of that diocese in 991. For political reasons he returned\r\nto Italy in 996, became archbishop of Ravenna in 998, and the following\r\nyear was elected to the papal chair. Far ahead of his age in wisdom, he\r\nsuffered as many such scholars have even in times not so remote by being\r\naccused of heresy and witchcraft. As late as 1522, in a biography published\r\nat Venice, it is related that by black art he attained the papacy, after\r\nhaving given his soul to the devil.[443] Gerbert was, however, interested\r\nin astrology,[444] although this was merely the astronomy of that time and\r\nwas such a science as any learned man would wish to know, even as to-day we\r\nwish to be reasonably familiar with physics and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThat Gerbert and his pupils knew the [.g]ob[=a]r numerals is a fact no\r\nlonger open to controversy.[445] Bernelinus and Richer[446] call them by\r\nthe well-known name of {113} \"caracteres,\" a word used by Radulph of Laon\r\nin the same sense a century later.[447] It is probable that Gerbert was the\r\nfirst to describe these [.g]ob[=a]r numerals in any scientific way in\r\nChristian Europe, but without the zero. If he knew the latter he certainly\r\ndid not understand its use.[448]\r\n\r\nThe question still to be settled is as to where he found these numerals.\r\nThat he did not bring them from Spain is the opinion of a number of careful\r\ninvestigators.[449] This is thought to be the more probable because most of\r\nthe men who made Spain famous for learning lived after Gerbert was there.\r\nSuch were Ibn S[=i]n[=a] (Avicenna) who lived at the beginning, and Gerber\r\nof Seville who flourished in the middle, of the eleventh century, and\r\nAb[=u] Roshd (Averroës) who lived at the end of the twelfth.[450] Others\r\nhold that his proximity to {114} the Arabs for three years makes it\r\nprobable that he assimilated some of their learning, in spite of the fact\r\nthat the lines between Christian and Moor at that time were sharply\r\ndrawn.[451] Writers fail, however, to recognize that a commercial numeral\r\nsystem would have been more likely to be made known by merchants than by\r\nscholars. The itinerant peddler knew no forbidden pale in Spain, any more\r\nthan he has known one in other lands. If the [.g]ob[=a]r numerals were used\r\nfor marking wares or keeping simple accounts, it was he who would have\r\nknown them, and who would have been the one rather than any Arab scholar to\r\nbring them to the inquiring mind of the young French monk. The facts that\r\nGerbert knew them only imperfectly, that he used them solely for\r\ncalculations, and that the forms are evidently like the Spanish\r\n[.g]ob[=a]r, make it all the more probable that it was through the small\r\ntradesman of the Moors that this versatile scholar derived his knowledge.\r\nMoreover the part of the geometry bearing his name, and that seems\r\nunquestionably his, shows the Arab influence, proving that he at least came\r\ninto contact with the transplanted Oriental learning, even though\r\nimperfectly.[452] There was also the persistent Jewish merchant trading\r\nwith both peoples then as now, always alive to the acquiring of useful\r\nknowledge, and it would be very natural for a man like Gerbert to welcome\r\nlearning from such a source.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the two leading sources of information as to the life of\r\nGerbert reveal practically nothing to show that he came within the Moorish\r\nsphere of influence during his sojourn in Spain. These sources {115} are\r\nhis letters and the history written by Richer. Gerbert was a master of the\r\nepistolary art, and his exalted position led to the preservation of his\r\nletters to a degree that would not have been vouchsafed even by their\r\nclassic excellence.[453] Richer was a monk at St. Remi de Rheims, and was\r\ndoubtless a pupil of Gerbert. The latter, when archbishop of Rheims, asked\r\nRicher to write a history of his times, and this was done. The work lay in\r\nmanuscript, entirely forgotten until Pertz discovered it at Bamberg in\r\n1833.[454] The work is dedicated to Gerbert as archbishop of Rheims,[455]\r\nand would assuredly have testified to such efforts as he may have made to\r\nsecure the learning of the Moors.\r\n\r\nNow it is a fact that neither the letters nor this history makes any\r\nstatement as to Gerbert's contact with the Saracens. The letters do not\r\nspeak of the Moors, of the Arab numerals, nor of Cordova. Spain is not\r\nreferred to by that name, and only one Spanish scholar is mentioned. In one\r\nof his letters he speaks of Joseph Ispanus,[456] or Joseph Sapiens, but who\r\nthis Joseph the Wise of Spain may have been we do not know. Possibly {116}\r\nit was he who contributed the morsel of knowledge so imperfectly\r\nassimilated by the young French monk.[457] Within a few years after\r\nGerbert's visit two young Spanish monks of lesser fame, and doubtless with\r\nnot that keen interest in mathematical matters which Gerbert had, regarded\r\nthe apparently slight knowledge which they had of the Hindu numeral forms\r\nas worthy of somewhat permanent record[458] in manuscripts which they were\r\ntranscribing. The fact that such knowledge had penetrated to their modest\r\ncloisters in northern Spain--the one Albelda or Albaida--indicates that it\r\nwas rather widely diffused.\r\n\r\nGerbert's treatise _Libellus de numerorum divisione_[459] is characterized\r\nby Chasles as \"one of the most obscure documents in the history of\r\nscience.\"[460] The most complete information in regard to this and the\r\nother mathematical works of Gerbert is given by Bubnov,[461] who considers\r\nthis work to be genuine.[462]\r\n\r\n{117}\r\n\r\nSo little did Gerbert appreciate these numerals that in his works known as\r\nthe _Regula de abaco computi_ and the _Libellus_ he makes no use of them at\r\nall, employing only the Roman forms.[463] Nevertheless Bernelinus[464]\r\nrefers to the nine [.g]ob[=a]r characters.[465] These Gerbert had marked on\r\na thousand _jetons_ or counters,[466] using the latter on an abacus which\r\nhe had a sign-maker prepare for him.[467] Instead of putting eight counters\r\nin say the tens' column, Gerbert would put a single counter marked 8, and\r\nso for the other places, leaving the column empty where we would place a\r\nzero, but where he, lacking the zero, had no counter to place. These\r\ncounters he possibly called _caracteres_, a name which adhered also to the\r\nfigures themselves. It is an interesting speculation to consider whether\r\nthese _apices_, as they are called in the Boethius interpolations, were in\r\nany way suggested by those Roman jetons generally known in numismatics as\r\n_tesserae_, and bearing the figures I-XVI, the sixteen referring to the\r\nnumber of _assi_ in a _sestertius_.[468] The {118} name _apices_ adhered to\r\nthe Hindu-Arabic numerals until the sixteenth century.[469]\r\n\r\nTo the figures on the _apices_ were given the names Igin, andras, ormis,\r\narbas, quimas, calctis or caltis, zenis, temenias, celentis, sipos,[470]\r\nthe origin and meaning of which still remain a mystery. The Semitic origin\r\nof several of the words seems probable. _Wahud_, _thaneine_, {119}\r\n_thalata_, _arba_, _kumsa_, _setta_, _sebba_, _timinia_, _taseud_ are given\r\nby the Rev. R. Patrick[471] as the names, in an Arabic dialect used in\r\nMorocco, for the numerals from one to nine. Of these the words for four,\r\nfive, and eight are strikingly like those given above.\r\n\r\nThe name _apices_ was not, however, a common one in later times. _Notae_\r\nwas more often used, and it finally gave the name to notation.[472] Still\r\nmore common were the names _figures_, _ciphers_, _signs_, _elements_, and\r\n_characters_.[473]\r\n\r\nSo little effect did the teachings of Gerbert have in making known the new\r\nnumerals, that O'Creat, who lived a century later, a friend and pupil of\r\nAdelhard {120} of Bath, used the zero with the Roman characters, in\r\ncontrast to Gerbert's use of the [.g]ob[=a]r forms without the zero.[474]\r\nO'Creat uses three forms for zero, o, [=o], and [Greek: t], as in Maximus\r\nPlanudes. With this use of the zero goes, naturally, a place value, for he\r\nwrites III III for 33, ICCOO and I. II. [tau]. [tau] for 1200,\r\nI. O. VIII. IX for 1089, and I. IIII. IIII. [tau][tau][tau][tau] for the\r\nsquare of 1200.\r\n\r\nThe period from the time of Gerbert until after the appearance of\r\nLeonardo's monumental work may be called the period of the abacists. Even\r\nfor many years after the appearance early in the twelfth century of the\r\nbooks explaining the Hindu art of reckoning, there was strife between the\r\nabacists, the advocates of the abacus, and the algorists, those who favored\r\nthe new numerals. The words _cifra_ and _algorismus cifra_ were used with a\r\nsomewhat derisive significance, indicative of absolute uselessness, as\r\nindeed the zero is useless on an abacus in which the value of any unit is\r\ngiven by the column which it occupies.[475] So Gautier de Coincy\r\n(1177-1236) in a work on the miracles of Mary says:\r\n\r\n  A horned beast, a sheep,\r\n  An algorismus-cipher,\r\n  Is a priest, who on such a feast day\r\n  Does not celebrate the holy Mother.[476]\r\n\r\nSo the abacus held the field for a long time, even against the new algorism\r\nemploying the new numerals. {121} Geoffrey Chaucer[477] describes in _The\r\nMiller's Tale_ the clerk with\r\n\r\n \"His Almageste and bokes grete and smale,\r\n  His astrelabie, longinge for his art,\r\n  His augrim-stones layen faire apart\r\n  On shelves couched at his beddes heed.\"\r\n\r\nSo, too, in Chaucer's explanation of the astrolabe,[478] written for his\r\nson Lewis, the number of degrees is expressed on the instrument in\r\nHindu-Arabic numerals: \"Over the whiche degrees ther ben noumbres of\r\naugrim, that devyden thilke same degrees fro fyve to fyve,\" and \"... the\r\nnombres ... ben writen in augrim,\" meaning in the way of the algorism.\r\nThomas Usk about 1387 writes:[479] \"a sypher in augrim have no might in\r\nsignification of it-selve, yet he yeveth power in signification to other.\"\r\nSo slow and so painful is the assimilation of new ideas.\r\n\r\nBernelinus[480] states that the abacus is a well-polished board (or table),\r\nwhich is covered with blue sand and used by geometers in drawing\r\ngeometrical figures. We have previously mentioned the fact that the Hindus\r\nalso performed mathematical computations in the sand, although there is no\r\nevidence to show that they had any column abacus.[481] For the purposes of\r\ncomputation, Bernelinus continues, the board is divided into thirty\r\nvertical columns, three of which are reserved for fractions. Beginning with\r\nthe units columns, each set of {122} three columns (_lineae_ is the word\r\nwhich Bernelinus uses) is grouped together by a semicircular arc placed\r\nabove them, while a smaller arc is placed over the units column and another\r\njoins the tens and hundreds columns. Thus arose the designation _arcus\r\npictagore_[482] or sometimes simply _arcus_.[483] The operations of\r\naddition, subtraction, and multiplication upon this form of the abacus\r\nrequired little explanation, although they were rather extensively treated,\r\nespecially the multiplication of different orders of numbers. But the\r\noperation of division was effected with some difficulty. For the\r\nexplanation of the method of division by the use of the complementary\r\ndifference,[484] long the stumbling-block in the way of the medieval\r\narithmetician, the reader is referred to works on the history of\r\nmathematics[485] and to works relating particularly to the abacus.[486]\r\n\r\nAmong the writers on the subject may be mentioned Abbo[487] of Fleury (c.\r\n970), Heriger[488] of Lobbes or Laubach {123} (c. 950-1007), and Hermannus\r\nContractus[489] (1013-1054), all of whom employed only the Roman numerals.\r\nSimilarly Adelhard of Bath (c. 1130), in his work _Regulae Abaci_,[490]\r\ngives no reference to the new numerals, although it is certain that he knew\r\nthem. Other writers on the abacus who used some form of Hindu numerals were\r\nGerland[491] (first half of twelfth century) and Turchill[492] (c. 1200).\r\nFor the forms used at this period the reader is referred to the plate on\r\npage 88.\r\n\r\nAfter Gerbert's death, little by little the scholars of Europe came to know\r\nthe new figures, chiefly through the introduction of Arab learning. The\r\nDark Ages had passed, although arithmetic did not find another advocate as\r\nprominent as Gerbert for two centuries. Speaking of this great revival,\r\nRaoul Glaber[493] (985-c. 1046), a monk of the great Benedictine abbey of\r\nCluny, of the eleventh century, says: \"It was as though the world had\r\narisen and tossed aside the worn-out garments of ancient time, and wished\r\nto apparel itself in a white robe of churches.\" And with this activity in\r\nreligion came a corresponding interest in other lines. Algorisms began to\r\nappear, and knowledge from the outside world found {124} interested\r\nlisteners. Another Raoul, or Radulph, to whom we have referred as Radulph\r\nof Laon,[494] a teacher in the cloister school of his city, and the brother\r\nof Anselm of Laon[495] the celebrated theologian, wrote a treatise on\r\nmusic, extant but unpublished, and an arithmetic which Nagl first published\r\nin 1890.[496] The latter work, preserved to us in a parchment manuscript of\r\nseventy-seven leaves, contains a curious mixture of Roman and [.g]ob[=a]r\r\nnumerals, the former for expressing large results, the latter for practical\r\ncalculation. These [.g]ob[=a]r \"caracteres\" include the sipos (zero),\r\n[Symbol], of which, however, Radulph did not know the full significance;\r\nshowing that at the opening of the twelfth century the system was still\r\nuncertain in its status in the church schools of central France.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the words _algorismus_ and _cifra_ were coming into\r\ngeneral use even in non-mathematical literature. Jordan [497] cites\r\nnumerous instances of such use from the works of Alanus ab Insulis[498]\r\n(Alain de Lille), Gautier de Coincy (1177-1236), and others.\r\n\r\nAnother contributor to arithmetic during this interesting period was a\r\nprominent Spanish Jew called variously John of Luna, John of Seville,\r\nJohannes Hispalensis, Johannes Toletanus, and Johannes Hispanensis de\r\nLuna.[499] {125} His date is rather closely fixed by the fact that he\r\ndedicated a work to Raimund who was archbishop of Toledo between 1130 and\r\n1150.[500] His interests were chiefly in the translation of Arabic works,\r\nespecially such as bore upon the Aristotelian philosophy. From the\r\nstandpoint of arithmetic, however, the chief interest centers about a\r\nmanuscript entitled _Joannis Hispalensis liber Algorismi de Practica\r\nArismetrice_ which Boncompagni found in what is now the _Bibliothèque\r\nnationale_ at Paris. Although this distinctly lays claim to being\r\nAl-Khow[=a]razm[=i]'s work,[501] the evidence is altogether against the\r\nstatement,[502] but the book is quite as valuable, since it represents the\r\nknowledge of the time in which it was written. It relates to the operations\r\nwith integers and sexagesimal fractions, including roots, and contains no\r\napplications.[503]\r\n\r\nContemporary with John of Luna, and also living in Toledo, was Gherard of\r\nCremona,[504] who has sometimes been identified, but erroneously, with\r\nGernardus,[505] the {126} author of a work on algorism. He was a physician,\r\nan astronomer, and a mathematician, translating from the Arabic both in\r\nItaly and in Spain. In arithmetic he was influential in spreading the ideas\r\nof algorism.\r\n\r\nFour Englishmen--Adelhard of Bath (c. 1130), Robert of Chester (Robertus\r\nCestrensis, c. 1143), William Shelley, and Daniel Morley (1180)--are\r\nknown[506] to have journeyed to Spain in the twelfth century for the\r\npurpose of studying mathematics and Arabic. Adelhard of Bath made\r\ntranslations from Arabic into Latin of Al-Khow[=a]razm[=i]'s astronomical\r\ntables[507] and of Euclid's Elements,[508] while Robert of Chester is known\r\nas the translator of Al-Khow[=a]razm[=i]'s algebra.[509] There is no reason\r\nto doubt that all of these men, and others, were familiar with the numerals\r\nwhich the Arabs were using.\r\n\r\nThe earliest trace we have of computation with Hindu numerals in Germany is\r\nin an Algorismus of 1143, now in the Hofbibliothek in Vienna.[510] It is\r\nbound in with a {127} _Computus_ by the same author and bearing the date\r\ngiven. It contains chapters \"De additione,\" \"De diminutione,\" \"De\r\nmediatione,\" \"De divisione,\" and part of a chapter on multiplication. The\r\nnumerals are in the usual medieval forms except the 2 which, as will be\r\nseen from the illustration,[511] is somewhat different, and the 3, which\r\ntakes the peculiar shape [Symbol], a form characteristic of the twelfth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIt was about the same time that the _Sefer ha-Mispar_,[512] the Book of\r\nNumber, appeared in the Hebrew language. The author, Rabbi Abraham ibn Meïr\r\nibn Ezra,[513] was born in Toledo (c. 1092). In 1139 he went to Egypt,\r\nPalestine, and the Orient, spending also some years in Italy. Later he\r\nlived in southern France and in England. He died in 1167. The probability\r\nis that he acquired his knowledge of the Hindu arithmetic[514] in his\r\nnative town of Toledo, but it is also likely that the knowledge of other\r\nsystems which he acquired on travels increased his appreciation of this\r\none. We have mentioned the fact that he used the first letters of the\r\nHebrew alphabet, [Hebrew: A B G D H W Z CH T`], for the numerals 9 8 7 6 5\r\n4 3 2 1, and a circle for the zero. The quotation in the note given below\r\nshows that he knew of the Hindu origin; but in his manuscript, although he\r\nset down the Hindu forms, he used the above nine Hebrew letters with place\r\nvalue for all computations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{128}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE SPREAD OF THE NUMERALS IN EUROPE\r\n\r\nOf all the medieval writers, probably the one most influential in\r\nintroducing the new numerals to the scholars of Europe was Leonardo\r\nFibonacci, of Pisa.[515] This remarkable man, the most noteworthy\r\nmathematical genius of the Middle Ages, was born at Pisa about 1175.[516]\r\n\r\nThe traveler of to-day may cross the Via Fibonacci on his way to the Campo\r\nSanto, and there he may see at the end of the long corridor, across the\r\nquadrangle, the statue of Leonardo in scholars garb. Few towns have honored\r\na mathematician more, and few mathematicians have so distinctly honored\r\ntheir birthplace. Leonardo was born in the golden age of this city, the\r\nperiod of its commercial, religious, and intellectual prosperity.[517]\r\n{129} Situated practically at the mouth of the Arno, Pisa formed with Genoa\r\nand Venice the trio of the greatest commercial centers of Italy at the\r\nopening of the thirteenth century. Even before Venice had captured the\r\nLevantine trade, Pisa had close relations with the East. An old Latin\r\nchronicle relates that in 1005 \"Pisa was captured by the Saracens,\" that in\r\nthe following year \"the Pisans overthrew the Saracens at Reggio,\" and that\r\nin 1012 \"the Saracens came to Pisa and destroyed it.\" The city soon\r\nrecovered, however, sending no fewer than a hundred and twenty ships to\r\nSyria in 1099,[518] founding a merchant colony in Constantinople a few\r\nyears later,[519] and meanwhile carrying on an interurban warfare in Italy\r\nthat seemed to stimulate it to great activity.[520] A writer of 1114 tells\r\nus that at that time there were many heathen people--Turks, Libyans,\r\nParthians, and Chaldeans--to be found in Pisa. It was in the midst of such\r\nwars, in a cosmopolitan and commercial town, in a center where literary\r\nwork was not appreciated,[521] that the genius of Leonardo appears as one\r\nof the surprises of history, warning us again that \"we should draw no\r\nhoroscope; that we should expect little, for what we expect will not come\r\nto pass.\"[522]\r\n\r\nLeonardo's father was one William,[523] and he had a brother named\r\nBonaccingus,[524] but nothing further is {130} known of his family. As to\r\nFibonacci, most writers[525] have assumed that his father's name was\r\nBonaccio,[526] whence _filius Bonaccii_, or Fibonacci. Others[527] believe\r\nthat the name, even in the Latin form of _filius Bonaccii_ as used in\r\nLeonardo's work, was simply a general one, like our Johnson or Bronson\r\n(Brown's son); and the only contemporary evidence that we have bears out\r\nthis view. As to the name Bigollo, used by Leonardo, some have thought it a\r\nself-assumed one meaning blockhead, a term that had been applied to him by\r\nthe commercial world or possibly by the university circle, and taken by him\r\nthat he might prove what a blockhead could do. Milanesi,[528] however, has\r\nshown that the word Bigollo (or Pigollo) was used in Tuscany to mean a\r\ntraveler, and was naturally assumed by one who had studied, as Leonardo\r\nhad, in foreign lands.\r\n\r\nLeonardo's father was a commercial agent at Bugia, the modern Bougie,[529]\r\nthe ancient Saldae on the coast of Barbary,[530] a royal capital under the\r\nVandals and again, a century before Leonardo, under the Beni Hammad. It had\r\none of the best harbors on the coast, sheltered as it is by Mt. Lalla\r\nGuraia,[531] and at the close of the twelfth century it was a center of\r\nAfrican commerce. It was here that Leonardo was taken as a child, and here\r\nhe went to school to a Moorish master. When he reached the years of young\r\nmanhood he started on a tour of the Mediterranean Sea, and visited Egypt,\r\nSyria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, meeting with scholars as well as with\r\n{131} merchants, and imbibing a knowledge of the various systems of numbers\r\nin use in the centers of trade. All these systems, however, he says he\r\ncounted almost as errors compared with that of the Hindus.[532] Returning\r\nto Pisa, he wrote his _Liber Abaci_[533] in 1202, rewriting it in\r\n1228.[534] In this work the numerals are explained and are used in the\r\nusual computations of business. Such a treatise was not destined to be\r\npopular, however, because it was too advanced for the mercantile class, and\r\ntoo novel for the conservative university circles. Indeed, at this time\r\nmathematics had only slight place in the newly established universities, as\r\nwitness the oldest known statute of the Sorbonne at Paris, dated 1215,\r\nwhere the subject is referred to only in an incidental way.[535] The period\r\nwas one of great commercial activity, and on this very {132} account such a\r\nbook would attract even less attention than usual.[536]\r\n\r\nIt would now be thought that the western world would at once adopt the new\r\nnumerals which Leonardo had made known, and which were so much superior to\r\nanything that had been in use in Christian Europe. The antagonism of the\r\nuniversities would avail but little, it would seem, against such an\r\nimprovement. It must be remembered, however, that there was great\r\ndifficulty in spreading knowledge at this time, some two hundred and fifty\r\nyears before printing was invented. \"Popes and princes and even great\r\nreligious institutions possessed far fewer books than many farmers of the\r\npresent age. The library belonging to the Cathedral Church of San Martino\r\nat Lucca in the ninth century contained only nineteen volumes of\r\nabridgments from ecclesiastical commentaries.\"[537] Indeed, it was not\r\nuntil the early part of the fifteenth century that Palla degli Strozzi took\r\nsteps to carry out the project that had been in the mind of Petrarch, the\r\nfounding of a public library. It was largely by word of mouth, therefore,\r\nthat this early knowledge had to be transmitted. Fortunately the presence\r\nof foreign students in Italy at this time made this transmission feasible.\r\n(If human nature was the same then as now, it is not impossible that the\r\nvery opposition of the faculties to the works of Leonardo led the students\r\nto investigate {133} them the more zealously.) At Vicenza in 1209, for\r\nexample, there were Bohemians, Poles, Frenchmen, Burgundians, Germans, and\r\nSpaniards, not to speak of representatives of divers towns of Italy; and\r\nwhat was true there was also true of other intellectual centers. The\r\nknowledge could not fail to spread, therefore, and as a matter of fact we\r\nfind numerous bits of evidence that this was the case. Although the bankers\r\nof Florence were forbidden to use these numerals in 1299, and the statutes\r\nof the university of Padua required stationers to keep the price lists of\r\nbooks \"non per cifras, sed per literas claros,\"[538] the numerals really\r\nmade much headway from about 1275 on.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, rather exceptional for the common people of Germany to use\r\nthe Arabic numerals before the sixteenth century, a good witness to this\r\nfact being the popular almanacs. Calendars of 1457-1496[539] have generally\r\nthe Roman numerals, while Köbel's calendar of 1518 gives the Arabic forms\r\nas subordinate to the Roman. In the register of the Kreuzschule at Dresden\r\nthe Roman forms were used even until 1539.\r\n\r\nWhile not minimizing the importance of the scientific work of Leonardo of\r\nPisa, we may note that the more popular treatises by Alexander de Villa Dei\r\n(c. 1240 A.D.) and John of Halifax (Sacrobosco, c. 1250 A.D.) were much\r\nmore widely used, and doubtless contributed more to the spread of the\r\nnumerals among the common people.\r\n\r\n{134}\r\n\r\nThe _Carmen de Algorismo_[540] of Alexander de Villa Dei was written in\r\nverse, as indeed were many other textbooks of that time. That it was widely\r\nused is evidenced by the large number of manuscripts[541] extant in\r\nEuropean libraries. Sacrobosco's _Algorismus_,[542] in which some lines\r\nfrom the Carmen are quoted, enjoyed a wide popularity as a textbook for\r\nuniversity instruction.[543] The work was evidently written with this end\r\nin view, as numerous commentaries by university lecturers are found.\r\nProbably the most widely used of these was that of Petrus de Dacia[544]\r\nwritten in 1291. These works throw an interesting light upon the method of\r\ninstruction in mathematics in use in the universities from the thirteenth\r\neven to the sixteenth century. Evidently the text was first read and copied\r\nby students.[545] Following this came line by line an exposition of the\r\ntext, such as is given in Petrus de Dacia's commentary.\r\n\r\nSacrobosco's work is of interest also because it was probably due to the\r\nextended use of this work that the {135} term _Arabic numerals_ became\r\ncommon. In two places there is mention of the inventors of this system. In\r\nthe introduction it is stated that this science of reckoning was due to a\r\nphilosopher named Algus, whence the name _algorismus_,[546] and in the\r\nsection on numeration reference is made to the Arabs as the inventors of\r\nthis science.[547] While some of the commentators, Petrus de Dacia[548]\r\namong them, knew of the Hindu origin, most of them undoubtedly took the\r\ntext as it stood; and so the Arabs were credited with the invention of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe first definite trace that we have of an algorism in the French language\r\nis found in a manuscript written about 1275.[549] This interesting leaf,\r\nfor the part on algorism consists of a single folio, was noticed by the\r\nAbbé Leboeuf as early as 1741,[550] and by Daunou in 1824.[551] It then\r\nseems to have been lost in the multitude of Paris manuscripts; for although\r\nChasles[552] relates his vain search for it, it was not rediscovered until\r\n1882. In that year M. Ch. Henry found it, and to his care we owe our\r\nknowledge of the interesting manuscript. The work is anonymous and is\r\ndevoted almost entirely to geometry, only {136} two pages (one folio)\r\nrelating to arithmetic. In these the forms of the numerals are given, and a\r\nvery brief statement as to the operations, it being evident that the writer\r\nhimself had only the slightest understanding of the subject.\r\n\r\nOnce the new system was known in France, even thus superficially, it would\r\nbe passed across the Channel to England. Higden,[553] writing soon after\r\nthe opening of the fourteenth century, speaks of the French influence at\r\nthat time and for some generations preceding:[554] \"For two hundred years\r\nchildren in scole, agenst the usage and manir of all other nations beeth\r\ncompelled for to leave hire own language, and for to construe hir lessons\r\nand hire thynges in Frensche.... Gentilmen children beeth taught to speke\r\nFrensche from the tyme that they bith rokked in hir cradell; and\r\nuplondissche men will likne himself to gentylmen, and fondeth with greet\r\nbesynesse for to speke Frensche.\"\r\n\r\nThe question is often asked, why did not these new numerals attract more\r\nimmediate attention? Why did they have to wait until the sixteenth century\r\nto be generally used in business and in the schools? In reply it may be\r\nsaid that in their elementary work the schools always wait upon the demands\r\nof trade. That work which pretends to touch the life of the people must\r\ncome reasonably near doing so. Now the computations of business until about\r\n1500 did not demand the new figures, for two reasons: First, cheap paper\r\nwas not known. Paper-making of any kind was not introduced into Europe\r\nuntil {137} the twelfth century, and cheap paper is a product of the\r\nnineteenth. Pencils, too, of the modern type, date only from the sixteenth\r\ncentury. In the second place, modern methods of operating, particularly of\r\nmultiplying and dividing (operations of relatively greater importance when\r\nall measures were in compound numbers requiring reductions at every step),\r\nwere not yet invented. The old plan required the erasing of figures after\r\nthey had served their purpose, an operation very simple with counters,\r\nsince they could be removed. The new plan did not as easily permit this.\r\nHence we find the new numerals very tardily admitted to the counting-house,\r\nand not welcomed with any enthusiasm by teachers.[555]\r\n\r\nAside from their use in the early treatises on the new art of reckoning,\r\nthe numerals appeared from time to time in the dating of manuscripts and\r\nupon monuments. The oldest definitely dated European document known {138}\r\nto contain the numerals is a Latin manuscript,[556] the Codex Vigilanus,\r\nwritten in the Albelda Cloister not far from Logroño in Spain, in 976 A.D.\r\nThe nine characters (of [.g]ob[=a]r type), without the zero, are given as\r\nan addition to the first chapters of the third book of the _Origines_ by\r\nIsidorus of Seville, in which the Roman numerals are under discussion.\r\nAnother Spanish copy of the same work, of 992 A.D., contains the numerals\r\nin the corresponding section. The writer ascribes an Indian origin to them\r\nin the following words: \"Item de figuris arithmetic[e,]. Scire debemus in\r\nIndos subtilissimum ingenium habere et ceteras gentes eis in arithmetica et\r\ngeometria et ceteris liberalibus disciplinis concedere. Et hoc manifestum\r\nest in nobem figuris, quibus designant unumquemque gradum cuiuslibet\r\ngradus. Quarum hec sunt forma.\" The nine [.g]ob[=a]r characters follow.\r\nSome of the abacus forms[557] previously given are doubtless also of the\r\ntenth century. The earliest Arabic documents containing the numerals are\r\ntwo manuscripts of 874 and 888 A.D.[558] They appear about a century later\r\nin a work[559] written at Shiraz in 970 A.D. There is also an early trace\r\nof their use on a pillar recently discovered in a church apparently\r\ndestroyed as early as the tenth century, not far from the Jeremias\r\nMonastery, in Egypt. {139} A graffito in Arabic on this pillar has the date\r\n349 A.H., which corresponds to 961 A.D.[560] For the dating of Latin\r\ndocuments the Arabic forms were used as early as the thirteenth\r\ncentury.[561]\r\n\r\nOn the early use of these numerals in Europe the only scientific study\r\nworthy the name is that made by Mr. G. F. Hill of the British Museum.[562]\r\nFrom his investigations it appears that the earliest occurrence of a date\r\nin these numerals on a coin is found in the reign of Roger of Sicily in\r\n1138.[563] Until recently it was thought that the earliest such date was\r\n1217 A.D. for an Arabic piece and 1388 for a Turkish one.[564] Most of the\r\nseals and medals containing dates that were at one time thought to be very\r\nearly have been shown by Mr. Hill to be of relatively late workmanship.\r\nThere are, however, in European manuscripts, numerous instances of the use\r\nof these numerals before the twelfth century. Besides the example in the\r\nCodex Vigilanus, another of the tenth century has been found in the St.\r\nGall MS. now in the University Library at Zürich, the forms differing\r\nmaterially from those in the Spanish codex.\r\n\r\nThe third specimen in point of time in Mr. Hill's list is from a Vatican\r\nMS. of 1077. The fourth and fifth specimens are from the Erlangen MS. of\r\nBoethius, of the same {140} (eleventh) century, and the sixth and seventh\r\nare also from an eleventh-century MS. of Boethius at Chartres. These and\r\nother early forms are given by Mr. Hill in this table, which is reproduced\r\nwith his kind permission.\r\n\r\nEARLIEST MANUSCRIPT FORMS\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis is one of more than fifty tables given in Mr. Hill's valuable paper,\r\nand to this monograph students {141} are referred for details as to the\r\ndevelopment of number-forms in Europe from the tenth to the sixteenth\r\ncentury. It is of interest to add that he has found that among the earliest\r\ndates of European coins or medals in these numerals, after the Sicilian one\r\nalready mentioned, are the following: Austria, 1484; Germany, 1489\r\n(Cologne); Switzerland, 1424 (St. Gall); Netherlands, 1474; France, 1485;\r\nItaly, 1390.[565]\r\n\r\nThe earliest English coin dated in these numerals was struck in 1551,[566]\r\nalthough there is a Scotch piece of 1539.[567] In numbering pages of a\r\nprinted book these numerals were first used in a work of Petrarch's\r\npublished at Cologne in 1471.[568] The date is given in the following form\r\nin the _Biblia Pauperum_,[569] a block-book of 1470,\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nwhile in another block-book which possibly goes back to c. 1430[570] the\r\nnumerals appear in several illustrations, with forms as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMany printed works anterior to 1471 have pages or chapters numbered by\r\nhand, but many of these numerals are {142} of date much later than the\r\nprinting of the work. Other works were probably numbered directly after\r\nprinting. Thus the chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in a book of 1470[571] are\r\nnumbered as follows: Capitulem [Symbol 2]m.,... [Symbol 3]m.,... 4m.,...\r\nv,... vi, and followed by Roman numerals. This appears in the body of the\r\ntext, in spaces left by the printer to be filled in by hand. Another\r\nbook[572] of 1470 has pages numbered by hand with a mixture of Roman and\r\nHindu numerals, thus,\r\n\r\n  [Illustration] for 125      [Illustration] for 150\r\n  [Illustration] for 147      [Illustration] for 202\r\n\r\nAs to monumental inscriptions,[573] there was once thought to be a\r\ngravestone at Katharein, near Troppau, with the date 1007, and one at\r\nBiebrich of 1299. There is no doubt, however, of one at Pforzheim of 1371\r\nand one at Ulm of 1388.[574] Certain numerals on Wells Cathedral have been\r\nassigned to the thirteenth century, but they are undoubtedly considerably\r\nlater.[575]\r\n\r\nThe table on page 143 will serve to supplement that from Mr. Hill's\r\nwork.[576]\r\n\r\n{143}\r\n\r\nEARLY MANUSCRIPT FORMS\r\n\r\n  [577] [Illustration] Twelfth century A.D.\r\n  [578] [Illustration] 1197 A.D.\r\n  [579] [Illustration] 1275 A.D.\r\n  [580] [Illustration] c. 1294 A.D.\r\n  [581] [Illustration] c. 1303 A.D.\r\n  [582] [Illustration] c. 1360 A.D.\r\n  [583] [Illustration] c. 1442 A.D.\r\n\r\n{144}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor the sake of further comparison, three illustrations from works in Mr.\r\nPlimpton's library, reproduced from the _Rara Arithmetica_, may be\r\nconsidered. The first is from a Latin manuscript on arithmetic,[584] of\r\nwhich the original was written at Paris in 1424 by Rollandus, a Portuguese\r\nphysician, who prepared the work at the command of John of Lancaster, Duke\r\nof Bedford, at one time Protector of England and Regent of France, to whom\r\nthe work is dedicated. The figures show the successive powers of 2. The\r\nsecond illustration is from Luca da Firenze's _Inprencipio darte\r\ndabacho_,[585] c. 1475, and the third is from an anonymous manuscript[586]\r\nof about 1500.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs to the forms of the numerals, fashion played a leading part until\r\nprinting was invented. This tended to fix these forms, although in writing\r\nthere is still a great variation, as witness the French 5 and the German 7\r\nand 9. Even in printing there is not complete uniformity, {145} and it is\r\noften difficult for a foreigner to distinguish between the 3 and 5 of the\r\nFrench types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs to the particular numerals, the following are some of the forms to be\r\nfound in the later manuscripts and in the early printed books.\r\n\r\n1. In the early printed books \"one\" was often i, perhaps to save types,\r\njust as some modern typewriters use the same character for l and 1.[587] In\r\nthe manuscripts the \"one\" appears in such forms as[588]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n2. \"Two\" often appears as z in the early printed books, 12 appearing as\r\niz.[589] In the medieval manuscripts the following forms are common:[590]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{146}\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from the early traces, that it is merely a cursive form for\r\nthe primitive [2 horizontal strokes], just as 3 comes from [3 horizontal\r\nstrokes], as in the N[=a]n[=a] Gh[=a]t inscriptions.\r\n\r\n3. \"Three\" usually had a special type in the first printed books, although\r\noccasionally it appears as [Symbol].[591] In the medieval manuscripts it\r\nvaried rather less than most of the others. The following are common\r\nforms:[592]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n4. \"Four\" has changed greatly; and one of the first tests as to the age of\r\na manuscript on arithmetic, and the place where it was written, is the\r\nexamination of this numeral. Until the time of printing the most common\r\nform was [Symbol], although the Florentine manuscript of Leonard of Pisa's\r\nwork has the form [Symbol];[593] but the manuscripts show that the\r\nFlorentine arithmeticians and astronomers rather early began to straighten\r\nthe first of these forms up to forms like [Symbol][594] and [Symbol][594]\r\nor [Symbol],[595] more closely resembling our own. The first printed books\r\ngenerally used our present form[596] with the closed top [Symbol], the open\r\ntop used in writing ( [Symbol]) being {147} purely modern. The following\r\nare other forms of the four, from various manuscripts:[597]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n5. \"Five\" also varied greatly before the time of printing. The following\r\nare some of the forms:[598]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n6. \"Six\" has changed rather less than most of the others. The chief\r\nvariation has been in the slope of the top, as will be seen in the\r\nfollowing:[599]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n7. \"Seven,\" like \"four,\" has assumed its present erect form only since the\r\nfifteenth century. In medieval times it appeared as follows:[600]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{148}\r\n\r\n8. \"Eight,\" like \"six,\" has changed but little. In medieval times there are\r\na few variants of interest as follows:[601]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, however, there was manifested a tendency to write\r\nit [Symbol].[602]\r\n\r\n9. \"Nine\" has not varied as much as most of the others. Among the medieval\r\nforms are the following:[603]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n0. The shape of the zero also had a varied history. The following are\r\ncommon medieval forms:[604]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the place value was a serious matter to most of the\r\nearly writers. If they had been using an abacus constructed like the\r\nRussian chotü, and had placed this before all learners of the positional\r\nsystem, there would have been little trouble. But the medieval {149}\r\nline-reckoning, where the lines stood for powers of 10 and the spaces for\r\nhalf of such powers, did not lend itself to this comparison. Accordingly we\r\nfind such labored explanations as the following, from _The Crafte of\r\nNombrynge_:\r\n\r\n\"Euery of these figuris bitokens hym selfe & no more, yf he stonde in the\r\nfirst place of the rewele....\r\n\r\n\"If it stonde in the secunde place of the rewle, he betokens ten tymes hym\r\nselfe, as this figure 2 here 20 tokens ten tyme hym selfe, that is twenty,\r\nfor he hym selfe betokens tweyne, & ten tymes twene is twenty. And for he\r\nstondis on the lyft side & in the secunde place, he betokens ten tyme hym\r\nselfe. And so go forth....\r\n\r\n\"Nil cifra significat sed dat signare sequenti. Expone this verse. A cifre\r\ntokens no[gh]t, bot he makes the figure to betoken that comes after hym\r\nmore than he shuld & he were away, as thus 10. here the figure of one\r\ntokens ten, & yf the cifre were away & no figure byfore hym he schuld token\r\nbot one, for than he schuld stonde in the first place....\"[605]\r\n\r\nIt would seem that a system that was thus used for dating documents, coins,\r\nand monuments, would have been generally adopted much earlier than it was,\r\nparticularly in those countries north of Italy where it did not come into\r\ngeneral use until the sixteenth century. This, however, has been the fate\r\nof many inventions, as witness our neglect of logarithms and of contracted\r\nprocesses to-day.\r\n\r\nAs to Germany, the fifteenth century saw the rise of the new symbolism; the\r\nsixteenth century saw it slowly {150} gain the mastery; the seventeenth\r\ncentury saw it finally conquer the system that for two thousand years had\r\ndominated the arithmetic of business. Not a little of the success of the\r\nnew plan was due to Luther's demand that all learning should go into the\r\nvernacular.[606]\r\n\r\nDuring the transition period from the Roman to the Arabic numerals, various\r\nanomalous forms found place. For example, we have in the fourteenth century\r\nc[alpha] for 104;[607] 1000. 300. 80 et 4 for 1384;[608] and in a\r\nmanuscript of the fifteenth century 12901 for 1291.[609] In the same\r\ncentury m. cccc. 8II appears for 1482,[610] while M^oCCCC^o50 (1450) and\r\nMCCCCXL6 (1446) are used by Theodoricus Ruffi about the same time.[611] To\r\nthe next century belongs the form 1vojj for 1502. Even in Sfortunati's\r\n_Nuovo lume_[612] the use of ordinals is quite confused, the propositions\r\non a single page being numbered \"tertia,\" \"4,\" and \"V.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough not connected with the Arabic numerals in any direct way, the\r\nmedieval astrological numerals may here be mentioned. These are given by\r\nseveral early writers, but notably by Noviomagus (1539),[613] as\r\nfollows[614]:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{151}\r\n\r\nThus we find the numerals gradually replacing the Roman forms all over\r\nEurope, from the time of Leonardo of Pisa until the seventeenth century.\r\nBut in the Far East to-day they are quite unknown in many countries, and\r\nthey still have their way to make. In many parts of India, among the common\r\npeople of Japan and China, in Siam and generally about the Malay Peninsula,\r\nin Tibet, and among the East India islands, the natives still adhere to\r\ntheir own numeral forms. Only as Western civilization is making its way\r\ninto the commercial life of the East do the numerals as used by us find\r\nplace, save as the Sanskrit forms appear in parts of India. It is therefore\r\nwith surprise that the student of mathematics comes to realize how modern\r\nare these forms so common in the West, how limited is their use even at the\r\npresent time, and how slow the world has been and is in adopting such a\r\nsimple device as the Hindu-Arabic numerals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{153}\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n_Transcriber's note: many of the entries refer to footnotes linked from the\r\npage numbers given._\r\n\r\n  Abbo of Fleury, 122\r\n  `Abdall[=a]h ibn al-[H.]asan, 92\r\n  `Abdallat[=i]f ibn Y[=u]suf, 93\r\n  `Abdalq[=a]dir ibn `Al[=i] al-Sakh[=a]w[=i], 6\r\n  Abenragel, 34\r\n  Abraham ibn Meïr ibn Ezra, _see_ Rabbi ben Ezra\r\n  Ab[=u] `Al[=i] al-[H.]osein ibn S[=i]n[=a], 74\r\n  Ab[=u] 'l-[H.]asan, 93, 100\r\n  Ab[=u] 'l-Q[=a]sim, 92\r\n  Ab[=u] 'l-[T.]eiyib, 97\r\n  Ab[=u] Na[s.]r, 92\r\n  Ab[=u] Roshd, 113\r\n  Abu Sahl Dunash ibn Tamim, 65, 67\r\n  Adelhard of Bath, 5, 55, 97, 119, 123, 126\r\n  Adhemar of Chabanois, 111\r\n  A[h.]med al-Nasaw[=i], 98\r\n  A[h.]med ibn `Abdall[=a]h, 9, 92\r\n  A[h.]med ibn Mo[h.]ammed, 94\r\n  A[h.]med ibn `Omar, 93\r\n  Ak[s.]aras, 32\r\n  Alanus ab Insulis, 124\r\n  Al-Ba[.g]d[=a]d[=i], 93\r\n  Al-Batt[=a]n[=i], 54\r\n  Albelda (Albaida) MS., 116\r\n  Albert, J., 62\r\n  Albert of York, 103\r\n  Al-B[=i]r[=u]n[=i], 6, 41, 49, 65, 92, 93\r\n  Alcuin, 103\r\n  Alexander the Great, 76\r\n  Alexander de Villa Dei, 11, 133\r\n  Alexandria, 64, 82\r\n  Al-Faz[=a]r[=i], 92\r\n  Alfred, 103\r\n  Algebra, etymology, 5\r\n  Algerian numerals, 68\r\n  Algorism, 97\r\n  Algorismus, 124, 126, 135\r\n  Algorismus cifra, 120\r\n  Al-[H.]a[s.][s.][=a]r, 65\r\n  `Al[=i] ibn Ab[=i] Bekr, 6\r\n  `Al[=i] ibn A[h.]med, 93, 98\r\n  Al-Kar[=a]b[=i]s[=i], 93\r\n  Al-Khow[=a]razm[=i], 4, 9, 10, 92, 97, 98, 125, 126\r\n  Al-Kind[=i], 10, 92\r\n  Almagest, 54\r\n  Al-Ma[.g]reb[=i], 93\r\n  Al-Ma[h.]all[=i], 6\r\n  Al-M[=a]m[=u]n, 10, 97\r\n  Al-Man[s.][=u]r, 96, 97\r\n  Al-Mas`[=u]d[=i], 7, 92\r\n  Al-Nad[=i]m, 9\r\n  Al-Nasaw[=i], 93, 98\r\n  Alphabetic numerals, 39, 40, 43\r\n  Al-Q[=a]sim, 92\r\n  Al-Qass, 94\r\n  Al-Sakh[=a]w[=i], 6\r\n  Al-[S.]ardaf[=i], 93\r\n  Al-Sijz[=i], 94\r\n  Al-S[=u]f[=i], 10, 92\r\n  Ambrosoli, 118\r\n  A[.n]kapalli, 43\r\n  Apices, 87, 117, 118\r\n  Arabs, 91-98\r\n  Arbuthnot, 141\r\n  {154}\r\n  Archimedes, 15, 16\r\n  Arcus Pictagore, 122\r\n  Arjuna, 15\r\n  Arnold, E., 15, 102\r\n  Ars memorandi, 141\r\n  [=A]ryabha[t.]a, 39, 43, 44\r\n  Aryan numerals, 19\r\n  Aschbach, 134\r\n  Ashmole, 134\r\n  A['s]oka, 19, 20, 22, 81\r\n  A[s.]-[s.]ifr, 57, 58\r\n  Astrological numerals, 150\r\n  Atharva-Veda, 48, 49, 55\r\n  Augustus, 80\r\n  Averroës, 113\r\n  Avicenna, 58, 74, 113\r\n\r\n  Babylonian numerals, 28\r\n  Babylonian zero, 51\r\n  Bacon, R., 131\r\n  Bactrian numerals, 19, 30\r\n  Bæda, 2, 72\r\n  Bagdad, 4, 96\r\n  Bakh[s.][=a]l[=i] manuscript, 43, 49, 52, 53\r\n  Ball, C.

The order of\r\ntopics has been changed to a certain extent; the plan is to have each\r\nchapter as complete in itself as possible, so that the teacher may vary the\r\norder of succession at his discretion.\r\n\r\nAs the name implies, the work is intended for colleges and scientific\r\nschools. The first part is simply a review of the principles of algebra\r\npreceding Quadratic Equations, with just enough examples to illustrate and\r\nenforce these principles. By this brief treatment of the first chapters\r\nsufficient space is allowed, without making the book cumbersome, for a full\r\ndiscussion of Quadratic Equations, The Binomial Theorem, Choice Chance,\r\nSeries, Determinants, and the General Properties of Equations.\r\n\r\nEvery effort has been made to present in the clearest light each subject\r\ndiscussed, and to give in matter and methods the best training in algebraic\r\nanalysis at present attainable.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\nBy G.

It is\r\narranged in harmony with the leading courses of study that include algebra\r\nin the curriculum of the grades.\r\n\r\nThe relation of algebra to arithmetic is emphasized, the subject is treated\r\ntopically, and each important point is touched at least twice. The book\r\nbegins by showing the uses of algebra, employing such practical\r\napplications as are within the pupil's range of knowledge. When an interest\r\nhas thus been awakened in the subject, the fundamental operations are\r\npresented with the simple explanations necessary to make the student\r\nindependent of dogmatic rules. Throughout the book abundant oral and\r\nwritten drill exercises are provided. The work includes linear equations\r\nwith two unknown quantities, and easy quadratics.\r\n\r\nThe leading features may be summarized as follows: (1) an arrangement in\r\nharmony with existing courses of study; (2) a presentation designed to\r\nawaken the interest of the pupils; (3) a topical arrangement for each half\r\nyear, every important topic being repeated; (4) simplicity of explanations;\r\n(5) development of the relation of algebra to arithmetic both in theory and\r\nin applications; (6) emphasis laid on the importance of oral as well as\r\nwritten algebra.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nGINN & COMPANY PUBLISHERS\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS FOR TEACHERS\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                             List price\r\n  Allen: Civics and Health                                      $1.25\r\n  Brigham: Geographic Influences in American History             1.25\r\n  Channing and Hart: Guide to the Study of American History      2.00\r\n  Hall: Aspects of Child Life and Education                      1.50\r\n  Hodge: Nature Study and Life                                   1.50\r\n  Johnson: Education by Plays and Games                           .90\r\n  Johnson: What to Do at Recess                                   .25\r\n  Kern: Among Country Schools                                    1.25\r\n  Mace: Method in History                                        1.00\r\n  MacVicar: The Principles of Education                           .60\r\n  Moral Training in the Public Schools                           1.25\r\n  Prince: Courses of Studies and Methods of Teaching              .75\r\n  Scott: Social Education                                        1.25\r\n  Tompkins: Philosophy of School Management                       .75\r\n  Tompkins: Philosophy of Teaching                                .75\r\n  Wiltse: Place of the Story in Early Education, and Other Essays.\r\n     A Manual for Teachers                                        .50\r\n\r\nFOR CLASS RECORDS\r\n\r\n  Comings: Complete Record--Attendance and Scholarship\r\n      Graded-School Edition                                       .30\r\n      High-School Edition                                         .30\r\n  Ginn and Company: Teacher's Class Books\r\n      No. I                                                       .30\r\n      No. II                                                      .40\r\n      Twenty Weeks' Class Book                                    .30\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nGINN AND COMPANY Publishers\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXTBOOKS ON MATHEMATICS\r\n\r\nFOR HIGHER SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES\r\n\r\n                                                                   List\r\n                                                                     price\r\n  Bailey and Woods: Analytic Geometry                                $2.00\r\n  Beman and Smith: Academic Algebra                                   1.12\r\n  Beman and Smith: Higher Arithmetic                                   .80\r\n  Beman and Smith: New Plane and Solid Geometry                       1.25\r\n  Breckenridge, Mersereau, and Moore: Shop Problems in Mathematics    1.00\r\n  Byerly: Differential Calculus                                       2.00\r\n  Byerly: Integral Calculus (Second Edition.

An interesting example of a forgery\r\nin ecclesiastical matters is in the charter said to have been given by St.\r\nPatrick, granting indulgences to the benefactors of Glastonbury, dated \"In\r\nnomine domini nostri Jhesu Christi Ego Patricius humilis servunculus Dei\r\nanno incarnationis ejusdem ccccxxx.\" Now if the Benedictines are right in\r\nsaying that Dionysius Exiguus, a Scythian monk, first arranged the\r\nChristian chronology c. 532 A.D., this can hardly be other than spurious.\r\nSee Arbuthnot, loc. cit., p. 38.\r\n\r\n[1] \"_Discipulus._ Quis primus invenit numerum apud Hebræos et Ægyptios?\r\n_Magister._ Abraham primus invenit numerum apud Hebræos, deinde Moses; et\r\nAbraham tradidit istam scientiam numeri ad Ægyptios, et docuit eos: deinde\r\nJosephus.\" [Bede, _De computo dialogus_ (doubtfully assigned to him),\r\n_Opera omnia_, Paris, 1862, Vol. I, p. 650.]\r\n\r\n\"Alii referunt ad Phoenices inventores arithmeticæ, propter eandem\r\ncommerciorum caussam: Alii ad Indos: Ioannes de Sacrobosco, cujus\r\nsepulchrum est Lutetiæ in comitio Maturinensi, refert ad Arabes.\" [Ramus,\r\n_Arithmeticæ libri dvo_, Basel, 1569, p. 112.]\r\n\r\nSimilar notes are given by Peletarius in his commentary on the arithmetic\r\nof Gemma Frisius (1563 ed., fol. 77), and in his own work (1570 Lyons ed.,\r\np. 14): \"La valeur des Figures commence au coste dextre tirant vers le\r\ncoste senestre: au rebours de notre maniere d'escrire par ce que la\r\npremiere prattique est venue des Chaldees: ou des Pheniciens, qui ont été\r\nles premiers traffiquers de marchandise.\"\r\n\r\n[2] Maximus Planudes (c. 1330) states that \"the nine symbols come from the\r\nIndians.\" [Wäschke's German translation, Halle, 1878, p. 3.] Willichius\r\nspeaks of the \"Zyphræ Indicæ,\" in his _Arithmeticæ libri tres_ (Strasburg,\r\n1540, p. 93), and Cataneo of \"le noue figure de gli Indi,\" in his _Le\r\npratiche delle dve prime mathematiche_ (Venice, 1546, fol. 1). Woepcke is\r\nnot correct, therefore, in saying (\"Mémoire sur la propagation des chiffres\r\nindiens,\" hereafter referred to as _Propagation_ [_Journal Asiatique_, Vol.\r\nI (6), 1863, p. 34]) that Wallis (_A Treatise on Algebra, both historical\r\nand practical_, London, 1685, p. 13, and _De algebra tractatus_, Latin\r\nedition in his _Opera omnia_, 1693, Vol. II, p. 10) was one of the first to\r\ngive the Hindu origin.\r\n\r\n[3] From the 1558 edition of _The Grovnd of Artes_, fol. C, 5. Similarly\r\nBishop Tonstall writes: \"Qui a Chaldeis primum in finitimos, deinde in\r\nomnes pene gentes fluxit.... Numerandi artem a Chaldeis esse profectam: qui\r\ndum scribunt, a dextra incipiunt, et in leuam progrediuntur.\" [_De arte\r\nsupputandi_, London, 1522, fol. B, 3.] Gemma Frisius, the great continental\r\nrival of Recorde, had the same idea: \"Primùm autem appellamus dexterum\r\nlocum, eo quòd haec ars vel à Chaldæis, vel ab Hebræis ortum habere\r\ncredatur, qui etiam eo ordine scribunt\"; but this refers more evidently to\r\nthe Arabic numerals. [_Arithmeticæ practicæ methodvs facilis_, Antwerp,\r\n1540, fol. 4 of the 1563 ed.] Sacrobosco (c. 1225) mentions the same thing.\r\nEven the modern Jewish writers claim that one of their scholars,\r\nM[=a]sh[=a]ll[=a]h (c. 800), introduced them to the Mohammedan world. [C.\r\nLevias, _The Jewish Encyclopedia_, New York, 1905, Vol. IX, p. 348.]\r\n\r\n[4] \"... & que esto fu trouato di fare da gli Arabi con diece figure.\" [_La\r\nprima parte del general trattato di nvmeri, et misvre_, Venice, 1556, fol.\r\n9 of the 1592 edition.]\r\n\r\n[5] \"Vom welchen Arabischen auch disz Kunst entsprungen ist.\" [_Ain nerv\r\ngeordnet Rechenbiechlin_, Augsburg, 1514, fol. 13 of the 1531 edition. The\r\nprinter used the letters _rv_ for _w_ in \"new\" in the first edition, as he\r\nhad no _w_ of the proper font.]\r\n\r\n[6] Among them Glareanus: \"Characteres simplices sunt nouem significatiui,\r\nab Indis usque, siue Chaldæis asciti .1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9. Est item unus .0\r\ncirculus, qui nihil significat.\" [_De VI. Arithmeticae practicae\r\nspeciebvs_, Paris, 1539, fol. 9 of the 1543 edition.]\r\n\r\n[7] \"Barbarische oder gemeine Ziffern.\" [Anonymous, _Das Einmahl Eins cum\r\nnotis variorum_, Dresden, 1703, p. 3.] So Vossius (_De universae matheseos\r\nnatura et constitutione liber_, Amsterdam, 1650, p. 34) calls them\r\n\"Barbaras numeri notas.\" The word at that time was possibly synonymous with\r\nArabic.\r\n\r\n[8] His full name was `Ab[=u] `Abdall[=a]h Mo[h.]ammed ibn M[=u]s[=a]\r\nal-Khow[=a]razm[=i]. He was born in Khow[=a]rezm, \"the lowlands,\" the\r\ncountry about the present Khiva and bordering on the Oxus, and lived at\r\nBagdad under the caliph al-M[=a]m[=u]n. He died probably between 220 and\r\n230 of the Mohammedan era, that is, between 835 and 845 A.D., although some\r\nput the date as early as 812. The best account of this great scholar may be\r\nfound in an article by C. Nallino, \"Al-[H)]uw[=a]rizm[=i]\" in the _Atti\r\ndella R. Accad. dei Lincei_, Rome, 1896.

Woepcke in _Propagation_, p. 489. So recently has he become known that\r\nHeilbronner, writing in 1742, merely mentions him as \"Ben-Musa, inter\r\nArabes celebris Geometra, scripsit de figuris planis & sphericis.\"\r\n[_Historia matheseos universæ_, Leipzig, 1742, p. 438.]\r\n\r\nIn this work most of the Arabic names will be transliterated substantially\r\nas laid down by Suter in his work _Die Mathematiker_ etc., except where\r\nthis violates English pronunciation. The scheme of pronunciation of\r\noriental names is set forth in the preface.\r\n\r\n[9] Our word _algebra_ is from the title of one of his works, Al-jabr\r\nwa'l-muq[=a]balah, Completion and Comparison. The work was translated into\r\nEnglish by F. Rosen, London, 1831, and treated in _L'Algèbre\r\nd'al-Kh[=a]rizmi et les méthodes indienne et grecque_, Léon Rodet, Paris,\r\n1878, extract from the _Journal Asiatique_. For the derivation of the word\r\n_algebra_, see Cossali, _Scritti Inediti_, pp. 381-383, Rome, 1857;\r\nLeonardo's _Liber Abbaci_ (1202), p. 410, Rome, 1857; both published by B.\r\nBoncompagni. \"Almuchabala\" also was used as a name for algebra.\r\n\r\n[10] This learned scholar, teacher of O'Creat who wrote the _Helceph_\r\n(\"_Prologus N. Ocreati in Helceph ad Adelardum Batensem magistrum suum_\"),\r\nstudied in Toledo, learned Arabic, traveled as far east as Egypt, and\r\nbrought from the Levant numerous manuscripts for study and translation. See\r\nHenry in the _Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der Mathematik_, Vol. III, p.\r\n131; Woepcke in _Propagation_, p. 518.\r\n\r\n[11] The title is _Algoritmi de numero Indorum_. That he did not make this\r\ntranslation is asserted by Eneström in the _Bibliotheca Mathematica_, Vol.\r\nI (3), p. 520.\r\n\r\n[12] Thus he speaks \"de numero indorum per .IX. literas,\" and proceeds:\r\n\"Dixit algoritmi: Cum uidissem yndos constituisse .IX. literas in uniuerso\r\nnumero suo, propter dispositionem suam quam posuerunt, uolui patefacere de\r\nopera quod fit per eas aliquid quod esset leuius discentibus, si deus\r\nuoluerit.\" [Boncompagni, _Trattati d'Aritmetica_,  Rome, 1857.] Discussed\r\nby F. Woepcke, _Sur l'introduction de l'arithmétique indienne en Occident_,\r\nRome, 1859.\r\n\r\n[13] Thus in a commentary by `Al[=i] ibn Ab[=i] Bekr ibn al-Jam[=a]l\r\nal-An[s.][=a]r[=i\r\n\r\n[14] See also Woepcke, _Propagation_, p. 505.

Weidler, _Spicilegium observationum ad historiam notarum numeralium_,\r\nWittenberg, 1755, derives them from the Hebrew letters; Dom Augustin\r\nCalmet, \"Recherches sur l'origine des chiffres d'arithmétique,\" _Mémoires\r\npour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts_, Trévoux, 1707 (pp.\r\n1620-1635, with two plates), derives the current symbols from the Romans,\r\nstating that they are relics of the ancient \"Notae Tironianae.\" These\r\n\"notes\" were part of a system of shorthand invented, or at least perfected,\r\nby Tiro, a slave who was freed by Cicero. L. A. Sedillot, \"Sur l'origine de\r\nnos chiffres,\" _Atti dell' Accademia pontificia dei nuovi Lincei_, Vol.\r\nXVIII, 1864-1865, pp. 316-322, derives the Arabic forms from the Roman\r\nnumerals.\r\n\r\n[120] Athanasius Kircher, _Arithmologia sive De abditis Numerorum,\r\nmysterijs qua origo, antiquitas & fabrica Numerorum exponitur_, Rome, 1665.\r\n\r\n[121] See Suter, _Die Mathematiker und Astronomen der Araber_, p. 100.\r\n\r\n[122] \"Et hi numeri sunt numeri Indiani, a Brachmanis Indiae Sapientibus ex\r\nfigura circuli secti inuenti.\"\r\n\r\n[123] V.

Unde Sephar numerus est: hinc Siphra (vulgo corruptius).

It is curious that Finaeus (1555 ed., f. 2) used the\r\nform _tziphra_ throughout. A. J. H. Vincent [\"Sur l'origine de nos\r\nchiffres,\" _Notices et Extraits des MSS._, Paris, 1847, pp. 143-150] says:\r\n\"Ce cercle fut nommé par les uns, _sipos, rota, galgal_ ...; par les autres\r\n_tsiphra_ (de [Hebrew: TSPR], _couronne_ ou _diadème_) ou _ciphra_ (de\r\n[Hebrew: SPR], _numération_).\" Ch. de Paravey, _Essai sur l'origine unique\r\net hiéroglyphique des chiffres et des lettres de tous les peuples_, Paris,\r\n1826, p. 165, a rather fanciful work, gives \"vase, vase arrondi et fermé\r\npar un couvercle, qui est le symbole de la 10^e Heure, [symbol],\" among the\r\nChinese; also \"Tsiphron Zéron, ou tout à fait vide en arabe, [Greek:\r\ntziphra] en grec ... d'où chiffre (qui dérive plutôt, suivant nous, de\r\nl'Hébreu _Sepher_, compter.\")\r\n\r\n[216] \"Compilatus a Magistro Jacobo de Florentia apud montem pesalanum,\"\r\nand described by G.

In the _Catalogue of MSS., Bibl. de l'Arsenal_,\r\nVol. III, pp. 154-156, this work is No. 2904 (184 S.A.F.), Bibl. Nat., and\r\nis also called _Petit traicté de algorisme_.\r\n\r\n[230] Texada (1546) says that there are \"nueue letros yvn zero o cifra\" (f.\r\n3).\r\n\r\n[231] Savonne (1563, 1751 ed., f. 1): \"Vne ansi formee (o) qui s'appelle\r\nnulle, & entre marchans zero,\" showing the influence of Italian names on\r\nFrench mercantile customs. Trenchant (Lyons, 1566, 1578 ed., p. 12) also\r\nsays: \"La derniere qui s'apele nulle, ou zero;\" but Champenois, his\r\ncontemporary, writing in Paris in 1577 (although the work was not published\r\nuntil 1578), uses \"cipher,\" the Italian influence showing itself less in\r\nthis center of university culture than in the commercial atmosphere of\r\nLyons.\r\n\r\n[232] Thus Radulph of Laon (c. 1100): \"Inscribitur in ultimo ordine et\r\nfigura [symbol] sipos nomine, quae, licet numerum nullum signitet, tantum\r\nad alia quaedam utilis, ut insequentibus declarabitur.\" [\"Der Arithmetische\r\nTractat des Radulph von Laon,\" _Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der\r\nMathematik_, Vol. V, p. 97, from a manuscript of the thirteenth century.]\r\nChasles (_Comptes rendus_, t. 16, 1843, pp. 1393, 1408) calls attention to\r\nthe fact that Radulph did not know how to use the zero, and he doubts if\r\nthe sipos was really identical with it. Radulph says: \"... figuram, cui\r\nsipos nomen est [symbol] in motum rotulae formatam nullius numeri\r\nsignificatione inscribi solere praediximus,\" and thereafter uses _rotula_.\r\nHe uses the sipos simply as a kind of marker on the abacus.\r\n\r\n[233] Rabbi ben Ezra (1092-1168) used both [Hebrew: GLGL], _galgal_ (the\r\nHebrew for _wheel_), and [Hebrew: SPR'], _sifra_. See M. Steinschneider,\r\n\"Die Mathematik bei den Juden,\" in _Bibliotheca Mathematica_, 1893, p. 69,\r\nand Silberberg, _Das Buch der Zahl des R. Abraham ibn Esra_, Frankfurt a.\r\nM., 1895, p. 96, note 23; in this work the Hebrew letters are used for\r\nnumerals with place value, having the zero.\r\n\r\n[234] E.g., in the twelfth-century _Liber aligorismi_ (see Boncompagni's\r\n_Trattati_, II, p. 28). So Ramus (_Libri II_, 1569 ed., p. 1) says:\r\n\"Circulus quæ nota est ultima: nil per se significat.\" (See also the\r\nSchonerus ed. of Ramus, 1586, p. 1.)\r\n\r\n[235] \"Und wirt das ringlein o. die Ziffer genant die nichts bedeut.\"\r\n[Köbel's _Rechenbuch_, 1549 ed., f. 10, and other editions.]\r\n\r\n[236] I.e. \"circular figure,\" our word _notation_ having come from the\r\nmedieval _nota_. Thus Tzwivel (1507, f. 2) says: \"Nota autem circularis .o.\r\nper se sumpta nihil vsus habet. alijs tamen adiuncta earum significantiam\r\net auget et ordinem permutat quantum quo ponit ordinem. vt adiuncta note\r\nbinarij hoc modo 20 facit eam significare bis decem etc.\" Also (ibid., f.\r\n4), \"figura circularis,\" \"circularis nota.\" Clichtoveus (1503 ed., f.\r\nXXXVII) calls it \"nota aut circularis o,\" \"circularis nota,\" and \"figura\r\ncircularis.\" Tonstall (1522, f. B_3) says of it: \"Decimo uero nota ad\r\nformam [symbol] litteræ circulari figura est: quam alij circulum, uulgus\r\ncyphram uocat,\" and later (f. C_4) speaks of the \"circulos.\" Grammateus, in\r\nhis _Algorismus de integris_ (Erfurt, 1523, f. A_2), speaking of the nine\r\nsignificant figures, remarks: \"His autem superadditur decima figura\r\ncircularis ut 0 existens que ratione sua nihil significat.\" Noviomagus (_De\r\nNumeris libri II_, Paris, 1539, chap. xvi, \"De notis numerorum, quas\r\nzyphras vocant\") calls it \"circularis nota, quam ex his solam, alij\r\nsipheram, Georgius Valla zyphram.\"\r\n\r\n[237] Huswirt, as above. Ramus (_Scholae mathematicae_, 1569 ed., p. 112)\r\ndiscusses the name interestingly, saying: \"Circulum appellamus cum multis,\r\nquam alii thecam, alii figuram nihili, alii figuram privationis, seu\r\nfiguram nullam vocant, alii ciphram, cùm tamen hodie omnes hæ notæ vulgò\r\nciphræ nominentur, & his notis numerare idem sit quod ciphrare.\" Tartaglia\r\n(1592 ed., f. 9) says: \"si chiama da alcuni tecca, da alcuni circolo, da\r\naltri cifra, da altri zero, & da alcuni altri nulla.\"\r\n\r\n[238] \"Quare autem aliis nominibus vocetur, non dicit auctor, quia omnia\r\nalia nomina habent rationem suae lineationis sive figurationis. Quia\r\nrotunda est, dicitur haec figura teca ad similitudinem tecae. Teca enim est\r\nferrum figurae rotundae, quod ignitum solet in quibusdam regionibus imprimi\r\nfronti vel maxillae furis seu latronum.\" [Loc. cit., p. 26.] But in Greek\r\n_theca_ ([THEKE], [Greek: thêkê]) is a place to put something, a\r\nreceptacle. If a vacant column, e.g. in the abacus, was so called, the\r\ninitial might have given the early forms [symbol] and [symbol] for the\r\nzero.\r\n\r\n[239] Buteo, _Logistica_, Lyons, 1559. See also Wertheim in the\r\n_Bibliotheca Mathematica_, 1901, p. 214.\r\n\r\n[240] \"0 est appellee chiffre ou nulle ou figure de nulle valeur.\" [La\r\nRoche, _L'arithmétique_, Lyons, 1520.]\r\n\r\n[241] \"Decima autem figura nihil uocata,\" \"figura nihili (quam etiam cifram\r\nuocant).\" [Stifel, _Arithmetica integra_, 1544, f. 1.]\r\n\r\n[242] \"Zifra, & Nulla uel figura Nihili.\" [Scheubel, 1545, p. 1 of ch. 1.]\r\n_Nulla_ is also used by Italian writers. Thus Sfortunati (1545 ed., f. 4)\r\nsays: \"et la decima nulla & e chiamata questa decima zero;\" Cataldi (1602,\r\np. 1): \"La prima, che è o, si chiama nulla, ouero zero, ouero niente.\" It\r\nalso found its way into the Dutch arithmetics, e.g. Raets (1576, 1580 ed.,\r\nf. A_3): \"Nullo dat ist niet;\" Van der Schuere (1600, 1624 ed., f. 7);\r\nWilkens (1669 ed., p. 1). In Germany Johann Albert (Wittenberg, 1534) and\r\nRudolff (1526) both adopted the Italian _nulla_ and popularized it. (See\r\nalso Kuckuck, _Die Rechenkunst im sechzehnten Jahrhundert_, Berlin, 1874,\r\np. 7; Günther, _Geschichte_, p. 316.)\r\n\r\n[243] \"La dixième s'appelle chifre vulgairement: les vns l'appellant zero:\r\nnous la pourrons appeller vn Rien.\" [Peletier, 1607 ed., p. 14.]\r\n\r\n[244] It appears in the Polish arithmetic of K[=l]os (1538) as _cyfra_.\r\n\"The Ciphra 0 augmenteth places, but of himselfe signifieth not,\" Digges,\r\n1579, p. 1. Hodder (10th ed., 1672, p. 2) uses only this word (cypher or\r\ncipher), and the same is true of the first native American arithmetic,\r\nwritten by Isaac Greenwood (1729, p. 1). Petrus de Dacia derives _cyfra_\r\nfrom circumference. \"Vocatur etiam cyfra, quasi circumfacta vel\r\ncircumferenda, quod idem est, quod circulus non habito respectu ad\r\ncentrum.\" [Loc. cit., p. 26.]\r\n\r\n[245] _Opera mathematica_, 1695, Oxford, Vol. I, chap. ix, _Mathesis\r\nuniversalis_, \"De figuris numeralibus,\" pp. 46-49; Vol. II, _Algebra_, p.\r\n10.\r\n\r\n[246] Martin, _Origine de notre système de numération écrite_, note 149, p.\r\n36 of reprint, spells [Greek: tsiphra] from Maximus Planudes, citing Wallis\r\nas an authority. This is an error, for Wallis gives the correct form as\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nAlexander von Humboldt, \"Über die bei verschiedenen Völkern üblichen\r\nSysteme von Zahlzeichen und über den Ursprung des Stellenwerthes in den\r\nindischen Zahlen,\" Crelle's _Journal für reine und angewandte Mathematik_,\r\nVol. IV, 1829, called attention to the work [Greek: arithmoi Indikoi] of\r\nthe monk Neophytos, supposed to be of the fourteenth century. In this work\r\nthe forms [Greek: tzuphra] and [Greek: tzumphra] appear. See also Boeckh,\r\n_De abaco Graecorum_, Berlin, 1841, and Tannery, \"Le Scholie du moine\r\nNéophytos,\" _Revue Archéologique_, 1885, pp. 99-102. Jordan, loc. cit.,\r\ngives from twelfth and thirteenth century manuscripts the forms _cifra_,\r\n_ciffre_, _chifras_, and _cifrus_. Du Cange, _Glossarium mediae et infimae\r\nLatinitatis_, Paris, 1842, gives also _chilerae_. Dasypodius,\r\n_Institutiones Mathematicae_, Strassburg, 1593-1596, adds the forms\r\n_zyphra_ and _syphra_. Boissière, _L'art d'arythmetique contenant toute\r\ndimention, tres-singulier et commode, tant pour l'art militaire que autres\r\ncalculations_, Paris, 1554: \"Puis y en a vn autre dict zero lequel ne\r\ndesigne nulle quantité par soy, ains seulement les loges vuides.\"\r\n\r\n[247] _Propagation_, pp. 27, 234, 442. Treutlein, \"Das Rechnen im 16.\r\nJahrhundert,\" _Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der Mathematik_, Vol. I, p. 5,\r\nfavors the same view. It is combated by many writers, e.g. A. C. Burnell,\r\nloc. cit., p. 59. Long before Woepcke, I. F. and G. I. Weidler, _De\r\ncharacteribus numerorum vulgaribus et eorum aetatibus_, Wittenberg, 1727,\r\nasserted the possibility of their introduction into Greece by Pythagoras or\r\none of his followers: \"Potuerunt autem ex oriente, uel ex phoenicia, ad\r\ngraecos traduci, uel Pythagorae, uel eius discipulorum auxilio, cum aliquis\r\neo, proficiendi in literis causa, iter faceret, et hoc quoque inuentum\r\naddisceret.\"\r\n\r\n[248] E.g., they adopted the Greek numerals in use in Damascus and Syria,\r\nand the Coptic in Egypt. Theophanes (758-818 A.D.), _Chronographia_,\r\nScriptores Historiae Byzantinae, Vol. XXXIX, Bonnae, 1839, p. 575, relates\r\nthat in 699 A.D. the caliph Wal[=i]d forbade the use of the Greek language\r\nin the bookkeeping of the treasury of the caliphate, but permitted the use\r\nof the Greek alphabetic numerals, since the Arabs had no convenient number\r\nnotation: [Greek: kai ekôluse graphesthai Hellênisti tous dêmosious tôn\r\nlogothesiôn kôdikas, all' Arabiois auta parasêmainesthai, chôris tôn\r\npsêphôn, epeidê adunaton têi ekeinôn glôssêi monada ê duada ê triada ê oktô\r\nhêmisu ê tria graphesthai; dio kai heôs sêmeron eisin sun autois notarioi\r\nChristianoi.] The importance of this contemporaneous document was pointed\r\nout by Martin, loc. cit.

The numeral forms are [symbols], 20 being indicated by [symbol\r\nwith dot] and 200 by [symbol with 2 dots]. This scheme of zero dots was\r\nalso adopted by the Byzantine Greeks, for a manuscript of Planudes in the\r\nBibliothèque Nationale has numbers like [pi alpha with 4 dots] for\r\n8,100,000,000. See Gerhardt, _Études_, p. 19. Pihan, _Exposé_ etc., p. 208,\r\ngives two forms, Asiatic and Maghrebian, of \"Ghob[=a]r\" numerals.\r\n\r\n[256] See Chap.

G. Wilkinson, _The Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians_,\r\nrevised by S. Birch, London, 1878, Vol. II, p. 493, plate XVI.\r\n\r\n[273] There is an extensive literature on this \"Boethius-Frage.\" The reader\r\nwho cares to go fully into it should consult the various volumes of the\r\n_Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik_.\r\n\r\n[274] This title was first applied to Roman emperors in posthumous coins of\r\nJulius Cæsar. Subsequently the emperors assumed it during their own\r\nlifetimes, thus deifying themselves. See F. Gnecchi, _Monete romane_, 2d\r\ned., Milan, 1900, p. 299.\r\n\r\n[275] This is the common spelling of the name, although the more correct\r\nLatin form is Boëtius. See Harper's _Dict. of Class. Lit. and Antiq._, New\r\nYork, 1897, Vol. I, p. 213. There is much uncertainty as to his life. A\r\ngood summary of the evidence is given in the last two editions of the\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_.\r\n\r\n[276] His father, Flavius Manlius Boethius, was consul in 487.\r\n\r\n[277] There is, however, no good historic evidence of this sojourn in\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\n[278] His arithmetic is dedicated to Symmachus: \"Domino suo patricio\r\nSymmacho Boetius.\" [Friedlein ed., p. 3.]\r\n\r\n[279] It was while here that he wrote _De consolatione philosophiae_.\r\n\r\n[280] It is sometimes given as 525.\r\n\r\n[281] There was a medieval tradition that he was executed because of a work\r\non the Trinity.\r\n\r\n[282] Hence the _Divus_ in his name.\r\n\r\n[283] Thus Dante, speaking of his burial place in the monastery of St.\r\nPietro in Ciel d'Oro, at Pavia, says:\r\n\r\n      \"The saintly soul, that shows\r\n  The world's deceitfulness, to all who hear him,\r\n  Is, with the sight of all the good that is,\r\n  Blest there. The limbs, whence it was driven, lie\r\n  Down in Cieldauro; and from martyrdom\r\n  And exile came it here.\"--_Paradiso_, Canto X.\r\n\r\n[284] Not, however, in the mercantile schools. The arithmetic of Boethius\r\nwould have been about the last book to be thought of in such institutions.\r\nWhile referred to by Bæda (672-735) and Hrabanus Maurus (c. 776-856), it\r\nwas only after Gerbert's time that the _Boëtii de institutione arithmetica\r\nlibri duo_ was really a common work.\r\n\r\n[285] Also spelled Cassiodorius.\r\n\r\n[286] As a matter of fact, Boethius could not have translated any work by\r\nPythagoras on music, because there was no such work, but he did make the\r\ntheories of the Pythagoreans known. Neither did he translate Nicomachus,\r\nalthough he embodied many of the ideas of the Greek writer in his own\r\narithmetic. Gibbon follows Cassiodorus in these statements in his _Decline\r\nand Fall of the Roman Empire_, chap. xxxix. Martin pointed out with\r\npositiveness the similarity of the first book of Boethius to the first five\r\nbooks of Nicomachus.

[Smith, _Rara Arithmetica_, p. 46.] Isaacus\r\nVossius, _Observationes ad Pomponium Melam de situ orbis_, 1658, maintained\r\nthat the Arabs derived these numerals from the west. A learned dissertation\r\nto this effect, but deriving them from the Romans instead of the Greeks,\r\nwas written by Ginanni in 1753 (_Dissertatio mathematica critica de\r\nnumeralium notarum minuscularum origine_, Venice, 1753). See also Mannert,\r\n_De numerorum quos arabicos vocant vera origine Pythagorica_, Nürnberg,\r\n1801. Even as late as 1827 Romagnosi (in his supplement to _Ricerche\r\nstoriche sull' India_ etc., by Robertson, Vol. II, p. 580, 1827) asserted\r\nthat Pythagoras originated them. [R. Bombelli, _L'antica numerazione\r\nitalica_, Rome, 1876, p. 59.] Gow (_Hist. of Greek Math._, p. 98) thinks\r\nthat Iamblichus must have known a similar system in order to have worked\r\nout certain of his theorems, but this is an unwarranted deduction from the\r\npassage given.\r\n\r\n[326] A.

The question was\r\nnext taken up in a large way by Weidler, loc. cit., _De characteribus_\r\netc., 1727, and in _Spicilegium_ etc., 1755.\r\n\r\n[335] The best edition of these works is that of G. Friedlein, _Anicii\r\nManlii Torquati Severini Boetii de institutione arithmetica libri duo, de\r\ninstitutione musica libri quinque. Accedit geometria quae fertur\r\nBoetii_.... Leipzig.... MDCCCLXVII.\r\n\r\n[336] See also P. Tannery, \"Notes sur la pseudo-géometrie de Boèce,\" in\r\n_Bibliotheca Mathematica_, Vol. I (3), p. 39. This is not the geometry in\r\ntwo books in which are mentioned the numerals. There is a manuscript of\r\nthis pseudo-geometry of the ninth century, but the earliest one of the\r\nother work is of the eleventh century (Tannery), unless the Vatican codex\r\nis of the tenth century as Friedlein (p. 372) asserts.\r\n\r\n[337] Friedlein feels that it is partly spurious, but he says: \"Eorum\r\nlibrorum, quos Boetius de geometria scripsisse dicitur, investigare veram\r\ninscriptionem nihil aliud esset nisi operam et tempus perdere.\" [Preface,\r\np. v.] N. Bubnov in the Russian _Journal of the Ministry of Public\r\nInstruction_, 1907, in an article of which a synopsis is given in the\r\n_Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik_ for 1907, asserts that the\r\ngeometry was written in the eleventh century.\r\n\r\n[338] The most noteworthy of these was for a long time Cantor\r\n(_Geschichte_, Vol. I., 3d ed., pp. 587-588), who in his earlier days even\r\nbelieved that Pythagoras had known them. Cantor says (_Die römischen\r\nAgrimensoren_, Leipzig, 1875, p. 130): \"Uns also, wir wiederholen es, ist\r\ndie Geometrie des Boetius echt, dieselbe Schrift, welche er nach Euklid\r\nbearbeitete, von welcher ein Codex bereits in Jahre 821 im  Kloster\r\nReichenau vorhanden war, von welcher ein anderes Exemplar im Jahre 982 zu\r\nMantua in die Hände Gerbert's gelangte, von welcher mannigfache\r\nHandschriften noch heute vorhanden sind.\" But against this opinion of the\r\nantiquity of MSS. containing these numerals is the important statement of\r\nP. Tannery, perhaps the most critical of modern historians of mathematics,\r\nthat none exists earlier than the eleventh century. See also J. L. Heiberg\r\nin _Philologus, Zeitschrift f. d. klass. Altertum_, Vol. XLIII, p. 508.\r\n\r\nOf Cantor's predecessors, Th. H. Martin was one of the most prominent, his\r\nargument for authenticity appearing in the _Revue Archéologique_  for\r\n1856-1857, and in his treatise _Les signes numéraux_ etc. See also M.\r\nChasles, \"De la connaissance qu'ont eu les anciens d'une numération\r\ndécimale écrite qui fait usage de neuf chiffres prenant les valeurs de\r\nposition,\" _Comptes rendus_, Vol. VI, pp. 678-680; \"Sur l'origine de notre\r\nsystème de numération,\" _Comptes rendus_, Vol. VIII, pp. 72-81; and note\r\n\"Sur le passage du premier livre de la géométrie de Boèce, relatif à un\r\nnouveau système de numération,\" in his work _Aperçu historique sur\r\nl'origine et le devéloppement des méthodes en géométrie_, of which the\r\nfirst edition appeared in 1837.\r\n\r\n[339] J.

Marquardt, _La vie privée des Romains_, Vol. II (French trans.),\r\np. 505, Paris, 1893.\r\n\r\n[341] In a Plimpton manuscript of the arithmetic of Boethius of the\r\nthirteenth century, for example, the Roman numerals are all replaced by the\r\nArabic, and the same is true in the first printed edition of the book. (See\r\nSmith's _Rara Arithmetica_, pp. 434, 25-27.) D. E. Smith also copied from a\r\nmanuscript of the arithmetic in the Laurentian library at Florence, of\r\n1370, the following forms, [Forged numerals\r\n\r\n[342] Halliwell, in his _Rara Mathematica, _p. 107, states that the\r\ndisputed passage is not in a manuscript belonging to Mr. Ames, nor in one\r\nat Trinity College. See also Woepcke, in _Propagation_, pp. 37 and 42. It\r\nwas the evident corruption of the texts in such editions of Boethius as\r\nthose of Venice, 1499, Basel, 1546 and 1570, that led Woepcke to publish\r\nhis work _Sur l'introduction de l'arithmétique indienne en Occident_.\r\n\r\n[343] They are found in none of the very ancient manuscripts, as, for\r\nexample, in the ninth-century (?) codex in the Laurentian library which one\r\nof the authors has examined. It should be said, however, that the disputed\r\npassage was written after the arithmetic, for it contains a reference to\r\nthat work. See the Friedlein ed., p. 397.\r\n\r\n[344] Smith, _Rara Arithmetica_, p. 66.\r\n\r\n[345] J. L. Heiberg, _Philologus_, Vol. XLIII, p. 507.\r\n\r\n[346] \"Nosse autem huius artis dispicientem, quid sint digiti, quid\r\narticuli, quid compositi, quid incompositi numeri.\" [Friedlein ed., p.\r\n395.]\r\n\r\n[347] _De ratione abaci._ In this he describes \"quandam formulam, quam ob\r\nhonorem sui praeceptoris mensam Pythagoream nominabant ... a posterioribus\r\nappellabatur abacus.\" This, as pictured in the text, is the common Gerbert\r\nabacus. In the edition in Migne's _Patrologia Latina_, Vol. LXIII, an\r\nordinary multiplication table (sometimes called Pythagorean abacus) is\r\ngiven in the illustration.\r\n\r\n[348] \"Habebant enim diverse formatos apices vel caracteres.\" See the\r\nreference to Gerbert on p. 117.\r\n\r\n[349] C. Henry, \"Sur l'origine de quelques notations mathématiques,\" _Revue\r\nArchéologique_, 1879, derives these from the initial letters used as\r\nabbreviations for the names of the numerals, a theory that finds few\r\nsupporters.\r\n\r\n[350] E.g., it appears in Schonerus, _Algorithmus Demonstratus_, Nürnberg,\r\n1534, f. A4. In England it appeared in the earliest English arithmetical\r\nmanuscript known, _The Crafte of Nombrynge_: \"¶ fforthermore ye most\r\nvndirstonde that in this craft ben vsid teen figurys, as here bene writen\r\nfor ensampul, [Numerals] ... in the quych we vse teen figurys of Inde.\r\nQuestio. ¶ why ten fyguris of Inde?

He relates how\r\naffectionately the abbot received him, asking if there were men in Spain\r\nwell versed in the arts. Upon Borel's reply in the affirmative, the abbot\r\nasked that one of his young men might accompany him upon his return, that\r\nhe might carry on his studies there.\r\n\r\n[436] Vicus Ausona. Hatto also appears as Atton and Hatton.\r\n\r\n[437] This is all that we know of his sojourn in Spain, and this comes from\r\nhis pupil Richer. The stories told by Adhemar of Chabanois, an apparently\r\nignorant and certainly untrustworthy contemporary, of his going to Cordova,\r\nare unsupported. (See e.g. Picavet, p. 34.) Nevertheless this testimony is\r\nstill accepted: K. von Raumer, for example (_Geschichte der Pädagogik_, 6th\r\ned., 1890, Vol. I, p. 6), says \"Mathematik studierte man im Mittelalter bei\r\nden Arabern in Spanien. Zu ihnen gieng Gerbert, nachmaliger Pabst Sylvester\r\nII.\"\r\n\r\n[438] Thus in a letter to Aldaberon he says: \"Quos post repperimus\r\nsperetis, id est VIII volumina Boeti de astrologia, praeclarissima quoque\r\nfigurarum geometriæ, aliaque non minus admiranda\" (Epist. 8). Also in a\r\nletter to Rainard (Epist. 130), he says: \"Ex tuis sumptibus fac ut michi\r\nscribantur M. Manlius (Manilius in one MS.) de astrologia.\"\r\n\r\n[439] Picavet, loc. cit., p. 31.\r\n\r\n[440] Picavet, loc. cit., p. 36.\r\n\r\n[441] Havet, loc. cit., p. vii.\r\n\r\n[442] Picavet, loc. cit., p. 37.\r\n\r\n[443] \"Con sinistre arti conseguri la dignita del Pontificato....

When Olleris (_Oeuvres de Gerbert_,\r\nParis, 1867, p. cci) says, \"C'est à lui et non point aux Arabes, que\r\nl'Europe doit son système et ses signes de numération,\" he exaggerates,\r\nsince the evidence is all against his knowing the place value. Friedlein\r\nemphasizes this in the _Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik_, Vol. XII\r\n(1867), _Literaturzeitung_, p. 70: \"Für das _System_ unserer Numeration ist\r\ndie _Null_ das wesentlichste Merkmal, und diese kannte Gerbert nicht. Er\r\nselbst schrieb alle Zahlen mit den römischen Zahlzeichen und man kann ihm\r\nalso nicht verdanken, was er selbst nicht kannte.\"\r\n\r\n[449] E.g., Chasles, Büdinger, Gerhardt, and Richer. So Martin (_Recherches\r\nnouvelles_ etc.) believes that Gerbert received them from Boethius or his\r\nfollowers. See Woepcke, _Propagation_, p. 41.\r\n\r\n[450] Büdinger, loc. cit., p. 10.

Those touching\r\nmathematical topics were edited by Bubnov, loc. cit., pp. 98-106.\r\n\r\n[454] He published it in the _Monumenta Germaniae historica_, \"Scriptores,\"\r\nVol. III, and at least three other editions have since appeared, viz. those\r\nby Guadet in 1845, by Poinsignon in 1855, and by Waitz in 1877.\r\n\r\n[455] Domino ac beatissimo Patri Gerberto, Remorum archiepiscopo, Richerus\r\nMonchus, Gallorum congressibus in volumine regerendis, imperii tui, pater\r\nsanctissime Gerberte, auctoritas seminarium dedit.\r\n\r\n[456] In epistle 17 (Havet collection) he speaks of the \"De multiplicatione\r\net divisione numerorum libellum a Joseph Ispano editum abbas Warnerius\" (a\r\nperson otherwise unknown). In epistle 25 he says: \"De multiplicatione et\r\ndivisione numerorum, Joseph Sapiens sententias quasdam edidit.\"\r\n\r\n[457] H.

Steinschneider, in _Bibliotheca Mathematica_, 1893, p.\r\n68. Wallis (_Algebra_, 1685, chap. 14) went over the list of Spanish\r\nJosephs very carefully, but could find nothing save that \"Josephus Hispanus\r\nseu Josephus sapiens videtur aut Maurus fuisse aut alius quis in Hispania.\"\r\n\r\n[458] P. Ewald, _Mittheilungen, Neues Archiv d. Gesellschaft für ältere\r\ndeutsche Geschichtskunde_, Vol. VIII, 1883, pp. 354-364. One of the\r\nmanuscripts is of 976 A.D. and the other of 992 A.D.

The forms are reproduced in the plate on page 140.\r\n\r\n[459] It is entitled _Constantino suo Gerbertus scolasticus_, because it\r\nwas addressed to Constantine, a monk of the Abbey of Fleury. The text of\r\nthe letter to Constantine, preceding the treatise on the Abacus, is given\r\nin the _Comptes rendus_, Vol. XVI (1843), p. 295. This book seems to have\r\nbeen written c. 980 A.D.

See _Zeitschrift für Mathematik und\r\nPhysik_, Vol. XII (1867), Hist.-lit. suppl., p. 74. It was discovered in\r\nthe library of the Benedictine monastry of St. Peter, at Salzburg, and was\r\npublished by Peter Bernhard Pez in 1721. Doubt was first cast upon it in\r\nthe Olleris edition (_Oeuvres de Gerbert_). See Weissenborn, _Gerbert_, pp.\r\n2, 6, 168, and Picavet, p. 81. Hock, Cantor, and Th. Martin place the\r\ncomposition of the work at c. 996 when Gerbert was in Germany, while\r\nOlleris and Picavet refer it to the period when he was at Rheims.\r\n\r\n[463] Picavet, loc. cit., p. 182.\r\n\r\n[464] Who wrote after Gerbert became pope, for he uses, in his preface, the\r\nwords, \"a domino pape Gerberto.\" He was quite certainly not later than the\r\neleventh century; we do not have exact information about the time in which\r\nhe lived.\r\n\r\n[465] Picavet, loc. cit., p. 182. Weissenborn, _Gerbert_, p. 227. In\r\nOlleris, _Liber Abaci_ (of Bernelinus), p. 361.\r\n\r\n[466] Richer, in Bubnov, loc. cit., p. 381.\r\n\r\n[467] Weissenborn, _Gerbert_, p. 241.\r\n\r\n[468] Writers on numismatics are quite uncertain as to their use. See F.\r\nGnecchi, _Monete Romane_, 2d ed., Milan, 1900, cap. XXXVII. For pictures of\r\nold Greek tesserae of Sarmatia, see S. Ambrosoli, _Monete Greche_, Milan,\r\n1899, p. 202.\r\n\r\n[469] Thus Tzwivel's arithmetic of 1507, fol. 2, v., speaks of the ten\r\nfigures as \"characteres sive numerorum apices a diuo Seuerino Boetio.\"\r\n\r\n[470] Weissenborn uses _sipos_ for 0. It is not given by Bernelinus, and\r\nappears in Radulph of Laon, in the twelfth century. See Günther's\r\n_Geschichte_, p. 98, n.; Weissenborn, p. 11; Pihan, _Exposé_ etc., pp.\r\nxvi-xxii.\r\n\r\nIn Friedlein's _Boetius_, p. 396, the plate shows that all of the six\r\nimportant manuscripts from which the illustrations are taken contain the\r\nsymbol, while four out of five which give the words use the word _sipos_\r\nfor 0. The names appear in a twelfth-century anonymous manuscript in the\r\nVatican, in a passage beginning\r\n\r\n  Ordine primigeno sibi nomen possidet igin.\r\n  Andras ecce locum mox uendicat ipse secundum\r\n  Ormis post numeros incompositus sibi primus.\r\n\r\n[Boncompagni _Buttetino_, XV, p. 132.] Turchill (twelfth century) gives the\r\nnames Igin, andras, hormis, arbas, quimas, caletis, zenis, temenias,\r\ncelentis, saying: \"Has autem figuras, ut donnus [dominus] Gvillelmus Rx\r\ntestatur, a pytagoricis habemus, nomina uero ab arabibus.\" (Who the William\r\nR. was is not known. Boncompagni _Bulletino_ XV, p. 136.) Radulph of Laon\r\n(d. 1131) asserted that they were Chaldean (_Propagation_, p. 48 n.). A\r\ndiscussion of the whole question is also given in E. C. Bayley, loc. cit.\r\nHuet, writing in 1679, asserted that they were of Semitic origin, as did\r\nNesselmann in spite of his despair over ormis, calctis, and celentis; see\r\nWoepcke, _Propagation_, p. 48. The names were used as late as the fifteenth\r\ncentury, without the zero, but with the superscript dot for 10's, two dots\r\nfor 100's, etc., as among the early Arabs. Gerhardt mentions having seen a\r\nfourteenth or fifteenth century manuscript in the Bibliotheca Amploniana\r\nwith the names \"Ingnin, andras, armis, arbas, quinas, calctis, zencis,\r\nzemenias, zcelentis,\" and the statement \"Si unum punctum super ingnin\r\nponitur, X significat.... Si duo puncta super ... figuras superponunter,\r\nfiet decuplim illius quod cum uno puncto significabatur,\" in\r\n_Monatsberichte der K. P. Akad. d.

In the first arithmetic by an\r\nAmerican (Greenwood, 1729) the author speaks of \"a few Arabian _Charecters_\r\nor Numeral Figures, called _Digits_\" (p. 1), and as late as 1790, in the\r\nthird edition of J. J. Blassière's arithmetic (1st ed. 1769), the name\r\n_characters_ is still in use, both for \"de Latynsche en de Arabische\" (p.\r\n4), as is also the term \"Cyfferletters\" (p. 6, n.). _Ziffer_, the modern\r\nGerman form of cipher, was commonly used to designate any of the nine\r\nfigures, as by Boeschenstein and Riese, although others, like Köbel, used\r\nit only for the zero. So _zifre_ appears in the arithmetic by Borgo, 1550\r\ned. In a Munich codex of the twelfth century, attributed to Gerland, they\r\nare called _characters_ only: \"Usque ad VIIII. enim porrigitur omnis\r\nnumerus et qui supercrescit eisdem designator Karacteribus.\" [Boncompagni\r\n_Bulletino_, Vol. X. p. 607.]\r\n\r\n[474] The title of his work is _Prologus N. Ocreati in Helceph_ (Arabic\r\n_al-qeif_, investigation or memoir) _ad Adelardum Batensem magistrum suum_.\r\nThe work was made known by C. Henry, in the _Zeitschrift für Mathematik und\r\nPhysik_, Vol. XXV, p. 129, and in the _Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der\r\nMathematik_, Vol. III; Weissenborn, _Gerbert_, p. 188.\r\n\r\n[475] The zero is indicated by a vacant column.\r\n\r\n[476] Leo Jordan, loc. cit., p. 170. \"Chifre en augorisme\" is the\r\nexpression used, while a century later \"giffre en argorisme\" and \"cyffres\r\nd'augorisme\" are similarly used.\r\n\r\n[477] _The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer_, edited by W.
