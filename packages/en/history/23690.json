APRIL, 1847. VOL. LXI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROMWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Carlyle's services to history in collecting and editing these\r\nletters[1] and speeches of Cromwell, all men will readily and gratefully\r\nacknowledge. A work more valuable as a guide to the study of the\r\nsingular and complex character of our pious revolutionist, our religious\r\ndemagogue, our preaching and praying warrior and usurper, has not been\r\nproduced. There is another portion of Mr Carlyle's labours which will\r\nnot meet so unanimous an approbation. As _editor_, Mr Carlyle has given\r\nus a valuable work; as _commentator_, the view which he would teach us\r\nto take of English Puritanism is, to our thinking, simply the most\r\nparadoxical, absurd, unintelligible, mad business we ever encountered in\r\nour lives.\r\n\r\nOur Hero-worshipper, it must be allowed, has been more fortunate this\r\ntime in the selection of his object of devotion than when he shouted to\r\nthe skies his Mirabeaus and Dantons. But he makes an unfortunate species\r\nof compensation. In proportion as his hero is more within the bounds of\r\nhumanity has his worship become more extravagant and outrageous. He\r\nout-puritans the Puritans; he is more fanatic than his idol; he has\r\nchosen to express himself with such a righteous truculence, such a\r\nsanguinary zeal, such a pious contempt for human virtue and human\r\nsympathies, as would have startled Old Noll himself. It is a bad\r\nreligion this hero-worship--at least as practised by Mr Carlyle. Here is\r\nour amiable countryman rendered by it, in turn, a terrorist and a\r\nfanatic. All his own intellectual culture he throws down and abandons.\r\nSuch dire transformation ensues as reminds us of a certain hero-worship\r\nwhich Milton has celebrated:\r\n\r\n                    \"Horror on him falls,\r\n    _And horrid sympathy_; for what he sees\r\n    He feels himself, now changing; down his arms,\r\n    Down falls the spear and shield; down he as fast;\r\n    And the dire hiss renews, and the dire form,\r\n    Catched by contagion.\"\r\n\r\nBut to our task--which is no light one; for in our survey of this book\r\nwe have to keep in view both hero and hero-worshipper, Cromwell and\r\nCarlyle, both somewhat slippery personages, abnormal, enigmatical.\r\n\r\nThe speeches of Oliver Cromwell have a formidable reputation for\r\nprolixity, confusion, and excessive tediousness; yet we have not, for\r\nour own part, found these volumes to be of the dry and scarce readable\r\ndescription which their title foreboded; and we would caution others not\r\nto be deterred by any fears of this nature from their perusal. They will\r\nfind an interest grow upon them as they proceed, and the last volume to\r\nbe more attractive than the first. As the work advances, the letters and\r\nspeeches of Cromwell become more intimately connected with the great\r\ntransactions of the period, and the editor himself more frequently\r\nfavours us with some specimen of his happier manner, where concentration\r\nof style, a spirit of humour and reflection, and a power of vivid\r\nportraiture, have _not_ degenerated into mere quaintness, into a species\r\nof slang, into _Carlylisms_, into vague generalities about infinitudes\r\nand eternities. At all times the interspersed commentary--written in\r\nthat peculiar, fantastic, jingling manner which, illegitimate as it is,\r\ndisorderly and scandalous to all lovers of propriety in style and\r\ndiction, is at all events the very opposite to dulness--forms perhaps\r\nthe most fortunate contrast that could have been devised with the\r\nCromwellian period, so arid and colourless, so lengthy and so tortuous,\r\ntinged often with such a dismal obscurity, and valuable in fact only as\r\nshowing _the man_, utterly valueless as an exposition of thought.\r\nPerhaps, as models of style, a critic would be as little disposed to\r\napplaud the writing of Mr Carlyle as the compositions of Cromwell, but\r\nthey form here all admirable relief the one to the other; taken\r\ntogether, one can consume a considerable quantity of both. Your dry\r\nbread is weary mastication, and your potted anchovies have a somewhat\r\ntoo stinging flavour; but taken together, sandwich-fashion, as they are\r\nhere, the consumption may go on rapidly enough.\r\n\r\nBut, whether dry or not, the letters and speeches of Cromwell should be\r\nread by every one desirous of obtaining an insight into the character of\r\nnot the least extraordinary, nor the least misrepresented personage in\r\nhistory. If there is any one who still believes that Cromwell was a\r\nthorough hypocrite, that his religion was a systematic feint to cover\r\nhis ambitious designs, the perusal of these volumes will entirely\r\nundeceive him. We look upon this hypothesis, this Machiavelian\r\nexplanation of Cromwell's character, as henceforth entirely dismissed\r\nfrom all candid and intelligent minds. It was quite natural that such a\r\nview should be taken of their terrible enemy by the royalists of the\r\nRestoration, hating his memory with a most cordial hatred, and\r\naccustomed, in their blinding licentiousness, to look upon _all_\r\nreligion as little better than cant and hypocrisy. It was quite natural\r\nthat such a portrait of him should be drawn by the men who unearthed his\r\nbones, and vented their rage upon a senseless corpse. We see it was\r\nquite inevitable that some such coarse caricature should be thus limned\r\nand transmitted to us. But it has lasted long enough. We believe,\r\nindeed, that by most persons it has already been dismissed and disowned.\r\nIt may now be torn into shreds, and cast aside as utterly faithless.\r\n\r\nCromwell was a _genuine Puritan_. There is no doubt of that. He was no\r\nyouth when the war broke out, nor a man who had yet to seek his\r\nreligious party or principles. As the farmer of St Ives, we see him, as\r\ndistinctly as if he still lived upon the earth, the man of fierce\r\nsectarian piety, in natural temper not unamiable, somewhat gloomy and\r\nhypochondriacal, but, above all, distinguished by whatsoever of good or\r\nill the sort of Calvinistic divinity prevalent at the time could infuse\r\ninto its professors. Such the war found him, and such he continued to\r\nbe; throughout his whole career we never for a moment lose sight of \"the\r\nsaint,\" the title which, then as now, the profane world gave to this\r\nclass of men.\r\n\r\nWas Cromwell, then, always sincere in his utterances? was there no cant,\r\n_no_ hypocrisy? Did he never conceal the ambition and domineering spirit\r\nof the soldier under the humility of the saint? Another matter quite.\r\nBecause a man is religious in the main, it follows not that he is\r\nincapable of occasionally practising hypocrisy: he may lapse as well\r\ninto this, as into any crime of the decalogue. Although we might find it\r\ndifficult to put our finger exactly upon the spot, and say, Here speaks\r\nthe hypocrite, we are not without suspicion that Cromwell was at times\r\npractising dissimulation. But if he dissembled, if he used with artifice\r\nthe language of religion, it was no new and foreign disguise that he\r\nput on. He had but to draw the folds a little higher over his face of a\r\nrobe that he had long worn in all times and seasons, and which was\r\nverily his own.\r\n\r\nIn common with almost all men who in times of civil broil have risen\r\nfrom a lowly station to great power, Cromwell had occasion, no doubt, at\r\ntimes for dissimulation. His religion, genuine as it was, would no more\r\nprevent him from the practice of this necessary craft than from the\r\nsanguinary deeds not more necessary to the triumph of his cause. Nay, it\r\nwas precisely of that enthusiastic order which, in the most liberal\r\nmanner, justifies the means for the end. Now, at a period when the\r\nsaints were in the ascendant, dissimulation would unavoidably take a\r\nreligious form, and when most deceiving men, or most faithfully\r\naddressing them, he would still colour all his language with the same\r\nhue of piety. As, in an age of chivalry, the dissembler would have the\r\nboast of honour and the parade of knightly courtesy for ever on his\r\nlips, so in these times of saintship he would lull the suspicions of men\r\nby a gross emblazonry of religion. It might well happen, therefore, that\r\nsuch a man as Cromwell, working his way upward to the highest post of\r\nauthority, would deal in much insincerity of phrase, and yet have \"the\r\nroot of the matter\" in him. Indeed, nothing is more common in the world\r\nthan this combination of genuine feelings of piety with a great\r\nabundance of cant, habitual or designed. It would betray a very slender\r\nknowledge of mankind, and none at all of what is called the religious\r\nworld, to conclude that a man is destitute of sincere piety because he\r\nsometimes makes use of the language of religion for ulterior purposes\r\nnot peculiarly pious.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, moreover, that to readers unfamiliar with the\r\npeculiarities of _professing_ Christians, whether Puritans or of other\r\ndenomination, the expressions of humility and self-abasement which\r\nCromwell frequently makes use of have appeared to be plain symptoms of\r\nhypocrisy. They are nothing but the habits of the sect. Such expressions\r\nare supposed to have been employed to blind men to his ambitious\r\nprojects, to shelter him from the jealous scrutiny of rivals and\r\nsuperiors. Such a purpose they may have sometimes answered, and been\r\nintended to answer; but in the main they are nothing more nor less than\r\nthe dialect of the tribe. Because is a Christian virtue, certain\r\nreligious people have thought fit to indulge in a false vituperation of\r\nthemselves. Striving avariciously after _all_ virtues, however\r\nincompatible the one with the other, they counterfeit vice and meanness,\r\nthat, good men as they are, they may have abundance of contrition. How\r\nfar there can be Christianity or piety in an abuse and degradation of\r\nourselves, when that abuse and degradation must be felt all along to be\r\nuntrue--if any reflection whatever accompanies such language--we leave\r\nsuch people to settle amongst themselves. Certain it is that the\r\nPuritans excelled in this as in every other kindred extravagance. The\r\nelect of the Lord were fond of describing themselves as the most\r\ncontemptible of sinners; the salt of the earth as being rottenness and\r\ncorruption. It is to this habit of unmeaning self-disparagement that we\r\nare to attribute many of those phrases which have been thought in\r\nCromwell to be studied artifices to cloak ambitious designs.\r\n\r\nThey are rife on all occasions, and their frequency and energy bear no\r\nrelation to the supposed exigencies of his political career. Take the\r\nfollowing instance. No man surely knew better than he, that at the\r\nconclusion of the civil war the army had become paramount. He could\r\nsometimes speak of this army with the natural pride of a soldier, with\r\nthe full consciousness of the power it possessed, and had conferred on\r\nhim; and yet, at other times, he would talk of this terrible force in\r\nthe puling strain, in more than the drawl and drivel of the conventicle.\r\nAs Lord High Protector, addressing his first parliament, he says:--\"I\r\nhad the approbation of the officers of the army, in the three nations of\r\nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland. I say of the officers: I had that by\r\ntheir express remonstrances, and under signature. But there went along\r\nwith that express consent of theirs, an implied consent also of a body\r\nof persons who had had somewhat to do in the world; who had been\r\ninstrumental, by God, to fight down the enemies of God, and his people,\r\nin the three nations. And truly, until my hands were bound, and I was\r\nlimited, (to my own great satisfaction, as many can bear me witness,)\r\nwhile I had in my hands so great a power and arbitrariness--the soldiery\r\nwere a very considerable part of these nations, especially all\r\ngovernment being dissolved. I say, when all government was thus\r\ndissolved, and nothing to keep things in order but the sword!\" There can\r\nbe no doubt of it--the soldiery were a very considerable part of the\r\nnation. But the Lord High Protector, in a speech he makes to his second\r\nparliament, referring to the very same period, narrating the very same\r\nevents, can talk of this army as \"a company of poor men,\" \"your poor\r\narmy,\" \"those poor contemptible men.\" To attempt to detect any political\r\nmotive for this absurd phraseology, would be a very idle speculation,\r\nmere waste of ingenuity: he was simply more in the puritanic vein in the\r\none case than the other.\r\n\r\nIn his letters to the parliament, giving an account of his successes in\r\nthe war, he generally concludes with some expression of this strained\r\nevangelical modesty, and seems very much afraid lest Speaker Lenthall\r\nand other honourable members should attribute the victories he\r\nannounces, in any measure to the army and the general who won them. He\r\nmight be very sure, however, that, notwithstanding these\r\nself-renunciations, the parliament knew very well who was fighting their\r\nbattles. Such a mode of speech would not endanger his reputation, nor\r\ndiminish from his claims; might perhaps--though we will not say this was\r\npresent to his thoughts--induce the parliament to presume that _he_\r\nwould not insist on any very egregious reward for services he was so\r\nanxious to disclaim. We will quote one instance of this self-denying\r\nstyle; and perhaps the following passage contains altogether as much of\r\na certain fanatical mode of reasoning as could be well found in so short\r\na compass. Prince Rupert, then at Worcester, had sent two thousand men\r\nacross the country, to his majesty at Oxford, to convoy his majesty's\r\nperson and the artillery over to him at Worcester. Cromwell attacked and\r\nrouted this convoy; he also took Bletchington House. After giving an\r\naccount of the transaction, he continues:--\"This was the mercy of God;\r\nand nothing is more due than a real acknowledgment. And though I have\r\nhad greater mercies, yet none clearer: because, in the first place, God\r\nbrought them to our hands when we looked not for them; and delivered\r\nthem out of our hands, when we laid a reasonable design to surprise\r\nthem, and which we carefully endeavoured. His mercy appears in this\r\nalso, that I did much doubt the storming of the house, it being strong\r\nand well manned, and I having few dragoons, and this being not my\r\nbusiness; and yet we got it. I hope you will pardon me if I say, God is\r\nnot enough owned. _We look too much to men and visible helps_: this hath\r\nmuch hindered our success.\" This from Oliver, who so well knew how \"to\r\nkeep his powder dry!\" from Oliver, who, enthusiast himself, could yet\r\nshrewdly calculate on the military efficacy of enthusiasm, and set it\r\ndown amongst the ways and means! Cant or not, it is sad stuff.\r\n\r\nBut, Puritan as he was, we can admire Cromwell. Every great man, in\r\nwhatever times, or in whatever part of the world he has made his\r\nappearance, has earned his title to fame and distinction, not by\r\nqualities peculiar to the sect or religion to which he may have\r\nbelonged, but qualities which, though connected with his own especial\r\nfaith or tenets, are recognised as the common property of mankind; he\r\nhas been great not as Catholic, as Puritan, as Pagan, as Mahometan, but\r\nas _man_; he has been great, because he was pious, brave, patriotic,\r\nsagacious, resolute, and has achieved great enterprises on the theatre\r\nof life. The greatness of Cromwell was indeed allied to Puritanism,\r\ninasmuch as his mind grew up under this peculiar form of religion; but\r\nwhat we, and all posterity must admire in Cromwell, is by no means the\r\npuritan. His steadiness of purpose, his unshaken resolution, his\r\nmilitary prowess, his eminent talent to govern and command, and his\r\nreligious sense of duty to the Supreme, might all have existed under\r\nother modes of religion. In our admiration we entirely separate these\r\nqualities from that least gainly and least wholesome of the forms of\r\nChristian piety with which they are here found connected. History gives\r\nus examples of every kind of virtue, and every kind of talent, united\r\nwith every species of fanaticism that has afflicted civilised life. It\r\nfollows not that we applaud the fanaticism. The early caliphs were\r\nseveral of them distinguished by exalted virtues, temperance,\r\nself-denial, justice, patriotism: we praise these virtues, we\r\nacknowledge, too, that they are here linked with the profession of the\r\nfaith of Islam; but for all this we do not admire the religion of\r\nMahomet, nor that fanaticism which writ its texts upon the sword.\r\n\r\nWe insist upon this obvious distinction, because, whilst agreeing--_to a\r\ncertain extent_--in Mr Carlyle's view of the character of Cromwell, we\r\nbeg not to be implicated in that esteem and reverence which he professes\r\nto entertain for Puritanism, or the Puritans as a body. And this brings\r\nus to the extraordinary part of Mr Carlyle's performance--his ardent\r\nsympathy, nay his acquiescence with, and adherence to the Puritans, to\r\nthat point that he adopts their convictions, their feelings, and even\r\nsome of their most grotesque reasonings. Their violence and ferocity, we\r\nwere prepared to see Mr Carlyle, in his own sardonic fashion, abet and\r\nencourage; his sympathy is always with the party _who strikes_; but that\r\nhe should identify himself with their mumming thoughts, their \"plentiful\r\nreasons,\" their gloomiest superstitions, was what no one could have\r\nanticipated. On this subject we must quote his own words; our own would\r\nnot be credited; they would seem to any one who had not read his work to\r\nbe scandalous misrepresentations. The extravagance runs through the\r\nwhole book, but we have it perhaps more concentrated in the\r\nIntroduction.\r\n\r\nThis Introduction, which we sat down to with keen expectations,\r\ndisappointed us extremely, at least in those parts where any general\r\nviews are taken. We feel, and have elsewhere ungrudgingly expressed, a\r\ncertain admiration for the talents of Mr Carlyle. We shall never forget\r\nthe surprise and pleasure with which we read the \"Sartor Resartus,\" as\r\nit one day burst suddenly and accidentally upon us; and no one who has\r\nonce read his graphic and passionate history of the French Revolution,\r\ncan ever forget the vivid pictures that were there presented to him. We\r\nopened this book, therefore, with a sort of anticipatory relish. But we\r\nfound very little of his genius, and very much of his extravagance; less\r\nof the one and more of the other, than we thought could possibly have\r\nbeen brought together. Metaphors and allusions, already worn\r\nthread-bare, are introduced as stock phrases, as if he had inserted them\r\nin his dictionary of the English language. All his vices of manner are\r\nexaggerated, while the freshness of thought, which half excused them, is\r\ndeparted. These strange metaphors, these glaring colours, which are\r\nready spread out upon his palette, he transfers with hasty profusion to\r\nhis canvass, till--(as it has been said of Mr Turner's, pictures)--the\r\ncanvass and the palette-plate very nearly resemble. But were it\r\notherwise, were there all and more than the wit, and humour, and\r\nsarcasm, and pungent phrase, and graphic power, which may be found\r\nscattered through Mr Carlyle's best performances, there is here a\r\nsubstratum of sheer and violent absurdity, which all these together\r\nwould fail to disguise or compensate. Certainly there are pages of\r\nwriting in this Introduction which contain such an amount of extravagant\r\nassertion, uttered in such fantastic jargon, as we think could nowhere\r\nbe paralleled. Dulness could never have attained to any thing so\r\nextraordinary; and surely genius never before condescended to such\r\nworkmanship.\r\n\r\n\"What and how great,\" thus commences the book, \"are the interests which\r\nconnect themselves with the hope that England may yet attain to some,\r\npractical belief and understanding of its history during the seventeenth\r\ncentury, need not be insisted on at present, such hope being still very\r\ndistant, very uncertain. We have wandered far away from the ideas which\r\nguided us in that century, _and indeed which had guided us in all\r\npreceding centuries, but of which that century was the ultimate\r\nmanifestation_. We have wandered very far, and must endeavour to return\r\nand connect ourselves therewith again! It is with other feelings than\r\nthose of poor peddling dilettantism, other aims than the writing of\r\nsuccessful or unsuccessful publications, that an earnest man occupies\r\nhimself in those dreary provinces of the dead and buried. The _last\r\nglimpse of the godlike_ vanishing from this England; conviction and\r\nveracity giving place to hollow cant and formalism--antique 'Reign of\r\nGod,' which all true men in their several dialects and modes have always\r\nstriven for, giving place to the modern reign of the No-God, whom men\r\nname devil; this, in its multitudinous meanings and results, is a sight\r\nto create reflections in the earnest man! One wishes there were a\r\nhistory of English Puritanism, _the last of all our heroisms_, but sees\r\nsmall prospect of such a thing at present.\"\r\n\r\nThen, beginning to quote himself, as his manner is, changing his voice\r\nand adopting another key, as if by this thin disguise to obtain somewhat\r\nmore license for the wildness and vehemence of his speech--an artifice\r\nsurely not necessary here--he thus continues:--\r\n\r\n\"'Few nobler heroisms,' says a well-known writer, long occupied on this\r\nsubject, 'at bottom, perhaps, _no nobler heroism_, ever transacted\r\nitself on this earth; and it lies as good as lost to us, overwhelmed\r\nunder such an avalanche of human stupidities as no heroism before ever\r\ndid. Intrinsically and extrinsically it may be considered inaccessible\r\nto these generations. Intrinsically, the spiritual purport of it has\r\nbecome inconceivable, incredible to the modern mind. Extrinsically, the\r\ndocuments and records of it, scattered waste as a shoreless chaos, are\r\nnot legible. They lie there printed, written, to the extent of tons of\r\nsquare miles, as shot-rubbish; unedited, unsorted, not so much as\r\nindexed; full of every conceivable confusion; yielding light to very\r\nfew; yielding darkness, in several sorts, to very many.' ...\r\n\r\n\"'This, then,' continues our impatient friend, 'is the Elysium we\r\nEnglish have provided for our heroes! The Rushworthian Elysium.\r\nDreariest continent of shot-rubbish the eye ever saw. Confusion piled on\r\nconfusion to your utmost horizon's edge; obscure in lurid twilight as of\r\nthe shadow of death; trackless, without index, without finger-post, or\r\nmark of any human foregoer; where your human footstep, if you are still\r\nhuman, echoes bodeful through the gaunt solitude, peopled only by\r\nsomnambulant pedants, dilettants, and doleful creatures, by phantasms,\r\nerrors, inconceivabilities, by nightmares, pasteboard norroys, griffins,\r\nwiverns, and chimeras dire! There, all vanquished, overwhelmed under\r\nsuch waste lumber mountains, the wreck and dead ashes of some six\r\nunbelieving generations, does the age of Cromwell and his Puritans lie\r\nhidden from us. This is what we, for our share, have been able to\r\naccomplish towards keeping _our heroic ones_ in memory.'\"\r\n\r\nAfter some further diatribe against all preceding historians,\r\ncollectors, and editors, he drops his ventriloquism, and, resuming a\r\nsomewhat more natural voice, he proceeds:--\r\n\r\n\"Nay, in addition to the sad state of our historical books, and what\r\nindeed is fundamentally the cause and origin of that, our common\r\nspiritual notions, if any notion of ours may still deserve to be called\r\nspiritual, are fatal to a right understanding of that seventeenth\r\ncentury. _The Christian doctrines, which then dwelt alive in every\r\nheart, have now in a manner died out of all hearts_--very mournful to\r\nbehold--and are not the guidance of this world any more. Nay, worse\r\nstill, the cant of them does yet dwell alive with us, little doubting\r\nthat it is cant, in which fatal intermediate state the eternal\r\nsacredness of this universe itself, of this human life itself, has\r\nfallen dark to the most of us, and we think that, too, a cant and a\r\ncreed.\"\r\n\r\nSo!--as our honest German friend would exclaim, puffing from his mouth\r\nat the same time a huge volume of symbolic smoke. We have withdrawn it\r\nseems, from the path of light ever since the reign of the army and its\r\ngodly officers established A.D. 1649. We must return and connect\r\nourselves therewith; it is our only salvation; though, indeed, if\r\nPuritanism was the manifestation of the ideas of all preceding\r\ncenturies--if the same current of thought can be traced from William the\r\nConqueror to Oliver the conqueror--a very little ingenuity would suffice\r\nto trace the same ideas, the same current of thought, somewhat farther\r\nstill. But this reign of the puritanical army was really \"the last\r\nglimpse of the godlike!\"--it was \"the reign of God!\" and we live under\r\nthe reign of ----, psha! Why, he does not even give us a substantial\r\ndevil, but coins a strange personification of a negative. Such was not\r\nthe devil, by the way, at the time of \"the noblest heroism ever\r\ntransacted on the earth.\" Such a definition of the \"roaring lion,\"\r\nwould, in those days of light and happiness, have procured its author,\r\nat the very least, a trip to Barbadoes. Even Cromwell himself would have\r\n_Barbadoesed_ him.\r\n\r\n\"This last of our heroisms!\" God grant it is the last! It is only out of\r\nanother religious war that another such heroism can arise. If church and\r\ndissent should take up arms, and, instead of controversies carried on in\r\npamphlets, upon tradition and white surplices, should blow out each\r\nother's brains with gunpowder, then Mr Carlyle would see his \"heroic\r\nones\" revive upon the earth.\r\n\r\n\"The Christian doctrines which then dwelt alive in every heart, have now\r\nin a manner died out of all hearts.\" Only the cant of them dwells alive\r\nwith us. The same clear-sighted author, who sees the Christian doctrines\r\nso beautifully and pre-eminently developed in the Ironsides of Cromwell,\r\nin the troopers of Lambert and Harrison, sacking, pillaging,\r\nslaughtering, and in all that tribe of men who ever shed blood the\r\nreadier after prayer-time--men who had dropped from their memory\r\nChrist's own preaching, to fill their mouths with the curses which the\r\nHebrew prophets had been permitted, under a past dispensation, to\r\ndenounce against the enemies of Judea, who had constructed their\r\ntheology out of the darkest parts of the New, and the most fearful\r\nportion of the Old Testament;--this same author, opening his eyes and\r\nears upon his own day and generation, finds that Christianity has died\r\nout of all hearts, and its phraseology, as he expresses himself\r\nelsewhere, \"become mournful to him when spouted as frothy cant from\r\nExeter Hall.\" If Mr Carlyle would visit Exeter Hall, and carry there one\r\ntithe of the determination to approve, that he exhibits in favour of the\r\nPuritan, he would find a Christian piety as sincere, as genuine, and far\r\nmore humane, than his heroes of Naseby, or Dunbar, or Drogheda were\r\nacquainted with. He would see the descendants of his Puritans, relieved,\r\nat least we may say, from the necessity of raising their psalm on the\r\nbattle-field, indulging in none of the ferocities of our nature,\r\nassembling in numerous but peaceful meetings, raising annually, by a\r\nquiet but no contemptible sacrifice, their millions for the\r\ndissemination of Gospel truth. But Mr Carlyle would call this cant; he\r\nsees nothing good, or generous, or high-minded in any portion of the\r\nworld in which he lives; he reserves his sympathies for the past--for\r\nthe men of buckram and broad-sword, who, on a question of church\r\ngovernment, were always ready \"to hew Agag to pieces,\" let Agag stand\r\nfor who, or what number it might.\r\n\r\nIf there is one spectacle more odious than another of all which history\r\npresents to us, whether it take place amongst Mahometan or Christian,\r\nCatholic or Protestant, it is this:--to see men practising all the\r\nterrible brutalities of war, treading down their enemies, doing all that\r\nrage and the worst passions prompt, and doing all amidst exclamations of\r\npiety, devout acknowledgments of submission to Divine will, and\r\nprofessions of gratitude to God. Other religious factions have committed\r\nfar greater atrocities than the Puritans, but nowhere in history is this\r\nsame spectacle exhibited with more distasteful and sickening\r\naccompaniments. The Moslem thanked God upon his sword in at least a\r\nsomewhat soldierly manner; and the Catholic, by the very pomp with which\r\nhe chants his _Te Deum_, somewhat conceals the meaning of his act, and,\r\nkeeping God a little out of sight, makes his mass express the natural\r\nfeeling of a human triumph. But the sleek Puritan, at once grovelling\r\nand presumptuous, mingles with his sanguinary mood all the morbid\r\nsickly conceit, all the crawling affected humility of the conventicle.\r\nAll his bloodsheds are \"mercies,\" and they are granted in answer to his\r\nlong and miserable prayers--prayers which, to a man of rational piety,\r\nsound very much like blasphemies. He carries with him to the\r\nbattle-field, to the siege, to the massacre, not one even of those\r\ngenerous feelings which war itself permits towards a foe. He chooses to\r\ncall his enemy the enemy of God, and kneels before he fights, that the\r\ninexpressible _mercy_ may be granted of cutting his throat!\r\n\r\n\"That the sense of difference between right and wrong,\" says Mr Carlyle,\r\n\"had filled all time and all space for man, and bodied itself forth into\r\na heaven and hell for him,--this constitutes the grand feature of those\r\nPuritan, old-Christian ages; this is the element which stamps them as\r\nheroic, and has rendered their works great, manlike, fruitful to all\r\ngenerations.\" Quite on the contrary. The sense of right and wrong was\r\nobscured, confused, lost sight of, in the promptings of a presumptuous\r\nenthusiasm; and it is exactly _this_ which constitutes the perilous\r\ncharacteristic of such men as the Puritans and Cameronians, and similar\r\nsectaries. How can the sense of right and wrong keep its footing in an\r\nenthusiasm which has brought itself to believe that all its successes\r\nare a direct answer to its prayers? Success becomes the very measure of\r\nright and wrong. The two extremes of Atheism and Fanaticism have met;\r\nthey may both dispense with conscience, and make the event the criterion\r\nof the deed. Hear how the pious heroes of Mr Carlyle reason on one of\r\nthe most solemn occasions of the civil war. The army is remonstrating\r\nwith the Parliament because it appeared slow to shed the blood of their\r\nconquered and captured King, and it actually speaks of the death of\r\nCharles \"as appeasing the wrath of God\" against that sovereign! and bids\r\nthe Parliament \"sadly to consider, as men accountable to the Highest,\"\r\nhow far an accommodation with the King, \"when God hath given him so\r\nclearly into your power to do justice, can be just before God or good\r\nmen.\" The _power_ to do the act is full authority, is absolute command\r\nto do it. What other doctrine could a Caesar Borgia, or an Eccelino, the\r\ntyrant of Padua, desire to be governed, or rather to be manumitted by\r\nfrom all government?\r\n\r\nThe argument drawn from the success given to their cause, is perpetually\r\nin the mouth of Cromwell and of his Puritans. It establishes, without a\r\ndoubt, that they have used the sword justly, and are still further to\r\nuse it. Every \"mercy\" of this kind is in answer to prayer. Basing-House,\r\na private residence, cannot be sacked and plundered, and the inhabitants\r\nput to the sword, but the pious historian of the feat, Mr Peters, adds,\r\nthat it, and the like triumphs, were \"answers to the prayers and\r\ntrophies of the faith of some of God's servants.\" When Greek meets\r\nGreek, when the Scottish Covenanter encounters the English Puritan, and\r\nthe former, being worsted, finds out \"that he had not so learned Christ\r\nas to hang the equity of a cause upon events,\" Cromwell answers, \"Did\r\nnot you solemnly appeal and pray? Did not we do so too? And ought not\r\nyou and we to think, with fear and trembling, of the hand of the Great\r\nGod, in this mighty and strange appearance of His, instead of slightly\r\ncalling it an 'event'? Were not both your and our expectations renewed\r\nfrom time to time, whilst we waited upon God, to see which way He would\r\nmanifest himself upon our appeals? And shall we, after all these our\r\nprayers, fastings, tears, expectations, and solemn appeals, call these\r\nbare 'events'? The Lord pity you.\"\r\n\r\nMen prayed in those days! says Mr Carlyle, \"actually prayed! It was a\r\ncapability old London and its preachers and populations had; to us the\r\nincredibilest.\" Beyond a doubt the Puritans and the Covenanters prayed,\r\nand in such a manner and at such a length, that the strange doctrine on\r\nwhich Southey has founded his \"Curse of Kehama,\" of the essential and\r\nirresistible force of prayer, seems to have got mixed up with their\r\nChristianity.[2] But we do not think that the voice of prayer has quite\r\ndied out amongst us. It is curious to observe what a vivid perception\r\nthis author has for the historical past, and what a voluntary blindness\r\nand deafness for the actually present. It is a fact! he frequently\r\nexclaims, with all the energy of a discoverer,--a fact! that men in\r\nthese ages prayed, and had a religious faith. Our churches and chapels\r\nare not facts. The control--none the worse for being exercised without\r\npike or musket--which the religious public, meeting in that very Exeter\r\nHall, have over the measures of government, and all political\r\ntransactions,--is not a fact. Were he writing, some centuries hence, the\r\nhistory of this our age, he would detect these facts. What facts,\r\nindeed, might he not detect, and what exaggerated significance might he\r\nnot give to them! Why, in those days, he might exclaim, in his\r\nenthusiasm, the very beggars in the street, in asking charity, poured\r\nGod's blessing on you! It was a credible thing, in those days, God's\r\nblessing!--and men gave their money for it!\r\n\r\nA passage in one of Cromwell's letters instances, in rather a touching\r\nmanner, what school of piety this army of saints must have proved. At\r\nthe battle of Marston Moor a Colonel Walton had lost his son. \"He was a\r\ngallant young man, exceedingly gracious,\" and Cromwell, giving an\r\naccount of his death, in his consolatory letter to the father, writes\r\nthus,--\"A little after, he said, one thing lay upon his spirit. I asked\r\nhim what that was. He told me it was that God had not suffered him to be\r\nany more _the executioner of his enemies!_\"\r\n\r\nBut nothing disturbs the equanimity of our editor, or interrupts his\r\nflow of rapture over the fanaticism of these times, especially when\r\nexpressed in the letters of Cromwell. Over the theological effusions\r\nwhich the general of the Puritan army addresses, from his camp, to the\r\nEdinburgh clergy, Mr Carlyle thus expatiates:--\"Dryasdust, carrying his\r\nlearned eye over these, and the like letters, finds them, of course,\r\nfull of 'hypocrisy,' &c. Unfortunate Dryasdust! they are corruscations\r\nterrible as lightning, and beautiful as lightning, from the innermost\r\ntemple of the human soul; intimations, still credible, of what a human\r\nsoul does mean when it _believes_ in the Highest--a thing poor Dryasdust\r\nnever did, nor will do. The hapless generation that now reads these\r\nwords ought to hold its peace when it has read them, and sink into\r\nunutterable reflections, not unmixed with tears, and some substitute for\r\n'sackcloth and ashes,' if it liked. In its poor canting, sniffling,\r\nflimsy vocabulary, there is no word that can make any response to them.\r\nThis man has a living God-inspired soul in him, not an enchanted\r\nartificial 'substitute for salt,' as our fashion is. They that have\r\nhuman eyes can look at him; they that have only owl-eyes need not.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then follows something upon _light_ and _lightning_. \"As lightning\r\nis to light, so is a Cromwell to a Shakspere. The light is beautifuller.\r\nAh, yes; but, until by lightning and other fierce labour your foul chaos\r\nhas become a world, you cannot have any light, or the smallest chance\r\nfor any!... The melodious speaker is great, but the melodious worker is\r\ngreater than he. Our Time cannot speak at all, but only cant and sneer,\r\nand argumentatively jargon and recite the multiplication-table:\r\nneither, as yet, can it work, except at mere railroads and\r\ncotton-spinning. It will, apparently, return to chaos soon, and then\r\nmore lightnings will be needed, lightning enough,--to which Cromwell's\r\nwas but a mild matter,--to be followed by light, we may hope!\"--by\r\nanother Shakspeare, as the tenor of the passage would imply.\r\n\r\nStrange jumble this of Cromwell and Shakspeare, of light and lightning!\r\nThere is one species of light which we are often reminded of here; a\r\ncertain fitful, flickering beam, which partakes indeed of a luminous\r\nnature, but which chooses its path for ever over bottomless bog.\r\n\r\nThe sincerity of Oliver Cromwell, in these his letters and speeches, has\r\nbeen questioned and discussed; the sincerity of their present editor may\r\nbecome a question at least as difficult and perplexing. Is there any\r\ngenuine conviction at the bottom of all this rant and raving? Our\r\nextravagant worshipper of the \"old heathen\" Goethe, stands forth the\r\nchampion and admirer of certain harsh, narrow-thoughted, impetuous\r\nsectaries, proclaims _them_ the only \"Reformers\" of the world; descends\r\nto their lowest prejudices, to their saddest bigotries, to their gloomy\r\npuerilities; arguing with them solemnly against the sinfulness of\r\ndrinking healths, and quite fraternising with them in all their\r\nanimosity against Popery and Prelacy. What does he mean? Is it a case of\r\nconversion? Is it an outpouring merely, by a strange vent, of certain\r\nacrid humours? Is he honest, and in earnest? or is he making sport of\r\nthose hapless Englishmen whom he pronounces \"in human stupidity to have\r\nno fellow?\"\r\n\r\nObservers of a curious and speculative turn might, perhaps, explain it\r\nthus:--Mr Carlyle is evidently a writer of strong religious feelings.\r\nMarry, when he would exhibit them to the world, he is under the\r\nnecessity of borrowing a creed from some one else. His own philosophy\r\nhas nothing palpable enough for ordinary vision; nothing, as we\r\nremember, but vague infinities and eternities, with an \"everlasting\r\n_yes_,\" and an \"everlasting _no_.\" As the choice lay quite open to him,\r\nthere was no reason why he should not select the very hottest creed he\r\ncould any where find lying about in our history. From contemporaries it\r\nwas not likely that he should borrow: he loves nothing, praises nothing,\r\nesteems nothing of this poor visible present; but it was an additional\r\nrecommendation to the Puritanic piety, that it had left a detestable\r\nmemory behind it, and was in declared hostility with all contemporaneous\r\nways of thinking. What could he better do, therefore, than borrow this\r\nold volcanic crater of Puritanism, and pour out from it his religion and\r\nhis anger upon a graceless world?\r\n\r\nOthers, not given to such refinements, would explain the phenomenon upon\r\nmore ordinary principles, and reduce the enigma to a case merely of\r\nliterary monomania. Mr Carlyle, they would say, has been striving to\r\nunderstand these Puritans till he has grown, for the time, to resemble\r\nthem. In the effort to project his mind into their mind, he has overshot\r\nthe mark; he has not been able yet to get his own mind back again. It is\r\na case, they would say, of mere imagination. Could you bring Mr Carlyle\r\ninto contact with a live Puritan, the charm would be instantly\r\ndispelled. If one of Harrison's troopers would but ask him to step aside\r\nwith him, under a hedge, to wrestle for a blessing, or would kindly\r\nundertake to catechise him on some point of divinity,--on that notion of\r\nhis, for instance, of \"Right and Wrong bodying themselves into Hell and\r\nHeaven,\"--the alliance would be dissolved, not, perhaps, without violent\r\nrupture.\r\n\r\nFor ourselves, we sometimes think that Mr Carlyle is in earnest. Men\r\nshould be honest. One who talks so loudly about _faith_, ought to be\r\nsincere in his utterances to the public. At other times, the mummery\r\nbecomes too violent, grows too \"fast and furious,\" to permit us to\r\nbelieve that what we witness is the sane carriage of a sane man. At all\r\nevents, we can but look on with calm surprise. If our philosopher will\r\ntuck his robe high up about his loins, and play the merry-andrew, if he\r\nwill grimace, and paint thick, and hold dialogue with himself, who shall\r\nhinder him?--only we would rather not wear, on such an occasion, the\r\ndocile aspect of admiring pupils; we prefer to stand aside, and look on\r\nwith Mr Dryasdust.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note, that however Mr Carlyle extols his \"Heroic Ones\"\r\nin a body, Cromwell is the only individual that finds a good word\r\nthroughout the work. Every one else, Hampden not excepted, is spoken of\r\nwith slight and disparagement. Amongst all the \"godlike,\" there is but\r\none who finds favour in his sight,--him, however, he never deserts,--and\r\nthe very parties who have before been applauded, in general terms,\r\nbecome the subjects of ridicule or castigation the moment they are seen\r\nin opposition to Cromwell.\r\n\r\nTo Cromwell, then, let us turn our attention. Him we also can admire. We\r\nadmire his great practical sagacity, his eminent talents for war and for\r\ngovernment, the moderation and the conscientiousness which, though a\r\nusurper and a zealot, he displayed in the use of power. He was, as we\r\nhave said, a genuine Puritan. This must be understood, or no\r\nintelligible view of his character can be taken. It is not only\r\nhostility to his memory which has attributed to him a studied hypocrisy;\r\nthe love of the marvellous has lent its aid. Such a supposition was\r\nthought to magnify his talents and his genius. It was more dramatic to\r\nmake him the \"honest Iago\" of the piece. A French writer, M. Villemain,\r\nin his History of Cromwell, expresses this feeling very naively, and\r\nspeaks of an hypocrisy \"que l'histoire atteste, et qu'on ne saurait\r\nmettre en doute sans oter quelque chose a l'idee de son genie; car les\r\nhommes verront toujours moins de grandeur dans un fanatique de bonne\r\nfoi, que dans une ambition qui fait des enthusiastes. Cromwell mena les\r\nhommes par la prise qu'ils lui donnaient sur eux. _L'ambition seule lui\r\ninspira des crimes, qu'il fit executer par le fanatisme des autres._\"\r\nThat he thus employed the spirit of the age without sharing it, is a\r\ntheory which will not stand the light for a moment. Besides, it is not\r\nin this manner that history is transacted: we may all be puppets, if you\r\nwill, upon the scene, but it is not in this fashion that any one man\r\ngets hold of the wires. The supposition, whatever honour it may do the\r\ngenius of Cromwell, will do very little honour to the speculative genius\r\nof any writer who adopts it. But this is evident, that to whatever\r\nextent Cromwell shared the distempered feelings of a sectarian party,\r\nnothing ever clouded his penetration upon any affair of conduct, any\r\nquestion of means to an end. The hour never came that found him wanting.\r\nAt every phase of the revolution he is there to lead, or control, or\r\npredominate over it.\r\n\r\nStarting from this point of view--understanding him, in the first place,\r\nas the conscientious zealous Puritan, and endeavouring to estimate, as\r\nthe history proceeds, the modifications which the soldier and the\r\ngeneral, and finally the Protector, would induce upon this original\r\nsubstratum--the character of Cromwell becomes intelligible, and his\r\nconduct, in a measure, consistent. Whilst yet a private man, he had\r\nwarmly espoused the extreme opinions of that religious party who looked\r\non Popery as antichrist, and the Church of England as little better than\r\nPopery in disguise, as the same scarlet lady in a somewhat more modest\r\nattire. He was one of a class occasionally met with in the most quiet\r\nwalks of life, men who torment their spirit on some public question till\r\nit becomes a personal grievance, or rather a corroding passion. What\r\nwere bishops personally to him? He might have prayed, and expounded, and\r\nwalked meditative in his fields, and left a public question to be\r\ndecided by the movements, necessarily slow, of public opinion. But no;\r\nhe was constituted quite otherwise. From a spiritual jurisdiction,\r\nclaimed though not exercised over him, his soul revolted. And this\r\nhatred to prelacy, to any spiritual authority over him or his--this\r\ndetermination to be his own priest--is, if not the strongest, certainly\r\nthe steadiest and most constant feeling that he manifests. We trace it\r\nthroughout his whole career. The first thing we hear of him in the House\r\nof Commons is a protest, a sort of ominous growl, against the promotion\r\nof some Arminian or semi-Popish divine. \"If these are the steps to\r\nchurch preferment, what are we to expect!\" Almost the first glimpse we\r\ncatch of him when he has taken arms, is as the captain of a troop\r\nentering some cathedral church, and bidding the surpliced priest, who\r\nwas reading the liturgy, \"to cease his fooling, and come down!\" And\r\nthroughout the letters which he addresses to the Speaker from the seat\r\nof war, he rarely omits the opportunity of hinting, that the soldiers\r\nare worthy of that religious liberty for which they have fought so well.\r\n\"We pray you, own His people more and more; for they are the chariots\r\nand horsemen of Israel.\" And in one of his latest speeches, he describes\r\nit as the great \"extremity\" of past times, that men were not permitted\r\nto preach in public unless they were ordained.\r\n\r\nA rooted animosity to prelatical or other spiritual domination, is the\r\nkey-note of this \"melodious worker,\" as Mr Carlyle calls him. Cromwell\r\nentered the civil war provided with no theory or plan of civil\r\ngovernment, animated with no republican zeal; it was not patriotism in\r\nany ordinary sense of the word, it was his controversy with the church\r\nof England that brought him on the field of battle. After fighting\r\nagainst episcopacy, he fought with equal zeal against presbyterianism;\r\nbut against monarchy, or for the republic, he can hardly be said to have\r\ndrawn the sword. We all applaud the sagacity which saw at once that the\r\nstrongest antagonist to the honour and fidelity of the royalist, was to\r\nbe found in the passion of the zealot. He enlisted his praying regiment.\r\nFrom that time the battle was won. But the cause was lost. What hope\r\ncould there be for the cause of civil freedom, of constitutional rights,\r\nwhen the champion who won its victories was fanatical zeal, and the rage\r\nof theological controversy?\r\n\r\nIt is the glaring defect in Cromwell--a defect which he had in common\r\nwith many others of his time--that he threw himself into a revolution\r\nhaving for its first object to remodel the civil government, animated\r\nonly with the passions of the collateral controversy upon ecclesiastical\r\ngovernment. He fought the battle which was to destroy the monarchy,\r\nwithout any fixed idea or desire for the republican government which\r\nmust be its substitute. This was not the subject that had engaged his\r\nthoughts or inflamed his ardour. When, therefore, the royalists had been\r\nconquered, it is not at all surprising that he should have seen nothing\r\nbut the difficulties in the way of forming a republic. At this point of\r\nhis history some excuse for him may be drawn from the very defect we are\r\nnoticing. His mind had dwelt on no theory of civil government--to the\r\ncause of the commonwealth his heart had never been pledged--and we can\r\nhardly call him, with justice, as Godwin does, a traitor to the\r\nrepublic. But, on the other hand, what a gap, what a void, does this\r\ndisclose in the mind of our hero? What should we say of one who had\r\nplunged heart and soul into the French Revolution, conducted only by his\r\nrage against the Roman Catholic hierarchy? Such a one, had he risen to\r\ntake a leading part in that drama, might have acted with greater wisdom\r\nand moderation than ardent and patriotic men; the very absence of any\r\npolitical opinion or passion might have enabled him to see more clearly\r\nthan others the position which they all occupied; but this would not\r\njustify or palliate the original error, the rash, exclusive,\r\nself-blinding zeal which had brought him into that position.\r\n\r\nTo the ecclesiastical controversy, Cromwell clings throughout with an\r\nutter recklessness of the fate of civil government. When episcopacy had\r\nbeen vanquished, and presbyterianism threatened to take its place, he\r\nwas quite as willing to plunge the whole kingdom into confusion and\r\nanarchy in his opposition to this new enemy, as to the old. Those who\r\nwould defend him from the charge of personal ambition--all who excuse\r\nhis conduct at this period of the history, put this plea upon\r\nrecord,--and without a doubt his hostility to presbyterianism was a very\r\ngreat and leading motive with him in his opposition to the Parliament,\r\nand his determination to prevent a reconciliation between the House and\r\nthe King. When Charles was a prisoner at the Isle of Wight, it is well\r\nknown that the Parliament were anxious to come to some terms of\r\nreconcilement, and the concessions which he then made were voted to be\r\n\"a sufficient ground for the future settlement of the kingdom.\" Why did\r\nCromwell interfere at this juncture between the two parties, in such a\r\nway as entirely to destroy both? His best public ground is his hostility\r\nto presbyterianism. And what was the presbytery, that to him it should\r\nbe so distasteful, and an object of so great animosity? Its forms of\r\nworship, the doctrines preached by its divines, were exactly those he\r\nhimself practised and approved. There were no altars here, no surplices,\r\nno traditions, no sympathies with Rome, no stealthy approximations to\r\nher detested idolatries. But there was a claim put forward to\r\necclesiastical supremacy, to ordain, and authorise, and control public\r\npreachers, which he could not tolerate; and if no other motive had\r\nexisted, he was ready to oppose every settlement, at every risk, having\r\nfor its object to establish a claim of this description.\r\n\r\nWe will open the Letters and Speeches of Cromwell at this period of the\r\nhistory, and present our readers with a specimen of his epistolary\r\nstyle, and one which will go far to show how little his mind was\r\ninfluenced, even at this great crisis, by any thing which we should\r\ndescribe as political reasoning. Cromwell was a great _administrator_,\r\nbut he had no vocation for speculative politics, and little attachment\r\nto forms of government. Framers of constitutions are not in repute at\r\npresent; they have not covered themselves with applause, rather with\r\nconfusion; and this defect in Cromwell's mind will probably be looked\r\nupon with great indulgence. Nevertheless, people who go to war to\r\ndemolish an existing government, ought to have taken thought for a\r\nsubstitute; on _them_ it is incumbent to have a political creed, and a\r\nconstitution to set up. At this very moment when the question is no\r\nless, than whether the king should be put to death, and monarchy rooted\r\nout of the land--ay, and the Parliament coerced, in order to effect\r\nthese objects--our Puritan general reasons--like a Puritan and nothing\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was addressed to Colonel Hammond, then governor of\r\nthe Isle of Wight. The colonel had been distressed by his scruples at\r\nthe extreme course the army was disposed to take, and had solicited this\r\nappointment to the Isle of Wight as a retreat from the scene of faction\r\nand violence. But it was precisely in this quiet little island that the\r\nking took refuge; his perplexities, therefore, were increased and not\r\ndiminished. Cromwell writes to him to remove his scruples, and makes a\r\ncharacteristic allusion to this circumstance--_improves_ it, as we\r\nshould say.\r\n\r\nWe must apprise the reader, however, that it would be dangerous to form\r\nany opinion upon the religious sincerity or insincerity of Cromwell,\r\nupon extracts from his letters and speeches, or even upon any single\r\nletter or speech. From the incongruity we feel between the solemnity of\r\nthe subject of religion, and the manner and occasion in which it is\r\nintroduced, and from the use of certain expressions long since\r\nconsecrated to ridicule, it is impossible for a modern reader, on\r\nfalling upon some isolated passages, not to exclaim, that this is cant\r\nand hypocrisy! But when the whole series, or the greater part of it, is\r\nread--when the same strain of thought and feeling, in season and out of\r\nseason, is constantly observed--it is equally impossible not to feel\r\npersuaded that these letters and speeches body forth the genuine\r\ncharacter of the man, and that the writer was verily a solemn and most\r\nserious person, in whom religious zeal was the last quality which needed\r\nreinforcement.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR ROBIN,--No man rejoiceth more to see a line from thee\r\n     than myself. I know thou hast long been under trial. Thou shalt\r\n     be no loser by it. All things must work for the best.\r\n\r\n     \"Thou desirest to hear of my experiences. I can tell thee, I am\r\n     such a one as thou did formerly know, having a body of sin and\r\n     death; but I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord, there is\r\n     no condemnation though much infirmity; and I wait for the\r\n     redemption. And in this poor condition I obtain mercy, and\r\n     sweet consolation through the Spirit. And find abundant cause\r\n     every day to exalt the Lord and abase flesh--and herein I have\r\n     some exercise.\r\n\r\n     \"As to outward dispensations, if we may so call them, we have\r\n     not been without our share of beholding some remarkable\r\n     providences and appearances of the Lord. His presence hath been\r\n     amongst us, and by the light of his countenance we have\r\n     prevailed (_alludes to the battle of Preston_.) We are sure the\r\n     goodness of Him who dwelt in the bush has shined upon us; and\r\n     we can humbly say, we know in whom we have believed; who can\r\n     and will perfect what remaineth, and us also in doing what is\r\n     well-pleasing in His eye-sight.\r\n\r\n     \"I find some trouble in your spirit, occasioned first not only\r\n     by your sad and heavy burden, as you call it, but also by the\r\n     dissatisfaction you take at the ways of some good men whom you\r\n     love with your heart, who through the principle, that it is\r\n     lawful for a lesser part, if in the right, to force a numerical\r\n     majority, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n     \"To the first: call not your burden sad or heavy. If your\r\n     Father laid it on you, He intended neither. He is the Father of\r\n     light, from whom comes every good and perfect gift; who of His\r\n     own will begot us.... Dear Robin, our fleshly reasonings\r\n     ensnare us. These make us say 'heavy,' 'sad,' 'pleasant,'\r\n     'easy.' Was there not a little of this when Robert Hammond,\r\n     through dissatisfaction too, desired retirement from the army,\r\n     and thought of quiet in the Isle of Wight? Did not God find him\r\n     out there? I believe he will never forget this. And now I\r\n     perceive he is to seek again; partly through his sad and heavy\r\n     burden, and partly through his dissatisfaction with friends'\r\n     actings.\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Robin, thou and I were never worthy to be door-keepers in\r\n     this service. If thou wilt seek, seek to know the mind of God\r\n     in all that chain of providence, whereby God brought thee\r\n     thither, and that person (_the king_) to thee; how, before and\r\n     since, God hath ordered him, and affairs concerning him; and\r\n     then tell me, whether there be not some glorious and high\r\n     meaning in all this, above what thou hast yet attained? And,\r\n     laying aside thy fleshly reason, seek of the Lord to teach thee\r\n     what that is; and He will do it. I dare be positive to say, It\r\n     is not that the wicked should be exalted that God should so\r\n     appear as indeed He hath done. For there is no peace to _them_.\r\n     No; it is set upon the hearts of such as fear the Lord, and we\r\n     have witness upon witness, that it shall go ill with them and\r\n     their partakers.\r\n\r\n     \"As to thy dissatisfaction with friends' actings upon that\r\n     supposed principle--I wonder not at that. If a man take not his\r\n     own burden well, he shall hardly others'; especially if\r\n     involved by so near a relation of love and Christian\r\n     brotherhood as thou art, I shall not take upon me to satisfy;\r\n     but I hold myself bound to lay my thoughts before so dear a\r\n     friend. The Lord do His own will.\r\n\r\n     \"You say, 'God hath appointed authorities among the nations, to\r\n     which active or passive obedience is to be yielded. This\r\n     resides, in England, in the Parliament. Therefore, active or\r\n     passive resistance,' &c. &c.\r\n\r\n     \"Authorities and powers are the ordinance of God. This or that\r\n     species is of human institution, and limited some with larger,\r\n     others with stricter bands, each one according to its\r\n     constitution. But I do not therefore think that the authorities\r\n     may do _any thing_, and yet such obedience be due. All agree\r\n     that there are cases in which it is lawful to resist. If so,\r\n     your ground fails, and so likewise the inference. Indeed, dear\r\n     Robin, not to multiply words, the query is,--Whether ours be\r\n     such case? This, ingenuously, is the true question.\r\n\r\n     \"To this I shall say nothing, though I could say very much; but\r\n     only desire thee to see what thou findest in thy own heart to\r\n     two or three plain considerations. _First_, Whether _Salus\r\n     populi_ be a sound position? _Secondly_, Whether, in the way in\r\n     hand (_the parliamentary treaty with the king_,) really and\r\n     before the Lord, before whom conscience has to stand, this be\r\n     provided for--or if the whole fruit of the war is not likely to\r\n     be frustrated, and all most like to turn to what it was, and\r\n     worse? And this contrary to engagements, explicit covenants\r\n     with those who ventured their lives upon those covenants and\r\n     engagements, without whom, perhaps in equity, relaxation ought\r\n     not to be? _Thirdly_, Whether this army be not a lawful power,\r\n     called by God to oppose and fight against the king upon some\r\n     stated grounds; and being in power to such ends, may not oppose\r\n     one name of authority, for those ends, as well as another\r\n     name--since it was not the outward authority summoning them\r\n     that by its power made the quarrel lawful, but the quarrel was\r\n     lawful in itself? If so, it may be, acting will be justified\r\n     _in foro humano_. _But truly this kind of reasoning may be but\r\n     fleshly, either with or against: only it is good to try what\r\n     truth may be in them. And the Lord teach us._\r\n\r\n     \"My dear friend, let us look into providences; surely they mean\r\n     somewhat. They hang so together; have been so constant, so\r\n     clear, unclouded. Malice, swoln malice against God's people,\r\n     now called 'saints,' to root out their name;--and yet they\r\n     these poor saints getting arms and therein blessed with defence\r\n     and more! I desire he that is for a principle of suffering\r\n     (_passive obedience_) would not too much slight this. I slight\r\n     not him who is so minded; but let us beware lest fleshly\r\n     reasoning see more safety in making use of this principle than\r\n     in acting! Who acts, if he resolve not through God to be\r\n     willing to part with all? Our hearts are very deceitful, on the\r\n     right and on the left.\r\n\r\n     \"What think you of providence disposing the hearts of so many\r\n     of God's people this way--especially in this poor army, wherein\r\n     the great God has vouchsafed to appear! I know not one officer\r\n     but is on the increasing side (_come over to this opinion_.) ...\r\n\r\n     \"Thou mentionest somewhat as if by acting against such\r\n     opposition as is like to be, there will be a tempting of God.\r\n     Dear Robin, tempting of God ordinarily is either by acting\r\n     presumptuously in carnal confidence, or in unbelief through\r\n     diffidence: both these ways Israel tempted God in the\r\n     wilderness, and He was grieved by them. Not the encountering of\r\n     difficulties, therefore, makes us to tempt God; but the acting\r\n     before and without faith. If the Lord have in any measure\r\n     persuaded His people, as generally He hath, of the lawfulness,\r\n     nay of the _duty_,--this persuasion prevailing upon the heart\r\n     is faith; and acting thereupon is acting in faith; and the more\r\n     the difficulties are the more the faith. And it is most sweet\r\n     that he who is not persuaded have patience towards them that\r\n     are, and judge not; and this will free thee from the trouble of\r\n     others' actings, which thou sayest adds to thy grief....\r\n\r\n     \"Robin, I have done. Ask we our hearts whether we think that\r\n     after all these dispensations, the like to which many\r\n     generations cannot afford, should end in so corrupt reasonings\r\n     of good men, and should so hit the designings of bad? Thinkest\r\n     thou in thy heart that the glorious dispensations of God point\r\n     out to this? Or to teach his people to trust in Him and wait\r\n     for better things--when, it may be, better are sealed to many\r\n     of their spirits (_indubitably sure to many of them_.)\r\n\r\n     \"This trouble I have been at because my soul loves thee, and I\r\n     would not have thee swerve or lose any glorious opportunity the\r\n     Lord puts into thy hand. The Lord be thy counsellor. Dear\r\n     Robin, I rest thine,\r\n\r\n     \"OLIVER CROMWELL.\"\r\n\r\nFor ourselves, we cannot read this, and other letters breathing the same\r\nspirit, without being convinced that Cromwell fully shared in those\r\nfanatical sentiments which prompted the army to insist upon the king's\r\ndeath. A contemporary account, from which Mr Carlyle, some pages before\r\nthis letter occurs, has quoted largely, represents this chief of the\r\nPuritans in exactly the same point of view. The officers of the army had\r\nmade certain overtures to the king, certain efforts at a reconciliation,\r\nwhich had been fruitless; and which had been, moreover, attended with\r\nmuch division and contention amongst themselves. They had turned aside,\r\nit seems, from \"that path of _simplicity_ they had been blessed in, to\r\nwalk in a _politic_ path,\" and were, accordingly, afflicted, \"as the\r\nwages of their backsliding hearts,\" with tumults, and jealousies, and\r\ndivisions. But the godly officers, says the pious record of Adjutant\r\nAllen, met at _Windsor Castle_! \"and there we spent one day together in\r\nprayer; inquiring into the causes of that sad dispensation. And, on the\r\nmorrow, we met again in the morning; where many spake from the Word and\r\nprayed; and the then Lieutenant-General Cromwell did press very\r\nearnestly on all there present, to a thorough consideration of our\r\nactions as an army, and of our ways particularly as private Christians;\r\nto see if any iniquity could be found in them; and what it was; that, if\r\npossible, he might find it out, and so remove the cause of such sad\r\nrebukes as were upon us, (by reason of our iniquities, as we judged,) at\r\nthat time. And the way, more particularly, the Lord led us to herein was\r\nthis: to look back and consider what time it was when, with joint\r\nsatisfaction, we could last say, to the best of our judgments, The\r\npresence of the Lord was amongst us, and rebukes and judgments were not,\r\nas then, upon us.... By which means we were, by a gracious hand of the\r\nLord, led to find out the very steps, (as were all there jointly\r\nconvinced,) by which we had departed from the Lord, and provoked Him to\r\ndepart from us, which we found to be those cursed carnal conferences,\r\nour own conceited wisdom, our fears, and want of faith, had prompted us,\r\nthe year before, to entertain with the king and his party. And at this\r\ntime, and on this occasion, did the then Major Goffe, (as I remember was\r\nhis title,) make use of that good word, Proverbs 1st and 23d, _Turn you\r\nat my reproof; behold I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make\r\nknown my words unto you._\" In fine, their \"iniquities,\" their want of\r\nfaith, their carnal conferences--that is to say, all desire for peace,\r\nall humanity, all moderation, all care for their country--were cast\r\naside, and they came to the solitary gloomy resolution, \"That it is our\r\nduty to call Charles Stuart, that man of blood, to an account for that\r\nblood he had shed, and mischief he had done to his utmost, against the\r\nLord's cause and people in these poor nations.\"\r\n\r\nLet no one suppose that, because Cromwell, and other officers of the\r\narmy, had been negotiating with the king, bidding for him, in fact,\r\nagainst the Parliament, and offering terms such as it was mere\r\ninfatuation upon his part not to accept, that they were, therefore, not\r\nsincere in this their fanaticism, which now so clearly told them they\r\nshould be doing the express will of God in putting him to death. Those\r\nwho have paid attention to this disease of the mind, know well, that\r\nwhile nothing is more violent at one moment, nothing is more flexible at\r\nanother. Against the assaults of reason it is rock,--it is adamant; but\r\nto self-interest, or a covert passion, it is often surprisingly ductile.\r\nThe genuine fanatic is gifted with a power which will equally uphold\r\nhim, whether he walks to the right or to the left, and lets him change\r\nhis course as often as he will. He has a logic that is always\r\ntriumphant--which proves him always in the right--whether he would\r\nadvance or recede. Success--it is God's own sanction; failure--it is\r\nwhat you please,--God's disapproval if you would retreat--a trial only\r\nof your faith, if you have the heart to advance. In the present case,\r\nour pious army, having found it impossible to treat with the king, has\r\nbut to spend \"its day in prayer,\" and its fierce zeal resumes its former\r\nchannel with greater violence than ever. It has been led astray, it\r\nfinds, by carnal reasonings and sinful weakness; and, rushing back to\r\nits old \"path of simplicity,\" it raises the cry of death!\r\n\r\nThis account, which Adjutent Allan gives of diseased piety and perilous\r\nfanaticism, Mr Carlyle accompanies with interjections of applause, and\r\ncheers of encouragement. To him, also, it seems quite fit that the army\r\nshould return to its path of \"simplicity.\" The King must die.\r\n\r\nHow little, up to the very last, did that unfortunate monarch know of\r\nthe terrible spirit of those enemies into whose hands he had fallen! He\r\nsaw himself necessary to the tranquillisation and stable government of a\r\nnation still imbued with the love of monarchy, he therefore thought\r\nhimself and the monarchy were safe; he knew not that he was contending\r\nwith men who, when they rose to their high \"heroic\" mood, had a supreme\r\ncontempt for all considerations touching mere human polity,--the mere\r\npeace and government of mankind. He trusted much to the sacredness of\r\nroyalty, the majesty of the purple, the divinity of a King; he was\r\ndelivered over to the power of enemies, whose glory it was to tread down\r\nthe glories of the world; who, so far from finding any sacredness in his\r\nroyalty, had classed him amongst all the wicked kings of the Old\r\nTestament, sentenced to be exterminated with the idolatry they fostered,\r\nand with whom the very audacity and fearful temerity of the deed, (if\r\nthis at all affected them,) would add only to its merit. Unfortunate\r\nmonarch! The tide of sympathy runs now against him, but we confess still\r\nto retain our compassion for the fallen prince,--our compassion, very\r\nlittle, it may be, of admiration. We see him contending against fearful\r\nodds, keeping up a high and kingly spirit to the last. So far he braved\r\nit nobly, and played a desperate game, if not wisely, yet with unshaken\r\nnerves. His character, without a doubt, bears, as Lingard writes, \"the\r\ntaint of duplicity.\" But it was a duplicity which, in his father's\r\ncourt, would have been chuckled over as good practice of state-craft. We\r\nare strangely fashioned--kings, and all of us--made up of fragments of\r\nvirtue, ill-assorted parcels of morality. Charles, when he had given his\r\nparole of honour, would not escape from his imprisonment in the Isle of\r\nWight, though the means of escape were offered to him. But the wily and\r\ndiplomatic monarch thought he was entitling himself to the praise of all\r\nmen of spirit and intelligence, when, by fallacious promises and\r\nprotestations, he strove to play off one party of his enemies against\r\nthe other. He was practising, to the best of his ability, all the\r\ntraditionary maxims and manoeuvres of a subtle policy. Nor was it\r\nability that he wanted. On an Italian soil, these Italian arts might\r\nhave availed him. But what were the sleights and contrivances of a\r\ntraditionary state-craft against the rude storm of tumultuous passions\r\nwhich had been conjured up around him! He was fencing with the\r\nwhirlwind. Perhaps no prince, trained in a court, can be a match for the\r\nrude adversaries which revolutionary times raise up against him. What\r\nchance is there that he should ever learn the nature of his new and\r\nterrible enemy? You have taught him, according to all the laws of\r\nwoodcraft, to chase the stag and the fox, and now you let loose upon him\r\nthe wild beast of the forest! How was Charles to learn what manner of\r\nbeing was a Puritan, and how it struck its prey? His courtiers would\r\nhave taught him to despise and ridicule--his bishops to look askance\r\nwith solemn aversion,--but who was there to teach him to fear this\r\nPuritan?--to teach him that he must forthwith conciliate, if he could\r\nnot crush?\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to continue the narrative a little further. We adopt\r\nMr Carlyle's words. \"At London, matters are coming rapidly to a crisis.\r\nThe resumed debate, 'shall the army remonstrance be taken into\r\nconsideration?' does not come out affirmative; on the contrary, on\r\nThursday the 31st, it comes out negative, by a majority of ninety. 'No,\r\nwe will not take it into consideration.' 'No?' The army at Windsor\r\nthereupon spends again 'a day in prayer.' The army at Windsor has\r\ndecided on the morrow, that it will march to London; marches, arrives\r\naccordingly, on Saturday, December 2d; quarters itself in Whitehall, in\r\nSt James's, 'and other great vacant houses in the skirts of the city and\r\nvillages about, no offence being given any where.' In the drama of\r\nmodern history, one knows not any graver, more note-worthy scene;\r\nearnest as very death and judgment. They have decided to have justice,\r\nthese men; to see God's justice done, and his judgments executed on this\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nAdjutant Allen and Mr Carlyle are both of the same mind,--take the same\r\nviews of public matters, political and religious. But the Adjutant\r\nhimself would open great eyes at the sentence which next follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The abysses where the thunders and splendours are bred--the reader sees\r\nthem again laid bare and black. Madness lying close to the wisdom which\r\nis brightest and highest;--and owls and godless men who hate the\r\nlightning and the light, and love the mephitic dusk and darkness, are no\r\njudges of the actions of heroes! Shedders of blood? Yes, blood is\r\noccasionally shed. The healing surgeon, the sacrificial priest, the\r\naugust judge, pronouncer of God's oracles to man, these and the\r\natrocious murderer are alike shedders of blood; and it is an owl's eye,\r\nthat, except for the _dresses_ they wear, discerns no difference in\r\nthese! Let us leave the owl to his hootings; let us get on with our\r\nchronology and swift course of events.\"\r\n\r\nBy forcibly expelling more than one hundred of the members of\r\nParliament, and thus converting a minority into a majority, these\r\n\"sacrificial priests\" contrived to accomplish their very righteous act.\r\nIn the face of raving such as this, it would be absurd to enter\r\nseriously upon any consideration, moral or political, touching the\r\nKing's death. We would rather that Mr Carlyle occupied the field alone.\r\nWe saw him just now dealing with his \"abysses,\" and his \"lightning;\" we\r\nquote his concluding comment on this event, which will present a\r\nspecimen of his more facetious style of eloquence, and the singular\r\n_taste_ he is capable of displaying:--\r\n\r\n\"This action of the English regicides did in effect strike a damp like\r\ndeath through the heart of _flunkeyism_ universally in this world.\r\nWhereof flunkeyism, cant, cloth-worship, or whatever ugly name it have,\r\nhas gone about incurably sick ever since; and is now at length, in these\r\ngenerations, very rapidly dying. The like of which action will not be\r\nneeded for a thousand years again. Needed, alas! not till a new genuine\r\nhero-worship has arisen, has perfected itself; and had time to\r\ndegenerate into a flunkeyism and cloth-worship again! which I take to be\r\na very long date indeed.\r\n\r\n\"Thus ends the second civil war: in regicide, in a Commonwealth, and\r\nkeepers of the liberties of England: In punishment of delinquents, in\r\nabolition of cobwebs;--if it be possible, in a government of Heroism\r\nand veracity; at lowest of anti-flunkeyism, anti-cant, and the\r\n_endeavour_ after heroism and veracity.\"\r\n\r\nFlunkeyism! Such is the title which our _many-sided_ man thinks fit to\r\nbestow on the loyalty of England! But serious indignation would be out\r\nof place. A buffoon expression has this advantage, it is unanswerable.\r\nYet will we venture to say, that it is a losing game this which you are\r\nplaying, Mr Carlyle, this defiance of all common sense and all good\r\ntaste. There is a respectability other than that which, in the\r\nunwearying love of one poor jest, you delight to call \"gig\r\nrespectability,\" a respectability based on intelligence and not on\r\n\"Long-Acre springs,\" whose disesteem it cannot be wise to provoke, nor\r\nvery pleasant to endure.\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth is proclaimed by sound of trumpet. The king and the\r\nlords are cashiered and dismissed. A house of representatives and a\r\ncouncil of state form the constitution of England. Cromwell is one of\r\nthe council. But for the present the war in Ireland carries him away\r\nfrom the scene of politics.\r\n\r\nOn this Irish campaign, Mr Carlyle breaks out, as may be supposed, in a\r\nstrain of exultation. He always warms at blood and battle. His piety, or\r\nhis poetry--not admirable whichever it may be--glows here to a red heat.\r\nWe are as little disposed perhaps as himself, to stand \"shrieking out\"\r\nover the military severities of this campaign, but if we could bring\r\nourselves to believe that Mr Carlyle is really serious in what he\r\nwrites, we should say that the most impracticable maudlin of peace\r\nsocieties, or \"Rousseau-sentimentalism,\" were wisdom itself compared to\r\nhis own outrageous and fanatical strain. If the apologist of Cromwell\r\nwill be content to rest his case on the plain ground open to all\r\ngenerals and captains on whom has devolved the task of subjecting a\r\nrebellious and insurrectionary country--on the plain ground that the\r\nobject is to be more speedily effected, and with less bloodshed and\r\nmisery to the inhabitants, by carrying on the war at the commencement\r\nwith the utmost severity, (thus breaking down at once the spirit of\r\ninsurrection,) than by prolonging the contest through an exercise of\r\nleniency and forbearance--we are not aware that any decisive answer can\r\nbe given to him. It is an awful piece of surgery to contemplate--one may\r\nbe excused, if one shudders both at it and the operator--but,\r\nnevertheless, it may have been the wisest course to pursue. As a general\r\nrule, every one will admit that--if war there must be--it is better that\r\nit should be short and violent, than long and indecisive; for there is\r\nnothing so mischievous, so destructive of the industry and moral\r\ncharacter of a people, as a war which, so to speak, _domesticates_\r\nitself amongst them. Put aside \"the saint\" entirely,--let us see only\r\nthe soldier,--and Cromwell's campaign in Ireland may present nothing\r\nmore terrible than what elsewhere, and in the campaigns of other\r\ngenerals, we are accustomed to regard as the necessary evils of war;\r\nnothing more than what a Turenne, a Conde, or a Frederic of Prussia,\r\nmight have applauded or practised. But this is precisely the last thing\r\nour editor would be disposed to do; any so common-place, and commonsense\r\nview of the matter, would have been utterly distasteful: he _does_ bring\r\nthe saint very prominently upon the field, and we are to recognise in\r\nCromwell--\"an armed soldier, terrible as Death, relentless as Doom;\r\n_doing God's judgments on the enemies of God!_\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a phenomenon,\" he continues, \"not of joyful nature; no, but of\r\nawful, to be looked at with pious terror and awe. Not a phenomenon which\r\nyou are taught to recognise with bright smiles, and fall in love with at\r\nsight:--thou, art thou worthy to love such a thing; worthy to do other\r\nthan hate it, and shriek over it? Darest thou wed the Heaven's\r\nlightning, then; and say to it, Godlike One? Is thy own life beautiful\r\nand terrible to thee; steeped in the eternal depths, in the eternal\r\nplendours?\"--(Vol. ii. p. 53.)\r\n\r\nIn the despatch which Cromwell addresses to the Speaker, Lenthall, after\r\nthe storm of Tredah, otherwise Drogheda, we observe that the Puritan is\r\nas strong as ever, but that the Soldier and the great Captain speak out\r\nwith increased boldness. Our sectarian farmer of St Ives, who brooded,\r\nby the dark waters of the Ouse, over the wickedness of surpliced\r\nprelacy, whose unemployed spirit sank at times into hypochondria, and\r\nwas afflicted with \"strange fancies about the town-cross,\" has been\r\nmoving for some time in the very busiest scene the world could furnish\r\nhim, and has become the great general of his age. The spirit of the \"big\r\nwars\" has entered, and grown up side by side with his Puritanism. The\r\nardour of the battle fully possesses him; he is the conqueror always in\r\nthe tremendous charge he makes at the head of his Ironsides; and he lets\r\nappear, notwithstanding his self-denying style, a consciousness and a\r\ntriumph in his own skill as a tactician. He is still the genuine\r\nPuritan; but the arduous life, the administrative duties of a soldier\r\nand a general, have also been busy in modifying his character, and\r\ncalling forth and exercising that self-confidence, which he will by and\r\nby recognise as \"faith\" and the leading of Providence, when he assumes\r\nthe place of dictator of his country.\r\n\r\nFrom one passage in this despatch it would appear that his severity at\r\nthe storm of Drogheda was not wholly the result of predetermined policy,\r\nbut rose, in part, from the natural passion which the sword, and the\r\ndesperate struggle for life, call forth.\r\n\r\n\"Divers of the enemy retreated into the Mill-Mount, a place very strong\r\nand of difficult access. The Governor, Sir Arthur Ashton, and divers\r\nconsiderable officers being there, our men getting up to them, were\r\nordered by me to put them all to the sword. _And, indeed, being in the\r\nheat of action_, I forbade them to spare any that were in arms in the\r\ntown; and, I think, that night they put to the sword about 2000 men:\r\ndivers of the officers and soldiers being fled over the bridge into the\r\nother part of the town, where about 100 of them possessed St Peter's\r\nchurch steeple, some the west gate, and others a strong round tower next\r\nthe gate called St Sunday's. These being summoned to yield to mercy,\r\nrefused; whereupon I ordered the steeple of St Peter's church to be\r\nfired, when one of them was heard to say in the midst of the flames,\r\n'God damn me, God confound me! I burn, I burn.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the same despatch there is rather a noticeable passage, which\r\nillustrates the manner in which the Puritan general was accustomed to\r\nregard the Roman Catholics and their worship. There may be some who have\r\nbeen so far deceived by the frequent use of the terms \"religious\r\ntoleration\" in conjunction with the name of Cromwell, as to attribute to\r\nhim a portion of that liberal spirit which is the greatest boast of\r\ncultivated minds in the present century. His religious toleration\r\nextended only to the small circle of sects whose Christian doctrine,\r\nwhose preaching, and whose forms of worship were almost identical; it\r\nwas just the same toleration that a Baptist dissenter of our day may be\r\nsupposed to extend towards an Independent dissenter, or a member of the\r\nCountess of Huntingdon's connexion. The Independents differed from the\r\nPresbyterians in no one definite article of creed, with this\r\nexception--that they set no value upon _ordination_, and violently\r\nobjected to the restraining any good man from public preaching, or any\r\nof the ministrations of a pastor, because he wanted this authorisation\r\nof a visible church. For this point of \"religious freedom\" (an\r\nexpression which in their mouths has little other than this narrow\r\nsignification) they had to contend with the Presbyterians. The sect\r\nwhich has to resist oppression, or the restraints of power, uses, of\r\ncourse, the language of toleration. The Independents used it in their\r\ncontroversy with the Presbyterians, just as the latter had employed it\r\nin their controversy with Episcopacy. But Independents and Presbyterians\r\nwere alike intolerant of the Episcopalian or the Roman Catholic. All\r\nsects of that age preached toleration when a powerful adversary was to\r\nbe deprecated--preached it then, and then only. The Independents coming\r\nlast upon the field, preached it last; but they have no title beyond\r\nothers to the spirit of toleration. Cromwell put down the mass as he\r\nwould put down a rebellion--as openly, as decidedly, as rigorously.\r\n\r\n\"It is remarkable,\" continued the despatch, \"that these people, at the\r\nfirst, set up the mass in some places of the town that had been\r\nmonasteries; but afterwards grew so insolent, that, the last Lord's day\r\nbefore the storm, the Protestants were thrust out of the great church\r\ncalled St Peter's, and they had public mass there; and in this very\r\nplace near 1000 of them (_the Catholics--a clear judgment_) were put to\r\nthe sword, fleeing thither for safety. I believe all their friars were\r\nknocked on the head promiscuously but two; the one of which was Father\r\nPeter Taaff, brother to the Lord Taaff, whom the soldiers took the next\r\nday and made an end of. The other was taken in the Round Tower, under\r\nthe repute, (_the disguise_) of a lieutenant, and when he understood\r\nthat the officers in that tower had no quarter, he confessed he was a\r\nfriar; but that did not save him.\"\r\n\r\nIreland was no sooner subjected by this unflinching and terrific\r\nseverity, than the presence of the great general of the Commonwealth was\r\nneeded in Scotland. The Scots had no predilection for a republic, no\r\ndesire whatever for it; they were bent solely on their covenant, their\r\ncovenant and a Stuart king. It was a combination very difficult to\r\nachieve. Nevertheless they took their oath to both, and marched into\r\nEngland to establish them both over the United Kingdom. Here was\r\nsufficient enthusiasm at all events; sufficient, and of the proper kind,\r\none would think, to earn the sympathies of our editor. And he does look\r\nupon the Scots at this time as an \"heroic nation.\" But, unfortunately,\r\nit is precisely the heroic nation that his own great hero is about to\r\ncombat and subdue. He is compelled, therefore, upon his part, as the\r\nfaithful bard and minstrel of his chosen champion, to give them\r\nup--them, and their covenant, and Stuart king--to merciless sarcasm.\r\nIndeed, he tells us, that the great, the sole fault of the Scots, was\r\nprecisely this--that they did not produce a Cromwell. \"With Oliver born\r\nScotch,\" he says or sings, \"one sees not but the whole world might have\r\nbecome Puritan!\"\r\n\r\nHowever, he launches his Puritan hero against the godly and heroic\r\nnation with full sound of trumpet, not unmixed with a certain vague and\r\nsolemn voice of prophecy.\r\n\r\n\"In such spirit goes Oliver to the wars--a god-intoxicated man, as\r\nNovalis elsewhere phrases it. I have asked myself, if any where in\r\nmodern European history, or even in ancient Asiatic, there was found a\r\nman practising this mean world's affairs with a heart more filled by the\r\nidea of the Highest? Bathed in the eternal splendours--it is so he walks\r\nour dim earth: this man is one of few. He is projected with a terrible\r\nforce out of the Eternities, and in the Times and their arenas there is\r\nnothing that can withstand him. It is great; to us it is tragic; a thing\r\nthat should strike us dumb! My brave one, thy noble prophecy _is_\r\ndivine; older than Hebrew David; old as the origin of man; and shall,\r\nthough in wider ways than those supposed, be fulfilled.\"--(P. 172.)\r\n\r\nWe feel no disposition to follow Cromwell to the Scottish wars, though\r\n\"bathed in the eternal splendours.\" We hardly know of any thing in\r\nhistory to our taste more odious than this war between the Scottish\r\nCovenanter and the English Puritan; the one praying clamorously for\r\nvictory against \"a blaspheming general and a sectarian army;\" the other\r\nanimating his battle with a psalm, and charging with a \"Lord, arise! and\r\nlet thy enemies be scattered,\" or some such exclamation. Both generals,\r\nin the intervals of actual war, sermonise each other, and with much the\r\nsame spirit that they fight. Their diplomacy is a tangled preachment,\r\nand texts are their war-cries. Meanwhile, both are fighting for the\r\ngospel of Christ! only one will have it _with_, the other _without_ the\r\ncovenant! Such \"eternal splendours\" are not inviting to us. We will step\r\non at once to the battle of Worcester, which concluded both the Scottish\r\nwar, and all hopes for the present of the royalist party.\r\n\r\nThis last of his battles and his victories dismisses the great Puritan\r\nfrom the wars. It is a striking despatch he writes from the field of\r\nWorcester. He is still the unmitigated Puritan; he still preaches to\r\nSpeaker Lenthall, but he preaches somewhat more dogmatically. There is\r\nan air of authority in the sermon. We all know that godly exhortation\r\nmay be made to express almost every shade of human passion; as what son\r\nand what wife has not felt who has lived under the dominion and\r\ndiscourse of one of these \"rulers in Israel.\" The Parliament felt, no\r\ndoubt, the difference between the sermons of their general and those of\r\ntheir chaplain.\r\n\r\nCromwell and the army return to London. It is now that the Commonwealth\r\nis to be really put upon its trial. Hitherto the army, that had made and\r\ncould unmake it, had been occupied first in Ireland, then in Scotland;\r\nand the minds of people at home had been equally occupied in watching\r\nits achievements. The Commonwealth has lived upon the expectations of\r\nmen. It has been itself an expectation. It is now to be perfected, its\r\norganisation to be completed, its authority established.\r\n\r\nBut Cromwell was not a Washington. Not only did he want that serene and\r\nsteady virtue which counselled the champion of American independence to\r\nretire into the ranks of the constitution--commander in the field,\r\nprivate soldier in the city--not only did he fail in this civic virtue,\r\nand found it hard to resign the sway and authority he had so long\r\nexercised; but the inestimable advantages of a constitutional government\r\nhis mind had not been cultivated to appreciate. His thoughts had\r\nhitherto taken another direction. His speculative habits theology had\r\nmoulded; his active habits had been formed in the camp. He felt that he\r\ncould administer the government better than any of the men around him:\r\nwe will give him credit, too, for the full intention to administer it\r\nconscientiously, and for the good of the nation; but for those enlarged\r\nviews of the more enlightened patriot, who is solicitous to provide not\r\nalone for the present necessities, but for the future long life of a\r\npeople--he had them not. He grew afterwards into the statesman, as he\r\nhad grown into the soldier; but at this time the Puritan general had\r\nvery little respect for human institutions.\r\n\r\nWe are far from asserting, that even with the assistance of Cromwell a\r\nrepublic could have been established in England. But he lent no helping\r\nhand; his great abilities, his fervent zeal, were never employed in this\r\nservice. He kept aloof--aloof with the army. He gathered himself to his\r\nfull height, standing amidst the ruins of the civil war: all men might\r\nsee that he alone kept his footing there. When the unhappy Parliament,\r\nstruggling with its cruel embarrassments, not knowing how to dissolve\r\nitself with safety, had brought down on it the impatience, the distrust,\r\nthe contempt of men--when he had allowed its members to reap the full\r\nharvest of a people's jealousies and suspicions--when at length they\r\nwere on the point of extricating themselves by a bill determining the\r\nmode of electing a successor--_then_ he interfered, and dissolved them!\r\n\r\nA question may be raised, how far Cromwell had the power, if such had\r\nbeen his wish, to take over the army to the side of the Parliament, to\r\nlead it into due allegiance to the Commonwealth. The officers of the\r\narmy and the members of the Parliament formed the two rival powers in\r\nthe kingdom. Cromwell, it may be said, _could_ not have united them,\r\ncould only make his choice between them. It would have been only a\r\nfraction of the army that he could have carried over with him. The\r\ndivision between the council of officers and the Parliament was too\r\nwide, the alienation too confirmed and inveterate, to have been healed\r\nby one man, though it was the Lord General himself. Thus, it may be said\r\nthat Cromwell, in the part he acted against the Long Parliament, was\r\nthrust forward by a revolutionary movement, which, according to the law\r\nof such movements, must either have carried him forward in the van, or\r\nleft him deserted or down-trodden in the rear.\r\n\r\nThis would be no flattering excuse. But whatever truth there may be in\r\nthis view of the case, Cromwell never manifested any intention or any\r\ndesire to quit the cause of the army for that of the Parliament. He was\r\nheart and soul with the army; it was there his power lay; it was there\r\nhe found the spirits he most sympathised with. He walked at the head of\r\nthe army here as in the war. It was alone that he entered the House of\r\nParliament--alone \"in his gray stockings and black coat,\" with no staff\r\nof officers about him, no military parade, only a few of his Ironsides\r\nin the lobby. Though aware he should have the support of his officers,\r\nthere is no proof that he had consulted them. The daring deed was _his_.\r\nAnd it is one of the most daring deeds on record. The execution of the\r\nKing--in that day when kings were something more in the imagination of\r\nmen than they are now--was indeed an audacious act. But it was shared\r\nwith others. This dissolution of the Parliament, and assumption of the\r\ndictatorship--this facing alone all his old compeers, met in due\r\nlegislative dignity, and bidding them one and all depart--strikes us as\r\nthe bolder deed.\r\n\r\nThe scene has been often described, but nowhere so well, or so fully, as\r\nby Mr Carlyle. We cannot resist the pleasure of quoting his spirited\r\naccount of this notable transaction.\r\n\r\n     \"The Parliament sitting as usual, and being in debate upon the\r\n     bill, which it was thought would have been passed that day,\r\n     'the Lord General Cromwell came into the House, clad in plain\r\n     black clothes and gray worsted stockings, and sat down, as he\r\n     used to do, in an ordinary place.' For some time he listens to\r\n     this interesting debate on the bill, beckoning once to\r\n     Harrison, who came over to him, and answered dubitatingly.\r\n     Whereupon the Lord General sat still for about a quarter of an\r\n     hour longer. But now the question being to be put, That this\r\n     bill do now pass, he beckons again to Harrison, says, 'This is\r\n     the time; I must do it!' and so 'rose up, put off his hat, and\r\n     spake. At the first, and for a good while, he spake to the\r\n     commendation of the Parliament, for their pains and care of the\r\n     public good; but afterwards he changed his style, told them of\r\n     their injustice, delays of justice, self-interest, and other\r\n     faults,' rising higher and higher into a very aggravated style\r\n     indeed. An honourable member, Sir Peter Wentworth by name, not\r\n     known to my readers, and by me better known than trusted, rises\r\n     to order, as we phrase it; says, 'It is a strange language\r\n     this; unusual within the walls of Parliament this! And from a\r\n     trusted servant, too; and one whom we have so highly honoured;\r\n     and one--' Come, come,' exclaims my Lord General, in a very\r\n     high key, 'we have had enough of this'--and in fact my Lord\r\n     General, now blazing all up into clear conflagration, exclaims,\r\n     'I will put an end to your prating,' and steps forth into the\r\n     floor of the House, and 'clapping on his hat,' and occasionally\r\n     'stamping the floor with his feet,' begins a discourse which no\r\n     man can report! He says--Heavens! he is heard saying: 'It is\r\n     not fit that you should sit here any longer!' You have sat too\r\n     long here for any good you have been doing lately, 'You shall\r\n     now give place to better men! Call them in!' adds he, briefly,\r\n     to Harrison, in way of command; and some 'twenty or thirty'\r\n     grim musketeers enter, with bullets in their snaphances; grimly\r\n     prompt for orders; and stand in some attitude of carry arms\r\n     there. Veteran men: men of might and men of war, their faces\r\n     are as the faces of lions, and their feet are swift as the roes\r\n     upon the mountains; not beautiful to honourable gentlemen at\r\n     this moment!\r\n\r\n     \"'You call yourselves a Parliament,' continues my Lord General,\r\n     in clear blaze of conflagration. 'You are no Parliament! Some\r\n     of you are drunkards,' and his eye flashes on poor Mr Chalmer,\r\n     an official man of some value, addicted to the bottle; 'some of\r\n     you are'--and he glares into Henry Martin and the poor Sir\r\n     Peter, who rose to order, lewd livers both--'living in open\r\n     contempt of God's, commandments. Following your own greedy\r\n     appetites, and the devil's commandments. Corrupt, unjust\r\n     persons,' and here I think he glanced 'at Sir Bulstrode\r\n     Whitlocke, one of the Commissioners of the Great Seal, giving\r\n     him and others very sharp language, though he named them not.'\r\n     'Corrupt, unjust persons, scandalous to the profession of the\r\n     Gospel:' how can you be a Parliament for God's people? Depart,\r\n     I say, and let us have done with you. In the name, of God--go!\r\n\r\n     \"The House is of course all on its feet--uncertain, almost,\r\n     whether not on its head: such a scene as was never seen before\r\n     in any House of Commons. History reports with a shudder that my\r\n     Lord General, lifting the sacred mace itself, said, 'What shall\r\n     we do with this bauble? Take it away!'--and gave it to a\r\n     musketeer. And now--'Fetch him down!' says he to Harrison,\r\n     flashing on the Speaker. Speaker Lenthall, more an ancient\r\n     Roman than any thing else, declares, He will not come till\r\n     forced. 'Sir,' said Harrison, 'I will lend you a hand;' on\r\n     which Speaker Lenthall came down, and gloomily vanished. They\r\n     all vanished; flooding gloomily, clamorously out, to their\r\n     ulterior businesses, and respective places of abode: the Long\r\n     Parliament is dissolved! 'It's you that have forced me to\r\n     this,' exclaims my Lord General, 'I have sought the Lord night\r\n     and day, that He would rather slay me than put me upon the\r\n     doing of this work.' 'At their going out, some say the Lord\r\n     General said to young Sir Harry Vane, calling him by his name,\r\n     That _he_ might have prevented this; but that he was a juggler,\r\n     and had not common honesty.' 'O Sir Harry Vane,' thou, with thy\r\n     subtle casuistries and abstruse hair-splittings, thou art other\r\n     than a good one, I think! 'The Lord deliver me from thee, Sir\r\n     Harry Vane!' 'All being gone out, the door of the House was\r\n     locked, and the key, with the mace, as I heard, was carried\r\n     away by Colonel Otley,' and it is all over, and the unspeakable\r\n     catastrophe has come, and remains.\"--(Vol. ii. p. 361.)\r\n\r\nThe usurpation of Cromwell is, we believe, generally considered as the\r\nmost fortunate event which, under the peculiar circumstances of the\r\ncountry, could have occurred. The people, it is said; were not prepared\r\nfor a republic. The attempt, therefore, to establish one, would have\r\nbeen attended by incessant tumults; its short and precarious existence\r\nwould have been supported by the scaffold and the prison. It would have\r\nterminated indeed, as did the Protectorate, in a Restoration, but the\r\ninterval between the death of Charles I. and the accession of his son,\r\nwould have been passed in a very different manner. Under the\r\nProtectorate the country rallied its strength, put forth its naval\r\npower, obtained peace at home, and respect abroad. Under a republic, it\r\nwould have probably spent its force, and demoralised itself, in\r\nintestine strife and by a succession of revolutionary movements.\r\n\r\nBut if this view be quite correct, it will not justify Cromwell. It is\r\none thing to be satisfied with the course of events, quite another with\r\nthe conduct of the several agents in them. Cromwell, in the position in\r\nwhich he stood, as an honest man and a patriot, should have done his\r\nbest for the establishment of the Commonwealth; and this he did not. We\r\nare far, as we have said, from venturing to give a decisive opinion on\r\nthe probability (with the united efforts of the victorious general and\r\nthe Parliament) of forming a republic. But we are not disposed to think\r\nthat the cause was hopeless. Had the Parliament been allowed to recruit\r\nits numbers without dissolving itself--the measure which it constantly\r\ndesired, and which Cromwell would not hear of, though, without a doubt,\r\nit was the very line of conduct which his own practical sagacity would\r\nhave led him to, if his heart had been in the business--the minds of men\r\nwould have had time to settle and reflect, and a mode of government,\r\nwhich had already existed for some years, might have been adopted by the\r\ngeneral consent.\r\n\r\n_We_ look upon the Restoration very calmly, very satisfactorily, for\r\nwhom a second revolution has placed another dynasty upon the throne,\r\ngoverning upon principles quite different from those which were rooted\r\nin the Stuarts. We see the Restoration, with the Revolution of 1688 at\r\nits back, and almost consider them as one event. But a most loyal and\r\ncontented subject of Queen Victoria, would have been a Commonwealthsman\r\nin those days. How could it then have been foreseen that all the power,\r\nand privilege, and splendour of royalty, should exist only to _protect_\r\nthe law, to secure the equal rights of all--that monarchy, retaining a\r\ntraditionary awe and majesty derived from remote times, should remain\r\namongst us to supply to a representative government that powerful,\r\nconstant, and impartial executive which, from the mere elements of a\r\nrepublic, it is so difficult to extract? Who could have imagined that a\r\npopular legislature, and the supremacy of the law, could have been so\r\nfortunately combined and secured under the shadow of the monarchy?\r\nEnlightened minds at that time could not have looked calmly towards a\r\nRestoration; they probably thought, or would have been led to think,\r\nthat, in the position they then were, it was better to take the\r\nconstitution of Holland, than the government of France, for their model.\r\n\r\nBut the multitude--with what enthusiasm they welcomed the restoration of\r\nthe Stuarts! Very true. But the Protectorate was no antagonist to\r\nmonarchy. Republican pride was never called forth to contend in the\r\npublic mind against the feeling of loyalty, and an attachment to kings.\r\nThe Protectorate was itself a monarchy without its splendour, or the\r\nprestige of hereditary greatness. It was a monarchy under the Geneva\r\ngown. Was it likely that the populace would accept of this in lieu of\r\nthe crowned and jewelled royalty which was wont to fill its imagination?\r\n\r\nHowever, the experiment--fortunately for us, as the result has turned\r\nout--was never destined to be made. Cromwell dissolved the Long\r\nParliament. He now stood alone, he and the army, the sole power in the\r\nstate. His first measure, that of sending a summons in his own name, to\r\npersons of his own choice, and thus, without any popular election\r\nwhatever, assembling what is called the Little Parliament, or Barebones\r\nParliament, shows a singular audacity, and proves how little trammelled\r\nhe was himself by traditionary or constitutional maxims. He who would\r\nnot allow the Long Parliament to recruit its numbers, and thus escape\r\nthe perils of a free election of an altogether new assembly, extricates\r\nhimself from the same embarrassment by electing the whole Parliament\r\nhimself. Some historians have represented this measure as having for its\r\nvery object to create additional confusion, and render himself, and his\r\nown dictatorial power, more necessary to the state. It has not appeared\r\nto us in this light. We see in it a bold but rude assay at government.\r\nIn this off-hand manner of constituting a Parliament, we detect the\r\nmingled daring of the Puritan and the Soldier. In neither of these\r\ncharacters was he likely to have much respect for legal maxims, or rules\r\nof merely human contrivance. Cromwell was educating himself for the\r\nStatesman: at this juncture it is the Puritan General that we have\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\nThe Little Parliament having blundered on till it had got itself\r\nentangled in the Mosaic dispensation, resigned its power into the hands\r\nof him who had bestowed it. Thereupon a new _Instrument of Government_\r\nis framed, with the advice of the council of officers, appointing\r\nCromwell Protector, and providing for the election of a Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis Parliament being elected, falls, of course, on the discussion of\r\nthis very Instrument of government. Henceforth Cromwell's great\r\ndifficulty is the management of his Parliaments. The speeches he\r\ndelivered to them at various times, and which occupy the third volume of\r\nthe work before us, are of high historical interest. They are in every\r\nrespect superior to his letters. Neither will their perusal be found to\r\nbe of that arduous and painful nature which, from the reputation they\r\nhave had, most persons will be disposed to expect. The _sermon_ may\r\nweary, but the _speech_ is always fraught with meaning; and the mixture\r\nof sermon and speech together, portray the man with singular\r\ndistinctness. We see the Puritan divine, the Puritan soldier, becoming\r\nthe Puritan statesman. His originally powerful mind is excited to fresh\r\nexertion by his onerous and exalted position. But he is still constant\r\nto himself. Very interesting is the exhibition presented to us of this\r\npowerful intellect, breaking out in flashes of strong sense, and\r\nrelapsing again into the puerilities of the sect. But as it falls upon\r\nthe strong sense to _act_, and on the puerilities only to _preach_, the\r\nman comes out, upon the whole, as a great and able governor.\r\n\r\nThe reputation which Oliver's speeches have borne, as being involved,\r\nspiritless, tortuous, and even purposely confused, has resulted, we\r\nthink, from this--that an opinion of the whole has been formed from an\r\nexamination of a few, and chiefly of those which were delivered on the\r\noccasion of his refusing the offered title of king. His conduct on this\r\noccasion, it would be necessary for an historian particularly to\r\ninvestigate, and in the discharge of this duty he would have to peruse a\r\nseries of discourses undoubtedly of a very bewildering character. They\r\nare the only speeches of Cromwell of which it can be said that their\r\nmeaning is not clearly, and even forcibly expressed. And in this case it\r\nis quite evident, that he had no distinct meaning to express; he had no\r\ndefinite answer to give the Parliament who were petitioning him to take\r\nthe title of king. He was anxious to gain time--he was talking _against\r\ntime_--an art which we moderns only have thoroughly mastered. How could\r\nCromwell, who was no great rhetorician, be otherwise than palpably\r\nconfused, and dubious and intricate? Nothing can be clearer than that he\r\nhimself leant towards the opinion of the Parliament, that it would be\r\ngood policy to adopt the royal title. It was so connected with the old\r\nattachments and associations of Englishmen, it had so long given force\r\nto the language of the law, its claims were so much better known, its\r\nprerogatives so much better understood than those of the new title of\r\nProtector, that the resumption of it must have appeared very advisable.\r\nBut the army had been all along fighting against _the King_. Whilst to\r\nthe lawyer and the citizen the title was still the most honourable and\r\never to be venerated, to the soldier of the Commonwealth it had become a\r\nterm of reproach, of execration, of unsparing hostility. Oliver Cromwell\r\nmight well hesitate before assuming a title which might forfeit for him\r\nthe allegiance of a great portion of the army. He deferred his answer,\r\nto have an opportunity for estimating the nature and amount of the\r\nresistance he might expect from that quarter; and he came to the\r\nconclusion, that the risk of unsettling the affections of the army was\r\nnot to be incurred for either any personal gratification to himself\r\n(which we take to have not weighed much with him) in assuming the title\r\nof king, or for the advantages which might accrue from it in the\r\nultimate settlement of the nation. His addresses, therefore, to the\r\nParliament on this occasion not being definite answers to the\r\nParliament, nor intended to be such, but mere postponements of his\r\nanswer, were necessarily distinguished by indecision, uncertainty, and\r\nall sorts of obscurities. But, these excepted, his speeches, however\r\ndeficient in what pertains to the _art of composition_, in terseness, or\r\nmethod, or elegance of phrase, are never wanting in the great\r\nessentials--the expression of his meaning in a very earnest and forcible\r\nmanner. The mixture of sermon and speech, we allow, is not inviting; but\r\nthe sermon is just as clear, perhaps, as any which the chaplain of the\r\nHouse would have preached to them, and it must be remembered, that to\r\nexplain _his_ meaning, _his_ political sentiments, the sermon was as\r\nnecessary as the speech.\r\n\r\nBy the new instrument of government, the Protector, with his council,\r\nwas authorised, in the interval before the meeting of Parliament, to\r\nissue such ordinances as might be deemed necessary. This interval our\r\nPuritan governor very consistently employed, first of all, in\r\nestablishing a gospel ministry throughout the nation. Thirty-eight\r\nchosen men, \"the acknowledged flower of English Puritanism,\" were\r\nnominated a Supreme Commission, for the trial of public preachers. Any\r\nperson holding a church-living, or pretending to the tithes or\r\nclergy-dues, was to be tried and approved of by these men. \"A very\r\nrepublican arrangement,\" says Mr Carlyle, \"such as could be made on the\r\nsudden, but was found in practice to work well.\"\r\n\r\nThis and other ordinances having been issued, his first Parliament\r\nmeets. It cannot be said that our Puritan Protector does not rise to the\r\nfull level of his position. One might describe him as something of a\r\npropagandist, disposed to teach his doctrine of _the rights of\r\nChristian men_ to the world at large. It is thus he opens his\r\naddress:--\"GENTLEMEN, You are met here on the greatest occasion that, I\r\nbelieve, England ever saw; having upon your shoulders the interests of\r\nthree great nations, with the territories belonging to them: and truly I\r\nbelieve I may say it without any hyperbole, you have upon your shoulders\r\n_the interest of all the Christian people in the world_. And the\r\nexpectation is, that I should let you know, as far as I have cognisance\r\nof it, the occasion of your assembling together at this time.\"\r\n\r\nBut this Parliament fell upon the discussion, as we have said, of the\r\nvery instrument of government under which they had been called together.\r\nMr Carlyle is as impatient as was Oliver himself at this proceeding of\r\nthe \"Talking apparatus.\" But how could it be otherwise? Every thing\r\nthat had taken place since the dissolution of the Long Parliament was\r\ndone by mere arbitrary authority. The present Parliament, however called\r\ntogether, must consider itself the only legitimate, the only\r\nconstitutional power: it _must_ look into this instrument of government.\r\nBut if it was impossible not to commence the discussion, it was equally\r\nimpossible ever to conclude it. We all know to what length a debate will\r\nrun upon a constitutional question; and here there was not one such\r\nquestion, but a whole constitution to be discussed. In vain they debated\r\n\"from eight in the morning to eight at night, with an hour for\r\nrefreshment about noon:\" there was no probability of their ever coming\r\nto a conclusion.\r\n\r\nThis would never do. Oliver shuts up the Parliament-house, stations his\r\nmusketeers at the door, calls the members to him, presents them with a\r\nparchment, \"a little thing,\" to sign, acknowledging his authority, and\r\ntells them he will open the door of the House to such only as shall put\r\ntheir names to it. We will quote some parts of the speech he made to\r\nthem on this occasion, and our readers shall judge whether such a\r\nspeech, delivered by the living man Cromwell, was likely to fail in\r\neffect, whether it was deficient in meaning or in energy. We shall omit\r\nthe parenthetical comments of the editor, because, however these may\r\namuse and relieve the reader who is making his way through the whole\r\nwork, and who becomes familiarised with their style, they would only\r\nconfuse and distract the attention in a brief extract. The single words\r\nor phrases which he has introduced, merely to make the sense clear, are\r\nretained whenever they are really necessary for this purpose, and\r\nwithout the inverted commas by which they are properly distinguished in\r\nthe text. We will premise, that the protestations which Cromwell here\r\nmakes, that he did not seek the government, but was earnestly petitioned\r\nto undertake it, may well, in part, be true. When he had once dissolved\r\nthe Long Parliament, it was no longer a matter of choice for himself or\r\nothers whether he would take the reins of government. To whom could he\r\ncommit them? From that time, the government rested upon his shoulders.\r\nIf he had manifested a wish to withdraw from the burden he had thus\r\nbrought down upon himself, there is no doubt but that he would have been\r\nearnestly petitioned to remain at his post. The greatest enemy of\r\nCromwell, if he had been a lover of his country, would have joined in\r\nsuch a petition; would have besought him to remain at the helm, now he\r\nhad thrown all other steersmen overboard. No; he must not quit it now.\r\nHe is there for the rest of his life, to do battle with the waves, and\r\nnavigate amongst rocks and quicksands as best he may.\r\n\r\nLet us hear his own statement and defence of the manner in which he\r\nbecame advanced and \"captive\" to his high and perilous place.\r\n\r\n     \"GENTLEMEN,--It is not long since I met you in this place, upon\r\n     an occasion which gave me much more content and comfort than\r\n     this doth. That which I have now to say to you will need no\r\n     preamble to let me into my discourse; for the occasion of this\r\n     meeting is plain enough. I could have wished, with all my\r\n     heart, there had been no cause for it.\r\n\r\n     \"At our former meeting I did acquaint you what was the first\r\n     rise of this government which hath called you hither, and by\r\n     the authority of which you have come hither. Among other things\r\n     which I then told you of, I said you were a Free Parliament;\r\n     and so you are, whilst you own the government and authority\r\n     which called you hither. But certainly that word (Free\r\n     Parliament) implied a reciprocity, or it implied nothing at\r\n     all. Indeed, there was a reciprocity implied and expressed; and\r\n     I think your actions and carriages ought to be suitable. But I\r\n     see it will be necessary for me now a little to magnify my\r\n     office, which I have not been apt to do. I have been of this\r\n     mind, I have been always of this mind, since I first entered\r\n     upon my office. If God will not bear it up, let it sink!--but\r\n     if a duty be incumbent upon me, to bear my testimony to it,\r\n     (which in modesty I have hitherto forborne,) I am, in some\r\n     measure, necessitated thereunto: and therefore that will be the\r\n     prologue to my discourse.\r\n\r\n     \"I called not myself to this place. I say again, I called not\r\n     myself to this place! Of that God is witness: and I have many\r\n     witnesses who, I do believe, could lay down their lives bearing\r\n     witness to the truth of that, namely, that I called not myself\r\n     to this place! And, being in it, I bear not witness to myself\r\n     or my office; but God and the people of these nations have also\r\n     borne testimony to it. If my calling be from God, and my\r\n     testimony from the people, _God and the people shall take it\r\n     from me, else I will not part with it!_ I should be false to\r\n     the trust that God hath placed in me, and to the interest of\r\n     the people of these nations if I did.\r\n\r\n     \"I was by birth a gentleman; living neither in any considerable\r\n     height, nor yet in obscurity. I have been called to several\r\n     employments in the nation--to serve in Parliament and others;\r\n     and, not to be over-tedious, I did endeavour to discharge the\r\n     duty of an honest man, in those services, to God and his\r\n     people's interest, and to the Commonwealth; having, when time\r\n     was, a competent acceptation in the hearts of men, and some\r\n     evidences thereof. I resolve not to recite the times, and\r\n     occasions, and opportunities, which have been appointed me by\r\n     God to serve him in; nor the presence and blessing of God,\r\n     therein bearing testimony to me.\r\n\r\n     \"Having had some occasion to see, together with my brethren and\r\n     countrymen, a happy period put to our sharp wars and contests\r\n     with the then common enemy, I hoped, in a private capacity, to\r\n     have reaped the fruit and benefit, together with my brethren,\r\n     of our hard labours and hazards: the enjoyment, to wit, of\r\n     peace and liberty, and the privileges of a Christian and a man,\r\n     in some equality with others, according as it should please the\r\n     Lord to dispense unto me. And when I say God had put an end to\r\n     our wars, or at least brought them to a very hopeful issue,\r\n     very near an end,--after Worcester fight,--I came up to London\r\n     to pay my service and duty to the Parliament which then sat,\r\n     hoping that all minds would have been disposed to answer what\r\n     seemed to be the mind of God, namely, to give peace and rest to\r\n     his people, and especially to those who had bled more than\r\n     others in the carrying on of the military affairs,--I was much\r\n     disappointed of my expectation. For the issue did not prove so.\r\n     _Whatever may be boasted or misrepresented, it was not so, not\r\n     so!_\r\n\r\n     \"I can say in the simplicity of my soul, I love not, I love\r\n     not,--I declined it in my former speech,--I say, I love not to\r\n     rake into sores, or to discover nakednesses! The thing I drive\r\n     at is this: I say to you, I hoped to have had leave to retire\r\n     to a private life. I begged to be dismissed of my charge; I\r\n     begged it again and again; and God be judge between me and all\r\n     men if I lie in this matter! That I lie not in matter of fact,\r\n     is known to very many; but whether I tell a lie in my heart, as\r\n     labouring to represent to you what was not upon my heart, I say\r\n     the Lord be judge. Let uncharitable men, who measure others by\r\n     themselves, judge as they please. As to the matter of fact, I\r\n     say it is true. As to the ingenuity and integrity of my heart\r\n     in that desire--I do appeal, as before, upon the truth of that\r\n     also. But I could not obtain what my soul longed for. And the\r\n     plain truth is, I did afterwards apprehend some more of\r\n     opinion, (such the differences of their judgment from mine,)\r\n     that it could not well be.\r\n\r\n     \"I confess I am in some strait to say what I could say, and\r\n     what is true, of what then followed. I pressed the Parliament,\r\n     as a member, to period themselves; once and again, and again,\r\n     and ten, nay twenty times over. I told them, for I knew it\r\n     better than any one man in the parliament could know it,\r\n     because of my manner of life, which had led me every where up\r\n     and down the nation, thereby giving me to see and know the\r\n     temper and spirits of all men, and of the best of men--that the\r\n     nation loathed their sitting. I knew it. And so far as I could\r\n     discern, when they _were_ dissolved, _there was not so much as\r\n     the barking of a dog_, or any general or visible repining at\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     \"And that there was high cause for their dissolution, is most\r\n     evident: not only in regard there was a just fear of that\r\n     parliament's perpetuating themselves, but because it actually\r\n     was their design. Had not their heels been trod upon by\r\n     importunities from abroad, even to threats, I believe there\r\n     never would have been any thoughts of rising, or of going out\r\n     of that room, to the world's end. I myself was sounded, and by\r\n     no mean persons tempted; and proposals were made me to that\r\n     very end: that the parliament might be thus perpetuated; that\r\n     the vacant places might be supplied by new elections, and so\r\n     continue from generation to generation.\"\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to object to the measure which the Parliament was really\r\nabout to pass, that it would have established an uninterrupted\r\nsuccession of Parliaments, that there would have been \"a legislative\r\npower always sitting,\" which would thereby have encroached upon the\r\nexecutive power. The speech then enlarges on the general assent of the\r\npeople, of the army, of the judges, of the civic powers, to the\r\ninstrument of government, to the Protectorate, and on the implied\r\nassent which they themselves had given by accepting their commissions\r\nunder it.\r\n\r\n     \"And this being so, though I told you in my last speech that\r\n     you were a free Parliament, yet I thought it was understood\r\n     withal that I was the Protector, and the authority that called\r\n     you! That I was in possession of the government by a good right\r\n     from God and man. And I believe, that if the learnedest men in\r\n     this nation were called to show a precedent equally clear of a\r\n     government so many ways approved of, they would not in all\r\n     their search find it. And if the fact be so, why should we\r\n     sport with it? With a business so serious!... For you to disown\r\n     or not to own it; for you to act with parliamentary authority\r\n     especially, in the disowning of it, contrary to the very\r\n     fundamental things, yea against the very root itself of this\r\n     establishment, to sit and not own the authority by which you\r\n     sit--is that which I believe astonisheth more men than myself;\r\n     and doth as dangerously disappoint and discompose the nation,\r\n     as any thing that could have been invented by the greatest\r\n     enemy to our peace and welfare.\"\r\n\r\nAfter drawing the distinction between fundamentals, which may not be\r\nshaken, and circumstantials, which it is in the power of Parliament to\r\nalter and modify, he continues:--\r\n\r\n     \"I would it had not been needful for me to call you hither to\r\n     expostulate these things with you, and in such a manner as\r\n     this! But necessity hath no law. Feigned necessities, imaginary\r\n     necessities, are the greatest cozenage which man can put upon\r\n     the providence of God, and make pretences to break known rules\r\n     by. But it is as legal, as carnal, and as stupid to think that\r\n     there are _no_ necessities which are manifest and real, because\r\n     necessities may be abused or feigned. I have to say, the wilful\r\n     throwing away of this government, such as it is, so owned by\r\n     God, so approved by men, so witnessed to, as was mentioned\r\n     above, were a thing which--and in reference to the good of\r\n     these nations and of posterity--_I can sooner be willing to be\r\n     rolled into my grave and buried with infamy, than I can give my\r\n     consent unto!_\r\n\r\n     \"You have been called hither to save a nation--nations. You had\r\n     the best people, indeed, of the Christian world put into your\r\n     trust, when you came hither. You had the affairs of these\r\n     nations delivered over to you in peace and quiet; you were, and\r\n     we all are, put into an undisturbed possession, nobody making\r\n     title to us: Through the blessing of God, our enemies were\r\n     hopeless and scattered. We had peace at home; peace with almost\r\n     all our neighbours round about. To have our peace and interest,\r\n     whereof those were our hopes the other day, thus shaken, and\r\n     put under such a confusion; and ourselves rendered hereby\r\n     almost the scorn and contempt of those strangers who are\r\n     amongst us to negotiate their masters' affairs!... Who shall\r\n     answer for these things to God or to men? To men, to the people\r\n     who sent you hither? who looked for refreshment from you; who\r\n     looked for nothing but peace and quietness, and rest and\r\n     settlement? When we come to give an account to them, we shall\r\n     have it to say, 'Oh, we quarrelled for the _Liberty of\r\n     England_; we contested, and went to confusion for\r\n     that!--_Wherein, I pray you, for the Liberty of England?_ I\r\n     appeal to the Lord, that the desires and endeavours we have\r\n     had--nay, the things will speak for themselves,--the liberty of\r\n     England, the liberty of the people, the avoiding of tyrannous\r\n     impositions either upon men as men, or Christians as\r\n     Christians,--is made so safe by this act of settlement, that it\r\n     will speak for itself.\"\r\n\r\nThe Protector then tells them that, \"seeing the authority which\r\ncalled them is so little valued and so much slighted, he had\r\ncaused a stop to be put to their entrance into the Parliament-house,\"\r\nuntil a certain \"somewhat,\" which would be found \"in the lobby\r\nwithout the Parliament-door\"--an adhesion to the government in its\r\nfundamentals--should be signed.\r\n\r\nThis extract, as will be readily supposed, would lead to a far too\r\nfavourable opinion of Cromwell's oratory, if understood as a specimen of\r\nhis usual manner of speaking; but our readers will probably confess,\r\nthat they did not expect that the speeches of Cromwell would have\r\nyielded such an extract.\r\n\r\nOliver has, it will be observed, a singularly modest way of speaking of\r\nhis political remedies and projects. In referring, on a later occasion,\r\nto his major-generals, he says, \"Truly when that insurrection was, we\r\ndid find out a _little poor invention_, which I hear has been much\r\nregretted. I say there was _a little thing_ invented, which was the\r\nerecting of your major-generals, to have a little inspection upon the\r\npeople thus divided, thus discontented, thus dissatisfied.\" On the\r\npresent occasion, the \"somewhat which was to be found at the lobby of\r\nthe Parliament-door,\" was, after a little demur, accepted and signed by\r\nall but a certain number of declared republicans. The parliament\r\nafterwards fell from the discussion of a whole constitution, to debates\r\napparently as warm, and as endless, upon poor Biddle the Quaker, and\r\nother kindred subjects. Thus their allotted session of five months\r\npassed; at the end of which time Cromwell dissolved them.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what you have been doing,\" he tells them in his speech on\r\nthis occasion. \"I do not know whether you have been alive or dead. I\r\nhave not once heard from you all this time--I have not--and that you all\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nCromwell's second parliament manifested a wiser industry, and a more\r\nharmonious temper--thanks to one of the Protector's \"little inventions.\"\r\nEach member was to be provided with a certificate before entering the\r\nhouse; \"but near one hundred honourable gentlemen can get no\r\ncertificate--none provided for _them_--and without certificate there is\r\nno admittance. Soldiers stand ranked at the door; no man enters without\r\nhis certificate!\" The stiff republicans, and known turbalent persons,\r\nare excluded. From this Parliament Cromwell accepts again the title of\r\nProtector, and is installed with great state; things take a more legal\r\naspect; the major-generals are suppressed; a House of Lords is\r\ninstituted; and a settlement of the nation seems at last effected.\r\n\r\nBut the second session of this Parliament relapsed again into a restive\r\nand republican humour. The excluded members had been admitted, and\r\ndebates arose about this \"other house,\" as they were disposed to\r\nnominate the Lords. So much confusion resulted in the country from this\r\nunsettled state of the representative assembly, and so many\r\ninsurrectionary designs were fostered by it, that the Protector was\r\ncompelled abruptly to dissolve the Parliament. He tells them:--\r\n\r\n     \"That which brought me into the capacity I now stand in, was\r\n     the petition and advice given me by you, who, in reference to\r\n     the ancient constitution, did draw me to accept the place of\r\n     Protector. _There is not a man living can say I sought it; no,\r\n     not a man nor a woman treading upon English ground._ But,\r\n     contemplating the sad condition of these nations, relieved from\r\n     an intestine war into a six or seven years' peace, I did think\r\n     the nation happy therein. But to be petitioned thereunto, and\r\n     to be advised by you to undertake such a government, a burden\r\n     too heavy for any creature--and this to be done by the House\r\n     which then had the legislative capacity--certainly I did look\r\n     that the same men who made the frame, should make it good unto\r\n     me. _I can say, in the presence of God, in comparison with whom\r\n     we are but like poor creeping ants upon the earth, I would have\r\n     been glad to have lived under any woodside, to have kept a\r\n     flock of sheep, rather then have undertaken such a government\r\n     as this._ But, undertaking it by the advice and petition of\r\n     you, I did look that you who had offered it unto me, should\r\n     make it good.\"\r\n\r\nHe concludes thus:--\r\n\r\n     \"It hath been not only your endeavour to pervert the army while\r\n     you have been sitting, and to draw them to state the question\r\n     about a 'Commonwealth;' but some of you have been listing of\r\n     persons, by commission of Charles Stuart, to join with any\r\n     insurrection that may be made. And what is like to come upon\r\n     this, the enemy being ready to invade us, but even present\r\n     blood and confusion? And if this be so, I do assign it to this\r\n     cause--your not assenting to what you did invite me to by your\r\n     petition and advice, as that which might prove the settlement\r\n     of the nation. And if this be the end of your sitting, and this\r\n     be your carriage, I think it high time that an end be put to\r\n     your sitting. And I do dissolve this Parliament! And let God be\r\n     judge between you and me!\"\r\n\r\nIt is at this latter period of his career that the character of\r\nCromwell, to our apprehension, stands out to greatest advantage, becomes\r\nmore grave, and solemn, and estimable. Other dictators, other men of\r\nambitious aims and fortunes, show themselves, for the most part, less\r\namiable, more tyrannous than ever, more violent and selfish, when they\r\nhave obtained the last reward of all their striving, and possessed\r\nthemselves of the seat of power. It was otherwise with Cromwell. He\r\nbecame more moderate, his views more expanded, his temper milder and\r\nmore pensive. The stormy passions of the civil war were overblown, the\r\nintricate and ambiguous passages of his political course had been left\r\nbehind; and _now_, whatever may have been the errors of the past, and\r\nhowever his own ambition or rashness may have led him to it, he occupied\r\na position which he might say with truth he held for his country's good.\r\nForsake it he could not. Repose in it he could not. A man of religious\r\nbreeding, of strong conscientiousness, though tainted with superstition,\r\nhe could not but feel the great responsibility of that position. A\r\nvulgar usurper is found at this era of his career to sink into the\r\nvoluptuary, or else to vent his dissatisfied humour in acts of cruelty\r\nand oppression. Cromwell must govern, and govern to his best. The\r\nrestless and ardent spirit that had ever prompted him onwards and\r\nupwards, and which had carried him to that high place, was now upon the\r\nwane. It had borne him to that giddy pinnacle, and threatened to leave\r\nhim there. Men were now aiming at his life; the assassin was abroad;\r\none-half the world was execrating him; we doubt not that he spoke with\r\nsincerity when he said, that \"he would gladly live under any woodside,\r\nand keep a flock of sheep.\" He would gladly lay down his burden, but he\r\ncannot; can lay it down only in the grave. The sere and yellow leaf is\r\nfalling on the shelterless head of the royal Puritan. The asperity of\r\nhis earlier character is gone, the acrimony of many of his prejudices\r\nhas, in his long and wide intercourse with mankind, abated; his great\r\nduties have taught him moderation of many kinds; there remains of the\r\nfiery sectarian, who so hastily \"turned the buckle of his girdle behind\r\nhim,\" little more than his firmness and conscientiousness: his firmness\r\nthat, as he truly said, \"could be bold with men;\" his conscientiousness,\r\nwhich made the power he attained by that boldness, a burden and a heavy\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\"We have not been now four years and upwards in this government,\" says\r\nthe Protector, in one of his speeches, \"to be totally ignorant of what\r\nthings may be of the greatest concernment to us.\" No; this man has not\r\nbeen an idle scholar. Since the Lord General took the reins of civil\r\ngovernment, and became Lord Protector, he has thought and learned much\r\nof statemanship. But as a statesman, he is still first of all the\r\nPuritan. It is worth while to observe how his foreign policy, which has\r\nbeen justly admired, took its turn and direction from his religious\r\nfeelings. He made alliances with the Protestant powers of the north, and\r\nassumed a firm attitude of hostility towards Spain--and reasons of state\r\nmay have had some sway in determining him to these measures; but his\r\ngreat motive for hostility with Spain was, that she stood \"at the head\r\nof the antichristian interest\"--\"was described in the Scriptures to be\r\npapal and antichristian.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, truly your great enemy is the Spaniard. He is a natural enemy. He\r\nis naturally so throughout, by reason of that enmity that is in him\r\nagainst whatever is of God.... Your enemy, as I tell you, naturally, by\r\nthat antipathy which is in him,--and also providentially, (that is, by\r\nspecial ordering of Providence.) An enmity is put in him by God. 'I will\r\nput an enmity between thy seed and her seed,' which goes but for little\r\namong statesmen, but is more considerable than all things. And he that\r\nconsiders not such natural enmity, the _providential_ enmity as well as\r\nthe _accidental_, I think he is not well acquainted with the Scripture,\r\nand the things of God,\"--(_Speech_ 5.)\r\n\r\nIn fine, we see in Cromwell, every where and throughout, the genuine,\r\nfervid Puritan--the Puritan general, the Puritan statesman. He was a\r\nman, and, therefore, doubtless ambitious; he rose through a scene of\r\ncivil as well as military contest, and, doubtless, was not unacquainted\r\nwith dissimulation; but if we would describe him briefly, it is as the\r\nGREAT PURITAN that he must, ever be remembered in history.\r\n\r\nIn parting company with the editor of these letters and speeches, we\r\nfeel that we have not done justice to the editorial industry and\r\nresearch which these volumes display. Our space would not permit it. For\r\nthe same reason we have been unable to quote several instances of vivid\r\nnarrative, which we had hoped to transfer to our own pages. And as to\r\nour main quarrel with him--this outrageous adoption of Puritanical bile\r\nand superstition,--we have been haunted all along by a suspicion we have\r\noccasionally expressed, that the man _cannot_ be in earnest. He could\r\nnot have been so abandoned by his common sense. He has been so\r\naccustomed to mingle sport, and buffoonery, and all sorts of wilful\r\nextravagance, with his most serious mood, that he perhaps does not know\r\nhimself when, and how far, he is in earnest. In turning over the leaves\r\nof his work, we light, towards the end of the second volume, upon the\r\nfollowing passage, which may, _perhaps_, explain the temper of the\r\nwriter, when he is abetting and encouraging his fanatical heroes. He is\r\nuttering some sarcasms upon the poor \"art of speech.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no sacredness, then, any longer in the miraculous tongue of\r\nman? Is his head become a wretched cracked pitcher, on which you jingle\r\nto frighten crows, and makes bees hive? He fills me with terror, this\r\ntwo-legged rhetorical phantasm! I could long for an Oliver without\r\nrhetoric at all. I could long for a Mahomet, whose persuasive eloquence,\r\nwith wild-flashing heart and scimiter, is, 'Wretched moral, give up\r\nthat; or by the Eternal, thy maker and mine, I will kill thee! Thou\r\nblasphemous scandalous misbirth of Nature, is not even _that_ the\r\nkindest thing I can do for thee, if thou repent not, and alter in the\r\nname of Allah?'\"\r\n\r\nTo this sort of satirical humour--to \"the truth of a song,\"--not\r\nDryasdust himself would call upon him to swear. And may not all his\r\nrhapsodies upon his \"sword-in-hand\" Puritans be little more than an\r\namplification of this one passage? And, if we insist upon it, that a\r\nreform by the pen, or even by speech-making, is better than one by pike\r\nand musket--if we should suggest that matters of civil government are\r\nbetter decided by civil and political reasoning than by metaphorical\r\ntexts of Scripture, interpreted by prejudice and passion--if we contend\r\nfor such truisms as these, shall we not be in danger of occupying some\r\nsuch position as the worthy prelate whose sagacity led him to discover\r\nthat _some facts_ in Gulliver's Travels had surely been overcharged?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches, with Elucidations by Thomas\r\nCarlyle._\r\n\r\n[2] Take the following instance from the early and more moderate times\r\nof the Revolution, and wherein the most staid and sober of this class of\r\npeople is concerned. When Essex left London to march against the king,\r\nthen at Oxford, he requested the assembly of divines to keep a fast for\r\nhis success. Baillie informs us how it was celebrated. \"We spent from\r\nnine to five graciously. After Dr Twisse had begun with a brief prayer,\r\nMr Marshall prayed large two hours, most divinely confessing the sins of\r\nthe members of the assembly in a wonderful, pathetic, and prudent way.\r\nAfter Mr Arrowsmith preached an hour, then a psalm; thereafter Mr Vines\r\nprayed near two hours, and Mr Palmer preached an hour, and Mr. Seaman\r\nprayed near two hours, then a psalm; after Mr Henderson brought them to\r\na sweet conference of the heat confessed in the assembly, and other seen\r\nfaults to be remedied, and the conveniency to preach against all sects,\r\nespecially anabaptists and antinomians. Dr Twisse closed with a short\r\nprayer and blessing. God was so evidently in all this exercise that we\r\nexpect certainly a blessing.\"--_Baillie_, quoted from _Lingard_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYS AND LEGENDS OF THE THAMES.\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\n\r\n----On passing the little village of Erith, once one of the prettiest\r\nrustic spots in Kent, where the parson and the surgeon formed the heads\r\nof the community, and its only intelligence of the living world depended\r\non the casual arrival of a boat from the Margate Hoy in search of fresh\r\neggs for the voyage, a small house was pointed out to me, embosomed in a\r\ndell, which would have completely suited the solitary tastes of a poet\r\nweary of the world:\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, for a lodge in some vast wilderness,\r\n    Where rumour of oppression and deceit,\r\n    Of unsuccessful, or successful war,\r\n    Might never reach me more!\"\r\n\r\nFifty years ago, a weekly newspaper was the only remembrancer to either\r\nparson or doctor, of the world which they had left, and that one only\r\nsent by the member for the county, when he thought it desirable to awake\r\nthe general gratitude on the approach of a general election. The Thames\r\ncertainly might remind the village population that there were merchants\r\nand mariners among mankind; but what were those passing phantoms to\r\nthem? John the son of Thomas lived and died as Thomas the father of John\r\nhad lived and died from generation to generation. The first news of the\r\nAmerican war reached it in the firing of the Woolwich guns for peace;\r\nand the original tidings of the French Revolution, in similar rejoicings\r\nfor the Battle of Waterloo.\r\n\r\n    \"O happy ye, the happiest of your kind,\r\n    Who leave alike life's woes and joys behind!\"\r\n\r\nsays the philosophic Cowley; and with Cowley I perfectly agree.\r\n\r\nBut Erith is this scene of philosophy no more. It has now shared the\r\nmarch of mind: it has become almost a watering-place; it has a library,\r\na promenade, lodgings for gouty gentlemen, a conventicle, several\r\nvigorous politicians, three doctors, and, most fatal of all, four\r\nsteam-boat arrivals every day. Solitude has fled, and meditation is no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nBut, to my story. In that lonely house, lived for several years, in the\r\nbeginning of the century, a singular character, of whom nothing more was\r\nknown, than that he had come from some distant place of abode; that he\r\nnever received a letter; and that he never hunted, shot, or fished with\r\nthe squiredom of the country. He was of large form, loud voice, had a\r\nsullen look, and no trust in her Majesty's ministers for the time being.\r\nAt length, on some occasion of peculiar public excitement, the recluse\r\nhad gone to Gravesend, where, tempted by the impulse of the moment, he\r\nhad broken through his reserve, dashed out into a diatribe of singular\r\nfierceness, but of remarkable power, accused England of all kinds of\r\noppression to all kinds of countries, and finished his speech by a\r\nrecapitulation of all the wishes, wants, woes, and wrongs, as he called\r\nthem, of Ireland,\r\n\r\n    \"First flower of the west, and first gem of the ocean.\"\r\n\r\nWithin the next twelve hours, a pair of Bow Street officers were seen\r\ngalloping into the village in a post-chaise and four. They brought a\r\nwarrant from the Secretary of State to arrest the Irish orator, as a\r\nleader of the late Rebellion returned from transportation, on his own\r\nauthority. He was captured, and conveyed to the Tower. And this was the\r\nlast intelligence of the patriot; except that he appealed to the\r\ngovernment against all repetition of his Australian voyage, and swore\r\nthat he preferred the speedier performance of the law to the operations\r\non the Coal-mine river. A remarkable tempest, which broke all the\r\nwindows, and threw down half the chimneys of the city, a few weeks\r\nafter; was supposed by the imaginative to be connected with his\r\ndisappearance. At all events, he was heard of no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VISION.\r\n\r\n    Thunder pealed and lightning quivered,\r\n    Gusts a prison's casements shivered.\r\n    From its dungeon rose a scream,\r\n    Where, awakened by the gleam,\r\n    From his pallet rose and ran,\r\n    Wild with fear, a stalwart man.\r\n    Saw he in his tortured sleep,\r\n    Things that make the heart-veins creep?\r\n    Swept he through the world of flame,\r\n    Chased by shapes that none may name?\r\n    Still, as bars and windows clanged,\r\n    Still he roared--\"I _will_ be hanged.\"\r\n\r\n    Sleep had swept him o'er the seas,\r\n    To the drear antipodes;\r\n    There he saw a felon band,\r\n    Chains on neck, and spade in hand,\r\n    Orators, all sworn to die\r\n    In \"Old Ireland's\" cause--or fly!\r\n    Now, divorced from pike and pen,\r\n    Digging ditch, and draining fen,\r\n    Sky their ceiling, sand their bed,\r\n    Fed and flogged, and flogged and fed.\r\n    \"Operatives!\" he harangued;\r\n    \"Ere I'm banished--I'll be hanged.\"\r\n\r\n    Now, he strove to strike a light,\r\n    But, a form of giant height\r\n    Through the crashing casement sprang;\r\n    Shattered stanchions round him rang,\r\n    From his eyes a light within\r\n    Showed the blackness of his skin;\r\n    In his lips a huge cigar\r\n    Smouldered, like a dying star;\r\n    Holding to the culprit's eyes,\r\n    Writ in flame, a scroll of lies,\r\n    Champing jaws with iron fanged,\r\n    \"Friend,\" cried he, \"you _shall_ be hanged.\"\r\n\r\n    'Twixt the tempter and the rogue,\r\n    Then began the dialogue:\r\n    --\"Master--shall I rob the state?\"\r\n    \"Not, unless you'd dine off plate.\"\r\n    --\"Shall I try my hand at law?\"\r\n    \"You'll be sure to make a flaw.\"\r\n    --\"Shall I job in Parliament?\"\r\n    \"You'll be richer, cent per cent.\"\r\n    --\"Shall I truckle, or talk big?\"\r\n    \"You'll but get a judge's wig,\r\n    Blockheads may be conscience-panged,\r\n    Knaves are pensioned, but, _not_ hanged!\"\r\n\r\n    --\"Master, _must_ I then escape?\"\r\n    \"No,\" exclaimed the knowing shape,\r\n    \"You shall perish by Lynch-Law.\"\r\n    Through his skull he struck a claw,\r\n    On the tempest burst a wail,\r\n    Through the bars a serpent-tail,\r\n    Flashing like a lightning spire,\r\n    Seemed to set the cell on fire;\r\n    Far and wide was heard the clang,\r\n    Through the whirlwind as they sprang.\r\n    Many a year the sulphurous fume\r\n    Stung the nostril in that room.\r\n\r\nThe river widens, and we sweep along by the rich slopes and deep wooded\r\nvales of the Kentish shore. From time to time little pastoral villages\r\nemerge, from plantations of willows and poplars, and all water-loving\r\ntrees. Before coming to Purfleet, we had passed a noble hill, looking\r\nover a vast expanse of country, on which stands a princely\r\nmansion,--Belvedere, with its battlements glittering above groves as\r\nthick as the depths of the Black Forest. This was once the mansion of\r\nLord Eardley, one of the greatest humorists of the age,--the companion\r\nof George the Fourth, before he ceased to be a wit and became a king.\r\n\r\nHow many delightful things are lost to the world, by the world's own\r\nlaziness. Why have we not a Boswell in every city? Her majesty pays a\r\nlaureate, who writes nothing but the annual receipt for his pension. Why\r\nnot transfer the office to a Boswell? why not establish a Cabinet-dinner\r\nBoswell? a Buckingham-palace Boswell? a Windsor Boswell? with orders to\r\nmake their weekly returns of gaiety and gossipry to the Home Department;\r\nto be thence issued by instalments of anecdote, in volumes, like \"Lord\r\nCampbell's Lives of the Chancellors,\" or in columns, like the protocols\r\nof the Montpensier marriage, for the laughter of mankind?\r\n\r\nBut the report of a heavy gun, and all eyes turned to a huge shell,\r\nmaking its curve a mile above our heads, reminded us that the artillery\r\nhad a field-day as we passed Woolwich, and that there was every\r\npossibility that this vagrant messenger of destruction, might plump into\r\nour midships. The consternation on board grew, as it descended, looking\r\nbigger and blacker every instant. If it had come on board, it must have\r\ntorn us up like paper. The catastrophe would have been invaluable to the\r\njournals of the empire, at this moment of a dearth of news, enough to\r\nmake bankrupts of all the coffee-houses in London, and close every club\r\nfrom Charing Cross to Hyde Park Corner. _We_ should all have been\r\nimmortal in paragraphs without number. Coroners, surgeons, poets, and\r\nspecial juries, would have made their reputation out of _us_; and for a\r\nmonth of hot weather, we should have been a refreshing topic in the\r\nmouths of mankind. But it was otherwise decreed: the shell dropped\r\nwithin a foot of the steamer, and we were _quittes pour la peur_.\r\n\r\nI fired a poetic shot at Woolwich in return.\r\n\r\n    THE ROYAL ARSENAL.\r\n\r\n    Woolwich--Woolwich,\r\n    The Thames is thy ditch,\r\n      And stout hearts are thy fortification.\r\n    Let come who come may,\r\n    All is open as day,\r\n      Thy gates are as free as thy nation.\r\n\r\n    Let the King of the French\r\n    Build wall, or dig trench,\r\n      Though he has no more princes to marry,\r\n    _Our_ trench is the sea,\r\n    And _our_ walls are the free,\r\n      And we laugh at thy \"_grande enceinte, Paris._\"\r\n\r\n    Deep and dark on their quay,\r\n    Like lions at bay,\r\n      Stand the guns that set earth at defiance;\r\n    With mountains of ball,\r\n    Which, wherever they fall,\r\n      With their message make speedy compliance.\r\n\r\n    Along the Parade\r\n    Lies the brisk carronade,\r\n      With Wellington's joy, the twelve-pounder.\r\n    And the long sixty-eight,\r\n    Made for matters of weight,\r\n      The world has no arguments sounder.\r\n\r\n    There stands the long rocket,\r\n    That shot, from its socket,\r\n      Puts armies, pell-mell, to the rout, sir;\r\n    At Leipsic, its tail\r\n    Made Napoleon turn pale,\r\n      And sent all his _braves_ right about, sir.\r\n\r\n    And there gapes the mortar,\r\n    That seldom gives quarter,\r\n      When speaking to ship or to city;\r\n    For, although deaf and dumb,\r\n    Its tongue is a bomb--\r\n      And so, there's an end of my ditty.\r\n\r\nThe sun had now overcome the mists of the morning, and was throwing a\r\nrich lustre over the long sheets of foliage which screened, but without\r\nconcealing, a large and classic villa on the Essex side. The park\r\nreached to the water's edge, in broad vistas, green as the emerald; deer\r\nwere moving in groups over the lawn, or on standing still to gaze on the\r\nwonder of our flying ship. A few boats were slowly passing near the\r\nshore, along with the tide; the water was without a ripple,--the air was\r\nsoft and fragrant, as it flowed from grove and garden; and the whole was\r\na scene of sylvan and summer beauty. The thought suddenly shot across my\r\nmind, what a capital prize this would be, in a revolution! How\r\nhandsomely it would repay a patriot for his trouble in uprooting lords\r\nand commons! What a philosophic consummation of a life of husting\r\nharangues, and league itinerancy, it would be, to lie on the\r\ndrawing-room sofa of a mansion so perfectly Greek, railing at the\r\ntyranny of thrones, the bigotry of bishops, and the avarice of\r\naristocracies; lamenting the privations of the poor, over a table of\r\nthree courses, and drinking confusion to all monopolies in _Vin de\r\nComete!_\r\n\r\nBut, who was the present possessor? I asked the name and heard it. But,\r\nfrom the captain to the cabin-boy, not a soul could give me another\r\nsyllable of information. Like the gravedigger in Hamlet, they might\r\n\"cudgel their brains,\" but all came to the gravedigger's confession at\r\nlast,--\"Mass, I cannot tell.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, thought I, are the chances of the world. The owner of this marine\r\npalace,--of these gardens, groves, deer, and dovecotes,--cannot have\r\nless than L10,000 a-year; yet his name has never reached the auricular\r\nsensibilities of man, beyond the fence of his own park. Was he\r\nphilosopher, statesman, lawyer, orator, historian? inventor of\r\nsteam-engine, of spinning jenny, of gunpowder, or of gun-cotton? No, I\r\nsearched every cell of memory for some \"trivial fond record\" which might\r\njustify his title to a mansion and grounds fit for Sophocles, Schiller,\r\nor Shakspeare, the master of them all. I could not find, in all the\r\nrolls of the court of reminiscences, a single scrape of the pen to\r\ninform me; not so much as the commemorative smoke of a candle on the\r\nceiling of the alcove of Mnemosyne; not a vestige of the \"light\r\nfantastic toe,\" of those sylphs who treasure the flippancies of noble\r\npens, and live in the fragrance of albums, otto-perfumed. Still I was\r\ndriven to the confession, \"Mass, I cannot tell.\"\r\n\r\nI had brought a volume of poor Tom Campbell in my pocket, and had been\r\nglancing over his _chef-d'oeuvre_, \"Ye Mariners of England,\" when this\r\nstately edifice first checked my inspiration. In the wrath of my spirit\r\nI tossed the volume overboard. \"Psha!\" I involuntarily exclaimed, \"what\r\nis the use of being a genius? What is the gratitude of a country, where\r\na cotton-spinner can purchase the fee-simple of a province, while the\r\nman who spreads its fame over the world is left to gather his\r\ncontemplations over a stove in an attic, watch the visage of his\r\nlandlady, and shudder at the rise of coals!\r\n\r\n     'England, with all thy faults I love thee still.'\r\n\r\nBut it must be confessed, that thou art the most pitiful, paltry,\r\nbeggarly, blind--\" I shall say no more. Thy whole munificence, thy whole\r\nmagnanimity, thy whole generosity, to the living lights of thy sullen\r\nregion of toil, trimming, and tribulation, of the dulness of dukes and\r\nthe mountainous fortunes of pinmakers--is exactly L1200 a-year! and this\r\nto be divided among the whole generation of the witty and the wise, of\r\nthe sons and daughters of the muse,--the whole \"school of the prophets,\"\r\nthe lustres of the poetry and the science of England! L1200 a-year for\r\nthe only men of their generation who will be remembered for five minutes\r\nby the generation to come. L1200 a-year, the salary of an Excise\r\ncommissioner, of a manipulator of the penny post, of a charity\r\ninspector, of a police magistrate, of a register of cabs, of any thing\r\nand every body: and this, reduced to decimals, is to be the national\r\nprize, the luxurious provision, the brilliant prospect, the illustrious\r\ntribute of a treasury of fifty millions sterling a-year, to the whole\r\nliterature of a land which boasts of its being the intellectual leader\r\nof the world!\r\n\r\nI have found the poems of our living bards on the shores of Hudson's\r\nBay, and heard men talking of them round a stove, while the thermometer\r\noutside the window was 30 deg. below zero. I have found them in a\r\nplantain-thatched hovel on the banks of the Niger, and forgotten while I\r\nread them that the thermometer was 110 deg. in the shade. I have found them\r\nin the hands of a learned pundit on the banks of the Ganges, whom they\r\nwere seducing into dreams of dewy pastures and crystal rills. And one of\r\nthe pleasantest evenings I ever remember to have spent, was, by the help\r\nof the \"Lay of the Last Minstrel,\" as I sat at a supper of rice milk,\r\nafter a day of fire on the eastern branch of the Nile, a thousand miles\r\nabove Tourists, sheltered under the wagon of a Moorish ambassador from\r\nSultaun Abderahman to the monarch of Gondar. \"England!\" exclaimed this\r\nebony-visaged worshipper of the Beaux Arts, as he displayed the volume\r\nbefore me. It was the only civilised word in his vocabulary. But I felt\r\nthe compliment with patriotic fervency, and in spirit thanked the bard\r\nfor the barbarian's acknowledgment of my poetic and penurious country.\r\n\r\nI have not done with the theme yet. On returning from the equator, I saw\r\nCampbell's funeral. Westminster Abbey was a mob of dukes, statesmen,\r\nprivy-councillors, and men of countless acres. Poor Tom's whole life had\r\nbeen thankless toil; wasting in meagre industry the powers which ought\r\nto have been cherished by his country for purposes of national honour.\r\nSuch is always the course of things. The very stones of Burns' pillars\r\nwould have made the great poet happy for life, if their price had been\r\ngiven to him to cheer his melancholy fireside. Why has the poetic spirit\r\nof England folded its wings, and been content to abandon its brilliant\r\nregion to the butterflies of albums, but that the spirit of England has\r\nsuffered itself to be fettered by the red tape of a peddling parsimony?\r\nShould we have had a Shakspeare without the smiles of an Elizabeth, and\r\nthe generosity of a Southampton? No. He would have split his pen after\r\nhis first tragedy; have thrown his ink-stand into the Thames; have taken\r\nthe carrier's cart to Stratford, and there finished his days in writing\r\nepitaphs in the churchyard, laughing at Sir Thomas Lucy, and bequeathing\r\ndeathless scoffs, to the beggary of mankind.\r\n\r\nI was growing into what the dramatists call a \"towering passion,\" and\r\nmeditating general reforms of Civil Lists, Chancellors of the Exchequer,\r\nand Lord Chamberlains, when my attention was turned to a very animated\r\nscene going on between a pair who seemed perfectly unconscious of all\r\nthe external creation. One of the parties was a showy-looking fellow,\r\nwith the mingled expression of _roueism_ and half-pay, which is so\r\nfrequent and so unmistakeable in the neighbourhood of St James's. The\r\nlady was a calm and composed personage, whom, on a second glance, I\r\nremembered to have seen wherever the world could bow down to the fair\r\npossessor of countless \"consols.\" But the passion for a handsome\r\nmansion, a handsome stud, and a handsome rental, is indefatigable, and\r\nthe ex-staff man poured his adorations into her ear with all the glow of\r\na suitor ten thousand pounds worse than nothing.\r\n\r\nPoesy! sweetest of all the maids of Parnassus! it is thou that givest\r\nthy votary power to read the soul: it is thou that canst translate the\r\nglance into a speech, and give eloquence to the clasp of a hand. It is\r\nthou alone to whom the world is indebted for this _true_ version of the\r\npleadings of the Guardsman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRUE LOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Exquisite Miss Millionaire!\r\n    Hear a lover's genuine prayer:\r\n    Let the world adore your charms,\r\n    Swan-like neck, or snowy arms,\r\n    Rosy smile, or dazzling glance,\r\n    Making all our bosoms dance;\r\n    For your purse alone I care,\r\n    Exquisite Miss Millionaire!\r\n    Ringlets blackest of the black,\r\n    Ivory shoulders, Grecian back,\r\n    Tresses so divinely twined,\r\n    That we long to be the wind,\r\n    Waiting till the lady's face\r\n    Turns, to give the _coup de grace_.\r\n    All those spells to _me_ are air.\r\n    Truth is truth, Miss Millionaire.\r\n\r\n    Let them talk of finger-tips,\r\n    Pearly teeth, or coral lips,\r\n    Cheeks the morning rose that mock,\r\n    _Still_ there _is_ a charm in Stock!\r\n    Solid mortgage, five per cent,\r\n    Freehold with \"improving\" rent,\r\n    Russia bond, and railroad share,\r\n    Steal _my_ soul, Miss Millionaire.\r\n\r\n    Let your rhymers (all are crackt)\r\n    Rave of cloud or cataract;\r\n    On the Rhine, or Rhone, or Arve,\r\n    Let romancers stroll and starve.\r\n    Cupid loves a gilded cage,\r\n    (Let _me_ choose your equipage,)\r\n    Passion pants for Portman Square,\r\n    (Be but mine,) Miss Millionaire.\r\n\r\n    There you'll lead a London life,\r\n    More a goddess than a wife;\r\n    Fifty thousand pounds a-year\r\n    Making our expenses clear;\r\n    Giving, once a-week, a _fete_,\r\n    Simply to display our plate.\r\n    Never earth saw such a pair,\r\n    Exquisite Miss Millionaire!\r\n\r\nBut a steeple starts up from its green thickets; not one of the hideous\r\nobjects which the architects of our district churches perpetrate, to\r\npuzzle the passer-by as to the purpose of its being,--whether a brewer's\r\nchimney, or a shot-tower,--a perch for city pigeons, or a standing\r\nburlesque on the builders of the nineteenth age of the fine arts in\r\nEngland. This steeple is an old grey turret, ivy-mantled, modest, and\r\nwith that look of venerable age which instinctively makes us feel, that\r\nit has witnessed memorable things in its time.\r\n\r\nAnd it _has_ witnessed them. On the slope of the hill above this church\r\nonce waved the banners of a king, and the opposing banners of his\r\nnobles: the one receiving the lesson, that kings have duties as well as\r\ntheir subjects; and the others enforcing the lesson by the sight of\r\nlines and columns of the stout bowmen and billmen of the Norman\r\nchivalry.--On this spot, just this day six hundred and thirty years ago,\r\nwas held the grand conference between John and the Barons.\r\n\r\nFurther inland, but rising on the view, is Swainscomb, the hill on which\r\nthe Danish armies encamped, in their pirate rovings of the British seas,\r\nand their invasions of the Thames.\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast between the green landscape of this moment, and the camp\r\nof Sweno. All before me was the luxury of cultivation, the yellowing\r\ncrop, the grazing cattle, the cottage smoke curling slowly upward on the\r\nback-ground of noble beech, ash, and sycamore. On the summit, the sun\r\ngleamed on a rectory house, half buried in roses, where the most learned\r\nof our Orientalists perused the Koran in the peace of a Mahometan\r\nparadise, and doubtless saw, on the dancing waters of the mighty river\r\nat his feet, perpetual visions of houris.\r\n\r\nYet those pastures once echoed with the barbarian cries of the Cimbric\r\nwarriors; tents of seal-skin and white bear fur covered the hill; the\r\nsmokes of savage feasting and Scandinavian sacrifice clouded the skies;\r\nand on the summit, surrounded by iron guards and spectral-looking\r\npriests, stood the magic standard of the north, the image of the Raven,\r\nwhich flapped its wings on the coming of battle, and gave the oracular\r\ncry of victory.\r\n\r\nBut, what sounds of harmony sweep along the water! I see a range of\r\nshowy figures on the shore; it is a whole brass band, seducing us, in\r\nthe style of the syrens of old, to bring our ship to an anchor, and\r\nhazard the enchantments of the most delicious of tea-gardens.--We are\r\nwithin a hundred yards of the pier of Rosherville.\r\n\r\nWithin five minutes, we might be roaming through this paradise of the\r\nThames, climbing rustic slopes carpeted with flowers, or gazing at a\r\nmenagerie, where the monkeys bound, chatter, and take apples out of your\r\nhand; or sipping coffee of the most fragrant growth, or dancing the\r\npolka under alcoves of painted canvass, large enough to manoeuvre a\r\nbrigade of the Horse-guards. By day the scene is romantic, but by night\r\nit is magical. By day the stranger roams through labyrinths of exotic\r\nvegetation, but by night he is enchanted with invisible music, dazzled\r\nwith fireworks, and goes to his pillow to dream of the Arabian Nights.\r\nHonour to the name of Jeremiah Rosher, the discoverer of the\r\n\"capabilities\" of this Garden of the Hesperides. He found it a lime\r\nquarry, and made it a bower of Armida. If, as the great moralist said,\r\n\"the man who makes two blades of grass grow where but one grew before,\r\nis a benefactor to mankind,\" what honours should be paid to the genius,\r\nwhich substituted human beings for lime-burners, and made the elite of\r\nthe east end of the mighty metropolis dance by thousands, where nothing\r\nbut the top of a thistle ever danced before. There have been more \"first\r\naffections\" awakened in the rambles through the shades of Rosherville\r\nthan in fifty Almacks, and five hundred times more matches in\r\nconsequence, than ever took refuge in Gretna; and all this--for a\r\nshilling!\r\n\r\nAs we neared the pier, I observed a small but elegant yacht, lying to;\r\nwith several groups of dark-featured and cloak-covered men listening,\r\nwith all the eagerness of foreign gesture, to the brazen harmony. My\r\nItalian _compagnon de voyage_, instantly bounded from his seat, ran to\r\nthe ship's side, and held a rapid dialogue with the crew of the little\r\nvessel. They were just from Rome, and were bringing over the newly\r\nappointed Archbishop from the Vatican! The novelty of the voyage did not\r\nseem to agree with the pleasurable faculties of those sons of \"Bella\r\nItalia,\" for nothing could be conceived more deplorable than their\r\nphysiognomies.\r\n\r\nThe scene reminded me of one which I had witnessed at Naples, on the\r\narrival of the first steam-boat from Rome, conveying the Cardinal Legate\r\nto the Court of his Majesty of the Two Sicilies.\r\n\r\nI disdain all the formalities of poetry. Let others prepare their\r\nparchment-bound portfolios, throw their visages into the _penseroso_,\r\nfling their curls back from their brows, unbutton their shirt-collars,\r\nand, thus Byronised, begin. To _me_ all times and places are the\r\nsame.--The inspiration rushes on me, and I pour out my \"unpremeditated\r\nsong\" in the original rapture of Bardism!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARDINAL'S VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have seen some queer things,\r\n    Both in people and kings,\r\n        Since first I began as a dreamer;\r\n    But I ne'er thought to hear\r\n    Any thing half so queer\r\n        As a Cardinal's trip in a steamer.\r\n\r\n    I once saw a Rabbi,\r\n    The prince of the shabby,\r\n        In a gale of wind playing the screamer,\r\n    Till we plumped him o'erboard,\r\n    Towed along by a cord,\r\n        For a bath at the tail of the steamer.\r\n\r\n    'Tis true, the Chinese\r\n    Looked as black as their teas,\r\n        When battered by brave Sir John Bremer:\r\n    But John Chinaman's slaughter\r\n    Was all milk and water,\r\n        To the havoc on board of the steamer.\r\n\r\n    On a coil of the cable,\r\n    Right under the table,\r\n        With the glass at 500 of Reaumur,\r\n    Busy \"making his soul,\"\r\n    As he felt every roll,\r\n        Lay his Highness, on board of the steamer.\r\n\r\n    Around him ten chaplains,\r\n    And none of them saplings,\r\n        Lay pale as a quarantine streamer.\r\n    With six dozen of monks,\r\n    All as helpless as trunks,\r\n        All rolling about in the steamer.\r\n\r\n    As she steered down the Tiber,\r\n    It shook every fibre\r\n        Of the conclave from forehead to _femur_;\r\n    But, 'twas when in her glee,\r\n    She got sight of the sea,\r\n        That she showed them the tricks of the steamer.\r\n\r\n    At Civita Vecchia,\r\n    Oh, mie orecchie!\r\n        What howls called the Saints to redeem her.\r\n    But she darted along\r\n    Like a stone from a thong,\r\n        In the style of a true British steamer.\r\n\r\n    She now ruled the roast,\r\n    As she sprang from the coast,\r\n        Through such surges no buckets could teem her:\r\n    The Lipari Isles\r\n    Got but very few smiles\r\n        From the brethren on board of the steamer.\r\n\r\n    \"As sure as we're born,\r\n    We'll ne'er see Leghorn.\"\r\n        \"Peccavi!\" cried out every schemer:\r\n    The whole of the friars.\r\n    In that court were \"criers,\"\r\n        While thundered the wheels of the steamer.\r\n\r\n    I'd not stand in their shoes,\r\n    As they passed Syracuse,\r\n        Where thy frigate lay moored, Captain Seymour:\r\n    At the top of their throats\r\n    Yelling out for thy boats,\r\n        While teeth to the wind went the steamer.\r\n\r\n    As they swept by Messina--\r\n    Thy birth-place, Christina!--\r\n        Old Etna was scarce such a beamer:\r\n    In vain they cried--\"Stop!\"\r\n    With a blaze at her top,\r\n        Like a pillar of flame rushed the steamer.\r\n\r\n    She bounced by Charybdis,\r\n    With limestone which ribb'd is;\r\n        A touch from a pebble might seam her;\r\n    Made a curtsey to Scylla,\r\n    As the Turks say, \"Bismillah,\"\r\n        'Twas a very close shave for the steamer.\r\n\r\n    But the surges grew brown,\r\n    And the night hurried down,\r\n        And they saw in each flash a death-gleamer;\r\n    While the peals from the clouds,\r\n    And the wind in the shrouds,\r\n        Made them all very sick of the steamer.\r\n\r\n    When they made Capri's lights\r\n    It redoubled their frights,\r\n        And the friars all bellowed--\"Tenemur!\"\r\n    One and all made confessions,\r\n    (E'en popes have transgressions,)\r\n        There was some heavy work in the steamer.\r\n\r\n    But they soon smelt the apples\r\n    And fish-shops of Naples,\r\n        And the cargo began to esteem her--\r\n    \"No witch in a sieve,\r\n    They could ever believe,\r\n        Had sailed half so fast as the steamer.\"\r\n\r\n    Could my pen give a sketch\r\n    Of each wo-begone wretch,\r\n        Like Gilray, H. B., or old Damer,\r\n    You should have the whole troop\r\n    That lay stretched on the poop,\r\n        As up by the mole dashed the steamer.\r\n\r\n    Were I Guizot, or Florian,\r\n    Or \"Oxford Historian,\"\r\n        Or \"Orator\" like Dr Cremer,\r\n    In my grand paragraphs,\r\n    You should have all the laughs\r\n        Of the mob as they rushed from the steamer!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS ON THE TRUTHS CONTAINED IN POPULAR SUPERSTITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--VAMPYRISM.\r\n\r\nDear Archy,--In acknowledging my former letter, you express an eager\r\ndesire to learn, as you phrase it, \"all about vampyrs, if there ever\r\nwere such things.\" I will not delay satisfying your curiosity, wondering\r\nonly how my friend, your late tutor, Mr H., should have left you in a\r\nstate of uncertainty upon a point on which, in my time, schoolboys many\r\nyears your juniors had fully made up their minds.\r\n\r\n\"Were there ever such things as vampyrs?\" _tantamne rem tam\r\nnegligenter?_ I turn to the learned pages of Horst for a luminous and\r\nprecise definition of the destructive and mysterious beings, whose\r\nexistence you have ventured to consider problematical.\r\n\r\n\"A vampyr is a dead body, which continues to live in the grave, which it\r\nleaves, however, by night, for the purpose of sucking the blood of the\r\nliving, whereby it is nourished, and preserved in good condition,\r\ninstead of becoming decomposed like other dead bodies.\"\r\n\r\nUpon my word, you really deserve--Since Mr George Combe has clearly\r\nshown in his admirable work \"On the Constitution of Man, and its\r\nadaptation to the world around him,\" that ignorance is a statutable\r\ncrime before Nature, and punishable, and punished by the laws of\r\nProvidence,--you deserve, I say, unless you contrive to make Mr H. your\r\nsubstitute, which I think would be just, yourself to be the subject of\r\nthe nocturnal visit of a vampyr. Your scepticism will abate pretty\r\nconsiderably, when you see him stealthily entering your room, yet are\r\npowerless under the fascination of his fixed and leaden eye--when you\r\nare conscious, as you lie motionless with terror, of his nearer and\r\nnearer approach,--when you feel his face, fresh with the smell of the\r\ngrave, bent over your throat, while his keen teeth make a fine incision\r\nin your jugular, preparatively to his commencing his plain, but\r\nnutritive repast.\r\n\r\nYou would look a little paler the next morning, but that would be all\r\nfor the moment; for Fischer informs us, that the bite of a vampyr leaves\r\nin general no mark upon the person. But he fearfully adds, \"it (the\r\nbite) is nevertheless speedily fatal, unless the bitten person protect\r\nhimself by eating some of the earth from the grave of the vampyr, and\r\nsmearing himself with his blood.\" Unfortunately, indeed, these measures\r\nare only of temporary use. Fischer adds, \"if through these precautions\r\nthe life of the victim be prolonged for a period, sooner or later he\r\nends with becoming a vampyr himself; that is to say, he dies, and is\r\nburied, but continues to lead a vampyr life in the grave, nourishing\r\nhimself by infecting others, and promiscuously propagating vampyrism.\"\r\n\r\nNow this is no romancer's dream. It is a succinct account of a\r\nsuperstition, which to this day survives in the east of Europe, where\r\nlittle more than a century ago it was frightfully prevalent. At that\r\nepoch, vampyrism spread like, an epidemic pestilence through Servia and\r\nWallachia, causing innumerable deaths, and disturbing all the land with\r\napprehension of the mysterious visitation, against which no one felt his\r\nlife secure.\r\n\r\nThis is something like a good solid practical popular delusion. Do I\r\nbelieve it?--to be sure I do; the facts are matter of history. The\r\npeople died like sheep, and the cause and method of their dying was, in\r\ntheir belief, what has just been stated. You suppose, then, they died,\r\nfrightened out of their lives; as men have died, whose pardon has been\r\nproclaimed when their necks were already on the block, of the belief\r\nthat they were going to die? Well, if that were all, the subject would\r\nbe worth examining; but there is more in it than that, as the following\r\no'er true tale will convince you, the essential parts of which are\r\nattested by perfect documentary evidence.\r\n\r\nIt was in the spring of 1727 that there returned from the Levant to the\r\nvillage of Meduegna, near Belgrade, one Arnod Paole, who, in a few years\r\nof military service and varied adventure, had amassed enough to purchase\r\nhim a cottage, and an acre or two of land in his native place, where he\r\ngave out he meant to pass the remainder of his days. He kept his word.\r\nArnod had yet scarcely reached the prime of manhood; and though he must\r\nhave encountered the rough, as well as the smooth of life, and have\r\nmingled with many a wild and reckless companion, yet his natural good\r\ndisposition, and honest principle, had preserved him unscathed amid the\r\nscenes he had passed through. At all events, such were the thoughts\r\nexpressed by his neighbours, as they discussed his return and settlement\r\namong them in the stube of the village Hof. Nor did the frank and open\r\ncountenance of Arnod, his obliging habits, and steady conduct, argue\r\ntheir judgment incorrect. Nevertheless, there was something\r\noccasionally, noticeable in his ways, a look and tone that betrayed\r\ninward inquietude. Often would he refuse to join his friends, or on some\r\nsudden plea abruptly quit their society. And he still more\r\nunaccountably, and as it seemed systematically, avoided meeting his\r\npretty neighbour, Nina, whose father occupied the next tenement to his\r\nown. At the age of seventeen, Nina was as charming a picture as you\r\ncould have seen, of youth, cheerfulness, innocence, and confidence in\r\nall the world. You could not look into her limpid eyes, which steadily\r\nreturned your gaze, without seeing to the bottom of the pure and\r\ntransparent spring of her thoughts. Then why did Arnod shrink from\r\nmeeting her? He was young, had a little property, had health and\r\nindustry, and he had told his friends he had formed no ties in other\r\nlands. Why, then, did he avoid the fascination of the pretty Nina, who\r\nseemed a being made to chase from any brow the clouds of gathering care?\r\nBut he did so. Yet less and less resolutely; for he felt the charm of\r\nher presence; who could have done otherwise? and how could he at last\r\nresist--he didn't--the impulse of his fondness for the innocent girl who\r\noften sought to cheer his fits of depression?\r\n\r\nAnd they were to be united; were betrothed; yet still an anxious gloom\r\nwould fitfully overcast his countenance even in the sunshine of those\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, dear Arnod, that makes you sad? it cannot be on my account,\r\nI know; for you were sad before you ever noticed me; and that I think,\"\r\nand you should have seen the deepening rose upon her cheek, as she\r\nadded, \"surely first made me notice you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nina,\" he answered, \"I have done, I fear, a great wrong in trying to\r\ngain your affections. Nina, I have a fixed impression that I shall not\r\nlive; yet, knowing this, I have selfishly made my existence necessary to\r\nyour happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"How strangely you talk, dear Arnod! Who in the village is stronger and\r\nhealthier than you? You feared no danger when you were a soldier; what\r\ndanger do you fear as a villager of Meduegna?\"\r\n\r\n\"It haunts me, Nina.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Arnod, you were sad before you thought of loving me. Did you then\r\nfear to die?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Nina, it is something worse than death:\" and his vigorous frame\r\nshook with agony.\r\n\r\n\"Arnod, I conjure you, tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was in Cossova this fate befel me. Here we have hitherto escaped the\r\nterrible scourge. But there they died, and the dead visited the living.\r\nI experienced a first frightful visitation, and I fled, but not till I\r\nhad sought his grave, and exacted the dread expiation from the vampyr.\"\r\n\r\nNina uttered a piercing cry, and fell senseless. Afterwards, they found\r\na consolation in the length of time, now months, that had elapsed, since\r\nArnod had left Cossova, during which no fearful visitant had again\r\napproached him; and they fondly began to hope _that_ gave them security.\r\nFor the poor girl well knew from many a village tale the danger to which\r\nArnod had been exposed.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange world. The ills we fear often never befall us: the blows\r\nthat reach us are for the most part unforeseen ones. One day, about a\r\nweek after this conversation, Arnod missed his footing and fell from the\r\ntop of his loaded hay-wagon. He was picked up stunned and insensible.\r\nThey carried him home; where, after lingering some hours, he died; was\r\nburied; but _not_ forgotten.\r\n\r\nTwenty or thirty days after his decease, says the perfectly\r\nauthenticated report of these transactions, several in the neighbourhood\r\nmade complaints that they had been haunted by the deceased Arnod; and\r\nfour of the number (among whom, there being nothing in the report to the\r\ncontrary, I am afraid we may include poor Nina) died. To put a term to\r\nthis fearful evil, the villagers were advised by their Heyduke, who had\r\nhad before some experience in such matters, to disinter the body of\r\nArnod Paole. This step was accordingly taken _forty days after his\r\nburial_.\r\n\r\n\"The body,\" says the report, \"was found in a perfectly fresh state, with\r\nno sign of decomposition. Fresh blood had recently escaped from its\r\nmouth, with which its shirt was wet. The skin (the epidermis, no doubt)\r\nhad separated together with the nails, and there were new skin and nails\r\nunderneath. As it was perfectly clear from these signs that he was a\r\nvampyr, conformably to the use established in such cases, they drove a\r\nstake through his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Whereupon he gave an audible groan, and a quantity of blood flowed from\r\nhim. The same day his body was burned to ashes, which were returned to\r\nthe grave.\"\r\n\r\nThe authorities further staked and burned the bodies of the four others,\r\nwho were supposed to have been infected by Arnod: but no mention is\r\nmade of the condition in which they were found.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of this decisive, measure did not, however, entirely\r\nextinguish the evil, which continued still to hang about the village.\r\nAbout five years afterwards it had again become rife and very prevalent,\r\nand many again died of it. Whereupon the authorities determined to make\r\na general clearance of the vampyrs in the churchyard of Meduegna, and\r\nfor that purpose they had all the graves to which suspicion was\r\ndirected, opened, and their contents dealt with conformably to the state\r\nin which they were found, of which the following is the medical report,\r\nhere and there _abridged_ only:--\r\n\r\n1. A woman of the name of Stana, 20 years of age, who had died 3 months\r\nbefore of a 3 days' illness following her confinement. She had before\r\nher death avowed that she had anointed herself with the blood of a\r\nvampyr, to liberate herself from his persecution. Nevertheless she, as\r\nwell as her infant, whose body through careless interment had been\r\nhalf-eaten by dogs, both had died. Her body was entirely free from\r\ndecomposition. On opening it, the chest was found full of recently\r\neffused blood. The heart and blood-vessels contained no coagulated\r\nblood, and the bowels had exactly the appearances of sound health. The\r\nskin and nails of the hands and feet were loose and came off, but\r\nunderneath lay new skin and nails.\r\n\r\n2. A woman of the name of Miliza, who had died at the end of a 3 months'\r\nillness. The body had been buried 90 and odd days. In the chest was\r\nliquid blood. The viscera were as in the former instance. The body was\r\ndeclared by the Heydukes who recognised it, to be in better condition\r\nand fatter than it had been in the woman's legitimate lifetime.\r\n\r\n3. The body of a child of 8 years old, that had likewise been buried 90\r\ndays; it was in the vampyr condition.\r\n\r\n4. The son of a Heyduke, named Milloc 16 years old. The body had lain in\r\nthe grave 9 weeks. He had died after 3 days' indisposition, and was in\r\nthe condition of a vampyr.\r\n\r\n5. Joachim, likewise a Heyduke's son, 17 years old. He had died after a\r\n3 days' illness; had been buried 8 weeks and 4 days; was found in the\r\nvampyr state.\r\n\r\n6. A woman of the name of Rusha, who had died of an illness of 10 days'\r\nduration, and had been buried 6 weeks, in whom likewise fresh blood was\r\nfound in the chest.\r\n\r\n[The reader will understand, that to see blood in the chest it is first\r\nnecessary to _cut_ the chest open.]\r\n\r\n7. The body of a girl of 10 years of age, who had died 2 months before.\r\nIt was likewise in the vampyr state, perfectly undecomposed, with blood\r\nin the chest.\r\n\r\n8. The body of the wife of one Hadnuck, buried 7 weeks before; and that\r\nof her infant, 8 weeks old, buried only 21 days. They were both in a\r\nstate of decomposition, though buried in the same ground, and closely\r\nadjoining the others.\r\n\r\n9. A servant of the Heyduke of the place, by name Rhade, 23 years old;\r\nhe had died after an illness of 3 months' duration, and the body had\r\nbeen buried 5 weeks. It was in a state of decomposition.\r\n\r\n10. The body of the Heyduke Stanco, 60 years of age, who had died six\r\nweeks before: there was much blood and other fluid in the chest and\r\nabdomen, and the body was in the vampyr condition.\r\n\r\n11. Milloc, a Heyduke, 25 years old. The body had been in the earth 6\r\nweeks. It was in the perfect vampyr condition.\r\n\r\n12. Stanjoika, the wife of a Heyduke, 20 years old; had died after an\r\nillness of three days, and had been buried 18 days. The countenance was\r\nflorid, and of a high colour. There was blood in the chest and in the\r\nheart. The viscera were perfectly sound. The skin remarkably fresh.\r\n\r\nThe document which gives these particulars is signed by three regimental\r\nsurgeons, and formally countersigned by the lieutenant-colonel and a\r\nsub-lieutenant, it bears the date of June 7, 1732, Meduegna near\r\nBelgrade. No doubt can be entertained of its authenticity, nor of its\r\n_general_ fidelity; the less so, that it does not stand alone, but is\r\nsupported by heaps of parallel evidence, only less rigorously\r\nverifiable. It appears to me to establish beyond a question, that,\r\nwhere the fear and belief of vampyrism is prevailing, and there occur\r\nseveral deaths after short illnesses, the bodies, when disinterred,\r\nweeks after burial, present the appearance of corpses, from which life\r\nhas only recently departed.\r\n\r\nWhat inference shall we draw from this fact?--that vampyrism is true in\r\nthe popular sense, and that these fresh-looking and well-conditioned\r\ncorpses had some mysterious way of preternaturally nourishing\r\nthemselves? That would be to adopt, not to solve the superstition. Let\r\nus content ourselves for the present with a notion less monstrous, but\r\nstill startling enough: That the bodies, which were found in the\r\nso-called vampyr state, instead of being in a new and mystical\r\ncondition, were simply alive in the common way; that, in short, they\r\nwere the bodies of persons who had been buried alive; and whose life was\r\nonly extinguished by the ignorance and barbarity of those who\r\ndisinterred them. In the following sketch of a similar scene to that\r\nabove described, the truth of this inference comes out with terrific\r\nforce and vividness.\r\n\r\nErasmus Francisi, in his remarks upon the description of the Archdukedom\r\nof Krain, by Valvasor, speaks of a man of the name of Grando, in the\r\ndistrict of Kring, who died, was buried, and became a vampyr, and as\r\nsuch was exhumed for the purpose of having a stake thrust through him.\r\n\r\n\"When they opened his grave, after he had been long buried, his face was\r\nfound with a colour, and his features made natural sorts of movements,\r\nas if the dead man smiled. He even opened his mouth, as if he would\r\ninhale fresh air. They held the crucifix before him, and called in a\r\nloud voice, 'See, this is Jesus Christ who redeemed your soul from hell,\r\nand died for you.' After the sound had acted on his organs of hearing,\r\nand he had connected, perhaps, some ideas with it, tears began to flow\r\nfrom the dead man's eyes. Finally, when, after a short prayer for his\r\npoor soul, they proceeded to hack off his head, the corpse uttered a\r\nscreech, and turned and rolled just as if it had been alive, and the\r\ngrave was full of blood.\"\r\n\r\nAlive, then, the bodies surely were. And it is from this position, as a\r\nstarting point, that we must follow and unravel the whole mystery, _if\r\nwe dare_.\r\n\r\nNot that there is any particular virulence in this superstition, but\r\nthat all superstitions are awkward things to deal with. They have their\r\nown laws, and run through definite stages, but always menace those who\r\nmeddle with them. A superstition waxes and flourishes--that is its first\r\nstage; it then wanes in public opinion, is discredited, and is declared\r\nobsolete; that is stage the second. Eventually comes more enlightenment;\r\nits wonders are again admitted, but explained; the false in it separated\r\nfrom the true; this is its third and last period. And it may be\r\nremarked, that society is never safe against the reproduction of a\r\nsuperstition, till it has gone through this third stage (analogous to\r\nthe disinterment and dissection of a vampyr); till then, it is always\r\ncapable of \"walking\" again. But, which is singular, to the end the\r\noperation of explaining a superstition is unsafe, that is to say, if you\r\nstep a quarter of an inch before the sagacious nose of the public. Of\r\ncourse, if any one should attempt to explain away a flourishing\r\nsuperstition, he would encounter, not martyrdom, perhaps, any more, but\r\nthe persecution of opinion certainly, and the ban of society. But if he\r\nventures upon the same process, even with one that is already put down,\r\nhe is liable to be viewed and attacked as a credulous person, disposed\r\nto revive forgotten rubbish; for he has unwittingly affronted public\r\nopinion by asserting that to be worth examining, which society had\r\nproclaimed an error. Doubly wo to him if his explanation contain some\r\nstartling novelty! But, courage! again,--\r\n\r\nThe bodies disinterred and found in the so-called vampyr state, were\r\nthen alive.\r\n\r\nBut how could they, you ask, be alive after an interment of days or\r\nweeks? How is it possible they could lie without air, boxed up in a\r\nmanner which would certainly kill a strong and healthy person in a few\r\nminutes or hours, and yet retain their vitality? I will not bring\r\nforward as favourable cases in point, the instances of frogs and toads\r\nthat have been discovered in rocks, where they must have been encased\r\nfor years or centuries, alive: first, because, although they are true,\r\nyou might equally question these; secondly, because a human being cannot\r\ncompete in vitality with a cold-blooded reptile. I shall content myself\r\nwith falling back upon the evidence already adduced. The disinterred\r\nbodies _proved_, by their appearance, some even by their behaviour, that\r\nthey were alive; and I shall retort upon you the question, how came you\r\nnot to know that bodies could live under such circumstances a\r\nconsiderable length of time, and that many cases have transpired in\r\nwhich, totally _apart from vampyrism_, bodies have been found turned\r\nover in the coffin, through efforts made by them, when, after their\r\nburial, they had unhappily recovered consciousness?\r\n\r\nBut what, then, was the pathological condition in which these persons\r\ncontinued to exist, after they had ceased to appear alive?\r\n\r\nIt is just one of the profitable results of examining the superstition\r\nbefore us, that the above question becomes explicitly propounded, and\r\nits solution demanded of physiologists. Its solution cannot fail of\r\nbeing full of interest, but it is yet, unluckily, a desideratum, or,\r\nlike the principle which gives motion to the divining rod, as yet only\r\nindicated and partially outlined.\r\n\r\nWhat is wanted is direct scientific examination, and verification by\r\ncompetent persons, of all the phenomena the body presents in these\r\nstrange circumstances. In the absence, however, of recorded observation,\r\nlet us imagine how the thing might come about.\r\n\r\nThe series of effects surmised would not begin in the heart; analogy\r\nleads us to suppose that primary interruption of the heart's action for\r\na very brief period is fatal. Somewhere in the Indian seas, death is\r\ninflicted by a backward blow with the elbow on the region of the heart;\r\na sudden angina is produced, which is promptly fatal. Neither, upon\r\nsimilar showing, can it commence in obstructed breathing. Then the\r\ncommencement of the changes must be sought in the brain. Now it is\r\nanalogically by no means very improbable, that the functions of the\r\nnervous system admit of being brought to a complete stand-still, the\r\nwheels of the machinery locking, as it were, of a sudden, through some\r\ninfluence directly exerted upon _it_, and that this state of interrupted\r\nfunction should continue for a very considerable period, without loss of\r\npower of recovery. Nor would it be contrary to analogy that such an\r\narrest of activity in the nervous system should stop, more or less\r\ncompletely, the act of breathing and the action of the heart, without at\r\nthe same time the consequences following which result from either of\r\nthese changes, _when they are primary_. The heart, when _not acting by\r\norder_, need not be supposed to lose its contractile force and tendency.\r\nThe blood, though not moving, being in contact with living vessels, need\r\nnot coagulate. There is no physiological absurdity in supposing such a\r\ngeneral arrest of function, originating in the nervous system, and\r\ncontinuing an indefinite period without life being extinguished. If a\r\nswimmer be taken with cramp and sink, he is irretrievably dead in five\r\nminutes. But if he sink from a fit of epilepsy, he may remain a longer\r\ntime under water, yet recover. But epilepsy is a form of loss of\r\nconsciousness beginning in the nervous system--a kind of fit which may,\r\nunder certain circumstances, be thus preservative of life. So may we\r\npresume, that in the singular cases we are considering, the body is but\r\nin another and deeper fit, which suspends the vital phenomena, and\r\nreduces its vitality to that of the unincubated egg, to simple life,\r\nwithout change, without waste or renewal. The body does not putrefy,\r\nbecause it is alive; it does not waste or require nourishment, because\r\nevery action is stilled within it.\r\n\r\nBut this must be a dull subject of speculation for you, and your mind is\r\nperhaps wandering thence to more practical views. It has struck you\r\npossibly, not without an uncomfortable misgiving, that this obscure, but\r\nunpleasant event may happen to yourself, and what on earth is there to\r\nprevent _your_ being buried alive?\r\n\r\nIf you wish individually to be as safe as possible, leave by will to\r\nsome eminent surgeon, not your habitual attendant, L50, and his railway\r\nexpenses, &c., to be paid him for opening your body, when you are\r\ncertainly dead; L25 if he opens you, finds you alive, and succeeds in\r\nsewing you up, and keeping you so; L200, on the contrary, to be expended\r\nin indicting him for manslaughter if you die under his hands. I do not\r\nventure to affirm that with all these precautions you would be perfectly\r\nsafe. The eminent Vesalius, surgeon, and a favourite of the Emperor\r\nCharles V., with all his experience and knowledge, was unlucky enough to\r\nopen a Spanish nobleman by mistake, while he was yet alive. The\r\nconsequences, no doubt, were more serious than they would be now.\r\nVesalius hardly escaped the claws of the Inquisition, and died during\r\nhis expiatory pilgrimage to the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nIf, more comprehensively, you should wish to save others, as well as\r\nyourself, from this awful risk, and have a friend in the legislature,\r\nurge him, or otherwise Mr Wakley, to move for the insertion in any\r\nconvenient bill a clause to appoint in every district a qualified\r\nofficer to license burials; he had better not be a practising doctor,\r\nbut his office might embrace necroscopic inquiries for the coroner, and\r\nthe registrarship of births and deaths.\r\n\r\nIn either case, I would recommend you to offer publicly a premium of\r\nL500, to be paid at the expiration of three years, for the best treatise\r\nupon the signs of death; the same being calculated to form a useful body\r\nof instruction, as yet wanting, either for your private surgeon, or the\r\nnew officials.\r\n\r\nIn England, indeed, our decent respect for the dead, which leads us to\r\npostpone interment as long as possible, is a tolerable security against\r\nbeing buried alive. The coffin is seldom closed upon the remains, before\r\ndecomposition has already commenced. _That_ is death's certain seal;\r\nnor, in the present state of our knowledge, special cases of course\r\nexcepted, is it right to consider life surely extinct, till the impress\r\nof that seal is perceptible to the senses.\r\n\r\nOn the Continent, generally, the interval observed before burial is far\r\ntoo short for safety. They calculate that in France from twenty to\r\nthirty are annually interred alive, computing from the number of those\r\nwho, after supposed death, come to life before the funeral is completed.\r\nI cannot help imagining that this seeming death must be much less\r\nfrequent in England than in some other countries; (is that owing to the\r\nmore vigorous practice for which English medical men are celebrated,\r\nthey either cure or kill?) In Germany, interment is forbidden by law for\r\nthree days after death. And there is a curious and humane provision in\r\nthe grave-houses attached to the cemeteries of some of the principal\r\ntowns: Bodies which are brought too soon, not having performed the three\r\ndays' quarantine, are received and lodged, being disposed upon tressles,\r\nwith rings on their toes and fingers which are attached to bell-pulls.\r\nThe corpse thus, on coming to itself, may have immediate attendance\r\nmerely by ringing for it; some one is always there on the watch. But the\r\nhumanity of this arrangement, though perfect as long as it lasts, is\r\nfinite in duration. As soon as the seventy-two hours prescribed by law\r\nare expired, it is another thing. The body is then legally dead, and\r\nmust comport itself accordingly. At any rate, it is at its own risk if\r\nit behaves otherwise than as a corpse, and gives itself any airs of\r\nvitality. This is appalling enough, and would certainly justify any\r\nbody, if it could, in getting out at nights and turning vampyr.\r\n\r\nAnd now, to return again to our inquiry. We have got thus far. The\r\nbodies found in the so-called vampyr state are alive. They are in a sort\r\nof fit, the possible duration of which is undetermined. The same fit may\r\noccur, and does occur continually, with no reference to the superstition\r\nof vampyrism. But where the belief in vampyrism is rife, these fits are\r\nmore prevalent, and spread sometimes like an epidemic.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally follows, how is this malady, viewing it as one in\r\nthese cases, propagated?\r\n\r\nAt such seasons, it is far from improbable that there is some physical\r\ncause in operation, some meteorological influence perhaps, electrical or\r\notherwise, disposing the system to be a readier prey to the seizure. As\r\ncertain constitutions of the year alter the blood and lead to fever or\r\ncholera, why should not others render the nervous system irritable and\r\nproner to derangement?\r\n\r\nThen it is well known that fright will bring on certain kinds of\r\nfits--in women hysteric fits, in the youth of either sex epileptic fits;\r\nand certainly no ghastlier terror can there be than the accredited\r\napprehension of vampyrism. And it deserves remark, that impressions upon\r\nthe mind are known to be capable of shaping particular kinds of fits,\r\nand especially of exciting and determining the features of sensorial\r\nillusions, that seem adjuvants in vampyrism.\r\n\r\nWe are able to creep yet a step nearer to the mark. There is great\r\nreason to believe that some human beings have had the power of throwing\r\nthemselves into the state of seeming death, _voluntarily_. In Gooch's\r\nsurgical works, there is an account of a Colonel Townsend, who asserted\r\nthis of himself, and challenged Gooch to witness the performance. And\r\nyou may read in the narrative of Gooch, how he and two or three other\r\ncompetent witnesses saw Colonel Townsend dispose himself to favour the\r\ninvasion of this fit, and how he gradually fell into a state apparently\r\ndevoid of animation. A very few years ago there was a story in the\r\npapers of a native in India, who undertook for a reward to do the same\r\nfeat, and to allow himself to be buried for a stipulated period. A\r\ngentleman, certainly not of a credulous turn in general, told me he was\r\nin India at the time with his regiment; and, though not on the spot,\r\nthat he knew the parties who brought the conjuror to work; and that he\r\nbelieved they positively buried him, and, at the end of the time agreed\r\nupon, disinterred him, and found him alive. But be _this_ story true or\r\nfalse, the case of Colonel Townsend remains to show the thing asserted\r\nto have been possible--and this remark may be safely added: Whatever\r\nchange of the kind the will can bring about, can be twice as readily\r\nwrought by fear or a disturbed imagination.\r\n\r\nYou are, I hope, or fear rather, by this time satiated with the\r\nmarvellous and with the subject. What!--yet another question? Ay. How\r\ncame this superstition to arise?\r\n\r\nThe answer is ready. In those days the belief in ghosts was absolute,\r\nand a vampyr was a sort of ghost. When an ignorant person, that is, when\r\nany one in those days became the subject of a sensorial illusion\r\nrepresenting a human being, to a certainty he identified the creation of\r\nhis fancy as somebody he had seen or heard of; then he would tell his\r\nacquaintances that the ghost of such a person haunted him. If the fright\r\nbrought on a fit, or seemed to cause his death, the neighbours would\r\nremember how he had before been haunted. Then, in any case, what more\r\nnatural than to disinter the body of a supposed visitant, to know why he\r\nis unquiet in the grave? Then, if once a body so disinterred were found\r\nin the fresh and undecomposed state, the whole delusion would start into\r\nexistence. The violence used would force blood from the corpse; and that\r\nwould be construed into the blood of a victim. The absence of a scar on\r\nthe throat of the victim, would throw no difficulty in the way to the\r\nvampyr theory, because vampyrs enjoyed the ghostly character, and all\r\nits privileges. Supposing, again, that at any time chance had brought to\r\nlight a body interred alive, and lying still in this fit, the whole yarn\r\nof superstition might again have been spun from that clue.\r\n\r\nDo you want more than this? I shall begin to think you at heart\r\nsuperstitious. I tell you it is contrary to the rules of inductive\r\nlogic, to look for, or to use more principles than are sufficient for\r\nthe reasonable explanation of phenomena. Yet you urge, do you, that it\r\nis no less unphilosophical, in an obscure and unsettled inquiry, wholly\r\nto exclude the consideration of unlikely possibilities?--Well! it is\r\nnothing to me. Have it your own way: suppose, if you like, that the man\r\nin the grave _had_ something to do with spreading the disease, and that\r\nhis nervous system, in its abnormal state, could put itself in relation\r\nwith that of another person at a distance. If you like it, have it so.\r\nIn one sense, it simplifies the matter. But though I cannot deny your\r\nsupposition to be possible, you will excuse me if I profess to hold the\r\nsolution, which I have myself given, to be sufficient.\r\n\r\nWell! _there_ is an end of the subject, at all events; and I accept your\r\nthanks for having told you all I know about vampyrism. I deserve them\r\nmore than you are aware. At the churchyard in Meduegna, my dear Archy, I\r\nhad you thoroughly in my power. I saw how your curiosity was raised, and\r\nthat an picture I had drawn would have been accepted by you with\r\navidity; and I must confess it did at one moment occur to me, to\r\ndescribe to you the exact dress and deportment of the three regimental\r\nsurgeons, or Feldscherers, (a handsome word signifying field-barbers),\r\nJohn Flickinger, Isaac Stegel, and John Fredrick Baumgartner, as well as\r\nthe behaviour and remarks of a drummer boy, who held the instrument case\r\nduring the _intermortem_ examination, an event he witnessed for the\r\nfirst time. But I would not abuse my advantage; so I let you off cheaply\r\nwith the sole fabrication of Nina, and the personal characteristics of\r\nArnod Paole, of whom unfortunately nothing has come down to posterity,\r\nbut that he was haunted by a vampyr at Cossova, fell from a hay-cart at\r\nMeduegna, and died, and lived a vampyr himself.\r\n\r\n    I remain, dear Archy,\r\n            Yours, &c.\r\n                  MAC DAVUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIRITS, GOBLINS, GHOSTS.\r\n\r\nDear Archy.--On what subject shall I next address you? Elves, goblins,\r\nghosts, real and unreal; dreams, witchcraft, second-sight? Bless me! the\r\nfield of marvels seems more thronged, as I approach it closer. The\r\nspirits I have evoked begin to scare me with their numbers. How on earth\r\nshall I ever get them fairly laid? But some, I see, can now only limp\r\nalong--they are scotched already; I will begin with finishing these. Yet\r\nthey deserve gentle treatment. They sprang from our nature, which seems\r\nexpressly made to procreate and rear them. Thick, within and around us,\r\nlie the rich veins of illusive suggestion from which they spring.\r\n\r\nThe thing nearest us is our mental constitution, the world of\r\nconsciousness. It is of it we first learn, though it be the last we\r\nunderstand. It is that through which we perceive and apprehend all other\r\nthings; and nothing becomes part of our knowledge but as it has been\r\nshaped and coloured by its magic reflexion. Nay, more, it is not only\r\nour mirror but our archetype for every thing. So we spiritualise the\r\nmaterial universe, and afterwards, by an incongruous consistency,\r\nanthropomorphise spirit.\r\n\r\nReason in vain reclaims against this misuse of analogy. Feeling,\r\nimagination, instinct are too many for her; and any mood, from fun to\r\nearnest, from nonsense to sublimity, may hear a responsive note when\r\nthis chord is touched.\r\n\r\nAddress to that ingenuous young American a remark upon the slightness of\r\nthe legs of her work-table,--she blushes--her lively fancy has given\r\nthem personality. Were she a wealthier miss, she would give them,\r\nbesides, neat cambric trowsers with lace borders. With less refinement,\r\nand with inexcusable warmth, I take shame to myself for having bestowed\r\na kick upon a similar mahogany limb, which had, however, begun the\r\ncontest by breaking my shin.\r\n\r\nTo the poet's eye, nature is instinct with life. Greece may be \"living\r\nGreece no more\"--in the soul of her people; but her immortal plains, and\r\nstreams, and hills have their own vitality.\r\n\r\n    \"The mountains _look_ on Marathon,\r\n    And Marathon _looks_ on the sea.\"\r\n\r\nYou go to visit them; they meet you half-way: \"spectatum veniunt.\"\r\n\r\nAmid the Alps--with glacier, torrent, forest around--you still evoke\r\nthe fancied spirit of the scene, though it be but\r\n\r\n    \"To gaze upon her beauty--nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nAnd where, in sublimer grandeur, snowclad, upreared against the nearer\r\nsun, are seen the towering Andes; to the poet's eye, the Cordillera lies\r\nno huge backbone of earth; but lives, a Rhoetus or Enceladus of the\r\nWest, and\r\n\r\n            \"over earth, air, wave,\r\n    Glares with his Titan eye.\"\r\n\r\nThis is but the calm, the dignified, the measured march of poetical\r\nconception. No wonder, when superstition steps in to prick on\r\nimagination, that all should vividly team with spirit life. Or that on\r\nWalpurgis' night, bush and streamlet and hill bustle and hurry, with\r\nunequal pace, towards the haunted Brocken: the heavy ones lag, indeed, a\r\nlittle, and are out of breath--\r\n\r\n    \"The giant-snouted crags, ho! ho!\r\n    How they snort and how they blow!\"\r\n\r\nNo wonder that to the dreamer's eye, in tranquil scenes of sylvan\r\nsolitude the fawn of yore skipped in the forest dell, the dryad peeped\r\nfrom behind the shadowy oak, the fay tripped lightly over the moonlit\r\nsward.\r\n\r\nBut enough, and too much, of \"your philosophy.\" Yet there are those\r\nstill who may be the wiser for it. Let me sketch you a believer in the\r\ncreed it would dispel.\r\n\r\nHe was a Spanish West-Indian--in his active years had been an extensive\r\nplanter and slave-owner in Porto Rico. His manners were grave and\r\ndignified, as due to himself; courteous, as not denying equal or\r\nsuperior worth in others. He had seen the world, and spoke of it\r\nhabitually with a fine irony. We had many a walk together. He was\r\nnervous about his health. One day, as our path lay along the banks of\r\nthe Rhine, his conversation took this turn:--\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe in spirits?\" he asked me; and upon my intimating the\r\npolite but qualified assent which suited the tone in which the question\r\nwas put--\"It may be superstition,\" he continued, \"but I am often\r\ninclined to think that the pucks and goblins, which, as they say, once\r\nhaunted these scenes, are not entirely visionary beings. You may\r\nsmile--but this has happened, nay, often, happens, to me in my walks. I\r\nsee a big clod before me in the path, and form the intention of avoiding\r\nit; when close to it, I step to one side, when pr-r-rt, my toe strikes\r\nagainst it.\"\r\n\r\nI edged slightly away from my companion with the disagreeable impression\r\nthat he was gone mad.\r\n\r\nHe went on;--\"When I lived in the West Indies, the children of the\r\nslaves, about my house, were treated with great kindness and indulgence.\r\nThey would come about my table at dessert, and often had little presents\r\ngiven them. So they grew into objects of affection. But, out of several,\r\nsome, of course, took ill and died. I cannot tell you what grief it\r\ncaused me. Then this has happened several times, after the death of one\r\nor other of my little favourites:--a bird has flown into the hall, and\r\ninto my sitting-room, and has hovered near me, and, after a while, has\r\nflown away. For a few days it has regularly returned, and then finally\r\ndisappeared. I thought it was tenanted by the spirit of my lost\r\nfavourite, which had come to bid me farewell.\"\r\n\r\nI drew nearer again to my companion. I felt I was in all events safe\r\nfrom violence from him. And I contrasted, with humiliation, his\r\nbeautiful superstition with the commonplace remembrance of a school-boy\r\nconviction of my own, one dark night, upon Blackheath, that a\r\ndirection-post was a ghost.\r\n\r\nMy friend had not, indeed, always been a dreamer: and although this is\r\nno place to narrate his course of daring and hazardous adventure, on\r\nwhich I am therefore silent, yet I wish to be allowed to re-establish\r\nhis credit for intelligence, by reporting the answer which he made, on\r\nanother occasion, to a question, as to what he thought of the\r\nemancipation of the Negroes in our colonies. \"The principle,\" answered\r\nmy friend, \"was good, but you were in too great a hurry. Before giving\r\nthem freedom, you should have made them fit for it. They were not\r\nimpatient. Slavery is an African institution. Some outlay of public\r\nmoney, and extreme care and prudence in your measures, would have\r\nenabled you to secure their humane treatment in the interval. As fast\r\nas they became innoculated with the wants and habits of civilised life,\r\nyou might have made _freedmen_ of the most advanced, and given them\r\nofficial occupation, or allotted them land under proper conditions. One\r\nsheep would have followed another. The fag-end you might have\r\nemancipated together. Thirty or forty years, and a million of money,\r\nwould have done the thing. The results would have been, from first to\r\nlast, beneficial to the colonists. It would have set an example which\r\nother nations _could_ have followed. It would have been a noble return\r\nfor having, temporarily, used the race as unmitigated slaves. It would\r\nhave been an act of enlightened philanthropy. It would have become\r\nstatesmen. What you did reads and works like the puerile suggestion of a\r\nschool-boy's theme. What you are further doing, to suppress, by force,\r\nthe trade in slaves, would have been worthy my distinguished countryman\r\nwhose biography has immortalised Cervantes. Humanity would smile at it,\r\nbut that she shudders and sickens.\"\r\n\r\nBut, to leave the region of dreams, which are no longer realisable, let\r\nus shift the scene.\r\n\r\nThe churchyard has its nightly terrors. One heard of corpse-lights seen\r\ndancing over graves--but over some alone. A few only had witnessed this;\r\nbut _they_ had no doubt on the matter. Things looked \"uncanny;\" but time\r\ndid not pause, and the story was forgotten. Even when the tale was\r\nfresh, what was it but superstition? Who of those who hugged its\r\nsympathetic terrors by the Christmas fireside, thought they could be\r\ntrue on the bright frosty morning of the morrow? It was mere fancy.\r\nThere was nothing in it. Yet there _was_ something. And now and then a\r\nstriking and mysterious event would occur to bring back the old idea.\r\nThere was a cottage, (this I heard of a certainty,) in a hamlet I could\r\nname, to which a bad report attached. A room in it was haunted. More\r\nthan one who had slept there had seen, at midnight, the luminous\r\napparition of a little child standing upon the hearth-stone. At length\r\nsuspicion became active. The hearth-stone was raised, and there were\r\nfound, buried beneath it, the remains of an infant. A story was now\r\ndivulged, how the former tenant and a female of the neighbourhood had, a\r\nvery few years before, abruptly left the village. The apparition here\r\nwas real and significant enough.\r\n\r\n    \"It will have blood, they say; blood will have blood.\r\n    Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak:\r\n    Augurs and understood relations have,\r\n    By magot-pyes, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth\r\n    The secret'st man of blood.\"\r\n\r\nBut tales like these, though true, gradually lose the sharpness of their\r\nevidence for want of an accredited contemporary narrator, and so become\r\nvalueless. But time brings round every thing.\r\n\r\nAnd at length a marvellous narrative, to the same effect with the above,\r\nmade its appearance in a trustworthy German work, _P. Kieffer's\r\nArchives_, the complete authentication of which caused it to make a deep\r\nimpression. The narrative was communicated by Herr Ehrman of Strasburg,\r\nthe son-in-law of the well-known German writer Pfeffel, from whom he\r\nreceived it.\r\n\r\nThe ghost-seer was a young candidate for orders, eighteen years of age,\r\nof the name of Billing. He was known to have very excitable nerves,--had\r\nalready experienced sensorial illusions, and was particularly sensitive\r\nto the presence of human remains, which made him tremble and shudder in\r\nall his limbs. Pfeffel, being blind, was accustomed to take the arm of\r\nthis young man, and they walked thus together in Pfeffel's garden, near\r\nColmar. At one spot in the garden Pfeffel remarked, that his companion's\r\narm gave a sudden start, as if he had received an electric shock. Being\r\nasked what was the matter, Billing replied, \"nothing.\" But, on their\r\ngoing over the same spot again, the same effect recurred. The young man\r\nbeing pressed to explain the cause of his disturbance, avowed that it\r\narose from a peculiar sensation which he always experienced when in the\r\nvicinity of human remains; that it was his impression a human body must\r\nbe interred there; but that if Pfeffel would return with him at night,\r\nhe should be able to speak with more confidence. Accordingly, they went\r\nto the garden together when it was dark, and as they approached the\r\nspot, Billing observed a faint light over it. At two paces from it, he\r\nstopped and would go no further; for he saw hovering over it, or\r\nself-supported in the air, its feet only a few inches from the ground, a\r\nluminous female figure, nearly five feet high, with the right arm folded\r\non her breast, the left hanging by her side. When Pfeffel himself\r\nstepped forward and placed himself about where the figure was, Billing\r\nsaid it was now on his right hand, now on his left, now behind, now\r\nbefore him. When Pfeffel cut the air with his stick, it seemed as if it\r\nwent through and divided a light flame, which then united again. The\r\nvisit, repeated the next night, in company with some of Pfeffel's\r\nrelatives, gave the same result. _They_ did not see any thing. Pfeffel,\r\nthen, unknown to the ghost-seer, had the ground dug up, when there was\r\nfound at some depth, beneath a layer of quicklime, a decomposing human\r\nbody. The remains were removed, and the earth carefully replaced. Three\r\ndays afterwards, Billing, from whom this whole proceeding had been kept\r\nconcealed, was again led to the spot by Pfeffel. He walked over it now\r\nwithout experiencing any unusual impression whatever.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary phenomenon, it is now generally known, has been\r\ncompletely elucidated through the discoveries of Von Reichenbach, to\r\nwhich, in a former letter, I had occasion to make allusion.\r\n\r\nYou are probably aware, that the individuals whose nerves Von\r\nReichenbach found to be so sensitive to the proximity of crystals,\r\nmagnets, &c., would, in the dark, see flames issuing from the same\r\nsubstances. Then, in the progress of his inquiries, Von Reichenbach\r\nfound that chemical decomposition was a rich source of the new power he\r\nhad discovered, by its action on the nerves. And being acquainted with\r\nthe story of the ghost in Pfeffel's garden at Colmar, it occurred to him\r\nas not unlikely, that Billing had just been in the same condition with\r\nhis own sensitive patients, and that graves very likely would present to\r\nall of them a luminous _aura_; and that thus the mystery might find a\r\nvery simple explanation.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Miss Reichel, one of his most sensitive subjects, was taken\r\nat night to an extensive burying-ground, near Vienna, where many\r\ninterments take place daily, and there were some thousand graves. The\r\nresult did not disappoint Von Reichenbach's expectations. Whithersoever\r\nMiss Reichel turned her eyes, she saw masses of flame. This appearance\r\nmanifested itself most about recent graves. About very old ones it was\r\nnot visible. She described the appearance as resembling less bright\r\nflame than fiery vapour, something between fog and flame. In several\r\ninstances, the light extended four feet in height above the ground. When\r\nMiss Reichel placed her hand in it, it seemed to her involved in a cloud\r\nof fire. When she stood in it, it came up to her throat. She expressed\r\nno alarm, being accustomed to the appearance.\r\n\r\nThe mystery has thus been entirely solved. For it is evident that the\r\nspectral character of the luminous apparition in the two instances I\r\nhave narrated had been supplied by the imagination of the seers. So the\r\nsuperstition has vanished, leaving, as is usual, a very respectable\r\ntruth behind it.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a little unlucky for this new truth, which reveals either a\r\nnew power in nature or an unexpected operation of familiar ones, that\r\nthe phenomena which attest it are verifiable by a few only who are\r\npossessed of highly sensitive temperaments. And it is the use of the\r\nworld to look upon these few as very suspicious subjects. This is\r\nunjust. Their evidence, the parties having otherwise a character for\r\nhonesty, should be accepted with the same faith and the same distrust\r\nwith which all evidence is to be viewed; with neither more nor less than\r\nin other cases. Nothing should be received in scientific inquiry which\r\nit is not compulsory on our understanding to believe. It is not a whit\r\nmore difficult in these than in other cases to obtain inductive\r\ncertainty. Nature is not here peculiarly coy or averse from being\r\ninterrogated.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers occasionally regret the limited number of their senses, and\r\nthink a world of knowledge would flow from their possessing but one\r\nmore. Now, persons of highly-wrought nervous systems have what is\r\nequivalent to a new sense, in their augmentation of natural sensibility.\r\nBut philosophers will not accept this equivalent. They must have the\r\nboon from nature their own way, or not at all.\r\n\r\nTo turn elsewhere.--We may now look into a broader seam of illusive\r\npower--one which lies entirely within ourselves, and needs no objective\r\ninfluence to bring its ghost-producing fertility into play. Let me\r\nexemplify it in operation.\r\n\r\nA young gentleman, who has recently left Oxford, told me, that he was\r\none evening at a supper-party in college, when they were joined by a\r\ncommon friend on his return from hunting. They expected him, but were\r\nstruck with his appearance. He was pale and agitated. On questioning\r\nhim, they learned the cause. During the latter part of his ride home, he\r\nhad been accompanied by a horseman, who kept exact pace with him, the\r\nrider and horse being facsimiles of himself and the steed he rode, even\r\nto the copy of a newfangled bit he sported that day for the first time.\r\nThe apparition vanished on his entering the town. He had, in fact, seen\r\nhis double or fetch, and it had shaken his nerves pretty considerably.\r\nHis friends advised him to consult the college tutor, who failed not to\r\ngive him some good advice, and hoped the warning would not be thrown\r\naway. My informant, who thought the whole matter very serious, and was\r\ndisposed to believe the unearthly visit to have been no idle one, added,\r\nthat it _had_ made the ghost-seer, for the time at all events, a wiser\r\nand better man.\r\n\r\nIn more ignorant times, the appearance of one's fetch was held to be of\r\nvery alarming import, and to menace either death or serious personal\r\nharm. Now, it is known to be one of the commonest forms in which\r\n_sensorial illusions_ shape themselves. And these are matters of\r\nevery-day occurrence.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, that when the blood is heated or the nervous system\r\nover-strained, we are liable to attach reality to the mere productions\r\nof the imagination. There must be few who have not had personal\r\nexperience of this affection. In the first night of a febrile attack,\r\nand often in the progress of fever, the bed-hangings appear to the\r\npatient swarming with human faces, generally of a disagreeable and\r\nmenacing expression. With some, opium will produce a host of similar\r\nvisitants. In much illness, I have often myself taken this drug, and\r\nalways hoped it would provide me a crop of apparitions that I might\r\nanalyse. But I was disappointed; opium I found to give me only a great\r\ntranquillity and clearness of thought. Once or twice only have I had a\r\nvision, and that but a transitory landscape. I used in vain to look upon\r\nthat _black mixture_ which lies before one in the dark, and try to make\r\nits fragmentary lights arrange themselves into definite shapes. And I\r\nhave imaged to my mind familiar scenes or faces, (as in the daytime a\r\nstrong conception will half realise such,) but they were not more\r\ndistinct then than formerly,--ideas only and perfectly transient. But,\r\nas I have said, once or twice I have had the satisfaction of seeing a\r\nbright and coloured landscape spread before my view; yet unlike reality,\r\nand more resembling a diorama, occupying a rectangle on the black\r\nmixture before my eyes. It was not a known and familiar scene, but a\r\nbrilliant sketch, made out of materials I remembered, but could not by a\r\ndeliberate effort _have combined_ so effectively. It was a spontaneous\r\nthroe of the imagination, which had force to overpersuade the organs of\r\nperception.\r\n\r\nHow well did Shakspeare understand this creative power of the\r\nfancy!--the air-drawn dagger of Macbeth, and his test--\"come, let me\r\nclutch thee!\" are physiologically perfect. Nor less perfect or true to\r\nnature, is the conception of the ghost of Banquo haunting the kingly\r\nmurderer. The ghost, it is obvious, however, should not in the play\r\nappear bodily. The audience are in the position of the guests at the\r\nroyal supper-table, who saw it not. I wonder how in Shakspeare's time\r\nthe stage-directions ran upon this point. Probably as now. Though\r\nShakspeare wrote for all times, he was probably wise enough to act for\r\nthe present. Or perhaps, with no disrespect to his unequalled genius, he\r\nunderstood not the principles of which he exactly portrayed the\r\nworkings, and was, like Shelley's poet,\r\n\r\n    \"Hidden in the light of thought.\"\r\n\r\nSo, some say the sun may be dark as another planet; and that the spots\r\non it are its common earth seen through the gaps in its luminous\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nTo the world, the alpha and omega of this piece of philosophy were\r\nfurnished by the publication of the case of Nicolai, the bookseller of\r\nBerlin. Its details were read before the Academy of Sciences at Berlin,\r\nin 1799. The _substance_ ran thus. Nicolai had had some family troubles\r\nwhich much annoyed him. Then, on the 21st of February 1791, there stood\r\nbefore him, at the distance of ten paces, the ghost of his eldest son.\r\nHe pointed at it, directing his wife to look. She saw it not, and tried\r\nto convince him that it was an illusion. In a quarter of an hour it\r\nvanished. In the afternoon, at four o'clock, it came again. Nicolai was\r\nalone. He went to his wife's room--the ghost followed him. About six\r\nother apparitions joined the first, and they walked about, among, and\r\nthrough each other. After some days the apparition of his son stayed\r\naway; but its place was filled with the figures of a number of persons,\r\nsome known, some unknown to Nicolai--some of dead, others of living\r\npersons. The known ones were distant acquaintances only. The figures of\r\nnone of Nicolai's habitual friends were there. The appearances were\r\nalmost always human: exceptionally, a man on horseback, with dogs and\r\nbirds would present themselves. The apparitions came mostly after\r\ndinner, at the commencement of digestion. They were just like real\r\npersons; the colouring a thought fainter. The apparitions were equally\r\ndistinct whether Nicolai was alone or in society, by day as in the dark,\r\nin his own house or those of others; but in the latter case they were\r\nless frequent, and they very seldom presented themselves in the streets.\r\nDuring the first eight days they seemed to take very little notice of\r\neach other, but walked about like people at a fair, only here and there\r\ncommuning with each other. They took no notice of Nicolai, or of his\r\nremarks about them to his wife and physician. No effort of his would\r\ndismiss them, or bring an absent one back. When he shut his eyes, they\r\nsometimes disappeared, sometimes remained; when he opened his eyes, they\r\nwere there as before. After a week they became more numerous, and began\r\nto converse. They conversed with each other, and then addressed him.\r\nTheir remarks were short and unconnected, but sensible and civil. His\r\nacquaintances inquired after his health, and expressed sympathy for him,\r\nand spoke in terms comforting him. The apparitions were most conversible\r\nwhen he was alone; nevertheless they mingled in the conversation when\r\nothers were by, and their voices had the same sound as those of real\r\npersons. This illusion went on thus from the 24th of February to the\r\n20th of April; so that Nicolai, who was in good bodily health, had time\r\nto become tranquillised about them, and to observe them at his ease. At\r\nlast they rather amused him. Then the doctors thought of an efficient\r\nplan of treatment. They prescribed leeches: and then followed the\r\n_denouement_ to this interesting representation. The apparitions became\r\npale and vanished. On the 20th of April, at the time of applying the\r\nleeches, Nicolai's room was full of figures moving about among each\r\nother. They first began to have a less lively motion; shortly afterwards\r\ntheir colours became paler--in another half hour fainter still, though\r\nthe forms still remained. About seven o'clock in the evening, the\r\nfigures had became colourless, and they moved scarcely at all, but their\r\noutline was still tolerably perfect. Gradually that became less and less\r\ndefined. At last they disappeared, breaking into air, fragments only\r\nremaining, which at last all vanished. By eight o'clock all were gone,\r\nand Nicolai subsequently saw no more of them.\r\n\r\nOther cases are on record in which there was still greater facility of\r\nghost-production than Nicolai evinced. One patient could, for instance,\r\nby thinking of a person, summon his apparition to join the others. He\r\ncould not, however, having done this, subsequently banish him. The sight\r\nis the sense most easily and frequently tricked; next, the hearing. In\r\nsome extraordinary cases the touch, also, has participated in the\r\ndelusion.\r\n\r\nHerr von Baczko, already subject to visual hallucinations, of a diseased\r\nnervous system, his right side weak with palsy, his right eye blind, and\r\nthe vision of the left imperfect, was engaged one evening, shortly after\r\nthe battle of Jena, as he tells us in his autobiography, in translating\r\na brochure into Polish, when he felt a poke in his loins. He looked\r\nround, and found that it proceeded from a Negro or Egyptian boy,\r\nseemingly about twelve years of age. Although he was persuaded the whole\r\nwas an illusion, he thought it best to knock the apparition down, when\r\nhe felt that it offered a sensible resistance. The Negro then attacked\r\nhim on the other side, and gave his left arm a particularly disagreeable\r\ntwist, when Baczko pushed him off again. The Negro continued to visit\r\nhim constantly during four months, preserving the same appearance, and\r\nremaining tangible; then he came seldomer; and, after finally appearing\r\nas a brown-coloured apparition with an owl's head, he took his leave.\r\n\r\nThe illusion and its principle having been thus elucidated, it is hardly\r\nworth while to look into its operation in tales of vulgar terror. But it\r\nis highly interesting to trace its effects on minds of a high order,\r\nwhen its suggestions have been received and interpreted as the visits\r\nand communications of superior beings. You have heard, I dare say, my\r\ndear Archy, of the mysticism of Schwedenborg. Now that they are\r\nexplained, the details of his hallucinations are highly gratifying to\r\none's curiosity.\r\n\r\nSchwedenborg, the son of a Swedish clergyman of the name of Schwedberg,\r\nennobled as Schwedenborg, was, up to the year 1743, which was the\r\nfifty-fourth of his age, an ordinary man of the world, distinguished\r\nonly in literature, having written many volumes of philosophy and\r\nscience, and being Professor in the Mineralogical school, where he was\r\nmuch respected. On a sudden, in the year 1743, he believed himself to\r\nhave got into a commerce with the world of spirits, which so fully took\r\npossession of his thoughts, that he not only published their\r\nrevelations, but was in the habit of detailing, with the greatest\r\nequanimity, his daily chat with them. Thus he says, \"I had a\r\nconversation the other day on that very point with the Apostle Paul,\" or\r\nwith Luther, or some other dead person. Schwedenborg continued in what\r\nhe believed to be daily communion with spirits till his death, in 1772.\r\nHe was, without doubt, in the fullest degree convinced of the reality of\r\nhis spiritual commerce. So in a letter to the Wirtemburg prelate,\r\nOetinger, dated November 11, 1766, he uses the following words:--\"If I\r\nhave spoken with the Apostles? To this I answer, I conversed with St\r\nPaul during a whole year, particularly on the text, Romans iii. 28. I\r\nhave three times conversed with St John, once with Moses, and a hundred\r\ntimes with Luther, who allowed that it was against the warning of an\r\nangel that he professed '_fidem solam_,' and that he stood alone upon\r\nthe separation from the Pope. With angels, finally, have I these\r\ntwenty-two years conversed, and converse daily.\r\n\r\n\"Of the angels,\" he says, \"they have human forms, the appearance of men\r\nthat I have a thousand times seen; for I have spoken with them as a man\r\nwith other men, often with several together; and have seen nothing in\r\nthe least to distinguish them from ordinary men.\" [They had evidently\r\njust the appearance of Nicolai's visitors.] \"Lest any one should call\r\nthis an illusion, or imaginary perception, it is to be understood that I\r\nam accustomed to see them, when perfectly myself wide awake, and in full\r\nexercise of my observation. The speech of an angel or of a spirit sounds\r\nlike, and as loud as, that of a man, but it is not heard by the\r\nbystanders; the reason is, that the speech of an angel or a spirit finds\r\nentrance first into a man's thoughts, and reaches his organs of hearing\r\nfrom within outwards.\" This is indeed _cum ratione insanire_! how just\r\nan analysis of the illusion, when he is most deceived by it!\r\n\r\n\"The angels who converse with men, speak not in their own language, but\r\nin the language of men, and likewise in other languages which are\r\ninwardly known to man, not in languages which he does not understand.\"\r\nSchwedenborg here took up the angels, and to explain their own ideas to\r\nthem observed, that they most likely appeared to speak his mother\r\ntongue, _because, in fact_, it was not they who spoke, but himself by\r\ntheir suggestion. The angels held out, however, and went away\r\nunconvinced.\r\n\r\n\"When approaching, the angels often appear like a ball of light; and\r\nthey travel in companies so grouped together--they are allowed so to\r\nunite by the Lord--that they may act as one being, and share each\r\nothers' ideas and knowledge; and in this form they bound through the\r\nuniverse, from planet to planet.\"\r\n\r\nI will, in conclusion, add another different, but equally interesting\r\nsketch.\r\n\r\n\"It is now seven years ago,\" so spoke, before her judges, the simple,\r\nbut high-minded Joan of Arc--\"the beginning of the year 1431; it was a\r\nsummer day, towards the middle hour, I was about thirteen years old, and\r\nwas in my father's garden, that I heard for the first time, on my right\r\nhand towards the church, a voice, and there stood a figure in a bright\r\nradiance before my eyes. It had the appearance and look of a right good\r\nand virtuous man, bore wings, was surrounded with light on all sides,\r\nand by the angels of Heaven. It was the Archangel Michael. The voice\r\nseemed to me to command respect; but I was yet a child, and was\r\nfrightened at the figure, and doubted very much whether it was the\r\narchangel! I saw him and the angels as distinctly before my eyes as I\r\nnow see you, my judges.\" With words of encouragement the archangel\r\nanswered to her, that God had taken pity upon France, and that she must\r\nhasten to the assistance of the king. At the same time he promised her\r\nthat St Catherine and St Margaret would shortly visit her; he told her\r\nthat she should do what they commanded her, because they were sent by\r\nGod to guide and conduct her. \"Upon this,\" continued Joan, \"St Catherine\r\nand St Margaret appeared to me, as the angel had foretold. They ordered\r\nme to get ready to go to Robert de Beaudricourt, the king's captain. He\r\nwould several times refuse me, but at last would consent, and give me\r\npeople, who would conduct me to the king. Then should I raise the siege\r\nof Orleans. I replied to them that I was a poor child, who understood\r\nnothing about riding on horseback and making war. They said I should\r\ncarry my banner with courage; God would help me, and win back for my\r\nking his entire kingdom. As soon as I knew,\" continued Joan, \"that I was\r\nto proceed on this errand, I avoided, as much as I could, afterwards\r\ntaking part in the sports and amusements of my young companions.\"----\"So\r\nhave the Saints conducted me during seven years, and have given me\r\nsupport and assistance in all my need and labours; and now at present,\"\r\nsaid she to her judges, \"no day goes by, but they come to me.\"----\"I\r\nseldom see the Saints that they are not surrounded with a halo of light;\r\nthey wear rich and precious crowns, as it is reasonable they should. I\r\nsee them always under the same forms, and have never found in their\r\ndiscourse any discrepancies. I know how to distinguish one from the\r\nother, and distinguish them as well by the sound of their voices as by\r\ntheir salutation. They come often without my calling upon them. But when\r\nthey do not come, I pray to the Lord that he will send them to me; and\r\nnever have I needed them but they have visited me.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is part of the defence of the high-spirited Joan of Arc, who was\r\ntaken prisoner by the Duke of Burgundy on the 23d of May 1430--sold by\r\nhim for a large sum to the English, and by them put on her trial as a\r\nheretic, idolatress, and magician--condemned, and finally burned alive,\r\nthe 30th of May 1431. Ill-fated heroine! I seem to be thinking of\r\nwriting her epitaph, but I am considering only that there is more to\r\ncome out of her evidence. For although her heavenly visitants were\r\nsimply sensorial illusions, there yet remains something unexplained. How\r\ncame she to foresee the path she was destined to follow? The inquiry\r\nwould launch us on a broad and wild sea of conjecture, for the\r\nnavigation of which we have not yet the requisite charts on board, and\r\nit grows late--so good-night, dear Archy.\r\n\r\n    \"Suadentque cadentia sidera somnum.\"\r\n        \"Cras ingens iterabimus aequor.\"\r\n\r\n    Yours, &c.,\r\n            MAC DAVUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY.\r\n\r\nTHE BATHS OF MONT DOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a tremendous valley opening all the way down, from the central\r\nsummits of the ridge of the Monts Dor, quite into the undulating, and\r\nthence into the flat country, lying westward of this mountain chain.\r\nWhere the valley commences, it is nothing more than a combination of\r\nmountain gullies, and is like a wild and precipitous ravine; but by\r\ndegrees it widens out into spacious amphitheatres, and at times\r\ncontracts itself again so as barely to allow of a struggling river to\r\nmake its way betwixt the rocky sides. In some places, the valley makes a\r\nstraight reach four or five miles in extent, but in others, winds and\r\nturns about in abrupt and varied curves; its descent is now gradual, and\r\nnow rapid, where the stream dashes over ledges of rock or cuts its way\r\nthrough some rough and stubborn pass. Nearly all the ravines and smaller\r\nvalleys that open into it bring down their contributions of mountain\r\ntorrents; and the whole collection of waters, thus wending their way to\r\nthe ocean, form what is called the Dor. This river meets with the Dogne\r\nlower down in its course; and, under the joint name of the two waters,\r\nthe flood rushes broad and strong through Guienne into the Gironde. The\r\nhigh and bare mountain whence the Dor derives its principal source is\r\nthe Pic de Sancy, the loftiest hill in the middle of France; it is the\r\nking of all the volcanoes of this vast igneous chain, and has its sides\r\ndeeply furrowed and excavated into immense craters or volcanic vents.\r\nFrom it proceed numerous branches or arms, composed of basaltic currents\r\ncongealed into columnar masses in the early days of the world. These\r\nstretch out league after league, away from their parent head, and\r\npresent on their tops vast plateaux of green and moory pasture-land;\r\nwhile their sides are either abrupt precipices of basaltic columns, or\r\nelse are clothed with primeval forests, which have sprung up and still\r\nflourish on the rich materials of their decomposing slopes. The valley\r\nof the Dor is therefore shut in either by precipitous volcanic walls, or\r\nis guarded by sombre woods. Once on the tops of the plateaux, and you\r\nmay ride a whole day on unbroken turf; or, if you penetrate within the\r\nforest lands, you may wander for any time you please, days or weeks,\r\nwithout seeing either their beginning or their end. On the summits of\r\nthe mountains around, snow is to be found in patches, even in the\r\nhottest days of summer; and as the Pic de Sancy is more than six\r\nthousand feet above the level of the sea, almost every gradation of\r\nclimate is to be found amongst these lonely hills. In the dog-days, the\r\nvalleys are so hot that you gladly escape to the upper lands for air and\r\ncoolness; but the winter sets in, in October, and the valley of the Dor\r\nis then covered deep with snow for many a long month. The Dor itself is\r\na pleasant lively stream: it can boast of some picturesque falls here\r\nand there, but it is commonly a \"brawling brook,\" winding about at its\r\npleasure; allowing itself to be forded every now and then; and producing\r\nplenty of small trout for those who like to waste their time in fishing.\r\n\r\nThe urchins of the peasant tribe know how to get these finny creatures\r\nmore cannily than the professed angler; you may see them on a summer's\r\nmorning wading up the stream, and hunting under every stone, and in each\r\nlittle pool, for the objects of their search. As soon as they see a\r\ntrout, they drive it into little convenient nooks that they know of, and\r\nthere--how they manage it nobody knows, but the result is certain--they\r\ncatch them with their hands or knock them on the head with their sticks;\r\nand will always produce you a respectable dish at a few hours' notice.\r\n\r\nAbout a couple of leagues below the Pic de Sancy, towards the west, one\r\nof the plateaux on the northern side of the valley assumes an\r\nexceedingly bold and regular appearance; it is called the Plateau de\r\nl'Angle--perhaps from its making, by an abrupt termination, the corner\r\nof two valleys; and it towers out like a promontory at sea, soaring\r\nsome four or five hundred feet above the bed of the river. Not very far\r\nfrom where this plateau is cut off--a mile or so--there is a bold\r\ncascade dashing over its side, and carrying off the superfluous waters\r\nof a pool and morass higher up in the bosom of the mountains. Here the\r\nbasaltic precipice is hollowed out into a circling chasm, and over its\r\nblack face rushes the impetuous stream upon a huge chaos of rocks and\r\ndebris below, foaming and roaring until it finds its way into the Dor\r\nfar down in the valley at its foot. A few hundred feet to the westward\r\nof this cascade, and at the lowest part of the precipitous columnar\r\ncliff, burst forth several copious fountains of hot mineral waters,\r\nhalf-way to boiling heat when they leave their rocky cells, and ever\r\nkeeping up the same degree both of heat and quantity. These are the\r\nsprings which give celebrity to the place, and constitute the baths of\r\nMont Dor.\r\n\r\nThe Romans--those true \"rerum domini\"--knew of the spot, as they did of\r\nmost other good things within their wide empire; and they frequented\r\nthese springs so much that they erected over them a magnificent bathing\r\nestablishment, and adorned the spot with a beautiful temple. In the\r\nmidst of the present village stand the remains of one and the other of\r\ntheir buildings; and thus the hydropathic system of the ancients is\r\nallied with the practice of the modern Academie de Medecine. No records\r\nof the destruction, nor indeed of the existence, of this Roman\r\nwatering-place have been preserved; probably, the buildings fell into\r\nnatural decay, and during the middle ages were allowed to remain\r\nunrepaired and unheeded. Only foundations, broken shafts of columns,\r\ncornices, capitals, and altars are now discernible; but they are enough\r\nto add greatly to the interest of the locality.\r\n\r\nAt Saint Nectaire, two leagues further down the valley, and indeed at\r\nother spots in it, thermal sources not much inferior to those of Mont\r\nDor are to be met with; the whole district bears intimate evidence of\r\nits volcanic nature, and the rheumatic or dyspeptic invalid may here get\r\nstewed or washed out to his full satisfaction and lasting benefit.\r\n\r\nThe village of Mont Dor-les-Bains is, however, that which has been\r\nselected by the _beau monde_ of France as one of their choicest places\r\nof resort; and here public money has been added to the efforts of\r\nprivate speculation in order to render the baths at once ample and\r\ncommodious. Over the best sources is erected a large edifice, the lower\r\nstory of which is occupied by halls, and bathing-rooms for every variety\r\nof medical purpose; while above are assembly-rooms, and the apartments\r\nof the Government physician.\r\n\r\nThe distribution below is most convenient. The water, after issuing from\r\nthe rock, is conveyed by distinct channels into numerous baths contained\r\nin small chambers on either side of a large central hall: while other\r\nconduits take it to plunging and swimming baths, to douches, and to\r\nother medical contrivances. In the small single baths you receive the\r\nwater piping hot from the rock, at about one hundred degrees of\r\nFahrenheit; and you may lie there, bolling away--for a constant supply\r\nof the same natural water keeps running into and through your bath--for\r\nhours together, upon payment of _a franc_. The water costs nothing; the\r\nbuilding has been erected at the public expense, and the visitor\r\ntherefore enjoys this luxury at a moderate rate. For the poorer class of\r\npatients gratuitous baths are provided; and in fact the gifts of nature\r\nare here grudged to no one, but every man's wants may be gratified in a\r\nliberal manner.\r\n\r\nBy four o'clock in the morning of a summer day, you may see a train of\r\nghost-like beings winding along the village street, clad in the simple\r\nattire of a chemise, a blanket, and the eternal nightcap--lean,\r\nsallow-faced, or crippled mortals, who have had the wise precaution to\r\nundress at home, and not being afraid of shocking the wood-nymphs from\r\ntheir propriety, sally forth to court the Goddess of Health. They\r\ncongregate in a dark cellar-like chamber, round an ample and steaming\r\npool, and then sink into it, to forget for a while all their pains and\r\nmaladies, and to enjoy that indescribably delightful sensation of having\r\nthe joints gently unscrewed and fresh oiled. Others, whose shoulders\r\nand backs have known the pangs of lumbago and acute rheumatism, are put\r\nunder one of the douches; and down comes on them a discharge of the hot\r\nfluid as if from the hose of a fire-engine, or as though shot out from\r\nsome bursting steam-boiler. Away fly the pains and troubles of humanity;\r\nthe rickety machine is put in order for that day at least, and\r\ntwenty-four hours of peaceful enjoyment is the almost invariable\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nLater on in the morning, the fashionable visitors crawl forth to the\r\nbaths; but not so late that nine o'clock does not see them all safely\r\nhoused again after their ablutions, shaving or curling away with might\r\nand main to get ready for a grand _dejeuner_. For here, as at Bath, not\r\nonly is it well to remember the inscription,--\r\n\r\n    \"[Greek: ariston men udor]\"\r\n\r\nbut it would be advisable to add,\r\n\r\n    \"[Greek: Broma de megiston]:\"\r\n\r\nseeing that the appetite which is got up by all this early rising, and\r\nsteaming, and washing, is doomed to be satisfied in a way fully worthy\r\nof the most refined French _cuisine_.\r\n\r\nIn the village there are numerous hotels and boarding-houses, capable of\r\nsuiting the pockets and the wishes of all the middling, and even of the\r\nlower classes of society:--but there are three or four principal\r\nhouses,--and especially two, reserved for the aristocracy; and here all\r\nthe _elite_ of the visitors congregate. We wealthy English may laugh at\r\nthe moderate expense for which this kind of thing can be done in France,\r\nbut we are not apt to grumble at it when we find it suit our pockets;\r\nand, therefore, take with you at once the description of the kind of\r\nfare you are likely to meet with here, and the amount of damage it will\r\ndo to your fortune. In these large hotels, then, which are commodious\r\nhouses, a vast number of bedrooms are provided for the guests, and two\r\ngood reception-rooms; besides an immense _salle-a-manger_. Some sixty or\r\na hundred guests can be accommodated in each house, and can sit down at\r\ntable together. Breakfast is served between nine and ten,--and a\r\nglorious breakfast it is! All kinds of good things, which an old\r\n_artiste_ from Paris comes down for the season to cook: ending with\r\nfruits of many kinds and _cafe-au-lait_--that Continental beverage which\r\nJohn Bull can no more imitate than he can the wines of the Rhone or the\r\nRhine:--in short, 'tis as good a breakfast as they could put on the\r\ntable at Verey's. Dinner is ready at six, and maintains its proper\r\nsuperiority over the breakfast, both in the number of dishes and in the\r\nlength of its service. The wines are good, and the fruits delicious, for\r\nthey all come from Clermont--whence many a wagon-load of comestibles is\r\ntugged weekly over the mountains to satisfy the exigencies of the\r\nfastidious invalids!\r\n\r\nWell: they give you these two glorious spreads, your room, your light,\r\nyour linen, and your attendance, for _five francs a-day_.\r\n\r\nAnd how is this day passed? Why, 'tis a true castle of indolence, is\r\nMont Dor-les-Bains; \"a pleasing land of sleepy-head,\" where every one\r\nfollows the bent of his own fancy, and where the only serious occupation\r\nis, to forget all care and to do nothing. After rising from the\r\nbreakfast table, parties are immediately formed for the promenade or the\r\ndistant excursion; and, for the latter, some two or three score of boys\r\nand girls are stationed on the Grande Place, each in charge of an animal\r\ndisguised with the name of a horse, which you hire for the whole day, to\r\ngo where, and how far you please, for the enormous sum of _two francs_.\r\nIt is true that the animal has neither symmetry nor blood, but it is the\r\nindigenous pony of these mountains; it is a slow, sure-footed beast, and\r\nit will carry you up and down the steepest hill-side with exemplary\r\npatience and sagacity. Do not lose your own patience, however, if you\r\nmount one of them. They have no trotting, nor galloping, nor any other\r\npace whatever in them, out of the half-amble half-walk at which they\r\ncommonly proceed. But then, they know no better food than\r\nmountain-grass, or the occasional luxury of some chopped straw, and they\r\nwill follow you all round the village for a slice of bread held before\r\ntheir noses. Nevertheless they suit the country; they accommodate the\r\nvisitors; and there is not a spare horse to be got in the village by\r\nhalf-past ten, for love or money.\r\n\r\nThe day's ramble ended, and dinner duly dismissed, every body--that is\r\nto say, every body who is any body at all--adjourns to the _salle de\r\nreunion_, the large assembly-room built over the baths. This is really a\r\nhandsome well-arranged ball-room, full of mirrors, ottomans, and\r\nbenches; at one end is a billiard and card room, and behind are rooms\r\nfor robing. Here, upon the payment of a napoleon, you have the _entree_\r\nfor the season; and here the guests meet, more upon the terms of a large\r\nfamily than as though they were strangers. Etiquette is relaxed; every\r\nbody knows every body. The elder men take to billiards and\r\n_ecarte_,--the graver ladies form into little _coteries_; a younger one\r\ngoes to the piano, a circle is made, a romance is sung; and then, as the\r\nstrain becomes lighter, the feet beat in sympathy, and the gay quadrille\r\nis formed. At eight or nine o'clock the room is at its fullest; the\r\nvillage minstrels are called in--some half-dozen violins, a clarionet,\r\nand a cornet; the music becomes louder, the mazy waltz is danced, and\r\nthe enjoyment of the day is at its crowning point.\r\n\r\nHappy, happy days! still happier, still more delightful nights! No\r\ntrouble, no excess--health and cheerfulness going hand-in-hand. The most\r\nrefined society in France, and yet the most simple and most unaffected;\r\ngood-humour and politeness ruling all things: all calculated for\r\nenjoyment, nought for disquietude and regret!\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock it is understood that every body vacates the room;\r\nand, within half an hour after, not a sound is to be heard in the\r\nvillage, save the dash of the cascade, and the murmuring of the silvery\r\nDor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPANY.\r\n\r\nWell: 'tis a motley assemblage this! The world is checkered here not\r\nless than in the noisy and elegant capital; and man's peculiarities,\r\nman's excellencies, and man's defects, follow him even into the heart of\r\nthese wild mountains, showing themselves in these smaller groups, not\r\nless strongly than amid the crowded streets of Paris! How should it be\r\notherwise? Does not every one come hither to unbend, to throw off the\r\nstiff mask of metropolitan society for the moment, and to become\r\nthemselves natural while they invoke the aid of nature's healthy\r\ninfluence? The strict etiquette of the Faubourg St Germain may here be\r\nsafely laid aside awhile; and the inspirations of country life, the\r\nhappy the delightful inspirations of youth, may be once more resumed.\r\nWhat a comfort to be able to get out of the buckram and taffetas of the\r\ncourt, to put on one's _neglige_, or one's shooting-jacket, and to keep\r\ncompany awhile with no less cheerful companions than the songsters and\r\nthe rangers of the forest! Why it does one's inmost soul good to fly\r\naway from the din and turmoil, even of the pleasure-seeking Parisians,\r\nand to revert to the simple, yet grand and expansive ideas which scenery\r\nsuch as this of Mont Dor brings into the mind in an instant.\r\n\r\nTrue: the mountains increase in magnitude and grandeur as you approach\r\nthem; once within their lofty and austere recesses, and their sublimity\r\nmakes itself felt. You are brought into immediate contact with some of\r\nthe mightiest works of the Creator, and the mind expands of itself,\r\nunconsciously and irresistibly, till it becomes capable of imbibing, of\r\ncomprehending, and of enjoying the full magnificence of nature!\r\n\r\nBut does the courtier, does the citizen lay aside his pack of habits, as\r\nwell as his pack of cares, when he becomes a temporary denizen of the\r\ncountry? Would that it were so! He is cast in a mould--his mind has been\r\nwarped: his body requires moistening with the freshest and the earliest\r\ndews of many an \"incense-breathing morn,\" ere it can resume the full\r\nelasticity and joyous lightness of rustic activity; and his soul wants a\r\nlong oblivion of all conventional preoccupation, all trouble and all\r\nintrigue, ere it can recover the tone and temper of younger days.\r\n\r\nNow, I had been saying all this to myself, and should have gone on\r\nmoralising till the weary hour of noon, perhaps; but while I was\r\nleaning over the balustrade of my window, looking down into the Grande\r\nPlace----Oh yes, to be sure! there is a Grande Place at Mont\r\nDor-les-Bains, as well as at any other town, village, or city. Did you\r\never in your life hear or see any thing French to which the epithet of\r\n_Grand_ had not been, by some means or other, tacked on? From the _Grand\r\nMonarque_ at the head of the _Grande Armee_ of the _Grande Nation_, down\r\nto the _Grand limonadier_ of the _Grand Cafe_ of the _Grande Place_, it\r\nis all _Grand_. Oh, this villanous spirit of exaggeration! this attempt\r\nat the sublime so inevitably linked to the ridiculous!----Just so! I was\r\nleaning over the balustrade of my window, which, from the third story of\r\nthe hotel, \"gave,\" as they term it, into the Grande Place. Now it is one\r\nof the most delightful things imaginable, after you have indulged in\r\nyour morning's ablutions, and have produced that indefinable lilac tint\r\non your chin, which tells of easy shaving soap and a Rogers's true old\r\nEnglish razor, to don your shawl dressing-gown, and, having adjusted\r\nyour _bonnet grec_ towards the right side of your head, so as to allow\r\nthe glossy curl to escape and hang pendant on the left; when all this is\r\ndone, to \"light the brown cigar,\" to put yourself in an elegant\r\nreclining posture between your opening _jalousies_, and, with both\r\nelbows resting on the red velvet cushion that crowns the hard edge of\r\nthe balustrade, to puff forth light wreaths of blue vapour into the\r\nbalmy air, and to see the bathers come back from the baths. There you\r\nmay \"think down hours to moments:\" and so was it with myself; for I took\r\nmy post at my window by half-past six, and at nine I was still there.\r\nEvery now and then went forth my curling column; then my eye would catch\r\nthe glorious \"mountain-tops bathed in the golden light of morn;\" then I\r\nwould give a glance at sublunary things awhile, and speculate on the\r\nmoving animals below; then puff, and gaze, and speculate again; and all\r\nthat while be the happiest of men, in the absolute absence of any thing\r\nbut perfect idleness.\r\n\r\nYou may say what you please, but it does the mind good to think of\r\nnothing at times; to let the impressions of passing events glide through\r\nthe soul, and titillate the imagination, but to \"leave no trace behind.\"\r\nOh yes! this fairy dancing on the sands of life's dull shore, is very\r\npleasant occupation for a summer morn, and eke a summer eve. It is\r\npoetical, to say the least of it; and day-dreams may sometimes prove not\r\nless agreeable than those mysterious scenes of night, when the soul\r\nquits her corporeal shackles, and roams in pure fancy through the world\r\nof thought, seeing sights of beauty, and scenes of paradisaical\r\nsplendour, which the dull organs of bodily vision can never attain unto.\r\nWhy! the happiest portion of my life is that which I have passed in the\r\nland of dreams: one third of my existence has been spent there--and I\r\nhave friends, and well-known faces, and peaceful valleys, and bright\r\nstreams, and strains of ethereal music, which are still and ever vivid\r\nin my waking mind, but at night call me to themselves, and wrap me in a\r\nstate of enjoyment which certainly this poor weak body of mind never\r\ncould be capable of experiencing. I have positively new, altogether new\r\nand unheard-of ideas--I do not mean irrational ones, nor those\r\nphantasmagoric combinations that haunt the diseased brains of some\r\nwretched mortals--but reasonable, possible, natural ideas of form and\r\nsubstance, which I am persuaded have their types in some corner or other\r\nof the universe, and which it may perhaps be hereafter my too happy\r\ndestiny to witness, and to dwell amongst for ever and for aye. I would\r\nnot exchange my dreams for all the realities of----\r\n\r\n\"_Monsieur! veut-il dejeuner au salon?_\" said the slip-shod _garcon_ of\r\nthe hotel, tapping me on the shoulder. \"The company have all taken their\r\nseats, and I have kept a chair for Monsieur. Does Monsieur prefer\r\nBurgundy or claret? The _vin ordinaire_ is not sufferable: _au reste_,\r\nhere is the _carte_, and Monsieur has only to choose.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a reality, my friend, that I was not then exactly thinking of--but\r\nbreakfast I must, and will. But just tell me, for a minute, where these\r\npeople come from, that I see down in the Place there, at that\r\ncorner--the old gentleman in nankeen, with the green shade over his\r\neyes, and the fat little dame by his side; and those young ladies at the\r\ndoor of the large hotel opposite, and the spruce _militaire_ there at\r\nthe window, and that knot of men in long brown surtouts, one of whom is\r\ngesticulating so vehemently.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Excusez_, Monsieur, those _gentlemen_ are great politicians,\" (_grand_\r\nagain, thought I!) \"and one of them is deputy for the Department--M. de\r\nBeauparler: he has just been voting against the Ministry, sir; he is a\r\ngreat friend of M. Lafitte, sir; oh, sir! _c'est le plus grand orateur\r\nde notre pays!_ You ought to hear him, sir. As for the young ladies,\r\nsir, they are _les Demoiselles Leroy_: it was their father that you were\r\nremarking just now--the old gentleman--very short-sighted, sir--he is\r\nimmensely rich; _Pardi! que sais-je?_\" (here he shrugged up his\r\nshoulders to his ears,) \"they say he has 50,000 francs a-year!--_c'est\r\nassommant!_\" (here he shut his eyes and raised his nose at an angle of\r\nforty-five degrees.) \"_Quant aux demoiselles, elles sont_\"----(he was\r\nevidently at a loss for an expression; so he extended his first two\r\nfingers to his lips, closing tightly the others and his thumb, and then\r\nblew a kiss with them to the winds.)\r\n\r\nTap! tap! at the door. \"Pierre! are you coming down, then? they are\r\nasking for you every where!\" And the tightly girded, and somewhat\r\n_altius accincta, fille-de-chambre_--a spruce little black-eyed\r\n_Auvergnate_,--tripped into the room. \"_Excusez, milor!_ but Pierre is\r\nsuch a gossip!\" \"My good girl, I will detain neither Pierre nor\r\nyourself: give me my coat, dust my room well, and now show me to the\r\n_salle-a-manger_.\"\r\n\r\nAs good luck would have it, Pierre had placed a chair for me next to\r\nMadame de Mirepoix, her husband was on the other side of his\r\nlady,--'twas impossible to be in better company. Opposite to me was a\r\nvenerable white-haired mustached gentleman, evidently a military man,\r\nand next to me was a lady, some five-and-forty, or thereabouts, with a\r\nstrong Spanish cast of countenance and complexion, and her husband, a\r\nshort thick-necked apoplectic-looking man, by her side. The rest of the\r\ncompany, though various enough in their physiognomical aspect, were\r\nevidently persons of the upper ranks of society, and among them were\r\nseveral choice specimens of the best and oldest nobility of France. They\r\nseemed all to make one joyous family party, as if they had been\r\nrelations rather than strangers; every body was laughing and chatting\r\nwith his neighbour; they were plying their forks most vigorously, and\r\nthe noise and bustle was excessive.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of our baths?\" said my lovely neighbour; \"for of\r\ncourse you have already been immersed in, and have tasted the waters.\" I\r\nhumbly alleged the negative. \"Well! I declare this _phlegme Britannique_\r\nis insupportable. Why, sir, we were at the bath-house before six this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had I but known it, Madame\"----\r\n\r\n\"Ah, just so!\" said the little apoplectic gentleman leaning across his\r\nwife to me: \"_Monsieur est Anglais! c'est tres bien, c'est tres bien!_\r\nMonsieur, you do us great honour to come to visit this savage\r\nwilderness. But _voyez-vous_, you would have done much better to have\r\nstopped at Paris; there's nothing here, sir--absolutely nothing! What\r\nare these mountains? Bare rocks! forests, indeed, there are; but there\r\nare forests every where. Give me, sir, the Foret de Montmorency, even\r\nthe Bois de Boulogne; and for rocks, I wish for nothing better than the\r\nRocher de Cancale.\" (Here he rubbed his hands excessively, and looked\r\nround the table for a smile at the _bon-mot_.)\r\n\r\n\"M. Bouton will pardon me,\" observed the old officer, \"but if he had\r\ntravelled all over Europe as I have done, he would not wonder at the\r\ndesire to change an every-day scene for something new. When our _corps\r\nd'armee_ was traversing the Mont St Bernard, I assure you I never felt\r\nthe slightest regret at having quitted Paris:--we could have gone on to\r\nthe end of the world with the spirits we then were in. It was the same\r\nin the Pyrenees:--for more reasons than one I was extremely sorry when\r\nwe had to quit Pampeluna for Bayonne\"--and the old gentleman sighed, and\r\nlooked wistfully up at the ceiling, as though many a painful\r\nrecollection came across his mind at that moment.\r\n\r\n\"Which are the finer mountains sir,\" was my inquiry--\"the Pyrenees or\r\nthese of Auvergne?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can hardly draw a comparison between them,\" he replied. \"There is\r\nvast extent, width, and height in the Pyrenees, and a certain degree of\r\nsavage horror about them, which you do not feel even amidst the\r\nAlps:--they partake of the nature both of France and Spain:--they are\r\nunlike any mountains I know of. But for all this, sir, do not allow\r\nyourself to hold a poor opinion of these heights of Mont Dor: you will\r\nfind here scope and exercise for all your enthusiasm, all your love of\r\nthe picturesque. Are you fond of shooting and hunting?--well, then, if\r\nyou were to remain here during September and October, braving the early\r\nsnows which come upon these mountains even in autumn, you would have\r\nyour choice of all animals from the wolf to the _chevreuil_ and the\r\nhare, and of all birds from the eagle to the partridge. There are plenty\r\nof snipes on these hills.\"\r\n\r\n\"M. le Baron de Bretonville,\" said Madame Bouton, \"do not go to tempt\r\nthe English gentleman to any of your hare-brained expeditions: he is\r\ncome here to enjoy the baths:--he is a victim to the spleen; he must be\r\ndanced and talked and bathed into good health, and a little vivacity\r\nfirst of all. When we all leave the baths, we will give him permission\r\nto stop behind with you, and you may kill all the game you can find. At\r\npresent we want a cavalier for our expedition: there is Madame\r\nd'Arlincourt, and Madame de Tourzel, and the Duchesse de Vauvilliers,\r\nand Madame de Mirepoix there, on your right--why these ladies are all\r\nhere by themselves; they want a cavalier this very morning.\r\n_Figurez-vous_, Monsieur!\" and the lady turned towards me--\"we want\r\nsomebody to come and find our ponies for us, and to take care of our\r\nshawls, and to carry our books, and our stools, and positively, with the\r\nexception of two officers who are at the other hotel, I do not know whom\r\nto ask. We engage you, sir, for the whole of this very day: our\r\nhusbands\"----\r\n\r\n\"I thought, Madame, that these ladies were all alone here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!--our husbands, _ca va sans dire_!--but gentlemen of that kind do\r\nnothing else than play billiards all the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is only the young and the gallant,\" here interposed Madame de\r\nMirepoix \"that dare to face our forests.--You shall teach us all some\r\nEnglish as we ride along: I could give any thing to master your\r\nbarbarous language:--you have only one musical word in it--_moonlight_.\"\r\n\r\nNow, I know not what there was in the pronunciation of Madame de\r\nMirepoix, but though the word had never before entered into my\r\nimagination as any thing but one of the most commonplace of our\r\nvocabulary, there was a witchery in the sound as it flowed forth from\r\nher swelling lips that riveted my attention, and set my imagination on\r\nfire. 'Tis the same with French:--how refined and how mellow soever may\r\nbe the utterance of the most polished courtier of France, of the most\r\nlearned academician of the Institute, there is sometimes a rich pouting\r\nsound, a sort of velvety and oily intonation, that distinguishes the\r\nspeech of the women of high birth such as I never heard in any other\r\ncountry. It is not to be defined: but whoso has drunk in the golden\r\ntones of such a syren, will know what I mean. Moonlight! yes, 'tis a\r\npleasing word, by its signification and its associated ideas, if not by\r\nits own innate harmony: yes; I have learned the full influence and\r\nsweetness of moonlight, whether in the summer woodland or in the wintry\r\ncloister; true, there is both music and poetry, ay and something else,\r\nin moonlight.\r\n\r\n\"I agree to the thing, Madame la Marquise, if not to the sound; nothing\r\ncould be more beautiful than the latter as you have pronounced it,\r\nexcept the reality, amidst these mountains and these retired deep-green\r\nglades.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nous le verrons, peut-etre.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST.\r\n\r\nAll the great valleys that branch out from the sides of the volcanic\r\nchain of Auvergne were once, no doubt, filled with impenetrable forests:\r\ngloomy wildernesses, thick as those of American wilds, where scarcely\r\nthe light of the sun could penetrate, and tenanted only by the wolf,\r\nthe bear, the boar, and the stag. Now these forests have disappeared\r\nfrom the eastern and western skirts of the chain, and are to be found in\r\nprimitive luxuriance only in the centre, where civilisation and the\r\ndestroying step of man have not made their way. Here the original forest\r\nis still to be seen in all its pride; untouched, untrimmed, unheeded by\r\nman: full of all its sublime grandeur--solemn, vast, and mysterious as\r\nforests have ever been; sobering, soothing, and beautiful as forests\r\nwill ever be. In some of the valleys the trees are principally of the\r\ndeciduous kind; enormous oaks, and chestnuts, and beeches, filling up\r\nthe vacant space left by the granitic walls on either side: but in the\r\nhigher regions of the mountainous district, in the more hidden recesses\r\nof the hills, they are all of the silver-fir species, and they attain a\r\nluxuriance of growth not to be imagined but by those who have studied\r\nthis, the noblest of the whole tribe of pines. Here forests occur,\r\nleagues upon leagues in extent, filling up wide and winding valleys;\r\nrunning out upon the elevated plateaux of the mountains; and wrapping\r\nthe whole country in gloomy majesty. You may ride day after day through\r\nthese intricate sylvan scenes, and never cross the track of a human\r\nbeing: or you may emerge from the depth of the wood, at some unexpected\r\nturn of a valley, upon a delightful little farm or village in a green\r\nglade of welcome verdure; and you may there witness the extreme\r\nsimplicity of the hardy mountaineers. Still higher up on the hills, and\r\non the vast pasture grounds that reach up to their summits, along the\r\ngently descending plateaux, occurs the birch, luxuriating in the cold\r\nexposure of its habitation as though it were in Siberia instead of\r\nFrance: and ever and anon, whether high up or low down the sides of the\r\nhills, you will find the box and the juniper bushes flourishing in\r\nperennial perfection.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to see the enormous size to which the silver-fir will here\r\nattain. Sometimes this tree rises with the utmost regularity--sending\r\nout its branches at equal intervals, tier above tier--itself tapering\r\nupwards, and each circle of branches decreasing in diameter until a\r\nhundred and fifty feet are gained. The stems of some of these giants of\r\nthe forest are eighteen feet in circumference at the height of a man\r\nfrom the ground, and their lower branches would of themselves form trees\r\nsuch as many a trim and well-kept park could never boast of. At other\r\ntimes the original tree will have met with an accidental fracture when\r\nyoung, and after going up twenty or thirty feet from the ground, as an\r\nimmense wooden column, will throw out three or four other trees from its\r\nsummit, which will all shoot up parallel to each other into the air and\r\nform a little forest of themselves. Very frequently, however, it happens\r\nthat the tree has been contorted in its early growth, and then broken\r\nafterwards: in such cases it seems to have forgotten its nature\r\ncompletely, and to have gone mad in its spirit of increase; for it turns\r\nand forces itself into the strangest convolutions and intricacies of\r\nform. It becomes like a short stunted oak, or a thickly knotted thorn:\r\nor it might sometimes be mistaken for a willow, at others for a\r\ncedar--for any thing but one of the same species as the stately spire of\r\nwood that soars up into the heaven close by its side.\r\n\r\nWhen the tree becomes quite dead, blasted by lightning, or injured by\r\nthe attacks of animals at its base, it does not therefore lose all its\r\nbeauty; for it becomes immediately covered with a peculiar gray lichen\r\nof great length and luxuriance; occupying every branch and twig of the\r\ndead tree, and clothing it, as it were, with a second but a new kind of\r\nfoliage. This lichen will sometimes hang down from the branches in\r\nstrings of weeping vegetation to the length of five feet and more. You\r\nmay sometimes ride under the living tree where this parasitical foliage\r\nis mixed with the real covering of the boughs, forming the most\r\nanomalous, and yet the most picturesque of contrasts.\r\n\r\nIn forests of this kind, the undergrowth of brushwood of every variety\r\nis exceedingly abundant and beautiful: every woodland shrub is to be\r\nfound there--the hazel especially--and the thickets thereby formed are\r\nquite impenetrable. As the older and larger trees decay, they lose\r\ntheir footing in the soil, and fall in every variety of strange\r\nposition--presenting a picture of desolation, the effect of which is at\r\nfirst strange to the mind, and at last becomes even painful. But\r\nwherever a tree falls, there a luxuriant growth of moss succeeds: a\r\nlittle peat-bed forms itself underneath: generations after generations\r\nof mosses and watery plants succeed one another; and in time the\r\nprostrate trunk is entirely buried under a bright-green bed, soft as\r\ndown, but treacherous to the foot as a quicksand. Often may the wanderer\r\namid these wild glades think to throw himself on one of these inviting\r\ncouches; and, bounding on to it, he sinks five or six feet through moss\r\nand weed and dirty peat, till his descent is stopped by the skeleton of\r\nthe vast tree that lies beneath. Wild flowers grow all around: and every\r\nspot of ground that will produce them is covered in the summer season\r\nwith the tempting little red strawberry, or the wild raspberry, or the\r\nblushing rose. Above all, still keep peering, in solemn and interminable\r\narray, the vast monarchs of the wood, the stately and elegant\r\nsilver-firs.\r\n\r\nWhen you attempt to leave the forests and advance towards the upper\r\ngrounds, you commonly find yourself stopped by a precipitous wall of\r\nbasaltic columns, ranging from sixty to seventy feet in height in one\r\nunbroken shaft, and forming a vast barrier for miles and miles in\r\nlength. In some places, these gray basaltic walls come circling round,\r\nand constitute an immense natural theatre, sombre and grand as the\r\nforest itself. No sound is there heard save the dashing of a distant\r\ncascade, or the wind in deep symphony rushing through the slow-waving\r\ntops of the trees. Below is a carpet of the most lively green,\r\nvariegated with turfs of wild flowers and fruits--one of nature's\r\nsecret, yet choicest gardens. Through the midst trickles a silvery\r\nstream, coming you know not whence, but musical in its course, and soon\r\nlosing itself in the thick underwood that borders the spot all around.\r\nSuch is the Salle de Mirabeau--one of the loveliest of the many lovely\r\nhiding-places of these sublime forests.\r\n\r\nThe feathered tenants of these woods are mostly birds of prey, or at all\r\nevents such as the raven, the jay, the pie, and others which can either\r\ndefend themselves against, or escape from, the falcons that consider\r\nthese solitudes as their own especial domains. The voices of few\r\nsinging-birds are to be heard; they have taken refuge nearer the\r\nhabitations of man: but the hooting of the owl, the beating of the\r\nwoodpecker, and the screaming of kites and hawks, are all the living\r\nsounds that proceed here from the air. Red-deer, wolves, wild-boars,\r\nroebucks, and foxes, are the denizens of these forests and these\r\nmountains: there is room here for them all to live at their ease; and\r\nthey abound. No one with a good barrel and a sure aim, ever entered\r\nthese forests in vain: his burden is commonly more than he can carry\r\nhome. It is in fact a glorious country for the sportsman; for the lower\r\nranges of the hills abound in hares, the cultivated grounds have plenty\r\nof partridges and quails, and the forests are tenanted as has been seen.\r\nHe who can content himself with his gun or his rod--for the streams are\r\nfull of trout--may here pass a golden age, without a thought for the\r\nmorrow, without a desire unfulfilled.\r\n\r\nCertainly, if I wished to retire from the world and lead a life of\r\nphilosophic indifference, not altogether out of the reach of society\r\nwhen I wanted it, these hills and these forests of Auvergne, and the\r\nMont Dor, would be the spots I should select. The mind here would become\r\nattuned to the grand harmonies of nature's own making; here, philosophy\r\nmight be cultivated in good earnest; here, books might be studied and\r\ntheories digested, without interruption and with inward profit. Here, a\r\nman might cultivate both science and art, and he might become again the\r\nfree and happy being which, until he betook himself to congregating in\r\ntowns, he was destined to be. Yes! when I do withdraw from this world's\r\nvanities and troubles, give me forests and mountains like those of Mont\r\nDor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHTING EIGHTY-EIGHTH.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pugnacity of Irishmen has grown into a proverb, until, in the belief\r\nof many, a genuine Milesian is never at peace but when fighting. With\r\ncertain nations, certain habits are inseparably associated as peculiarly\r\ncharacterising them. Thus, in vulgar apprehension, the Frenchman dances,\r\nthe German smokes, the Spaniard serenades; and on all hands it is agreed\r\nthat the Irishman fights. Naturally bellicose, his practice is\r\npugnacious: antagonism is his salient and distinctive quality. Born in a\r\nsquabble, he dies in a shindy: in his cradle he squeals a challenge; his\r\nlatest groan is a sound of defiance. Pike and pistol are manifest in his\r\nwell-developed bump of combativeness; his name is FIGHT, there can be no\r\nmistake about it. From highest to lowest--in the peer and the\r\nbog-trotter, the inherent propensity breaks forth, more or less modified\r\nby station and education.\r\n\r\nBe its expression parliamentary or popular, in Donnybrook or St\r\nStephen's, out it will. \"Show me the man who'll tread on my coat!\"\r\nshouts ragged Pat, flourishing his shillelagh as he hurls his\r\ndilapidated garment on the shebeen-house floor. From his seat in the\r\nsenate, a joint of the \"Tail\" intimates, in more polished but equally\r\nintelligible phrase, his inclination for a turn upon the turf. Wherever\r\nblows are rife, Hibernia's sons appear; in big fights or little wars the\r\nshamrock gleams in the van. No matter the cloth, so long as the quarrel\r\nbe there. In Austrian white, or Spanish yellow, or Prussian blue,--even\r\nin the blood-coloured breeks of Gallia's legions, but especially, and\r\npreferred above all, in the \"old red rag\" of the British grenadier, have\r\nIrishmen displayed their valour. And on the list of heroes whom the\r\nGreen Isle has produced, a proud and prominent place is justly held by\r\nthat gallant corps, the Rangers of Connaught.\r\n\r\nThose of our civilian readers to whom the word \"Ranger\" is more\r\nsuggestive of bushes and kangaroos, or of London parks and princes of\r\nthe blood, than of parades and battle-fields, are referred to page 49 of\r\nthe Army List. They will there find something to the following effect:--\r\n\r\n    88th, CONNAUGHT RANGERS.\r\n\r\n    The Harp and Crown.\r\n\r\n    _\"Quis Separabit?\"_\r\n\r\n    The Sphinx, \"Egypt.\"\r\n    \"Talavera.\" \"Busaco.\"\r\n    \"Fuentes d'Onore.\"\r\n    \"Cindad Rodrigo.\"\r\n    \"Badajoz.\" \"Salamanca.\"\r\n    \"Vittoria.\"\r\n    \"Nivelle.\" \"Orthes.\"\r\n    \"Toulouse.\"\r\n    \"Peninsula.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a forest of well-won laurels in this dozen of names. They form\r\na proud blazon for any corps, and one that might satisfy the most\r\ncovetous of honour. But of all men in the world, old soldiers are the\r\nhardest to content. They are patented grumblers. Napoleon knew it, and\r\nchristened his _vieille garde_ his _grognards_: tough and true as steel,\r\nthey yet would have their growl. Now the lads of the Eighty-Eighth,\r\nhaving proved themselves better men even than the veteran guards of the\r\nCorsican corporal, also claim the grumbler's privilege, setting forth\r\nsundry griefs and grave causes of complaint. They are not allowed the\r\nword \"Pyrenees\" upon their colours, although, at the fight of that name,\r\nthey not only were present, but rendered good service:--whilst for\r\nWaterloo many a man got a medal who, during the whole battle, was scarce\r\nwithin boom of cannon. During more than four years of long marches,\r\nshort commons, severe hardships, and frequent fighting, the general\r\ncommanding the third division--the fighting division, as it was\r\ncalled--viewed the Connaughters with dislike, even stigmatised them as\r\nconfirmed marauders, and recommended none of their officers for\r\npromotion, although many greatly distinguished themselves, and\r\nsome,--the brave Mackie, at Ciudad Rodrigo, for instance--successfully\r\nled forlorn-hopes. Finally, passing over the old sore of non-decoration\r\nfor Peninsular services, since that, common to many regiments, is at\r\nlast about to be healed,--Mr Robinson, the biographer of Sir Thomas\r\nPicton, has dared, in order to vindicate the harsh and partial conduct\r\nof his hero, to cast dust upon the facings of the brave boys of\r\nConnaught. It need hardly be said that they have found defenders. Of\r\nthese, the most recent is Lieutenant Grattan, formerly an officer of the\r\nEighty-eighth, and who, after making a vigorous stand, in the pages of a\r\nmilitary periodical, against the calumniators of his old corps, has\r\nbrought up his reserves and come to its support in a book of his own.\r\nHis volumes, however, are not devoted to mere controversy. He has\r\nunderstood that he should best state the case, establish the merits, and\r\nconfound the enemies of his regiment, by a faithful narrative of his and\r\nits adventures, triumphs, and sufferings. Thus, whilst he has seized the\r\nopportunity to deal out some hard knocks to those who have blamed the\r\nconduct (none have ever impugned the courage) of the Connaught Rangers,\r\nhe has produced an entertaining book, thoroughly Irish in character,\r\nwhere the ludicrous and the horrible, the rollicking and the\r\nslaughtering, mingle and alternate. Even when most indignant, good\r\nhumour and a love of fun peep through his pages. His prologue or\r\npreamble, entitled \"An Answer to some attacks in Robinson's Life of\r\nPicton,\" although redolent of \"slugs in a sawpit,\" is full of the\r\nnational humour. \"Frequently,\" Mr Robinson has asserted, \"just before\r\ngoing into battle, it would be found, upon inspection, that one-half of\r\nthe Eighty-eighth regiment were without ammunition, having acquired a\r\npernicious habit of exchanging the cartridge for _aguardiente_, and\r\nsubstituting in their places pieces of wood, cut and coloured to\r\nresemble them.\" Such things have been heard of, even in very\r\nwell-regulated regiments, as the exchange of powder and ball for brandy\r\nand other creature comforts; but it is very unlikely that the practice\r\nshould have prevailed to any thing like the extent here set down, in a\r\nBritish army in active service and under Wellington's command, and the\r\nartfully prepared quaker-cartridges increase the improbability of the\r\nstatement. Lieutenant Grattan scouts the tale as a base fabrication,\r\nlashes out in fine style at its propagator, and claims great merit for\r\nthe officers who taught their men to beat the best troops in the world\r\nwith timber ammunition. He puts forward a more serious refutation by a\r\nstring of certificates from men and officers of all ranks who served\r\nwith him in the Peninsula, and who strenuously repel the charge as a\r\nmalignant calumny.\r\n\r\nIt was at the close of the campaign of 1809, that the historian of the\r\nConnaught Rangers, then a newly commissioned youngster, joined, within a\r\nmarch of Badajoz, the first battalion of his regiment. The palmy and\r\ntriumphant days of the British army in the Peninsula could then hardly\r\nbe said to have begun. True, they had had victories; the hard-earned one\r\nof Talavera had been gained only three months previously, but the\r\ngeneral aspect of things was gloomy and disheartening. The campaign had\r\nbeen one of much privation and fatigue; rations were insufficient,\r\nquarters unhealthy, and Wellington's little army, borne on the\r\nmuster-rolls as thirty thousand men, was diminished one-third by\r\ndisease. The Portuguese, who numbered nearly as many, were raw and\r\nuntried troops, scarce a man of whom had seen fire, and little reliance\r\ncould be placed upon them. In spite of Lord Wellington's judicious and\r\nreiterated warnings, the incompetent and conceited Spanish generals\r\nrisked repeated engagements, in which their armies--numerous enough, but\r\nill disciplined, ill armed, and half-starved--were crushed and\r\nexterminated. The French side of the medal presented a very different\r\npicture. Elated by their German victories, their swords yet red with\r\nAustrian blood, Napoleon's best troops and ablest marshals hurried\r\nsouthwards, sanguinely anticipating, upon the fields of the Peninsula,\r\nan easy continuation of their recent triumphs. Three hundred and sixty\r\nthousand men-at-arms--French, Germans, Italians, Poles, even\r\nMamelukes--spread themselves over Spain, occupied her towns, and\r\ninvested her fortresses. Ninety thousand soldiers, under Massena,\r\n\"_l'enfant cheri de la Victoire_,\" composed the so-called \"army of\r\nPortugal,\" intended to expel from that country, if not to annihilate,\r\nthe English leader and his small but resolute band, who, undismayed,\r\nawaited the coming storm. In the ever-memorable lines of Torres Vedras,\r\nthe legions of Buonaparte met a stern and effectual dike to their\r\ntorrent of headlong aggression. Upon the happy selection and able\r\ndefence of those celebrated positions, were based the salvation of the\r\nPeninsula and the subsequent glorious progress of the British arms.\r\nWhilst referring to them, Mr Grattan seizes the opportunity to enumerate\r\nthe services rendered by the army in Spain. \"The invincible men,\" he\r\nsays, \"who defended those lines, aided no doubt by Portuguese and\r\nSpanish soldiers, afterwards fought for a period of four years, during\r\nwhich time they never suffered one defeat; and from the first\r\ncommencement of this gigantic war to its final and victorious\r\ntermination, the Peninsular army fought and won nineteen pitched\r\nbattles, and innumerable combats; they made or sustained ten sieges,\r\ntook four great fortresses, twice expelled the French from Portugal,\r\npreserved Alicant, Carthagena, Cadiz, and Lisbon; they killed, wounded,\r\nand took about _two hundred thousand enemies_, and the bones of forty\r\nthousand British soldiers lie scattered on the plains and mountains of\r\nthe Peninsula.\" And thereupon our friend, the Connaughter, bursts out\r\ninto indignation that warriors who did such deeds, and, on _fifteen_\r\ndifferent occasions received the thanks of parliament, should have been\r\ndenied a medal for their services. Certainly, when men who went through\r\nthe whole, or the greater part, of those terrible campaigns, which they\r\nbegan as commissioned officers, are now seen holding no higher than a\r\nlieutenant's rank, one cannot but recognise their title to some\r\nadditional recompense, and marvel that the modest and well-merited badge\r\nthey claim should so long have been refused them. Mr Grattan puts much\r\nof the blame of such refusal at the door of the Duke of Wellington. Not\r\nthat he is usually a depreciator of his former leader, of whose military\r\ngenius and great achievements he ever speaks with respect amounting to\r\nveneration. But he does not hesitate to accuse him of having sacrificed\r\nhis old followers and friends to his own vanity, which petty feeling, he\r\nmaintains, made the Duke desire that the only medal granted for the war\r\nagainst Napoleon, should be given for the only victory in which he beat\r\nthe Emperor in person. We believe that many Peninsular officers, puzzled\r\nto account for the constant and seemingly causeless refusal of the\r\ncoveted decoration, hold the same opinion with Mr Grattan. We esteem it\r\nrather plausible than sound. The names Of WELLINGTON and WATERLOO would\r\nnot the less be immortally associated because a cross bearing those of\r\nPENINSULA and PYRENEES, or any other appropriate legend, shone upon the\r\nbreasts of that \"old Spanish infantry,\" of whom the Duke always spoke\r\nwith affection and esteem, and to whom he unquestionably is mainly\r\nindebted for the wealth, honours, and fame which, for more than thirty\r\nyears, he has tranquilly enjoyed. Moreover, we cannot credit such\r\nselfishness on the part of such a man, or believe that he, to whom a\r\ngrateful sovereign and country decerned every recompense in their power\r\nto bestow, would be so thankless to the men to whose sweat and blood he\r\nmainly owed his success--to men who bore him, it may truly be said, upon\r\ntheir shoulders, to the highest pinnacle of greatness a British subject\r\ncan possibly attain. Waterloo concluded the war: its results were\r\nimmense, the conduct of the troops engaged heroic; but when we compare\r\nthe amount of glory there gained with the renown accumulated during six\r\nyears' warfare--a renown undimmed by a single reverse;--still more, when\r\nwe contrast the dangers and hardships of one short campaign, however\r\nbrilliant, with those of half-a-dozen long ones crowded with battles and\r\nsieges, we must admit that if the victors of La Belle Alliance nobly\r\nearned their medal, the veterans of Salamanca and Badajoz, Vittoria and\r\nToulouse, have a threefold claim to a similar reward. They have long\r\nbeen unjustly deprived of it, and now comparatively few remain to\r\nreceive the tardily-accorded distinction.\r\n\r\nThe first action to which Mr Grattan refers, as having himself taken\r\nshare in, is that of Busaco. The name is familiar to every body, but\r\nyet, of all the Peninsular battles, it is perhaps the one of which least\r\nis generally known. It was not a very bloody fight--the loss in killed\r\nand wounded having been barely seven per cent of the numbers engaged;\r\nstill it was a highly important one, as testing the quality of the\r\nPortuguese levies, upon which much depended. Upon the whole, they\r\nbehaved pretty well, although they committed one or two awkward\r\nblunders, and one of their militia regiments took to flight at the first\r\nvolley fired by their own friends. Mr Grattan does not usually set\r\nhimself up as a historical authority with respect to battles, except in\r\nmatters pertaining to his own regiment or brigade, and which came under\r\nhis own observation. Nevertheless, concerning Busaco, he speaks boldly\r\nout, and asserts his belief that no correct report of the action exists\r\nin print. Napier derives his account of it from Colonel Waller, whose\r\nstatement is totally incorrect, and has been expressly contradicted by\r\nvarious officers (amongst others, by General King) who fought that day\r\nwith Picton's division. Colonel Napier's strong partiality to the light\r\ndivision sometimes prevents his doing full justice to other portions of\r\nthe army. In this instance, however, any error he has fallen into,\r\narises from his being misinformed. He himself was far away to the left,\r\nfighting with his own corps, and could know nothing, from personal\r\nobservation, of the proceedings of Picton's men. Opposed to a very\r\nsuperior force, including some of the best regiments of the whole French\r\narmy, they had their hands full; and the Eighty-eighth, especially,\r\ncovered themselves with glory. At one time, the Rangers had not only the\r\nFrench fire to endure, but also that of the Eighth Portuguese, whose\r\nill-directed volleys crossed their line of march. An officer sent to\r\nwarn the Senhores of the mischief they did, received, before he could\r\nfulfil his mission, a French and a Portuguese bullet, and the Eighth\r\ncontinued their reckless discharge. But no cross-fire could daunt the\r\nmen of Connaught. \"Push home to the muzzle!\" was the word of their\r\ngallant lieutenant-colonel, Wallace; and push home they did, totally\r\nrouting their opponents, and nearly destroying the French Thirty-sixth,\r\na pet battalion of the Emperor's. Stimulus was not wanting; Wellington\r\nstood by, and, with his staff and several generals, watched the charge.\r\nThe Eighty-eighth were greatly outnumbered, and Marshal Beresford, their\r\ncolonel, \"expressed some uneasiness when he saw his regiment about to\r\nplunge into this unequal contest. But when they were mixed with\r\nRegnier's division, and putting them to flight down the hill, Lord\r\nWellington, tapping Beresford on the shoulder, said to him, 'Well\r\nBeresford, look at them now!'\" And when the work was done, and the fight\r\nover, Wellington rode up to Colonel Wallace, and seizing him warmly by\r\nthe hand, said, \"Wallace, I never witnessed a more gallant charge than\r\nthat made by your regiment!\" Beresford spoke to several of the men by\r\nname, and shook the officers' hands; and even Picton forgot his\r\nprejudice against the regiment, whom he had once designated as the\r\n\"Connaught foot-pads,\" and expressed himself satisfied with their\r\nconduct. Many of the men shed tears of joy. So susceptible are soldiers\r\nto praise and kindness, and so easy is it by a few well-timed words to\r\nrepay their toils and perils, and renew their store of confidence and\r\nhope. And numerous were the occasions during the Peninsular contest when\r\nthey needed all the encouragement that could be given them. After\r\nBusaco, when blockaded in the lines of Torres Vedras, their situation\r\nwas far from agreeable. The wet season set in, and their huts, roofed\r\nwith heather--a pleasant shelter when the sun shone, but very\r\nineffectual to resist autumnal rains--became untenable. Every device was\r\nresorted to for the exclusion of the deluge, but in vain. Fortunately,\r\nthe French were in a still worse plight. In miserable cantonments, short\r\nof provisions and attacked by disease, the horses died, and the men\r\ndeserted; until, on the 14th November, Massena broke up his camp, and\r\nretired upon Santarem. The Anglo-Portuguese army made a corresponding\r\nmovement into more comfortable quarters, and rumours were abroad of an\r\napproaching engagement; but it did not take place, and a period of\r\ncomparative relaxation succeeded one of severe hardship and arduous\r\nduty. Men and officers made the most of the holiday. There was never any\r\nthing of the martinet about the Duke. He was not the man to harass with\r\nunnecessary and vexations drills, or rigidly to enforce unimportant\r\nrules. Those persons, whether military or otherwise, who consider a\r\nstrictly regulation uniform as essential to the composition of a British\r\nsoldier, as a stout heart and a strong arm, and who stickle for a\r\nclosely buttoned jacket, a stiff stock, and the due allowance of\r\npipe-clay, would have been somewhat scandalised, could they have beheld\r\nthe equipment of Wellington's army in the Peninsula. Mr Grattan gives a\r\ncomical account of the various fantastical fashions and conceits\r\nprevalent amongst the officers. \"Provided,\" he says, \"we brought our men\r\ninto the field well-appointed, and with sixty rounds of good ammunition\r\neach, he (the Duke) never looked to see whether their trousers were\r\nblack, blue, or grey; and as to ourselves, we might be rigged out in all\r\nthe colours of the rainbow, if we fancied it.\" The officers, especially\r\nthe young subs, availed themselves largely of this judicious laxity, and\r\nthe result was a medley of costume, rather picturesque than military.\r\nBraided coats, long hair, plumed hats, and large mustaches, were amongst\r\nthe least of the eccentricities displayed. In a curious spirit of\r\ncontradiction, the infantry adopted brass spurs, anticipatory, perhaps,\r\nof their promotion to field-officers' rank; and, bearing in mind, that\r\n\"there is nothing like leather,\" exhibited themselves in ponderous\r\nover-alls, _a la Hongroise_, topped and strapped, and loaded down the\r\nside with buttons and chains. One man, in his rage for singularity, took\r\nthe tonsure, shaving the hair off the crown of his head; and another,\r\nhaving covered his frock-coat with gold tags and lace, was furiously\r\nassaulted by a party of Portuguese sharpshooters, who, seeing him, in\r\nthe midst of the enemy's riflemen, whither his headlong courage had led\r\nhim, mistook him for a French general, and insisted upon making him\r\nprisoner. And three years later, when Mr Grattan and a party of his\r\ncomrades landed in England, in all the glories of velvet waistcoats,\r\ndangling Spanish buttons of gold and silver, and forage caps of fabulous\r\nmagnificence, they could hardly fancy that they belonged to the same\r\nservice as the red-coated, white-breeched, black-gaitered gentlemen of\r\nPortsmouth garrison.\r\n\r\nThe embarkation of the British army, which in the summer of 1810 was\r\ndeemed imminent both in England and the Peninsula and considered\r\nprobable by Lord Liverpool himself, was no longer thought of after\r\nBusaco, save by a few of those croaking gentlemen, who, in camps as in\r\ncouncil-houses, view every thing through smoked spectacles.\r\nReinforcements, both English and Spanish, reached the lines of Torres\r\nVedras, which Wellington continued to strengthen, and Massena dared not\r\nattack. The accession of General Drouet's corps increased the army of\r\nthe Prince of Essling to upwards of 70,000 men. His cavalry, too, was\r\ntwice as strong as that of the British; but, notwithstanding this\r\nsuperiority, and the desire which he must have felt to retrieve his\r\nfame, tarnished by the repulse at Busaco, and by his fruitless movement\r\non the lines of Lisbon, Massena remained inert, in front of the man whom\r\nNapoleon's _Moniteur_ contemptuously designated as the \"Sepoy General.\"\r\nSpring approached without either army assuming the offensive, until, on\r\nthe 5th of March 1811, the French began their retreat from Portugal,\r\nclosely followed up by Wellington. There was little difficulty in\r\ntracing them: they left a broad trail of blood, and desolation. With\r\nbare blade, and blazing brand, they swept across the land; church and\r\nconvent, town and village, the farm and the cottage, were given to the\r\nflames; on the most frivolous pretexts, often without one, women,\r\nchildren, and unarmed men were barbarously murdered; and many a\r\nPortuguese lost his life for refusing to point out treasures which\r\nexisted only in the imagination of the fierce and greedy Frenchman.\r\nEnraged at the dearth of provisions, of which they stood in great need,\r\nand which had been every-where removed or destroyed, the retreating army\r\nabandoned themselves to frightful cruelties and excesses. All along the\r\nline of march, the pursuers found piles of bodies, groups of murdered\r\npeasantry, and, mingled with them, the corpses of Frenchmen, often\r\nhideously mutilated, according to the barbarous usage which has been\r\ncontinued in more recent wars by the vindictive population of the\r\nPeninsula. The retaliation was terrible, but the provocation had been\r\nextreme. Mr Grattan's details of some of the scenes he himself\r\nwitnessed, are painfully minute and vivid; and whilst reading them, we\r\ncease to wonder that, after the lapse of a third of a century, hatred of\r\nthe French exists almost undiminished in the countries they so cruelly\r\nand wantonly ravaged.\r\n\r\nHowever orderly and well-conducted, there is always something\r\ndiscouraging in a retreat, as there is a cheerful and exhilarating\r\nfeeling attendant on an advance. Nevertheless, during their progress\r\nacross Portugal, the French maintained their high reputation. Their\r\nrear-guard, commanded by Marshal Ney, made good fight when pressed by\r\nthe British, but their losses were heavy before they reached the Spanish\r\nfrontier. This they crossed early in April, and a month later they had\r\nto recross it, to convey supplies to the fortress of Almeida, the only\r\nplace in Portugal over which the tricolor still floated. The result of\r\nthis movement was the bloody combat of Fuentes d'Onore, a complete but\r\ndearly-bought triumph for our arms. Here the Eighty-eighth nobly\r\ndistinguished themselves. At first they were in reserve, whilst for\r\neight hours two Highland regiments, the Eighty-third and some light\r\ncompanies, fought desperately in the town, opposed to the fresh troops\r\nwhich Massena continually sent up. Their loss was very heavy, the\r\nstreets were heaped with dead, the heat was excessive, and ammunition\r\ngrew scarce. The Highlanders and the French grenadiers fought in the\r\ncemetery, across the graves and tombstones. \"Wallace, with his regiment,\r\nthe Eighty-eighth, was in reserve on the high ground which overlooked\r\nthe churchyard, and was attentively viewing the combat which raged\r\nbelow, when Sir Edward Pakenham galloped up to him, and said, 'Do you\r\nsee that, Wallace?'--'I do,' replied the colonel; 'and I would rather\r\ndrive the French out of the town than cover a retreat across the\r\nCoa.'--'Perhaps,' said Sir Edward, 'his lordship don't think it\r\ntenable.' Wallace answering, said, 'I shall take it with my regiment,\r\nand keep it too.'--'Will you?' was the reply; 'I'll go and tell Lord\r\nWellington so.' In a moment or two, Pakenham returned at a gallop, and\r\nwaving his hat, called out, 'He says you may go.--Come along, Wallace!'\"\r\n\r\nPoor Pakenham! ever foremost to lead a charge or brave a peril. He\r\ndeserved a better fate, after his glorious exploits in the Peninsula,\r\nthan to be picked off by a sneaking Yankee rifle, in the swampy plains\r\nof New Orleans. But the same \"boiling spirit and hasty temper\" that won\r\nhim laurels in Europe, led him to his death in another hemisphere.\r\nOver-confidence may be pardoned in a man who had so often driven before\r\nhim the redoubtable cohorts of the modern Alexander. And one mistake\r\ncannot obliterate the memory of fifty gallant feats.--Full of fight, and\r\nled on by Pakenham, Mackinnon, and Wallace, the Eighty-eighth advanced\r\nat a smart trot into the town, where the French Ninth regiment and a few\r\nhundreds of the Imperial Guard awaited them. Their charge was\r\nirresistible; they cleared the place and drove the enemy into the river.\r\nThey even pursued them through it, and several Rangers fell on the\r\nFrench side of the stream. About a hundred and fifty of the Old Guard\r\nran into a street, of which the further end was barricaded. Mr Grattan,\r\nwhose account of the affair is a graphic and interesting piece of\r\nmilitary narrative, is amusingly cool and _naif_ in referring to this\r\nincident. \"Mistakes of this kind,\" he says, \"will sometimes occur, and\r\nwhen they do, the result is easily imagined.... In the present instance,\r\nevery man was put to death; but our soldiers, _as soon as they had\r\nleisure_, paid the enemy that respect which is due to brave men.\" We\r\napprehend that, with the Connaughters, _leisure_, in this sense, was\r\nscanty, at least at Fuentes d'Onore; but, in so close and desperate a\r\nfight, hot blood is apt to drown mercy. The dashing charge of the\r\nEighty-eighth nearly closed the day's performances, although the French\r\nbatteries, admirably served, still peppered the town. Men and officers\r\nsheltered themselves as well as they could, but many were killed; whilst\r\nPakenham, with reckless bravery, rode about the streets, a mark for the\r\nenemy's shot, which tore up the ground around him whenever he stood\r\nstill. \"He was in a violent perspiration and covered with dust, his left\r\nhand bound round with a handkerchief, as if he had been wounded; he was\r\never in the hottest of the fire: and, if the whole fate of the battle\r\nhad depended on his exertions, he could not have fought with more\r\ndevotion.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the many daring acts witnessed on the bloody day of Fuentes\r\nd'Onore, that of the Spanish guerilla chief, Julian Sanchez, deserves\r\nnotice. At the head of his ragged and ill-disciplined band, he had the\r\ntemerity to charge a crack French regiment, and, as might be expected,\r\nwas sent back with a sore head. Whilst on the subject of guerillas, Mr\r\nGrattan combats an opinion which he believes many persons in this\r\ncountry entertain, \"that the Spaniards and Portuguese did as much, if\r\nnot more, during the Peninsular contest, than the British.\" Here he is\r\ncertainly mistaken. Very few persons, out of the Peninsula, have any\r\nsuch notion. The French know well enough by whom they were beaten. Loth\r\nas they are to acknowledge a thrashing at the hands of their old\r\nantagonists, they do not dream of attributing their defeats to the\r\n\"_brigands_,\" of whom they declare they would have had a very cheap\r\nbargain, but for the intervention of the troublesome English. And\r\ncertainly, if the Spaniards and Portuguese had been left to themselves,\r\nalthough, favoured by the mountainous configuration of the country, they\r\nmight long have kept up a desultory contest, they would never have\r\nsucceeded in expelling the invaders; for the simple reason that they\r\nwere wholly unable to meet them in the plain. Most true it is that,\r\nduring the war of independence, the people of the Peninsula gave\r\nnumerous examples of bravery and devotion, and still more of long\r\nsuffering and patient endurance for their country's sake. The irregular\r\nmode of warfare adopted by the peasantry, the great activity and\r\nconstant skirmishings, stratagems, and ambuscades of Mina, the\r\nEmpecinado, Sanchez, and many other patriotic and valiant men, greatly\r\nharassed and annoyed the French; and, by compelling them to employ large\r\nbodies of troops in garrison and escort duty, prevented their opposing\r\nan overwhelming force to the comparatively small army under Wellington.\r\nBut all that sort of thing, however useful and efficacious as a general\r\nsystem, and as weakening the enemy, was very petty work when examined in\r\ndetail. The great victories, the mighty feats of war that figure in\r\nhistory's page, were due to British discipline, pluck, and generalship.\r\nAnd whatever merit remains with the Spaniards, is to be attributed to\r\ntheir guerillas and irregular partisans. As to their regular troops,\r\nafter they had overthrown Dupont at Baylen, they seemed to think they\r\nmight doze upon their laurels, which were very soon wrenched from them.\r\nBaylen was their grand triumph, and subsequently to it they did little\r\nin the field. Behind stone walls they still fought well: Spaniards are\r\nbrave and tenacious in a fortress, and Saragossa is a proud name in\r\ntheir annals. Nothing could be better than old General Herrasti's\r\nvaliant defence of Cuidad Rodrigo against Ney and his thirty thousand\r\nFrenchmen. The garrison, six thousand strong, lost seven hundred men by\r\nthe first day's fire. Only when their guns were silenced, when the town\r\nwas on fire in various places, and when several yards of wall were\r\nthrown down by a mine, did the brave governor hoist the white flag.\r\nOther instances of the kind might be cited, when Spanish soldiers fought\r\nas well as mortal men could do. But with respect to pitched battles,\r\nanother tale must be told. At Ocana, Almonacid, and on a dozen other\r\ndisastrous fields, Baylen was amply revenged. The loss at Ocana alone is\r\nrated by Spanish accounts at thirty thousand men, chiefly prisoners. Mr\r\nGrattan estimates it at twenty-five thousand men, and _thirteen thousand\r\neight hundred and seventy-seven guitars_. Of these latter, he tells us\r\ntwelve thousand seven hundred and fifty-two were in cases, and the\r\nremainder without; Indeed he is so exceedingly circumstantial that we\r\npresume he counted them himself. Otherwise, although well aware of the\r\nSpaniard's predilection for the fascinating tinkle of his national\r\ninstrument, we could hardly credit the accuracy of the figures. Even a\r\n_Spanish_ general, we should think, would hardly allow his men thus to\r\nencumber themselves with harmony. The march of such an army of\r\nOrpheuses, in which every third soldier shouldered a fiddle-case as a\r\npendant to his musket, must have been curious to behold; suggesting the\r\nidea that the melodious warriors designed subduing their foes by the\r\nsoothing strains of _jotas_ and _cachuchas_, rather than by the more\r\ncogent arguments of sharp steel and ball-cartridge. Great must have been\r\nthe tinkling at eventide, exceeding that of the most extensive flock of\r\nmerinos that ever cropped Castilian herbage. Was it because they were\r\ncertain of a dance that these barrack-yard minstrels came provided with\r\nmusic, sure, in any case, to have the piper to pay? If the instruments\r\nwere provided to celebrate a triumph, they might as well have been left\r\nat home. In Spain, however, time has effaced, or greatly weakened, the\r\nremembrance of many reverses, whilst slight and dubious successes,\r\ncarefully treasured up, have swollen by the keeping into mighty\r\nvictories; and at the present day, foreigners who should be so\r\nuncourteous and impolitic as to express, in the hearing of Spaniards, a\r\ndoubt that Spanish valour was the main agent in driving the French from\r\nthe Peninsula, might reckon, not on a stab--knifeing being less in vogue\r\nbeyond the Bay of Biscay than is often imagined--but certainly on a\r\nscowl, and probably on an angry contradiction. And in every province,\r\nalmost in every town, in Spain the traveller may, if he so pleaseth, be\r\nregaled with marvellous narratives of signal victories, gained over the\r\n_gavachos_, in that immediate neighbourhood, by valiant generals whose\r\nnames, so partial is fame, have never transpired beyond the scenes of\r\ntheir problematical exploits. Under the constitutional system, and owing\r\nto the long civil war, Spanish troops have improved in discipline and in\r\nvarious other respects; and with good generals, there is no manifest\r\nreason why they should not successfully cope with Frenchmen, although we\r\ndoubt whether they could. But in Napoleon's day matters were very\r\ndifferent, and in the open field their chance was desperate. The\r\nPortuguese were doubtless of a better quality; and in the pages of\r\nNapier and other historians, we find them spoken of in terms of praise.\r\nThey had British officers to head them, and there is much in good\r\nleading; they had British troops to emulate, and national pride spurred\r\nthem on. At the same period, Italians--certainly very poor soldiers when\r\nleft to themselves--fought gallantly under French generals, and with\r\nFrench example before them. Of the general bearing of the Portuguese,\r\nhowever, we have heard few Peninsular men speak very highly. They appear\r\nto have been extremely inconsistent; brave one day, dastards the next.\r\n\r\nAt, Ciudad Rodrigo, Mr Grattan greatly lauds their gallantry, which\r\nstruck him the more as being unexpected. At Salamanca, on the other\r\nhand, he records their weakness, and the easy repulse of Pack's brigade,\r\ntwo thousand strong, by four hundred Frenchmen. \"Notwithstanding all\r\nthat has been said and written of the Portuguese troops, I still hold\r\nthe opinion that they are utterly incompetent to stand unsupported and\r\n_countenanced_ by British troops, with any chance of success, against\r\neven half their own numbers of Frenchmen.\" Again, after Salamanca, when\r\nWellington and his victorious army advanced on Madrid, the Portuguese\r\ndragoons fled, without striking a blow, before the French lancers,\r\nexposing the reserve of German cavalry to severe loss, abandoning the\r\nartillery to its fate, and tarnishing the triumphal entry of the British\r\ninto the capital--within a march of which this disgraceful affair\r\noccurred. Still, to encourage these wavering heroes, it was necessary to\r\nspeak civilly of them in despatches; to pat them on the back, and tell\r\nthem they were fine fellows. And this has sometimes been misunderstood\r\nby simple persons, who believe all they see in print, and look upon\r\ndespatches and bulletins as essentially veracious documents. \"I remember\r\nonce,\" says Mr Grattan, \"upon my return home in 1813, getting myself\r\nclosely cross-examined by an old lawyer, because I said I thought the\r\nPortuguese troops inferior to the French, still more to the British.\r\n'Inferior to the British, sir! I have read Lord Wellington's last\r\ndespatch, and he says the Portuguese fought as well as the British; and\r\nI suppose you won't contradict him?' I saw it was vain to convince this\r\npugnacious old man of the necessity of saying these civil things, and we\r\nparted mutually dissatisfied with each other; he taking me, no doubt,\r\nfor a forward young puppy, and I looking upon him as a monstrous old\r\nbore.\"\r\n\r\nThe Eighty-eighth, we gather from Mr Grattan's narrative, whilst\r\nrespected by all as a first-rate battle regiment, was, when the stirring\r\nand serious events of that busy time left a moment for trifling, a\r\nfertile source of amusement to the whole third division. This is not\r\nwonderful. Many of the officers, and all the men, with the exception of\r\nthree or four, were Irish, not Anglicised Irishmen, tamed by long\r\nresidence amongst the Saxon, but raw, roaring Patlanders, who had grown\r\nand thriven on praties and potheen, and had carried with them to Spain\r\ntheir rich brogue, their bulls, and an exhaustless stock of gaiety. The\r\namount of fun and blunders furnished by such a corps was naturally\r\nimmense. But if in quarters they were made the subject of much\r\ngood-humoured quizzing, in the field their steady valour was justly\r\nappreciated. No regiment in the service contained a larger proportion of\r\n\"lads that weren't aisy,\" which metaphorical phrase, current among the\r\nRangers, is translated by Mr Grattan as signifying fellows who would\r\nwalk into a cannon's month, and think the operation rather a pleasant\r\none. Whenever a desperate service was to be done, \"the boys,\" as they,\r\n_more Hibernico_, familiarly termed themselves, were foremost in the\r\nranks of volunteers. The contempt of danger, or non-comprehension of it,\r\nmanifested by some of these gentlemen, was perfect. \"My fine fellow,\"\r\nsaid an engineer officer, during the unsuccessful siege of Badajoz in\r\nMay 1811, to a man under Lieutenant Grattan's orders, who sat outside a\r\nbattery, hammering at a fascine; \"my fine fellow, you are too much\r\nexposed; get inside the embrasure, and you will do your work nearly as\r\nwell.\" \"I'm almost finished, colonel,\" was the reply, \"and it isn't\r\nworth while to move now. Those fellows can't hit me, for they've been\r\ntrying it these fifteen minutes.\" Just then, a round-shot gave the lie\r\nto his prediction by cutting him in two; and, according to their custom,\r\nthe French gunners set up a shout of triumph at their successful\r\npractice. Some of the Connaughters, who had never lost sight of their\r\nnative bogs till exported to the Peninsula, understood little or no\r\nEnglish beyond the words of command. On an inspection parade, one of\r\nthis class was asked by General Mackinnon, to whose squad he belonged.\r\nBewildered and puzzled, Darby Rooney applied to his sergeant for a\r\ntranslation of the general's question--thus conveying to the latter an\r\nidea that this was the first time he had heard such a thing as a squad\r\nspoken of. The story got abroad--was, of course, much embellished--and\r\nan hour afterwards the third division was enjoying a prodigious chuckle\r\nat the notion that not one of the Connaughters knew what a squad meant.\r\nThe young men laughed, the old officers shook their heads and deplored\r\nthe benighted state of the Irishmen; whilst all the time, Mr Grattan\r\nassures us, \"the Eighty-eighth was a more really _efficient_ regiment\r\nthan almost any _two_ corps in the third division.\" As efficient as any\r\nthey undoubtedly were, when fighting was to be done; but in some other\r\nrespects their conduct was less irreproachable. According to their\r\nhistorian and advocate's own showing, their knapsacks were often too\r\nlight and their havresacks too heavy. \"A watchcoat, a piece of\r\npipe-clay, and a button-brush,\" compose rather a scanty kit: yet those\r\nthree articles formed--with the exception of the clothes he stood\r\nin--the entire wardrobe and means of personal adornment of the Rooney\r\nabove-named; and many of his comrades were scarce better provided. But\r\nif the back was neglected and left bare, the belly, on the contrary,\r\nwas cared for with vigilant affection. On occasion, the Eighty-eighth\r\ncould do their work on meagre diet as well, or better than any other\r\ncorps. They would march two days on a pipe of tobacco; or for a week,\r\nwith the addition of a biscuit and a dram. But when they did such\r\nthings, it was no sign of any abstract love of temperance, or wish to\r\nmortify the flesh; it was simply a token of the extreme poverty of the\r\ndistrict in which they found themselves. For the article provend they\r\nalways kept a bright look-out. A greasy havresack, especially on the\r\nline of march, is the soldier's first desideratum; and it was rare that\r\na very respectable workhouse soup could not have been produced by\r\ninfusing that of a Connaughter in a proper quantity of water. When\r\nrations were scanty, or commissaries lagged in the rear, none understood\r\nbetter than the Eighty-eighth how to forage for themselves. \"Every man\r\nhis own quartermaster\" was then their motto. Nothing came amiss to them;\r\nsweet or savoury, from a pig to a bee-hive, they sacked every thing; and\r\ntheir \"taking ways\" were often cast in their teeth. The natives were\r\ncompelled to mount guard over their sheepfolds; but the utmost force\r\nthey could muster was of small avail against the resolute onslaught of\r\nthe half-famished Irishmen. Even the exertions of the Provost-marshal,\r\nand the liberal application of the cat, proved ineffectual to check\r\nthese depredations; whilst the whimsical arguments used by the fellows\r\nin their defence sometimes disarmed the severity of Picton himself.\r\n\r\nIt would have been quite out of character for an Irish regiment to march\r\nwithout ladies in their train, and accordingly the female following of\r\nthe Rangers was organised on the most liberal scale. Motley as it was\r\nnumerous, it included, besides English and Irish women, a fair\r\nsprinkling of tender-hearted Spaniards and Portuguese, who had been\r\nunable to resist the fascinations of the insinuating Connaughters. The\r\nsufferings of these poor creatures, on long marches, over bad roads and\r\nin wet and cold seasons, were of course terrible, and only to be\r\nequalled by their fidelity to those to whom they had attached\r\nthemselves. Their endurance of fatigue was wonderful; their services\r\nwere often great; and many a soldier, stretched disabled on the field of\r\nsome bloody battle, and suffering from the terrible thirst attendant on\r\nwounds, owed his life to their gentle ministry. In circumstances of\r\ndanger, they showed remarkable courage. At the assault of Ciudad\r\nRodrigo, the baggage-guard, eager to share in the fight, deserted\r\ntheir post and rushed to the trenches. Immediately a host of\r\nmiscreants--fellows who hung on the skirts of the army, watching\r\nopportunities to plunder--made a dash at the camp, but the women\r\ndefended it valiantly, and fairly beat them off. Of course feminine\r\nsensibility got a little blunted by a life of this kind, and it was\r\nrarely with very violent emotion that the ladies saw their husbands go\r\ninto action. Persuaded of their invincibility, they looked upon success\r\nas certain, and if, unfortunately, the victory left them widows, they\r\ndeemed a very short mourning necessary before contracting a new\r\nalliance. Now and then a damsel of birth and breeding would desert the\r\npaternal mansion to follow the drum; and Mr Grattan tells a romantic\r\nhistory of a certain Jacinta Cherito, the beautiful daughter of a\r\nwealthy judge, who blacked her face and tramped off as a cymbal boy\r\nunder the protection of the drum-major of the Eighty-eighth--a\r\nmagnificent fellow, whose gorgeous uniform and imposing cocked hat\r\ncaused him to be taken by the Portuguese for nothing less than a general\r\nof division. The young lady had not forgotten to take her jewels with\r\nher, and the old judge made a great fuss, and appealed to the colonel,\r\nwho requested him to inspect the regiment as it left the town. But the\r\nsooty visage and uniform jacket baffled his penetration, and at the\r\nfirst halt, the drummer and the lady were made one flesh. Thorp, the\r\nlucky bridegroom, was a fine dashing fellow, bent upon distinguishing\r\nhimself. He was often wounded, but never missed an engagement, even when\r\nhis hurts were unhealed. He fell gloriously at Toulouse, and the next\r\nday came the gazette with his promotion to an ensigncy, which, if it was\r\nthen of little value to him, was at any rate \"a great consolation to his\r\npoor afflicted widow, and the means of reconciling her father to the\r\nchoice she had made; and her return once more to her home was a scene of\r\ngreat rejoicing.\" When the British troops embarked at Bordeaux, for\r\nAmerica and England, a crowd of poor Spanish and Portuguese women, who\r\nhad long followed their fortunes and were now forbidden to accompany\r\ntheir husbands and lovers, watched their departure with tearful eyes.\r\n\"They were fond and attached creatures, and had been useful in many\r\nways, and under many circumstances, not only to their husbands, but to\r\nthe corps they belonged to generally. Many of them, the Portuguese in\r\nparticular, had lived with our men for years, and had borne them\r\nchildren.\" But the stern rules of the service prevailed. The battalions\r\nbound for America were allowed but a limited number of soldiers' wives,\r\nand the surplus were of necessity left to their fate. Some had money;\r\nmore were penniless, and nearly naked. Men and officers were then\r\ngreatly in arrear, but nevertheless a subscription was got up, and its\r\namount divided amongst the unfortunates, thus abandoned upon a foreign\r\nshore, and at many hundreds of miles from their homes.\r\n\r\nGeneral Picton was a man of action, not of words. There was no palaver\r\nabout him, nothing superfluous in the way of orations, but he spoke\r\nstrongly and to the point. Long harangues, as Mr Grattan justly\r\nobserves, are not necessary to British soldiers. Metaphor and flowers of\r\nrhetoric are thrown away upon them. Something plain, pithy, and\r\nappropriate is what they like; the shorter the better. \"Rangers of\r\nConnaught!\" said Picton, as he passed the Eighty-eighth, drawn up for\r\nthe assault of Ciudad Rodrigo, \"it is not my intention to expend any\r\npowder this evening. We'll do this business with the cold iron.\" This\r\nwas a very unpretending speech; nothing of the clap-trap or melodramatic\r\nabout it; a mere declaration in the fewest possible words, of the\r\nspeaker's intentions, implying what he expected from those he addressed.\r\nThat it was just what was wanted, was proved by the hearty respondent\r\ncheer of the brave Irishmen. The result of the attack is well known; the\r\nRangers took a gallant share in it. The next morning the troops were\r\nordered out of the captured town, which they had ransacked to some\r\npurpose, and the Eighty-eighth, drawn up on their bivouac ground, were\r\nabout to march away to the village of Atalaya, when Picton again rode\r\npast. \"Some of the soldiers, who were more than usually elevated in\r\nspirits,\" (they had passed the night in bursting open doors and drinking\r\nbrandy,) \"called out, 'Well, General, we gave you a cheer last night:\r\nit's your turn now!' The general smiled, took off his hat, and said,\r\n'Here, then, you drunken set of brave rascals--hurrah! we'll soon be at\r\nBadajoz.'\" A prophecy which was not long unaccomplished. With all\r\ndeference to Mr Grattan, we cannot but think that the Eighty-eighth were\r\nvery appropriately placed under Picton's orders. Excellent fighting men\r\nthough they were, they certainly, according to their champion's own\r\nshowing, needed a strict hand over them. We should like to know how they\r\nwould have got on under such an officer as Mr Grattan tells us of, who,\r\nwhen in command of a regiment, came to mess one day in very low spirits,\r\nbecause, having sent his adjutant to inquire of an ensign why he did not\r\nattend parade, the ensign returned no answer, and, on subsequently\r\nmeeting his commanding officer, cut him dead. The colonel told the story\r\nat the mess-table, and concluded by saying, \"I thought nothing of his\r\nnot answering my message, but I cannot express how much I am hurt at the\r\nidea of his cutting me as he did when I wished to speak to him!\"\r\nField-officers of such susceptible feelings, and such very loose ideas\r\non the subject of discipline, were not plentiful in the Peninsula, and\r\nthis one, we are given to understand, did not long retain his regiment.\r\nHe would hardly have done at the head of the high-spirited Connaughters.\r\nBut if Picton's severity to the men of the Eighty-eighth may be\r\njustified, his neglect of the officers is far more difficult to excuse.\r\n\"_Not one of them was ever promoted through his recommendation._\" The\r\nconduct of Lieutenant Mackie at Ciudad Rodrigo was chivalrous in the\r\nextreme. General Mackinnon--who commanded the brigade and was blown to\r\npieces at its head by the explosion of a mine--wished to confer a mark\r\nof distinction on the gallant Eighty-eighth, and ordered that one of its\r\nsubalterns should lead the forlorn-hope. The moment this was announced\r\nto the assembled officers, \"Mackie stepped forward, and lowering his\r\nsword, said, 'Major Thompson, I am ready for that service.'\" Mackinnon\r\nhad promised a company to the forlorn-hope leader, if he survived. But\r\nit must be observed that Mackie was senior lieutenant, and consequently\r\nsure of early promotion. The Eighty-eighth was to be in the van at the\r\nassault, and the probabilities were that at least one captain would be\r\nknocked off. Or, if not that day, it would happen the next. So that\r\nMackie, in volunteering on the most desperate of all services, could\r\nhave little to actuate him beyond an honourable desire for glory. How\r\nwas he repaid? Gurwood, who led the forlorn-hope at the lesser breach,\r\ngot his company; Mackie remained a lieutenant--no captain of the\r\nEighty-eighth having been killed, and General Mackinnon not being alive\r\nto fulfil his promise. And whilst all the other officers who had been\r\nforward in the attack, had their names recorded in Picton's\r\ndivision-order, poor Mackie was denied even the word of barren praise so\r\ngratifying to a soldier's heart.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Ciudad Rodrigo was a stunning blow to the French. They could\r\nnot understand it at all. Herrasti and his Spaniards had held out the\r\nplace a month against Ney and Massena, with thirty or forty thousand\r\nveterans, and that in fine weather, a great advantage to the\r\nbesiegers--in eleven days, and in the depth of winter, Wellington\r\nreduced it, with twenty thousand men and opposed by a French garrison.\r\nThe contrast was great, and quite inexplicable to the French. \"On the\r\n16th,\" wrote Marmont to Berthier, \"the English batteries opened their\r\nfire at a great distance. On the 19th the place was taken by storm, and\r\nfell into the power of the enemy. There is something so incomprehensible\r\nin this event, that I allow myself no observation. I am not provided\r\nwith the requisite information.\" No testimony could be more\r\ncomplimentary to the brave captors of Rodrigo. That great success,\r\nhowever, was only a forerunner of greater ones. Badajoz was the next\r\nplace to be taken, preparatory to marching into the interior of Spain.\r\nTo conceal his intentions from the enemy, Wellington had recourse to an\r\nelaborate stratagem. A powerful battering train, supplied by the men of\r\nwar in the Tagus, was shipped at Lisbon, on board vessels of large size,\r\nwhich put out to sea, and, when out of sight of land, transhipped their\r\ncargo into smaller craft. These carried them up the Tagus into the heart\r\nof the country. At the same time the necessary magazines were formed;\r\nand at Elvas, only three leagues from Badajoz, a large quantity of\r\nfascines and gabions were prepared. All this, however, was done so\r\nquietly, Wellington appeared so supine, and Badajoz was so well\r\nprovided, that Soult was lulled into security; and when at last he took\r\nthe alarm, and marched from Seville at the head of twenty-five thousand\r\nmen, it was too late. Philippon, and his brave garrison, did all that\r\nskill and courage could; but in vain. When Soult reached Villafranca,\r\ntwo days' march from Badajoz, the fortress had already been two days in\r\nthe power of the English. This, to the French, was another unaccountable\r\nbusiness; they, even yet, had not learned fully to appreciate the\r\nsovereign virtues of British bayonets. \"I think the capture of Badajoz a\r\nvery extraordinary event,\" Lery, Soult's chief engineer, wrote to\r\nGeneral Kellerman, \"and I am much at a loss to account for it in a clear\r\nand distinct manner.\" This comes at the end of a mysterious sort of\r\nepistle, in which the engineer general talks of fatality, and seems to\r\nthink that the British had no right to take Badajoz, defended as it was.\r\nBut Wellington and his army were great despisers of that sort of\r\n_right_, and, in spite of the really glorious defence, in spite of the\r\nstrategy of the governor and the valour of the garrison, of _chevaux de\r\nfrise_ of sword-blades, and of the deadly accuracy of the French\r\nartillery and musketeers, Badajoz was taken. The triumph was fearfully\r\ncostly. Nearly four thousand five hundred men fell on the side of the\r\nbesiegers;--Picton's division was reduced to a skeleton, and the\r\nConnaught Rangers lost more than half their numbers.\r\n\r\nShot through the body at Badajoz, Mr Grattan was left there when his\r\ndivision marched away. He gives a terrible account of the sacking of the\r\ntown; but on such details, even had they not been many times\r\nrecapitulated, it is not pleasant to dwell. The frightful crimes\r\nperpetrated during those two days of unbridled excess and violence, rest\r\nat the door of the man whose boundless ambition occasioned that most\r\ndesolating war. From an ignorant and sensual soldiery, excited to\r\nmadness by a prolonged resistance, and by one of the most sanguinary\r\nconflicts recorded in the history of sieges, forbearance could hardly be\r\nexpected. The horrible saturnalia, in which murder and rape, pillage and\r\nintoxication, are pushed to their utmost limits, are the necessary\r\ncondition of a successful assault on a desperately defended fortress;\r\nand supposing them prohibited, and that such prohibition could be\r\nenforced, we agree with Mr Grattan in believing that many a town that\r\nhas been victoriously carried, might have been found impregnable. But\r\none must ever deplore the disgraceful scenes enacted in the streets and\r\nhouses of Badajoz, Ciudad Rodrigo, and St Sebastian. Unsurpassed in\r\natrocity, they remain everlasting blots upon the bright laurels gathered\r\nby the British in the Peninsula. And it is small palliation, that under\r\nsimilar circumstances, the armies of all nations have acted in like\r\nmanner. Here the sufferers were not enemies. To the garrison, when their\r\nresistance ceased, quarter was given; they were marched away scatheless,\r\nand treated with that humanity which England, notwithstanding the lying\r\nassertions of foreign historians, has ever used towards her prisoners.\r\nNo, the victims were friends and allies. The very nation in whose behalf\r\nour soldiers had fought, saw their houses ransacked, their property\r\nwasted, their wives and daughters brutally outraged, by those whose\r\nmission was to protect and defend. Let us hope they have forgotten, or\r\nat least forgiven, such gloomy episodes in the struggle for their\r\nliberation.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of universal peace might adduce many potent and practical\r\narguments in favour of their doctrine from the pages of Mr Grattan's\r\nbook. He is unsparing in his details of the inevitable horrors of war;\r\nand some of his descriptions, persons of tender hearts and sensitive\r\nnerves will do well to pass over. They may be read with profit by those\r\nwho, accustomed to behold but the sunny side of military life, think too\r\nlightly of the miseries war entails. Let such accompany Mr Grattan\r\nthough the streets of Badajoz, on the morning of the 7th April, 1812,\r\nand into the temporary hospital of Villa Formosa, after the fierce\r\nconflict of Fuentes d'Onore, where two hundred soldiers still awaited,\r\ntwenty-four hours after the action, the surgeons' leisure, for the\r\namputation of their limbs. Let them view with him the piles of\r\nunsuccoured wounded on the breach of Badajoz, and hear the shrieks and\r\ngroans of men dying in helpless agony, without a friendly hand to prop\r\ntheir head, or a drop of water to cool their fevered lips. From such\r\nharrowing scenes it is pleasant to turn to the more humane and redeeming\r\nfeatures of civilised warfare, and to note the courteous and amicable\r\nrelations that existed between the contending armies when, as sometimes\r\nhappened, they lay near together without coming to blows. This occurred\r\npreviously to the battle of Salamanca. From the 3d to the 12th of July,\r\nthe French and British were in presence of each other, encamped on\r\neither side the Douro, at that season little more than a rivulet. Of\r\ncourse all were on the alert; there was no laxity or negligence that\r\ncould tempt to surprise; but neither was there any useless skirmishing\r\nor picket firing; every thing was conducted in the most gentlemanly and\r\ncorrect manner. The soldiers bathed together and exchanged their\r\nrations, and the officers were on equally good terms. \"The part of the\r\nriver of which I speak was occupied, on our side, by the Third division;\r\non the French side by the Seventh division. The French officers said to\r\nus at parting, 'We have met, and have been for some time friends. We are\r\nabout to separate, and may meet as enemies. As friends we received each\r\nother warmly; as enemies we shall do the same.' Ten days afterwards the\r\nBritish Third and the French Seventh division were opposed to each other\r\nat Salamanca, and the Seventh French was destroyed by the British\r\nThird.\" Mr Grattan's wound was healed in ample time for him to assist at\r\nthe battle of Salamanca; a glorious victory, which would have been even\r\nmore complete had the British been properly seconded by their Portuguese\r\nallies. The behaviour of these was any thing but creditable to their\r\nnation. One detachment of cacadores actually threw themselves on their\r\nfaces to avoid the enemy's fire, and not all the blows showered on them\r\nby their commander, Major Haddock, could induce them to exchange their\r\nrecumbent attitude for one more dignified. Notwithstanding this, and the\r\nmore fatal feebleness of Pack's brigade, the French were totally beaten,\r\nand their loss was nearly four times that of the British. Lord\r\nWellington's opinion of the battle--a particularly honourable one to our\r\ntroops, inasmuch as they not only _fought_ better, but (which was not\r\nalways the case) moved and manoeuvred better, than the picked veterans\r\nof the French army--is sufficiently shown by the fact that \"he selected\r\nit in preference to all his other victories, as the most fitting to be\r\nfought over in sham-fight on the plains of St Denis, in the presence of\r\nthe three crowned heads who occupied Paris after the second abdication\r\nof the Emperor Napoleon, in 1815.\"\r\n\r\nAt Salamanca, the right brigade of the Third division, including the\r\nConnaught Rangers, charged the entire division of the French General\r\nThomiere. So awful was the volley that welcomed them, that more than\r\nhalf the officers, and nearly the whole front rank, were swept away.\r\nDoubtless the French thought this would prove a sickener, for great was\r\ntheir consternation when, before the smoke had well cleared away, they\r\nsaw the shattered but dauntless brigade advancing fiercely and steadily\r\nupon them. Panic-stricken, they wavered; \"the three regiments ran\r\nonward, and the mighty phalanx, which a moment before was so formidable,\r\nloosened and fell in pieces before fifteen hundred invincible British\r\nsoldiers fighting in a line of only two deep.\" In this memorable charge,\r\nthe standard-pole of the Eighty-eighth was struck by a bullet, the same\r\nthat killed Major Murphy, who commanded the battalion. New colours have\r\nsince been presented to the regiment, but the wounded pole is still\r\npreserved, and on it is engraved, on a plate of silver, the day and the\r\nmanner of its mutilation.\r\n\r\nAn advance on Madrid was consequent on the triumph at Salamanca, and on\r\nthe 12th of August, Wellington and his army reached the Spanish capital.\r\nTheir entrance has often been described, but in default of novelty, Mr\r\nGrattan's account of it possesses spirit and interest. It was one of\r\nthose scenes that repay soldiers for months of fatigue and danger. The\r\ntroops were almost carried into the city in the arms of the delighted\r\npopulace. The steady, soldier-like bearing of the men, the appearance of\r\nthe officers, nearly all mounted, inspired respect and increased the\r\ngeneral enthusiasm. For miles from Madrid, the road was thronged; when\r\nthe army got into the streets, it was no longer possible to preserve the\r\norder of march. The ranks were broken by the pressure of the crowd, and\r\nthe officers (lucky dogs!) were half-smothered in the embraces of the\r\ncharming Madrilenas. Young and old, ugly and handsome, all came in for\r\ntheir share of hugs and kisses. Still, although patriotism impelled the\r\nSpanish fair to look with favour upon the scarlet-coated Britons, the\r\npainful confession must be made that as individuals they gave the\r\npreference to the lively, light-hearted Frenchmen. Napoleon was the\r\nfiend himself, incarnate in the form of an under-sized Corsican, and the\r\n_gavachos_ were his imps, whom it was praise-worthy to shoot at from\r\nbehind every hedge, and to poniard whenever the opportunity offered.\r\nSuch was the creed inculcated by the priests, and devoutly entertained\r\nby their petticoated penitents--that is to say, by every Christian woman\r\nin the Peninsula. But somehow or other, when French regiments were\r\nquartered in Spanish towns, the female part of the population forgot the\r\nanathemas of their spiritual consolers, and looked complacently upon\r\nthose they were enjoined to abhor. It was a case of \"_nos amis les\r\nennemis_,\" and the French, beaten every where in the field, obtained\r\nfacile and frequent triumphs in the boudoir. \"It is a singular fact, and\r\nI look upon it as a degrading one,\" says Mr Grattan with diverting\r\nseriousness, \"that the French officers, whilst at Madrid, made in the\r\nratio of five to one more conquests than we did.\" The dignity of the\r\nadmission might be questioned; the degree of degradation is matter of\r\nopinion; the singularity is explained away by Mr Grattan himself. He\r\nblames his comrades for their stiff, unbending manners, and for their\r\nnon-conformance to the customs of the country. They were nearly three\r\nmonths at Madrid, and yet he declares that, at the end of that time,\r\nthey knew little more of the inhabitants than of the citizens of Pekin.\r\nAnd he opines that the impression left in Spain by the Peninsular army\r\nwas rather one of respect for their courage, than of admiration of their\r\nsocial graces and general affability. If Mr Grattan, whilst reposing at\r\nease upon his well-earned bays, would devise and promulgate an antidote\r\nto the mixture of shyness, reserve, and hauteur, which renders\r\nEnglishmen, wherever they travel, the least popular of the European\r\nfamily, he would have a claim on his country's gratitude stronger even\r\nthan the one he established whilst defending her with his sword in the\r\nwell-contested fields of the Peninsula. Notwithstanding, however, the\r\nunamiability with which he reproaches his companions in arms, there was\r\nmuch fun and feasting, and sauntering in the Prado, and bull-fighting\r\nand theatre-going, whilst the British were at Madrid. But it was too\r\npleasant to last long. The best a soldier can expect in war-time, is an\r\nalternation of good quarters and severe hardship. The \"_quart-d'heure de\r\nRabelais_\" was at hand, when all the dancing, drinking, masking, and\r\nother pleasant things should be paid for, and the brief enjoyment\r\nforgotten, amidst the sufferings of the most painful retreat--excepting,\r\nof course, that of Corunna--effected by a British army during the whole\r\nwar. We refer to the retrograde movement that followed the unsuccessful\r\nsiege of Burgos.\r\n\r\nThe high reputation of the British soldier rests far more upon his arms\r\nthan upon his legs; in other words, he is a fighting rather than a\r\nmarching man. Slowness of movement, in the field as on the route, is the\r\nfault that has most frequently been imputed to him. One thing is pretty\r\ngenerally admitted; that, to work well, he must be well fed. And even\r\nthen he will hardly get over the ground as rapidly, or endure fatigue as\r\nlong, as the lean lathy Frenchman, who has never known the liberal\r\nrations and fat diet the other is accustomed to. When a certain period\r\nof active service and long marches has given the English soldier his\r\ncampaigning legs, he must still have his regular grog, or he soon flags,\r\nif he does not grumble and become insubordinate. Rations were bad, and\r\nhard to be got, on the retreat from Burgos. Then, Mr Grattan tells us,\r\nthe superior marching qualities of the Irish were manifest. There had\r\nbeen very little beef-steak and bacon expended in _their_ bringing up;\r\nscanty fare was nothing new to them, and by no means affected their\r\ngaiety and good-humour. And when shoes were scarce, what cared they? The\r\nstones in Connaught are not a bit softer than those in Spain; and\r\nnine-tenths of the boys had trotted about, from infancy upwards, with\r\n\"divel a brogue, save the one on their tongues.\" Some of the English\r\nregiments--the Forty-fifth for instance, chiefly composed of Nottingham\r\nweavers--would, under ordinary circumstances, march as well as any\r\nIrishman of them all: \"But if it came to a hard tug, and that we had\r\nneither rations nor shoes, then, indeed, the Connaught Rangers would be\r\nin their element, and out-march almost any battalion in the service.\" On\r\nthe retreat from Burgos to Portugal, they gave proof of their toughness\r\nand endurance; for whilst other regiments were decimated by fatigue and\r\nsickness, the Eighty-eighth scarcely lost a man, except by the enemy's\r\nfire. It was a time when the good qualities of all were severely tested.\r\nThe movement began in a most unfavourable season. The roads were nearly\r\nimpassable from heavy rains, and for days together there was not a dry\r\njacket in the army. At night they lay in the open country, often in a\r\nswamp, without a tent to shelter them; the baggage was detached, and\r\nthey never saw it till they reached Ciudad Rodrigo. It was share and\r\nshare alike amongst men and officers, and many of the latter were mere\r\nstriplings, who had but lately left the comforts of their English homes.\r\nWhen they halted from their weary day's march, the ill-conditioned\r\nbeasts collected for rations had to be slaughtered; sometimes they came\r\ntoo late to be of any use, or the camp-kettles did not arrive in time to\r\ncook them; and the famished soldiers had to set out again, with a few\r\npieces of dry biscuit rattling in their neglected stomachs, and driven\r\nto satisfy the cravings of hunger with the acorns that strewed the\r\nforests. There was little money afloat, for pay was four months in\r\narrear, but millions would have been useless where there was nothing to\r\nbuy. The country was deserted; every where the inhabitants fled on the\r\napproach of the two armies. Disease was the natural consequence of so\r\nmany privations; ague and dysentery undermined the men's strength, and\r\nmany poor fellows, unable to proceed, were left upon the road. Horses\r\ndied by hundreds, and those which held out were for the most part\r\nsore-backed, one of the greatest calamities that can happen to cavalry\r\nand artillery on the march. Fortunately Soult, who, with ninety thousand\r\nmen, followed the harassed army, had some experience of British troops.\r\nAnd what he had seen of them, especially at Albuera and on the Corunna\r\nretreat, had inspired him with a salutary respect for their prowess.\r\nThey might retreat, but he knew what they could and would do when driven\r\nto stand at bay. And therefore, although Wellington was by no means\r\naverse to fight, and actually offered his antagonist battle on the very\r\nground where, four months previously, that of Salamanca had occurred,\r\nthe wary Duke of Dalmatia declined the contest. He played a safe game:\r\nwithout risking a defeat by a general action, or attempting to drive the\r\nBritish before him with the bayonet, he hovered about their rear,\r\ndisquieted them by a flank movement of part of his force, and had the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that their loss by the casualties and fatigues\r\nof the march and inclemency of the weather, was as great as it would\r\nprobably have been had he engaged them. For, besides those who perished\r\non the road, when the army got into winter quarters, a vast number of\r\nmen and officers went into hospital, and months elapsed before the\r\ntroops were fully reorganised and fit for the field. At a day's march\r\nfrom Ciudad Rodrigo, Wellington's rear-guard had a smart skirmish, and\r\nthen Soult desisted from his pursuit, and the Anglo-Portuguese were\r\nallowed to proceed without further molestation. Although disastrous, and\r\nin some respects ill managed, the retreat was in no way disgraceful. The\r\nFrench, very superior in numbers, had, whenever they pressed forward,\r\nbeen bravely met, and invariably repulsed.\r\n\r\nWith this retreat, Mr Grattan's Peninsular campaigns closed. He returned\r\nto Ireland, and in the summer of 1814, embarked for Canada. He rather\r\nrefers to, than records the service he saw there; taking occasion,\r\nhowever, for a strong censure on Sir George Prevost, who, after forcing\r\nour ill-appointed fleet on Lake Champlain into action, refused to allow\r\nBrisbane and his brigade of \"Peninsulars\" to take the fort of\r\nPlatsburgh, an enterprise easy of achievement, and which would have\r\nplaced the captured ships, and the victorious but disabled American\r\nflotilla, at the mercy of the British. But we have not space to follow\r\nthe Ranger across the Atlantic, nor is it essential so to do; for,\r\nalthough he gives some amusing sketches of Canada and the Canadians, the\r\nearlier portion of his book is by far the most interesting, and\r\ncertainly the most carefully written. We could almost quarrel with him\r\nfor defacing his second volume with perpetual and not very successful\r\nattempts at wit. We have rarely met with more outrageous specimens of\r\npunning run mad, than are to be found in its pages. Barring that fault,\r\nwe have nothing but what is favourable to say of the book. Its tone is\r\nmanly, and soldier-like, and it is creditable both to the writer and to\r\nthe service, by which, during the last thirty years, our stores of\r\nmilitary and historical literature have been so largely and agreeably\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] _Adventures of the Connaught Rangers, from 1808 to 1814._ By W.\r\nGRATTAN, Esq. London. 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD SIDMOUTH'S LIFE AND TIME.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo read a memoir of the late Lord Sidmouth, is like taking a walk\r\nthrough Westminster Abbey. All the literature, is inscriptions; all the\r\nfigures are monumental; and all the names are those of men whose\r\ncharacters and distinctions have been echoing in our ears since we had\r\nthe power to understand national renown. The period between 1798, when\r\nthe subject of this memoir made his first step in parliamentary life as\r\nSpeaker, and 1815, when the close of the war so triumphantly finished\r\nthe long struggle between liberty and jacobinism, was beyond all\r\ncomparison the most memorable portion of British history.\r\n\r\nIn this estimate, we fully acknowledge the imperishable fame of\r\nMarlborough in the field, and the high ability of Bolingbroke in the\r\nsenate. The gallantry of Wolfe still throws its lustre over the\r\nconcluding years of the second George; and the brilliant declamation of\r\nChatham will exact the tribute due to daring thought, and classic\r\nlanguage, so long as oratory is honoured among men. But the age which\r\nfollowed was an age of realities, stern, stirring, and fearful. There\r\nwas scarcely a trial of national fortitude, or national Vigour, through\r\nwhich the sinews of England were not then forced to give proof of their\r\nhighest power of endurance. All was a struggle of the elements; in which\r\nevery shroud and tackle of the royal ship of England was strained; and\r\nthe tempest lasted through nearly a quarter of a century. England, the\r\ndefender of all, was the sufferer for all. Every principle of her\r\nfinancial prosperity, every material of her military prowess, every\r\nbranch of her constitutional system, every capacity of her political\r\nexistence, her Church, her State, and her Legislature, were successively\r\ncompelled into the most perilous yet most powerful display; and the\r\nclose of the most furious hostility which Europe had ever seen, only\r\nexhibited in a loftier point of view the victorious strength which\r\nprinciple confers upon a people.\r\n\r\nCompared with this tremendous scene, the political conflicts of the\r\npreceding age were a battle on the stage, compared with the terrors of\r\nthe field. The spectators came to enjoy a Spectacle, and sit tranquilly\r\nadmiring the brilliancy of the caparisons and the dexterity of the\r\ncharge; but perfectly convinced that all would end without harm to the\r\nchampions, and that the fall of the curtain would extinguish the war.\r\nBut, in the trials of the later time, there were moments when we seemed\r\nto be throwing our last stake; when the trumpets of Europe, leagued\r\nagainst us, seemed to be less challenging us to the field, than\r\npreceding us to the tomb; and when the last hope of the wise and good\r\nmight be, to give the last manifestation of a life of patriotic virtue.\r\n\r\nIn language like this, we are not abasing the national courage. We are\r\npaying the fullest homage to the substantial claims of the English\r\nheart. It is only by the severest national struggles that the\r\nsuperiority of national powers can be developed; and without doubting\r\nthe qualities of the Marlboroughs and Chathams--or even without\r\ndoubting, that if thrown into the battle of the last fifty years, they\r\nwould have exhibited the same intellectual stature and powerful\r\nadroitness which distinguished their actual displays--yet they wanted\r\nthe strong necessities of a time like ours, to place them on a similar\r\nheight of renown. Still their time continues in admirable study. But it\r\nis like the story of the Volscian and Samnite combats, read in the day\r\nwhen the consul, flying through the streets of Rome, brought the news of\r\nCannae.\r\n\r\nThe wars and politics of the eighteenth century were the manoeuvres of\r\na _garde du corps_, and the intrigues of a boudoir. Our fathers saw no\r\nnation of thirty millions rushing to the field; frantic with the\r\npassion for overthrow, no Napoleon thundering at the head of vassal\r\nEurope against England; no conspiracy of peoples against thrones; no\r\ntrain of crouching sovereignties, half in terror and half in servility,\r\nready to do the wildest will of the wildest despot of the world; no army\r\nof five hundred thousand men ready to spring upon our shores, and\r\nturning off only to the overthrow of empires. All was on a smaller\r\nscale; the passions feebler, the means narrower, the objects more\r\ntrivial, the triumphs more temporary, the catastrophe more powerless,\r\nand the glory more vanishing.\r\n\r\nAll has since subsided; and the mind of man is turned to efforts in\r\ndirections totally new. All now is the rigid struggle with the physical\r\ndifficulties of society. The grand problems are, how to level the\r\nmountain, and to drain the sea: or, if we must leave the Alps to be\r\nstill the throne of the thunder, and suffer even the Zuyder-zee to roll\r\nits sullen waves over its incorrigible shallows; yet to tunnel the\r\nmountain and pass the sea with a rapidity, which makes us regardless of\r\nthe interposition of obstacles that once stopped the march of armies,\r\nand made the impregnable fortresses of kingdoms. But the still severer\r\ntrials of human intelligence are, how to clothe, feed, educate, and\r\ndiscipline the millions which every passing year pours into the world.\r\nThe mind may well be bewildered with a prospect so vast, so vivid, and\r\nyet so perplexing. Every man sees that old things are done away, that\r\nphysical force is resuming its primitive power over the world, and that\r\nwe are approaching a time when Mechanism will have the control of\r\nnature, and Multitude the command of society.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are many families in England which, without any change of\r\ncircumstances, without any increase of fortune, or any discoverable\r\nvicissitudes, have existed for centuries, in possession of the same\r\nproperty, generally a small one, and handed down from father to son as\r\nif by a law of nature. The family of Lord Sidmouth is found to have held\r\nthe proprietorship of the small estate of Fringford, in Oxfordshire,\r\nfrom the year 1600, and to have had a residence in Bannebury about a\r\ncentury and a half before;--the first descendant of this quiet race who\r\nbecame known beyond the churchyard where \"his village fathers sleep,\"\r\nbeing Dr Addington, who died in 1799. Genealogies like those give a\r\nstriking view of the general security of landed possession, which the\r\nhabits of national integrity, and the influence of law, must alone have\r\neffected, during the turbulent times which so often changed the\r\nsuccession to the throne of England.\r\n\r\nDr Addington, who had been educated at Winchester school, and Trinity\r\nCollege, Oxford, having adopted medicine as his profession, commenced\r\nhis practice at Reading, where he married the daughter of the Rev. Dr\r\nNiley, head-master of the grammar-school. The well-known trial of the\r\nwretched parricide, Miss Blandy, for poisoning, in which he was a\r\nprincipal witness, brought him into considerable notice; and probably on\r\nthe strength of this notice, he removed to London, and took a house in\r\nBedford Row, where the late Lord Sidmouth, his fourth child, but eldest\r\nson, was born. He next removed to Clifford Street, a more fashionable\r\nquarter, which brought him into intercourse with many persons of\r\ndistinction. Among these were Louth, Bishop of London, the Duke of\r\nMontagu, Earl Rivers, and, first of the first, the great Earl of\r\nChatham. With this distinguished man, Dr Addington seems to have been on\r\nterms of familiar friendship, as the following extracts show:--Chatham\r\nwrites from Burton Pynsent, in 1771.\r\n\r\n\"All your friends here, the flock of your care, are truly sensible of\r\nthe kind attentions of the good shepherd. My last fit of the gout left\r\nme as it had visited me, very kindly. I am many hours every day in the\r\nfield, and, as I live like a farmer abroad, I return home and eat like\r\none. * *\r\n\r\n\"Ale goes on admirably, and agrees perfectly. My reverence for it, too,\r\nis increased, having just read in the manners of our remotest Celtic\r\nancestors much of its antiquity and invigorating qualities. The boys all\r\nlong for ale, seeing papa drink it, but we do not try such an\r\nexperiment. Such is the force of example, that I find I must watch\r\nmyself in all I do, for fear of misleading. If your friend William saw\r\nme smoke, he would certainly call for a pipe.\"\r\n\r\nLord Chatham died May 11th, 1788, which event was thus notified by Dr\r\nAddington to his son Henry.\r\n\r\n\"You will be grieved to hear that Lord Chatham is no more. It pleased\r\nProvidence to take him away this morning, as if it were in mercy that he\r\nmight not be a spectator of the total ruin of a country which he was not\r\npermitted to save.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor was a croaker, as was the fashion of the time, with all who\r\npretended to peculiar political sagacity. Of course the family physician\r\nof the ex-minister was in duty bound to echo the ex-minister's\r\ndiscontent. It is clear that, whatever professional gifts the doctor\r\ninherited from Apollo, he did not share the gift of prophecy. The\r\ndoctor, after realising enough by his profession to purchase an estate\r\nin Devonshire, retired to Reading, where, in 1790, he died, having had,\r\nin the year before, the enviable gratification of seeing his son elected\r\nto the Speakership of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nHenry Viscount Sidmouth was born in 1757, on the 30th of May. At the age\r\nof five years, he was placed under the care of the Rev. William Gilpin,\r\nauthor of the Essays on the Picturesque, who for many years kept a\r\nschool at Cheam, in Surrey.\r\n\r\nLord Sidmouth had but one brother, Hiley, who subsequently figured so\r\noften in the caustic rhymes of Canning, and who, under his brother's\r\nauspices, was successively secretary of the treasury, paymaster of the\r\nforces, and under-secretary of state. In his twelfth year, Henry,\r\nfollowed by Hiley, was sent to Winchester, then under the government of\r\nthe well-known Dr Joseph Wharton, with George Isaac Huntingford as one\r\nof the assistants.\r\n\r\nThe author of the biography gives Huntingford credit for the singular\r\ndegree of attachment exhibited in his occasional letters to his pupil.\r\nIt certainly seems singular; when we know the slenderness, if not\r\nsternness of the connexion generally subsisting between the teachers at\r\na great English seminary, and the pupils. In one of those epistles\r\nHuntingford says to this boy of fifteen.\r\n\r\n\"For my own part, to you I lay open _my whole heart without reserve_. I\r\ndivest myself of the little superiority which age may have given me.\r\nWith you I can enter into conversation with all the familiarity of an\r\nintimate companion. The few hours of intercourse which we thus enjoy\r\nwith each other give more relief to my wearied body and mind than _any\r\nother amusement on earth_. What I am to do when you leave school, _a\r\nmelancholy thought, I cannot foresee_. May the _evil hour be postponed_\r\nas late as possible. Yet let me add, whenever it shall be most for your\r\nadvantage to leave me, I will not doubt to sacrifice _my own peace_ and\r\ncomfort for your interest. _I love myself, but you better_.\"\r\n\r\nWe hope that this style is not much in fashion in our public schools.\r\nDean Pellew tells us that numerous letters of this kind were written by\r\nthis tutor to his pupil in after life, and adds with a ludicrous\r\nsolemnity, \"It will readily be imagined how _efficacious_ they must have\r\nproved, in forming the character of the future statesman, and erecting\r\nSpartan and Roman virtues on the noble foundation of Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nFor our part, we know not what to make of such communications: they seem\r\nto us intolerably silly, and we think ought _not_ to have been\r\npublished. In later life, their writer was made Bishop of Hereford and\r\nWarden of Winchester. He seems to have been a fellow of foresight!\r\n\r\nIn 1773, Henry and Hiley were both removed from Winchester, and put\r\nunder the tuition of Dr Goodenough, who took private pupils at Ealing,\r\nand who was afterwards Bishop of Carlisle. In the next year, Henry\r\nentered as commoner in Brazen-Nose College under the tuition of\r\nRadcliffe, then a tutor of some celebrity. In this college he became\r\nacquainted with Abbot, afterwards Lord Colchester, and William Scott,\r\nafterwards Lord Stowell. He took his degree in 1778, and in this year\r\nhad the misfortune to lose his mother, who seems to have been an amiable\r\nand sensible person. In the next year, he obtained the Chancellor's\r\nprize for an English essay on \"the affinity between painting and writing\r\nin point of composition;\" and at the recital of this essay in the\r\ntheatre he first became acquainted with Lord Mornington, afterwards\r\nMarquis Wellesley, an intimacy which lasted for sixty-two years. He now\r\nadopted law as his profession, took chambers in Paper Buildings, and\r\nkept his terms regularly at Lincoln's Inn. In 1781, he married Ursula\r\nMary, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Leonard Hammond, Esq. of Cheam,\r\nin Surrey, and took a house in Southampton Street, Bloomsbury, where he\r\ndetermined to follow the profession of the law. But this determination\r\nwas speedily over-ruled by the success of the celebrated son of Chatham.\r\nOn the 26th of February, 1781, William Pitt, then only in his\r\ntwenty-second year, made his first speech in the House of Commons, in\r\nsupport of Burke's bill for the regulation of the civil list. This epoch\r\nin parliamentary annals is noticed in a brief letter from Dr Goodenough\r\nto Pitt's early tutor, Wilson, who sent it to Mr Addington, among whose\r\npapers it was found:--\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir,--I cannot resist the natural impulse of giving pleasure, by\r\ntelling you that the famous William Pitt, who made so capital a figure\r\nin the last reign, is happily restored to his country. He made his first\r\npublic re-appearance in the senate last night. All the old members\r\nrecognised him instantly, and most of the young ones said he appeared\r\nthe very man they had so often heard described: the language, the\r\nmanner, the gesture, the action were the same; and there wanted only a\r\nfew wrinkles in the face, and some marks of age, to identify the\r\nabsolute person of the late Earl of Chatham.\"\r\n\r\nAddington, at this period, had a good deal of intercourse with Pitt, who\r\nbecame Chancellor of the Exchequer at the age of twenty-three, and whose\r\nbrilliant success in parliament evidently stimulated his friend to\r\npolitical pursuits. But the infamous coalition broke in, and Pitt was\r\ndismissed from the ministry. Its existence, however, was brief: it not\r\nmerely fell, but was crushed amidst a universal uproar of national\r\nscorn; and Pitt, not yet twenty-five, was appointed prime minister. In\r\nthe course of the month, an interview took place between Pitt and\r\nAddington, which gave his friends strong hopes of seeing him in\r\nimmediate office. His friend Bragge thus writes to him:\r\n\r\n\"I give you joy of the effects of the interview of last Sunday, of which\r\nI am impatient to hear the particulars. Secretary, either official or\r\nconfidential, I should wish you, and indeed all the boards are already\r\nfilled.\"\r\n\r\nStill, he remained unappointed, though his intimacy with the minister\r\ngrew more confidential from day to day. Pitt was at this time engaged in\r\na desperate struggle with the Opposition, who, ruined as they were in\r\ncharacter, yet retained an overwhelming majority in parliament. On this\r\noccasion, the young statesman gave perhaps the most triumphant evidence\r\nof his remarkable sagacity. Every one was astonished, that he had not at\r\nonce dissolved a parliament which it seemed impossible for him either to\r\nconvince or conquer. But, with the House of Lords strongly disposed\r\ntowards him, and the King for his firm friend, Pitt fought the House\r\nnight after night, until he found the national feeling wholly on his\r\nside. Then, on the 25th of March, 1784, he dissolved the parliament, and\r\nby that act extinguished the whole power of Whiggism for twenty years.\r\nThere never was a defeat more ruinous; more than a hundred and sixty\r\nmembers, who had generally been of the Foxite party, were driven\r\nignominiously from their seats, and the party was thenceforth condemned\r\nto linger in an opposition equally bitter, fruitless, and unpopular. In\r\nthe new parliament, Addington was returned for the borough of Devizes in\r\nplace of Sutton, his brother-in-law, who, being advanced in life, made\r\nover his interest to his young relative. On this occasion, he received a\r\nletter from his old master, Joseph Wharton:--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot possibly forbear expressing to you the sincere pleasure I\r\nfeel, in giving you joy of being elected into a parliament that I hope\r\nand trust will save this country from destruction, by crushing the most\r\nshameful and the most pernicious coalition that I think ever disgraced\r\nthe annals of any kingdom, ancient or modern. I am, dear sir, with true\r\nregard, yours, &c.--JOSEPH WHARTON.\"\r\n\r\nThere are few more remarkable instances of contrasted character and\r\ncircumstance than Addington's ultimate rise to power. The anecdote is\r\nmentioned, that on one occasion, when they were riding together to Holl\r\nWood, then Mr Pitt's seat near Bromley in Kent, that on Pitt's urging\r\nhim to follow up politics with vigour, and the latter alleging in excuse\r\nthe distaste and disqualification for public life created by early\r\nhabits and natural disposition, Pitt burst forth in the following\r\nquotation from Waller:--\r\n\r\n    \"The lark that shuns on lofty boughs to build\r\n    Her humble nest, lies silent in the field:\r\n    But should the promise of a brighter day,\r\n    Aurora smiling, bid her rise and play;\r\n    Quickly she'll show 'twas not for want of voice,\r\n    Or power to climb, she made so low a choice:\r\n    Singing she mounts, her airy notes are stretch'd\r\n    Towards heav'n, as if from heav'n alone her notes she fetch'd.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, he set spurs to his horse, and left his companion to\r\nponder on the moral of the poetry.\r\n\r\nBut neither poetry nor prose could inspire Addington's mind with the\r\nardour of his glowing friend. Parliament was indeed open to him, but the\r\ntrue gate to parliamentary distinction would never have been opened by\r\nhis own hand. There are two kinds of speaking, and but two, which ever\r\nmake distinguished way in the House. The first is, that superior order\r\nwhich alone deserves the name of eloquence, and which must carry\r\ndistinction with it wherever men are gathered together. The next is,\r\nthat adroit and practical style of speaking by which the details of\r\npublic business are carried forward; a style which requires briskness of\r\ncapacity, united to extent of information, and in which the briskness\r\nmust not be suffered to become flippant, and the detail to become dull.\r\nWe are perfectly confident, that, beyond those two classes, no speaker\r\ncan ever expect to retain the ear of the House. Our theory, however, is\r\nnot the favourite one with that crowd, whose diatribes nightly fill the\r\ncolumns of the newspapers; where bitterness is perpetually mistaken for\r\npungency, and petulance for power, dryness for business and commonplace\r\nfor conviction. But failure is the inevitable consequence; the archer\r\nshowers his shafts in vain; they are pointed with lead, and they always\r\nfall blunt on the ground. Some of the noisiest haranguers of our time\r\nutterly \"waste their sweetness on the desert air,\" their hearers drop\r\naway with fatal rapidity, and the orator is reminded of his triumph only\r\nby the general flight of his auditory. Then comes some favourite of the\r\nHouse: the coffee-room is thinned in its turn; the benches are crowded\r\nonce more; and some statesmanlike display consoles the House for its\r\nlost time. Addington's habits were those of a student, and he brought\r\nthem with him into parliament. In the House of Commons, there are nearly\r\nas many classes of character, as there are in life outside the walls.\r\nThere are the men made for the operations of public life, bold, active,\r\nand with an original sense of superiority. Another class is made for\r\nunder-secretaries and subordinates, sharp, and ingenious men, the real\r\nbusiness-men of the House. Another class, perfectly distinct, is that of\r\nthe matter-of-fact men, largely recruited from among opulent merchants,\r\nbankers sent from country constituencies, and others of that calibre,\r\nwho are formidable on every question of figures, are terrible on\r\ntariffs, and evidently think, that there is no book of wisdom on earth\r\nbut a ledger. Then come the country gentlemen, generally an excellent\r\nand honest race, but to whom a life in London, in the majority of\r\ninstances, has a strong resemblance to a life in the Millbank\r\nPenitentiary; driven into parliament, by what is called a \"sense of\r\ntheir position in the country,\" which generally means the commands of\r\ntheir wives, &c., &c., their sojourn within the circuit of the\r\nmetropolis is a purgatory. They sicken of the life of lounging through\r\nLondon, where they are nothing, and long to get back to the country\r\nwhere they are \"magistrates;\" generally too old to dance, the\r\nfashionable season has no charms for them: even the clubs seem to them\r\na sort of condemned cell, where the crowd, guilty of unpardonable\r\nidleness, cluster together with no earthly resource but gazing into the\r\nstreet, or poring over a newspaper. If this service is severe enough to\r\nshake their philosophy during the sleety showers of February, and the\r\nwithering blasts of March; the first break of sunshine, and the first\r\nstreak of blue sky, makes their impatience amount to agony. The rest of\r\nthe season only renders their suffering more inveterate; until at last\r\nthe discharge of cannon from the Park, and the sound of trumpets at the\r\ndoors of the House of Lords, a gracious speech from the throne, and a\r\nstill more gracious smile from the sitter on it, let them loose from\r\ntheir task, and they are free, facetious, and foxhunters once more.\r\nThere are still half-a-dozen other classes, \"fine by degrees, and\r\nbeautifully less,\" which may be left to the imagination of the reader,\r\nand the experience of the well-bred world.\r\n\r\nAddington soon made himself useful on committees. The strong necessities\r\nof the case, much more than the Reform Bill, have remarkably shortened\r\nthe longevity of election committees. The committee, in general, was\r\nfortunate, which could accomplish its business within three months. Some\r\ntook twice the number, some even crossed over from session to session.\r\nThe first committee on which Addington was engaged had this unfortunate\r\nduration, and he was re-appointed to it in the second session of the\r\nparliament of 1785.\r\n\r\nAt this period, whether from a sense of disappointment, or from the\r\nsilent dulness of this drudgery, his health appears to have been in a\r\nfeeble state. In a letter to his father, he apologises for listlessness\r\nand stupidity by illness, and says, \"that he does not come up to the\r\ndefinition of man as a risible animal.\" Yet the man who could live to\r\neighty-seven, and retain his health in a retirement of nearly a quarter\r\nof a century, could not complain of his constitution.\r\n\r\nIn 1786 Pitt availed himself of the opening of the session to induce his\r\nfriend to break ground. He proposed that he should second the address;\r\nand almost condescended to coax him into further exertion of his\r\nabilities.--\"I will not disguise,\" says his letter, \"that, in asking\r\nthis favour of you, (the speech,) I look beyond the immediate object of\r\nthe first day's debate; from a persuasion that whatever induces you to\r\ntake a part in public, will equally contribute to your personal credit,\r\nand that of the system to which I have the pleasure of thinking you are\r\nso warmly attached. Believe me to be, with great truth and regard, my\r\ndear sir, faithfully and sincerely yours,--W. PITT.\" Addington complied\r\nwith a part of the proposal, seconded the Address, and was considered to\r\nhave performed his task with effect. But the effort went no farther. His\r\nability lay in another direction; and though a clear, well-informed, and\r\ninfluential debater in his more public days, and when the urgency of\r\noffice compelled the exertion, he left for four years the honours of\r\ndebate to the multitude of his competitors.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the memoir, there is a letter of Addington's, speaking\r\nof Sheridan's famous speech on the Begum question. Addington voted in\r\nthe majority against Hastings; but, though he does not exactly say that\r\nSheridan's famous speech was the cause of his vote, he yet joins in the\r\ngeneral acclamation.\r\n\r\nIt has been the habit of late critics to decry the merits of this famous\r\noration, and even to charge it with being frivolous, outrageous, and\r\nbombastic, an immense accumulation of calumny and clap-trap, which the\r\ncraft of Sheridan would not submit to the public ordeal, and which he\r\nhas therefore left to its chance of a fantastic and visionary fame. But\r\nthis we find it impossible to believe. That in a speech of five hours\r\nand a half, there may have been--nay, there must have been, passages of\r\nextravagance, and even errors of taste, is perfectly probable; but they\r\nmust have been overcome by countless passages of lustre and beauty,--by\r\npowerful conceptions and brilliant examples of language; at once\r\nresistless and refined,--by living descriptions, and thoughts of daring\r\nand dazzling energy, sufficient to have made it one of the most\r\nmemorable triumphs of senatorial eloquence in the world. How, on any\r\nother supposition, is it possible to account for the effects which we\r\nknow it to have produced?\r\n\r\nAddington's letter, alluding to this subject, says \"The papers will\r\nconvey but a faint idea of a speech, which I heard Fox declare to be the\r\nmost wonderful effort of the human mind that perhaps had ever been made.\r\nMr Pitt, and indeed the whole House, spoke of it in terms of admiration\r\nand astonishment, scarcely inferior to those of Mr Fox.\"\r\n\r\nThe papers, indeed, convey a worse than inadequate idea of this\r\nwonderful oration, for they give merely a few fragments, in which they\r\nhave contrived either to select their examples with the most curious\r\ninfelicity, or to blunder them into bombast. But nothing can be more\r\nchildish than to suppose, that Pitt would have given his praise to\r\ntawdry metaphor, that Burke would have done honour to feeble truisms,\r\nthat Fox should have been unable to distinguish between logic and\r\nlooseness of reasoning, or that the whole assembly, who had been in the\r\nhabit of hearing those pre-eminent orators, should have been tricked by\r\ntheatric dexterity or charlatan rhetoric into homage. The oration must\r\nhave been a most magnificent performance, and we have only to deplore\r\nthe loss of a great work of genius.\r\n\r\nAnother young phenomenon shot across the parliamentary horizon within\r\nthe same month. It was the late Earl Grey. A letter of Addington to his\r\nfather thus describes the debut of this young Liberal.\r\n\r\n\"Feb. 22, 1787.--We had a glorious debate last night, upon the motion\r\nfor an address of thanks to the King, for having negotiated the\r\ncommercial treaty. A new speaker presented himself to the House, and\r\nwent through his first performance with an eclat that has not been\r\nequalled within my recollection. His name is Grey; he is not more than\r\ntwenty-two years of age, and he took his seat, which is for\r\nNorthumberland, only in the present session. I do not go too far in\r\ndeclaring, that in the advantages of figure, elocution, voice, and\r\nmanner, he is not surpassed by any one member of the House; and I grieve\r\nto say, that he was last night in the ranks of Opposition, from which\r\nthere is no prospect of his being detached.\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious to see, how easily the exigencies of party mould men, and\r\nhow readily under that pressure they unsay their maxims, and retract\r\ntheir principles. The object of the commercial treaty was, to put our\r\ncommerce in some degree on a fair footing with that of France. The\r\nobject of Mr Grey's rhetoric was, to show that the commercial treaty was\r\naltogether a blunder, which, as being a Tory and ministerial\r\nperformance, it must be in the eyes of a Whig and an oppositionist. But\r\nthe maxim on which he chiefly relied, was the wisdom of that established\r\nsystem of our policy, in which France had always been regarded with the\r\nmost suspicious jealousy at least--if not as our natural foe. Of course\r\nthis Whig maxim lasted just so long as the Whigs were out of office, and\r\ncould use it as a weapon against the Minister. But, from the moment when\r\nFrance became actually dangerous, when her councils became demoniac, and\r\nher factions frenzied, Whiggism, despairing of turning out the Minister\r\nby argument, resolved to make the attempt by menace. Hopeless in the\r\nHouse, it appealed to the rabble, and France was extolled to the skies.\r\nWe then heard nothing of the \"natural enmity,\" but a vast deal of the\r\ninstinctive friendship. England and France were no longer to be two\r\nhostile powers sitting on their respective shores, with flashing eyes\r\nand levelled spears, but like a pair of citizen's wives loaded with\r\npresents and provisions for each other, and performing their awkward\r\ncourtesies across the Channel.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged, however, that the Whig maxim, though a\r\nwatchword of faction, was no blunder of fact. A commercial treaty with\r\nthe French in that day, or in any other day before or since, was a\r\ndream. To bring the Frenchman to any rational agreement on the subject\r\nof trade, or to keep him steady to any agreement whatever, has been a\r\nproblem, which no British statesman has been able to solve. No\r\ncommercial treaty, even with all the genius of Pitt, has ever produced\r\nto England the value of the paper on which it is written. Whether, if\r\nthey were two Englands in the world, they might not establish commercial\r\ntreaties with each other, may be a question. But we regard it as an\r\nabsolute waste of time, to think of trading on fair terms with any of\r\nthe slippery tariffs of foreign countries. In fact, this is now so\r\nperfectly understood, that England has nearly given up the notion of\r\ncommercial treaties. She trades now, where the necessities of the\r\nforeigner demand her trade. The foreigner hates John Bull, Just as the\r\nAthenian peasant hated Aristides, and for the same reason. He hates him\r\nfor being honest, manly, and sincere; he hates him for the integrity of\r\nhis principles, for the purity of his faith, and for the _reality_ of\r\nhis freedom; he hates him for his prosperity, for his progress, and for\r\nhis power. And while the Frenchman capers in his fetters, and takes his\r\npromenade under the shadow of the fortifications of Paris; while the\r\nGerman talks of constitutions in the moon; and while the Holy Alliance\r\namuses itself with remodelling kingdoms, John Bull may be well content\r\nto remain as he is, and leave them to such enjoyment as they can find in\r\nsulkiness and sneering.\r\n\r\nGrey's brilliant debut appears not to have been sustained: he spoke\r\nlittle during the session, but talked much--a fatal distinction to a\r\nparliamentary aspirant. Ambitious of figuring, he attempted to figure on\r\nall occasions; and, once or twice, unluckily daring the great champion\r\nof the treasury bench to the field, he was driven from it with wounds\r\nwhich, if they did not teach him a sense of his weakness, at least\r\ntaught him a sense of his danger. Mr Grey's credit, says Addington in a\r\nletter, \"as a man of discretion and temper, remains to be established.\r\nHis reputation for abilities has not increased within the last two\r\nmonths, while he has in all respects enhanced that of the person (Pitt)\r\nto whom he ventured to oppose himself.\"\r\n\r\nIn alluding to the intercourse of Addington with Wilberforce, the\r\nbiographer, we think very justly, complains of the sillinesses which\r\nhave transpired in the latter's diary. Addington took higher views on\r\necclesiastical subjects; and was less _rapid_ in his movements for the\r\nabolition of the slave-trade; being of opinion that precipitate measures\r\nwould only increase the traffic to an enormous extent, deprive England\r\nof all power of restraining the frightful atrocities of the middle\r\npassage; and, by throwing the whole trade into the hands of foreigners,\r\nleave it open to all the reckless abominations of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe result was, unfortunately, all that rational men anticipated. The\r\ntrade carried on by the foreigner has been tripled, or even quadrupled;\r\nthe horrors of the middle passage are without restraint; and the\r\nsufferings of the victims, on their march to the coast, by fatigue, want\r\nof food, and the cruelty of their treatment, are estimated to destroy\r\nnearly twice the number of those who ever cross the Atlantic. The very\r\npowers with whom we have already made treaties for the purpose of\r\nextinguishing this infernal traffic, are deepest in its commerce; and\r\nits extinction now seems hopeless, except through some of those\r\ntremendous visitations, by which Providence scourges crimes which have\r\ngrown too large for the jurisdiction of man.\r\n\r\nLord Sidmouth, then far advanced in life, when he saw those remarks in\r\nthe diary, naturally felt offended, but he bore the offence with\r\ndignity, merely saying, as he closed the volume, \"Well, Wilberforce does\r\nnot speak of me as he spoke to me, I am sorry to say.\" Of Wilberforce,\r\nno one can desire to doubt the general honesty; but that he was\r\nsingularly trifling and inconstant, was evidently the opinion of his\r\ncontemporaries in the House. The following anecdote is given from the\r\nauthor's notes on this point. \"Lord Sidmouth told us, that one morning,\r\nat a cabinet meeting, after an important debate in the House of Commons,\r\nsome one said, 'I wonder how Wilberforce voted last night:' on which\r\nLord Liverpool observed, 'I do not know how he voted, but of this I am\r\npretty sure, that in whatever way he voted, he repents of his vote this\r\nmorning.' Lord Sidmouth added, 'It was odd enough, that I had no sooner\r\nreturned to my office, than Wilberforce was announced, who said,--Lord\r\nSidmouth, you will be surprised at the vote I gave last night, and,\r\nindeed, I am not myself altogether satisfied with it;'--to which I\r\nreplied, My dear Wilberforce, I shall never be _surprised_ at any vote\r\nyou give.'\"\r\n\r\nDuring this session the abolition of Negro slavery first seriously\r\nattracted the notice of parliament. The conduct of it, in the House of\r\nCommons, was intrusted to Wilberforce; but, in his absence, in\r\nconsequence of indisposition, Pitt, on the 9th of May 1798, moved the\r\nresolution, \"that the House would, early in the next session, proceed to\r\ntake into consideration the circumstances of the slave trade.\" In a\r\ncause like this, the humane and magnanimous mind of Burke naturally\r\nenlisted at once. But he was by no means of that school of humanity\r\nwhich gains the race, only by riding over every thing in its way.\r\nRed-hot humanity had no charms for the great philosopher; and,\r\nphilanthropist as he was, he could discover no wisdom in measures which\r\nchanged only one violence for another, pauperised the whites without\r\nliberating the blacks; and, while it cost twenty millions sterling to\r\nrepair about third of the injury, left the unhappy African at the mercy\r\nof avarice round the circumference of the globe.\r\n\r\nA letter from Huntingford says:--\"Dr Lawrence, our Winchester\r\nacquaintance, called on me lately. He talked much on Mr Burke's ideas\r\nrespecting the slave-trade. I found by him that Mr Burke foresaw the\r\ntotal ruin of the West-India colonies, if the trade were _at once_\r\nprohibited. He is for a better regulation of the ships which carry on\r\nthat infamous commerce: he would lay the captains under restrictions,\r\nand punish them with rigour for wanton severity or brutal inhumanity to\r\nthe slaves; and, when the poor creatures are purchased at the West-India\r\nislands, he would have them instructed in religion; and be permitted to\r\npurchase their own freedom, when by industry they should acquire a\r\nsufficient sum for that purpose. For their religious instruction he\r\nwould erect more churches; and, to enable them in time to accumulate the\r\nprice of their ransom, he would enact that the property of a slave\r\nshould be as sacred as that of a freeman.\" Burke went further than\r\nopinions, for he embodied his sentiments in a paper entitled, \"Sketch of\r\na Negro Code,\" all outline of a bill in parliament, which is to be found\r\nin the collection of his works.\r\n\r\nIn August of this year, Addington mentioned that Lord Grenville passed a\r\nmonth with him at Lyme, and that one day visiting Lord Rolle, a party\r\nwere speculating on the probable successor to the Speaker\r\n(Cornwall)--Grenville and Addington giving it as their opinion, that\r\nneither of them had any chance. He adds, \"within twelve months, we were\r\nboth Speakers ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nAn important and melancholy event, however, threw the cabinet and the\r\ncountry alike into confusion. Early in November, it was ascertained that\r\nthe King was taken dangerously ill. Three successive notes from\r\nGrenville represented the illness as most alarming, and giving room for\r\napprehening of incurable disorder. As Dr Addington was known to have\r\npaid particular attention to cases of insanity, Pitt proposed his being\r\nsummoned to visit the royal patient. In consequence, he visited his\r\nMajesty for several days, and on examination with the other physicians\r\nbefore the Privy Council, expressed a strong expectation of the royal\r\nrecovery, founded on the circumstance that this illness had not, for its\r\nforerunner, any of the symptoms which usually precede a serious attack\r\nof this nature. The debates on the Regency Bill now brought out all the\r\nvigour of the House. The Whigs thundered at the gate of the cabinet; but\r\nthere was a strong hand within, and it was still kept shut. The Prince\r\nof Wales, then under all the captivations of Whig balls and banquets,\r\nand worshiping at the feet of Fox, was no sooner to be master of the\r\nstate by an unlimited Regency Bill, than Fox was to be master of every\r\nthing. Pitt still fought the battle with all the cool determination of\r\none determined never to capitulate. Fox became in succession fierce,\r\nfactious, and half frantic; still his great adversary stood on the\r\nvantage ground of law, and was imperturbable. But the contest now began\r\nto spread beyond the walls of parliament. The spirit of the nation,\r\nalways siding with the brave defence, daily felt an increasing interest\r\nin the gallantry with which Pitt almost alone fought the ablest\r\nOpposition that had ever been ranged within the walls of Westminster,\r\nand inflamed by the sight of power almost within their grasp.\r\n\r\nBut the announcement of a sudden change in his Majesty's indisposition\r\nabated the contest at once. From the 8th to the 20th of February, the\r\nprogress to health was palpable. On the 19th, the discussions on the\r\nRegency Bill were suspended in the House of Lords; and on the 6th of\r\nMarch, the Speaker and several members of the administration were\r\nadmitted to present their congratulations to the King, at Kew, on his\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nWe cannot resist the temptation of exhibiting Lord Sidmouth in the\r\nunsuspected character of a poet. As several millions of verses were\r\npoured out as the offerings of the Muse on the joyful occasion, as\r\nParnassus was rifled by the Universities, and as every village school in\r\nthe kingdom hung a pen-and-ink garland on the altar of AEsculapius or\r\nHygeia; it was felt to be the bounden duty of every candidate for\r\ncabinet honours, to put his desk \"in order,\" and rhyme, to the best of\r\nhis power. Addington, in consequence, produced the following--\r\n\r\n    ON THE KINGS RECOVERY.\r\n\r\n    \"When sinks the orb of day, a borrow'd light\r\n    The moon displays, pale _Regent_ of the night.\r\n    Vain are her beams to bid the golden grain\r\n    Spread plenty's blessings o'er the smiling plain;\r\n    No power has she, except from shore to shore\r\n    To bid the ocean's troubled billows roar.\r\n    With hungry cries the wolf her coming greets;\r\n    Then Rapine stalks triumphant through the streets;\r\n    Avarice and Fraud in secret ambush lurk,\r\n    And Treason's sons their desperate purpose work.\r\n    But, lo! the Sun with orient splendour shines,\"----\r\n    &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nWe cannot indulge ourselves with any more of this loyal lucubration--we\r\nthink that the slur at the _Regency_ was not quite fair; we were by no\r\nmeans aware that the moon was so mischievous; and, as our general\r\nconclusion, we must admit that, if his lordship did not gain the\r\nLaureateship, he amply deserved it. However, better times were at hand.\r\nPitt, like all other eminent men, had a keen insight into character, and\r\nhe had long known the especial qualities of Addington. This solves the\r\ndifficulty of accounting at once for his continued personal intercourse,\r\nand yet his apparent official neglect. He knew him to be well-informed,\r\nintelligent, and honest; although his retiring habits had already given\r\nfull evidence of his indisposition to face the storms of party.\r\n\r\nOn Mr Grenville's promotion to the Home department, in 1789, Addington\r\nwas proposed for the Speaker's chair, and was elected by two hundred and\r\nfifteen to one hundred and forty-two, who voted for the Opposition\r\ncandidate, Sir Gilbert Elliot. In the private correspondence which was\r\nso frequent between him and the minister, various suggestions had been\r\nthrown out by Pitt of the Irish secretaryship, a seat at the treasury,\r\n&c. But the man and the place were now found together, incomparably\r\nadapted to each other. The place implies an honourable neutrality, and\r\nAddington was true to the trust. It requires the favourable opinion of\r\nthe House to the man as well as the officer; and Sheridan's first\r\naddress to him, as the spokesman of the Opposition, was, \"we were all\r\nvery sorry to have voted against you.\" It required considerable\r\nknowledge of general and parliamentary law, and the new Speaker had\r\ndevoted years to their acquisition. Even the minor merits of a grave and\r\ncommanding presence were there; for Addington, in his early years, was\r\nof as striking a countenance and figure as in old age he was gentle and\r\namiable.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic anecdotes are scattered through the volumes: these we\r\nthink their most attractive portion; and of such Addington's memory was\r\nfull in his later years. One night, on his crying out, in the usual\r\nform, to hush some chattering in the House, \"Order, order, or I shall\r\nname names!\" Charles Fox, then standing beside the chair, told him that\r\nWilkes once asked the Speaker, Onslow, what would be the consequence of\r\nhis naming names? \"Heaven above only knows,\" was the solemn reply.\r\n\r\nOne night Fox himself put the same question to Sir Fletcher Norton (the\r\nSpeaker,) who nonchalantly answered, \"Happen! hang me, if I know or\r\ncare!\"\r\n\r\nA substantial proof of the general approval was given to the new\r\nofficial, in the addition of L1000 a-year to his salary; thus giving him\r\nL6000 a-year--which, besides a house, with some other emoluments on\r\npublic and private bills, and the sale of certain clerkships connected\r\nwith the business of the Commons, is generally calculated as equivalent\r\nto about L10,000 yearly. For this, however, the Speaker is expected to\r\nkeep up considerable state, to give occasional banquets during the\r\nsession to successive parties of the members; to have evening receptions\r\nand levees; and, in general, to lead a rather laborious life; the least\r\npart of whose labour is in the Speaker's chair. He has also the\r\nappointment of a chaplain to the House, which is equivalent to the\r\ndisposal of valuable church patronage, the chaplain being always\r\nprovided for, after a few years' attendance, by a request of the House\r\nto the crown. To complete this accumulation of good things, the Speaker\r\nwho exhibits intelligence, is frequently promoted to the higher offices\r\nof the cabinet, and generally receives a peerage.\r\n\r\nBut those were the \"piping times of peace;\" times of trouble and terror\r\nwere at hand. The French democracy had already burst on Europe; and\r\nevery throne was heaving on the surge which it had raised. Pitt alone,\r\nof all the great ministers of Europe, seemed to disregard its hazards.\r\nCustomary as it is for the pamphleteers of later times to assail his\r\nmemory, as the promoter of hostilities, the chief outcry against Pitt in\r\nthe year 1790, was his tardiness in thinking that those hostilities\r\ncould ever force England to take a share in the struggles of the\r\nContinent. The whole aristocracy, the whole property, the whole\r\nmercantile interest, and even the whole moral feeling of the empire, had\r\nbecome from hour to hour more convinced that a war was inevitable. Even\r\nthe Opposition, whose office it was to screen the atrocities of every\r\nnational enemy, and who, for a time, had looked to Jacobinism as an\r\nauxiliary in the march to power, had at last shrunk from this horrible\r\nalliance--had felt the natural disgust of Englishmen for an association\r\nwith the undisguised vice and vileness of the Republic, and had at last\r\nsunk into silence, if not into shame. Burke had published his immortal\r\n\"Reflections,\" and their sound had gone forth like the tolling of a vast\r\nfuneral bell for the obsequies of European monarchy. Still, nothing\r\ncould move Pitt. By nature, a financier, and by genius the most\r\nmagnificent of all financiers, he calculated the force of nations by the\r\ndepths of their treasuries; and seeing France bankrupt, conceived that\r\nshe was on the verge of conviction, and waited only to see her sending\r\nher humbled Assembly to beg for a general loan, and for a general peace\r\nat the same moment.\r\n\r\nBut those were days made to show the shortsightedness of human sagacity.\r\nThe lesson was rapidly given; it was proved in European havoc, that\r\nutter powerlessness for good was not merely compatible with tremendous\r\npower for evil, but was actually the means of accumulating that power;\r\nthat the more wretched, famishing, and haggard a nation might become at\r\nhome, the more irresistible it might prove abroad: that, like the\r\nmadman, it might be fevered and tortured by mental disease, into\r\npreternatural strength of frame, and might spring out of the bed where\r\nit had lain down to die, with a force which drove before it all the\r\nordinary resistance of man. Pitt had still to learn, that this was a\r\nwar of Opinion; and had to learn also, that Opinion was a new material\r\nof explosion, against whose agency all former calculation was wholly\r\nunprovided, and whose force was made to fling all the old buttresses and\r\nbattlements of European institutions like dust and embers into the air.\r\n\r\nIt is not worth the trouble now to inquire, whether Pitt's sagacity\r\nequally failed him in estimating the probable effect of the French\r\nRevolution on England. His expression at a dinner party, where\r\nAddington, Grenville, and Burke formed the guests, \"Never mind, Mr\r\nBurke, we shall go on as we are until the day of judgment;\" shows his\r\nfeeling of the stability of the constitution. As we have no love for\r\ndiscovering the\r\n\r\n     \"Fears of the brave, and follies of the wise,\"\r\n\r\nwe are gratified by thinking that both were partly in the right: Burke,\r\nin regarding the Revolution as destined to sweep the Continent with long\r\nand tremendous violence, and Pitt as believing it likely to make but\r\nlittle _permanent_ impression on the habits, the power, or the heart of\r\nEngland. Burke argued from the weakness of the Continental governments;\r\nPitt from the strength of the British constitution: the former having no\r\nconnexion with the national interests, the latter being formed from\r\nthose interests, for those interests, and being as much supported by\r\nthem as a tree by its roots. There was not a portion of that stately\r\ntree, from its solid trunk to the highest ornament of its foliage, which\r\nwas not fed from the ground. The truth was, that the Jacobinisim of\r\nEngland was confined to adventurers, and never obtained any hold on the\r\ngreat body of the proprietors and the people. Its spirit evaporated in\r\ntavern harangues, to which the multitude went to listen, as to the\r\nchattering and grimaces of a mountebank.\r\n\r\nNo man of distinction, no man of birth, and no man of property was ever\r\nengaged in those coffee-house conspiracies; their Jaffiers and Pierres\r\nwere cobblers and tinkers, with a sprinkling of petty pamphleteers, and\r\nruined declaimers. When Hardy and Horne Took, were the priests, what\r\nmust be the worshippers at the Jacobin shrine? But in France, the temple\r\nof that idol of confusion was crowded with the chiefs of the Noblesse,\r\nthe Church, the Law; headed by the Prince of the blood next to the\r\nthrone; all stimulated by a ferocity of folly unexampled in the history\r\nof infatuation, and all unconsciously urged to their ruin by a race of\r\nbeings inferior in rank, and almost objects of their scorn, yet, rather\r\nembodied malignities, and essential mischiefs, than men. France in that\r\nfearful time reminded the spectator of Michael Angelo's great picture of\r\nthe \"Last Judgment\"--general convulsion above, universal torment below;\r\nthe mighty of the earth falling, kings, nobles, hierarchs, warriors,\r\nplunging down, and met by fiends, at once their tempters, their\r\ntaunters, and their torturers; a scene of desolation and destiny.\r\n\r\nPitt's sentiment on the safety of England from revolutionary movements\r\nwas so decided, that if France had not invaded Holland, and thus\r\nactually compelled a war, we should probably have had none at this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nA distinction between the state of France and England not less\r\nmemorable, if not still more effective, than in property, was religion.\r\nIn France infidelity was not merely frequent, but was the _fashion_. No\r\nman of any literary name condescended even to the pretence of religion;\r\nbut in England, infidelity was a stigma; when it began to take a public\r\nform, it was only in the vilest quarter; and when it assailed religion,\r\nit was instantly put down at once by the pen, by the law, and by the\r\nmore decisive tribunal of national opinion. Paine, the chief writer of\r\nthe Satanic faction, was a bankrupt staymaker, and a notorious\r\nprofligate: his pamphlet had only the effect of making the public\r\nprotest against its abominations; he was prosecuted, was forced to leave\r\nthe country, and finally died in beggary in America.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable to find so cautious a man as Addington at this period\r\nspeaking of the Church as \"an honest _drone_, who, if she did not stir\r\nherself very soon, would be stung by the wasps of the conventicle.\" The\r\nmetaphor is not good for much, for the drone can sting too, and does\r\nnothing but sting. But what is it that, at any time, makes the church\r\nineffective? The abuse of the ministerial patronage. The clergy\r\naltogether depend on the guidance, the character, and the activity of\r\ntheir bishops. If ministers regard the mitre as merely a sort of\r\ndonative for their own private tutors, or the chaplains of their noble\r\nfriends, or as provision for a relative, dependent, or the brother of a\r\nTreasury clerk, they not merely degrade the office, but they paralyse\r\nthe church. Of the living prelacy we do not speak: but it is impossible\r\nto look upon the list of archbishops and bishops (a few excepted) during\r\nthe last century, without surprise that the inferior clergy have done so\r\nmuch, rather than that they have done so little. Where there was no\r\nencouragement for literary exertion, ability naturally relaxed its\r\nefforts; where preferment was lavished on heads \"that could not teach,\r\nand would not learn,\" disgust extinguished diligence; and where\r\ncharacter for intelligence, practical capacity, and public effect, were\r\nevidently overlooked in the calculation of professional claims, it is\r\nonly in the natural course of things that their exercise should be\r\nabandoned, in fastidiousness or in contempt, in disgust or in despair.\r\nThe church was never in a more ineffective condition than at the close\r\nof the last century; and if the sin was to be laid at the right\r\nthreshold, it must have been laid at the door of Whitehall.\r\n\r\nAddington certainly deserves the credit of having formed a just estimate\r\nof the French Revolution from the beginning. In a letter to his brother\r\nhe inserts this stanza,--\r\n\r\n    \"France shall perish, write that word\r\n    In the blood that she has spilt;\r\n    Perish hopeless and abhorr'd,\r\n    Deep in ruin as in guilt.\"\r\n\r\nHe, however, fell into the common error of the time, and looked upon her\r\noverthrow as certain in the first campaign.\r\n\r\nIt was on the second reading of the Alien Bill that the dagger scene, of\r\nwhich so much was said at the time, occurred in the House of\r\nCommons--thus described by the Speaker: \"Burke, after a few preliminary\r\nremarks, the house being totally unprepared, fumbled in his bosom, and\r\nsuddenly drew out the dagger, and threw it on the floor. His extravagant\r\ngesture excited a general disposition to smile, by which most men would\r\nhave been disconcerted; but he suddenly collected himself, and by a few\r\nbrilliant sentences recalled the seriousness of the house. 'Let us,'\r\nsaid he, 'keep French principles from our heads and French daggers from\r\nour hearts; let us preserve all our blandishments in life, and all our\r\nconsolations in death; all the blessings of time, and all the hopes of\r\neternity.'\"\r\n\r\nAs all partisanship hated Burke, who had trampled it in the mire, this\r\ndagger scene was sneered at as a stage trick; but Burke was above all\r\npantomime. The dagger was one which had been sent from France to a\r\nBirmingham manufacturer, with an order for a large number of the same\r\npattern: and Burke had received it only on that day--and received it\r\nfrom Sir James Bland Burgess only on his way down to the house--so that\r\nthere could have been no preparation for public exhibition. It was a\r\nnatural impulse of the moment, in a time when all was emotion.\r\n\r\nThe murder of the unfortunate King of France, on the 21st of January\r\n1793, perhaps the most wanton murder in all royal history, instantly\r\nbrought out a full display of the _real_ feelings of England. The\r\nuniversal sentiment was horror, mingled with indignation; and when the\r\nroyal message came down to the house on the 28th, stating that, in\r\nconsequence of the regicide, the king had ordered M. Chauvelin, minister\r\nfrom the late king, to leave the country, as being no longer accredited\r\nby the sovereign, the message seemed rather the echo of the national\r\nvoice than the dictate of the government.\r\n\r\nFrom this period the Whig party diminished day by day. They were chiefly\r\nthe great landholders of the kingdom, and they saw in this atrocious act\r\na declaration against all property; but they had also the higher motive\r\nof its being a declaration against all government. The chief persons of\r\nthe Opposition at once crossed the house; but as Horne Tooke, in his apt\r\nand short style, described the party on his trial, \"We all,\" said he,\r\n\"entered the revolutionary coach at Reading; but one got out at\r\nMaidenhead, another at Slough, a third at Hounslow, and a fourth at\r\nBrentford. It was _my_ misfortune, my lord, as it was also Mr Fox's, to\r\ngo on to London.\"\r\n\r\nThe French now threw off all political form, and all diplomatic decorum,\r\nand exhibited the whole savagism of republicanism. On the motion of a\r\nruffian of the name of Garnier, the Convention publicly resolved that\r\n\"Pitt was an enemy to the human race.\" The same ruffian then proceeded\r\nto move, \"that every body had a right to assassinate him.\" This,\r\nhowever, was _not_ carried; but an order was sent, on the proposal of\r\nRobespierre, to the armies, that \"no quarter should be given to the\r\nEnglish troops;\" an order which was not repealed until his death by the\r\nguillotine.\r\n\r\nThose were stirring times, and in every instance of success in the\r\ncampaign, Pitt sent an immediate courier to Addington when out of town,\r\nof which the Speaker gave the signal to the surrounding country by\r\nlighting up his house. On one occasion of this kind, a friend of his,\r\ntravelling on the coach from Bath, heard the coachman say, \"I'm sure\r\nthere's good news come, for there's the Speaker's house all in a blaze.\"\r\n\r\nIn this year Addington was offered the high promotion of Secretary of\r\nState, in the room of Dundas. He consulted Huntingford, who strongly\r\nadvised him against giving up his pleasant, safe, and lucrative office,\r\nfor the toilsome, hazardous, and unpopular office of the secretary. A\r\nletter from the Solicitor-general Mitford, (afterwards Lord Redesdale,)\r\nconfirmed the opinion. It is justly observed by the biographer, that\r\nMitford, who could be so wise for his friend, was not equally so for\r\nhimself; for, after having obtained the speakership in his own person,\r\nhe gave it up to assume the office of Irish Chancellor, a situation of\r\ngreat responsibility, and great labour, in which he was assailed on all\r\nsides, and from which, on the first change of the cabinet, he was\r\ninsultingly recalled.\r\n\r\nThe war had now become almost wholly naval, and it was a war of\r\nsuccessive triumphs. The dominion of Europe seemed about to be divided\r\nbetween England and France: England mistress of the sea--France sweeping\r\nevery thing before her on the land. The famous battle of the 1st of June\r\nextinguished the first revolutionary fleet, seven sail of the line being\r\ncaptured, and the remainder of the fleet escaping with difficulty into\r\nthe French ports.\r\n\r\nThe minister was also triumphant at home, and the chief persons of the\r\nWhig party were gazetted as taking office under his administration. Earl\r\nFitzwilliam as President of the Council, the Duke of Portland as\r\nSecretary of State, Earl Spencer, Privy Seal, the Duke of Gordon, Privy\r\nSeal of Scotland, and Windham, Secretary at War.\r\n\r\nIt had been frequently remarked, that Pitt never sought for coadjutors\r\nof any remarkable ability, from confidence in his own extraordinary\r\nattainments. As Fox candidly and bitterly concluded one of his speeches\r\nin Parliament, saying, \"There is one point, and only one on which I\r\nentirely agree with the right honourable gentleman, and that is, in the\r\nhigh opinion he entertains of his own talents.\"\r\n\r\nIt is certain that those accessions to his cabinet were not likely to\r\nexcite any jealousy on his part, yet there was one whose absence from\r\nthe cabinet may have been justly regretted as detracting at once from\r\nthe strength of the administration, and the glory of the minister. The\r\nname of Burke was _not_ found there, though no man had operated so\r\npowerfully in producing the change; no man had so amply deserved the\r\ndistinction; and no man would have thrown so permanent a lustre round\r\nthe councils in which he shared. There can be no doubt that Burke felt\r\nthis neglect, and that he was justified in feeling himself defrauded of\r\nan honour conferred before his face on men who were not fit to be named\r\nin the same breath.\r\n\r\nBut he has had his noble revenge. Posterity, of all tribunals the most\r\nformidable, yet the most faithful, has done him Justice. While the\r\nfavourites of fortune have passed away into the forgetfulness for which\r\nthey were made, his services assume a higher rank in the records of\r\nnational preservation, and his genius continually fills a prouder place\r\namong the intellectual triumphs of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 Burke closed his parliamentary career, by retiring from the\r\nborough of Malton, for which his son became member. In this year, also,\r\nclosed the memorable trial of Warren Hastings, which had extended over\r\nten sessions of parliament, (from February 1788 to 5th April 1795)--the\r\nactual trial lasting for seven years, two months, and ten days. The\r\nlegal expenses of the defence amounted to seventy-one thousand and\r\neighty pounds, which the proprietors of East India stock, by a majority\r\nof three hundred, on a ballot, paid. What the expenses of the\r\nprosecution were, is not told; probably twice the sum.\r\n\r\nThe whole holds forth an important lesson for the punishment of public\r\ndelinquency. If, instead of the masquerade of an impeachment before the\r\npeers and king, Hastings had been called on to answer before the common\r\nlaw courts, for any one of the hundred acts of personal injury alleged\r\nagainst him, the decision would have been secured as soon as the\r\nwitnesses could have been brought from Calcutta. Of course the world\r\nwould have lost a great deal of parliamentary parade and some capital\r\nspeeches; all the _poetic_ pomp would have been wanting; and the\r\ncourt-dresses would have been left at the tailors. But justice would\r\nhave been done, which no one now believes to have been done.\r\n\r\nThe obvious fact is, that the country had grown tired of a trial which\r\nseemed likely to last for life. After the first sounding of trumpets,\r\nthe flourish excited curiosity no more. The topic had been a toy in the\r\ngreat parliamentary nursery, and the children were grown weary of their\r\ntinselled and painted doll. Even the horrors--and some of the details\r\nhad all the terrible atrocity of barbarism with its passions inflamed by\r\nimpunity--had ceased to startle; the eloquence of the managers had\r\nbecome commonplace by the repetition which had deprived the horrors of\r\ntheir sting. The prosecution was yawned to death.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was not a peer in the seats of Westminster Hall, nor a\r\nmember of the committee, nor a man in the kingdom, except Burke and\r\nPitt, who would not have forgiven Hastings twice the amount of his\r\noffences, to have silenced the subject at once and for ever.\r\n\r\nWith Burke, the impeachment was a vision, half Roman, half Oriental--the\r\naugust severity of a Roman senate, combining with the mysterious\r\nsplendour of the throne of Aurungzebe. He was the Cicero impeaching\r\nVerres in the presence of the eighteenth century, or a high-priest of\r\nsome Indian oracle promulgating the decrees of eternal justice to the\r\neastern world.\r\n\r\nWith Pitt, the whole event was a fortunate diversion of the enemy, a\r\nrelief from the restless assaults of a Whig opposition, a perpetual\r\ndrain on Whig strength, and by a result more effective still, a fruitful\r\nsource of popular ridicule on the lingering impotence of Whig labours.\r\n\r\nOn the acquittal of Hastings, Burke wrote several letters to Addington\r\nas Speaker, which have a tone of the deepest despondency. He writes in\r\nthe impassioned anguish of a man to whom the earth exhibited but one\r\naspect of despair. They were letters such as Priam might have indited on\r\nthe night when his Troy was in a blaze. It was evident that the powerful\r\ngenius of Burke was partially bewildered by the bent of his feelings. He\r\nraised an imaginary sepulchre for England on the spot where he had\r\ncontemplated the erection of a dungeon for Indian crime through all ages\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nThe Indian directors voted Hastings, an annuity of five thousand pounds,\r\nwhich he enjoyed to a very advanced age: yet his acquittal has not\r\nreceived the seal of posterity. A calmer view has regarded him as the\r\ndaring agent of acts fitter for the meridian of Hindoo morality than\r\nEuropean. To serve the struggling interests of the Company seems to\r\nhave been his highest motive, and there can be no doubt that he served\r\nthem with equal sagacity and success. That he was a vigorous\r\nadministrator, an enterprising statesman, and a popular governor, is\r\nbeyond denial; that he was personally unstained by avarice or extortion,\r\nis admitted. But history demands higher proofs of principle; and no\r\ngovernor since his time has ever attempted to imitate his example, or\r\never ventured to excuse his own errors, by alleging the conduct or the\r\nacquittal of Hastings.\r\n\r\nThere are some men, whom no position can render ridiculous, and there\r\nare some quite the reverse: of the latter class was Ferguson of Pitfour.\r\nFerguson's notion of the essential quality of a Lord Advocate was\r\ntallness. \"We Scotch members,\" said he, \"always vote with the Lord\r\nAdvocate, and we therefore require to see him in a division. Now I can\r\nsee Mr Pitt, and I can see Mr Addington, but I cannot see the Lord\r\nAdvocate.\" His lordship evidently not rising to Ferguson's regulation\r\nsize of a statesman.\r\n\r\nOne evening as Ferguson was taking his dinner in the coffee-room, some\r\none ran in, to say, that \"Pitt was on his legs.\" Every one rose to leave\r\nthe room, except Ferguson. \"What!\" said they, \"won't you go to hear Mr\r\nPitt?\" \"No,\" he replied, \"Why should I? do you think Mr Pitt would go to\r\nhear me?\"\r\n\r\nAt a dinner given by Dundas, at Wimbledon, where Addington, Sheridan,\r\nand Erskine were present, the latter was rallied on his not taking so\r\nprominent a part in the debates as his fame required. Sheridan said\r\n(with a roughness unusual with him,) \"I tell you how it happens:\r\nErskine, you are afraid of Pitt, and that's the flabby part of your\r\ncharacter.\"\r\n\r\nThis piece of candour, however, was probably owing to the claret. But\r\nErskine's comparative taciturnity in the House may be accounted for on\r\nmore honourable terms. Erskine was no poltroon: he was the boldest\r\nspeaker at the bar. But the bar was his place, and no man has ever\r\nattained perfection in the two styles of oratory. It is true, that\r\ndistinguished barristers have sometimes been distinguished in the House\r\nof Commons, but they have not been of the race of orators; they have\r\nbeen sharp, shrewd, bitter men, ready on vexatious topics, quick in\r\npeevish speech, and willing to plunge themselves into subjects whose\r\nlabour or license is disdained by higher minds. But Erskine was an\r\n_orator_, vivid, high-toned, and sensitive; shrinking from the\r\ncommon-place subjects which common-place men take up as their natural\r\nportion; rather indolent, as is common with men of genius; and rather\r\ncareless of fame in the senate, from his consciousness of the\r\nunquestioned fame which he had already won at the bar.\r\n\r\nOf Fox some pretty anecdotes are told, substantiating that eminent man's\r\ncharacter for courtesy. One day, as Addington was riding by the grounds\r\nof St Ann's Hill, he was seen over the palings by Fox, who called out to\r\nhim to stop, invited him in, and displayed the beauties of his garden,\r\nto which he had always devoted a great deal of care. As Addington\r\nparticularly admired some weeping ash trees, Fox promised him some\r\ncuttings. Some months elapsed, when one evening, Fox, after going\r\nthrough a stormy meeting, in Palace-yard, went up to the Speaker in the\r\nchair, and said--\"I have not forgotten your cuttings, but have brought\r\nthem up to town with me,\" giving him directions at the same time for\r\ntheir treatment. In a few minutes after, he was warmly engaged in debate\r\nwith Pitt and Burke.\r\n\r\nFox's enjoyment of St Ann's Hill was proverbial. On some one's asking\r\nGeneral Fitzpatrick, in the midst of one of the hottest periods of the\r\ndebates on the French war--Where is Fox? the answer was, \"I daresay he\r\nis at home, sitting on a hay-cock, reading novels, and watching the jays\r\nstealing his cherries.\"\r\n\r\nThe year 1796 was a formidable year for England. Prussia and Spain had\r\ngiven up her alliance. Belgium and Holland had been taken possession of\r\nby the French. Austria was still firm, but her armies were dispirited,\r\nher generals had lost their reputation, her statesmen had been baffled,\r\nher finances were supported only by English loans, and France was\r\nalready by anticipation marking out a campaign under the walls of\r\nVienna. The English Opposition, at once embittered by defeat, and\r\nstimulated by a new hope of storming the cabinet, carried on a perpetual\r\nassault in the shape of motions for peace. The remnants of Jacobinism in\r\nEngland united their strength with the populace once more; and, taking\r\nadvantage of the continental defeats, of the general timidity of our\r\nallies, and of the apparent hopelessness of all success against an enemy\r\nwho grew stronger every day, made desperate efforts to reduce the\r\ngovernment to the humiliation of a forced treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for raising eighteen millions, followed by seven millions\r\nand a half more, increased the public discontent; and, although the\r\nsolid strength of England was still untouched, and the _real_ opinion of\r\nthe country was totally opposed to their rash demands for peace, there\r\ncan be no question, that the louder voice of the multitude seemed to\r\ncarry the day. A bad harvest also had increased the public difficulties;\r\nand, as if every thing was to be unfortunate at this moment, Admiral\r\nChristian's expedition--one of the largest which had ever left an\r\nEnglish port, and which was prepared to sweep the French out of the West\r\nIndies--sailing in December, encountered such a succession of gales in\r\nthe chops of the Channel that a great part of this noble armament was\r\nlost, and the admiral reached the West Indies with the survivors, only\r\nto see them perish by the dreadful maladies of the climate.\r\n\r\nBut, to complete the general disastrous aspect of affairs, a new\r\nphenomenon suddenly blazed over Europe. The year 1796 first saw Napoleon\r\nBuonaparte at the head of an army. Passing the Alps on the 9th of April,\r\nhe fell with such skill and vigour on the Austrian and Italian troops,\r\nthat in his first campaign he destroyed five successive Austrian armies;\r\nbroke up the alliances of that cluster of feeble and contemptible\r\nsovereignties which had so long disgraced Italy in the eyes of Europe;\r\ntrampled on their effeminate and debauched population, with the\r\nsternness of an executioner rather than the force of a conqueror; and\r\nafter sending the plunder of their palaces to Paris, in the spirit and\r\nwith the pomp of the old Roman triumphs, dragged their princes after him\r\nto swell his own triumphal progress through Italy.\r\n\r\nThe war now engrossed every feeling of the nation; and England showed\r\nher national spirit in her gallant defiance of the threat of invasion.\r\nThe whole kingdom was ready to rise in arms on the firing of the first\r\nbeacon;--men of the highest rank headed their tenantry; men even of\r\nthose grave and important avocations and offices, which might seem to\r\nimply a complete exemption from arms, put themselves at the head of\r\ncorps in every part of the empire; and England showed her prime minister\r\nas Colonel Pitt of the Walmer volunteers, and the speaker of her House\r\nof Commons, as Captain Addington of the Woodley cavalry.\r\n\r\nBut a brilliant change was at hand. In September, Addington received the\r\nfollowing note from Pitt, enclosing the bulletin of the battle of the\r\nNile:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have just time to send you the enclosed Bulletin (_vive la\r\n     Marine Anglaise_,) and to tell you, that we mean, (out of\r\n     precaution) the meeting of Parliament for the 6th of November.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, ever yours, W. P.\"\r\n\r\nThe bulletin which gave value to this note, belongs to history, and\r\ngives to history one of the noblest events of our naval annals. It\r\nexhibits a singular contrast to the present rapidity of communication,\r\nthat even the \"rumour\" of Nelson's immortal victory did not reach until\r\nfifty-seven days after the event. The Gazette could not be published\r\nuntil the 2d of October.\r\n\r\nBut the star of Pitt, which had hitherto shone with increasing\r\nbrightness from year to year, and which had passed through all the\r\nclouds of time uneclipsed, was now to wane. The Irish attempt to\r\nestablish a separate Regency, the Irish Rebellion, and the growing\r\ninfluence of the Popish party, combined with Liberalism in the Irish\r\nlegislature, had determined Pitt to unite the parliaments of the two\r\nkingdoms. For this purpose, he made overtures to the Popish party,\r\nwhose influence he most dreaded in the Irish House; and, in a species of\r\n\"understanding\" rather than a distinct compact, he proposed to the\r\nPopish body the measure which has been subsequently called\r\n\"Emancipation,\" with some general intimation of pensioning their\r\npriesthood.\r\n\r\nThe Union was carried; and Lord Castlereagh, who had conducted it in\r\nIreland, was appointed to bring the Popish proposition forward. It had\r\nbeen a subject of deliberation in the cabinet for nearly six months\r\nbefore they mentioned it to the king. His Majesty virtually pronounced\r\nit irreconcilable to his conscience; and, after having received the\r\nopinion of Lord Kenyon, the chief-justice, in complete confirmation of\r\nhis own, he sent for the speaker. Pitt had written, in the meantime, to\r\nthe king, that he must carry the measure or resign. The king then\r\nproposed that Addington should take the conduct of the government. On\r\nhis entreating to decline the proposal, the king said emphatically \"Put\r\nyour hand upon your heart, and ask yourself where I am to turn for\r\nsupport, if _you_ do not stand by me?\" Addington then honourably\r\nattempted once more to induce Pitt to be reconciled to the king's\r\ndesire, who replied, as to Addington's taking the cabinet, \"I see\r\nnothing but _ruin_ if you hesitate.\" A letter from the king to Pitt\r\nstill left an opening for his return, but his answer was still\r\ninflexible; and, on the 5th of January, 1801, the correspondence was\r\nconcluded by the royal announcement that \"a new arrangement would be\r\nmade without delay.\"\r\n\r\nThe determination of George III. was personal and purely conscientious.\r\nAn anecdote is given by General Garth strikingly in accordance with this\r\nopinion. The General, who was one of the royal equerries, was riding out\r\nwith the king one day at this time, when his Majesty said to him, \"I\r\nhave not had any sleep this night, and am very bilious and unwell;\" he\r\nadded, \"that it was in consequence of Mr Pitt's applying to him on the\r\nsubject of Catholic Emancipation.\"\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Kew, he desired Garth to read the Coronation Oath, and\r\nthen followed the exclamation,--\"Where is that power on earth to absolve\r\nme from the due observance of every sentence of that oath, particularly\r\nthe one requiring me to maintain the Protestant religion? Was not my\r\nfamily seated on the throne for that express purpose? And shall I be the\r\nfirst to suffer it to be undermined, perhaps overturned? No. I had\r\nrather beg my bread from door to door throughout Europe, than consent to\r\nany such measure.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the language of an honest man, and it was also the language of\r\na wise one. What has the introduction of Papists into parliament\r\noccasioned to England, but political confusion? What benefit has it\r\nproduced to Ireland? No country in the wildest portion of the earth has\r\nexhibited a more lamentable picture of insubordination, dissension, and\r\npublic misery. The peasantry gradually sinking into the most abject\r\npoverty; the gentry living on loans; the laws set at defiance; the\r\ndemand for rents answered by assassination; a fierce faction existing in\r\nthe bowels of the land, as if for the express purpose of inflaming every\r\npassion of an ignorant people into frenzy, and deepening every\r\nvisitation of nature into national ruin. At this moment, England is\r\npaying for the daily food of two millions of people; employing seven\r\nhundred thousand labourers, simply to keep them alive; and burthening\r\nthe most heavily-taxed industry in the world with millions of pounds\r\nmore, for the sole object of rescuing Ireland from the last extremities\r\nof famine.\r\n\r\nWe take our leave of this most distressing subject, by the obvious\r\nremark, that Pitt and the politicians, in treating popery as a political\r\nobject, have all alike overlooked the true nature of the question.\r\nPopery is a _religion_, and if that religion be _false_, no crime can be\r\ngreater in the sight of Heaven, nor more sure to bring evil on man, than\r\nto give it any assistance in its temptations, progress, or power, by any\r\nmeans whatever. To propagate a false religion is to declare war against\r\nthe Divine will, and in that warfare suffering must follow. But what\r\nProtestant can have a doubt upon the subject? England may regard\r\nherself as signally fortunate, if the just penalty of her weakness is\r\nalready paid.\r\n\r\nMr Addington's Ministry began auspiciously, with the peace of Amiens.\r\nThe world was weary of war. France had just learned the power of the\r\nBritish army, by the capture of her army in Egypt; she was without a\r\nship on the seas; Napoleon was desirous of consolidating his power, and\r\nascending a throne; and thus, all interests coinciding, peace was\r\nproclaimed.\r\n\r\nLord Sidmouth's life from this period was connected with the highest\r\ntransactions of the state, until 1822, when he retired from office,\r\nfollowed by the universal respect of the country, and bearing with him\r\ninto his retirement a conscience as void of offence, as perhaps ever\r\nbelonged to any Minister of England.\r\n\r\nThen followed a period, which might have been regarded as, even here,\r\nthe fitting reward of such a life. Prom 1822 to 1844, he lived in the\r\nenjoyment of health, and that honour, and those troops of friends, which\r\nare the noblest human evidence of a well-spent existence.\r\n\r\nOld age came on him at last, but with singular gentleness. Some of his\r\nmaxims exhibit the mild philosophy of his temperament. \"In youth,\" said\r\nhe, \"the absence of pleasure is pain, in age the absence of pain is\r\npleasure.\" He characteristically observed, \"At my age, it strikes me\r\nvery much, what little proportion there is between man's ambition, and\r\nthe shortness of his life.\" Of the wars during his time he said, \"I used\r\nto think all the sufferings of war lost in its glory; I now consider all\r\nits glory lost in its sufferings.\" In allusion to the desponding tone of\r\nsome public men, he said, \"I have always fought under the standard of\r\nhope, and I never shall desert it.\" At another time, he expressed the\r\ntruth, which only the wise man feels--\"It is a very important part of\r\nwisdom, to know what to overlook.\" He repeated a fine expression of\r\nGeorge III, of which he acknowledged the full value,--\"Give me the man\r\nwho judges _one_ human being with severity, and every other with\r\nindulgence.\"\r\n\r\nHis religious feelings were such as might be expected from his\r\nwell-spent life,--pure, benevolent, and high-toned. Speaking to his\r\nfamily, in his last illness, he said, \"Kind, dutiful, affectionate\r\nchildren, all have been to me; and if I am permitted to attain to that\r\nhappy state to which I aspire, and am permitted to look down, how often\r\nshall I be with you, my children!\"\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of February, 1844, he was seized with an attack of influenza,\r\nwhich on the 10th became hopeless; and on the 15th he calmly died, in\r\nhis 87th year.\r\n\r\nWe have preferred giving an abstract of the leading portions of this\r\nable and amiable man's ministerial career, to following it minutely\r\nthrough his later public years, as the earlier were those which decided\r\nthe character of the whole: and we have also preferred the tracing the\r\ncourse of the individual, to criticisms on the volumes of his\r\nbiographer. But the work deserves much approval, for its general\r\nintelligence, the clearness of its arrangement, and the fulness of its\r\ninformation. It exercises judgment in the spirit of independence, and,\r\nexpressing its opinions without severity, exhibits the grave sagacity of\r\na man of sense, the style of a scholar, and the temper of a divine.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] _The Life and Correspondence of the Right Honourable Henry\r\nAddington, First Viscount Sidmouth._ By the Honourable GEORGE PELLEW,\r\nD.D., Dean of Norwich. 3 vols. J. Murray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THEY MANAGE MATTERS IN THE MODEL REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our last April number--on the appropriate Day of Fools--we laid\r\nbefore our readers a few stray flowers of speech, culled with little\r\nlabour in that rich garden of oratorical delight--the Congress of the\r\nUnited States. Sweets to the sweet!--We confess that we designed that\r\nsalutary exposure less for the benefit of our readers and subscribers in\r\nthe Old World, than of those who are our readers, but not our\r\nsubscribers, in the New. For, in the absence of an international\r\ncopyright law, Maga is extensively pirated in the United States,\r\nextensively read, and we fear very imperfectly digested. This\r\narrangement appears to us to work badly for all the parties concerned.\r\nIt robs the British publisher, and impoverishes the native author. As to\r\nthe American public, if our precepts had exercised any influence upon\r\ntheir practice, they would have learned long ago that ill-gotten goods\r\nnever prosper, and that they who make booty of other men's wits, are not\r\nexcepted from the general condemnation of wrong-doers. Some day,\r\nperhaps, they will consent to profit by what they prig, and thus, like\r\nthe fat knight, turn their diseases to commodity--the national disease\r\nof _appropriation_ to the commodity of self-knowledge and self-rebuke.\r\n\r\nAn American journalist, however, has put the matter in quite a new\r\nlight, so far as we are concerned. Lord Demus, it appears, like other\r\ndespots, is a hard master, and exacts from his most oppressed slaves a\r\ntribute of constant adulation. We, too, are invited to applaud his\r\nfelonious favours, and assured that the honour and glory of being read\r\nby him on his own free and easy terms, is enough for the like of us.\r\n\r\n\"So long,\" says the editor of the _New York Gazette_ and _Times_ \"as our\r\nNational Legislature refuses to give the Republic an International\r\nCopyright Law, so that American periodicals of a higher class may be\r\nsupported among us, the English reviews will do the thinking of our\r\npeople upon a great variety of subjects. They make no money, indeed,\r\ndirectly, by their circulation here; but their conductors cannot but\r\nfeel the importance, and value the influence of having the whole\r\nAmerican literary area to themselves. _Blackwood_, whose circulation on\r\nthis side of the Atlantic is, on account of its cheapness, double\r\nperhaps that which it can claim in the British islands, is more and more\r\nturning its attention to American subjects, which it handles generally\r\nwith its wonted humorous point, and witty spitefulness.\"\r\n\r\nThis is very fine; but we can assure our friendly critic, that we feel\r\nno call whatever to undertake the gratuitous direction of the American\r\nconscience. Our ambition to \"do the thinking\" of our Yankee cousins is\r\nmaterially damped by the unpleasant necessity which it involves, of\r\nbeing \"done\" ourselves. They seem, however, to claim a prescriptive\r\nright to the works of the British press, as well as to the funds of the\r\nBritish public. They read our books, on the same principle as they\r\nborrow our money, and abuse their benefactors into the bargain with more\r\nthan Hibernian asperity. After all, however, we believe that the candour\r\nof Maga has as much to do with their larcenous admiration of her pages,\r\nas the \"cheapness\" to which our New York editor alludes. To use their\r\nown phrase, \"they go in for excitement considerable;\" and, to be told of\r\ntheir faults, is an excitement which they seldom enjoy at the hands of\r\ntheir own authors. Now, we are accustomed to treat our own public as a\r\nrational, but extremely fallible personage, and to think that we best\r\ndeserve his support, by administering to his failings the language of\r\nunpalatable truth. And we greatly mistake the character of Demus, and\r\neven of that conceited monster the American Demus,--\r\n\r\n    [Greek: agroikos orgen, kuamotrox, akracholos upokophos--]\r\n\r\nif this be not the direction in which the interest, as well as the duty,\r\nof the public writer lies. Certain it is, that even in the United States\r\nthose books circulate most freely, which lash most vigorously the vices\r\nof the Republic. Honest Von Raumer's dull encomium fell almost\r\nstill-born from the press, while the far more superficial pages of\r\nDickens and Trollope were eagerly devoured by a people who are daily\r\ngiven to understand, by their own authors, that they are the greatest,\r\nthe wisest, the most virtuous nation under the sun. Let a European\r\nauthor be never so well disposed towards them, his partial applause\r\ncontributes but little to their full-blown complacency. But, when they\r\nhear that the Republic has been traduced by a foreign, and especially a\r\nBritish pen, their vanity is piqued, their curiosity excited, and their\r\nconscience smitten. Every one denounces the libel in public, and every\r\none admits its truth to himself--\"What!\" say they, \"does the Old World\r\nin truth judge us thus harshly? Is it really scandalised by such trifles\r\nas the repudiation of our debts, and the enslavement of our fellow\r\ncreatures? Must we give up our playful duels, and our convenient\r\nspittoons, before we can hope to pass muster as Christians and gentlemen\r\nbeyond our own borders? O free Demus! O wise Demus! O virtuous Demus!\r\nWill you betake yourself to cleanly, and well-ordered ways at the\r\nbidding of this scribbler?\" Thus \"they eat, and eke they swear;\" vowing\r\nall the time that they \"will horribly revenge.\" No doubt, however, the\r\nbitter pill of foreign animadversion, though distasteful to the palate,\r\nrelieves the inflation of their stomachs, and leaves them better and\r\nlighter than before. But when will a native Aristophanes arise to purge\r\nthe effeminacy of the American press, and show up the sausage-venders\r\nand Cleons of the Republic in their true light? How long will the\r\nrichest field of national folly in the world remain unreaped, save by\r\nthe crotchety sickles of dull moralists and didactic pamphleteers?\r\n\r\nNot that moral courage is entirely wanting in the United States; but it\r\nis a kind of courage altogether too moral, and sadly deficient in animal\r\nspirits. The New Englanders especially, set up, in their solemn way, to\r\nadmonish the vices of the Republic, and to inoculate them with the\r\nvirulent virtues of the Puritanical school. The good city of Boston\r\nalone teems with transcendental schemes for the total and immediate\r\nregeneration of mankind. There we find Peace Societies, and New Moral\r\nWorld Societies, and Teetotal Societies, and Anti-Slavery Societies, all\r\n\"in full blast,\" each opposing to its respective bane the most sweeping\r\nand exaggerated remedies. The Americans never do things by halves; their\r\nvices and their virtues are alike in extremes, and the principles of the\r\nsecond book of the Ethics of Aristotle[5] are altogether unknown to\r\ntheir philosophy. At one moment they are all for \"brandy and bitters,\"\r\nat the next, tea and turn-out is the order of the day, Here, you must\r\n\"liquor or fight\"--there, a little wine for the stomach's sake is\r\nsternly denied to a fit of colic, or an emergency of gripes. The moral\r\nsoul of Boston thrills with imaginings of perpetual peace, while St\r\nLouis and New Orleans are volcanoes of war. Listen to the voice of New\r\nEngland, and you would think that negro slavery was the only crime of\r\nwhich a nation ever was, or could by possibility be guilty; go to South\r\nCarolina, and you are instructed that \"the Domestic Institution\" is the\r\nbasis of democratic virtue, the cornerstone of the Republican edifice.\r\nCant, indeed, in one form or other, is the innate vice of the \"earnest\"\r\nAnglo-Saxon mind, on both sides of the Atlantic, and ridicule is the\r\nweapon which the gods have appointed for its mitigation. You must lay on\r\nthe rod with a will, and throw \"moral suasion\" to the dogs. Above all,\r\nyour demagogue dreads satire as vermin the avenging thumb--'Any thing\r\nbut that,' squeaks he, 'an you love me. Liken me to Lucifer, or Caius\r\nGracchus; charge me with ambition, and glorious vices; let me be the\r\nevil genius of the commonwealth, the tinsel villain of the political\r\nmelodrama; but don't threaten me with the fool's cap, or write me down\r\nwith Dogberry; above all, don't quote me in cold blood, that the foolish\r\npeople may see, after the fever heat has subsided, what trash I have\r\npalmed upon them in the name of liberty!' Yet this is the way, Jonathan,\r\nto deal with demagogues. You make too much of yours, man. You are not\r\nthe blockhead we take you for after all; but you delight to see your\r\npublic men in motley, and the rogues will fool you to the top of your\r\nbent, till it is your pleasure to put down the show. So now that the\r\npiper has to be paid, and a lucid interval appears to be dawning upon\r\nyou, to the pillory at once with these \"stump\" orators, and pot-house\r\npoliticians, who have led you into such silly scrapes; turn them about,\r\nand look at them well in the rough, that you may know them again when\r\nyou see them, and learn to avoid for the future their foolish and\r\nmischievous counsels.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that while a perception of the ridiculous, perhaps to\r\nexcess, is characteristic of the British mind, and is at the bottom of\r\nmany defects in the national manners, commonly attributed to less venial\r\nfeelings, our Transatlantic descendants err in just the opposite\r\ndirection. The Americans seldom laugh at any body, or any thing--never\r\nat themselves; and this, next to an unfortunate trick of insolvency, and\r\na preternatural abhorrence of niggers, is perhaps the besetting sin of\r\nan otherwise \"smart\" people. As individuals, their peculiarities are not\r\nvery marked; in truth there is a marvellous uniformity of bad habits\r\namongst them; but when viewed in their collective capacity, whenever two\r\nor three of them are gathered together, shades of Democritus! commend us\r\nto a seven-fold pocket-handkerchief. The humours of most nations expend\r\nthemselves on carnivals and feast-days, at the theatre, the ball-room,\r\nor the public garden; but the fun of the United States is to be looked\r\nfor at public meetings, and philanthropical gatherings, in the halls of\r\nlyceums, female academies, and legislative bodies. There they spout,\r\nthere they swell, and cover themselves with adulation as with a garment.\r\nFrom the inauguration of a President, to the anniversary of the fair\r\ngraduates of the Slickville female Institute, no event is allowed to\r\npass without a grand palaver, in which things in general are extensively\r\ndiscussed, and their own things in particular extensively praised. They\r\ngot the trick no doubt from us, whose performances in this line are\r\nquite unrivalled in the Old World, but they have added to our platform\r\ncommon-places a variety and \"damnable iteration\" entirely their own.\r\nBesides, when Bull is called upon to make an ass of himself on such\r\noccasions, he seems for the most part to have a due appreciation of the\r\nfact, while Jonathan's imperturbability and apparent good faith are\r\nquite sublime. The things that we have been compelled to hear of that\r\n\"star-spangled banner!\"--and all as if they were spoken in real earnest,\r\nand meant to be so understood. We look back upon those side-rending\r\nmoments with a kind of Lucretian pleasure, and indemnify ourselves for\r\npast constraint by a hearty guffaw. All this magniloquence and bad\r\ntaste, however, is intelligible enough. It springs partly from a want of\r\ndiscipline in their society, and partly from the absence of those\r\nstudies which purify the taste, enlighten the judgment, and make, even\r\ndulness respectable. American audiences are not critical--not merely\r\nbecause they are not learned, but because they all take it in turns to\r\nbe orators, as they do to be colonels of militia and justices of the\r\npeace. Thus they learn to bear each other's burdens, and Dulness is\r\nfully justified of her children. In a country where all men, at least in\r\ntheory, are equal, and where every man does in fact exercise a certain\r\ninfluence on public affairs, it is not surprising that a large number of\r\npersons should possess a certain facility of public speaking, which even\r\nin England is far from universal, and is elsewhere possessed by very\r\nfew. No man in the United States is deterred from offering his views\r\nupon matters of state, by the feeling that neither his education nor his\r\nposition justify his interference. It is difficult in England to realise\r\nthe practical equality which obtains as a fundamental principle in the\r\nRepublic. There every man feels himself to be, and in fact is, or at\r\nleast may be, a potential unit in the community. As a man, he is a\r\ncitizen--as a citizen, a sovereign, whose caprices are to be humoured,\r\nand whose displeasure is to be deprecated. Judge Peddle, for instance,\r\nfrom the backwoods, is not perhaps as eloquent as Webster, nor as\r\nsubtile as Calhoun, but he has just as good a right to be heard when he\r\ngoes up to Congress for all that. Is he not accounted an exemplary\r\ncitizen \"and a pretty tall talker\" in his own neighbourhood, and where\r\non \"the univarsal airth\" would you find a more enlightened public\r\nopinion? It would never do to put Peddle down; that would be\r\n_leze-majeste_ against his constituents, the sovereign people who dwell\r\nin Babylon, which is in the county of Lafayette, on the banks of the\r\nChattawichee. Thus endorsed, Peddle soon lays aside his native\r\nbashfulness, and makes the walls of Congress vocal to that bewitching\r\neloquence which heretofore captivated the Babylonish mind. He was\r\n\"raised a leettle too far to the west of sun-down\" to be snubbed by\r\nDown-easters, any how; he's a cock of the woods, he is; an \"etarnal\r\nscreamer,\" \"and that's a fact\"--with a bowie knife under his waistcoat,\r\nand a patent revolver in his coat pocket, both very much at the service\r\nof any gentleman who may dispute his claims to popular or personal\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nTo meet the case of these volcanic statesmen,\r\n\r\n    \"Aw'd by no shame, by no respect controll'd,\"\r\n\r\nand in order that the noble army of dunces (a potent majority, of\r\ncourse) may have no reason to complain that the principles of equality\r\nare violated in their persons, the House of Representatives has adopted\r\na regulation, commonly called \"the one-hour rule.\" Upon this principle,\r\nwhenever a question of great interest comes up, each member is allotted\r\none hour by the Speaker's watch--as much less as he pleases, but no more\r\non any consideration. Of course it occasionally happens that a man who\r\nhas something to say, is not able to say it effectively within the hour;\r\nbut then, for one such, there are at least a dozen who would otherwise\r\ntalk for a week without saying any thing at all. Upon the whole,\r\ntherefore, this same one-hour rule is deserving of all praise--the time\r\nof the country is saved by it, the sufferings of the more sensible\r\nmembers are abbreviated, while the dunces, to do them justice, make the\r\nmost of their limited opportunities. Who knows, but that the peace of\r\nthe world may be owing to it? For as there are about 230\r\nrepresentatives, we should have had, but for it, just as many masterly\r\ndemonstrations of the title of the Republic to the whole of Oregon--and\r\nsomething more. In such a cause, they would make nothing of beginning\r\nwith the creation of the world, and ending with the last protocol of Mr\r\nBuchanan! Decidedly, but for \"the one-hour rule\" we Britishers should\r\nhave been \"everlastingly used up--and no two ways about it.\" Poor old\r\nAdams actually did begin his Oregon speech with the first chapter of\r\nGenesis. The title-deeds of the Republic, he said, were to be found in\r\nthe words, \"Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth!\" Happily,\r\nthe fatal hammer of the Speaker put down the venerable antediluvian,\r\nbefore he got to the end of the chapter.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, on the other hand, which is a less numerous, and somewhat\r\nmore select body, things still go on in the old-fashioned way. There,\r\nwhen a member has once caught the Speaker's eye, his fortune is made for\r\nthe day--perhaps for the week. Accordingly, he takes things easy from\r\nthe very first--kicks his spittoon to a convenient angle, offers a\r\nlibation of cold water to his parched entrails, and begins. When he\r\nleaves off, is another matter altogether--but not generally till he has\r\ngone through the round of human knowledge, explored the past, touched\r\nlightly upon the present, and cast a piercing glance into the darkness\r\nof the future. Soon after three, the Senate adjourns for dinner, and the\r\norator of the day goes to his pudding with the rest, happy in the\r\nreflection that he has done his duty by his country, and will do it\r\nagain on the morrow. We have somewhere read of a paradise of fools.\r\nUndoubtedly, Congress is that place. There they enjoy a perfect\r\nimpunity, and revel in the full gratification of their instincts. Nobody\r\nthinks of coughing them down, or swamping them with ironical cheers.\r\nThere--\r\n\r\n    \"Dulness, with transport, eyes each lively dunce,\r\n    Remembering she herself was Pertness once,\r\n    And tinsel'd o'er in robes of varying hues,\r\n    With self-applause her wild creation views.\r\n    Sees momentary monsters rise and fall,\r\n    And with her own fool's colours gilds them all.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, all the arrangements of Congress favour the influence of the\r\nsable goddess. In the first place, the members are paid by the\r\nday--eight dollars each. Permit us to observe, Jonathan, that you\r\nscarcely display your usual \"smartness\" here. It would be much better to\r\ncontract with them by the _scrape_. As for instance--To involving the\r\ncountry in a war with Mexico, so much--To ditto with Great Britain, so\r\nmuch more. One year you might lay down a lumping sum for a protective\r\ntariff, with an understanding, that it was to be repealed the next at a\r\nmoderate advance. You would thus insure the greatest possible variety of\r\npolitical catastrophes, with the least possible friction and expense.\r\nAgain, the furniture of the Capitol is altogether too luxurious. Each\r\nmember is provided with a private desk, stationery _ad lib._, a stuffed\r\narm-chair, and a particular spittoon. No wonder, then, that your Simmses\r\nand Chipmans are listened to with complacency. It's all in the day's\r\nwork--it's considered in the wages. While these worthies hold forth for\r\nthe benefit of distant Missouri and Michigan, their colleagues write\r\ntheir letters, read the newspapers, chew tobacco, as little boys do\r\ntoffy in England, and expectorate at leisure. No one cheers, no one\r\ngroans, no one cries Oh! Oh!--all the noise that is made is on private\r\naccount, and not at all personal to the gentleman on his legs. Yet, such\r\nis the deceitfulness of the human heart, that the Americans are much\r\ngiven to boast of the dignity and decorum of their Legislature, and to\r\nthank God that it is not a bear-garden like another place of the kind\r\nthat they wot of. We must have been asked at least six times a-day\r\nduring our visit at Washington, \"How Congress compared with the British\r\nParliament?\" To which we used to reply, \"That they did not compare at\r\nall,\" an answer which fully met the truth of the case, without in the\r\nleast wounding the self-love of the querist.\r\n\r\nWhen these malignant pages arrive in New York, every inhabitant of that\r\ngood city will abuse us heartily, except our publisher. But great will\r\nbe the joy of that furacious individual, as he speculates in secret on\r\nthe increased demand of his agonised public. Immediately he will put\r\nforth an advertisement, notifying the men of \"Gotham,\" that he has on\r\nhand a fresh sample of BRITISH INSOLENCE, and hinting that, although he\r\nknows they care nothing about such things, the forthcoming piracy of\r\nMaga will be on the most extensive scale. Then, all the little\r\nnewspapers will take us in hand, and bully us in their little way. It is\r\nperhaps a shame to forestall the acerbities of these ingenious\r\ngentlemen, but we know they will call us \"anonymous scribbler,\" and\r\n\"bagman,\" amongst the rest. They called us \"bagman\" for our last\r\narticle, and we were sure they would. The fact is, that since Lord\r\nMorpeth's visit to the United States, the Americans have taken a very\r\nhigh tone indeed. Their gratitude to that amiable nobleman for not\r\nwriting a book about them, is unbounded, and they put him down (why, it\r\nis difficult to say) as the aristocratic, and therefore impartial\r\nchampion of Demus. Whenever we fell into the bilious moods to which our\r\nplebeian nature is addicted, we were gravely admonished of his bright\r\nexample, and assured that to speak evil of the Republic was the\r\ninfirmity of vulgar minds. There is, it would appear, a sympathy betwixt\r\n\"great ones;\" a kind of free-masonry betwixt the sovereign people and\r\nthe British peerage, which neither party suspected previously, but which\r\nis confessed on the slightest acquaintance.\r\n\r\nAs generally happens in such cases, the conceit of the Americans takes\r\nthe most perverse direction. It is certain that they do many things\r\nbetter than any people under the sun. Their merchant navy is the finest\r\nin the world--their river steamers are miracles of ingenuity,--at\r\nfelling timber and packing pork they are unrivalled; and their smartness\r\nin the way of trade is acknowledged by those who know them best. All\r\nthis, and much more to the same effect, may be admitted without demur,\r\nbut all these admissions will avail the traveller nothing. He will be\r\nexpected to congratulate them on the elegance of their manners, the\r\ncopiousness of their literature, and the refinement of their tastes. He\r\nwill be confidentially informed that \"Lord Morpeth's manners were much\r\nimproved by mixing with our first circles, sir;\" and what is worse, he\r\nwill be expected to believe it, and to carry himself accordingly. \"Ripe\r\nscholars\" who make awful false quantities, second-rate demagogues\r\npassing for \"distinguished statesmen,\" literary empirics, under the name\r\nof \"men of power,\" will claim his suffrages at every turn; and in vain\r\nwill he draw upon his politeness to the utmost, in vain assent,\r\nejaculate, and admire--no amount of positive praise will suffice, till\r\nAmerica Felix is admitted to be the chosen home of every grace and every\r\nmuse. \"Did Mr Bull meet with any of _our_ literary characters at\r\nBoston?\" Mr Bull had that happiness. \"Well, he was very much pleased of\r\ncourse?\" Bull hastens to lay his hand upon his heart, and to reply with\r\ntruth that he _was_ pleased. \"Yes, sir, we do expect that our Boston\r\nliterature is about first-rate. We are a young people, sir, but we are a\r\ngreat people, and we are bound to be greater still. There is a moral\r\npower, sir, an elevation about the New England mind, which\r\nEuropeans can scarcely realise. Did you hear Snooks lecture, sir?\r\nthe Rev. Amos Snooks of Pisgah? Well, sir, you ought to have heard\r\nSnooks. All Europeans calculate to hear Snooks--he's a fine man,\r\nsir, a man of power--one of the greatest men, sir, in this, or perhaps\r\nany other country.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Semper ego auditor tantum, nunquam ne reponam,\r\n    Vexatus toties.\"----\r\n\r\nYou leave Boston somewhat snubbed and subdued, and betake yourself to\r\nthe more cosmopolitan regions of New York. Here, too, \"men of power\" are\r\nto be found in great numbers--but \"our first circles\" divide the\r\nattention and abuse the patience of the traveller. Boston writes the\r\nbooks, but New York sets the fashions of the Republic, and is the\r\nElysium of mantua-makers and upholders. We doubt whether any city in the\r\nworld of its size can boast so many smart drawing rooms and so many\r\npretty young women. Indeed, from the age of fifteen to that of\r\nfive-and-twenty, female beauty is the rule rather than the exception in\r\nthe United States, and neither cost nor pains are spared to set it forth\r\nto the best advantage. The American women dress well, dance well, and in\r\nall that relates to what may be called the mechanical part of social\r\nintercourse, they appear to great advantage. Nothing can exceed the\r\nself-possession of these pretty creatures, whose confidence is never\r\nchecked by the discipline of society, or the restraints of an education\r\nwhich is terminated almost as soon as it is begun. There is no childhood\r\nin America--no youth--no freshness. We look in vain for the\r\n\r\n    \"Ingenui vultus puer, ingenuique pudoris.\"\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    \"The modest maid deck'd with a blush of honour,\r\n    Whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love.\"\r\n\r\n    DANIEL.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a step from the school to the forum--from the nursery\r\nto the world. Young girls, who in England would be all blushes and bread\r\nand butter, boldly precede their mammas into the ball-room; and the code\r\nof a mistaken gallantry supplies no corrective to their caprice, for\r\nyouth and beauty are here invested with regal prerogatives, and can do\r\nno wrong. In short, the Americans carry their complaisance to the sex\r\nbeyond due bounds--at least in little things--for we by no means think\r\nthat the real influence of their women is great, notwithstanding the\r\ntame and submissive gallantry with which the latter are treated in\r\npublic. We doubt whether the most limited gynocracy would tolerate the\r\nuse of tobacco as an article of daily diet, or permit ferocious murders\r\nto go unwhipped of justice under the name of duels. But the absorbing\r\ncharacter of the pursuits of the men forbids any strong sympathy betwixt\r\nthe sexes; and perhaps the despotism which the women exercise in the\r\ndrawing-room arises from the fact that all that relates to the graces\r\nand embellishments of life is left entirely to them. We do not know\r\nthat this can be avoided under the circumstances of the country, but it\r\nhas a most injurious effect upon social intercourse. The Americans of\r\nboth sexes want tact and graciousness of manner, and that prompt and\r\nspontaneous courtesy which is the child of discipline and\r\nself-restraint. They are seldom absolutely awkward, because they are\r\nnever bashful; they have no _mauvaise honte_, because they are all on an\r\nequality; hence they never fail to display a certain dry composure of\r\nbearing, which, though not agreeable, is less ludicrous than the\r\n_gaucherie_ so commonly observed in all classes of English society,\r\nexcept the very highest.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe how the manners of two nations of the same\r\norigin, and, in a great degree, of similar instincts, are modified by\r\ntheir political institutions. Neither the British nor the Americans are\r\ndistinguished for that natural politeness and _savoir vivre_, which is\r\nto be found more or less in all other civilised countries. They are both\r\ntoo grave, too busy, and too ambitious to lay themselves out for\r\ntrifles, which, after all, go far to make up the sum of human happiness.\r\nAs for the Americans, the general aspect of their society is dreary and\r\nmonotonous in the extreme. Whatever \"our first circles\" may say to the\r\ncontrary, there is a great equality of manners, as of other things,\r\namongst them; but if the standard is nowhere very high, it never falls\r\nso low as with us; if there is less refinement and cultivation amongst\r\nthe higher classes, (we beg Demus' pardon for the expression,) there is\r\non the other hand less grossness, certainly less clownishness, among the\r\nmass. Of course there are many individuals in this, as in other\r\ncountries, remarkable for natural grace and genteel bearing; but the\r\nclass which is pre-eminent in these respects, is very small and\r\nill-defined. The great national defect is a want of sprightliness and\r\nvivacity, and an impartial _insouciance_ in their intercourse with all\r\nclasses and conditions of men. For if inequality has its evils, it has\r\nalso its charms; as the prospect of swelling mountains and lowly vales\r\nis more pleasing to the eye than that of the monotonous, though more\r\nfertile champaign. Now, as the relation of patrician and plebeian, of\r\npatron and client, of master and servant, of superior and inferior, can\r\nscarcely be said to exist in the United States, so all the nice\r\ngradations of manner which are elicited by those relations, are wanting\r\nalso. The social machine rubs on with as little oil as possible--there\r\nis but small room for the exercise of the amenities and charities of\r\nlife. The favours of the great are seldom rewarded by the obsequiousness\r\nof the small. No leisure and privileged class exists to set an example\r\nof refined and courtly bearing; but there are none, however humble, who\r\nmay not affect the manners of their betters without impertinence, and\r\naspire to the average standard of the Republic. Hence, almost every\r\nnative American citizen is capable of conducting himself with propriety,\r\nif not with ease, in general society. What are fine ladies and gentlemen\r\nto him, that he should stand in awe of them? Simply persons who have\r\nbeen smarter or earlier in the field of fortune than himself, who will\r\n\"burst up\" some fine morning, and leave the road open to others. The\r\nprinciple of rotation[6] is not confined to the political world of the\r\nUnited States, but obtains in every department of life. It is throughout\r\nthe same song--\r\n\r\n    \"Here we go up, up, up,\r\n    And here we go down, down, down.\"\r\n\r\nLaw and opinion, and the circumstances of the country, are alike\r\nopposed to the accumulation of property, so that it is rare for two\r\nsuccessive generations of the same family to occupy the same social\r\nposition. The ease with which fortunes are made, or repaired, is only\r\nequalled by the recklessness with which they are lost. Prosperity, at\r\nsome time or other, appears to be the birth-right of every citizen; and,\r\nwhere all are _parvenus_ alike, there are none to assume the airs of\r\nexclusiveness, or to crush the last comer beneath the weight of\r\ntraditional and time-honoured grandeur.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to dismiss the peculiarities of our British society in a\r\nparagraph. Bull, however, to be appreciated, must be seen in the midst\r\nof his own household gods, with his family and bosom friends about him.\r\nThis is what may be called the normal state of that fine fellow--and\r\nhere Jonathan can't hold a candle to him. American interiors want relief\r\nand variety of colouring. Their children are not like the children of\r\nthe Old World: they don't romp, or prattle, or get into mischief, or\r\nbelieve in Bogie. They seem to take brevet rank, from the first, as men\r\nand women, and are quite inaccessible to nursery humbug of any kind.\r\nThey are never whipped, and eat as much pastry as they think proper;\r\nwhereby they grow up dyspeptic and rational beyond their years. Parents\r\ndon't appear to exercise any particular functions, masters (we again beg\r\nDemus's pardon for the poverty of the vernacular) have nothing\r\nmagisterial about them, and servants won't stomach even the name, at\r\nleast if they wear white skins, and know it. After the first burst of\r\nadmiration at the philosophy of the thing, it grows tiresome to live\r\namongst people who are all so much alike. Now in England the\r\ndistinctions of age, and rank, and sex, are much more strongly marked;\r\nwhile in those countries of Europe which are still less under the\r\ninfluence of the equalising spirit of the age, the social landscape is\r\nstill more variegated and picturesque. With us, two adverse principles\r\nare at work; and this is the reason why our British society is so\r\nanomalous to ourselves, and so entirely beyond the comprehension of\r\nforeigners. Whenever our brave Bull is thrown into a mixed company\r\nabroad, or even at home, where the social position of those with whom he\r\nis brought into contact is unknown to him, there is no end to the\r\nblundering and nonsense of the worthy fellow. Go where he will, he is\r\nhaunted by the traditions of his eccentric island, and desperately\r\nafraid of placing himself in what he calls a false position. At home, he\r\nhas one manner for his nobleman, another for his tradesman, another for\r\nhis valet; and he would rather die than fail in the orthodox intonation\r\nappropriate to each. Who has not observed the strange mixture of\r\npetulance and _mauvaise honte_ which distinguishes so many of our\r\nEnglish travellers on the Continent? Decidedly, we appear to less\r\nadvantage in public than any people in the world. Place a Briton and an\r\nAmerican, of average parts and breeding, on board a Rhine steam-boat,\r\nand it is almost certain that the Yankee will mix up, so to speak, the\r\nbetter of the two. The gregarious habits of our continental neighbours\r\nare more familiar to him than to his insular kinsman, and he is not\r\ntormented like the latter by the perpetual fear of failing, either in\r\nwhat is due to himself or to others. His manners will probably want\r\npolish and dignity; he will be easy rather than graceful, communicative\r\nrather than affable; but he will at least preserve his Republican\r\ncomposure, alike in his intercourse with common humanity, or in the\r\natmosphere of more courtly and exclusive circles.\r\n\r\nThe art of pleasing is nowhere well understood in the United States: but\r\nthe beauty of the women, though transient, is unrivalled while it lasts,\r\nand perhaps in no country is the standard of female virtue so high. The\r\nformal and exaggerated attention which the sex receives from all classes\r\nin public, is at least a proof of the high estimation in which it is\r\nheld, and must, we think, be put down as an amiable trait in the\r\nAmerican character.\r\n\r\nWe are quite sure, for instance, that females may travel unattended in\r\nthe United States with far more ease and security than in any country of\r\nthe Old World: and the deference paid to them is quite irrespective of\r\nthe rank of the fair objects--it is a tribute paid to the _woman_ and\r\nnot to the _lady_. Some travellers we believe have denied this. We can\r\nonly say, that during a pretty extensive tour we do not recollect a\r\nsingle instance in which even the unreasonable wishes of women were not\r\ncomplied with as of course. We _did_ remark with less satisfaction the\r\nungracious manner in which civilities were received by these spoilt\r\nchildren of the Republic--the absence of apologetic phrases, and those\r\ncourtesies of voice and expression, with which women usually acknowledge\r\nthe deference paid to their weakness and their charms. But this is a\r\nnational failing. The Americans are too independent to confess a sense\r\nof obligation, even in the little conventional matters of daily\r\nintercourse. They have almost banished from the language such phrases\r\nas, \"Thank you,\" \"If you please,\" \"I beg your pardon,\" and the like. The\r\nFrench, who are not half so attentive to women as the Americans, pass\r\nfor the politest nation in Europe, because they know how to veil their\r\nselfishness beneath a profusion of bows and pretty speeches. Now, when\r\nyour Yankee is invited to surrender his snug seat in a stage or a\r\nrailroad carriage in favour of a fair voyager, he does not hesitate for\r\na moment. He expectorates, and retires at once. But no civilities are\r\ninterchanged; no smiles or bows pass betwixt the parties. The gentleman\r\nexpresses no satisfaction--the lady murmurs no apologies.\r\n\r\nEven now we see in our mind's eye the pert, pretty little faces, and the\r\nloves of bonnets which flirt and flutter along Broadway in the bright\r\nsunshine--_Longum Vale_! In the flesh we shall see them no more. No more\r\noysters at Downing's, no more terrapins at Florence's, no more fugacious\r\nbanquets at the Astor House. We have traduced the State, and for us\r\nthere is no return. The commercial house which we represent, has offered\r\nto renew its confidence, but it has failed to restore ours. No amount of\r\ncommission whatever, will tempt us to affront the awful majesty of\r\nLynch, or to expose ourselves to the tar-and-feathery tortures which he\r\nprepares for those who blaspheme the Republic. We have ordered our buggy\r\nfor the Home Circuit, and propose, by a course of deliberate\r\nmastication, and unlimited freedom of speech, to repair the damage which\r\nour digestion, and we fear our temper, has sustained during our travels\r\nin \"the area of freedom.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] [Greek: Estig ara e arete exisproaixetikt, en mesotetizusa te pros\r\nemas orismene dogo]\r\n\r\n[6] The principle of rotation in office is a favourite crochet of the\r\nDemocratic party, and is founded upon the Republican jealousy of power.\r\nGeneral Jackson went so far as to recommend that all official\r\nappointments whatever should be limited by law to the Presidential term\r\nof four years. As it is, whenever a change of parties occurs, a clean\r\nsweep is made of all the officers of government, from the highest to the\r\nlowest. Custom-house officers, jailers, &c., all share the fate of their\r\nbetters. It is only surprising that the business of the country is\r\ncarried on as well as it is, under the influence of this corrupting\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHORAE CATULLIANAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER TO EUSEBIUS.\r\n\r\nYou are far more anxious, my dear Eusebius, to know somewhat of the\r\nprogress or the result of the Curate's misfortune, than to read his or\r\nmy translations from Catullus. I have a great mind to punish that love\r\nof mischief in you, by burying the whole affair in profound secresy. It\r\nis fortunate for him that you are not here, or you would surely indulge\r\nyour propensity, and with malicious invention put the whole parish, with\r\nthe Curate, into inextricable confusion. It is bad enough as it is.\r\nThere!--it cannot be helped--I must tell you at once the condition we\r\nare in, if I would have you read the rest of my letter with any\r\npatience.\r\n\r\nA committee has been sitting these two days, to sift, as they pronounce\r\nthem, \"the late disgraceful proceedings;\" so that you see, they are of\r\nthe school of Rhadamanthus,--condemn first, and hear afterwards. We\r\nhave, in this little township, two \"general shopkeepers,\" dealers in\r\ngroceries, mops, calicoes, candles, and the usual \"_omnium-gatherum_\" of\r\nhousehold requirements.\r\n\r\nThese are great rivals--envious rivals--back-biting rivals; both, in the\r\nway of tale-bearing, what Autolicus calls himself, \"pickers-up of\r\nunconsidered trifles.\" And truly, in the trade of this commodity, if in\r\nno other, this may be called a \"manufacturing district.\" Now the Curate,\r\nunhappily, can buy his tea and sugar, and trifling matters, but of\r\none--for to patronise both, would be to make enemies of both; the poor\r\nCurate, then, in preferring the adulterated goods of Nicolas Sandwell,\r\nto the adulterated goods of Matthew Miffins, has made an implacable\r\nenemy. Really, Eusebius, here is machinery enough for a heroic poem: for\r\nVirgil's old Lady Fame on the top of the roof we have three, active and\r\nlusty--and you may make them the Fates or the Furies, or what you\r\nplease, except the Graces. Prateapace, Gadabout, and Brazenstare--there\r\nare characters enough for episodes; and a hero--but what, you will say,\r\nare we to do for a heroine? Here is one, beat out of the brain of Mathew\r\nMiffins, a ready-armed Minerva. You will smile, but it is so. The three\r\nabove-named ladies first made their way to the shop of Mr Miffins,\r\nnarrated what had passed and what had not. Having probably just\r\ncompleted \"sanding the sugar and watering the tobacco,\" he raised both\r\nhis hands and his eyes, and, to lose no time in business, dropped them\r\nas soon as he decently could, and, pressing both palms strongly on the\r\ncounter, he asked, if they entertained any suspicion of a particular\r\nperson as being the object of the Curate's most unbecoming passion?\r\nLydia Prateapace remembered, certainly, a name being mentioned--it was\r\nLesby or Lisby, or something like that. \"Indeed!\" said Miffins, arching\r\nhis brows, and significantly touching the tip of his nose with his\r\nforefinger--\"ah! indeed! a foreigner, depend upon it--a Lisbon lady;\r\nthat, Miss, is the capital of Portugal, where them figs comes from. Only\r\nthink, a foreign lady--a lady from Lisbon--that is too bad!\" to which\r\nthe three readily assented. \"I doubt not, ladies,\" he continued, \"it's\r\none of them foreigners as lives near Ashford, about five miles\r\noff--where I knows the Curate goes two or three times in a week.\"\r\n\r\nThus, Eusebius, is Catullus's Lesbia, who herself stood for another,\r\nconverted into a Portuguese lady, whom the Curate visits some five miles\r\noff--or, as the three ladies say, _protects_.\r\n\r\nIf you ask how I came by this accurate information, learn that our\r\nGratian's _Jahn_ was at the further counter, making a purchase of\r\nmole-traps, and saw and heard, and reported. The first meeting was held\r\nin Miffins' back-parlour; but fame had beat up for recruits, and that\r\nwas found far too small; so they have adjourned to the Blue Boar, where,\r\nthe tap being good, and the landlord a busybody, they are likely to\r\nremain a little longer than Muzzle-brains can see to draw up a report.\r\nThe Curate's door is chalked, and adjacent walls--\"No Kissing,\" \"The\r\nClerical Judas,\" \"Who Kissed the School-mistress?\" and many such-like\r\nmorsels. But if fame has thus been playing with the kaleidoscope of\r\nlies, multiplying and giving every one its match, she has likewise shown\r\nthem about through her magnifying glass, and brought the most distantly\r\ncirculated home to the poor Curate. In a little town a few miles off, it\r\nhas been reported that Miss Lydia Prateapace has been obliged to \"swear\r\nthe peace against him,\" which \"swearing the _peace_\" is, in most cases,\r\na declaration of _war_.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Curate has taken his cue, to do nothing and say nothing\r\nupon the subject; and, as in all his misadventures, that was the part\r\ntaken by Yorick, if his friends do not rescue him, he may have Yorick's\r\npenalty. Thus much at present, my dear Eusebius; I will occasionally\r\nreport progress, but it is now time that we resume our translations,\r\nhoping you will find amusement in our\r\n\r\n\r\nHORAE CATULLIANAE.\r\n\r\nI told you Gratian, worthy veracious Gratian, had hastened away to an\r\nAgricultural meeting, to vindicate the character of his Belgian carrots.\r\nThis vindication inundated us for some days with agricultural visitors.\r\nAnd Gratian was proud, and, like Virgil, \"tossed about the dung with\r\ndignity.\" We saw little of him, and when he did appear, \"his talk was of\r\nbullocks;\" so how could he \"have understanding,\" at least for Catullus?\r\nHad not a neighbouring fair taken off the agriculturists after a few\r\ndays, his ideas, like his stick, would have become porcine. He rode his\r\nhobby, and at a brisk pace; and, when a little tired of him, stabled him\r\nand littered him, and seemed glad of a little quiet and leg-tapping in\r\nhis easy-chair. He had worked off the lessened excitement by an\r\nevening's nap, and awoke recruited; and, with a pleasant smile, asked\r\nthe Curate if he had had recently any communication with his friend\r\nCatullus.\r\n\r\nCURATE.--We left him, I believe, in the very glory of kissing--his\r\ninsatiable glory. He now comes to a check--Lesbia is weary, if he is\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--It is a mere lovers' quarrel, and is only the prelude to more\r\nfolly, like the blank green baize curtain, between the play and the\r\nfarce. He affects anger--a thin disguise: he would give worlds to \"kiss\r\nand be friends again.\" His vexation is evident.\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--Ah! it is an old story--and not the worse for that--come, Mr\r\nCurate, show up Catullus in his true motley. He was privileged at his\r\nage to play the fool--so are we all at one time or another, if we do it\r\nnot too wisely. A wise fool is the only Asinine.--Now for Catullus's\r\nfolly.\r\n\r\nCURATE.--Thus, then, to himself:--\r\n\r\n    AD CATULLUM.\r\n\r\n    Sad Catullus, cease your moan,\r\n      Or your folly you'll deplore;\r\n    What you see no more your own,\r\n      Think of as your own no more.\r\n\r\n    Once the suns shone on you clearly,\r\n      When it was your wont to go\r\n    Seeking her you loved so dearly,--\r\n      Will you e'er love woman so?\r\n\r\n    Then those coquetries amusing\r\n      Were consented to by both--\r\n    Done at least of your free choosing,\r\n      Nor was she so very loth.\r\n\r\n    Then, indeed, the suns shone clearly,\r\n      Now their light is half gone out;\r\n    She is loth--and you can merely\r\n      Learn the way to do without.\r\n\r\n    Cease, then, your untimely wooing,\r\n      Steel your purpose, and be strong;\r\n    If she flies you, why, pursuing,\r\n      Make your sorrow vain and long?\r\n\r\n    Farewell, Fair!--Catullus hardens;\r\n      Where he is, will he remain;\r\n    He is not a man who pardons\r\n      One that must be asked again.\r\n\r\n    She'll be sad in turn, the charmer,\r\n      When the shades of eventide\r\n    Bring no gallants to alarm her,\r\n      No Catullus to her side.\r\n\r\n    Lost to every sense of duty,\r\n      Say, what can you, will you do?\r\n    Who'll find out that you have beauty?\r\n      Who'll be loved in turn by you?\r\n\r\n    Whose will you be called of right?\r\n      Whom will you in future kiss?\r\n    Whose lips will you have to bite?--\r\n      O Catullus, keep to this!\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--Well, now, I think your choice of metre a little too much of\r\nthe measured elegiac, for the bursts of alternate passion, love, and\r\nanger--those sudden breaks of vexation, which I see, or fancy I see, in\r\nthe original Latin. Now, Aquilius, let us hear you personate the \"vexed\r\nlover.\"\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.\r\n\r\n    AD SEIPSUM.\r\n\r\n    Foolish Catullus--trifling ever--\r\n    Dismiss so fruitless an endeavour;\r\n    Let by-gone days be days by-gone,\r\n    Though fine enough some days have shone,--\r\n    When if _she_ but held up her finger\r\n    Whom you so loved--and still you linger,\r\n    Nor dare to part with--you observant,\r\n    Were at her beck her humble servant;\r\n    Follow'd her here and there: and did\r\n    Such things! which she would not forbid--\r\n    Love's follies, without stint or doubt:\r\n    Oh! then your days shone finely out.\r\n    But now 'tis quite another thing,--\r\n    She likes not your philandering:\r\n    And you yourself! But be it over--\r\n    Act not again the silly lover--\r\n    But let her go--be hard as stone;\r\n    So let her go--and go alone.\r\n    Adieu, sweet lady! 'Tis in vain!\r\n    Catullus is himself again--\r\n    Will neither love, want, nor require,\r\n    But gives you up as you desire.\r\n    Wretch! you will grieve for this full sore,\r\n    When lovers come to you no more.\r\n    For think you, false one, to what pass,\r\n    Your wretched days will come? Alas!\r\n    No beauty yours--not one to say\r\n    How beautiful she looks to-day!\r\n    Whom will you have to love--to hear\r\n    Yourself called by _his_ name, _his_ dear?\r\n    Whom will you have to kiss,--be kiss'd\r\n    And bind your names, in true-love twist?\r\n    Whose lips to bite so?--yes--to bite.}\r\n    --Catullus, spare thy love or spite:}\r\n    Be firm as rock--or conquered quite.}\r\n\r\nCURATE.--I protest against this as a translation. He has indeed, as he\r\nprofessed, brought his puppet Catullus upon the stage, and, like\r\nShakspeare's bad actor, has put more words in his mouth than the author\r\nbargained for. The very last words are quite contradicted by the text.\r\nCatullus does not hint at the possibility of being conquered, of giving\r\nin.\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--Oh! that, is always implied in these cases. Besides Catullus\r\nevidently doubts, or he would not have so enforced the caution; \"At tu,\r\nCatulle\"--the translation may be a little free, but still admissible.\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--My friend the Curate has committed the fault himself, if it\r\nbe one: his \"O Catullus, keep to this!\" so evidently means, If you do\r\nnot, it is all over with you.\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--Give me the book.--Oh!--I see we have next that very elegant\r\nand very affectionate welcome home to his friend Verannius, on his\r\nreturn from Spain, whither he had gone with Caius Piso. There is much\r\nheart in it, and true joy and gratulation. This is the sort of welcome\r\nthat throws a sunshine upon the path of the days of human life. There is\r\nno trouble when friend greets friend. Have you translated this?\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--I fear your commendation will resemble too rich a frame to a\r\npoor picture, and make all more dingy by the glow of the genuine gold.\r\n\r\nBut here I venture to offer, my translation:--the warmth of the\r\noriginal--the tenderness, is not perhaps in it:\r\n\r\n    AD VERANNIUM.\r\n\r\n    Sweet friend, Verannius, welcome home at last!\r\n    Had I a thousand friends, all were surpass'd\r\n    By my Verannius! Art thou _home_ return'd,\r\n    To thine own household gods, and hearts that yearn'd\r\n    To greet thee--brothers happy in one mind,\r\n    And thy dear mother, too,--all fond, all kind?\r\n    O happy, happy news! and now again\r\n    To see thee safe! and hear thee talk of Spain--\r\n    Its history, places, people, and array,\r\n    Telling of all in thy old pleasant way!\r\n    And shall I hold thee in a friend's embrace,\r\n    Gaze on thy mouth, and in thine eyes, and trace\r\n    The features of the well-remember'd face!\r\n    Oh, if one happiest man on earth there be,\r\n    Amongst the happy, I, dear friend, am he!\r\n\r\nCURATE.--This Verannius, and his friend Fabullus, seem to have been upon\r\nthe most intimate and familiar terms with our poet. Little presents,\r\npledges of their mutual friendship, had doubtless been given and\r\nreceived. Catullus elsewhere complains against Marrucinus Asinius, that\r\nhe had stolen a handkerchief, sent him out of Spain by Verannius and\r\nFabullus.\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--Have you not translated it?\r\n\r\nCURATE.--No.\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--I have, and will read it, after yours to Verannius: and it is\r\ncurious as showing that the Romans had the practice of using\r\nhandkerchiefs, or napkins, of value,--perhaps such a fashion as is now\r\nrevived by the other sex,--and embroidered with lace.\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--Now, Mr Curate.--If you let our friend digress thus, we shall\r\nnever have your version.\r\n\r\nCURATE.--\r\n\r\n    AD VERANNIUM.\r\n\r\n    My friend, the dearest and the best,\r\n    E'en though ten thousand I possess'd!--\r\n    My own Verannius! art thou come\r\n    To greet again thy gods of home,\r\n    And brethren that so well agree\r\n    Together, and in loving thee--\r\n    And come to thy sweet mother, too?\r\n    O blessed news! and it is true,\r\n    That I shall see thee safe at last;\r\n    And hear thee tell thy travel pass'd--\r\n    Of Spanish places, things, and tribes,\r\n    (While every word my heart imbibes,)\r\n    In thine old way: shall I embrace\r\n    Thy neck--and kiss thy pleasant face?\r\n    Find me the happy where you can,\r\n    I still shall be the happiest man.\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--What are we to have next?\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--An invitation to dinner, or, as the Romans made it,\r\nsupper--and a curious invitation it is. Fabullus, to whom it was\r\naddressed, was companion to his friend Verannius--and both were with the\r\npestilent Piso, in Spain.\r\n\r\nCURATE.--And brought little out of it; but returned poorer than they\r\nwent--as did, it should seem, Catullus himself from Bithynia. So that I\r\nshould imagine the invitation to Fabullus was a mere jest upon their\r\nmutual poverty. For it does not appear that Fabullus was in a condition\r\nto indulge in luxuries.\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--Perhaps, when the invitation was sent, Catullus was not aware\r\nthat his friend had been as unsuccessful, under Piso, as he had himself\r\nbeen, under Memmius. Thus stands the invitation:--\r\n\r\n    AD FABULLUM.\r\n\r\n    A few days hence, my dear Fabullus,\r\n      If the gods grant you that high favour,\r\n    You shall sup well with your Catullus;\r\n      For, to ensure the dishes' savour,\r\n    Yourself shall cater, and shall cull us\r\n      Best fruits--and wines of choicest flavour.\r\n    And with you bring your lass--fun--laughter--\r\n      All plenty: nor confine your wishes\r\n      To supernumerary dishes;--\r\n    Bring all--and pay the piper after.\r\n    Rich be your fare--and all fruition,\r\n      Taste, elegance, and sweet discourses\r\n    Familiar, on that one condition.\r\n      For, truth to tell, my wretched purse is\r\n    In its last stage of inanition,\r\n      And not a single coin disburses:\r\n    A cobweb's over it, and in it--\r\n    That Spider Want there loves to spin it.\r\n\r\n    Setting aside this lack of coffer,\r\n      Which you can supply, Fabullus,\r\n    Accept good welcome--and I offer,\r\n      For company, your friend Catullus.\r\n    Yet, though so hard my purse's case is,\r\n      With such rare unguents I'll present you,\r\n    Compounded by the Loves and Graces\r\n      For my dear girl, that you shall scent you\r\n    With perfume more divine than roses;\r\n      And after, pray the gods, within you,\r\n      To change sense, nerve, bone, muscle, sinew,\r\n    And make you all compact of noses.\r\n\r\nCURATE.--There you are again bolting out of the course. Sending poor\r\nFabullus to market, without money in his purse,--not a word in the\r\noriginal of fruit-culling and \"paying the piper.\"\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--If Gratian had not the book in his hand, I would boldly\r\nassert that it is all there. He will admit it is the entire meaning.\r\n\r\nCURATE.--With the elegant diction, \"paying the piper,\" indeed! \"Haec si,\r\ninquam, attuleris, venuste noster.\"\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--Well, I almost think \"venuste noster,\" \"my good fellow,\" or\r\n\"my pleasant fellow,\" will allow the freedom of the translation, for it\r\nis a free and easy appellative. Come, then, Curate, let us have your\r\naccurate version.\r\n\r\nCURATE.--Perhaps you may think, when you hear it, that I am in the same\r\npredicament of blame with Aquilius, and that my criticism was a ruse, to\r\ndivide the censure pretty equally.\r\n\r\n    AD FABULLUM.\r\n\r\n    Fabullus, if the gods will let you,\r\n    Before a table I will set you,\r\n    A few days hence, with welcome hearty,\r\n    To my domestic dinner-party.\r\n    That is to say--you bring the food,\r\n    (Which must be plentiful and good,)\r\n    With wine--remembering, I presume,\r\n    For one fair girl I've always room.\r\n    On these conditions you shall dine\r\n    Luxurious, boon-companion mine.\r\n    Seeing that your Catullus' purse\r\n    Has nought but cobwebs left to nurse,\r\n    I can but give you in return\r\n    The loves that undiluted burn;\r\n    And, something sweeter, neater still--\r\n      A scented unguent I'll impart,\r\n    Which Venus and her Loves distil\r\n      To please the girl that owns my heart:\r\n    Which when you smell, this boon--this solely\r\n      You'll ask the gods to recompose;\r\n    And metamorphose you, and wholly,\r\n      To one extensive Roman nose.\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--What nose would a Roman wish to have? I object to Roman,\r\nthough it is not a bad one for the purpose. The metamorphosed would\r\ncertainly have a ballad written on him and sung about the streets. Write\r\nit, and call him \"The Man-mountain, or real and undoubted Promontory of\r\nNoses.\"\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--It should seem they were like enough to feast--like their gods\r\nthey so irreverently prayed to--on the smell and the smoke only; so they\r\nneeded good noses and bad appetites. There is something a little abrupt\r\nin the latter part, which I doubt if I like: the Loves and Graces should\r\nnot be made parties to the making of such a monster; and as _monster_ is\r\nnow-a-days all adopted adjective, follow the fashion of speech, and call\r\nit \"One extensive Monster-Nose.\"--Well, what next?\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--A little piece of extravagant badinage. It seems Calvus\r\nLicinius had sent Catullus a collection of miserable poems, and that,\r\ntoo, on commencement of the Saturnalia, dedicated to joy, and freedom\r\nfrom care and annoyance. Our author writes to complain of the malicious\r\npresent. There is some force, and a fair fling of contempt at the bad\r\npoets of the day in it.\r\n\r\n    AD CALVUM LICINIUM, ORATOREM.\r\n\r\n    Now if I loved you less, my friend,\r\n    Facetious Calvus, than these eyes,\r\n    You merit hatred in such wise\r\n    As men Vatinius hate. To send\r\n    Such stuff to me! Have I been rash\r\n    In word or deed? The gods forfend!\r\n    That you should kill me with such trash,\r\n    Of vile and deleterious verse--\r\n    Volumes on volumes without end,\r\n    Of ignominious poets, worse\r\n    Than their own works. May gods be pliant,\r\n    And grant me this: that poison--pest\r\n    Light on 'em all, and on that client\r\n    Who sent 'em you; and you in jest\r\n    Transfer them, odious, and mephitic,\r\n    And execrable. I suspect 'em\r\n    Sent you by that grammarian critic,\r\n    Sulla. If so, and you have lost\r\n    No precious labour to collect 'em,\r\n    'Tis well indeed; and little cost\r\n    To you, with malice aforethought,\r\n    To send (and with intent to kill him,\r\n    And on this blessed day, when nought\r\n    But Saturnalian joys should fill him)\r\n    Your friend Catullus such a set\r\n    Of murderous authors; but the debt\r\n    I'll pay, be even with you yet--\r\n    For no perfidious friend I spare.\r\n    At early dawn, ere the sun shine, I\r\n    Will rise, and ransack shop and stall,\r\n    Collect your Caesii and Aquini,\r\n    And that Suffenus: and with care\r\n    And diligence, will have all sent\r\n    To you, for a like punishment.\r\n    Hence, poets! with your jingling chimes:\r\n    Hence, miserables! halt and lame;\r\n    Be off, ye troublers of our times!\r\n    I send you packing whence ye came.\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--Kicking about the volumes, doubtless, as the \"Friend of\r\nHumanity\" did the \"Needy Knife-grinder.\"\r\n\r\nCURATE.--I did not translate that--for I thought the authors might\r\neasily have been burned for writing bad verses (no hint to you,\r\nAquilius; nothing personal); and that Calvus Licinius, having that\r\nremedy, need not have written about them. And I confess I don't see much\r\nin what he has written. This Suffenus, however, was no fool, but a man\r\nof wit and sense.\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--Yes,--and Catullus writes to Varrus specially about him. I\r\nhave translated that too. Here it is:--\r\n\r\n    AD VARRUM.\r\n\r\n    This man Suffenus, whom you know,\r\n    Varrus, is not without some show\r\n    Of parts, and gift of speech befitting\r\n    A man of sense. Yet he mistakes\r\n    His talents wondrously, and makes\r\n    His thousand verses at a sitting.\r\n    And troth, he makes them _look_ their best:\r\n    For, not content with palimpsest,\r\n    He has them writ on royal vellum,\r\n    Emboss'd and gilded, rubb'd and polish'd:\r\n    But read 'em, and you wish abolish'd\r\n    The privilege to make or sell 'em.\r\n    You read them, and the man is quite\r\n    Another man: no more polite--\r\n    No more \"the man about the town,\"\r\n    But metamorphosed to a clown--\r\n    Milker of goats, a hedger, digger,\r\n    So thoroughly is changed his figure,\r\n    So quite unlike himself. 'Tis odd,\r\n    Most strange, the man for wit so noted,\r\n    Whose repartees so much were quoted,\r\n    Is changed into a very clod!\r\n    And stranger still--he never seems\r\n    Quite to himself to be himself,\r\n    As when of poetry he dreams,\r\n    And writes and writes, and fills his reams\r\n    With poems destined for the shelf.\r\n    We are deceived--in this twin-brothers\r\n    All. There's one vanity between us,\r\n    And our self-knowledge stands to screen us\r\n    From our true portraits. Knowing others,\r\n    We ticket each man with his vice;\r\n    And find, most accurately nice,\r\n    In all a something of Suffenus.\r\n    Thus every man one knowledge lacks;\r\n    Our error is--we read the score\r\n    Of each man as he walks before,\r\n    And bear our tickets at our backs.\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--True, indeed--as old fables mostly are. There is in them the\r\ndepth of wisdom acquired by experience.\r\n\r\nCURATE.--I fear experience alone won't do much. It seems thrown away\r\nupon most people. They continue follies to the end. I suppose Cicero\r\nthought himself a poet; though it may be doubted if he wrote the line as\r\nJuvenal gives it,\r\n\r\n    \"O fortunatam natam me consule Romam.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps most men's natural common sense has a less wide range than they\r\nthink. For there are some things obvious to all besides, that the wisest\r\ncannot see.\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--Cicero was less likely to see any defect in himself than most\r\nmen. He had consummate vanity--which must have led him into many a\r\nridiculous position. But there were no Boswells in those days. I never\r\ncould understand how it is that so great an admiration of Cicero has\r\ncome over mankind. Even in language he has had an evil influence; and\r\nour literature for a long period was tainted with it. Sensible himself,\r\nhe taught the art of writing fluently without sense. The flow and\r\nperiod--the _esse videatur_--a style too common with us less than half a\r\ncentury ago--you might read page after page, and pause to wonder what\r\nyou had been reading about. The upper current of the book did not\r\ndisturb the under current of your own thoughts, perhaps aided by the\r\nlulling music.\r\n\r\nCURATE.--The vanity of Cicero was too manifest. It is a pity, for the\r\nsake of his reputation, that the letter to his friend, in which he\r\nrequested him to write his life, is extant. To tell him plainly that it\r\nis the duty of a friend to exaggerate his virtues, is a mean\r\nvanity--unworthy such a man.\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--Come, come! let him rest; our business is with Catullus.\r\nCurate, let us have your translation.\r\n\r\nCURATE.--I pass by the account of Suffenus, as well as some other\r\npieces, and come to that very short one in which he complains of the\r\nmortgage which is on his villa. It is a wretched pun on the word\r\n\"opponere,\" and was scarcely worth translating;--take it, however:\r\n\r\n    AD FURIUM.\r\n\r\n    You, Furius, ask against what wind\r\n      My little villa stands--\r\n    If Auster, or Favonius kind\r\n      Who comes o'er western lands,\r\n    Or cruel Boreas, or that one\r\n    That rises with the morning sun?\r\n\r\n    Alas--it stands against a breeze\r\n      Which beats against the door,\r\n    Of fifteen thousand sesterces,\r\n      And twice a hundred more.\r\n    I challenge you on earth to find\r\n    So foul and pestilent a wind.\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--What! do you look for a wind _on_ earth,--it blows over it;\r\nand catch it who can.\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--It blows every where. The worst I know is that which blows\r\ndown the chimney. And that reminds me to tell you what a town-bred\r\nchimney-sweeper said, the other day, to a friend of mine, in the valley\r\nyonder, who wanted to have a smoky chimney cured. My friend inquired if\r\nhe could teach it not to smoke. \"How can I tell?\" said he, \"I must take\r\nout a brick first and look into his _intellects_.\"\r\n\r\nCURATE.--Not the march--but the sweep of intellect spoke there.\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--And spoke not amiss; it was merely to see if he _had a mind_\r\nto be cured.\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--Perhaps you have translated that sweep's language better than\r\nyour passages from Catullus.\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--I did not attempt to translate that little piece,--but ran\r\nquite out of course, as the Curate would tell me, in a long paraphrase.\r\nThe idea is, however, furnished by Catullus,--so I dedicate it\r\n\r\n    AD FURIUM.\r\n\r\n    You ask me if my villa lies\r\n      Exposed to north, east, west, or south:\r\n    I answer,--every wind that flies,\r\n      Flies at it, and with open mouth.\r\n\r\n    From every quarter winds assail,\r\n      But that which comes from _quarter_-day,\r\n    Though it four times a-year prevail,\r\n      It does but whistle, and not pay.\r\n\r\n    Some blow from far, and some hard by;\r\n      One, mortgage-wind, takes shortest journey,\r\n    Only across the way from Sly,\r\n      And blasts with \"power of attorney.\"\r\n\r\n    But what is worse than windy racks is,\r\n      My windows leak at every pane,\r\n    And are not tight 'gainst rates and taxes.\r\n      My roof and doors _let_ in the rain--\r\n\r\n    The only _let_ my villa knows.\r\n      So that with taxes, wind, and wet,\r\n    From whatsoever point it blows,\r\n      My house is blown upon _unlet_.\r\n\r\nNow, I hope my friend the Curate will admit so far to be rather a\r\nlengthy translation. I say nothing of addenda--thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Winds blow, and crack your cheeks,\"--alack,\r\n      Who said it, wanted house and halls,\r\n    Nor knew winds have no cheeks to crack,\r\n      In short crack nothing but my walls.\r\n\r\n    My friends console--\"the winds will drop:\"\r\n      'Tis equal trouble to my mind;\r\n    For if it tumbles on the top,\r\n      You know I cannot _raise the wind_.\r\n\r\n    To sum up all--for its location;--\r\n      The question's of importance vital;--\r\n    In Chancery--wretched situation;\r\n      A rascal there disputes my title.\r\n\r\nCURATE.--You are coming it pretty strong, and quite blowing up Catullus\r\nwith your hurricane of winds. After all the household miseries in your\r\nlines, a cheering glass may set things to rights a little. Here, then,\r\nis what he says to his wine-server:--\r\n\r\n    AD PUERUM.\r\n\r\n    Boy, that at my drinking-bout\r\n    Servest old Falernian out,\r\n    Fill me faster cups, and quicker,\r\n    With the spirit-stirring liquor.\r\n    So Posthumia's law doth say,--\r\n    Mistress of the feast to-day;\r\n    She more vinous than the grape.\r\n    Springs of water--bane of wine--\r\n    Where ye please for me and mine,\r\n    Avaunt, begone, escape!\r\n    Emigrate to men demure.\r\n    My bumper is Thyonian pure.\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--I am afraid, Curate, that if you were to take what you please\r\nto call \"the cheering glass,\" such as the jade Posthumia would\r\nrecommend, we should have to put you to bed pretty early. It was the\r\ncustom, it should seem, of the ancients to make a throw of the dice to\r\ndetermine the arbiter of the feast--to appoint the drinking. Who threw\r\n_Venus_ (three sixes) was the _magister_; but the _magistra_ is a\r\nnovelty; a \"Venus Ebria,\" whose drinking law would throw all; for \"wine\r\nis a wrestler, and a shrewd one too.\" Doesn't Shakspeare say so? Now for\r\nyour version, Aquilius.\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--Curate will say, I am not so close to the original. But, on\r\nsuch a subject, we may be allowed to walk not quite straight;--a little\r\nzig-zaggy. Spite the coming criticism I venture:--\r\n\r\n    AD PUERUM SUUM,\r\n\r\n    (To his Wine-server.)\r\n\r\n    Pour me out, boy, the generous juice.\r\n      The racy, true, the old Falernus;\r\n    Such wines as, to Posthumia's thinking,\r\n      Are only fit for mortals' use;\r\n    When in her glory, drunk, and winking,\r\n    The dame would quaff, and wisely learn us\r\n      The good old simple law of drinking.\r\n\r\n    But water shun;--Hence, waters! go,\r\n      E'en as ye will, to chill Avernus,\r\n    Or whereso'er ye please to flow;--\r\n    Be drink for all the dull, the slow,\r\n    The sad, the serious, the phlegmatic;\r\n    But leave this juice, this pure stomachic,\r\n      Its own, its unadulterate glow;--\r\n    This--this alone is genuine Bacchic!\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--Well, then, that must be our parting cup for the night, and a\r\npretty good \"_night-cap_\" it is. I was afraid, Aquilius, when you came\r\nto the \"phlegmatic\" you would rhyme it to \"rheumatic,\" and so on to the\r\n\"water-cure.\" You know that is recommended in rheumatic cases; but\r\nperhaps you don't know that I tried it. I had the water-drinking, the\r\nwet sheets, and all the rest of it.\r\n\r\nAQUILIUS.--And are here to tell of it!\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--Yes, and return to the old _tap_, (tapping his thigh and leg\r\npretty smartly;) and I suppose I must _stick_ to it.\r\n\r\nCURATE.--A medical friend told me the other day of a discussion upon\r\nthis subject, which I thought very amusing, as he narrated it remarkably\r\nwell, imitating the tones and dialect (Somersetshire) of at least one of\r\nthe speakers. He had some years before attended an old man in the\r\ncountry--a farmer well to do in the world--a man of very strong natural\r\nunderstanding, but entirely uneducated. He had lost sight of him for\r\nsome years, when, not long since, he was sent for to the old farm-house.\r\nInstead of the old stone floor, there was a carpet laid down, and an air\r\nof smartness over every thing, which he had never seen before. It turned\r\nout, that the old man's daughter had married: a smartish man, the\r\nhusband, was in the room, and to show his general knowledge of things,\r\nand acquaintance with the world, he advocated the water-cure, and\r\nquestioned my medical friend as to his opinion. A voice from the\r\nchimney-corner (the settle in it) cried out, \"It ain't na'tral.\" My\r\nfriend had not before seen the old man, he was so retired into the\r\nrecess. After having given his opinion to the bridegroom, he turned to\r\nhis old acquaintance, and said \"You remarked that it is not natural.\r\nWhat do you mean by _natural?_\" \"Why,\" replied the old man, \"I do think,\r\nmost dumb critturs knows what's good for 'em; and when a dog's sick\r\ndoesn't he eat grass? If a sheep's ill, don't he lick chalk or salt if\r\nhe can get it? And if a beast's ill,\" (I forget what he said was the\r\ncure for a beast);--\"but did you ever see any of them go and lie down in\r\nthe water, or fill themselves wi' it? There's plenty of it in ditches,\r\nand every where else, too, hereabouts. No, you never did.\" Then, looking\r\nup in the face of his orator son-in-law, he added, \"And you don't know\r\nwhy you never see'd it, nor why they don't do it. No, I know you don't.\r\nVy, I do--because they ha' got more zense.\" This was said with a kind of\r\ncontempt which was quite a floorer to the new wiseacre.\r\n\r\nGRATIAN.--Thanks for the story! now that is just the sense that I have\r\nacquired at some cost, and no cure; but I didn't get at it naturally as\r\nyour old friend did. So now for sleep, and good-night.\r\n\r\nThe Curate and I did not part so soon. Time flew, and we seemed to\r\nshorten the night--\"noctem vario sermone,\" as sayeth Virgil of poor\r\nDido, who must have found the conversation considerably flag with the\r\nstupid AEneas.\r\n\r\n\"Noctem vario sermone _trahebat_--it was a sad _drag_. It must have\r\nbecome very tiresome, a little while before that, when ill-mannered\r\nBitias drank up all the wine, and buried his face in the cup, \"pleno se\r\nproluit auro.\" And they had been obliged to resort to singing, always\r\nthe refuge from the visible awkwardness of _nothing to say_. And here I\r\ncannot but remark, Eusebius, what dull things their songs must have been\r\non natural philosophy, sun, moon, and stars--songs, Virgil tells you,\r\nedited by the old Astronomer-general Atlas. But as this was before the\r\nfoundation of Rome, they had not that variety for their selection,\r\nwhich was as much in fashion afterwards in Rome as Moore's Melodies in\r\nEngland, as we learn from Mr Macaulay, and his version and edition of\r\nthe \"Lays.\" They had no piccolo pianofortes in those days, or they would\r\nhave had something lighter than the Lays, as the better after-supper\r\nPoet calls it--a\r\n\r\n    \"Something more exquisite still.\"\r\n\r\nBut I am apparently, Eusebius, leaving the Curate to sleep or to\r\nmeditate upon his own unhappy condition while I thus turn the current of\r\nmy talk upon you. Unhappy condition, did I say? He seems to bear it\r\nwonderfully lightly; and once or twice, when the subject has been\r\nmentioned, indulged in an irreverend laugh. Now, I know you will ask how\r\na laugh can be irreverend. Don't you know the world well enough,\r\nEusebius, to know, that before a very great number of men, women, and\r\nchildren, a curate must not laugh, dare not laugh--blessed indeed, and\r\ndivested of the wretched rags of humanity, if he _cannot_ laugh. None\r\nbut a Bishop, or a Dean, who, in the eyes of the many, is a kind of\r\nextra-parochial nonentity, can really, in these times of severe\r\nreprobation for trifling peccadillos, afford to laugh; and they had\r\nbetter do it in private, and with aprons off--never before the Chapter,\r\nwho all, themselves, laugh in private. Man, you know, is the only\r\nrisible creature; but a Curate must begin to know, from the moment he\r\nhas put on his surplice, that he is to discard at once, and for ever,\r\nthis human and irreverend instinct. Had you lived in the triumphal days\r\nof the Puritans, what penalties would you not have had to undergo, what\r\nbuffetings and duckings, ere you could finally have overcome your strong\r\nnatural wicked propensity, and have sobered down, and riveted in iron\r\ngravity and moroseness those flexible, those mockingly flexible features\r\nof yours. As it is, in these days of \"revival,\" you only meet with\r\nconsiderable contempt, and evil opinion, which, as it comes rather late\r\nupon you, comes as an amusing novelty and additional provocative. But\r\nyou may be sure what you can afford to do, the Curate cannot. For the\r\npresent, therefore, let his few indulgences that way be a secret. He\r\nwill mend in time. For so it happens, that though the longer we live the\r\nmore we have to laugh at, we lose considerably our power of laughing.\r\nAnd that--between ourselves be it said, Eusebius--is, I think, a strong\r\nproof of our deterioration. A man, to laugh well, must be an honest\r\nman--mind, I say _laugh_: when Shakspeare says\r\n\r\n                \"A man may smile and smile,\r\n    And be a villain,\"\r\n\r\nhe purposely says _smile_, in contradistinction to laugh. He cannot\r\nlaugh and be a villain. A man cannot plot and laugh. A man may be much\r\nless innocent even when he thinks himself devout, than in his hour of\r\nmerriment, when he assuredly has no guile; but a man may even pray with\r\na selfish and a narrow mind, and his very prayers partake of his\r\niniquity: no bad argument for a prescribed form. A man that laughs well\r\nis your half-made friend, Eusebius, from the moment you hear him. It is\r\nbetter to trust the ear than the eye in this matter--such a man is a man\r\nafter your own heart. _After your own heart_, did I say, Eusebius? Words\r\nare the _ignes fatui_ to thoughts, and lead to strange vagaries--of\r\nwhich you have here a specimen; but these few words remind me to tell\r\nyou an anecdote, in this lull of the _Horae Catullianae_, which I would on\r\nno account keep from you. And you will see at once in it a large history\r\nin the epitome and the very pith of a fable--such as AEsop's. But I\r\nassure you it is no fable, but the simple plain truth; and I will vouch\r\nfor it, for I had it from the month of our friend S., the truest,\r\nhonestest of men, who saw with his own eyes, and heard with his own\r\nears, the persons and the sayings. S. was travelling some time ago,\r\nbeyond the directions of railroads, in a coach. There were two\r\ncompanions--preachers as he found, self-dubb'd Reverends of some\r\ndenomination or other, besides that reverend one of their own. Their\r\nconversation, as is usual with them, was professional, and they spoke of\r\ntheir brethren. In speaking of different preachers, one was mentioned,\r\nof whom one of the speakers said emphatically--\"Now that's what I call\r\na really good man--that's _a man after my own heart_--a man quite after\r\nmy own heart!\" The other said with rather doubtful and hesitating\r\nconfirmation, \"Ye-s.\" \"You don't seem to think so highly of him as I\r\ndo,\" said the first speaker. \"Why,\" replied the doubter, \"I can't say I\r\ndo; you remember some time ago he _failed_, and certainly upon that\r\noccasion he behaved _very ill_ to, not to say _cheated_, his creditors.\"\r\n\"Ah!\" said the first commendator again, \"that is very likely--I should\r\nhave expected _that_ of him.\"--Henceforth, Eusebius, whenever I hear\r\nsuch a commendation, I shall look out for a map of the gentleman's heart\r\nwho ventures upon this mode of expressing his admiration. Oh! what a\r\nworld we live in! This is a fact which would have been immortal, because\r\ntrue and from nature, in the hands of Le Sage; and is worthy of a place\r\nin a page of a modern \"Gil Blas.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so all this digression has arisen from a laugh of the Curate's, to\r\nwhom it is time to turn; or you will think we have been but bad company\r\nto each other. I will, however, end this passage with the remark, that a\r\nman may do a worse thing than laugh, and happy is he that can do a\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe Curate and I, then, for the rest of the night conversed upon the\r\naffair of his, which so unaccountably was making no little stir in the\r\nplace. The Curate told me, he was quite sure that his movements had been\r\nwatched; for that only yesterday, as he was entering the gate of his\r\nfriends, the family at Ashford, he saw Miffins's boy not far behind him\r\non a poney; and he thinks he came out for the purpose of watching him,\r\nfor he had scarcely reached the door, when he saw the lad ride hastily\r\nback. The Curate likewise confessed to me, that he did entertain some\r\ntender sentiments towards one of the inmates, Miss Lydia ----, that the\r\nfamily had lived much abroad, and that they had a French lady's-maid,\r\nwhom on one or two occasions he had certainly seen in this township. You\r\nsee the thread, Eusebius, which will draw out innumerable proofs for\r\nsuch a mind as Miffins's. Taking a paper out of his pocket, he said it\r\nwas put into his hands as he was coming away, and he had not opened it.\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said he, \"it may throw some light on the affair, as it was\r\ngiven me by one who is, I know, on the all-important committee.\" He\r\nbroke the seal, read, laughed immoderately for five minutes, and put it\r\ninto my hands:--\r\n\r\n\"REV. SIR,--Wishing to do the handsome to you, and straightforward and\r\ndownright honest part, the committee inform you that they have reported\r\nyour misconduct to the Lord Bishop, and I am desired accordingly to send\r\nyou a copy of their letter. By order of committee.--I am, sir,\r\n\r\n    \"JAMES JONES.\"\r\n\r\nEnclosed was the following, which these wiseacres had concocted--and I\r\nhave no doubt it was their pride in the composition, and in the\r\npenmanship, which induced them to send the copy to the Curate.\r\n\r\n\"TO MY LORD, YOUR LORDSHIP THE BISHOP.\r\n\r\n\"We the undersigned, the respectable inhabitants parishioners, approach\r\nmost dutifully our Bishop's worshipful Lordship. Hoping humbly that you\r\nwill be pleased to dismiss our curate, who, we are credibly informed,\r\nand particularly by three exemplary and virtuous ladies, they having\r\nbeen cautioned against him by one who knows him well, and is a friend\r\nlikewise to said ladies, and doing all the good kindness he can. We\r\nlearn with sorrow, that our curate has confessed to unbecomingly\r\nbehaviour, and that he has been seen even kissing. My Lord, our wives\r\nand daughters are not safe--we implore your Honour's Lordship to dismiss\r\nthe curate, and take them under your protection and keeping: We are\r\ninformed the curate has a foreign lady, not far from this, whom he\r\nalmost daily visits--and a Papist, which is an offence to your Lordship,\r\nand the glorious Protestant cause, to which we are uniformly and\r\nrespectfully attached, and to your worshipful Lordship very devoted--\"\r\nhere follow the names, headed by Matthew Miffins.\r\n\r\n\"And what steps do you intend to take?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"None whatever,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Let it wear itself out. I won't lengthen the existence of this scandal\r\nby the smallest patronage. I will not take it up, so it will die.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Bishop?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Is a man of sense,\" he replied, \"and good feeling; so all is safe, in\r\nhis hands.\"\r\n\r\nWe parted for the night.\r\n\r\nThe Curate called rather early the following morning, and we thought to\r\nhave an hour over Catullus, and went to seek our host Gratian. We found\r\nhim in his library in consultation with his factotum Jahn. He was\r\neloquent on the salting, and not burning his weeds, on Dutch\r\nclover--\"and mind, Jahn,\" said he, \"every orchard should have a\r\npig-stye: where pigs are kept, there apple-trees will thrive well, and\r\nbear well, if there be any fruit going:\" and he moved his stick on the\r\nfloor from habit, as if he were rubbing his pigs' backs; and then\r\nturning to us he said,--\"Why, Jahn has been telling me strange things:\r\nPrateapace and Gadabout have gone over to the chapel--left the church;\r\nnot there last Sunday. But I saw that Brazenstare there, trying, as she\r\nsat just before you, to put you, Mr Curate, out of countenance. Well,\r\nJahn tells me that the Reverend the Cow-doctor preached last evening a\r\nstirring sermon on the occasion, and was very hot upon the impurities\r\nand idolatries of the 'Establishment.' And Jahn tells me they don't\r\nspeak quite so well of me as they should; for when he plainly told\r\nMiffins in his own shop, that he was sure his master would not\r\ncountenance any thing wrong, the impudent fellow only said, 'May be not;\r\nbut he and his master might not be of the same opinion as to what _is_\r\nwrong.' The rogue! I should like to have put all his weights in the\r\ninspector's scales.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" quoth Jahn, \"but I am 'most ashamed to tell your honour what Tom\r\nPotts, the exciseman, said, who happened to be present.\"\r\n\r\n\"Out with it, by all means, Jahn,\" said our friend.\r\n\r\n\"Well then, sir, as true as you are there, he said that your honour was\r\na very kind gentleman, and your word was worth any other ten men's in\r\nmost things; but where it might be to get a friend out of trouble, and,\r\nfor aught he knew, foe either, why then, he thought your honour might\r\nfib a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" said Gratian, \"he didn't say quite that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" quoth Jahn, \"quite that, and more; something remarkable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remarkable!\" said I,--\"what could that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, something I shan't forget; and I don't think it was religious and\r\nproper,\" said Jahn; and lowering his voice, and addressing me and the\r\nCurate rather than his master, he added,--\"He thought his honour had a\r\nkind heart, too kind; for that if Belzebub should come of a wet and dark\r\nnight, and knock at his honour's door, and just say in a humble voice\r\nthat he was weary and foot-sore, that his honour would be sure to take\r\nhim in, give him a bed, and a stiff tumbler of brandy and water, and\r\nsend for the farrier in the morning to fresh shoe him unknowingly; for\r\nhe would make him stoop, put his claws on the ground, and throw a\r\nblanket over him, and make the farrier believe that, out of a whim, he\r\nwas only a shoeing a great big goat.\"\r\n\r\nGratian laughed at the whimsical idea of the exciseman, called him a\r\ntrue and good spirit-gauger; then giving some sharp taps to his hip, his\r\nknee, and his legs with his stick, rose from his seat, and said, \"Come,\r\nCurate, you and I must take a walk amongst these people, and see what we\r\ncan do: it is most time to put a stop to this mischievous absurdity,\r\nand, I fear me, of our own making.\"\r\n\r\nAway they went, and I put up my remaining translations from Catullus,\r\ntook down a book, read awhile, and then meditated this letter to you.\r\nAnd now, my dear Eusebius, when you publish it in Maga, as you did my\r\nlast, folk will say--\"Why, what is all this about? _Horae Catullianae!_ It\r\nis no such thing.\" Be it, then, I say, what you will. Do you think I am\r\nwriting an essay?--no, a letter; and I may, if I please, entitle it, as\r\nMontaigne did--\"On coach horses,\" and still make it what I please. It\r\nshall be a novel, if they please, for that is what they look for now: so\r\nlet the Curate be the hero,--and the heroine--but must it be a love\r\nstory? Then I won't forestall the interest, so wait to the end; and in\r\nmy next, Eusebius, we will repeat Catullus for the play, and say with\r\nthe announcing actor, \"to conclude with an after-piece which will be\r\nexpressed in the bills.\"\r\n\r\n    My dear Eusebius, ever yours,\r\n\r\n    AQUILIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSONS FROM THE FAMINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two great parties into which the country was divided on the subject\r\nof our commercial relations with foreign states, maintained principles\r\ndiametrically opposite on the effects to be anticipated from the\r\nadoption of their respective systems. The Free-Traders constantly\r\nalleged, that the great thing was to increase our _importations_; and\r\nthat, provided this was done, government need not disquiet themselves\r\nabout our _exportations_. Individuals, it was said, equally with\r\nnations, do not give their goods for nothing: if foreign produce of some\r\nsort comes in, British produce of some sort must go out. Both parties\r\nwill gain by the exchange. The inhabitants of this country will devote\r\ntheir attention to those branches of industry in which we can undersell\r\nforeign nations, and they will devote their attention to those branches\r\nof industry in which they can undersell us. Neither party will waste\r\ntheir time, or their labour, upon vain attempts to raise produce for\r\nwhich nature has not given them the requisite facilities. Both will buy\r\ncheaper than they could have done if an artificial system of protection\r\nhad forced the national industry into a channel which nature did not\r\nintend, and experience does not sanction. We may be fed by the world,\r\nbut we will clothe the world. The abstraction of the precious metals is\r\nnot to be dreaded under such a system, for how are the precious metals\r\ngot but in exchange for manufactures? Their existence in this country\r\npresupposes the exit of a proportionate amount of the produce of British\r\nindustry. Nobody gives dollars, any more than corn, for nothing. Our\r\nfarmers must take to dairy and pasture cultivation to a greater extent\r\nthan heretofore. A certain number of agricultural labourers, may, it is\r\ntrue, be thrown out of employment by the displacing of rural industry in\r\nmaking the transition from the one species of country labour to the\r\nother; but the evil will only be temporary, and they will speedily be\r\nabsorbed in the vast extension of our manufacturing industry. High\r\nprices need never be feared under such a system: a bad season is never\r\nuniversal over the world at the same time; and free-trade will\r\npermanently let in the superfluity of those countries where food is\r\nabundant, to supply the deficiencies of those in which, from native\r\nsources, it is scanty.\r\n\r\nThe Protectionists reasoned after an entirely different manner. The\r\ndoctrines of free-trade, they observed, perfectly just in their\r\napplication to different provinces of the same empire, are entirely\r\nmisplaced if extended to different _countries_ of the world, the more\r\nespecially if placed in similar, or nearly similar, circumstances. The\r\nstate of smothered or open hostility in which they are in general placed\r\nto each other, if their interests are at all at variance; the necessity\r\nof sheltering infant manufacturing industry from the dangerous\r\ncompetition of more advanced civilisation, or protecting old-established\r\nagricultural industry from the ruinous inroad of rude produce from\r\npoorer states, in which it is raised cheaper because money is less\r\nplentiful, render it indispensable that protection should exist on both\r\nsides. If it does not, the inevitable result will be, that the\r\ncultivators of the young state will destroy the agriculture of the old\r\none, and the manufacturers of the old one extinguish the fabrics of the\r\nyoung. This effect is necessary, and, to all appearance, will ever\r\ncontinue; for the experience of every age has demonstrated that, so\r\ngreat is the effect of capital and civilisation applied to manufactures,\r\nand so inconsiderable, comparatively speaking, their influence upon\r\nagriculture, that the old state can always undersell the new one in the\r\nindustry of towns, and the new one undersell the old one in the industry\r\nof the country. The proof of this is decisive. England, by the aid of\r\nthe steam-engine, can undersell the inhabitants of Hindostan in the\r\nmanufacture of muslins from cotton growing on the banks of the Ganges;\r\nbut with all the advantages of chemical manure and tile draining, it is\r\nundersold in the supply of food by the cultivators on the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThis being a fixed law of nature, evidently intended to check the growth\r\nof old states, and promote the extension of mankind in the uncultivated\r\nparts of the earth, it is in vain to contend against it. So violently\r\ndoes free-trade displace industry on both sides, where it is fully\r\nestablished, that it is scarcely possible to conceive that two nations\r\nshould at the same time run into the same glaring mistake; and thence\r\nthe common complaint that no benefit is gained, but an infinite loss\r\nsustained, by its establishment in any one country, and that reciprocity\r\nis on one side only. As no adequate exchange of manufactures for\r\nsubsistence is thus to be looked for, there must arise, in the old\r\nstate, a constant exportation of the precious metals, attended by\r\nfrequent commercial crises, and a constant increase in the weight of\r\ndirect taxation. Should it prove otherwise, and two nations both go into\r\nthe same system, it could lead to no other result but the stoppage of\r\nthe growth of civilisation in the young one, and the destruction of\r\nnational independence in the old. The former would never succeed in\r\nestablishing commerce or manufactures, from the competition of the\r\nsteam-engine in its aged neighbour; the latter would become dependent\r\nfor subsistence on the plough of the young one. The rising agricultural\r\nstate would be chained for ever to the condition of the serfs in Poland,\r\nor the boors in America; the stationary commercial state would fall into\r\nthe degrading dependence of ancient Rome on the harvests of Egypt and\r\nLybia.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the calamitous issue of the last harvest, in a part\r\nof the empire, it might have been difficult to say, to which side the\r\nweight of reason preponderated in these opposite arguments; and probably\r\nthe people of the country would have continued permanently divided on\r\nthem, according as their private interests or wishes were wound up with\r\nthe buying and selling, or raising and producing classes in society. But\r\nan external calamity has intervened;--Providence has denied for a\r\nseason, to one of the fruits of the earth, its wonted increase. The\r\npotato-rot has appeared; and nearly the whole subsistence of the people\r\nin the south and west of Ireland, and in the western Highlands of\r\nScotland, has been destroyed. Between the failure in the potato crop,\r\nand the deficiency in that of oats, at least L15,000,000 worth of the\r\nwonted agricultural produce has disappeared in the British Islands. And\r\nthe appearances which we now see around us are solely and entirely to be\r\nascribed to that deficiency. No one need be told what these appearances\r\nare, or how deeply they have trenched upon the usual sources of\r\nprosperity in the empire: they have been told again and again, in\r\nparliament, at public meetings, and in the press, _usque ad nauseam_.\r\nGovernment has acted, if not judiciously, at least in the right spirit;\r\nits errors have been those of information, not of intention. The monster\r\nmeetings, the flagrant ingratitude, the broken promises of the Irish\r\nCatholics, have been forgotten. England, as a nation, has acted nobly;\r\nshe has overlooked her wrongs: she saw only her fellow-subjects in\r\ndistress. L10,000,000 sterling have been voted by parliament in a single\r\nyear for the relief of Irish suffering. Magnificent subscriptions, from\r\nthe throne downwards, have attested the sympathy of the British heart\r\nwith the tale of Irish and Highland suffering. But, notwithstanding all\r\nthese astonishing exertions, and notwithstanding the existence of an\r\nunprecedented demand for labour in most parts of the country, in\r\nconsequence of vast railway undertakings being on foot, on which at\r\nleast L30,000,000 a-year must be expended for three or four years to\r\ncome, distress is in many places most acute, in all severely felt. And\r\nwhat is very remarkable, and may be considered, as a distinctive sign of\r\nthe times, specially worthy of universal attention, the suffering has\r\nnow spread to those classes which are _furthest removed_ from the blight\r\nof nature, and fastened upon those interests which, according to the\r\ngenerally received opinion, should have been _benefited rather than\r\ninjured_ by the calamity which has occurred.\r\n\r\nThat some millions of cultivators in the southwest of Ireland, and some\r\nhundred thousand in the west Highlands of Scotland, should be involved,\r\nliterally speaking, in the horrors of famine, in consequence of the\r\nuniversal failure of the crop which constituted at once their sole\r\nobject of labour and only means of subsistence, may easily be\r\nunderstood. That this alarming failure should raise prices of every sort\r\nof food to the scarcity-level in every part of the empire, is equally\r\nintelligible; and that government, in conformity with the _universal_\r\nsense of the nation, should, in such an extremity, throw open the ports\r\nto all kinds of food, and thereby let in an unexampled amount of foreign\r\nproduce to supply the failure of that usually raised at home, is an\r\nequally intelligible consequence. It may not be considered surprising,\r\nthat starving multitudes should issue in all directions from the scene\r\nof wo in the Emerald Isle, to seek relief in the industry or charity of\r\nGreat Britain; and that all the great towns in the west of the island\r\nshould be overwhelmed with pauperism and typhus fever, in consequence of\r\ntheir being the first to be reached by the destructive flood; although\r\nit was hardly to be expected that a hundred and thirty-two thousand\r\napplications for relief were to be made to the parochial authorities of\r\nLiverpool in a _single week_; and that they returned thanks to Heaven\r\nwhen the influx of Irish paupers was reduced to _two thousand a-week_!\r\nBut the remarkable thing, and the thing which the commercial classes\r\ncertainly did not expect, is this:--_The calamity has now reached\r\nthemselves_, although the hand of Providence has only stricken the\r\nproducing agricultural classes. Trade never was lower, monied distress\r\nnever more severe, markets of all sorts never were more rapidly\r\nDECLINING, than during a period when IMPORTATIONS of all sorts have been\r\nMOST RAPIDLY INCREASING. Nearly all the manufactories in Lancashire and\r\nLanarkshire are put on short time; the public funds and stocks of all\r\nsorts are falling; the rate of bankers' advances in Scotland is raised\r\nto _six per cent_;[7] seven per cent is charged in Liverpool and Glasgow\r\non railway advances, and permanent loans are taken on railway debentures\r\nby the most experienced persons for three years at five per cent; the\r\nBank of England has raised its discounts; our exports are rapidly\r\ndeclining; and all at a time, when the importation of all sorts of rude\r\nproduce is on an unprecedented scale of magnitude, and the warehouses of\r\nLiverpool and Glasgow are literally _bursting_ with the prodigious mass\r\nof grain stored in them from all parts of the world!\r\n\r\nFortunately, statistical documents exist, derived from official sources,\r\nwhich demonstrate beyond the possibility of doubt the coexistence of\r\nthis _vast increase_ in the amount of subsistence imported, and _vast\r\ndiminution_ in the amount of manufactures raised or exported in all\r\nparts of the British empire. A paper has lately been presented to\r\nparliament, showing the amount of imports, exports, and shipping during\r\nthe year 1846, compared with 1845; from which this important and\r\nluminous fact is decisively established, how hard soever it may be to\r\ncomprehend on the part of a large and influential portion of our\r\npoliticians. From it it appears that the amount of subsistence imported\r\nin 1846 was six times greater than in 1845, although free-trade only\r\ncommenced in the middle of the former year. It had reached the\r\nunparalleled amount in the latter year, of grain or flour, equal to\r\n_five millions and a half quarters of grain_. The tonnage _inwards_ had\r\nturned five millions of tons; the custom-house duties, notwithstanding\r\nthe numerous reductions of duties on imported articles, had risen\r\nL700,000 above the preceding year, and still kept above L22.000,000\r\nsterling. Here, then, were all the sources and marks of prosperity, so\r\nfar as they depended on importations, in a state of unexampled vigour\r\nand efficiency. Was this attended, as we were constantly told it would\r\nbe, by a corresponding impulse given to our fabrics? Has the increased\r\nactivity of our manufacturing cities compensated for the sterility of so\r\nlarge a part of our fields? The fact is just the reverse. Though\r\nfree-trade has only been in operation for the last six months of 1846,\r\nthey were signalised by a universal _decline_ in all the principal\r\narticles of our exportation; and, by the unanimous voice of all\r\npractical men, trade, so far as exports or production is concerned,\r\nnever was in a more depressed state than when, so far as imports are\r\nconcerned, it had attained an unprecedented _extension_.\r\n\r\nNever was a truer observation than is made by the Free-Traders, when\r\nthey assert that goods will not be sent into a nation for nothing; and\r\nthat, if our imports increase, something that goes out must have\r\nreceived a proportional augmentation. They forget only one circumstance,\r\nwhich, however, is of some little consequence, namely, that two things\r\nmay go out, goods or SPECIE. We have melancholy proof, in the present\r\nstate of the money market, that the latter occurrence has taken place to\r\nan inconvenient and distressing extent, and that that is the direct\r\ncause of the extravagant rate of interest charged on bankers' advances,\r\nand the general scarcity of money felt throughout the country. That the\r\n_capital_ of the country is not only sufficient, but abundant, is\r\ndecisively proved by the fact that, notwithstanding the vast extent of\r\nthe railway and other undertakings of a public character going on both\r\nin Great Britain and Ireland, government has borrowed the loan of\r\nL8,000,000 for the relief of Ireland at L3, 7s. 6d. per cent. The three\r\nper cents are about 90, yielding about the same return for money. But is\r\n_currency_ equally abundant? So far from it, the bankers are charging\r\nsix, and the persons making advances on railway concerns seven per cent.\r\nThe holder of capital is glad if he can get three and a half per cent;\r\nbut the holder of currency will not let his notes or sovereigns out of\r\nhis hand for less than six or seven per cent. Can there be a more\r\nconvincing proof that the currency of the country has been unduly\r\ndrained away, and that the present monetary system, which forbids any\r\nextension of it in paper when the specie is abstracted, is based on a\r\nwrong foundation? Nor is it surprising that the currency should be\r\nstraitened when it is notorious that every packet which goes out to\r\nAmerica takes out vast sums to that continent to pay for the immense\r\nquantities of grain which are brought in. That drain only began to be\r\nfelt in a serious manner within the last two months, because the great\r\nshipments from America took place in November and December last, when\r\nthe failure of the potato crop in this country was fully ascertained;\r\nand consequently, the payments made in bills at three months, required\r\nto be made in February and March. And when it is recollected that the\r\nquantity of grain imported in seven months only--viz. from 5th July\r\n1846, to 5th February 1847--exceeded _six millions_ of quarters, at the\r\nvery time that all our exports were diminishing; it may be imagined how\r\nprodigious must have been the drain upon the metallic resources of the\r\ncountry to make up the balance.[8]\r\n\r\nSorely perplexed with results so diametrically opposite to all their\r\ndoctrines as to an increase of importation being necessarily attended\r\nwith a proportionate increase of exportation, and of all apprehension of\r\nan undue pressure thence arising on the money market being chimerical,\r\nthe Free-Traders lay it all upon the famine at home or abroad. The\r\npotato-rot, it is said, has _concealed_ the effects of free-trade:\r\ndistress in foreign nations has disabled them to purchase our\r\nmanufactures in return for their rude produce; the increase of British\r\nimportation has come too soon to operate as yet on their purchase of our\r\nmanufactures. Here again the facts come decisively to disprove the\r\ntheoretical anticipations. So far has the increase of our importations\r\nbeen from being sudden, and come last year for the first time on foreign\r\nnations, it has been _remarkably gradual_, and has gone on for years,\r\nhaving received only a great impulse in the articles on which the duty\r\nwas lessened or removed last summer. Our general imports have steadily\r\nadvanced for the last three years; and in particular articles the same\r\nprogress has been conspicuous.[9] How, then, has it happened that this\r\ngeneral, continued, and steady _increase_ of imports has issued only in\r\na _diminution_ to an alarming extent of exports? And observe, the\r\ncountries from which we have imported so largely last year of grain and\r\narticles of subsistence, have not only not suffered by the scarcity\r\ngeneral on the Continent, but have profited immensely by it. America has\r\nbeen blessed with a splendid crop of every species of grain; and, in\r\nconsequence of the famine in Ireland and severe scarcity in France,\r\nprices of grain have risen to triple their former amount in the United\r\nStates. It has risen so much in the southern states of Russia, that the\r\nEmperor of Russia has prohibited the farther exportation of it from the\r\nBlack Sea. But all these floods of wealth flowing into the great grain\r\nstates from the failure of the crops in France and Ireland, have been\r\nunavailing to produce any increased activity in our manufactures. On the\r\ncontrary, they are all declining; and our immense importations of food\r\nare almost all paid for in direct exportations of the precious metals.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the general depression of manufactures in all the chief seats\r\nof our fabrics is so serious, that it is evidently owing to a much more\r\ngeneral and stringent cause than the decline, considerable as it is, in\r\nour exports. It is not a decrease of two millions out of fifty-three\r\nmillions--in other words, of less than a _five-and-twentieth_\r\npart--which will explain the general putting of mills in Lancashire and\r\nLanarkshire on short time, the fall in the value of all kinds of stock\r\nand general decline in the vent for all kinds of manufactured produce.\r\nIt is in the _home markets_ that the real and blighting deficiency is\r\nexperienced. And what is the cause of this decline in the home market?\r\nThe Free-Traders are the first to tell us what has done it. It is the\r\nfamine in Ireland. The total manufactured produce of the island is\r\ncertainly not under L200,000,000[10] annually, of which somewhat above\r\nL51,000,000 is for the foreign markets of the world. What is a\r\ndeficiency of L2,000,000 in such a mass? If that had been the _only_\r\ndecline that had taken place, it would have been scarcely perceptible,\r\nand would have left no visible effects on our commercial activity or\r\ngeneral prosperity. It is clear that the great falling off must have\r\nbeen in the home market. Nor is it difficult to see how this has\r\nhappened. Fifteen millions' worth of agricultural produce has\r\ndisappeared; prices of wheat have risen in consequence to 80s.\r\na-quarter, and oats in a still higher proportion; and an alarming drain\r\nupon the metallic resources of the country taken place. It is this which\r\nhas paralysed the manufactures and depressed the commerce of the\r\ncountry. And when it is recollected that the home market now consumes\r\nlittle short of L150,000,000 a-year, it may easily be conceived what a\r\nserious check to industry a diminution to the amount of even an eighth\r\nor a tenth of the usual domestic purchases must occasion.\r\n\r\nThe Free-Traders say, that the famine in Ireland has _concealed_ the\r\neffects of the adoption of their system of policy; and that all the\r\ndistress and suffering which has ensued is to be ascribed to that cause.\r\nFrom the observations now made, however, it is apparent that the effect\r\nof the famine has been, not to conceal the effects of free-trade, but to\r\n_accelerate_ them. For what has the famine done? It has simply caused\r\nfifteen millions' worth of domestic agricultural produce to be exchanged\r\nfor fifteen millions' worth of foreign agricultural produce. The potato\r\ncrop, which has perished in Ireland, is estimated at fifteen millions'\r\nworth; and, supposing that statement is a little exaggerated, it is\r\nprobable that, taking into account the simultaneous failure in the crop\r\nof oats, both there and in Great Britain, the total amount of home\r\nagricultural produce that is deficient may amount to that value. _But\r\nforeign agricultural produce, to an equal or greater amount, has been\r\nimported._ Six millions of quarters, between grain of all sorts and\r\nflour, have been entered for home consumption in seven months preceding\r\n5th February 1847. Taking these quarters, on an average, as worth fifty\r\nshillings to the consumer--which is certainly no extravagant estimate,\r\nseeing wheat is up at seventy-nine shillings--we shall have, then, six\r\nmillions of quarters, worth fifteen millions sterling. The home\r\nagricultural produce that has failed is just equal in value to the\r\nforeign agricultural produce that has been imported. The distress that\r\nprevails, therefore, is not owing to any deficiency of food for man or\r\nanimals in the United Kingdom, for as much has come in, of foreign\r\nproduce, as has disappeared of domestic. It is entirely to be ascribed\r\nto the supplanting, _in the national subsistence, of a large part of\r\nhome produce by an equally large part of foreign produce_. And in the\r\nsocial, commercial, and national effects which we see around us, we may\r\ndiscern, as in a mirror, not merely the probable but certain effects of\r\nsuch a substitution if perpetuated to future times.\r\n\r\nThis view of the subject is of such vast importance that we deem it\r\nimpossible to impress it too strongly on our readers. We have been\r\nalways told that the great thing is to secure a great importation; that\r\nsuch a thing must necessarily lead to a corresponding increase of\r\nexportation;--that all apprehension about the imports being paid in\r\ngold, and not in manufactures, are chimerical;--that the sooner the\r\ninferior lands in the British islands go out of cultivation the\r\nbetter;--that ample food for the inhabitants will be obtained from\r\nforeign states; and that the agriculturists thrown out of employment by\r\nthe change will be rapidly absorbed, and more profitably employed in\r\nsustaining our extended manufactures. Well, the thing has been done,\r\nand the desired consummation has taken place, from an extraneous cause,\r\neven more rapidly than was anticipated. The Free-Traders contemplated\r\nthe substitution of foreign for British agricultural produce to the\r\nextent of fifteen or twenty millions as a most desirable result; but\r\nthey only lamented it could not be looked for for three or four years.\r\nIt would take that time to beat down the British farmer; to convince the\r\ncultivators of inferior lands of the folly of attempting a competition\r\nwith the great grain districts of the Continent. Providence has done the\r\nthing at once. We have got on at railway speed to the blessings of the\r\nnew system. Free-trade was to lead to the much-desired substitution of\r\nsix million quarters of home for six million quarters of foreign grain\r\nin three years. But the potato-rot has done it in one. The free-trade\r\nrot could not have done it nearly so expeditiously, but it would have\r\ndone it as effectually. It is a total mistake, therefore, to represent\r\nthe famine in Ireland and the West of Scotland, as an external calamity\r\nwhich has concealed the natural effects of free-trade. It has only\r\nbrought them to light at once.\r\n\r\nHad British agriculture, instead of being stricken with sterility by the\r\nhand of Providence, in the poorest and worst cultivated part of the two\r\nislands, been suffered gradually to waste away, under the effects of a\r\ngreat and increasing foreign importation in all parts of the empire, the\r\ndestruction of home produce would have been equally extensive, but it\r\nwould have been more general. It would have risen to as great an amount,\r\nbut it would not have been so painfully concentrated in particular\r\ndistricts. Hundreds would not have been dying of famine in Skibbereen;\r\nseed-corn would not have been awanting in Skye and Mull; cultivation\r\nwould not have been abandoned in Tipperary; but the cessation of\r\nagricultural produce over the whole empire would have been quite as\r\ngreat. Low prices would have done the business as effectually, though\r\nnot quite so speedily, as the pestilence which has smitten the\r\npotato-field. Whoever casts his eye on the table of prices given\r\nbelow[11] for twenty years in London and Dantzic, must at once see\r\nthat, under a free-trade system, as large an importation of foreign\r\nproduce, and as extensive a contraction of home, as has taken place this\r\nyear is to be permanently looked for. The exportation and return of the\r\nprecious metals, and contraction of credit now felt as so distressing,\r\nmay be expected to be permanent. Providence has given us a warning of\r\nthe effects of our policy, before they have become irreparable. We have\r\nonly to suppose the present state of commerce and manufactures lasting,\r\nand we have a clear vision of the blessings of free-trade.\r\n\r\nNor is there any difficulty in understanding how it happens that the\r\nsubstitution of a large portion of foreign, for an equal amount of\r\nhome-grown produce, occasions such disastrous effects, and in particular\r\nproves so injurious to the commercial classes, who in the first instance\r\ngenerally suppose they are to be benefited by the change. If two or\r\nthree millions of rural labourers in the poorest and worst cultivated\r\ndistricts of the island, are thrown out of employment, either by a\r\nfailure in the vegetable on which alone, in their rude state, they can\r\nemploy their labour, or by the gradual substitution of foreign for home\r\nproduce in the supply of food for the people, it is a poor compensation\r\nto them to say that an equal amount of foreign grain has been brought\r\ninto the commercial emporiums of the empire--that if they will leave\r\nSkibbereen or Skye, and come to Liverpool or Glasgow, they will find\r\nwarehouses amply stored with grain, which at the highest current prices\r\nthey will obtain to any extent they desire. The plain answer is, that\r\nthey are starving; that their employment as well as subsistence is gone;\r\nthat they have neither the means of transport, nor any money to buy\r\ngrain when they reach the neighbourhood of the bursting warehouses. But\r\nthen they will be absorbed in the great manufacturing districts, where\r\ntheir labour will be more profitable to themselves and others, than in\r\ntheir native wilds! Yes, there is a process of absorption goes on, on\r\nthe occurrence of such a crisis; but it is not the absorption of labour\r\nby capital, but of capital by pauperism. Floods of starving destitutes\r\ninundate every steam-boat, harbour, and road, on the route to the scene\r\nof wo; and while the interior of the warehouses in the great commercial\r\ncities are groaning beneath the weight of foreign grain, the streets in\r\ntheir vicinity are thronged by starving multitudes, who spread typhus\r\nfever wherever they go, and fall as a permanent burden on the poor-rates\r\nof the yet solvent portions of the community.\r\n\r\nAnd the effect of this importation of foreign grain, from whatever cause\r\nit arises, necessarily is to _prevent_ this absorption of rural\r\npauperism by manufacturing capital, to which the Free-traders so\r\nconfidently look for the adjustment of society after the change has been\r\nmade. The nations who supply us with grain _do not want our\r\nmanufactures_. They will not buy them. What they want, is our money.\r\nThey have not, and will not have, the artificial wants requisite for the\r\ngeneral purchase of manufactures for a century to come. Generations must\r\ngo to their graves during the transition from rustic content to\r\ncivilised wants. America has sent us some millions of quarters of grain\r\nthis year, but there _is no increase in her orders for our\r\nmanufactures_. On the contrary, they are diminishing. Even the Free\r\nTrade Journals now admit this; constrained by the evidence of their\r\nsenses to admit the entire failure of all their predictions.[12] The\r\nreason is evident. They want our money, and our money they will have;\r\nand if they find our manufactures are beginning to flow in, in enlarged\r\nquantities, in consequence of our purchase of their grain, they will\r\nsoon stop the influx by a tariff. This is what we did, when situated as\r\nthey are--it is what all mankind will, and must do, in similar\r\ncircumstances. It was distinctly perceived and foretold by the\r\nProtectionists that this effect would follow from free-trade, and that,\r\nunless something was done to enlarge the currency to meet it, a\r\ncommercial crisis would ensue. These words published a year ago might\r\npass for the history of the time in which we now live:--\"Under the\r\nproposed reduced duties during the next three years, and trifling duty\r\nafter that period on all sorts of grain, there can be no doubt that a\r\nvery great impulse will be given to the corn-trade. It being now\r\nascertained, by a comparison of the prices during the last twenty years,\r\nthat there is annually a difference of from twenty to thirty shillings\r\na-quarter between the price that wheat bears in the British islands and\r\nat the shores of the Baltic, while the cost of importation is only five\r\nor six shillings a-quarter, there can be no question that the opening of\r\nthe ports will occasion a very large importation of foreign grain. It\r\nmay reasonably be expected that, in the space of a few years, the\r\nquantity imported will amount to _four or five millions of quarters\r\nannually_, for which the price paid by the importers cannot be supposed\r\nto be less, on the most moderate calculation, than seven or eight\r\nmillions sterling. The experience of the year 1839 sufficiently tells us\r\nwhat will be the effect of such an importation of grain, paid for, as it\r\nmust be, for the most part in specie, upon _the general monetary\r\nconcerns and commercial prosperity of the empire_. It is well known that\r\nit was this condition of things which produced the commercial crisis in\r\nthis country, led to three years of unprecedented suffering in the\r\nmanufacturing districts, and, as is affirmed, destroyed property in the\r\nmanufacturing districts of Lancashire, to the amount of\r\nL40,000,000.\"[13]\r\n\r\nLastly, the famine has taught the empire an important lesson as to Irish\r\nRepeal. For many years past, that country has been convulsed, and the\r\nempire harassed by the loud and threatening demand for the Repeal of the\r\nUnion, and the incessant outcry that the Irish people are perfectly\r\nequal to the duties of self-government, and that all their distresses\r\nhave been owing to the oppression of the Saxon. The wind of adversity\r\nhas blown, and where are these menaces now? Had Providence punished them\r\nby granting their prayer--had England cut the rope, as Mr Roebuck said,\r\nand let them go, where would Ireland have been at this moment? Drifting\r\naway on the ocean of starvation. Let this teach them their dependence\r\nupon their neighbours, and let another fact open their eyes to what\r\nthose neighbours are. England has replied to the senseless clamour, the\r\ndisgraceful ingratitude, by voting ten millions sterling in a single\r\nyear to relieve the distresses which the heedlessness and indolence of\r\nthe Irish had brought upon themselves. We say advisedly, _brought upon\r\nthemselves_. For, mark-worthy circumstance! the destruction of the\r\npotato crop has been just as complete, and the food of the people has\r\nbeen just as entirely swept away in the West Highlands of Scotland, as\r\nin Ireland, but _there has been no grant of public money to Scotland_.\r\nThe cruel Anglo-Saxons have given IT ALL to the discontented, untaxed\r\nGael in the Emerald isle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed by William Blackwood & Sons, Edinburgh._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Viz. 5-1/2 per cent on all advances on cash or current accounts, and\r\n1/2 per cent commission on all sums overdrawn.\r\n\r\n[8] Table showing the quantity of grain, including flour and meal,\r\nentered for home consumption, from 5th July 1846, to 5th February 1847,\r\nfrom the _London Gazette_ official returns:--\r\n\r\nQuarters of grain (including flour and meal) entered for         qrs.\r\n  home consumption, in the months from 5th July to 5th\r\n  January as reported, 1st February,                        5,148,449\r\nQuantity duty paid in month ending 5th Feb.        539,418\r\n  Do. do. flour and meal, 427,036 cwts.            142,345\r\n                                                   _______    681,763\r\n                                                            _________\r\nQuantity duty paid up to 5th January,                       5,830,212\r\n\r\n   In bond, 5th February,                           68,939\r\n     Do. do. flour and meal, 318,240 cwts.         106,080\r\n                                                   _______    175,019\r\n                                                              _______\r\n   Quantity in qrs. of duty paid and presently in bond,}    6,005,231\r\n                 from month ending 5th July to 5th Feb.}    _________\r\n\r\n\r\n[9]\r\n                                       1844.          1845.           1846.\r\nImports,    total official value,    L75,441,555   L85,281,958\r\nSugar, cwts.       \"                   4,139,983     4,880,780    5,231,818\r\nTea, lbs.          \"                  41,369,351    44,195,321   46,728,208\r\nCoffee, lbs.       \"                  31,391,297    34,318,121   36,781,391\r\nButter, cwts.      \"                     180,965       240,118      255,130\r\nCheese, cwts.      \"                     212,286       258,246      327,490\r\nLive animals, No.  \"                       8,007        34,426      140,752\r\nBrandy,            \"                   1,033,650     1,058,777    1,515,954\r\nGeneva,            \"                      14,937        15,536       40,266\r\nRum,               \"                   2,198,870     2,469,485    2,683,515\r\n\r\n[10] In 1840, the total amount was estimated at L180,000,000, of which\r\nL47,000,000, at that period, was for exportation, and L133,000,000 for\r\nthe home market.

This is to be accounted for by two\r\nfacts--The first being that we have not imported, and paid for as much\r\nas we have consumed, since, conjointly with our importations, we have\r\nbeen steadily eating up former reserves, so that our stock of all\r\nkinds--coffee, sugar, rice, &c., are low; and, next, because we have\r\ndiminished our importations of raw material in a remarkable degree, and\r\nhence, while paying for provisions, have lessened our usual payments on\r\nthis score. Here, too, in like manner, _we have been drawing upon our\r\nreserves_. Our manufactures have been carried on with hemp, flax, and\r\ncotton, which had been paid for in former years, and we have left\r\nourselves at the present moment short of all these articles, the stock\r\nof the latter alone, on the 1st of January last, as compared with the\r\npreceding year, being 545,790 against 1,060,560 bales. We are not only\r\npoorer, therefore, by all the bullion we have lost, but by all the stock\r\nwe have thus consumed.\r\n\r\n\"This _process cannot go on any longer_. We have now no accumulations to\r\neat into, and must, consequently, _pay for what we use_. Concurrently,\r\ntherefore, with our importations of corn and other provisions, (which\r\nare now going on at a much greater rate, and at much higher prices than\r\nin 1846,) and just in proportion as they beget a demand for our\r\nmanufactures, we must have importations of raw material. Large purchases\r\nof hemp and flax are alleged to have been made in the north of Europe,\r\nfor spring shipment, and cotton from the United States is only delayed\r\nby the want of ships. Wool from Spain, and the Mediterranean, saltpetre,\r\noil-seeds, &c., from India, and a host of minor articles, have also been\r\nkept back by the same cause, and will pour in upon us to make up our\r\ndeficiencies directly any relaxation shall take place (if such could be\r\nforeseen) of the universal influx of grain. In this way, just as one\r\ncause of demand diminishes the other will increase, and the balance will\r\nbe kept up against us for a period to which at present it is impossible\r\nto fix a limit.\r\n\r\n\"_We thus see that no call that can possibly arise for our manufactures\r\ncan have the effect of preventing a continuous drain of bullion_. That a\r\nlarge trade will occur no one can doubt, but at present it is scarcely\r\neven in prospect. From India and China each account comes less\r\nfavourable than before; from Russia we are told that 'no great demand\r\ncan be expected for British goods under the present high duties' in that\r\ncountry; while even from the United States, the point from whence relief\r\nwill most rapidly come, we hear of a shrewd conviction that we are\r\napproaching _a period of low prices_, and that, consequently, for the\r\npresent 'the less they order from us the better.'\"--_Times_, March 10,\r\n1847.\r\n\r\n[13] _England in 1815 and 1845_, pp. v-vii.
