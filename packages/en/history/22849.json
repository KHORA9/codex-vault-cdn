He heard, or thought he heard, the voices of people and the\r\nsound of a trumpet: he noticed the recently cut notches, five feet\r\nasunder, on the bark of the trees, and he saw the smoke of fires. He\r\ninferred that they possessed some unusual method of climbing, or that\r\ntheir stature was gigantic. In the sound, the colonist recognises the\r\nvocal _cooey_ of the aborigines, and learns from the steps \"to the\r\n_birds' nests_,\" that they then hunted the opossum, and employed that\r\nmethod of ascent, which, for agility and daring has never been\r\nsurpassed. Thus, during more than 150 years, this country was forgotten;\r\nand such were the limits of European knowledge, when the expedition of\r\nCook was dispatched by Great Britain to explore this hemisphere. No\r\nnavigator brought larger views, and a temper more benevolent, to the\r\ntask of discovery. To some nations he opened the path of civilisation\r\nand religion: to this race he was the harbinger of death.\r\n\r\n[1773.] Furneaux, Captain Cook's second in command, first visited this\r\ncountry. He saw the fires of the natives, ten miles off. They had left\r\ntheir huts, formed but for a day, in which were fragments of fish,\r\nbaskets, and spears. The British deposited gun-flints, barrels, and\r\nnails, in payment for the relics they removed; and they left Adventure\r\nBay, concluding that a most miserable race of mortals inhabited a\r\ncountry capable of producing all the necessaries of life, \"and the\r\nfinest climate in the world.\"\r\n\r\nOne year before, Captain Marian, a Frenchman, according to the authors\r\nof his country, visited this island. The intercourse was hostile and\r\nleft traces of blood; and to this may be attributed the absence of the\r\nnatives when Furneaux appeared on the coast.\r\n\r\n[1777.] The descriptions of Cook are founded on his own observations,\r\nand are, on the whole, favorable to the natives. The English, while\r\nwooding and watering, were surprised by the visit of eight men and a\r\nboy. They were unarmed, except that one of them carried a stick, pointed\r\nat the end. They were of middling stature, slender, and naked. On\r\ndifferent parts of their bodies were ridges, both straight and curved,\r\nraised in the skin: the hair of the head and beard was smeared with red\r\nointment. They were indifferent to presents; they rejected bread, and\r\nthe flesh of the sea elephant, but accepted some birds, which they\r\nsignified their intention to eat. Cook prevailed on a native to throw\r\nthe stick at a mark thirty yards distant, but he failed after repeated\r\ntrial. The Otaheitian, Omai,[1] to exhibit his skill, fired off a\r\nmusket: at the report they fled, and so great was their fear, that they\r\ndropped the axe and knives they had received.\r\n\r\nA dead calm retarded the departure of the vessels next day, and the\r\nparties sent ashore, were accompanied by Cook. About twenty natives soon\r\njoined them: one, who was conspicuously deformed, amused them by the\r\ndrollery of his gestures, and the seeming humour of his speeches. Some,\r\nwore three or four folds round the neck, made of fur; and round the\r\nancles a slip of the skin of kangaroo. Captain Cook returned to the\r\nvessel, leaving Lieutenant King in charge: soon after, the women and\r\nchildren arrived: they were introduced by the men to the English. The\r\nchildren were thought pretty; of the beauty of the women the account was\r\nnot equally favorable. They rejected with disdain the presents and\r\nfreedoms of the officers, and were ordered by an elderly man to\r\nretire--a command, to which they submitted with reluctance.\r\n\r\nDr. Anderson, the surgeon of the _Resolution_, describes the natives as\r\na mild, cheerful race, with an appearance less wild than is common to\r\nsavages. He considered them devoid of activity, genius, and\r\nintelligence; their countenance, he delineates as plump and pleasing.\r\n\r\n[1792.] But though later on the spot, assisted by the remarks of\r\nprevious observers, Labillardiere, of all, was the most assiduous and\r\nexact. The naturalist of D'Entrecasteaux's expedition, he saw mankind\r\nwith the eye of a philosopher. He was pleased to examine the passions of\r\na race, least of all indebted to art; yet the prevailing notions of\r\nCitizen Frenchmen, perhaps, gave him a bias, when estimating an\r\nuncivilised people. He left Europe when the dreams of Rousseau were the\r\ntoys of the speculative, and before they became the phantoms of the\r\npopulace. His observations were, doubtlessly, correct; but his grouping\r\nis artistic, and not without illusion. In his work, the Tasmanian blacks\r\nappear in the most charming simplicity, harmless and content; an\r\nextraordinary remnant of primitive innocence. At first they fled from\r\nthe French: an old woman they chased, took a leap which, if credible,\r\nwas terrific; she dashed over a precipice forty feet high, and was lost\r\namong the rocks!\r\n\r\nLabillardiere having landed, with several companions, proceeded towards\r\na lake; hearing human voices, they followed the direction of the sound;\r\nthe sudden cry of the natives induced them to return for their arms.\r\nThen proceeding towards the woods, they met the tribe--the men and boys\r\nin a semicircle, with the women and children behind. Labillardiere\r\noffered a piece of biscuit, and held out his hand, which a savage chief\r\naccepted, and smiling drew back one foot, and bowed with admirable\r\ngrace. He gave to the French a necklace, which he called _cantaride_,\r\nformed of wilk shells, in exchange for articles of dress, a poll-axe,\r\nand knives.\r\n\r\nThe proportions are worth remarking: in a party of forty, there were\r\neight men and seven women; of forty-eight, there were ten men and\r\nfourteen women. Thus the females were most numerous, and the rising\r\ngeneration nearly one-third more than the adults. They were generally\r\nhealthy; one only suffered from cutaneous disease, one from a defect of\r\nvision, and several from slight wounds. It will be told, that a sad\r\nreverse was afterwards their fate. The French, supposing they subsisted\r\non fish, expected to find leprosy, and concluded, not that other food\r\nwas procured, but that the doctors were mistaken. The women and girls\r\nwere the fishers: they plunged amidst sea weed, and raised the shell\r\nfish from rocks by the spatula. They killed the cray fish before\r\nlanding. They could endure the water twice as long as Europeans. In the\r\nintervals of diving they roasted their spoil, and warmed themselves\r\nbetween two fires; sometimes feeding their children, or themselves. Thus\r\nthey continued alternately fishing and cooking, until all were\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nThe men seemed indolent; nothing could persuade them to dive: they\r\nsauntered about, with the right hand passed behind, and holding the left\r\nfore-arm in its grasp. As the elders moved with gravity on the beach,\r\nthe girls romped and raced with the seamen--repelling, without\r\nresenting, their rudeness. They were sprightly and voluble, and chatted\r\non without intermission. On one occasion they were missed, when, turning\r\nto a tree, they were seen perched naked in the branches, about nine feet\r\nfrom the ground: an interesting group, remarks the naturalist.\r\n\r\nIn the incidents of their social life, he saw their character. The\r\nchildren cried! their mothers soothed them with those maternal caresses,\r\nwhich art has not improved. They held them to be decorated by the\r\nFrench, and placed them in their arms. A father corrected a little boy\r\nfor the ancient diversion of throwing stones at another, and the culprit\r\nwept! A lad concealed a basket from a seaman, to amuse by his perplexity\r\nand its dexterous replacement! The clothes given by the French they hung\r\non the bushes, but they valued the tin ware, the axes and saws. The\r\nliberality of their visitors induced them to take more than was given;\r\nbut they seemed unconscious of offence, and whatever was required they\r\nrestored without reluctance. A girl, refusing the French a skin they\r\ndesired to possess, retreated to the woods: her friends were distressed\r\nat her ill-nature. She, at last, complied. A pair of trousers were given\r\nin exchange; she stood between two Frenchmen, leaning on the shoulder of\r\neach, while they guided her errant legs into these novelties of Europe.\r\n\r\nTheir refusal of food, for themselves and children, was from distaste\r\nrather than distrust; and they only discovered suspicion, when the\r\nFrench penetrated the country. They posted a guard, to give notice of\r\nany movement, and when an attempt was made, it was interrupted by the\r\nloud screams of the women, and the entreaties of the men. They resisted\r\nthe intrusion with displeasure, and even menace.\r\n\r\nOn other occasions, they tended on the French with great kindness,\r\nremoving fallen branches from their path; and when the ground was\r\nsloping and slippery, they walked beside them, and held them up.[2] They\r\nrested every half mile, saying _medi_, \"sit down;\" then rising again,\r\nafter a few minutes' rest.\r\n\r\nThey themselves first saw the French: who, having travelled several\r\nmiles, lay down for the night near a brook: their fires betrayed them. A\r\nnative, next morning, pointed to their resting place: laid his head on\r\nhis hand, and closed his eyes. The good-nature of these people never\r\nlanguished: twice, when the French lost their way, they directed them to\r\ntheir ships. They welcomed their visits by raising their hands over\r\ntheir heads, shouting and stamping on the ground. They greeted them as\r\noften as their wanderings brought them in sight of the vessels, and with\r\nthe same friendly sounds bade them adieu.\r\n\r\n[1798.] We owe to Captain Flinders and Dr. Bass the next description of\r\nthe natives. They were saluted by voices from the hills which border the\r\nDerwent; one of these they ascended and saw a man, and two women, who,\r\ncatching up their baskets, scampered away. The man met them with\r\nconfidence: they tried, in vain, to converse with him in the dialects of\r\nNew Holland. They desired him to lead them to his hut; but he hesitated,\r\nand moved slowly in the direction to which he had pointed. Consulting\r\nhis apparent feelings they desisted, and parted in friendship. This was\r\nthe first man they had seen in the island. His countenance, they\r\ndescribe as unusually benignant; his features less negro-like than\r\ncommon, and his manners frank and open. He exhibited neither curiosity\r\nnor fear, nor did he seem attracted by any part of their dress, except\r\ntheir cravats!\r\n\r\nMr. Bass made several expeditions into the country, attended only by his\r\ndogs, and meeting no inhabitants he concluded that their numbers were\r\ninconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe accounts descriptive of native customs, by these authorities, are\r\nfull of errors; but they are the errors of inference, not of\r\nobservation: it is useless to repeat, in order to correct them. The\r\ncolonists have possessed better opportunities, and their acquaintance\r\nwith aboriginal habits supplies more accurate information, than could be\r\nexpected in the volumes of navigators.\r\n\r\nSuch as we have given, is their testimony to the social aspect of the\r\nnative character: nothing unfavorable is omitted. In a people so gentle\r\nand affable, it is difficult to recognise the race afterwards covered\r\nwith sores, wasted by want and vice, or animated with revenge; and who\r\nfilled the colony with disgust and terror.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This Otaheitian was returning from England to his native\r\ncountry. In London, he was the lion of the day: he was introduced to the\r\nfirst circles, and saw whatever in a great city could elevate his ideas:\r\nhis manners acquired the polish of society. Grenville Sharpe (he who\r\nsecured the decision that the soil of Britain gives freedom to the slave\r\nthat touches it) endeavoured to improve his moral sentiments. He pointed\r\nout the practical injustice of polygamy. Omai replied, \"one wife,\r\ngood--two wife, very good--three wife, very very good;\" but he had not\r\nmisunderstood the argument. Taking three knives, he put two of them side\r\nby side, and the other at a distance, and referring to a nobleman who\r\nhad left his wife for a mistress, said--\"there Lord A., and there\r\nMiss ----; and there Lady A. lie down and cry.\" (Life of G. Sharpe.)\r\n\r\nBut the moment he landed, he resumed all the customs of his countrymen,\r\nand employed his knowledge of arms to destroy them. This was the only\r\ntrace of his civilisation which survived the voyage: he had seen regal\r\ngrandeur and mercantile power, but he retained his preference for the\r\nhabits of his then heathen race.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"But these good savages took hold of our arms, and\r\nsupported us.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nThe party dispatched from Sydney, to take possession of the island, and\r\nwho landed in August, on their arrival at Risdon saw nothing of the\r\nnatives. A solitary savage, armed with a spear, afterwards entered the\r\ncamp, and was cordially greeted. He accepted the trinkets which they\r\noffered, but he looked on the novelties scattered about without\r\nbetraying surprise. By his gestures they inferred that he discharged\r\nthem from their trespass. He then turned towards the woods, and when\r\nthey attempted to follow, he placed himself in the attitude of menace,\r\nand poised his spear.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of May, 1804, during the absence of Lieutenant Bowen, the\r\nofficer in command, the first severe collision occurred. Five hundred\r\nblacks, supposed to belong to the Oyster Bay tribe, gathered on the\r\nhills which overlooked the camp: their presence occasioned alarm, and\r\nthe convicts and soldiers were drawn up to oppose them. A discharge of\r\nfire-arms threw them into momentary panic, but they soon re-united. A\r\nsecond, of ball cartridge, brought down many; the rest fled in terror,\r\nand were pursued: it is conjectured that fifty fell.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of this affair differ greatly. By one party they are said\r\nto have assailed a man and woman living in advance of the camp, and to\r\nhave burned their hut. William White, who saw them earliest, and gave\r\nnotice of their approach, declared they then exhibited no hostility, and\r\nwere not near the hut before the collision. They came down in a\r\nsemicircle, carrying waddies but not spears; a flock of kangaroo hemmed\r\nin between them. The women and children attended them. They came\r\nsinging, and bearing branches of trees.\r\n\r\nThis curvilinear mode of marching was noticed by Labillardiere: they\r\nprobably assembled for a corrobory. \"They looked at me,\" said the\r\nwitness, \"with all their eye;\" but they did not attempt to molest him.\r\n\r\nFor the British, it may be alleged that customs, afterwards understood,\r\nwere then less known. They were ignorant of the language and temper of\r\nthe blacks, and the preservation of the settlement was the first\r\nmilitary duty of Lieutenant Moore, who directed the fire. The action was\r\nsudden, and perhaps no statement is exact. The natives were provoked, by\r\nthe occupation of their common place of resort, and it is no discredit\r\nto their character, if even they attempted to expel the intruders.\r\n\r\nA current report, respecting a conflict on the site of the hospital at\r\nHobart Town, received a curious exposition from the Rev. Mr. Knopwood.\r\nIt was a tradition, that a party of blacks assembled there, were\r\ndispersed by a volley of grape shot, and that several fell. Human bones\r\nand grape shot were found; but the reverend gentleman stated that the\r\nbones were the remains of persons who came from India, and who were\r\nburied there; and that the shot were accidentally dropped when the\r\nstores, once kept there, were removed.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of these events were lamentable. The losses of the\r\nnatives, in their ordinary warfare, rarely extended beyond two or three;\r\nbut the havock of their new enemy awakened irremediable distrust. The\r\nsorrows of a savage are transient: not so, his resentment. Every wrong\r\nis new, until it is revenged; and there is no reason to suppose these\r\nterrible sacrifices were ever forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn these collisions, no British subject had fallen; but in the\r\nsucceeding year (1805) a prisoner of the crown was speared, while\r\nfollowing a kangaroo; and two years after (1807) another, named Mundy,\r\nmet with a similar fate. The black had received presents from his hands,\r\nand approaching him in pretended amity, trailed between his toes the\r\nfatal spear. These facts are given to illustrate the cruelty of the\r\nnatives; and it may be presumed that, from the slaughter of Risdon, not\r\nmany could be added to the number. These were, however, the acts of\r\nindividuals, and without concert or much premeditation. It is\r\nconjectured that the first European who perished was Mange, the surgeon\r\nof the _Geographe_, in 1802. The attack was unprovoked, and it is said\r\nunavenged.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of food compelled the British to adopt a mode of life\r\nsomewhat resembling that of the aborigines. Germain, a marine, was\r\nemployed, from 1805 to 1810, in procuring kangaroo, which he hunted\r\nwith dogs: he but rarely carried a gun, slept on the ground in the\r\nsummer, and in the winter on the branches of trees. During his\r\nwanderings, he often encountered the natives, but they offered no\r\nviolence; and he stated, as the result of his experience, that until\r\nbushrangers excited them by cruelties, \"there was no harm in them.\" The\r\ndaughter of a settler of 1804, was left sometimes in their care; their\r\nkindness was among the recollections of her childhood.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were dispersed. The government, unable to supply the\r\ncommon necessaries of life, gave them license to forage: labor could not\r\nbe exacted, nor discipline enforced; and when circumstances altered, it\r\nwas difficult to recall the wanderers, or to recover authority so long\r\nrelaxed. In their intercourse with the natives, licentious and cruel\r\noutlaws committed every species of atrocity which could be suffered by\r\nthe weak in contact with the wicked.\r\n\r\nLord Hobart, under whose auspices the colony was planted, directed the\r\nLieutenant-Governor to conciliate the natives: to preserve them from\r\noppression, and to encourage them to resort for protection to his\r\nauthority. Their natural rights were recognised, but unhappily no\r\nprovision was made to define their interest in the soil of their\r\ncountry. Their migratory habits were unfavorable to official\r\nsupervision, and the success of humane suggestions depended on the\r\ndoubtful concurrence of ignorant cotters and wandering shepherds.\r\n\r\nIn 1810, an order was issued by Governor Collins, forcibly describing\r\nthe wrongs of the natives, and the revenge to which they were prompted.\r\nThey had pursued an officer, residing at Herdsman's Cove, and failing to\r\ncapture him they fired his premises. Two persons, George Getley and\r\nWilliam Russell, had disappeared: it was supposed, the victims of\r\nresentment, awakened by the \"abominable cruelties and murders\" (such is\r\nthe language of Collins) perpetrated by the white people. This Russell\r\nwas himself notorious for skill in their torture--the subject of his\r\nboast. The government declared that persons who wantonly fired on the\r\nnatives, or murdered them \"in cold blood,\" should suffer the last\r\npenalties of the law.[3]\r\n\r\nThe official treatment of the aborigines was not always judicious, or\r\ncalculated to impress the whites with the notion of civil equality. A\r\nnative, whom it was deemed desirable to detain, was fettered by Colonel\r\nCollins. Notwithstanding, he escaped, and was seen long after with the\r\niron on his leg; nor can the punishments inflicted for crimes committed\r\nagainst the blacks, unusual as those punishments were, be given in proof\r\nthat both races were valued alike. It is not, however, true, that\r\ncruelty was always unpunished. A man was severely flogged for exposing\r\nthe ears of a boy he had mutilated; and another for cutting off the\r\nlittle finger of a native, and using it as a tobacco stopper.[4]\r\n\r\nThe natives continued to shun the settlement for many years, but their\r\nconfidence was easily renewed by gentle treatment; it was, however,\r\ncapricious, or more probably it was soon shaken by insult, unknown to\r\nall but themselves. It was desired by Colonel Davey to establish a\r\nfriendly intercourse, and he instructed the men to invite the tribes\r\nthey might encounter. A servant of this governor, employed at South Arm,\r\nsuddenly came on a tribe of thirty-six persons. A native woman, living\r\nwith a white, willingly went forth to communicate the wishes of the\r\nGovernor. They consented to visit Hobart Town, to which they were\r\ntransferred by water. Davey endeavoured to win their confidence, and\r\nthey remained about town for weeks. Having received some offence from\r\nworthless Europeans, they retreated to their woods, and never returned.\r\nThis party attempted to reach Brune Island, and all were drowned, except\r\none woman.\r\n\r\nMr. Knopwood remembered that, in 1813 and 1814, the natives were fed at\r\nhis door. A number of children were forcibly taken from them, and they\r\ndisappeared from the camp.\r\n\r\nColonel Davey bears witness to the continuance of cruelty, which he\r\ncensured in the strongest language of indignation. Certain settlers\r\nestablished a species of juvenile slavery: they followed up the mother,\r\nretarded by the encumbrance of her children, until she was compelled in\r\nher terror to leave them. Well might the Governor declare, that crime so\r\nenormous had fixed a lasting stigma on the British name. These\r\nprovocations produced their usual consequences: by spearing cattle, and\r\nother acts of hostility, a tribe at the Coal River revenged the robbery\r\nof their children; surely, a slight retaliation for such incredible\r\nwickedness.\r\n\r\nAn expedition to Macquarie Harbour, in 1817, discovered a tribe hitherto\r\nunknown. They received the first visit with the usual friendliness--a\r\nfeeling which was, however, of short duration.\r\n\r\nThe Oyster Bay tribe are mentioned. They had begun to exhibit that\r\nspirit of hostility which made them a terror to the colony, and armed\r\nthe entire community against them. They had speared one man, and killed\r\nanother; but the origin of this feeling is distinctly stated: a native\r\nhad been shot in an expedition to capture some aboriginal children.\r\n\r\nSorell prolongs the testimony that tells so mournfully in behalf of the\r\nnatives. He speaks of firing on the blacks as a _habit_; that\r\nchild-stealing was practised in the remoter districts; that settlers had\r\nadopted groundless prejudices against the unfortunate people, as alike\r\nincapable and unworthy of conciliation; that they offered no serious\r\ndiscountenance to the cruelty of their servants. Thus several whites had\r\nperished, and cattle had been speared, in revenge.[5] He reminded the\r\ncolonists that, as their flocks increased and the shepherds extended\r\ntheir range, this obvious method of retaliation, then rarely adopted,\r\nwould multiply the loss both of property and human life. The danger was\r\nproved by examples:--In 1819, a collision occurred; a man on each side\r\nkilled, and cattle and sheep were speared; but, the account continues,\r\nthe stock-keepers detained and maltreated the wife of a chief. Either on\r\nthis, or some such occasion, they were pursued by a party of the 48th\r\nregiment, and seventeen were slain. He maintains very strenuously the\r\nopinion of his predecessors, that the aborigines were not often the\r\naggressors, and that the injuries they inflicted were committed under\r\nthe impulse of recent provocation.\r\n\r\nSorell provided for the native children, except those committed to\r\nprivate hands by their parents, or retained with the express sanction\r\nof himself. There is no reason to doubt, that several of these were\r\norphans, and adopted and reared with the utmost humanity. Among the\r\nexpenses of the times, it is gratifying to observe one item, in the\r\nrental of a house for the entertainment of the aborigines. The\r\nsentiments of Governor Sorell are honorable to his character, and cannot\r\nbe doubted; but we are startled to find, that when charges, so solemnly\r\nimputed, must have been founded upon particular facts, no equal\r\npunishment seems to have overtaken the crimes proclaimed. The government\r\ndisapproved of oppression, but it was either too weak, or too indolent,\r\nto visit the guilty.\r\n\r\nMr. Commissioner Bigge, who came to the colony 1820, in his voluminous\r\nreports, rarely alludes to the natives of these seas. Those of Van\r\nDiemen's Land engaged a very small share of his attention, and in two\r\nbrief paragraphs he describes their character, and disposes of their\r\nclaims. He remarks, that an act of unjustifiable hostility had awakened\r\ntheir resentment, passes over an interval of sixteen years, and\r\nexpresses his conviction that no obstacle they could oppose to\r\ncolonisation, need excite alarm. It is probable, that his instructions\r\nwould but briefly touch on questions relating to these children of the\r\nsoil; but considering that the notices and orders of government must\r\nhave apprised him of their sufferings, he dismisses their case with\r\nastonishing indifference.[6]\r\n\r\nSeveral Wesleyan missionaries visited this island during the years 1821\r\nand 1822. The natives attracted their notice: they described, with\r\nbrevity, their moral and social state; but they did not intimate the\r\nsmallest apprehension of their malice.\r\n\r\nFor several years reference to the aborigines is of rare occurrence. The\r\nyear preceding the first series of outrages, furnished no incident worth\r\ncontemporary record. We are reminded, however, that they survived, by an\r\nact of equestrian audacity. Mr. Risely, looking down Allan Vale, saw a\r\nnaked girl dashing off at full speed, on a valuable horse, which she\r\nbridled by the tether--the first of her race ever known to gallop.\r\nHorsemen pursued her for two days, without overtaking her.\r\n\r\nIn those numerous publications, which precede 1824, the\r\naborigines are always represented as originally friendly, and only\r\ndangerous when excited by cruelty. It was the boast of the times, that\r\nthe whole island could be crossed in safety by two persons armed with\r\nmuskets; and Curr, who wrote latest, does not even mention their\r\nexistence. It is difficult to imagine more decided proof, that at this\r\ntime the depredations of the blacks were neither numerous nor\r\nsanguinary.\r\n\r\nIt is the general opinion, however, that the remonstrances of Sorell had\r\nbeen attended with some success, and that the settlers and stock-keepers\r\nwere not unimpressed with his predictions of a more concerted and\r\ncontinuous revenge; nor can we doubt that many persons of humanity even\r\nexaggerated this peril, to restrain those brutal natures which are\r\nsensible only of personal risk.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"The natives, who have been rendered desperate by the\r\ncruelties they have experienced from our people, have now begun to\r\ndistress us by attacking our cattle. Two were lately wounded by them at\r\nCollins-vale; and three, it is reported, belonging to George Guest, have\r\nbeen killed at Blackman's Bay. As this tribe of natives have hitherto\r\nbeen considered friendly, the change in their conduct must be occasioned\r\nby some outrage on our part, No account having been received up to this\r\ntime of William Russell and George Getley, there can be no doubt of the\r\nmiserable death they have been put to. This unfortunate man, Russell, is\r\na striking instance of divine agency, which has overtaken him at last,\r\nand punished him by the hands of those very people who have suffered so\r\nmuch from him; he being well known to have exercised his barbarous\r\ndisposition in murdering or torturing any who unfortunately came within\r\nhis reach.\"--_The Derwent Star, January 29th, 1810._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Eye-witness.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: \"ORDER.--From the conduct of the native people, when free\r\nfrom any feeling of injury towards those who have held intercourse with\r\nthem, there is strong reason to hope, that they might be conciliated. On\r\nthe north-eastern coast, where boats occasionally touch, and at\r\nMacquarie Harbour, where the natives have been lately seen, they have\r\nbeen found inoffensive and peaceable, _and they are known to be equally\r\ninoffensive, where the stock-keepers treat them with mildness_.\"--March\r\n19, 1819.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Dual, mentioned by Bigge, was transported from Sydney, for\r\nchopping off the right arm of his wife: he said she should \"make no more\r\n_dough-boy_.\" The whites persuaded the natives, that the lighter hue of\r\ntheir half-caste children resulted from the too free use of flour.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to mankind, to trace the causes which led to that\r\nlong and disastrous conflict, in which so many lives were sacrificed,\r\nand a people, all but a fading fragment, became extinct. Among those\r\nmentioned by the government, was the admission into the colony of Sydney\r\nblacks, and the ascendancy which one of them acquired.\r\n\r\nThe emigrants of 1822 remember a number of natives, who roamed about the\r\ndistrict, and were known as the \"tame mob;\" they were absconders from\r\ndifferent tribes, and separated from their chiefs. They often entered\r\nthe town and obtained bread, tobacco, and even rum from the inhabitants.\r\nTheir importunity was troublesome, and their appearance offensive: the\r\neruptive disease which covered their skin, especially on the legs, most\r\nexposed to the heat of their fires, added to their squalor and\r\nwretchedness. They are thus described by the Rev. Mr. Horton: he saw\r\nthem at Pittwater, crouching round their fires, and entirely naked--a\r\ncompany of demoralised savages.\r\n\r\nMusquito became their head. He was transported from Sydney to this\r\ncolony for the murder of a woman. For some time he acted as a\r\nstock-keeper; he was then employed as a guide, in tracking the\r\nbushrangers, having the keenness of vision, and almost canine instinct,\r\nby which in the slightest traces he discovered a certain clue. For this\r\nservice, it is said, he was promised restoration to his country--a\r\npromise, unhappily, forgotten. He was odious to the prisoners, who\r\ntaunted him as a _nose_ for the hangman; his resentful nature could not\r\nbrook the insult, and he struck down a convict who thus reviled him. He\r\nwas then taken into custody; in alarm, he escaped to the bush. The\r\nmuscular strength and superior skill of this man were supposed to have\r\nrecommended him to the natives as their chief. He was seen, by\r\nRobertson, to cut off the head of a pigeon with a stick, while flying.\r\nMusquito answered Mr. Horton with intelligence, when that gentleman\r\nrepresented the misery of a vagrant life; he said that he should prefer\r\nto live like the white man, tilling the ground, but that none of his\r\ncompanions would join him. Before he united with the natives, he was\r\naccustomed to pursue them with all the virulence of a savage. In company\r\nwith a convict servant he would face the darkness, and go out \"to storm\r\nthe huts\" he had seen in the day. On one such occasion, in spite of\r\nprohibitions, he set out at night; but the natives had observed him, and\r\ndecamped, leaving behind them large fires to deceive their enemy.\r\nReturning at midnight, he was mistaken for a Tasmanian black; and, but\r\nfor discovery at the moment, would have suffered the fate he deserved.\r\n\r\nIt was said by Mr. G. Robertson, that the first murders of Musquito were\r\ncommitted in self defence. He associated with the Oyster Bay tribe, and\r\nhis power over them was great: he even prevailed on them to perform some\r\nrude agricultural labor. He had high notions of his own worth: he would\r\nstalk into the cottages of the settlers, seat himself with great\r\ndignity: his followers, to the number of one or two hundred, patiently\r\nawaiting his signal to approach.\r\n\r\nAs the influence of Musquito enlarged, it became more pernicious. He not\r\nonly misled his immediate followers, but propagated his spirit. Deeds of\r\ngreat enormity were committed at his direction; several by his own hand.\r\nHe drew a man from his house at Pittwater, by the _cooey_, and then\r\nspeared him to death. A servant of Mr. Cassidy, and another of Mr.\r\nEvans, met a similar fate. In concert with Tom, a Tasmanian black, he\r\nbecame a terror to the colony. Their parties moved in large bodies, and\r\nacted under a common impulse. In carrying on their depredations, their\r\ntactics aimed at military unity and skill. A party of sixty appeared\r\nbefore the premises of Mr. Hobbs, at the Eastern Marshes (1824): they\r\nwatched the servants deliver their fire, and before they could reload\r\ntheir muskets, they rushed upon them, and by weight of numbers drove\r\nthem off the ground. A few days after, the natives again appeared: a\r\nsmall party came forward first, and reconnoitred; then returning to a\r\nhill, they made signals to a body of a hundred and fifty, in an opposite\r\ndirection. Both divisions bore down on the establishment. The English\r\nwere now well armed, and maintained the post for five hours; but escaped\r\nwhen they saw the natives prepare to surround the dwelling with fire.\r\nOvercome with terror, for several days they refused to return, and the\r\nproperty was left to its fate. Mr. Hobbs was specially unfortunate: his\r\nhouse lay in the track, both of the natives and bushrangers, and thrice\r\nin one season his premises were pillaged.\r\n\r\nThe arrest of Musquito became an object of importance, and Colonel\r\nArthur, then Governor, offered a reward for his capture. Teague, an\r\naboriginal boy, brought up by Dr. Luttrel, was dispatched with two\r\nconstables. They overtook Musquito at Oyster Bay: he resisted, but was\r\nshot in the groin, and being unarmed was captured, with two women, and\r\nconveyed to Hobart town.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved to bring him to justice. By the care of Dr. Scott he was\r\ncured, and transferred from the hospital to gaol. Black Tom was\r\nsubsequently taken, and both were tried for the murder of William\r\nHolyhoak and Patrick M'Arthur. Of the last of these offences the\r\nTasmanian was found guilty, but Musquito was convicted of both.\r\n\r\nMarmoa, an Otaheitian, was killed with Holyhoak: Musquito had lingered\r\nin their neighbourhood, and watched their movements for days; he had\r\nvisited their hut, and received provisions from their hands; but on the\r\nmorning of the murder he purloined the guns and removed the dogs. Mamoa\r\nfell instantly; but the Englishman endured the misery of long pursuit\r\nand several wounds, and dropped at last, pierced through and through\r\nwith spears.\r\n\r\nA murder, ascribed to black Tom, for which he was not put on trial,\r\ndisplayed extraordinary perfidy. This black went to the residence of Mr.\r\nOsborne, of Jericho, demanding bread. His appearance excited great\r\nalarm: Mrs. Osborne was there alone; he, however, left her uninjured.\r\nNext morning her husband ran into the house, exclaiming, \"the hill is\r\ncovered with savages.\" He stood at the door on guard, and endeavoured to\r\nsoothe them. \"What do you want--are you hungry?\" \"Yes, white man,\" said\r\nTom. Mrs. Osborne requested them to put down their spears. Tom\r\nconsented, if the gun were laid aside: this was done. On returning the\r\nsecond time with food, Osborne missed his musket, and then said, \"I am a\r\ndead man.\" Two blacks came forward, and, as if in friendship, each took\r\nhim by the hand. At that moment, a savage behind him thrust a spear\r\nthrough his back; he uttered a loud shriek, sprang convulsively forward,\r\nand fell dead!\r\n\r\nSuch were the men who, in February, 1825, suffered death with six\r\nEuropean criminals. They were unassisted by counsel, and perhaps the\r\nevidence was not fully understood by them. It is useless, however, to\r\nextenuate their treachery: and their execution, whether politic or not,\r\ncan scarcely be accounted unjust. But, unhappily, these deeds of\r\nbarbarity were not left to the vengeance of the law. The colonists, of\r\nhigher grades, preserved the distinction between the guilty and the\r\ninnocent, which it is the object of public trials to establish; but the\r\nlower orders, and especially the dissolute and the worthless, justified\r\nhatred to the race, and finally, systematic massacre by the individual\r\nacts of such men as Musquito.\r\n\r\nIt is instructive, if not amusing, to observe how nicely the theory of\r\nsome philosophers and the sentiments of the lowest European robbers,\r\nmeet together; how, what one predicts, the other executes. The supposed\r\neternal laws of nature are accomplished by the wild license of an\r\nEnglish savage. It became the serious conviction of stockmen, that\r\nblacks are brutes, only of a more cunning and dangerous order--an\r\nimpression which has long ceased in this colony, but which still\r\nflourishes in Australia Felix.\r\n\r\nBent, the proprietor of the only newspaper published at that time,\r\nreferring to the outrages of the hostile blacks, seemed to dread these\r\ndoctrines. With great consideration he detaches Musquito's guilt from\r\nthe tribes in general: a distinction by no means trite or universally\r\nrecognised. \"Until corrupted by the Sydney natives they were,\" he\r\nasserts, \"the most peaceable race in existence.\" These suggestions\r\ndeserve more praise than the highest literary skill.\r\n\r\nThe disposition to conciliate the blacks eventually contributed to the\r\nsame disastrous consequences. A tribe, of sixty, appeared in Hobart\r\nTown, November, 1824: they came in a peaceable manner, their visit was\r\nunexpected, and its cause unknown. On the first notice of their\r\napproach, the Governor went forth to meet them: he assigned three places\r\nfor their fires, supplied them with food and blankets, and appointed\r\nconstables to protect them. They departed suddenly, and on their journey\r\nattempted to spear a white man. Whether the abrupt retreat resulted\r\nfrom caprice or distrust, it did not prevent a similar visit to\r\nLaunceston in the following December. There were 200 in this party. When\r\ncrossing Patterson's Plains they were wantonly fired on by the whites,\r\nand in their return some of their women were treated with indescribable\r\nbrutality.[7] When they reached the Lake River, two sawyers, who had\r\nnever before suffered molestation, were wounded by their spears. The\r\nrecent cruelty they had experienced fully accounted for their rage.\r\n\r\nIt was the anxious desire of the Governor to establish a native\r\ninstitution, deriving its funds partly from the public purse and partly\r\nfrom private benevolence. A code was prepared by the Rev. Messrs.\r\nBedford and Mansfield; and a public meeting held in the church of St.\r\nDavid, the Governor presiding, approved the regulations; but at that\r\ntime the colony was distracted by the ravages of robbers, and its\r\nfinancial resources were depressed: and the prevailing opinion that\r\ncivilisation was impossible, still further embarrassed the project, and\r\nconfined the hopes of the most sanguine to the rising generation. Mr.\r\nMansfield rested his expectation rather on the power of God than upon\r\nhuman probabilities.\r\n\r\nThe civilisation of a barbarous people is, perhaps, impossible, in the\r\npresence of organised communities of white men. The contrast is too\r\ngreat, and the points of contact too numerous and irritating. Never have\r\ncolonists civilised aborigines; but the failure is easily explained,\r\nwithout recourse to egotistical superstition, that the white man's\r\nshadow is, to men of every other hue, by law of Heaven, the shadow of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe children of aborigines, adopted by the whites, when they grew to\r\nmaturity, were drawn to the woods, and resumed the habits of their\r\nkindred. A black girl, trained in Launceston, thus allured, laid aside\r\nher clothing, which she had worn nearly from infancy. It was thus with\r\nmany: a sense of inferiority to the youth about them, united with the\r\nmysterious interest which every heart feels in kindred sympathies, is\r\nsufficient to account for these relapses. Examples will crowd upon the\r\nmemory of the reader, in which the polish and caresses of the British\r\ncapital did not disqualify the savage to re-enter with zest on the\r\nbarbarous pursuits of his forefathers.\r\n\r\nThe desire for sugar, bread, and blankets, could only be regularly\r\ngratified by an abandonment of migratory habits.\r\n\r\nWhen remote from the government stores, the natives still coveted what\r\nthey could not obtain, but as spoil. They had learned to prefer articles\r\nof steel to the crystal, and they acquired an imperfect mastery of\r\nfire-arms. Some were, however, exceedingly expert; a chief, conciliated\r\nby Robinson, brought down an eagle hawk, with all the airs of a\r\npractised sportsman. Thus their untutored nature could not resist the\r\ntemptation created by new wants: they watched the hut of the\r\nstock-keeper, which they stripped during his absence; till, growing more\r\ndaring, they disregarded his presence; and even the populous districts,\r\nand establishments of considerable force, were not safe from their\r\ndepredations.\r\n\r\nAt the time when they first became formidable, armed bushrangers scoured\r\nthe colony; sometimes the allies of the natives, much oftener their\r\noppressors.[8] Outlaws themselves, they inculcated the arts of violence.\r\nThe improved caution and cunning of the natives, so often noticed by the\r\ngovernment, were ascribed, in no small degree, to the treacherous\r\nlessons of degraded Europeans. But when the bushranger did not employ\r\nthese people as the instrument of his designs, by fear or cruelty, often\r\nhe destroyed them: thus Lemon and Brown set up the natives as marks to\r\nfire at. The irritated savage confounded the armed, though unoffending\r\nstock-keeper, with his marauding countrymen, and missing the object of\r\nhis premeditated vengeance, speared the first substitute he encountered.\r\nThis conclusion is amply supported by facts. The common principles which\r\naffect the minds of nations towards each other; the reprisals, which are\r\nvindicated in civilised war, only differ in circumstance. A thousand\r\ninjuries, never recorded, if stated in a connexion with these results,\r\nwould enable us to see how often the harmless settler was sacrificed to\r\npassions, provoked by his robber countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn 1826, a remarkable instance was brought under the notice of\r\ngovernment. Dunne, who at length met the punishment he deserved, seized\r\na woman, and forced her to the hut of Mr. Thompson, on the Shannon,\r\nwhere he detained her with violence; she, however, escaped to her\r\npeople, and roused them to avenge her. Dunne, next morning, suddenly\r\nfound himself in their midst: his musket protected him, and after hours\r\nof such torture as his conscience and fears might inflict, he managed to\r\nget off. On the following day, the woman led her tribe, vociferating\r\nthreats, to the hut in which she had been maltreated, where they\r\nmassacred James Scott, a man with whom they had lived in friendship for\r\nmany years, and who, when warned a few days before to be on his guard,\r\nsmiled at the notion of danger.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of some of these women was such, as no one can be expected\r\nto credit, until prepared by extensive acquaintance with human\r\ndepravation. A monster boasted that, having captured a native woman,\r\nwhose husband he had killed, he strung the bleeding head to her neck,\r\nand drove her before him as his prize. Had not this fact been guaranteed\r\nby formal enquiry, it could only have been admitted as a specimen of\r\nbrutal gasconade, and in proof of how much a cruel fancy could exceed\r\nthe actual guilt of mankind. It sometimes happened, that an unfortunate\r\nservant would receive the spear intended for his predecessor in the same\r\nemploy, to whom it was justly due. Among the whites, there were men\r\ndistinguished for the malicious vigour with which they tracked and\r\nmurdered the native people. A lad, on his arrival from England, was sent\r\ninto the interior, and warned never to wander from his dwelling; but he\r\nforgot the danger he did not see, and straying a short distance, he was\r\nmurdered. He had never injured his destroyers; but then he lived on the\r\nlands just before in charge of a villain, and who, like a Roman warrior,\r\ntook his name of \"Abyssinian Tom,\" from the locality of his exploits.\r\n\r\nThe infliction of judicial punishments, interrupted the friendly\r\nintercourse of the tribe that visited Hobart Town, and who were\r\nencouraged to resort to Kangaroo Point, where huts were erected for\r\ntheir use. The arrest of two of their number filled them with\r\napprehension. The aborigines, Jack and Dick, were executed on the 16th\r\nSeptember, 1826, an event which terminated all present hope of amicable\r\nrelations. The murder of a shepherd at Oyster Bay, Great Swan Port, was\r\nproved against them by the evidence of convict stock-keepers; a topic of\r\ncontemporary complaint: but the courts regularly relied on the same\r\nclass of witnesses, and in this case there is no special reason for\r\nsuspicion. The fact was not questioned: the culprits had been treated\r\nwith kindness by the government, and efforts had been made by Colonel\r\nArthur to acquaint them with the obligations of British subjects. He\r\nasserts that, by personal interviews, he was fully convinced that they\r\nunderstood the benevolent views of the crown. One of these blacks was so\r\nfar civilised, as to be admitted to the sacrament of the English church.\r\nHis companion was a youth, and denied his guilt. The old black was\r\ncarried to the scaffold, and resisted the execution: the younger,\r\ndisentangled his arms, and struggled for his life. It was, indeed, a\r\nmelancholy spectacle. Successive Governors had witnessed crimes against\r\ntheir race, atrocious and unpunished: hundreds had fallen unavenged by\r\nthat public justice which treated them as murderers.\r\n\r\nOn the day of their execution, the Governor addressed the colony. He\r\nvindicated this act of severity, as requisite to intimidate the blacks;\r\nbut he solemnly pledged his government to equal justice, and that the\r\nlaw should take its course on individuals of either race, who might\r\nviolate \"the common law of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussions which followed, proved the division of public opinion on\r\nthe propriety of this measure. It was not clear, to many, that the\r\nnatives were legally accountable, or that their punishment was just.\r\nGrotius and Vattel were quoted; writers, who have discoursed upon the\r\nrelations of man, and distinguished the felon from the enemy. It was,\r\nhowever, simply a question between judicial and private vengeance: the\r\ninterference of the court could alone prevent a general proscription. In\r\nthe heat of anger, no provocation would be weighed--no palliative\r\nadmitted; and the innocent would perish with the guilty.[9]\r\n\r\nThe impression on the aborigines was unfavorable: they saw only the\r\ndeath of an unfortunate countryman, and, perhaps, the last act of the\r\nwhite man's warfare. Its moral influence was not great on either race:\r\nit neither softened the resentment of the British, nor intimidated the\r\nblacks: it was a mere variety in the forms of destruction. The brother\r\nof one of these men led the Oyster Bay tribe, and prompted the murders\r\nwhich, in 1830, filled the colony with wailing.\r\n\r\nThe rapid colonisation of the island from 1821 to 1824, and the\r\ndiffusion of settlers and servants through districts hitherto\r\nunlocated, added to the irritation of the natives, and multiplied the\r\nagents of destruction. Land unfenced, and flocks and herds moving on\r\nhill and dale, left the motions of the native hunters free; but hedges\r\nand homesteads were signals which even the least rationality could not\r\nfail to understand, and on every re-appearance the natives found some\r\nfavorite spot surrounded by new enclosures, and no longer theirs.\r\n\r\nThe proclamations of the government assumed the fixed relations of the\r\ndifferent tribes to particular districts. Oyster Bay and the Big River\r\nwere deemed sufficiently precise definitions of those tribes, exposed to\r\npublic jealousy and prosecution. It is true, they had no permanent\r\nvillages, and accordingly no individual property in land; but the\r\nboundaries of each horde were known, and trespass was a declaration of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe English, of modern times, will not comprehend joint ownership,\r\nnotwithstanding the once \"common\" property of the nation has been only\r\nlately distributed by law. The rights of the aborigines were never\r\nrecognised by the crown; yet it is not less certain that they saw with\r\nintelligence the progress of occupation, and felt that the gradual\r\nalienation of their hunting grounds implied their expulsion and\r\nextinction.\r\n\r\nNative topography is, indeed, limited; but it is exact. Every mountain,\r\nvalley, and river, is distinguished and named. The English have often\r\nbeen indebted to these primitive surveyors, for guidance through the\r\nforests which they came to divide. The tribes took up their periodical\r\nstations, and moved with intervals so regular, that their migrations\r\nwere anticipated, as well as the season of their return. The person\r\nemployed in their pursuit, by the aid of his native allies, was able to\r\npredict at what period and place he should find a tribe, the object of\r\nhis mission; and though months intervened, he found them in the valley,\r\nand at the time he had foretold. Expectations of this sort could only be\r\njustified by the regularity of their movements, and the exact knowledge\r\nof the guides.[10] Nor were they indifferent to the charms of a native\r\nland. A visitor enquired of a native woman at Flinders, whether she\r\npreferred that place to several others mentioned, where she had lived at\r\ntimes, and she answered with indifference; but when, to test her\r\nattachment to her early haunts, the querist said, \"and not Ringarooma?\"\r\nshe exclaimed, with touching animation, \"Oh yes! Ringarooma!\r\nRingarooma!\"\r\n\r\nA chief accompanied the commandant to Launceston in 1847. At his own\r\nearnest request, he was taken to see the Cataract Basin of the South\r\nEsk, a river which foams and dashes through a narrow channel of\r\nprecipitous rocks, until a wider space affords it tranquillity. It was a\r\nstation of his people; precisely the kind of spot which gypsies, on the\r\n\"business of Egypt,\" would choose for their tents. As he drew nigh, his\r\nexcitement was intense: he leaped from rock to rock, with the gestures\r\nand exclamations of delight. So powerful were his emotions, that the lad\r\nwith him became alarmed, lest the associations of the scene should\r\ndestroy the discipline of twelve years exile: but the woods were silent:\r\nhe heard no voice save his own, and he returned pensively with his young\r\ncompanion. These examples shew, that the native was not an indifferent\r\nspectator of that rapid occupation, which must have appeared prodigious\r\nto scattered tribes.\r\n\r\nA further cause of exasperation, consequent on the preceding, was the\r\ndestruction of game. The extent to which it was carried was enormous.\r\nThe skin of the kangaroo sold for a few pence, was the perquisite of the\r\nstock-keepers, and long the chief object of their daily enterprise.\r\nTheir rugs, their clothing, were composed often of these spoils, and the\r\npursuit did not slacken until the persecuted animal retired. Jeffery,\r\ndescribing the field sports of his day (1810), tells us that flocks of\r\nemu and kangaroo were found at short intervals, and that a cart might be\r\nloaded with their flesh by the sport of a morning; but he remained long\r\nenough, to observe a sensible diminution, and proposed limitations by\r\nlaw to the havoc of the whites; an idea, subsequently entertained by the\r\n_Aborigines' Committee_, which sat in 1830. The dogs, trained to hunt\r\nthe kangaroo, were at first serviceable to the natives, but they often\r\nincreased the destruction by their spontaneous ravening. It is observed\r\nby a writer of 1827, that forty or fifty would be found within short\r\ndistances, run down by the dogs, and left to rot.\r\n\r\nThus the food, on which the people depended for subsistence, was\r\ndiminished, and the temptation to rob the settlers was regularly\r\naugmented at every return. Sir George Arthur, in his letter to the\r\nSecretary of State in 1828, notices this topic as a complaint of the\r\nnatives against the intrusion of the whites, and seems to admit its\r\ntruth; but three years after, he affirms that game was still abundant in\r\nthe districts appointed for the tribes. It is, however, to be observed,\r\nthat he wrote when the blacks, as a people, were dead; and when the high\r\nvalue of labor had withdrawn many from the chase; and that he implies a\r\nlocal, rather than a pervading abundance. As the natives passed through\r\nthe settled districts to the sea shore, if numerous, their requirements\r\nwould be great; but, by scattering themselves abroad, to obtain a\r\nsufficiency, their dangers would increase, and every evening they would\r\nmuster fewer than in the morning.[11]\r\n\r\nAmong the causes of enmity, referred to by writers of every period, the\r\nabduction of the women by sealers and others, is noticed the earliest,\r\nand continued to the last. The sealers were, chiefly, either convicts\r\nwhose sentences had expired, or such as contrived to escape. In the\r\nislands of the Straits, they indulged the boundless license of their\r\npassions, blending the professions of the petty pirate and the\r\nfisherman. A chain of rocks enabled them to rove to a considerable\r\ndistance, picking up the refuse of the sea, and feeding on the aquatic\r\nbirds which frequented the islets in great abundance. Many, however,\r\nperished, with the frail boats to which they committed their lives.\r\nTheir first stage was known as \"Clarke's Island;\" from thence they made\r\n\"Preservation Island:\" a succession of rocks formed land marks in their\r\ncourse to New Holland, from which many found their way to Kangaroo\r\nIsland, the Ultima Thule of their geography. In these places, they\r\nengaged in sealing; the produce of which they sold to the small craft\r\ntrading among them, for guns, spirits, and tobacco. When the season was\r\nover, they retired to the interior, and passed their days in alternate\r\nslumber and intoxication.\r\n\r\nSo secure were some of these retreats, that they justified the\r\napprehension, that formidable pirates would be trained up in their\r\nlawless and licentious communities. They were perpetually disturbed by\r\nviolence. One old man spent thirteen years on an island, alone. He\r\ncultivated a plot of ground, and sold the produce to the boats which\r\nfloated about. Several times robbed of his crops and clothing, by these\r\ncontemptible spoilers, he, at last, was compelled to renounce his rude\r\nindependence. In King's Island, families sat down; but Colonel Arthur,\r\nsensible of the great danger of these associations, sent the harbour\r\nmaster to the Straits, who arrested absconders, and released native\r\nwomen from slavery.\r\n\r\nBy these men, the black women and female children were captured in\r\nexcursions to this island, and were liable to the ill-treatment, which\r\nmight be expected from men who regarded them with passion and contempt.\r\nThey were employed as slaves on some islands, to strip the mutton bird,\r\nand in whatever irksome labor was within their capacity. It is said that\r\none man (Harrison), had fourteen women in his service, whom he flogged\r\nwith military severity, and some of whom he put to death.\r\n\r\nBoatswain, an aged woman, stolen in her youth, related the manner of her\r\nabduction. She was induced to enter a boat, without suspicion of the\r\ndesign, when her captors rowed away, and confined her on an island in\r\nthe Straits. She told her treatment, in broken English and expressive\r\npantomime; first spreading forth her hands, as if fastened to the wall;\r\nthen, with loud cries, gradually becoming fainter, she fell down into a\r\npretended swoon: thus describing the mode and severity of her torture.\r\n\r\nThese men acquired an extraordinary dominion over the fears of the\r\nwomen, sufficient to induce them to dissemble in the presence of\r\nstrangers. Backhouse relates, that two girls, Jumbo and Jackey,\r\npretended, while in the company of their masters, either by silence, or\r\nfeigned anger, to resent the proposal to take them away; but when they\r\nwere assured that their liberty would be protected, they embraced it\r\nwith joy.\r\n\r\nJeffreys, whose narrative is tinged with romance, depicts the fondness\r\nand contentment of the women in lively colors. Glad to escape the\r\ntyranny of their countrymen, they displayed to these amiable white men,\r\nwarm, though jealous, affection;--whose occasional absence they\r\nregretted, and for whose speedy return they invoked some imaginary deity\r\nin plaintive melodies! It is not improbable, that they were sensible of\r\nkindness, but it is very certain that this was not their ordinary lot.\r\nUnanimous testimony permits no doubt that they experienced the severity,\r\nwhich men of low intellect, and of fierce and capricious passions,\r\ninflict on women of an inferior race.\r\n\r\nThe sealers, when they came to the main land, rarely brought their\r\ncaptives: they were in danger of losing them. Their fickleness or\r\nrevenge, was sometimes fatal: in 1824, a party, engaged in an expedition\r\nto entice the girls of a tribe, took with them one who had a half-caste\r\ninfant, and sent her on shore as a decoy. She returned, bringing\r\npromises from her countrywomen to appear the following day; but at that\r\ntime the blacks descended in great force, and all the adventurers,\r\nexcept one, were slain.\r\n\r\nThe sealers, by the names they gave the women, which were rarely\r\nfeminine, and were sometimes ludicrously absurd, indicated the notions\r\nwhich prevailed. However slight their apparent importance, it has been\r\njustly observed, they betray the low civilisation of the persons who\r\ninvented, and the degraded condition of those who bore them.\r\n\r\nThe intercourse of the stockmen was generally confined to the periods of\r\nmigration: sometimes with the connivance, at others, the express consent\r\nof the men; but the detention was often compulsory. Dr. Ross found a\r\nstock-keeper seated on a fallen tree, exhausted with hunger. He had\r\nchained a woman to a log, \"to tame her;\" but she escaped, with his only\r\nshirt, which he had bestowed in his fondness. For five hours he had\r\npursued her, catching glimpses of his shirt through the breaks of the\r\nforest: at last, this signal disappeared; and having lost his way for\r\ntwo days, he was in danger of starvation.\r\n\r\nSuch were the various causes, which combined first to alarm, and then to\r\ngoad into madness, this unhappy people. They were troublesome, and were\r\nrepelled. Wantonly wounded and shot down, they retaliated. Fresh wrongs\r\nproduced their kind: at length, every white man was a _guerilla_, and\r\nevery black an assassin. The original temper of both parties was\r\nchanged. Dread detestation and treachery embittered every mind: even the\r\nhumane yielded to the general sentiment. It became a question, which\r\nrace should perish, and every man's verdict was in favor of his own.\r\n\r\nFrom this, however, it is not to be inferred, that the natives were\r\noriginally treacherous and cruel. It was stated by the Aborigines'\r\nCommittee, in the middle of the conflict, that such dispositions were\r\nthe substratum of their character, which, though disguised, only waited\r\nfor time and opportunity. The colonists in general, at last, believed\r\nthem to delight in blood, by an innate cruelty of temper--to find\r\npleasure in the terrors they excited, and the convulsive agonies of the\r\ndying; but the records of mankind are full of such moral\r\ntransformations. The Indians of America, we are informed by Dr. Dwight,\r\nbecame corrupt, to a degree \"enormous and dreadful: full of malice,\r\ncruelty, and murders.\" But he himself, elsewhere remarks, that within\r\nhis observation white men, commonly sober, moral, and orderly, on\r\njoining a mob, lost every one of these qualities; and, in a few hours of\r\nexcitement, exhibited more vice than he had witnessed for years. The\r\ncauses of degeneracy are not examined, when its mischief is suffered.\r\nSir George Arthur, in his despatches, asserted that the natives were,\r\nand had been, \"a most treacherous race,\"--a view, which the Committee\r\nadopted: these opinions were afterwards greatly modified; nor would it\r\nbe just to admit their truth, without stronger evidence than history\r\naffords. Among the aborigines, some were distinguished for ferocity:\r\nsuch was a woman who led on the Big River tribe, and who was called by\r\nMr. Robinson, the \"Amazon.\" A few were guilty of the crimes imputed to\r\nthe race: and who were often their oppressors, rather than their\r\navengers.\r\n\r\nThough individuals, undoubtedly, displayed the vices imputed, who will\r\ncondemn the natural disposition of a people for actions committed at\r\nlone intervals, by solitary assassins and marauders? The English alone\r\ncould preserve a record of the past, and after a careful examination no\r\nother conclusion is possible, than that whoever continued acts of\r\nferocity and cruelty, the impulse and the example were European.\r\n\r\nDr. Ross, arriving in 1822, passed into the interior, and settled on a\r\nfarm. He was soon visited by the natives, whom he entertained with the\r\nconsideration due to their ignorance and their rights. They had kindled\r\ntheir fires in perilous contiguity, and the flames threatened to destroy\r\nhis crops. He pointed out his danger, and they instantly combined to\r\nextinguish the flame, and transferred their temporary resting place to a\r\nspot, from which no harm could be communicated. Dr. Ross stood by, and\r\nwatched their cookery, and they offered him a part of their food: he\r\nsuffered himself to be amused with their loud merriment, and their\r\nevolutions in the water. They often renewed their visits, and rather\r\ncontributed to his safety, by assisting in the pursuit of white robbers:\r\nand even when they inflicted dreadful outrages on many others, provoked\r\nby extraordinary mal-treatment, they still preserved their kindness for\r\nthis amiable man, until they were finally removed to Flinders' Island.\r\n\r\nThese incidents were not uncommon:--the cross lights, which seem to\r\nexhibit variously the character of a race, but in reality identify the\r\nfamily of man. To judge of a people, during a season of extraordinary\r\nexcitement, must tend to erroneous conclusions: thus, when we turn to\r\ncontemporary writings, we are amazed at the ferocity of expression--the\r\nsweeping and sanguinary appeals, by which they are disfigured; but this\r\nastonishment is corrected, when we examine the incidents they record,\r\nand recollect how little qualified men are to reason, when they are\r\ndoomed to suffer. So with the native: the delirium of rage, and the\r\ntaste for blood, had been produced by causes of long operation; and he\r\nappeared to be a fiend full of mischief and spite, marked out by his\r\ncrimes for utter extinction.[12]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The ruffians who maltreated them were, indeed, punished\r\nwith 25 lashes!]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Whether from policy or humanity, Michael Howe formed an\r\nexception. He did not allow them to be molested, except \"in battle;\" and\r\nhe flogged with the _cat_ one of his comrades, who had broken \"the\r\narticles,\" by wantonly wounding a native.--Stated by a companion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: In sentencing Rodger, at Port Phillip, 1842, Judge Willis\r\ntold him that he had been tried by an intelligent jury; that he could\r\nhave challenged any of them; that to say he had never been in a court of\r\njustice before, was a common plea with white malefactors, and that he\r\nknew as much on the subject as many immigrants. When he was sentenced,\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Hurst explained to him, that he would be hanged! This was\r\nrequisite, as the judge's address was utterly unintelligible.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: \"The natives are tenacious of their hunting grounds, as\r\nthe settlers are of their farms, and are displeased when they find\r\nhouses upon them.

T. Dove._\r\n\r\n\"It was a great oversight, that a treaty was not made with the natives;\r\n_that_ _feeling of injustice, which I am persuaded they have always\r\nentertained_, would have then had no existence.\"--_Sir George Arthur's\r\nDespatch to Lord Glenelg_, 1835.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: \"The extension of the settled districts upon their usual\r\nhunting grounds, has either driven them entirely from them, or removed\r\nthe kangaroo.

To preserve their crops, some settlers were obliged to\r\nemploy hunters. In 1831, from Bothwell only, 100,000 skins were sent to\r\nHobart Town, bearing a value of L2,000.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nThe violence of the natives seemed to require some extraordinary means\r\nfor its repression, and (in November, 1826) it was resolved to capture\r\nthe leaders, by the usual methods of arrest. The magistrates were\r\nauthorised, by the Governor, when danger was feared, to drive them to a\r\nsafe distance by force: to repress their attempts at disturbance, by\r\ntreating them as rioters; to seize those charged with felonies, whether\r\nknown by marks or by names, or by the denomination of their tribe; and\r\nany person was authorised to raise the neighbourhood, on witnessing the\r\ncommission of a crime. This notice was renewed the following year, and\r\nthe military stationed in the interior, were instructed to render such\r\nassistance as might be necessary, for its practical application.\r\n\r\nBut these measures were not attended with much success, and in April,\r\n1828, the natives were forbidden to enter the settled districts of the\r\ncolony. They were permitted to pass through them, when on their passage\r\nto the shore, provided their chiefs guaranteed their quietness, and\r\npossessed a pass under the hand and seal of the Governor. A line, drawn\r\nfrom Piper's River to St. Patrick's Head, separated the regions allotted\r\nto them on that side; another, included Tasman's Peninsula; a third,\r\nsouthward of Mount Wellington to the ocean; and the fourth, from the\r\nHuon, by Western Bluff, south-west to the sea. Thus the proclamation cut\r\nout the centre of the island: a square at the north-west,\r\nbelonged to the Van Diemen's Land Company, and others; southward, from\r\nBen Lomond, including most of the rivers, plains, and lagoons. Into\r\nthese, they were forbidden to intrude. There remained, the forests\r\nof the south-west; the western coasts, where the skies for ever weep;\r\nand the barren shores of the north-east. To drive them on these regions\r\n was the duty of the forces, and their employment for years. The natives\r\n returned regularly with the season, like birds of passage--avenging\r\nthe losses of their last retreat: they retired at the usual\r\ntime--diminished, but unsubdued.\r\n\r\nIn looking at these orders and proclamations, it is impossible to regard\r\nthem in any other light than as plans of military operation. That the\r\nnatives would surrender to a warrant or a challenge; that they would\r\nremain in remote regions, from which they had always been accustomed to\r\ncome forth; that their chiefs had power to enforce the mandates of the\r\nGovernor, or that they would preserve an official document, they could\r\nneither read nor understand--these were contingencies which, though\r\ndesirable, were certainly not probable. The precise and legal language\r\nof the instruments, provoked much ridicule, and might justify a smile.\r\nThey were chiefly dictated by a gentleman, whose mental aberration led\r\nto his removal from office. It is, however, difficult to suggest more\r\nexplicit forms, and the announcement of the plans of government was a\r\nproper preliminary to their execution.\r\n\r\nIt was the desire of the Governor, earnestly expressed, to protect the\r\nsettlers, and yet to mitigate their resentment. The use of arms was\r\nforbidden, while other means were untried, and rewards were offered to\r\nany person who might venture into communication with the natives, to\r\nexplain the objects of the government. They were invited to seek redress\r\nof their grievances; and pictures were suspended in the wood, in which\r\nthe white man was represented shooting the native, and the Governor\r\nhanging the white.\r\n\r\nThese remedies were, however, ineffectual; and in November, 1828, the\r\nsettled districts were placed under the protection of martial law. Nine\r\nparties, under Messrs. G. Robertson, Batman, and Jorgenson, consisting\r\nof seven persons each, and assisted by the military when requisite, were\r\nemployed to enforce the proclamation. Mr. Anstey, the magistrate,\r\ndirected the operations in the centre of the island, and volunteers not\r\nunfrequently joined in the repulsion or pursuit of this unhappy people.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated chief, Eumarrah, was captured by Mr. Gilbert Robertson,\r\nin the Eastern Marshes, in 1828. This euphonius name, which so interests\r\nthe ear, it is said, was a corruption or improvement of the name of a\r\ncolonist, Hugh Murray, and adopted by the savage. A strong party,\r\nconsisting of military and constables, surrounded the hut, in which this\r\nchief and others were sheltered. Five furious dogs rush towards Mr.\r\nRobertson, the foremost of the party: having fired off his piece, and\r\nseized a lad scrambling away, by him he was directed to a sheet of bark,\r\nunder which Eumarrah was concealed. While prostrate, a shot was fired at\r\nhim, which inflicted a flesh wound, and the musket of a soldier was\r\nbroken by beating him. Such is Robertson's indignant account of his\r\ncapture. With the chief, three others, Jack, Dolly, and Jemmy, were\r\ntaken: the portrait of the last has rather an innocent expression, and\r\nhas been honored with publication. This party, removed first to\r\nRichmond, and then to Hobart Town, soon appeared reconciled to their\r\ncaptivity: all, but Eumarrah. He was pensive and reserved, and, for a\r\ntime, resented his bondage. It is said, the outrages he had committed,\r\nwould have forfeited his life, had not his captor earnestly maintained\r\nthat he was a prisoner of war; and that to put him to death, would be to\r\nequal his crimes.\r\n\r\nThe expeditions were attended with the same general incidents, and it\r\nwould be tedious to multiply examples. The number of prisoners was\r\nlamentably disproportioned to the many that perished. To identify a\r\nparticular offender was impossible, nor was it of much importance, since\r\nthe natives now were animated by one spirit. The amazing agility with\r\nwhich they moved; their magical powers of self concealment; their\r\ndestitution of dress, the greasing of their skin, and the vigilance of\r\ntheir watch-dogs, rendered it nearly impossible to seize them in open\r\nday.\r\n\r\nAn alarm would be given, that the blacks were approaching, and a party,\r\ncommissioned to repress them, would immediately advance; often\r\nblundering and incautious, shouting, smoking, and straggling about;\r\ncarelessly firing their pieces, and affording abundant information of\r\ntheir approach. Thus, after a fatiguing march, the natives, whom they\r\nwere sent out to meet, would be observed in their rear, having already\r\ncommitted the premeditated depredation. Not that it was easy to elude\r\ntheir observation, if they were conscious of pursuit, and it was nearly\r\nimpossible to overtake them.\r\n\r\nMr. Gilbert Robertson, after capturing Eumarrah, was twelve months\r\nwithout success. One tribe he followed with pertinacity, were not far\r\noff through the whole chase. Their fires were visible: they were, for\r\nseveral days, on the hills, not more than four miles from the British;\r\nbut they \"beat round and round, like a hare.\" A tribe, after a hot\r\npursuit, concealed their tracks, and suddenly vanished. They regularly\r\nposted sentinels: passed over the most dangerous ground, and, on the\r\nmargin of fearful precipices: they would lie down beside a log--stone\r\ndead, and could not be distinguished from the charred fragments of the\r\nforest. Those who imagined that their eyes had never been averted, would\r\nyet lose sight of the subtle enemy. They could not catch them, except by\r\nstratagem; or, when they were caught, they could not hold them.[13] The\r\nfew captives that were obtained, when they thought proper, easily made\r\ntheir escape. They confined them in a room: next morning, they had\r\npassed through the flue into the open air, and freedom.\r\n\r\nThe extreme difficulty connected with their arrest by day, led to their\r\nrapid destruction. The pursuers would watch, as the evening gathered in,\r\nthe thin smoke of the distant fires: they would cautiously advance, and\r\nconceal themselves till midnight. The superstitious terror of the black,\r\nprevented his wandering from the camp, lest the evil spirit that\r\nhaunted the darkness should carry him away. Thus, stretched around the\r\nfire, the natives were easily seen, and musketry told with terrible\r\neffect. Their dogs, instead of promoting their safety, sometimes led to\r\ntheir sacrifice. A party, preparing to surround and capture them without\r\nbloodshed, would move with quiet steps, without giving notice to the\r\naborigines; but just when all was prepared for the last movement, some\r\ncur of ill omen would start up, and rouse them. They would seize their\r\nspears and attempt to flee; and the whites, now disappointed of a\r\nbloodless capture, would commence the slaughter.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, a tribe of natives threw stones at the constables, from a hill.\r\nThey returned a volley of shot; then charged with the bayonet: the whole\r\nwere slain. The excuse for the massacre was, that having no more\r\nammunition, the constables had no other means of defence, and that to\r\nretreat was dangerous. An exploit, claimed by a corporal and party of\r\nthe 40th regiment, is disputed. They professed to have discovered a\r\ntribe lodged on the shelf of a rock, inclosed by wall-like heights. They\r\npoured in their fire, and dragged the women and children from their\r\nshelter: all perished. This was stated to be a mere tale of pretended\r\nsuccess, and devised to satisfy the neighbourhood, that the men had done\r\ntheir duty. It proves, at least, that such achievements were in request.\r\nHow fearful a condition for the government to tolerate, or for a colony\r\nto approve.\r\n\r\nIn these expeditions, natives were often the guides, and were enabled to\r\nfollow up the track of their countrymen, when the English were\r\nconfounded. In those troublesome times, individuals of the tribes were\r\noften left behind. It was the custom to fix small pieces of stick at\r\nshort distances, to assist the stragglers in rejoining their main body.\r\nFor a time, these signals being understood by the black guides, brought\r\nthem quickly on the route of the fugitives; but the guides soon betrayed\r\nor exhausted this device, and though they continued to leave direction\r\nsticks, they reversed their meaning, and distracted their pursuers.\r\n\r\nThe Tasmanian allies themselves, were exceedingly uncertain, and prone\r\nto escape. They disclosed to their countrymen the plans adopted for\r\ntheir capture, related the expeditions they had witnessed, and added new\r\nexcitements to rage. Sydney natives were obtained, to assist in the\r\ncapture: Pigeon and John Crook, under the care of Mr. Batman, promoted\r\nthe success of the undertaking. Pigeon narrowly escaped being shot: he\r\nwandered from his party, and was seen by a stockman in a tree, who\r\nfired, in spite of his endeavours to explain. Pigeon then slipped down,\r\nand reached his friends, only in time to avoid the second charge of his\r\npertinacious antagonist. The story is worth relating, not on account of\r\nthe actors, but because it displays how cheap, at that hour, was the\r\nlife of a native, although peaceably living in the forests of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAmong those distinguished for the knowledge of the bush, compassion for\r\nthe natives, and skill in pursuing them, Mr. Batman was the subject of\r\nfrequent and approving mention. It is said by Backhouse, that his\r\nparties killed thirty, and captured five. Occasionally, natives were\r\nfound in the neighbourhood of Ben Lomond. In one instance, it is\r\nrecorded, that ten fell, and that two were taken; and in another, that\r\nforty received the fire, and left behind them trails of blood, but no\r\ncaptives. On another, fifteen or sixteen were said to fall, out of a\r\nparty of seventy: three hundred buck shot were poured into an\r\nencampment, at twenty yards distance. It would be endless to recite\r\nconflicts of this kind: they probably were but a multiplication of a\r\nshort bulletin, referring to an expedition--\"_five shot, and one\r\ntaken_.\" Looked at alone, even in the mildest form, these measures are\r\nrevolting; but to Mr. Batman belongs the praise of mingling humanity\r\nwith severity: of perceiving human affections in the creatures he was\r\ncommissioned to resist. His mission cannot be compared with that of his\r\nsuccessor, but he certainly began in the midst of conflict and\r\nbloodshed, to try the softer influences of conciliation and charity. He\r\nreceived a party into his house, endeavoured to win their regard; fed,\r\nclothed, and soothed them; and when some of them disappointed his hopes,\r\nby throwing off their garments and retiring into the bush, he still\r\npersevered in attempting their reclamation.\r\n\r\nBut if the authorised system was attended with a sad sacrifice of native\r\nlife, no one will question the atrocities committed by _commandoes_,\r\nfirst formed by stock-keepers, and some settlers, under the influence of\r\nanger, and then continued from habit. The smoke of a fire was the signal\r\nfor a black hunt. The sportsmen having taken up their positions, perhaps\r\non a precipitous hill, would first discharge their guns, then rush\r\ntowards the fires, and sweep away the whole party. The wounded were\r\nbrained; the infant cast into the flames; the musket was driven into the\r\nquivering flesh; and the social fire, around which the natives gathered\r\nto slumber, became, before morning, their funeral pile.[14]\r\n\r\nA detail of such facts, is in the hand of the writer, the recital of\r\nwhich would disgrace, without improving mankind; and it is rather in\r\ndeference to a general principle than personal considerations, that the\r\ncrimes of amateur assassins are left to oblivion.[15]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: \"Unless the blacks are exterminated, or removed,\r\nconciliation is in vain. Shall the sons of a country give way before the\r\naborigines, _after having repulsed the arms of France_? They are now\r\nshot, with as little remorse as so many crows!!\"--_Col. Advocate_,\r\n1828.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: A party, under Major Grey, went out in pursuit: overtook a\r\nfew blacks; one was seized; but he was so smeared with grease, that he\r\nslipped through the hands of his captors. A paper of the day recommends,\r\nthat the arms of the pursuer be thrust under the arms of the black; and,\r\nthe hands being raised, to be firmly clasped over the back of the\r\nfugitive's neck--an expedient, that reminds us of the salt specific for\r\ncatching birds, with which most children have been delighted and\r\ndisappointed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\nHowever just these representations of individual conduct, and with\r\nwhatever severity the measures of government bore upon the aborigines,\r\nthat unhappy people afforded ample reason for apprehension, and even\r\nabhorrence. Their crimes were fearful, and the effect of their outrage\r\non the colonial mind can only be imagined. The fierce robbers, of\r\nEuropean origin, who had infested the land, were not half so terrible:\r\nthese were at least restrained by early associations and national\r\nsympathies; often by conscience, and even by each other. But the natives\r\nnow united the antipathy of a national foe, and the rapacity of a\r\nbanditti, with the spite of individual revenge: they were at once a\r\npeople in arms, and a distributed band of assassins.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between the local and imperial authorities exhibits\r\nthe feelings of the Governor, and his full consciousness, that however\r\nnecessary his proceedings might seem on the spot, surveyed from the\r\ndistance, they would wear the aspect of cruelty. In 1828, he apprised\r\nLord Goderich, that the proposal to remove the natives from the island,\r\nhad not met his concurrence; and that the commissioners for lands had\r\npointed out the north-east coast as adapted to their wants, well\r\nsheltered and warm, abounding with game, accessible by water, and easy\r\nto guard. It was stated by Colonel Arthur that harsh measures were\r\ndemanded by the colonists; but that he could not dismiss from his\r\nrecollection, that the whites were the aggressors, and that every plan\r\nshould be tried before treating the natives as accredited enemies. Three\r\nmonths after, he forwarded another communication, which referred to the\r\nmurders recently committed, and justified the proclamation which he had\r\nissued for their expulsion. So exasperated were the settlers, that the\r\nsafety of the blacks themselves seemed to demand this precaution. He\r\nhad, however, found it impossible to assign one district, owing to the\r\nanimosities of the tribes against each other, and therefore he resolved\r\nto expel them to the remoter portions of their several territories. In\r\ntwo other communications of the same year, the Governor reported the\r\ntemporary retirement of the natives, in search of marine subsistence,\r\nand their return from their winter quarters in the November following,\r\nwhen their animosity had not abated: a dark catalogue of murders,\r\nincluding every age, condition, and sex, attested their subtlety and\r\nsanguinary spirit. He still declared that no means were neglected to\r\nconciliate and reclaim them, consistent with the interests of the colony\r\nat large; but their indiscriminate attacks were equally directed against\r\ntheir benefactors and their enemies. Communication had become difficult,\r\na risk of life, and almost impossible.\r\n\r\nThese statements are, unhappily, sustained by ample proof. It would be a\r\nwaste of time even to condense, in the most succinct relation, all the\r\nincidents that occurred. Narrative is tedious by the monotony of detail,\r\nand the events themselves were recorded by those who witnessed them,\r\nwith ominous brevity. Such crimes were of daily occurrence; perhaps\r\nsometimes multiplied by rumour, but often unheard of and unrecorded. The\r\nperils of the stockmen were constant: many of them were repeatedly\r\nwounded; and one, named Cubit, was nine times speared, and yet survived.\r\nDeath assumed new forms daily: the poet of the Iliad did not describe\r\nmore numerous varieties, in the slaughter of his heroes.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd went from home in the morning, attended by his dog, and\r\narmed with a gun, now unavailing for his defence: he never returned. Had\r\nhe escaped to the bush? Such a step was improbable. His employers are\r\nsoon informed that the blacks have been near; that the sheep have been\r\nwounded, or beaten to death. The search now becomes diligent: at length,\r\nthe melancholy reality is clear; they find a mutilated form, which still\r\npreserves sufficient proof that the lost shepherd lies there. The sad\r\ncatastrophe excites the compassion of the master; but it provokes the\r\nfellow servants to rage, and they devote themselves to the destruction\r\nof the murderous race.\r\n\r\nThe little child strays outside the cottage of her parent--fresh as the\r\nmorning, and warmed with the hilarity of young life: a shriek is heard\r\nto succeed quickly the loud laugh of pleasure. The mother rushes\r\nforward; sees a black boy fleeing in the distance, and then beholds the\r\nvictim of his malice: she draws forth the spear, and her child is dead.\r\n\r\nThe settler, now grown rich by his flocks and tillage, looks forward to\r\nthe enjoyment of his opulence in domestic happiness. The companion of\r\nhis early labors and privations forms the chief object in the picture;\r\nbut while he was dreaming of future bliss, the envious eye of a savage,\r\nwhich had recognised in that prosperous homestead a station of his\r\nfathers, had glanced over and blighted all.\r\n\r\nThose who were compelled to travel from home, left their families the\r\nprey to inexpressible anxiety. Every moment of delay awakened new\r\nforebodings. Often would the settler see his wife and children, on some\r\nprominent spot, the subjects of fears which required no interpreter,\r\nshading the eyes in the attitude of earnest attention; and when they\r\ncaught the first glimpse of his approach, the rushing together, and\r\nmarks of gratulation, indicated the gladness of watchers, whose painful\r\ntask is done. To appear in safety, was a new though daily deliverance.\r\n\r\nBut if such were the fears at home, the traveller himself was not free\r\nfrom perturbation. He would neglect the common dangers of a rocky\r\ndescent, and \"sidling\" way, to guard against perils far more dreaded: he\r\nwould often pause, to listen; the moving of the leaf, would terrify him.\r\nHe would hear a rush--it was but the cattle: he would gaze steadfastly\r\nat some black substance far off, until convinced that it was the stock\r\nof a tree; then reproaching his fears, he would gallop on rapidly--then\r\nmoving round some overhanging rock, he would see savage faces and poised\r\nspears! Retreat is now impossible: he spurs his horse, which seems\r\nalmost to be conscious of danger, and perhaps reaches his home exhausted\r\nwith fatigue and dread; happy, however, to have been once more\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nNor is it possible to describe the emotions which were wrought up, by\r\nthe consciousness that a feeble woman and helpless children were exposed\r\nto the clubs and spears of the savage. Men know, when they pass their\r\nthreshold, that the ties of life are uncertain, and that desolation may\r\nblast whatever they leave tranquil and beloved; but there was an intense\r\nrealisation of this hazard, in those parts of the colony where\r\nprotection was least accessible.\r\n\r\nDeath, by the hands of a savage, is indeed invested with the darkest\r\nterrors: it was rarely instantaneous--it was often the effect of\r\nprotracted torment, and of repeated blows: often, after a long pursuit,\r\nin which hope might occasionally gleam for a moment, to render death to\r\nthe exhausted fugitive more distinct and terrible; or, perhaps, at once\r\nwounded mortally and prostrate, when the rush of early affections and\r\nlong forgotten truth and brief supplication would come with that swoon,\r\nby which nature sometimes ushers in the fatal moment; the dying man\r\nwould be roused by infernal shouts, and there would swim before him\r\nbrandished clubs, and horrid visages distorted with demoniac rage. Such\r\nwere the recollections of some who recovered; and such, we may be\r\nassured, were the emotions of many that died.\r\n\r\nComparatively, the natives did not frequently injure women and children;\r\npartly, perhaps, that they were less exposed, and partly from natural\r\ncompassion. Thus, when the house of Clarke was destroyed by the Big\r\nRiver tribe, and its owner perished in the flames, the woman with him\r\nescaped with her clothes ignited--ran to the savages, and fell down upon\r\nher knees, imploring their pity. One of their number extinguished the\r\nflames, and bade her be gone. It may be doubted, if this instance of\r\ncompassion always found a parallel in the conduct of the white. About\r\nthe same time, a wretch boasted to Mr. O'Connor, that he had thrown a\r\nnative woman on the fire, and burnt her to death. The equity of\r\nProvidence seems vindicated by the fact, that he perished by the spears\r\nof the race, who watched him continually, until he fell into their\r\npower.\r\n\r\nLong after the pacific mission of Robinson, it was found necessary to\r\nrestrain the wanderings of the women, to prevent their sacrifice to\r\nwhite vengeance. But, on the part of the natives, there were not wanting\r\nfearful examples of implacable and treacherous violence. Such was the\r\nmurder of Mrs. Gough and her children. In 1828, about twenty men,\r\nunattended by their families, had re-appeared in the centre of the\r\nisland, and approached the neighbourhood of Oatlands: they attacked the\r\ncottage of one Moor, as a feint, and thus drew off the husband of the\r\nunfortunate woman, to the assistance of his neighbour. On returning, he\r\nmet his daughter, with the sad intelligence, that children and wife were\r\nmurdered, and that she only had escaped. He found the mother leaning\r\nagainst a fence, covered with blood: \"Dear Gough,\" she said, \"it is all\r\nover with me; the blacks have killed me!\" He endeavoured to staunch her\r\nwounds; then hastened to his children, and found them, not dead, but\r\ndying. The blacks had inflicted reiterated blows, and answered\r\nentreaties with threats of murder. Mrs. Gough was shortly afterwards\r\nlaid beside her children. The attack was more fierce, and yet\r\ndeliberate, than common: but not long before, some stockmen at the Lakes\r\nrequested two women to ascend the trees: while there, they shot them. It\r\nis necessary to add, that the women sometimes approached the huts, as\r\nspies, or such actions would be incredible.\r\n\r\nThe government and the press complained repeatedly, that no regular\r\nresistance was offered to the depredators; that the settlers did not\r\ninstantly pursue, and, by combined efforts, intimidate or destroy them.\r\nIt was said, that they easily forgot the danger, so soon as the blacks\r\nhad withdrawn, and abated even the ordinary vigilance, which such\r\nformidable enemies might inspire. Thus, the slaughter of a shepherd had\r\nbecome too frequent to produce much sensation, and was set down as a\r\ncommon risk of colonial life. When they heard that a servant was\r\nspeared, they would exclaim, \"Ah! is he killed? poor fellow!\"--and\r\nhaving brought in a verdict of wilful murder, they left him to the\r\nforgetfulness of the grave.\r\n\r\nIt was said, that as the passenger approached the towns, he found the\r\nanxiety of the people diminished, and their feeling revolutionised. In\r\nthe interior, the blacks were spoken of with intense fear, and\r\ndetestation: in the capital, even their depredations were questioned,\r\nand the subjects of conversation, were rather their sufferings than\r\ntheir crimes.\r\n\r\nGovernor Arthur strongly censured the negligence of farmers; but this\r\nwas rather to arouse them, than to decide finally the fact, or\r\nculpability of their inaction. In truth, the pursuit of a party of\r\naborigines, was a very hopeless affair: it required a minute\r\npreparation; and to a well fleshed, and not perhaps youthful yeoman, was\r\nattended with vast fatigue, and almost certain failure. An organised\r\nenemy may be found: not so, naked and scattered blacks,\r\nundistinguishable from the trees of the wood; who could crouch in a\r\ngulley--creep almost as rapidly as a dog. The appearance of apathy, in\r\nreality resulted from the uselessness or danger of action; nor can it be\r\na matter of surprise, that men expelled from their minds an evil merely\r\npossible, which they hoped to escape, and which no forethought would\r\navoid. Whether these imputations were just, or not, they were revived in\r\nvarious forms, by the Governor's private and public addresses. They\r\nconstitute a large portion of his correspondence with the Home\r\nGovernment; but they drew forth from the Secretary of State what,\r\nperhaps, was chiefly desired--an approbation of his measures of\r\nprotection; for, however apathetic individuals, it was admitted, that\r\nthe repression of outrage, from whatever cause, and at whatever cost,\r\nwas an obligation on government. There were, nevertheless, several\r\ninstances of courageous defence: large numbers were successfully\r\nresisted by a single musket; and it was stated by Governor Arthur, that\r\ntwo armed men would strike a whole mob with panic--a contempt of their\r\nvalour, which was often provoked by the subtlety of their escape. Such\r\nis commonly the case: savages, even when courageous, are unwilling to\r\nface the deadly weapon of the white man. They, however, lost much of\r\ntheir alarm; and, at length, would pause for the report, and rush on\r\nwith shouts of defiance, when the English had discharged their guns.\r\n\r\nThe most courageous instances of defence, were furnished by females:\r\nthey were sometimes surprised by a visit, when escape was hopeless, and\r\nrelief unattainable. Mrs. Maclanachan maintained a post, purely by her\r\nresolution. Mrs. Dalrymple Brigge, a half-caste woman, was rewarded\r\nwith twenty acres of land, for her heroism. She drew inside her house\r\nher wounded child, barricaded her door, and fired through a crevice. The\r\nblacks attempted, first to pull down her cottage, and then to destroy it\r\nby fire. The conflict lasted more than an hour, when relief came.\r\nAnother: Mrs. Connel defended her house with the musket; a little child,\r\nof four years, bringing one to her as she fired off another: she was\r\nwithin a few days of her confinement. The fortitude displayed, on these\r\noccasions, was very justly admired: we cannot, however, but be sensible,\r\nthat few possessed either the physical strength, or the knowledge of\r\narms, equal to a task so hard.\r\n\r\nIn this colony, 1830 will be ever memorable, as the year of the Black\r\nWar--that campaign, which formed the first military lesson given to the\r\ncolonists. In the ferment of the public mind, innumerable plans were\r\npropounded for their capture: some merit remembrance from their oddity,\r\nand some for their kindness. It was suggested, that those natives in\r\ncustody should be driven forward, secured by a tether, and thus\r\ncompelled to guide the pursuit. It was also proposed, that depots of\r\nflour, sugar, and other tempting articles of food should be placed in\r\nthe tracks, and when natives were engaged in seizing the prize, the\r\nPhilistines would be upon them. A third plan recommended, that four or\r\nfive persons should be placed in the vicinity of huts, to be erected for\r\nthe purpose: they were to stand outside, and allure the natives; and\r\nwhen seen by them, to feign alarm, and run. The natives, it was\r\nexpected, would make for the seemingly abandoned dwellings, to be\r\nsurprised by the English, lying in ambush. Their dogs often gave them\r\nnotice of approach: a scheme was propounded, to turn this advantage\r\nagainst them. The English were to be furnished with two sets of dogs:\r\none leash, swift and fierce, to pursue the dogs of the natives; but as\r\nboth would soon vanish from the sight of the pursuers, the second\r\nspecies were to be retained, to scent their course. Thus, the native\r\nwould run first,--his dogs after him; then would come the large dogs of\r\nthe English--then their little dogs; and, finally, the captors! An old\r\nmariner, who had witnessed the effect of music in taming savage tribes,\r\nproposed to try the persuasion of sweet sounds. He was not aware, that\r\nthe expedient had been in vain tested under happier auspices; even had\r\nit been possible for a military band to career along with the requisite\r\nspeed. The musician of the _Recherche_ carried his instrument on shore,\r\nand played his sweetest melodies: the natives took no notice. Unwilling\r\nto doubt the efficacy of his art, on his next visit he used sharper\r\ntones and quicker measures: the aborigines put their fingers to their\r\nears, and the Frenchman dropped his fiddle in despair.\r\n\r\nIt will be proper briefly to notice the state of the public mind at the\r\nmoment. The natives were now a mere handful: an irregular contest of\r\nseveral years duration, now and then slackened, was ever adding some new\r\nvictim to the slain. The constables occasionally fell in with the\r\ntemporary huts, which told the mournful tale of rapid depopulation. In\r\ntracks, where thirty or forty huts had, in former years, indicated a\r\nconsiderable clan, four or five only were reared; but while the natives\r\ndiminished, they seemed to increase their activity, moving to various\r\nplaces with almost incredible swiftness. It is said, that they would\r\ntravel fifty miles in a day. Their superior knowledge of the country\r\nenabled them to reach stations more remote in appearance than reality. A\r\ncolonist, of the present time, by better acquaintance with the road, can\r\npass in a few hours to places, once several days journey distant. Such\r\nrapid progress may perhaps be doubted, but it was sufficient to give\r\nthem the appearance of ubiquity; and since they now were no longer\r\ncasual but habitual robbers, the havoc and alarm they created had rather\r\naugmented, as their numbers declined. The colony, then prosperous in its\r\ngeneral affairs, was deeply depressed by their continued outrages:\r\nshepherds would no longer tend their flocks, unless accompanied by armed\r\ncompanions. On the slightest signal of the approaching foe, they would\r\nflee with precipitation: ten times a day the quiet of domestic life\r\nwould be broken by the fears, feigned or real, of the workmen. If they\r\nidled on the road, it was the blacks that retarded them: if they lost\r\nprovisions, the hut had been robbed by the blacks. Often, too, these\r\nvexations were tinged with the ludicrous: the rumour would reach the\r\ntownship that an unfortunate had been speared, who, when more closely\r\nexamined, was found dead drunk. Some imaginative settler would return,\r\nwith the sure information that the blacks were lurking in the woods: the\r\ncautious whites, well armed and skilfully disposed, would march round\r\nthe hiding place, and stealthily approach a stump of more than usual\r\nlikeness to animated nature.\r\n\r\nAn officer, newly arrived, when the depredations were most alarming and\r\nfrequent, looked from the window of his cottage, in the twilight, and\r\ndiscerned many blacks crouching among the stubble of a corn field\r\nlately reaped. He hastened and ordered out his men: they cautiously\r\ncrept round the inclosure, and were gratified as they drew nigh to\r\ndiscover that the enemy had not moved. Another small party of soldiers\r\nobserved a body of fifty or sixty, on the borders of a creek, flowing\r\ninto Oyster Bay: as they were approached by the British, they made for a\r\npoint of land. It was, apparently, a certain capture: the soldiers and\r\nconstables rushed on, when the foe took the water. In these adversaries\r\nthe colonist will recognise the black stumps, left by imperfect farming,\r\nand the black swans which adorn our waters. Notice was brought, that\r\nsome one in the far interior was killed: the coroner's jury was\r\nsummoned; the verdict was, of necessity, \"_not yet dead_.\"[16]\r\n\r\nThe disquietude occasioned by an enemy, so insignificant; the constant\r\nvigilance imposed, and the not infrequent heavy calamities inflicted,\r\nare events justly exhibited by the _Aborigines' Committee_, as a lesson\r\nto mankind. The long oppression of a race, not prone to violence, was\r\nnow productive of its fruit, and exacted from the colonists a fearful\r\nretribution.\r\n\r\nThe most alarming movement of the natives was, the systematic\r\ndestruction of premises by fire. This was revenge within their reach, at\r\nany hour; and its previous infrequency is a matter of astonishment. In\r\nthree months, the huts of Messrs. Howel, Sherwin, and Clarke, had been\r\ndestroyed. The property of Mr. Sherwin, lying between hills, was easily\r\nwatched, and spies were posted on the heights. The mode of firing the\r\npremises was deliberate: they kindled the flames at twenty yards apart,\r\nso that the whole was simultaneously burned; this done, they went off,\r\nshouting and crying out to the English to go away. The extent of the\r\nmischief was not so alarming as its forebodings. That element, which\r\nnature has placed at man's disposal, and can be turned, by a moment's\r\neffort to the destruction of a fortune, might long have proved an\r\neffectual scourge, and made colonisation hopeless. The retention of\r\nproperties, as well as the security of dependents, required decided and\r\nunanimous measures.\r\n\r\nNo part of Governor Arthur's character conciliates greater esteem, than\r\nhis promptitude to encourage humanity in the whites, and to win the\r\nconfidence of the natives. At the commencement of this year, he offered\r\na liberal reward to any one who should open a pacific communication, or\r\nif a convict free pardon. He promised five pounds for every adult, and\r\ntwo pounds for every child, taken alive. He entreated the colonists to\r\nenjoin the utmost tenderness on their servants, and invariably to spare\r\nthe women and children. These merciful intentions were but little\r\nsuccessful: the rewards were rarely claimed. But no effort, in a right\r\ndirection, is ever lost: the conduct of John Benfield, a convict, was\r\ndistinguished for intrepidity and coolness in a capture, and Colonel\r\nArthur bestowed warm praise. Observing a fire, at a short distance, he\r\napproached three aborigines, to whom he offered bread: one of them\r\npromised to accompany him, if he would put aside his gun; this risk he\r\nincurred. He led the black to his hut, and gave him food and blankets\r\nfor his companions; and soon succeeded in completely conciliating them\r\nall. They joined him in hunting the opossum: thus he drew them on to the\r\nmilitary party stationed at Captain Moriarty's. This man certainly\r\ndeserved the reward he obtained, and the government notice of an action\r\nso courageous and humane, must have mitigated the fierce spirit of his\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe orders and notices issued by the Governor during this year,\r\nrepresent the powerful agitation of the public mind, and from which he\r\nhimself was by no means free. Sometimes, the hope of reconciliation\r\nseemed strong; thus, August 19th, he states that Captain Welch and Mr.\r\nG. A. Robinson had obtained a friendly parley with a hostile tribe. It\r\nwas ordered, that no attempt should be made to capture or restrain such\r\naborigines as might approach the settlement; but that, after supplying\r\nthem with food, they should be suffered to depart.\r\n\r\nHe found it necessary to explain the conditions on which rewards were\r\noffered for capture, which had been abused, by the violent detention of\r\ninoffensive natives: those who, in attempting to arrest them, were\r\nguilty of wanton mischief, were threatened with the penalties of the\r\nlaw. These orders were followed by outrages, which threw doubt on the\r\npropriety of distinctions: the ally of to-day, was the robber of\r\nyesterday, and the assassin of the morrow. The natives of the south-west\r\ndistricts of the colony, and of the islands, were still exempted from\r\nproscription; but an explanatory notice, authorised the settlers, by\r\nwhatever necessary means, to anticipate, or repel, the barbarous\r\nattacks, now renewed with terrible frequency and atrocity.\r\n\r\nThese public instructions indicate the alternate feelings which\r\nprevailed: they were natural to men who, reflecting on the origin of the\r\nwarfare, felt that measures, now indispensable, were not wholly\r\nguiltless.\r\n\r\n                   *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n     OFFICIAL LIST OF ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY THE NATIVES.\r\n\r\n     1830.--January 1.

They took away blankets, shirts,\r\n     sheets, knives, 600 or 700 lbs. of flour (which they tied up), half\r\n     a basket of tobacco, 100 lbs. of sugar, a bag of tea, and a\r\n     considerable quantity of slop clothing: so great ingenuity was\r\n     displayed in the attack, that for some time it was supposed that\r\n     Europeans had conducted it. On the same day, the natives plundered\r\n     a hut, opposite to Mr. Scott's, of all the tea, sugar, flour, and\r\n     bedding, that were in it.\r\n\r\n     October 16th.

Thomas, Esq., and his overseer, Mr. Parker,\r\n     murdered near Port Sorell, by a mob of natives, whilst, actuated by\r\n     the most humane views, they were endeavouring to carry the\r\n     conciliatory measures of government into effect. Mr. Thomas had\r\n     received ten spear wounds, and Mr. Parker eleven. Stocker's hut\r\n     desperately attacked; a child wounded; a man, named Cubit, speared.\r\n     22nd.

When they saw the natives, these armed murderers galloped after\r\nthem, and delivered their fire without danger to themselves.\r\n\r\nAn estate is called \"_Quambys_:\" the name is a cry of distress and\r\nentreaty, and signifies, _spare me!_. It was uttered by a black, who was\r\nfound there, when imploring compassion; as the supplication is\r\nremembered, perhaps not then in vain: but mercy was rarely shown. A\r\nvolunteer party discovered a tribe in a valley, surrounded by steep\r\nmountains; from the heights they poured down a volley of musketry, and\r\nthen heaped the slain on the ashes of their fires. Another party\r\novertook a tribe who had displayed a hostile spirit: they were on the\r\nbanks of a lagoon, and all around were plains; escape was hopeless. They\r\nrushed into the water; as their heads rose above the surface, they were\r\nshot. These are specimens which rest on authority not to be disputed.\r\n\r\nThe slaughter of thirty aborigines, in 1838, at a remote station in New\r\nHolland, instanced the cool deliberation with which they were too often\r\nsacrificed. The deed was planned several days before, and the leisure of\r\nthe sabbath was employed for its perpetration. The seven murderers had\r\nbeen all prisoners of the crown: a subscription was made for their\r\ndefence; but in spite of strong sympathy in their behalf, they were\r\nsentenced to death, and ultimately executed. There had been no\r\nprovocation: being on horseback, they surrounded the natives, who were\r\nreposing beside their evening fires. These ran to the hut of one of the\r\nassassins, with whom they had lived on terms of amity. There they were\r\nbound, and, amidst their groans, cries, and tears--men, and women with\r\nchildren at the breast--they were led off to a spot selected for the\r\nimmolation. Great pains were taken to conceal the crime; but through a\r\nfall of rain the day preceding, their tracks were visible, and birds of\r\nprey attracted attention to the slaughter! The strongest suspicion\r\nexisted, that the murderers were the miserable agents of persons still\r\nmore guilty.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: The Aborigines' Committee observed, \"that an opinion was\r\ngaining ground in the colony, that small parties should be formed by the\r\nsettlers, for the extirpation of the blacks; an idea, which they\r\ncontemplated with horror.\" It was more than an opinion--it was a\r\nterrible reality.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Hobart Town Courier._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.\r\n\r\nEfforts of conciliation, were made through the medium of three women,\r\ncaptured by the police; and who, after being treated with kindness, were\r\npermitted to return to their tribe, and to invite their submission. One\r\nof these was seen in the journey, and slain, in error! After the absence\r\nof a few weeks, the survivors prevailed on the chief, and nine other men\r\nof the tribe, to accompany them to the residence of Mr. Batman: this\r\ngentleman, and his family, assiduously cultivated their good will, being\r\none of the few who entertained a strong confidence in the power of\r\nkindness; notwithstanding, after remaining nine days, they eloped, it is\r\nsaid laden with plunder--displaying, in their progress, unmitigated\r\nhostility. Two natives, who delivered themselves up to a shepherd, and\r\nwere lodged in the penitentiary at Launceston, after being supplied with\r\nabundance of food and clothing, within a month effected their escape,\r\nand were traced by their outrages. The celebrated chief, Eumarrah,\r\ncaptured by Robertson, after two years detention, when his artless\r\nmanner and apparent reconciliation to his lot, threw his keepers off\r\ntheir guard, contrived to abscond. Justice is, however, due to the\r\nreputation of a savage. Eumarrah, afterwards complained, that when\r\nemployed on the LINE, he was beaten by a constable: Jemmy, who escaped\r\nat the same time, had been chained to a bench all night, by a similar\r\nfunctionary. The newspapers of the day complain, that in gaol food\r\nsufficient for their appetites had not been always supplied them. The\r\nwomen were declining in health, when allowed their liberty. This last,\r\nwas the great cause of their restlessness; they felt the oppression of\r\ncivilisation; they were weary of clothing; the skin was irritated. The\r\ninstinct which prompts a bird to seek some way of exit, also moves a\r\nsavage: it was not so much indifference to kindness, as the passion for\r\nroaming--the habit of the race. Nor were they managed always with\r\nprudence: they were left to the mischievous influence of low white men,\r\nwho delighted to terrify, even when they did not positively injure them.\r\nIt was not until thirty had escaped, nearly equal to the whole number\r\ntaken, that it was discovered, that to retain them, even their\r\nprejudices required tenderness, and that they were deeply sensible of\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nThese retreats tended to extinguish the hopes cherished by the friends\r\nof the natives, and rooted the conviction more firmly in the colonial\r\nmind, that all efforts to tame them were unavailing. All the plans laid\r\ndown for their expulsion, had been tried, and had proved to be\r\nimpracticable. They still recurred to their usual haunts, and made up\r\nfor their diminished numbers by their improved method, cunning, and\r\naudacity. Having committed depredations, they retired, with their\r\nplunder, to the districts reserved for their occupation, and whither it\r\nwas unlawful to follow them, except for sworn offences. The Governor\r\ndetermined to try a movement, _en masse_, and by the united force of the\r\nentire population, to drive the Austral tribes within Tasman's\r\nPeninsula--a territory, joined to the main land by a neck, about one\r\nquarter of a mile in breadth. The success of this plan could never have\r\nbeen considered very promising. The Governor expressed his doubt\r\nrespecting the result, while it was in progress; and there is no reason\r\nto question that, in putting it to the test, he was moved by the earnest\r\nentreaties of the colonists, and a conviction that nothing should be\r\nleft untried, to preserve the people committed to his charge.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th September, 1830, the intention of the Governor was officially\r\nannounced. Referring to the outrages of the natives, he asserted that\r\ntheir expulsion was impossible, but by a simultaneous effort. He called\r\non every settler, whether residing in the town or country, to place\r\nhimself under the direction of a magistrate, whoever he might prefer;\r\nthat the whole military and police strength, combined with such\r\nassistance, might capture the hostile tribes, or permanently expel them.\r\nThe solemnity of the engagement, no less than the preservation of the\r\nlives and property of the whole community, would require a serious and\r\nresolute co-operation. On former occasions, he observed such campaigns\r\nhad been greatly perverted, and transformed into amusement and\r\nrecreation. The Governor gave no promise of recompense, and insisted\r\nthat the effort, however meritorious, was simply the duty of all; but\r\nwith his accustomed tact, he chose this moment to reward, with large\r\ngrants of land, those persons already distinguished for enterprise and\r\nsuccess, and to distribute indulgences to prisoners who had been\r\nactively employed in the service. Mr. Batman, who had devoted twelve\r\nmonths to the pursuit of the blacks, obtained 2,000 acres of land. Mr.\r\nHowel, of the Clyde, whose losses had been great, but who was\r\nrepresented as displaying an untiring spirit of humanity, was consoled\r\nwith 1,000 acres. The aboriginal Sydney guides, and Black Bill, a\r\nTasmanian, received each 100 acres.\r\n\r\nThe volunteer parties from Hobart Town, were to join the force at New\r\nNorfolk, the Clyde, or Richmond: those from Launceston, were to patrol\r\nthe westward and Norfolk Plains, the west bank of the Tamar, or the\r\ncountry extending from Ben Lomond to George Town. Enterprising young\r\nmen, inured to the bush, were requested to attach themselves to the\r\nsmall military parties at the out stations, and, under military\r\nofficers, to scour the northern country.\r\n\r\nMen, holding tickets-of-leave, were required to enrol under the\r\nmagistrate of their district, and settlers were enjoined to equip and\r\ndetach whatever servants they could spare, reserving only sufficient\r\nstrength for the protection of their families. The inhabitants of Hobart\r\nTown, in public meeting assembled, tendered their service to the\r\ngovernment, for the furtherance of the object. The peace-loving Joseph\r\nHone, Esq., was chairman of this warlike meeting: most of the leading\r\nspeakers belonged to the profession of the gown. Mr. Kemp, one of the\r\nelder colonists, once an officer of the 102nd regiment, who had seen the\r\nprocess of extermination throughout, declared that the English were\r\nchiefly the agressors. Dr. Turnbull contrasted the effects of a vigorous\r\nresistance by government and the conflict of individuals: united effort\r\nmight be followed by bloodshed, but would tend to repress the habits of\r\nviolence, and, at least, save a remnant from destruction. A tribe, one\r\nhundred and sixty strong four years before, that frequented the\r\nElizabeth River, was reduced to sixty by daily skirmishes with the\r\nstock-keepers. A question, however, arose, whether it were lawful to\r\nshoot aborigines refusing to surrender on challenge. Against this\r\nconstruction of law, Mr. Gellibrand earnestly protested; and\r\nmaintained, in warm terms, their claims to sympathy and\r\ncompassion--himself, alas! destined to die by the hands of the race. It\r\nseemed, however, generally understood, that capture should be attempted\r\nby the most merciful methods, but accomplished at all events.\r\nColonisation by the French, was exhibited by Mr. Hackett, the distiller,\r\nin contrast with English; but Dr. Ross rose in reply, and stated that\r\nthere was a rock which bore the name of _The Leap_, from which the last\r\nsixty natives of Grenada were precipitated. Mr. R. L. Murray treated the\r\nprevailing notion of danger with derision: three women, he said, would\r\nput a whole tribe to flight; but Mr. Home reminded the meeting, that the\r\ngrass had not yet covered the graves of a mother and her children,\r\nrecently slain. Thus, like the warriors of the heroic age, they debated\r\nbefore they armed; but it is difficult to reconcile the civic temper\r\nwith military subordination: the committee nominated by the meeting to\r\nenrol the town guard, suggested that volunteers should be allowed to\r\nchoose each their own company, as well as their own officers. One party\r\nof twenty-four, required the choice of their post, and the right to act\r\nas an independent division.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd September, the plan of the campaign was minutely described\r\nin a government order, and operations were fixed for the 7th of October.\r\nIts main features may be briefly stated:--The Oyster Bay and Big River\r\ntribes, as the most sanguinary, were first marked out for pursuit. They\r\nwere to be driven within the county of Buckingham; the utmost care being\r\nemployed to prevent escape through the lines, while chasing them to\r\nTasman's Peninsula.\r\n\r\nA chain of posts was occupied, under Captain Welman, from St. Patrick's\r\nHead on the east coast; including the source of St. Paul's River, and\r\nstretching to Campbell Town. A second chain, under Major Douglas,\r\nextending from Campbell Town, passed south of the Macquarie, to its\r\njunction with the Lake River. Both divisions, marching in a southerly\r\ndirection, formed a line from Oyster Bay tier to Lackey's Mills. During\r\nthese manoeuvres, a party were sent to examine the tier, extending\r\nfrom Swan River to Spring Bay; carefully, however, concealing the\r\nmovement from the natives, lest they should be deterred from passing the\r\nsubjacent isthmus. Other parties were employed, under Captain Wentworth,\r\nto force the aborigines from the neighbourhood of the lakes in the west,\r\ntowards the same centre, advancing due east to the Jordan. The lines\r\nbeing compressed and thickened, and joined by the settlers on their\r\nmarch, were then moved forward, followed by scouring parties, to guard\r\nagainst their escape, should the natives cross the line. Fires were kept\r\nburning to direct the troops, who were expected to march in unbroken\r\norder.\r\n\r\nCaptain Donaldson, who directed the operations in the north of the\r\nisland, swept over the vast extent of country from Norfolk Plains to the\r\nOuse--from Sorell Lake to Lake Echo. There he remained, closing the\r\navenues of escape, while Douglass and Wentworth advanced to their last\r\nposition: he then joined the main body. Twenty-two parties, under Major\r\nDouglas, and fifteen under Captain Wentworth, were then sent within the\r\nlines, to catch the natives, or drive them toward Tasman's Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of provisions to this force, was entrusted to Messrs.\r\nScott, Wedge, and Sharland, surveyors. The rations were delivered to the\r\nleader of each party weekly, and consisted of sugar, tea, flour, and\r\nmeat, in considerable proportions. The principle depot was at Oatlands:\r\nwhere 1,000 muskets were provided, 30,000 rounds blank cartridges, 300\r\npairs of handcuffs, and whatever might contribute to the success of the\r\nassailants. Many thousands of rations were stored, and the settlers saw,\r\nwith pleasure, their produce rise in the neighbourhood of this\r\nformidable band, to twice its recent value. L2,000 was paid to one\r\nmerchant for the tobacco. The officers, to avoid its destruction,\r\ninevitable on so long a march, mostly threw off their military clothing,\r\nand assumed an uniform of Maria Island cloth, thus reserving their full\r\ndress to celebrate the coming triumph. The enthusiasm was universal: a\r\nblacksmith, at Sorell, unable to follow the army, offered to repair all\r\nthe guns belonging to the volunteers of his district. His example was\r\nfollowed by another, who, having but one leg, contributed the same\r\nservice to the common cause. Nor was supplication forgotten: a form of\r\nprayer was composed for those who used formulas, and extempore petitions\r\nwere offered by other denominations. The colony, at large, cheerfully\r\nresponded to the call of government: the military character of the plan\r\nexcited the young, without much alarming the mature. The inhabitants of\r\nthe towns readily enrolled, and the discussions every where exhibited a\r\ncurious mixture of martial ardour and civil pertinacity.\r\n\r\nThere were many old soldiers in the colony, who were amused, without\r\nbeing repelled by this mimicry of war. More busy civilians, were\r\nanxious for the formality of incorporation, and the gradations of\r\ncommand. The townspeople were allowed their choice, between more active\r\nservice and garrison duties. \"Gentlemen,\" said an old soldier, \"you may\r\ncall yourselves marshals, generals, and colonels, but the duties\r\nassigned you are usually performed by a corporal's guard.\" It is\r\ngratifying to observe, that the last injunction of the Governor, and the\r\nlast lesson of the press, suggested humanity. Under the excitement of\r\nlosses and bereavement, the destruction of the natives had been invoked;\r\nbut now, softened by the belief that the whites were about to complete a\r\nwork which had been twenty-six years in progress, and to expatriate the\r\nrace, with one voice all said, \"spare them!\"\r\n\r\nThe forces, including the military and constabulary, amounted to nearly\r\nfive thousand; of these, 1,500 were contributed by Hobart Town, and 500\r\nby Launceston. No army ever departed from their homes less agitated by\r\nthe uncertainties of the future; and notwithstanding the dreary picture\r\nof the service, drawn by the colonel commanding, there was no danger\r\nthat a bridge of Lodi, or a plain of Waterloo, would be found in the\r\ncampaign. Some went out with the keenness of sportsmen who might at\r\nleast catch a kangaroo: others were contented to live moderately well at\r\ngovernment charge. The clerks, released from their offices, gladly\r\nembraced a holiday: the poor prisoner acted and felt as a free man, and\r\nrejoiced in the interval of his servitude; and keen and canny volunteers\r\nembraced the opportunity to range the unknown territory, for the\r\ndiscovery of some neglected spot, which might offer a future home.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of October, the whole country was declared under martial law;\r\nexcepting, however, from its operation, not only the British, but such\r\nof the aborigines as were pacific. This measure was of no great moment,\r\nexcept that it authorised the pursuit of all natives in every quarter.\r\n\r\nThe journals not favorable to the scheme, predicted its failure. There\r\nwere vast probabilities against it: the nature of the force--the seat of\r\nwar--the foe--the discipline--even the orders not to kill, were all\r\npeculiar and discouraging. Townsmen, little accustomed to fatigue, and\r\nsportsmen not disposed to be silent, were to move sometimes in a regular\r\nand quiet line. A shot carelessly fired, the momentary slumber of an\r\nundisciplined sentinel, or the lazy evasion of a scout, might disconcert\r\nthe whole campaign. No Englishman could follow up the native: the array,\r\nthe number and the glancing of muskets, gave warning from afar. An\r\nEuropean, encumbered with his dress, could only move slowly, and when\r\npassing the bush must pause every moment, or be tortured at every step;\r\nbut the native could swing from bough to bough, mount to the topmast\r\nbranch like an opossum, move past the people seeking him diligently, or\r\nlie down until they were gone. To many of the colonists, the campaign\r\nwas no child's play. The pursuit of solitary white or black rangers of\r\nthe wood, was exhilarating to men of great animal courage, and who could\r\nenjoy long intervals of rest; but a regular march, through such a\r\ncountry, soon wore out the patience of many, and they were glad to\r\nresign the glorious undertaking to more ardent warriors.\r\n\r\nAs the campaign advanced, the weather was unpropitious: crossing the\r\nrivers became dangerous; trees had to be cut down to form temporary\r\nbridges. These obstacles cooled the spirit of volunteers, who passed\r\nrapidly from discontent to criticism, and from criticism to despair.\r\n\"Many crawled home:\" such was the indignant description of their\r\nretreat, given by their comrades; and whilst the drenched, but\r\ndecreasing forces lay along the line, young men, it was said, crowded\r\nthe streets of the capital, ignobly forgetful of the common cause.\r\n\r\nParties were divided into threes, each forming a night watch: fires were\r\nlighted for the night, and illumined the whole distance of thirty miles,\r\nfrom Prosser's River to Sorell; and sentinels paced within hail of each\r\nother. The police magistrates visited the several posts on horseback,\r\nand the Governor rode rapidly along the line, from the Clyde to Spring\r\nBay. Dr. Ross recording his Excellency's exertions, states, that to\r\nallow them a full description, would leave no room for any other topic!\r\nHis labours and perils were the theme of admiration and sympathy: it was\r\nreported, that he was lost three days in Paradise--a place renowned for\r\nits miserable vegetation, and the dreariness of its scenery. The warlike\r\ntone of the day may excite a smile, but the fatigue was indisputable;\r\nand although the slipperiness of the foe gave the air of mock heroism to\r\nthe service, the watchers of the line were reminded, by frequent tidings\r\nfrom homeward, that their enemy was strong enough to deal death to the\r\naged and the innocent. Four blacks, who crossed the line, and hung upon\r\nits rear, inflicted terrible vengeance. One attacked a settler, who\r\nreturned a mortal wound with a pitchfork. The survivors hovered about\r\nthe place to avenge his death: they at length found a victim in an\r\namiable young lady, Miss Peters; who was speared in the breast. She\r\nfelt, from the first, that the wound was mortal, and calmly resigned\r\nherself to her destiny. Others, left by their friends and dependants,\r\nwere liable to the same perils: of this, Mr. Gildas, a settler on the\r\nTamar, was a remarkable instance: he had sent his men to the line, and\r\nwas thus alone. He left his house to seek for fire-wood, and was\r\nspeared. The savages plundered his house, and defaced the pictures on\r\nthe walls. A pilot, calling at his dwelling, found it pillaged and\r\ndesolate. This man was at the battle of Trafalgar, and present when\r\nNelson fell--himself reserved to perish in Tasmania, by savage hands.\r\n\r\nThe division under Captain Donaldson, which followed up the main body of\r\nthe forces, arrived on the 31st of October. Colonel Arthur issued from\r\nthe camp (Sorell Rivulet), a statement that the final decisive movement\r\nwas at hand, and that those who had been exposed to great privations,\r\nwould soon be released to their homes. Having been compelled to await\r\nreinforcements, the campaign had been unavoidably prolonged: to have\r\nmoved without them, would have risked the success of the enterprise; the\r\ntwo dangerous tribes would attempt to escape, and the forces in charge\r\nwere exhorted to redouble their vigilance, to prevent their breaking\r\nthrough the position.\r\n\r\nThese notices indicate a confidence of success, doomed to\r\ndisappointment. To the precipitation of Mr. Walpole's party, Colonel\r\nArthur attributed the failure of the expedition. They were instructed\r\nnot to attempt a capture, unless a considerable number could be taken;\r\nbut the sight of the slumbering enemy probably suspended the\r\nrecollection of this order, and was one of those casualties which could\r\nhardly be avoided, in such a wide distribution of command. It was on the\r\n22nd of October this misfortune happened: the natives were discovered\r\nhunting, and were watched, until their evening fires were formed for the\r\nnight. No noise being heard, Mr. Walpole supposed they had taken an\r\nalarm, and advanced at twilight towards the first hut, where he saw five\r\nblacks, with their dogs, fast asleep. He seized one man by the feet, and\r\nafter a severe struggle detained him: a boy, ornamented with figures on\r\nhis body, about fifteen years of age, shared the same lot; but two\r\nothers were shot: the remainder fled. The quantity of spears and baskets\r\nleft behind, proved that their flight was sudden, and their numbers\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made by the natives to cross the line on the 27th\r\nOctober. The sentry had set down his piece, and was putting some wood\r\non the fire, when a spear was thrown at him: he threw the billet in his\r\nhand, and was reaching his musket when he received another spear; an\r\nalarm being given to an adjoining party, the blacks were driven back, of\r\nwhom, however, six only were seen.\r\n\r\nA circumstance occurred, which strongly confirmed the impression, that\r\nsome treacherous whites had directed the natives. In pursuing them as\r\nfar as the isthmus, they discovered in their tracks the impression of\r\nshoe-nails, and other evidence of the presence of white men. The reports\r\nwere soon spread, that the Oyster Bay and Big River tribes were in the\r\nrear. The hopes of the colony rapidly gave way, and the Governor,\r\nwriting to the Secretary of State, on the 21st of November, intimated\r\nhis suspicion that the movement would be in vain.\r\n\r\nThese reports were, indeed, constantly circulated, and tended to damp\r\nthe ardour and diminish the vigilance of the line. Some scouring parties\r\nfrom Norfolk Plains fell in with a tribe of forty, whom they pursued\r\nbeyond the Shannon. They followed them for three days, but were\r\ncompelled to return: the blacks, in their progress, had surprised a\r\nsettler, and murdered him. The rumours of escape were aggravated by\r\nimagination: a party of the whites were seen by some sawyers, who ran\r\naway and reported them as natives; and it was several days before they\r\ncould be persuaded of their error.\r\n\r\nThe settlers, worn out with fatigue and longing for their homes, were\r\nimpatient to advance, and afforded ample opportunities for concealment\r\nand escape. Among the rest a place is noticed, which enabled the natives\r\nto defy intrusion or discovery, near the \"Three Thumbs' Mountain,\"--an\r\nalmost impenetrable forest, of seven miles extent: the spreading\r\nbranches obscure the sky, and lofty plants grow entwined, and conceal an\r\nobject at the distance of a few feet. The attempt of the blacks to cross\r\nthe line discovered their retreat. It was resolved to assemble forces\r\nsufficient to surround, break through, and storm this thicket: it was\r\npenetrated by about 300 men, who kept up a constant fire of musketry. A\r\nparty, hearing the rustling of leaves like the noise of cattle, followed\r\nthe sound: they came up to an encampment, where the fires were\r\nunextinguished, and where half-formed weapons indicated a hasty\r\ndispersion. Here they found the impression of nails, and what were\r\ndeemed sure proofs of a superior directing intelligence. The\r\npresumption, that some convicts were incorporated with the blacks, was\r\ncertainly strong, but it was probably but a temporary or casual\r\nintercourse, of not much utility to the natives. The Governor had,\r\nhowever, a full conviction that to this circumstance the failure might\r\nbe partly ascribed. In the middle of the march, he ordered the\r\npublication of a report, which appeared decisive of the fact. Savage, a\r\nservant of Mr. Bisdee, was met half naked by the Governor, near Mills'\r\nLagoon, to whom he stated he had been surrounded by a tribe, and rescued\r\nfrom violence by a man named Brown, who was with them. This person he\r\nhad known in gaol. Savage advised Brown to bring in the natives, but he\r\nrefused: he said that he had been frequently at Hobart Town, where he\r\nhad bought clothes for the women: he had a double-barrelled gun, and\r\nseemed to have complete control over them. They carried Savage with them\r\nas far as Mills' Lagoon, when he was told he might go. The Governor and\r\nhis party instantly set off in the pursuit, but they discovered no\r\ntraces of the natives. The truth of this narrative has been questioned,\r\nyet from the number of points in which a correct memory, or\r\nextraordinary powers of invention would be requisite, the Governor might\r\nhave easily detected imposition. The man stated that fright cured him of\r\nrheumatism; his rags were consistent with his story. It is, however, the\r\nonly clear testimony to the presence of white men with the blacks at\r\nthat period.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of November, it was announced by the Governor, that the\r\nfirst series of operations was brought to a close; and except a few,\r\nrequisite to protect the country, the colonists and their servants were\r\nreleased, and the town guards replaced.[17]\r\n\r\nThose who had condemned the plan, now censured its precipitate\r\nabandonment: they said that hundreds of blacks were enclosed when the\r\ntroops were withdrawn. It is not likely, however, that the Governor was\r\ndeceived on this point. It is certain that many blacks were in the rear,\r\nand the dispersion of the force was equal to a confession, that the\r\nobject was impracticable--that it had failed.\r\n\r\nThus closed the Black War. This campaign of a month, supplied many\r\nadventures, and many an amusing tale; and, notwithstanding the gravity\r\nof his Excellency, much fun and folly. The settler soldiers returned\r\nto their homes, their shoes worn out, their garments tattered, their\r\nhair long and shaggy, with beards unshaven, their arms tarnished;\r\nbut neither blood-stained nor disgraced. They had seen much and dreaded\r\nmore; but, in general, they met no other enemies than scrub and thorns,\r\nand they sat down on their own hearths, happy in having escaped the\r\nramrods of their friends. The odd tactics, awkward movements--the\r\nskulking and the foraging, and all the various small accomplishments of\r\na bivouac, were long topics of conversation and laughter. The accidents\r\nwere few, though of these some were fatal: two aborigines only were\r\ncaptured, and one soldier was wounded. Yet though not very glorious,\r\nperhaps no evening in the year passes, but some settler's fireside is\r\nenlivened by a story of the fatigues and frolics of the Black War.\r\n\r\nWhen the last movement was completing, the _Science_ sailed for England\r\nwith despatches from Colonel Arthur: they indicate his expectation of a\r\nfailure, and scarcely conceal his mortification. Either the original\r\nimpossibility of the plan, or the indolence or incaution of those who\r\ncarried it out, had exposed the government to more than ridicule. Five\r\nthousand men had taken the field, beside the town guard. Nearly L30,000\r\nhad been expended, and probably not much less value in time and outlay\r\nby the settlers, and two persons only were captured! Those who\r\nprophecied the result, of course exulted in their sagacity: for the\r\nrest, they either praised the motive or the details. An impartial\r\nretrospect will not permit a commendation of the plan. The arrangements\r\nwere ably made, and the parties, though they encountered difficulties\r\nunusual, reached the appointed places with considerable precision.\r\n\r\nA public meeting was called to thank the Governor for his exertions in\r\nthe field. This assembly was summoned, says the chronicler of the times,\r\nby the largest placard ever published in the colony! The resolutions and\r\naddresses were nearly unanimous; Mr. Gregson being almost singly opposed\r\nto this tribute of gratitude. It was objected by this gentleman, that\r\nwhile the activity of the Governor was not to be disputed, exertions\r\nwisely directed were alone worthy of praise; and he compared the project\r\nfor netting the aborigines, with an attempt to harpoon a whale from the\r\nheights of Mount Wellington. The ardour of the people would not,\r\nhowever, admit a comparison which it required at that moment some\r\npolitical resentment to perceive. Nor is it precisely just to estimate\r\nthe merits of a plan, by the success of its application. A colonist at a\r\nglance sees, in the names which were attached to the addresses, that the\r\nwar was popular: all parties, of every shade, contributed something to\r\nthat warmth of commendation, which had been hitherto paid by one alone.\r\nIn every district of the colony, the applauses of Hobart Town were\r\nre-echoed, and the Governor's replies gave back an exchange of praise.\r\n\r\nTo suppose that Colonel Arthur expected military renown from such an\r\nenterprise, is certainly to under-estimate his ambition: to imagine that\r\nhe valued a military spectacle, is not consistent with a mind much too\r\npractical for chivalry. His avowed and real object was to stop the\r\nmurder of his countrymen, and to arrest the extinction of the natives;\r\nand it was not unworthy the public gratitude.[18] The Governor was\r\ndelighted, however, by those proofs of the discipline of the prisoners,\r\nwhich were afforded through the campaign: many hundreds were in arms:\r\nthey performed their duty with exemplary diligence and sobriety, and\r\nthus afforded the only spectacle which Colonel Arthur valued. It was\r\ncertainly unprecedented. Slaves have been armed by their masters--their\r\nwives and children were hostages--but convicts, never. Robberies were\r\nless frequent than usual, and the journals singularly free from the\r\ndetails of crime. The animating influence of confidence reposed,\r\nelevates the least romantic natures: since they were trusted, they were\r\nfaithful: all returned home to their servitude.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: The sheriff, Mr. Dudley Fereday, had before dismissed that\r\nportion which guarded the gaol: he affected to believe that the\r\nprisoners were not safe. There was small chance of escaping, so observed\r\nthe newspapers, while the civilians were on guard--the prisoners\r\nthemselves had given up all hope! But the sheriff thought otherwise, or\r\nmore probably availed himself of his office, to cast into the dirt the\r\nhonors of the civic guard; who had observed the forms of military\r\ndiscipline, and who merited a more distinguished termination to their\r\nservice.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.\r\n\r\nWhile the hostile proceeding was in progress, the future preserver of\r\nthe natives, Mr. Robinson, had already given his thoughts to their\r\nconciliation. In 1829, he was appointed to take charge of Brune Island,\r\nwhere twelve natives, captured, were located, and mixed with others who\r\nhad attained a partial civilisation. Mr. Robinson attempted to acquire\r\ntheir language, and was soon able to understand them. The pecuniary\r\nadvantages of his office were not very alluring: L50 a-year, and\r\nrations, were thought equal to obtain a person of good character to\r\nmanage the infant establishment, and to effect the proposed intercourse\r\nwith this unfortunate race. Mr. Robinson described his plan, _as the\r\nemployment of persuasion only_, and requiring the withdrawment of\r\nintimidation. He first laboured to acquire the language--a task of some\r\ndifficulty: the English were scarcely less ignorant on this subject,\r\nthan when they first landed, and the dialects of the tribes differed\r\nconsiderably. The aborigines were supposed to understand the English\r\ntongue much more extensively; but the words with which they were most\r\nfamiliar, were the imprecations so often addressed to them--they were\r\nable to retort common terms of menace. Their intercourse with\r\nbushrangers and stock-keepers on remote stations, was the chief source\r\nof their knowledge. To learn the language as an instrument of\r\ncivilisation, would be the first idea of a Christian missionary; but it\r\nwas a conception, too lofty for the colonial mind. It was forgotten that\r\nby no other means can savages be softened, or permanently conciliated.\r\nThe effect, when adopted, was electric: they learned to address Mr.\r\nRobinson as their _marmanake_, or father, and thus to distinguish him\r\nfrom other white men. The stupidity attributed to barbarians, and the\r\nvacant laughter, with which they receive the announcement of new ideas\r\nin a foreign tongue, would be ascribed, by experienced teachers, to the\r\nabsurdity of such a medium of communication.[19]\r\n\r\nThe plan adopted by Mr. Robinson, was not only humane--it was\r\nreasonable. The natives were proud of freedom: their restraint was\r\ndisguised, and by unvarying kindness he taught them to regard him as\r\ntheir friend; and thus they were prepared, not only to submit to his\r\nauthority, but to rely upon his promises. White men had thought it a\r\nmerit to deceive, and it required some skill to convince them. Having\r\nexplained the proposals of the government, he took with him several of\r\ntheir number, and went on his errand of mercy. The aborigines were\r\nevidently prepared for his mission. Most of the tribes had occasionally\r\ndirect intercourse with Europeans--true, the more frequent, the more\r\nhostile; but while they regarded the whites with hatred, this commerce\r\nenabled them to appreciate the presents provided to entice them, and\r\nfacilitated friendly communication. All on the east side of the island\r\nwere confederated; and when any were gained, they became agents in each\r\nother's pacification. The late pursuit, though it had not subdued their\r\nenmity, or even their courage, had convinced many that there was no\r\nsecurity but by peace. Others, however, long resolved to confide in\r\ntheir own strength, and to take refuge in the fastnesses of the island.\r\nSuch was the answer they gave to the messages of Robinson; but the late\r\nevents had separated them from each other--it had scattered their\r\ntribes: members of the same family were part in captivity, and the\r\nknowledge of their condition moved the sympathies of relations still at\r\nlarge. Of this, an affecting instance transpired in 1831. Some, who gave\r\nthemselves up, stated that they had been very unhappy: they had gone\r\nover the country, searching for their lost friends, of whom they could\r\ngain no tidings. We realise a softening scene, in contemplating these\r\nfragmentary tribes, traversing their ancient haunts, and uttering the\r\nunanswered, and then melancholy call which distinguishes their race.\r\nWhen this party were told that their relations were living under the\r\nprotection of Robinson, they expressed an anxious wish to join them, and\r\nmet them with exclamations of joy.\r\n\r\nThe numerous islands that surround the coast, greatly facilitated the\r\ndetention of captives: few of the male natives could swim; few\r\nunderstood the structure of a catamaran. The means of escape were not\r\neasily obtained, and for a time the novelty and repose of their bondage\r\nmitigated their dislike to its restrictions: these natural fortresses\r\nkept them in safety, without the aspect of a prison; and one or other\r\nisland was accessible from most points of the Tasmanian shore.\r\n\r\nColonel Arthur implied, by his closing proclamation, when he dismissed\r\nthe forces, that their labors formed the first series of a connected\r\nplan, only partially developed. The war was, in the estimation of the\r\nGovernor and his friends, a preparation for a mission of peace. It was\r\nfortunate that Robinson's early progress imparted to the warlike\r\nexpedition the _eclat_ of reflected success. It is not necessary to\r\nscrutinise the notion, or to teach what this history will not\r\nwarrant--that measures of conciliation are more successful, when pursued\r\nunder the forms of hostility. Had the milder method been tested at an\r\nearlier period, the expenses of the campaign might have been spared.\r\nColonel Arthur, however, warmly approved, and strenuously supported the\r\npacific mission: not only was he convinced that nothing further could be\r\nexpected from arms, but he felt a real compassion for the unfortunate\r\nrace. In this course, he found considerable opposition. \"_We strongly\r\nraise_ our voice,\" one editor remarks, \"against _their civilisation_.\r\nThe natives are not to be trusted; and the lives of all engaged in the\r\nmistaken policy of conciliation, are never safe for one moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe conduct of this mission, the Governor entrusted to the Aborigines'\r\nCommittee, originally consisting of Archdeacon Broughton, Rev. Messrs.\r\nBedford and Norman; P. A. Mulgrave, J. Thomas, S. Hill, and Charles\r\nArthur, Esquires. Their authenticated statements are embodied in these\r\npages: their sentiments accorded with their character, but were slightly\r\ntinged by the feelings of the day.\r\n\r\nTo devise the means of capture, and superintend their application, was\r\ntheir most important function. It was proposed by one gentleman,\r\nexasperated by injuries, or perhaps unconscious of the details of his\r\nplan, to pursue the natives with bloodhounds. Another suggested the\r\nemployment of a man, \"who would soon put an end to the eastern mob; and\r\nwho had already killed half that tribe, by creeping upon them and firing\r\namong them.\" He thought that \"the worst men were the best to engage\" in\r\nthis work. Another proposed to employ the sealers--men who had waged a\r\nwar of extermination with great success. It is but just to observe, that\r\nproposals like these, though received, were not favored by the Governor.\r\nThey are in the records of Office, connected with the names of their\r\nauthors, and they admit no other excuse than a reference to recent acts\r\nof aboriginal violence, which had shaken the common principles of\r\nBritish humanity.\r\n\r\nThe Governor had already announced the re-capture of the natives who\r\nescaped from Mr. Batman's, while he was absent at the war. They\r\nre-commenced depredations: he finally re-took them without bloodshed.\r\nBut the most pleasing intelligence, and that which chiefly inspired\r\nhope, came from the south-east extremity of the island: Mr. Robinson\r\nwent round the coast; touched at Macquarie Harbour, visited Circular\r\nHead, and Portland: there he took Lemina Beginna, a chief, and\r\ntwenty-two others, including thirteen conciliated at George's River.\r\nThese were brought round to Gun Carriage Island; a temporary abode,\r\nill-suited for their entertainment, and where several soon concluded\r\ntheir troubled career.\r\n\r\nLemina complained that, many years ago, his wife had been taken away by\r\nsealers, and entreated the Governor to procure her restoration; another\r\npetitioned, that his sister and his mother might be recovered from the\r\nsame vile oppressors. The sister was known as Black Jock, and seems to\r\nhave been greatly in request: she was in alliance with the leader of one\r\nof the parties--less modest than familiar. A sealer, from whom she had\r\neloped, when she came back to the coast demanded her, with some\r\nvehemence, as his wife! So much beloved was this Tasmanian belle. The\r\narbitration of these disputes was no easy task: though sufficiently\r\nridiculous, they often seriously endangered the mission. The Governor\r\nissued an order against the interference of the sealers, and declared\r\nMr. Robinson under the special protection of government.\r\n\r\nIn reference to these captures, the Governor publicly expressed his\r\ngreat gratification, and requested the colonists to promote pacific\r\nintercourse, by all available means. The discretion displayed by\r\nRobinson, not less than his courage, excited much admiration, and hopes\r\nwere entertained that the true means of safety were at last discovered.\r\nMr. Robinson now requested that the armed parties should be recalled,\r\ndepots established to afford an asylum to the captives, and additional\r\nagents employed. Mr. Cotterell, and others were engaged to act in\r\nsubordination to the movements of Robinson. The Sydney blacks, ten of\r\nwhom had been brought down by Mr. Batman, for the mission, had been\r\nfound less useful: they were rewarded, and sent home. The aborigines of\r\nNew Holland despised the Tasmanian blacks--a race, ignorant of the\r\n_womera_![20]\r\n\r\nIn the following September, 1831, Mr. Robinson obtained another\r\nconsiderable accession, assisted by Lemina Beginna: they travelled,\r\nbackwards and forwards, for four hundred miles, and found old\r\nacquaintances. Eumarrah, the chief of the Stony Creek tribe, when he saw\r\nMr. Robinson, ran to him and shook hands, and with five men and one\r\nwoman, gave himself up: three only of his tribe remained! The captives\r\nwere described as remarkably athletic: they talked incessantly, and\r\ncomplained bitterly that their women had been stolen. The inequality of\r\nnumbers confirmed this charge. While Robinson was with them, a boat's\r\ncrew came in sight; and it required all his influence to prevent the\r\nnatives from retreating with precipitation. Thus the evil they suffered\r\nin their first intercourse, pursued them to the last moment of their\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nM'Kay, who had been employed under Mr. Robinson, added to these\r\ncaptures. Two friendly native women accompanied him, and they followed\r\nthe track for a week. At last, they found the natives encamped in a\r\nplain: in the dead of night the party dashed in among them, and took two\r\nmen, one woman, and a boy. Surrage, also assisted by two native females,\r\ncaptured eight men and two women. Their method was curious: the tame\r\nwomen were sent up the hill, where the fires were seen: they returned;\r\nfour men followed them down to the boat, and six others, men and women,\r\nwere speedily seen in the footsteps of their companions.\r\n\r\nWhile these captures were proceeding, Mr. Robinson started for the\r\nSurrey Hills and Circular Head. He left the party lately conciliated in\r\nLaunceston: they were cheerful, and expected their proposed voyage to\r\nthe islands with great glee. They spoke of their past outrages without\r\nreluctance, which they justified by relating the cruelties they had\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was anxious to notice every instance of intrepidity and\r\nkindness: it is the coward that is ferocious. The indulgences of the\r\ncrown were freely given to persons, of whatever class, who exemplified\r\ncourage and humanity. Mr. Anstey, a young gentleman of the interior, was\r\nrewarded with five hundred acres. He had surprised and taken several,\r\nand the skill of his arrangements prevented the effusion of blood. In a\r\nfew instances, the natives voluntarily surrendered. Mr. Charles Headlam\r\nsaw two approaching, holding up their hands--thus indicating the absence\r\nof their spears: he was standing on the threshold when he remarked the\r\nsignal, and immediately lowered his gun. These unfortunate beings were\r\nadmitted into the house, and supplied with food; and finally conducted\r\nto a place of safety.\r\n\r\nThese feelings were occasionally damped by acts of atrocity, committed\r\nby the blacks. It is not to be supposed, however, that provocation\r\nceased, or that the impulse given by four years conflict, could be\r\nsimultaneously paralysed. The tribes frequenting the Tamar and the\r\nForth, were represented as becoming increasingly mischievous. The fate\r\nof Mrs. M'Alister was deeply affecting: when wounded, she ran bleeding\r\nfrom her dwelling: her servants carried off the children to a place of\r\nsafety. The unhappy mother concealed herself, for a time, in a field of\r\ncorn: unable longer to suppress her anxiety, she rushed from her hiding\r\nplace, crying out for her children. She was seen by the blacks, and\r\nslain! The relater of this catastrophe concludes--\"Let the sentence of\r\nextermination in their hearts, be firmly sent forth on our parts.\" If we\r\nshudder at such sentiments, they scarcely awaken surprise, when closing\r\na narrative like this.\r\n\r\nThe murder of Captain Thomas and Mr. Parker, by the Big River tribe,\r\nrenewed the exasperation. His servants, who had landed some provisions,\r\ngave a small portion to the natives. He was told by three of the blacks,\r\nthat many were in the woods, and he resolved to follow them. Parker, who\r\naccompanied him, advised him to take his gun. As they were walking, a\r\nnative snatched it away: they became alarmed and ran, and were pierced\r\nwith spears. This case seemed to indicate a hopeless spirit of innate\r\nmalice: Captain Thomas was known to be humane, and his object was to\r\nconciliate. The natives had, however, experienced great cruelties from\r\nthe servants and others. A coroner's jury brought in a verdict of wilful\r\nmurder: those charged were arrested, and committed to gaol; afterwards,\r\nthey were removed to Flinders. As the vessel rounded the coast, the\r\nscene of the murder was visible, and they became extremely agitated; but\r\nthe opinion of the colony was no longer favorable to executions, and the\r\ngovernment had discovered a more excellent way.\r\n\r\nMr. Robinson now landed at Circular Head, and assisted by his native\r\ncompanions, he followed up the Big River tribe: he fell in with the\r\nparty at Lake Echo; they had moved with haste, and left behind several\r\nstand of arms, a looking glass, and the gun of Captain Thomas. Other\r\nencampments were passed, but when Robinson approached them, they\r\ninvariably fled. They had been to a spot twenty miles south-east of the\r\nVan Diemen's Land Company's establishment, whither they were accustomed\r\nto resort for a mineral, which is found in a decomposed bed of felspar.\r\nFrom this place they were followed by Robinson, who overtook them thirty\r\nmiles north-west of the Peak of Teneriffe. He saw them first to the east\r\nof the Barn Bluff Mountain, and was not more than two miles distant. He\r\nhailed his people, and selected a few of his friendly natives, who,\r\ntogether with the woman present at the murder of Captain Thomas, were\r\nsent to meet them. The party of Robinson were concealed by a scrub. In\r\nless than half an hour he heard the war-whoop, and perceived that they\r\nwere advancing, by the rattling of their spears. This was an awful\r\nmoment to their pacificator. On their approach, the chief, Manalanga,\r\nleaped on his feet in great alarm, saying that the natives were coming\r\nto spear them: he urged Mr. Robinson to run, and finding he would not,\r\ntook up his rug and spears and went away. The rest of the allies\r\nprepared to follow him; but were prevailed on by Robinson to remain.\r\nThey inferred, that the natives sent on the embassy of peace, were\r\neither killed, or that they had joined the hostile tribe. As these\r\nadvanced, the friendly emissaries were unseen, being hidden by the\r\nlarger number of the strangers, who still raised their cry, and\r\napproached in warlike array. At length Robinson saw his own people: he\r\nthen went up to the chiefs and shook hands with them. He explained the\r\nobject of his visit; distributed trinkets among them, and sat down and\r\npartook refreshment with them. From that time they placed themselves\r\nunder his control, and as they advanced towards Hobart Town, he\r\nencouraged them to make excursions, which left their own actions free,\r\nand prevented suspicion and distrust. With their wives and children,\r\nthis party consisted of thirty-six, and at length they were safely\r\nlodged on Swan Island. They were fine muscular men, and excited great\r\ninterest and sympathy.\r\n\r\nThis incident suggested to the venerable artist, Mr. Duterreau, the idea\r\nof a national picture: he depicts the interview, and delineates the\r\nvarious countenances, drawn from the life, with great energy and effect.\r\nRobinson is seen in expostulation with a listening chief; a woman,\r\nbehind him, is endeavouring to pour distrust into his ear. Others are\r\nlooking on in expectation or in doubt. The grouping is skilful and\r\nexpressive; and this picture, which has the great merit of minutely\r\nrepresenting the attitudes and customs of the natives, will be an\r\ninteresting memorial, in another age, of the most honorable passage in\r\nTasmanian history.\r\n\r\nThe results of his enterprise produced a strong impression in favor of\r\nMr. Robinson: he had been thought rash, and even fanatical; his death\r\nhad been predicted a hundred times--his success was attributed, half in\r\njest and half in earnest, to some species of animal enchantment. The\r\ngovernment, at the suggestion of the Committee, acknowledged his\r\nexertions, not only with warm eulogy but substantial rewards. He\r\nreceived a maximum grant, in the title of which his service to the\r\npublic was recorded, and was paid a salary more suited to the office he\r\nfilled. Others were also liberally recompensed for their contributions\r\nto his success, of which the merit was more in its conception than in\r\nits detail.\r\n\r\nHaving shewn the possibility of conciliation, Mr. Robinson declined the\r\nfurther risk of his life, except on terms which would place his family\r\nbeyond the reach of want. The Governor fully met his just claims,\r\nproviding pensions for his wife and children, in case of his death, and\r\npromising L1,000,--L300 in hand, and the rest when all should be brought\r\nin. It was understood, that the future government of the aborigines\r\nshould be entrusted to his charge, when the mission had realised its\r\nintention. The Governor granted all his requests, and spared no expense\r\nto ensure his success. The task was not accomplished for several years,\r\nbut from this time the natives at large rarely appeared, and the\r\ncolonists enjoyed that repose to which they so long had been strangers.\r\nHis labours were attended with various and unusual perils. It was the\r\ncustom of the men belonging to the Circular Head establishment, to\r\napproach the native fires, and destroy all they could not capture. One\r\nnight, Robinson, with his black attendants, were on a point of land six\r\nmiles from the establishment: the people were attracted by the smoke,\r\nwhen turning accidentally, he saw seven men cautiously creeping round:\r\nthey had levelled their muskets: but for an instant recognition of his\r\nvoice, his labours and his life would probably have ended.\r\n\r\nMr. Robinson had learned, that a large party were approaching Arthur\r\nRiver, on their way to their own country, and returning from a warlike\r\nexpedition against those recently captured. He resolved to send four\r\nfriendly blacks, and three recent converts, to open a communication with\r\nthis tribe: they were to make signals, if successful. Two days after,\r\nthe sign was given. On reaching the farther bank, he saw the wild\r\nnatives coming towards him with their waddies and spears. He proposed\r\nthat they should re-cross with him: they, however, desired him to\r\nremain, promising to hunt for his entertainment. He consented, and made\r\nthem presents; but he left his son, and a small party, in the rear. He\r\nwas alarmed at night by a friendly native, who being acquainted with one\r\nof the hostile tribe, had learned that it was intended to murder him and\r\nhis people. Robinson concealed his knowledge from his companions, lest\r\ntheir fears should be too powerful to suffer their remaining with him.\r\nThe assassins extinguished their own fires, but did not lie down to\r\nsleep: Robinson kept his burning brightly, that he might watch their\r\nmovement. They were earnestly chattering, and were trimming their\r\nweapons, while one of their number insisted upon the cruelty of killing\r\nthe white man! On Robinson's rising, the whole seized their spears--one\r\ngrasped in their right hand, and a bundle in their left. The dogs of\r\nRobinson's party had been secured, and their spears removed; they,\r\nhowever, escaped, and he was left alone. In a moment, he darted into the\r\nscrub: at this retreat, they seemed struck with astonishment; and\r\nquickly covered by the thicket, their spears did not reach him. On\r\nclearing the scrub, he hastened to Arthur River, and crossed on a\r\nfloating tree. At this instant, the natives reached the bank: he was\r\nsoon joined by his own friends, and confronted the hostile party, who\r\nstood on the opposite bank flourishing their spears. Robinson cried out,\r\nthat he forgave their conduct, and offered them his protection. This\r\ninduced a girl and two men to join him; but his situation was perilous,\r\nand having made fires, as if for signals, he hastened away, to deposit\r\nthe proselytes in safety.\r\n\r\nThis tribe continued at large until 1834. They had determined never to\r\nbe taken--to subsist upon the _quoib_ (badger), and to perish rather\r\nthan yield. Finding Mr. Robinson in pursuit, they endeavoured to elude\r\nhis search by false direction sticks. The blacks in his company dreaded\r\nan ambush, and declared that they should all be slain, if they proceeded\r\nfurther, now that their pursuit was known to the hostile tribe. Mr.\r\nRobinson, however, resolved to persevere, and soothed their fears. The\r\nmarch was long and harassing, the natives having divided into three\r\nparties, the better to escape. They were captured: eight in February,\r\nthree in March, and in April, nine; and were embarked at Circular Head\r\nfor Launceston, and thence to Flinders' Island.\r\n\r\nThe Governor warmly congratulated the colony on its deliverance, but the\r\nnumbers that remained were greater than he imagined. The abolition of\r\nmartial law was deemed by some to be premature. Twenty were captured in\r\n1834, and seventeen in 1835. Mr. Robinson, after nine months pursuit,\r\ncame up with the small relics which were known to be still at large, in\r\nMiddlesex Plains, and found one man, four women, and two children: they\r\nhad travelled as far as the head of the Derwent. Two men, sent by\r\nRobinson with despatches from the place of their capture, were lost in\r\nthe bush, and perished. It was now announced, that no more aborigines\r\nwere at large: in this, both Mr. Robinson and the government were\r\nmistaken. Rumours, for several years, were continually stirring, of\r\nblacks fleeing in the distance; of the thin smoke, the native cry, and\r\nother indications of their presence. At length it was proved, that these\r\nwere not the ghosts of the departed tribes. In December, 1842, at\r\nCircular Head, seven persons were captured, and rejoined their long\r\nbanished countrymen. This remnant consisted of a single family: the\r\nparents about fifty years; the rest of ages from childhood to thirty\r\nyears. They were taken by a sealer, whose boat they had pilfered, and\r\nconveyed to Flinders'. They were more than usually intelligent in their\r\nappearance: they did not understand one word of English, and they had\r\nprobably retained to the last the primitive manners of their race.\r\n\r\nMr. Robinson was a builder at Hobart Town, his family was large, and\r\ndepended on his trade. It detracts nothing from his merit, while it is\r\nhonorable to the government, that he was a gainer by successful\r\nhumanity. The munificence of the crown, alone prevented a larger\r\nsubscription by the people; he had, however, the warm and unanimous\r\nexpression of public gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe character of his mission was supported by his conduct. He went\r\nunarmed, and if the natives approached him at all, they were devoid of\r\nfear and therefore of ferocity. He plunged into the heart of the forest,\r\nassumed the habits of a wanderer, and continued his absence for months\r\ntogether. He shared the danger of his allies, and confided in their\r\naffection: he encouraged their sports, and so far as could a white man,\r\nwithout debasement, he became one among them. Hitherto the English had\r\ndealt treacherously, and rarely approached their camps, but to oppress,\r\nto mock, or to destroy them. They now discovered, that all were not\r\nenemies, and kindness was felt more powerfully by contrast. It is said\r\nby Backhouse, that Robinson acted under a sense of religious duty; by\r\nMann, that he was a fatalist or predestinarian: he was calumniated by\r\nthe base and the envious: the ascendancy he acquired over the natives,\r\nthe Christian philosopher can easily comprehend. The effect of \"good\r\nwill to men,\" is peace on earth. Moral courage, united with generosity,\r\noften overpowers the suspicion and hostility, of even the most\r\nbarbarous. The coward dies, while the man of bold spirit dissipates the\r\nclouds of distrust, and wakens in others the confidence he himself\r\ncherishes. Nor is it necessary for the writer to observe, that Divine\r\nProvidence gives back often, the \"hazard of their lives,\" to the\r\nresolute in right, or that an omnipotent protector attends the footsteps\r\nof the merciful.\r\n\r\nThus, in their harassing life, parents and children had been divided,\r\nand families had been broken up in melancholy confusion: indeed, they\r\nhad ceased to be tribes, and became what they were called--mobs of\r\nnatives, composed often of hereditary enemies. Infanticide and distress,\r\nrapid flight, and all the casualties of a protracted conflict,\r\nthreatened them with speedy destruction. Had not Robinson appeared, the\r\nlast savage, hopeless of peace or safety, would have perished with his\r\nweapon in his hand. It was a great deliverance to this colony, as well\r\nas to the native. From the Windmill-hill at Launceston, whence a wide\r\nand beautiful country is visible, the spectator could discern the site\r\nof twenty aboriginal murders--settlers, servants, and infants; the aged\r\nand the kind had fallen, as well as the base hearted and cruel. It was\r\nsomething to know, that the fatal hand, which no precaution could\r\nresist, would be raised no more.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a mournful spectacle: the last Tasmanian quitting the\r\nshores of his ancestors: forty years before, the first settler had\r\nerected his encampment! A change so rapid in the relations of a people\r\nto the soil, will scarcely find a parallel in this world's history; but\r\nthat banishment which, if originally contrived, had been an atrocious\r\ncrime, was at last an act of mercy--the tardy humanity of Englishmen,\r\nwhich rescued a remnant, extenuated the dishonor of their cruelty to the\r\nrace. As for Mr. Robinson, he enjoyed, not only the bounty of the\r\ngovernment, but the affection of the natives--and the applause of all\r\ngood men. His name will be had in everlasting remembrance: happier\r\nstill, if numbered by the judge of all among his followers, who came\r\n\"not to destroy men's lives, but to save them.\"[21]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: \"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Kemp, of Mount Vernon at the mess at\r\nthe Macquarie Hotel, \"you see a sample before you, of what this colony\r\ncan produce, which we are now, one and all, making an unanimous effort\r\nto insure the enjoyment of in peace and comfort: if, when not only the\r\nnecessaries, but many of the luxuries of life are thus bountifully\r\nsupplied us, we are not loyal, we shall never be loyal. Fill your\r\nglasses, gentlemen--the health of his Excellency; and success to the\r\nvolunteers. Hip, hip, hip,--hurrah!\"--_Courier._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Thus, while at some stations in New Holland clergymen\r\nexplained in English the principles of Christianity, the thoughts of the\r\nnatives strayed to subjects more familiar, and cries of \"bacca\" and\r\n\"sugar,\" disturbed the gravity of devotion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Throwing stick.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: It would be difficult, however, to believe Mr. Robinson\r\nwas not satirical, when he wrote as follows;--\r\n\r\n\"The system adopted toward the aborigines of this territory is quite\r\noriginal. History does not furnish an instance, where _a whole nation\r\nhas been removed by so _MILD AND HUMANE A POLICY!\"_--Report H.\r\nCommons_--_Aborigines_, 1835.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of these captures, the question of future disposal\r\nwas slowly determined. Those lodged on Gun Carriage Island, through\r\ninjudicious restraint or want of pure water, or melancholy, rapidly\r\ndecreased. The government was bound to seek for them a more salubrious\r\nprison, or to restore them to the main land: an event, which would have\r\nensured their immediate destruction. Maria Island, recommended both by\r\nMr. Robinson and Mr. Bedford, was desirable, as contiguous; but nothing\r\ncould prevent an escape to the colony. Kent's Group, on the coast of New\r\nHolland, was next proposed; but the passage is difficult, and between\r\nthe islands, said the sailor witness, \"the sea pours like a sluice, and\r\nthe winds drive through like a funnel.\" Then came King's Island,\r\nsituated 140 miles north of Van Diemen's Land; but it was said to be\r\ninfested with badgers and bandicoots, and that the natives would retire\r\ninto the woods, and be no more found. Such was the extent of official\r\nknowledge, in reference to these dependencies, that to select a spot it\r\nwas necessary to appoint a special survey; but although the natives were\r\nfast dying, the vessel destined to this service was first sent for a\r\ncargo of timber!\r\n\r\nCaptain Jackson having visited the Straits, recommended Flinders',\r\nsometimes called Great Island. The aborigines who joined in this visit,\r\nwere delighted with the country: they returned to their companions with\r\nthe spoils of hunting, and celebrated their good fortune in songs. A\r\nsoldier, who accompanied the party, wholly differed from this report: he\r\nsaid the climate was bleak, the soil sterile, and destitute of springs;\r\nand his objections, though attributed to malice, have been confirmed by\r\nexperience. After much deliberation, Flinders' Island was preferred.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice, Sir John Pedder, opposed the removal altogether: too\r\ntruly he judged, it would be followed by rapid extinction. In denying to\r\nthe aboriginal remnant an asylum within the country of their\r\nforefathers, we inflicted the last penalty which can fall on a race,\r\nwhose lives the victors condescend to spare. It was too late, however,\r\nto repent; and pioneers were forwarded to the place of exile. The usual\r\nfatality attended the first choice of a township, but in 1832 Mr.\r\nBackhouse, at Colonel Arthur's request, proceeded to Flinders', where\r\nthe station was finally chosen; it was called, _Wybalenna_,--the \"Black\r\nMan's Village.\" The natives were under disguised military control, but\r\nwere exceedingly docile and submissive. Cottages were erected for their\r\nuse. The women found some amusement in sweeping their houses, and\r\ndepositing or replacing the articles of their furniture--their beds,\r\nbedsteads, tables, and stools: they washed the garments of their\r\nhusbands; who, when they had occasion to complain, threatened to work\r\nfor themselves. They had seen the wives of the soldiers washing, and\r\ninferred that this exercise was the special privilege of women.\r\n\r\nThe acting commandant, in 1832, reported them as in the highest health\r\nand spirits, full of intelligence, advancing step by step towards\r\ncivilisation: so they were described, and such was their aspect. They\r\nwere furnished with every article of domestic use, far more numerous\r\nthan usually fall to the lot of the English cottager, and which, to an\r\nIrish peasant, would suggest the idea of shopkeeping: the men, dressed\r\nin duck clothing and Scotch caps, voluntarily appeared with the\r\nsoldiers, and presented their necessaries for inspection.\r\n\r\nA large group watched the landing of Mr. Backhouse in silence; but when\r\ninvited, they rose up and shook hands; and when told that provisions had\r\narrived, they set up shouts of joy: they wore clothing, except in their\r\ndances, which they held thrice a-week, after sun set; they exhibited\r\nmuch cheerfulness, affability, and mutual kindness, and no great\r\ndeficiency of either physical or intellectual power.\r\n\r\nThe system pursued by Mr. Robinson at Flinders', is minutely described\r\nin papers published by the House of Commons. The establishment of--\r\n\r\n1. An aboriginal fund. 2. A circulating medium. 3. An aboriginal police.\r\n4. A weekly market: and 5. A weekly periodical.\r\n\r\nThe first four of these measures succeeded: the periodical _was not_\r\nsuccessful! but Mr. Robinson established a respectable currency: he made\r\nthe natives purchase all articles except food; and once, when the supply\r\nof tobacco was scanty, it rose to the price of 32s. per lb.! They were\r\ntoo prone to dilapidate and destroy their dwellings; they were therefore\r\nrequired to pay for the locks, cupboards, and doors. They were\r\ninstructed in the Christian religion, and displayed considerable\r\naptitude; but of some, it is remarked, that they were inattentive to\r\nlearning, and fond of the chase!\r\n\r\nThe civil and religious administration of Flinders' Island has been\r\noften changed, and subject to factions and disputes. The stories which\r\nfloat in the colony, respecting the little empire of _Wybalenna_, are\r\ngrotesque and humorous. No modern author will venture to look into the\r\nabyss of despatches, which develop its policy. To arrive at the truth\r\nwould require an amount of labour, perhaps not beyond its intrinsic\r\nworth, but involving large discussions and questions not without peril.\r\nMr. Backhouse, before leaving the colony, renewed his visit as the envoy\r\nof the government, to heal divisions which had broken out with virulence\r\nbetween the ecclesiastical and civil powers. He observes, that they\r\nprincipally resulted from misunderstandings, and with this caution we\r\nresign them to the curious of some other age. It may, however, be\r\nsatisfactory to know, that in the order of succession, Messrs. Darling,\r\nRobinson, Drs. Jeannerett and Milligan, have been commandants, and that\r\nMr. Wilkinson, Rev. Mr. Dove, and Mr. Clark, have filled the office of\r\nchaplain.\r\n\r\nThe religious manifestations of the aborigines are differently estimated\r\nby different minds: by some, considered purely mechanical and imitative;\r\nby others, as the simple expressions of a genuine piety. The evidence of\r\ntheir worth, would depend greatly on accompanying moral developments.\r\nThe piety of a proselyted heathen is like that of a child, more in\r\nsensibility than concatenated dogmata: they repeated a creed, only\r\npartially understood; but they also became conscious of a Superior\r\nPower, and a nobler destiny. The highly intelligent appreciation of\r\nreligious knowledge, attributed by their guardians, did not appear to\r\nthe casual visitor; and was probably, unconsciously, coloured. It does\r\nnot pertain to this work to examine the evidence of their personal\r\nreligion, which, however, sometimes had a conservative influence in\r\nlife, and to several yielded consolation in their last hours.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, Mr. Robinson entered on his office as commandant: believing\r\nthat his mission was accomplished, he gathered the people together, and\r\nmade a feast, in which they were to forget the animosities of their\r\ntribes, and join as one family. Scarcely was this union effected, when\r\nthe occupation of Port Phillip drew attention to the aborigines of New\r\nHolland. Mr. Wedge, who visited that country, made known to the\r\ngovernment the barbarity of the monstrous whites; who, so soon as they\r\ntouched those shores, wantonly stained their hands with native blood. To\r\nthat gentleman we owe our ability to trace to its origin, an\r\nextermination which has kept pace with the colonisation of that region.\r\n\r\nMr. Robinson proposed to remove the natives of Tasmania, then eighty-two\r\npersons, to Port Phillip. It was expected that their presence would\r\nexcite the curiosity, and stimulate the civilisation of the New\r\nHollanders; that possession of a flock, then 1,300 in number, would give\r\nuseful ideas of the bounty of their benefactors. It had been thought\r\ndesirable to reward the aboriginal guides, and one hundred ewes and\r\nthree rams were forwarded to the establishment, to be distributed among\r\nthem: a large addition was made by private benevolence. The increase of\r\ntheir flock, became a source of temporary profit to the natives: the\r\nwool was brought to Launceston, and exchanged for haberdashery, and\r\nother articles of domestic use.\r\n\r\nThe British government, after much hesitation, fearful of its\r\nconsequences to the Tasmanians, consented to their removal. In 1838, Mr.\r\nRobinson received the appointment of Chief Protector to the Aborigines\r\nof New Holland: the nature or the utility of that office, does not\r\nbelong to this work to discuss. By treaty with Sir George Gipps, the\r\ngovernment of Van Diemen's Land agreed to pay a sum annually for each\r\nten who might survive. The deportation was sanctioned by the blacks\r\nthemselves: the certificate, which bears their signatures, might be\r\nsupposed to represent a congress of heroes, or the pack of a\r\nhuntsman--names, which are chiefly borne by dogs and princes.[22] They\r\nwere anxious for the change, but quite incapable of estimating its\r\nresults. A party of twenty-two therefore accompanied Mr. Robinson, but\r\nthe issue was disastrous: called away by the duties of his office, he\r\ncould not extend to them a proper supervision: they were again exposed,\r\nin another land, to their old adversaries and seducers, the\r\nstock-keepers: they were too few to form a village, and death thinned\r\ntheir numbers: two returned to Van Diemen's Land, and afterwards to\r\nFlinders'. Of the rest, two were executed for murder. Mr. Batman had in\r\nhis house at Port Phillip, a native woman and two boys; but the New\r\nHollanders were rather the objects of aversion than sympathy: and,\r\nfearful of their violence, the Tasmanians avoided their company, and\r\nshowed no disposition to forsake their protector.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole period of their residence at Flinders' Island, it does\r\nnot appear that any white man on the station, or even of their own\r\ncolour, had preferred a criminal charge against one of them. The\r\ncommandant, as magistrate, possessed a summary jurisdiction; and the\r\nrestrictions in his court he could supplement with the forms and\r\nensignia of power. A late commandant, when he sentenced to small\r\npenalties for petty offences, sat at night; and to impress their\r\nimaginations, the hall of justice was guarded with drawn swords.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Achilles, Ajax, Buonaparte, King George, Hannibal, Peter\r\nPindar, Neptune, Tippoo Saib, Washington. A few only bore the names of\r\nordinary mortals.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IX.\r\n\r\nThe advances towards the final extinction of the natives, have been more\r\nrapid than was expected; but the certainty of that event was never the\r\nsubject of doubt. Sir George Murray, on the 5th November, 1830,\r\nanticipated, and wrote down their fate; and inferred, from their\r\ndecrease, that at no distant period the whole race would become extinct:\r\nbut he declared that the adoption of any course of conduct, with this\r\ndesign, either avowed or secret, would leave an indelible stain upon the\r\ngovernment of Great Britain! It will be seen, however, that the progress\r\nof decay was never arrested for a moment. The mortality at Brune and\r\nSwan Islands was not less than at Flinders'; but from 1832, a regular\r\naccount has been preserved.[23]\r\n\r\nOf the forty-five landed at Oyster Cove, in 1847, thirteen\r\nwere men, twenty-two women, and ten children. Such has been the progress\r\nof their decline, and with numbers so inconsiderable, the problem of\r\ntheir fate is solved.\r\n\r\nThe original amount of the natives has been a question much debated:\r\nlike a procession in a circle, a population in motion, when not\r\npersonally distinguished, will appear more numerous than the actual\r\ncensus. Mr. Kelly, who often had passed the coasts, calculated them at,\r\noriginally, 7,000, but he guessed their number to be 5,000 in 1830: the\r\nobvious error of the last estimate, would naturally suggest a doubt with\r\nreference to the former. Several hundreds were, however, seen in one\r\nassembly, within the last thirty years. At Hobart Town and Launceston,\r\nfrom one to two hundred have appeared together. It was their custom to\r\ndistribute themselves in parties, of from forty to fifty each. Their\r\nfires, kindled on the sea shore, were often left burning, when they had\r\nmoved on to the next stage; and those who saw the flames from\r\nship-board, concluded that aborigines were lying around them, and thus\r\ntelling their numbers by the fires, they were often greatly deceived.\r\nThe rapidity of their movements led to the same mistake: they appeared\r\nat places sufficient to establish an _alibi_, according to the current\r\nmeasures of distance. They had innumerable paths which shorten a\r\njourney, then unknown to the English: it was thus, that they were twice\r\nreckoned, even when carefully counted. No reliance, however, will be\r\nplaced by persons of experience on the rumour of numbers. Nearly all who\r\nreport an assembly, judge by imagination rather than minute inspection;\r\nthus, mobs are spoken of as tens or hundreds of thousands, without any\r\nintention to mislead. It will be the hope of the humane, that the lowest\r\nestimate is the true one: it can hardly be doubted, however, that they\r\nwere originally from 4,000 to 5,000: they were estimated by Mr. Robinson\r\nat 700, when he commenced his mission; 203 were captured--many, in the\r\nmean time, fell by unknown violence and perpetual persecution: a\r\nthousand muskets were charged for their destruction.\r\n\r\nThe causes of their diminution in Tasmania have been already stated; but\r\nsome of these continued their operation even after the capture: their\r\nnatural consequences followed. Towards the last days of their savage\r\nlife, the sexes were disproportionate, although the balance was partly\r\nrestored by associating the women who had been longer in captivity, with\r\nthe men whose wives had died; but many of these women had become\r\nlicentious, and by an extraordinary oversight the government permitted\r\nunmarried convicts and others to have them in charge, or to assist in\r\nthe preliminary labor of their establishment: the result need not be\r\ntold. The infant children had perished, by the misery or contrivance of\r\ntheir parents: thus in 1838, of eighty-two there were only fourteen\r\nchildren, and of the remainder, eight had attained the usual term of\r\nhuman life: many who surrendered, were exhausted by sickness, fatigue,\r\nand decripitude. They were the worn out relics of their nation, and they\r\ncame in to lie down and die.\r\n\r\nThe assumption of clothing occasioned many deaths: they were sometimes\r\ndrenched with rain--perspiration was repressed, and inflammatory\r\ndiseases followed: the licentiousness, and occasional want of the few\r\nlast years, generated disorders, which a cold brought to a crisis. Among\r\nsavages, the blanket has sometimes slain more than the sword: it\r\ndestroyed the Indian of North America, and even threatened the New\r\nZealander with a similar fate.[24] The abundant supply of food, and\r\nwhich followed destitution, tended to the same result: it was a\r\ndifferent diet. The habits of the chase were superseded, and perhaps\r\ndiscouraged: the violent action to which they had been accustomed; the\r\ndancing, shouting, hurling the waddy and the spear--climbing for the\r\nopossum--diving, and leaping from rock to rock--assisted the animal\r\nfunctions, and developed muscular power. To continue them required the\r\noccasion, as well as the permission; but the stimulus was gone.\r\n\r\nIt is said, by writers not favorable to the establishment at Flinders',\r\nthat attempts to force the customs and habits of a civilised people were\r\nunreasonably, and even ridiculously severe. However docile the blacks,\r\nand generous the intention of their teachers, the physical effects of a\r\ntotal change in the habits of a race are not to be disputed, or that\r\nwhat may be harmless when the result of choice, and founded on new\r\nmental and physical stimulants, is dangerous when the mind is vacant,\r\nand the objects of civilised exertion unappreciated. Perhaps, no one is\r\nblameable. In their social circumstances, we may indeed trace the\r\noccasion of decay, but they were no longer produced by cruelty.\r\n\r\nThere were, other causes. The site of the settlement was unhealthy: they\r\nwere often destitute of good water; the tanks preserved an insufficient\r\nsupply. It is admitted that they frequently suffered this lack; but it\r\nis stated, that they had sufficient allowed them when sick!\r\n\r\nIt is, however, clear, that many perished by that strange disease, so\r\noften fatal to the soldiers and peasants of Switzerland, who die in\r\nforeign lands from regret of their native country. They were within\r\nsight of Tasmania, and as they beheld its not distant but forbidden\r\nshore, they were often deeply melancholy: to this point the testimony of\r\nMr. Robinson is decisive, though not solitary.[25] They suffered much\r\nfrom mental irritation: when taken with disease, they often refused\r\nsustenance, and died in delirium. The wife, or the husband in perfect\r\nhealth, when bereaved, would immediately sicken, and rapidly pine\r\naway.[26]\r\n\r\nCount Strzelecki has propounded a curious notion of the laws of\r\nextinction, in reference to this race. He states that the mother of a\r\nhalf-caste can never produce a black child, and thus the race dies. His\r\nstatement would need the most positive and uniform testimony; but it may\r\nbe added to the curiosities of literature. The decrease of population\r\namong the inferior race, when harassed or licentious, is certain; but\r\nsurely there is nothing occult in this, or requiring further explanation\r\nthan is afforded by human cruelty and vice.\r\n\r\nAmong those who survive, is the wife of the native Walter George\r\nArthur, the half-caste daughter of Sarah an aboriginal woman. [Looking\r\nlately at a picture of Don Quixote, she pointed him out as the man who\r\nfought with the windmill.] Her mother has a younger son, now or lately\r\nat the Queen's School, and of pure aboriginal blood. A natural law, by\r\nwhich the extinction of a race is predicted, will not admit of such\r\nserious deviations.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, a Finance Committee of the Legislative Council proposed the\r\nrestoration of the natives to this colony. The frequent reference to\r\nhead-quarters by the officers in charge, perplexed the government; who\r\nalleged that the distance permitted the oppression of the natives, and\r\nexposed them to the caprice of their guardians. The measure was delayed\r\nfor four years; but in 1847, the dismissal of the commandant revived the\r\nproject, and in October of that year they were landed in Van Diemen's\r\nLand, and located at Oyster Bay, once a great station of their people.\r\nThe removal was unacceptable to the colonists; the outrages of former\r\nyears were remembered by many, as scenes of domestic mourning. No murmur\r\nhad ever been heard at the cost of their safety: it was deemed a small\r\natonement for a national wrong: nor will it be possible to state an\r\nexpenditure which the colonial public would be unwilling to sustain--to\r\nsmooth the last hours of this unfortunate race. The transfer of a part\r\nto Port Phillip, had been attended with fatal consequences to several,\r\nand had ended in murder and executions: it was feared that the vicinity\r\nof their former haunts might revive their habits of wandering, and once\r\nmore expose them to those gangs of felons who set no value on aboriginal\r\nlife. These sentiments led to a spirited remonstrance, in which many\r\nrespectable settlers concurred: the government had not anticipated\r\nopposition, or it may be presumed that a statement of the actual\r\ncondition of the natives, and the provision intended for their safety,\r\nwould have preceded this change in their abode. The dark shadows of\r\nformer years threw doubt on their present character: happily, however,\r\nthese impressions were erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe few who remain, are not likely to forsake the comforts of their\r\nhome: belonging to various tribes and different dialects, particular\r\ndistricts do not present equal attractions to all. They have learned\r\nalso to rear vegetables, and the greater number are said to be familiar\r\nwith English customs. By the census, they are assigned to the Church of\r\nEngland; but the distinctions of theology are beyond their\r\ncomprehension, and therefore their choice; and it is perhaps to be\r\nlamented, that from the period of their capture, they have not been\r\nplaced entirely under the parental care of some religious communion.\r\nThose who think lightly of missionary institutions, will find here no\r\nground for exultation in the disastrous surveillance of the civil\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen, of whatever rank, cannot fail to survey the aboriginal\r\nyouth, less in number than many a colonial household, with deep\r\nsolicitude; or when estimating their claims, to remember the fortunes of\r\ntheir fathers. Or should their helplessness and dependence ever tempt a\r\nruler to expose them to the corrupting influence of the lowest examples,\r\nand to assign them the meanest education, he may be recovered to some\r\nsense of justice by the following confession of a distinguished\r\npredecessor:--\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly, the being reduced to the necessity of driving a _simple\r\nbut warlike, and, as_ IT NOW APPEARS, NOBLE MINDED RACE, from their\r\nnative hunting grounds, is a measure in itself so distressing, that I am\r\nwilling to make almost any prudent sacrifice that may tend to compensate\r\nfor the injuries that government is unwillingly and unavoidably the\r\ninstrument of inflicting.\"--GEORGE ARTHUR.[27]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23:\r\n\r\n+-----+---------+-----+--------+\r\n|Date.|Captured.|Died.|Escaped.|\r\n+-----+---------+-----+--------+\r\n|1831 |    54   | --  |   --   |\r\n|1832 |    68   |  5  |   --   |\r\n|1833 |    42   | 40  |    3   |\r\n|1834 |    20   | 14  |   --   |\r\n|1835 |    17   | 14  |   --   |\r\n|     |---------+-----+--------+\r\n|     |   201   | 73  |    3   |\r\n+-----+---------+-----+--------+\r\n\r\nThe numbers were-- In 1836  In 1838  In 1847\r\n                      ----    ----      ----\r\n                       123      82        45]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: The Bishop of New Zealand has wisely protested against the\r\nblanketing process of depopulation.

Though boats were not employed, they constructed a catamaran\r\nof bark, or decayed wood, of the specific gravity of cork: these\r\nmaterials, tied together, enabled them to pass to the islands of the\r\nStraits.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Gunn found at Maria Island, and preserved for several months,\r\na catamaran, sufficiently tight and strong to drift for sixteen or\r\ntwenty miles: each would convey from four to seven persons. The\r\ncatamaran described by the French naturalist, found in Adventure Bay,\r\nwas made of pieces of bark, and held together by cords made of grass,\r\nand assumed the appearance of meshes worked in the form of a _pentagon_.\r\nMr. Taw, the pilot of Macquarie Harbour, saw the natives cross the\r\nriver: on this occasion, a man swam on either side of the raft--formed\r\nof the bark of the \"swamp tree.\" The distance between the islets is not\r\nsufficient to shut us up to the notion of a local creation.[28] A New\r\nHolland woman, taken to Flinders', remembered a tradition, that her\r\nancestors had driven out the original inhabitants--the fathers, it is\r\n_conjectured_, of the Tasmanian race. History carries us back to the\r\nyear 1642, and it is in vain to seek authentic information from a people\r\ndestitute of records, and perpetually wandering. The time between the\r\nfirst visit and colonisation, was quite sufficient to obliterate the\r\ntraces of earlier migrations.\r\n\r\n_Consanguinity._--A comparison of the Tasmanian with the European, would\r\ndiscredit a common root; but the wide spread family of man exhibits all\r\nthe shades and varieties, by which the extremes are connected.\r\nStrzelecki observes, that to account for this connection, is not less\r\nvainly attempted than an explanation of the existence of marsupials: but\r\nthe cases are not comparable. The difficulty, in reference to the human\r\nrace, is resolved by its intermixture: nature mingles none but kindred\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n_Stature._--The man of Tasmania, is from four and a-half to five and\r\na-half feet high. The skin is blueish black; less glossy than the native\r\nof the continent. The facial angle is from 73 deg. to 85 deg.. The features of\r\nthe women are masculine: the mammae become pyriform, and elongate in\r\nnursing. The hair is black, and woolly; sometimes luxuriant,\r\noccasionally long and glossy. The eyes are full: the eyelid dropping:\r\nthe iris dark brown: the pupil large, and jet black. The forehead is\r\nhigh, narrow, and running to a peak: the malar bones are prominent, the\r\ncheeks hollow, the breast arched and full: the limbs round, lean, and\r\nmuscular: the hands small; the feet flat, and turned inwards. The frame\r\ndoes not differ from the common structure of man, and by science is not\r\npronounced inferior, according to the rules of phrenologists.[29]\r\n\r\n_General Appearance._--The impression made upon spectators by the\r\nTasmanian race, has been curiously various. By some, they are said to be\r\nthe lowest in their physical organisation, their mental capacity, and\r\ntheir social condition. Those who saw them at the same period, and\r\ncompared them with the inhabitants of Port Jackson, differed entirely in\r\ntheir estimate. In the aged women, there was little to admire: of them,\r\neven Mr. Backhouse speaks with unwonted emotion: they reminded him of\r\nthe ourang outang; they were hideous! but he thought the younger women\r\nmore agreeable. Another visitor in 1830 describes them as having small\r\nhollow eyes, broad noses, nostrils widely distended; jaws like the\r\nourang outang; thin limbs; shapeless bodies; and a hideous expression of\r\ncountenance! Cook described them as having lips not remarkably thick;\r\ntheir noses moderately flat. Labillardiere noticed a peculiar projection\r\nin the upper jaw of children, which recedes in adult age. They certainly\r\ndo not correspond with our notions of beauty, but they are not inferior\r\nto millions of the human race. Among the captives, were some whose\r\nstature and port strongly impressed the spectator. Backhouse observed\r\none especially, whose features had a Jewish cast, and reminded him of\r\nthe popular pictures of Abraham! Their thin and wretched appearance,\r\noccasioned by their diet, and diseases, cannot be properly attributed to\r\ntheir constitution. Half starved human beings, unclothed, are ever\r\nunpleasing. Those acquainted with populous cities in Europe, have often\r\nbeen compelled to recognise, in the squalor and emaciation of classes,\r\nthe germs of a new race. The captive blacks, when partially clothed,\r\nrelieved from anxiety, and supplied with food, soon presented a new\r\naspect; and their countenances were lighted up with cheerfulness and\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n_Families._--Polygamy was tolerated: women were, latterly, bigamists.\r\nLabillardiere observed that one man had two wives: this philosopher was\r\nheld in suspense, on the comparative happiness of their condition; true,\r\nthe affections of the husband were divided--but they jointly catered for\r\none man instead of two! It is said that they courted with flowers: an\r\nauthenticated fact, proves that the female occasionally possessed a\r\nnegative. _Roomata_ (Bet) rejected the addresses of _Trigoonipoonata_\r\n(Jack); but she learned the worth of his affection. She was crossing a\r\nriver, and became ill: he sprung to her relief, and carried her safely\r\nto land; and she became his wife.[30] They daily brought game to the\r\nresidence of the superintendent, during his temporary absence--lest,\r\nsaid they, he should want on his return. The woman having been left\r\nbehind, on recovery followed the tribe with the new born infant. The\r\ntoil of the journey, and of the encampment, chiefly fell to her lot: she\r\ncarried utensils of all kinds, except the spears. The infant was slung\r\non the back, and suckled over the shoulder: a draftsman, in the company\r\nof Cook, drew the portrait of a young female, so burdened. The position\r\nof the child has been pronounced, without much reason, a proof of low\r\nmaternal sensibility. Those who have carried children through a journey,\r\ncan only imagine the amount of affection requisite to convey, often more\r\nthan one, after a tribe in its rapid migrations.\r\n\r\n_Infanticide._--Infanticide was not common; although, in the latter\r\ndays, when harassed by daily conflict, the practice, was not unknown. It\r\nis stated by Leigh, that they were careful not to increase in number,\r\nand that they sold their female children. At a later period, it is said,\r\nthat to suckle puppies they abandoned their offspring. Such facts are\r\nnot incredible, when they relate to individuals, but are scarcely\r\ncharacteristic of a race: all nations have perpetrated infanticide, from\r\nnecessity, or pride, or barbarism. Infant life is little valued among\r\nsavages, and female children least: they run the gauntlet of a thousand\r\nperils. Fewer were born than among settled people, and more died in\r\ninfancy.\r\n\r\nUncivilised man is ever harsh in his treatment of woman. The natives of\r\nthis country were less imperious than those of Port Jackson, where the\r\nblows of the waddy solemnised matrimony. Beside the burden of travel,\r\nthey chiefly hunted the opossum, and mounted the lofty trees of the\r\nTasmanian forest. When the man condescended to give part of his spoil,\r\nhe handed over his shoulder the least delectable pieces to his wife, who\r\nsat at his back. Often, however, this indulgence was refused. Mr. Horton\r\nrecords an instance of unkindness, perhaps not general, nor very\r\nuncommon: it was noon; the mother, her infant, and little boy, had been\r\nwithout food all day: the father refused any part of that he had\r\nprovided. Another of the tribe, however, was more generous: when he\r\nhanded the woman a portion, at Mr. Horton's request, before she tasted\r\nany herself, she fed her child.\r\n\r\nThey were often misunderstood; but they were sensible of domestic\r\naffections: the tribes were scattered by the last war--some were\r\ncaptives, others fugitives: eleven were already lodged at Richmond, when\r\nMr. Gilbert Robertson brought up two others, a man and woman: they were\r\nrecognised from afar by the party first taken; these raised the cry of\r\nwelcome; it was a family meeting, and deeply moved the spectators. The\r\nparents embraced their children with rapture, and many tears.\r\n\r\nUnder an engraving of a Van Diemen's Land woman and child, from a\r\npainting by J. Webber, the _Journal of Civilisation_ ventures the\r\nfollowing:--\"Contemplate the appalling picture! see her, in fact,\r\nwithout maternal affection! To such a mother, it would matter little to\r\nsee her babe fall from her back and perish!\" The woman of Van Diemen's\r\nLand, by the French artist, is most lively and maternal: her child is\r\nleaning over her head, its feet resting on her shoulders: she looks up\r\ntowards it, with a strong expression of affection. Labillardiere\r\nrepeatedly remarks the tenderness of the women to their children, as\r\n\"very engaging.\" He also had a theory: but why suppose a black woman\r\nbelow a tigress, in the scale of maternity. The law of nature, deadened\r\nby circumstances, but which is even strong in the brute, was not\r\ninactive in their hearts. In every country, it is individually variable.\r\n\r\nThere is a grave in a garden at Ben Lomond: Mr. Batman, the morning\r\nafter its little tenant was deposited, walked up to the spot; but\r\nalthough he went at sunrise, one person was earlier: a Tasmanian woman;\r\nwho sat by the grave, and wept. It was the mother.\r\n\r\n_Half-caste._--The half-caste children were oftener destroyed. A woman,\r\nwho had immolated an infant of mixed origin, excused herself by saying\r\nit was not a _pretty_ baby; this was, however, far from universal, and\r\nmore commonly the act of the tribe than of the mother. A native woman,\r\nwho had an infant of this class, fell accidentally into the hands of her\r\ntribe: they tore the child from her arms, and threw it into the flames.\r\nThe mother instantly snatched it from death, and quick as lightning\r\ndashed into the bush; where she concealed herself, until she made her\r\nescape. The injuries she received were, however, fatal. An elder\r\ndaughter, called Miss Dalrymple, was the first half-caste child born in\r\nthe colony: she was remarkably prepossessing: her eyes black, her skin\r\ncopper-colored, her cheeks rosy, and her limbs admirably modelled: she\r\nwas adopted by a settler.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of such children grew up in the island; but they\r\nwere neglected by their parents, and often inherited the vices or\r\nbarbarism of both. The females were early debased, and presented\r\nspectacles of nakedness and misery. When the Orphan School was formed, a\r\nfew children were admitted at the government charge; of these, a\r\nfragment survive.\r\n\r\nA half-caste couple were married recently at Launceston: the expression\r\nof their countenances was extremely pleasing. They had been sent up from\r\nthe Straits to obtain a legal sanction to their union, and they went\r\nthrough the ceremony with much sensibility. There is a register in St.\r\nJohn's Church, Launceston, of the marriage of an aboriginal pair in\r\n1829; the first ever celebrated in the face of the church.\r\n\r\n_Tribes._--Their tribes were distinct: they were known as the Oyster\r\nBay, the Big River, the Stony Creek, and the Western. There were smaller\r\nsub-divisions; but those enumerated were divided by dialects, and\r\nwell-established boundaries. Their chiefs were merely heads of families,\r\nand distinguished by their strength or cunning: they were thought to\r\npossess very trifling and uncertain control. It is said, that a\r\nnotorious bushranger (Howe) fell in with a tribe: he assisted his\r\ncompanions in lifting a boat, but as he appeared in command, the chief\r\nchecked him for lowering his dignity--a sovereign instinct, which shews\r\nthe heart of a true prince. When the chiefs accompanied white men in\r\ntheir sports, and were requested to carry their spoil, they often\r\nmanifested disdain and reluctance. Little is known of their policy, and\r\nprobably there was but little to be known. The natives lived in harmony\r\nwith each other, or when they quarrelled they decided by the weight of\r\ntheir waddies, and the thickness of their skulls. The aggressions of\r\nother tribes were punished by reprisals, but they rarely pursued a foe.\r\nOffences among themselves were treated according to their supposed\r\nenormity: the culprit had to stand while a certain number of spears were\r\nthrown at him. By this ordeal he was cleared, and the keenness of his\r\neye and the agility of his motions, usually enabled him to escape a\r\nfatal wound. Faults, of slighter consequence, were punished without\r\ndamage: the transgressor was set on the branch of a tree, and had to\r\nendure the mockery of the by-standers. It may be gratifying to discover\r\nsuch an example, in favor of the pillory!\r\n\r\n_Huts._--Their locomotion was predetermined, and their encampments\r\nregularly chosen; generally on the banks of a river or a lagoon. Each\r\nfamily had its fire; hunted separately, and erected a hut for its own\r\naccommodation. On the mountains, and beside the sea shore, they lodged\r\nin caverns; or where these were not found, as in the open country, they\r\nreared huts, or rather screens: these were of bark, half-circular,\r\ngathered at the top, and supported by stakes: in the front they kindled\r\na fire. These huts formed rude villages, and were seen from seventeen to\r\nforty together. The former number being raised by a tribe of seventy,\r\nfrom four to five must have lodged under one shelter. Some, found at the\r\nwestward, were permanent: they were like bee-hives, and thatched:\r\nseveral such were seen by Jorgenson, on the western shore--strong, and\r\napparently erected for long use. They drew water for the sick in shells:\r\nthe robust threw themselves on the bank, and drank as they lay. Boiled\r\nwater was not used in their primitive state; it is said to have been\r\nunknown. This is scarcely credible: a heated shell or stone, filled by\r\nrain water, might have discovered the secret. They preserved their fire,\r\nusually by carrying a brand; if this was extinguished, they replaced it\r\nby going back to their last encampment, where the fuel still smouldered.\r\nIt is said, that they were not ignorant of producing fire by friction.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Their appetite was voracious: a woman was watched one day,\r\nduring which, beside a double ration of bread, she devoured more than\r\nfifty eggs, as large as those of a duck. Mr. O'Connor saw a child, eight\r\nyears old, eat a kangaroo rat, and attack a cray-fish. The game they\r\ncast into the fire, and when singed drew it out and extracted the\r\nentrails; it was then returned to the embers, and when thoroughly\r\nwarmed, the process was completed. They were acquainted with the common\r\nexpedient of savage nations, who pass from repletion to hunger: they\r\ntightened a girdle of kangaroo skin, which they wore when otherwise\r\nnaked. Fat they detested; some tribes also rejected the male, and others\r\nthe female wallaby, as food: the cause is unknown. A few vegetable\r\nproductions, as the native potato, and a fungus, which forces up the\r\nground, called native bread, and which tastes like cold boiled rice; the\r\nfern and grass-tree, also yielded them food. White caterpillars and ant\r\neggs, and several other productions, supplemented their ordinary diet.\r\nThe animals on which they subsisted chiefly, were the emu, kangaroo,\r\nwallaby, and the opossum: the latter living in trees. They obtained a\r\nliquor from the cyder tree (_eucalyptus_), which grows on the Shannon,\r\nand elsewhere: it is tapped like the maple; its juice, of the taste of\r\nmolasses, trickled down into a hole at the foot of the tree, and was\r\ncovered with a stone. By a natural fermentation, it became slightly\r\nintoxicating; and in early days was liked by the stockmen.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter, the natives visited the sea shore: they disappeared\r\nfrom the settled districts about June, and returned in October. The\r\nwomen were accustomed to dive for shell fish, which they placed in a\r\nrude basket, tied round the waist. On these marine stations (as at\r\nPieman's River on the west coast), their huts were constructed with more\r\ncare. Heaps of oyster shells, which seem to be the accumulation of ages,\r\nstill attest their dependence on the abundance of the sea.\r\n\r\n_Dress and Ornaments._--In summer, they were entirely naked: in the\r\nwinter, they protected the shoulders and the waist by a dried skin of\r\nkangaroo. The women wore the same, with the addition of ruffles. The\r\ndress of Europeans greatly distressed them: they endured it no longer\r\nthan their visit; yet they were sensible of cold, and could bear less\r\nexposure to the weather than Englishmen. They sat close to their fires;\r\nand, during days of rain, continued under shelter. The men wore, on the\r\nhead, grease mixed with ochre--a sort of plumbago, found at the\r\nHampshire Hills: it was used partly for ornament, and partly as a\r\nsubstitute for cleanliness. Bits of wood, feathers, flowers, and\r\nkangaroo teeth, were inserted in the hair, which was separated into\r\ntufts, rolled and matted together. This decoration was denied the women:\r\ntheir hair was cropped close, with sharp crystal; some on the one side\r\nof the head only, in others like the tonsure of the priest. They were\r\naccustomed to ornament the body by several methods, differing perhaps\r\nwith different tribes. Patches of ochre and grease formed a considerable\r\nportion of their adornment. With a shining mineral they drew symmetrical\r\nlines on the neck, shoulders and face, and various parts of the body; in\r\nsome cases they resembled epaulettes, in others they imitated the eye:\r\nthey also made incisions, which they kept open by grease, till the skin\r\nwas raised, and the process complete: the torment they endured with\r\ngreat fortitude, and affected indifference. _Penderome_, the brother of\r\na western chief, underwent this operation, which was performed by a\r\nwoman with broken glass. The flesh of his shoulder opened like crimped\r\nfish; but he interrupted the process by antics and laughter. They wore a\r\nnecklace called _merrina_; it was principally composed of pearly blue\r\nshells, bored by the eye tooth, and strung on the sinews of kangaroo.\r\nThese shells were cleansed by the acid of wood steam, and received a\r\nhigh polish.\r\n\r\n_Arms and Implements._--Their utensils and weapons were simple: the\r\nbaskets, formed of grass, described by Furneaux, were not afterwards\r\nimproved, but they answered the end. The waddy was a short piece of\r\nwood, reduced and notched towards the grasp, and slightly rounded at the\r\npoint. The spear, nine or ten feet long, was pointed at the larger end,\r\nstraightened by the teeth, and balanced with great nicety. The spearman,\r\nwhile poising the weapon, held others in his left hand, prepared for\r\ninstant use: the spear, thus poised, seemed for a few seconds to spin,\r\nand it would strike at sixty yards, with an unerring aim. Labillardiere\r\ndescribes it well: the warrior grasped it in the middle; raised it as\r\nhigh as his head; drew it towards himself with a jerk, that gave a\r\ntremulous motion at the extremities, which accelerated its progress, and\r\ntended to support it longer on the column of air; it was darted at 100\r\npaces, and remained in a horizontal position for three-fourths of the\r\ndistance. The children were early trained to the exercise: Lieutenant\r\nBreton saw a child, five years old, throw a stick through the ring\r\naffixed to the wall of the gaol, with great precision.\r\n\r\nA chief, confined in Hobart Town gaol, taken on the Shannon, exhibited\r\nthese feats of quickness and strength. He would spring up into the air\r\nfive feet, and reel round and round, with uncommon rapidity. He threw a\r\nbroomstick, at twelve yards distance, through a hole in the sentry box,\r\nof but little larger diameter; and a lath, cast at thirty yards, pierced\r\na hat through and through. They used no throwing stick, or sling.\r\n\r\nIn the estimation of Europeans, their practice in war was savage and\r\ncowardly: \"they do not, like an Englishman,\" complained a colonial\r\nwriter, \"give notice before they strike.\" The perfection of war, in\r\ntheir esteem, was ambush and surprise; but an intelligent observer\r\nsometimes saw considerable cleverness in their tactics. Mr. Franks was\r\non horseback, driving cattle homeward: he saw eight blacks forming a\r\nline behind him, to prevent his retreat; each with an uplifted spear,\r\nbesides a bundle in the left hand. They then dropped on one knee, still\r\nholding the weapon in menace; then they rose and ran towards him in\r\nexact order: while they distracted his attention by their evolutions,\r\nother blacks gathered from all quarters, and within thirty yards a\r\nsavage stood with his spear quivering in the air. This weapon, ten feet\r\nlong, penetrated the flap of the saddle, and the flesh of the horse four\r\ninches, which dropped on his hind quarters. The rider was in despair;\r\nbut the spear fell, and the animal recovered his feet and fled. The\r\nservant, less fortunate than his master, was found some days after,\r\nslain. The attack was well planned, and exhibited all the elements of\r\nmilitary science!\r\n\r\nA tribe, who attacked the premises of Mr. Jones, in 1819, at the\r\nMacquarie, were led by a chief six feet high: he carried _one_ spear, of\r\na peculiar form, and no other kind of weapon: this he did not use, but\r\nstood aloof from the rest, and issued his orders with great calmness,\r\nwhich were implicitly obeyed. They formed themselves in a \"_half moon\r\nring_,\" and attacked the English with great vigour. The chief was shot:\r\nthey were struck with dismay, and endeavoured to make him stand; \"they\r\nmade a frightful noise, looked up to heaven, and smote their\r\nbreasts!\"[31]\r\n\r\nThe wars among them latterly, provoked by driving one tribe on the\r\nboundaries of another, were not infrequent; as everywhere, women were\r\nthe cause and object of strife. The tribes to the westward were the\r\nfiner race: those from South Cape to Cape Grim, had better huts, and\r\nthey wore mocassins on travel. Those on the east of the Launceston road\r\nwere confederate: towards the last, the Oyster Bay tribe committed their\r\nchildren to the care of the Big River tribe, many of whom had been slain\r\nby the western tribes, as well as by the English. It was this which\r\nincreased the difficulties of their conciliation: they had not only to\r\nbe reconciled to the English, but to each other. They were bold and\r\nwarlike in their carriage, and when exhibiting spear exercise, commanded\r\nthe admiration of the spectator.\r\n\r\n_Agility and Dexterity._--Their skill was chiefly exerted in obtaining\r\ntheir food: they were agile and dextrous. The opossum was hunted by the\r\nwomen, who by a glance discovered if the animal were to be found in the\r\ntree. They ascended trees of a tremendous height: they first threw\r\nround the trunk a rope, twice its girth, which they held in the centre,\r\nand by the left end, in one hand: having cut the first notch for the\r\ntoe, they raised themselves up by the rope, in an attitude sufficiently\r\nperpendicular to carry the hatchet or stone on the head. They then cut a\r\nsecond, and by a jerk of the bight of the rope, raised it up: thus, step\r\nby step, they reached the branch, over which the loose end of the rope\r\nbeing cast, they were enabled to draw themselves round. It is stated by\r\nBackhouse, that they only required these notches at the bottom of the\r\ntree; and they dispensed with them as the bark became smooth, and the\r\ndiameter diminished. They ascended almost as rapidly as with a ladder,\r\nand came down more quickly. When the ropes were of skin, or more\r\nperishable materials, the accidents must have been many and terrible.\r\nThis feat required considerable muscular strength, and in the weak\r\nproduced great physical exhaustion. They were swift of foot: when they\r\npossessed dogs, they ran nearly abreast of them; stimulated them by\r\nimitating the cry of the kangaroo, and were generally in at the death.\r\nTheir former practice was to fire the brush-wood, in which the game had\r\nsought shelter, and which they speared when driven out by the flames.\r\nThis practice was wasteful; besides exposing them to the charge of\r\narson, when they were only following the customs of the chase.\r\n\r\nTheir ability to conceal themselves, assisted by their color, proved the\r\nquickness of their eye, and the agility of their limbs. A shooting party\r\napproached a native camp near the Clyde, and found they had just\r\nabandoned their half-cooked opossums and their spears: excepting a small\r\ngroup of wattle bushes, at the distance of ten yards, the ground was\r\nfree of all but the lofty trees: the travellers immediately scoured this\r\nthicket, but on turning round they, in great astonishment, discovered\r\nthat opossums and spears were all gone. It was the work of a moment, but\r\ntraces of aborigines were unseen.[32]\r\n\r\n_Corrobories and Dances._--Their general assemblies were attended by\r\ngreat numbers: at these meetings they raised large fires, and continued\r\ndancing till midnight. They first began their movement round the pyre,\r\nwith slow steps and soft tunes: as they advanced more quickly, their\r\nvoices became more sharp and loud: they closed in upon the fire, and\r\nleaping close to the flame appeared in considerable peril. These\r\nmovements they continued; shrieking and whooping until thoroughly\r\nexhausted. It is hardly possible for the imagination to picture a scene\r\nmore infernal.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, on guard during the black war, watched a small group in the\r\ngaol yard round their night fires. One of them raised his hands, and\r\nmoved them slowly in a horizontal direction; and spreading, as if\r\nforming an imaginary fan or quarter-circle: he turned his head from side\r\nto side, raising one eye to the sky, where an eagle hawk was soaring.\r\nThe action was accompanied by words, repeated with unusual emotion: at\r\nlength they all rose up together, and uttered loud cries. The whole\r\naction had the appearance of an incantation.\r\n\r\nThe dances were various. The emu dance, was intended to represent the\r\nmotions of that bird: the horse dance, necessarily modern, was performed\r\nby their trotting after each other, in a stooping posture, and holding\r\nthe foremost by the loins: the thunder-and-lightning dance was merely\r\nstamping the ground. Their amusements were childish, and boisterous; but\r\nthey applauded themselves with the invariable phrase, \"_narracoopa_\"--very\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThey felt the incumbrance of clothing, when exhibiting their feats: the\r\npermission to strip was embraced with great gladness. They gradually\r\nwrought themselves into the most extravagant excitement: their pleasure\r\nwas in activity.\r\n\r\n_Language._--Their language varied: the four principal tribes had\r\ndifferent dialects. When they met at Flinders', communication was\r\ndifficult, yet their songs were the same. The language has never been\r\nreduced to rules, though vocabularies have been collected by Jorgenson,\r\nand others. The Rev. Mr. Dove furnished some additional information; but\r\nthough the specimens establish an affinity in these dialects, the\r\nresults are otherwise unimportant. The vowels greatly predominate: the\r\n_r_ is sounded rough, and lingering. The words are frequently liquid and\r\nmelodious. At Flinders' Island, the language was a mixture of several;\r\nbroken English, New Holland, and Tasmanian words formed the currency of\r\nthe island. In English, they dropped the _d_ and _s_; thus sugar is\r\ntugar, and doctor is togata. As with other barbarians, who have enjoyed\r\nthe benefit of our instructions, the epithets of licentiousness and\r\ninsult were most current, and most aptly applied. Strangers to abstract\r\nideas, their words expressed the most common objects, sensations, and\r\nwants. Their songs, which reminded Labillardiere of the music of the\r\nArabs of Asia Minor, were exceedingly soft and plaintive; their voices\r\nnot wanting in melody. They repeated the same note in soft and liquid\r\nsyllables; descended to the second bar, and finished with a third above\r\nthe key note. They sometimes varied, by suddenly running into the\r\noctave. Their strains were considered, by a Scotchman, a close\r\nresemblance to the Highland bagpipe. The stanzas they repeated again and\r\nagain: none have been translated, for which, it is said, they are\r\nunfit.[33]\r\n\r\n_Intellect._--Their intellectual character is low; yet not so inferior\r\nas often described. They appeared stupid, when addressed on subjects\r\nwhich had no relation to their mode of life; but they were quick and\r\ncunning within their own sphere. A country not producing any animal\r\ncapable of service; where nothing is sharper than stone; destitute of\r\ngrain, and of fruits of any value, could be inhabited only by a\r\nwandering race. Their locomotion sharpened their powers of observation,\r\nwithout much increasing their ideas. In such circumstances, mind may\r\ndegenerate, but it cannot advance. Some colonists were recently\r\nstartled, by the appearance of a white family from the remote interior:\r\nthey were found by a surveyor, who at first took them for savages; they\r\nhad the animal expression of the eye, which is so common to uncivilised\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe inferiority of the aboriginal mind is not to be denied. Intellectual\r\npower is both hereditary and improvable: the exaltation of a generation\r\nof men gives the infancy of the next a more forward starting point--what\r\nwas individual is diffused, until it becomes characteristic of the race.\r\n\r\nThey were fond of imitation, and humour: they had their drolls and\r\nmountebanks: they were able to seize the peculiarities of individuals,\r\nand exhibit them with considerable force.[34]\r\n\r\nIn several parts of the colony rude drawings have been discovered.\r\nCattle, kangaroo, and dogs, were traced in charcoal. These attempts were\r\nexceedingly rude, and sometimes the artist was wholly unintelligible. At\r\nBelvoir Vale, the natives saw the Company's two carts, drawn by six\r\noxen: they drew on bark the wheels, and the drivers with their whips.\r\nThey were the first that ever passed that region.\r\n\r\n_Disposition._--They were cruel in their resentment; but not prone to\r\nviolence: that they did not shorten the sufferings of animals taken for\r\nfood, will hardly be considered by sportsmen decisive evidence against\r\nthem. They were not ungrateful; especially for medical relief, which\r\nappeared a favor more unequivocal than presents of food.\r\n\r\nA little boy, captured by a surveyor in 1828, when seen, sprang into the\r\nwater, where he remained for a long time: at first, he was greatly\r\nalarmed, but soon became contented. He pointed to the lady of the house\r\nas a lubra. Entering a room, where a young lady was seated, he was told\r\nto kiss her: after long hesitation, he went up to her; laid his fingers\r\ngently on her cheek, then kissed them, and ran out!\r\n\r\nSome captives, taken by Mr. Batman, were lodged in the gaol: they became\r\nstrongly attached to the javelin man: they were treated by the gaoler\r\nwith studious compassion, and they _left the prison with tears_!\r\n\r\nThe English were seen by some friendly natives to draught the toad fish,\r\nwhich is poison, and by which several have perished: the natives\r\nperceiving its preparation for food, endeavoured to shew, by gestures,\r\nthat it was not to be eaten, and exhibited its effects by the semblance\r\nof death. Not very long after, a native was shewn a pistol, which a\r\nwhite man snapped at his own ear; and who, giving the unfortunate black\r\none shotted, encouraged him to perform the same manoeuvre; he was thus\r\nmurdered by his own hands. The natives were variable, from ignorance and\r\ndistrust; probably from mental puerility: thus, their war whoop and\r\ndefiance were soon succeeded by shouts of laughter.\r\n\r\n_Religious Ideas._--Their religious ideas were exceedingly meagre and\r\nuncertain. To Mr. Horton's enquiries, in 1821, they answered, \"don't\r\nknow,\" with broad grins: he was probably not understood. They appear to\r\nhave had no religious rites, and few congenial ideas: they dreaded\r\ndarkness, and feared to wander from their fires: they recognised a\r\nmalignant spirit, and attributed strong emotions to the devil. The feats\r\nimputed to his agency, do not much differ from the sensations of\r\nnight-mare: they believed him to be _white_--a notion supported by very\r\nsubstantial reasons, and suggested by their national experience: this\r\nidea must have been modern. They ascribed extraordinary convulsions to\r\nthis malignant power, and to his influence they traced madness. Lord\r\nMonboddo might have contrived their account of the creation: they were\r\nformed with tails, and without knee-joints, by a benevolent being:\r\nanother descended from heaven, and compassionating the sufferers, cut\r\noff the tail; and with grease softened the knees.\r\n\r\nAs to a future state, they expected to re-appear on an island in the\r\nStraits, and \"to jump up white men.\" They anticipated in another life\r\nthe full enjoyment of what they coveted in this. These scraps of\r\ntheology, when not clearly European, are of doubtful origin: nothing\r\nseems certain, except that they dreaded mischief, from demons of\r\ndarkness. Though they had no idols, they possessed some notions of\r\nstatuary: it was sufficiently rude. They selected stones, about ten\r\ninches high, to represent absent friends; one of greater dimensions than\r\ncommon, Backhouse observed that they called Mother Brown.\r\n\r\nPersons of sanguine minds are apt to attribute to them religious ideas,\r\nwhich they never possessed in their original state. The notion of a\r\nspirit, however, exists on the continent: in this, the Tasmanian black\r\nparticipated. Their ideas were extremely indefinite, and will not\r\nrefute, or much support the belief, that the recognition of a Divinity\r\nis an universal tradition.\r\n\r\n_The Sick._--They suffered from several diseases, which were often\r\nfatal. Rheumatism and inflammations were cured by incisions: the\r\nloathsome eruption, called the native leprosy, they relieved by\r\nwallowing in ashes: the catarrh was very destructive, in certain\r\nseasons; a whole tribe on the Huon perished, except one woman. The\r\nnative doctor said, that it was the _devil_ that killed them: the woman\r\ndescribed the process by feigned coughing. Their surgery was simple:\r\nthey cut gashes with crystal. They treated a snake bite by boring the\r\nwound with a charred peg; stuffed it with fur, and then singed off the\r\nsurplus to the level of the skin. They had faith in charms: thigh bones\r\nwere especially useful, and were fastened on the head in a triangle:\r\nthese relics were found very effectual. There were some who practised\r\nmore than others, and therefore called doctors by the English: one of\r\nthese feigned inspiration, and brandished his club. The sick were often\r\ndeserted: their tribes could neither convey them, nor wait for their\r\nrecovery. Food and a lenitive were left within their reach, and when\r\nable they followed their kinsmen; the alternative is the terrible risk\r\nof a wandering life. This custom was modified by circumstances, and\r\nsometimes by the relatives of the sufferer.\r\n\r\nLike the natives of New South Wales, they called to each other, from a\r\ngreat distance, by the _cooey_; a word meaning \"come to me.\" The Sydney\r\nblacks modulated this cry, with successive inflexions; the Tasmanian\r\nuttered it with less art. It is a sound of great compass. The English,\r\nin the bush, adopt it: the first syllable is prolonged; the second is\r\nraised to a higher key, and is sharp and abrupt.[35]\r\n\r\n_Funereal._--When they felt the approach of death, they were anxious to\r\nexpire in the open air, and requested to be carried forth, even from the\r\nhouses erected for their use. They believed that the spirit lingers in\r\nthe body until sun-down. The French naturalist, Labillardiere, first\r\nnoticed the burning of the dead. His account was ridiculed by the\r\nQuarterly Reviewers, who suspected cannibalism; but there are proofs\r\ninnumerable, that this was a practice of affection. A group of blacks\r\nwas watched, in 1829, while engaged in a funeral. A fire was made at the\r\nfoot of a tree: a naked infant was carried in procession, with loud\r\ncries and lamentations; when the body was decomposed in the flames, the\r\nskull was taken up by a female,--probably the mother. The skull was long\r\nworn wrapt in kangaroo skin: Backhouse observed a couple who carried,\r\nalternately, this ghastly memento of their child: it is said, that they\r\ndeposited several together, in final resting places.\r\n\r\nThey were jealous of spectators, and took offence if they approached\r\ntheir dead. Bodies not consumed, were placed in hollow trees, and closed\r\nin by underwood: decomposition being completed in these natural tombs,\r\nthe survivors carried away the bones. Backhouse saw a striking funeral:\r\na woman died; they built a pile of logs; laid the body thereon, and\r\nwatched all night. At daybreak they applied the brand; then covering\r\ntheir faces with the ashes, which became furrowed with their tears, they\r\nsat down and lamented!\r\n\r\nJust after the capture, an aborigine told his tribe that his\r\ndeath was at hand. He requested them to prepare the wood for his\r\nobsequies, while he leaned against a tree, directing their sad labors:\r\nhe died that night! This is touching. A savage preparing for his\r\nfuneral, with a calm consciousness of his fate--midst the ruins of his\r\nfading race!\r\n\r\n             *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIn closing this mournful record, the reader is conscious that the\r\nhistory of the Tasmanian is but the experience of myriads. As an\r\nexhibition of Providence, it fills us with astonishment;--of human\r\npassions, with humiliation and sadness. The current of immigration will\r\nnot be diverted by abstract questions of human rights, nor will states\r\nmodel their policy to preserve the barbarian; but the path of history is\r\nclear, and even self love, which may carefully _sift evidence_, must not\r\nturn from the lessons it offers.\r\n\r\nThe original occupation of this country necessarily involved most of the\r\nconsequences which followed: was that occupation, then, just? The right\r\nof wandering hordes to engross vast regions--for ever to retain\r\nexclusive property in the soil, and which would feed millions where\r\nhundreds are scattered--can never be maintained. The laws of increase\r\nseem to suggest the right of migration: neither nations nor individuals\r\nare bound to tarry on one spot, and die. The assumption of sovereignty\r\nover a savage people is justified by necessity--that law, which gives to\r\nstrength the control of weakness. It prevails everywhere: it may be\r\neither malignant or benevolent, but it is irresistible. The barbarian\r\nthat cannot comprehend laws or treaties, must be governed by bribes, or\r\nby force. Thus, that the royal standard was planted, need occasion no\r\nremorse; but though the native had not exclusive natural rights, he\r\npossessed the attributes of man, and the government was bound to\r\nascertain his wants, and protect his interest in the country. England,\r\nhowever, forgot the aborigina: she secured him no refuge--provided no\r\ninterpreter to his feelings; his language was unknown, and his testimony\r\ninadmissable.\r\n\r\nThe legal recognition of rights in the soil, pertaining to the native\r\ninhabitants of colonised regions, is attended with some difficulty, and\r\nnowhere greater than among hunting tribes: their actual possession is\r\nonly definable, by admitting the wide boundaries of the chase. The\r\nParliamentary Committee, in a review of the whole question, did not\r\nrecommend treaties with savages: the terms would be liable to disputes,\r\nand a difference of interpretation would occasion distrust and\r\nanimosity. A middle course might, however, be open. The natives have an\r\nequitable lien on the land, for which rulers who transfer its occupation\r\nare bound to provide effectively and for ever. Instead of making the\r\ndeath of the native the release of private incumbrance; instead of\r\nmaking it the constant interest, and daily effort of the settler, to\r\ndrive him away, it ought to have been the object of the crown to\r\nidentify the life of the native with the welfare of the intruder. In\r\ngranting possession of lands, the terms might have given the settler a\r\nclaim for remission of price--or a pecuniary reward, payable out of the\r\nproceeds of land--for every native child he might rear, and every family\r\nhe might induce to choose him as their protector. Thus the shepherd\r\nprinces would have felt that their interests harmonised with the\r\nexistence of a race, now regarded with dislike and jealousy. The native\r\npolice at Port Phillip, suggested originally by Captain Maconochie, is\r\nan adoption of this principle: they are useful, and therefore pains have\r\nbeen taken to attach them. It is in vain to make laws, and to issue\r\nproclamations to shield the aborigines, unless they are identified with\r\nsome local interest; and for this, no sacrifice of the land revenue\r\ncould be considered too great.\r\n\r\nA youth, called Van Diemen, was nine years old when found in the wood,\r\nand adopted by Col. Davey; he was subsequently taken to England by Mr.\r\nKermode. He had been taught to read, and could repeat several chapters\r\nof the Bible. He was remarkably keen and intelligent. [On his return to\r\nthis colony, he was cut off by consumption: at the _post mortem_ it was\r\nfound that his lungs were nearly gone.] Mr. Kermode endeavoured to\r\nprevail with Lord Bathurst, to authorise a grant of land; but Mr. Wilmot\r\nHorton, then Under Secretary, objected that there were millions of\r\nBritish subjects, whose claims were of the same kind, and that the\r\nprecedent would be inconvenient. At the same time, men in chains were\r\nreceiving grants of land, and emancipists as a matter of course; but the\r\nminister was opposed to admit a claim founded on birth, orphanage, and\r\ncivilisation, lest it should multiply applicants. As if anything could\r\nhave been more desirable to the philanthropist and politician: who can\r\nwonder that convicts despised that which the ministers of the crown\r\nrepudiated? Excepting the often pernicious donatives, occasionally\r\nconferred, the aborigina was treated only as a foreigner, a slave, and\r\nan enemy. Thus the order of Lord Hobart stood alone: it was a record of\r\nintention, not a development of government. The ministry washed their\r\nhands, and averted their eyes; and threw upon the colony the\r\nresponsibility of inevitable crime.[36]\r\n\r\nBut the government of England, not only left undefined the obligations\r\nit seemed to confess: it did more; it let loose on the shores of\r\nTasmania its outcasts, its robbers, and its homicides; it released their\r\nbonds, and sent them forth to contest with the native for the animals of\r\nchase--to cross his path unwatched--to destroy him unpunished. Crimes of\r\nevery kind were visited, save this. For a word, or a look, the felon was\r\nbrought to the triangle; but when he shot down the native, and acquired\r\ndistinction by his butcheries, justice became scrupulous: the laws were\r\nsilent--religion and humanity were silent; and the fallen black, like\r\nthe uprooted forest, was thought of as an encumbrance removed!\r\n\r\nThe state of the census was equally reprehensible: England not only\r\nforgot the prescriptions of nature, and formed communities of _men_, but\r\nthe inevitable consequence to the natives was utterly neglected. It\r\nwould be impossible even to hint the series of facts, which are\r\nauthenticated to the writer, and which strangely blended ferocity and\r\nlust. The sealer, or stockman, who periled his life to accomplish the\r\nabduction of a native female, thought that danger but fairly avenged by\r\nthe destruction of her relatives! Thus far the government was remiss and\r\nculpable. The crimes of individuals, without diminishing _their_ guilt,\r\nmust be traced to those general causes, which are subject to the\r\ndisposal of statesmen and legislators.\r\n\r\nBut when the colony was planted, and the people spread abroad, it was\r\nthe duty of the crown to protect its subjects of every class: it was the\r\nduty of its officers to arrest the arm of the black man, however great\r\nthe provocation that raised it. They could not stand by to investigate\r\ncauses; to divide between the two races the proportions of crime, while\r\nthe innocent family was exposed to violence. It was better that the\r\nblacks should die, than that they should stain the settler's hearth\r\nwith the blood of his children. In this view Colonel Arthur was right:\r\nhis estimate of the native character was not impartial, for he beheld it\r\nwhen it only appeared detestable. He had no choice; he resolved to\r\nprotect his countrymen.\r\n\r\nIt is common to speak of the guilt of this community; sometimes in\r\nvariance with reason and truth. That guilt belongs only to the _guilty_;\r\nit cannot contaminate those who were helpless spectators, or involuntary\r\nagents. The doctrine of common responsibility, can only be applicable\r\nwhere all are actors, or one is the representative of all. The colonist\r\nmay say, \"I owe no reparation, for I have done the native no wrong; I\r\nnever contemplated aiding in his destruction: I have seen it with\r\nhorror.\" May the lesson of his sufferings become the shield of his race!\r\nThose who impute guilt to this colony, forget that its worst members are\r\nnot stationary, and that many have borne away their guilt with their\r\npersons. That Being, who makes requisition for blood, will find it in\r\nthe skirts of the murderer, and not on the land he disdained.\r\n\r\nNo man can witness the triumph of colonisation, when cities rise in the\r\ndesert, and the wilderness blossoms as the rose, without being gladdened\r\nby the change; but the question which includes the fate of the\r\naborigines,--What will become of them?--must check exultation. The black\r\nwill invade rights he does not comprehend; seize on stragglers from\r\nthose flocks, which have driven off his game; and wound the heel which\r\nyet ultimately treads him to the dust. Such is the process--it is\r\ncarelessly remarked, that the native is seen less often; that it is long\r\nsince he ventured to cross the last line, where death set up landmarks\r\nin the slain. At length the secret comes out: the tribe which welcomed\r\nthe first settler with shouts and dancing, or at worst looked on with\r\nindifference, has ceased to live.\r\n\r\nIf the accounts of discoverers have been too flattering to the native\r\ncharacter, they are explained rather than contradicted by the early\r\ncolonists. These describe, with exultation, their new acquaintance, when\r\nwriting to their friends: how peaceful, light-hearted, and obliging.\r\nThey are charmed by their simplicity; they sleep among them without\r\nfear: but these notes soon change; and passing from censure to\r\nhatred, they speak of them as improvident, importunate, and\r\ninstrusive; as rapacious and mischievous; then as treacherous and\r\nblood-thirsty--finally, as _devils_, and beasts of prey. Their\r\nappearance is offensive, their proximity obstructive: their presence\r\nrenders everything insecure. Thus the muskets of the soldier, and of the\r\nbandit, are equally useful; they clear the land of a detested incubus.\r\n\r\nIt is not in the nature of civilisation to exalt the savage. Chilled by\r\nthe immensity of the distance, he cannot be an equal: his relation to\r\nthe white can only be that of an alien, or a slave. By the time\r\nastonishment subsides, the power of civilised men is understood, and\r\ntheir encroachment is felt. Fine houses garrison his country, enclosures\r\nrestrict his chase, and alternately fill him with rage and sadness. He\r\nsteals across the land he once held in sovereignty, and sighs for the\r\nfreedom and fearlessness of his ancestors: he flies the track of his\r\ninvaders, or surprises them with his vengeance;--a savage he was found,\r\nand a savage he perishes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON THE CAUSES OF THE BURNING OF THE DEAD BY THE VAN DIEMENESE.\r\n\r\n[From Peron's Voyage, 1802.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On a wide swarth of verdure (at Maria Island), beneath some antique\r\ncasuarinae, rose a cone, formed coarsely of the bark of trees inserted at\r\nbottom in the ground, and terminated at top by a large band of similar\r\nmaterials. Four long poles stuck in the earth, sustained and served for\r\nall the pieces of bark to lean against; these four poles seemed also\r\ncalculated to ornament the building; for, instead of uniting all their\r\nupper extremity like the bark, and so forming a simple cone, they\r\ncrossed each other about the middle, and then extended without the roof\r\nof the ornament. From this disposition resulted a sort of inverted\r\ntetracdic pyramid in the upper part opposed to the cone below. This\r\ncontrast of form in the two parts of the building had a somewhat\r\ngraceful effect, which was increased by the following additions:--With\r\neach of the four sides of the pyramid corresponded a wide strip of bark,\r\nthe two bent extremities of which were at the bottom bound together by\r\nthe large band, which, as I before noticed, united all the pieces of\r\nbark at the top of the cone: it follows that each of these four strips\r\nformed a sort of oval, least rounded at its inferior extremity, and\r\nwidest and most rounded above; and as each of these ovals corresponded\r\nwith one of the sides of the inverted pyramid, it is not difficult to\r\nconceive the elegance and picturesque effect of the plan.\r\n\r\n\"After looking some time at this monument, the use of which I vainly\r\nstrove to fathom, I soon resolved to push my examination to a greater\r\nlength: I removed several thick pieces of bark, and readily penetrated\r\nto the interior of the building. The whole of the upper part was vacant:\r\nat the bottom was a large flattened cone formed of a fine light grass,\r\nlaid with much care in conuntric and very deep strata. With my doubt\r\nrespecting the purpose of this, my curiosity increased. Eight small bent\r\nsticks crossing each other at the summit of this cone of verdure, served\r\nto preserve its form; each of these sticks had its two extremities\r\nfastened in the earth, and kept firm in their position by a large piece\r\nof flattened granite. So much care led me to expect some important\r\ndiscovery; nor was I mistaken. Scarcely had I raised the upper layers\r\nof turf, ere I perceived a large heap of white ashes, apparently\r\ncollected together with nicety: thrusting my hand into the midst of\r\nthese, I felt something hard, withdrawing which, I found it to be the\r\njaw-bone of a man, and shreds of flesh still adhering to it. I shuddered\r\nwith horror. Still, reflecting a little on all I had observed in the\r\ncomposition of the monument, I soon experienced sensations widely\r\ndifferent from those I felt at first: the verdure, the flowers, the\r\nprotecting trees, the deep bed of herbage which covered the ashes, all\r\nunited to convince me that I had here discovered a tomb.... Succeeding\r\nideas caused new reflections: I asked myself, 'What can have originated\r\nthis custom of burning the dead? Separated from the rest of the world,\r\nand at its farthest extremity, these people cannot have adopted it from\r\ncommunication with others; it must irrefutably therefore be an idea of\r\ntheir own. But, in that case, wherefore prefer this mode of disposing of\r\nthe dead? Can the preference be the effect of chance? Or does there\r\nexist some physical reason for it, dependent on the nature of things, or\r\nthe particular social organization of these men?' ...\r\n\r\n\"This last measure is to burn it. Every thing concurs to facilitate this\r\nexpedient; every thing in this is accordant with the mode of life of the\r\ninhabitant of these shores, as well as the circumstances in which he is\r\nplaced. Fire, that powerful and terrible agent, their recourse on so\r\nmany and such valuable occasions, cannot fail of exciting among these\r\npeople some of those sentiments of veneration, consecrated with the\r\nmajority of ancient nations by such numerous institutions and religious\r\nmonuments. Without being deified, perhaps, as formerly it was, fire in\r\nthese countries is regarded as something superior to the other works of\r\nnature; and these first ideas will probably have contributed not in a\r\ntrivial degree to the determination of burning their dead. The requisite\r\nmaterials for the purpose were at hand: neither calculation nor labor\r\nwere required for putting the plan in execution; no instrument was\r\nnecessary; and it prevented taint and the consequent infection. But a\r\nfew remains of bones would be here after the operation, to cover which\r\nthe ashes of the fire would be sufficient. The whole ceremony required\r\nonly a few hours; and prejudices tended to render it reputable and\r\nsacred. Thus then this practice of burning the dead does not appear to\r\nbe the effect of mere chance: accordant with physical and local\r\ncircumstances, these evidently were the origin of the custom.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Despatch to Lord Goderich, 6th April, 1833.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: The following is worth remembering, as a caution to\r\nreviewers, as well as philosophers:--\"At Port Dalrymple, in Van Diemen's\r\nLand, there was every reason to believe, the natives were unacquainted\r\nwith the use of canoes; a fact, extremely embarrassing to those who\r\nindulge themselves in speculating on the genealogy of natives: because\r\nit reduces them to the necessity of supposing, that this isolated people\r\nswam over from the main land, or that they were _aboriginal_.\"--_Rev.\r\nSidney Smith, Edin.

It will be our object to ascertain\r\nthose incidents which illustrate its local operation--to trace events\r\nthat have attended the repeated changes in its colonial spirit. It\r\nbelongs to the British statesman to scan its effects on the population\r\nof the empire; but fairly to exhibit its Australasian aspect, will not\r\nbe without utility to the colonies themselves.\r\n\r\nAlthough a separate relation will derange the thread of Tasmanian\r\nhistory, the reader may be compensated by a view more perspicuous and\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nThousands of British offenders, who by their exile and sufferings have\r\nexpiated their crimes, trod almost alone the first stages of Austral\r\ncolonisation, and amidst toils and privations, initiated a progress now\r\nbeheld by nations with curiosity and admiration. Economists still weigh\r\nin uncertain balances the loss and the gain, and the legislator longs\r\nfor facts which may decide the perpetual conflict between them who\r\ndenounce and those who approve this expedient of penal legislation. It\r\nis not the intention of this narrative to anticipate conclusions: its\r\ndesign will be accomplished when the story of the past is truly told.\r\n\r\nExile, the penalty denounced by the Almighty against the first homicide,\r\nwas among the earliest affixed by man to lesser crimes, or whenever the\r\npresence of the offender endangered the public repose. The Roman law\r\npermitted the accused to withdraw from impending judgment by a voluntary\r\nexile. Such was the practice in the time of Cicero. When men sought to\r\navoid bondage or death, adjudged by the laws, they had recourse to exile\r\nas to an altar; nor did they forfeit their civic standing, except with\r\ntheir lives.[37]\r\n\r\nAt a later period, under the imperial government, the islands of the\r\nMediterranean became places of exile: several thousand Jews were\r\nbanished from Rome to the Island of Sardinia.[38]\r\n\r\nTransportation was unknown to the common law of England, but abjuration\r\nof the realm, which resembled the Roman practice, was not infrequent:\r\n\"it was permitted,\" said Sir Edward Coke, \"when the felon chose rather\r\nto _perdere patriam quam vitam_,\"--to lose his country rather than his\r\nlife. The culprit having found sanctuary within the precincts of a\r\nchurch, took oath to abjure the realm: assuming the character of a\r\npilgrim, he received a cross to protect him on his journey. By the Act\r\nof James I. the privilege of sanctuary was taken away,[39] and thus the\r\nabjuration, founded upon it, virtually abolished.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish was the first Christian nation which to banishment united\r\npenal labor. Columbus found it difficult to allure adventurers: to work\r\nthe mines, was necessary to gratify his patrons, and he prevailed on\r\nFerdinand to furnish colonists by clearing the galleys. These recruits\r\nattended the great discoverer on his third expedition (1498): they\r\nlargely contributed to the disorders which vexed the infant settlement,\r\nand aroused the resentment of the unfortunate Indians.[40]\r\n\r\nBanishment was first formally recognised by English law in the reign of\r\nElizabeth (39 Eliz. cap. 4).[41] It was enacted, that \"dangerous rogues,\r\nand such as will not be reformed of their roguish course of life, may\r\nlawfully by the justices in their quarter sessions be banished out of\r\nthe realm, and all the dominions thereof, and to such parts beyond the\r\nseas as shall for that purpose be assigned by the privy council.\" Return\r\nwas made felony without benefit of clergy. A brand was affixed upon the\r\nshoulder, of the breadth of an English shilling, with a great Roman R\r\nupon the iron: \"for a perpetual mark upon such rogue, during his or her\r\nlife.\"[42]\r\n\r\nUntil commerce had extended the knowledge of distant parts, and the\r\nconstant publication of correspondence with colonies made their affairs\r\nfamiliar, imagination depicted them as desolate and frightful. The\r\nLondon apprentice and the plough boy, thought of exile as a severe\r\ncalamity. The love of home was rendered more intense, by the universal\r\nwilderness imagined beyond it: thus, loss of country was deemed a\r\npenalty fully equal to ordinary offences, and more severe than any\r\ndomestic form of punishment short of the scaffold.\r\n\r\n\"_Duri est non desiderare patriam. Cari sunt parentes; cari liberi,\r\npropinqui, familiares; sed omnes omnium caritates patria una complexa\r\nest: pro qua quis bonus dubitet mortem oppetere?_\"\r\n\r\nIt is to James I. that the British nation and the colonists owe the\r\npolicy, whether salutary or baneful, of sending convicts to the\r\nplantations: \"the good sense of those days justly considered that their\r\nlabor would be more beneficial to an infant settlement, than their vices\r\ncould be pernicious.\"[43] James directed the sheriff to deliver, and the\r\ngovernor and court of Virginia to receive one hundred prisoners,\r\nincluded in the definition of rogues and dangerous persons, and\r\ncompelled the proprietors of that colony to become agents in their\r\ndeportation.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chief Justice Kelyng stated, that about the time of the\r\nrestoration it became customary for a prisoner within benefit of clergy\r\nto procure from the king \"a conditional pardon,\" and to send him beyond\r\nthe seas to serve five years in some of the king's plantations; there\r\n_to have land assigned him, according to the usage_ of those plantations\r\nfor servants after their time expired.[44] A needless delay of\r\ndeparture, or a return within the period appointed, made the instrument\r\nof pardon void.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Charles II. an act passed (Car. ii. 13, 14. cap. 2. s.\r\n1), \"for preventing dangers that may arise from certain persons called\r\nquakers,\" which authorised their transportation beyond the seas. Thus,\r\nthe practice was not new: after the battle of Worcester, the parliament\r\ntransported the royalists, and in the mutations of power all parties in\r\ntheir turn transported each other.\r\n\r\nIt had not been unusual for persons to sell themselves for a term of\r\nyears. After the dissolution of the army of the commonwealth, many, to\r\nescape danger and poverty, sold their liberty to others, who carried\r\nthem to the plantations.[45]\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of Monmouth, a letter was addressed by James II. to the\r\ngovernor of Virginia, which after reciting that the royal clemency had\r\nbeen extended to many rebellious subjects by ordering their\r\ntransportation, required the governor to propose a bill to the assembly\r\nto prevent their redemption, by money or otherwise, until the expiration\r\nof ten years. The assembly declined to carry out the royal vengeance,\r\nand received the exiles with kindness.[46]\r\n\r\nIn 1717, transportation assumed a prominent place in English\r\njurisprudence. An act of parliament (4 Geo. i.) recited that the\r\ncustomary punishments were inefficient, and that the \"labor of criminals\r\nin the colonies would benefit the nation;\" and mentioned the \"frequent\r\nfailure of those who undertook to transport themselves.\" Under this law,\r\nthey were committed to the charge of ship-masters, who gave bonds for\r\ntheir transit; and who were obliged to produce certificates that they\r\nhad disposed of their cargo according to law. It is said that L40,000\r\nper annum were raised by the contractors, carrying annually two thousand\r\nprisoners, whom they sold for L20 each.[47] For a long time these\r\nimportations were highly acceptable; the demand for labor reconciling\r\nthe colonists to the attendant evils. The object of the law was to exile\r\noffenders from the mother country, and bondage in America was simply\r\nintended to indemnify its cost. It was in the power of the captains to\r\nset them free, or a friendly agent by appearing as a purchaser might\r\nrelease them.[48] When landed, they were sold by auction to the\r\ncolonists, for the term of their sentence; and even the royal pardon did\r\nnot cancel an obligation to serve--except by the repayment of the\r\npurchase money to the planter.\r\n\r\nThis course had many inconveniencies, and led to atrocious crimes. The\r\ntreatment of the convict depended on the individual who bought his\r\nservice: the state imposed but slight responsibilities, and the colonial\r\ncontrol was regulated by local laws.\r\n\r\nMany notices in annals of those times indicate that the practice of\r\nkidnapping, especially of youth, was not uncommon. Johnson, in his\r\nimmortal memoir of the poet, Savage, numbers in the catalogue of his\r\nmother's cruelties, an attempt to send him captive to the plantations,\r\nand to sell him for a slave.\r\n\r\nGoldsmith refers to establishments devoted to this species of\r\nslavery:--\"I regarded myself as one of those evil things that nature\r\ndesigned should be thrown into her lumber room, there to perish in\r\nobscurity. It happened that Mr. Crispe's office seemed invitingly open\r\nto give me a welcome reception. In this office Mr. Crispe kindly offers\r\nto sell his Majesty's subjects a generous promise of L30 a year; for\r\nwhich promise, all they give in return is their liberty for life, and\r\npermission to let him transport them to America as slaves.\"[49]\r\n\r\nBefore the era of separation, the American planters had begun to resent\r\nthe influx of felons. Free labor grew plentiful, and the colonial\r\nreputation was compromised: nor were these the sole reasons for\r\nopposition; the management of negro slaves became a capital branch of\r\ndomestic industry; the _prestige_ of color was endangered by the\r\nsubjection of white men to the discipline of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe practice of transportation did not terminate until the era of\r\nindependence. The Canadas remained loyal; but the ministers of the day\r\ndid not deem it prudent to reward their submission with the stigma of\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nFranklin, when the colonists were about to cast off the imperial rule of\r\nGreat Britain, complained of this system: he compared it to pouring\r\n\"cargoes of rattlesnakes on the shores of England.\" He, however,\r\nmaintained that this description of exiles formed but a small proportion\r\nof the American people; that of one million, eighty thousand only had\r\nbeen brought over the ocean, and of these one-eighth only were convicts.\r\nIn reference to the number transported to America, the accounts of the\r\nBritish and American writers considerably differ. None were sent to the\r\nNew England colonies. Jefferson, during his diplomatic residence in\r\nFrance, furnished a statement for the _Encyclopedie Methodique_, in\r\nwhich he asserted that the convict element of the American population\r\nwas too small to deserve enumeration. He estimated the total number at\r\n2,000, and their descendants at 4,000, in 1785, or something more than\r\none-thousandth part of the entire people. This calculation has been,\r\nperhaps justly, charged with partiality; but it is useless to meet error\r\nby conjecture.[50] This obvious topic of sarcasm was early adopted.\r\nParty writers poisoned the shafts of political warfare, by references to\r\nthe convict element of the trans-atlantic population: \"their Adam and\r\nEve emigrated from Newgate,\"[51]--\"their national propensities to\r\nfraud, they inherited from their convict ancestors,\"--\"they are the\r\noffspring of convicts, and they have retained the disposition of their\r\nfelon progenitors.\" Such were the sayings of critics, lords, and\r\nstatesmen: it was thus they described a people, who among their\r\nforefathers can enumerate heroes and saints; who, flying from the\r\nscourge of bigotry and despotism, laid the foundation of an empire. Can\r\nwe expect more complacency?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _Oration, pro A. Coesin._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: _Tacitus_, ann. 285.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: _Discourse, by the Right Hon. Wm.

A distemper, generated in the damp and foetid atmosphere\r\nof gaols, carried off thousands: to be charged with an offence, was to\r\nbe exposed to the risk of a malady generally fatal. Sometimes, it passed\r\nbeyond the precincts of prisons: at Taunton, the judges and other\r\nofficers of the court, and hundreds of the inhabitants, perished.\r\n\r\nHoward, after spending a large portion of his life in retirement and\r\ndevotion, was chosen sheriff of Bedfordshire. He exposed the sufferings\r\nwhich he witnessed; and accelerated transportation, by revealing the\r\nsecrets of the prison house. It is needless to describe his labors--they\r\nbelong to all nations: he reproved kings, and received the blessings of\r\nthousands ready to perish; and he lost his life in the service of\r\nmankind.[52]\r\n\r\nThe attention awakened by Howard, the philanthropist, led to the general\r\nimprovement of prisons (1779). A variety of projects were suggested for\r\nthe disposal of prisoners: some it was proposed to confine in\r\ndock-yards, salt works, mines, or where concentrated labour might be\r\npossible. Mr. Eden, at first, suggested that enormous offenders should\r\nbe sent to the Mahomedan ports, and sold for the redemption of\r\nChristian slaves, or be employed on the coasts of Africa, on small\r\nislands, for the benefit of navigation.[53] It was recommended by a\r\ncommittee of the House of Commons to transport criminals to the coast of\r\nAfrica and the East Indies. These plans were effectually resisted, or\r\nfailed of their design.\r\n\r\nJudge Blackstone and Mr. Eden contrived a scheme, in concert with\r\nHoward, which they embodied in the \"Hard Labor Bill.\" Its object was\r\ntwofold: to establish labor houses all over England, and to regulate the\r\nemployment of convicts on board the hulks. This measure was published\r\npreparatory to its being submitted to parliament, and fell into the\r\nhands of Bentham. Hailing the movement as fraught with important\r\nimprovements, he produced his Panopticon, which he described as\r\napplicable to all houses of industry, and wherever inspection is\r\nconstantly required. The plan exhibits remarkable ingenuity: the\r\nseparation being made consistent with continual oversight, and an\r\neconomy of space with health and exercise. The design of the building\r\nitself is circular: the external area cut up into angles, and separated\r\nby walls running to a common centre. The interior is formed of a\r\nsuccession of circles, not inaptly compared by the satirical opponents\r\nof the scheme to a spider's web.[54] He afterwards accompanied his plans\r\nwith minute definitions of the objects and methods of penal coercion.\r\n\r\nSir John Parnell, chancellor of the Irish exchequer, Mr. Pitt and Lord\r\nMelville of the English ministry, were anxious to establish the\r\npanopticon system in their respective countries. The design was not\r\nformally abandoned until 1813, when the erection of the Millbank\r\nPenitentiary, extinguished the scheme of Bentham. He had written\r\npolitical articles offensive to the court: George III. had attempted to\r\nrefute his opinions, and cherished towards him the antipathy of a rival.\r\nA contract was formed with Bentham, to erect and conduct his panopticon:\r\nhe had received possession of a spot of land assigned for the purpose,\r\nand nothing was wanting but the royal signature to his official\r\nappointment. His hopes were finally crushed by the obstinacy of the\r\ninexorable king.[55]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _Quarterly Review_, vol. ii. p. 322.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: As a congregational dissenter, he was liable to a fine of\r\nL500, for not taking the sacramental test. It is some credit to human\r\nnature, that he was not interrupted or punished in his career of\r\ncharity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: _Eden's Discourse on Banishment._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: _Quarterly Review_, 1822.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Dr. Bowring's account, received from Bentham in 1824. In\r\n1813, Jeremy Bentham, on account of penitentiary, L23,578.--_Par. Pap._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nWhatever advantages were supposed to pertain to a system of domestic\r\npunishment, it was opposed by formidable difficulties. To Bentham's\r\nsystem it was objected, that it required a supervision practically\r\nunattainable. The enthusiasm, ability, and integrity of the projector,\r\nit was alleged, would be probably confined to himself; and although the\r\nbetter plan, while under his eye, it would prove of all the most\r\ndangerous and inefficient, when directed by the unskilful and\r\ncorrupt.[56] Nor did it prevent the return of the offender to society,\r\nand thus a relapse into crime.\r\n\r\nThe large preliminary outlay required to test the scheme of Bentham,\r\nwhich exceeded his first calculations, was urged against its trial, and\r\nits complicated details wearied the attention of the county magistrates.\r\nThey preferred transportation, and cheerfully resigned the offender to\r\nthe good or ill-fortune of his colonial career.\r\n\r\nThese views were strengthened by the increasing aversion to capital\r\npunishments. To detain a criminal for life seemed cruel to himself, and\r\nto release him would be perilous to the community. His treatment while\r\nin bonds, would vary with the temper of individuals entrusted with his\r\npunishment. This, Bentham himself confessed: he observed--\"different\r\ntempers prescribe different measures of security and indulgence. Some\r\nforget that a convict in prison is a sensitive being; others that he is\r\nput in there for punishment. Some grudge him every gleam of comfort or\r\nalleviation of misery, to which his situation is susceptible; to others\r\nevery little privation, every little unpleasant feeling, every\r\nunaccustomed circumstance, every necessary point of coercive discipline,\r\npresents matter for a charge of inhumanity.\"[57]\r\n\r\nTo American transportation, the following is a summary of his\r\nobjections. 1. It was unequal: a man who had money might buy off the\r\nservitude. Again, with regard to banishment, it was unequal: some would\r\nhave been glad to go by choice, others would rather die. 2. It was\r\nunexemplary: what the convict suffered, be it much or little, was\r\nunknown. 3. It was unfrugal: it occasioned great waste of life in the\r\nmode, and of money in the expenses of conveyance. 4. It did answer in\r\nsome degree, in disabling the offender from doing further mischief: yet\r\nit has always been easier for a man to return from transportation than\r\nto escape from prison. 5. It answered, every now and then, the purposes\r\nof reformation pretty well; but not so well upon the whole, under the\r\nvariable and uncertain direction of a private master, whose object was\r\nhis own profit, as it might be expected to answer under regulations\r\nconcerted by the united wisdom of the nation.[58] In these objections to\r\nAmerican transportation the colonists will recognise familiar\r\nsounds--the chief elements of the arguments, in times both remote and\r\nrecent, against the practice of transportation.\r\n\r\nThe worst class of criminals were often found in London, before their\r\nfirst sentence had expired. Many suffered capitally for this offence.\r\nBefore the practice of contracting with shippers, political offenders\r\npreferred the continent of Europe to the hardships of America. It was\r\nmade felony, without benefit of clergy (20 Geo. ii.), for rebels under\r\nsentence of transportation to reside either in France or Spain; and the\r\ninhuman penalty was denounced against their friends who might correspond\r\nwith them in any form. When the crown carried out the sentence, the\r\noffender's return was still capital, and though unpopular, the guilty\r\nrarely escaped the penalty on conviction.\r\n\r\nWhen this colony was established, the chief towns of Great Britain were\r\nhaunted by innumerable thieves, who were organised for the purposes of\r\nrobbery. In London armed men assailed passengers by night, and even by\r\nday. The arrest of robbers was accompanied with considerable danger, and\r\nit was not until towards the close of the eighteenth century that the\r\nmilitary guard ceased to attend executions. A vast multitude of persons\r\nhad degenerated into a robber caste. They lodged under the arches of\r\nbridges, or nestled in nooks or corners, wherever they could burrow. The\r\ndistricts of the city occupied by the better class of society, seemed\r\nbut a small portion of the metropolis--like islands in a sea of vice and\r\ndestitution. There were numerous places of savage amusement and small\r\ngambling houses; and young men of family, hanging loose on the world,\r\nnot unfrequently became amateur adventurers in crime. The populace felt\r\nno aversion to a highwayman of spirit. The pursuit of criminals became a\r\nvoluntary and profitable calling, and offenders against the laws were\r\nencouraged and sheltered, until they were ripe for the executioner.\r\n\r\nEvery part of London was the scene of executions: malefactors were hung\r\nin chains on every common and way-side. The populace treated the culprit\r\nwith cheers or hisses, according to their view of his crime. Many wore a\r\nwhite cockade in their hats, in token of their innocence, when they were\r\ncarried in procession to the scaffold.[59]\r\n\r\nTo compensate for the feebleness of the police, and the popular sympathy\r\nwith crime, the crown paid L40 for each capital conviction. In 1796, a\r\nconspiracy was developed, which led to the legal slaughter of seventy\r\npersons, at a profit to the conspirators of L2,800. In 1818, the\r\nlegislature reluctantly terminated this traffic in blood.[60]\r\n\r\nThus, after much discussion, the plan of a new penal settlement was\r\nfinally preferred: denominated, in the official correspondence, \"the\r\nimproved Colony of New South Wales.\"[61] In dedicating his work to\r\nThomas Townsend, Viscount Sydney, Collins ascribes the establishment of\r\nthe colony to that nobleman. \"To your patriotism\" he writes, \"the plan\r\npresented a prospect of political and commercial advantages.\" The facts\r\nrecorded he alleges evinced with how much wisdom the measure was\r\nsuggested and conducted; with what beneficial effects its progress had\r\nbeen attended, and what future benefits the parent country might with\r\nconfidence anticipate. It was expected by Collins, that the colony would\r\nprove a valuable nursery for soldiers and seamen.\r\n\r\nThe territorial seal provided by the crown, stamped on the instruments\r\nof government the primary design: on the obverse, the royal arms and\r\ntitle; but on the reverse, convicts were represented landing, received\r\nby Industry, who, surrounded by her attributes--a bale of merchandise, a\r\npick-axe and shovel--released them from their fetters, and pointed them\r\nto oxen ploughing. The legend was appropriate: \"_Sic fortis Etruria\r\ncrevit_.\"[62]\r\n\r\n\"He who lives among a civilised people, may estimate the labor by which\r\nsociety has been brought into such a state, by reading in the annals of\r\nBotany Bay, the account of a whole nation exerting itself to floor the\r\ngovernment-house. Yet time shall come, when some Botany Bay Tacitus\r\nshall record the crimes of an emperor lineally descended from a London\r\npickpocket.\"[63]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Introduction to _Phillip's Voyages_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: _Bentham's Works_, part iii. p. 122.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: _Bentham's Works_, part iii. p. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _London, in the Eighteenth Century, by Charles Knight._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: A bill was brought into parliament by Mr. Bennet: it was,\r\nhowever, maintained that the total abolition of such rewards would be\r\npernicious.

The letters they addressed to their friends, while the fleet lay\r\nat anchor, were examined by the officers: they were filled with\r\nlamentations. They deeply deplored, that the distance of their exile cut\r\noff the hope of return; the perils of so long a voyage alone seemed\r\nfrightful: should they reach the shores of New Holland, they expected to\r\nbe destroyed by savages, or to pine away in want. The females seemed\r\nleast to fear their banishment; and while several of the men were deeply\r\nmoved, a spectator, who curiously remarked the mental influence of their\r\nprospects, saw only one woman weep.[64]\r\n\r\nWhen the ocean had often been traversed by convict ships, these vague\r\nterrors declined; but the order, comfort, and security which now\r\nprevail, were little known. The freight was of such importance, that the\r\nmasters were tempted to defraud the prisoners of water, and even of\r\nfood; confiding in their means to silence or compensate the sufferers,\r\nwhen in sight of port, or to satisfy the government. So slightly\r\nconsidered was this species of fraud, or so useful to colonial traders,\r\nthat the magistrates held the payment of a gratuity to be a bar to\r\nfurther inquiry.[65] The convicts were thus exposed to severe, and even\r\ndangerous privations. Scurvy, a malady often in those days fatal to half\r\na ship's crew, broke down the strength of men emaciated, dispirited, and\r\ndiseased: many perished by the way, and a much larger number arrived\r\nunfit for labor, and a public burden.\r\n\r\nThe management of a convict ship legally vested in the captain: his duty\r\ncontemplating nothing more than a safe arrival. The personal government\r\nof the prisoners was confided to the surgeon, subject however to the\r\ndiscipline of the ship, of which the captain was exclusive judge. The\r\nhealth of the company was often sacrificed to the security of the\r\nvessel: the prisoners suspected of piratical intentions, were battened\r\ndown and forbidden exercise, lest they should rise upon the crew. From\r\nthe first, the officers in charge claimed a right to inflict corporal\r\npunishment; but, up to 1823, without the sanction of law. By the act\r\nthen passed, power to order punishment was confided to the\r\nsurgeon-superintendent, with the concurrence of the captain; who was\r\nintrusted with a veto, and was bound to enter his assent in the\r\nlog-book, with the nature of the offence and extent of the\r\ninfliction.[66]\r\n\r\nApprehensions of mutiny were much more common, when transportation to\r\nNew Holland was recent, than experience has justified. On the slightest\r\nalarm, the prisoners were loaded with chains, fastened to ring-bolts\r\nattached to the ship's sides. Perhaps, no vessel ever crossed the Line\r\nwithout some plot, rumoured or real; but the most ordinary precautions\r\nhave been found usually sufficient to detect and explode them: their\r\ninventors have often been their discoverers. The prisoners, commonly\r\ndistrustful of each other, shrank from the confidence required to plan\r\nand execute a revolt. But when timid officers were in charge, they\r\nsometimes adopted restrictions severely oppressive; and which men of\r\nmore courage and experience perceive to be needless.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, the deportation of prisoners was attended with special\r\ndifficulties: no ship's company were less likely to support the flag of\r\ntheir country. They were often delayed until a convoy could attend them.\r\nThese hindrances were frequent, when this colony was founded. Both male\r\nand female prisoners were commonly forwarded together: the officers and\r\nsoldiers selected companions for the voyage, and a sentence of\r\ntransportation included prostitution. It is not incredible that modest\r\nwomen rejected life on such terms, or preferred a public execution to\r\nthe ignominy of a floating brothel. These practices were first\r\ntolerated as inevitable, and afterwards justified as politic. No\r\nconspiracy could be concealed, while the women were paramours and spies;\r\nand, when long detained, the population of the ship considerably\r\naugmented before she dropped anchor. The government of the vessel was\r\nnot less severe than its aspect was licentious.[67]\r\n\r\nThus the abuses which, during the war, penetrated every branch of public\r\nbusiness, rioted in the convict ship; whilst the contractors, who\r\nengaged to convey the prisoners at a price, snatched a profit from the\r\nsubsistence stipulated by the crown. Malignant fevers, brought from the\r\nhulks or prisons, propagated in the stagnant atmosphere, and, when\r\ncombined with low and crude diet, more than decimated the list. These\r\neffects of official negligence were early apparent. The second fleet\r\nlost nearly one-fifth of the whole, either on the voyage, or shortly\r\nafter the arrival. Of the previous expedition, the loss was\r\ntrifling.[68] It was fitted out with integrity, surpassing the custom of\r\nthe times, or the pioneers of the colony might have perished on a barren\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nCaptain Parker, of H. M. S. _Gordon_, detected this peculation: he\r\ntraced the unusual mortality to the frauds of the officers, whose\r\nsubduction from the standard allowance had \"starved the prisoners to\r\ndeath;\" but it was not till many years after, that the humanity of\r\nministers interposed effectual regulations. The numbers who perished on\r\nboard the _General Hewitt_, the _Surry_, and the _Three Bees_ in 1814,\r\nforced the attention of the local government to the subject; and on the\r\nreport of Surgeon Redfern, great improvements were adopted.[69] The\r\ndispatch of vessels without regard to the season, brought the prisoners\r\nwithin the cold latitudes, and exposed them to the southern winds in the\r\nwinter; and thinly clad, and enervated by the heat of the tropics, they\r\nwere crowded below, or shivering on the deck. A supply of warm clothing,\r\nand the choice of the proper period of sailing, greatly mitigated the\r\nvoyage; and the constant examination of the diet, samples of which were\r\npreserved, checked the avarice which cost so many lives, and had thus\r\nled to atrocious crimes. It is humiliating to find, at every step, the\r\ntraces of wrong: the comforts supplied the prisoners by their friends,\r\nwere often stolen by the seamen: the pledges lodged in their hands were\r\nnot restored: boxes were pillaged, and the trifles furnished by the\r\nself-sacrifice of a broken-hearted parent, became the spoil of the\r\nassignees of public vengeance. These evils were aggravated by the delay\r\nof the voyage, to subserve the commercial speculations of the surgeons,\r\nwho, beyond the general gains of merchandise, were allowed a large\r\nremission of the customs.\r\n\r\nDr. Bromley, who superintended the transit of prisoners on several\r\noccasions during the first quarter of the century, availed himself\r\nlargely of these trading privileges. Thus he landed, free of duty, at\r\nthe close of one voyage, 150 gallons of spirits, one hogshead of wine,\r\nand ten baskets of tobacco, beside a shipload of women. This profitable\r\nform of investment excited no local complaint, and implied no disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe female convict ships continued under the same system of management,\r\nuntil some flagrant instances induced the Board of Admiralty to check\r\nthe grossness of vice. Of vessels remembered for their pollution, the\r\n_Friendship_ and _Janus_ are distinguished: the keys of the prison were\r\naccessible during the night: the conspiracy reached from the cabin to\r\nforecastle: the officers were libertines themselves, or, even when their\r\nconduct was least equivocal, it was difficult to obstruct\r\nirregularities: not even bars and bolts resisted the ingress of\r\nforbidden guests. The wooden barriers, which covered the entrance, were\r\ndisplaced by some traitress within, who left no protection to her\r\ncompanions but the point of honor.\r\n\r\nThe first who improved the discipline of the convict ships, were Captain\r\nBrown and Dr. Reed, of the _Morley_: they endeavoured, by precept and\r\nexample, to inculcate morality. Coercion had been found ineffectual, and\r\nthe women, when restricted, filled the vessel with clamour and\r\nprofaneness; but these gentlemen adopted a system of mental influence,\r\nand their prisoners, whatever was their subsequent conduct, were far\r\nsuperior to their predecessors. The result of this instance led to a\r\npermanent amelioration, and proved what had hitherto been doubted--that\r\neven the worst societies can be controlled, by those who unite a sense\r\nof virtue with official authority.[70]\r\n\r\nThe safety ascribed to the system of prostitution, was but an apology\r\nfor vice, and the voyage of the _Jane Shore_ dissolved the illusion. The\r\npersuasion of the women accomplished what the male prisoners rarely\r\nattempted, and when on their passage to the colonies have never been\r\nable to effect. The soldiers and sailors, seduced by their caresses,\r\nseized the vessel, and having shot the captain and the chief officer,\r\nsteered into a South American port. Once only, did a piratical plot\r\nassume a serious form. The prisoners by the _Chapman_ devised a capture;\r\nbut the report of the design being communicated, the guard was prepared\r\nfor resistance. A deadly fire covered the deck with carnage: several\r\nwere precipitated into the sea. The sanguinary conflict, which might\r\nhave been prevented by timely precautions, obtained for the _Chapman_\r\nthe popular prefix by which it is distinguished.[71] On one occasion, a\r\nvessel was in imminent danger, through the foolish incaution of the\r\nguard. It was the custom to discharge the fire-arms at sunrise, and to\r\nload them at noon: the interval seemed to offer the fairest prospect of\r\nsuccess, and the prisoners extensively joined in the conspiracy; but\r\nthey were overheard in conversation by a soldier standing at the\r\nhatchway: the ringleaders were seized, and the plot defeated.\r\n\r\nDuring the shorter voyages, from port to port, such accidents have been\r\nmuch more common, although rarely successful. Knatchbull, a relative of\r\nthe eminent Kentish family, and formerly an officer in the navy, enticed\r\nhis fellow prisoners to attempt the capture of the vessel which conveyed\r\nthem: but his device, to poison all but the conspirators with arsenic,\r\nwas denounced.[72]\r\n\r\nThe prisoners sent down from Sydney to Van Diemen's Land, were conveyed\r\nin small crafts and small numbers, and without much regard to their\r\nhealth; but as an example of wretchedness, nothing could exceed the\r\nusual passage from Hobart Town to Macquarie Harbour. The unhappy men,\r\noften destitute of clothing, were placed in the hold of a vessel,\r\nwithout bedding or blankets, and were exposed, sometimes for five or six\r\nweeks, to the chills of a wintry voyage: on one such, there were\r\nthirty-five men, who had but four blankets among them; and one was found\r\nwithout any other covering than his shirt, in which plight he had been\r\nforwarded from the gaol.[73]\r\n\r\nThe surgeon-superintendent enters on his office at the same moment with\r\nthe guard: his duties are multiform--the magistrate, the chaplain, the\r\nmentor, and the physician. The surgeons are usually popular with the\r\nprisoners, and the penal administration with which they are entrusted,\r\nis generally the most disguised. Educated men, they are not commonly\r\nhaughty and capricious: they are able to distinguish moral imbecility\r\nfrom perverseness, and both from disease. The habit of scrutinising\r\nquickens their sagacity, and fits them for a station, where the\r\nknowledge of the heart is the great secret of control. Accustomed to\r\nbehold human nature, stript of all its external trappings, the grade of\r\nthe prisoner, in their estimation, does not wholly debase the man.\r\nWitnesses to the wretchedness of humble life, the squalor of its garrets\r\nand its cellars--observant that want, which sometimes forms the felon,\r\nmuch oftener makes the martyr, and crowds the hospital rather than the\r\ngaol--they are not incapable of pitying either class of victims. The\r\nhorrors which others feel for disease, whether of the body or the mind,\r\nexcite no antipathies in men who have devoted their lives to its relief:\r\nthus their government of convicts often affords a singular contrast to\r\nthe agency which precedes or follows them. The recollection of their\r\nconduct is mentioned by the prisoner with respect, and even with\r\nfondness. No profession can better prepare for practical benevolence:\r\nwhat it withdraws from the sensibility it adds to the understanding; and\r\nthose in charge of convict vessels have exhibited, in full average, the\r\nvirtues of their profession.[74]\r\n\r\nWhen physical suffering became infrequent, and the arrangements secured\r\nboth convenience and comfort during the voyage, it was long ere moral\r\ncontrol, or a reformatory discipline, became objects of concern. A\r\nsurgeon,[75] employed from 1818, amused the public with the details of\r\nhis system of management--not wanting in humanity. He encouraged a\r\njoyous indifference to the past or the future: the prisoners sang from\r\nmorning to night, and often spent the evenings in dancing. The greatest\r\ncriminals were selected on principle for offices of trust, as far the\r\nmost trusty! The discourse was licentious--the feats of thievery, the\r\nchosen topics of amusement and conversation. A stage, decked out with\r\nthe remains of former spoil, exhibited \"the forty thieves,\" or a comedy\r\nof judges, officers, and felons: mock charges were enforced by\r\nbarristers, arrayed in blankets; the bench was filled with an actor\r\ndecorated with a quilt, while a swab covered his head, and descended to\r\nhis shoulders. In the female prison ships, dancing and concerts, at\r\nwhich the cabin passengers were spectators, whiled away the voyage. The\r\ngross immoralities of a former period had subsided when he wrote: he\r\nmentioned the change with regret. A free intercourse, he thought, more\r\nconducive to reformation, as well as to harmony: the attachment formed\r\nby the women, softened their demeanor, and facilitated their control.\r\nSuch were his views, and they had many partisans: but in connection we\r\nlearn, without astonishment, that he thought contemptuously of\r\nsaintship, considered reformation utopian, and honesty rather the result\r\nof habit than of principle; the convicts, more unfortunate in their\r\ndetection than peculiar in their crimes: capable of the devotion of\r\nhypocrites; hardly of repentance. The dash of libertinism which sparkles\r\nin the pages of this writer, fell in with the humour of the day, and the\r\nwork was popular. It greatly tended, notwithstanding its levity, to\r\nchange the character of penal discipline in the colonies.[76]\r\n\r\nThe discipline of a convict vessel, as administered by\r\nSurgeon-superintendent Browning, exhibited a different scene, and was\r\ncarried out in another spirit. The devout character of his mind, his\r\nconfiding disposition, and boundless good-will, are well known in these\r\ncolonies; and his management has been regarded with great admiration,\r\nor great contempt. His high valuation of human nature contrasted with\r\nthe common official estimate: he not only saw fellow men in the worst\r\nprisoners, but practicable materials, which knowledge and judgment might\r\nform into comparative moral excellence. The plan of his government\r\nrecognised a wide distribution of oversight and responsibility: the\r\nnames by which he distinguished those whom he employed were flattering:\r\nthey were not gaolers and turnkeys, but captains of divisions and\r\ndelegates. He delivered lectures upon geography and astronomy: those who\r\ncould play instruments, such as clarionet, fife, and violin, were\r\nstationed on the deck, while the rest marched in ranks. He instituted a\r\ncourt of enquiry, consisting of five persons, of which his clerk was the\r\nrecorder, who examined witnesses, and disposed of trivial offences, by\r\nexhortation, warning, and reproof; and in more flagrant cases, these\r\npreliminary inquiries formed the basis of his own adjudication. He\r\ntreated the prisoners as persons sequestered from society for their own\r\ngood. He has shewn, by tables, that those who acquired a knowledge of\r\nreading under his instruction, often indeed imperfect, formed a large\r\nproportion of the whole.[77] His addresses exhibit the ardour of his\r\ncharacter: most critics would discern a tinge of enthusiasm; which,\r\nhowever, is common to all, who successfully attempt the reformation of\r\nmankind. Under such a guardian, it may be imagined, that the physical\r\nwelfare of the prisoners was carefully superintended. Medical comforts\r\nwere distributed with great liberality: flogging was wholly disused.\r\nMoral influence, assisted by occasional deprivation of food or liberty,\r\ncomprehended the agency he employed. The systems of Browning and\r\nCunningham, though contemplating the same general objects, were\r\nsingularly adverse; and in nothing did they differ more pointedly than\r\ntheir estimate of the substrata of convict character, the influence of\r\nreligious instruction, and the usefulness of the _cat_. Dr. Browning was\r\nsubject to much imposition--a liability which meets every aspect of\r\npractical benevolence; but that he preserved order and health,\r\ndiscouraged blasphemy, provided for the occupation of time, and\r\nprevented gambling and peculation--that he sheltered the well-disposed\r\nfrom the violence and contamination of the worst--and that he parted\r\nwith his charge, with their ideas increased and their moral sensibility\r\nawakened--is, with all deductions, a claim to no trifling praise.\r\nColonel Arthur, a keen observer, mentioned the general emotion which\r\nseparation occasioned: the prisoners heard his valedictory address with\r\ntenderness and reverence, and melted into tears.[78] To reproach his\r\nlabors would be a sin against mankind; but an over-estimate of their\r\neffect, diminished the moral weight of their example. \"Dr. Browning's\r\npets\" became marked men; their conduct was watched with curiosity, often\r\nwith ill-will, and their lapses were reckoned up with exultation.\r\n\r\nThe ample provision for the accommodation, exercise, and food of the\r\nprisoners, has been of late years a topic of complaint. They require\r\nmore care, and a diet more nicely chosen, than laborers in health and\r\nmental tranquillity. Efforts to reduce these comforts have been followed\r\nby fever and physical prostration; and whatever aspect their treatment\r\nmay wear, those who deprive them of liberty are bound to provide for\r\ntheir safety. The law sentences to transportation: no question of public\r\npolicy could justify a minister, when converting that penalty into a\r\nsentence of death.[79]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the length of the voyage, the navigation of convict\r\nvessels has been fortunate: for thirty years no vessel had been lost.\r\nThe merchant ships met with the average of accidents; but the transports\r\nwere supposed, by the curious, to be under a peculiar destiny. They\r\nattributed their safe passage to the force of the proverb, which implies\r\nthat the trident of Neptune is powerless against the heritage of the\r\nexecutioner.\r\n\r\nA succession of calamities, in the navigation of convict vessels,\r\nchanged the aspect of their fortune, and filled all classes with\r\ncommiseration: such was the wreck of the _Amphitrite_, in 1833, which\r\nstruck on the coast of Bologne. That vessel was in a position of great\r\ndanger, and the French pilot, Heuret, endeavoured to warn, in time to\r\nsave; but the risk of the usual reward, it is said, the surgeon was\r\nunwilling to incur; and the captain, not less indisposed to forfeit his\r\nbond, which included a penalty for every prisoner who might escape.\r\nTheir hesitation was fatal to themselves: the women were not permitted\r\nto come on deck, or to avail themselves of the opportunity to save their\r\nlives. These unfortunate females, to the number of 103, with their\r\nchildren, were drowned; and their naked corpses, floating to the coast\r\nof France, exhibited an appalling spectacle. The French and English\r\nmingled their tears, as they beheld the bodies strewed along the\r\nbeach--some models of feminine beauty, others disfigured by the recent\r\nconcussions; among the rest, a young mother, with her child clasped in\r\nher arms. Nor does it appear that the instructions of the government had\r\never foreseen or provided for such dangers, or authorised the temporary\r\nrelease of prisoners, when the situation of the ship might require their\r\nliberation.\r\n\r\nThe wreck of the _George the Third_, in April, 1835, excited the most\r\npainful sensations. Having fifty-three persons on the sick list,\r\noccasioned by a deficiency of proper food, Captain Moxley endeavoured to\r\nreach Hobart Town through D'Entrecasteaux's Channel: while running at an\r\neasy rate, and in smooth water, the leadsman cried out, \"a quarter less\r\nfour:\" that instant the vessel struck; at first gently, then heavily,\r\nand in less than ten minutes she was a perfect wreck. The prisoners were\r\nbelow, imploring release: they rushed to the hatchway, where a\r\ncorporal's guard was armed to repress them: they forced through the\r\nbars, and a few were seen to escape; the soldiers, ordered to resist\r\ntheir egress, then fired. The waters rushing into the hold of the vessel\r\ndrowned the sick, and reached the knees of the convicts, who were\r\nascending the hatchway; and Major Ryan, and the surgeon-superintendent,\r\nexpected instant death. They succeeded in sending the long-boat on\r\nshore, amidst the cheers of the prisoners. Assistance was afforded by\r\nthe _Louisa_ schooner; and a party dispatched in the cutter, obtained\r\nhelp from Hobart Town: but of two hundred and twenty, one hundred and\r\nthirty-three perished. The fate of the convicts who fell at the\r\nhatchway, excited great commiseration and some complaint: the officers\r\ndisclaimed the order to fire--an act which could only be excused by the\r\ndanger to the whole company in a rush to the boat. A board of inquiry\r\nacquitted all parties of blame.\r\n\r\nOne man, only, was found on the wreck; an aged prisoner, on his passage\r\nto the colony under his third sentence of transportation: unable to face\r\nthe surf, he lashed himself to a ring attached to the hull, and there\r\nclosed his career of crime.\r\n\r\nA disaster, not less appalling, occurred off King's Island, by the wreck\r\nof the _Neva_, in May, 1835, at 4 o'clock in the morning: she struck\r\nupon the rocks, swung on the reef, and admitted the sea. The pinnace was\r\nlowered, and the prison being broken by the shock, the unfortunate women\r\nrushed on the deck; they filled the boat, which was instantly swamped,\r\nand all, except three seamen, perished. The long-boat was then carefully\r\nladen; but being upset by the surf, all sunk, except the master and\r\nchief officer: these having regained the ship, she parted; and the\r\nwomen, aroused from their beds in the twilight of a wintry morning,\r\nclung shivering to the fragments. Their cries of suffering and anguish\r\nwere soon hushed, and of two hundred and forty, a few moments before\r\nslumbering in tranquillity, twenty-two only were borne on broken pieces\r\nof the ship to land; of these, seven died from exhaustion, and the\r\nremainder must have perished, but for the intrepid exertions of Mr.\r\nCharles Friend, who caught sight of their signals when passing the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nTwo women disputed about the position of the vessel: exasperated by\r\ncontradiction, they were tearing each other by the hair, when a wave\r\nswept them from the deck into eternity.\r\n\r\nThe wreck of the _Governor Phillip_, in 1848, was the last instance of\r\nsuch disasters. The vessel struck on a sand bank off Cape Barren Island;\r\nbut, except four, all the prisoners were saved: six soldiers and five\r\nseamen perished, with Lieutenant Griffiths, the officer in command--a\r\nyoung gentleman of amiable disposition and great promise. He exhibited a\r\nbrilliant example of humanity, calmness, and self devotion. The\r\nprisoners broke from their quarters, rushed on the deck, and obstructed\r\nthe exertions of the seamen: entreating them to return, he gave them\r\n_his hand_ and his word, that he would not desert the vessel until they\r\nwere clear of the wreck. While some were conveyed to the shore, he\r\nremained knocking off the irons of the rest; and then finding the boat\r\ncould not regain the ship, he plunged into the sea, and was last seen\r\nstruggling with the current. The risk of life is common to the military\r\nprofession; but a sacrifice so nobly made, was surely not less glorious\r\nthan when on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Sidney Smith: _Edinburgh Review_, 1803.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: _Tench's Narrative_, 1789.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: _Bigge's Report._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: This act (4 Geo. iv.) of 1823, made the punishments\r\nlegally inflicted by the overseers on board the hulks, the rule on board\r\nthe transports; but 5 Will. iv. allows such punishments as may be\r\n_authorised by the secretary of state_, without specifying their nature.\r\nThe penalty of L20 (previously L50), for not entering the punishment in\r\nthe log-book, is in itself a feeble protection against the abuses which\r\nsuch powers might produce. The instructions of the secretary of state to\r\nthe surgeon-superintendent direct--to confine in a dark cell; to lessen\r\nthe ration, even to bread and water; and whipping: first \"using mild and\r\npersuasive means.\" It is proper to observe, that these powers are very\r\nrarely abused: punishments are not to be inflicted, except in the\r\npresence of at least twelve prisoners.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: \"The captain and each officer enjoy the right of\r\nselection.

Occasionally, however, they range into the quarter\r\nassigned to the women. The males, accustomed in London to indiscriminate\r\nlicense, discover the greatest regret at the restraint of their passions\r\nin the grossest oaths, and in the grossest language. The females, who\r\nrather resemble the brutes than rational creatures in their excesses,\r\nanswer their reproaches, and rage with equal effrontery, and unbounded\r\nimpudence. It is a scene like Pandemonium--a second hell, but upon the\r\nocean. Sitting in groups, they sing, they shout, they converse in the\r\ngrossest terms, corrupting, and corrupted. The concubine knits, or sews\r\nfor her sailor, near his berth: the rest wash the clothes of the male\r\nconvicts; exercise and cleanliness, conducive to their health and to the\r\ncomforts of the ship. Many are remarkably neat: all are clad in\r\ndifferent dresses--some have been enabled to purchase caps, more have\r\nnot. The males are clothed in simple uniformity, in blue trousers and a\r\njacket. All the convicts are compelled to wash once in the day their\r\nheads, their feet, and their faces; the men under the superintendence of\r\na soldier, the women apart under the eye of a matron. The males are\r\nmarched in a body of six across the deck to the pump: the sailors draw\r\nup the water, and they are artfully compelled to labor for health at the\r\npump, and to rinse away the dirt. By this prudent precaution, in every\r\nvariety of weather, they obtain fresh air and avoid the scurvy, or\r\ncutaneous diseases. A surgeon daily inspects this _human cargo_, and\r\nreports its _state_. They are paid per head, a sum for those who survive\r\nthe voyage; hence it is the surgeon's interest to preserve these\r\ndiseased wretches. To inure this assembly, disgorged from brothels, and\r\ncellars, and gaols, to the _appearance_, or to the idea of decorum, the\r\nmen wash their bodies above decks, and the women between them. The sexes\r\nare forbid to mingle, even at their meals. So rigorous a discipline is\r\nonly supported by severity of punishments. Chains, tied round the body\r\nand fettered round the ankles, confine and distress each male convict,\r\nby the clanking sound, and by annoying the feet. This image of slavery\r\nis copied from the irons used in the slave-ships in Guinea: as in these,\r\nbolts and locks are at hand, in the sides and ribs of each _transport_\r\n(for the vessels _on this service_, with _peculiar_ propriety are so\r\nnamed), to prevent the escape, or preclude the movements of a convict.\r\nIf he attempt to pass the sentry, he is liable to be stabbed: for the\r\nattempt, a convict was lately shot, and his executioner was applauded by\r\nhis officer for a faithful, though severe, discharge of duty. If a felon\r\nkill his companion, a case very frequent in the quarrels of these\r\nhighwaymen and robbers, the murderer is hung at the yard-arm, and his\r\nbody is slowly carried through the ship, and launched into the deep. For\r\nthe theft of provisions, or of clothes from his neighbour, a case yet\r\nmore common, and more natural to footpads, the convict depredator is\r\nshot. For inferior crimes, as riot or quarrels, a soldier is commanded\r\nto whip the offender with martial severity: the first stroke leaves a\r\ndeep impression of the wire, the second causes the blood to trickle, the\r\nthird draws a stream of gore: under several faintings, the debilitated\r\nand disordered convict receives two dozen of lashes. On the slightest\r\nappearance of a mutiny, the ring-leader is cast headlong into the sea,\r\nin his irons and his clothes. We commit this body to the deep, the\r\nchaplain repeals, but the words of Shakespeare, perhaps, would be more\r\napplicable:--\r\n\r\n'O mutineer! if thou hast any hope of heaven's bliss,\r\nLift up thy hand; make signal of that hope.\r\nHe sinks! and makes no sign.'\"\r\n--_Account, by Captain Bertram_, in 1800: Longman.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: New South Wales first fleet, 987 convicts; of which 25\r\ndied, or 1 in 35.

To rid\r\nthe parent state of an encumbrance, was alone the immediate object of\r\nthe government: all beyond was surrendered to fate. The absorbing\r\nagitation of Europe, then filled with wars and revolutions, diverted the\r\npublic gaze from a distant experiment, and left to local discretion the\r\ndetails of its working. The difficulties of this extempore system were\r\nreally great: that competition for penal labor, which afterwards made\r\nits distribution a boon, had no existence; the social influence of a\r\nstrong body of settlers, habituated to industry, and expecting opulence\r\nas its reward, was an auxiliary unknown. Political economy, as a\r\npractical science, was lightly esteemed: the choice of instruments to\r\neffect a royal purpose, rarely determined by their specific\r\nqualifications. The first rulers of these colonies were, indeed, men of\r\nliterary pretensions; several, of extensive nautical experience: trained\r\non the quarter deck in the discipline of war, when royal ships were\r\noften scenes of great courage, and of equal despotism and\r\ndebasement--when seamen were taken from the dock, impressed from the\r\ntrader, and even stolen on the streets. Taught to govern a crew, they\r\nwere judged by the ministry exactly qualified to coerce and control a\r\nbody of prisoners. There were some advantages in this choice: they were\r\nmen who knew how to subject the will of masses; their fearless temper\r\nfelt no dread of those wild and lawless spirits surrendered to their\r\npower. They could transfer the system of the navy to the shore: they\r\nwere not intimidated by hardships, and they were accustomed to\r\nprivations: perhaps, no other profession could have furnished\r\nadventurers, on the whole, so well qualified for their task.\r\n\r\nBut in planting a colony, tillage is the first element of success; of\r\nthis, they knew nothing: they could destroy a fort, or erect a tent;\r\nbut to subdue the earth to the plough, or to construct a town, required\r\nanother education. They gave, and long preserved, to the site of the\r\ncity, the name of _camp_: thus the first efforts at cultivation were\r\nunfortunate: they had passed two years in New Holland, scratching up the\r\nearth with hoes, and ought to have gathered a harvest, when they were on\r\nthe verge of starvation.[80]\r\n\r\nAmong the thousand persons landed, not one could be found possessing a\r\nknowledge of agriculture.[81] What they did not know, they could not\r\nteach. The misapplication of labor was prodigious: they acquired the art\r\nof cultivation by the slow process of experiment; and thus they came to\r\na conclusion, only lately obsolete--that an Australasian husbandman is\r\nspoiled by the agricultural knowledge of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe immediate direction of labor, from the beginning, was committed to\r\nconvicts. To stand over the prisoners, was not an agreeable occupation\r\nfor gentlemen: thus the actual working of transportation, as a penal\r\nsystem, was entrusted to men, often clever and corrupt, whose brutal\r\nhabits and savage demeanour excited disgust and fear. This error\r\nperpetuated itself: persons of character rejected a position, so often\r\noccupied by the worthless: even the distribution of labor was entrusted\r\nto such hands, or subject to their influence. To the prisoners, in\r\nreality, they sold indulgences of the crown, or exacted a revenue from\r\ntheir vices. The chief superintendent of convicts at Sydney, and who\r\nlong determined what men should be dispatched to this country, was\r\nhimself doubly convicted.[82] This was far from destroying eligibility:\r\nit became at last an official proverb, that bad men, from the very vices\r\nof their character, were the fittest for a direct supervision; and,\r\nfinally, that the world is divided between the rogue and the fool. The\r\nuse of power, when entrusted to such hands, is no problem; nor is it\r\npossible to imagine greater degradation, or punishment more capricious,\r\nthan of the unfortunate person subject to such taskmasters; in whose\r\nhands, according to the custom of early times, the rod of authority was\r\nnot a metaphor.[83]\r\n\r\nThat form of service, known as assignment, was established by Governor\r\nKing in 1804. The master was bound by indenture to retain his servant\r\nfor one year, and for every day deficient, a penalty of one shilling was\r\nimposed: the quantity of the work to be done was prescribed; contingent,\r\nhowever, on the nature of the soil, the state of the weather, and the\r\nstrength of the workman: the surplus of his time might be occupied by\r\nthe master, but his earnings were his own. Wages were L10 per annum, and\r\nfor a female L7; but the deficiency of money, induced the employers to\r\nallot a proportion of time as a compensation, or to supply goods, on\r\nwhich an advance was claimed, often extremely oppressive; and when the\r\nseason rendered servants less useful, the masters were tempted to obtain\r\nrelief by false accusations, or to allow their men to quit the\r\npremises--who sought, by labor or theft, the means of subsistence.\r\n\r\nTo restrict the habit of change, Macquarie established the rule that no\r\nconvict should be returnable, except for infirmity, sickness, or crime;\r\nbut when the supply exceeded the demand, this condition was evaded, and\r\nthe result--an accumulation in the hands of the government. A large\r\nproportion were from the manufacturing districts of Great Britain: they\r\nwere utterly ignorant of farming, and when the plough superceded the\r\nhoe, they required a tedious training before they repaid the expense of\r\ntheir support.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture of this colony was long trifling: the convicts were\r\nchiefly employed as stockmen and shepherds: from the banks of the\r\nDerwent to the district of Launceston, the land in general was a\r\nwilderness, unfenced and untenanted: the men, stationed forty and fifty\r\nmiles from their masters' dwellings, were rarely visited, and were under\r\nno immediate control. They were armed, to defend themselves from the\r\nnatives, and clad in skins: they lived in turf huts, thatched with long\r\ngrass, and revived the example of savage life.[84]\r\n\r\nIt was the custom to allot to the superior officers, magistrates, and\r\nconstables, in proportion to their rank, a certain number of men, who\r\nwere subsisted from the king's stores. A skilful mechanic, or pedlar,\r\nwas a valuable acquisition: he hired his own time, and paid from 5s. to\r\nL1, according to its estimated weekly value, while the master drew, for\r\nhis own use, the rations of the servant. Others rented farms, and paid\r\ntheir masters in produce; and when \"government men,\" as assigned\r\nservants were called, were unable to obtain payment, and thus failed to\r\nmake good an engagement with the master, they were liable to be thrown\r\nback into their former position.\r\n\r\nTickets-of-leave were freely given to those incapable of much service to\r\nthe government, or its officers: such as were useful, whatever might be\r\ntheir conduct, were long detained, and for a period often indefinite.\r\nFemales, who arrived with property, were discharged to enjoy it. If\r\nfollowed by the husband, the wife was instantly assigned to his care. To\r\nenable a prisoner to support his wife when she joined him, or when a\r\nconvict married a convict, if of no special value he was released to\r\nlabor for himself.\r\n\r\nNo accurate account was preserved of these distributions, and a notice\r\nappeared during the government of Sorell, which required all women\r\nliving at large to give an account of the grounds on which they\r\npretended to freedom, or otherwise to obtain a regular ticket-of-leave.\r\n\r\nUnder a system so irregular, great practical injustice was occasionally\r\ninflicted: while advantages were enjoyed by artisans, who could hire\r\ntheir time; who obtained large profits from their trade, and indulged in\r\nevery form of vice and licentiousness.[85]\r\n\r\nAn action in 1821 (Loane _v._ Beamont), for the recovery of a debt\r\nincurred by a prisoner of the crown assigned to the defendant,\r\nillustrated the system which then prevailed. The man in question arrived\r\nin 1813, and in 1816 he was Beamont's government man, who then by verbal\r\nagreement, and afterwards in writing, engaged to sell him a farm, near\r\nHerdsman's Cove, for L1,400, including the stock and implements of\r\nhusbandry. He possessed, besides a sum of money, a considerable flock of\r\nsheep. There was nothing disguised in this transaction: the annual\r\nrental was intended to cover the purchase. The judge remarked, that the\r\nmemorandum \"was as good a sale upon honor as ever he saw.\" The suit was\r\nan instance of the strange perversion of prison discipline, which\r\nhowever excited no remark, and therefore could not be uncommon.\r\n\r\nAt the close of Governor Davey's administration in 1817, the population\r\nof Van Diemen's Land was 3,114, and of these 566 resided in the county\r\nof Cornwall. The convicts were slowly augmented by deportations from\r\nSydney, and they were subject to the absolute will of the officers. It\r\nis in vain to look for systems in a community so small, and separated by\r\nso great a distance from public opinion. Management was lax or rigid,\r\naccording to the temper of the moment; and no object was contemplated by\r\nthose who had power, except to render its exercise subservient to their\r\nprivate views. Previous character had no marked influence in determining\r\nthe lot: a life of crime was no barrier to indulgence, when its price\r\ncould be paid: the early career of the prisoners was generally unknown.\r\nThe discipline was, indeed, often severe: lashes were administered by\r\nhundreds, and crimes or offences, were resented or forgiven, not\r\naccording to rule, but circumstances. There were, however, gradations of\r\npenal banishment: as at Sydney, those separated to special punishment,\r\nwere sent to Hobart Town; such as were still further implicated were\r\nforwarded to Launceston; but the dregs of all settled at George Town.\r\nWhat was the character of the inhabitants of that place, may be inferred\r\nfrom the Commissioner's Reports. Prisoners, male and female, living in\r\nskillings, the commandant disobeying the orders of his chief, inferior\r\nofficers exhibiting flagrant immorality; labor compensated by the\r\ngovernment in a currency of rum; sold by abandoned women--who were often\r\nthe depositories of stolen goods passed from Hobart Town and Launceston.\r\nSuch was George Town at, and for some time after, this era.\r\n\r\nThe charges against the prisoners, were such as result from slavery and\r\ndebasement. All crimes, of less magnitude than murder, or burglary under\r\naggravated circumstances, were punished in a summary manner. To\r\nprosecute, was to encounter ruin: the person despoiled, while pursuing\r\nthe robber, lost the remnant of his property; and, returning to his\r\ndwelling, found it wrecked and pillaged. Mechanics, and others entitled\r\nto money, were paid in rum, and its prompt consumption was the only\r\nmeans to secure its enjoyment. Those who earned considerable sums, were\r\nrarely richer than their neighbours.\r\n\r\nWhile Governor Collins lived, some order was maintained: it was during\r\nthe rule of his successor that the British standard covered a state of\r\nsociety, such as never before possessed the official sanction. Once or\r\ntwice a month, this Governor enjoyed a carouse, to which a sea-port, in\r\ntimes of war, might furnish an example. Having selected a station, not\r\nfar from the town, he provided for the feast: the more talented of the\r\nconvicts surrounded the tent, and enlivened the entertainment with\r\nsongs. Rum, in large quantities, loaded the board: first the chiefs, and\r\nthen their retainers, revelled in its overflowing abundance. The gaol\r\ngang, warned by his Honor's steward of the direction the guests had\r\ntaken, sometimes followed after the jovial ruler; and when the moon\r\narose, the Governor and his attendants, of various grades, might be seen\r\nwinding home together. A number of settlers, whom he had offended,\r\nrefused an invitation: when time had obliterated their resentment, he\r\ninvited them again: the table was covered, and the guests were seated;\r\nbut at that moment, the gaol gang, facetiously called the Governor's\r\nband, and who were posted near the spot for the purpose, burst into the\r\nchamber, and swept away all the provisions. The Governor pretended to\r\nregret this termination; but consoled himself by saying, he could \"get a\r\ndinner at _Stocker's_.\" Such was this trustee of national justice!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: At the period above mentioned, the colony was in imminent\r\ndanger of perishing from famine, in consequence of the non-arrival of\r\nstore ships from England. Captain Tench, in his interesting work on New\r\nSouth Wales, thus describes the situation and feelings of himself and\r\nhis fellow settlers:--\"We had now (that is, in the beginning of 1790)\r\nbeen two years in the country, and thirty-two months from England, in\r\nwhich long period no supplies, except what had been procured from the\r\nCape of Good Hope, had reached us. Famine was approaching with gigantic\r\nstrides, and gloom and dejection overspread every countenance. Still, we\r\nwere on the tiptoe of expectation. If thunder broke at a distance, or a\r\nfowling piece of louder than ordinary report resounded in the woods, '_A\r\ngun from a ship!_' was echoed on every side, and nothing but hurry and\r\nagitation prevailed. As we had removed from Botany Bay to Port Jackson,\r\nit was judged necessary to fix a party of seamen on a high cliff called\r\nSouth Head, at the entrance of the harbour, on which a flag was ordered\r\nto be hoisted whenever a ship might appear, which should serve as a\r\ndirection to her and as a signal of approach to us. Here, on the summit\r\nof a hill, did we sweep the horizon every morning from day-light until\r\nthe sun sunk, in the hope of seeing a sail. At every fleeting speck\r\nwhich arose from the bosom of the ocean, the heart bounded, and the\r\ntelescope was lifted to the eye. If a ship appeared here, we knew that\r\nshe must be bound to us; for on the shore of this vast ocean, the\r\nlargest in the world, we were the only community which possessed the art\r\nof navigation, and languished for intercourse with civilised society. In\r\nMarch, vigorous measures were become necessary. The _Sirius_ was ordered\r\nto prepare for a voyage to China, but she was shortly after wrecked. On\r\nthe 27th of this month, the following order was issued:--'Parole--Honor;\r\ncountersign--Example. The expected supply of provisions not having yet\r\narrived, makes it necessary to reduce the present ration, to render the\r\nmentioned allowance to every person in the settlement without\r\ndistinction. Four pounds of flour, two pounds and a half of pork, and\r\none pound and a half of rice per week.' The flour was afterwards reduced\r\nnearly one half, and the other articles in a less proportion. The pork\r\nhad been salted between three and four years, and every grain of rice\r\nwas a moving body. We soon left off boiling the pork, as it had become\r\nso old and dry, that it shrunk one half. We toasted it before the fire,\r\ncatching the drops which fell on a slice of bread, or in a saucer of\r\nrice. The distress of the lower classes for clothes was almost equal to\r\ntheir other wants. Nothing more ludicrous can be conceived than the\r\nexpedients of substituting, shifting, and patching, which ingenuity\r\ndevised, to eke out wretchedness, and preserve the remains of decency.\r\nNor was another part of our domestic economy less whimsical. If a lucky\r\nman, who had knocked down a dinner with his gun, or caught a fish by\r\nangling, invited a neighbour to dine with him, the invitation ran,\r\n'bring your own bread.' Even at the Governor's table this custom was\r\nconstantly observed. Every man who sat down pulled his bread out of his\r\npocket. In May, the men became much weakened from want, and they were\r\nordered to do only as much work as their strength would permit. Rigorous\r\njustice was executed on persons detected in robbing or pilfering. A\r\nconvict detected in stealing potatoes was ordered to receive 300 lashes,\r\nto be chained for six months to two other criminals, and to have his\r\nallowance of flour stopped for six months. Further, to contribute to the\r\ndetection of villany, a proclamation, offering 60 pounds of flour, more\r\ntempting than the gold of Peru, was promised to any one who should\r\napprehend a robber of garden ground. At length the bonds of misfortune\r\nbegan to separate, and on the evening of June 3rd, the joyful cry of\r\n'_the flag's up!_' resounded in every direction. I was sitting in my\r\nhut, musing on our fate, when a confused clamour drew my attention. I\r\nopened my door, and saw women, with children in their arms, running to\r\nand fro, with distracted looks, congratulating each other, and kissing\r\ntheir infants with the most passionate and extravagant marks of\r\nfondness. I ran to a hill, where, by the assistance of a pocket glass,\r\nmy hopes were realised. A brother officer was with me, but we could not\r\nspeak; we wrang each other by the hand, with eyes and hearts\r\noverflowing. Finding the Governor intended to go immediately in his boat\r\ndown the harbour, I begged to be of his party. As we proceeded, the\r\nobject of our hopes soon appeared--a large ship, with English colors\r\nflying, working in between the heads which form the entrance to the\r\nharbour. The tumultuous state of our minds represented her in danger,\r\nand we were in agony. The weather was wet and tempestuous, but the body\r\nis delicate only when the mind is at ease. We pushed through wind and\r\nrain, the anxiety of our sensations every moment redoubling. At last we\r\nread the word _London_ on her stern. 'Pull away, my lads! she is from\r\nold England! A few strokes more, and we shall be aboard--hurrah for a\r\nbelly full, and news from our friends!' Such were our exhortations to\r\nthe boat's crew. A few minutes completed our wishes, and we found\r\nourselves on board the _Lady Juliana_ transport, with 235 of our\r\ncountrywomen, whom crime or misfortune had condemned to exile. She had\r\nbeen about eleven months on her voyage.\"--_Tench's Narrative._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: _Dr. Lang's History of New South Wales._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: _Bigge's Reports._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: The decision of a magistrate was not necessary, to inflict\r\npunishment. The overseer stalked about with a military cane, and was not\r\nsparing of its use. \"He would walk out behind the convict-hoers in a\r\nmorning gown and morocco slippers, with a _Penang Lawyer_ hugged close\r\nunder his right arm, or borne like a royal sceptre before him, plucking\r\nat every tuft as he paced about, and drumming such a tattoo upon the\r\nshoulders of the unlucky wight, whose ground was not completely chopped,\r\nand grass fairly uprooted, as made the whole brush dance with fire-flies\r\nbefore him!\"--_Cunningham._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: \"The other inhabitants of the island (Britain) still\r\nmaintained themselves by pasture: they were clothed with skins of\r\nbeasts; they dwelt in huts, which they reared in forests and marshes,\r\nwith which the country was covered.\"--_Hume's History of England_, chap.\r\ni.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: \"A little wicked tailor arrives, of no use to the\r\narchitectural projects of the Governor: he is turned over to a settler,\r\nwho leases this sartorial Borgia his liberty for five shillings a week,\r\nand allows him to steal and snip what, when, and where he can.

Some men of milder\r\ndisposition abstained from all active violations of the law, and kept\r\naloof from offenders of a different temper. Of a sailor, who deserted to\r\nthe forest, it is said that he not only refrained from robberies, but\r\noften prevented them: he had carried to his retreat a young woman whom\r\nhe professed to love, and remained for three years in his seclusion. The\r\nromance of this event was, however, extinguished at the close of their\r\nexile: the man grew prosperous, abandoned his faithful companion, and\r\nmarried another.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of 1813, the daring and sanguinary violence of\r\nbushrangers, reduced the colony to the utmost distress: the settlers,\r\ngenerally of the lowest class, received their plunder, and gave them\r\nnotice of pursuit. Their alliance with stock-keepers, who themselves\r\npassed rapidly, and almost naturally, from the margin of civilised to a\r\nlawless life, was well understood: nor could they readily refuse their\r\nfriendship: the government, unable to afford them protection, left them\r\nno other source of safety. The division of the colonists into those who\r\nhad been convicts, and those who controlled them, naturally ranged all\r\nof loose principles on the side of the outlaws. Nor was their mode of\r\nlife without attractions: they were free: their daring seemed like\r\nheroism to those in bondage. They not unfrequently professed to punish\r\nseverity to the prisoners, and like Robin Hood of old, to pillage the\r\nrich, that they might be generous to the poor. The course adopted by\r\nthe government indicated the strength of the robbers: despairing to\r\nreduce them by force, in 1814 Macquarie tendered pardon, except for the\r\ncrime of murder, to those who, within six months, should return to their\r\nduty. To give effect to this treaty, time was judged necessary for its\r\npublication; and to allow for the hesitation of the penitent, a distant\r\nday was appointed for closing the door.\r\n\r\nThis singular document was prepared by his Majesty's judge, who was thus\r\nhimself bound in honor to its unexampled conditions; but the legal\r\nacumen of the robbers soon detected the error: its effect was not only\r\npardon for the past, but, with the exception of murder, a license to\r\nravage the colony until the date expired. Thus, they gathered the\r\nharvest of crime, and continued their depredations to the last. Nor was\r\nanother advantage foreseen, although eagerly embraced by the robbers:\r\nthey almost universally submitted, and having cleared with the law, were\r\nprepared again to abscond, and risk once more the chances of the field;\r\nbut if the document was absurd, the conduct of the local authorities was\r\nnot less impolitic. The removal of men, so well acquainted with the\r\ncolony and its hundred retreats, was an obvious, yet neglected,\r\nprecaution: some were satisfied with their past experience, but others\r\nlost no time in returning to the bush.\r\n\r\nFor several years the settlement suffered the utmost mischief from these\r\nbands of robbers: among those celebrated for daring, for resolute\r\nresistance, and for frequent escapes, Michael Howe, a seaman, obtained\r\nthe largest share of fame. Formerly in the royal navy, and afterwards\r\nowning a small coal craft, he had acquired some notion of order and\r\ncommand. On his arrival in Van Diemen's Land, in 1812, he was assigned\r\nto Mr. Ingle, a merchant and stock-holder; but he had declared, that\r\nhaving served the king, he would be no man's slave, and to cast off the\r\nyoke of such subjection was, perhaps, the main object he contemplated.\r\nSuch was his pretence. Having received the benefit of the amnesty, he\r\nsoon joined a gang, of which one Whitehead was the leader; among whom\r\nwas a deserter of the 73rd regiment, and two aboriginal women. The\r\nsettlers of New Norfolk, they deprived of all their portable property,\r\ntheir arms and ammunition; and shortly after, thus equipped, they burned\r\nthe wheat stacks and barns of the police magistrate, Mr. Humphrey, and\r\nthose of Reardon, the district constable at Pittwater. The following\r\nmonth they appeared again at New Norfolk, and pillaged the residence of\r\nMr. Carlisle, who advising his neighbour, Mr. M'Carty, of their\r\nvicinity, induced him to arm for the protection of a vessel, the\r\n_Geordy_, which he presumed they would endeavour to capture. M'Carty,\r\nand those who were with him, coming up with the robbers, demanded their\r\narms. They were under the cover of a large hollow tree: the settlers\r\nwere thus exposed to their aim: Carlisle himself received a ball in the\r\ngroin, and three slugs in the breast, and died within an hour. O'Birnie,\r\nmaster of the vessel, was wounded by a ball in the cheek, which\r\nperforated his tongue and lodged in his neck. The banditti now commanded\r\ninstant surrender, which being refused, the firing was renewed. The\r\nsettlers were compelled to abandon one of their number, who was\r\npreserved by Whitehead from the violence of his comrades. When an\r\naccount of this skirmish was received, armed parties were dispatched\r\nfrom Hobart Town, and came closely on their track. They re-appeared at\r\nthe house of Mr. Humphrey, and compelled his servants to tie the hands\r\nof each other: they then plundered whatever they found useful,\r\ndestroying the rest in revenge: they had discovered handcuffs in the\r\nhouse. Hitherto Whitehead had been the leader; but his spite ultimately\r\nled to his destruction: he conducted his gang to the house of M'Carty,\r\ninto which they wantonly fired a volley of shot: a party of the 46th\r\nregiment were lying in ambush; a brisk fire commenced, and Whitehead was\r\nmortally wounded. The darkness of the night prevented pursuit: Whitehead\r\nran towards Howe, who, at his request, immediately cut off his head.\r\nThey had bound each other thus to provide against the recognition of a\r\nfallen companion--to deprive their pursuers of the promised reward. Howe\r\nthen became the leader of the band. A party of soldiers succeeded in the\r\ncapture of two who had separated from the rest: they also recovered\r\nammunition and fire-arms, of which the settlers had been pillaged. To\r\neffect the reduction of such disturbers of the public peace, martial law\r\nwas proclaimed by Lieutenant-Governor Davey--an exertion of power beyond\r\nhis commission, and opposed by his only official adviser, the Deputy\r\nJudge Advocate. Macquarie promptly disallowed this interference with his\r\nauthority. It was argued, that the right to declare martial law, if\r\nvested in Davey, might be claimed by any subaltern, whose distance from\r\nthe central authority gave the plea of necessity. To bring the offenders\r\nto justice at all, it was first necessary to take them: when in bonds,\r\nthey would cease to be dangerous, and might be forwarded to the\r\ntribunal appointed by the crown. These arguments did not prevail to stay\r\nprocess: a court-martial condemned to death Macguire and Burne,\r\nbushrangers, and Stephens, a perfidious stock-keeper, by whom they had\r\nbeen countenanced.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the robbers were rapid: they plundered the residence of\r\nMr. David Rose, near Launceston, and escaping a diligent pursuit, they\r\nre-appeared at Bagdad, a distance of 100 miles. Their scouts had\r\ninformed them that property to a large amount would be found there:\r\ntheir confederacy was extensive, and it was asserted by Howe, that some\r\nmost active in his pursuit, had been sharers in the profits of his\r\ncrimes. The tone assumed by this robber, was that of an independent\r\nchief, and in the management of his men he attempted the discipline of\r\nwar. They subscribed to articles, which bound them to obedience:\r\npenalties were inflicted, such as cutting and carrying wood for their\r\nfires, or even stripes. He professed the piety of a quarter-deck, and\r\nread to them the scriptures: his style and title was \"Governor of the\r\nRangers,\" and he addressed the King's representative as \"Governor of the\r\nTown.\" His taste for ceremony was once curiously exhibited: having met a\r\ntraveller, he ranged his party, and called on the stranger to witness an\r\noath, which was administered on the _Prayer Book_ by one of the gang.\r\nThe purport of their vow might be inferred from their message: they\r\nsaid, they could set the whole country on fire with one stick, and\r\nthrash in one night more than could be gathered in a year.\r\n\r\nHappily for mankind, the association of evil men is but transient. Howe,\r\noften absent from his party, without assigning reasons, awakened a\r\nsuspicion: he retreated with a native girl, Mary, but was shortly after\r\nfollowed by soldiers. His companion was taken, and he lost his dogs, his\r\nknapsack, and arms: it is said, that he fired at the girl, because she\r\nencumbered his flight; but it was asserted by himself, that he only\r\nintended to alarm, and not destroy her. She became useful to the\r\ngovernment, by discovering the resort of the robbers, and a flock of\r\nsheep they had stolen. At length, weary of his wandering life, Howe\r\nproposed to surrender to the government. A person, who had formerly\r\njoined him in an attempt to escape in an American vessel, became the\r\nchannel of communication. Howe affected to dread the violence of the\r\nsettlers, who might kill him for the reward, or to prevent his\r\ndisclosures; but Governor Sorell sent Captain Nairne to the place of\r\nmeeting, with an assurance of present safety, and intercession for his\r\nforgiveness.\r\n\r\nSociety must have been at the verge of dissolution, when letters and\r\nmessages passed between the government and an outlaw. To admit its\r\nprudence, requires a recollection, not only of the power of the robbers,\r\nbut the number of their friends.[88]\r\n\r\nThe disclosures of Howe were not important, and his companions continued\r\nstill a terror to the public: their losses were frequent, but they\r\nreceived continual accessions. They seized the boat, which carried\r\nprovisions between George Town and Launceston; probably with the\r\nconcurrence of the crew, several of whom joined them. They were now\r\ntwenty in number, and it became necessary to unite the colony against\r\nthem. The more opulent settlers were compelled to abandon their\r\ndwellings, and to take refuge in the towns. Sorell, by a spirited\r\nappeal, roused their more decided efforts to destroy the marauders:\r\nsums, subscribed by the inhabitants of Hobart Town, of eighty or one\r\nhundred guineas, were offered for their apprehension. A party of\r\nmilitary traced them to the Black Brush, and thence to a settler's house\r\nat the Tea Tree, where they had dined. They had the advantage of\r\nposition, but Geary, their leader, was slain, and several others\r\nwounded. The rain had damped the powder of the soldiers, which prevented\r\ntheir muskets from telling with full effect; but their success was\r\nominous to the robbers.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the character of Howe, on the plea of ill-health, he was\r\npermitted to walk abroad in charge of a constable; but whether he\r\ndistrusted the promise of pardon, or preferred the license of the bush,\r\nhe eluded his guard, and escaped--without, however, trusting his safety\r\nto the fidelity of his former companions. These soon met their fate:\r\nHillier resolved to purchase his life by the sacrifice of his comrades.\r\nAt midnight, while two of them slept, he attempted their destruction:\r\ncutting the throat of one, from ear to ear, and wounding the other with\r\nhis own rifle.\r\n\r\nThe bushrangers were now reduced to three: Howe, Watts, and Browne. The\r\nlast, surrendered; but Watts conspired with a stock-keeper, named Drewe,\r\nto seize Howe. This man, when in charge of his master's flock,\r\noccasionally corresponded with him. They accordingly met him, at a place\r\ncalled Longbottom. Within one hundred yards of each other, these old\r\ncompanions in crime demanded, and agreed, that both should knock out the\r\npriming of their guns: they then kindled a fire. Watts threw Howe on the\r\nground; Drewe tied his hands, and took his knives from his pocket: they\r\nthen prepared breakfast. After some delay, they proceeded to Hobart\r\nTown; Watts, with his gun, walking before Howe, and Drewe behind him.\r\nThe captive disengaged his hands, and, with a knife he had concealed,\r\nstabbed Watts; and in an instant, seizing his gun, he shot Drewe dead.\r\nWatts then expected a similar fate; he, however, reached Hobart Town,\r\nand was thence forwarded to Sydney, where he died of his wounds.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor, anxious to end the career of this desperate\r\nman, offered, beside the pecuniary reward, freedom and a passage to\r\nEngland to any prisoner, who might succeed in his capture. Stratagems\r\nwere continually devised to entrap him; but he retired into the distant\r\nparts of the wood, only appearing when hunger or lack of ammunition\r\ncompelled his visits. His courage and skill made him a formidable\r\nantagonist: none would venture to face him; yet so hot was the pursuit,\r\nthat he again left behind his knapsack and ammunition. He continued at\r\nlarge until the 21st October, 1818. Warburton, often an accomplice,\r\nbecame his betrayer: he enticed him to a hut, where he said that he\r\nwould find supplies necessary for subsistence; and, notwithstanding his\r\nhesitation, which occasioned long delay, he was caught in the snare:\r\nhaving discovered the ambush, he retreated with precipitation; but was\r\novertaken, and slain.[89]\r\n\r\nHowe was charged with several murders, beside those here recorded. It\r\nwas the fashion of the day, to admit every rumour of his cruelty. It was\r\nstated, on doubtful authority, that having quarrelled with Edwards, a\r\ncomrade, respecting some plunder, he slew him; that another, Bowles,\r\nhaving discharged a pistol in sport near his person, suffered the same\r\nfate--that he tied the hands and feet of the offender, and shot him\r\ndead. The death of Davenport, a stockman, without much probability, was\r\nattributed to Howe: his remains were afterwards discovered, without\r\nconfirming the suspicion. The relations of these men naturally led to\r\ntreachery and revenge, and in the terms of their union retaliation was\r\nincluded. Howe kept the secret of his gang, and displayed much sympathy\r\nwhen his companions were sick or wounded. He was a bold outlaw, prepared\r\nto maintain his freedom at whatever cost; nor does it appear that he was\r\nwanting in those equivocal virtues, which are compatible with a life of\r\nviolence and guilt. His knapsack contained a record of his dreams,\r\nwritten on kangaroo skin with blood; he was haunted by visions of his\r\nold companions who were dead: the subject of one, was his sister. He had\r\nmade a list of seeds, vegetables, fruits, and even flowers, intended to\r\nadorn the seclusion which he contemplated. Howe's form was athletic, his\r\ncountenance strongly marked; his beard of an extraordinary length, and\r\nhe was dressed in the skin of kangaroo.[90]\r\n\r\nFive years after his death, Howe's dwelling was found. The site was\r\nchosen with taste, in an open undulating country, stretching to the\r\nwestern mountains: the spot was secluded from observation, was covered\r\nwith a large honeysuckle, and on a rise sloping to the stream. A\r\ngigantic tree, prostrate, which he used as a chopping block, was the\r\nboundary to which he permitted Warburton to approach.[91]\r\n\r\nThe privation, fatigue, and anxiety endured by the bushrangers, they\r\nhave often depicted with horror. The country, destitute of indigenous\r\nfruits or herbs, afforded no safe retreat; and they were compelled to\r\nhover round the inhabited districts to obtain ammunition, even when\r\nwilling to live by the chase. The increase of the settlers has long\r\nprevented protracted concealment, and multiplied the chances of capture.\r\nPrompted by passion, or allured by the fascination of liberty, an\r\nunbroken succession of adventurers have sought shelter in the bush, and\r\npassed through the miseries of a vagrant life; but their suppression has\r\nusually been easy, and for years the penalty of their crimes certain.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of these memorials, allusions to bushrangers must\r\noccur; but the records of crime are disgusting. The Italian robber\r\ntinged his adventure with romance; the Spanish bandit was often a\r\nsoldier, and a partisan; but the wandering thieves of Tasmania were not\r\nless uncouth than violent--hateful for their debasement, as well as\r\nterrible for their cruelty. They can rarely be objects of interest, save\r\nwhen points in their career illustrate principles, or exhibit traits in\r\ncontrast with their ordinary course. It may be proper to notice\r\ninstances of courage, of constancy, or of unusual suffering: they may\r\nset forth the social state out of which they have arisen, and thus the\r\noperation of systems; but who would delight to read the dull details of\r\nwickedness which crowd the annals of this country?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: _Bigge's Report._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: The following are some that require no key:--Murderers'\r\nPlains, Killman Point, Hell Corner, Murderers' Tiers, Four Square\r\nGallows, Dunne's Look-out, Brady's Look-out, and Lemon's Lagoon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: A more singular instance occurred during the rule of\r\nColonel Davey. A reformed bushranger was dispatched to treat with a\r\nyoung man who had absconded from the commissariat: he resolved to\r\naccompany the messenger into the presence of the Governor; but he went\r\narmed. The kind old man received him with some rough salutation; but\r\nhaving discovered his pistol, he asked what was the meaning of that? In\r\nreply, he stated that he had resolved to shoot the messenger, if he\r\nfound treachery--a precaution, which rather amused than offended the\r\ngallant commander. This statement, made by a survivor of the scene, is a\r\ncurious relic of government.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: \"JACK WORRALL.--He was entrapped into the mutiny of the\r\nNore, but the only part which he took in the proceedings, was writing\r\nout in a fair hand several papers for the mutineers; and this he\r\ndeclared he did for no other purpose than to indulge his own vanity, in\r\ndisplaying his fine writing, upon which he had highly valued himself. He\r\nwas tried after the surrender of the mutineers, and transported for life\r\nto Van Diemen's Land. 'I was now,' said he, 'determined to make a push\r\nfor the capture of this villain, Mick Howe, for which I was promised a\r\npassage to England in the next ship that sailed, and the amount of the\r\nreward laid upon his head. I found out a man of the name of Warburton,\r\nwho was in the habit of hunting kangaroos for their skins, and who had\r\nfrequently met Howe during his excursions, and sometimes furnished him\r\nwith ammunition. He gave me such an account of Howe's habits, that I\r\nfelt convinced we could take him with a little assistance. I therefore\r\nspoke to a man of the name of Pugh, belonging to the 48th regiment--one\r\nwhom I knew was a most cool and resolute fellow. He immediately entered\r\ninto my views, and having applied to Major Bell, his commanding officer,\r\nhe was recommended by him to the Governor, by whom I was permitted to\r\nact, and allowed to join us; so he and I went directly to Warburton, who\r\nheartily entered into the scheme, and all things were arranged for\r\nputting it into execution. The plan was thus:--Pugh and I were to remain\r\nin Warburton's hut, while Warburton himself was to fall into Howe's way.\r\nThe hut was on the river Shannon, standing so completely by itself, and\r\nso out of the track of any body who might be feared by Howe, that there\r\nwas every probability of accomplishing our wishes, and '_scotch the\r\nsnake_'--as they say--if not kill it. Pugh and I accordingly proceeded\r\nto the appointed hut: we arrived there before day-break, and having made\r\na hearty breakfast, Warburton set out to seek Howe. He took no arms with\r\nhim, in order to still more effectually carry his point; but Pugh and I\r\nwere provided with muskets and pistols. The sun had been just an hour\r\nup, when we saw Warburton and Howe upon the top of a hill, coming\r\ntowards the hut. We expected they would be with us in a quarter of an\r\nhour, and so we sat down upon the trunk of a tree inside the hut, calmly\r\nwaiting their arrival. An hour passed, but they did not come, so I crept\r\nto the door cautiously and peeped out--there I saw them standing, within\r\na hundred yards of us, in earnest conversation; as I learned afterwards,\r\nthe delay arose from Howe's suspecting that all was not right. I drew\r\nback from the door to my station, and in about ten minutes after this we\r\nplainly heard footsteps, and the voice of Warburton; another moment, and\r\nHowe slowly entered the hut--his gun presented and cocked. The instant\r\nhe espied us, he cried out, '_Is that your game?_'--and immediately\r\nfired; but Pugh's activity prevented the shot from taking effect, for he\r\nknocked the gun aside. Howe ran off like a wolf. I fired but missed.\r\nPugh then halted and took aim at him, but also missed. I immediately\r\nflung away the gun and ran after Howe. Pugh also pursued; Warburton was\r\na considerable distance away. I ran very fast--so did Howe; and if he\r\nhad not fallen down an unexpected bank, I should not have been fleet\r\nenough for him. This fall, however, brought me up with him; he was on\r\nhis legs, and preparing to climb a broken bank, which would have given\r\nhim a free run into the wood, when I presented my pistol at him, and\r\ndesired him to stand: he drew forth another, but did not level it at me.\r\nWe were about fifteen yards from each other--the bank he fell from\r\nbetween us. He stared at me with astonishment, and to tell you the\r\ntruth, I was a little astonished at him, for he was covered with patches\r\nof kangaroo skins, and wore a black beard--a haversack and powder horn\r\nslung across his shoulders. I wore my beard also--as I do now: and a\r\ncurious pair we looked like. After a moment's pause, he cried out,\r\n'Black beard against grey beard for a million!'--and fired: I slapped at\r\nhim, and I believe hit him, for he staggered; but rallied again, and was\r\nclearing the bank between him and me, when Pugh ran up, and with the\r\nbutt end of his firelock knocked him down again, jumped after him, and\r\nbattered his brains out, just as he was opening a clasp knife to defend\r\nhimself.'\"--_The Military Sketch Book._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: This account is taken from the _Sydney Gazettes_, quoted\r\nby Wentworth; _Commissioner Bigge's Reports_, and _Bent's Life of\r\nHowe_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Bent, the government printer, published a pamphlet in\r\n1818, entitled, \"_Michael Howe: the last and worst of the Bushrangers_.\"\r\nThis pamphlet was reviewed by the _Quarterly_; \"it is,\" observes the\r\nreviewer, \"the greatest literary curiosity that has come before us--the\r\nfirst child of the press of a state only fifteen years old.

The settlers from Norfolk Island, who had acquired their liberty,\r\nor fulfilled their military service, became the employers of prisoners:\r\nmany of the masters, in their principles and habits, did not differ from\r\ntheir men--frequently, their accomplices and sharers of their spoil.\r\nThose engaged in the interior, in tending the flocks and herds, were\r\noften paid in proportion to the increase, and beside the property of\r\ntheir masters, they had charge of their own. This system, fraught with\r\nmischief, continued for many years, in spite of the interdicts of the\r\ngovernment, and the fatal results exhibited in the courts of justice.\r\nCattle and sheep stealing were carried to an astonishing extent: the\r\nowners, ignorant sometimes of the amount of their wealth, confided its\r\nsafety to men incapable of resisting ordinary temptation. The more\r\nopulent estimated their annual loss at one-fifth of the increase; and in\r\nunfavorable situations, where many cotters were established, they found\r\nthe preservation of their stock impossible, and relinquished the attempt\r\nin despair.[92] The brand was obliterated, often with great ingenuity:\r\nthe I became H, C was turned into G, and P into B; the more daring,\r\nblotted out all brands, by a heated shovel. Stock yards were enclosed\r\nand hidden by the bush, where cattle were slaughtered, and sheep by\r\nscores were salted down. Ewes were driven into the interior until their\r\nlambs were weaned, when they were returned to their owners. In supplying\r\nthe commissariat, it was not unusual to drive a flock of sheep for\r\ninspection, which were again returned to the fold, and others from a\r\nstolen stock passed under the certificate thus obtained; and the plunder\r\nof the royal herds, were slaughtered and sold to the crown.\r\n\r\nSuch depredations were enormous: large gangs were in combination, and\r\nthe first session held in Van Diemen's Land, brought to light extensive\r\nrobberies, comprehending twelve hundred sheep.[93] These evils were\r\nencouraged by difficulties in the administration of justice. For five\r\nyears, fifteen charges only were tried by the court of criminal\r\njurisdiction in New South Wales: the prosecutor, the witnesses, and the\r\nprisoners were forwarded together. On one occasion, six were sent up for\r\ntrial: the skins of the stolen beasts were deposited in a cask, and the\r\nproof was deemed complete; but of the same cooperage, another was\r\nprepared, an admirable imitation. This last was opened in court, but it\r\nwas found filled with the skins of seals; and, by the ingenious\r\ntransformation, the prosecution was satisfied.\r\n\r\nIt is just to observe, that the absence of legal redress not only\r\nprompted, but extenuated these violations of law: crime retaliated\r\ncrime: the lower settlers carried on a system of plunder; but the\r\nuncertain tenure of property weakened that moral principle which is its\r\nsurest defence. The cattle stealer was himself a loser by the man he\r\nrobbed: a stray beast was branded without question; the owner, when he\r\ndiscovered that his property was beyond his reach, except by the\r\nprosecution of the robber, adopted a shorter course. Reprisals thus lost\r\nhalf their guilt: nor is it wonderful that such feelings, as borderers\r\nwere said once to cherish, prevailed among men who found excuses in\r\ntheir position, and indemnified their past or possible losses by the\r\nfirst spoil which came in their way.\r\n\r\nBut these combinations led to other crimes. The robbers had their\r\naccomplices and abettors: the theft complete, they grew suspicious of\r\neach other, and some who disappeared, were sacrificed by the jealousy of\r\ntheir companions. When engaged in these depredations, they usually set a\r\nwatch: a cautious traveller avoided inquiry, and well authenticated\r\ninstances proved how perilous, in those days of violence, was an\r\nexpression of curiosity or suspicion.\r\n\r\nTo stop these plundering habits, the King's Commissioner Bigge advised a\r\nperiodical sitting of the court in Van Diemen's Land. In 1821, Judge\r\nWylde visited this country, and for various crimes, twenty-five persons\r\nwere condemned to death, of whom ten were executed. One hundred and\r\nsixteen persons were incarcerated prior to his arrival--a large\r\nproportion, compared with the census (7,372); but two years after, the\r\nnumber charged with similar offences proved that crime was not abated.\r\nAmong those who suffered death was George Richardson: his case\r\nillustrated the process by which such felonies were perpetuated.\r\nFormerly the confidential servant of Colonel Davey, he was employed by\r\nDr. Scott, and had charge of his flock--himself being an owner of stock.\r\nHaving received an order to supply Doctor Spence a quantity of sheep, he\r\ndeliberately separated them from a neighbour's flock, and drove them to\r\ntheir destination, with the coolness proper to an ordinary transaction.\r\nThe proof of guilt was too clear to be affected by artifice, though\r\ncalculated to elude suspicion by its very deliberation. Nor is it\r\ndifficult, when examining the criminal records of those times, to\r\nsuppose, that the trepidation natural when violating the law, was\r\novercome by the indifference of habit.\r\n\r\nFew of the higher classes, it may be presumed, connived at these\r\nnefarious transactions: one memorable instance, proved that no class is\r\nabsolutely safe in an atmosphere of guilt. A settler, connected with a\r\nScottish family of great respectability, thus forfeited his life. It\r\nwas stated that his robberies were incessant, and that he leagued with\r\nbushrangers; to whom, perhaps constrained by fear, he gave notice of\r\ndanger by signals. A secluded sheep-yard was discovered, and a large\r\nsheep brand, of a remarkable shape: at a distance, four hundred sheep\r\nwere found, bearing the mark newly made, which was contrived to\r\nobliterate the brand of Mr. Jones, the owner. The culprit had prepared\r\nthis flock, to transfer to another person, to whom a number were due. It\r\nwas in vain that witnesses testified to his character and to the\r\nrespectability of his house: the jury pronounced him guilty, and he was\r\nexecuted. A friend, who accompanied him to the scaffold, heard him say,\r\nthat that moment was the most happy of his life! It doubtless brought\r\ndeliverance. He left behind an infant family, the last of whom was born\r\nwhile the father was in prison, and an aged parent in Scotland; who,\r\nlong after he was dead, indulged her maternal tenderness, by preparing\r\nclothing for his use, and hoping for tidings of his prosperity. His name\r\nis suppressed, lest even now the record of his fate might meet the eye\r\nof a mourner.\r\n\r\nSociety, as it then existed, nourished every species of crime: tattered\r\npromissory notes, of small amount and doubtful parentage, fluttered\r\nabout the colony: dumps, struck out from dollars, were imitated by a\r\ncoin prepared without requiring much mechanical ingenuity; and plate,\r\nstolen by bushrangers and burglars, was melted down and disposed of in a\r\nsimilar form.\r\n\r\nNothing was neglected: they burnt the implements of husbandry for the\r\niron; they robbed the gibbet of the chains: they even wrenched the plate\r\nfrom the coffin of an opulent merchant, and stripped him of his\r\nshroud.[94]\r\n\r\nIn looking at the origin of the population, and the various inducements\r\ncontinually offered to the perpetration of wickedness, the total\r\ndissolution of manners is no subject of surprise. It was, perhaps, but a\r\nsmall aggravation, that prostitution and concubinage were held too\r\nvenial for remark: many of the officers of government made no secret of\r\ntheir relation to the women whom they adopted as mistresses, and\r\nsometimes respected as wives. Among the anomalies of the day, was the\r\nrelease of such females from compulsory attendance on divine worship, on\r\naccount of the official preference they enjoyed--a curious immunity from\r\na penal obligation: to be taken, perhaps, as a sinister acknowledgment,\r\nthat the government was not insensible to virtue--as the Russian\r\ncourtezan extinguishes the candle of ceremony, and veils her patron\r\nsaint.[95]\r\n\r\nSorell, on his accession to the government, attempted to reform the more\r\nflagrant abuses by which he was surrounded: he was aided in his task by\r\nMr. Humphrey, a man superior, by education and habit, to many charged\r\nwith similar duties. He established an exact register of the conviction,\r\narrival, and distribution of the prisoners, and appointed times for the\r\nmuster of such as were assigned. He imposed some restrictions on their\r\nwandering habits, and required that those who employed them should\r\nanswer for their residence. It was the custom, however, to allow the\r\ngreater part to reside in lodgings provided by themselves; they thus\r\nspent their leisure time where they were exposed to perpetual\r\ntemptation, and nightly robberies attested their diligence. The traders\r\nof Hobart Town, for several years, were compelled to sleep on their\r\ncounters, and watch their property with the most scrupulous care: an\r\ninquiry who had been pillaged, became the ordinary morning salutation.\r\nThe thieves broke through the walls with oriental skill: a stormy night\r\nafforded them a harvest. During a tempest of extraordinary severity,\r\nwhich deluged the streets and carried away fences, they contrived to\r\npillage to a great amount; a ladder was discovered at a window,\r\nconstructed for the purpose, by which they ascended to the upper\r\nchamber, and thus proved that no elevation was safe. Nor did they\r\nconfine their ravages to the towns; they entered the store of a settler,\r\nand stripped his dwelling of L400 worth of goods, which they conveyed by\r\nboat to Hobart Town. Many were living without any lawful means of\r\nsubsistence, and as their numbers increased, fraud and robbery were\r\nperpetrated in every house, and at every hour of the day.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the colony at the close of Sorell's\r\nadministration, who found that without the means of nightly restraint,\r\nall regulations of police were in vain. On resigning office, he\r\npredicted the difficulties of his successor, and warned him that he must\r\nexpect to contend with increasing crime.[96] To estimate the merit of\r\nArthur's government, it is necessary to remember those evils--with what\r\ndifficulty authority, long relaxed, is recovered--even by the most\r\nskilful and vigorous hands. When a few years had elapsed, the security\r\nof the colony was a subject of universal astonishment; and it was\r\nboasted, that men slept with their doors unlocked, and their windows\r\nunfastened, and often with property to a large amount strewed around\r\ntheir dwellings; notwithstanding, a dangerous temerity. By what means\r\nthese results were, even partially attained, the reader will be curious\r\nto know.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: Curr's account.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93:\r\n\r\n_Session_ (Judge Wylde), 1821.\r\n+--------+--------------------+----------------------+\r\n| Cases. |  Sheep in question.|      Owner.          |\r\n+--------+--------------------+----------------------+\r\n|   1    |        300         |   William Watterson. |\r\n|   2    |        100         |   Ditto.             |\r\n|   3    |        250         |   Daniel Stansfield. |\r\n|   4    |        150         |   Robert Gillet.     |\r\n|   5    |        200         |   Samuel Clements.   |\r\n|   6    |        100         |   Edward Lord.       |\r\n|   7    |         60         |   Crown.             |\r\n+--------+--------------------+----------------------+\r\n\r\nSome of these robbers suffered death: others are still in the land of\r\nthe living; and their names are suppressed, on the presumption of their\r\nreform.--_Compiled from Gazettes._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: Mr. Birch.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: _Bigge's Report._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: \"I entered upon the government, at a moment which my\r\npredecessor considered a most eventful one.

The administration of the penal\r\nlaws cannot be understood, except by a broad and continuous survey. The\r\ndevelopments of one colony re-acted on the other: Van Diemen's Land,\r\nlong the satellite of New South Wales, attended all its motions, and\r\nwith it prospered or suffered. From the fortunes of that colony, the\r\nhistory of Tasmania is inseparable.\r\n\r\nThe evils described, were not of a recent origin; they may be traced\r\nfrom the commencement of penal colonisation: the journals of the first\r\nofficers exhibit all sorts of mischief, which only entered into new\r\ncombinations as times advanced, and property was diffused. Collins,\r\nwhose account descended to the close of the century, records a perpetual\r\nstruggle with vice and crime. What could be expected of men who burned\r\ntheir gaol at the risk of their lives, and the church to escape\r\nattendance on worship?\r\n\r\nThe first expiree, James Rouse, who was established (1790) as a settler,\r\nwas industrious and successful. Phillip, anxious to test the competence\r\nof the land to sustain a cultivator, cleared two acres for this man,\r\nerected his hut, and supplied him with food. Fifteen months after, he\r\nrelinquished his claim on the King's stores, and received thirty acres\r\nof land, in reward for his diligence. It thus became common to afford\r\nsimilar facilities to expiree convicts,[97] but generally in vain.\r\n\r\nThe solicitude of Phillip was displayed in every form of kindness; but\r\nthe proneness of his subjects to intemperance, defeated all his efforts:\r\nhe gave them stock; and had scarcely left the land, when his gifts were\r\nsold for rum. His successor was not more successful, when he tried the\r\nsame plan. Cargoes of American spirit produced the madness of\r\nintoxication; and the freed settlers neglected their farms, or\r\nanticipated their produce to obtain the liquid destruction. Their\r\npassion for gaming was universal: they sometimes staked not only their\r\nmoney and their goods, but even their clothing, and were seen to labor\r\nin the field, as free from clothing as the savages who surrounded them.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the dread of famine, they consumed their time and substance\r\nin intemperance: sold their seed, lent to insure their harvest. In the\r\ndistribution of stores, robberies were daily committed; double rations\r\nwere issued; and Collins ingenuously confesses, that office converted\r\nthe most trusty into thieves; and that peculations were forgiven,\r\nbecause a change of agency was useless. All in superior circumstances,\r\nunprotected by military vigilance, were robbed and robbed again.\r\nMissionaries, who fled from Tahiti, found their countrymen more savage\r\nthan strangers: one was wounded, and plundered of all his property; and\r\nanother, murdered with an axe, while writing a receipt for a payment,\r\nwhich his destroyer thus hoped to evade. The Governor, in an imploring\r\ntone, enumerated the robberies which every day occurred, and hoped that\r\nthe constables, in whose presence they were committed, did not profit by\r\nsuch crimes! Those who obtained their freedom, were a source of infinite\r\nannoyance: unable to depart from the country, they refused all kinds of\r\nlabor; and, joined with others equally worthless, astonished the\r\nofficers by the vigour and ingenuity of their spoliations.\r\n\r\nThe account given by Collins, is a valuable delineation of society when\r\nset free from moral influence, and proves how little simple coercion can\r\ncheck a general disposition to crime. So rare was reformation, that a\r\nsingle instance is mentioned with triumph: among the few who redeemed\r\nthat settlement from utter dishonor, was George Barrington, celebrated\r\nfor his dexterity as a pickpocket, and for his pathos at the bar; who\r\nrobbed a prince with the grace of a courtier, and was the _beau ideal_\r\nof swindlers. He was distinguished in New South Wales for his integrity\r\nin the office of chief constable, and his diligence as a farmer. He died\r\nregretted, in the year this dependency was colonised.[98]\r\n\r\nGovernor Hunter authorised the opening of a theatre at Sydney. The\r\nprincipal actors were convicts, and in default of a chamberlain, they\r\nwere threatened, for a second offence, with the _penal_ settlement. The\r\nprice of admission, one shilling, was paid in meal or rum, taken at the\r\ndoor! Many had performed the part of pickpocket in a London play-house,\r\nbut at Sydney this was more difficult; yet they were not discouraged:\r\nthey saw by a glance at the benches what houses were left unprotected,\r\nand proceeded to rob them. The motto of the actors was modest:--\"We\r\ncannot command success; but we will endeavour to deserve it.\" Their\r\nfirst play was _The Revenge_: the first prologue, characteristic both of\r\nthe actors and the audience. The aptitude of one of these couplets, has\r\ntransferred it into a proverb; but it is worth seeing in its connexion,\r\nas a representation of the real sentiments with which violations of the\r\nlaw were remembered.[99]\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE.\r\n\r\n    From distant climes, o'er wide-spread seas we come,\r\n    Though not with much eclat, or beat of drum,\r\n    True patriots we, for be it understood,\r\n    We left our country, for our country's good;\r\n    No private views disgraced our generous zeal,\r\n    What urged our travels, was our country's weal.\r\n      But, you inquire, what could our breast inflame,\r\n    With this new passion for Theatric fame?\r\n    He, who to midnight ladders is no stranger,\r\n    You'll own will make an admirable Ranger.\r\n    To seek Macheath we have not far to roam,\r\n    And sure in Filch I shall be quite at home.\r\n    As oft on Gadshill we have ta'en our stand,\r\n    When 'twas so dark you could not see your hand,\r\n    From durance vile our precious selves to keep,\r\n    We often had recourse to th' flying leap;\r\n    To a black face have sometimes ow'd escape,\r\n    And Hounslow Heath has proved the worth of crape.\r\n      But how, you ask, can we e'er hope to soar,\r\n    Above these scenes, and rise to Tragic lore?\r\n\r\n    Too oft, alas, we've forc'd th' unwilling tear,\r\n    And petrified the heart with real fear.\r\n    Macbeth, a harvest of applause will reap,\r\n    For some of us, I fear, have murder'd sleep;\r\n    His lady, too, with grace will sleep and talk,\r\n    Our females have been us'd at night to walk.\r\n      Sometimes, indeed, so various is our art,\r\n    An actor may improve and mend his part:\r\n    \"Give me a horse,\" bawls Richard, like a drone,\r\n    We'll find a man would help himself to one.\r\n    Grant us your favor, put us to the test,\r\n    To gain your smiles we'll do our very best;\r\n    And, without dread of future Turnkey Lockits,\r\n    Thus, in an honest way, still pick your pockets.[100]\r\n\r\nThe connection between ardent spirits and the early disorders of our\r\npenal colonies is patent at every stage of their progress. Then the\r\nhabits of the navy were intemperate; rum was considered the great parent\r\nof valor. The founders of our colonies never entertained a suspicion\r\nthat society could exist without its aid. Thus the first fleet, in their\r\nprogress, touched at a port to take in a large supply, which proved of\r\nthe most deleterious kind:[101] every vessel was deeply laden with the\r\nsame commodity. The limitation of wholesale dealing to the officers, was\r\nnot to restrain its consumption, but to monopolise its profits. The\r\nadvantage of its distribution, as an incitement to labor, atoned for the\r\nmoral ravages it spread: for this reward alone, would the prisoners\r\nyield their full strength; and when the taste, inflamed by indulgence,\r\ndrove them to crime, or laid them in the dust, their ruin suggested no\r\nreflection beyond the general evils of intemperance. Had the light of\r\nscience illuminated the imperial authorities, they perhaps had provided\r\nsome check on this grand incentive to crime.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of Bligh was occasioned by this fatal appetite: whether\r\nfrom sullenness, or conviction, he discouraged the vendors of rum, and\r\nattempted to obstruct their living on the vices of the prisoners. The\r\nlanding of a still, and its seizure, was followed by a series of\r\naltercations, which led to the military rebellion, and terminated his\r\ngovernment. This event roused the public attention for a moment, to the\r\nstate of the colony. In 1811-12 a committee of the House of Commons was\r\nappointed \"to enquire into the manner in which the sentence of\r\ntransportation had been executed, and the effects produced by that mode\r\nof punishment.\" The result was remarkable: the committee advised that\r\nmore constitutional tribunals should be established, and distillation\r\nallowed.[102] The ministers of the day feebly vindicated the royal\r\ncommission violated in the deposition of Bligh; and having once more set\r\nin motion the machine of legal government by the appointment of\r\nMacquarie, fell back into long slumber. Thenceforth, and for many years,\r\nrum was a great agent in the working of government, and the source of\r\nprivate opulence. The monopoly escaped official hands, but the expirees\r\nsucceeded to the profitable calling. The large fortunes accumulated by\r\nmany, were rarely derived from any other trade. Their prosperity was\r\ntraced with startling uniformity: they sold their spirits to the\r\nsettlers for produce, which they vended at the royal stores: they\r\nindulged them with credit, until hopelessly involved, when mortgages\r\nwere executed, and foreclosed with a rapidity and precision which leaves\r\nmodern conveyancing in the shade.[103] Individual powers of consumption\r\nwere incredibly great: the expiree farmer, and his not more intemperate\r\nprisoner servant, broached the vessel, poured out its contents into\r\nbuckets, and drank until they were insensible, or until, roused to\r\nfrantic vigor, they were swift to shed blood. Such scenes were\r\ncommon.[104]\r\n\r\nThe specious advantage to the revenue, exhibited by our colonial\r\nstatistics, protected a vice so useful. The influence of this interest\r\ncannot be overstated: to put down spirit drinking would, in equal\r\nproportion, disturb colonial finance. The demands of the public service\r\nwere always in advance of its means, and no colonial administration was\r\nfound sufficiently enlightened or courageous to add the prevention of\r\nthis poisonous indulgence to the other consequences of banishment.\r\n\r\nMacquarie revived the policy of the Stuarts, in regulating this trade:\r\nto Messrs. Wentworth, Riley, and Blaxland, he granted (1810) the\r\nexclusive privilege of importation, and by the duty they paid (7s. per\r\ngallon), erected a hospital. They proved, in defiance of economists, how\r\nmonopoly can, sometimes, enlarge the supply, and thus increase the\r\ndemand. They dispatched their agents to the Mauritius, India, and the\r\nCape, and bought at 2s. 6d. per gallon; and arrack and rum deluged the\r\ncolony. The success of their enterprise was great: in less than two\r\nyears they obtained sufficient to raise the edifice, which could not\r\nwant occupants, and cost more than L20,000.\r\n\r\nThe effects of this measure were flagrant: a letter, addressed by\r\nMarsden, the chaplain, to Macquarie, depicted the wretched condition of\r\nthe prisoners. The scenes of dissipation which passed before him\r\ndeprived him of repose. Freed women, living at Parramatta,\r\nunprovided with public shelter, ran headlong into vice, and dropped all\r\naround him, slain by rum and dissipation. He stood aghast and powerless\r\nbefore the devastation: at times he observed, \"I envy the situation of\r\nthe most menial servant, who is free from this solemn and sacred\r\nresponsibility.\"[105] The reply of Macquarie was witty rather than\r\nrelevant. He told Lord Sidmouth, in effect, that the sorrows of Marsden\r\nwere too deep for discovery: noted for the cheerfulness, and even gaiety\r\nof his temper, his movements were too rapid for grief; and his days,\r\ndivided between the cares of farming, grazing, and trade--to say nothing\r\nof his clerical occupation--left him no time for sorrow.[106] The evils\r\nhe described are, however, proved by uniform testimony: they must exist\r\nwhere dealing in spirits is the sure path to wealth, and wealth the\r\ntitle to social distinction.\r\n\r\nIn the _Rocks_, drunkenness and debauchery were constant and\r\nundisguised: persons of respectable appearance, in the day time, were\r\nliable to mal-treatment; but those who, in the night, entered the\r\n\"fortress of iniquity,\" were usually stripped and plundered. Broils and\r\nboxing matches were of perpetual occurrence; the public-houses were\r\n\"fences;\" and degraded women, in large numbers, crowded these dens of\r\nthieves.[107]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to give a chronological history of the spirituous\r\nepoch. The reign of intemperance commenced with the first proclamation:\r\nit received all the protection of law, and the favour of government: it\r\nwas embodied in our penal administration. Whether it was possible to\r\ncheck its mischief, some may doubt; but that it has clenched the\r\npopulation fast; that it has formed our gangs--crowded our prisons; that\r\nit has covered our scaffolds, and filled ten thousand graves--is certain\r\nas death!\r\n\r\nThe correspondence maintained between the convicts and their friends,\r\ninformed them of their prosperity. The alluring picture, drawn by those\r\nwhose bondage was past, exhibited a social state, precisely suited to\r\nthe taste of their kindred and acquaintance. The sensual and dissolute\r\nwere tempted by the riotous jollity of the \"Rocks;\" those fond of\r\nequivocal commerce with the profits of trade; and others were cheered by\r\nthe assurance that a friend in bonds would find a nominal master in a\r\nrelative or former friend, when the formalities of inspection were\r\nover.[108] Such as brought out spoil, were besieged with offers of\r\ninvestment, and found themselves in a market where money was the\r\npassport to favor and indulgence; others, less fortunate, were pillaged\r\nby those who crowded them with welcomes,[109] or drawn into bargains\r\nwhich proved that no cozening art was lost.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the occasional good fortune of prisoners, one Hazard, may\r\nbe worth remembrance: he had been before transported; in 1815, he\r\narrived under a second sentence, for life. While on the voyage out, he\r\npurchased a quantity of tobacco: he received, on landing, a\r\nticket-of-leave; immediately married the daughter of an innkeeper, and\r\nobtained a license, in the name of his wife, to the same calling: he was\r\npatronised by the most respectable settlers, and enjoyed prosperity\r\nuntil his death, only five years after his arrival.\r\n\r\nIn this colony, the acting secretary of the Governor secured his ticket\r\nat his landing, and was long distinguished for the extent of his\r\ninfluence, and the elegance of his dwelling.[110] It may be presumed\r\nthat, however explained on the spot, these examples were not lost on the\r\nrepublic of thieves; and many were disposed to try that fortune which\r\nwas so often propitious.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary of Newgate, Mr. Cotton, a well-known name, in his evidence\r\nbefore the Commons in 1818, has left nothing to conjecture. The\r\nprisoners of his day \"looked on transportation as a party of pleasure:\"\r\nthey departed from the prison with huzzas, and bade glad adieu to their\r\nless happy companions and keepers, exclaiming, \"what a glorious kangaroo\r\nhunt we will have at the Bay.\"[111]\r\n\r\n    \"Stabant orantes primi transmittere cursum\r\n        Tendebantque manus ripae ulterioris amore.\"\r\n\r\n    VIRGIL.\r\n\r\nTo distinguish bravado from triumph, is sometimes difficult; but there\r\nmust have been little to appall, where there was so much to hope: nor\r\ndid they perceive that, though many were fortunate, not a few, at the\r\nbrightest era, groaned in bondage; that degradation and suffering,\r\nsometimes, reached their utmost limits, at which death itself stops the\r\nhand of vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe opinions that prevailed among the prisoners, in reference to the\r\nintentions of the British government, were adopted by Macquarie himself;\r\nhe held, like them, that the colony was established for the benefit of\r\npersons convicted, and that in forming a system of political government,\r\ntheir social welfare was the grand design to pursue. The notion was not\r\nwithout support. In the nominal list of the first fleet, not more than\r\nfifty in all were banished for terms exceeding seven years.[112] To\r\nsuppose that these were perpetually excluded from the immunities of\r\nBritish subjects, would be to attribute to expatriation a forfeiture\r\nbeyond the operation of English law. The opinion was further fortified\r\nby the distribution of land, under regulations which were intended to\r\nencourage their permanent settlement, and limited only to such as, \"by\r\ntheir good conduct and disposition to industry, should be deserving of\r\nfavor, and receive emancipation and discharge from their\r\nservitude.\"[113] This opinion was still further sustained by the\r\ncomparative neglect of emigration, and the selection of officers, for\r\nsituations of authority and trust, from the ranks of the prisoners. A\r\ncomparison of property acquired by the various classes, in 1820,\r\nexplains many anomalies[114] in their social aspect, and vindicates the\r\npolicy of Macquarie himself. It is shown, that the emancipists and their\r\nchildren were more than five times in excess of the free; and that their\r\nproperty in land, trade, and commerce, exceeded by more than one-half\r\nthe possessions of the voluntary settlers.\r\n\r\nTo erect the barriers of caste around so small a section, and to exclude\r\nemancipists from the common intercourse of social life, was a task no\r\nGovernor could then accomplish, without danger. The changes which\r\nfollowed Macquarie's administration, especially the growth of a free\r\npopulation, enabled his successors to effect what, in 1817 to 1820, had\r\nbeen attempted in vain. The opposition encountered by Macquarie, and\r\nwhich he resented with the ardour of his character,[115] enabled his\r\nenemies to represent him as the patron of criminals. He was said to look\r\nupon their offences in the light of misfortunes, which they were to\r\nrepair in the country of their exile, rather than to atone by the\r\nseverities of toil and privation;[116] and that they were taught to look\r\nupon no title to property, as so just as that which had been derived by\r\npassing from crime to conviction; from thence to servitude,\r\nemancipation, and grant.[117]\r\n\r\nThe difference of opinion and feeling between the Governor and military,\r\nled to the combination of emancipists, who did not veil their former\r\ncondition, but ennobled it by raising it to a political interest; who\r\nadopted a designation, and formed a system of morality, to which it is\r\nuseless to look for a parallel. They returned with bitterness the\r\nreproaches of the free, and insisted on the benefit of the proverb,\r\nwhich ascribes more virtue to the vigor of reformation, than the\r\nconstancy of obedience.[118] Their advocates would ask, with exultation,\r\nwhether any emigrants were found whose life would bear a scrutiny?\r\nWhether greater crimes are not tolerated by the refinements of vice than\r\nthose which are commonly visited with the vengeance of the law? or,\r\nexhibiting the doctrines of christianity in their aspect to the\r\npenitent, they thundered forth denunciations against the proud and the\r\nself-righteous! The champion of this system, Mr. W. C. Wentworth, turned\r\nthe artillery of his wrath against the exclusionists: \"and shall not,\"\r\nhe exclaimed, in the ardour of his youth, \"shall not the sole\r\nefficacious remedy be administered (the restoration of the civil rights,\r\ncapacity to become magistrates and legislators), because a set of\r\n_interlopers_, in nowise connected with the purposes for which this\r\ncolony was founded, wish to monopolise all the respectable offices of\r\nthe government, all the functions of emolument, dignity, and power,\r\nthemselves.\" \"How can they expect pardon of God, if they withhold\r\noblivion from their repentant fellow creatures.\" \"Retrospection should\r\nnot be pushed beyond the period of arrival, but then subsequent good\r\nbehaviour should be subject to the severest tests. The re-convicted\r\noffender, branded with the _lasting_ impressions of infamy, should be\r\nrendered ever after incapable.\"[119]\r\n\r\nSuch was the recognised code of the emancipist: it were, indeed, easy to\r\nsee that the several convictions of some small rogue might not, in their\r\naggregation, equal the crime of him who sinks a ship or burns a house,\r\nor the guilt of an atrocious offence, which escapes the last penalty of\r\npublic vengeance, by some legal error; but to obliterate the first\r\nstigma of those who constituted the great body of a population, and\r\nwhose self-respect was their chief chance of virtue, was not\r\nunreasonable.\r\n\r\nThe evils which rose from this system of oblivion, are to be traced to\r\nthe indiscretion which formed a community of criminal origin. The\r\neffects produced by their equipages, luxury, and licentiousness, on the\r\nBritish population, when set forth in the language of romance, were not\r\nto be charged on the local government. It is in the nature of commerce\r\nto collect wealth: the traders were nearly all expirees; they became\r\nrich, not because they were transported, but because some were\r\nindustrious, others saving, and others fraudulent; and because they were\r\nin the midst of a system of expenditure, which made the Treasury of\r\nEngland their bank.\r\n\r\nThe acquisitions of men, who had been prisoners, with great absurdity\r\nand forgetfulness, were attributed to the laxity of the local governors.\r\nEven now, many who are dextrous, shrewd, and persevering, acquire\r\nconsiderable properties: their prosperity awakens no alarm, because they\r\nare lost amidst a dense population, and are surrounded by emigrants, who\r\nby similar vices or virtues are not less opulent, but far more numerous.\r\n\r\nThe first sound that fell on the ear of the prisoner, when he stood\r\nbefore Governor Macquarie, tended to animate his confidence: having\r\nenquired of his treatment through the voyage, he then informed him that\r\nthe past was left to oblivion, and that the future would determine his\r\ncondition,[120] This was often no vain promise: the sentiments he\r\nexpressed were, more or less, recognised by the preceding Governors. The\r\nCommons, in 1812, gave his policy their sanction, and Earl Bathurst,\r\nthough with more reserve, favored the same opinion. Macquarie never\r\ndisguised this system of mercy.[121] When transportation only\r\ncontemplated the establishment of a colony, this system of oblivion was\r\nuseful; but the passage from the bar of justice to liberty, was\r\nsometimes not longer than the passage from England: and those who rose\r\nto wealth, by their character and career, gave to public retribution the\r\naspect of grimace.\r\n\r\nOn the appointment (1814) of H----, as superintendent of convicts, an\r\noffice then of greater _real_ power than any other in the penal\r\ndepartment of the British empire, Macquarie, says Bigge, gave an\r\nenumeration of his merits; and continued frequently to publish in the\r\n_Gazette_ eulogies on his character. This is slily sketched by the\r\nCommissioner himself, and with more precision by Dr. Reid, who was on\r\nthe spot at the time. Mr. H---- was a convict, and was placed in office\r\nat Sydney, but breaking into the King's stores, either in person or by\r\ndeputy, and taking away a bale of slops, he was re-transported to\r\nNorfolk Island, where he won the government notice by his diligence as a\r\ndealer in pork, and was recommended by the commandant to Macquarie. This\r\nman exercised his functions in the Turkish style: he rigorously\r\ndepressed all unseasonable attempts at virtue; but nothing was\r\nimpossible to those who were able and willing to pay, for whom he was\r\naccustomed to act as banker. His manners were coarse to loathsomeness,\r\nand he addressed the prisoners in language which outstripped their\r\nown;--\"eclipsed them in wickedness, and in revolting filthiness.\" Nor\r\nwas his domestic position more respectable: his wife was one of two, too\r\nbad for endurance, who were forced from the colony, and sent to England\r\nfor reformation.[122] Such was the man entrusted with more than\r\nmagisterial power.\r\n\r\nWhile the female prisoners were landed, his clerks became brokers\r\nfor masters, friends, and husbands. When ships arrived, boats\r\ncrowded round them, and the visitors chose, among the female prisoners,\r\na wife, or such other relative as might answer to their prior\r\nengagements.[123] Having _sworn_ to these ties of kin, the\r\nsuperintendent assigned them according to the plan of the contracting\r\nparties, who, within twenty-four hours, had been total strangers. We may\r\nimagine the _eclat_ with which so clever a device would be appeared to\r\nthe correspondents of the fortunate transport.\r\n\r\nThose, whose appearance or dullness excluded them from these resources,\r\nwere taken to the factory. On their arrival, \"according to custom,\" they\r\nwere met by a body of men, who, having satisfied the constables, spread\r\nbefore these women the spirits and provisions provided for the feast of\r\nwelcome: what followed need not be told. The connivance of the\r\nsuperintendent, with the most of these excesses, might be expected from\r\nhis character; and although he displayed considerable tact in subjecting\r\nthe prisoners to his control, his appointment and prerogatives almost\r\njustified, and they fully accounted for, the rancour with which his\r\npatron was opposed and condemned.\r\n\r\nThus Macquarie did not exercise the caution requisite to preserve his\r\ngenerous designs from parliamentary censure: imprudent efforts to give\r\neffect to his conviction, involved him in a contest which hastened his\r\nrecall, and it is said, shortened his life.[124] He raised to the bench,\r\nand invited to his table, several emancipists of wealth, and made their\r\nsocial reception the condition of his favor. When elevating to offices,\r\nhe sometimes violated his own rule of forgetting the past, by basing his\r\neulogy on the reformation of the person he delighted to honor. The\r\ndetails of their character, furnished by the indignant or malicious,\r\ncast an air of ridicule on their public reception. The subalterns of the\r\narmy refused to join their superior officers in entertainments, at which\r\nemancipists were guests. The resentment of Macquarie aggravated the\r\nquarrel, until the differences divided the colony into factions, and\r\nfinally originated the emancipist party; and by provoking observation,\r\ntended to increase the severity which fell on their successors.\r\n\r\nIn those times of despotism, many were transported for political\r\noffences, which in Great Britain leave no moral stigma, and when\r\nforgiven by the crown, close no social circle.[125]\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of New South Wales--founded on the government\r\nexpenditure, so vast as to excite the most serious complaints, but so\r\nsubtle as to elude imperial censure--was but slightly participated by\r\nVan Diemen's Land. Its later occupation, the low character of the first\r\nsettlers, and the subordinate station of its ruler, afforded no room for\r\nfashion. Many emancipists in Sydney had become wealthy by the vices of\r\nthe less cunning and thrifty, and created a social state, without a\r\nprecedent. They could command the most expensive luxuries; and, compared\r\nwith them, the highest officers of the government were poor. They looked\r\nfor the honors of opulence, and did not perceive that an emancipist must\r\npass through oblivion to honor; and that, in this case, to distinguish\r\nis to stigmatise.\r\n\r\nIt was observed by Mr. Bigge, that when Macquarie made some emancipists\r\nmagistrates, and professed by that dignity to restore them to the\r\nstation they had lost, he forgot that they were elevated to a rank they\r\nhad never filled. It was equally true, that a large number of free\r\ncolonists, whose pretensions in early life were equally limited, rose by\r\nopulence to a superior station, and higher pretensions: to deny the\r\nusual appendages of their position, would be virtually to degrade them.\r\nWhether just or not, the formal exclusion of emancipists was a\r\nsupplement to the penalty of the law, and, as such, must have been\r\ntaken. It is not the actual exaltation, but equal eligibility of British\r\nsubjects to the highest station, which constitutes that equality so\r\ngrateful to Englishmen: the son of a sweep may keep the conscience of a\r\nking.\r\n\r\nThere were freed men, who were even detestable for their wealth; others,\r\nwhose offences would not have excluded them from any society. Such was\r\nthat of Mr. Redfern, transported when a boy, for dropping a word to the\r\nmutineers of the Nore. Society will ever make its exceptions, founded on\r\nthe nature of the offence, the proofs of reformation, or the general\r\ncharacter; but Governor Macquarie resolved to wash out the stain by\r\nauthority, and to treat those as enemies who disputed his policy, or\r\nrefused to share in its promotion.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the free to make no distinction between those who\r\nmerited the oblivion of their offences, and emancipists atrocious in\r\ntheir history and character, rendered the hostility of caste more\r\ninveterate.\r\n\r\nThe measures of Macquarie were followed by years of faction: a press,\r\nrepresenting emancipist interests and emancipist principles, and making\r\nthe Governor the instrument or the object of the most violent hatred;\r\nstill, on their side, the emigrants were often positive, virulent, and\r\ncontemptuous.\r\n\r\nFrom this, Van Diemen's Land was free: there were few whose wealth or\r\neducation could pretend to rank. One gentleman so situated, Mr.\r\nGatehouse, by his respectability and intelligence, won the respect of\r\nall classes: he was admitted to the table of the Governor, and was only\r\ndistinguished by the colonists for his enterprise and probity. When an\r\noffice of trust was in their gift, they chose him to share it with the\r\nchief merchants of the island; and thus pronounced the judgment which\r\ngood men will adopt, against both an undiscriminating ban and an\r\nunlimited admission.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner, Bigge, joined with the anti-emancipists, in almost\r\nevery prejudice or opinion. Great as were the services he rendered by\r\nhis keen observation and courageous delineation of colonial society, in\r\nthis, and some other instances, he overlooked those facts of its\r\nhistory, which gave a disastrous prominence and authority to the\r\nemancipist settlers; and enabled them to claim consideration which\r\noffended the free men, not always superior in substantial merit.\r\n\r\nBut disabilities, far more serious and unexpected, united the\r\nemancipists, and obtained the sympathy of many who could not be charged\r\nwith indifference to crime. The remission of punishment was in the\r\ndiscretion of the Governor-in-chief: the 30 Geo. iii, authorised the\r\ngranting of pardons, and the commission of the Governor, which recited\r\nthis provision, was supposed to convey the power. In 1811, Macquarie\r\ndeclared that a long course of good conduct would be an essential\r\npreliminary; but the rule was more easily stated than enforced: and, in\r\n1813, one day in the year was fixed for pardons. It was declared that\r\nconditional pardons could only be granted when ten years, or half\r\nsentence, had expired; or, for absolute pardons, until fifteen years, or\r\nthree-fourths had been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nFond of dispensing mercy, he appointed a day, when those who thought\r\nthemselves entitled crowded his presence. The petitions, drawn up by\r\nletter-writers, dwelt on every topic calculated to move to compliance;\r\namong which were profuse compliments to the Governor's benevolence and\r\nhumanity. The concourse of suppliants was often very great--many\r\nventuring to ask, who did not hope to obtain; and whose sole claim to\r\nmercy, was the bad terms on which they lived with the law. The crowd\r\npressed on with their (700) petitions, which the Governor read in their\r\npresence, and by one letter of the alphabet gave liberty to the\r\nimpatient captives, or sent them back to merit freedom, as freedom was\r\nthen merited. The _Court of Clemency_, thronged by suitors, would have\r\nafforded a fine subject to the artist--a scene unique in the history of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe dispensation of pardons was not regulated by any uniform principles.\r\nThe interest of superintendents was given, as the reward of task-work\r\nperformed for the crown; more successful, by services rendered to\r\nthemselves. Such was a common condition; but many are mentioned, who\r\nobtained their pardons on easier terms than personal labor. The loan of\r\na horse and cart, driven by his assigned servants, procured the\r\nliberation of the lender; others hired vehicles to convey his\r\nExcellency's baggage during his progresses, and thus payed in money the\r\nprice of freedom. The bargain was public, and questions of national\r\npolicy never entered the minds of him who granted, or those procuring\r\nthe royal mercy. The grant of pardons, thus formed an important\r\ndepartment of Macquarie's government.\r\n\r\nA decision of the Court of King's Bench, Bullock _v._ Dodds, where the\r\nplaintiff was an emancipist, seemed to peril their freedom and property.\r\nThe defendant, when sued in England on a bill, pleaded the attaint of\r\nthe plaintiff, who had received the pardon of Macquarie. The validity of\r\nthese remissions, which affected great numbers, was thus brought to the\r\ntest. The Chief Justice, Abbott, declared that an attainted person was,\r\nin law, as one _civiliter mortuus_: he might _acquire_, not because he\r\nwas entitled _to hold_ any possession, but because a _donor_ could not\r\nmake _his own act_ void, and reclaim his _own gift_. Thus, a person\r\ngiving or conveying property, could not _recall_ it, but the convict\r\nattaint could not _hold_ it; and it passed to the hands of the crown, in\r\nwhom the property of the convict vested. This being the law, any\r\nticket-of-leave holder, or any person whatever standing on the pardon of\r\nthe Governor, was liable to be deprived by the crown, or obstructed at\r\nany moment in attempting to recover by suit at law.\r\n\r\nThe practice of the Sydney Supreme Court had long virtually rejected\r\nsuch distinctions. The mixed considerations of convenience and equity\r\ninduced the judges to allow the witnesses and plaintiffs the same\r\nprivilege, whether under attainder or not. Judge Field[126] declared,\r\nthat while the crown did not interfere, the court would not touch the\r\nproperty of the convict: nothing but an attested copy of conviction,\r\nwould be admitted as evidence of conviction. Nor would the proof of\r\ntransportation, of itself, as the law then stood, prove the incompetence\r\nof a witness. His time might have expired; his expatriation might have\r\nbeen the condition of his pardon, or his offence might have been a\r\nmisdemeanour, and not involve the corruption of blood;[127] and, except\r\nfor perjury or subornation of perjury, the King's pardon might restore\r\nhis competency to give evidence, or hold property. On these grounds the\r\ncourts of New South Wales were enabled to evade the plea of attainder in\r\nbar of a just action.\r\n\r\nBut the decision of the King's Bench discovered a serious omission in\r\nthe forms of pardon issued by Macquarie, and further enquiry even threw\r\ndoubt on his power to grant them at all. The Act of Parliament empowered\r\nthe crown to delegate the _authority to remit_ a sentence of\r\ntransportation, to the Governor of New South Wales; but the commission\r\nof Macquarie said nothing of this power, except the criminals were\r\ncolonially convicted, when he could grant reprieves and pardons. His\r\n_instructions_ authorised the pardons to British offenders, and those\r\ninstructions were warranted by _parliamentary enactment_; but the royal\r\ncommission gave _no such power_: and thus all his pardons were legally\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\nAnother essential condition was neglected: to give effect to the pardon\r\nof the Governor, it was required that he should transmit to the\r\nSecretary of State the names of the persons whose sentences he remitted,\r\nto secure their insertion in the next list of general pardons. This\r\ncourse had never been taken: no list of remissions had been furnished to\r\nDowning-street.\r\n\r\nAmong the extraordinary omissions of the government at home, was in many\r\ninstances the place of trial, and even the sentence of the transports;\r\nto save the labour of penmanship, \"ditto,\" was sometimes the sentence\r\nfound under another name, in the line of which 7, or 14, was written;\r\nnot at full length, but in numerals. Some \"indents\" exhibited erasures:\r\nin one, a sentence of seven years had been converted to \"life.\" More\r\nstrange than all, some were sent without even their names, and others\r\nwithout any sort of information of their crime or sentence; and the\r\nauthorities felt justified in gaining by artifice, from the unsuspecting\r\nprisoners themselves, what the ministers had neglected to furnish.\r\n\r\nAn Irishman, who could give no information, was suited to a sentence by\r\na process of analogy: he was set down, in compliment to his comrade, for\r\n\"life.\"[128] The regular transmission of this kind of information was\r\nneglected, chiefly, by the Irish executive; ever slow to perceive the\r\nobligation of reason and justice. The longevity of abuses is among the\r\nmost instructive lessons of history. The first fleet left their lists\r\nwith the owners of the transports: soon after their arrival, several\r\nprisoners declared their sentence was completed; this, the government\r\nwas unable to affirm or deny, and therefore did nothing; but one of the\r\nclaimants, having expressed his discontent in a manner disrespectful to\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor, received 600 lashes, and six months in\r\nirons![129] Such atrocious neglect of the first principles of equity, is\r\na sad set-off against the license of indiscriminate pardons. The Roman\r\njudge was a far better casuist: \"For it seemeth to me unreasonable, to\r\nsend a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against\r\nhim.\"[130]\r\n\r\nA quarrel between Mr. Justice Field and Mr. Eagar, an emancipist\r\nattorney, displayed more forcibly the effect of the decision of the\r\nEnglish Chief Justice. Judge Field presided at a session of magistrates\r\nat Parramatta, when Eagar attempted to act as counsel: this was\r\nprevented by the court; and the judge, as chairman, expressed himself,\r\nin reference to Eagar, in terms of severe disapprobation and contempt,\r\nstigmatising him as a common _barrator_, or mover of quarrels, whom the\r\nGovernor might justly prosecute for sedition, or banish from the colony.\r\nEagar, not daunted by the philippic of the judge, resolved to sue him in\r\na secondary court for slander, and to recover back fees paid in the\r\nSupreme Court, and which he alleged the judge had levied illegally; but\r\nJudge Field ordered his solicitor to file an affidavit of his belief\r\nthat Eagar was under attainder, and prayed for time to obtain an office\r\ncopy of his conviction: this course was allowed, and the action\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nNot long after, Eagar attempted to recover certain penalties imposed by\r\nthe Act of Charles II. on foreign merchants trading in the British\r\nplantations: the penalties were enormous, and the law was obsolete. The\r\nparticular object of Eagar was, to suppress the competition in the sale\r\nof tea, which the superior trading connection of Messrs. L. Mestre and\r\nCo. enabled them to offer. The French merchant very fairly pleaded the\r\nattaint of the plaintiff, and Judge Field, in giving judgment, insisted\r\non the obvious injustice of the suit; that men, whose trading was\r\npermissive--themselves the creatures of indulgence--and who, by\r\nconnivance, were allowed to become wealthy and prosperous--should\r\nendeavour to rouse forgotten and restrictive statutes, to put down\r\nuseful commerce, and abuse privileges conceded by the clemency of the\r\ncourt; to force the court to become the instrument of oppression: he\r\ntherefore allowed the plea of the merchants to bar the action of the\r\nplaintiff.\r\n\r\nAll this, on the face of it, was just; but the emancipists saw that it\r\ngave to the judge a discretion which laid them helpless at his mercy:\r\nthe same plea might be offered, to cover a fraudulent debtor, or deprive\r\na large majority of traders of legal protection. Nor was it a competent\r\nanswer, that the policy of the colony had been of an opposite\r\ndescription: to stand on suffrage, was to stand in peril.\r\n\r\nPrompted by this feeling, the emancipists formed themselves into\r\ncommittees at all the settlements, and obtained the countenance of the\r\nGovernor to a plan for moving the British legislature, to correct the\r\nanomalies of the law. At a public meeting, Mr. Redfern presiding, the\r\nadministration of Governor Macquarie was the subject of their glowing\r\neulogy. They predicted, that his name would be immortalised by the\r\ngratitude of their descendants, who would remember his policy with\r\nveneration. Against this meeting the judges protested, and professed to\r\nforesee great peril to the dignity of their tribunals, and to the public\r\nsafety; but the calm and guarded proceedings of the emancipists avoided\r\nthe scandal, and gained their cause some support. The indignation of the\r\njudges was unreasonable: in the administration of justice they had\r\nusually protected the equitable rights of the emancipists; but it was no\r\nreason for astonishment, that a large trading interest felt uneasy in\r\nholding by indulgence privileges of so great importance, and were\r\nanxious to obtain, by a declaratory statute, the remedy of their\r\ngrievances. Mr. Eagar was nominated secretary to their body, and\r\ninstructed to obtain parliamentary support: in this he was successful.\r\n\r\nIn the discussions of the Commons, the discontent of the emancipists was\r\ncondemned by the tories, and vindicated by the whigs. Peel charged\r\nMacquarie with culpable neglect, in omitting to forward the lists; but\r\nhe observed, no general pardon had been issued for fifty years: what it\r\nmeant, was unknown! The Act required the Governor to send home the\r\nnames, and the Secretary to insert them in a general pardon; but he\r\ncould not tell in what manner to perform this duty. This was, he said,\r\nof no practical moment: an individual might sue out a pardon, under the\r\ngreat seal, without cost. He strongly opposed vesting by law in the\r\nGovernor, a power to grant absolute pardons--an interference with the\r\nprerogative royal, and dangerous to public justice. To sustain this\r\nopinion, he instanced the case of a man who had been transported for\r\nforging a title to an estate, and who, under such a pardon, had returned\r\nto Scotland to pursue his claim.\r\n\r\nThe zeal of Eagar in the cause of the emancipists, provoked the\r\nanimadversion of ministers: they hinted that he was liable to be treated\r\nas a felon at large, and was indebted to the lenity of the executive for\r\nhis safety; but Sir James Mackintosh, who gave respectability to the\r\ncause he espoused, vindicated the claims of the emancipist with great\r\nwarmth, and excused the earnestness with which the confirmation of his\r\ntitle to liberty had been sought. That great and good man displayed, in\r\nevery debate, the generosity of his temper: always the enemy of\r\ndespotism, every form of oppression called him into action, and the\r\nemancipists were largely indebted to his eloquence. After long delay,\r\nthis agitating question was settled, but with a reservation of serious\r\nmoment. The new law[131] confirmed all the pardons granted in New South\r\nWales, with the rights they included; rendering them of full effect when\r\nthey should be ratified by the crown. It further provided that no future\r\npardon should be held valid until allowed by the Secretary of State, and\r\nthen only within the colony of New South Wales and its dependencies--a\r\nserious drawback from the attractions of the boon, as understood before;\r\nbut which was no barrier to the further extension of the royal clemency.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of Macquarie argued, that the profusion of mercy had not\r\nbeen followed by reformation: the emancipists, they alleged, were\r\nunchanged in principle, and never abandoned their habits of crime. This\r\nview was sustained by Mr. Wentworth's representations, which were\r\nintended to subserve another end. He attempted to prove that financial\r\noppression had driven back the expiree on his former course, which the\r\nanti-emancipists maintained he had never forsaken.[132] It was, however,\r\nthe universal opinion, that atrocious crimes were diminished, and\r\nmisdemeanours increased.\r\n\r\nThe penal statistics were swollen by the extensive jurisdiction of\r\npolice: by the cognizance of acts which, in other countries, are left to\r\nopinion. The distribution of public money, annually increasing towards a\r\nquarter of a million, placed within the reach of all the pleasures they\r\nwere accustomed to obtain, without the risks of crime. A closer\r\ninspection does not, however, exalt our opinion of their moral worth; of\r\n4,376 emancipists, reported by the chaplains, 369 were tolerable, but\r\n296 only were respectable.[133] Nor was the accusation without force,\r\nthat the proof of reform, admitted by Macquarie, was the possession of\r\nmoney; that to thrive, by whatever means, within the letter of the\r\nstatute, was to honor the law, and to deserve well of the crown.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Macquarie was attacked with great vehemence,\r\nand every detail of his scheme called in question. The British\r\ngovernment never had a system: the ministers treated every difficulty\r\nas a thing apart from all others; and thus to arrest one form of\r\nmischief, they released another. They directed the establishment of\r\nseparate settlements, and thus occasioned the vast expenses of their\r\ncontrol. They then approved the concentrated labor of Macquarie, and\r\nwhen its cost became severe, advocated dispersion. Every parliamentary\r\ndiscussion terminated in the abandonment of some principle, or the\r\nestablishment of some novelty. Always affected by the passing aspect of\r\ntransportation, the people of Great Britain never acquire a connected\r\nview of the causes which alter its results; and have thus condemned or\r\napplauded the local officers, for events casual or inevitable.\r\n\r\nTo diminish the pressure of the prisoners on the British treasury,\r\nMacquarie granted tickets-of-leave: the holders, without employment and\r\nwithout capital, became robbers. Then he turned his thoughts to public\r\nworks of permanent utility, and requiring continued labor: these\r\nprojects gradually absorbed his attention, and perhaps perverted his\r\njudgment. Inspired by an able architect, whom the chances of public\r\nretribution had thrown in his way, his erections greatly surpassed the\r\nsimple constructions of his predecessors. The settlement assumed the\r\naspect of a large building establishment, such as were seen in the\r\nancient world, when captives were subject to task-masters, and generals\r\nwere chief masons. The more skilful the mechanic, the greater his value\r\nto the works, and the smaller his chance of liberty: yet, to reconcile\r\nhim to his lot, he was mostly permitted to choose his own abode, and was\r\nenabled, by his surplus time, to obtain all the comforts and luxuries of\r\nthe colony. But the expenditure, which added to the opulence of the\r\nsettlers, enabled them to build also: they looked with envy on the\r\ngovernment which detained so large a proportion of the mechanical power:\r\nthey forgot that the unproductive employment of large numbers created\r\nthe demand for their crops, without which no dollar had been theirs to\r\nspend. Their outcries rung in the ears of the Commissioner: he blamed\r\nthe improvidence of the Governor, who had rejected their applications,\r\nand threw some ridicule on his architectural ambition. The Commissioner\r\nonly saw a gaol, but Macquarie believed, that when he erected an edifice\r\nhe was forming a model; and that in aiming at symmetry and refinement,\r\nhe was fixing the taste of a people.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of reconciling adverse elements in penal colonisation,\r\nhas been ever visible. The modern principles of colonisation demand\r\nconcentration: the establishment of so many branch settlements was\r\nconsidered, from the beginning, a great economical error; and by those\r\nunaware of its justification, was the subject of strong and pointed\r\ncondemnation. No sooner, it was observed, had the settlers landed their\r\nboxes, than they started a division for Norfolk Island; and others, in\r\nrapid succession, broke off into fragmentary colonies. The same bridges,\r\nschools, and courts, would be sufficient for ten thousand united people,\r\nbut must be multiplied with the separate settlements. It was urged that\r\nthe concentration of labor would decrease the expense of its\r\nsupervision, and extend the resources of the community, by varying its\r\nindustry. Such were the doctrines of political writers,[134] but when\r\nthey were adopted they were found to produce unforeseen practical\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe dispersion of the first era was necessary to safety: in the time of\r\nMacquarie the public was in no apprehension of rebellion or famine, and\r\nthus prisoners could be combined; but the aggregation of bad men will\r\nalways exhibit an appalling and disgusting aspect: and the excesses,\r\nsufferings, and debasement connected with the public works, the\r\npeculation of the officers and the indolence of the men, brought again\r\nin view the evils of associated labor; and reinforced the arguments for\r\ndispersion. The men, when together, became dealers, and indulged in all\r\nthe vices of cities; scattered, they became savage, and filled the\r\ncolonies with crimes.\r\n\r\nThe secondary settlements have been often the theatres of great iniquity\r\nand oppression, and the commandants have dared injustice, which no\r\nsupreme authority would venture: to these meaner, and sometimes\r\ncontemptible agents, the prisoners must be subjected, on the principle\r\nof dispersion. Such practical difficulties start up at every instant,\r\nand thus expose the policy of the government to perpetual oscillation.\r\nAn instance, of later date, will demonstrate the danger of minute\r\nsub-divisions, which exclude a public press and a public opinion. A\r\ncommandant resolved the seduction of the daughter of a prisoner: he\r\ncrept into her father's house, and offered violence. The father wrote to\r\nthe Governor (Brisbane); his letter passing, of course, through the\r\noffice of the commandant; who read the complaint, and ordered the aged\r\nparent to the triangles. The doctor, knowing the nature of the offence,\r\nrefused his sanction, on a plea of health. The tyrant still insisted;\r\nbut the obstinate humanity of the surgeon prevailed. What then? The\r\nfather was sent from the station, and, after a while, the daughter was\r\nthrown on Sydney, a prostitute. This officer had an accomplished wife:\r\nshe detected improper company in her room, and her exasperated husband\r\nbroke her arm to repress her outcries! It is to such hands that the\r\nprisoner has been too often entrusted: to men, only known for their\r\nvices--broken down by debt and dissipation--who have taken refuge, with\r\nthe wrecks of their fortune and reputation, in a military command.\r\n\r\nThe obligation of this history to the Reports of Mr. Bigge, renders it\r\nproper to explain the origin, nature, and operation of his commission.\r\nThe representations of several colonists, that the administration of\r\nMacquarie was subversive of public justice and favorable to crime; that\r\nhis expenditure was lavish, and his projects ridiculous, had reached the\r\nhouse of parliament. To these charges the Rev. Samuel Marsden, chaplain\r\nand magistrate, added the full weight of his authority. This person,\r\nfrom his long residence, had assumed a prominent place among the\r\nmagistrates. By his connection with two great societies for the\r\npropagation of Christianity (the Church, and the London), he commanded\r\nlarge influence in the religious world. Nothing can be more opposite\r\nthan the estimates of his character, given by the partisans of the\r\nemancipists, and those furnished by his ecclesiastical associates.\r\nSoured by the vices rampant around him, and perhaps deteriorated by the\r\nadministration of justice, when it was hard to distinguish the\r\nmagistrate from the executioner, he does not always appear to have\r\nmerited the unmeasured eulogies of his friends.[135] He was, however,\r\ncelebrated for his attention to the islands of the Pacific, whose\r\nwelfare he promoted with exemplary diligence: his house was the home of\r\nthe missionaries who touched at Port Jackson; whose letters spread\r\nthrough Europe the reputation of his benevolence. In reference to his\r\nultimate intentions, their apprehension of his character was probably\r\njust; but the magisterial office is rarely compatible with the duties of\r\nan ecclesiastic--least of all, when punishments were discretionary, and\r\ninflicted on the spot. The servant, charged with a misdemeanour, he\r\nflogged; who then took to the bush, and re-appearing, charged with a\r\ncapital crime, was hanged; and the magisterial divine attended him on\r\nthe scaffold. This was not peculiar; most clergymen were magistrates.\r\nBut Marsden was warm and sensitive--perhaps, resentful. The punishments\r\nhe inflicted were distinguished for their severity: his opposition to\r\nvice, his unsuccessful struggle to prevent it, and some methods of\r\ncoercion, not then uncommon, but which now look like torture, exposed\r\nhim to the hatred of the prisoners. The differences between Macquarie\r\nand this resolute clergyman, were frequent--they ended in open rupture;\r\nand at length became so personally offensive to the Governor, that\r\nMarsden was dismissed from the commission of the peace.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Grey Bennet, member of parliament for Shrewsbury, addressed a\r\nletter to Earl Bathurst, founded on the material furnished by Mr.\r\nMarsden. This publication delineated a great variety of abuses, and\r\ncharged Macquarie with ignorance, rashness, and oppression. Having thus\r\nprepared the way, a motion was made in parliament, which led to the\r\nissue of the Commission of Enquiry, entrusted to John Thomas Bigge,\r\nEsq., a relative of Mr. Bennet, and by profession a barrister. The\r\nCommissioner was attended by Mr. Hobbs Scott, formerly a wine-merchant,\r\nand afterwards Archdeacon of New South Wales; on whom the prosecution of\r\nthe enquiry devolved, in the event of the Commissioner's death. The\r\nappointment of this commission was extremely painful to Macquarie: it\r\nexpressed distrust in the government, or the ascendancy of his opponents\r\nin parliament. Nor was it difficult to foresee, that an enquiry\r\nconducted by one individual, who must depend on the statements of\r\nfactions, and colonial factions, of all the least scrupulous--always\r\nliable to many serious errors--must become a formidable instrument in\r\nthe hands of one or other of the parties struggling for supremacy.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner landed (October, 1819) in New South Wales, with the\r\nhonors due to a gentleman distinguished by the royal confidence. The\r\ncivil and military officers, with a large assemblage of the colonists,\r\ncollected to witness the ceremony of presentation. The oaths of\r\nallegiance and supremacy were administered by the Judge Advocate, and\r\nthe commission read. This document recited that it was necessary to\r\nenquire into the laws, regulations, civil, military, and ecclesiastical;\r\nand to ascertain the revenue, trade, and resources of the colonies. The\r\nCommissioner was charged to report the information collected, \"and his\r\nopinions thereon.\"\r\n\r\nMacquarie addressed the Commissioner, and congratulated himself and the\r\ncolony on the arrival of a servant of the King so eminent. Nothing could\r\ninspire him with greater hope for the public weal. The assistance in his\r\npower, he would cheerfully afford: the prosperity of the colony would\r\ngratify the first wish of his heart.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner then addressed the assembly, stating that though the\r\nterms of his commission were explicit and comprehensive, he deemed it\r\nright to embrace the occasion to explain the object of his Majesty's\r\ngovernment, and to prevent any possible misapprehension of their\r\nmotives. The increase of transportation to these colonies, and the\r\ndoubts entertained of the efficacy of the system of secondary\r\npunishments, had prompted the enquiry. His arrival had been delayed, but\r\nthe time would give opportunity for minute researches into the state of\r\ncrime, undertaken by Mr. Buxton; and for the revision of the penal code.\r\nIt belonged to himself to examine whether these colonies had answered\r\nthe purposes of their institution, and whether their attainments in\r\ncivilisation had not disqualified them from fulfilling their original\r\ndesign; or whether it were yet possible, to render transportation a\r\nterror at home, and an instrument of punishment and reformation. This,\r\nthough the principal topic, would not exclude others of moment: he\r\nexpected assistance from every class, and felt encouraged from the\r\ndisplay of candour by the head of the government; from which he augured\r\nthe most beneficial results. He then concluded in the following\r\nwords:--\"I will only add, I bring to this investigation the deepest\r\nconviction of its importance: I approach it without any prejudice that\r\ncan influence my future opinions, either of systems or individuals. I\r\nfeel a determination, from which no earthly consideration shall move me,\r\nof conducting it to its conclusion, with the strictest impartiality _to\r\nall_. In the course of the enquiry I mean to pursue, I shall give\r\nsufficient opportunities to those whose attendance I may require, to\r\nconsider the points submitted to them for their declarations and\r\nopinions. I wish to impress on every one, that my principal object is\r\nthe attainment of truth; and while I am free to declare, that nothing\r\nis to be apprehended from a fair and candid disclosure of truth, yet I\r\nam equally bound to apprise the community, that nothing is to be hoped\r\nfor from the concealment of the truth for private purposes, or from the\r\ngratification of malignant feelings and personal resentment.\" He warmly\r\nacknowledged his honorable reception from Governor Macquarie, who\r\nassigned him precedence to all but the Lieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner's arrival in Van Diemen's Land (1820) was attended with\r\nthe same military honors: wherever he went he was received with\r\nceremony, and watched with jealousy and apprehension. The habits of Mr.\r\nBigge were simple, complacent, and industrious: he labored to draw from\r\nall classes their feelings and designs--nothing escaped his curiosity.\r\nHis opinions are given on every subject with equal quietness, whether\r\nthey relate to the salting of beef, or the most profound questions of\r\ngovernment. The Reports he sent to the Secretary of State descended to\r\nthe smallest matters: he noted every rood of land granted, and every\r\nration issued. The style of these documents is felt to be prolix, and\r\ntheir arrangement perplexing. Their contents excited very general\r\ninterest in England, and in Australasia unbounded indignation.[136]\r\nWhatever epithet of hatred and contempt could be applied by impotence\r\nand wrath, for years fell on the imperturbable Commissioner and his\r\nsecretary. He was charged with eaves-dropping, back parlour scandal,\r\npartisanship, and wilful lying. The particular delineation of individual\r\nconduct, and which he thought requisite to illustrate systems, excited\r\nthe utmost vexation: it was painful to officers, to find their\r\ncharacter, their habits, and the profits of their places, laid open to\r\nnational observation. Perhaps, those details were sometimes beyond an\r\nobvious political necessity; but the plain exhibition of principles in\r\nold English phrases--giving vice its true name--measuring the results of\r\ntransportation by a standard recognised outside both the mess-room and\r\nthe gaol--was of vast advantage to the colonists themselves. The\r\nreference made to Bigge's Reports in this work, however, is always\r\nlimited to facts, which could not be distorted or colored. His\r\nconnections, and the spirit of his mission, prejudiced his judgment,\r\nrespecting a system which had been the growth of circumstances; but his\r\nintegrity is transparent, not less than his prepossessions. Time will\r\nextract the sting of his disclosures; but their moral results will\r\nremain. They tended to destroy those evils which can only live in a\r\ncongenial atmosphere--and wither, except in the shade.\r\n\r\nThe Reports of the Commissioner were published by order of the House of\r\nCommons in 1822: Macquarie closed his official career on the 1st\r\nDecember, 1821, having held the government for twelve years. Thus their\r\nlabors and opinions came before the parliament and the world together.\r\nMacquarie, when he considered himself entitled to reward, for a period\r\nof service of unusual length, found it was necessary to defend his\r\nreputation. Betrayed by the warmth of his temper into some irregular\r\nacts, which ill expressed the ordinary spirit of his government, he was\r\nvulnerable to his assailants. The flogging of freed men, notwithstanding\r\nthe precedents left by his predecessors; the scandalous neglect of moral\r\nprecautions, in the disposal of the women; and prominent instances of\r\nunjustifiable lenity; constituted serious deductions from his merit. He\r\nwas, however, exempted from pointed censure, and the crown assigned\r\nL1,000 per annum, as his retiring pension. This favor was scarcely\r\nconferred, when he was called before that Tribunal, where conduct and\r\nmotives are seen together: he died at St. James's, London, on the 1st\r\nJanuary, 1824, and his remains were carried to the Isle of Mull, North\r\nBritain; where, according to his last wish, they rest in the tomb of his\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\nGeneral Macquarie is entitled to be regarded as the founder of these\r\ncolonies: before his time, they were but hutted camps. To their\r\nimprovement he devoted all his energies: he foresaw and felt the\r\ninspiration of their destined greatness. His disinterestedness was\r\nexemplary: throughout his long administration, no sordid project was\r\nconnected with his name. No patriot ever labored more earnestly for his\r\ncountry's welfare. Every device, which seemed to promise material\r\nadvancement to the community, was certain of his favor; every\r\ncontribution from the meanest settler, was sure to obtain its reward.\r\n\r\nBut if he accepted neither gold nor silver, as the recompense of his\r\ncares, he took pledges of the colonies for the immortality of his name.\r\nIt resounds in every place, and is united in every form with the natural\r\nobjects and history of these regions. The name of his son, of his wife,\r\nof his native mountains and early haunts--all flourish in this\r\nhemisphere: of these, many were conferred by the flattery or kindness of\r\nhis friends. Their frequent recurrence confuses geography; they echo\r\nfrom hill to dale, and from the river to the sea.[137]\r\n\r\nThe moral character of Macquarie was not impeached. Happy in his\r\ndomestic relationships, as a husband and father he exhibited an example\r\nof fidelity and tenderness. The people quickly learned this key to his\r\nregard, and he felt with all the gratitude of a generous nature, the\r\nreverence paid to the virtues of his wife, and the interest affected for\r\nhis son. Mrs. Macquarie supported his efforts to reclaim the colonists\r\nfrom the habits of concubinage, which disgraced their early history: she\r\ncould not, without utter seclusion, enforce those social rules which are\r\nproper in more settled society; but her sentiments were unequivocal, and\r\nhastened many a marriage--and saved many escutcheons from a bar! Mrs.\r\nMacquarie survived her husband ten years: she expired at Mull, in March,\r\n1834.\r\n\r\nThe indifference to moral worth, ascribed to Macquarie, will admit\r\nanother view. He estimated too highly the agency of affluence, in\r\nraising the moral sentiments; but in promoting external decency, it has\r\nconsiderable power. Macquarie was a soldier, and a man of the world:\r\nthose delicate springs, which set in motion the finer affections of the\r\nsoul, are open to the Christian, but are not found on the battle field,\r\nin the courts of law, or the seat of government. The notions of this\r\nruler were material: he believed that another generation would cast off\r\nthe habits of the passing, and abhor and forget the vices of their\r\nparents: nor was he mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe admitted political errors of Macquarie's government must be largely\r\nascribed to his peculiar position. When we scan the system he\r\nconstructed or modified, justice requires that we should consider, not\r\nonly the materials he possessed, but the condition in which he found\r\nthem. The rebellion of the officers had destroyed their authority, the\r\nstores were exhausted, discipline relaxed, and those who had exacted the\r\nmost servile homage, were themselves dependant for impunity on the royal\r\nclemency. He employed the discretion with which he was entrusted, to\r\navert the miseries of forfeiture; but he could not restore the relations\r\nbetween the bond and the free, which revolt had shaken; or dispense with\r\nthe counterpoise of emancipist support.\r\n\r\nMany years elapsed, ere the re-action of his system attracted the\r\nattention of parliament; until then, it was approved or tolerated by the\r\ncrown. The pressure of a strong and united party, what ministers have\r\nthe courage to withstand? They were willing that the Governor should\r\nbear the odium of measures, long subject to their cognizance, which they\r\nhad passed by unreproved, and sometimes even applauded. Macquarie\r\nthought he had gained a triumph, when he raised emancipists to social\r\ndistinction, and detained a mass of transgressors within the rules of\r\nobedience; and, for a time, so thought the ministers. They desired to\r\nestablish a city, out of the materials of the gaol; but when they saw\r\nthe success of their plans--half civic, half felonious--they were\r\nterrified at their own creation, and wished the city had remained a\r\nprison. In this feeling, Macquarie did not participate: he delighted in\r\nthe result of his policy; and wondered at the inexorable cruelty of\r\nthose who grudged an asylum to their unfortunate countrymen--who\r\nattempted to dash from their lips the liberty and hope they began to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nWhether it were possible, without a free community, to retain ten\r\nthousand persons in perpetual vassalage, or to uphold a system of simple\r\ncoercion and social exclusion, in a colony so remote, remains a\r\nquestion; but it is none, that the name of Macquarie will become more\r\nillustrious, as the traditions of faction subside, and classes are\r\nblended in the unity of a people. It will be said that he found a\r\ngarrison and a gaol, and left the deep and broad foundations of an\r\nempire!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: The instructions to Macquarie (1809) were--grants at 6d.\r\nquit rent.

Poured into a bucket, none could be\r\nunfairly abstracted--_all_ shared alike; but had it not been so\r\narranged, some rogue of the party would have removed some bottles, when\r\nthe rest were off their guard; and thus reserved for himself the\r\npleasures of intoxication, when the others were obliged, for lack of\r\nspirits, to be sober!]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: Bigge, however, states, that Marsden himself was a\r\ntrafficker in spirits, and felt naturally opposed to the profuse\r\ncompetition he encountered; yet the reader will recollect that this was\r\nthe common article of barter--its use universal, in even the most\r\ncorrect society; and that it was rather to the disorderly habits of the\r\nhouses which vended it, than to its consumption, that the most rigid\r\nmoralists of the day would object.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: Letter to Lord Sidmouth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: _Surgeon-superintendent Reid's Voyages to New South\r\nWales._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: Cunningham.\r\n\r\nThe following is a picture of things as they were:--\"The madames on\r\nboard, occupy the few days which elapse before landing in preparing the\r\nmost dazzling effect, on their descent upon the Australian shore.\" \"With\r\nrich silk dresses, bonnets _a la mode_, ear pendants, brooches long,\r\ngorgeous shawls and splendid veils, silk stockings, kid gloves, and\r\nparasols in hand, dispensing sweet odours from their profusely perfumed\r\nforms--they are assigned as servants.

The changes he advised\r\namounted to a total revolution in the system, subject to his censorship;\r\nbut so obstinate are evils, fostered by local interest and lengthened\r\nindulgence, that years elapsed before the effects of his influence were\r\npowerfully realised. He, however, secured for the exclusionists the\r\nrecognition of their favorite principle, and not only were emancipists\r\npronounced ineligible for the future, but those already in the\r\ncommission found it expedient to resign. Mr. Redfern was dismissed.\r\n\r\nThis determination of the imperial authorities, by whatever reasons\r\nsupported, was a deviation from a practice which covered the entire\r\nperiod of Macquarie's government; therefore sanctioned, expressly, or by\r\nthe silence of the crown. The degradation of those on the bench, could\r\nnot have been politically important, and was one of those acts of power,\r\nwhich rather gratify the vengeance of caste, than vindicate the purity\r\nof government. The mortification of the emancipists, at this triumph,\r\nwas intense: they justly felt, that the ministers, and not they, were\r\nresponsible for measures which had recognised their eligibility to the\r\nusual honors of colonial opulence; and that, even were it expedient to\r\nabandon the former system, a less violent process might have been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to describe the career of an emancipist, of whose\r\nelevation Mr. Bigge remarks, \"that it had been most strongly urged\r\nagainst Macquarie by his enemies, and most questioned by his friends.\"\r\nThis case (1810) formed the precedent for appointments from persons of\r\nhis class, and, as selected by Mr. Bigge, may be considered a specimen\r\nof the most objectionable. The facts of the Commissioner are all here\r\nembodied; his detracting tone is abated.\r\n\r\nAndrew Thomson was a native of Scotland: his relations of that class of\r\ntraders, in their own country called merchants; who carry their goods\r\nfrom town to town. He was sixteen years of age on his arrival in the\r\ncolony, and therefore, a boy of fourteen or fifteen when he forfeited\r\nhis liberty. When free, he engaged in business as a retail shopkeeper,\r\nand traded to Sydney in boats built by himself: the defects of his\r\neducation he partly cured by application, and acquired such knowledge as\r\nordinary retail shopkeepers possess. He established a salt manufactory,\r\na ship-building establishment, and it was _rumoured_, an illicit\r\ndistillery. He was chief constable: kept a public-house--such was the\r\ncommon practice of traders. He acquired great influence among the\r\nsettlers, by his forbearance and liberal credits; his business extended,\r\nand he became a considerable landholder. He supported the legal\r\nauthority during the rebellion, and suffered for his loyalty; a just\r\nground for the esteem of that Governor, who came to restore the\r\nauthority of his sovereign. When an inundation of the Hawkesbury exposed\r\nthe settlers to great suffering, he undertook their relief; supplied\r\nthem with goods, and was happily a gainer by the risk which his humanity\r\ninduced him to incur: so great was the importance of prompt exertions,\r\nhe was permitted to employ both the men and boats, which were under his\r\ncontrol as superintendent of convicts.\r\n\r\nIn his neighbourhood, there were but two persons suitable to the office\r\nof magistrate, and having filled that of chief constable with great\r\napprobation, the Governor, Macquarie, considering his youth at the time\r\nof his offence--the merit of his loyalty when few were loyal--his\r\nindustry and opulence, and his reputation for humanity--did not think\r\nhis former condition a bar to a commission of the peace. It is said that\r\nLieut. Bell, who conducted the party by whom the government-house was\r\nsurprised, and a Governor made prisoner, objected to his appointment;\r\nbut his opposition was confined to murmurs, or if represented at home\r\nmet with no sympathy from the ministers.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomson was admitted to the company of the Governor, and the parties\r\nof the military, who yet, it is said, were not pleased with the abrupt\r\nsuppression of the absolute ban. He died within the year of his\r\nelevation to the bench. Governor Macquarie commanded an epitaph to be\r\nplaced on his tomb, stating that \"it was in consequence of his character\r\nand conduct, that he appointed him to the magistracy; and that, by the\r\nsame act, he restored him to the rank in society he had lost.\" His death\r\nwas regretted by his neighbours, who in a public address to his\r\nExcellency described him \"as their common friend and patron.\" It must be\r\nadded, he had participated in some of those immoralities, which, in the\r\ntime of the Prince Regent, dishonored the residence of kings; and he\r\nescaped that just reproach which could not be expected where the\r\nselection of mistresses was the prerogative of military command. Such is\r\na fair statement of Andrew Thomson's character, as given by Bigge,\r\nwithout his reflections.\r\n\r\nThe disclosures of the Commissioner terminated the indulgences given to\r\nexpirees, with such \"unsatisfactory results.\" The small portion of land\r\ngranted them, without great industry, was incapable of supplying their\r\nwants, and they were the pests of their neighbours; or, when they\r\nsettled on allotments in town, they obtained materials from the royal\r\nstores by the assistance of their fellows.[138] Land was still granted,\r\nbut not as the indispensable consequence of transportation.\r\n\r\nThe plan of recompense to officers in kind, he also condemned: rations\r\nof food and rum, double and triple; and the assignment of men to earn\r\nwages, as the salaries of their masters, were gradually substituted by\r\npayments in money. The small sums formerly allowed, were rather the\r\nwages of servants who live on their fees: by a casuistry, never long\r\nwanting to those who earnestly seek it, even men beyond the rank of\r\noverseers, persuaded themselves that the recognised stipends were never\r\nintended to be reckoned as payment.[139] The tender of these supplies\r\nwas a source of profit to the officers; like the butlers of noblemen,\r\npersons of the highest trust were not insensible to presents; and\r\nmerchandise was accepted only when the \"regulars\" were duly paid. The\r\nwaste of public property, occasioned by the system, was great. The loss\r\nand sacrifice of clothing and tools; the spoiling of food, and the\r\nwilful destruction of implements, proved how large may be the outlay of\r\nthe crown, without much advantage to a colony. Years were required to\r\nreduce these evils; some of which are yet not unknown.\r\n\r\nThese were, however, small changes, compared with the total revolution\r\nin the spirit and details of convict management, suggested by the\r\nCommissioner. All those signs of advancement which he saw in the\r\nmaterial state of the colonies, in connection with the objects of\r\ntransportation, were anomalies in his eyes. He observed, that the\r\nprisoners were always anxious to reside in the towns, where they\r\nobtained, by casual labor, the price and opportunities of dissipation.\r\nBy a peremptory exercise of his authority, Mr. Bigge stopped some of the\r\npublic works, and promoted the dispersion of those multitudes who were\r\nemployed in the improvement of the capital.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner, strongly impressed with the mischief incident to the\r\ncongregation of prisoners in the presence of a free community, proposed\r\nseveral remedies. Among the most important was the establishment of\r\nsettlements, purely penal, at Port Curtis, Moreton Bay, and Port Bowen.\r\nThese places were explored by Mr. Oxley, the surveyor-general of the\r\ncolonies. Moreton Bay is situated 480 miles from Port Jackson: this\r\nregion, watered by the Brisbane, unequalled for climate and soil in any\r\npart of the globe of the same latitude; adorned with trees of\r\nmagnificent growth,[140] had nothing in its natural features to repel.\r\nThough the days are warm in summer (80 deg. to 100 deg.), the nights are cool,\r\nand for several months fires are agreeable. Bananas, plantains, and\r\npines--cotton, tobacco, maize, the sugar cane, and all the ordinary\r\nproductions of a tropical climate, are cultivated with success. The\r\natmosphere is soft and salubrious: of 1,200 persons, afterwards\r\nstationed there, sometimes not more than ten were sick at once; and\r\nduring seven years, one soldier only died.[141]\r\n\r\nSuch was the site chosen by Mr. Bigge; but he endeavoured to render it\r\nsuitable, by suggesting a code of regulations, in which may be\r\ndiscovered the outline of several schemes, since claiming originality.\r\nIt was intended for those convicted of serious crimes, or such as\r\ncommitted offences in the colonies. The prisoners, two together, were to\r\nbuild their own huts; their sole implement the hatchet, and their\r\nmaterial wood and nails: their only furniture, stools and bedding. Their\r\nlabor graduated; from removing heavy weights, and sawing the hardest\r\ntimber, to the easy occupation of the gardener, according to their\r\nbehaviour or their crimes. They were to raise their own provisions, and\r\nthe produce of their tillage for the crown, was to be sold in the\r\ncolonies, and carried to the public account; except a sixteenth part,\r\nthe moiety of which was to be paid to the commandant, and the rest\r\nproportionately to the overseers. No vessel, unauthorised, was to touch\r\nat the port: every precaution was projected to prevent escape, and the\r\nnatives were expected to bring back, for rewards, such as might venture\r\nto stray. Every crime, short of murder, was to be punished on the spot.\r\nNo spirits were to be sold; no money circulated; no private speculations\r\nin produce permitted. The wives of prisoners, when suffered to join\r\nthem, were to sacrifice all but the necessaries of life. From the chief\r\nsettlement others were to branch off; fifteen miles distant from each\r\nother. A church, a school, a library, were to promote the reformation of\r\nthe prisoners--an object to be considered paramount to every other. Such\r\nwere the plans for a _City of Penitence_, projected by Bigge; and by\r\nwhich he expected, in several directions, to dispose of 4,000 prisoners.\r\n\r\nIt was his hope, that their labor would discharge the chief cost of\r\ntheir control, and end the mockery, and the inequalities of punishment.\r\n\r\nBefore the arrival of the Commissioner, penal establishments existed,\r\nand prisoners were sequestered for violations of local regulations; or\r\non extensive farms, where grain was grown for the royal stores. At\r\nNewcastle, on the Hunter River, were coal mines (1818), where those\r\nunder colonial sentences, or those _guilty_ of experience in mining,\r\nwere subjected to a more rigorous servitude. By an onward progress of\r\nthe settlers, this station was less adapted for its purpose, and (1821)\r\na second was provided at Port Macquarie, 175 miles north of Port\r\nJackson. The increase of population soon rendered a further movement\r\nrequisite: it was not, however, until 1824, that Surveyor-general Oxley\r\ncompleted his report of Moreton Bay: pioneers were forwarded, and at\r\nlength 1,000 prisoners were employed in that remote region. The plan\r\nthus narrowed, only partially succeeded, and the numbers at last\r\ndwindled to 300 men: the Commissioner's idea, therefore, was never\r\nfairly tested. An organisation of several thousands in a city of\r\npenitence; under a discipline, which, while excluding the worst\r\ntemptations of regular society, might preserve many of its elementary\r\nforms; managed by permanent officers, in number and gradation,\r\nsufficient to form and preserve the tone of a profession--is\r\nunfortunately still a speculation: nor is it yet safe to assume, that\r\nthe failure of stations, exhibiting several features of the\r\nCommissioner's scheme, but excluding others not less important, is a\r\nconclusive argument against the original design.[142]\r\n\r\nIn this colony, a penal station was projected during the residence of\r\nBigge. While he approved the object, he did not cordially concur in the\r\nselected locality: he remarked several of those obstacles to access,\r\nwhich were not compensated by the difficulties of escape. The\r\npunishment of colonial offences, when persons were already in bonds,\r\nwas attended with some difficulty; the law not authorising additions to\r\na sentence, except by a court of criminal jurisdiction, regulated by the\r\nforms, and bounded by the limitations of English statutes. To punish a\r\nmisdemeanour, and sometimes even capital offences, the culprit was\r\nbrought before a justice of the peace, and sent to a penal settlement\r\nfor the remainder of his sentence. Thus a widely different penalty\r\nattended the different parties to the same crime: one would scarcely\r\ntouch the place of his second exile, before the termination of his\r\nBritish sentence restored him to full freedom; another, perhaps a\r\nprisoner for life, would linger out his wretched existence in the place\r\nof his seclusion, forgotten.[143]\r\n\r\nThe name of _Macquarie Harbour_ is associated exclusively with\r\nremembrance of inexpressible depravity, degradation, and woe. Sacred to\r\nthe genius of torture, nature concurred with the objects of its\r\nseparation from the rest of the world; to exhibit some notion of a\r\nperfect misery. There, man lost the aspect, and the heart of man!\r\n\r\nMacquarie Harbour was explored by Captain Kelly, at the expense of a\r\nmerchant whose name is borne by Birch's River, and that of his wife by\r\nSarah Island. It is an inlet of the sea, on the western coast: by water,\r\nabout 200 miles from Hobart Town. It penetrates the country twenty miles\r\nto its junction with Gordon River, where, diverging to the right, Sarah\r\nIsland becomes visible--once the principal station, now deserted and\r\ndesolate. This region is lashed with tempests; the sky is cloudy, and\r\nthe rain falls more frequently than elsewhere. In its chill and humid\r\nclimate animal life is preserved with difficulty: half the goats died in\r\none season, and sheep perish: vegetation, except in its coarsest or most\r\nmassive forms, is stunted and precarious. The torrents, which pour down\r\nthe mountains, mingle with decayed vegetable matter, and impregnated\r\nwith its acids discolour the waters of the harbour; and the fish that\r\napproach the coast, often rise on the waves, and float poisoned to the\r\nshores.[144]\r\n\r\nThe passage to this dreary dwelling place was tedious, and often\r\ndangerous. The prisoners, confined in a narrow space, were tossed for\r\nweeks on an agitated sea. As they approached, they beheld a narrow\r\nopening choked with a bar of sand, and crossed with peril.[145] This\r\nthey called \"Hell's gates,\"--not less appropriate to the place, than to\r\nthe character and torment of the inhabitants: beyond, they saw\r\nimpenetrable forests, skirted with an impervious thicket; and beyond\r\nstill, enormous mountains covered with snow, which rose to the clouds\r\nlike walls of adamant: every object wore the air of rigour, ferocity,\r\nand sadness.\r\n\r\nThe moment the prisoner landed, if the hours of labor had not expired,\r\nhe joined his gang. The chief employment was felling the forest, and\r\ndragging timber to the shore: these gigantic trees, formed into rafts,\r\nwere floated to the depot. In this service, life was sometimes lost; and\r\nthe miserable workmen, diseased and weakened by hunger, while performing\r\ntheir tasks, often passed hours in the water. They were long denied\r\nvegetables and fresh food: they were exposed to those maladies which\r\nresult from poverty of blood, and many remained victims long after their\r\nrelease. On a breakfast of flour and water, they started from their\r\nisland prison to the main land, and pursued their toil, without food,\r\ntill the hour of return: they then received their chief meal, and went\r\nto rest. Those who were separated to punishment still more severe,\r\nlodged on a rock: the surf dashed with perpetual violence on its base,\r\nand the men were compelled to pass through, wet to the waist, and even\r\nto the neck. They were destitute of bedding, sometimes in chains; their\r\nfires were extinguished, and they laid down in their clothes, in a cold\r\nand miserable resting place.[146]\r\n\r\nThey were subject to a single will; moved often by perjury, and\r\nsometimes by passion. One man, Alexander Anderson, a convict\r\noverseer,[147] delighted in human suffering--this was his qualification\r\nfor office; yet seventeen persons have been flogged in one day, at his\r\nsingle report. The instrument of torture was special; double twisted and\r\nknotted cords: 100 lashes were given, and repeated at short intervals.\r\nEven to repine was criminal: an expression of _anger from the sufferer_,\r\nwas a punishable offence: a second infliction has been known to follow,\r\nby a sentence on the spot.[148]\r\n\r\nThe alleviations of religious instruction were unknown. The commandant\r\nwas found, by the earliest clerical visitor, living in profligacy, and\r\nhe returned at once, despairing.[149] Women were, at first, sent there,\r\nand four were dispatched to gather shells, under the charge of one man,\r\nin whose hut they lodged. The forms of devotion depended on the surgeon,\r\nand were detested by the prisoners. They were, mostly, desperate men,\r\nand required a strong restraint; some were there, however, for offences\r\nof no deep die, who, while the least spark of humanity remained, felt\r\nthe association more horrible than the place. To escape this dread\r\nabode, they gambled for life; and, with the deliberation of actors,\r\ndivided the parts of a meditated murder, and sinister testimony. They\r\nloathed existence, and were willing to shorten its duration, if the\r\nexcitement of a voyage and a trial might precede the execution. It was\r\ntheir proverb, that all who entered there, gave up for ever the hope of\r\nHeaven.[150] Death lost its terrors, and when some unhappy victims were\r\nbrought down to terrify the rest, they saw them die as many see friends\r\ndepart on a desirable but distant journey.[151] Some were detained for\r\nyears by a succession of punishments; perhaps, for the possession of a\r\nfish-hook, of a potato, or an inch of tobacco. Some were flogged; until\r\nthis species of punishment lost, not only its terror, but its power: the\r\nremnant of the understanding settled down into one single faculty--the\r\nability to endure. It will be our painful task to turn to the results of\r\nthis experiment, since elsewhere repeated, of what nations can inflict,\r\nand man can suffer: excusable, had the Rhadamanthus of those regions\r\nbeen always just, and those subject to his lash always the worst of\r\ncriminals.[152]\r\n\r\nThe improvement of the assigned service, by raising the qualifications\r\nof the masters, and increasing the dependance of the men, was another\r\ngreat project of the Commissioner. There were, indeed, no employers,\r\nexcept those who had been convicts, or officers of government; and the\r\nfirst and larger class, possessed neither capital nor discretion. They\r\nwere rather patrons than masters. There were but two changes\r\npracticable: the vast establishments projected at Moreton Bay, and\r\nintroduction of a class of settlers, who might exercise the authority\r\nrequisite to restrain the vagrant indolence of the men; and whose\r\ncapital might give them constant employment and proper sustenance.\r\nSeveral military settlers, such as Macarthur, had large establishments,\r\nchiefly for cattle and sheep; and their management exemplified the\r\nsuperior facilities of control, where the men were both dispersed and\r\nguarded--divided in their occupations, but subject to a vigilant\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of the Commissioner that none, having small estates\r\nand trivial resources, should be placed in the responsible position of\r\nmasters; but that the inducements offered in former times should be\r\nrenewed and extended. He calculated, that the employers of convict\r\nlaborers, for each, relieved the treasury of England to the extent of\r\nL24 10s. per annum. Thus every consideration commended the system of\r\nassignment beyond any other. To attract the attention of settlers, he\r\nadvised that the emigrant should be entitled to a grant, to purchase an\r\naddition at a low price, and to receive a bonus in land, for the stock\r\nhe might rear, or according to the industry and skill he might otherwise\r\nexhibit.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated, that the ministers who founded these colonies,\r\nintended that free emigration should accompany transportation with equal\r\nsteps. The despatches of Governor Phillip, addressed to the secretary of\r\nstate[153] in 1790, proved that he felt the want, and perceived the\r\nvalue, of such auxiliaries; but the early determination to raise\r\nexpirees to the condition of landholders, seems to imply the form the\r\nsettlement at Port Jackson was expected to assume. It is obvious that\r\nthe immediate design of the Governor, was to provide such free settlers,\r\nas might act in different official capacities, at little or no\r\nexpense.[154] The reply to these communications was favorable, and the\r\nprospect of emigration cheering; but the result was insignificant. It is\r\nstated by Collins, that several families, members of the Society of\r\nFriends, proposed to accept the offers of government, but were deterred\r\nby the reputation of the colony, and the disorders which prevailed.[155]\r\n\r\nThe _Bellona_ at length arrived, with free settlers and their families,\r\nincluding a millwright and blacksmith; one of whom had been already in\r\nthe colony, under other auspices! An authority to the Governor was now\r\nconveyed, to establish such persons as were eligible on terms highly\r\nadvantageous. They chose a fertile spot, and to mark their civil\r\ncondition, called their locations \"Liberty Plains\" (February, 1793). The\r\nBritish government provided their passage, an assortment of tools and\r\nimplements, provisions for two years; their lands free of expense; and\r\nthe service of convicts, with two years' rations and one year's\r\nclothing. It is difficult to imagine a more alluring offer; yet, except\r\na Dorsetshire farmer, the rest were not _bona fide_ settlers: two\r\nformerly belonged to the _Sirius_, and a third to the _Lady Juliana_\r\ntransport; in short, they were sailors. Concluding, then, the secretary\r\nof state had sought settlers in earnest, the presumption is strong that\r\nno considerable number of persons could be found to engage in such an\r\nenterprise: one which seemed to comprehend all the perils of distance,\r\nof official tyranny, and of social corruption.[156]\r\n\r\nThe additions, thus made to the free population, were generally of\r\npersons connected with the merchant service or the military profession;\r\nand who, by a residence intended only to be temporary and official,\r\ncontracted a preference for the climate; where they found great respect\r\nand deference, by the paucity of their numbers.

Each individual will be _required to furnish quarterly, a\r\ndeclaration upon honor to this effect_, to the commandant, who will\r\ncertify that the whole of the officers borne upon the salary abstract,\r\nhave furnished the same.\r\n\r\n\"No officer, or other free person, shall be allowed to cultivate any\r\nground on his own account, excepting for the purpose of a garden, for\r\nthe exclusive supply of his own family.\r\n\r\n\"No officer shall be allowed to raise stock of any description for sale,\r\nor for any other purpose than the immediate use of his own family; such\r\nstock to consist exclusively of pigs and poultry, which shall be secured\r\nwithin the premises of the proprietor.\r\n\r\n\"No officer, or other person, shall be allowed to employ any convict at\r\nany time whatever for his personal advantage, or otherwise than on the\r\npublic account, excepting always such men as may be appropriated to his\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\"No officer, or other free person, is on any account to leave the\r\nsettlement, without the written sanction of the commandant.\r\n\r\n\"The commandant is vested with full authority to remove, at his\r\ndiscretion, any free person from the settlement, whose conduct shall\r\nappear to him to render this proceeding necessary for the due\r\nmaintenance of discipline.\r\n\r\n\"The officers, and other free persons, shall be allowed to purchase\r\ngrain from the public stores, to maintain the livestock they are\r\npermitted to keep, according to the following scale:--\r\n\r\n\"Commandant, not to exceed five bushels per month; civil and military\r\nofficers, three bushels per month; inferior free persons, one bushel per\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\"To enable the officers of the settlement to cultivate their gardens,\r\nthey shall be allowed to have convicts appropriated to their service in\r\nthe following proportion:--\r\n\r\n\"Commandant, three men; military and civil officers, two ditto.\r\n\r\n\"These men are not to be mechanics or tradesmen, and are to be allowed\r\nin addition to any servants they may have been permitted to take with\r\nthem to the settlement.\r\n\r\n\"When work is required to be done by the mechanics for the absolute\r\ncomfort and convenience of any of the officers on the settlement, the\r\nfollowing regulations shall be observed:--\r\n\r\n\"The officer to make a written requisition, which will, if approved by\r\nthe commandant, be given to the overseer of the mechanics, who will\r\nreceive the whole of the materials from the officer.

In this\r\ncase the commandant will permit his being temporarily employed in his\r\ntrade, or on any of the public works.\r\n\r\n\"Prisoners of the first class, who shall be selected by the commandant\r\nfor constables or overseers, will be allowed the usual distinction of\r\ndress, and shall receive in addition to their rations, two pounds of\r\nflour per week, and one ounce of tobacco; but in no case shall any\r\nconvict at a penal settlement be allowed to receive a pecuniary reward.\r\n\r\n\"As a further encouragement to constables and overseers to be faithful\r\nand diligent in the discharge of their duty, two years' service as a\r\nconstable or overseer, shall be considered equivalent to three years'\r\nservitude on the settlement; but in case of misconduct, they shall\r\nforfeit all such benefit arising from their services as constables or\r\noverseers.\r\n\r\n\"As there may be found some individuals whose conduct may be deserving\r\nof reward, but who nevertheless may not be qualified to fill the\r\nsituation of overseers, the commandant will transmit annually to the\r\ncolonial secretary, a return of the names of such convicts who, having\r\nserved two-thirds of the period of their sentence, may by a long\r\ncontinuance of good conduct, be considered to merit indulgence. To this\r\nreturn there shall be annexed a detailed statement of the circumstances\r\nwhich have induced the commandant to recommend the individuals\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\"A return will in like manner be transmitted by the commandant, of any\r\nprisoners under sentence for life, who shall have conducted themselves\r\nto his entire satisfaction for six years (or of capital respites for ten\r\nyears) after their arrival in the settlement, annexing, as before, a\r\ndetailed statement of the circumstances which have induced him to\r\nrecommend the individuals respectively; and should the governor be\r\nsatisfied that they are deserving of reward, his excellency will\r\nmitigate their sentence to that of seven or fourteen years, from the\r\ndate of such mitigation; after which the individuals will, of course, be\r\neligible to all the privileges of prisoners of the first class.\r\n\r\n\"The wife of a convict shall, in no case, be allowed to join her\r\nhusband, until he shall have been placed in the first class, and the\r\ncommandant shall have recommended him for this indulgence.\r\n\r\n\"The wives and children of convicts shall be allowed rations and slop\r\nclothing from the public stores.\r\n\r\n\"The wives and children of convicts are not to be allowed to convey\r\nmoney or property of any kind to the settlement, nor to possess any live\r\nstock or poultry, and they are strictly to be prohibited from carrying\r\non any trade or traffic in the settlement; but they will be furnished\r\nwith employment in spinning flax, making straw hats or bonnets, making\r\nup slops, and such other work as they may be capable of performing, the\r\nmaterials for which will be supplied from the government store. They\r\nwill receive credit in the books of the settlement, at the market or\r\nfactory prices, on such work being returned to the stores; and the\r\namount of their earnings will be annually placed in the savings bank, to\r\nbe received by them on their return from the settlement, as a means of\r\nsupport on their arrival.\r\n\r\n\"Married convicts, whose families have been permitted to join them,\r\nshall be allowed to live in separate huts.\r\n\r\n\"A portion of ground shall be allotted as a prisoners' garden, the\r\nextent of which shall be determined by the commandant.\r\n\r\n\"If any money or property shall be found in possession of a convict, or\r\nthe family of a convict, it shall be seized and forfeited to the\r\nBenevolent Asylum.\r\n\r\n\"The labor of all convicts, excepting only those assigned to the\r\nofficers, shall be wholly and exclusively applied to the service of the\r\nsettlement generally, and the indulgence of working on their own\r\naccount, after the usual hours of public labor, shall be strictly\r\nprohibited.\r\n\r\n\"No convict shall be allowed to wear any other clothing than that which\r\nis issued to him by the government; and the number of each convict on\r\nthe settlement is to be painted on each article of his dress, before and\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\"The commandant will see that due attention is paid to the cleanliness\r\nof the convicts, and that those whose state of health admit of it, bathe\r\nregularly.\r\n\r\n\"A separate barrack is to be provided for the female convicts; and if\r\nemployed in field labor, they are to be kept separate from the men.\r\n\r\n\"A washing gang from among the female convicts shall be appointed, to\r\nwash and mend the clothes, and air the blankets and palliasses of the\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n\"The convicts are not to be allowed to possess knives or any sharp\r\ninstruments; the knives, forks, and spoons, are to be under the charge\r\nof the barrack overseer, and he will be held responsible that they are\r\nduly collected from each convict before he is allowed to quit his seat\r\nat the mess table. This, however, is not to apply to those married\r\nconvicts or overseers, who shall have been allowed to live in separate\r\nhuts.\r\n\r\n\"The whole of the convicts will be mustered on Sunday morning, arranged\r\nin their several gangs, and attended by their respective overseers and\r\nconstables, when they will be inspected by the commandant. The wives and\r\nfamilies of the convicts will also be required to attend the Sunday\r\nmorning musters.\r\n\r\n\"The prisoners will be mustered daily by the superintendent of convicts,\r\nat sunrise, before they proceed to labor, when they return to meals, and\r\nagain when the work for the day is closed.\r\n\r\n\"No convict shall be allowed to receive or transmit any letter,\r\nexcepting through the commandant, who is to exercise his discretion in\r\nopening such letters, and perusing their contents.\r\n\r\n\"The section regulating the discipline and employment of the convicts,\r\nis to be read once in every month to the troops and convicts on the\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n\"These regulations shall be entered in the public order books of the\r\nsettlement, and they are to be strictly and literally adhered to\r\nthroughout; no deviation being permitted, except in cases of very great\r\nemergency, which are to be determined alone by the commandant, who will\r\nimmediately report in detail his reasons for such deviation to the\r\ngovernor, in order that his excellency's sanction to the measure may be\r\nobtained.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: \"The crimes for which they were sent down, were\r\noriginally trifling: five or six for a robbery, petty theft, or\r\ndisobedience to orders.

Walker,\r\nthe author has been given to understand, that neither he nor his\r\ncolleague, Mr. Backhouse, ever heard of this projected emigration. The\r\ncorrespondence upon the subject would probably disclose more clearly the\r\nultimate views of the imperial government. Dr. Laing assigns, for the\r\nrelinquishment of the project, a refusal to extend the laws of England\r\nto the settlement,--but gives no authority.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION X.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the Commissioner's propositions was embodied by the home\r\ngovernment, and its offers were published in various forms; chiefly,\r\nindeed, by the diligence of adventurers who, to freight their ships,\r\nfilled volumes, and depicted in lively colors the beauty of the\r\ncolonies. The intending settler was told, that not only would he find\r\ncheap land and cheap labor, but a large return for his produce.\r\n\r\nBy the grants of Sir Thomas Brisbane, bonds were required to be given\r\nfor the support and employment of prisoners, until their detention\r\nexpired--calculated at the average term of ten years. For every hundred\r\nacres, the settler engaged to provide one convict with food and\r\nclothing, in return for his labor; and to contribute 18s. per annum\r\ntowards the expense of medicine, police, and religious instruction\r\n(1822). Still further to encourage such contracts, the settlers were\r\nfurnished with a cow, for every convict attached to their grants, to\r\ncontinue in their possession during the term of his servitude![157]\r\n\r\nThe regulation issued at Downing-street in 1824, engaged that the\r\npurchaser of land--who within ten years might save ten times the amount\r\nof his payment, by the employment of convicts, reckoning each at L16 per\r\nannum--should receive back his money, though without interest; but when\r\nthe land was conditionally given, one-fifth part of that saving would\r\npass to account of quit-rent, and thus probably entitle the employer to\r\nentire relief.\r\n\r\nThe Van Diemen's Land Company, by agreement with Earl Bathurst, entered\r\ninto similar covenants, and received their land subject to a quit-rent,\r\nredeemable by the sustentation and employment of prisoners--to them a\r\nfortunate stipulation,[158] and which has relieved their vast territory\r\nfrom a heavy pressure. These various plans indicate the difficulties of\r\nfinding masters, which once prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe government having roused the spirit of emigration, were soon enabled\r\nto grant a favor when they assigned a workman, and rapidly withdrew from\r\nengagements no longer necessary. Hundreds of families arrived in a\r\nsuccession of vessels, and speedily fixed themselves in the interior:\r\nflocks were contracted, herds were slaughtered; fences, homesteads, and\r\nfields of corn divided and dotted the land. The least capital admitted\r\nwas L500; and though several evaded the condition, many of the settlers\r\nbrought much larger sums. They pursued their improvements, with all the\r\nvigour awakened by novelty, and stimulated by the prospect of\r\nconsiderable gains. The competition for labor increased, until it\r\ncreated in the minds of the settlers a feeling of dependance and\r\nobligation--to refuse a supply, had been ruin. It placed before the\r\nprisoners, once again, the examples of emancipist opulence: mechanics\r\nearned more wages than officers of the army; again transportation was\r\nrepresented as a boon; and then came other changes.\r\n\r\nIn the official newspaper of 1827, it is stated that 1,000 applications\r\nwere registered at Hobart Town. To an English reader, and to a modern\r\ncolonist, the notices of this period seem like satire. \"Better,\" remarks\r\nthis organ of the higher classes, \"better send petitions for more\r\nprisoners--now that applications have lain dormant for twelve months:\r\nsome for four, eight, and ten men--than trouble about trial by jury and\r\nrepresentative government. The disappointment, we trust, will be\r\ntemporary: when the last vessel sailed, the _York_ was freighting. We\r\ntrust the home secretary will consider the deficiency\"! The extremely\r\nearnest manner in which these felonious additions were implored, is a\r\ncurious relic of a bygone era.[159]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: _Collins_, vol. i. p. 267.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: _Gazette_, 11th July, 1822.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: Bischcoff.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XI.\r\n\r\nThe system of assignment was first established in America (1718), and\r\ncontinued for fifty-six years: the rigid discipline permitted by the\r\ncolonial law, the kind of labor usually performed by the servants, and\r\ntheir diffusion over an extensive surface, tended alike to restrain, to\r\nreform, and ultimately to merge them undistinguished. Many, endowed with\r\ngood natural abilities, such as an accomplished thief usually possesses,\r\nsucceeded in their pursuits, and became masters themselves, _by the\r\npurchase_ of the servitude of those afterwards sent out for sale.[160]\r\nThus, whatever complaints were raised against transportation itself,\r\nnone objected to assignment; and the long period of its duration, proves\r\nthat the home government cared little for the state of prisoners, while\r\nthere was no local press to vindicate their _rights_, and few readers of\r\nbooks to encourage romantic delineations of their _felicity_.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of a vessel, the chief officers of the government\r\nexamined the prisoners, and the Governor himself addressed them. He\r\npointed out their future position, their duties, and their dangers; the\r\ntone of promise usual in times past was considerably abated, but the\r\nawful rigours of their servitude were explained, often to their\r\nastonishment and horror.[161] Often the private examination of the\r\nprisoner confounded him with amazement: a gentleman, whom he had never\r\nseen before, unravelled with facility the mystery of his life. If he had\r\nbeen often in prison; if his brother had been transported; if his\r\nsweetheart had been deserted; whether he had been a pest to the lords of\r\nthe manor, or to the parish, by poaching or bastardy: his whole life was\r\nread by his inquisitor, with supernatural clearness. The raw countryman\r\ndid not know how far his course had been subject to the gaze of the\r\nstranger: denial gave way rapidly; he assented, and explained, and\r\nenlarged--and thus the office of the superintendent answered the purpose\r\nof a confessional. It was the practice to furnish all possible\r\ninformation to the local government, and to keep its details a secret\r\nfrom the prisoners: such had been the advice of the Commissioner. Thus\r\nthe wonder of the country transport, to find that the picture of his\r\nlife had preceded him--that all was known at the world's end.\r\n\r\nThough no persons could have greater cause to confuse their identity,\r\nthe prisoners often stamped on their persons indelible distinctions; a\r\ncustom, perhaps, introduced by the sailors, and encouraged by the\r\nofficers, but which prevailed among London thieves. Those who suffered\r\nthese figures to be pierced, were usually the most simple minded, or the\r\nmost depraved. The figures themselves were sometimes obscene, but not\r\ncommonly: often mermaids, still more frequently hearts and darts;\r\nsometimes the name, or the initials of the prisoner. Thus, in the\r\nrunaway notices (1825), one had a hope and anchor; another, a castle,\r\nflower pots, hearts and darts; another, a man and woman, a heart and a\r\nlaurel; another, a masonic arch, and moon and stars, and initials in\r\nabundance. An Irishman had a crucifix on the arm, a cross on the right\r\nhand, and the figure of a woman on the breast! Such were the ingenious\r\nmethods which, induced by indolence and vanity, these men permitted, to\r\nlessen the chances of escape. The initials generally differed from those\r\nof the known name, and indicated that the wearer, some time or other,\r\nhad occasion for disguise: others were obviously memorials of past\r\naffection, and of names perhaps associated with blighted hopes and better\r\ndays. Besides these marks, were others; scars, usually the result of\r\na life of mingled intemperance and violence: thus, almost in succession,\r\nthe list of absconders gives the following--\"a scar on the forehead;\"\r\n\"scar on the right eye;\" \"his arm has been broken;\" \"his nose inclines\r\nto the left cheek;\" \"a broken nose.\"[162]\r\n\r\nAll that might assist the police was registered: their native place,\r\ntheir age, their crime, and sentence. They were then detached to their\r\nmasters; marched, sometimes, in considerable bodies, from Kangaroo Point\r\nto Launceston, 120 miles. The mechanics were reserved for government\r\nemploy, and the concealment of a trade, was visited as a crime; yet\r\nconvicts did conceal their trade, instructed by former experience, or a\r\nhint from a veteran predecessor. They knew that mechanical knowledge\r\nmight prolong their detention, and deprive them of many present\r\nadvantages. They knew that, though rated as laborers, they might obtain\r\na master who would pay them. This was effected, sometimes, at once, or\r\nby the agency of a friend; or oftener by the prisoner, who, on his first\r\nopportunity, would hint to a builder or carpenter, that he knew\r\nsomething of a trade. An order was obtained for a _laborer_, which would\r\nnot have been spared for a mechanic: a fee to the clerk, secured the\r\nintended selection; and the man assigned to carry the materials of a\r\nbuilding, was taught, in a time which seemed incredibly short, all the\r\nmysteries of line and rule. It is thus that weakness ever arms itself\r\nagainst might.\r\n\r\nThe increased demand for assigned servants, enabled Governor Arthur to\r\nenforce the regulations which had been often promulgated in vain. It\r\nceased to be necessary to pay wages, and the master was bound to provide\r\nsufficient food and clothing for his men: the scale was determined. The\r\npractice of lending out servants was restricted, and finally abolished.\r\nAll those means of stimulating labor, which had tended to suggest the\r\nrights of property, were forbidden. It had been the custom to permit\r\nassigned servants to receive a share in the increase of stock;\r\nallotments of land had been separated to their exclusive use; they had\r\nbeen suffered to trade upon their own account. These arrangements were\r\ncalculated to stimulate industry, but they also generated disputes, and\r\nled to petty theft. Thus reduced to an absolute dependance upon the\r\nliberality of their masters, they had no reward but as a boon: many of\r\nwhom, however, evaded the regulations, and paid their servants the\r\nordinary wages of free men.\r\n\r\nNo rule can be devised, that is not liable to objection. The men were\r\ndiscontented with a service, in which money was refused them: it was\r\nillegally possessed, and therefore rapidly spent in debauchery and\r\ndrunkenness. The settlers usually allowed some luxuries; but these,\r\ndiscretionally given, were a tax to the liberal, often more onerous than\r\nreasonable wages. Domestic servants, and those entrusted with important\r\nconcerns, were paid by all, from the Governor downwards, and that while\r\nregulations were promulgated against such violations of order.[163] It\r\nwas doubtless not at his direction, but at his cost!\r\n\r\nA decision at Sydney, explained the nature of the claim for wages\r\ngranted by former regulations of government. A female, at the close\r\nof a long servitude, sued her master for arrears: the judge advocate\r\ndeclared \"his court one of equity and right,\" not of law; that\r\nthe spirit of public orders, not their letter, was the rule of judgment;\r\nthat the allowance of money required by the crown, was intended to\r\nsecure the plaintiff certain comforts: those comforts she had already\r\nenjoyed, and thus her claim in equity had been already satisfied (1823).\r\nThe wages of a man servant were stopped by the magistrates, because he\r\nhad been accused of stealing from his master (1821)!\r\n\r\nThe right of a master in the services of his assigned servant, was\r\nincidentally raised in the celebrated case of Jane New. She arrived in\r\nVan Diemen's Land under a sentence of transportation, and, according to\r\nthe prevailing custom, was assigned to her husband; who was allowed, by\r\nGovernor Arthur, to remove her to New South Wales: she was charged there\r\nwith a capital felony, and death was recorded against her. The\r\nprosecutrix, Madle. Senns, a French mantua-maker, gave her evidence by\r\nan interpreter: afterwards, it was discovered, that the conviction was\r\nerroneous, both _in substance_ and _in law_: released on the\r\nrecommendation of the judges, by order of the sheriff she was committed\r\nto the female factory at Parramatta. Her husband then sued out a writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_, to which the return, as amended by the direction of the\r\ncourt, alleged under the hand of the colonial secretary, that her\r\ndetention was by authority of Governor Darling, she being a prisoner of\r\nthe crown. The question seemed to depend on the nature of the rights\r\nconveyed by assignment; but a second arose: whether those rights could\r\nbe exercised beyond the limits of the territory appointed for the\r\ntransportation; or whether Governor Arthur was authorised to permit the\r\nremoval. The judges, Forbes, Stephen, and Dowling, decided that the\r\nprisoner having been transported to Van Diemen's Land, was, by removal\r\nto Port Jackson, no longer under the provisions of the act of\r\nparliament; that neither the magistrates nor Governor of New South\r\nWales, could make her the subject of summary treatment; but as a\r\nprisoner illegally at large, must remand her to the place of her\r\noriginal and unsatisfied term of transportation.\r\n\r\nIn giving this decision, the judges announced their opinion upon the\r\nrights of assignment in general, as regulated by the 9th Geo. iv. cap.\r\n83. The Act required the consent of the governor in the assignment of a\r\nprisoner, and authorised the revocation of that assignment: this power\r\nto revoke, was however, to enable the governor to grant remission--to\r\nchange the civil condition of the servant; and thus, by his restoration\r\nto liberty, to extinguish the rights of the assignee. The law officers,\r\non the part of government, alleged that the discretion was absolute, and\r\nauthorised a summary disposal of the services of the prisoner; whether\r\nunder, or independent of, a magisterial decision.\r\n\r\nThe chief justice, however, maintained that such a right in the\r\nexecutive might be ruin to the people. He asserted, that the duty and\r\nright of the governor was limited to the execution of a public trust, as\r\nbetween the crown on one side and the prisoner on the other; to minister\r\nto a covenant, subject only to those stipulations, the neglect of which\r\nmight, by the common rights of humanity, dissolve the engagement. \"If,\"\r\nhe remarked, \"the governor, at discretion, may revoke the assignment of\r\nprisoners, as a consequence he may render the estates of landholders of\r\nno value; nor does it appear that this power of revocation is\r\nsustainable under any circumstances in the large and discretionary form\r\nclaimed by the law officers of the crown.\"[164]\r\n\r\nThe government endeavoured to contest this right (1829), in the instance\r\nof Mr. Hall, publisher of the _Monitor_, whose strictures had provoked\r\nofficial hostility. His men were recalled by the superintendent; he,\r\nhowever, paid no attention to the notice, and continued to employ them:\r\nfor this he was summoned before the bench of magistrates, who,\r\ninfluenced by the known opinions of the government, fined him, under the\r\nact against harbouring. Mr. Wentworth moved for a criminal information\r\nagainst Messrs. Berry, Wollstoncraft, and others, for contempt: a rule\r\nwas granted, but afterwards dismissed; the judges expressing the\r\nstrongest indignation that the magistrates had dared to set aside the\r\nsolemn decision of the court on a point of law, and in reference to the\r\nmost important rights of the colonists; and to mark their displeasure,\r\nthey saddled them with all the costs. Mr. Hayes, of the _Australian_,\r\nwas involved in a similar contest; but to break the bond, the governor\r\ngranted a ticket-of-leave--thus releasing the prisoner from his\r\nassignment. The printer, notwithstanding, brought his action against the\r\nsuperintendent for abduction, and gained damages; the judges holding,\r\nthat the sudden deprivation of the master, by an arbitrary and unusual\r\nindulgence--granted only to deprive him of his rights as assignee--was\r\nnot contemplated in the law, which modified those rights by the\r\nprerogative of mercy.\r\n\r\nThe following are the chief provisions of the Parliamentary Acts on the\r\nsubject of assignment:--\r\n\r\nThe 4th Geo. i. (1717) conveyed an absolute property to the shipper, who\r\nagain assigned to the master.\r\n\r\nAn opinion was obtained from the law officers of the crown (about 1818),\r\nthat the state of convict servitude was created by the 4th Geo. i. and\r\nsubsequent statutes, under which a property in the servant was reserved\r\nto the master, whether captain or colonist: the power to punish was\r\nassumed as a necessary consequence.[165]\r\n\r\nThe 5th Geo. iv. gave a right to the governors to release the convict\r\nfrom assignment, by a pardon, &c. A subsequent Act, for abolishing the\r\npunishment of death in certain cases, limited the exercise of mercy.\r\n\r\nThe 9th Geo. iv. gave the governor power to revoke assignment; and made\r\nthe master entirely dependant on the government.\r\n\r\nThe local government rarely interfered with the prescriptive rights of\r\nthe masters, nor did it often object to the transfer of servants when\r\nthe value of an estate depended on the possession of bond labor. The\r\nmost remarkable deviation from this policy was in the instance of Mr.\r\nWilliam Bryan, a gentleman of considerable wealth, who was dismissed\r\nfrom the magistracy, and deprived of all his servants in one day (1833).\r\nRelying on the decision of the judges of New South Wales, he threatened\r\nan action, but the law of assignment being changed,[166] it was quite\r\nwithin the province of the Governor to recall a servant at any hour. The\r\ndiscretion of the executive was never brought into legal question; but\r\nthe deprivation of a colonist in the midst of harvest, without public\r\ninquiry into any alleged malversation, taught the settlers that their\r\nfortunes were in the hands of the Governor. A London pickpocket required\r\na long course of instruction; but his services were no longer secure to\r\nhis master--a serious drawback from their worth.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of servants, once convenient to the government, lasted\r\nuntil 1838, when it was finally abolished. It had been agreed by a\r\nsettler, named Silcock, to transfer a servant to Mr. Theodore Bartley:\r\non the application an endorsement was written--\"the consent of the\r\nservant is, in all cases, necessary.\" This led to a long correspondence,\r\nin which several colonists took part. The settlers contended that, to\r\nrequire the servant's consent, was inconsistent with his civil\r\ncondition; \"tended to weaken the sense of submission and control,\" and\r\nraise him into a dispenser of favors. A large amount of polite\r\nrecrimination enlivened this dispute, which perhaps ended as was\r\nbest--the last bond was broken.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: _Courier_, 1829.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: Colquhoun.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: Arthur's evidence: _Par.

The efforts to escape from that dreary region had been numerous,\r\nbut unsuccessful: the unhappy beings who wandered into the woods, found\r\nno sustenance, and died either from exhaustion or by the hands of each\r\nother; or when they endeavoured to ford the Gordon, and attain by a more\r\ndirect course the settled districts, they were either drowned or taken.\r\nDuring the first five years, when not more than two hundred were\r\nconfined there, one hundred ventured on this dangerous enterprise,\r\nnotwithstanding their ignorance of the route, and the almost certain\r\nstarvation which awaited them. Prisoners arriving from Hobart Town gave\r\nthem erroneous tidings respecting the absconders, and delusive hopes of\r\nsuccess, and thus the foolish and desperate were prompted to hazard the\r\nperils of flight.\r\n\r\nThe first (1822) adventurers were John Green and Joseph Sanders; never\r\nheard of more: six others followed a few days after, and encountered a\r\nsimilar fate. They were pursued by two soldiers and three prisoners, who\r\ntook with them a fortnight's provision and hunting dogs. The rain\r\ncontinued for seven weeks after their departure, and it was presumed\r\nthey perished from exhaustion.[167] Another party formed a catamaran,\r\nbut it parted when they had proceeded a short distance; and they were\r\nrescued from its fragments by the soldiers. Eight others left in the\r\nfollowing September, and all lost their lives, except Pearce, whose\r\nnarrative will be noticed hereafter.\r\n\r\nAt Macquarie Harbour, the first commandant was Lieutenant Cuthbertson, a\r\nsoldier who had been in eighteen general engagements; yet was glad of an\r\nappointment, to supplement the deficiency of his pay. His discipline was\r\nsevere, but of brief duration. A small vessel, built at the harbour, was\r\nin danger, and Cuthbertson ordered out his own boat to its relief; this\r\nhe effected: on returning, his boat was upset, and all, except two, were\r\ndrowned. Cuthbertson was thrice raised by one of the crew; but finding\r\nhis strength unequal to retain his hold, he said, \"man, save yourself;\r\nnever mind me--it is no use.\" On the death of the commandant, the chief\r\nauthority devolved on a non-commissioned officer. The prisoners were\r\ndisposed to question his right to obedience: his government was\r\nvigorous, and he flogged with redoubled frequency.[168]\r\n\r\nIn June, 1824, two parties absconded from Macquarie Harbour: one,\r\nconsisting of three persons only, who seized the soldiers' boat,\r\nprovisions, and arms. They proceeded about twelve miles, when they\r\nmoored the boat to a stump of a tree, and wrote on its stern with chalk,\r\n\"to be sold:\" of this party no tidings were ever heard, and it is\r\nsupposed that they perished. The second left five days afterwards, and\r\nwere, for a time, more fortunate. Having resolved to escape, they\r\nproposed to capture the barge of commandant Wright; but suspecting their\r\nintention, he pushed off before they could reach it, leaving behind the\r\nsurgeon. This gentleman they threatened to flog, and prepared the\r\ninstrument of punishment; Brady interposed, and thus began his fatal\r\ncareer by an act of gratitude. He had experienced some kindness from the\r\nsurgeon when a patient, and forgave his official attendance at the\r\ntriangles. These men were usually friendly to the doctors: another\r\nmedical gentleman, afterwards taken prisoner by Brady and his gang, was\r\nallowed to retain his lancet, and treated with respect, although robbed\r\nof his money. A few days before, he had released one of the party from\r\npunishment, by alleging his physical inability. It was thus in the power\r\nof the surgeons to favor the prisoners, and to mitigate the sentence of\r\na rigorous magistrate.\r\n\r\nThe party having obtained a boat, proceeded towards the Derwent, and\r\nwere pursued by Lucas, the pilot, without success. They left on the 9th,\r\nand appeared on the east coast of the Derwent on the 18th June, at the\r\nresidence of Mr. Mason: having beaten him with great violence and\r\ncruelty, they next robbed a servant of Mr. Gunn of fire-arms. They were\r\npursued by this officer, and five were captured. These were instantly\r\nplaced on their trial, and were desirous of pleading guilty; but courts\r\nhave always manifested dislike to such evasions of trial, and they\r\nretracted, on the persuasion of the chief justice. They attempted to\r\nextenuate their crimes by the hardships they had suffered, but in vain.\r\n\r\nThe advice to a person accused to plead not guilty, though anomalous in\r\nits aspect, is yet usually a proper protection to the ignorant and\r\ndefenceless: such, under an impression of general guilt, might admit an\r\naggravated indictment, and lose the advantage of those distinctions made\r\nby legislators on public grounds, between crime and crime; or the\r\nexecutive might delude a prisoner with fallacious hopes of mercy, to\r\nprevent the disclosure of extenuating facts to conceal official wrong;\r\nwhile ignorance of the details of a crime, might destroy the moral\r\nweight of exemplary punishment.\r\n\r\nWith these men was executed Alexander Pearce, whose confessions to the\r\npriest were, by his consent, published at his death. He formed one of\r\nthe second party who absconded from Macquarie Harbour (1822). They had\r\nplanned their escape with considerable skill: one was a sailor, and able\r\nto direct their course: they possessed themselves of a boat, and\r\nproposed to capture the vessel of the pilot, then laden for town. It was\r\nthe custom, when a prisoner was missing, to kindle signal fires along\r\nthe coast, thus giving notice to the sentinels: to prevent such\r\ninformation, the absconders poured water on the embers kept in\r\nreadiness. This was not effectually done: and thus, when they had\r\nproceeded half-a-mile, they saw the smoke rising, and their passage cut\r\noff; they therefore landed, destroyed the boat, and entered the bush.\r\nThey now commenced a course of fatigue and horror: they began to murmur,\r\nand then to discuss the terrible alternative of general starvation:\r\ntwo, who overheard the proposition, returned to the settlement, but died\r\nalmost immediately, from exhaustion. The rest travelled on, lessened at\r\nvarious stages in their course by their fatal necessity, till two only\r\nsurvived; these were, Pearce and Greenhill--the last, the victim. They\r\nspent two days and nights watching each other! Greenhill, who laid his\r\naxe under his head, to guard against surprise, first slept! Pearce was\r\nnow alone, and destitute; but at length he came to a fire of the\r\nnatives, and obtained some fragments of the opossum: at last he reached\r\na flock of sheep, and seized on a lamb, which he proceeded to devour\r\nundressed. He was discovered by a stock-keeper, and when he surrendered\r\nwas received with great kindness and sympathy. His host introduced him\r\nto the bushrangers then abroad; but being afterwards captured, he was\r\nagain forwarded to Macquarie Harbour.\r\n\r\nSuch suffering might have been expected to overcome all future desire to\r\nabscond; yet, in company with Cox, Pearce again left the settlement:\r\nthey remained several days in the neighbourhood, and then attempted to\r\nreach the northern part of the island. Pearce slew his unsuspecting\r\ncomrade. Horror took possession of his mind; or, despairing to effect\r\nhis escape, he returned and made signals to the _Waterloo_, then passing\r\nthe coast. He confessed his crime, and professed a wish to die.[169]\r\n\r\nThese cases indicate the rapid process by which the habits of\r\ncannibalism are formed: the details of his trial were given in the\r\n_Gazettes_ of the period, and are contained in the parliamentary papers;\r\nbut who could bear to examine the diary of such a journey, or to\r\ndescribe the particulars of those sacrifices which fill the soul with\r\nunutterable loathing!\r\n\r\nArrests were constantly made, but did not diminish the number, or daring\r\nof new adventurers. Their exploits were contagious: many fled from the\r\nemploy of government, and the service of settlers, and forfeited their\r\nlives after a short career. An instance will show the extent of their\r\noperations. By his spies the police magistrate was aware that a large\r\nquantity of goods would be offered to a certain person for sale, whom he\r\ninstructed to purchase, and to pay partly by check and partly in cash.\r\nAt midnight he surrounded a house in Hobart Town, with soldiers and\r\nconstables: there he found the men he sought--their arms, their plunder,\r\nand the check. They had pillaged the dwelling of Mr. Haywood at the\r\nMacquarie, a district rarely free from depredations. One of the robbers\r\nwas formerly, and a second more lately, in the service of the\r\nprosecutor, and a third was a neighbour. They had entered, by pretending\r\nto deliver a message, and assaulted both Mr. Haywood and his wife: they\r\nfired several shots, and left them with threats. They were promptly\r\ntried and executed.\r\n\r\nNot long after, the same establishment was visited by Brady: he took but\r\nlittle, and assured the prosecutor he need not fear retaliation, for\r\nBroadhead, the leader of the last party, _was not a bushranger_!\r\nEighteen were taken in one week, but they increased with equal rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, baffled by their lengthened defiance of the efforts to\r\nquell them, attributed cowardice and corruption with an unsparing\r\nbitterness; yet the difficulties even of the well-disposed were great,\r\nand they were often ignorant of the movements of the robbers. Their\r\nretreats were often in the forests, and known only to themselves; and at\r\nsome future time property will be detected, the relics of early robbers,\r\nwho carried with them to the grave the secret of their hidden spoil.\r\nOccasionally, the hut of a bushranger has been observed: one, curiously\r\nformed, was found by soldiers on the brow of Mount Wellington; and\r\nbefore the door, a salting apparatus. The servants of the Van Diemen's\r\nLand Company saw a hut at St. Patrick's Plains, beyond the Great Lake\r\n(1826). At a distance it resembled a gigantic fallen tree, and in its\r\ncentre and side were doors, from which the whole plain could be surveyed\r\nand surprise prevented.\r\n\r\nThe Governor denounced the miserable fear of personal danger--certainly\r\nmore natural in the bush than the council chamber. Doubtless many, equal\r\nto the bravery of an actual conflict, preferred to pay black mail to\r\nrobbers, rather than risk their sudden inroads and secret vengeance. Nor\r\nwas it at all certain that a marauder, when captured, would be detained:\r\nsome broke from their prisons; from Launceston, a band together, who\r\nrenewed their pillage with increasing diligence. Among others, they\r\nattacked the house of Mr. Harrison, and maintained a fire which riddled\r\nhis premises. These men attempted to fortify themselves by erecting\r\nstone fences on the peak of a hill at the Macquarie: there they were\r\nsurprised and taken. The insecurity of the prisons, and the mode of\r\ndisposing of respited offenders, made it not unlikely that an officious\r\nwitness would be called to a future account: thus an old man, who\r\nprosecuted a burglar, was visited by the culprit when he returned from\r\nMacquarie Harbour; violently beaten, robbed, and threatened with death.\r\n\r\nTo distinguish these men was no slight difficulty: they often pretended\r\nto be constables, and were in possession before the error was\r\ndiscovered. One, still more serious, sometimes happened: thus two\r\nconstables saw two armed men enter a hut, and approaching challenged\r\nthem; answer not being promptly given, they fired, and severely wounded\r\nboth the astonished policemen. Nor were the settlers exempt from such\r\nperils. The bushrangers, often well dressed and mounted, made every\r\ntraveller an object of suspicion: when riding over the Cross Marsh, Mr.\r\nHodgson was challenged by the military stationed there; his motions of\r\nrecognition they understood as defiance, and fired. To his remonstrances\r\nthey answered with insolence, and expressed a wish that the shot had\r\nproved fatal. On a prosecution the rash soldier was acquitted, no malice\r\nbeing presumed (1826); and the attack was deemed a contingency of\r\ncolonial life.\r\n\r\nAmong those whose crimes obtained them the greater notoriety, were\r\nBrady, M'Cabe, Jeffries, and Dunne: well mounted upon horses, and armed\r\nwith muskets, they scoured the colony: murder, pillage, and arson,\r\nrendered every homestead the scene of terror and dismay. Those settlers\r\nmost exposed, often abandoned the business of their farms: their\r\ndwellings were perforated with loop-holes, their men were posted as\r\nsentinels, and all the precautions adopted, necessary in a state of war.\r\nBut though not without supporters and accomplices, the bushrangers were\r\nin far greater danger of betrayal and capture than at a former period.\r\nThe settlers, much more numerous, and of a higher class, felt that the\r\nsuppression of the robbers, or the desertion of the colony, were the\r\nonly alternatives. Governor Arthur exerted all the powers of government\r\nagainst them. Thus the issue was not long doubtful, although the contest\r\ncost many lives.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1824, a party under James Crawford, appeared on the river, and\r\nhaving robbed the house of Mrs. Smith, they loaded her servants with\r\ntheir plunder, and drove them towards the establishment of Mr. Robert\r\nTaylor: meeting his son, they compelled him to bear part of the burden.\r\nThe family observed the party approach, and armed to meet them. Young\r\nTaylor called to his father not to fire; and when he came near his\r\nfriends, he managed to escape from the robbers: a general skirmish\r\nensued. The young man seeing a piece levelled at his father, seized the\r\nassassin by the throat, and pulled him down: this brought a comrade to\r\nthe robber's assistance: one of the servants became alarmed for young\r\nTaylor, and fired; unhappily, the shot was fatal to the youth for whose\r\nprotection it was intended. The robbers now made their escape, leaving\r\nbehind, beside two of their companions, their arms and plunder. Governor\r\nArthur addressed a letter of condolence and praise to the sorrowing\r\nfamily: their neighbours expressed admiration of their courage, and\r\npresented a piece of plate to them, in testimony of their sympathy and\r\nesteem. Their example was exhibited by the Governor to the imitation of\r\nthe colonists, notwithstanding its terrible issue.\r\n\r\nThe overseer of Mr. Kemp was met by Brady and his party, and taken to\r\nhis master's house; there he was ordered to gain admission, which he did\r\nby answering the challenge of his employer: the bushrangers having\r\npossession, robbed the house, in the presence of seven assigned servants\r\nand two free persons. Yet it was not a small risk to begin the _melee_;\r\nand it was not reasonable to expect men, in their civil condition, to\r\nhazard life to protect the property of a master, for whom, perhaps, they\r\ndid not entertain much love. Thus the settlers could not always depend\r\nupon their men: many of whom saw, with pleasure, the vengeance inflicted\r\non masters who had sometimes procured their punishment; and, partly by\r\nsympathy and partly by fear, they were deterred from rendering effectual\r\nassistance. Three men, with blackened faces, visited the residence of\r\nCaptain Allison at Sandy Bay: he met them with uncommon courage, but\r\nwas struck down and beaten; he appealed to his servants, who only\r\nmuttered a reply to his calls for aid. Mrs. Allison joined her\r\nentreaties, when at length an atrocious woman (Hannah Bell, afterwards\r\nnotorious) said to the robbers, in a tone of sarcasm,--\"Come men, don't\r\nkill him quite out.\"\r\n\r\nOne of their most daring exploits was the taking of the town of Sorell,\r\nand the capture of the gaol. They entered the premises of Mr. Bethune,\r\nof which they kept possession until dusk on the following evening. Two\r\ngentlemen, who arrived there during the day, they detained: they\r\nstripped them of their clothing, and tendered the prisoner dress in\r\nexchange; this being, however, declined, one of the gentlemen wore no\r\nother covering than a blanket. These, and others, eighteen in number,\r\nthey compelled to accompany them to Sorell. A party of soldiers, who had\r\nbeen employed in pursuit all the day, and who were worn out with\r\nfatigue, while cleaning their guns, were surprised in the gaol. Brady\r\nlocked them up in a cell, and offered liberty to the prisoners he found\r\nthere; one of whom, who was charged with a capital offence, for which he\r\nwas afterwards executed, declined the opportunity to escape. The gaoler\r\nhastened to inform Lieutenant Gunn, who was in the neighbourhood, and\r\nthus prepared for the arrival of the robbers: while raising his arm, he\r\nreceived a shot above the elbow, which rendered amputation necessary.\r\nThis officer had been employed in the pursuit of the marauders for a\r\nconsiderable time, and his gigantic stature, courage, and energy,\r\nrendered his name formidable: he received from the public a valuable\r\npresent, and a pension from the colonial fund.\r\n\r\nThe roads were infested, and communication was dangerous: travellers\r\nwere arrested and tied to trees; and sometimes, though not frequently,\r\ntreated with cruelty. To preserve their property, the settlers resorted\r\nto concealment and stratagem: among the rest, the contrivance and\r\ncoolness of an old woman, merits remembrance, who knowing that the\r\nrobbers were on the road provided a paper of blank notes, which she\r\ndelivered to them, and thus saved a considerable sum, the result of her\r\nmarketing.\r\n\r\nTheir close pursuit at length filled them with a spirit of mischief, and\r\nthey perpetrated various acts of cruelty and wanton devastation. Among\r\ntheir most ordinary pleasantries, was forcing the people of an\r\nestablishment to drink to drunkenness: thus their recollection became\r\nconfused; they could not follow, and the robbers enjoyed the scene of\r\ntheir helpless intoxication. They held a pistol to a servant of Mr.\r\nHance, of the river Plenty, and compelled him to drink a large quantity\r\nof rum: they then led him off the farm and left him. He was discovered\r\nsome time after by a shepherd, his dog fondly licking his face: when\r\nraised up, he called for water, and died. Inflammation caused\r\nmortification of the intestines;--the tender mercies of the wicked are\r\ncruel! Not content with pillage, they destroyed the wool of three years'\r\nclip, the corn stacks, and the barns on the establishment of Mr.\r\nLawrence, by fire. Several other settlers experienced similar\r\nvisitations. The Governor issued a proclamation, five hundred copies of\r\nwhich were scattered through the colony. He threatened with death all\r\npersons who might afford them countenance. He offered rewards to a large\r\namount: for every bushranger mentioned in the notice one hundred\r\nguineas, or three hundred acres of land; or to prisoners, money and a\r\nfree pardon, whether directly or indirectly engaged in the capture; and\r\nto the chief constable in whose district the robber should be taken, one\r\nhundred acres. He complained that sufficient energy and co-operation had\r\nnot been employed, and called upon the magistrates and other persons to\r\ncombine for the liberation of the country. He himself resolved to fix\r\nhis residence at Jericho, to direct the operations; and the inhabitants\r\nof Hobart Town formed themselves into a guard, that thus the soldiers\r\nand constabulary might be wholly employed in this important service. The\r\nrobbers, however, being mounted, were enabled to move with considerable\r\nrapidity, and carried on their depredations in every part of the island.\r\n\r\nBy acts of wantonness and vengeful barbarity, they intended to\r\nintimidate the prisoners. They called Thomas Preston from his hut, on\r\nthe South Esk, and deliberately shot him. They took Captains White and\r\nSmith prisoners: the last, they made to kneel--their usual preparation\r\nfor murder; but were induced to spare his life, by the intercession of\r\nhis companion, who appealed to their humanity on behalf of his wife and\r\nchildren! They endeavoured to capture the _Glory_, belonging to one of\r\nthese gentlemen; but finding the wind unfavorable, they relinquished\r\nthat purpose. While Brady was on a hill, watching that vessel, a\r\nconfederate escaped, intending to betray them to Colonel Balfour: one of\r\nthe party, stationed as sentinel, was tried by a sort of court martial,\r\nfor permitting his elopement; he was shot, and flung into the Tamar.\r\nThey sent word that they would visit Launceston gaol, carry off\r\nJeffries, and put him to death. Their message was of course treated\r\nwith contempt, but they landed and advanced to the residence of Mr.\r\nDry, who was then entertaining a number of his friends. The banditti\r\nplundered the house, and were packing up their booty when Colonel\r\nBalfour, to whom a messenger had been dispatched, arrived with ten\r\nsoldiers and surrounded the house: the robbers retreated to the back\r\npart of the premises, and fired into the rooms. It was dark, and when\r\nthe firing ceased, they were supposed to have retreated. The colonel,\r\nwith four of his men, hastened to protect the town, to which a division\r\nof the robbers had been sent by Brady. As soon as he departed, some of\r\nthe party again showed themselves: Dr. Priest joined Mr. Theodore\r\nBartley, and the remaining soldiers; unfortunately, his clothing being\r\npartly white, enabled the robbers to take aim. His horse was shot dead:\r\nhe himself received a musket ball, which wounded him above his knee; and\r\nrefusing to submit to amputation he lost his life.\r\n\r\nExasperated by these crimes, the whole country rose against them: they\r\nwere sought in every quarter. The settlers, and soldiers scattered over\r\nthe colony, at the first notice of their appearance, were prepared to\r\nfollow them. The Governor himself took the field, and infused vigour\r\ninto the pursuit; and in less than a month the chief robbers were in the\r\nhands of justice. Brady, wounded in the leg, was overtaken by the\r\nsoldiers, and surrendered without a struggle. With Jeffries, he was\r\nconveyed to Hobart Town. A large crowd assembled to see robbers, who\r\nwere admired for their boldness by many, as much as they were detested\r\nfor their crimes.\r\n\r\nThe most ferocious of the bushrangers was Jeffries: he obtained his\r\nreprieve in Scotland, to act as executioner.[170] Being transported to\r\nthis country, he was employed as a scourger, and thus trained to\r\ncruelty, entered the bush. He robbed the house of Tibbs, a small\r\nsettler, and after wounding, compelled him, with his wife, to proceed to\r\nthe forest. The woman carried her infant: Jeffries was disturbed by its\r\ncries; perhaps, fearful that the sound might conduct his pursuers. He\r\ntook the child from the arms of its mother and dashed out its brains\r\nagainst a tree! When captured, he was taken to Launceston, where the\r\npeople, exasperated by his unusual guilt, were scarcely restrained, from\r\nsummary vengeance, by the presence of a strong guard. While in prison he\r\nmade sketches of his murders, and wrote memoirs of his life! His\r\ncountenance was an index of his character. Not so with Brady; who,\r\nthough guilty of heavy crimes, pretended to something like magnanimity:\r\nhe was drawn into the plan to escape, contrary to his own judgment, and\r\nthen said the _die_ was cast. His robberies were skilfully planned and\r\ndeliberately executed: he often restored such articles as the sufferers\r\nspecially valued. To every indictment he pleaded guilty: it was thought\r\nin contempt of justice; but certainly in the full conviction that it was\r\nuseless to expect either mercy or acquittal.\r\n\r\nAn instance of his persevering vengeance, which rests on the authority\r\nof a magistrate, may be worth remembering. A man, who had been a\r\nconfederate, determined to entrap him: Brady on approaching his hut felt\r\na presentiment of treachery; but at length was persuaded to advance. The\r\nconstables were in ambush: they fired, and both himself and his\r\ncompanion were arrested. Brady, wounded, was left bound in the hut with\r\nhis betrayer, while the constables conducted his comrade to a place of\r\nconfinement. He now requested to lie on the bed, and that a kangaroo rug\r\nmight be thrown over him: this done, he disentangled his arms and asked\r\nfor water. The guard laid aside his gun to procure it; this Brady\r\nseized, and in his turn became captor. While bound, he reproached the\r\nman for his perfidy, who said that he could but die; and that there was\r\nneither God nor devil! But being now in Brady's power, he fell upon his\r\nknees, and prayed him, for _God's sake_, to spare his life. Brady\r\nreminded him, that he had just said, \"there was no God;\" but added, that\r\nthe report of the gun might give warning of the state of affairs. He\r\nbade him beware of their next meeting, and departed. Afterwards, in\r\ncompany with his gang, he met this man, and holding a pistol to his\r\nhead, told him to say his prayers: the man, finding remonstrance\r\nuseless, coolly placed his head against the door of the hut, and said,\r\n\"fire!\" and was shot dead.\r\n\r\nPermission being given for prisoners to unite with the bushrangers, to\r\nbetray them, men in irons left the town secretly, joined the gang, and\r\ngave intelligence to the police. This manoeuvre was soon worn out. A\r\nprisoner, who escaped from gaol, desired to join them in good faith; but\r\nbelieving him a decoy, the gang adjudged him to suffer death. He was\r\ncompelled to drink a quantity of laudanum: they then left him; but his\r\nstomach rejected the drug, and after a sound sleep he recovered. He\r\nagain met Brady and his gang: two pistols were discharged at him: he\r\nfell, and was left for dead; but the wound was not mortal, and reviving\r\nhe determined to deliver himself up. He was, however, again unfortunate:\r\nhe met Brady and his companions once more, who again fired; but the\r\nbullet, instead of entering the skull, glanced round it. He fell\r\nsenseless to the ground, and was thrown into a dry creek; he, however,\r\nrecovered, and long survived these adventures.[171] The high authority\r\non which this anecdote rests, is quite necessary to suppress the\r\nquestion of its truth.\r\n\r\nDuring two years ending with 1826, one hundred and three persons\r\nsuffered death, being 3 8-15ths in proportion to one thousand of the\r\npopulation: more than in Great Britain. He who looks at these statistics\r\nalone, will conclude not only that the people were wicked, but that the\r\ngovernment was cruel. At one sitting of the court thirty-seven persons\r\nwere sentenced to death; and of these, twenty-three were executed in the\r\ncourse of a fortnight: nine suffering together, and fourteen others on\r\ntwo days closely following. A sacrifice of life so unusual, could only\r\nbe justified by the peculiar circumstances of the colony, and the\r\ncharacter of the criminals; and the notions which then prevailed\r\nrespecting the punishment of death.\r\n\r\nWe are forcibly reminded of a passage in Lord Coke:--\"If a man could see\r\nall the _Christians_, that in one year come to that untimely and\r\nignominious death--if there were any spark or grain of charity in him,\r\nit would make his heart bleed!\" The extreme pains taken to reconcile the\r\nunfortunate beings to their lot; the assiduity of the clergy to make up,\r\nby the assurance of divine mercy, the inexorable fate which awaited\r\nthem; proved that these awful slaughters were onerous to the colonial\r\nconscience, and vindicable only as the last resort of the last\r\nnecessity. The Governor must be acquitted of great blame. A discussion,\r\nof considerable warmth, arose (1825-6) on an address being presented\r\nfrom fifty persons, who complained of the delays of justice on\r\nbushrangers already condemned. The gaol was crowded, and the prisoners\r\nseemed not unlikely to escape: several did actually break out of prison.\r\nThis memorial was transmitted by the government to the chief justice,\r\nwho, while he disdained giving reasons to the colony, vindicated his\r\ncourt: the magistrates neglected the depositions; the attorney-general\r\nthe indictments, and the jury their summons. He had sat in a silent\r\ncourt until ashamed, while prisoners awaited deliverance. He had often\r\nfelt disposed to discharge them; some of whom were detained longer for\r\ntrial than for punishment. He could not perceive how the delay of\r\nexecution could facilitate the evasion of capture by those at large. In\r\ntransmitting this reply, Arthur took occasion to refer to the colonial\r\npress, supported by several of the memorialists, as largely implicated\r\nwith the crimes of the bushrangers. He traced, with some artifice, the\r\nviolence of the robbers to political dissensions, as inspiriting men who\r\neasily confounded \"the liberty of writing and the liberty of acting.\" To\r\nbe satisfied that the Governor did not seize an occasion of rebuke,\r\nrather than account for a public misfortune, is difficult; and not less,\r\nto sympathise with the petitioners. It is common for private individuals\r\nto deprecate the severities of public justice, but the awful state of\r\nthe colony must be admitted, when fifty persons, among its most opulent\r\nand even humane inhabitants, were anxious to hasten the offices of the\r\nexecutioner.\r\n\r\nThe ignorant and brutal among the prisoners rushed into violence and\r\ncrime, with a recklessness of life scarcely credible. Not less than one\r\nhundred were in arms at that time:[172] most of them were absconders\r\nfrom the various penal stations, and had exhausted all those forms of\r\nseverity which stopped short of the scaffold. Of seventy-three sentenced\r\ntogether, nine were for sheep-stealing, four for forgery, five for\r\nmurder, and twelve for robbery; besides four for the offence known in\r\ngaols under the name of blanketing, who were ordered for execution--a\r\npunishment which was commuted, being even then thought too severe for a\r\ntheft committed in gaol. They threw over the man whom they robbed a\r\nblanket, and raised loud outcries; and in this form effected their\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nA few of the cases tried on this occasion, will better illustrate the\r\ncondition of the colony than any general description. The murderers of\r\nAlexander Simpson, a settler at Pittwater, pillaged his shop, where he\r\nwas accustomed to sleep for the protection of his property: his body was\r\nfound in the river, decapitated, and his flesh torn from his bones; in\r\nmany places literally bare. On closer examination, the mark of a cord\r\nwas observed round his neck, which probably occasioned his death. The\r\nmangling of his body was intended to destroy the proof of identity: no\r\nmarks or signs of struggling were visible, nor was the head discovered.\r\nOne of the murderers dropped an expression, from which guilt was\r\ninferred. Suspicion was directed to several of the neighbours: articles,\r\nsuch as the deceased possessed, were found in their dwelling, _wet_;\r\nothers were discovered in a house adjoining the deceased's, _also wet_;\r\nthe accused were seen together, on the night of the murder. Twenty-two\r\nwitnesses gave evidence to facts, all of a circumstantial nature; but\r\nsufficient to secure a verdict against them. This crime was considered\r\nbut a type of many, committed in a neighbourhood, the traditions of\r\nwhich furnish many a tale of blood.\r\n\r\nAmong those who suffered death, were several whose captors acquired\r\nconsiderable reputation for their courage. Three were taken by Lucas,\r\nthe pilot, assisted by a man and a boy, to whom they surrendered with\r\narms in their hands: they had just before committed a robbery at the\r\nhouse of Mr. Holdship. On his defence, one of their number told the\r\njudge, that whatever might be law, he himself could not consider that to\r\nhold a pistol at the head was to offer violence! Several others belonged\r\nto a party which had escaped from Maria Island, a new penal settlement.\r\nOn their landing, they advanced to the house of Mr. Gatenby, and were\r\nseen approaching by his son, who took up his gun and went out to meet\r\nthem: he called upon their leader to lay down his arms, which he\r\nanswered by a discharge. Mr. Gatenby returned the shot, which proved\r\nmortal. The companions of the robber endeavoured to carry him off; but\r\nfinding this useless, they retreated, and re-appeared at the premises of\r\nMr. James Robertson, on the South Esk, whose lands, and those of his\r\nassigned servants, they tied, excepting one who was lame. Mr. W. Gray\r\ncoming up on horseback, they made prisoner, and bound him in a similar\r\nmanner. The leader of the robbers mounted his horse, while the rest\r\nguarded the gentlemen and servants, and marched them on towards the\r\nriver. Mr. Gray disengaged his arm, and by a signal seized one\r\nbushranger, while the lame man assailed another. Mr. Robertson also\r\nreleased himself, and got possession of the guns. The robbers were\r\noverpowered: one only escaped, but was captured the following day.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was not slow to acknowledge these instances of gallantry.\r\nThe courage of the masters, and the fidelity of their men, were held up\r\nto the colony as brilliant examples, and to the robbers as a proof that\r\npersons of the same civil condition had no sympathy with their crimes;\r\nthat their career would be short, and their capture certain.\r\nTickets-of-leave were granted to the men, with a promise of full\r\nfreedom, as a reward of one year's service in the field police. The\r\n_Government Gazette_ observed, that such presence of mind and personal\r\nbravery, in another age would have entitled the captors to armorial\r\nbearings; they, however, received donations of land, perhaps not less\r\nvaluable in this meridian.\r\n\r\nAmongst others who received a reprieve, was William Kerr, convicted of\r\nforging, in the name of the chief justice, an ingenious device, which,\r\nif it did not preserve him from conviction, perhaps rescued him from a\r\nseverer fate. He was advanced in years, and said to be a near relative\r\nof the Earl of Roxborough, and a brother to Lord Kerr. In gaol, he was\r\nconspicuous for his zeal in attempting the instruction of his fellow\r\nprisoners, performing the office of chaplain in the absence of a better!\r\nThese unfortunate beings were placed together in cells, too narrow to\r\nallow retirement or freedom from interruption: their attempts at escape,\r\nonce or twice nearly successful, rendered it necessary to load them with\r\nirons. The time of execution was fixed, ere they wholly despaired of\r\nliberty. There was not, however, deficiency of clerical attention: Mr.\r\nCorvosso, the wesleyan minister, joined with Messrs. Bedford and\r\nKnopwood, in this awful task.\r\n\r\nLarge crowds assembled to witness the first execution; but when the\r\nnovelty was over, the interest subsided. The last assembly was more\r\nselect: in the description given by Dr. Ross, we seem rather to read of\r\na martyrdom than an expiation. They came forth, he observed, with\r\ncountenances unappalled: the light of truth rendered that ignominious\r\nmorning the happiest of their lives. They prayed in succession, in a\r\ndevout and collected manner: one in particular, with a countenance\r\nserene and placid, expressing his thanks to the chief justice for his\r\nimpartial trial; and to the Governor for rejecting his petition for\r\nlife. In this tranquil frame they submitted to the executioner. The\r\nspectators were affected to tears: the officers and clergymen,\r\noverpowered, hurried from the scene: the criminals died, as they were\r\nsinging--\r\n\r\n    \"The hour of my departure's come,\r\n    I hear the voice that calls me home;\r\n    Oh, now my God, let troubles cease,\r\n    And let thy servant die in peace.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time Dunne, the bushranger, was executed: he attained a\r\nconsiderable distinction by his crimes; more, by his protracted evasion\r\nof pursuit, and his sanguinary resistance of capture; and still more, by\r\nthe ceremonies of his execution and the honors of his funeral. He came\r\nforth to the scaffold, arrayed in a robe of white, adorned, both before\r\nand behind, with a large black cross. He wore a cap with a similar\r\ntoken, and carried a rosary in his hand. He was presented with a coffin\r\nof cedar, ornamented with the devices of innocence and sorrow; and\r\nbearing a plate, which told his name and the time of his death! As he\r\nadvanced, with several youthful fellow sufferers (of whom it is only\r\nsaid, that they seemed _much terrified_), he continued to exclaim,\r\nsmiting his breast with theatrical expression of grief--\"O, Lord,\r\ndeliver us!\" He was followed by forty couples to the grave. Such were\r\nthe honors paid to a murderer. It is not astonishing, that witnesses\r\nwere insulted, and had to appeal for protection. A proposition was made\r\nby the government newspaper, to render penal the taunts which prisoners\r\nwere accustomed to use against such as assisted in the suppression of\r\noutrage.\r\n\r\nThe public effect of these exhibitions will be extremely questionable by\r\nsober-minded and pious men. To see a criminal depart from this life in a\r\nhardened and contemptuous spirit is, indeed, appalling; but the\r\nserenity, and even rapture, thus common when terminating a career of\r\nguilt and cruelty, often entered into the calculation of transgressors.\r\nAmong the miserable forms of vanity, is the triumph of boasting\r\npenitence; and even when nothing else remains, the _eclat_ of a public\r\nexecution. Some were anxious to commit to writing their own last\r\nconfessions of guilt, to secure a posthumous interest in the terror or\r\npity of mankind.[173] The fullest appreciation of that system of mercy,\r\nwhich never separates religious hope from the living, would scarcely\r\njustify confidence, founded on such demeanour and language between the\r\ncell and the scaffold.\r\n\r\nScarcely had this scene closed, when the prisoners in the penitentiary,\r\nallured by the prospect of escape, broke through the gaol, and seized a\r\nboat: as they approached the _Emma Kemp_, a premature display of muskets\r\nconvinced them that their plan was discovered. It was, indeed, known by\r\nthe officers of the gaol prior to their departure; who, calculating on\r\ntheir arrest, permitted the consummation of their plans. This cost them\r\ntheir lives: they retreated to the shore, robbed Mr. Mortimer of eight\r\nstand of arms, and commenced their career as bushrangers. They were\r\nevidently unwilling adventurers, and soon taken. The Governor, at their\r\nexecution, compelled the attendance of the prisoners, in the fallacious\r\nbelief that the sight would prove admonitory as well as terrible.\r\n\r\nSeveral were mere youths: their obituary, furnished by the indefatigable\r\nchronicler of executions, Dr. Ross, is not without interest. There was\r\nDunhill, six feet three inches high and handsome, a frequent attendant\r\nat criminal courts; whose father was a prisoner for life, and whose\r\nfamily, once the terror of Yorkshire, were mostly transported or\r\nexecuted. There was Child, the son of a Bristol merchant, who, as the\r\nrope was adjusting, said, \"I know I shall go to heaven!\" There was a\r\nScotch boy, who sang as he went; but said he was ruined in the\r\npenitentiary. Another had driven his mother to self destruction.\r\n\r\nNine men were executed towards the close of the following year, for the\r\nmurder of a constable, named George Rex, at Macquarie Harbour: their\r\nleader, James Lacy, a person of considerable talent, was saved on a\r\nformer occasion by the mediation of the Rev. W. Bedford, who represented\r\nthat to Lacy's influence a settler owed his life. Having planned an\r\nescape, they seized the constable; and having bound and gagged some\r\nfellow prisoners, whom they rejected as accomplices, they took Rex and\r\npushed him into the water, and held down his head until life was\r\nextinct. They then formed a raft, but it was insufficient to convey\r\nthem: three only landed on the main, and were pursued and retaken. The\r\nsole witnesses summoned against them were prisoners, who prevaricated in\r\ntheir testimony; but the presence of surgeon Barnes supplied the\r\nevidence they thought proper to conceal, and insured the conviction. At\r\nthe close of the trial, Lacy leaned over the bar and said, \"had it not\r\nbeen for you, doctor, we should have pulled through.\"\r\n\r\nLacy was conspicuous in the press-yard for his fervour, and delivered an\r\nanimated warning to the multitude, who were drawn together to witness an\r\nunusual sacrifice of life at one drop! Dr. Ross, who still endeavoured\r\nto rally round the scaffold some special interest, gave an artistic\r\ndescription of their end; but he was astonished to observe how the\r\nsufferers themselves were but little affected, and the spectators less.\r\nHe mourned over the unmeaning countenances of the mob, who felt little\r\nbut curiosity when they saw them step from the full bloom of life to the\r\ngrave! Nor was it perceived by that zealous defender of lenity, when the\r\ngovernment was lenient, and of the severity, when the government was\r\nsevere, that the execution of nine persons for an act, in which three\r\nonly actually participated, or perhaps contemplated, could only be\r\npossible among such a people. It is rather a matter of exultation, that\r\nthere is a limit, beyond which executions become the dullest of all\r\nentertainments. At that time no one would have thought a single sufferer\r\nworth a glance of the eye.\r\n\r\nIt is remarked, that the most notorious of these offenders were rather\r\nprepossessing, except that their looks, by long residence in the bush,\r\nhad acquired an air of wildness. The indicative theories of Lavater were\r\nnegatived by the usual aspect of these crowds of victims; but the most\r\nimpatient of penal restraint, have been not only violent and corrupt,\r\nbut often of resolute and generous dispositions; often possessing the\r\nelements of a mental character, which, had it not been perverted by\r\ncrime, might have been distinguished for the energy of virtue. On the\r\nprimary treatment of such men, everything depends; and their first\r\nmaster determined whether they were to become active and intelligent\r\nagriculturists, or by pernicious indulgence, and not less ill-judged\r\nseverity, to pass rapidly, by a reckless and resentful temper, from the\r\ntriangle to the scaffold.\r\n\r\nSuch severe exhibitions of penal vengeance were intended to crush the\r\ninsurgent spirit; to prove to the prisoners that any forms of\r\ncombination or resistance would be followed by severer suffering. The\r\nre-action of that excitement assisted the future success of discipline.\r\nIt convinced the masters that a neglected or careless management was\r\nequally pernicious. But the natives, also became objects of terror: the\r\noutlaw could not wander far without risk from their spears, or hover\r\nnear the settled districts without encountering the roving parties\r\nemployed in their pursuit. Thus the ravages of white men almost wholly\r\nceased, during the conflict with the aboriginal tribes: the constables\r\nand the blacks together beat up the quarters of absconders.\r\n\r\nBut the precautions of the government were more effectual than its\r\nseverity. Hitherto many had lived at large. At night their own masters;\r\nwhen not seduced by more serious temptations, their drunkenness exposed\r\nthem to the lash; and dread or resentment precipitated them into open\r\ncrime. In 1827, the enlargement of the penitentiary, and its better\r\norder, enabled the government to recall from private dwellings those\r\nleast worthy of trust; and to make the indulgence of a home a reward for\r\norderly and industrious habits. The prisoners employed by the crown were\r\ndivided into seven classes. Some were permitted to labor one day weekly\r\nfor their own advantage: these were the mechanics, who were detained\r\nonly because they were artisans; others, on the roads, were allowed half\r\nthat time, and by great exertions often obtained very considerable sums.\r\nThe rest were in irons, or sent to the penal settlement under a\r\nmagisterial sentence.\r\n\r\nThe fate of many who had suffered death was traced by the Governor to\r\nthe imprudence and guilty connivance of the masters, or to the irregular\r\nmethods of payment long interdicted by the crown; such as cattle,\r\nallotments, or a portion of time. The executive council professed to\r\nfollow up these evils through every stage of their growth, until they\r\nwere finally consummated on the scaffold.[174] During twenty years they\r\nhad been often condemned; but they were not extinguished until the\r\nmarket was enlarged, and labor became scarce--so much do moral questions\r\ndepend on material revolutions.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of servants was made with more prudence, and some\r\nreference to their previous habits and mode of life; and a stand was\r\nopposed to the sole superintendence of prisoner overseers, who were\r\noften the occasion of unjust punishments and criminal laxity. The\r\nimpounding laws gradually cut off another occasion of mischief.\r\nHeretofore, large herds of cattle were under the charge of prisoner\r\nherdsmen, who were armed with guns. The wild and exciting employment\r\nexposed the men to many temptations: their daring spirit and fearless\r\nriding, rendered them objects of admiration; and created discontent in\r\nthe minds of prisoners who were tied down to the more quiet labor of a\r\nfarm. Of eight men employed by Mr. Lord, a wealthy colonist, five\r\nsuffered death for various crimes.[175] Such persons lived remote from\r\nthe civilised community and the inspection of their employers: often\r\nthe channel of communication between the town receivers and country\r\nthieves; nor this alone. The large herds wandering far beyond the limits\r\nof the settled country, and without a recognised owner, suggested to the\r\ndiscontented servant a resource, and led him to abscond where he could\r\nsubsist on the flesh of slaughtered spoil.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: From Barnes' and Lempriere's account: compared, they\r\ndiffer in statistics; but Barnes copied his statements from the official\r\nrecords at the Harbour.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: _Par. Pap._\r\n\r\nOf 182 prisoners, 169 were sentenced in 1822 to 7,000 lashes; that is,\r\nall were punished, except 13: and received each, upon an average, 400\r\nlashes--inflicted with the severity unknown elsewhere.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: It has been suggested to the author, since the above was\r\nin type, that the disclosures of this unfortunate being are not without\r\na moral, which may compensate for the disgust their perusal may\r\noccasion. They are therefore given in a note, which the reader may pass\r\nover:--\r\n\r\n\"The Rev. Mr. Connoly, who attended this unfortunate man, administering\r\nto him the consolations of religion, addressed the crowd assembled\r\naround the scaffold, a few minutes before the fatal drop was let to\r\nfall, in words to the following effect: He commenced by stating that\r\nPearce, standing on the awful entrance into eternity on which he was\r\nplaced, was desirous to make the most public acknowledgment of his\r\nguilt, in order to humble himself, as much as possible, in the sight of\r\nGod and man; that to prevent any embarrassment which might attend Pearce\r\nin personally expressing himself, he had requested and directed him to\r\nsay, that he committed the murder of Cox, under the following\r\ncircumstances:--Having been arrested here, after his escape from\r\nMacquarie Harbour, Pearce was sent back to that settlement, where the\r\ndeceased (Cox) and he were worked together in the same gang. Cox\r\nconstantly entreated him to run away with him from that settlement,\r\nwhich he refused to do for a length of time. Cox having procured\r\nfishhooks, a knife, and some burnt rag for tinder, he at last agreed to\r\ngo with him, to which he was powerfully induced by the apprehension of\r\ncorporal punishment, for the loss of a shirt that had been stolen from\r\nhim. For the first and second day they strayed through the forest; on\r\nthe third made the beach, and travelled towards Port Dalrymple, until\r\nthe fifth, when they arrived at King's River. They remained three or\r\nfour days in an adjoining wood, to avoid soldiers who were in pursuit of\r\nthem, and were all the time, from the period they started, without a\r\nmorsel to eat. Overcome by famine, Pearce determined to take Cox's life,\r\nwhich he effected by the stroke of an axe while Cox was sleeping. Soon\r\nafter the soldiers had departed, Pearce occupied the place they had been\r\nin, where he remained part of a day and a night, living on the mutilated\r\nremains of Cox; he returned to the settlement, made signal, and was\r\ntaken up by the pilot, who conveyed him to Macquarie Harbour, where he\r\ndisclosed to the commandant the deed he had done, being weary of life,\r\nand willing to die for the misfortunes and atrocities into which he had\r\nfallen.\r\n\r\nThe reverend gentlemen then proceeded to state, that he believed it was\r\nin the recollection of every one present, that eight men had made their\r\nescape, last year, from Macquarie Harbour. All these, except Pearce, who\r\nwas of the party, soon perished, or were destroyed by the hands of their\r\ncompanions. To set the public right respecting their fate, Pearce is\r\ndesirous to state that this party, which consisted of himself, Matthew\r\nTravers, Bob Greenhill, Bill Cornelius, Alexander Dalton, John Mathers,\r\nand two more, named Bodnam and Brown, escaped from Macquarie Harbour in\r\ntwo boats, taking with them what provision the coal-miners had, which\r\nafforded each man about two ounces of food per day, for a week.\r\nAfterwards they lived eight or nine days on the tops of tea tree and\r\npeppermint, which they boiled in tin-pots to extract the juice. Having\r\nascended a hill, in sight of Macquarie Harbour, they struck a light and\r\nmade two fires. Cornelius, Brown, and Dalton, placed themselves at one\r\nfire, the rest of the party at the other; those three separated,\r\nprivately, from the party, on account of Greenhill having already said,\r\nthat lots must be cast for some one to be put to death, to save the\r\nwhole from perishing. Pearce does not know, personally, what became of\r\nCornelius, Brown, and Dalton: he heard that Cornelius and Brown reached\r\nMacquarie Harbour, where they soon died, and that Dalton perished on his\r\nreturn to that settlement. After their departure, the party, then\r\nconsisting of five men, lived two or three days on wild berries and\r\ntheir kangaroo jackets, which they roasted; at length they arrived at\r\nGordon's River, where it was agreed, that while Mathers and Pearce\r\ncollected fire-wood, Greenhill and Travers should kill Bodnam, which they\r\ndid. It was insisted upon, that every one should partake of Bodnam's\r\nremains, lest, in the event of their ultimate success to obtain their\r\nliberty, any of them might consider himself innocent of his death, and\r\ngive evidence against the rest. After a day or two, they all swam across\r\nthe river, except Travers, whom they dragged across by means of a pole,\r\nto which he tied himself. Having spent some days in distress and famine,\r\nit was proposed to Pearce, by Greenhill and Travers, that Mathers be\r\nkilled, to which he agreed. Travers and Pearce held him, while Greenhill\r\nkilled him with an axe. Living on the remains of the deceased, which\r\nthey were hardly able to taste, they spent three or four days, through\r\nweakness, without advancing beyond five of six miles; Travers being\r\nscarcely able to move from lameness and swelling in his foot. Greenhill\r\nand Pearce agreed to kill Travers, which Greenhill did while Pearce\r\ncollected fire-wood. Having lived some time on the remains of Travers,\r\nthey were for some days without any thing to eat; their wants were\r\ndreadful: each strove to catch the other off his guard, and kill him.\r\nPearce succeeded to find Greenhill asleep; took his life--and lived upon\r\nhim for four days. He was afterwards for three days without any\r\nsustenance; fell in, at last with the Derwent River, and found some\r\nsmall pieces of opossum, &c., at a place where the natives had lately\r\nmade fires. More desirous to die than to live, he called out as loudly\r\nas he could, expecting the natives would hear him, and come to put an\r\nend to his existence! Having fallen in with some bushrangers, with whom\r\nhe was taken, Pearce was sent back to Macquarie Harbour, from whence he\r\nescaped with Cox, as has been already stated, for whose death he is now\r\nabout to suffer.\"--_Hobart Town Gazette_, 1824.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: _Ross's Almanack._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: \"The fact was also corroborated by Brady, when examined\r\nby the gentleman from whom I got the account; and, strange as it may\r\nappear, it is perfectly correct.\"--_Breton's New South Wales_, p. 340.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: _Gazette_, 1825.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: The author is assured by a clergyman, that he has been\r\ndismissed his attendance upon a prisoner, within a few days of his\r\nexecution, for refusing to write down the particulars of his life.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: \"The flagitious proceedings of several of these men were\r\nclearly traced to have had their source in the weakness or improper\r\ntreatment of their employers, whose ill-judged neglect of discipline, or\r\ncorrupt toleration of irregularity, had contributed to entail\r\nconsequences so awful to those victims to offended justice.

The\r\nshort but severe government (1824) of Lieutenant Wright was superseded\r\nby Captain Butler (1825), of whom the common testimony is favorable. Its\r\neconomical results will be comprehended in that general view of prison\r\nlabor, reserved for the close of this volume. He extended cultivation,\r\nand thus mitigated the sufferings of the prisoners; and by building\r\nships, varied the industry of the men--many of whom went down for\r\npunishment, but returned skilful mechanics.\r\n\r\nOf all the thousands professing to bring back its consolation to the\r\nwretched, not one minister had been found--perhaps not sought for--to\r\ntry there the remedies of the gospel. That a Wesleyan missionary\r\nventured, entitles him to the esteem of mankind. Governor Arthur\r\nsuggested, and even entreated this direction of missionary labours: he\r\nwrote to Joseph Butterworth, M.P., and to the Colonial-office, and the\r\nRev. Mr. Schofield was appointed to enter this moral desert. On his\r\narrival in 1829, he heard terrific accounts of the perils of that place:\r\nhe was told, that his labors would be useless, and his life sacrificed.\r\nHe hesitated for a time; but Arthur declared that such a post of danger,\r\nhe, as a soldier, should consider one of honor.\r\n\r\nMr. Schofield proved that he was neither deficient in zeal nor prudence.\r\nThe place prepared for his ministry was, indeed, comfortless: the wind\r\noverpowered his voice, and his congregation shivered with cold; but to\r\nthe men it was a new era. Having discoursed on the advantages of\r\nknowledge, forty-seven prisoners requested instruction; and, assisted by\r\nMr. Commissary Lempriere, and countenanced by the commandant, he taught\r\nmany to read. Capt. Butler marked a change in the temper of the men:\r\npunishments fell off one half; several were united with the wesleyan\r\nsociety; and on the missionary's recommendation, their stay was\r\nshortened.\r\n\r\nThey only should ask the reality of such repentance, who have\r\nendeavoured to reform the wicked. One man was specially pointed out to\r\nMessrs. Backhouse and Walker: the change in his conduct was great, and\r\nits effects visible: his demeanour, his countenance, and, said the\r\ncommandant, \"his very voice was changed.\" He had lost his arm by an\r\naccident, which nearly deprived him of life. He had formed a cave at the\r\nbase of the island, reached by a steep slippery descent. It was here Mr.\r\nBackhouse joined him, as he knelt down on the rough floor of his cold\r\ncavern to adore the Almighty, for granting the privilege of solitude!\r\nStrange meeting, and strange subject of thanksgiving!\r\n\r\nMessrs. Backhouse and Walker, of the Society of Friends, travelled these\r\ncolonies (1831 to 1836), chiefly engaged in religious labors, and\r\nprincipally to admonish the prisoners. The volume, of which Backhouse\r\nwas the author, attests their industry and accurate observation, while\r\nperforming a mission, which the moral weight of their connections\r\nrendered of great moment. To understand this record of their labors,\r\nsome acquaintance with science is requisite, and not less a knowledge of\r\nquaker modes of thought. The adventurous and buoyant spirit of the\r\nwriter, which carried him into odd situations, is sometimes irresistibly\r\ndroll, in contrast with formal phrases. He was a gentleman of prudence\r\nand sagacity: \"he lifted up his heart to God; took his pocket compass,\"\r\nand thus escaped some perils, both by sea and land; and carried to\r\nEngland a reputation, from which detraction has taken nothing, and which\r\nfriendship would scarcely desire to improve.\r\n\r\nThe capture of the _Cyprus_ in Recherche Bay, on the voyage to Macquarie\r\nHabour, was a stirring episode in the history of transportation. It\r\nexcited vast interest in Great Britain, and was dramatised at a London\r\ntheatre. The prisoners, who wage war with society, regarded the event\r\nwith exultation; and long after, a song, composed by a sympathising\r\npoet, was propagated by oral tradition, and sung in chorus around the\r\nfires in the interior. This version of the story made the capture a\r\ntriumph of the oppressed over their oppressors. The stanzas set forth\r\nthe sufferings of the prisoners by the cruelty of their masters, who\r\nthey vainly attempted to please. It related their flight from torture\r\nto the woods, and drew but a dreary picture of the life of an outlaw. It\r\npassed through the details of conviction and embarkation, and then\r\ndescribed the dashing seamanship of the pirates in managing the bark,\r\nonce destined to carry them to that place of suffering; but which bore\r\n\"bold Captain Swallow\" to the wide ocean and liberty. Such was the song;\r\nbut the facts were different. In August, 1829, thirty-one prisoners\r\nembarked on board the _Cyprus_; among them was Swallow, a seaman, who\r\neighteen years before had cut out a schooner at Port Jackson, and was\r\nafterwards transported to Van Diemen's Land in the _Deveron_, Captain\r\nWilson.\r\n\r\nThis man, before he landed, exemplified remarkable courage. A dreadful\r\nstorm disabled the vessel; the rigging was in fragments: it became\r\nnecessary to cut away a portion of the wreck, which would probably cost\r\nthe adventurer his life. The captain called for a volunteer, and all\r\nbeing silent was himself about to ascend, when Swallow remarking that\r\nhis own life was of little moment, accomplished the perilous task.\r\nPerhaps presuming on this service, he was found secreted on board the\r\n_Deveron_ on its homeward voyage, and was delivered to the British\r\nadmiral at Rio; he, however escaped, got to London, was retaken and\r\nreturned to this colony. Several others were capital respites, who had\r\nbeen guilty of atrocious crimes.\r\n\r\nThese men were entrusted to the charge of Lieut. Carew, and a guard of\r\nten soldiers. On board they had provision for four hundred men for six\r\nmonths, with a scanty supply of water. When he received the prisoners,\r\nLieut. Carew was warned of their desperate character by the gaoler,\r\nthough not of the precise nature of their crimes. The ammunition\r\nsupplied was, however, insufficient--ten rounds each man: to spare the\r\npowder, the muskets were not often charged. The berths of the soldiers\r\nwere below, and the opening only sufficient to emerge unarmed: that of\r\nthe prisoners was too small to permit their lying down: one opening\r\nadmitted air, without bars or fastenings, and could not be closed day or\r\nnight. It was necessary to exercise on deck, and at the time of the\r\ncapture the number allowed was exceeded, it is said by the connivance of\r\nthe convict sailors. Several of the prisoners had before been relieved\r\nof their irons: among the rest, Swallow, the pirate captain; and when\r\nthe assault commenced, there were nine, and soon after sixteen engaged\r\nin the fray. There were only two sentinels, and one other soldier\r\nunarmed on deck. Lieut. Carew had left the vessel to fish, accompanied\r\nby the surgeon, the mate, a soldier, and the prisoner Popjoy. A few\r\nminutes after, he heard the firing of a musket, and hastened towards the\r\nvessel; but when he reached her side she was taken. The struggle with\r\nthe sentinels seems to have been severe; and one of the soldiers below\r\nfired a shot, which passed between the arm of Swallow and his side. The\r\nmutineers compelled them to surrender by pouring down water into the\r\nhold, and threatening to stifle them if resistance were prolonged: they\r\nwere also in danger of suffocation from their own gunpowder. Carew\r\nimplored the pirates to give up the vessel, and promised oblivion: when\r\nattempting to board, they pointed several muskets at his breast. At\r\nlength he consented to go ashore, with the soldiers and thirteen\r\nprisoners, who refused to share in the adventure; and, in all,\r\nforty-five were landed at different points of the bay. The pirates gave\r\nthem one sheep, a few pieces of beef, thirty pounds of flour, and half a\r\nbag of biscuit, with a small quantity of spirit and sugar; and at dawn\r\nsailed from the coast. The refusal of a boat, cut off all immediate\r\ncommunication with the port, and gave time for considerable progress.\r\nThe _Cyprus_ was without charts, but several of the mutineers were well\r\nacquainted with navigation.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of the party on shore were inexpressible: they\r\ndistributed one quarter of biscuit daily, and subsisted chiefly on\r\nmuscles, found for some time, until a spring-tide covered them. Morgan\r\nand Popjoy set out the next day for Hobart, and attempted to cross a\r\nriver, with their garments tied on their backs: they were driven back by\r\nthe natives, and were obliged to return, having lost their clothes. Five\r\nmen started to head the Huon, and thus reach Hobart; and were saved from\r\nstarvation, only by the party sent down to meet them. Morgan and Popjoy,\r\nunder the direction of Carew, and encouraged by his lady, who displayed\r\nextraordinary fortitude, constructed a coracle of wicker work, about\r\ntwelve feet long, formed of the wattle: they covered it with hammock\r\ncloth, and overlaid it with boiled soap and resin mingled, which they\r\nhappened to possess. In this frail bark they boldly ventured to sea;\r\nand, notwithstanding a strong south breeze, happily found the _Orelia_\r\nat Partridge Island, twenty miles distant. Contrary winds had compelled\r\nthat vessel to put back to the island, and boats were instantly\r\nforwarded to the relief of the sufferers, who for two days had been\r\nwithout sustenance. Though several had received severe contusions in\r\nthe capture, and experienced much privation during the thirteen days\r\ndetention, no life was lost.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances attending the capture were subject to the\r\ninvestigation of a court martial. Lieutenant Carew was charged with\r\nneglecting the proper precautions, though warned of the extreme peril\r\nwhich demanded his vigilance; that he proceeded on a fishing excursion;\r\nthat during his absence the vessel was surprised and seized; that he\r\nexhibited professional incapacity, and had been guilty of a breach of\r\nthe articles of war. This trial lasted five days, and was fully\r\nreported. The evidence is conflicting, and especially respecting those\r\nincidents which were supposed to suggest the capture to the prisoners:\r\nsuch as the neglect of the fire-arms, and the indulgence of the\r\nprisoners by a removal of their irons, and their access to the deck. On\r\nthe other hand, the testimony was positive and multiplied, that Carew\r\nhad guarded the prisoners with great steadiness and rigour. That he\r\napprehended no danger was certain--his wife and children were aboard;\r\nbut he forgot that the desire of liberty makes men quick and desperate,\r\nand that they who had the miseries of Macquarie Harbour before them,\r\nmade light of life.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements of the vessel did not, however, admit of proper\r\nprecautions. When two of these men, in company with sixteen other\r\nprisoners, were sent down three years after to the penal settlement,\r\nthere were ten soldiers to guard them: two only were on deck at once.\r\nTheir prison was railed in, and closed down with triple bolts: the\r\nsentinels were doubled, and some sat continually in sight of the\r\nprisoners.[176]\r\n\r\nThe pirates proceeded to the Friendly Islands, and thence to the Islands\r\nof the Japannese, where seven deserted, and the rest passed towards\r\nChina. Four seamen presented themselves in a boat, having _Edward_ on\r\nthe stern, to a vessel at Whampoa, and stated that they had belonged to\r\na lost ship of that name. Swallow was one of them: he was examined by\r\nthe committee of supercargoes at Canton, and produced a sextant on which\r\nwas the name of Waldron, of the _Edward_. This name Swallow assumed, and\r\nsaid that he was captain of the _Edward_, of Durham; related his voyages\r\nto various ports of South America, the Sandwich Islands, and Japan.\r\nCompelled to abandon his vessel, injured by the fire of the Japannese,\r\nthe crew had divided into parties, of which himself and companions were\r\none. This deposition was forwarded to the company's secretary, and\r\npassages were given free to Swallow and three others. A few days after\r\nhe had sailed, four more appeared: Davis, who gave his name as Stanley,\r\nwas examined; but he had forgotten the assumed name of the captain, and\r\ncalled him Wilson--this led to minuter inquiries, and he was sent home a\r\nprisoner. Information was instantly forwarded, and reached England\r\nbefore Swallow arrived with his companions, and a warrant was issued for\r\ntheir detention: the three were taken, but Swallow had left the ship at\r\nMargate, and for a time escaped.\r\n\r\nWatts, Davis, and Swallow, were ultimately tried for this offence by the\r\nAdmiralty Court, in London: the two first were executed, and Swallow was\r\nacquitted. It is said that the proof of his participation, except by\r\ncompulsion, was incomplete. The events which led to their conviction\r\nwere curiously coincident. The Thames police magistrate was unable to\r\nproceed, and they might have been discharged; but the police clerk had\r\nstudied the _Hue and Cry_, and was struck with their resemblance to the\r\ndescription. Popjoy, now in England,[177] pardoned for his good conduct\r\nat the capture, had been recently before the magistrate for some\r\ntrifling offence, and to interest his worship had given the story of the\r\ncapture, the coracle, and all incidents of his intrepidity. He was thus\r\nsoon found out by the police, and gave full proof of identity. He stated\r\ntheir crimes, their names, and secret marks which were discovered on\r\ntheir persons: one of them, the very day of the capture, had the figure\r\nof a mermaid punctured on his arm. Mr. Capon, the gaoler of Hobart Town,\r\nwas in London,[178] and thus was able to supply important particulars.\r\n\r\nSeveral were forwarded to Van Diemen's Land, and tried by Judge Pedder:\r\nthey pleaded that their concurrence was involuntary. The chief question\r\nwas the actual position of the vessel; whether or not on the high seas.\r\nThe military jury were not disposed to hesitate on this point, and when\r\nasked repeatedly, whether they found a place shut in between two heads\r\n_the high seas_, they answered, without hesitation, \"we do.\" Only John\r\nCam suffered death in Van Diemen's Land. Robert M'Guire was tried last\r\nfor this offence: in the scuffle, he wounded a soldier, who had\r\nattempted to strike him, and whose testimony was decisive: he stood\r\nsentry, with a military cross-belt and bayonet fixed; and was\r\nrecollected by his refusal of liquor, which he warned his comrades would\r\nprove their destruction.\r\n\r\nThe chief advantage of Macquarie Harbour was its total isolation; but\r\nthe opening of the country from the Derwent to the Gordon, destroyed\r\nthis seclusion. The bar gradually rising, became more dangerous: the\r\nplace was too distant for supervision or supply; its barren soil allowed\r\nno variety of labour or produce. The decaying buildings were of little\r\nworth: there was nothing removable, except the doors and windows. These\r\nwere shipped on board the _Frederick_, of one hundred tons; and all\r\nbeing ready for sea, on the 11th January, 1834, Mr. Taw, the pilot, as\r\ncaptain, embarked with the master shipwright, Mr. Hoy, the mate, ten\r\nprisoners of the crown, and a corporal's guard. They were detained by\r\nadverse winds, and the pilot allowed the prisoners to land to wash their\r\nclothing, all except one; they returned with great apparent\r\ncheerfulness. Two of the soldiers were permitted to fish near a\r\nneighbouring rock, and thus only two remained on board: while one of\r\nthese, allured into the forecastle, listened to the singing of a\r\nconvict, the prisoners on deck handed out the arms. Messrs. Hoy and Taw\r\nendeavoured to recover possession, both by persuasion and force: there\r\nwas a short scuffle, and shots were fired: the balls passed near the\r\ngentlemen in the cabin, though they were not injured. Remonstrance being\r\nuseless, they surrendered, and with the soldiers now recalled from the\r\nrock, were sent on shore: thus, although the military and civil officers\r\nwere nearly equal in number, the mutineers accomplished their purpose\r\nwithout loss of life. They sent next day a quantity of provisions, small\r\nin amount, but, considering the voyage before them, more than such men\r\ncould have been expected to spare. The soldiers, gratified by their\r\nfairness, forgot their own position in sympathy for the liberated men,\r\nand gave them cheers and good wishes. On the morning after, the wind\r\nbecame fair, and a light breeze carried them beyond danger.\r\n\r\nWhen the mutineers had gained possession of the ship, John Barker, a\r\nmariner, was chosen captain: he could take an observation, and direct a\r\nship's course; his mate was John Fair, and several others were sailors.\r\nBy carrying too much canvas they strained the vessel, which required\r\ntheir constant efforts at the pump. They proposed to run to Valdavia,\r\nSouth America: they suffered from a gale of wind of nine days duration,\r\nwhich they weathered with great difficulty, and saw land on the 26th of\r\nFebruary, having been six weeks on their passage. They resolved to\r\nabandon the brig: they had three carpenters on board, by whom the launch\r\nwas decked and rigged, and they left the _Frederick_ with her channel\r\nplates under water. Having landed, they discovered an Indian ploughing\r\nwith a wooden share: from him they could not obtain supplies; they,\r\nhowever, found that they were in the neighbourhood of Valdavia, and soon\r\napproached the battery of that port, and were humanely received by the\r\ninhabitants. On examination they declared the entire facts of their\r\nescape, and were allowed to reside under promises of protection. They\r\nappealed to the officials as _patriots_, and implored them to take their\r\nlives rather than to restore them to the British. A few months after, H.\r\nM. S. _Blond_, Commodore Mason, excited their alarm; it however passed\r\nover: several married, and the governor and his lady honored the\r\nnuptials of the pirate captain with their presence. Shortly after, they\r\nwere put under friendly arrest, Commodore Mason having applied for them,\r\nand made some preparations to seize them by force; sending an armed\r\nboat, which the Americans repelled. The second \"governor\" was not\r\nequally favorable, but was conciliated by the promise of Barker and\r\nthree others to build him a boat: this accomplished, they seized her and\r\nabsconded. The governor exasperated at the loss, and their\r\nperfidy--probably excited by his harsh treatment, and their constant\r\napprehension of capture--arrested and delivered up their companions to\r\nthe _Blond_; who were sent first to England, and then to Van Diemen's\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nThey were tried in 1837: one of their number raised an objection, which\r\nwas referred to the English judges, and decided in their favor. The\r\ndefence was very ingenious: admitting the vessel was taken, it had never\r\nbeen finished; it belonged to no port; it had received no name: it was\r\ncanvas, rope, boarding, and trenails, put together shipwise--yet it was\r\nnot a legal ship: the seizure might be theft, but not piracy! Upon the\r\nwhole, the prisoners conducted themselves well: however criminal the\r\nescape, their kindness to the people they overpowered; their unusual\r\nunanimity, and prudent acknowledgment of their real circumstances; their\r\nappeal to the _patriots_ for sympathy, and the ingenuity of their\r\ndefence,--must be admitted as exhibiting qualities by no means\r\ndespicable.\r\n\r\nBut never was the government more culpable, or the prisoners less so,\r\nthan in the instance of the _Badger_, a vessel of twenty-five tons,\r\nfreighted with provisions for the East Bay Neck military station (1833).\r\nShe was a fast sailer, and well found, and in charge of a master\r\nmariner, a convict, and convict seamen. The escape was joined, and\r\nprobably planned, by Darby, late a lieutenant in the royal navy, and\r\npresent at the battle of Navarino: a man of small stature but great\r\ndaring. On his passage to the colony he had been implicated in a plot to\r\ntake the vessel, which was partly known to a notorious receiver on\r\nboard,[179] who expected some favor by informing. The plotters intended\r\nto shut down the soldiers and officer, to run for the American coast,\r\nand there allow those who thought proper to land, or to attend the\r\nvessel to her destination. Darby declared that, buried on the shores of\r\nAmerica, he had considerable treasure. On his arrival in Van Diemen's\r\nLand the affair on board was made known to the Governor, by whom Darby\r\nwas told, that if ever he attempted to abscond, or to enlist others in\r\nthe enterprise, he should suffer all the law could inflict. He was,\r\nhowever, placed at the signal station, and afterwards appointed to\r\nassist the water bailiff, and thus had always in view the means of\r\nescape! A convict clergyman, employed as tutor by a member of council,\r\nwas the companion of his flight. The loss of this vessel exemplified the\r\nlaxity of official oversight, where most required. No one could be\r\nsurprised at the escape, which good men suffering in a good cause would\r\nhave naturally ascribed to the favor of Providence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: _Backhouse's Narrative._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: This man had been transported, when eleven years of age,\r\nfor horse-stealing. He was lost off the coast of Boulogne. Swallow died\r\nat Port Arthur.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: On the affair of Ikey Solomon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIV.\r\n\r\nThe escapes of prisoners might be called romantic, could romance enter\r\nthe province of crime. While the first fleet were at anchor off\r\nTeneriffe, John Powers slipped down into a boat attached to the\r\n_Alexander_ transport. He boarded a foreign ship: his offer to enter as\r\nseaman was refused. He then landed beneath some insuperable rocks:\r\nassisted by the governor of the island, his retreat was soon found.\r\n\r\nSuch was the first absconder. The determination to escape from New South\r\nWales, induced the prisoners to listen to every project, and to commit\r\ntheir lives to boats of the most imperfect structure, in which they were\r\nusually lost. But Bryant, an expiree, his wife and two children, and\r\nseven convicts, escaped in a small fishing boat (1790). He had purchased\r\na compass and quadrant, and obtained a chart of his intended course.\r\nThey provided food for the voyage, and the boat was in excellent trim;\r\nthey were met at Timor by the crew of the _Pandora_, sent to the\r\nsouthern seas to arrest the mutineers of the _Bounty_. Bryant professed\r\nto have suffered shipwreck: he was kindly received by the Dutch. He died\r\nat Batavia; also one of his children and two of his companions: the rest\r\nwere afterwards seized, and conveyed to England, where the story of\r\ntheir sufferings excited the public compassion, and they were merely\r\ndetained in Newgate for the unexpired term of their sentence.[180]\r\n\r\nTheir nautical intrepidity and their comparative success, inspirited\r\nfuture attempts. But the most celebrated project was concocted by Irish\r\nconvicts, who proposed an overland passage to China! Of forty-four men\r\nand nine women absent, the greater part perished on this curious\r\nenterprise.[181] Some, after the absence of several weeks, re-appeared,\r\nexhausted with fatigue and hunger. The Governor, finding it impossible\r\nto prevent elopement by punishment, attempted to convince them by\r\nexperience. He furnished some of the strongest with provisions, and\r\nappointed them conductors, that they might proceed as far as possible\r\ntowards the desired land: they returned, only partially convinced that\r\nflight in that direction was hopeless.\r\n\r\nThe imagination of the prisoners pictured an elysium beyond the\r\nmountains. A seductive rumour long prevailed, that in the interior a\r\ncommunity of white persons were living in primitive innocence; but many\r\nyears elapsed, ere the notion obtained the consistence of a story. In\r\n1833, an account was circulated in England, that white people were found\r\nseveral days journey from the north coast of New Holland, in a village\r\nenclosed by a wall to defend them from the natives. They spoke in Dutch,\r\nand stated that their ancestors, among whom were twelve females, came\r\nfrom a distant land; that their vessel was broken; that they travelled\r\nfar towards the rising sun; that many died by fatigue, and the rest\r\nsettled on that spot--a beautiful valley, on the borders of a lake. A\r\nfull description of their habits and customs was given in the _Leeds\r\nMercury_, but which can have no interest to such as disbelieve their\r\nexistence.[182]\r\n\r\nThe _Young Lachlan_, a vessel the property of Capt. Howard, was seized\r\nat the Derwent, by sixteen prisoners (1819). The sails were bent; the\r\nrudder was on board: she was freighted and provisioned for a voyage to\r\nPort Jackson. She lay outside the cove, and was to drop down the river\r\non the morrow. The four seamen were surprised, and shut down below: the\r\ndarkness of the night and a strong wind favored their escape; passing\r\nthe battery, unseen by the guard. At daybreak the pilot boat, with, a\r\nparty of the 48th regiment, gave chase: a sloop, the property of Mr.\r\nBirch, with another detachment, followed. The boat found the seamen on\r\nBrune Island, but both vessels returned without any other success.\r\n\r\nArrived on the coast of Java, the robbers destroyed the vessel by fire.\r\nThey then presented themselves to the authorities as shipwrecked\r\nmariners: their story was believed; but at length they were suspected of\r\npiracy, and imprisoned. Some of them confessed: all, except five, died\r\nat Batavia, to which place they were transmitted, and the survivors were\r\nconveyed to this colony by the _St. Michael_. The _Young Lachlan_ not\r\nbeing on the high seas their offence was not piracy: they were therefore\r\ncharged with stealing only. Their punishment was necessary, but who\r\ncould forget their temptation?\r\n\r\nOne of the more common methods of elopement was to hide in the hold of a\r\nship, often with the connivance of the sailors, until the vessel had\r\ncleared. Scarcely did a ship quit the coast during the first years of\r\nthe colony, without discovering, mostly too soon for the culprits, their\r\nconcealment. Sometimes, to stir them from their stowage, the vessel was\r\nfumigated. Ships calling at Van Diemen's Land often delivered up\r\nabsconders, found after they had weighed anchor.\r\n\r\nWhen secreted runaways were enabled to avoid detection until the ship\r\nhad advanced far on her voyage, they were conveyed to England, and\r\nusually surrendered to the authorities. A soldier, on looking down the\r\nhatchway of the _Dromedary_, when returning to England (1820), saw a\r\nspectre walking the deck below, who requested a glass of water: the\r\nsoldier alarmed, made known the vision; and after a search, a stranger\r\nwas pulled out from among the planks with which the vessel was laden.\r\nHaving said \"we,\" repeatedly, in speaking of his condition, the presence\r\nof another was suspected, and further search discovered his\r\ncompanion.[183]\r\n\r\nMorgan, a Welshman, who concealed himself, was more fortunate: having\r\nmade a considerable sum by his labor, which he was desirous of carrying\r\nhome unbroken, he concealed himself in the hold of a vessel, and after a\r\nfew days appeared on deck. He was carried to London, and handed to the\r\npolice, when he coolly thanked the captain for his passage! He had\r\nsatisfied the law before he ventured on his voyage.[184]\r\n\r\nThe penalties on merchantmen conveying prisoners in a clandestine\r\nmanner, were sufficiently severe. The most remarkable was the instance\r\nof the _General Gates_, an American vessel, which carried off ten\r\nprisoner mechanics, and one free man;--a double violation of the local\r\nlaws. The _Dromedary_, store ship, was instantly sent in pursuit, and\r\ncaptured the vessel at New Zealand. An action for twelve thousand pounds\r\nwas instituted by the Governor, and awarded by the court (1820). The\r\njudge, in his address, dwelt chiefly on the ingratitude of the\r\ndefendant, who, \"being permitted to partake in a valuable fishery, had\r\nabused the hospitality of the country, and had gone into low\r\npublic-houses to entice away their best workmen!\" This, indeed, was the\r\nchief grievance, and occasioned the rigour of the pursuit and capture--a\r\nstretch of power, it was deemed proper to compromise.\r\n\r\nIt was made lawful to arrest any persons suspected of being illegally at\r\nlarge, and to detain them until they \"proved otherwise;\" the onus of\r\nproof resting with the person apprehended: indemnity was provided for\r\nthose who did anything in furtherance of the act. In defence of these\r\npowers it was alleged, that tenacity of the forms of British freedom was\r\nunsuited to a state of society, where of the adults more than one half\r\nwere prisoners; and to distinguish them was impossible. The government\r\nmaintained that free persons, arrested in _bona fide_ error, were bound\r\nto regard their consequent sufferings as a tribute to the welfare of the\r\ncountry; but considering the ungentle spirit and ruthless instruments of\r\nconvict government, it was necessary to check these prerogatives with a\r\nconsiderable responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe arrest of Mackay, a free man, at Swan River, indicated the danger of\r\nundefined powers, and the boundless arrogance of office. He was seized\r\nby the commander of a vessel and delivered to the _Phoenix_ hulk, New\r\nSouth Wales, where, loaded with irons of unusual weight, his clothing\r\nbranded, he was confined with prisoners destined for a penal settlement.\r\nHaving been brought up by a writ from the judges, he was _discharged_,\r\nand _retaken_: again the court interfered, and the man--never known as a\r\nprisoner, against whom nothing but a general suspicion existed; who had\r\nbeen torn away from a distant colony, and exposed to the contemptuous\r\ntreatment of those through whose hands he passed--owed his final\r\nliberation to the interference of an advocate, and the firmness of the\r\njudges. He obtained L200 damages, against which the government appealed,\r\nunsuccessfully, as excessive!\r\n\r\nAbsconding has been punished with various degrees of severity. By the\r\nfirst governors it was held a venial offence: before the law provided\r\nany specific penalty, it was usually flogging or a penal settlement. A\r\ncapital respite was, however, sent to Port Macquarie: within three\r\nmonths he absconded, with several companions, and started to reach\r\nTimor: on his re-capture, he was executed without further trial\r\n(1823).[185]\r\n\r\nA colonial law, of 1827, made it capital to escape from a penal\r\nsettlement. It was intended to prevent a recurrence of those evils which\r\nresulted from the Macquarie Harbour elopements. That it intimidated a\r\nsingle person, to whom the chance of escape was presented, is extremely\r\ndoubtful: that it rendered their efforts more desperate, and their\r\ncourse more sanguinary, is far more probable. No one will contend for\r\nthe right of a prisoner to burst the bonds imposed by a sentence, yet\r\nwill it never appear to justify the sacrifice of life. Such laws are\r\nuseless: they outrage the common sentiments of mankind--more criminal\r\nthan the offences they intend to prevent: they belong to what Lord Bacon\r\nstigmatised as \"the rubrics of blood.\"\r\n\r\nTheir extreme diffidence of each other, has rendered the combined\r\nopposition of prisoners impossible. A guard of two or three soldiers is\r\nsufficient to intimidate hundreds, and to prevent an open effort to\r\nescape. The sentinels have, generally, displayed forbearance and\r\nconsideration--the honorable characteristics of the British soldier.\r\n\r\nGovernor Arthur recommended a declaratory statute, to subdue any doubts\r\nrespecting their right to shoot absconders, which seemed common among\r\nthe military. That right had never been called in question; and in two\r\ninstances only, during fourteen years, was it exercised in this country.\r\nThe sense of responsibility is a healthy emotion: promptitude in taking\r\nthe life of a runaway, however tolerated or authorised by law, could\r\nnever be remembered by a soldier but as an odious execution.[186]\r\n\r\nThe piratical seizure of vessels lately, has not been common: escape is\r\neasy in other forms. The elopement of individuals has been attended with\r\nno great perils, since the establishment of the surrounding colonies.\r\nCraft of small burden have been sometimes taken, and at the close of the\r\nvoyage dismissed. Prisoners have passed as merchandise, or boldly\r\nsubmitting to examination, have been lost in the crowd of emigrants. A\r\ncontrivance was recently discovered, by the fatal consequences which\r\nfollowed it: a woman was enclosed by her husband in a case, and on\r\narriving at Port Phillip was found dead.\r\n\r\nThese instances comprehend most of those forms of escape which are found\r\nin the colonial annals. They prove how powerful the passion for liberty,\r\nwith which, when united to common intelligence, the threats of legal\r\nvengeance, or the vigilance of official guards, cannot cope. The same\r\ninstinct, however, which induces men to break their bonds, restrains\r\nmany more from transgression, and is a powerful auxiliary to the laws.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: Ikey Solomon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: _Collins's New South Wales._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: Clarke, executed at Hobart Town (1835), and who for five\r\nyears wandered among the natives of New South Wales, asserted he had\r\nseen an isolated colony of Malays, or some other nation, the remnant of\r\na shipwreck, which had existed for ages on the borders of a lake in the\r\nfar interior to the north of Sydney.

Papers_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XV.\r\n\r\nThe principles of penal government recognised in the times of Governor\r\nArthur, may be best ascertained from his despatches and orders, and from\r\nthe writings of Dr. Ross, who, if not directly assisted by Arthur, was\r\ninspired by his opinions. Whether those principles were practically\r\napplied, will be known by reference to other testimony. The deviations\r\nmust not, however, be ascribed exclusively, either to the Governor's\r\nconnivance, or to the intrinsic defect of his system. He could not act\r\nalone, and the agents he employed were sometimes incapable, and\r\nsometimes corrupt. In his own writings, he repeatedly alludes to the\r\ngradual approximation to what he deemed perfection of detail: it cost\r\nhim the labor of years.\r\n\r\nThe estimate he formed, philanthropists are slow to entertain: one-third\r\nof those who arrived in these colonies, he rated incorrigible; the rest,\r\nchiefly affected by the prospect of reward or the dread of punishment,\r\nand indifferent to abstract good. In tracing crimes to their causes he\r\nlargely ascribes them to poverty, and the pressure of classes on each\r\nother. He enunciated a novel view of the mental character of\r\ncriminals--that they were subjects of _delirium_; that they saw every\r\nobject through a false medium; and that no treatment could be successful\r\nwhich did not restrain them by an enlightened rigour. This view, given\r\nin a code of rules[187] for the management of road parties, was\r\nattributed to the reasonings of a medical member of his government: the\r\nnotion it embodies, he himself ascribed to long experience in the\r\nmanagement of prisoners. His observation supplied the facts; his\r\ncouncillor, perhaps, constructed the system.\r\n\r\nHe believed that to remove the opportunities of crime, was the only\r\nsuccessful method of general prevention; that to keep the convicts\r\nquiet, to withdraw all external excitement was essential to successful\r\ntreatment of their mental malady. He compared the ordinary offender to a\r\nsteed untrained: very impatient of the curb and rein. The discipline of\r\nthe government, either by its own officers or the master, he likened to\r\na _breaking in_. Under the first application of the bridle, more facile\r\ntempers became at once submissive and docile; or if not--if the man\r\nthrew the master--then came the government with heavier burdens and more\r\npainful restraint: he was caught, and resistance was borne down. The\r\nmilder servitude being unsuccessful, then came magisterial admonition;\r\nthen the lash; then sequestration on the roads; then irons; then the\r\npenal settlement--with its stern aspect, its ponderous labor, and prompt\r\ntorture; in which mercy wrought through terror and pain, and hope itself\r\nwas attired in lighter chains.\r\n\r\nArthur alleged that his system was inductive: reared upon a foundation\r\nof facts, its classification was self-constituted: every step in the\r\nseveral gradations of a prisoner's punishment was the result of his own\r\nwill; the first, by his crime against English society, the residue by\r\nhis misconduct in servitude. It was in his power, when delivered to his\r\nmaster, to work out his own liberty, without knowing again the frown of\r\na magistrate, or the darkness of a dungeon: it was in his choice to\r\ndelay deliverance until death. Thus the distribution and separation\r\nvainly attempted by a direct management of government, was better done\r\nby the prisoners themselves: they determined their own merit by their\r\nactual position, where they awaited pardon and liberty, or gradual\r\ndescent to despair.\r\n\r\nArthur watched with great diligence the operation of his system. The\r\ncharacter of most masters was known: they were bound to make annual\r\nreturns of the number and conduct of their men. Their recommendation was\r\nrequired to procure the prisoner's indulgence: his police character was\r\ndrawn out in form--the parliamentary papers shew into what minute\r\nparticulars those documents entered; even an admonition of the\r\nmagistrates was noted, and made part of the case. _Black_ and _white_\r\nbooks were kept, in which meritorious actions and the reverse were\r\nrecorded. The term of preparatory servitude was four, six, or eight\r\nyears--as the sentence was for seven, fourteen years, or life; then a\r\nticket-of-leave allowed the prisoner to find his own employ, to enjoy\r\nhis own earnings; subject to the surveillance of the police, and to a\r\nforfeiture for breach of its regulations.\r\n\r\nArthur described the police as the pivot of his system: it comprehended\r\nsurveillance and detection. The establishment of district courts, in\r\nwhich a paid magistrate resided, was an essential element of its\r\nsuccess. The masters had a correctional authority at hand: a few miles,\r\noften a few minutes, brought them within the police court, and the\r\npunishment ordered followed the offence by a very short interval. The\r\npolice constables, mostly prisoners of the crown, were selected from\r\neach ship to assist the recognition of their fellow prisoners, and they\r\nwere rewarded for every runaway they arrested. They often shortened\r\ntheir own sentence by procuring the conviction of others; often, too,\r\nthey obtained considerable sums, and even instant liberty, by the\r\ndiscovery of an outlaw. They were acute, expert, and, we are told by\r\nArthur, vigilant beyond all men he ever knew. They were objects of fear\r\nand detestation.\r\n\r\nThe strong will of the prisoners thus encountered opposition on every\r\nhand. They were hedged round with restrictions; they were at the mercy\r\nof the magistrate, and subject to the lash, for offences which language\r\nis not sufficiently copious to distinguish with nicety.[188] Their\r\nunsupported accusations recoiled on themselves. They were entitled to\r\ncomplain, but the evidence they could generally command, was heard with\r\nnatural suspicion. So well did they understand the hopelessness of\r\ncontest, that they rarely replied, where a defence sometimes aggravated\r\ntheir punishment.\r\n\r\nThe convict was subject to the caprice of all his master's household: he\r\nwas liable every moment to be accused, and punished.[189] Unknown,\r\nwithout money, he had no protector or advocate: one magistrate could\r\nauthorise fifty lashes; one hundred could be inflicted by the\r\nconcurrence of a second. It was asserted by Arthur, that the statement\r\nof their liabilities produced an expression of dismay in the\r\ncountenances of convicts newly arrived. The indefinite character of\r\nthese offences; the boundless discretion of the magistrate; the\r\ninfluence of the master; the presumption always against the accused; the\r\ndreadful nature of several of the punishments--doubtless created in many\r\nthe recklessness of defiance and despair. A prisoner's sentence might be\r\nextended one or three years; he might be doomed to a penal settlement\r\nand chains. Nor could he liberate himself from his servitude: he came\r\nback from the triangles or road party, and stood at his master's door.\r\n\r\nThe determined resistance of change, except for punishment; the\r\nindissoluble tie of men to masters--was one part of Arthur's plan. The\r\nknowledge that submission was the only chance of happiness, caused many\r\nto yield to their destiny without a struggle; and where masters were\r\nhumane, the connection lasted, without murmuring or oppression, until\r\nthe close; but with many more, it was a period of misery, mental and\r\nbodily--the fierce passions breaking into open war, and seeking nothing\r\nbut revenge or freedom. The rolls of the muster-master exhibit curious\r\ninstances of this long struggle: there are several now before the\r\nwriter, in which punishments succeed each other with a frequency so\r\nterrible, that the mind is only relieved by the belief that sensibility\r\nis destroyed by incurable misery.\r\n\r\nGovernor Arthur addressed a despatch, on \"secondary punishments,\" to\r\nViscount Goderich, intended to answer the report of the select committee\r\nof 1832. He thought the witnesses were not conversant with the state of\r\nthe prisoners--a fact not surprising, since even the effect of English\r\npenitentiaries was debated under their very walls. The gentle system of\r\nGovernor Macquarie was a tradition among the criminal population of\r\nGreat Britain; but in this country, colonised at a later date, and by\r\nsettlers of a higher class, the advantages of the convict were small,\r\nand his control more complete. Arthur thus delineated the condition of\r\nthe assigned servant: deprived of indulgence, living in the interior,\r\nemployed in clearing and cultivating forest land, allowed no wages;\r\nidleness, even looks betraying an insurgent spirit, exposing him to the\r\nchain gang or the triangle; deprived of liberty, subject to the caprice\r\nof a family, and to the most summary laws. He was a slave, except that\r\nhis master was not trusted with the lash, and his claim for service\r\nterminable. True, he was well fed, while many in England labored hard,\r\nand yet were hungry and poor; but nothing reconciled the prisoner to\r\nbondage: he compared his condition not with the British pauper, but\r\ntheirs who, though working in the same field, were masters of their own\r\nlabor. He asserted that the bravado of persons, who affected\r\nindifference when ordered for Macquarie Harbour, was fully answered by\r\nthe murderers who, to enjoy a momentary escape, ventured their lives; by\r\nthe desperate efforts of many to conceal themselves in vessels,\r\ndeprived of food for days, and tortured until their limbs mortified; by\r\nthe despair of many rioters who arrived in the _Eliza_, who, dejected\r\nand stupified by grief, soon drooped and died. He maintained that\r\ntransportation, though not absolutely successful, was to be preferred,\r\nas frequently most dreaded, reformatory, and final.\r\n\r\nHe maintained, that the current reports respecting transportation\r\ndeserved no credence, and were unsafe as foundations of public policy.\r\nOften, from the most selfish motives, the most delusive statements had\r\nbeen forwarded by prisoners. He instanced a woman from Liverpool, who\r\narrived with her four children, allured by the representation of her\r\nhusband, and sent out by the charity of his prosecutors; and who had\r\ninformed her that, beside L60 per annum, he was lodged and fed for his\r\nlabor. In this case, however, the man wrote falsely; but at that moment\r\nthere were many who might have made the statement with truth.\r\n\r\nIn the despatches of Governor Arthur there is much acute observation and\r\njust inference. He had actually lessened abuses, until they became not\r\nvery common or very flagrant: by collecting men in the employ of\r\ngovernment under a more rigid system of superintendence, he had\r\ncurtailed their indulgence, and made their condition more irksome. But\r\nit is well known to every colonist, that throughout his administration\r\nsome prisoners were favored with greater liberty than others; that they\r\naccumulated property, and had at command whatever money could buy. He\r\noften, with a discretion both wise and humane, mitigated the severity of\r\na sentence and alleviated the domestic desolation of a wife, by granting\r\nsome indulgence to her husband. It is told to his credit as a man,\r\nalthough it does not add to the weight of his despatches.\r\n\r\nThe enunciation of principles was not common in the writings of Governor\r\nArthur; he, however, states his view of the objects contemplated by\r\npunishment. He held that the severity of a penalty was to be measured by\r\nthe operation of the crime on society,--or the views taken by\r\nlegislators of its effect. Unhappily, this theory overlooks the fact,\r\nthat penalties are usually for the protection of classes, rather than\r\ncommunities. The severe laws against poaching have never been vindicated\r\non the principles of equity or national right: they are the laws of an\r\naristocracy, for the protection of its pleasures. The unlimited power\r\nover life and liberty claimed by this doctrine, would excuse the Spartan\r\nmethod of anticipating crime. It is the old code of the opulent and\r\npowerful; but it is essentially unjust, fallacious, and therefore\r\nuseless and wicked.[190] It is probable, however, that abstract opinions\r\nmaintained but a slight influence on his actual policy, and that by his\r\nstrong perception of the interest of society in the reform of the\r\noffender, he adopted many practical lessons of philanthropy.\r\n\r\nGovernor Arthur was directed by the Secretary of State to assign the\r\nprisoners employed on public works: such as were unfit for the service\r\nof settlers to form into gangs, and employ on stations distant from the\r\ntowns. Lord Goderich had come to the conclusion that the service of\r\ngovernment was rather courted than dreaded by the prisoners. This plan\r\nwas skilfully resisted by Arthur: he admitted that constables and\r\nmessengers were favorably situated. So great, however, were the\r\nhardships of those employed in public works, that his conscience was\r\ntroubled, and only relieved by remembering that they were the worst of\r\noffenders; or, if better conducted, passed at length into the\r\nloan-gang--a condition as preferable to assignment, as was assignment to\r\nthe service of the crown: thus balancing the advantages of their last\r\nagainst the severity of the first stage. He stated their assignment, so\r\nfar from increasing the severity of punishment, their faults, and even\r\ncrimes, would be covered by their masters, to preserve their labor;\r\ntheir earnings would place them beyond the condition of their class in\r\nGreat Britain; and when their fortune should be known, they would never\r\nwant for successors. But he appealed to a still more cogent argument.\r\nThe expense of a convict mechanic to the crown, was one shilling per\r\nday; of a free artizan, seven to ten shillings: the difference would go\r\nto the workmen, to bribe their industry and gratify their vices. It was\r\nnot, perhaps, known fully to Arthur, that at the moment he sealed his\r\ndespatch, forty mechanics lodged in one ward, who earned not much less\r\nthan L50 per week, by the leisure hours they enjoyed.[191] It was,\r\nhowever, true, that the inducement to pay large sums for occasional\r\nlabor, arose from the difficulty of obtaining it: few mechanics were\r\ntransported; so few, as to excite astonishment.[192]\r\n\r\nBut however exact and successful transportation, in Governor Arthur's\r\nopinion, a variety of causes contributed to excite in England a powerful\r\nprejudice against it, and to lead the ministers to interfere with some\r\nof its details of great practical consequence. The gradual amelioration\r\nof the criminal code--a restriction of capital punishments, demanded by\r\nthe humanity of the British public--was allowed by the ruling classes\r\nwith doubt and grudging. Some conspicuous cases confirmed their\r\npredilection in favor of the scaffold. What punishment, they asked,\r\nwould transportation have proved to Fontleroy, who from the spoil of his\r\nextensive forgeries, might have reserved an ample fortune? It was\r\nreported, and not untruly, that many had carried to the penal colonies\r\nthe profit of their crime; that the wife had been assigned to the\r\nnominal service of her husband; or, still more preposterous, the husband\r\ncommitted to the control of the wife--and were enabled at once to invest\r\ntheir capital in whatever form might promise success.\r\n\r\nSeveral volumes issued in succession from the British press, full of\r\nhighly colored sketches of colonial life; in which the advantages\r\npossessed by many emancipists, the splendour of their equipage, and the\r\nluxurious profligacy of their lives, were exhibited as the larger prizes\r\nof a fruitful lottery. Among these works, the most popular, that of\r\nCunningham, professed to delineate the sentiments of the prisoners, from\r\nwhich it might be inferred that few conditions of human life offered so\r\nmany chances of gaiety and prosperity.[193]\r\n\r\nAbout the same period, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, of a talented family,\r\nand afterwards distinguished by his connection with colonisation, was\r\nimprisoned in Newgate for the abduction of Miss Turner. During three\r\nyears' residence he professes to have devoted great attention to the\r\nsubject of transportation. Few sessions passed but some prisoner,\r\nformerly transported, appeared under a second charge. In conversing upon\r\ntheir prospects, they described the country of their former exile in\r\nterms of high eulogy. It was the opinion of Wakefield that, as a\r\npunishment, it had no influence in preventing crime. The evidence of\r\nseveral settlers from New South Wales was of the same character; and\r\nM'Queen, a member of parliament, long resident in that country, stated\r\nthat he had been often asked what offence would be sufficient to ensure\r\ntransportation.[194] The letters received from the prisoners, recorded\r\ntheir good fortune, and were read by their former acquaintances. They\r\nwere filled with exaggerations, dictated by vanity or affection; and\r\nseemed to convey an impression that, of their families, they only were\r\nfortunate.\r\n\r\nA colonist is certainly not entitled to deny, that many strong cases of\r\nperversion occurred; but, except the superiority of diet, and the high\r\nvalue of labor common to new countries when they prosper at all, the\r\ndescriptions given were mostly illusive and mistaken. The extreme misery\r\nand degradation endured by many, and to which all were liable, rendered\r\nthe ordinary condition of prisoners one which could not have been\r\ndesired, except by the most wretched of the people.\r\n\r\nNew South Wales was regarded, by the laughing portion of the British\r\npublic, as a perpetual beggar's opera. One eminent writer said, that the\r\npeople of these colonies attracted attention only from the curiosity\r\nthey excited: mankind were amused to know what form would be assumed by\r\na community, composed of men who narrowly escaped the executioner. By\r\nanother they were compared to an old fashioned infant, which had all the\r\nvices and deformity of a corrupt constitution and precocious passions.\r\nThe exhibition of a panorama of Sydney in the metropolis of England,\r\nattracted large crowds. It was hardly possible to exaggerate the charms\r\nof its scenery, when clothed in the radiant verdure of the spring; but\r\nthe dwellings were drawn, not only in their just proportions, but with\r\nall the grace of the pencil--cabins looked like bowers. The poet,\r\nCampbell, struck with the glowing harmony, exclaimed, how delightful to\r\nthe London thief--beneath the clear sky and amidst the magnificent\r\nforests of Australia,\r\n\r\n\"Where Sydney Cove its lucid bosom swells\"--\r\n\r\nto shake the hand he once encountered in the same pocket at Covent Garden\r\ntheatre! It is thus, too often, that substantial interests are sacrificed\r\nto humour. No one, acquainted with the minds of prisoners, can imagine\r\nthat the purest atmosphere, or most exhilarating prospect, would be\r\nhalf so attractive to a veteran robber, as the murky cellars of the\r\n\"London Shades.\"\r\n\r\nThe writings of Archbishop Whately tended to the same result. Against\r\nthe principles of transportation he entered an earnest protest, not only\r\nas defeating the primary objects of a penalty, but as constituting a\r\ncommunity charged with the elements of future mischief. He reasoned in\r\nhis closet, and formed his conclusions from a process of investigation\r\nwhich was not complete: he overlooked some facts which tended largely to\r\nneutralise the evil, and that suppress or defeat propensities which\r\nthrive in Europe. He made many senatorial converts, and those he did not\r\nconvince, in reference to his main proposition, were anxious to obviate\r\nhis objections.\r\n\r\nTo meet, however, the views which prevailed, and which were strongly\r\nrecommended by the parliamentary committee of 1832, the government\r\ndetermined to increase the rigour of transportation. The effects of the\r\nFrench revolution, and the pressure of commercial distress, had produced\r\na strong tendency to crime. In the agricultural districts of England\r\nriot and arson were prevalent: the utmost exertion of the laborer did\r\nnot preserve his family from want. Depredations upon game, and other\r\nspecies of rural property, exasperated the legislative class. The hulks\r\nwere crowded: it was proposed to establish a penitentiary at Dartmoor,\r\nlong the site of a French prison, and employ the convicts in cutting\r\ngranite for sale; but the discussions in parliament manifested the\r\nstrong preference of the agricultural interests for a system of absolute\r\nbanishment. It was observed by Peel, that the detention of prisoners\r\nexposed the government to endless annoyance, and before half their time\r\nwas expired the solicitation of their friends often procured a\r\nremission.\r\n\r\nPending these enquiries, a rumour reached the colony that transportation\r\nwas abolished. The papers broke out in the language of wailing and woe:\r\nthe _Courier_, especially, gave utterance to the most passionate grief.\r\nThe editor described the melancholy visage of the settlers, and the\r\ndifferent expressions of vexation and disappointment which he heard\r\naround him. One declaiming against the perfidy of government, and\r\nanother delineating the ruin involved in the fatal resolution. Some\r\nthreatening to leave the country ruled by covenant breakers, who, in the\r\nspirit of reckless experiment, were not only demolishing the finest\r\nimaginable system of penal discipline, but sacrificing the fortunes of\r\ncolonists, who had emigrated in the confidence that convicts would\r\nfollow them in an uninterrupted stream.[195] These apprehensions were\r\nbut temporary. The strong representations of Governor Arthur, and the\r\nextreme difficulty of change, secured a further trial under new\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne held a consultation with Mr. Stanley. He suggested that\r\nthe increase of crime had arisen partly from ignorance of the actual\r\nconsequences of transportation. He requested him to reflect upon this\r\ntopic, and to determine whether it might not be proper to send\r\ntransgressors through a more rigorous discipline on their landing, and\r\nto stop the comparative ease and comfort it was customary to enjoy.[196]\r\nMr. Stanley undertook to contrive a scheme, which should terminate the\r\nindifference with which banishment was regarded. He had said that he\r\nwould render the punishment of transportation more dreaded than death\r\nitself. At his suggestion Lord Melbourne addressed a letter to the\r\njudges, and requested them, when on their circuits, to explain the\r\nextent of torment which banishment included; to select such as they\r\nmight deem it proper to separate to a more terrific form of punishment;\r\nand to declare, in a public manner, the degree of severity which would\r\nfollow a particular sentence.\r\n\r\nIt was determined that the more hardened should be confined at Norfolk\r\nIsland or Macquarie Harbour; and that no prisoner for life should be\r\nwithdrawn from a penal settlement, until seven years of his sentence was\r\npassed, or until one-third of a shorter period was completed. Then\r\ndrafted to the roads: after wearing chains a further five years, he\r\nmight be assigned to a master, and commence his probation. The less\r\nguilty were to join the road party at once, and in seven years be\r\nliberated from their chains. Mr. Stanley forwarded sixteen persons in\r\nthe _Southwell_, whom he directed should be kept in chains for the first\r\nseven years of their bondage. He thus established the system,\r\ndistinguished as the \"certain and severe\" in the orders of government;\r\nand for several years described by the journals, as the \"worse than\r\ndeath\" system of Mr. Secretary Stanley.[197]\r\n\r\nThe object of Stanley was to invest transportation with novel terrors,\r\nand to give a more tragic aspect to the law. He did not, however,\r\nreflect, that he who has destroyed hope has also made the despairing\r\nworthless; that the victim will have recourse to violence or\r\ninsensibility--that when he cannot rupture he will hug his bonds. He did\r\nnot perceive that no Englishman would accept the service of a felon, who\r\nfor twelve years had experienced the misery of chains--that it was not\r\nas prisoners, but as husbandmen, that the poachers and rioters of\r\nEngland were acceptable to the Australian farmer; who was reconciled to\r\npenal slavery, only when disguised under semi-patriarchal forms.\r\n\r\nThe change proposed by Stanley was greatly disliked by Arthur. It was\r\nthe reverse of his system. Whatever influences were brought into action\r\nby agricultural service, would be lost in a gang. He foresaw the\r\ndespondency, the oppression of the prisoners, and the gradual alienation\r\nof the colonists. Arthur referred Stanley's despatch to the executive\r\ncouncil, with his own rejoinder. His system of twelve years bondage and\r\nchains was unanimously reprobated: the council concurred in the opinion\r\nof the Governor, that it would break up the gradations of punishment;\r\nand unless sustained by a large reinforcement of military, endanger the\r\npublic safety and produce habits of outrage and revenge.[198] Whatever\r\ninfluence these representations possessed, the plan was abandoned of\r\nnecessity. The chief justice of New South Wales advised the Governor\r\nthat the law had not authorised the arbitrary addition of chains to a\r\nsentence of transportation--to increase the misery, not to add to the\r\nsafe keeping of the prisoners. Such, on reference, was the opinion of\r\nthe English legal authorities, and the men in irons were released.[199]\r\n\r\nWhatever the motives of Lord Stanley, the transmission of such an order,\r\nwithout ascertaining the authority under which it was issued, was a\r\nserious official error. It is probable, that the persons injured had no\r\nmeans of appeal, and deserved no redress; but when it is remembered,\r\nthat the law does not profess to determine the moral enormity of an\r\noffence by the extent of punishment, to aggravate a penalty which the\r\nlegislators deemed equal to the crime--avowedly to make it more terrible\r\nthan death itself--was a stretch of official power, which can scarcely\r\nbe explained.\r\n\r\nSt. Paul denounced the judge who smote contrary to the law. Mr.\r\nStanley's encroachment on the functions of legislation was only more\r\ndefensible because less corrupt. To repress colonial disorders, the\r\nlocal government had, indeed, grafted the penalties he prescribed on the\r\ncolonial statute book; but the despotic interference of a secretary of\r\nstate was specially objectionable. Persons sentenced to transportation\r\nfor political or agrarian crimes, were not unlikely to provoke the\r\npersonal hatred of ministers, and therefore to suffer a vengeance beyond\r\nthe intention of the judges, or the spirit of the laws.\r\n\r\nTo render corruption more difficult, the power of the governors was\r\nlimited by statute. They had granted tickets-of-leave for the discovery\r\nof outlaws, the detection of serious crimes, and any service of great\r\npublic utility. They had been often swayed by feelings of humanity in\r\nhastening the liberation of men, whose families required their care; but\r\nan Act \"for abolishing the punishment of death in certain cases,\"[200]\r\nnot only fixed the time when prisoners should be capable of\r\ntickets-of-leave, but abstracted the chief advantages a ticket\r\nconferred. They were excluded from the protection of civil laws, and\r\nthus thrown on the mercy of any who might employ them. These clauses\r\nwere introduced by Lord Wynford (Sergeant Best), and were intended to\r\nequalise the punishment of offenders, and to prevent an early enjoyment\r\nof plunder. This restriction was, however, practically unjust. The grant\r\nof a ticket-of-leave was to enable a man to procure a livelihood: to\r\ndeprive him of legal resource, was to invite the swindler and the cheat\r\nto make his earnings and acquisitions their prey. The local courts had\r\nhitherto resisted the injustice by evasion: a record of conviction being\r\nrequired to stay a civil action; although in the criminal courts it was\r\nsufficient to prove that the person accused had been dealt with as a\r\ntransported offender.\r\n\r\nLord Wynford's Act made no such distinction. Its provision, probably the\r\nresult of inadvertence, was so palpably a contradiction, that it was\r\nnever acted upon in Van Diemen's Land, and was earnestly deprecated by\r\nall classes. To grant a prisoner liberty to seek subsistence, and yet\r\nsuffer any fraudulent person to deprive him of his just wages, could\r\narise only from that confusion of ideas, too common in legislation on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: \"It can scarcely be doubted, that the main body of\r\nconvicts are under mental delirium--they see and appreciate every thing\r\nthrough a false medium; and as, from long experience and close\r\nobservation, the Lieutenant-Governor is confident that a firm and\r\ndetermined, but mild and consistent supervision, is the very best to be\r\nfollowed, in order to remove the infirmity under which they labor, it is\r\nthe treatment he enjoins shall be uniformly observed!\"--_Regulations\r\nissued to the Roads' Department._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: \"Absconding, insubordination, drunkenness, indecent\r\nconduct, neglect or wilful mismanagement of work, neglect of duty,\r\nindecent or abusive language, swearing, insolence, or other disorderly\r\nconduct.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: Arthur.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: Arthur's despatch to Lord Goderich.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: It was not uncommon for four in their number to consume\r\none gallon of rum at a sitting.

A gentleman, who came home passenger in the same\r\nvessel with myself, brought with him a convict as a domestic. I asked\r\nhim what were his future plans? He replied, that he meant to go and see\r\nhis mother, if she was alive; but if she was dead, he, to use his own\r\nwords, would 'frisk a crib,' (_Anglice_--rob a shop) or do something to\r\nlag him for seven years again, as he was perfectly aware that he could\r\nnot work hard enough to get his living in England.\"--_Widowson's present\r\nstate of V. D. Land_, 1829. p. 65.\r\n\r\n\"In order to show the opinions entertained by some of the convicts, as\r\nregards the colony, I will give an extract from one of the sundry\r\nletters which I have read, written by them to their friends in England,\r\nusing the writer's own language and punctuation, but altering the\r\nspelling. He requests that his wife will come out, and bring their\r\nchildren with her, and then proceeds as follows: 'I am perfectly well\r\nsatisfied with my situation thanks be to God that has placed me under\r\nthose that does not despise a prisoner. No, my love, I am (not?) treated\r\nas a prisoner but as a free man, there is no one to say a wrong word to\r\nme. I have good usage, plenty of good meat, and clothes with easy work.\r\nI have 362 sheep to mind, either of our lads could do it with ease. The\r\nbest of men was shepherds. Jacob served for his wife, yea and for a wife\r\ndid he keep sheep and so will I, and my love we shall be more happy here\r\nthan ever we should be at home if happiness is to be found on the earth.\r\nDon't fail to come out I never thought this country what I have found\r\nit. I did expect to be in servile bondage and to be badly used but I am\r\nbetter off this day than half the people in England, and I would not go\r\nback to England if any one would pay my passage. England has the name of\r\na free country and this is a bond country, but shame my friends and\r\ncountrymen where is your boasted freedom. Look round you, on every side\r\nthere is distress, rags, want, and all are in one sorrowful state of\r\nwant. Happiness and prosperity has long taken their flight from Albion's\r\nonce happy isle.' He then alludes to the low price of provisions, and\r\nadds--'Except you live in a town you have no rent to pay, for each\r\nbuilds his own house, no tithes, no poor-rates, and no taxes of any\r\nkind. And this is bondage is it?' There are some other amusing remarks\r\nin this original composition, but the above will suffice to show that\r\nconvicts lead not always the unhappy life they are supposed to do,\r\nunless through their own bad conduct. The writer of the above letter\r\nbears such an excellent character that his master has sent to England\r\nfor his wife and family, with the intention of trying to be of some use\r\nto them.\"--_Breton's New South Wales_, p. 281.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: Potter M'Queen's evidence before the Commons, 1831.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: _Courier_, 1831.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: May 20th, 1833.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: Stanley's despatch, August, 1833.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: February 3rd, 1834.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: _Par.

They were\r\nnot authorised to claim wages, but their employers prompted their\r\nindustry by its usual recompense. Their value as workmen often secured\r\nthem an appearance which surpassed the common means of English\r\nartificers, or they expended their earnings during paroxysms of\r\nintemperance. The power to grant the assistance of skilled workmen, and\r\nthe custom of the officers to borrow them for their own service, excited\r\nunceasing murmurs. Master tradesmen complained, that their callings were\r\nfollowed by captains and lieutenants, whose journeymen were the\r\nprisoners of the crown, and who, beside the emoluments of office,\r\nengrossed the profits of smiths and carpenters--of tailors and\r\nshoemakers. Those settlers, excluded from participation in the _loan_\r\nlabor, denounced the venal partiality of its distribution. Long lists\r\nwere published of workmen allotted to the relatives and confidants of\r\nthe Governor, to display his unwearied nepotism.\r\n\r\nThe educated prisoners occasioned still greater complaint. At an early\r\nperiod, many of the higher functionaries were utterly ignorant of\r\naccounts, and were glad to employ the abilities which transportation\r\nplaced at their disposal. Curious anecdotes are told of the profits\r\nderived by this class of scribes, by the distribution of royal clemency:\r\nthus the indents were altered by a clerk, who charged L10 for reducing\r\nconsiderably the duration of a sentence.[201] At a later date, a\r\nprisoner offered by letter L15 for his conditional pardon. The bearer\r\ngave information of its contents to another convict in office, who\r\noffered to obtain the \"royal mercy\" for L10, and he did so.[202] The\r\nreliance frequently placed in the fidelity of their penmanship,\r\nsometimes modified the details of punishment.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of a board appointed by Arthur, it appeared that\r\nsixty-six were employed in the various departments. The evidence is\r\nvaluable, from the statements it contains respecting the condition and\r\ninfluence of this class. They were represented to be quick, intelligent\r\nmen, and were preferred because more easily commanded--if not\r\ncontrolled. Their office hours usually terminating at 4 o'clock, they\r\nobtained considerable sums as book-keepers. All correspondence, except\r\ndespatches to the British government, and communications with the\r\njudges, passed under their eye. They were employed in taking\r\ndepositions, and received bribes for expediting indulgences. Their\r\nacquaintance with the probable demands of the commissariat, was a source\r\nof emolument: they sold information to the shopkeepers, and thus\r\nenhanced the price. Arthur professed to deplore the necessity of their\r\nemployment; a practice which long survived his government.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a mournful sight, to behold men of better hopes sink\r\ninto habits of intemperance; and for a long series of years pass through\r\na succession of punishments, often for trifling infractions of the penal\r\ncode--to see them display the utmost facility in penmanship, and to hear\r\nat every movement the rattle of chains. Yet these prodigal sons of many\r\na desolated house, were not so much objects of compassion, as those\r\nwhose peace they had blighted with an incurable affliction. No one could\r\nimagine how many families, distinguished for rank, benevolence, and\r\npiety--known at home as the fortunate and happy--had in these regions\r\nunhappy relations, whose fate must have cast dark shadows on their own.\r\nMany, however, protected their kindred from public dishonor by the\r\nchange of their names: they not unfrequently were overtaken by crime and\r\npunishment, having long left the dwellings of their fathers, whose\r\nreputation they spared by artifice and silence.\r\n\r\nThe wives of prisoners, who once moved in the higher circles, often\r\nexhibited an example of complicated virtue. What they took from the\r\nmisery of their husbands they added to their own; and even by their\r\nparticipation rendered more intense the mental anguish they came to\r\nremove. Delicately reared, familiar with the comforts of affluence, they\r\nresolutely abandoned all. No entreaty, maternal tears, or offers of\r\nsupport, could change the purpose of conscience and affection. They\r\ngathered up the fragments of their shivered fortunes to venture on a\r\nlonely voyage, and encounter a rough courtesy--generous, when not\r\nbrutal; to solicit commiseration from the harsh delegates of a nation's\r\nvengeance, or the hucksters of its mercy. Sad lot! fraught with anguish,\r\nwith terror, and trembling: every moment passed in fear of some new\r\nfetter--of some fresh official caprice, or sudden separation! Such\r\nscenes of mental and physical martyrdom have been often known to\r\nprofessional men, who enter the interior of life, and watch the\r\noperations of secret sorrow. The mould of Tasmania covers many a\r\ntrue-hearted woman, whose constancy and self devotion are registered on\r\nhigh; and which, in another sphere, might command the admiration of the\r\nworld!\r\n\r\nThe colonial government interdicted the connection of prisoners with the\r\npress, which, however, was not prevented or punished, when loyal to the\r\nauthorities. Their writings were commonly laudatory of the officials,\r\neven when most offensive to the colonists. They were not always the most\r\ntrucculent and unprincipled; although the censorship of public morals\r\nand political measures was unsuited to their civil condition.\r\n\r\nAmong those thus employed was Savary, once an opulent sugar baker at\r\nBristol, who in 1824 was convicted of forgery, and his life spared by an\r\nexercise of mercy then novel. Happier far, had he died! He wrote for\r\nthe press--on the right side. On the accusation of a colonist, his\r\nticket-of-leave was withdrawn; but he was spared the usual penalty of\r\nbanishment by the kindness of his patrons, who granted him another form\r\nof liberty. This man was followed by his wife; but on her arrival, her\r\naffection was seduced, or exhausted, and she returned to England. Savary\r\nattempted suicide, recovered, and again fell into crime: he was tried by\r\nJudge Montague, convicted of a colonial forgery, and afterwards died at\r\nPort Arthur--an awful instance of the effects of transgression; and of\r\nthe proneness of men to repeat a crime they have once committed.[203]\r\n\r\nIt having been resolved to abandon Macquarie Harbour (1832), the\r\ngovernment fixed on Port Arthur, on the east coast, as the site of a\r\nsettlement where the rigour of discipline might be preserved. This\r\ndistrict is situated on a peninsula within a peninsula, and contains\r\nabout 100,000 acres of woodland--barren, but not repulsive. A neck of\r\n450 yards broad, divides Tasman's and Forrestier's Peninsulas: there\r\nlamps are set on posts, to which fierce dogs are chained; and to close\r\nthe passage by the shore, when opened by the recession of the tide,\r\nothers are kennelled on a floating platform. Sentinels, guard-boats, and\r\ntelegraphs, are the precautions employed to prevent escape; which few\r\nhave attempted, and fewer still accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe first commandant was Surgeon John Russell; an office subsequently\r\nconfided to Captain O'Hara Booth, a gentleman whose administration has\r\nbeen the subject of great eulogy. A minute code of government\r\nregulations defined the duties of all on the station. Hither all\r\nconvicted of colonial crimes, or of more serious misconduct as assigned\r\nservants or in the road gangs, or who were separated to more than\r\nordinary punishment by the secretary of state, or of the educated class,\r\nwere sent. The degrees of punishment were, however, varied; and the more\r\nsevere was exhausting and dangerous. The carrying gang, with a massive\r\nbalk on the shoulders, resembled a huge centipede. The laborers,\r\nsometimes thirty together, groaning beneath a weight of many tons,\r\nobtained no respite from toil. The slippery and inclining ground exposed\r\nthem to terrific perils: when they complained of inability to bear\r\ntheir burden, they were flogged, taken back, and compelled, by\r\nsupernatural effort, to raise the load they had laid down. The numerous\r\norders were enforced without momentary relaxation, and the scourge was\r\nthe chief agent of control.\r\n\r\nWhen the settlement was new, the men suffered from scurvy; they were\r\nnot, subsequently, unhealthy: diseases of the heart formed a large\r\nproportion of their maladies. Many instances of great hardship have been\r\nauthenticated; and several committed murder to be removed from misery by\r\na public execution. The possession of a piece of tobacco was penal, and\r\nfor this offence alone multitudes were flogged; but its use was only\r\nlimited by the supply: many men would have risked the rack, rather than\r\nrejected this valued indulgence. A wesleyan missionary was accustomed to\r\nreward his servant with the luxury, until he found that being\r\ndistributed, others were involved in punishment. Visitors usually\r\ncarried tobacco, which they dropped on the tramway by which they were\r\nconveyed; and even when the prohibitions were most severely enforced,\r\nmoney would procure a supply.\r\n\r\nThe effect of Capt. Booth's administration was soon visible: the\r\nstoutest hearted gave way. Inexorably just, according to the system he\r\nrepresented, the accused might plead, but were never pardoned. The\r\ngentlemen convicts, clad in a prison dress, were employed in lighter\r\nlabor and worked together; but were transferred to more penal gangs, for\r\nthe least disorder. It is said that the terrors of Port Arthur were\r\npreventive of crime; that its rigour controlled and reformed, for the\r\ntime, such as were sent there; but, both by those who vindicated, and\r\nthose who condemned its severity, it is admitted that relapses were\r\nusual;[204] that it operated on the will by mechanical force, but\r\ndebased the soul.\r\n\r\nHowever heavy the hand of authority, it was not capricious. The\r\noverseers and constables were less brutal than at the road parties and\r\nprevious penal stations. Compared with every other settlement of its\r\nclass, Port Arthur, during Booth's management, was more humane because\r\nmore equal and impartial. Constantly exhibited as a place of profound\r\nmisery, it carried the vengeance of the law to the utmost limits of\r\nhuman endurance.\r\n\r\nIt would be improper to withhold the common testimony in favor of this\r\nofficer, of whom the writer never heard a prisoner speak with reproach:\r\nhe was detested only as the personification of unimpassioned severity.\r\nHe gave all the weight of his example to promote the success of the\r\nmissionary, and paid him respect in the sight of the prisoners. Time\r\nsoftens all things, and Captain Booth, on calm reflection, deserves to\r\nbe remembered with respect, as an officer who took no pleasure in the\r\nsufferings he inflicted--who was as prompt to reward as to punish. A\r\nfurther detail is needless, and would add no new illustration of\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nThe interest which Arthur took in the settlement which bears his name,\r\nmay be inferred from his frequent visits, and the large promises which\r\nhe offered in reference to its future prosperity. He thought seven\r\nthousand men might be sent there, to be detained six months on an\r\naverage; and that the large consumption and expenditure would be repaid\r\nby the produce of their labor. From an early date, Port Arthur possessed\r\nthe advantage of schools and ministerial attendance. A church, of\r\nhandsome exterior, was erected.[205]\r\n\r\nAs the settlement improved, a tramway formed of hard wood, crossed a\r\nspace of five miles, and thus connected the opposite bays. On this road,\r\ntravellers were conveyed by human labor, a large proportion of the\r\ndistance being, however, overcome by spontaneous locomotion.\r\n\r\nThe denizens of Port Arthur would furnish a curious collection of\r\nbiography: the muster would be a living calendar. Among the more\r\ncelebrated were, Ikey Solomon, the receiver, whom they made constable:\r\nthe chartists--men, in whose fate millions have publicly expressed an\r\ninterest. There was Collins, the mad sailor, who threw a stone at the\r\nlast king; May, who murdered the Italian boy; and Cohen, a jew, who\r\nresigned himself to despair, and refusing sustenance, died: they now\r\nrest in the \"_Isle de Mort_.\"\r\n\r\nThe establishment at Point Puer was intended to reclaim and control,\r\nrather than to punish, the unfortunate youth submitted to its\r\ndiscipline. Until a very late period, boys had been transmitted to the\r\ncolonies in company with the men, and were treated without much\r\ndiscrimination: some at an age to understand crime only as a trick, or\r\nto deserve aught except pity and correction. Thus at Preston, a child,\r\nonly seven years old, was transported for life. A boy, three years\r\nolder, perhaps the same, called by his fellow prisoners, \"King John,\"\r\nafter three years imprisonment, arrived in this colony (1829) with sixty\r\nother lads; of whom, on their embarkation, not one in twenty could\r\nrepeat the Lord's prayer.[206] It was stated by a Lord Mayor of London,\r\nthat nothing could be kinder than to transport juvenile offenders to a\r\ncountry where their labor would be useful and their prosperity sure. It\r\nmay be presumed, that in this spirit a girl and two boys were committed\r\nto take their trial for stealing some wood, valued at twopence, the\r\nproperty of the crown.[207] These acts of severity forcibly contrast\r\nwith the happier fortunes of other classes. It is said of George III,\r\nthat he arrested two Eton boys in the act of poaching: they took him for\r\na keeper, and offered their pocket-money as a bribe. He threatened to\r\ninform their master; but next day sent them a present, requesting them\r\nto cease their depredations. They were peers when the monarch told the\r\nstory, and he observed that they were most rigorous preservers of their\r\ngame--\"according to the old proverb, set a thief to catch a thief,\" said\r\nthe king! A better authenticated anecdote was given by Lord Eldon, of\r\nhis juvenile adventures; such as a rigorous magistrate might have turned\r\nto a very different account.[208] By what construction of equity the\r\npoor man's son, or the orphan, could deserve to be branded with an\r\nindelible stigma for no heavier crimes, it would be in vain to ask.\r\nInfractions of the law cannot be tolerated in any age, yet its\r\nadministration has been often both partial and unmerciful.\r\n\r\nMost of these young convicts had been first imprisoned a short period,\r\nand then turned on the world to obtain, by greater crimes, more lasting\r\nprotection; or sometimes accused, but not convicted, they waited amidst\r\nmoral pestilence the long delays of justice. A lad, fourteen years of\r\nage, was charged with stealing a hat: twelve months after, he was\r\nacquitted. What wonder that, dismissed a hardened criminal, he returned\r\nto be transported for life.[209] Such was the education of many, who\r\nmight fairly adopt the language of Howard to the German emperor--\"It is\r\nnot in the power of your majesty to make reparation for the injury they\r\nhave suffered.\" No subsequent care could atone for the long slumber of\r\nprotective justice.\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to find that kindness and coercion were united in the\r\ndiscipline of Point Puer: an oasis in the desert of penal\r\ngovernment--unless viewed from the woolsack. Captain Booth was prompt in\r\nsubduing rebellion and enforcing industry: the meals were regular, and\r\nhabits of devotion and cleanliness were promoted. But when the boys were\r\nsubmissive and diligent, they were not forbidden to be happy: they were\r\nmade tailors, shoemakers, carpenters, boat-builders, masons, and\r\ngardeners. Some became acceptable apprentices, were lost sight of as\r\nprisoners, and are now known only as respectable men. Such boys,\r\nhowever, were protected from contamination, from the moment of\r\nconviction. Those who mingled indiscriminately with the prisoners,\r\nsurpassed them in mischief and wickedness. When landed they were placed\r\nin the barracks: some, not more than ten years old, blended the trickery\r\nof boyhood with the villainy of age, and had scarcely arrived a week,\r\nbefore they were tied up to the triangles and punished with the cat.\r\nLord John Russell, yielding to humane suggestions, collected a\r\ncargo of juveniles from the various prisons, and appointed a\r\nsurgeon-superintendent, who never lost sight of their moral welfare. The\r\ncare was not unavailing: Captain Booth reported that a large proportion\r\npassed through his hands without incurring even magisterial correction,\r\nnotwithstanding the most trivial disorders were punished. The\r\nreformation of adults may admit of scepticism, and be tolerated as a\r\ntopic of ridicule: but children, taught to steal earlier than to speak;\r\nwho received the first lessons of crime on the lap of a mother; who\r\nnever heard of God, but from the lips of blasphemers--or of right, but\r\nas the fair distribution of spoil, were surely entitled to compassion.\r\nThe sympathies of man cast penal science to the winds, and scorn to\r\npreserve the inexorable temper of legal vengeance, to save the rich from\r\npeculation, by the moral immolation of infant robbers. They are orphans\r\ncast upon a nation's mercy; for though nature gave them the claims of\r\nchildren, she did not secure them an interest in a parent's heart.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: Collins.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: _Mudie's Felonry of New South Wales_, p. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: Savary wrote a novel, called _Quintus Servington_, 3\r\nvols.

Once, when assailed upon\r\nthe road, he clenched the robber by the throat, until he expired. He\r\nfound a pleasure in hastening the operations entrusted to his oversight,\r\nand neglect of work was an offence which was never pardoned. It did not\r\nunfrequently happen, that a tailor, or other sedentary craftsman, was\r\nsentenced to the roads; but in breaking stones, there is an art, and\r\nwhile the dexterous could make every blow effective, the utmost toil of\r\nthe novice left a deficiency in the task. To admit excuse, would have\r\ndisturbed the calculations of labor, and the defaulter was delivered at\r\nonce to the flogger; often, too, the implements, injured by use,\r\nrendered the fracture of stones more difficult: the issue of rations\r\nweekly, tempted the improvident to consume their food, so that the last\r\ndays of the week were spent in exhaustion and hunger.[211] The slightest\r\nsymptoms of insubordination were promptly visited; and in one party,\r\n3,300 lashes were administered in one morning.\r\n\r\nThe overseers copied the rigour of their superiors, without their\r\ndiscrimination or sense of justice. It was not uncommon, though\r\nforbidden, for these men to strike down the prisoners who displeased\r\nthem. Such violations of rule were punished when discovered: but men of\r\nweak minds bore in silence miseries they were afraid to resent. The\r\ngovernment compelled to accept such agents as transportation yielded,\r\nemployed persons of the vilest character, of which the following may be\r\ntaken as a specimen: W. A----, a prisoner for life, forfeited his\r\nticket-of-leave for keeping a house of ill-fame, and harbouring assigned\r\nservants. He applied for its restoration: this was opposed by the police\r\nmagistrate, who recommended that he should serve as an overseer for\r\nthree months on probation, as he had been notorious for keeping a bad\r\nhouse![212] The incongruity of this employment with his character must\r\nhave suggested itself to all except those familiar with similar\r\nappointments. Such as could command a bribe ameliorated their condition,\r\nwhile those who possessed no such resources, were selected to illustrate\r\nthe vigilance and fidelity of the overseers. It requires no extensive\r\nacquaintance with mankind to perceive, that in such hands public justice\r\nwas desecrated, and the weight of a sentence determined by causes which\r\nhad no relation to the character or the crime.\r\n\r\nThe orders of Stanley were constantly criticised by the press, and from\r\nvarious motives were disliked by every section of the public. All who\r\nhad been prisoners, naturally sympathised with the sufferers: those who\r\nwere employers, reprobated a form of punishment which, without\r\ndiminishing the application of the lash, abstracted from their farms a\r\nproportion of labour. A spirit of resistance was extensively propagated,\r\nand during the year following many sad instances occurred, in which an\r\ninsurgent spirit was fatal. A young man, when employed on the public\r\nworks, struck at Mr. Franks with his hammer: fortunately, the blow fell\r\nlightly; but he was tried and executed. A considerable number threw down\r\ntheir tools and retired to the bush, whither they were pursued and\r\nretaken. One instance made a powerful impression on the public mind: a\r\nconvict, named Greenwood, took from a fellow prisoner his shovel, which\r\nwas better than his own. He was sent at once by the superintendent to\r\nthe cells in charge of a fellow workman. In the spirit of reckless\r\ndaring, he told his conductor that he could run away if he thought\r\nproper; the other replied--\"no doubt of it.\" Thus, by a sudden impulse,\r\nin bravado or in terror of the lash, he sprang across the boundary, and\r\nthrew up his hat as a signal of his flight. He appeared on the race\r\nground, and was there discovered by the constables committing some act\r\nof petty robbery: he was pursued, drew a knife from his pocket, and\r\nwounded his captor. Being taken before a magistrate, both his absconding\r\nand his resistance were stated--the last a capital offence. To punish\r\nthis man was, of course, the duty of those whose authority he had\r\ndefied. As an absconder, he was sentenced to one hundred lashes, and\r\ntold--in words the import of which has not been disputed, although the\r\ntaunting tone attributed to the justice may possibly admit a\r\nquestion--that after his flogging he would be hanged! Ten days after, he\r\nwas condemned to death: his execution was delayed a few more by a\r\nrespite; but he went to the scaffold with his wounds unhealed! The\r\ntreatment of this man called forth, and justified the strongest\r\nexpressions of public indignation. True, it was within the letter of the\r\nlaw: either of the penalties inflicted, might have been vindicated or\r\nexcused both by necessity and custom; but to torture a fellow creature\r\nshortly to make his defence against a charge affecting his life, and to\r\nsend him to his last account whilst suffering the pangs of laceration,\r\nwas inexpressibly revolting. Those who desired to disgrace the\r\ngovernment, embraced the opportunity--perhaps with the eagerness of\r\nfaction: pictures were exhibited of the unfortunate man, illustrative of\r\nhis melancholy fate. Surely no argument can be found, in the calmest\r\nexercise of the understanding to extenuate an administration of the law,\r\nwhich distorted justice into cruelty.\r\n\r\nUnder circumstances far more consonant with reason, but scarcely less\r\naffecting when considered at large, was the execution of Samuel, a black\r\nman: he was transported for theft, from the Cape of Good Hope, and was\r\nremarkable for the quiet easiness of his disposition. For some violation\r\nof penal discipline he was ordered to be flogged: when approaching the\r\ntriangle, he attacked one of the officers in attendance, who was\r\nslightly wounded; for this he forfeited his life--justly, had England\r\nbeen just; but what was his story? With his mother and sister he was\r\nstolen from Mozambique, and thus became a slave: he robbed his masters,\r\nand thus became a criminal. His fate turns justice into mockery, and\r\nmight make the Briton blush for his country. His execution, however, was\r\nnot without utility: Dr. Ross, who for years had attended such scenes,\r\nthen adopted the conviction that no resources of language, or varieties\r\nof incident, could invest them with interest, and he resolved to attend\r\nthem no more. Here, too, the reader will be willing to abandon them.\r\nSince, they have often been repeated; but happily society has adopted\r\nfrom reflection, what that gentle-hearted man, so powerful is habit,\r\nrequired years to learn--that the executioner is an officer far less\r\nuseful, and the agent of a spirit far less just, than past ages have\r\ndeemed.[213]\r\n\r\nAt parting, it is proper to pay the tribute of history to the memory\r\nof Dogherty, the hangman--a functionary who surpassed greatly the\r\ncommon character of his order; and who, while he lived, contrived to\r\nevade the detestation of his calling. There was no amateur gaiety in his\r\nmanner--no harshness in his speech. He accepted office when a prisoner,\r\nto enjoy the quiet quarters of the gaol and liberation from ordinary\r\ntoil: he intended to resign it with his bondage, but the number of\r\ncandidates for his place, it is said, reconciled his mind to its\r\nretention. Not in the spirit of menace, but defensive retort, he would\r\npromise those by whom he was jeered, his most delicate attentions in\r\ntheir last emergency. He was always willing to part with his provisions:\r\nto divide his sugar and tea with the necessitous, and to perform errands\r\nof kindness in their favor. No one could wield the lash with more mercy;\r\nand it is said that once, an offender, sentenced to a public flogging,\r\nreceived one stroke at starting, and the cart being driven by an\r\nassociate, a second at stopping. His predecessor was a different\r\ncharacter; and overcome with the misery of his condition, he committed\r\nmurder, that he might escape from life! Dogherty passed through the town\r\nwithout fear of vengeance; although once, certain soldiers, his\r\ncountrymen, injured him, and left scars which he carried to the grave.\r\nBut what character is perfect? He was addicted to intemperance, and\r\ncommonly spent the day succeeding an execution in drunkenness. The\r\nincredulous are assured, that this is not the language of fiction, but\r\nthe character commonly ascribed in sober earnest to this unfortunate\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nThe day will come, when the sacrifice of life, made with more\r\nhesitation, will cease to be a public spectacle; when, if it is deemed\r\nrequisite to cut off from the earth the shedder of blood, the dreadful\r\ndoom will cease to amuse the brutal, or to offer a momentary excitement\r\nto the unreflecting. Women will be no longer seen raising their children\r\nabove the crowd, to enjoy the most humiliating sight that can meet the\r\neyes of mortals. Let no one imagine, that men are effectually\r\nintimidated by attending public executions: as the fatal moment draws\r\nnigh, crowds are indeed seen rushing towards the spot; but they wear the\r\nlineaments of insensibility, intemperance, or habitual crime. It is not\r\nthe guilt of the sufferer which extinguishes their pity: they would run\r\nto witness the murder of a saint. The utility of executions is left to\r\nthe judgment of statesmen, but it cannot be wrong to detest them.\r\n\r\nThus far having delineated the broad features of the system known as\r\nthe \"certain and severe,\" it will be proper to explain the changes which\r\nit ultimately produced in the practical working of transportation.\r\nSimultaneously, a new theory of colonisation was promulgated. Land\r\nceased to be granted: the funds accumulated by its sale were available\r\nfor emigration,--and thus to decrease the rate of wages, and to enable\r\nthe government to dispense with the services of convicts as writers,\r\noverseers, and mechanics. To assist this project, it had been determined\r\nto levy a tax on prison labor; but the protest of the colonists and the\r\nremonstrance of Arthur, led to its abandonment. The despatch which\r\nexplained his views, dwelt on the inconvenience, vexation, and loss, to\r\nwhich the settlers were subject. He informed the Secretary of State,\r\nthat his lordship could not understand, except by experience, how much\r\nand how often the colonists were fretted by the misconduct of their\r\nservants, and despoiled by their peculation: however perfect the\r\ndiscipline established; although the roads were safe, and violence\r\ninfrequent; though many prisoners were reformed and useful, still the\r\nexisting social state was charged with every form of domestic annoyance\r\nand mortification. Trivial thefts were constantly passed over, because\r\npunishment was attended with greater loss. Thus, two hundred men\r\narrive--they are distributed: their masters pay down money for their\r\nclothing; but before they reach their home, their clothes are destroyed\r\nor sold--or, perhaps, they are committed for felony to gaol. At first\r\nthe settler repines, but his difficulties are inevitable: he is silent,\r\nbecause his trials have long lost the interest of novelty, and all\r\naround him are fellow-sufferers. The settlers who submitted to the\r\nimpertinence and unwillingness of pickpockets, he thought certainly\r\nentitled to the benefit of their services without any other tax than\r\nmight be levied by their fingers. This earnest protest was not without\r\nsuccess; but it became, afterwards, a potent weapon in the hands of\r\nthose who pronounced transportation a failure.[214]\r\n\r\nThe arrival of many hundreds, whose previous habits were far from\r\nrespectable, increased the difficulties of penal government. The former\r\nmarked division of classes was confounded: the emigrant laborer was the\r\ncompanion of the prisoner of the crown; but, in law, the equal of the\r\nprisoner's master. This addition was greatly deplored, both by the\r\nGovernor and the press. It was perceived that great organic changes must\r\nfollow the influx of free men, whose interest would run in a direction\r\nentirely opposite to penal institutions. Thus, almost instantly, a\r\nchange became perceptible: the high value of prison labor was reduced,\r\nand employers hostile to the government could afford to defy its power.\r\nThe emigrant laborers formed an intermediate class, which detested the\r\nespionage and insolence of a convict constabulary, and was disposed to\r\nresent the haughty spirit which slavery has ever generated in the ruling\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, the feeling in opposition to transportation was strongly\r\nexpressed by certain portions of the people. A meeting was called, under\r\nthe auspices of Messrs. Kemp, Gellibrand, Hackett, Thomas Horne, and\r\nothers, which complained that the hope entertained, that the colony\r\nmight ultimately be freed from its penal character, had been\r\ndisappointed, and that the colonists \"were made materials for the\r\npunishment of British offenders;\" were considered only as the \"occupants\r\nof a large prison;\"--phrases of Arthur--and that \"this penal character\r\nhad recently increased; thus violating the feelings of the adult, and\r\nbarbarising the habits and demoralising the principles of the rising\r\ngeneration.\" This meeting, at which the sheriff presided, called by\r\npublic advertisement, was perhaps _de jure_ a meeting of the colony; but\r\nthe sheriff refused to attach his signature, lest the petition should be\r\ntaken as that of the settlers in general, whose opinions it certainly\r\ndid not then represent.\r\n\r\nArthur, in his despatch, endeavoured to neutralise its possible\r\ninfluence, at the same time intimating that he had \"long foreseen that\r\nabolition would become a popular question.\" He, however, maintained that\r\nthe emigrant, knowing the object of the settlement, had no right to\r\ncomplain; and that for the quarter of a century succeeding it would\r\nbecome increasingly adapted for the enforcement of penal discipline. He\r\nadvised the ministers to stop the current of emigration, which, if\r\ncontinued, would render \"convicts less valuable to the settlers,\" or to\r\nconfine it to female emigrants, or such artificers as carpenters and\r\nmasons.[215] Two hundred and sixty persons, in the Launceston district,\r\nrepudiated the following passage of the petition:--\"Your Majesty's\r\nhumble petitioners most respectfully pray your Majesty to be pleased in\r\nyour paternal goodness to remove from the colony of Van Diemen's Land\r\nthe degradation and unspeakable evils to which it is subject on account\r\nof its penal character.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be amusing to contrast the sentiments expressed by various\r\npersons during the first formal agitation of this subject, with\r\nthose that have latterly prevailed. It must, however, be remembered,\r\nthat there were two political parties. Some opposed transportation\r\nas the last indignity which could be offered to Arthur, its zealous\r\npatron; while others desired its continuance only because no other\r\nlabor was at hand. The paupers sent from the parishes did not create\r\na strong feeling of preference for free servants, many of whom\r\nwere profligate, intemperate, and otherwise worthless. Nor is it honest\r\nto conceal the disastrous influence of power on the moral perceptions of\r\nthe mind. It is justly observed by Franklin, the philosopher, that \"it\r\nis one of the worst features of human nature, yet one with which it is\r\ntoo generally impressed--the love of power; whereby all men prefer to be\r\nserved by slaves, over whom they have absolute dominion, than by free\r\nmen, who have rights as well as their masters.\" These motives, mingled\r\nand corroborated by the practice of many years, contributed to\r\nstrengthen the views of the local government, and to reduce to a small\r\nminority the advocates of abolition. Yet such are the singular\r\nconjunctions of affairs: though derided and rejected on the spot, they\r\nwere afterwards quoted with respect by a committee of British\r\nlegislators, when the subject of transportation again engaged the\r\nattention of parliament.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210:\r\n\r\n\"_Colonial Secretary's Office, 14th February_, 1833.\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty's government having been pleased to enjoin the strictest\r\nfulfilment of the law upon all convicts sent to this colony, and that\r\ntheir punishment should be _certain and severe_, the Lieutenant-Governor\r\ndirects the renewed attention of all public officers connected with the\r\nconvict department, to the instructions which have from time to time\r\nbeen issued on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency is desirous especially to impress upon them the\r\nnecessity of invariably exacting the due portion of daily labor from\r\neach convict, and of not permitting any remission or indulgence but such\r\nas have been previously and especially authorised.\r\n\r\n\"The orders prohibiting convicts employed on the roads and in the public\r\nworks (including clerks, messengers, and persons of that description)\r\nfrom laboring, under any pretence, for private individuals, or to the\r\nadvantage of those in charge of them, are at all times to be most\r\nperseveringly and carefully enforced, and to avoid any misconception in\r\na matter deemed so important by his Majesty's government, the\r\ninstructions are to be understood most peremptorily to forbid every\r\nspecies of indulgence beyond the food, clothing, bedding, and lodging\r\nauthorised by regulations to every convict.\r\n\r\n\"A proportionate degree of restraint and watchfulness over all assigned\r\nconvicts is equally essential.

D. Land Annual_; edited by Dr. Ross, 1833.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: 28th June, 1832.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: Despatch to Spring Rice.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVIII.\r\n\r\nGovernor Arthur held the reins of authority while considerable changes\r\ntranspired in the elder colony. Sir Thomas Brisbane, who succeeded\r\nMacquarie, had chiefly attempted to diminish the expenditure, and in the\r\nmanagement of convicts had sought in the results of their labor, rather\r\nthan its detail, the success of transportation. Formed into gangs, they\r\nwere employed in clearing farms under the inspection of government\r\nsuperintendents, for which the settlers paid a moderate price; but on\r\nthe arrival of General Darling, the government assumed an aspect of\r\nincreasing rigour, and the reins of authority were tightened until they\r\nwere in danger of breaking. It does not belong to this work to examine\r\nminutely the general policy of that ruler; it was, however, held in\r\nearnest detestation by those who were, or had been prisoners. The\r\nmagistrates were empowered to inflict corporal punishment to a very\r\nquestionable extent, and it was customary for one settler to judge and\r\nsentence the servant of another, who in his turn performed a similar\r\noffice. It is surely not necessary to prove, that the moderate exercise\r\nof such extensive powers depended rather on the equitable temper of\r\nBritish gentlemen than the practical limitation of their power.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of Sir Richard Bourke, the successor of Darling, the\r\nspirit of convict discipline underwent a change. By a new law he\r\nlessened the power of the magistrates to inflict corporal punishment,\r\nand particularly terminated the system of distributing through\r\nsuccessive days the sentence awarded. The magistrates complained that\r\nthe convict servants treated the penalties to which they were liable\r\nwith derision, and petitions from various districts of the colony\r\nclaimed the restoration of the abolished laws. This led to the issue of\r\nan order to the various district magistrates, requesting their personal\r\nattendance at the triangles, and a special report upon the extent of\r\nsuffering which resulted from the application of the lash.\r\nSuperintendent Ernest Augustus Slade, son of General Slade, prepared a\r\nscourge, which was called the \"regulation cat.\" Every flagellator\r\nthrough the colony was supplied with this instrument, and the effects it\r\nproduced are described with scientific minuteness. The last victim was\r\nmuch more fortunate than the first: the lash loosened, or softened, and\r\nbecame more merciful at every stroke.\r\n\r\nThe description of several hundred cases in the course of one month,\r\nprove how useless, how unequal, and unavailing this form of torture.\r\nSuch as these: \"a fair skinned young man, he bore his punishment well;\"\r\n\"he resolved to bear his punishment like a man;\" \"he begged for some\r\nwater;\" \"he seemed much exhausted, and cried like a child;\" \"this man\r\nnever moved or spoke;\" \"he seemed to suffer much mental pain;\" \"he bit\r\nhis lip, he had had former punishments;\" \"he neither cried nor spoke;\"\r\n\"he cried out domino.\" Of fifty, one half had never been flogged before.\r\nThen there follows in each case a description of the writhings of the\r\nsufferers: the discoloration of the skin, the time at which the blood\r\nappeared, and whatever might illustrate the power of the lash to degrade\r\nand torture. These returns were obtained to vindicate Governor Bourke\r\nfrom the charge of unseasonable lenity, and to prove that no just\r\ndiscontent was authorised by the mitigations he had enforced.\r\n\r\nA great portion of these punishments were inflicted by the order of Mr.\r\nSlade. Dismissed for immoralities he was authorised to avenge, he\r\nexcused them by alleging his youth. Though capricious, he was not cruel;\r\nbut it is due to mankind, to protest against depositing power in the\r\nhands of young persons, who have to cover their own passions by the plea\r\nof juvenility, and who, in every part of the penal colonies, have\r\nexhibited an example of those habits which lead to crime--and too often\r\nadministered public vengeance in the spirit of tyranny.\r\n\r\nCorporal punishment, long tenaciously vindicated, by those who ruled\r\nmasses of men, was held indispensible, and no severe reproach can be due\r\nto the government which authorised, or the magistrates who ordered, its\r\ninfliction. It seems, indeed, to be essential to every social system\r\nthat denies the ordinary rewards of labor. The rebel slave, to deprive\r\nhis master, will dare any suffering which suspends or terminates his\r\nservice. But beside those who employed the lash from conviction, there\r\nwere others of a different stamp: it is quietly observed by Messrs.\r\nBackhouse and Walker, that they found its greatest advocates \"among\r\npersons given to profane swearing.\" The violent temper, prone to break\r\nout in imprecations, would find another and congenial relief in scenes\r\nof torture and debasement. There were modes of punishment which no\r\nprejudice could extenuate: among these, the infliction of the lash in a\r\nform which degraded society more than it debased the sufferer. Thus, at\r\nHobart Town, men, for mere faults, have been sentenced to _exposure_ and\r\nthe scourge, in the view of hundreds: the flagellator extinguished the\r\nlast feeling of the man, and roused the temper of the demon. An old\r\ncompositor, within a month of his freedom, was charged with some\r\ntrifling breach of convict discipline, and though the father of grown up\r\nchildren, was ordered by a chief police magistrate, this cruel disgrace.\r\nHe is dead--and his oppressor is dead! Such cases were not uncommon, but\r\nthey are past, and they may be left to oblivion.\r\n\r\nWhether it is possible, in the present state of penal discipline, to\r\nwithdraw the scourge from the hands of authority, it might be difficult\r\nto decide: it should not, however, be forgotten, that its present\r\ncomparative disuse, was once pronounced impossible; and that when\r\nflogging decreased, crimes of savage violence became unusual.\r\n\r\nThe partisans of General Darling, many of whom were eminent, both for\r\ntheir opulence and social worth, resented the constructive censure of\r\nhis policy. They asserted that discipline was relaxed; that, under the\r\ntitle of the \"prisoners' friend,\" Bourke was an incendiary, stirring up\r\nthe laborers to rebellion.[216] They predicted that the diminished\r\nseverity of transportation as a penalty, would suggest new arguments\r\nagainst it in parliament, ultimately lead to its abolition, and thus\r\ninflict a fatal injury on the colony. The press, supported by\r\nemancipists, lauded the lenient temper of the governor, and exasperated\r\nthe advocates of the past system by allusions to their tyrannical rule,\r\nand exultation at their defeat. The old quarrel revived: the\r\ndissatisfied magistrates and settlers dwelt on the characteristic\r\ndepravity of the emancipists; and the necessity for their permanent\r\ndisqualification as jurors and electors. While they asserted the lasting\r\ncivil and moral distinctions between the voluntary and expiree settlers,\r\nthe patrons of the latter avenged them by maintaining that the convict\r\nwas only less _fortunate_ than his free employer, and that the moral\r\ndisparity assumed and vaunted, was rather fanciful than real.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of assigned servants in New South Wales had always been\r\nmore open to objection than Van Diemen's Land.[217] The transportation\r\nof 30,000, during ten years ending in 1836, produced the moral evils\r\ninseparable from such vast accumulations. Several of the settlers\r\nemployed from one to two hundred men, and it was a capital object to\r\nreduce them to the feeling, while they were subject to the economy of\r\npenal slavery. There were, indeed, many mitigations and many exceptions;\r\nbut the settlers at large realised less the healthy sympathy between the\r\nmaster and servant than was common in this country.\r\n\r\nA class of settlers, whose management was not less exceptionable,\r\nchiefly expirees, surrounded the large estates; thus, while some\r\nconvicts were considered both as criminals and slaves, others sat at the\r\ntable and enjoyed the company of their masters. The results of these\r\nextremes have been already described, and are always uniform.\r\n\r\nAmong those who resented the policy of Bourke, Major Mudie was the most\r\nbitter and persevering. In his \"_Felonry of New South Wales_,\" he\r\nemployed every epithet of horror and contempt in condemning the conduct\r\nof this governor. The character of Mudie, as delineated by his friends,\r\nis not repulsive: they have described him as a good master and a just\r\nmagistrate; but the style of his work awakens a suspicion that his\r\ntemper was not fitted for the control of his fallen countrymen. They\r\nwere sent to New South Wales to be punished: such was his theory.\r\nMacarthur, who participated in many of his sentiments, yet describes his\r\nown plan as the reverse. He knew that a severe gaoler could not be\r\nesteemed as a good master: \"he endeavoured to make his farm servants\r\nforget that they were convicts.\"[218] Mudie spoke of those he employed\r\nin the tone of an executioner--nothing could wash away their guilt, or\r\nobliterate its brand. His descriptions of the \"felonry\"--a cutting term\r\ndevised by himself, are grotesque and amusing. He deserves the fame of a\r\nsatirist, but on historical questions his vehement language impairs the\r\nforce of his testimony, and lessens the weight of his opinions.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was the proprietor of Castle Forbes, an estate of large\r\nextent, where many convicts were employed. Their immediate\r\nsuperintendence he intrusted to his nephew, of whom their complaints\r\nwere bitter and mutinous. Their remonstrances were punished: one man set\r\nout for Sydney, and carried a petition to Governor Bourke; he was sent\r\nback with a note to his master, written by the private secretary, who\r\ninterceded in his behalf; but his application was irregular, and his\r\nabsence unauthorised, and Mudie delivered him to the magistrate, by whom\r\nhe was flogged and condemned to chains. On this, several men rose in\r\nrebellion: they attacked the house of their master, robbed him of some\r\nrace horses, and attempted the life of the overseer. At their trial, and\r\njust before their death, they implored the governor to stop the\r\ncruelties which had driven them to desperation and the scaffold.\r\n\r\nDeferring to the strong feeling excited by their appeal, Bourke\r\nappointed an enquiry. The evidence collected did not sustain the charges\r\nof the men, who probably mistook their position, and exaggerated their\r\ngrievances; but their accusations made a deep impression on a certain\r\nclass, and the tyranny of the settler magistrates, of whom thirty were\r\ndismissed from the commission, was denounced with increasing boldness\r\nand asperity.\r\n\r\nAmong the most effective writers of the time, was William Angus Watt,\r\nwho held up the angry magistrates to derision, and their partisans, \"as\r\na faction dwindled to a shadow--\r\n\r\n    A mumping phantom of incarnate spite;\r\n    Loathed, but not feared, for rage that cannot bite.\"[219]\r\n\r\nThe career of this man is a curiosity of Australasian literature. Both\r\nDr. Lang and Major Mudie have spread his fame by their works and their\r\nparliamentary evidence. He committed a crime in Scotland, for which he\r\nwas outlawed; for a second, in London, he was transported. At Wellington\r\nValley he won the favor of his superintendent employed in an office at\r\nSydney, he conciliated the good-will of Bishop Broughton and several\r\nother clergymen, who interceded for his pardon. This was refused, but he\r\nobtained a ticket-of-leave, and engaged in the service of the editor of\r\nthe _Gazette_, the reputed organ of the government. The profligacy of\r\nhis habits, and the insolence of his writings, exposed him to\r\nobservation. He lived with a female illegally at large, whose child,\r\nborn in the factory, was baptised in his name. To involve the editors of\r\nthe _Herald_ in a prosecution for libel, Watt procured, by the agency of\r\na printer in their office, a slip proof of a letter they had resolved to\r\nsuppress. This he transmitted through the post to the person\r\ncalumniated, to give him the necessary evidence of publication. For his\r\nshare in this scandalous trick he was tried, but the paper stolen was of\r\nso little value that he was acquitted. In addressing the jury, he\r\npointed out Major Mudie as his unrelenting persecutor, and as an\r\noppressor of unfortunate prisoners. Mudie, to punish the alleged\r\ninsolence of his defence, accused him of immorality and habitual lying,\r\nand demanded the revocation of his ticket-of-leave. The investigation\r\nlasted several weeks, and ended in the dismissal of the charge, which\r\nwas not unfairly attributed to the animosities kindled by newspaper\r\nwarfare, in which Mudie was more than a spectator. Judge Burton\r\nrepresented that the residence of Watt in Sydney was pernicious, and\r\nGovernor Bourke ordered him to the district of Port Macquarie; whither\r\nhe was followed by the proprietress of the _Gazette_, with whom he\r\nmarried, by the governor's permission. There he was again concerned in\r\nan official dispute: his ticket was withdrawn; he absconded, was retaken\r\nand flogged--and thus dropped down to the degraded condition which his\r\nenemies desired, and which was certainly not undeserved.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to identify Bourke with this man was an artifice of faction.\r\nThe license he received was not unusual, and his previous character had\r\nbeen free from colonial offence. His influence resulted from his\r\nability: his principles were the current notions of the emancipists; nor\r\nis it easy to discern how talents, such as he was supposed to possess,\r\ncould be prevented from finding their level.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Dr. Lang established the _Observer_. Its object was to\r\nwrite down the emancipist partisans, and the journals subject to their\r\npower. The good service performed by this earnest censor was not without\r\nalloy: and in his attacks on their moral reputation, he seemed sometimes\r\nto write what they themselves might have written. The emancipists were\r\ndrawn together by common sympathies: they charged the free settlers with\r\nattempting to exact from the sufferings and failings of their brethren,\r\na consideration in the colony, to which they were entitled neither by\r\ntheir rank nor their reputation. Nor was this reflection always without\r\nreason: in strange forgetfulness of the natural operation of self-love,\r\nthe upper classes of New South Wales expected multitudes, often of\r\ngreater wealth than themselves, to walk humbly in their presence. Such\r\nclaims the emancipists met with defiance. The false morality of their\r\njournals will be largely ascribed by a calm enquirer to retaliation and\r\nhatred, rather than to a judgment corrupted--in reference to the real\r\nnature of crime.[220]\r\n\r\nNothing so powerfully contributed to rouse the attention of the empire,\r\nas the charge of Judge Burton, delivered to the petty jurors, at the\r\nclose of the criminal court, 1835. Perhaps a more awful picture was\r\nnever drawn, or a more serious impeachment pronounced against a people.\r\nThis celebrated speech furnished the text of examination, when\r\nparliament once more enquired on the subject. Judge Burton asserted\r\nthat the whole community seemed engaged in the commission or the\r\npunishment of crimes. Crimes, including 442 capital convictions in three\r\nyears: crimes of violence, murders, manslaughters in drunken\r\nrevels--deliberate perjuries, from motives of revenge or reward, were\r\nbrought to light. He complained of the deficiency of religious\r\nprinciple: of the neglect and profanation of the sabbath: on which day\r\nthe worst actions were planned and perpetrated. The convict stations he\r\ncompared to \"bee-hives, diligently pouring in and out; but with this\r\ndifference--the one worked by day, the other by night: the one goes\r\nforth to industry, the other to plunder.\" These evils he traced to\r\n\"squatting;\" the congregation of prisoner servants in Sydney; the\r\nlicense of improper persons to public houses; and, more than all, the\r\ntotal neglect of superintendence by employers of convicts, who, armed\r\nfor marauding expeditions, sometimes left their masters' premises by\r\nnight, and even by day. He closed, by declaring his love to free\r\ninstitutions--the pride, indeed, and boast of England; but which, if\r\nconferred on such a populace, he believed would end in the corruption of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThat this address gave a true description of a part of the population,\r\ncannot be doubted; but inferences were liable to error, even on the\r\nspot, much more when drawn at a distance. A mass of thieves under any\r\nsystem, if in contact with property, must produce a mass of crime; yet\r\neven in the worst days of transportation, the relapses were\r\nproportionately less than under any other system of prison discipline.\r\nIn England, 30,000 such persons at large, would yield annually at least\r\nan equal number of felonies.\r\n\r\nThe abuses which were brought to light, were certainly flagrant: the\r\nmost memorable was the instance of Nash, who took to Sydney the rich\r\nspoil of a robbery, and set up a large drapery warehouse; and of Gough,\r\nan assigned servant of the chief justice, who lived at large, and\r\ncarried on a quiet business as a receiver of stolen goods. Cases so\r\nconspicuous strongly illustrated the evils of assignment. The miserable\r\nfate of Mudie's men, compared with the condition of such persons,\r\nnaturally suggested the idea, that some new change was essential, to\r\nprotect from reproach or derision the public justice of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of a committee to promote emigration from Ireland, of\r\nwhich Archbishop Whately was chairman, called attention to the subject\r\nof transportation. It was the opinion of the committee (1836), that to\r\nsend the peasantry of Ireland to a community so polluted, was base,\r\ncruel, and impolitic. The right reverend prelate asserted that statesmen\r\nwere tolerating a social organisation, destined one day to involve the\r\nempire in deep disgrace, and exhibit the awful spectacle of a nation of\r\ncriminals!\r\n\r\nThe desire to possess free institutions, brought the question of\r\ntransportation to a crisis. The patriotic association advocated an\r\nunrestricted concession of political rights; the anti-emancipists a\r\nlimitation of the franchise to such as were always free. This division\r\nof opinion was characterised by the usual warmth of political faction,\r\naggravated by personal anger. The petition of the exclusionists called\r\nthe attention of parliament to the state of the convict question, and\r\nsolicited enquiry.[221] Macarthur, whose work is a commentary on the\r\npetition, full of valuable information, suggested the abolition of\r\nassignment, the separation of the convict department and colonial\r\ngovernment, and the establishment of large gangs, in which labor might\r\nbe exacted, without partiality.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of this important question during the last years of\r\nArthur's administration. When he deemed the details of his penal system\r\nnearest perfection, the main principles on which it rested were\r\nundermined. The severity enjoined by Lord Stanley, and the lenity\r\nexercised by General Bourke, raised an outcry against transportation;\r\nand once more propagated the idea that in its lenity it was corrupt, and\r\nits severity cruel. A running fire was kept up by the press, which\r\nreturned to the question of secondary punishments with new vigour, and\r\nrepeated all the problems on this perplexing subject--perhaps, destined\r\nto confound the wise, and furnish a theme for dogmatism through all\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn 1837, the House of Commons appointed the committee, of which Sir\r\nWilliam Molesworth was chairman.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: _Mudie's Felonry._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: \"I thought them a villanous shabby set, compared with\r\nconvicts in Van Diemen's Land.\" \"There appeared a great deal of\r\nflogging.\" \"My men did twice as much work.\" \"I told my brother, if he\r\nused his men as we did, he would get more work: he said _it would be\r\nill-received through the country_.

And yet the\r\ndisappearance of emancipist disqualifications has almost banished a\r\nclass of writers who were accepted as champions, but who could not\r\nseriously affect the ultimate views of public and private morality--they\r\nwere mere actors.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIX.\r\n\r\nWhile these questions were agitated in England, Sir John Franklin\r\nreceived the government of Tasmania. Captain Maconochie, already known\r\nto scientific men, and who had enjoyed long the friendship of the\r\nGovernor, accepted the office of private secretary--a situation of not\r\nmuch emolument, but highly confidential. When his destination became\r\npublic, the society for the improvement of prison discipline requested\r\nhim to examine closely the results of transportation, as exhibited in\r\nVan Diemen's Land. To assist his inquiries, they prepared sixty-seven\r\nquestions, comprehending the details of convict management, on which\r\nthey desired a minute exposition of his views; and added, \"_make such\r\ngeneral remarks as occur on the whole convict system of the colony, and\r\nits effects on the moral and social state of the community: also remark\r\non the effect of the latter, and enter on the subject largely, making\r\nany observation which may be useful in regard thereto_.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Maconochie referred the application to Sir George Grey, who\r\nconsented, conditionally:--that all papers on the subject should pass\r\nthrough the usual channel to the colonial-office, and be first placed at\r\nhis absolute disposal. The effects of this commission were momentous.\r\nMaconochie, when he left Great Britain, professed a freedom from decided\r\nbias, and to favor the general system of Arthur, rather than that\r\npropounded by Archbishop Whately. The opinions he ultimately adopted, he\r\nascribed to his own observation, and disclaimed all prejudice against\r\nthose forms of prison discipline he was destined to subvert.\r\n\r\nThe discussions thus originated are of a deeply interesting character,\r\nand their influence will long survive the animosity they occasioned. The\r\ncompletion of Maconochie's report was exceedingly rapid, or it was very\r\nearly commenced. He had resided but three months, when he felt\r\nauthorised to pronounce the existing system of management defective, far\r\nless in application than in principle. The course ascribed to Maconochie\r\nwas that of a prejudiced spy, seeking evidence for a case pre-judged:\r\nthat which he claimed, was the task of a philosopher, scanning facts\r\npatent to every eye--even more striking when first seen. His conclusions\r\nhe attributed to the inevitable process by which facts are generalised,\r\nand demonstrate systems. His style, when deliberate, is terse and\r\nexplicit: his ideas he expressed with the utmost freedom; or, as it then\r\nseemed, audacity. The colonists he treated as an operator, who indeed\r\npities the sufferings of his patient, but disregards a natural outcry,\r\nwhile expounding in the language of science both the symptoms and the\r\ncure. Without circumlocution or reserve, he spoke of the officers\r\nconcerned in convict management as blinded by habit--as empirics who\r\ncould patch and cauterise a wound, but were involved in the hopeless\r\nprejudices of a topical practice, and much too far gone to comprehend\r\nimprovements founded on scientific principles. His deviations from the\r\ntone of philosophical discussion were not numerous, but they were\r\nmarked. The chief police magistrate he compared to the lamplighter, by\r\nwhom gas is detested. In praising that officer's administrative talent,\r\nhe observed that he belonged to the martinet school, and that his\r\nestimate of human nature depressed it below its worth.\r\n\r\nThe representations of Maconochie, with reference to the condition of\r\nthe convicts and the character of the settlers, awakened a storm of\r\nindignation. Transportation, he said, at a distance appeared a trivial\r\npenalty; but when surveyed more nearly, it was found to be inhuman. The\r\nservant was assigned to a master without his consent; his employment was\r\nalien to his habits; he labored without wages; he was met with\r\nsuspicion, and ruled with insult or contempt. The servant became sullen,\r\nthe settler vindictive: slight offences were visited with punishments\r\n\"severe, to excessive cruelty,\"--offences, often the ebullitions of\r\nwounded feeling, and the tokens of a hopeless wretchedness.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, this condition--unknown to the population at\r\nhome--afforded no warning. The victims were uncompensated--the great\r\nmajority unreformed. Thus, employers preferred new hands to those passed\r\nthrough this discipline of suffering. Such as rose in society, were\r\nseldom really respectable; they neither regretted their crimes, nor\r\noffered atonement. But if the prisoner was injured, the colonist was not\r\nless so. Social virtues were discouraged; all classes were contentious\r\nand overbearing: the police, ever prying into the business of life, thus\r\nintermixed with penal systems, filled the colony with exasperation, from\r\nwhich not even the mildest spirits could escape. He did not propose to\r\nabolish transportation, but that the government by its own officers\r\nshould both punish and reform; that the prisoners, when restored to\r\nsociety, should stand in the relations of free men to all except the\r\ncrown, receiving wages at the current rate; and if restrained in their\r\nexpenditure, not for punishment, but for safety--\"the chains of paternal\r\nauthority\" thrown over them, \"to protect them against themselves.\"\r\n\r\nMaconochie sent to Sir G. Grey a Summary of his Report, containing his\r\nopinions of existing systems: at his request it was at once handed to\r\nLord John Russell, who again, conveyed it to the committee then sitting\r\nupon the subject of transportation. Although substantially agreeing with\r\nhis report, _the summary_ condensed, and therefore rendered more\r\nflagrant, the charges against the colonists, and his description of the\r\ncondition of the prisoners still more revolting.\r\n\r\nThis _Summary_ appeared in an English newspaper. Hitherto the discussion\r\nhad been confined to official circles or to select correspondence: it\r\nwas now open to the world; and the colonists found, with astonishment,\r\nthat the reform proposed was radical, and that the opinions of the\r\nreformer were wholly adverse to the existing systems.\r\n\r\nIn this summary, the condition of the convicts was depicted with all the\r\ncoloring of misery: they were slaves, subject to coercion; strangers to\r\nmoral impulses, save only the distant hope of liberty. They were lodged\r\nin huts with stable roofs, damp floors, and rude furniture.[222] They\r\nslept on truckle bedsteads, often undressed; their food was cooked in\r\nthe roughest manner; without wages, they robbed; miserable, they were\r\ndrunken. Their better qualities were unregistered: the artful escaped,\r\nwhile the \"careless fellow,\" otherwise good, was involved in a long\r\ntrain of penalties. A ticket obtained, the holder could acquire no\r\nproperty, and was worried by police interference; and in one night his\r\nindulgence might be forfeited. Though some masters, generous or weak,\r\nsoftened its rigour, assignment as a punishment, generally exceeded the\r\ndesert of minor offences: and its degradation, unfelt by old offenders,\r\nwas agony to men of minds more sensitive. The bad were little punished,\r\nthe good demoralised; self respect was destroyed; and men born to better\r\nthings, sacrificed by political institutions, rather than by their\r\npersonal depravity or their crimes. This state was worse than negro\r\nslavery: the interests of the masters were less permanent; who, though\r\nthey did not fear their servants, disliked, coerced, and inveighed\r\nagainst them. This slavery tainted colonial life: the colonists were\r\nharsh and overbearing at home; they were quarrelsome neighbours, given\r\nto reckless assertion; rapacious, envious, and disaffected. Government\r\nwas unpopular, and all governors so in succession. The police, if not\r\ncorrupt, was irksome and intrusive. Labor was wasted, emigration\r\ndiscouraged. Crime and drunkenness multiplied, and what a hundred and\r\nfifty is to one thousand, or thirteen hundred, such was the crime of\r\nVan Diemen's Land to that of England and Scotland. Drunkenness had\r\nrisen, in ten years, from three per cent. to fourteen per cent.: in\r\nLondon, such was the difference of tendencies between those meridians,\r\nit was reduced to an imperceptible fraction.\r\n\r\nTo remedy these evils, he demanded the abolition of domestic slavery: a\r\nseparation, distinct as their natures, between punishment and moral\r\ntraining; punishment, certain and appropriate--inflicted upon system,\r\nand in seclusion; and training, not less systematic, but social and\r\nprobationary--coercion being banished, moral influence alone applied.\r\nFor punishment, Maconochie deemed the system of Port Arthur,\r\nadministered by Booth, an admirable model. For training, he suggested\r\nstations within reach of the free community, where the convicts should\r\nbe prepared for society in parties of six, joined in a common fate, by\r\nmutual agreement. They were to work out their redemption together: their\r\nvigilance would detect, their interests depress disorders in the clubs;\r\nthe virtues of sobriety, diligence, decency, and industry, achieved by\r\neach, would be rewarded for the common benefit of all; but for the fault\r\nof one, the whole would pay the penalty; or should the partnership be\r\ndissolved by the intolerable injustice of any, its disbanded members\r\nwould return to their starting point, and in new combinations pursue\r\nagain, and perhaps again, the first steps, until all should reach\r\nabreast one common goal.\r\n\r\nSuch was the system of moral training and mutual responsibility, which\r\nhe deemed only a new accommodation of established principles. In his\r\nview, it was a moral field the greatest statesman might enter with\r\nsuccess, and thus crown himself with immortal renown. Such in substance\r\nwas the summary, afterwards amplified by details and illustrated by\r\nfacts. In subsequent papers the more offensive passages were explained\r\nand qualified; but at best, they appear not only an indictment of\r\nopinions and systems, but of classes and communities.\r\n\r\nSir John Franklin promptly referred the queries of the _Society_ to an\r\nofficial board, which consisted of the chief police magistrate of the\r\nterritory (Captain Forster), the director-general of public works\r\n(Captain Cheyne), and the superintendent of convicts (Mr. Spode). In\r\nreply to sixty-six of these questions they had only to refer to\r\nundisputed facts; but the last contemplated both the theory and\r\npractice of transportation. In the statement of facts they united; but\r\nthe proper remedies to apply to acknowledged evils, admitted of\r\ndifference--and they all differed.\r\n\r\nThe memorandum of the chief police magistrate, beside briefly describing\r\nthe practice of former times, recommended important changes for the\r\nfuture. Instead of assignment from the ships, he suggested that all\r\nprisoners should be placed on the public works, for a period to be fixed\r\nby the judges. He proposed a new distribution of time penalties: thus\r\ninstead of seven, fourteen years, and life, to recognise by law a more\r\nminute and proportionate sub-division. In assignment, he recommended\r\nwages, rateable at the discretion of government; afterwards a _first\r\nclass_ ticket-of-leave, with a permission to choose employers; and a\r\n_second class_, to include most of the privileges of freedom, voidable\r\nonly by a court of quarter sessions for specified offences. The\r\nconditional pardon he deemed it necessary to defer a longer time than\r\nusual; since, when released from surveillance and responsibility,\r\nticket-holders often relapsed into the vices from which they had\r\npreviously emerged.\r\n\r\nMr. Spode concurred with the chief police magistrate, though with\r\nserious reservations: especially, he deprecated any delay of\r\nassignment--a state he deemed most conducive to reform, and highly\r\nuseful to the colony. Mr. Forster had declared that female prisoners\r\n\"_were not available subjects for prison discipline_.\" Mr. Spode\r\nrecommended solitary confinement, or marriage. In the meantime,\r\nMaconochie having drawn up his report, submitted it to Captain Cheyne,\r\nand made a proselyte.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cheyne took the colony by surprise. Not only did he denounce\r\nassignment, but spoke of the settlers with still less tenderness: he\r\nasserted that a great proportion of those entrusted with convicts \"were\r\ndissolute in their habits, and depraved in their principles.\" That there\r\n\"existed a fearful degree of depravity, unparalleled in any age;\" that\r\nassignment was the great source of crime and caste: for the convict \"no\r\nman cared;\" few were exempt from contemptuous and brutal treatment--few\r\nescaped punishment. Such opinions could only usher in a system radically\r\nnew. Thus Captain Cheyne proposed to divide the prisoners into gangs of\r\ntwo hundred each, and the adoption of task work proportioned to physical\r\nstrength. He proposed wages to be paid to the road parties, to be\r\nexpended in the purchase of comforts, or reserved for a future day. On\r\nintroducing the prisoners into society, he recommended a graduated scale\r\nof indulgence, not greatly dissimilar from the propositions stated\r\nalready.\r\n\r\nThe papers of Maconochie and Cheyne were referred to the members of the\r\nexecutive council, and were generally condemned. Captain Montagu urged\r\nthe great danger to the public peace, from the propagation of an opinion\r\nthat the laws were unjust, the masters oppressive, and the government\r\ncruel. Were it intended to test Maconochie's theory, he demanded a large\r\nincrease of military force. He, however, complained that gentlemen, who\r\npossessed such slight practical knowledge, should venture to assail\r\nestablished systems. His remarks chiefly related to the colonial\r\ninfluence of their ideas, and he exaggerated the danger to the public\r\nsafety. The most dispassionate examination of this report was given by\r\nArchdeacon Hutchins. It was far more copious in its admissions in\r\nreference to the existing system. Little work was done; the prisoners\r\nwere very slightly reformed, and the agents often unfit. But by what\r\nmeans labor could be exacted, or a \"millennial age of righteousness\"\r\nsupersede the past, he declared himself uncertain. He was sceptical that\r\nit was possible to obtain men of science, prudence, and equity, to\r\nadminister a system so complexed, and requiring such discretion.\r\n\r\nMr. Gregory, the colonial treasurer, adopted a less grave form of\r\ncriticism. He soothed, by his humour, the colonial wrath, and among the\r\nlesser gods excited unextinguishable laughter. The charges of Maconochie\r\nand Cheyne against the colonists, he described as loose and random\r\nshots, fired by inexperienced hands. In reducing the plan of clubs to\r\npractical details, he insisted they were unequal, and even impossible.\r\nThe minute appraisement, both of good and evil; reckoning up the diurnal\r\nmerits of the men--the balance of which was to furnish their capital\r\nstock, to discharge their fines, to find them food and clothing, and\r\nliberty--he described as a gigantic scheme of finance.[223] He amused\r\nhimself by supposing the number of chances which might intervene before,\r\nof ninety-six men, the whole should be divided into clubs of six, and\r\nby the separate agreement of all combine their fortunes, and risk joint\r\nforfeitures: each man settling into partnership with five others whom he\r\ncould trust, and by whom he could be trusted. He figured also the\r\nembarrassment of the protectors, who every evening, ledger in hand, must\r\nmake up their debtor and creditor account for the three hundred\r\nprobationers.\r\n\r\nThe summary, Capt. Maconochie had enclosed, under seal of the Governor,\r\nto Sir George Grey, without however fully explaining its contents to Sir\r\nJohn Franklin, or intimating its serious and formal nature. When the\r\njournal containing it was placed in his hands, he uttered an exclamation\r\nof astonishment, and instantly dismissed its author, but did not\r\nwithdraw his friendship. Maconochie represented that it was a private\r\ndocument, intended for private use--its sudden appearance not less\r\nunexpected than embarrassing. That he had not submitted this paper to\r\nthe Governor, he ascribed to the irritation caused by the difference of\r\ntheir opinions; and that he did not delay its transmission, he imputed\r\nto its overwhelming importance and its pressure on his mind. How the\r\nspirit of the Governor was extolled by the colonists need not be\r\nformally stated, or how his discarded secretary was accused of rashness,\r\nperfidy, and falsehood. Maconochie did not himself disdain to\r\nacknowledge, that in error of judgment he had forwarded too early, and\r\nin a manner seemingly clandestine, a report so decided. The imputation\r\nof duplicity was unjust: Franklin was not wholly ignorant of the\r\ncontents of the packet. Although not, perhaps, aware that he was\r\nfranking a system, yet by the same vessel he wrote to the minister that\r\nhe had not read, and could not answer for the _summary_. It was,\r\nhowever, strange for the ministers of the crown to rely on a private\r\nreport; and especially upon the truthfulness of an analysis, which gave\r\nopinions, but deferred the evidence on which they were said to rest.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance which may be traced between the system propounded by\r\nMaconochie, and the suggestions which have been offered at various times\r\nby writers on this subject, will not deprive him of the credit of\r\noriginality. Hazarded by their authors without much reflection, the\r\nboldness of a reformer was required to adapt them. It may, however, be\r\ninteresting to trace the details which he combined, or the sources of\r\nthose ideas which he comprehended in his scheme.\r\n\r\nSidney Smith suggested \"new gradations of guilt to be established by\r\nlaw, and new names to those gradations; a different measure of good and\r\nevil treatment attached to those denominations--as rogues, incorrigible\r\nrogues,\" and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. Potter M'Queen recommended a division of offenders, some of whom\r\nshould be punished in gangs, and others subject to a process simply\r\nreformatory.\r\n\r\nBlanco White, a celebrated Spaniard, had suggested sentences to an\r\namount of work rather than to an extent of years. He proposed that the\r\ntread-wheel should measure the progress of the culprit, and that every\r\nrevolution should bring him nearer to liberty.\r\n\r\nHis punitive system had long been adopted by Arthur, though probably\r\nwith objects somewhat distinct: it was found in every penal settlement\r\nand road gang.\r\n\r\nCapt. Cheyne had recommended the opening of accounts and payment for\r\nprobationary labor.\r\n\r\nAt Bermuda, the stimulus of present enjoyment was offered to industry:\r\nconvicts were allowed 1_s._ 6_d._ per week, half of which they were at\r\nliberty to expend in fruits, vegetables, and such like comforts; the\r\nresidue forming a fund, sometimes of L15 and L20, receivable at\r\ndischarge. These indulgences were attended with the happiest effects,\r\nand the superintendent, Sir Thomas Usher, was so satisfied with their\r\nreformation, that he had no doubt seven-eighths were better men at the\r\nclose than at the commencement of their bondage.\r\n\r\nThe idea of clubs was found in the tithings of the ancient Britons,\r\nwhich were enrolled by the authority of Alfred, and made liable for each\r\nother. Maconochie saw in the disjointed and licentious condition of that\r\nera, something analogous to the state of convicts, and in the result\r\nthat \"a bracelet might be left on the highway with security,\" an\r\nencouragement to hope, from a similar organisation, for the same\r\nsuccess. Capt. Maconochie quoted Hume in describing these societies, but\r\nhe omitted those sentences which seem to give another aspect to the\r\ninstitution; for when a member of the tithings was charged with a crime,\r\nthe rest could purge themselves from responsibility, if acquitted on\r\noath of connivance with the offender, or his escape: but, however\r\ninnocent, the clubs of Maconochie were involved in the responsibility of\r\nthe transgressor--a fundamental difference, the suppression of which was\r\nscarcely compatible with literary candour.\r\n\r\nBentham himself had proposed that convicts should remain at auxiliary\r\nestablishments, in principle resembling the training stations of\r\nMaconochie, until they could be prepared for the full enjoyment of\r\nliberty. He also suggested mutual surveillance associations, in which\r\nthe prisoners should watch over, instruct, and assist each other.\r\nArchbishop Whately advocated the detention of prisoners until their\r\nreformation was established.\r\n\r\nMaconochie attributed his idea of marks to an observation of Messrs.\r\nBackhouse and Walker on their usefulness in training the rising\r\ngeneration: they thought they discerned a faint image of the club system\r\nat Macquarie Harbour, where devout prisoners separated themselves into a\r\nsociety, and were secured from the interruption of the rest. Men from\r\nbondage, were released in the hulks, when the sum total of marks in\r\ntheir favor covered a certain period of their sentence.\r\n\r\nMacarthur had recommended the employment of an officer, under the\r\nimmediate direction of the home secretary of state, responsible for the\r\nfull execution of a sentence, to whom the entire management of the\r\nconvict department might be committed. The governors would thus be less\r\nlikely to change the aspect of transportation, according to their\r\nparticular theories.[224]\r\n\r\nCaptain Maconochie was preceded in this branch of penal philosophy by a\r\ngentleman, not equally celebrated, but who proposed changes as radical.\r\nIt is amusing to observe, with what different objects, and how diverse\r\nin spirit, similar mutations have been enforced. Dr. Henderson, the\r\nfounder of the Van Diemen's Land Society, on returning to India, offered\r\nthrough the press at Calcutta a new scheme of colonisation, based on\r\nconvict government. That which existed he deemed defective in its main\r\nprinciples, and futile in its results. The settlers he described, with\r\nsome contempt, as an inferior class, inflated with notions of liberty\r\nand equality, and debased by convict associations; prone to quarrel and\r\nencroach, but distressed with the endless vexations of their lot.\r\nForbidden to punish the insolence of their servants; exposed to the\r\ndisgrace of meeting their accusations; or when they prosecuted a charge,\r\nliable to the strictures of the magistrate, who might penetrate the\r\nsecrets of their dwellings, and censure them in the presence of their\r\nexulting slaves. Thus, though the author assumed the tone of\r\nphilosophical discussion, he differed from others who professed to\r\ninvestigate principles: he observed--\"We find the convicts in the\r\ncondition of slaves placed under despotic power.\" \"It is not necessary\r\nto enquire whether it is for their benefit;\" \"they are not entitled to\r\nour sympathy, should they be treated with the rigour of slaves:\" \"they\r\nwill not often labor when they are removed from the dread of\r\npunishment.\" \"The magistrates should be relieved from forms and\r\nprecedents, and punish according to the intrinsic value of offences, and\r\nfor the public good.\" \"More injury is done by the trammels of the law,\r\nthan by leaving the judges to their own discretion.\" Such is the essence\r\nof his system, which, however, always presumed the existence of a lofty\r\npurpose and a dispassionate administration.[225] For this large\r\ndiscretion, however, he pronounced the existing settlers unfit: he\r\nrecommended the employment of young educated gentlemen, under a board of\r\ndirectors, and proposed as the primary object of discipline, neither\r\npunishment nor intimidation, but _productiveness_. Power being lodged in\r\nthe hands of the superintendents, without regard to _Burns' Justice_, or\r\nwritten regulations, they would check offences at once, and punish\r\naccording to their social and material tendency. He held, as vitally\r\nimportant, that all national views in reference to transportation should\r\nbe subordinate to the colonial welfare. Having formed agricultural\r\nestablishments, and fitted them to become the home of capitalists, the\r\nofficers of government would give place to another class of employers.\r\nThe house, the servants, and the cleared ground, would be disposed of by\r\nthe crown; the convicts, gradually trained, exalted into a free\r\npopulation, and with their families would form a peasantry. The sale of\r\nthese estates would repay the original outlay; and thus, without further\r\ndrafts on the treasury, the process could be renewed in an endless\r\nsuccession. The lash, Dr. Henderson was far from rejecting as an\r\ninstrument of correction--\"cheap and expeditious:\" in short, his was a\r\nplan of slavery, and which conveyed semi-magisterial powers to the\r\noverseers, and gave them a profit on the labor they might exact.\r\n\r\nHenderson had become sultanised by living in India: he was attached to\r\nthe spirit of its government; the legal formalities, which delight an\r\nEnglishman, seemed to him the degradation of rank, and a pernicious\r\nlicense to inferiors. In his imaginary commonwealth, he saw but two\r\nclasses, which, in the language of the East, he distinguished as the\r\n\"head and the hand.\" He thought the judges should be required to aid the\r\ngovernors by their interpretations of the law; who, at the close of\r\ntheir administration, might be tried by their peers, and, if found\r\nwanting, handed over to everlasting shame! Thus, his plan embodied the\r\nspirit of caste, of orientalism, and of the India House. He had no\r\nsimpering tenderness for the prisoner, while he attributed to the upper\r\nclasses an innate rectitude and self control, such as the British\r\nrecords of the East will hardly sustain. His speculations are worth\r\nremembering, for the contrast of their _animus_ with those of\r\nMaconochie, and for the analogy in their details.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: The petition to the Commons prayed an enquiry into the\r\nefficacy of transportation to New South Wales as a secondary punishment:\r\nwhether it should be continued, and under what alterations of the\r\npresent system; or, if discontinued, in what manner, &c.--_Petition_,\r\n1836.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: It was not much better in England: the Rev.

His description of the condition of the prisoners might be\r\neasily illustrated by examples. There were settlers, not a few, to whose\r\ncare the prisoners were entrusted, who were unfit to govern a kennel.\r\nLow in their origin, corrupt in their principles, and detestable in\r\ntheir lives--themselves differing from felons in nothing but their\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy prisoner entrusted to their charge, was insulted, coerced,\r\nand crushed. Sufficiently cunning to avoid a palpable infraction of the\r\norders of government, they constantly violated their spirit. Physical\r\nweakness, or mental incapacity, they treated as evasion or contempt.\r\nProne to invoke the interposition of the magistracy, they drove\r\nunfortunate beings for slight offences to a tribunal, where the\r\npresumption was always against them. In the presence of the magistrate\r\nthey were smooth and supple; but the eye of the punished prisoner marked\r\nthe exultation of cruelty triumphant, and his course was rapid from\r\nfailings to faults, and from faults to crimes.\r\n\r\nIn the larger establishments, except where the humanity of the master\r\nkept alive his vigilance, the men were sometimes placed in the power of\r\nan overseer, himself perhaps an expiree; who, elated with office,\r\ndelighted in the advent of his turn to torture. On such farms the rigour\r\nof discipline seemed essential to order: too often, the men differed but\r\nlittle from slaves. Violations of rule were deemed more pernicious by\r\ntheir example than their immediate inconvenience: to pass by a fault,\r\nwas thought to license its imitation. The indulgences afforded by a\r\nsmall settler, whose social happiness depended on their good humour,\r\nwould have proved, where many herded together, an item of large expense.\r\nPunishments, the readiest instruments of control, were inflicted on\r\ncalculation: there was, perhaps, no anger in the breast of the\r\naccuser--the defaulter he would have readily forgiven, had he stood\r\nalone; but impunity would relax the reins of authority, and the lash was\r\ninvoked because most convenient. The published documents of the House of\r\nCommons illustrate the perseverance of masters, in repeating their\r\nprosecutions; and the resistance and suffering of miserable men, who for\r\nthe long period of their service lived in constant warfare, and\r\nretaliated the social wretchedness they endured. An enquirer could not\r\nlong reside in the colony, without learning that many had borne a\r\nsuccession of punishments sufficient to prostrate the strength of a\r\ngiant, and which no mere animal in the creation could survive.\r\n\r\nYet this is not a fair estimate of the character of the settlers, or the\r\nresults of assignment; and a want of discrimination in Maconochie,\r\nhowever unintentional, was a serious injustice. It was true, that the\r\nconstant vexations of a settler's life produced, too generally, a tone\r\nand manner, striking to a stranger, because not so common under happier\r\ncircumstances. The substantial benevolence of many employers is not the\r\nless unquestionable: a large number continued their liberated men in\r\ntheir service, whom they had taught the arts of industry, brought under\r\nthe influence of moral instruction, and assisted to settle in life.\r\nHundreds scattered throughout these colonies, who were born in the\r\ncontagion of wickedness, were rescued from habits of crime by the long\r\nand patient training of their masters. That many such have become\r\nvirtuous, in the highest sense, could not be affirmed without hazard;\r\nbut can this be said of the majority of mankind?\r\n\r\nThe charges of Maconochie incurred severe reproach, for their rashness.\r\nIt is true, that the prominence of evil fixes the attention, while\r\nhumanity is retiring and noiseless--as the riot of the streets conceals\r\nrather than illustrates the sobriety and order within doors; but a\r\nphilosopher should have taken into account this facility of error, while\r\ncondemning with whatever severity the evils he might scan: lest he\r\nshould be found to set forth the exception as the rule, and the rule as\r\nthe exception.\r\n\r\nWere persons, who have passed through assignment, to give their\r\ntestimony, a very large proportion would acknowledge that their\r\ncondition was not unhappy, or their masters unkind. In his estimate of\r\nprisoners, Capt. Maconochie was equally deceived by a generous\r\nconfidence, or by his pity for human suffering. Some were, indeed, far\r\nsuperior to their degradation: they retained in bondage the principles\r\nthey had derived from education, or the dispositions natural to their\r\ncharacter: offenders by accident, not habit; and some condemned by that\r\nlast calamity incident to society, the mistakes of public justice. A\r\nmuch larger class were victims of early neglect: parental example, or of\r\nthe social evils which are incident to the refinement, corruption, and\r\nselfishness of the age; but very many, whatever the cause of their\r\ndepravity, were really and recklessly depraved. The pitying eye of the\r\nphilanthropist, glancing at their history, would find his compassion in\r\nthe ascendant, and in surveying their misfortunes might forget their\r\ncrimes; but to stand in contact with them; to struggle against their\r\npassions, to hear their profaneness, to correct their indolence, and to\r\nthwart their peculations--these were duties and trials, in the presence\r\nof which the highest benevolence became practical, and theory gave way\r\nbefore actual experience. Nor is it easy to discover by what plan the\r\ninjustice of European society, or the misfortunes of youth, can change\r\nthe colonial aspect of depravity, or supersede the penalties provoked by\r\nindisputable wickedness.\r\n\r\nA close examination of the records in the police-office, not only proves\r\nthe revolting severity of our penal administration, but by preserving\r\nthe original character and colonial career of the prisoners, illustrates\r\nthe depth, continuity, and recklessness of their guilt. It was in this\r\ndepartment of his investigation Maconochie dropped into serious errors.\r\nHe entertained the conviction that the far greater number were wicked,\r\nbecause they were unhappy: nor did he sufficiently perceive, that in a\r\nlarge mass of offenders the principles which debase them had become\r\nconstitutional by habit; and that nothing, short of divine power, could\r\nchange the current of their passions, or the course of their lives. From\r\nsuch a view of human nature the feeling mind revolts, and the\r\nphilanthropist may justly cherish those animating hopes which instances\r\nof reformation may save from the charge of folly; but a philosopher,\r\nconstructing a system, cannot disguise facts with impunity: and nothing\r\nis more certain than that he whose expectations are disappointed, feels\r\na dangerous reaction, and passes from unlimited confidence to\r\nundiscriminating suspicion. The administration of the criminal laws,\r\nboth in Great Britain and the colonies, presents a series of\r\nalternations between rigour and laxity, which have proceeded from the\r\nalternate ascendancy of conflicting ideas, that can never settle into\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\nMaconochie delighted to trace the better qualities of prisoners: how\r\neven the most daring are moved by tenderness, and when kindly spoken to,\r\nmelt into tears. Unhappily these characteristics too often exist in\r\ncombination with passions which render them useless. It is, however, the\r\nduty of all to endeavour to elicit and nourish them; for though they but\r\nslightly relieve the depravity with which they are not incompatible,\r\nthey afford a nucleus round which the social virtues often gather, and\r\nprevent the total despondency of those who labor for the welfare of the\r\nweak, the wicked, and the miserable.\r\n\r\nSir John Franklin made a last effort to save the system of assignment.\r\nHe defended the colonists from the imputations of Captain Maconochie,\r\nand exhibited statistics, which proved their anxiety to promote the\r\nspiritual welfare of the population. He maintained that the surveillance\r\nof the government was active, the distribution of labor usually\r\nimpartial; the protection of the prisoners from injustice\r\nsecured by law, by the press, and by the constant scrutiny of the\r\nlieutenant-governor. He argued that the quiet submission of the\r\nprisoners was not ensured so much by military power as the consciousness\r\nthat they were treated with justice. In his view assignment, by its near\r\nresemblance to the ordinary combinations of social life, prevented the\r\nworst consequences of penal degradation, and tended to rouse the\r\nsympathies which crime might have rendered dormant; he, however,\r\ndisapproved of assignment in towns, and for domestic service.[226]\r\n\r\nThe abuses of assignment were prominently exhibited in the instance of\r\nClapperton, a man greatly trusted by his master, Mr. Alfred Stephen. He\r\nwas guilty of embezzlement to a large extent: he was tried by Captain\r\nForster, and sentenced to fourteen years transportation; but Clapperton\r\nwas famous as a clever cook, and as such was desired by the colonial\r\nsecretary, who, however, judged it right first to enquire whether his\r\nservices would be in demand for the kitchen of the governor. The private\r\nsecretary waived the precedence, and Clapperton was accordingly sent to\r\nthe residence of Captain Montagu. On the way to his destination he\r\ncalled at the house of his old master, to acquaint the servants with the\r\nfavorable turn in his fortune: this became known to Mr. Alfred Stephen,\r\nwho found that, by the prosecution he had instituted, he had conferred a\r\nfavor upon an official friend. He immediately appealed to Sir John\r\nFranklin, who was evidently unconcerned in the arrangement: he recalled\r\nthe man, and sent him to labor on the roads. The public discussion of\r\nthis case excited a strong sensation: it illustrated the system, which\r\nsent one man to toil on the chain, and another to wear the livery of the\r\nsecond officer of the government.\r\n\r\nFifty gentlemen presented a requisition to the sheriff, to call a\r\nmeeting, to discuss the abuses of transportation: this, however, he\r\ndeclined, and the requisitionists permitted the matter to drop, lest an\r\nexposure should endanger assignment altogether. It could only suggest to\r\nthe British parliament new arguments for abolition, when it was found\r\nthat a doubly convicted offender was sent a few miles, into an opulent\r\nestablishment, to enjoy the dominion of the larder, to romp with the\r\nmaids, traffick with the tradesmen, and command the means of vicious\r\ngratification; while a simple rustic, fresh from his first\r\ntransgression, was subject to all the hardships of predial bondage.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: Despatch lo Lord Glenelg, October, 1837.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXI.\r\n\r\nBut Sir W. Molesworth had roused opposition to the prevailing system.\r\nThe Commons' committee examined twenty-three gentlemen, whose testimony\r\nwould be without novelty to the reader of these volumes. The greater\r\npart concurred in the inexpediency of assignment, and in the usefulness\r\nand importance of transportation. These witnesses were charged by\r\nMaconochie with a general indifference to the moral welfare and personal\r\nimprovement of the prisoners. A colonist would, however, easily\r\ndistinguish substantial benevolence from sentimental opinions; and they\r\nknew, by the trials of experience, how toilsome are the most generous\r\nefforts to correct habits not to be softened by the tears of compassion,\r\nand which do not yield to the wand of the magician.\r\n\r\nThe committee recommended that transportation to New South Wales, and\r\nthe settled districts of Van Diemen's Land, should be discontinued: that\r\nestablishments abroad should be limited to places where no free settlers\r\nwere allowed to enter; that the abridgment of a sentence should be\r\ndetermined by fixed rules; that at its close, encouragement should be\r\noffered, to such as might merit the favor, to go to some country where\r\nsupport could be more easily obtained, and character recovered; and,\r\nfinally, that no convict should be permitted to remain at the place of\r\nhis punishment after its termination.\r\n\r\nSuch were the recommendations of this famous committee, which were\r\ncarried into effect only so far as suited the convenience of the\r\nministers; who, however, stopped transportation to New South Wales, and\r\nrevoked the order in council by which that country was constituted a\r\npenal settlement. \"On the 1st of August, 1840,\" said Lord John Russell,\r\n\"transportation to New South Wales will cease for ever.\"\r\n\r\nIn van Diemen's Land, assignment was abolished: first in domestic\r\nservice, then in the towns; and the opinion was intimated by Lord John\r\nRussell, that he inclined to the views of Archbishop Whately, with\r\nlimitations and exceptions.[227]\r\n\r\nAmong writers upon the subject, who most strenuously maintained the\r\npolicy of transportation, may be enumerated Bishop Broughton, Dr. Lang,\r\nDr. Ross, of Hobart Town, Sir George Arthur, Sir John Franklin, Messrs.\r\nMacarthur, David Burns, and Captain Wood. They united in vindicating the\r\ncolonists from the imputation of profligacy and cruelty. Governor Bourke\r\nwas alone, among influential persons, a secret advocate of total\r\nabolition. In writing to the secretary of state, he intimated his\r\nconviction that, however strong the prejudice of the colonists in favor\r\nof penal labor, they were losers by the bargain; and that the social\r\nmischief gathering around them would soon demand a total cessation.[228]\r\n\r\nIn the voluminous productions, which for more than twenty years teemed\r\nfrom the colonial press, the idea of total abolition was scarcely\r\nsuggested; except, indeed, in the year 1826, a colonist, under a\r\nfictitious signature, hinted in modest language that free labor might\r\nprove the cheapest in the end. The notion was tolerated, while the\r\ncountry was ravaged by bushrangers, but it was only treated as a\r\ncuriosity and a dream.[229]\r\n\r\nTowards the close of 1839, a meeting was held in the Mansion-house at\r\nDublin, to promote emigration to New Zealand. A resolution was passed,\r\non the motion of Dr. Dickenson, the chaplain of the Archbishop of\r\nDublin, which exhibited a frightful portraiture of the Australian\r\ncolonies.[230] Dr. Dickenson dwelt upon the social corruption, and\r\ndeclared that it was in vain to imagine a colony, so composed, could\r\never become respectable. The natural conclusion from the proportions of\r\nthe census, the amount of crime, and the character of the expirees, was\r\nunfavorable to the colonies; but the imputation of general vice and\r\njuvenile depravity, were made most frequently by projectors of rival\r\nsettlements, and were tinged with selfishness. The object of the\r\narch-bishop and his chaplain warped their judgment, and their lofty tone\r\ninduced the public to believe that they were right; yet when they\r\ndescribed the colonies as vast brothels--as the dwelling of banditti,\r\nrank with the crimes and ripening to the ruin of Gomorrah--they were\r\nguilty of injustice. Many, who labored to civilise the brutish, and to\r\nreform the vicious, read with just indignation the statements of\r\npersons, whose station gave weight to their accusations, when they told\r\nthe world that the children of the settlers surpassed, by the precosity\r\nof their depravation, the dreams of misanthropy. Against these sweeping\r\nopinions, Major Macarthur, then on the spot, earnestly protested. Dr.\r\nBroughton, on this side the globe, made an energetic remonstrance, and\r\nasserted that the report of the transportation committee could be taken\r\nonly as the collection of facts, which were spread over a long period of\r\ntime, and were descriptive only of a base and dishonored fraction. He\r\nasserted that a series of the _Times_ newspaper contained a succession\r\nof atrocities which, if combined, would exhibit Great Britain as the\r\nmost worthless of nations.\r\n\r\nInspirited by Captain Wood, of Snake Banks, the settlers of Tasmania had\r\nendeavoured to check the calumnies which assailed them. A public\r\nmeeting, held when the report of the committee arrived, requested the\r\nGovernor to do them justice. Sir John Franklin warmly denied the\r\ncorruption imputed to the settlers, and the chief facts alleged against\r\ntransportation; and the clergy united in general commendations of the\r\nliberality, decorum, and religious habits they had witnessed. This\r\nappeal was not received with much favor in England, and the London\r\n_Times_ pertinaciously maintained that they were mere assertions of\r\nindividuals--who represented that Van Diemen's Land, far from being a\r\nden of vice, was the place to look for virtue.[231]\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Dublin presented a petition from certain citizens of\r\nLondon, praying for the total abolition of transportation. He declared\r\nthat no opposition, derision, or contempt, should daunt him. He advised\r\nthe establishment of insular penitentiaries in the neighbourhood of\r\nGreat Britain, and he moved that the punishment of transportation\r\nshould be abolished immediately, completely, and finally.[232] The\r\nBishop of Exeter, always in antagonism to Dr. Whately, asserted that his\r\nrepresentations were exaggerated, and that crime amongst the native born\r\npopulation was one half less than in England. The whig Bishop of Norwich\r\nsustained the views of Dr. Whately. In reply, the minister stated that\r\nthey had stripped transportation of its allurement. Some punishment for\r\nlife was essential; Englishmen would not endure the perpetual\r\nimprisonment of human beings, or the sight of felons in their streets\r\nworking in chains. It was resolved, however, to reduce the proportion\r\ntransported, and to promote emigration. Lord Normanby observed, that\r\nalthough the most reverend prelate had made the question the subject of\r\neight years meditation, he had not yet discovered a substitute which\r\ncould justify abolition.\r\n\r\nThe ministers of the crown resolved to diminish transportation, but\r\nnothing was prepared for a change so great as was implied by total\r\nabolition: they, therefore, adopted a middle course, and Lord Normanby,\r\nin a despatch to Sir George Gipps, developed the policy then in the\r\nascendant.[233] The principal scene of the future experiment, chosen by\r\nher Majesty's government, was Norfolk Island, commended by its healthy\r\nclimate, its fertile soil, and its seclusion.\r\n\r\nWhen the former settlers relinquished this insular paradise, it was long\r\nabandoned to desolation. The timber of the buildings was consumed by\r\nfire, lest the place should allure and accommodate pirates or enemies.\r\nIn 1825, when it was re-visited, the few swine left there had\r\nmultiplied; the domestic cats had become wild, and the trees were\r\nthronged with pigeons and doves. The ruined walls and blackened chimneys\r\nspread over with the unpruned vine, the coffee plant, the orange tree:\r\nthe road overgrown, the stone enclosure beset with rank vegetation,\r\namidst which many a garden flower grew wild, presented a scene, perhaps,\r\nunprecedented, except by oriental desolations.[234]\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to erect a prison on the island, in which a large body\r\nmight be lodged; for which plans were forwarded, and the expenses\r\nrequired authorised by the crown. It was intended to remove the convicts\r\nalready there; thus to preserve the prisoners transported from the\r\nunited kingdom from the contaminating example of their predecessors. A\r\ncommandant was to be appointed, at a salary of L800 per annum, who was\r\nexpected to avoid the extremes of laxity and severity; qualified by a\r\ndeep interest in the moral welfare of the prisoners. To this office\r\nCaptain Maconochie was appointed by Sir George Gipps, and was permitted\r\nto test the ideas he had propounded, and to seek the success he had\r\nforetold. It was expected by the government, that the labour of the\r\nprisoners would soon almost cover the cost of their support.\r\n\r\nThe advent of Maconochie created vast excitement among the unfortunate\r\nbeings. The active efforts of this officer altered the tone of the\r\nsettlement, and inspired the desponding with hope: they changed the\r\naspect of that abode of misery--where suffering, insurgency, and\r\ncarnage, had furnished a dark page in penal history. True to his creed,\r\nhe removed the permanent gallows, which met the eyes of the prisoners as\r\nthey left their barracks for their morning toil, and abolished the\r\ndoubly-loaded cats, which had been heretofore the instruments of\r\npunishment. The impulse was powerful: a new tone of command, humane even\r\nto tenderness; the promise of speedy deliverance, wrought on the minds\r\nof the prisoners with the force of novelty and surprise. The gaol doors\r\nwere thrown open: the gaoler loitered before the deserted prison, and\r\nthe prisoners yielded to the spell of a transient enchantment. On his\r\narrival, Maconochie issued an \"exposition\" of his plan: he told the\r\nprisoners that punishment would be inflicted, to inspire the thoughtless\r\nwith reflection and the guilty with repentance. Such would be its\r\nobject, and such its limits. He exhorted them to a manly endurance and a\r\ndiligent preparation to acquire the comforts of _honest_ bread. He\r\nassured them, that while the escape of the incorrigible would be barred\r\nfor ever, he would delight to hasten the freedom of the worthy. Thus\r\nthose that earned 6,000 marks would discharge a seven years' sentence,\r\nor 7,000 would be required for ten years' servitude; and 8,000 was the\r\ncomposition proposed for a sentence for life. They were, however, to\r\nenjoy a portion of their earnings, which they paid in exchange for\r\nluxuries, or to reserve the whole to hasten their discharge. Thus it was\r\npossible to obtain a ticket-of-leave in one, two, or two and a-half\r\nyears, from a sentence of seven, ten years, or life. He deprecated those\r\nlengthened punishments, which deprive men of the years of youth, and\r\nstrengthen and ripen every evil propensity into fatal maturity.\r\n\r\nWhile the government of Norfolk Island developed the novel system,\r\naccounts were conveyed to the colonies only at intervals: some in the\r\nspirit of hostility, and others because they were idle, delighted to\r\ndepict the enthusiastic Maconochie as the subject of delusion, and the\r\nbutt of ridicule among those he reformed; but the climax at last came.\r\n\r\nNever was Norfolk Island so gay, or its inhabitants so joyful, as on the\r\n25th May, 1840. A proclamation had been issued by Maconochie, describing\r\nthe pleasures and festivities he contemplated. On this occasion he\r\nresolved to forget the distinction between good and bad, and to make no\r\nexception from the general indulgence; but he entreated the men to\r\nremember that on the success of this experiment his confidence would\r\ngreatly depend: he warned them to suppress the first tokens of disorder,\r\nand by retiring to their quarters at the sound of the bugle, prove that\r\nthey might be trusted with safety. On the morning of the day, the signal\r\ncolours floated from the staff, crowned with the union jack: twenty-one\r\nguns, collected from the vessels and from the government-house, were\r\nmounted on the top of a hill, and fired a royal salute. The gates were\r\nthrown open, and eighteen hundred prisoners were set free, and joined in\r\nvarious amusements, of which Captain Maconochie was a frequent\r\nspectator. Eighteen hundred prisoners sat down to dinner, and at its\r\nclose, having received each a small quantity of spirits with water, they\r\ndrank health to the Queen and Maconochie--three times three for Victoria\r\nand the captain rent the air. They then renewed their sports, or\r\nattended a theatrical performance. New scenery, dresses, music, and\r\nsongs, contributed to the hilarity of the party. The performances were,\r\nthe _Castle of Andalusia_, in which the comic powers of the prisoners\r\nwere exhibited to their companions, a variety of glees and songs, the\r\ntent scene of _Richard III._, the _Purse, or the Benevolent Tar_, and\r\nfinally the national anthem.[235] At the termination, no accident had\r\noccurred; the gaol was entirely unoccupied; no theft or disorder had\r\ndisgraced the day; and thus the notion of Maconochie seemed to be\r\nillustrated by the experiment. The contrast with the past system created\r\nthe greatest amazement, and the description of this extraordinary scene\r\nexcited universal laughter.\r\n\r\nThe long habit of connecting the notions of crime and punishment, of\r\nguilt and misery, was thus violently shocked. Its novelty gave to the\r\npolicy of Norfolk Island the air of delirium: the disciplinarians of the\r\nancient regime raised their hands with astonishment. The place, once of\r\nall most hateful, painted by fancy became an elysium: employment\r\nenlivened by plays, rum, and tobacco, was described as a cheering\r\nvicissitude in a life of crime. It was not difficult to see, that a\r\nreaction would follow, and that any untoward accident would produce a\r\nrecoil.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that the prisoners at Norfolk Island deeply sympathised with\r\ntheir chief: that they combined in a society for mutual reformation, and\r\nthat the paper which contained the outlines of the plan was headed by\r\nthe well-known motto of the Irish liberator--\r\n\r\n\"Hereditary bondsmen! know ye not, who would be free,\r\nThemselves must strike the blow.\"\r\n\r\nThese promising appearances were soon followed by a catastrophe,\r\nattended with sad sacrifice of life.\r\n\r\nOn 21st June, 1842, the _Governor Phillip_ stood in the Bay. A prisoner,\r\nseated upon a rock, awaited the return of his companions from the\r\nvessel, twelve in number: they had been sent to assist in unloading the\r\nstores, and had remained all night. He heard firing on board, and ran to\r\ngive notice to the nearest officer: the vessel had been taken. There\r\nwere twelve soldiers, beside eighteen seamen. Two sentries were placed\r\nover the hatchway, but the prisoners were allowed to pass to the deck,\r\nwhere they noticed the negligence of the guard, which they rapidly\r\ncommunicated to their comrades below. In a few minutes they were all on\r\ndeck: they rushed one sentry, and attempted to seize his pistols; then\r\nthrew him overboard: the other resigned his gun. Two unarmed soldiers,\r\nwho were accidentally on deck, struggled against them; they were\r\nunsuccessful: one took refuge in the main chains, and slipped down into\r\nthe launch; the second attempted to swim ashore, but when within a few\r\nyards from the rock, he uttered a cry, raised his hand, and disappeared.\r\nThe sergeant having gained the deck, shot the nearest of the mutineers;\r\nbut he received a blow which rendered him insensible. The sailors ran to\r\nthe forecastle, and the hatches were fastened down; but the prisoners,\r\nunable to work the vessel, summoned two sailors from below to assist\r\nthem. The soldiers, having broken through to the captain's cabin, fired\r\nthrough the gratings: several mutineers were wounded. The convicts then\r\nproposed to send the sailors on shore, and demanded the surrender of the\r\ncaptain, who answered with a shot, which struck the leader in the mouth,\r\nand passed through his brain: the remainder instantly ran below, and the\r\nvessel was retaken. One soldier, who had attempted to reach the shore,\r\nhad been compelled to swim back, and had been saved by a mutineer; but\r\nin ascending the side of the vessel was shot by the sergeant in mistake.\r\nThe prisoners now asked quarter, which was granted; but one, on reaching\r\nthe deck, received a shot in the thigh: another raised his arms, and\r\ncried \"spare me!\" Either by mistake, or in revenge, his head was blown\r\noff by the fire of the soldiers. Thus the deck was covered with the\r\ndying and the dead. The wounded were landed, and the bodies of those\r\nslain were buried by moonlight.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were confined together in a large room of the gaol, where\r\nthey were visited by the chaplain and commandant, who both labored to\r\nawaken them to a sense of their guilt. Several were remarkable for their\r\nmisfortunes and their crimes. They were conveyed to Sydney in the vessel\r\nthey attempted to capture. On their arrival, crowds met them, anxious to\r\ncatch a glimpse of the men who had dared, unarmed, so bold an\r\nenterprise. They met their fate with fortitude, and their last words\r\nwere in grateful remembrance of Maconochie. The chaplain who attended\r\nthem, has described[236] the gratifying change of which he was the\r\nwitness; and mentions with natural indignation the negligence which\r\nsuggested the attempt, the cowardice with which it was resisted, and the\r\ncruelty displayed in its suppression.\r\n\r\nBefore deciding the merits of Maconochie's system by the result at\r\nNorfolk Island, it is proper to estimate the disadvantages under which\r\nit was tried. The island was not cleared of its former occupants, and\r\nthus its corrupting traditions were perpetuated. The officers employed\r\nhad been formed under another system: several regarded the process with\r\ncontempt, and were involved in quarrels with its projector. They\r\nresented the diminution of personal consequence, by an attempt to give\r\nprisoners the air of free men.[237]\r\n\r\nThe application of marks in redemption from a time sentence, was\r\nforbidden in cases of second conviction: thus, while some were spurred\r\non to labor by the prospect of earlier liberty, the older and worst\r\noffenders were rewarded in having at their own disposal the time they\r\nsaved by extra exertion; too often injuriously passed.\r\n\r\nThe small extent of the island, and the absence of a free employing\r\npopulation prevented an uniform practical liberation of the prisoners:\r\nvessels were not always at hand, and thus tickets-of-leave were granted\r\nto prisoners, who were employed on small farms allotted for their use.\r\nThe obstruction to rapid dispersion prevented the hope of liberty from\r\nacting on the imagination with proper efficacy. The experimental nature\r\nof the plan was injurious to its fame. It required constant adjustment:\r\nirregularities and excesses suggested new details, and gave to the\r\nmovements of the commandant the aspect of vacillation.\r\n\r\nThe settlement continued under the command of Maconochie four years;\r\nduring which time another Plan, known as the probation system, was\r\nlaunched on the sea of penal speculation. The destination of Norfolk\r\nIsland was reversed: no more the school of reform, it was to be made the\r\nlowest deep of transportation; and well has its destiny been\r\nfulfilled.[238]\r\n\r\nSir George Gipps, in his address to his council,[239] announced that,\r\nafter two years and a-half trial, it was found that the expense had\r\ngreatly increased; he had, therefore, resolved to transfer the prisoners\r\nfrom Norfolk Island to Van Diemen's Land. It had been at first\r\ncontemplated to establish in that island not less than from two to four\r\nthousand men; but this accumulation the ministers had found it necessary\r\nto abate: and he expressed his conviction that that settlement would be\r\nonly reserved for the restraint of incorrigible offenders, and the\r\npunishment of aggravated crimes.[240]\r\n\r\nSir George Gipps deemed it necessary to visit Norfolk Island (1843). His\r\nstay was too brief for more than a superficial survey. His impressions,\r\non the whole, were favorable. He found the men orderly, respectful, and\r\ncontented. The \"old hands,\" or colonial convicts, formerly subject to a\r\ndiscipline severe to cruelty, were softened in their demeanour. \"Great\r\nand merciful as the amelioration, no evils had resulted equal to those\r\nprevented.\" The lash was disused: the men were permitted to walk abroad\r\nduring their leisure; to fish or bathe; to mix sweet potatoes with their\r\nmaize bread--an indulgence greatly prized; to use knives, and other\r\nconveniences before denied them: yet beneath these pleasing appearances\r\na fearful demoralization was traced. The prisoners from Great Britain\r\nwere exposed to examples of appalling sensual degradation: vices\r\nprevailed which have ever stained that island.\r\n\r\nThe colonial press, uniformly hostile, was crowded with grotesque\r\ndelineations--a style of opposition, when not ill-founded, more fatal\r\nthan the most bitter criticism. The politeness of Maconochie to his men,\r\nand which formed a part of his system, was the subject of constant\r\nhumour: he treated them like gentlemen in distress; they regarded him as\r\na patron and benefactor.[241] The recall of Maconochie had been\r\ncontemplated from the publication of the birthday festivities of 1840:\r\nhis administration was, however, prolonged until 1844, from the\r\ndifficulty of finding a qualified successor.\r\n\r\nThe people of New South Wales, who regretted the abolition of assignment\r\nas a calamity, disapproved the scheme of Maconochie. The legislative\r\ncouncil declared against the transportation of convicts to Norfolk\r\nIsland, not only as hopeless in reference to the moral recovery of the\r\nprisoners, but tending to perpetuate all the evils of transportation\r\nwithout its advantages. They requested that prohibitory measures might\r\nbe adopted to prevent them from entering the colony at the expiration of\r\ntheir sentences (1840).\r\n\r\nThe trial of the \"mark system\" in Norfolk Island during a period of\r\nfour years, according to Captain Forster, totally failed. This was the\r\nmost important element of Maconochie's reform discipline. The men,\r\nhowever, found means to render the accumulation of marks independent of\r\nindividual conduct and moral reformation. The amount, which ranged from\r\neight to thirty marks a-day, afforded ample means for corruption. Clever\r\nmechanics were rewarded for their skill; the strong for their strength.\r\nThe convict clerks falsified the accounts; men transferred their marks\r\nto each other as a private traffic. Offences were mostly punished by the\r\nforfeiture of marks: blasphemy at thirty; insolence at fifty; and\r\ngreater insubordination, two or three hundred. These are the\r\nrepresentations of an officer hostile to the plan; but they are such as\r\nare probable in themselves, and are inseparable from every system\r\nadmitting indefinite good conduct as a positive claim to\r\nliberation.[242]\r\n\r\nThe officers had been permitted to keep shops and to traffic with the\r\nprisoners; and, it was said, that a vessel was freighted from Sydney to\r\nsupply them with goods. It was, however, asserted by Maconochie that the\r\npractice had prevailed before his time; that it was in harmony with the\r\nmilder views which led to his appointment, and conduced to the\r\ndevelopment of social virtues; that the re-convictions of persons\r\ndischarged from the island were one-third less than of prisoners trained\r\nin Van Diemen's Land. Captain Maconochie repudiated \"the fearful\r\nconclusion, that to make men examples to others, it is necessary to\r\ndestroy them, body and soul.\"[243]\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more ill-judged than the selection of Norfolk\r\nIsland for the experiment. The detention of the doubly-convicted, men\r\nlong practised in the vices of the island, was still more unfavorable to\r\na moral reformation. The preliminary accommodations, directed by Lord\r\nNormanby, were not provided: even friendly officers were not secured;\r\nand had the scheme been ever so sound in its principles, its failure was\r\ninevitable. In retiring from office, Maconochie was permitted to\r\nrecommend for indulgence all whose expectation of release was justified\r\nby his promises, and he left the island regretted by the prisoners. A\r\ntotal change was contemplated in the discipline of the place: Norfolk\r\nIsland returned to its former character as the \"lowest deep.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: These views are thus stated by the Archbishop:--\"Thus,\r\nunder a reformed system of secondary punishment, supposing\r\ntransportation abolished, it strikes me as desirable, with a view to the\r\npreservation from a return to evil courses of persons released from\r\npenitentiaries, &c., after the expiration of their punishment, that such\r\nas may have evinced a disposition to reform, should be at their own\r\ndesire furnished with means of emigrating to various colonies, British\r\nor foreign, in which they may mix, not with such men as their old\r\nassociates in crime, but with respectable persons unacquainted with\r\ntheir past history; and may thus be enabled, as the phrase is, to turn\r\nover a new leaf.' This, of course, implies that they should not emigrate\r\nin a body to any one place, and as a distinct class. For juvenile\r\noffenders the same course would, perhaps, be even still more\r\nsuitable.\"--_Letter addressed to the Rev. H. Bishop, on the evidence\r\ntaken before the Transportation Committee; containing his Grace's\r\nopinion on the efficacy of the punishment of transportation._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: \"I may venture to assure you, the colonists will feel\r\ngreat satisfaction at the declared intention (1833) to continue\r\ntransportation....

Yet I am aware that\r\nthis sentiment is not generally prevalent among the settlers, and I\r\nshall therefore abstain from troubling you with any detailed\r\nexplanations, upon which my opinion is founded.\"--_Despatch of\r\nMajor-General Bourke, addressed to Mr. Secretary Stanley_, 1834.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: _Hobart Town Gazette._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: \"Resolved--That in the opinion of this meeting it is\r\nunjustifiable to induce intending emigrants to take up their abode in\r\nthe midst of the vice and immorality which notoriously prevail in the\r\npenal colonies; but that such persons should be encouraged to settle in\r\ncountries, where they will not only be likely to thrive in fortune, but\r\nto lead good lives, and bring up their children in virtuous habits.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: _Times, February 11th, 1840._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: House of Lords, 1840.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: May 11th, 1839.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: For an account of Norfolk Island see vol. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: The following are the characters and performers in the\r\n_Castle of Andalusia_: _Don Caesar_, John Lawrence; _Scipio_, George\r\nRolfe; _Fernando_, James Walker; _Alphonso_, Henry Whitton; _Spado_,\r\nJames King; _Pedrillo_, James Monns; _Sanguino_, James Cranston;\r\n_Rafrino_, James Porter; _Calvetti_, William Smith; _Vasquez_, R.\r\nSaunderson.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: See _Chambers' Miscellany_, vol. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: The idea of employing the prisoners as jurors, will not\r\nappear more strange than as witnesses, except that it is unusual:--\r\n\r\n\"These may appear singular proposals, and I readily admit that the\r\nabsolute _rights_ of prisoner jurors, and thereby their power of\r\ndirectly controlling the course of justice, might, without impropriety,\r\nbe for a time somewhat restricted, though, if properly trained up to the\r\nprivilege, and this latter confined exclusively to men in their last\r\nstage, they would very rarely, I am certain, be found wanting in what\r\nwas required of them. But apart from this, the objects of interesting\r\nprisoners, when under a course of moral discipline, in the\r\nadministration of justice, and of giving them confidence in its equity,\r\nare very important ones--perhaps not any in all their management are\r\nmore so: and both are absolutely wanting now, and may well be so in the\r\ncircumstances in which they are placed.\r\n\r\n\"In 1839, the year before my arrival at Norfolk Island, 811 cases were\r\ntried; of which only four ended in acquittal--such was the certainty at\r\nthat time of conviction if accused. In 1840, I acquitted 90 out of 416\r\ntried. (I was then, perhaps, too difficult about evidence, and in my\r\ninexperience carried abstract principle too far.) In 1841, I acquitted\r\n25 out of 297 tried; in 1842, 24 out of 326; and in 1843, 16 out of 429.\r\nI was much in the habit of employing the officers about the court as a\r\nsort of jury, referring to them, though not formally, in cases of\r\ndifficulty, and inviting them to ask questions. And I very early\r\nappointed an intelligent prisoner, in whom I otherwise had confidence,\r\nto speak for men accused of local offences, and make the most of their\r\nseveral statements, on condition, however, that he never said for them\r\nwhat he knew to be directly false. He thus served me very much, for what\r\nhe did not say I sifted with the more care; and the plan altogether, and\r\nit is nearly that in the text, answered extremely well. It greatly\r\nimproved the pleader himself: under the new impulses given to both his\r\nhead and heart, he became almost a new man: while stupid prisoners, who\r\ncould not speak for themselves, had as good a chance given them as the\r\ncleverest, and the latter, another very important point, had no\r\nbetter.\"--_Maconochie on the Management of Prisoners in the Australian\r\nColonies._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: The following extract from Maconochie's pamphlet, may be\r\ntaken as his plan, matured by experience:--\r\n\r\n\"The management of penal settlements should be as follows:--1. A\r\nfictitious debt of 6,000, 8,000, or 10,000 marks should be created\r\nagainst every man, according to his offence, which he should redeem by\r\nlabour and other good conduct, having a proportion placed to his credit\r\ndaily as wages, according to his behaviour, and suffering a loss by fine\r\nif he offends. 2. No ration should be allowed him of right, except bread\r\nand water: for every thing else, following up the analogy thus created\r\nbetween marks and money, he should be charged in them. 3. He should be\r\nallowed, however, thus to expend his marks for present indulgencies to\r\nwhat extent he pleases, but never to obtain his discharge, till from his\r\nlabour and economy combined (both voluntary) he shall fully redeem his\r\ndebt. 4. On first arriving at a penal settlement, for a period not under\r\nthree months, but beyond that depending entirely on his own regularity\r\nand proficiency, and the acquisition of marks exhibiting them, his\r\ntreatment should consist of moral, religious, and other intellectual\r\ninstruction in a penitentiary. 5. After this, he should for a time not\r\nunder eighteen months, but the period also depending on the acquisition\r\nof marks, serve in a mutually responsible party, labouring for\r\ngovernment, and disqualified for any situation of trust, authority or\r\nindulgence under it, or for any private service. 6. After this, he\r\nshould hold for not less than fifteen months (making three years in\r\nall), and beyond this till he has fully redeemed his marks and earned\r\nhis entire discharge, a ticket-of-leave in the settlement. 7. In this\r\nlast stage every reasonable facility should be afforded him to\r\naccumulate a little money against his return to society. For this\r\npurpose small farms or gardens should be let to men holding this\r\nindulgence, at moderate rents in kind:--any stock or edible produce they\r\nmay raise on these, beyond their rents, should be purchased from them at\r\nfair prices into the public stores:--and a fixed proportion of them (3,\r\n4, or 5 per cent, of the entire number of prisoners on the settlement)\r\nshould further be eligible, as selected by their superintendent, to fill\r\nsubordinate stations of trust in the general management, and receive\r\n(say) 6_d._ per day as money salary, besides the marks attached to their\r\nsituations. (In my proposed regulations I suggest also another mode of\r\ngiving the men a little money to take with them on their return to\r\nsociety--which is, perhaps, a little extravagant, and it would thus\r\nadmit, at least, of modification; but the point is very important.) 8.\r\nOn discharge the utmost possible facilities should be afforded the men\r\nto disperse;--and their final liberation, as well as every intermediate\r\nstep towards it, should in every case depend solely on having served the\r\n_minimum_ time, and accumulated the corresponding number of marks. No\r\ndiscretion on either head should be vested in any local authority. The\r\nwhole arrangement should be, as it were, a matter of contract; and the\r\nlocal authorities should have no other control over it, than to see its\r\nconditions on both sides punctually fulfilled.\"--_Maconochie's\r\nManagement, &c._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: 1843.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: Address to the Legislative Council of New South Wales,\r\nAugust, 1842.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: \"The whole island, we understand, is in a disorganised\r\nstate, and thefts of every day occurrence.

The decrease of\r\ntransportation to Norfolk Island and Van Diemen's Land, was interpreted\r\nas an intention to terminate the system altogether. This was avowed in\r\nthe usual organs of the government, and the colonists were warned[244]\r\nto prepare for the change which awaited them. Thus the total number\r\narriving in Van Diemen's Land in 1839 and 1840, was little more than\r\n2,000: less than one-fifth of the usual number transported.\r\n\r\nTwo thousand inhabitants of New South Wales made a last effort to\r\nrecover their share in the benefits of convictism. They forwarded a\r\npetition to the British parliament, entreating the continuance of\r\ntransportation for five years longer. Lord John Russell regarded their\r\nrequest as a strong argument against compliance; and a few weeks after\r\nsettled the question by cancelling the order in council! The intention\r\nof Lord John Russell was to limit transportation to the worst class of\r\noffenders, estimated at 500 per annum.\r\n\r\nSir William Molesworth endeavoured to prevent the restoration of the\r\npractice, and proposed to supply the demand for labour by anticipating\r\nthe land fund. The decision of parliament was precipitated by the\r\ncontrivance of a friend of Captain Maconochie, Mr. Innes, who, in a\r\npamphlet of considerable acumen and literary merit, set forth the value\r\nof his scheme. He asserted that the advantage of transportation as a\r\nreformatory and deterring system, notwithstanding the numerous\r\nexperiments, remained yet to be resolved.[245] The House of Commons\r\nnegatived the motion of Molesworth (September, 1840), and the crowded\r\ncondition of the hulks excited serious complaints. The House of Commons\r\nresolved that the sentence of transportation should be carried into\r\neffect, and the prisoners sent out of the country. Lord John Russell\r\nthen observed that, although he admitted that it was desirable to send a\r\ncertain number of convicts abroad, where after their liberation they\r\nmight earn their own livelihood, \"he was bound at the same time to\r\nconsider the state of society, and not expose it to the evils likely to\r\nresult from a disproportionate number of convicts.\" (April, 1841.) He\r\nannounced that not fewer than 2,000 would be sent to Norfolk Island and\r\nTasman's Peninsula.\r\n\r\nDuring these debates, Captain John Montagu, the colonial secretary, was\r\nin England. The views of this colony were favorable to transportation\r\nunder the plan of assignment: many, indeed, were anxious to obtain,\r\nthrough the old channels, the supply of labour so necessary to their\r\nprosperity. Montagu succeeded in removing some impressions at\r\nDowning-street, unfavorable to the colonial masters, and was welcomed as\r\ntheir successful advocate and general benefactor. At a public dinner,\r\ngiven to celebrate his return, all parties united in expressions of warm\r\nrespect and gratulation. The roads, he observed, were to be made, public\r\nworks to be completed, and labour to be abundant. When in England, it\r\nwas said, \"Mr. Montagu steadily pursued one object: transportation--no\r\nmatter under what modification.\" The system of assignment had already\r\nterminated.\r\n\r\nIt had been determined that all new prisoners should be worked in gangs,\r\nand on their dispersion should receive two classes of tickets; the last\r\ngiving them greater freedom. It had been recommended by the secretary of\r\nstate, to compel the prisoners in service, to wear a badge; but this\r\nopen mark of slavery was exceedingly offensive, and indeed, as a\r\nmeasure of police, exceedingly impolitic--not only calculated to degrade\r\nwell-conducted men in their own eyes, but to facilitate recognition, and\r\nsecret signs; and perhaps the confederation of a large class, whose\r\nnumbers it was so desirable to disguise.\r\n\r\nThe probation system, initiated by Sir John Franklin in obedience to the\r\norders of Lord John Russell, was intended to combine the principles\r\nafterwards extended by Lord Stanley with some of the advantages supposed\r\nto result from assignment. The former practice, by which the government\r\ntransferred the prisoner without delay to the service of a master, left\r\nhis fate to accident.\r\n\r\nSir John Franklin endeavoured to meet, as far as possible, the views of\r\nall parties. To carry out the plans of Lord J. Russell, he proceeded to\r\nform gangs of from two to three hundred men, and to locate them wherever\r\nit might be practicable to render them useful. The superintendence of\r\nthe scheme he committed to Captain Forster, who at the same moment held\r\nthe office of police magistrate, and whose administrative tact was\r\nhighly esteemed. The effects appeared, at first, encouraging, and the\r\ndespatches of Sir John Franklin gave promise of success; but in 1842 he\r\nfound it necessary to recall the favorable opinion: he found that many\r\ngreat and formidable evils were rising into strength, and that the gangs\r\nhad far from realised his anticipations in the moral improvement of\r\nconvicts.[246]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that transportation would have been limited by Lord John\r\nRussell, had not a change of ministry thrown the colonies into the hands\r\nof Lord Stanley. This nobleman, who succeeded September, 1841, differed\r\ngreatly from his predecessors. He hinted that the colonies were not\r\nentitled to separate consideration--scarcely to notice, in the\r\ndiscussion of this question. That the interest of the mother country was\r\nthe final and sufficient object to regard; but he did not hold the\r\ncommon views of assignment. He thought that it had been far too hastily\r\ncondemned. Thus it did not seem improbable that on his return to power\r\nthe former system, so highly prized by the colonists, would be restored.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: _Courier_, February, 1840.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 245: The following eloquent and touching appeal closes this\r\nvery able production:--\r\n\r\n\"I am well aware of the scorn with which the main principle recognised\r\nin these pages--the reform of the culprit, is regarded by many persons.\r\nI know that the task is pronounced a hopeless, visionary one.

By Frederick Maitland Innes._ 1841.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: November, 1842.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXIII.\r\n\r\nWhen the new secretary of state saw that the probation gangs, formed\r\nunder Lord John Russell's directions, were not attended with moral\r\nbenefit, he attributed the failure to the defective supply of religious\r\nteaching, and not to the inherent qualities of the scheme. It became\r\nnecessary to reorganise the whole plan, and to provide for the\r\ntransportation of 4,000 men annually. Lord Stanley was greatly\r\nperplexed; but Captain Montagu (dismissed by Sir John Franklin) and the\r\nattorney-general of New South Wales happened to reach Downing-street at\r\nthe moment: in concert with them, Lord Stanley framed the celebrated\r\n\"System of Probation,\" which has astonished the whole civilised world.\r\n\r\nThe employment of men in gangs, had been practised from the foundation\r\nof these colonies: they usually, however, consisted of persons under\r\nshort colonial sentences, and who were only sequestered awhile from\r\nsociety. The distribution of ten or twelve thousand men over a settled\r\ncountry, in parties of from two to three hundred, and subject to an\r\noversight not usually exceeding the ordinary superintendence of free\r\nlabor, was indeed an experiment, and fraught with the most important\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nAt the head of this scheme was a comptroller-general, appointed by royal\r\nwarrant, who, as colonial secretary for the convict department, was in\r\ncommunication with the governor alone. Under him were superintendents\r\nand overseers, religious instructors, and all other subordinate\r\nofficers. He was authorised to make rules for the government of the\r\nwhole, and these were minute and elaborate; and gave to the department\r\nthe air of a great moral and industrial association.\r\n\r\nThe most severe form of this discipline was established at Norfolk\r\nIsland, for the prisoners for life, or not less than fifteen years. For\r\nthis purpose the island was relieved of persons entitled by the promises\r\nof Captain Maconochie to a more indulgent treatment, and the remainder\r\nwere detained to assist in the preparation of buildings for the new\r\nplan. Thus the traditions of Norfolk Island--a complicated theory of\r\nevasion, artifice, pollution, and fraud--were preserved on the spot, and\r\npropagated through all the gangs located in Van Diemen's Land.\r\n\r\nPersons sentenced for less offences, were transported to Van Diemen's\r\nLand: were formed into gangs, generally placed in close vicinity to the\r\nsettled districts. Into these, men were drafted from Norfolk Island,\r\nwhen their first stage of probation was closed. The superintendents were\r\ninstructed to keep a record of industrial and general improvements: the\r\nreligious instructors were to insert a similar statement of moral and\r\nreligious advancement. Thus it was expected, that at any instant the\r\ncharacter and merit of every man might be known. The denominations\r\nselected to supply religious teaching were the episcopalian, wesleyan,\r\nand Roman catholic. The convicts having passed this probation were\r\ndeclared eligible for hire at wages, and entered the service of\r\nsettlers. This portion of their progress was divided into three stages:\r\nin the first they were entitled to one-half, in the second to\r\ntwo-thirds, and in the last to their entire earnings. The masters were\r\nexpected to pay the surplus into the hands of the crown; and the\r\npassholder was informed that the sum, if not forfeited by misconduct,\r\nwould be receivable at his discharge, or in the event of death by his\r\nheirs. The fourth stage was revocable pardon, or ticket-of-leave: the\r\nholder could possess property, sue or be sued, and enjoy all the\r\nordinary advantages of freedom, subject to police inspection. The last\r\nstage, pardon--conditional, or free: if the former, it removed the\r\nconsequences of conviction in the colonies--if the latter, it had that\r\neffect in any part of the empire; but the enjoyment of this\r\nenfranchisement was made entirely dependent on the royal pleasure, and\r\ncould not be demanded as a right. Such were the main provisions of the\r\nscheme: so fair in its outlines, so prodigious in its results.[247]\r\n\r\nIn describing the operations of the probation system, it may be\r\ndesirable to trace throughout the branch established at Norfolk Island.\r\nMajor Childs, the commandant in succession to Captain Maconochie, was\r\nnominated by Lord Stanley. His fitness for the office was assumed from\r\nhis reputation as a strict disciplinarian: in this the minister was\r\nmistaken. It must not, however, be forgotten, that many of the most\r\nflagrant evils attributed to his administration, had existed at\r\ndifferent periods during the preceding experiments.\r\n\r\nThe island was annexed by parliament to the government of Van Diemen's\r\nLand, and thus terminated a connexion with New South Wales, which had\r\nsubsisted from the colonization of that country.\r\n\r\nCaptain Forster, who succeeded to the chief control, was hostile to\r\nMaconochie's system, and proceeded to interdict all the privileges he\r\nhad been accustomed to grant. A gang system of labour was restored; the\r\nbarter of food was forbidden; vegetable stalls, pork shops and general\r\nstores, herds of swine and private gardens, were swept away. Thus, to\r\nall the prisoners left behind by Maconochie, the new regulations were\r\nequal to an additional sentence.\r\n\r\nTwo classes of prisoners were sent to Norfolk Island under the new\r\nsystem. The doubly-convicted colonial prisoners, and persons sentenced\r\nin England to transportation for fifteen years or life: the accumulation\r\nof both was rapid. Many bushrangers and other capital convicts, were\r\ntransmitted to that settlement, to whom the arts of a prison were fully\r\nknown; who were celebrated as \"flash\" robbers; and who bore down by\r\ntheir tyrannical wickedness all the weaker or better men within their\r\ninfluence. The numbers on the island in 1845, were nearly 2,000; of whom\r\none-fourth were colonial or doubly-convicted prisoners. For these rapid\r\nadditions no preparation was made: the buildings in the island, adapted\r\nfor prison purposes, were dilapidated and insufficient. In the sleeping\r\nwards, the hammocks were placed in contact: the men were shut up after\r\ndusk, from eighty to a hundred together, in charge of a convict\r\nwardsman, until the morning. The place of promiscuous association was\r\ncalled the lumber yard, and was subject to the dominion of a \"ring:\"\r\nthere old and new prisoners met; it was regarded as an _Alsatia_, or\r\nsanctuary. To arrest a prisoner there would have risked the life of the\r\nconstable: attempts were sometimes met with concerted resistance: the\r\nwhole body would surround the culprit, and draw their knives in\r\ndefiance; in several instances the officers were assaulted with\r\nviolence. The assembly of such numbers in one spot destroyed all\r\nauthority: the officers did not choose seriously to infringe the\r\nprivileges of the \"ring.\" Those who gave information or evidence, did so\r\nat the venture of their lives. The harmless prisoners were the victims\r\nof oppression and rapid deterioration. At a station where the English\r\nand colonial convicts were intermixed, the colonial suffered various\r\npunishments, in three months 58 per cent., the English 30 per cent.;\r\nwhile the English separated from direct contamination suffered only\r\nabout 18 per cent. Thus contact evidently produced one-half the penal\r\ndisorders of the English convicts.\r\n\r\nThe incapacity and corrupt practices of the officers were serious\r\nobstructions to their usefulness. Thus, they were found to traffic with\r\nthe men; to obtain their services under false pretences. The\r\nsuperintendents left the actual supervision of the work to the convict\r\nsub-overseers, who, had they been inclined to preserve order, or to\r\nenforce labor, would have been liable to vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Thomas B. Naylor, chaplain, who quitted his employment in 1845,\r\naddressed a letter to Lord Stanley, describing the condition of Norfolk\r\nIsland. This letter was intended for publication; but being placed in\r\nthe hands of Captain Maconochie, he transferred it to Lord Stanley. Mr.\r\nNaylor asserted that the regulations were neglected: the commandant, a\r\ngood intentioned but blustering person, was utterly incompetent to\r\nsecure obedience. Thus the island was ever on the verge of insurrection.\r\nLarge gangs had succeeded by mutiny in obtaining terms with their\r\nofficers: the commandant himself had been knocked down. Convicts of\r\nevery grade were intermixed; the fresh feelings of English prisoners\r\ncruelly insulted; youths seized upon with abominable violence--_inter\r\nchristianos non nominandum_. He described the parade of separation,\r\nclassification, and religious instruction, as an elaborate scheme of\r\ndelusion.[248]\r\n\r\nThe reports transmitted by different parties from Norfolk Island, were\r\npublished in the colonial newspapers; and the lieutenant-governor\r\n(Wilmot) was induced to issue a commission of inquiry, entrusted to R.\r\nP. Stewart, Esq., whose bold and faithful delineation of abuses more\r\nthan sustained the rumours that prevailed.\r\n\r\nOn his return to head-quarters Mr. Stewart furnished a minute report. He\r\nstated that the reins of authority were relinquished, and that the\r\nanarchy and insubordination justified the fear that the whole island\r\nwould be involved in mutiny and bloodshed. He considered the commandant\r\ndeficient in the qualifications required by his arduous and perilous\r\npost. This report occasioned the utmost alarm, and the executive council\r\nresolved on the removal of Major Childs without delay.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Norfolk Island, Mr. Stewart, in obedience to his\r\ninstructions, recommended the commandant to a more stringent discipline.\r\nMany colonial convicts, who constituted the \"ring,\" exercised a power\r\nover the less daring, which intimidated more than the authority of\r\ntheir officers, or the fear of punishment. The \"flash\" men conspired\r\nwith the cooks to deprive their fellow-prisoners of their food, and were\r\npermitted to prepare in their own dishes the produce of their frauds.\r\n\r\nTo end this scandalous robbery of the well disposed, Mr. Stewart\r\nrecommended that all should be deprived of cooking utensils, and receive\r\ntheir rations dressed. Unhappily the stores on the island were not\r\nsufficient to afford the stipulated quantity and kind of food. Many\r\nsuffered from dysentery, which the medical officer considered to be\r\naggravated by the state in which the maize was prepared. The sweet\r\npotato, which mixed with the meal so greatly improved the diet, was no\r\nlonger attainable; pork was absurdly issued instead of vegetables; and\r\nthe deficiency of proper food--a greater grievance than any amount of\r\nseverity--provoked their murmurs and threatenings.\r\n\r\nAmong the leaders of the \"ring,\" were Westwood, or Jacky Jacky, and\r\nCavannah, both bushrangers, recently re-transported. They were both able\r\nto read and write, and possessed a sort of intelligence which renders\r\nsuch men more dangerous. The conduct of the English prisoners at the\r\nstations, where they were separated from the doubly-convicted, was far\r\nfrom disorderly, and punishments were rare. There was no lack of\r\nseverity elsewhere. A stipendiary police magistrate, appointed shortly\r\nafter the system was changed, organised a body of police: twenty-five\r\nthousand lashes were inflicted in sixteen months, beside other forms of\r\npunishment. The men committed to the gaol were often tortured: iron-wood\r\ngags were bridled in the mouth. Men were sometimes tied to bolts in the\r\nwalls, the arms being out-stretched, and the feet in contact fastened on\r\nthe floor: this was called the \"spread eagle.\" The solitary cells, as\r\nthey were named, were often crowded, and the men exposed to more than\r\ndisease. Yet all this severity was useless for the purposes of\r\ndiscipline, while the precautions against violence and crime were\r\ncomparatively neglected.\r\n\r\nThe apprehensions of Mr. Stewart were, unfortunately, realised. A\r\nmurderous outbreak on the 1st of July, filled the settlement with\r\nterror. The constables were ordered, on the 30th of June, to remove the\r\ndishes and cooking utensils while the men were in the school-room.\r\nWestwood was calculating a sum: at the sound, he raised the pencil and\r\nlistened; and a murmur passed through the classes: a sullen gloom\r\noverspread the whole. The next morning they were mustered for prayers:\r\ntheir conduct was orderly. They then marched to the lumber-yard; there\r\nthey collected in a crowd, and suddenly moved to the stores, which they\r\nbroke open and carried off their impounded dishes. They then returned to\r\nthe yard, and Westwood told them that he was going to the gallows, and\r\nadvised those who were afraid to keep back. Several armed with\r\nbludgeons; Westwood caught up an axe, and in a few moments four\r\nconstables were murdered, some in their beds. The military were\r\ninstantly called out, and in a very short time appeared, and the\r\nprisoners, without waiting a charge, retired to their quarters. When the\r\naccount of these proceedings were received at Hobart Town, a special\r\ncommission was sent down to try the rioters: thirteen suffered\r\ndeath.[249]\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly difficult to determine to whom the chief blame of this\r\nfatal disaster belonged. The officers on the spot, whose testimony can\r\nbe scarcely deemed impartial, alleged that it was chiefly due to the\r\nsystem of Maconochie: \"when,\" said they, \"the reins of discipline were\r\ntightened, the rage of the prisoners was unbounded.\" The police\r\nmagistrate declared that he had all along expected such resistance:\r\n\"before a more healthy state of things could be produced, a sacrifice\r\nwould be made.\" It is, however, obvious that no such necessity could\r\nhave existed, had the two classes of prisoners been divided, and proper\r\nmilitary precaution secured.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of August, 1845, Major Childs was succeeded by John Price,\r\nEsq., formerly a police magistrate at Hobart Town. This gentleman,\r\nremarkable for his knowledge of prisoner habits, language, and\r\nartifices, was represented by the local government as unusually\r\nqualified to put down the disorders which prevailed. The greater number\r\nof the officers, civil and ecclesiastical, were dismissed or recalled;\r\nand Mr. Price commenced his career with a vigorous, summary, and, it is\r\nsaid, merciless exercise of his authority. The agents he employed were,\r\nof course, liable to strong objections: they were chiefly persons who\r\nwere or had been prisoners; some remarkable for their crimes. The\r\nclergymen stationed on the island exhibited the most serious charges\r\nagainst the new commandant, and the persons acting under his authority\r\nand encouragement.[250] Cruelties of the most atrocious description, and\r\na toleration of evils of an appalling kind; but the often insane\r\nviolence of the men, scarcely admitted of either much caution or delay.\r\nIt could answer no purpose to collect the awful details. In part, these\r\ncharges have been disputed; but their substantial truth is, at least,\r\nrendered probable, by the accumulation of similar facts in the history\r\nof such settlements.[251]\r\n\r\nThe dismissal of the chaplains occasioned a long and painful\r\ncontroversy. The reports of their conduct appear to have been hastily\r\ncollected; often dependant on testimony which would never be received\r\nelsewhere, unless strongly corroborated. The entire spirit of convict\r\ngovernment is almost inevitably modified by its penal purpose. The\r\ninstances are rare where a clergyman, acting in harmony with the design\r\nof the gospel, could escape the censure of men who look on prisoner\r\npiety with habitual suspicion and disdain, and who consider \"doing\r\nduty,\" both the obligation and the limit of the clerical office. Thus\r\nwhen a prisoner desired to receive the sacrament, although a man of\r\nrespectable origin and quiet demeanour, he was sent to the church in\r\ncharge of constables, while men of far different habits were\r\noccasionally indulged with considerable liberty.\r\n\r\nThe constables were afraid for their lives: many of them, when the\r\ndiscipline became rigorous, implored to be removed from their office.\r\nOne was sentenced to chains, for declining to be sworn; another, who had\r\ngiven evidence, entreated a discharge: he was refused, and was murdered.\r\nThe civil commandant, Mr. Price, himself did not dare to neglect his\r\npersonal safety, and appeared with loaded pistols in his belt.\r\n\r\nWhen these accounts reached Downing-street, the abandonment of Norfolk\r\nIsland was determined. The secretary of state having read the letter of\r\nMr. Naylor, requested the lieutenant-governor to break up the\r\nestablishment without delay: to withdraw the whole population to the\r\nsettlement of Tasman's Peninsula, at the time a secondary penal station\r\nin Van Diemen's Land. No discretion was allowed in the execution of this\r\nimperative instruction. On further reflection, however, Earl Grey\r\nqualified his order.[252]\r\n\r\nWhen the proposal to vacate Norfolk Island, and to settle the prisoners\r\nin this colony, became known, the inhabitants manifested the strongest\r\nindignation. Their views coinciding with the wishes of the local\r\nauthorities, were received with respect, and the lieutenant-governor\r\ndecided to delay the measure until the secretary of state should be\r\nfully informed. The administration of Mr. Price had quelled the mutinous\r\ntemper of the convicts, and the removal of the better class had greatly\r\ndiminished the number. The desirableness of an island prison to punish\r\ncolonial offences, and obstinate insubordination in the English\r\npenitentiaries, overcame the intention to desert once more that spot, so\r\ncelebrated for its natural beauty and moral pollution (1849). The reader\r\nwill not, however, confide in present appearances; but will expect a\r\nrepetition, at some future day, of those startling disclosures which\r\nhave several times filled the world with horror.\r\n\r\nThe attempts of the convicts to overthrow the authorities have been\r\nnumerous. Three years after the re-occupation of the island (1827) a\r\nlarge body murdered the guard, seized the boats, and crossed over to\r\nPhillip's Island. Seventy were engaged, and their number screened them\r\nfrom the capital penalty. In 1834, a still more sanguinary attempt\r\nissued in the instant loss of several lives, and the execution of eleven\r\nmen. It was on this occasion that Mr. Justice Burton sat as judge: when\r\nhe heard the appeal which \"brought tears to his eyes, and wrung his\r\nheart;\" and which, recorded by the famous anti-transportation committee\r\nof the House of Commons, told with such power on public opinion. The\r\nculprit being brought up for sentence said--\"Let a man be what he will,\r\nwhen he comes here he soon becomes as bad as the rest: _a man's heart is\r\ntaken from him, and there is given him the heart of a beast_.\"\r\n\r\nSuch has been always the result of capricious severity; and not only to\r\nthe prisoners--to the ministers of vengeance might often be extended,\r\nwithout injustice, the appalling description.\r\n\r\nThe administration of law at Norfolk Island was but a choice of\r\ndifficulties. Special commissions were of late sent down, when cases\r\nwere urgent or numerous. The temptation to risk life for a release from\r\ntoil, or the excitement of a voyage, was thus removed. But at this\r\nsettlement the formalities of justice were but a slight security for its\r\nfair distribution. The value of an oath was less than the least favour\r\nof the authorities; the prisoners without counsel; the jury taken from\r\nthe garrison. A convict attorney was occasionally permitted to advise\r\nthe accused; but in the case of the July rioters such aid was denied,\r\nand several who were convicted, died protesting their innocence. During\r\nthe assize, one judge sat with the military as an assessor, under the\r\nold law of New South Wales; a second, under the law of Van Diemen's\r\nLand, which appoints a jury. Capital convictions were thus obtained by a\r\nprocess, one or the other, totally illegal. These would be deemed slight\r\nconsiderations, taken separately; but it is difficult to be satisfied\r\nwith a trial, in which all, except the judge, may be interested in the\r\nprisoner's condemnation. Substantial justice will not be long secure,\r\nwhen its usual conditions are either evaded, or are impracticable. A\r\ncivilized nation would release the culprit rather than condemn him in\r\nhaste, and the judge is criminal who smites contrary to the law, though\r\nhe smites only the guilty.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: Despatch of Lord Stanley, 1842.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: _Par.

It appears that constable\r\nBaldock was taking a man to gaol, charged with either having or using a\r\ntowel irregularly. He threw his shirt to Lemon, and asked him to get it\r\nwashed. Baldock would not allow him (Lemon) to have it. Upon this the\r\nman Lemon gave Baldock either a blow or, as he says, a push, when a\r\nnumber of constables fell upon him and beat him with their clubs. It was\r\njust as divine service was commencing yesterday evening. All the\r\nofficers and constables left the church, except Mr. Duncan, and the \"old\r\nhands\" made a general rush towards the windows to see what was going on.\r\nMr. Bott told me he interfered to cause the constables to desist after\r\nthe man was down, but Baldock said \"lay it into him--lay it into him.\"\r\nWhile down he was handcuffed with his hands behind him; after this he\r\nwas taken to gaol and gagged two hours, with his hands chained behind\r\nhim to the lamp post, having all this time his arm broken! He was then\r\ntaken to the new gaol, and Stephens sent for the doctor who received him\r\ninto hospital.\r\n\r\n_April 16 (Friday)._--Had a long chat with Dytton. He was chained down\r\nto the floor by Mr. ---- order, and had been gagged. I asked the reason:\r\nhe said for getting up to the window to get some air in the hospital\r\ncell, as the doctor had ordered him to have air and he was refused out.\r\nHe has been ill at the general hospital--had six or seven weeks'\r\nsickness--has never been well since a beating he received while I was\r\nabsent from the island. He was then in the chain-gang. Some pegs had\r\nbeen removed upon which he hung his clothes and rations. He abused the\r\ngaoler for removing the pegs; was gagged and taken to the new gaol, and\r\nchained down; was then dreadfully beaten by six or seven constables. He\r\nlay in a puddle of blood. The next day a constable came in and jumped\r\nupon him, and severely hurt his chest: he pierced his body with a piece\r\nof sharp iron or steel. He showed me a scar on his arm he had received\r\non that occasion. He said Mr. Elliot came to the cell and found him in\r\nthat mutilated condition, and asked ---- when it was done. ---- replied,\r\n\"he received a portion yesterday and a portion to-day.\"\r\n\r\n_August 6, 1847._--Visited the gaol. Found Waters strapped down on\r\nsuspicion of having prevented his eye from recovering. His back was bad,\r\nhaving been flogged, and the cord which laced the straitwaistcoat which\r\nthey put on him pained him much. His eye was very bad. He was laid on\r\nhis back, bound unable to stir hand or foot, and in agony of pain from\r\nthe pressure of his lacerated back on the lacing cord. Having asked to\r\nsee Major Harrold as a magistrate, he said to the turnkey, \"If I am\r\nguilty of injuring myself let me be punished; but if not, why am I\r\nstrapped down?\" For saying this he was flogged! He told me that Dr.\r\nEverett said he did not think he had done anything to his eye. I saw him\r\nagain soon after: he said his back had stunk most offensively, and\r\nthrough the intercession of the turnkey Mr. Price had allowed the cord\r\nto be removed; but his hands were chained to the foot of the bed. He had\r\nreceived a sentence of eighteen months on the reef in chains. [Note:\r\nSome of these chains were 36lbs. weight; and on the reef the men had\r\nmostly to work up to the middle in water.--T.R.]\"\r\n\r\n\"In one of the turnkeys' rooms in the new gaol is to be seen an article\r\nof _harness_, that at first sight creates surprise in the mind of the\r\nbeholder, when considering what animal of the brute creation exists of\r\nso diminutive a size as to admit of its use; but on enquiry it will be\r\nfound to be a bridle, perfect in head band, throat lash, &c., for a\r\nfellow creature. There is attached to it a round piece of ironwood of\r\nalmost 4 inches in length, and 1-1/2 in diameter; this again is secured\r\nin a broad strap of leather to cross the mouth. In the wood there is a\r\nsmall hole, and, when used, the wood is inserted in the mouth, the small\r\nhole being the only breathing space; and when the whole is secured with\r\nthe various straps and buckles, a more complete bridle in resemblance\r\ncould not well be witnessed. This is one of Mr. ---- instruments for\r\ntorturing the unhappy and fallen men, and on one occasion I was\r\ncompelled to witness its application on a poor blind wretch, named\r\nEdward Mooney. My duty required my attendance at the gaol occasionally.\r\nI came in one evening after eight o'clock. I was conversing with one of\r\nthe turnkeys; the notorious ----, who robbed Mr. Waterhouse of L700, was\r\npresent; he also at that time being a turnkey, holding a third class\r\npass, and in receipt of 2_s._ per diem. Everything was quite still. I\r\ncould not help remarking how quiet the gaol was, when the said ----\r\nexclaimed, 'there's some one speaking; I know what b---- it is;' and\r\nforthwith took from its pegs one of the bridles just described and a\r\npair of handcuffs. I followed him to one of the cells which he opened,\r\nand therein was a man lying on his straw mat undressed, and to all\r\nappearance asleep. ---- desired him to get up, calling him by his name,\r\nand to dress himself. He did so, and came out into the yard, where ----\r\ninserted the ironwood gag into his mouth, and the sound produced by his\r\nbreathing through it (which appeared to be done with great difficulty)\r\nresembled a low indistinct whistle. He then led him to the lamp post in\r\nthe yard, placing him with his back to it, and his arms being taken\r\nround were secured by the handcuffs round the post. As the night was\r\nvery chilly, I buttoned his jacket up to the throat, speaking at the\r\nsame time a few words to cheer him, that brought tears from his\r\nsightless eyes, to think that some one felt for his miserable and\r\nforlorn condition; and this convinced me still further, that even the\r\nmost hardened villain can be melted by kindness, however trifling.\r\nHaving enquired how long he was to remain in the condition described, I\r\nwas told three hours!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perkins had another drubbing some time since coming out of church. ----\r\na prisoner constable, was the first to fall on him, and after him a host\r\nwho soon covered him with blood and wounds, for not walking in a proper\r\nmanner out of church. And the commandant allowed this drubbing to stand\r\nas a sort of instalment of punishment when the man was brought up for\r\ntrial. On account of the beating he received a lighter magisterial\r\nsentence. Mr. ---- told me one day that the commandant censured the\r\nconduct of the constables who complained of some man not opening his\r\nmouth to have the inside of it searched for tobacco. It seems they were\r\ndeemed blameworthy for having in this instance neglected to use\r\nviolence. 'Why didn't you knock him down like a bullock?' was the\r\ninterrogatory at Norfolk Island!\"--_Correspondence_, pp. 41, 42.\r\n\r\n\"Before Mr. Price's arrival I resided for twelve months on the Cascade\r\nstation. Its strength was between three and four hundred men. I have\r\nknown this station to continue twenty days without a single case\r\nrequiring the intervention of a magistrate. Within three months after\r\nMr. Price's arrival, I have known forty cases for the police-office on\r\none single morning! Many of the men thus brought up were sentenced to\r\nsolitary confinement, and sent to the Longridge cells--our own not being\r\nsufficient to contain a quarter of them. The Longridge station had a\r\nstrength of five hundred men, and the united solitary sentences of both\r\nstations often trebly filled the Longridge cells. I have frequently\r\nfound in my daily visits as chaplain from twenty to forty men confined\r\nby threes and fours in the Longridge cells, doing what was called\r\n'solitary;'--three men sleeping together on the floor of a cell four and\r\na half feet wide by seven feet long. For pulling a lemon or guava--for\r\nlaughing in the presence of a convict policeman--for having a pipe--for\r\nwearing a belt or button not issued by government--for mustering in\r\ndirty trousers on Sunday, although to wash them the owner would have to\r\ngo naked all the Saturday afternoon--for having half or a quarter of a\r\npipeful of tobacco--for offences the most trivial, and sometimes on\r\nfalse charges--the most inoffensive and best behaved men of Cascade and\r\nLongridge were often to be found filling up the cells which might\r\notherwise have been set apart for the custody of some of the grosser\r\ncriminals who were tried at the assizes.... The convicts selected as\r\nconstables were like a ruthless band of predatory assailants, seizing\r\ntheir fellow-prisoners under any and every pretence, in order to have\r\n'cases for the police-office!' A first-class officer overheard the\r\nfollowing speech uttered by a convict policeman:--'I have no case for\r\ncourt this morning--what will Mr. ---- say to me? But a case I must\r\nhave--and a case I will have--and here goes!' This policeman proceeded\r\nwith another into the bush, and in an hour returned bringing in two men\r\non a capital charge. On the evidence of their captors alone these two\r\nmen were committed to gaol, tried at the assizes, and sentenced to\r\ndeath. By whom were the police compelled to such activity? By Mr. Price.\r\nHis opinion, publicly expressed, was, that a policeman could not be\r\ndoing his duty unless he had 'cases for court.'\"--Ibid, pp. 88, 89.\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\"A short analysis of the abstract would quickly strip the favored '25'\r\nof some rays of their infamous glory, and do more to expose the\r\nblunders, follies, and ferocious inhumanities of convict discipline than\r\nvolumes of concocted reports and oracular despatches. From his position,\r\nDr. Hampton must know that under the name of _discipline_, deeds have\r\nbeen done sufficiently atrocious to glut the soul of a Caligula. He\r\nknows that the perjuries and punishments about tobacco were sins that\r\ncried to heaven for abolition. He knows that in every seven cases out of\r\nten the convicts at a penal station are more sinned against than\r\nsinning. Nothing is required to prove this but a critical inspection of\r\ntheir 'police sheets.' In the court-house at Hobart Town, a youth, E----\r\nG----, aged 19, was on his trial for a capital offence. The crown\r\nprosecutor referred to the prisoner's _bad character_ as exhibited by\r\nthe unusual number of offences on his police sheet. The judge asked to\r\nsee the parchment. While looking at it, G---- said, 'Your honor, the\r\nwhole of them wouldn't make one ---- good one!' For a few moments the\r\njudge continued to examine the record, and then flung it on the floor of\r\nthe court-house with an expression of disgust at the childish nature of\r\nthe 'trifling offences' set down as serious crimes.\"--_Review of Dr.\r\nHampton's First Report on Norfolk Island: By Rev. T. Rogers._ p. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 252: Despatches, 30th September and 7th November, 1846.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXIV.\r\n\r\nBut Van Diemen's Land was the chief sphere of the probation system. The\r\ncolonists, at first, were not indisposed towards the experiment: the\r\npromise of an unlimited expenditure and a boundless supply of labor\r\nreconciled them to its gigantic proportions. It assumed the air of\r\nphilanthropy: Sir John Franklin, when he announced the first outline of\r\nthe scheme, referred to the redemption of the negro slave, and\r\nsaid--\"that England was about to incur a large expenditure in the\r\nattempt to emancipate her erring children from the infinitely more\r\ndegrading slavery of crime.\"[253] This picture was fully borne out by\r\nSir James Graham, who observed, in reference to the probationer--\"New\r\nscenes will open to his view, where skilled labor is in great demand;\r\nwhere the earnings of industry rapidly accumulate. The prisoner should\r\nbe made to know that he enters on a new career. The classification of\r\nthe convicts in the colony (of Van Diemen's Land), as set forth in Lord\r\nStanley's despatch, should be made intelligible to him. He should be\r\ntold that he will be sent to Van Diemen's Land: there, if he behave\r\nwell, at once to receive a ticket-of-leave, which is equivalent to\r\nfreedom, with the certainty of abundant maintenance, the fruits of\r\nindustry.\"[254]\r\n\r\nIn describing the probation system it is not necessary to do more than\r\nstate its general aspects and acknowledged results. The publications in\r\nthe colonies and the official documents substantially concur, and with\r\nminute controversy history has no concern. To view the subject with the\r\nprejudices of a party would be treason to those important interests\r\naffected by the question. Crime will still be committed--and its\r\ntreatment, the great problem of the age, is the business of all men.\r\n\r\nThe comptroller-general, Captain Forster, who obtained his appointment\r\nby the influence of Captain Montagu, entered on his office when Sir\r\nEardley Wilmot arrived (1843), and re-modelled the practical measures of\r\nDr. Milligan, who for a time, under the auspices of Sir John Franklin,\r\nhad possessed the chief command. Captain Forster was too well acquainted\r\nwith discipline to entertain the smallest expectation of ultimate\r\nsuccess. Among his friends he expressed his distrust without reserve:\r\nbut believing the home government irrevocably pledged, he concluded that\r\npenal philosophy was not his affair; and, not without reason, that he\r\nwas better qualified than a stranger to mitigate the natural tendencies\r\nof the system. He had not been consulted in its structure: he did not\r\nhold himself responsible for its errors or results.\r\n\r\nDuring four years, ending in 1844, more than 15,000 prisoners arrived:\r\nin 1847, there were, in all, 30,000. Free emigration was stopped. In\r\n1842, 2,446 emigrants landed; in 1843, 26; in 1844, only 1.[255] The\r\ngreater number of transports under short sentences became almost\r\nimmediately eligible for hire, who were at first preferred by the\r\nfarmers to free men. The free laborers rapidly retreated to the other\r\ncolonies. Gangs of probationers were formed throughout the country.\r\nTheir locations were chiefly selected with reference rather to their\r\neasy accommodation than their useful employment. A few large gangs were\r\nestablished beyond the settled country, but the greater part were lodged\r\nin the old buildings erected for the use of road parties, and\r\nill-adapted for either moral or industrial operations.\r\n\r\nVan Diemen's Land was supposed by the crown to be peculiarly fitted for\r\nthe experiment: an area nearly equal to Ireland, occupied by little more\r\nthan 50,000 inhabitants, appeared to offer ample room for the stations.\r\nIt was not considered that the free population was condensed chiefly\r\nwithin a line of country between the Derwent and Tamar, or on the\r\nborders of those rivers; and that however a temporary location might be\r\nchosen, the settled districts must ultimately absorb the pass and ticket\r\nholders. Most were within a few hours, nearly all within a day's journey\r\nof the free population. The ample supply of food; a system of moral\r\ntraining, which devoted considerable time to books and pencils; a\r\ndecided discouragement of strictness in discipline and severity in\r\npunishment, removed the temptation to rebel. The chief grievance of the\r\nprisoners was the prohibition of smoking, often indeed evaded by the\r\nconnivance and assistance of the overseers; yet, while at some stations\r\nindolence and plenty prevailed, at others, remote from the public eye,\r\nmisery and vice existed to an extent too awful for more than mere\r\nreference. At the coal mines the men were robbed of their provisions by\r\ntheir fellow-prisoners; new clothing was not issued until they were in\r\ntatters; hundreds were without shirts, scores without shoes, and some\r\nonly wrapped round with rugs (1843). These evils were certainly not\r\nlasting; but they have been by no means unfrequent at stations remote\r\nfrom the capital, and from the notice of the press.\r\n\r\nThe colony did not afford a sufficient corps of able and conscientious\r\nsuperintendents: many were military and naval officers, qualified to\r\ncontrol, but utterly unable to instruct. The quiet movement of the vast\r\nsystem was earnestly desired by the local government: its effects would,\r\nof course, be inferred from the absence of punishments; and it was\r\nunderstood by the lower officers, that the shorter their black lists,\r\nthe more agreeable their periodical reports. It was stated by the\r\ncomptroller that they were engaged to carry out the system, not to\r\ncondemn it; and disaffection ended in dismissal.[256]\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase of numbers disconcerted the comptroller. The new\r\narrivals were sent to crowd the stations of their predecessors: order,\r\nand even decency, were impracticable. The accommodation of the officers\r\nwas often miserable: too distant for proper inspection.\r\n\r\nAs the men removed from Norfolk Island were added to the gangs, their\r\ntendencies became more alarming and apparent: they were of the worst\r\npossible description, and defied all remedy.[257] No artifices of\r\nlanguage will enable the moralist to describe them.\r\n\r\nThe mean pay of the officers, their uncertain tenure of office, and the\r\nnature of their duties, would only attract candidates for employment as\r\na temporary expedient. The control of considerable bodies of men, under\r\nfavorable circumstances, demands both vigilance and firmness. The\r\nprisoners perceive, almost at a glance, the character of their\r\nsuperiors: their history and habits are the theme of constant inquiry\r\nand discussion. An equal temper and unwearied attention are required in\r\nthis arduous occupation. But the persons engaged were often wholly\r\ndisqualified by their past pursuits and personal character, to inspire\r\neither awe or respect. The practical oversight was often committed to\r\nthe least responsible.\r\n\r\nThe religious instructors selected by the government, though chiefly of\r\nthe episcopal or catholic professions, were of miscellaneous origin. The\r\nclergy of all persuasions were formerly admitted to the road parties;\r\ntheir discourses were welcome, for they gave an interval from toil: some\r\nperformed service on the sabbath at their own charge. The new\r\ninstructors were strictly official: some, indeed, highly educated men,\r\nof long standing in their respective churches; others were the\r\noff-shoots of various sects, without education or personal dignity. Of\r\ntheir qualifications, several high officers have spoken with\r\ncontempt.[258] These opinions were, however, partly the indirect result\r\nof disputes, in which the instructors were very generally involved.\r\nSeveral were known to convey accounts of evils within the stockades,\r\nwhich it was the desire of the department both to conceal and to\r\nsuppress: notwithstanding, many were deficient in zeal and ability.\r\nTheir labors were strictly formal, and were soon considered hopeless.\r\nSeveral exceptions must be understood; but to select them would be\r\ninvidious. The exclusive occupation of clergymen as teachers of\r\nconvicts, is generally unfavorable to their usefulness: the recognised\r\npastor of a congregation brings to the prison the reputation and\r\nsanctity of his character among the free; the instructor of a gang is\r\nsoon considered but as the agent of penal government.\r\n\r\nThe basis of Lord Stanley's system was an imaginary demand for labor in\r\nVan Diemen's Land. The home government was so confident in this\r\nresource, that placards were suspended on the English prisons, holding\r\nforth the prospect of high wages as the final stage of transportation.\r\nThe execution of public works in the colonies, except at an equivalent\r\nprice, was strictly prohibited. By improving the settled parts of the\r\ncolony, the crown might have increased its attraction to capitalists,\r\nand by diverting an excess of laborers excited the competition of\r\nmasters. The governor was desirous of allaying colonial irritation by\r\nsome substantial boon: the orders of Lord Stanley were, however, rigid.\r\nThe comptroller-general was forbidden to adopt any detailed regulation\r\nat variance with the scheme prescribed by the crown, or to alter or\r\ndepart from its provisions, without express authority.[259]\r\n\r\nThe demands of the settlers for laborers soon fell far short of the\r\nsupply. The written contracts for the passholders in the first stages of\r\nservice bound the master to pay over a portion of their wages to the\r\ncrown: this course was troublesome. Thus few, except in the last stage\r\nof their service, were able to obtain employment at all; and the\r\ngraduated scale of payment fell to the ground. The accumulation at the\r\nhiring depots, sometimes to the number of 4,000, who could obtain no\r\nengagement, induced the governor to urge their useful employment in\r\npublic works. He stated that neither private individuals nor the\r\ncolonial treasury could afford to employ them in improvements of\r\nprospective utility, and recommended that a fixed moderate payment\r\nshould be accepted, in return for the service they might perform. The\r\nreply of his lordship was decided:--\"If,\" he observed, \"the free\r\ninhabitants cannot purchase the labor we have to sell, at a price which\r\nit is worth our while to accept, it remains for us to consider whether\r\nother advantageous employment cannot be found.\" \"The necessaries of life\r\nmay be produced to such an extent, as to render the convicts independent\r\nof the free colonists, who are not entitled to claim any compensation\r\nfor the inconvenience with which their presence may be attended.\" His\r\nlordship proposed that new lands should be surveyed, cultivated, and\r\nsold for the advantage of the imperial treasury; and thus the government\r\nmight assert \"its independence of the settlers,\" and teach them to\r\n\"appreciate correctly the value of convict labor.\"[260]\r\n\r\nThe defiant tone of this despatch, and its contemptuous reference to the\r\nsettlers, determined the question of transportation.[261] The partizans\r\nof abolition could assail the system at its foundation. Thenceforth the\r\ninterests of the colonists, moral and material, were obviously one. The\r\ncrown was to compete in the market with the farmer and the landowner;\r\nand the labor market to be overruled by official contrivance, for the\r\nbenefit of the imperial treasury.\r\n\r\nThe colonial newspapers were filled with notices of robberies, and the\r\ncomplaints of employers. A rapid emigration took place: free laborers\r\nand mechanics sold their properties, acquired by years of toil, often\r\nfor a trifling sum; and the immigrants, brought to the colony at great\r\npublic and private cost, almost universally passed over to the adjacent\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nThe comptroller-general attempted to carry out the supplementary plan\r\nordered by Lord Stanley. Agricultural establishments were formed; but\r\nthis only provided for the probationers. The passholders were entitled\r\nto enter the service of the settlers. To detain them twenty miles from\r\nthe nearest farm-house, was to extend indefinitely the first stage of\r\npunishment; but when drafted to the settled districts, they could not be\r\nemployed,[262] except for the benefit of the colony, and against this\r\nresource the decision of Lord Stanley was imperative.[263]\r\n\r\nThe hiring depots were placed in settled districts or chief towns. The\r\nstage of rigid discipline being past, the convicts were not required to\r\nlabour with diligence, or suffer much restraint. They were now deemed\r\nfit for society, and it was merely the fault of their numbers that many\r\nwere unemployed. They were permitted to roam about in search of casual\r\nemployment--to spread themselves over the country. They were allowed to\r\nexpend the money they acquired in temporary service, and while any\r\nremained they were unwilling to accept an engagement. Thus they were fed\r\nand clothed, and lightly worked: they were free from care, their time\r\nwas running out, and they were objects rather of envy than\r\ncommiseration.\r\n\r\nThe official reports of the probation system forwarded to\r\nDowning-street, were not unfavorable. Lord Stanley asserted in his\r\nplace, \"that from all he could judge the system had been productive of\r\nthe most beneficial results, and that the general conduct of the\r\nconvicts had been most satisfactory;\"[264] but in his despatch to the\r\ngovernor, he complained that, amidst an abundance of statistics, the\r\nnotices of moral success were \"slight, unimportant, and few.\"[265]\r\n\r\nThe operation of the system was, however, well known to his lordship.\r\nThe under-secretary, Sir J. Stephen, with extraordinary exactness,\r\ndescribed the actual condition of the prisoner population--\"living, not\r\nby a healthy competition for employment, but by an habitual and listless\r\ndependence on the public purse.\" He depicted the apathy and indolence,\r\nthe low tone of moral feeling, the lamentable and degrading habits\r\nwhich prevailed; and asserted that in the hands of Lord Stanley, were\r\nproofs of an existing state of convict society, such as would be\r\ncontemplated with deep solicitude. It may not be impossible to reconcile\r\nin detail these official and parliamentary declarations; but, taken\r\nalone, they would lessen our confidence in the value of ministerial\r\nexplanations, not less than in official reports.\r\n\r\nThe comptroller-general stated that the system would not only prove\r\nbeneficial to Great Britain, but work a great moral reformation in the\r\nconvict population:[266] \"that it had fully answered its object.\" These\r\nassertions were confirmed by the governor, who remarked, \"that the men\r\nbehaved as well as possible.\" Such views were strongly opposed by other\r\ntestimony; among the most conspicuous was that of Dr. Hampton,\r\nsurgeon-superintendent of the _Sir George Seymour_, who, charged with\r\nthe care of a party from Pentonville prison, resided some time in the\r\ncolony. He described the prisoner population as sunk in the deepest\r\ndebasement; the ticket-holders in great misery; the reformed prisoners\r\ncommitted to the charge of felons; the better disposed taunted as \"pets,\r\npsalm-singers, and Pentonvillains.\" Whatever had been most strongly\r\naffirmed by the enemies of the system, was amply sustained by his\r\ntestimony.[267]\r\n\r\nTo the same effect was the evidence of Mr. Boyd, formerly of\r\nPentonville, and appointed an assistant-superintendent to Darlington,\r\nMaria Island. This station was regarded by the government as superior to\r\nall. Separated entirely from the free population, it was accessible only\r\nby authority; yet close to head-quarters, it had the advantage of direct\r\ninspection and control. There were, at this time, 800 persons subject to\r\ntwenty-one officers, civil and religious. Not a single soldier was on\r\nthe island, and yet there were \"no prisoners more orderly, or better\r\nbehaved, in Van Diemen's Land.\"[268] This reputation it maintained,\r\nwhile the stations of Rocky Hills and Broad Marsh, were infamous for the\r\nabandonment of all order and decency. \"Few could be favorably compared\r\nwith Darlington, and none possessed its local advantages.\"[269] But the\r\ninterior, as described by Mr. Boyd, entirely changes the scene. He\r\ndeclared the precautions against corrupt intercourse insufficient and\r\nunsuccessful: the most disgusting language was common; hoary villains\r\nand boys were worked together; the school books were torn and defaced;\r\neducation was mere pretence; a large proportion of offences were\r\nunpunished; lashes were received in hardened indifference; the criminal\r\nhabits of the men were unbroken; conspiracies to murder were frequently\r\ndenounced. On the whole he concluded, that there could exist no better\r\nschool of crime than a probation station.[270]\r\n\r\nThe laxity which prevailed was everywhere confessed, except by the\r\nimmediate dependents of government. The Rev. Mr. Fry, a clergyman of\r\nHobart Town, differed, however, with the colony in general. His earnest\r\ndefence of the probation system (1845) was published by command, and\r\nquoted by Lord Stanley in the House of Lords. He asserted that the\r\nconvict population had placed the settlers in ease and opulence; and\r\nthat the bulk of the colonists were emancipists, who were bound to\r\nassist the condemned outcasts of Europe to acquire honesty and\r\nindependence. \"The clank of chains,\" said the reverend gentleman, \"is\r\nnow seldom heard, and the deportment of free laborers, grateful and\r\nrespectful, has succeeded to the scowl of malignity, with which the\r\nassigned white slaves regarded their owners.\" He asserted that the gangs\r\nrecalled the men from intemperance; that they were attentive to\r\nreligious teaching; that the parties, although almost abandoned to\r\nself-discipline, yet lived tranquilly, unawed by surrounding force.\r\nThese opinions were afterwards modified.[271]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the habitual acquiescence of the colonists in the\r\nmeasures of the crown, the development of Lord Stanley's system\r\noccasioned considerable sensation. The rapid increase of prisoners early\r\nexcited alarm. The masses accumulated from all parts of the empire\r\npresented a new and fearful aspect: crimes reached a height beyond\r\nexample in any civilised country. The settlers, environed by parties,\r\nwere subject to frequent irruptions, and were compelled to guard their\r\ndwellings, as if exposed to a foreign enemy. The men wandered miles from\r\nthe stations, alone: at the hiring depots they were left almost to their\r\ndiscretion. According to the evidence of a magistrate, neither the\r\ncomptroller-general, nor any confidential subordinate, visited the\r\nstation of Cleveland from its establishment to its dissolution. At\r\nanother, ninety men, near the township of Oatlands, under the charge of\r\none free overseer, were worked in a line of seven miles extent. A\r\nsettler, whose flocks had been pillaged, brought back twice in one month\r\nthe same party; and again they escaped, threatening vengeance on the\r\nauthors of their arrest. At Jerusalem station, 800 convicts were\r\npermitted to roam on their parole; to carry bundles in and out of\r\nbarracks unsearched; to disguise their persons, and to change their\r\ndress. Their daring highway robberies ended in the proof of these facts\r\nbefore the supreme court at Hobart Town. At Deloraine, nearly one\r\nthousand prisoners were in charge of twenty persons, including the\r\nmilitary: on one occasion, eighteen started for the bush, and filled the\r\nneighbourhood with terror. The local authorities could offer nothing but\r\ncondolence; and even this poor relief was presented in a peculiar form.\r\nIt was alleged that the amount of depredation and violence had not risen\r\nmore rapidly than the number of convicts. This was scarcely correct; but\r\nit was little consolatory to the sufferers, assailed so much the more\r\nfrequently, though by different hands.[272] Their honors the judges,\r\nwith repeated and pointed condemnation, reprehended the utter want of\r\nproper surveillance and restraint, as cruel alike to the settlers and\r\nthe convicts. Nor were the towns exempt from extraordinary inundations:\r\nmany hundreds of men were turned out from the penitentiary on Saturday\r\nafternoon, and were thus exposed to the temptations of a populous city.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the department were charged with the trial of a system\r\nprofessing to breathe the most exalted charity. Had they, however,\r\ndesigned to expose theoretical benevolence to endless execration, no\r\ncourse could have been chosen more obvious. The liberty and indulgence\r\ngiven to the unfortunate prisoners seemed to bring them purposely within\r\nthe circle of their old temptations. Many were led into scenes which act\r\nwith fascinating power on men of criminal tendencies: they were often\r\nseen lingering for hours around the doors of houses for the sale of\r\nliquor. Amusements, which are always attended with some peril, were\r\nrendered more public and accessible. Dancing houses of the lowest kind\r\nwere licensed, until their noise and confusion compelled their\r\nsuppression. The regulation of night-passes became much less practically\r\nstringent. Everything facilitated the allurements and the commerce of\r\ncrime. Receivers were always at hand, and robbers were tolerably insured\r\nwhen the first danger was over, by the rapid shipment of their spoil.\r\nOffenders, practised in the fraud of cities, were admitted into the\r\ntowns, and placed in situations precisely calculated to recall their\r\nformer habits, and excite their habitual passions. The puisne judge, in\r\npassing sentence on prisoners of this class, for new crimes, and holding\r\nup their police character in his hands, exclaimed--\"Now, Mr.\r\nAttorney-general, I ask you what we may expect if such men as these are\r\nassigned in towns. Is it not surprising that I have to try such cases?\r\nIt is shameful! It is shameful!\" And such will be the opinion of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThe chief expedients of Lord Stanley to relieve the colony from the\r\nredundancy of labor, and pressure on the treasury, were never applied.\r\nAt the suggestion of Mr. Bishton, a clergyman of Westbury, Sir Eardley\r\nWilmot recommended the leasing portions of land to well conducted\r\nticket-holders. This was however strongly opposed on the spot, as\r\ntending to depreciate property, and inconsistent with the social\r\ncircumstances of the country. The English allotment system was\r\ninapplicable: at home, it is a subsidiary to the general resources of\r\nthe laborer, who can commonly find employment with the farmers, and\r\neasily dispose of the produce of his supplementary toil.\r\n\r\nBut a project of greater moment was contemplated by Lord Stanley, and\r\nadopted by Mr. Gladstone, and advanced far towards completion. This was\r\nthe formation of a new colony, called North Australia. The civil list,\r\ncomposed of officers of modest designations--as superintendent, chairman\r\nof sessions, and clerk of the peace--was framed with the strictest\r\neconomy, and the expense was to be defrayed by the English treasury. The\r\ncolonists for the most part were to consist of exiles landed with\r\npardons, either from England or Van Diemen's Land, and thither female\r\nprisoners were intended to be sent. During the first three years only\r\nnew settlers were to be furnished with food for one year; with clothing,\r\ntents, tools, bedding, and seed. L10,000 in all, were to be expended in\r\npublic buildings. To the office of superintendent, Colonel Barney was\r\nappointed, under the governor of New South Wales. A party set out for\r\ntheir destination: they were discouraged by the appearance of the\r\ncountry, but before an experiment could be made they were recalled.\r\n\r\nA more practical measure was the extension of conditional pardons to the\r\nneighbouring countries, the operation of which had been limited to Van\r\nDiemen's Land. The dearth of labor in New Holland induced the settlers\r\nto send vessels to this colony, and many hundreds, liberated by the new\r\nform of pardon, were conveyed to pastoral districts on the opposite\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nDuring the short official relation of Mr. Secretary Gladstone, who in\r\n1846 succeeded Lord Stanley, Sir Eardley Wilmot was recalled, and Mr. La\r\nTrobe and Sir William Denison were placed in succession at the head of\r\nour colonial affairs. Like his predecessor, Mr. Gladstone complained\r\nthat the information conveyed by Wilmot and the comptroller-general,\r\namidst abundant statistics, left the main moral questions obscure. Mr.\r\nForster had passed beyond the reach of censure; and Sir Eardley Wilmot\r\nmaintained that the actual evils imputed had formed the topic of\r\nincessant communications. He derived his impressions from others; and\r\nseeing but the surface, was persuaded to the last that the probation\r\nsystem had not failed.\r\n\r\nThe despatch of Mr. La Trobe fully corroborated the common report. His\r\nhonest discrimination was worthy his high reputation for integrity.\r\nNothing the reader has perused will be unsustained by his more elaborate\r\nanalysis--which may be expressed in one sentence--as illustrating both\r\nthe high-wrought theory and the mischievous practice of the probation\r\ndepartment:--\"In spite of all the superior arrangements of the system,\r\nvice of every description is to be met with on every hand: not as an\r\nisolated spot, but as a pervading stain.\"[273]\r\n\r\nDr. Hampton, whose representations had largely contributed to these\r\nofficial changes, which were however fortified by a mass of concurrent\r\ntestimony, received the appointment of comptroller-general. Meanwhile\r\nthe office of secretary of state for the colonies devolved on Earl Grey,\r\nand at his assumption of office he abandoned at once all the schemes of\r\nhis predecessors. The practice of transportation he resolved to\r\ndiscontinue, and in its stead to inflict punishment at home; and to send\r\nout the prisoners, when entitled to liberation, to the various colonies\r\nof the British empire. His expectation that their labor would be highly\r\nprized, was fortified by the \"Associations\" at Port Phillip to obtain\r\nlaborers from Van Diemen's Land, and the resolutions of the committee of\r\nthe New South Wales Council, where a strong disposition was exhibited,\r\non the part of employers, to renew transportation. Several ship-loads\r\nhad been sent from Pentonville, and the nominal lists of their\r\nemployment and wages, appeared to assure an unbounded field for their\r\nsuccessors. To shut out the possibility of complaint, however, Earl Grey\r\nsent circulars to all the colonies on this side the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nThe reply was universally adverse; and this plan, which a few years\r\nbefore would have been gladly accepted, was rendered impracticable\r\nperhaps for ever.\r\n\r\nThe total abandonment of North Australia was a subject of deep regret to\r\nits projectors, and was too hastily done; but as a substitute, Earl Grey\r\nproposed the creation of villages in the more remote districts of Van\r\nDiemen's Land. The erection of houses and a limited cultivation of\r\nforest land, was expected by his lordship to afford employment for the\r\nticket holders, and to yield a fund for an equal amount of free\r\nemigration. It was intended these dwellings, built on quarter acre\r\nallotments, should be sold to prisoners, or subject to a rental of L5\r\nper annum; and a clergyman and schoolmaster provided in each. It would\r\nbe useless even to examine the plan, which was based on a valuation of\r\ncrown lands at that time entirely erroneous, and a fallacious estimate\r\nof mere labor, in any form whatever.\r\n\r\nLate changes, effected by a more intelligent superintendence, and the\r\nvigilant censorship of the public, may be readily confessed. The\r\ndecrease of numbers in the gangs, and the greatly improved resources of\r\nthe convict department, have ameliorated several evils which formerly\r\nelicited great complaint. The male establishments at Hobart Town are\r\npatterns of neatness--the female, of disorder.\r\n\r\nIt merely remains to be stated, that the present system is to send out\r\nprisoners when entitled to tickets-of-leave; to disperse them through\r\nvarious districts in search of labor. In the colony they enjoy all the\r\nprivileges of free laborers, except responsibility to a police\r\nmagistrate. They will be entitled to release at a term prefixed, but on\r\ncondition that they pay a sum for their passage. Few have either the\r\nability or self-restraint required by this regulation, and unless it is\r\nrelaxed they must remain prisoners during the term of their\r\nsentence--often for life.\r\n\r\nA great variety of details might be added; but the total revolution in\r\nthe system will now lead the enquirer into the state of society rather\r\nthan the management of gangs and penitentiaries. The despatches, which\r\nfill volumes of blue books, are rather transactions of penal\r\nphilosophers than trustworthy guides to the historian of transportation;\r\nand the writer has not relied exclusively on these authorities, even\r\nwhen he has quoted them--a discretion amply justified by their endless\r\ncontradictions.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 253: Address to Council, June, 1841.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: Sir James Graham, December, 1842.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 255: _Report of Emigration Commissioners._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: \"It is but just for me to observe, that the state of\r\nvarious convict establishments, inquiring into the conduct of the\r\nvarious officers engaged, was not so generally unfavorable as I had been\r\nled to anticipate.

In\r\nfuture ages their conduct will be regarded as one of the few examples of\r\na people struggling against temporal advantages for morality and virtue;\r\nand if the desire of removing a grievous injury, and aiding the\r\nsufferers in recovering from its effects, be a noble feeling, the people\r\nof England are bound to afford their powerful sympathy and assistance to\r\nthe inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land.\"--_A System of Penal Discipline,\r\nwith a Report on the Treatment of Prisoners in Great Britain and Van\r\nDiemen's Land.

One of them seizes him by the throat, and\r\nthreatens his life: the timely appearance of his brother enables him to\r\nsecure them both. He conveys them to the station, lays before the\r\nmagistrate a charge, who sentences them. They are turned out among the\r\ngang, without special permanent restraint, and abscond again.

After\r\ndwelling upon the absolute necessity that the executive should rigidly\r\ncarry out the sentences of the court, he added, 'I am sorry to say that\r\nwithin the last two or three sessions some twenty or thirty cases of\r\nthis description (cutting and wounding) have been tried in this court,\r\nas great a number as were formerly tried in two or three years, and also\r\nof a more aggravated character.'\"--Ibid.\r\n\r\n\"The evidence of Mr. James Arnold Wheeler, the superintendent of the St.\r\nMary's Pass station, exposed some of the beauties of the system.

It was,\r\nof course, important to ascertain who was absent from the station at\r\nthat particular period, and Mr. Wheeler stated that he could not tell,\r\nas all the third class had liberty to roam about within hearing of the\r\nbell, about half a mile in any direction from the establishment.

Until recently, the attention of the English government has been\r\nalmost entirely confined to the management of male convicts; and the\r\nimpression has been always too general, that the unhappy women are\r\nbeyond recovery. In the local discussion of the convict question the\r\ndeliberate opinion of Captain Forster has been usually adopted, by all\r\nwho have seen the conduct of the women. \"I have not,\" said that\r\ndistinguished officer, \"entered upon the topic of discipline for female\r\nconvicts, not considering them available subjects for prison\r\ndiscipline.\" (1837) Colonial experience, before and since, would hardly\r\nauthorise any other conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe first female transports were left to the casualties of a convict\r\ncolony. Some, who were adopted by the officers, became the mothers of\r\nrespectable families: some wholly emerged from their degradation, and\r\nbecame respectable wives; but, for the most part, they merely exhibited\r\nthe depth to which vice can depress. Nearly 20,000 have been\r\ntransported; of these, a considerable proportion have fallen victims to\r\nintemperance, and sunk into a premature grave.\r\n\r\nThe description of the conduct of female prisoners is so uniform, that\r\nany date and any account might be joined at random. Those who read the\r\nworks of Collins, of Read, of Henderson, and of Lang, and compare them\r\nwith each other, and with works of the present time, will find little\r\nvariety of incident. They represent woman deprived of the graces of her\r\nown sex, and more than invested with the vices of man.\r\n\r\nThe transportation of women has been a great social evil to the\r\ncolonies. At first it seemed unavoidable: it was afterwards deemed\r\nhighly expedient, for reasons it is not necessary to describe. Yet it is\r\nnot too much to attribute the chief vexations of domestic life to their\r\ncharacter and conduct. It would have been better for the nation, for the\r\nmale convicts, and for the women themselves, had they been detained at\r\nhome, or banished to countries where they would have avoided the double\r\ndegradation of moral and social infamy.[274] Such were the views of many\r\nmost enlightened men. The extreme difficulty of finding them employment\r\nas servants, and their perpetual relapses, have induced the government\r\nusually to encourage, at first concubinage, and, in more scrupulous\r\ntimes--marriage: in some instances with great success. It is the last\r\nexpedient in the administration of penal laws; when it fails, the case\r\nis considered hopeless.\r\n\r\nThe number of females transported, until within twelve years, were about\r\n1 to 10 men; since then, they have been about 1 to 7. The penalty has\r\nbeen inflicted for the lighter crimes; and in many instances the Irish\r\ncourts must have been influenced rather by a vague notion of humanity\r\nthan of punishing offenders. Such are often young creatures: not a few\r\ncould be scarcely considered depraved.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation on the hands of the government has been usually very\r\ngreat, and curious expedients have been devised to dispose of the\r\nburden. The factory at Parramatta, in former times, was a mart of women.\r\nThither the laboring man went in search of a wife, and often, after a\r\ngeneral survey, selected one on the spot. These marriages were not\r\nalways a failure, but far the greater number ended in intemperance and\r\nprostitution.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the reluctance of the settlers to employ them, Sir George\r\nMurray, when secretary for the colonies, directed the governor to compel\r\nthe settlers to receive one woman with three or four men (1829). The\r\neffect of this stipulation was probably never considered. The condition\r\nof the better disposed has been one of great hazard and temptation. The\r\nlast state of female degradation was often their inevitable lot. They\r\nwere surrendered to solicitations and even violence: a convict constable\r\nconducted them to the houses of their master; they lodged on the road,\r\nwherever they could obtain shelter; convict servants were usually their\r\ncompanions,--or when their manners were superior to their class,\r\ncorrupters of a higher rank were always at hand to betray or destroy\r\nthem. Reformation has been commonly deemed unattainable, and precautions\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nThe influence of such persons on the tone of society, the temper of\r\nmasters, the morals of children, and even the conduct of the convict\r\nmen, has proved everywhere disastrous, unless checked by incessant\r\nvigilance. Smoking, drinking, swearing, and prostitution, have very\r\ncommonly formed the character ever present to the tender mind. The\r\nstranger entered perhaps a splendid dwelling, and found all the\r\nadvantages of opulence, except what money could not procure--a comely\r\nand honest-hearted woman servant. The eye at length became more familiar\r\nwith lineaments bloated or rigid with passion and debauch, and the ear\r\naccustomed to the endless vicissitudes of the servants' hall, which\r\ndischarged and received an endless succession of the same debased,\r\ndespised, and unhappily despicable beings. The writer has not forgotten,\r\nfor a moment, that under the protection of a virtuous mistress, some\r\nunfortunate but not depraved females have escaped the terrible ordeal,\r\nand have found in the land of their exile the comforts of a home.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: Letter from Chief Justice Forbes, 1836.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXVI.\r\n\r\nLord Stanley devoted commendable and humane attention to the management\r\nof female prisoners. They were comprehended in his scheme of probation.\r\nHe resolved to establish a penitentiary, on a large scale, within twenty\r\nmiles of Hobart Town. The women were to be carefully classified and\r\nseparated, and trained for the duties of domestic life. The discipline\r\nintended rather to restore than to punish: those remitted in disgrace to\r\nthe government, were not to re-enter this place of reform. Instructions\r\nwere forwarded to prepare the ground and collect the material (1843);\r\nbut the local officers were averse to the plan. They complained that the\r\ncontemplated site was remote and inconvenient, and they succeeded in\r\npostponing and finally defeating the project.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bowden, a lady of majestic presence and enlightened mind, who had\r\nacquired considerable experience in the management of the insane, was\r\nappointed matron. Her fertility of resource, courage, and zeal, had been\r\ngreatly admired at Hanwell, where many hundreds of the unfortunate were\r\nrelieved from the greatest of human calamities. The reputation of this\r\nlady recommended her to the confidence of government:[275] with her\r\nhusband, Dr. Bowden, the medical officer, and a chosen staff of\r\nassistants--several only inferior to herself--she arrived in this colony\r\nwith high expectations of success. As a temporary expedient, the\r\n_Anson_, a ship of war, was appropriated to the project. The decorum of\r\nthe ship, and the healthy and cleanly appearance of the women, were\r\nstriking to a stranger; but the early lack of employment ruined the\r\nenterprise. The government, with its usual negligence, failed in\r\ndetails, and thus failed altogether. Towards the close of the\r\nexperiment, the making of clothing for the prisoners was more\r\nsuccessfully attempted; but the local authorities were always hostile to\r\nthe institution. It was protected by Lord Stanley and Mr. Gladstone, but\r\nEarl Grey consented to its extinction. The results were certainly not\r\nencouraging. The women, discharged from the ship ignorant of the colony,\r\nwere at once thrown into every temptation of convict associations. They\r\nhad been instructed in the principles of religion, reading and\r\nneedlework, and the fruit of these labors will hereafter perhaps,\r\nappear; but whoever expects much from mere dogmatic knowledge, will be\r\ndoomed to disappointment. On the death of her husband Mrs. Bowden\r\nreturned to England, convinced that moral insanity is far more hopeless\r\nthan the diseases of Hanwell. This lady and her friends and coadjutors,\r\nthe Misses Holdich, found the women generally submissive and docile:\r\nthey were haunted with all kinds of terrors, and had less than the\r\nordinary courage of women. Mere children in understanding; some, such\r\nonly in years; but their actual reformation, for the most part, only\r\nremained an object of confident expectation, while their true tendencies\r\nwere repressed. The lady officers, who expected to reap a harvest in\r\nthis field of mercy, began by blaming the colonists for scepticism, and\r\nafter 3,000 women had passed through their hands, they, alas! ended in\r\nbecoming sceptical.\r\n\r\nA great number of these prisoners are married. During the probation\r\nsystem, the local government of the colony became far less scrupulous in\r\nreference to their character, previous engagements, and means of living.\r\nAs a choice of evils this course was the least; but many of these\r\nmarriages were a disguise for licentiousness, and of a very temporary\r\ncharacter. The freed man united to a convict woman could not be detained\r\nin the colony; indeed, he was often compelled to leave it, and his wife\r\nwas not permitted to accompany him. From this cause alone, infinite vice\r\nand misery has arisen; and a total disregard of ties so modified by a\r\npolice regulation; which, while encouraging women to marry, subjects\r\nthem to lasting desertion.\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of Lord Stanley's probation system, several\r\npious ladies established a committee of visitation. They entered the\r\nfactories and cells, and conversed with the female prisoners. Official\r\nteachers superseded these efforts of private benevolence; and lessons,\r\nhowever excellent in themselves, lost the attraction of spontaneous\r\nsympathy and disinterested toil.\r\n\r\nIt is with deep regret these observations are recorded. It is not\r\nintended to assume that the reform of female prisoners is impossible. A\r\nconsiderable minority are probably not inferior to the lower classes of\r\npoor and uneducated women in the cities, or more uncivilised provinces.\r\nRe-convictions are not numerous; though, of course, many are deeply\r\nimplicated with colonial crime. The law which consigns all to one penal\r\nfate, devotes all to one common ruin. Were it possible to escape the\r\ncontamination of a gaol, what could be hoped, where the male population\r\nis contributed chiefly by prisons? What can be done to obviate these\r\nevils? Such is the enquiry of the philanthropist: would to God it could\r\nbe successfully answered.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: _Report of Hanwell Institutions_, 1842.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXVII.\r\n\r\nWhatever details are omitted from the foregoing pages, nothing has been\r\nwithheld necessary to complete a colonial view of transportation. Errors\r\nmay doubtless be detected; but as they have not resulted from\r\ncarelessness or haste, it is hoped they will be found both unimportant\r\nand rare.\r\n\r\nThe views expressed by various parties on the subject of transportation\r\nare modified, or even wholly suggested by their interests. The English\r\npeer rejoices that sixteen thousand miles of ocean divide him from the\r\n\"wretch\" who entered on his preserves, or dragged his rivers, and is at\r\nrest; the citizen is glad that one burglar less lives in his\r\nneighbourhood, and considers that transportation is indispensible to the\r\nsafety of plate. The colonist farmer regards convictism as a labor\r\npower; the working emigrant as a rival labor market; while the officers\r\nin charge naturally cloak its evils and exalt its efficacy.\r\n\r\nIt is nearly impossible for a stranger to estimate the weight of\r\ntestimony, so prejudiced throughout, and nearly as impossible for a\r\nwriter, interested in the issue of its discussion, to preserve the\r\nunclouded judgment required to arrive at truth. But little reliance can\r\nbe placed on official statistics: they give imperfect views of moral or\r\nindustrial results. They have often been compiled by government for\r\nspecific purposes, or by agents unworthy of confidence.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to point out the chief difficulties which beset this\r\nbranch of penal jurisprudence. Some of these have been long noticed by\r\nauthorities on political philosophy. From Paley, to the latest\r\nspeculators on transportation, all have noticed its inequality. They\r\nhave dwelt on the uncertainty of its details--from the differing habits\r\nand original condition of those subject to its infliction; and from the\r\nabsence of supervision, only to be expected where those who direct the\r\nsentence secure its observance. The convict is condemned to a penalty\r\nwhich may subject him to predial slavery, to capricious punishments; to\r\nbrutal taskmasters, and to the antipathies of a caste; or he may be\r\nregarded with compassion, good-will, and even preference: the sting of\r\nthe law may be taken away, and what was a penalty may constitute a\r\nbrotherhood.\r\n\r\nThus it happens that no uniform description is a true one. What may\r\ncorrectly delineate the aspect of transportation on one class, may be\r\nfalse in reference to another; what may be facts one year, may be an\r\nexaggeration in the year following. This inequality has been partly the\r\nresult of the law. The relation of the convict to the free has been\r\nconstantly changing. He was a bond servant; he was permitted to compound\r\nhis servitude by a daily payment; he was allowed to work partly for\r\nhimself and partly for the crown, at the same moment. He has been\r\nrestrained in government gangs; he has lodged in barracks, and worn the\r\ncoarsest dress, or he has lived in his own hired house. Sometimes\r\ntreated as a public enemy, chained, flogged, and over-worked; at others,\r\npetted as a favorite or soothed like a child.\r\n\r\nThe public policy has depended on causes which have had little relation\r\nto the individual character of convicts. A mild or severe governor, or\r\nsecretary of state; a great increase or decrease of numbers; the book of\r\nsome literary idler, or of an angry colonist; instances of extraordinary\r\ngood fortune, or an insurrection against tyranny; the fluctuations of\r\nfeeling at home, sometimes wrath against crime, sometimes compassion for\r\nthe criminal. Such are the causes, traced in the incessant agitation of\r\npenal transportation.\r\n\r\nTwo incompatible objects have been always professedly\r\nembraced--intimidation and reform; but while they have both animated the\r\nscheme, they have struggled for the ascendancy, and the one or the other\r\nhas seemed to be the chief, if not sole, motive of government. The\r\nAustralian seal expressed the design of mercy: it was to oxen\r\nploughing--to bales of merchandise, and the various attributes of\r\nindustry, that Hope pointed the landing convict, when she broke off his\r\nbonds. Fifty years after, Lord Stanley deemed many years spent in\r\nchains, a just punishment for crimes against property, or others of no\r\ndeep dye.\r\n\r\nThe changes of systems have been usually based on facts and opinions,\r\nelicited during those paroxysms of reform which occur generally once in\r\nten years. Thus the improvement of discipline; the efficiency of convict\r\nlabor; the several efforts to restrain its attendant vices; have\r\nusually occurred when some old officer has been superseded; and others\r\nhave devoted to their novel duties the first vigour of their zeal.\r\n\r\nThe whole spirit and apparent object of convict discipline has been\r\nrevolutionised several times. In the vicissitudes of English factions a\r\nnew secretary of state has had power to sift and overturn the expedients\r\nof a rival. It has rarely remained beyond a few months in one stay. For\r\nfour or six years, during the governorship of Colonel Arthur,\r\ntransportation reached its highest perfection. It was rendered uniform,\r\nby the imperial confidence reposed in his judgment; more so by the\r\ndemand for labor, by the rapid influx of capital, and by the common\r\ninterest of the government, the colonist, and the well-doing prisoner.\r\nIt would be difficult to find half that period undisturbed under any\r\nother ruler.\r\n\r\nMany difficulties connected with transportation are created by natural\r\nand social laws: full of mercy to the human race. The sufferings\r\ninflicted by man cannot reform man: he cannot carry out the vengeance of\r\nanother, for wrongs he neither endured nor saw. His heart melts at the\r\nsight of distress, and forgetting general principles, says, in the\r\nabsence of accusers, \"neither do I condemn thee;\" or if forgetful of a\r\ncommon nature, he punishes with inflexible severity, while the iron\r\nenters the soul of his brother his own heart is seared. Thus, again, a\r\nnation cannot send away her criminals, and yet make their punishment\r\nexemplary; she cannot detain them in masses, without rendering them a\r\nscourge; she cannot discharge them to live under a clement sky and\r\namidst abundance, without meeting everywhere the reproaches of the\r\nhonest poor. Thus beset on every side, she is taught that crime is not\r\nan excrescence to be cut off, but a disease to be cured; and that to\r\nincrease the comparative penalty of guilt, more than liberty must be\r\nforfeited. She must offer something better to her paupers than the\r\nbenefits of disgraceful exile.\r\n\r\nIn reference to practical results, almost every theory may be sustained\r\nby the records of transportation, if one class of facts only are\r\nadmitted into view. Thus it has been pronounced by men distinguished and\r\nintelligent, as an expedient worthy an enlightened statesman, and\r\ngratifying to the most ardent though scrupulous philanthropist; but they\r\nhave often omitted sections of facts which, resting on evidence not less\r\ndeserving regard, excite astonishment, disgust, and horror.\r\n\r\nWhether the judgment of Governor Arthur was correct on the main\r\nquestion, or not, he doubtless pointed out the great difficulty. His\r\nwords are well worthy remembrance:--\"Sanguine as I am of the beneficial\r\nresults of transportation, and confident as I feel that it may be made\r\nto surpass any other secondary punishment, both as relates to the\r\ncriminal and to the country from which he is banished,--I cannot lose\r\nsight of many imperfections of our present system, some of which are\r\nbottomed on a state of things which no human ingenuity can\r\nrectify:--'you cannot make that straight which God hath made\r\ncrooked.'\"[276]\r\n\r\nA few men of the generation survive, which witnessed the departure of\r\nthe first fleet of convict vessels to a country then a wilderness, and\r\ninhabited only by savages. The stranger, who lands where they first\r\npitched their tents, will survey the scene and consider the question of\r\ntransportation determined. The shipping which crowd the harbour; the\r\npublic and private buildings rivaling the architecture of Europe; the\r\nspacious churches, filled with well-dressed families; the extensive\r\nthoroughfare, thronged with business and equipages, and adorned with\r\nelegant shops and offices; the courts of law; the public markets; the\r\nLondon cries; the noise of the hustings; the debates of the assembly.\r\nSuch are the alleged results of transportation: as if by some vast\r\neffort the people of an old country had transferred the seat of empire,\r\nand were collecting all that art could devise and wealth could bring.\r\nShould the visitor extend his enquiries, he will find vessels trading to\r\nmany neighbouring and kindred cities. They all owe their existence to\r\nthat first fleet. Sometimes they repudiate their origin; but they bear\r\nevidence that their giant youth has learned from the experience, and\r\nrisen in part under the auspices of the great convict country. Should\r\nthe traveller extend his travels to Van Diemen's Land, he will hear the\r\nsame tale of penal transportation, and its wondrous effects in former\r\ntimes. He will pass over a road made after scientific plans, and bridges\r\nof costly structure. He will see orchards, in which mingle the blossom\r\nof the cherry, the apple, the pear, and the peach; and gardens green\r\nwith British vegetation. This successful spread of the English name,\r\nlanguage, commerce, and power, has required less than the life of man.\r\nMany survive, who were born when the first sod of Australia was turned\r\nby the hoe of a banished Briton. The man even now seen sauntering\r\nalong, chained and moving sullenly to labor, is but a continuation of\r\nthat army who first broke in on the solitude of a new world; laid the\r\nfirst foundation, and planted the first field.\r\n\r\nShould the traveller still extend his enquiry, his astonishment and\r\ndelight will not be diminished. The swarms of children rushing from a\r\nvillage school participate the blood of men, some of whom were once a\r\nterror to society, or of women who were its reproach. In the lists of\r\nreligious societies, commercial companies, jurors, magistrates, will be\r\nfound traces of their lineage. What could hope have anticipated beyond\r\nthese realities!\r\n\r\nBut the connection between these successes and transportation, is rather\r\nco-incidental than of cause and effect. Were it supposed that seventy\r\nyears would have elapsed prior to the occupation of these countries, but\r\nfor transportation, the advantage must be calculated not by actual\r\nachievements but the value of that advanced starting point, which\r\ncolonisation now possesses. It is not improbable that colonisation would\r\nhave commenced at a much earlier date: the first ships of free settlers\r\nwould have been more intelligent; their attention to the resources of\r\nthe country more earnest. The second quarter of a century had half\r\nexpired, when the Blue Mountains ceased to be a barrier to the colonists\r\nof New South Wales. The dawning of a new world must have attracted the\r\nnational mind, had not an unexampled society, abandoned to vice and\r\ncrime, appeared to the people an object of dread and horror.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the colonies, until 1830, cannot be considered rapid.\r\nThe first settlers were, individually, prosperous: many emancipists were\r\nwealthy; but for the rest, their houses were mean, their commercial\r\narrangements pedling and insignificant; their public buildings generally\r\nmiserable. It is from the date of emigration that progress has been\r\nconspicuous: and that date is but recent--a progress in a ratio vastly\r\ngreater than any previous cycle. The great colonies of Port Phillip and\r\nSouth Australia, before that time, were hardly in existence.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, no capital had been introduced; no whalers collected the\r\ntreasures of the deep; no free emigrant arrived; no free colonies\r\nerected; then the improvements of this quarter of the globe might be\r\nascribed to penal laws; but they have the same relation to its present\r\nprosperity as the numerous parts of an edifice have to each other--not\r\nsuch as of the oak to the acorn. When, therefore, it is stated that\r\ntransportation has been the making of these colonies, it should be\r\nrather said it was the cause of their establishment. The outlay of the\r\ncrown, although great, has been small compared with the outlay of the\r\npeople. The chief settlers of the convict colonies were capitalists;\r\nthey gave themselves to cultivation, which, in most instances, has\r\ninvolved them. Agriculturists are poor: it is the shepherd prince who is\r\nrich. He may be benefited a few score pounds by labor artificially\r\nsupplied; but nature is the great patron of his house.\r\n\r\nThe chief connexion between transportation and progress is in the\r\ngovernment outlay; but that has been less than apparent; it has often\r\nbeen the mere difference between an English and a colonial price; it has\r\nbeen attended with great consumption without equal re-production. It has\r\nsometimes had no other effect than foreign commerce on the places of\r\ndepot and transit. The price of labor, when labor was chiefly supplied\r\nby transportation, was often very high. Thus a farmer found one man with\r\nrations and clothing; but a person, working in the same field, received\r\nL30, L40, or even L60 per annum. The price of labor was therefore often,\r\non the whole, sufficient to absorb the capital of the employer.\r\n\r\nThere are many wealthy landowners, who are, however, the sole\r\nrepresentatives of those numerous fortunes lost by London firms in these\r\ncolonies. The court of insolvency made that which was foreign, colonial\r\nproperty. The rich freights sent from Europe, when not wasted by an\r\nextravagant consumption, were really exchanged for land improved, and\r\nfinally disappeared from the ledger of the merchant. It remains--not as\r\nthe result of convict labor, but as the dividend of an expenditure which\r\nshews more loss than gain.\r\n\r\nThe value of convict labor has been generally overestimated. \"The day\r\nthat sees a man a slave, deprives him of half his worth.\" The employers,\r\nas a class, are uniformly poor. Slave labor in America is dearer than\r\nfree, although it implies no moral degradation.[277] What then could be\r\nexpected from bondmen of the same colour as their lords; whose\r\nresentment and indolence combined to prevent their usefulness. It may be\r\nsafely affirmed, that the employer who gained by his servants, not only\r\nwatched, but paid them.[278] Instances may be found in opposition to\r\nthis conclusion: the great employers, who reduced their men by an\r\nunrelenting pressure, were few in number; and their advantages were of\r\nbrief duration.[279]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary settlers purchased convict labor at great sacrifices, which\r\nthey never estimated. They lived in woods, often without religious\r\ninstruction, medical attendance, and in want of those refinements which\r\ncan be realised only when the stern features of the wilderness are\r\nsoftened by neighbourhood and civilisation. Who can value the toil and\r\ntime, and wear and tear of life, in bringing the stubborn, ignorant, and\r\nvicious to drive the plough and reap the harvest. Other colonists, in\r\nother lands, with less capital, but with free labor, have thriven\r\nfaster; and attained a prosperity far less compromised by debt, and far\r\nmore durable.\r\n\r\nA very great quantity of property has been destroyed by crime and vice.\r\nIt is commonly said that theft merely changes ownership, and does not\r\ndetract from the aggregate of wealth; but the thief is not only idle,\r\nhis expenditure is reckless; he wastes more than he consumes.\r\n\r\nMany colonists of former years spoke of the arrival of prisoners with\r\ngladness, and seemed to regard the punctual supply of a certain but\r\nincreasing number as a boon. The minds of these persons usually dwelt\r\nsolely on the advantage of coercive labor, of military and prison\r\nexpenditure, and the prisoner was regarded as a \"productive power.\"\r\nWhen ashamed of sordid calculation, they discovered a defence in the\r\nblessedness of expatriation to the offender. His food was greater in\r\nquantity, and better in quality, than he could obtain by industry in a\r\ncrowded country. His liberty restored, fortune became often auspicious,\r\nand the temptation, to rude roguery ceased. He took his side with the\r\nlaws; he married, and educated his children; he attended the house of\r\nGod, and became serious; he rivalled his master in liberality and public\r\nspirit. Multitudes died in hospitals and in prisons; but they were\r\nforgotten, and the fortunate only were conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe public works performed by convict labor, though sometimes extensive\r\nand important, will appear inconsiderable, if compared with the imperial\r\nor colonial cost. The deep cuts and massive bridges, which please the\r\neye, are yet disproportionate to the traffic, and produce no adequate\r\nreturn. The proportion between free and bond labor, is as 2 and 3 to 1.\r\nTask labor has been commonly found incompatible with discipline, or\r\nliable to favoritism and official dishonesty: the overseer\r\n\"approximates\" or guesses, when not inclined to reckon. Day work is\r\nstill less satisfactory: the pick is slowly uplifted, and descends\r\nwithout effect. The body bends and goes through hours of ineffectual\r\nmotion; or if the rigour of discipline renders evasion penal, the\r\ntriangles disgrace a civilised nation, and the colony is filled with\r\nviolence and vengeance. Yet convict labor has, generally, been deemed\r\nimportant to an infant settlement; to secure a combination, without\r\nwhich preliminary stages of colonisation are slowly passed. Such has\r\nbeen its undoubted use; but who, with the prodigies of modern enterprise\r\nbefore him, will assign to bond labor a peculiar efficacy, or doubt that\r\nwell directed capital can ensure all that force can effect.\r\n\r\nThe industrial enterprises of the crown have been utterly unsuccessful:\r\nthey have been the laughter of the colony. Examples might be given in\r\nabundance; but it is needless to prove what has been never disputed.\r\nConvicts have been employed by the authorities as ship-builders, masons,\r\nhop-growers, and cultivators; but the general results would have\r\ninvolved any less opulent proprietor in ruin.\r\n\r\nNearly 120,000 prisoners have landed in these colonies; of these, the\r\nmajor part have passed into eternity. Thousands have died in chains;\r\nthousands and tens of thousands perished by strong drink. Their domestic\r\nincrease, compared with equal numbers of free persons, is\r\ninsignificant--partly by the effects of vice, and in part by the\r\nimpracticability of marriage: they melt from the earth, and pass away\r\nlike a mournful dream. In every parochial burial-ground there is a large\r\nsection of graves, where not a tomb records who slumber there.\r\n\r\nThe nursery is the natural hive of arts and agriculture. The sons of the\r\nfarmer, when they commit him to the dust, occupy his fields, and the\r\nlittle one becomes a thousand. There are several families in this\r\ncolony, more than were the sons of Jacob when he lodged in Goshen; but\r\nconvicts, for the most part, die childless.\r\n\r\nIn delineating the character of an exile population, a broad line must\r\nbe drawn between the accidental offender and the hereditary robber. To\r\nthe first no special description will be applicable: they are often not\r\ninferior to the ranks from which they sprung. Though a small section of\r\nthe whole, they present not the least affecting picture among the many\r\nsad sights of a penal land. In the folly and recklessness of youth they\r\nlost at once their fame, their honor, and their freedom. The statesman\r\nmay behold only a mass of outcasts; but among them are many whose names\r\nare the burden of a father's prayer, or are traced in deep lines of\r\nsorrow on a mother's breaking heart.\r\n\r\nTransportation confounds men of entirely distinct character in one\r\ncommon penalty. Thus every variety of disposition, and every grade in\r\nlife may be discovered. A proportion, certainly not considerable, obtain\r\nthe respect and influence due to benevolence, integrity, successful\r\ntoil: a much larger number exhibit only the common faults of uneducated\r\nmen, and acquire the common confidence suited to their original station.\r\n\r\nThe character of convicts cannot be safely inferred from their sentence.\r\nThus highway robbers were not unfrequently the best conducted men: they\r\nexhibited a courage and resolution which, directed aright, became useful\r\nto society and to themselves. The petty thief, often detected in his\r\nleast offence, proved incapable of shame or gratitude. To an English\r\nreader, preference expressed by masters for persons under heavy\r\nsentences, would appear inexplicable; but it was founded, not on length\r\nof servitude alone, but a not uncommon superiority of disposition. Those\r\ntransported for agrarian offences and political crimes, were often\r\nhonest men. The rustic insurgents of 1832, were considered valuable\r\nservants. The Canadian prisoners conducted themselves with exemplary\r\ndecorum.\r\n\r\nAmong those who belong to the class of habitual offenders, a large\r\nproportion are intellectually deficient. These unfortunate beings\r\nregularly return to crime on their discharge; incapable of resisting\r\ntemptation: while prisoners, they are perpetually involved in\r\ndifficulties. A very bad man will pass through the different stages of\r\nhis sentence without reproach, while the weak-minded are involved in\r\nendless infractions of discipline and successive punishments. Nothing\r\nretards the release of the artful villain when his time is expired,\r\nwhile the warm and incautious, but better man, accumulates a catalogue\r\nof prison penalties.\r\n\r\nThe most civil and useless prisoners are the Irish: the most base and\r\nclever are the Scotch. They stand in different relations to the law: the\r\nScotchman violates his own judgment, and offends, against knowledge; the\r\nIrish peasant unites a species of patriotism with his aggressions.\r\n\r\nThe modern convict is, in some respects, better than his predecessor;\r\nless ruthless, or prone to atrocious violence. Civilisation has extended\r\nits mollifying influence, even to the professional robber. On the other\r\nhand, in former times, men were transported for very trivial offences:\r\npoaching, with its consequences, formed the leading crimes of the\r\nEnglish counties; yet many poachers were otherwise first-rate men, both\r\nin disposition and physical development. The modern convicts are, more\r\ngenerally, criminals in the popular sense. The abolition of capital\r\npunishments, and the erection of penitentiaries at home, left the\r\npenalty of transportation chiefly to more serious offences.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to particular crimes is often curiously displayed.\r\nPrisoners are safe amidst scenes which present no allurements adapted to\r\ntheir former habits: the pickpocket is perfectly trusty as a shepherd;\r\nthe housebreaker makes a confidential dairy-man. Old temptations are\r\nfatal: even the stealing particular goods seems a special propensity. A\r\nwoman, lately convicted of stealing blankets, who was originally\r\ntransported for blanket-stealing, had twice stolen the same article in\r\nthe colony. It is, of course, in the same department that the robber,\r\nthe coiner, or the receiver of Europe, resumes in Australia his\r\nantagonism to the laws. These characteristics are happily often\r\nobliterated and overpowered.\r\n\r\nThe Christian will not doubt that reformation is possible, and that many\r\nonce neglected and unfortunate, placed under the guidance and encouraged\r\nby the countenance of benevolent men, acquire both the principles and\r\nhabits of ordinary society. The affections of domestic life are all\r\nawakened. The parent feels a new interest in the world: his share in the\r\ncommon prosperity excites the sentiment of patriotism. He promotes his\r\nchildren's education with unusual care; but it is at this stage of life\r\nthat his heart endures a pang which legislators never contemplated.\r\n\r\nThe occasional prosperity of the transported person has been the\r\nopprobrium of the laws. He rises above his former condition; becomes a\r\nmaster where he was a bondman; patronises public amusements, and rides\r\nin his chariot past the pedestrian who received him in bonds. Great\r\nchanges in condition are common everywhere: but transportation presents\r\nthe whole career of the exile, from the bar to the civic hall, as parts\r\nof the one drama. A pardoned offender is lost in the population of Great\r\nBritain. Were the changes in his fortune noticed, it would occasion no\r\nreflection on the laws; but when numbers ascend under the same auspices,\r\ntheir prosperity is flagrant, and stands in ludicrous contrast with the\r\npredictions of the magistrate, who opened up a field of successful\r\nenterprise when he pronounced the sentence of transportation.\r\n\r\nThe colonial aspect of transportation is, to a British statesman, a\r\nsecondary question: thus the injury of a distant community is of\r\ninconsiderable importance. If the expatriated classes carry out with\r\nthem their ignorance, disorder, and crime, they retard the progress and\r\ndestroy the reputation of a distant country, but the nation may still be\r\nsatisfied: she may balance the evil and the good, and find herself the\r\ngainer. The colony is injured; but the parent country is saved. Thus\r\ntransportation not only removes the habitual criminal, it extinguishes\r\nthe embers of insurrection: it prevents the dreaded war between property\r\nand poverty, and silently withdraws a mass of dangerous discontent.\r\n\r\nOf those transported a great proportion, if in England, would be in\r\nprisons; or, if at large, preying on the world--following their old\r\ncalling, as burglars, coiners, and sheep-stealers. They would be active\r\nincendiaries and anarchists: they would be out at every riot, and by\r\nthrowing their numbers into the scale of sedition, overturn all order,\r\nand even change the constitution. Such have been the conclusions of\r\nEnglish statesmen: perhaps, partly founded on their fears, or stated for\r\neffect; but not wholly unsupported by analogy.\r\n\r\nWhile some exhibit a convict colony as depraved beyond all examples of\r\ndepravation, others lower the standard of human virtue, and not only\r\nextenuate its evils but magnify its worth. It was asserted by Lord\r\nStanley, that the feeling of caste guarded the habits of the free. A\r\nview so flattering to human pride could hardly fail to be confessed;\r\nbut, in fact, familiarity with crime, although it may not corrupt the\r\njudgment, must abate the moral sensibility. No colonist can forget his\r\nshudder at the first spectacle of men in chains: none can be unconscious\r\nthat the lapse of years has deadened the sense of social disorder. It\r\nhas, indeed, made many doubly circumspect, and awakened a peculiar\r\ninterest in the ordinances of religion. Nor is it to be doubted that\r\nmany expirees, disgusted with the enormities of vice, have, under the\r\nsame feeling, contributed to set up the indispensable land-marks of\r\nhonesty and religion.\r\n\r\nNever were families guarded with more care, or efforts to educate the\r\npopulation more earnest, than during the inundation of the probation\r\nsystem. The external decorum of the Sabbath, the general attendance of\r\nthe free inhabitants on worship, would go far to countenance the idea\r\nthat the place of peril is the place of caution and prayer.\r\n\r\nMinisters of the crown are, or profess to be, astonished that when the\r\nfreed population increases, and the territory is explored, a country,\r\nstill needing labor, should object to the prisoner supply; but the\r\nslave-holding interest expires, when immense numbers can be held no\r\nlonger by a few: the common views of mankind re-assert their ascendancy.\r\nAll, save employers, are hostile to degraded labor; employers themselves\r\nbecome less interested as masters than as colonists.\r\n\r\nBut transportation to one country cannot continue for ever. The causes\r\nwhich suggest the exile of offenders will occasion their rejection:\r\nmoney or labor may bribe the settler to become an overseer for the\r\ncrown; but from the beginning he will calculate on a nobler vocation. A\r\nconsiderable community cannot be tempted by convict labor: and the\r\nnumbers who regain liberty are enemies to the social state they have\r\nescaped. Fathers, who for themselves dreaded no dangers, tremble for\r\ntheir children: the adventurer becomes a citizen; a merchant, a\r\npolitician: and the time approaches, when the same causes which induced\r\nthe parent country to send the first convict vessel, will impel the\r\ncolony to send back the last.\r\n\r\nThe late expedient of Earl Grey, is the trial of a scheme long present\r\nbefore his imagination.[280] Its rejection by the Australian continent\r\nhas limited the experiment to Van Diemen's Land, where resistance is\r\nunavailing. It is the last achievement of penal philosophy, and will\r\nascertain how long one small portion of the earth can receive the\r\nliberated masses, gathered by the penal laws of a mighty empire!\r\n\r\nThe ticket man lands; the colony is crowded with his predecessors; the\r\ncolonists consider his arrival a grievance; the government, ignorant or\r\ncareless of his fate, cast him into new temptations. Under such a plan\r\nthe emigrant is gradually superseded by the exile population: the\r\nemancipated laborer is expelled by a fresh ticket holder. The\r\ncountry-born youth finds himself unable to live in his native land. The\r\ntone of public morals follows the prevailing spirit: crime is currently\r\nspoken of merely as a fault or a misfortune; the press teams with\r\nvicious sentimentalism; the administration of justice becomes more\r\nuncertain, perjury more common; the reputation of the colony is formed\r\nfrom the census, and the land becomes a by-word and a hissing.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the scheme which originated in philanthropy; such the\r\npractical result of years of laborious inquiry and official debate!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: Despatch of Colonel Arthur to Right. Hon. E. G.

The events\r\nrecorded in these volumes represent the policy, modified slightly, which\r\nhas everywhere prevailed. The author has however rarely attempted\r\ngeneralization, and has represented every fact in its independent\r\ncolors. Thus an evil pursued to its source might have been avoidable by\r\ngreater forethought and care, or it may have been the inevitable issue\r\nof a system upon the whole beneficial and therefore just.\r\n\r\nFor many years the government of these colonies was absolute: could it\r\nbe otherwise? A company of exiles, overawed by dissolute soldiery,\r\ninterspersed here and there with few persons of a superior class, could\r\nonly be governed by despotism. It might have been legalised instead of\r\ntolerated by the parliament, and it might have been less offensive to\r\nthe spirit of liberty. But to have trusted a few proprietors with\r\nlegislation or a share of the executive authority, could have only\r\ncreated a tyranny more grievous.\r\n\r\nThe comparison between the early colonists of America, at least those of\r\nthe northern states, and the founders of Australia, must quickly run off\r\ninto a contrast. The primary object of the Pilgrim Fathers, was the\r\nenjoyment of opinions in peace. The early denizens of the southern world\r\nburned their first church to escape the tedium of attendance. The first\r\npilgrims of New England attempted a community of goods on the plan of\r\nthe apostles. The first Australians drew their stores from the\r\ncommissariat, and adopted the traditions of Houndsditch and Wapping. The\r\nleaders of the first Americans were their clergy,--the bible was their\r\npolitical and civil standard. The rulers of the first Australians were\r\nhalf marine, half soldiers, whose pay was supplemented by the sale of\r\nspirits sold by convict women, their mistresses. Thus for many years\r\nthe government of these colonies was absolute, and the usual\r\nconsequences sometimes appeared.\r\n\r\nWere a judgment to be formed however of the spirit of colonial\r\ngovernment by a severe examination of its early frame-work, erroneous\r\nconclusions would be drawn. In the worst times the sentiments and habits\r\nof Englishmen tempered the operation of power. Settlers fresh from\r\nEnglish society could not discard the opinions and principles cherished\r\nin Great Britain; nor could the rulers of the day forget that their\r\nconduct would be judged, not by the standard of continental despotisms,\r\nbut by British systems of government. The establishment of British\r\ncourts of justice and the protection of English laws have been found\r\nwith few exceptions an impenetrable shield. The chief examples of\r\nofficial wrong have been generally connected with the misappropriation\r\nof public resources rather than invasions of personal liberty. How\r\ndifferent the despotism of a Spanish viceroy and the sternest rule of a\r\nBritish governor! For the last twenty years cases of aggravated\r\noppression have been exceedingly rare. The genius of British freedom has\r\never overshadowed the British colony, and awed the despotic ruler, while\r\nit has encouraged and sheltered the feeblest colonist. The great defect\r\nin official men has been their superciliousness and indolence, rather\r\nthan their tyranny, and the popular governors of this hemisphere have\r\ngained the public esteem by their manners rather than their ability. A\r\ngenial temper and a feeling heart rarely failed to conciliate the\r\nmultitude, while distinguished talents have lost their immediate\r\ninfluence when in union with a harsh, contemptuous, and fiery\r\nspirit.[281]\r\n\r\nFor many years the press has exercised a powerful influence on the\r\naffairs of government, and left no avenue of escape to official\r\nignorance and corruption. Even when jurors were selected by governors,\r\nthe most unmeasured denunciations were poured forth without fear of\r\nprosecution. Associations for the redress of grievances have carried\r\ntheir organizations to the very verge of constitutional order. A\r\ndemocratic state certainly would never have tolerated the discussion of\r\nits principles and authority in feeble dependencies. But the British\r\ngovernment, secure in its power and serenely conscious of its ability to\r\ncheck an intrusion on its just authority, has encouraged rather than\r\nrepressed the freedom of public discussion and combination. The local\r\nrulers, instructed by their superiors, have long permitted even the\r\nlicentiousness of the press. The strength of the empire justified and\r\naccounted for its tolerance. There is no tyranny so watchful as that of\r\nfear, and no cruelty so relentless as that of factions who struggle for\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe non-dependence of the government on the people has united the\r\ncolonists in one body. It has been the colony against England, and not\r\ntories against whigs. In America the powers of self-government were too\r\noften seized by a faction, and a political opposition, even in a most\r\nmoderate form, was stigmatised as felony and punished as treason. But in\r\nthe Australias the colonists have expended their rage on a distant\r\noffice, and in their real or imaginary sufferings have felt a sympathy\r\nfor each other. The ascendancy of a faction in a small community is the\r\nreign of terror, and might soon lead those who value their personal\r\nfreedom to regret the most sensitive and unscrupulous vice-regal\r\ndespotism.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of colonial government, however, has been sensibly affected\r\nby the policy of Great Britain. The enlargement of popular freedom at\r\nhome has relaxed the severity of colonial rule. For every considerable\r\namelioration the colony has been indebted to the whigs. They gave trial\r\nby jury: they stopped white slavery in the Australian colonies, and thus\r\nin the end transportation. They placed religious denominations on an\r\nequal footing: they introduced the sale of land, for the purposes of\r\nimmigration: they granted first to New South Wales, and since to all the\r\ncolonies, the legislative assemblies which now watch over their rising\r\nliberties. In the days of a Castlereagh or a Bathurst, England possessed\r\nfar less practical freedom than her colonies now enjoy. It is impossible\r\nto prevent the contagion of opinions, and the colonies may see in the\r\ngrowing intelligence and spirit of the United Kingdom the assurance of\r\ntheir own gradual advancement in the ranks of freedom. In this respect\r\nAustralia is more happily conditioned than was once her American sister.\r\nThe colonies of that continent were in advance of the parent country.\r\nThe royal government not only detested their institutions as democratic,\r\nbut as a standing reproach to the maxims of domestic policy. Thus, the\r\nappearance of a royal governor was ominous to their liberties. He came\r\nto entrap, to report, and to betray them. They had to hide their\r\ncharters, to preserve them from violent abduction; and to threaten\r\ninsurrection as the alternative of liberty. Whatever Australasia gains\r\nshe will attain with the approbation of English statesmen. She will look\r\nto the spirit of the times as the guardian of her rights. While\r\nprivileged exclusiveness is in Great Britain crumbling to the dust, it\r\ncannot be that the middle classes will impose upon the necks of infant\r\ncolonies the burdens they themselves abhor.\r\n\r\nIn seeking the improvement of colonial government, a prudent colonist\r\nwill guard against the extravagance of theory. It is true that the\r\npeople are the best judges of their own interests, but not that the\r\ninterests of all colonists are uniform, or that they are capable of\r\nimpartially disposing of all the incipient interests of the colonial\r\nstate. Their covetousness as landholders might absorb the inheritance of\r\nthe nation--their ambition as citizens contract the franchises of the\r\nhumbler classes. The most strenuous opponents of Downing-street have\r\ndenounced most fiercely the extension of the popular power. Mr.\r\nWentworth, whose services in the cause of Australian freedom have\r\nimmortalized his name, is yet a lictor when he turns towards the\r\nmultitude, and a tribune only when he faces the seat of authority. His\r\ndefiance of Earl Grey was pronounced nearly the same time that he\r\nimprecated vengeance on the Sydney democracy. The most strenuous\r\neducated advocates of self-government are not yet prepared to carry out\r\ntheir principles to their utmost limits. If the people have reason to\r\ndislike the autocracy of Downing-street, they would find no amelioration\r\nin the ascendency of an oligarchy which would divide the universe into\r\nsheep walks for the benefit of flockmasters, and convert the residue of\r\nmankind into shepherds. True liberty is a compromise, and if a small\r\ncommunity would prevent faction from establishing a tyranny, it must\r\nexchange some advantages for a control which defends while it restrains.\r\nThus the claim of responsible government, and the appointment of\r\nofficers chosen from the colonial ranks, though favorite projects, and\r\ncertain finally to prevail, require a considerable growth before they\r\ncould be useful. Our functionaries hold their office at the pleasure of\r\nthe crown and thus survive the confidence of the assemblies; but evils\r\nof another class would issue from an opposite system. Official men,\r\nalways fearful of defeat, would strengthen their position by the most\r\ndesperate use of their power, and a dozen voices would decide. Thus\r\nfamily compacts would be formed, and cliques and cabals would finally\r\ndetermine the distribution of office. For this the Americans have found\r\na remedy in the meagre pay of those who occupy their highest situations.\r\nAmbition is moderated by its unrequited toils, and the public business\r\nchiefly carried on by paid servants of humble designations. But were\r\nthousands a year the prize of a successful opposition, not better men,\r\nbut worse than the nominees of the crown might be expected to climb or\r\ncreep into the seat of government.\r\n\r\nIn looking down the lists of colonists who have most largely benefited\r\ntheir adopted country many would be found who were appointed from home\r\nto fill offices they have long since quitted. Nor would it be just to\r\ndeny that they have largely contributed to whatever has elevated the\r\ntaste and improved the social condition of these countries. For some\r\ntime to come the appointment of well-educated Englishmen, though not to\r\nthe exclusion of Australians, would be desirable, unless the recent\r\ndiscovery of gold should rapidly augment the population, and thus extend\r\nthe basis of government and the number from which its officers may be\r\nchosen. The feelings of the colonists have, indeed, been too often\r\nviolated by the scandalous multiplication of offices and the utter\r\nincompetence of those who have filled them. But a community little more\r\nthan half a century old cannot be entitled to denounce Englishmen as\r\nforeigners, or to complain that strangers usurp the rights of the\r\ncountry-born. A wise administration of local patronage, without\r\ndistinctions which are unnatural and absurd, would strengthen the hands\r\nof the executive and satisfy the reason of the people.\r\n\r\nThe future independence of the Australian colonies is written in the\r\nbook of fate; but the inevitable change may be long postponed with\r\nadvantage to themselves. A superior power is desirable to regulate their\r\ndevelopment, and to preserve at once their order and their freedom. The\r\nreins of government, if snatched from vice-regal hands, would not\r\nimmediately fall into those more worthy. The love of order is too strong\r\nin the English breast to tolerate anarchy, and whatever changes\r\ntranspire the public voice would pronounce in favor of a strong and\r\nregular administration. But since life is short, no wise man would wish\r\nto waste a considerable portion in passing through the disorders of a\r\nrevolution to gain the mere name of a State. The royal government may\r\nredress every grievance, and the colonist may turn with confidence to\r\nthe seat of empire for the accomplishment of every municipal change\r\nrequisite to advance the country of his adoption. But were independence\r\ndesirable in itself, the colonists would, notwithstanding, calculate\r\nits cost. Those who have pretended that England does not prize her\r\ncolonies, know little of her temper: her colonies are her pride, her\r\nornament, and her strength. One day she will lose them; but that day\r\nwill be a day of mourning and humiliation.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of this question by the metropolitan press, and the\r\npredictions of parliamentary statesmen, have induced many ardent minds\r\nto anticipate an early realization. These prophecies are but the weapons\r\nof party which would disappear in the presence of real danger; one voice\r\nwould be heard proclaiming the rights of Great Britain. To her power\r\nwhat could Australia at present oppose? The American revolutionists had\r\nan army: they had thrust out the Indians and beaten the French, and\r\ntheir national character was deepened by the political and religious\r\nsentiments in which they had been cradled. But Australia has not a\r\nsoldier or a gun. Her population may quickly reach the three millions\r\nnumbered by the Americans at the era of independence; but she has not\r\nthe habits of Americans--she has not their country, their forests, their\r\nfrozen rivers, their terrible snows. England, when America resisted,\r\nhired a few German troops to assist her own feeble army. Since then she\r\nhas conquered Napoleon, subdued India, and established her military\r\npower in every region of the world. Whether the mutual interests of\r\nGreat Britain and her colonies are sufficient to bind them together may\r\nbe a question at issue. Independence may be desired; but it is well to\r\nremember that those who will attain it must fight for it, and that in\r\nthis war they will not only contend with the most benign and just, but\r\nwith the most powerful government on the earth. England will not permit\r\nher ministers to oppress the colonies; but would hazard the last\r\nregiment rather than lose the colonial empire.\r\n\r\nThe British government will not, if wise, rely on any abstract\r\nprinciples of loyalty, or conclude too confidently that no attempt will\r\nbe successful. The distance of the central power; the peculiar structure\r\nof colonial societies; the mountainous regions of Van Diemen's Land and\r\nNew Holland, where small bodies could resist all the armies of the\r\nworld; the possibility of foreign sympathy: all these are considerations\r\nproper to moderate imperial confidence, and to teach that the integrity\r\nof the empire is only safe in the unity of interest and affection.[282]\r\n\r\nThe colonies have every motive for preferring the British rule to any\r\nother; yet the contingencies of war may expose them to extraordinary\r\nsufferings. Foreign nations would scarcely attempt a permanent\r\noccupation; but the cities which contain half the inhabitants, and more\r\nthan half the moveable wealth, might be successfully assailed, pillaged,\r\nand easily destroyed. Thus, a powerful European state may expose her\r\ndistant colonies to the calamities once endured by those of Spain. Such\r\nmay be the expectation of the Australias. When they are required to\r\nsupport armies for their defence it will be felt that these are\r\nnecessary chiefly because they are united with an empire whose interests\r\nare complicated with every government in the world.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen the authority of the British crown no measure would be\r\nmore effectual than a federal union of these colonies. They require a\r\nsenate exalted by station above the influences of mere localism, and\r\ncapable of holding in check individual ambition. Statesmen, gathered\r\nfrom the various colonies, would restrain and moderate each other. The\r\nhighest questions of colonial government being confided to their care,\r\nthey would leave the internal improvement of the districts to be pursued\r\nby the local legislative assemblies. The state and expense of colonial\r\ngovernments, which now maintain distinct departments in each colony,\r\nassuming all but imperial style, might then be abated. Monetary\r\nestablishments find no difficulty in conducting their affairs under a\r\ngeneral inspectorship assisted by a local direction. The American\r\nstates, by remitting all great questions to the federal government, are\r\nsustained at less cost than the branch establishments of the Bank of\r\nAustralasia. It is true that a federal union would increase the\r\nimportance of the colonies among nations, and contract the power of the\r\nministry to a distant superintendence: it would, however, prevent many\r\nof the evils of political dependence, and secure to Great Britain all\r\nthe advantages of imperial authority so long as it shall last.\r\n\r\nIt is infinitely important that intelligent and upright men should\r\noccupy their true position in public affairs. A reluctance to face the\r\nvirulent and brutal opposition of low adventurers must be naturally felt\r\nby every refined and educated man. The future character of these\r\ncolonies will, however, depend on the courage and perseverance of the\r\nrespectable classes. The widest extension of suffrage cannot be long\r\nresisted, and qualifications for office founded on property will\r\ninevitably break down. But the reputable and intelligent will be able to\r\ncommand the public mind if they think it worth while to instruct and\r\nconciliate it. Religious men must no longer avoid the strife of the\r\nhustings as inconsistent with piety, or set the claims of religion in\r\nopposition to the obligation of the citizen. Both are in reality one;\r\nand while churches in their corporate capacity stand best when they are\r\nmost distant from the arena of politics, it is the duty of all who\r\nreverence the Almighty's will and regard the welfare of mankind, to\r\ndevote themselves to the social and political amelioration of society.\r\nPersonal character and social position are distinct elements of\r\npolitical power. The Queen of England and her illustrious husband are\r\ninstead of armies: wherever they have moved they shed light and\r\npleasure, not only through the mansions of the rich but the cottages of\r\nthe poor. The theoretical republican is compelled to doubt whether an\r\nexample so valuable may not be worth all the cost and prerogatives of\r\nroyalty.\r\n\r\nThe settlers of Australia are as diversified in their habits as in their\r\norigin. Many in Van Diemen's Land are retired officers of the army and\r\nnavy, masters of merchantmen, and persons of respectable connexions. The\r\nsquatters of Port Phillip are a superior class, although their habits\r\nwill require time to recover from the deteriorating action of bush life.\r\nThe middle classes constitute the most influential body in South\r\nAustralia. The German race are largely interspersed in the colonies of\r\nSouth Australia and Port Phillip. As they acquire the language they\r\nseparate. Their condition improves more rapidly by diffusion, and their\r\nvillages are rather asylums than homes. As might be expected the\r\nprevailing spirit of the colonies is democratic: the democracy of the\r\nmiddle classes, not of the mob. There are no permanent springs of crime:\r\nthe instinct of order, everywhere powerful, cannot but be strong where\r\nsociety is prosperous.\r\n\r\nThe social prospects of the colonists, though not without omens of ill,\r\nwill not discourage the political philosopher. The various races are not\r\nsufficiently distinct to prevent an easy amalgamation. Nationality,\r\nwhether of Germans, Irish, Scotch, or English, insensibly loses its\r\npolitical character. Hostile traditions cannot be naturalised in a new\r\nland: all respectable men condemn the revival of ancient feuds, and they\r\nwill soon disappear for ever.\r\n\r\nMore fortunate in this respect than America, in these regions no African\r\nslavery exists--the brother will not sell his sister, or the father his\r\nson. The temporary inconvenience of transportation will leave no deep\r\nindent on colonial society; but the black brand of slavery is indelible.\r\n\r\nThe liberality and generosity of the Australians has been remarked by\r\nevery stranger. In prosperous times money is at command for every\r\nproject which professes to do good, and suffering is instantly relieved\r\nby bounty which is sometimes extravagant. The loss of a vessel a few\r\nyears ago afforded an instance of this. The utmost latitude of\r\nbeneficence could not exhaust the immense sum (L1,200) contributed to\r\nmake good the personal losses of a few passengers and seamen. The\r\nliberality of the hand is here unrestrained by religious antipathies.\r\nBigotry assumes the character of ill temper and puffing. Two parrots in\r\nPhiladelphia trained to polemics were set over against each other, one\r\ncrying all day, \"there can be no church without a prelate;\" the other,\r\n\"there can be a church without a prelate;\" the passengers were divided\r\nin opinion, but laughing walked on. Such is colonial life.\r\n\r\nNo believer in the glorious destinies of the Anglo-Saxon race can look\r\nupon the events of the last three years without wonder and hope. The\r\nAmerican and British empires are seated on all waters; the old and new\r\nworlds are filled with the name and fame of England and her children.\r\nThe lands conquered by Caesar, those discovered by Columbus, and those\r\nexplored by Cook, are now joined together in one destiny. There are\r\nindeed peculiarities in the various branches of the Anglo-Saxon race;\r\nbut they are only the varieties of the same family, conscious of eternal\r\nunities. How awfully grand are their prospects. America attracted by\r\ngold has pushed forward her commercial pioneers, not only to the\r\nextremity of her territories, but to all the islands of the Pacific. The\r\ndiscovery of gold in California was scarcely less momentous to the\r\nAustralasian than to the American continent. They are now our nearest\r\nneighbours: their markets are affected by our own; their territory\r\noffers the quickest transit to Europe; every hour will develop the\r\nimmense importance of this contiguity--that passage across the isthmus\r\nof Panama, once represented as the last achievement reserved for\r\ncommerce and science in their highest maturity, has already been\r\nassured. The common interest of trading nations will strengthen the\r\nsecurities of peace, diffuse civilisation among the thousand islands of\r\nthe Pacific, and facilitate the extension of Christian knowledge in the\r\nremotest portions of the earth. England, the parent--no longer the\r\nexclusive centre of Anglo-Saxon civilisation--will find auxiliaries only\r\nless powerful than herself in a work once entirely her own.\r\n\r\nAn impetus has been given to the Australian colonies by the discovery of\r\nstill richer gold fields than those of California. In six months, more\r\nthan two millions in value has been taken from the surface of the earth\r\nby laborers unskilled in the process, and who have perhaps wasted more\r\nthan they have secured. The riches which remain scattered over many\r\nhundred miles can only be appropriated by the state as they flow through\r\nthe coffers of commerce. A period cannot be imagined when the precious\r\nmetal will be exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe interest excited in Europe by the discovery of new mineral wealth,\r\nis chiefly important from its tendency to change the current of\r\nemigration to these regions--certainly unsurpassed and scarcely equalled\r\nin the world. Here, under a tropical sun, no fever rages; here\r\nindigenous diseases are unknown; even those so fatal in Europe rarely\r\nvisit this hemisphere. The small pox, the measles, and various other\r\ndisorders fatal to infancy are only occasionally seen, and are scarcely\r\never mortal. No miasma arises from the marshes: no decaying vegetation\r\npoisons the virgin soil. The clement skies and light atmosphere\r\nstimulate and confirm the health. Whether long life is the gift of this\r\nquarter of the globe is hardly yet determined. Those of middle age who\r\nland here find their constitutions recruited; but the country-born come\r\nmore quickly to maturity. It is probable, however, that the highest\r\naverage of human life will be attained: fewer will die in infancy,\r\nperhaps a smaller proportionate number reach old age.\r\n\r\nIf the productions of these countries are considered, they will be still\r\nmore attractive than other unoccupied regions. Nature has multiplied her\r\ngifts with a liberal hand. It were more easy to enumerate those that are\r\nwanting than those that exist. Gold, silver, iron, copper, coal, and\r\nevery variety of stone are included in our geological wealth. All the\r\nfruits of the tropics and of the most temperate lands may be easily\r\nbrought to the same table. Taking Tasmania and Port Phillip as the\r\ncentral regions; on the right and on the left the fertile earth yields\r\nevery variety of European fruits, until the meridian is reached where\r\nthe sugar cane and cotton tree flourish. It is true, that some other\r\nlands present more comparative fertility, but the Australias contain\r\nsufficient alluvial soils to satisfy the wants of millions. Washington\r\nraised but twenty bushels of wheat per acre in his paternal lands of\r\nVirginia. The intelligent Australian farmer often far exceeds that\r\nquantity even with imperfect cultivation. Nor is there a season of the\r\nyear when he cannot toil, or one when the garden is wholly unproductive.\r\n\r\nBut if the position of Australia in relation to the rest of the world be\r\nsurveyed, the prospect is still more brilliant. An Englishman measures\r\ndistance from his native land, and thus his pardonable vanity fixes the\r\nAustralias at the extremity of the earth. But such is not the real\r\nposition of New Holland. In reference to the most populous and fertile,\r\nor the most ancient and opulent,[283] it has been compared to the frog\r\nor soft part of a horse's foot in relation to the outline of the hoof.\r\nWith the face turning to the north, America is on the right, Asia and\r\nAfrica on the left. Great Britain, the parent land, is far more distant\r\nfrom most of those mighty regions which feed her commerce and sustain\r\nher strength than her Australian colonies. They will soon meet her\r\nvessels on every shore. Steam navigation will flourish on the Pacific\r\nocean not less than on the rivers of America. The eye that scans the\r\nfuture, guided by calculation rather than fancy, sees the ports of\r\nAustralia thronged with steamers, or follows them traversing every sea\r\nand ocean, and bringing from every city of the civilised world both\r\nmerchandise and men.\r\n\r\nThus the progress of the next quarter of a century will be multiplied by\r\nits years.\r\n\r\nWhen North America separated from Great Britain, she exported not much\r\nmore than four millions in value per annum. Australia already exports\r\nnot less.[284] The commerce of England with her Australian colonies is\r\nwithout parallel. History affords no example of such rapid advancement;\r\nand this not as the result of protective laws, or of remarkable\r\nintelligence or enterprise, but as the fruit of that boundless opulence\r\nscattered by the hand of nature and gathered with unexampled facility.\r\nThe merchant laments the paucity of navigable streams. Yet there are\r\nrivers of many hundred miles extent, which will ultimately be available\r\nto commerce. The engineer of Europe would laugh at difficulties opposed\r\nby stones, and trees, and marshes. Population will one day justify the\r\nimprovement by art of what nature has only partially accomplished. But\r\nin the level plains of the Australias there is a compensation for this\r\ndeficiency. Hundreds of miles are almost prepared for the rail road; and\r\nas the cheap methods adopted in America become known, the inland\r\ncommunication will be rapidly enlarged.\r\n\r\nThe late date of the discovery of gold in Australasia has created much\r\nastonishment. It seems to have been concealed by Providence, or rather\r\nthe signs of its existence were not permitted to arrest attention, until\r\nthe colonies could endure the shock. A shepherd publicly sold at Sydney\r\nseveral ounces of gold in 1844. Years after a still larger quantity was\r\nexposed in Victoria (1849). These facts were recorded in the journals of\r\nthe time; in the first instance scarcely awakening the slightest\r\ninterest, and the last producing little but distrust and derision. The\r\ndelay has probably upon the whole benefited both the colonies and the\r\nhuman race. Had gold been discovered before the era of free immigration\r\nit must have led to frightful disorders. California has added another\r\nto those warnings presented in the history of gold mining, that the\r\nabsorbing pursuit, for a time, suspends the voice of reason and\r\nmorality. The multitudes who have precipitated themselves on the gold\r\nfields of Victoria indicate the uniform direction of similar passions;\r\nyet how superior are our present resources to those of former times or\r\nof other countries. The governments organised and intelligent, and\r\nsustained by the strong moral support of four hundred Christian\r\ncongregations. The social interests of perhaps not less than fifty\r\nthousand families will be able to check, and probably to master, the\r\nspirit of anarchy and violence. That any lives should be sacrificed is\r\nof course a matter of regret; but the politician and the philanthropist\r\nmay pronounce in favor of a dispensation which though permitting the\r\nsacrifice of a few, will rapidly cover the regions around us with\r\nvillages, towns, and homesteads.\r\n\r\nThough rich beyond example, the mines will be abandoned by the many for\r\nwhom the pleasures and the rest of home, the calm and even pursuits of\r\nindustry, and the intercourse of civil and religious life have permanent\r\nattractions. Yet the unexampled profusion of the precious metal must\r\nrapidly augment our commerce and supply the means of mercantile\r\nenterprise. The capital we have so often coveted is now within our\r\nreach. The farmer desired a market; he has it in his neighbourhood, at\r\nhis very door. The demand for foreign articles will give employment to\r\nshipping directly trading from the Australian to the producing market.\r\nThe increase of commerce will thus lead to its independence. The\r\nAustralian merchant will acquire the same relation to the general trade\r\nof the world as the American possesses. The ships of America carry her\r\npassengers and convey her produce. She divides the profits equally with\r\nher customer.[285]\r\n\r\nThe happiness and prosperity of the people is by Divine Providence\r\nplaced within their power. If they grasp at wealth to the neglect of\r\ntheir social and political duties; if, for the sake of selfish ease,\r\nthey resign to ignorant and violent men the business of legislation; if\r\nthey tolerate systematic debauchery, gambling and sharping; if they\r\ncountenance the press when sporting with religion, or rendering private\r\nreputation worthless; if they neglect the education of the rising\r\ngeneration, and the instruction of the working classes; if the rich\r\nattempt to secure the privileges of rank by restricting the franchises\r\nof the less powerful; if worldly pleasure invade the seasons of\r\ndevotion; and the worship of God be neglected by the masses of the\r\npeople,--then will they become unfit for liberty; base and sensual, they\r\nwill be loathed and despised; the moral Governor of the world will\r\nassert his sovereignty, and will visit a worthless and ungrateful race\r\nwith the yoke of bondage, the scourge of anarchy, or the besom of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281: A more venal and almost more desirable fault can scarcely\r\nbe ascribed to a governor than a strong attachment to the people whom he\r\nis sent to govern.--_Coleridge's friend_, vol. 3, p. 325.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 282: It is very difficult to make the mass of mankind believe\r\nthat the state of things is ever to be otherwise than they have been\r\naccustomed to see it. I have very often heard old persons describe the\r\nimpossibility of making any one believe that the American colonies could\r\never be separated from this country. It was always considered as an idle\r\ndream of discontented politicians, good enough to fill up the periods of\r\na speech, but which no practical man, devoid of the spirit of party,\r\nconsidered to be within the limits of possibility. There was a period\r\nwhen the slightest concession would have satisfied the Americans; but\r\nall the world was in heroics; one set of gentlemen met at the Lamb, and\r\nanother at the Lion: blood and treasure men, breathing war, vengeance,\r\nand contempt; and in eight years afterwards, an awkward looking\r\ngentleman in plain clothes walked up to the drawing-room of St. James's,\r\nin the midst of the gentlemen of the Lion and Lamb, and was introduced\r\nas the _ambassador from the United States of America_.--_Works of Sidney\r\nSmith, Vol. III., p. 336._\r\n\r\n\"If you are told of the existence of discontent in any of your colonial\r\npossessions, do not believe it; and if any application be made to you\r\nfor the redress of the grievances of any of your colonial possessions,\r\nreject the prayer at once; for if you grant that, you may be asked for\r\nsomething more. Redress no grievance, lest it should lead to a petition\r\nfor the removal of another cause of complaint. Believe only the accounts\r\nwhich reach you from governors, and others officially connected with\r\nyour colonies; and treat any statements in opposition to their accounts\r\nas the invention of demagogues, whom you should hang if you could catch\r\nthem, and thus tranquillize the colony.\"--_Franklin._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 283: \"Just before I embarked at Plymouth, I visited my\r\ngrandmother, in order to take leave of her for ever. Poor old soul! she\r\nwas already dead to the concerns of this life: my departure could make\r\nbut little difference in the time of our separation; and it was of no\r\nimportance to her which of us should quit the other. My resolution,\r\nhowever, revived for a day all her woman's feelings: she shed abundance\r\nof tears, and then became extremely curious to know every particular\r\nabout the place to which I was going. I rubbed her spectacles whilst she\r\nwiped her eyes, and, having placed before her a common English chart of\r\nthe world, pointed out the situation of New Holland. She shook her head.\r\n'What displeases, you, my dear Madam P' said I. 'Why,' she answered, 'it\r\nis terribly out of the way; down in the very right-hand corner of the\r\nworld.' The chart being mine, I cut it in two through the meridian of\r\nIceland, transposed the parts laterally, and turned them upside down.\r\n'Now,' asked I, 'where is England P' 'Ah, boy,' she replied, 'you may do\r\nwhat you like with the map; but you can't twist the world about in that\r\nmanner, though they _are_ making sad changes in it.'\"--_A Letter from\r\nSydney; the principal town of Australia.

The first hour of the present\r\nyear was ushered in by a brilliant sun which rose above the horizon in\r\nall its majesty, shedding its gladsome rays over a happy and a\r\nprosperous people--every heart was gay--every industrious hand was\r\nemployed, and our future prospects were as cheering as the most ardent\r\nmind could have desired. Our great staple was rapidly increasing, and\r\nhad even then become an export which commanded the attention of the\r\nBritish nation. Our tallow was of considerable value--our copper mines\r\nwere presenting indications of richness--our pastoral and agricultural\r\ninterests were flourishing, and it was evident to all, that we must at\r\nno very distant period become a great and prosperous colony. In fact it\r\ncould have been almost impossible to suggest a discovery that could add\r\nto our importance; but before this memorable year had half sped its\r\ncourse, a colonist returned from San Francisco, impressed with the\r\nsimilarity that existed between the geological formation of this land\r\nand that in which he had been sojourning, and determined to bring it to\r\nlight if possible. No sooner was he on shore than he set boldly out on\r\nhis great expedition, notwithstanding the ridicule of his friends, who\r\npromised him disappointment for his reward. What wonderful events have\r\nfrequently sprung from simple causes! Our mountains and glens had been\r\nvisited by scientific men of several nations, but they had failed to\r\ntrace anything beyond mere indications. Such, however, was not the case\r\nwith Edward Hammond Hargraves, who, after spending a few weeks in the\r\nbush, announced to his brother colonists that their hills and valleys\r\ncontained in rich abundance the precious metal by which the commerce of\r\nthe world is carried on. All honor be to the man whose keen observation\r\nhas brought into practical operation so vast a gold field for the\r\nemployment of British labour and British capital. May he enjoy not only\r\nthe reward which conscience yields to those who perform a good action,\r\nbut may his merits be duly appreciated by an Australian public, and that\r\nappreciation assume a form that shall descend from father to son, as\r\nlong as the name of Hargraves exists! Such an addition to our already\r\ndeveloped colonial resources cannot fail to add materially to our\r\nposition, and raise us, in an incredibly short space of time, from a\r\nsmall colony into a noble and powerful nation. Our vast interior will be\r\nspeedily populated; Britain will be relieved of her starving thousands;\r\nand Australia will stand prominently forward as the brightest jewel in\r\nHer Majesty's Crown.--_Lloyd's Gold Circular._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF TASMANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALPHABETICAL ACCOUNT OF CHIEF PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF CHIEF PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island of Tasmania is situated between the 40th and 44th parallels\r\nof south latitude, and between the 144th and 149th degrees of east\r\nlongitude. Its greatest length is 190 miles, and its breadth, 170. It\r\ncontains 24,000 square miles, or 15,000,000 acres, having a surface\r\nnearly equal to that of Ireland. Its general character is mountainous,\r\nwith numerous beautiful valleys, rendered fertile by numberless streams\r\ndescending from the hills, and watering, in their course to the sea,\r\nlarge tracts of country. The south-western coast, washed by the Southern\r\nOcean, is high and cold, but the climate of the northern and inland\r\ndistricts is one of the finest in the temperate zone, and produces in\r\nabundance and variety all the fruits which are found under the same\r\nlatitude in Europe. The harbor of Hobart is one of the finest in the\r\nworld. The principal rivers are the Derwent, Ouse, Clyde, Jordan, Coal,\r\nHuon, and Dee, in the south; and the Tamar, North and South Esk,\r\nMacquarie, Lake, Mersey, Leven, Arthur, Blyth, Forth, and Meander, in\r\nthe north. The chief bays are Adventure Bay, in Bruni Island, so named\r\nafter Captain Furneaux's discovery ship, and where Cook anchored in his\r\nthird voyage; Fortescue, Port Arthur, Fredrick Hendrick's (so named by\r\nTasman), Prosser's, Spring, Oyster, and George's Bays, and the Bay of\r\nFires, on the eastern coast; Storm Bay (so named from the weather which\r\nTasman experienced there), Bad Bay (in Bruni Island), Recherche (named\r\nafter the ship in which D'Entrecasteaux sailed in search of La Perouse),\r\nEsperance (after the ship which accompanied the admiral), and Port\r\nDavey, on the southern coast; Macquarie Harbor, on the western; Port\r\nSorell, Port Frederic, Emu Bay, and East and West Bay, at Circular Head,\r\non the northern coast. The principal capes are Cape Grim, the\r\nnorth-western and most northern extremity of the island, in lat. 40 deg. 47'\r\nS., and long. 144 deg. 50' E.; Cape Portland, the north-eastern point; St.\r\nHelen's Head, the most easterly point, in long. 148 deg. 25' E.; South Cape,\r\nin lat. 43 deg. 35' S.; and West Cape, in long. 144 deg. 40' E.; St. Patrick's\r\nHead, Cape Pillar, and Cape Lodi, on the eastern coast; Tasman's Head,\r\nCape Raoul, and South-west Cape, on the south; Rocky Point, Point Hibbs,\r\nand Cape Sorell, on the west; and Rocky Cape, Circular Head, Table Cape,\r\nand Stony Head, on the north. The settled part of the island is divided\r\ninto eleven counties,--three northern, Devon, Dorset, and Cornwall; four\r\nmidland--Westmoreland, Somerset, Glamorgan, and Cumberland; and four\r\nsouthern--Kent, Buckingham, Pembroke, and Monmouth; each having an area\r\nof 1,600 square miles. These counties are subdivided into hundreds and\r\nparishes, the former containing 100 and the latter 25 square miles. To\r\nmost of these divisions, as well as to the fifteen electoral districts,\r\nBritish names have been given. The island is also divided into nineteen\r\npolice districts, each having a resident police magistrate, chief\r\nconstable, police clerk, and deputy registrar of births, deaths, and\r\nmarriages. In the country districts, the police magistrates act as\r\ncoroners, and in the districts of New Norfolk, Richmond, Oatlands,\r\nCampbell Town, Longford, Horton, and South Port, as commissioners of the\r\ncourt of requests. In the first five of these districts they are also\r\ndeputy chairmen of courts of quarter sessions. The chief and best\r\nconstructed road in the island is that which connects the towns of\r\nHobart and Launceston. It is 121 miles in length, and 30 years were\r\nspent in its construction. The population, according to the census taken\r\non 1st March, 1851, is 70,130; of this number 30,488 are free, 21,590\r\nwere born in the colony, and the remainder are prisoners of the crown.\r\nThe number of places of worship in the colony is 108, containing about\r\n23,000 sittings; the number of ordained ministers is 100; there are also\r\nmissionaries, lay preachers, and other persons, who supply the remote\r\nstations. Of Sunday schools belonging to all denominations there are\r\nabout 60; of public and denominational schools, 74; of private schools,\r\nabout 100; besides these, there are a high school, and an episcopal\r\ncollege and two grammar schools. The total number of schools is above\r\n300. Of the public schools, 10 are wholly, and the remainder partly\r\nsupported by voluntary contributions. There are 109 public institutions\r\nof various kinds, inclusive of 2 local and 2 English banks, 2 banks for\r\nsavings, 4 joint-stock companies, and 3 English and 4 local insurance\r\noffices. Of these societies 10 are literary and scientific (including 2\r\nmechanics' institutes, with large libraries, and a school of arts), 17\r\nare agricultural and horticultural, 14 charitable, 9 missionary and\r\nreligious instruction, 6 benefit, 10 temperance, 7 masonic and odd\r\nfellows, and 10 miscellaneous, including a mercantile assistants'\r\nassociation, a turf club, and united service club. Excepting 12, which\r\nare partly supported by government, the whole of these institutions are\r\nmaintained by voluntary subscriptions. The number of houses is 11,844,\r\nof which 5,723 are of stone or brick, and the remainder of wood. The\r\nnumber of acres under cultivation is 177,600; the number of horses,\r\n17,200; of cattle, 85,490; of sheep, 1,752,900. The number of vessels\r\nbelonging to the colony is 240, besides vessels under 40 tons, and their\r\ncollective tonnage 18,500 tons. There are four northern and two southern\r\nlight-houses, and about twenty vessels are employed in the whale\r\nfishery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Abercrombie_--a township in the parish of Abercrombie and county of\r\nSomerset.\r\n\r\n_Adamson's Peak_--a mountain in the south-eastern corner of the island,\r\nsaid to be 4,000 feet high.\r\n\r\n_Alarm_--a river which falls into Bass' Strait on the western side of\r\nRocky Cape.\r\n\r\n_Altamont_--a village on the Derwent, 20 miles from Hobart.\r\n\r\n_Andover_--a village on Little Swan Port River, in the parish of\r\nBrisbane and county of Somerset, about 50 miles from Hobart.\r\n\r\n_Antill Ponds_--so called by Governor Macquarie, in honor of Major\r\nAntill of the 48th regiment--a district in the county of Somerset, 60\r\nmiles from Hobart, the road to which passes through it.

It is on the main road, 20 miles from Hobart. The country near\r\nBagdad is fertile, and the road passes by numerous farms. On the\r\nnorthern side is a beautiful valley, the cultivated part of which is two\r\nmiles wide, bounded by lofty hills thickly wooded, and through which\r\nflows the Bagdad Creek.\r\n\r\n_Barrow_--a lofty hill, about 13 miles east of Launceston.\r\n\r\n_Bayford_--a village in the parish of Spring Hill and county of\r\nMonmouth, about 40 miles from Hobart.\r\n\r\n_Bellerive_--a township nearly opposite Hobart, in the parish of\r\nClarence and county of Monmouth.\r\n\r\n_Ben Lomond_--a mountain in Cornwall, 5,000 feet high, about 45 miles\r\nfrom Launceston, and 15 from Fingal. A rivulet of the same name rises\r\nhere, and falls into the South Esk, about 30 miles from Launceston.\r\nAbout 15 miles north of this mountain is Ben Nevis, 3,900 feet high.\r\nDuring winter these elevated points, which are named after celebrated\r\nmountains of Scotland, are covered with snow, and seen from a distance,\r\nthey present a magnificent appearance. They form parts of a chain of\r\nmountains extending inland from St. Patrick's Head to the northern\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n_Beverley_--a township on the Ben Lomond Rivulet, in the parish of\r\nBeverley and county of Cornwall, about 30 miles from Launceston.\r\n\r\n_Bishopsbourne_--a village in Westmoreland, about 8 miles from Longford\r\nand 26 from Launceston.

The\r\nDerwent, which is about three-quarters of a mile in width at this place,\r\nis crossed by a bridge of wood, which forms a part of the main road from\r\nHobart to Launceston, and is said to be the largest work of the kind in\r\nthe Australian colonies. The river is spanned to a length of 2,300 feet\r\nby an earthen causeway, and the length of the bridge from the end of\r\nthis to the northern shore is 1,010 feet, with a breadth of roadway of\r\n24 feet; the whole length of the work being 3,310 feet, or nearly\r\nthree-quarters of a mile. The navigation of the river is preserved by\r\nmeans of a moveable platform near the northern shore. The timber was\r\nprocured from Mount Dromedary, 7 miles from the bridge, which was begun\r\nin January, '48, and opened in April, '49. The cost was L7,580.\r\n\r\n_Brighton_--a town in the parish of Drummond and county of Monmouth.

This district is celebrated for\r\nthe fineness of its potatoes.\r\n\r\n_Brumby's Creek_--a small stream rising among the Westmoreland\r\nmountains, and joining the Lake River, about 12 miles south of Longford.\r\nSeveral streams rising near the Western Lagoon fall into it.\r\n\r\n_Bruni_--an island lying between D'Entrecasteaux Channel and Storm Bay,\r\nat the entrance of the Derwent. It was named after the French admiral\r\nwho discovered it. It is about 50 miles long, and varies in breadth from\r\n4 to 15 miles. It consists of two parts, connected by a long and narrow\r\nneck of land. There are a township called Lonnon and several farms in\r\nthe northern part of the island, and in most of the bays many fine kinds\r\nof fish are found in abundance.

The river is crossed by a bridge or\r\ncauseway, 200 yards long, and on the southern side are numerous fine\r\nfarms. The road to Avoca, Fingal, and the eastern coast here branches\r\noff from the main line. In the town there are also a gaol and police and\r\npost offices. There is a resident police magistrate. The population of\r\nthe town and police district is 2,319, and the number of houses, 255 of\r\nwhich are of stone or brick, is 386. Campbell Town is also an electoral\r\ndistrict. It is considered to be the middle district of the colony, and\r\nthe Midland Agricultural Association originated here. R. Q. Kermode,\r\nEsq., is the first member for Campbell Town.\r\n\r\n_Carlton_--a village and post station on the stream of that name, in the\r\nparish of Carlton, and county of Pembroke, about 35 miles from Hobart.\r\nThe Carlton falls into North Bay, below Pittwater.\r\n\r\n_Carrick_--a township and post-station on the west bank of the Liffey\r\nand western road, in the parish of Carrick and county of Westmoreland,\r\n113 miles from Hobart and 10 from Launceston.

It is seen at sea at the distance of 10 leagues. It\r\nis 280 miles from Hobart, and 160 from Launceston, and here the western\r\nroad terminates. The town of Stanley, which stands on the eastern side,\r\ncontains an episcopal church, a Roman catholic chapel, a post station, a\r\ncustom-house, three inns, and some substantial buildings. It has also a\r\nbenevolent society, and schools. There is a resident police magistrate.\r\nThe Van Diemen's Land Company has an extensive establishment here, and a\r\nconsiderable trade is carried on between the settlers in the\r\nneighborhood and Victoria, to which large quantities of timber,\r\npotatoes, and other produce grown on the fertile farms on the coast, are\r\nshipped in small vessels belonging to the port. The town and district of\r\nStanley have greatly advanced during the last ten years, under the\r\nintelligent management of Mr. Gibson, the company's agent. The failure\r\nof the previous management may be traced to those general causes which\r\nhave always prevented the success of similar companies, when they have\r\nattempted cultivation and grazing. Mr. Gibson urged upon the company the\r\nimportance of establishing a tenantry, and succeeded in attracting a\r\nconsiderable rural population by offering advantageous terms to small\r\nfarmers. The arrangements made with them, from the depression of prices,\r\nproved unfavorable to the company, but the prosperity of their tenants\r\nhas probably firmly fixed a population on their estates, which will\r\nultimately indemnify them for all their losses. Occupying a geographical\r\nposition highly favorable to trade, and in the vicinity of extensive\r\nforests of valuable timber, there can be no doubt that within a few\r\nyears their settlements will become of great importance. Within a few\r\nhours' sail of Port Phillip and South Australia, their timber will find\r\nan increasing market, and enable their settlers to turn to good account\r\nwhat often elsewhere proves an incumbrance. The population of the\r\ndistrict, which is called Horton, is about 900, and the number of houses\r\n137.\r\n\r\n_Clarence Plains_--a cultivated and fertile district on the east bank of\r\nthe Derwent, nearly opposite Hobart.

It contains a small episcopal church and a Wesleyan\r\nchapel, and three inns. There is a police station with a district\r\nconstable, and the assistant police magistrate of Westbury holds a court\r\ntwice in a week. About 15 miles from Deloraine, in the Western\r\nMountains, are situated the great caves, which, in extent and beauty,\r\nperhaps equal subterranean wonders of more celebrity. They have not\r\noften been visited; but those who have seen them describe them as being\r\nextremely grand and beautiful. The entrance of the principal cave, which\r\nis considerably more than two miles in length, is in the limestone rock,\r\nat the upper extremity of a narrow ravine, down which flows the stream\r\nwhich issues from the mouth of the cave, and extends throughout its\r\nwhole length. The opening is thirty feet high, and fifty or sixty in\r\nwidth. At a considerable distance from the entrance light is admitted by\r\ntwo openings in the roof, the only ones throughout the whole extent of\r\nthe cave, and when these are passed the full beauty of the scene breaks\r\nupon the view of the visitor. Stalactites of every form, hang like\r\nicicles from the roof; some presenting the appearance of inverted cones,\r\nothers that of glistening semi-transparent tubes, about the thickness of\r\na pipe stem, and several yards in length. In some parts, the\r\nstalactites, meeting with their opposite stalagmites, form pillars in\r\nappearance supporting a roof of immense height. In other places they\r\nassume the form of elegant and flowing drapery thrown over the huge\r\nrocks that project from the sides of the cavern. The fringes of this\r\ndrapery, when struck by any hard substance, give forth a ringing sound,\r\nand every variety of note, high or low, according to their respective\r\nlengths. The floor is covered with stalagmites of every form, and it\r\nsparkles as if paved with diamonds. If the visitor extinguish his torch,\r\nmyriads of glow-worms are seen to cover the roof and walls, emitting a\r\nfaint blue light, and making the surrounding stalactites appear like\r\nspectres in the gloom. As the spectator proceeds, new objects of wonder\r\nappear. In some places the stalactites, shooting out in all directions,\r\ninto innumerable small fibres, appear like fret-work along the roof; in\r\nothers like masses of elegant drapery, extending fold above fold, to the\r\nheight of thirty or forty feet, from the floor to the roof. Near the\r\nentrance of the cave they are of a grey or brownish color, but in the\r\ninterior they are of a pure white. There are several chambers, some of\r\ngreat beauty, which branch off from the main passage, and have been\r\nformed by the rivulet which passes through the cave. Others will\r\nprobably yet be discovered in the Western Mountains.\r\n\r\n_Denbigh_--a township in the parish of that name, and county of\r\nSomerset, on the Lake River, about 80 miles from Hobart.\r\n\r\n_D'Entrecasteaux_--the name of the channel between the main land and\r\nBruni Island, so called after the French admiral who first sailed\r\nthrough it.

Conditional servitude, under indentures or\r\n     covenants, had from the first existed in Virginia. The servant\r\n     stood to his master in the relation of a debtor bound to repay the\r\n     cost of his emigration by employing his powers for the benefit of\r\n     his creditors--oppression easily ensued. Men who had been\r\n     transported to Virginia at the expense of L10, were sometimes sold\r\n     for L40 or L50, or even for L60. The supply of white servants\r\n     became a regular business, and a class of men, nick-named\r\n     \"spirits,\" used to delude young persons and idlers into embarking\r\n     for America as to a land of plenty. White servants came to be a\r\n     usual article of traffic. They were sold in England to be\r\n     transported, and in Virginia, were resold to the highest bidder. In\r\n     1672, the average prices for five years service when due, was about\r\n     L10.--_Bancroft_, vol. i. p. 175.\r\n\r\n     \"The Scots, whom God delivered into your bands at Durbar, whereof\r\n     sundry were sent here, we have been desirous as we could, to make\r\n     their yoke easy. Such as were sick of the scurvy or other diseases,\r\n     have not wanted physic and surgery. They have not been sold for\r\n     slaves, to perpetual servitude, but for six, or seven, or eight\r\n     years, as we do our own; and he that bought the most of them I\r\n     hear, buildeth for every four of them a house, and layeth some\r\n     acres of ground thereto, which he giveth them as their own,\r\n     requiring them three days of the week to work for him by turns, and\r\n     four days for themselves, and promises as soon as they can repay\r\n     him the money laid out for them, he will set them at\r\n     liberty.\"--_Letter to Cromwell, by Mather Cotton: Carlyle's Letters\r\n     and Speeches_, vol. ii. p. 349.\r\n\r\n     Page 102. \"I beseech your Majesty that I may inform that each\r\n     person will be worth ten pounds, if not fifteen pounds a-piece.\r\n     And, sir, if your majesty orders that as you have already designed,\r\n     persons that have not suffered in the service, will run away with\r\n     the booty.\"--_Letter from Jefferies, Sep., 1685._\r\n\r\n     \"Take all care they continue to serve for ten years at least, and\r\n     that they be not permitted in any manner to redeem themselves by\r\n     money or otherwise until that term be fully expired.

Letters (countersigned by\r\n     Sunderland) to the Governor of Virginia, Oct., 1685--_Bancroft_,\r\n     vol. ii. p. 25.\r\n\r\n     Page 102. \"Good God! where am I? In Bristol! This city it seems,\r\n     claims the privilege of hanging and drawing among themselves. I\r\n     find you have more need of a special commission once a month at\r\n     least. The very magistrates that should be ministers of justice,\r\n     fall out with one another to that degree, that they will scarcely\r\n     dine together, and yet I find they can agree for their interests if\r\n     there be _a kid_ in the case, for I hear that kidnapping is much in\r\n     request in this city.

A commission was appointed to enquire into those\r\n     allegations, and their report fell into the hands of the author\r\n     after the account of the _Amphitrite_ was printed. It does not\r\n     appear, that the imputations of sordid calculation were well\r\n     grounded, and no bond would have been enforced for an unavoidable\r\n     breach of contract.\r\n\r\n     Page 148, for \"_free_ women,\" read \"_freed_ women.\"\r\n\r\n     Page 149, for \"_Macarthur's New South Wales_,\" read \"_Mudie's\r\n     Felonry_.\"\r\n\r\n     Page 151, for \"12,000,\" read \"1,200 houses.\"\r\n\r\n     Page 155, for \"regarded by,\" read \"appeared to.\"\r\n\r\n     Page 166. Rev. S. Marsden. A pamphlet was published by Mr. Marsden,\r\n     called _A Statement Relative to Illegal Punishment_ (1828). A\r\n     warrant to this effect was produced:--\"Sitting magistrates--Henry\r\n     Grattan Douglas, Esq., and Rev. S. Marsden. James Blackburn,\r\n     attached to the prisoners' barracks, ordered to receive twenty-five\r\n     lashes every morning until he tells who were the four men in\r\n     company with him gambling.\" This warrant, Mr. Marsden\r\n     declared a forgery. Other charges were made of the same character,\r\n     but they were refuted by Mr. Marsden. He proved his absence from\r\n     the bench when sentences of torture were passed. In the text there\r\n     is an apparent leaning to the charge, but there appears no fair\r\n     ground to reject Mr. Marsden's refutation, which is most decisive\r\n     as to his own participation in this revolting practice.\r\n\r\n     Page 189, for \"real name,\" read \"known name.\"\r\n\r\n     Page 271, for \"primitive,\" read \"punitive.\"\r\n\r\n     Page 321, for \"Report of Institutions,\" read \"Report of Hanwell\r\n     Institution.\"\r\n\r\n     Page 335. The long delay in the publication of this work has given\r\n     time for several important changes in the aspect of convict\r\n     discipline. The local government of Van Diemen's Land, resolved in\r\n     November, 1850, to restore the practice of assignment, and notices\r\n     for this purpose were issued.\r\n\r\n     Thus the convict was bound to serve his master according to the\r\n     duration of his sentence, and to accept such wages as the convict\r\n     department might sanction. The object of this change was to\r\n     reconcile the settlers to the continuance of transportation, by\r\n     restoring an interest and authority which the probation system\r\n     subverted.\r\n\r\n     The men who had been promised comparative liberty on their arrival,\r\n     complained bitterly of this change, and claimed to work as free\r\n     servants with masters of their own choice. Earl Grey expressed\r\n     strong disapproval of this return to a system expressly repudiated\r\n     by his party, and condemned by himself, and ordered the governor to\r\n     compensate the men for breach of faith. August 4. 1851; No. 156.\r\n\r\n     The discovery of gold has altered the prospects of laborers. The\r\n     amazing productiveness of the gold fields has withdrawn almost all\r\n     good free labor from the colony. The active convict has the means\r\n     of earning large wages, or of reaching the gold fields at an\r\n     expense estimated at L5, including hush money. Thus the _Gazette_,\r\n     from January 6, to March 30, 1852, shows the absconding of 492, and\r\n     the arrest of 254. Yet many are not reported, and are therefore not\r\n     included in these lists.\r\n\r\n     The incessant agitation of the colonies has produced considerable\r\n     activity in the department, and external decency is respected. The\r\n     more prominent establishments--both male and female, are creditably\r\n     kept, and probably the internal evils are abated; and yet what can\r\n     be hoped for men who, on their discharge from detention, recognise\r\n     everywhere the associations and the haunts of convictism?",
