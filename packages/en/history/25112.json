CASTELL HOPKINS, F.S.S.\r\n\r\n1910\r\n\r\n_Author of \"Queen Victoria, Her Life and Reign;\" \"Life and Work of\r\nMr. Gladstone;\" \"The Story of the Dominion\", &c., &c._\r\n\r\nProfusely Illustrated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright 1910, by\r\nW. E. Scull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring a number of years' study of British institutions in their modern\r\ndevelopment and of British public life in its adjustment to new and\r\nchanging conditions I have felt an ever-growing appreciation of the\r\nactive influence exercised by the late Sovereign of the British Empire\r\nupon the social life and public interests of the United Kingdom and an\r\never-increasing admiration for his natural abilities and rare\r\ntactfulness of character. King Edward the Seventh, in a sixty years'\r\ntenure of the difficult position of Heir to the British Throne, built\r\ninto the history of his country and Empire a record of which he and his\r\npeople had every reason to be proud. He had for many years the\r\nresponsibilities of a Royal position without the actual power; the\r\npublic functions of a great ruler without the resources usually\r\navailable; the knowledge, experience and statecraft of a wise Sovereign\r\nwithout Regal environment.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, however, rose above the apparent difficulties of\r\nhis position and for more than a quarter of a century emulated the wise\r\nexample of his princely father--Albert the Good--and profited by the\r\nbeautiful character and unquestioned statesmanship of his august mother.\r\nAs with all those upon whose life beats the glare of ever-present\r\npublicity and upon whose actions the press of friendly and hostile\r\nnations alike have the privilege of ceaseless comment, the Heir to the\r\nBritish Throne had to suffer from atrocious canards as well as from\r\nfulsome compliments. Unlike many others, however, he afterwards lived\r\ndown the falsehoods of an early time; conquered by his clear, open life\r\nthe occasional hostility of a later day; and at the period of his\r\naccession to the Throne was, without and beyond question, the best liked\r\nPrince in Europe--the most universally popular man in the United\r\nKingdom and its external Empire. Upon the verge of His Majesty's\r\nCoronation there occurred that sudden and dramatic illness which proved\r\nso well the bravery and patience of the man, and increased so greatly\r\nthe popularity and _prestige_ of the Monarch.\r\n\r\nSince then the late King has yearly grown in the regard of his people\r\nabroad, in the respect of other rulers and nations, in the admiration of\r\nall who understood the difficulties of his position, the real force of\r\nhis personality and influence, the power with which he drew to the\r\nThrone--even after the remarkable reign of Victoria the Good--an\r\nincreased affection and loyalty from Australians and South Africans and\r\nCanadians alike, an added confidence and loyal faith in his judgment\r\nfrom all his British peoples whether at home or over seas.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, which King Edward always regarded with an\r\nadmiration which the enterprise and energy of its people so well\r\ndeserved, he in turn received a degree of respect and regard which did\r\nnot at one time seem probable. To him, ever since the visit to the\r\nRepublic in 1860, a closer and better relation between the two great\r\ncountries had been an ideal toward which as statesman and Prince and\r\nSovereign he guided the English-speaking race.\r\n\r\nThe reader of these pages will, I hope, receive a permanent impression\r\nof the career and character of one who has been at once a popular\r\nPrince, a great King, a worthy head of the British Empire and of his own\r\nfamily, a statesman who has won and worn the proud title of \"The Royal\r\nPeacemaker.\"\r\n\r\nJ.

P. Firth R.A.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nThe Crown and the Empire\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great development of a political nature in the British Empire of the\r\nnineteenth century was the complete harmony which gradually evolved\r\nbetween the Monarchy and a world-wide democracy. This process was\r\nall-important because it eliminated an element of internal discord which\r\nhas destroyed more than one nation in the past; because it permitted the\r\npeaceful progress of scattered states to continue through the passing\r\nyears without having questions of allegiance to seriously hamper their\r\ngrowth; because it trained political thought along lines of stability\r\nand continuity and made loyalty and liberty consistent and almost\r\nsynonymous terms; because it made the Crown the central symbol of the\r\nEmpire's unity, the visible object of a world-wide allegiance, the\r\nspecial token of a common aspiration and a common sentiment amongst many\r\nmillions of English-speaking people--the subject of untutored reverence\r\nand unquestioned respect amongst hundreds of millions of other races.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POSITION OF THE CROWN\r\n\r\nThe chief factor in this development was the late Queen Victoria, and to\r\nthe inheritance of the fabric thus evolved came a son who was educated\r\namid the constitutional environment in which she lived and was trained\r\nin the Imperial ideas which she so strongly held and so wisely impressed\r\nupon her statesmen, her family and her people. King Edward came into\r\nresponsibilities which were greater and more imposing than those ever\r\nbefore inherited by a reigning sovereign. He had not only the great\r\nexample and life of his predecessor as a model and as a comparison; not\r\nonly the same vast and ever-changing and expanding Empire to rule over;\r\nnot only a similar myriad-eyed press and public to watch his every\r\nexpression and movement; but he entered with his people upon a new\r\ncentury in which one of the first and most prominent features is a decay\r\nin popular respect for Parliament and a revival of the old-time love for\r\nstately display, for ceremonial and for the appropriate trappings of\r\nroyalty. With this evident and growing influence of the Crown as a\r\nsocial and popular factor is the knowledge which all statesmen and\r\nconstitutional students now possess of the personal influence in\r\ndiplomacy and statecraft which was wielded by the late Queen Victoria\r\nand which the experience and tact of the new Monarch enabled him to also\r\ntest and prove. Side by side with these two elements in the situation\r\nwas the conviction which has now become fixed throughout the Empire that\r\nthe Crown is the pivot upon which its unity and future co-operation\r\nnaturally and properly turns; that the Sovereign is the one possible\r\ncentral figure of allegiance for all its scattered countries and\r\nworld-wide races; that without the Crown as the symbol of union and the\r\nKing as the living object of allegiance and personal sentiment the\r\nBritish realms would be a series of separated units.\r\n\r\nThese facts lend additional importance to the character and history of\r\nthe Monarchy; to the influences which have controlled the life and\r\nlabours of King Edward; to the abilities which have marked his career\r\nand the elements which have entered into the making of his character. He\r\nmay not in succeeding years of his reign have declared war like an\r\nEdward I., or made secret diplomatic arrangements like a Charles II. He\r\nmay not have manipulated foreign combinations like a William III., or\r\ndismissed his Ministers at pleasure like a George III., or worked one\r\nfaction in his Kingdom against another like a Charles I. None of these\r\nthings have been attempted, nor will his successor desire to undertake\r\nthem. But none the less there lay in his hand a vast and growing\r\npower--the personal influence wielded by a popular and experienced\r\nMonarch over his Ministry, his Court, his Diplomatic Staff throughout\r\nthe world, and his high officers in the Army and Navy. The prestige of\r\nhis personal honours or personal wishes and the known Imperialism of his\r\npersonal opinions must have had great weight in controlling Colonial\r\npolicy in London; while his experience of European and Eastern\r\nstatecraft through many years of close intercourse with foreign and home\r\nstatesmen undoubtedly had a marvelous effect in the control of British\r\npolicy abroad.\r\n\r\nTo the external Empire, as constituted at the beginning of the twentieth\r\ncentury, the Crown is a many-sided factor. The personal and diplomatic\r\ninfluence of the Sovereign is obvious and was illustrated by Queen\r\nVictoria in such historic incidents as the personal relations with King\r\nLouis Philippe which probably averted a war with France in the early\r\nforties; in the later friendship with Louis Napoleon which helped to\r\nmake the Crimean War alliance possible; in the refusal by the Queen to\r\nassent to a certain _casus belli_ despatch during the American War which\r\nsaved Great Britain from being drawn into the struggle; in her influence\r\nupon the Cabinet in connection with the Schleswig-Holstein question,\r\nwhich was exerted to such an extent (according to Lord Malmesbury) as to\r\nhave averted a possible conflict with Germany.\r\n\r\nThe political power of the Crown and its wearer is proven to exist in\r\nthe dismissal of Lord Palmerston for his rash recognition of the French\r\n_coup d'état_; in the occasional exercise of the right of excluding\r\ncertain individuals from the Government--notably the case of Mr.\r\nLabouchere a decade ago; in such direct exercise of influence as the\r\nQueen's intervention in the matter of the Irish Church Disestablishment\r\nBill as related by the late Archbishop Tait. The Imperial influence of\r\nthe Sovereign has been shown in more than merely indirect ways. The\r\nQueen's refusal to approve the first draft of the Royal Proclamation for\r\nIndia in 1858 and her changes in the text were declared by Lord Canning\r\nto have averted another insurrection. Her personal determination to send\r\nthe Prince of Wales to Canada in 1860 and her own visit to Ireland in\r\none of the last years of her reign were cases of actual initiative and\r\nactive policy. South Africa owed to the late Queen the several visits of\r\nthe Duke of Edinburgh and the exhibition of her well-known sympathy with\r\nthe views of Sir George Grey--who, had he been allowed a free hand,\r\nwould have consolidated and united those regions many years ago and\r\naverted the recent disastrous struggle.\r\n\r\nAustralia owed to her the compliment of various visits from members of\r\nthe Royal family, the kindly personal treatment of its leaders and a\r\nfrequently expressed desire for its unity in one great and growing\r\nnationality--British in allegiance and connection and power; Australian\r\nin local authority, patriotism and development. India was indebted to\r\nits Queen-Empress for continued sympathy and wise advice to its\r\nGovernors-General; for the phraseology in the Proclamation after the\r\nMutiny, already referred to, which rendered the new conditions of\r\nallegiance comprehensible and satisfactory to the native mind; for the\r\nimportant visit of the Prince of Wales to that country in 1877; and for\r\nthe support given to Lord Beaconfield's Imperial policy of asserting\r\nEngland's place in the world, of purchasing the Suez Canal shares in\r\norder to help in keeping the route to the East and of paving the way for\r\nthat acquisition of Egypt and the Soudan which has since made Cecil\r\nRhodes' dream of a great British-African empire a realizable\r\nprobability. The Colonies, as a whole, owed to Queen Victoria a\r\ncondition of government which made peaceful constitutional development\r\npossible; which extinguished discontent and the elements or embers of\r\nrepublicanism; which gradually eliminated the separative tendencies of\r\ndistance and slowly merged the Manchester school ideas of the past into\r\nthe Imperialism of the present; which made evolution rather than\r\nrevolution the guiding principle of British countries in the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONARCHY IN HISTORY\r\n\r\nHow has the Crown become such an important factor in the modern\r\ndevelopment of British peoples? The answer is not found altogether in\r\npersonal considerations nor even in those of loyalty to somewhat vague\r\nand undefined principles of government. These considerations have had\r\ngreat weight but so also has the traditional and actual power of the\r\nMonarchy in moulding institutions and ideas during a thousand years of\r\nhistory. To a much greater extent than is generally understood in these\r\ndemocratic days has this latter influence been a factor. Through nearly\r\nall British history the Sovereign has either represented the popular\r\ninstincts of the time or else led in the direction of extended territory\r\nand power under the individual influence of royal valour or statecraft.\r\nThe history of England has not, of course, been confined to the\r\nbiography of its Kings or Queens, but it would be as absurd to trace\r\nthose annals without extended study of the rulers and their characters\r\nas it would be to write the records without reference to the people and\r\npopular progress. And the Monarchy has done much for the British Isles.\r\nIts influence has effected their whole national life in war and in\r\npeace, in religion and in morals, in literature and in art. The\r\nindividual achievements and actions of some of these rulers constitute\r\nthe very foundation stones in the structure of modern British power.\r\nOthers again have helped to build the walls of the national edifice\r\nuntil the Sovereign at the beginning of the twentieth century has\r\nbecome the pivot upon which turns the constitutional unity of a great\r\nEmpire and which forms the only possible centre for a common allegiance\r\namongst its varied peoples.\r\n\r\nAt first this monarchical principle was embodied in the form of military\r\npower, was based upon feudal loyalty, and was associated with the noble\r\nideals, but somewhat reckless practices, of mediæval chivalry. The\r\nvictories of Egbert and Alfred the Great transformed the Heptarchy into\r\na substantial English Kingdom. The military skill of William the\r\nConqueror gave an opportunity to blend the graces of Norman chivalry,\r\nand a somewhat higher form of civilization, with the rougher virtues of\r\nthe Saxon character. Henry II. personally illustrated this combination,\r\nwith his ruddy English face and strong physical powers, and impressed\r\nhimself upon British history by the conquest of Ireland. Richard Coeur\r\nde Lion gave his country many famous pages of crusading in the East, and\r\nembodied in his life and character the adventurous and daring spirit of\r\nthe age. Edward I. dominated events by his energy and ability, subdued\r\nWales, and for a time conquered the Kingdom of Scotland. Edward III., in\r\nhis long reign of fifty years, carried the British flag over the fields\r\nof France, and won immortality at the battles of Crecy and Poictiers.\r\nHenry V. gained the victory of Agincourt, and won and wore the title of\r\nKing of France. Then came the Wars of the Roses and the turbulent\r\ntermination to a period of six centuries during which the English\r\nMonarchs had represented the military spirit of their times, and had led\r\nin the rough process of struggle and conquest out of which was growing\r\nthe United Kingdom of to-day.\r\n\r\nWith the reign of Henry VIII. commenced the period of religious\r\nchange--the struggles for religious liberty against ecclesiastical\r\ndominance. Limited as were the achievements of Henry and Elizabeth, in\r\nthis respect, by prevailing bigotry and narrowness of view as well as\r\nby diverse personal characteristics, they none the less did great\r\nservice to the country and the people. The rule of Cromwell--who, in the\r\nexercise of Royal power and the possession of regal personal ability,\r\nmay properly be included in such a connection--gave that liberty of\r\nworship to a portion of the masses with which previous Sovereigns had\r\nmore especially endowed the classes. During the reign of the Stuarts\r\nreligious dissensions and ecclesiastical controversies and intermittent\r\npersecutions, illustrated the predominant passion of the period; and\r\nforced the weak or indifferent monarch of the moment to be an\r\nunconscious factor in the progress towards that general toleration which\r\nthe Revolution of 1688 and the crowning of William and Mary finally\r\naccomplished. But, whether it was Henry persecuting the monks, or\r\nElizabeth the Roman Catholics, or Mary the Protestants, or Cromwell the\r\nEpiscopalians, or Charles II. the Dissenters, each ruler was being led,\r\nto a great degree, by the undercurrent of surrounding bigotry and was,\r\nin the main, representative of a strong, popular sentiment of the time.\r\nHenry voiced the national uprising against Rome, just as the second\r\nCharles embodied popular reaction against the Puritans, and as William\r\nof Orange was enabled to lead a successful opposition to the gloomy and\r\npersonal bigotry of the last of the Royal Stuarts.\r\n\r\nThe third period of British monarchical history in this connection was\r\nthat marked by the growth toward constitutional government under the\r\nsway of the House of Hanover. Coupled with this was the equally\r\nimportant foundation of a great Colonial empire, and the loss of a large\r\nportion of it in the reign of George III. But the development of\r\nconstitutional rule under the Georges should not be confounded with the\r\ngrowth of the popular and Imperial system which exists to-day. The\r\nlatter is simply a progressive evolution out of the aristocratic and\r\noligarchical government of the Hanoverian period, just as that system\r\nhad been a step from the kingly power of the Tudors and the Stuarts,\r\nwhich, in turn, had arisen upon the ruins of feudalism and military\r\nmonarchical power. It is this gradual growth, this \"gently broadening\r\ndown from precedent to precedent,\" which makes the British constitution\r\nof to-day the more or less perfected result of centuries of experience\r\nand struggle. But that result has only been made possible by a peculiar\r\nseries of national adjustments in which the power of the Monarchs has\r\nbeen modified from time to time to suit the will of the people, while\r\nthe ability of individual Sovereigns has been at the same time given\r\nfull scope in which to exercise wise kingcraft or pronounced military\r\nskill. It has, in fact, been a most elastic system in its application\r\nand to that elasticity has been due its prolonged stability of form\r\nunder a succession of dynastic or personal changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION AND THE MONARCHY\r\n\r\nIt is a common mistake to minimize the importance and value of the\r\naristocratic rule by which the government of England was graded down\r\nfrom the high exercise of royal power under the Tudors and Stuarts to\r\nthat beneficial exercise of royal influence which marks the opening of\r\nthe present century period. To the aristocracy of those two centuries is\r\nmainly due the fact that the growth from paternal government and\r\npersonal rule to direct popular administration was a gradual\r\ndevelopment, through only occasional scenes of storm and stress, instead\r\nof involving a succession of revolutions alternating with civil war.\r\nSomers and Godolphin, Walpole and Chatham, Pitt and Shelburne, Eldon and\r\nCanning, Grey and Liverpool, Wellington and Durham, Melbourne and\r\nPalmerston, were all of this aristocratic class, though of varying\r\ndegrees in rank and title and with varied views of politics. They filled\r\nthe chief places in the Government of the country during a period when\r\nthe people were being slowly trained in the perception and practice of\r\nconstitutional and religious liberty. At the best such processes are\r\ndifficult and often prove bitter tests of national endurance; and it was\r\nwell for Great Britain that the two centuries under review produced a\r\nclass of able and cultured men who--though naturally aristocratic at\r\nheart--were upon the whole honestly bent upon furthering the best\r\ninterests of the masses. And this despite the mistakes of a Danby or a\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nYet, even towards the close of this period of preparation, popular\r\ngovernment, as now practised, was neither understood by the immediate\r\npredecessors of Queen Victoria, nor by the nobles who presided over the\r\nchanging administrations of the day. It was not clearly comprehended by\r\nLiberals like Russell and Grey; it was feared by Wellington and the\r\nTories as being republican and revolutionary; it was dreaded by many who\r\ncould hardly be called Tories and who, in the condition of things then\r\nprevalent, could scarcely even be termed Loyalists. Writing in 1812,\r\nCharles Knight, the historian, described the fierce national struggle of\r\nthe previous twenty years with Napoleon and expressed a longing wish for\r\nthe prop of a sincere and spontaneous loyalty to the throne in the\r\ncritical times that were to follow. But such a sentiment of loyalty was\r\nnot then expressed, and could hardly have been publicly evoked by a\r\nruler of the type of George IV., whether governing as Prince-Regent or\r\nas King.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no doubt of its having existed, and there seems to\r\nhave been, even through those troubled years, an inborn spirit of\r\nloyalty to the Crown as being the symbol of the State and of public\r\norder. Its wearer might make mistakes and be personally unpopular, but\r\nhe represented the nation as a whole and must consequently be respected.\r\nThis powerful feeling has often in English history made the bravest and\r\nstrongest submit to slights from their Sovereign, and has won the most\r\ndisinterested devotion and energetic action from men who have never\r\neven seen the Monarch in whose personal character there was sometimes\r\nlittle to evoke or deserve such faith and sacrifice. For ages this\r\nloyalty had been the preservative of society in England, and it is still\r\nindispensable to the tranquility and permanence of a state, whether\r\ngiven in its full degree to the Sovereign of Great Britain, or in a more\r\ndivided sense to the elective and partisan head of a modern republic.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Georges, as well as in the middle ages and at the\r\npresent moment, loyalty was and is a sincere and honest patriotism,\r\nrefining the instincts and elevating the actions of those who were\r\nwilling to waive self-interest on any given occasion in order to guard\r\nwhat they believed to be the true basis of national stability and order.\r\nCertainly, a Monarchy which could survive the wars and European\r\nrevolutions, the internal discontents and personal deficiencies, of the\r\nperiod which commenced with the reign of George I. and closed with that\r\nof William IV., must have possessed some inherent strength greater than\r\nmay be gathered from many of the superficial works which pass for\r\nhistory. But, whatever that influence was, it does not appear to have\r\nbeen personal. With the close of the reign of Queen Anne the brilliant\r\n_prestige_ of personal authority and power wielded by the Sovereign had\r\npassed quietly away and, up to the death of William IV. and the\r\naccession of Victoria, had not been replaced by the personal influence\r\nof a constitutional ruler.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENT POSITION OF THE MONARCHY\r\n\r\nOut of all these changing developments has come a military position in\r\nwhich the Sovereign no longer leads his forces in war but in which he\r\ncommands a sentiment of loyalty as hearty, in the breasts of the\r\nColonial soldiers ten thousand miles away from his home at Windsor, as\r\never did the personal presence of an Edward I., or a Richard the\r\nLion-Hearted. Out of them has come a religious position in which the\r\nSovereign is head of a particular Church and yet, as such, gives no\r\nserious offence to masses of his subjects who belong to other faiths and\r\nwho receive through his Governments around the world absolute freedom of\r\nreligious worship--almost as a matter of course. Out of the\r\nconstitutional evolution has come the adaptation of the Monarchy to not\r\nonly new conditions but to countries separated by oceans and continents\r\nfrom the mother-state, and the evolution of a system which combines\r\n420,000,000 people under one Crown and one flag. In August, 1884, the\r\n_Times_ spoke of a correspondent amongst the Khirgese of Central Asia\r\nwho stated that the people of that region had not the remotest idea of\r\nwhere or what England was--but they had heard of Queen Victoria; and a\r\nfew years later Mr. Henry Labouchere, the inconsistent and bitter\r\nRadical, told the _Forum_ of New York that \"were a Parliamentary\r\ncandidate to address an electoral meeting on the advantages of a\r\nrepublic he would be deemed a tilter at a windmill.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is a summary of the history and position of the British Monarchy. A\r\nthousand years ago it combined the seven little Kingdoms of England into\r\none; to-day it combines the Kingdoms and Dominions and Commonwealths and\r\nIslands of a quarter of the earth's surface into one. The power of the\r\nCrown was once chiefly employed in making war and compelling peace by\r\nforce of arms and military skill; to-day it is largely utilized in\r\npromoting peace and controlling diplomacy. The position of the Monarch\r\nwas once that of the head of a class, or the leader of some distinct\r\nmanifestation of public feeling, or the military chief of a great\r\nfaction; to-day it is that of embodying the power of a united people,\r\ngiving dignified interpretation to the policy of a nation, and serving\r\nas the symbol of unity to the masses of population in an extended\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting features in the Crown's popularity and influence\r\nis the absence of serious criticism or controversy over the expense of\r\nits maintenance. Perhaps the only practical expression of disapproval\r\naffecting the Monarchy heard during Queen Victoria's long reign was an\r\noccasional grumbling as to the paucity of Court functions, the absence\r\nof Royal splendour and expenditures from the City of London, the\r\nsombreness and quiet which characterized the ordinary, everyday life of\r\nthe Sovereign. The total financial cost of the Monarchy has been placed\r\nat a million pounds sterling per annum, but this total includes various\r\nlarge sums which could just as properly be charged to the ordinary\r\ngoverning requirements of the country without reference to the\r\nparticular form of its institutions. Against this sum may also be placed\r\nthe proceeds of the Crown Lands which were surrendered to Parliament\r\nupon the accession of William and Mary and which had before that been\r\nrecognized as a personal estate of the Sovereign over which Parliament\r\nhad no control. In addition to these Crown Land revenues other sums were\r\nvoted as required. Upon their surrender to the nation (during the life\r\nof each Sovereign) it has become the custom, since 1868, to vote a\r\npermanent Civil List for the ensuing reign and out of this sum the\r\nordinary Court and personal expenses are supposed to be met. In the case\r\nof Queen Victoria the amount was £385,000 a year, supplemented, however,\r\nby other votes and special allowances to herself and the Royal family\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nUpon her accession the Queen retained out of the old Crown Lands, or\r\nrevenues, those of the Duchy of Lancaster and they have risen in value\r\nfrom £20,000 to £50,000 per annum. The Royal palaces are maintained\r\napart from the Civil List and the building of Royal yachts and other\r\nsimilar expenses are considered as additional items. The revenues of the\r\nDuchy of Cornwall, which have always pertained to the Prince of Wales,\r\nand the incomes or special sums voted to the members of the Royal\r\nfamily, make up an amount nearly as large as the Civil List. But these\r\napparently large sums have not in recent years created any feeling of\r\ndissatisfaction; nor has any been expressed save by certain individuals\r\nof the Labouchere type, who possess little influence and less sincerity.\r\nUpon the whole the situation in this connection possesses considerable\r\ninterest to the student of history, or of popular sentiment, as showing\r\nhow a practical, business-loving, money-making people can become devoted\r\nto an institution which must in the nature of things be expensive and\r\nwhich, in the ratio of its dignity and effectiveness as an embodiment of\r\ngrowing national power, must be increasingly so as the years roll on.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this condition of feeling is the combination which the\r\nMonarchy has during the past century come to present to the minds of the\r\npublic. Tradition and history reaching down into the hearts and lives of\r\nthe people may be considered the basic influence; a general belief in\r\nthe superiority of British institutions over all others may be stated as\r\na powerful conservative force; while personality and character in the\r\nSovereign may be described as the chief constructive element in this\r\nprocess of increasing loyalty to the Crown. Convenience, custom, love of\r\nceremony, belief in stability and aversion to change, are lesser factors\r\nwhich may be mentioned. The result is that Mr. George W. Smalley, for so\r\nmany years the American correspondent of the New York _Tribune_ in\r\nLondon, could write recently in the _Century_ the belief of a foreigner\r\nand a republican that \"England is a very democratic country, but there\r\ndoes not exist in England the vestige of a republican party.\"\r\n\r\nKing Edward, therefore, came to the throne of Great Britain and its\r\nEmpire at a time when the influence of the Sovereign was growing in\r\nproportion as the influence and popularity of Parliament appeared to be\r\nwaning. Fifty years before his accession it was a truism to assert that\r\npower in England was being steadily concentrated in the House of\r\nCommons; to-day it may be said with equal truth that the position of the\r\nCrown is growing steadily in a power which is wielded by personal\r\ninfluence and popularity and which, while it touches no privilege, nor\r\nright, nor liberty of Parliament, increases in proportion as the latter\r\nbody is relegated to the back-ground by public opinion and popular\r\ninterest. Vast responsibility, therefore, rests to-day in the hands of a\r\nBritish Sovereign and the results for good or ill, depend largely upon\r\nhis character, his training, his previous career and his present sense\r\nof duty. Alarm has even been expressed upon this point by historical\r\ntheorists such as Professor Beesly and Dr. Goldwin Smith. Certain it is,\r\nhowever, that in the hands of King Edward this growing power was safe.\r\nIf prolonged experience and acquired statecraft and intimate knowledge\r\nof his people can be considered sufficient guarantees for its exercise,\r\nit is also safe in the hands of King George.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEarly Years and Education of the Prince\r\n\r\n\r\nThe married life of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort was one of the\r\nhappiest recorded in history or known in the private annals of\r\nindividual lives. It was a love-match from the first and it lasted to\r\nthe end as one of those beautiful illustrations of harmony in the home\r\nwhich go far in a materialistic and selfish age to point to higher\r\nideals and to conserve the best principles of a Christian people. His\r\naffection was shown in myriad ways of devoted care and help; her feeling\r\nwas well stated in a letter to Baron Stockmar--\"There cannot exist a\r\npurer, dearer, nobler being in the world than the Prince.\" From such a\r\nunion was born Albert Edward, the future King and Emperor, on November\r\n9th, 1841. The Queen's first child had been the Princess Royal, and\r\nthere was naturally some hope that the next would be a male heir to the\r\nThrone. There was much public rejoicing over the event which was\r\nannounced from Buckingham Palace at mid-day of the date mentioned; the\r\nPrivy Council met and ordered a thanksgiving service; the national\r\nanthem was sung with enthusiasm in the theatres and public places;\r\ntelegrams of congratulation poured in from Princes abroad and peers and\r\npeasants at home; and _Punch_ perpetrated verses which well illustrated\r\nthe public feeling:\r\n\r\n    \"Huzza! we've a little Prince at last\r\n      A roaring Royal boy;\r\n    And all day long the booming bells\r\n      Have rung their peels of joy.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 8th following, the little Prince was created by\r\nletters-patent Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester--the titles of Prince\r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Duke of Saxony, Duke\r\nof Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron Renfrew, Lord of\r\nthe Isles and Prince, or Great Steward of Scotland, being his already by\r\nvirtue of his mother being the reigning Sovereign at the time of his\r\nbirth. During six hundred years there had been from time to time a\r\nPrince of Wales. The first was the son of Edward I., but the title was\r\nnever made hereditary, and there have been periods, totalling altogether\r\n288 years, in which it lay dormant. The Black Prince was perhaps the\r\nbest known of the line. The new Prince of Wales--destined to hold the\r\ndesignation for nearly sixty years and to make it one of the best known\r\nin the world--was solemnly baptized on January 25th, 1842, in St.\r\nGeorge's Chapel, Windsor, by the simple names of Albert Edward. The\r\nfirst was after his father, the second in memory of the Queen's father,\r\nthe Duke of Kent. The scene was one of splendour, and the uniforms and\r\nglittering orders and gleaming gems and beautiful dresses harmonized\r\nwell with the stately setting of the Chapel Royal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GORGEOUS CHRISTENING CEREMONY\r\n\r\nBesides the Royal party, which included Frederick William IV., King of\r\nPrussia, there were a throng of Ambassadors, Knights of the Garter,\r\nMembers of the Privy Council, Peers and Peeresses, statesmen and heads\r\nof the Church. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of\r\nLondon, Winchester, Oxford and Norwich were in special attendance, and\r\nthe sponsors for the young Prince were the King of Prussia, the Duchess\r\nof Kent (proxy for the Duchess of Saxe-Cobourg), the Duke of Cambridge\r\n(proxy for the Duchess of Saxe-Gotha), Princess Augusta of Cambridge\r\n(proxy for Princess Sophia) and Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Cobourg. The\r\ncost of this gorgeous christening ceremony and attendant functions was\r\nsaid to have been fully two million dollars. A part of this was,\r\nhowever, due to the entertainments accorded King Frederick William IV.,\r\nwho, as the chief Protestant monarch of the Continent, was given a\r\nparticularly cordial and elaborate welcome. In connection with the\r\nchristening of the future King it is interesting to note that an\r\necclesiastical newspaper, of Toronto, called _The Church_, referred to\r\nthe event on March 19th, 1842, and declared that should the Prince live\r\nto be King he would be known as Edward VII. On February 3rd Queen\r\nVictoria opened Parliament in person with the following as the\r\npreliminary words in the Speech from the Throne: \"I cannot meet you in\r\nParliament assembled without making a public acknowledgment of my\r\ngratitude to Almighty God on account of the birth of the Prince, my son;\r\nan event which has completed the measure of my domestic happiness and\r\nhas been hailed with every manifestation of affectionate attachment to\r\nmy person and Government by my faithful and loyal people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHILDHOOD OF THE PRINCE\r\n\r\nThe early events of the Prince's life were followed with much interest\r\nby the public and with a personal and individual feeling which grew in\r\nvolume with the ever-increasing popularity of the young Queen. The Court\r\nin those years was a gay one and events such as the Queen's famous\r\nPlantagenet Ball of 1842; the state visit to King Louis Philippe of\r\nFrance in 1843; the coming of Nicholas I., Czar of all the Russias, to\r\nthe Court of St. James in 1844, followed a little later by William,\r\nPrince of Prussia--afterwards William I. of Germany, and by a return\r\nvisit of the King and Queen of the French; kept the social demands of\r\nthe period up to a very high pitch. Yet the quiet, careful surroundings\r\nof an almost ideal home were given to the young Prince and to those who\r\nafterwards came to the family circle, by a mother who, in the midst of\r\nmany national cares and private anxieties could write to her\r\nmuch-respected friend and uncle--Leopold of Belgium--that \"my happiness\r\nat home, the love of my husband, his kindness, his advice, his support\r\nand his company make up for all and make me forget all.\"\r\n\r\nThe Princess Victoria, afterwards for a brief year Empress of Germany,\r\nhad been born on November 21, 1840; the Prince of Wales was the next\r\nchild; the Princess Alice, who afterwards married the Grand Duke of\r\nHesse, was born on April 25, 1843; Prince Alfred--Duke of Edinburgh and\r\nof Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in later years--followed on August 6, 1844; the\r\nPrincess Helena came next on May 25, 1846, and afterwards became the\r\nwife of Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; the Princess Louise, who\r\nmarried the Marquess of Lorne and future Duke of Argyll, was born on\r\nMarch 18, 1848; Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, followed on May 1,\r\n1850; Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, on April 7, 1853; Princess\r\nBeatrice, afterwards wife and widow of Prince Henry of Battenberg, was\r\nborn on April 14, 1857, and completed the Royal family for the time.\r\n\r\nThe greatest care and attention was given to the youthful Prince.\r\nWriting to King Leopold soon after his birth--on December 7, 1841--the\r\nQueen had said: \"I wonder very much who my little boy will be like. You\r\nwill understand how fervent are my prayers, and I am sure every one's\r\nmust be, to see him resemble his father in every respect, both in body\r\nand mind.\" From the earliest period the child grew into his life of\r\nceremony and state, but it was a process carefully graded to suit the\r\ndevelopment of natural faculties. Nothing appears to have been allowed\r\nto unduly burden his gradual growth in experience and knowledge and\r\ncertainly a more pleasant domestic environment and life could hardly be\r\nimagined. At a later period his studies were so varied in character as\r\nto excite some slight apprehension in a part of the public mind.\r\n\r\nThe first public appearance of the Prince was on February 4, 1842, when\r\nthe Queen was inspecting some troops near Windsor and the babe was held\r\nup by his nurse from a window of the Castle so that the crowd could see\r\nhim. He has been described in many prints and stories as being a very\r\nlively infant and child. Lady Lyttelton[1], a sister to Mrs. Gladstone,\r\nwas in charge of the Royal nursery as a sort of trusted Governess during\r\nthe first six years of his life and everything was conducted with\r\nregularity and care. The Queen personally supervised the arrangements,\r\nwhether for instruction, pleasure or exercise, though she often had to\r\nexpress in diary or letter her regret at not being able to be as much\r\nwith her children as she desired. Simplicity was, perhaps, the guiding\r\nprinciple of this early training, though it was combined with a certain\r\namount of familiarity in matters of ceremony and formality. In\r\nSeptember, 1843, when the Queen and Prince Consort were in France the\r\nRoyal children were at Brighton in charge of Lady Lyttelton and the\r\npeople used to take great delight in waiting for the daily outing of the\r\nlittle Prince and his sister and the presentation of a loyal salute by\r\nthe raising of hats and the waving of handkerchiefs. The child had been\r\ntaught to raise his chubby fist to his forehead in reply and a\r\njournalist of the time veraciously declares that he did it with \"evident\r\nenjoyment and infantile dignity.\" A little later, on December 20th, a\r\nparty of nine Ojibbeway Indians were presented to the Queen at Windsor\r\nCastle and the Chief gravely referred to the toddling Royal infant in\r\nhis speech as \"the very big little White Father whose eyes are like the\r\nsky that sees all things and who is fat with goodness like a winter\r\nbear.\"\r\n\r\nAnother attractive event in these annals of childhood was a visit of Tom\r\nThumb to Buckingham Palace on March 23, 1844. Not long afterwards, on\r\nJune 5th, the little Prince saw his first Review, on the occasion of the\r\nEmperor of Russia's visit, and clapped his hands and shouted at the\r\nsplendid spectacle. On March 24, 1846, he was given that first and\r\ngreatest pleasure of all children, a visit to the circus (Astley's). He\r\napplauded liberally and when the clown was brought to the Royal box at\r\nhis request, the little Prince gravely shook hands with him and thanked\r\nhim \"for making me laugh so much.\" Similar stories might be multiplied\r\nin many pages. Every trifling incident of the Royal childhood seems,\r\nindeed, to have been treasured by some one. Late in 1846 a visit was\r\nmade on the _Victoria and Albert_ yacht to the coast of Cornwall and,\r\nafter the landing, the Royal party went to Penrhyn where the little\r\nPrince, as Duke of Cornwall, was formally welcomed by Mayor and\r\nCorporation as their feudal lord. In August of the succeeding year he\r\nwas taken by the Queen and Prince Consort on a tour around the west\r\ncoast of Scotland and during a visit to Cluny Macpherson's Scottish\r\nhome, he received one of the first of a multitude of interesting\r\npresents--a ring containing a miniature of Prince Charles Stuart. In\r\nAugust 1844, he accompanied his parents on a visit to Ireland, where he\r\nmet with splendid acclamation from the people and was created Earl of\r\nDublin by the Queen. It has been said that the reception was so\r\nenthusiastic as to have left a profound impression on the child's mind.\r\n\r\nOn October 30, 1849, when nearly eight years old, the Prince of Wales\r\nperformed his first public function. Accompanied by the little Princess\r\nRoyal and his father he proceeded in state from Westminister in a Royal\r\nbarge rowed by watermen. All London turned out to see the youthful\r\nroyalties--\"Puss and the boy\" as the Queen called them in her Diary--and\r\nLady Lyttelton in a letter to Mrs. Gladstone has left a charming picture\r\nof the pleasure expressed by the little Prince at his reception and at\r\nthe various quaint customs revived for the occasion. It was at this\r\ntime that Miss Louisa Alcott, author of _Little Women_, wrote home that\r\nthe Prince was \"a yellow-haired laddie, very like his mother. Fanny and\r\nI nodded and waived as he passed and he openly winked his boyish eye at\r\nus, for Fanny with her yellow curls waving looked rather rowdy and the\r\npoor little Prince wanted some fun.\" Two years later, on May 1st, the\r\nyouthful Heir to the Throne assisted the Queen at the brilliant\r\nceremonies attending the opening of the first and great Exhibition of\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY EDUCATION OF THE PRINCE\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the important matter of education had been occupying the\r\nattention of the Queen and her husband. After careful inquiry during\r\nnearly a year the Rev. Henry Mildred Birch was selected and on April 10,\r\n1844, the Prince Consort wrote, in a private and family letter, that\r\n\"Bertie will be given over in a few weeks into the hands of a tutor whom\r\nwe have found in Mr. Birch, a young, good-looking, amiable man who was a\r\ntutor at Eton and who not only himself took the highest honours at\r\nCambridge but whose pupils have also won special distinction. It is an\r\nimportant step and God's blessing be upon it, for upon the good\r\neducation of princes and especially of those who are destined to govern,\r\nthe welfare of the world in these days very greatly depends.\" This\r\ngentleman acted until 1852 when, upon the advice of Sir James Stephen,\r\nthe appointment was given to Mr. Frederick W. Gibbs, who retained it for\r\nthe succeeding six years. In special lines of study such as Art and\r\nMusic there were various instructors for the young Prince as well as for\r\nthe rest of the family--the Rev. Charles Tarver being his classical\r\ntutor, Sir Edwin Landseer an instructor in the art of painting and Mr.\r\nE. H. Corbould his teacher in water-colours.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of the Prince of Wales in these childhood days vary\r\ngreatly; probably in natural accordance with the variable temperament\r\nof his age. Lady Lyttelton who, perhaps, knew him best, described him to\r\nMr. Greville in 1852--though that interesting _litterateur_ is not\r\nalways reliable--as being \"extremely shy and timid, with very good\r\nprinciples and, particularly, an exact observer of truth.\" The\r\ndescription is, however, so much in harmony with his bringing up that it\r\nmay well be accepted as accurate. These years, however, passed rapidly\r\naway in a commingling of instruction, ceremonial and innocent\r\nrecreation. The Baroness Bunsen in her _Memoirs_ gives a pleasant\r\npicture which illustrates the character of the amusements current in the\r\nRoyal family at their different homes at Windsor, Osborne, or Balmoral.\r\nThis particular incident was a Masque devised by the children, when\r\nPrince \"Bertie\" was twelve years old, in honour of the anniversary of\r\ntheir parents' marriage. The Prince who represented Winter and was clad\r\nin a coat covered with imitation icicles, recited some verses from\r\nThomson's Seasons. Princess Alice was Spring; the Princess Royal,\r\nSummer; Prince Alfred, Autumn; while Princess Helena, representing St.\r\nHelena, the traditional mother of Constantine and native of Britain,\r\ncalled down Heaven's benediction upon the Royal couple.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Prince of Wales made his first appearance in the\r\nHouse of Lords, sitting beside the Queen as she received Addresses from\r\nParliament concerning the impending war with Russia. He seems to have\r\ntaken a keen interest in that conflict and, in March 1855, went with his\r\nparents to visit the wounded at Chatham Military Hospital. In August he\r\naccompanied the Queen and Prince Consort upon the first visit paid by an\r\nEnglish Sovereign to Paris since the days of Henry II. and shared in the\r\nsplendid reception given by the Emperor Napoleon and the French people.\r\nEven here, however, his tutor was with him and idleness or pleasure was\r\nnot allowed to occupy the field entirely. With the Princess Royal, he\r\nwas present at a splendid ball given in Versailles--the first since the\r\ndays of Louis XVI--and they sat down at supper with the Emperor and\r\nEmpress. The young Prince enjoyed the visit so much and liked his\r\nImperial hosts so well--a liking which he never forgot in later years of\r\nsorrow and suffering--that he begged the Empress to get leave for his\r\nsister and himself to stay a little longer. The Queen and his father, he\r\nexplained, had six more children at home and they could, he thought, do\r\nwithout them for a while.\r\n\r\nOf course, this was not possible. The Prince Consort, however, was\r\ngreatly pleased with the way in which the children had behaved and wrote\r\nto Baron Stockmar, shortly after, expressing his belief that the Prince\r\nhad been a general favourite. To the Duchess of Kent he wrote that \"the\r\ntask was no easy one for them but they discharged it without\r\nembarrassment and with natural simplicity.\" From this it is evident that\r\nthe shyness spoken of by Lady Lyttelton had largely passed away from the\r\nmanner of the Prince. During this year the latter--now fourteen years\r\nold--took an incognito walking tour through the west of England\r\naccompanied by Mr. Gibbs and Colonel Cavendish. The next two or three\r\nyears were spent in a happy life of mixed pursuits in England and\r\nScotland, or in travel abroad, alternating, according to the place and\r\nseason, between fishing and shooting, ponies and picnics, deer-stalking\r\nand juvenile dances, studies, tours and occasional functions. Many\r\npictures of the Royal family in these days of childhood and youth have\r\nbeen preserved from the brushes of Winterhalter, Richmond, Landseer,\r\nSaul and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATER EDUCATION OF THE PRINCE\r\n\r\nNot the least important of the educative influences of this period were\r\nthe tours undertaken by the young Prince. In the autumn of 1856,\r\naccompanied by those who could best instruct him in the matters\r\nwitnessed, he visited the great seats of industry in Provincial England\r\nincluding mills, ironworks, coal mines and engineering centres. In April\r\n1857 he enjoyed a tour through the beautiful Lake region and especially\r\nappreciated the hill-climbing in Cumberland. During June he accompanied\r\nthe Queen on a state visit to Manchester and witnessed the first\r\ndistribution of the Victoria Cross medals in Hyde Park, London. In July\r\nthe Prince left England for Konigswinter with a short European tour in\r\nview for \"purposes of study,\" as the Prince Consort put it in a private\r\nletter. With him were General Grey, Colonel (afterwards Sir Henry)\r\nPonsonby, his tutors and Dr. Armstrong. During the tour several young\r\nmen joined him as companions--the late Mr. W. H. Gladstone; Mr. Charles\r\nWood, now Lord Halifax; Mr. Frederick Stanley, now Earl of Derby and\r\nGovernor-General of Canada; and the present Earl Cadogan, Viceroy of\r\nIreland. The Prince on this occasion went up the Rhine and through\r\nGermany and Switzerland. Upon his return, in October, he attended\r\nlectures on science by Dr. Faraday while continuing his regular studies.\r\nEarly in the succeeding year he attended the marriage of his sister, the\r\nPrincess Royal, to the Prussian Prince who afterwards became the Emperor\r\nFrederick, and parted from the sister \"Vicky,\" to whom he was much\r\nattached, with evident sorrow.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 1858, when nearly seventeen years of age, the Prince was\r\nconfirmed in the Chapel Royal at Windsor. Writing of this ceremony, the\r\nPrince Consort observed to Baron Stockmar that Lord Derby, Lord\r\nPalmerston and Lord John Russell were amongst those who were present and\r\nthat the event \"went off with great solemnity and, I hope, with an\r\nabiding impression on his mind.\" At the examination before the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury and his Royal parents the Prince was described\r\nas acquitting himself \"extremely well.\" On the succeeding day he took\r\nthe Sacrament. Shortly afterwards followed a two weeks walking tour in\r\nthe south of Ireland in which the Prince was accompanied by Mr. Gibbs,\r\nCaptain de Ros--afterwards Lieutenant-General Lord de Ros--and Dr.\r\nMinter. Succeeding this came a short period of steady study and the\r\nformal establishment of the young Prince at White Lodge in Richmond\r\nPark, under the tuition of Mr. Gibbs and Mr. Tarver and with three\r\ncompanions carefully selected by his father--Lord Valletort, the present\r\n(1902) Earl of Mount Edgecumbe, Major Teesdale V.C. and Major Lindsay\r\nV.C. Of the first named the Prince Consort wrote privately that he had\r\nbeen much on the Continent and was \"a thoroughly good, moral and\r\naccomplished man,\" who had passed his youth in attendance on his invalid\r\nfather. He also referred to the manner in which Major Teesdale had\r\ndistinguished himself at Kars and Major Lindsay at Alma and Inkerman and\r\nof the latter said: \"He is studious in his habits, lives little with the\r\nother young officers, is fond of study and familiar with French and\r\nItalian.\"[2] These considerations are interesting as indicating with\r\nwhat care the companions of the young Prince were selected by his wise\r\nfather from time to time. Here the Prince had, amongst his elements of\r\ninstruction, lectures on History from the Rev. Charles Kingsley, the\r\nwell-known author of _Westward Ho_ and, for ten years following,\r\nProfessor of History at Cambridge. They were given by special desire of\r\nthe Queen and must have proved deeply interesting. Canon Kingsley was,\r\nduring the rest of his life, an object of special liking to the Prince\r\nand always an honoured guest at Sandringham and Marlborough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD, PRINCE OF WALES, AT THE AGE OF SEVEN\r\n  In Sailor's Dress]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD, PRINCE OF WALES, AGED FIVE\r\n  Represents the Prince as feeding a pet rabbit]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD, PRINCE OF WALES, AGED SIXTEEN\r\n  In Highland costume]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE YOUTHFUL EDWARD, PRINCE OF WALES, 1859]\r\n\r\nOn November 9, 1859, the Prince of Wales completed his eighteenth year\r\nand attained his legal majority. The Queen wrote him a letter which\r\nCharles Greville, in his _Diary_, describes as \"one of the most\r\nadmirable ever penned.\" On the same day he was appointed a Colonel in\r\nthe Army and given the Order of the Garter--that most distinguished of\r\nall orders of knighthood. At the same time Colonel the Hon. Robert\r\nBruce, brother of the Lord Elgin who had proved so successful a\r\nGovernor-General of Canada and India, was appointed Governor to the\r\nPrince and was described by the Prince Consort as possessing amiability\r\nwith great mildness of expression and as being \"full of ability.\" He had\r\nbeen Military Secretary to Lord Elgin in Canada and was at this time in\r\ncommand of a battalion in the Grenadier Guards.[3] A month later the\r\nPrince started on a Continental tour accompanied by the Rev. Mr. Tarver\r\nas his chaplain and director of studies. He stayed some time in Rome,\r\nwhere he visited the Pope, on May 7 reached Gibraltar, and from thence\r\nvisited the south of Spain and Lisbon. He reached home in the middle of\r\nJune and took up a serious course of study at Edinburgh, with the late\r\nLord Playfair as his instructor in chemistry, and with other equally\r\ndistinguished teachers in specific lines or subjects. The public was at\r\nthis time taking much interest in these studies of the Heir Apparent and\r\nfear was expressed that he might, perhaps, be over-educated. _Punch_\r\nexpressed this feeling in the following lines:\r\n\r\n    \"To the south from the north, from the shores of the Forth,\r\n    Where at hands Presbyterian pure science is quaffed,\r\n    The Prince, in a trice, is whipped to the Isis,\r\n    Where Oxford keeps springs mediæval on draught.\r\n\r\n         *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    Dipped in grey Oxford mixture (lest _that_ be a fixture),\r\n    The poor lad's to be plunged in less orthodox Cam.,\r\n    Where dynamics and statics, and pure mathematics,\r\n    Will be piled on his brain's awful cargo of cram.\"\r\n\r\nAfter three months of Edinburgh training the Prince Consort went down\r\nand held a sort of conference with the teachers. He wrote as to the\r\nresult[4] that they all spoke highly of their pupil, who seemed to have\r\nshown zeal and goodwill. \"Dr. Lyon Playfair is giving him lectures on\r\nchemistry in relation to manufactures and, at the close of each special\r\ncourse, he visits the appropriate manufactory with him so as to explain\r\nits practical application. Dr. Schmitz gives him lectures on Roman\r\nhistory. Italian, German and French are advanced at the same time; and\r\nthree times a week the Prince exercises with the 16th Hussars who are\r\nstationed in the city.\" It was of this period that Sir Wemyss Reid, in\r\nhis biography of Lord Playfair, tells an amusing story. The Prince and\r\nDr. Playfair were standing near a cauldron containing lead which was\r\nboiling at white heat. \"Has Your Royal Highness any faith in science,\"\r\nsaid the Professor and the reply was, \"Certainly.\" The latter then\r\ncarefully washed the Prince's hand with ammonia and said:\r\n\r\n\"Will you now place your hand in this boiling metal and ladle out a\r\nportion of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you tell me to do this?\" asked the Prince.\r\n\r\nThe answer was in the affirmative and the Prince instantly put his hand\r\ninto the boiling mass and ladled out some of it without sustaining any\r\ninjury. Following this period of study at Edinburgh University came the\r\ncelebration of the Prince's nineteenth birthday and a hunting party in\r\nthe Highlands. Thence the Prince went to Oxford for a time and was\r\nadmitted a member of Christ Church College where he joined freely in the\r\nsocial life and sports of the institution. On January 16, 1861, after\r\nhis return from Canada, he became an under-graduate of Trinity College,\r\nCambridge, and was allowed, by special favour, to live in a neighbouring\r\nvillage with his Governor--Colonel Bruce. Here lectures were again given\r\nto the Prince by Canon Kingsley and the young man was kept pretty close\r\nto his studies during the winter of that year. In the summer he went on\r\nmilitary duty in Ireland and the Queen thus recorded in her _Diary_ a\r\nvisit paid to him at Curragh on August 26th: \"At a little before three\r\nwe went to Bertie's hut which is, in fact, Sir George Brown's. It is\r\nvery comfortable--a nice little bedroom, sitting-room, drawing-room, and\r\na good sized dining-room where we lunched, with our whole party. Col.\r\nPercy commands the Guards and Bertie is placed specially under him. I\r\nspoke to him and thanked him for treating Bertie as he did, just like\r\nany other officer, for I know that he keeps him up to his work in a way,\r\nas General Bruce told me, that no one else had done; and yet Bertie\r\nlikes him very much.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF THE PRINCE CONSORT\r\n\r\nThis was the last birthday of the Prince Consort and it was spent\r\ntravelling to Killarney with the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the\r\nyounger members of the Royal family. A few days there and then the young\r\nPrince returned to camp. In the autumn he visited the Rhine manoeuvres\r\nof the German army and met his future bride, the Princess Alexandra. He\r\nthen returned to Cambridge and from thence journeyed in haste to Windsor\r\non December 13th to be present at his father's death-bed on the\r\nfollowing evening. No sadder event has occurred in the history of\r\nEnglish royalty than this premature and much-mourned death of the good\r\nand really great Prince Consort. To the young Heir Apparent it meant the\r\nloss of a loving father, a careful guardian, a watchful and wise\r\nadviser. To the wife and widow it meant the ruin of a great happiness\r\nand a sorrow which no passing years could ever remove. Sir Theodore\r\nMartin's beautiful description of the scene at the death-bed, at which\r\nknelt the Queen, the Princess Alice, the Princess Helena and the Prince\r\nof Wales, may well be given here: \"In the solemn hush of that mournful\r\nchamber there was such grief as has rarely hallowed any death-bed. A\r\ngreat light, which had blessed the world, and which the mourners had\r\nbut yesterday hoped might long bless it, was waning fast away. A\r\nhusband, a father, a friend, a master, endeared by every quality by\r\nwhich man in such relations can win the love of his fellow-man, was\r\npassing into the Silent Land, and his loving glance, his wise counsels,\r\nhis firm, manly thought should be known among them no more. The Castle\r\nclock chimed the third quarter after ten. Calm and peaceful grew the\r\nbeloved form; the features settled into the beauty of a perfectly serene\r\nrepose; two or three long, but gentle breaths were drawn; and that great\r\nsoul had fled to seek a nobler scope for its aspirations in the world\r\nwithin the veil, for which it had often yearned, where there is rest for\r\nthe weary, and where 'the spirits of the just are made perfect.'\"\r\n\r\nNot long before his death the Prince Consort had readily agreed to his\r\nson's wish for a visit to the Holy Land and had planned the\r\npreliminaries of the tour before he was stricken by the disease which\r\ncarried him off. After that sad event it was felt by the Queen that such\r\na journey would now be doubly wise and proper and she made arrangements\r\nfor General Bruce to accompany the Prince, together with Major Teesdale,\r\nCaptain Keppel and a small suite. By special wish of the Prince Consort\r\nand at the urgent request of the Queen, the Rev. Dr. Arthur Penrhyn\r\nStanley consented to accompany the Prince. He joined the Royal party at\r\nAlexandria on February 28, 1862, and they at once proceeded to Cairo and\r\nfrom thence visited the Pyramids. A little later Palestine was reached\r\nand, following in the historic steps of Richard Coeur de Lion and\r\nEdward I., another Heir to the British Throne finally reached Jerusalem.\r\nThe closely-guarded Cave of Macphelah was opened to the Prince of Wales\r\nas well as the famous Mosque of Hebron which for nearly seven hundred\r\nyears had been closed to even Royal visitors. Lake Tiberias, Bethany,\r\nBethlehem, the Groves of Jericho, were visited and some time was spent\r\nin tents upon the journey to Damascus. From thence the party traveled\r\nto Beyrout, visited Tyre and Sidon, and proceeded to Tripoli. The\r\njourney was made by the Prince so as to include Patmos, Ephesus, Smyrna,\r\nConstantinople, Athens and Malta. From every place where it was possible\r\nthe Prince collected flowers which he carefully sent to his sister, the\r\nPrincess Royal. Of His Royal Highness during this interesting tour Dean\r\nStanley put on record his opinion at the time: \"It is impossible not to\r\nlike him and to be constantly with him brings out his astonishing memory\r\nof names and persons.... I am more and more struck by the amiable and\r\nendearing qualities of the Prince.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Sarah, Lady Lyttelton, daughter of the second Earl Spencer and wife\r\nof the third Lord Lyttelton.

In some\r\nrespects the tour of the Prince of Wales, in 1860, through the scattered\r\nand disconnected Provinces of British America has wielded an influence\r\nfar out of proportion to the contemporary judgment of the event; beyond,\r\nperhaps, what the Queen and Prince Consort in their wise and patriotic\r\npolicy of the time hoped to achieve. It was, in reality, the first break\r\nin the hitherto steady progress of the Manchester school theory\r\nregarding ultimate Empire disruption; the first check given to the\r\nwidely accepted doctrine that the Colonies were of no use except for\r\ntrade and, in any case, were like the fruit which ripens only to fall\r\nfrom the parent stem.\r\n\r\nMr. Bright, Lord John Russell, Sir George Cornewall Lewis, Mr. Cobden,\r\nLord Ashburton, Lord Ellenborough, Lord Derby, and many others, were at\r\nthis time touched with the blight of these theories and to them there\r\nwas no sense, and nothing but expense, in trying to cultivate Colonial\r\nloyalty or promote Colonial co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL CONDITIONS IN 1860\r\n\r\nTo this school--and it was one embracing many able men and\r\nthinkers--trade was more important than any other consideration, and the\r\ngreatest object of external policy was the development of friendly\r\nrelations with the United States. American extension of territory was\r\nnot looked upon with alarm even when it took a slice of the Maine\r\nboundary and threatened trouble over that of Oregon. The Republic had\r\nnot yet gone in seriously for high protection and did not, therefore,\r\nvitally touch the pockets of patriots who could not foresee, even in\r\ntheir keen regard for commerce and its development, that trade and\r\nterritory were in the future to be most intimately related.\r\n\r\nThe Queen and Prince Consort did, however, understand something of the\r\nfuture of the Empire--dimly it might be but still effectively. It had\r\nbeen announced during the progress of the Crimean War that a Royal tour\r\nof British America might be arranged within a few years, and the\r\nCanadian Legislature, on May 14th, 1859, took advantage of the coming\r\ncompletion of the great Victoria Bridge across the St. Lawrence, at\r\nMontreal, to tender a formal invitation to the Sovereign herself to be\r\npresent at the opening ceremonies; to receive a personal tribute of the\r\nunwavering attachment of her subjects; and to more closely unite the\r\nbonds which attached the Province to the Empire. This unanimously-passed\r\naddress was taken to London by Mr. Speaker Henry Smith, and the response\r\nelicited was most favourable to the indirect request of the Assembly and\r\nLegislative Council--the initiative in the matter being due to a motion\r\nby the Hon. P. M. M. S. Vankoughnet in the latter House. The\r\nGovernor-General received a reply, dated January 30th, 1860, and signed\r\nby the Duke of Newcastle, Colonial Secretary, which stated that Her\r\nMajesty greatly regretted that her duties at the Seat of the Empire\r\nwould prevent so long an absence, but that it might be possible for H.\r\nR. H. the Prince of Wales to attend the ceremony at a later date. \"The\r\nQueen trusts that nothing may interfere with this arrangement for it is\r\nHer Majesty's sincere desire that the young Prince, on whom the Crown\r\nof this Empire will devolve, may have the opportunity of visiting that\r\nportion of her dominions from which this Address has proceeded and may\r\nbecome acquainted with a people in whose progress towards greatness, Her\r\nMajesty, in common with her subjects in Great Britain, feels a lively\r\nand enduring sympathy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE COMMENCES HIS TOUR\r\n\r\nPreparations were at once commenced in the British Provinces to properly\r\nreceive the Royal guest. By the 9th of July all arrangements in England\r\nhad been made, including the acceptance of an invitation to visit the\r\nUnited States--as a private gentleman under the title of Lord Renfrew.\r\nOn that date the Prince sailed from Plymouth in the ship _Hero_\r\nafter replying to a farewell address, when he declared that he was\r\nproceeding to \"the great possessions of the Queen in North America\r\nwith a lively anticipation of the pleasure which the sight of a noble\r\nland, great works of nature and human skill and a generous and active\r\npeople must produce.\" The Royal suite was composed of the Duke of\r\nNewcastle--practically guardian to the youthful Prince; the Earl of St.\r\nGermans, Lord Chamberlain to the Queen; General, the Hon. Robert Bruce;\r\nDr. Auckland and two Equerries--Major Teesdale, V.C., and Captain Grey.\r\n\r\nNewfoundland was first reached on July 23d. An enthusiastic reception\r\nwas given to the Royal visitor at St. John's by ringing bells, lusty\r\ncheers, waving flags and evening illuminations. The Prince was received\r\nby the Governor, Sir Alexander Bannerman, and then passed in procession\r\nthrough beautiful arches and decorations to Government House. A levée\r\nwas held, many addresses received and a collective reply given, in which\r\nthe Prince made the statement that \"I shall carry back a lively\r\nrecollection of the day's proceedings and your kindness to myself\r\npersonally; but, above all, of these hearty demonstrations of patriotism\r\nwhich prove your deep-rooted attachment to the great and free country\r\nof which we all glory to be called sons.\" A ride around the town\r\nfollowed, without ceremony, and in the evening a state dinner and ball\r\nwere given. The attendance at the latter was very large and the Prince\r\ndelighted everyone, and particularly the ladies, by dancing with evident\r\nzest and pleasure until three o'clock in the morning. During the day\r\nthus commenced he left the Island amid every evidence of popularity and\r\nloyalty--after accepting a handsome Newfoundland dog as a present from\r\nthe people and presenting Lady Bannerman with a set of jewels in\r\ncommemoration of his visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL AT HALIFAX\r\n\r\nThe Royal squadron arrived at Halifax on the morning of July 30th and,\r\ndespite unpleasant weather, the entire city turned out to welcome the\r\nQueen's son. The streets were lined by the regular soldiers and\r\nvolunteers and were beautifully decorated with arches, transparencies\r\nand evergreens. The arches numbered seventeen and included one which the\r\nRoman Catholic Archbishop Connolly had erected at his own expense. The\r\nPrince was received by His Excellency the Earl of Mulgrave--afterwards\r\nMarquess of Normanby--and Rear-Admiral Sir Alexander Milne,\r\nMajor-General Trollope and the members of the Provincial Government.\r\nMayor Caldwell read an address expressing \"devotion to the British\r\nthrone and attachment to British institutions\" and His Royal Highness in\r\nreply referred to the noble Harbour of Halifax in which all the navies\r\nof Great Britain could \"ride in safety.\" There was much enthusiasm shown\r\nin the streets and at one point 4000 children sang an adaptation of the\r\nNational Anthem as a sort of welcoming ode. At Government House the Hon.\r\nWilliam Young read an address from the Executive Council of the Province\r\nin which special reference was made to the Nova Scotians who had won\r\nlaurels \"beneath the Imperial flag\" in the recent Crimean campaign. It\r\nwas signed by the Hon. Joseph Howe, the Hon. A. G. Archibald, the Hon.\r\nJ. McCully, the Hon. William Annand and others and, in replying, the\r\nPrince made a significant allusion to the Confederation policy of\r\nseveral years later when he expressed hopes for their happiness as a\r\nloyal and united people.\r\n\r\nOn the following day a Royal review was held and in the evening a state\r\ndinner and ball were attended while illuminations turned the darkness of\r\nthe outside night into brightness. At the ball the ladies selected as\r\npartners, according to a contemporary historian, were \"principally the\r\nwives and daughters--much oftener the latter--of gentlemen connected\r\nwith the staff or with the Government of the Province.\" The same\r\nwriter[5] states that when the Prince adjourned to supper he begged that\r\nthe ball might not proceed in his absence \"as he would not be long away\r\nand his programme was full.\" The third day in Halifax included a Levée\r\nat Government House; the reception of the addresses from the Church of\r\nEngland, King's College, Windsor, the Masons, the Methodist Conference,\r\nthe Free Church of Scotland, the Kirk of Scotland, the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch, the Presbyterian Church, and Acadia College. A visit followed to\r\nthe one-time residence and grounds of H. R. H. the Duke of Kent and a\r\nRegatta was witnessed. A state dinner and reception at Government House,\r\na torch-light procession of Firemen and a display of fireworks in the\r\nevening closed the events of the visit. Early in the morning of August\r\n2nd, His Royal Highness left for St. John--stopping on the way at\r\nWindsor, which was beautifully decorated, to receive an address and\r\npartake of a banquet. An address was also accepted at Hautsport.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the Prince was welcomed at St. John by Mr.\r\nManners-Sutton, the Lieutenant-Governor, the members of the Government,\r\nthe Judges, etc. At one point during the procession to his temporary\r\nresidence 5000 school children sang patriotic airs and threw flowers at\r\ntheir Royal guest. The usual addresses and evening illuminations\r\nfollowed--the latter eclipsing those of Halifax, or St. John's,\r\nNewfoundland. August 4th and the Sunday which followed were spent at\r\nFredericton. The Anglican Cathedral was attended there and a sermon from\r\nBishop Medley listened to. On the following day the Executive Council\r\npresented an address in which it stated that \"if the necessity should\r\never arise all the available resources of New Brunswick will be freely\r\noffered for the defence of Imperial interests and the maintenance of\r\nnational honour.\" The address from the City referred to \"the universal\r\nheart-throb of our Empire of perpetual sunlight\" and another address was\r\npresented from the Anglican clergy. The Prince replied appropriately to\r\neach and afterwards held a Levée at Government House and attended a\r\ngrand ball held in his honour. On Tuesday, August 7th, he started from\r\nPrince Edward Island, being enthusiastically welcomed on the way at\r\nIndiantown and Carleton in New Brunswick, and at Truro and Picton in\r\nNova Scotia.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales arrived at Charlottetown on the morning of August\r\n9th and, despite pouring rain, was received by crowds in a tastefully\r\ndecorated city. He was formally welcomed by Lieutenant-Governor George\r\nDundas, Chief Justice Hodgson, Premier, the Hon. Charles Palmer, and all\r\nthe dignitaries and officials of the Island. As the procession passed to\r\nGovernment House 2000 children sang the National Anthem and the crowds\r\ncheered enthusiastically. A Levée was held on the following day, a\r\nreview of the volunteers proceeded with, and addresses received from the\r\nProvincial and Civic authorities. A ball at the Provincial Building\r\nconcluded the festivities and the Prince danced until three in the\r\nmorning. The Royal visitor then departed for the Upper Provinces and\r\narrived in Gaspé Bay, on August 12th, after seeing much that was\r\nbeautiful in the way of scenery. Here the Prince was formally welcomed\r\nto the Canada of that day by His Excellency Sir Edmund W. Head,\r\nGovernor-General of all British America, and by the Canadian Ministry,\r\nwhich included the Hon. John A. Macdonald, George E. Cartier, A. T.\r\nGalt, John Ross, N. F. Belleau, J. C. Morrison, L. S. Morin and others\r\nof historic name. A visit to the gloomy and splendid scenes along the\r\nSaguenay followed and on August 17th, after passing further up the St.\r\nLawrence, Quebec was reached by the Royal fleet. The succeeding day was\r\nmarked by His Royal Highness' first public entry into Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL WELCOME AT QUEBEC\r\n\r\nNo more splendid natural setting for a national event can be found in\r\nthe world than that afforded by the crowning heights, the broad sweep of\r\nriver, the ancient and towering fortress of Quebec. Upon this occasion\r\nthe old-fashioned French city, nestling upon the sides of the cliff, was\r\nvivid with flags and the narrow streets filled with arches, while crowds\r\nof interested people thronged every part of the place. The Heir to the\r\nThrone was formally received at the wharf by the Governor-General, who\r\nwas accompanied by the Canadian Ministry in their uniforms of blue and\r\ngold; Lord Lyons, the British Minister at Washington; Lieutenant-General\r\nSir W. Fenwick Williams, Commander of the Forces; Sir A. N. McNab, Sir\r\nE. P. Taché, Major H. L. Langevin and others prominent in the public\r\nlife of the Provinces. In a special Pavilion which had been erected, the\r\nPrince was presented by Major Langevin--better known to a subsequent\r\ngeneration as Sir Hector Langevin, M.P.--with an address describing the\r\nloyalty of the French population to British institutions and connection.\r\nIn his reply the Royal guest spoke of the differences of origin,\r\nlanguage and religion as being \"lost in one universal spirit of\r\npatriotism which had knit all classes to the Mother-land in common ties\r\nof equal liberty and free institutions.\" During the procession through\r\nthe city which followed there was much cheering, and in the evening,\r\ndespite the rain which had poured all day, the illuminations were\r\nexceedingly good.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the Anglican Cathedral was attended by His Royal\r\nHighness with the Governor-General and their suites. The succeeding day\r\nwas again stormy but a visit was paid to the Chaudière Falls and on\r\nTuesday a Levée was held at the old Parliament Buildings attended by the\r\nRoman Catholic Hierarchy of the Province of Quebec in a body, clad in\r\npurple robes, and followed in order by the Judges and members of the\r\nLegislative Council and Assembly of the United Provinces of Upper and\r\nLower Canada--as Ontario and Quebec were then generally called. An\r\naddress was presented on behalf of the Council by its Speaker, the Hon.\r\nN. F. Belleau and replied to by the Prince, after which he conferred the\r\nhonour of knighthood upon Mr. Belleau. An address was then presented on\r\nbehalf of the Assembly by its Speaker, the Hon. Henry Smith, who also\r\nreceived the distinction of being personally knighted by the Royal\r\nvisitor. Other addresses were presented and later in the day a visit was\r\npaid to the beautiful Falls of Montmorenci--the route to which was\r\nornamented with arches, flags and evergreens. In the evening a grand\r\nball was given and the Prince danced through almost the entire\r\nprogramme. On the following day a visit was paid to Laval University and\r\nan address received from the Roman Catholic Hierarchy at the hands of\r\nBishop Horan of Kingston, as well as one from the University. The former\r\ndocument stated that the Church was always careful to teach that Kings\r\nreign by God's will and that, therefore, \"entire submission is due to\r\nthe authority they have received from on high.\" They believed\r\n\"traditional respect for the high moral principle of legitimate\r\nauthority\" to be the real strength of Canadian society. The Prince\r\nresponded in fitting terms to both addresses. The Ursuline Convent was\r\nalso visited and an address received. In the evening a display of\r\nfireworks was given and on the morning of August 23rd His Royal Highness\r\ndeparted for Three Rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE AT MONTREAL\r\n\r\nThe trip up the River was a pleasant one and, after a brief stay at\r\nThree Rivers where the Mayor--Mr. J. E. Turcotte M.P.P.--presented an\r\naddress, the journey was resumed to Montreal. Accompanying the steamer\r\n_Kingston_ (which had been specially fitted up for this occasion) from\r\nThree Rivers was another containing the members of the Legislature. All\r\nalong the shores of the St. Lawrence were little crowds of _habitants_\r\nstriving for a glimpse of the Royal visitor and, when nearing Montreal,\r\nhe was received by a fleet of vessels crowded with cheering people. The\r\nreception in the city commenced on the morning of August 25th and was\r\nmarked by the gathering of numerous crowds and intense interest. An\r\naddress was presented by Mr. Charles S. Rodier, the Mayor of Montreal,\r\nin a handsome Pavilion specially erected for the purpose, and surrounded\r\nby the entire military and volunteer force of the district and city. The\r\nMayor in his scarlet robes, the Ministers in their new Windsor uniforms,\r\nthe officers in their varied military dress and Bishop Fulford and the\r\nAnglican clergy in their gowns, made quite a brilliant spectacle on the\r\ndais. After the Prince had replied to the address the Royal procession\r\npassed through the city to the Crystal Palace, the streets being gay\r\nwith flags, banners, evergreens, transparencies and eight, more or less,\r\nhandsome arches.\r\n\r\nAt the new building, or Crystal Palace, an Exhibition was duly opened by\r\nthe Prince, who then proceeded to the Victoria Bridge station where he\r\nwas met by the Hon. John Ross, President of the Grand Trunk Railway, and\r\nother officials. An address was presented descriptive of the great\r\nstructure across the St. Lawrence and, after his reply, the Prince was\r\ntaken from the station to the Bridge in a carriage lined with crimson\r\nvelvet and there proceeded to formally open it for public use. An\r\nelaborate luncheon, attended by 600 persons and presided over by Sir\r\nEdmund Head, followed. After receiving an address from the workmen\r\nemployed in the undertaking His Royal Highness returned to the city and\r\nin the evening witnessed illuminations which made Montreal a blaze of\r\nlight. On Sunday, the 26th, the Prince attended Christ Church Cathedral\r\nand heard a sermon from Bishop Fulford. During the succeeding day he\r\nwitnessed a lacrosse game by Indians, watched a procession of Temperance\r\norganizations, and held a Levée at the Court House where addresses were\r\npresented from the Church of England, McGill College, the inhabitants of\r\nRed River Colony--now the City of Winnipeg--and others.\r\n\r\nIn the evening one of the finest balls ever given on the Continent of\r\nAmerica was attended by the Prince. The decorations were gorgeous and\r\nyet tasteful and the Royal guest is stated to have danced incessantly\r\nuntil half-past four in the morning. On Tuesday he visited Dickenson's\r\nLanding in a special car built by the Grand Trunk Railway and from\r\nthence went down the Rapids of the St. Lawrence in the steamer\r\n_Kingston_. The evening saw a Grand Musical Festival in his honour and\r\non the following day a Royal review of 1600 troops took place. A visit\r\nfollowed to Sir George Simpson's residence at Isle Dorval, accompanied\r\nby a canoe excursion down the St. Lawrence under the auspices of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company, of which Sir G. Simpson had so long been head. The\r\nevening witnessed a torch-light procession of Montreal Firemen. On\r\nAugust 30th the Royal visitor, the Governor-General and their suites,\r\ntook a special train for St. Hyacinthe where the Prince was\r\nenthusiastically received and several addresses presented at the Roman\r\nCatholic College. At Sherbrooke, in the afternoon, flags were flying\r\neverywhere and arches had been erected on all the principal streets. An\r\naddress was read by the Mayor, Mr. J. G. Robertson--afterwards for many\r\nyears Treasurer of the Province. A visit was then paid to the residence\r\nof the Hon. A. T. Galt, Minister of Finance, and on the way thither His\r\nRoyal Highness was almost smothered in bouquets of flowers thrown at him\r\nby young women along the route. A Levée was held here and hundreds of\r\npeople presented. At Montreal in the evening, a great display of\r\nfireworks took place and on the following morning the Prince left the\r\ncity finally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING EDWARD AS PRINCE OF WALES\r\n  When visiting Canada in 1860]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VISIT OF KING EDWARD WHEN PRINCE OF WALES TO TORONTO IN\r\n1860]\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE CAPITAL OF THE UNITED PROVINCES\r\n\r\nAt every village and town and tiny settlement on the way to Ottawa\r\ncrowds turned out to welcome and cheer the passing visitor; while flags\r\nand arches and decorations indicated the pleasure of the people in more\r\npractical shape. Near the capital of the United Provinces of Upper and\r\nLower Canada--seven years hence to be the capital of the new\r\nDominion--the Prince of Wales was received by a fleet of steamers and\r\n1200 lumbermen and Indians in birch-bark canoes and was escorted into\r\nthe city in a most picturesque style. Mayor Workman presented an address\r\nand a procession through the capital followed. On September 1st the\r\ncorner stone of the splendid Parliament Buildings, which afterwards\r\ngraced the hills of the Chaudière, was laid by the Royal visitor amid\r\nscenes of considerable dignity and much enthusiasm. Amongst those\r\npresent were H. E. Sir Edmund Head, Lord Mulgrave, General Sir Fenwick\r\nWilliams, Hon. John A. Macdonald and the other members of the Ministry.\r\nIn the afternoon a state luncheon was given by the Government at which\r\nthe Governor-General presided and the toasts proposed were presented\r\nrespectively by His Excellency, Sir N. F. Belleau, Sir Henry Smith and\r\nthe Prince himself. A visit to the Chaudière Falls followed and the\r\nusual illuminations were given in the evening. On Sunday Christ Church\r\nCathedral was attended and early in the succeeding day the journey was\r\nresumed--Arnprior, Almonte and Brockville being visited and addresses\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nAt this point in the tour occurred an unfortunate misunderstanding with\r\nthe Orangemen of Kingston and Toronto. While in Montreal the Duke of\r\nNewcastle--who was practically in charge of the Prince's movements so\r\nfar as they affected state and public interests--heard that the members\r\nof the Loyal Orange Order proposed to erect arches along the route of\r\nthe Royal procession in Toronto and Kingston and to decorate them with\r\nOrange colours and regalia. The Duke at once wrote to Sir Edmund Head\r\nthat this would not do. \"It is obvious that a display of this nature on\r\nsuch an occasion is likely to lead to religious feud and breach of the\r\npeace; and it is my duty to prevent, so far as I am able, the exposure\r\nof the Prince to supposed participation in a scene so much to be\r\ndeprecated, and so alien to the spirit in which he visits Canada.\" He\r\nadded that if the policy was persisted in he would advise the Prince not\r\nto visit the places in question.\r\n\r\nSectarian feeling, it may be added, was very strong at this time in\r\nUpper Canada and the Catholics and Orangemen were drawn up in two\r\ndistinctly hostile camps of religious and political thought. This was\r\nespecially the case in Toronto and Kingston. The Governor-General at\r\nonce wrote the Mayors of these two towns under date of August 31st and,\r\nin the course of his letter said: \"You will bear in mind, Sir, that His\r\nRoyal Highness visits this Colony on the special invitation of the whole\r\npeople, as conveyed by both branches of the Legislature, without\r\ndistinction of creed or party; and it would be inconsistent with the\r\nspirit and object of such an invitation, and such a visit, to thrust on\r\nhim the exhibition of banners or other badges of distinction which are\r\nknown to be offensive to any of Her Majesty's subjects.\" Roman Catholics\r\ncalled meetings to protest at the intended action of the Orangemen; the\r\nlatter met in public and private and convinced themselves that the\r\nrepresentatives of the former were being allowed to control the Prince's\r\nmovements. They pointed to their own well-known loyalty to the Crown and\r\nBritish institutions and to the fact that Roman Catholics had been\r\npermitted every privilege in welcoming the Prince in Lower Canada.\r\nEventually, although the Duke of Newcastle made every effort to smooth\r\nmatters over, the City Council of Kingston and the Orangemen of that\r\nplace refused to give way and the steamer _Kingston_, after sixteen\r\nhours had been given for consideration, passed in her course to\r\nBelleville without the Prince landing in the gaily decorated and\r\nhistoric town.\r\n\r\nWriting from the steamer on September 5th, before leaving for the next\r\ndestination in the Royal tour, the Duke wrote to the Mayor a long letter\r\nin which the following sentence occurs: \"What is the sacrifice I asked\r\nthe Orangemen to make? Merely to abstain from displaying in the presence\r\nof a young Prince of 19 years of age--the heir to a sceptre which rules\r\nover millions of every form of Christianity--symbols of religious and\r\npolitical organization which are notoriously offensive to the members of\r\nanother creed!\" He expressed regret that the City Council had not\r\naccepted the suggestion to present their address on board the steamer as\r\nhad been done by the Church of Scotland Synod. The reply of the Mayor,\r\nMr. O. S. Strange, disclaimed sympathy with the Orangemen while\r\ndefending a refusal to approve the advice given to the Prince of Wales.\r\nIt also pointed out that the garbs and flags of the Orange Order were no\r\nmore compromising to the Royal visitor than were the robes and insignia\r\nof the Catholic Hierarchy of Quebec during the reception in that\r\nProvince.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL RECEPTION AT TORONTO\r\n\r\nBelleville was reached on September 5th, but no landing was effected on\r\naccount of Orange troubles of the same kind as at Kingston. The\r\ndisappointment of the people was extreme, as the preparations had been\r\nelaborate and the decorations costly. Visits followed to Cobourg, where\r\na ball was given; to Rice Lake, where an address was received from the\r\nMississaga Indians; to Peterborough, Whitby and Port Hope, which were\r\nmost lavishly decorated. Toronto was reached on September 7th and the\r\ngreatest reception of the tour given to the Royal visitor. As the centre\r\nof Orange sentiment in Upper Canada some difficulty was feared, and as a\r\nmatter of fact there was a misunderstanding between the Duke of\r\nNewcastle and Mayor Wilson--afterwards Sir Adam Wilson, Chief Justice of\r\nOntario--regarding the Orange arch; but this was ultimately smoothed\r\nover. The city was gay with flags and decorations; nine arches had been\r\nerected in the principal streets; a large amphitheatre was built for the\r\npurposes of the formal reception; and the city was crowded with people.\r\nAt the amphitheatre an address was received from the city and replied to\r\nby the Prince in a speech in which he referred to the generous loyalty\r\nof his welcome as the Queen's representative--\"a loyalty tempered and\r\nyet strengthened by the intelligent independence of the Canadian\r\ncharacter.\" A welcome was sung by 5000 school children and a procession\r\nthrough Toronto followed. Brilliant illuminations in the evening made\r\nthe town bright and in the ensuing morning the Prince held a Levée at\r\nwhich one thousand gentlemen were presented.\r\n\r\nAddresses were presented during this function from the Upper Canada\r\nBible Society, the Church of England Synod Trinity University, the\r\nPresbyterian Synod, the St. George's Society, the Temperance\r\norganizations, the County Council of York, and Knox College, and were\r\nduly replied to. In the afternoon His Royal Highness attended a\r\nreception given by the Law Society and in the evening a dance under the\r\nsame auspices at Osgoode Hall. On the next day, Sunday, the Prince\r\nattended service at St. James Cathedral and listened to a sermon from\r\nBishop Strachan. On Monday, an excursion was made to Collingwood, on the\r\nGeorgian Bay, and the Prince was accompanied by the Governor-General,\r\nSir Fenwick Williams and the Hon. Messrs. A. T. Galt, P. M. Vankoughnet,\r\nW. B. Robinson, J. Hillyard Cameron and others, as well as by his suite.\r\nAt Newmarket, Aurora, Bradford and Barrie addresses were received and at\r\nevery point along the Northern Railway there were decorations and crowds\r\nof people.\r\n\r\nAt Collingwood there was luncheon and an enthusiastic reception and the\r\nPrince then returned to Toronto, where he watched the games of the\r\nCanadian Highland Society for a time. September 11th was a very wet day,\r\nbut the Royal visitor attended a Regatta held under the auspices of the\r\nRoyal Canadian Yacht Club, opened Queen's Park, and laid a pedestal for\r\na statue to the Queen. He also reviewed the Toronto Volunteer Corps, and\r\nvisited the University of Toronto where he received an address as well\r\nas one from Upper Canada College. A visit to the Educational Department\r\nof the Province and Knox College followed and a busy day was concluded\r\nby a great ball in the evening, at which the Prince danced until four in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE IN THE WEST\r\n\r\nOn September 12th His Royal Highness left Toronto for a trip through the\r\nwestern portion of Upper Canada (Ontario) and was welcomed at every\r\nstation by decorations and cheering crowds. Arches were everywhere and\r\nsalutes were fired with frequency. A short stop was made at Guelph and\r\nStratford and an address was received at the German settlement of\r\nPeterburg, to which the Prince replied in the same language. In the\r\nafternoon London was reached and an enthusiastic reception given which\r\nincluded a torchlight procession and evening illuminations. Sarnia was\r\nvisited on the following day and, besides the usual addresses, one was\r\npresented from the Indians of Upper Canada. At London, in the evening, a\r\nball was given and the young Prince danced with the animation which he\r\nhad displayed at all the entertainments of this character given in his\r\nhonour. On September 14th he proceeded to visit Niagara Falls in a new\r\nand beautiful car specially constructed by the Great Western Railway\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nWoodstock, Paris, Brantford, Dunnville and Port Colborne were visited\r\n_en route_, and at the Falls in the evening most exquisite illuminations\r\nwere exhibited for the pleasure of the visitor--lines of fire running\r\nalong the cliffs while other kinds of light intensified the natural\r\nsplendour of the scene. During his several days at this point, the\r\nPrince saw Blondin cross the chasm on a rope; attended service at the\r\nlittle church in the Canadian village; paid a brief visit to the\r\nAmerican fort on the other side of Niagara River; saw the Welland Canal\r\nand visited Queenston Heights and the tomb of Sir Isaac Brock. At the\r\nlatter place he received an address from one hundred and sixty survivors\r\nof the War of 1812 at the hands of Chief Justice Sir J. Beverley\r\nRobinson and, on September 18th, laid the corner-stone of an obelisk in\r\nhonour of the chief Canadian hero of that contest. A visit to Port\r\nDalhousie and Hamilton followed, and at the latter place the reception\r\nwas marked by splendid decorations and much enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIn his reply to the address the Royal visitor was more than usually\r\nimpressive--no doubt realizing that the end of this visit to a great\r\ncountry of the future was close at hand. \"I can never forget,\" he said,\r\n\"the scenes I have witnessed during the short time in which I have\r\nenjoyed the privilege of associating myself with the Canadian people,\r\nwhich must ever be a bright epoch in my life. I shall bear away with me\r\na grateful remembrance of kindness and affection which, as yet, I have\r\nbeen unable to do anything to merit; and it shall be the constant effort\r\nof my future years to prove myself not unworthy of the love and\r\nconfidence of a generous people.\" Fire-works, a state concert, a visit\r\nto the Central School, a luncheon at the Royal Hotel, a visit to the\r\nwaterworks and a grand ball in the evening were amongst the events of\r\nthe stay in Hamilton. On September 20th the last address received and\r\nanswered by His Royal Highness in Canada was presented by the\r\nAgricultural Society of Upper Canada. To its loyal phrases the King and\r\nEmperor of a distant future made this final response: \"My duties as\r\nrepresentative of the Queen, deputed by her to visit British North\r\nAmerica, cease this day; but in a private capacity I am about to visit,\r\nbefore I return home, that remarkable land which claims with us a common\r\nancestry and in whose extraordinary progress every Englishman feels a\r\ncommon interest. Before I quit British soil let me once more address\r\nthrough you the inhabitants of United Canada and bid them an\r\naffectionate farewell. May God pour down his choicest blessings upon\r\nthis great and loyal people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE OF WALES IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nWindsor was reached in the evening and after words of loyal greeting had\r\nbeen received from its people, the Prince of Wales left Canadian soil\r\nand, accompanied by the Governor of Michigan and the Mayor of Detroit,\r\ncrossed the river to United States territory and was welcomed there as\r\nLord Renfrew--one of his many minor titles. This part of the Royal tour\r\nhad been arranged as a result of an invitation received by the Queen\r\nfrom President Buchanan dated June 4th, 1860, and expressing the hope\r\nthat His Royal Highness' visit would be extended to the Republic. This\r\nhad been agreed to by the Queen who intimated in reply that, while in\r\nthe United States, the Prince would drop all Royal state and travel\r\nunder the name of Lord Renfrew as he was accustomed to do on the\r\nContinent of Europe. It may be said, in passing, that this _incognito_\r\nwas very slightly observed and that the Royal visitor was welcomed\r\neverywhere as the heir to the British throne and the son of a\r\nmuch-respected and friendly Sovereign.\r\n\r\nAt Detroit the Prince parted from the Governor-General of Canada and the\r\nmembers of the Canadian Government who had hitherto accompanied him and,\r\nafter a drive around the city and a brilliant illumination in the\r\nevening, departed on the morning of September 21st for Chicago. A\r\nspecial car was provided by the Michigan Central Railway. At Chicago\r\nthere was no formal welcome or function; no particular enthusiasm or\r\ncrowds. The Prince was driven around the great new city of the West and\r\nenjoyed his first experience of the panorama of American development\r\nwhich that centre even then presented. He did not stay long and on the\r\n22nd departed for Dwight, in the same State, where four days were spent\r\nin shooting. On September 27th he arrived at St. Louis, then a place of\r\nabout seventeen thousand people, and here His Royal Highness visited the\r\nState Fair. There were estimated to have been twenty-eight thousand\r\npersons in the amphitheatre of the Fair and a curious incident of the\r\nvisit is recorded by a writer, already quoted, who states that a vain\r\nsearch of the city had been made for a Union Jack to place beside the\r\nAmerican flag on the central building.\r\n\r\nFrom St. Louis the Prince proceeded to Cincinnati, in Ohio, and on the\r\nevening of September 29th attended a ball given by an enterprising\r\ncitizen who had just erected a handsome new theatre. On Sunday, St.\r\nJohn's Church was visited and a sermon preached by Bishop McIlvaine.\r\nPittsburg was reached on October 1st and an enthusiastic but informal\r\nreception accorded. Harrisburg was the next place visited and it was\r\nnoted that, as the Prince and his suite went further east and south, the\r\ncurious crowds gave place to increasingly enthusiastic crowds. At\r\nBaltimore immense throngs of people had gathered and thence on October\r\n3rd the Royal party proceeded to Washington which they reached in the\r\nafternoon. The Prince, who had been accompanied through American\r\nterritory by Lord Lyons, the British Minister, was welcomed to the\r\ncapital by General Cass and then driven to the White House where, in the\r\nevening, a state reception was given in his honour.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the President held a Levée, accompanied by \"Lord\r\nRenfrew,\" and a great number of people attended. Afterwards a visit was\r\npaid to the handsome public buildings of the city. On October 5th,\r\nPresident Buchanan, his niece, Miss Harriet Lane, the Prince of Wales\r\nand many members of the American Cabinet and Diplomatic Corps, as well\r\nas the Duke of Newcastle and Lord Lyons, visited Mount Vernon. There,\r\nfor a few moments, the descendant of George III. stood with uncovered\r\nhead before the tomb of George Washington. In the evening a state dinner\r\nwas given by Lord Lyons and on the following day the Prince left\r\nWashington for Richmond. Here his most enjoyable experience is said to\r\nhave been, not the historical explanations and hospitable companionship\r\nof Governor Letcher, but the first taste of a mint julep mixed by a\r\nnegro of much local fame in the preparation of this cooling drink.\r\nBaltimore was visited on October 8th and Philadelphia on the 10th. At\r\nsome of these centres of population the Prince was able to spend a part\r\nof the day, incognito, amongst the people who, in perfect ignorance of\r\nhis presence, no doubt taught the future King of Great Britain much that\r\nhe would never otherwise have known as to public opinion in a country\r\nwhere the courses of freedom were uncontrolled by custom and unshackled\r\nby precedent or tradition. A feature of the visit to Philadelphia was a\r\nsplendid concert given in the Opera House, at which Patti and others\r\nsang to a brilliant audience amidst striking decorations. To the verses\r\nof \"God Save the Queen\" were added the following lines:\r\n\r\n    \"Long may the Prince abide,\r\n    England's hope, joy and pride,\r\n      Long live the Prince;\r\n    May England's future King,\r\n    Victoria's virtues bring,\r\n    To grace his reign.\r\n      God save the Prince.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 11th the Prince of Wales arrived in New York and was welcomed\r\non his steamer by General Winfield Scott and a reception committee. At\r\nthe landing place Mayor Fernando Wood received him with the simple\r\nwords: \"As Chief Magistrate of this city, I welcome you here and believe\r\nthat I represent the entire population without exception.\" The guest's\r\nreply was equally brief and then, clad in a Colonel's uniform, the\r\nPrince was driven through crowded streets to the City Hall, where six\r\nthousand soldiers were reviewed, and thence to the Fifth Avenue Hotel.\r\nThe only unpleasant incident of the visit was the refusal of an Irish\r\nregiment to turn out upon this occasion with the other troops. During\r\nthe following day His Royal Highness visited the University of New York,\r\nthe Astor Library and the Cooper Institute. At the first-named\r\ninstitution he listened to an address on the electric telegraph from\r\nProfessor Morse. In the evening a splendid ball was given at the Academy\r\nof Music where brilliant decorations vied with the beautiful costumes.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the Prince, with his suite, visited Brady's\r\nphotograph gallery and Barnum's Museum and, in the evening, witnessed a\r\ntorch-light procession of five thousand Firemen. At the first-named\r\nplace he inspected and asked for portraits of the eminent men of the\r\nUnited States and especially inquired for one of Secretary W. L. Marcy.\r\nTrinity Church was attended on Sunday and a sermon heard from the Rev.\r\nDr. Francis Vinton--assisted in the service by a number of other\r\nclergymen. The church was crowded and ten thousand people waited outside\r\nto see the Royal visitor. New York was left on the following morning and\r\nWest Point and Albany visited. In the afternoon of October 17th the\r\nPrince and his suite arrived at Boston and were formally welcomed by the\r\nGovernor of Massachusetts as representing a country with which the\r\nAmerican people were, he declared, united by \"many ties of language, law\r\nand liberty.\" At luncheon the Hon. Edward Everett was one of the guests\r\nas the Hon. W. H. Seward had been at a dinner in Albany. In the\r\nafternoon a children's concert was given at the Music Hall in honour of\r\nthe Prince and an Ode written by Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes was sung with\r\nenthusiasm to the air of the British National anthem. It commenced with\r\nthe following verse:\r\n\r\n    \"God bless our fathers' Land,\r\n    Keep her in heart and hand,\r\n      One with our own.\r\n    From all her foes defend,\r\n    Be her brave people's friend,\r\n    On all her realms descend\r\n      Protect her throne!\"\r\n\r\nA ball was given in the evening at the Boston Theatre and, on the\r\nfollowing morning, a flying visit paid to Cambridge and to Harvard\r\nUniversity. Incidentally, it may be added, the Prince met Longfellow,\r\nEmerson, Holmes and others during his stay in Boston. On October 20th he\r\nreached Portland and, amid roaring cannon, ringing bells and crowds of\r\ncheering people passed from the shores of America to his ship in the\r\nranks of a British squadron and thence home to the British Isles. On\r\nNovember 15th, His Royal Highness arrived at Plymouth and shortly\r\nafterwards the Duke of Newcastle received the Order of the Garter from\r\nthe Queen as a token of her appreciation of his conduct during the Royal\r\ntour. Under date of December 8th Her Majesty communicated to the\r\nAmerican President, through Lord Lyons, her great satisfaction at \"the\r\nfeeling of confidence and affection\" which had been shown upon this\r\noccasion by the people of the United States towards herself and her\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSpeaking on the same date at Nottingham, England, the Duke of Newcastle\r\nstated that during his recent visit to British North America he had\r\n\"witnessed such devotion to the Sovereign and these realms as no one who\r\nhad not witnessed it himself would be willing to believe. It was a\r\ndemonstration of the attachment of the entire people to the throne of\r\nEngland and of their veneration for the lady who at present occupied it.\r\nIt was a loyalty not of creed, nor of party, nor of race.\" As to the\r\nUnited States the influence of the Queen's personality had been even\r\nmore striking. The reception of the Prince there had been an\r\nextraordinary one. \"With one solitary exception they met with nothing\r\nbut enthusiasm and, in fact, he did believe that the visit of the Prince\r\nof Wales to America had done more to cement the good feeling between the\r\ntwo countries than could possibly have been affected by a quarter of a\r\ncentury of diplomacy.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] Robert Cellem in _Visit of the Prince of Wales_ to Toronto, Canada,\r\n1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Marriage\r\n\r\n\r\nThree years after the birth of the Heir to the British Throne, in one of\r\nthe historic palaces of his family and country, there was born on\r\nDecember 1st, 1844, in a comparatively humble home at Copenhagen, the\r\nPrincess Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louisa Julia of Denmark. The\r\nhouse was called a palace, her father was Heir to the Throne of Denmark,\r\nand became King Christian IX. on November 15th, 1863, but the mansion\r\nwas, none the less, a quiet and unostentatious place, and the Prince a\r\npersonage with hardly more resources or a larger revenue than many an\r\nEnglish country gentleman.\r\n\r\nSimplicity and domesticity were the guiding principles of the Princess\r\nAlexandra's education and training. Her mother, the late Queen Louise of\r\nDenmark, was beautiful, graceful and clever, and seems to have possessed\r\nthat love of home which is more rare than even the striking combination\r\nof qualities just mentioned. She was passionately fond of music, while\r\nPrince Christian was fond of drawing, and these subjects, together with\r\nlanguages and needle-work and all the essentials of the most simple home\r\nwork and management, were taught to the girls who were respectively to\r\nbecome Empress of Russia, Queen of Great Britain, and Duchess of\r\nCumberland in after years.\r\n\r\nAs the years passed on the Princess Alexandra became probably the most\r\nbeautiful girl in the Courts of Europe, and one of the least known\r\noutside a limited family circle. When hardly seventeen, and at a period\r\nin which the marriage of the young Prince of Wales was being seriously\r\nthought of by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, he chanced to see a\r\nportrait of the Princess. There seems to be no doubt that it was purely\r\nby accident--unless the wise and far-seeing Prince Consort indirectly\r\ncontrolled the incident--and that the picture of the lovely young girl,\r\nsmiling from out of simple surroundings and a simple costume, had an\r\nimmediate effect. He kept the photograph, and a little later saw a\r\nminiature of the Princess at the home of a friend. In a surprisingly\r\nshort time the Prince had heard that the original of the picture was\r\n\"the most beautiful girl in Europe,\" and was on his way to Prussia to\r\nattend the military manoeuvres of the season. The Crown Prince and\r\nPrincess of Denmark happened to be travelling in the vicinity at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE MEETS PRINCESS ALEXANDRA\r\n\r\nOn September 24th, 1861, the Prince of Wales and his party met the\r\nDanish Royal party in the Cathedral of Worms, and the former had a first\r\nglance at his future wife. Then followed a few days at the Castle of\r\nHeidelberg, where they were all guests together, and about which a note\r\nin Prince Albert's _Diary_ of September 30th says that \"the young people\r\nseem to have taken a warm liking for each other.\" Less than three months\r\nafter this entry the writer had passed away, but the sad event only made\r\nthe widowed Queen more anxious for her son's marriage. Further meetings\r\noccurred at the Princess Frederick's--the English Crown Princess--and\r\nelsewhere, and on September 9th, 1862, the betrothal took place;\r\nalthough it was not publicly announced until November 8th. The Prince\r\nwas then just twenty-one and the Princess not yet eighteen, and it was\r\nunderstood that some months would elapse before the marriage. Meanwhile,\r\nin August, Queen Victoria had first met and been charmed by her future\r\ndaughter-in-law at the Laacken Palace of the King of the Belgians. The\r\nDanish people were naturally delighted at the news, and, poor as they\r\nwere in a national sense, they at once subscribed a total sum of £8,000\r\nto constitute what was called the People's Dowry. This the Princess\r\naccepted with cordial thanks to the nation, but asked that a substantial\r\nportion of it be allotted to provide a dowry for six poor girls whose\r\nweddings should take place on the same day as her own.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF THE PRINCESS\r\n\r\nMeantime the English people were expressing their pleasure at the news\r\nin various ways. The House of Commons voted the Prince of Wales a yearly\r\nincome of £40,000 and his bride-to-be £10,000 for herself. Including the\r\n£40,000 from the Duchy of Cornwall this made a reasonable sum, while\r\nSandringham and Marlborough House were allotted as Royal\r\nresidences--requiring, however, much remodelling and improvement.\r\nPreparations of the most elaborate and splendid sort were made to\r\nwelcome the lovely Danish Princess and into these arrangements the whole\r\npeople seemed to throw themselves with mingled excitement and pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn the little Copenhagen palace this turmoil was hardly known; the\r\npreparations certainly were not comprehended; and the quiet family were\r\npreparing in the most simple way for the great occasion--not the least\r\nexcitement of the moment being the fact of their all going to England\r\ntogether. The wedding day was fixed for the 10th of March, and a few\r\ndays before this the Princess left Denmark for her new home; passing\r\nover carpets of flowers strewn in her way by pressing and cheering\r\ncrowds of affectionate people; receiving addresses everywhere, and\r\nsmiles and tears and good wishes from simple peasants, who had decorated\r\neven their hedgerows and who made the departure look like a triumphal\r\nprocession. Then King Frederick VII., presented her with a necklace of\r\ndiamonds and a facsimile of the Dagmar Cross--that precious relic of\r\nearly days and of the first Christian Queen of Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe Princess arrived in the Thames on board the _Victoria and\r\nAlbert_--which had been escorted from Flushing by a squadron of\r\nwar-ships--on the morning of March 1st, and was welcomed at Gravesend by\r\nan outburst of enthusiasm which literally astounded her. A stately and\r\nformal reception she had, of course, anticipated but the splendour of\r\nwhat actually appeared, the elaborate character of the preparations, the\r\nsurprising interest shewn by the people, were indeed revelations of the\r\nchanged conditions into which the bride of the Heir Apparent had come.\r\nAt Gravesend the dense crowds which lined the shores, or at least some\r\nportion of them, saw a sight which has been well described as pretty--\"A\r\ntimid girlish figure, dressed entirely in white, who appeared on the\r\ndeck at her mother's side and then retiring to the cabin, was seen first\r\nat one window then at another, the bewildering face framed in a little\r\nwhite bonnet; the work of her own hands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHER RECEPTION IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nWhen the Prince's yacht approached and he was seen to rush across the\r\ngangway, catch his bride in his arms and kiss her, the delight of the\r\nonlookers was unconstrained. As the Royal couple landed, girls strewed\r\nflowers under their feet. Then followed the glittering procession from\r\nGravesend to London and thence to Windsor through long lines of\r\ndecorated houses, garlanded and festooned roadways, flashing sabres and\r\ngorgeous uniformed soldiers. In London the streets were packed with\r\npeople; triumphal arches, banners and devices were everywhere. In the\r\npoorer streets, in the homes of the artisan and the factory girl, there\r\nwas the same effort to show pleasure in the happiness of the Princess\r\nand appreciation of her grace and beauty as there was in the great\r\nresidential squares. At Eton there was a triumphal arch and a loyal\r\ngathering of enthusiastic boys; at Windsor the Queen received the\r\nPrincess and conducted her to the suite of rooms which had been lately\r\noccupied by the Princess Alice. The first part, the popular reception,\r\nwas over and it had proved how accurately the Poet Laureate had grasped\r\nthe situation when he wrote of \"the sea-king's daughter from over the\r\nsea\" and gave that lordly command to the nation:\r\n\r\n    \"Welcome her; thunders of fort and of fleet!\r\n    Welcome her; thundering cheer of the street!\r\n    Welcome her; all things youthful and sweet!\r\n    Scatter the blossoms under her feet.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN VICTORIA, 1901\r\n  The Honored Mother of Edward VII]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.

They include the ancient and modern Crowns]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CORONATION OF EDWARD VII\r\n  King Edward received his crown at the hands of the venerable\r\n  Archbishop of Canterbury, at Westminster Abbey, on August 9,\r\n  1902, in the presence of representative peers and commoners of\r\n  the Empire]\r\n\r\n\r\nCELEBRATION OF THE MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nThe marriage was celebrated in St. George's Chapel, Windsor, on March\r\n10th, the ceremony being performed by Dr. Longley, Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, assisted by the Bishops of London, Winchester and Chester\r\nand by Dean Wellesley of Windsor. The Queen, owing to the Prince\r\nConsort's recent death, took no part officially but looked on from the\r\nRoyal closet. The historic Chapel was a blaze of colour and jewels and\r\nthe wedding guests numbered nine hundred of the highest rank and station\r\nand reputation in the land. Mr. Speaker Denison, afterwards Lord\r\nOssington, in his _Diary_ gives a description of the scene. \"It was a\r\nvery magnificent sight--rich, gorgeous and imposing. Beautiful women\r\nwere arrayed in the richest attire, in bright colours, blue, purple,\r\nred, and were covered with diamonds and jewels. Grandmothers looked\r\nbeautiful: Lady Abercorn, Lady Westminster, Lady Shaftsbury. Among the\r\nyoung, Lady Spencer, Lady Castlereagh, Lady Carmarthen, were bright and\r\nbrilliant. The Knights of the Garter in their robes looked each of them\r\na fine picture. As each of the Royal persons, with their attendants,\r\nwalked up the Chapel, at a certain point each stopped and made an\r\nobeisance to the Queen--the Princess Mary, the Duchess of Cambridge, the\r\nPrincess of Prussia, the Princess Alice of Hesse, the Princess Helena,\r\nthe Princess Christian, etc., each in turn formed a complete scene. The\r\nPrincess Alexandra, with her bridesmaids, made the best and most\r\nbeautiful scene. The Princess looked beautiful and very graceful in her\r\nmanner and demeanour.\" The bridesmaids were eight in number--Lady\r\nVictoria Scott, Lady Victoria Howard, Lady Agneta Yorke, Lady Feodora\r\nWellesley, Lady Diana Beauclerk, Lady Georgina Hamilton, Lady Alma\r\nBruce, and Lady Helena Hare. They represented many of the noblest houses\r\nin England and wore dresses described as being of \"white tulle over\r\nwhite glacé silk\" and trimmed with roses, shamrocks and white heather.\r\nEach of them also wore a locket presented by the Prince of Wales and\r\ncomposed of coral and diamonds so as to represent the red and white\r\nnational colours of Denmark. It is interesting to note that, in 1898,\r\nall these ladies were still living.\r\n\r\nDuring the ceremony, the Prince of Wales was supported by his uncle, the\r\nDuke of Saxe-Coburg, and his brother-in-law, the Crown Prince of\r\nPrussia. He wore the uniform of a British General, the Collar of the\r\nGarter, the Order of the Star of India and the rich, flowing purple\r\nvelvet mantle of a Knight of the Garter. Princess Alexandra was given\r\naway by her father and wore a white satin skirt trimmed with garlands of\r\norange blossoms and puffings of tulle and Honiton lace, the bodice being\r\ndraped with the same lace, while the train of silver moire antique was\r\ncovered with orange blossoms and puffings of tulle. She wore also the\r\ndiamond and pearl necklace, earings and brooch, given her by the\r\nbridegroom and the _rivière_ of diamonds presented by the Corporation of\r\nLondon, as well as three bracelets given, respectively, by the Queen,\r\nthe ladies of Leeds and the ladies of Manchester. Her beautiful hair was\r\nvery simply dressed and on it lay a wreath of orange blossoms covered\r\nby a veil of Honiton lace. The bridal bouquet was composed of orange\r\nblossoms, white rosebuds, orchids and sprigs of myrtle. The actual\r\nceremony was a very short one, the Prince giving his responses clearly,\r\nthough the Princess was at times almost inaudible. The whole function\r\nhad been a brilliant one--the first marriage celebrated in this Chapel\r\nsince that of Henry I. in 1122--and no touch of mourning was allowed to\r\nmar the pageantry of the scene and the bright colours of uniforms and\r\ndresses.\r\n\r\nThe wedding breakfast was held in the State dining-room and in St.\r\nGeorge's Hall and, while it was proceeding, the King of Denmark was\r\nlavishly entertaining both rich and poor in the home country of the\r\nRoyal bride. Throughout Great Britain that night bon-fires blazed, bells\r\nrang, houses were illuminated, balls and festivities were held, school\r\nchildren treated and banquets spread. Edinburgh excelled itself and some\r\none has said that a pen of fire dipped in rainbow hues would have been\r\nneeded to describe its pyrotechnic display. Meanwhile, the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales had taken their departure for Osborne, which had been\r\nlent them by the Queen, and there the brief honeymoon was spent. At\r\nReading, on the way thither, thirty thousand people met the train and\r\npresented the Princess with a bouquet. Writing of this most popular of\r\nhistoric weddings Canon Kingsley said in a private letter, dated March\r\n12th, that \"one real thing I did see, and felt too, the serious grace\r\nand reverent dignity of my dear young Master, whose manner was perfect.\r\nAnd one other real thing--the Queen's sad face. I cannot tell you how\r\nauspicious I consider this event or how happy it has made the little\r\nknot of us (the Prince's Household in which he had recently become a\r\nChaplain) who love him because we know him. I hear nothing but golden\r\nreports of the Princess from those who have known her long.\" A few days\r\nlater, on March 25th, Lady Waterford wrote to a friend that she had just\r\nseen at a reception \"the graceful, charming young Princess of Wales\"\r\nand that she had been in no way disappointed as to the beauty of which\r\nall England was talking. \"There was something charming in that very\r\nyoung pair walking up the room together. Her graceful bows and carriage\r\nyou will delight in and she has--with lovely youth and well-formed\r\nfeatures--a look of great intelligence beyond that of a mere girl. She\r\nwore the coronet of diamonds and a very long train of cloth of silver\r\ntrimmed with lace, pearl and diamond necklace, bracelet and a stomacher\r\nand two love-locks of rich brown hair floated on her shoulders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY HOME LIFE OF THE ROYAL COUPLE\r\n\r\nThe Royal pair did not stay very long on the Isle of Wight and, after a\r\nvisit to Buckingham Palace and Windsor, entered their new home at\r\nSandringham on March 28th. Here the beautiful personality and character\r\nof the Princess soon impressed themselves upon the life of the house and\r\nits more public environment. She proved to be a model housewife, later\r\non a model mother, and always and everywhere a model of tactful action\r\nand conversation. Pliability and adaptability were useful and important\r\nqualities which she found more than serviceable in these early years of\r\nher transition from a comparatively humble home to one of continuous\r\nsplendour and almost constant state. Difficulties there naturally were\r\nof many minor sorts and formidable they no doubt were in the sum total.\r\nNew customs to comprehend and adopt; new intricacies of a not entirely\r\nfamiliar language to become acquainted with; new and varied\r\nresponsibilities in both domestic and public life to understand and put\r\nin practice; qualities of natural diffidence and reserve to overcome.\r\nBut these and other obstacles were conquered with an apparent ease which\r\nconcealed any real trouble in the struggle, and the Princess threw\r\nherself into the life and work of her husband and the spirit of the\r\nEnglish people in a way which has ever since ensured to her the lasting\r\nlove of those in her immediate circle and the deep-seated affection of\r\nthe many-sided British public.\r\n\r\nDuring the three or four immediately following years the public\r\nappearances of the Prince and Princess of Wales were not numerous.\r\nPhilanthropic interests were taken up and maintained, but domestic and\r\nhome interests seemed to hold the first place. In August, 1864, a visit\r\nwas paid to the Highlands and some weeks spent at Abergeldie. Here, Dr.\r\nNorman Macleod was amongst their guests and here they saw much of the\r\nEarl and Countess of Fife, parents of their future son-in-law, the\r\npresent Duke of Fife. An autumn visit to Denmark followed and the Prince\r\nfor the first time saw his wife's early home. A good deal of shooting\r\nwas indulged in at and around Bernsdorff and from Elsinore, after a few\r\nweeks, the Royal couple went in their yacht to Stockholm on a visit to\r\nthe King and Queen of Sweden. The infant, Prince Albert Victor, had been\r\nwith them up to this time but he was now sent home in charge of the\r\nCountess de Grey and the Prince and Princess returned by way of Germany\r\nand Belgium. A short stay was made with the Prince and Princess Louis of\r\nHesse at Darmstadt and another at Brussels. Sandringham was reached in\r\ntime to celebrate the twentieth birthday of the Princess.\r\n\r\nAn incident of this year was the personal subscription of £10,000 by the\r\nPrince of Wales toward the erection of the Frogmore Mausoleum in honour\r\nof his father and, it may be added, a very marked and significant\r\nfeature of all his speeches during these years was deep respect and\r\nadmiration for the Prince Consort's life and memory. In 1865 the Prince\r\nmade his first State visit to Ireland and on May 9th opened the\r\nInternational Exhibition at Dublin. The weather was beautiful, the loyal\r\ndemonstrations in the streets were most enthusiastic, the great hall\r\nwhere the ceremony took place was decorated with the flags of the\r\nnations and filled with the most distinguished gathering which Ireland\r\ncould produce. The Duke of Leinster, the Earl of Rosse, and all the\r\nleading noblemen of the country were there, as well as the Lord Mayor\r\nand Corporation of Dublin in their civic robes, the Mayors of Cork and\r\nWaterford and Londonderry, the Lord Mayors of London and York and the\r\nLord Provost of Edinburgh. When His Royal Highness took his place in the\r\nChair of State an orchestra of one thousand voices performed the\r\nNational Anthem and ten thousand other voices joined in song. After the\r\nceremony, during which the Prince made two brief speeches, he attended\r\nin the evening a ball at the Mansion House given by the Lord Mayor.\r\nMeanwhile the city was brilliantly illuminated. In the morning he\r\nreviewed a number of troops in Phoenix Park and was received with much\r\nenthusiasm by the enormous crowds gathered around the scene.\r\n\r\nA little later, on May 19th, the Prince attended the opening of an\r\nInternational Reformatory Exhibition at Islington and received and\r\nanswered an address from its President, Lord Shaftesbury. Three days\r\nafterwards he opened the Sailors' Home in the East End of London and was\r\ngreeted by great crowds of cheering people. On June 5th, he marked his\r\nliking for the Drama by inaugurating the Royal Dramatic College at\r\nWoking and six days later received a banquet at the hands of the\r\nFishmongers' Company in London. On July 3rd he was distributing prizes\r\nat Wellington College attended by the Bishop of Oxford, the Earl of\r\nDerby, Earl Stanhope, Lord Eversley and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nEarly Home Life and Varied Duties\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the years immediately succeeding his marriage the career of the\r\nPrince of Wales was one of initiation into the responsibilities of home\r\nlife and the duties of public life. It was a period of moulding\r\ninfluences and a round of functions--some perfunctory, some pleasant. It\r\nwas a time of trial for a very young man placed in a very high position,\r\nand with temptations which might easily have led him into temporary and\r\neven permanent forgetfulness of the responsibilities of the future.\r\nSeveral causes, apart from his own natural strength of character,\r\ncombined to avert such a result. The sympathetic and gracious character\r\nof his wife and the perfection of management and detail which she\r\nintroduced into the home life of Sandringham and the more public and\r\nsocial life of Marlborough House, were factors of importance. The\r\nrecollection of his father's teachings and high ideals and the knowledge\r\nof his Royal mother's character and devotion to principle were important\r\ninfluences. The growth of family ties had its effect, and, finally, the\r\nshock of a sickness in 1871, which brought him to the verge of death and\r\nshowed him the loving affection of the nation, completed the process of\r\neducation in that difficult and dangerous road which the youthful Heir\r\nto a great Throne must always travel.\r\n\r\nOf the Princess of Wales in these years it is hard to speak too highly.\r\nFond of domestic life, retiring by disposition and character, caring\r\nmore for husband and family than for all the glitter and glory of the\r\nworld's greatest functions or positions, she yet lived in the blaze of\r\na continuous publicity without possible or actual criticism and with a\r\nceaseless and ready charm of manner, a never-failing courtesy to high\r\nand low, an ever-increasing popularity. Amid all the innumerable duties\r\nand difficulties of her position there has never been a visible mistake\r\ncommitted. The right people have been cultivated and encouraged; the\r\nwrong people treated in a way which could not be resented nor\r\nmisunderstood. The right thing has been said so often that it has come\r\nto appear the natural thing. An atmosphere of ideal refinement has\r\nalways surrounded her, and its subtle influence has pervaded many a\r\nbrilliant home and circle where other influences might easily have\r\nprevailed. In a time when calumny would attack an Archangel, and when\r\nits bitter barbs have been known to reach even the humanly perfect life\r\nof Queen Victoria, no shadow has ever crossed the curtain of her\r\ncharacter. Of her tact--a quality which she possesses in common with the\r\nPrince of Wales--stories are innumerable, and of her quiet,\r\nunostentatious, continuous charity and natural kindliness of heart there\r\nare as many more.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BUSY MARRIED LIFE\r\n\r\nThe married life of the Prince and Princess was a busy one. Sandringham\r\nhad to be remodelled and various public duties attended to by the\r\nHeir-Apparent. One of the first visitors at their country home was the\r\nRev. Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, who had been so intimately associated with\r\nthe education and early life of the Prince, and who was destined to\r\nalways possess the privileges of a personal friend. Of this Easter\r\nSunday, following the wedding, Dean Stanley wrote in his _Diary_ that\r\n\"the Princess came to me in a corner of the drawing-room with Prayer\r\nBook in hand and I went through the common service with her, explaining\r\nthe peculiarities and the likenesses and differences from the Danish\r\nservice. She was most simple and fascinating. My visit to Sandringham\r\ngave me intense pleasure. I was there for three days. I read the whole\r\nservice, preached, then gave the first English Sacrament to this 'angel\r\nin the Palace,' I saw a great deal of her, and can truly say she is as\r\ncharming and beautiful a creature as ever passed through a fairy tale.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE IN PUBLIC LIFE\r\n\r\nOne of the first public appearances of the Prince of Wales after his\r\nmarriage was attendance at the Royal Academy Banquet on May 2nd, 1863.\r\nSir Charles Eastlake, the President, proposed the usual loyal toast, and\r\nin responding the young Prince is said to have spoken in a particularly\r\nclear and pleasing manner. Of the important personal event to which\r\nreference had been made he declared that neither the Princess nor\r\nhimself could \"ever forget the manner in which our union has been\r\ncelebrated throughout the nation.\" Amongst the other speakers were Lord\r\nPalmerston, Mr. W. M. Thackeray and Sir Roderick Murchison. The first\r\nreally important public event in the Prince's life at this period was\r\nthe presentation of the freedom of the City of London on June 8th.\r\nInvitations had been issued to a couple of thousand of the most eminent\r\npersons in the public, social and diplomatic life of the country and\r\nexceedingly costly preparations were made for the reception, and for the\r\nball and banquet which followed. The Prince and Princess of Wales were\r\naccompanied by Prince Alfred, the Duchess of Cambridge, the Duke and\r\nPrincess Mary of Cambridge and other Royal personages. The Princess was\r\nclad in white, with a coronet and brooch of diamonds and a necklace of\r\nbrilliants--the one her husband's wedding present and the other that of\r\nthe City of London. The reply to the address and presentation was very\r\nbrief but appropriate and the events which followed were remarkable for\r\ntheir splendour and air of general joyousness.\r\n\r\nA week later the Royal couple attended the Commemoration at Oxford and\r\nthe Prince of Wales was presented with the degree of D.C.L. in the\r\npresence of a brilliant assemblage of Professors and visitors, and an\r\nenthusiastic throng of students. The latter gave the Princess a\r\nreception which made her flush with mingled nervousness and pleasure\r\nthough it could not affect her natural dignity of bearing. She had not\r\nyet become accustomed to the overwhelming character which British\r\nenthusiasm sometimes assumes and, indeed, is said to have never\r\nabsolutely overcome a personal shrinking from the publicity which was\r\ninseparable from her position and popularity. However that may be, the\r\nfeeling was never shown to the people and, if a fact, can only be\r\nconsidered as enhancing the graciousness of manner which has been so\r\nmarked a characteristic of her life in England. During this brief visit\r\nto Oxford Their Royal Highnesses distributed prizes to the Rifle\r\nVolunteers, opened a bazaar in aid of the Radcliffe Infirmary, inspected\r\nthe exhibits at the Horticultural Show, and went over the Prince's\r\none-time college residence at Frewen Hall.\r\n\r\nA hasty visit to the North of England in August was made to include the\r\nopening ceremony for a new Town Hall at Halifax and here the Royal\r\ncouple received a most hearty welcome. Another function was the opening\r\nof the British Orphan Asylum on June 24th by the Prince, who became its\r\nPatron and promoted large subscriptions to its work--one of which from\r\nMr. Edward Mackensie totalled $60,000. Though this was a very quiet year\r\nin comparison with those of the future, His Royal Highness extended his\r\npatronage, usually accompanied by liberal subscriptions, to eight public\r\ncharities, eight hospitals and asylums, five agricultural societies and\r\neleven learned and scientific societies--including the Society of Arts\r\nof which he became President. His first work in this latter connection\r\nwas to promote and obtain a fund for sending a number of British\r\nworkmen to the Paris Exhibition with a view to improving their\r\nmechanical and technical knowledge. He also associated himself with the\r\nMendicity Society by means of which all the innumerable appeals for aid\r\nwhich came to him from time to time were investigated, sifted, and\r\nreported upon before action was taken. On May 18, 1864 the Prince\r\npresided for the first time at the Royal Literary Fund banquet and thus\r\ncommenced a long period of active patronage toward an institution which\r\nhas served a most useful purpose in England--the quick and secret\r\ndispensing of aid to literary men who from some cause or other might be\r\ndestitute, or in need. Its objects were not local but international and\r\nin his speech on this occasion His Royal Highness pointed how well and\r\nquietly the work had been done.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCESS AND HER FAMILY\r\n\r\nEarly in the year the first-born child of the Royal couple arrived on\r\nthe scene. The event had been expected for March 1864 but the infant was\r\nborn at Frogmore on January 9th and was christened on March 10th as\r\nAlbert Victor Christian Edward. From infancy the Prince was somewhat\r\ndelicate and, no doubt for that reason, was always supposed to be his\r\nmother's favourite child. The Princess of Wales was, at this time, not\r\nyet twenty but was devoted to her domestic duties and especially to the\r\nnew arrival in their home. She would rather visit the nursery at any\r\ntime than attend a State function or ball. Other children came in the\r\nfollowing years. Prince George Frederick Ernest Albert, afterwards\r\nPrince of Wales, was born on June 3, 1865; Princess Louise Victoria\r\nAlexandra Dagmar, afterwards Duchess of Fife, on February 20, 1867;\r\nPrincess Victoria Alexandra Olga Mary on July 6, 1868; and Princess Maud\r\nCharlotte Mary Victoria, sometime to be Princess Charles of Denmark, on\r\nNovember 26, 1869. In 1871 Prince Alexander John Charles Albert was\r\nborn, but only lived for one brief day.\r\n\r\nAs these children came one by one they found a most happy home circle\r\nand a devoted mother. In all their little amusements and games the\r\nPrincess took part; in their training and education she took a watchful\r\nshare; in their lives as a whole simplicity was made the guiding\r\nprinciple, as it had been in the Royal family of the past generation.\r\nFrom all accounts which are open to us she delighted much more in the\r\nnursery than in society. Dr. William Jenner saw the Royal children\r\nwhenever necessary but the \"coddling\" so often seen in modern homes was\r\nunknown at Sandringham. The Prince believed as much in simplicity of\r\nbringing up as did his wife and, by special order, the Household and\r\nservants never used the prefix of \"Royal Highness\" to the children but\r\naddressed them as Prince Eddy, or Princess Louise, or whatever the name\r\nmight be. The little girls, as their father always called them, had\r\ntheir tea with the nurses and were given few toys and never allowed to\r\naccept presents. No fuss was made over the little accidents inevitable\r\nto childhood and in every way life was kept devoid of state formality,\r\nor anything that would breed a sense of childish self-importance. When\r\nthe Prince and Princess were away from home, as they frequently had to\r\nbe, letters were daily exchanged with the head nurse. The result of this\r\ngeneral system and of the later plan of making the young Princesses more\r\nand more companions of their mother and the boys, as far as\r\ncircumstances would permit, of their father, created and maintained at\r\nSandringham one of the most pleasant home circles in all England. An\r\nillustration of the spirit in which domestic anniversaries and incidents\r\nwere approached may be found in lines composed by the Princess, on one\r\noccasion, for Prince George when the family were commencing to celebrate\r\nthe birthday of the husband and father. The thought was admirable even\r\nif the poetry was not quite perfect:\r\n\r\n    \"Day of pleasure, brightly dawning,\r\n    Take the gift of this sweet morning,\r\n    Our best hopes and wishes blending\r\n    Must yield joy that's never ending.\"\r\n\r\nDuring these years the Prince of Wales was gradually assuming many of\r\nthe duties and public tasks which would have devolved upon the Queen, or\r\nin earlier days have been performed with such fidelity and care by the\r\nPrince Consort. At this time the Queen was living in strict retirement\r\nand for a long period still to follow she maintained the same sorrowing\r\nseclusion in a more or less modified form. Toward the close of 1865 the\r\ndeath of Lord Palmerston removed a statesman in whom the Prince had\r\nfound a personal friend and whom he had consulted and greatly trusted in\r\nprivate matters. In February, 1866, the Queen made one of her rare\r\npublic appearances and opened Parliament, in person, accompanied by the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales. A little later came the cholera epidemic\r\nwhich killed one hundred thousand people in Austria and caused a number\r\nof deaths in England. To the Mansion House Relief Fund, which ultimately\r\nreached the total of $350,000 and to another Fund, the Prince\r\ncontributed $17,500. In August the Royal couple visited Studley Royal,\r\nthe seat of the Earl de Grey and Ripon--better known afterwards as the\r\nMarquess of Ripon--and were given a great reception in the City of York.\r\nAn incident of the latter occasion was a sudden downpour of rain during\r\nwhich the Prince stood up in his carriage, bareheaded, so that the\r\npeople should not be disappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS PUBLIC FUNCTIONS AND EVENTS\r\n\r\nA little before this, on May 9th, the President and Council of the\r\nInstitution of Civil Engineers entertained the Heir Apparent at a\r\nbanquet in London and amongst the other guests were the veteran Field\r\nMarshal Sir John Burgoyne, the Dukes of Sutherland and Buccleuch, Earl\r\nGrey, Lord Salisbury, Sir John Pakington, Sir Edwin Landseer, Sir\r\nRichard Owen and many other eminent scientists and leaders of the time.\r\nDuring his speech the Prince paid a tribute to the work of Brunel and\r\nStephenson and, in the latter connection, referred to the great bridge\r\nacross the St. Lawrence, in Canada, which he had inaugurated in 1860 and\r\nto which he gave the credit for an opportunity to visit British America\r\nand the United States. On June 11th His Royal Highness had also laid the\r\nfoundation of the new building of the British and Foreign Bible Society\r\nin London. He was received formally by the President, the Earl of\r\nShaftsbury, the Lord Mayor, the Archbishop of York and others and, in\r\nthe course of his speech, pointed out that the Society had already spent\r\n$30,000,000 in the promotion of its objects and in the translation of\r\nthe Bible into two hundred and eighty different languages and dialects.\r\nAfter referring to the efforts in this cause by his grandfather, the\r\nDuke of Kent, the Prince went on to say that \"it is my hope and trust\r\nthat, under Divine guidance, the wider diffusion and deeper study of the\r\nScriptures will, in this as in every age, be at once the surest\r\nguarantee of the progress and liberty of the mind and the means of\r\nmultiplying in the present time the consolations of our holy religion.\"\r\n\r\nThe next function shared in was the anniversary gathering of the Clergy\r\nCorporation, attended by the Archbishops of Canterbury, York and Armagh,\r\nthe Marquess of Salisbury and other dignitaries. In his speech the\r\nPrince pointed out that there were ten thousand clergymen in the United\r\nKingdom whose benefices were of less value than $750 a year and urged\r\nthe usefulness of an institution which distributed $20,000 per annum to\r\norphans and unmarried daughters of clergymen as well as temporary aid to\r\nnecessitous clergymen themselves. The result of his appeal was a\r\nsubscription of $6,000 to which he contributed $525 personally. On June\r\n18th he inaugurated a Warehousemen and Clerks' School at Croydon at a\r\ngathering presided over by Earl Russell and ten days later visited the\r\nMerchant Seamen's Orphan Asylum in the suburbs of London. In August the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales made one of their first public appearances\r\nin the County where they had made their country home and where the\r\nPrince so well embodied the hearty, healthy life of the English\r\ngentleman. During the month, therefore, they paid a visit to Norwich as\r\nthe principal town of Norfolk and, accompanied by the Queen of Denmark\r\nand the Duke of Edinburgh, attended one of Sir Michael Costa's\r\noratorios, opened a Drill-hall, planted memorial trees and in other ways\r\nhelped to make the occasion memorable to the people of the ancient town.\r\n\r\nA visit followed in the autumn to the Duke and Duchess of Sutherland, at\r\ntheir splendid Castle of Dunrobin, in the north of Scotland. In driving\r\ntwenty-five miles from the station to the Castle a most enthusiastic\r\nwelcome was received along the entire route. In reviewing the Sutherland\r\nVolunteers during his stay the Prince expressed a wish that the Corps\r\nwould wear the kilt as their uniform and this was, of course, done with\r\nthe greatest pleasure. Shortly after the return from Scotland the Queen\r\nof Denmark came again to England and stayed for some time at Sandringham\r\nwith her daughter. Late in the year (November) the Prince of Wales went\r\nto St. Petersburg to attend in an official capacity the marriage of the\r\nPrincess Dagmar of Denmark--sister of his wife--to the Czarewitch who\r\nafterwards became Alexander III. The cold was deemed a sufficiently\r\nstrong reason for the Princess not to accompany him. In his suite were\r\nLord Frederick Paulet, the Marquess of Blandford, Viscount Hamilton, and\r\nMajor Teesdale. He was welcomed at the station by the Emperor, the\r\nCzarewitch and others of the Imperial family and given splendid\r\nquarters at the Hermitage Palace. After the marriage he visited Moscow,\r\naccompanied by the Crown Prince of Denmark, went over the historic\r\nKremlin and called on the Metropolitan, the highest dignitary in the\r\nRussian Church, who received his Royal visitor in a cell and gave him\r\nhis blessing after a brief conversation.\r\n\r\nThe year 1867 was marked by a painful illness of the Princess through\r\nacute rheumatism and inflammation of a knee-joint. During the serious\r\nperiod of the illness the Prince devoted himself to the invalid, never\r\nleaving her side unless compelled to do so and having his desk brought\r\ninto the sick-room so that he might carry on his correspondence in her\r\npresence. It was not until July that the Princess was able to drive out\r\nand during the rest of the year the Royal couple lived very quietly and\r\nmade as few public appearances as possible. It was in the beginning of\r\nthis year that Princess Louise, afterwards Duchess of Fife, was born.\r\nSome functions had to be performed, however, and they included the\r\npresiding at a meeting of the National Lifeboat Institution and at the\r\none hundred and fifty-second anniversary festival of the Welsh Society\r\nof Ancient Britons, on March 1st; a visit to the International\r\nExhibition at Paris in May; and the presence of the Prince at the laying\r\nof the foundation stone of the Albert Hall, in London, later in the same\r\nmonth. On July 10th His Royal Highness inaugurated the London\r\nInternational College, which had been organized by Mr. Cobden and M.\r\nMichel Chevalier, as a branch of an international institution. At the\r\nluncheon were the Duc d'Aumale, the Prince de Joinville and the Comte de\r\nParis as well as Professor Huxley and Dr. Leonard Schmitz, the head of\r\nthe institution. In his speech the Prince pointed out the usefulness of\r\na College which would more or less devote itself to the teaching of\r\nmodern languages at a time when the interests of varied nationalities\r\nwere becoming so intermingled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CORONATION OF EDWARD'S QUEEN\r\n  Queen Alexandra received her crown at the hands of the venerable\r\n  Archbishop of York at Westminster Abbey, August 9, 1902, immediately\r\n  after the crowning of the King by the Archbishop of Canterbury]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING EDWARD VII AND QUEEN ALEXANDRA\r\n  At the Opening of Parliament]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROYAL LINE OF SUCCESSION AT THE TIME OF QUEEN\r\nVICTORIA'S DIAMOND JUBILEE\r\n  Queen Victoria, Prince of Wales, Duke of York and Prince Edward]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CORONATION CHAIR\r\n  Containing the Stone of Scone on which traditional Irish Kings, Scotch\r\n  Kings and British Kings have been crowned]\r\n\r\nAn interesting event occurred in July when Ismail Pasha, Khedive of\r\nEgypt, visited England, as his father had done twenty-one years before.\r\nAt a banquet in the Mansion Home, on July 11th, a distinguished\r\ngathering met to do him honour and amongst them were the Prince of\r\nWales, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and many men\r\neminent in politics and diplomacy. In his speech the Prince spoke of his\r\npersonal indebtedness to the late Khedive for kindness received during\r\nhis own visit to Egypt in 1862 and, also, of the national importance of\r\nthe facilities given by that country to England in the transit of troops\r\nto India. He then referred to the illness of the Princess and to the\r\nwords in that connection used by the Lord Mayor. \"I know I only express\r\nher feelings when I say that she has been deeply touched by that\r\nuniversal good feeling and sympathy which has been shown to her during\r\nher long and painful illness. Thank God, she has now nearly recovered\r\nand I trust that in a month's time she will be able to leave London and\r\nenjoy the benefits of fresh air.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL VISIT TO IRELAND\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales early in his public life showed his sympathy with\r\nthe people of Ireland. He had already visited Dublin in 1865 and, on\r\nMarch 17, 1868, while planning a State visit to that country, attended a\r\nbrilliant celebration of the anniversary of St. Patrick's birth, in\r\nWillis's Rooms, London. Amongst those present were the Archbishop of\r\nArmagh, the Bishop of Derry, the Earl of Longford, the Earl of Mayo and\r\nLord Kimberley. The Prince, in his speech, expressed the belief that\r\ndespite disagreeable occurrences of the past few years the people of\r\nIreland generally were \"thoroughly true and loyal.\" On April 15th the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales landed at Kingstown and were received with\r\ntremendous acclaim. With his usual tact the Prince asked that no troops\r\nshould be present in the streets. The Princess, who was dressed in Irish\r\npoplin, was presented with a white dove, emblematic of peace, and fairly\r\ncaptured the hearts of the populace. The visit lasted ten days and\r\nincluded amongst its functions a gorgeous installation of the Prince as\r\na Knight of St. Patrick, when he used the sword worn by George IV. on a\r\nsimilar occasion; his presence at the Punchestown races--where the Royal\r\ncouple appeared in open carriages and received an enthusiastic welcome;\r\nattendance at the Royal Hibernian Academy's rooms and at the Royal\r\nDublin Society's Conversazione; a visit to the Catholic University and\r\nthe receipt of an LL.D.--together with the Duke of Cambridge and Lord\r\nAbercorn, the Lord Lieutenant--from Trinity College; a visit to the\r\nCattle Show and a Royal review of troops; attendance at Sunday service\r\nin historic Christ Church; personal visits to Lord Powerscourt's\r\nbeautiful place in Wicklow and to the Duke of Leinster at Carton; a\r\nformal visit to Maynooth College and the unveiling in Dublin of a statue\r\nof Edmund Burke.\r\n\r\nThe London _Times_ described the crowded life of those ten days in\r\nrather interesting language: \"There were presentations and receptions,\r\nand receiving and answering addresses, processions, walking, riding and\r\ndriving, in morning and evening, in military, academic and mediæval\r\nattire. The Prince had to breakfast, lunch, dine and sup with more or\r\nless publicity every twenty-four hours. He had to go twice to races with\r\nfifty or a hundred thousand people about him; to review a small army and\r\nmake a tour in the Wicklow Mountains, everywhere receiving addresses\r\nunder canopies and dining in state under galleries full of spectators.\r\nHe visited and inspected institutions, colleges, universities,\r\nacademies, libraries and cattle shows. He had to take a very active part\r\nin assemblies of from several hundred to several thousand dancers and\r\nalways to select for his partners the most important personages. He had\r\nto listen to many speeches sufficiently to know when and what to answer.\r\nHe had to examine with respectful interest pictures, books, antiquities,\r\nrelics, manuscripts, specimens, bones, fossils, prize beasts and works\r\nof Irish art. He had never to be unequal to the occasion, however\r\ndifferent from the last, or however like the last, and whatever his\r\ndisadvantage as to the novelty or dullness of the matter and the scene.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 25th the Royal visitors returned to Holyhead and on their way\r\nhome stopped at Carnarvon, the birthplace of the first Prince of Wales,\r\nwhere a banquet was received and a brief speech made by the living\r\nsuccessor of a great King's son. Among the incidents connected with this\r\nvisit was the fact that while the Prince was freely passing through and\r\namongst the people of the Irish capital his brother, the Duke of\r\nEdinburgh, was shot at Clontarf, Australia, by an Irishman named\r\nO'Farrell, while he was accepting the hospitality of a local Sailors'\r\nHome. Another was the tact and judgment displayed by the Heir Apparent\r\nin forwarding a cheque to the Dublin Hospital Sunday Fund after his\r\nreturn home. This institution had then and has since exercised a most\r\nbeneficial effect upon Irish hospital affairs; but the marvel was that\r\nthe Prince should have found time amid his multifarious duties and\r\nfunctions to look into its management and influence. May the 5th, saw\r\nthe Prince attending the sixty-second anniversary of the \"Society of\r\nFriends of Foreigners in Distress\" and pointing out in a preliminary\r\nspeech that the Queen had taken deep interest in this charity ever since\r\nher accession in 1837. In proposing the health of the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales, Sir Travers Twiss, the Advocate-General, said that\r\nthough it was not generally known, he would take the liberty of stating\r\nthat during His Royal Highness' Eastern travels he had passed through no\r\ngreat city without visiting and helping any institutions which might\r\nexist in aid of suffering humanity.\r\n\r\nEight days later the Prince presided at the annual banquet of the\r\nGovernors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital--after visiting and inspecting\r\nthe wards. During the same day His Royal Highness attended a great state\r\nfunction in the laying of the foundation of St. Thomas' Hospital by the\r\nQueen in person. The last important matter in which the Prince took part\r\nbefore leaving for his second Eastern tour was the laying of the\r\nfoundation stone of new buildings for Glasgow University on October 8th.\r\nThey cost over two millions of dollars and in the stately proceedings\r\naccompanying this event, the Princess of Wales was able to participate.\r\nFrom November 1868 to May 1869 the Royal couple were in the distant\r\nEast, but, on the Queen's birthday in the latter year, the Prince of\r\nWales was able to be present at the anniversary banquet of the Royal\r\nGeographical Society and to receive congratulations on having been\r\ninstrumental in effecting the appointment of his late travelling\r\ncompanion, Sir Samuel Baker, to the government of the Soudan region in\r\nAfrica, under the control of the Egyptian Government and with the object\r\nof suppressing the slave trade. His Royal Highness warmly eulogized Sir\r\nS. Baker--who had also just received the Society's medal for the\r\nyear--and the events of the evening were considered to have made the\r\noccasion memorable. Prince Hassan of Egypt was present and amongst the\r\nspeakers were Sir Roderick Murchison, Admiral Sir George Back, Professor\r\nOwen, the Duke of Sutherland, Dr. W. H. Russell, Sir Francis Grant\r\nP.R.A., and Sir Henry Rawlinson.\r\n\r\nThe next two or three years saw the Prince participating in many public\r\nand more or less important events. Accompanied by the Princess of Wales\r\nhe laid the foundation of new buildings in connection with the Earlswood\r\nAsylum, in Surrey, on June 28, 1869. An incident of this event was not\r\nonly the usual gift of a hundred guineas by the Prince but a procession\r\nof ladies who passed up to the dais in single file and deposited\r\nupwards of four hundred purses, which they had collected for the\r\nCharity, under the influence of Royal patronage and encouragement. On\r\nJuly 7th Their Royal Highnesses visited Lynn, inaugurated the new\r\nAlexandra Dock, and took part in several local events. A state visit to\r\nManchester followed, on July 29th, and the Prince opened the annual\r\nexhibition of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, of which he was\r\nPresident, and was given a warm welcome in and around the city. On the\r\nsucceeding day he inaugurated a new dock at Hull.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on July 23rd, the Prince had visited London in order to\r\nunveil a statue of George Peabody, the distinguished American\r\nphilanthropist. At the ceremony Sir Benjamin Phillips, Chairman of the\r\nCommittee, addressed the Prince formally and thus concluded: \"Let us\r\nhope that this statue, erected by the sons of free England to the honour\r\nof one of Columbia's truest and noblest citizens, may be symbolical of\r\nthe peace and good will that exist between the two countries.\" In\r\nreplying His Royal Highness spoke of Mr Peabody as a great American\r\ncitizen and of his gift of over a quarter of a million pounds sterling\r\nto the charities of a country not his own, as being unexampled, and\r\nconcluded as follows: \"Be assured that the feelings which I personally\r\nentertain toward America are the same as they ever were. I can never\r\nforget the reception which I had there nine years ago and my earnest\r\nwish and hope is that England and America may go hand in hand in peace\r\nand prosperity.\" Following the example of King William IV., when Duke of\r\nClarence, and of the late Dukes of Kent, Sussex and Cambridge, the\r\nPrince of Wales presided on November 30th at the anniversary banquet of\r\nthe Scottish Corporation--or as it was popularly called the Scottish\r\nHospital--in order to mark his approval of an institution which had done\r\nmuch to assist, by means of pensions, poor and aged natives of Scotland\r\nliving in London; to afford temporary relief to Scotchmen in distress;\r\nor to educate poor Scottish children. On this occasion there was a\r\nlarge gathering which included Prince Christian and the Duke of\r\nRoxburghe and, after a speech from the Prince describing the objects and\r\nwork of the institution, it was announced that $12,500 had been\r\nspecially subscribed to the purposes of the Hospital--including $500\r\nfrom the Prince of Wales himself.\r\n\r\nExhibitions, in the years between his coming of age and his accession to\r\nthe Throne, were always favourite objects of attention and support at\r\nthe hands of Heir Apparent. He had already studied closely his father's\r\nconduct of the first great International Exhibition, and had himself\r\nopened one of the same kind at Dublin, and been present at an\r\nInternational Reformatory gathering and at the Paris Exhibition. On\r\nApril 4th, 1870, he presided at a meeting of the Society of Arts called\r\nto promote an International Educational Exhibition for the succeeding\r\nyear. Resolutions were passed to this end, and after an explanatory\r\nspeech from His Royal Highness and, it may be added here, the Exhibition\r\nwas duly opened on May 1st, 1871, by the Prince of Wales, with imposing\r\npageantry and with details worked out by his assistant in various future\r\nundertakings Sir Philip Cunliffe-Owen. On May 16, 1870, the Prince\r\npresided at the annual banquet of the Royal General Theatrical Fund,\r\nestablished as far back as 1839, for the relief and assistance of\r\nmembers, and of widows and orphans of members, of the dramatic\r\nprofession. During the evening, after a speech from the Royal chairman,\r\nMr. Buckstone, the well-known actor, spoke in warm words of the kindness\r\nof the Prince in attending their function: \"The duties he has to perform\r\nare so numerous and fatiguing that we only wonder how he gets through\r\nthem all. Even within these few days he has held a Levée; on Saturday\r\nlast he patronized a performance at Drury Lane in aid of the Dramatic\r\nCollege; then had to run away to Freemasons' Hall to be present at the\r\ninstallation of the Grand Master; and now we find him in the chair this\r\nevening; so what with _conversaziones_, laying foundation stones,\r\nopening schools, and other calls upon his little leisure, I think he may\r\nbe looked upon as one of the hardest working men in Her Majesty's\r\ndominions.\" This was a fact or condition not recognized very generally\r\nin those days; in after years it became a truism in popular opinion.\r\n\r\nSt. George's Hospital received the combined patronage of the Prince and\r\nPrincess on May 26th. The former occupied the chair and made an earnest\r\nappeal for aid to this most deserving institution. The Earl of Cadogan,\r\nwho was one of the Treasurers, announced a little later in the evening\r\nthat the Prince of Wales had handed him a check for two hundred guineas,\r\nthe Princess one for fifty guineas, and the Marquess of\r\nWestminster--afterwards the first Duke of that name--one for two hundred\r\nguineas. Amongst the other speakers on this occasion were Earl\r\nGranville, the Earl of Derby, the Earl of Carnarvon and Mr. W. H. Smith,\r\nM.P. On June 21st, His Royal Highness opened a new building in\r\nconnection with Dulwich College in Surrey; nine days later he and the\r\nPrincess opened new schools for the children of seamen near the London\r\nDocks; on July 1st they visited in state the ancient town of Reading and\r\nlaid the foundation stone of a new Grammar School. A week later the\r\nPrince had the congenial task of giving the Albert gold medal of the\r\nSociety of Arts to M. de Lesseps. As President of the Society he\r\naddressed the father of the Suez Canal, in French, and congratulated him\r\nupon the completion of his great undertaking, not only in a public\r\ncapacity, but \"as a personal friend.\" In his reply, M. de Lesseps said\r\nthat he had received much private encouragement from the late Prince\r\nConsort in the early stages of his enterprise, and that he could never\r\nforget that fact. It may be added here that the presentation of this\r\nMedal was always a peculiar pleasure to the Prince of Wales, and that\r\namongst those in after years who received it at his hands were Sir\r\nHenry Bessemer, M. Chevalier and Sir Henry Doulton.\r\n\r\nOn July 13th His Royal Highness, on behalf of the Queen, and accompanied\r\nby the Princess Louise and the grand officers of the Household, opened\r\nwith elaborate ceremony the new Thames Embankment. Three days later he\r\nopened the Workmen's International Exhibition at Islington in the name\r\nof the Queen. During this year the war between France and Germany caused\r\nthe Prince and his family keen interest and many natural anxieties. He\r\narranged for a special telegraph service so that news might reach him at\r\nonce and took an active part in associations and subscription lists for\r\naid to the wounded on both sides. The Royal family had such close\r\nrelations with that of Prussia through the Princess Royal and with that\r\nof France through long personal friendship with the Emperor and Empress\r\nthat the position of individual members, like the Heir Apparent, and his\r\nwife could be easily understood.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences was opened with stately and\r\nimposing ceremony by the Queen on March 29th, 1871. When Her Majesty,\r\naccompanied by the Princess of Wales and other members of the Royal\r\nfamily, had taken her place on the dais of a Hall containing eight\r\nthousand people and an orchestra of twelve hundred persons, under Sir\r\nMichael Costa, the Prince of Wales advanced and, as President of the\r\nProvisional Committee, detailed the origin and history of the project.\r\nHe then, after receiving a formal reply, declared the Hall open in the\r\nname of the Queen. On May 7th, following, the Prince presided at a\r\ndinner in aid of the Artists' Orphan Fund and, after explaining its\r\nuseful objects, expressed the wish that further contributions would be\r\noffered for the purpose in view. At the close of the affair the\r\nTreasurer announced subscriptions to the amount of $60,000, of which a\r\ncheck for $525 was from the Royal chairman. The Earlswood Asylum for\r\nIdiots was again visited by the Prince on May 17th, when he presided at\r\nthe anniversary dinner of the institution in London and explained its\r\ncontinued progress. Subscriptions of $21,000 were announced, of which\r\n$525 were given by the Prince. The same result followed his chairmanship\r\nof a dinner in aid of the Farningham Homes for Little Boys on June 2nd.\r\nHe pointed out that the institution was still in need despite a recent\r\nanonymous contribution of $5000. Before the close of the evening some\r\n$17,000 had been subscribed, including $750 from His Royal Highness.\r\nSuch incidents, often repeated, indicate better than many words the\r\nvalue attached to the Prince's presence and support of deserving\r\ncharities, and they also afford some proof of the generous expenditure\r\nof his private means for public benefit. On June 28th, the Prince acted\r\nas Chairman of the anniversary festival of the Royal Caledonian Asylum\r\nin London. There were three hundred and fifty guests present, mostly in\r\nHighland costume, and amongst them were Prince Arthur and the Duke of\r\nCambridge, the Dukes of Buccleuch and Richmond, the Marquess of Lorne\r\nand Marquess of Huntly, the Earls of Fife, Mar, and March.\r\n\r\nOn July 31st His Royal Highness again paid a visit to Dublin. He was\r\naccompanied by the Princess Louise, the Marquess of Lorne, and the young\r\nPrince Arthur--better known in later years as the Duke of Connaught. An\r\naddress was presented at Kingstown by the Lord Mayor and Corporation\r\nand, on the following day, the Royal visitors witnessed a cricket match,\r\nlunched with the officers of the Grenadier Guards and inspected the\r\ncattle, horses, and sheep of the Royal Agricultural Society's annual\r\nshow. In the evening the Prince of Wales presided at a great banquet of\r\nfour hundred and fifty guests, with galleries thronged with ladies. He\r\nmade several brief speeches and a particularly happy one in proposing\r\nthe health of Earl Spencer, the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. A series of\r\nengagements and entertainments followed, amongst which were a brilliant\r\nmilitary review in Phoenix Park and the installation of the Prince as\r\nGrand Patron of the Masonic Institution in Ireland. This was the last\r\nimportant event taken part in by His Royal Highness before the serious\r\nillness which, a little later, so greatly stirred the nation and\r\naffected himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTravels in the East\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore he came to the Throne the Prince of Wales had long been the most\r\ntravelled man in Europe. He had visited every Court and capital and\r\ncentre upon that Continent; he had toured the North American Continent\r\nfrom the capital of Canada to the capital of the United States and from\r\nthe historic heights of Quebec to the great western centre at Chicago;\r\nhe had visited the most noted lands of the distant East.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM EUROPE TO AFRICA\r\n\r\nIn 1862, his first visit to Egypt and the Holy Land had taken place, and\r\nnow, six years later, he was to make a more imposing and important tour\r\nof those and other countries in the company of his wife. On November\r\n17th, 1868, the Prince and Princess of Wales, accompanied by their three\r\neldest children and by Lady Carmarthen, General Sir W. Knollys,\r\nLieut.-Col. Keppel and Dr. Minter, left for the Continent and reached\r\nCompiègne on the morning of the 20th inst., in order to pay a visit to\r\nthe Emperor and Empress of the French. An incident of the hunt which\r\ntook place that afternoon was the rush of a stag at the Prince who, with\r\nhis horse, was completely knocked over. Amongst the shooting party were\r\nMarshal Bazaine, the Baron Von Moltke, the Marquess of Lansdowne and\r\nother well-known men of the day. After a stay of a few days here and at\r\nParis the Royal party proceeded on their journey and reached Copenhagen\r\non November 29th. The birthday of the Princess was celebrated two days\r\nlater in her old home.\r\n\r\nStockholm was reached on December 16th, and a visit of some days'\r\nduration paid to the King of Sweden. On December 28th the Prince and\r\nPrincess were back again with the Royal family of Denmark and attended a\r\nState Ball at the Christianborg Palace. In the middle of January they\r\nembarked in the yacht _Freya_, and at Hamburg the Royal children were\r\nsent home in charge of Lady Carmarthen, Sir William Knollys and Colonel\r\nKeppel. At Berlin, on January 17th, they were welcomed by the Crown\r\nPrince and Princess of Prussia--the Princess Royal of England--and by\r\nLord Augustus Loftus, the British Ambassador. On the following day His\r\nRoyal Highness was invested with the famous order of the Black Eagle by\r\nthe King of Prussia. Amongst the limited number of Knights Grand Cross\r\nwho were present at the Chapter were the Baron Von Moltke, General Von\r\nRoon, Count Von Waldersee, and Count Von Wrangel. From Berlin, where the\r\nPrince and Princess were joined by those who were to accompany them on\r\ntheir further journey and including Colonel Teesdale, V.C., Captain\r\nEllis, Lord Carington, Mr. Oliver Montague, Dr. Minter and the Hon. Mrs.\r\nWilliam Grey, the Royal party went to Vienna which was reached on\r\nJanuary 21st. At the station they were received by the Emperor Francis\r\nJoseph and various members of the Austrian Royal family together with\r\nPrince Von Hohenlohe and Lord Bloomfield, the British Ambassador. State\r\nvisits, dinners, the theatre, skating and a private visit to the King\r\nand Queen of Hanover in their retirement at Hietsing, constituted the\r\nprogramme of the next few days. Vienna was left on January 27th, and\r\nfrom Trieste, on the following day, sail was made on board H.M.S.\r\n_Ariadne_ and Alexandria reached on February 3rd.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIP UP THE NILE\r\n\r\nAfter their formal reception at Alexandria by Mehemet Tewfik Pasha,\r\nShereef Pasha, Mourad Pasha, Sir Samuel Baker and others, the Prince\r\nand Princess proceeded to Cairo where they were warmly welcomed by the\r\nKhedive, and met by the Duke of Sutherland and his son, Lord Stafford,\r\nProfessor Owen, Colonel Marshall and the special correspondent, Dr. W.\r\nH. Russell. The latter gentlemen joined the Royal party and were to\r\nproceed with them on the journey up the Nile together with Prince Louis\r\nof Battenberg and Lord Albert Gower. Before starting on this voyage,\r\nhowever, the Prince and Princess were privileged in witnessing the\r\ncurious Procession of the Holy Carpet and the departure of a portion of\r\nthe annual stream of pilgrims for Mecca. The Princess and Mrs. Grey were\r\nalso invited, on February 5th, to dine at the Harem with the Khedive's\r\nmother and the ceremonies, as described by Mrs. Grey in her _Diary_ of\r\nthe tour, were exceedingly interesting. A multitude of smartly dressed\r\nfemale slaves in coloured satin and gold; services of silver and gold;\r\ndishes of the most peculiar and varied composition and taste; music by\r\nbands of girls and dances by other bands of women--some of whose motions\r\nwere described by Mrs. Grey as graceful and others as \"simply\r\nfrightful;\" drinks of curious character and pipes and cigarettes with\r\nholders ornamented by masses of precious gems; costumes which partook of\r\nboth the Eastern and Western character; jewels and gold in every\r\ndirection and upon every possible kind of object--such were some of the\r\nthings seen during the visit. In the evening of the same day the Royal\r\ncouple and suite went to the theatre, and afterwards the Prince had\r\nsupper with the Khedive at the Palace of Gizerek, accompanied with\r\nelaborate ceremonies and a succession of dancing spectacles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, every care had been exercised by the Khedive in preparing\r\ncomforts for the Royal guests up the Nile. The chief barge was occupied\r\nby the Prince and Princess and the Hon. Mrs. Grey, who was in attendance\r\nupon the latter; a second was occupied by the Suite; a third by the Duke\r\nof Sutherland's party; a fourth was used as a store-boat and contained\r\n3,000 bottles of champagne, 20,000 bottles of soda-water, 4,000 bottles\r\nof claret and plenty of ale, liquors and light wines. Sir Samuel Baker,\r\nwho was at this time Governor of the Soudan region, accompanied the\r\nPrince and had with him an abundance of guns and nets for capturing\r\ncrocodiles, etc. During the slow progress up the river there was plenty\r\nof sport, and His Royal Highness won fine specimens of spoonbills,\r\nflamingoes, herons, cranes, cormorants, doves, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY VISIT SITES OF ANCIENT CITIES\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the trip there was not much that was\r\ninteresting; apart from the shooting expeditions which were undertaken\r\nfrom time to time. The sight of frightened children, timid women,\r\nlabouring slaves, mosques and villages of huts and occasional ruins of\r\nmore or less interest were all that was visible along the low banks of\r\nthe river as they passed. The caves, or grottoes, of Beni Hassan were\r\nvisited on February 10, and the life of ancient peoples seen in a\r\npanorama of carved monuments. Then came a more beautiful, cultivated and\r\npopulous part of the region watered by the Nile. Thebes, Luxor, Karnak,\r\nhowever, were names and places which made up for much. For two days,\r\nending February 19th, the heir to a thousand years of English\r\nsovereignty wandered amidst these tombs and monuments of the rulers of\r\nan African empire which had wielded vast power and created works of\r\nwonderful skill and genius three, and five thousand years before. The\r\ngreat hall and collonades and pillars of Karnac, the obelisk of Luxor,\r\nthe famous tombs of the Kings, the Temples of Rameses, the colossal\r\nstatues of Egyptian rulers, were visited by daylight, and, in some\r\ncases, the wondrous effect of Oriental moonlight upon these massive\r\nshapes and memorials of a mighty past was also witnessed.\r\n\r\nPhilæ with its interesting ruins, Assouan with its modern history,\r\nKorosko, Deré, the early capital of Nubia, the great Temple at Aboo\r\nSimbel, were seen, and, finally, after the Prince had killed his first\r\ncrocodile, on February 28th, and the party had made an uncomfortable\r\ntrip across a hot waste of desert, Wady Halfah was reached on March 2nd,\r\nand the journey back was commenced. On their return a special trip was\r\nmade by the Prince and Princess to the Pyramids of Ghizeh, accompanied\r\nby Mehemet Tewfik, the Khedive's son, with an escort from Cairo. The\r\nPrince ascended the biggest of the Pyramids and the party was royally\r\nentertained afterwards in a pavilion specially erected for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERESTING RUINS ARE VISITED\r\n\r\nThe Prince and Princess also visited the Royal chambers in the great\r\nPyramid. A delightful drive to Cairo followed, and the party soon found\r\nthemselves comfortably installed in the Esbekiah Palace. On the\r\nfollowing day a visit was paid to the great Mosque where lie the revered\r\nbones of Mehemet Ali, under an embroidered velvet catafalque. One of the\r\ngraceful minarets was ascended and a splendid panorama of the city seen.\r\nOn March 18 the Tombs of the Caliphs, with their picturesque but ruined\r\nmosques, were visited, and in the evening the theatre was attended, in\r\ncompany with His Highness, the Khedive. A visit to the Baulak Museum\r\nfollowed and was rendered thoroughly interesting by the presence of the\r\nlearned Orientalist, Marriette Bey, who showed the Prince and Princess a\r\nbust of the Pharaoh \"who would not let the children of Israel go,\" and\r\none of the other Pharaohs, who was a friend of Moses. Sir W. H. Russell\r\nis authority for the statement that the slightly incredulous smile of\r\nthe Princess brought out a most concise, learned and convincing\r\nexplanation of history and hieroglyphics in this connection.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of March 19th the Khedive gave a State Dinner in honour\r\nof his Royal guests at the Garden Kiosk of the new Palace of Gizeh. The\r\ngrounds were brilliantly illuminated, those present included all that\r\nwas eminent in the life of Egypt, the viands were served upon the\r\nrichest plate, the native fireworks sent up afterwards were most\r\nattractive. The Hon. Mrs. Grey, in her _Diary_, says that \"standing in\r\nthe outer marble court, with its beautiful Moorish arches and its\r\npillars of rich brown colour, their bases and capitals profusely and\r\nbrilliantly decorated, and looking on every side at the tastefully\r\nilluminated gardens, the effect produced was indeed most splendid and\r\ncarried one at once back in imagination to one of the scenes you read of\r\nin the _Arabian Nights_. It is quite impossible to describe it, but I\r\nshall never forget this beautiful sight.\" The writer then goes on to\r\ndescribe the splendid architecture and tasteful furniture of the\r\nbuilding and rooms. Most of the latter were decorated in white and gold,\r\nwith myriads of mirrors, rich silk curtains and furniture with all the\r\nsoft and brilliant colourings of the old Arabesque style. There were\r\nfountains everywhere, and the floors were inlaid marble, porphery and\r\nalabaster.\r\n\r\nFollowing this function came a visit to the British Mission School,\r\nwhere the Princess greatly charmed the children; a state visit to the\r\nraces in a carriage drawn by six horses, and with coachmen and\r\npostilions wearing most gorgeous liveries of scarlet and gold. The Suite\r\nwere also splendidly equipped in regard to carriages and outriders, and\r\nthe streets were lined with troops. The races were well conducted and\r\nthe general ceremonies of the occasion worthy of Ismail, the Khedive.\r\nThis was to have been the last function prior to departure for the Suez\r\nCanal, but it was now decided to accept the pressing invitation of His\r\nHighness and stay three days longer. Following upon this decision came a\r\nseries of visits paid by the Princess of Wales to the wives, or harems,\r\nof certain distinguished Egyptian gentlemen, and, finally, to the harem\r\nof the Khedive.\r\n\r\nAmongst the places visited were the homes of Murad Pasha, Abd-el-Kader\r\nBey and Achmet Bey. On March 23d the Princess, with a couple of\r\nattendant ladies, visited the Khedive's mother--the real ruler of his\r\nharem. It was a sort of Eastern drawing-room function, with slaves in\r\nbrightly-coloured dresses everywhere about, and a number of Princesses,\r\nor daughters and relations of the Khedive, present, together with many\r\nother ladies of Egyptian rank and position. Mrs. Grey described them as\r\nmostly pretty--which was not, in her experience, the case as a rule--and\r\nas looking cheerful and happy. In the evening the Princess attended a\r\nState Dinner given by the four wives of the Khedive at the Palace of\r\nGizerek. The presence of innumerable slaves, coffee and pipes, music and\r\ncherry jam served on a large gold tray with a gold service inlaid with\r\ndiamonds and rubies, were the initial features of the entertainment. At\r\ndinner the guests sat on chairs instead of on the floor, as at a\r\nprevious affair of the kind, but still had to pull the meat from the\r\nturkey with their fingers, while the odour of garlic and onions in many\r\nof the dishes was very unpleasant. There was some singing during the\r\nmeal, with music and Oriental dancing after it. Meanwhile the bazars had\r\nbeen visited privately by the Princess; the people having no idea who\r\nthe inquiring and interested European lady was.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE ATTENDS THE KHEDIVE'S RECEPTION\r\n\r\nOn the same day the Prince of Wales attended in state at a formal\r\nreception held by the Khedive, and thus conferred a somewhat marked\r\ncompliment upon one who was not actually an independent Sovereign. He\r\nwas accompanied by the Marquess of Huntly and the Earl of Gosford, who\r\nhad just arrived from India on their way home, and proceeded through\r\nthe streets in all the pomp of scarlet and gold outriders, troops in\r\nbrilliant uniforms and a general environment of state which compelled\r\nunusual respect from the impassive Oriental onlookers. Royal honours\r\nwere given to the Prince on his arrival, and he was met by some 5,000\r\ntroops and the strains of the British national anthem, while the Court\r\nitself was brilliant in blue and gold uniforms and rich in the\r\nluxuriance of gold and gems upon every possible article of service or\r\npersonal use. In the evening the Prince dined with his Vice-regal host\r\non a yacht in the river, and the Minister of Finance gave a brilliant\r\nbanquet, at which were present the great officers of state, such as\r\nShereef Pasha, Zulfikar Pasha, Abdallah Pasha and others, together with\r\nBritish visitors or members of the Royal suite, such as Lord Carington,\r\nLord Huntly, Lord Gosford, Prince Louis of Battenberg, Sir Samuel Baker\r\nand Colonel Teesdale, V.C.\r\n\r\nThis event closed the visit to Cairo and, after formal farewells on the\r\nfollowing morning, the train was taken for Suez, where the Royal\r\nvisitors were received by the Governor and M. de Lesseps. In the morning\r\nthey left for Ismaila amidst all possible honours, and accompanied by\r\nthe great canal promoter. There a triumphal arch had been erected and a\r\ncrowd of people and troops were found lining the route through the city.\r\nThey were driven out to the Khedive's chalet on Lake Timsah, where\r\ndinner was served and the night spent, and thence back to Ismaila, and,\r\nin a steamer, down the Suez Canal to Port Said. The great enterprise was\r\nnot then completed, and, in fact, the opening of the canal did not take\r\nplace for many months, but the Royal tourists were fortunate in seeing\r\nthe pioneer activities of creation in full operation and of being able\r\nto understand something of the immense initial difficulties which had\r\nbeen overcome by the genius and energy of De Lesseps.\r\n\r\nAlexandria was reached on March 27th, and visits were paid to\r\nRas-el-Teen, the old palace of Mehemet Ali, to Cleopatra's Needle and\r\nPompey's Pillar. Then the _Ariadne_ was boarded once more and a farewell\r\ndinner given to Mourad Pasha, the representative of the Egyptian\r\nGovernment, who had done so much for the comfort of the Royal guests;\r\nthe health of the Khedive was drunk and the last word said to the\r\nancient land of the Nile and the Pyramids. The impressions left by this\r\nvisit to Egypt were pleasant to the Prince of Wales and useful to his\r\ncountry. Ismail, the Khedive, was at this time a most enterprising ruler\r\nbut the predominant influence in the country was French and there can be\r\nno doubt that the stately reception given the Heir to the British Crown\r\nproved a substantial service to the present and future residents of his\r\nnationality in that part of the world. The Prince, himself, must have\r\nbenefited greatly by the insight into Oriental methods of government\r\nwhich he obtained and by the curious efforts at an adaptation of western\r\nideas which were going on all around him; while the picture left upon\r\nhis mind of ancient traditions and the history of a mighty past could\r\nnot but have been impressive and interesting.\r\n\r\nOn boarding the _Ariadne_, off Alexandria, and starting for\r\nConstantinople the Royal party lost Sir Samuel Baker, Lord Gosford, Sir\r\nHenry Pelly and Lord Huntly, who were leaving for other points of\r\ndestination. During the next few days the vessel passed through the\r\n\"Isles of Greece\" and by various famous or historic spots. Patmos and\r\nChios were seen for a time in the distance and, on March 31st, the\r\nDardanelles were reached and salutes fired from shore to shore--from\r\nEurope to Asia--as the Royal yacht steamed between the Turkish forts.\r\nUpon anchoring, the British Ambassador, the Hon. Henry Elliot, came on\r\nboard, together with Raouf Pasha, who attended to offer the earliest\r\ncompliments of his Imperial master the Sultan. At the next landing, off\r\nChanak, the Prince was formally welcomed by Eyoub Pasha, Military\r\nGovernor of the Dardanelles, and his staff and guard of honour. Salutes\r\nfrom the Forts followed and the Prince returned to his vessel which\r\nsteamed up to Gallipoli, where another stop was made and a visit paid to\r\nthe French and British cemeteries of the Crimean War. Early on the\r\nmorning of April 1st the towers and minarets of Constantinople were\r\nsighted and various tugs and boats containing British residents and\r\nothers surrounded the Royal vessel and joined in singing \"God Save the\r\nQueen\" as the Prince and Princess appeared on deck. Their stepping into\r\na barge to row ashore was the signal for a general salute from the\r\nTurkish iron-clads and, amidst flying colours, fully-manned yards and\r\nswarming caiques and steam-boats the journey to the shore was made--with\r\nsome private speculation as to what would happen to the Life Guardsmen\r\nof the Prince's suite if they should be upset in the water with all\r\ntheir cumbrous \"toggery\" on.\r\n\r\nWhen abreast of the Palace of Saleh Bazar the Royal barge was met by the\r\nstate caique of the Sultan, followed by other gorgeously decorated and\r\nequipped vessels, containing the Grand Vizier, Aali Pasha, and other\r\nofficials dressed in blue and gold and wearing numerous ribands, stars\r\nand crosses of knightly orders. Amidst cheers from crowded tugs and\r\nboats and ships the Royal visitors were transferred to the caique and\r\nthence to the landing place of the Palace where a guard of honour, a\r\ncrowd of officers and a gorgeous staff surrounded the Sultan who, like\r\nthe Prince of Wales, was in full uniform. His Majesty, after various\r\ngracious greetings, which were translated by the Grand Vizier, led his\r\nguests up the staircase of the Palace and then retired. Shortly\r\nafterwards the Prince and his suite were driven to the Dolmabakshi\r\nPalace where they were received by the Sultan with much state and, after\r\na brief visit, returned to Saleh Bazar. Luncheon followed and the Prince\r\nand Princess called at the British Embassy. On their way back in the\r\nSultan's carriages the streets were lined with impassive people who\r\nsaluted in silent respect. At the Palace an admirable dinner was served\r\non gold and silver plate. During the entire stay of the Royal visitors\r\nhere they were supplied with every luxury and requirement--guards of\r\nhonour, carriages, saddle-horses, caiques, a band of eighty-four\r\nsplendid musicians and an immense staff always on duty and clad in\r\ngorgeous uniforms of green and gold.\r\n\r\nEvery morning there were presents from the Sultan of most exquisite\r\nflowers and the finest fruit. Mr. W. H. Russell thus described the\r\nsurroundings in one of his letters to the London _Times_: \"The\r\n_valetaille_, in liveries of green and gold, with white cuffs and\r\ncollars, throng the passages and corridors, and black-coated\r\nChibouquejees are ready at a clap of the hands to bring in pipes with\r\namber mouth-pieces of fabulous value, crested with hundreds of diamonds\r\nand rubies, and coffee in tiny cups which fit into stands blazing with\r\nsimilar jewels. The _cuisine_ cannot be surpassed and the wines are of\r\nthe most celebrated vintage. All the persons attached to the Palace\r\nspeak French or English. There are Turkish baths inside ready at a\r\nmoment's notice. Equerries, aides-de-camp, officers of the Body-Guard,\r\nradiant in gold lace and scarlet, in blue and in silver lace, flit about\r\nthe saloons and corridors. Human nature can scarce sustain the load of\r\nobligations imposed on it by such attention. If the Prince is seen on\r\nthe water guards are turned out along all the batteries and the strains\r\nof music are borne on every breeze that blows. Yards are manned and\r\ncrews turned out on the slightest provocation. The least wish is an\r\norder.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 2nd the Sultan went in state to the Mosque in honour of his\r\nRoyal guests. The streets were lined with five thousand troops and the\r\nPrince and Princess, with their suite, were driven to the Palace of\r\nBeshik Jool, from a beautiful room in which they could see the Imperial\r\nprocession pass by. The sloping ground on the opposite side of the road\r\nwas filled by groups of women clad in varied colours and looking from a\r\ndistance like animated flowers. The Sultan came, presently, preceded by\r\nbrilliantly garbed Circassian troops, announced by the blast of a\r\ntrumpet and the acclaim of the Turkish populace and riding a magnificent\r\nhorse, which an English spectator described as a \"marvel of beauty.\" He\r\nwore a splendid military uniform and his jewelled orders and sabre-hilt\r\nshone brightly in the rays of the sun, while immediately before and\r\nbehind him were the officers of state. After the pageant had passed,\r\nlittle Prince Izzedin--the eldest son of the Sultan and a delicate,\r\nintelligent-looking child--came over to visit the Prince and Princess.\r\nThe troops then filed past the Palace windows. Later in the day a\r\ndeputation of British residents was received by the Prince and in the\r\nevening a special performance at the Theatre was attended and witnessed\r\nfrom the Sultan's box.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of April 3rd, the various foreign Ambassadors and\r\nMinisters called on the Prince of Wales and were presented by Mr.\r\nElliot. Amongst them was General Ignatieff, of Russia. A visit to\r\nSeraglio Point followed, and from its heights was seen that most\r\nexquisite view which embraces the Sweet Waters, the Bosphorus, the Sea\r\nof Marmora and its islands, the shores of Scutari, the minarets of the\r\ncity and a general mingling of sea and shore, of light and shade, of\r\nsoftness and Eastern charm which is hardly equalled in the world. The\r\ngreat mosque of St. Sophia was then visited. In the evening a state\r\ndinner was given by the Sultan at Dolmabakshi Palace--the first ever\r\ngiven by His Ottoman Majesty to Christian guests. The Prince and\r\nPrincess were received in the grand drawing-room by the Sultan and all\r\nhis Ministers. The Princess was taken in by His Majesty and Madame\r\nIgnatieff by the Prince. The dinner-room was already renowned for its\r\nexquisite candelabra and lustres in rock-crystal; and its other\r\ndecorations, combined with plate and flowers of the most beautiful kind,\r\nmade up a scene well worth remembering. Aside from this, however, it was\r\nnot very interesting, as none of the Sultan's Ministers--except the\r\nGrand Vizier--had ever sat in his presence before and were apparently\r\ntoo much astonished and afraid to speak a word to each other or to any\r\nof the twenty-four guests who made up the banquet. After dinner the\r\nPrincess and Mrs. Grey visited the Harem, or rather the Sultan's wife\r\nand mother. Mrs. Grey, in her _Diary_, declares the dullness and\r\nstiffness of the occasion to have been indescribable. There were\r\ninnumerable slaves, but they were all \"hideous,\" though loaded down with\r\njewels, while other incidents and surroundings were not very unlike a\r\nsimilar reception at a European Court. The whole affair broke up at\r\n10.30.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VARIETY OF INCIDENTS\r\n\r\nOn the following day the Royal party attended service in the church of\r\nthe British Embassy, driving through silent and crowded streets. In the\r\nafternoon they inspected the Cemetary at Scutari. On the following day\r\nthe Prince and Princess, attended by Mrs. Grey, and all garbed in the\r\nhumblest English clothes they could find, visited the Bazaar. \"Mr. and\r\nMrs. Williams\" seemed to enjoy themselves greatly, the former smoking a\r\nlong pipe; the latter buying quantities of curios and, as the merchants\r\nsoon found out, driving an occasional bargain with earnestness. They\r\ntook in all the entertainments, sipped sherbets and the various\r\nunnamable drinks which are sold in such places, and revelled in a few\r\nhours of freedom. Later in the day the Prince paid some formal visits\r\nand in the evening they again attended the theatre. Meanwhile Sir Andrew\r\nBuchanan, British Ambassador at St. Petersburg, had arrived with his\r\nwife, on their way home to England, and were welcomed at the Palace. The\r\nfollowing day a visit was paid to Belyar Beg, some distance up the\r\nBosphorus, which has been described as \"the most beautiful place in the\r\nmost beautiful situation in the world.\" Guards of honour were seen in\r\nall directions as the Royal party passed in caiques up the river. The\r\nluxury and elegance of the furniture at the Palace and the beauty of\r\nboth buildings and surroundings evoked expressions of admiration from\r\nthe Prince and Princess and, perhaps, they even regretted their refusal\r\nto stay here in preference for the other and more accessible residence.\r\nTchamlidja, not far away, the summer residence of Mustapha Fazil Pasha,\r\nbrother of the Viceroy of Egypt, was then visited and a \"luncheon\"\r\nserved which proved to be almost wanton in its luxury--the choicest\r\nfruits that Paris could produce and the finest wines of the east or the\r\nwest being served in profusion. Afterwards, the Princess and Mrs. Grey\r\nvisited the Harem, while the men smoked exquisite cigars and drank the\r\nfinest obtainable coffee.\r\n\r\nThe following day included a trip across the Bosphorus in the Sultan's\r\nyacht and a state ball at the British Embassy in the evening, which was,\r\nfor a short time, attended by the Padishah himself. The Royal party did\r\nnot retire from the gathering until daylight. During the next three days\r\none function continued to follow another. A visit to the British\r\nMemorial Church; attendance with the Sultan at a great special\r\nperformance in the Theatre through densely-crowded streets; a visit to a\r\ncricket match in the suburbs; attendance at a state banquet given by the\r\nBritish Ambassador; inspection by the Prince of a Turkish\r\nironclad--Hobart Pasha's flagship; a dinner at the country home of the\r\nGrand Vizier. The day of departure fixed upon was April 10th, and, after\r\na stately breakfast with the Sultan at Dolmabakshi, and farewells\r\nexchanged amidst all possible pomp and Oriental pageantry, the _Ariadne_\r\nwas boarded and slowly steamed away from the Moslem capital to the sound\r\nof cheers and thundering guns from fleet and fort. They were soon in\r\nthe gloomy waters of the Black Sea on the way to the Czar's dominions.\r\n\r\nArrangements had been under discussion for some time in connection with\r\nthis visit to the Crimea and Sir Andrew Buchanan's opportune arrival\r\nhad, no doubt, a good deal to do with the matter. On April 12th\r\nSebastopol was sighted, crowned with its ruined bastions and replete to\r\nthe Royal tourists with memories of the Redan, the Malakoff, and the\r\nMamelon. Neither flags nor men were visible, however, upon the ramparts\r\nas the yacht came to its moorings although elsewhere Russian soldiers\r\ncould be occasionally seen. Presently, General de Kotzebue, Governor of\r\nNew Russia and Bessarabia, came on board with his suite--a decorated and\r\nenergetic survivor of the great siege at which he had been Chief of\r\nStaff to Prince Gortschakoff. After the four days programme for the\r\nCrimea had been settled the Prince and Princess landed and went first to\r\ninspect the Memorial Chapel and then to visit the great cemetery. A\r\ndrive to some of the scenes of battle during the Crimean conflict\r\nfollowed, with an escort of Tartars and with carriage horses which at\r\ntimes seemed to fly over the ground. General de Kotzebue knew every foot\r\nof the soil and was, of course, a splendid host on such an occasion. On\r\nthis first day the field of the desperate Alma fight was gone over\r\ncarefully and on the succeeding morning the ruined ramparts and redoubts\r\nof the once great Fortress of Sebastopol--not as yet restored--were\r\nvisited and studied. The Cemetery of Cathcart's Hill was visited and\r\nhere there were few in the party who did not find the names of friends\r\nor relatives in this city of silent streets while the Princess found\r\nvery many around which associations of some kind were twined. In a small\r\nfarmhouse, close to the windmill which was almost a centre of battle on\r\nthe day of Inkerman, the Royal party took lunch.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the Prince and some of the gentlemen rode over the ridge\r\naround which the famous fight occurred and General de Kotzebue\r\nexplained the technical character of the struggle. The Malakoff was next\r\nseen as well as the colossal statue of Lazareff--the father of the Black\r\nSea fleet and of that conception of Russian power which was shattered\r\nfor a time by the success of the Allies. On the 14th the French Cemetery\r\nwas visited and thence they went across country to the famous British\r\nHeadquarters--the home for so long of Lord Raglan, General Simpson and\r\nSir W. Codrington. The house was in perfect order and the Prince was\r\nshown with care one of the rooms on the wall of which was a tablet with\r\nthe simple words: \"Lord Raglan died.\" Balaclava was next visited and the\r\nscene of the famous charge carefully studied by the Prince. A drive\r\nfollowed through a country of varied and striking beauty to the Imperial\r\nPalace of Livadia where the Czar's Master of Ceremonies, Count Jules\r\nStenbock, was waiting to receive the Royal visitors. A ceremonious\r\nentertainment was given here in the highest style of refinement and with\r\nthe somewhat unexpected accompaniments of chamberlains in green and gold\r\nand a mass of servants from St. Petersburg, together with every sort of\r\nluxury. Here the Czar Nicholas had stayed in 1855 when he went to\r\nreconnoitre the position of the Allies. A visit followed to Alupka, the\r\npalace of Prince Woronzow and thence, after an exchange of telegrams\r\nwith the Czar, they went on board the _Ariadne_ once more.\r\n\r\nApril the 16th saw the Royal party once more in the Bosphorus with blue\r\nlights burning along the shores and bands playing a courteous welcome.\r\nOn the following day the Prince, attended by Colonel Teesdale and\r\nCaptain Ellis, paid a last formal visit to the Sultan and this was\r\npromptly returned by His Majesty amidst much ceremony. Meanwhile, the\r\nPrincess had taken a last fond \"incognito\" look at the Bazaars attended\r\nby Mrs. Grey and Mr. Moore of the Embassy. The Ambassador came to the\r\nyacht to luncheon and soon afterwards Sir Andrew and Lady Buchanan bade\r\nfarewell. Then, in the evening, came the second departure from\r\nConstantinople, the _Ariadne_ passing through the lately increased\r\nTurkish fleet, under Hobart Pasha, amidst a brilliant display of\r\nrockets, coloured lanterns and blue lights.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO HISTORIC ATHENS\r\n\r\nThe Port of Athens was reached on April the 20th and here Sir A.\r\nBuchanan once more rejoined the party, followed very soon by various\r\nRussian, French and Italian officers and diplomatists. Next came the\r\nKing of Greece--George I., brother of the Princess of Wales--accompanied\r\nby a suite and with sounds of distant cheering and the roar of guns\r\nechoing around the vessel. After luncheon Athens was visited and found\r\nto be gaily decorated and thence the Royal party passed by train to the\r\nKing's Palace in the country, a beautiful place surrounded by beautiful\r\nscenery. In the distance were to be seen the green fields and olive\r\nforests of the Attic plain, the Piræus and the Bay of Salamis, the\r\ngroves of Academus, the ancient Acropolis and Ilissus, and the modern\r\nCity of Athens. On the following day the Acropolis was visited and the\r\nglories of that scene of historic greatness revived in the memories of\r\nthe Royal travellers. A state banquet followed in the evening and on the\r\nnext day a number of memorable sights and scenes were visited while the\r\nevening was the occasion for a coloured and very striking illumination\r\nof the mighty ruins of the Acropolis. Athens was left behind on the 23rd\r\nof April and the Royal party, including the King and Queen of Greece,\r\nproceeded to Corfu, which was reached on the following day and a more\r\nkindly greeting accorded to the visitors. The stay here was a very quiet\r\none enlivened, so far as the Prince of Wales was concerned, by a hunting\r\nparty on the somewhat wild coast of Albania. May 1st saw a formal\r\nleave-taking from the King and Queen of the Hellenes and a departure\r\nfrom this pleasant old-world Island.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Brindisi was reached, and Turin on the 3rd.\r\nAccompanied by Sir Augustus Paget, the Minister at Rome, the Royal party\r\ncrossed the mountains by the Mont Cenis Railway and reached Paris two\r\ndays afterwards. Here, until May the 11th, they remained in a succession\r\nof visits, dinners, reviews and entertainments provided by the Emperor\r\nand Empress, and on the following day arrived at Marlborough House after\r\na six months' absence from England. It had been a round of arduous duty\r\nmixed with every form of honour and compliment, and including much of\r\ngenuine pleasure and useful experience, together with the acquisition of\r\npractical and valuable knowledge. To the Heir Apparent it was one more\r\nstep in the training and education necessary for any Prince who is\r\ndestined to reign over the destinies of an infinitely varied and\r\nscattered people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSerious Illness of the Prince\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing his return from foreign travel and the fulfilment of a brief\r\nround of public functions and duties came the now historic and really\r\neventful illness of the Prince of Wales. It was a critical period in his\r\ncareer. Boyhood, youth and the first flush of manhood were gone; his\r\nmarriage had taken place and his family been born into a position of\r\npresent and future importance; his own training in public duties and\r\nexperience in foreign travel and observation had been completed up to a\r\nvery high point of efficiency. The one element which seemed to be a\r\nlittle lacking was that of a full appreciation of his own responsibility\r\nto the nation and the Empire. The brilliant light which blazed around\r\nthe Throne could find no fault in the actual performance of any duty;\r\nbut the critical eye and caustic pen had been prone for some years to\r\nallege an overfondness for pleasure and amusement and the pursuits of\r\nsocial life.\r\n\r\nWhether true or false in its not very serious origin this impression had\r\nbeen studiously cultivated in certain quarters at home which had an\r\ninterest in the theoretical flash-lights of republicanism; and\r\nextensively propagated abroad by cabled falsehoods and magnified\r\nincidents until actual harm had been done to the reputation and\r\ncharacter of the young Prince amongst those who did not know him and\r\ncould never actually expect to know him except through the journalistic\r\nfood upon which they were fed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the English people had hardly learned to appreciate\r\nthe important place filled by the Prince of Wales in the community, in\r\nthe daily life of the nation, in the hopes of his future subjects, and\r\ndeep down in the hearts of the masses. Something was apparently needed\r\nto develop those two lines of feeling--one personal and the other\r\nnational--and this came in the illness which struck down the Prince in\r\nthe closing months of 1871. During the Autumn he had paid a visit to\r\nLord Londesborough at Scarborough, and, although not feeling well,\r\nnothing was supposed to be seriously wrong. From there the Prince had\r\ngone to stay with Lord Carington at Gayhurst and thence returned to\r\nSandringham where he became decidedly ill. The _Times_ of November 22nd\r\nwas compelled to state that His Royal Highness was suffering from \"a\r\nchill resulting in a febrile attack\" which had confined him to his room.\r\nOn the following day a bulletin signed by Doctors Jenner, Clayton, Gull\r\nand Lowe stated that the Prince was suffering from typhoid.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE ILLNESS\r\n\r\nAmid the anxiety caused by this announcement every one wondered where\r\nthe disease had been contracted, and ere long it was known that all the\r\nguests of Lord Londesborough at the time of the Royal visit had become\r\nmore or less indisposed; that the hostess herself was seriously ill;\r\nthat the Earl of Chesterfield, one of the recent guests, was down with\r\ntyphoid and, finally that Blegg, the Prince's groom, had caught the same\r\ndisease. Ultimately both peer and peasant died, and the seriousness of\r\ntheir illness as it developed in the public eye added to the gradually\r\ngrowing excitement over the condition of the Heir-Apparent.\r\n\r\nThe growth of popular feeling in the matter was evidently deep and\r\nserious. Bulletins stating that the symptoms of the fever were severe\r\nbut regular continued for a time amid ever-increasing manifestations of\r\ninterest and, as the weeks passed slowly by and the Queen had gone to\r\nthe bedside of her son and something of the devotion of his wife to the\r\nsick Prince became known, this feeling grew in volume. Meanwhile the\r\nPrincess Alice had also come to lend her brother the sympathetic touch\r\nand knowledge of nursing for which she was so well known. For a brief\r\nmoment on December 1st, the patient roused from his delirium\r\nsufficiently to remark that it was the birthday of the Princess, and for\r\na week thereafter the news of improvement in his condition was good.\r\nThen came a crisis when the fever had spent itself while the patient had\r\nalso become worn out. It was impossible to say whether he could live\r\nanother day. The Royal family were summoned to Sandringham on December\r\n9th, and on the following day (Sunday) prayers were offered up in all\r\nthe churches of the land and in many other countries, by request of the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury. In the morning, the Vicar at Sandringham\r\nChurch received a note from the Princess of Wales: \"My husband being,\r\nthank God, somewhat better, I am coming to church, I must leave, I fear,\r\nbefore the service is concluded that I may watch by his bedside. Can you\r\nsay a few words in prayer in the early part of the service, that I may\r\njoin with you in prayer for my husband before I return to him?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS AND THE RECOVERY\r\n\r\nOn December 11th the _Times_ stated that \"the Prince still lives, and we\r\nmay, therefore, still hope.\" During the following days crowds in every\r\ntown surrounded the bulletins and waited in the streets for the latest\r\nnewspaper reports; and the Government found it necessary to forward\r\nmedical statements to every telegraph office in the United Kingdom as\r\nthey were issued. On the 14th of the month a favourable change seemed\r\napparent, and on the 16th the Prince had a quiet and refreshing sleep.\r\nOn the following day the Royal family went to church, where, by special\r\nrequest, the Royal patient and his dying groom--Blegg--were prayed for\r\ntogether. The latter died within a few hours, but not before the\r\nPrincess had found time to visit him and comfort his relations. Slowly,\r\nbut steadily, from that time on the Prince began to make headway towards\r\nrecovery, though it was not until Christmas Day that the danger was\r\nthought to be past and his Royal mother could express her feeling to the\r\nnation in a letter which was made public on December 26th: \"The Queen is\r\nvery anxious to express her deep sense of the touching sympathy of the\r\nwhole nation on the occasion of the alarming illness of her dear son,\r\nthe Prince of Wales. The universal feeling shown by her people during\r\nthese painful, terrible days, and the sympathy evinced by them with\r\nherself and her beloved daughter, the Princess of Wales, as well as the\r\ngeneral joy at the improvement of the Prince of Wales's state, have made\r\na deep and lasting impression on her heart which can never be effaced.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCELEBRATION OF HIS RECOVERY\r\n\r\nThe recovery of the Prince took the usual course of the disease and was\r\nprotracted in character; but on January 14th the last bulletin was\r\nissued. The Princess of Wales and the Princess Alice had been his nurses\r\nthroughout this trying time, and they had never seemed to weary in their\r\ndevoted care. Nine days after the issue of the last bulletin Dr. William\r\nJenner was gazetted a K.C.B. and Dr. William W. Gull a baronet. There\r\nwere rumors at this time that the patient had been at one stage actually\r\n_in extremis_, but had been saved by one of those sudden inspirations\r\nwhich sometimes constitute so important a part of medical practice, and\r\nwhich consisted in a vigorous and continuous application of old\r\nchampagne brandy over the body until returning animation had rewarded\r\nthe doctor's efforts. The 14th of December, the anniversary of the\r\nPrince Consort's death and the day upon which the actual turning point\r\nin the disease took place, was commemorated by a brass lectern in the\r\nParish Church of Sandringham, which bears the following inscription:\r\n\r\n    To the Glory of God.\r\n    A Thank-Offering for His Mercies.\r\n    14th December, 1871.\r\n    Alexandra.\r\n\r\n    \"When I was in trouble I called upon the Lord, and He heard me.\"\r\n\r\nThe good news from Sandringham was received throughout the country with\r\nexpressions of the most unbounded popular satisfaction; and the\r\nannouncement that an opportunity would be afforded of returning public\r\nthanks to the Almighty for his mercy was universally approved. The day\r\nfor the National Thanksgiving was finally settled for February 27th, and\r\nSt. Paul's Cathedral as the place; but before that time came Dr.\r\nStanley--who had now become Dean of Westminster--suggested a private\r\nvisit to the Abbey and a personal expression of his feelings by the\r\nPrince. This was done in absolute privacy, with only the Princess and a\r\nfew members of the Royal family present. A sermon was preached by the\r\nDean in which, as he told an intimate friend, he was able for once to\r\nsay what he wished to say.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATION UNITED IN A COMMON SYMPATHY\r\n\r\nMany of the papers of the country commented upon the event with much the\r\nsame freedom as the Dean was able to use on this occasion, and it seemed\r\nto be felt that the unbounded solicitude and affection so evidently and\r\nprofoundly shown for the Prince had given a certain right of counsel to\r\nthe nation. It was generally admitted that the illness had disclosed to\r\nthe people as a whole something like an adequate knowledge of their own\r\nconvictions in connection with the monarchy and concerning its\r\nmaintenance as a permanent and powerful institution of the realm.\r\nWhatever might be the abstract ideas held by individuals in times when\r\nMr. Bradlaugh and Sir Charles Dilke were preaching republicanism and Mr.\r\nChamberlain was suspected of harbouring the same opinions, it had become\r\napparent that the subjects of the Queen in Great Britain were\r\npractically a unit in their preference for a constitutional monarchy and\r\nin their personal devotion to the Crown and the Royal family. In\r\naddition to the event having awakened the nation to the strength of its\r\nown sentiment in this regard, it was also believed that an important\r\ninfluence would be found to have been exerted upon the Prince of\r\nWales--a steadying sense of responsibility resulting from holding such a\r\nplace as he did in the hearts of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC THANKSGIVING OF THE NATION\r\n\r\nThe _Illustrated London News_ well embodied this thought in the\r\nfollowing comment: \"Doubtless what has occurred during the last few\r\nweeks has also a meaning for the Heir Apparent to the Throne. No man of\r\nthe slightest sensibility can witness the emotional effusion of a great\r\nnation towards himself without being deeply impressed with the\r\nresponsibilities of his position. The Prince comes back to the British\r\npeople from the brink of the tomb, and they who most pathetically\r\nlamented his danger hail his return to health with devout thanksgivings\r\nand acclamations of joy. Can there be a more powerful incentive to that\r\ncourse of future action which will commend him to their approbation and\r\ntheir love? That he will recognize and respond to it, we cannot allow\r\nourselves to doubt.\" One of the interesting incidents of the illness was\r\nthe fact that when the announcement was made that His Royal Highness\r\nmight only survive a few hours his obituary was, of course, prepared and\r\nput in type in all the leading newspaper offices in the land to an\r\nextent varying from the pages of a metropolitan daily down to the half\r\ndozen columns of the Provincial press. Proofs of the obituaries were, it\r\nis understood, afterwards collected and sent to the Prince, who had\r\nthem pasted into an immense scrap-book at Marlborough House.\r\n\r\nThe Thanksgiving Day celebration commenced on February 27th at 12\r\no'clock, when Her Majesty the Queen, accompanied by the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales and the Princess Beatrice and Prince Albert Victor of\r\nWales, drove through the gates of Buckingham Palace. There were nine\r\nRoyal carriages in the procession, containing a number of ladies and\r\ngentlemen of the Court, and the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Arthur, Prince\r\nLeopold and Prince George of Wales. With the latter was the Marquess of\r\nAylesbury, Master of the Horse; Mr. Brand, Speaker of the House of\r\nCommons; Lord Hatherley, the Lord Chancellor. H. R. H. the Duke of\r\nCambridge, Commander-in-Chief, headed the procession as it passed slowly\r\nthrough Pall Mall, Charing Cross, the Strand, Fleet Street and Ludgate\r\nHill to St. Paul's Cathedral. The streets were lined with dense masses\r\nof people, while every shop-window, doorstep, portico and available roof\r\nwere black with cheering throngs. Decorations there were of every sort\r\nand range--squalid or simple or splendid--but all representing pleasure\r\nand loyalty. Along Fleet Street and the Strand they took the form of an\r\nactual canopy of banners, standards, streamers and strings of flowers.\r\nVenetian masts, flying pennons, countless trophies and miniature\r\nshields, with varied mottoes and many kinds of loyal wishes, were seen\r\nall along the route. A band of school children numbering 30,000 sang the\r\nNational Anthem in Green Park, while soldiers lined the roadway from the\r\nPalace to the Cathedral. Hearty and enthusiastic cheers greeted the\r\nRoyal party, and the Queen and Princess were described as looking bright\r\nand happy, and the Prince as being pale, but not thin. The Queen wore a\r\nblack velvet dress trimmed with white ermine, the Princess of Wales was\r\nin blue silk covered with black lace, and the Prince was in the uniform\r\nof a British General and wearing the orders of the Garter and the Bath.\r\n\r\nAt Temple Bar the Queen was formally received by the Lord Mayor and\r\nSheriffs of London, and the city sword handed to Her Majesty and\r\nreturned in the usual way. At one o'clock the Royal party arrived at the\r\nCathedral and passed up a covered way of crimson cloth to the steps,\r\nwhere they were received by the Bishop of London, the Dean and Chapter\r\nof St. Paul's and the officers of Her Majesty's Household. The vast\r\ninterior of the building had been arranged to accommodate 13,000\r\npersons, and was crowded to the doors. Space under the dome was reserved\r\nfor the Queen, the Royal family, the House of Lords, the House of\r\nCommons, the Corps Diplomatique and the distinguished foreigners, the\r\nJudges and the dignitaries of the law, the Lords Lieutenant and Sheriffs\r\nof Counties, the representatives of universities and other learned\r\nbodies. The choir was reserved for the Clergy, and the place assigned to\r\nHer Majesty and their Royal Highnesses was slightly raised, made into a\r\nkind of pew and covered with crimson cloth.\r\n\r\nThe Royal procession as it moved up the aisle included, besides the\r\nmembers of the Royal family, such well known officials and members of\r\nthe Court as Major-General Lord Alfred Paget, Lieutenant-General Sir\r\nJohn Cowell, Colonel H. F. Ponsonby, Major-General Sir T. M. Biddulph,\r\nGeneral Sir William Knollys, Rear-Admiral Lord Frederick Kerr, the\r\n(late) Lord Methuen, General Lord Strathnairn, the Marquess of\r\nAylesbury, the Viscount Sydney, the Countess of Gainsborough, the Lady\r\nChurchill, Lady Caroline Barrington, the Hon. Mrs. Grey, the Countess of\r\nMorton and Lord Harris. Most of the great names and great personages of\r\nEngland were present at this function. There were 200 Peers and\r\nPeeresses; the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and fourteen Bishops;\r\nnearly every member of the House of Commons. Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone\r\nwere there as were Mr. Disraeli and Viscountess Beaconsfield. Lord\r\nNorthbrook, Mr. W. E. Forster, Mr. Cardwell, Mr. Chichester Fortescue,\r\nMr. Goschen, and Lord Granville were visible. Throngs of ladies,\r\nbrilliant in blue and mauve and crimson satin and gems were present,\r\nand, as the sun suddenly shone through what had been sullen clouds, the\r\nspectacle within those parts of the Cathedral touched by the stream of\r\nlight was beautiful indeed. It shone upon the bright blue of many\r\ndresses--the Royal colour of the day--mixed up in a confusion of\r\neffective shadings with the dark blue and burnished gold of the\r\nuniforms, the scarlet and white plumes of the officers, the gorgeous\r\nrobes of the Peers, the white lawn of the Bishops.\r\n\r\nAfter walking up the aisle on the arm of the Prince of Wales, with the\r\nPrincess on the other side, Her Majesty took her place in the special\r\npew with the chief members of the Royal family on either side. After a\r\nbrief special service of thanksgiving the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\npreached the sermon for the occasion in words of tact and eloquence from\r\nwhich one quotation may be made: \"Just as in one of our own homes when\r\ndeath threatens, the whole history of the loved object we fear to lose\r\ncomes back in the hours of waiting, so England was stirred by a hundred\r\ntouching memories when danger threatened the Royal house. And God\r\ndoubtless thus touched our hearts to deepen our loyalty and make us\r\nbetter prize the thousand good things secured in a well-ordered State by\r\nlove to the head of the State.\" At the conclusion of the sermon a\r\nThanksgiving Hymn was sung and the benediction given. The following was\r\nthe concluding verse:\r\n\r\n    \"Bless, Father, him thou gavest\r\n    Back to the loyal land,\r\n    O Saviour, him Thou savest,\r\n    Still cover with Thine Hand:\r\n\r\n    O Spirit, the Defender,\r\n    Be his to guard and guide,\r\n    Now in life's midday splendor\r\n    On to the eventide.\"\r\n\r\nThe Royal party then proceeded in due state to their carriages and the\r\nprocession returned through the streets of the city to Buckingham Palace\r\nover the Holborn Viaduct, along Holborn and Oxford street to the Marble\r\nArch, _via_ Hyde Park to Piccadilly, and thence down Constitution Hill.\r\nEnthusiastic cheering was heard all along the route and decorations were\r\nseen everywhere in the greatest abundance. In the evening London was\r\nbrilliant with light. The dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, the Mansion\r\nHouse, and the two large triumphal arches were particularly bright and\r\nbeautiful in their varied colours and illuminations. The Lord Mayor and\r\nLady Mayoress entertained the Lord Mayor of Dublin and the Provincial\r\nMayors to a banquet at the Mansion House and, all over the United\r\nKingdom, celebrations of a popular or religious character, holiday\r\ngatherings, crowded meetings and illuminations, marked the day and the\r\npleasure of the people. Addresses poured in by hundreds and rejoicings\r\nwere not confined to the Island portion of the Empire. An incident of\r\nthis celebration was the collection of a Thanksgiving Fund for the\r\ncompletion of St. Paul's Cathedral. To it the Queen gave £1000 and the\r\nPrince of Wales £500. Another feature of the event was the splendid\r\nbehaviour of the millions of people who lined the seven-mile route of\r\nthe procession and paid loyal tribute to their Queen and to the son who\r\nwas heir to all the traditions of his race and the greatness of the\r\nRoyal name. On February 29th Her Majesty wrote to Mr. Gladstone a\r\nmessage intended for the nation:\r\n\r\n     \"The Queen is anxious, as on a previous occasion, to express\r\n     publicly her own personal very deep sense of the reception she and\r\n     her dear children met with on Tuesday, February the 27th, from\r\n     millions of her subjects on her way to and from St. Paul's. Words\r\n     are too weak for the Queen to say how very deeply touched and\r\n     gratified she has been by the immense enthusiasm and affection\r\n     exhibited towards her dear son and herself, from the highest down\r\n     to the lowest, on the long progress through the Capital, and she\r\n     would earnestly wish to convey her warmest and most heartfelt\r\n     thanks to the whole nation for this great demonstration of loyalty.\r\n     The Queen, as well as her son and dear daughter-in-law, felt that\r\n     the whole nation joined with them in thanking God for sparing the\r\n     beloved Prince of Wales's life.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most beautiful and effective presentations of popular\r\nfeeling and hopes in connection with this now historic sickness of the\r\nHeir Apparent were the sermons preached by Dean Stanley. No one has ever\r\nbeen closer in friendship and in personal knowledge to the Prince of\r\nWales than had this eloquent and saintly ecclesiastic. No one has been\r\nmore admired and respected in the Church of England in modern days than\r\nhe; nor has any of its clergy possessed a wider view or more generous\r\nheart. Speaking in Westminster Abbey on December 10th, 1871, when the\r\nnation was awaiting in deep anxiety the issue of a struggle which seemed\r\nto be almost fatally and surely decided, he embodied the popular feeling\r\nin beautiful and appropriate words: \"On a day like this when there is\r\none topic in every household, one question on every lip, it is\r\nimpossible to stand in this place and not endeavour to give some\r\nexpression to that of which every heart is full. We all press, as it\r\nwere, round one darkened chamber, we all feel that with the mourning\r\nfamily, mother, wife, brothers, sisters, who are there assembled, we are\r\nindeed one. The thrill of their fears or hopes passes through and\r\nthrough the differences of rank and station; we feel that, while they\r\nrepresent the whole people they also represent and are that which each\r\nfamily and each member of each family, is separately. In the fierce\r\nbattle between life and death, for the issues of which we are all\r\nlooking with such eager expectation, we see the likeness of what will\r\nbefall every individual soul amongst us; and the reflection which this\r\nstruggle, with all its manifold uncertainties suggests, concerns us all\r\nalike.\"\r\n\r\nThe sermon which followed was a skillful presentation of thoughts\r\nsuggested by the text, \"To live is Christ and to die is gain.\" It\r\nconcluded with an earnest hope that the Royal life which might so\r\ngreatly influence the national destinies might still be preserved--\"a\r\nlife which, if duly appreciated and fitly used, contains within it\r\nspecial opportunities for good such as no other existence in this great\r\ncommunity possesses; a life which may, if worthily employed, stimulate\r\nall that is noble and beneficent and discourage all that is low and base\r\nand frivolous.\" In these and other words he concluded a sermon which\r\ncould not but have had its influence in after days upon the life and\r\ncharacter of the Prince who so greatly respected and regarded the\r\npreacher. A week later the cloud had lifted from Sandringham and the\r\nlife which had been so much prayed for in so many lands was slowly\r\npassing into the region of safety and strength. It gave the opportunity\r\nto Dean Stanley to speak again at the historic Abbey in a strain of\r\ninstruction and to draw a national moral from the events of the past few\r\nmonths. He referred to the spontaneous outburst of every class and every\r\nparty which had, to his mind, proved the permanent supremacy of the\r\nBritish Crown in a Christian State. \"There are nations and there have\r\nbeen times in which the devotion to the reigning family has been a thing\r\nseparate and apart from the love of country. There have been times and\r\nplaces when the love of country has existed with no loyal feeling to the\r\nreigning family. Let us thank God that in England it is not so. Loyalty\r\nwith us is the personal, romantic side of patriotism. Patriotism with us\r\nis the Christian, philosophic side of loyalty. Long may the two flourish\r\ntogether, each supporting and sustaining the other.\"\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday following the Thanksgiving Service at St. Paul's--March\r\n3rd--the Dean preached for the last time upon this subject in\r\nWestminster Abbey. After stirring references to the wonderful scene of\r\nnational enthusiasm lately witnessed and to the gathering in St. Paul's\r\nCathedral of representatives of every creed and religious division in\r\nGreat Britain (except those of one exclusive body) to offer\r\nthanksgivings in \"the venerable forms of the National Church\" he\r\nexpressed his belief that the demonstration as a whole was \"the response\r\nin every English heart to the sense of union--too subtle for analysis\r\nyet true and simple as the primitive instincts of our race--which binds\r\nthe people of England to their Monarchy and the Monarchy to the people.\"\r\nHe dealt with the functions and character of that institution in most\r\nstriking words. \"No other existing throne in Europe reaches back to the\r\nsame antiquity, none other combines with such an undivided charm the\r\nassociations of the past with the interests of the present. It is the\r\none name and place which, being beyond the reach of personal ambition,\r\nbeyond the need of private gain, has the inestimable chance of guiding,\r\nmoulding, elevating the tastes, the customs, the morals of the whole\r\ncommunity. It is the one name and place which, being raised high above\r\nall party struggles, all local jealousies, over all classes,\r\necclesiastical as well as civil, is the supreme controlling spring which\r\nbinds together in their widest meaning all the forces of the State and\r\nall the forces of the Church. It is the one institution which by very\r\nnature of its existence unites the abstract idea of country and of duty\r\nwith the personal endearments of family life, of domestic love, of\r\nindividual character.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the greatness of this national possession--one which had steadied\r\nnational progress and promoted peace in the midst of tumults and freedom\r\nin the midst of disorder--which had, Dean Stanley thought, helped to\r\nmake the people pray that its destined heir should be worthy of his\r\nnoble inheritance. And then the speaker pointedly and clearly pictured\r\nthe increased and increasing responsibilities of the Prince of Wales\r\nupon whom, henceforth, \"as by a new consecration and confirmation,\r\ndevolves the glorious task of devoting to his country's service that\r\nlife which is in a special sense no longer his but ours, for which his\r\ncountry's prayers, his country's thanksgivings, have been so earnestly\r\noffered.\" The sermon concluded with a description of these great\r\nresponsibilities; an appeal to the Prince to begin life afresh and to\r\ntake the lead in all that was true and holy, just and good; a warning\r\nthat \"of him to whom much has been given, much shall be required;\" a\r\npicture of a Christian England fighting evil in every form and in every\r\nplace and growing greater in all the elements of higher national and\r\nindividual life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales in India\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a Royal tour of the vast British possessions in Hindostan was an\r\ninspiring idea. To constitute the Crown a tangible evidence of Imperial\r\npower and a living object and centre of Eastern loyalty and respect was\r\na policy worthy of Mr. Disraeli and of the statecraft in which he had\r\nonce declared imagination to be an essential ingredient. To precede this\r\naction by the purchase of the Suez Canal shares in order to safe-guard\r\nthe pathway to the Indian Empire and to succeed it with such an\r\nimpressive appeal to Oriental individualism and personal loyalty as the\r\nproclamation of Queen Victoria as Empress of India were strokes of\r\nstatesmanship such as no other Englishman of that time was capable of\r\ninitiating.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCEPTION OF THE PROJECT\r\n\r\nIn Bombay, when the project was finally in full fruition, the Prince of\r\nWales told a distinguished audience that \"it had long been the dream of\r\nhis life to visit India,\" and there seems no room to doubt that it was a\r\npart of the original plan mapped out by the keen perceptions of the\r\nPrince Consort for the education of his eldest son. It was\r\nunquestionably suggested to the former by Lord Canning, when\r\nGovernor-General of India in the wild days of the Mutiny, but the idea\r\nnecessarily slumbered until the young Prince was old enough to undertake\r\nthe heavy duties involved.\r\n\r\nBy that time his father had passed away; the old-time rule of the East\r\nIndia Company was gone; a new and greater India had expanded in\r\nterritory and population; while the loyalty of its native Princes had\r\nbecome a constant marvel to other peoples. Yet there were causes of\r\ndiscontent and grounds for trouble. The myriad masses of Hindostan did\r\nnot yet fully understand who was ruling over them, nor had they ever\r\nfully comprehended how the rule of the Company passed away. The word\r\n\"Queen\" had to them an Eastern significance which did not exactly compel\r\nrespect, and that personal side of Government which means so much to the\r\nOriental mind had never been brought home to them. The assassination of\r\nLord Mayo proved the possibilities of greater trouble, and there was\r\nalways the danger of Russian aggression and the existence of border\r\nwarfare. In the winter of 1874, therefore, the question of a Royal tour\r\nwas seriously considered, and some correspondence passed between the\r\nauthorities concerned. To send the Heir to the Throne on such a visit\r\nwas a unique project, and there were various difficulties to overcome.\r\nIndia was accustomed to visitors of the type of Alexander the Great, of\r\nTimour, Baber, Mahmoud of Ghuznee and Nadir Shah; but a peaceful\r\nprogress of the foreign Heir to its Throne was another matter. Brief and\r\nhasty visits to some of its Princes had been made in recent times by\r\nPrince Adalbert of Prussia, the King of the Belgians and the Duke of\r\nEdinburgh, but there had never been a state tour of the country with all\r\nits accompaniments of splendour and costliness, the danger from fanatics\r\nand the trying changes of climatic conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENTS FOR THE TOUR\r\n\r\nIt was not an easy matter to arrange, and the probabilities are, that if\r\nthe Prince of Wales had not himself insisted that it was his duty to go,\r\nthe project might ultimately have been abandoned. He had by this time\r\ncome to fill so important a place in the public eye and in the external\r\nfunctions of Sovereignty that his absence for six months, or more was a\r\nserious consideration. The preliminary obstacles, however, were\r\novercome, and on the 16th of March, 1875, the Marquess of Salisbury,\r\nSecretary of State for India, announced that the visit would take place,\r\nand a little later the _Times_ stated that Sir Bartle Frere would\r\naccompany His Royal Highness. The former was widely known in India\r\nthrough administrative duties admirably performed in Bombay and the\r\nNorth-West Provinces. The Duke of Sutherland, a much respected nobleman,\r\nwas selected as one of the suite, together with Lord Suffield, head of\r\nthe Prince's Household; Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Ellis, Equerry to the\r\nPrince, and who had served in India; Major-General (Sir) D. M. Probyn,\r\nV.C., who arranged the details regarding horses, transport and sporting;\r\nMr. Knollys, who has since been so well known as Sir Francis Knollys,\r\nthe Prince's Private Secretary; Lord Alfred Paget, an old man and most\r\nattached friend to the Prince; the Rev. Canon Duckworth, who went as\r\nChaplain; and Dr. Fayrer, who attended in the capacity of guardian to\r\nthe Prince's health, and afterwards became a well known physician and\r\nSir Joseph Fayrer, Bart., F.R.S., etc.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Aylesford, Lord Carington and Colonel Owen Williams were\r\ninvited, as personal friends of the Prince of Wales, to join the party,\r\nwhile Lieutenant the Lord Charles Beresford, M.P., who had accompanied\r\nthe Duke of Edinburgh on his preceding hasty visit, also lent his\r\nexperience and unflagging gayety to the suite, and was aided by\r\nLieutenant Augustus Fitz-George of the Rifle Brigade. Mr. Sydney Hall\r\nwas the official artist of the tour; Mr. Albert Grey (afterwards Earl\r\nGrey) was Private Secretary to Sir Bartle Frere; and the present Sir\r\nWilliam Howard Russell was a special correspondent with the nominal\r\nduties of Honorary Private Secretary to the Prince. When Parliament met\r\nvarious questions were asked as to whether the expenses of the tour were\r\nto be charged to the British or Indian Governments; whether the Prince\r\nwould represent the Queen; whether he would supersede the\r\nGovernor-General for the time being, etc. On July 8th Mr. Disraeli made\r\na full statement for the first time in connection with the subject. He\r\nalluded to the previous travels of the Prince of Wales and expressed the\r\nopinion that they were the best form of education for a Royal personage.\r\nBut the rules and regulations and etiquette which sufficed for the\r\nPrince in Canada and other countries would not do in India. One\r\nimportant difference was the probably costly character of the ceremonial\r\npresents which would have to be exchanged between the visitor and his\r\nhosts amongst the native Princes. Money would have to be granted for\r\nthis, and the sum of £30,000 had been casually estimated for the\r\npurpose. The estimate of the Admiralty for the expenses of the voyage\r\nand corresponding movements of the fleet was £52,000. He would ask for a\r\nvote of £60,000. The Prince would go as the Heir Apparent to the Crown\r\nand be the formal guest of the Viceroy from the time of setting foot\r\nupon Indian soil. The expenses of the tour were to be charged to the\r\nIndian Budget. This statement created some criticism, while the very\r\nsmall amount proposed for expenditure caused still more comment. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the Prince did not exceed, in the end, the comparatively\r\nsmall amount voted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNEY COMMENCED\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, October 10th, a farewell sermon was preached at Westminster\r\nAbbey by Dean Stanley, who expressed the hope that the visit might leave\r\nbehind it \"on one side the remembrance of graceful acts, kind words,\r\nEnglish nobleness, Christian principles, and on the other awaken in all\r\nconcerned the sense of graver duties, wider sympathies, loftier\r\npurposes.\" On the following day the Prince left London amid marked\r\npopular demonstrations of respect and regard, and with every evidence of\r\na deep public interest shown by the press of the country. At Dover\r\nthousands of people cheered the Prince farewell. He took the boat for\r\nCalais, accompanied by the Princess, who, however, did not land, but\r\nreturned home next morning. At Paris he was accidentally met by\r\nPresident MacMahon, who was leaving on the train for another place, and\r\nwelcomed to France; officially he was received by Lord Lyons, the\r\nBritish Ambassador. On the following day His Royal Highness lunched with\r\nMarshal MacMahon at the Elysée. This visit and the ensuing journey\r\nthrough Turin, Bologna and Ancona to Brindisi was carried out in a\r\nprivate and non-official capacity. Nevertheless, at every station there\r\nwere officials, guards of honour and crowds of people to see the special\r\ngo through and to do honour to the traveller. The bulk of the Royal\r\nsuite followed the Prince a little later, and on October 16th the whole\r\nparty met at Brindisi and the voyage proper commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\nWELCOMED BY THE KING OF THE GREEKS\r\n\r\nLater in the same day H. M. S. _Serapis_, under the command of Captain\r\nthe Hon. H. Carr-Glyn, accompanied by the Royal yacht _Osborne_, left\r\nBrindisi, and two days later the Prince was being welcomed in Athens by\r\nthe King of the Hellenes--Otto I--and by a picturesque Court clad in the\r\nattractive costumes of the nation. Visits to the Acropolis and to the\r\ncountry house of the King were followed by a State banquet at the\r\nPalace, which gathered together all that was eminent in modern Grecian\r\nlife, glittering with laces, orders and decorations, and including some\r\nyoung men who have since become famous--Tricoupi, Delyannis,\r\nCommoundourus and Zaimés. Illuminations of the city ensued, and in the\r\nmorning, after a Royal reception, the Prince left Athens through crowds\r\nof people, who seemed a little more demonstrative than had been the case\r\nat first. On October 20th the Piræus was left behind after a farewell\r\nvisit from the King and at dawn the next day Crete was in sight. The\r\nship steered steadily ahead and three days later was welcomed at Port\r\nSaid by Egyptian frigates on sea and Egyptian infantry on shore.\r\n\r\nThere was no cheering from the people but much curiosity. A formal\r\nwelcome was offered for the Khedive by Princes Tewfik, Hussein and\r\nHassan, who were accompanied on their visit to the _Serapis_ by the\r\nwell-known statesman Nubar Pasha, and other officers of the Court. The\r\nPrince then transferred himself to a smaller vessel--the _Osborne_--and\r\nwith a Royal Standard floating over the ship for the first time since\r\nthe Empress Eugénie had opened the Suez Canal, he traversed that famous\r\nwaterway. At Ismaila, the Prince and his suite landed and took a special\r\ntrain to Cairo, where His Royal Highness was welcomed by the Khedive in\r\nperson, with the towering form of the Grand Duke Alexis of Russia\r\nstanding behind, and a brilliantly uniformed Court around him. To the\r\nPrince of Wales the Gezireh Palace was given as his temporary residence.\r\nThe succeeding day was occupied with ceremonials of various kinds, a\r\nbanquet being given by the Khedive at the Abdeen Palace in the evening,\r\nwhen the Prince passed to and fro in a lane of light made by myriad\r\nmany-coloured lamps.\r\n\r\nOn October 25th, the Prince of Wales invested Prince Tewfik--afterwards\r\nKhedive of Egypt--with the Order of the Star of India amidst all\r\npossible state. In a letter he told His Highness that the honour was\r\nconferred to mark British appreciation of the Khedive's friendship to\r\nEngland, and his good work in promoting the safety of British\r\ncommunication with India. The next day saw the Royal departure from\r\nCairo after a formal visit from the Khedive, the Princes his sons, and\r\nhis Ministers, who were again at the station to see him off a little\r\nlater. Suez was reached in the evening and, amid elaborate preparations\r\nfrom the Pasha of that place, crowds of people and illuminated\r\nmen-of-war in the roadstead, the Prince and his party boarded the\r\n_Serapis_ and, accompanied by the _Osborne_, proceeded on the voyage to\r\nAden. Perim, which has been described as \"a gigantic blistered clinker,\"\r\nwas reached and passed on October 31st, and from the ship the Prince got\r\nhis first view of Her Majesty's Indian troops. It is to be hoped that\r\nthe cheering Bombay Infantry drawn up on that vitrified surface, got a\r\nfair view of the Prince in return. On the following day the\r\nvolcanic-like Island of Aden was reached, and its fortifications gazed\r\nupon with interest. As the flag flew from the mast-head of the _Serapis_\r\nto announce its arrival the ships and crags rang with the roar of\r\ncannon. The Prince landed, clad in uniform of a somewhat mixed\r\ncharacter, with Field Marshal's insignia, and accompanied by his suite.\r\nUpon, or around, the platform and triumphal arch erected at the\r\nlanding-place, was every variety of picturesque oriental costume with a\r\nbackground of mountain and blistered rock and white, painted houses.\r\nChiefs from the mainland in gorgeous array, the King's Own Borderer's\r\nRegiment, all the ladies of the island in European or Asiatic costume,\r\nfierce-looking Arabs, meek-looking Hindoos, sleek Parsees, people from\r\nall the regions between the Persian Gulf, Zanzibar and Arabia, were\r\nthere to welcome him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE RECEIVES AN ADDRESS\r\n\r\nA formal address was presented to His Royal Highness by the Resident--a\r\nParsee--and then followed a drive through decorated streets with\r\nnumerous arches and curious mottoes to the Residency. A Levée was held\r\nhere and later in the day the ship was again boarded and steamed away\r\nfrom the Indian Gibraltar as it lay bathed in lines of light along all\r\nits town and batteries.\r\n\r\nBombay was reached on November 8th, after a voyage which was upon the\r\nwhole pleasant--certainly as far as surroundings and comforts could\r\nmake it. For a few hours official visitors streamed on board, and then\r\nin the afternoon Lord Northbrook, Viceroy of India, appeared on the\r\nscene and was received with the honours due to his station. There had\r\nbeen some idea abroad that difficulties might arise as to the respective\r\npositions of the Heir Apparent and the Viceroy in State ceremonial, but\r\nfrom the day of this first formal meeting there does not seem to have\r\nbeen the slightest trouble upon the point. Each knew perfectly what\r\npertained to the position and rank of the other. Then came the Governor\r\nof Bombay, Sir Philip Wodehouse, and with him the Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Presidency, Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Staveley, and the members\r\nof the Council. Meanwhile the harbour was filled with ships and boats of\r\nall kinds, flags were streaming everywhere, in the distance was a vast\r\ntriumphal arch spanning the waterway between two piers, and, as the\r\nRoyal and Vice-regal party stepped into the barge and started for the\r\nlanding-place, the cannon roared, bands played, guards saluted and crews\r\ncheered.\r\n\r\nAs the Prince of Wales landed the scene was one of the most splendid\r\nconceivable. Long lines of seats draped in scarlet cloth stood out under\r\nthe sides of the gigantic archway and upon them stood a multitude of\r\nnative notabilities--Chiefs, Sirdars and gentlemen, Parsees, Hindoos,\r\nMahrattas and Mohammedans--a crowd glittering in gems and bright in all\r\nthe brilliant hues of Oriental garb. Amongst them also were the officers\r\nof the Government and Municipality, leading citizens and dignitaries,\r\nand all the ladies who could be found within a radius of a hundred\r\nmiles. Flowers and shrubs and banners and flags were everywhere. An\r\naddress expressive of loyalty and pride in the British Throne was\r\npresented from the Municipality and duly answered, and then the Prince,\r\nwith Lord Northbrook at his side, walked along a carpeted avenue,\r\nspeaking to various Princes and Chiefs as they were presented--the\r\nfirst being Sir Salar Jung, the Prime Minister and representative and\r\nfamous statesman of Hyderabad. At the end of the avenue, where carriages\r\nwere taken for the procession of seven miles through the teeming streets\r\nof the city, a band of Parsee girls in white were waiting to strew\r\ngarlands and flowers in the Prince's carriage and on the roadway.\r\n\r\nThere was no music in this wonderful night procession and its\r\nsurroundings are difficult to describe. Mr. W. H. Russell, the diarist\r\nof the Royal tour, speaks of the spectacle as being absolutely baffling\r\nto the eye. \"There was something almost supernatural in these long\r\nvistas winding down banks of variegated light, crowded with gigantic\r\ncreatures waving their arms aloft and indulging in extravagant gesture,\r\nwhich the eye--baffled by rivers of fire, blinded with the glare of\r\nlamps and blazing magnesium wire and pots of burning matter--sought in\r\nvain to penetrate.\" The piled-up masses of human beings along these\r\nmiles of streets; the Parsee women in brilliant costumes, which vied\r\nwith the colours of the surrounding fires and lights; crowds of\r\nMohammedans; Hindoo temples with roofs covered by Brahmins and their\r\nvotaries; a Jew bazaar, an American store, a European warehouse, or a\r\nJapan temple in close proximity to each other and all bearing a burden\r\nof people in varied dress; flashed a picturesque and never-ending\r\nvariety of sight and colour and character to the gaze of the quiet,\r\ndignified man who drove through it all as the central figure of a\r\nspectacle whose like may never be seen again. A banquet followed in the\r\ngreat hall of Government House, and a state reception closed the varied\r\nproceedings of this first busy day in historic Hindostan.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, camp-fires blazed for miles around the city, the fiery\r\nfurnace of the streets settled into as much of silence as an Oriental\r\ncentre under such conditions could attain and all over India, in every\r\nmart and village and town where a gun could be found, volleys had\r\nannounced the arrival of the heir to its Imperial throne. In the\r\nmorning a Royal reception was held at Government House and, amid\r\nsplendid surroundings and every form of dignity and severe etiquette\r\nnecessary to impress the visiting Princes and Chiefs and Rajahs of the\r\ngreat Presidency of Bombay, His Royal Highness stood or sat for hours in\r\nthe intense heat, clad in a stiff uniform, laden with lace and buttoned\r\nup to the throat. With him were the Duke of Sutherland, Major-General\r\nLord Alfred Paget, Sir Bartle Frere, Lord Suffield, Lord Charles\r\nBeresford and the rest of his suite. The Oriental dignitaries, each in\r\ngreat state, came with attendants and ceremonies and gifts in accordance\r\nwith his rank. Each Prince was treated along graded lines of cordiality,\r\ncourtesy or civility, as was supposed to become his position. The little\r\nRajah of Kolapore; the Maharajah of Mysore; the Maharana of Oodeypore;\r\nthe Rao of Cutch--who left a sick bed and returned home to die; the\r\nlittle Gaekwar of Baroda, who was described as looking like a\r\ncrystallized rainbow and was accompanied by the famous statesman, Sir\r\nMadhava Rao; Sir Salar Jung of Hyderabad; and the Maharajah of Edur;\r\nwere received one after the other and then a succession of less\r\nimportant rulers with tremendous names, fierce-looking guards and more\r\nor less gorgeous costumes.\r\n\r\nAt the end of what was a Durbar in all but name the Prince was only\r\nbeginning his functions for the day. The Viceroy had to be received and\r\nmany matters discussed; a visit was paid to the _Serapis_ where the men\r\nwere celebrating the Prince's birthday, as were many millions throughout\r\nIndia; telegrams were exchanged with the Princess at Sandringham; every\r\nstep was marked by pomp and splendour; a state banquet was held in the\r\nevening and another, but less formal, reception afterwards. Meantime,\r\nthe city, the shipping and the harbour were a blaze of light and general\r\nillumination--the great bay looking as if it were filled with rows of\r\nfiery pyramids and the streets as if all India were trying to pass\r\nthrough them. On November the 10th the Viceroy bade farewell to the\r\nPrince, who did not see him again until near the end of his tour. He\r\nwent on a journey himself to parts of India which His Royal Highness was\r\nunable to visit. Another formal reception of lesser Rajahs and Nawabs\r\ntook place in the morning. In the afternoon the Prince drove into\r\nBombay, accompanied by Sir Philip Wodehouse and held a Levée in the\r\nGovernment Buildings. Then followed a visit to the harbour where, in an\r\nopen space, seven thousand children of all castes, classes, colours and\r\ncreeds, dressed in brilliant hues and laden with flowers, sang patriotic\r\nsongs. They almost smothered the Royal guest in flowers as he ascended\r\nto his place. State visits were then made to a number of the native\r\nPrinces who had been already received and, in the evening, a grand\r\nEuropean ball, given by the Byculla Club, was attended. Other Chiefs\r\nwere visited next day by the Prince--those who had not residences or\r\nwere not of sufficient importance being assigned reception rooms at the\r\nSecretariat, or Government Buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE'S POPULARITY AT BOMBAY\r\n\r\nAfter this wearisome and almost unbearably hot business was over the\r\nPrince attended a dinner given by the people of Bombay to the sailors of\r\nthe fleet and the vigorous cheering of these two thousand seamen as His\r\nRoyal Highness entered the hall must have been a relief after the heavy\r\nand sustained etiquette of the past few days. Following this was the\r\nlaying of the foundation stone of the Elphinstone Docks with Masonic\r\nritual and ceremonies. Then came a visit to the Hyderabad Prime Minister\r\nand deputation and to others and a busy day closed with the usual state\r\ndinner and reception. On the evening of November 12th the famous Caves\r\nof Elephanta were visited and a banquet received by the Prince of Wales\r\namongst these wonderful and massive efforts of distant ages to embody\r\nwhat seemed to them the divine attributes. Returning to the city the\r\nRoyal barge passed between two rows of ships, discharging volleys, while\r\nthe hulls and riggings were brightly illuminated, coloured fires were\r\neverywhere and earth and sky seemed merged in a tremendous display of\r\nfireworks and rockets. A visit to Poonah followed and this included an\r\ninspection of the Temple of Parbuttee, from one of the windows of which\r\nthe last of the Peishwas had seen his forces routed on the plains of\r\nKirkee below; a review of native troops; a reception in the city\r\ncharacterized by the usual fireworks, triumphal arches, crowded streets\r\nand revel of colour.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th, His Royal Highness was back at Bombay considering plans\r\nwhich had been disarranged by the prevalence of cholera in Southern\r\nIndia. Finally, it was decided to visit Baroda, the capital of a State\r\nwhere the Gaekwar had recently been deposed for his crimes. It was felt\r\nthat danger might exist, as even the most evil of Eastern rulers has\r\nfanatical followers, but the former Resident, Sir R. Meade, expressed\r\nthe belief that it could be done safely and would be of great service\r\nand the authorities and Prince, after much discussion, approved the\r\nchange of programme. This last day in Bombay saw the presentation of\r\ncolours to a battalion of Native Infantry amidst an immense concourse of\r\npeople, and a ball given by the citizens at which natives, Chiefs and\r\ngentlemen could see Europeans dancing and amusing themselves. The\r\npresents received during this part of the tour numbered over four\r\nhundred and included specimens of every variety of Indian\r\nworkmanship--tissues, brocade, cloths, arms, jewellery, gold, silver and\r\nmetal. The Rajah of Kolapore, in addition to the gift of an ancient\r\njewelled sword and dagger, had assigned £20,000, or $100,000, to the\r\nfounding of a Hospital to be called after the Royal visitor.\r\n\r\nThe journey to Baroda was commenced on November 18th and finished early\r\non the following morning. At the station the Prince of Wales was\r\nreceived by the Gaekwar, Sir Madhava Rao, the British agent and other\r\nofficers, and outside were triumphal arches and a rolling sea of dark,\r\nsilent faces, topped by turbans of every colour in the rainbow. Outside\r\nalso was an enormous elephant, with a golden howdah on his back, and\r\ninto this the Prince and the Gaekwar presently entered. Everything was\r\ncloth of gold and velvet. The procession started after a time with a\r\nlong line of gorgeously-caparisoned elephants following, a way was\r\ncleared for them by an advance guard of the 3rd Hussars, while in the\r\nrear were some of the Gaekwar's artillery and cavalry and a great crowd\r\nof Sirdars and lesser chiefs. The three miles to the Residency was lined\r\nby cavalry, and the spectacle must have been a superb one to see for the\r\nfirst time. The whole of the route was bordered by a light trellis work\r\nof bamboos, hung with lamps and festooned with flowers, while at certain\r\npoints were special arches and clusters of flags. On his arrival the\r\nPrince held a sort of Durbar, paid a return visit to the Gaekwar and\r\nwent to the Agga, or arena for wild-beast combats, where he saw Eastern\r\nwrestlers, an elephant fight, a buffalo fight, a struggle of fighting\r\nrams, and a show of wild or curious animals. The night was brilliant\r\nwith illuminations, and the Prince accepted an invitation to dine with\r\nthe 9th Native Infantry--an honour of which they were very proud.\r\n\r\nThe next day was devoted to sport, and in the evening dinner was taken\r\nwith another Native regiment. On the evening of the 21st the Prince\r\nvisited the Gaekwar at the ancient Palace of the Mohtee Bagh, and on the\r\nway crossed a bridge spanned by triumphal arches, with men holding\r\nblazing torches placed along the parapets. Lamps and lights were\r\neverywhere. A great banquet was held, in the course of which Sir Madhava\r\nRao expressed the thanks of the Gaekwar, and said that \"it was now\r\ntheir felicity to see that Prince who was heir to a sceptre whose\r\nbeneficent power and influence were felt in every quarter of the globe;\r\nwhich dispelled darkness, diffused light, paralyzed the tyrant's hand,\r\nshivered the manacles of the slave, extended the bounds of freedom,\r\naccelerated the happiness and elevated the dignity of the human race. He\r\nhad come to inspect an Empire founded by the heroism and sustained by\r\nthe statesmanship of England; to witness the spectacle of indigenous\r\nprincipalities relying more securely on British justice than could\r\nmighty nations on their embattled hosts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE TAKES PART IN A HUNTING EXPEDITION\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, various Eastern performances in dancing and juggling were\r\ngiven, and then they departed for the shooting grounds farther south,\r\nwhere \"pig-sticking\" and other sports were enjoyed. His Royal Highness\r\nsucceeded in killing one wild boar. On November the 24th the Royal\r\nvisitor arrived again at Bombay and went on board the _Serapis_. On the\r\nfollowing day he landed to take leave of the Governor, and suddenly, to\r\nthe dismay of the local authorities who had lined his announced route\r\nwith troops, intimated his intention to attend the wedding festivities\r\nof the son of Sir Munguldass Nuthoobhoy, a great native merchant. The\r\nvisit proved well worth the trouble, and the undisguised delight of the\r\nhost and those present was a privilege to see. A farewell incident was\r\nthe knighting of the energetic Chief of Police, Sir F. H. Soutar. At 6\r\nP.M. the _Serapis_ was on its way to Goa.\r\n\r\nThe visit to this ancient Portuguese dependency was not prolonged and\r\nthe incidents of importance were few. But much that was curious was seen\r\nand many historical memories revived. On November 28th the little\r\nforeign strip of territory was left behind and Beypore was sighted on\r\nthe following day. It was found, however, that cholera existed along all\r\nthe routes which the Prince proposed to take in this part of the\r\ncountry and the medical men would not take the responsibility of\r\nadvising a continuance of the tour in this direction. The Prince bore\r\nhis disappointment philosophically, though he had expected much pleasure\r\nfrom the splendid shooting places of the Mysore country. What can be\r\nsaid, however, of the disappointed people and authorities? The Mysore\r\nGovernment had spent thousands of pounds in preparation; Ootacamund,\r\nBangalore, Travancore and other places had laid out much money and the\r\npopulation for hundreds of miles was stirred with expectancy. A visit\r\nwas paid to the shore and a brief glance taken at the old-time land of\r\nTippoo Sahib, and then the voyage was resumed to Ceylon.\r\n\r\nOn December 1st the lights of Colombo were sighted, and soon the\r\nfamiliar spectacle of British men-of-war dressed to welcome royalty was\r\nseen. The sight at the landing-place was a pretty one, and the long\r\navenue of gaily-decorated and flower-garlanded boats through which the\r\nRoyal barge first passed was equally so. The Prince was received in a\r\nbeautiful pavilion under a striking archway and everywhere in sight were\r\narches and flags and palm-leaves, and massed displays of fruits and\r\nflowers, and tier on tier of spectators. All the dignitaries of Ceylon\r\nwere there and the usual addresses and replies were given. Thence the\r\nPrince passed to the Government Buildings and took a drive round the\r\ntown, meeting everywhere an enthusiastic and sincerely generous\r\nreception and a wealth of decoration in fruits and flowers and ferns.\r\nHis Royal Highness gave a state banquet on the _Serapis_ in the evening,\r\nwhile Colombo was illuminated and the ships were a blaze of light. Never\r\nwere the Cinghelese more happy than on that day and night, and\r\nspectators found it hard to describe the revel of light, fantastic,\r\nEastern pleasure. On the following day the railway train was taken for\r\nKandy amid genuine British cheers from throngs of men clad in\r\npetticoats and wearing combs in front of their _chignons_.\r\n\r\nAt this splendidly situated town--the ancient stronghold of Chiefs and\r\nthe seat of more than one rebellion against earlier British rule--the\r\nPrince was received by a great number of queerly-clad but distinguished\r\npersonages and Buddhist priests. The Governor, Mr. W. H. Gregory, who\r\naccompanied the Royal traveller, was unusually popular and this,\r\nperhaps, helped in the success of the reception. Addresses were received\r\nand in the evening the Governor held a state dinner attended by all the\r\nnotabilities of Ceylon and accompanied outside by the beating of native\r\ndrums, the blowing of myriad horns, the clang of mighty gongs and sounds\r\nof distant cheering. Afterwards the Prince witnessed a grotesque and\r\nextraordinary procession of elephants, dancers and priests of the\r\nTemple. On the following day he visited the Royal Botanical Gardens and\r\nin the evening held an investiture of the Order of St. Michael and St.\r\nGeorge at which the Governor was knighted and some lesser honours given.\r\nThe Chiefs and their stately and dignified wives were then formally\r\npresented. From the audience hall he afterwards passed to the Temple and\r\nwas shown the famous \"Sacred Tooth of Gotama Buddha\"--an object of\r\nveneration to many millions of the human race and of visible fear to the\r\npriests who stood around the Prince or took it from its precious and\r\nnumerous cases. On December the 4th the Prince went on a visit to the\r\ninterior of this wonderfully beautiful country and enjoyed the\r\nexcitement of an elephant hunt and of killing some of those colossal\r\ncreatures of the jungle. Colombo was reached again, three days later,\r\nand another state banquet attended in the evening. On the following day\r\nthe new Breakwater was inaugurated by the Prince and in the evening a\r\nfarewell banquet received and the city left amid scenes of brilliant\r\nillumination and fantastic Eastern beauty.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales and his suite landed in Tuticorin on the coast of\r\nIndia, again, on December 9th, and proceeded inland by train without any\r\nparticular or formal reception. The Tamils were found to be a handsome,\r\nmild-natured, respectful people and the land cultivated and apparently\r\nprosperous. At Mainachy, a deputation of six thousand native Christians\r\nand one thousand boys and girls, headed by the Rev. Dr. Caldwell and the\r\nRev. Dr. Sargent, presented an address and a handsomely-bound Bible and\r\nPrayer-book in the Tamil language, to His Royal Highness. A native\r\n\"lyric\" was then sung by the children including words of which the\r\nfollowing is a translation: \"Crossing seas and crossing mountains, thou\r\nhast visited this southern-most region and granted to those who live\r\nunder the shadow of thy Royal umbrella a sight of thy benign\r\ncountenance.\" Madura was reached a few hours later and found to be\r\nprofusely decorated, one of the arches being made of native work in\r\nperforated paper, covered with talc plates and silver plaques in front\r\nof a screen of red. The name of the town signified \"sweetness\" and it\r\nturned out to be a place of great charm, imposing buildings and unusual\r\ncleanliness. The Rajah of Pudducottah was duly received and during his\r\nvisit he showed the Prince a book consisting of original letters,\r\ndispatches etc., which had passed between Clive and his own ancestor\r\nduring the times of French and English struggle for supremacy in\r\nSouthern India. The Prince visited some of the ancient buildings of the\r\nplace, including the Temple of Minakshee, where Nautch girls scattered\r\nflowers before him and garlands were placed over his shoulders, and the\r\nTank of the Golden Lotus and received a number of interesting presents\r\nfrom the Rajah and from the Ranee of Shivagunga. He left on December\r\n11th for Trichinoply, where he arrived in a few hours.\r\n\r\nHere, His Royal Highness, after his progress through flowers, arches,\r\ncrowds, officials and decorations of unusual richness and taste, visited\r\nthe famous Temple of Seringham which has been described as \"a vast\r\nbewildering mass of gate, towers, enclosures, courts, terraces and\r\nhalls.\" In one of the last-named there were one thousand columns of\r\ngranite each consisting of one block and carved with elaborate images of\r\ndeities. The next place seen was the ancient Palace of the Nawabs of the\r\nCarnatic and here presentation of the notabilities of the city took\r\nplace and an address was received by the future European Emperor of\r\nIndia in the very home of the olden Eastern power. The scene from this\r\nplace in the evening was very striking--immense multitudes below, a\r\ngreat tank full of boats and blazing with coloured fires and lights,\r\nClive's historic home on the opposite side and, above and over all, the\r\nvast pyramidical pile, the Rock of Trichinoply, with its Temple of\r\nGanesa crowning the famous precipice and towering above the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCE WELCOMED IN MADRAS\r\n\r\nOn December the 12th, the Royal visitor was again travelling and on the\r\nfollowing day reached Madras, where he was formally welcomed by\r\nLieutenant-Governor the Duke of Buckingham, the Rajah of Cochin, the\r\nMaharajah of Travancore, the Prince of Arcot, the Rajah of Vizianagram\r\nand others. The procession then passed from the station to Government\r\nHouse through the narrow streets of the native town and the wide\r\nthoroughfares of the European quarters. A golden umbrella was held over\r\nthe Prince's head and thus the massed populace--more fortunate than that\r\nof Bombay--was able to be certain of his identity. At the Wallahjah\r\nBridge some thousands of students and boys and girls were ranged on both\r\nsides, each school with its distinctive banners and badges. The\r\naudiences given afterwards at Government House to Native Chiefs, and the\r\nreturn visits, were conducted in the same manner and style as those at\r\nBombay. In the afternoon a crowded Levée was held and in the evening a\r\nstate banquet given to which the Governor invited all the chief\r\npersonages in the City and Presidency. A brief reception followed and\r\nthen His Royal Highness drove out to the Duke's country residence where\r\nhe spent the following day in seclusion as being the anniversary of his\r\nfather's death.\r\n\r\nThe events of the succeeding day included fashionable and interesting\r\nraces at Guindy Park which all the Madras world attended under the\r\npatronage of the Prince; and in the afternoon a Royal reception of the\r\nChancellor and officers and Fellows of the University; of the Grand\r\nOfficers of the local Freemasonry; of Commissions or deputations from\r\nMysore and Coorg and Coimbatore. Each of the latter bore gifts and all\r\npresented addresses. Formal calls were made upon the principal Chiefs\r\nand a memorial foundation stone of the new Harbour works laid. The\r\nlatter was an impressive scene and on his way home the Prince, despite\r\npouring rain, visited the historic Fort of St. George with its many\r\nreminders of past struggle and conquest. Another state banquet and\r\nreception followed.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the Prince enjoyed a spectacle of Indian jugglery\r\nand saw feats performed which in a western land would be deemed\r\nmiraculous. December the 17th saw His Royal Highness lunching at the\r\nMadras Club where he tested Indian curries in their highest state of\r\ndevelopment and in the afternoon he was welcomed at the Park by\r\nthousands of children. A little later he reviewed a body of troops\r\naccompanied by the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Paul Haines. With the latter\r\nhe dined in the evening and at ten o'clock drove to the Pier to see the\r\ngreat event of the visit. This was an illumination of the sea. Mr. W. H.\r\nRussell in his _Diary_ says: \"Man will never see any spectacle more\r\nstrange--nay awful. Neither pen nor pencil can give any idea of it. It\r\nwas exciting, grand, wierd and beautiful.\" Fireworks from the ships\r\nlooked like volcanoes bursting from the deep, while multiplied\r\nfireboats had an effect upon the stony ink-blackness of the surf, like\r\nrolling flames pouring in upon the shores. At midnight the Prince passed\r\nfrom this scene to a special Native entertainment in his honour. The\r\ngreat railway station had been converted into a decorated theatre\r\ncrowded with many thousand natives. Upon the elevated platform the\r\nPrince received an address and an exquisite gold casket and then watched\r\na programme of eastern dancing. At six in the morning the Prince was up\r\nand away to attend a meet of the Madras pack and enjoy a few hours'\r\nsport--and in the afternoon the _Serapis_ was again his home and Madras\r\nwas left behind.\r\n\r\nAfter a pleasant voyage up the Bay of Bengal the Prince of Wales arrived\r\nat Fort William, passed through a great fleet of vessels and prepared to\r\nenter Calcutta, the capital of the great Eastern Empire. Meantime, many\r\neminent Indian officials and unofficial personages called to pay their\r\nrespects and finally, the Earl of Northbrook, Viceroy and\r\nGovernor-General. Amidst the thunder of artillery from fleet and forts\r\nHis Royal Highness then landed and was welcomed by a great multitude of\r\npeople, luxuriously seated in tiers of seats ranged beside two pavilions\r\ndraped in scarlet, the canopies of which were upheld by gold pillars\r\nwreathed with flowers. Beyond was a massive arch of triumph and the\r\nplatform and landing stage was carpeted with red cloth. In the\r\nsurrounding crowd was the whole central machinery of government amongst\r\nthree hundred millions of people and Rajahs, Chiefs and authorities\r\ninnumerable. The procession through the \"City of Palaces\" was marked by\r\nthe same splendour, the same crowds, the same curious contrasts as had\r\nimpressed the observer at Bombay. But the absence of the night effect\r\nand its wierd illumination and the presence of certain indefinable\r\nelements made it more dignified; while the greater number of English\r\npeople gave a certain leaven of western enthusiasm which had been\r\nwanting elsewhere. In the evening a magnificent banquet was given by\r\nthe Viceroy and the city was a blaze of light and the scene of general\r\nfestivity.\r\n\r\nThe day before Christmas saw a state reception more remarkable than any\r\nyet held. The first native prince to be received was the Maharajah of\r\nPuttiala--a melancholy-faced man who died soon afterwards. Then followed\r\nthe Maharajah Holkar of Indore who was said to have £5,000,000 in gold\r\nstored away; the Maharajah of Jodhpore, who wore an indescribable\r\nglittering mass of gems; the Maharajahs of Jeypore, Cashmere, Gwalior;\r\nthe Sultana Jehan, Begum of Bhopal, of whom little more than a shawl and\r\na silk hood could be seen; and the Maharajah of Rewah, a dignified\r\npersonage who was said by some writers to be suffering from leprosy. A\r\nLevée was then held and the Prince, for two hours, with the Duke of\r\nSutherland on one side of him and Lieutenant-Governor Sir Richard Temple\r\non the other, stood in full uniform bowing to a steady stream of people.\r\nAnother state banquet in the evening, and then attendance at an\r\nentertainment some miles out of town gotten up by Native gentlemen,\r\nbrought this Christmas Eve to a close. On the following day the Prince\r\nattended service at the Cathedral accompanied by Lord Northbrook and\r\nlistened to a powerful sermon from Bishop Milman--who died of a fever\r\ncaught on his Episcopal tour a few weeks later. He then drove to the\r\nharbour and went on board the _Serapis_, which was decked out in\r\nimitation of winter, and here had a sort of Christmas dinner. The rest\r\nof the day was spent at Barrackpoor, the Viceroy's country residence,\r\nbut better known as the place where the terrible first signs of the\r\nMutiny were detected. After church on the 26th (Sunday) the Prince made\r\nan excursion to the little French territory of Chandernagore--one of the\r\nremnants of historic empire.\r\n\r\nOn the following day His Royal Highness held another reception for\r\nChiefs attended by envoys from the King of Burmah, the Maharajah of\r\nPunnah in person, an embassy from Nepaul, the noble-looking Rajah of\r\nJheend, the Maharajahs of Benares, Nahun, and Johore. This was the last\r\nof the Chiefs, for the moment, and the Prince and his wearied suite\r\ncould rest from a succession of sights and ceremonies in which\r\ndark-featured magnates with diamonds, emeralds, rubies and pearls and an\r\ninfinite variety of Sirdar escorts, must have come to be a mere\r\npicturesque and confused medley. Many splendid presents were received\r\nand on the two following days return visits were paid in state. On\r\nDecember 21st the Prince witnessed a tent-pegging exhibition by the 10th\r\nBengal Cavalry, made a round of the hospitals and asylums, and wound up\r\nwith a garden party at Belvidere and a dinner and grand ball at\r\nGovernment House.\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Day the Prince of Wales held a Chapter of the Order of the\r\nStar of India in place of the Durbar which could only be held by the\r\ndirect representative of the Sovereign. Opposite the entrance to\r\nGovernment House a canopied dais was erected, carpeted with cloth of\r\ngold, covered with light-blue satin and supported upon silver pillars.\r\nTwo chairs with silver arms were placed upon the dais and around it were\r\nthe marines and sailors of the _Serapis_ while on the left were infantry\r\nof the line. At nine o'clock came the processions, each presaged by a\r\nflourish of trumpets. First came the Companions of the Order, Native and\r\nEuropean, presenting a stream of picturesque uniforms and costumes. Then\r\nthe Knights Grand Cross entered the Pavilion followed in the case of\r\neach Indian dignitary by a small procession of Sirdars in rich and\r\nvaried dress--the Begum of Bhopal, Sir Salar Jung, the Maharajah of\r\nPuttiala, Lord Napier of Magdala, the Maharajah of Travancore, Sir\r\nBartle Frere, the Maharajahs of Rewah, Jeypoor, Indore, Cashmere, and\r\nGwalior. Then came the Prince of Wales wearing a white helmet and plume,\r\nand a Field Marshal's uniform almost concealed by his sky-blue mantle.\r\nFollowing him was the Viceroy and the two took the chairs placed on the\r\ndais. His Excellency, as Grand Master of the Order, then went through\r\nthe ceremonial of opening the Chapter and then, from out the tented\r\nfield of, literally, cloth of gold which surrounded the Royal pavilion,\r\ncame one by one the Knights to be. Each in turn left his tent with\r\nstately accompaniments, approached, bowed and knelt at the footstool of\r\nHis Royal Highness who spoke certain prescribed words and placed the\r\nCollar of the Order around his neck. As he rose the number of guns to\r\nwhich he was entitled thundered forth their salute. The Maharajahs of\r\nJodhpoor and Jheend were thus invested with the Grand Cross and a number\r\nof others were made Knights Commander or Companions of the Order. The\r\nproceedings closed with a procession to Government House which lacked no\r\nelement of Oriental splendour and displayed untold wealth in jewels and\r\nunique characteristics in costume.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the Prince unveiled an equestrian statue of the late\r\nLord Mayo and afterwards attended a polo match. In the evening he drove\r\nto see the illumination of the fleet and then attended in state a\r\ntheatrical performance with Charles Matthews as the central figure. On\r\nJanuary 2nd, church was attended at Fort William and the arsenal\r\ninspected; the Botanical Gardens and Bishop's College visited; and an\r\namateur concert of sacred music listened to at Government House in the\r\nevening. The next day's programme included the spectacle of tent-pegging\r\nand polo-playing between rival regiments; the reception of an LL. D.\r\ndegree from the University of Calcutta; a visit to a Hindoo Zenana under\r\narrangements made by Miss Baring, Lady Temple and others; and a farewell\r\nreception at Government House.\r\n\r\nThe Royal special train arrived at Bankipoor station, near Patna, on the\r\nmorning of January 4th and the Prince was duly welcomed by Sir Richard\r\nTemple, Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, his officers and a great\r\nconcourse of people. He was driven through an avenue of four hundred\r\nelephants, all gaily caparisoned, to the Durbar tent, where, under a\r\ncanopy and in front of a sort of throne, His Royal Highness held a Levée\r\nand marked in every way possible his approval of the splendid work\r\nlately done by Sir R. Temple and his officials in stamping out famine.\r\nLuncheon followed, and then the train was taken for Benares. Here he\r\narrived at dark and found the magnificent ghauts or terraces alive with\r\nlights. The procession drove over the bridge of boats across the Ganges\r\nand through crowded streets out to the camp of the Lieutenant-Governor,\r\nSir John Strachey, where a special and beautiful structure had been\r\nprepared for the Prince. On the following day an address was presented\r\nby the Municipality of Benares and answered, a Levée held, the\r\nfoundation-stone of a Hospital laid, the Rajah of Vizianagram visited,\r\nthe famous Temples inspected. At sunset the Prince embarked in a galley\r\nand went four miles up the Ganges to the old Fort of Ramnagar, where he\r\nwas received at a carpeted and decorated landing-place by the Maharajah\r\nof Benares and witnessed a beautiful spectacle of illuminated river and\r\nbattlements. Preceded by spearsmen and banners, carried in gold and\r\nsilver chairs, passing between lines of cavalry, accompanied by\r\nelephants and the constant strains of wild music, the host and his Royal\r\nguest then went to the Castle. From the roof was seen another charming\r\nsight--the Ganges and its banks and terraces so lit up as to look like a\r\nmyriad of tiny stars passing between banks of flaming gold. More\r\npresents were received and the drive back to the camp commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE VISITS LUCKNOW\r\n\r\nNext day, the journey was resumed to Lucknow, on the Oudh and Rohilcund\r\nRailway. At that much-modernized city the Prince of Wales arrived on\r\nJanuary 6th and stayed at what was once Outram's head-quarters. Here,\r\nnext morning, he held two Levées--a Native and a European one--and then\r\ndrove to see the historic spots of the famous city. In the afternoon he\r\nlaid the foundation-stone of a Memorial to the Natives who fell in\r\ndefence of the Residency and the Empire during the Mutiny. Lord\r\nNorthbrook had succeeded in getting together many of the survivors from\r\nall over India and they stood around His Royal Highness in their old\r\nwar-worn uniforms. A touching scene followed the Prince's impromptu\r\nintimation that these veterans might be presented to him, and to each he\r\nsaid a word of kindness. In the afternoon a Native entertainment was\r\ngiven in his honour at the ancient Palace of the Kings of Oudh and a\r\ncrown set in jewels was presented with the formal address. A reception,\r\nbanquet, and fireworks, followed, and on the next day the Prince enjoyed\r\na little hard riding and \"pig-sticking\" sport, during which Lord\r\nCarington had his collar-bone broken.\r\n\r\nSunday was spent quietly in visiting various interesting places, after\r\nchurch, and on the succeeding day the Prince presented colours to a\r\nNative regiment and watched a march-past of troops. In the afternoon\r\nCawnpore was visited, and then the train taken for Delhi, which was\r\nreached on the morning of January 11th. The entry into the Imperial City\r\nwas surrounded with all possible pomp and circumstance. Lines of\r\nsoldiery kept the streets from the station to the Royal camp, where rows\r\nof tents, avenues of shrubs and flowers, marquees and beautiful\r\nenclosures, formed a temporary home for the visitor and his suite. The\r\nfirst function was the reception of an address from the Municipality of\r\na city which for one thousand years had been the seat of dynasties and\r\nnative rule. A Levée followed and then dinner with Lord Napier of\r\nMagdala in his own mess-tent. On the following day a grand review was\r\nheld and for an hour and a half a stream of horse, foot and guns flowed\r\npast. Then came a great banquet given by the Prince to the generals and\r\nofficers and a ball at Selinghur in those \"marble halls of dazzling\r\nlight\" which have been so often described. During the next few days a\r\ngreat sham fight was held; a visit paid to the Kootab, where the Prince\r\nmounted the summit of the famous pillar and viewed the wide-spread scene\r\nof ruin; the beautiful Mausoleum of Houmayoun was seen; and the\r\nillumination of the ancient city witnessed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA REMARKABLE SPECTACLE AT LAHORE\r\n\r\nOn January 17th the beautiful city of tents disappeared and the Prince\r\nof Wales was on his way to Lahore. There, he was received with the usual\r\nstate and drove four miles to Government House under the shade of a\r\ngolden umbrella and in the gaze of a vast multitude of people. A\r\nremarkable spectacle was presented on the way by the encampment of the\r\nRajahs of the Punjaub. In front of them stood a long line of elephants,\r\ncaparisoned in gold and silver and gems, with armed retainers and a\r\nsalute for the Royal visitor, which included all that the roll of drums,\r\nblare of trumpets and clang and roar of many strange instruments could\r\nproduce. Amidst the elephants flashed lance and sword and cuirass and\r\nother things reminiscent of the days of western chivalry. At Government\r\nHouse an address was presented by the members of the City Council,\r\nwearing turbans of gold tissue, brocaded robes and coils of gems around\r\ntheir necks. A European Levée followed and then came the Native Chiefs.\r\nAfterwards the Prince visited the citadel and watched the sun set over\r\nthe plains from a window once used by the Lion of Lahore in his days of\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe next day saw a return visit to the Chiefs in their picturesque,\r\ncostly and oriental encampments; the opening of a Soldiers' Industrial\r\nExhibition at Mean Meer; and a beautiful illumination of the exquisite\r\nShalimar Gardens in the evening. On January 20th the Prince left for\r\nJummoo to visit the Maharajah of Cashmere. Later in the day he was\r\nwelcomed by this ruler, some seven miles from his capital and, mounted\r\non an elephant preceeded and followed by a stately _cortege_, the Royal\r\nvisitor passed through two miles of winding streets, brilliantly lighted\r\nand lined by Native troops, while piled-up masses of people showed many\r\ntypes of the Cashmeres, Lamas, Sikhs, Afghans, etc. On the summit of a\r\ngreat ridge was a specially constructed building created at enormous\r\ncost for the visitor's accommodation. The usual reception followed\r\ntogether with a great banquet. Sport was the occupation of the next day\r\nand in the evening a procession took place through the illuminated city\r\nto dine at the Palace with the Maharajah. A feature of the latter's\r\nentertainment was an extraordinary sacred dancing drama by Lamas from\r\nThibet. The departure on the following morning occurred amid all the\r\nstate that Cashmere could present--and that was not little. At\r\nWazirabad, on the way back to Lahore, a brief visit was paid, a great\r\nbridge inaugurated and a banquet accepted. Government House was reached\r\nin the evening and, with Lieutenant-Governor Sir H. Davies, His Royal\r\nHighness then attended a Native entertainment at the College and\r\nwitnessed fireworks lighting up all the forts and battlements and a sea\r\nof heads in the distant darkness.\r\n\r\nAfter a quiet Sunday at Lahore, the departure was made for Agra. On the\r\nway Umritzur was visited and the route to the Fort was lined and arched\r\nwith artificial cypress-trees, gilded branches and garlands. An address\r\nwas presented from the Municipality in which Sikh, Mohammedan and Hindoo\r\nunited in expressions of fervent loyalty. Here the Golden Temple was\r\nvisited. At Rajpoorah a stop was made to accept a banquet from the\r\nMaharajah of Puttiala in a beautiful palace of canvas. Early on January\r\n25th Agra was reached and the usual Oriental reception and procession\r\nfollowed. At the camp on the following day a Levée was held and a large\r\nnumber of Native Chiefs presented. In the afternoon the troops of the\r\nlatter passed in review before the Prince--a mixture of thousands of men\r\nand elephants, camels, horses and bullocks, and knights in armour.\r\n\r\nThe principal event of the ensuing day was a visit to the famous and\r\nexquisite Taj Mahul--\"too pure, too holy, to be the work of human\r\nhands.\" During the next few days some time was spent in shooting with\r\nthe Maharajah of Bhurtpore; a grand ball was given at the Fort; a long\r\ninterview granted Sir Dinkur Rao, the Native statesman; local convents\r\nand schools visited; the tomb of Akbar the Great--described as the\r\ngrandest in the world--seen at Sekundra; a visit paid to the loyal\r\nMaharajah of Gwalior at Dholepoor. The next point visited was the famous\r\nold fortress of Bhurtpore and then the beautiful city of Jeypoor. Here\r\nthe Prince went tiger shooting with the Rajpoot Chiefs and shot his\r\ntiger and, in the evening of February 5th, saw illuminations in which\r\nevery Indian device appeared to have been exhausted. From the\r\nhospitalities of the Maharajah the Prince, however, soon turned away\r\nwith his face towards the Himalayas and his heart in the prospective\r\nperiod of sport and liberty. The land of Kumaoun was the scene and with\r\nhim was a camp which included twenty-five hundred persons without\r\ncounting a perambulating army of provision carriers. Bears, elephants,\r\ntigers, wild boars and varied birds and game were amongst the trophies\r\nof his gun during a period of splendid sport which lasted until March\r\n6th.\r\n\r\nOn that day the Prince resumed his tour and his Royal state and\r\nproceeded to Allahabad where he was met by Lord Northbrood and held a\r\nreception and an investiture of the Star of India at which Major-General\r\nSir Samuel Browne, V.C., Major-General Sir D. M. Probyn and\r\nSurgeon-General Sir J. Fayrer received the ensignias of knighthood. The\r\nroute was then continued to Indore and, on the way, the Prince stopped\r\nlong enough at Jubalpoor to see seven Thugs who had been in jail for\r\nthirty-five years for having committed an immense number of murders--one\r\nof them boasted sixty-five. At Indore, His Royal Highness was received\r\nby the Maharajah Holkar with due state and went through the usual\r\nprogramme of reception, visits and banquets--important in this case as\r\nbeing the last. Bombay was reached on March 11th and two days later all\r\nfarewells were made and the future Emperor of India had left the shores\r\nof that mysterious, tragic and historical land, after having travelled\r\nin seventeen weeks seven thousand six hundred miles by land and two\r\nthousand three hundred miles by sea; met more Chiefs and notabilities\r\nthan all the Indian Viceroys of the past put together; and seen more of\r\nthe country and its surface life and varied customs than any living man.\r\n\r\n\r\nHE MEETS LORD LYTTON AT SUEZ\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Prince addressed a letter to the Viceroy expressing\r\nappreciation of the reception given to him and of the loyalty shown by\r\nthe people. On the way home news came that Lord Lytton, the first\r\nrepresentative of the Queen as Empress of India, was on the way out. As\r\na personal friend of the Prince of Wales it was fitting that they should\r\nmeet at Suez, where the new Viceroy came on board. At Cairo, the Prince\r\nwas welcomed by the Khedive and his suite and a new round of gaiety\r\ncommenced, including visits to the Pyramids and a little quiet shooting.\r\nAt Alexandria, on April 2nd the Prince entertained the Grand Duke Alexis\r\nof Russia at dinner on the _Serapis_. The next point touched was Malta,\r\nwhere the thunder of the saluting fleet and fortress made the heavens\r\nring. Here, seven addresses were presented and much enthusiasm shown by\r\nthe populace. A great banquet was given by Sir W. and Lady Straubenzee\r\nand on April 7th new colours were presented by His Royal Highness to\r\nthe 98th Regiment. Other functions followed. On April 15th the Prince\r\nwas joined by his brother, the Duke of Connaught. The Island was _en\r\nfête_, and one of the events of the visit was the reception of a\r\ndeputation from the Sultan of Morrocco. The festive proceedings of the\r\ntime were wound up with a great ball.\r\n\r\n\r\nWELCOMED IN SPAIN\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales landed _incognito_ at Cadiz on April 20th and then\r\nproceeded, with the Duke of Connaught quietly to visit Seville and\r\nCordova. At Madrid, which was reached on April 25th, the Royal party\r\nwere formally welcomed by King Alfonso XII. and attended a state\r\nreception at the Palace. A military review was held by the King, and\r\nthen a train was taken for the Palace of the Escurial, where King\r\nAlfonso acted as guide for his Royal guests amidst the bewildering\r\nartistic and other treasures of that immense and historic pile. Various\r\nfunctions of stately dignity followed the return of the Prince to\r\nMadrid, and the departure of the Duke for London, and the incidents of\r\nthe period included attendance at a sitting of the Spanish Cortes, and\r\nthe spectacle of a bull-fight. On April 30th His Royal Highness departed\r\nfor Lisbon, where, on the following day, he was formally welcomed by\r\nKing Louis of Portugal, his Court, the Foreign Ministers and the British\r\nAdmirals of the fleet in the Tagus. There were no flags, or arches, or\r\ndecorations, or tokens of welcome in the streets of Lisbon, but there\r\nwas a vast mass of silent and respectful people. Many functions followed\r\nduring the next few days and on May 7th the _Serapis_ started once more\r\nfor England. Four days later the ship was met by a yacht bearing the\r\nPrincess of Wales and the Royal children and, in a few hours, the Heir\r\nApparent was again at home from his famous journey and receiving a\r\nwelcome at Portsmouth which was a fitting prelude to similar greetings\r\nin London and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSuch a tremendous experience as this tour had proved could not but have\r\na pronounced and important effect. The burden of a continuous succession\r\nof events in which he was the central figure; the strain of a steady\r\nsuccession of brilliant spectacles presenting a kaleidoscopic variety of\r\nsight and sound and splendour and incident; the weight of a constant\r\nburden of ceremonial and state observances in a land where the slightest\r\ncarelessness, or indifference, or cordiality--at the wrong moment--meant\r\nmortal offense to some important dignitary, caste, or interest; the\r\nphysical trial of innumerable functions to a man clad in European\r\ncostumes in a tropical climate; the infinite variety of his duties, the\r\npeculiar character of the hours maintained, the lack of sleep and the\r\ncontinuous round of banquets; must have tried the mind and heart and\r\nbody about equally. In the end the experience must have broadened the\r\nconceptions and ideas of the Prince; educated him in a better perception\r\nof his immense responsibilities; trained him in an iron school of\r\netiquette and helped to teach him that inflexible routine of duty which\r\nmust ever face a British Sovereign.\r\n\r\nTo the people of India the tour brought home a clearer perception of the\r\npersonal power presiding over their destinies and a vivid picture of the\r\ngreatness of the authority before which all their greatest dignitaries\r\nwith the traditions of many thousand years, bowed in loyal obeisance. To\r\nthe imaginative Indian mind nothing more effective could have been\r\npresented than the scenes of that brilliant and triumphal passage\r\nthrough the stamping ground of ancient conquerors. To the people of\r\nGreat Britain it brought home a more realizable sense of the vastness of\r\ntheir dominions and the equivalent greatness of their national duty and\r\nresponsibility. It helped to lay the foundation of that Imperial future\r\nof which Disraeli then dreamed and for which others have since laboured\r\nwith a measure of success shown in the events preceding and following\r\nthe accession of Edward VII., King and Emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nThirty Years of Public Work\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the years between 1872 and the end of the century the Prince of\r\nWales filled a place in public affairs not unlike that of the Prince\r\nConsort in the later and ripest period of his useful life. He grew\r\nsteadily in the faculties which make for wisdom in council and action\r\nwhile retaining and developing the qualities which make for popularity\r\nand, in a Prince, may embody the characteristics and feelings of his\r\nnation. In those thirty years he saw much and travelled far; met many\r\nmen of varied qualities and attainments and character; learned much by\r\npersonal experience and observation and much from other people's\r\nexperience; tested almost the pinnacle of earthly splendour in his\r\nIndian tour and learned in private something of the suffering which\r\ncomes to all individuals whether great or little. He created the\r\nposition of Heir Apparent as now understood; gave it a significance and\r\nvalue never before attained to; and filled it with a tact and ability\r\nwhich no detraction or misrepresentation could practically affect, and\r\nwhich in time made him the admittedly most all-round popular man in the\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\n\r\nBefore his illness the Prince had carried out a good many public\r\nengagements and helped a great number of useful objects. After that\r\nevent and the outpouring of popular sentiment which found vent in the\r\nNational Thanksgiving he became still more devoted to his round of\r\npublic duties. On July 5th 1872, His Royal Highness visited the new\r\nGrammar School at Norwich and inspected the Norfolk Artillery Militia\r\nof which he was Honorary Colonel. At a banquet given by the Mayor he\r\nreferred to his late illness, in expressing thanks for local sympathy,\r\nand added: \"It is difficult now for me to speak upon that subject but as\r\nit has pleased Almighty God to preserve me to my country I hope I may\r\nnot be ungrateful for the feeling which has been shown towards me and\r\nthat I may do all that I can to be of use to my countrymen.\" On July\r\n25th, he reviewed four thousand boys of the Training ships and Pauper\r\nSchools of the Metropolitan Unions at South Kensington, and distributed\r\nprizes. The Prince was accompanied by the Princess of Wales and his\r\nsons. A little later, on August 11th, the Breakwater at Portland was\r\ninaugurated, the Royal yacht being accompanied from Osborne by a\r\nsplendid fleet of fifteen ironclads. At the conclusion of the ceremony\r\nthe Prince visited Weymouth, which was gaily decorated, and where he\r\naccepted a public banquet.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE MAKES A VISIT TO DERBY\r\n\r\nThe next important English function of His Royal Highness was a state\r\nvisit to Derby on December 17th. The announcement that the Prince and\r\nPrincess were coming to Chatsworth to stay with the Duke of Devonshire\r\nand would also visit Derby created much interest and on the appointed\r\nday brought great crowds from Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield,\r\nNottingham and Chesterfield to swell the population of the city. After\r\ndriving through the decorated streets and cheering crowds various loyal\r\naddresses were received and prizes presented at the City Grammar School.\r\nOn the evening of March 27th, 1873, the Prince presided at the annual\r\ndinner of the Railways' Benevolent Institution. In a somewhat lengthy\r\nlittle speech he explained its purposes and asked for aid in their\r\nattainment. The result was a subscription of five thousand guineas to\r\nwhich he himself contributed two hundred guineas.\r\n\r\nA duty which was congenial in one sense and sad in another was the\r\nunveiling of a statue of the late Prince Consort at the entrance of the\r\nHolborn Viaduct in London on January 9th, 1874. A luncheon followed in\r\nthe Guild Hall attended by some eight hundred guests and at which the\r\nPrince made a short speech. A few weeks later the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales were at St. Petersburg to attend the marriage of the Duke of\r\nEdinburgh with the Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia on January\r\n23rd. The marriage ceremony was performed in much state with the\r\nsuccessive rites of the Greek and English Churches--Dean Stanley\r\npresiding over the latter. Four future Sovereigns were present on the\r\noccasion, the Prince of Wales, the Crown Prince of Prussia, the\r\nCzarewitch of Russia and the Crown Prince of Denmark. During this visit\r\nthe Prince and Princess were treated with great distinction by the Czar\r\nand a grand military review was held in honour of His Royal Highness.\r\nThe anniversary festival of the British Orphan Asylum was attended on\r\nMarch 25th, in London, and a speech was made by His Royal Highness\r\nexplanatory of the useful objects of the institution. The subscriptions\r\nannounced during the evening amounted to £2400. An important incident of\r\nthe year was the visit of the Shah of Persia to England and the splendid\r\nentertainments given in honour of an Oriental Sovereign whose\r\nfriendliness was of serious import in the event of trouble between Great\r\nBritain and Russia. The Prince of Wales devoted considerable time to the\r\ntask of welcoming and entertaining the Royal visitor and gave one great\r\nbanquet, in particular, at Marlborough House which was remarkable for\r\nits effective magnificence.\r\n\r\nA dinner was given on March 31st by the Lord Mayor of London to\r\nMajor-General Sir Garnet Wolseley--afterward Field Marshal, Viscount\r\nWolseley--on his return from the successful Ashantee expedition and the\r\nPrince of Wales made a tactful speech on the occasion expressive of the\r\nthanks of the nation for the services of officers and men in that\r\narduous campaign. On April 22nd the Prince presided over a dinner in aid\r\nof the funds of the Royal Medical Benevolent Hospital. The leading men\r\nof the profession were present and, after a speech from the Prince,\r\ndonations of £1780 were announced by the Secretary with the usual one\r\nhundred guinea subscription from the Royal chairman. A different kind of\r\nfunction was His Royal Highness' attendance at a dinner of the Benchers\r\nof the Middle Temple on June 11th. The Master of the Temple, the Rev.\r\nDr. Vaughan, presided and others present were the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury and the Lord Chief Justice. The Prince, as a Bencher, wore\r\nthe silk gown of a Queen's Counsel as well as the riband of the Garter\r\nand made a brief speech in which he expressed the modest opinion that it\r\nwas a good thing for the profession at large that he had never been\r\ncalled to the Bar. On August 13th the new Municipal Buildings and Law\r\nCourts at Plymouth were opened by the Prince after a formal reception at\r\nthe hands of the Mayor and a procession through the artistically\r\ndecorated and densely packed streets of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST STATE VISIT TO BIRMINGHAM\r\n\r\nAn interesting event of this year and one which created considerable\r\ndiscussion and comment was the first state visit of the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales to Birmingham. For half a century that city had been a\r\ncentre of Radicalism, of extreme democratic opinion and, in earlier\r\ndays, of Chartist turbulence. The Mayor, in 1874, was Mr. Joseph\r\nChamberlain who was then noted for democratic views which were supposed\r\nin many quarters to extend to the full measure of republicanism. Doubt\r\nwas even expressed as to whether the Royal reception would be as cordial\r\nas might be desired or the Mayor as courteous, in the sense of loyal\r\nphraseology, as was customary. The visit took place on November 3rd and\r\na most cordial welcome was given by all classes of the people. Mr.\r\nChamberlain presented an address in the Town Hall and at a subsequent\r\nluncheon spoke of the Queen as \"having established claims to the\r\nadmiration of her people by the loyal fulfillment of responsible\r\nduties.\" In reference to this and other speeches which he made as\r\nchairman the London _Times_ of the succeeding day declared that\r\n\"whatever Mr. Chamberlain's views may be his speeches of yesterday\r\nappear to us to have been admirably worthy of the occasion and to have\r\ndone the highest credit to himself.\" They were described as being\r\ncouched in a line of \"courteous homage, manly independence and\r\ngentlemanly feeling.\"\r\n\r\nThe annual dinner of the Royal Cambridge Asylum was presided over by His\r\nRoyal Highness on March 13th, 1875; the Merchant Taylors' School in the\r\nCharterhouse was visited on April 6th; the German Hospital annual\r\nbanquet was presided over ten days later and donations of £5000 to its\r\nfunds announced during the evening--including one hundred guineas from\r\nthe Prince; the installation of the Heir Apparent as Grand Master of the\r\nEnglish Freemasons took place on April 28th. On June 5th he presided at\r\nthe yearly banquet of the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution for\r\nproviding pensions or annuities for persons ruined by agricultural\r\ndepression. The Earl of Hardwicke in proposing the Royal chairman's\r\nhealth said that \"the position of the Prince of Wales is not one of the\r\neasiest. He has no definite duties, but the duty he has laid down for\r\nhimself is of a very definite nature. It is to benefit, to the best of\r\nhis power, all his fellow-creatures.\" In the course of his speeches the\r\nPrince made an earnest appeal for aid to the purposes of the institution\r\nwith the result that £8000 was announced as the total donation of the\r\nevening--including the usual one hundred guineas from the chairman.\r\n\r\nThe next important event in his public life was the visit of the Prince\r\nto India in 1875-6. On his return the Royal traveller received many\r\ndemonstrations of popular esteem and the City of London entertained him\r\nat a great banquet and ball and an address of welcome, in a golden\r\ncasket of Indian design, was presented. During the remainder of the year\r\nthe Prince took a much-needed rest and interested himself largely in\r\nmatters local to his own county of Norfolk. He took in hand the\r\nnecessity existing at Norwich for a new Hospital and a large sum of\r\nmoney was soon subscribed for this purpose. Later in the year he visited\r\nGlasgow and laid the foundation of a new Post Office in that city. In\r\nthe spring of 1877 what may be termed the moral courage of the Prince\r\nwas put to a test in his invitation to preside at the annual banquet of\r\nthe Licensed Victuallers' Asylum. There were many protests made and at\r\nleast two hundred petitions presented urging His Royal Highness not to\r\npatronize or help the liquor interest. He decided, however, that the\r\ncharity was a useful one and the widows and orphans of licensed\r\nvictuallers as deserving of succour as those of other classes in the\r\ncommunity, and that he could quite well afford to patronize an\r\ninstitution in succession to his own father, the late Prince Consort.\r\nEarl Granville was present, three Bishops and many members of the Houses\r\nof Lords and Commons and the proceeds of the occasion were over £5000.\r\nIn one of his speeches the Royal chairman referred to the petitions\r\nreceived from Temperance Societies and remarked: \"I think this time they\r\nrather overstep the mark because the object of the meeting to-night is\r\nnot to encourage the love of drink but to support a good and excellent\r\ncharity.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in 1878 the Prince unveiled at Cambridge (on January 22nd) a\r\nstatue of his late father, who for years had been Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity. On June 28th, together with the Princess of Wales, he\r\nvisited the Infant Orphan Asylum at Wanstead and presided at the\r\nluncheon which followed and at which were Her Royal Highness, the Duke\r\nand Duchess of Manchester, the Bishop of St. Albans and Mrs. Claughton,\r\nand a large gathering. In his speech the Royal chairman reviewed the\r\nhistory of the institution and afterwards gave one hundred guineas to\r\nits funds. As a result of his interest in naval matters the Prince had\r\nalready placed his sons on the training ship _Britannia_ and, on July\r\n24th of this year, he and the Princess consented to distribute the\r\nannual prizes and medals. An address was presented from the City of\r\nDartmouth, on board the Royal yacht _Osborne_, which had been\r\naccompanied into the estuary of the River Dart by a large number of\r\nwar-ships, yachts, steam-launches and boats. Flags were flying\r\neverywhere on sea and shore and in the evening the illuminations were\r\nstriking. At the _Britannia_ the Royal visitors were received by Mr. W.\r\nH. Smith M.P. First Lord of the Admiralty and a distinguished gathering\r\namongst whom were Lord and Lady Charles Beresford and Sir Samuel and\r\nLady Baker. In his speech the Prince referred to the personal expression\r\nof confidence in the institution by the Princess and himself in sending\r\ntheir two sons to be trained there and expressed the hope that the\r\nlatter might do credit to the ship and to their country. A visit to\r\nDartmouth followed and then Prince Edward and Prince George were taken\r\nhome for their holidays.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF PRINCESS ALICE\r\n\r\nDuring this year the Heir Apparent had the misfortune to lose his\r\nmuch-loved sister the Princess Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse, to whose\r\ncareful nursing he had owed so much in his own serious illness and the\r\nsad features of whose death--as a result of nursing her children through\r\nan attack of malignant diphtheria--had proved such a shock to the\r\nBritish public. The Prince and Princess spent some months in retirement\r\nafter this occurrence and had also to mourn the death of the gallant\r\nyoung Prince Imperial of France, in whose career they had taken a deep\r\npersonal interest--not only on account of his loveable qualities, but\r\nbecause of the long friendship between the Royal house of England and\r\nthe widowed Empress Eugenie, to whose lonely hopes and pride the loss\r\nwas so terrible. The Prince of Wales helped the stricken lady in the\r\ndetails of the funeral, acted as the principal pall-bearer and showed\r\nhis sympathy in many ways, of which the wreath of violets sent from\r\nMarlborough, with the following inscription, was an incident: \"A token\r\nof affection and regard for him who lived the most spotless of lives and\r\ndied a soldier's death fighting for our cause in Zululand. From Albert\r\nEdward and Alexandra, July 12, 1879.\" His Royal Highness strongly\r\nsupported the proposal to erect a Memorial in Westminster Abbey, but\r\neven his great influence could not overcome the international prejudices\r\nwhich the suggestion aroused and he had to wait till January, 1883, when\r\nthe \"United Service Memorial\" was erected at Woolwich, and, accompanied\r\nby his two sons and the Dukes of Edinburgh and Cambridge, he was able to\r\nunveil the statue and fittingly eulogize the Royal French youth who had\r\nfought and died for the country which had been so kind to his parents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN ALEXANDRA\r\n  The Queen Consort of Edward VII]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF EDWARD, PRINCE OF WALES, AT\r\nBRUSSELS, APRIL, 1900]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLEET STREET, LONDON\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most interesting thoroughfares of London. On all\r\ngreat state occasions it is beautifully and lavishly decorated. In the\r\ndistance is seen the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, where a great\r\nmemorial service was held, attended by the Corporation of London, great\r\nnumbers of officials and great throngs of mourning people.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. GEORGE'S CHAPEL, WINDSOR]\r\n\r\nOn May 5th, 1879, the Prince of Wales presided at the annual banquet of\r\nthe Cabdrivers' Benevolent Association. On May 23, 1880, he presided at\r\na dinner in aid of the funds of the Princess Helena College and the\r\nresult of his patronage and the careful speech delivered was a total\r\ndonation of £2000, to which he contributed his customary one hundred\r\nguineas. On June 17th of the same year he visited the new Breakwater and\r\nHarbour at Holyhead and, during the visit, there were loyal\r\ndemonstrations on sea and land and a banquet attended by gentlemen\r\nrepresenting most of the leading English and Irish railway companies.\r\nDuring the same month the King of Greece visited England and the Prince\r\nhad an opportunity of returning some of the many hospitalities which he\r\nhad received from His Majesty and of presenting him to the Corporation\r\nof London at a great banquet of welcome. As Duke of Cornwall he also\r\nlaid the first stone of Truro Cathedral in this month. Writing of this\r\nand other functions on June 18th the _Times_ declared that the\r\nrepresentative duties of British royalty were heavier than the private\r\nfunctions of the hardest-worked Englishman. \"In these scenes and a\r\nhundred like them a Prince's function cannot be discharged\r\nsatisfactorily unless he be at once an impersonation of Royal state and,\r\nwhat is harder still, his own individual self. He must act his public\r\ncharacter as if he enjoyed the festival as much as any of the\r\nspectators. He must be able to stamp a national impress upon the\r\nsolemnity yet mark its local and particular significance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTES PRIZES, PRESENTS AND COLOURS\r\n\r\nNew colours were presented to the Royal Welsh Fusiliers by the Prince as\r\nthey were embarking from Portsmouth for India, on August 16th. On May\r\n24th, 1881, he presided at the festival dinner of the Royal Hospital for\r\nWomen and Children in London, contributed one hundred guineas to its\r\nfunds and was able to announce donations totalling £2000. At King's\r\nCollege, London, on July 2nd, His Royal Highness, accompanied by the\r\nPrincess, distributed the annual prizes and pointed out the history and\r\nmerits of the institution. On July 18th the Prince, accompanied by the\r\nPrincess of Wales, laid the foundation of a City and Guilds of London\r\nInstitute, established for the technical training of artisans, and\r\ndelivered a speech of considerable range and length. He also accepted\r\nthe Presidency of the Institute. The seventh annual meeting of the\r\nInternational Medical Congress was formally opened by the Prince,\r\naccompanied by the Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia, on August 3rd. He\r\nwas received by a Committee composed of distinguished medical men such\r\nas Sir W. Jenner, Sir William Gull, Sir James Paget and Sir J. R.\r\nBennett and, during the ceremony, spoke upon the progress made in late\r\nyears by medical science.\r\n\r\nThe death of Dean Stanley on July 18th of this year was felt as a\r\npersonal and severe loss by both the Prince and Princess. The former had\r\nno warmer or wiser friend; the latter no greater admirer in the highest\r\nsense of the word. It was fitting, therefore, that His Royal Highness\r\nshould take the lead in raising a suitable Memorial to the distinguished\r\nChurchman and he attended and spoke earnestly at a meeting called in the\r\nChapter-house of Westminster Abbey, for that purpose, on December 13th.\r\nDean Bradley presided and there were also present Archbishop Tait of\r\nCanterbury, the Marquess of Salisbury, Earl Granville, the Duke of\r\nWestminster, the Marquess of Lorne, Mr. J. Russell Lowell, the American\r\nMinister, Lord Chief Justice Coleridge and others. In his speech the\r\nPrince spoke of his intimate friendship with Dean Stanley over a period\r\nof twenty-two years, of their association in the East and of the great\r\ncharm of his companionship. \"As the Churchman, as the scholar, as the\r\nman of letters, as the philanthropist and, above all, as the true\r\nfriend, his name must always go down to posterity as a great and good\r\nman and as one who will make his mark on a chapter of his country's\r\nhistory.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years the public events of the Prince's career\r\ncontinued along very much the same lines, varied by some rapid trip to\r\nthe continent, or visit to the country home of some noble friend, or a\r\nshooting excursion to some place where game was plentiful and companions\r\ncongenial. The central events, aside from his promotion of the Fisheries\r\nand other Exhibitions, were the visit to Ireland in 1885, the support\r\ngiven to an Empire policy by his patronage of the Imperial Institute and\r\nsimilar concerns, his active connection with the Masonic Order and his\r\nconduct of the Jubilee of 1887. The International Fisheries Exhibition\r\ngrew out of a comparatively small affair at Norwich in which the Prince\r\nof Wales had taken an active interest. In July 1881, as a result of his\r\ninitiative, a meeting was held in London, a committee was formed and the\r\npreliminary work done. In February 1882 a second meeting occurred and\r\nfurther organization was effected with the Queen as Patron, His Royal\r\nHighness as President and the Duke of Richmond as Chairman of the\r\nGeneral Committee. The Exhibition was finally opened on May 13, 1883, by\r\nthe Prince of Wales, who had around him most of the members of the Royal\r\nfamily, the Foreign Ambassadors, Her Majesty's Ministers and other\r\ndistinguished persons, His address defined the reasons for the\r\nenterprise in a sentence: \"In view of the rapid increase of the\r\npopulation in all civilized countries, and especially in these sea girt\r\nkingdoms, a profound interest attaches to every industry which affects\r\nthe supply of food; and in this respect the harvest of the sea is hardly\r\nless important than that of the land.\" In results he thought the\r\nExhibition should enable practical fishermen to acquaint themselves with\r\nthe latest improvements in both their working craft and life-saving\r\nsystems. It was a great success. The total visitors numbered 2,703,051\r\nand there was a financial surplus of £15,243. Of this, two-thirds was\r\nput aside to assist the families of fishermen who had lost their lives\r\nat sea, and £3000 was used to organize a Fisheries Society in order to\r\nkeep up the interest in the subject and encourage the study of ways and\r\nmeans to help the fishermen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE ENCOURAGES EXHIBITIONS\r\n\r\nIn replying to an address from the Executive Committee at the closing of\r\nthe Exhibition, on October 31st, the Prince had suggested that other\r\nExhibitions might very well be held dealing with the three great\r\nsubjects of Health, Inventions and the Colonies. The first subject dealt\r\nwith was that of Health. Owing to the death of his brother, the Duke of\r\nAlbany, on March 28th, 1884, the Prince could not do much more than\r\ninitiate the project but it was carried on by the Duke of Buckingham as\r\nChairman of the Committee. Its active progress was marked by the\r\ninauguration of the work of the International Juries by the Prince of\r\nWales on June 17th. Like the Fisheries and the \"Colinderies\" which\r\nfollowed it in 1886, the \"Healtheries\" proved ultimately a great\r\nsuccess. Meanwhile, minor incidents were occurring. On March 1st, 1882,\r\nas Colonel of the Corps, the Prince presided over the 21st anniversary\r\ndinner of the Civil Service Volunteers and spoke at some length upon the\r\nimportance of the Volunteer force. Others present on the occasion were\r\nthe Dukes of Manchester and Portland, Viscount Bury, Lord Elcho and\r\nColonel Lloyd-Lindsay. On March 10th, 1883, the Duke of Cambridge,\r\nCommander-in-Chief, called a meeting in London to consider what could be\r\ndone with the neglected British graves in the Crimea and the Prince of\r\nWales, who had felt the matter keenly during his visit of years before,\r\nmoved a Resolution declaring that immediate steps should be taken in the\r\nmatter. He spoke with earnestness, contributed £50 toward the project\r\nand was supported by General Sir W. Codrington, Admiral Sir H. Keppel,\r\nGeneral Sir L. A. Simmons and Lord Wolseley.\r\n\r\nThe new City School of London, on the Thames Embankment, was opened by\r\nHis Royal Highness on December 12th, 1882, accompanied by the Princess\r\nof Wales. On May 21st 1883 crowded memories of his Indian tour were\r\nrevived by the opening of the Northbrook Club for the use of Native\r\ngentlemen from the East Indies. In his speech the Prince referred with\r\ngratitude to his \"magnificent reception\" in India and expressed his\r\nstrong approval of the establishment of a place where natives of that\r\nEmpire could meet together for purposes of relaxation and intercourse.\r\nThe City of London College, intended chiefly for young men who could\r\nonly attend evening classes, was inaugurated on July 8th of this year.\r\nThe Princess was also present. In the House of Lords on February 22nd,\r\n1884, the Prince made one of his very few speeches in that\r\nChamber--although a frequent attendant at its sessions. It was in\r\nconnection with a motion presented by Lord Salisbury for the appointment\r\nof a Royal Commission to inquire into the housing of the working\r\nclasses. His Royal Highness declared that a searching inquiry was very\r\nnecessary, expressed his pleasure at having been named a member of the\r\nCommission, referred to his own experiments at Sandringham, and\r\nexpressed the hope that measures of a drastic and thorough kind would\r\nresult. Three days later, accompanied by the Princess, their three\r\ndaughters, and Her Royal Highness the Marchioness of Lorne, the Prince\r\nof Wales visited the Guards' Industrial Home at Chelsea Barracks and\r\ndistributed the annual prizes.\r\n\r\nOn March 15th, not for the first time, he presided at the annual meeting\r\nof the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and spoke strongly of its\r\nvaluable and important work. Other speakers were the Dukes of Argyll and\r\nNorthumberland, Admiral Keppel and Lord C. Beresford. The Guilds of\r\nLondon Institute was opened on June 25th and the speech made by the\r\nPrince was more elaborate than usual. He was well supported by Lord\r\nCarlingford and Mr. A. J. Mundella, M.P. An important and interesting\r\nincident of this year was the action of the Prince of Wales in presiding\r\nover a densely-crowded meeting in the Guild Hall, London, called to\r\ncelebrate the Jubilee of the abolition of slavery in British countries\r\nand to consider the past and present work of the Anti-Slavery Society.\r\nOn the platform were many distinguished men in every sphere of the\r\nnational life and the speech of His Royal Highness was probably the\r\nlongest he had ever delivered. It was a succinct history of the\r\nabolition of slavery in various countries and colonies and contained\r\nmany expressions of warm approval toward those who had worked to that\r\nend--the extension of \"the sacred principle of freedom.\" Sir Stafford\r\nNorthcote, Archbishop Benson of Canterbury, Mr. W. E. Forster, M.P.,\r\nCardinal Manning and others spoke, and it was afterwards announced by\r\nthe Lord Mayor that the Prince had consented to become Patron of the\r\nBritish and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society.\r\n\r\nThe unveiling of the statue of Charles Darwin in the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory on June 9th, 1885, evoked a brief speech and a reference to \"the\r\ngreat Englishman who had exerted so vast an influence upon the progress\r\nof branches of natural knowledge.\" On July 4th the Prince and Princess\r\nattended the opening of the new building of the Birkbeck Institution in\r\nLondon and the former spoke upon its objects and character. On July 5th\r\nof the previous year he presided at the annual dinner in aid of the\r\nRailway Guards' Friendly Society and referred in his speech to its\r\nnature and valuable work. More than £3300 was subscribed, to which the\r\nRoyal chairman gave his usual contribution. The Convalescent Home at\r\nSwanley was opened on July 13th 1885 and the Prince was accompanied by\r\nhis wife and daughters. A visit was paid two days later to Leeds and the\r\nPrince and Princess stayed at Studley, the seat of the Marquess of\r\nRipon. Various addresses were received at the Town Hall and from thence\r\nthe Royal visitors went to the Yorkshire College, which the Prince duly\r\ninaugurated amid much state. At the succeeding luncheon he spoke of the\r\ngreat importance of the industrial educational work which this\r\ninstitution was carrying on. \"I have for a long time been deeply\r\nimpressed with the advisability of establishing in our great centres of\r\npopulation, colleges and schools, not only for promoting the\r\nintellectual advancement of the people, but also for increasing their\r\nprosperity by furthering the application of scientific knowledge to the\r\nindustrial arts.\"\r\n\r\nThe sad news of the gallant death of General Gordon affected the Prince\r\nof Wales as only the loss of a friend who is greatly and personally\r\nadmired can do. He took much interest in the Committee which was formed\r\nto promote a Memorial and finally summoned a special meeting at\r\nMarlborough House, on January 12th, 1886, to promote the collection of a\r\nfund looking to the permanent establishment of a Gordon Boys' Home.\r\nSpeeches were made by General Higginson, the Duke of Cambridge and Lord\r\nNapier of Magdala, and ultimately the enterprise was fairly placed upon\r\nits feet. A little later, with Prince Albert Victor and Prince George,\r\nHis Royal Highness went to stay with the Duke of Westminster at Eaton\r\nHall. From thence, on January 20th, they visited Liverpool and the\r\nMersey Tunnel was formally inaugurated after a drive through the city\r\nand the reception of the usual addresses and popular welcome. A banquet\r\nwas also received and several speeches made by the Prince. The\r\nInstitution of Civil Engineers entertained the Prince of Wales at dinner\r\non March 27th and the Royal guest was accompanied by his eldest son and\r\nthe Duke of Cambridge. Sir Frederick Bramwell presided. On June 28th,\r\nfollowing, he laid the foundation-stone of the Peoples' Palace amidst\r\nevidences of unbounded personal popularity in the East End of London;\r\nwith ten thousand people around him--including one thousand delegates\r\nfrom the various Trade, Friendly and Temperance Societies in East\r\nLondon; and with representative persons in attendance such as Dr. Adler,\r\nthe Chief Rabbi, Cardinal Manning, Archbishop Benson and Mr. Walter\r\nBesant.\r\n\r\nAs a result of his deep and practical interest in agricultural matters\r\nthe Prince of Wales held a sale of Shorthorn cattle and Southdown sheep\r\nat Norwich on July 15th of this year. The sale was a most interesting\r\nand successful event from a technical as well as general standpoint and\r\nfully proved the right of the Royal owner of Sandringham to be called a\r\nfarmer and to act as President of the Royal Agricultural Society of\r\nEngland. A luncheon given to the agricultural celebrities of England\r\nfollowed the sale. On March 12th, 1887, the Prince presided at the\r\nJubilee banquet of the London Orphan Asylum and defined its objects and\r\nwork while urging more financial assistance to its projects. Amongst\r\nthose present were the Duke of Abercorn, the Earl of Clarendon, General\r\nSir Donald Stewart and Sir Dighton Probyn. The subscriptions announced\r\nduring the evening were £5000, including one hundred guineas from the\r\nPrince.\r\n\r\nOn March 30th he opened the new College of Preceptors in London,\r\naccompanied by the Princess of Wales and the Princesses Victoria and\r\nMaud. The opening of the Manchester Exhibition followed on May 3rd and\r\nthe Prince and Princesses came to the city from Tatton Hall, where they\r\nhad been staying with Lord Egerton. The usual hearty welcome was given\r\nalong the crowded route. On May 22nd the London Hospital's new buildings\r\nwere inaugurated, the Prince being accompanied by his wife and two\r\ndaughters and the Crown Prince of Denmark. Six days later Tottenham was\r\nvisited and the new portion of the Deaconesses Institution and Hospital\r\nopened. The Shaftesbury House, or home for shelterless boys, was\r\ninaugurated on June 17th and on November 3rd His Royal Highness visited\r\nTruro, accompanied by the Princess and his two sons, attended the\r\nconsecration of the new Cathedral by the Primate of England and spoke\r\nafterwards at a luncheon given by the principal residents of the Duchy\r\nof Cornwall. On the following day he presented new colours to the Duke\r\nof Cornwall's Light Infantry at Devonport.\r\n\r\nOn May the 8th, 1888, the Prince and Princess of Wales opened the\r\nGlasgow Exhibition and the former spoke interestingly of the industrial\r\ndevelopment of the time. The statesman whose advice and knowledge had\r\nbeen so greatly appreciated by the Prince during his Indian tour was\r\nfittingly commemorated by the statue on the Thames Embankment which His\r\nRoyal Highness unveiled on June 5th following. Sir Bartle Frere was\r\ndescribed in the speech accompanying the act as \"a great and valued\r\npublic servant of the Crown and a highly esteemed and dear friend of\r\nmyself.\" On July 6th a new Gymnasium for the Young Men's Christian\r\nAssociation was opened in London; on May 9th the Prince and Princess\r\nvisited Blackburn and were enthusiastically received; on May 14th His\r\nRoyal Highness, accompanied by his wife and daughters, Prince Charles of\r\nDenmark and Prince George of Greece, opened the Anglo-Danish Exhibition\r\nat South Kensington; on July 17th he inaugurated the new buildings of\r\nthe Great Northern Hospital at Islington and in the autumn of the year\r\npaid a visit to Austria and some of the countries in Southern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe purely public events of following years may be briefly and partially\r\nsummarized. In June, 1889, the Prince and Princess of Wales visited the\r\nParis Exhibition in a semi-private capacity, and were present at Athens,\r\non October 27th, at the wedding of the Duke of Sparta and Princess\r\nSophia of Germany. The great Forth Bridge was opened by the Prince in\r\nMarch, 1890, and a short time spent with Lord Rosebery at Dalmeny; a\r\nvisit was paid to Berlin, accompanied by Prince George, on March 21st; a\r\nstatue of the Duke of Albany was unveiled at Cannes on April 6th; a new\r\nnave in the ancient Church of St. Saviour, Southwark, was inaugurated on\r\nJuly 24th; the new Town Hall at Portsmouth was opened on August 9th; the\r\nCity of London Electric Railway was inaugurated on November 4th. On\r\nNovember 9th, 1891, the theatrical managers of London presented His\r\nRoyal Highness with a large gold cigar-box in honour of his fiftieth\r\nbirthday. In 1892 the Prince visited the Royal Agricultural Society at\r\nWarwick with the Duke of York, laid the foundation-stone of the\r\nClarence Memorial addition to St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington, and\r\nsupervised the re-building of Sandringham after the fire which had\r\nconsumed a portion of it. One of the events of 1894 was a visit to\r\nCoburg in April and attendance at the marriage of his niece and nephew,\r\nthe Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and the Grand Duke of Hesse.\r\nAnother was the opening of the Tower Bridge, London, in June, by the\r\nPrince and Princess on behalf of the Queen.\r\n\r\nOn May 16, 1895, the Prince of Wales reviewed the Warwickshire Yeomanry;\r\non July 8th he laid the foundation-stone of new buildings at the Epsom\r\nMedical College; in July he reviewed Italian and British fleets off\r\nPortsmouth; on July 22nd he opened the new building of the Royal Free\r\nHospital, Grey's Inn Road, London; in November he presided at a lecture\r\nin the Imperial Institute. In 1896 he was formally installed as\r\nChancellor of the University of Wales, and stayed at Balmoral in\r\nSeptember during the visit of the Emperor and Empress of Russia to the\r\nQueen. In January, 1897, the Prince visited the Duke of Sutherland at\r\nTrentham Hall; on May 22nd he opened the Blackwell Tunnel; in June he\r\nparticipated in all the Jubilee functions, was created Grand Master of\r\nthe Order of the Bath and gave a banquet, in honour of the appointment,\r\nto all living Knights Grand Cross of the Order, which was a unique\r\ngathering of men distinguished in diplomacy, statesmanship, in the Army\r\nand Navy, and in Imperial and civil administration. During the following\r\nyear he distributed prizes in June at Wellington College and laid the\r\nfoundation-stone of new buildings at University College Hospital; on\r\nDecember 23rd he attended the opening service of a restored church at\r\nSherbourne. On June 19, 1899, His Royal Highness held a Levée at St.\r\nJames's Palace; on July 6th he received the freedom of the City of\r\nEdinburgh; and on September 18th he presented new colours to the Gordon\r\nHighlanders.\r\n\r\nSuch was the general character and scope of the Prince's public life.\r\nThere would have been little object served in elaborating the\r\ndescription of these ceremonial events. They are of value and necessary\r\nto a clear comprehension of the position and manifold duties of the\r\nPrince of Wales, and quite enough have been given for this purpose.\r\nDuring all these thirty years the work of the Heir Apparent increased in\r\nits importance and multifarious character until every interest and\r\nelement in the population found a place in its performance. It was\r\narduous and unceasing, but the Prince never showed weariness and always\r\nappeared with the same unaffected _bonhomie_ and natural dignity\r\nwhatever the extent of his work or the character of the function. The\r\nend of it all was a popularity as unique as it was thoroughly and well\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSpecial Functions and Interests\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales' connection with the Masonic Order was an early one\r\nand had always been a close and sincerely interested one. He was first\r\ninitiated in 1868 by the late King of Sweden when staying at Stockholm.\r\nHe served several terms as Worshipful Master of the Royal Alpha Lodge,\r\nwhich consisted of a number of Grand Officers, generally noblemen, and\r\nin this lodge he personally initiated his eldest son, the late Duke of\r\nClarence and Avondale, in 1885. He was also permanent Master of the\r\nPrince of Wales Lodge, to which he initiated the Duke of Connaught in\r\n1874. When the Marquess of Ripon retired from the Grand Mastership of\r\nEnglish Freemasons in 1875 the Prince of Wales accepted the post and was\r\ninstalled on April 28th at the Royal Albert Hall. The function was\r\nperhaps the most memorable and imposing in the British history of the\r\nOrder. In the vast Hall there were more than ten thousand members of the\r\ncraft, of all ranks and degrees, and in costume suited to their Masonic\r\nconditions. Many distinguished visitors and deputations from foreign\r\nlodges were present in the reserved inclosure. The Earl of Carnarvon\r\nperformed the initial ceremonies and in the address to His Royal\r\nHighness referred to the gathering around them: \"I may truly say that\r\nnever in the whole history of Freemasonry has such a Grand Lodge been\r\nconvened as that on which my eye rests at this moment and there is,\r\nfurther, an inner view to be taken, that so far as my eyes can carry me\r\nover these serried ranks of white and blue, and gold and purple, I\r\nrecognize in them men who have solemnly taken obligations of worth and\r\nmorality--men who have undertaken the duties of citizens and the loyalty\r\nof subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE'S ADDRESS AS MASONIC GRAND MASTER\r\n\r\nIn his reply the Prince expressed an \"ardent and sincere wish\" to follow\r\nin the footsteps of his predecessors and the belief that, so long as\r\nFreemasons did not mix themselves up in politics, \"this high and noble\r\nOrder will flourish and will maintain the integrity of our great\r\nEmpire.\" After deputations had been received from the Grand Lodges of\r\nScotland, Ireland, Sweden and Denmark the new Grand Master appointed\r\nLord Carnarvon to be Pro-Grand-Master, Lord Skelmersdale to be Deputy\r\nGrand Master and the Marquess of Hamilton and the Lord Mayor of London\r\nto two other chief offices. In the evening a grand banquet was held at\r\nwhich he presided and made several tactful speeches. The Duke of\r\nConnaught, the Duke of Manchester, the late Earl of Rosslyn and the\r\nrepresentatives of various Grand Lodges also spoke. On July 1st, 1886,\r\nHis Royal Highness was installed as Grand Master of the Mark Master\r\nMasons in the presence of more than one thousand Grand, Past and\r\nProvincial Officers from India and the Colonies as well as from the\r\nUnited Kingdom. The Earl of Kintore presided in the early stages of the\r\nfunction and was afterwards appointed Pro-Grand Master, with Lord\r\nEgerton of Tatton as Deputy Grand Master and the Duke of Connaught as\r\nSenior Grand Warden.\r\n\r\nDuring the Queen's Jubilee, on June 13th, 1887, it was decided to\r\npresent an address to Her Majesty as Patron of the Order and of various\r\nMasonic charities. The formal action was taken at an immense gathering\r\nin the Royal Albert Hall, on the date mentioned, when some seven\r\nthousand officers and members, representatives of the Lodges of the\r\nEmpire met and passed a Resolution to that effect. His Royal Highness\r\nthe Grand Master, who was accompanied by Prince Albert Victor and the\r\nDuke of Connaught, presided and was able to announce, after this part of\r\nthe business had been disposed of and the National Anthem sung with\r\nenthusiasm, that £6000 had that day been paid in by members and was to\r\nbe entirely devoted to Masonic charities for the children and the aged.\r\nTwo years later, on July 6, 1888, and in the same place, the Prince of\r\nWales presided over the centennial banquet of the Royal Masonic\r\nInstitute for Girls. With him were the King of Sweden and Norway, Prince\r\nAlbert Victor, the Earls of Carnarvon, Lathom and Zetland, Lord Egerton\r\nof Tatton, Lord Leigh and many other eminent Masons. One of the speeches\r\nof the Chairman was devoted to a history of the institution they were\r\ntrying to help and to a request for funds to erect additional buildings\r\nand better accommodations. The response afterwards announced to the\r\nappeal, made before and at this dinner, was £50,472 of which London\r\ncontributed £22,454 and the Provinces, India and the Colonies the\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PATRON OF ART\r\n\r\nAnother subject in which the Prince always took a great and active\r\ninterest was that of Art--especially as embodied in the work of the\r\nRoyal Academy. His first appearance in this connection was at the annual\r\nbanquet on May 4th, 1863, and it has been noted that at the various\r\nsubsequent occasions of this kind at which he spoke, despite the\r\nsameness of the toasts and subjects, there was always fresh material in\r\nhis remarks. At the banquet on May 5th, 1866, Sir Francis Grant presided\r\nfor the first time as President and amongst the speakers besides His\r\nRoyal Highness were his brother Prince Alfred, the Duke of Cambridge,\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury, Earl Russell and the Earl of Derby. In\r\n1867 and in 1870 he also spoke and on the latter occasion the speakers\r\nincluded Mr. J. Lothrop Motley, the American Minister, and Charles\r\nDickens. At the banquet in 1871 the Prince spoke and at that of 1874 he\r\ndrew special attention to the picture, \"Calling the Roll,\" which\r\nafterwards made Miss Elizabeth Thompson so famous, and to a statue by J.\r\nE. Boehm which was the beginning of that sculptor's rise to distinction.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales was again present in May, 1875 and then, owing to\r\nother pressing engagements, missed four years. At the annual banquet on\r\nMay 3rd, 1879, which he attended, Sir Frederick Leighton was President\r\nof the Academy and the Prince made kindly allusion to the memory of his\r\nlate predecessor. Amongst the other speakers were Lord Beaconsfield, Mr.\r\nW. H. Smith and Lord Chief Justice Cockburn. At the banquet in 1880, Sir\r\nF. Leighton paid his Royal guest an unusual compliment: \"Sir, of the\r\ngraces by which Your Royal Highness has won and firmly retains the\r\naffectionate attachment of Englishmen none has operated more strongly\r\nthan the width of your sympathies; for there is no honourable sphere in\r\nwhich Englishmen move, no path of life in which they tread, wherein Your\r\nRoyal Highness has not, at some time, by graceful word or deed, evinced\r\nan enlightened interest.\" In 1881, the central subject of toast and\r\nspeech was Sir Frederick Roberts, who had come fresh from the fields of\r\nCabul and Candahar; but the Prince of Wales did not forget an illusion\r\nto the death of \"that great statesman\" the Earl of Beaconsfield. In 1885\r\nHis Royal Highness was accompanied for the first time by Prince Albert\r\nVictor and in 1888 he was able to refer to the fact of this occasion\r\nbeing not only the year of his silver wedding but the year which marked\r\na quarter of a century since his first appearance amongst them.\r\n\r\nThe Corporation of Trinity House, which in the time of Henry VIII. had\r\nbeen a guild for the encouragement of the art and science of navigation\r\nand had latterly come into the work of building lighthouses and\r\nprotecting ships along the coasts of England, was always an object of\r\ninterest and support to the Prince of Wales. In 1865 he declined the\r\npost of Master--which had been held by men like Lord Liverpool, the Duke\r\nof Wellington, the Prince Consort and Lord Palmerston--in favour of his\r\nbrother the Sailor Prince. He attended the next annual banquet, however,\r\ntogether with the King of the Belgians, and two years later was\r\ninstalled as one of the \"Younger Brethren\" of Trinity House. The Duke of\r\nRichmond and Lord Napier of Magdala were amongst the other speakers. The\r\nbanquet of July 4th, 1869 was especially interesting from the eminent\r\nmen of all parties whom it brought together. The Prince of Wales\r\npresided, in the absence of the Duke of Edinburgh, and the speakers\r\nincluded Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Bright, Mr. Disraeli, Sir Stafford Northcote\r\nand Sir John Burgoyne. He again attended and addressed the banquet of\r\nTrinity House on June 24, 1871, and presided at that of June 27, 1874.\r\nHis speech upon the latter occasion contained various important facts\r\nand opinions upon the improvement of navigation facilities. At the\r\ndinner in 1877 the Prince again presided and in the proposing his health\r\nthe late Earl of Derby said: \"His Royal Highness has not only now, but\r\nfor many years past done all that is in the power of man to do, by\r\ngenial courtesies towards men of every class and by his indefatigable\r\nassiduity in the performance of every social duty, to secure at once\r\nthat public respect which is due to his exalted position and that social\r\nsympathy and personal popularity which no position, however exalted, can\r\nof itself be sufficient to secure.\" The most interesting event of this\r\noccasion was the presence and very brief soldierly speech of General U.\r\nS. Grant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NOTABLE GROUP OF ROYAL RELATIONS PHOTOGRAPHED IN KING\r\nEDWARD'S HOME\r\n  King Edward         Emperor of Germany   Queen Alexandra\r\n  King of Spain       Queen of Spain       Empress of Germany\r\n  Queen of Portugal   Queen of Norway]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING EDWARD VII\r\n  In Highland Garb]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE GENERATIONS OF ENGLISH SOVEREIGNS\r\n  King Edward VII, seated between his son King George V and his\r\n  grandson Edward, heir apparent to the throne]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MAUSOLEUM FROGMORE, WINDSOR]\r\n\r\nThe encouragement of Musical education and the promotion of a public\r\ntaste for music was one of the subjects in which the Prince of Wales\r\ntook a deep and practical interest. He believed in the humanizing and\r\ncivilizing effects of music and felt that amongst a people who had made\r\na home for Händel and who had in older days loved glees and madrigals\r\nand choral compositions there was room, in a more hum-drum age, for the\r\nencouragement of popular taste in this direction. The Royal Academy of\r\nMusic, founded in 1822, had done some good but limited service and, in\r\n1875, he placed himself at the head of a movement to further the love\r\nand practice of music amongst the people. A meeting was held at\r\nMarlborough House on June 15th for the immediate purpose of establishing\r\nfree scholarships in connection with the proposed National Training\r\nSchools for Music, near the Royal Albert Hall, and there were present\r\nthe Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Christian, the Duke of Teck, the\r\nArchbishops of Canterbury and York, the Lord Mayor of London and many\r\nProvincial Mayors, and a numerous company distinguished by public\r\nreputation or position. The result of this action was most successful,\r\nand in 1878, the Prince endeavoured to complete it by bringing the\r\nAcademy and the Training Schools into union.\r\n\r\n\r\nENCOURAGES MUSICAL EDUCATION\r\n\r\nFailing in this, however, he presided on February 28th 1882 at a meeting\r\nin St. James's Palace held for the purpose of founding a \"Royal College\r\nof Music\" and attended by one of the most representative gatherings\r\nwhich His Royal Highness had ever brought together. His speech was an\r\nable and elaborate statement of the importance of a national cultivation\r\nof music and the necessity for its promotion in the United Kingdom. \"Why\r\nis it,\" he asked, \"that England has no music recognized as national? It\r\nhas able composers but nothing indicative of the national life or\r\nnational feeling. The reason is not far to seek. There is no centre of\r\nmusic to which English musicians may resort with confidence and thence\r\nderive instruction, counsel and inspiration.\" The plan was then clearly\r\noutlined and enthusiastically accepted--Lord Rosebery, Mr. Gladstone\r\nand Sir Stafford Northcote being amongst those who spoke and supported\r\nthe project presented by the Royal chairman. A little later, on March\r\n23rd, the Prince invited a number of gentlemen connected with the\r\nColonial part of the Empire to meet him at Marlborough House in order to\r\ndiscuss how best the benefits of the College might be extended and\r\napplied to the more distant British countries.\r\n\r\nOn May 7th, 1883, the Royal College of Music was formally inaugurated\r\nafter an effort amongst its supporters which had included the holding of\r\nforty-four public meetings throughout the country. With the Prince of\r\nWales were present the Princess, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the\r\nPrincess Christian and the Trustees, amongst whom were the Duke of\r\nWestminster, Sir Richard Wallace, M.P., Sir George Grove and Sir John\r\nRose. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Mr. Gladstone and many others were\r\nalso present. The Royal founder of the institution spoke at unusual\r\nlength, referred to the teaching and examining powers of the College,\r\nasked for aid in establishing scholarships and extending its usefulness\r\nand dilated upon the importance of the objects aimed at. \"I trust that\r\nthe College will become the recognized centre and head of the musical\r\nworld in this country. Music is, in the best sense, the most popular of\r\nall arts. If that government be the best which provides for the\r\nhappiness of the greatest number, that art must be the best which at the\r\nleast expense pleases the greatest number.\" The project proved most\r\nsuccessful and the Royal College of Music became one of the recognized\r\ninstitutions of the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT TO IRELAND IN 1885\r\n\r\nThe Royal visit to Ireland in 1885 was an important incident in the\r\npublic life of the Prince of Wales. It was seventeen years since he and\r\nthe Princess had visited that much-troubled country and many untoward\r\nevents had occurred since then. The proposal for another visit was not\r\npopular with a section of the Irish press and politicians, but when it\r\nwas evident that the generous instincts of the Irish people were going\r\nto make the occasion a demonstration of kindly feeling, if not of\r\nloyalty after the English fashion, they changed their attitude and\r\nrecommended a \"dignified neutrality.\" Even this advice was very largely,\r\nhowever, lost sight of in the eventual result. On April 9th the Royal\r\ncouple, accompanied by Prince Albert Victor, arrived at Kingstown amid\r\nthe usual decorations and crowds and accepted an address of welcome. In\r\nDublin the address was presented by the City Reception Committee instead\r\nof by the Lord Mayor and Corporation. An important clause in this\r\ndocument to which the Prince made no reference in his cautious reply was\r\nas follows: \"We venture to assure you that it would be a great\r\ngratification to Her Majesty's loyal subjects in Ireland if a permanent\r\nRoyal residence should be established in our country.\" A visit was paid\r\nat the conclusion of these proceedings to the Royal Dublin Society and\r\nthe Agricultural Show.\r\n\r\nLater in the day the Prince, attended only by his eldest son and without\r\nnotice of his intention, visited some of the poorest parts of the city\r\nand saw for himself the condition of the people. It soon became known,\r\nhowever, that he was amongst them and hearty cheers were given him\r\nwherever the people caught a glimpse of their visitor. On the following\r\nday thirty different addresses were received from various public bodies\r\nand in replying to them the Prince said: \"In varied capacities and by\r\nwidely different paths you pursue those great objects which, dear to\r\nyou, are, believe me, dear also to me--the prosperity and progress of\r\nIreland, the welfare and happiness of her people. From my heart I wish\r\nyou success and I would that time and my own powers would permit me to\r\nexplain fully and in detail the deep interest which I feel not only in\r\nthe welfare of this great Empire at large but in the true happiness of\r\nthose several classes of the community on whose behalf you have come\r\nhere to-day.\" The next event was the laying of the foundation stone of\r\nthe new Museum of Science and Art. The route was densely thronged, the\r\nhouses beautifully decorated and the cheers of the people enthusiastic.\r\nAn appropriate speech was made and then the Prince and his wife and son,\r\naccompanied by the Lord Lieutenant and Countess Spencer, drove to the\r\nRoyal University where they were received by the Chancellor, the Duke of\r\nAbercorn, and the Honorary degree of LL. D. bestowed upon the Prince and\r\nthat of Doctor of Music upon the Princess.\r\n\r\nSucceeding incidents of the visit were a brilliant Levée at Dublin\r\nCastle; a Drawing-room held by the Princess of Wales; a state ball given\r\nby the Lord Lieutenant, which was a great success; a visit to the Arlane\r\nIndustrial School; an enthusiastic reception at Trinity College from a\r\ngreat and representative gathering; the presentation of new colours to\r\nthe Cornwall Regiment, then stationed in Dublin, with a speech--as on\r\nmost of the other occasions mentioned--from the Prince. On April 13th\r\nthe Prince and Princess started for Cork and on the way thither, at\r\nMallow, there was some attempt at a hostile demonstration. An effort of\r\nthe same kind was made at Cork but was nullified by the cordial\r\nhospitality of the masses of the people. The Royal visitors left Ireland\r\non April 17th well satisfied with the general loyalty and courtesy of\r\ntheir reception.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS PART IN THE QUEEN'S JUBILEE\r\n\r\nIn two of the great events which characterized the closing years of the\r\nVictorian era and his Mother's reign the Prince of Wales took a\r\nprominent and most important part--the Queen's Jubilee of 1887 and the\r\nDiamond Jubilee of ten years later. Upon no other occasion has his\r\nactual executive ability been better tested than in the latter event.\r\nFew, perhaps, can adequately realize the immense amount of work which\r\ndevolved upon, or was assumed by, the Prince in this connection. He\r\nundertook many of the functions; he was present with the Queen at all\r\nthe events of a busy, crowded week; he directed most of the detail and\r\nguided the complicated etiquette and procedure of the occasion; he\r\npersonally controlled the arrangements for the splendid procession\r\nthrough the streets of London; he overlooked the plans for the service\r\nin the Abbey and for the protection of the massed multitude in the\r\nstreets; he received and entertained many of the Royal personages who\r\ncame from abroad. In both of these great events the Prince of Wales\r\nappreciated the new and peculiar significance added to the formal or\r\npopular British celebrations by the presence of Colonial leaders and\r\ntroops and visitors. He had, in fact, to stamp the Imperial character\r\nand standing of these great demonstrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nThe Prince and His Family\r\n\r\n\r\nThe home life of the Prince and Princess of Wales was never an\r\nabsolutely private one. It was lived in the light of an almost ceaseless\r\npublicity. Not that the actual house of the Royal couple was, or could\r\never be, unduly invaded; but that every visitor was a more or less\r\ninterested spectator and student of conditions and that every trifling\r\nincident, as well as the more important matters, of every-day life were\r\nremembered, repeated, or recorded as they would never be in an ordinary\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME LIFE OF THE ROYAL COUPLE\r\n\r\nMemoirs of British statesmen, leaders in art, or literature, or\r\nreligion, or the Army and the Navy, teem with references, during forty\r\nyears, to the life of the Heir Apparent and his wife at Sandringham or\r\nMarlborough and, without exception, they convey the impression of honest\r\ndomestic happiness and unity. Gossip during that long period there had\r\nbeen, of course; unpleasant inuendoes had been uttered in a small and\r\nunpleasant section of the press; peculiar and, for the most obvious\r\nreasons, impossible stories had been cabled from time to time across the\r\nAtlantic; but they were patiently borne by those who were the easy\r\nvictims of silly statements and they were more than controverted by the\r\ntributes published from men who have lived on terms of intimacy with the\r\nRoyal family and whose death lifted, occasionally, the seal of secrecy\r\nfrom their natural reserve and made the expression of their opinions and\r\nexperiences possible.\r\n\r\nThe steady growth of the Prince and Princess in popular favour and the\r\nfact that even the most irresponsible or unscrupulous purveyor of news\r\nto such sheets as Mr. Labouchere's _Truth_ had never dared to reflect\r\nupon the Princess of Wales' beauty of character and life sufficed long\r\nbefore the accession of His Royal Highness to the Throne to kill even\r\nthe surreptitious stories which always float upon the surface of society\r\nregarding persons in Royal positions. In this connection may be quoted\r\nthe interesting reference to the subject made by Mr. G. W. Smalley, the\r\nwell-known American writer who for so many years acted as London\r\ncorrespondent of the New York _Tribune_. He was dealing, under date of\r\nJanuary 17th, 1892, with the premature death of the young Duke of\r\nClarence and, after referring to the freshness of affection which\r\nprevailed throughout the Royal family, he proceeded in these words: \"It\r\nis known to be strong and pure in all three generations--indeed there\r\nare now four--which together make up the Royal family of England. * * *\r\nThe domestic traditions were followed just as faithfully at Marlborough\r\nHouse as at Windsor. The Prince of Wales's has been not merely a good\r\nbut a devoted family. The Princess, whose whole life has been beautiful\r\nis in nothing more beautiful than in her love for her children. She\r\npassed from the bedside of her second son whose life she helped to\r\nsave--they say that Prince George never rallied till his mother returned\r\nto nurse him--to the bedside of her first-born by whose grave she has\r\nnow to stand.\"\r\n\r\nSandringham Hall in Norfolk was the real home of the Royal couple and it\r\nwas there that the children of their marriage spent much of their\r\nyounger days and received much of the training which was to fit them for\r\nlives of more or less public duty and the responsibilities which go with\r\npublic position. Marlborough House, in London, was the social centre,\r\nthe official environment, the public residence, of the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales. But the former place was always the one where they\r\nliked to be, where the heart of the Princess always rested with most\r\ninterest and affection, where the enjoyment of the comforts of country\r\nand home life came with most force to the Prince and to his children.\r\nAround Sandringham the grounds and woods and park were not allowed to be\r\nspoiled by art--the latter was used in just such a degree as would help\r\nnature. The house, or palace, was concealed from view until the visitor\r\nwas quite close to it and its home-like simplicity has always been a\r\nmuch-described quality. There was no elaboration of decoration, or\r\nstraining after an appearance of stately luxury. Comfort seemed to be\r\nthe aim and it was most certainly attained. The hall was designed\r\nsomewhat after the style of the old-fashioned banquetting halls, the\r\nvarious rooms were arranged for convenience and comfort, the decorations\r\nwere beautiful without being gorgeous, the objects of interest, ornament\r\nand curiosity in the drawing-rooms and elsewhere were, of course, simply\r\ncountless.\r\n\r\nAbove the porch in front of the Hall was the quaint legend: \"This house\r\nwas built by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and Alexandra his wife, in\r\nthe year of our Lord 1870\". The place was originally purchased for\r\n£220,000--saved from the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall by the Prince\r\nConsort's management--but further large sums had to be spent in order to\r\nmake the mansion comfortable and the estate the model which it\r\nafterwards became. The former was practically rebuilt in 1870 but not\r\nuntil every cottage or farm-house on the property had been first\r\nrebuilt, or repaired. The house contained, particularly, the great hall\r\nor saloon decorated with trophies of the chase in all countries and with\r\nmany caskets of gold and silver containing some of the addresses\r\npresented to the Prince from time to time; the dining-room with its high\r\noak roof and great fire-place, walls covered with tapestry given the\r\nPrince by the late King of Spain and a side-board covered with racing\r\nand yachting prizes in gold and silver; the chief drawing room with\r\nhangings of dull gold silk, furniture brocaded in soft red and gold,\r\nlarge panel mirrors and quantities of exquisite Sévres and Dresden\r\nchina; the conservatory where tea was often served; a great ball-room\r\nand handsome billiard and smoking rooms. The boudoir of the Princess has\r\nbeen described as a dream of grace and simple beauty and everything\r\nabout the place was arranged with a view to combining comfort with charm\r\nof appearance. The hundred servants employed in or out of the house had\r\neverything that could make their lives pleasant and happy.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION OF THE ROYAL FAMILY\r\n\r\nAmidst these surroundings the sons and daughters of the Royal couple\r\nwere brought up. Upon the education of the boys the Prince of Wales\r\nutilized his own knowledge of life as well as the traditions of his\r\nfather's training of himself. He is said to have believed that the study\r\nof men and the ways of the world had not been sufficiently considered in\r\nhis own case and that he wished his sons, while escaping the\r\nnervousness, constraints and adulation which surrounded the Court,\r\nshould also avoid the sycophancy and flattery which might be expected in\r\ntheir cases at a public school--even of the highest. He therefore\r\ndecided that a training ship in early youth and the fresh air, vigorous\r\nlife and wholesome discipline of the Navy in immediately following years\r\nwould be the best system of education. Prince Albert Victor and Prince\r\nGeorge were, consequently, placed on board the _Britannia_ training ship\r\nin 1870 and there they spent two years under conditions of study, work,\r\ntraining, mess, discipline and dress exactly similar to those of their\r\nshipmates. Their only dissipation was an occasional visit from their\r\nparents and the usual holiday period at home. During the two years spent\r\non this ship they learned carpentering, the details of a ship's rigging\r\nand a certain amount of engineering.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this period it was decided by the Prince to send his sons\r\nfor a prolonged cruise around the world as midshipmen on H.M.S.\r\n_Bacchante_. They were to have the same duties and treatment as the\r\nother midshipmen--except perhaps that their teaching would be more\r\ncareful and their studies more severe. Special instructors in\r\nseamanship, gunnery, mathematics and naval conditions were appointed,\r\nwith the Rev. J. N. Dalton, M.A., as Governor, in charge while they were\r\non shore and with supervision over their ordinary studies when at sea.\r\nLord Charles Scott, Captain of the war-ship, was, of course, supreme\r\nwhen the Princes were on board his vessel. The cruise of the _Bacchante_\r\ncommenced in September, 1879, and terminated in August, 1882. During\r\nthat period it traversed over fifty-four thousand miles and the Royal\r\nmidshipmen saw and visited Gibraltar, Madeira, Teneriffe, the West India\r\nIslands, Bermuda, the Cape Verde Islands, Monte Video, the Falkland\r\nIslands, Cape Colony, Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and\r\nBrisbane, Victoria and Melbourne, New South Wales and Sydney, the Fiji\r\nIslands, Japan, Hong-Kong, Shanghai, Canton, the Straits Settlements,\r\nCeylon, Egypt and the Holy Land, Athens, Crete, Corfu and Sicily. In\r\n1886 two handsome volumes, carefully edited by the Rev. Mr. Dalton, and\r\ncomprising the private journals and diaries of the young Princes, were\r\npublished in London and were found to contain many sensible reflections\r\nand much garnered information upon the many countries visited during\r\nthis circumnavigation of the globe. It was not all serious study and\r\nwork, however, during this period, and in almost every place touched at,\r\nwhere the Princes had anything like a chance, there is still to be found\r\nsome cherished anecdote of Royal jokes or pranks--especially on the part\r\nof Prince George.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile great care and thought had been devoted to the education of\r\nthe three daughters. From the nursery they passed into a school-room in\r\nwhich French and German, music, history and mathematics were the studies\r\nmost interesting to their father, while the learning of dressmaking and\r\nsewing in various branches, cooking, dairy work, the superintending of a\r\ngarden and the management of a house were carefully watched over by the\r\nPrincess of Wales. The Princess Victoria was said, in the days following\r\nthe completion of her education, to have the most domestic turn of mind\r\nof the three sisters, together with a pronounced artistic taste.\r\nLatterly she had taken over much of the supervision of household matters\r\nat Sandringham and Marlborough from her Royal mother and is, in 1902,\r\nthe only unmarried member of the family. The Princess Maud was, as a\r\ngirl, merry, pretty and clever; a capital all-round sportswoman and fond\r\nof horses, dogs, birds, yachting and riding; possessed at home of the\r\nnick-name \"Harry,\" and said to be the Prince's favourite daughter; fond\r\nof _incognito_ experiences, charities and amusements. The Princess\r\nLouise was a quieter and less striking character, and, like her younger\r\nsister, was afterwards allowed to marry the man of her choice, although\r\nhe did not possess the high position which the Royal father might\r\nnaturally have desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORIES OF PRINCE ALBERT VICTOR\r\n\r\nFollowing the return of the two Princes from their cruise, Prince Albert\r\nVictor was taken by his father to Cambridge, in 1883, and duly installed\r\nas an undergraduate of Trinity College. There he read regularly for six\r\nor seven hours a day, made himself thoroughly familiar with French and\r\nGerman, and associated himself in a most marked way with the men of\r\nintellect and character who were around him--nearly all his companions\r\nafterwards becoming distinguished in one way or another. Always modest\r\nand retiring he liked to entertain very quietly and to enjoy any\r\npossible musical occasion which presented itself. Hockey, polo and a\r\nlittle riding were his outdoor amusements. He came of age in 1885, the\r\nUniversity conferred upon him the honorary degree of LL.D., and, during\r\nthe next few years, he worked as an officer in the Army. It was on the\r\nattainment of his majority that Prince Albert Victor received a most\r\ninteresting letter, under date of January 7th, from Mr. Gladstone. In it\r\nthe veteran statesman said to the prospective Sovereign: \"There lies\r\nbefore Your Royal Highness in prospect the occupation--I trust at a\r\ndistant date--of a throne which, to me at least, appears the most\r\nillustrious in the world, from its history and associations, from its\r\nlegal basis, from the weight of the cares it brings, from the loyal love\r\nof the people, and from the unparalleled opportunities it gives, in so\r\nmany ways and so many regions, of doing good to the almost countless\r\nnumbers whom the Almighty has placed beneath the sceptre of England.\" He\r\nwent on to express the earnest hope that His Royal Highness might ever\r\ngrow in the principles and qualities which should adorn his great\r\nvocation.\r\n\r\nDuring the Session of Parliament in 1889, the Prince of Wales was voted\r\n£36,000 annually in trust for the use of his children, and at about the\r\nsame time it was decided to send Prince Albert Victor on a visit to\r\nIndia. On the way thither, at Athens, on October 20th, the latter was\r\npresent at the wedding of his two cousins, the Duke of Sparta and the\r\nPrincess Sophia of Prussia, daughter of the Empress Frederick. In the\r\ngreat Eastern Empire he remained until April, 1890; visiting Hyderabad,\r\nMysore, Madras and Calcutta, and meeting with a cordial reception which,\r\nhowever, lacked the great state and ceremony of his Royal father's\r\nfamous tour. Lord Lansdowne was Viceroy and made a most admirable host\r\nand mentor. On May 24th, following, the young Prince was created Duke of\r\nClarence and Avondale and Earl of Athlone, and commenced to take his\r\nplace in public life as Heir Presumptive to the Throne. In November of\r\nthe year 1891 Prince George who had, meanwhile, been pursuing his\r\nvocation in the Navy, was taken ill at Sandringham. The Princess was\r\naway but, pending her return, his father nursed him personally with care\r\nand devotion. Typhoid--the disease which had carried off the Prince\r\nConsort and so nearly killed the Heir Apparent, developed and the family\r\nanxiety was very great. At this point, on December 8th, the engagement\r\nof the Duke of Clarence to his cousin, the very popular and beautiful\r\nPrincess May of Teck, was announced amidst general congratulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF THE DUKE OF CLARENCE\r\n\r\nThen came one of the saddest events in the history of the British Royal\r\nfamily. The young Duke had only been engaged a few weeks and\r\npreparations had been commenced for the stately ceremonial of his\r\nmarriage, when it was announced that he had caught cold at the funeral\r\nof Prince Victor of Hohenlohe and was confined to his room. With but\r\nlittle notice pneumonia developed, the constitutional weakness of his\r\nsystem was unable to throw it off, and within a few days he was\r\ndead--January 15th, 1892. Prince George, in the meantime, had recovered,\r\nbut those who saw the Prince of Wales walking beside his eldest son's\r\nbody from Sandringham Church to the station, say that his obvious grief\r\nwas almost pathetic. As to the mother she never really got over the\r\nsadness of that death and the removal of her favourite son. If there\r\nwas, at times, a sad expression in her eyes, years after the event, it\r\nwas no doubt due to the sudden shock and great loss which then came to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nFive days afterwards, the following telegram to Sir Francis Knollys was\r\nmade public: \"The Prince and Princess of Wales are anxious to express to\r\nHer Majesty's subjects in the United Kingdom, the Colonies, and in\r\nIndia, the sense of their deep gratitude for the universal feeling of\r\nsympathy manifested toward them at a time when they are overpowered by\r\nthe terrible calamity which they have sustained in the loss of their\r\nbeloved eldest son. If sympathy at such a moment is of any avail, the\r\nremembrance that their grief has been shared by all classes will be a\r\nlasting consolation to their sorrowing hearts, and, if possible, will\r\nmake them more than ever attached to their dear country.\" The affection\r\nof Queen Victoria for this grandson, whom the _Times_ of January 19th\r\ndescribed as possessing \"modesty, affectionateness, kindness, love of\r\norder, the desire to render every man his due, and reverence for age and\r\ngreatness,\" is well-known to have been intense, and from Osborne, on\r\nJanuary 26th, Her Majesty issued the following letter:\r\n\r\n     \"I must once again give expression to my deep sense of the loyalty\r\n     and affectionate sympathy evinced by my subjects in every part of\r\n     my Empire on an occasion more sad and tragical than any but one\r\n     which has befallen me and mine, as well as the Nation. The\r\n     overwhelming misfortune of my dearly-loved grandson having been\r\n     thus suddenly cut off in the flower of his age, full of promise for\r\n     the future, amiable and gentle, and endearing himself to all,\r\n     renders it hard for his sorely-stricken parents, his dear young\r\n     bride and his fond Grandmother to bow in submission to the\r\n     inscrutable decrees of Providence.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, on June 27th, 1889, the marriage of the Princess Louise had\r\ntaken place. Her engagement to the Earl of Fife was somewhat of a\r\nsurprise to a social world which does not like to be surprised. Though\r\nthe Princess was twenty-two and the groom forty they had known each\r\nother for years and Lord Fife had been a frequent and welcome guest at\r\nSandringham, while the Prince and Princess of Wales had long been on\r\nterms of intimacy with his parents. His was the only bachelor's house at\r\nwhich the Princess of Wales had ever been entertained. It could not, of\r\ncourse, be supposed that this first marriage in his family--the children\r\nof which might be very close to the Throne--was quite as lofty a match\r\nas the Royal father might wish, yet when he found that the matter was\r\nsettled so far as the couple were personally concerned, he accepted the\r\nsituation and asked the Queen's consent to the engagement. The wedding\r\nwas duly celebrated at Buckingham Palace in the presence of the Queen,\r\nthe Prince and Princess of Wales and their children, the King of the\r\nHelenes, the Crown Prince of Denmark, and the Grand Duke of Hesse. Lord\r\nFife, who was personally very wealthy, was created Duke of Fife and\r\nMarquess of Macduff, and his wife shared in the subsequent special grant\r\ngiven to the Heir Apparent for the proper maintenance of his children.\r\nAfterwards, on the birth of the first child of the Duke and Duchess it\r\nwas decided that she should not assume Royal rank but be known by the\r\ncourtesy title due to her father's place in the Peerage. This\r\nchild--Lady Alexandra Victoria Alberta Edwina Louise Duff--was born on\r\nMay 17th, 1891, and on April 3rd, 1893, the Lady Maud Alexandra Victoria\r\nGeorgia Bertha Duff was born. Meanwhile an interesting event had\r\noccurred on March 10, 1888, in the celebration of the Silver Wedding of\r\nthe Prince and Princess of Wales. Illuminations in London and a ball at\r\nBuckingham Palace marked the event.\r\n\r\nPrince George of Wales was now Heir Presumptive to the Throne and upon\r\nhim were devolved the more or less arduous duties of that position.\r\nFollowing his brother's death he gave up active service in the Navy and\r\non May 24th, 1892, was created Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron\r\nKillarney. The importance of his marriage was now obvious and a year and\r\na quarter after the death of the Duke of Clarence the engagement of his\r\nbrother to the Princess May of Teck was officially announced. The\r\nwedding took place on July 6th, 1893, and there could be no doubt by\r\nthat time of the popularity of the young couple and of the national\r\npleasure at their union. The decorations in London eclipsed those of the\r\nQueen's ubilee and the crowds were equally great. The ceremony was\r\nperformed at the Chapel Royal, St. James's, instead of at St. George's,\r\nWindsor, where the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Princesses Helena and\r\nLouise and the Dukes of Albany and Connaught had been wedded. Amongst\r\nthe great gathering present at the ceremony were Her Majesty and the\r\nRoyal family as a whole, the Duke and Duchess of Teck, Lord Salisbury,\r\nLord Rosebery, Mr. Morley, Mr. Bryce, Mr. Chamberlain, Sir W. V.\r\nHarcourt, Lord Ripon, Lord Spencer, Lord Herschell, Mr. Balfour, Mr.\r\nGoschen, the Dukes of Argyll, Norfolk and Devonshire, Mr. Gladstone, the\r\nHon. T. F. Bayard, American Minister, several Indian Princes and many\r\nothers. The _Times_ of July 7th had the following comment upon the\r\nevent:\r\n\r\n     \"Few Royal weddings of our time aroused such unusual enthusiasm as\r\n     the union of the Duke of York with the bride of his choice--an\r\n     English Princess, born and bred in an English home, endeared to all\r\n     hearts by the now softened memory of a tragic sorrow and richly\r\n     endowed with all the qualities which inspire the brightest hopes\r\n     for the future. Fewer still have ever been celebrated with happier\r\n     omens, or in more auspicious circumstances than that of yesterday.\r\n     The pomp of a brilliant Court, the acclaim, at once tumultuous and\r\n     orderly, of the mightiest of cities, spontaneously making holiday\r\n     and decking itself in its brightest and bravest, the simultaneous\r\n     rejoicing of a whole people, the sympathy, unbought and yet\r\n     priceless, of a world-wide Empire, the radiant splendour of an\r\n     English summer day--all these combined to make the ceremony of\r\n     yesterday an occasion as memorable as that of the Jubilee itself.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING EDWARD AND HIS FAMOUS RACE HORSE MINORU, WHICH WON\r\nTHE DERBY IN 1909.\r\n\r\nMinoru (Herbert Jones up), Mr. Richard Marsh (Trainer to\r\nthe late King), Lord Marcus Beresford (Manager of the late King's\r\nthoroughbreds), King Edward.\r\n\r\nKing Edward was not only a great King, but a great sportsman as well. He\r\nhad a typically British love of outdoor pastimes as an active\r\nparticipator and not a mere looker-on. At various times he was\r\nassociated with nearly every form of British sport. Yachting and\r\nshooting were two of his favorites, but it was his close connection with\r\nthe turf which most appealed to the general public. Probably no other\r\nbreeder of thoroughbreds ever had such a trio of equine giants as\r\nFlorizel II, Persimmon and Diamond Jubilee. And in one year, 1909, he\r\nwon over £29,000. When his horse Minoru won the Derby in 1909, the\r\npeople in their enthusiasm surged all over the course after the race,\r\nbut the King went down amongst them, and himself led his horse in to the\r\npaddock.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAMILIAR SNAPSHOTS OF KING EDWARD AS HIS SUBJECTS BEST\r\nKNEW HIM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING EDWARD'S MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS.\r\n\r\n1.

The Duke of\r\nYork wore a simple Captain's uniform and was supported by his Royal\r\nfather and the Duke of Edinburgh. The bride was described in the papers\r\nof the time as wearing silver and white brocade, with clustered\r\nshamrocks, roses and thistles. On July 10th the Queen addressed one of\r\nher usual tactful and gracious letters to the nation expressive of her\r\npersonal sympathy with the people and of theirs with her and her family.\r\n\r\nThe eldest child of this marriage--Prince Edward Albert Christian George\r\nAndrew Patrick David--was direct in succession to the Throne after his\r\nfather and was born on June 23, 1894. The second child was Prince Albert\r\nFrederick Arthur George, born on December 14, 1895. Princess Victoria\r\nAlexandra Alice Mary, was born on April 25th, 1897, and Prince Henry\r\nWilliam Frederick Albert on March 31, 1900. The Prince of Wales was\r\ngreatly attached to his grandchildren and nothing in these later years\r\ngave him greater pleasure than having around him the youthful scions of\r\nthe House of Fife, or that of York, and giving them presents and other\r\nmeans of enjoyment. On July 22, 1896, his third daughter, the Princess\r\nMaud, was married to Prince Charles, second son of the Crown Prince of\r\nDenmark. The ceremony was performed in the private Chapel of Buckingham\r\nPalace, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, in the presence of the Queen\r\nand most of the members of the Royal family. The Duke and Duchess of\r\nSparta, the Crown Prince and Princess of Denmark, Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone\r\nand Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlain were amongst the guests. The bridesmaids\r\nwere Princesses Ingeborg of Denmark, Victoria of Wales, Victoria of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, Thyra of Denmark, Victoria Patricia of Connaught,\r\nMargaret of Connaught, Alice of Albany and the Lady Alexandra Duff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nThe Prince as a Social Leader\r\n\r\n\r\nThe influence wielded upon Society by the Prince of Wales, during nearly\r\nforty years of public life, was so marked and important as to merit\r\nextended consideration. Society, of course, in such a connection\r\nincludes much more than any particular set of persons however select, or\r\ndistinguished, or aristocratic; it means, in fact, all the varied social\r\ncircles, high and low, which have recognized principles of etiquette and\r\nintercourse and common customs of amusement and fashion. Taken in this\r\nwide sense of the word, no personage in the history of Europe during the\r\nnineteenth century wielded so great an influence as His Royal Highness.\r\nHe helped to make the unbounded after-dinner drinking of a previous\r\nperiod unpopular and socially un-orthodox; he encouraged in his more\r\nyouthful days and always enjoyed the pleasures of dancing; he introduced\r\nvery largely the popular fashion of a cigarette after dinner in place of\r\nendless heavy cigars and their accompaniment of liquors; he did much to\r\nencourage and popularize a love for music; he led the fashion in the\r\nmatter of men's dress and, upon the whole, society in most civilized\r\ncountries has to thank him for simple and dignified customs in this\r\nrespect; he supported the race-course with courage and persistence and\r\nnot only made racing more popular but helped to establish its code and\r\noperation upon a high plane of honour--by far the highest and cleanest\r\nin the world; he made charity and the support of its varied public\r\ninstitutions popular and fashionable; he showed the gilded youth of a\r\ngreat social world that work was a good thing for a Prince and a peer\r\nas well as for a peasant; he, with his beautiful wife, presented for\r\nmany years a model home and family life to the nation and they,\r\ntogether, discouraged many of the petty vices and small faults which\r\ncreep into all social systems from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE AT MARLBOROUGH HOUSE\r\n\r\nThe official and social centre of this leadership in the British world\r\nwas at Marlborough House--a large and unpretentious residence in the\r\nheart of London. That the place was exquisitely furnished and equipped\r\ngoes without saying; that it was comfortable in the extreme is equally a\r\nmatter of course to those acquainted with the taste and house-keeping\r\ncapacities of the Princess of Wales. It was filled with fine engravings\r\nand paintings illustrative of the Victorian era; it teemed with\r\nmementoes and memorials of past incidents, travels and friendships in\r\nthe lives of the Royal couple; it contained rooms suited for every\r\npurpose required in the exacting life and multifarious public duties of\r\nits occupants. The Prince's study, where only intimates were admitted,\r\nhas been described as the room of a hard-working man of business. When\r\nat Marlborough House, His Royal Highness used to mark out his time, each\r\nday, with care and precision and even then it was difficult to fill his\r\nmany and varied engagements. There were certain public functions such as\r\nthe Horse Show at Islington, or the Royal Military Tournament, to which\r\nthe Prince and Princess always went when in London. There were a certain\r\nnumber of state dinners given in place of those which, under other\r\ncircumstances, would have been given by the Sovereign. Diplomatic\r\ndinners were also incidents of the season at Marlborough House as well\r\nas dinners which included the Government and Opposition leaders and\r\ngreat banquets held from time to time in honour of foreign guests of the\r\nnation or Royal relations visiting the country.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room at Marlborough was handsome but plain, the arrangements\r\nof the table setting an example of simplicity which society, in this\r\ncase, did not always follow. The Prince of Wales never concealed his\r\ndislike for the extremely lengthy banquets which were the custom in his\r\nyouth and succeeded, so far as private dinner-parties were concerned, in\r\nrevolutionizing the system. To the favoured guest Marlborough House was\r\na scene of historic as well as personal interest. It had been the home\r\nof the great Duke of that name; the residence of Prince Leopold,\r\nintended husband of the lamented Princess Charlotte, and afterwards King\r\nof the Belgians; the dower-house of Queen Adelaide; the choice of the\r\nPrince Consort for his son's London home. The general contents of the\r\nhouse were worthy of its history. In one room were splendid panels of\r\nGobelin tapestry presented by Napoleon; in another were the rare and\r\nwonderful treasures of Indian work, in gold, silver, jewelry and\r\nembroidery, brought home from the Royal visit to Hindostan; elsewhere\r\nwas a beautiful vase given the Prince by Alexander II. of Russia,\r\nenamelled work from the East, richly ornamented swords, trays of solid\r\ngold, tables full of presentation keys, medals, trowels and memorials of\r\nall kinds.\r\n\r\nSocially, the drawing-room was the central feature of interest. Its\r\ngeneral effect has been described[6] as being white and gold and pale\r\npink, its floor of polished oak with an Axminster carpet in the centre,\r\nand with an appearance of vastness modified by pillars of white and\r\ngold. There were innumerable mirrors and the furniture was upholstered\r\nin deep red, while rare china, flowers, photographs, statuettes, and\r\nsmall ornaments of gold and silver and enamel were scattered in\r\nprofusion upon tables, cabinets and mantels. Here the most eminent men\r\nand beautiful or clever women of Great Britain and the world have been\r\nentertained and here, or in the well-kept grounds, the intimate friends\r\nof the Prince and Princess have gathered from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe society received at Marlborough was always cosmopolitan in its\r\nvariety but it was never of the kind which slander sometimes insinuated.\r\nNo man has ever been more democratic, so far as mere class barriers are\r\nconcerned, than was the Prince of Wales, but no one knew better than he\r\nwhere to draw the line in his entertainments. The Princess, for her\r\npart, was at all times a model hostess, and each knew too well what was\r\ndue to the other to make the social life of the Palace anything more\r\nthan a correct embodiment and representation of the social life of\r\nLondon. The liberality of the Prince was made evident in later years in\r\nmaking cultivated and representative Americans or Jews welcome at his\r\nfunctions. His very proper and openly-avowed liking for beautiful women\r\nencouraged at one time a social class of \"professional beauties,\" but as\r\nsoon as this patronage was found to have been misused and vulgarized in\r\ncertain quarters, he and the Princess quietly dropped those who were\r\nmaking a trade of the Royal recognition. A story has been told\r\nillustrating the capacity which the Prince of Wales always showed for\r\nkeeping people in their proper places. On one occasion, at a great\r\ncharitable bazaar in Albert Hall, which he had honoured with his\r\npresence, he went up to a refreshment stall and asked for a cup of tea.\r\nThe fair vendor--there was no doubt of her beauty--before handing the\r\ncup to His Royal Highness took a drink from it, saying, \"_now_ the price\r\nwill be five guineas!\" The Prince gravely paid the money, handed back\r\nthe cup of tea and said, \"Will you please give me a clean cup?\"\r\n\r\nThe Royal etiquette, as to social entertainments and the acceptance of\r\ninvitations to country houses, or city functions, was always very exact\r\nand was carried out along lines fixed by the Prince and Princess in\r\ntheir early married life. Outside of the aristocracy, or a small list\r\nof personal friends, very few hospitable invitations were ever accepted\r\nand as such acceptance meant certain admission to the higher ranks of\r\nsociety the pressure upon personal friends or officials can easily be\r\nimagined. The Prince always objected to the lavish and extravagant style\r\nof such entertainments and this was one important reason for limiting\r\nhis circle of hosts and hostesses. At the country houses visited from\r\ntime to time, or at the private dinners to which he accepted\r\ninvitations, the Prince was supposed to usually see a list of the guests\r\nand to always have the right of adding names to it. The delicate and\r\nindirect task of attending to this matter was for many years confided to\r\nMr. Harry Tyrwhitt Wilson; who also had the arrangement of details in\r\nconnection with the visits largely in his hands. One incident of the\r\nvisits to country houses was an effort on the part of the Prince in\r\nrecent years to discourage and check the wholesale habit of tipping\r\nservants. He took the method of leaving a moderate and suitable sum for\r\nthe purpose and this was distributed after he had left the place. It may\r\nbe added that whenever the Prince went anywhere he was always\r\naccompanied by an equerry, his own valets, a footman to wait on him at\r\nmeals, and certain other servants.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND COMPANIONS OF THE PRINCE\r\n\r\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales, separately or together as the case may\r\nbe, have visited most of the splendid homes of England. Chief amongst\r\nthose whom they delighted to visit were the Duke and Duchess of\r\nDevonshire and Chatsworth; Hardwick Hall and Compton Place have,\r\ntherefore, more than once seen most brilliant entertainments in their\r\nhonour. Lord and Lady Cadogan were frequent and favourite hosts. Lord\r\nand Lady Londonderry, the Earl and Countess of Warwick, the Duke of\r\nRichmond at Goodwood House, the late Duke of Westminster at Eaton Hall,\r\nall entertained the Royal couple upon more than one occasion. Lord\r\nAlington, the late Duke of Beaufort, and Sir Edward Lawson gave the\r\nPrince frequent and enjoyable shooting. The Duchess of Marlborough and\r\nMrs. Arthur Paget were two American ladies whom His Royal Highness\r\ncounted as friends and hostesses. Several members of the Rothschild\r\nfamily entertained the Heir Apparent at homes which have been described\r\nas models of comfort and museums of art, while Lord Penrhyn was a Welsh\r\nmagnate whom he once visited with great pleasure, and the late Baron\r\nHirsch, in his Hungarian shootings, gave him splendid sport upon more\r\nthan one occasion.\r\n\r\nNo phrase has been more conspicuous in recent years and none have been\r\nmore abused in meaning and application than that of \"the Prince's set.\"\r\nProperly used, it meant his personal friends or those who, along\r\nspecific and often very diverse lines of sport, society, work, or\r\ntravel, were necessarily intimate with His Royal Highness. Improperly\r\napplied, it was supposed to designate a rather fast and very \"smart\" set\r\nof wealthy social magnates. In this latter guise it had really no\r\nexistence. Those who were familiar with the Prince of Wales' career and\r\ncharacter knew that mere wealth was the last thing which ever attracted\r\nhim, and the one thing which was a most certainly uncertain basis upon\r\nwhich to gain his patronage; to say nothing of his friendship. Many\r\ndisappointed millionaires can speak with accuracy upon this point--if\r\nthey wished to. On the other hand, honest love of racing, or shooting,\r\nor yachting; brilliancy of conversation in man or woman and conspicuous\r\nbeauty or charm of manner in the latter; knowledge of the world and\r\ncapacity to do the right thing in the right way at the right time were\r\nconspicuous factors in obtaining the friendship of the Prince of Wales.\r\nAchievements in art, or distinction in the Army and Navy, or great\r\nphilanthropic interests and undertakings, were always elements of\r\nrecognized importance.\r\n\r\nDeer-stalking in the Highlands made friends and hosts such as the late\r\nDukes of Sutherland and Hamilton, Mr. Farquharson of Invercauld and Lord\r\nGlenesk. During his annual visits to Homburg, for many years, and in the\r\nrest and liberty which he allowed himself there, the Prince's favourite\r\ncompanion, as he was his most devoted friend, was the late Mr.\r\nChristopher Sykes. Lord Brampton--the clever, witty and eccentric Judge\r\nwho was better known as Sir Henry Hawkins--the Right Hon. \"Jimmy\"\r\nLowther, M.P., Lord Charles and Lord William Beresford, and Sir Allen\r\nYoung were also special friends of the holiday season. Admiral Sir Henry\r\nKeppel was a very old friend of the Prince and his family and this\r\nintimacy also included Mr. and Mrs. George Keppel. Lord Rosebery, Lord\r\nBeaconsfield, Lord Randolph Churchill and the late Lord Derby could all\r\nclaim the Royal friendship, while Lord and Lady Farquhar were delightful\r\nand favourite hosts of both the Prince and his wife. Colonel Oliver\r\nMontagu was a very old and dear friend, and the Earl of Aylesford, Lord\r\nCadogan, General Lord Wantage, Colonel Owen Williams, Earl Carrington,\r\nLord and Lady Dudley and Lord Russell of Killowen ranked in the category\r\nof friendship. Lord and Lady Alington had the rare distinction of giving\r\ndances to which the Princess of Wales used to take her daughters when\r\nthey were young girls.\r\n\r\nAmongst hostesses other than those already mentioned whose\r\nentertainments the Prince liked to attend were Mrs. Bischoffstein and\r\nMrs. Arthur Rothschild. Other personal friends were the late Earl of\r\nLathom, the bright and witty Marchioness of Aylesbury, Lord James of\r\nHereford and the late Sir Charles Hall. Amongst artists whom the Prince\r\ngreatly favoured were Sir Charles and Lady Hallé and the late Lord\r\nLeighton. No closer and more devoted friends of the Prince could be\r\nfound than the members of his own Household, and the public was long\r\naware of this in the persons of Lord Suffield, Sir Francis Knollys and\r\nSir Dighton Probyn, in particular. The Prince delighted in doing honour\r\nto those whom he accepted as friends. He marked his sorrow at the deaths\r\nof Colonel Oliver Montagu and Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild by\r\npersonally attending their funerals--an exception to the rule which he\r\nhad set himself in this connection.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness frequently gave his powerful patronage to the\r\npromotion of Memorials to those who had been honoured by his friendship\r\nand who deserved honour upon national grounds. An early instance of this\r\nwas the case of Dean Stanley. A later one, on July 13, 1900, was the\r\ngathering called at Marlborough House and presided over by the Prince\r\nfor the purpose of erecting a national memorial in Westminster Abbey to\r\nthe Duke of Westminster. In speaking, His Royal Highness said: \"To me\r\npersonally the death of the Duke meant the loss of a life-long friend. I\r\nhad known him from his boyhood and there is no one whose friendship I\r\nappreciated more than his. In my judgment there is no one whose public\r\nservices more fully deserve public recognition by his countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nFidelity to friends and appreciation of manly qualities and special\r\nabilities were always characteristic of the Prince of Wales and,\r\ncombined with his tact and the unusual qualifications of the Princess as\r\na hostess, made Marlborough and Sandringham, in different ways, the most\r\nideal centres of social entertainment. Taken as a whole, the Prince's\r\nleadership of society was emphatically for good. His approval and\r\npatronage of the opera or the theatre, the race-course or the\r\nshooting-box, may not have been agreeable to some people, but they\r\nrepresented the popular opinion of the great majority. He took things as\r\nthey were, enjoyed them in a full-hearted and honest way, improved the\r\n_morale_ of the social system and the practices in vogue in many\r\ndirections and left Society infinitely better and more honest than he\r\nhad found it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] _Private Life of King Edward VII._ By a member of the Royal\r\nHousehold. D. Appleton & Co. N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nThe Prince as a Sportsman\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his devotion to the \"sport of kings\" the Prince of Wales followed the\r\nexcellent example of Henry VIII, Queen Elizabeth, Charles I, Charles II,\r\nWilliam of Orange, Queen Anne, the Duke of Cumberland, George IV, and\r\nWilliam IV. He represented in this respect an inherent and seemingly\r\nnatural liking of the English people. With them the manly art of war,\r\nthe physical excitements of chivalry, and tests of endurance in civil\r\nand foreign struggles, have been replaced by the games and sports of a\r\nquieter and more peaceful period. Riding to hounds, steeple-chasing and\r\nthe amateur or professional race-course represent a most popular as well\r\nas aristocratic phase of this development. The Prince of Wales, early in\r\nhis life, took a liking to racing in all its forms and encouraged\r\nsteeple-chasing at a time when it was neither fashionable nor popular.\r\nHe became a member of the Jockey Club in 1868. It was not, however,\r\nuntil 1877 that his afterwards famous colours of purple, gold band,\r\nscarlet sleeves and black velvet cap with gold fringe, were carried at\r\nNewmarket in the presence of the Princess and before a great and\r\nfashionable gathering. Five years later His Royal Highness won the\r\nHousehold Brigade Cup at Sandown and thenceforward his interest in the\r\nsport was keen, although it was not till some years afterwards that he\r\nestablished his own racing-stable which, in 1890, was placed under the\r\nefficient management of Lord Marcus Beresford.\r\n\r\nDuring these years the Prince lost a good deal of money, though the\r\namount was never known or even truthfully guessed at, but in 1889 his\r\nhorses began also to win. In that year he won £204, in 1891 £4148, in\r\n1894 £3499, and in the next four years a total of £57,430. In 1892 a\r\nRoyal stud was founded at Sandringham and there _Persimmon_ and _Diamond\r\nJubilee_ were bred. The Derby of 1896 was perhaps, the most historic of\r\nEnglish racing events. Attended by a crowd of three hundred thousand\r\npeople, raced in with horses owned by such generous patrons of the turf\r\nas the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Westminister and Mr. Leopold de\r\nRothschild, watched with unusual interest by the crowd, it resulted in\r\nthe most popular victory in the history of English sport. The Prince had\r\nfought hard for this blue ribbon of the turf, he had faced defeat and\r\ndiscouragement again and again and it was known that he would prize\r\nsuccess more than anything within the limits of his ambition. When,\r\ntherefore, _Persimmon_ carried his colours to the first victory won at\r\nEpsom by a Prince of Wales in a hundred years, the delight of the Royal\r\nowner was evident. The great gathering of people cheered as if each\r\nperson present had himself won the race and their obvious enthusiasm was\r\nan expression of personal liking as well as loyalty. This was a great\r\nyear for the Prince whose horses not only won the Derby, the St. Leger\r\nand the £10,000 Jockey Club Stakes but also the Newmarket Stakes. In\r\n1897 _Persimmon_ won the Ascot Cup and the Eclipse Stakes (worth\r\ntogether £12,700) and was then retired from the turf. Trained by Richard\r\nMarsh and ridden by John Watts, this horse had given his Royal owner not\r\nonly financial success but--what he valued infinitely more--great\r\nvictories in a sport which he loved.\r\n\r\nFrom that time on the Prince continued to be lucky with his horses. At\r\nthe Derby of 1900 _Diamond Jubilee_ won in exactly the same time as the\r\nRoyal horse of 1896 had done. At this race, on May 30th, the Prince was\r\naccompanied by a large number of noblemen and ladies and gentlemen\r\ninterested in racing. The Duke of Devonshire, Lord Rothschild, Lord\r\nCheylesmore, the Marquess of Londonderry, the Duke of Portland, Lord\r\nFarquhar, the Earl of Chesterfield, the Earl and Countess of Crewe, the\r\nEarl and Countess Carrington, and others, came from London in the Royal\r\nspecial train. In the Royal box at the races were the King of Sweden,\r\nthe Duke and Duchess of Connaught, the Princess Victoria, the Duke of\r\nCambridge and other royalties. The success of the Prince's horse in two\r\nminutes, forty-two seconds, was received with tremendous applause and\r\nwith general congratulation in a large section of the press while, in\r\nthe same year, the Royal colours were also carried to victory at the\r\nGrand National and the Two Thousand Guineas. The whole record was a\r\nunique one; the time at the Derby was the fastest in the history of the\r\ncourse; the winner of 1900 was a brother to the winner in 1896; and\r\nthose who lost money appeared to be as glad that the popular Prince\r\nshould win as if they had themselves backed his horse.\r\n\r\n\r\nRACING FRIENDS AND YACHTING EXPERIENCES\r\n\r\nThe part taken by His Royal Highness in sporting matters naturally\r\nresulted in many friendships built around a mutual love of racing, of\r\nriding, and of the horse. Conspicuous amongst the good sportsmen who\r\nwere also good friends of the Prince were the names of the Duke of\r\nPortland, Sir George Wombwell, Sir Reuben Sassoon, the Rothschilds, the\r\nlate Lord Sefton, Mr. Henry Chaplin, the Earl of Zetland and Sir\r\nFrederick Johnstone. Sir John Astley, Lord and Lady Claude Hamilton, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Arthur James, Sir Edward Lawson, Sir Edward Hulse, Lord and\r\nLady Gerard, the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon, Sir William Russell and\r\nLady Dorothy Neville may be mentioned amongst other devotees of the turf\r\nwho ranked in later years as friends of the Prince of Wales in this\r\nparticular social \"set.\" In this connection the annual Derby Day dinner\r\nmust be mentioned. From 1887 to the time of the Prince's accession this\r\nRoyal banquet to the members of the Jockey Club was an important\r\ninstitution and a much looked-for event in racing circles. Latterly it\r\nwas the chief regular entertainment of the year at Marlborough House.\r\nThe function was elaborate yet not too formal. Evening dress and not\r\nuniform was the custom; the guests included about fifty of the leading\r\npatrons of the turf and there were generally half-a-dozen of the Royal\r\nfamily present; the great silver dinner service ordered by the Prince at\r\nhis marriage was always used; and the dining-room with its side-boards\r\nladen with gold and silver trophies of the race-course and attendants in\r\nscarlet, blue and gold, was a brilliant sight. Dinner did not usually\r\nlast more than an hour and then the guests adjourned to the drawing-room\r\nfor whist. In 1896 and 1900 the toast of the Derby winner, which had so\r\noften been proposed by the Royal host, had to be given to some one\r\nelse--greatly to the enthusiasm of the guests.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales was always a fearless rider and was fond of it from\r\nchildhood. As an undergraduate at Christ-Church he constantly hunted\r\nwith Lord Macclesfield's pack and was then considered a hard rider; but\r\nin after years his riding was mainly done in connection with military\r\nand other functions and for exercise, in a milder way than that of\r\nfollowing the hounds. Akin, in some respects to the sport of racing, is\r\nthat of yachting and to this the Prince of Wales was almost equally\r\ndevoted. Naturally fond of the sea, trained in ocean travel in days when\r\nit was no pleasant drawing-room experience to cross the Atlantic,\r\nfamiliar with every part of a yacht and detail of its management, it was\r\nonly fitting that the Heir to the throne of the seas should be an\r\naccomplished yachtsman. His first racing-yacht was the _Aline_ and his\r\nnext one, the _Britannia_, was for a time the most successful of large\r\nracing-yachts. Many splendid cups and pieces of plate graced the buffets\r\nof Sandringham and Marlborough and marked the victories of the Prince;\r\nthough any prize moneys won in this way were always handed over to his\r\nCaptain and crew as an addition to their already handsome pay.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness was a capital sailor. In returning from his Canadian\r\nand American tour in 1860 his ship was driven out of its course by a\r\nsevere storm and so much alarm was caused by the delay that a British\r\nfleet was sent out to search for it; but, different as were the\r\nconditions of travel in those days, the Prince was not found to be any\r\nthe worse for his stormy experience. In after years when cruising along\r\nthe coasts of Europe, or traversing the Pacific and Indian oceans, he\r\nmet with many a storm and severe strain, so far as weather was\r\nconcerned, without effect. It is said, however, that he was troubled\r\nsomewhat by rough weather in the English Channel. As Commodore of the\r\nRoyal Yacht Squadron his patronage did very much in making the sport\r\npopular and fashionable and in creating the Cowes Regatta as a great\r\nyachting function. To this Royal Yacht Club every consideration in the\r\nway of prizes was given and the Queen, the Prince, the Emperor William\r\nof Germany, and Napoleon III. of France, offered prizes or trophies,\r\nfrom time to time. As Commodore--which office he accepted in 1882--His\r\nRoyal Highness had as predecessors the Earl of Yarborough, the Marquess\r\nof Donegal and the Earl of Wilton. The Vice-Commodore for many years was\r\nthe Marquess of Ormonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAVY AND LOVE OF SHOOTING\r\n\r\nOn July 18th, 1887, the position of the Heir Apparent was recognized and\r\nthe Navy complimented through his appointment by the Queen as Honorary\r\nAdmiral of the Fleet. Some criticism was expressed in a portion of the\r\nRadical press mainly, it was stated, through ignorance of the Prince's\r\nreal qualifications as both a seaman and yachtsman. Upon his accession\r\nto the Throne no single action was more popular than King Edward's\r\nretention of this latter title and the interest which he continued to\r\nshow in the Navy. His Majesty took as great interest in Sir Thomas\r\nLipton's efforts to win the America Cup as he had in the previous\r\nattempts of Lord Dunraven. Sir Thomas was, apparently, a congenial\r\nspirit in this connection and from both Prince and King he received a\r\ngood deal of favour. It was while cruising with him on board _Shamrock\r\nII._, off Southampton, (May 22, 1901) that a heavy wind unexpectedly\r\nstrained the spars and gear too much and brought down the top-mast and\r\nmainmast in a sudden wreck which crashed over the side of the frail\r\nyacht. The danger to the King was very great and a difference of ten\r\nseconds in his position would probably have given fatal results. The\r\nvisit to the yacht was, of course, a private one, but such an incident\r\nas this made the affair very widely commented upon. The London _Daily\r\nExpress_ of the succeeding day embodied a good deal of public opinion in\r\nthe following remarks:\r\n\r\n     \"King though he be, he is resolute to live the frank and free life\r\n     of an English gentleman, taking the chances of sport by land and\r\n     sea as gaily as any undistinguished son of the people, whose life\r\n     is of no smallest national import. That is the sort of King we\r\n     want, the sort of King we will die for if need be--a King who holds\r\n     his own in every manly exercise, loving sport all the more because\r\n     it contains the element of danger that possesses such a subtle\r\n     attraction for men of Anglo-Saxon blood.\"\r\n\r\nShooting was probably the favourite all-round sport of the Prince of\r\nWales and in this he heartily embodied one more characteristic of the\r\ntypical English gentleman. It has been described as a positive passion\r\nwith him and as being \"the love of his life.\" His father had been a\r\nthorough sportsman, though not a very good shot; the son became not only\r\na thorough sportsman but perhaps the best shot in the United Kingdom. At\r\nseven years of age he was taught deer-stalking, at Oxford he frequently\r\ndid a day's shooting on neighbouring estates, and, in his American and\r\nCanadian tour, a great pleasure to the young man was an occasional day's\r\nsport. At Sandringham he early mapped out his estate into a series of\r\ndrives and soon combined with other famous shots to create and make\r\npopular the big _battues_ which were afterwards so well known and which\r\ncame to constitute so important an event in the shooting seasons at his\r\nNorfolk home. But His Royal Highness never confined himself to shooting\r\npheasants, hares, or rabbits. Deer-stalking and shooting grouse were\r\nfavourite pursuits, and he knew no greater pleasure than to spend a day,\r\nor days, upon the moors, accompanied by friends and hosts such as the\r\nlate Duke of Sutherland, his son-in-law, the Duke of Fife, Mr. Mackenzie\r\nof Kintail and Colonel Farquharson of Invercauld. Going out from\r\nAbergeldie, or Balmoral, or Mar Lodge on a stalking expedition, the\r\nPrince cared neither for exposure to bad weather, nor severe exertion,\r\nso long as he could return with a bag of several head of deer. With the\r\nGerman Emperor and the late Duke of Coburg he enjoyed splendid sport in\r\nthe vast forests of Central Europe from time to time, and with Baron\r\nHirsch, on his great Hungarian estates, he had hunted deer, chamois,\r\nwild boar and roebuck, as he had shot game in America, hunted tigers and\r\nelephants in India, shot crocodiles in Egypt and hunted in the forests\r\nof Ceylon or Denmark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER AND HIS UNCLE\r\n  Photograph by Paul Thompson, New York.\r\n\r\nThe Rt.

Only a few days after his return from this journey he was taken\r\nfatally ill.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nHabits and Character of the Prince\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring forty years of his career as Prince of Wales, King Edward VII.\r\nwas probably the most talked-of man in the United Kingdom. Good-natured\r\nstories, ill-natured anecdotes, criticisms grading down from the\r\nmalicious to the very mild, praise ranging from the fulsome to the\r\nfeeble point, falsehoods great and falsehoods small, have found currency\r\nnot confined to the English language and ranging through \"yarns\" of\r\ngutter journals in London, Paris, Berlin, New York or Calcutta, in\r\nvaried languages, and in many degrees of fabrication. Outside of the\r\nUnited Kingdom some of these stories have been more or less believed;\r\neven in his own national home there were always people ready and willing\r\nto accept the worst that they heard about a great public personage.\r\nWhere he was known best, however, the influence of these things upon the\r\nreputation of the Prince of Wales was least and, in fact, so small as to\r\nafford little or no excuse for dealing with them. Abroad, however, it\r\nhad always been different, and in the United States, thirty years before\r\nhis accession to the Throne, it was conspicuously so. With the passing\r\nyears, of course, and with growing knowledge of the Prince's position\r\nand character, the situation greatly changed.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the Prince of Wales, from the early days of his\r\nmanhood, was in his personal and private relations a jovial, honest and\r\nhonourable English gentleman; possessed of a full sense of his\r\nresponsibility in much burdensome work and ceremonial and with a\r\ngrowing appreciation, as years passed, of his place as a sort of\r\nimpartial Empire statesman; possessed, also, of a large fund of animal\r\nspirits and capacity for enjoying the pleasures of life. Within the full\r\nlimits of his rights and his position he lived his life of work and\r\npleasure, of public responsibility and of private rest and recreation.\r\nYet it was almost always in the blaze of a noon-day publicity and few,\r\nindeed, were the times and seasons in which the Heir Apparent could\r\namuse himself in any genuine _incognito_. Attempt it he might, but if\r\nany evil-minded critic were to seriously or conscientiously consider the\r\nsituation--both of which suppositions are improbable--he might have seen\r\nthat the best-known and most photographed man in the world would indeed\r\nhave been foolish to trust to an _incognito_ for any but the simplest\r\nand most innocent of objects. The actual impossibility of the Prince of\r\nWales escaping from his _entourage_, his identity, and his surroundings,\r\nwere sufficient to make Continental fictions and foreign fancies about\r\nhim absolutely farcical to those who knew something of his daily\r\nlife--aside altogether from those who knew and understood his real\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MORDAUNT CASE\r\n\r\nThere was only one matter involving moral considerations which ever\r\nemerged from the low region of back-door insinuation to the upper air\r\nand it was threshed out in a _cause celebre_--that of Lady Mordaunt. Her\r\nhusband, an English baronet, sued for divorce before the Court of\r\nDivorce and Matrimonial Causes, alleging the usual grounds, and naming\r\nas co-respondents, Viscount Cole and Sir Frederick Johnstone. The case\r\nwas heard on February 16th, 1870, and following days, and the defence on\r\nthe part of Lady Mordaunt was insanity. The Prince of Wales, though not\r\nspecified in the indictment, was so widely gossiped about as being\r\nconnected with the case that he asked to be heard and swore positively\r\nthat there had been no improper relations between himself and the\r\ndefendant. Two of the Judges on Appeal--Lord Penzance and Mr. Justice\r\nKeating--agreed with the jury's verdict that Lady Mordaunt was insane,\r\nwhile Chief Baron Kelly differed. The woman in the case was for years\r\nafterwards confined in a lunatic asylum, and it has long since been\r\nquite well understood that the only basis for scandal was the fact that\r\na Royal visit which had been paid upon one occasion was made under the\r\ninvariable rule of etiquette, which prescribes that no other caller\r\nshall be received while the visit lasts. Before and after the trouble\r\nLady Mordaunt's sisters, and especially the Dowager Countess of Dudley,\r\nwere amongst the Princess of Wales' warm friends, while the daughter of\r\nthe plaintiff in the case was, in later years, received at Sandringham,\r\nand was given many beautiful presents by the members of the Royal family\r\nupon her marriage to the Marquess of Bath. Such conditions would have\r\nbeen absolutely impossible to imagine with the Princess of Wales had she\r\nentertained the slightest belief in the stories floating about regarding\r\nthat famous trial. During the succeeding thirty years, however, there\r\nwas never even an apparent excuse for the repetition of such stories,\r\nand the happy home life of the Prince and Princess was patent to all who\r\nwere willing to believe the evidence of their eyes and ears.\r\n\r\nWhat may be said of the characteristics and habits of this many-sided\r\nheir to Royal position? Probably his first and most pronounced quality\r\nwas one of difficult definition--tactfulness. Through its means he led\r\nsociety without rivalry and with unique success; promoted reforms\r\nwithout violence of agitation or the creation of antagonisms; carried\r\nout countless varied and delicate duties, with noiseless celerity, in an\r\nage of intense and active curiosity. In forty years of ceaseless\r\npolitical change and frequently acute political crises not a whisper of\r\nhis private views became known to the million-tongued press or the\r\ncurious public. He had known every kind of partisan and been liked by\r\nleaders of the masses as well as the classes--by Joseph Arch and Henry\r\nBroadhurst, as well as by the Earl of Derby or the Marquess of\r\nSalisbury. If he visited Mr. Gladstone at Hawarden on one occasion he\r\npaid the same honour to Lord Beaconsfield at Hughenden at another time.\r\nIf Lord Randolph Churchill was a personal friend so also was Lord\r\nRosebery, or Mr. Balfour. His genial manner and sometimes cosmopolitan\r\nview of society encouraged a popular opinion as to his natural\r\ndemocracy; while a personal dignity, never forced, or assumed, but\r\nalways present, prevented the most courageous person from taking undue\r\nadvantage of the freedom from ceremonial which he sometimes liked to\r\nencourage. His preferences in international matters were as little known\r\nas his political opinions, and yet, at times, his influence in this\r\nrespect was very great.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPORTING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PRINCE\r\n\r\nThe next and perhaps most prominent characteristic of the Prince of\r\nWales was his love for sports and his embodiment of qualities which, in\r\neveryday life, constitute the English country gentleman. Some reference\r\nhas already been made to his interest in racing, yachting and shooting.\r\nBut most of the lesser sports and games were also attractive to him at\r\ndifferent periods, and there was hardly one with which he was not more\r\nor less familiar. Boating and riding in his University days and\r\nfox-hunting at Sandringham from time to time in later years, were\r\nincidents of this record. Croquet he was an expert in, but never very\r\nfond of. Lawn-tennis, when first introduced and for years afterwards,\r\nwas a game to which he was very partial, and on the _Serapis_ when\r\ntraversing the route to India he played deck-tennis until everyone else\r\nwas exhausted. The bowling-alley at Sandringham was one of the best in\r\nEngland and the Prince was always fond of a game of bowls. Quoits he\r\nplayed well, and billiards he played with frequency and skill--his\r\ndaughters being also able to handle the cue with success. Hockey was a\r\nfavourite game, especially on the lakes at Sandringham, and of this\r\nsport the other members of his family were equally fond. Skating and\r\nhockey parties were frequent during severe winter seasons and the Prince\r\nplayed in many specially arranged hockey matches--one of them against\r\nmembers of the House of Commons in the winter of 1894-5 included Mr.\r\nBalfour, Lord Stanley, Lord Willoughby de Eresby and Mr. Victor\r\nCavendish.\r\n\r\nFishing never appealed to him and was, apparently, too quiet and easy a\r\nsport. He liked pigeon-flying, and bred some very fine birds at\r\nSandringham for this purpose. Tricycling he was very fond of and kept\r\ngood machines both at Marlborough and Sandringham. As soon as motor cars\r\ncame into use he could be frequently seen driving a smart carriage along\r\nthe country roads of Norfolk. Chess the Prince never mastered nor cared\r\nfor. In dancing he was an expert, as well as in skating, and was always\r\nexceedingly fond of the amusement. At his Sandringham balls he was an\r\nindefatigable dancer, and at great balls all over the world he delighted\r\nmany a partner and varied social circle by his obvious pleasure in the\r\nentertainment. From Halifax to Montreal, from Toronto to New York, in\r\nCanada and the United States, in Egypt and India, in Turkey and Greece,\r\nin all the greater Courts of Europe, from the days of Napoleon III. at\r\nParis, to those of William II. at Berlin, he had been the central figure\r\nof some such occasions. Golf was played by His Royal Highness on the\r\nlinks of Musselburgh in early days and at a later time in Windsor Park.\r\nCricket he was fond of in his younger days, but latterly he only showed\r\nhis interest by patronizing matches as an onlooker. In these and other\r\npursuits the Prince represented in his mode of life and his manner of\r\nenjoying himself the qualities of a distinct type amongst his\r\ncountrymen and a type most popular throughout the community.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of the Prince was his good manners. The \"first\r\ngentleman in Europe\" always knew how to be pleasant without being\r\nfamiliar, dignified without being pompous, genial without being free.\r\nMyriads of stories are told in this connection. At the skating and\r\nhockey parties on the Sandringham lakes the farmers' wives and daughters\r\nwere included and no Duchess in the land would be handed a cup of tea\r\nwith more courtly manner by the Royal host than would the wife of a\r\ntenant on his estates. His servants, in houses and farms and stables, in\r\nsport or travel, at home and abroad, were treated in such a way as to\r\nmake every one of them wish to serve the Prince for a life-time. No more\r\ncharming incident is on record than the way in which His Royal Highness\r\napproached Mrs. Gladstone at the state funeral of her great husband,\r\nbowed low before her and kissed her proffered hand. Whether in high\r\ncircles, or in those of ordinary people, in expected surroundings or\r\namid unexpected conditions, the Prince seemed to always retain this\r\nfaculty of politeness in the true sense of the word--a product of heart\r\nand mind rather than of mere instruction or habit.\r\n\r\nHis manner and style of public speaking was an incident in the Prince of\r\nWales' career which exercised considerable influence upon his personal\r\npopularity. The pronounced factors in his style were not oratory,\r\ngestures, or brilliancy. Plain in matter and manner the speeches always\r\nwere; full of meat and substance they frequently were; neat and\r\neffective they were generally considered. Mr. Gladstone once went\r\nfurther than this description would seem to warrant when he declared\r\nthat there were few speakers whom he listened to with more pleasure.\r\n\"His speeches are invariably marvels of conciseness, graceful expression\r\nand clear elocution\". His voice was a good one, clear and distinct and\r\nwell-trained. Nervous in his younger days and accustomed to learn the\r\nspeeches off for delivery, he gradually changed with age and experience\r\ninto the delivery of _impromptu_ after-dinner remarks and speeches which\r\ndid not show traces of the midnight oil or earnest preparation--although\r\noften full of facts and incidents about the immense variety of subjects\r\nwith which he had to deal.\r\n\r\nIntimately connected with these characteristics of his was the\r\nunquestioned ability to judge human nature. This quality enabled the\r\nPrince to play his difficult part so well as he did, to keep him in\r\ntouch with all classes and the masses, to cultivate all the varied\r\nelements of a changing national life, and to be as much at home amongst\r\nbusiness men as at the Royal Academy--amongst the aristocracy of London\r\nas with the farmers of Norfolk. He was ever a good judge of the people\r\naround him and, perhaps, no man in modern life was so well and\r\nfaithfully served. His memory for names and faces was extraordinary and\r\nwould remind Canadians of the unique faculty in this connection\r\npossessed by the late Sir John Macdonald. He always hated affectation\r\nand toadyism and liked sincerity and simplicity. Marie Corelli, writing\r\nin 1897, used the following expressive words: \"To entertain the Prince\r\ndo little; for he is clever enough to entertain himself privately with\r\nthe folly and humbug of those he sees around him, without actually\r\nsharing in the petty comedy. He is a keen observer and must derive\r\ninfinite gratification from his constant study of men and manners, which\r\nis sufficiently deep and searching to fit him for the occupation of even\r\nthe throne of England. I say 'even', for at present, till time's great\r\nhourglass turns, it is the grandest throne in the world\".\r\n\r\nPatronage of music, art and the drama were characteristic incidents in\r\nthe life and work of the Prince. The day for helping literature had\r\nperhaps gone when he came upon the scene and newspapers were then\r\nsupposed to do for budding genius what royalty and aristocracy did for\r\nJohnson, Goldsmith, Swift or Pope. It is a curious fact of later-day\r\ndemocracy that, with the obvious exception of Kipling, most of the\r\ngreater lights in literature--Browning, Rossetti, Tennyson, Mathew\r\nArnold or Swinburne--were born with fairly comfortable means. This in\r\npassing, of course. Something has been said elsewhere as to His Royal\r\nHighness's patronage of music and there is no doubt that he taught smart\r\nsociety to support the opera, while his personal enthusiasm for Wagner\r\nwas pronounced and sincere.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THEATRE AND THE CHURCH\r\n\r\nHe patronized the theatre for many years with regularity and\r\ndiscrimination; his taste in all matters of light comedy and opera was\r\nknown to be good; and it goes without saying that his approval of a play\r\nor actor made many a reputation and fortune. He used to make his own\r\nselection of theatre or play, pay handsomely for his own box, arrive\r\npunctually on time and remain till the end, or very near it. His dislike\r\nof ostentation soon did away with the old fashion of a manager walking\r\nupstairs backward before royalty and his leaving a little early was to\r\navoid causing delay and confusion with their carriages amongst the other\r\nguests of the theatre. Actors have greatly exaggerated the extent of his\r\npatronage and friendship. But he more than once took supper with Sir\r\nHenry Irving and it is understood to have been by his advice that the\r\ngreat tragedian was knighted. He it was who encouraged the late Queen to\r\nresume her patronage of the theatre and to begin by having Mr. and Mrs.\r\nKendal appear before her at Osborne. He never liked, however, the\r\nappearance of members of the aristocracy on the stage and his daughters\r\nare said to have never taken part even in private theatricals. He is\r\nsaid to have enjoyed a private visit and smoke behind the scenes and\r\nGeorge Grossmith is stated to have been one of those who were most\r\npatronized in this respect.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of his many-sided career and character was the\r\nHeir Apparent's attention to his religious duties. At Marlborough and at\r\nSandringham prayers were read daily, in the morning, and guests, staff\r\nand servants were expected, though not compelled, to be present. On\r\nSunday the Prince invariably attended morning service either at the\r\nChapel Royal in London, or at the quaint and beautiful little Chapel of\r\nSt. Mary Magdalene, in the country. The latter was filled with handsome\r\nMemorial windows and tablets and there, for many years, worshipped the\r\nfuture King with the humblest labourers on his estate. The only\r\ndistinction made was in the private entrance for the Prince and the\r\nreserved pews for his guests and family. His daughters taught in the\r\nSunday School and the Princess had charge of the music. It has been said\r\nthat the Prince never attended Divine service on a Sunday in any but an\r\nEpiscopal church. Certainly the records of his travels and habits appear\r\nto confirm this statement. Whether in Bombay, or Montreal, or New York,\r\nhe seems to have always attended the services of the Established Church\r\nor its daughter Churches. Even in Rome, where he once spent Easter\r\nSunday, impressive ceremonies conducted by the Pope at St. Peter's did\r\nnot prevent him from attending a quiet little English church and\r\nexplaining that when members of the Church were in foreign lands they\r\nshould be especially particular in encouraging their own form of faith.\r\n\r\nOf course, as a traveller of wide experience the Prince visited all the\r\ngreat cathedrals of the Continent and was familiar with the splendid\r\nMohammedan mosques and Hindoo temples and sacred shrines which helped to\r\nmake the glittering East so attractive. But they were visited on\r\nweek-days. He was supposed to be broad in his principles as a Churchman\r\nand certainly at state weddings and funerals in other countries he\r\nshared in various forms of worship. The Princess of Wales was known to\r\nhave attended ritualistic services before her husband's accession to\r\nthe Throne, but she far more often attended Low or Broad Church\r\nservices. On Sundays at Sandringham the Prince used, in the afternoons,\r\nto walk about the grounds with his family or guests, visit the kennels,\r\nthe bear-pit, the model farms or the Princess's lovely little dairy and\r\nits suite of tiny attached rooms where tea would often be served. In\r\nLondon he would sometime attend Divine service again or else pay calls\r\nin his private hansom and then dine quietly with friends or have a few\r\nof them to dinner at Marlborough. Sunday afternoons at Sandringham were\r\nalways greatly enjoyed by Sir Frederick Leighton and Lord Beaconsfield\r\nbut Mr. Gladstone is said to have best liked long, lonely rambles\r\nthrough the woods of the estate.\r\n\r\nAn important part of the character of a man in the position so long held\r\nby the Prince of Wales is the fact of moderation, or otherwise, in\r\neating and drinking. It is a vital factor in the lives of all men but\r\nhow much more so when great banquets are for months a daily function;\r\nwhen every luxury, or delicacy, or combination of cookery known to the\r\ncivilized world and the barbaric East is at one time or another offered\r\nfor his delectation; when the power of rulers and the wealth of\r\nmillionaires are devoted to the furnishing of choice wines and\r\n_liqueurs_ and drinks for his use. The good health always enjoyed by the\r\nPrince was perhaps proof enough of his moderation at the table. His\r\nhabits in this respect became pretty well known. Tea at breakfast and in\r\nthe afternoon he always liked; Moselle cup he enjoyed and was rather\r\nproud of possessing the receipt brought from Germany by the Prince\r\nConsort; champagne for many years was almost his exclusive beverage\r\nthough afterwards claret took its place. Between meals he seldom drank\r\nanything though a well-known \"cocktail\" in the London clubs is credited\r\nto his invention. He always strongly disapproved of ladies drinking\r\nanything but a little wine and this was well understood by his own\r\nguests or by those at houses where he visited.\r\n\r\nReference must be made here to one unpleasant incident in the Prince of\r\nWales' later career--unpleasant in its results and in the comments of\r\nthe press and pulpit. To playing cards for an occasional evening's\r\namusement the Prince was always partial, but not to the extent which was\r\nsometimes asserted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARDS AND THE BACCARAT AFFAIR\r\n\r\nDuring his journeys abroad he seldom or never played and he made a\r\nstrict and early rule against playing in clubs. His friends say that he\r\nused to frequently dissuade younger men or the sons of old friends from\r\nforming a habit in this connection and as a well-known man of the world,\r\nwithout affectation and with wide experience and a naturally commanding\r\ninfluence, his views no doubt had great weight. Hence the most\r\nregrettable feature in the famous Baccarat case of 1890 which was, for a\r\ntime, one of the most talked-of and preached-at incidents in modern\r\nsocial life. To understand the matter it is necessary to look at the\r\nPrince's environment. He was the leader of society and society, together\r\nwith a large proportion of people everywhere, saw no harm in a game of\r\ncards, or even in the accompaniment of playing for ordinary money\r\nstakes, any more than they saw harm in racing and betting upon the\r\nresults, or in dancing and its accompaniment of late hours and perhaps\r\nfrivolous dissipation. Yet to many people in the United Kingdom and the\r\nEmpire danger and evil lurked in one or all of these amusements and it\r\nwas a shock to them to find that the Heir Apparent actually indulged in\r\ncard-playing; although everyone had known that he patronized the other\r\ntwo pursuits referred to.\r\n\r\nThe history of the affair may be told briefly. On September 8th, during\r\nthe Doncaster races, Mr. Arthur Wilson, a very wealthy shipowner, was\r\nentertaining a large party at Tranby Croft, near Hull, which included\r\nthe Prince of Wales, Lord Coventry, General Owen Williams, Sir William\r\nGordon-Cumming, Lord Craven, Lord and Lady Brougham and Lord Edward\r\nSomerset. When each day's racing was over and the company had returned\r\nto Tranby Croft and finished dinner, Baccarat was introduced as the\r\namusement of the evening and played for a couple of hours. The stakes\r\nwere moderate--for such a party--and ran from five shillings to ten\r\npounds. About seventeen people, ladies and gentlemen, usually sat down\r\nand the Prince of Wales was the life of the party, as he generally was,\r\nwhatever the occupation or sport. On the date mentioned, Mr. Stanley\r\nWilson, the host's son, thought he saw Sir W. Gordon-Cumming using his\r\ncounters fraudulently and informed Lord Coventry and General Williams of\r\nhis suspicions. On the third evening a committee of five--two ladies and\r\nthree gentlemen--watched the baronet and unanimously agreed that they\r\nsaw him cheating. He was privately accused of the offence, denied it\r\nvehemently, and brought the matter before the Prince, who practically\r\nacted as judge and regretfully told him that there could be no doubt of\r\nhis guilt.\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps the most difficult position the Prince of Wales had ever\r\nbeen placed in. To hand a friend and fellow-guest and well-known soldier\r\nover to justice meant in this case ruin to the man himself, disgrace to\r\ntheir host and his family and a considerable amount of discredit to the\r\nPrince. Of the latter point it is probable that the Prince thought\r\nleast, as his fidelity to friends was always well-known. Yet to let the\r\napparently guilty man go without punishment or restriction was\r\nimpossible from every standpoint. The Prince, therefore, tried to square\r\nhis duty all round by a compromise and made Sir W. Gordon-Cumming sign a\r\npledge to never play at cards again. The natural result followed where\r\nat least seven people hold a secret of much importance. It became known,\r\nor rather rumored, the resignation of the baronet from the Army was not\r\naccepted pending inquiry and, finally, he precipitated the issue by\r\nsueing the committee of five--Mrs. Arthur Wilson, Mr. Stanley Wilson,\r\nMr. and Mrs. Lycett Green and Mr. Berkeley Levett--for scandal. Sir\r\nCharles Russell acted for the defence and Sir Edward Clarke for the\r\nplaintiff and, after a sensational trial, the action was dismissed.\r\n\r\nThe case created the most intense interest and for a time His Royal\r\nHighness was the most criticised man in the United Kingdom. Press and\r\npulpit thundered forth denunciations of gambling and card-playing, and\r\nlectured the Prince upon his duty to the nation and his responsibility\r\nfor public morality. Every extreme religious speaker or writer, every\r\nRadical paper, or pamphleteer, or lecturer found the Heir to the Throne\r\nan excellent subject for abuse, while the best papers abroad teemed with\r\nreflections which could hardly be termed generous. Speaking of the\r\ncounters which had been used in these games and which were brought by\r\nthe Prince personally to Tranby Croft the New York _Tribune_ declared\r\nthat in them he had \"fingered the fragments of the Crown of England.\"\r\nUpon one point all the home papers were united and that was that in\r\ntrying to arrange and settle the matter the Prince had contravened the\r\nArmy regulations.\r\n\r\nThe better class of papers were very serious upon the subject. The\r\nLondon _Times_ declared that the Heir Apparent could not put off his\r\nresponsibilities as he did his official dress and, while admitting the\r\nassiduity and tact and good-humour with which he performed his dull\r\nround of routine duties, it yet bitterly regretted the example he had\r\nnow set. The _Daily News_ thought that the Prince had only been guilty\r\nof an indiscretion, so far as his action toward Gordon-Cumming was\r\nconcerned, but went on to say that what was blameless as an example in\r\nmeaner men, was very different in one of his exalted position. The\r\n_Standard_ denounced the whole affair from beginning to end. \"The Prince\r\nof Wales is not as other men. His position demands a sobriety, a\r\nself-restraint, and a dignity from which people of less exalted\r\nposition and lighter responsibilities are absolved.\" The religious press\r\nput no bounds to its denunciation. The _Christian World_ spoke of the\r\nmatter as an \"outrage to the public conscience\" and the _British Weekly_\r\nthought it \"enough to sober the strongest supporters of the Monarchy.\"\r\nResolutions were passed at some Church meetings of a similar character.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTERMATH OF THE INCIDENT\r\n\r\nThen the re-action came. His Royal Highness expressed to the Military\r\nauthorities and the House of Commons his apologies for an unintentional\r\ninfraction of Army regulations; it was pointed out that playing a game\r\nof cards in a private house was not setting a public example and that\r\nthe situation was so unique that any man in the Prince's place would\r\nhave been pardoned in not knowing what to do; the cause of the trouble\r\nwas dismissed from the Army and expelled from his clubs. The _Daily\r\nTelegraph_ pointed out that the carrying of the Baccarat counters, which\r\nwas apparently deemed the most serious part of the matter by many\r\ncommentators, was a very common habit with players of this game as the\r\nsymbols for money tended to moderation in playing, and were better in\r\nevery way than slips of paper. Years afterwards, Mr. Arnold White stated\r\nit as a fact that these famous bits of pasteboard were actually a\r\npresent from the Princess of Wales. The public came to feel after the\r\nfirst hasty judgment was given that, after all, the Prince had risked a\r\ngood deal for a friend and the _Observer_ went so far as to say that\r\n\"under the most difficult and trying circumstances His Royal Highness\r\nhas acted as ninety-nine Englishmen out of a hundred would have done.\"\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Charles A. Berry, the eminent Non-conformist divine,\r\ndeclared that the people were not going to be unduly severe in their\r\njudgment. \"They recognize the fact that he does a great deal of public\r\nwork and is compelled to live almost continually a life of unnatural\r\npressure. It is, therefore, to say the least, understandable that he\r\nshould seek pleasure and relaxation in some form of excitement.\"\r\n\r\nThen the issue cooled down as suddenly as the tempest had arisen, and\r\nbefore long it would have been hard to recognize that so stormy a stage\r\nof criticism had swept over the popular Prince's head. In the _Life_ of\r\nArchbishop Benson, published many years afterwards, there appeared a\r\nlong letter from the Heir Apparent in answer to a note of sympathy\r\nreceived at this time from His Grace. The Prince spoke of the \"deep pain\r\nand annoyance\" which the Baccarat incident had caused him; of the recent\r\ntrial which had given the press occasion \"to make most bitter and unjust\r\nattacks upon me, knowing I was defenceless--and I am not sure that\r\npolitics were not mixed up in it.\" Speaking of the papers and the\r\nNonconformists, who had been especially strong in their remarks, he\r\nadded some interesting expressions as to his general view of gambling.\r\n\"They have a perfect right, I am well aware, in a free country like our\r\nown, to express their opinions, but I do not consider that they have a\r\njust right to jump at conclusions regarding myself, without knowing the\r\nfacts. I have a horror of gambling, and should always do my utmost to\r\ndiscourage others who have an inclination for it, as I consider\r\ngambling, like intemperance, is one of the greatest curses which a\r\ncountry could be afflicted with. Horse-racing may produce gambling, or\r\nit may not, but I have always looked upon it as a manly sport which is\r\npopular with Englishmen of all classes, and there is no reason why it\r\nshould be looked upon as a gambling transaction. Alas, those who gamble\r\nwill gamble at anything.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the characteristics and habits and social incidents in\r\nthe career of King Edward while he was Prince of Wales. They show how\r\nentirely he shared in the life of the majority of the people--a fact all\r\nthe more illustrated in the occasions when he departed from his natural\r\nand usual course and seemed to participate in matters outside of the\r\naccepted and popular pursuits of the people. It is the picture of a man\r\nwho loved his England, liked life and its pleasures, hated humbug,\r\nenjoyed sport, did his duty as it came to him and liked the play, the\r\nrace-course and all the sports of a healthy, hearty Englishman. They\r\nprove the accuracy of that interesting description penned in his _Diary_\r\nby the King of Sweden and which, somehow, became public: \"The Heir\r\nApparent to the British Throne is Prince of Wales by name, Prince of\r\nSociety by inclination, Prince of Good Fellows by nature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nThe Prince as an Empire Statesman\r\n\r\n\r\nThe breadth of view shown by the late Prince Consort was one of his\r\ngreatest and most marked qualities. He seemed to have the faculty of\r\nseeing further into the future than most men and of preparing his own\r\nmind for developments which were yet hidden from the view of\r\ncontemporary statesmen. Hence his famous Exhibition of 1851 and the\r\nrealization of the fact that to encourage trade and commerce some\r\nknowledge of the world's products and resources was not only desirable\r\nbut necessary. Hence the early perception, which he shared with the\r\nQueen, of the coming importance of the Colonies and of the necessity of\r\nbringing the Crown into touch with those over-sea democracies which were\r\ngrowing up to nationhood in such neglected fashion and with such little\r\npractical concern in the Motherland. Hence the dislike of the Queen and\r\nhimself--because she had the statesman's understanding as well as her\r\nhusband--to the Manchester school, and their opposition to the line of\r\nthought which said that Colonies were useless except for commerce and\r\nnot much good for that. Hence the Queen's long-after regard for Lord\r\nBeaconsfield and her appreciation of his stirring and romantic\r\nImperialism.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales unquestionably inherited this capacity for\r\nstatecraft from his parents. Natural and hereditary pride in his future\r\nCrown and in the greatness of the United Kingdom was developed by\r\nteaching and study and visits into an intense pride in the vast Empire\r\nwhich grew so rapidly from year to year around his country and under\r\nits Crown. Having a broader and saner outlook than many of those about\r\nhim, without the spur of ordinary ambitions, or the hampering influence\r\nof partisan considerations, he was enabled to view this development more\r\ncarefully, wisely, and clearly than the busy diplomatist or the\r\nmuch-occupied statesman. Hence the pleasure with which he saw the\r\nImperial Federation League formed in 1884 and watched the efforts of Mr.\r\nW. E. Forster and Lord Rosebery to build upon the preliminary principles\r\nalready evolved by Lord Beaconsfield. It was not long before he saw an\r\nopportunity to promote this sentiment of unity and encourage the\r\nextension of Imperial trade. He had visited different parts of the\r\nQueen's dominions and understood something of the immense possibilities\r\nwhich were still lying dormant. His sons had since travelled over an\r\neven larger portion of the Empire and had, no doubt, in private as well\r\nas in their published journals, told him much of the more recent\r\nprogress of those great outlying communities. Contemporaneously,\r\ntherefore, with the founding of the League just mentioned, His Royal\r\nHighness proposed the holding of a great Exhibition which should meet\r\nthe new needs of the time as his father's had done in 1851. Then, the\r\ninterests of British trade were cosmopolitan and Colonial development\r\nslight and unimportant to the immediate concerns of England. Now,\r\nBritish commerce was contracting with foreign countries and steadily\r\ngrowing with British countries. Hence the new Exhibition should, he\r\nthought, be confined to British resources and products and be Imperial\r\ninstead of international.\r\n\r\nOn November 10th, 1884, the Queen issued a Royal Commission to arrange\r\nfor the holding of an Exhibition of the products, manufactures and arts\r\nof Her Majesty's Colonial and Indian dominions in the year 1886. The\r\nPrince of Wales was to be President and Sir Philip Cunliffe-Owen,\r\nSecretary, of the Commission. The first meeting took place at\r\nMarlborough House on March 30th, 1885, with His Royal Highness in the\r\nchair. Amongst the members present were F. M. the Duke of Cambridge, the\r\nMarquess of Salisbury, the Marquess of Lorne, the Earl of Derby, the\r\nEarl of Dalhousie, Earl Cadogan, the Earl of Kimberley, the Earl of\r\nLytton, F. M. Lord Strathnairn, Mr. Edward Stanhope, Sir Stafford\r\nNorthcote, Mr. W. E. Forster, Sir M. E. Hicks-Beach, Sir H. T. Holland,\r\nSir John Rose, Sir R. G. W. Herbert, Sir Charles Tupper of Canada, Sir\r\nArthur Blyth of South Australia, Sir F. D. Bell of New Zealand, Sir Saul\r\nSamuel of New South Wales, Mr. Charles Mills of Cape Colony, Mr. R.\r\nMurray Smith of Victoria, Mr. James F. Garrick of Queensland, Sir W. C.\r\nSeargeant, Sir G. C. M. Birdwood and many other distinguished\r\nrepresentatives of British, Colonial and Indian interests. In the course\r\nof his somewhat lengthy speech detailing the objects of the movement and\r\nthe methods of operation, the Prince described the proposed Exhibition\r\nas one by which the \"reproductive resources\" of the Colonies and India\r\nwould be brought before the British people and the different countries\r\nconcerned be able to \"compare the advance made by each other in trade,\r\nmanufactures and general material progress\". He pointed out the desire\r\nof the Motherland to participate in the development of Colonial material\r\ninterests and then added: \"We must remember that, as regards the\r\nColonies, they are the legitimate and natural homes, in future, of the\r\nmore adventurous and energetic portion of the population of these\r\nIslands.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary announced that the preliminary list of guarantees provided\r\nfor £128,000, including £20,000 from the Government of India, £10,000\r\nfrom that of Canada, £19,000 from the various Australasian Governments\r\nand £1000 each from individual subscribers such as Lord Cadogan, Sir\r\nThomas Brassey, Sir Daniel Cooper, the Earl of Derby, Mr. Henry\r\nDoulton, Sir J. Whittaker Ellis, Mr. Samuel Morley and the Earl of\r\nRosebery. This latter list indicated in a most marked manner the\r\npersonal influence of the Prince of Wales. On May 3, 1886, the eve of\r\nthe formal opening of the Exhibition was marked by a meeting of the\r\nRoyal Commission at which the Prince presided, sketched the history and\r\nprogress of an undertaking to which he had given much time and intimated\r\nthat the guarantee fund now amounted to £218,000, of which the City of\r\nLondon had recently voted £10,000. In proposing a vote of thanks to the\r\nRoyal chairman, seconded by Earl Granville, the Duke of Cambridge said:\r\n\"It is not the first time that His Royal Highness has acted as President\r\nin undertakings of this nature, and it is very difficult for any person\r\nto praise him in his presence without appearing fulsome; but it is not\r\nfulsome to say that he has always devoted his whole energies to bringing\r\neverything to a successful issue with which he is connected.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING AND SUCCESS OF THE EXHIBITION\r\n\r\nThe Colonial and Indian Exhibition was opened on the following day at\r\nSouth Kensington by Her Majesty the Queen in the presence of an immense\r\ngathering, representative of all parts of the British realm. It was, in\r\nfact, the first of those great fêtes with which the people became so\r\nfamiliar in the next two decades and which did so much to unify and\r\ntypify the power of the Empire. In the brilliant throng surrounding the\r\nQueen and the Prince of Wales, as the latter read an elaborate address\r\nof loyal welcome, were the members of the Government, the various\r\nForeign Ambassadors, distinguished men in every walk of life,\r\nrepresentatives of Colonies and British islands in all parts of the\r\nworld--Lord Salisbury, Lord Rosebery, Lord Cranbrook, the Earl of\r\nNorthbrook, the Dukes of Manchester, Buckingham and Abercorn, the Earl\r\nof Iddesleigh, Lord Granville, the Earl of Kimberley, Lord Napier of\r\nMagdala, Sir M. E. Hicks-Beach, Sir F. Leighton, Sir Charles Tupper and\r\nMr. Hector Fabre from Canada, Sir Alexander Stuart, Sir Arthur Blyth,\r\nSir Samuel Davenport, the Hon. James F. Garrick and the Hon. Malcolm\r\nFraser, from Australia, Sir Lyon Playfair, Sir Richard Cross, Sir\r\nWilliam Harcourt, Lord Wolseley, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Mr. H. C.\r\nE. Childers, the Maharajah of Johore, Rustem Pasha, Count Hatzfeldt,\r\nEarl Spencer, and many others. Madame Albani sang that splendid ode by\r\nLord Tennyson beginning:\r\n\r\n    \"Welcome, welcome with one voice\r\n    In your welfare we rejoice,\r\n    Sons and brothers that have sent,\r\n    From isle and cape and continent\r\n    Produce of your field and flood,\r\n    Mount and mine and primal wood,\r\n    Works of subtle brain and hand\r\n    And splendours of the Morning Land,\r\n    Gifts from every British zone\r\n    Britons, hold your own!\"\r\n\r\nThe National Anthem was first sung in English and then in Sanskrit as a\r\ncompliment to the Indian visitors. The address read by the Prince of\r\nWales referred to the origin and progress of the project, to the\r\ndevelopment of the Colonies, to the late Prince Consort's interest in\r\nExhibitions and to his own position as President of the present Royal\r\nCommission, and concluded as follows: \"It is our heartfelt prayer that\r\nan undertaking intended to illustrate and record this development may\r\ngive a stimulus to the commercial interests and intercourse of all parts\r\nof Your Majesty's dominions; that it may be the means of augmenting that\r\nwarm affection and brotherly sympathy which is reciprocated by all Your\r\nMajesty's subjects; and that it may still further deepen that steadfast\r\nloyalty which we, who dwell in the Mother Country, share with our\r\nkindred who have elsewhere so nobly done honour to her name.\" The\r\nQueen's reply expressed an earnest hope that the Exhibition would\r\nencourage the arts of peace and industry and strengthen the bonds of\r\nunion within the Empire. An interesting feature of the proceedings was\r\nthe receipt of a telegram from Sir Patrick Jennings, Premier of New\r\nSouth Wales, expressing that Colonial Government's \"thanks and\r\nappreciation to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales for the profound\r\ninterest\" he had shown in the success of the great project now so\r\nauspiciously opened. The London _Times_ on the following day spoke of\r\nthe \"energy and devotion\" of the Prince in this connection, and the\r\npress as a whole at home and in the external Empire joined in\r\ncongratulating him upon the issue.\r\n\r\nThe Exhibition was a great success in every way. Over five and a half\r\nmillion visitors were recorded and the Queen helped, personally, to\r\nmaintain public interest in it by herself visiting the various Sections\r\nrepeatedly. The final meeting of the Royal Commission was held at\r\nMarlborough House on April 30th, 1897 and the Prince of Wales submitted\r\nan elaborate and exhaustive Report which was afterwards published. In\r\nhis own remarks the President pointed out that the project had served\r\nits main purpose in very largely promoting knowledge of the Empire's\r\nresources and products and that, incidentally, its success had given the\r\nmanagement a surplus of £35,000. This sum, he suggested, should be\r\nlargely devoted to the advancement of the project for a permanent\r\nExhibition or Imperial Institute--\"in the promotion of which the Queen\r\nand I both take so warm an interest.\" Later in the evening the Prince\r\nexpressed the hope that as the late Exhibition had been, allegorically,\r\nburnt that day, \"the Imperial Institute may be a Phoenix rising out of\r\nits ashes. I trust that it may be a lasting memorial not only of that\r\nbut of the Jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen.\" Of the sum mentioned,\r\n£25,000 was accordingly voted to the new project.\r\n\r\nThe proposal of the Heir Apparent--as first expressed in a letter to\r\nthe Lord Mayor on September 13, 1886--was that the idea evolved in the\r\nExhibition should be made permanent and be embodied in an Imperial\r\nInstitute which should be at once a visible emblem of the unity of the\r\nEmpire, a place for illustrating its vast resources, a museum for\r\nexhibiting its varied and changing products and industries, a centre of\r\ninformation and communication for all British countries, an aid to the\r\nincrease and distribution of national wealth, a medium for combining in\r\njoint co-operation older and smaller institutions of tried utility, and\r\na fitting national memorial of the Queen's Jubilee. The movement\r\ndeveloped steadily and, on January 12th, 1887, a gathering was held at\r\nKensington Palace, upon invitation of the Prince of Wales, and was one\r\nof the most representative over which even he had ever presided. Amongst\r\nthose present were Lord Herschell, Chairman of the Organizing Committee,\r\nthe Earl of Carnarvon, Lord Revelstoke, Lord Rothschild, Sir Lyon\r\nPlayfair, Sir H. T. Holland, Sir John Rose, Sir Henry James, the Right\r\nHon. H. H. Fowler, Sir Frederick Leighton, Sir Charles Tupper, Sir Saul\r\nSamuel, Sir Edward Guinness, Sir Ashley Eden, Sir Owen T. Bourne, Sir\r\nReginald Hanson, Lord Mayor of London, Mr. J. H. Tritton, Chairman of\r\nthe London Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Pattison Currie, Chairman of the\r\nBank of England, Sir Frederick Abel, Mr. Neville Lubbock, Lord Campden,\r\nthe Lord Provost of Edinburgh, the Lord Mayor of York, the Mayor of\r\nNewcastle and nearly two hundred other mayors, or chief magistrates, of\r\nBritish towns.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales was accompanied by Prince Albert Victor and spoke at\r\nlength upon the objects to be served and the progress already made in\r\nthe matter which he had so much at heart. \"It occurred to me that the\r\nrecent Colonial and Indian Exhibition, which presented a most successful\r\ndisplay of the material resources of the Colonies and India, might\r\nsuggest the basis for an Institute which should afford a permanent\r\nrepresentation of the products and manufactures of the Queen's\r\ndominions. I, therefore, appointed a Committee of eminent men to\r\nconsider and report to me upon the best means of carrying out this\r\nidea.\" So much for the initiation of the scheme. The Report had been\r\nduly submitted and accepted and he now invited co-operation and\r\nassistance in establishing and maintaining the proposed \"Imperial\r\nInstitute of the United Kingdom, the Colonies and India.\" His Royal\r\nHighness pointed out that no less than sixteen million persons had\r\nattended the four Exhibitions over which he had presided--the Fisheries,\r\nHealtheries, Inventories and Colinderies, as they were popularly\r\ncalled--and expressed the strong belief that they had added greatly to\r\nthe knowledge of the people and largely stimulated the industries of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nINITIATION OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE\r\n\r\n\"My proposals are that the Imperial Institute be an emblem of the unity\r\nof the Empire and illustrate the resources and capabilities of every\r\nsection of Her Majesty's dominions.\" The Colonies and Motherland would\r\nthus teach other and emigration would also be greatly aided along\r\nBritish channels. He believed that the work upon which he had entered in\r\nthis connection would be of lasting benefit to this and future\r\ngenerations and, after a careful review of the whole situation, declared\r\nthat \"from the close relation in which I stand to the Queen there can be\r\nno impropriety in my stating that if her subjects desire, on the\r\noccasion of the celebration of her fiftieth year as Sovereign of this\r\ngreat Empire, to offer her a memorial of their love and loyalty, she\r\nwould specially value one which would promote the industrial and\r\ncommercial resources of her dominions in various parts of the world and\r\nwhich would be expressive of that unity and co-operation which Her\r\nMajesty desires should prevail amidst all classes and races of her\r\nextended Empire.\"\r\n\r\nA public meeting at the Mansion House followed with the Lord Mayor in\r\nthe chair and was addressed by Earl Granville, Mr. A. J. Mundella, Mr.\r\nG. J. Goschen, and others. Strong resolutions of support and approval\r\nwere passed, many telegrams of sympathy with the object announced, and a\r\nstatement of initial subscriptions given which included the names of\r\nLord Rothschild, Sir W. J. Clarke of Australia and Lord Revelstoke.\r\nDuring the next six years the project was steadily pressed forward;\r\nlarge individual subscriptions obtained by the personal influence of the\r\nPrince of Wales, supplemented by the growing sympathy with the Colonies\r\nand with Empire unity; while grants were given by the British, Indian\r\nand Colonial Governments. Gradually, the splendid building in South\r\nKensington, known over the world as the Imperial Institute, approached\r\ncompletion and, on May 9th, 1893, was opened by the Queen amidst stately\r\nceremonial and all the trappings of regal magnificence. Nearly all the\r\nRoyal family were present and, in the progress through the streets, a\r\nparticularly enthusiastic reception was given to the Duke of York and\r\nPrincess May of Teck whose engagement had been very recently announced.\r\nAround Her Majesty and the Prince of Wales, as the latter presented the\r\naddress of the Committee, were ranged the most representative men of\r\nEngland, many Ambassadors, and Indian Princes and Colonial statesmen.\r\nLord Salisbury, Mr. A. J. Balfour, Mr. H. H. Asquith, Sir William\r\nHarcourt, Lord Rosebery and Lord Randolph Churchill were there, but not\r\nMr. Gladstone. After a brief description, in the address, of the objects\r\nand history of the Institute, the Prince continued as follows: \"We\r\nventure to express a confident anticipation that the Imperial Institute\r\nwill not only be a record of the growth of the Empire and of the\r\nmarvellous advance of its people in industrial and commercial\r\nprosperity during Your Majesty's reign but will, also, tend to increase\r\nthat prosperity by stimulating enterprise and promoting the technical\r\nand scientific knowledge which is now so essential to industrial\r\ndevelopment.\" After some brief words from Her Majesty the great building\r\nwas declared open and another important project initiated by the Prince\r\nof Wales had reached completion. The London _Times_ of the succeeding\r\nday referred with accuracy, in this connection, to his \"clear-sighted\r\ninitiative and untiring energy\" and a member of the Executive Committee,\r\nwhich had the enterprise in hand, wrote to the same paper that during\r\nthe past six years \"every important step in connection with the\r\nInstitute has been taken under the immediate direction of the Prince of\r\nWales. By his energy men have been moved to action and difficulties\r\napparently insuperable have been overcome. The result of years of\r\ndevoted labour was accomplished to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY ADVOCACY OF IMPERIALISM\r\n\r\nThese were the two chief products of what may be called the Empire\r\nstatesmanship of the Prince of Wales. Long before either of them were\r\nundertaken, however, he had shown a deep and sincere interest in the\r\nunity of the Empire--a natural outcome of his training, his travels, his\r\nindividual abilities. For many years he acted as President of the Royal\r\nColonial Institute, accepting the position at a time when people were\r\nonly beginning to awake to the fact that Great Britain was more than an\r\nIsland and sea-power and when the Institute was the rallying ground and\r\ncentre for a small group of men like the late Duke of Manchester, Lord\r\nBury, Mr. W. E. Forster and Sir Frederick Young, who devoted much energy\r\nand enthusiasm to the promotion of what long afterwards became known as\r\nImperialism. The patronage and support of His Royal Highness did very\r\nmuch to give the movement, in its earlier days, a place and an influence\r\nand to establish the Institute as the factor which history has since\r\nrecognized it to have been. It was in this connection, on July 16th,\r\n1881, that the Lord Mayor of London--Sir William McArthur\r\nM.P.--entertained the Prince of Wales at a banquet attended by many\r\nrepresentatives of the Colonies and distinguished guests. In his speech\r\nthe Prince referred with extreme regret to his not having been able to\r\nvisit all the Colonies, and especially, Australia. He had greatly\r\ndesired to accept the invitation extended to him two years before to\r\nvisit the Exhibitions at Sydney and Melbourne. \"Though, my Lords and\r\ngentlemen I have not had the opportunity of seeing those great\r\nAustralian Colonies, which every day and every year are making such\r\nimmense development, still, at the International Exhibitions of London,\r\nParis and Vienna, I had not only an opportunity of seeing their various\r\nproducts then exhibited, but I had the pleasure of making the personal\r\nacquaintance of many Colonists--a fact which has been a matter of great\r\nimportance and great benefit to myself.\"\r\n\r\nA further reference was made to the sending of his sons to visit\r\nAustralia and memories of his own tour of British America were revived,\r\nwith an expression of special gratification at seeing his \"old friend,\"\r\nSir John Macdonald, Prime Minister of Canada, present on this occasion.\r\nIn August, 1887, the Prince of Wales showed further and practical\r\ninterest in Australia by accepting the post of President of the Royal\r\nCommission appointed by the Queen, in England, to promote and help the\r\nMelbourne Exhibition of 1888. The Earl of Rosebery acted as\r\nVice-President and much was done in making the British exhibit a good\r\none. Years before this, speaking at the laying of the foundation stone\r\nof the first Melbourne Exhibition--February 19th, 1879--the Governor of\r\nVictoria, Sir George F. Bowen, declared it to be well-known that the\r\nHeir Apparent was animated by \"a desire to visit the Australian Colonies\r\nin person should high reasons of state permit.\" As illustrating the\r\nopinions formed of him by colonial statesmen, the following may be\r\nquoted from the autobiography of that uncouth, clever, patriotic\r\npersonality, Sir Henry Parkes: \"I met His Royal Highness on several\r\noccasions in London, and he struck me as possessing in a remarkable\r\ndegree the princely faculty of doing the right thing and saying the\r\nright word.\"\r\n\r\nAnother matter to which the Prince of Wales gave an Imperial character\r\nwas the Royal College of Music which he initiated, organized and finally\r\ninaugurated on May 7th, 1883. Upon the latter occasion he explained in\r\nhis speech that the institution was open to the whole Empire, that\r\nscholarships had already been provided by Victoria and South Australia,\r\nand that he hoped it might become an Imperial centre of musical\r\neducation as well as a British centre. \"The object I have in view is\r\nessentially Imperial as well as national, and I trust that ere long\r\nthere will be no Colony of any importance which is not represented by a\r\nscholar at the Royal College.\" During the years which followed, up to\r\nthe time of his accession to the Throne, the interest of the Prince of\r\nWales in everything that helped Imperial unity was continuous and most\r\nearnest. At the Jubilee periods of 1887 and 1897, he entertained many\r\nColonial statesmen, as he had done at other times when opportunity\r\nserved, and he was always delighted to meet them and to discuss the\r\naffairs of their countries with men who naturally knew them best. It was\r\na process of mental equipment for the government of a vast empire which,\r\nin addition to his early travels, must have made the experience and\r\nknowledge of Queen Victoria's successor as unique as were the conditions\r\nand greatness of his Empire.\r\n\r\nDuring the last Jubilee the Prince presided, on June 18th, as President\r\nof the Imperial Institute, at a banquet given to the Colonial Premiers\r\nand other representatives in London. Upon his right sat Sir Wilfrid\r\nLaurier, Premier of Canada, and upon his left Mr. Whitelaw Reid, the\r\nspecial Envoy of the United States. Amongst others present were Lord\r\nSalisbury, Sir Hugh Nelson, Premier of Queensland, the Marquess of\r\nLansdowne, Lord Rosebery and Mr. Chamberlain--all of whom spoke; while\r\nLord Ripon, Lord Dufferin, Lord Kimberley, the Marquess of Lorne, Sir W.\r\nV. Whiteway, Premier of Newfoundland, Lord Rothschild, Sir Donald Smith\r\n(Lord Strathcona) the Archbishop of Canterbury and a splendid array of\r\nother representative men in Church and State, army and navy, art and\r\nscience and literature, were also present. In one of his tactful\r\nspeeches on this occasion, His Royal Highness referred to the enormous\r\ngrowth of the Colonies during the Queen's record reign and expressed the\r\nhope that present peaceful conditions might long continue. \"God grant\r\nit,\" he added, \"but if the national flag is threatened I am convinced\r\nthat all the Colonies will unite to maintain what exists and to preserve\r\nthe unity of the Empire.\" In little more than a year these words were\r\nfully borne out by events.\r\n\r\nBut the Prince of Wales was never content to make mere speeches in\r\nadvocacy of a principle. His aid to the Royal Colonial Institute and\r\norganization of the Imperial Institute were cases in point. When the\r\nImperial Federation League was formed he could only help its aims\r\nindirectly because there were political possibilities in its platform,\r\nbut when, in 1896, the British Empire League succeeded to its place and\r\nmission, with a broader and more general platform, the Queen and the\r\nPrince extended their patronage to the organization. On April 30, 1900,\r\na great banquet was given under its auspices to welcome the Australian\r\nDelegates who had gone \"home\" to discuss the Commonwealth Act, and to\r\nrecognize the services rendered by Colonial troops in the South African\r\nwar. The Duke of Devonshire occupied the chair, with the Prince of Wales\r\nand the Duke of York on either hand, and next to them again the Dukes of\r\nCambridge and Fife. The Marquess of Salisbury, Lieutenant Colonel\r\nGeorge T. Denison, President of the League in Canada, Mr. Chamberlain,\r\nMr. Edmund Barton of Australia and Mr. J. Israel Tarte of Canada were\r\namongst the speakers, and others present included the Right Hon. C. C.\r\nKingston, the Hon. Alfred Deakin, the Hon. J. R. Dickson, Sir John\r\nCockburn and Sir James Blyth of Australia, the Earl of Hopetoun, Lord\r\nLansdowne, Lord Wolseley, Lord Knutsford, Lord Strathcona, the Earl of\r\nOnslow, the Earl of Jersey, the Earl of Crewe, Lord Kelvin and Earl\r\nGrey. The Prince of Wales was enthusiastically received and\r\ncongratulated upon his recent escape from assassination at Brussels.\r\nAfter some eloquently appropriate remarks upon this point, he welcomed\r\nthe Australians in kindly words and then referred to the war. \"We little\r\ndoubt,\" he went on, \"that in a great war like the one we are now waging\r\nwe should have at any rate the sympathy of our Colonies; but it has\r\nexceeded even our expectations. We know now the feeling that existed in\r\nour Colonies and that they have sent their best material, their best\r\nblood and manhood, to fight with us, side by side, for the honour of the\r\nflag and for the maintenance of our Empire.\" Such words may fittingly\r\nconclude a brief record of the Prince of Wales' interest in Empire\r\naffairs up to the time of his accession to the Throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nThe Prince as Heir Apparent\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Heir to a Throne such as that of Great Britain has an exceptionally\r\ndifficult place to fill. He has to have the broad sympathies and\r\nknowledge and training of a statesman without the right to express\r\nhimself upon any of the political problems and issues of his time; he\r\nhas to live in a never-ending blaze of publicity and be liable to\r\nunscrupulous, or too scrupulous, criticism without the power of direct\r\nreply; he has, perhaps, to suffer in private life and character from the\r\ncaustic shafts of men at home or abroad who do not like the institution\r\nwhich he represents; he has to officiate in a ceaseless round of\r\nfunctions and public ceremonial; he has to travel constantly from Court\r\nto Court in Europe and, in the case of the Prince of Wales, he had to\r\nact for several decades the part of the Sovereign in public life without\r\nthe resources or responsibilities which the actual ruler would naturally\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, important compensations. He has the foremost place\r\nin every leading national event, the privilege of knowing as intimately\r\nas he pleases the great men of his own and other countries, in every\r\nline of statecraft and human attainment, the pleasure of travel in many\r\nlands and amongst varied scenes and people, the opportunity of taking up\r\nany matter of a non-political character which he deems useful to the\r\nstate, the people, or the Empire, with a reasonable certainty of\r\nsubstantial backing. To succeed, however, in the position as did Albert\r\nEdward, Prince of Wales, demands a peculiar combination of qualities\r\nwhich very few men possess in any rank of life. Tact, self-restraint,\r\nself-reliance, knowledge of human nature, energy, dignity, good\r\nintentions earnest patriotism, are more or less necessary.\r\n\r\nHow seldom these qualities have all been possessed by Heirs to the\r\nBritish Throne is plain upon the pages of history. There have been\r\namongst them seventeen Princes of Wales of whom the best, before the\r\nchief of the line, was the Black Prince, and of whom only four have\r\nreached the Throne since the time of Edward VI. They were Charles I,\r\nCharles II, George II, and George IV., and the careers of the last two\r\nconsisted in the establishment of rival Courts, continuous disagreements\r\nwith their fathers, the headship of political factions, and the\r\npossession of characters about which the least said the better. The\r\nPrince who became Edward VII. may be said to have created the position\r\nof Heir Apparent, as his Royal mother created that of a modern\r\nconstitutional Monarch.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE POSITION\r\n\r\nHe established himself as a sort of advisory statesman to the nation, an\r\nabsolutely impartial leader in questions of high, as distinct from party\r\npolitics, the first gentleman in the land in society, sports and\r\nmanners, the leader of philanthropic projects and social reforms. He\r\nbecame the busiest man in England, the most popular personality in the\r\nthree kingdoms, the head and front of many important public\r\nundertakings. Such a development was new to British institutions, but it\r\ncame about so gradually that only when he ascended the Throne did people\r\nfully realize how large a place the Prince of Wales had held in public\r\naffairs as well as in their affections. Mr. Chauncey M. Depew, the\r\neloquent American Senator, expressed the personal side of the matter\r\nvery well when he said, with some surprise, after first meeting His\r\nRoyal Highness: \"I met a thoughtful dignitary filling to the brim the\r\nrequirements of his exalted position. In fact, a practical as well as a\r\ntheoretical student of the mighty forces which control the government of\r\nall great countries and make their best history.\"\r\n\r\nThere were many sides to this career, and in some of them the Prince\r\nnever received the credit which he deserved. One was the essentially\r\nbusiness-like management of his financial affairs. From the time of\r\nattaining his majority the Heir Apparent received £40,000 a year by\r\ngrant of Parliament; at his marriage a special grant of £10,000 was\r\ngiven the Princess of Wales; when their children grew up the Prince was\r\ngiven £36,000 to apportion amongst them as he saw fit. During his\r\nminority the wise management of the revenues of the Duchy of\r\nCornwall--which is an hereditary appurtenance of the Prince of Wales--by\r\nthe late Prince Consort, gave the Heir Apparent a total of £600,000, of\r\nwhich £220,000 were expended upon the purchase of Sandringham, and a\r\nconsiderable sum upon improvements there. On the Prince's marriage he\r\nwas voted £23,455 to defray expenses and his allowance for the Indian\r\ntour of 1875 was £142,000 of which £69,000 was for presents. Marlborough\r\nHouse was given him by the nation, though he paid taxes upon it like any\r\nother citizen. The Duchy of Cornwall was so well managed after it came\r\nunder his control that it yielded in 1897 a total income of nearly\r\n£74,000, or almost double the value of the returns received forty years\r\nbefore. Birk Hall, an estate inherited from the Prince Consort, was sold\r\nto the Queen for £120,000. The total public income of the Prince of\r\nWales during many years was about £180,000, or nearly a million dollars,\r\nand the management of his finances was always careful. The stories of\r\nextravagance and indebtedness were absolutely without foundation. Yet\r\nthese tales of poverty were always widespread and were probably believed\r\nby many millions of people.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that he was a first-rate business man in money affairs,\r\nknew how to make his income go to its furthest extent, and had an\r\nestablished system on his estates and in his palaces which combined\r\ncomfort and luxury with judicious economy. A few words upon this point\r\nmay be quoted, in passing, from an article in the well-known _Ladies\r\nHome Journal_ of Philadelphia, written in July, 1897, by Mr. George W.\r\nSmalley, an American critic of authority who lived in London for many\r\nyears: \"It is not a subject which I care to touch upon, but I may refer\r\nto the stories about the Prince of Wales' financial position. It is a\r\nmatter with which the American public has absolutely no concern.\r\nNevertheless all sorts of stories are printed here about his debts to\r\nthis person or that. Such stories were circulated when Baron Hirsch\r\ndied--so circumstantial that they must have either been based upon\r\nminute knowledge or have been pure fabrications. They were not based\r\nupon knowledge, minute or otherwise, because they were not true.\" These\r\nstories were rendered more absurd by the fact that a rough calculation\r\nof his receipts during forty years of public life would indicate a sum\r\nof between thirty and forty millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARITIES OF THE PRINCE\r\n\r\nOf course the expenses of the Heir Apparent were very great even when\r\nthose are excepted which the nation paid. His personal gifts to\r\nbenevolent institutions, educational concerns, religious interests,\r\nobjects of social, moral and physical improvement, hospitals and\r\ninfirmaries, asylums, orphanages, commercial and agricultural\r\norganizations, the relief of children and foreigners in distress, deaf\r\nand dumb and blind institutions, memorials and statues, Indian famines,\r\nwar funds, calamity funds of various kinds at home, in the Colonies, and\r\nabroad, have been reckoned by an English student of statistics at £3,200\r\na year, or £128,000 in forty years--$640,000 spent in response to public\r\nappeals alone without reference to the many private charities about\r\nwhich little was known except that a very large amount of assistance\r\nwas given yearly by the Prince and Princess in response to all kinds of\r\nprivate and authenticated requests. In this general connection Mr.\r\nGladstone, when Prime Minister, spoke very warmly during the\r\nParliamentary discussion of 1889 upon the Royal grants of that year. \"It\r\nwill be admitted,\" he said in the course of his somewhat famous speech,\r\n\"that circumstances have tended to throw upon the Prince of Wales an\r\namount of public work in connection with institutions as well as with\r\nceremonials, which was larger than could reasonably have been expected,\r\nand with regard to which every call has been honourably and devotedly\r\nmet from a sense of public duty.\"\r\n\r\nReference has been made in the preceding pages to the infinitely varied\r\npublic functions of His Royal Highness and the aid thus given to\r\ncharities and benevolent objects. A few instances only were quoted in\r\nwhich many thousands of pounds were obtained for worthy objects through\r\nhis patronage. The fact is that the Heir Apparent gave his position a\r\nrather unique characteristic in this respect by becoming a sort of Grand\r\nAlmoner of the nation. Almost any charity which he patronized or which\r\nthe Princess supported with his approval, became a success, and it is\r\nprobable that every thousand pounds which he gave away became a hundred\r\nthousand pounds through the _prestige_ of his example and his often\r\nvigorous and effective personal exertions. One of the interests to which\r\nhe was most devoted was that of the London and other hospitals.\r\nAttendance at the festivals, or annual dinners, was frequent, and the\r\nconsequent subscription to their funds from time to time considerable.\r\nDuring the Diamond Jubilee the Prince thought he saw in this cause a way\r\nto fittingly commemorate that great event--as he had already marked that\r\nof 1887 by the Imperial Institute.\r\n\r\nUnder date of February 5th, 1897, therefore, an elaborate statement and\r\nearnest appeal appeared in the London _Times_ and other great papers\r\nsigned by the Prince of Wales, and asking for organized help in making\r\nup the existing deficits of £100,000 in London hospitals. The Royal\r\nwriter pointed out that the efforts of individual institutions,\r\npraiseworthy as they had been, failed to obtain more than a small number\r\nof subscriptions from the great population of the metropolis; that the\r\nreasons for this was partly the difficulty of choosing amongst so many\r\nuseful charities, partly the lack of definite opportunity for giving\r\nannual subscriptions to the cause as a whole, partly a feeling that\r\nsmall sums were not worth contributing; that it was proposed to\r\nestablish this \"Prince of Wales Hospital Fund\" in order to commemorate\r\nthe 60th anniversary of the Queen's reign by obtaining permanent annual\r\nsubscriptions of from £100,000 to £150,000. He also announced that Lord\r\nRothschild had accepted the post of Treasurer, that a commencement in\r\nsubscriptions had been made, and that the Lord Mayor had promised his\r\nactive assistance.\r\n\r\nThe success of the movement thus inaugurated by the Heir Apparent was\r\npronounced. The annual Report of the Council of the Fund, which was\r\nissued on May 2nd, 1899, stated that during the past two years £89,000\r\nhad been distributed, and that the hospitals had been enabled to re-open\r\nand maintain two hundred and forty-two beds. It had, however, not come\r\nup yet to the requirements and, on March 1st, of this year, the Prince\r\nmade another effort to help the hospitals. He called a large and\r\nrepresentative meeting at Marlborough House, and placed before it a plan\r\nfor the establishment of an Order to be called the League of Mercy. Its\r\nobject would be to reach locally persons who did not subscribe to minor\r\nFunds, or individual institutions, and to do this by offering an honour\r\nin the form of this decoration, \"as a reward for gratuitous personal\r\nservices rendered in the relief of sickness, suffering, poverty or\r\ndistress.\" These services would be apart, altogether, from gifts of\r\nmoney, (although the latter would be gladly accepted) and must be\r\ncontinued during five years. The Queen was to be head of the Order and\r\nthe Heir Apparent its Grand President. All names were to be submitted to\r\nHer Majesty and the honour itself was not to confer any rank, dignity or\r\nsocial precedence. The plan was approved, and its success marked despite\r\nsome caustic and unjust criticisms in certain Radical papers. On\r\nDecember 1st (1899), following, the annual meeting of the Hospital Fund\r\nwas held at Marlborough House, with His Royal Highness in the chair, and\r\nattended by Lord Rowton, Lord Iveagh, Cardinal Vaughan, Lord Lister,\r\nLord Reay, the Chief Rabbi and others. Lord Rothschild submitted a\r\nstatement which showed the year's receipts to be £47,000, the first\r\ndistribution from the League of Mercy to be £1,000, and the total amount\r\nof the Fund to be £217,000. The meeting of December 18th, in the\r\nfollowing year, showed receipts of £49,468; of which £6,000 came from\r\nthe League of Mercy. In his speech upon this occasion Lord Rothschild\r\nheartily congratulated the Royal chairman upon his \"wisdom and\r\nforesight\" in forming this League. In passing, it may be said that\r\nGrey's Hospital, London, was one of the individual institutions which\r\nthe Prince undertook personally to help, and at one special banquet, at\r\nwhich he presided for this purpose, he was enabled to announce total\r\nsubscriptions to the extraordinary amount of £151,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE AND THE WORKINGMEN\r\n\r\nThere was no part of his public career more creditable to the Prince of\r\nWales than his sincere, unforced friendship and sympathy with the\r\nworkingman. Like his philanthropic work, it was the natural product of a\r\ngenerous disposition, and won the honest liking of men who had always\r\nlooked with suspicion upon aristocratic, to say nothing of Royal,\r\nefforts in their behalf. This was another illustration of the difference\r\nbetween Heirs Apparent to the Throne. Imagination fails to grasp the\r\nthought of the Stuarts or the Georges, when holding that position,\r\ntrying to help the poor or uplift the labourer! Speaking at a meeting in\r\nLondon on January 12th, 1887, Lord Mayor, Sir Reginald Hanson, said:\r\n\"All those who have been engaged in this scheme (the Imperial Institute)\r\nknow that the Prince of Wales is one of the first in this country who\r\nlooks to the interests of the working classes.\" For many years, indeed,\r\nhe had been an annual subscriber to the Workingmen's Club and Institute\r\nUnion and to the Workingmen's College in Great Ormond Street. In the\r\nAlexandra Trust, founded by Sir Thomas Lipton, at the instance of the\r\nPrincess, much interest was taken by the Heir Apparent as well as his\r\nwife, and, on March 15th, 1900, they privately and unexpectedly visited\r\nthe Restaurant in City Road and inspected this praiseworthy effort to\r\nsupply wholesome food at low prices to the poor. After walking about and\r\nspeaking to many of the people, they enjoyed a \"three-course dinner\"\r\ncosting four pence half-penny, and left amid a scene of great\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nMore than once the Prince aided workingmen's institutions by visiting\r\nthem. On one occasion he heard that an Exhibition in South London,\r\npromoted by workingmen, was languishing for want of patronage and at\r\nonce arranged to visit it unofficially. He went through it carefully,\r\nbuying a number of articles and expressing much interest in the project.\r\nThere was no further neglect of the institution by the general public.\r\nThere was, perhaps, no single work in which he more appreciated the\r\nopportunity of doing good than that connected with the Housing of the\r\nPoor Commission to which he was appointed in 1884. He more than once\r\npresided at its meetings and took an active part in the investigations\r\nwhich were necessary. He attended every sitting and studied quietly and\r\nprivately the whole condition of the poor in the poorest quarters of\r\nLondon and other cities. The Prince never hesitated to criticize those\r\nwho neglected their charitable duties, or to praise those who lived up\r\nto the level of their opportunities, and in connection with an\r\ninstitution which he opened at Deptford, in 1898, his condemnation of\r\nthe wealthy people in that neighbourhood was severe.\r\n\r\nOn March 4th, 1900, the working-class dwellings built in Shoreditch by\r\nthe City Council were opened by the Prince of Wales. They were largely\r\nthe product of the Royal Commission in which he had taken such interest\r\nand whose proposals were the basis of so much progress in this\r\ndirection. His Royal Highness was accompanied on this occasion by the\r\nPrincess and Lord Suffield and was surrounded on the platform by Lord\r\nWelby, the Earl of Rosebery, the Bishops of London and Stepney, the Earl\r\nand Countess Carrington and others. In his speech the Prince was\r\nexpressive and vigorous upon the necessity of better housing for the\r\npoor. \"I am satisfied, not only that the public conscience is awakened\r\non the subject but that the public demands, and will demand, vigorous\r\naction in cleansing the slums which disgrace our civilization and the\r\nerection of good and wholesome dwellings such as those around us, and in\r\nmeeting the difficulties of providing house-room for the\r\nworking-classes, at reasonable rates, by easy and cheap carriage to not\r\ndistant districts where rents are reasonable.\" He concluded an elaborate\r\nspeech upon the question generally by expressing the hope that the\r\nLegislature would deal with and punish those who were responsible for\r\ninsanitary property. Speaking at a banquet of the London County Council\r\non December 3rd of the same year, the Prince again urged attention to\r\nthe improvement of dwellings in various city areas. A part of this\r\ngenerous desire to aid the poor was the Princess of Wales' dinner to\r\nthree hundred thousand persons in London at the Jubilee of 1897.\r\nContributions poured in unceasingly to the project and amongst others\r\nwas the gift of twenty thousand sheep from the pastoralists of New\r\nSouth Wales, Queensland and Victoria. The organization of the dinner was\r\nin the hands of the Lord Mayor of London and it proved a great success.\r\n\r\nThe gifts of a statesman were cultivated by the Prince of Wales upon\r\nevery proper opportunity. His Empire unity ideas and projects were\r\nabundant evidence of this while a not less distinct proof of statecraft\r\nwas the apparent absence of it--the absolute non-partisan position of\r\nthe Heir Apparent. No one was ever able to say that he held political\r\nviews of any particular type. His delicate tact was particularly shown\r\nin his kindness and courtesy to Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone. When the aged\r\nstatesman finally retired from politics the Prince visited him again at\r\nHawarden Castle and was photographed in a family group. He and the\r\nPrincess attended his funeral and showed the greatest respect for his\r\nmemory and services. When the time came, in 1900, for Mrs. Gladstone to\r\nbe laid beside her husband in Westminster Abbey one of the incidents of\r\na sad occasion was the wreath sent in by their Royal Highnesses with the\r\nfollowing inscription:\r\n\r\n    _In Memory of Dear Mrs. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    \"It is but crossing with abated breath\r\n    And with set face, a little strip of sea,\r\n    To find the loved ones waiting on the shore\r\n    More beautiful, more precious than before.\"\r\n\r\nIn preparing a national memorial to the eminent Liberal leader the\r\nPrince of Wales accepted the post of President of the General Committee\r\nwith the Duke of Westminster as Chairman of the Executive. With Mr.\r\nCecil Rhodes, he was long upon terms of intimacy and never concealed his\r\nadmiration for the great Imperialist's career and objects. There can be\r\nno doubt that he knew much of South African affairs and was instrumental\r\nin the Duke of Fife taking a place on the Directorate of the South\r\nAfrican Chartered Company. The only occasion upon which the Prince ever\r\nwithdrew from a prominent Club was his retirement from the Traveller's\r\nbecause they had black-balled Mr. Rhodes. Not the smallest evidence of\r\nstatecraft which the Prince of Wales showed, in a semi-personal way, was\r\nhis warm sympathy with the emancipation of the Jews and his belief in\r\ntheir absorption into the life and interests of England. His presence at\r\nthe marriage of Mr. Leopold de Rothschild caused, long since, a\r\nsensation in Jewish circles but it was only the first of many\r\ncompliments which the Heir Apparent bestowed upon the \"chosen people\" up\r\nto the days when one of them became Prime Minister and a daughter of the\r\nHouse of Rothschild married a future Premier--the Earl of Rosebery. The\r\nlate Baron Hirsch, the present Lord Rothschild. Sir Reuben Sassoon and\r\nSir Moses Montefiore were amongst his personal friends and he made a\r\nthorough study of the position of the Russian Jews--showing them\r\npractical sympathy in various indirect ways. Of course, this partiality\r\nwas open to misconstruction and the rumour of indebtedness to Jewish\r\nfinancial interests was so prevalent at one time that Sir Francis\r\nKnollys had to write a correspondent, who directly asked the question,\r\nan official statement as Private Secretary to the Prince, that the\r\nlatter had no debts worth speaking of and could pay every farthing he\r\nowed at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\nThere is no question, however, that this friendship with a powerful\r\nfinancial class, ruling great interests in every nation, gave the Prince\r\nof Wales a much enhanced influence abroad. In the same way his obvious\r\nliking for American men and women of standing and ability was marked and\r\ndid undoubted service in promoting good feeling between the two\r\ncountries--where it was not grossly and untruthfully misrepresented by\r\nsensational journals. Really distinguished visitors from the United\r\nStates, whether rich or poor, always found a welcome at the hands of His\r\nRoyal Highness and amongst those whom he appears to have especially\r\nliked were James Russell Lowell, Thomas F. Bayard, Whitelaw Reid and\r\nChauncey M. Depew. American women who have been absorbed into English\r\nlife and society like Lady Harcourt, Mrs. Chamberlain and the Duchess of\r\nMarlborough were always treated with marked courtesy by both the\r\nPrincess and himself. His visit to the United States in 1860 had also\r\ntaught him something of conditions there which those around him were not\r\nalways fully aware of. Hence the value of the message which was sent to\r\nthe New York _World_ in the name of the Prince of Wales and the Duke of\r\nYork during the Venezuelan crisis. If it be true that a private letter,\r\na word spoken in season, or a brief drawing-room conversation, is often\r\nmore influential than a cloud of newspaper writing, then the Prince of\r\nWales was for years a potent force in promoting good-will between the\r\nEmpire and the Republic.\r\n\r\nAs a diplomatist there can be no doubt of the Heir Apparent's influence.\r\nHe succeeded, in fact, to much of the power held in that respect by the\r\nPrince Consort. It was the post of an unofficial and secret personal\r\nmediator between the Sovereign of Great Britain and those of other\r\ncountries. Thoroughly acquainted with the personality of foreign rulers,\r\nrelated to the majority of those in Europe, knowing their degrees of\r\nnational influence and personal power, familiar with the statesmen's\r\nposition in Court and Legislature, associated more and more closely as\r\nthe years went on with Queen Victoria's personal view of foreign policy,\r\nthe Prince's position was one of very great indirect power. Through his\r\nheirship to the British throne he was naturally upon terms of something\r\nlike equality with those whom he met as rulers at Berlin or St.\r\nPetersburg, at Paris or Vienna, and more in sympathy with their point of\r\nview than men of less than Royal rank. To quote Mr. George W. Smalley in\r\n_McClure's Magazine_ of March, 1901: \"His is a strange nature. He has,\r\nvery fully and strongly, the pride of Kings and what the pride of Kings\r\nis, a republican who has lived all his life in a republic can hardly\r\nconceive. He has behind him, moreover, the loyalty of an expectant\r\nnation.\" Upon the other hand he knew more about the people and was more\r\nof them than any other hereditary ruler or prospective ruler in the\r\nworld. Hence the strength of his position when conferring with a German\r\nEmperor, or a Russian Czar, or talking quietly with some Foreign\r\nMinister at a time of crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENTS OF DIPLOMATIC INFLUENCE\r\n\r\nThis personal influence of the Heir Apparent was a factor often ignored.\r\n\"Again and again,\" says Mr. Smalley, from the point of view of one who\r\nwatched for years at the source of power in London, \"the Prince has gone\r\nabroad as--in effect, though of course never in name--an Ambassador from\r\nthe Queen to some Sovereign on the Continent. He has laid her views at\r\nsome critical moments before the German Emperor and carried home the\r\nEmperor's response.\" This sort of personal intercourse must, many a\r\ntime, have solved vital and serious issues. When William II. visited\r\nWindsor in 1899 and the Queen, with the aid of the Prince of Wales, Lord\r\nSalisbury and Mr. Chamberlain, evolved the terms upon which the\r\ncountries were to stand in regard to the coming South African war, can\r\nthere be any doubt as to the place in these negotiations which the Heir\r\nApparent held, or as to the advantage which his many earlier visits to\r\nBerlin in the days of Bismarck and the Kaiser's initiatory years of\r\nrule, must have been to him? The result of this intercourse was, in the\r\nend, the turning of a possible national enemy into a friend; the change\r\nof the Emperor who wrote the famous Transvaal cablegram into the ruler\r\nwho took the first train and boat to Windsor and bowed his head at the\r\ndeath-bed of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting incident in this connection may be found in the\r\nfriendship known to have existed between the Prince of Wales and the\r\nCzar of Russia. Nicholas II. bore the same relationship of nephew to him\r\nthat was borne by William II. and, like the other Imperial ruler, came\r\nto bear a similar feeling of respect and regard for his\r\nuncle--sentiments not always felt between relations, royal or otherwise.\r\nIt was on August 31st, 1894, that the Princess of Wales received a\r\ndespatch from her sister, the Czarina, that Alexander III. was nearing\r\nhis end in the far-away Palace of Livadia. As rapidly as train and ship\r\ncould carry them the Royal couple travelled to Russia, but only in time\r\nfor the prolonged and splendid ceremonial of a state funeral. In this\r\ngreat and solemn pageant, lasting a week, and extending from Livadia to\r\nSt. Petersburg, the Czar and the Prince were constantly together, in the\r\nmost intimate relations, at a moment when the former was just\r\nemerging--as yet a young and inexperienced man--into the\r\nresponsibilities of perhaps the most difficult position in the world. It\r\nwas little wonder if the youthful autocrat of ninety millions took\r\ncounsel of his experienced and genial relative, and found in his society\r\ncomfort and knowledge and the basis of a lasting friendship. Let Mr. W.\r\nT. Stead in the _Review of Reviews_, of January, 1895, describe the\r\nsituation:\r\n\r\n     It was fortunate for every one that he stood where he did, as no\r\n     one outside the Royal Castle could have been to the young Czar what\r\n     the Prince was at Livadia, and afterwards. In the long and almost\r\n     terrible pilgrimage to the tomb which followed, when the corpse of\r\n     the dead Czar was carried in solemn state from the shores of the\r\n     Black Sea to the tomb in the Cathedral that stands on the frozen\r\n     Neva, the Prince was always at the right hand of the Czar. Alike in\r\n     public or in private, the uncle and the nephew stood side by side.\r\n     After the first gush of grief had passed, it was impossible but\r\n     that thoughts of the relations between the two Empires should not\r\n     have crossed the minds of both. These two men share between them\r\n     the over lordship of Asia. To the Czar, the north from the Oural\r\n     to the far Sagahlien; to the other, the south from the Straits of\r\n     Babel Mandeb to Hong Kong. No two men on this planet ever\r\n     represented so vast a range of Imperial power as the first mourners\r\n     at the bier of Alexander the Third.\r\n\r\nAt St. Petersburg, the Duke of York joined the mourning group of Royal\r\npersonages, and there, on November 26th, the young Czar was married to\r\nhis cousin, Princess Alix of Hesse, and a still closer tie of\r\nrelationship formed with the Royal House of England. From this time\r\nforward the diplomatic relations of Russia and Great Britain steadily\r\nimproved and there has never been any doubt amongst those in a position\r\nto judge that it was very largely due to the close friendship between\r\nthe Prince of Wales and his Imperial nephew. In France, and especially\r\namongst its leading men, His Royal Highness was for long an influential\r\nfactor in keeping the wheels of international relations moving smoothly.\r\nPersonally popular, his tactful course at critical periods helped\r\ngreatly in maintaining official amity. The root of this wide-spread\r\ninfluence and practical statecraft, in addition to elements already\r\nindicated and covering more directly the personal equation, was well\r\ndescribed by Mr. Smalley in an article already quoted: \"First of all,\r\nthe impression of real force of character. Next, that combined\r\nshrewdness and good sense which together amount to sagacity. Third,\r\ntact. Add to these firmness and courage, and base all of these gifts on\r\nimmense experience of life by one who has touched it on many sides and\r\nyou will have drawn an outline of character which cannot be much\r\naltered. Add to it the Prince's constant solicitude about public matters\r\nand his intelligent estimate of forces--which last is the chief business\r\nof statesmanship. Add to this again the effect upon the hearer of\r\nconversation from a mind full, not indeed of literature, but of life; a\r\nconversation of wide range, of acuteness, of clear statement and strong\r\nopinion, of infinite good humour.\"\r\n\r\nTo these varied lines of useful statesmanship and personal labour in\r\nwhich the Heir Apparent was engaged for so many years, may be added the\r\npersonal influence which he exercised over men of the Empire from time\r\nto time, and his constant inculcation of pride in country and of\r\npatriotic principle. There will then be seen a total record worthy of\r\nhis later place as the hereditary ruler of vast dominions. In the former\r\nconnection one incident may be mentioned as told by a correspondent\r\nduring the Indian tour: \"The Prince's tact is remarkable, and the news\r\nof his friendliness soon spread over India; one officer of great\r\nexperience in Indian affairs declared that in asking the Maharajah\r\nScindia to ride down the lines with him at Delhi, His Royal Highness\r\nperformed an act which was worth a million sterling.\" Upon the latter\r\npoint his speeches during forty years to innumerable military\r\nbodies--Militia, Volunteer, or Naval--may be mentioned. His earliest\r\ndeliverance of this character was in presenting colours to the 100th, or\r\nPrince of Wales' Royal Canadian Regiment, at Thorncliffe, on January\r\n10th, 1859. His first speech as an officer of the Army was, therefore,\r\nof an Imperialistic character: \"The ceremonial, in which we are now\r\nengaged, possesses a peculiar significance and solemnity because in\r\nconfiding to you for the first time this emblem of military fidelity and\r\nvalour, I not only recognize emphatically your enrollment into our\r\nnational force but celebrate an act which proclaims and strengthens the\r\nunity of the various parts of this vast Empire under the sway of our\r\ncommon Sovereign.\" The fact that this address of the youthful Prince--he\r\nwas not eighteen--was probably revised and approved by the Prince\r\nConsort and the Queen, illustrates how early his education in\r\nImperialism began, and how far in advance of public opinion the Queen\r\nand her sagacious husband were.\r\n\r\nThrough the years that followed the Prince of Wales was never backward\r\nin urging efficient military and naval protection for British\r\ninterests. Upon the question of the Navy two speeches, delivered in\r\n1899, may be referred to as indicating the patriotic statesmanship of\r\nthe Heir of the Throne Speaking at the Middlesex Hospital banquet on\r\nApril 12th he said: \"In this country it depends on our Navy and our Army\r\nto uphold the honour and _prestige_ of our nation and to protect the\r\ninterests which have made it the vast empire it is. I rejoice to think\r\nthat Her Majesty's Government have thought fit to increase our Navy. I\r\nrealize by your applause how heartily you reciprocate what I have said,\r\nand I believe that this feeling exists not only in this room but\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of Her Majesty's dominions. In\r\nstrengthening our Navy, God forbid that it should imply in any way that\r\nwe threatened other countries--just the reverse--for, in order to be at\r\npeace, we must be strong. Therefore, the best policy is to strengthen\r\nour first line of defence--the Navy. I hope the motto of which our\r\nVolunteers are so proud may ever be retained by the Navy; that of\r\ndefence, not defiance.\" A little later, as President of the Royal\r\nNational Lifeboat Institution, he presided over a banquet in London on\r\nMay 1st. In proposing the toast of the Army and Navy he declared that\r\nthe country owed them much. \"I am sure the desire of every Englishman is\r\nto see both in a high state of efficiency and that he does not grudge\r\nputting his hand in his pocket to maintain them, because he knows that\r\nif he has a good fleet and a good army he is safe and the honour of the\r\nEmpire is safe.\"\r\n\r\nAn incident occurred on April 4th, 1900, which afforded abundant proof\r\nof the popularity of the Prince of Wales and indicated the importance\r\nhis position had attained in the eyes of the world. He had been\r\ntravelling to Denmark accompanied by the Princess, and his train had\r\narrived at Brussels _en route_ from Calais to Copenhagen. The carriage\r\nwas a special one and was leaving the station at a slow, preliminary\r\nrate when a youth named Sipido jumped on the foot-board of the car and\r\nfired two shots, in rapid succession, point-blank at the traveller who\r\nwas just taking a cup of tea with his wife. He was about to fire a third\r\ntime, but was seized by the stationmaster, arrested and sent to prison.\r\nThe man turned out to be a Belgian, expressed no regret for his\r\nattempted crime, said that he was willing to try again, and stated,\r\nunder cross-examination, that his object was to avenge the thousands of\r\nmen \"whom the Prince had caused to be slaughtered in South Africa.\" He\r\nwas afterwards tried under the laws of Belgium and acquitted. After\r\nsending dispatches to the Queen and the Duchess of York, containing\r\nassurance of safety, the Prince and Princess proceeded on their way to\r\nDenmark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD VII AND HIS QUEEN ALEXANDRA CROWNED\r\n\r\nOn August 9, 1902, amidst all possible pomp and solemnity the Sovereign\r\nof the British Empire and his beloved Consort received the joyful homage\r\nof their subjects]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING EDWARD VII WITH QUEEN ALEXANDRA GOING IN STATE TO\r\nTHE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY PAYS HOMAGE TO HIS SOVEREIGN\r\n\r\nWhen the Primate came to do homage to Edward VII and was about to exhort\r\nthe King to \"stand firm and hold fast\" he was quite overcome, and his\r\nMajesty to prevent his falling, stretched forth his hand to assist him.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOWER OF LONDON]\r\n\r\nThe event created a profound sensation in Great Britain and throughout\r\nEurope and the British Empire. The first feeling was of astonishment\r\nthat one of the most popular members of the world's Royal circle should\r\nbe the object of such an attempt; the second that more care had not been\r\ntaken by those responsible for his safety in travelling; and the third\r\nwas admiration for the perfect coolness and obvious bravery which he\r\nshowed during and after the ordeal. Everywhere tributes of sympathy were\r\ntendered in language of unstinted appreciation of the Heir Apparent's\r\npublic services and character. Speaking at Acton, on the same evening,\r\nLord George Hamilton, M.P., said: \"What could have induced any foreigner\r\nto raise his hand against the Prince of Wales passed his comprehension.\r\nIf there was one individual who had utilized his position and abilities\r\nto promote the welfare of the poorer section of society it was the\r\nPrince of Wales. No kinder, no more philanthropic, no more humane man\r\nexisted on the face of the earth.\" At other meetings which were going\r\non, sympathetic allusions were made to the event, amidst loud cheers, by\r\nLord Strathcona, Sir William Wedderburn, M.P., the Earl of Hopetoun, and\r\nSir Wilfrid Lawson. Telegrams poured in at Windsor and Marlborough\r\nHouse from every point of the compass. Resolutions of congratulation\r\nwere passed in every portion of the Empire during the next few days, and\r\n\"God bless the Prince of Wales\" rang loudly through the United Kingdom\r\nand many a distant country.\r\n\r\nKing Leopold of Belgium was one of the first to express his deep regret\r\nat the occurrence; the Governments of Victoria, South Australia, Western\r\nAustralia, Queensland, New Zealand, Tasmania, Cyprus, Mauritius and\r\nBarbados, the President of France, the Portuguese Parliament, the Town\r\nCouncils of Ballarat and Bendigo in Australia and Durban in South\r\nAfrica, the Agents-General of all the Colonies in London, the Australian\r\nFederal Delegates in London, the Masonic Grand Lodge of New Zealand, the\r\nCorporation of London, the Government of Servia, the High Commissioner\r\nfor South Africa and the Hon. W. P. Schreiner, Premier of Cape Colony,\r\nthe Governor-General of Canada, the Governor of Malta, and some eight\r\nhundred other Governments, public bodies, or prominent persons,\r\ntelegraphed messages of congratulation or formal Resolutions. The\r\nreferences of the British and Colonial press were more than sympathetic.\r\nThe London _Standard_ thought that \"the veneration felt for the Queen as\r\nwell as the general regard for the Prince's personal qualities and his\r\nuniversal popularity might be supposed to give him absolute immunity,\r\neven in these days of frenzied political animosity and unscrupulous\r\njournalistic violence. The Prince is almost as well-known on the\r\nContinent as he is at home, and his invariable courtesy and unaffected\r\nkindness of heart have been appreciated and acknowledged in capitals\r\nwhere his country is not regarded with affection.\" The London _Daily\r\nNews_ pointed out the utter absence of all excuse for such an attempt.\r\n\"The Prince had refrained with admirable tact and discretion from\r\ninterference with public affairs. All sorts of charitable and\r\nphilanthropic concerns have found in his Royal Highness a sympathetic\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\nReturning home, on April 20th, the Prince of Wales was given a pleasant\r\nsurprise at Altona where, as his train stopped on German soil, he found\r\nthe Emperor William and Prince Henry of Prussia waiting with their\r\nsuites to welcome him to Germany and, at the same time, to offer\r\npersonal congratulations upon his escape. This occurrence created wide\r\ncomment in Europe generally, and was taken to mean a desire by the\r\nGerman Emperor to express friendly national as well as friendly personal\r\nfeelings. When His Royal Highness arrived at Dover, the welcome was\r\nimmense in numbers and enthusiastic in character. The same thing\r\noccurred at Charing-Cross Station, London, where he was met by the Duke\r\nof York and the King of Sweden and Norway and wildly cheered by\r\nthousands of people on his way to Marlborough House. As the _Standard_\r\nput it next day: \"No address of congratulation, presented by dignitaries\r\nin scarlet and gold, could have been nearly as eloquent as that sea of\r\nfriendly faces and the ringing cheers of loyal men.\" In response to the\r\ninnumerable congratulations received, as well as to this reception, the\r\nPrince of Wales issued a personal and public note of thanks in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n\"I have been deeply touched by the numerous expressions of sympathy and\r\ngoodwill addressed to me on the occasion of the providential escape of\r\nthe Princess of Wales and myself from the danger we have lately passed\r\nthrough. From every quarter of the globe, from the Queen's subjects\r\nthroughout the world, as well as from the representatives and\r\ninhabitants of foreign countries, have these manifestations of sympathy\r\nproceeded, and on my return to this country I received a welcome so\r\nspontaneous and hearty that I felt I was the recipient of a most\r\ngratifying tribute of genuine good-will. Such proofs of kind and\r\ngenerous feeling are naturally most highly prized by me, and will\r\nforever be cherished in my memory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nAccession to the Throne\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Queen Victoria and the accession of King Edward were the\r\nfirst and perhaps the greatest events in the opening year of the new\r\ncentury. Before the formal announcement on January 18th, 1901, which\r\nstated that the Queen was not in her usual health and that \"the great\r\nstrain upon her powers\" during the past year had told upon Her Majesty's\r\nnervous system, the people in Great Britain, in Canada, in Australia, in\r\nall the Isles of the Sea and on the shores of a vast and scattered\r\nEmpire, had become so accustomed to her presence at the head of the\r\nState and to her personality in their hearts and lives that the\r\npossibility of her death was regarded with a feeling of shocked\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nDuring the days which immediately followed and while the shadow of death\r\nlay over the towers of Windsor, its influence was everywhere perceptible\r\nthroughout the press, the pulpit and amongst the peoples of the\r\nEmpire--in Montreal as in Winnipeg, in busy Melbourne and in\r\ntrouble-tossed Cape Town, in Calcutta and in Singapore. When the Prince\r\nof Wales, on Thursday evening, the 22nd of January, telegraphed the Lord\r\nMayor of London that \"My beloved mother, the Queen, has just passed\r\naway,\" the announcement awakened a feeling of sorrow, of sympathy and of\r\nImperial sentiment such as the world had never seen before in such\r\nwide-spread character and spontaneous expression.\r\n\r\nYet there was no expression of uneasiness as to the future; no question\r\nor doubt as to the new influence and power that must come into existence\r\nwith the change of rulers; no fear that the Prince of Wales, as King\r\nand Emperor, would not be fully equal to the immense responsibilities of\r\nhis new and great position. Perhaps no Prince, or statesman, or even\r\nworld-conqueror, has ever received so marked a compliment; so universal\r\na token of respect and regard as was exhibited in this expression of\r\nconfidence throughout the British Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPIRE'S CONFIDENCE IN THE NEW KING\r\n\r\nPublic bodies of every description in the United Kingdom, Canada,\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, India and other British countries rivalled each\r\nother in their tributes of loyalty to the new Sovereign as well as of\r\nrespect for the great one who had gone. The press of the Empire was\r\npractically a unit in its expression of confidence, while the pulpit,\r\nwhich had during past years, expressed itself occasionally in terms of\r\ncriticism, was now almost unanimous in approval of the experienced,\r\nmoderate and tried character of the King. The death which it was once\r\nthought by feeble-minded, or easily misled individuals, would shake the\r\nEmpire to its foundations was now seen to simply prove the stability of\r\nits Throne, and the firmness of its institutions in the heart of the\r\npeople. The accession of the Prince of Wales actually strengthened that\r\nMonarchy which the life and reign of his mother had brought so near to\r\nthe feelings and affections of her subjects everywhere.\r\n\r\nOn the day following the Queen's death the new Sovereign drove from\r\nMarlborough House to St. James's Palace; accompanied by Lord Suffield\r\nand an escort of the Horse Guards. He had previously arrived in London\r\nfrom Windsor at an early hour accompanied by the Duke of Connaught, the\r\nDuke of York, the Duke of Argyll, Mr. Balfour and others. The streets\r\nwere densely crowded with silent throngs of people; crape and mourning\r\nbeing visible everywhere, and the raised hat the respectful recognition\r\naccorded to His Majesty. Later in the day the people found their voices\r\nand seemed to think that they could cheer again. At St. James's Palace\r\nthe members of the Privy Council had gathered to the number of 150 and\r\nwere representative of the greatest names and loftiest positions in\r\nBritish public life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING ADDRESSES THE PRIVY COUNCIL\r\n\r\nMembers of the Royal family, the members of the Government, prominent\r\nPeers, leading members of the House of Commons, the principal Judges and\r\nthe Lord Mayor of London--by virtue of his office--were in attendance.\r\nLord Salisbury, Lord Rosebery, Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. Balfour; the Dukes\r\nof Norfolk, Devonshire, Portland, Northumberland, Fife and Argyll; the\r\nEarls of Clarendon, Pembroke, Chesterfield, Cork and Orrery and Kintore;\r\nLord Halsbury, Lord Ashbourne, Lord Knutsford, Sir M. E. Hicks-Beach,\r\nLord Balfour of Burleigh, Lord George Hamilton, Mr. St. John Brodrick,\r\nthe Marquess of Lansdowne, Mr. W. H. Long, M.P., Lord Ridley, Sir. H.\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, Sir J. E. Gorst, the Marquess of Ripon, Lord\r\nGoschen, Mr. H. H. Asquith, Lord Pirbright, Lord Selborne, Sir R.\r\nTemple, Mr. W. E. H. Lecky, Sir Drummond Wolff, Sir Charles Dilke, Lord\r\nStalbridge, Sir M. E. Grant-Duff, Mr. John Morley, Earl Spencer and Earl\r\nCarrington were amongst those present. After the Council had been\r\nofficially informed by its President of the Queen's death and of the\r\naccession of the Prince of Wales, the new Sovereign entered, clad in a\r\nField Marshal's uniform, and delivered, without manuscript or notes, a\r\nspeech which was a model of dignity and simplicity. Its terms showed\r\nmost clearly both tact and a profound perception of his position and its\r\nimportance was everywhere recognized:\r\n\r\n     \"Your Royal Highnesses, My Lords and Gentlemen: This is the most\r\n     painful occasion on which I shall ever be called upon to address\r\n     you. My first melancholy duty is to announce to you the death of my\r\n     beloved mother, the Queen, and I know how deeply you and the whole\r\n     nation, and, I think I may say, the whole world, sympathize with me\r\n     in the irreparable loss we have all sustained. I need hardly say\r\n     that my constant endeavour will be always to walk in her footsteps.\r\n     In undertaking the heavy load which now devolves upon me I am fully\r\n     determined to be a constitutional Sovereign in the strictest sense\r\n     of the word, and, so long as there is breath in my body, to work\r\n     for the good and amelioration of my people.\r\n\r\n     I have resolved to be known by the name of Edward, which has been\r\n     borne by six of my ancestors. In doing so I do not undervalue the\r\n     name of Albert, which I inherit from my ever to-be-lamented, great\r\n     and wise father, who by universal consent is I think, and\r\n     deservedly, known by the name of Albert the Good, and I desire that\r\n     his name should stand alone. In conclusion, I trust to Parliament\r\n     and the nation to support me in the arduous duties which now\r\n     devolve upon me by inheritance, and to which I am determined to\r\n     devote my whole strength during the remainder of my life.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the oath of allegiance had been taken by those present, the\r\nproclamation announcing the accession of the new Monarch was signed by\r\nthe Duke of York--now also Duke of Cornwall,--the Duke of Connaught, the\r\nDuke of Cambridge, Prince Christian, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the\r\nLord Chancellor, the Lord Mayor of London, and the other Privy\r\nCouncillors present. The Houses of Parliament met shortly afterwards and\r\nthe members took the oath of allegiance, while all around the Empire the\r\nsame ceremony was being gone through in varied tongues and many forms\r\nand strangely differing surroundings. There was wide-spread interest in\r\nHis Majesty's choice of a name, and the designation of Edward VII. was\r\nalmost universally approved--the exceptions being in certain Scotch\r\ncontentions that the numeral could not properly apply to Scotland as a\r\npart of Great Britain. The name itself reads well in English history.\r\nEdward the Confessor, though not included in the Norman chronology, was\r\na Saxon ruler of high attainments, admirable character and wise laws.\r\nEdward I, was not only a successful soldier and the conqueror of wild\r\nand warlike Wales, but a statesman who did much to establish unity and\r\npeace amongst his people. Edward II. was remarkable chiefly for the\r\nthrashing which the Scots gave him at Bannockburn while Edward III. was\r\nthe hero of Crecy, the winner of half of France, and a brave and able\r\nruler. Edward IV. was a masterful, hard and not over-scrupulous monarch,\r\nand Edward V. was one of the unfortunate boys who were murdered in the\r\nTower of London. Edward VI. was a mild-natured and honest youth who did\r\nnot live long enough to impress himself upon a strenuous period, or upon\r\ninterests with which his character little fitted him to deal. The last\r\nof the name had reigned, therefore, before the Kingdom of England got\r\nout of its national and religious swaddling clothes; before the reign of\r\nHenry VIII. had freed it from connection with Rome, or that of Elizabeth\r\nhad founded the maritime and commercial empire which, in time, was to\r\ncreate the mighty realm over which the new Edward now assumed sway.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENTS SURROUNDING THE ACCESSION\r\n\r\nThe Proclamation of the King in the cities of the United Kingdom and at\r\nthe capitals of countries and provinces and islands all around the globe\r\nwas a more or less stately and ceremonious function, and the\r\nProclamation itself was couched in phraseology almost as old as the\r\nMonarchy. \"We, therefore, do now with consent of tongue and heart,\r\npublish and proclaim that the high and mighty Prince, Albert Edward, is\r\nnow, by the death of our late Sovereign of happy memory, become our only\r\nlawful and rightful Liege Lord, Edward the Seventh.\" At the ceremony in\r\nLondon, Dublin, Liverpool, Derby and other cities, immense crowds\r\nassembled and \"God save the King\" was sung with unusual heartiness.\r\nMeanwhile, following his address to the Privy Council, the King had\r\nreturned to Osborne with the Duke of Cornwall and York, and there he\r\nfound the German Emperor awaiting him. The latter had come post-haste\r\nfrom Berlin and been in time to see the Queen before she passed away. He\r\nhad now decided to stay until after the funeral and thus to tender every\r\nrespect in his power to the memory of his august grandmother. Parliament\r\nhad been called immediately upon the King's Proclamation, and it met\r\nhurriedly and briefly on January 24th to enable the members to take the\r\noath of allegiance while, all around the Empire, similar proceedings\r\nwere taking place in Courts and Legislatures and Government buildings.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Parliament met in brief Session and the Marquess of\r\nSalisbury in the House of Lords and Mr. A. J. Balfour in the Commons\r\nread a Royal message: \"The King is fully assured that the House of Lords\r\nwill share the deep sorrow which has befallen His Majesty and the nation\r\nby the lamented death of His Majesty's mother, the late Queen. Her\r\ndevotion to the welfare of her country and her people and her wise and\r\nbeneficent rule during the sixty-four years of her glorious reign will\r\never be held in affectionate memory by her loyal and devoted subjects\r\nthroughout the dominions of the British Empire.\" In moving an address of\r\nmingled sympathy and congratulation, in reply, Lord Salisbury spoke with\r\nsincere and weighty words as to the qualities and power of the late\r\nQueen, her position as a constitutional ruler and her \"steady and\r\npersistent influence on the action of her Ministers in the course of\r\nlegislation and government.\" Upon the position of the new Sovereign the\r\nspeaker was explicit: \"He has before him the greatest example he could\r\nhave to follow, he has been familiar with our political and social life\r\nfor more than one generation, he enjoys a universal and enormous\r\npopularity, he is beloved in foreign countries and foreign Courts almost\r\nas much as he is at home, and he has profound knowledge of the working\r\nof our institutions and the conduct of our affairs.\"\r\n\r\nThe motion was seconded by Lord Kimberley as Liberal Leader in the\r\nHouse, and spoken to by the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the Commons Mr.\r\nBalfour referred at length to the great reign and character of Queen\r\nVictoria and to the Sovereign's influence upon public affairs. \"In my\r\njudgment the importance of the Crown in our Constitution is not a\r\ndiminishing but an increasing factor.\" Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the\r\nOpposition Leader, seconded the motion, dealt with the late Queen's\r\npersonal character, referred to Queen Alexandra as having long reigned\r\nin the hearts of the people, and paid high tribute to King Edward: \"For\r\nthe greater part of his life it has fallen to him not only to discharge\r\na large part of the ceremonial public duty which would naturally be\r\nperformed by the head of the State; but also to take a leading part in\r\nalmost every scheme established for the national benefit of the country.\r\nReligion and charity, public health, science and literature and art,\r\neducation, commerce, agriculture--not one of these subjects appealed in\r\nvain to His Majesty, when Prince of Wales, for strong sympathy and even\r\nfor personal effort and influence. We know how unselfish he has been in\r\nthe assiduous discharge of all his public duties, we know with what tact\r\nand geniality he has been able to lend himself to the furtherance of\r\nthese great objects.\"\r\n\r\nThe tactful and obviously sincere language of the King's address to his\r\nCouncil had, meanwhile, won the warmest and most loyal commendation in\r\nall parts of the Empire--the unanimity of approval being extraordinary\r\nin view of the diversity of peoples and interests involved. Other\r\nmessages which followed from His Majesty were of the same statesmanlike\r\ncharacter. To the Army, on January 25th, he issued a special message, as\r\nSovereign and as constitutional head, thanking it for the splendid\r\nservices rendered to the late Queen and describing her pride in its\r\ndeeds and in being herself a soldier's daughter. \"To secure your best\r\ninterests will be one of the deepest objects of my heart and I know I\r\ncan count upon that loyal devotion which you ever evinced toward your\r\nlate Sovereign.\" On the following day the Navy received a message of\r\nthanks for the distinguished services rendered by it during the long and\r\nglorious reign of the late Queen and concluding with these words:\r\n\"Watching over your interests and well-being I confidently rely upon\r\nthat unfailing loyalty which is the proud inheritance of your noble\r\nService.\"\r\n\r\nAn incident followed which once more showed the tactfulness of character\r\nso desirable and important in a Sovereign. The presence of William II.\r\nof Germany in England, at this particular period, was creating much\r\ndiscussion abroad and his evident friendship for the King, whom he had\r\njust made an Admiral of the German fleet and with whom he had been\r\nhaving prolonged conferences--in company on one occasion with Lord\r\nLansdowne who had been hastily summoned to Osborne--increased this\r\ninterest. On January 28th the situation was accentuated by the\r\nannouncement that the German Emperor had been made a Field Marshal in\r\nthe British Army and his son, the Crown Prince, a Knight of the Garter.\r\nIn personally conferring the latter honour King Edward made a brief\r\nspeech in which he expressed the hope that the kindly action of the\r\nEmperor in coming to London at this juncture and his own presentation of\r\nthis ancient Order to the Prince might \"further cement and strengthen\r\nthe good feeling which exists between the two countries.\"\r\n\r\nBetween the time of the King's accession and the funeral of Queen\r\nVictoria, on February 1st, the press and public of the Empire were busy\r\ntaking stock of the great loss sustained and measuring the character and\r\npossibilities of the new Sovereign. There was, in both connections, a\r\ncurious and striking unanimity, as may be inferred from what has been\r\nalready stated. A few expressions of authoritative opinion about the new\r\nKing may, however, very properly be quoted here in addition to the\r\nreferences made in Parliament. The London _Times_, on the day following\r\nthe Queen's death, spoke of the long training undergone by the Prince of\r\nWales, of his wide experience and his acquaintance with the ceremonial\r\nfunctions of Royalty. \"Endowed as he is with many of the most lovable\r\nand attractive qualities of his mother--with warm sympathies, with a\r\nkind heart, with a generous disposition, and with a quick appreciation\r\nof genuine worth--the nation is happy in the confidence that, in spirit\r\nas well as in form, it may count upon the maintenance of that conception\r\nof Royalty which is the only one which most of us have ever known. To\r\nthese qualities the King adds perfect tact, wide knowledge of men and\r\nthe business virtues of method, prompt decision, punctuality and great\r\ncapacity for work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKINDLY AND LOYAL WORDS\r\n\r\nSpeaking on January 24th at the City Temple, the Rev. Dr. Joseph Parker,\r\nChairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, spoke of the\r\nKing's great opportunities and personal powers. \"As Prince of Wales he\r\nhas played a difficult part with strict sagacity and unfailing\r\ngood-nature. He is a man of great compass of mind. Let us welcome him\r\nwith our warmest appreciation.\" From across the Atlantic came the voice\r\nof the Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in his eloquent\r\nspeech in Parliament on February 8th: \"We have believed from the first\r\nthat he who was a wise Prince will be a wise King, and that the policy\r\nwhich has made the British Empire so great under his predecessor will\r\nalso be his policy.\" From the still more distant Melbourne, Australia,\r\ncame the kindly and loyal words of the _Argus_ on February 1st: \"In the\r\neyes of his subjects, near and far, he is clothed with the kindliness,\r\nthe tact, the sympathy with social progress, the practical intelligence,\r\nthe political impartiality, and the keen sense of duty he displayed\r\nduring the many years in which he helped his mother in the discharge of\r\nthe Royal tasks. His people know that he possesses the amiability, the\r\ndignity, the clear vision and the industry which befit the occupant of a\r\nmost exacting as well as exalted position.\" From all over the world came\r\ntestimonies of similar feeling, and within British dominions the\r\nopinions and tributes everywhere partook of one quality--that of trust\r\nand confidence in the new Sovereign.\r\n\r\nDuring this first week of his reign the work which devolved upon the\r\nKing was tremendous. The signing and consideration of necessary\r\ndocuments which had been delayed during the illness of the Queen was\r\nalone a serious task. The slight sickness of the Duke of Cornwall and\r\nYork detached him from the help which he might have given in many ways,\r\nand the presence of the German Emperor increased the burden of\r\ndiscussion and of questions to be dealt with. The King also took charge\r\nof the large and complicated arrangements connected with the funeral\r\nceremonies and supervised the immense variety of details with his usual\r\nbusiness-like ability and energy. This great function, which eclipsed\r\nthe Jubilee in solemn splendour and exceeded any demonstration in\r\nhistory in its unquestioned weight of public sorrow, commenced on\r\nFriday, February 1st, when the remains of the Queen were removed from\r\nOsborne to the Royal yacht _Alberta_.\r\n\r\nThe coffin was carried by Highlanders and blue-jackets, followed by the\r\nKing, the German Emperor, the Duke of Connaught, the German Crown\r\nPrince, Prince Henry of Prussia, Prince Christian, the Duke of\r\nSaxe-Coburg and Gotha, Prince Arthur of Connaught, Prince Charles of\r\nDenmark, Prince Louis of Battenberg, and then Queen Alexandra and the\r\nPrincesses. The _Alberta_ passed across the Solent to Portsmouth,\r\nthrough a long and continuous avenue of saluting warships, and was\r\nfollowed by another vessel with the Royal mourners on board. The members\r\nof the Lords and Commons were on vessels placed amongst the warships.\r\nOn Saturday the body of the late Sovereign was brought from Portsmouth\r\nto the metropolis and borne with solemn state to Paddington station\r\nthrough millions of black-garbed, silent and mournful people, and\r\nbetween lines, along the entire route, of thirty-three thousand Regular\r\ntroops and volunteers. It was followed by the King, the German Emperor\r\nand the Duke of Connaught, riding abreast, the Kings of Portugal and\r\nGreece, forty Princes representing every Royal House in Europe,\r\nseventeen representatives of the Colonies, a long array of Ambassadors\r\nand foreign representatives, the Queen, the Princesses, the King of the\r\nBelgians, the Duke of Cambridge, Lord Roberts, Lord Wolseley. The coffin\r\nwas taken by train to Windsor where, in St. George's Chapel, the funeral\r\nservice was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of\r\nWinchester. The actual interment took place on Monday afternoon in the\r\nRoyal Mausoleum of Frogmore, where the remains of the great Queen were\r\nlaid in death beside those of the husband whose memory she had so long\r\ncherished in life.\r\n\r\nThese prolonged obsequies--the most splendid and impressive in\r\nhistory--passed off with a smoothness of procedure which, under the\r\ncircumstances of sorrow and crowding duties, indicated more than\r\nordinary powers of concentration and management in the new King, as well\r\nas a most marvellous sentiment and sympathy amongst the people.\r\nThroughout the Empire, as that solemn procession passed along the\r\npurple-draped streets of London, funeral services were being held and\r\nsermons of sorrow preached in an uncounted multitude of churches\r\ndarkened with all the habiliments of mourning. As the _Standard_ well\r\nput it on February 5th: \"The nation is conscious of its debt to the\r\nKing, whose tactful perception and devoted labour gave it so splendid an\r\nopportunity of showing its reverence for the Sovereign who has just\r\npassed away. The King on his side has found strength and comfort in\r\nthose eloquent demonstrations of the sympathy of his subjects which have\r\nreached him, in innumerable ways, from all parts of his dominions.\"\r\nImmediately after the last ceremonies had been performed the King issued\r\na series of Messages which, for tact and courtesy and kindliness, have\r\nrarely been excelled--even by the experienced eloquence of his Royal\r\nmother. They were all dated February 4th and the first was addressed \"To\r\nmy People.\" It commenced by saying: \"Now that the last scene has closed\r\nin the noble and ever-glorious life of my beloved mother, the Queen, I\r\nam anxious to endeavour to convey to the whole Empire the extent of the\r\ndeep gratitude I feel for the heart-stirring and affectionate tributes\r\nwhich are everywhere borne to her memory.\" His Majesty proceeded to\r\nspeak of the recent magnificent display by sea and land and the\r\ninspiration of courage and hope which the public sympathy had been to\r\nhim during the recent trying days. \"Encouraged by the confidence of that\r\nlove and trust which the nation ever reposed in its late and\r\nfondly-mourned Sovereign, I shall earnestly strive to walk in her\r\nfootsteps, devoting myself to the utmost of my powers to maintaining and\r\npromoting the highest interests of my people and to the diligent and\r\nzealous fulfilment of the great and sacred responsibilities which,\r\nthrough the will of God, I am now called to undertake.\"\r\n\r\nA second Message was addressed \"To my People beyond the Seas.\" After\r\nreferring to the countless dispatches which had been received from his\r\n\"Dominions over the Seas\" and the universal grief felt throughout the\r\nEmpire, the King spoke of the \"heartfelt interest\" always evinced by the\r\nlate Sovereign in the welfare of Greater Britain, in the extension of\r\nself-government, in the loyalty of the people to her Throne and person,\r\nin the gallantry of those who had fought and died for the Empire in\r\nSouth Africa. He concluded as follows: \"I have already declared that it\r\nwill be my constant endeavour to follow the great example which has\r\nbeen bequeathed to me. In these endeavours, I shall have a constant\r\ntrust in the devotion and sympathy of the people and of their several\r\nrepresentative assemblies throughout my vast Colonial dominions. With\r\nsuch loyal support, I will, with God's blessing, solemnly work for the\r\ncommon welfare and security of the great Empire over which I have now\r\nbeen called to reign.\"\r\n\r\nThe next and last of these historic documents was a letter to the\r\nPrinces and peoples of India in which His Majesty informed them that\r\nthrough the lamented death of his mother he had inherited a Throne\r\n\"which has descended to me through a long and ancient lineage\" and then\r\nproceeded: \"I now desire to send my greeting to the ruling Chiefs of the\r\nNative States and to the inhabitants of my Indian dominions, to insure\r\nthem of my sincere good will and affection and of my heartfelt wishes\r\nfor their welfare.\" He spoke of his illustrious predecessor as having\r\nfirst taken upon herself the direct administration of Indian affairs and\r\nassumed the title of Empress in token of her closer association with the\r\ngovernment of that country; referred to the loyalty of its people and\r\nthe services rendered by its Princes in the South African war and by its\r\nnative soldiers in other countries; and concluded in the following\r\nexpressive words: \"It was by her wish and with her sanction that I\r\nvisited India and made myself acquainted with the ruling Chiefs, the\r\npeople and the cities of that ancient and famous Empire. I shall never\r\nforget the deep impressions which I then received and I shall endeavour\r\nto follow the great Queen-Empress, to work for the general well-being of\r\nmy Indian subjects of all ranks and to merit, as she did, their\r\nunfailing loyalty and affection.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing these incidents came the return home of the German Emperor, a\r\nletter of thanks from the King to Earl Roberts for his management of the\r\nmilitary part of the funeral arrangements, and a most enthusiastic\r\nreception to His Majesty and Queen Alexandra during a rapid passage\r\nthrough London to Marlborough House on February 27th. From this time on,\r\nduring weeks of crowded work and the assumption of new responsibilities\r\nand functions, the King received many addresses of mingled condolence\r\nand congratulation. One of the first was from the Royal Agricultural\r\nSociety of England which the King had done so much to aid as Heir\r\nApparent. The President, Earl Cawdor, in speaking to the Council on\r\nFebruary 6th, referred to \"the keen personal interest which the King had\r\never taken in all that related to the welfare of the agricultural\r\ninterests of the country at large, and especially of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society. They had made many and many calls upon his time\r\nand thought.\" Canterbury Convocation referred to the pending visit of\r\nthe Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York to Australia, New Zealand and\r\nCanada. The County of Derby the Royal Society, the Benevolent Society of\r\nSt. Patrick--all sorts of organizations, political, financial,\r\ncommercial, religious, scientific, official, artistic, benevolent and\r\nliterary--expressed their admiration for the late Queen and their\r\nloyalty to the new Sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GROUP AT SANDRINGHAM PALACE\r\n\r\nThe favourite residence of King Edward while he was Prince of Wales.

In response to the\r\naddresses His Majesty made a direct reference to the Housing of the Poor\r\nQuestion, which he described as one in which \"I have always taken the\r\ndeepest personal interest.\" At a meeting of the Mark Master Masons of\r\nEngland on February 19th, with the Earl of Euston in the chair, the\r\nusual address was passed, and then a letter was read from Sir Francis\r\nKnollys, saying that the King felt it necessary to resign the\r\nGrand-Mastership, but that he would remain a Patron of the Order. Five\r\ndays later the King received at St. James's the loyal address of the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, presented by its Chancellor, the Marquess of\r\nSalisbury; of the University of Cambridge, presented by its Chancellor,\r\nthe Duke of Devonshire; of the General Assembly of the Church of\r\nScotland, presented by the Right Rev. Dr. Norman Macleod; of the\r\nCorporation of Edinburgh and the Royal Society. Each of the deputations\r\npresenting these addresses was large and distinguished in membership,\r\nand to each His Majesty addressed a brief and tactful speech.\r\n\r\nOn March 12th another brilliant function was held at the same Palace,\r\nwhen the King received addresses from the Convocation of Canterbury,\r\npresented by the Archbishop, and that of the Northern Convocation\r\npresented by the Archbishop of York; the University of London, the\r\nEnglish Presbyterian Church and the Society of Friends. Eight days later\r\nthe great event in this connection, amidst surroundings of state and\r\nsplendour, was the reception of over forty addresses from cities,\r\nboroughs, institutions and various public bodies. Included in the list\r\nof deputations presenting addresses were those from the Universities of\r\nEdinburgh, Dublin, Victoria and Wales, the Dutch Reformed Church, the\r\nBaptist Union, the Congregational Union of England and Wales, the\r\nNational Council of the Evangelical Free Churches, the Cities of York,\r\nLiverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Belfast, Cardiff, Exeter, Chester and\r\nDoncaster, the Bank of England, the Royal Asiatic Society, the\r\nIncorporated Law Society of the United Kingdom, the Coal Exchange, the\r\nUnited Grand Lodge of Freemasons and the Ancient Order of Foresters.\r\nGeneral replies were given to each address and to only a few separately.\r\nAmongst the latter were the Freemasons, to whom the King said: \"I have\r\nfelt much regret at relinquishing the high and honourable post of Grand\r\nMaster which I have held since 1874, and I shall not cease to retain the\r\nsame interest that I have felt in Freemasonry.\" He also expressed great\r\nsatisfaction at being succeeded by the Duke of Connaught.\r\n\r\nFurther addresses were presented in similar state on May 3d. The Roman\r\nCatholic deputation was headed by Cardinal Vaughan and the Duke of\r\nNorfolk and included Lord Llandaff and fourteen Bishops--a brilliant\r\npicture in red and purple and black. Their address was of peculiar\r\ninterest and contained the following paragraph: \"Your Majesty's life has\r\nbeen spent in the midst of your people, sharing in their happiness and\r\nprosperity, actively engaged in ameliorating the condition of the lowly\r\nand in promoting their comfort in sickness and suffering. All classes of\r\nthe population--the leisured, the professional, the industrial and the\r\npoor--have been the object of your sympathy and interest.\" A deputation\r\nfrom the Jews of Great Britain included Lord Rothschild, the Hon. L. W.\r\nRothschild, M.P., the Chief Rabbi, Sir G. Faudel-Phillips, Sir Edward\r\nSassoon, M.P., Mr. B. L. Cohen, M.P., and Sir J. Sebag-Montefiore.\r\nAddresses were also presented by the Presbyterian Church of England, and\r\non behalf of a large number of cities and towns.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, King Edward had been conferring honours or positions upon\r\nsome of his old friends and faithful servants, re-organizing his\r\nHousehold generally for the still more onerous and important work now\r\nbefore them, and not forgetting to conspicuously reward the best and\r\noldest servants of the late Sovereign. In this delicate task he showed\r\nhis usual tact and consideration. First in this respect, as she had been\r\nfor so many years wherever he could properly place her in the front, was\r\nhis wife--and to Queen Alexandra was given the first honour of the new\r\nreign in her creation, under special statute, on February 12th, as Lady\r\nof the Most Noble Order of the Garter--the greatest order of Knighthood\r\nin the world. Three days later the Royal Victorian Order in its highest\r\nform--G.C.V.O.--was given to the Duke of Argyll and the Duke of Fife.\r\nLord Edward Pelham-Clinton, Major-General Sir John Carstairs McNeill,\r\nV.C., Sir Fleetwood Edwards and Sir Arthur J. Bigge, for many years\r\nimportant members of Queen Victoria's Household, received the same\r\nhonour, as did the King's own devoted Secretary, Sir Francis Knollys.\r\n\r\nOn February 18th, a number of appointments were made to the Household\r\nincluding Lord Suffield as Lord-in-Waiting with General the Right Hon.\r\nSir D. M. Probyn, Sir John McNeill, Lord Wantage, V.C., Sir Fleetwood\r\nEdwards and Sir Arthur Bigge as Extra Equerries to His Majesty. General,\r\nViscount Bridport and General the Duke of Grafton were appointed\r\nHonorary Equerries and Major-Generals Sir Henry P. Ewart and Sir Stanley\r\nClarke to other positions at Court. Queen Alexandra appointed the\r\nmembers of her Household under date of March 8th and they included the\r\nDuchess of Buccleuch and Queensberry as Mistress of the Robes, the\r\nCountesses of Antrim, Macclesfield, Gosford and Lytton and the Lady\r\nSuffield and Dowager Countess of Morton as Ladies of the Bedchamber,\r\nLord Colville of Culross as Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of Gosford as\r\nVice-Chamberlain, the Earl de Grey as Treasurer, and the Hon. S. R.\r\nGreville as Private Secretary. Numerous appointments of an honorary kind\r\nin connection with the Army and Navy followed and on July 24th the Earl\r\nof Pembroke was announced as Lord Steward of His Majesty's Household,\r\nthe Hon. V. C. W. Cavendish M.P. as Treasurer, Viscount Valentia M.P. as\r\nComptroller, Lord Farquhar as Master of the Household, the Earl of\r\nClarendon as Lord Chamberlain, Major-General Sir Arthur Ellis as\r\nComptroller of Accounts, the Duke of Portland as Master of the Horse,\r\nthe Duke of Argyll as Governor of Windsor Castle and the following as\r\nLords-in-Waiting: the Earl of Denbigh, the Earl of Kintore, Earl Howe,\r\nLord Suffield, Lord Kenyon, Lord Churchill and Lord Lawrence.\r\n\r\nMany of these names may be recognized as amongst the friends or\r\nofficials of the King, in his later years as the Heir Apparent, or as\r\ncompanions in some of his travels. On March 24th, following the custom\r\nof British Sovereigns, several special Embassies were appointed and\r\nannounced to carry to European Courts the official intimation of His\r\nMajesty's accession. That to Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Russia, Germany\r\nand Saxony, included the Duke of Abercorn, the Earl of Kintore,\r\nMajor-General Sir Archibald Hunter and the Marquess of Hamilton, M.P.\r\nand that to Belgium, Bavaria, Italy, Wurtemberg and the Netherlands,\r\nincluded the Earl of Mount Edgecombe, Viscount Downe and Admiral Sir\r\nMichael Culme-Seymour. Earl Carrington, the Earl of Harewood and others\r\nwere appointed to France, Spain and Portugal and Field Marshal Lord\r\nWolseley, Viscount Castlereagh and others to Austro-Hungary, Roumania,\r\nServia and Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nThe First Year of the New Reign\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first year's reign of a Sovereign must always be important, and when\r\nthat Sovereign rules over a third of the earth's surface and a quarter\r\nof its population, it is more than usually so. King Edward VII., when he\r\ncame to the Throne, found himself the first of Mohammedan rulers, with\r\nmore Moslem subjects than the Sultan of Turkey; the first of Brahmin and\r\nParsee Sovereigns; the head of various Confucian colonies and the\r\npossessor of the most sacred of Buddhist shrines; the ruler of Christian\r\nsects and idolatries of every conceivable kind and variety. Almost every\r\nrace in the world was included in his Empire--English, Scotch and Irish\r\neverywhere, French in the Channel Islands and in Canada, Italians and\r\nGreeks in Malta, Arab, Coptic and Turkish subjects in Egypt, Negroes of\r\nall descriptions in the Soudan and elsewhere, subjects of infinitely\r\nvaried Asiatic types in India, Chinese in Hong-Kong and Wei-Hai-Wei,\r\nMalays in Borneo and the Malay Peninsula, Polynesians in the Pacific,\r\nRed Indians in Canada and Maoris in New Zealand, Dutch, Zulus, Basutos\r\nand French Huguenots in South Africa, Eskimos in Northern Canada. The\r\ncomplicated issues involved in such a Government as that of the British\r\nEmpire, with its curiously non-centralized system, were certainly\r\nsufficient to make a Sovereign inheriting the position, the\r\nopportunities, and much of the capacity of Queen Victoria, feel that he\r\nhad, indeed, assumed heavy responsibilities.\r\n\r\nHis first step had been a most wise one, and in direct line with a\r\npolicy carried out as Heir Apparent--the cementing of close and cordial\r\nrelations with the German Emperor during his long and much-discussed\r\nvisit to the dying Queen and mourning family. To this friendship and the\r\nenthusiastic and popular reception given William II. when leaving London\r\non February 5th, 1901, was undoubtedly due the restraining influence\r\nheld over a part of the press of Germany during the succeeding period of\r\nvile abuse of England regarding the South African War. Following this,\r\non February 24th, was the departure of King Edward on a visit to his\r\nsister, the Empress Frederick, at Frederichshof, near Cronberg, where he\r\nwas joined by the Emperor William. The King was accompanied by Sir Frank\r\nLascelles, Ambassador at Berlin, and by his physician, Sir Francis\r\nLaking. The Empress was found to be very ill, but not dying, and after a\r\nfew days her Royal brother and son returned to their respective\r\ncapitals.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING'S FIRST PARLIAMENT AND DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe first Parliament of the new reign was opened by the King in\r\nbrilliant state and with much dignified ceremonial on February 14th. The\r\npageantry of the occasion was picturesque and splendid. The staircase in\r\nParliament House, up which the Royal pair passed in their progress, was\r\nlined with a living hedge of men in blue and silver uniforms, topped\r\nwith red plumes and shining with the burnished steel accoutrements of\r\nthe Horse Guards. Before them were stately, robed officials, such as\r\nLord Salisbury and the Duke of Devonshire and some of the brilliant\r\ncolours of the Court. The King wore a short ermine cape over his Field\r\nMarshal's uniform, and beneath the cape a sweeping cloak and train of\r\nRoyal purple. Queen Alexandra, beautiful always, was more than usually\r\nsweet and dignified in her garb of mingled black and purple. In the\r\nHouse of Lords the evidences of mourning for the late Queen were very\r\napparent. The ladies were dressed in black though they were permitted to\r\nblaze with jewels. The Peers' robes of red and ermine, gave a little\r\ncolour to the scene, helped by those of the judges in black and gold, or\r\nred and white, and the bright uniforms of the Ambassadors in a distant\r\ncorner. Hand-in-hand the King and Queen entered the Chamber and took\r\ntheir places upon the chairs of state. The Commons were called in, and\r\ntheir the Lord Chancellor presented and the King repeated and signed the\r\nsomewhat famous Declaration against the Mass and other Roman doctrines,\r\nor observances, as provided by the Bill of Rights. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"I do solemnly and sincerely in the presence of God, profess,\r\n     testify and declare that I do believe that in the sacrament of the\r\n     Lord's Supper there is not any transubstantiation of the elements\r\n     of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ at or after the\r\n     consecration thereof by any person whatsoever; and that the\r\n     invocation or adoration of the Virgin Mary or any other saint and\r\n     the sacrifice of the mass as they are now used in the Church of\r\n     Rome are superstitious and idolatrous, and I do solemnly in the\r\n     presence of God, profess, testify and declare that I do make this\r\n     Declaration and every part thereof in the plain and ordinary sense\r\n     of the words read unto me as they are commonly understood by\r\n     English Protestants, without any evasion, equivocation, or mental\r\n     reservation whatsoever and without any dispensation already granted\r\n     me for this purpose by the Pope or any other authority or person\r\n     whatsoever, or without any hope of any such dispensation from any\r\n     person or authority whatsoever, or without thinking that I am or\r\n     can be acquitted before God or man, or absolved of this Declaration\r\n     or any part thereof, although the Pope or any other person or\r\n     persons or power whatsoever should dispense with or annull the\r\n     same, or declare that it was null and void from the beginning.\"\r\n\r\nThe next proceeding was the reading of the King's speech to his\r\nParliament in strong, full tones which impressively and clearly filled\r\nthe Chamber. This part of the ceremony was rendered unusually\r\ninteresting, in view of the fact that the King was understood to have\r\nhad more to do with the wording of his speech than had been customary,\r\nand to have changed the conditions by which it had become usual to give\r\nan advance summary of its contents to the press. Reference was made to\r\nthe death of the Queen and to his own accession, to the progress of the\r\nSouth African War, the Chinese troubles, the establishment of the\r\nAustralian Commonwealth, the sending of additional Contingents from the\r\nColonies to the front, the famine in India, the relief of the Coomassie\r\ngarrison, and to his intention to carry out the late Sovereign's wish\r\nregarding the Imperial tour of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and\r\nYork. The whole function was of a solemn and impressive and splendid\r\ncharacter, in keeping with the traditions of the Crown and in harmony\r\nwith the known intentions of the King to assume the full ceremonial and\r\ndignity of his position. The _Times_, on the following morning, referred\r\nto the enthusiastic reception of the King and Queen as they drove to\r\nWestminster and to the inspiring and exhilarating character of the scene\r\nin the House of Lords. \"The present generation has seen hardly anything,\r\nnot even excepting the processions of 1887 and 1897, at all comparable\r\nin splendour and solemnity with the pageant yesterday at Westminster.\"\r\n\r\nThe session of Parliament which followed was closely and continuously\r\nassociated with subjects arising out of the King's accession. An early\r\nand prominent topic was the Declaration taken against Roman Catholicism.\r\nUnder date of February 20th, Cardinal Vaughan issued a letter to his\r\nDiocese declaring that \"patriotism and loyalty to the Sovereign are\r\ncharacteristic of the Catholics of this country and are to be counted\r\non, quite independently of passing emotions of pain or pleasure, because\r\nthey are rooted in a permanent dictate and principle of religion;\" that\r\nCatholics had, however, been made unhappy by the \"recent renewal of the\r\nnational act of apostacy\" in the Sovereign's branding by solemn\r\nDeclaration their religious doctrines as superstitious and idolatrous;\r\nthat the Catholic Peers had done well in protesting to the Lord\r\nChancellor against the continued use of this Declaration; that British\r\nlegislators in all parts of the Empire and the twelve million Catholic\r\nsubjects of the Crown throughout the world should take further measures\r\nof constitutional protest; that the evil so greatly deplored was the\r\nresult of an anachronism and of a barbaric law which had remained\r\naccidentally unrepealed; and that there was reason to hope that \"this\r\nremnant of a hateful fanaticism\" would soon be removed from the\r\nstatute-book.\r\n\r\nIn Canada and Australia protests were prepared and presented through the\r\nCardinal--that from the Dominion being signed by all the members of the\r\nHierarchy. In the House of Lords a Committee was appointed, on motion of\r\nLord Salisbury, to deal with the matter although no Catholic Peers would\r\nserve upon it. They reported early in July that a modification of the\r\nDeclaration might be made so as to omit the adjectives and objectionable\r\nphraseology without affecting the strength of the pledge itself. A\r\nGovernment measure was prepared along these lines and submitted to the\r\nHouse. It was opposed by Lord Rosebery on August 1st, on the ground that\r\nnothing could really bind conscientious convictions, that the King might\r\nchange his views and not be bound by this Declaration in future, and,\r\nthat it did not repudiate the temporal or spiritual supremacy of the\r\nPope. The Archbishop of Canterbury did not like the changes, the Duke of\r\nNorfolk did not care for the new form and the Roman Catholics generally,\r\nin and out of the House, objected to the compromise as useless. The\r\nresult was that Lord Salisbury eventually withdrew his measure and the\r\nmatter dropped out of public discussion for the time--although the\r\nCanadian House of Commons and other public bodies in the Empire had\r\nmeanwhile protested against the continued maintenance of the\r\nDeclaration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING'S INCOME AND REVENUES\r\n\r\nAnother duty which faced the early consideration of Parliament was the\r\nCivil List. Queen Victoria's Civil List had been £385,000, given as a\r\npermanent yearly income for her reign, and in return for the formal\r\nsurrender of the revenues of the Crown Lands for the same period. In\r\nthis connection, the _Daily News_ of February 14th, pointed out that the\r\nlate Sovereign had received during her long reign £24,000,000 from the\r\npeople while the revenues of the surrendered Crown Lands had totalled\r\n£20,000,000. Speaking for the Liberals and Radicals this paper declared\r\nthat there was \"no disposition to deal grudgingly with a Monarch who has\r\nfully borne the share that belongs to him in the country's affairs,\"\r\nthat it might be well to adhere closely to the late Queen's Civil List,\r\nand that the example of \"a moderate and sober Court\" would be of the\r\nhighest value to the nation. On March 11th Sir M. E. Hicks-Beach moved\r\nthe appointment of a House of Commons' Committee to deal with the\r\nquestion, composed of Mr. Balfour, Sir W. Hart Dyke, Sir F.\r\nDixon-Hartland, Sir S. Hoare, Mr. W. L. Jackson, with seven other\r\nmembers and himself, as representatives of the Government party and Sir\r\nHenry Campbell-Bannerman, Sir William Harcourt, Sir Henry Fowler, Sir\r\nJames Kitson, Mr. H. Labouchere, and three others, as representing the\r\nOpposition. The _Times_ of the following day said that there were two\r\nreasons for somewhat increasing the sum to be voted--the fact of the\r\nKing having a Consort of whom the nation was proud, while Queen Victoria\r\nwas unmarried at the time of the former vote, and the fact, as the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer put it to the House, that the King was now\r\nthe head of a world-wide Empire.\r\n\r\nAs finally decided in the Report of the Select Committee the new Civil\r\nList was placed at £470,000 for the Sovereign--of which £110,000 was to\r\ngo to the Privy Purse in place of £60,000 received by Queen Victoria;\r\nthe Duke of Cornwall and York was to receive £20,000 annually, and the\r\nDuchess £10,000--in addition, of course, to the £60,000 coming to the\r\nHeir Apparent from the Duchy of Lancaster; the King's children, the\r\nDuchess of Fife, Princess Victoria and Princess Charles of Denmark, were\r\neach to have £6,000 a year for life; while the contingent annuity of\r\n£30,000 provided in the event of Queen Alexandra surviving her husband,\r\nwas to be increased to £70,000 and a similar contingent grant of £30,000\r\narranged for the Duchess of Cornwall and York. The only apparent\r\nopposition in the Committee to these proposals was from Mr. Labouchere,\r\nwho suggested certain variations and reductions. There was little\r\ninfluential criticism of the changes proposed--the _Daily News_, from\r\nwhich opposition might, perhaps have come, speaking of one special\r\nincrease of £50,000, as follows: \"The Queen must have a separate\r\nHousehold if the Monarchy is to be maintained, as most people wish that\r\nit should be maintained, in its ancient splendour; and the gracious\r\nkindness of Queen Alexandra, who has endeared herself to all the\r\nsubjects of her husband, will make the tax-payer in her case a cheerful\r\ngiver.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 9th Resolutions based upon these recommendations were presented\r\nto the Commons by Sir M. E. Hicks-Beach and eventually carried by three\r\nhundred and seven to fifty-eight--the latter being composed of Irish\r\nmembers and Mr. Labouchere. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his\r\nintroductory speech, referred to the Monarchy as \"the most popular of\r\nall our great institutions\" and then proceeded to enlarge upon the\r\nsituation as follows: \"Throughout the Empire there has grown up a\r\nfeeling, and I think a very right and proper feeling, of the enormous\r\nimportance of the Crown as the main link of the relations with all the\r\npeople of which the Empire is composed. Therefore, I think it happened\r\nthat, in the brief debate in which this subject was dealt with at the\r\ncommencement of the present Session, there was no sign of any difference\r\nof opinion as to the necessity of making a sufficient and adequate\r\nprovision for the maintenance of the honour and dignity of the Crown.\"\r\nHe mentioned the fact that the late Sovereign had bequeathed Balmoral\r\nand Osborne House to her successor and that he had to maintain these\r\nresidences as well as his old-time home at Sandringham; that King Edward\r\nhad no personal fortune and that the late Queen's savings had been\r\nwilled to her younger children. He concluded by expressing approval of\r\nthe proposals as moderate and fair. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, on\r\nbehalf of the Opposition, declared them to be reasonable and added: \"I\r\ndo not doubt at all that the prevailing desire in this House and in the\r\ncountry is to see that a provision should be made for maintaining that\r\nstate and dignity of the British Crown which shall fittingly represent\r\nthe loyal attachment of the people.\" Mr. J. E. Redmond followed and\r\ndeclared that not only had the Irish members refused to act upon the\r\nCommittee but they would now vote against the Resolutions because of the\r\nunrepealed statute and Declaration regarding Roman Catholicism. Mr.\r\nLabouchere spoke against them at length and was joined in speech and\r\nvote by two Labour members--Messrs. Keir Hardie and Cremer--who, amidst\r\nlaughter and interruptions, declared themselves to be republicans and\r\nexpressed regret that the working classes liked Royalty.\r\n\r\nThe next subject discussed in Parliament, as it was also being discussed\r\nthroughout British countries generally, was that of the Royal titles. As\r\nthey stood when the King ascended the throne the only countries of the\r\nEmpire recognized were Great Britain, Ireland and India. It was pointed\r\nout that Queen Mary in the days of Spanish marriage relations and power\r\npossessed, with King Philip, titles which included England, France,\r\nNaples, Jerusalem, Ireland, Spain, Sicily, Austria, Milan &c; that\r\nEmperor Francis Joseph was not only Emperor of Austria but King of\r\nHungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Sclavonia, Gallicia, Illyria and\r\nJerusalem; that the three principal countries of the Empire were now\r\nstrong enough and prominent enough to be properly and permanently\r\nrepresented in this way; that it would enhance the dignity of Great\r\nBritain while placing Canada and Australia in a more equal and national\r\nposition within the Empire; that some such recognition had been\r\nsupported in 1876 by Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Disraeli in the House of\r\nCommons; and that it had been proposed by the Colonial Conference of\r\n1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITION TO THE KING'S TITLES\r\n\r\nWithin a short time of the King's accession--on January 29th--a dispatch\r\nwas sent by Mr. Chamberlain to the Governors-General of Canada and\r\nAustralia saying that the moment was opportune to consider the matter of\r\nthe Monarch's titles, so as to recognize the \"separate and greatly\r\nincreased importance of the Colonies\" and suggesting, personally, the\r\nphrase: \"King of Great Britain and Ireland and of Greater Britain beyond\r\nthe Seas.\" Mr. Chamberlain also expressed the belief that there were\r\nconsiderable difficulties in the way of such designations as King of\r\nCanada and King of Australia, owing to the smaller Colonies which would\r\ndesire to be also specially mentioned. Lord Minto, in his reply,\r\nexpressed his Government's doubt as to the use of the word \"Greater\r\nBritain,\" their preference for the title \"King of Canada\" and their\r\nwillingness, in case of jealousies elsewhere, to propose that of\r\n\"Sovereign of all British Dominions beyond the Seas.\" Lord Hopetoun\r\nstated that his Government preferred the designation of \"Sovereign Lord\r\nof the British Realms beyond the Seas.\" The Colonial Secretary then\r\ncommunicated with Cape Colony, Newfoundland and New Zealand where the\r\nGovernments all favoured some general designation.\r\n\r\nOn July 27th, Lord Salisbury introduced a measure in the House of Lords\r\nauthorizing the Sovereign \"to make such addition to the style and title\r\nat present appertaining to the Imperial Crown of the United Kingdom and\r\nits Dependencies as to His Majesty may seem fit.\" Speaking unofficially,\r\nthe Premier intimated that the Royal title would probably be \"Edward\r\nVII., by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, and of all the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King,\r\nDefender of the Faith, Emperor of India.\" During a short discussion in\r\nthe House, two days later, Lord Rosebery suggested the title of \"King of\r\nall the Britains\" Lord Salisbury did not consider this admissible,\r\nhowever, and the measure passed its second reason without opposition.\r\nEventually the bill became law and was the subject of general approval\r\nat home and in the Colonies. The title was then officially proclaimed in\r\nthe terms mentioned by Lord Salisbury. Speaking of this action, Sir\r\nHorace Tozer of Queensland told the _Daily News_ of July 31st that the\r\nCommonwealth Act declared the desire of the Australian people, in its\r\nfirst words, to unite in one indissoluble Commonwealth \"under the Crown\"\r\nand he expressed the opinion that this action would \"ratify and give\r\nexpression\" to that deliberate decision.\r\n\r\nOn May 10th, a Dublin newspaper called _The Irish People_ published an\r\narticle about the King which was not only seditious in language but\r\nabominable in its allegations and statements--they could hardly be\r\ndignified with the name of charges. The paper was at once seized, and on\r\nthe following day the Irish members precipitated a debate in Parliament\r\nupon the action thus taken. Mr. John Dillon pointed out that this paper\r\nwas the recognized organ of the Nationalist movement, claimed that the\r\naction of the Government was grossly illegal, and declared that it was\r\na blow struck at the freedom of the press. Mr. W. Redmond took much the\r\nsame ground. Mr. George Wyndham, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, spoke\r\nof the article as containing \"outrageous, scurrilous, gross and coarse\r\nremarks,\" and as using language more foul than that of certain foreign\r\npapers which had been so complained of during the year. He had ordered\r\nit to be seized because it was guilty of \"seditious libel,\" because it\r\nwas his duty to prevent such a nuisance from being inflicted upon the\r\npublic, and because similar action had been taken in the past year upon\r\nan article attacking the late Queen Victoria. Mr. John Redmond declared\r\nthat the action was taken too late, anyway, and that plenty of copies\r\nhad gone through the mail to America and the Continent. Mr. Balfour\r\nsupported Mr. Wyndham and asked, if \"obscene libel\" and \"a foul and\r\npoisoned weapon\" were necessary aids to Irish agitation. He pointed out\r\nthat the Sovereign was incapable of replying to this sort of statement,\r\nand declared that the publication was \"a gross offense against public\r\ndecency and public law and loyalty.\" Mr. H. H. Asquith, on behalf of the\r\nOpposition, took the ground that those concerned could appeal to the\r\nCourts, if injured, and that he could not but accept the Government's\r\ndescription of the article and support them in their action. Messrs.\r\nBryn-Roberts, Labouchere and John Burns criticised the Government, and\r\nthe vote stood two hundred and fifty-two to sixty-four in approval of\r\ntheir action.\r\n\r\nThe debate in the Imperial Parliament was, however, not the end of the\r\nmatter. A newspaper in Melbourne, Australia, called _The Tocsin_,\r\nrepublished the article in question, and its proprietor, Mr. E. Findley,\r\nM.L.A., was at once expelled from the Victorian Legislature. The\r\ndiscussion and vote took place on June 25th, when Mr. Findley disclaimed\r\nresponsibility as being publisher and not Editor, but defended the\r\nnewspaper's statement that suppression of the Dublin paper was an\r\nillegal act. He expressed regret, however, that the article had appeared\r\nin his journal, in view of its having given offence to the House. The\r\nPremier of Victoria, Mr. A. J. Peacock, at once declared that no apology\r\nwas sufficient unless it included unqualified disavowal and disapproval\r\nof the article in question, and moved the following Resolution: \"That\r\nthe Honourable member for Melbourne, Mr. Edward Findley, being the\r\nprinter and publisher of a newspaper known as _The Tocsin_, in the issue\r\nof which, on the 20th instant, there is published a seditious libel\r\nregarding His Majesty the King, is guilty of disloyalty to His Majesty\r\nand has committed an act discreditable to the honour of Parliament, and\r\nthat he, therefore, be expelled from this House.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Irvine, Leader of the Opposition, endorsed the action of the\r\nGovernment, and declared that the republication--even to the appearance\r\nof a second edition of the paper--was a deliberate attempt to give\r\ncurrency to this \"foul and scandalous libel\" as being a fact. Many\r\nothers spoke, and Mr. Findley in another speech said he had no sympathy\r\nwhatever with the article, and was extremely sorry that it had appeared.\r\nOrders had come from outside for thousands of copies of the paper and\r\nhad not been filled. The House, however, was determined to take action,\r\nand he was expelled by a vote of sixty-four to seventeen. Mr. Findley\r\nran again as a Labour candidate in East Melbourne and was opposed by Mr.\r\nJ. F. Deegan--a man of no particular politics, but known for his\r\nloyalty, and supported on the platform by both party Leaders. The latter\r\ncandidate was elected by a substantial majority. A very few other\r\nAustralian papers had, meanwhile, republished the article, and perhaps\r\nhalf a dozen Canadian ones.\r\n\r\nThe first Parliament of the reign closed on August 17th shortly after\r\nthe King had suffered the loss of his distinguished sister, the Empress\r\nFrederick. With this event, which occurred on August 8th, there passed\r\naway what the _Times_ well termed \"a life of brilliant promise, of\r\nsplendid hopes, of exalted ideals\"--overruled with relentless rigour by\r\na hard fate which brought her liberal principles into conflict with the\r\niron will of Bismarck, nullified her capacity by the opposition of the\r\nCourt of Berlin, and removed her husband by death at the very moment\r\nwhen the opportunity of power and position seemed to have come. The\r\nKing, accompanied by Queen Alexandra and Princess Victoria, at once left\r\nfor Frederickshof. They were received at Homburg by the Emperor William\r\nand conducted to the Castle. The funeral took place amid scenes of\r\nstately solemnity on August 13th and the Emperor and the King were\r\npresent as chief mourners. While the obsequies were proceeding memorial\r\nservices were held in England at the Chapel Royal, St. James's, in St.\r\nGiles's Cathedral, Edinburgh and in various other churches throughout\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC INCIDENTS AND FUNCTIONS\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, various incidents illustrative of the King's tact and\r\ninfluence upon public affairs had occurred. His well-known interest in\r\nAmerican affairs was shown on June 1st by an official reception given at\r\nWindsor Castle to the members of the New York Chamber of Commerce who\r\nwere visiting England as guests of the London Chamber of Commerce.\r\nAccompanied by Lord Brassey and the Earl of Kintore, some twenty-five\r\ngentlemen were presented to His Majesty and Queen Alexandra. They\r\nincluded General Horace Porter, Mr. Morris K. Jessup, the Hon. Levi P.\r\nMorton, the Hon. Cornelius N. Bliss and Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan. Some of\r\nthe American expressions of opinion upon this not unusual courtesy to\r\ndistinguished foreigners were extremely amusing. Others, such as that of\r\nthe N. Y. _Tribune_ were dignified and appreciative. Immediately upon\r\nhearing of the attempt on President McKinley's life on September 6th,\r\nthe King sent a despatch of deepest sympathy and instructed the Foreign\r\nOffice to keep him informed as to the President's condition. He was at\r\nthe time spending a week with the King of Denmark at Copenhagen and to\r\nthat place the bulletins were duly cabled from Washington.\r\n\r\nOn September 11th His Majesty telegraphed to the American Ambassador at\r\nLondon: \"I rejoice to hear the favourable accounts of the President's\r\nhealth. God grant that his life may be spared.\" After Mr. McKinley's\r\ndeath, three days later, the King immediately cabled the Ambassador:\r\n\"Most truly do I sympathize with you and the whole American nation in\r\nthe loss of your distinguished and ever-to-be-regretted President.\" In\r\nhis reply Mr. Choate declared that \"Your Majesty's constant solicitude\r\nand interest in these trying days have deeply touched the hearts of my\r\ncountrymen.\" The King ordered a week's mourning at Court and soon\r\nafterwards received a message from Mr. Choate voicing Mrs. McKinley's\r\npersonal gratitude for the sympathy expressed. In replying, the King\r\ndeclared that the Queen and himself \"feel most deeply for her in the\r\nhour of her great affliction and pray that God may give her strength to\r\nbear her heavy cross.\" On September 27th the American Ambassador was\r\ngranted a special audience by His Majesty in London and presented the\r\nformal thanks of Mrs. McKinley and of the people of the United States\r\nfor \"the constant sympathy which you have manifested through the darkest\r\nhours of their distress and bereavement.\"\r\n\r\nDuring these months the King had not forgotten to show his continued\r\nappreciation of many of the interests to which, as Heir Apparent, he had\r\ngiven so much aid. At a General Council meeting of the Prince of Wales'\r\nHospital Fund on May 11th, presided over by the Duke of Fife and\r\nattended by Lord Rothschild, Lord Farquhar, Lord Iveagh, Lord Reay, Mr.\r\nSydney Buxton and others the chairman stated that it was held by His\r\nMajesty's wish in order to announce his resignation of the Presidency\r\nand consent to take the position of Patron. The King's place was to be\r\ntaken by the Duke of Cornwall and York. Lord Rothschild spoke at some\r\nlength upon the importance of the work initiated in this connection by\r\nthe King and of the valuable aid which they had consequently been able\r\nto give the hospitals and suffering poor of London. On June 10th a\r\nletter was made public, written by Sir Dighton Probyn on behalf of the\r\nKing, expressing to the Royal Agricultural Society of England his\r\nearnest hope that it would succeed in raising the £30,000 which was\r\nneeded for building purposes, subscribing two hundred and fifty guineas\r\ntoward this end, and expressing not only His Majesty's interest in its\r\nfuture welfare but his pleasure at having been associated with it during\r\ntwenty two years of progress. On July 3rd the King and Queen Alexandra,\r\naccompanied by Princess Victoria and the Duchess of Argyll, received at\r\nMarlborough House some eight hundred nurses belonging to the Training\r\nInstitute inaugurated by the late Queen. Badges were presented by Her\r\nMajesty to a couple of hundred and an address read and graciously\r\nanswered. An incident typical of the King's courtesy and thoughtfulness\r\nwas seen in his intimation to the Marquess of Dufferin, who, during the\r\nearly part of the proceedings was standing bare-headed in the sun, to\r\nput on his hat--the King resuming his in order to create the\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty took great interest during the year in the proposed National\r\nMemorial to his Royal mother. He had early appointed a special Committee\r\nof representatives to deal with the preliminaries and, on March 6th, a\r\nReport was submitted by Lord Esher, as Hon. Secretary, recommending that\r\na statue of Queen Victoria should be the central feature of such a\r\nMemorial, and the location be either the vicinity of Westminster Abbey\r\nor that of Buckingham Palace. Accompanied by Mr. Balfour, Mr.\r\nAkers-Douglas and Lord Esher, the King visited the suggested sites that\r\nafternoon and finally approved a general position near Westminster\r\nAbbey. Large amounts were subscribed toward the project during the\r\nsucceeding months. An interesting incident occurred on July 28th when a\r\nsmall deputation of ladies, including the Countess of Aberdeen, Lady\r\nTaylor and others connected with the National Council of Women in\r\nCanada, were received at Marlborough House by Queen Alexandra and\r\ntendered an address signed by twenty-five thousand women of the Dominion\r\nexpressive of their earnest loyalty to the King and affection for his\r\nConsort. In replying, Her Majesty referred with special pleasure to the\r\ntribute paid the late Queen and spoke of the beauty of the volumes in\r\nwhich the address was incorporated.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL CHARITIES AND VISITS\r\n\r\nToward the end of the year it was announced in the _British Medical\r\nJournal_ that a gentleman who did not at present wish his name\r\ndisclosed--afterwards understood to be Sir Ernest Cassel--had presented\r\nthe King with a donation of £200,000 for some philanthropic purpose to\r\nbe selected, and that His Majesty had decided to devote the money to the\r\nerection of a Sanatorium in England for Consumptive patients. On January\r\n22nd, 1902, the first Anniversary of Queen Victoria's death, the _Times_\r\npaid the following well-deserved tribute to the new Sovereign: \"During\r\nthe year that has gone by he has sedulously and successfully set himself\r\nto fulfill all the duties of a constitutional Sovereign. He has spared\r\nno pains to make himself familiar with his people, to study their needs,\r\nto discover their wishes, to express their instincts and their ideals.\r\nHe has been able, in many ways, to promote national objects to a greater\r\nextent than, perhaps, would have been possible even with Queen Victoria.\r\nIt is no secret that he is in cordial sympathy with the feelings of the\r\nimmense majority of his subjects on the supreme issues which now\r\ndominate international politics. He has a high and keen perception of\r\nthe honour of the nation, so closely bound up with that of the Royal\r\nHouse and with his own.\"\r\n\r\nThe succeeding six months were very largely devoted to preparations for\r\nthe Coronation, but the King, nevertheless, found time to do some\r\ntravelling and visiting in the country and to carry out some very\r\nbrilliant Court functions. As an illustration of the way in which he\r\nsought to do every possible honour to his Queen-Consort, there may be\r\ninstanced a letter written, by command, in reply to an inquiry from the\r\nLord Mayor of London as to whether in drinking the second of the loyal\r\ntoasts at public gatherings the company should stand or not. Sir Dighton\r\nProbyn observed in his letter that the King had no doubt as to what was\r\nright, and that in his opinion the toast of \"Her Majesty, Queen\r\nAlexandra, the Prince and Princess of Wales and the other members of the\r\nRoyal family\" should be received standing, with a few bars of the\r\nNational Anthem and \"God bless the Prince of Wales.\" On February 11th\r\nKing Edward held the first Levée since his accession, and it was made\r\nthe occasion for a revival of much old-time splendour. The Prince of\r\nWales who had since his return home from the Colonies merged his title\r\nof Duke of Cornwall and York in the more historic and familiar\r\ndesignation, was present together with a great and representative\r\ngathering. Bishops in lawn sleeves and scarlet hoods attended by\r\nchaplains in long black gowns and white bands, great lawyers in wigs and\r\nflowing robes, foreign officers and diplomatists in gorgeous and varied\r\nuniforms, British generals and admirals, and the picturesque Windsor\r\nuniforms of the Privy Councillors, lent a brilliant appearance to a\r\nfunction at which most of the eminent men of the Kingdom were to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nTen days afterwards His Majesty visited Lord and Lady Burton at\r\nRangemore, and while there inspected the famous Bass and Company\r\nbrewery and started a special brew to be called \"the King's Ale\"--only\r\nto be used on special occasions. Early in the year it had been decided\r\nby the King to pay what might be termed a Coronation visit to Ireland,\r\naccompanied by his wife. Unfortunately, unpleasant conditions of local\r\nagitation developed, and then came the outburst of Nationalist sympathy\r\nfor the Boers, in the House of Commons, when Lord Methuen's defeat was\r\nannounced. The result was that his Ministers advised the King not to\r\nundertake the trip at the time proposed, and its postponement was\r\nannounced on March 12th, greatly to the regret of many in Ireland and\r\nout of it. Commencing on March 7th the King and Queen Alexandra paid a\r\nbrief visit to the West of England and were loyally welcomed at\r\nDartmouth, Plymouth, Stonehouse and Davenport, where certain official\r\nfunctions were performed.\r\n\r\nOn March 14th, King Edward and Queen Alexandra held their first Court,\r\nand it was expected that the occasion would be the most stately and\r\nsplendid in the modern social history of the nation. It fully equalled\r\nthese anticipations, and the scene in the ball-room of Buckingham Palace\r\neclipsed even the traditions of the French Imperial Court in the days of\r\nNapoleon III. It was well managed, it was attended by the greatest and\r\nbest representatives of English public and social life, it was unusually\r\nbrilliant in jewelry, in dresses and in uniforms, it was stately in its\r\nsetting and more animated and brighter in character than any similar\r\nfunction of the late Sovereign's reign--since its early years at least.\r\nThe same success attended succeeding and similar occasions, and it might\r\nbe distinctly appropriate to quote here views expressed by the _Daily\r\nNews_ of February 15th, 1901, when it spoke of the new reign as opening\r\nwith splendid promise for the highest interests of the country and with\r\ncomponent elements in its Court for a period of extraordinary social\r\nbrilliancy. \"King Edward,\" observed this Radical organ, \"is one of the\r\nmost popular of Sovereigns, and his beautiful Queen sheds a lustre upon\r\nhis Court for which it would be difficult to find a parallel. Amiable,\r\ntender-hearted, actively philanthropic, and possessing exquisite taste,\r\nthe Queen Consort is eminently qualified to be the bright particular\r\nstar in the shining galaxy of our Court. The Royal Princesses are most\r\nhighly accomplished and amiable ladies, each one of whom has achieved\r\nfor herself a high place in the affections of the nation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nThe Empire Tour of the New Heir to the Throne\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, had been enabled at different times\r\nin his career to visit various portions of his future realms and to\r\ncreate influences and receive impulses which have told for good in the\r\nupbuilding of the British Empire, his son and heir was destined to make\r\na tour in 1901 which was still more impressive in character and\r\ninfluential in import. The single visits of the Prince of Wales to India\r\nand Canada were made in days when they partook of an almost pioneer\r\ncharacter, and they were chiefly important in moulding crude opinions\r\ninto a more matured and organized form. The tour of the Duke and Duchess\r\nof Cornwall and York was, on the other hand, a result of clearly\r\ndeveloped conditions of Colonial power; an embodiment of existing\r\naspirations toward Empire unity; an expression of the loyalty existing\r\nbetween Mother Country and the Colonies and toward the Crown and British\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE TOUR\r\n\r\nIt was on September 17th, 1900, that the Colonial Office first announced\r\nthe assent of Her Majesty the Queen to the request presented by the\r\ncombined Australian Colonies that H. R. H. the Duke of York should open\r\ntheir newly-established Parliament in the spring of 1901. It was stated\r\nin this announcement that \"Her Majesty at the same time wishes to\r\nsignify her sense of the loyalty and devotion which have prompted the\r\nspontaneous aid so liberally offered by all the Colonies in the South\r\nAfrican war and of the splendid gallantry of her Colonial troops.\" After\r\nthe death of the Queen it was feared that the time might not be\r\nconsidered opportune for so distant a journey by the Heir to the Throne,\r\nbut on February 14th, 1901, the King announced in his speech to\r\nParliament that the proposed Australian trip would not be abandoned, and\r\nthat it would be extended to the Dominion of Canada. \"I still desire to\r\ngive effect to her late Majesty's wishes * * * as an evidence of her\r\ninterest, as well as my own, in all that concerns the welfare of my\r\nsubjects beyond the seas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM PORTSMOUTH TO MELBOURNE\r\n\r\nAs finally constituted the Royal suite consisted of H. S. H. Prince\r\nAlexander of Teck, brother of the Duchess; Lord Wenlock, a former\r\nGovernor of Madras; Lieutenant Colonel Sir Arthur Bigge, so well known\r\nas the Private Secretary for many years of the late Queen Victoria; Sir\r\nJohn Anderson, a prominent official of the Colonial Office; Sir Donald\r\nMackenzie Wallace, the eminent journalist and author; Captain, the\r\nViscount Crichton, and Lieutenant, the Duke of Roxburghe, who acted as\r\nMilitary Aides; the Hon. Derek Keppel and Commander Sir Charles Cust,\r\nR.N., who acted as Equerries; the Rev. Canon Dalton as Chaplain;\r\nCommander Godfrey-Tansell, R.N., A.D.C., and Major J. H. Bor, A.D.C.;\r\nLady Mary Lygon, Lady Catharine Coke and Mrs. Derek Keppel as\r\nLadies-in-Waiting to the Duchess. Chevalier de Martino, a marine artist;\r\nMr. Sidney Hall and Dr. A. R. Manby were also attached to the staff. On\r\nMarch 7th the Duke of York--who had now become also Duke of\r\nCornwall--left Portsmouth accompanied by his wife and his large suite to\r\nmake a nine-months' tour of the Empire; to cover a distance of 50,000\r\nmiles by sea and shore under the British flag; and to meet with varied\r\nexperiences and an enthusiasm of popular welcome which stamped the whole\r\njourney as the most remarkable Royal progress on record.\r\n\r\nThree days after leaving Portsmouth the _Ophir_, which was commanded by\r\nCommander A. L. Winslow, most luxuriously fitted up and accompanied by\r\nH. M. S. _Juno_ and the _St. George_, sighted the coast of Portugal,\r\nsailed into sunny waters off the shores at Lisbon and reached Gibraltar\r\non March 13th, where the Royal visitors were welcomed by General Sir\r\nGeorge White, of Ladysmith fame, and who had been Governor for about a\r\nyear. From the Rock the _Ophir_ was escorted by two other ships of the\r\nRoyal Navy to Malta, where Admiral Sir John Fisher and the Mediterranean\r\nfleet helped to render the welcome interesting and imposing, and from\r\nthence to Port Said and through the Suez Canal to Aden. Here a\r\npicturesque reception was given to the Duke and Duchess in a pavilion\r\nfestooned with lights and filled with Indian and Arab ladies in robes of\r\nsilks, officers in white uniforms, the Sultans of two tributary States\r\nand their dusky retinues. Surrounded by a guard of honour from the West\r\nKent Regiment, with towering mountains of brown lava in the distance,\r\nand with groups of Somalis, Arabs, Hindoos and Seedees gazing at \"the\r\ngreat lord of the seas,\" the Prince received an address of welcome. From\r\nhere, through sweltering days and heated nights, the Royal yacht\r\ntraversed the Indian Ocean until Ceylon--\"the pearl set in sapphires and\r\ncrowned with emeralds\"--was reached on April 12th.\r\n\r\nAt Colombo, amidst a revel of Oriental colour and a luxurious waste of\r\nEastern vegetation; with guards composed of planters in kharki, Bombay\r\nLancers in turbans, and Lascoreen troops in crimson and gold; surrounded\r\nby dense crowds of dancing and shouting natives, His Royal Highness\r\nreceived the official welcome of the Legislature and Municipal Councils\r\nand the Chamber of Commerce. Thence the Royal party proceeded inland to\r\nKandy, winding their way upward through an exquisite mountain region\r\nwhere the fantastic shapes and eternal green of the mountain sides and\r\nthe valleys and the gorges gleamed and radiated with colour from a\r\nmyriad tropical trees, gorgeous orchids, climbing lilies and enormous\r\nferns. The town itself was a bower of beauty, and here the visitors saw\r\nthe Temple of the Tooth, which is an object of adoration to hundreds of\r\nmillions in Burmah, China and India; the procession of the Elephants--a\r\nweird portion of the Buddhist ritual; the devil dancers, who excel the\r\nDervishes of the Soudan in the fantastic nature of their antics. On the\r\nsucceeding day the Duke received an address from the planters of the\r\nIsland, enclosed in a beautiful coffer of ivory; presented colours to\r\nthe Ceylon Mounted Infantry, and medals to men who had returned from\r\nSouth Africa; and in the evening held a Durbar, at which the native\r\nChiefs were presented.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WILD SEA OF EASTERN COLOR\r\n\r\nFrom Kandy back to Colombo went the Royal visitors, and at the capital\r\nthey found \"the white streets and blood-red earth were rivers of light\r\nand colour,\" as one picturesque correspondent described the scene. The\r\nBritish flag was there, and British merchants and the British Governor\r\nin the person of Sir J. West Ridgeway were there; but all else was a\r\nwild sea of Eastern colour; a myriad-voiced tribute of the torrid and\r\nbrilliant tropics to the power of Western civilization. After a night on\r\nboard the _Ophir_, with the war-ships in the harbour a blaze of colour\r\nand festooned with fire, the visitors left for Singapore on April 16th\r\nand arrived there five days later. Through the Straits of Malacca an\r\nexperience was had of the most intense heat and keen tropical\r\ndiscomfort. The Duke and Duchess were received at Singapore in a\r\npavilion hung with flags and flowers, by the Governor, Sir Frank\r\nSwettenham, and by the Sultans of Pahang, Perak and Selangor. This\r\ninteresting trading centre, with its four hundred and fifty million\r\ndollars' worth of commerce and its population of mingled Chinese, Dutch\r\nand Germans, was ablaze with decorations and filled with holiday-makers.\r\nA Royal reception was held in the Town-Hall on April 22nd attended by\r\nChinese, Arabs, Malays, Tamils and representatives of all the medley of\r\nblood which makes up the East. There were a dozen deputations bringing\r\naddresses and adding to the steadily accumulating caskets of gold and\r\nsilver and ivory and precious stones which the Duke was destined to\r\npossess in a measure only excelled by his Royal father's collection in\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nThe Malays contributed an elephant's tusk set in gold, the men of Penang\r\na great bamboo set in gold, and the Chinese of Malaya a fire-screen\r\nworked with Oriental skill and beauty. After this ceremony, and\r\nincluding dinner, the Duke and Duchess drove through the Chinese\r\nquarters and in the evening witnessed the strange procession of figured\r\nreptiles and demons, dragons and monsters of distorted fancy, which\r\nmarked Chinese pleasure and indicated the loyalty of the coolies as\r\ntheir costly decorations and caskets and the presence at functions of\r\nrichly-dressed men and women had already illustrated the loyalty of the\r\nmerchant class. An incident of the afternoon was the singing by five\r\nthousand school-children of mixed Eastern races and the presentation of\r\na bouquet to the Duchess. The effect of \"God Save the King\" in their\r\nquaint, native accents was described as being strangely pathetic. On the\r\nfollowing morning the _Ophir_ steamed out of the harbour bound for\r\nAustralia and left eastern civilization behind for the forms and customs\r\nof England transplanted upon Australian soil. The shores of Sumatra were\r\ncoasted, the Straits of Banka, the Sea of Java and the beautiful Straits\r\nof Sunda were traversed; the Equator was crossed and His Royal Highness\r\nwillingly subjected to the quaint and immemorial usages of the occasion;\r\nthe Indian Ocean traversed and two thousand five hundred miles of this\r\npart of the journey experienced before the shores of the\r\nisland-continent were sighted on May 1st.\r\n\r\nThe formal landing at Melbourne, for which all Australia was looking,\r\ntook place on May 6th and the splendour of the reception far exceeded\r\nall expectations. For many weeks the people of the Commonwealth had been\r\nlegislating, planning decorating and preparing for the visit of the Heir\r\nto the British Throne and his wife; the dormant loyalty of years,\r\naroused and developed by the events of the war and the despatch of\r\nthousands of troops to the front, had grown to a white-heat of interest\r\nand excitement; the completion of confederation and the union of the\r\nColonies in one great Commonwealth, which was now to be marked by the\r\nopening of the first Federal Parliament and stamped through this visit\r\nwith Royal approval and British sympathy, enhanced the public interest.\r\nThere was a great and stately setting at Melbourne for the functions\r\nwhich graced the occasion and, as the _Ophir_ rested in the waters of\r\nthe bay, surrounded by British and foreign warships, with roaring\r\nsalutes and a myriad of fluttering flags, there were excellent scenic\r\npreliminaries to the impressive landing ceremonies. From the St. Kilda\r\nPier, through miles of beautiful, decorated streets, great arches and\r\nhundreds of thousands of cheering people, the Royal couple passed to\r\nGovernment House, welcomed also on the way by a gathering of thirty-five\r\nthousand school children singing \"God Save the King.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole spectacle was an extraordinary one. Mr. E. F. Knight,\r\ncorrespondent of the London _Morning Post_ said that \"it was a day of\r\nsplendid pageants, stirring and impressive, and the extraordinary\r\nenthusiasm of the ovation given to the Duke and Duchess by the hundreds\r\nof thousands of Australians who packed the streets along the entire\r\neight miles of route must ever stand out vivid in the memory of all who\r\nwitnessed it.\" Mr. W. Maxwell, the correspondent of the _Standard_,\r\ndeclared that: \"I have seen many Royal progresses but never have I seen\r\none more hearty and spontaneous than that of the multitude of\r\nwell-dressed men, women and children who thronged the streets daily for\r\nnearly two weeks.\" The scheme of decorations was splendid, the triumphal\r\narches were authoritatively stated to be better and more numerous than\r\nanything yet seen in London itself, the gathering of Australian troops\r\nlining the streets was representative and effective, the spectators were\r\nalmost everywhere dressed in black or dark clothing as a tribute to the\r\nlate Queen, the evening illuminations were on a magnificent\r\nscale--buildings and arches and decorations being a flashing, gleaming\r\nmass of light and fire and varied brightness. A state dinner was given\r\nat Government House by Lord Hopetoun in the evening and, on the\r\nsucceeding day, a great Levée was held and addresses received. All the\r\nleaders of Australian life and society were presented and every form or\r\nphase of loyalty was embodied in the addresses presented from public\r\ninstitutions. Another state dinner followed at Government House and on\r\nMay 8th the University of Melbourne was visited and an honorary degree\r\nconferred upon His Royal Highness. A great procession of various trade\r\nand labour associations was then witnessed and the third day of the\r\nvisit concluded with a well-managed and stately Royal reception at\r\nGovernment House.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF THE COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nOn May 9th the central ceremony of the tour was performed and a new\r\nBritish Commonwealth started upon its national course. The streets\r\nthrough which the Royal progress was made were packed with enthusiastic\r\nmasses of people; the great Exhibition Building in which the Parliament\r\nof Australia was to be formally inaugurated was filled with twelve\r\nthousand persons, representative of every form of Australian life and\r\ncharacter and achievement; the scheme of decoration--blue and golden\r\nyellow and chocolate--was effective and bright, the black and white and\r\npurple of the universal mourning was brightened here and there amongst\r\nthe people by scattering bits of uniform in blue and scarlet and gold.\r\nAt noon, the distant sound of cheers and the blare of trumpets announced\r\nthe approach of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York. Amidst the\r\nstrains of the National Anthem, and accompanied by the Governor-General\r\nand Countess of Hopetoun, they took their places upon the dais. Around\r\nthe King's son and his wife were all the leaders of Australia; in front\r\nof them, the Parliament, the classes and a substantial section of the\r\nmasses. The Earl of Hopetoun read some formal prayers and then gave\r\nplace to His Royal Highness who, in clear and distinct tones read his\r\nspeech to Parliament and the people. In it he spoke of himself as\r\nfulfilling the wish of the late Queen Victoria and his father, the King,\r\nand as representing their deep interest in Australia and warm\r\nappreciation of Australian help in the war and loyalty to the Crown. Of\r\nthe future, His Majesty felt assured.\r\n\r\n     \"The King is satisfied that the wisdom and patriotism which have\r\n     characterized the exercise of the wide powers of self-government\r\n     hitherto enjoyed by the Colonies will continue to be displayed in\r\n     the exercise of the still wider powers with which the United\r\n     Commonwealth has been endowed. His Majesty feels assured that the\r\n     enjoyment of these powers will, if possible, enhance that loyalty\r\n     and devotion to his Throne and Empire of which the people of\r\n     Australia have already given such signal proofs. It is His\r\n     Majesty's earnest prayer that this union, so happily achieved, may,\r\n     under God's blessing, prove an instrument for still further\r\n     promoting the welfare and advancement of his subjects in Australia,\r\n     and for the strengthening and consolidation of his Empire.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke then declared the Parliament open in the name and on behalf of\r\nhis Majesty. He also read a cablegram just received from the King: \"My\r\nthoughts are with you on the day of the important ceremony. Most\r\nfervently do I wish Australia prosperity and happiness.\" The members of\r\nParliament then took the oath of allegiance administered by Lord\r\nHopetoun. Meanwhile, as His Royal Highness declared the Houses of\r\nParliament open, and while the immense standing audience was making the\r\nbuilding echo with a mighty cheer, the Duchess touched an electric\r\nbutton, and from every school-house in the Commonwealth there waved the\r\nUnion Jack as a sign that the great function was completed. Amidst\r\ncheering multitudes the Royal couple then drove back to Government\r\nHouse. In the evening a brilliant concert was given under the auspices\r\nof the Commonwealth Government. On the following day fifteen thousand\r\nAustralian troops were reviewed in the presence of one hundred and forty\r\nthousand people--infantry, mounted men, engineers, army service corps,\r\narmy medical corps, ambulance corps and cadets--representative of all\r\nthe States and of all branches of the system together with blue-jackets\r\nand marines from the Royal Navy.\r\n\r\nThen came a state dinner at Government House. On May 11th an afternoon\r\nreception was given by the Victorian Government and Parliament at the\r\nsame place, and on Monday May 13th, His Royal Highness and the Duchess\r\nvisited the famous golden city of Ballarat, inspected one of its great\r\nmines and laid the foundation-stone of a monument to Australian soldiers\r\nwho had fallen in South Africa. Tuesday saw an interesting\r\nschool-children's fête and a reception by the Mayor and Corporation of\r\nMelbourne. On May 14th, Their Royal Highnesses presented prizes to the\r\nscholars of the united Grammar Schools of Victoria, and the Prince spoke\r\nto the boys of the stately and historical events of the past few days.\r\n\"Keep up your traditions and think with pride of those educated in your\r\nschools who have become distinguished public servants of the state, or\r\nwho have fought, or are still fighting, for the Empire in South Africa.\"\r\nTo another great gathering of twenty thousand children the Duke was both\r\neloquent and impressive. \"May your lives be happy and prosperous, but\r\ndo not forget that the youngest of us have responsibilities which\r\nincrease as time goes on. If I may offer you advice I should say: Be\r\nthorough, do your level best in whatever work you may be called upon to\r\nperform. Remember that we are all fellow-subjects of the British Crown.\r\nBe loyal, yes, to your parents, your country, your King and your God.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a rousing farewell from the people of Melbourne, a special train\r\nwas taken on May 18th by the Royal couple for the capital of Queensland.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT BRISBANE AND SYDNEY\r\n\r\nEvery town, or settlement, or mining camp on the way contributed its\r\ncheers and shouts from crowds of sturdy Australians, and on May 20th,\r\nBrisbane was reached and an enthusiastic welcome received in the drive\r\nthrough crowded and beautifully decorated streets. At Government House,\r\nwhere the Royal guests were received by Lord Lamington,\r\nLieutenant-Governor of the State, twenty-two deputations attended to\r\npresent addresses--as compared with forty-eight at Melbourne. In the\r\nevening, a brilliant illumination of the city marked the event. On the\r\nfollowing day a review of troops took place, and the Duke and Duchess\r\nenjoyed the patriotic singing and happy sports of some five thousand\r\nchildren. The evening saw an aboriginal Corrobberee performed for their\r\nbenefit, and on the 23rd of May, the foundation-stone of a new Anglican\r\nCathedral, which was being erected as a memorial to the late Queen\r\nVictoria, was laid by His Royal Highness amid appropriate and dignified\r\nceremonial. In the afternoon the Agricultural Exhibition was visited and\r\na splendid demonstration of welcome received from over thirty thousand\r\npeople. The following and last day at Brisbane included a Levée, an\r\nafternoon reception and a concert. Each evening had seen a formal state\r\nbanquet.\r\n\r\nOn May 24th the route was taken for Sydney, and a stop was made\r\nnear Combooya for a picnic in the bush, or \"billy tea.\" Newcastle\r\ngave the Royal couple a rousing reception, and at Haukesbury the\r\n_Ophir_ was boarded and the trip up the splendid harbour of Sydney\r\ncommenced--escorted by warships and welcomed by the roar of cannon from\r\nships and shore. As the Duke and Duchess landed amid cheering sailors,\r\npealing bells and the shouts of a massed concourse of people stretching\r\nfar back from the landing-place, they were received at a sort of\r\ngraceful portal, decked with flags, flowers and semi-tropical foliage,\r\nby the Governor-General, the Federal and State Governors and Premiers,\r\nthe Mayor and others. The procession then passed along a three-mile\r\nroute to Government House with bands at intervals playing the\r\never-present National Anthem, with beautiful decorations and arches, and\r\nwith cheering crowds, fluttering handkerchiefs and waving flags in every\r\ndirection. In the evening there was the usual state dinner and more than\r\nusually striking illuminations. Of this reception the Sydney _Morning\r\nHerald_ said the next day: \"The acquisition of territory is a triumph of\r\nnational achievement; but it is a small thing beside this re-creation of\r\na new Britain in another hemisphere. The demonstration in Sydney\r\nyesterday embodied the message to this effect which our people desire to\r\ntransmit by favour of the Duke and Duchess to the centre of Empire.\"\r\n\r\nThe ensuing event was a Royal review of nine thousand troops with the\r\npresence of one hundred and fifty thousand people as observers. Then\r\ncame a brilliant Reception at Government House, and on the morning of\r\nMay 29th a Levée attended by two thousand citizens and at which\r\ntwenty-four addresses were received--including the various\r\ndenominations, the Masons, and the Orangemen. That of the city was in a\r\nbeautiful gold and jewelled casket. To these His Royal Highness replied\r\nin eloquent language, and then knighted the Mayor of Sydney, Dr. James\r\nGraham, as he had already done the Mayor of Melbourne. A state dinner\r\nfollowed with continued evening illuminations. The naval depot at Garden\r\nIsland was visited in the morning, and in the afternoon a naval review\r\nwitnessed. A second Reception followed at Government House, and on the\r\nsucceeding day the commemoration-stone of a Queen Victoria Memorial\r\naddition to the Prince Alfred Hospital was laid by the Duke. In his\r\nspeech he expressed a doubt \"whether anymore fitting memorial to that\r\ngreat life could have been chosen, for sympathy with the suffering was\r\nan all-pervading element in the noble and beautiful character of her who\r\nwas your first Patron and with whose name the Hospital will now be\r\nassociated for all time.\" At the University of Sydney the Royal visitor\r\nwas given an honorary degree amid the amusing chaff of a reception which\r\nwas as hearty and enthusiastic as it was hilarious. A Citizen's Concert\r\nfollowed in the evening, and on the next day His Royal Highness\r\nconferred fourteen hundred medals upon volunteers who had returned from\r\nthe war. In the afternoon there was a brilliant garden party at\r\nGovernment House. On Sunday a sermon was listened to at St. Andrew's\r\nCathedral, preached by Archbishop Saumarez Smith, and Monday being the\r\nDuke's birthday was observed as a public holiday. In the afternoon a\r\nvisit was paid to the Young People's Industrial Exhibition where five\r\nthousand school children sang a special Ode for the occasion. In the\r\nafternoon the Duke departed for a couple of days shooting, and the\r\nDuchess visited the neighbouring Blue Mountains.\r\n\r\nOn June 6th, after a very cordial \"send-off\" from the people, the Royal\r\nparty boarded the _Ophir_ and started for Auckland, New Zealand. Five\r\ndays later they found that loyal city alive with enthusiasm, crowded\r\nwith people and decorated to the extreme limit. They were welcomed by\r\nthe Governor, Lord Ranfurly and the Premier, Mr. R. J. Seddon. The\r\nlatter presented an address in a superb casket made of New Zealand wood\r\nand gold, silver, and enamel, in the shape of a Maori war canoe. The\r\nceremony of presentation and the reply occurred on board ship.\r\nImmediately upon landing the Duchess touched the key of a telegraph\r\ninstrument, and flags waved and guns roared a welcome in every city and\r\ntown of New Zealand. The popular welcome in the streets was tumultuous\r\nand the arches particularly impressive, while one of the incidents of\r\nthe Royal progress to Government House was a living Union Jack composed\r\nof two thousand children dressed to fit the design. In the afternoon\r\neleven addresses were received, and during his reply the Duke said: \"I\r\nlook forward to making known to His Majesty how strong I have found the\r\nfeeling of common brotherhood and readiness to share in the\r\nresponsibilities of the Empire, and earnestly trust that the results of\r\nthe journey maybe to stimulate the interest of the different countries\r\nin each other, and so draw even closer the bonds which now unite them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL WELCOME IN NEW ZEALAND\r\n\r\nA state dinner followed this event and an evening Reception. The\r\nsucceeding day a Royal review of forty-three hundred troops occurred,\r\nwith twelve thousand spectators, and was followed by a luncheon to four\r\nhundred veterans of the South African and Maori wars, at which the Duke\r\nof Cornwall and York made one of the several _impromptu_ speeches\r\ndelivered during his tour. Speaking of the combination of old veterans\r\nand young soldiers he said: \"There is nothing like a chip of the old\r\nblock\"--to which some one responded with \"You're one yourself\"--\"when\r\none knows that the old block was hard, of good grain and sound to the\r\ncore, and if, in the future, whenever and wherever the Mother-hand is\r\nstretched across the sea, it can reckon on a grasp such as New Zealand\r\nhas given in the present.\" This speech evoked tremendous cheering.\r\nLater, the foundation-stone of the Queen Victoria School for Maori Girls\r\nwas laid, and in the evening, after a state dinner at Government House,\r\nthe Royal visitors attended a Reception given by the Mayor, and drove\r\nthrough splendidly illuminated streets. The next few days were spent\r\namongst that most picturesque, gallant and chivalrous of native\r\npeoples--the Maoris. Expressions of the most intense and unaffected\r\nloyalty and contentment with British rule were universal. Most\r\ninteresting sights were witnessed and Maori customs studied--including\r\nwar and other dances, songs of welcome and of challenge to enemies, and\r\nmimic battles fought with native skill and zest.\r\n\r\nWellington was reached on Waterloo Day (June 18th) and the route to\r\nGovernment House was spanned by a dozen handsome arches--two of which\r\nhad been erected by the enthusiastic Maoris. After the conferring of\r\nsome knighthood honours the Royal visitors in the afternoon watched a\r\nprocession of Friendly Societies and laid the foundation-stone of a new\r\nTown Hall. In the evening there were the usual state dinner, Reception\r\nand illuminations. On the following day three hundred medals were\r\npresented to South African veterans and seventeen deputations received.\r\nA state Reception was attended at the Parliament Buildings in the\r\nevening and the next day was devoted to visiting certain great\r\nindustries and charitable institutions. On June 20th the\r\nfoundation-stone of new Government Railway offices was laid amid\r\ntorrents of rain and then the departure was made for Christchurch which\r\nwas reached in a few hours amid the welcome of pealing bells, cheering\r\npeople and roaring guns. Here the foundation-stone of a statue of Queen\r\nVictoria was laid in the presence of a great throng of people. The\r\nSunday sermon of next day was preached by the Bishop of Christchurch\r\nand, on Monday, June 24th, a review of eleven thousand troops was held\r\n(including three thousand cadets) in the presence of sixty thousand\r\nspectators. A feature of the drive to the review ground was a welcome\r\nsung by eight thousand school children. A luncheon to the war veterans\r\nwas also given here and militant New Zealand was well represented in the\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\nDunedin was reached by train on the following evening and in the Royal\r\nsaloon the Hon. John Mackenzie--whose health had prevented him attending\r\nthe formal ceremony at Wellington--was knighted by the Duke and\r\npersonally invested with his Order. The city was found to be spanned\r\neverywhere with arches. Several functions were combined here and His\r\nRoyal Highness received addresses in a special pavilion, presented\r\nmedals and inspected the veterans. The Corporation address was in a box\r\nmodelled after a Maori meeting-house and made of gold, silver and\r\nbronze. Another military luncheon followed and in the afternoon a\r\nchildren's demonstration was attended and the Pastoral and Horticultural\r\nShows visited. At Lyttleton, on the following day, another\r\nfoundation-stone of a Queen Victoria statue was laid and then the Royal\r\ncouple left for Tasmania after the Duke had issued a farewell address\r\nspeaking of the enthusiasm of his reception, the loyal and military\r\nspirit of the people, the splendid qualities of the Maoris and the\r\nexquisite beauty of New Zealand scenery.\r\n\r\nThe Hobart welcome was given on July 3rd and a most tasteful, loyal and\r\nenthusiastic one it was. There were a dozen triumphal arches and the\r\ncivic address was presented in a beautiful pavilion specially erected.\r\nThe usual state dinner and Reception followed. In the morning a Levée\r\nwas held and thirty addresses received from the Churches and Friendly\r\nSocieties, the Freemasons and the Orangemen, the Half-castes and the\r\nChinese. During his reply the Duke referred to the Island's entry into\r\nthe Commonwealth and said: \"I trust that the hopes and aspirations which\r\nprompted her people to enter this great national union may be fully\r\nrealized in the future prosperity of the Commonwealth and in the\r\ngreatness, power and solidarity of the Empire.\" In the afternoon the\r\nfoundation-stone of a statue to Tasmanian soldiers who had fallen in the\r\nwar was laid by the Duke and an eloquent speech delivered in which\r\nreference was made to the event as being a testimony to \"that living\r\nspirit of race, of pride in a common heritage and of a fixed resolve to\r\njoin in maintaining that heritage; which sentiment, irresistible in its\r\npower, has inspired and united the peoples of this vast Empire.\" A\r\nlog-chopping contest was then witnessed followed by an _impromptu_ visit\r\nto inspect an arch in a poor and squalid part of the city. Another\r\nReception was held in the evening accompanied by illuminations on sea\r\nand land. The succeeding day saw a review of two thousand troops, the\r\npresentation of war medals, a children's demonstration, a trades'\r\nprocession, a Reception by the Mayor in the City Hall with the singing\r\nof a special Ode, and illuminations and a fire brigade procession in the\r\nevening. Sunday was spent quietly and then the Royal yacht sailed for\r\nAdelaide, the capital of South Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN SOUTH AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA\r\n\r\nHere the Duke and Duchess were formally received on July 8th by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, Lord Tennyson, and his Ministers, and\r\nenthusiastically welcomed in crowded and tastefully decorated streets,\r\nbathed in a bright and genial sunshine. There were four arches--though\r\n£2000 of the grant had been expended on the poor instead of on temporary\r\ndecorations. At the Town-Hall an address was received and at the the\r\nsame time twelve hundred homing pigeons were liberated to carry news of\r\nthe Royal arrival to all parts of the State. A state banquet followed in\r\nthe evening and after the Levée on the next day a number of addresses\r\nwere received. Meanwhile the Duchess visited the two local hospitals.\r\nHer Royal Highness also attended a football match in the afternoon and\r\nreceived a brilliant assemblage of people in the evening--the Duke\r\nbeing compelled to have a tooth extracted. On the succeeding day the Art\r\nGallery was visited and a bust of the late Lord Tennyson unveiled and an\r\nhonorary degree accepted from the Adelaide University by His Royal\r\nHighness, who also laid the corner-stone of a new building in connection\r\nwith this institution. Later, a demonstration of six thousand children\r\nwas attended and a Reception held in the evening. The next day was\r\ndevoted to shooting and to seeing an exhibition of sheep-shearing,\r\nbullock-riding and buck-jumping, with a military Tattoo in the evening\r\nand the usual spectacle of brilliant illuminations. The last day, but\r\none, in South Australia included in its programme the laying of a\r\nfoundation-stone for a Maternity Home in memory of Queen Victoria, and\r\nthe review of four thousand troops with a state concert at night. On\r\nSunday, a recently-completed Nave in St. Peter's Cathedral was dedicated\r\nby the Bishops of Adelaide and Newcastle and a tablet to South African\r\nheroes unveiled by the Duke.\r\n\r\nThe voyage was then resumed for Freemantle and Perth, in Western\r\nAustralia, but stress of weather on July 2nd caused the _Ophir_ to put\r\nin at Albany, instead, and there the surprised and delighted people gave\r\nthe Duke and Duchess a rousing welcome as they took the train for Perth.\r\nThe State capital was reached two days later and, amid perfect weather,\r\nthrough great crowds and a dozen splendid arches, the Royal progress was\r\nmade to the Town Hall where the inevitable address was received. In the\r\nevening there was the usual state dinner given by the Governor, Sir\r\nArthur Lawley, and ensuing Reception. On the following day the programme\r\nincluded a Levée, the reception of addresses, the laying of the\r\nfoundation-stone of the State's monument to its sons lying on the South\r\nAfrican veldt, the presentation of war medals and a civic Reception and\r\nstate concert. The last two days of the visit were devoted to attendance\r\nat a state service in St. John's Cathedral where the Duke unveiled a\r\nbrass tablet in memory of South African heroes, laying the\r\nfoundation-stone of a new building connected with the Museum, a visit to\r\nthe Mint, an enthusiastic welcome given by a children's demonstration\r\nand a visit to the Zoological Gardens. Before sailing for South Africa\r\non July 26th, the new Heir Apparent addressed a formal farewell to the\r\npeople of Australia in the form of a letter to the Earl of Hopetoun.\r\nReference was made at some length to the twenty-five thousand troops\r\nreviewed during the visit, to the educational systems of the States, to\r\nthe loyalty exhibited to the King and the generous personal reception\r\ngiven by the people, to the hospitality of Governments and the good\r\nmanagement and kindness of officials. Finally he said:\r\n\r\n     \"We leave with many regrets, mitigated, however, by the hope that\r\n     while we have gained new friendships and good will, something may\r\n     also have been achieved towards strengthening and welding together\r\n     the Empire, through the sympathy and interest which have been\r\n     displayed in our journey both at home and in the Colonies. The\r\n     Commonwealth and its people will ever have a warm place in our\r\n     hearts. We shall always take the keenest interest in its welfare,\r\n     and our earnest prayer will be for its continued advancement not\r\n     only in material progress, but in all that tends to make life noble\r\n     and happy.\"\r\n\r\nThe response of the press to this Message was pronounced and may be\r\nrepresented by the statement of the Melbourne _Argus_ on June 29th, that\r\nfrom first to last \"the Australasian visit was a success, in every way\r\nworthy of its statesmanlike conception and purpose.\" The Royal couple\r\ncame from King and Empire, and their mission was personally performed\r\nwith unique success. \"Everywhere they were received with demonstrations\r\nof delighted loyalty. They were living symbols of British unity. From\r\nall they will take back a reciprocal message to King and Empire. There\r\nis not a single blemish upon the record of the visit. Not one imprudent\r\nword was spoken, not one slight left a stinging recollection.\"\r\n\r\nMauritius was reached on August 4th, and the brightly-decorated streets\r\nof the capital were crowded with Creoles, Mohammedans, Hindoos, and\r\nChinese, while the French language was everywhere, and the English\r\ntongue seldom heard. Tropical flowers and foliage were brilliant and\r\nplentiful in the plans of decoration, and the streets were lined with a\r\ncombination of Bengal Infantry, Royal Artillery and Engineers. At\r\nGovernment House the first investiture of knighthood in the Island's\r\nhistory was held and various addresses received. The foundation-stone of\r\na statue of Queen Victoria was then laid, a procession of Hindoo and\r\nChinese children witnessed and a drive taken through the town. The next\r\nfour days were spent in strict privacy at the residence of Sir Charles\r\nBruce, the Governor, with the exception of a state dinner and Reception\r\non the first evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL RECEPTION IN SOUTH AFRICA\r\n\r\nWar-tossed South Africa was sighted on August 13th and the landing took\r\nplace at Durban, where the welcome was enthusiastic. There were many\r\narches and excellent decorations, eleven thousand singing children,\r\ncrowded streets and shouting spectators who included Zulus, Kaffirs of\r\nall kinds, Indian coolies and the whole white population. In a Royal\r\npavilion, specially constructed, addresses were presented and answered,\r\nand the train was taken to Pietermaritzburg after luncheon with the\r\nMayor and a distinguished gathering. A deputation of ladies had,\r\nmeanwhile, presented the Duchess with a table-gong made of pompom shells\r\nmounted on a rhinoceros horn. The railway to the capital of Natal was\r\npatrolled by mounted troops, and the drive through the illuminated city\r\nand densely-packed streets to Government House was done at night. On the\r\nfollowing day the place was found to be handsomely decorated with many\r\narches and the first function was the Royal inauguration of a new Town\r\nHall. The cheering of the people was intense and continuous in the\r\nstreets. Afterwards addresses were presented--that of the Corporation\r\nin a singularly beautiful casket of ivory and gold. In his eloquent\r\nspeech the Duke referred to the events and sacrifices of the war. They\r\nhad not been in vain. \"Never in our history did the pulse of Empire beat\r\nmore in unison; and the blood which has been shed on the veldt has\r\nsealed for ever our unity, based upon a common loyalty and a\r\ndetermination to share, each of us according to our strength, the common\r\nburden.\" An address was also presented from Johannesburg and specially\r\nreplied to.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon there was an extraordinary assemblage, composed of the\r\ndignitaries of political and social life and the pick of the great\r\nBritish army in South Africa--a quarter of a million fighting men. It\r\nwas a gathering of eleven holders of the V.C., and forty-three holders\r\nof the honour next in degree for bravery in the field--the D.S.O. These\r\nfamous medals were conferred by the Duke of Cornwall and York, and then\r\na great deputation of Zulu Chiefs, clad in barbaric war paraphernalia,\r\npresented loyal congratulations. A reception was held in the evening and\r\nthe city illuminated. The next day the voyage was resumed, and Simon's\r\nBay reached on August 19th. After landing, through a guard of one\r\nthousand bluejackets, and receiving an address from the Mayor, the\r\nspecial train was taken to Cape Town. There the formal reception was\r\ngiven by the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, the President of the\r\nLegislative Council, the Archbishop, the Chief Justice, the Mayor, the\r\nPresident of the Africander Bond and other officials or public men. The\r\nreception in the streets was enthusiastic, and it has been said that\r\nmore Union Jacks were displayed than at any other point on the tour. A\r\nLevée was held in the afternoon at the Parliament Buildings and two\r\nthousand citizens were presented, while addresses were received from\r\nmany public bodies in Cape Colony, Orange River Colony, and Rhodesia.\r\n\r\nA memorable event occurred on the succeeding day, when in the\r\nGovernment House grounds, His Royal Highness and the Duchess received\r\nover one hundred native chiefs who had come from all parts of South\r\nAfrica, laden with unique and peculiar gifts, clad in extraordinary\r\ncostumes and led by Lerothodi of the Basutos and Khama, the famous Chief\r\nof Bechuanaland. Short speeches were interchanged, and then the Duke and\r\nDuchess drove to Grootschur, to visit Mr. Cecil Rhodes. On the following\r\nday the Duke accepted an honorary degree from the University of Cape\r\nTown--of which he was already Chancellor--and in the afternoon received\r\nsome six thousand school children, Colonial and Dutch, who sang an Ode\r\nof welcome and presented a gift of Basuto ponies for the Royal children\r\nin far-away London. There was also an evening reception and the same\r\nsplendid illuminations which had graced the previous night. The last day\r\nof the visit included the laying of the foundation-stone of a Nurse's\r\nHome in memory of the late Queen, and of the corner-stone of the new St.\r\nGeorge's Cathedral. Despatches were interchanged with Lord Kitchener,\r\nand a letter written by His Royal Highness to the Governor, Sir Walter\r\nHely-Hutchinson, expressive of the deep gratitude of his wife and\r\nhimself for their reception and the earnest hope that peace would soon\r\nbe restored. An investiture of knighthood was also held, and on August\r\n23rd the Royal couple were once more on the _Ophir_ heading for distant\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL AT HISTORIC QUEBEC\r\n\r\nAfter a voyage in which every kind of ocean weather was experienced, or\r\nsuffered, the mighty St. Lawrence was reached, and finally the City of\r\nQuebec, on the 15th of September. The arrival was the commencement of a\r\ncontinental tour which proved a fitting crown to the whole splendid\r\nEmpire progress and a more than appropriate continuation of the King's\r\nvisit of forty years before--in which he had touched only the smaller\r\ncentral Provinces of the great railway-girdled Dominion which now\r\nwelcomed his son and his son's Consort. On Monday, September 17th, the\r\nDuke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, accompanied by the Earl of Minto,\r\nGovernor-General, and Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the Prime Minister--who had\r\ngone down the river to meet them--set their feet upon Canadian soil. The\r\nDominion Ministers were present to join in the welcome, and the\r\nprocession then passed through the city, many thousands of people lining\r\nthe streets, and three thousand French children at the St. Louis Gate\r\nsinging \"O Canada, Land of Our Ancestors.\" At the Parliament Buildings,\r\nthe Hon. S. N. Parent, Mayor of Quebec and Premier of the Province, read\r\na lengthy address which referred to this visit as a proud privilege,\r\nexpressed the renewed devotion of the citizens to the Crown and person\r\nof their Sovereign, and spoke of French-Canadians as \"a free, united and\r\nhappy people, faithful and loyal, attached to their King and country,\r\nand rejoicing in their connection with the British Empire and those\r\nnoble self-governing institutions which are the palladium of their\r\nliberties.\" In his reply the Duke referred to the success of the\r\nCanadian troops at Paardeberg, and spoke with sorrow of the death of\r\nPresident McKinley. \"It is my proud mission to come amongst you as a\r\ntoken of that feeling of admiration and pride which the King and the\r\nEmpire feel in the exploits of the Canadians who rushed to the defence\r\nof the Empire.\"\r\n\r\nA Royal procession to the Citadel followed and in the afternoon the Duke\r\nand Duchess visited Laval University, where they were received by\r\nArchbishop Bégin, the Rector, and five hundred clergymen of the\r\nArch-diocese. In the address which was read by the Archbishop reference\r\nwas made to the late Queen, to the accession of the present Sovereign,\r\nto the triumphal welcome on the banks of the mighty St. Lawrence which\r\nwas being prepared for the nation's guests, and to the pleasure of the\r\nChurch in sharing that welcome. \"To the history of our Catholic Church\r\nbelongs the honour of having forged between the English Throne and a\r\nFrench Canadian people solid bonds which neither adversity nor bribery\r\ncan sever.\" Faith in the Church and loyalty to the Crown were the\r\nlessons they desired to inculcate. The University address was then read\r\nby the Rev. O. E. Mathieu, the Rector. His Royal Highness in replying\r\nand accepting the honorary degree of LL. D., paid a high tribute to\r\nRoman Catholicism in Canada. \"I am glad to acknowledge the noble part\r\nwhich the Catholic Church in Canada has played throughout its history;\r\nthe hallowed memories of its martyred missionaries are a priceless\r\nheritage; and in the great and beneficial work of education and in\r\nimplanting and fostering a spirit of patriotism and loyalty, it has\r\nrendered signal service in Canada and the the Empire.\" In the evening, a\r\nstate dinner was held at the Citadel.\r\n\r\nDuring the ensuing morning the Royal review took place on the Plains of\r\nAbraham. It rained during the greater part of the proceedings and this,\r\ntogether with the cancellation of the proposed Reception, for which\r\nfifteen hundred invitations had been issued, threw a measure of gloom\r\nover the City. But neither the rain nor the sad death of the President\r\nof the United States could be helped and certainly the Duke never\r\nflinched from the discomforts of the former. There were some five\r\nthousand troops on the ground under command of Major-General\r\nO'Grady-Haly assisted by Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. M. Aylmer as\r\nAdjutant-General. After the parade was over, His Royal Highness\r\ndistributed the South African medals to the men and presented\r\nLieut.-Colonel R. E. W. Turner, of the Queen's Own Canadian Hussars,\r\nwith his V.C. and D.S.O. and a sword of honour from the City of Quebec.\r\nIn the evening, as on the previous one, the city was brilliantly\r\nilluminated and the ships and river showed sudden blazes of light amid\r\nthe blackness of surrounding night and through the flash of fireworks\r\nand gleam of electricity. The Royal couple gave a farewell dinner on the\r\n_Ophir_ to a select number and in the morning started for Montreal. The\r\njourney was made in the splendid train built by the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway Company for the special purposes of this tour and destined to\r\ncarry the Royal visitors all over the Dominion. Their immediate train of\r\ncars was preceded, as elsewhere throughout the country, by one bearing\r\nthe Governor-General and Lady Minto.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION AT MONTREAL AND OTTAWA\r\n\r\nVery few stops took place on the way to Montreal, where some change in\r\nthe programme was to be made owing to the President's funeral. At Port\r\nNeuf, Three River's and Lanoraie, however, a few minutes' pause had been\r\narranged. At the Montreal station the Royal couple were received by Mr.\r\nRaymond Prefontaine, M.P., Mayor of the city, in gorgeous official\r\nrobes. With him were Archbishop Bruchési, Vicar-General Racicot,\r\nArchbishop Bond, Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal, Mr. T. G. Shaughnessy,\r\nSenator Drummond, Rev. Dr. Barclay, Principal Peterson, Sir William\r\nHingston, Sir W. C. Van Horne and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. The Civic address\r\nwas read in French and the Duke replied in English. Other addresses were\r\npresented from the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society, the Daughters of\r\nthe Empire and the Baron de Hirsch Institute. There was an immense crowd\r\npresent and the proceedings concluded with the introduction of a number\r\nof Indian chiefs to His Royal Highness and the presentation of medals to\r\nthe South African veterans.\r\n\r\nThe procession through the streets to Lord Strathcona's house, where the\r\nRoyal visitors were to stay, was a rather swift drive and the throngs of\r\npeople were not given very much time to see the Duke and Duchess.\r\nElsewhere in Canada the rate was slower. Several beautiful arches\r\ndecorated the route. The cheers of the Laval students and the enthusiasm\r\nof five thousand school children on Peel Street were the most marked\r\nincidents of this parade through gaily decorated streets. In the evening\r\nLord Strathcona entertained at dinner in honour of his Royal guests and\r\nthe whole city was a blaze of light from electric illuminations and the\r\nfireworks on Mount Royal. The Reception in the evening was cancelled\r\nowing to the President's funeral. A visit was paid to the mountain in\r\nthe morning and then followed the formal functions of a busy day. At\r\nMcGill University an address was read by its Chancellor, Lord\r\nStrathcona, and an honorary degree received. Then followed an address\r\nfrom the Medical Faculty, read by Dr. Craik, and including the\r\npresentation of a casket of Labradorite--a native Canadian product. The\r\nDuke also formally opened the new Medical building.\r\n\r\nAt Laval University the decorations were most elaborate and there was a\r\ngreat assemblage of local clergy. Archbishop Bruchési extended a verbal,\r\ninstead of written, welcome and informed the Duke that the clergy and\r\nProfessors devoted themselves to training the youth of the University\r\n\"in science and in arts, in loyalty to the throne, as well as in love of\r\nreligion and country.\" An honorary degree was also given and accepted.\r\nAnother place visited was the Royal Victoria Hospital which, like McGill\r\nUniversity and its Medical Faculty, owed much to Lord Strathcona. At the\r\nDiocesan Institute an address was presented from the assembled\r\nProvincial Synod of Canada by the Lord Bishop of Toronto. In the\r\nafternoon the Duke and Duchess drove out to the Ville Marie Convent\r\nwhere they were received by the Archbishop of Montreal, the Lady\r\nSuperior and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. An address was presented and, as at\r\nLaval, the Duke replied informally though here, for the first time, he\r\nsaid a few words in French. A torchlight procession of the people,\r\ngeneral illumination of the city and more fire-works, followed in the\r\nevening. At nine o'clock on the succeeding morning the Royal couple\r\nstarted for Ottawa.\r\n\r\nThey remained in Ottawa from September 20th until September 24th. On the\r\nway to the capital a brief stop was made at Alexandria and an address\r\nreceived. The arrival at Ottawa and the Royal progress through the city\r\nwas marked by brilliant decorations, cheering crowds and finer weather\r\nthan had been the case either at Quebec or Montreal. The Civic address\r\nwas read by Major W. D. Morris in a pavilion erected on the Parliament\r\ngrounds and eighteen other addresses were received. The reply of His\r\nRoyal Highness was sympathetic and eloquent in language. It was, he\r\nsaid, impossible for him not to think of the difference between forty\r\nyears ago and the present time. \"Ottawa was then but the capital of two\r\nProvinces, yoked together in uneasy union. To-day it is a capital of a\r\ngreat and prosperous Dominion, stretching from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific Ocean, the centre of the political life and administration of a\r\ncontented and united people. The Federation of Canada stands permanent\r\namong the political events of the century just closed for its fruitful\r\nand beneficent results on the life of the people concerned.\" He hoped\r\nthat mutual toleration and sympathy would continue and be extended to\r\nthe Empire as a whole and that, more than ever, the people would remain\r\n\"determined to hold fast and maintain the proud privileges of British\r\ncitizenship.\"\r\n\r\nOn leaving for Government House the Duke and Duchess were greeted with\r\n\"The Maple Leaf,\" sung by thousands of school children and were given a\r\ngreat cheer by the students of Ottawa College. In the afternoon a visit\r\nwas paid to the Lacrosse match between the Cornwalls and Ottawas and at\r\nnight a state dinner was held at Government House. The city was\r\nilluminated on this and subsequent evenings in a way to rival the\r\nfamous effects of the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo. On the\r\nfollowing morning an investiture of knighthood was held at Government\r\nHouse followed by a drive through Hull. At noon the statue of Queen\r\nVictoria on the Parliament grounds was unveiled amid the usual\r\nsurroundings of state and soldiers and crowds. South African medals were\r\npresented by the Duke and to Lieutenant E. J. Holland was given his V.C.\r\nas well as medal. His Royal Highness was then lunched by a number of\r\nprominent gentlemen at the Rideau Club and in the afternoon a garden\r\nparty was held at Government House. In the evening there was a quiet\r\ndinner and drive through the city to see the illuminations.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Sunday was quietly observed and Christ Church\r\nCathedral attended in the morning by the Royal couple and the\r\nGovernor-General and Lady Minto. Bishop Hamilton officiated and the\r\nsermon was preached by the Rev. Mr. Kittson. The morning of September 23\r\nwas notable for the entertainment given by the lumbermen of Ottawa. The\r\nDuke and Duchess travelled on a special electric car to their\r\ndestination, went in canoes with _voyageurs_ through the rapids,\r\ndescended the famous lumberslides of the Chaudiére, witnessed a race of\r\nwar canoes, saw tree cutting and logging, watched the strange dances of\r\nthe woodsmen, ate a lumbermen's lunch in a shanty, heard the jolly songs\r\nof the _voyageurs_, and listened to a speech from a _habitant_ foreman\r\nwhich made them and all Canada laugh heartily. In the evening a\r\nbrilliant Reception was held in the Senate Chamber.\r\n\r\nAt noon on the following morning the Royal couple left for Winnipeg\r\nthrough crowded streets and cheering people. Before her departure the\r\nDuchess of Cornwall was given a handsome cape by the women of Ottawa.\r\nThe presentation was made by Lady Laurier, on behalf of the\r\ncontributors, at Government House. In Montreal a beautiful gift had also\r\nbeen made to her in the shape of a corsage ornament composed of a spray\r\nof maple leaves made of enamel and decorated with 366 diamonds and one\r\nlarge pearl. It was presented by Lady Strathcona and Mrs. George A.\r\nDrummond. The Royal journey across the continent commenced with the\r\ndeparture from Ottawa and, between the capital of the Dominion and the\r\nmetropolis of the West, a number of places were passed at a few of which\r\nthe Royal visitors paused for a brief time. At Carleton Place there was\r\na cheering crowd and gaily decorated station and singing school\r\nchildren; at Almonte the town was _en fête_ and cheering could be heard\r\nfrom even the roofs of the distant cotton mills; at Arnprior the whole\r\npopulation turned out and the decorations were extensive; at Renfrew and\r\nPembroke the same thing occurred; at Petawawa and Chalk River crowds of\r\ncountry people had gathered; at Mattawa and North Bay the stations were\r\ngaily decorated and bands played their welcome.\r\n\r\nEverywhere in the wilds of Algoma and along the rocky shores of Lake\r\nSuperior little groups of settlers might be seen at the lonely stations\r\nwatching for a sight of the Duke and Duchess. At Missanabie, a stop was\r\nmade to see a Hudson's Bay post and stockade and at White River, the\r\ncoldest place in Canada east of the Yukon, a picturesque party of\r\nIndians was seen. A stop was made at Schrieber, and the whole population\r\nturned out to see an address presented to the Duke and a bouquet to the\r\nDuchess. Late in the evening of the 25th Fort William was reached and\r\nthe school children of the town sang \"The Maple Leaf\" from an\r\nilluminated stand at the station. At Port Arthur the Duke accepted a\r\ncase of mineral specimens. Winnipeg was reached at noon of the next day\r\nafter a quick journey through the \"Lake of the Woods\" district and a\r\nsplendid welcome was accorded the Royal visitors. Flags flew everywhere\r\nand decorations abounded throughout the city. At the station about a\r\nhundred of Manitoba's leading men were gathered. The Governor-General\r\nand Lady Minto and Sir Wilfrid Laurier were also present to assist in\r\nthe welcome, as their trains had preceded the Royal party to Winnipeg.\r\nThe same order was observed in this connection throughout the Canadian\r\ntour.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN WINNIPEG AND THE WEST\r\n\r\nThe Royal procession then passed along the wide main street of the city,\r\nthrough splendid arches of wheat, to the City Hall, where Mayor\r\nArbuthnot presented the address to the Duke. Archbishop Machray then\r\npresented an address from the Church of England in Rupert's Land,\r\nexpressive of welcome and attachment to the Throne and Empire.\r\nArchbishop Langevin, on behalf of the Catholics of Manitoba and the\r\nWest, in his address dwelt upon the French pioneer labours in the\r\nNorthwest, and declared the pride felt by the people of his Church in\r\nhaving defended England's noble standard, even at the expense of their\r\nblood. \"We thank God for the amount of religious liberty we enjoy under\r\nthe British flag.\" In his reply, the Duke of Cornwall and York spoke of\r\nthe marvellous progress made by Winnipeg--\"the busy centre of what has\r\nbecome the great granary of the Empire, the political centre of an\r\nactive and enterprising population in the full enjoyment of the\r\nprivileges and institutions of British citizenship.\" Then followed the\r\npresentation of South African medals and a luncheon at Government House\r\nattended by many leading citizens. In the afternoon the University of\r\nManitoba was visited and an address read by Archbishop Machray,\r\nChancellor of the University. A state dinner was given in the evening at\r\nGovernment House and about ten o'clock the Royal visitors passed through\r\nthe crowded and illuminated streets of the city to the train, followed\r\nby a torchlight procession and the sound of many cheers.\r\n\r\nAt Regina, on September 27th, a loyal welcome was received. The\r\nprocession to Government House was followed by the reception of twelve\r\naddresses from Territorial centres and the distribution of South African\r\ndecorations. A luncheon was given by Lieutenant-Governor Forget, and at\r\n3 P.M., the Royal visitors departed for Calgary. There, on the following\r\nmorning, they witnessed a thoroughly typical Western scene and received\r\na Western welcome. The streets were gaily decorated and many cheers\r\nfollowed the Duke and Duchess as they proceeded to Victoria Park, where\r\na review of 240 Mounted Police was held, medals presented to the South\r\nAfrican veterans and Major Belcher decorated with his C.M.G. At another\r\npoint near the city the Duke then met a large party of Indians and\r\nreceived from them an address which recited their past privations and\r\npresent progress and expressed the hope that when His Royal Highness\r\nshould accede to the Throne it would be \"to long reign over us, our\r\nchildren, and the other many peoples of the British Empire in peaceful\r\nsecurity and abundant happiness.\"\r\n\r\nSpeeches were made by a number of the Chiefs and the Duke replied in\r\nmost picturesque terms. \"The Indian is a live man, his words are true\r\nwords and he never breaks faith. And he knows that it is the same with\r\nthe Great King, my father, and with those whom he sends to carry out his\r\nwishes. His promises last as long as the sun shall shine and the waters\r\nflow. And care will ever be taken that nothing shall come between the\r\nGreat King and you, his faithful children.\" Indian children then sang\r\nthe National Anthem, and, after witnessing an extraordinary spectacle of\r\nbroncho busting and cow-boy riding, the journey was resumed to the\r\nRockies towering up on the horizon. Sunday was spent in traversing the\r\nmarvellous panorama of nature which spreads out through the Rockies and\r\nSelkirks, the mighty glaciers, rushing rivers, lightning changes of\r\ncolour and varied splendours of scene. A stop was made at Banff and at\r\nLaggan and Field, the stations were tastefully decorated with evergreens\r\nand flags. Revelstoke was passed, the lower levels of the mountains\r\ntraversed, the plains reached, and on the morning of September 30th the\r\nRoyal train drew into Vancouver.\r\n\r\nMounted Police and blue-jackets from the fleet were there and as the\r\nprocession left for the Court House, where addresses were to be\r\nreceived, the deep-mouthed guns of the fleet in the harbour, the ringing\r\nbells of the city churches and the cheers of the people sounded a\r\ncombined welcome. Through several arches and gay decorations--the\r\nJapanese and Chinese arches being noteworthy--the parade proceeded, with\r\nthe Premier of Canada in a carriage at its head. At the pavilion, in\r\nfront of the Court House, the Royal visitors were received by Mayor\r\nTownley, an address was presented and a bouquet given to the Duchess as\r\nwell as a handsome portfolio of British Columbia views from the Local\r\nCouncil of women. The Duke was very brief in his reply. The next thing\r\non the programme was the opening of the new Drill-Hall and the\r\npresentation of South African medals. The Boy's Brigade was also\r\ninspected. After luncheon a visit was paid to the Hastings Saw-Mill, and\r\na drive taken through the splendid trees and vistas of Stanley Park. At\r\nBrockton Point a drill of school children was held in sight of some\r\nseven thousand persons and a grand stand full of children looking on.\r\nHere the Duke presented a silken banner to the school which had won the\r\nprize for drilling and was given an enthusiastic reception. As the C. P.\r\nR. steamer, _Empress of India_, with the Royal party on board, passed in\r\nthe evening across the Bay of Victoria the waters were illuminated with\r\nmultitudes of lighted craft and the city was a vision of golden light\r\nwith a background of surrounding blackness.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by five warships, the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall arrived\r\nat Victoria on the morning of October 1st and were greeted by\r\nLieut.-Governor Sir Henri Joly de Lotbiniére as they landed. The drive\r\nthrough the decorated streets to the Parliament Buildings was the scene\r\nof much cheering and at the destination Their Royal Highnesses were\r\nreceived by the officials of the Province and an immense surrounding\r\ncrowd. Mayor Hayward presented the Civic address and various deputations\r\nfollowed him. In his reply the Duke made no allusion to the\r\ninternational relations mentioned in one of the addresses but declared\r\nthat Canadian sacrifices in South Africa had \"forged another link in the\r\ngolden chain which binds together the brotherhood of the Empire.\" Medals\r\nwere distributed and the school children inspected. A drive followed\r\nthrough the gay streets of the city out to Esquimalt, where a barge was\r\ntaken to the Admiral's flagship and luncheon served, with Real-Admiral\r\nBickford as the host.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the Agricultural Exhibition at Victoria was opened and\r\nin the evening the city and Parliament Buildings were brilliantly\r\nlighted up by electricity and fireworks. After a state dinner at the\r\nLieutenant-Governor's residence a Reception was held at the Parliament\r\nBuildings. The following day was a very quiet one. Her Royal Highness\r\ncalled on Mrs. Dunsmuir, wife of the Prime Minister, to express sympathy\r\nover a terrible disaster which had occurred at the Extension Mines and,\r\nafter luncheon, the Duke and Duchess visited the Royal Jubilee Hospital.\r\nDuring the day the latter was presented by the miners of Atlin with a\r\nbracelet of gold nuggets. Late in the afternoon farewells were made and\r\nthe voyage back to Vancouver commenced. From Vancouver they departed in\r\nthe morning, the Duchess going to Banff where she stayed for a couple of\r\ndays and the Duke going on to Poplar Point, Manitoba, forty miles from\r\nWinnipeg, where he enjoyed a couple of days' shooting with Senator\r\nKirchhoffer. Winnipeg was reached on October 8th. They were cordially\r\nwelcomed again and a visit was paid to Oglivie's Mill--said to be the\r\nlargest in the Empire--and the direct journey for Toronto was then\r\ncommenced. From North Bay, through the Muskoka region and on to the\r\ncapital of Ontario, there were cheering crowds at every station.\r\nHuntsville, Bracebridge, and Gravenhurst were marked in this respect. At\r\nOrillia, Barrie and Newmarket short stops were made and, amidst gay\r\ndecorations, singing children and cheering throngs, the Duke and Duchess\r\nappeared on the platform, received a few presentations and in the case\r\nof Her Royal Highness accepted bouquets of flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORABLE RECEPTION AT TORONTO\r\n\r\nThe occurrences at Toronto during the Royal visit were of a character to\r\nmake history. The morning of October 10th, when the Duke and Duchess\r\narrived was gloomy and later on the rain poured with steady and\r\ndepressive persistence. But it did not seem to affect the patience of\r\nthe waiting crowds or dampen the enthusiasm of the reception. A special\r\nand beautiful station had been erected at the head of St. George Street\r\nand here, amid the patriotic songs of 6000 children, the Royal visitors\r\nwere received by the Hon. G. W. Ross, Premier of Ontario and a number of\r\nhis Ministers. The Vice-regal party and Sir Wilfrid Laurier had, as\r\nusual, arrived first. The procession followed through miles of decorated\r\nstreets and throngs of cheering people until the City Hall was reached\r\nand a scene of colour and serried masses of people witnessed such as\r\nToronto had never known. The streets were lined with ten thousand troops\r\nstretching from the station to the Hall and the Alexandra Gate, erected\r\nby the Daughters of the Empire, and the Foresters' Arch, erected by the\r\nIndependent Order of Foresters, were notable features of the welcome. At\r\nthe City Hall the Royal couple were received by Mayor O. A. Howland and\r\nwelcomed by the singing of a large trained chorus of voices. An immense\r\ncrowd was present and addresses were handed in by eleven deputations and\r\nreplied to at some length.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon a presentation was made to the Duchess by Miss\r\nMowat, daughter of the Lieutenant-Governor, on behalf of the women of\r\nToronto. It consisted of a writing set made of Klondike gold and\r\nCanadian amethysts and chrystal. The case was made of Canadian maple. A\r\nstate dinner was given at Government House in the evening by Sir Oliver\r\nMowat and the Royal couple afterwards attended a Concert at Massey Hall\r\nwhere Madame Calvé and others sang. The streets were filled with\r\nenthusiastic crowds far into the night and the illuminations were\r\nsomething unequalled in the history of the city and unexcelled by any\r\nothers during the Royal tour in Canada. Powerful search-lights from the\r\ntop of the City Hall tower were an unique feature of the demonstration.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning--October 12th--the Royal review took place on\r\nthe Exhibition grounds. It was unquestionably the most brilliant and\r\neffective military spectacle ever seen in Canada. Nearly eleven thousand\r\nmen were mustered under command of Major-General O'Grady-Haly. Before\r\nthe review commenced His Royal Highness presented the South African\r\nmedals to a number of the soldiers and the V.C. to Major H. C. Z.\r\nCockburn. To the latter also was given a sword of honour on behalf of\r\nthe City Council. Colours were presented to the Royal Canadian Regiment\r\nof Infantry and the Royal Canadian Dragoons in the name of the King and\r\nas a mark of appreciation for their services in the war. The march past\r\nthen took place. There were said to be twenty-five thousand people on\r\nthe grounds and the streets and approaches were lined with many other\r\nthousands. In the afternoon the Duke and Duchess visited the Bishop\r\nStrachan School and the Duke planted a tree in Queen's Park and reviewed\r\nthe Fire Brigade. Then came the state visit to Toronto University, the\r\npresentation of an address by the Chancellor, Sir William Meredith, and\r\nthe bestowal of the honorary degree of LL. D.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a Reception was held in the Parliament Buildings when\r\ntwo thousand people shook hands, amid brilliant surroundings, with the\r\nHeir to the Throne and his wife. Prior to this a very large state dinner\r\nhad been held in the halls of the same building with His Excellency the\r\nGovernor-General as host. The city was again most brilliantly\r\nilluminated and filled with waiting throngs anxious to see and cheer the\r\nRoyal visitors. Early in the following morning they left Toronto for a\r\nrapid trip through Western Ontario. As the Royal train rushed through\r\nthe populous centres, or quiet villages of this rich section of the\r\ncountry, every railway station was crowded with cheering people anxious\r\nfor a sight of their future Sovereign and his Consort. At Brampton a\r\nshort stop was made, and a mass of beautiful roses, carried by eight\r\nchildren, was presented to the Duchess from the well-known rosaries of\r\nthe town. At Guelph a platform had been erected near the station, and\r\nhere two thousand school children sang patriotic songs. At Berlin there\r\nwas another chorus and another exquisite bouquet of flowers for the\r\nDuchess. There was a great crowd of people at this point, and the\r\nchildren carried branches of maple leaves, as well as flags, which they\r\nwaved while the singing was going on and the presentations were being\r\nmade by Mayor Bowlby. The City of Stratford had a gaily decorated\r\nstation, eight thousand cheering citizens and children singing \"The\r\nMaple Leaf.\" An arch had been erected festooned with evergreens and\r\nflowers. The visit to London was a matter of more formality and length.\r\nThe city was packed with people from outlying points, and the reception\r\nto the Royal couple as they drove through decorated streets to the\r\nVictoria Park was most enthusiastic. There an address was proffered by\r\nMayor Rumball. After the Duke's reply colours were presented to the 7th\r\nRegiment and the departure took place through the same kind of cheering\r\nthrongs which had previously lined the streets.\r\n\r\nFrom London the route was taken up to Niagara. Every station was\r\ncrowded with people, and in the vineyard and fruit region a brief stop\r\nwas made at Grimsby. Finally, the Royal train ran into the historic\r\nvillage of Niagara-on-the-Lake, and there, at the Queen's Royal Hotel,\r\nthe visitors found elaborate preparations for their comfort during the\r\nensuing day of rest. Masses of flowers and fruit were displayed as\r\nfurther proof of the diverse productions of the Dominion. Sunday was,\r\nhowever, a busy day in some respects. In the morning the steamer was\r\ntaken to Queenston, and from thence a special electric car conveyed the\r\nRoyal couple along the banks of the mighty Niagara, past Brock's\r\nmonument and the scene of the historic conflict upon Queenston Heights,\r\nand on to the famous whirlpool where half an hour of sight-seeing was\r\nspent. In Queen Victoria's Park there were crowds of people waiting to\r\nsee the Duke and Duchess, but only a few minutes' glance at the Falls\r\nwas taken. A visit to Loretto Convent followed with songs from the\r\npupils and luncheon afterwards. Archbishop O'Connor of Toronto assisted\r\nin the reception. The rest of the day was spent in viewing and admiring\r\nthe ever-changing glories of Niagara Falls, and the return took place in\r\nthe evening. On the 14th of October Hamilton was visited and three hours\r\nspent in receiving one of the most enthusiastic welcomes of the whole\r\ntour. Thousands had gathered in the spacious grounds surrounding the\r\nstation and in the streets, and the cheering was hearty and continuous.\r\nThe usual address was presented by Mayor J. S. Hendrie at the City Hall.\r\nThe Royal visitors then lunched at \"Holmstead,\" the residence of Mr.\r\nWilliam Hendrie, and afterwards the Duke presented new colours to the\r\n13th Regiment. The departure took place amidst the cheers of thousands.\r\n\r\nAt St. Catharines there was a short stop and the whole city turned out,\r\nbusiness was suspended and the colleges and schools attended in a body.\r\nThere was a guard of honour at the station, cheers from eight thousand\r\nthroats, a beautiful bouquet presented to the Duchess and a few citizens\r\nintroduced by Mayor McIntyre. Brantford had its station handsomely\r\ndecorated, and three thousand children massed on the platform to sing\r\npatriotic songs as the train rolled in. Another bouquet for the Duchess\r\nwas presented and also a casket containing a silver long-distance\r\ntelephone from Professor Bell, the father of its inventor, who was born\r\nin Brantford. Their Royal Highnesses here signed the Bible which was\r\ngiven in 1712 by Queen Anne to the Mohawk Church of the Six Nations and\r\nwhich already contained the autographs of the King and the Duke of\r\nConnaught. A very brief stop was made at Paris, where the school\r\nchildren were gathered and a large crowd cheered the Royal couple. At\r\nWoodstock the whole population turned out and the train entered the\r\nstation amid the cheers of ten thousand people. Mayor Mearns presented\r\nsome of the citizens and his little daughter handed a beautiful bouquet\r\nof roses to the Duchess. A thousand school children waved flags and sang\r\nthe National Anthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM WESTERN TO EASTERN ONTARIO\r\n\r\nFrom the West to the East travelled the Royal train during the night,\r\nand on the morning of October 15th reached Belleville, where some eight\r\nthousand people had assembled to welcome the Duke and Duchess.\r\nPresentations by Mayor Graham, a guard of honour, cheers and a bouquet\r\nfor the Duchess, with singing school children, were the familiar\r\nfeatures of the reception. An address from 250 deaf and dumb children\r\nwas, however, an interesting exception. At Kingston the Royal couple\r\ndrove through the crowded and decorated streets to a pavilion in front\r\nof the City Hall, where three thousand children sang, cheered and waved\r\nflags, while flowers were given to the Duchess and several addresses\r\npresented to the Duke. Following this ceremony the Royal procession\r\npassed on through the historic city to Queen's University where his\r\nRoyal Highness was given an honorary LL.D. and presented with an address\r\nby the Chancellor, Sir Sandford Fleming. In replying to the latter the\r\nDuke expressed the regret of himself and the Duchess at the absence\r\nthrough illness of the Very Rev. Principal Grant. He then laid the\r\ncorner-stone of a new building donated to the University by the citizens\r\nof Kingston. There was tremendous cheering from the students and gay\r\ndecorations along the route which was then taken to the Royal Military\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nAt the College the Royal visitors witnessed a march past and gymnastic\r\ndisplay from the Cadets. A spontaneous and unexpected incident occurred\r\nin the private visit of Their Royal Highnesses to Principal Grant at the\r\nGeneral Hospital. They talked with him a few minutes and then the Duke\r\npersonally conferred upon him the C.M.G. which had been recently granted\r\nby the King. About one o'clock the Royal party reached the wharf where\r\nthey embarked on the steamer _Kingston_, which had been most elaborately\r\ndecorated and fitted up for the occasion, and started for a trip through\r\nthe Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence. At six o'clock the steamer\r\narrived at Brockville, and the Duke and Duchess were greeted with a\r\nbrilliant display of fireworks from the shore. At the landing-place they\r\nwere met by Mayor Buell, Senator Fulford and other prominent citizens. A\r\nbouquet was given the Duchess and the procession from the wharf to the\r\nstation passed through cheering people and the departure was made in a\r\nblaze of fireworks. At Cornwall, which was reached on the morning of\r\nOctober 16th, there were some four thousand people at the station, and\r\nMayor Campbell presented the Duke and Duchess with a complete set of\r\nlacrosse sticks for the Royal children. They were enclosed in a\r\ngold-mounted case. The next stoppage was at Cardinal, where thousands\r\nhad assembled from the same surrounding country and the school children\r\nsang national songs.\r\n\r\nOn the way from Ontario to the Provinces by the Atlantic a pause was\r\nmade at Montreal on October 16th to visit the Victoria Jubilee Bridge--a\r\nreconstruction of the one into which His Majesty the King had driven the\r\nlast rivet when visiting Canada in 1860. The Duke of Cornwall and York\r\nwas now presented with a gold rivet by Mr. George B. Reeve, General\r\nManager of the Grand Trunk Railway system, as a souvenir of that event\r\nand of his present visit. The Bridge, which was called one of the\r\nwonders of the world at the time of its construction, now had a double\r\ntrack and double roadway. During the afternoon half-an-hour was spent at\r\nSherbrooke, where the station was gaily decorated. Mayor Worthington\r\npresented the address and during his reply the Royal speaker declared\r\nthat \"among the many pleasant experiences of our delightful visit to\r\nCanada one will remain most deeply graven in our memories--the solemn\r\ndeclaration of personal attachment to my dear father, the King, and of\r\nloyalty to the throne of our glorious Empire.\" A beautiful bear-skin was\r\nthen presented to the Duchess by Mrs. Worthington on behalf of the\r\nladies of Sherbrooke. Some South African veterans were decorated with\r\nthe medal and a delegation from the Caughnawaga Indians received.\r\n\r\nFrom Sherbrooke the Royal party then travelled straight through to St.\r\nJohn, New Brunswick, which they reached in the afternoon of October\r\n17th. After they had arrived and the echoes of the roaring guns had died\r\naway the Royal procession was formed and passed through the usually\r\ncrowded and decorated streets to the Exhibition Buildings where Mayor\r\nDaniel, in his official robes, welcomed the Duke and Duchess and\r\npresented an address from the City as did Mayor Crocket from Fredricton.\r\nSome nine other local addresses were also presented and replied to. His\r\nRoyal Highness then presented colours to British Veterans from\r\nMassachusetts. There was to have been a review of troops in the\r\nafternoon but, owing to some mistake in the arrangements, a Royal\r\npresentation of South African medals, of colours to the 62nd Battalion,\r\nand of a sword of honour to Captain F. Caverhill Jones, comprised the\r\nproceedings. The return from the Exhibition grounds to Caverhill Hall,\r\nwhich had been specially fitted up by the Provincial Government for the\r\nvisitors, was through crowds of more or less enthusiastic people. In the\r\nevening there were fireworks and electrical displays and a Reception at\r\nthe Exhibition Building attended by a large representation of New\r\nBrunswick society. Late in the afternoon a deputation of ladies waited\r\nupon Her Royal Highness and presented her with a beautiful mink and\r\nermine muff on behalf of the women of St. John. At noon on the following\r\nday the Duke and Duchess left the city amid much cheering and the\r\nfarewells of a representative gathering at the station. On the way to\r\nHalifax the City of Moncton, N. B., celebrated the arrival of the Royal\r\ntourists with a half holiday, a decorated station and a mass of cheering\r\npeople. Mayor Atkinson presented a number of prominent people and the\r\nDuchess received a couple of handsome bouquets. At Dorchester, as the\r\ntrain arrived it passed through a gaily decorated station, cheering\r\ncrowds and local officials ranged along the platform. At Amherst, N. S.,\r\na short stop was made.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM NEW BRUNSWICK INTO NOVA SCOTIA\r\n\r\nWhen Halifax was reached, on the morning of October 19th, the reception\r\nwas beautiful and impressive as well as loyal. Thousands of soldiers\r\nwith glittering bayonets lined the streets, together with hundreds of\r\nsailors armed with cutlasses and rifles, and many thousands of crowding\r\nand cheering citizens. As the Royal visitors arrived at the station they\r\nwere welcomed with a roar of guns from the magnificent citadel heights\r\nand defences of Halifax and from the vessels of the most formidable\r\nfleet of war-ships which, it was said, had ever graced a Canadian port.\r\nThey were received by the Vice-regal party, Vice-Admiral Sir Frederick\r\nBedford and his staff, Colonel Biscoe and his staff, Lieutenant-Governor\r\nthe Hon. A. G. Jones, of Nova Scotia, Lieutenant-Governor P. E. McIntyre\r\nof Prince Edward Island, the Hon. G. H. Murray and the members of his\r\nGovernment, Mayor Hamilton of Halifax, the Mayor of Charlottetown and\r\nvarious other officials and representative men. At the platform in front\r\nof the station various addresses were presented amid cheers from an\r\nimmense gathering. The Duke, in replying, did so separately to the\r\nPrince Edward Island welcome and to that from Nova Scotia. To the former\r\nhe expressed the \"true regret\" which they felt at not being able to\r\nvisit that well-remembered Province, and to the latter he made a really\r\neloquent response. \"It is perhaps fitting that we should take leave of\r\nCanada in the Province that was the first over which the British flag\r\nwaved, a Province so full of moving, checquered, historic memories, and\r\nthat, embarking from your capital which stands unrivalled amongst the\r\nnaval ports of the world, we should pass through waters that are\r\ncelebrated in the annals of our glorious Navy.\" He also spoke of the\r\n\"affectionate sympathy\" with which they had been received throughout the\r\nDominion.\r\n\r\nFollowing this function the Royal couple passed through streets lined\r\nwith troops and sailors and cheering crowds and at times presenting the\r\nappearance of a net-work of colour, a canopy of bunting. In the grounds\r\nof the Provincial Building His Royal Highness laid the foundation-stone\r\nof a monument erected by the Government and people of Nova Scotia in\r\nhonour of the Provincial heroes who had fallen in South Africa. The\r\nprocession then passed on to a handsome arch, guarded by a detachment of\r\nRoyal Engineers, where the Duke inspected the members of the British\r\nVeterans' Society who were drawn up on parade. Conspicuous amongst them\r\nwas a negro holder of the V.C. Thence the parade continued to the\r\nDockyard where the Royal couple went on board the _Ophir_, which had\r\ncome up from Quebec during the long inland tour. In the afternoon a\r\ngreat review and massing of many thousands of soldiers and sailors,\r\ninfantry, cavalry and artillery, was held on the Halifax Common in the\r\npresence of a crowd of spectators--probably twenty-five thousand in\r\nnumber. The troops were under the supreme command of Colonel Biscoe, and\r\nthe Royal Naval Brigade included four thousand sailors from twelve of\r\nBritain's most modern cruisers. It was a sight such as had never been\r\nwitnessed in Canada before and the review eclipsed in effect the\r\nprevious military spectacle at Toronto; while the environment of great\r\nfortifications and a harbour full of war-ships enhanced the character of\r\nthe scene. Near the Royal pavilion was a stand containing six thousand\r\nschool children who sang patriotic songs.\r\n\r\nAfter the review the Duke presented colours to the 66th Princess Louise\r\nFusiliers and was informed by the Lieutenant-Governor that H.R.H. the\r\nDuke of Kent had conferred a similar honour upon the Regiment in the\r\nearly part of the preceeding century. His Royal Highness then handed the\r\nwar medals to the South African veterans and presented a sword of honour\r\nto Major H. B. Stairs. In the evening a state dinner was given by the\r\nLieut.-Governor at Government House when occasion was taken by the Duke\r\nto present the Hon. Dr. Borden with the medal won by the gallant son who\r\nhad lost his life in South Africa. A Reception was held afterwards in\r\nthe Provincial Buildings amid scenes of striking beauty and brightness.\r\nThe city and fleet were brilliantly illuminated and the spectacle one of\r\nthe most beautiful of the whole Canadian tour. The next day was Sunday\r\nand was spent very quietly on board the _Ophir_. At night the Duke dined\r\nwith Vice-Admiral Bedford on board his flag-ship. On the following\r\nmorning the Royal visitors left the shores of Canada in their yacht,\r\naccompanied by the fleet of battleships and with the cheers of many\r\nthousands of people, the roar of guns and the sound of bands playing on\r\nsea and shores, echoing out over the waters of the harbour.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL FAREWELL TO CANADA\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Halifax, and under date of October 19th, the Duke of\r\nCornwall and York sent a communication to the Earl of Minto expressive\r\nof the regret felt by the Duchess and himself at bidding farewell to \"a\r\npeople who by their warm-heartedness and cordiality have made us feel at\r\nhome amongst them from the first moment of our arrival on their shores.\"\r\nHe referred to the loyal demeanour of the crowds, the general\r\nmanifestations of rejoicing and the trouble and ingenuity displayed in\r\nthe illuminations and street decorations. They were specially touched by\r\nthe great efforts made in small and remote places to manifest feelings\r\nof kindness toward them. \"I recognize all this as a proof of the strong\r\npersonal loyalty to the throne as well as the deep-seated devotion of\r\nthe people of Canada to that unity of the Empire of which the Crown is\r\nthe symbol.\" Thanks were tendered to the Dominion Government, the\r\nProvincial authorities and municipal bodies and to various individuals\r\nfor the care and trouble bestowed upon the varied arrangements. Of the\r\nMilitia His Royal Highness spoke in high terms. The reviews at Quebec,\r\nToronto and Halifax had enabled him to judge of the military capacity of\r\nthe Dominion and of the \"splendid material\" at its disposal. Their\r\nhearts, he added, were full at leaving Canada and their regrets extreme\r\nat having to decline so many kind invitations from different centres.\r\n\"But we have seen enough to carry away imperishable memories of\r\naffectionate and loyal hearts, frank and independent natures, prosperous\r\nand progressive communities, boundless productive territories, glorious\r\nscenery, stupendous works of nature, a people and a country proud of\r\nits membership in the Empire and in which the Empire finds one of its\r\nbrightest offspring.\"\r\n\r\nOn the way home Newfoundland was visited and an enthusiastic reception\r\ngiven by the people of St. John's and the Government of the Island. The\r\nusual addresses, decorations and functions followed and then the _Ophir_\r\nsteamed away over the last stretch of ocean in this long, strenuous and\r\nmemorable Royal progress of over fifty thousand miles on sea and land.\r\nWhen in sight of English shores again the King and Queen and the Royal\r\nchildren, accompanied by the Channel squadron of thirteen warships, met\r\nthe travellers and escorted them to Portsmouth. After eight months of\r\nseparation the Royal family of three generations were again together.\r\nThe popular welcome at Portsmouth was brilliant and enthusiastic as well\r\nit might be. As the _Times_ put it on November 1st--the day of the\r\narrival home--\"The Duke and Duchess have made the greatest tour in\r\nhistory; they have accomplished an act of high statesmanship without\r\nstatecraft but by simple arts which are better than any statecraft; they\r\nhave been under many skies and seen many strange, lovely and impressive\r\nsights; they have been greeted and acclaimed by many peoples, races and\r\nlanguages.\" In his speech to the Civic deputation waiting upon him on\r\nthe following day His Royal Highness stated that their journey had\r\ncovered thirty-three thousand miles by sea and twelve thousand five\r\nhundred by land. \"Everywhere we have been profoundly impressed by the\r\nkindness, affection and enthusiasm extended to us and the universal\r\ndeclarations of loyalty to the Throne; and by the conscious pride in\r\nmembership of our great Empire which has constantly displayed itself.\"\r\n\r\nA dinner was given by the King and Queen on board the yacht _Victoria\r\nand Albert_ in honour of the Royal travellers' return and, in the course\r\nof a speech of welcome, His Majesty referred to the cordiality and\r\nloyal enthusiasm of their reception everywhere. \"The accounts of their\r\nreceptions, regularly transmitted to me by telegrams and letters and\r\namply confirmed in my conversations to-day, have touched me deeply and I\r\ntrust that the practical result will be to draw closer the strong ties\r\nof mutual affection which bind together the old Motherland with her\r\nnumerous and thriving offspring\". The special train was then taken to\r\nLondon and from Victoria station to Marlborough House the Royal couple\r\ndrove through numerous crowds of cheering people and gaily decorated\r\nstreets, with little Prince Edward beside them--for the first time\r\nmaking a public appearance and accepting the acclamations of the public\r\nwith becoming gravity. It was a triumphal ending to a triumphant\r\nprogress. A sort of climax to this termination was afforded, however, in\r\nthe great banquet given by the Lord Mayor of London at the Guild Hall on\r\nDecember 5th, to him who had been created Prince of Wales on the 9th of\r\nNovember preceding by his father the King. There were only four\r\ntoasts--the King, proposed by Sir Joseph Dimsdale, the Lord Mayor and\r\nchairman; Queen Alexandra and the Royal family, responded to by the new\r\nPrince of Wales; the Colonies, proposed by the Earl of Rosebery and\r\nresponded to by Mr. Chamberlain; the Lord Mayor and Corporation proposed\r\nby the Marquess of Salisbury.\r\n\r\nBesides the speakers and the members of the Royal suite during this\r\nfamous tour there were present the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, Mrs.\r\nChamberlain, Lord James of Hereford, Mr. John Morley, Lord Knutsford,\r\nLord and Lady Tweedmouth, Lord and Lady Lamington, Lord Brassey, Lord\r\nAvebury, Sir Frederick Young and many other interesting or important\r\npersonages. The speech delivered by the Prince of Wales was one which\r\nstartled England from its directness of statement and its eloquence of\r\nstyle and delivery. It was not merely a clear, or good description of\r\nthe tour; it was the utterance of one who was both statesman and\r\norator. His Royal Highness referred to the historic title which he now\r\nbore, to the voyage, unique in character and rich in experience, to the\r\nloyalty, affection and enthusiasm of the greetings everywhere, to the\r\nspecial characteristics of the visit in each country. He analysed\r\nColonial loyalty as being accompanied by \"unmistakable evidences of the\r\nconsciousness of strength; of a true and living membership in the\r\nEmpire; and of power and readiness to share the burden and\r\nresponsibility of that membership\". He spoke of the influence of Queen\r\nVictoria's life and memory, of the qualities of the sixty thousand\r\ntroops whom he had reviewed, of the openings for better commercial\r\ninterchange. \"I venture to allude to the impressions which seemed\r\ngenerally to prevail among our brethren across the seas that the Old\r\nCountry must wake up if she intends to maintain her old position of\r\npre-eminence in her Colonial trade against foreign competitors\". The\r\nneed of more population in the Colonies was referred to and an urgent\r\nappeal made to encourage the sending out of suitable emigrants. \"By this\r\nmeans we may still further strengthen, or at all events, pass on\r\nunimpaired, that pride of race, that unity of sentiment and purpose,\r\nthat feeling of common loyalty and obligation which knit together and\r\nalone can maintain the integrity of our Empire\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nThe King and the South African War\r\n\r\n\r\nNo event in many years has created such keen interest amongst, and been\r\nso closely followed by, the Royal family of Great Britain as the war in\r\nSouth Africa. Apart from Queen Victoria's natural and life-long dislike\r\nof the horrors of war, there was the earnest sympathy which she felt in\r\nthe last two years of her reign with thousands of her subjects who had\r\nsuffered in the loss of husband, or brother, or father, or friend; and\r\nthe womanly sorrow which she herself felt for the many promising young\r\nofficers whom she had personally known or liked, or whose relations and\r\nfriends had been upon terms of intimacy with members of the Royal\r\ncircle. The matter was still more brought home to her, in a personal\r\nsense, by the death of her grandson, Prince Christian Victor, who, after\r\nmonths of hard campaigning and with the reputation of an able, modest\r\nand hard-working officer, succumbed in the autumn of 1900 to enteric\r\nfever, and was buried, at his own request, upon the South African veldt.\r\nBut these personal considerations had never been so potent with the\r\nQueen as had her broader sympathies for her people, and there can be no\r\ndoubt the gloomy days of Colenso and Spion Kop told severely upon the\r\nsensibilities of a Sovereign who was as proud of the nation's position\r\nand as keen to feel national humiliation, or sorrow, as was the humblest\r\nand most loyal of her subjects. And the fact that her duty to the people\r\nand the Empire lay in supporting her Ministers and pressing, if\r\nnecessary, for a still more vigorous prosecution of the struggle, could\r\nnot but have its effect upon the constitution of a Queen who felt her\r\nresponsibilities very keenly and who was an aged woman as well as a\r\ngreat ruler.\r\n\r\nWhere she could help in keeping behind her Ministers a united people\r\nQueen Victoria did her utmost. Early in March, 1900, the Royal\r\nrecognition of Irish valour in South Africa, shown in the order to the\r\nsoldiers of the Empire to wear the Shamrock on St. Patrick's day, was as\r\ntactful and wise a step as statesmanship ever initiated. The ensuing\r\npostponement of Her Majesty's spring visit to sunny Italy and her\r\nprolonged stay in Dublin during the month of April were pronounced\r\nappeals to Irish loyalty. Her Christmas present of chocolate to the\r\ntroops in the field, her ever-thoughtful telegrams, and occasional\r\nletters and speeches upon public occasions, were also of great value to\r\nthe cause of national unity and action in differing degrees. Meantime,\r\nthe Duke of Connaught had volunteered early in the period of trouble\r\nwhich eventually developed into war, but the Queen did not wish him to\r\ngo to the front and, though he had offered to waive his rank and\r\nseniority in order to do so, his mother's wishes, of course, prevailed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE HEIR APPARENT\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales was exceedingly active during this period in paying\r\nevery possible compliment to departing troops, in welcoming home the\r\nveterans of the war, in conferring medals and in helping the many\r\ncharities, hospital interests and military organizations which the\r\nsituation evoked. As soon as the war broke out the Princess of Wales had\r\ncommenced to organize a hospital ship for the care of the wounded at\r\nCape Town and, on November 22d, 1899, Her Royal Highness visited the\r\nvessel prior to its departure. She was accompanied by the Prince with\r\nPrincess Victoria, the Duchess of York and the Duke and Duchess of Fife.\r\nBadges and gifts were presented to the nursing sisters and the men of\r\nthe Royal Army Medical Corps and St. John Ambulance Brigade and a brief\r\nspeech delivered by the Prince. To this object, it may be added, the\r\nPrincess had given £1000, and a Committee formed by her and composed of\r\nLady Lansdowne, Lady Wolseley, Lady Wantage, Sir Donald Currie and\r\nothers, had raised the large additional sum required. At Windsor, on\r\nDecember 15th, the Prince of Wales, accompanied by his wife, the Duke of\r\nCambridge and Prince Christian, presented to the Grenadier Guards the\r\nmedals they had won in the Soudan. On January 26th, 1900, he reviewed\r\nsix hundred officers and men of the Imperial Yeomanry under command of\r\nColonel, Lord Chesham. He thanked them for making him their Hon.\r\nColonel, and then added: \"You have all, like true men, volunteered for\r\nactive service to do your duty to your Sovereign and your country. I\r\nfeel sure that when you leave your homes and country you will feel that\r\na great duty devolves on you--to maintain the honour of the British\r\nflag--and that you will ably assist the Regular forces of Her Majesty\r\nabroad and do credit to your country and your corps.\"\r\n\r\nA little later, on February 9th, another contingent of Yeomanry, under\r\nColonel Mitford, were inspected by the Prince ere they departed for\r\nSouth Africa. \"Most heartily\" he said to them, \"do I hope that the\r\nservices you intend to render your Sovereign and your country will bring\r\ncredit upon yourselves. I feel sure that, under your commanders, you\r\nwill know that one of the first principles is good discipline. Then, I\r\nhope you are good shots and good riders.\" In the afternoon, at\r\nDevonshire House, His Royal Highness received the one hundred and fifty\r\nnurses and men connected with the Imperial Yeomanry Hospital. When the\r\nPrincess of Wales' Hospital Ship returned with its sorrowful burdens of\r\nwounded men the Prince and Princess were the first to visit it and do\r\nwhat was possible by kind thought and word and action to soothe the\r\nsuffering of the soldiers. Netley Hospital they visited again and\r\nagain, and more than one Canadian or Australian, or other Colonial\r\nsoldier of the Queen, will always speak of the gracious personal\r\nkindness of the Royal couple.\r\n\r\nWhen the Naval Brigade returned in triumph from its achievements at\r\nLadysmith there was added to the seething, cheering, enthusiastic\r\npopular welcome the formal reception and inspection by the Heir\r\nApparent, accompanied by the Princess and other members of the Royal\r\nfamily and the Lords of the Admiralty. After brief speeches from Mr.\r\nGoschen and His Royal Highness the former, as First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, entertained the officers of the Brigade and the Prince of\r\nWales at luncheon. On November 2nd, following, the Prince presided at a\r\ngreat banquet given in London to the officers and men of the Honourable\r\nArtillery Company and the City Imperial Volunteers. Colonel Mackinnon of\r\nthe latter force sat on the right of the Royal chairman and the Lord\r\nMayor on the left. In his speeches the Prince gave a brief history of\r\nthe origin and the war achievements of the Artillery and the City\r\nImperial Volunteers, congratulated many of the officers by name, spoke\r\nof the opportunity they had been given of taking part in \"a great and\r\nimportant war and of maintaining the honour of the British flag,\" and\r\nreferred in pathetic terms to the death of Prince Christian Victor--who\r\nhad been through five campaigns and was under thirty-four years of age.\r\n\r\nWhen the Composite Regiment of the Household Cavalry went to war in\r\nNovember 1899 they had been inspected by the Heir Apparent. Upon their\r\nreturn, December 3rd 1900, he paid them the same compliment, accompanied\r\nby various members of the Royal family and leading officers of the Army.\r\nHe expressed pride at being Colonel-in-Chief of a corps which had so\r\ngreatly distinguished itself--in the distant past as well as the near\r\npresent. Following them came the Royal Canadian Regiment, commanded by\r\nColonel W. D. Otter. To them the Prince made a neat and patriotic\r\nspeech. \"I am well aware of what you have gone through and the splendid\r\nway in which you have served in South Africa and I deeply regret and\r\nmourn with you the loss of so many brave men.\" Ever anxious, like the\r\nQueen and her own husband, to promote the well-being of the soldiers and\r\nsailors the Princess of Wales had acted since the beginning of the war\r\nas President of the Soldiers and Sailors' Families Association and, on\r\nDecember 31st, 1900, reported through the press that £500,000 had been\r\ndirectly subscribed to their purposes, £190,000 given through the\r\nMansion House subscription, and £50,000 through a special Lord Mayor's\r\nFund. The whole of this sum had now been expended in caring for the\r\nwives and families of those at the front and distributed through the\r\nvoluntary services of eleven hundred ladies and gentlemen throughout the\r\nUnited Kingdom. At least £50,000 was still being expended monthly and\r\nHer Royal Highness made and personally signed an earnest appeal for the\r\nfurther funds required.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Roberts left to take command in South Africa, the Prince of\r\nWales personally saw him off at the station--accompanied by the Duke of\r\nConnaught, who had been again praying the Military authorities to allow\r\nhim to go to the front in the new crisis which had arisen and who had\r\neven obtained Lord Roberts' approval to his taking a place upon his\r\nStaff. But the War Office would only say that with so many general\r\nofficers out of the country His Royal Highness could do better service\r\nby remaining with the Army at home.\r\n\r\nThere were many reasons for the Prince of Wales taking a keen interest\r\nin the war apart altogether from the natural and patriotic reason. A\r\npeculiarly large number of the sons of personal friends were at the\r\nfront and many of them were fated to fall from time to time. The\r\nreputation of the officers engaged in the struggle was necessarily very\r\ndear to him. He knew them all and had many associations with their\r\nregiments and themselves. A blow to Sir George White, a disaster to Sir\r\nRedvers Buller, a danger to Col. Baden Powell, a threatened illness in\r\nthe case of Lord Roberts, were all matters of personal concern to him as\r\nwell as of national or patriotic interest. The central figure in the\r\nbeginning of the war--the great personality of Mr. Cecil Rhodes--had\r\nlong been a friend and had been received by the Prince upon a kindly\r\nsocial footing. Through the Duke of Fife's connection with the South\r\nAfrican Chartered Company, the Prince must have been closely interested\r\nin all the earlier developments of the struggle and it could only have\r\nbeen by special permission that his son-in-law held a Director's place\r\nup to the actual outbreak of the war. Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Milner\r\nwere both men who had been closely associated with his own Imperialistic\r\nprojects and ideals and there can be little doubt--though it was never\r\npublicly expressed--that the Prince of Wales sympathised with the policy\r\nwhich has since made South African expansion and empire possible.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales had seen Lord Roberts off upon his career of\r\nsuccessful action; on January 3rd, 1901, accompanied by the Princess,\r\nthe Duke and Duchess of York and the Duke of Connaught, he welcomed him\r\nhome and on behalf of the Queen received him as a Royal guest at\r\nBuckingham Palace. A magnificent banquet followed, given by the Prince,\r\nin honour of the Field Marshal--who had just been created an Earl and a\r\nKnight of the Garter--and six months later as King of Great Britain, he\r\nwas able to send a special message to Parliament recommending a grant to\r\nEarl Roberts of £100,000. Shortly after this reception came the\r\nmuch-mourned death of the Queen and the accession of His Royal Highness\r\nto the Throne. It was not long before the King was showing his\r\nappreciation of South African soldiers by inspecting or addressing them\r\nbefore their departure, or upon their return. On February 15th,\r\naccompanied by Queen Alexandra, the Duke and Duchess of Connaught, the\r\nDuke of Cambridge, Princess Louise, the Duchess of Argyll, the Duke of\r\nArgyll, Lord Roberts, Sir Redvers Buller, Lord Strathcona and Mr.\r\nChamberlain, he inspected Lord Strathcona's Regiment of Horse and\r\npresented a King's colour to Colonel Steele. His Majesty's speech to the\r\nofficers and men was tactful and gracious: \"I welcome you here on our\r\nshores on your return from active service in South Africa. I know it\r\nwould have been the urgent wish of my beloved mother, our revered Queen,\r\nto have welcomed you also. That was not to be; but be assured she deeply\r\nappreciated the services you rendered as I do. It has given me great\r\nsatisfaction to inspect you to-day, to have presented you with your\r\nwar-medals and also with the King's colour. I feel sure that in\r\nentrusting this colour to you, Colonel Steele, and to those under you,\r\nyou will always defend it and will do your duty as you have done in the\r\npast year in South Africa and will do it on all future occasions. I am\r\nglad that Lord Strathcona is here to-day, as it is owing to him that\r\nthis magnificent force has been equipped and sent out.\" The King then\r\npresented Colonel Steele, personally with the M.V.O. decoration.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL INTEREST IN THE WAR\r\n\r\nFollowing this and other similar events came the re-organization of the\r\nArmy, in which the King no doubt took a great deal of interest though it\r\nwould only be shown the form of advice or expressions of opinion. By Mr.\r\nSt. John Brodrick's scheme, as outlined on March 9th, and ultimately\r\naccepted in the main, it was decided to have the military forces so\r\norganized that three Army corps could be sent abroad at any time; that\r\nthe artillery and mounted troops should be increased and the medical and\r\ntransport service reformed; that officers should be better trained, with\r\nless barrack-square drill and more musketry, scouting and\r\nindividuality. It was proposed also to \"decentralize administration,\r\ncentralize responsibility;\" to increase the Militia from 100,000 to\r\n115,000, to increase the pay of the soldiers, to utilize the Yeomanry\r\nand to affiliate, if possible, the Colonial forces. The new arrangements\r\nwould provide, it was hoped, a home force of 155,000 Regulars, 90,000\r\nReserves, 150,000 Militia, 35,000 Yeomanry and 250,000 Volunteers--a\r\ntotal of 680,000 men.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, peace negotiations had been progressing. On February 28th a\r\nlong interview took place between Lord Kitchener and General Louis Botha\r\nwho, according to the British general's despatch, \"showed very good\r\nfeeling and seemed anxious to bring about peace.\" The question of\r\ngovernment, grading from a Crown Colony system up to full\r\nself-government, was discussed; the licensing of rifles for protection\r\nand hunting; the use of English and Dutch languages; the enfranchising\r\nof Kaffirs; the protection of Church and trust funds and the guarantee\r\nof legal debts and notes of the late Republics; the question of a\r\nwar-tax on the farms and the time of return of prisoners of war;\r\npecuniary assistance to the burghers, so as to enable them to start\r\nafresh; the question of amnesty and the proposal to disfranchise Cape\r\nrebels; were all freely discussed. After considerable interchange\r\nbetween Lord Kitchener and Mr. Brodrick and Lord Milner and Mr.\r\nChamberlain, a definite statement of terms was offered General Botha and\r\nby letter, dated March 16th, declined. The details of this cabled\r\ncorrespondence and the proposed terms were, of course, submitted to the\r\nKing and approved by His Majesty, and it is certain that had the war\r\nthen ended the Coronation would have taken place at an earlier date than\r\nwas afterwards fixed.\r\n\r\nThe question of honours conferred by the Crown in peace or war has\r\nalways been one of considerable discussion in Colonial, if not in home\r\ncircles. How far the Sovereign acts in this connection with, or without\r\nthe advice of responsible Ministers, cannot be exactly known. The action\r\nis unquestionably guided by circumstances based primarily upon the\r\nadmitted fact that all honours and titles, constitutionally as well as\r\ntheoretically, lie in the hands of the Sovereign. It is probable that\r\nthe recommendations made are generally accepted; that the name of any\r\none known to be disapproved of by the King would never be submitted;\r\nthat the slightest hint of disapproval would suffice for any name to be\r\nat once dropped; that any suggestion made by the Sovereign is at once\r\nincluded in the official list as a matter of course; that the interest\r\ntaken by the Sovereign in the honours bestowed depends somewhat upon\r\nwhether they are conferred in the ordinary way for routine services or\r\ngranted for special reasons of action or state; that Colonial honours\r\nare seldom changed as they come from the hands of the Governor-General\r\nor Viceroy.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it may be reasonably assumed that King Edward took\r\nmore interest in this subject than did the late Queen. His many years of\r\nactive association with public life and men of all classes and political\r\nopinion had made him keenly and impartially aware of personal claims and\r\nmerits and more than usually able to judge amongst the great numbers who\r\ndesire or deserve Royal recognition from time to time. His Majesty's\r\nfirst Honour List dealt with services in the South African War under\r\nterms of a multitudinous catalogue submitted by F. M. Lord Roberts up to\r\nNovember 29th, 1900. Amongst those who were made Knights Commander of\r\nthe Bath, or K.C.B. were Lieut.-General Charles Tucker,\r\nLieutenant-General Lord Methuen, Major-General Reginald Pole-Carew,\r\nMajor-Generals W. G. Knox and H. J. T. Hildyard, Lieut.-General Ian S.\r\nM. Hamilton, Major-General Hector A. Macdonald, Lieut.-General J. D. P.\r\nFrench, Brigadier-Generals Henry S. Settle, Edward Y. Brabant and J. G.\r\nDartnell--all well-known officers in the South African conflict. The\r\nGrand Cross of St. Michael and St. George, or G.C.M.G. was conferred\r\nupon General Sir Redvers Buller, Lieut.-General Lord Kitchener,\r\nLieut.-General Sir Frederick Forestier-Walker and General Sir George\r\nWhite. The K.C.M.G., or Knight Commandership in the same Order, was\r\ngiven to Major-General Sir C. F. Clery, Major-General Sir Leslie Rundle,\r\nMajor-General E. T. H. Hutton, Lieut.-Colonel E. P. C. Girouard and\r\nothers. A number of minor honours were bestowed upon British, Canadian,\r\nAustralian, New Zealand and South African officers and men and an\r\nInvestiture of various Orders was held at St. James's Palace on June\r\n3rd, 1901. In such a list much discrimination was necessary and it is\r\nprobable that the tact and knowledge of the King would have a very\r\ncontrolling influence apart altogether from his constitutional rights\r\nand powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS CEREMONIES AND INCIDENTS\r\n\r\nOn May 24th, His Majesty helped to make the welcome home to Sir Alfred\r\nMilner splendid and impressive and worthy of the statesman who had\r\ntoiled amidst personal danger and depressive surroundings, public\r\ndisasters and continuous misrepresentation, to maintain British rights\r\nand justice in South Africa. The High Commissioner was received at the\r\nstation by Lord Salisbury, Mr. Chamberlain, Lord Roberts, Lord\r\nLansdowne, Mr. Balfour and many others. Thence he was driven to\r\nBuckingham Palace and received by the King in a prolonged and private\r\naudience. The honour of a peerage was conferred upon him and on the\r\nfollowing day Lord Milner was entertained at a large luncheon given by\r\nthe Colonial Secretary and Mrs. Chamberlain and attended by the most\r\neminent public men of the Metropolis--outside of the Liberal party\r\nranks. On the same day the King presented colours to the Third Scots\r\nGuards.\r\n\r\nOn June 13th a most imposing ceremony was held by His Majesty on the\r\nHorse Guards Parade when thirty-two hundred officers and men from South\r\nAfrica were presented with war medals by the King amid scenes which had\r\nnot been duplicated since the memorable function when the late Queen\r\nVictoria and the Crimean soldiers had been the central figures. The\r\nRoyal platform was covered with crimson cloth and in its centre was\r\nspread a beautiful Persian silk carpet above which a canopy of crimson\r\nand gold, supported on silver poles, had been erected. Around the\r\nplatform was a bewildering display of splendid uniforms and, after the\r\narrival of the King and Queen Alexandra, accompanied by Princess\r\nVictoria, the distribution of the medals lasted over two\r\nhours--Major-General Sir Henry Trotter handing them to His Majesty who,\r\nin turn, presented them to the officer or soldier as he filed past. The\r\nfirst recipients were Lord Roberts, Lord Milner and Sir Ian Hamilton. A\r\nmost brilliant and successful function concluded with cheers and the\r\nNational Anthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RIGHT HON. HERBERT HENRY ASQUITH.

THE EARL GREY, P.C., G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O.\r\n  The King's Representative in Canada, 1904-10]\r\n\r\nThe war now dragged on its weary way. Victories and occasional defeats\r\nmarked the stages of attrition by which the bravery and obstinacy of a\r\ndetermined foe was gradually worn down. On August 16th, 1901, Lord\r\nKitchener issued his proclamation banishing all Boer leaders taken in\r\narms after September 15th: three days later the Duke of Cornwall landed\r\nat Cape Town; on August 27th Lord Milner returned to take up his arduous\r\nduties. Mr. Cecil Rhodes died on March 26th, 1902, and on April 9th Boer\r\ndelegates met at Klerksdorp under safe conducts from Lord Kitchener, and\r\nthere Mr. Steyn, General Delary and General De Wet, and others,\r\nconferred upon the possibilities of peace. Three days later they\r\nproceeded to Pretoria and were given every facility for discussion and\r\nconsultation by the British authorities. On April 18th they temporarily\r\ndispersed to consult their Commandos after being given the terms and\r\nconcessions which it was decided to grant. There were supposed to be, at\r\nthe most liberal computation--London _Times_ of April 25th--some 10,000\r\nBoers in the field at this time, while the women, children and Boer\r\nresidents of the refugee camps, who were being fed and cared for by the\r\nauthorities, numbered 110,000.\r\n\r\nThe keenest interest had been taken by the King in the course of the war\r\nduring this period and in the negotiations which ensued. He had been\r\nhoping for its termination before his Coronation and, some months prior\r\nto this, on January 15th, had addressed a re-inforcement of the\r\nGrenadier Guards in rather sanguine terms: \"I trust that the duties you\r\nwill be called upon to perform will be less arduous than those of some\r\nof the men who have gone before you and that the war will shortly be\r\nbrought to a close. But, whatever duties you may be called upon to\r\nperform, I am sure you will fulfil them efficiently and will keep up the\r\nold spirit and traditions for which the Guards are famous.\" His wishes,\r\nlike so many entertained throughout the Empire, were not speedily\r\nrealized, but it is safe to say that His Majesty would no more have\r\nunduly hurried the course of negotiations or changed their effective and\r\nfinal character in order to attain his natural desire for a peaceful\r\ncelebration of the Coronation--as was asserted in some sensational\r\nquarters--than he would have cut his own hand off.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes forgotten that the King not only embodies the authority\r\nof his vast realm in his position, but must concentrate in his own\r\nperson a natural strength of pride in his Empire so great as to be far\r\nbeyond the possibility of a reflection upon its patriotism. He would\r\nhardly be human in his qualities if the most intense patriotic pride in\r\nthe unity and power of his realms was not the first and strongest\r\ninstinct of his nature. But this in passing. Lord Salisbury illustrated\r\nthe attitude of both the Sovereign and his Ministers when speaking at\r\nthe Albert Hall, London, on May 7th, during the pending negotiations: \"I\r\nonly wish to guard against misapprehension which I think I have seen, to\r\nthe effect that the willingness we have shown to listen to all that may\r\nbe said to us is a proof that we have retreated or receded from our\r\nformer position and are willing to recognize that the rights we claimed\r\nare no longer valid. There is no ground for such an assertion. We cannot\r\nafford after such terrible sacrifice, not only of treasure but of men,\r\nafter the exertions, unexampled in our history, that we have made--we\r\ncannot afford to submit to the idea that we are to allow things to slide\r\nback into a position where it will be in the power of our enemy again,\r\nwhen the opportunity suits him and the chance is favourable to him, to\r\nrenew again the issue that we have fought this last three years.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMINATION OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the negotiations were proceeding. At first the Boer delegates\r\nproposed that the two Republics should merely concede what had been\r\ndemanded before the outbreak of the war. When this was refused, even as\r\na matter for consideration, and they were referred to previous\r\nstatements as to terms, the request was made that some of the leaders be\r\nallowed to consult their friends in Europe, or at least to have one of\r\nthe European refugee leaders come over and assist them in their\r\ndecision. To this Lord Kitchener gave an instant veto, and intimated\r\nthat unless their proposals were to be serious the negotiations had\r\nbetter drop. Then they asked for an armistice in order to consult the\r\nburghers in the field, but Lord Kitchener would not stop military\r\noperations a moment further than to allow the delegates to hold meetings\r\nof their Commandos. But in that event they were to return to Pretoria\r\narmed with full powers to conclude peace--if they returned at all. As a\r\nresult of this decision the leading officers of the Boer forces met\r\ntheir respective Commandos, and delegates were duly appointed to a total\r\nnumber of one hundred and fifty. These met on May 16th at Vereeniging\r\nand spent a couple of weeks in discussion, in obtaining absolutely final\r\nterms for acceptance or rejection from the British authorities, and in\r\npresenting these again to the Commandos. The opponents of peace during\r\nthese preliminaries were generally believed to include Mr. Steyn and\r\nCommandants Wessels, Muller, Celliers and Herzog, while Generals Delarey\r\nand De Wet were in favour of accepting the British terms. Finally, on\r\nMay 31st, the conditions of surrender were signed. Mr. Steyn was the\r\nonly important absentee from the final conferences at Pretoria.\r\n\r\nThus ended a war in which Great Britain had spent £200,000,000, raised\r\nand equipped some three hundred thousand men, of whom one-sixth were\r\nColonial troops, and performed the unparalleled feat of supplying quick\r\nand satisfactory transport and subsistence for this great body of troops\r\nto a distance of seven thousand miles from the seat of Government. The\r\npeople had never wavered, the Government had, apparently, never\r\nhesitated, the credit of the country had not been affected, even the\r\nprosperity of Great Britain had not been touched. Speaking of the\r\nconduct of the people in this connection the _Times_ of July 2d paid the\r\nfollowing personal tribute: \"A splendid example of patriotism and\r\ndevotion was set them by our late Sovereign Lady, and they nobly\r\nfollowed it. It is worth recalling now that, while she deplored the\r\nnecessity of war, she never wavered to the end in her conviction that it\r\nmust be fought through. It is to her, perhaps, above all others, that we\r\nowe the calm dignity of temper with which the peoples of her Empire have\r\npassed through the greatest ordeal they have been called upon to undergo\r\nsince the days of Napoleon. Her son, King Edward, has inherited her\r\nspirit and kept before his subjects the ideals she held up to them.\"\r\n\r\nThe terms of peace included the promise by Great Britain of\r\nself-government in gradual stages and \"as soon as circumstances will\r\npermit\"; the exemption of burghers from civil or criminal proceedings in\r\nconnection with the war (with certain specified exceptions); the\r\nrecognition of English as the official language, and the promise that\r\nDutch should be taught in the schools when desired; the granting of\r\narms, under license, to the burghers and the postponement of native\r\nfranchise questions until the period of free government had arrived; the\r\ngrant of £3,000,000 to be expended by Commissioners in the work of\r\nrepatriation and the supply of shelter, seed, stock, etc., to the\r\nreturning burghers; and the reference of rebels to their own Colonial\r\nCourts for trial, with the proviso that the death penalty should not in\r\nany case be inflicted.\r\n\r\nThe settlement was well received by the burghers, of whom fully twenty\r\nthousand came in and gave up their arms in the course of a week or two.\r\nMany of the Commandos fraternized with the British troops and joined\r\nthem in singing \"God Save the King.\" As soon as the decision for peace\r\nhad been ratified Lord Kitchener paid a visit to Vereeniging and\r\naddressed the assembled Boer leaders. He congratulated them upon the\r\nsplendid fight they had made. \"If he had been one of them himself he\r\nwould have been proud to have done as they had done. He welcomed them as\r\ncitizens of a great Empire and hoped they would do their duty to the\r\nSovereign as loyally as they had to the old State.\" Messrs.\r\nSchalk-Burger and Louis Botha had, meanwhile, written farewell letters\r\nto the burghers which concluded by asking them to be obedient and\r\nrespectful to their new Government.\r\n\r\nImmediately on receipt of the information that peace had been signed\r\nKing Edward issued the following message: \"The King has received the\r\nwelcome news of the cessation of hostilities in South Africa with\r\ninfinite satisfaction, and trusts that peace may be speedily followed by\r\nthe restoration of prosperity in his new dominions, and that the\r\nfeelings necessarily engendered by war will give place to the earnest\r\nco-operation of all His Majesty's South African subjects in promoting\r\nthe welfare of their common country.\" At the same time His Majesty\r\ncabled Lord Milner: \"I am overjoyed at the news of the surrender of the\r\nBoer forces and I warmly congratulate you on the able manner in which\r\nyou have conducted the negotiations.\" A similar despatch went to Lord\r\nKitchener, with hearty congratulations on the termination of\r\nhostilities: \"I also most heartily congratulate my brave troops under\r\nyour command for having brought this long and difficult campaign to so\r\nglorious and successful a conclusion.\" The King also announced that he\r\nhad created Lord Kitchener a Viscount and promoted him to be full\r\nGeneral. Following the public announcement of peace on Sunday, June 1st,\r\ncame a flood of congratulatory telegrams to the King from public bodies\r\nand private individuals, and celebrations were held all over the United\r\nKingdom and the British Empire.\r\n\r\nOn June 8th, by order of the King, a special thanksgiving service was\r\nheld in St. Paul's Cathedral and His Majesty attended in person\r\naccompanied by Queen Alexandra, Princess Victoria, the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales, Prince and Princess Charles of Denmark, the Duke and\r\nDuchess of Connaught, the veteran Duke of Cambridge, and other members\r\nof the Royal family. A great gathering of representative Britons was\r\npresent in the crowded Cathedral, including most of the members of the\r\nHouses of Lords and Commons and the Corporation of London. Amongst many\r\nother notabilities were the Duke and Duchess of Argyll, Mr. Balfour, the\r\nEarl of Rosebery, the Marquess of Lansdowne, Earl and Countess Roberts,\r\nEarl and Countess Carrington, Lady Macdonald of Earnscliffe, Sir Redvers\r\nand Lady Audrey Buller. A short and eloquent sermon was preached by\r\nBishop Winnington-Ingram, of London, in which he referred to the\r\nblessings of peace for the people and the completion of the causes for\r\nrejoicing at the approaching Coronation. Meanwhile, on June 4th, the\r\nKing had followed up the honours already conferred on Lord Kitchener by\r\nsending a special message to the House of Commons at the hands of Mr. A.\r\nJ. Balfour, the Government Leader, to the following effect: \"His\r\nMajesty taking into consideration the eminent services rendered by Lord\r\nKitchener and being desirous, in recognition of such services, to confer\r\non him some signal mark of his favour, recommends that he, the King,\r\nshould be enabled to grant Lord Kitchener £50,000.\" The vote was carried\r\nby a majority of three hundred and eighty-two to forty-two and marked\r\nthe final stage in the war--its prolonged struggles, its negotiations,\r\nits honours and its rewards. To the King this result was the one thing\r\nneedful and seemed to leave a fair field, a peaceful Empire, a loyal\r\npeople, waiting without a shadow on the sun to share in the splendid\r\ncelebration of his approaching Coronation. To the Lord Mayor and\r\nCorporation of London and the London County Council His Majesty\r\naddressed, on June 13th, some words in reply to their expressions of\r\nloyalty and congratulation at the conclusion of peace, which may\r\nappropriately be quoted here:\r\n\r\n     \"I heartily join in your expression of thankfulness to Almighty God\r\n     at the termination of a struggle which, while it has entailed on my\r\n     people at home and beyond the seas so many sacrifices, borne with\r\n     admirable fortitude, has secured a result which will give increased\r\n     unity and strength to my Empire. The cordial and spontaneous\r\n     exertions of all parts of my dominions, as well as of your ancient\r\n     and loyal city, have done much to bring about this happy result.\"\r\n\r\n     \"You give fitting expression to the admiration universally felt for\r\n     the valour and endurance of the officers and men who have been\r\n     engaged in fighting their country's battles. They have been opposed\r\n     by a brave and determined people, and have had to encounter\r\n     unexampled difficulties. These difficulties have been cheerfully\r\n     overcome by steady and persistent effort, and those who were our\r\n     opponents will now, I rejoice to think, become our friends. It is\r\n     my earnest hope that, by mutual co-operation and good-will, the\r\n     bitter feelings of the past may speedily be replaced by ties of\r\n     loyalty and friendship and that an era of peace and prosperity may\r\n     be in store for South Africa.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nArrangements for the Coronation\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the Coronation of the King were of a character\r\nwhich eclipsed anything in the history of the world. It was\r\nunquestionably his aim and intention to make the event an illustration\r\nof the power of the British Empire, the loyalty of its people and the\r\nunity of its complex races. The pride of the King in his great position,\r\nthe knowledge which he had acquired of the Empire in his innumerable\r\ntravels, the statecraft which he had inherited and developed, were all\r\nfactors in the determination to make this occasion memorable. Connected\r\nwith the splendour of the event, as planned, was the personal\r\nrelationship and friendship of most of the Sovereigns of Europe with and\r\nfor His Majesty and, associated with every detail of its anticipated\r\nsuccess, was the enthusiastic loyalty of Indian Princes and great\r\nself-governing British dominions beyond the seas. Finally, the end of\r\nthe South African War came as if to add the one thing wanting to the\r\nentire success of the most magnificent Coronation in all history.\r\nPreparations went on apace from the beginning of Spring, 1902. The mere\r\nmaterial evidences of the coming event transformed busy and commercial\r\nLondon into a forest of boards and poles and platforms. Westminster\r\nAbbey was changed inside and out and a special entrance was made for the\r\nKing and Queen Alexandra to enter through, and so made as to harmonize\r\nwith the general architecture and character of the building.\r\n\r\nA thousand great beacon lights were built over the United Kingdom so\r\nthat from shore to shore the news of the crowning of the King might be\r\nflashed in flames of light to the people. In London and other centres\r\nevery kind of device for electrical display and illumination was\r\nprepared and, toward the middle of June, flags and bunting in myriad\r\nforms began to show themselves. In other parts of the Empire almost\r\nevery city and town and village arranged for some kind of demonstration.\r\nBanquets and garden parties and band concerts and processions and\r\nmilitary reviews and all the varied means by which the English-speaking\r\nperson expresses his feelings were in full tide of preparation as the\r\ntime of the Coronation grew near. India had its own unique and Oriental\r\nmodes of expressing loyalty and the feeling there was enhanced by the\r\nnews that the new Prince of Wales was going to repeat the state visit of\r\nhis father, the King, in December of this year and see the people of\r\npractically the only part of the British realms which he had not yet\r\nvisited. South Africa was to celebrate peace and loyalty at the same\r\ntime and the great centres of Australia were not behind the rest of the\r\nEmpire despite the existing gloom of draughts and sheep famine.\r\n\r\nThe guests invited to attend the great function might be divided into\r\ntwo classes--those who came to a common centre for the celebration of\r\ntheir Sovereign's crowning, for the presentation of a picture of\r\nImperial unity, and for the discussion of questions incident to the\r\nwide-spread dominions of the King; and those who came from foreign\r\nnations as a tribute to the position of Great Britain in the world and\r\nas a token of their friendship for its people as well as their respect\r\nfor its ruler. In the first list the first place may be given to India\r\nbecause of the element of gorgeousness and Oriental pomp which its\r\nrepresentatives were to bring to the function. Calcutta was to be\r\nrepresented by Maharajah Kumar Tagore; Bombay by Sir Jamsetjee\r\nJeejeebhoy, the scion of a series of great merchants; Madras by Rajah\r\nSir Savalai Ramaswami Mudaliyar; Bengal and the Presidencies of Bombay\r\nand Madras by distinguished gentlemen of long names and varied titles;\r\nthe United Provinces of Agra and Oudh by the Hon. N. M. D. F. Ali Khan,\r\nwho had served in both the Provincial and Supreme Councils, and by Rajah\r\nPertab Singh; the Punjab sent two representatives of whom Sir Harnman\r\nSingh Ahluwalia belonged to the Viceroy's Legislative Council and\r\nrepresented indirectly the native Christians; the Central Provinces,\r\nAssam, Burmah and the new North-West Frontier Province also appointed\r\nrepresentatives. Other guests from India included the Sultan Muhammad\r\nAgha Khan of the Khoga Community.\r\n\r\nThe special Royal guests from the Colonies were General Sir Francis W.\r\nGrenfell, representing Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus; Sir Joseph West\r\nRidgeway, representing Fiji and various Eastern Colonies and\r\nProtectorates; Sir Walter J. Sendall, for the West Indies, Bermudas,\r\nBritish Honduras and the Falkland Islands; Sir William MacGregor,\r\nrepresenting the West African Colonies and Protectorates; the Right Hon.\r\nSir Wilfrid Laurier, Prime Minister, representing the Dominion of\r\nCanada; the Right Hon. Edmund Barton, Prime Minister, representing the\r\nCommonwealth of Australia; the Right Hon. Richard J. Sedden, Prime\r\nMinister, representing New Zealand; the Right Hon. Sir J. Gordon Sprigg,\r\nPrime Minister, representing Cape Colony; Sir Albert H. Hime, Prime\r\nMinister, representing Natal; and Sir Robert Bond, Prime Minister,\r\nrepresenting Newfoundland. Other British guests were His Highness the\r\nSultan of Perak and Lewanika, Chief of the Barotzes, in Africa. There\r\nwere many invitations accepted outside of the list of special names\r\nmentioned who were privileged as the King's guests and as such were to\r\nbe put up in state at the Hotel Cecil and be provided with Royal\r\ncarriages and servants and escorts. Governors of various minor Colonies\r\nand dependencies; Native Princes of India apart from the official\r\nrepresentatives of its Cities and Provinces; Premiers of Australian\r\nStates and Canadian Provinces; were all invited to be present and many\r\nof them came to grace the occasion. Amongst those from Canada who\r\naccepted the invitation and were in London, with the others already\r\nreferred to, as the day for the ceremony approached, were the Hon. G. W.\r\nRoss, Premier of Ontario, the Hon. H. T. Duffy, representing the Premier\r\nof Quebec, the Hon. R. P. Roblin, Premier of Manitoba, the Hon. James\r\nDunsmuir Premier of British Columbia, the Hon. L. J. Tweedie, Premier of\r\nNew Brunswick and the Hon. G. H. Murray, Premier of Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nEvery foreign country or state of importance had its official\r\nrepresentative appointed and they poured into London and were received\r\nwith varying degrees of state and ceremony as the eventful day\r\napproached. Prominent amongst them were the Hon. Whitelaw Reid, special\r\nAmbassador from the United States and, in an unofficial capacity,\r\nSenator Chauncey M. Depew. From Russia came the Grand Duke Michael, Heir\r\nPresumptive to the Throne; from Italy His Royal Highness the Duke\r\nd'Aosta; from Greece the Crown Prince and Heir to the Throne; from\r\nBulgaria, the reigning Prince Ferdinand I.; from Belgium, Prince Albert\r\nof Flanders; from Germany, Prince Henry of Prussia; from Denmark the\r\nCrown Prince Frederick, Heir to the Throne; from Roumania the Crown\r\nPrince; from Austria the Arch-duke Francis Ferdinand, Heir Presumptive;\r\nfrom France, Admiral Gervais, special Ambassador; from Rome, Mgr. Merry\r\ndel Val; from Abyssinia, Ras Makonnen, the victorious general and\r\nspecial envoy of the Emperor Menelik; from Bavaria, Prince Leopold; from\r\nSweden and Norway the Crown Prince; from Portugal, the Crown Prince.\r\n\r\nOther foreign representatives were Duke Albert of Würtemberg, Prince\r\nWaldemar of Denmark, General Dubois of France, Field Marshal Count Von\r\nWaldersee and Admiral Von Koeter of Germany, Prince George, Prince\r\nNicholas and Prince Andrew of Greece, the Grand Duke of\r\nMecklenburg-Strelitz, Prince Danilo of Montenegro, the Duke of\r\nSaxe-Coburg and Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg, Prince George of\r\nSaxony, the Prince of the Asturias from Spain, Prince Chen of China,\r\nPrince Mohamed Ali of Egypt, Prince Akihito Komatsu of Japan, Prince Yo\r\nChai-Kak of Korea, Baron de Stein of Liberia, the Prince of Monaco, the\r\nCrown Prince of Siam and special Ministers from Luxemburg, the\r\nNetherlands, Turkey, Honduras, Mexico, Morocco, Nicaragua, Persia,\r\nServia and Uruguay.\r\n\r\nSoldiers of the King from all parts of the Empire were present in\r\nEngland for the occasion. The Indian troops, quartered at Hampton Court,\r\nnumbered nine hundred strong and represented every phase of the military\r\nand native life of Hindostan. Sikhs, Dogras, Jats, Pathans, Mohammedans\r\nfrom the Punjaub, the Deccan and Madras, Mahrattas, Rajpoots, Garwhal's,\r\nGurkhas, Afridis, Tamils, Moplahs, Hazaras and Beloochis, were each\r\nrepresented in uniforms of their local regiments. Scarlet, yellow, blue,\r\ngrey, green and red, were some of the colours to be seen. At the\r\nAlexandra Palace were soldiers from a great variety of countries. Canada\r\nsent six hundred and fifty-six men, representative of all its regiments,\r\nunder command of Lieut.-Colonel H. M. Pellatt and Lieut.-Colonel R. E.\r\nW. Turner V.C., D.S.O.; Australia sent one hundred and forty men under\r\nColonel St. Clair Cameron C.B.; New Zealand seventy-nine men under\r\nColonel Porter; Cape Colony one hundred and fifty under Major-General\r\nSir Edward Y. Brabant; Natal, ninety-nine under Lieut.-Colonel E. M.\r\nGreene; Rhodesia twenty-six, Ceylon fifty-four, Malta forty-six, and\r\nCyprus fourteen men. Native contingents included variously coloured and\r\nclad soldiers from the Gold Coast of Africa, Nigeria, Sierra Leone,\r\nLagos, British Central Africa, British East Africa, Uganda, Somaliland,\r\nStraits Settlements, Bermuda, British Borneo, the West Indies, Fiji,\r\nHong-Kong and Wei-hai-Wei. The Colonial troops, with their interesting\r\nwar record, their varied and striking uniforms, their varieties of race\r\nand colour and country, their differences of physique and appearance,\r\nwere not the least remarkable of the Empire contributions to a great\r\nfunction. The Duke of Connaught was in command of all the Forces for the\r\noccasion and with him were associated Lord Roberts, Lord Wolseley, Sir\r\nFrancis Grenfell, Sir William Butler, Major-General W. H. Mackinnon, Sir\r\nEdward Brabant and other officers connected with the late war. Colonel\r\nand Maharajah Sir Pertab Singh represented India on this Staff and\r\nLieutenant-General Sir Archibald Hunter was in immediate command of the\r\nColonial Contingents.\r\n\r\nVarious Foreign regiments were to be represented including the 1st\r\nPrussian Dragoons of Germany, the 12th Hussars of Austria, the Guard\r\nHussars of Denmark and the forces of Russia and Portugal. All the great\r\nBritish regiments were to be included, either in the procession as\r\ncavalry, or along the route as infantry. Preparations for the great\r\nNaval Review were elaborate. The Channel, Home and Cruiser squadrons\r\nwere to be in attendance with Admiral Sir Charles Hotham as\r\nCommander-in-Chief. Besides a number of Foreign warships, which were\r\nspecially sent to participate in the function, the British battle-ships\r\nnumbered twenty-one, the cruisers twenty-six, the torpedo gun-boats\r\nseventeen, the torpedo boat destroyers twenty-eight and the sea-going\r\ntraining vessels ten. Amongst the Foreign contributors to the Review\r\nwere Germany, the United States, Russia, Sweden and Norway, Denmark,\r\nGreece, France, Japan, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, Chili,\r\nAustro-Hungary and the Argentine.\r\n\r\nAll the complex arrangement of the details in connection with these and\r\nother elements of the Coronation festivities were in the hands of an\r\nExecutive Committee appointed on June 28th, 1901, at a meeting of the\r\nKing and his Privy Council and attended by most of the members of the\r\nCabinet, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Dukes of Norfolk,\r\nPortland and Fife, the Earls of Rosebery, Selborne and Carrington, Earl\r\nRoberts, Earl Spencer, Lord Alverstone, Sir W. V. Harcourt, and Sir\r\nHenry Campbell-Bannerman. Amongst the members of this Executive of\r\nfifteen were the Duke of Norfolk (chairman) Lord Esher, the Bishop of\r\nWinchester, Lord Farquhar, Mr. Schomberg K. McDonnell, Colonel Sir\r\nEdward Bradford, Sir Francis Knollys, Sir Edward W. Hamilton, Colonel\r\nSir E. W. D. Ward, Major-General Sir Arthur Ellis and Rear-Admiral W. H.\r\nFawkes. Later on Sir Montagu Ommanney, Sir William Lee-Warner, Sir\r\nKenelm Digby, Lieut.-General Kelly-Kenny, and others, were added. Their\r\nwork was, of course, closely overlooked by the King who was in constant\r\ncommunication with the Duke of Norfolk and Sir Francis Knollys. The\r\nfollowing programme of leading events was finally announced as approved\r\nby His Majesty:\r\n\r\n     June 23 State Dinner at Buckingham Palace.\r\n\r\n     June 24 The King and Queen to receive Foreign Envoys and\r\n     Deputations.

At\r\nPortsmouth arrangements were made for a banquet in the Drill-hall, on\r\nJune 26th, to one thousand men from the Foreign war-ships, with five\r\nhundred British seamen and marines as hosts. On the following day there\r\nwere to be athletic sports for the sailors and a garden party by the\r\nMayor and Mayoress for the officers of the fleets and distinguished\r\nvisitors. Following the Review, on June 28th, arrangements were made for\r\na garden party at Whale Island, for an Admiralty ball in the Town-Hall,\r\nfor a luncheon to the officers, a Civic entertainment to the men and a\r\nball given by the Mayor and Mayoress. In London a Coronation bazaar, in\r\naid of the Sick Children's Hospital, was announced with various stalls\r\nin charge of Princess Henry of Pless, the Duchess of Westminster, Lady\r\nTweedmouth, Mrs. Harmsworth, the Countess of Bective, Mrs. Choate, the\r\nDuchess of Somerset and Countess Carrington. The King's Dinner to the\r\nPoor of London was planned upon an enormous scale and His Majesty stated\r\nthat he would spend £30,000 in thus entertaining half-a-million of his\r\npoorer subjects. Sir Thomas Lipton, who had been in charge of a smaller\r\naffair at the Diamond Jubilee, was given control of the details. Similar\r\npreparations, upon a minor scale of course, were going on all over the\r\nEmpire and in New York a Coronation Ode was issued by Mr. Bliss\r\nCarman--a Canadian by birth--which did the subject noble justice and\r\ncommenced with the following verse:\r\n\r\n    \"There are joy-bells over England, there are flags in London town;\r\n    There is bunting on the Channel where the fleets go up and down;\r\n    There are bon-fires alight\r\n    In the pageant of the night;\r\n    There are bands that blare for splendour and guns that speak for might;\r\n    For another King of England is coming to the Crown.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a Colonial Conference had also been arranged to take place\r\nduring these weeks of celebration and the delegates were to be special\r\nRoyal guests for the Coronation--Sir Francis W. Grenfell, Sir Wilfrid\r\nLaurier, Mr. Seddon, Mr. Barton, Sir W. J. Sendall, Sir William\r\nMacGregor, Sir Gordon Sprigg, Sir Albert Hime, Sir Robert Bond, and Sir\r\nWest Ridgeway--together with Mr. Chamberlain and the Earl of Onslow,\r\nUnder-Secretary of the Colonies. The official programme, published a few\r\ndays before the date set for the Coronation, gave the details of the\r\nRoyal procession on that and the following days. On June 26th, in\r\npassing from Buckingham Abbey, there were to be eight carriages\r\ncontaining the Royal visitors and members of the Royal family, the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales and then the state coach with the King and\r\nQueen--having the Duke of Connaught riding to its right and a\r\nconsiderable staff and brilliant escort of Life Guards behind.\r\n\r\nThe procession of the following day was to be essentially an Imperial\r\npageant and was to pass over a popular city route. The Colonial portion\r\ncame first on the programme, headed by Lieut.-General Sir A. Hunter, and\r\nwith detachments of Canadian artillery and cavalry and Australian\r\ncavalry preceding a carriage containing Sir Wilfrid and Lady Laurier and\r\nMr. and Mrs. Barton. Then followed carriages with Sir R. Bond and Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Seddon, Sir Gordon and Miss Sprigg, Sir Albert and Miss Hime,\r\nSir W. Ridgeway and Sir F. Grenfell, Sir W. Sendall, and Sir W.\r\nMacGregor, the Sultan of Perak and King Lewanika--each preceded or\r\nfollowed by detachments of New Zealand, Cape, Natal, Ceylon, Trinidad,\r\nCyprus and other Colonial cavalry, in accordance with the country\r\nrepresented. Then was to come the Indian portion of the procession\r\nincluding varied detachments of Native cavalry, and with carriages\r\ncontaining the Maharajahs of Jaipur, Kolapore and Bikanur. Following\r\nthese was to be a long line of British artillery and Aids-de-Camp to the\r\nKing, representing the Volunteers, Yeomanry, Militia and Regular forces\r\nand the Marines. The Head-Quarters staff came next, then Field Marshals\r\nin the Army, Foreign naval and military attachés, deputations of Foreign\r\nofficers, then Indian Aides-de-Camp to the King--the Maharajahs of\r\nGwalior, Gooch and Idur--and several members of the Royal family on\r\nhorseback. Then came thirteen carriages containing Royal visitors,\r\nspecial Ambassadors and members of the Royal family, followed by special\r\nescorts of Colonial and Indian troops and Royal Horse Guards. The King\r\nand Queen were to come next, in a splendid state coach drawn by eight\r\nhorses, with the Duke of Connaught riding on one side of them and the\r\nPrince of Wales on the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RIGHT HON.

On May 30th His Majesty\r\npresented colours to the Irish Guards, received the Maharajah Sir Pertab\r\nSingh, held an investiture of the Garter in great state, visited\r\nWestminster Abbey to see the Coronation preparations, and gave a large\r\ndinner party. During the next three days he presented medals to the St.\r\nJohn Ambulance Brigade and held a Levée and investiture of the Bath. On\r\nJune 4th he gave audiences to various Ministers, proceeded with the\r\nQueen to the Derby, gave a dinner to the Jockey Club and then joined the\r\nQueen at the Duchess of Devonshire's dance. On June 6th the King\r\nreceived the Indian Princes at Buckingham Palace and afterwards, with\r\nQueen Alexandra, held a stately Court function. Two days later the King\r\nand Royal family attended a service of thanksgiving for peace at St.\r\nPaul's Cathedral. Other incidents followed and on June 14th His Majesty,\r\naccompanied by Queen Alexandra, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the\r\nDuke and Duchess of Connaught, Princess Victoria and Princess Margaret,\r\nof Connaught, visited Aldershot to inspect the forty thousand troops\r\nwhich had been slowly gathering there for weeks. A stormy and wet day\r\nchanged to brightness as the Royal party arrived and the town was found\r\nto be prettily decorated and filled with enthusiastic people. A great\r\nTattoo was held in the evening with massed bands and myriad\r\ntorch-lights, but with not very pleasant weather.\r\n\r\nOn the following day it was announced in the _Times_ that the King could\r\nnot attend church owing to a slight attack of lumbago caused by a chill\r\ncontracted the night before. Queen Alexandra attended the service,\r\nhowever, and in the afternoon visited several charitable institutions.\r\nMonday the 16th saw His Majesty still too much indisposed to take his\r\npart in reviewing the troops and this function was fulfilled by the\r\nQueen, accompanied by the Prince and Princess of Wales. In the afternoon\r\nthe King and Queen returned to Windsor and in the evening His Majesty\r\nwas able to be present at a dinner party in the Castle. On the following\r\nday the _Times_ expressed editorial pleasure at the King's apparent\r\nrecovery but urged caution and suggested that, despite the\r\ndisappointment of the people, it might be better if Ascot were not\r\nvisited by him on that day and the next but a substantial rest taken\r\ninstead. The same idea seemed to occur to the Royal physicians because\r\nnot only was the visit to Ascot cancelled but also a long-expected visit\r\nto Eton which had been arranged for June 21st.\r\n\r\nOther functions were postponed or cancelled and it was announced that\r\nHis Majesty was resting quietly and preparing himself for the essential\r\nand heavy functions of the Coronation week. Such was the apparent\r\nposition of affairs in connection with this great event as massed\r\nmyriads of people roamed the streets of London and the other and varied\r\nmillions of the British Empire threw themselves into the final stages of\r\npreparation. Such was the position on June 21st when the Toronto\r\n_Globe_, in a very fitting editorial, embodied the popular feeling of\r\nCanada. It declared that on the following Thursday the historic Abbey of\r\nWestminster and the streets of London would see \"the greatest ceremonial\r\nwhich our times have known\"; that no King \"ever ascended a throne with\r\nthe more universal consent of the governed than does Edward VII.\"; and\r\nthat the British people had never been fickle in their feelings toward\r\nhim who was once Prince of Wales and was now King. \"Their affection for\r\nhim has never faltered and they will feel gratified on Thursday that the\r\nconcluding ceremony of Coronation has fixed him firmly on the most\r\nglorious of earthly thrones\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nThe Illness of the King\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the almost fatal sickness of the Prince of Wales in 1871 was\r\nhistoric, from the sympathy it evoked and the influence it wielded, that\r\nof the King in June 1902 was infinitely more memorable. At the latter\r\nperiod the attention of the whole civilized world was focussed upon the\r\nfigure of the Sovereign who was about to be crowned amid scenes of\r\nunprecedented splendour; the press of the Empire and the United States\r\nwas filled with the record of his movements; the representatives of the\r\nCourts of Europe had arrived or were arriving; the Prime Ministers of a\r\ndozen countries and the Governors of many other countries of his\r\nfar-flung realm were in London; dense crowds were swarming through the\r\nstreets of the gaily-decorated metropolis; the approaching day was being\r\nlooked forward to by many millions of people in many lands as an\r\nevidence, in its successful splendour, of the power and prosperity of\r\nthe Empire. Three days before the 26th of June the King and Queen\r\nAlexandra had arrived in London from Windsor and the Coronation\r\nfestivities proper had commenced. His Majesty had looked well and had\r\nsmiled and bowed freely to the welcoming multitudes along the line of\r\nroute. Rumors of his having caught cold had prevailed, it is true, and\r\nin certain sensational quarters there had been statements as to serious\r\nillness and even allegations of paralysis.\r\n\r\nBut the evidence of that drive through the cheering streets of London\r\nwas deemed conclusive and during that afternoon and the next morning\r\nthe crowds increased and the excitement grew until sober-minded\r\nobservers who had seen the celebrations of the Queen's Jubilee and the\r\nDiamond Jubilee and knew something of the millions then gathered\r\ntogether were dismayed at the prospect of the massed multitudes of\r\nCoronation day. It was at 12.45 P.M. on June 24th, when the streets were\r\npacked with moving, happy, holiday crowds and the decorations were\r\nnearing completion and their full effect and force becoming apparent to\r\nthe on-lookers, that an official bulletin was posted at the Mansion\r\nHouse which seemed to reach every one in London at the same instant--so\r\nrapidly was the news spread. News that almost on the steps of the\r\nthrone, within a day of the mightiest festival ever designed by human\r\ngovernment and helped by a willing people, the King had been stricken\r\ndown! It appeared incredible. The people of England and of the Empire\r\nwere almost as dumb-founded as the masses on the streets of the\r\nMetropolis. But there was no way of getting beyond the simple words of\r\nthe bulletin signed by Lord Lister, Sir Thomas Smith, Sir Francis\r\nLaking, Sir Thomas Barlow and Sir Frederick Treves: \"The King is\r\nsuffering from perityphlitis. His condition on Saturday was so\r\nsatisfactory that it was hoped that with care His Majesty would be able\r\nto go through the ceremony. On Monday evening a recrudescence became\r\nmanifest rendering a surgical operation necessary to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe trouble approximated to the disease known in the United States and\r\nCanada as appendicitis and was of a character which made certainty as to\r\nrecovery quite impossible and left the widest scope for fears and\r\ndiscussion and speculation. It was analysed by Dr. Cyrus Edson, a\r\nwell-known New York physician, as follows: \"Perityphlitis is\r\ninflammation, including the formation of an abscess of the tissues\r\naround the vermiform appendix and hence it is very hard to distinguish\r\nfrom appendicitis. Usually an operation is necessary to ascertain\r\nwhether the appendix or the surrounding tissue is diseased.\" The King's\r\nphysicians gave the public all the information they wisely could. The\r\noperation was performed by Sir Frederick Treves, the most eminent living\r\nsurgeon in this connection, shortly after the first bulletin was issued\r\nand at six o'clock it was announced that \"His Majesty continues to make\r\nsatisfactory progress and has been much relieved by the operation.\" Five\r\nhours later the physicians stated that the King's condition was \"as good\r\nas could be expected after so serious an operation.\" It would be some\r\ndays, however, they added, before it would be possible to say he was out\r\nof danger. The doctors remained at Buckingham Palace all that night and\r\nbut little news crept out from the silence surrounding the great pile of\r\nbuildings to that stirring outer world which had grown so suddenly and\r\nstrangely quiet.\r\n\r\nFollowing the startling announcement of the King's illness came the\r\nnecessary statement that the Coronation ceremony was indefinitely\r\npostponed and the further intimation that the King himself had asked\r\nthat celebrations in the Provinces outside London might be continued. In\r\nLondon, he had specified his wish, before the operation took place, that\r\nthe dinner which was to be given to half-a-million of poor people should\r\nnot be postponed and His Majesty had expressed keen sorrow, not at what\r\nhe had already suffered himself or was likely to suffer, but at the\r\ndisappointment which his people would everywhere feel. Gradually it came\r\nout that for over a week he had been ill; that the pain had been very\r\ngreat at times; that the physicians had acceded to his determination to\r\ngo on with the ceremonies and the Coronation until longer delay in\r\noperation would have made the result fatal; that the King's one anxiety\r\nhad been not to disappoint the millions who would be in London and the\r\nmillions who would look on from abroad during the long-looked for event.\r\n\r\nThe story of the illness as it developed was made known by the _Lancet_\r\non June 27th. It seems that on Friday June 13th His Majesty had gone\r\nthrough a particularly arduous day and next morning was attended by Sir\r\nFrancis Laking who found him suffering from considerable abdominal\r\ndiscomfort. In the afternoon he felt better and went to Aldershot where\r\nthe unfortunately wet and cold weather at the Tattoo caused a distinct\r\nrevival of the trouble in the early morning accompanied by severe pain.\r\nSir F. Laking was sent for and in turn telegraphed Sir Thomas Barlow. On\r\nthe 15th, the Royal patient had a chilly fit but on Monday returned to\r\nWindsor and bore the journey well. Two days later he was seen by Sir\r\nFrederick Treves who found symptoms of perityphlitis. These, however,\r\ngradually disappeared and on Saturday, the 21st, His Majesty was\r\nbelieved to be on the road to rapid recovery and to be able to go\r\nthrough the Coronation ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday was uneventful. On Monday the King travelled from Windsor to\r\nLondon. Next day the necessity for an operation became clear.\" The\r\n_Lancet_ gave no reason for this sudden change in condition and it may\r\nhave been the excitement and strain of the drive through cheering masses\r\nof the London populace. \"At ten o'clock Tuesday morning (24th) the\r\nurgency of an operation was explained to His Majesty. Recognizing that\r\nhis ardent hope that the Coronation arrangements might not be upset must\r\nbe disappointed he cheerfully resigned himself to the inevitable. Before\r\nthe actual decision upon an operation was arrived at Sir Frederick\r\nTreves took the advice of two other sergeant-surgeons to the King, Lord\r\nLister and Sir Thomas Smith. They, as well as Sir Thomas Barlow and Sir\r\nFrancis Laking, came to the unanimous conclusion that no course but an\r\noperation was possible in all the circumstances. To delay would, in\r\nfact, be to allow His Majesty to risk his life.\" Such appears to have\r\nbeen the plain statement of this serious incident. Following the\r\noperation the course of the disease was steadily towards recovery and\r\nwithout serious complications of any kind. Danger at first there was and\r\nneither physicians, nor family, nor the public could feel anything like\r\nassurance of recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS TOWARDS RECOVERY\r\n\r\nThe London _Times_ went out of its way to warn the people against\r\nover-confidence in the result, and the bulletins were cautious in the\r\nextreme. On June 25th the King was said to have been very restless and\r\nwithout sleep during the early part of the night. He was, however, free\r\nfrom pain, and his five physicians declared that, under all the\r\ncircumstances, he might be described as \"progressing satisfactorily.\" On\r\nJune 26th they reported His Majesty's condition as satisfactory, his\r\nstrength as having been well maintained, and the wound as doing well.\r\nThe reports of June 27th showed a normal temperature, no disquieting\r\nsymptoms and, finally, a substantial improvement. On the next day the\r\nfive physicians issued the following bulletin: \"We are happy to be able\r\nto state that we consider His Majesty out of immediate danger. His\r\ngeneral condition is satisfactory. The operation wound, however, still\r\nneeds constant attention and such concern as attaches to His Majesty's\r\ncase is connected with the wound. Under the most favourable condition\r\nHis Majesty's recovery must of necessity be protracted.\" The bulletins\r\nthenceforward were regular in their statements of slow and steady\r\nimprovement. On July 2d it was announced that the wound was beginning to\r\nheal; then only daily reports were issued; and finally, on July 13th,\r\nthe Royal patient was taken by private train from Buckingham Palace to\r\nhis yacht at Portsmouth and, during the next few weeks, while it was\r\nanchored or quietly cruising off Cowes, the King was steadily growing\r\nstronger and better.\r\n\r\nThe bare details of an illness such as this can give no idea of the\r\nburden of apprehension which it entailed upon millions of people, the\r\nfinancial losses which it meant to thousands of merchants and others in\r\nall parts of the world, the dislocation of a political, social, and\r\ngeneral character which it involved in London, the consternation which\r\nit naturally caused in every centre in the Empire. The first effect of\r\nthe King's illness was to create a new tie of sympathy between himself\r\nand his subjects. Human suffering borne so patiently during that week of\r\nconcealed sickness and with such earnest determination to go through\r\nwhat must have come to appear the frightful ordeal of the Coronation\r\nappealed strongly to people everywhere in the Empire, while the\r\nexternally dramatic passage from preparations for the greatest of\r\nnational festivities down into the valley of the shadow of death came\r\nhome to the hearts of every one with peculiar force. This was\r\nparticularly apparent in Westminster Abbey where the last rehearsal of\r\nthe great Coronation choir, in the presence of the Bishop of London and\r\nunder the musical direction of Sir Frederick Bridge, was proceeding at\r\nnoon on June 24th. Suddenly, Lord Esher entered and told the sad news to\r\nthe Bishop, who, in a few words, turned the service of national\r\nrejoicing into one of solemn intercession. Everywhere there were similar\r\nservices and similar sudden changes. Coronation day, despite the King's\r\nkindly wish that demonstrations and functions outside of London should\r\nproceed, was turned into a season of special service and prayer in Great\r\nBritain and in the many other countries of the Empire.\r\n\r\nA pathetic service was held in St. Paul's Cathedral on the evening of\r\nthe announced illness, and the Bishop of Stepney spoke in most\r\nimpressive terms. \"As the days have passed, our thoughts and, I trust,\r\nour prayers have been centred in the King as he has moved to his\r\nCoronation watched by millions of eyes. Only yesterday we welcomed him\r\nto London with heartfelt joy. All around us is the glamour of\r\npreparation for a splendid festival. The very air is vivid with the glow\r\nof popular enthusiasm. From all parts of the earth our brethren have\r\ncome to rivet anew the links which bind them to our ancient Monarchy.\r\nAnd now come the tidings that this King is laid low with sickness and\r\nthat the great day has been postponed. We are bewildered. We cannot\r\nrealize, except in imagination, the dislocation of the life of a whole\r\nEmpire.\" Meanwhile, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York had asked\r\ntheir clergy to hold intercessory services on June 26th, and Cardinal\r\nVaughan, for his Church, had given similar orders. \"The finger of God,\"\r\nhe wrote to his clergy, \"has appeared in the midst of our national\r\nrejoicing and on the eve of what promised to be one of the most splendid\r\npageants in English history. This is in order to call the thoughts of\r\nall men to Himself. The King's life is in danger. Danger being imminent,\r\nlet us have immediate recourse to the Divine mercy and by public prayer\r\nseek His Majesty's recovery.\" The Chief Rabbi held special Jewish\r\nsupplications and the Chairman of the Congregational Union of England\r\nand Wales telegraphed to Sir Francis Knollys their hope that it might\r\nplease God to spare the King's valuable life so \"that he may rule for\r\nmany years over his devoted people.\"\r\n\r\nTelegrams of inquiry and sympathy poured into the Palace, the\r\nDepartments of the Government, and the Guildhall, for days after the\r\neventful incident of the operation. On the day that should have\r\nwitnessed the stately splendour of the Coronation, St. Paul's Cathedral\r\nwas the scene of a solemn service of intercession for the recovery of\r\nthe King. The Bishops of London and Stepney, the Archdeacon of London\r\nand Canons Holland and Newbolt were the officiating clergy and with them\r\nwere the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and a dozen other Bishops.\r\nThe Lord Mayor of London was present officially and the Duke of\r\nCambridge and Duke of Teck. So were the special missions of France,\r\nSpain, Germany, Mexico and other countries, the Hon. Whitelaw Reid and\r\nMr. Choate, the American Ambassador. Lord Selborne, Lord Cadogan and Mr.\r\nRitchie represented the Cabinet while the Premiers of Canada, Australia,\r\nCape Colony, Natal, New Zealand, Western Australia, and South Australia,\r\nwith the Sultan of Perak, the Rajah of Bobbili, Sir Jamesetjee\r\nJejeebhoy, and others represented the Colonial and Indian Empire. A\r\nlarge number of the leaders in the public, social and general life of\r\nthe country were also there. At the same time a similarly impressive\r\nservice was held in Margaret's, Westminster, the official church of the\r\nHouse of Commons, attended by the Lord Chancellor and Speaker, the Duke\r\nand Duchess of Devonshire, Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman, Lord and Lady\r\nLondonderry, and many members of both Houses of Parliament. A multitude\r\nof other churches held intercessory services at home and abroad on this\r\nday--notably, perhaps, one arranged by the National Council of Free\r\nChurches and held in the City Temple. Orders were given by the heads of\r\nall kinds of denominations in all kinds of countries to pray for the\r\nKing on the succeeding Sunday and, in most of the great Colonies of the\r\nCrown, that day was specially set apart for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPRESSIONS OF SYMPATHY\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the messages continued to pour in from Governments as well as\r\nindividuals or institutions. General Sir Neville Lyttelton for the Army\r\nin South Africa, Lord Hopetoun for the Government and people of\r\nAustralia, Sir Edmund Barton, the Premier of Australia, the Legislature\r\nof New South Wales, the Governors of the other Australian States and New\r\nZealand, the Governors of Fiji, Gambia, Cape Colony, Mauritius, Bermuda,\r\nNewfoundland, and Gibraltar, the Administrators of Sierra Leone,\r\nSeychelles, Ceylon, Hong-Kong and Wei-hai-Wei, the Governor of the\r\nStraits Settlements and the Premier of Natal sent despatches of\r\nsympathy and regret. In the United States much kindly feeling was\r\nexpressed. Papers such as the New York _Commercial-Advertizer_,\r\n_Tribune_ and _Post_ were more than kindly and generous in their\r\nregrets; others were merely sensational. The President hastened to cable\r\nan expression of the nation's sentiments and, at Harvard University on\r\nJune 25th, said: \"Let me speak for all Americans when I say that we\r\nwatch with the deepest concern and interest the sick-bed of the English\r\nKing and that all Americans, in tendering their hearty sympathy to the\r\npeople of Great Britain will now remember keenly the outburst of genuine\r\ngrief with which all England last fall greeted the calamity which befell\r\nus in the death of President McKinley.\" Prayers were also offered up for\r\nHis Majesty in the Senate and House of Representatives. Germany was\r\nlargely silent in its press but outspoken and warmly sympathetic in the\r\nperson of its Emperor. Austria was more than friendly and at Rome a\r\nResolution passed unanimously through both Houses expressing earnest\r\nwishes for \"the prompt recovery of the head of the State which has long\r\nbeen Italy's best friend.\" The French press was moderately sympathetic\r\nand dwelt upon King Edward's love of peace, while the leading Russian\r\nnewspapers paid tribute to the same elements in his character and laid\r\nstress upon his high qualities as a man and a Sovereign.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday following the serious stage in the King's illness the\r\nmetropolis was the scene of many special services. At Marlborough House\r\nChapel, Queen Alexandra, the Prince and Princess of Wales and other\r\nmembers of the Royal family were present in the morning, together with a\r\ncrowded gathering of members of the Court and old friends of His\r\nMajesty. Bishop Randall Davidson of Winchester preached a sermon of\r\neloquent retrospect--a picture of the events of the past few days and\r\nweeks. Almost from his seat on a great throne their Sovereign had passed\r\nto a hushed sick-room; during a crowded week the people had passed from\r\nbouyant expectancy to crushing disappointment, from loyal admiration of\r\na splendid occasion to personal sympathy with a stricken King. At the\r\nChapel Royal the Bishop of London preached and drew a lesson of humility\r\nfrom the tragic event, while in St. Paul's Cathedral the Bishop of\r\nStepney preached to an audience which included various Indian Chiefs and\r\nKing Lewanika of Barotze. Mgr. Merry del Val, the Papal Envoy to the\r\nCoronation, addressed a gathering at the Brompton Oratory attended by\r\nSir Wilfrid and Lady Laurier and Mr. Justice Girouard of Canada, Sir\r\nNicholas O'Conor, British Ambassador at Constantinople, Lord Edmund\r\nTalbot, Lord Walter Kerr, first Sea Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Howard\r\nGlossop and Lord Clifford of Chudleigh. The Reverend Bernard Vaughan, at\r\nthe Warwick Street Roman Catholic Church, dwelt upon the great loyalty\r\nof his people to the Throne and declared that much might and should be\r\ndone by Roman Catholics \"to build up and consolidate an Empire where\r\nevery man could breathe the air of freedom, claim his share of justice\r\nand practice his religion in peace.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the special incidents of the day were prayers for King Edward in\r\nall the principal towns of Greece as well as in the churches of Athens\r\nand prayers and sermons upon the subject in many of the churches of New\r\nYork. On July 3rd Cape Town was brilliantly illuminated as an expression\r\nof pleasure at the King's recovery. Four days later the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales visited Grey's Hospital and His Royal Highness in\r\nspeaking to the institution, for which the King had done so much when\r\nHeir Apparent, referred to the occasion as the first on which he had\r\nbeen able to attempt an expression of the unbounded gratitude which they\r\nall felt for \"the merciful recovery of my dear father, the King.\" He\r\nspoke of the important work undertaken by the Hospital and then\r\nproceeded: \"I wish to take this first opportunity to say how His\r\nMajesty the King, the Queen, and whole of our family have been cheered\r\nand supported during a time of severe trial by the deep sympathy which\r\nhas been displayed towards them from every part of the Empire. And I\r\nshould like to say that we who have watched at the sick bed of the King\r\nfully realize how much, humanly speaking, is due to the eminent surgical\r\nand medical skill, as well as to the patient and highly-trained nursing\r\nwhich it has been His Majesty's good-fortune to enjoy\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nThe Coronation\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the middle of July it was announced that the Royal patient had\r\nrecovered sufficiently to be able to fix a date once more for the\r\nCoronation ceremony and that, with the advice of his physicians, August\r\n9th had been decided upon. Many of the events surrounding and connected\r\nwith the central function originally proposed for June 26th had already\r\ntaken place by special wish or consent of the King. Deeply regretting\r\nthe disappointment of his people and keenly thoughtful, as he always had\r\nbeen, for the feelings and anticipations of others, His Majesty had\r\nspecially ordered the carrying out of two incidents of the Coronation\r\nfestivities upon the date arranged--the Dinner to the London poor and\r\nthe publication of the Coronation honours. In both cases much\r\ndisappointment would have followed delay though it would necessarily\r\nhave been different in degree and effect. On June 26th, as already\r\ndecided upon and expected, the Honour List was made public and the names\r\nof those whom the King desired to especially compliment were announced.\r\nThe promotion of the Earl of Hopetoun to be Marquess of Linlithgow, was\r\nwell deserved by his services as Governor-General of Australia and the\r\ncreation of Lord Milner as a Viscount by his work in South Africa. A\r\nnumber might almost be called personal honours. Sir Francis Knollys, the\r\nveteran and efficient Private Secretary became Lord Knollys; Lord\r\nRothschild and Sir Ernest Cassel, old friends of the King when Prince of\r\nWales, were made members of the Privy Council; Lord Colville of\r\nCulross, Chamberlain to the Queen Alexandra since 1873, was made a\r\nViscount; Sir Francis Laking and Sir Frederick Treves, the well-known\r\nsurgeons, and Sir Thomas Lipton, the King's yachting companion upon more\r\nthan one occasion, were created baronets; the Earl of Clarendon, Lord\r\nChamberlain to the King, and General the Right Hon. Sir Dighton Probyn,\r\nso long the faithful official of his Household, were given the G.C.B.;\r\nViscount Esher was made a K.C.B. General H. R. H. the Duke of Connaught,\r\nbrother of the King and Commanding the Forces in Ireland, was made a\r\nField Marshal, and H. R. H. the Prince of Wales, was created a General.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORONATION HONOURS AND INCIDENTS\r\n\r\nIn the more general list every rank and profession was represented--the\r\nArmy and the Navy in honours conferred upon a large number of officers;\r\nArt in the creation of Sir Edward Poytner as baronet, and the knighting\r\nof Sir F. C. Burnand and Sir Ernest Waterlow; Literature in the\r\nknighting of Sir Conan Doyle, Sir Gilbert Parker and Sir Leslie Stephen;\r\nMedicine and Surgery in the same honour conferred upon Sir Halliday\r\nCroom, Sir Thomas Fraser, Sir H. G. Howse and Sir William Church;\r\nScience in the person of Sir Arthur Rucker; Music in that of Sir Charles\r\nVilliers Stanford; Architecture in that of Sir William Emerson; the\r\nStage in that of Sir Charles Wyndham, The Colonies were amply honoured.\r\nAustralia saw knighthoods bestowed upon Sir E. A. Stone, Sir J. L.\r\nStirling, Sir Henry McLaurin, Sir A. J. Peacock, Sir Arthur Rutledge,\r\nSir John See, Sir A. Thorpe-Douglas, Sir N. E. Lewis. In New Zealand,\r\nCaptain Sir W. Russell-Russell and Sir J. L. Campbell received their\r\nknighthoods. Sir John Gordon Sprigg of Cape Colony, received a G.C.M.G.,\r\nas did Sir Edmund Barton of Australia. In Canada, Sir D. H. McMillan,\r\nSir F. W. Borden and Sir William Mulock received the K.C.M.G. The King\r\nalso announced the establishment of a new Order of Merit, restricted in\r\nnumbers and for the purpose of special Royal recognition of\r\ndistinguished and exceptional merit in the Army and Navy services, and\r\nin Art, Science and Literature. The first list of members included Lord\r\nRoberts, Lord Wolseley, Lord Kitchener, Lord Rayleigh, Lord Lister, Lord\r\nKelvin, Admiral Sir Henry Keppel, Mr. John Morley, Mr. W. E. H. Lecky,\r\nAdmiral Sir E. H. Seymour, Sir William Huggins and Mr. George Frederick\r\nWatts.\r\n\r\nA very important event connected with the Coronation--though not exactly\r\na part of it--and which proceeded in spite of the King's illness, at his\r\nearnest desire, was the Colonial Conference composed of General Lord\r\nGrenfell, Sir J. W. Ridgeway, Sir W. J. Sendall and Sir William McGregor\r\nrepresenting the lesser Colonies, Protectorates and Military posts and\r\nthe Premiers of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Natal, Cape Colony and\r\nNewfoundland. It was called by Mr. Chamberlain, largely as a result of\r\nso many Colonial leaders being in London at this time, and partly\r\nbecause of negotiations between Australia and Canada looking to a\r\ndiscussion during the Coronation period of such questions as trade\r\nrelations between the Commonwealth and the Dominion, the establishment\r\nof a fast mail service, the organization of a better steamship service\r\nbetween Canada and Australia, the establishment of a line of steamers\r\nfrom Australia to Canada _via_ South Africa, and the position of the\r\nPacific Cable scheme. The Conference met a few days after the King's\r\nillness was announced and proceeded to discuss these and other questions\r\nin secret session during the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nA great many of the functions surrounding and forming part of the\r\nCoronation festivities took place during the period immediately\r\nfollowing the Coronation day, which was to have been, and these\r\nincreased in number and brilliancy as the days of actual danger passed\r\naway. On June 26th it was determined not to disappoint the twelve\r\nhundred children from Orphanages and Homes who had been looking forward\r\nfor many weeks to an entertainment promised them by the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales in Marlborough House grounds. They were according\r\nreceived on that day and another twelve hundred on the succeeding day,\r\nand enjoyed their feasts and games to the uttermost. On July 1st, amid\r\nperfect weather, immense and enthusiastic crowds and in the presence of\r\nQueen Alexandra and the Prince and Princess of Wales, a parade of\r\nColonial troops took place at the Horse Guards. The route was lined by\r\nRegular troops and the Colonial force of about two thousand men was\r\nheaded by General Sir Henry Trotter and the Canadian Contingent. The\r\nDuke of Connaught commanded the whole and was supported by a brilliant\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\nThe Queen came first on the review ground accompanied by many members of\r\nthe Royal family, and soon afterwards there appeared a glittering\r\ncavalcade headed by the Prince of Wales in general's uniform. With him\r\nwere Lord Roberts, Commander-in-Chief, the Duke d'Aosta, the Crown\r\nPrinces of Denmark, Greece, Sweden and Roumania, the Grand Duke of\r\nHesse, Prince Nicholas and Prince Andrew of Greece, the Duke of\r\nSaxe-Coburg, Prince Akihitu Komatsu of Japan, Prince Christian and\r\nPrince Albert of Schleswig-Holstein and two Indian Princes. After the\r\ninspection the Prince of Wales personally conferred the Distinguished\r\nService Order, the Victoria Cross, the Companionship of the Bath and the\r\nDistinguished Conduct Medal upon a number of Colonial officers and men\r\nwho had won them in the South African War. The parade followed and men\r\nfrom Canada and Australia, New Zealand, Cape Colony and Natal, Ceylon,\r\nCyprus and many other parts of the British world filed past the Queen\r\nand the Heir Apparent--special cheers greeting the gallant Sir Edward\r\nBrabant of Cape Colony. Well might the _Times_ in its description\r\nexpress the keen regret of all at the absence of the King, and then add:\r\n\"Perhaps never in the whole history of the world has there been such a\r\ndisplay of Empire power as was witnessed yesterday. Here we had men of\r\nevery colour, creed, denomination and descent, all answering to the same\r\nword of command, all performing the same manoeuvre, all animated with\r\nthe single object of paying homage to the head of the greatest Empire\r\nthe world has ever seen.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on June 30th, some fifteen hundred Colonial officers and men\r\nand one thousand Indian troops had embarked on special transports to see\r\nthe great fleet at Spithead and to obtain an insight into that mighty\r\nnaval power of England which the Coronation review was to have brought\r\nbefore the world once more. In the evening a multitude of bon-fires\r\naround the Kingdom, intended to celebrate the Coronation, were fired to\r\nmark the King's having passed the danger-point in his illness, and they\r\nafforded a most weird and striking effect. On the evening of July 1st a\r\nnumber of important festivities took place. At the Inner Temple the\r\nColonial Premiers and distinguished visitors were banquetted. Amongst\r\nthe guests were the Lord Chancellor, Mr. Chamberlain, Lord Cross, Lord\r\nDavy, Lord Macnaghten, Lord Lindley, Lord Knutsford, Lord Robertson, and\r\nSir Edmund Barton of Australia, Sir John Forrest of Australia, Sir\r\nRobert Bond of Newfoundland, Sir Albert Hime of Natal, Sir West\r\nRidgeway, General Sir Francis Grenfell, Sir W. J. Sendall, Sir John\r\nCarrington, Sir William MacGregor, Sir Julian Salomons, Mr. Justice\r\nGirouard of Canada, the Hon. Arthur Peters and Hon. F. W. G. Haultain.\r\nThe Premiers of Australia, Newfoundland and Natal spoke and paid loyal\r\ntributes to the King and the Empire. In his speech Mr. Chamberlain\r\nreferred to Sir Albert Hime's statement that the Colonies would be glad\r\nto join the Councils of the Motherland. \"If that be their feeling, I\r\nsay--and I know I speak the view of the whole of the people of Great\r\nBritain--we shall welcome them. They have enjoyed all the privileges of\r\nthe Empire; if they are now willing to take upon themselves their share\r\nof its responsibilities and its burdens we shall be only too glad of\r\ntheir support.\" The Canadian Dinner, to celebrate Dominion Day, was held\r\nthe same evening; as was Lady Lansdowne's Reception. At the\r\nfirst-mentioned event, the speakers included Lord Strathcona, Sir\r\nCharles Tupper, the Hon. G. W. Ross, the Earl of Dundonald, Sir F. W.\r\nBorden, the Earl of Minto, the Duke of Argyll, Sir W. Mulock and Mr.\r\nSeddon.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL AND COLONIAL FUNCTIONS\r\n\r\nLady Lansdowne's function was given in the magnificent drawing-rooms of\r\nLansdowne House in honour of the special Envoys to the Coronation and\r\nthe Colonial and Indian guests of the King. Nearly all the Colonial\r\nPremiers were present at some period during the evening and the Crown\r\nPrinces of Roumania, Sweden, Japan and Siam, Mgr. Merry del Val, King\r\nLewanika, the Duke and Duchess d'Aosta, the Maharajahs of Gwalior,\r\nJaipur, Kolapore, Bikanur, and Kuch Behar, Sir Pertab Singh, and Mr. and\r\nMrs. Whitelaw Reid. The Ambassadors of France, Austria, Turkey, Spain,\r\nUnited States, Germany, Persia, Belgium and half the countries in the\r\nworld were also in attendance on what had been originally intended to be\r\na reception by the Foreign Secretary and his wife in honour of the\r\nCoronation. After the Dominion Day banquet Lord Strathcona also held a\r\nReception in Piccadilly attended by a great gathering of Canadian and\r\nother Colonial celebrities.\r\n\r\nThe Review of the Indian Coronation Contingent on July 2nd by the Queen\r\nand the Prince of Wales was a brilliant spectacle, the enthusiasm of the\r\nreception accorded the members of the Royal family as great as on the\r\npreceding day, the massed crowds even larger than on that occasion, the\r\nkaleidoscopic colour and glittering splendour of the scene even more\r\nmarked. The ordinary incidents of the parade were much the same as in\r\nthat of the day before but British officers from British countries were\r\nsuperseded by a staff of native Princes blazing with gems, while the\r\nwhite soldier in ordinary British uniform, with only an occasional\r\ncontingent of Houssas, or Fiji troops, or some other dark-coloured\r\nColonial subjects, were replaced by an Oriental combination of varied\r\nuniform and complex colours. They numbered twelve hundred strong and the\r\nEastern side of the display was one which the stricken King--deeply\r\nsensitive to the Imperial significance of the Coronation as he\r\nwas--would have greatly appreciated and understood. The _Times_\r\ndescription was an eloquent one: \"To those sitting in the stands it\r\nappeared as if a great rich ornamental carpet of kaleidoscopic colour\r\nhad been suddenly unrolled across the gravel of the parade-ground; a\r\nline of dazzling tints, before which the impressive grandeur of\r\nHousehold uniforms with attendant cuirasses, bear-skins, scarlet and\r\nbullion, dwarfed into insignificance. The front of the Asiatic line was\r\ncrested with fluttering lance pennons, and beneath these flags were\r\nstalwart frames in vermillion, rich orange, purple-drab, French-grey,\r\nand gold-tipped navy-blue, dressed shoulder to shoulder, making a nether\r\nborder of snow-white or orange breeching.\"\r\n\r\nOne after another the representatives of famous Indian regiments passed\r\nby and no Roman Emperor, or conqueror of old, ever had such a triumphal\r\ngathering in victorious procession through his ancient capital as this\r\nwhich passed the windows of the room where the Emperor-King lay slowly\r\nverging toward recovery. Finally, they had all passed--Rajpoot, Sikh,\r\nPathan, Afridi, Jat, Hazura, Gurkha, Dogra, Multani, Madrassee, Baluchi,\r\nDekani--and, after a great cheer for the Emperor of India and to the\r\nstrains of the National Anthem and personal cheering of another kind,\r\nthe Queen and Princess of Wales drove from the grounds followed by the\r\nPrince and the rest of the Royal family.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a ball was held at the Crystal Palace, the proceeds of\r\nwhich were to go to King Edward's Hospital Fund, as a sort of Coronation\r\ntribute to His Majesty's well-known interest in this subject. The\r\nfunction, which had been managed by Mrs. Arthur Paget, Lady Maud\r\nWilbraham and others was a great success. During the same day Mr. W. H.\r\nGrenfell M.P. entertained the Colonial Premiers and visitors, on behalf\r\nof the British Empire League, at a water-party on the Thames and a\r\nluncheon at Taplow Court. The King's Dinner to the poor people of London\r\ntook place on July 5th and constituted probably the most remarkable\r\nevent of the kind in all history. A statistician estimated that six\r\nhundred thousand persons sat down at ninety miles of tables served by\r\neighty thousand voluntary waiters. The cost of the occasion was about\r\n_£_30,000 and how the guests enjoyed their substantial meal of meat,\r\npotatoes, bread, cheese, pudding, beer, lime-juice, chocolate,\r\ncigarettes and tobacco can be better imagined than stated. There were\r\neight hundred separate feasts and eighteen thousand people entertaining\r\nthe guests while thirteen members of the Royal family devoted themselves\r\nto representing the King and giving the pleasure of their presence to\r\nthe crowded and happy multitudes.\r\n\r\nThe day was beautiful, the arrangements, which had been so largely in\r\nthe hands of Sir Thomas Lipton, were excellent, and the assistance\r\nabundant. The Coronation mugs gave tremendous pleasure and it would be a\r\nproblem in psychology to say why the mere sight of Royalty should give\r\nthe intense satisfaction which it unquestionably afforded the\r\ncrowds--especially the women. Decorations were everywhere and the Prince\r\nand Princess of Wales drove in semi-state all through East London. The\r\nfinal climax to the day was the physicians' announcement from the\r\nPalace that the King was out of danger. Princess Christian, the Duke and\r\nDuchess of Connaught, the Duke and Duchess of Fife, the Prince and\r\nPrincess Charles of Denmark, the Duchess of Albany, the Duke and Duchess\r\nof Argyll did more than their duty in visiting the various points and\r\ngiving the feasters a glimpse of those who represented, even indirectly,\r\ntheir Royal host. On the following day Lord Knollys wrote the Lord\r\nMayor, by command of the King, expressing the greatest satisfaction at\r\nthe success of the affair and at the energy, foresight and skill\r\ndisplayed by those who had taken it in hand. \"I am further commanded\",\r\nhe wrote, \"to repeat how sincerely His Majesty regretted his inability\r\nto be present at any of his dinners and how deeply also he has been\r\ntouched by the loyal and kind feeling so universally displayed when the\r\nbulletin of yesterday morning was read at the various dining-places.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day and at various times and places in the succeeding\r\nweeks the Queen entertained thousands of young servants at tea. Mayors\r\nand other officials or prominent persons presided, and each guest, after\r\nlistening to a musical programme, was sent away happy with a box of\r\nchocolate bearing Queen Alexandra's portrait in colours. A function of a\r\ndifferent character was the great state dinner given by the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales at St. James's Palace on July 8th in honour of the\r\nColonial guests and visitors. The leading members of the suite during\r\nthe late Empire tour were present together with the Countess of\r\nHopetoun, the Earl and Countess of Onslow, the Earl and Countess of\r\nMinto, the Lord and Lady Lamington, the Lord and Lady Strathcona, Mrs.\r\nChamberlain, Sir Wilfrid and Lady Laurier, Sir Edmund and Lady Barton,\r\nMr. Seddon, Sir Gordon and Miss Sprigg, Sir Albert and Miss Hime, Sir R.\r\nBond, Sir John and Lady Forrest, General Sir Edward Brabant, Sir W.\r\nMulock, the Hon. Mr. Fielding and Hon. Mr. Paterson. During this week\r\nthe Countess of Jersey gave three garden parties at Osterley Park in\r\nhonour of the visitors, and Lady Howard de Walden entertained the\r\nColonial and Indian dignitaries at a reception and concert on July 7th.\r\nThree days later the Queen opened the Imperial Coronation Bazaar which\r\nwas held on behalf of the Ormonde St. Hospital for Sick Children. Her\r\nMajesty was accompanied by Princess Victoria, the Duke and Duchess of\r\nConnaught, the Princess Christian and other members of the Royal family,\r\nand the occasion was successful despite a storm of wind and rain. In the\r\nevening the Prince and Princess of Wales held a Reception of some nine\r\nhundred more or less distinguished people at St. James's Palace in\r\nhonour of the Colonial visitors. Most of the members of the Royal family\r\nwere present as well as Royal representatives of Roumania, Denmark,\r\nGreece and Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and the Colonial Premiers and other\r\nofficials or visitors from the outside Empire. It was a really brilliant\r\nfunction, delightful in its surroundings, decorations and illuminations,\r\nand elaborate in its final incident of supper. On the preceding day a\r\ndetachment of troops from Australia and New Zealand, under arrangements\r\nmade by Lord Carrington and the Duke of Argyll, visited Windsor Castle\r\nand were given luncheon in the town with the former nobleman as host.\r\nAbout the same time twelve thousand Kensington school-children were\r\nentertained under the auspices of Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll,\r\nand revelled in a pleasure such as had perhaps never come before to the\r\nmost of them.\r\n\r\nThere were various functions and incidents of interest in the second\r\nweek following the postponed Coronation. One of the most picturesque\r\nscenes ever witnessed in London occurred on July 3rd, when the Fijian\r\nsoldiers, who had come to the Empire capital for the great event, were\r\nbeing driven around the city. On reaching Buckingham Palace they\r\nexpressed a wish to sing an intercessory hymn for the King. With their\r\nbare heads, legs and feet, their long and frizzy hair, their white\r\ncotton skirts and quaint tunics, they made a most unique appearance as\r\nthey turned toward the Palace and chanted words of which the following\r\nis a rough translation:\r\n\r\n    \"The King is great, and noble, and good.\r\n    May he find favour in the sight of the Ruler of Kings;\r\n    May he wax strong and stay the tears of us all, for his people are sad.\r\n    Mighty is the King and his people shall be glad.\"\r\n\r\nOther parties of West African and Indian troops were driven up and\r\ncheered the bare walls of the Palace with fervour. The Duke of\r\nConnaught, and afterwards the Duke of Cambridge, visited the Indian\r\ntroops at Hampton Court. On July 9th, Colonel Lord Binning and the\r\nofficers and men of the Royal Horse Guards provided an entertainment for\r\nthe Colonial contingents at the Albany Barracks. Entertainments for the\r\nColonial Premiers were almost continuous. The Duke and Duchess of\r\nWestminster gave an afternoon party in their honour at Grosvenor House;\r\nLady Lucy Hicks-Beach gave a garden party at the official residence of\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer; parties of the King's Indian guests\r\nwere taken at different times by Lord Esher and Lord Churchill to see\r\nWindsor Castle; Sir Gilbert Parker gave a dinner in honour of the\r\nPremiers of Australia and Canada; Lady Wimborne gave a dinner and\r\nreception for the Colonial Premiers; the Constitutional Club on July 7th\r\nentertained the guests from the Colonies at a banquet presided over by\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough. Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in the course of his\r\nspeech, made a notable declaration: \"The bond of the British Empire, let\r\nme tell you this my fellow-countrymen, and accept it from a man not of\r\nyour own race, the bond of union of the British Empire is allegiance to\r\nthe King without distinction of race or colour.\" The Primrose League in\r\nLondon entertained the visiting Premiers at a banquet; and the\r\nFishmonger's Company did the same. An interesting incident was the visit\r\nof Mr. R. J. Seddon, Premier of New Zealand, and his wife and daughters\r\nto Windsor Castle whence, on July 3rd, they were driven to Frogmore\r\nMausoleum and placed a wreath of lilies and rosebuds on the tomb of the\r\nQueen and on behalf of the people of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe Empire Coronation banquet was the great event of these weeks in the\r\nway of dining and speaking, although Mr. Chamberlain's unfortunate\r\naccident and absence created a serious void. The Earl of Onslow\r\npresided, and amongst the speakers were Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the\r\nMaharajah of Kolapore, Sir Gordon Sprigg and Sir Edmund Barton. Earl\r\nCromer and Lord Lansdowne, Lord Minto, Lord Kelvin and the Maharajahs of\r\nBikanur and Cooch-Behar were also present together with a distinguished\r\narray of Colonial dignitaries.\r\n\r\nAn event of historic importance occurred on July 11th when the Marquess\r\nof Salisbury waited upon the King and tendered his resignation of the\r\npost of Prime Minister. The fact that His Majesty was able to receive\r\nhim and deal with the questions involved also served to indicate his\r\nprogress toward recovery. Mr. A. J. Balfour was at once sent for and,\r\nafter an interview with Mr. Chamberlain, accepted the task of forming a\r\nnew Ministry. It had been pretty well understood that Lord Salisbury\r\nintended to resign when peace had come and the Coronation ceremonies\r\nwere disposed of. Delay had naturally occurred owing to the King's\r\nillness, but His Majesty's progress toward recovery and the fact of the\r\nprincipal Coronation functions having been disposed of--outside of the\r\nevent itself--induced the Premier to feel that he could now lay down his\r\nburdensome position. Mr. Balfour was received again by the King on July\r\n12th and a little later in the day General Lord Kitchener, after passing\r\nin triumphal procession through the streets of London on his return from\r\nSouth Africa, was also admitted into audience by the King and\r\npersonally decorated from his couch with the special Coronation\r\nhonour--the new Order of Merit. Lord Kitchener then dined with the\r\nPrince of Wales, as representing His Majesty, at St. James's Palace.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the King had been winning golden opinions from all sorts and\r\nconditions of men. His plucky conduct at the beginning of the illness,\r\nhis thoughtful consideration for others through every stage of its\r\ncontinuance, his evidently strong place in the hearts of his subjects,\r\ncombined to increase the personal popularity of the Sovereign at home\r\nwhile enhancing or promoting respect for him abroad. As the New York\r\n_Tribune_ put it on the day before the Coronation: \"The King is showing\r\nhimself 'every inch a King' in some of those respects which are most\r\nprized and cherished by all men of his race, and which unfailingly\r\ncommand admiration among all men and all races. Those are the qualities\r\nof unselfishness, and indomitable and uncomplaining pluck.\" He had\r\nstruggled long and earnestly against the malady--not for his own sake,\r\nbecause safety and ease would have early been found in surrender to its\r\nnatural course. When that became finally necessary, and recovery then\r\nsucceeded the period of suspense, his whole desire seemed to be the\r\nre-assuring of the popular mind and the relieving of public\r\ninconvenience. On August 6th the King and Queen Alexandra had landed at\r\nPortsmouth from the Royal yacht and proceeded to London. The stations\r\nwere profusely decorated, and dense crowds were awaiting their arrival\r\nin the capital. At the Metropolitan station the King walked easily to\r\nthe end of the platform and to his carriage, helped the Queen to enter,\r\nand followed himself without any apparent difficulty. The route to\r\nBuckingham Palace was lined with great throngs of people, and His\r\nMajesty acknowledged the continuous cheering with a most cheerful\r\nexpression and by frequently raising his hat. He was described as\r\nlooking better than for a long time past--while the Queen appeared\r\npositively radiant. On the evening of August 8th, the King issued an\r\nautograph message of thanks and appreciation to the nation, through the\r\nHome Secretary, couched in the following terms:\r\n\r\n     \"To My People:--On the eve of my Coronation, an event which I look\r\n     upon as one of the most solemn and most important in my life, I am\r\n     anxious to express to my people at home and in the Colonies and\r\n     India, my heartfelt appreciation of the deep sympathy they have\r\n     manifested towards me during the time my life was in such imminent\r\n     danger.\r\n\r\n     \"The postponement of the ceremony, owing to my illness, caused, I\r\n     fear, much inconvenience and trouble to all those who intended to\r\n     celebrate it, but their disappointment was borne by them with\r\n     admirable patience and temper.\r\n\r\n     \"The prayers of my people for my recovery were heard, and I now\r\n     offer up my deepest gratitude to Divine Providence for having\r\n     preserved my life and given me strength to fulfil the important\r\n     duties which devolve upon me as Sovereign of this great Empire.\r\n\r\n     EDWARD R. I.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this tactful and sympathetic letter was being written by the\r\nSovereign, his people in London were preparing for the great event of\r\nthe morrow. The streets were crowded with moving masses of people; the\r\ndecorations, though not as numerous or imposing as in June, were\r\nnevertheless effective; the streets were illuminated to a considerable\r\nextent, and the stands were nearly all sold out of their seating\r\ncapacity. During the afternoon the King walked in the grounds of\r\nBuckingham Palace and held an Investiture, at which he gave the Order of\r\nthe Garter to the Dukes of Wellington and Sutherland and of the Thistle\r\nto the Duke of Roxburghe and the Earl of Haddington. A little later, he\r\nreceived in audience Ras MaRonnen, the Abyssinian Envoy. Two interesting\r\nannouncements were also made at this time--that Lord Salisbury was\r\nunwell and would be unable to attend the Coronation, and that Bramwell\r\nBooth had been granted special permission by the King to appear at\r\nWestminster Abbey in Salvation Army garb. The first incident marked the\r\nclosing of an era of statecraft; of an age marked by the name and fame\r\nof Queen Victoria and her Ministers. The other illustrated the tact of\r\nthe Sovereign as it proved the existence of a religious toleration and\r\nequality characteristic of the new period in which the new reign was\r\ncommencing.\r\n\r\nOn August 9th the great ceremony finally took place. Though shorn of\r\nsome of the International splendour of the first arrangements and\r\nwithout some of the military and naval glory which would have then\r\nsurrounded the event its Imperial significance was in some respects\r\nenhanced and there was a deeper note in the festivities and an even more\r\nenthusiastic tone in the cheering than would have been possible on the\r\n26th of June. The solemn ceremony in the ancient Abbey--which had not\r\nbeen used or opened to the public since that final practice of the\r\nchoir--was brilliant in all the colours and shadings and dresses and\r\ngems and uniforms of a Royal function while it presented that other and\r\nmore sacred side which all the traditions and forms of the Coronation\r\nceremony so clearly illustrate. The enthusiasm of the people in the\r\nstreets can hardly be described but the spirit and thought and feeling\r\nwere well summed up in the words of a Canadian poet--Jean Blewett:\r\n\r\n    \"Long live the King!\r\n    Long live the King who hath for his own\r\n    The strongest sceptre the world has known,\r\n    The richest Crown and the highest Throne,\r\n    The staunchest hearts, and the heritage\r\n    Of a glorious past, whose every page\r\n    Reads--loyalty, greatness, valour, might.\"\r\n\r\nThe day opened with brilliant promise and bright sunshine, but became\r\novercast and gloomy by the time the Royal progress from the Palace had\r\ncommenced. The crowds gathered early, and soon every seat in the many\r\nstands were filled with expectant and interested people who numbered in\r\nthe end fully half a million. Picked troops, chiefly Household Cavalry\r\nand Colonial and Indian soldiers of the King, to the number of 30,000,\r\nguarded the route, with a picturesque line of white, black, brown and\r\nyellow men of many countries and varied uniforms. When the King and\r\nQueen appeared in their gorgeous state coach from out the gates of\r\nBuckingham Palace they were greeted with tremendous cheers from the\r\nmultitude, and these cheers continued all along the way to the Abbey. In\r\nthe Royal procession were the Prince and Princess of Wales with\r\nthirty-one other members of the Royal family. The Princess was beautiful\r\nin a long Court mantle of purple velvet trimmed with bands of gold and a\r\nminever cape fastened with hooks of gold over a dress of white satin\r\nembroidered in gold and jewelled with diamonds and pearls. Then followed\r\nLord Knollys and Lord Wolseley and Admiral Seymour, Lord Kitchener and\r\nGeneral Gaselee and Lord Roberts, with many other notabilities. The\r\nIndian Maharajahs, who acted as Aides-de-Camp to the King, were\r\nbrilliant in red and white and brown and blue and gold and jewels.\r\nImmediately in front of the King was the Royal escort of Princes and\r\nEquerries with a body of Colonial and Indian troops. The arrival at the\r\nAbbey was marked by great enthusiasm in the massed multitudes\r\nsurrounding the famous building and seated in the crimson-covered stands\r\nwhich had been built on every side.\r\n\r\nThe scene in the interior was indescribable. The blend of many colours\r\nin costume mixed with the time-mellowed harmonies of shade and substance\r\nin the mighty structure, while the air was permeated with the solemn\r\nsounds of the recently sung Litany and the slowly pealing bells of loyal\r\nwelcome. Around were the greatest men and noblest and most beautiful\r\nwomen of Great Britain, and in the stalls was a veritable roll-call of\r\nfame in a world-wide Empire. Lord Salisbury was practically the only\r\nBritish personage of historic repute who was not present while the\r\nveteran Duke of Cambridge appeared as one of the two living links\r\npresent between the Coronation which had marked the beginning of the\r\nVictorian era and that which was now to illustrate the birth of a new\r\nperiod. Into this scene of splendour and revel of colour came the King\r\nand the state officials of his realm.\r\n\r\nThe procession as it passed from the west door of the Abbey through the\r\nstanding and brilliantly-garbed gathering was one of the most stately\r\nspectacles recorded in history. First came the Clergy of the Abbey in\r\ncopes of brown shot with gold, the Archbishops in purple velvet and\r\ngold, the gorgeously-clad officers of the Orders of Knighthood, and the\r\nHeralds. Then came the Standard of Ireland, carried by the Right Hon.\r\nO'Conor Don, the Standard of Scotland by Mr. H. S. Wedderburn, the\r\nStandard of England by Mr. F. S. Dymoke and the Union Standard borne by\r\nthe Duke of Wellington. Various great officials and nobles followed, the\r\ncoronet of each borne by a beautifully dressed page. They included the\r\nLord Privy Seal, the Lord President of the Council the Lord Chancellor\r\nof Ireland, the Lord Archbishop of York, the Lord High Chancellor, the\r\nLord Archbishop of Canterbury. Then came the Earl of Gosford as Lord\r\nChamberlain, Lord Harris carrying the Queen's regalia and the Duke of\r\nRoxburghe carrying Her Majesty's Crown. The Queen herself followed in\r\nrobes of exquisite character and splendour and looking as only the most\r\nbeautiful woman in England could look. On either side of her were the\r\nBishops of Oxford and Norwich with five gentlemen-at-arms to the right\r\nand left of them and Her Majesty's train was borne by the Duchess of\r\nBuccleuch assisted by eight youthful personages of title or heirship to\r\naristocratic position. The Ladies of the Bedchamber followed and then\r\ncame the King's regalia, carried by the Earl of Carrington, the Duke of\r\nArgyll, the Earl of Loudoun, Lord Grey de Ruthven, Viscount Wolseley,\r\nthe Duke of Grafton and Earl Roberts.\r\n\r\nThe next personage in this splendid procession of rich-robed noblemen\r\nand gorgeously-clad officials was the Lord Mayor of London and then came\r\nthe Marquess of Cholmondeley, as Lord Great Chamberlain, the Duke of\r\nAbercorn as High Constable of Ireland, the Earl of Erroll as High\r\nConstable of Scotland, the Earl of Shrewsbury as Lord High Steward of\r\nIreland, the Earl of Crawford as Lord High Steward of Scotland (Deputy\r\nto the Duke of Rothesay and Prince of Wales), the Duke of Norfolk as\r\nEarl Marshal of England, the Marquess of Londonderry carrying the Sword\r\nof State, and the Duke of Fife as Lord High Constable of England.\r\nFollowing these high officers of state came central figures in the\r\nprocession--the Duke of Marlborough as Lord High Steward carrying St.\r\nEdward's ancient Crown, the Earl of Lucan carrying the Sceptre, and the\r\nDuke of Somerset bearing the Orb. The Bishop of Ely followed bearing the\r\nPatina, the Bishop of Winchester bearing the Chalice, the Bishop of\r\nLondon carrying the Bible and then, behind him came the Sovereign of the\r\nmighty little Islands and of an Empire girdling the world in power and\r\nwealth and service to civilization.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty was clad in Royal crimson robes of state and wore the Order\r\nof the Garter. His train was borne by the Earl of Portarlington, the\r\nDuke of Leinster, the Marquess Conyngham, the Earl of Caledon and Lord\r\nSomers, with Viscount Torrington and Hon. P. A. Spencer, as Pages of\r\nHonour and Lord Suffield, Master of the Robes. On either side of the\r\nKing walked the Bishop of Bath and Wells and the Bishop of Durham and\r\nbeside them again ten gentlemen-at-arms. Following the bearers of the\r\nRoyal train came Admiral Sir Michael Culme-Seymour, the Duke of\r\nPortland, General Lord Chelmsford, the Duke of Buccleuch, Earl\r\nWaldgrave, Lord Belper, various Lords-in-Waiting, Lord Knollys, Sir D.\r\nM. Probyn and Major-General Sir Arthur Ellis.\r\n\r\nThe services and ceremonies in the Abbey were beautiful and impressive\r\nin the extreme. Enriched with a thousand years' traditions, moulded upon\r\nancient forms of a sacred and essentially religious character,\r\nsymbolizing and expressing a solemn compact between the Sovereign and\r\nhis subjects, registering by forms of popular acceptance, homage and\r\necclesiastical ritual the final consecration of the King to the\r\ngovernment of his nation, it was a ceremony of exceeding solemnity as\r\nwell as of impressive splendour. The great Abbey had been transformed by\r\ntier above tier of seats, covered with blue and yellow velvet, and so\r\narranged as to form one dazzling mass of brightness and colour when\r\nfilled with the peers in their gorgeous robes and peeresses in their\r\ncrimson velvet mantles, ermine capes and beautiful gowns. As the King\r\nand Queen entered the Abbey on this eventful day and moved toward their\r\nchairs the choir of trained voices sang with exquisite feeling and sound\r\nthe anthem: \"I was glad when they said unto me, we will go into the\r\nhouse of the Lord.\" The King at different times during the ceremonies\r\nwas clad in vestments combining an ecclessiastical character with Royal\r\nmagnificence. The dalmatic was a robe of cloth of gold, the stole was\r\nlined with crimson cloth and richly embroidered, the alb, or sleeveless\r\ntunic of fine cambric, was trimmed with beautiful lace. The whole effect\r\nwas one of harmonized colour and splendour.\r\n\r\nAfter brief prayer, kneeling on faldstools in front of their chairs, the\r\nKing and Queen took their seats and then the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nturned north, south, east and west and, while the King stood, he said to\r\nthe people: \"Sirs, I here present unto you King Edward, the undoubted\r\nKing of this Realm; wherefore all you who have come this day to do your\r\nhomage, are you willing to do the same?\" Ringing acclamations of \"God\r\nsave the King,\" to the sound of trumpets strongly blown, greeted this\r\npart of the ceremony. The Bible, Patina, Chalice and Regalia were then\r\nborne to the Altar, and the Communion service of the Church of England\r\nproceeded with. Then followed the taking of the Coronation Oath, the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury first asking His Majesty if he was willing to\r\ndo so and receiving an affirmative reply. The questions and answers were\r\nas follows, the King holding a Bible in his hands:\r\n\r\n     _Archbishop._ Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the\r\n     people of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the\r\n     Dominions thereto belonging, according to the statutes in\r\n     Parliament agreed on and the respective laws and customs of the\r\n     same?\r\n\r\n     _The King._ I solemnly promise to do so.\r\n\r\n     _Archbishop._ Will you to your power cause law and justice, in\r\n     mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?\r\n\r\n     _The King._ I will.\r\n\r\n     _Archbishop._ Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the\r\n     laws of God, the true profession of the Gospel, and the Protestant\r\n     Reformed religion established by law? And will you maintain and\r\n     preserve inviolably the Settlement of the Church of England and the\r\n     doctrine, worship, discipline and government thereof as by law\r\n     established in England? And will you preserve unto the Bishops and\r\n     Clergy of England and to the Church therein committed to their\r\n     charge, all such rights and privileges as by law do, or shall\r\n     appertain to them or any of them?\r\n\r\n     _The King._ All this I promise to do.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty, when he had said these words passed to the Altar, knelt\r\ndown and with his hand on the Bible said: \"The things which I have here\r\nbefore promised I will perform and keep. So help me God.\" After signing\r\nthe Oath the King returned to his chair. A hymn, a prayer by the\r\nArchbishop and an anthem followed. Meanwhile His Majesty, after being\r\nrelieved of his crimson robes by the Lord Great Chamberlain and of his\r\ncap of state, proceeded to King Edward's Chair, near the Altar and, and\r\nwhile four Knights of the Garter in their magnificent robes and\r\ninsignia--the Earl of Rosebery, Earl of Derby, Earl of Cadogan and Earl\r\nSpencer--held over him a Pall of golden Silk, the Archbishop, assisted\r\nby the Dean of Westminster, anointed him with holy oil on the crown of\r\nthe head, on his breast and on his hands. His Grace of Canterbury\r\nconcluded this part of the ceremony with the words: \"And as Solomon was\r\nanointed King by Zadok the Priest and Nathan the Prophet, so be you\r\nanointed, blessed and consecrated King over this People whom the Lord\r\nyour God hath given you to rule and govern. In the name of the Father,\r\nand the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen.\" The King, after a brief prayer by\r\nthe Archbishop then resumed his place in King Edward's Chair and was\r\nrobed by the Dean of Westminster with cloth of gold and symbolic girdle.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENTS OF THE CEREMONY\r\n\r\nVarious typical or symbolic functions were then performed. The Lord\r\nGreat Chamberlain touched the King's feet with a pair of golden spurs as\r\nconstituting the ancient emblems of Knighthood; a Sword of State, with\r\nscabbard of purple velvet, was then handed with elaborate ceremony to\r\nthe Archbishop who, after placing it upon the Altar and delivering a\r\nshort prayer proffered it to His Majesty about whom it was girt by the\r\nLord Great Chamberlain, His Grace of Canterbury giving the following\r\ninjunction: \"With this sword do justice, stop the growth of iniquity,\r\nprotect the Holy Church of God, help and defend widows and orphans,\r\nrestore the things that are going to decay, maintain the things that are\r\nrestored, furnish and reform what is amiss and confirm what is in good\r\norder; that by doing these things you may be glorious in all virtue; and\r\nso faithfully serve our Lord Jesus Christ in this life that you may\r\nreign for ever with him in the life that is to come.\" The King then\r\nplaced the Sword upon the Altar from which it was presently taken and\r\nheld drawn from the scabbard before him during the rest of the\r\nceremony. The Dean of Westminster then invested His Majesty with the\r\nArmilla, or gold bracelets, and with the Imperial mantle of cloth of\r\ngold, while the Archbishop presented the Orb of Empire--a golden ball,\r\nmade originally for Charles II. with a band covered with gems and a\r\ncross set in brilliants. As he did so His Grace said: \"Receive this\r\nImperial Robe and Orb; and the Lord your God endow you with knowledge\r\nand wisdom, with majesty and with power from on high; the Lord clothe\r\nyou with the robe of righteousness and with the garments of salvation.\"\r\n\r\nThe next incident was the placing of a gold ring--carried off by James\r\nII. in his flight, and afterwards recovered in Rome by George IV.--upon\r\nthe fourth finger of the King's right hand with an Episcopal injunction\r\nto receive the ring as \"the ensign of kingly dignity and of defence of\r\nthe Catholic faith.\" Then came the presentation of the Sceptre by the\r\nArchbishop as the ensign of kingly power and justice, and the rod of\r\nequity and mercy, while the Duke of Newcastle as Hereditary Lord of the\r\nManor of Worksop, had the privilege or right of placing a glove upon the\r\nKing's hand. Following this came the central and most dramatic feature\r\nof the ceremonies--the placing of the Crown upon His Majesty's head by\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury. As the action was performed the venerable\r\nAbbey shook with the acclamation of \"God Save the King\" while the\r\ntrumpets blared and the scene, already brilliant with varied splendours,\r\nflashed in added beauty when the Peers and Peeresses put on their\r\nglittering coronets. A brief prayer and the presentation of a copy of\r\nthe Bible by the Archbishop followed with a benediction ending in the\r\nwords: \"The Lord give you a fruitful country and healthful seasons;\r\nvictorious fleets and armies and a quiet Empire; a faithful Senate, wise\r\nand upright Counsellors and magistrates, a loyal nobility and dutiful\r\ngentry; a pious and learned and useful Clergy; an honest, industrious\r\nand obedient community.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the _Te Deum_ was sung by the choir, His Majesty for the first\r\ntime took his place upon the Throne surrounded by the leading officials,\r\nnobles and clergy, and listened to a brief exordium from the Archbishop,\r\nending with the hope that God would \"establish your Throne in\r\nrighteousness that it may stand fast for evermore.\" Then came the\r\nimpressive ceremony of Homage. First the Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nkneeling in front of His Majesty with all the Bishops in their places,\r\nrepeated an oath of allegiance. Then the Prince of Wales, taking off his\r\ncoronet, knelt in front of the King and the other Princes of the blood\r\nroyal knelt in their places and repeated the quaint mediæval formula in\r\nwhich they swore \"to become your liege man of life and limb and of\r\nearthly worship, and faith and truth I will bear unto you, to live and\r\ndie against all manner of Folks.\" At this point occurred an abbreviation\r\nof the ceremony as well as an _impromptu_ change in the proceedings. As\r\nthe Prince rose from his knees touched the Crown on his father's head\r\nand kissed his left cheek in the the formal manner prescribed, the King\r\nrose, threw his arms round his son's neck for a moment and then took his\r\nhand and shook it warmly. After the homage of the Heir Apparent each\r\nPeer of the realm should have followed the traditionary form in the\r\norder of his rank and touched the Crown and kissed the King's cheek.\r\nThis was modified, however, so as to enable each grade of the nobility\r\nto perform the function through its representative of oldest patent--the\r\nDuke of Norfolk, the Marquess of Winchester, the Earl of Shrewsbury, the\r\nViscount Hereford and the Baron de Ros. After this had been done the\r\ntrumpets once more sounded their acclaims and the audience joined in\r\nshouting \"God save King Edward.\"\r\n\r\nA short but stately ceremony of crowning the Queen then followed. The\r\nArchbishop of York officiated and four Peeresses upheld the Cloth of\r\nGold over Her Majesty as she was anointed upon the head. A ring was\r\nplaced upon her finger with a brief prayer, and a sceptre in her hand\r\nwith the following words: \"Grant unto this thy servant Alexandra, our\r\nQueen, that by the powerful and mild influence of her piety and virtue,\r\nshe may adorn the high dignity which she hath obtained, through Jesus\r\nChrist our Lord.\" Her Majesty was then escorted from the Altar to her\r\nown Throne, bowing reverently to the King as she passed him to take her\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe King and Queen then passed to the Altar together, taking off their\r\nCrowns and kneeling on faldstools and His Majesty formally offered the\r\nSacrament of Communion to the Archbishop. After thus indicating his\r\nheadship of the National Church, the King returned with his Consort to\r\ntheir chairs and listened to some brief prayers. Thence they returned to\r\nthe Altar, received Communion from the Archbishop of Canterbury and then\r\npassed into the Chapel of Edward the Confessor accompanied by a stately\r\nprocession. There they were arrayed in Royal robes of purple and velvet,\r\nin place of the mantels previously worn, and passed with slow and\r\nstately dignity down the nave, out to their carriage and thence through\r\nmasses of cheering people to Buckingham Palace.\r\n\r\nThere were several incidents in connection with the Coronation\r\nceremonies which deeply impressed the onlookers. One was the spontaneous\r\nand obvious sincerity of the King's affectionate greeting to his son.\r\nAnother was the enfeebled condition of the aged Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. With his massive frame, brilliant intellect, and piercing\r\neyes Dr. Temple had lived a life of intense mental activity and\r\nreligious zeal, but in these declining days the massive form had become\r\nbent and trembling, the memory and the eyes found difficulties in the\r\nsolemn words of the service, and his shaking hands could hardly place\r\nthe Crown upon the head of his King. But the latter's solicitude and\r\nanxious care to save the Primate any exertion, not absolutely essential,\r\nwere marked and noticed by all that vast assemblage. The Royal patient\r\nwas transformed, by kindly sympathy, into a guardian of the Archbishop's\r\nweakness. When tendering his homage as first of all the subjects of the\r\nKing, the aged Primate almost fainted and was unable to rise from his\r\nknees until His Majesty assisted him. Prior to the actual Coronation,\r\nMr. Edwin A. Abbey, R.A., who had been commissioned by the King to paint\r\na picture of the historic scene, was allowed to take note of the\r\nsurroundings. Another incident of the event was the presence of the\r\nDuchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz--placed by desire of Queen Alexandra in\r\na seat at the exact spot which she had held during the Coronation of\r\nQueen Victoria.\r\n\r\nOn the day following the great event a final bulletin was issued by Sir\r\nF. Laking and Sir F. Treves, which stated that \"His Majesty bore the\r\nstrain of the Coronation ceremony perfectly well, and experienced but\r\nlittle fatigue. The King has had a good night, and his condition is in\r\nevery way satisfactory.\" Being Sunday, special services were held in the\r\nSt. James's Chapel Royal, at St. Paul's Cathedral, in Marlborough House\r\nChapel, and at St. Margaret's, Westminster. On Monday, a Royal message\r\nto the nation was made public through Mr. Balfour, the Prime Minister.\r\nDated on Coronation Day, it described the Osborne House estate, on the\r\nIsle of Wight, as being the private property of the Sovereign, and\r\nexpressed his wish to establish this once favourite residence of the\r\nlate Queen as a National Convalescent Home for Officers of the Army and\r\nNavy--maintaining intact, however, the rooms which were in her late\r\nMajesty's personal occupation. \"Having to spend a considerable part of\r\nthe year in the capital of this Kingdom and in its neighbourhood, at\r\nWindsor, and having also strong home ties in the County of Norfolk,\r\nwhich have existed now for nearly forty years, the King feels he will\r\nbe unable to make adequate use of Osborne House as a Royal residence,\r\nand he accordingly has determined to offer the property in the Isle of\r\nWight as a gift to the nation.\" Following the Coronation came multitudes\r\nof editorial comments upon the event, and one of the most concise and\r\nexpressive was that of the London _Times_: \"The significance of the\r\nCoronation ceremony on Saturday lay in its profound sincerity, as a\r\nsolemn compact between the Sovereign and his subjects, ratified by oath,\r\nand blessed by the highest dignitaries of the National Church. It was a\r\ncovenant between a free people, accustomed for long centuries to be\r\ngoverned according to statutes in Parliament agreed on, and their\r\nhereditary King, and a supplication from both to God that the King may\r\nbe endowed with all princely virtues in the exercise of his great\r\noffice. Though the details of the ceremony do not mean to us all they\r\nmeant to our forefathers, the ceremony itself is a no less strong and\r\nenduring bond between the King and subjects. The most striking feature\r\nof the Coronation was that it was the first to be attended by the\r\nstatesmen of self-governing Colonies, and by the feudatory Princes of\r\nIndia.\"\r\n\r\nWith the event also came an Ode from Mr. Alfred Austin, entitled \"The\r\nCrowning of Kingship.\" On August 11th the King held a Council at\r\nBuckingham Palace, attended by the retiring and new members of the\r\nCabinet; invested many distinguished personages with their Coronation\r\nhonours; and gave an audience to Sir Joseph Dimsdale, Lord Mayor of\r\nLondon, who presented the City's Coronation gift of $575,000 toward the\r\nKing Edward Hospital Fund, in which His Majesty had so long taken so\r\ndeep an interest and to which, on this occasion, there was contributed\r\n20,000 penny donations from the poorest quarters of London.\r\n\r\nVarious functions of a Coronation character or connection ensued. On\r\nAugust 12th some 2000 Colonial troops who were present at the event, in\r\na representative capacity, from British dominions beyond the seas, were\r\nreceived by the King on the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Under the\r\nRoyal canopy were the Queen and the children of the Prince of Wales, and\r\nin attendance were Earl Roberts, Lord Kitchener, Mr. Chamberlain and\r\nvarious Colonial Premiers, including Sir Wilfrid and Lady Laurier. After\r\nthe march past, the King pinned a Victoria Cross on the breast of\r\nSergeant Lawrence, and the Prince of Wales conferred Coronation medals\r\nupon the officers and men. His Majesty then addressed the troops as\r\nfollows: \"It has afforded me great pleasure to see you here to-day and\r\nto have the opportunity of expressing my high appreciation of your\r\npatriotism and the way you distinguished yourselves in South Africa. The\r\nservices you have rendered the Mother-Country will never be forgotten by\r\nme, and they will, I am sure, cement more firmly than ever the union of\r\nour distant Colonies with the other parts of my great Empire.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day the Indian troops sent from the great Eastern realm\r\nto honour the Coronation of its Emperor were reviewed at the same place.\r\nHis Majesty wore a jewelled sword which cost some $50,000, and had been\r\npresented to him on the previous day by the Maharajah of Jaipur. The\r\nscene was a most brilliant and picturesque one. The British notables\r\npresent wore military or Levée dress; the great lawn of the Palace was a\r\nsplendid spectacle in red, yellow, green and blue; the Eastern Princes\r\nwere gorgeous in jewels and many-coloured raiment, and the little\r\nPrinces Edward and Albert of Wales constituted themselves Aides of the\r\nKing and brought several general officers up to have an audience. After\r\nthe march past and the distribution of medals at the hands of the Prince\r\nof Wales, His Majesty addressed the troops in the following words: \"I\r\nwish to convey to all ranks the high satisfaction it has given me to see\r\nthis splendid contingent from India. I almost feared, owing to my\r\nserious illness, that I would be prevented from having the advantage of\r\nseeing you, but I am glad to say that by God's mercy I am well again. I\r\nrecognize among you many of the regiments I had the advantage of seeing\r\nat Delhi during my tour of India.\" During the next few days various\r\nminor functions took place, and the Colonial leaders especially were\r\nfeasted and entertained in every possible way.\r\n\r\nOn August 17th the final event occurred in connection with the\r\nCoronation. It was the mighty greeting of a great fleet to the Sovereign\r\nof a wide-flung realm. It was the inspection of a naval force which a\r\ngeneration before could have dominated the seas of the world and put all\r\ncivilized nations under tribute. Gathered together from the Home\r\nStation, the Channel squadron and the Cruising squadron; without the\r\ndetachment of a ship from foreign waters or Colonial stations, it\r\nincluded 20 battleships, 24 cruisers and 47 torpedo crafts, with an\r\nouter fringe of foreign vessels contributed in complimentary fashion to\r\nhonour the occasion. From Spithead to the Isle of Wight the horizon was\r\nblack with great grim vessels of war decked out with flags, and as the\r\nKing's yacht approached the first line of ships, a hundred Royal salutes\r\nmade a tremendous burst of sound such as probably the greatest\r\nbattle-fields of history had never heard. As the King, in Admiral's\r\nuniform, stood upon the deck of his vessel and passed slowly down the\r\nlines, a signal given at a certain moment evoked one of the most\r\nimpressive incidents which even he had ever encountered--a simultaneous\r\nroar of cheers from the powerful throats of 50,000 enthusiastic sailors.\r\nThe sound rolled from shore to shore, and ship to ship, was echoed from\r\n100,000 spectators on land and sea, and repeated again from the\r\nbattleships. The King was deeply moved by this crowning tribute of\r\nloyalty, and at once signaled his gratification to the fleet and an\r\ninvitation to its flag officers to come aboard his yacht and receive a\r\npersonal expression of his feelings. In the evening electric and\r\ncoloured lights of every kind and in countless number combined with\r\nflashing searchlights to illuminate the great fleet and to cast a\r\nglamour of fairy land over the splendid scene.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the morning, His Majesty had received on board his yacht\r\nthe celebrated Boer Generals, Botha, De Wet and De la Rey. Afterwards,\r\nin company with Lord Kitchener and Earl Roberts they had returned to\r\nLondon greatly pleased with the cordiality of their reception and\r\nespecially gratified at the kind manner of Queen Alexandra. Following\r\nthe official Naval Review, the King on the next day visited the fleet in\r\na stormy sea and watched it go through certain manoeuvres of a\r\npractical kind before being dispersed to its different local stations.\r\nOn his return to London he found the Shah of Persia a guest of the\r\nnation and awaiting formal reception at the hands of its Monarch. And\r\nthus King Edward took up again his unceasing round of duty and\r\nceremonial and high responsibility. In the past year or two he had gone\r\nthrough every variety of emotional experience and official work and\r\nbrilliant ceremony--his mother's death and the consequent mourning of a\r\nnation and empire; his own assumption of new and heavy duties; the\r\nspecial labours of an expectant period; the time of serious illness and\r\nthe anxieties of complex responsibility to a world-wide public; the\r\nrealization of his Coronation hopes; the change from an old to a new\r\nperiod stamped by the change in his national advisers and the presence\r\nof his Colonial Premiers. He now entered upon his further lifework, with\r\nchastened feelings in a personal sense but, it is safe to say, with high\r\nand brilliant hopes for the future of his own home country and its\r\nfar-flung Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Reign of King Edward\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of this reign--not long in years--is yet crowded with\r\nevents, rich in national and Imperial developments, conspicuous in the\r\nimportance of its discussions and international controversies. The first\r\nbrief months, which have been already reviewed, saw the completion of\r\nthe memorable Empire tour of the new Prince of Wales and the settling\r\ndown of Australia to a life of national unity and progress; the\r\nconclusion of the South African War and the beginning of an\r\nextraordinary process of unification which was in a few years to evolve\r\nthe Union of South Africa; the almost spectacular incidents of the\r\nCoronation and the important proceedings of the Colonial Conference of\r\n1902. In July of this latter year the Marquess of Salisbury retired and\r\nwas succeeded in the Premiership by his nephew, Arthur J. Balfour. To\r\nthe King this meant the removal of a strong arm and powerful intellect\r\nand respected personality from his side and increased the importance of\r\nhis own experience and _prestige_ as a statesman.\r\n\r\nSomething has already been said of the qualities with which King Edward\r\nentered upon his task and with which it was conducted to the moment when\r\nin passing to his rest he said: \"It is all over, but I think I have done\r\nmy duty.\" The unique feature of his career in a personal sense was his\r\namazing popularity, the real affection with which every class in the\r\ngreat community of the British Isles regarded him. In the days of his\r\nunofficial labours as Prince of Wales, Lord Beaconsfield greatly\r\nesteemed him and Mr. Gladstone was \"devotedly attached\" to him. At the\r\nlatter's funeral the Prince went up to Mrs. Gladstone and in a spirit of\r\nspontaneous courtesy bent over her hand and kissed it with an air of\r\nsympathy so great as to be beyond the expression of words. It was little\r\nacts such as this that won unstinted liking for the man as well as\r\nloyalty to the King. It was this magnetism of the kindly heart, this\r\ninstinctive courtesy of character, coupled with a remarkable dignity of\r\nbearing at the right moment and in the right place, and a rare memory\r\nfor faces and incidents and peoples and places, that made King Edward so\r\ntruly the Sovereign of his people. In this connection a religious orator\r\nof the Radical type in London--Rev. R. J. Campbell--told an audience in\r\nToronto, Canada, on July 22, 1903, that \"Queen Victoria is gone but her\r\nson remains and I would not exchange King Edward, with all the criticism\r\nthat has been directed against him, for any Sovereign ruler on the face\r\nof the earth or any President of any Republic on either side of the\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the visit to Paris of this year, which paved the way for\r\nbetter relations in the future between Britain and France, the King made\r\na successful tour of a part of Ireland--July 21st to August 1st--and\r\nimpressed himself upon the mercurial temperament of the sons of Erin. In\r\nSeptember came the memorable retirement of Mr. Chamberlain from the\r\nBalfour Government; his declaration of devotion to the new-old ideal of\r\nlimited protective tariffs for the United Kingdom _plus_ preferential\r\nduties in favour of the external Empire; the split in the Conservative\r\nparty and the presentation of a great issue to the people which,\r\nhowever, was clouded over by other policies in either party and had not,\r\nup to the time of the King's death, won a clear presentation to the\r\npeople as a whole. Mr. Chamberlain's letter to Mr. Balfour dated\r\nSeptember 8th expressed regret that the all-important question of fiscal\r\nreform had been made a party issue by its opponents; recognised the\r\npresent political force of the cry against taxing food and the\r\nimpossibility of immediately carrying his Preferential policy; suggested\r\nthat the Government should limit their immediate advocacy to the\r\nassertion of greater fiscal freedom in foreign negotiations with a power\r\nof tariff retaliation, when necessary, as a weapon; and declared his own\r\nintention to stand aside, with absolute loyalty to the Government in\r\ntheir general policy but in an independent position, and with the\r\nintention of \"devoting myself to the work of explaining and popularizing\r\nthose principles of Imperial union which my experience has convinced me\r\nare essential to our future welfare and prosperity.\" In his reply the\r\nPremier paid high tribute to Mr. Chamberlain's services to the Empire,\r\nsympathized personally with his Imperial ideals and agreed with him that\r\nthe time was not ripe for the Government or the country to go to the\r\nextreme length of his Preferential policy.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain's action and policy gave a thrill of pleasant\r\nhopefulness to Imperialists everywhere; it stirred up innumerable\r\ncomments in the British, Colonial and Foreign press; it made Germany\r\npause in a system of fiscal retaliation and tariff war into which she\r\nhad intended to enter with Canada--and with Australia and South Africa\r\nif they presumed to grant a tariff preference to Britain. Meanwhile, the\r\nKing had suffered the loss, a personal as well as national one, of Lord\r\nSalisbury's retirement from office and his death not long afterwards;\r\nthe Balfour-Chamberlain Government had struggled along until the Tariff\r\nReform movement, as above described, broke in upon and dissipated the\r\nparty's unanimity of opinion and uniformity of action; a long series of\r\nLiberal victories at bye-elections reduced the Conservative majority\r\nfrom 134 as it was in 1900 to 69 in November, 1905; Mr. Balfour, in his\r\nNewcastle speech of November 14th, defined his fiscal policy as (1)\r\nRetaliation with a view to compelling the removal of some of the\r\nrestrictions in Foreign markets and (2) the calling of a Conference of\r\nEmpire leaders to arrange, if possible, a closer commercial union of the\r\nEmpire. As to himself he had never been and was not now \"a\r\nprotectionist.\" In December he resigned and the King called on Sir H.\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, the Liberal Leader in the Commons, to form a\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nA general election followed in which the Liberals swept the great towns\r\nof the country--excluding London and Birmingham--and came back with the\r\nlargest majority in modern English history; the total of the Labour,\r\nHome Rule, Liberal and Radical majority being 376 over the supporters of\r\nTariff Reform. The result, however, evoked on February 14, 1906, a\r\ndeclaration from Mr. Balfour in favour of \"a moderate general tariff on\r\nmanufactured goods and the imposition of a small duty on Foreign corn,\"\r\nand this united the Conservative or Unionist party with the exception of\r\nabout sixteen Free-trade members who still followed the Duke of\r\nDevonshire. The rise of the Labour Party began at this election; the\r\nserious illness of Mr. Chamberlain followed and hampered Conservative\r\nwork and progress; the retirement of the Premier took place early in\r\n1908 and, on April of that year, the King called on Mr. Asquith to form\r\nthe Ministry which carried its election in 1910 by so small a Liberal\r\nmajority. The reconstruction of 1908 was notable for the rise or\r\npromotion of the fighting, aggressive, youthful elements in the new\r\nLiberalism--men like David Lloyd-George, Winston Churchill and Reginald\r\nMcKenna. There followed the establishment of Old-Age Pensions at an\r\ninitial expenditure of $40,000,000 a year; the prolonged and ultimately\r\nsuccessful struggle to increase the taxation upon landed interests,\r\nproperty, and invested income by means of the much-discussed Budget of\r\n1909; the natural resentment of the Lords, the Conservatives, and many\r\nwho were neither--as illustrated in the subsequent wiping out of the\r\nLiberal majority in England itself; the constitutional issue which the\r\nLiberals so cleverly forced to the front with the House of Lords as\r\ntheir chief antagonists and which relegated Tariff Reform temporarily to\r\nthe background; the prolonged period in which King Edward took minute\r\nand anxious and personal interest in the question.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt as to this interest or as to the natural and valid\r\nreasons for it. A House of Lords, either abolished or existing without\r\npower in the constitution, would leave no check upon the Commons except\r\nthe King and this might be bad for both the Commons and the Sovereign.\r\nOver and over again in English history the people have reversed the\r\naction or vote of the Commons but if this was ever to be done in future\r\nit could only be through the interjection of the King's veto, and the\r\nbringing of the Crown into the hurly-burly of party struggle. This would\r\nbe the very thing which all parties had hitherto endeavoured to prevent\r\nand for at least seventy years had been successful in preventing. Then\r\ncame the general elections of 1909-10, with their continual query as to\r\nwhat the King would do if the Liberals did win. Would he accept the\r\nGovernment's policy and the proposed Commons legislation as to the Lords\r\nand thus take an active part in the destruction of one portion of the\r\nconstitution which he was pledged to guard--through and by means of the\r\ncreation of hundreds of peers to swamp the Conservative vote in that\r\nHouse? Or would he take the situation boldly in hand and insist on\r\nanother election with this question of practical abolition of the Lords\r\nas the distinct issue before the people? It was little wonder that His\r\nMajesty's physicians should declare after his death that the political\r\nsituation had been one of its causes! It must be remembered that in all\r\ncountries the Upper House and the aristocracy are natural and\r\ninevitable, if not necessary, adjuncts to and supporters of a Throne.\r\nWhere, as in Britain, that House and that aristocracy have upon the\r\nwhole much to be proud of in personal achievement, much to be credited\r\nwith in social legislation and still more to be approved of in the\r\nindividual public work of its Salisburys, Roseberys, Devonshires, and a\r\nmultitude of other historic personalities with, also, a close and vital\r\ninterest in the country through large landed responsibilities, the\r\nsituation can readily be appreciated. Not that the Monarchy was an issue\r\nin itself; but there can be no doubt, despite such speeches as the\r\nfollowing quotation from Mr. Winston Churchill's address at Southport on\r\nDecember 8, 1909, that King Edward felt the danger of weakening his\r\nimmediate, natural and fitting environment of (with certain exceptions)\r\nan energetic and patriotic aristocracy surrounding a popular Throne:\r\n\r\n     \"There is no difficulty in vindicating the principle of a\r\n     hereditary monarchy. The experience of every country and of all the\r\n     ages show the profound wisdom which places the supreme leadership\r\n     of the state beyond the reach of private ambition and above the\r\n     shocks and changes of party strife. And, further, let it not be\r\n     forgotten that we live under a limited and constitutional monarch.\r\n     The Sovereign reigns but does not govern; that is a maxim we were\r\n     all taught out of our school-books. The British monarchy has no\r\n     interests divergent from those of the British people. It enshrines\r\n     only those ideas and causes upon which the whole British people are\r\n     united. It is based upon the abiding and prevailing interests of\r\n     the nation and thus, through all the swift changes of the last\r\n     hundred years, through all the wide developments of a democratic\r\n     state, the English monarchy has become the most secure, as it is\r\n     the most ancient and the most glorious monarchy in the whole of\r\n     Christendom.\"\r\n\r\nWhile all this political change and controversy was going on the King\r\nwas performing a multitude of personal and social and State duties.\r\nThere was always the vast amount of detailed study of current\r\ndocuments--all of which he looked into before signing as had Queen\r\nVictoria before him; there was the strenuous and incessant round of\r\nState functions including the reception of visiting Sovereigns and\r\nambassadors, and special deputations, visits to cities and towns and the\r\nprivate houses of his greater subjects, State dinners to men and women\r\nof every school of thought and life in its higher branches, frequent\r\ntrips to the Continent and continuous conferences with public men. In\r\nthis connection it is interesting to note that just before the General\r\nElections--towards the close of 1909--he did what no Sovereign had done\r\nfor many a long year and did it not only without criticism but with\r\npublic approval when he called Lord Lansdowne, Lord Rosebery and Mr.\r\nBalfour into quiet conference regarding the political situation. How\r\nmany others of all parties he may have invited to similar discussions in\r\nthe privacy of Buckingham or Windsor only such a personage as his\r\nfaithful and old-time Secretary, Lord Knollys, really knows. Military\r\nand Naval reviews were amongst the more important general functions of\r\nthese years coupled with gracious and conciliatory visits to Ireland in\r\n1904 and 1907. In this latter year he reviewed a magnificent fleet of\r\nwarships at Portsmouth eleven miles long, headed by the first of the\r\nDreadnaughts, and manned by 35,000 officers and men. Upon another\r\noccasion in 1909, the greatest fleet ever gathered together in any\r\nwaters in the history of the world was also reviewed by His Majesty as,\r\nperhaps, a comment on the recently revealed crisis caused by German\r\nNaval construction. As to this the King was intensely concerned and we\r\ncan safely assume that if one cause of his latter ill-health was\r\npolitical worry another cause may well have been the Naval rivalry of a\r\nPower which boasted 4,000,000 of a trained Army to Britain's 250,000\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nWith all these varied home duties and his many diplomatic efforts King\r\nEdward never forgot his own external Empire, never overlooked his vast\r\ninterests overseas. To India in 1908 had gone a vivid and statesmanlike\r\nRoyal Message, on November 2d, which recalled to the minds of its\r\nPrinces and peoples their fifty years of progress under the Crown, the\r\nobligations which they were under to the liberty-loving rule of Britain,\r\nand the pride of their Emperor in governing so vast a congeries of races\r\nand interests. To them also in 1906 he had sent the Prince and Princess\r\nof Wales in a tour which repeated his own triumphs of 1876. To South\r\nAfrica, upon frequent and appropriate occasions, came expressions of the\r\nKing's interest in the people's welfare, in their strivings for unity,\r\nin their efforts to retrieve the misfortunes of war. It was King\r\nEdward's Imperial policy that dictated the sending of the Prince of\r\nWales to open the first Parliament of the Union of South Africa--a\r\npolicy which his own death rendered impossible--as curiously enough, it\r\nhad been Queen Victoria's last public duty to send the Duke of\r\nCornwall--as he then was--to open the first Parliament of the Australian\r\nCommonwealth. It was the King who sent the Duke of Connaught to visit\r\nEast Africa in 1906 and Prince Arthur of Connaught to return from Japan\r\n_via_ Canada in the same year. To the people of Australia Lord\r\nNorthcote, the new Governor-General, on January 28, 1904, conveyed a\r\nRoyal Message of greeting and then proceeded to say that: \"Every\r\nconstitutional process having for its object the linking together of the\r\ndifferent component parts of this great Empire is sure to be\r\nsympathetically regarded by our Sovereign and I know his hope is that\r\nhis people who live outside the narrow seas of Great Britain may believe\r\nthat His Majesty regards them primarily, not as inhabitants of colonies\r\nor dependencies of the Mother-country, but as equally valued component\r\nparts of one mighty nation.\"\r\n\r\nAs to Canada and King Edward much might be said. On July 22, 1905,\r\nHis Majesty was at Bisley and presented the Kolapore Cup to the\r\nproud Canadian team which had won it and to whose Commander,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel A. G. Hesslein, a few kind and tactful words were\r\naddressed. About the same time it was announced that the London Hospital\r\nFund in which the King had for many years taken a deep personal\r\ninterest, and in the maintenance of which he was really the chief power,\r\nhad received a gift of $1,000,000 from Lord Mount Stephen of Canadian\r\nPacific Railway fame. In 1906 His Majesty showed special interest in\r\nCanadian affairs. A cablegram through Lord Elgin, on January 2d,\r\nexpressed the King's regret at the sudden death of the Honorable R.\r\nPrefontaine; he received Canadian delegates to the Empire Commercial\r\nCongress at Windsor on July 13th, when Sir D. H. McMillan, Sir Sandford\r\nFleming, Messrs. R. Wilson-Smith, G. E. Drummond, F. H. Mathewson, J. F.\r\nEllis and W. F. Cockshutt were presented; a deputation of Indian chiefs\r\nfrom British Columbia was received by him on August 13th and submitted\r\nan address and a petition; a number of shire-horses were lent by His\r\nMajesty in the autumn for exhibition at Toronto and as a proof of his\r\ninterest in that branch of Canadian development. But the chief event of\r\nthe year in this respect was Canada's invitation to the King, and Queen\r\nAlexandra, to pay the country and its people a visit. In the House of\r\nCommons on April 18th, the Hon. N. A. Belcourt, seconded by Mr. W. B.\r\nNorthrup, moved a Resolution expressive of Canadian loyalty and devotion\r\nto the King's person and of the hope that His Majesty and the Queen\r\nwould be pleased to visit Canada at such time as might be found possible\r\nand convenient.\r\n\r\nIn his short speech the Prime Minister laid stress upon the King's\r\npersonal qualities and his work in the cause of peace. Sir Wilfrid\r\nLaurier then made a reference which was probably of more consequence in\r\nthe final decision than was supposed at the time, \"I believe it is the\r\nopinion of all who sit in this House that if the King were to visit\r\nCanada--and he could not visit Canada without visiting the United States\r\nalso--the effect would be to bring more closely together than they are\r\nat the present time--and they are more so than ever before--the two\r\ngreat branches of the Anglo-Saxon race on both sides of the Atlantic.\"\r\nThis additional suggestion involved tremendous considerations of travel,\r\nfunctions, ceremonial, time, and responsibility. After being spoken to\r\nby men of such opposite opinions as Colonel S. Hughes and Mr. H.\r\nBourassa, as well as warmly endorsed by the Opposition Leader, the\r\nResolution was passed unanimously, as it was later in the Senate. All\r\nthe Provincial Legislatures, then in session, joined in this invitation,\r\nwhile centres such as Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Winnipeg, Quebec, Three\r\nRivers, St. Hyacinthe, Valleyfield, Hamilton, London, Guelph, Woodstock,\r\nHalifax, Sydney, St. John, Fredericton, Regina, Calgary, Vancouver,\r\nVictoria and about forty others warmly endorsed the request; as did\r\nevery newspaper of standing in Canada. In reply Lord Elgin, Colonial\r\nSecretary, under date of July 7th wrote a long despatch to the\r\nGovernor-General in which he expressed the King's appreciation of the\r\ninvitation, his pleasant memories of the Royal visit to Canada in 1860,\r\nand his comprehension of the wonderful growth of the country since that\r\ntime, and continued:\r\n\r\n     \"I need scarcely remind Your Lordship of two circumstances which\r\n     must not be overlooked in the consideration of these proposals. In\r\n     the first place the current business of the Empire, which is\r\n     continuous and incessant, imposes a heavy tax on the time and\r\n     strength of its Sovereign and it is well known that the absence of\r\n     His Majesty from this country for any length of time is difficult,\r\n     if not impossible except under very definite limitations and\r\n     restrictions; even when considerations of health and the need for\r\n     comparative rest can render it expedient. In the second place it\r\n     must be remembered that there can be practically no limits within\r\n     the habitable globe of the distance which must be traveled to reach\r\n     all parts of the British Empire and that it would be very difficult\r\n     to visit one important part and decline to visit the other. In\r\n     spite of the many and strong inducements which prompt him to\r\n     gratify the loyal wishes of his Canadian subjects, I am to say that\r\n     the King feels unable at present to entertain the idea of a journey\r\n     to Canada.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be quite impossible to indicate here the great regret expressed\r\nby the Canadian press, and the people generally, at this result of the\r\ninvitation. Many reasons were adduced, other than those given in the\r\ndespatch, and including diplomatic requirements in Europe, Royal visits\r\nand delicate negotiations then pending, Eastern troubles and\r\ncomplications, Australian jealousy if omitted from such a tour, as well\r\nas the difficulties involved in any possible visit to the United States.\r\nDuring the year a full-length portrait of the King was received at\r\nGovernment House, Ottawa, painted by Luke Fildes, R.A., and the\r\nportraits of the King and Queen, specially painted by J. Colin Forbes,\r\nthe Canadian artist, were also received and hung in the Parliament\r\nHouses. In 1907 King Edward visited the Canadian pavilion at the Dublin\r\nExhibition of that year and inspected its exhibits while Queen Alexandra\r\naccepted from one of the Departments the gift of a rug made by\r\nFrench-Canadian women. In the next year much practical appreciation was\r\nshown in Canada of His Majesty's special arrangement under which the\r\n\"Life and Letters of Queen Victoria\" was offered for sale at a low\r\npopular price; a Royal cablegram of sympathy was sent to the sufferers\r\nby the Fernie (B. C.) fire; the Edward Medal, established by the King\r\nfor the recognition of courage in saving or trying to save life in\r\nquarries or mines, was extended to Canada and all parts of the Empire.\r\nIn the last year of his reign the King's third Derby victory was a\r\npopular one in Canada and throughout the Empire and his establishment of\r\na Police Medal for the recognition of \"exceptional service, heroism or\r\ndevotion to duty\" was also applied to Canada and all the British\r\nDominions. During the year His Majesty presented a gift of money to T.\r\nL. Wood, a blacksmith at Port Elgin, N. S., and accepted a horse-shoe of\r\nexquisite workmanship which had been wrought by him while lying on a\r\nsick-bed; visited and praised the exhibition of British Columbia fruit\r\nat Islington on December 6th.\r\n\r\nOn October 21, 1909, a Tuberculosis Institute, established at Montreal\r\nby Lieutenant-Colonel J. H. Burland, was opened by the King through\r\nspecial electric communication between the Library of West Dean Park,\r\nColchester, where he was staying, and the Institute at Montreal, with a\r\ncablegram which read as follows: \"I have much pleasure in declaring the\r\nRoyal Edward Institute at Montreal now open. The means by which I make\r\nthis declaration testifies to the power of modern science and I am\r\nconfident that the future history of the Institute will afford equally\r\nstriking testimony to the beneficent results of that power when applied\r\nto the conquest of disease and the relief of human suffering. I shall\r\nalways take a lively interest in the Institute and I pray that the\r\nblessing of the Almighty may rest upon all those who work in and for it\r\nand also upon those for whom it works. Edward R. & I.\" On November 20th\r\nHis Majesty sent a personal despatch to Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the\r\nfollowing terms: \"Let me express my hearty congratulations to you on the\r\nanniversary of your birthday. I hope you will be spared for many years\r\nto come to serve the Crown and Empire, Edward.\" The Premier replied with\r\nan expression of \"humble duty and deep gratitude.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nThe King as a Diplomatist and Peace-Maker.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the olden days Kings used to very often be their own Generals; in\r\nthese modern times King Edward has set an example by means of which they\r\nmay well be their own Ambassadors. He had every qualification of\r\ncapacity, intellect and trained experience to serve him in such\r\nconditions. If Queen Victoria, remaining very largely at home, could\r\nwield an immense and undoubted personal influence in Europe, partly\r\nbecause of an ability which made the late Lord Tennyson describe her as\r\n\"the greatest statesman in Europe\" and the Earl of Rosebery say that in\r\nmatters of foreign policy she advised her Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\nmore then he advised her,[7] how much more was King Edward entitled to\r\npersonal _prestige_ in Europe and fitted for diplomatic work amongst its\r\nrulers. His Royal Mother had known many Sovereigns and seen many Kings\r\nand statesmen come and go; he had also met and known many of them more\r\nintimately than she could possibly do in the semi-seclusion of her quiet\r\nCourt. He was uncle to the German Emperor, the mother of the Russian\r\nCzar was Queen Alexandra's sister, the King of Norway was a son of Queen\r\nAlexandra's brother the King of Denmark, the King of Spain was married\r\nto his niece and King George of Greece was his wife's brother. Even more\r\nimportant were the friendships which, as Prince of Wales, the King had\r\nmade in all the Courts of Europe, the statesmen whom he knew like a\r\nbook, the policies of which he understood the origin and every detail of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 King Edward had received the German Emperor in England and had\r\nentertained other visiting monarchs and statesmen and diplomats. Early\r\nin 1903 he visited Rome, was received by His Holiness, the Pope, and by\r\nthe King of Italy, and managed the difficult situation of the moment\r\nwith a delicacy and tact which prevented even a hint of unpleasantness;\r\nand served to greatly increase the traditional friendship of Italy and\r\nBritain while sending a glow of appreciation throughout the Roman\r\nCatholic world which lives under the British flag, and helping to settle\r\ntroubles which had arisen in Malta between the Government and the\r\nItalian residents. A little later he was in Portugal and proved a prime\r\nfactor in promoting an understanding in Lisbon which substantially\r\nfacilitated arrangements at far-away Delagoa Bay which, in turn, were of\r\ngreat advantage to South Africa. Then, on May 1st, came his famous visit\r\nto Paris and the commencement of an era of new and better feeling. It\r\nwas not an easy task or one entirely without risk. French sentiment had\r\nbeen greatly excited during the South African war, the Parisian populace\r\nhad not been friendly to Britain, the press had, at times, been grossly\r\nabusive and relations were undoubtedly strained. Through all the formal\r\nceremonies of this visit, however, the King showed his usual tact and\r\npowers of conciliation. A difficult situation was successfully met;\r\nill-feeling engendered by the misrepresentations of the War period were\r\ngreatly ameliorated; the friendly settlement of controversial questions\r\nrendered probable. In his speech to the British Chamber of Commerce in\r\nParis, on May 1st, His Majesty touched the key-note of the visit:\r\n\r\n     \"A Divine Providence has designed that France should be our near\r\n     neighbour and I hope always a dear friend. There are no two\r\n     countries in the world whose mutual prosperity is more dependent\r\n     upon each other. There may have been misunderstandings and causes\r\n     of dissension in the past but all such differences are, I believe,\r\n     happily removed and forgotten, and I trust that the friendship and\r\n     admiration which we all feel for the French nation and their\r\n     glorious traditions may in the near future develop into a sentiment\r\n     of the warmest affection and attachments between the peoples of the\r\n     two countries. The achievement of this aim is my constant desire.\"\r\n\r\nSuch an incident, followed by the cordial expressions of the French\r\npress and by a visible _rapprochement_ between the two countries, could\r\nnot but be of special interest to the French-Canadians of Quebec.\r\nNaturally monarchists at heart, the incident seemed to increase the\r\npersonal loyalty already existing there. The Toronto _Globe_ of April\r\n20, 1903, voiced a strong feeling in Canada when it hoped for a future\r\nRoyal visit to the Dominion and declared that \"it would be a mistake to\r\nsuppose that Edward VII. is merely an urbane gentleman, not to say a\r\nlover of the common people; he is a statesman and diplomat of breadth of\r\nview, depth of insight, and quickness of intuition. He knows how to time\r\nhis visits in the interest of the peace of the world for which he\r\nhumanely and seriously labours.\" From July 6th to 9th President Loubet\r\nof France was the guest of the King and his reception in London tended\r\nto still further promote good feeling. On October 14th came the\r\nsignature of an Arbitration Treaty between England and France. In this\r\nconnection much praise was accorded to the King as one of the chief\r\nfactors in its evolution. Mr. W. R. Cremer, M.P., the well-known\r\nRadical, made the following comment in the _Daily News_ as to this\r\nvictory for Arbitration: \"It has been the privilege and joy of others to\r\ndo the spade work in this beneficent movement, but to King Edward the\r\nopportunity was, at the psychological moment, presented to complete the\r\nwork of thirty years. How well and how nobly His Majesty performed his\r\npart the history of the past nine months clearly shows. Indeed, the King\r\nseems likely to distinguish himself by efforts of a character not\r\nrecorded in the reigns of any other English or Foreign monarch.\"\r\nAddressing a British Parliamentary Delegation to Paris on November 26th,\r\nthe Premier, M. Combes, eulogized King Edward and toasted him as the\r\nsovereign to whom they owed the treaty. At the annual banquet of the\r\nBritish Chamber of Commerce in Paris on December 3d, its president, Mr.\r\nO. E. Bodington, made a similar reference to the King. To the Montreal\r\n_Witness_ on December 7th, Senator Dandurand, who had just returned from\r\nEngland, paid the following French-Canadian tribute to His Majesty: \"The\r\nKing is the most popular crowned head in Europe to-day. He is beloved at\r\nhome, he is admired and praised in France, he is respected by every\r\nPower on the Continent.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Continental tour of 1903 by King Edward did more than effect\r\ngreat results in France. The signing of a Treaty of Arbitration with\r\nItaly in January, 1904, with Spain in March, and with Germany on July\r\n12th--following upon the King's visit to Berlin in June--were supposed\r\nto be largely due to His Majesty's personal influence with the rulers of\r\nthose countries and to a popularity with the masses which, in two cases\r\nat least, helped greatly in soothing current animosities. On April 8th\r\nof this year a Treaty was signed with France, in addition to the\r\nArbitration Treaty already mentioned, which disposed of all outstanding\r\nand long-standing subjects of dispute and as to which, while Lord\r\nLansdowne was the negotiator, King Edward was a most potent factor.\r\nUnder this arrangement Egypt was freed from foreign control and\r\npractically admitted to be British territory, while Newfoundland was\r\nfinally relieved of its coast troubles and conflicts of a century. On\r\nNovember 9th, preceding, Sir W. McGregor, Governor of Newfoundland,\r\nhad, during a banquet at St. John's, conveyed a personal message from\r\nthe King which assured the people of that colony of his earnest\r\nendeavours to promote a settlement of the French Shore question. To\r\nCanada this matter was also one of the most vital importance, because of\r\nits large French population. In the controversy with Russia over the\r\nHull fishing fleet outrage of October 23, 1904, which so nearly plunged\r\nthe Empire into a great war, it may be said that the King's influence,\r\ncoupled with the statecraft of Lord Lansdowne, as exhibited in the\r\nlatter's historic speech of November 9th, alone held the dogs of war in\r\nleash. The remark of a member of the Trades' Union Congress at Leeds on\r\nSeptember 7th of this year that in his opinion \"King Edward was about\r\nthe only statesman that England possessed\" was significant in this\r\nconnection even if it was unfair. Still more significant was the\r\ndescription of His Majesty in the Radical _News_ of London, on November\r\n10th, as \"the first citizen of the world and the chief Minister of\r\nPeace.\"\r\n\r\nDuring 1905 King Edward continued his public services along these lines\r\nof international statecraft. On April 30th he paid an unofficial visit\r\nto Paris, accompanied by the Marquess of Salisbury as Minister in\r\nattendance. A great banquet was given at the Elysée by President Loubet\r\nand there followed a general press discussion of the _entente_ between\r\nEngland and France. In June the King of Spain visited England and at a\r\nstate banquet given by King Edward at Buckingham Palace, on June 6th,\r\nthe latter said: \"Spain and England have often been allies; may they\r\nalways remain so; and above all march together for the benefit of peace,\r\nprogress and the civilization of mankind.\" On August 7th a French fleet\r\narrived in the Solent and its men fraternized with those of the British\r\ncruiser squadron while the King gave a banquet on board the Royal yacht\r\nto the chief French officers. On the following day His Majesty reviewed\r\ntwo fleets which together made a splendid aggregation of seventy\r\nwarships; while the press of the civilized world commented upon the new\r\nfriendship of the two nations and very largely credited King Edward with\r\nthe achievement.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1907 the King's visit of two months' duration in Europe did\r\nmore service in the cause of international friendliness; later on the\r\nGerman Emperor visited England, as did the King and Queen of Denmark,\r\nand the King and Queen of Portugal. In June a triple agreement was\r\nconcluded between Great Britain, France and Spain for the joint\r\nprotection of their mutual interests in the Mediterranean and on the\r\nAtlantic. This arrangement and the improved relations with Germany were\r\ncredited largely to the efforts of King Edward, just as the _entente\r\ncordiale_ with France had previously been conceded to be greatly due to\r\nhis tact and popularity. In October he was able to crown his work by\r\naccepting a Convention with Russia which dealt primarily with the\r\naffairs of Persia, Afghanistan and Thibet, but really made future war\r\nbetween the two Powers a matter of difficulty. The year 1908 saw state\r\nvisits to Copenhagen, Stockholm and Christiana in April; the King's\r\nopening of the Franco-British Exhibition in London on May 26th and\r\nreception of President Fallières of France; his visit, with Queen\r\nAlexandra and a large suite, to Russia--the first of the kind in British\r\nhistory--and a meeting with the Czar at Revel on June 8th; his\r\nconference with the German Emperor at Cronberg on August 11th and with\r\nthe Austrian Emperor at Ischl on the 12th. During the last year of his\r\nreign, King Edward's personal intercourse and diplomatic meetings with\r\nother rulers were undoubtedly conducive to continued peace and to better\r\nmutual understandings. His Majesty met the German Emperor at Berlin on\r\nFebruary 8, 1909, the French President at Paris on March 6th, the King\r\nof Spain at Biarritz on March 31st, the King of Italy on April 29th, the\r\nEmperor of Russia at Cowes on August 2d. Just as Britain was an\r\nAmerican Power at this time because of Canada, an Asiatic Power because\r\nof India and an African Power because of many possessions, so Canada was\r\nan European Power because of its connection with Great Britain, and\r\nAustralia an Eastern Power because of its proximity to China and Japan,\r\nand a European Power because of the nearness of Germany in New Guinea\r\nand of France in New Caledonia. Hence, to all these countries and for\r\nobvious reasons of common interest, the importance in an Empire sense of\r\nthe King's personality and diplomacy during these years.\r\n\r\nKing Edward's training was of a nature which fitted into his personal\r\ncharacteristics in this respect. His Royal mother had cultivated his\r\nboyhood memory for faces and names most carefully; from the days of his\r\nyouth he was thoroughly conversant with many foreign languages; from his\r\ncoming of age he was in constant touch with the best of British and\r\nEuropean leaders. He had not reached maturity before experiencing the\r\ndifficulties of a tour of Canada and the United States in days when\r\nthere was no royal road mapped out by precedent for the management of\r\nthe tour and at a time when Orange and Green were in frequent conflict\r\nin the British-American provinces and feelings of international\r\nkindliness were not quite so strong in the United States as they were at\r\nthe close of his reign. In 1876 he had toured India amidst gorgeous\r\nceremonial and amid an infinite variety of racial and religious\r\noccasions, or incidents, which only rare tact could successfully meet.\r\nHow much exercise there was of this Royal statecraft behind the scenes\r\nduring his nine years of sovereignty only the distant future can reveal\r\nand then but partially. His Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs,\r\nLord Salisbury, Lord Lansdowne and Sir Edward Grey, were all men of\r\nexceptional capacity and rare experience.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, in view of the broad statecraft and high standing of\r\nthese Ministers and the uniformity of policy which they pursued, that\r\nadvice was frequently given by the King and consultations continuously\r\nheld. They were only too glad, as was Lord Rosebery during the late\r\nQueen's reign, to benefit personally by his knowledge and experience;\r\nthey were only too happy that the Nation and other nations should\r\nbenefit by his tactful conduct of delicate negotiations with monarchs\r\nand rulers abroad. The alliance with Japan may or may not stand to his\r\ncredit; the probabilities are that it does, in part at least. It\r\nsafeguarded British interests in the East, checkmated the, at that time,\r\ndangerous ambitions of Russia, put up a barrier against certain efforts\r\nof Germany. The French _entente cordiale_ and subsequent treaties gave\r\nBritish interests in the Mediterranean and Northern Africa an ally\r\nagainst German plans and settled the Newfoundland troubles while\r\nsolidifying Britain's position in Egypt. Italy was partially separated\r\nfrom its German alliance; Spain was brought close to Britain by the\r\nyoung King's marriage with the Princess Ena; Russia was swung into the\r\ncircle of a friendship which not even the Japanese alliance has broken;\r\nNorway made King Edward's son-in-law its King. If Germany did not become\r\none of this circle of friendly nations it was not due to any lack of\r\ndiplomacy, or effort, or desire on the part of the British Sovereign; it\r\nwas because of national ambitions and an aggressive personal leadership\r\nby the Kaiser which had other ends in view. Nominally, at any rate, the\r\nfriendly relations existed, and it is safe to say that there was no\r\ngreater admirer of King Edward's character and statecraft in Europe than\r\nthe Emperor William.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Personal statements made to the writer of these pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nThe Death of King Edward\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been rumours flying around London early in 1910 as to the\r\nKing's health, but it would seem that only a limited circle understood\r\nthat, while there was no serious disease involved, there was a general\r\nweakness of the system which rendered great care necessary and made it\r\neasy to see danger in any otherwise trifling illness. Occasional\r\ncablegrams to this Continent were largely disregarded and looked upon as\r\nmore or less sensational and little was thought of the attack of\r\nbronchitis at Biarritz in March. There seems small reason to doubt that\r\nthe political situation hastened the end though it did not actually\r\ncause the sad event. The conditions of weakness were there; the worry of\r\na great and urgent responsibility was added to the King's normal work\r\nand subjects of thought. Though the constitutional crisis was probably\r\nnot as serious as the press and politicians made out, it must\r\nundoubtedly have had its effect upon a ruler conscientiously devoted to\r\nhis duty. On May 5th, it was announced that the King was again ill with\r\nbronchitis and that his condition caused \"some anxiety;\" a few hours\r\nafterwards it was officially stated that \"grave anxiety\" was felt; on\r\nMay 6th, near midnight, there came the sorrowful announcement of his\r\nphysicians that the King had passed away in the presence of Queen\r\nAlexandra, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Princess Royal [Duchess\r\nof Fife], Princess Victoria and the Princess Louise [Duchess of Argyll].\r\n\r\nSo unexpected was any serious or immediate issue of His Majesty's\r\ncondition that the Queen was still on the Continent when he was taken\r\nill and the King himself was transacting state business in an arm-chair\r\nthe day before he died. A pathetic incident of the latter date was the\r\nbearing of the well-known purple and gold colours to victory at Kempton\r\nPark Races by \"The Witch of the Air.\" When the news came it was hard to\r\nbelieve. People throughout the Empire were entirely unprepared. In\r\nBritain, Canada, Australia, etc., public functions and social\r\narrangements were at once cancelled; black and purple drapings rapidly\r\ncovered the important buildings--and many that were even more important\r\nas representing individual and spontaneous feeling--of the British\r\nworld; mourning was seen everywhere in the United Kingdom and to a\r\nlesser extent in the other countries; papers appeared universally draped\r\nin black. In Canada, H. E. the Governor-General cabled to Lord Crewe an\r\nofficial expression of regret--one which was real as well as official:\r\n\"The announcement of the death of King Edward VII, which has just\r\nreached Canada, has created universal sorrow. His Majesty's Canadian\r\nMinisters desire that you will convey to His Majesty, King George, and\r\nthe members of the Royal family, an assurance that the people of Canada\r\nshare in the great grief that has visited them. In discharge of the\r\nduties of his exalted station His late Majesty not only won the respect\r\nand devotion of all British subjects, but by his efforts on behalf of\r\ninternational harmony and good-will he became universally esteemed as a\r\ngreat Peacemaker. Nowhere was this gracious attribute of Royal character\r\nmore deeply appreciated than in His Majesty's Dominion of Canada.\"\r\n\r\nEvery kind of loyal tribute was paid to the late King by the Press and\r\nin the pulpit of all the countries concerned, while from the United\r\nStates came expressions of admiration and respect very little short of\r\nthose dictated by the natural loyalty and knowledge of his own subjects.\r\nIn Canada the Premiers of the Provinces were amongst the first to\r\nexpress their feelings. At Quebec Sir Lomer Gouin, supported by the\r\nOpposition Leader, moved the adjournment of the Legislature on May 6th:\r\n\"Those who love in a Chief of State the greatest qualities, peace,\r\ngoodness, nobility and _entente cordiale_, all feel his loss. It is for\r\nthat reason that we cannot do otherwise than suspend our sittings, and I\r\nam convinced that all the Members of this House will endorse this\r\nproposal for adjournment.\"\r\n\r\nIn Toronto Sir James Whitney, the Provincial Premier, declared that \"it\r\nwould be difficult to express the feeling of love, respect, and\r\nadmiration entertained by British peoples for their late sovereign, who\r\nin his comparatively short reign, has so borne himself and has so done\r\nhis part, that the whole human race has participated in the benefit\r\nresulting from the wisdom shown by him. Probably no wiser monarch ever\r\nreigned over a nation.\" To the New Brunswick press the local Premier,\r\nHon. Douglas Hazen, said: \"King Edward's reign was a comparatively short\r\none, but the verdict of history will undoubtedly be that he was one of\r\nthe wisest and greatest rulers that ever sat upon a throne. He took a\r\nmost keen and active interest in all his country's institutions,\r\nendeavouring at all times to promote the well-being of his subjects and\r\nto show his appreciation of the British Dominions beyond the Seas.\" The\r\nHon. A. K. Maclean, Acting-Premier of Nova Scotia, stated that \"to his\r\npacific tendencies and his powerful mediation is due the existence of\r\nfriendly relations between Great Britain and other nations and the\r\nremoval of many long-standing differences and historic prejudices.\" The\r\nConservative leader at Ottawa, Mr. R. L. Borden, gave eloquent\r\nexpression to his feelings:\r\n\r\n     \"The tidings of sorrow which have just been flashed across the\r\n     ocean come to the people of Canada with startling suddenness.\r\n     Words of foreboding had hardly reached us before the last message\r\n     came; 'God's finger touched him and he slept.' To the people of the\r\n     overseas Dominions the Crown personifies the dignity and majesty of\r\n     the whole Empire; and through the Throne each great Dominion is\r\n     linked to the others and to the Motherland. Thus the Sovereign's\r\n     death must always thrill the Empire. But to-day's untimely tidings\r\n     bring to the people of Canada the sense of a still deeper and more\r\n     personal bereavement. They gloried in their King's title of\r\n     Peacemaker, and they believed him to be the greatest living force\r\n     for right within the Empire. In him died the greatest statesman and\r\n     diplomat of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hon. R. Lemieux, Postmaster-General and a Liberal leader in Quebec,\r\nadded this succinct description: \"As a peacemaker and as a\r\nconstitutional king he had no equal in the history of modern times.\" He\r\nexpressed the hope that \"in the common sorrow of his subjects at the\r\ndeath of an exemplary Sovereign the ties making for unity and common\r\ninterest throughout the Empire may be strengthened and his influence for\r\ngood find continued fruition.\" The Hon. G. P. Graham, Minister of\r\nRailways, also touched on the Empire thought: \"His part in the growth\r\nand increasing solidarity of the Empire in matters of defense, of trade,\r\nof common effort for the common interest, must bulk large in history.\r\nSince his assumption of the throne there has been a steady growth in\r\nCanada's loyalty to the Sovereign based on esteem for his personal\r\ncharacter, confidence in his judgment and statesmanship, and pride in\r\nhis commanding position among the world's sovereigns.\" From Mr. Richard\r\nMcBride, Premier of far-away British Columbia, came the declaration that\r\nKing Edward was infinitely tactful and always patient, the first\r\ngentleman and best beloved monarch of his time; that he was \"an\r\nunusually gifted ruler who performed unostentatiously and with inspired\r\nability his part in the making of British history.\" To Archbishop\r\nBruchési of Montreal he was \"a great and good King;\" to the Rev. Dr.\r\nCarman, Canada's Methodist leader, he was \"royally born and ruled\r\nroyally over a free, loyal and loving people;\" to Archbishop McEvay\r\n(Roman Catholic) of Toronto he was a ruler \"trusted and loved by all his\r\nsubjects;\" to President R. A. Falconer, of Toronto University, there was\r\na special appeal in his \"experience, sympathy and broad humanity.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no need to largely quote the tributes of Britain, Australia or\r\nSouth Africa. Their people thought and felt and acted as Canada's did.\r\nGreat Britain felt the loss, of course, in a more strictly personal\r\nsense than the Dominions beyond the Seas. The reverent crowds with bared\r\nheads, and every sign of severe personal grief, standing outside\r\nBuckingham Palace grounds could hardly be exactly duplicated abroad,\r\nthough the scenes in countless churches, as memorial sermons were\r\ndelivered and memorial services held amidst tokens of obvious and\r\nsincere sorrow, came very near to it. In particular, was the open-air\r\nservice in Toronto facing the Parliament Buildings and attended by\r\nsilent masses of people, with respectful and sympathetic addresses, with\r\ndrapings and evidences of mourning on every hand, with the solemn\r\nstrains of muffled music from many bands, and the presence of thousands\r\nof loyal troops, an indication of the popular feeling shown throughout\r\nthe Dominion on May 20th, which was appointed to be a day of mourning, a\r\nholiday of sorrow for the people. But this is anticipating. Perhaps, in\r\nEngland, the tribute of Mr. Premier Asquith, at the special meeting of\r\nParliament on May 11th, was most significant of the innumerable tributes\r\nof earnest loyalty and appreciation expressed at the passing of one who\r\nwas not only a great King but a much-loved personality.\r\n\r\nAfter pointing out the nature of events in recent years, the growth of\r\ninternational friendships and new understandings and stronger safeguards\r\nfor peace, together with the ever-tightening bonds of corporate unity\r\nwithin the British realms, Mr. Asquith went on to say that: \"In all\r\nthese multiform manifestations of national and Imperial life, the\r\nhistory of the world will assign a part of singular dignity to the great\r\nruler Great Britain has lost. In external affairs King Edward's powerful\r\ninfluence was directed not only to the avoidance of war, but to the\r\ncauses of and pretexts of war, and he well earned the title by which he\r\nwill always be remembered, the Peace-maker of the World.\" Continuing,\r\nthe Premier said, that within the boundaries of the Empire his late\r\nMajesty, by his broad and elastic sympathies, had won a degree of\r\nloyalty and affectionate confidence which few Sovereigns had ever\r\nenjoyed. \"Here at home,\" he added, \"all recognized that above the din\r\nand dust of their hard-fought controversies, detached from party, and\r\nattached only to the common interest, they had in the late King an\r\narbiter ripe in experience, judicial in temper, and at once a reverent\r\nworshipper of their traditions, and a watchful guardian of their\r\nconstitutional liberties.\" King Edward's life as a devotee of duty, as a\r\nsportsman in the best sense of the word, as an ardent and discriminating\r\npatron of the arts, as a good business man at the head of a great\r\nbusiness community, possessed of intuitive shrewdness in the management\r\nof men and difficult situations, as a keen social reformer with \"no self\r\napart from his people,\" was then dwelt upon. It would be impossible in\r\nany limited space to analyze the views of the British press. The _Times_\r\ndeclared that \"his people loved him for his honesty and kindly courtesy.\r\nTo all he was not merely every inch a King but every inch an English\r\nKing and an English gentleman. His influence was not the same as that of\r\nQueen Victoria, but in some respects it was almost stronger.\" The _Daily\r\nMail_ considered that \"to his initiative his subjects and the Empire\r\nowe the pacification of South Africa and the final reconciliation with\r\nthe Boers. The system of understandings with foreign powers which is our\r\nsecurity to-day was in a great part his handiwork.\" To the Radical\r\n_Daily News_ he was \"the supreme example of a people's King by common\r\nconsent\" and this the Liberal _Morning Leader_ echoed with a further\r\ntribute to \"the sheer instinctive deference paid to his proved wisdom,\r\nhis large-minded statesmanship, his unequaled knowledge of the world,\r\nand the tact that never failed him in the greatest or the least\r\noccasion.\"\r\n\r\nA notable incident of this first week of mourning, during which the\r\npeople were waiting to pay their final tribute of loyal sympathy on the\r\nday of the Royal interment, was the unanimous Resolution of the\r\nLegislature of Quebec. Coming from a French-Canadian people, amongst\r\nwhom special interest had been aroused by King Edward's creation of the\r\n_entente cordiale_ with France, something earnest and sympathetic as\r\nwell as loyal in expression might have been expected and, if so, the\r\nhope was certainly realized. The Legislature in its address to King\r\nGeorge V. (May 10th) put the feelings of the people of the Province in\r\nthe following expressive words:\r\n\r\n     \"We mourn the loss in him of a monarch whose chief aim was to draw\r\n     all the nations closer together and to promote universal peace.\r\n     Ever mindful of the great principles of the British constitution,\r\n     through his broad-mindedness, his tolerance, and the exquisite\r\n     charm of his personality, he succeeded in creating a potent bond of\r\n     union between the various parts of our common country, and in\r\n     closely consolidating the different branches of the greatest Empire\r\n     that ever existed. Representing as we do the Province of Quebec it\r\n     gives us pleasure to recall that the development of the idea of a\r\n     powerful Canadian nation, devoted to the interest of the\r\n     Mother-Country, was favoured by that great King. Imbued with the\r\n     grandeur and nobility of his mission he won our admiration and our\r\n     love through his solicitude in respecting our laws and our dearest\r\n     traditions, aspirations and liberties.\"\r\n\r\nThe individual utterances of the Ministers were equally patriotic in\r\nterms. Sir Lomer Gouin spoke along the lines of his earlier tribute and\r\ndeclared that King Edward's reign had been \"a glory to his people and a\r\nblessing to humanity.\" Mr. J. M. Tellier, the Opposition leader, joined\r\nthe Premier in expressing the \"confidence and sincere affection\" of his\r\npeople for this \"the most powerful King of the most powerful of Empires\"\r\nand in presenting to the new King \"the allegiance, the faith and the\r\nheartfelt wishes of Canadians.\" Mr. H. Bourassa, the Nationalist\r\nrepresentative, Hon. P. S. G. Mackenzie, the English-speaking member of\r\nthe Cabinet, and Hon. J. C. Kaine and Hon. C. R. Devlin, the Irish\r\nMinisters, joined in these tributes.\r\n\r\nThe view of Foreign countries was unique in its friendliness, in its\r\nexpressions of admiration for the great qualities of heart and head in\r\nthe late Sovereign, for appreciation of his broad sympathies and\r\ninternational statecraft. One of the earliest official telegrams of\r\nsympathy to King George was from President Fallières of France: \"I\r\nlearnt with emotion of the death of your beloved Father. The French\r\nGovernment and the French people will regret profoundly the demise of\r\nthe august Sovereign who upon so many occasions has given them evidence\r\nof his sincere friendship; and associate themselves fully in the great\r\ngrief which his unexpected loss brings to you, the Royal family, and the\r\nentire British Empire. It is with a heart full of sadness that I ask\r\nYour Royal Highness to accept my personal condolences, those of the\r\nFrench Government and of all France.\" From the President of the United\r\nStates came a prompt message of condolence to Queen Alexandra, and from\r\nthe American Congress a unanimous Resolution of adjournment and\r\nexpressive words of sympathy with the British people \"in the loss of a\r\nwise and upright ruler whose great purpose was the cultivation of\r\nfriendly relations with all nations and the preservation of peace\"; from\r\nex-President Roosevelt, speaking at Stockholm on May 8th, came words of\r\nregret and of regard for the people \"who mourn the loss of a wise ruler\r\nwhose sole thought was for their welfare and for the good of mankind,\r\nand the citizens of other nations can join with them in mourning for a\r\nman who showed throughout his term of Kingship that his voice was always\r\nraised for justice and peace among the nations.\"\r\n\r\nFrom United States newspapers, the exponents of public opinion in a\r\ngreat kindred nation, came a wonderfully unanimous and kindly expression\r\nof real feeling. To the New York _Herald_ the late King appeared as\r\nblessed with \"a genial personality, a kind heart and a strong common\r\nsense, together with that highest quality of supreme importance in a\r\nruler and statesman--tact\"; to the Buffalo _News_ King Edward was \"the\r\nablest Royal ruler England has known in centuries;\" to the Baltimore\r\n_American_ \"he was, and the world to-day generously accords him the\r\ndistinction, the first diplomatist of his time, the man who beyond all\r\nothers shaped the policies of the world.\" To the Indianapolis _News_ he\r\nhad \"served his country and the world wisely and well, and will go into\r\nhistory as one of the most successful monarchs that England has ever\r\nhad.\" The New York _Journal of Commerce_ paid special and high tribute\r\nto King Edward's diplomacy and, after dealing with the French _entente\r\ncordiale_ went on as follows: \"Even more marvelous than the closing of\r\nthe secular feud with France was the termination of that with Russia,\r\nwhich seemed more bitter and more hopeless of adjustment. The seemingly\r\nimpossible was, nevertheless, accomplished, and the power which but a\r\nfew short years before had been the chief menace to the safety of\r\nBritish India became one of the guarantors of its immunity from attack.\r\nIt will be reckoned one of the miracles of history that Russia could\r\nhave been induced to abandon a policy which she had steadfastly\r\nsupported and been ready to concede that the affairs of Afghanistan were\r\npurely a British interest and those of Korea exclusively Japanese.\"\r\n\r\nIn most of these tributes of regard and respect--British, Imperial or\r\nForeign--there was a reference of affectionate admiration for the Queen\r\nConsort who, at this moment, allowed it to be understood that she would\r\nlike in future to be known as the Queen Mother. The far-famed beauty of\r\nperson, the charm and graciousness of manner, and nobility of mind and\r\ncharacter, which had won a way so quickly and permanently into the\r\nhearts of the British people and had been such potent forces in the life\r\nof King Edward and of her own family, brought to Queen Alexandra at this\r\ntime a world-tribute of sympathy and regard. British subjects all over\r\nthe Empire, multitudes outside of its bounds, were ready to echo those\r\nfamous words of Lord Tennyson, applied to the similar sorrow of Queen\r\nVictoria:\r\n\r\n                        May all love,\r\n    His love, unseen but felt, o'ershadow Thee,\r\n    The love of all Thy sons encompass Thee\r\n    The Love of all Thy Daughters cherish Thee\r\n    The Love of all Thy people comfort Thee\r\n    Till God's love set Thee at his side again.\r\n\r\nFew more touching words have been written than the Queen's Message to\r\nthe Nation which was made public on May 10th: \"From the depth of my poor\r\nbroken heart,\" she wrote, \"I wish to express to the whole Nation and our\r\nown kind people we love so well, my deep-felt thanks for all their\r\ntouching sympathy in my overwhelming sorrow and unspeakable anguish. Not\r\nalone have I lost everything in him, my beloved husband, but the nation,\r\ntoo, has suffered an irreparable loss in their best friend, father, and\r\nSovereign thus suddenly called away. May God give us all his Divine help\r\nto bear this heaviest of crosses which He has seen fit to lay upon us.\r\nHis will be done. Give to me a thought in your prayers which will\r\ncomfort and sustain me in all that I have to go through. Let me take\r\nthis opportunity of expressing my heartfelt thanks for all the touching\r\nletters and tokens of sympathy I have received from all classes, high\r\nand low, rich and poor, which are so numerous that I fear it would be\r\nimpossible for me ever to thank everybody individually. I confide my\r\ndear Son to your care, who I know, will follow in his dear Father's\r\nfootsteps, begging you to show him the same loyalty and devotion you\r\nshowed his dear Father. I know that both my dear son and daughter-in-law\r\nwill do their utmost to merit and keep it.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the surviving children of King Edward and Queen\r\nAlexandra at the time of the King's death were his successor--George\r\nFrederick Ernest Albert, Prince of Wales; Princess Louise, Duchess of\r\nFife, who was born in 1867 and married in 1889; Princess Victoria, who\r\nwas born in 1868 and was unmarried; Princess Maud, Queen of Norway, who\r\nwas born in 1869 and married in 1896 to Charles, then Crown Prince of\r\nDenmark. King Edward's only surviving brother was H. R. H., the Duke of\r\nConnaught, who was born in 1850. His surviving sisters were Princess\r\nHelena, married to Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; Princess\r\nLouise, married to the Duke of Argyll; and Princess Beatrice, widow of\r\nthe late Prince Henry of Battenberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nThe Solemn Funeral of the King\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of King Edward was an event of more than British importance,\r\nof more than Imperial significance. His funeral was a stately, solemn\r\nand splendid ceremony preceded by two weeks of real mourning throughout\r\nhis Empire, of obvious and sincere regret throughout the world. In\r\nLondon and Cape Town, in Melbourne and Toronto, in Wellington and Dawson\r\nCity, in Ottawa and Khartoum, in Calcutta and in Cairo; wherever the\r\nBritish flag flies, efforts were made to mark the funeral as one of\r\nindividual and local and national sorrow. All the great cities of the\r\nEmpire, the smaller towns, and even the hamlets, had their drapings of\r\npurple and black. In every church and chapel and Sunday meeting-house\r\nduring the two weeks of mourning at least one service was given up to\r\nthe memory of the late King. In all foreign countries preparations were\r\nmade for the formal expression of the general admiration which the\r\nqualities and reign of the dead monarch had aroused. Formal resolutions,\r\npublic meetings, the appointment of national representatives to the\r\ncoming funeral were world-wide incidents.\r\n\r\nAt home in London the casket to contain the Royal remains was fashioned\r\nof British oak from the Forest of Windsor and on May 14th, the body of\r\nKing Edward was removed from the room in which he died to the Throne\r\nRoom of Buckingham Palace, and there placed on a catafalque in front of\r\na temporary altar where it was guarded night and day by four Royal\r\nGrenadiers. On May 16th, amidst a solemn and imposing but preliminary\r\npageant the late King was carried from the Palace where he died to\r\nWestminster Hall, where the remains were to lie in solemn state. A\r\nfarewell family service had been held by the Bishop of London and then\r\nthe body at 11.30 in the morning was transported to its new\r\nresting-place between double lines of red-coated soldiers, flanked by\r\ndense and silent masses of mourning people, with buildings on every hand\r\nheavily draped.\r\n\r\nPreceded by the booming of minute guns, the slow pealing of bells and\r\nthe roll of muffled drums the procession passed to its destination. It\r\nincluded the Headquarters Staff of the Army with Lord Roberts leading,\r\nthe Admiralty Board, the great officers of Army and Navy, dismounted\r\ntroops, Indian officers. These preceded the plain gun-carriage on which\r\nrested the Royal remains, the coffin covered with a white satin pall and\r\nthe Royal Standard, on which rested the Crown, the Orb and the Sceptre.\r\nDrawn by eight magnificent black horses and flanked by the King's\r\nCompany of the Royal Grenadiers the bier was followed by King George on\r\nfoot with his two eldest sons and behind them were the Kings of Denmark\r\nand Norway, the Duke of Connaught, various visiting royalties, or\r\nrepresentatives, and the household of the late King. A mounted escort\r\nsucceeded and then came a carriage containing the Queen-Mother, her\r\nsister the Dowager Empress of Russia, the Princess Royal and Princess\r\nVictoria, another with Queen Mary, and others with the Queen of Norway\r\nand various members of the royal family. Last of all came a body of\r\nmounted troops. All along the route, which was scarcely half a mile in\r\nlength, the attitude of the uncounted multitude was one of deep personal\r\ngrief. No word was spoken and after heads had been uncovered, the masses\r\nof people were described as looking like an assembly of graven images.\r\nAt the noble Hall, famous in British history for more than 800 years,\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury and the Duke of Norfolk received the coffin\r\nand preceded it to the catafalque. No attempt at funeral decoration\r\nmarred the noble simplicity of the grand interior. The spacious floor\r\nwas laid with dull grey felt. In the centre, on a slightly elevated dais\r\nspread with a purple carpet stood the lofty purple draped catafalque. No\r\nflowing draperies softened its outlines and it appeared like smoothly\r\nchiselled blocks of purple granite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Above--The west front of Buckingham Palace, showing the\r\nwindows of the room in which King Edward died.

N. Y.]\r\n\r\nSlowly and quietly a great company assembled and then the Westminster\r\nAbbey choir of men and boys clad in white surplices and scarlet\r\ncassocks, took its position. On the left, preceded by the mace-bearer\r\nwith his glittering mace, came the Speaker of the House of Commons in\r\nhis flowing robes of black and gold, followed by 400 members of the same\r\nHouse led by the Prime Minister. All the members of the Cabinet were\r\nthere while Radical, Labour and Unionist members mingled behind the low\r\npurple barrier. A little later the Lord Chancellor, wearing his\r\nfull-bottomed wig and black and gold gown and preceded by the\r\nmace-bearer, led the Peers down the staircase in front of the choir to\r\nan enclosure on the right side of the catafalque. On bars immediately\r\nopposite each other rested the masses of the House of Commons and the\r\nHouse of Lords. Behind each there was arranged a nearly equal number of\r\nCommoners and Peers. Between them stood the catafalque. Presently, amid\r\na deep hush, great military and naval officers led the procession into\r\nthe hall. Proceeded by the Garter King-at-Arms, and Heralds they marched\r\nslowly and ranged themselves in a glittering array over the steps below\r\nthe choir while the coffin was borne in by soldiers. Behind it was\r\ncarried by other soldiers the covering of the coffin on which rested the\r\ncrown, sceptre and orb. Very gently the heavy coffin was raised to the\r\ncatafalque and the glittering emblems of royalty replaced on its top.\r\nThen, leaning on either side of the catafalque, and resting on the\r\nground, were placed two plain wreaths of cypress. Behind the coffin\r\nfollowed the Queen Alexandra, King George and the Dowager Empress Marie\r\nof Russia, each holding one of her arms. The purple carpeted dais was\r\noccupied by the dead King's family and royal visitors. A short service\r\nfollowed and the first part of the royal funeral was over while from the\r\nheart and pen of the great poet of the Empire--Rudyard Kipling--came\r\nverses addressed to and representing the people of which a few lines may\r\nbe quoted:\r\n\r\n    And God poured him an exquisite wine, that was daily renewed to him\r\n    In the clear welling love of his peoples, that daily accrued to him.\r\n    Honour and service we gave him, rejoicingly, fearless;\r\n    Faith absolute, trust beyond speech, and a friendship as peerless.\r\n    And since he was master and servant in all that we asked him\r\n    We leaned hard on his wisdom in all things, knowing not how we\r\n      tasked him.\r\n\r\n    For on him each new day laid command, every tyrannous hour\r\n    To confront, or confirm or make smooth some dread issue of power.\r\n    To deliver true judgment aright at the instant unaided\r\n    In the strict, level, ultimate phrase that allowed or dissuaded;\r\n    To foresee, to allay, to avert from us perils unnumbered;\r\n    To stand guard at our gates when he guessed that our watchman had\r\n      slumbered;\r\n    To win time, to turn hate, to woo folly to service, and mightily\r\n      schooling\r\n    His strength to the use of his nations; to rule as not ruling.\r\n    These were the works of our King; earth's peace is the proof of\r\n      them.\r\n    God gave him great works to fulfil and to use the behoof of them.\r\n\r\nFollowing these events Westminster Hall for two days was thrown open to\r\nthe public and a continuous procession of half a million mourners passed\r\nthe coffin and looked for the last time upon the face of their\r\nwell-loved Sovereign. Into Windsor, meanwhile, there poured innumerable\r\nevidences of the peoples' sympathy from the costliest tribute of wealth\r\nand aristocracy to the thousands of simple green wreaths sent in by the\r\npoorer classes. To Westminster Hall, on May 19th, the Emperor William of\r\nGermany, soon after his arrival, proceeded with King George, stood for a\r\nwhile in the private enclosure as the countless stream of people passed\r\nslowly by, then descended to the floor of the Hall--the Kaiser carrying\r\na wreath of purple and white flowers--and together knelt within the\r\nrails while the stream of passers-by was temporarily suspended. When the\r\ntwo monarchs arose the Emperor William held out his hand which King\r\nGeorge clasped and held for some moments.\r\n\r\nBy May 20th the preparations were all in readiness for the final\r\nfunctions and splendid ceremonial. The streets were draped from\r\nBuckingham Palace to Westminster Hall, and thence to Paddington Station,\r\nin great masses of purple and white and black; Venetian masts lined the\r\nroute on which hung masses of funeral wreaths from the people;\r\nhalf-masted flags were everywhere. The town of Windsor was almost buried\r\nfrom sight in the purple trappings of grief and royalty. On the day\r\nitself solemn, silent multitudes of men and women, estimated at from\r\nthree to five millions, were massed along the route of the procession\r\nwith 35,000 soldiers lining the streets and a parade which even London\r\nhad never equalled for mingled splendour and solemnity. At 9:10 a. m.,\r\nthe deep-toned bell of Westminster announced the beginning of the royal\r\nobsequies. King George, Queen Mary, the Queen Mother, the royal family\r\nand the visiting monarchs and representatives of the powers and the\r\nEmpire, left Buckingham Palace and proceeded with a small escort to\r\nWestminster Hall amidst the tolling of bells and the firing of minute\r\nguns. Only Queen Alexandra, the Princess Victoria, the King and the\r\nEmperor William entered the Hall and saw the body removed from the\r\ncatafalque to the gun-carriage outside where it rested under conditions\r\nsimilar to those of the earlier removal from Buckingham Palace. Outside,\r\nthe Queen Mother entered her coach and, as the body-guard of Kings\r\nwheeled around and passed her carriage, three by three, each saluted her\r\nwith silent reverence.\r\n\r\nThe procession left Westminster at 9.30 headed by a long column of\r\ntroops and bluejackets and the greater officers of the Army and Navy.\r\nBands of the Household cavalry, the new Territorial troops, Colonial\r\nsoldiers, were first and then came various volunteer corps, the\r\nHonourable Artillery Company, officers of the Indian regiments in their\r\npicturesque uniforms and turbans, followed by detachments of infantry,\r\nFoot Guards, Royal Engineers, Garrison, Field and Horse Artillery. Naval\r\nrepresentatives came next with the military attaches of the foreign\r\nembassies, the officers of the Headquarters Staff of the Army and the\r\nField Marshals and massed bands playing solemn funeral marches. Then\r\nfollowed the chief officers of State, followed by the Duke of Norfolk\r\nand succeeded by a single soldier carrying the Royal Standard; the\r\ngun-carriage carrying the mortal remains of the King came next and just\r\nbehind it walked a groom leading his favourite charger and another with\r\nhis favourite dog \"Caesar\"; King George followed, riding between the\r\nGerman Emperor and the Duke of Connaught, all clad in brilliant uniforms\r\nwith a long and unique line of nine Monarchs, Princes of great States\r\nand special Ambassadors and Imperial representatives. They rode in the\r\nfollowing order:\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Connaught, King George and the Emperor William.\r\n\r\nKing Haakon of Norway, King George of Greece, and King Alfonso of Spain.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand of Bulgaria, King Frederick of Denmark and King Manuel of\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\nPrince Yussof Zvyeden, the Heir Apparent of Turkey, King Albert of\r\nBelgium and Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir to the throne of\r\nAustro-Hungary.\r\n\r\nPrince Sadanaru Fushimi of Japan, Grand Duke Michael of Russia, the Duke\r\nof Aosta, representing Italy, the Duke of Sparta, Crown Prince of\r\nGreece, and the Crown Prince Ferdinand of Roumania.\r\n\r\nPrince Henry of Prussia representing the German Navy, Prince Charles of\r\nSweden, Prince Henry of Holland, the Duke of Saxe-Cobourg-Gotha, the\r\nCrown Prince of Montenegro and Crown Prince Alexander of Servia.\r\n\r\nPrince Mohammed Ali, Said Pasha Zulfikar, Watsen Pasha of Egypt and the\r\nSultan of Zanzibar. Then followed the Princely and Ducal representatives\r\nof a dozen German States, the members of the British Royal family, the\r\nDuc D'Alencon, and Prince Bovaradej of Siam.\r\n\r\nThe mounted group was followed by twelve State carriages. The first was\r\noccupied by the Queen-Mother, Alexandra, and her sister the Russian\r\nDowager Empress Marie, the Princess Royal and the Princess Victoria; the\r\nsecond carriage contained Queen Mary of Great Britain, Queen Maud of\r\nNorway, the Duke of Cornwall, heir to the British Throne, and the\r\nPrincess Mary; the next four carriages carried Royal ladies and\r\nladies-in-waiting; the seventh carriage contained Prince Tsai-Tao of\r\nChina and his suite; the eighth carriage was shared by Special American\r\nAmbassador Theodore Roosevelt, M. Pichon, French Foreign Minister, and\r\nthe representative of Persia; the ninth carriage was occupied by Lord\r\nStrathcona, High Commissioner for Canada, Sir George Reid, High\r\nCommissioner for Australia and William Hall-Jones, High Commissioner for\r\nNew Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe train to Windsor contained a funeral car upholstered in purple and\r\nwhite silk with a catafalque on which the casket was placed and around\r\nit were grouped the near members of the Royal Family and eight\r\nSovereigns of Foreign States. From Windsor station to the Castle the\r\nprocession formed in the previous order except that the Royal mourners\r\nwalked while sailors drew the gun-carriage to the famous home of\r\nBritain's monarchs and to the entrance of the historic St. George's\r\nChapel. Here, where King Edward was christened and married and shared in\r\nso many stately functions, the final religious ceremonies were performed\r\nby the Archbishops of Canterbury and York. While the coffin rested on a\r\npurple catafalque before the altar, which was almost buried in floral\r\nemblems, and minute guns boomed and bells tolled, the briefest service\r\nof the Church of England--at Queen Alexandra's request--was proceeded\r\nwith and the body slowly, reverently, lowered into the vault. A prayer\r\nwas then uttered for the new King and the Benediction pronounced by the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nWhat can be said of the day elsewhere? A full record would fill many\r\nvolumes. In Canada, in Australia, in South Africa, in New Zealand, in\r\nNewfoundland, in all British countries and territories, there was a\r\ngreat similarity of solemn and popular demonstration. Everywhere\r\nfactories and financial institutions and commercial establishments\r\nclosed their doors. Wherever that was impossible in Canadian factories\r\nwork was stopped at a certain stage in the funeral ceremonies and every\r\nman stood in silence, with bared head for the time arranged; on all the\r\ngreat railways of Canada at the moment when the King's body was lowered\r\ninto his grave, and for three minutes, everything stopped, every kind of\r\nwork ceased, every one of at least 40,000 men stood in reverent silence.\r\nMilitary parades took place with muffled drums and passage through long\r\nlanes of silent people, in Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, Chatham, London,\r\nSt. Catharines, Kingston, Woodstock, Ottawa, St. Thomas, Winnipeg and\r\nVictoria, and other places. Memorial services were everywhere held; in\r\nOttawa, Vice-Royalty and the Ministers took part in a great open-air\r\nceremony in front of the Parliament Buildings, with troops and massed\r\nbands and superb drapings, to still further emphasize the solemnity of\r\nthe occasion. Toronto had 100,000 people attend a similar service under\r\nthe auspices of the Government in front of its Parliament Buildings and\r\nso with other centres. It may be added here that besides Lord\r\nStrathcona, Canada had as representatives at the funeral ceremonies Hon.\r\nA. B. Aylesworth, Minister of Justice; Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, Chief\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court; Hon. C. Marcil, Speaker of the House of\r\nCommons; Hon. S. A. Fisher, Minister of Agriculture; Sir D. M. McMillan,\r\nLieut.-Governor of Manitoba; Mayors Geary of Toronto, Sanford Evans of\r\nWinnipeg, and Guerin of Montreal.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the Empire similar scenes occurred. Throughout South\r\nAfrica the most solemn memorial services were held and attended by vast\r\ncongregations. There were scenes of heartfelt sorrow and hundreds of\r\nmagnificent wreaths were deposited on the statue of the King at Cape\r\nTown. Funeral services were held throughout India, the Hindus joining in\r\nthe services in a remarkable manner. All military trains were halted for\r\nfifteen minutes. In Australia the Governor-General and all the Ministers\r\nassembled on the great tier of steps at the Parliament Buildings,\r\nMelbourne, in the presence of perhaps the most solemn assembly ever\r\ngathered together in that country. For a long space there was a reverent\r\nsilence and the crowd then sang the National Anthem. The day was\r\nobserved as a day of mourning in Sydney, bells were tolled from noon to\r\nsunset, and salutes of sixty-eight minute guns fired in the afternoon.\r\nA hundred thousand persons attended the memorial service in Centennial\r\nPark at Wellington, New Zealand. Services were general throughout that\r\nDominion while every outpost of the Empire flew the Union Jack at\r\nhalf-mast and paid a tribute to the dead Sovereign's memory.\r\n\r\nThus there passed away and was buried a great King, a man of\r\nwhole-souled, genial and honourable type, a character rich in graces\r\ngranted to few in this world, a ruler who combined intellect with heart\r\nand knowledge with discrimination, a Briton who could love and believe\r\nin the greatness of his own country and Empire without antagonizing the\r\nlegitimate pride and aspirations of other nations, a diplomatist made by\r\nnature's own hand to soothe international acerbities and embody the\r\nideal of peace in an age of preparation for war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Funeral procession of King Edward VII from Buckingham\r\nPalace to Westminster Hall for the public lying-in-state.

Y.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe New King and His Imperial Responsibilities\r\n\r\n\r\nIn assuming the burden of his great position and manifold duties King\r\nGeorge V had the disadvantage of succeeding a great monarch; he had also\r\nthe advantage of having been trained in statecraft, diplomacy, and the\r\nscience and practice of government, by a master in the art. He was young\r\nin years--only forty-five--strong, so far as was known, in body and\r\nhealth, equipped with a vigorous intelligence and wide experience of\r\nhome and European politics and, what was of special importance at the\r\ntime of his accession, instinct with Imperial sentiment and acquainted,\r\npractically and personally, with the politics and leaders of every\r\ncountry in the British Empire--notably India, Canada, South Africa and\r\nAustralia. He was not known to the public as a man of genial temperament\r\nbut rather as a strong, reserved, quiet thinker and student of men and\r\nconditions. Great patience and considerable tact, common sense and\r\nnatural ability, eloquence in speech and fondness for home life and\r\nout-door sports, he had shown as Prince of Wales or Duke of Cornwall. He\r\nspoke German, French, and, of course, English with ease and accuracy; he\r\nhad seen much service in the Royal Navy and was understood to be\r\ndevotedly attached to the wide spaces of the boundless seas; his Consort\r\nwas beautiful, kindly, and graceful in bearing, with a profound sense of\r\nthe importance of her place and duties and a sincere belief in the\r\nbeneficence and splendid mission of British power.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales became, of course, King at the moment of his\r\nFather's death; on May 7th His Majesty met the Privy Council, signed\r\nthe proclamation relating to his Accession and accepted the oath of\r\nfealty from the Lords and gentlemen assembled. To them he delivered a\r\nbrief address expressive of his personal sorrow and sense of his onerous\r\nresponsibilities: \"In this irreparable loss, which has so suddenly\r\nfallen upon me and the whole Empire, I am comforted by the feeling that\r\nI have the sympathy of my future subjects, who will mourn with me for\r\ntheir beloved Sovereign, whose own happiness was found in sharing and\r\npromoting theirs. I have lost not only a Father's love, but the\r\naffectionate and intimate relations of a dear friend and adviser. No\r\nless confident am I of the universal and loving sympathy which is\r\nassured to my dearest Mother in her overwhelming grief.\r\n\r\n\"Standing here, little more than nine years ago, our beloved King\r\ndeclared that so long as there was breath in his body he would work for\r\nthe good and amelioration of his subjects. I am sure that the opinion of\r\nthe whole nation will be that this declaration has been fully carried\r\nout. To endeavour to follow in his footsteps, and at the same time to\r\nuphold the constitutional government of these realms will be the earnest\r\nobject of my life. I am deeply sensible of the heavy responsibilities\r\nwhich have fallen upon me. I know that I can rely upon the Parliament\r\nand on the people of these Islands and my Dominions beyond the Seas for\r\ntheir help in the discharge of these arduous duties and their prayers\r\nthat God will grant me strength and guidance. I am encouraged by the\r\nknowledge that I have in my dear wife one who will be a constant\r\nhelpmate in every endeavour for our people's good.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech, delivered with obvious feeling and indicating a real\r\nunderstanding and appreciation of his late Father's character and\r\ncareer, made a most favourable impression upon the Council, the Nation,\r\nand the Empire. It was followed by others--all showing tact and a clear\r\ngrasp of the fundamental conditions of the time and of his new\r\nresponsibilities. To the British Army King George issued the following\r\nMessage: \"My beloved Father was always closely associated with the Army\r\nby ties of strong personal attachment, and from the first day he entered\r\nthe service he identified himself with everything conducive to its\r\nwelfare. On my accession to the Throne I take this earliest opportunity\r\nof expressing to all ranks my gratitude for their gallant and devoted\r\nservice to him. Although I have been always interested in the Army,\r\nrecent years have afforded me special opportunities of becoming more\r\nintimately acquainted with our forces both at home and in India, as well\r\nas in other parts of the Empire. I shall watch over your interests and\r\nefficiency with continuous and keen solicitude and shall rely on that\r\nspirit of loyalty which has at all times animated and been the proud\r\ntradition of the British Army.\" To the Royal Navy His Majesty's Message\r\nwas issued with special and personal interest. He was devoted to that\r\narm of the service. From the year 1877 when he entered as a Cadet of\r\ntwelve years old, and 1879 when, with Prince Albert Victor--afterwards\r\nDuke of Clarence--he went around the world in H. M. S. _Bacchante_, and\r\n1885 when he became a Midshipman, he had delighted in the Naval service,\r\nimbibed the free air of the seas of the world and become instinct with\r\npride in England's naval record and achievements. He had been attached\r\nto and served in several great battleships; in 1888 he commanded a\r\ntorpedo boat and in 1890 the gunboat _Thrush_; in succeeding years he\r\nheld more important commands and finally in 1897 had become an Admiral.\r\nTo his Navy King George spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"It is my earnest wish on succeeding to the Throne to make known to\r\n     the Navy how deeply grateful I am for its faithful and\r\n     distinguished services rendered to the late King, my beloved\r\n     Father, who ever showed great solicitude for its welfare and\r\n     efficiency. Educated and trained in that profession which I love so\r\n     dearly my retirement from active duty has in no sense diminished my\r\n     feelings of affection for it. For thirty-three years I had the\r\n     honour of serving in the Navy, and such intimate participation in\r\n     its life and work enables me to know how thoroughly I can depend\r\n     upon that spirit of loyalty and zealous devotion to duty of which\r\n     the glorious history of our Navy is the outcome. That you will ever\r\n     continue to be, as in the past, the foremost defenders of your\r\n     country's honour I know full well, and your fortunes will always be\r\n     followed by me with deep feelings of pride and affectionate\r\n     interest.\"\r\n\r\nParliament met in special Session on May 11th to tender its combined\r\ncondolences and congratulations to the new Sovereign. The Addresses from\r\nboth Houses were identical in terms and referred eulogistically to the\r\ngreat work of the late King in building up and maintaining friendly\r\nForeign relations. To them His Majesty replied briefly as to his\r\npersonal grief and the national sorrow and then added: \"King Edward's\r\ncare for the welfare of his people, his skill and prudent guidance of\r\nthe nation's affairs, his unwavering devotion to public duty during his\r\nillustrious reign, his simple courage under pain, will long be held in\r\nhonour by his subjects both at home and beyond the Seas.\" Meanwhile an\r\ninfinite variety of articles were being written about the new King. In\r\nCanada and the United States the same despatches, practically, came to\r\nthe leading papers; in Canada were reproduced many of the attractive\r\narticles written by special American correspondents in England. Some of\r\nthem could hardly have come from personal knowledge; others contained\r\nmuch of current gossip, passing stories, hasty impressions; all were\r\ninteresting. A remarkable feature of nearly all that was written\r\nregarding His Majesty was the absence of serious criticism or the\r\nslightest cause for condemnation in a life of forty-five years lived in\r\nthe continuous white light which beats upon Royalty with such merciless\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\nThe facts are that King George was and had been essentially a sailor\r\nPrince; that he had in his younger days been open-handed, free, and\r\npossessed of a certain natural and bluff and pleasant geniality which\r\nwas, however, quite different from the urbane, charming, courtly\r\ngeniality of King Edward; that something of this characteristic had\r\ndisappeared from public view after the death of his brother, the Duke of\r\nClarence, and his own assumption of public duties and public work as\r\nheir presumptive--functions greatly enlarged by the accession of his\r\nfather to the Throne; that in his travels through the outer spaces, the\r\nvast Colonial Dominions, of the Empire he was too hedged about with\r\netiquette, too much surrounded by a varied, and constantly changing, and\r\nbewildering environment to exhibit anything except devotion to the\r\nimmediate duty of the moment; that under the circumstances of his\r\nImperial tours, amidst political conditions wherein a wrong word or even\r\nan unwise gesture might, upon occasions, evoke a storm, where not even\r\nhis carefully-selected suite could be expected to understand all the\r\nvaried shades of political strife and the infinite varieties of public\r\nopinion, it would have been more than human for him to show continuous\r\ngeniality--as that word is interpreted in democratic countries; that\r\nupon many occasions and despite these obstacles he did thoroughly\r\nindicate a personal and unaffected enjoyment very different in manner\r\nfrom that of a prince receiving a formal address--notably so in his\r\ndrives around Quebec during the Tercentenary; that the responsibilities\r\nof his position, the personal limitations of his environment, the\r\ndifficulties always surrounding an heir to the throne, had however, and\r\nupon the whole, sobered the one-time \"jolly\" Prince into a serious and\r\nthoughtful personage--a statesman in the making; that he was, what none\r\nof the Royal family had ever been, something of an orator as he proved\r\nby his splendid speech in London upon returning from the Empire tour of\r\n1901 and by his delivery of otherwise routine addresses upon many\r\noccasions; that there could be absolutely no doubt as to his love of\r\nhome, his devotion to wife and family, his personal preference for a\r\nquieter life than that which destiny had given him. King George was\r\nmarried to Princess May of Teck, on July 6, 1893, and the children of\r\nthe Royal pair at the Accession were as follows:\r\n\r\n  H. R. H., Edward Albert      Born June  23, 1894\r\n  H. R. H., Albert Frederick     \"  Dec.  14, 1895\r\n  H. R. H., Victoria Alexandra   \"  April 25, 1897\r\n  H. R. H., Henry William        \"  March 31, 1900\r\n  H. R. H., George Edward        \"  Dec.  20, 1902\r\n  H. R. H., John Charles         \"  July  12, 1905\r\n\r\nOf the new Queen Mary much might be said. Unspoiled by the social\r\nadulation, the personal power of her environment; devoted to her home,\r\nits duties and its responsibilities, and believing her children to be\r\nthe first object and aim of a woman's study and attention, she yet found\r\ntime to master the underlying principles of her future position, to\r\nbecome thoroughly conversant with all the details of sovereignty--not\r\nonly in the ordinary sense but in that new meaning which has come to\r\nstamp the British Monarchy with such an international and Imperial\r\nprestige. The future Queen had some special qualifications for her\r\nposition. She was British by birth and training and habit of\r\nthought--the first Queen-Consort who could claim these conditions in\r\ncenturies of history. A great-granddaughter of George the Third she was\r\nthe popular child of a popular mother--Princess Mary of Teck--and was\r\nborn in Kensington Palace on May 26, 1867, in a room adjacent to that\r\nin which Queen Victoria first saw the light of day. Interested in the\r\ntheatre, in music, and the drama, charitable by nature and incessant in\r\nher work for, and amongst, the poor, a cheerful though not exactly eager\r\nparticipant in social affairs and presiding at the Marlborough House\r\nfunctions with tact and distinction; winning during her tour around the\r\nEmpire the unstinted liking and respect of the people; the mistress and\r\ncareful head of her household, a constant friend and adviser and\r\nassociate of her Royal husband, a loving and devoted mother; the\r\nPrincess of Wales before she entered upon her inheritance of power had\r\nwell proved her right to help in holding the reins of a greater position\r\nand in setting the example of leadership in her natural and important\r\nshare of the duties surrounding the throne of Britain and its far-flung\r\nrealm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING GEORGE V\r\n  Son and successor of Edward VII upon the throne of England]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN MARY, CONSORT OF GEORGE V]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KING AND QUEEN AT TORONTO\r\n  King George V and the Queen when they visited Toronto, Canada, October\r\n  10, 1901, as Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING GEORGE V LEARNING TO SPLICE ROPE\r\n\r\nIn this interesting old photograph King George (on the left), and his\r\nolder brother, the Duke of Clarence (on the right), are shown as boys on\r\nthe \"Britannia,\" where they were thoroughly taught the principles of\r\nseamanship.

It may be assumed that King George V\r\nwill know his people well. He is thoroughly English in life, character,\r\nfeelings; he knows Europe and the Empire better perhaps than any other\r\nliving man; he is in sympathetic touch with rich and poor alike and has\r\ntaken for many years deep interest in philanthropic and other schemes\r\nfor the betterment of the poor; he has been trained in the school of\r\nconstitutional monarchy by the personal teachings of his father and the\r\npotent example of Queen Victoria. The London _Daily Telegraph_ said of\r\nhim at the time of his accession--speaking probably with the knowledge\r\nof Lord Burnham, its proprietor, who had for many years been on intimate\r\nterms of friendship with the Royal Family--that the new King had\r\nundergone sedulous training and been educated to rule by learning to\r\nobey. \"The country will discover in him what those admitted to his\r\nconfidence have always realized--admirable traits of kindliness and\r\nstrength; wise common sense, practical judgment of affairs; shrewd\r\ninsight into character; and a singularly upright and lofty conception\r\nof his kingly duty. He has a frank, generous, unspoiled nature, is\r\nquick in apprehension, deliberate in thought, careful in expression,\r\ncontrolled by a far-reaching consciousness of duty and is animated by a\r\nvivid sense of his exalted mission. He is a keen sportsman, an admirable\r\nfather and husband, and a lovable man.\"\r\n\r\nKing George has also been trained Imperially. He has trod the soil of\r\nhis empire in every part of the globe and visited seas and lands which\r\nno other British sovereign ever saw; he has seen the courage and\r\ncommercial skill and success of his more distant peoples, the pioneering\r\nactivities and growing civilizations of new states and territories\r\nthousands of miles apart; he has obviously learned from them lessons of\r\ngreat import. It required considerable courage in 1902 to make that\r\nspeech of \"Wake up, England,\" to a people who do not readily take advice\r\nfrom their rulers and who notoriously dislike being hurried along the\r\nlines of their development. In other directions there is much to be\r\nhopeful for. His Majesty has chosen his friends well. They are said, in\r\nan intimate sense, to be few in number, but the fact of Lord Rosebery\r\nbeing one of them augurs well of the others. He has a strong sense of\r\nduty, his addresses indicate the principle of Imperialism in its best\r\nsense, his life has commanded the respect of his people. It may well be,\r\nand surely will be in his case, as with the late Queen, with Wellington\r\nand Nelson and King Edward himself, that\r\n\r\n    \"Not once or twice in our fair Island's story\r\n    The path of duty was the road to glory.\"\r\n\r\nTo the political situation at his accession, therefore, King George\r\nbrings a trained intelligence, detailed and intimate knowledge, a keen\r\nperception of the basic interests and feelings of his people. No one\r\nknows, no one can know, what are his political opinions. The\r\nprobabilities are that his principles are not those of any so-called\r\nparty. If they were closely analyzed in the light of environment,\r\neducation, instincts, and natural predelictions the King's policy might,\r\nperhaps, be found to be something like this: (1) The maintenance of\r\nBritish power, including a strong Navy and a United Empire; (2) the\r\nmaintenance of the Monarchy in all its essential rights and privileges\r\nand absolute independence of party. These two lines of ambition would\r\nreally be, and are, one, as in his opinion and, indeed, in that of most\r\nthinking men who are not blinded by passing party phantoms the interests\r\nof Great Britain, of the Empire, and the Monarchy, are identical.\r\n\r\nIn the political crisis of 1910 two questions are uppermost--a\r\nconstitutional change and a fiscal change. In order to defeat the latter\r\nproposals the Liberals in part have created the former situation. The\r\nKing can act only upon the advice of his Ministry unless tacitly and by\r\nunusual agreement, as latterly was the case with King Edward, he acts as\r\na conciliatory force. If the Government asks him to create 300 peers so\r\nas to compel the acceptance of legislation curbing and crippling, if not\r\nabolishing, the Upper House, he can either assent or refuse. Assent\r\nmeans the destruction of a portion of the Constitution--and a portion\r\nvery close to the Throne and which acts as a real buffer against the\r\nhasty action of an impetuous and sometimes imperious Commons. Refusal\r\nmeans that the Ministry must resign or go to the country on an issue in\r\nwhich it is quite possible the people will not support them.\r\n\r\nAgainst the Government, also, in this contest will be urged the full\r\nforce of the growing fiscal feeling, the desire for Tariff Reform, the\r\ndevelopment of an Imperial sentiment which wants some means of giving\r\nthe Colonies a preference in the British market, the pressing need for\r\nsome weapon of retaliation upon highly protective foreign nations.\r\nWhatever course the King takes under all these conditions will bring\r\nthe Crown into the conflict--either as yielding to the Liberals and thus\r\nantagonizing the Conservatives, or by refusing the demands of the\r\nformer, raising up a party--small but vehement--against the Monarchy\r\nitself. There is another element in the situation to be remembered.\r\nEngland, \"the dominant partner,\" is not really behind the Asquith\r\nGovernment. Its majority at the recent elections was infinitesimal; what\r\nthere was came from Wales and Ireland and Scotland; and that of Ireland\r\nwas divided upon the fiscal issue. The whole situation is, therefore,\r\nvery much clouded to the eye.\r\n\r\nSo far as one writer can estimate the end of such a crisis it will\r\nprobably be one of compromise. Almost everything in the British\r\nconstitution is in the nature of a compromise. Constitutional monarchy\r\nin its essence is a half-way house between Autocracy and Republicanism\r\nand its great advantage to the minds of its supporters is that the\r\nsystem has the extremes of neither, the best qualities of each, and all\r\nthe advantages of that strength and permanence which moderation and\r\ntoleration always afford. In Britain the system certainly has the\r\naffection and devotion of the great mass of the people. Mr. Asquith is\r\nnot an extremist, Mr. Haldane and Sir Edward Grey are moderate forces in\r\nthe Cabinet, and though Messrs. Lloyd-George and Winston Churchill are\r\nmore heard of it does not follow, and it certainly is not the fact, that\r\nthey are more influential. They hold the same place in Liberalism that\r\nMr. Chamberlain with his republican tendencies (which they do not\r\nprofess) and his \"three acres and a cow\" held to Mr. Gladstone and the\r\nLiberal leaders of thirty or forty years ago. The Conservatives, also,\r\nare not desirous of pushing the issue too far. They believe in and have\r\ntested the affection of rural England for the aristocracy and the\r\npreference of nearly all England for a second Chamber of some kind. But\r\nthey do not intend to fight the issue on the hereditary principle. The\r\nacceptance, by a very large majority, of Lord Rosebery's motion in the\r\nLords declaring that \"the possession of a peerage should no longer, of\r\nitself, give the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords,\" removes\r\nthis point from the actual conflict and leaves the Conservatives as\r\nurging a strong, reformed and democratised Upper House against the\r\nLiberal policy of a weakened, emasculated echo of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE YOUNG PRINCES AT THE WALL OF MARLBOROUGH HOUSE\r\nWATCHING THE PROCLAMATION OF THEIR FATHER AS KING; AND TEXT OF THE\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas it has pleased Almighty God to call to His Mercy our late\r\nSovereign Lord King Edward the Seventh, of Blessed and Glorious Memory,\r\nby whose Decease the Imperial Crown of the United Kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland is solely and rightfully come to the High and Mighty\r\nPrince George Frederick Ernest Albert:\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of this Realm, being\r\nhere assisted with these of His late Majesty's Privy Council, with\r\nNumbers of other Principal Gentlemen of Quality, with the Lord Mayor,\r\nAldermen, and Citizens of London, do now hereby, with one Voice and\r\nConsent of Tongue and Heart, publish and proclaim, That the High and\r\nMighty Prince George Frederick Ernest Albert, is now by the Death of our\r\nlate Sovereign of Happy Memory, become our only lawful and rightful\r\nLiege Lord George the Fifth by the Grace of God, King of the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the British Dominions\r\nBeyond the Seas, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India:\r\n\r\nTo whom we do acknowledge all Faith and constant Obedience, with all\r\nhearty and humble Affection; beseeching God, by whom Kings and Queens do\r\nreign, to bless the Royal Prince George the Fifth with long and happy\r\nyears to reign over Us.\r\n\r\nGOD SAVE THE KING!]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROCLAIMING THE ACCESSION OF KING GEORGE V TO THE CROWDS\r\nIN LONDON.\r\n\r\nThe third proclamation by the Heralds was made from the Royal Exchange\r\nand was witnessed by an enormous crowd.

George V\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of room for compromise in this, and there is every\r\npossibility that something will be done along the lines of, perhaps,\r\nrestricting the financial veto of the Lords, leaving the other questions\r\nopen, and, meantime, reforming the structure of the House. Whatever the\r\ndevelopments of the future, the new King may be depended upon to\r\npreserve the general principle of a second chamber; to conserve the\r\nlegitimate interests and influence of the aristocracy and landed classes\r\nin the state--when, of course, they do not conflict with the well-being\r\nof the people as a whole; to stand for stability and gradual reform\r\nrather than change for the sake of change; to prefer and enforce\r\nevolution rather than revolution. In all this His Majesty will voice the\r\ndeliberate and well-known opinions--instinct it may almost be said--of\r\nhis people in general. Be it also said, in conclusion, that these\r\nthoughts are generalizations; that the King's opinions are his own and\r\nare not known to the people; that newspaper writers in England, the\r\nUnited States, or Canada, who proclaim an intimate acquaintance with his\r\nviews, and hidden qualities, and private conversations, only betray\r\ntheir absolute ignorance of actual conditions. King George is an honest,\r\nhonourable and patriotic Englishman, guarding the greatest birthright\r\nthat a man can have, watching over the evolution of the greatest of\r\nworld-empires, sitting at the heart of vital and powerful political\r\nmovements. The steps he takes, or does not take, will be carefully\r\nconsidered, and all public knowledge of the new King's character and\r\nlife leads one to believe that they will be wisely taken--in this\r\nrespect following the precedents left by his august father and\r\ngrandmother and realizing the principles and training and looming\r\nresponsibilities of a lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\nThe scan of page 287 is unclear, but it makes sense for the text to be:\r\n\"The King was accompanied by Sir Frank Lascelles, Ambassador at Berlin,\r\nand by his physician, Sir Francis Laking.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Life of King Edward VII, by J.
