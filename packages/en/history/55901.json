Vol. I.\r\n\r\nNew York: Sheldon and Company\r\n\r\n1860\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0001]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0012]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0013]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLISHER’S ADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nThis edition of Lord Macaulay’s Critical, Historical, and Miscellaneous\r\nEssays, contains all the articles published with the author’s correction\r\nand revision (3 vols., London: Longman, Green, & Co.) during his\r\nlifetime, and all the articles published by his friends (2 vols.,\r\nLondon: Longman, Green & Co.) since his death. An Appendix contains\r\nseveral essays attributed to Lord Macaulay, and unquestionably his, not\r\nfound in any other edition of his miscellaneous writings.\r\n\r\nIn this edition the Essays have been arranged in chronological order,\r\nso that their perusal affords, so to speak, a complete biographical\r\nportraiture of the brilliant author’s mind. No other edition possesses\r\nthe same advantage.\r\n\r\nA very full Index has been especially prepared for this\r\nedition,--without which the vast stores of historical learning and\r\npertinent anecdote contained in the Essays can be referred to only by\r\nthe fortunate man who possesses a memory as great as that of Macaulay\r\nhimself. In this respect it is superior to the English editions, and\r\nwholly unlike any other American edition.\r\n\r\nThis edition also contains the pure text of Macaulay’s Essays. The\r\nexact punctuation, orthography, etc. of the English editions have been\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nThe portrait is from a photograph by Claudet, and represents the great\r\nhistorian as he appeared in the latter years of his life.\r\n\r\nThe biographical and critical Introduction is from the well-known pen\r\nof Mr. E. P. Whipple, who is fully entitled to speak with authority in\r\nregard to the most brilliant essayist of the age.\r\n\r\nThe typographical excellence of the publication places it among the best\r\nthat have issued from the “Riverside” Press. We trust the public will\r\nappreciate what has long been needed,--a complete and correct edition,\r\nin handsome library style, of Lord Macaulay’s Essays.\r\n\r\nSheldon And Company.\r\n\r\nNew York, Oct 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF MACAULAY.\r\n\r\nThe materials for the biography of Lord Macaulay are scanty, and the\r\nwriter of the present sketch has been able to glean few facts regarding\r\nhis career which are not generally known. His life was comparatively\r\nbarren in events, and though he rose to conspicuous social, literary,\r\nand political station, he had neither to struggle nor scramble for\r\nadvancement. Almost as soon as his talents were displayed they were\r\nrecognized and rewarded, and he attained fortune and power without using\r\nany means which required the least sacrifice, either of the integrity or\r\nthe pride of his character.\r\n\r\nThomas Babington Macaulay was born at Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, on\r\nthe twenty-fifth of October, 1800. His father, Zachary Macaulay, the son\r\nof a Scotch Presbyterian clergyman, was one of the worthiest and ablest\r\nantislavery philanthropists and politicians of his time, distinguished,\r\neven among such men as Wilberforce, Clarkson, and Stephen, for courage,\r\nsagacity, integrity, and religious principle. His mother was the\r\ndaughter of Thomas Mills, a bookseller in Bristol, and belonged to\r\nthe Society of Friends. Under her loving care he received his early\r\neducation, and was not sent from home until his thirteenth year, when\r\nhe was placed in a private academy. As a boy, he astonished all who knew\r\nhim, by the brightness and eagerness of his mind, and the extent and\r\nvariety of his acquisitions. Two lately published letters, written\r\nby Hannah More to his father, afford a pleasing glimpse of him, as he\r\nappeared to a shrewd and affectionate observer of his early years. She\r\nspeaks of his “great superiority of intellect and quickness of passion,”\r\n at the age of eleven. He ought, she thinks, to have competitors, for “he\r\nis like the prince who refused to play with anything but kings.”\r\n\r\n“I never,” she says, “saw any one bad propensity in him; nothing except\r\nnatural frailty and ambition, inseparable perhaps from such talents and\r\nso lively an imagination; he appears sincere, veracious, tender-hearted,\r\nand affectionate.” He was a fertile versifier, even at that tender age,\r\nbut she “observed with pleasure that though he was quite wild till the\r\nebullitions of his muse were discharged, he thought no more of them\r\nafterwards than the ostrich is said to do of her eggs after she has laid\r\nthem.” In another letter, written about two years afterwards, when the\r\nbright lad was nearly fourteen, she says, “the quantity of reading\r\nTom has poured in, and the quantity of writing he has poured out, is\r\nastonishing.” Poetry continued to be his passion, but his venerable\r\nfriend still testifies to his promising habit of throwing his verses\r\naway as soon as he had read them to her. “We have poetry,” she writes,\r\n“for breakfast, dinner, and supper. He recited all _Palestine_, while we\r\nbreakfasted, to our pious friend, Mr. Whalley, at my desire, and did it\r\nincomparably.” She refers to his loquacity, but that quality seems not,\r\nin her presence, to have been connected with dogmatism, for she calls\r\nhim very docile. At that early age he appears to have been sufficiently\r\nmaster of his stores of information to play with them, and his wit kept\r\npace with his understanding. “Several men of sense and learning,” she\r\nsays, “have been struck with the union of gayety and rationality in\r\nhis conversation.” Accuracy of expression seems also to have been as\r\nstriking a trait of the boy’s mind as volubility of utterance. One fault\r\nis mentioned, which was probably the result of his absorption in study\r\nand composition. Incessantly occupied, mentally, he paid but little\r\nattention to his personal appearance, and in dress was something of a\r\nsloven. Neither his father nor Hannah More could cure him of this fault,\r\nand, up to the time he became a peer, this neglect of externals seems to\r\nhave been a characteristic trait. A fellow-pupil at the academy to which\r\nhe was sent, describes him as “rather largely-built than otherwise,\r\nbut not fond of any of the ordinary physical sports of boys; with a\r\ndisproportionately large head, slouching or stooping shoulders, and a\r\nwhitish or pallid complexion; incessantly reading or writing, and\r\noften reading or repeating poetry in his walks with his companions.” In\r\nOctober, 1818, the precocious youth entered Trinity College, Cambridge,\r\nand during the whole period of his residence at the University his\r\nspecial studies did not divert him from gratifying his thirst for\r\ngeneral knowledge, and taste for general literature. In 1819 he gained\r\nthe chancellor’s medal for a poem on the subject of Pompeii, and in 1821\r\nthe same prize for one on Evening. For these, and for all compositions\r\nof the kind, he afterwards professed to feel the utmost scorn. Two years\r\nafter his second success as a prize poet, we find him comparing prize\r\npoems to prize sheep. “The object,” he says, “of the competitor for the\r\nagricultural premium is to produce an animal fit, not to be eaten, but\r\nto be weighed. The object of the poetical candidate is to produce, not a\r\ngood poem, but a poem of the exact degree of frigidity and bombast which\r\nmay appear to his censors to be correct or sublime. In general prize\r\nsheep are good for nothing but to make tallow candles, and prize poems\r\nare good for nothing but to light them.”\r\n\r\nIn 1821 he was elected Craven University Scholar; and in 1822 he\r\ngraduated, and received his degree of B. A.; though he did not compete\r\nfor honors, owing, it is said, to his dislike for mathematics. Between\r\nthis period and 1824, when he was elected Fellow of his College, he\r\ncontributed to Knight’s Quarterly Magazine the poems and essays,\r\nin which, for the first time, we detect the leading traits of his\r\nintellectual character. He possessed the feeling and the faculty of\r\nthe poet only so far as they are necessary for the interpretative\r\nand representative requirements of the historian. He possessed the\r\nunderstanding of the philosopher only so far as it is necessary to throw\r\ninto relations the vividly conceived facts derived from the records of\r\nthe annalist. He could not create, but he could reproduce; he could not\r\nvitally combine, but he could logically dispose. The fair operation\r\nof these mental qualities was disturbed by the peculiarities of\r\nhis disposition. He had boundless self-confidence, which had been\r\nconsciously or unconsciously pampered by friends who admired the\r\nremarkable brilliancy of his powers. Independence of thought was thus\r\nearly connected with imperiousness of will and petulant disrespect for\r\nother minds. Having no self-distrust, there was nothing to check the\r\npositiveness of his judgments. Where more cautious thinkers doubted he\r\ndogmatized; their probabilities were his certainties; and generally the\r\ntone of his judgments seemed to imply his inward belief in the maxim\r\nof the egotist--“difference from me is the measure of absurdity.” Lord\r\nMelbourne afterwards acutely touched upon this foible, when he lazily\r\nexpressed his wish that he “was as sure of anything as Tom Macaulay was\r\nof everything.”\r\n\r\nA portion of this positiveness is perhaps to be referred as much to the\r\nvividness of his perceptions as to the autocracy of his disposition. All\r\nthat he read he remembered; and his memory, being indissolubly connected\r\nwith his feelings and his imagination, vitalized all that it retained.\r\nFacts and persons of a past age were not to him hidden in the words\r\nwhich pretended to convey them to the mind, but were perceived as actual\r\nevents and living beings. He could recollect because he could realize\r\nand reproduce. To his mental eye the past was present, and he had the\r\ndelight of the poet in viewing as things what the historian had recorded\r\nin words. All men are more positive in regard to what they have seen\r\nthan in regard to what they have heard. If what they have seen awakens\r\nin them joy and enthusiasm, their expression is instinctively dogmatic,\r\nespecially if they come into collision with persons of fainter and\r\ncolder perceptions, whose understandings are sceptical because their\r\nsensibilities are dull. Such, to some degree, at least, was the\r\ndogmatism of Macaulay in his statements of facts. In respect to his\r\npositiveness in opinion, it may be said that his leading opinions were\r\nblended with his moral passions, and an unmistakable love of truth\r\nanimates even his fiercest, haughtiest and most disdainful treatment\r\nof the opinions of opponents. These qualities do not of course wholly\r\nexplain or extenuate the leading defect of his character; for behind\r\nthem, it must be admitted, were the triumphant consciousness of\r\npersonal vigor, the insolent sense of personal superiority, and\r\nthe relentlessness of temper which so often accompanies strength of\r\nintellectual conviction.\r\n\r\nAmong his contributions to Knight’s Quarterly Magazine, the Fragment of\r\na Roman Tale and The Athenian Revels, indicate that at college he had\r\nstudied the ancient classics so thoroughly as to gain no little insight\r\ninto Greek and Roman life. Alcibiades, Cæsar, and Catiline, seem as real\r\nto him as Canning and Wellington. In the papers on Mitford’s History of\r\nGreece and The Athenian Orators, the same tendency of mind is displayed\r\nin a critical direction. His intellect penetrates to the realities\r\nof the society and the individuals he assumes to judge, and the\r\nindependence, originality, and decision of his thinking, correspond to\r\nthe clearness of his perceptions. The Conversation between Cowley\r\nand Milton is an example of the same sympathetic historic imagination\r\nexercised in the discussion of great historical questions, yet angrily\r\ndebated; and in the poem of The Battle of Naseby, which purports to be\r\nwritten by Obadiah Bind-their-Kings-in-Chains-and-their-Nobles-with-\r\nlinks-of-Iron, Serjeant in Ireton’s Regiment, an attempt is made to\r\nreproduce the fiercest and gloomiest religious passions which raged in\r\nthe breasts of the military fanatics among the Puritans. The critical\r\npapers on Dante and Petrarch exhibit the general characteristic of the\r\nwriter’s later literary criticism--intellectual sympathy superior to\r\nrules, but submissive to laws; praising warmly, but at the same time,\r\njudging keenly; and as intolerant of faults as sensitive to merits. The\r\nstyle, both of the historical and critical articles, is substantially\r\nthe style of Macaulay’s more celebrated essays. There is less energy and\r\nfreedom of movement, a larger use of ornament for the sake of ornament,\r\nand a more obvious rhetorical artifice in the declamatory passages, but\r\nin essential elements it is the same.\r\n\r\nIn the choice of a profession, Macaulay fixed upon the law. He was\r\ncalled to the bar in February, 1826, but we hear of no clients; and it\r\nis doubtful if he ever mastered the details of his profession. Sydney\r\nSmith, who knew him at this time, said afterwards--“I always prophesied\r\nhis greatness from the first moment I saw him, then a very young\r\nand unknown man, on the Northern Circuit. There are no limits to his\r\nknowledge, on small subjects as well as great: he is like a book\r\nin breeches.” Indeed, politics and literature had, from the first,\r\nattractions too strong for him to resist; and before he entered on the\r\npractice of his profession, he had, by one article in a review, passed\r\nat a bound to a conspicuous place among the writers of the time.\r\n\r\nIt might have been expected, from his family connections, that he would\r\nbe a zealous whig and abolitionist, and his first contribution to\r\nthe Edinburgh Review was on the subject of West India Slavery. It was\r\npublished in the number for January, 1825, and in extent of information,\r\nforce and acuteness of argument, severity of denunciation and sarcasm,\r\nand fervor and brilliancy of style, it ranks high among the many\r\nvigorous productions in which Macaulay has recorded his love of freedom\r\nand hatred of oppression, and exhibited his power of making tyranny\r\nridiculous as well as odious. It is curious that this paper, so full\r\nof the peculiar traits of his character and style, should not have\r\nbeen generally recognized as his, after his subsequent articles had\r\nfamiliarized the public with his manner of expression. But the date of\r\nhis first contribution to the Review is still commonly considered to be\r\nthe month of August, 1825, when his article on Milton appeared, and\r\nat once attained a wide popularity. Though when, in 1848, the author\r\ncollected his Essays, he declared that this article “hardly contained a\r\nparagraph that his matured judgment approved,” and regretted that he had\r\nto leave it unpruned of the “gaudy and ungraceful ornament” with which\r\nit was overloaded, its popularity has survived its author’s harsh\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nWhatever were its youthful faults of taste, impertinences of statement,\r\nand errors of theory, few articles which had ever before appeared in\r\na British journal contained so much solid matter in so compact and\r\nreadable a form. If it did not touch the depths of the various topics it\r\nso confidently discussed, it certainly contained a sufficient number of\r\nstrong and striking thoughts to rescue its brilliancy from the charge\r\nof superficiality. If the splendor of its rhetoric seemed consciously\r\ndesigned for display, this defect applies in great measure to Macaulay’s\r\nrhetoric in general. He popularizes everything. He converts his\r\nacquirements into accomplishments, and contrives that their show\r\nshall always equal their substance; but in this essay, as in the\r\ndazzling-series of essays which succeeded it, a discerning eye can\r\nhardly fail to perceive beneath the external glitter of the periods, the\r\npresence of two qualities which are sound and wholesome, namely, broad\r\ncommon sense, and earnest enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nFollowing the article on Milton, came, in the Edin burgh Review for\r\nFebruary, 1826, the month in which he was called to the bar, a paper on\r\nthe London University. This was succeeded in March, 1827, by a powerful\r\nand well-reasoned, but exceedingly bitter and sarcastic antislavery\r\narticle on the Social and Industrial Capacities of Negroes. In June of\r\nthe same year, appeared a paper, evidently written by him, entitled\r\n“The Present Administration,” one of the most acrimonious and audacious\r\npolitical articles ever published in the Edinburgh Review. Its tone was\r\nso violent and virulent, and excited so much opposition, that, in the\r\nnext number of the Review, a kind of apology was offered for it under\r\nthe form of explaining its real meaning. Macaulay’s real meaning is\r\nevident; he “meant mischief;” but in the confused sentences of his\r\napologist hardly any meaning is perceptible; and there is something\r\nludicrous in the very supposition that the meaning of the clearest and\r\nmost decisive of writers could be mistaken by the public he addressed,\r\nand especially by the Tories he assailed.\r\n\r\nIn all editions of his Essays, the admirable article on Machiavelli, one\r\nof the ablest, most elaborate, and most thoughtful productions of his\r\nmind, succeeds the article on Milton. It was published in the number of\r\nthe Review for March, 1827. Between 1827 and 1830 appeared the\r\narticles on Dryden, History, Hallam’s Constitutional History, Southey’s\r\nColloquies on Society, and the three articles on the Utilitarian Theory\r\nof Government. These proved the capacity of the author to discuss\r\nboth political and literary questions with a boldness, brilliancy, and\r\neffectiveness, hardly known before in periodical literature. Each essay\r\nincluded an amount of digested and generalized knowledge which might\r\neasily have been expanded into a volume, but which, in its condensed\r\nform and sparkling positiveness of expression, was all the more\r\nefficient. To the Whig party as well as to the Whig Review, such an\r\nally had claims which could not be disregarded; and in 1830, through the\r\ninterest of Lord Lansdowne, he was elected a member of Parliament for\r\nthe borough of Caine. His reputation was so well established that no\r\nidea of patronage entered into this arrangement; and he could afterwards\r\nboast, with honest pride, that he was as independent when he sat in\r\nParliament as the nominee of Lord Lansdowne as when he represented the\r\npopular constituencies of Leeds and Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nAs an orator, he won a reputation second only to his reputation as a man\r\nof letters. From all accounts he owed little to his manner of speaking.\r\n“His head,” we are told, “was set stiff on his shoulders, and his feet\r\nwere planted immovable on the floor. One hand was fixed behind him\r\nacross his back, and in this rigid attitude, with only a slight movement\r\nof his right hand, he poured forth, with inconceivable velocity, his\r\nsentences.” His first speech was on the Jews’ Disabilities Bill, on the\r\nfifth of April, 1830, followed in December by one on Slavery in the West\r\nIndies. Both evinced the broad views of the statesman as well as the\r\ngenerous warmth of the reformer. He threw himself with characteristic\r\nardor into the great struggle for Parliamentary Reform, and his speeches\r\non that measure, not only drew forth unbounded applause from his party\r\nand unwilling admiration from his opponents, but, as read now, after the\r\nexcitement of the occasion has subsided, justify in a great degree the\r\nenthusiastic praise of those who heard them delivered. Clear and logical\r\nin arrangement, abundant in precedents and arguments, fearless in tone,\r\nand animated in movement, they are particularly marked by that fusion of\r\nintelligence and sensibility which makes passion intelligent and reason\r\nimpassioned. The rush of the declamation is kept carefully within the\r\nchannels of the argument; they convince through the very process\r\nby which they kindle. Their style is that of splendid and animated\r\nconversation; though carefully premeditated they have the appearance\r\nof being spontaneous; and indeed were not, as is commonly supposed,\r\noriginally written out and committed to memory, but thought out and\r\ncommitted to memory. Without writing a word, he could prepare an\r\nhour’s speech, in his mind, carefully attending even to the most minute\r\nfelicities of expression, and then deliver it with a rapidity so great\r\nthat no reporter could follow him. The effect on the House of these\r\ndeclaimed disquisitions can perhaps be best estimated by quoting a\r\npassage from one of his political opponents, whose pen, in the heat of\r\nfaction, was unrestrained by any of the proprieties of controversy. In\r\nthe number of the _Noctes Ambrosiano_, for August, 1831, Macaulay is\r\nsneered at as a person whom it is the fashion among a small coterie to\r\ncall “the Burke of the age.” After admitting him to be “the cleverest\r\ndeclaimer on the Whig side of the House,” the account thus proceeds:\r\n“He is an ugly, cross-made, splay-footed, shapeless little dumpling of\r\na fellow, with a featureless face, too--except indeed a good expansive\r\nforehead--sleek, puritanical, sandy hair, large glimmering eyes--and\r\na mouth from ear to ear. He has a lisp and burr, moreover, and speaks\r\nthickly and huskily for several minutes before he gets into the swing\r\nof his discourse; but after that nothing can be more dazzling than his\r\nwhole execution. What he says is substantially, of course, stuff\r\nand nonsense; but it is so well-worded, and so volubly and\r\nforcibly delivered--there is such an endless string of epigram and\r\nantithesis--such a flashing of epithets--such an accumulation of\r\nimages--and the voice is so trumpetlike, and the action so grotesquely\r\nemphatic, that you might hear a pin drop in the House. Even Manners\r\nSutton himself listens.”\r\n\r\nIn the Reformed Parliament, which met in January, 1833, Macaulay took\r\nhis seat as member for Leeds. He was soon after made Secretary of the\r\nBoard of Control. An economist of his reputation, he did not speak\r\noften, but reserved himself for those occasions when he could speak with\r\neffect. Throughout his parliamentary career he showed no inclination to\r\nmingle in strictly extemporaneous debate, though it seems difficult\r\nto conceive that a man of such intellectual hardihood as well as\r\nintellectual capacity, and who in conversation was one of the most\r\nfluent and well-informed of human beings, lacked the power of thinking\r\non his legs. It is probable that he disliked the drudgery of practical\r\npolitical life, and was incapable of the continuous party passion which\r\nsustains the professional politician. An ardent Whig partisan, his\r\npartisanship was still roused by the principles of his party rather than\r\nby its expedients. Literature and the philosophy of politics had more\r\nfascination for him than the contentions of the House of Commons; and\r\nhe has repeatedly expressed contempt for the sophisms and misstatements\r\nwhich, though they will not bear the test of careful perusal, pass in\r\nthe House for facts and arguments when volubly delivered in excited\r\ndebate. Indeed, from 1830 to 1834, the period when he was most ambitious\r\nfor political distinction and preferment, his contributions to the\r\nEdinburgh Review indicate that while in Parliament he gave as much time\r\nand thought to literature as he did before he became a member. To this\r\nperiod belong his articles on Saddler’s Law of Population, Bunyan,\r\nByron, Hampden, Lord Burleigh, Mirabeau, Horace Walpole, the elder Pitt,\r\nCroker’s Edition of Boswell’s Life of Johnson, the Civil Disabilities\r\nof the Jews, and the War of the Succession in Spain. Only one of his\r\nspeeches can perhaps compare with the best of these articles In range\r\nof thought and knowledge, and richness of diction. This was the speech\r\nwhich he delivered as Secretary of the Board of Control, in July 1833,\r\non the new India Bill of the Whig government. Few persons were in\r\nthe house; but Jeffrey, who was in London, wrote to one of his\r\ncorrespondents in regard to it:--“Mac is a marvellous person. He made\r\nthe very best speech that has been made this session on India. The\r\nSpeaker, who is a severe judge, says he rather thinks it the best speech\r\nhe ever heard.”\r\n\r\nSince the time of Burke, no speech in Parliament on the subject of India\r\nhad equalled this in comprehensiveness of thought and knowledge. It\r\njustified his appointment, made a few months after, of member and legal\r\nadviser of the Supreme Council of India. Shiel, in a mocking defence of\r\nMacaulay from the sneers of some person who questioned his abilities,\r\nthus alluded to this appointment:--“Nonsense, sir! Don’t attempt to run\r\ndown Macaulay. He’s the cleverest man in Christendom. Didn’t he make\r\nfour speeches on the Reform Bill, and get £10,000 a year? Think of that,\r\nand be dumb!” The largeness of the salary, nearly twice that of the\r\nPresident of the United States, was probably Macaulay’s principal\r\ninducement to accept the office. His means were small; the gains of\r\nthe office would in a few years make him independent of the world;\r\nand though he seemed, in accepting it, to abandon the objects of his\r\npolitical ambition, he really chose the right course to advance them.\r\nPecuniary independence would relieve him from all imputations of being\r\na political adventurer; and he had every reason to suppose that he might\r\nreach, in England, high political office all the more surely if it were\r\nunderstood that the emoluments of high political office were not the\r\nprimary objects of his ambition. Apart from such considerations as\r\nthese, there was something in the terms of his appointment eminently\r\ncalculated to induce him to accept it. The special object of his mission\r\nwas to prepare a new code of Indian law; and it is impossible to read\r\nhis articles on the Utilitarian Theory of Government, and Dumont’s\r\nRecollections of Mirabeau, without perceiving that he had studied\r\njurisprudence as a science, and that he considered the province of the\r\njurist as even superior to that of the statesman. He went to India in\r\n1834, with the feeling that he could prepare a code at once practical\r\nand just. For four years he labored to solve this problem, and the\r\ndecision of his countrymen appeared to be that, though his solution\r\nmight be just, it was not practical. In the opinion, especially of those\r\nEast Indians whose interests were affected by its justice, it was a\r\n“Black Code.” When it was published, on his return from India in 1838,\r\nit was mercilessly denounced and ridiculed. Alarmists prophesied that,\r\nif adopted, it would lead to the downfall of the British power in India.\r\nWits calculated, with malicious accuracy, the number of guineas which\r\neach word cost the British people. Between alarmists and wits the whole\r\nproject fell through. There was a general impression that the code would\r\nnot work, and, while its ability was admitted, its practicability was\r\ndenied.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence in India only two of his articles, the review of\r\nMackintosh’s History of the Revolution in England in 1688, and the paper\r\non Bacon, were published in the Edinburgh Review. The sketch of\r\nBacon’s life and philosophy is one of the most elaborate, ingenious\r\nand brilliant products of his mind, but it is full of extravagant\r\noverstatements. It is biography and criticism in a series of dazzling\r\nepigrams; the exaggeration of epigram taints both the account of Bacon’s\r\nlife and the estimate of Bacon’s philosophy; but the charm of the\r\nstyle is so great that, for a long time yet to come, it will probably\r\ninfluence the opinion which even educated men form of Bacon, though to\r\nthoughtful students of the age of Elizabeth and James, and to thoughtful\r\nstudents of the history of scientific and metaphysical speculation, it\r\nmay seem as inaccurate in its disposition of facts as it is superficial\r\nin philosophy.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return from India, in June, 1838, Macaulay was offered\r\nthe office of Judge Advocate, which he declined. In 1839 the whigs\r\nof Edinburgh invited him to offer himself as a candidate for the\r\nrepresentation of that city in Parliament. In a private letter to\r\nAdam Black, he gave the reasons why, if elected, the position would\r\nbe agreeable to him. “I should,” he wrote, “be able to take part in\r\npolitics, as an independent Member of Parliament, with the weight and\r\nauthority which belongs to a man who speaks in the name of a great and\r\nintelligent body of constituents. I should, during half the year, be at\r\nleisure for other pursuits to which I am more inclined, and for which I\r\nam perhaps better fitted; and I should be able to complete an\r\nextensive literary work which I have long meditated.” He expressed\r\nan unwillingness to accept office under the government he intended to\r\nsupport, on the ground that he disliked the restraints of official life.\r\n“I love,” he says, “freedom, leisure, and letters. Salary is no object\r\nto me, for my income, though small, is sufficient for a man who has\r\nno ostentatious tastes.” In regard to the expenses of the election,\r\nhe makes one condition which may surprise those American readers, who\r\nsuppose that none but English politicians who are corrupt, pay money to\r\nget into Parliament. “I cannot,” he says, “spend more than £500 on the\r\nelection. If, therefore, there be any probability that the candidate\r\nwill be required to pay more than this, I hope you will look round\r\nfor another person.” On the 29th of May, 1839, he made a speech to the\r\nelectors, which for clearness and pungency of statement and argument\r\nis a model for all orators who are called upon to address a popular\r\naudience. It was probably this speech which drew forth the unintentional\r\ncompliment from the Edinburgh artisan, that he thought he could have\r\nmade it himself. “Ou! it was a wise-like speech, an’ no that\r\ndefecshunt in airgument; but, eh! man”--with a pause of intense\r\ndisappointment--“I’m thinkin’ I could ha’ said the haill o’ it mysel’!”\r\n\r\nAfter some inefficient radical opposition, Macaulay, on the fourth of\r\nJune, was declared duly elected. In September of the same year he was\r\ninduced to accept the office of Secretary at War, in Lord Melbourne’s\r\nadministration. In 1841, when Sir Robert Peel came into power, he went\r\ninto opposition, and some of his ablest speeches were made during the\r\nfive years the tories were in office. In 1842, his “Lays of Ancient\r\nRome,” were published, and attained a wide popularity. In 1843 he\r\npublished a collection of his Essays, contributed to the Edinburgh\r\nReview, including the masterly biographies of Temple, Clive, Hastings,\r\nFrederic the Great, and Addison, and the papers on Church and\r\nState, Ranke’s History of the Popes, and the Comic Dramatists of the\r\nRestoration, written since his return from India. In July, 1846, on\r\nthe return of the Whigs to power, he was made Paymaster-General of the\r\nForces. Though his speech and vote on the Maynooth College Bill, in\r\n1845, had roused a serious opposition to him among the dissenters of\r\nEdinburgh, he was still reelected to Parliament, though not without a\r\nsevere struggle, on his acceptance of office. In 1847 Parliament was\r\ndissolved. By this time his offences against the theological opinions of\r\nhis constituents had been increased by his support of what they called\r\nthe system of “godless education,” which the government to which he\r\nbelonged had patronized. The publicans and spirit dealers of the city\r\nwere also in ill-humor with the Whig government, on account of the\r\ncontinuance of “undue restrictions in regard to their licenses.” From\r\nthe state of the mob that yelled and hissed round the hustings, there\r\nwould have seemed to be no “undue restriction” on the disposal of\r\nspirituous liquors to carry the election. Adam Black sums up the\r\nopposition to Macaulay as consisting of “the no-popery men, the\r\ngodless-education men, the crotchety coteries, and the dealers in\r\nspirits.” To all these Macaulay was blunt and unconciliating, strong\r\nin the feeling that he had excited their hatred by acts which his\r\nconscience prompted and his reason approved. He would not recant a\r\nsingle expression, much less a single opinion.\r\n\r\n“The bray of Exeter Hall,” a phrase in his Maynooth speech particularly\r\nobnoxious to the dissenters, he would not take back, and it was used\r\nagainst him with great effect. A Mr. Cowan, a man of no note, was\r\nselected as the opposing candidate, as if his enemies had determined to\r\nmortify his pride as well as deprive him of his seat. His speeches from\r\nthe hustings were continually interrupted by a mob who, infuriated\r\nby fanaticism or whiskey, received his statements with insults, and\r\nanswered his arguments by jeers. “If,” exclaimed Macaulay in one of\r\nhis speeches, “your representative be an honest man”--“Ay! but he’s no\r\nthat!” was a cry that came back from the crowd. To interruptions and\r\nto insults, however, he presented a bold front, and met outrage\r\nwith defiance. He would not condescend to humor at the hustings the\r\nprejudices he had offended in Parliament, but reaffirmed his opinions in\r\nthe most pointed and explicit language. One of his arguments was that,\r\nin regal’d to the Maynooth grant, no principle was involved. A sum had\r\nalways been yearly voted to support that Roman Catholic College; the\r\nonly cause of complaint against him was that he had spoken and voted for\r\nan additional sum. He was therefore opposed, not on a principle, but on\r\na quibble. “And,” he exclaimed, “if you want a representative who will\r\nperil the peace of the empire for a mere quibble, that representative I\r\nwill not be.”\r\n\r\nHe was defeated, and after it was known that he was defeated, he was\r\nhissed. In his speech to the crowd, announcing that his political\r\nconnection with Edinburgh was dissolved forever, he alluded to this last\r\ncircumstance as unprecedented in political warfare. To hiss a defeated\r\ncandidate, he reminded them, was below the ordinary magnanimity of the\r\nmost factious mob. In his farewell address to the electors, written\r\nafter he had returned to London, he indicated that, to an honest,\r\nhonorable, and patriotic statesman, there might be solid consolations,\r\neven to personal pride, in the circumstances of his defeat. “I shall\r\nalways be proud,” he writes, “to think that I once enjoyed your favor,\r\nbut permit me to say I shall remember, not less proudly, how I risked\r\nand how I lost it.” The following noble poem, published since his death,\r\ncontains, perhaps, the most authentic record of his feelings on the\r\noccasion:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lines Written In August, 1847._\r\n\r\n\r\n               The day of tumult, strife, defeat, was o’er;\r\n\r\n                   Worn out with toil and noise and scorn and spleen,\r\n\r\n               I slumbered, and in slumber saw once more\r\n\r\n                   A room in an old mansion, long unseen.\r\n\r\n               That room, methought, was curtained from the light;\r\n\r\n                   Yet through the curtains shone the moon’s cold ray\r\n\r\n               Full on a cradle, where, in linen white,\r\n\r\n                   Sleeping life’s first soft sleep, an infant lay.\r\n\r\n               Pale flickered on the hearth the dying flame,\r\n\r\n                   And all was silent in that ancient hall,\r\n\r\n               Save when by fits on the low night-wind came\r\n\r\n                   The murmur of the distant water-fall.\r\n\r\n               And lo! the fairy queens who rule our birth\r\n\r\n                   Drew nigh to speak the new-born baby’s doom:\r\n\r\n               With noiseless step, which left no trace on earth,\r\n\r\n                   From gloom they came, and vanished into gloom.\r\n\r\n               Not deigning on the boy a glance to cast,\r\n\r\n                   Swept careless by the gorgeous Queen of Gain;\r\n\r\n               More scornful still, the Queen of Fashion passed,\r\n\r\n                   With mincing gait and sneer of cold disdain.\r\n\r\n               The Queen of Power tossed high her jewelled head,\r\n\r\n                   And o’er her shoulder threw a wrathful frown:\r\n\r\n               The Queen of Pleasure on the pillow shed\r\n\r\n                   Scarce one stray rose-leaf from her fragrant crown.\r\n\r\n               Still Fay in long procession followed Fay;\r\n\r\n                   And still the little couch remained unblest;\r\n\r\n               But, when those wayward sprites had passed away,\r\n\r\n                   Came One, the last, the mightiest, and the best.\r\n\r\n               Oh, glorious lady, with the eyes of light\r\n\r\n                   And laurels clustering round thy lofty brow,\r\n\r\n               Who by the cradle’s side didst watch that night,\r\n\r\n                   Warbling a sweet strange music, who wast thou?\r\n\r\n               “Yes, darling; let them go;” so ran the strain:\r\n\r\n                   “Yes; let them go, gain, fashion, pleasure, power,\r\n\r\n               And all the busy elves to whose domain\r\n\r\n                   Belongs the nether sphere, the fleeting hour.\r\n\r\n               “Without one envious sigh, one anxious scheme,\r\n\r\n                   The nether sphere, the fleeting hour resign.\r\n\r\n               Mine is the world of thought, the world of dream,\r\n\r\n                   Mine all the past, and all the future mine.\r\n\r\n               “Fortune, that lays in sport the mighty low,\r\n\r\n                   Age, that to penance turns the joys of youth,\r\n\r\n               Shall leave untouched the gifts which I bestow,\r\n\r\n                   The sense of beauty and the thirst of truth.\r\n\r\n               “Of the fair brotherhood who share my grace,\r\n\r\n                   I, from thy natal day, pronounce thee free;\r\n\r\n               And, if for some I keep a nobler place,\r\n\r\n                   I keep for none a happier than for thee.\r\n\r\n               “There are who, while to vulgar eyes they seem\r\n\r\n                   Of all my bounties largely to partake,\r\n\r\n               Of me as of some rival’s handmaid deem,\r\n\r\n                   And court me but for gain’s, power’s, fashion’s sake.\r\n\r\n               “To such, though deep their lore, though wide their fame,\r\n\r\n                   Shall my great mysteries be all unknown:\r\n\r\n               But thou, through good and evil, praise and blame,\r\n\r\n                   Wilt not thou love me for myself alone?\r\n\r\n               “Yes; thou wilt love me with exceeding love;\r\n\r\n                   And I will tenfold all that love repay,\r\n\r\n               Still smiling, though the tender may reprove,\r\n\r\n                   Still faithful, though the trusted may betray.\r\n\r\n               “For aye mine emblem was, and aye shall be,\r\n\r\n                   The ever-during plant whose bough I wear,\r\n\r\n               Brightest and greenest then, when every tree\r\n\r\n                   That blossoms in the light of Time is bare.\r\n\r\n               “In the dark hour of shame, I deigned to stand\r\n\r\n                   Before the frowning peers at Bacon’s side:\r\n\r\n               On a far shore I smoothed with tender hand,\r\n\r\n                   Through months of pain, the sleepless bed of Hyde:\r\n\r\n               “I brought the wise and brave of ancient days\r\n\r\n                   To cheer the cell where Raleigh pined alone:\r\n\r\n               I lighted Milton’s darkness with the blaze\r\n\r\n                   Of the bright ranks that guard the eternal throne.\r\n\r\n               “And even so, my child, it is my pleasure\r\n\r\n                   That thou not then alone shouldst feel me nigh,\r\n\r\n               When, in domestic bliss and studious leisure,\r\n\r\n                   Thy weeks uncounted come, uncounted fly;\r\n\r\n               “Not then alone, when myriads, closely pressed\r\n\r\n                   Around thy car, the shout of triumph raise;\r\n\r\n               Nor when, in gilded drawing-rooms, thy breast\r\n\r\n                   Swells at the sweeter sound of woman’s praise.\r\n\r\n               No: when on restless night dawns cheerless morrow,\r\n\r\n                   When weary soul and wasting body pine,\r\n\r\n               Thine am I still, in danger, sickness, sorrow’,\r\n\r\n                   In conflict, obloquy, want, exile, thine;\r\n\r\n               “Thine, where on mountain waves the snow-birds scream.\r\n\r\n                   Where more than Thule’s winter barbs the breeze,\r\n\r\n               Where scarce, through lowering clouds, one sickly gleam\r\n\r\n                   Lights the drear May-day of Antarctic seas;\r\n\r\n               “Thine, when around thy litter’s track all day\r\n\r\n                   White sand-hills shall reflect the blinding glare;\r\n\r\n               Thine, when, through forests breathing death, thy way\r\n\r\n                   All night shall wind by many a tiger’s lair;\r\n\r\n               “Thine most, when friends turn pale, when traitors fly,\r\n\r\n                   When, hard beset, thy spirit, justly proud,\r\n\r\n               For truth, peace, freedom, mercy, dares defy\r\n\r\n                   A sullen priesthood and a raving crowd.\r\n\r\n               “Amidst the din of all things fell and vile,\r\n\r\n                   Hate’s yell and envy’s hiss and folly’s bray,\r\n\r\n               Remember me;

The first two volumes of this were\r\npublished in the autumn of 1848, and gave him a literary reputation far\r\nbeyond what he had acquired by his historical essays. The book was as\r\npopular as any of Scott’s or Dickens’s novels, while its solid merits of\r\nresearch and generalization placed it among the great historical works\r\nof the century. Its circulation, large in England, was immense in\r\nthe United States; and in every portion of the world where English\r\nliterature is esteemed, it was widely read, either in the original text\r\nor in carefully prepared translations.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, the city of Edinburgh, desirous of repairing the injustice it\r\nhad done to Macaulay in 1847, elected him its representative without his\r\nappearing as a candidate. He accepted the trust, though his health\r\nhad begun to fail, and he was already visited with the symptoms of the\r\ndisease which eventually caused his death. He wrote to Adam Black, in\r\nAugust, 1852, that “any excitement, or any violent exertion, instantly\r\nbrings on a derangement of the circulation, and an uneasy feeling of\r\nthe heart.” He was unable to perform his parliamentary duties to his\r\nown satisfaction from the first, and repeatedly expressed his desire to\r\nresign. He was withheld from so doing by the assurances he received\r\nfrom Edinburgh that his constituents were satisfied with his partial\r\nattendance on the duties of his post. At length, in January, 1856,\r\nhe became aware of his incapacity to serve any longer without serious\r\nprejudice to his health, and resigned his seat. Meanwhile, two more\r\nvolumes of his History had been completed and published, evincing that\r\nthe energy of his mind was not affected by the ills of his body. He\r\nalso had devoted some time to preparing a volume of his speeches for the\r\npress, and published them in 1854. In 1857, without any solicitation\r\non his part, and entirely to his own surprise, he was elevated to the\r\npeerage. Though it was known that his health was infirm, there was\r\nno apprehension on the part of the public that he would not live to\r\ncomplete a large portion of the immense work he had contemplated. His\r\ndelightful biographies of Atterbury, Bunyan, Goldsmith, Johnson, and\r\nPitt, contributed to the new edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica,\r\nproved that his faculties were in their full vigor and splendor. It\r\nwas therefore with a shock of painful surprise that all readers of the\r\nEnglish race heard of his sudden death, by disease of the heart, on the\r\n28th of December, 1859. It was felt, even by those who most vehemently\r\ndisagreed with him in opinion, that in losing him England lost the\r\nman who, beyond all other men, carried in his brain the facts of\r\nher history. He was buried, with great pomp, in the Poet’s Corner of\r\nWestminster Abbey, “at the foot of Addison’s monument and beside the\r\nremains of Sheridan.”\r\n\r\nThe first and strongest impression we derive from a consideration\r\nof Macaulay’s life and writings is that of the robust and masculine\r\nqualities of his intellect and character. Since his death it has become\r\ngenerally known that he was by no means deficient in those tender and\r\nbenevolent feelings which found little expression in his works.\r\nAmong his intimate friends and relations he passed as one of the most\r\naffectionate of men, and his benevolence to unsuccessful artists and men\r\nof letters, absorbed no inconsiderable portion of his income. But in his\r\nspeeches in parliament, in his essays, and in his history, he makes the\r\nimpression of a stout, strong, and tough polemic, who is thoroughly\r\nwell furnished for combat, and who neither gives nor expects quarter.\r\nNo tenderness to frailty interferes with the merciless severity of his\r\njudgments. His own political and personal integrity was without a stain.\r\n“You might,” said Sydney Smith, in testifying to his incorruptibility\r\nand his patriotism, “lay ribbons, stars, garters, wealth, titles, before\r\nhim in vain. He has an honest, genuine love of his country, and the\r\nworld could not bribe him to neglect her interests.” This integrity\r\nof character gave a certain puritan relentlessness of tone to his\r\nintellectual and moral judgments. He had a warm love for what was\r\nbeautiful and true, but, in his writings, it generally took the negative\r\nform of hatred for what was deformed and false. He abhorred meanness,\r\nbaseness, fraud, falsehood, conniption, and oppression, with his whole\r\nheart and soul, and found a grim delight in holding them up to public\r\nexecration. His talent for this work, and his enjoyment of it, were so\r\ngreat, that he was tempted at times to hunt after criminality for the\r\npleasure of punishing it. He acquired a diseased taste for character\r\nthat was morally tainted, in order that he might exercise on its\r\ncondemnation the rich resources of his scorn and invective. His progress\r\nthrough a tract of history was marked by the erection of the gallows,\r\nthe gibbet, and the stake, and he was almost as insensible to mitigating\r\ncircumstances as Judge Jeffreys himself. He seemed to consider that the\r\nglory of the judge rested on the number of the executions; and he has\r\nhanged, drawn, and quartered many individuals, whose cases are now at\r\nthe bar of public opinion, in the course of being reheard.\r\n\r\nThe last and finest result of personal integrity is intellectual\r\nconscientiousness, and this Macaulay cannot be said to have attained.\r\nHis intellect, bright and broad as it was, was the instrument of his\r\nindividuality. His sympathies and antipathies colored his statements,\r\nand he rarely exhibited anything in “dry light.” In this respect, he is\r\ninferior to Hallam and Mackintosh, who are inferior to him in extent of\r\ninformation, and genius for narrative. The vividness of his perceptions\r\nconfirmed the autocracy of his disposition, and his convictions had to\r\nhim the certainty of facts. It must be admitted that he had some\r\nreason for his dogmatism. He excelled all Englishmen of his time in his\r\nknowledge of English history. There was no drudgery he would not endure\r\nin order to obtain the most trivial fact which illustrated the opinions\r\nor the manners of any particular age. Indeed, the minuteness of his\r\ninformation astonished even antiquaries, and in society was sometimes\r\nthought “to be erected into a colossal engine of colloquial oppression.”\r\n And this information was not a mere assemblage of dead facts. It was\r\nvitalized by his passions and imagination; it was all alive in the\r\nmany-peopled domain of his “vast and joyous memory;” and it was so\r\ncompletely possessed as to be always in readiness to sustain an argument\r\nor illustrate a principle. The songs, ballads, satires, lampoons, plays,\r\nprivate correspondence of a period, were as familiar to him as the\r\ngraver records of its annalists. But in disposing his immense materials\r\nhe followed the law of his own mind rather than the law inherent in the\r\nfacts. Instead of viewing things in their relations to each other, he\r\nviewed things in their relation to himself. His representation of them,\r\ntherefore, partook of the limitations of his character. That character\r\nwas broad, but it would be absurd to say that it was as broad as the\r\nEnglish race. He _Macaulayized_ English history as a distinguished poet\r\nof the century was said to have _Byronized_ human life. Even in some\r\nof his most seemingly triumphant statements it will be found that\r\na different disposition of the facts will result in establishing an\r\nopposite opinion. Take the article on Bacon, the most glaring of all\r\nthe instances in which he has refused to assume the point of view of the\r\nperson he has resolved to condemn; and any intellect, resolute enough to\r\nresist the marvellous fascination of the narrative, can easily redispose\r\nthe facts so as to arrive at an opposite conclusion.\r\n\r\nA prominent cause of Macaulay’s popularity is to be found in the\r\ndefiniteness of his mind. He always aspired to present his matter\r\nin such a form as to exclude the possibility of doubt, either in his\r\nstatement or argument. Of all great English writers he is therefore\r\nthe least suggestive. All that he demands of a reader is simple\r\nreceptiveness. Selection, arrangement, reasoning, pictorial\r\nrepresentation, are all done by himself. This explicitness, too, is\r\npurchased at some sacrifice of truth. His comprehensiveness is apt to\r\nbe of that kind which arrives at broad generalizations by excluding\r\na number of the facts and principles it ought to include. Real\r\ncomprehensiveness of mind is impossible unless the interior life of the\r\nseparate facts included in the sweeping generalization is adequately\r\ncomprehended. Shakspeare, of all English minds, is the most\r\ncomprehensive; and Shakspeare, in virtue of his comprehensiveness, would\r\ndoubt in many instances where Macaulay is most certain. The most perfect\r\nexhibition of Macaulay’s talent is his analysis and representation of\r\nthe character of James II., from a hostile point of view. He catches his\r\nvictim in a series of cunningly contrived traps, and the poor creature,\r\nin Macaulay’s narrative, cannot move a step without falling into the\r\ntrap marked folly or the trap marked wickedness. Shakspeare’s method of\r\ndealing with character was entirely different.\r\n\r\nAs an artist Macaulay is greater in his Essays than in his History\r\nof England. Each of his essays is a unit. The results of analysis\r\nare diffused through the veins of narration, and details are strictly\r\nsubordinated to leading conceptions. In his History details are so\r\nnumerous as to confuse the mind. Events succeed each other in their\r\nchronological rather than their intellectual order; and his readers gain\r\nan intense perception of particular facts without any general view of\r\nthe whole field. The power of the author to interest us is as evident in\r\nhis account of the Bank of England as in his account of the Massacre\r\nof Glencoe. We pass from one topic to another without any sense of the\r\nconnection of topics. Picture succeeds picture as in the anarchy of\r\na panorama. It seems as if we were reading the work of a poet who had\r\nturned annalist. By emphasizing everything, interest in particulars is\r\nobtained at the expense of general effect. It is only by turning to the\r\ntable of contents that we are able to generalize the events of a reign.\r\nThere are scores of pages in the third and fourth volumes which we read\r\nas we read a newspaper, where an account of a murder may be succeeded\r\nimmediately by an account of a masquerade. Prescott, who cannot be named\r\nwith Macaulay in respect to fulness of matter, fertility of thought,\r\noriginality of style, and unwearied energy of mind, is still superior to\r\nhim in the artistic disposition of his materials. In reading Prescott,\r\nwe have but a faint impression of the author and no feeling at all of\r\nthe felicity of the style, but the real business of the historian is\r\nnone the less performed, for we get a large view of facts in their true\r\nrelations, and are enabled to take in the subject he treats of as a\r\nwhole. In Macaulay the narrative of particular facts and incidents is\r\nincomparably bright and stimulating, but the facts and incidents are not\r\nseen from a commanding point.\r\n\r\nIn his essays, especially his biographical and historical essays, this\r\ndefect is not observable. They rank among the finest artistic products\r\nof the century. They partake of the imperfections of his thinking and\r\nthe limitations of his character, but they are still perfect of their\r\nkind. The articles on Machiavelli, Banyan, Clive, Hastings, Frederic the\r\nGreat, Barere, Chatham, not to mention others, are eminent specimens of\r\nthat critical and interpretative biography, in which the character of\r\nthe biographer appears chiefly to give unity to the representation of\r\nfacts and the application of principles. The amount of knowledge each of\r\nthem includes can only be estimated by those who have patiently read the\r\nmany volumes they so brilliantly condense. In style they show a mastery\r\nof English which has been attained by no other English author who did\r\nnot possess a creative imagination. The art of the writer is shown as\r\nmuch in his deliberate choice of common and colloquial phrases as\r\nin those splendid passages in which he almost seems to exhaust the\r\nresources of the English tongue. As a narrator, in his own province,\r\nit would be difficult to name his equal among English writers; to\r\nhis narrative, all his talents and accomplishments combined to lend\r\nfascination; and in it he exhibited the understanding of Hallam, and the\r\nknowledge of Mackintosh, joined to the picturesqueness of Southey, and\r\nthe wit of Pope.\r\n\r\nE. P. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESSAYS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENTS OF A ROMAN TALE\r\n\r\n\r\n{1}(Knight’s Quarterly Magazine, June 1823.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was an hour after noon. Ligarius was returning from the Campus\r\nMartins. He strolled through one of the streets which led to the forum,\r\nsettling his gown, and calculating the odds on the gladiators who were\r\nto fence at the approaching Saturnalia. While thus occupied, he overtook\r\nFlaminius, who, with a heavy-step and a melancholy face, was sauntering\r\nin the same direction. The light-hearted young man plucked him by the\r\nsleeve.\r\n\r\n“Good day, Flaminius. Are you to be of Catiline’s party this evening?”\r\n\r\n“Not I.”\r\n\r\n“Why so? Your little Tarentine girl will break her heart.”\r\n\r\n“No matter. Catiline has the best cooks and the finest wine in Rome.\r\nThere are charming women at his parties. But the twelve-line board and\r\nthe dice-box pay for all. The Gods confound me if I did not lose two\r\nmillions of sesterces last night. My villa at Tibur, and all the statues\r\nthat my father the prætor {2}brought from Ephesus, must go to the\r\nauctioneer. That is a high price, you will acknowledge, even for\r\nPhonicopters, Chian, and Callinice.”\r\n\r\n“High indeed, by Pollux.”\r\n\r\n“And that is not the worst. I saw several of the leading senators this\r\nmorning. Strange things are whispered in the higher political circles.”\r\n\r\n“The Gods confound the political circles. I have hated the name of\r\npolitician ever since Sylla’s proscription, when I was within a moment\r\nof having my throat cut by a politician, who took me for another\r\npolitician. While there is a cask of Falernian in Campania, or a girl in\r\nthe Suburra, I shall be too well employed to think on the subject.”\r\n\r\n“You will do well,” said Flaminius gravely, “to bestow some little\r\nconsideration upon it at present. Otherwise, I fear, you will soon renew\r\nyour acquaintance with politicians, in a manner quite as unpleasant as\r\nthat to which you allude.”\r\n\r\n“Averting Gods! what do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you. There are rumors of conspiracy. The order of things\r\nestablished by Lucius Sylla has excited the disgust of the people, and\r\nof a large party of the nobles. Some violent convulsion is expected.”\r\n\r\n“What is that to me? I suppose that they will hardly proscribe the\r\nvintners and gladiators, or pass a law compelling every citizen to take\r\na wife.”\r\n\r\n“You do not understand. Catiline is supposed to be the author of the\r\nrevolutionary schemes. You must have heard bold opinions at his table\r\nrepeatedly.”\r\n\r\n“I never listen to any opinions upon such subjects, bold or timid.”\r\n\r\n“Look to it. Your name has been mentioned.” {3}\"Mine! good Gods! I call\r\nheaven to witness that I never so much as mentioned Senate, Consul, or\r\nComitia, in Catiline’s house.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody suspects you of any participation in the inmost counsels of the\r\nparty. But our great men surmise that you are among those whom he has\r\nbribed so high with beauty, or entangled so deeply in distress, that\r\nthey are no longer their own masters. I shall never set foot within\r\nhis threshold again. I have been solemnly warned by men who understand\r\npublic affairs; and I advise you to be cautious.”\r\n\r\nThe friends had now turned into the forum, which was thronged with\r\nthe gay and elegant youth of Rome. “I can tell you more,” continued\r\nFlaminius; “somebody was remarking to the Consul yesterday how loosely a\r\ncertain acquaintance of ours tied his girdle. ‘Let him look to himself,’\r\nsaid Cicero, ‘or the state may find a tighter girdle for his neck.’”\r\n\r\n“Good Gods! who is it? You cannot surely mean--”\r\n\r\n“There he is.”\r\n\r\nFlaminius pointed to a man who was pacing up and down the forum at a\r\nlittle distance from them. He was in the prime of manhood. His\r\npersonal advantages were extremely striking, and were displayed with an\r\nextravagant but not ungraceful foppery. His gown waved in loose folds;\r\nhis long dark curls were dressed with exquisite art, and shone and\r\nsteamed with odours; his step and gesture exhibited an elegant\r\nand commanding figure in every posture of polite languor. But his\r\ncountenance formed a singular contrast to the general appearance of his\r\nperson. The high and imperial brow, the keen aquiline features, {4}the\r\ncompressed mouth, the penetrating eye, indicated the highest degree of\r\nability and decision. He seemed absorbed in intense meditation. With\r\neyes fixed on the ground, and lips working in thought, he sauntered\r\nround the area, apparently unconscious how many of the young gallants\r\nof Rome were envying the taste of his dress, and the ease of his\r\nfashionable stagger.\r\n\r\n“Good Heaven!” said Ligarius, “Caius Caesar is as unlikely to be in a\r\nplot as I am.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all.”\r\n\r\n“He does nothing but game, feast, intrigue, read Greek, and write\r\nverses.”\r\n\r\n“You know nothing of Caesar. Though he rarely addresses the Senate,\r\nhe is considered as the finest speaker there, after the Consul. His\r\ninfluence with the multitude is immense. He will serve his rivals in\r\npublic life as he served me last night at Catiline’s. We were playing at\r\nthe twelve lines.(1)--Immense stakes. He laughed all the time, chatted\r\nwith Valeria over his shoulder, kissed her hand between every two moves,\r\nand scarcely looked at the board. I thought that I had him. All at once\r\nI found my counters driven into the corner. Not a piece to move,\r\nby Hercules. It cost me two millions of Sesterces. All the Gods and\r\nGoddesses confound him for it!”\r\n\r\n“As to Valeria,” said Ligarius, “I forgot to ask whether you have heard\r\nthe news.”\r\n\r\n“Not a word. What?”\r\n\r\n     (1) Duodecim scripta, a game of mixed chance and skill,\r\n     which seems to have been very fashionable in the higher\r\n     circles of Rome. The famous lawyer Mucius was renowned for\r\n     his skill in it.--( Cic. Oral. i. 50.)\r\n\r\n“I was told at the baths to-day that Cæsar escorted {5}the lady home.\r\nUnfortunately old Quintus Lutatius had come hack from his villa in\r\nCampania, in a whim of jealousy. He was not expected for three days.\r\nThere was a fine tumidt. The old fool called for his sword and his\r\nslaves, cursed his wife, and swore that he would cut Cæsar’s throat.”\r\n\r\n“And Cæsar?”\r\n\r\n“He laughed, quoted Anacreon, trussed his gown round his left arm,\r\nclosed with Quintus, flung him down, twisted his sword out of his hand,\r\nburst through the attendants, ran a freed-man through the shoulder, and\r\nwas in the street in an instant.”\r\n\r\n“Well done! Here he comes. Good day, Caius.” Cæsar lifted his head at\r\nthe salutation. His air of deep abstraction vanished; and he extended a\r\nhand to each of the friends.\r\n\r\n“How are you after your last night’s exploit?”\r\n\r\n“As well as possible,” said Cæsar laughing.\r\n\r\n“In truth we should rather ask how Quintus Lutatius is.”\r\n\r\n“He, I understand, is as well as can be expected of a man with a\r\nfaithless spouse and a broken head. His freed-man is most seriously\r\nhurt. Poor fellow! he shall have half of whatever I win to-night.\r\nFlaminius, you shall have your revenge at Catiline’s.”\r\n\r\n“You are very kind. I do not intend to be at Catiline’s till I wish to\r\npart with my town-house. My villa is gone already.”\r\n\r\n“Not at Catiline’s, base spirit! You are not of his mind, my gallant\r\nLigarius. Dice, Chian, and the loveliest Greek singing-girl that was\r\never seen. Think of that, Ligarius. By Venus, she almost made me adore\r\nher, by telling me that I talked Greek with the most Attic accent that\r\nshe had heard in Italy.” {6}\"I doubt she will not say the same of me,”\r\n replied Ligarius. “I am just as able to decipher an obelisk as to read a\r\nline of Homer.”\r\n\r\n“You barbarous Scythian, who had the care of your education?”\r\n\r\n“An old fool,--a Greek pedant,--a Stoic. He told me that pain was no\r\nevil, and flogged me as if he thought so. At last one day, in the middle\r\nof a lecture, I set fire to his enormous filthy beard, singed his face,\r\nand sent him roaring out of the house. There ended my studies. From that\r\ntime to this I have had as little to do with Greece as the wine that\r\nyour poor old friend Lutatius calls his delicious Samian.”\r\n\r\n“Well done, Ligarius. I hate a Stoic. I wish Marcus Cato had a beard\r\nthat you might singe it for him. The fool talked his two hours in the\r\nSenate, yesterday, without changing a muscle of his face. He looked as\r\nsavage and as motionless as the mask in which Roscius acted Alecto. I\r\ndetest everything connected with him.”\r\n\r\n“Except his sister, Servilia.”\r\n\r\n“True. She is a lovely woman.”\r\n\r\n“They say that you have told her so, Caius.”\r\n\r\n“So I have.”\r\n\r\n“And that she was not angry.”\r\n\r\n“What woman is?”\r\n\r\n“Aye,--but they say--”\r\n\r\n“No matter what they say. Common fame lies like a Greek rhetorician.\r\nYou might know so much, Ligarius, without reading the philosophers. But\r\ncome, I will introduce you to little dark-eyed Zoe.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you I can speak no Greek.”\r\n\r\n“More shame for you. It is high time that you should begin. You will\r\nnever have such a charming* {7}instructress. Of what was your father\r\nthinking when he sent for an old Stoic with a long beard to teach you?\r\nThere is no language-mistress like a handsome woman. When I was at\r\nAthens, I learnt more Greek from a pretty flower-girl in the Peiræus\r\nthan from all the Portico and the Academy. She was no Stoic, Heaven\r\nknows. But come along to Zoe. I will be your interpreter. Woo her in\r\nhonest Latin, and I will turn it into elegant Greek between the throws\r\nof dice. I can make love and mind my game at once, as Flaminius can tell\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, to be plain, Cæsar, Flaminius has been talking to me about\r\nplots, and suspicions, and politicians. I never plagued myself with such\r\nthings since Sylla’s and Marius’s days; and then I never could see much\r\ndifference between the parties. All that I am sure of is, that those who\r\nmeddle with such affairs are generally stabbed or strangled. And, though\r\nI like Greek wine and handsome women, I do not wish to risk my neck for\r\nthem. Now, tell me as a friend, Caius;--is there no danger?”\r\n\r\n“Danger!” repeated Cæsar, with a short, fierce, disdainful laugh: “what\r\ndanger do you apprehend?”\r\n\r\n“That you should best know,” said Flaminius; “you are far more intimate\r\nwith Catiline than I. But I advise you to be cautious. The leading men\r\nentertain strong suspicions.”\r\n\r\nCæsar drew up his figure from its ordinary state of graceful relaxation\r\ninto an attitude of commanding dignity, and replied in a voice of\r\nwhich the deep and impassioned melody formed a strange contrast to\r\nthe humorous and affected tone of his ordinary conversation. “Let them\r\nsuspect. They suspect because they know what they have deserved. What\r\nhave they done {8}for Rome?--What for mankind?--Ask the citizens. Ask\r\nthe provinces. Have they had any other object than to perpetuate their\r\nown exclusive power, and to keep us under the yoke of an oligarchical\r\ntyranny, which unites in itself the worst evils of every other system,\r\nand combines more than Athenian turbulence with more than Persian\r\ndespotism?”\r\n\r\n“Good Gods! Cæsar. It is not safe for you to speak, or for us to listen\r\nto, such things, at such a crisis.”\r\n\r\n“Judge for yourselves what you will hear. I will judge for myself what\r\nI will speak. I was not twenty years old, when I defied Lucius Sylla,\r\nsurrounded by the spears of legionaries and the daggers of assassins.\r\nDo you suppose that I stand in awe of his paltry successors, who have\r\ninherited a power which they never could have acquired; who would\r\nimitate his proscriptions, though they have never equalled his\r\nconquests?”\r\n\r\n“Pompey is almost as little to be trifled with as Sylla. I heard a\r\nconsular senator say that, in consequence of the present alarming state\r\nof affairs, he would probably be recalled from the command assigned to\r\nhim by the Manilian law.”\r\n\r\n“Let him come,--the pupil of Sylla’s butcheries,--the gleaner of\r\nLucullus’s trophies,--the thief-taker of the Senate.”\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake, Caius!--if you knew what the Consul said--”\r\n\r\n“Something about himself, no doubt. Pity that such talents should be\r\ncoupled with such cowardice and coxcombry. He is the finest speaker\r\nliving,--infinitely superior to what Horten sins was, in his best\r\ndays;--a charming companion, except when he tells over for the twentieth\r\ntime all the jokes that he made at {9}Verres’s trial. But he is the\r\ndespicable tool of a despicable party.”\r\n\r\n“Your language, Caius, convinces me that the reports which have been\r\ncirculated are not without foundation. I will venture to prophecy that\r\nwithin a few months the republic will pass through a whole Odyssey of\r\nstrange adventures.”\r\n\r\n“I believe so; an Odyssey of which Pompey will be the Polyphemus, and\r\nCicero the Siren. I would have the state imitate Ulysses: show no\r\nmercy to the former; but contrive, if it can be done, to listen to\r\nthe enchanting voice of the other, without being seduced by it to\r\ndestruction.”\r\n\r\n“But whom can your party produce as rivals to these two famous leaders?”\r\n\r\n“Time will show. I would hope that there may arise a man, whose genius\r\nto conquer, to conciliate, and to govern, may unite in one cause an\r\noppressed and divided people;--may do all that Sylla should have done,\r\nand exhibit the magnificent spectacle of a great nation directed by a\r\ngreat mind.”\r\n\r\n“And where is such a man to be found?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps where you would least expect to find him. Perhaps he may be\r\none whose powers have hitherto been concealed in domestic or literary\r\nretirement. Perhaps he may be one, who, while waiting for some adequate\r\nexcitement, for some worthy opportunity, squanders on trifles a genius\r\nbefore which may yet be humbled the sword of Pompey and the gown of\r\nCicero. Perhaps he may now be disputing with a sophist; perhaps\r\nprattling with a mistress; perhaps-----” and, as he spoke, he turned\r\naway, and resumed his lounge, “strolling in the Forum.” {10}It was\r\nalmost midnight. The party had separated. Catiline and Cethegus were\r\nstill conferring in the supper-room, which was, as usual, the highest\r\napartment of the house. It formed a cupola, from which windows opened on\r\nthe flat roof that surrounded it. To this terrace Zoe had retired. With\r\neyes dimmed with fond and melancholy tears, she leaned over the\r\nbalustrade, to catch the last glimpse of the departing form of Cæsar, as\r\nit grew more and more indistinct in the moonlight. Had he any thought of\r\nher? Any love for her? He, the favourite of the high-born beauties of\r\nRome, the most splendid, the most graceful, the most eloquent of its\r\nnobles? It could not be. His voice had, indeed, been touchingly soft\r\nwhenever he addressed her. There had been a fascinating tenderness even\r\nin the vivacity of his look and conversation. But such were always the\r\nmanners of Cæsar towards women. He had wreathed a sprig of myrtle in her\r\nhair as she was singing. She took it from her dark ringlets, and kissed\r\nit, and wept over it, and thought of the sweet legends of her own dear\r\nGreece,--of youths and girls, who, pining away in hopeless love, had\r\nbeen transformed into flowers by the compassion of the Gods; and she\r\nwished to become a flower, which Cæsar might sometimes touch, though he\r\nshould touch it only to weave a crown for some prouder and happier\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nShe was roused from her musings by the loud step and voice of Cethegus,\r\nwho was pacing furiously up and down the supper-room.\r\n\r\n“May all the gods confound me, if Cæsar be not the deepest traitor, or\r\nthe most miserable idiot, that ever intermeddled with a plot!”\r\n\r\nZoe shuddered. She drew nearer to the window. She stood concealed from\r\nobservation by the curtain {11}of fine network which hung over the\r\naperture, to exclude the annoying insects of the climate.\r\n\r\n“And you, too!” continued Cethegus, turning fiercely on his accomplice;\r\n“you to take his part against me!--you, who proposed the scheme\r\nyourself!”\r\n\r\n“My dear Caius Cethegus, you will not understand me. I proposed the\r\nscheme; and I will join in executing it. But policy is as necessary\r\nto our plans as boldness. I did not wish to startle Cæsar--to lose his\r\nco-operation--perhaps to send him off with an information against us to\r\nCicero and Catulus. He was so indignant at your suggestion, that all my\r\ndissimulation was scarcely sufficient to prevent a total rupture.”\r\n\r\n“Indignant! The gods confound him!--He prated about humanity, and\r\ngenerosity, and moderation. By Hercules, I have not heard such a lecture\r\nsince I was with Xenochares at Rhodes.”\r\n\r\n“Cæsar is made up of inconsistencies. He has boundless ambition,\r\nunquestioned courage, admirable sagacity. Yet I have frequently observed\r\nin him a womanish weakness at the sight of pain. I remember that once\r\none of his slaves was taken ill while carrying his litter. He alighted,\r\nput the fellow in his place, and walked home in a fall of snow. I wonder\r\nthat you could be so ill-advised as to talk to him of massacre,\r\nand pillage, and conflagration. You might have foreseen that such\r\npropositions would disgust a man of his temper.”\r\n\r\n“I do not know. I have not your self-command, Lucius. I hate\r\nsuch conspirators. What is the use of them? We must have\r\nblood--blood,--hacking and tearing work--bloody work!”\r\n\r\n“Do not grind your teeth, my dear Caius; and lay {12}down the\r\ncarving-knife. By Hercules, you have cut up all the stuffing of the\r\ncouch.”\r\n\r\n“No matter; we shall have couches enough soon,--and down to stuff\r\nthem with,--and purple to cover them,--and pretty women to loll\r\non them,--unless this fool, and such as he, spoil our plans. I had\r\nsomething else to say. The essenced fop wishes to seduce Zoe from me.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible! you misconstrue the ordinary gallantries which he is in the\r\nhabit of paying to every handsome face.”\r\n\r\n“Curse on his ordinary gallantries, and his Akerses, and his\r\ncompliments, and his sprigs of myrtle! If Cæsar should dare--by\r\nHercules, I will tear him to pieces in the middle of the Forum.”\r\n\r\n“Trust his destruction to me. We must use his talents and\r\ninfluence--thrust him upon every danger--make him our instrument while\r\nwe are contending--our peace-offering to the Senate if we fail--our\r\nfirst victim if we succeed.”\r\n\r\n“Hark! what noise was that?”\r\n\r\n“Somebody in the terrace!--lend me your dagger.” Catiline rushed to the\r\nwindow. Zoe was standing in the shade. He stepped out. She darted\r\ninto the room--passed like a flash of lightning by the startled\r\nCethegus--flew down the stairs--through the court--through the\r\nvestibule--through the street. Steps, voices, lights, came fast and\r\nconfusedly behind her;--but with the speed of love and terror she gained\r\nupon her pursuers. She fled through the wilderness of unknown and dusky\r\nstreets, till she found herself, breathless and exhausted, in the midst\r\nof a crowd of gallants, who, with chaplets on their heads, and torches\r\nin their hands, were reeling from the portico of a stately mansion.\r\n{13}The foremost of the throng was a youth whose slender figure and\r\nbeautiful countenance seemed hardly consistent with his sex. But the\r\nfeminine delicacy of his features rendered more frightful the mingled\r\nsensuality and ferocity of their expression. The libertine audacity of\r\nhis stare, and the grotesque foppery of his apparel, seemed to indicate\r\nat least a partial insanity. Flinging one arm round Zoe, and tearing\r\naway her veil with the other, he disclosed to the gaze of his thronging\r\ncompanions the regular features and large dark eyes which characterise\r\nAthenian beauty.\r\n\r\n“Clodius has all the luck to-night,” cried Ligarius. “Not so, by\r\nHercules,” said Marcus Colius; “the girl is fairly our common prize: we\r\nwill fling dice for her. The Venus (1) throw, as it ought to do, shall\r\ndecide.”\r\n\r\n“Let me go--let me go, for Heaven’s sake,” cried Zoe, struggling with\r\nClodius.\r\n\r\n“What a charming Greek accent she has. Come into the house, my little\r\nAthenian nightingale.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! what will become of me? If you have mothers--if you have\r\nsisters----”\r\n\r\n“Clodius has a sister,” muttered Ligarius, “or he is much belied.”\r\n\r\n“By Heaven, she is weeping,” said Clodius.\r\n\r\n“If she were not evidently a Greek,” said Colius, “I should take her for\r\na vestal virgin.”\r\n\r\n“And if she were a vestal virgin,” cried Clodius fiercely, “it should\r\nnot deter me. This way;--no struggling--no screaming.”\r\n\r\n“Struggling! screaming!” exclaimed a gay and commanding voice; “You are\r\nmaking very ungentle love, Clodius.”\r\n\r\n     (1) Venus was the Roman term for the highest throw on the\r\n     dice. {14}The whole party started. Cæsar had mingled with\r\n     them unperceived.\r\n\r\nThe sound of his voice thrilled through the very heart of Zoe. With\r\na convulsive effort she burst from the grasp of her insolent admirer,\r\nflung herself at the feet of Cæsar, and clasped his knees. The moon\r\nshone full on her agitated and imploring face: her lips moved; but she\r\nuttered no sound. He gazed at her for an instant--raised her--clasped\r\nher to his bosom. “Fear nothing, my sweet Zoe.” Then, with folded\r\narms, and a smile of placid defiance, he placed himself between her and\r\nClodius.\r\n\r\nClodius staggered forward, flushed with wine and rage, and uttering\r\nalternately a curse and a hiccup.\r\n\r\n“By Pollux, this passes a jest. Cæsar, how dare you insult me thus?”\r\n\r\n“A jest! I am as serious as a Jew on the Sabbath. Insult you; For such a\r\npair of eyes I would insult the whole consular bench, or I should be as\r\ninsensible as King Psammis’s mummy.”\r\n\r\n“Good Gods, Cæsar!” said Marcus Colius, interposing; “you cannot think\r\nit worth while to get into a brawl for a little Greek girl!”\r\n\r\n“Why not? The Greek girls have used me as well as those of Rome.\r\nBesides, the whole reputation of my gallantry is at stake. Give up such\r\na lovely woman to that drunken boy! My character would be gone for ever.\r\nNo more perfumed tablets, full of vows and raptures? No more toying\r\nwith fingers at the Circus. No more evening walks along the\r\nTiber. No more hiding in chests, or jumping from windows. I, the\r\nfavoured suitor of half the white stoles in Rome, could never again\r\naspire above a freed-woman. You a man of gallantry, and think of such\r\n{14}a thin, lovely woman to that drunken boy! My character would be gone\r\nfor ever. No more perfumed tablets, full of vows and raptures? No more\r\ntoying with fingers at the Circus. No more evening walks along the\r\nTiber. No more hiding in chests, or jumping from windows. I, the\r\nfavoured suitor of half the white stoles in Rome, could never again\r\naspire above a freed-woman. You a man of gallantry, and think of such\r\n{15}a thing! For shame, my dear Colius! Do not let Clodia hear of it.”\r\n\r\nWhile Cæsar spoke he had been engaged in keeping Clodius at arm’s\r\nlength. The rage of the frantic libertine increased as the struggle\r\ncontinued. “Stand back, as you value your life,” he cried; “I will\r\npass.”\r\n\r\n“Not this way, sweet Clodius. I have too much regard for you to suffer\r\nyou to make love at such disadvantage. You smell too much of Falernian\r\nat present. Would you stifle your mistress? By Hercules, you are fit\r\nto kiss nobody now, except old Piso, when he is tumbling home in the\r\nmorning from the vintners.” (1)\r\n\r\nClodius plunged his hand into his bosom, and drew a little dagger, the\r\nfaithful companion of many desperate adventures.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Gods! he will be murdered!” cried Zoe.\r\n\r\nThe whole throng of revellers was in agitation. The street fluctuated\r\nwith torches and lifted hands. It was but for a moment. Cæsar watched\r\nwith a steady eye the descending hand of Clodius, arrested the blow,\r\nseized his antagonist by the throat, and flung him against one of the\r\npillars of the portico with such violence that he rolled, stunned and\r\nsenseless, on the ground.\r\n\r\n“He is killed,” cried several voices.\r\n\r\n“Fair self-defence, by Hercules!” said Marcus Colius. “Bear witness, you\r\nall saw him draw his dagger.”\r\n\r\n“He is not dead--he breathes,” said Ligarius. “Carry him into the house;\r\nhe is dreadfully bruised.”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the party retired with Clodius. Colius turned to Cæsar.\r\n\r\n“By all the Gods, Caius! you have won your (1) Cic. in Pis. {16}lady\r\nfairly. A splendid victory! You deserve a triumph.”\r\n\r\n“What a madman Clodius has become!”\r\n\r\n“Intolerable. But come and sup with me on the Nones. You have no\r\nobjection to meet the Consul?”\r\n\r\n“Cicero? None at all. We need not talk politics. Our old dispute about\r\nPlato and Epicurus will furnish us with plenty of conversation. So\r\nreckon upon me, my dear Marcus, and farewell.”\r\n\r\nCaesar and Zoe turned away. As soon as they were beyond hearing, she\r\nbegan in great agitation:--\r\n\r\n“Cæsar, you are in danger. I know all. I overheard Catiline and\r\nCethegus. You are engaged in a project which must lead to certain\r\ndestruction.”\r\n\r\n“My beautiful Zoe, I live only for glory and pleasure. For these I have\r\nnever hesitated to hazard an existence which they alone render valuable\r\nto me. In the present case, I can assure you that our scheme presents\r\nthe fairest hopes of success.”\r\n\r\n“So much the worse. You do not know--you do not understand me. I\r\nspeak not of open peril, but of secret treachery. Catiline hates\r\nyou;--Cethegus hates you;--your destruction is resolved. If you survive\r\nthe contest, you perish in the first hour of victory. They detest you\r\nfor your moderation;--they are eager for blood and plunder. I have\r\nrisked my life to bring you this warning; but that is of little moment.\r\nFarewell!--Be happy----”\r\n\r\nCæsar stopped her. “Do you fly from my thanks, dear Zoe?”\r\n\r\n“I wish not for your thanks, but for your safety;--I desire not to\r\ndefraud Valeria or Servilia of one caress, extorted from gratitude or\r\npity. Be my feelings what they may, I have learnt in a fearful school\r\n{17}to endure and to suppress them. I have been taught to abase a proud\r\nspirit to the claps and hisses of the vulgar:--to smile on suitors\r\nwho united the insults of a despicable pride to the endearments of a\r\nloathsome fondness;--to affect sprightliness with an aching head, and\r\neyes from which tears were ready to gush;--to feign love with curses\r\non my lips, and madness in my brain. Who feels for me any esteem,--any\r\ntenderness? Who will shed a tear over the nameless grave which will soon\r\nshelter from cruelty and scorn the broken heart of the poor Athenian\r\ngirl? But you, who alone have addressed her in her degradation with a\r\nvoice of kindness and respect, farewell. Sometimes think of me,--not\r\nwith sorrow;--no; I could bear your ingratitude, but not your distress.\r\nYet, if it will not pain you too much, in distant days, when your lofty\r\nhopes and destinies are accomplished,--on the evening of some mighty\r\nvictory,--in the chariot of some magnificent triumph,--think on one who\r\nloved you with that exceeding love which only the miserable can feel.\r\nThink that, wherever her exhausted frame may have sunk beneath the\r\nsensibilities of a tortured spirit,--in whatever hovel or whatever vault\r\nshe may have closed her eyes,--whatever strange scenes of horror and\r\npollution may have surrounded her dying bed, your shape was the last\r\nthat swam before her sight--your voice the last sound that was ringing\r\nin her ears. Yet turn your face to me, Cæsar. Let me carry away one last\r\nlook of those features, and then----” He turned round. He looked at her.\r\nHe hid his face on her bosom, and burst into tears. With sobs long and\r\nloud, and convulsive as those of a terrified child, he poured forth on\r\nher bosom the tribute of impetuous and uncontrollable emotion. He raised\r\nhis head; but {18}he in vain struggled to restore composure to the brow\r\nwhich had confronted the frown of Sylla, and the lips which had rivalled\r\nthe eloquence of Cicero. He several times attempted to speak, but in\r\nvain; and his voice still faltered with tenderness, when, after a pause\r\nof several minutes, he thus addressed her:\r\n\r\n“My own dear Zoe, your love has been bestowed on one who, if he\r\ncannot merit, can at least appreciate and adore you. Beings of similar\r\nloveliness, and similar devotedness of affection, mingled, in all my\r\nboyish dreams of greatness, with visions of curule chairs and ivory\r\ncars, marshalled legions and laurelled fasces. Such I have endeavored\r\nto find in the world; and, in their stead, I have met with selfishness,\r\nwith vanity, with frivolity, with falsehood. The life which you have\r\npreserved is a boon less valuable than the affection----”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Cæsar,” interrupted the blushing Zoe, “think only on your own\r\nsecurity at present. If you feel as you speak,--but you are only mocking\r\nme,--or perhaps your compassion------”\r\n\r\n“By Heaven!:--by every oath that is binding----”\r\n\r\n“Alas! alas! Cæsar, were not all the same oaths sworn yesterday to\r\nValeria? But I will trust you, at least so far as to partake your\r\npresent dangers. Flight may be necessary:--form your plans. Be they what\r\nthey may, there is one who, in exile, in poverty, in peril, asks only to\r\nwander, to beg, to die with you.”\r\n\r\n“My Zoe, I do not anticipate any such necessity. To renounce the\r\nconspiracy without renouncing the principles on which it was originally\r\nundertaken,--to elude the vengeance of the Senate without losing\r\nthe confidence of the people,--is, indeed, an arduous, but not an\r\nimpossible, task. I owe it to myself and to my {19}country to make the\r\nattempt. There is still ample time for consideration. At present I am\r\ntoo happy in love to think of ambition or danger.”\r\n\r\nThey had reached the door of a stately palace. Cæsar struck it. It was\r\ninstantly opened by a slave. Zoe found herself in a magnificent hall,\r\nsurrounded by pillars of green marble, between which were ranged the\r\nstatues of the long line of Julian nobles.\r\n\r\n“Call Endymion,” said Cæsar.\r\n\r\nThe confidential freed-man made his appearance, not without a slight\r\nsmile, which his patron’s good nature emboldened him to hazard, at\r\nperceiving the beautiful Athenian.\r\n\r\n“Arm my slaves, Endymion; there are reasons for precaution. Let\r\nthem relieve each other on guard during the night. Zoe, my love, my\r\npreserver, why are your cheeks so pale? Let me kiss some bloom into\r\nthem. How you tremble! Endymion, a flask of Samian and some fruit. Bring\r\nthem to my apartments. This way, my sweet Zoe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n{20}(Knight’s Quarterly Magazine, June 1823.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the age of societies. There is scarcely one Englishman in ten\r\nwho has not belonged to some association for distributing books, or for\r\nprosecuting them; for sending invalids to the hospital, or beggars to\r\nthe treadmill; for giving plate to the rich or blankets to the poor. To\r\nbe the most absurd institution among so many institutions is no small\r\ndistinction; it seems, however, to belong indisputably to the Royal\r\nSociety of Literature. At the first establishment of that ridiculous\r\nacademy, every sensible man predicted that, in spite of regal patronage\r\nand episcopal management, it would do nothing, or do harm. And it will\r\nscarcely be denied that those expectations have hitherto been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nI do not attack the founders of the association. Their characters are\r\nrespectable; their motives, I am willing to believe, were laudable.\r\nBut I feel, and it is the duty of every literary man to feel, a strong\r\njealousy of their proceedings. Their society can be innocent only while\r\nit continues to be despicable. Should they ever possess the power to\r\nencourage merit, they must also possess the power to depress it. Which\r\npower will be more frequently exercised, let every one who has studied\r\nliterary history, let every one who has studied human nature, declare.\r\n{21}Envy and faction insinuate themselves into all communities. They\r\noften disturb the peace, and pervert the decisions, of benevolent and\r\nscientific associations. But it is in literary academies that they exert\r\nthe most extensive and pernicious influence. In the first place, the\r\nprinciples of literary criticism, though equally fixed with those on\r\nwhich the chemist and the surgeon proceed, are by no means equally\r\nrecognised. Men are rarely able to assign a reason for their approbation\r\nor dislike on questions of taste; and therefore they willingly submit\r\nto any guide who boldly asserts his claim to superior discernment. It is\r\nmore difficult to ascertain and establish the merits of a poem than\r\nthe powers of a machine or the benefits of a new remedy. Hence it is\r\nin literature, that quackery is most easily puffed, and excellence most\r\neasily decried.\r\n\r\nIn some degree this argument applies to academies of the fine arts; and\r\nit is fully confirmed by all that I have ever heard of that institution\r\nwhich annually disfigures the walls of Somerset-House with an acre of\r\nspoiled canvass. But a literary tribunal is incomparably more dangerous.\r\nOther societies, at least, have no tendency to call forth any opinions\r\non those subjects which most agitate and inflame the minds of men. The\r\nsceptic and the zealot, the revolutionist and the placeman, meet on\r\ncommon ground in a gallery of paintings or a laboratory of science. They\r\ncan praise or censure without reference to the differences which exist\r\nbetween them. In a literary body this can never be the case. Literature\r\nis, and always must be, inseparably blended with politics and theology;\r\nit is the great engine which moves the feelings of a people on the most\r\nmomentous questions. It is, therefore, impossible that any society can\r\nbe formed so impartial as to {22}consider the literary character of an\r\nindividual abstracted from the opinions which his writings inculcate. It\r\nis not to be hoped, perhaps it is not to be wished, that the feelings\r\nof the man should be so completely forgotten in the duties of the\r\nacademician. The consequences are evident. The honours and censures\r\nof this Star-chamber of the Muses will be awarded according to the\r\nprejudices of the particular sect or faction which may at the time\r\npredominate. Whigs would canvass against a Southey, Tories against a\r\nByron. Those who might at first protest against such conduct as unjust\r\nwould soon adopt it on the plea of retaliation; and the general good of\r\nliterature, for which the society was professedly instituted, would be\r\nforgotten in the stronger claims of political and religious partiality.\r\n\r\nYet even this is not the worst. Should the institution ever acquire any\r\ninfluence, it will afford most pernicious facilities to every malignant\r\ncoward who may desire to blast a reputation which he envies. It will\r\nfurnish a secure ambuscade, behind which the Maroons of literature may\r\ntake a certain and deadly aim. The editorial _we_ has often been fatal\r\nto rising genius; though all the world knows that it is only a form of\r\nspeech, very often employed by a single needy blockhead. The academic\r\n_we_ would have a far greater and more ruinous influence. Numbers, while\r\nthey increased the effect, would diminish the shame, of injustice.\r\nThe advantages of an open and those of an anonymous attack would be\r\ncombined; and the authority of avowal would be united to the security of\r\nconcealment. The serpents in Virgil, after they had destroyed Laocoön,\r\nfound an asylum from the vengeance of the enraged people behind\r\nthe shield of the statue of Minerva. And, in the same manner, every\r\n{23}thing that is grovelling and venomous, every thing that can hiss,\r\nand every thing that can sting, would take sanctuary in the recesses of\r\nthis new temple of wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe French academy was, of all such associations, the most widely and\r\nthe most justly celebrated. It was founded by the greatest of ministers;\r\nit was patronised by successive kings; it numbered in its lists most of\r\nthe eminent French writers. Yet what benefit has literature derived from\r\nits labours? What is its history but an uninterrupted record of servile\r\ncompliances--of paltry artifices--of deadly quarrels--of perfidious\r\nfriendships? Whether governed by the Court, by the Sorbonne, or by\r\nthe Philosophers, it was always equally powerful for evil, and equally\r\nimpotent for good. I might speak of the attacks by which it attempted\r\nto depress the rising fame of Corneille; I might speak of the reluctance\r\nwith which it gave its tardy confirmation to the applauses which the\r\nwhole civilised world had bestowed on the genius of Voltaire. I might\r\nprove by overwhelming evidence that, to the latest period of its\r\nexistence, even under the superintendence of the all-accomplished\r\nD’Alembert, it continued to be a scene of the fiercest animosities and\r\nthe basest intrigues. I might cite Piron’s epigrams, and Marmontel’s\r\nmemoirs, and Montesquieu’s letters. But I hasten on to another topic.\r\n\r\nOne of the modes by which our Society proposes to encourage merit is the\r\ndistribution of prizes. The munificence of the king has enabled it\r\nto offer an annual premium of a hundred guineas for the best essay in\r\nprose, and another of fifty guineas for the best poem, which may be\r\ntransmitted to it. This is very laughable. In the first place the judges\r\nmay err. Those imperfections of human intellect to which, as {24}the\r\narticles of the church tell us, even general councils are subject may\r\npossibly be found even in the Royal Society of Literature. The French\r\nacademy, as I have already said, was the most illustrious assembly of\r\nthe kind, and numbered among its associates men much more distinguished\r\nthan ever will assemble at Mr. Hatchard’s to rummage the box of the\r\nEnglish Society. Yet this famous body gave a poetical prize, for which\r\nVoltaire was a candidate, to a fellow who wrote some verses about _the\r\nfrozen and the burning pole_.\r\n\r\nYet, granting that the prizes were always awarded to the best\r\ncomposition, that composition, I say without hesitation, will always be\r\nbad. A prize poem is like a prize sheep. The object of the competitor\r\nfor the agricultural premium is to produce an animal fit, not to be\r\neaten, but to be weighed. Accordingly he pampers his victim into morbid\r\nand unnatural fitness; and, when it is in such a state that it would\r\nbe sent away in disgust from any table, he offers it to the judges. The\r\nobject of the poetical candidate, in like manner, is to produce, not a\r\ngood poem, but a poem of that exact degree of frigidity or bombast which\r\nmay appear to his censors to be correct or sublime. Compositions thus\r\nconstructed will always be worthless. The few excellences which they may\r\ncontain will have an exotic aspect and flavour. In general, prize sheep\r\nare good for nothing but to make tallow candles, and prize poems are\r\ngood for nothing but to light them.\r\n\r\nThe first subject proposed by the Society to the poets of England was\r\nDartmoor. I thought that they intended a covert sarcasm at their own\r\nprojects. Their institution was a literary Dartmoor scheme;--a plan\r\nfor forcing into cultivation the waste lands of intellect,--for raising\r\npoetical produce, by means of bounties. {25}from soil too meagre to have\r\nyielded any returns in the natural course of things. The plan for the\r\ncultivation of Dartmoor has, I hear, been abandoned. I hope that this\r\nmay be an omen of the fate of the Society.\r\n\r\nIn truth, this seems by no means improbable. They have been offering for\r\nseveral years the rewards which the king placed at their disposal, and\r\nhave not, as far as I can learn, been able to find in their box one\r\ncomposition which they have deemed worthy of publication. At least no\r\npublication has taken place. The associates may perhaps be astonished\r\nat this. But I will attempt to explain it, after the manner of ancient\r\ntimes, by means of an apologue.\r\n\r\nAbout four hundred years after the deluge, King Gomer Chephoraod reigned\r\nin Babylon. He united all the characteristics of an excellent sovereign.\r\nHe made good laws, won great battles, and white-washed long streets.\r\nHe was, in consequence, idolised by his people, and panegyrised by many\r\npoets and orators. A book was then a serious undertaking; Neither paper\r\nnor any similar material had been invented. Authors were therefore under\r\nthe necessity of inscribing their compositions on massive bricks. Some\r\nof these Babylonian records are still preserved in European museums; but\r\nthe language in which they are written has never been deciphered. Gomer\r\nChephoraod was so popular that the clay of all the plains round the\r\nEuphrates could scarcely furnish brick-kilns enough for his eulogists.\r\nIt is recorded in particular that Pharonezzar, the Assyrian Pindar,\r\npublished a bridge and four walls in his praise.\r\n\r\nOne day the king was going in state from his palace to the temple of\r\nBelus. During this procession it was lawful for any Babylonian to offer\r\nany petition or suggestion {26}to his sovereign. As the chariot passed\r\nbefore a vintner’s shop, a large company, apparently half-drunk, sallied\r\nforth into the street; and one of them thus addressed the king:\r\n\r\n“Gomer Chephoraod, live for ever! It appears to thy servants that of all\r\nthe productions of the earth good wine is the best, and bad wine is the\r\nworst. Good wine makes the heart cheerful, the eyes bright, the speech\r\nready. Bad wine confuses the head, disorders the stomach, makes us\r\nquarrelsome at night, and sick the next morning. Now therefore let my\r\nlord the king take order that thy servants may drink good wine.”\r\n\r\n“And how is this to be done?” said the good-natured prince.\r\n\r\n“Oh, King,” said his monitor, “this is most easy. Let the king make a\r\ndecree, and seal it with his royal signet: and let it be proclaimed that\r\nthe king will give ten she-asses, and ten slaves, and ten changes of\r\nraiment, every year, unto the man who shall make ten measures of the\r\nbest wine. And whosoever wishes for the she-asses, and the slaves, and\r\nthe raiment, let him send the ten measures of wine to thy servants, and\r\nwe will drink thereof and judge. So shall there be much good wine in\r\nAssyria.”\r\n\r\nThe project pleased Gomer Chephoraod. “Be it so,” said he. The people\r\nshouted. The petitioners prostrated themselves in gratitude. The same\r\nnight heralds were despatched to bear the intelligence to the remotest\r\ndistricts of Assyria.\r\n\r\nAfter a due interval the wines began to come in; and the examiners\r\nassembled to adjudge the prize. The first vessel was unsealed. Its\r\nodour was such that the judges, without tasting it, pronounced unanimous\r\n{27}condemnation. The next was opened: it had a villainous taste of\r\nclay. The third was sour and vapid. They proceeded from one cask of\r\nexecrable liquor to another, till at length, in absolute nausea, they\r\ngave up the investigation.\r\n\r\nThe next morning they all assembled at the gate of the king, with pale\r\nfaces and aching heads. They owned that they could not recommend any\r\ncompetitor as worthy of the rewards. They swore that the wine was little\r\nbetter than poison, and intreated permission to resign the office of\r\ndeciding between such detestable potions.\r\n\r\n“In the name of Belus, how can this have happened?” said the king.\r\n\r\nMerolchazzar, the high-priest, muttered something about the anger of\r\nthe Gods at the toleration shown to a sect of impious heretics who ate\r\npigeons broiled, “whereas,” said he, “our religion commands us to\r\neat them roasted. Now therefore, oh King,” continued this respectable\r\ndivine, “give command to thy men of war, and let them smite the\r\ndisobedient people with the sword, them, and their wives, and their\r\nchildren, and let their houses, and their flocks, and their herds,\r\nbe given to thy servants the priests. Then shall the land yield its\r\nincrease, and the fruits of the earth shall be no more blasted by the\r\nvengeance of heaven.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said the King, “the ground lies under no general curse from\r\nheaven. The season has been singularly good. The wine which thou\r\ndidst thyself drink at the banquet a few nights ago, oh venerable\r\nMerolchazzar, was of this year’s vintage. Dost thou not remember how\r\nthou didst praise it? It was the same night that thou wast inspired by\r\nBelus, and didst reel to and fro, and discourse sacred mysteries. These\r\n{28}things are too hard for me. I comprehend them not. The only wine\r\nwhich is had is that which is sent to my judges. Who can expound this to\r\nus?”\r\n\r\nThe king scratched his head. Upon which all the courtiers scratched\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\nHe then ordered proclamation to be made, that a purple robe and a golden\r\nchain should be given to the man who could solve this difficulty.\r\n\r\nAn old philosopher, who had been observed to smile rather disdainfully\r\nwhen the prize had first been instituted, came forward and spoke thus:--\r\n\r\n“Gomer Chephoraod, live for ever! Marvel not at that which has happened.\r\nIt was no miracle, but a natural event. How could it be otherwise? It is\r\ntrue that much good wine has been made this year. But who would send\r\nit in for thy rewards? Thou know-est Ascobaruch who hath the great\r\nvineyards in the north, and Cohahiroth who sendeth wine every year from\r\nthe south over the Persian gulf. Their wines are so delicious that ten\r\nmeasures thereof are sold for an hundred talents of silver. Thinkest\r\nthou that they will exchange them for thy slaves and thine asses? What\r\nwould thy prize profit any who have vineyards in rich soils?”\r\n\r\n“Who then,” said one of the judges, “are the wretches who sent us this\r\npoison?”\r\n\r\n“Blame them not,” said the sage, “seeing that you have been the authors\r\nof the evil. They are men whose lands are poor, and have never yielded\r\nthem any returns equal to the prizes which the king proposed. Wherefore,\r\nknowing that the lords of the fruitful vineyards would not enter into\r\ncompetition with them, they planted vines, some on rocks, and some in\r\nlight sandy soil, and some in deep clay. Hence {29}their wines are bad.\r\nFor no culture or reward will make barren land bear good vines. Know\r\ntherefore, assuredly, that your prizes have increased the quantity of\r\nbad but not of good wine.”\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence. At length the king spoke. “Give him the purple\r\nrobe and the chain of gold. Throw the wines into the Euphrates; and\r\nproclaim that the Royal Society of Wines is dissolved.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENES FROM “ATHENIAN REVELS.”\r\n\r\n\r\n{30}(Knight’s Quarterly Magazine, January 1824.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA DRAMA.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nScene--_A Street in Athens_.\r\n\r\n_Enter_ Callidemus and Speusippus.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nSo, you young reprobate! You must be a man of wit, forsooth, and a man\r\nof quality! You must spend as if you were as rich as Nicias, and prate\r\nas if you were as wise as Pericles! You must dangle after sophists and\r\npretty women! And I must pay for all! I must sup on thyme and onions,\r\nwhile you are swallowing thrushes and hares! I must drink water, that\r\nyou may play the cottabus (1) with Chian wine! I must wander about as\r\nragged as Pauson,(2) that you may be as fine as Alcibiades! I must lie\r\non bare boards, with a stone (3) for my pillow, and a rotten mat for\r\nmy coverlid, by the light of a wretched winking lamp, while you are\r\nmarching in state, with as many torches as one sees at the feast of\r\nCeres, to thunder with your hatchet(4) at the doors of half the Ionian\r\nladies in Peiræus.(5)\r\n\r\n     (1) This game consisted in projecting wine out of cups; it\r\n     was a diversion extremely fashionable at Athenian\r\n     entertainments.\r\n\r\n     (2) Pauson was an Athenian painter, whose name was\r\n     synonymous with beggary. See Aristophanes; Plutus, 602. From\r\n     his poverty, I am inclined to suppose that he painted\r\n     historical pictures.\r\n\r\n     (3) See Aristophanes; Plutus, 542. {31}\r\n\r\n     (4)See Theocritus; Idyll ii. 128.\r\n\r\n     (5) This was the most disreputable part of Athens. See\r\n     Aristophanes; Pax, 165.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEUSIPPUS.\r\n\r\nWhy, thou unreasonable old man! Thou most shameless of fathers!----\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nUngrateful wretch; dare you talk so? Are you not afraid of the thunders\r\nof Jupiter?\r\n\r\nSPEUSIPPUS.\r\n\r\nJupiter thunder! nonsense! Anaxagoras says, that thunder is only an\r\nexplosion produced by----\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nHe does! Would that it had fallen on his head for his pains!\r\n\r\nSPEUSIPPUS.\r\n\r\nNay: talk rationally.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nRationally! You audacious young sophist! I will talk rationally. Do you\r\nknow that I am your father? What quibble can you make upon that?\r\n\r\nSPEUSIPPUS.\r\n\r\nDo I know that you are my father? Let us take the question to pieces, as\r\nMelesigenes would say. First, then, we must inquire what is knowledge?\r\nSecondly, what is a father? Now, knowledge, as Socrates said the other\r\nday to Theætetus,---(1)\r\n\r\n     (1) See Plato’s Theætetus.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS. {32}Socrates! what! the ragged flat-nosed old dotard, who\r\nwalks about all day barefoot, and filches cloaks, and dissects gnats,\r\nand shoes(1) fleas with wax?\r\n\r\nSPEUSIPPUS.\r\n\r\nAll fiction! All trumped up by Aristophanes!\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nBy Pallas, if he is in the habit of putting shoes on his fleas, he is\r\nkinder to them than to himself. But listen to me, boy; if you go on in\r\nthis way, you will be ruined. There is an argument for you. Go to your\r\nSocrates and your Melesigenes, and tell them to refute that. Ruined! Do\r\nyou hear?\r\n\r\nSPEUSIPPUS.\r\n\r\nRuined!\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nAy, by Jupiter! Is such a show as you make to be supported on\r\nnothing? During all the last war, I made not an obol from my farm; the\r\nPeloponnesian locusts came almost as regularly as the Pleiades;--corn\r\nburnt;--olives stripped;--fruit trees cut down;--wells stopped up;--and,\r\njust when peace came, and I hoped that all would turn out well, you must\r\nbegin to spend as if you had all the mines of Thasus at command.\r\n\r\nSPEUSIPPUS.\r\n\r\nNow, by Neptune, who delights in horses----\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nIf Neptune delights in horses, he does not resemble\r\n\r\n     (1) See Aristophanes; Nubes, 150. {33}me. You must ride at\r\n     the Panathenæa on a horse fit for the great king: four acres\r\n     of my best vines went for that folly. You must retrench, or\r\n     you will have nothing to eat. Does not Anaxagoras mention,\r\n     among his other discoveries, that when a man has nothing to\r\n     eat he dies?\r\n\r\nSPEUSIPPUS.\r\n\r\nYou are deceived. My friends-----------\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nOh, yes! your friends will notice you, doubtless, when you are squeezing\r\nthrough the crowd, on a winter’s day, to warm yourself at the fire of\r\nthe baths;--or when you are fighting with beggars and beggars’ dogs for\r\nthe scraps of a sacrifice;--or when you are glad to earn three wretched\r\nobols(1) by listening all day to lying speeches and crying children.\r\n\r\nSPEUSIPPUS.\r\n\r\nThere are other means of support.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nWhat! I suppose you will wander from house to house, like that wretched\r\nbuffoon Philippus(2), and beg every body who has asked a supper-party to\r\nbe so kind as to feed you and laugh at you; or you will turn sycophant;\r\nyou will get a bunch of grapes, or a pair of shoes, now and then, by\r\nfrightening some rich coward with a mock prosecution. Well! that is a\r\ntask for which your studies under the sophists may have fitted you.\r\n\r\n     (1) The stipend of an Athenian juryman.\r\n\r\n     (2) Xenophon, Convivium\r\n\r\nSPEUSIPPUS.\r\n\r\nYou are wide of the mark.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMOS. {34}\r\n\r\nThen what, in the name of Juno, is your scheme? Do you intend to join\r\nOrestes,(1) and rob on the highway? Take care; beware of the eleven; (2)\r\nbeware of the hemlock. It may be very pleasant to live at other people’s\r\nexpense; but not very pleasant, I should think, to hear the pestle\r\ngive its last hang against the mortar, when the cold dose is ready.\r\nPah!---------\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nHemlock! Orestes! folly!--I aim at nobler objects. What say you to\r\npolitics,--the general assembly?\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nYou an orator!--oh no! no! Cleon was worth twenty such fools as you.\r\nYou have succeeded, I grant, to his impudence, for which, if there\r\nbe justice in Tartarus, he is now soaking up to the eyes in his own\r\ntan-pickle. But the Paphlagonian had parts.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nAnd you mean to imply-----------\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nNot I. You are a Pericles in embryo, doubtless. Well: and when are you\r\nto make your first speech? oh Pallas!\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nI thought of speaking, the other day, on the Sicilian expedition; but\r\nNicias (3) got up before me.\r\n\r\n     (1) A celebrated highwayman of Attica. See Aristophanes;\r\n     Aves, 711: and in several other passages.\r\n\r\n     (2) The police officers of Athens.\r\n\r\n     (3) See Thucydides, vi. 8.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\n{35}Nicias, poor honest man, might just as well have sate still; his\r\nspeaking did but little good. The loss of your oration is, doubtless, an\r\nirreparable public calamity.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nWhy, not so; I intend to introduce it at the next assembly; it will suit\r\nany subject.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, it will suit none. But pray, if it be not too\r\npresumptuous a request, indulge me with a specimen.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nWell; suppose the agora crowded;--an important subject under\r\ndiscussion;--an ambassador from Argos, or from the great king;--the\r\ntributes from the islands;--an impeachment;--in short, anything you\r\nplease. The crier makes proclamation.--“Any citizen above fifty years\r\nold may speak--any citizen not disqualified may speak.” Then I rise:--a\r\ngreat murmur of curiosity while I am mounting the stand.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nOf curiosity! yes, and of something else too. You will infallibly be\r\ndragged down by main force, like poor Glaucon (1) last year.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nNever fear. I shall begin in this style:\r\n\r\n“When I consider, Athenians, the importance of our city;--when I\r\nconsider the extent of its power,\r\n\r\n     (1) See Xenophon; Memorabilia, iii.\r\n\r\n{36}the wisdom of its laws, the elegance of its decorations--when\r\nI consider by what names and by what exploits its annals are\r\nadorned;--when I think on Harmodius and Aristogiton, on Themistocles\r\nand Miltiades, on Cimon and Pericles;--when I contemplate our\r\npre-eminence in arts and letters;--when I observe so many flourishing\r\nstates and islands compelled to own the dominion, and purchase the\r\nprotection, of the City of the Violet Crown(1)--\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nI shall choke with rage. Oh, all ye gods and goddesses, what sacrilege,\r\nwhat perjury have I ever committed, that I should be singled out from\r\namong all the citizens of Athens to be the father of this fool?\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nWhat now? By Bacchus, old man, I would not advise you to give way to\r\nsuch fits of passion in the streets. If Aristophanes were to see you,\r\nyou would infallibly be in a comedy next spring.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nYou have more reason to fear Aristophanes than any fool living. Oh, that\r\nhe could but hear you trying to imitate the slang of Straton(2) and the\r\nlisp of Alcibiades!(3) You would be an inexhaustible subject. You would\r\nconsole him for the loss of Cleon.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS\r\n\r\nNo, no. I may perhaps figure at the dramatic representations before\r\nlong; but in a very different way.\r\n\r\n     (1) A favourite epithet of Athens. See Aristophanes; Acharn.\r\n     637.\r\n\r\n     (2) See Aristophanes; Equités, 1375.\r\n\r\n     (3) See Aristophanes; Vespæ, 44.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\n{37}What do you mean?\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nWhat say you to a tragedy?\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nA tragedy of yours?\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nEven so.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nOh Hercules! Oh Bacchus! This is too much. Here is an universal genius;\r\nsophist,--orator,--poet. To what a three-headed monster have I given\r\nbirth! a perfect Cerberus of intellect! And pray what may your piece\r\nbe about? Or will your tragedy, like your speech, serve equally for any\r\nsubject?\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nI thought of several plots;--Odipus,--Eteocles and Polynices,--the war\r\nof Troy, the murder of Agamemnon.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nAnd what have you chosen?\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nYou know there is a law which permits any modern poet to retouch a play\r\nof Æschylus, and bring it forward as his own composition. And, as there\r\nis an absurd prejudice, among the vulgar, in favour of his extravagant\r\npieces, I have selected one of them, and altered it.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\n{38}Which of them?\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nOh! that mass of barbarous absurdities, the Prometheus. But I have\r\nframed it anew upon the model of Euripides. By Bacchus, I shall make\r\nSophocles and Agathon look about them. You would not know the play\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nBy Jupiter, I believe not.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nI have omitted the whole of the absurd dialogue between Vulcan and\r\nStrength, at the beginning.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nThat may be, on the whole, an improvement. The play will then open with\r\nthat grand soliloquy of Prometheus, when he is chained to the rock.\r\n\r\n                   “Oh! ye eternal heavens! Ye rushing winds!\r\n\r\n                   Ye fountains of great streams! Ye ocean waves,\r\n\r\n                   That in ten thousand sparkling dimples wreathe\r\n\r\n                   Your azure smiles! All-generating earth!\r\n\r\n                   All-seeing sun! On you, on you, I call.” (1)\r\n\r\nWell, I allow that will be striking; I did not think you capable of that\r\nidea. Why do you laugh?\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nDo you seriously suppose that one who has studied the plays of that\r\ngreat man, Euripides, would ever begin a tragedy in such a ranting\r\nstyle?\r\n\r\n     (1) See Æschylus; Prometheus, 88.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\n{39}What, does not your play open with the speech of Prometheus?\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nNo doubt.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nThen what, in the name of Bacchus, do you make him say?\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nYou shall hear; and, if it be not in the very style of Euripides, call\r\nme a fool.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nThat is a liberty which I shall venture to take, whether it be or no.\r\nBut go on.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nPrometheus begins thus:\r\n\r\n                   “Coelus begat Saturn and Briareus,\r\n\r\n                   Cottus and Creius and Iapetus,\r\n\r\n                   Gyges and Hyperion, Phoebe, Tethys,\r\n\r\n                   Thea and Rhea and Mnemosyne.\r\n\r\n                   Then Saturn wedded Rhea, and begat\r\n\r\n                   Pluto and Neptune, Jupiter and Juno.\"\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nVery beautiful, and very natural; and, as you say, very like Euripides.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nYou are sneering. Really, father, you do not understand these things.\r\nYou had not those advantages in your youth--\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nWhich I have been fool enough to let you have. No; in my early days,\r\nlying had not been dignified into a science, nor politics degraded into\r\na trade. {40}wrestled, and read Homer’s battles, instead of dressing my\r\nhair, and reciting lectures in verse out of Euripides. But I have some\r\nnotion of what a play should be; I have seen Phrynichus, and lived with\r\nÆschylus. I saw the representation of the Persians.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nA wretched play; it may amuse the fools who row the triremes; but it is\r\nutterly unworthy to be read by any man of taste.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nIf you had seen it acted;--the whole theatre frantic with joy, stamping,\r\nshouting, laughing, crying. There was Cynaegeirus, the brother of\r\nÆschylus, who lost both his arms at Marathon, beating the stumps against\r\nhis sides with rapture. When the crowd remarked him--But where are you\r\ngoing?\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nTo sup with Alcibiades; he sails with the expedition for Sicily in a few\r\ndays; this is his farewell entertainment.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nSo much the better; I should say, so much the worse. That cursed\r\nSicilian expedition! And you were one of the young fools(1) who stood\r\nclapping and shouting while he was gulling the rabble, and who drowned\r\npoor Nicias’s voice with your uproar. Look to it; a day of reckoning\r\nwill come. As to Alcibiades himself--\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nWhat can you say against him? His enemies themselves acknowledge his\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\n     (1) See Thucydides, vi. 13.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\n{41}They acknowledge that he is clever, and handsome, and that he was\r\ncrowned at the Olympic games. And what other merits do his friends claim\r\nfor him? A. precious assembly you will meet at his house, no doubt.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nThe first men in Athens, probably.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nWhom do you mean by the first men in Athens?\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nCallicles.(1)\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nA sacrilegious, impious, unfeeling ruffian!\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nHippomachus.\r\n\r\nCALLIDEMUS.\r\n\r\nA fool, who can talk of nothing but his travels through Persia and\r\nEgypt. Go, go. The gods fordid that I should detain you from such choice\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt severally.\r\n\r\n     (1) Callicles plays a conspicuous part in the Gorgias of\r\n     Plato.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nScene--_A Hall in the House of_ Alcibiades,\r\n\r\nAlcibiades, Speusippus, Callicles, Hippomachus, Chariclea, _and others,\r\nseated round a table, feasting._\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES. {42}Bring larger cups. This shall be our gayest revel. It is\r\nprobably the last--for some of us at least.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nAt all events, it ‘will be long before you taste such wine again,\r\nAlcibiades.\r\n\r\nCALLICLES.\r\n\r\nNay, there is excellent wine in Sicily. When I was there with\r\nEurymedon’s squadron, I had many a long carouse. You never saw finer\r\ngrapes than those of Ætna.\r\n\r\nHIPPOMACHUS.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks do not understand the art of making wine. Your Persian is the\r\nman. So rich, so fragrant, so sparkling. I will tell you what the Satrap\r\nof Caria said to me about that when I supped with him.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nNay, sweet Hippomachus; not a word to-night about satraps, or the\r\ngreat king, or the walls of Babylon, or the Pyramids, or the mummies.\r\nChariclea, why do you look so sad?\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nCan I be cheerful when you are going to leave me, Alcibiades?\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nMy life, my sweet soul, it is but for a short time. In {43}a year we\r\nconquer Sicily. In another, we humble Carthage. (1) I will bring back\r\nsuch robes, such necklaces, elephants’ teeth by thousands, ay, and the\r\nelephants themselves, if you wish to see them. Nay, smile, my Chariclea,\r\nor I shall talk nonsense to no purpose.\r\n\r\nHIPPOMACHUS.\r\n\r\nThe largest elephant that I ever saw was in the grounds of Teribazus,\r\nnear Susa. I wish that I had measured him.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nI wish that he had trod upon you. Come, come, Chariclea, we shall soon\r\nreturn, and then----\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nYes; then, indeed.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nYes, then--\r\n\r\n                   Then for revels; then for dances,\r\n\r\n                   Tender whispers, melting glances.\r\n\r\n                   Peasants, pluck your richest fruits:\r\n\r\n                   Minstrels, sound your sweetest flutes:\r\n\r\n                   Come in laughing crowds to greet us,\r\n\r\n                   Dark-eyed daughters of Miletus;\r\n\r\n                   Bring the myrtles, bring the dice,\r\n\r\n                   Floods of Chian, hills of spice.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nWhose lines are those, Alcibiades?\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nMy own. Think you, because I do not shut myself up to meditate, and\r\ndrink water, and eat herbs, that I cannot write verses? By Apollo, if I\r\ndid not spend\r\n\r\n     (1) See Thucydides, vi. 90.\r\n\r\n{44}my days in politics, and my nights in revelry, I should have made\r\nSophocles tremble. But now I never go beyond a little song like this,\r\nand never invoke any Muse but Chariclea. But come, Speusippus, sing. You\r\nare a professed poet. Let us have some of your verses.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nMy verses! How can you talk so? I a professed poet.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nOh, content you, sweet Speusippus. We all know your designs upon the\r\ntragic honours. Come, sing. A chorus of your new play.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nNay, nay--\r\n\r\nHIPPOMACHUS.\r\n\r\nWhen a guest who is asked to sing at a Persian banquet refuses----\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nIn the name of Bacchus----\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nI am absolute. Sing.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nWell, then, I will sing you a chorus, which, I think, is a tolerable\r\nimitation of Euripides.\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nOf Euripides?--Not a word!\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nWhy so, sweet Chariclea?\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA. {45}Would you have me betray my sex? Would you have me forget\r\nhis Phædras and Sthenoboas? No: if I ever suffer any lines of that\r\nwoman-hater, or his imitators, to be sung in my presence, may I (1) sell\r\nherbs like his mother, and wear rags like his Telephus. (2)\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nThen, sweet Chariclea, since you have silenced Speusippus, you shall\r\nsing yourself.\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nWhat shall I sing?\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nNay, choose for yourself.\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nThen I will sing an old Ionian hymn, which is chanted every spring at\r\nthe feast of Venus, near Miletus. I used to sing it in my own country\r\nwhen I was a child; and--Ah, Alcibiades!\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nDear Chariclea, you shall sing something else. This distresses you.\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nNo: hand me the lyre:--no matter. You will hear the song to\r\ndisadvantage. But if it were sung as I have heard it sung;--if this were\r\na beautiful morning\r\n\r\n     (1) The mother of Euripides was a herb-woman. This was a\r\n     favourite topic of Aristophanes.\r\n\r\n     (2) The hero of one of the lost plays of Euripides, who\r\n     appears to have been brought upon the stage in the garb of a\r\n     beggar. See Aristophanes; Acham. 430; and in other places.\r\n\r\n{46}in spring, and if we were standing on a woody promontory, with the\r\nsea, and the white sails, and the blue Cyclades beneath us,--and the\r\nportico of a temple peeping through the trees on a huge peak above our\r\nheads,--and thousands of people, with myrtles in their hands, thronging\r\nup the winding path, their gay dresses and garlands disappearing and\r\nemerging by turns as they passed round the angles of the rock,--then\r\nperhaps--\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nNow, by Venus herself, sweet lady, where you are we shall lack neither\r\nsun, nor flowers, nor spring, nor temple, nor goddess.\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA. (Sings.)\r\n\r\n                   Let this sunny hour be given,\r\n\r\n                        Venus, unto love and mirth:\r\n\r\n                   Smiles like thine are in the heaven;\r\n\r\n                        Bloom like thine is on the earth;\r\n\r\n                   And the tinkling of the fountains,\r\n\r\n                        And the murmurs of the sea,\r\n\r\n                   And the echoes from the mountains,\r\n\r\n                   Speak of youth, and hope, and thee.\r\n\r\n                   By whate’er of soft expression\r\n\r\n                        Thou hast taught to lovers’ eyes\r\n\r\n                   Faint denial, slow confession,\r\n\r\n                        Glowing cheeks and stifled sighs;\r\n\r\n                   By the pleasure and the pain,\r\n\r\n                        By the follies and the wiles,\r\n\r\n                   Routing fondness, sweet disdain,\r\n\r\n                        Happy tears and mournful smiles;\r\n\r\n                   Come with music floating o’er thee;\r\n\r\n                        Come with violets springing round:\r\n\r\n                   Let the Graces dance before thee,\r\n\r\n                        All their golden zones unbound;\r\n\r\n                   Now in sport their faces hiding,\r\n\r\n                        Now, with slender fingers fair,\r\n\r\n                   From their laughing eyes dividing\r\n\r\n                        The long curls of rose-crowned hair.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES. {47}Sweetly sung; but mournfully, Chariclea; for which I\r\nwould chide you, but that I am sad myself. More wine there. I wish to\r\nall the gods that I had fairly sailed from Athens.\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nAnd from me, Alcibiades?\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nYes, from you, dear lady. The days which immediately precede separation\r\nare the most melancholy of our lives.\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nExcept those which immediately follow it.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nNo; when I cease to see you, other objects may compel my attention; but\r\ncan I be near you without thinking how lovely you are, and how soon I\r\nmust leave you?\r\n\r\nHIPPOMACHUS.\r\n\r\nAy; travelling soon puts such thoughts out of men’s heads.\r\n\r\nCALLICLES.\r\n\r\nA battle is the best remedy for them.\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nA battle, I should think, might supply their place with others as\r\nunpleasant.\r\n\r\nCALLICLES.\r\n\r\nNo. The preparations are rather disagreeable to a novice. But as soon\r\nas the fighting begins, by Jupiter, it is a noble time;--men\r\ntrampling,--shields {48}clashing,--spears breaking,--and the poan\r\nroaring louder than all.\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nBut what if you are killed?\r\n\r\nCALLICLES.\r\n\r\nWhat indeed? You must ask Speusippus that question. He is a philosopher.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nYes, and the greatest of philosophers, if he can answer it.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nPythagoras is of opinion--\r\n\r\nHIPPOSIACHUS.\r\n\r\nPythagoras stole that and all his other opinions from Asia and Egypt.\r\nThe transmigration of the soul and the vegetable diet are derived from\r\nIndia. I met a Brachman in Sogdiana--\r\n\r\nCALLICLES.\r\n\r\nAll nonsense!\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nWhat think you, Alcibiades?\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nI think that, if the doctrine be true, your spirit will be transfused\r\ninto one of the doves who carry (1) ambrosia to the gods or verses to\r\nthe mistresses of poets. Do you remember Anacreon’s lines? How should\r\nyou like such an office?\r\n\r\n     (1) Homer’s Odyssey, xii. 63.\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA. {49}If I were to be your dove, Alcibiades, and you would\r\ntreat me as Anacreon treated his, and let me nestle in your breast and\r\ndrink from your cup, I would submit even to carry your love-letters to\r\nother ladies.\r\n\r\nCALLICLES.\r\n\r\nWhat, in the name of Jupiter, is the use of all these speculations about\r\ndeath? Socrates once (1) lectured me upon it the best part of a day.\r\nI have hated the sight of him ever since. Such things may suit an old\r\nsophist when he is fasting; but in the midst of wine and music--\r\n\r\nHIPPOMACHUS.\r\n\r\nI differ from you. The enlightened Egyptians bring skeletons into their\r\nbanquets, in order to remind their guests to make the most of their life\r\nwhile they have it.\r\n\r\nCALLICLES.\r\n\r\nI want neither skeleton nor sophist to teach me that lesson. More wine,\r\nI pray you, and less wisdom. If you must believe something which you\r\nnever can know why not be contented with the long stories about\r\nthe other world which are told us when we are initiated at the (2 )\r\nEleusinian mysteries.\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nAnd what are those stories?\r\n\r\n     (1)See the close of Plato’s Gorgias.\r\n\r\n     (2) The scene which follows is founded upon history.\r\n     Thucydides tells us, in his sixth book, that about this time\r\n     Alcibiades was suspected of having assisted at a mock\r\n     celebration of these famous mysteries. It was the opinion of\r\n     the vulgar among the Athenians that extraordinary privileges\r\n     were granted in the other world to all who had been\r\n     initiated.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\n{50}Are not you initiated, Chariclea?\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nNo; My mother was a Lydian, a barbarian; and therefore--\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nI understand. Now the curse of Venus on the fools who made so hateful a\r\nlaw. Speusippus, does not your friend Euripides (1) say--\r\n\r\n               “The land where thou art prosperous is thy country?\"\r\n\r\nSurely we ought to say to every lady\r\n\r\n               “The land where thou art pretty is thy country.\"\r\n\r\nBesides, to exclude foreign beauties from the chorus of the initiated in\r\nthe Elysian fields is less cruel to them than to ourselves. Chariclea,\r\nyou shall be initiated.\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nWhen?\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nNow.\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nWhere?\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nHere.\r\n\r\nCHARICLEA.\r\n\r\nDelightful!\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nBut there must be an interval of a year between the purification and the\r\ninitiation.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nWe will suppose all that.\r\n\r\n     (1) The right of Euripides to this line is somewhat\r\n     disputable. See Aristophanes; Plutus, 1152.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\n{51}And nine days of rigid mortification of the senses.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nWe will suppose that too. I am sure it was supposed, with as little\r\nreason, when I was initiated.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nBut you are sworn to secrecy.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nYou a sophist, and talk of oaths! You a pupil of Euripides, and forget\r\nhis maxims!\r\n\r\n               “My lips have sworn it; but my mind is free.” (1)\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nBut Alcibiades----\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nWhat! Are you afraid of Ceres and Proserpine?\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nNo--but--but--I--that is I--but it is best to be safe--I mean--Suppose\r\nthere should be something in it.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nNow, by Mercury, I shall die with laughing. Oh Speusippus, Speusippus!\r\nGo back to your old father. Dig vineyards, and judge causes, and be a\r\nrespectable citizen. But never, while you live, again dream of being a\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nNay, I was only----\r\n\r\n     (1)See Euripides; Hyppolytus, 606. For the jesuitical\r\n     morality of this line Euripides is bitterly attacked by the\r\n     comic poet.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\n{52}A pupil of Gorgias and Melesigenes afraid of Tartarus! In what\r\nregion of the infernal world do you expect your domicile to be fixed?\r\nShall you roll a stone like Sisyphus? Hard exercise, Speusippus!\r\n\r\nSPEUSIFPUS.\r\n\r\nIn the name of all the gods--\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nOr shall you sit starved and thirsty in the midst of fruit and wine like\r\nTantalus? Poor fellow! I think I see your face as you are springing up\r\nto the branches and missing your aim. Oh Bacchus! Oh Mercury!\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nAlcibiades!\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps you will be food for a vulture, like the huge fellow who was\r\nrude to Latona.\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS.\r\n\r\nAlcibiades!\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nNever fear. Minos will not be so cruel. Your eloquence will triumph\r\nover all accusations. The furies will skulk away like disappointed\r\nsycophants. Only address the judges of hell in the speech which you were\r\nprevented from speaking last assembly. When I consider--is not that\r\nthe beginning of it? Come, man, do not be angry. Why do you pace up\r\nand down with such long steps? You are not in Tartarus yet. You seem to\r\nthink that you are already stalking like poor Achilles,\r\n\r\n                        “With stride\r\n\r\n               “Majestic through the plain of Asphodel.” (1)\r\n\r\nSPEÜSIPPÜS. {53}How can you talk so, when you know that I believe all\r\nthat foolery as little as you do?\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nThen march. You shall be the crier. (2) Callicles, you shall carry the\r\ntorch. Why do you stare?\r\n\r\nCALLICLES.\r\n\r\nI do not much like the frolic.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n\r\nNay, surely you are not taken with a fit of piety. If all be true that\r\nis told of you, you have as little reason to think the gods vindictive\r\nas any man breathing. If you be not belied, a certain golden goblet\r\nwhich I have seen at your house was once in the temple of Juno at\r\nCorcyra. And men say that there was a priestess at Tarentum----\r\n\r\nCALLICLES.\r\n\r\nA fig for the gods! I was thinking about the Archons. You will have an\r\naccusation laid against you to-morrow. It is not very pleasant to be\r\ntried before the king.

DANTE.\r\n\r\n               “Fairest of stars, last in the train of night\r\n\r\n               If better thou belong not to the dawn,\r\n\r\n               Sure pledge of day, that crown’st the smiling morn\r\n\r\n               With thy bright circlet.”\r\n\r\n                             Milton.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a review of Italian literature, Dante has a double claim to\r\nprecedency. He was the earliest and the greatest writer of his country.\r\nHe was the first man who fully descried and exhibited the powers of\r\nhis native dialect. The Latin tongue, which, under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, and in the hands of the greatest masters, had still been\r\npoor, feeble, and singularly unpoetical, and which had, in the age of\r\nDante, been debased by the admixture of innumerable barbarous words\r\nand idioms, was still cultivated with superstitious veneration, and\r\nreceived, in the last stage of corruption, more honours than it had\r\ndeserved in the period of its life and vigour. It was the language of\r\nthe cabinet, of the university, of the church. It was employed by all\r\nwho aspired to distinction in the higher walks of poetry. In compassion\r\nto the ignorance of his mistress, a cavalier might now and then proclaim\r\nhis passion in Tuscan or Provençal rhymes. The vulgar might occasionally\r\nbe edified by a pious {56}allegory in the popular jargon. But no writer\r\nhad conceived it possible that the dialect of peasants and market-women\r\nshould possess sufficient energy and precision for a majestic and\r\ndurable work. Dante adventured first. He detected the rich treasures of\r\nthought and diction which still lay latent in their ore. He refined them\r\ninto purity. He burnished them into splendour. He fitted them for every\r\npurpose of use and magnificence. And he has thus acquired the glory, not\r\nonly of producing the finest narrative poem of modern times, but also of\r\ncreating a language, distinguished by unrivalled melody, and peculiarly\r\ncapable of furnishing to lofty and passionate thoughts their appropriate\r\ngarb of severe and concise expression.\r\n\r\nTo many this may appear a singular panegyric on the Italian tongue.\r\nIndeed the great majority of the young gentlemen and young ladies, who,\r\nwhen they are asked whether they read Italian, answer “Yes,” never go\r\nbeyond the stories at the end of their grammar,--The Pastor Fido,--or an\r\nact of Artaserse. They could as soon read a Babylonian brick as a canto\r\nof Dante. Hence it is a general opinion, among those who know little\r\nor nothing of the subject, that this admirable language is adapted only\r\nto the effeminate cant of sonnetteers, musicians, and connoisseurs.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that Dante and Petrarch have been the Oromasdes and\r\nArimanes of Italian literature. I wish not to detract from the merits\r\nof Petrarch. No one can doubt that his poems exhibit, amidst some\r\nimbecility and more affectation, much elegance, ingenuity, and\r\ntenderness. They present us with a mixture which can only be compared to\r\nthe whimsical concert described by the humorous poet of Modena:\r\n\r\n               “S’udian gli usignuoli, al primo albore,\r\n\r\n               E gli asiui eantar versi d’ amore.” (1)\r\n\r\n{57}I am not, however, at present speaking of the intrinsic excellencies\r\nof his writings, which I shall take another opportunity to examine, hut\r\nof the effect which they produce on the literature of Italy. The florid\r\nand luxurious charms of his style enticed the poets and the public from\r\nthe contemplation of nobler and sterner models. In truth, though a\r\nrude state of society is that in which great original works are\r\nmost frequently produced, it is also that in which they are worst\r\nappreciated. This may appear paradoxical, but it is proved by\r\nexperience, and is consistent with reason. To be without any received\r\ncanons of taste is good for the few who can create, but bad for the many\r\nwho can only imitate and judge. Great and active minds cannot remain at\r\nrest. In a cultivated age they are too often contented to move on in\r\nthe beaten path. But where no path exists they will make one. Thus\r\nthe Iliad, the Odyssey, the Divine Comedy, appeared in dark and half\r\nbarbarous times: and thus of the few original works which have been\r\nproduced in more polished ages, we owe a large proportion to men in low\r\nstations and of uninformed minds. I will instance, in our own language,\r\nthe Pilgrim’s Progress and Robinson Crusoe. Of all the prose works of\r\nfiction which we possess, these are, I will not say the best, but the\r\nmost peculiar, the most unprecedented, the most inimitable. Had Bunyan\r\nand Defoe been educated gentlemen, they would probably have published\r\ntranslations and imitations of French romances “by a person of quality.”\r\n I am not sure that we should have had Lear if Shakspeare had been able\r\nto read Sophocles.\r\n\r\n     (1) Tassoni; Seccliia Rapita, canto i. stanza G.\r\n\r\n{58}But these circumstances, while they foster genius, are unfavourable\r\nto the science of criticism. Men judge by comparison. They are unable\r\nto estimate the grandeur of an object when there is no standard by which\r\nthey can measure it. One of the French philosophers (I beg Gerard’s\r\npardon), who accompanied Napoleon to Egypt, tells us that, when he first\r\nvisited the great Pyramid, he was surprised to see it so diminutive. It\r\nstood alone in a boundless plain. There was nothing near it from which\r\nhe could calculate its magnitude. But when the camp was pitched beside\r\nit, and the tents appeared like diminutive specks around its base, he\r\nthen perceived the immensity of this mightiest work of man. In the same\r\nmanner, it is not till a crowd of petty writers has sprung up that the\r\nmerit of the great master-spirits of literature is understood.\r\n\r\nWe have indeed ample proof that Dante was highly admired in his own and\r\nthe following age. I wish that we had equal proof that he was admired\r\nfor his excellencies. But it is a remarkable corroboration of what has\r\nbeen said, that this great man seems to have been utterly unable to\r\nappreciate himself. In his treatise _De Vulgari Eloquentia_, he talks\r\nwith satisfaction of what he has done for Italian literature, of the\r\npurity and correctness of his style. “_Cependant_,” says a favourite\r\n(1) writer of mine, “_il ri est ni pur, ni correct, mais il est\r\ncréateur.”_Considering the difficulties with which Dante had to\r\nstruggle, we may perhaps be more inclined than the French critic to\r\nallow him this praise. Still it is by no means his highest or most\r\npeculiar title to applause. It is scarcely necessary to say that those\r\nqualities which escaped the notice of the poet himself were not likely\r\nto attract the attention of the commentators. The fact is, that, while\r\nthe\r\n\r\n     (1) Sismondi; Littérature du Midi de l’ Europe.\r\n\r\n{59}public homage was paid to some absurdities with which his works\r\nmay be justly charged, and to many more which were falsely imputed to\r\nthem,--while lecturers were paid to expound and eulogise his physics,\r\nhis metaphysics, his theology, all bad of their kind,--while annotators\r\nlaboured to detect allegorical meanings of which the author never\r\ndreamed, the great powers of his imagination, and the incomparable force\r\nof his style, were neither admired nor imitated. Arimanes had prevailed.\r\nThe Divine Comedy was to that age what St. Paul’s Cathedral was to Omai.\r\nThe poor Otaheitean stared listlessly for a moment at the huge cupola,\r\nand ran into a toyshop to play with beads. Italy, too, was charmed with\r\nliterary trinkets, and played with them for four centuries.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Petrarch to the appearance of Alfieri’s tragedies, we\r\nmay trace in almost every page of Italian literature the influence of\r\nthose celebrated sonnets which, from the nature both of their beauties\r\nand their faults, were peculiarly unfit to be models for general\r\nimitation. Almost all the poets of that period, however different in\r\nthe degree and quality of their talents, are characterised by great\r\nexaggeration, and, as a necessary consequence, great coldness of\r\nsentiment; by a passion for frivolous and tawdry ornament; and, above\r\nall, by an extreme feebleness and diffuseness of style. Tasso, Marino,\r\nGuarini, Metastasio, and a crowd of writers of inferior merit and\r\ncelebrity, were spell-bound in the enchanted gardens of a gaudy and\r\nmeretricious Alcina, who concealed debility and deformity beneath the\r\ndeceitful semblance of loveliness and health. Ariosto, the great Ariosto\r\nhimself, like his own Ruggiero, stooped for a time to linger amidst\r\nthe magic flowers and fountains, and to caress the gay {60}and painted\r\nsorceress. But to him, as to his own Ruggiero, had been given the\r\nomnipotent ring and the winged courser, which bore him from the paradise\r\nof deception to the regions of light and nature.\r\n\r\nThe evil of which I speak was not confined to the graver poets. It\r\ninfected satire, comedy, burlesque. No person can admire more than I do\r\nthe great masterpieces of wit and humour which Italy has produced. Still\r\nI cannot but discern and lament a great deficiency, which is common to\r\nthem all. I find in them abundance of ingenuity, of droll naïveté, of\r\nprofound and just reflection, of happy expression. Manners, characters,\r\nopinions, are treated with “a most learned spirit of human dealing.” But\r\nsomething is still wanting. We read, and we admire, and we yawn. We look\r\nin vain for the bacchanalian fury which inspired the comedy of Athens,\r\nfor the fierce and withering scorn which animates the invectives of\r\nJuvenal and Dryden, or even for the compact and pointed diction which\r\nadds zest to the verses of Pope and Boileau. There is no enthusiasm,\r\nno energy, no condensation, nothing which springs from strong\r\nfeeling, nothing which tends to excite it. Many fine thoughts and fine\r\nexpressions reward the toil of reading. Still it is a toil. The Secchia\r\nRapita, in some points the best poem of its kind, is painfully diffuse\r\nand languid. The Animali Parlanti of Casti is perfectly intolerable. I\r\nadmire the dexterity of the plot, and the liberality of the opinions.\r\nI admit that it is impossible to turn to a page which does not contain\r\nsomething that deserves to be remembered; but it is at least six times\r\nas long as it ought to be. And the garrulous feebleness of the style is\r\na still greater fault than the length of the work.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that I have gone too far in attributing {61}these\r\nevils to the influence of the works and the fame of Petrarch. It cannot,\r\nhowever, be doubted that they have arisen, in a great measure, from a\r\nneglect of the style of Dante. This is not more proved by the decline\r\nof Italian poetry than by its resuscitation. After the lapse of four\r\nhundred and fifty years, there appeared a man capable of appreciating\r\nand imitating the father of Tuscan literature--Vittorio Alfieri. Like\r\nthe prince in the nursery tale, he sought and found the Sleeping Beauty\r\nwithin the recesses which had so long concealed her from mankind. The\r\nportal was indeed rusted by time;--the dust of ages had accumulated on\r\nthe banonnors;--the furniture was of antique fashion;--and the gorgeous\r\ncolour of the embroidery had faded. But the living charms which were\r\nwell worth all the rest remained in the bloom of eternal youth, and well\r\nrewarded the bold adventurer who roused them from their long slumber. In\r\nevery line of the Philip and the Saul, the greatest poems, I think, of\r\nthe eighteenth century, we may trace the influence of that mighty\r\ngenius which has immortalised the ill-starred love of Francesca, and\r\nthe paternal agonies of Ugolino. Alfieri bequeathed the sovereignty of\r\nItalian literature to the author of the Aristodemus--a man of genius\r\nscarcely inferior to his own, and a still more devoted disciple of the\r\ngreat Florentine. It must be acknowledged that this eminent writer has\r\nsometimes pushed too far his idolatry of Dante. To borrow a sprightly\r\nillustration from Sir John Denham, he has not only imitated his garb,\r\nbut borrowed his clothes. He often quotes his phrases; and he has,\r\nnot very judiciously as it appears to me, imitated his versification.\r\nNevertheless, he has displayed many of the higher excellencies of his\r\nmaster; {62}and his works may justly inspire us with a hope that Italian\r\nlanguage will long flourish under a new literary dynasty, or rather\r\nunder the legitimate line, which has at length been restored to a throne\r\nlong occupied by specious usurpers.\r\n\r\nThe man to whom the literature of his country owes its origin and\r\nits revival was horn in times singularly adapted to call forth his\r\nextraordinary powers. Religious zeal, chivalrous love and honour,\r\ndemocratic liberty, are the three most powerful principles that have\r\never influenced the character of large masses of men. Each of them\r\nsingly has often excited the greatest enthusiasm, and produced the\r\nmost important changes. In the time of Dante all the three, often in\r\namalgamation, generally in conflict, agitated the public mind. The\r\npreceding generation had witnessed the wrongs and the revenge of the\r\nbrave, the accomplished, the unfortunate Emperor Frederic the Second,--a\r\npoet in an age of schoolmen,--a philosopher in an age of monks,--a\r\nstatesman in an age of crusaders. During the whole life of the poet,\r\nItaly was experiencing the consequences of the memorable struggle which\r\nhe had maintained against the Church. The finest works of imagination\r\nhave always been produced in times of political convulsion, as the\r\nrichest vineyards and the sweetest flowers always grow on the soil which\r\nhas been fertilised by the fiery deluge of a volcano. To look no\r\nfurther than the literary history of our own country, can we doubt\r\nthat Shakspeare was in a great measure produced by the Reformation,\r\nand Wordsworth by the French Revolution? Poets often avoid political\r\ntransactions; they often affect to despise them. But, whether they\r\nperceive it or not, they must be influenced by them. As long as their\r\nminds have any {63}point of contact with those of their fellow-men,\r\nthe electric impulse, at whatever distance it may originate, will he\r\ncircuitously communicated to them.\r\n\r\nThis will be the case even in large societies, where the division of\r\nlabour enables many speculative men to observe the face of nature, or\r\nto analyse their own minds, at a distance from the seat of political\r\ntransactions. In the little republic of which Dante was a member the\r\nstate of things was very different. These small communities are most\r\nunmercifully abused by most of our modern professors of the science\r\nof government. In such states, they tell us, factions are always\r\nmost violent: where both parties are cooped up within a narrow space,\r\npolitical difference necessarily produces personal malignity. Every man\r\nmust be a soldier; every moment may produce a war. No citizen can lie\r\ndown secure that he shall not be roused by the alarum-bell, to repel\r\nor avenge an injury. In such petty quarrels Greece squandered the blood\r\nwhich might have purchased for her the permanent empire of the world,\r\nand Italy wasted the energy and the abilities which would have enabled\r\nher to defend her independence against the Pontiffs and the Cæsars.\r\n\r\nAll this is true: yet there is still a compensation. Mankind has not\r\nderived so much benefit from the empire of Rome as from the city of\r\nAthens, nor from the kingdom of France as from the city of Florence.\r\nThe violence of party feeling may be an evil; but it calls forth that\r\nactivity of mind which in some states of society it is desirable to\r\nproduce at any expense. Universal soldiership may be an evil; but where\r\nevery man is a soldier there will be no standing army. And is it no evil\r\nthat one man in every fifty should be bred to the trade of slaughter;\r\nshould live only by destroying {64}and by exposing himself to be\r\ndestroyed; should fight without enthusiasm and conquer without glory; be\r\nsent to a hospital when wounded, and rot on a dunghill when old? Such,\r\nover more than two-thirds of Europe, is the fate of soldiers. It was\r\nsomething that the citizen of Milan or Florence fought, not merely in\r\nthe vague and rhetorical sense in which the words are often used, but\r\nin sober truth, for his parents, his children, his lands, his house,\r\nhis altars. It was something that he marched forth to battle beneath the\r\nCarroccio, which had been the object of his childish veneration; that\r\nhis aged father looked down from the battlements on his exploits; that\r\nhis friends and his rivals were the witnesses of his glory. If he fell,\r\nhe was consigned to no venal or heedless guardians. The same day saw him\r\nconveyed within the walls which he had defended. His wounds were dressed\r\nby his mother; his confession was whispered to the friendly priest\r\nwho had heard and absolved the follies of his youth; his last sigh was\r\nbreathed upon the lips of the lady of his love. Surely there is no sword\r\nlike that which is beaten out of a ploughshare. Surely this state of\r\nthings was not unmixedly bad: its evils were alleviated by enthusiasm\r\nand by tenderness; and it will at least be acknowledged that it was well\r\nfitted to nurse poetical genius in an imaginative and observant mind.\r\n\r\nNor did the religious spirit of the age tend less to this result than\r\nits political circumstances. Fanaticism is an evil, but it is not the\r\ngreatest of evils. It is good that a people should be roused by any\r\nmeans from a state of utter torpor;--that their minds should be diverted\r\nfrom objects merely sensual, to meditations, however erroneous, on the\r\nmysteries of the moral and intellectual world; and from interests which\r\nare immediately {65}selfish to those which relate to the past, the\r\nfuture, and the remote. These effects have sometimes been produced by\r\nthe worst superstitions that ever existed; but the Catholic religion,\r\neven in the time of its utmost extravagance and atrocity, never wholly\r\nlost the spirit of the Great Teacher, whose precepts form the noblest\r\ncode, as his conduct furnished the purest example, of moral excellence.\r\nIt is of all religions the most poetical. The ancient superstitions\r\nfurnished the fancy with beautiful images, but took no hold on the\r\nheart. The doctrines of the Reformed Churches have most powerfully\r\ninfluenced the feelings and the conduct of men, but have not presented\r\nthem with visions of sensible beauty and grandeur. The Roman Catholic\r\nChurch has united to the awful doctrines of the one what Mr. Coleridge\r\ncalls the “fair humanities” of the other. It has enriched sculpture\r\nand painting with the loveliest and most majestic forms. To the Phidian\r\nJupiter it can oppose the Moses of Michael Angelo; and to the voluptuous\r\nbeauty of the Queen of Cyprus, the serene and pensive loveliness of\r\nthe Virgin Mother. The legends of its martyrs and its saints may vie\r\nin ingenuity and interest with the mythological fables of Greece; its\r\nceremonies and processions were the delight of the vulgar; the huge\r\nfabric of secular power with which it was connected attracted the\r\nadmiration of the statesman. At the same time, it never lost sight of\r\nthe most solemn and tremendous doctrines of Christianity,--the incarnate\r\nGod,--the judgment,--the retribution,--the eternity of happiness\r\nor torment. Thus, while, like the ancient religions, it received\r\nincalculable support from policy and ceremony, it never wholly became,\r\nlike those religions, a merely political and ceremonial institution.\r\n\r\n{66}The beginning of the thirteenth century was, as Machiarelli has\r\nremarked, the era of a great revival of this extraordinary system. The\r\npolicy of Innocent,--the growth of the inquisition and the mendicant\r\norders,--the wars against the Albigenses, the Pagans of the East, and\r\nthe unfortunate princes of the house of Swabia, agitated Italy during\r\nthe two following generations. In this point Dante was completely\r\nunder the influence of his age. He was a man of a turbid and melancholy\r\nspirit. In early youth he had entertained a strong and unfortunate\r\npassion, which, long after the death of her whom he loved, continued to\r\nhaunt him. Dissipation, ambition, misfortunes had not effaced it. He was\r\nnot only a sincere, but a passionate, believer. The crimes and abuses\r\nof the Church of Pome were indeed loathsome to him; but to all its\r\ndoctrines and all its rites he adhered with enthusiastic fondness and\r\nveneration; and, at length, driven from nis native country, reduced to\r\na situation the most painful to a man of his disposition, condemned\r\nto learn by experience that no (1) food is so bitter as the bread of\r\ndependence, and no ascent so painful as the staircase of a patron,--his\r\nwounded spirit took refuge in visionary devotion. Beatrice, the\r\nunforgotten object of his early tenderness, was invested by his\r\nimagination with glorious and mysterious attributes; she was enthroned\r\namong the highest of the celestial hierarchy: Almighty Wisdom had\r\nassigned to her the care of the sinful and unhappy wanderer who had\r\nloved her with such a perfect love. (2) By a confusion, like that which\r\noften\r\n\r\n                   (1)\"Tu proverai si come sa di sale\r\n\r\n                   Lo pane altrui, e come è duro calle\r\n\r\n                   Lo scendere c’l salir per l’ altrui scale.”\r\n\r\n                             Parndiso, canto xvii.\r\n\r\n     (2) “L’ amico mio, e non della ventura.”--_Inferno_, canto\r\n     ii.\r\n\r\n{67}takes place in dreams, he has sometimes lost sight of her human\r\nnature, and even of her personal existence, and seems to consider her as\r\none of the attributes of the Deity.\r\n\r\nBut those religious hopes which had released the mind of the sublime\r\nenthusiast from the terrors of death had not rendered his speculations\r\non human life more cheerful. This is an inconsistency which may often be\r\nobserved in men of a similar temperament. He hoped for happiness beyond\r\nthe grave: but he felt none on earth. It is from this cause, more than\r\nfrom any other, that his description of Heaven is so far inferior to the\r\nHell or the Purgatory. With the passions and miseries of the suffering\r\nspirits he feels a strong sympathy. But among the beatified he appears\r\nas one who has nothing in common with them,--as one who is incapable of\r\ncomprehending, not only the degree, but the nature of their enjoyment.\r\nWe think that we see him standing; amidst those smiling; and radiant\r\nspirits with that scowl of unutterable misery on his brow, and that curl\r\nof bitter disdain on his lips, which all his portraits have preserved\r\nand which might furnish Chantrey with hints for the head of his\r\nprojected Satan.\r\n\r\nThere is no poet whose intellectual and moral character are so closely\r\nconnected. The great source, as it appears to me, of the power of the\r\nDivine Comedy is the strong belief with which the story seems to be\r\ntold. In this respect, the only books which approach to its excellence\r\nare Gulliver’s Travels and Robinson Crusoe. The solemnity of his\r\nasseverations, the consistency and minuteness of his details, the\r\nearnestness with which he labors to make the reader understand the exact\r\nshape and size of every thing that he describes, give an air of reality\r\nto his wildest fictions. {68}I should only weaken this statement by\r\nquoting instances of a feeling which pervades the whole work, and to\r\nwhich it owes much of its fascination. This is the real justification\r\nof the many passages in his poem which had critics have condemned as\r\ngrotesque. I am concerned to see that Mr. Cary, to whom Dante owes more\r\nthan ever poet owed to translator, has sanctioned an accusation utterly\r\nunworthy of his abilities. “His solicitude,” says that gentleman, “to\r\ndefine all his images in such a manner as to bring them within the\r\ncircle of our vision, and to subject them to the power of the pencil,\r\nrenders him little better than grotesque, where Milton has since taught\r\nus to expect sublimity.” It is true that Dante has never shrunk from\r\nembodying his conceptions in determinate words, that he has even given\r\nmeasures and numbers, where Milton would have left his images to float\r\nundefined in a gorgeous haze of language. Both were right. Milton\r\ndid not profess to have been in heaven or hell. He might therefore\r\nreasonably confine himself to magnificent generalities. Far different\r\nwas the office of the lonely traveller, who had wandered through the\r\nnations of the dead. Had he described the abode of the rejected spirits\r\nin language resembling the splendid lines of the English poet,--had he\r\ntold us of--\r\n\r\n               “An universe of death, which God by curse\r\n\r\n               Created evil, for evil only good,\r\n\r\n               Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds\r\n\r\n               Perverse all monstrous, all prodigious tilings,\r\n\r\n               Abominable, unutterable, and worse\r\n\r\n               Than fables yet have feigned, or fear conceived,\r\n\r\n               Gorgons, and hydras, and chimæras dire,”--\r\n\r\nthis would doubtless have been noble writing. But where would have been\r\nthat strong impression of {69}reality, which, in accordance with his\r\nplan, it should have been his great object to produce? It was absolutely\r\nnecessary for him to delineate accurately “all monstrous, all prodigious\r\nthings,”--to utter what might to others appear “unutterable,”--to relate\r\nwith the air of truth what fables had never feigned,--to embody what\r\nfear had never conceived. And I will frankly confess that the vague\r\nsublimity of Milton affects me less than these reviled details of Dante.\r\nWe read Milton; and we know that we are reading a great poet. When\r\nwe read Dante, the poet vanishes. We are listening to the man who has\r\nreturned from the valley of the “dolorous abyss;” (1)--we seem to see\r\nthe dilated eye of horror, to hear the shuddering accents with which\r\nhe tells his fearful tale. Considered in this light, the narratives are\r\nexactly what they should be,--definite in themselves, but suggesting to\r\nthe mind ideas of awful and indefinite wonder. They are made up of the\r\nimages of the earth:--they are told in the language of the earth.--Yet\r\nthe whole effect is, beyond expression, wild and unearthly. The fact\r\nis, that supernatural beings, as long as they are considered merely with\r\nreference to their own nature, excite our feelings very feebly. It is\r\nwhen the great gulf which separates them from us is passed, when we\r\nsuspect some strange and un definable relation between the laws of the\r\nvisible and the invisible world, that they rouse, perhaps, the strongest\r\nemotions of which our nature is capable. How many children, and how many\r\nmen, are afraid of ghosts, who are not afraid of God! And this, because,\r\nthough they entertain a much stronger conviction of the existence of a\r\nDeity than of the reality of apparitions, they have no\r\n\r\n     (1) “La valle d’ abisso doloroso.”--_Inferno_, canto iv.\r\n\r\n{70}apprehension that he will manifest himself to them in any sensible\r\nmanner. While this is the case, to describe super-human beings in the\r\nlanguage, and to attribute to them the actions, of humanity may be\r\ngrotesque, unphilosophical, inconsistent; but it will be the only\r\nmode of working upon the feelings of men, and, therefore, the only mode\r\nsuited for poetry. Shakspeare understood this well, as he understood\r\nevery thing that belonged to his art. Who does not sympathise with\r\nthe rapture of Ariel, flying after sunset on the wings of the bat, or\r\nsucking in the cups of flowers with the bee? Who does not shudder at the\r\ncaldron of Macbeth? Where is the philosopher who is not moved when he\r\nthinks of the strange connection between the infernal spirits and “the\r\nsow’s blood that hath eaten her nine farrow?” But this difficult task of\r\nrepresenting supernatural beings to our minds, in a manner which shall\r\nbe neither unintelligible to our intellects, nor wholly inconsistent\r\nwith our ideas of their nature, has never been so well performed as by\r\nDante. I will refer to three instances, which are, perhaps, the most\r\nstriking---the description of the transformations of the serpents and\r\nthe robbers, in the twenty-fifth canto of the Inferno,--the passage\r\nconcerning Nimrod, in the thirty-first canto of the same part,--and the\r\nmagnificent procession in the twenty-ninth canto of the Purgatorio.\r\n\r\nThe metaphors and comparisons of Dante harmonise admirably with that\r\nair of strong reality of which I have spoken. They have a very peculiar\r\ncharacter. He is perhaps the only poet whose writings would become much\r\nless intelligible if all illustrations of this sort were expunged. His\r\nsimiles are frequently rather those of a traveller than of a poet.\r\nHe employs them {71}not to display his ingenuity by fanciful\r\nanalogies,--not to delight the reader by affording him a distant and\r\npassing glimpse of beautiful images remote from the path in which he\r\nis proceeding,--but to give an exact idea of the objects which he is\r\ndescribing, by comparing them with others generally known. The boiling\r\npitch in Malebolge was like that in the Venetian arsenal:--the mound on\r\nwhich he travelled along the banks of Phlegethon was like that between\r\nGhent and Bruges, but not so large:--the cavities where the Simoniacal\r\nprelates are confined resembled the fonts in the Church of John at\r\nFlorence. Every reader of Dante will recall many other illustrations\r\nof this description, which add to the appearance of sincerity and\r\nearnestness from winch the narrative derives so much of its interest.\r\n\r\nMany of his comparisons, again, are intended to give an exact idea of\r\nhis feelings under particular circumstances. The delicate shades of\r\ngrief, of fear, of anger, are rarely discriminated with sufficient\r\naccuracy in the language of the most refined nations. A rude dialect\r\nnever abounds in nice distinctions of this kind. Dante therefore employs\r\nthe most accurate and infinitely the most poetical mode of marking\r\nthe precise state of his mind. Every person who has experienced the\r\nbewildering effect of sudden bad tidings,--the stupefaction,--the vague\r\ndoubt of the truth of our own perceptions which they produce,--will\r\nunderstand the following simile:--“I was as he is who dreameth his own\r\nharm,--who, dreaming, wishes that it may be all a dream, so that he\r\ndesires that which is as though it were not.” This is only one out of a\r\nhundred equally striking and expressive similitudes. The comparisons of\r\nHomer and Milton are magnificent digressions. It scarcely injures\r\ntheir effect to detach {72}them from the work. Those of Dante are very\r\ndifferent. They derive their beauty from the context, and reflect beauty\r\nupon it. His embroidery cannot be taken out without spoiling the whole\r\nweb. I cannot dismiss this part of the subject without advising every\r\nperson who can muster sufficient Italian to read the smile of the\r\nsheep, in the third canto of the Purgatorio. I think it the most\r\nperfect passage of the kind in the world, the most imaginative, the most\r\npicturesque, and the most sweetly expressed.\r\n\r\nNo person can have attended to the Divine Comedy without observing how\r\nlittle impression the forms of the external world appear to have made on\r\nthe mind of Dante. His temper and his situation had led him to fix his\r\nobservation almost exclusively on human nature. The exquisite opening\r\nof the eighth (1) canto of the Purgatorio affords a strong instance\r\nof this. He leaves to others the earth, the ocean, and the sky. His\r\nbusiness is with man. To other writers, evening may be the season of\r\ndews and stars and radiant clouds. To Dante it is the hour of fond\r\nrecollection and passionate devotion,--the hour which melts the heart of\r\nthe mariner and kindles the love of the pilgrim,--the hour when the toll\r\nof the bell seems to mourn for another day which is gone and will return\r\nno more.\r\n\r\n     (1) I cannot help observing that Gray’s imitation of that\r\n     noble line “Che paia’l giorno pianger che si muore,” is one\r\n     of the most striking instances of injudicious plagiarism\r\n     with which I am acquainted. Dante did not put this strong\r\n     personification at the beginning of his description. The\r\n     imagination of the reader is so well prepared for it by the\r\n     previous lines, that it appears perfectly natural and\r\n     pathetic. Placed as Gray has placed it, neither preceded nor\r\n     followed by any thing that harmonises with it, it becomes a\r\n     frigid conceit. Woe to the unskilful rider who ventures on\r\n     the horses of Achilles.\r\n\r\n{73}The feeling of the present age has taken a direction diametrically\r\nopposite. The magnificence of the physical world, and its influence\r\nupon the human mind, have been the favourite themes of our most eminent\r\npoets. The herd of blue-stocking ladies and sonneteering gentlemen seem\r\nto consider a strong sensibility to the “splendour of the grass, the\r\nglory of the flower,” as an ingredient absolutely indispensable in the\r\nformation of a poetical mind. They treat with contempt all writers who\r\nare unfortunately\r\n\r\n                        nec ponere lucurn\r\n\r\n               Artifices, nec rus saturum laudare.\r\n\r\nThe orthodox poetical creed is more Catholic. The noblest earthly object\r\nof the contemplation of man is man himself. The universe, and all its\r\nfair and glorious forais, are indeed included in the wide empire of the\r\nimagination; but she has placed her home and her sanctuary amidst the\r\ninexhaustible varieties and the impenetrable mysteries of the mind.\r\n\r\n               In tutte parti impera, e quivi regge;\r\n\r\n               Quivi è la sua cittade, e l’ alto seggio. (1)\r\n\r\nOthello is perhaps the greatest work in the world. From what does it\r\nderive its power? From the clouds? From the ocean? From the mountains?\r\nOr from love strong as death, and jealousy cruel as the grave! What is\r\nit that we go forth to see in Hamlet? Is it a reed shaken with the wind?\r\nA small celandine? A bed of daffodils? Or is it to contemplate a mighty\r\nand wayward mind laid bare before us to the inmost recesses? It may\r\nperhaps be doubted whether the lakes and the hills are better fitted for\r\nthe education of a poet than the dusky streets of a huge capital. Indeed\r\nwho is not tired to death with pure description of\r\n\r\n     (1) Inferno, canto i.\r\n\r\n{74}scenery? Is it not the fact, that external objects never strongly\r\nexcite our feelings but when they are contemplated in reference to man,\r\nas illustrating his destiny, or as influencing his character? The most\r\nbeautiful object in the world, it will be allowed, is a beautiful woman.\r\nBut who that can analyse his feelings is not sensible that she owes her\r\nfascination less to grace of outline and delicacy of colour, than to\r\na thousand associations which, often unperceived by ourselves, connect\r\nthose qualities with the source of our existence, with the nourishment\r\nof our infancy, with the passions of our youth, with the hopes of our\r\nage, with elegance, with vivacity, with tenderness, with the strongest\r\nof natural instincts, with the dearest of social ties?\r\n\r\nTo those who think thus, the insensibility of the Florentine poet to\r\nthe beauties of nature will not appear an unpardonable deficiency. On\r\nmankind no writer, with the exception of Shakspeare, has looked with\r\na more penetrating eye. I have said that his poetical character had\r\nderived a tinge from his peculiar temper. It is on the sterner and\r\ndarker passions that he delights to dwell. All love, excepting the half\r\nmystic passion which he still felt for his buried Beatrice, had palled\r\non the fierce and restless exile. The sad story of Rimini is almost a\r\nsingle exception. I know not whether it has been remarked, that, in one\r\npoint, misanthropy seems to have affected his mind as it did that of\r\nSwift. Nauseous and revolting images seem to have had a fascination\r\nfor his mind; and he repeatedly places before his readers, with all\r\nthe energy of his incomparable style, the most loathsome objects of the\r\nsewer and the dissecting-room.\r\n\r\nThere is another peculiarity in the poem of Dante, which, I think,\r\ndeserves notice. Ancient mythology {75}has hardly ever been successfully\r\ninterwoven with modern poetry. One class of writers have introduced the\r\nfabulous deities merely as allegorical representatives of love, wine,\r\nor wisdom. This necessarily renders their works tame and cold. We may\r\nsometimes admire their ingenuity; but with what interest can we read\r\nof beings of whose personal existence the writer does not suffer us\r\nto entertain, for a moment, even a conventional belief? Even Spenser’s\r\nallegory is scarcely tolerable, till we contrive to forget that Una\r\nsignifies innocence, and consider her merely as an oppressed lady under\r\nthe protection of a generous knight.\r\n\r\nThose writers who have, more judiciously, attempted to preserve the\r\npersonality of the classical divinities have failed from a different\r\ncause. They have been imitators, and imitators at a disadvantage;\r\nEuripides and Catullus believed in Bacchus and Cybele as little as we\r\ndo. But they lived among men who did. Their imaginations, if not their\r\nopinions, took the colour of the age. Hence the glorious inspiration of\r\nthe Bacchæ and the Atys. Our minds are formed by circumstances: and I do\r\nnot believe that it would be in the power of the greatest modern poet to\r\nlash himself up to a degree of enthusiasm adequate to the production of\r\nsuch works.\r\n\r\nDante alone, among the poets of later times, has been, in this respect,\r\nneither an allegorist nor an imitator; and, consequently, he alone has\r\nintroduced the ancient fictions with effect. His Minos, his Charon,\r\nhis Pluto, are absolutely terrific. Nothing can be more beautiful or\r\noriginal than the use which lie has made of the river of Lethe. He has\r\nnever assigned to his mythological characters any functions inconsistent\r\nwith the creed of the Catholic Church. He has {76}related nothing\r\nconcerning them which a good Christian of that age might not believe\r\npossible. On this account, there is nothing in these passages that\r\nappears puerile or pedantic. On the contrary, this singular use of\r\nclassical names suggests to the mind a vague and awful idea of some\r\nmysterious revelation, anterior to all recorded history, of which the\r\ndispersed fragments might have been retained amidst the impostures and\r\nsuperstitions of later religions. Indeed the mythology of the Divine\r\nComedy is of the elder and more colossal mould. It breathes the spirit\r\nof Homer and Æschylus, not of Ovid and Claudian.\r\n\r\nThis is the more extraordinary, since Dante seems to have been utterly\r\nignorant of the Greek language; and his favorite Latin models could only\r\nhave served to mislead him. Indeed, it is impossible not to remark his\r\nadmiration of writers far inferior to himself; and, in particular,\r\nhis idolatry of Virgil, who, elegant and splendid as he is, has no\r\npretensions to the depth and originality of mind which characterise his\r\nTuscan worshipper. In truth, it may be laid down as an almost universal\r\nrule that good poets are bad critics. Their minds are under the tyranny\r\nof ten thousand associations imperceptible to others. The worst writer\r\nmay easily happen to touch a spring which is connected in their minds\r\nwith a long succession of beautiful images. They are like the gigantic\r\nslaves of Aladdin, gifted with matchless power, but bound by spells\r\nso mighty that when a child whom they could have crushed touched a\r\ntalisman, of whose secret he was ignorant, they immediately became his\r\nvassals. It has more than once happened to me to see minds, graceful\r\nand majestic as the Titania of Shakspeare, bewitched by the charms of\r\nan ass’s head, bestowing on it the fondest {77}caresses, and crowning it\r\nwith the sweetest flowers. I need only mention the poems attributed to\r\nOssian. They are utterly worthless, except as an edifying instance of\r\nthe success of a story without evidence, and of a book without merit.\r\nThey are a chaos of words which present no image, of images which have\r\nno archetype:--they are without form and void; and darkness is upon the\r\nface of them. Yet how many men of genius have panegyrised and imitated\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nThe style of Dante is, if not his highest, perhaps his most peculiar\r\nexcellence. I know nothing with which it can be compared. The noblest\r\nmodels of Greek composition must yield to it. His words are the fewest\r\nand the best which it is possible to use. The first expression in which\r\nhe clothes his thoughts is always so energetic and comprehensive that\r\namplification would only injure the effect. There is probably no writer\r\nin any language who has presented so many strong pictures to the mind.\r\nYet there is probably no writer equally concise. This perfection of\r\nstyle is the principal merit of the Paradiso, which, as I have already\r\nremarked, is by no means equal in other respects to the two preceding\r\nparts of the poem. The force and felicity of the diction, however,\r\nirresistibly attract the reader through the theological lectures and the\r\nsketches of ecclesiastical biography, with which this division of the\r\nwork too much abounds. It may seem almost absurd to quote particular\r\nspecimens of an excellence which is diffused over all his hundred\r\ncantos. I will, however, instance the third canto of the Inferno, and\r\nthe sixth of the Purgatorio, as passages incomparable in their kind. The\r\nmerit of the latter is, perhaps, rather oratorical than poetical; nor\r\ncan I recollect any thing in the great Athenian speeches {78}which\r\nequals it in force of invective and bitterness of sarcasm. I have heard\r\nthe most eloquent statesman of the age remark that, next to Demosthenes,\r\nDante is the writer who ought to be most attentively studied by every\r\nman who desires to attain oratorical eminence.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to close this feeble and rambling critique. I cannot\r\nrefrain, however, from saying a few words upon the translations of the\r\ndivine comedy. Boyd’s is as tedious and languid as the original is rapid\r\nand forcible. The strange measure which he has chosen, and, for ought I\r\nknow, invented, is most unfit for such a work. Translations ought never\r\nto be written in a verse which requires much command of rhyme. The\r\nstanza becomes a bed of Procrustes; and the thoughts of the unfortunate\r\nauthor are alternately racked and curtailed to fit their new receptacle.\r\nThe abrupt and yet consecutive style of Dante suffers more than that\r\nof any other poet by a version diffuse in style, and divided into\r\nparagraphs, for they deserve no other name, of equal length.\r\n\r\nNothing can be said in favour of Hayley’s attempt, but that it is better\r\nthan Boyd’s. His mind was a tolerable specimen of filagree work,--rather\r\nelegant, and very feeble. All that can be said for his best works is\r\nthat they are neat. All that can be said against his worst is that they\r\nare stupid. He might have translated Metastasio tolerably. But he was\r\nutterly unable to do justice to the\r\n\r\n                        “rime e aspre e chioce,\r\n\r\n                   Come si converrebbe al tristo buco.” (1)\r\n\r\nI turn with pleasure from these wretched performances to Mr. Cary’s\r\ntranslation. It is a work which well deserves a separate discussion, and\r\non which, if\r\n\r\n     (1)Inferno, canto xxxii.\r\n\r\n{79}this article were not already too long, I could dwell with great\r\npleasure. At present I will only say that there is no other version in\r\nthe world, as far as I know, so faithful, yet that there is no other\r\nversion which so fully proves that the translator is himself a man of\r\npoetical genius. Those who are ignorant of the Italian language should\r\nread it to become acquainted with the Divine Comedy. Those who are most\r\nintimate with Italian literature should read it for its original merits:\r\nand I believe that they will find it difficult to determine whether the\r\nauthor deserves most praise for his intimacy with the language of Dante,\r\nor for his extraordinary mastery over his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n{80}(_Knight’s Quarterly Magazine,_ April 1824.)\r\n\r\nNo. II. PETRARCH.\r\n\r\n               Et vos, o lauri, carpam, et te, proxima myrte,\r\n\r\n               Sic positæ quoniam suaves miscetis odores. _Virgil_.\r\n\r\nIt would not be easy to name a writer whose celebrity, when both its\r\nextent and its duration are taken into the account, can be considered as\r\nequal to that of Petrarch. Four centuries and a half have elapsed since\r\nhis death. Yet still the inhabitants of every nation throughout the\r\nwestern world are as familiar with his character and his adventures as\r\nwith the most illustrious names, and the most recent anecdotes, of their\r\nown literary history. This is indeed a rare distinction. His detractors\r\nmust acknowledge that it could not have been acquired by a poet\r\ndestitute of merit. His admirers will scarcely maintain that the\r\nunassisted merit of Petrarch could have raised him to that eminence\r\nwhich has not yet been attained by Shakspeare, Milton, or Dante,--that\r\neminence, of which perhaps no modern writer, excepting himself and\r\nCervantes, has long retained possession,--an European reputation.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to discover some of the causes to which this great\r\nman has owed a celebrity, which I {81}cannot but think disproportioned\r\nto his real claims on the admiration of mankind. In the first place, he\r\nis an egotist. Egotism in conversation is universally abhorred. Lovers,\r\nand, I believe, lovers alone, pardon it in each other. No services,\r\nno talents, no powers of pleasing, render it endurable. Gratitude,\r\nadmiration, interest, fear, scarcely prevent those who are condemned to\r\nlisten to it from indicating their disgust and fatigue. The childless\r\nuncle, the powerful patron, can scarcely extort this compliance. We\r\nleave the inside of the mail in a storm, and mount the box, rather than\r\nhear the history of our companion. The chaplain bites his lips in the\r\npresence of the archbishop. The midshipman yawns at the table of\r\nthe First Lord. Yet, from whatever cause, this practice, the pest of\r\nconversation, gives to writing a zest which nothing else can impart.\r\nRousseau made the boldest experiment of this kind; and it fully\r\nsucceeded. In our own time Lord Byron, by a series of attempts of the\r\nsame nature, made himself the object of general interest and admiration.\r\nWordsworth wrote with egotism more intense, but less obvious; and he has\r\nbeen rewarded with a sect of worshippers, comparatively small in number,\r\nbut far more enthusiastic in their devotion. It is needless to multiply\r\ninstances. Even now all the walks of literature are infested with\r\nmendicants for fame, who attempt to excite our interest by exhibiting\r\nall the distortions of their intellects, and stripping the covering from\r\nall the putrid sores of their feelings. Nor are there wanting many who\r\npush their imitation of the beggars whom they resemble a step further,\r\nand who find it easier to extort a pittance from the spectator, by\r\nsimulating deformity and debility from which they are exempt, than\r\nby such {82}honest labour as their health and strength enable them to\r\nperform. In the mean time the credulous public pities and pampers a\r\nnuisance which requires only the tread-mill and the whip. This art,\r\noften successful when employed by dunces, gives irresistible fascination\r\nto works which possess intrinsic merit. We are always desirous to know\r\nsomething of the character and situation of those whose writings we have\r\nperused with pleasure. The passages in which Milton has alluded to\r\nhis own circumstances are perhaps read more frequently, and with more\r\ninterest, than any other lines in his poems. It is amusing to observe\r\nwith what labour critics have attempted to glean from the poems of\r\nHomer some hints as to his situation and feelings. According to one\r\nhypothesis, he intended to describe himself under the name of Demodocus.\r\nOthers maintain that he was the identical Phemius whose life Ulysses\r\nspared. This propensity of the human mind explains, I think, in a great\r\ndegree, the extensive popularity of a poet whose works are little else\r\nthan the expression of his personal feelings.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, Petrarch was not only an egotist, but an amatory\r\negotist. The hopes and fears, the joys and sorrows, which he described,\r\nwere derived from the passion which of all passions exerts the widest\r\ninfluence, and which of all passions borrows most from the imagination.\r\nHe had also another immense advantage. He was the first eminent amatory\r\npoet who appeared after the great convulsion which had changed, not only\r\nthe political, but the moral, state of the world. The Greeks, who, in\r\ntheir public institutions and their literary tastes, were diametrically\r\nopposed to the oriental nations, bore a considerable resemblance to\r\nthose nations in their domestic habits. Like them, they {83}despised the\r\nintellects and immured the persons of their women; and it was among\r\nthe least of the fright-fid evils to which this pernicious system gave\r\nbirth, that all the accomplishments of mind, and all the fascinations of\r\nmanner, which, in a highly-cultivated age, will generally be necessary\r\nto attach men to their female associates, were monopolised by the\r\nPhrynes and the Lamias. The indispensable ingredients of honourable and\r\nchivalrous love were nowhere to be found united. The matrons and their\r\ndaughters, confined in the harem,--insipid, uneducated, ignorant of all\r\nbut the mechanical arts, scarcely seen till they were married,--could\r\nrarely excite interest; while their brilliant rivals, half graces, half\r\nharpies, elegant and informed, but fickle and rapacious, could never\r\ninspire respect.\r\n\r\nThe state of society in Rome was, in this point, far happier; and\r\nthe Latin literature partook of the superiority. The Roman poets have\r\ndecidedly surpassed those of Greece in the delineation of the passion of\r\nlove. There is no subject which they have treated with so much success.\r\nOvid, Catullus, Tibullus, Horace, and Propertius, in spite of all their\r\nfaults, must be allowed to rank high in this department of the art. To\r\nthese I would add my favourite Plautus; who, though he took his plots\r\nfrom Greece, found, I suspect, the originals of his enchanting female\r\ncharacters at Rome.\r\n\r\nStill many evils remained: and, in the decline of the great empire, all\r\nthat was pernicious in its domestic institutions appeared more strongly.\r\nUnder the influence of governments at once dependent and tyrannical,\r\nwhich purchased, by cringing to their enemies, the power of trampling on\r\ntheir subjects, the Romans sunk {84}into the lowest state of effeminacy\r\nand debasement. Falsehood, cowardice, sloth, conscious and unrepining\r\ndegradation, formed the national character. Such a character is totally\r\nincompatible with the stronger passions. Love, in particular, which, in\r\nthe modern sense of the word, implies protection and devotion on the one\r\nside, confidence on the other, respect and fidelity on both, could not\r\nexist among the sluggish and heartless slaves who cringed around the\r\nthrones of Honorius and Augustulus. At this period the great renovation\r\ncommenced. The warriors of the north, destitute as they were of\r\nknowledge and humanity, brought with them, from their forests and\r\nmarshes, those qualities without which humanity is a weakness, and\r\nknowledge a curse,--energy--independence--the dread of shame--the\r\ncontempt of danger. It would be most interesting to examine the manner\r\nin which the admixture of the savage conquerors and the effeminate\r\nslaves, after many generations of darkness and agitation, produced the\r\nmodern European character;--to trace back, from the first conflict to\r\nthe final amalgamation, the operation of that mysterious alchemy, which,\r\nfrom hostile and worthless elements, has extracted the pure gold of\r\nhuman nature--to analyse the mass, and to determine the proportions\r\nin which the ingredients are mingled. But I will confine myself to the\r\nsubject to which I have more particularly referred. The nature of the\r\npassion of love had undergone a complete change. It still retained,\r\nindeed, the fanciful and voluptuous character which it had possessed\r\namong the southern nations of antiquity. But it was tinged with the\r\nsuperstitious veneration with which the northern warriors had been\r\naccustomed to regard women. Devotion and war had {85}imparted to it\r\ntheir most solemn and animating feelings. It was sanctified by\r\nthe blessings of the Church, and decorated with the wreaths of the\r\ntournament. Venus, as in the ancient fable, was again rising above the\r\ndark and tempestuous waves which had so long covered her beauty. But she\r\nrose not now, as of old, in exposed and luxurious loveliness. She still\r\nwore the eestus of her ancient witchcraft; but the diadem of Juno was\r\non her brow, and the ægis of Pallas in her hand. Love might, in fact, be\r\ncalled a new passion; and it is not astonishing that the first poet of\r\neminence who wholly devoted his genius to this theme should have excited\r\nan extraordinary sensation. He may be compared to an adventurer who\r\naccidentally lands in a rich and unknown island; and who, though he may\r\nonly set up an ill-shaped cross upon the shore, acquires possession of\r\nits treasures, and gives it his name. The claim of Petrarch was indeed\r\nsomewhat like that of Amerigo Vespucci to the continent which should\r\nhave derived its appellation from Columbus. The Provençal poets were\r\nunquestionably the masters of the Florentine. But they wrote in an age\r\nwhich could not appreciate their merits; and their imitator lived at the\r\nvery period when composition in the vernacular language began to attract\r\ngeneral attention. Petrarch was in literature what a Valentine is\r\nin love. The public preferred him, not because his merits were of a\r\ntranscendent order, but because he was the first person whom they saw\r\nafter they awoke from their long sleep.\r\n\r\nNor did Petrarch gain less by comparison with his immediate successors\r\nthan with those who had preceded him. Till more than a century after his\r\ndeath Italy produced no poet who could be compared to him. This decay\r\nof genius is doubtless to be ascribed, in a {86}great measure, to the\r\ninfluence which his own works had exercised upon the literature of\r\nhis country. Yet it has conduced much to his fame. Nothing is more\r\nfavourable to the reputation of a writer than to be succeeded by a race\r\ninferior to himself; and it is an advantage, from obvious causes, much\r\nmore frequently enjoyed by those who corrupt the national taste than by\r\nthose who improve it.\r\n\r\nAnother cause has co-operated with those which I have mentioned to\r\nspread the renown of Petrarch. I mean the interest which is inspired by\r\nthe events of his life--an interest which must have been strongly felt\r\nby his contemporaries, since, after an interval of five hundred years,\r\nno critic can be wholly exempt from its influence. Among the great men\r\nto whom we owe the resuscitation of science he deserves the foremost\r\nplace; and his enthusiastic attachment to this great cause constitutes\r\nhis most just and splendid title to the gratitude of posterity. He was\r\nthe votary of literature. He loved it with a perfect love. He worshipped\r\nit with an almost fanatical devotion. He was the missionary, who\r\nproclaimed its discoveries to distant countries--the pilgrim, who\r\ntravelled far and wide to collect its reliques--the hermit, who retired\r\nto seclusion to meditate on its beauties--the champion, who fought its\r\nbattles--the conqueror, who, in more than a metaphorical sense, led\r\nbarbarism and ignorance in triumph, and received in the capitol the\r\nlaurel which his magnificent victory had earned.\r\n\r\nNothing can be conceived more noble or affecting than that ceremony. The\r\nsuperb palaces and porticoes, by which had rolled the ivory chariots\r\nof Marius and Cæsar, had long mouldered into dust. The laurelled\r\nfasces--the golden eagles--the shouting legions--{87}the captives and\r\nthe pictured cities--were indeed wanting to his victorious procession.\r\nThe sceptre had passed away from Rome. But she still retained the\r\nmightier influence of an intellectual empire, and was now to confer the\r\nprouder reward of an intellectual triumph. To the man who had extended\r\nthe dominion of her ancient language--who had erected the trophies\r\nof philosophy and imagination in the haunts of ignorance and\r\nferocity--whose captives were the hearts of admiring nations enchained\r\nby the influence of his song--whose spoils were the treasures of ancient\r\ngenius rescued from obscurity and decay--the Eternal City offered the\r\njust and glorious tribute of her gratitude. Amidst the ruined monuments\r\nof ancient and the infant erections of modern art, he who had restored\r\nthe broken link between the two ages of human civilization was crowned\r\nwith the wreath which he had deserved from the moderns who owed to him\r\ntheir refinement--from the ancients who owed to him their fame. Never\r\nwas a coronation so august witnessed by Westminster or by Rheims.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from this glorious spectacle to the private chamber of the\r\npoet,--when we contemplate the struggle of passion and virtue,--the\r\neye dimmed, the cheek furrowed, by the tears of sinful and hopeless\r\ndesire,--when we reflect on the whole history of his attachment, from\r\nthe gay fantasy of his youth to the lingering despair of his age, pity\r\nand affection mingle with our admiration. Even after death had placed\r\nthe last seal on his misery, we see him devoting to the cause of the\r\nhuman mind all the strength and energy which love and sorrow had spared.\r\nHe lived the apostle of literature;--he fell its martyr:--he was found\r\ndead with his head reclined on a book. {88}Those who have studied the\r\nlife and writings of Petrarch with attention, will perhaps be inclined\r\nto make some deductions from this panegyric. It cannot be denied that\r\nhis merits were disfigured by a most unpleasant affectation. His zeal\r\nfor literature communicated a tinge of pedantry to all his feelings and\r\nopinions. His love was the love of a sonnetteer:--his patriotism was the\r\npatriotism of an antiquarian. The interest with which we contemplate\r\nthe works, and study the history, of those who, in former ages, have\r\noccupied our country, arises from the associations which connect\r\nthem with the community in which are comprised all the objects of our\r\naffection and our hope. In the mind of Petrarch these feelings were\r\nreversed. He loved Italy, because it abounded with the monuments of the\r\nancient masters of the world. His native city--the fair and glorious\r\nFlorence--the modern Athens, then in all the bloom and strength of its\r\nyouth, could not obtain, from the most distinguished of its citizens,\r\nany portion of that passionate homage which he paid to the decrepitude\r\nof Rome. These and many other blemishes, though they must in candour be\r\nacknowledged, can but in a very slight degree diminish the glory of\r\nhis career. For my own part, I look upon it with so much fondness and\r\npleasure that I feel reluctant to turn from it to the consideration of\r\nhis works, which I by no means contemplate with equal admiration.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I think highly of the poetical powers of Petrarch. He did\r\nnot possess, indeed, the art of strongly presenting sensible objects to\r\nthe imagination;--and this is the more remarkable, because the talent of\r\nwhich I speak is that which peculiarly distinguishes the Italian poets.\r\nIn the Divine Comedy it is displayed {89}in its highest perfection. It\r\ncharacterises almost every celebrated poem in the language. Perhaps this\r\nis to be attributed to the circumstance, that painting and sculpture\r\nhad attained a high degree of excellence in Italy before poetry had been\r\nextensively cultivated. Men were debarred from books, but accustomed\r\nfrom childhood to contemplate the admirable works of art, which, even in\r\nthe thirteenth century, Italy began to produce. Hence their imaginations\r\nreceived so strong a bias that, even in their writings, a taste for\r\ngraphic delineation is discernible. The progress of things in England\r\nhas been in all respects different. The consequence is, that English\r\nhistorical pictures are poems on canvass; while Italian poems are\r\npictures painted to the mind by means of words. Of this national\r\ncharacteristic the writings of Petrarch are almost totally destitute.\r\nHis sonnets indeed, from their subject and nature, and his Latin poems,\r\nfrom the restraints which always shackle one who writes in a dead\r\nlanguage, cannot fairly be received in evidence. But his Triumphs\r\nabsolutely required the exercise of this talent, and exhibit no\r\nindications of it.\r\n\r\nGenius, however, he certainly possessed, and genius of a high order. His\r\nardent, tender, and magnificent turn of thought, his brilliant fancy,\r\nhis command of expression, at once forcible and elegant, must be\r\nacknowledged. Nature meant him for the prince of lyric writers. But by\r\none fatal present she deprived her other gifts of half their value. He\r\nwould have been a much greater poet had he been a less clever man. His\r\ningenuity was the bane of his mind. He abandoned the noble and natural\r\nstyle, in which he might have excelled, for the conceits which he\r\nproduced with a facility at once admirable and disgusting. His muse\r\n{90}like the Roman lady in Livy, was tempted by gaudy ornaments to\r\nbetray the fastnesses of her strength, and, like her, was crushed\r\nbeneath the glittering bribes which had seduced her.\r\n\r\nThe paucity of his thoughts is very remarkable. It is impossible to look\r\nwithout amazement on a mind so fertile in combinations, yet so barren\r\nof images. His amatory poetry is wholly made up of a very few topics,\r\ndisposed in so many orders, and exhibited in so many lights, that it\r\nreminds us of those arithmetical problems about permutations, which so\r\nmuch astonish the unlearned. The French cook, who boasted that he could\r\nmake fifteen different dishes out of a nettle-top, was not a greater\r\nmaster of his art. The mind of Petrarch was a kaleidoscope. At every\r\nturn it presents us with new forms, always fantastic, occasionally\r\nbeautiful; and we can scarcely believe that all these varieties have\r\nbeen produced by the same worthless fragments of glass. The sameness of\r\nhis images is, indeed, in some degree, to be attributed to the sameness\r\nof his subject. It would be unreasonable to expect perpetual variety\r\nfrom so many hundred compositions, all of the same length, all in\r\nthe same measure, and all addressed to the same insipid and heartless\r\ncoquette. I cannot but suspect also that the perverted taste, which is\r\nthe blemish of his amatory verses, was to be attributed to the influence\r\nof Laura, who probably, like most critics of her sex, preferred a gaudy\r\nto a majestic style. Be this as it may, he no sooner changes his subject\r\nthan he changes his manner. When he speaks of the wrongs and degradation\r\nof Italy, devastated by foreign invaders, and but feebly defended by\r\nher pusillanimous children, the effeminate lisp of the sonnetteer is\r\nexchanged for a cry, wild, and solemn, and piercing as {91}that which\r\nproclaimed “Sleep no more” to the bloody house of Cawdor. “Italy seems\r\nnot to feel her sufferings,” exclaims her impassioned poet; “decrepit,\r\nsluggish, and languid, will she sleep for ever? Will there be none to\r\nawake her? Oh that I had my hands twisted in her hair!” (1)\r\n\r\nNor is it with less energy that he denounces against the Mahometan\r\nBabylon the vengeance of Europe and of Christ. His magnificent\r\nenumeration of the ancient exploits of the Greeks must always excite\r\nadmiration, and cannot be perused without the deepest interest, at a\r\ntime when the wise and good, bitterly disappointed in so many other\r\ncountries, are looking with breathless anxiety towards the natal land of\r\nliberty,--the field of Marathon,--and the deadly pass where the Lion of\r\nLacedæmon turned to bay. (2)\r\n\r\nHis poems on religious subjects also deserve the highest commendation.\r\nAt the head of these must be placed the Ode to the Virgin. It is,\r\nperhaps, the finest hymn in the world. His devout veneration receives an\r\nexquisitely poetical character from the delicate perception of the sex\r\nand the loveliness of his idol, which we may easily trace throughout the\r\nwhole composition.\r\n\r\nI could dwell with pleasure on these and similar parts of the writings\r\nof Petrarch; but I must return to his amatory poetry: to that he\r\nentrusted his fame; and to that he has principally owed it.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing defect of his best compositions on this subject is the\r\nuniversal brilliancy with which they\r\n\r\n(1)                    Clie suoi guai non par che senta;\r\n\r\n                   Vecchia, oziosa, e lenta.\r\n\r\n                   Dormira sempre, e non fia chi la svegli?\r\n\r\n                   Le man l’avess’ io avvolte entro e capegli.--Canzone xi.\r\n\r\n(2)\r\n\r\n                   Maratona, e le mortali strette\r\n\r\n                   Che difese il Leon con poca gente.--Canzone v.\r\n\r\n{92}are lighted up. The natural language of the passions is, indeed,\r\noften figurative and fantastic; and with none is this more the case than\r\nwith that of love. Still there is a limit. The feelings should, indeed,\r\nhave their ornamental garb; but, like an elegant woman, they should be\r\nneither muffled nor exposed. The drapery should be so arranged, as at\r\nonce to answer the purposes of modest concealment and judicious display.\r\nThe decorations should sometimes be employed to hide a defect, and\r\nsometimes to heighten a beauty; but never to conceal, much less to\r\ndistort, the charms to which they are subsidiary. The love of Petrarch,\r\non the contrary, arrays itself like a foppish savage, whose nose is\r\nbored with a golden ring, whose skin is painted with grotesque forms\r\nand dazzling colours, and whose ears are drawn down his shoulders by the\r\nweight of jewels. It is a rule, without any exception, in all kinds of\r\ncomposition, that the principal idea, the predominant feeling, should\r\nnever be confounded with the accompanying decorations. It should\r\ngenerally be distinguished from them by greater simplicity of\r\nexpression; as we recognise Napoleon in the pictures of his battles,\r\namidst a crowd of embroidered coats and plumes, by his grey cloak and\r\nhis hat without a feather. In the verses of Petrarch it is generally\r\nimpossible to say what thought is meant to be prominent. All is equally\r\nelaborate. The chief wears the same gorgeous and degrading livery with\r\nhis retinue, and obtains only his share of the indifferent stare which\r\nwe bestow upon them in common. The poems have no strong lights and\r\nshades, no background, no foreground;--they are like the illuminated\r\nfigures in an oriental manuscript,--plenty of rich tints and no\r\nperspective. Such are the fruits of the most celebrated of these\r\ncompositions. {93}Of those which are universally acknowledged to be bad\r\nit is scarcely possible to speak with patience. Yet they have much\r\nin common with their splendid companions. They differ from them, as a\r\nMay-day procession of chimney-sweepers differs from the Field of Cloth\r\nof Gold. They have the gaudiness but not the wealth. His muse belongs to\r\nthat numerous class of females who have no objection to be dirty,\r\nwhile they can be tawdry. When his brilliant conceits are exhausted, he\r\nsupplies their place with metaphysical quibbles, forced antitheses, bad\r\npuns, and execrable charades. In his fifth sonnet he may, I think, be\r\nsaid to have sounded the lowest chasm of the Bathos. Upon the whole,\r\nthat piece may be safely pronounced to be the worst attempt at poetry,\r\nand the worst attempt at wit, in the world.\r\n\r\nA strong proof of the truth of these criticisms is, that almost all the\r\nsonnets produce exactly the same effect on the mind of the reader. They\r\nrelate to all the various moods of a lover, from joy to despair:--yet\r\nthey are perused, as far as my experience and observation have gone,\r\nwith exactly the same feeling. The fact is, that in none of them are the\r\npassion and the ingenuity mixed in just proportions. There is not enough\r\nsentiment to dilute the condiments which are employed to season it. The\r\nrepast which he sets before us resembles the Spanish entertainment in\r\nDry-den’s _Mock Astrologer_, at which the relish of all the dishes\r\nand sauces was overpowered by the common flavour of spice.\r\nFish,--flesh,--fowl,--everything at table tasted of nothing but red\r\npepper.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Petrarch may indeed suffer undeservedly from one cause\r\nto which I must allude. His imitators have so much familiarised the ear\r\nof Italy {94}and of Europe to the favourite topics of amorous flattery\r\nand lamentation, that we can scarcely think them original when we\r\nfind them in the first author; and, even when our understandings have\r\nconvinced us that they were new to him, they are still old to us. This\r\nhas been the fate of many of the finest passages of the most eminent\r\nwriters. It is melancholy to trace a noble thought from stage to stage\r\nof its profanation; to see it transferred from the first illustrious\r\nwearer to his lacqueys, turned, and turned again, and at last hung on a\r\nscare-crow. Petrarch has really suffered much from this cause. Yet that\r\nhe should have so suffered is a sufficient proof that his excellences\r\nwere not of the highest order. A line may be stolen; but the pervading\r\nspirit of a great poet is not to be sureptitiously obtained by a\r\nplagiarist. The continued imitation of twenty-five centuries has left\r\nHomer as it found him. If every simile and every turn of Dante had been\r\ncopied ten thousand times, the Divine Comedy would have retained all\r\nits freshness. It was easy for the porter in Farquhar to pass for Beau\r\nClincher, by borrowing his lace and his pulvilio. It would have been\r\nmore difficult to enact Sir Harry Wildair.\r\n\r\nBefore I quit this subject I must defend Petrarch from one accusation,\r\nwhich is in the present day frequently brought against him. His sonnets\r\nare pronounced by a large sect of critics not to possess certain\r\nqualities which they maintain to be indispensable to sonnets, with as\r\nmuch confidence, and as much reason, as their prototypes of old insisted\r\non the unities of the drama. I am an exoteric--utterly unable to explain\r\nthe mysteries of this new poetical faith. I only know that it is a\r\nfaith, which except a man do keep pure and undefiled, without doubt he\r\nshall be called a {95}blockhead. I cannot, however, refrain from asking\r\nwhat is the particular virtue which belongs to fourteen as distinguished\r\nfrom all other numbers. Does it arise from its being a multiple of\r\nseven? Has this principle any reference to the sabbatical ordinance?\r\nOr is it to the order of rhymes that these singular properties are\r\nattached? Unhappily the sonnets of Shakspeare differ as much in this\r\nrespect from those of Petrarch, as from a Spenserian or an octave\r\nstanza. Away with this unmeaning jargon! We have pulled down the old\r\nregime of criticism. I trust that we shall never tolerate the equally\r\npedantic and irrational despotism, which some of the revolutionary\r\nleaders would erect upon its ruins. We have not dethroned Aristotle and\r\nBossu for this.\r\n\r\nThese sonnet-fanciers would do well to reflect that, though the style of\r\nPetrarch may not suit the standard of perfection which they have chosen,\r\nthey lie under great obligations to these very poems,--that, but for\r\nPetrarch, the measure, concerning which they legislate so judiciously,\r\nwould probably never have attracted notice;--and that to him they owe\r\nthe pleasure of admiring, and the glory of composing, pieces, which seem\r\nto have been produced by Master Slender, with the assistance of his man\r\nSimple.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude these remarks without making a few observations on the\r\nLatin writings of Petrarch. It appears that, both by himself and by his\r\ncontemporaries, these were far more highly valued than his compositions\r\nin the vernacular language. Posterity, the supreme court of literary\r\nappeal, has not only reversed the judgment, but, according to its\r\ngeneral practice, reversed it with costs, and condemned the unfortunate\r\nworks to pay, not only for their own inferiority, but {96}also for the\r\ninjustice of those who had given them an unmerited preference. And\r\nit must be owned that, without making large allowances for the\r\ncircumstances under which they were produced, we cannot pronounce a very\r\nfavourable judgment. They must be considered as exotics, transplanted to\r\na foreign climate, and reared in an unfavourable situation; and it would\r\nbe unreasonable to expect from them the health and the vigour which\r\nwe find in the indigenous plants around them, or which they might\r\nthemselves have possessed in their native soil. He has but very\r\nimperfectly imitated the style of the Latin authors, and has not\r\ncompensated for the deficiency by enriching the ancient language with\r\nthe graces of modern poetry. The splendour and ingenuity, which we\r\nadmire, even when we condemn it, in his Italian works, is almost totally\r\nwanting, and only illuminates with rare and occasional glimpses the\r\ndreary obscurity of the Africa. The eclogues have more animation; but\r\nthey can only be called poems by courtesy. They have nothing in common\r\nwith his writings in his native language, except the eternal pun about\r\nLaura and Daphne. None of these works would have placed him on a level\r\nwith Vida or Buchanan. Yet, when we compare him with those who preceded\r\nhim, when we consider that he went on the forlorn hope of literature,\r\nthat he was the first who perceived, and the first who attempted to\r\nrevive, the finer elegancies of the ancient language of the world, we\r\nshall perhaps think more highly of him than of those who could never\r\nhave surpassed his beauties if they had not inherited them.\r\n\r\nHe has aspired to emulate the philosophical eloquence of Cicero, as well\r\nas the poetical majesty of {97}Virgil. His essay on the Remedies of Good\r\nand Evil Fortune is a singular work, in a colloquial form, and a most\r\nscholastic style. It seems to be framed upon the model of the Tusculan\r\nQuestions,--with what success those who have read it may easily\r\ndetermine. It consists of a series of dialogues: in each of these a\r\nperson is introduced who has experienced some happy or some adverse\r\nevent: he gravely states his case; and a reasoner, or rather Reason\r\npersonified, confutes him; a task not very difficult, since the disciple\r\ndefends his position only by pertinaciously repeating it, in almost\r\nthe same words, at the end of every argument of his antagonist. In this\r\nmanner Petrarch solves an immense variety of cases. Indeed, I doubt\r\nwhether it would be possible to name any pleasure or any calamity which\r\ndoes not find a place in this dissertation. He gives excellent advice to\r\na man who is in expectation of discovering the philosopher’s stone;--to\r\nanother, who has formed a fine aviary;--to a third, who is delighted\r\nwith the tricks of a favourite monkey. His lectures to the unfortunate\r\nare equally singular. He seems to imagine that a precedent in point is a\r\nsufficient consolation for every form of suffering. “Our town is taken,”\r\n says one complainant;” “So was Troy,” replies his comforter. “My wife\r\nhas eloped,” says another; “If it has happened to you once, it happened\r\nto Menelaus twice.” One poor fellow is in great distress at having\r\ndiscovered that his wife’s son is none of his. “It is hard,” says he,\r\n“that I should have had the expense of bringing up one who is\r\nindifferent to me.”\r\n\r\n“You are a man,” returns his monitor, quoting the famous line of\r\nTerence; “and nothing that belongs to any other man ought to be\r\nindifferent to you.” The physical calamities of life are not omitted;\r\n{98}and there is in particular a disquisition on the advantages of\r\nhaving the itch, which, if not convincing, is certainly very amusing.\r\n\r\nThe invectives on an unfortunate physician, or rather upon the medical\r\nscience, have more spirit. Petrarch was thoroughly in earnest on this\r\nsubject. And the bitterness of his feelings occasionally produces, in\r\nthe midst of his classical and scholastic pedantry, a sentence worthy of\r\nthe second Philippic. Swift himself might have envied the chapter on the\r\ncauses of the paleness of physicians.\r\n\r\nOf his Latin works the Epistles are the most generally known and\r\nadmired. As compositions they are certainly superior to his essays.\r\nBut their excellence is only comparative. From so large a collection of\r\nletters, written by so eminent a man, during so varied and eventful\r\na life, we should have expected a complete and spirited view of the\r\nliterature, the manners, and the politics of the age. A traveller--a\r\npoet--a scholar--a lover--a courtier--a recluse--he might have\r\nperpetuated, in an imperishable record, the form and pressure of the age\r\nand body of the time. Those who read his correspondence, in the hope\r\nof finding such information as this, will be utterly disappointed. It\r\ncontains nothing characteristic of the period or of the individual. It\r\nis a series, not of letters, but of themes; and, as it is not generally\r\nknown, might be very safely employed at public schools as a magazine of\r\ncommon-places. Whether he write on politics to the Emperor and the\r\nDoge, or send advice and consolation to a private friend, every line is\r\ncrowded with examples and quotations, and sounds big with Anaxagoras and\r\nScipio. Such was the interest excited by the character of Petrarch, and\r\nsuch the admiration {99}which was felt for his epistolary style, that\r\nit was with difficulty that his letters reached the place of their\r\ndestination. The poet describes, with pretended regret and real\r\ncomplacency, the importunity of the curious, who often opened, and\r\nsometimes stole, these favourite compositions. It is a remarkable\r\nfact that, of all his epistles, the least affected are those which are\r\naddressed to the dead and the unborn. Nothing can be more absurd than\r\nhis whim of composing grave letters of expostulation and commendation to\r\nCicero and Seneca; yet these strange performances are written in a\r\nfar more natural manner than his communications to his living\r\ncorrespondents. But of all his Latin works the preference must be given\r\nto the Epistle to Posterity; a simple, noble, and pathetic composition,\r\nmost honourable both to his taste and his heart. If we can make\r\nallowance for some of the affected humility of an author, we shall\r\nperhaps think that no literary man has left a more pleasing memorial of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we may pronounce that the works of Petrarch were below\r\nboth his genius and his celebrity; and that the circumstances under\r\nwhich he wrote were as adverse to the development of his powers as they\r\nwere favourable to the extension of his fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT LAWSUIT BETWEEN THE PARISHES OF ST. DENNIS AND\r\nST. GEORGE IN THE WATER.\r\n\r\n{100}(_Knight’s Quarterly Magazine_, April 1824.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Dennis is one of the most pleasant parts of the\r\ncountry in which it is situated. It is fertile, well wooded, well\r\nwatered, and of an excellent air. For many generations the manor had\r\nbeen holden in tail-male by a worshipful family, who have always taken\r\nprecedence of their neighbor’s at the races and the sessions.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the affairs of this parish were administered by a\r\nCourt-Baron, in which the freeholders were judges; and the rates were\r\nlevied by select vestries of the inhabitant householders. But at length\r\nthese good customs fell into disuse. The Lords of the Manor, indeed,\r\nstill held courts for form’s sake; but they or their stewards had the\r\nwhole management of affairs. They demanded services, duties, and customs\r\nto which they had no just title. Nay, they would often bring actions\r\nagainst their neighbours for their own private advantage, and then send\r\nin the bill to the parish. No objection was made, during many years, to\r\nthese proceedings, so that the rates became heavier {101}and heavier:\r\nnor was any person exempted from these demands, except the footmen and\r\ngamekeepers of the squire and the rector of the parish. They indeed were\r\nnever checked in any excess. They would come to an honest labourer’s\r\ncottage, eat his pancakes, tuck his fowls into their pockets, and cane\r\nthe poor man himself. If he went up to the great house to complain, it\r\nwas hard to get the speech of Sir Lewis; and, indeed, his only chance of\r\nbeing righted was to coax the squire’s pretty housekeeper, who could do\r\nwhat she pleased with her master. If he ventured to intrude upon the\r\nLord of the Manor without this precaution, he gained nothing by his\r\npains. Sir Lewis, indeed, would at first receive him with a civil face;\r\nfor, to give him his due, he could be a fine gentleman when he pleased.\r\n“Good day, my friend,” he would say “what situation have you in my\r\nfamily?”\r\n\r\n“Bless your honour!” says the poor fellow, “I am not one of your\r\nhonour’s servants; I rent a small piece of ground, your honour.”\r\n\r\n“Then, you dog,” quoth the squire, “what do you mean by coming here? Has\r\na gentleman nothing to do but to hear the complaints of clowns? Here!\r\nPhilip, James, Dick, toss this fellow in a blanket; or duck him, and set\r\nhim in the stocks to dry.”\r\n\r\nOne of these precious Lords of the Manor enclosed a deer-park; and, in\r\norder to stock it, he seized all the pretty pet fawns that his tenants\r\nhad brought up, without paying them a farthing, or asking their leave.\r\nIt was a sad day for the parish of St. Dennis. Indeed, I do not believe\r\nthat all his oppressive exactions and long bills enraged the poor\r\ntenants so much as this cruel measure.\r\n\r\nYet for a long time, in spite of all these inconveniences, {102}St.\r\nDennis’s was a very pleasant place. The people could not refrain from\r\ncapering if they heard the sound of a fiddle. And, if they were inclined\r\nto be riotous, Sir Lewis had only to send for Punch, or the dancing\r\ndogs, and all was quiet again. But this could not last for ever; they\r\nbegan to think more and more of their condition; and, at last, a club of\r\nfoulmouthed, good-for-nothing rascals was held at the sign of the Devil,\r\nfor the purpose of abusing the squire and the parson. The doctor, to own\r\nthe truth, was old and indolent, extremely fat and greedy. He had not\r\npreached a tolerable sermon for a long time. The squire was still worse:\r\nso that, partly by truth and partly by falsehood, the club set the whole\r\nparish against their superiors. The boys scrawled caricatures of the\r\nclergyman upon the church-door, and shot at the landlord with pop-guns\r\nas he rode a hunting. It was even whispered about that the Lord of the\r\nManor had no right to his estate, and that, if he were compelled to\r\nproduce the original title-deeds, it would be found that he only held\r\nthe estate in trust for the inhabitants of the parish.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the squire was pressed more and more for money. The\r\nparish could pay no more. The rector refused to lend a farthing. The\r\nJews were clamorous for their money; and the landlord had no other\r\nresource than to call together the inhabitants of the parish, and to\r\nrequest their assistance. They now attacked him furiously about their\r\ngrievances, and insisted that he should relinquish his oppressive\r\npowers. They insisted that his footmen should be kept in order, that\r\nthe parson should pay his share of the rates, that the children of the\r\nparish should be allowed to fish in the trout-stream, and to gather\r\nblackberries in the {103}hedges. They at last went so far as to demand\r\nthat he should acknowledge that he held his estate only in trust for\r\nthem. His distress compelled him to submit. They, in return, agreed\r\nto set him free from his pecuniary difficulties, and to suffer him\r\nto inhabit the manor-house; and only annoyed him from time to time by\r\nsinging impudent ballads under his window.\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring gentlefolks did not look on these proceedings with much\r\ncomplacency. It is true that Sir Lewis and his ancestors had plagued\r\nthem with law-suits, and affronted them at county-meetings. Still they\r\npreferred the insolence of a gentleman to that of the rabble, and felt\r\nsome uneasiness lest the example should infect their own tenants.\r\n\r\nA large party of them met at the house of Lord Cæsar Germain. Lord Cæsar\r\nwas the proudest man in the country. His family was very ancient and\r\nillustrius ones, though not particularly opulent. He had invited most of\r\nhis wealthy neighbours. There was Mrs. Kitty North, the relict of poor\r\nSquire Peter, respecting whom the coroner’s jury had found a verdict\r\nof accidental death, but whose fate had nevertheless excited strange\r\nwhispers in the neighbourhood. There was Squire Don, the owner of the\r\ngreat West Indian property, who was not so rich as he had formerly been,\r\nbut still retained his pride, and kept up his customary pomp; so that he\r\nhad plenty of plate but no breeches. There was Squire Von Blunderbussen,\r\nwho had succeeded to the estates of his uncle, old Colonel Frederic\r\nVon Blunderbussen, of the hussar’s. The colonel was a very singular old\r\nfellow; he used to learn a page of Chambaud’s grammar, and to translate\r\nTelemaque, every morning, and he kept six French masters to teach him to\r\nparleyvoo. Nevertheless, he was a {104}shrewd clever man, and improved\r\nhis estate with so much care, sometimes by honest and sometimes by\r\ndishonest means, that he left a very pretty property to his nephew.\r\n\r\nLord Cæsar poured out a glass of Tokay for Mrs. Kitty. “Your health, my\r\ndear madam, I never saw you look more charming. Pray, what think you of\r\nthese doings at St. Dennis’s?”\r\n\r\n“Fine doings! indeed!” interrupted Von Blunderbussen;\r\n\r\n“I wish that we had my old uncle alive, he would have had some of them\r\nup to the halberts. He knew how to use a cat-o’-nine-tails. If things\r\ngo on in this way, a gentleman will not be able to horsewhip an impudent\r\nfarmer, or to say a civil word to a milkmaid.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, it’s very true, Sir,” said Mrs. Kitty; “their insolence is\r\nintolerable. Look at me, for instance:--a poor lone woman!--My dear\r\nPeter dead! I loved him:--so I did; and, when he died, I was so\r\nhysterical you cannot think. And now I cannot lean on the arm of a\r\ndecent footman, or take a walk with a tall grenadier behind me, just to\r\nprotect me from audacious vagabonds, but they must have their nauseous\r\nsuspicions;--odious creatures!”--\r\n\r\n“This must be stopped,” replied Lord Cæsar. “We ought to contribute to\r\nsupport my poor brother-in-law against these rascals. I will write to\r\nSquire Guelf on this subject by this night’s post. His name is always at\r\nthe head of our county subscriptions.”\r\n\r\nIf the people of St. Dennis’s had been angry before, they were well nigh\r\nmad when they heard of this conversation. The whole parish ran to the\r\nmanor-house. Sir Lewis’s Swiss porter shut the door against them; but\r\nthey broke in and knocked him on the head for his {105}impudence. They\r\nthen seized the squire, hooted at him, pelted him, ducked him, and\r\ncarried him to the watch-house. They turned the rector into the street,\r\nburnt his wig and band, and sold the church-plate by auction. They put\r\nup a painted Jezebel in the pulpit to preach. They scratched out the\r\ntexts which were written round the church, and scribbled profane\r\nscraps of songs and plays in their place. They set the organ playing\r\nto pot-house tune. Instead of being decently asked in church, they were\r\nmarried over a broomstick. But, of all their whims, the use of the new\r\npatent steel-traps was the most remarkable.\r\n\r\nThis trap was constructed on a completely new principle. It consisted\r\nof a cleaver hung in a frame like a window; when any poor wretch got\r\nin, down it came with a tremendous din, and took off his head in a\r\ntwinkling. They got the squire into one of these machines. In order to\r\nprevent any of his partisans from getting footing in the parish, they\r\nplaced traps at every corner. It was impossible to walk through the\r\nhighway at broad noon without tumbling into one or other of them. No\r\nman could go about his business in security. Yet so great was the hatred\r\nwhich the inhabitants entertained for the old family, that a few decent\r\nhonest people, who begged them to take down the steel-traps, and to put\r\nup humane man-traps in their room, were very roughly handled for their\r\ngood nature.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the neighbouring gentry undertook a suit against the\r\nparish on the behalf of Sir Lewis’s heir, and applied to Squire Guelf\r\nfor his assistance.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that Squire Guelf is more closely tied up than any\r\ngentleman in the shire. He could, therefore, lend them no help; but\r\nhe referred them to {106}the Vestry of the Parish of St. George in\r\nthe Water. These good people had long borne a grudge against their\r\nneighbours on the other side of the stream; and some mutual trespasses\r\nhad lately occurred which increased their hostility.\r\n\r\nThere was an honest Irishman, a great favourite among them, who used to\r\nentertain them with raree-shows, and to exhibit a magic lantern to the\r\nchildren on winter evenings. He had gone quite mad upon this subject.\r\nSometimes he would call out in the middle of the street--“Take care\r\nof that corner, neighbours; for the love of Heaven, keep clear of that\r\npost, there is a patent steel-trap concealed thereabouts.” Sometimes he\r\nwould be disturbed by frightful dreams; then he would get up at dead of\r\nnight, open his window and cry “fire,” till the parish was roused, and\r\nthe engines sent for. The pulpit of the Parish of St. George seemed\r\nlikely to fall; I believe that the only reason was that the parson had\r\ngrown too fat and heavy; but nothing would persuade this honest man but\r\nthat it was a scheme of the people at St. Dennis’s, and that they had\r\nsawed through the pillars in order to break the rector’s neck. Once he\r\nwent about with a knife in his pocket, and told all the persons whom he\r\nmet that it had been sharpened by the knife-grinder of the next parish\r\nto cut their throats. These extravagancies had a great effect on the\r\npeople; and the more so because they were espoused by Squire Guelf’s\r\nsteward, who was the most influential person in the parish. He was a\r\nvery fair-spoken man, very attentive to the main chance, and the idol of\r\nthe old women, because he never played at skittles or danced with the\r\ngirls; and, indeed, never took any recreation but that of drinking\r\non Saturday nights with his friend Harry, the Scotch {107}pedlar. His\r\nsupporters called him Sweet William; his enemies the Bottomless Pit.\r\n\r\nThe people of St. Dennis’s, however, had their advocates. There was\r\nFrank, the richest farmer in the parish, whose great grandfather had\r\nbeen knocked oil the head many years before, in a squabble between the\r\nparish and a former landlord. There was Dick, the merry-andrew, rather\r\nlight-fingered and riotous, but a clever droll fellow. Above all, there\r\nwas Charley, the publican, a jolly, fat, honest lad, a great favourite\r\nwith the women, who, if he had not been rather too fond of ale and\r\nchuck-farthing, would have been the best fellow in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n“My boys,” said Charley, “this is exceedingly well for Madam North;--not\r\nthat I would speak uncivilly of her; she put up my picture in her best\r\nroom, bless her for it! But, I say, this is very well for her, and for\r\nLord Cæsar, and Squire Don, and Colonel Von;--but what affair is it of\r\nyours or mine? It is not to be wondered at, that gentlemen should wish\r\nto keep poor people out of their own. But it is strange, indeed, that\r\nthey should expect the poor themselves to combine against their own\r\ninterests. If the folks at St. Dennis’s should attack us we have the law\r\nand our cudgels to protect us. But why, in the name of wonder, are we to\r\nattack them? When old Sir Charles, who was Lord of the Manor formerly,\r\nand the parson, who was presented by him to the living, tried to bully\r\nthe vestry, did not we knock their heads together, and go to meeting to\r\nhear Jeremiah Ringletub preach? And did the Squire Don, or the great Sir\r\nLewis, that lived at that time, or the Germains, say a word against us\r\nfor it? Mind your own business, my lads: law is not to {108}be had for\r\nnothing; and we, you may be sure, shall have to pay the whole bill.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless the people of St. George’s were resolved on law. They cried\r\nout most lustily, “Squire Guelf for ever! Sweet William for ever! No\r\nsteel traps!” Squire Guelf took all the rascally footmen who had worn\r\nold Sir Lewis’s livery into his service. They were fed in the kitchen\r\non the very best of every thing, though they had no settlement. Many\r\npeople, and the paupers in particular, grumbled at these proceedings.\r\nThe steward, however, devised a way to keep them quiet.\r\n\r\nThere had lived in this parish for many years an old gentleman, named\r\nSir Habeas Corpus. He was said by some to be of Saxon, by some of\r\nNorman, extraction. Some maintained that he was not born till after\r\nthe time of Sir Charles, to whom we have before alluded. Others are of\r\nopinion that he was a legitimate son of old Lady Magna Charta, although\r\nhe was long concealed and kept out of his birthright. Certain it is that\r\nhe was a very benevolent person. Whenever any poor fellow was taken\r\nup on grounds which he thought insufficient, he used to attend on his\r\nbehalf and bail him; and thus he had become so popular, that to take\r\ndirect measures against him was out of the question.\r\n\r\nThe steward, accordingly, brought a dozen physicians to examine Sir\r\nHabeas. After consultation, they reported that he was in a very bad way,\r\nand ought not, on any account, to be allowed to stir out for several\r\nmonths. Fortified with this authority, the parish officers put him\r\nto bed, closed his windows, and barred his doors. They paid him every\r\nattention, and from {109}time to time issued bulletins of his health.\r\nThe steward never spoke of him without declaring that he was the best\r\ngentleman in the world; but excellent care was taken that he should\r\nnever stir out of doors.\r\n\r\nWhen this obstacle was removed, the Squire and the steward kept the\r\nparish in excellent order; flogged this man, sent that man to the\r\nstocks, and pushed forward the law-suit with a noble disregard of\r\nexpense. They were, however, wanting either in skill or in fortune.\r\nAnd every thing went against them after their antagonists had begun to\r\nemploy Solicitor Nap.\r\n\r\nWho does not know the name of Solicitor Nap? At what alehouse is not his\r\nbehaviour discussed? In what print-shop is not his picture seen? Yet how\r\nlittle truth has been said about him! Some people hold that he used to\r\ngive laudanum by pints to his sick clerks for his amusement. Others,\r\nwhose number has very much increased since he was killed by the\r\ngaol distemper, conceive that he was the very model of honour and\r\ngood-nature. I shall try to tell the truth about him.\r\n\r\nHe was assuredly an excellent solicitor. In his way he never was\r\nsurpassed. As soon as the parish began to employ him, their cause took\r\na turn. In a very little time they were successful; and Nap became rich.\r\nHe now set up for a gentleman; took possession of the old manor-house;\r\ngot into the commission of the peace, and affected to be on a par with\r\nthe best of the county. He governed the vestries as absolutely as the\r\nold family had done. Yet, to give him his due, he managed things with\r\nfar more discretion than either Sir Lewis or the rioters who had pulled\r\nthe Lords of the Manor down. He kept his servants in tolerable order.\r\nHe {110}removed the steel traps from the highways and the corners of\r\nthe streets. He still left a few indeed In the more exposed parts of his\r\npremises; and set up a board announcing that traps and spring guns were\r\nset in his grounds. He brought the poor parson hack to the parish;\r\nand, though he did not enable him to keep a fine house and a coach as\r\nformerly, he settled him in a snug little cottage, and allowed him a\r\npleasant pad-nag. He whitewashed the church again; and put the stocks,\r\nwhich had been much wanted of late, into good repair.\r\n\r\nWith the neighbouring gentry, however, he was no favourite. He was\r\ncrafty and litigious. He cared nothing for right, if he could raise a\r\npoint of law against them. He pounded their cattle, broke their hedges,\r\nand seduced their tenants from them. He almost ruined Lord Caesar with\r\nactions, in every one of which he was successful. Von Blunderbussen went\r\nto law with him for an alleged trespass, but was cast, and almost ruined\r\nby the costs of suit. He next took a fancy to the seat of Squire Don,\r\nwho was, to say the truth, little better than an idiot. He asked the\r\npoor dupe to dinner, and then threatened to have him tossed in a blanket\r\nunless he would make over his estates to him. The poor Squire signed and\r\nsealed a deed by which the property was assigned to Joe, a brother of\r\nNap’s, in trust for and to the use of Nap himself. The tenants, however,\r\nstood out. They maintained that the estate was entailed, and refused\r\nto pay rents to the new landlord; and in this refusal they were stoutly\r\nsupported by the people in St. George’s.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Nap took it into his head to match with quality, and\r\nnothing would serve him but one of the Miss Germains. Lord Cæsar swore\r\nlike {111}a trooper; but there was no help for it. Nap had twice put\r\nexecutions in his principal residence, and had refused to discharge the\r\nlatter of the two, till he had extorted a bond from his Lordship, which\r\ncompelled him to comply.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE FIRST PAST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. ABRAHAM COWLEY AND MR. JOHN MILTON, TOUCHING\r\nTHE GREAT CIVIL WAR.\r\n\r\nSET DOWN BY A GENTLEMAN OF THE MIDDLE TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n{112}(_Knight’s Quarterly Magazine_, August 1824.)\r\n\r\n                   “Referre sermones Deorum efe\r\n\r\n                   Magna modis tenuare parvis.”--Horace.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have thought it good to set down in writing a memorable debate,\r\nwherein I was a listener, and two men of pregnant parts and great\r\nreputation discoursers; hoping that my friends will not be displeased to\r\nhave a record both of the strange times through which I have lived, and\r\nof the famous men with whom I have conversed. It chanced, in the warm\r\nand beautiful spring of the year 1665, a little before the saddest\r\nsummer that ever London saw, that I went to the Bowling-Green at\r\nPiccadilly, whither, at that time, the best gentry made continual\r\nresort. There I met Mr. Cowley, who had lately left Barnelms. There\r\nwas then a house preparing for him at Chertsey; and, till it should be\r\nfinished, he had come up for a short time to London, that he might\r\nurge a suit to his Grace of Buckingham touching certain lands of\r\nher Majesty’s, whereof he requested a lease. I had the honour to be\r\nfamiliarly acquainted with that worthy gentleman {113}and most excellent\r\npoet, whose death hath been deplored with as general a consent of all\r\nPowers that delight in the woods, or in verse, or in love, as was of old\r\nthat of Daphnis or of Gallus.\r\n\r\nAfter some talk, which it is not material to set down at large,\r\nconcerning his suit and his vexations at the court, where indeed his\r\nhonesty did him more harm than his parts could do him good, I entreated\r\nhim to dine with me at my lodging in the Temple, which he most\r\ncourteously promised. And, that so eminent a guest might not lack a\r\nbetter entertainment than cooks or vintners can provide, I sent to the\r\nhouse of Mr. John Milton, in the Artillery-Walk, to beg that he would\r\nalso be my guest. For, though he had been secretary, first to the\r\nCouncil of State, and, after that, to the Protector, and Mr. Cowley had\r\nheld the same post under the Lord St. Albans in his banishment, I hoped,\r\nnotwithstanding, that they would think themselves rather united by their\r\ncommon art than divided by their different factions. And so indeed it\r\nproved. For, while we sat at table, they talked freely of many men and\r\nthings, as well ancient as modern, with much civility. Nay, Mr. Milton,\r\nwho seldom tasted wine, both because of his singular temperance and\r\nbecause of his gout, did more than once pledge. Mr. Cowley, who was\r\nindeed no hermit in diet. At last, being heated, Mr. Milton begged that\r\nI would open the windows. “Nay,” said I, “if you desire fresh air and\r\ncoolness, what should hinder us, as the evening is fair, from sailing\r\nfor an hour on the river?” To this they both cheerfully consented; and\r\nforth we walked, Mr. Cowley and I leading Mr. Milton between us, to the\r\nTemple Stairs. There we took a boat; and thence we were rowed up the\r\nriver. {114}The wind was pleasant; the evening fine; the sky, the earth,\r\nand the water beautiful to look Upon. But Mr. Cowley and I held our\r\npeace, and said nothing of the gay sights around us, lest we should too\r\nfeelingly remind Mr. Milton of his calamity; whereof, however, he needed\r\nno monitor: for soon he said sadly, “Ah, Mr. Cowley, you are a happy\r\nman. What would I now give but for one more look at the sun, and the\r\nwaters, and the gardens of this fair city!”\r\n\r\n“I know not,” said Mr. Cowley, “whether we ought not rather to envy\r\nyou for that which makes you to envy others: and that specially in this\r\nplace, where all eyes which are not closed in blindness ought to become\r\nfountains of tears. What can we look upon which is not a memorial of\r\nchange and sorrow, of fair things vanished, and evil things done? When\r\nI see the gate of Whitehall, and the stately pillars of the Banqueting\r\nHouse, I cannot choose but think of what I have there seen in former\r\ndays, masques, and pageants, and dances, and smiles, and the waving of\r\ngraceful heads, and the bounding of delicate feet. And then I turn to\r\nthoughts of other things, which even to remember makes me to blush and\r\nweep;--of the great black scaffold, and the axe and block, which were\r\nplaced before those very windows; and the voice seems to sound in mine\r\nears, the lawless and terrible voice, which cried out that the head of a\r\nking was the head of a traitor. There stands Westminster Hall, which who\r\ncan look upon, and not tremble to think how time, and change, and death\r\nconfound the councils of the wise, and beat down the weapons of\r\nthe mighty? How have I seen it surrounded with tens of thousands of\r\npetitioners crying for justice and privilege! How have I heard it shake\r\n{115}with fierce and proud words, which made the hearts of the people\r\nburn within them! Then it is blockaded by dragoons, and cleared by\r\npikemen. And they who have conquered their master go forth trembling at\r\nthe word of their servant. And yet a little while, and the usurper comes\r\nforth from it, in his robe of ermine, with the golden staff in one\r\nhand and the Bible in the other, amidst the roaring of the guns and the\r\nshouting of the people. And yet again a little while, and the doors are\r\nthronged with multitudes in black, and the hearse and the plumes come\r\nforth; and the tyrant is borne, in more than royal pomp, to a royal\r\nsepulchre. A few days more, and his head is fixed to rot on the\r\npinnacles of that very hall where he sat on a throne in his life, and\r\nlay in state after his death. When I think on all these things, to look\r\nround me makes me sad at heart. True it is that God hath restored to us\r\nour old laws, and the rightful line of our kings. Yet, how I know not,\r\nbut it seems to me that something is wanting--that our court hath not\r\nthe old gravity, nor our people the old loyalty. These evil times, like\r\nthe great deluge, have overwhelmed and confused all earthly things. And,\r\neven as those waters, though at last they abated, yet, as the learned\r\nwrite, destroyed all trace of the garden of Eden, so that its place hath\r\nnever since been found, so hath this opening of all the flood-gates of\r\npolitical evil effaced all marks of the ancient political paradise.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, by your favour,” said Mr. Milton, “though, from many circumstances\r\nboth of body and of fortune, I might plead fairer excuses for\r\ndespondency than yourself, I yet look not so sadly either on the past\r\nor on the future. That a deluge hath passed over this our nation, I deny\r\nnot. But I hold it not to be {116}such a deluge as that of which you\r\nspeak; but rather a blessed flood, like those of the Nile, which in\r\nits overflow doth indeed wash away ancient landmarks, and confound\r\nboundaries, and sweep away dwellings, yea, doth give birth to many foul\r\nand dangerous reptiles. Yet hence is the fulness of the granary, the\r\nbeauty of the garden, the nurture of all living things.\r\n\r\n“I remember well, Mr. Cowley, what you have said concerning these things\r\nin your Discourse of the Government of Oliver Cromwell, which my friend\r\nElwood read to me last year. Truly, for elegance and rhetoric, that\r\nessay is to be compared with the finest tractates of Isocrates and\r\nCicero. But neither that nor any other book, nor any events, which with\r\nmost men have, more than any book, weight and authority, have altered my\r\nopinion, that, of all assemblies that ever were in this world, the best\r\nand the most useful was our Long Parliament. I speak not this as wishing\r\nto provoke debate; which neither yet do I decline.”\r\n\r\nMr. Cowley was, as I could see, a little nettled. Yet, as he was a man\r\nof a kind disposition and a most refined courtesy, he put a force upon\r\nhimself, and answered with more vehemence and quickness indeed than was\r\nhis wont, yet not uncivilly. “Surely, Mr. Milton, you speak not as you\r\nthink. I am indeed one of those who believe that God hath reserved to\r\nhimself the censure of kings, and that their crimes and oppressions are\r\nnot to be resisted by the hands of their subjects. Yet can I easily\r\nfind excuse for the violence of such as are stung to madness by grievous\r\ntyranny. But what shall we say for these men? Which of their just\r\ndemands was not granted? Which even of their cruel and unreasonable\r\nrequisitions, so as it {117}were not inconsistent with all law and\r\norder, was refused? Had they not sent Strafford to the block and Laud to\r\nthe Tower? Had they not destroyed the Courts of the High Commission and\r\nthe Star Chamber? Had they not reversed the proceedings confirmed by the\r\nvoices of the judges of England, in the matter of ship-money? Had they\r\nnot taken from the king his ancient and most lawful power touching\r\nthe order of knighthood? Had they not provided that, after their\r\ndissolution, triennial parliaments should be holden, and that their own\r\npower should continue till of their great condescension they should be\r\npleased to resign it themselves? What more could they ask? Was it not\r\nenough that they had taken from their king all his oppressive powers,\r\nand many that were most salutary? Was it not enough that they had filled\r\nhis council-board with his enemies, and his prisons with his adherents?\r\nWas it not enough that they had raised a furious multitude, to shout\r\nand swagger daily under the very windows of his royal palace? Was it\r\nnot enough that they had taken from him the most blessed prerogative of\r\nprincely mercy; that, complaining of intolerance themselves, they had\r\ndenied all toleration to others; that they had urged, against forms,\r\nscruples childish as those of any formalist; that they had persecuted\r\nthe least remnant of the popish rites with the fiercest bitterness of\r\nthe popish spirit? Must they besides all this have full power to command\r\nhis armies, and to massacre his friends?\r\n\r\n“For military command, it was never known in any monarchy, nay, in any\r\nwell ordered republic, that it was committed to the debates of a large\r\nand unsettled assembly. For their other requisition, that he should give\r\nup to their vengeance all who had defended the {118}rights of his crown,\r\nhis honour must have been ruined if he had complied. Is it not therefore\r\nplain that they desired these things only in order that, by refusing,\r\nhis Majesty might give them a pretence for war?\r\n\r\n“Men have often risen up against fraud, against cruelty, against\r\nrapine. But when before was it known that concessions were met with\r\nimportunities, graciousness with insults, the open palm of bounty with\r\nthe clenched fist of malice? Was it like trusty delegates of the Commons\r\nof England, and faithful stewards of their liberty and their wealth, to\r\nengage them for such causes in civil war, which both to liberty and\r\nto wealth is of all things the most hostile. Evil indeed must be the\r\ndisease which is not more tolerable than such a medicine. Those who,\r\neven to save a nation from tyrants, excite it to civil war do in general\r\nbut minister to it the same miserable kind of relief wherewith the\r\nwizards of Pharaoh mocked the Egyptian. We read that, when Moses had\r\nturned their waters into blood, those impious magicians, intending, not\r\nbenefit to the thirsting people, but vain and emulous ostentation of\r\ntheir own art, did themselves also change into blood the water which the\r\nplague had spared. Such sad comfort do those who stir up war minister\r\nto the oppressed. But here where was the oppression? What was the\r\nfavour which had not been granted? What was the evil which had not been\r\nremoved? What further could they desire?”\r\n\r\n“These questions,” said Mr. Milton, austerely, “have indeed often\r\ndeceived the ignorant; but that Mr. Cowley should have been so beguiled,\r\nI marvel. You ask what more the Parliament could desire? I will\r\nanswer you in one word, security. What are votes, and statutes, and\r\nresolutions? They have no {119}eyes to see, no hands to strike and\r\navenge. They must have some safeguard from without. Many things,\r\ntherefore, which in themselves were peradventure hurtful, was this\r\nParliament constrained to ask, lest otherwise good laws and precious\r\nrights should be without defence. Nor did they want a great and signal\r\nexample of this danger. I need not remind you that, many years before,\r\nthe two Houses had presented to the king the Petition of Right, wherein\r\nwere set down all the most valuable privileges of the people of this\r\nrealm. Did not Charles accept it? Did he not declare it to be law? Was\r\nit not as fully enacted as ever were any of those bills of the Long\r\nParliament concerning which you spoke? And were those privileges\r\ntherefore enjoyed more fully by the people? No: the king did from that\r\ntime redouble his oppressions as if to avenge himself for the shame of\r\nhaving been compelled to renounce them. Then were our estates laid under\r\nshameful impositions, our houses ransacked, our bodies imprisoned. Then\r\nwas the steel of the hangman blunted with mangling the ears of harmless\r\nmen. Then our very minds were fettered, and the iron entered into our\r\nsouls. Then we mere compelled to hide our hatred, our sorrow, and our\r\nscorn, to laugh with hidden faces at the mummery of Laud, to curse under\r\nour breath the tyranny of Wentworth. Of old time it was well and nobly\r\nsaid, by one of our kings, that an Englishman ought to be free as his\r\nthoughts. Our prince reversed the maxim; he strove to make our thoughts\r\nas much slaves as ourselves. To sneer at a Romish pageant, to miscall a\r\nlord’s crest, were crimes for which there was no mercy. These were all\r\nthe fruits which we gathered from those excellent laws of the former\r\nParliament, from these solemn promises of {120}the king. Were we to be\r\ndeceived again? Were we again to give subsidies, and receive nothing but\r\npromises? Were we again to make wholesome statutes, and then leave\r\nthem to be broken daily and hourly, until the oppressor should have\r\nsquandered another supply, and should be ready for another perjury? You\r\nask what they could desire which he had not already granted. Let me\r\nask of you another question. What pledge could he give which he had not\r\nalready violated? From the first year of his reign, whenever he had need\r\nof the purses of his Commons to support the revels of Buckingham or the\r\nprocessions of Laud, he had assured them that, as he was a gentleman\r\nand a king, he would sacredly preserve their rights. He had pawned\r\nthose solemn pledges, and pawned them again and again; but when had he\r\nredeemed them? ‘Upon my faith,’--‘Upon my sacred word,’--Upon the honour\r\nof a prince,’--came so easily from his lips, and dwelt so short a time\r\non his mind, that they were as little to be trusted as the ‘By these\r\nhilts’ of an Alsatian dicer.\r\n\r\n“Therefore it is that I praise this Parliament for what else I might\r\nhave condemned. If what he had granted had been granted graciously and\r\nreadily, if what he had before promised had been faithfully observed,\r\nthey could not be defended. It was because he had never yielded the\r\nworst abuse without a long struggle, and seldom without a large bribe:\r\nit was because he had no sooner disentangled himself from his troubles\r\nthan he forgot his promises; and, more like a villainous huckster than a\r\ngreat king, kept both the prerogative and the large price which had been\r\npaid to him to forego it; it was because of these things that it was\r\nnecessary and just to bind with forcible restraints {121}one who could\r\nbe bound neither by law nor honour. Nay, even while he was making those\r\nvery concessions of which you speak, he betrayed his deadly hatred\r\nagainst the people and their friends. Not only did he, contrary to\r\nall that ever was deemed lawful in England, order that members of the\r\nCommons House of Parliament should be impeached of high treason at\r\nthe bar of the Lords; thereby violating both the trial by jury and the\r\nprivileges of the House; but, not content with breaking the law by his\r\nministers, he went himself armed to assail it. In the birth-place and\r\nsanctuary of freedom, in the House itself, nay, in the very chair of the\r\nspeaker, placed for the protection of free speech and privilege, he sat,\r\nrolling his eyes round the benches, searching for those whose blood he\r\ndesired, and singling out his opposers to the slaughter. This most foul\r\noutrage fails. Then again for the old arts. Then come gracious messages.\r\nThen come courteous speeches. Then is again mortgaged his often\r\nforfeited honour. He will never again violate the laws. He will respect\r\ntheir rights as if they were his own. He pledges the dignity of his\r\ncrown; that crown which had been committed to him for the weal of his\r\npeople, and which he never named, but that he might the more easily\r\ndelude and oppress them.\r\n\r\n“The power of the sword, I grant you, was not one to be permanently\r\npossessed by parliament. Neither did that parliament demand it as a\r\npermanent possession. They asked it only for temporary security. Nor can\r\nI see on what conditions they could safely make peace with that false\r\nand wicked king, save such as would deprive him of all power to injure.\r\n\r\n“For civil war, that it is an evil I dispute not. But that it is the\r\ngreatest of evils, that I stoutly deny. It {122}doth indeed appear to\r\nthe misjudging to be a worse calamity than bad government, because its\r\nmiseries are collected together within a short space and time, and may\r\neasily at one view be taken in and perceived. But the misfortunes of\r\nnations ruled by tyrants, being distributed over many centuries and many\r\nplaces, as they are of greater weight and number, so are they of less\r\ndisplay. When the Devil of tyranny hath gone into the body politic he\r\ndeparts not but with struggles, and foaming, and great convulsions.\r\nShall he, therefore, vex it for ever, lest, in going out, he for a\r\nmoment tear and rend it? Truly this argument touching the evils of war\r\nwould better become my friend Elwood, or some other of the people called\r\nQuakers, than a courtier and a cavalier. It applies no more to this war\r\nthan to all others, as well foreign as domestic, and, in this war, no\r\nmore to the Houses than to the king; nay not so much, since he by a\r\nlittle sincerity and moderation might have rendered that needless which\r\ntheir duty to God and man then enforced them to do.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, Mr. Milton,” said Mr. Cowley; “I grieve to hear you speak\r\nthus of that good king. Most unhappy indeed he was, in that he reigned\r\nat a time when the spirit of the then living generation was for freedom,\r\nand the precedents of former ages for prerogative. His case was like to\r\nthat of Christopher Columbus, when he sailed forth on an unknown ocean,\r\nand found that the compass, whereby he shaped his course, had shifted\r\nfrom the north pole whereto before it had constantly pointed. So it\r\nwas with Charles. His compass varied; and therefore he could not tack\r\naright. If he had been an absolute king he would doubtless, like Titus\r\nVespasian, have been called the {123}delight of the human race. If he\r\nhad been a Doge of Venice, or a Stadtholder of Holland, he would never\r\nhave outstepped the laws. But he lived when our government had neither\r\nclear definitions nor strong sanctions. Let, therefore, his faults be\r\nascribed to the time. Of his virtues the praise is his own.\r\n\r\n“Never was there a more gracious prince, or a more proper gentleman.\r\nIn every pleasure he was temperate, in conversation mild and grave, in\r\nfriendship constant, to his servants liberal, to his queen faithful and\r\nloving, in battle brave, in sorrow and captivity resolved, in death most\r\nChristian and forgiving.\r\n\r\n“For his oppressions, let us look at the former history of this realm.\r\nJames was never accounted a tyrant. Elizabeth is esteemed to have been\r\nthe mother of her people. Were they less arbitrary? Did they never lay\r\nhands on the purses of their subjects but by Act of Parliament? Did they\r\nnever confine insolent and disobedient men but in due course of law? Was\r\nthe court of Star Chamber less active? Were the ears of libellers more\r\nsafe? I pray you, let not king Charles be thus dealt with. It was enough\r\nthat in his life he was tried for an alleged breach of laws which none\r\never heard named till they were discovered for his destruction. Let not\r\nhis fame be treated as was his sacred and anointed body. Let not his\r\nmemory be tried by principles found out _ex post facto_. Let us not\r\njudge by the spirit of one generation a man whose disposition had been\r\nformed by the temper and fashion of another.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, but conceive me, Mr. Cowley,” said Mr. Milton; “inasmuch as, at\r\nthe beginning of his reign, he imitated those who had governed before\r\nhim, I blame him not. To expect that kings will, of their {124}own free\r\nchoice, abridge their prerogative, were argument of but slender wisdom.\r\nWhatever, therefore, lawless, unjust, or cruel, he either did or\r\npermitted during the first years of his reign, I pass by. But for what\r\nwas done after that he had solemnly given his consent to the Petition\r\nof Right, where shall we find defence? Let it be supposed, which yet I\r\nconcede not, that the tyranny of his father and of Queen Elizabeth had\r\nbeen no less rigorous than was his. But had his father, had that queen,\r\nsworn, like him, to abstain from those rigours. Had they, like him, for\r\ngood and valuable consideration, aliened their hurtful prerogatives?\r\nSurely not: from whatever excuse you can plead for him he had wholly\r\nexcluded himself. The borders of countries, we know, are mostly the\r\nseats of perpetual wars and tumults. It was the same with the undefined\r\nfrontiers, which of old separated privilege and prerogative. They were\r\nthe debatable land of our polity. It was no marvel if, both on the one\r\nside and on the other, inroads were often made. But, when treaties have\r\nbeen concluded, spaces measured, lines drawn, landmarks set up, that\r\nwhich before might pass for innocent error or just reprisal becomes\r\nrobbery, perjury, deadly sin. He knew not, you say, which of his powers\r\nwere founded on ancient law, and which only on vicious example. But had\r\nhe not read the Petition of Right? Had not proclamation been made from\r\nhis throne; _Soit fait comme il est desiré?_\r\n\r\n“For his private virtues they are beside the question. Remember you\r\nnot,” and Mr. Milton smiled, but somewhat sternly, “what Dr. Caius saith\r\nin the Merry Wives of Shakspeare? ‘What shall the honest man do in my\r\ncloset? There is no honest man that shall come in my closet.’ Even so\r\nsay I. There is no good {125}man who shall make us his slaves. If he\r\nbreak his word to his people, is it a sufficient defence that he keeps\r\nit to his companions? If he oppress and extort all day, shall he be held\r\nblameless because he prayeth at night and morning? If he be insatiable\r\nin plunder and revenge, shall we pass it by because in meat and drink\r\nhe is temperate? If he have lived like a tyrant, shall all be forgotten\r\nbecause he hath died like a martyr?\r\n\r\n“He was a man, as I think, who had so much semblance of virtues as might\r\nmake his vices most dangerous. He was not a tyrant after our wonted\r\nEnglish model. The second Richard, the second and fourth Edwards, and\r\nthe eighth Harry, were men profuse, gay, boisterous; lovers of women and\r\nof wine, of no outward sanctity or gravity. Charles was a ruler after\r\nthe Italian fashion; grave, demure, of a solemn carriage, and a sober\r\ndiet; as constant at prayers as a priest, as heedless of oaths as an\r\natheist.”\r\n\r\nMr. Cowley answered somewhat sharply: “I am sorry, Sir, to hear you\r\nspeak thus. I had hoped that the vehemence of spirit which was caused by\r\nthese violent times had now abated. Yet, sure, Mr. Milton, whatever you\r\nmay think of the character of King Charles, you will not still justify\r\nhis murder.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Mr. Milton, “I must have been of a hard and strange nature,\r\nif the vehemence which was imputed to me in my younger days had not been\r\ndiminished by the afflictions wherewith it hath pleased Almighty God\r\nto chasten my age. I will not now defend all that I may heretofore have\r\nwritten. But this I say, that I perceive not wherefore a king should be\r\nexempted from all punishment. Is it just that where most is given least\r\nshould be required? Or {126}politic that where there is the greatest\r\npower to injure there should be no danger to restrain? But, you will\r\nsay, there is no such law. Such a law there is. There is the law of\r\nself-preservation written by God himself on our hearts. There is the\r\nprimal compact and bond of society, not graven on stone, nor sealed with\r\nwax, nor put down on parchment, nor set forth in any express form of\r\nwords by men when of old they came together; but implied in the very act\r\nthat they so came together, pre-supposed in all subsequent law, not to\r\nbe repealed by any authority, not invalidated by being omitted in any\r\ncode; inasmuch as from thence are all codes and all authority.\r\n\r\n“Neither do I well see wherefore you cavaliers, and, indeed, many of us\r\nwhom you merrily call Roundheads, distinguish between those who fought\r\nagainst King Charles, and specially after the second commission given to\r\nSir Thomas Fairfax, and those who condemned him to death. Sure, if his\r\nperson were inviolable, it was as wicked to lift the sword against it at\r\nNaseby as the axe at Whitehall. If his life might justly be taken, why\r\nnot in course of trial as well as by right of war?\r\n\r\n“Thus much in general as touching the right. But, for the execution of\r\nKing Charles in particular, I will not now undertake to defend it. Death\r\nis inflicted, not that the culprit may die, but that the state may be\r\nthereby advantaged. And, from all that I know, I think that the death of\r\nKing Charles hath more hindered than advanced the liberties of England.\r\n\r\n“First, he left an heir. He was in captivity. The heir was in freedom.\r\nHe was odious to the Scots. The heir was favoured by them. To kill\r\nthe captive therefore, whereby the heir, in the apprehension of all\r\n{127}royalists, became forthwith king--what was it, in truth, but to set\r\ntheir captive free, and to give him besides other great advantages?\r\n\r\n“Next, it was a deed most odious to the people, and not only to your\r\nparty, but to many among ourselves; and, as it is perilous for any\r\ngovernment to outrage the public opinion, so most was it perilous for a\r\ngovernment which had from that opinion alone its birth, its nurture, and\r\nits defence.\r\n\r\n“Yet doth not this properly belong to our dispute; nor can these faults\r\nbe justly charged upon that most renowned parliament. For, as you know,\r\nthe high court of justice was not established until the house had been\r\npurged of such members as were adverse to the army, and brought wholly\r\nunder the control of the chief officers.”\r\n\r\n“And who,” said Mr. Cowley, “levied that army? Who commissioned those\r\nofficers? Was not the fate of the Commons as justly deserved as was that\r\nof Diomedes, who was devoured by those horses whom he had himself taught\r\nto feed on the flesh and blood of men? How could they hope that others\r\nwould respect laws which they had themselves insulted; that swords which\r\nhad been drawn against the prerogatives of the king would be put up at\r\nan ordinance of the Commons? It was believed, of old, that there were\r\nsome devils easily raised but never to be laid; insomuch that, if a\r\nmagician called them up, he should be forced to find them always some\r\nemployment; for, though they would do all his bidding, yet, if he left\r\nthem but for one moment without some work of evil to perform, they would\r\nturn their claws against himself. Such a fiend is an army. They who\r\nevoke it cannot dismiss it. They are at once its masters and its slaves.\r\nLet {128}them not fail to find for it task after task of blood and\r\nrapine. Let them not leave it for a moment in repose, lest it tear them\r\nin pieces.\r\n\r\n“Thus was it with that famous assembly. They formed a force which they\r\ncould neither govern nor resist. They made it powerful. They made it\r\nfanatical. As if military insolence were not of itself sufficiently\r\ndangerous, they heightened it with spiritual pride,--they encouraged\r\ntheir soldiers to rave from the tops of tubs against the men of Belial,\r\ntill every trooper thought himself a prophet. They taught them to abuse\r\npopery, till every drummer fancied that he was as infallible as a pope.\r\n\r\n“Then it was that religion changed her nature. She was no longer\r\nthe parent of arts and letters, of wholesome knowledge, of innocent\r\npleasures, of blessed household smiles. In their place came sour faces,\r\nwhining voices, the chattering of fools, the yells of madmen. Then men\r\nfasted from meat and drink, who fasted not from bribes and blood. Then\r\nmen frowned at stage-plays, who smiled at massacres. Then men preached\r\nagainst painted faces, who felt no remorse for their own most painted\r\nlives. Religion had been a pole-star to light and to guide. It was now\r\nmore like to that ominous star in the book of the Apocalypse, which\r\nfell from heaven upon the fountains and rivers and changed them into\r\nwormwood; for even so did it descend from its high and celestial\r\ndwelling-place to plague this earth, and to turn into bitterness all\r\nthat was sweet, and into poison all that was nourishing.\r\n\r\n“Therefore it was not strange that such things should follow. They who\r\nhad closed the barriers of London against the king could not defend\r\nthem against their own creatures. They who had so stoutly cried {129}for\r\nprivilege, when that prince, most unadvisedly no doubt, came among them\r\nto demand their members, durst not wag their fingers when Oliver filled\r\ntheir hall with soldiers, gave their mace to a corporal, put their keys\r\nin his pocket, and drove them forth with base terms, borrowed half from\r\nthe conventicle and half from the ale-house. Then were we, like the\r\ntrees of the forest in holy writ, given over to the rule of the bramble;\r\nthen from the basest of the shrubs came forth the fire which devoured\r\nthe cedars of Lebanon. We bowed down before a man of mean birth, of\r\nungraceful demeanour, of stammering and most vulgar utterance, of\r\nscandalous and notorious hypocrisy. Our laws were made and unmade at his\r\npleasure; the constitution of our parliaments changed by his writ and\r\nproclamation; our persons imprisoned; our property plundered; our lands\r\nand houses overrun with soldiers; and the great charter itself was\r\nbut argument for a scurrilous jest; and for all this we may thank that\r\nparliament: for never, unless they had so violently shaken the vessel,\r\ncould such foul dregs have risen to the top.”\r\n\r\nThen answered Mr. Milton: “What you have now said comprehends so great a\r\nnumber of subjects, that it would require, not an evening’s sail on the\r\nThames, but rather a voyage to the Indies, accurately to treat of all:\r\nyet, in as few words as I may, I will explain my sense of these matters.\r\n\r\n“First, as to the army. An army, as you have well set forth, is always\r\na weapon dangerous to those who use it; yet he who falls among thieves\r\nspares not to fire his musquetoon, because he may be slain if it burst\r\nin his hand. Nor must states refrain from defending themselves, lest\r\ntheir defenders should at last turn {130}against them. Nevertheless,\r\nagainst this danger statesmen should carefully provide; and, that they\r\nmay do so, they should take especial care that neither the officers nor\r\nthe soldiers do forget that they are also citizens. I do believe that\r\nthe English army would have continued to obey the parliament with all\r\nduty, but for one act, which, as it was in intention, in seeming, and in\r\nimmediate effect, worthy to be compared with the most famous in history,\r\nso was it, in its final consequence, most injurious. I speak of that\r\nordinance called the _self-denying_, and of the new model of the army.\r\nBy those measures the Commons gave up the command of their forces into\r\nthe hands of men who were not of themselves. Hence, doubtless, derived\r\nno small honour to that noble assembly, which sacrificed to the hope of\r\npublic good the assurance of private advantage. And, as to the conduct\r\nof the war, the scheme prospered. Witness the battle of Naseby, and the\r\nmemorable exploits of Fairfaix in the west. But thereby the Parliament\r\nlost that hold on the soldiers and that power to control them, which\r\nthey retained while every regiment was commanded by their own members.\r\nPoliticians there be, who would wholly divide the legislative from\r\nthe executive power. In the golden age this may have succeeded; in the\r\nmillennium it may succeed again. But, where great armies and great taxes\r\nare required, there the executive government must always hold a great\r\nauthority, which authority, that it may not oppress and destroy the\r\nlegislature, must be in some manner blended with it. The leaders of\r\nforeign mercenaries have always been most dangerous to a country. The\r\nofficers of native armies, deprived of the civil privileges of other\r\nmen, are as much to be feared. This was the great {131}error of that\r\nParliament; and, though an error it were, it was an error generous,\r\nvirtuous, and more to be deplored than censured.\r\n\r\n“Hence came the power of the army and its leaders, and especially of\r\nthat most famous leader, whom both in our conversation to-day, and in\r\nthat discourse, whereon I before touched, you have, in my poor opinion,\r\nfar too roughly handled. Wherefore you speak contemptibly of his parts\r\nI know not; but I suspect that you are not free from the error common to\r\nstudious and speculative men. Because Oliver was an ungraceful orator,\r\nand never said, either in public or private, anything memorable, you\r\nwill have it that he was of a mean capacity. Sure this is unjust. Many\r\nmen have there been ignorant of letters, without wit, without eloquence,\r\nwho yet had the wisdom to devise, and the courage to perform, that which\r\nthey lacked language to explain. Such men often, in troubled times, have\r\nworked out the deliverance of nations and their own greatness, not\r\nby logic, not by rhetoric, but by wariness in success, by calmness in\r\ndanger, by fierce and stubborn resolution in all adversity. The hearts\r\nof men are their books; events are their tutors; great actions are their\r\neloquence: and such an one, in my judgment, was his late Highness, who,\r\nif none were to treat his name scornfully now who shook not at the sound\r\nof it while he lived, would, by very few, be mentioned otherwise than\r\nwith reverence. His own deeds shall avouch him for a great statesman,\r\na great soldier, a true lover of his country, a merciful and generous\r\nconqueror.\r\n\r\n“For his faults, let us reflect that they who seem to lead are\r\noftentimes most constrained to follow. They who will mix with men, and\r\nspecially they who will {132}govern them, must, in many things, obey\r\nthem. They who will yield to no such conditions may be hermits, but\r\ncannot be generals and statesmen. If a man will walk straight forward\r\nwithout turning to the right or the left, he must walk in a desert, and\r\nnot in Cheapside.\r\n\r\n“Thus was he enforced to do many things which jumped not with his\r\ninclination nor made for his honour; because the army, on which alone he\r\ncould depend for power and life, might not otherwise be contented. And\r\nI, for mine own part, marvel less that he sometimes was fain to indulge\r\ntheir violence than that he could so often restrain it.\r\n\r\n“In that he dissolved the Parliament, I praise him It then was so\r\ndiminished in numbers, as well by the death as by the exclusion of\r\nmembers, that it was no longer the same assembly; and, if at that time\r\nit had made itself perpetual, we should have been governed, not by an\r\nEnglish House of Commons, but by a Venetian Council.\r\n\r\n“If in his following rule he overstepped the laws, I pity rather than\r\ncondemn him. He may be compared to that Mæandrius of Samos, of whom\r\nHerodotus saith, in his Thalia, that, wishing to be of all men the most\r\njust, he was not able; for after the death of Polycrates he offered\r\nfreedom to the people; and not till certain of them threatened to call\r\nhim to a reckoning for what he had formerly done, did he change his\r\npurpose, and make himself a tyrant, lest he should be treated as a\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\n“Such was the case of Oliver. He gave to his country a form of\r\ngovernment so free and admirable that, in near six thousand years,\r\nhuman wisdom hath never devised any more excellent contrivance for human\r\nhappiness. To himself he reserved so little power {133}that it would\r\nscarcely have sufficed for his safety, and it is a marvel that it could\r\nsuffice for his ambition. When, after that, he found that the members of\r\nhis parliament disputed his right even to that small authority which he\r\nhad kept, when he might have kept all, then indeed I own that he began\r\nto govern by the sword those who would not suffer him to govern by the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n“But, for the rest, what sovereign was ever more princely in pardoning\r\ninjuries, in conquering enemies, in extending the dominions and\r\nthe renown of his people? What sea, what shore did he not mark with\r\nimperishable memorials of his friendship or his vengeance? The gold of\r\nSpain, the steel of Sweden, the ten thousand sails of Holland, availed\r\nnothing against him. While every foreign state trembled at our arms, we\r\nsat secure from all assault. War, which often so strangely troubles both\r\nhusbandry and commerce, never silenced the song of our reapers, or the\r\nsound of our looms. Justice was equally administered; God was freely\r\nworshipped.\r\n\r\n“Now look at that which we have taken in exchange. With the restored\r\nking have come over to us vices of every sort, and most the basest and\r\nmost shameful,--lust without love--servitude, without loyalty--foulness\r\nof speech--dishonesty of dealing--grinning contempt of all things good\r\nand generous. The throne is surrounded by men whom the former Charles\r\nwould have spurned from his footstool. The altar is served by slaves\r\nwhose knees are supple to every being but God. Rhymers, whose books the\r\nhangman should burn, pandars actors, and buffoons, these drink a health\r\nand throw a main with the King; these have stars on their breasts and\r\ngold sticks in {134}their hands; these shut out from his presence the\r\nbest and bravest of those who bled for his house. Even so doth God\r\nvisit those who know not how to value freedom. He gives them over to the\r\ntyranny which they have desired.”\r\n\r\n“I will not,” said Mr. Cowley, “dispute with you on this argument. But,\r\nif it be as you say, how can you maintain that England hath been so\r\ngreatly advantaged by the rebellion?”\r\n\r\n“Understand me rightly, Sir,” said Mr. Milton. “This nation is not given\r\nover to slavery and vice. We tasted indeed the fruits of liberty before\r\nthey had well ripened. Their flavour was harsh and bitter; and we turned\r\nfrom them with loathing to the sweeter poisons of servitude. This is\r\nbut for a time. England is sleeping on the lap of Dalilah, traitorously\r\nchained, but not yet shorn of strength. Let the cry be once heard--the\r\nPhilistines be upon thee; and at once that sleep will be broken, and\r\nthose chains will be as flax in the fire. The great Parliament hath left\r\nbehind it in our hearts and minds a hatred of tyrants, a just knowledge\r\nof our rights, a scorn of vain and deluding names; and that the\r\nrevellers of Whitehall shall surely find. The sun is darkened; but it is\r\nonly for a moment: it is but an eclipse; though all birds of evil omen\r\nhave begun to scream, and all ravenous beasts have gone forth to prey,\r\nthinking it to be midnight. Woe to them if they be abroad when the rays\r\nagain shine forth!\r\n\r\n“The king hath judged ill. Had he been wise he would have remembered\r\nthat he owed his restoration only to confusions which had wearied us\r\nout, and made us eager for repose. He would have known that the folly\r\nand perfidy of a prince would restore to the good {135}old cause many\r\nhearts which had been alienated thence by the turbulence of factions;\r\nfor, if I know aught of history, or of the heart of man, he will soon\r\nlearn that the last champion of the people was not destroyed when he\r\nmurdered Vane, nor seduced when he beguiled Fairfax.”\r\n\r\nMr. Cowley seemed to me not to take much amiss what Mr. Milton had said\r\ntouching that thankless court, which had indeed but poorly requited his\r\nown good service. He only said, therefore, “Another rebellion! Alas!\r\nalas! Mr. Milton! If there be no choice but between despotism and\r\nanarchy, I prefer despotism.”\r\n\r\n“Many men,” said Mr. Milton, “have floridly and ingeniously compared\r\nanarchy and despotism; but they who so amuse themselves do but look at\r\nseparate parts of that which is truly one great whole. Each is the cause\r\nand the effect of the other; the evils of either are the evils of\r\nboth. Thus do states move on in the same eternal cycle, which, from the\r\nremotest point, brings them back again to the same sad starting-post:\r\nand, till both those who govern and those who obey shall learn and mark\r\nthis great truth, men can expect little through the future, as they\r\nhave known little through the past, save vicissitudes of extreme evils,\r\nalternately producing and produced.\r\n\r\n“When will rulers learn that, where liberty is not security and order\r\ncan never be? We talk of absolute power; but all power hath limits,\r\nwhich, if not fixed by the moderation of the governors, will be fixed\r\nby the force of the governed. Sovereigns may send their opposers to\r\ndungeons; they may clear out a senate-house with soldiers; they may\r\nenlist armies of spies; they may hang scores of the disaffected\r\nin chains at every cross road; but what power shall stand in that\r\n{136}frightful time when rebellion hath become a less evil than\r\nendurance? Who shall dissolve that terrible tribunal, which, in the\r\nhearts of the oppressed, denounces against the oppressor the doom of\r\nits wild justice? Who shall repeal the law of self-defence? What arms\r\nor discipline shall resist the strength of famine and despair? How often\r\nwere the ancient Cæsars dragged from their golden palaces, stripped of\r\ntheir purple robes, mangled, stoned, defiled with filth, pierced with\r\nhooks, hurled into Tiber? How often have the Eastern Sultans perished\r\nby the sabres of their own janissaries, or the bow-strings of their own\r\nmutes! For no power which is not limited by laws can ever be protected\r\nby them. Small, therefore, is the wisdom of those who would fly to\r\nservitude as if it were a refuge from commotion; for anarchy is the sure\r\nconsequence of tyranny. That governments may be safe, nations must be\r\nfree. Their passions must have an outlet provided, lest they make one.\r\n\r\n“When I was at Naples, I went with Signor Manso, a gentleman of\r\nexcellent parts and breeding, who had been the familiar friend of that\r\nfamous poet Torquato Tasso, to see the burning mountain Vesuvius. I\r\nwondered how the peasants could venture to dwell so fearlessly and\r\ncheerfully on its sides, when the lava was flowing from its summit;\r\nbut Manso smiled, and told me that when the fire descends freely they\r\nretreat before it without haste or fear. They can tell how fast it will\r\nmove, and how far; and they know, moreover, that, though it may work\r\nsome little damage, it will soon cover the fields over which it hath\r\npassed with rich vineyards and sweet flowers. But, when the flames are\r\npent up in the mountain, then it is that they have reason to fear; then\r\nit is that the earth sinks and the {137}sea swells; then cities\r\nare swallowed up; and their place knoweth them no more. So it is in\r\npolitics: where the people is most closely restrained, there it gives\r\nthe greatest shocks to peace and order; therefore would I say to all\r\nkings, let your demagogues lead crowds, lest they lead armies; let them\r\nbluster, lest they massacre; a little turbulence is, as it were, the\r\nrainbow of the state; it shows indeed that there is a passing shower;\r\nbut it is a pledge that there shall be no deluge.”\r\n\r\n“This is true,” said Mr. Cowley: “yet these admonitions are not less\r\nneedful to subjects than to sovereigns.”\r\n\r\n“Surely,” said Mr. Milton; “and, that I may end this long debate with a\r\nfew words in which we shall both agree, I hold that, as freedom is the\r\nonly safeguard of governments, so are order and moderation generally\r\nnecessary to preserve freedom. Even the vainest opinions of men are not\r\nto be outraged by those who propose to themselves the happiness of men\r\nfor their end, and who must work with the passions of men for their\r\nmeans. The blind reverence for things ancient is indeed so foolish\r\nthat it might make a wise man laugh, if it were not also sometimes so\r\nmischievous that it would rather make a good man weep. Yet, since it may\r\nnot be wholly cured, it must be discreetly indulged; and therefore those\r\nwho would amend evil laws should consider rather how much it may be safe\r\nto spare, than how much it may be possible to change. Have you not heard\r\nthat men who have been shut up for many years in dungeons shrink if they\r\nsee the light, and fall down if their irons be struck off. And so, when\r\nnations have long been in the house of bondage, the chains which have\r\ncrippled them are necessary to {138}support them, the darkness which\r\nhath weakened their sight is necessary to preserve it. Therefore release\r\nthem not too rashly, lest they curse their freedom and pine for their\r\nprison.\r\n\r\n“I think indeed that the renowned Parliament, of which we have talked so\r\nmuch, did show, until it became subject to the soldiers, a singular\r\nand admirable moderation, in such times scarcely to be hoped, and\r\nmost worthy to be an example to all that shall come after. But on this\r\nargument I have said enough: and I will therefore only pray to Almighty\r\nGod that those who shall, in future times, stand forth in defence of\r\nour liberties, as well civil as religious, may adorn the good cause\r\nby mercy, prudence, and soberness, to the glory of his name and the\r\nhappiness and honour of the English people.”\r\n\r\nAnd so ended that discourse; and not long after we were set on shore\r\nagain at the Temple-gardens, and there parted company: and the same\r\nevening I took notes of what had been said, which I have here more fully\r\nset down, from regard both to the fame of the men, and the importance of\r\nthe subject-matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE ATHENIAN ORATORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n{139}(_Knight’s Quarterly Magazine_, August 1824.)\r\n\r\n                   “To the famous orators repair,\r\n\r\n                   Those ancient, whose resistless eloquence\r\n\r\n                   Wielded at will that fierce démocratie,\r\n\r\n                   Shook the arsenal, and fulmined over Greece\r\n\r\n                   To Macedon and Artaxerxes’ throne.”--Milton.\r\n\r\nThe celebrity of the great classical writers is confined within no\r\nlimits, except those which separate civilized from savage man. Their\r\nworks are the common property of every polished nation. They have\r\nfurnished subjects for the painter, and models for the poet. In the\r\nminds of the educated classes throughout Europe, their names\r\nare indissolubly associated with the endearing recollections of\r\nchildhood,--the old school room,--the dog-eared grammar,--the first\r\nprize,--the tears so often shed and so quickly dried. So great is the\r\nveneration with which they are regarded, that even the editors and\r\ncommentators who perform the lowest menial offices to their memory, are\r\nconsidered, like the equerries and chamberlains of sovereign princes,\r\nas entitled to a high rank in the table of literary precedence. It is,\r\ntherefore, somewhat singular that their productions should so rarely\r\nhave been examined on just and philosophical principles of criticism.\r\n\r\nThe ancient writers themselves afford us but little {140}assistance.\r\nWhen they particularise, they are commonly trivial: when they would\r\ngeneralise, they become indistinct. An exception must, indeed, be made\r\nin favour of Aristotle. Both in analysis and in combination, that great\r\nman was without a rival. No philosopher has ever possessed, in an equal\r\ndegree, the talent either of separating established systems into their\r\nprimary elements, or of connecting detached phenomena in harmonious\r\nsystems. He was the great fashioner of the intellectual chaos; he\r\nchanged its darkness into light, and its discord into order. He brought\r\nto literary researches the same vigor and amplitude of mind to which\r\nboth physical and metaphysical science are so greatly indebted. His\r\nfundamental principles of criticism are excellent. To cite only a\r\nsingle instance;--the doctrine which he established, that poetry is an\r\nimitative art, when justly understood, is to the critic what the compass\r\nis to the navigator. With it he may venture upon the most extensive\r\nexcursions. Without it he must creep cautiously along the coast, or lose\r\nhimself in a trackless expanse, and trust, at best, to the guidance of\r\nan occasional star. It is a discovery which changes a caprice into a\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe general propositions of Aristotle are valuable. But the merit of the\r\nsuperstructure bears no proportion to that of the foundation. This is\r\npartly to be ascribed to the character of the philosopher, who, though\r\nqualified to do all that could be done by the resolving and combining\r\npowers of the understanding, seems not to have possessed much of\r\nsensibility or imagination. Partly, also, it may be attributed to the\r\ndeficiency of materials. The great works of genius which then existed\r\nwere not either sufficiently numerous {141}or sufficiently varied to\r\nenable any man to form a perfect code of literature. To require that a\r\ncritic should conceive classes of composition which had never existed,\r\nand then investigate their principles, would be as unreasonable as the\r\ndemand of Nebuchadnezzar, who expected his magicians first to tell him\r\nhis dream and then to interpret it.\r\n\r\nWith all his deficiencies, Aristotle was the most enlightened and\r\nprofound critic of antiquity. Dionysius was far from possessing the same\r\nexquisite subtilty, or the same vast comprehension. But he had access\r\nto a much greater number of specimens; and he had devoted himself, as\r\nit appears, more exclusively to the study of elegant literature. His\r\npeculiar judgments are of more value than his general principles. He is\r\nonly the historian of literature. Aristotle is its philosopher.\r\n\r\nQuintilian applied to general literature the same principles by which he\r\nhad been accustomed to judge of the declamations of his pupils. He looks\r\nfor nothing but rhetoric, and rhetoric not of the highest order. He\r\nspeaks coldly of the incomparable works of Æschylus. He admires, beyond\r\nexpression, those inexhaustible mines of common-places, the plays of\r\nEuripides. He bestows a few vague words on the poetical character of\r\nHomer. He then proceeds to consider him merely as an orator. An orator\r\nHomer doubtless was, and a great orator. But surely nothing is more\r\nremarkable, in his admirable works, than the art with which his\r\noratorical powers are made subservient to the purposes of poetry. Nor\r\ncan I think Quintilian a great critic in his own province. Just as are\r\nmany of his remarks, beautiful as are many of his illustrations, we can\r\nperpetually detect in his thoughts {142}that flavour which the soil of\r\ndespotism generally communicates to all the fruits of genius. Eloquence\r\nwas, in his time, little more than a condiment which served to stimulate\r\nin a despot the jaded appetite for panegyric, an amusement for\r\nthe travelled nobles and the blue-stocking matrons of Rome. It is,\r\ntherefore, with him, rather a sport than a war; it is a contest of\r\nfoils, not of swords. He appears to think more of the grace of the\r\nattitude than of the direction and vigour of the thrust. It must be\r\nacknowledged, in justice to Quintilian, that this is an error to which\r\nCicero has too often given the sanction, both of his precept and of his\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nLonginus seems to have had great sensibility, but little discrimination.\r\nHe gives us eloquent sentences, but no principles. It was happily\r\nsaid that Montesquieu ought to have changed the name of his book from\r\n_L’Esprit des Lois to L’Esprit sur les Lois_. In the same manner the\r\nphilosopher of Palmyra ought to have entitled his famous work, not\r\n“Longinus on the Sublime,” but “The Sublimities of Longinus.” The origin\r\nof the sublime is one of the most curious and interesting subjects of\r\ninquiry that can occupy the attention of a critic. In our own country it\r\nhas been discussed, with great ability, and, I think, with very little\r\nsuccess, by Burke and Dugald Stuart. Longinus dispenses himself from all\r\ninvestigations of this nature, by telling his friend Terentianus that he\r\nalready knows every thing than can be said upon the question. It is to\r\nbe regretted that Terentianus did not impart some of his knowledge to\r\nhis instructor: for from Longinus we learn only that sublimity means\r\nheight--or elevation. This name, so commodiously vague, is applied\r\n{143}indifferently to the noble prayer of Ajax in the Iliad, and to a\r\npassage of Plato about the human body, as full of conceits as an ode of\r\nCowley. Having no fixed standard, Longinus is right only by accident. He\r\nis rather a fancier than a critic.\r\n\r\nModern writers have been prevented by many causes from supplying the\r\ndeficiencies of their classical predecessors. At the time of the revival\r\nof literature, no man could, without great and painful labour, acquire\r\nan accurate and elegant knowledge of the ancient languages. And,\r\nunfortunately, those grammatical and philological studies, without which\r\nit was impossible to understand the great works of Athenian and Roman\r\ngenius, have a tendency to contract the views and deaden the sensibility\r\nof those who follow them with extreme assiduity. A powerful mind, which\r\nhas been long employed in such studies, may be compared to the gigantic\r\nspirit in the Arabian tale, who was persuaded to contract himself to\r\nsmall dimensions in order to enter within the enchanted vessel, and when\r\nhis prison had been closed upon him, found himself unable to escape\r\nfrom the narrow boundaries to the measure of which he had reduced his\r\nstature. When the means have long been the objects of application, they\r\nare naturally substituted for the end. It was said, by Eugene of Savoy,\r\nthat the greatest generals have commonly been those who have been at\r\nonce raised to command, and introduced to the great operations of war,\r\nwithout being employed in the petty calculations and manoeuvres which\r\nemploy the time of an inferior officer. In literature the principle is\r\nequally sound. The great tactics of criticism will, in general, be best\r\nunderstood by those who have not had much practice in drilling syllables\r\nand particles. {144}I remember to have observed among the French Anas\r\na ludicrous instance of this. A scholar, doubtless of great learning,\r\nrecommends the study of some long Latin treatise, of which I now forget\r\nthe name, on the religion, manners, government, and language of the\r\nearly Greeks. “For there,” says he, “you will learn every thing of\r\nimportance that is contained in the Iliad and Odyssey, without the\r\ntrouble of reading two such tedious books.” Alas! it had not occurred to\r\nthe poor gentleman that all the knowledge to which he attached so\r\nmuch value was useful only as it illustrated the great poems which\r\nhe despised, and would be as worthless for any other purpose as the\r\nmythology of Caffraria, or the vocabulary of Otaheite.\r\n\r\nOf those scholars who have disdained to confine themselves to verbal\r\ncriticism few have been successful. The ancient languages have,\r\ngenerally, a magical influence on their faculties. They were “fools\r\ncalled into a circle by Greek invocations.” The Iliad and Æneid were\r\nto them not books, but curiosities, or rather reliques. They no more\r\nadmired those works for their merits than a good Catholic venerates\r\nthe house of the Virgin at Loretto for its architecture. Whatever was\r\nclassical was good. Homer was a great poet; and so was Callimachus. The\r\nepistles of Cicero were fine; and so were those of Phalaris. Even with\r\nrespect to questions of evidence they fell into the same error. The\r\nauthority of all narrations, written in Greek or Latin, was the same\r\nwith them. It never crossed their minds that the lapse of five hundred\r\nyears, or the distance of five hundred leagues, could affect the\r\naccuracy of a narration;--that Livy could be a less veracious historian\r\nthan Polybius;--or that Plutarch could know less about the friends of\r\nXenophon {145}than Xenophon himself. Deceived by the distance of time,\r\nthey seem to consider all the Classics as contemporaries; just as I have\r\nknown people in England, deceived by the distance of place, take it for\r\ngranted that all persons who live in India are neighbours, and ask an\r\ninhabitant of Bombay about the health of an acquaintance at Calcutta.\r\nIt is to be hoped that no barbarian deluge will ever again pass over\r\nEurope. But, should such a calamity happen, it seems not improbable that\r\nsome future Rollin or Gillies will compile a history of England from\r\nMiss Porter’s Scottish Chiefs, Miss Lee’s Recess, and Sir Nathaniel\r\nWraxall’s Memoirs.\r\n\r\nIt is surely time that ancient literature should be examined in a\r\ndifferent manner, without pedantical prepossessions, but with a just\r\nallowance, at the same time, for the difference of circumstances and\r\nmanners. I am far from pretending to the knowledge or ability which\r\nsuch a task would require. All that I mean to offer is a collection of\r\ndesultory remarks upon a most interesting portion of Greek literature.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted-whether any compositions which have ever been produced\r\nin the world are equally perfect in their kind with the great Athenian\r\norations. Genius is subject to the same laws which regulate the\r\nproduction of cotton and molasses. The supply adjusts itself to the\r\ndemand. The quantity may be diminished by restrictions, and multiplied\r\nby bounties. The singular excellence to which eloquence attained at\r\nAthens is to be mainly attributed to the influence which it exerted\r\nthere. In turbulent times, under a constitution purely democratic,\r\namong a people educated exactly to that point at which men are most\r\nsusceptible of strong and sudden impressions, acute, but {146}not sound\r\nreasoners, warm in their feelings, unfixed in their principles,\r\nand passionate admirers of fine composition, oratory received such\r\nencouragement as it has never since obtained.\r\n\r\nThe taste and knowledge of the Athenian people was a favourite object of\r\nthe contemptuous derision of Samuel Johnson; a man who knew nothing of\r\nGreek literature beyond the common school-books, and who seems to have\r\nbrought to what he had read scarcely more than the discernment of a\r\ncommon school-boy. He used to assert, with that arrogant absurdity\r\nwhich, in spite of his great abilities and virtues, renders him, perhaps\r\nthe most ridiculous character in literary history, that Demosthenes\r\nspoke to a people of brutes;--to a barbarous people;--that there could\r\nhave been no civilisation before the invention of printing. Johnson\r\nwas a keen but a very narrow-minded observer of mankind. He perpetually\r\nconfounded their general nature with their particular circumstances. He\r\nknew London intimately. The sagacity of his remarks on its society is\r\nperfectly astonishing. But Fleet-street was the world to him. He\r\nsaw that Londoners who did not read were profoundly ignorant; and\r\nhe inferred that a Greek, who had few or no books, must have been as\r\nuninformed as one of Mr. Thrale’s draymen.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be, on the contrary, every reason to believe that, in\r\ngeneral intelligence, the Athenian populace far surpassed the lower\r\norders of any community that has ever existed. It must be considered,\r\nthat to be a citizen was to be a legislator,--a soldier,--a judge,--one\r\nupon whose voice might depend the fate of the wealthiest tributary\r\nstate, of the most eminent public man. The lowest offices, both of\r\nagriculture {147}and of trade, were, in common, performed by slaves. The\r\ncommonwealth supplied its meanest members with the support of life, the\r\nopportunity of leisure, and the means of amusement. Books were indeed\r\nfew: but they were excellent; and they were accurately known. It is\r\nnot by turning over libraries, but by repeatedly perusing and intently\r\ncontemplating a few great models, that the mind is best disciplined. A\r\nman of letters must now read much that he soon forgets, and much from\r\nwhich he learns nothing worthy to be remembered. The best works employ,\r\nin general, but a small portion of his time. Demosthenes is said to have\r\ntranscribed six times the history of Thucydides. If he had been a young\r\npolitician of the present age, he might in the same space of time have\r\nskimmed innumerable newspapers and pamphlets. I do not condemn that\r\ndesultory mode of study which the state of things, in our day, renders\r\na matter of necessity. But I may be allowed to doubt whether the changes\r\non which the admirers of modern institutions delight to dwell have\r\nimproved our condition so much in reality as in appearance. Rumford,\r\nit is said, proposed to the elector of Bavaria a scheme for feeding his\r\nsoldiers at a much cheaper rate than formerly. His plan was simply to\r\ncompel them to masticate their food thoroughly. A small quantity, thus\r\neaten, would, according to that famous projector, afford more sustenance\r\nthan a large meal hastily devoured. I do not know how Rumford’s\r\nproposition was received; but to the mind, I believe, it will be found\r\nmore nutritious to digest a page than to devour a volume.\r\n\r\nBooks, however, were the least part of the education of an Athenian\r\ncitizen. Let us, for a moment, transport ourselves, in thought, to that\r\nglorious city. Let {148}us imagine that we are entering its gates, in\r\nthe time of its power and glory. A crowd is assembled round a portico.\r\nAll are gazing with delight at the entablature; for Phidias is putting\r\nup the frieze. We turn into another street; a rhapsodist is reciting\r\nthere: men, women, children are thronging round him: the tears are\r\nrunning down their cheeks: their eyes are fixed: their very breath is\r\nstill; for he is telling how Priam fell at the feet of Achilles, and\r\nkissed those hands,--the terrible,--the murderous,--which had slain\r\nso many of his sons. (1) We enter the public place; there is a ring\r\nof youths, all leaning forward, with sparkling eyes, and gestures of\r\nexpectation. Socrates is pitted against the famous atheist, from\r\nIonia, and has just brought him to a contradiction in terms. But we are\r\ninterrupted. The herald is crying--“Room for the Prytanes.” The\r\ngeneral assembly is to meet. The people are swarming in on every side.\r\nProclamation is made--“Who wishes to speak.” There is a shout, and a\r\nclapping of hands; Pericles is mounting the stand. Then for a play of\r\nSophocles; and away to sup with Aspasia. I know of no modern university\r\nwhich has so excellent a system of education.\r\n\r\nKnowledge thus acquired and opinions thus formed were, indeed, likely\r\nto be, in some respects, defective. Propositions which are advanced\r\nin discourse generally result from a partial view of the question, and\r\ncannot be kept under examination long enough to be corrected. Men of\r\ngreat conversational powers almost universally practise a sort of\r\nlively sophistry and exaggeration, which deceives, for the moment, both\r\nthemselves {149}and their auditors. Thus we see doctrines, which cannot\r\nbear a close inspection, triumph perpetually in drawing-rooms, in\r\ndebating societies, and even in legislative or judicial assemblies. To\r\nthe conversational education of the Athenians I am inclined to attribute\r\nthe great looseness of reasoning which is remarkable in most of their\r\nscientific writings. Even the most illogical of modern writers would\r\nstand perfectly aghast at the puerile fallacies which seem to have\r\ndeluded some of the greatest men of antiquity. Sir Thomas Lethbridge\r\nwould stare at the political economy of Xenophon; and the author of\r\n_Soirées de Pétersbourg_ would be ashamed of some of the metaphysical\r\narguments of Plato. But the very circumstances which retarded the growth\r\nof science were peculiarly favourable to the cultivation of eloquence.\r\nFrom the early habit of taking a share in animated discussion the\r\nintelligent student would derive that readiness of resource, that\r\ncopiousness of language, and that knowledge of the temper and\r\nunderstanding of an audience, which are far more valuable to an orator\r\nthan the greatest logical powers.\r\n\r\nHorace has prettily compared poems to those paintings of which the\r\neffect varies as the spectator changes his stand. The same remark\r\napplies with at least equal justice to speeches. They must be read\r\nwith the temper of those to whom they were addressed, or they must\r\nnecessarily appear to offend against the laws of taste and reason; as\r\nthe finest picture, seen in a light different from that for which it was\r\ndesigned, will appear fit only for a sign. This is perpetually forgotten\r\nby those who criticise oratory. Because they are reading at leisure,\r\npausing at every line, reconsidering every argument, they forget that\r\n{150}the hearers were hurried from point to point too rapidly to detect\r\nthe fallacies through which they were conducted; that they had no time\r\nto disentangle sophisms, or to notice slight inaccuracies of expression;\r\nthat elaborate excellence, either of reasoning or of language, would\r\nhave been absolutely thrown away. To recur to the analogy of the sister\r\nart, these connoisseurs examine a panorama through a microscope, and\r\nquarrel with a scene-painter because he does not give to his work the\r\nexquisite finish of Gerard Dow.\r\n\r\nOratory is to be estimated on principles different from those which\r\nare applied to other productions. Truth is the object of philosophy and\r\nhistory. Truth is the object even of those works which are peculiarly\r\ncalled works of fiction, but which, in fact, bear the same relation to\r\nhistory which algebra bears to arithmetic. The merit of poetry, in\r\nits wildest forms, still consists in its truth,--truth conveyed to the\r\nunderstanding, not directly by the words, but circuitously by means of\r\nimaginative associations, which serve as its conductors. The object\r\nof oratory alone is not truth, but persuasion. The admiration of the\r\nmultitude does not make Moore a greater poet, than Coleridge, or Beattie\r\na greater philosoper than Berkeley. But the criterion of eloquence is\r\ndifferent. A speaker who exhausts the whole philosophy of a question,\r\nwho displays every grace of style, yet produces no effect on his\r\naudience, may be a great essayist, a great statesman, a great master of\r\ncomposition; but he is not an orator. If he miss the mark, it makes no\r\ndifference whether he have taken aim too high or too low.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the great freedom of the press in England has been, in a\r\ngreat measure, to destroy this distinction, {151}and to leave among us\r\nlittle of what I call Oratory Proper. Our legislators, our candidates,\r\non great occasions even our advocates, address themselves less to the\r\naudience than to the reporters. They think less of the few hearers than\r\nof the innumerable readers. At Athens the case was different; there the\r\nonly object of the speaker was immediate conviction and persuasion. He,\r\ntherefore, who would justly appreciate the merit of the Grecian orators\r\nshould place himself, as nearly as possible, in the situation of\r\ntheir auditors: he should divest himself of his modern feelings and\r\nacquirements, and make the prejudices and interests of the Athenian\r\ncitizen his own. He who studies their works in this spirit will find\r\nthat many of those things which, to an English reader, appear to be\r\nblemishes,--the frequent violation of those excellent rules of\r\nevidence by which our courts of law are regulated,--the introduction\r\nof extraneous matter,--the reference to considerations of political\r\nexpediency in judicial investigations,--the assertions, without\r\nproof,--the passionate entreaties,--the furious invectives,--are really\r\nproofs of the prudence and address of the speakers. He must not\r\ndwell maliciously on arguments or phrases, but acquiesce in his first\r\nimpressions. It requires repeated perusal and reflection to decide\r\nrightly on any other portion of literature. But with respect to works\r\nof which the merit depends on their instantaneous effect the most hasty\r\njudgment is likely to be best.\r\n\r\nThe history of eloquence at Athens is remarkable. From a very early\r\nperiod great speakers had flourished there. Pisistratus and Themistocles\r\nare said to have owed much of their influence to their talents for\r\ndebate. We learn, with more certainty, that Pericles was distinguished\r\nby extraordinary oratorical powers. {152}The substance of some of his\r\nspeeches is transmitted to us by Thucydides; and that excellent writer\r\nhas doubtless faithfully reported the general line of his arguments. But\r\nthe manner, which in oratory is of at least as much consequence as the\r\nmatter, was of no importance to his narration. It is evident that he has\r\nnot attempted to preserve it. Throughout his work, every speech on every\r\nsubject, whatever may have been the character or the dialect of the\r\nspeaker, is in exactly the same form. The grave king of Sparta, the\r\nfurious demagogue of Athens, the general encouraging his army, the\r\ncaptive supplicating for his life, all are represented as speakers\r\nin one unvaried style,--a style moreover wholly unfit for oratorical\r\npurposes. His mode of reasoning is singularly elliptical,--in reality\r\nmost consecutive,--yet in appearance often incoherent. His meaning, in\r\nitself sufficiently perplexing, is compressed into the fewest possible\r\nwords. His great fondness for antithetical expression has not a little\r\nconduced to’ this effect. Every one must have observed how much more the\r\nsense is condensed in the verses of Pope and his imitators, who never\r\nventured to continue the same clause from couplet to couplet, than\r\nin those of poets who allow themselves that license. Every artificial\r\ndivision, which is strongly marked, and which frequently recurs, has\r\nthe same tendency. The natural and perspicuous expression which\r\nspontaneously rises to the mind will often refuse to accommodate itself\r\nto such a form. It is necessary either to expand it into weakness, or\r\nto compress it into almost impenetrable density. The latter is generally\r\nthe choice of an able man, and was assuredly the choice of Thucydides.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that such speeches could never have been\r\ndelivered. They are perhaps {153}among the most difficult passages\r\nin the Greek language, and would probably have been scarcely more\r\nintelligible to an Athenian auditor than to a modern reader. Their\r\nobscurity was acknowledged by Cicero, who was as intimate with the\r\nliterature and language of Greece as the most accomplished of its\r\nnatives, and who seems to have held a respectable rank among the Greek\r\nauthors. Their difficulty to a modern reader lies, not in the words, but\r\nin the reasoning. A dictionary is of far less use in studying them than\r\na clear head and a close attention to the context. They are valuable\r\nto the scholar as displaying, beyond almost any other compositions, the\r\npowers of the finest of languages: they are valuable to the philosopher\r\nas illustrating the morals and manners of a most interesting age: they\r\nabound in just thought and energetic expression. But they do not\r\nenable us to form any accurate opinion on the merits of the early Greek\r\norators.\r\n\r\nThough it cannot be doubted that, before the Persian wars, Athens had\r\nproduced eminent speakers, yet the period during which eloquence most\r\nflourished among her citizens was by no means that of her greatest power\r\nand glory. It commenced at the close of the Peloponnesian war. In\r\nfact, the steps by which Athenian oratory approached to its finished\r\nexcellence seem to have been almost contemporaneous with those by which\r\nthe Athenian character and the Athenian empire sunk to degradation. At\r\nthe time when the little commonwealth achieved those victories which\r\ntwenty-five eventful centuries have left unequalled, eloquence was\r\nin its infancy. The deliverers of Greece became its plunderers and\r\noppressors. Unmeasured exaction, atrocious vengeance, the madness of\r\nthe multitude, the tyranny {154}of the great, filled the Cyclades with\r\ntears, and blood, and mourning. The sword unpeopled whole islands in\r\na day. The plough passed over the ruins of famous cities. The imperial\r\nrepublic sent forth her children by thousands to pine in the quarries\r\nof Syracuse, or to feed the vultures of Ægospotami. She was at length\r\nreduced by famine and slaughter to humble herself before her enemies,\r\nand to purchase existence by the sacrifice of her empire and her laws.\r\nDuring these disastrous and gloomy years, oratory was advancing towards\r\nits highest excellence. And it was when the moral, the political, and\r\nthe military character of the people was most utterly degraded, it was\r\nwhen the viceroy of a Macedonian sovereign gave law to Greece, that the\r\ncourts of Athens witnessed the most splendid contest of eloquence that\r\nthe world has ever known.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this phenomenon it is not, I think, difficult to assign.\r\nThe division of labour operates on the productions of the orator as it\r\ndoes on those of the mechanic. It was remarked by the ancients that the\r\nPentathlete, who divided his attention between several exercises, though\r\nhe could not vie with a boxer in the use of the cestus, or with one who\r\nhad confined his attention to running in the contest of the stadium,\r\nyet enjoyed far greater general vigour and health than either. It is\r\nthe same with the mind. The superiority in technical skill is often more\r\nthan compensated by the inferiority in general intelligence. And this is\r\npeculiarly the case in politics. States have always been best governed\r\nby men who have taken a wide view of public affairs, and who have rather\r\na general acquaintance with many sciences than a perfect mastery of\r\none. The union of the political and military departments in Greece\r\ncontributed not a little to the splendour of its {155}early history.\r\nAfter their separation more skilful generals and greater speakers\r\nappeared; but the breed of statesmen dwindled and became almost extinct.\r\nThemistocles or Pericles would have been no match for Demosthenes in\r\nthe assembly, or for Iphicrates in the field. But surely they were\r\nincomparably better fitted than either for the supreme direction of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed a remarkable coincidence between the progress of the\r\nart of war, and that of the art of oratory, among the Greeks. They\r\nboth advanced to perfection by contemporaneous steps, and from similar\r\ncauses. The early speakers, like the early warriors of Greece, were\r\nmerely a militia. It was found that in both employments practice and\r\ndiscipline gave superiority. (1) Each pursuit therefore became first an\r\nart, and then a trade. In proportion as the professors of each became\r\nmore expert in their particular craft, they became less respectable in\r\ntheir general character.\r\n\r\n     (1) It has often occurred to me, that to the circumstances\r\n     mentioned in the text is to be referred one of the most\r\n     remarkable events in Grecian history; I mean the silent but\r\n     rapid downfall of the Lacedæmonian power. Soon after the\r\n     termination of the Peloponnesian war, the strength of\r\n     Lacedaemon began to decline. Its military discipline, its\r\n     social institutions, were the same. Agesilaus, during whose\r\n     reign the change took place, was the ablest of its kings.\r\n     Yet the Spartan armies were frequently defeated in pitched\r\n     battles,--an occurrence considered impossible in the earlier\r\n     ages of Greece. They are allowed to have fought most\r\n     bravely; yet they were no longer attended by the success to\r\n     which they had formerly been accustomed. No solution of\r\n     these circumstances is offered, as far as I know, by any\r\n     ancient author. The real cause, I conceive, was this. The\r\n     Lacedæmonians, alone among the Greeks, formed a permanent\r\n     standing army. While the citizens of other commonwealths\r\n     were engaged in agriculture and trade, they had no\r\n     employment whatever but the study of military discipline.\r\n     Hence, during the Persian and Peloponnesian wars, they had\r\n     that advantage over their neighbours which regular troops\r\n     always possess over militia. This advantage they lost, when\r\n     other states began, at a later period, to employ mercenary\r\n     forces, who were probably as superior to them in the art of\r\n     war as they had hitherto been to their antagonists.\r\n     {156}Their skill had been obtained at too great expense to\r\n     be employed only from disinterested views. Thus, the\r\n     soldiers forgot that they were citizens, and the orators\r\n     that they were statesmen. I know not to what Demosthenes and\r\n     his famous contemporaries can be so justly compared as to\r\n     those mercenary troops who, in their time, overran Greece;\r\n     or those who, from similar causes, were some centuries ago\r\n     the scourge of the Italian republics,--perfectly acquainted\r\n     with every part of their profession, irresistible in the\r\n     field, powerful to defend or to destroy, but defending\r\n     without love, and destroying without hatred. We may despise\r\n     the characters of these political _Condottieri_; but it is\r\n     impossible to examine the system of their tactics without\r\n     being amazed at its perfection.\r\n\r\nI had intended to proceed to this examination, and to consider\r\nseparately the remains of Lysias, of Æschines, of Demosthenes, and of\r\nIsocrates, who, though strictly speaking he was rather a pamphleteer\r\nthan an orator, deserves, on many accounts, a place in such a\r\ndisquisition. The length of my prolegomena and digressions compels me\r\nto postpone this part of the subject to another occasion. A Magazine is\r\ncertainly a delightful invention for a very idle or a very busy man. He\r\nis not compelled to complete his plan or to adhere to his subject. He\r\nmay ramble as far as lie is inclined, and stop as soon as he is tired.\r\nNo one takes the trouble to recollect his contradictory opinions or his\r\nunredeemed pledges. He may be as superficial, as inconsistent, and as\r\ncareless as he chooses. Magazines resemble those little angels, who,\r\naccording to the pretty Rabbinical tradition, are generated every\r\nmorning by the brook which rolls over the flowers of Paradise,--whose\r\nlife is a song,--who {157}warble till sunset, and then sink back without\r\nregret into nothingness. Such spirits have nothing to do with the\r\ndetecting spear of Ithuriel or the victorious sword of Michael. It is\r\nenough for them to please and be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROPHETIC ACCOUNT OF A GRAND NATIONAL EPIC POEM, TO BE ENTITLED “THE\r\nWELLINGTONIAD,” AND TO BE PUBLISHED A.D. 2824.\r\n\r\n\r\n{158}(_Knight’s Quarterly Magazine_, November 1824.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow I became a prophet it is not very important to the reader to know.\r\nNevertheless I feel all the anxiety which, under similar circumstances,\r\ntroubled the sensitive mind of Sidrophel; and, like him, am eager to\r\nvindicate myself from the suspicion of having practised forbidden arts,\r\nor held intercourse with beings of another world. I solemnly declare,\r\ntherefore, that I never saw a ghost, like Lord Lyttleton; consulted a\r\ngypsy, like Josephine; or heard my name pronounced by an absent person,\r\nlike Dr. Johnson. Though it is now almost as usual for gentlemen to\r\nappear at the moment of their death to their friends as to call on them\r\nduring their life, none of my acquaintance have been so polite as to pay\r\nme that customary attention. I have derived my knowledge neither from\r\nthe dead nor from the living; neither from the lines of a hand, nor from\r\nthe grounds of a tea-cup; neither from the stars of the firmament, nor\r\nfrom the fiends of the abyss. I have never, like the Wesley family,\r\nheard “that mighty leading angel,” who “drew after him the third part\r\nof heaven’s sons,” {159}scratching in my cupboard. I have never been\r\nenticed to sign any of those delusive bonds which have been the ruin of\r\nso many poor creatures; and, having always been an indifferent horseman,\r\nI have been careful not to venture myself on a broomstick.\r\n\r\nMy insight into futurity, like that of George Fox the quaker, and that\r\nof our great and philosophic poet, Lord Byron, is derived from simple\r\npresentiment. This is a far less artificial process than those which are\r\nemployed by some others. Yet my predictions will, I believe, be found\r\nmore correct than their’s, or, at all events, as Sir Benjamin Backbite\r\nsays in the play, “more circumstantial.”\r\n\r\nI prophecy, then, that, in the year 2824, according to our present\r\nreckoning, a grand national Epic Poem, worthy to be compared with the\r\nIliad, the Æneid, or the Jerusalem, will be published in London.\r\n\r\nMen naturally take an interest in the adventures of every eminent\r\nwriter. I will, therefore, gratify the laudable curiosity, which, on\r\nthis occasion, will doubtless be universal, by prefixing to my account\r\nof the poem a concise memoir of the poet.\r\n\r\nRichard Quongti will be born at Westminster on the 1st of July, 2786.\r\nHe will be the younger son of the younger branch of one of the most\r\nrespectable families in England. He will be lineally descended from\r\nQuongti, the famous Chinese liberal, who, after the failure of the\r\nheroic attempt of his party to obtain a constitution from the Emperor\r\nFim Fam, will take refuge in England, in the twenty-third century. Here\r\nhis descendants will obtain considerable note; and one branch of the\r\nfamily will be raised to the peerage.\r\n\r\nRichard, however, though destined to exalt his family to distinction far\r\nnobler than any which wealth or {160}titles can bestow, will be born to\r\na very scanty fortune He will display in his early youth such striking\r\ntalents as will attract the notice of Viscount Quongti, his third\r\ncousin, then secretary of state for the Steam Department. At the expense\r\nof this eminent nobleman, he will be sent to prosecute his studies at\r\nthe university of Tombuctoo. To that illustrious seat of the muses all\r\nthe ingenuous youth of every country will then be attracted by the high\r\nscientific character of Professor Quashaboo, and the eminent literary\r\nattainments of Professor Kissey Kickey. In spite of this formidable\r\ncompetition, however, Quongti will acquire the highest honours in every\r\ndepartment of knowledge, and will obtain the esteem of his associates by\r\nhis amiable and unaffected manners. The guardians of the young Duke of\r\nCarrington, premier peer of England, and the last remaining scion of the\r\nancient and illustrious house of Smith, will be desirous to secure so\r\nable an instructor for their ward. With the Duke, Quongti will perform\r\nthe grand tour, and visit the polished courts of Sydney and Capetown.\r\nAfter prevailing on his pupil, with great difficulty, to subdue a violent\r\nand imprudent passion which he had conceived for a Hottentot lady, of\r\ngreat beauty and accomplishments indeed, but of dubious character,\r\nhe will travel with him to the United States of America. But that\r\ntremendous war which will be fatal to American liberty will at that time\r\nbe raging through the whole federation. At New York the travellers\r\nwill hear of the final defeat and death of the illustrious champion\r\nof freedom, Jonathan Hioffinbottom, and of the elevation of Ebenezer\r\nHogsflesh to the perpetual Presidency. They will not choose to proceed\r\nin a journey which would expose {161}them to the insults of that brutal\r\nsoldiery, whose cruelty and rapacity will have devastated Mexico and\r\nColombia, and now, at length, enslaved their own country.\r\n\r\nOn their return to England, a.d. 2810, the death of the Duke will compel\r\nhis preceptor to seek for a subsistence by literary labours. His fame\r\nwill be raised by many small productions of considerable merit; and he\r\nwill at last obtain a permanent place in the highest class of writers by\r\nhis great epic poem.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated work will become, with unexampled rapidity, a popular\r\nfavourite. The sale will be so beneficial to the author that, instead of\r\ngoing; about the dirty streets on his velocipede, he will be enabled to\r\nset up his balloon.\r\n\r\nThe character of this noble poem will be so finely and justly given\r\nin the Tombuctoo Review for April, 2825, that I cannot refrain from\r\ntranslating the passage. The author will be our poet’s old preceptor,\r\nProfessor Kissey Kickey.\r\n\r\n“In pathos, in splendour of language, in sweetness of versification, Mr.\r\nQuongti has long been considered as unrivalled. In his exquisite poem on\r\nthe _Omithorynchus Paradoxus_ all these qualities are displayed in their\r\ngreatest perfection. How exquisitely does that work arrest and embody\r\nthe undefined and vague shadows which flit over an imaginative mind. The\r\ncold worldling may not comprehend it; but it will find a response in the\r\nbosom of every youthful poet, of every enthusiastic lover who has seen\r\nan Ornithorynchus Paradoxus by moonlight. But we were yet to learn that\r\nhe possessed the comprehension, the judgment, and the fertility of mind\r\nindispensable to the epic poet.\r\n\r\n“It is difficult to conceive a plot more perfect than that of the\r\n‘Wellingtoniad.’ It is most faithful to the {162}manners of the age to\r\nwhich it relates. It preserves exactly all the historical circumstances,\r\nand interweaves them most artfully with all the _speciosa miracula_ of\r\nsupernatural agency.”\r\n\r\nThus far the learned Professor of Humanity in the university of\r\nTombuctoo. I fear that the critics of our time will form an opinion\r\ndiametrically opposite as to these very points. Some will, I fear,\r\nbe disgusted by the machinery, which is derived from the mythology of\r\nancient Greece. I can only say that in the twenty-ninth century, that\r\nmachinery will be universally in use among poets; and that Quongti will\r\nuse it, partly in conformity with the general practice, and partly from\r\na veneration, perhaps excessive, for the great remains of classical\r\nantiquity, which will then, as now, be assiduously read by every man of\r\neducation; though Tom Moore’s songs will be forgotten, and only three\r\ncopies of Lord Byron’s works will exist: one in the possession of King\r\nGeorge the Nineteenth, one in the Duke of Carrington’s collection,\r\nand one in the library of the British Museum. Finally, should any good\r\npeople be concerned to hear that Pagan fictions will so long retain\r\ntheir influence over literature, let them reflect that, as the Bishop\r\nof St. David’s says, in his “Proofs of the Inspiration of the Sibylline\r\nVerses,” read at the last meeting of the Royal Society of Literature,\r\n“at all events, a Pagan is not a Papist.”\r\n\r\nSome readers of the present day may think that Quongti is by no means\r\nentitled to the compliments which his Negro critic pays him on his\r\nadherence to the historical circumstances of the time in which he has\r\nchosen his subject; that, where he introduces any trait of our manners,\r\nit is in the wrong place, and that he confounds the customs of our age\r\nwith those of {163}much more remote periods. I can only say that the\r\ncharge is infinitely more applicable to Homer, Virgil, and Tasso. If,\r\ntherefore, the reader should detect, in the following abstract of the\r\nplot, any little deviation from strict historical accuracy, let him\r\nreflect, for a moment, whether Agamemnon would not have found as much to\r\ncensure in the Iliad,--Dido in the Æneid,--or Godfrey in the Jerusalem.\r\nLet him not suffer his opinions to depend on circumstances which cannot\r\npossibly affect the truth or falsehood of the representation. If it\r\nbe impossible for a single man to kill hundreds in battle, the\r\nimpossibility is not diminished by distance of time. If it be as certain\r\nthat Rinaldo never disenchanted a forest in Palestine as it is that the\r\nDuke of Wellington never disenchanted the forest of Soignies, can we, as\r\nrational men, tolerate the one story and ridicule the other? Of this, at\r\nleast, I am certain, that whatever excuse we have for admiring the plots\r\nof those famous poems our children will have for extolling that of the\r\n“Wellingtoniad.”\r\n\r\nI shall proceed to give a sketch of the narrative. The subject is “The\r\nReign of the Hundred Days.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nThe poem commences, in form, with a solemn proposition of the subject.\r\nThen the muse is invoked to give the poet accurate information as to the\r\ncauses of so terrible a commotion. The answer to this question, being,\r\nit is to be supposed, the joint production of the poet and the muse,\r\nascribes the event to circumstances which have hitherto eluded all the\r\nresearch of political writers, namely, the influence of the god Mars,\r\nwho, we are told had some forty years before usurped the {164}conjugal\r\nrights of old Carlo Buonaparte, and given birth to Napoleon. By his\r\nincitement it was that the emperor with his devoted companions was\r\nnow on the sea, returning to his ancient dominions. The gods were at\r\npresent, fortunately for the adventurer, feasting with the Ethiopians,\r\nwhose entertainments, according to the ancient custom described by\r\nHomer, they annually attended, with the same sort of condescending\r\ngluttony which now carries the cabinet to Guildhall on the 9th of\r\nNovember. Neptune, was, in consequence, absent, and unable to prevent\r\nthe enemy of his favourite island from crossing his element. Boreas,\r\nhowever, who had his abode on the banks of the Russian ocean, and who,\r\nlike Thetis in the Iliad, was not of sufficient quality to have an\r\ninvitation to Ethiopia, resolves to destroy the armament which brings\r\nwar and danger to his beloved Alexander. He accordingly raises a storm\r\nwhich is most powerfully described. Napoleon bewails the inglorious fate\r\nfor which he seems to be reserved. “Oh! thrice happy,” says he, “those\r\nwho were frozen to death at Krasnoi, or slaughtered at Leipzic. Oh,\r\nKutusoff, bravest of the Russians, wherefore was I not permitted to fall\r\nby thy victorious sword?” He then offers a prayer to Æolus, and vows\r\nto him a sacrifice of a black ram. In consequence, the god recalls his\r\nturbulent subject; the sea is calmed; and the ship anchors in the port\r\nof Frejus. Napoleon and Bertrand, who is always called the faithful\r\nBertrand, land to explore the country; Mars meets them disguised as\r\na lancer of the guard, wearing the cross of the legion of honour. He\r\nadvises them to apply for necessaries of all kinds to the governor,\r\nshows them the way, and disappears with a strong smell of gunpowder.\r\nNapoleon makes a pathetic {165}speech, and enters the governor’s house.\r\nHere he sees hanging up a fine print of the battle of Austerlitz,\r\nhimself in the foreground giving his orders. This puts him in high\r\nspirits; he advances and salutes the governor, who receives him most\r\nloyally, gives him an entertainment, and, according to the usage of all\r\nepic hosts, insists after dinner on a full narration of all that has\r\nhappened to him since the battle of Leipzic.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nNapoleon carries his narrative from the battle of Leipsic to his\r\nabdication. But, as we shall have a great quantity of fighting on our\r\nhands, I think it best to omit the details.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nNapoleon describes his sojourn at Elba, and his return; how he was\r\ndriven by stress of weather to Sardinia, and fought with the harpies\r\nthere; how he was then carried southward to Sicily, where he generously\r\ntook on board an English sailor, whom a man of war had unhappily left\r\nthere, and who was in imminent danger of being devoured by the Cyclops;\r\nhow he landed in the bay of Naples, saw the Sibyl, and descended to\r\nTartarus; how he held a long and pathetic conversation with Poniatowski,\r\nwhom he found wandering unburied on the banks of Styx; how he swore to\r\ngive him a splendid funeral; how he had also an affectionate interview\r\nwith Desaix; how Moreau and Sir Ralph Abercrombie fled at the sight\r\nof him. He relates that he then re-embarked, and met with nothing of\r\nimportance till the commencement of the storm with which the poem opens.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\nThe {166}scene changes to Paris. Fame, in the garb of an express,\r\nbrings intelligence of the landing of Napoleon. The king performs a\r\nsacrifice: but the entrails are unfavourable; and the victim is without\r\na heart. He prepares to encounter the invader. A young captain of\r\nthe guard,--the son of Marie Antoinette by Apollo,--in the shape of a\r\nfiddler, rushes in to tell him that Napoleon is approaching with a vast\r\narmy. The royal forces are drawn out for battle. Full catalogues\r\nare given of the regiments on both sides: their colonels,\r\nlieutenant-colonels, and uniform.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\nThe king comes forward and defies Napoleon to single combat. Napoleon\r\naccepts it. Sacrifices are offered. The ground is measured by Ney and\r\nMacdonald. The combatants advance. Louis snaps his pistol in vain. The\r\nbullet of Napoleon, on the contrary, cax-ries off the tip of the king’s\r\near. Napoleon then rushes on him sword in hand. But Louis snatches up a\r\nstone, such as ten men of those degenerate days will be unable to move,\r\nand hurls it at his antagonist. Mars averts it. Napoleon then seizes\r\nLouis, and is about to strike a fatal blow, when Bacchus intervenes,\r\nlike Venus in the third book of the Iliad, bears off the king in a thick\r\ncloud, and seats him in an hotel at Lille, with a bottle of Maraschino\r\nand a basin of soup before him. Both armies instantly proclaim Napoleon\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI.\r\n\r\nNeptune, {167}returned from his Ethiopian revels, sees with rage the\r\nevents which have taken place in Europe. He flies to the cave of Alecto,\r\nand drags out the fiend, commanding her to excite universal hostility\r\nagainst Napoleon. The Fury repairs to Lord Castlereagli; and, as,\r\nwhen she visited Tumus, she assumed the form of an old woman, she here\r\nappears in the kindred shape of Mr. Vansittart, and in an impassioned\r\naddress exhorts his lordship to war. His lordship, like Tumus, treats\r\nthis unwonted monitor with great disrespect, tells him that he is an old\r\ndoting fool, and advises him to look after the ways and means, and leave\r\nquestions of peace and war to his betters. The Fury then displays all\r\nher terrors. The neat powdered hair bristles up into snakes; the black\r\nstockings appear clotted with blood; and, brandishing a torch, she\r\nannounces her name and mission. Lord Castlereagh, seized with fury,\r\nflies instantly to the Parliament, and recommends war with a torrent\r\nof eloquent invective. All the members instantly clamour for vengeance,\r\nseize their arms which are hanging round the walls of the house, and\r\nrash forth to prepare for instant hostilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII.\r\n\r\nIn this book intelligence arrives at London of the flight of the\r\nDuchess d’Angoulême from France. It is stated that this heroine, armed\r\nfrom head to foot, defended Bordeaux against the adherents of Napoleon,\r\nand that she fought hand to hand with Clausel, and beat him down with\r\nan enormous stone. Deserted by her followers, she at last, like Tumus,\r\nplunged, armed {168}as she was, into the Garonne, and swam to an English\r\nship which lay off the coast. This intelligence yet more inflames the\r\nEnglish to war.\r\n\r\nA yet holder flight than any which has been mentioned follows. The Duke\r\nof Wellington goes to take leave of the duchess; and a scene passes\r\nquite equal to the famous interview of Hector and Andromache. Lord Douro\r\nis frightened at his father’s feather, but begs for his epaulette.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.\r\n\r\nNeptune, trembling for the event of the war, implores Venus, who, as\r\nthe offspring of his element, naturally venerates him, to procure from\r\nVulcan a deadly sword and a pair of unerring pistols for the duke. They\r\nare accordingly made, and superbly decorated. The sheath of the sword,\r\nlike the shield of Achilles, is carved, in exquisitely fine miniature,\r\nwith scenes from the common life of the period; a dance at Almack’s, a\r\nboxing match at the Fives-court, a lord mayor’s procession, and a man\r\nhanging. All these are fully and elegantly described. The Duke thus\r\narmed hastens to Brussels.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX.\r\n\r\nThe Duke is received at Brussels by the King of the Netherlands with\r\ngreat magnificence. He is informed of the approach of the armies of all\r\nthe confederate kings. The poet, however, with a laudable zeal for\r\nthe glory of his country, completely passes over the exploits of the\r\nAustrians in Italy, and the discussions of the congress. England\r\nand France, Wellington and Napoleon, almost exclusively occupy his\r\n{169}attention. Several days are spent at Brussels in revelry. The\r\nEnglish heroes astonish their allies by exhibiting splendid games,\r\nsimilar to those which draw the flower of the British aristocracy\r\nto Newmarket and Moulsey Hurst, and which will be considered by our\r\ndescendants with as much veneration as the Olympian and Isthmian\r\ncontests by classical students of the present time. In the combat of the\r\ncestus, Shaw, the life-guardsman, vanquishes the Prince of Orange, and\r\nobtains a bull as a prize. In the horse-race, the Duke of Wellington and\r\nLord Uxbridge ride against each other; the Duke is victorious, and is\r\nrewarded with twelve opera-girls. On the last day of the festivities, a\r\nsplendid dance takes place, at which all the heroes attend.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK X.\r\n\r\nMars, seeing the English army thus inactive, hastens to rouse Napoleon,\r\nwho, conducted by Night and Silence, unexpectedly attacks the Prussians.\r\nThe slaughter is immense. Napoleon kills many whose histories and\r\nfamilies are happily particularised. He slays Herman, the craniologist,\r\nwho dwelt by the linden-shadowed Elbe, and measured with his eye the\r\nskulls of all who walked through the streets of Berlin. Alas! his own\r\nskull is now cleft by the Corsican sword. Four pupils of the University\r\nof Jena advance together to encounter the Emperor; at four blows he\r\ndestroys them all. Blucher rushes to arrest the devastation; Napoleon\r\nstrikes him to the ground, and is on the point of killing him, but\r\nGneisenau, Ziethen, Billow, and all the other heroes of the Prussian\r\narmy, gather round him, and bear the venerable chief to a distance from\r\nthe field. The slaughter is continued till night. In {170}the meantime\r\nNeptune has despatched Fame to bear the intelligence to the Duke, who\r\nis dancing at Brussels. The whole army is put in motion. The Duke of\r\nBrunswick’s horse speaks to admonish him of his danger, but in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XI.\r\n\r\nPicton, the Duke of Brunswick, and the Prince of Orange, engage Ney at\r\nQuatre Bras. Ney kills the Duke of Brunswick, and strips him, sending\r\nhis belt to Napoleon. The English fall back on Waterloo. Jupiter calls\r\na council of the gods, and commands that none shall interfere on either\r\nside. Mars and Neptune make very eloquent speeches. The battle of\r\nWaterloo commences. Napoleon kills Picton and Delaney. Ney engages\r\nPonsonby and kills him. The Prince of Orange is wounded by Soult. Lord\r\nUxbridge flies to check the carnage. He is severely wounded by Napoleon,\r\nand only saved by the assistance of Lord Hill. In the mean time the\r\nDuke makes a tremendous carnage among the French. He encounters General\r\nDuhesme and vanquishes him, but spares his life. He kills Toubert, who\r\nkept the gaming-house in the Palais Royal, and Maronet, who loved to\r\nspend whole nights in drinking champagne. Clerval, who had been hooted\r\nfrom the stage, and had then become a captain in the Imperial Guard,\r\nwished that he had still continued to face the more harmless enmity of\r\nthe Parisian pit. But Larrey, the son of Esculapius, whom his father had\r\ninstructed in all the secrets of his art, and who was surgeon-general of\r\nthe French army, embraced the knees of the destroyer, and conjured him\r\nnot to give death to one whose office it was to give life. The Duke\r\nraised him, and bade him live. {171}But we must hasten to the close.\r\nNapoleon rushes to encounter Wellington. Both armies stand in mute\r\namaze. The heroes fire their pistols; that of Napoleon misses, but that\r\nof Wellington, formed by the hand of Vulcan, and primed by the Cyclops,\r\nwounds the Emperor in the thigh. He flies, and takes refuge among his\r\ntroops. The flight becomes promiscuous. The arrival of the Prussians,\r\nfrom a motive of patriotism, the poet completely passes over.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XII.\r\n\r\nThings are now hastening to the catastrophe. Napoleon flies to London,\r\nand, seating himself on the hearth of the Regent, embraces the household\r\ngods, and conjures him, by the venerable age of George III., and by the\r\nopening perfections of the Princess Charlotte, to spare him. The Prince\r\nis inclined to do so; when, looking on his breast, he sees there the\r\nbelt of the Duke of Brunswick. He instantly draws his sword, and is\r\nabout to stab the destroyer of his kinsman. Piety and hospitality,\r\nhowever, restrain his hand. He takes a middle course, and condemns\r\nNapoleon to be exposed on a desert island. The King of France re-enters\r\nParis; and the poem concludes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON MITFORD’S HISTORY OF GREECE.\r\n\r\n{172}(_Knight’s Quarterly Magazine_, November 1824.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a book which enjoys a great and increasing popularity: but,\r\nwhile it has attracted a considerable share of the public attention, it\r\nhas been little noticed by the critics. Mr. Mitford has almost succeeded\r\nin mounting, unperceived by those whose office it is to watch such\r\naspirants, to a high place among historians. He has taken a seat on\r\nthe dais without being challenged by a single seneschal. To oppose the\r\nprogress of his fame is now almost a hopeless enterprise. Had he been\r\nreviewed with candid severity, when he had published only his first\r\nvolume, his work would either have deserved its reputation, or would\r\nnever have obtained it. “Then,” as Indra says of Kehama, “then was the\r\ntime to strike.” The time was neglected; and the consequence is that\r\nMr. Mitford, like Kehama, has laid his victorious hand on the literary\r\nAmreeta, and seems about to taste the precious elixir of immortality. I\r\nshall venture to emulate the courage of the honest Glendoveer--\r\n\r\n                             “When now\r\n\r\n               He saw the Amreeta in Kehama’s hand,\r\n\r\n               An impulse that defied all self-command,\r\n\r\n                        In that extremity,\r\n\r\n               Stung him, and he resolved to seize the cup,\r\n\r\n               And dare the Rajah’s force in Seeva’s sight.\r\n\r\n               Forward he sprung to tempt the unequal fray.\"\r\n\r\nIn plain words, I shall offer a few considerations, {173}which may tend\r\nto reduce an overpraised writer to his proper level.\r\n\r\nThe principal characteristic of this historian, the origin of his\r\nexcellencies and his defects, is a love of singularity. He has no\r\nnotion of going with a multitude to do either good or evil. An exploded\r\nopinion, or an unpopular person, has an irresistible charm for him. The\r\nsame perverseness may be traced in his diction. His style would\r\nnever have been elegant; but it might at least have been manly and\r\nperspicuous; and nothing but the most elaborate care could possibly have\r\nmade it so bad as it is. It is distinguished by harsh phrases, strange\r\ncollocations, occasional solecisms, frequent obscurity, and, above all,\r\nby a peculiar oddity, which can no more be described than it can be\r\noverlooked. Nor is this all. Mr. Mitford piques himself on spelling\r\nbetter than any of his neighbours; and this not only in ancient names,\r\nwhich he mangles in defiance both of custom and of reason, but in the\r\nmost ordinary words of the English language. It is, in itself, a matter\r\nperfectly indifferent whether we call a foreigner by the name which he\r\nbears in his own language, or by that which corresponds to it in ours;\r\nwhether we say Lorenzo de Medici, or Lawrence de Medici, Jean Chauvin,\r\nor John Calvin. In such cases established usage is considered as law\r\nby all writers except Mr. Mitford. If he were always consistent\r\nwith himself, he might be excused for sometimes disagreeing with his\r\nneighbours; but he proceeds on no principle but that of being unlike\r\nthe rest of the world. Every child has heard of Linnæus; therefore\r\nMr. Mitford calls him Linné: Rousseau is known all over Europe as Jean\r\nJacques; therefore Mr. Mitford bestows on him the strange appellation\r\nof John James. {174}Had Mr. Mitford undertaken a history of any other\r\ncountry than Greece, this propensity would have rendered his work\r\nuseless and absurd. His occasional remarks on the affairs of ancient\r\nRome and of modern Europe are full of errors: but he writes of times\r\nwith respect to which almost every other writer has been in the wrong;\r\nand, therefore, by resolutely deviating from his predecessors, he is\r\noften in the right.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the modern historians of Greece have shown the grossest\r\nignorance of the most obvious phenomena of human nature. In their\r\nrepresentations the generals and statesmen of antiquity are absolutely\r\ndivested of all individuality. They are personifications; they are\r\npassions, talents, opinions, virtues, vices, but not men. Inconsistency\r\nis a thing of which these writers have no notion. That a man may have\r\nbeen liberal in his youth and avaricious in his age, cruel to one enemy\r\nand merciful to another, is to them utterly inconceivable. If the facts\r\nbe undeniable, they suppose some, strange and deep design, in order to\r\nexplain what, as every one who has observed his own mind knows, needs\r\nno explanation at all. This is a mode of writing very acceptable to the\r\nmultitude who have always been accustomed to make gods and daemons\r\nout of men very little better or worse than themselves; but it appears\r\ncontemptible to all who have watched the changes of human character--to\r\nall who have observed the influence of time, of circumstances, and\r\nof associates, on mankind--to all who have seen a hero in the gout, a\r\ndemocrat in the church, a pedant in love, or a philosopher in liquor.\r\nThis practice of painting in nothing but black and white is unpardonable\r\neven in the drama. It is the great fault of Alfieri; {175}and how much\r\nit injures the effect of his compositions will be obvious to every one\r\nwho will compare his Rosmunda with the Lady Macbeth of Shakspeare. The\r\none is a wicked woman; the other is a fiend. Her only feeling is hatred;\r\nall her words are curses. We are at once shocked and fatigued by the\r\nspectacle of such raving cruelty, excited by no provocation, repeatedly\r\nchanging its object, and constant in nothing but in its inextinguishable\r\nthirst for blood.\r\n\r\nIn history this error is far more disgraceful. Indeed, there is no fault\r\nwhich so completely ruins a narrative in the opinion of a judicious\r\nreader. We know that the line of demarcation between good and bad men\r\nis so faintly marked as often to elude the most careful investigation\r\nof those who have the best opportunities for judging. Public men, above\r\nall, are surrounded with so many temptations and difficulties that\r\nsome doubt must almost always hang over their real dispositions and\r\nintentions. The lives of Pym, Cromwell, Monk, Clarendon, Marlborough,\r\nBurnet, Walpole, are well known to us. We are acquainted with their\r\nactions, their speeches, their writings; we have abundance of letters\r\nand well-authenticated anecdotes relating to them: yet what candid man\r\nwill venture very positively to say which of them were honest and which\r\nof them were dishonest men. It appears easier to pronounce decidedly\r\nupon the great characters of antiquity, not because we have greater\r\nmeans of discovering truth, but simply because we have less means of\r\ndetecting error. The modern historians of Greece have forgotten this.\r\nTheir heroes and villains are as consistent in all their sayings and\r\ndoings as the cardinal virtues and the deadly sins in an allegory. We\r\nshould as soon expect a good action from giant Slaygood {176}in Bunyan\r\nas from Dionysius; and a crime of Epaminondas would seem as incongruous\r\nas a _faux-pas_ of the grave and comely damsel, called Discretion, who\r\nanswered the bell at the door of the house Beautiful.\r\n\r\nThis error was partly the cause and partly the effect of the high\r\nestimation in which the later ancient writers have been held by modern\r\nscholars. Those French and English authors who have treated of the\r\naffairs of Greece have generally turned with contempt from the simple\r\nand natural narrations of Thucydides and Xenophon to the extravagant\r\nrepresentations of Plutarch, Diodorus, Curtius, and other romancers\r\nof the same class,--men who described military operations without ever\r\nhaving handled a sword, and applied to the seditions of little republics\r\nspeculations formed by observation on an empire which covered half\r\nthe known world. Of liberty they knew nothing. It was to them a\r\ngreat mystery,--a superhuman enjoyment. They ranted about liberty and\r\npatriotism, from the same cause which leads monks to talk more ardently\r\nthan other men about love and women. A wise man values political\r\nliberty, because it secures the persons and the possessions of citizens;\r\nbecause it tends to prevent the extravagance of rulers, and the\r\ncorruption of judges; because it gives birth to useful sciences and\r\nelegant arts; because it excites the industry and increases the comforts\r\nof all classes of society. These theorists imagined that it possessed\r\nsomething eternally and intrinsically good, distinct from the blessings\r\nwhich it generally produced. They considered it not as a means but as an\r\nend; an end to be attained at any cost. Their favourite heroes are\r\nthose who have sacrificed, for the mere name of freedom, the prosperity\r\n{177}--the security--the justice--from which freedom derives its value.\r\n\r\nThere is another remarkable characteristic of these writers, in which\r\ntheir modern worshippers have carefully imitated them,--a great fondness\r\nfor good stories. The most established facts, dates, and characters are\r\nnever suffered to come into competition with a splendid saying, or a\r\nromantic exploit. The early historians have left us natural and simple\r\ndescriptions of the great events which they witnessed, and the great men\r\nwith whom they associated. When we read the account which Plutarch\r\nand Rollin have given of the same period, we scarcely know our old\r\nacquaintance again; we are utterly confounded by the melo-dra-matic\r\neffect of the narration, and the sublime coxcombry of the characters. .\r\n\r\nThese are the principal errors into which the predecessors of Mr.\r\nMitford have fallen; and from most of these he is free. His faults\r\nare of a completely different description. It is to be hoped that the\r\nstudents of history may now be saved, like Dorax in Dryden’s play,\r\nby swallowing two conflicting poisons, each of which may serve as an\r\nantidote to the other.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important difference between Mr. Mitford and those\r\nwho have preceded him is in his narration. Here the advantage lies, for\r\nthe most part, on his side. His principle is to follow the contemporary\r\nhistorians, to look with doubt on all statements which are not in\r\nsome degree confirmed by them, and absolutely to reject all which are\r\ncontradicted by them. While he retains the guidance of some writer in\r\nwhom he can place confidence, he goes on excellently. When he loses it,\r\nhe falls to the level, or perhaps below the level, of the writers whom\r\nhe so much despises: he is {178}as absurd as they, and very much duller.\r\nIt is really amusing to observe how be proceeds with his narration when\r\nhe has no better authority than poor Diodorus. He is compelled to relate\r\nsomething; yet he believes nothing. He accompanies every fact with\r\na long statement of objections. His account of the administration of\r\nDionysius is in no sense a history. It ought to be entitled--“Historic\r\ndoubts as to certain events, alleged to have taken place in Sicily.”\r\n\r\nThis scepticism, however, like that of some great legal characters\r\nalmost as sceptical as himself, vanishes whenever his political\r\npartialities interfere. He is a vehement admirer of tyranny and\r\noligarchy, and considers no evidence as feeble which can be brought\r\nforward in favour of those forms of government. Democracy he hates with\r\na perfect hatred, a hatred which, in the first volume of his history,\r\nappears only in his episodes and reflections, but which, in those parts\r\nwhere he has less reverence for his guides, and can venture to take his\r\nown way, completely distorts even his narration.\r\n\r\nIn taking up these opinions, I have no doubt that Mr. Mitford was\r\ninfluenced by the same love of singularity which led him to spell\r\n_island_ without an s, and to place two dots over the last letter of\r\n_idea_. In truth, preceding historians have erred so monstrously on the\r\nother side that even the worst parts of Mr. Mitford’s book may be useful\r\nas a corrective. For a young gentleman who talks much about his country,\r\ntyrannicide, and Epaminondas, this work, diluted in a sufficient\r\nquantity of Rollin and Barthelemi, maybe a very useful remedy.\r\n\r\nThe errors of both parties arise from an ignorance or a neglect of the\r\nfundamental principles of political science. The writers on one side\r\nimagine popular government {170}to be always a blessing; Mr. Mitford\r\nomits no opportunity of assuring us that it is always a curse. The fact\r\nis, that a good government, like a good coat, is that which fits the\r\nbody for which it is designed, A man who, upon abstract principles,\r\npronounces a constitution to be good, without an exact knowledge of the\r\npeople who are to be governed by it, judges as absurdly as a tailor\r\nwho should measime the Belvidere Apollo for the clothes of all his\r\ncustomers. The demagogues who wished to see Portugal a republic, and\r\nthe wise critics who revile the Virginians for not having instituted a\r\npeerage, appear equally ridiculous to all men of sense and candour.\r\n\r\nThat is the best government which desires to make the people happy, and\r\nknows how to make them happy. Neither the inclination nor the knowledge\r\nwill suffice alone; and it is difficult to find them together!\r\n\r\nPure democracy, and pure democracy alone, satisfies the former condition\r\nof this great problem. That the governors may be solicitous only for\r\nthe interests of the governed, it is necessary that the interests of the\r\ngovernors and the governed should be the same. This cannot be often the\r\ncase where power is intrusted to one or to a few. The privileged part of\r\nthe community will doubtless derive a certain degree of advantage from\r\nthe general prosperity of the state; but they will derive a greater from\r\noppression and exaction. The king will desire an useless war for his\r\nglory, or a _parc-aux-cerfs_ for his pleasure. The nobles will demand\r\nmonopolies and _lettres-de-câchet_. In proportion as the number of\r\ngovernors is increased the evil is diminished. There are fewer to\r\ncontribute, and more to receive. The dividend which each can obtain of\r\nthe public plunder becomes less and less tempting. But the interests\r\n{180}of the subjects and the rulers never absolutely coincide till the\r\nsubjects themselves become the rulers, that is, till the government be\r\neither immediately or mediately democratical.\r\n\r\nBut this is not enough. “Will without power,” said the sagacious Casimir\r\nto Milor Beefington, “is like children playing at soldiers.” The people\r\nwill always be desirous to promote their own interests; but it may be\r\ndoubted, whether, in any community, they were ever sufficiently educated\r\nto understand them. Even in this island, where the multitude have long\r\nbeen better informed than in any other part of Europe, the rights of the\r\nmany have generally been asserted against themselves by the patriotism\r\nof the few. Free trade, one of the greatest blessings which a government\r\ncan confer on a people, is in almost every country unpopular. It may\r\nbe well doubted, whether a liberal policy with regard to our commercial\r\nrelations would find any support from a parliament elected by universal\r\nsuffrage. The republicans on the other side of the Atlantic have\r\nrecently adopted regulations of which the consequences will, before\r\nlong, show us,\r\n\r\n               “How nations sink, by darling schemes oppressed,\r\n\r\n               When vengeance listens to the fool’s request.\"\r\n\r\nThe people are to be governed for their own good; and, that they may\r\nbe governed for their own good, they must not be governed by their\r\nown ignorance. There are countries in which it would be as absurd to\r\nestablish popular government as to abolish all the restraints in a\r\nschool, or to untie all the strait-waistcoats in a madhouse.\r\n\r\nHence it may be concluded that the happiest state of society is that in\r\nwhich supreme power resides in {181}the whole body of a well-informed\r\npeople. This is an imaginary, perhaps an unattainable, state of things.\r\nYet, in some measure, we may approximate to it; and he alone deserves\r\nthe name of a great statesman, whose principle it is to extend the power\r\nof the people in proportion to the extent of their knowledge, and to\r\ngive them every facility for obtaining such a degree of knowledge as may\r\nrender it safe to trust them with absolute power. In the mean time, it\r\nis dangerous to praise or condemn constitutions in the abstract; since,\r\nfrom the despotism of St. Petersburg to the democracy of Washington,\r\nthere is scarcely a form of government which might not, at least in some\r\nhypothetical case, be the best possible.\r\n\r\nIf, however, there be any form of government which in all ages and all\r\nnations has always been, and must always be, pernicious, it is certainly\r\nthat which Mr. Mitford, on his usual principle of being wiser than all\r\nthe rest of the world, has taken under his especial patronage--pure\r\noligarchy. This is closely, and indeed inseparably, connected with\r\nanother of his eccentric tastes, a marked partiality for Lacedæmon, and\r\na dislike of Athens. Mr. Mitford’s book has, I suspect, rendered these\r\nsentiments in some degree popular; and I shall, therefore, examine them\r\nat some length.\r\n\r\nThe shades in the Athenian character strike the eye more rapidly than\r\nthose in the Lacedaemonian: not because they are darker, but because\r\nthey are on a brighter ground. The law of ostracism is an instance\r\nof this. Nothing can be conceived more odious than the practice of\r\npunishing a citizen, simply and professedly, for his eminence;--and\r\nnothing in the institutions of Athens is more frequently or more justly\r\ncensured. Lacedaemon; was free from this. And why? Lacedæmon {182}did\r\nnot need it. Oligarchy is an ostracism of itself,--an ostracism not\r\noccasional, but permanent,--not dubious, but certain. Her laws prevented\r\nthe development of merit, instead of attacking its maturity. They did\r\nnot cut down the plant in its high and palmy state, but cursed the\r\nsoil with eternal sterility. In spite of the law of ostracism, Athens\r\nproduced, within a hundred and fifty years, the greatest public men that\r\never existed. Whom had Sparta to ostracise? She produced, at most, four\r\neminent men, Brasidas, Gylip-pus, Lysander, and Agesilaus. Of these, not\r\none rose to distinction within her jurisdiction. It was only when\r\nthey escaped from the region within which the influence of aristocracy\r\nwithered everything good and noble, it was only when they ceased to be\r\nLacedæmonians, that they became great men. Brasidas, among the cities\r\nof Thrace, was strictly a democratical leader, the favourite minister\r\nand general of the people. The same may be said of Gylippus, at\r\nSyracuse. Lysander, in the Hellespont, and Agesilaus, in Asia, were\r\nliberated for a time from the hateful restraints imposed by the\r\nconstitution of Lycurgus. Both acquired feme abroad; and both returned\r\nto be watched and depressed at home. This is not peculiar to Sparta.\r\nOligarchy, wherever it has existed, has always stunted the growth of\r\ngenius. Thus it was at Rome, till about a century before the Christian\r\nera: we read of abundance of consuls and dictators who won battles,\r\nand enjoyed triumphs; but we look in vain for a single man of the first\r\norder of intellect,--for a Pericles, a Demosthenes, or a Hannibal.\r\nThe Gracchi formed a strong democratical party; Marius revived it; the\r\nfoundations of the old aristocracy were shaken; and two generations\r\nfertile in really great men appeared. {183}Venice is a still more\r\nremarkable instance: in her history we see nothing but the state;\r\naristocracy had destroyed every seed of genius and virtue. Her dominion\r\nwas like herself, lofty and magnificent, but founded on filth and weeds.\r\nGod forbid that there should ever again exist a powerful and civilised\r\nstate, which, after existing through thirteen hundred eventful years,\r\nshall not bequeath to mankind the memory of one great name or one\r\ngenerous action.\r\n\r\nMany writers, and Mr. Mitford among the number, have admired the\r\nstability of the Spartan institutions; in fact, there is little to\r\nadmire, and less to approve. Oligarchy is the weakest and most stable\r\nof governments; and it is stable because it is weak. It has a sort of\r\nvaletudinarian longevity; it lives in the balance of Sanctorius; it\r\ntakes no exercise; it exposes itself to no accident; it is seized with\r\nan hypochondriac alarm at every new sensation; it trembles at every\r\nbreath; it lets blood for every inflammation: and thus, without ever\r\nenjoying a day of health or pleasure, drags on its existence to a doting\r\nand debilitated old age.\r\n\r\nThe Spartans purchased for their government a prolongation of its\r\nexistence by the sacrifice of happiness at home and dignity abroad. They\r\ncringed to the powerful; they trampled on the weak; they massacred their\r\nHelots; they betrayed their allies; they contrived to be a day too\r\nlate for the battle of Marathon; they attempted to avoid the battle of\r\nSalamis; they suffered the Athenians, to whom they owed then-lives\r\nand liberties, to be a second time driven from their country by the\r\nPersians, that they might finish their own fortifications on the\r\nIsthmus; they attempted to take advantage of the distress to which\r\nexertions {184}in their cause had reduced their preservers, in order to\r\nmake them their slaves; they strove to prevent those who had abandoned\r\ntheir walls to defend them, from rebuilding them to defend themselves;\r\nthey commenced the Peloponnesian war in violation of their engagements\r\nwith Athens; they abandoned it in violation of their engagements with\r\ntheir allies; they gave up to the sword whole cities which had placed\r\nthemselves under their protection; they bartered, for advantages\r\nconfined to themselves, the interest, the freedom, and the lives\r\nof those who had served them most faithfully; they took with equal\r\ncomplacency, and equal infamy, the stripes of Elis and the bribes of\r\nPersia; they never showed either resentment or gratitude; they abstained\r\nfrom no injury; and they revenged none. Above all, they looked on a\r\ncitizen who served them well as their deadliest enemy. These are the\r\narts which protract the existence of governments.\r\n\r\nNor were the domestic institutions of Lacedæmon less hateful or less\r\ncontemptible than her foreign policy. A perpetual interference with\r\nevery part of the system of human life, a constant struggle against\r\nnature and reason, characterised all her laws. To violate even\r\nprejudices which have taken deep root in the minds of a people is\r\nscarcely expedient; to think of extirpating natural appetites and\r\npassions is frantic: the external symptoms may be occasionally\r\nrepressed; but the feeling still exists, and, debarred from its natural\r\nobjects, preys on the disordered mind and body of its victim. Thus it\r\nis in convents--thus it is among ascetic sects--thus it was among the\r\nLacedæmonians.\r\n\r\nHence arose that madness, or violence approaching to madness, which, in\r\nspite of every external {185}restraint, often appeared among the most\r\ndistinguished citizens of Sparta. Cleomenes terminated his career of\r\nraving cruelty by cutting himself to pieces. Pausanias seems to have\r\nbeen absolutely insane: he formed a hopeless and profligate scheme; he\r\nbetrayed it by the ostentation of his behaviour, and the imprudence of\r\nhis measures; and he alienated, by his insolence, all who might have\r\nserved or protected him. Xenophon, a warm admirer of Lacedaemon,\r\nfurnishes us with the strongest evidence to this effect. It is\r\nimpossible not to observe the brutal and senseless fury which\r\ncharacterises almost every Spartan with whom he was connected. Clearchus\r\nnearly lost his life by his cruelty. Chirisophus deprived his army\r\nof the services of a faithful guide by his unreasonable and ferocious\r\nseverity. But it is needless to multiply instances. Lycurgus, Mr.\r\nMitford’s favourite legislator, founded his whole system on a mistaken\r\nprinciple. He never considered that governments were made for men, and\r\nnot men for governments. Instead of adapting the constitution to the\r\npeople, he distorted the minds of the people to suit the constitution, a\r\nscheme worthy of the Laputan Academy of Projectors. And this appears\r\nto Mr. Mitford to constitute his peculiar title to admiration. Hear\r\nhimself: “What to modern eyes most strikingly sets that extraordinary\r\nman above all other legislators is, that in so many circumstances,\r\napparently out of the reach of law, he controlled and formed to his own\r\nmind the wills and habits of his people.” I should suppose that this\r\ngentleman had the advantage of receiving his education under the ferula\r\nof Dr. Pangloss; for his metaphysics are clearly those of the castle\r\nof Thunder-ten-tronckh: “Remarquez bien epie les nez ont été faits pour\r\nporter des lunettes, {186}aussi avons nous des lunettes. Les jambes sont\r\nvisiblement instituées pour être chaussées, et nous avons des chausses.\r\nLes cochons étant faits pour être mangés, nous mangeons du porc toute\r\nl’année.”\r\n\r\nAt Athens the laws did not constantly interfere with the tastes of\r\nthe people. The children were not taken from their parents by that\r\nuniversal step-mother, the state. They were not starved into thieves, or\r\ntortured into bullies; there was no established table at which every\r\none must dine, no established style in which every one must converse. An\r\nAthenian might eat whatever he could afford to buy, and talk as long as\r\nhe could find people to listen. The government did not tell the people\r\nwhat opinions they were to hold, or what songs they were to sing.\r\nFreedom produced excellence. Thus philosophy took its origin. Thus were\r\nproduced those models of poetry, of oratory, and of the arts, which\r\nscarcely fall short of the standard of ideal excellence. Nothing is more\r\nconducive to happiness than the free exercise of the mind in pursuits\r\ncongenial to it. This happiness, assuredly, was enjoyed far more at\r\nAthens than at Sparta. The Athenians are acknowledged even by their\r\nenemies to have been distinguished, in private life, by their courteous\r\nand amiable demeanour. Their levity, at least, was better then Spartan\r\nsullenness, and their impertinence, than Spartan insolence. Even\r\nin courage it may be questioned whether they were inferior to the\r\nLacedæmonians. The great Athenian historian has reported a remarkable\r\nobservation of the great Athenian minister. Pericles maintained that his\r\ncountrymen, without submitting to the hardships of a Spartan education,\r\nrivalled all the achievements of Spartan valour, and that therefore the\r\npleasures and {187}amusements which they enjoyed were to be considered\r\nas so much clear gain. The infantry of Athens was certainly not equal to\r\nthat of Lacedæmon; but this seems to have been caused merely by want\r\nof practice; the attention of the Athenians was diverted from the\r\ndiscipline of the phalanx to that of the trireme. The Lacedæinonians, in\r\nspite of all their boasted valour, were, from the same cause, timid and\r\ndisorderly in naval action.\r\n\r\nBut we are told that crimes of great enormity were perpetrated by the\r\nAthenian Government, and the democracies under its protection. It is\r\ntrue that Athens too often acted up to the full extent of the laws of\r\nwar, in an age when those laws had not been mitigated by causes which\r\nhave operated in later times. This accusation is, in fact, common to\r\nAthens, to Lacedæmon, to all the states of Greece, and to all states\r\nsimilarly situated. Where communities are very large, the heavier evils\r\nof war are felt but by few. The plough-boy sings, the spinning-wheel\r\nturns round, the wedding-day is fixed, whether the last battle were lost\r\nor won. In little states it cannot be thus; every man feels in his own\r\nproperty and person the effect of a war. Every man is a soldier, and a\r\nsoldier fighting for his nearest interests. His own trees have been cut\r\ndown--his own corn has been burnt--his own house has been pillaged--his\r\nown relations have been killed. How can he entertain towards the enemies\r\nof his country the same feelings with one who has suffered nothing; from\r\nthem, except perhaps the addition of a small sum to the taxes which he\r\npays. Men in such circumstances cannot be generous. They have too much\r\nat stake. It is when they are, if I may so express myself, playing\r\nfor love, it is when war is a mere game at chess, it is when they are\r\ncontending for a remote colony, a frontier town, {188}the honours of\r\na flag, a salute, or a title, that they can make fine speeches, and do\r\ngood offices to their enemies. The Black Prince waited behind the chair\r\nof his captive; Villars interchanged repartees with Eugene: George II.\r\nsent congratulations to Louis XV., during a war, upon occasion of\r\nhis escape from the attempt of Damien: and these things are fine and\r\ngenerous, and very gratifying to the author of the Broad Stone of\r\nHonour, and all the other wise men who think, like him, that God made\r\nthe world only for the use of gentlemen. But they spring in general\r\nfrom utter heartlessness. No war ought ever to be undertaken but under\r\ncircumstances which render all interchange of courtesy between the\r\ncombatants impossible. It is a bad thing that men should hate each\r\nother; but it is far worse that they should contract the habit of\r\ncutting one another’s throats without hatred. War is never lenient, but\r\nwhere it is wanton; when men are compelled to fight in self-defence,\r\nthey must hate and avenge: this may be bad; but it is human nature: it\r\nis the clay as it came from the hand of the potter.\r\n\r\nIt is true that among the dependencies of Athens seditions assumed\r\na character more ferocious than even in France, during the reign of\r\nterror--the accursed Saturnalia of an accursed bondage. It is true\r\nthat in Athens itself, where such convulsions were scarcely known,\r\nthe condition of the higher orders was dis agreeable; that they were\r\ncompelled to contribute large sums for the service or the amusement\r\nof the public; and that they were sometimes harassed by vexatious\r\ninformers. Whenever such cases occur, Mr. Mitford’s scepticism vanishes.\r\nThe “if,” the “but,” the “it is said,” the “if we may believe,” with\r\nwhich he qualifies every charge against a tyrant or an aristocracy, are\r\nat {189}once abandoned. The blacker the story, the firmer is his belief;\r\nand he never fails to inveigh with hearty bitterness against democracy\r\nas the source of every species of crime.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, I believe, possessed more liberty than was good for\r\nthem. Yet I will venture to assert that, while the splendour, the\r\nintelligence, and the energy of that great people were peculiar to\r\nthemselves, the crimes with which they are charged arose from causes\r\nwhich were common to them with every other state which then existed.\r\nThe violence of faction in that age sprung from a cause which has always\r\nbeen fertile in every political and moral evil, domestic slavery.\r\n\r\nThe effect of slavery is completely to dissolve the connection which\r\nnaturally exists between the higher and lower classes of free citizens.\r\nThe rich spend their wealth in purchasing and maintaining slaves. There\r\nis no demand for the labour of the poor; the fable of Menenius ceases to\r\nbe applicable; the belly communicates no nutriment to the members; there\r\nis an atrophy in the body politic. The two parties, therefore, proceed\r\nto extremities utterly unknown in countries where they have mutually\r\nneed of each other. In Rome the oligarchy was too powerful to be\r\nsubverted by force; and neither the tribunes nor the popular assemblies,\r\nthough constitutionally omnipotent, could maintain a successful contest\r\nagainst men who possessed the whole property of the state. Hence the\r\nnecessity for measures tending; to unsettle the whole frame of society,\r\nand to take away every motive of industry; the abolition of debts, and\r\nthe agrarian laws--propositions absurdly condemned by men who do\r\nnot consider the circumstances from which they sprung. They were\r\nthe desperate remedies of a desperate disease. In {190}Greece the\r\noligarchical interest was not in general so deeply rooted as at Rome.\r\nThe multitude, therefore, often redressed by force grievances which, at\r\nRome, were commonly attacked under the forais of the constitution. They\r\ndrove out or massacred the rich, and divided their property. If the\r\nsuperior union or military skill of the rich rendered them victorious,\r\nthey took measures equally violent, disarmed all in whom they could not\r\nconfide, often slaughtered great numbers and occasionally expelled the\r\nwhole commonalty from the city, and remained, with their slaves, the\r\nsole inhabitants.\r\n\r\nFrom such calamities Athens and Laeedæmon alone were almost completely\r\nfree. At Athens the purses of the rich were laid under regular\r\ncontribution for the support of the poor; and this, rightly considered,\r\nwas as much a favour to the givers as to the receivers, since no other\r\nmeasure could possibly have saved their houses from pillage and\r\ntheir persons from violence. It is singular that Mr. Mitford should\r\nperpetually reprobate a policy which was the best that could be pursued\r\nin such a state of things, and which alone saved Athens from the\r\nfrightful outrages which were perpetrated at Coreyra.\r\n\r\nLacedæmon, cursed with a system of slavery more odious than has ever\r\nexisted in any other country, avoided this evil by almost totally\r\nannihilating private property. Lycurgus began by an agrarian law. He\r\nabolished all professions except that of arms; he made the whole of his\r\ncommunity a standing army, every member of which had a common right to\r\nthe services of a crowd of miserable bondmen; he secured the state from\r\nsedition at the expense of the Helots. Of all the parts of his system\r\nthis is the most creditable to his head, and the most disgraceful to his\r\nheart. {191}These considerations, and many others of equal importance,\r\nMr. Mitford lias neglected; but he has yet a heavier charge to answer.\r\nHe has made not only illogical inferences, but false statements. While\r\nhe never states, without qualifications and objections, the charges\r\nwhich the earliest and best historians have brought against his\r\nfavourite tyrants, Pisistratus, Hip-pias, and Gelon, he transcribes,\r\nwithout any hesitation, the grossest abuse of the least authoritative\r\nwriters against every democracy and every demagogue. Such an accusation\r\nshould not be made without being supported; and I will therefore select\r\none out of many passages which will fully substantiate the charge,\r\nand convict Mr. Mitford of wilful misrepresentation, or of negligence\r\nscarcely less culpable. Mr. Mitford is speaking of one of the greatest\r\nmen that ever lived, Demosthenes, and comparing him with his rival,\r\nÆschines. Let him speak for himself.\r\n\r\n“In earliest youth Demosthenes earned an opprobrious nickname by\r\nthe effeminacy of his dress and manner.” Does Mr. Mitford know that\r\nDemosthenes denied this charge, and explained the nickname in a\r\nperfectly different manner? (1) And if he knew it, should he not\r\nhave stated it? He proceeds thus:--“On emerging from minority, by the\r\nAthenian law, at five-and-twenty, he earned another opprobrious\r\nnickname by a prosecution of his guardians, which was considered as a\r\ndishonourable attempt to extort money from them.” In the first place,\r\nDemosthenes was not five-and-twenty years of age. Mr. Mitford might have\r\nlearned, from so common a book as the Archæologia of Archbishop Potter,\r\nthat at twenty Athenian citizens were freed from the control of their\r\nguardians,\r\n\r\n     (1) See the speech of Æschines against Timarchus.\r\n\r\n{192}and began to manage their own property. The very speech of\r\nDemosthenes against his guardians proves most satisfactorily that he\r\nwas under twenty. In his speech against Midias, he says that when\r\nhe undertook that prosecution he was quite a boy. His youth might,\r\ntherefore, excuse the step, even if it had been considered, as\r\nMr. Mitford says, a dishonourable attempt to extort money. But who\r\nconsidered it as such? «Not the judges, who condemned the guardians. The\r\nAthenian courts of justice were not the purest in the world; but their\r\ndecisions were at least as likely to be just as the abuse of a deadly\r\nenemy. Mr. Mitford refers for confirmation of his statement to Æschines\r\nand Plutarch..Æschines by no means beat’s him out; and Plutarch directly\r\ncontradicts him. “Hot long after,” says Mr. Mitford, “he took blows\r\npublicly in the theater” (I preserve the orthography, if it can be\r\nso called, of this historian) “from a petulant youth of rank, named\r\nMeidias.” Here are two disgraceful mistakes. In the first place, it was\r\nlong after; eight years at the very least, probably much more. In the\r\nnext place, the petulant youth, of whom Mr. Mitford speaks, was fifty\r\nyears old. (2) Really Mr. Mitford has less reason to censure the\r\ncarelessness of his predecessors than to reform his own. After this\r\nmonstrous inaccuracy, with regard to facts, we may be able to judge what\r\ndegree of credit ought to be given to the vague abuse of such a writer.\r\n“The cowardice of Demosthenes in the field afterwards became notorious.”\r\n Demosthenes was a civil character; war was\r\n\r\n     (2)Whoever will read the speech of Demosthenes against\r\n     Midias will find the statements in the text confirmed, and\r\n     will have, moreover, the pleasure of becoming acquainted\r\n     with one of the finest compositions in the world.\r\n\r\n{193}not his business. In his time the division between military\r\nand political offices was beginning to be strongly marked; yet the\r\nrecollection of the days when every citizen was a soldier was still\r\nrecent. In such states of society a certain degree of disrepute always\r\nattaches to sedentary men; but that any leader of the Athenian democracy\r\ncould have been, as Mr. Mitford says of Demosthenes, a few lines before,\r\nremarkable for “an extraordinary deficiency of personal courage,” is\r\nabsolutely impossible. What mercenary warrior of the time exposed his\r\nlife to greater or more constant perils? Was there a single soldier at\r\nChæronea who had more cause to tremble for his safety than the orator,\r\nwho, in case of defeat, could scarcely hope for mercy from the people\r\nwhom he had misled or the prince whom lie had opposed? Were not the\r\nordinary fluctuations of popular feeling enough to deter any coward from\r\nengaging in political conflicts? Isocrates, whom Mr. Mitford extols,\r\nbecause he constantly employed all the flowers of his school-boy\r\nrhetoric to decorate oligarchy and tyranny, avoided the judicial and\r\npolitical meetings of Athens from mere timidity, and seems to have hated\r\ndemocracy only because he durst not look a popular assembly in the face.\r\nDemosthenes was a man of a feeble constitution: his nerves were weak;\r\nbut his spirit was high: and the energy and enthusiasm of his feelings\r\nsupported him through life and in death.\r\n\r\nSo much for Demosthenes. Now for the orator of aristocracy. I do not\r\nwish to abuse Æschines. He may have been an honest man. He was certainly\r\na great man; and I feel a reverence, of which Mr. Mitford seems to have\r\nno notion, for great men of every party. But, when Mr. Mitford says\r\nthat the private character {194}of Æscliines was without stain, does\r\nhe remember what Æschines has himself confessed in his speech against\r\nTimarchus? I can make allowances, as well as Mr. Mitford, for persons\r\nwho lived under a different system of laws and morals; but let them be\r\nmade impartially. If Demosthenes is to be attacked on account of some\r\nchildish improprieties, proved only by the assertion of an antagonist,\r\nwhat shall we say of those maturer vices which that antagonist has\r\nhimself acknowledged? “Against the private character of Æschines,”\r\n says Mr. Mitford, “Demosthenes seems not to have had an insinuation\r\nto oppose.” Has Mr. Mitford ever read the speech of Demosthenes on the\r\nEmbassy? Or can he have forgotten, what was never forgotten by any one\r\nelse who ever read it, the story which Demosthenes relates with such\r\nterrible energy of language concerning the drunken brutality of his\r\nrival? True or false, here is something more than an insinuation; and\r\nnothing can vindicate the historian, who has overlooked it, from the\r\ncharge of negligence or of partiality. But Æschines denied the story.\r\nAnd did not Demosthenes also deny the story respecting his childish\r\nnickname, which Mr. Mitford has nevertheless told without any\r\nqualification? But the judges, or some part of them, showed, by their\r\nclamour, their disbelief of the relation of Demosthenes. And did not\r\nthe judges, who tried the cause between Demosthenes and his guardians,\r\nindicate, in a much clearer manner, their approbation of the\r\nprosecution? But Demosthenes was a demagogue, and is to be slandered.\r\nÆscliines was an aristocrat, and is to be panegyrised. Is this a\r\nhistory, or a party pamphlet?\r\n\r\nThese passages, all selected from a single page of Mr. Mitford’s work,\r\nmay give some notion to those {195}readers, who have not the means of\r\ncomparing his statements with the original authorities, of his extreme\r\npartiality and carelessness. Indeed, whenever this historian mentions\r\nDemosthenes, he violates all the laws of candour and even of decency;\r\nhe weighs no authorities; he makes no allowances; he forgets the best\r\nauthenticated facts in the history of the times, and the most generally\r\nrecognised principles of human nature. The opposition of the great\r\norator to the policy of Philip he represents as neither more nor less\r\nthan deliberate villainy. I hold almost the same opinion with Mr.\r\nMitford respecting the character and the views of that great and\r\naccomplished prince. But am I, therefore, to pronounce Demosthenes\r\nprofligate and insincere? Surely not. Do we not perpetually see men of\r\nthe greatest talents and the purest intentions misled by national or\r\nfactious prejudices? The most respectable people in England were, little\r\nmore than forty years ago, in the habit of uttering the bitterest abuse\r\nagainst Washington and Franklin. It is certainly to be regretted that\r\nmen should err so grossly in their estimate of character. But no person\r\nwho knows anything of human nature will impute such errors to depravity.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitford is not more consistent with himself than with reason. Though\r\nhe is the advocate of all oligarchies, he is also a warm admirer of\r\nall kings, and of all citizens who raised themselves to that species of\r\nsovereignty which the Greeks denominated tyranny. If monarchy, as Mr.\r\nMitford holds, be in itself a blessing, democracy must be a better\r\nform of government than aristocracy, which is always opposed to the\r\nsupremacy, and even to the eminence, of individuals. On the other hand,\r\nit is {196}but one step that separates the demagogue and the sovereign.\r\n\r\nIf this article had not extended itself to so great a length, I\r\nshould offer a few observations on some other peculiarities of this\r\nwriter,--his general preference of the Barbarians to the Greeks,--his\r\npredilection for Persians, Carthaginians, Thracians, for all nations,\r\nin short, except that great and enlightened nation of which he is the\r\nhistorian. But I will confine myself to a single topic.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitford has remarked, with truth and spirit, that “any history\r\nperfectly written, but especially a Grecian history perfectly written,\r\nshould be a political institute for all nations.” It has not occurred to\r\nhim that a Grecian history, perfectly written, should also be a complete\r\nrecord of the rise and progress of poetry, philosophy, and the arts.\r\nHere his work is extremely deficient. Indeed, though it may seem a\r\nstrange thing to say of a gentleman who has published so many quartos,\r\nMr. Mitford seems to entertain a feeling, bordering on contempt,\r\nfor literary and speculative pursuits. The talents of action almost\r\nexclusively attract his notice; and he talks with very complacent\r\ndisdain of “the idle learned.” Homer, indeed, he admires; but\r\nprincipally, I am afraid, because he is convinced that Homer could\r\nneither read nor write. He could not avoid speaking of Socrates; but he\r\nhas been far more solicitous to trace his death to political causes, and\r\nto deduce from it consequences unfavourable to Athens, and to popular\r\ngovernments, than to throw light on the character and doctrines of the\r\nwonderful man,\r\n\r\n\r\n                   “From whose mouth issued forth\r\n\r\n               Mellifluous streams that watered all the schools\r\n\r\n               Of Academics, old and new, with those\r\n\r\n               Surnamed Peripatetics, and the sect\r\n\r\n               Epicurean, and the Stoic severe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n{197}He does not seem to be aware that Demosthenes was a great orator;\r\nhe represents him sometimes as an aspiring demagogue, sometimes as an\r\nadroit negotiator, and always as a great rogue. But that in which the\r\nAthenian excelled all men of all ages, that irresistible eloquence,\r\nwhich at the distance of more than two thousand years stirs our blood,\r\nand brings tears into our eyes, he passes by with a few phrases of\r\ncommonplace commendation. The origin of the drama, the doctrines of the\r\nsophists, the course of Athenian education, the state of the arts\r\nand sciences, the whole domestic system of the Greeks, he lias almost\r\ncompletely neglected. Yet these things will appear, to a reflecting man,\r\nscarcely less worthy of attention than the taking of Sphaeteria or the\r\ndiscipline of the targeteers of Iphierates.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, is a deficiency by no means peculiar to Mr. Mitford.\r\nMost people seem to imagine that a detail of public occurrences--the\r\noperations of sieges--the changes of administrations--the treaties--the\r\nconspiracies--the rebellions--is a complete history. Differences of\r\ndefinition are logically unimportant; but practically they sometimes\r\nproduce the most momentous effects. Thus it has been in the present\r\nease. Historians have, almost without exception, confined themselves\r\nto the public transactions of states, and have left to the negligent\r\nadministration of writers of fiction a province at least equally\r\nextensive and valuable.\r\n\r\nAll wise statesmen have agreed to consider the prosperity or adversity\r\nof nations as made up of the happiness or misery of individuals, and to\r\nreject as chimerical all notions of a public interest of the community,\r\ndistinct from the interest of the component parts. It {198}is therefore\r\nstrange that those whose office it is to supply statesmen with examples\r\nand warnings should omit, as too mean for the dignity of history,\r\ncircumstances which exert the most extensive influence on the state of\r\nsociety. In general, the under current of human life flows steadily on,\r\nunruffled by the storms which agitate the surface. The happiness of the\r\nmany commonly depends on causes independent of victories or defeats, of\r\nrevolutions or restorations,--causes which can be regulated by no laws,\r\nand which are recorded in no archives. These causes are the things which\r\nit is of main importance to us to know, not how the Lacedæmonian phalanx\r\nwas broken at Leuctra--not whether Alexander died of poison or by\r\ndiseased History, without these, is a shell without a kernel; and\r\nsuch is almost all the history which is extant in the world. Paltry\r\nskirmishes and plots are reported with absurd and useless minuteness;\r\nbut improvements the most essential to the comfort of human life extend\r\nthemselves over the world, and introduce themselves into every cottage,\r\nbefore any annalist can condescend, from the dignity of writing about\r\ngenerals and ambassadors, to take the least notice of them. Thus the\r\nprogress of the most salutary inventions and discoveries is buried in\r\nimpenetrable mystery; mankind are deprived of a most useful species of\r\nknowledge, and their benefactors of their honest fame. In the meantime\r\nevery child knows by heart the dates and adventures of a long line of\r\nbarbarian kings. The history of nations, in the sense in which I use\r\nthe word, is often best studied in works not professedly historical.\r\nThucydides, as far as he goes, is an excellent writer; yet he affords\r\nns far less knowledge of the most important particulars relating {199}to\r\nAthens than Plato or Aristophanes. The little treatise of Xenophon on\r\nDomestic Economy contains more historical information than all the seven\r\nhooks of his Hellenics. The same may be said of the Satires of Horace,\r\nof the Letters of Cicero, of the novels of Le Sage, of the memoirs of\r\nMarin on tel. Many others might be mentioned; but these sufficiently\r\nillustrate my meaning.\r\n\r\nI would hope that there may yet appear a writer who may despise the\r\npresent narrow limits, and assert the ‘rights of history over every part\r\nof her natural domain. Should such a writer engage in that enterprise,\r\nin which I cannot but consider Mr. Mitford as having failed, he will\r\nrecord, indeed, all that is interesting and important in military and\r\npolitical transactions; but he will not think anything too trivial for\r\nthe gravity of history which is not too trivial to promote or diminish\r\nthe happiness of man. He will portray in vivid colours the domestic\r\nsociety, the manners, the amusements, the conversation of the Greeks. He\r\nwill not disdain to discuss the state of agriculture, of the mechanical\r\narts, and of the conveniences of life. The progress of painting, of\r\nsculpture, and of architecture, will form an important part of his\r\nplan. But, above all, his attention will be given to the history of that\r\nsplendid literature from which has sprung all the strength, the wisdom,\r\nthe freedom, and the glory, of the western world.\r\n\r\nOf the indifference which Mr. Mitford shows on this subject I will not\r\nspeak; for I cannot speak with fairness. It is a subject on which I love\r\nto forget the accuracy of a judge, in the veneration of a worshipper\r\nand the gratitude of a child. If we consider merely the subtlety of\r\ndisquisition, the force of imagination, {200}the perfect energy and\r\nelegance of expression, which characterise the great works of Athenian\r\ngenius, we must pronounce them intrinsically most valuable; but what\r\nshall we say when we reflect that from hence have sprung, directly or\r\nindirectly, all the noblest creations of the human intellect; that from\r\nhence were the vast accomplishments, and the brilliant fancy of Cicero;\r\nthe withering fire of Juvenal; the plastic imagination of Dante; the\r\nhumour of Cervantes; the comprehension of Bacon; the wit of Butler;\r\nthe supreme and universal excellence of Shakspeare? All the triumphs of\r\ntruth and genius over prejudice and power, in every country and in every\r\nage, have been the triumphs of Athens. Wherever a few great minds have\r\nmade a stand against violence and fraud, in the cause of liberty and\r\nreason, there has been her spirit in the midst of them; inspiring,\r\nencouraging, consoling;--by the lonely lamp of Erasmus; by the restless\r\nbed of Pascal; in the tribune of Mirabeau; in the cell of Galileo; on\r\nthe scaffold of Sidney. But who shall estimate her influence on private\r\nhappiness? Who shall say how many thousands have been made wiser,\r\nhappier, and better, by those pursuits in which she has taught mankind\r\nto engage; to how many the studies which took their rise from her\r\nhave been wealth in poverty,--liberty in bondage,--health in sickness,\r\n--society in solitude? Her power is indeed manifested at the bar, in the\r\nsenate, in the field of battle, in the schools of philosophy. But these\r\nare not her glory. Wherever literature consoles sorrow, or assuages\r\npain,--wherever it brings gladness to eyes which fail with wakefulness\r\nand tears, and ache for the dark house and the long sleep,--there\r\nis exhibited, in its noblest form, the immortal influence of Athens.\r\n{201}The dervise, in the Arabian tale, did not hesitate to abandon to\r\nhis comrade the camels with their load of jewels and gold, while he\r\nretained the casket of that mysterious juice which enabled him to behold\r\nat one glance all the hidden riches of the universe. Surely it is no\r\nexaggeration to say that no external advantage is to be compared with\r\nthat purification of the intellectual eye which gives us to contemplate\r\nthe infinite wealth of the mental world, all the hoarded treasures of\r\nits primeval dynasties, all the shapeless ore of its yet unexplored\r\nmines. This is the gift of Athens to man. Her freedom and her power\r\nhave for more than twenty centuries been annihilated; her people have\r\ndegenerated into timid slaves: her language into a barbarous jargon;\r\nher temples have been given up to the successive depredations of Romans,\r\nTurks, and Scotchmen; but her intellectual empire is imperishable. And\r\nwhen those who have rivalled her greatness shall have shared her fate;\r\nwhen civilisation and knowledge shall have fixed their abode in distant\r\ncontinents; when the sceptre shall have passed away from England;\r\nwhen, perhaps, travellers from distant regions shall in vain labour to\r\ndecipher on some mouldering pedestal the name of our proudest chief;\r\nshall hear savage hymns chaunted to some misshapen idol, over the ruined\r\ndome of our proudest temple; and shall see a single naked fisherman wash\r\nhis nets in the river of the ten thousand masts;--her influence and\r\nher glory will still survive,--fresh in eternal youth, exempt from\r\nmutability and decay, immortal as the intellectual principle from which\r\nthey derived their origin, and over which they exercise their control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILTON.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n{202}(_Edinburgh Review_, August 1825.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the year 1823, Mr. Lemon, deputy keeper of the\r\nstate papers, in the course of his researches among the presses of his\r\noffice, met with a large Latin manuscript. With it were found corrected\r\ncopies of the foreign despatches written by Milton, while he filled the\r\noffice of Secretary, and several papers relating to the Popish Trials\r\nand the Rye-house Plot. The whole was wrapped up in an envelope,\r\nsuperscribed _To Mr. Skinner, Merchant_. On examination, the large\r\nmanuscript proved to be the long lost Essay on the Doctrines of\r\nChristianity, which, according to Wood and Toland, Milton finished after\r\nthe Restoration, and deposited with Cyriac Skinner. Skinner, it is well\r\nknown, held the same political opinions with his illustrious friend. It\r\nis therefore probable, as Mr. Lemon conjectures, that he may have fallen\r\nunder the suspicions of the government during that persecution of the\r\nWhigs which followed the dissolution of the Oxford parliament, and that,\r\nin consequence of a general seizure of his papers, this work may have\r\nbeen\r\n\r\n     (1) _Jonnis Miltoni, Angli, de Doctrinâ Cliristicinâ libri\r\n     duo posthumi_. A Treatise on Christian Doctrine, compiled\r\n     from the Holy Scriptures alone, by John Milton, translated\r\n     from the Original by Charles R. Sumner, M.A. &c. &c. 1825.\r\n\r\n{203}brought to the office in which it has been found. But whatever the\r\nadventures of the manuscript may have been, no doubt can exist that it\r\nis a genuine relic of the great poet.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner, who was commanded by his Majesty to edite and translate the\r\ntreatise, has acquitted himself of his task in a manner honourable to\r\nhis talents and to his character. His version is not indeed very easy or\r\nelegant; but it is entitled to the praise of clearness and fidelity.\r\nHis notes abound with interesting quotations, and have the rare merit\r\nof really elucidating the text. The preface is evidently the work of\r\na sensible and candid man, firm in his own religious opinions, and\r\ntolerant towards those of others.\r\n\r\nThe book itself will not add much to the fame of Milton. It is, like all\r\nhis Latin works, well written, though not exactly in the style of the\r\nprize essays of Oxford and Cambridge. There is no elaborate imitation\r\nof classical antiquity, no scrupulous purity, none of the ceremonial\r\ncleanness which characterizes the diction of our academical Pharisees.\r\nThe author does not attempt to polish and brighten his composition into\r\nthe Ciceronian gloss and brilliancy. He does not in short sacrifice\r\nsense and spirit to pedantic refinements. The nature of his subject\r\ncompelled him to use many words\r\n\r\n               “That would have made Quintilian stare and gasp.\"\r\n\r\nBut he writes with as much ease and freedom as if Latin were his mother\r\ntongue; and, where he is least happy, his failure seems to arise from\r\nthe carelessness of a native, not from the ignorance of a foreigner.\r\nWe may apply to him what Denham with great felicity says of Cowley. He\r\nwears the garb, but not the clothes of the ancients. {204}Throughout the\r\nvolume are discernible the traces of a powerful and independent mind,\r\nemancipated from the influence of authority, and devoted to the search\r\nof truth. Milton professes to form his system from the Bible alone; and\r\nhis digest of scriptural texts is certainly among the best that have\r\nappeared. But he is not always so happy in his inferences as in his\r\ncitations.\r\n\r\nSome of the heterodox doctrines which he avows seemed to have excited\r\nconsiderable amazement, particularly his Arianism, and his theory on the\r\nsubject of polygamy. Yet we can scarcely conceive that any person could\r\nhave read the Paradise Lost without suspecting him of the former; nor do\r\nwe think that any reader, acquainted with the history of his life, ought\r\nto be much startled at the latter. The opinions which he has expressed\r\nrespecting the nature of the Deity, the eternity of matter, and the\r\nobservation of the Sabbath, might, we think, have caused more just\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nBut we will not go into the discussion of these points. The book, were\r\nit far more orthodox or far more heretical than it is, would not much\r\nedify or corrupt the present generation. The men of our time are not to\r\nbe converted or perverted by quartos. A few more days, and this essay\r\nwill follow the _Defensio Populi_, to the dust and silence of the\r\nupper shelf. The name of its author, and the remarkable circumstances\r\nattending its publication, will secure to it a certain degree of\r\nattention. For a month or two it will occupy a few minutes of chat in\r\nevery drawing-room, and a few columns in every magazine; and it will\r\nthen, to borrow the elegant language of the play-bills, be withdrawn, to\r\nmake room for the forthcoming novelties. {205}We wish however to avail\r\nourselves of the interest, transient as it may he, which this work has\r\nexcited. The dexterous Capuchins never choose to preach on the life and\r\nmiracles of a saint, till they have awakened the devotional feelings of\r\ntheir auditors by exhibiting some relic of him, a thread of his garment,\r\na lock of his hair, or a drop of his blood. On the same principle, we\r\nintend to take advantage of the late interesting discovery, and, while\r\nthis memorial of a great and good man is still in the hands of all,\r\nto say something of his moral and intellectual qualities. Nor, we are\r\nconvinced, will the severest of our readers blame us if, on an occasion\r\nlike the present, we turn for a short time from the topics of the day,\r\nto commemorate, in all love and reverence, the genius and virtues of\r\nJohn Milton, the poet, the statesman, the philosopher, the glory of\r\nEnglish literature, the champion and the martyr of English liberty.\r\n\r\nIt is by his poetry that Milton is best known; and it is of his poetry\r\nthat we wish first to speak. By the general suffrage of the civilised\r\nworld, his place has been assigned among the greatest masters of the\r\nart. His detractors, however, though outvoted, have not been silenced.\r\nThere are many critics, and some of great name, who contrive in the\r\nsame breath to extol the poems and to decry the poet. The works they\r\nacknowledge, considered in themselves, may be classed among the noblest\r\nproductions of the human mind. But they will not allow the author to\r\nrank with those great men who, born in the infancy of civilisation,\r\nsupplied, by their own powers, the want of instruction, and, though\r\ndestitute of models themselves, bequeathed to posterity models which\r\ndefy imitation. Milton, it is said, inherited what his predecessors\r\ncreated: he lived {206}in an enlightened age; he received a finished\r\neducation; and we must therefore, if we would form a just estimate of\r\nhis powers, make large deductions in consideration of these advantages.\r\n\r\nWe venture to say, on the contrary, paradoxical as the remark may\r\nappear, that no poet has ever had to struggle with more unfavourable\r\ncircumstances than Milton. He doubted, as he has himself owned, whether\r\nhe had not been born “an age too late.” For this notion Johnson has\r\nthought fit to make him the butt of much clumsy ridicule. The poet, we\r\nbelieve, understood the nature of his art better than the critic. He\r\nknew that his poetical genius derived no advantage from the civilisation\r\nwhich surrounded him, or from the learning which he had acquired; and he\r\nlooked back with something like regret to the ruder age of simple words\r\nand vivid impressions.\r\n\r\nWe think that, as civilisation advances, poetry almost necessarily\r\ndeclines. Therefore, though we fervently admire those great works of\r\nimagination which have appeared in dark ages, we do not admire them the\r\nmore because they have appeared in dark ages. On the contrary, we hold\r\nthat the most wonderful and splendid proof of genius is a great poem\r\nproduced in a civilised age. We cannot understand why those who believe\r\nin that most orthodox article of literary faith, that the earliest poets\r\nare generally the best, should wonder at the rule as if it were\r\nthe exception. Surely the uniformity of the phænomenon indicates a\r\ncorresponding uniformity in the cause.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that common observers reason from the progress of the\r\nexperimental sciences to that of the imitative arts. The improvement of\r\nthe former is gradual and slow. Ages are spent in collecting materiales\r\n{207}more in separating and combining them. Even when a system has been\r\nformed, there is still something to add, to alter, or to reject. Every\r\ngeneration enjoys the use of a vast hoard bequeathed to it by antiquity,\r\nand transmits that hoard, augmented by fresh acquisitions, to future\r\nages. In these pursuits, therefore, the first speculators lie under\r\ngreat disadvantages, and, even when they fail, are entitled to praise.\r\nTheir pupils, with far inferior intellectual powers, speedily surpass\r\nthem in actual attainments. Every girl who has read Mrs. Marcet’s little\r\ndialogues on Political Economy could teach Montague or Walpole many\r\nlessons in finance. Any intelligent man may now, by resolutely applying\r\nhimself for a few years to mathematics, learn more than the great Newton\r\nknew after half a century of study and meditation.\r\n\r\nBut it is not thus with music, with painting, or with sculpture. Still\r\nless is it thus with poetry. The progress of refinement rarely supplies\r\nthese arts with better objects of imitation. It may indeed improve the\r\ninstruments which are necessary to the mechanical operations of the\r\nmusician, the sculptor, and the painter. But language, the machine of\r\nthe poet, is best fitted for his purpose in its rudest state. Nations,\r\nlike individuals, first perceive, and then abstract. They advance\r\nfrom particular images to general terms. Hence the vocabulary of an\r\nenlightened society is philosophical, that of a half-civilised people is\r\npoetical.\r\n\r\nThis change in the language of men is partly the cause and partly the\r\neffect of a corresponding change in the nature of their intellectual\r\noperations, of a change by which science gains and poetry loses.\r\nGeneralisation is necessary to the advancement of knowledge; but\r\nparticularly is indispensable to the creations {208}of the imagination.\r\nIn proportion as men know more and think more, they look less at\r\nindividuals and more at classes. They therefore make better theories\r\nand worse poems. They give us vague phrases instead of images, and\r\npersonified qualities instead of men. They may be better able to analyse\r\nhuman nature than their predecessors. But analysis is not the business\r\nof the poet. His office is to portray, not to dissect. He may believe\r\nin a moral sense, like Shaftesbury; he may refer all human actions to\r\nself-interest, like Helvetius; or he may never think about the matter\r\nat all. His creed on such subjects will no more influence his poetry,\r\nproperly so called, than the notions which a painter may have conceived\r\nrespecting the lacrymal glands, or the circulation of the blood,\r\nwill affect the tears of his Niobe, or the blushes of his Aurora. If\r\nShakespeare had written a book on the motives of human actions, it is\r\nby no means certain that it would have been a good one. It is extremely\r\nimprobable that it would have contained half so much able reasoning\r\non the sulbject as is to be found in the Fable of the Bees. But\r\ncould Mandeville have created an Iago? Well as he knew how to resolve\r\ncharacters into their elements, would he have been able to combine\r\nthose elements in such a manner as to make up a man, a real, living,\r\nindividual man?\r\n\r\nPerhaps no person can be a poet, or can even enjoy poetry, without a\r\ncertain unsoundness of mind, if any thing which gives so much pleasure\r\nought to be called unsoundness. By poetry we mean not all writing in\r\nverse, nor even all good writing in verse. Our definition excludes\r\nmany metrical compositions which, on other grounds, deserve the highest\r\npraise. By poetry we mean the art of employing words in such a manner\r\n{209}as to produce an illusion on the imagination, the art of doing\r\nby means of words what the painter does by means of colours. Thus the\r\ngreatest of poets has described it, in lines universally admired for the\r\nvigour and felicity of their diction, and still more valuable on account\r\nof the just notion which they convey of the art in which he excelled:\r\n\r\n                        “As imagination bodies forth\r\n\r\n               The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen\r\n\r\n               Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing\r\n\r\n               A local habitation and a name.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the fruits of the “fine frenzy” which he ascribes to the\r\npoet,--a fine frenzy doubtless, but still a frenzy. Truth, indeed, is\r\nessential to poetry; but it is the truth of madness. The reasonings are\r\njust; but the premises are false. After the first suppositions have been\r\nmade, every thing ought to be consistent; but those first suppositions\r\nrequire a degree of credulity which almost amounts to a partial and\r\ntemporary derangement of the intellect. Hence of all people children are\r\nthe most imaginative. They abandon themselves without reserve to every\r\nillusion. Every image which is strongly presented to their mental eye\r\nproduces on them the effect of reality. No man, whatever his sensibility\r\nmay be, is ever affected by Hamlet or Lear, as a little girl is affected\r\nby the story of poor Red Riding-hood. She knows that it is all false,\r\nthat wolves cannot speak, that there are no wolves in England. Yet in\r\nspite of her knowledge she believes; she weeps; she trembles; she dares\r\nnot go into a dark room lest she should feel the teeth of the monster at\r\nher throat. Such is the despotism of the imagination over uncultivated\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nIn a rude state of society men are children with a {210}greater variety\r\nof ideas. It is therefore in such a state of society that we may expect\r\nto find the poetical temperament in its highest perfection. In an\r\nenlightened age there will be much intelligence, much science, much\r\nphilosophy, abundance of just classification and subtle analysis,\r\nabundance of wit and eloquence, abundance of verses, and even of good\r\nones; but little poetry. Men will judge and compare; but they will not\r\ncreate. They will talk about the old poets, and comment on them, and to\r\na certain degree enjoy them. But they will scarcely be able to conceive\r\nthe effect which poetry produced on their ruder ancestors, the agony,\r\nthe ecstasy, the plenitude of belief. The Greek Rhapsodists, according\r\nto Plato, could scarce recite Homer without falling into convulsions.\r\nThe Mohawk hardly feels the scalping knife while he shouts his\r\ndeath-song. The power which the ancient bards of Wales and Germany\r\nexercised over their auditors seems to modern readers almost miraculous.\r\nSuch feelings are very rare in a civilised community, and most rare\r\namong those who participate most in its improvements. They linger\r\nlongest among the peasantry.\r\n\r\nPoetry produces an illusion on the eye of the mind, as a magic lantern\r\nproduces an illusion on the eye of the body. And, as the magic lantern\r\nacts best in a dark room, poetry effects its purpose most completely in\r\na dark age. As the light of knowledge breaks in upon its exhibitions, as\r\nthe outlines of certainty become more and more definite and the shades\r\nof probability more and more distinct, the hues and lineaments’ of the\r\nphantoms which the poet calls up grow fainter and fainter. We cannot\r\nunite the incompatible advantages of reality and deception, the clear\r\ndiscernment of truth and the exquisite enjoyment of fiction. {211}He\r\nwho, in an enlightened and literary society, aspires to be a great poet,\r\nmust first become a little child. He must take to pieces the whole web\r\nof his mind. He must unlearn much of that knowledge which has perhaps\r\nconstituted hitherto his chief title to superiority. His very talents\r\nwill be a hindrance to him. His difficulties will be proportioned to\r\nhis proficiency in the pursuits which are fashionable among his\r\ncontemporaries; and that proficiency will in general be proportioned to\r\nthe vigour and activity of his mind. And it is well if, after all his.\r\nsacrifices and exertions, his works do not resemble a lisping man or a\r\nmodern ruin. We have seen in our own time great talents, intense labour,\r\nand long meditation, employed in this struggle against the spirit of the\r\nage, and employed, we will not say absolutely in vain, but with dubious\r\nsuccess and feeble applause.\r\n\r\nIf these reasonings be just, no poet has ever triumphed over greater\r\ndifficulties than Milton. He received a learned education: he was a\r\nprofound and elegant classical scholar: he had studied all the mysteries\r\nof Rabbinical literature: he was intimately acquainted with every\r\nlanguage of modern Europe, from which either pleasure or information was\r\nthen to be derived. He was perhaps the only great poet of later times\r\nwho has been distinguished by the excellence of his Latin verse. The\r\ngenius of Petrarch was scarcely of the first order; and his poems in the\r\nancient language, though much praised by those who have never read\r\nthem, are wretched compositions. Cowley, with all his admirable wit and\r\ningenuity, had little imagination: nor indeed do we think his classical\r\ndiction comparable to that of Milton. The authority of Johnson is\r\nagainst us on this point. But Johnson had studied {212}the bad writers\r\nof the middle ages till he had become utterly insensible to the Augustan\r\nelegance, and was as ill qualified to judge between two Latin styles as\r\na habitual drunkard to set up for a wine-taster.\r\n\r\nVersification in a dead language is an exotic, a farfetched, costly,\r\nsickly, imitation of that which elsewhere may be found in healthful and\r\nspontaneous perfection. The soils on which this rarity flourishes are in\r\ngeneral as ill suited to the production of vigorous native poetry as the\r\nflower-pots of a hot-house to the growth of oaks. That the author of\r\nthe Paradise Lost should have written the Epistle to Manso was truly\r\nwonderful. Never before were such marked originality and such exquisite\r\nmimicry found together. Indeed in all the Latin poems of Milton the\r\nartificial manner indispensable to such works is admirably preserved,\r\nwhile, at the same time, his genius gives to them a peculiar charm, an\r\nair of nobleness and freedom, which distinguishes them from all other\r\nwritings of the same class. They remind us of the amusements of those\r\nangelic warriors who composed the cohort of Gabriel:\r\n\r\n               “About him exercised heroic games\r\n\r\n               The unarmed youth of heaven. But o’er their heads\r\n\r\n               Celestial armoury, shield, helm, and spear,\r\n\r\n               Hung high, with diamond flaming and with gold.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot look upon the sportive exercises for which the genius of\r\nMilton ungirds itself, without catching la glimpse of the gorgeous and\r\nterrible panoply which it is accustomed to wear. The strength of his\r\nimagination triumphed over every obstacle. So intense and ardent was the\r\nfire of his mind, that it not only was not suffocated beneath the weight\r\nof fuel, but penetrated the whole superincumbent mass with its own heat\r\nand radiance. {213}It is not our intention to attempt any thing like a\r\ncomplete examination of the poetry of Milton. The public has long been\r\nagreed as to the merit of the most remarkable passages, the incomparable\r\nharmony of the numbers, and the excellence of that style, which no rival\r\nhas been able to equal, and no parodist to degrade, which displays In\r\ntheir highest perfection the idiomatic powers of the English tongue,\r\nand to which every ancient and every modern language has contributed\r\nsomething of grace, of energy, or of music. In the vast field of\r\ncriticism on which we are entering, innumerable reapers have already put\r\ntheir sickles. Yet the harvest is so abundant that the negligent search\r\nof a straggling gleaner may be rewarded with a sheaf.\r\n\r\nThe most striking characteristic of the poetry of Milton is the extreme\r\nremoteness of the associations by means of which it acts on the reader.\r\nIts effect is produced, not so much by what it expresses, as by what\r\nit suggests; not so much by the ideas which it directly conveys, as\r\nby other ideas which are connected with them. He electrifies the mind\r\nthrough conductors. The most unimaginative man must understand the\r\nIliad. Homer gives him no choice, and requires from him no exertion, but\r\ntakes the whole upon himself, and sets the images in so clear a light,\r\nthat it is impossible to be blind to them. The works of Milton cannot be\r\ncomprehended or enjoyed, unless the mind of the reader co-operate with\r\nthat of the writer. He does not paint a finished picture, or play for\r\na mere passive listener. He sketches, and leaves others to fill up the\r\noutline. He strikes the key-note, and expects his hearer to make out the\r\nmelody.\r\n\r\nWe often hear of the magical influence of poetry. The expression in\r\ngeneral means nothing: but applied {214}to the writings of Milton, it\r\nis most appropriate. His poetry acts like an incantation. Its merit lies\r\nless in its obvious meaning than in its occult power. There would seem,\r\nat first sight, to be no more in his words than in other words. But they\r\nare words of enchantment. No sooner are they pronounced, than the past\r\nis present and the distant near. New forms of beauty start at once into\r\nexistence, and all the burial-places of the memory give up their dead.\r\nChange the structure of the sentence; substitute one synonyme for\r\nanother, and the whole effect is destroyed. The spell loses its power;\r\nand he who should then hope to conjure with it would find himself as\r\nmuch mistaken as Cassim in the Arabian tale, when he stood crying, “Open\r\nWheat,” “Open Barley,” to the door which obeyed no sound but “Open\r\nSesame.” The miserable failure of Dryden in his attempt to translate\r\ninto his own diction some parts of the Paradise Lost, is a remarkable\r\ninstance of this.\r\n\r\nIn support of these observations we may remark, that scarcely any\r\npassages in the poems of Milton are more generally known or more\r\nfrequently repeated than those which are little more than muster-rolls\r\nof names. They are not always more appropriate or more melodious than\r\nother names. But they are charmed names. Every one of them is the first\r\nlink in a long chain of associated ideas. Like the dwelling-place of our\r\ninfancy revisited in manhood, like the song of our country heard in a\r\nstrange land, they produce upon us an effect wholly independent of their\r\nintrinsic value. One transports us back to a remote period of history.\r\nAnother places us among the novel scenes and manners of a distant\r\nregion. A third evokes all the dear classical recollection of childhood,\r\nthe school-room, {215}the dog-eared Virgil, the holiday, and the prize.\r\nA fourth brings before us the splendid phantoms of chivalrous romance,\r\nthe trophied lists, the embroidered housings, the quaint devices, the\r\nhaunted forests, the enchanted gardens, the achievements of enamoured\r\nknights, and the smiles of rescued princesses.\r\n\r\nIn none of the works of Milton is his peculiar manner more happily\r\ndisplayed than in the Allegro and the Penseroso. It is impossible\r\nto conceive that the mechanism of language can be brought to a more\r\nexquisite degree of perfection. These poems differ from others, as atar\r\nof roses differs from ordinary rose water, the close packed essence\r\nfrom the thin diluted mixture. They are indeed not so much poems, as\r\ncollections of hints, from each of which the reader is to make out a\r\npoem for himself. Every epithet is a text for a stanza.\r\n\r\nThe Comus and the Sampson Agonistes are works which, though of very\r\ndifferent merit, offer some marked points of resemblance. Both are\r\nlyric poems in the form of plays. There are perhaps no two kinds of\r\ncomposition so essentially dissimilar as the drama and the ode. The\r\nbusiness of the dramatist is to keep himself out of sight, and to let\r\nnothing appear but his characters. As soon as he attracts notice to his\r\npersonal feelings, the illusion is broken. The effect is as unpleasant\r\nas that which is produced on the stage by the voice of a prompter or the\r\nentrance of a scene-shifter. Hence it was, that the tragedies of Byron\r\nwere his least successful performances. They resemble those pasteboard\r\npictures invented by the friend of children, Mr. Newbery, in which a\r\nsingle moveable head goes round twenty different bodies, so that the\r\nsame face looks out upon us successively, from the uniform of a\r\nhussar, the furs of a judge, and the rags of a beggar. {216}In all the\r\ncharacters, patriots and tyrants, haters and lovers, the frown and sneer\r\nof Harold were discernible in an instant. But this species of egotism,\r\nthough fatal to the drama, is the inspiration of the ode. It is the\r\npart of the lyric poet to abandon himself, without reserve, to his own\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\nBetween these hostile elements many great men have endeavoured to effect\r\nan amalgamation, but never with complete success. The Greek Drama, on\r\nthe model of which the Samson was written, sprang from the Ode. The\r\ndialogue was ingrafted on the chorus, and naturally partook of its\r\ncharacter. The genius of the greatest of the Athenian dramatists\r\nco-operated with the circumstances under which tragedy made its first\r\nappearance. Æschylus was, head and heart, a lyric poet. In his time, the\r\nGreeks had far more intercourse with the East than in the days of\r\nHomer; and they had not yet acquired that immense superiority in war, in\r\nscience, and in the arts, which, in the following generation, led them\r\nto treat the Asiatics with contempt. From the narrative of Herodotus it\r\nshould seem that they still looked up, with the veneration of disciples,\r\nto Egypt and Assyria. At this period, accordingly, it was natural that\r\nthe literature of Greece should be tinctured with the Oriental style.\r\nAnd that style, we think, is discernible in the works of Pindar and\r\nÆschylus. The latter often reminds us of the Hebrew writers. The book of\r\nJob, indeed, in conduct and diction, bears a considerable resemblance\r\nto some of his dramas. Considered as plays, his works are absurd;\r\nconsidered as choruses, they are above all praise. If, for instance, we\r\nexamine the address of Clytemnestra to Agamemnon on his return, or the\r\ndescription of the seven Argive chiefs, by the principles of dramatic\r\n{217}writing, we shall instantly condemn them as monstrous. But if we\r\nforget the characters, and think only of the poetry, we shall admit that\r\nit has never been surpassed in energy and magnificence. Sophocles made\r\nthe Greek drama as dramatic as was consistent with its original form.\r\nHis portraits of men have a sort of similarity; but it is the similarity\r\nnot of a painting, but of a bas-relief. It suggests a resemblance; but\r\nit does not produce an illusion. Euripides attempted to carry the reform\r\nfurther. But it was a task far beyond his powers, perhaps beyond any\r\npowers. Instead of correcting what was bad, he destroyed what was\r\nexcellent. He substituted crutches for stilts, bad sermons for good\r\nodes.\r\n\r\nMilton, it is well known, admired Euripides highly, much more highly\r\nthan, in our opinion, Euripides deserved. Indeed the caresses which\r\nthis partiality leads our countryman to bestow on “sad Electra’s poet,”\r\n sometimes remind us of the beautiful Queen of Fairy-land kissing the\r\nlong ears of Bottom. At all events, there can be no doubt that this\r\nveneration for the Athenian, whether just or not, was injurious to the\r\nSamson Agonistes. Had Milton taken Æschylus for his model, he would have\r\ngiven himself up to the lyric inspiration, and poured out profusely all\r\nthe treasures of his mind, without bestowing a thought on those dramatic\r\nproprieties which the nature of the work rendered it impossible to\r\npreserve. In the attempt to reconcile things in their own nature\r\ninconsistent, he has failed, as every one else must have failed. We\r\ncannot identify ourselves with the characters, as in a good play.\r\nWe cannot identify ourselves with the poet, as in a good ode. The\r\nconflicting ingredients, like an acid and an alkali mixed, neutralise\r\neach other. {218}We are by no means insensible to the merits of this\r\ncelebrated piece, to the severe dignity of the style, the graceful\r\nand pathetic solemnity of the opening speech, or the wild and barbaric\r\nmelody which gives so striking an effect to the choral passages. But\r\nwe think it, we confess, the least successful effort of the genius of\r\nMilton.\r\n\r\nThe Comus is framed on the model of the Italian Masque, as the Samson\r\nis framed on the model of the Greek Tragedy. It is certainly the noblest\r\nperformance of the kind which exists in any language. It is as far\r\nsuperior to the Faithful Shepherdess, as the Faithful Shepherdess is\r\nto the Aminta, or the Aminta to the Pastor Fido. It was well for Milton\r\nthat he had here no Euripides to mislead him. He understood and loved\r\nthe literature of modern Italy. But he did not feel for it the same\r\nveneration which he entertained for the remains of Athenian and Roman\r\npoetry, consecrated by so many lofty and endearing recollections. The\r\nfaults, moreover, of his Italian predecessors were of a kind to which\r\nhis mind had a deadly antipathy. He could stoop to a plain style,\r\nsometimes even to a bald style; but false brilliancy was his utter\r\naversion. His muse had no objection to a russet attire; but she turned\r\nwith disgust from the finery of Guarini, as tawdry and as paltry as the\r\nrags of a chimney-sweeper on May-day. Whatever ornaments she wears are\r\nof massive gold, not only dazzling to the sight, but capable of standing\r\nthe severest test of the crucible.\r\n\r\nMilton attended in the Comus to the distinction which he afterwards\r\nneglected in the Samson. He made his Masque what it ought to be,\r\nessentially lyrical, and dramatic only in semblance. He has not\r\n{219}attempted a fruitless struggle against a defect inherent In the\r\nnature of that species of composition; and he has therefore succeeded,\r\nwherever success was not impossible. The speeches must be read as\r\nmajestic soliloquies; and he who so reads them will be enraptured with\r\ntheir eloquence, their sublimity, and their music. The interruptions of\r\nthe dialogue, however, impose a constraint upon the writer, and break\r\nthe illusion of the reader. The finest passages are those which are\r\nlyric in form as well as in spirit. “I should much commend,” says the\r\nexcellent Sir Henry Wotton in a letter to Milton, “the tragical part if\r\nthe lyrical did not ravish me with a certain Dorique delicacy in your\r\nsongs and odes, whereunto, I must plainly confess to you, I have seen\r\nyet nothing parallel in our language.” The criticism was just. It\r\nis when Milton escapes from the shackles of the dialogue, when he is\r\ndischarged from the labour of uniting two incongruous styles, when he is\r\nat liberty to indulge his choral raptures without reserve, that he rises\r\neven above himself. Then, like his own good Genius bursting from the\r\nearthly form and weeds of Thyrsis, he stands forth in celestial freedom\r\nand beauty; he seems to cry exultingly,\r\n\r\n                   “Now my task is smoothly done,\r\n\r\n                   I can fly or I can run,\"\r\n\r\nto skim the earth, to soar above the clouds, to bathe in the Elysian dew\r\nof the rainbow, and to inhale the balmy smells of nard and cassia, which\r\nthe musky winds of the zephyr scatter through the cedared alleys of the\r\nHesperides.\r\n\r\nThere are several of the minor poems of Milton on which we would\r\nwillingly make a few remarks. Still more willingly would we enter into a\r\ndetailed examination {220}of that admirable poem, the Paradise Regained,\r\nwhich, strangely enough, is scarcely ever mentioned except as an\r\ninstance of the blindness of the parental affection which men of letters\r\nbear towards the offspring of their intellects. That Milton was mistaken\r\nin preferring this work, excellent as it is, to the Paradise Lost, we\r\nreadily admit. But we are sure that the superiority of the Paradise Lost\r\nto the Paradise Regained is not more decided, than the superiority of\r\nthe Paradise Regained to every poem which has since made its appearance.\r\nOur limits, however, prevent us from discussing the point at length. We\r\nhasten on to that extraordinary production which the general suffrage of\r\ncritics has placed in the highest class of human compositions.\r\n\r\nThe only poem of modern times which can be compared with the Paradise\r\nLost is the Divine Comedy. The subject of Milton, in some points,\r\nresembled that of Dante; but he has treated it in a widely different\r\nmanner. We cannot, we think, better illustrate our opinion respecting\r\nour own great poet, than by contrasting him with the father of Tuscan\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThe poetry of Milton differs from that of Dante, as the hieroglyphics of\r\nEgypt differed from the picturewriting of Mexico. The images which Dante\r\nemploys speak for themselves; they stand simply for what they are. Those\r\nof Milton have a signification which is often discernible only to the\r\ninitiated. Their value depends less on what they directly represent than\r\non what they remotely suggest. However strange, however grotesque, may\r\nbe the appearance which Dante undertakes to describe, he never shrinks\r\nfrom describing it. He gives us the shape, the colour, the sound, the\r\nsmell, the taste; he counts the numbers; he measares {221}the size.\r\nHis similes are the illustrations of a traveller. Unlike those of\r\nother poets, and especially of Milton, they are introduced in a plain,\r\nbusiness-like manner; not for the sake of any beauty in the objects from\r\nwhich they are drawn; not for the sake of any ornament which they may\r\nimpart to the poem; but simply in order to make the meaning of the\r\nwriter as clear to the reader as it is to himself. The ruins of the\r\nprecipice which led from the sixth to the seventh circle of hell were\r\nlike those of the rock which fell into the Adige on the south of Trent.\r\nThe cataract of Phlegethon was like that of Aqua Cheta at the monastery\r\nof St. Benedict. The place where the heretics were confined in burning\r\ntombs resembled the vast cemetery of Arles.\r\n\r\nNow let us compare with the exact details of Dante the dim intimations\r\nof Milton. We will cite a few examples. The English poet has never\r\nthought of taking the measure of Satan. He gives us merely a vague\r\nidea of vast bulk. In one passage the fiend lies stretched out huge in\r\nlength, floating many a rood, equal in size to the earth-born enemies\r\nof Jove, or to the sea-monster which the mariner mistakes for an island.\r\nWhen he addresses himself to battle against the guardian angels, he\r\nstands like Teneriffe or Atlas: his stature reaches the sky. Contrast\r\nwith these descriptions the lines in which Dante has described the\r\ngigantic spectre of Nimrod. “His face seemed to me as long and as\r\nbroad as the ball of St. Peter’s at Rome; and his other limbs were\r\nin proportion; so that the bank, which concealed him from the waist\r\ndownwards, nevertheless showed so much of him, that three tall Germans\r\nwould in vain have attempted to reach to his hair.” We are sensible that\r\nwe do no {222}justice to the admirable style of the Florentine poet. But\r\nMr. Cary’s translation is not at hand; and our version, however rude, is\r\nsufficient to illustrate our meaning.\r\n\r\nOnce more, compare the lazar-house in the eleventh book of the Paradise\r\nLost with the last ward of Malebolge in Dante. Milton avoids the\r\nloathsome details, and takes refuge in indistinct but solemn and\r\ntremendous imagery, Despair hurrying from couch to couch to mock the\r\nwretches with his attendance, Death shaking his dart over them, but, in\r\nspite of supplications, delaying to strike. What says Dante? “There was\r\nsuch a moan there as there would be if all the sick who, between July\r\nand September, are in the hospitals of Valdichiana, and of the Tuscan\r\nswamps, and of Sardinia, were in one pit together; and such a stench was\r\nissuing forth as is wont to issue from decayed limbs.”\r\n\r\nWe will not take upon ourselves the invidious office of settling\r\nprecedency between two such writers. Each in his own department is\r\nincomparable; and each, we may remark, has wisely, or fortunately,\r\ntaken a subject adapted to exhibit his peculiar talent to the greatest\r\nadvantage. The Divine Comedy is a personal narrative. Dante is the\r\neye-witness and ear-witness of that which he relates. He is the very man\r\nwho has heard the tormented spirits crying out for the second death,\r\nwho has read the dusky characters on the portal within which there is\r\nno hope, who has hidden his face from the terrors of the Gorgon, who\r\nhas fled from the hooks and the seething pitch of Barbariccia and\r\nDrag-hignazzo. His own hands have grasped the shaggy sides of Lucifer.\r\nHis own feet have climbed the mountain of expiation. His own brow has\r\nbeen {223}marked by the purifying angel. The reader would throw aside\r\nsuch a tale in incredulous disgust, unless it were told with the\r\nstrongest air of veracity, with a sobriety even in its horrors, with\r\nthe greatest precision and multiplicity in its details. The narrative of\r\nMilton in this respect differs from that of Dante, as the adventures of\r\nAmadis differ from those of Gulliver. The author of Amadis would have\r\nmade his book ridiculous if he had introduced those minute particulars\r\nwhich give such a charm to the work of Swift, the nautical observations,\r\nthe affected delicacy about names, the official documents transcribed\r\nat foil length, and all the unmeaning gossip and scandal of the court,\r\nspringing out of nothing, and tending to nothing. We are not shocked\r\nat being told that a man who lived, nobody knows when, saw many very\r\nstrange sights, and we can easily abandon ourselves to the illusion of\r\nthe romance. But when Lemuel Gulliver, surgeon, resident at Rotherhithe,\r\ntells us of pygmies and giants, flying islands, and philosophising\r\nhorses, nothing but such circumstantial touches could produce for a\r\nsingle moment a deception on the imagination.\r\n\r\nOf all the poets who have introduced into their works the agency of\r\nsupernatural beings, Milton has succeeded best. Here Dante decidedly\r\nyields to him: and as this is a point on which many rash and\r\nill-considered judgments have been pronounced, we feel inclined to dwell\r\non it a little longer. The most fatal error which a poet can possibly\r\ncommit in the management of his machinery, is that of attempting to\r\nphilosophise too much. Milton has been often censured for ascribing to\r\nspirits many functions of which spirits must be incapable. But these\r\nobjections, though sanctioned by eminent names, originate, we venture\r\nto say, in profound ignorance of the art of poetry. {224}What is spirit?\r\nWhat are our own minds, the portion of spirit with which we are best\r\nacquainted? We observe certain phænomena. We cannot explain them into\r\nmaterial causes. We therefore infer that there exists something which\r\nis not material. But of this something we have no idea. We can define\r\nit only in negatives. We can reason about it only by symbols. We use the\r\nword: but we have no more of the things; and the business of poetry\r\nis with images, and not with words. The poet uses words indeed; but they\r\nare merely the instruments of his art, not its objects. They are the\r\nmaterials which he is to dispose in such a manner as to present a\r\npicture to the mental eye. And if they are not so disposed, they are\r\nno more entitled to be called poetry than a bale of canvas and a box of\r\ncolours to be called a painting.\r\n\r\nLogicians may reason about abstractions. But the great mass of men\r\nmust have images. The strong tendency of the multitude in all a^es and\r\nnations to idolatry can be explained on no other principle. The first\r\ninhabitants of Greece, there is reason to believe, worshipped one\r\ninvisible Deity. But the necessity of having something more definite to\r\nadore produced, in a few centuries, the innumerable crowd of Gods and\r\nGoddesses. In like manner the ancient Persians thought it impious to\r\nexhibit the Creator under a human form. Yet even these transferred to\r\nthe Sun the worship which, in speculation, they considered due only to\r\nthe Supreme Mind. The History of the Jews is the record of a continued\r\nstruggle between pure Theism, supported by the most terrible sanctions,\r\nand the strangely fascinating desire of having some visible and tangible\r\nobject of adoration. Perhaps none of the secondary causes which Gibbon\r\nhas assigned for the rapidity with which Christianity spread over the\r\nworld, {225}while Judaism scarcely ever acquired a proselyte,\r\noperated more powerfully than this feeling. God, the uncreated,\r\nthe incomprehensible, the invisible, attracted few worshippers. A\r\nphilosopher might admire so noble a conception: but the crowd turned\r\naway in disgust from words which presented no image to their minds. It\r\nwas before Deity embodied in a human form, walking among men, partaking\r\nof their infirmities, leaning on their bosoms, weeping over their\r\ngraves, slumbering in the manger, bleeding on the cross, that the\r\nprejudices of the Synagogue, and the doubts of the Academy, and the\r\npride of the portico, and the fasces of the Lictor, and the swords of\r\nthirty legions, were humbled in the dust. Soon after Christianity had\r\nachieved its triumph, the principle which had assisted it began to\r\ncorrupt it. It became a new Paganism. Patron saints assumed the offices\r\nof household gods. St. George took the place of Mars. St. Elmo consoled\r\nthe mariner for the loss of Castor and Pollux. The Virgin Mother and\r\nCecilia succeeded to Venus and the Muses. The fascination of sex and\r\nloveliness was again joined to that of celestial dignity; and the homage\r\nof chivalry was blended with that of religion. Reformers have often made\r\na stand against these feelings; but never with more than apparent and\r\npartial success. The men who demolished the images in Cathedrals have\r\nnot always been able to demolish those which were enshrined in their\r\nminds. It would not be difficult to show that in politics the same rule\r\nholds good. Doctrines, we are afraid, must generally be embodied before\r\nthey can excite a strong public feeling. The multitude is more easily\r\ninterested for the most unmeaning badge, or the most insignificant name,\r\nthan for the most important principle. {226}From these considerations,\r\nwe infer that no poet, who should affect that metaphysical accuracy for\r\nthe want of which Milton has been blamed, would escape a disgraceful\r\nfailure. Still, however, there was another extreme, which, though far\r\nless dangerous, was also to be avoided. The imaginations of men are in\r\na groat measure under the control of their opinions. The most exquisite\r\nart of poetical colouring can produce no illusion, when it is employed\r\nto represent that which is at once perceived to be incongruous and\r\nabsurd. Milton wrote in an age of philosophers and theologians. It was\r\nnecessary, therefore, for him to abstain from giving such a shock to\r\ntheir understandings as might break the charm which it was his object\r\nto throw over their imaginations. This is the real explanation of\r\nthe indistinctness and inconsistency with which he has often been\r\nreproached. Dr. Johnson acknowledges that it was absolutely necessary\r\nthat the spirit should be clothed with material forms. “But,” says he,\r\n“the poet should have secured the consistency of his system by keeping\r\nimmateriality out of sight, and seducing the reader to drop it from his\r\nthoughts.” This is easily said; but what if Milton could not seduce his\r\nreaders to drop immateriality from their thoughts? What if the contrary\r\nopinion had taken so full a possession of the minds of men as to leave\r\nno room even for the half belief which poetry requires? Such we\r\nsuspect to have been the case. It was impossible for the poet to adopt\r\naltogether the material or the immaterial system. He therefore took his\r\nstand on the debatable ground. He left the whole in ambiguity. He\r\nhas, doubtless, by so doing, laid himself open to the charge of\r\ninconsistency. But, though philosophically in the wrong, we cannot\r\nbut believe that he was poetically {227}in the right. This task, which\r\nalmost any other writer would have found impracticable, was easy to\r\nhim. The peculiar art which he possessed of communicating his meaning\r\ncircuitously through a long succession of associated ideas, and of\r\nintimating more than he expressed, enabled him to disguise those\r\nincongruities which he could not avoid.\r\n\r\nPoetry which relates to the beings of another world ought to be at\r\nonce mysterious and picturesque. That of Milton is so. That of Dante\r\nis picturesque indeed beyond any that ever was written. Its effect\r\napproaches to that produced by the pencil or the chisel. But it is\r\npicturesque to the exclusion of all mystery. This is a fault on the\r\nright side, a fault inseparable from the plan of Dante’s poem, which,\r\nas we have already observed, rendered the utmost accuracy of description\r\nnecessary. Still it is a fault. The supernatural agents excite an\r\ninterest; but it is not the interest which is proper to supernatural\r\nagents. We feel that we could talk to the ghosts and dæmons without any\r\nemotion of unearthly awe. We could, like Don Juan, ask them to supper,\r\nand eat heartily in their company. Dante’s angels are good men with\r\nwings. His devils are spiteful ugly executioners. His dead men are\r\nmerely living men in strange situations. The scene which passes between\r\nthe poet and Farinata is justly celebrated. Still, Farinata in the\r\nburning tomb is exactly what Farinata would have been at an _auto da\r\nfe_. Nothing can be more touching than the first interview of Dante and\r\nBeatrice. Yet what is it, but a lovely woman chiding, with sweet austere\r\ncomposure, the lover for whose affection she is grateful, but whose\r\nvices she reprobates? The feelings which give the passage its charm\r\nwould suit the streets of {228}Florence as well as the summit of the\r\nMount of Purgatory.\r\n\r\nThe spirits of Milton are unlike those of almost all other writers.\r\nHis fiends, in particular, are wonderful creations. They are not\r\nmetaphysical abstractions. They are not wicked men. They are not ugly\r\nbeasts. They have no horns, no tails, none of the fee-faw-fum of Tasso\r\nand Klopstock. They have just enough in common with human nature to be\r\nintelligible to human beings. Their characters are, like their forms,\r\nmarked by a certain dim resemblance to those of men, but exaggerated to\r\ngigantic dimensions, and veiled in mysterious gloom.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the gods and dæmons of Æschylus may best bear a comparison with\r\nthe angels and devils of Milton. The style of the Athenian had, as\r\nwe have remarked, something of the Oriental character; and the same\r\npeculiarity may be traced in his mythology. It has nothing of the\r\namenity and elegance which we generally find in the superstitions of\r\nGreece. All is rugged, barbaric, and colossal. The legends of Æschylus\r\nseem to harmonize less with the fragrant groves and graceful porticoes\r\nin which his countrymen paid their vows to the God of Light and Goddess\r\nof Desire, than with those huge and grotesque labyrinths of eternal\r\ngranite in which Egypt enshrined her mystic Osiris, or in which\r\nHindostan still bows down to her seven-headed idols. His favourite\r\ngods are those of the elder generation, the sons of heaven and earth,\r\ncompared with whom Jupiter himself was a stripling and an upstart, the\r\ngigantic Titans, and the inexorable Furies. Foremost among his creations\r\nof this class stands Prometheus, half fiend, half redeemer, the friend\r\nof man, the sullen and implacable enemy of heaven. Prometheus {229}bears\r\nundoubtedly a considerable resemblance, to the Satan of Milton. In both\r\nwe find the same impatience of control, the same ferocity, the same\r\nunconquerable pride. In both characters also are mingled, though in\r\nvery different proportions, some kind and generous feelings. Prometheus,\r\nhowever, is hardly superhuman enough. He talks too much of his chains\r\nand his uneasy posture: he is rather too much depressed and agitated.\r\nHis resolution seems to depend on the knowledge which he possesses that\r\nhe holds the fate of his torturer in his hands, and that the hour of his\r\nrelease will surely come. But Satan is a creature of another sphere.\r\nThe might of his intellectual nature is victorious over the extremity\r\nof pain. Amidst agonies which cannot be conceived without horror, he\r\ndeliberates, resolves, and even exults. Against the sword of Michael,\r\nagainst the thunder of Jehovah, against the flaming lake, and the\r\nmarl burning with solid fire, against the prospect of an eternity of\r\nunintermitted misery, his spirit bears up unbroken, resting on its own\r\ninnate energies, requiring no support from any thing external, nor even\r\nfrom hope itself.\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to the parallel which we have been attempting\r\nto draw between Milton and Dante, we would add that the poetry of these\r\ngreat men has in a considerable degree taken its character from their\r\nmoral qualities. They are not egotists. They rarely obtrude their\r\nidiosyncrasies on their readers. They have, nothing in common with those\r\nmodern beggars for fame, who extort a pittance from the compassion of\r\nthe inexperienced by exposing the nakedness and sores of their minds.\r\nYet it would be difficult to name two writers whose works have been more\r\ncompletely, though undesignedly, coloured by their personal feelings.\r\n{230}The character of Milton was peculiarly distinguished by loftiness\r\nof spirit; that of Dante by intensity of feeling. In every line of\r\nthe Divine Comedy we discern the asperity which is produced by pride\r\nstruggling with misery. There is perhaps no work in the world so deeply\r\nand uniformly sorrowful. The melancholy of Dante was no fantastic\r\ncaprice. It was not, as far as at this distance of time can be judged,\r\nthe effect of external circumstances. It was from within. Neither love\r\nnor glory, neither the conflicts of earth nor the hope of heaven could\r\ndispel it. It turned every consolation and every pleasure into its own\r\nnature. It resembled that noxious Sardinian soil of which the intense\r\nbitterness is said to have been perceptible even in its honey. His mind\r\nwas, in the noble language of the Hebrew poet, “a land of darkness, as\r\ndarkness itself, and where the light was as darkness.” The gloom of\r\nhis character discolours all the passions of men, and all the face of\r\nnature, and tinges with its own livid hue the flowers of Paradise\r\nand the glories of the eternal throne. All the portraits of him are\r\nsingularly characteristic. No person can look on the features, noble\r\neven to ruggedness, the dark furrows of the cheek, the haggard and woful\r\nstare of the eye, the sullen and contemptuous curve of the lip, and\r\ndoubt that they belong to a man too proud and too sensitive to be happy.\r\n\r\nMilton was, like Dante, a statesman and a lover; and, like Dante, he had\r\nbeen unfortunate in ambition and in love. He had survived his health and\r\nhis sight, the comforts of his home, and the prosperity of his party.\r\nOf the great men by whom he had been distinguished at his entrance into\r\nlife, some had been taken away from the evil to come; some had carried\r\ninto foreign climates their unconquerable hatred of oppression;\r\n{231}some were pining in dungeons; and some had poured forth their blood\r\non scaffolds. Venal and licentious scribblers, with just sufficient\r\ntalent to clothe the thoughts of a pandar in the style of a bellman,\r\nwere now the favourite writers of the Sovereign and of the public. It\r\nwas a loathsome herd, which could be compared to nothing so fitly as\r\nto the rabble of Cornus, grotesque monsters, half bestial half human,\r\ndropping with wine, bloated with gluttony, and reeling in obscene\r\ndances. Amidst these that fair Muse was placed, like the chaste lady of\r\nthe Masque, lofty, spotless, and serene, to be chattered at, and pointed\r\nat, and grinned at, by the whole rout of Satyrs and Goblins. If ever\r\ndespondency and asperity could be excused in any man, they might have\r\nbeen excused in Milton. But the strength of his mind overcame every\r\ncalamity. Neither blindness, nor gout, nor age, nor penury, nor domestic\r\nafflictions, nor political disappointments, nor abuse, nor proscription,\r\nnor neglect, had power to disturb his sedate and majestic patience. His\r\nspirits do not seem to have been high, but they were singularly equable.\r\nHis temper was serious, perhaps stern; but it was a temper which no\r\nsufferings could render sullen or fretful. Such as it was when, on\r\nthe eve of great events, he returned from his travels, in the prime of\r\nhealth and manly beauty, loaded with literary distinctions, and glowing\r\nwith patriotic hopes, such it continued to be when, after having\r\nexperienced every calamity which is incident to our nature, old, poor,\r\nsightless and disgraced, he retired to his hovel to die.\r\n\r\nHence it was that, though he wrote the Paradise Lost at a time of life\r\nwhen images of beauty and tenderness are in general beginning to\r\nfade, even from those minds in which they have not been effaced by\r\n{232}anxiety and disappointment, he adorned it with all that is most\r\nlovely and delightful in the physical and in the moral world. Neither\r\nTheocritus nor Ariosto had a finer or a more healthful sense of the\r\npleasantness of external objects, or loved better to luxuriate amidst\r\nsunbeams and flowers, the songs of nightingales, the juice of summer\r\nfruits, and the coolness of shady fountains. His conception of love\r\nunites all the voluptuousness of the Oriental harem, and all the\r\ngallantry of the chivalric tournament, with all the pure and quiet\r\naffection of an English fireside. His poetry reminds us of the miracles\r\nof Alpine scenery. Nooks and dells, beautiful as fairy land, are\r\nembosomed in its most rugged and gigantic elevations. The roses and\r\nmyrtles bloom unchilled on the verge of the avalanche.\r\n\r\nTraces, indeed, of the peculiar character of Milton may be found in\r\nall his works; but it is most strongly displayed in the Sonnets.\r\nThose remarkable poems have been undervalued by critics who have not\r\nunderstood their nature. They have no epigrammatic point. There is\r\nnone of the ingenuity of Filicaja in the thought, none of the hard and\r\nbrilliant enamel of Petrarch in the style. They are simple but majestic\r\nrecords of the feelings of the poet; as little tricked out for the\r\npublic eye as his diary would have been. A victory, an expected attack\r\nupon the city, a momentary fit of depression or exultation, a jest\r\nthrown out against one of his books, a dream which for a short time\r\nrestored to him that beautiful face over which the grave had closed for\r\never, led him to musings, which, without effort, shaped themselves into\r\nverse. The unity of sentiment and severity of style which characterise\r\nthese little pieces remind us of the Greek Anthology, or perhaps still\r\nmore of the Collects of the {233}English Liturgy. The noble poem on the\r\nMassacres of Piedmont is strictly a Collect in verse.\r\n\r\nThe Sonnets are more or less striking, according as the occasions which\r\ngave birth to them are more or less interesting. But they are, almost\r\nwithout exception, dignified by a sobriety and greatness of mind to\r\nwhich we know not where to look for a parallel. It would, indeed, be\r\nscarcely safe to draw any decided inferences as to the character of a\r\nwriter from passages directly egotistical. But the qualities which we\r\nhave ascribed to Milton, though perhaps most strongly marked in\r\nthose parts of his works which treat of his personal feelings, are\r\ndistinguishable in every page, and impart to all his writings, prose and\r\npoetry, English, Latin, and Italian, a strong family likeness.\r\n\r\nHis public conduct was such as was to be expected from a man of a spirit\r\nso high and of an intellect so powerful. He lived at one of the most\r\nmemorable eras in the history of mankind, at the very crisis of the\r\ngreat conflict between Oromasdes and Arimanes, liberty and despotism,\r\nreason and prejudice. That great battle was fought for no single\r\ngeneration, for no single land. The destinies of the human race were\r\nstaked on the same cast with the freedom of the English people. Then\r\nwere first proclaimed those mighty principles which have since worked\r\ntheir way into the depths of the American forests, which have roused\r\nGreece from the slavery and degradation of two thousand years, and\r\nwhich, from one end of Europe to the other, have kindled an unquenchable\r\nfire in the hearts of the oppressed, and loosed the knees of the\r\noppressors with an unwonted fear.\r\n\r\nOf those principles, then struggling for their infant existence, Milton\r\nwas the most devoted and eloquent literary {234}champion. We need not\r\nsay how much we admire his public conduct. But we cannot disguise\r\nfrom ourselves that a large portion of his countrymen still think it\r\nunjustifiable. The civil war, indeed, has been more discussed, and\r\nis less understood, than any event in English history. The friends of\r\nliberty laboured under the disadvantage of which the lion in the fable\r\ncomplained so bitterly. Though they were the conquerors, their enemies\r\nwere the painters. As a body, the Roundheads had done their utmost to\r\ndecry and ruin literature; and literature was even with them, as, in the\r\nlong run, it always is with its enemies. The best book on their side of\r\nthe question is the charming narrative of Mrs. Hutchinson. May’s History\r\nof the Parliament is good; but it breaks off at the most interesting\r\ncrisis of the struggle. The performance of Ludlow is foolish and\r\nviolent; and most of the later writers who have espoused the same cause,\r\nOldmixon for instance, and Catherine Macaulay, have, to say the least,\r\nbeen more distinguished by zeal than either by candour or by skill.\r\nOn the other side are the most authoritative and the most popular\r\nhistorical works in our language, that of Clarendon, and that of Hume.\r\nThe former is not only ably written and full of valuable information,\r\nbut has also an air of dignity and sincerity which makes even the\r\nprejudices and errors with which it abounds respectable. Hume, from\r\nwhose fascinating narrative the great mass of the reading public are\r\nstill contented to take their opinions, hated religion so much that he\r\nhated liberty for having been allied with religion, and has pleaded the\r\ncause of tyranny with the dexterity of an advocate while affecting the\r\nimpartiality of a judge.\r\n\r\nThe public conduct of Milton must be approved or {235}condemned\r\naccording as the resistance of the people to Charles the First shall\r\nappear to be justifiable or criminal. We shall therefore make no apology\r\nfor dedicating a few pages to the discussion of that interesting and\r\nmost important question. We shall not argue it on general grounds. We\r\nshall not recur to those primary principles from which the claim of any\r\ngovernment to the obedience of its subjects is to be deduced. We are\r\nentitled to that vantage ground; but we will relinquish it. We are, on\r\nthis point, so confident of superiority, that we are not unwilling to\r\nimitate the ostentatious generosity of those ancient knights, who vowed\r\nto joust without helmet or shield against all enemies, and to give\r\ntheir antagonists the advantage of sun and wind. We will take the naked\r\nconstitutional question. We confidently affirm, that every reason which\r\ncan be urged in favour of the Revolution of 1688 may be urged with at\r\nleast equal force in favour of what is called the Great Rebellion.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, only, we think, can the warmest admirers of Charles\r\nventure to say that he was a better sovereign than his son. He was not,\r\nin name and profession, a Papist; we say in name and profession, because\r\nboth Charles himself and his creature Laud, while they abjured the\r\ninnocent badges of Popery, retained all its worst vices, a complete\r\nsubjection of reason to authority, a weak preference of form to\r\nsubstance, a childish passion for mummeries, an idolatrous veneration\r\nfor the priestly character, and, above all, a merciless intolerance.\r\nThis, however, we waive. We will concede that Charles was a good\r\nProtestant; but we say that his Protestantism does not make the\r\nslightest distinction between his case and that of James.\r\n\r\nThe principles of the Revolution have often been {236}grossly\r\nmisrepresented, and never more than in the course of the present year.\r\nThere is a certain class of men, who, while they profess to hold in\r\nreverence the great names and great actions of former times never look\r\nat them for any other purpose than in order to find in them some excuse\r\nfor existing abuses. In every venerable precedent they pass by what is\r\nessential, and take only what is accidental: they keep out of sight what\r\nis beneficial, and hold up to public imitation all that is defective.\r\nIf, in any part of any great example, there be any thing unsound, these\r\nflesh-flies detect it with an unerring instinct, and dart upon it with\r\na ravenous delight. If some good end has been attained in spite of them,\r\nthey feel, with their prototype, that\r\n\r\n               “Their labour must be to pervert that end,\r\n\r\n               And out of good still to find means of evil.\"\r\n\r\nTo the blessings which England has derived from the Revolution these\r\npeople are utterly insensible. The expulsion of a tyrant, the solemn\r\nrecognition of popular rights, liberty, security, toleration, all go for\r\nnothing with them. One sect there was, which, from unfortunate temporary\r\ncauses, it was thought necessary to keep under close restraint. One part\r\nof the empire there was so unhappily circumstanced, that at that time\r\nits misery was necessary to our happiness, and its slavery to our\r\nfreedom. These are the parts of the Revolution which the politicians of\r\nwhom we speak, love to contemplate, and which seem to them not indeed\r\nto vindicate, but in some degree to palliate, the good which it has\r\nproduced. Talk to them of Naples, of Spain, or of South America. They\r\nstand forth zealots for the doctrine of Divine Right which has now come\r\nback to us, like a thief from transportation, {237}under the _alias_ of\r\nLegitimacy. But mention the miseries of Ireland. Then William is a\r\nhero. Then Somers and Shrewsbury are great men. Then the Revolution is a\r\nglorious era. The very same persons who, in this country, never omit an\r\nopportunity of reviving every wretched Jacobite slander respecting the\r\nWhigs of that period, have no sooner crossed St. George’s Channel, than\r\nthey begin to fill their bumpers to the glorious and immortal memory.\r\nThey may truly boast that they look not at men, but at measures. So that\r\nevil be done, they care not who does it; the arbitrary Charles, or the\r\nliberal William, Ferdinand the Catholic, or Frederic the Protestant. On\r\nsuch occasions their deadliest opponents may reckon upon their candid\r\nconstruction. The bold assertions of these people have of late impressed\r\na large portion of the public with an opinion that James the Second was\r\nexpelled simply because he was a Catholic, and that the Revolution was\r\nessentially a Protestant Revolution.\r\n\r\nBut this certainly was not the case; nor can any person who has acquired\r\nmore knowledge of the history of those times than is to be found in\r\nGoldsmith’s Abridgment believe that, if James had held his own religious\r\nopinions without wishing to make proselytes, or if, wishing even to\r\nmake proselytes, he had contented himself with exerting only his\r\nconstitutional influence for that purpose, the Prince of Orange would\r\never have been invited over. Our ancestors, we suppose, knew their own\r\nmeaning; and, if we may believe them, their hostility was primarily not\r\nto popery, but to tyranny. They did not drive out a tyrant because he\r\nwas a Catholic; but they excluded Catholics from the crown, because they\r\nthought them likely {238}to be tyrants. The ground on which they, in\r\ntheir famous resolution, declared the throne vacant, was this, “that\r\nJames had broken the fundamental laws of the kingdom.” Every man,\r\ntherefore, who approves of the Revolution of 1688 must hold that the\r\nbreach of fundamental laws on the part of the sovereign justifies\r\nresistance. The question, then, is this; Had Charles the First broken\r\nthe fundamental laws of England?\r\n\r\nNo person can answer in the negative, unless he refuses credit, not\r\nmerely to all the accusations brought against Charles by his opponents,\r\nbut to the narratives of the warmest Royalists, and to the confessions\r\nof the King himself. If there be any truth in any historian of any party\r\nwho has related the events of that reign, the conduct of Charles,\r\nfrom his accession to the meeting of the Long Parliament, had been a\r\ncontinued course of oppression and treachery. Let those who applaud\r\nthe Revolution, and condemn the Rebellion, mention one act of James\r\nthe Second to which a parallel is not to be found in the history of\r\nhis father. Let them lay their fingers on a single article in the\r\nDeclaration of Right, presented by the two Houses to William and Mary,\r\nwhich Charles is not acknowledged to have violated. He had, according\r\nto the testimony of his own friends, usurped the functions of the\r\nlegislature, raised taxes without the consent of parliament, and\r\nquartered troops on the people in the most illegal and vexatious\r\nmanner. Not a single session of parliament had passed without some\r\nunconstitutional attack on the freedom of debate; the right of petition\r\nwas grossly violated; arbitrary judgments, exorbitant fines, and\r\nunwarranted imprisonments, were grievances of daily occurrence. If these\r\nthings do not justify resistance, {239}the Revolution was treason; if\r\nthey do, the Great Rebellion was laudable.\r\n\r\nBut, it is said, why not adopt milder measures? Why, after the King\r\nhad consented to so many reforms, and renounced so many oppressive\r\nprerogatives, did the parliament continue to rise in their demands at\r\nthe risk of provoking a civil war? The ship-money had been given up.\r\nThe Star Chamber had been abolished. Provision had been made for the\r\nfrequent, convocation and secure deliberation of parliaments. Why not\r\npursue an end confessedly good by peaceable and regular means? We recur\r\nagain to the analogy of the Revolution. Why was James driven from the\r\nthrone? Why was he not retained upon conditions? He too had offered to\r\ncall a free parliament and to submit to its decision all the matters\r\nin dispute. Yet we are in the habit of praising our forefathers, who\r\npreferred a revolution, a disputed succession, a dynasty of strangers,\r\ntwenty years of foreign and intestine war, a standing army, and a\r\nnational debt, to the rule, however restricted, of a tried and proved\r\ntyrant. The Long Parliament acted on the same principle, and is entitled\r\nto the same praise. They could not trust the King. He had no doubt\r\npassed salutary laws; but what assurance was there that he would not\r\nbreak them? He had renounced oppressive prerogatives; but where was the\r\nsecurity that he would not resume them? The nation had to deal with a\r\nman whom no tie could bind, a man who made and broke promises with equal\r\nfacility, a man whose honour had been a hundred times pawned, and never\r\nredeemed.\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, the Long Parliament stands on still stronger ground\r\nthan the Convention of 1688. No action of James can be compared to the\r\nconduct of {240}Charles with respect to the Petition of Right. The Lords\r\nand Commons present him with a bill in which the constitutional limits\r\nof his power are marked out. He hesitates; he evades; at last he\r\nbargains to give his assent for five subsidies. The bill receives his\r\nsolemn assent; the subsidies are voted; but no sooner is the tyrant\r\nrelieved, than he returns at once to all the arbitrary measures which he\r\nhad bound himself to abandon, and violates all the clauses of the very\r\nAct which he had been paid to pass.\r\n\r\nFor more than ten years the people had seen the rights which were theirs\r\nby a double claim, by immemorial inheritance and by recent purchase,\r\ninfringed by the perfidious king who had recognised them. At length\r\ncircumstances compelled Charles to summon another parliament: another\r\nchance was given to our fathers: were they to throw it away as they had\r\nthrown away the former? Were they again to be cozened by le Roi le\r\nvent? Were they again to advance their money on pledges which had been\r\nforfeited over and over again? Were they to lay a second Petition of\r\nRight at the foot of the throne, to grant another lavish aid in exchange\r\nfor another unmeaning ceremony, and then to take their departure, till,\r\nafter ten years more of fraud and oppression, their prince should again\r\nrequire a supply, and again repay it with a perjury? They were compelled\r\nto choose whether they would trust a tyrant or conquer him. We think\r\nthat they chose wisely and nobly.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of Charles, like the advocates of other malefactors\r\nagainst whom overwhelming evidence is produced, generally decline\r\nall controversy about the facts, and content themselves with calling\r\ntestimony to character. He had so many private virtues! And {241}had\r\nJames the Second no private virtues? Was Oliver Cromwell, his bitterest\r\nenemies themselves being judges, destitute of private virtues? And what,\r\nafter all, are the virtues ascribed to Charles? A religious zeal, not\r\nmore sincere than that of his son, and fully as weak and narrow-minded,\r\nand a few of the ordinary household decencies which half the tombstones\r\nin England claim for those who lie beneath them. A good father! A\r\ngood husband! Ample apologies indeed for fifteen years of persecution,\r\ntyranny and falsehood!\r\n\r\nWe charge him with having broken his coronation oath; and we are told\r\nthat he kept his marriage vow! We accuse him of having given up\r\nhis people to the merciless inflictions of the most hot-headed and\r\nhard-hearted of prelates; and the defence is, that he took his little\r\nson on his knee and kissed him! We censure him for having violated the\r\narticles of the Petition of Right, after having, for good and valuable\r\nconsideration, promised to observe them; and we are informed that he was\r\naccustomed to hear prayers at six o’clock in the morning! It is to such\r\nconsiderations as these, together with his Vandyke dress, his handsome\r\nface, and his peaked beard, that he owes, we verily believe, most of his\r\npopularity with the present generation.\r\n\r\nFor ourselves, we own that we do not understand the common phrase, a\r\ngood man, but a bad king. We can as easily conceive a good man and an\r\nunnatural father, or a good man and a treacherous friend. We cannot,\r\nin estimating the character of an individual, leave out of our\r\nconsideration his conduct in the most important of all human relations;\r\nand if in that relation we find him to have been selfish, cruel, and\r\ndeceitful, we shall take the liberty to call him a bad {242}man, in\r\nspite of all his temperance at table, and all his regularity at chapel.\r\n\r\nWe cannot refrain from adding a few words respecting a topic on which\r\nthe defenders of Charles are fond of dwelling. If, they say, he governed\r\nhis people ill, he at least governed them after the example of his\r\npredecessors. If he violated their privileges, it was because those\r\nprivileges had not been accurately defined. No act of oppression has\r\never been imputed to him which has not a parallel in the annals of\r\nthe Tudors. This point Hume has laboured, with an art which is as\r\ndiscreditable in a historical work as it would be admirable in a\r\nforensic address. The answer is short, clear, and decisive. Charles\r\nhad assented to the Petition of Right. He had renounced the oppressive\r\npowers said to have been exercised by his predecessors, and he had\r\nrenounced them for money He was not entitled to set up his antiquated\r\nclaims against his own recent release.\r\n\r\nThese arguments are so obvious, that it may seem superfluous to dwell\r\nupon them. But those who have observed how much the events of that time\r\nare misrepresented and misunderstood will not blame us for stating\r\nthe case simply. It is a case of which the simplest statement is the\r\nstrongest.\r\n\r\nThe enemies of the Parliament, indeed, rarely choose to take issue on\r\nthe great points of the question. They content themselves with exposing\r\nsome of the crimes and follies to which public commotions necessarily\r\ngive birth. They bewail the unmerited fate of Stafford. They execrate\r\nthe lawless violence of the army. They laugh at the Scripitural names\r\nof the preachers. Major-generals fleecing their districts; soldiers\r\nrevelling on the spoils of a ruined peasantry; upstarts, enriched by\r\n{243}the public plunder, taking possession of the hospitable firesides\r\nand hereditary trees of the old gentry; boys smashing the beautiful\r\nwindows of cathedrals; Quakers riding naked through the market-place;\r\nFifth-monarchy men shouting for King Jesus; agitators lecturing from\r\nthe tops of tubs on the fate of Agag; all these, they tell us, were the\r\noffspring of the Great Rebellion.\r\n\r\nBe it so. We are not careful to answer in this matter. These charges,\r\nwere they infinitely more important, would not alter our opinion of\r\nan event which alone has made us to differ from the slaves who crouch\r\nbeneath despotic sceptres. Many evils, no doubt, were produced by the\r\ncivil war. They were the price of our liberty. Has the acquisition been\r\nworth the sacrifice? It is the nature of the Devil of tyranny to\r\ntear and rend the body which he leaves. Are the miseries of continued\r\npossession less horrible than the struggles of the tremendous exorcism?\r\n\r\nIf it were possible that a people brought up under an intolerant and\r\narbitrary system could subvert that system without acts of cruelty\r\nand folly, half the objections to despotic power would be removed.\r\nWe should, in that case, be compelled to acknowledge that it at least\r\nproduces no pernicious effects on the intellectual and moral character\r\nof a nation. We deplore the outrages which accompany revolutions.\r\nBut the more violent the outrages, the more assured we feel that a\r\nrevolution was necessary. The violence of those outrages will always\r\nbe proportioned to the ferocity and ignorance of the people; and\r\nthe ferocity and ignorance of the people will be proportioned to the\r\noppression and degradation under which they have been accustomed to\r\nlive. Thus it was in our civil war. The heads of the church and state\r\nreaped only that {244}which they had sown. The government had prohibited\r\nfree discussion: it had done its best to keep the people unacquainted\r\nwith their duties and their rights. The retribution was just and\r\nnatural. If our rulers suffered from popular ignorance, it was because\r\nthey had themselves taken away the key of knowledge. If they were\r\nassailed with blind fury, it was because they had exacted an equally\r\nblind submission.\r\n\r\nIt is the character of such revolutions that we always see the worst of\r\nthem at first. Till men have been some time free, they know not how to\r\nuse their freedom. The natives of wine countries are generally sober. In\r\nclimates where wine is a rarity intemperance abounds. A newly liberated\r\npeople may be compared to a northern army encamped on the Rhine or the\r\nXeres. It is said that, when soldiers in such a situation first\r\nfind themselves able to indulge without restraint in such a rare and\r\nexpensive luxury, nothing is to be seen but intoxication. Soon, however,\r\nplenty teaches discretion; and, after wine has been for a few months\r\ntheir daily fare, they become more temperate than they had ever been in\r\ntheir own country. In the same manner, the final and permanent fruits\r\nof liberty are wisdom, moderation, and mercy. Its immediate effects are\r\noften atrocious crimes, conflicting errors, scepticism on points the\r\nmost clear, dogmatism on points the most mysterious. It is just at\r\nthis crisis that its enemies love to exhibit it. They pull down the\r\nscaffolding from the half-finished edifice: they point to the flying\r\ndust, the falling bricks, the comfortless rooms, the frightful\r\nirregularity of the whole appearance; and then ask in scorn where\r\nthe promised splendour and comfort is to be found. If such miserable\r\nsophisms were to prevail there would never be a good house or a good\r\ngovernment in the world. {245}Ariosto tells a pretty story of a fairy,\r\nwho, by some mysterious law of her nature, was condemned to appear at\r\ncertain seasons in the form of a foul and poisonous snake. Those who\r\ninjured her during the period of her disguise were for ever excluded\r\nfrom participation in the blessings which she bestowed. But to those\r\nwho, in spite of her loathsome aspect, pitied and protected her, she\r\nafterwards revealed herself in the beautiful and celestial form which\r\nwas natural to her, accompanied their steps, granted all their wishes,\r\nfilled their houses with wealth, made them happy in love and victorious\r\nin war. Such a spirit is Liberty. At times she takes the form of a\r\nhateful reptile. She grovels, she hisses, she stings. But woe to those\r\nwho in disgust shall venture to crush her! And happy are those who,\r\nhaving dared to receive her in her degraded and frightful shape, shall\r\nat length be rewarded by her in the time of her beauty and her glory!\r\n\r\nThere is only one cure for the evils which newly acquired freedom\r\nproduces; and that cure is freedom. When a prisoner first leaves his\r\ncell he cannot bear the light of day: he is unable to discriminate\r\ncolours, or recognise faces. But the remedy is, not to remand him into\r\nhis dungeon, but to accustom him to the rays of the sun. The blaze of\r\ntruth and liberty may at first dazzle and bewilder nations which have\r\nbecome half blind in the house of bondage. But let them gaze on, and\r\nthey will soon be able to bear it. In a few years men learn to reason.\r\nThe extreme violence of opinions subsides. Hostile theories correct each\r\nother. The scattered elements of truth cease to contend, and begin to\r\ncoalesce. And at length a system of justice and order is educed out of\r\nthe chaos.\r\n\r\nMany politicians of our time are in the habit of laying {246}it down as\r\na self-evident proposition, that no people ought to be free till they\r\nare fit to use their freedom? The maxim is worthy of the fool in the old\r\nstory who resolved not to go into the water till he had learnt to\r\nswim. If men are to wait for liberty till they become wise and good in\r\nslavery, they may indeed wait for ever.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is that we decidedly approve of the conduct of Milton and\r\nthe other wise and good men who, in spite of much that was ridiculous\r\nand hateful in the conduct of their associates, stood firmly by the\r\ncause of Public Liberty. We are not aware that the poet has been charged\r\nwith personal participation in any of the blameable excesses of that\r\ntime. The favourite topic of his enemies is the line of conduct which\r\nhe pursued with regard to the execution of the King. Of that celebrated\r\nproceeding we by no means approve. Still we must say, in justice to\r\nthe many eminent persons who concurred in it, and in justice more\r\nparticularly to the eminent person who defended it, that nothing can be\r\nmore absurd than the imputations which, for the last hundred and sixty\r\nyears, it has been the fashion to cast upon the Regicides. We have,\r\nthroughout, abstained from appealing to first principles. We will\r\nnot appeal to them now. We recur again to the parallel case of the\r\nRevolution. What essential distinction can be drawn between\r\nthe execution of the father and the deposition of the son? What\r\nconstitutional maxim is there which applies to the former and not to\r\nthe latter? The King can do no wrong. If so, James was as innocent as\r\nCharles could have been. The minister only ought to be responsible for\r\nthe acts of the Sovereign. If so, why not impeach Jefferies and retain\r\nJames? The person of a King is sacred. Was the person of {247}James\r\nconsidered sacred at the Boyne? To discharge cannon against an army\r\nin which a King is known to be posted is to approach pretty near to\r\nregicide. Charles, too, it should always be remembered, was put to death\r\nby men who had been exasperated by the hostilities of several years,\r\nand who had never been bound to him by any other tie than that which\r\nwas common to them with all their fellow-citizens. Those who drove James\r\nfrom his throne, who seduced his army, who alienated his friends, who\r\nfirst imprisoned him in his palace, and then turned him out of it, who\r\nbroke in upon his very slumbers by imperious messages, who pursued him\r\nwith fire and sword from one part of the empire to another, who hanged,\r\ndrew, and quartered his adherents, and attainted his innocent heir, were\r\nhis nephew and his two daughters. When we reflect on all these things,\r\nwe are at a loss to conceive how the same persons who, on the fifth of\r\nNovember, thank God for wonderfully conducting his servant William, and\r\nfor making all opposition fall before him until he became our King and\r\nGovernor, can, on the thirtieth of January, contrive to be afraid that\r\nthe blood of the Royal Martyr may be visited on themselves and their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nWe disapprove, we repeat, of the execution of Charles; not because the\r\nconstitution exempts the King from responsibility, for we know that all\r\nsuch maxims, however excellent, have their exceptions; nor because\r\nwe feel any peculiar interest in his character, for we think that his\r\nsentence describes him with perfect justice as “a tyrant, a traitor,\r\na murderer, and a public enemy;” but because we are convinced that the\r\nmeasure was most injurious to the cause of freedom, He whom it removed\r\nwas a captive and a hostage: his {248}heir, to whom the allegiance\r\nof every Royalist was instantly transferred, was at large. The\r\nPresbyterians could never have been perfectly reconciled to the father:\r\nthey had no such rooted enmity to the son. The great body of the\r\npeople, also, contemplated that proceeding with feelings which, however\r\nunreasonable, no government could safely venture to outrage.\r\n\r\nBut though we think the conduct of the Regicides blameable, that of\r\nMilton appears to us in a very different light. The deed was done. It\r\ncould not be undone. The evil was incurred; and the object was to render\r\nit as small as possible. We censure the chiefs of the army for not\r\nyielding to the popular opinion; but we cannot censure Milton for\r\nwishing to change that opinion. The very feeling which would have\r\nrestrained us from committing the act would have led us, after it\r\nhad been committed, to defend it against the ravings of servility and\r\nsuperstition. For the sake of public liberty, we wish that the thing had\r\nnot been done, while the people disapproved of it. But, for the sake of\r\npublic liberty, we should also have wished the people to approve of it\r\nwhen it was done. If any thing more were wanting to the justification\r\nof Milton, the book of Salmasius would furnish it. That miserable\r\nperformance is now with justice considered only as a beacon to\r\nword-catchers, who wish to become statesmen. The celebrity of the man\r\nwho refuted it, the “Æneæ magni dextra,” gives it all its fame with the\r\npresent generation. In that age the state of things was different. It\r\nwas not then fully understood how vast an interval separates the mere\r\nclassical scholar from the political philosopher. Nor can it be doubted\r\nthat a treatise which, bearing the name of so eminent a critic, attacked\r\nthe fundamental principles of all free {249}governments, must, if\r\nsuffered to remain unanswered, have produced a most pernicious effect on\r\nthe public mind.\r\n\r\nWe wish to add a few words relative to another subject, on which\r\nthe enemies of Milton delight to dwell, his conduct during the\r\nadministration of the Protector. That an enthusiastic votary of liberty\r\nshould accept office under a military usurper seems, no doubt, at first\r\nsight, extraordinary. But all the circumstances in which the country was\r\nthen placed were extraordinary. The ambition of Oliver was of no vulgar\r\nkind. He never seems to have coveted despotic power. He at first fought\r\nsincerely and manfully for the Parliament, and never deserted it, till\r\nit had deserted its duty. If he dissolved it by force, it was not\r\ntill he found that the few members who remained after so many deaths,\r\nsecessions, and expulsions, were desirous to appropriate to themselves\r\na power which they held only in trust, and to inflict upon England the\r\ncurse of a Venetian oligarchy. But even when thus placed by violence\r\nat the head of affairs, he did not assume unlimited power. He gave the\r\ncountry a constitution far more perfect than any which had at that time\r\nbeen known in the world. He reformed the representative system in a\r\nmanner which has extorted praise even from Lord Clarendon. For himself\r\nhe demanded indeed the first place in the commonwealth; but with powers\r\nscarcely so great as those of a Dutch stadtholder, or an American\r\npresident. He gave the Parliament a voice in the appointment of\r\nministers, and left to it the whole legislative authority, not even\r\nreserving; to himself a veto on its enactments; and he did not require\r\nthat the chief magistracy should be hereditary in his family. Thus far,\r\nwe think, if the circumstances of the time {250}and the opportunities\r\nwhich he had of aggrandizing himself he fairly considered, he will not\r\nlose by comparison with Washington or Bolivar. Had his moderation been\r\nmet by corresponding moderation, there is no reason to think that he\r\nwould have overstepped the line which he had traced for himself. But\r\nwhen he found that his parliaments questioned the authority under which\r\nthey met, and that he was in danger of being deprived of the restricted\r\npower which was absolutely necessary to his personal safety, then, it\r\nmust be acknowledged, he adopted a more arbitrary policy.\r\n\r\nYet, though we believe that the intentions of Cromwell were at first\r\nhonest, though we believe that he was driven from the noble course\r\nwhich he had marked out for himself by the almost irresistible force of\r\ncircumstances, though we admire, in common with all men of all parties,\r\nthe ability and energy of his splendid administration, we are not\r\npleading for arbitrary and lawless power, even in his hands. We know\r\nthat a good constitution is infinitely better than the best despot.\r\nBut we suspect, that at the time of which we speak, the violence of\r\nreligious and political enmities rendered a stable and happy settlement\r\nnext to impossible. The choice lay, not between Cromwell and liberty,\r\nbut between Cromwell and the Stuarts. That Milton chose well, no man can\r\ndoubt who fairly compares the events of the protectorate with those of\r\nthe thirty years which succeeded it, the darkest and most disgraceful\r\nin the English annals. Cromwell was evidently laying, though in an\r\nirregular manner, the foundations of an admirable system. Never before\r\nhad religious liberty and the freedom of discussion been enjoyed in a\r\ngreater degree. Never had the national honour been better upheld abroad,\r\nor the seat of justice {251}better filled at home. And it was rarely\r\nthat any opposition which stopped short of open rebellion provoked the\r\nresentment of the liberal and magnanimous usurper. The institutions\r\nwhich he had established, as set down in the Instrument of Government,\r\nand the Humble Petition and Advice, were excellent. His practice, it is\r\ntrue, too often departed from the theory of these institutions. But, had\r\nhe lived a few years longer, it is probable that his institutions would\r\nhave survived him, and that his arbitrary practice would have died with\r\nhim. His power had not been consecrated by ancient prejudices. It was\r\nupheld only by his great personal qualities. Little, therefore, was to\r\nbe dreaded from a second protector, unless he were also a second Oliver\r\nCromwell. The events which followed his decease are the most complete\r\nvindication of those who exerted themselves to uphold his authority. His\r\ndeath dissolved the whole frame of society. The army rose against the\r\nparliament, the different corps of the army against each other. Sect\r\nraved against sect. Party plotted against party. The Presbyterians, in\r\ntheir eagerness to be revenged on the Independents, sacrificed their\r\nown liberty, and deserted all their old principles. Without casting one\r\nglance on the past, or requiring one stipulation for the future, they\r\nthrew down their freedom at the feet of the most frivolous and heartless\r\nof tyrants.\r\n\r\nThen came those days, never to be recalled without a blush, the days\r\nof servitude without loyalty and sensuality without love, of dwarfish\r\ntalents and gigantic vices, the paradise of cold hearts and narrow\r\nminds, the golden age of the coward, the bigot, and the slave. The King\r\ncringed to his rival that he might trample on his people, sank into\r\na viceroy of France, and pocketed, {252}with complacent infamy, her\r\ndegrading insults, and her more degrading gold. The caresses of harlots,\r\nand the jests of buffoons, regulated the policy of the state. The\r\ngovernment had just ability enough to deceive, and just religion enough\r\nto persecute. The principles of liberty were the scoff of every grinning\r\ncourtier, and the Anathema Maranatha of every fawning dean. In every\r\nhigh place, worship was paid to Charles and James, Belial and Moloch;\r\nand England propitiated those obscene and cruel idols with the blood of\r\nher best and bravest children. Crime succeeded to crime, and disgrace to\r\ndisgrace, till the race accursed of God and man was a second time driven\r\nforth, to wander on the face of the earth, and to be a by-word and a\r\nshaking of the head to the nations.\r\n\r\nMost of the remarks which we have hitherto made on the public character\r\nof Milton, apply to him only as one of a large body. We shall proceed\r\nto notice some of the peculiarities which distinguished him from his\r\ncontemporaries. And, for that purpose, it is necessary to take a short\r\nsurvey of the parties into which the political world was at that time\r\ndivided. We must premise, that our observations are intended to apply\r\nonly to those who adhered, from a sincere preference, to one or to the\r\nother side. In days of public commotion, every fiction, like an Oriental\r\narmy, is attended by a crowd of camp-followers, an useless and heartless\r\nrabble, who prowl round its line of march in the hope of picking up\r\nsomething under its protection, but desert it in the day of battle, and\r\noften join to exterminate it after a defeat. England, at the time of\r\nwhich we are treating, abounded with fickle and selfish politicians, who\r\ntransferred their support to every government as it rose, who kissed the\r\nhand of the King in 1640, and {253}spat in his face in 1649, who shouted\r\nwith equal glee when Cromwell was inaugurated in Westminster Hall, and\r\nwhen he was dug up to be hanged at Tyburn, who dined on calves’\r\nheads, or stuck up oak-branches, as circumstances altered, without the\r\nslightest shame or repugnance. These we leave out of the account. We\r\ntake our estimate of parties from those who really deserve to be called\r\npartisans.\r\n\r\nWe would speak first of the Puritans, the most remarkable body of men,\r\nperhaps, which the world has ever produced. The odious and ridiculous\r\nparts of their character lie on the surface. He that runs may read them;\r\nnor have there been wanting attentive and malicious observers to point\r\nthem out. For many years after the Restoration, they were the theme\r\nof unmeasured invective and derision. They were exposed to the utmost\r\nlicentiousness of the press and of the stage, at the time when the press\r\nand the stage were most licentious. They were not men of letters; they\r\nwere, as a body, unpopular; they could not defend themselves; and the\r\npublic would not take them under its protection. They were therefore\r\nabandoned, without reserve, to the tender mercies of the satirists\r\nand dramatists. The ostentatious simplicity of their dress, their sour\r\naspect, their nasal twang, their stiff posture, their long graces, their\r\nHebrew names, the Scriptural phrases which they introduced on every\r\noccasion, their contempt of human learning, their detestation of polite\r\namusements, were indeed fair game for the laughers. But it is not from\r\nthe laughers alone that the philosophy of history is to be learnt.\r\nAnd he who approaches this subject should carefully guard against the\r\ninfluence of that potent ridicule which has already misled so many\r\nexcellent writers.\r\n\r\n                   “Ecco {254}il fonte del riso, ed ecco il rio\r\n\r\n                   Che mortali perigli in se contiene:\r\n\r\n                   Hor qui teuer a fren nostro desio,\r\n\r\n                   Ed esser cauti niolto a noi conviene.\"\r\n\r\nThose who roused the people to resistance, who directed their measures\r\nthrough a long series of eventful years, who formed, out of the most\r\nunpromising materials, the finest army that Europe had ever seen, who\r\ntrampled down King, Church, and Aristocracy, who, in the short intervals\r\nof domestic sedition and rebellion, made the name of England terrible to\r\nevery nation on the face of the earth, were no vulgar fanatics. Most\r\nof their absurdities were mere external badges, like the signs of\r\nfreemasonry, or the dresses of friars. We regret that these badges were\r\nnot more attractive. We regret that a body to whose courage and talents\r\nmankind has owed inestimable obligations had not the lofty elegance\r\nwhich distinguished some of the adherents of Charles the First, or\r\nthe easy good-breeding for which the court of Charles the Second was\r\ncelebrated. But, if we must make our choice, we shall, like Bassanio in\r\nthe play, turn from the specious caskets which contain only the Death’s\r\nhead and the Fool’s head, and fix on the plain leaden chest which\r\nconceals the treasure.\r\n\r\nThe Puritans were men whose minds had derived a peculiar character from\r\nthe daily contemplation of superior beings and eternal interests. Not\r\ncontent with acknowledging, in general terms, an overruling Providence,\r\nthey habitually ascribed every event to the will of the Great Being, for\r\nwhose power nothing was too vast, for whose inspection nothing was too\r\nminute. To know him, to serve him, to enjoy him, was with them the great\r\nend of existence. They rejected with contempt the ceremonious homage\r\nwhich other sects substituted {255}for the pure worship of the soul.\r\nInstead of catching occasional glimpses of the Deity through an\r\nobscuring veil, they aspired to gaze full on his intolerable brightness,\r\nand to commune with him face to face. Hence originated their contempt\r\nfor terrestrial distinctions. The difference between the greatest\r\nand the meanest of mankind seemed to vanish, when compared with the\r\nboundless interval which separated the whole race from him on whom their\r\nown eyes were constantly fixed. They recognised no title to superiority\r\nbut his favour; and, confident of that favour, they despised all\r\nthe accomplishments and all the dignities of the world. If they were\r\nunacquainted with the works of philosophers and poets, they were\r\ndeeply read in the oracles of God. If their names were not found in the\r\nregisters of heralds, they were recorded in the Book of Life. If their\r\nsteps were not accompanied by a splendid train of menials, legions of\r\nministering angels had charge over them. Their palaces were houses not\r\nmade with hands; their diadems crowns of glory which should never fade\r\naway. On the rich and the eloquent, on nobles and priests they looked\r\ndown with contempt: for they esteemed themselves rich in a more precious\r\ntreasure, and eloquent in a more sublime language, nobles by the right\r\nof an earlier creation, and priests by the imposition of a mightier\r\nhand. The very meanest of them was a being to whose fate a mysterious\r\nand terrible importance belonged, on whose slightest action the spirits\r\nof light and darkness looked with anxious interest, who had been\r\ndestined, before heaven and earth were created, to enjoy a felicity\r\nwhich should continue when heaven and earth should have passed away.\r\nEvents which short-sighted politicians ascribed to earthly causes, had\r\nbeen ordained on his {256}account. For his sake empires had risen, and\r\nflourished, and decayed. For his sake the Almighty had proclaimed his\r\nwill by the pen of the Evangelist, and the harp of the prophet. He had\r\nbeen wrested by no common deliverer from the grasp of no common foe. He\r\nhad been ransomed by the sweat of no vulgar agony, by the blood of no\r\nearthly sacrifice. It was for him that the sun had been darkened, that\r\nthe rocks had been rent, that the dead had risen, that all nature had\r\nshuddered at the sufferings of her expiring God.\r\n\r\nThus the Puritan was made up of two different men, the one all\r\nself-abasement, penitence, gratitude, passion, the other proud, calm,\r\ninflexible, sagacious. He prostrated himself in the dust before his\r\nMaker: but he set his foot on the neck of his king. In his devotional\r\nretirement, he prayed with convulsions, and groans, and tears. He was\r\nhalf-maddened by glorious or terrible illusions. He heard the lyres\r\nof angels or the tempting whispers of fiends. He caught a gleam of the\r\nBeatific Vision, or woke screaming from dreams of everlasting fire. Like\r\nVane, he thought himself intrusted with the sceptre of the millennial\r\nyear. Like Fleetwood, he cried in the bitterness of his soul that God\r\nhad hid his face from him. But when he took his seat in the council, or\r\ngirt on his sword for war, these impestuous workings of the soul had\r\nleft no perceptible trace behind them. People who saw nothing of the\r\ngodly but their uncouth visages, and heard nothing from them but their\r\ngroans and their whining hymns, yet laugh at them. But those had little\r\nreason to laugh who encountered them in the hall of debate or in the\r\nfield of battle. These fanatics brought to civil and military affairs a\r\ncoolness of judgment and an immutability of purpose which some writers\r\nhave thought {257}inconsistent with their religious zeal, but which were\r\nin fact the necessary effects of it. The intensity of their feelings\r\non one subject made them tranquil on every other. One overpowering\r\nsentiment had subjected to itself pity and hatred, ambition and fear.\r\nDeath had lost its terrors and pleasure its charms. They had their\r\nsmiles and their tears, their raptures and their sorrows, but not for\r\nthe things of this world. Enthusiasm had made them Stoics, had cleared\r\ntheir minds from every vulgar passion and prejudice, and raised them\r\nabove the influence of danger and of corruption. It sometimes might lead\r\nthem to pursue unwise ends, but never to choose unwise means. They went\r\nthrough the world, like Sir Artegal’s iron man Talus with his flail,\r\ncrushing and trampling down oppressors, mingling with human beings, but\r\nhaving neither part nor lot in human infirmities, insensible to fatigue,\r\nto pleasure, and to pain, not to be pierced by any weapon, not to be\r\nwithstood by any barrier.\r\n\r\nSuch we believe to have been the character of the Puritans. We perceive\r\nthe absurdity of their manners. We dislike the sullen gloom of their\r\ndomestic habits. We acknowledge that the tone of their minds was often\r\ninjured by straining after things too high for mortal reach: and we know\r\nthat, in spite of their hatred of Popery, they too often fell into the\r\nworst vices of that bad system, intolerance and extravagant austerity,\r\nthat they had their anchorites and their crusades, their Dunstans and\r\ntheir De Monforts, their Dominies and their Escobars. Yet, when all\r\ncircumstances are taken into consideration, we do not hesitate to\r\npronounce them a brave, a wise, an honest, and an useful body.\r\n\r\nThe Puritans espoused the cause of civil liberty {258}mainly because\r\nit was the cause of religion. There was another party, by no means\r\nnumerous, but distinguished by learning and ability, which acted with\r\nthem on very different principles. We speak of those whom Cromwell was\r\naccustomed to call the Heathens, men who were, in the phraseology\r\nof that time, doubting; Thomases or careless Gallios with regard to\r\nreligious subjects, but passionate worshippers of freedom. Heated by the\r\nstudy of ancient literature, they set up their country as their idol,\r\nand proposed to themselves the heroes of Plutarch as their examples.\r\nThey seem to have borne some resemblance to the Brissotines of\r\nthe French Revolution. But it is not very easy to draw the line of\r\ndistinction between them and their devout associates, whose tone and\r\nmanner they sometimes found it convenient to affect, and sometimes, it\r\nis probable, imperceptibly adopted.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the Royalists. We shall attempt to speak of them, as we\r\nhave spoken of their antagonists, with perfect candour. We shall not\r\ncharge upon a whole party the profligacy and baseness of the horseboys,\r\ngamblers and bravoes, whom the hope of license and plunder attracted\r\nfrom all the dens of Whitefriars to the standard of Charles, and\r\nwho disgraced their associates by excesses which, under the stricter\r\ndiscipline of the Parliamentary armies, were never tolerated. We will\r\nselect a more favourable specimen. Thinking as we do that the cause of\r\nthe King was the cause of bigotry and tyranny, we yet cannot refrain\r\nfrom looking with complacency on the character of the honest old\r\nCavaliers. We feel a national pride in comparing them with the\r\ninstruments which the despots of other countries are compelled\r\nto employ, with the mutes who throng their antechambers, and the\r\nJanissaries who {259}mount guard at their gates. Our royalist countrymen\r\nwere not heartless, dangling courtiers, bowing at every step, and\r\nsimpering at every word. They were not mere machines for destruction,\r\ndressed up in uniforms, caned into skill, intoxicated into valour,\r\ndefending without love, destroying without hatred. There was a freedom\r\nin them subserviency, a nobleness in their very degradation. The\r\nsentiment of individual independence was strong within them. They were\r\nindeed misled, but by no base or selfish motive. Compassion and romantic\r\nhonour, the prejudices of childhood, and the venerable names of\r\nhistory, threw over them a spell potent as that of Duessa; and, like\r\nthe Red-Cross Knight, they thought that they were doing battle for an\r\ninjured beauty, while they defended a false and loathsome sorceress.\r\nIn truth they scarcely entered at all into the merits of the political\r\nquestion. It was not for a treacherous king or an intolerant church that\r\nthey fought, but for the old banner which had waved in so many battles\r\nover the heads of their fathers, and for the altars at which they\r\nhad received the hands of their brides. Though nothing could be more\r\nerroneous than their political opinions, they possessed, in a far\r\ngreater degree than their adversaries, those qualities which are the\r\ngrace of private life. With many of the vices of the Round Table,\r\nthey had also many of its virtues, courtesy, generosity, veracity,\r\ntenderness, and respect for women. They had far more both of profound\r\nand of polite learning than the Puritans. Their manners were more\r\nengaging, their tempers more amiable, their tastes more elegant, and\r\ntheir households more cheerful.\r\n\r\nMilton did not strictly belong to any of the classes which we have\r\ndescribed. He was not a Puritan. He {260}was not a freethinker. He was\r\nnot a Royalist. In his character the noblest qualities of every party\r\nwere combinée! in harmonious union. From the Parliament and from the\r\nCourt, from the conventicle and from the Gothic cloister, from the\r\ngloomy and sepulchral circles of the Roundheads, and from the Christmas\r\nrevel of the hospitable Cavalier, his nature selected and drew to\r\nitself whatever was great and good, while it rejected all the base and\r\npernicious ingredients by which those finer elements were defiled. Like\r\nthe Puritans, he lived\r\n\r\n                   “As ever in his great task-master’s eye.\"\r\n\r\nLike them, he kept his mind continually fixed on an Almighty Judge and\r\nan eternal reward. And hence he acquired their contempt of external\r\ncircumstances, their fortitude, their tranquillity, their inflexible\r\nresolution. But not the coolest sceptic or the most profane scoffer was\r\nmore perfectly free from the contagion of their frantic delusions, their\r\nsavage manners, their ludicrous jargon, their scorn of science, and\r\ntheir aversion to pleasure. Hating tyranny with a perfect hatred, he\r\nhad nevertheless all the estimable and ornamental qualities which were\r\nalmost entirely monopolised by the party of the tyrant. There was none\r\nwho had a stronger sense of the value of literature, a finer relish for\r\nevery elegant amusement, or a more chivalrous delicacy of honour\r\nand love. Though his opinions were democratic, his tastes and his\r\nassociations were such as harmonise best with monarchy and aristocracy.\r\nHe was under the influence of all the feelings by which the gallant\r\nCavaliers were misled. But of those feelings he was the master and\r\nnot the slave. Like the hero of Homer, he enjoyed all the pleasures of\r\nfascination; but he was not fascinated. {261}He listened to the song of\r\nthe Syrens; yet he glided by without being seduced to their fatal\r\nshore. He tasted the cup of Circe; but he bore about him a sure antidote\r\nagainst the effects of its bewitching sweetness. The allusions which\r\ncaptivated his imagination never impaired his reasoning powers. The\r\nstatesman was proof against the splendour, the solemnity, and the\r\nromance which enchanted the poet. Any person who will contrast the\r\nsentiments expressed in his treatises on Prelacy with the exquisite\r\nlines on ecclesiastical architecture and music in the Penseroso, which\r\nwas published about the same time, will understand our meaning. This is\r\nan inconsistency which, more than any thing else, raises his character\r\nin our estimation, because it shows how many private tastes and feelings\r\nhe sacrificed, in order to do what he considered his duty to mankind.\r\nIt is the very struggle of the noble Othello. His heart relents; but his\r\nhand is firm. He does nought in hate, but all in honour. He kisses the\r\nbeautiful deceiver before he destroys her.\r\n\r\nThat from which the public character of Milton derives its great and\r\npeculiar splendour, still remains to be mentioned. If he exerted himself\r\nto overthrow a forsworn king and a persecuting hierarchy, he exerted\r\nhimself in conjunction with others. But the glory of the battle which he\r\nfought for the species of freedom which is the most valuable, and which\r\nwas then the least understood, the freedom of the human mind, is all\r\nhis own. Thousands and tens of thousands among his contemporaries raised\r\ntheir voices against Ship-money and the Star-chamber. But there were few\r\nindeed who discerned the more fearful evils of moral and intellectual\r\nslavery, and the benefits which would result from the liberty of the\r\npress and the unfettered {262}exercise of private judgment. These were\r\nthe objects which Milton justly conceived to be the most important. He\r\nwas desirous that the people should think for themselves as well as tax\r\nthemselves, and should be emancipated from the dominion of prejudice\r\nas well as from that of Charles. He knew that those who, with the best\r\nintentions, overlooked these schemes of reform, and contented themselves\r\nwith pulling down the King and imprisoning the malignants, acted like\r\nthe heedless brothers in his own poem, who, in their eagerness to\r\ndisperse the train of the sorcerer, neglected the means of liberating\r\nthe captive. They thought only of conquering when they should have\r\nthought of disenchanting.\r\n\r\n               “Oh, ye mistook! Ye should have snatched his wand\r\n\r\n               And bound him fast. Without the rod reversed,\r\n\r\n               And backward mutters of dissevering power,\r\n\r\n               We cannot free the lady that sits here\r\n\r\n               Bound in strong fetters fixed and motionless.\"\r\n\r\nTo reverse the rod, to spell the charm backward, to break the ties which\r\nbound a stupefied people to the seat of enchantment, was the noble aim\r\nof Milton. To this all his public conduct was directed. For this he\r\njoined the Presbyterians; for this he forsook them. He fought their\r\nperilous battle; but he turned away with disdain from their insolent\r\ntriumph. He saw that they, like those whom they had vanquished, were\r\nhostile to the liberty of thought. He therefore joined the Independents,\r\nand called upon Cromwell to break the secular chain, and to save free\r\nconscience from the paw of the Presbyterian wolf. With a view to the\r\nsame great object, he attacked the licensing system, in that sublime\r\ntreatise which every statesman should wear as a sign upon his hand and\r\nas frontlets between his eyes. His attacks were, in general, directed\r\nless {263}against particular abuses than against those deeply-seated\r\nerrors on which almost all abuses are founded, the servile worship of\r\neminent men and the irrational dread of innovation.\r\n\r\nThat he might shake the foundations of these debasing sentiments\r\nmore effectually, he always selected for himself the boldest literary\r\nservices. He never came up in the rear, when the outworks had been\r\ncarried and the breach entered. He pressed into the forlorn hope. At\r\nthe beginning of the changes, he wrote with incomparable energy and\r\neloquence against the bishops. But, when his opinion seemed likely to\r\nprevail, he passed on to other subjects, and abandoned prelacy to the\r\ncrowd of writers who now hastened to insult a falling party. There is no\r\nmore hazardous enterprise than that of bearing the torch of truth into\r\nthose dark and infected recesses in which no light has ever shone. But\r\nit was the choice and the pleasure of Milton to penetrate the noisome\r\nvapours, and to brave the terrible explosion. Those who most disapprove\r\nof his opinions must respect the hardihood with which he maintained\r\nthem. He, in general, left to others the credit of expounding and\r\ndefending the popular parts of his religious and political creed. He\r\ntook his own stand upon those which the great body of his countrymen\r\nreprobated as criminal, or derided as paradoxical. He stood up for\r\ndivorce and regicide. He attacked the prevailing systems of education.\r\nHis radiant and beneficent career resembled that of the god of light and\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\n               ” Nitor in adversum; nec me, qui caetera, vincit\r\n\r\n               Impetus, et rapido contrarius evehor orbi.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the prose writings of Milton should, in\r\nour time, be so little read. As compositions, {264}they deserve the\r\nattention of every man who wishes to become acquainted with the full\r\npower of the English language. They abound with passages compared with\r\nwhich the finest declamations of Burke sink into insignificance. They\r\nare a perfect field of cloth of gold. The style is stiff with gorgeous\r\nembroidery. Not even in the earlier hooks of the Paradise Lost has the\r\ngreat poet ever risen higher than in those parts of his controversial\r\nworks in which his feelings, excited by conflict, find a vent in bursts\r\nof devotional and lyric rapture. It is, to borrow his own majestic\r\nlanguage, “a sevenfold chorus of hallelujahs and harping symphonies.”\r\n\r\nWe had intended to look more closely at these performances, to analyse\r\nthe peculiarities of the diction, to dwell at some length on the sublime\r\nwisdom of the Areopagitica and the nervous rhetoric of the Iconoclast,\r\nand to point out some of those magnificent passages which occur in the\r\nTreatise of Reformation, and the Animadversions on the Remonstrant.\r\nBut the length to which our remarks have already extended renders this\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nWe must conclude. And yet we can scarcely tear ourselves away from the\r\nsubject. The days immediately following the publication of this relic of\r\nMilton appear to be peculiarly set apart, and consecrated to his memory.\r\nAnd we shall scarcely be censured if, on this his festival, we be found\r\nlingering near his shrine, how worthless soever may be the offering\r\nwhich we bring to it. While this book lies on our table, we seem to be\r\ncontemporaries of the writer. We are transported a hundred and fifty\r\nyears back. We can almost fancy that we are visiting him in his small\r\nlodging; that we see him sitting at the old organ beneath {265}the\r\nfaded green hangings; that we can catch the quick twinkle of his eyes,\r\nrolling in vain to find the day; that we are reading in the lines of his\r\nnoble countenance the proud and mournful history of his glory and his\r\naffliction. We image to ourselves the breathless silence in which we\r\nshould listen to his slightest word, the passionate veneration with\r\nwhich we should kneel to kiss his hand and weep upon it, the earnestness\r\nwith which we should endeavour to console him, if indeed such a spirit\r\ncould need consolation, for the neglect of an age unworthy of his\r\ntalents and his virtues, the eagerness with which we should contest\r\nwith his daughters, or with his Quaker friend Elwood, the privilege\r\nof reading Homer to him, or of taking down the immortal accents which\r\nflowed from his lips.\r\n\r\nThese are perhaps foolish feelings. Yet we cannot be ashamed of them;\r\nnor shall we be sorry if what we have written shall in any degree excite\r\nthem in other minds. We are not much in the habit of idolizing either\r\nthe living or the dead. And we think that there is no more certain\r\nindication of a weak and ill-regulated intellect than that propensity\r\nwhich, for want of a better name, we will venture to christen\r\nBoswellism. But there are a few characters which have stood the closest\r\nscrutiny and the severest tests, which have been tried in the furnace\r\nand have proved pure, which have been weighed in the balance and have\r\nnot been found wanting, which have been declared sterling by the general\r\nconsent of mankind, and which are visibly stamped with the image and\r\nsuperscription of the Most High. These great men we trust that we know\r\nhow to prize; and of these was Milton. The sight of his books, the\r\nsound of his name, are pleasant to us. His thoughts resemble {266}those\r\ncelestial fruits and flowers which the Virgin Martyr of Massinger\r\nsent down from the gardens of Paradise to the earth, and which were\r\ndistinguished from the productions of other soils, not only by superior\r\nbloom and sweetness, but by miraculous efficacy to invigorate and to\r\nheal. They are powerful, not only to delight, but to elevate and purify.\r\nNor do we envy the man who can study either the life or the writings of\r\nthe great poet and patriot, without aspiring to emulate, not indeed the\r\nsublime works with which his genius has enriched our literature, but\r\nthe zeal with which he laboured for the public good, the fortitude with\r\nwhich he endured every private calamity, the lofty disdain with which he\r\nlooked down on temptations and dangers, the deadly hatred which he bore\r\nto bigots and tyrants, and the faith which he so sternly kept with his\r\ncountry and with his fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACHIAVELLI. (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n{267}(_Edinburgh Review_, March 1827.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who have attended to this practice of our literary tribunal are\r\nwell aware that, by means of certain legal fictions similar to those of\r\nWestminster Hall, we are frequently enabled to take cognisance of cases\r\nlying beyond the sphere of our original jurisdiction. We need hardly\r\nsay, therefore, that in the present instance M. Périer is merely a\r\nRichard Roe, who will not be mentioned in any subsequent stage of the\r\nproceedings, and whose name is used for the sole purpose of bringing\r\nMachiavelli into court.\r\n\r\nWe doubt whether any name in literary history be so generally odious as\r\nthat of the man whose character and writings we now propose to consider.\r\nThe terms in which he is commonly described would seem to import that\r\nhe was the Tempter, the Evil Principle, the discoverer of ambition\r\nand revenge, the original inventor of perjury, and that, before the\r\npublication of his fatal Prince, there had never been a hypocrite, a\r\ntyrant, or a traitor, a simulated virtue, or a convenient crime.\r\nOne writer gravely assures us that Maurice of Saxony learned all his\r\nfraudulent policy from that execrable volume. Another remarks that since\r\nit was\r\n\r\n     (1) Ouvres completes de Machiavel, traduites par J. V.\r\n     Perier. Paris: 1825.\r\n\r\n{268}translated into Turkish, the Sultans have been more addicted than\r\nformerly to the custom of strangling their brothers. Lord Lyttelton\r\ncharges the poor Florentine with the manifold treasons of the house of\r\nGuise, and with the massacre of St. Bartholomew. Several authors have\r\nhinted that the Gunpowder Plot is to be primarily attributed to his\r\ndoctrines, and seem to think that his effigy ought to be substituted for\r\nthat of Guy Faux, in those processions by which the ingenious youth of\r\nEngland annually commemorate the preservation of the Three Estates. The\r\nChurch of Rome has pronounced his works accursed things. Nor have our\r\nown countrymen been backward in testifying their opinion of his merits.\r\nOut of his surname they have coined an epithet for a knave, and out of\r\nhis Christian name a synonyme for the Devil. (1)\r\n\r\nIt is indeed scarcely possible for any person, not well acquainted\r\nwith the history and literature of Italy, to read without horror and\r\namazement the celebrated treatise winch has brought so much obloquy on\r\nthe name of Machiavelli. Such a display of wickedness, naked yet not\r\nashamed, such cool, judicious, scientific atrocity, seemed rather to\r\nbelong to a fiend than to the most depraved of men. Principles which\r\nthe most hardened ruffian would scarcely hint to his most trusted\r\naccomplice, or avow, without the disguise of some palliating\r\nsophism, even to his own mind, are professed without the slightest\r\ncircumlocution, and assumed as the fundamental axioms of all political\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that ordinary readers should regard\r\n\r\n                   (1) Nick Machiavel had ne’er a trick,\r\n\r\n                   Tho’ he gave his name to our old Nick.\r\n\r\n                        Hudibras, Part III. Canto I.\r\n\r\nBut, we believe, there is a schism on this subject among the\r\nantiquarians. {269}the author of such a book as the most depraved and\r\nshameless of human beings. Wise men, however, have always been inclined\r\nto look with great suspicion on the angels and dæmons of the multitude:\r\nand in the present instance, several circumstances have led even\r\nsuperficial observers to question the justice of the vulgar decision. It\r\nis notorious that Machiavelli was, through life, a zealous republican.\r\nIn the same year in which he composed his manual of King-craft, he\r\nsuffered imprisonment and torture in the cause of public liberty. It\r\nseems inconceivable that the martyr of freedom should have designedly\r\nacted as the apostle of tyranny. Several eminent writers have,\r\ntherefore, endeavoured to detect in this unfortunate performance some\r\nconcealed meaning, more consistent with the character and conduct of the\r\nauthor than that which appears at the first glance.\r\n\r\nOne hypothesis is that Machiavelli intended to practise on the young\r\nLorenzo de Medici a fraud similar to that which Sunderland is said to\r\nhave employed against our James the Second, and that he urged his pupil\r\nto violent and perfidious measures, as the surest means of accelerating\r\nthe moment of deliverance and revenge. Another supposition which Lord\r\nBacon seems to countenance, is that the treatise was merely a piece of\r\ngrave irony, intended to warn nations against the arts of ambitious men.\r\nIt would be easy to show that neither of these solutions is consistent\r\nwith many passages in The Prince itself. But the most decisive\r\nrefutation is that which is furnished by the other works of Machiavelli.\r\nIn all the writings which he gave to the public, and in all those\r\nwhich the research of editors has, in the course of three centuries,\r\ndiscovered, in his Comedies, designed for the entertainment of the\r\n{270}multitude, in his Comments on Livy, intended for the perusal of the\r\nmost enthusiastic patriots of Florence, in his History, inscribed to\r\none of the most amiable and estimable of the Popes, in his public\r\ndispatches, in his private memoranda, the same obliquity of moral\r\nprinciple for which The Prince is so severely censured is more or less\r\ndiscernible. We doubt whether it would be possible to find, in all the\r\nmany volumes of his compositions, a single expression indicating that\r\ndissimulation and treachery had ever struck him as discreditable.\r\n\r\nAfter this, it may seem ridiculous to say that we are acquainted with\r\nfew writings which exhibit so much elevation of sentiment, so pure and\r\nwarm a zeal for the public good, or so just a view of the duties and\r\nrights of citizens, as those of Machiavelli. Yet so it is. And even\r\nfrom The Prince itself we could select many passages in support of this\r\nremark. To a reader of our age and country this inconsistency is, at\r\nfirst, perfectly bewildering. The whole man seems to be an enigma,\r\na grotesque assemblage of incongruous qualities, selfishness and\r\ngenerosity, cruelty and benevolence, craft and simplicity, abject\r\nvillany and romantic heroism. One sentence is such as a veteran\r\ndiplomatist would scarcely write in cipher for the direction of his most\r\nconfidential spy; the next seems to be extracted from a theme composed\r\nby an ardent schoolboy on the death of Leonidas. An act of dexterous\r\nperfidy, and an act of patriotic self-devotion, call forth the same kind\r\nand the same degree of respectful admiration. The moral sensibility of\r\nthe writer seems at once to be morbidly obtuse and morbidly acute. Two\r\ncharacters altogether dissimilar are united in him. They are not merely\r\njoined, but interwoven. They {271}are the warp and the woof of his mind;\r\nand their combination, like that of the variegated threads in shot silk,\r\ngives to the whole texture a glancing and ever-changing appearance. The\r\nexplanation might have been easy, if he had been a very weak or a very\r\naffected man. But he was evidently neither the one nor the other.\r\nHis works prove, beyond all contradiction, that his understanding was\r\nstrong, his taste pure, and his sense of the ridiculous exquisitely\r\nkeen.\r\n\r\nThis is strange: and yet the strangest is behind. There is no reason\r\nwhatever to think, that those amongst whom he lived saw any thing\r\nshocking or incongruous in his writings. Abundant proofs remain of the\r\nhigh estimation in which both his works and his person were held by\r\nthe most respectable among his contemporaries. Clement the Seventh\r\npatronised the publication of those very books which the Council of\r\nTrent, in the following generation, pronounced unfit for the perusal\r\nof Christians. Some members of the democratical party censured the\r\nSecretary for dedicating The Prince to a patron who bore the unpopular\r\nname of Medici. But to those immoral doctrines which have since called\r\nforth such severe reprehensions no exception appears to have been taken.\r\nThe cry against them was first raised beyond the Alps, and seems to have\r\nbeen heard with amazement in Italy. The earliest assailant, as far as we\r\nare aware, was a countryman of our own, Cardinal Pole. The author of the\r\nAnti-Machiavelli was a French Protestant.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, in the state of moral feeling among the Italians of\r\nthose times that we must seek for the real explanation of what seems\r\nmost mysterious in the life and writings of this remarkable man. As this\r\nis a subject which suggests many interesting considerations, {272}both\r\npolitical and metaphysical, we shall make no apology for discussing it\r\nat some length.\r\n\r\nDuring the gloomy and disastrous centuries which followed the downfall\r\nof the Roman Empire, Italy had preserved, in a far greater degree than\r\nany other part of Western Europe, the traces of ancient civilisation.\r\nThe night which descended upon her was the night of an Arctic summer.\r\nThe dawn began to reappear before the last reflection of the preceding\r\nsunset had faded from the horizon. It was in the time of the French\r\nMerovingians and of the Saxon Heptarchy that ignorance and ferocity\r\nseemed to have done their worst. Yet even then the Neapolitan provinces,\r\nrecognising the authority of the Eastern Empire, preserved something\r\nof Eastern knowledge and refinement. Rome, protected by the sacred\r\ncharacter of her Pontiffs, enjoyed at least comparative security and\r\nrepose. Even in those regions where the sanguinary Lombards had fixed\r\ntheir monarchy, there was incomparably more of wealth, of information,\r\nof physical comfort, and of social order, than could be found in Gaul,\r\nBritain, or Germany.\r\n\r\nThat which most distinguished Italy from the neighbouring countries\r\nwas the importance which the population of the towns, at a very early\r\nperiod, began to acquire. Some cities had been founded in wild and\r\nremote situations, by fugitives who had escaped from the rage of the\r\nbarbarians. Such were Venice and Genoa, which preserved their freedom\r\nby their obscurity, till they became able to preserve it by their power.\r\nOther cities seem to have retained, under all the changing dynasties of\r\ninvaders, under Odoacer and Theodoric, Narses and Alboin, the municipal\r\ninstitutions which had been conferred on them by the liberal policy of\r\nthe {273}Great Republic. In provinces which the central government was\r\ntoo feeble either to protect or to oppress, these institutions gradually\r\nacquired stability and vigour. The citizens, defended by their walls,\r\nand governed by their own magistrates and their own by-laws, enjoyed a\r\nconsiderable share of republican independence. Thus a strong democratic\r\nspirit was called into action. The Carlovingian sovereigns were too\r\nimbecile to subdue it. The generous policy of Otlio encouraged it. It\r\nmight perhaps have been suppressed by a close coalition between\r\nthe Church and the Empire. It was fostered and invigorated by their\r\ndisputes. In the twelfth century it attained its full vigour, and, after\r\na long and doubtful conflict, triumphed over the abilities and courage\r\nof the Swabian Princes.\r\n\r\nThe assistance of the Ecclesiastical power had greatly contributed to\r\nthe success of the Guelfs. That success would, however, have been a\r\ndoubtful good, if its only effect had been to substitute a moral for\r\na political servitude, and to exalt the Popes at the expense of the\r\nCæsars. Happily the public mind of Italy had long contained the seeds of\r\nfree opinions, which were now rapidly developed by the genial influence\r\nof free institutions. The people of that country had observed the\r\nwhole machinery of the church, its saints and its miracles, its lofty\r\npretensions and its splendid ceremonial, its worthless blessings and its\r\nharmless curses, too long and too closely to be duped. They stood behind\r\nthe scenes on which others were gazing with childish awe and interest.\r\nThey witnessed the arrangement of the pullies, and the manufacture of\r\nthe thunders. They saw the natural faces and heard the natural voices of\r\nthe actors. Distant nations looked on the Pope as the vicegerent of\r\nthe Almighty, the oracle of {274}the All-wise, the umpire from whose\r\ndecisions, in the disputes either of theologians or of kings, no\r\nChristian ought to appeal. The Italians were acquainted with all the\r\nfollies of his youth, and with all the dishonest arts by which he had\r\nattained power. They knew how often he had employed the keys of the\r\nChurch to release himself from the most sacred engagements, and its\r\nwealth to pamper his mistresses and nephews. The doctrines and rites of\r\nthe established religion they treated with decent reverence. But though\r\nthey still called themselves Catholics, they had ceased to be Papists.\r\nThose spiritual arms which carried terror into the palaces and camps\r\nof the proudest sovereigns excited only contempt in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the Vatican. Alexander, when he commanded our Henry the\r\nSecond to submit to the lash before the tomb of a rebellious subject,\r\nwas himself an exile. The Romans, apprehending that he entertained\r\ndesigns against their liberties, had driven him from their city; and,\r\nthough he solemnly promised to confine himself for the future to his\r\nspiritual functions, they still refused to readmit him.\r\n\r\nIn every other part of Europe, a large and powerful privileged class\r\ntrampled on the people and defied the government. But, in the\r\nmost flourishing parts of Italy, the feudal nobles were reduced to\r\ncomparative insignificance. In some districts they took shelter under\r\nthe protection of the powerful commonwealths which they were unable to\r\noppose, and gradually sank into the mass of burghers. In other places\r\nthey possessed great influence; but it was an influence widely different\r\nfrom that which was exercised by the aristocracy of any Transalpine\r\nkingdom. They were not petty princes, but eminent citizens. Instead\r\nof strengthening {275}their fastnesses among the mountains, they\r\nembellished their palaces in the market-place. The state of society in\r\nthe Neapolitan dominions, and in some parts of the Ecclesiastical State,\r\nmore nearly resembled that which existed in the great monarchies of\r\nEurope. But the governments of Lombardy and Tuscany, through all their\r\nrevolutions, preserved a different character. A people, when assembled\r\nin a town, is far more formidable to its rulers than when dispersed\r\nover a wide extent of country. The most arbitrary of the Cæsars found it\r\nnecessary to feed and divert the inhabitants of their unwieldly capital\r\nat the expense of the provinces. The citizens of Madrid have more than\r\nonce besieged their sovereign in his own palace, and extorted from him\r\nthe most humiliating concessions. The Sultans have often been compelled\r\nto propitiate the furious rabble of Constantinople with the head of\r\nan unpopular Vizier. From the same cause there was a certain tinge of\r\ndemocracy in the monarchies and aristocracies of Northern Italy.\r\n\r\nThus liberty, partially indeed and transiently, revisited Italy; and\r\nwith liberty came commerce and empire, science and taste, all the\r\ncomforts and all the ornaments of life. The Crusades, from which the\r\ninhabitants of other countries gained nothing but relics and wounds,\r\nbrought to the rising commonwealths of the Adriatic and Tyrrhene seas\r\na large increase of wealth, dominion, and knowledge. The moral and the\r\ngeographical position of those commonwealths enabled them to profit\r\nalike by the barbarism of the West and by the civilisation of the East.\r\nItalian ships covered every sea. Italian factories rose on every\r\nshore. The tables of Italian money-changers were set in every city.\r\nManufactures flourished. Banks were established. {276}The operations\r\nof the commercial machine were facilitated by many useful and beautiful\r\ninventions. We doubt whether any country of Europe, our own excepted,\r\nhave at the present time reached so high a point of wealth and\r\ncivilisation as some parts of Italy had attained four hundred years ago.\r\nHistorians rarely descend to those details from which alone the real\r\nstate of a community can be collected. Hence posterity is too often\r\ndeceived by the vague hyperboles of poets and rhetoricians, who mistake\r\nthe splendour of a court for the happiness of a people. Fortunately,\r\nJohn Villani has given us an ample and precise account of the state of\r\nFlorence in the early part of the fourteenth century. The revenue of\r\nthe Republic amounted to three hundred thousand florins; a sum which,\r\nallowing for the depreciation of the precious metals, was at least\r\nequivalent to six hundred thousand pounds sterling; a larger sum than\r\nEngland and Ireland, two centuries ago, yielded annually to Elizabeth.\r\nThe manufacture of wool alone employed two hundred factories and thirty\r\nthousand workmen. The cloth annually produced sold, at an average, for\r\ntwelve hundred thousand florins; a sum fully equal, in exchangeable\r\nvalue, to two millions and a half of our money. Four hundred thousand\r\nflorins were annually coined. Eighty banks conducted the commercial\r\noperations, not of Florence only, but of all Europe. The transactions\r\nof these establishments were sometimes of a magnitude which may surprise\r\neven the contemporaries of the Barings and the Rothschilds. Two houses\r\nadvanced to Edward the Third of England upwards of three hundred\r\nthousand marks, at a time when the mark contained more silver than fifty\r\nshillings of the present day, and when the value of silver was more\r\n{277}than quadruple of what it now is. The city and its environs\r\ncontained a hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants. In the various\r\nschools about ten thousand children were taught to read: twelve hundred\r\nstudied arithmetic; six hundred received a learned education.\r\n\r\nThe progress of elegant literature and of the fine arts was proportioned\r\nto that of the public prosperity. Under the despotic successors of\r\nAugustus, all the fields of the intellect had been turned into arid\r\nwastes, still marked out by formal boundaries, still retaining the\r\ntraces of old cultivation, but yielding neither flowers nor fruit.\r\nThe deluge of barbarism came. It swept away all the landmarks. It\r\nobliterated all the signs of former tillage. But it fertilised while it\r\ndevastated. When it receded, the wilderness was as the garden of God,\r\nrejoicing on every side, laughing, clapping its hands, pouring forth,\r\nin spontaneous abundance, every thing brilliant, or fragrant, or\r\nnourishing. A new language, characterised by simple sweetness and simple\r\nenergy, had attained perfection. No tongue ever furnished more gorgeous\r\nand vivid tints to poetry; nor was it long before a poet appeared, who\r\nknew how to employ them. Early in the fourteenth century came forth the\r\nDivine Comedy, beyond comparison the greatest work of imagination which\r\nhad appeared since the poems of Homer. The following generation produced\r\nindeed no second Dante: but it was eminently distinguished by general\r\nintellectual activity. The study of the Latin writers had never been\r\nwholly neglected in Italy. But Petrarch introduced a more profound,\r\nliberal, and elegant scholarship, had communicated to his countrymen\r\nthat enthusiasm for the literature, the history, and the antiquities\r\nof Rome, which divided his own heart with a frigid mistress and a more\r\nfrigid {278}Muse. Boccaccio turned their attention to the more sublime\r\nand graceful models of Greece.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, the admiration of learning and genius became almost an\r\nidolatry among the people of Italy. Kings and republics, cardinals\r\nand doges, vied with each other in honouring and flattering Petrarch.\r\nEmbassies from rival states solicited the honour of his instructions.\r\nHis coronation agitated the Court of Naples and the people of Rome as\r\nmuch as the most important political transaction could have done. To\r\ncollect books and antiques, to found professorships, to patronise men of\r\nlearning, became almost universal fashions among the great. The spirit\r\nof literary research allied itself to that of commercial enterprise.\r\nEvery place to which the merchant princes of Florence extended their\r\ngigantic traffic, from the bazars of the Tigris to the monasteries\r\nof the Clyde, was ransacked for medals and manuscripts. Architecture,\r\npainting, and sculpture, were munificently encouraged. Indeed it would\r\nbe difficult to name an Italian of eminence, during the period of which\r\nwe speak, who, whatever may have been his general character, did not at\r\nleast affect a love of letters and of the arts.\r\n\r\nKnowledge and public prosperity continued to advance together. Both\r\nattained their meridian in the age of Lorenzo the Magnificent. We\r\ncannot refrain from quoting the splendid passage, in which the Tuscan\r\nThucydides describes the state of Italy at that period. “Ridotta tutta\r\nin somma pace e tranquillità, coltivata non meno ne’ luoghi più montuosi\r\ne pin sterili che nelle pianure e regîoni più fertili, ne sottoposta ad\r\naltro imperio che de’ suoi medesimi, non solo era abbon-dantissima d’\r\nabitatori c di ricchezze; ma illustrata, sommamente dalla magnificenza\r\ndi molti principi, dallo {279}splendore cli moite nobilissime e\r\nbellissime città, dalla sedia e maestà della religione, fioriva d’\r\nnomini prestantissimi ela amministrazione delle cose publiche, e d’\r\ningegni molto nobili in tutte le scienze, ed in qua-lunque arte preelara\r\ned industriosa.” When we peruse this just and splendid description, we\r\ncan scarcely persuade ourselves that we are reading of times in which\r\nthe annals of England and France present us only with a frightful\r\nspectacle of poverty, barbarity, and ignorance. From the oppressions of\r\nilliterate masters, and the sufferings of a degraded peasantry, it is\r\ndelightful to turn to the opulent and enlightened States of Italy, to\r\nthe vast and magnificent cities, the ports, the arsenals, the villas,\r\nthe museums, the libraries, the marts filled with every article of\r\ncomfort or luxury, the factories swarming with artisans, the Apennines\r\ncovered with rich cultivation up to their very summits, the Po wafting\r\nthe harvests of Lombardy to the granaries of Venice, and carrying back\r\nthe silks of Bengal and the furs of Siberia to the palaces of Milan.\r\nWith peculiar pleasure, every cultivated mind must repose on the fair,\r\nthe happy, the glorious Florence, the halls which rang with the mirth\r\nof Pulci, the cell where twinkled the midnight lamp of Politian, the\r\nstatues on which the young eye of Michael Angelo glared with the frenzy\r\nof a kindred inspiration, the gardens in which Lorenzo meditated some\r\nsparkling song for the May-day dance of the Etrurian virgins. Alas for\r\nthe beautiful city! Alas, for the wit and the learning, the genius and\r\nthe love!\r\n\r\n               “Le donne, e i cavalier, gli affanni, e gli agi,\r\n\r\n               Clie ne’nvogliava amore e cortesia\r\n\r\n               Là dove i cuor son fatti si malvagi.\"\r\n\r\nA time was at hand, when all the seven vials of the {280}Apocalypse were\r\nto be poured forth and shaken out over those pleasant countries, a time\r\nof slaughter, famine, beggary, infamy, slavery, despair.\r\n\r\nIn the Italian States, as in many natural bodies, untimely decrepitude\r\nwas the penalty of precocious maturity. Their early greatness, and their\r\nearly decline, are principally to be attributed to the same cause, the\r\npreponderance which the towns acquired in the political system.\r\n\r\nIn a community of hunters or of shepherds, every man easily and\r\nnecessarily becomes a soldier. His ordinary avocations are perfectly\r\ncompatible with all the duties of military service. However remote may\r\nbe the expedition on which he is bound, he finds it easy to transport\r\nwith him the stock from which he derives his subsistence. The whole\r\npeople is an army; the whole year a march. Such was the state of society\r\nwhich facilitated the gigantic conquests of Attila and Tamerlane.\r\n\r\nBut a people which subsists by the cultivation of the earth is in a very\r\ndifferent situation. The husbandman is bound to the soil on which he\r\nlabours. A long campaign would be ruinous to him. Still his pursuits\r\nare such as give to his frame both the active and the passive strength\r\nnecessary to a soldier. Nor do they, at least in the infancy of\r\nagricultural science, demand his uninterrupted attention. At particular\r\ntimes of the year he is almost wholly unemployed, and can, without\r\ninjury to himself, afford the time necessary for a short expedition.\r\nThus the legions of Rome were supplied during its earlier wars. The\r\nseason during which the fields did not require the presence of the\r\ncultivators sufficed for a short inroad and a battle. These operations,\r\ntoo frequently interrupted to produce {281}decisive results, yet served\r\nto keep up among the people a degree of discipline and courage which\r\nrendered them, not only secure, but formidable. The archers and billmen\r\nof the middle ages, who, with provisions for forty days at their backs,\r\nleft the fields for the camp, were troops of the same description.\r\n\r\nBut when commerce and manufactures begin to flourish a great change\r\ntakes place. The sedentary habits of the desk and the loom render the\r\nexertions and hardships of war insupportable. The business of traders\r\nand artisans requires their constant presence and attention. In such a\r\ncommunity there is little superfluous time; but there is generally much\r\nsuperfluous money. Some members of the society are, therefore, hired\r\nto relieve the rest from a task inconsistent with their habits and\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\nThe history of Greece is, in this, as in many other respects, the\r\nbest commentary on the history of Italy. Five hundred years before the\r\nChristian era, the citizens of the republics round the Ægean Sea formed\r\nperhaps the finest militia that ever existed. As wealth and refinement\r\nadvanced, the system underwent a gradual alteration. The Ionian States\r\nwere the first in which commerce and the arts were cultivated, and the\r\nfirst in which the ancient discipline decayed. Within eighty years\r\nafter the battle of Platæa, mercenary troops were every where plying for\r\nbattles and sieges. In the time of Demosthenes, it was scarcely possible\r\nto persuade or compel the Athenians to enlist for foreign service.\r\nThe laws of Lycurgus prohibited trade and manufactures. The Spartans,\r\ntherefore, continued to form a national force long after their\r\nneighbours had begun to hire soldiers. But their military spirit\r\ndeclined with their singular institutions. In {282}the second century\r\nbefore Christ, Greece contained only one nation of warriors, the savage\r\nhighlanders of Ætolia, who were some generations behind their countrymen\r\nin civilisation and intelligence.\r\n\r\nAll the causes which produced these effects among the Greeks acted still\r\nmore strongly on the modern Italians. Instead of a power like Sparta,\r\nin its nature warlike, they had amongst them an ecclesiastical state,\r\nin its nature pacific. Where there are numerous slaves, every freeman is\r\ninduced by the strongest motives to familiarise himself with the use of\r\narms. The commonwealths of Italy did not, like those of Greece, swarm\r\nwith thousands of these household enemies. Lastly, the mode in which\r\nmilitary operations were conducted during the prosperous times of Italy\r\nwas peculiarly unfavourable to the formation of an efficient militia.\r\nMen covered with iron from head to foot, armed with ponderous lances,\r\nand mounted on horses of the largest breed, were considered as composing\r\nthe strength of an army. The infantry was regarded as comparatively\r\nworthless, and was neglected till it became really so. These tactics\r\nmaintained their ground for centuries in most parts of Europe. That foot\r\nsoldiers could withstand the charge of heavy cavalry was thought utterly\r\nimpossible, till, towards the close of the fifteenth century, the rude\r\nmountaineers of Switzerland dissolved the spell, and astounded the most\r\nexperienced generals by receiving the dreaded shock on an impenetrable\r\nforest of pikes.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Grecian spear, the Roman sword, or the modern bayonet,\r\nmight be acquired with comparative ease. But nothing short of the daily\r\nexercise of years could train the man at arms to support his ponderous\r\npanoply, and manage his unwieldy weapon. Throughout {283}Europe this\r\nmost important branch of war became a separate profession. Beyond the\r\nAlps, indeed, though a profession, it was not generally a trade. It was\r\nthe duty and the amusement of a large class of country gentlemen. It was\r\nthe service by which they held their lands, and the diversion by which,\r\nin the absence of mental resources, they beguiled their leisure. But in\r\nthe Northern States of Italy, as we have already remarked, the growing\r\npower of the cities, where it had not exterminated this order of men,\r\nhad completely changed their habits. Here, therefore, the practice of\r\nemploying mercenaries became universal, at a time when it was almost\r\nunknown in other countries.\r\n\r\nWhen war becomes the trade of a separate class, the least dangerous\r\ncourse left to a government is to form that class into a standing army.\r\nIt is scarcely possible, that men can pass their lives in the service of\r\none state, without feeling some interest in its greatness. Its victories\r\nare their victories. Its defeats are their defeats. The contract loses\r\nsomething of its mercantile character. The services of the soldier are\r\nconsidered as the effects of patriotic zeal, his pay as the tribute of\r\nnational gratitude. To betray the power which employs him, to be even\r\nremiss in its service, are in his eyes the most atrocious and degrading\r\nof crimes.\r\n\r\nWhen the princes and commonwealths of Italy began to use hired\r\ntroops, their wisest course would have been to form separate military\r\nestablishments. Unhappily this was not done. The mercenary warriors of\r\nthe Peninsula, instead of being attached to the service of different\r\npowers, were regarded as the common property of all. The connection\r\nbetween the state and its defenders was reduced to the most simple and\r\nnaked traffic. The adventurer brought his horse, {284}his weapons,\r\nhis strength, and his experience, into the market. Whether the King of\r\nNaples or the Duke of Milan, the Pope or the Signory of Florence, struck\r\nthe bargain, was to him a matter of perfect indifference. He was for the\r\nhighest wages and the longest term. When the campaign for which he had\r\ncontracted was finished, there was neither law nor punctilio to prevent\r\nhim from instantly turning his arms against his late masters. The\r\nsoldier was altogether disjoined from the citizen and from the subject.\r\n\r\nThe natural consequences followed. Left to the conduct of men who\r\nneither loved those whom they defended, nor hated those whom they\r\nopposed, who were often bound by stronger ties to the army against\r\nwhich they fought than to the state which they served, who lost by\r\nthe termination of the conflict, and gained by its prolongation, war\r\ncompletely changed its character. Every man came into the field of\r\nbattle impressed with the knowledge that, in a few days, he might be\r\ntaking the pay of the power against which he was then employed,\r\nand fighting by the side of his enemies against his associates. The\r\nstrongest interests and the strongest feelings concurred to mitigate the\r\nhostility of those who had lately been brethren in arms, and who might\r\nsoon be brethren in arms once more. Their common profession was a bond\r\nof union not to be forgotten even when they were engaged in the service\r\nof contending parties. Hence it was that operations, languid and\r\nindecisive beyond any recorded in history, marches and countermarches,\r\npillaging expeditions and blockades, bloodless capitulations and equally\r\nbloodless combats, make up the military history of Italy during the\r\ncourse of nearly two centuries. Mighty armies fight from sunrise to\r\nsunset. A great {285}victory is won. Thousands of prisoners are taken;\r\nand hardly a life is lost. A pitched battle seems to have been really\r\nless dangerous than an ordinary civil tumult.\r\n\r\nCourage was now no longer necessary even to the military character.\r\nMen grew old in camps, and acquired the highest renown by their warlike\r\nachievements, without being once required to face serious danger.\r\nThe political consequences are too well known. The richest and most\r\nenlightened part of the world was left undefended to the assaults of\r\nevery barbarous invader, to the brutality of Switzerland, the insolence\r\nof France, and the fierce rapacity of Arragon. The moral effects which\r\nfollowed from this state of things were still more remarkable.\r\n\r\nAmong the rude nations which lay beyond the Alps, valour was absolutely\r\nindispensable. Without it none could be eminent; few could be secure.\r\nCowardice was, therefore, naturally considered as the foulest reproach.\r\nAmong the polished Italians, enriched by commerce, governed by law, and\r\npassionately attached to literature, every thing was done by superiority\r\nof intelligence. Their very wars, more pacific than the peace of their\r\nneighbours, required rather civil than military qualifications. Hence,\r\nwhile courage was the point of honour in other countries, ingenuity\r\nbecame the point of honour in Italy.\r\n\r\nFrom these principles were deduced, by processes strictly analogous, two\r\nopposite systems of fashionable morality. Through the greater part of\r\nEurope, the vices which peculiarly belong to timid dispositions, and\r\nwhich are the natural defence of weakness, fraud, and hypocrisy, have\r\nalways been most disreputable. On the other hand, the excesses of\r\nhaughty and daring {286}spirits have been treated with indulgence, and\r\neven with respect. The Italians regarded with corresponding lenity those\r\ncrimes which require self-command, address, quick observation, fertile\r\ninvention, and profound knowledge of human nature.\r\n\r\nSuch a prince as our Henry the Fifth would have been the idol of the\r\nNorth. The follies of his youth, the selfish ambition of his manhood,\r\nthe Lollards roasted at slow fires, the prisoners massacred on the\r\nfield of battle, the expiring lease of priestcraft renewed for another\r\ncentury, the dreadful legacy of a causeless and hopeless war bequeathed\r\nto a people who had no interest in its event, every thing is forgotten\r\nbut the victory of Agincourt. Francis Sforza, on the other hand, was the\r\nmodel of Italian heroes. He made his employers and his rivals alike his\r\ntools. He first overpowered his open enemies by the help of faithless\r\nallies; he then armed himself against his allies with the spoils taken\r\nfrom his enemies. By his incomparable dexterity, he raised himself from\r\nthe precarious and dependent situation of a military adventurer to\r\nthe first throne of Italy. To such a man much was forgiven, hollow\r\nfriendship, ungenerous enmity, violated faith. Such are the opposite\r\nerrors which men commit, when their morality is not a science but a\r\ntaste, when they abandon eternal principles for accidental associations.\r\n\r\nWe have illustrated our meaning by an instance taken from history. We\r\nwill select another from fiction. Othello murders his wife; he gives\r\norders for the murder of his lieutenant; he ends by murdering himself.\r\nYet he never loses the esteem and affection of Northern readers.\r\nHis intrepid and ardent spirit redeems every thing. The unsuspecting\r\nconfidence {287}with which he listens to his adviser, the agony with\r\nwhich he shrinks from the thought of shame, the tempest of passion with\r\nwhich he commits his crimes, and the haughty fearlessness with which he\r\navows them, give an extraordinary interest to his character. Iago, on\r\nthe contrary, is the object of universal loathing. Many are inclined to\r\nsuspect that Shakspeare has been seduced into an exaggeration unusual\r\nwith him, and has drawn a monster who has no archetype in human nature.\r\nNow we suspect that an Italian audience in the fifteenth century would\r\nhave felt very differently. Othello would have inspired nothing but\r\ndetestation and contempt. The folly with which he trusts the friendly\r\nprofessions of a man whose promotion he had obstructed, the credulity\r\nwith which he takes unsupported assertions, and trivial circumstances,\r\nfor unanswerable proofs, the violence with which he silences the\r\nexculpation till the exculpation can only aggravate his misery, would\r\nhave excited the abhorrence and disgust of the spectators. The conduct\r\nof Iago they would assuredly have condemned; but they would have\r\ncondemned it as we condemn that of his victim. Something of interest and\r\nrespect would have mingled with their disapprobation. The readiness of\r\nthe traitor’s wit, the clearness of his judgment, the skill with which\r\nhe penetrates the dispositions of others and conceals his own, would\r\nhave insured to him a certain portion of their esteem.\r\n\r\nSo wide was the difference between the Italians and their neighbours.\r\nA similar difference existed between the Greeks of the second century\r\nbefore Christ, and their masters the Romans. The conquerors, brave and\r\nresolute, faithful to their engagements, and strongly influenced by\r\nreligious feelings, were, at the same time. {288}ignorant, arbitrary,\r\nand cruel. With the vanquished people were deposited all the art,\r\nthe science, and the literature of the Western world. In poetry, in\r\nphilosophy, in painting, in architecture, in sculpture, they had no\r\nrivals. Their manners were polished, their perceptions acute, their\r\ninvention ready; they were tolerant, affable, humane; but of courage\r\nand sincerity they were almost utterly destitute. Every rude centurion\r\nconsoled himself for his intellectual inferiority, by remarking that\r\nknowledge and taste seemed only to make men atheists, cowards, and\r\nslaves. The distinction long continued to be strongly marked, and\r\nfurnished an admirable subject for the fierce sarcasms of Juvenal.\r\n\r\nThe citizen of an Italian commonwealth was the Greek of the time of\r\nJuvenal and the Greek of the time of Pericles, joined in one. Like the\r\nformer, he was timid and pliable, artful and mean. But, like the latter,\r\nhe had a country. Its independence and prosperity were dear to him. If\r\nhis character were degraded by some base crimes, it was, on the other\r\nhand, ennobled by public spirit and by an honourable ambition.\r\n\r\nA vice sanctioned by the general opinion is merely a vice. The evil\r\nterminates in itself. A vice condemned by the general opinion produces a\r\npernicious effect on the whole character. The former is a local malady,\r\nthe latter a constitutional taint. When the reputation of the offender\r\nis lost, he too often flings the remains of his virtue after it in\r\ndespair. The Highland gentleman who, a century ago, lived by taking\r\nblack mail from his neighbours, committed the same crime for which Wild\r\nwas accompanied to Tyburn by the huzzas of two hundred thousand people.\r\n{289}But there can be no doubt that he was a much less depraved man than\r\nWild. The deed for which Mrs. Brownrigg was hanged sinks into nothing,\r\nwhen compared with the conduct of the Roman who treated the public to a\r\nhundred pair of gladiators. Yet we should greatly wrong such a Roman if\r\nwe supposed that his disposition was as cruel as that of Mrs. Brownrigg.\r\n\r\nIn our own country, a woman forfeits her place in society by what, in\r\na man, is too commonly considered as an honourable distinction, and,\r\nat worst, as a venial error. The consequence is notorious. The moral\r\nprinciple of a woman is frequently more impaired by a single lapse\r\nfrom virtue than that of a man by twenty years of intrigues. Classical\r\nantiquity would furnish us with instances stronger, if possible, than\r\nthose to which we have referred.\r\n\r\nWe must apply this principle to the case before us. Habits of\r\ndissimulation and falsehood, no doubt, mark a man of our age and country\r\nas utterly worthless and abandoned. But it by no means follows that a\r\nsimilar judgment would be just in the case of an Italian in the middle\r\nages. On the contrary, we frequently find those faults which we are\r\naccustomed to consider as certain indications of a mind altogether\r\ndepraved, in company with great and good qualities, with generosity,\r\nwith benevolence, with disinterestedness. From such a state of\r\nsociety, Palamedes, in the admirable dialogue of Hume, might have drawn\r\nillustrations of his theory as striking as any of those with which\r\nFourli furnished him. These are not, we well know, the lessons which\r\nhistorians are generally most careful to teach, or readers most willing\r\nto learn. But they are not therefore useless. How Philip disposed his\r\ntroops at Cheronea, where Hannibal crossed the Alps, whether Mary blew\r\n{290}up Darnley, or Siquier shot Charles the Twelfth, and ten thousand\r\nother questions of the same description, are in themselves unimportant.\r\nThe inquiry may amuse us, but the decision leaves us no wiser. He\r\nalone reads history aright who, observing how powerfully circumstances\r\ninfluence the feelings and opinions of men, how often vices pass\r\ninto virtues and paradoxes into axioms, learns to distinguish what is\r\naccidental and transitory in human nature from what is essential and\r\nimmutable.\r\n\r\nIn this respect no history suggests more important reflections than that\r\nof the Tuscan and Lombard commonwealths. The character of the Italian\r\nstatesman seems, at first sight, a collection of contradictions, a\r\nphantom as monstrous as the portress of hell in Milton, half divinity,\r\nhalf snake, majestic and beautiful above, grovelling and poisonous\r\nbelow. We see a man whose thoughts and words have no connection with\r\neach other, who never hesitates at an oath when he wishes to seduce,\r\nwho never wants a pretext when he is inclined to betray. His cruelties\r\nspring, not from the heat of blood, or the insanity of uncontrolled\r\npower, but from deep and cool meditation. His passions, like\r\nwell-trained troops, are impetuous by rule, and in their most headstrong\r\nfury never forget the discipline to which they have been accustomed. His\r\nwhole soul is occupied with vast and complicated schemes of ambition:\r\nyet his aspect and language exhibit nothing but philosophical\r\nmoderation. Hatred and revenge eat into his heart: yet every look is\r\na cordial smile, every gesture a familiar caress. He never excites\r\nthe suspicion of his adversaries by petty provocations. His purpose\r\nis disclosed only when it is accomplished. His face is unruffled, his\r\nspeech is courteous, till vigilance is laid {291}asleep, till a vital\r\npoint is exposed, till a sure aim is taken; and then he strikes for the\r\nfirst and last time. Military courage, the boast of the sottish German,\r\nof the frivolous and prating Frenchman, of the romantic and arrogant\r\nSpaniard, he neither possesses nor values. He shuns danger, not because\r\nhe is insensible to shame, but because, in the society in which he\r\nlives, timidity has ceased to be shameful. To do an injury openly is, in\r\nhis estimation, as wicked as to do it secretly, and far less profitable.\r\nWith him the most honourable means are those which are the surest,\r\nthe speediest, and the darkest. He cannot comprehend how a man should\r\nscruple to deceive those whom he does not scruple to destroy. He would\r\nthink it madness to declare open hostilities against rivals whom he\r\nmight stab in a friendly embrace, or poison in a consecrated wafer.\r\n\r\nYet this man, black with the vices which we consider as most loathsome,\r\ntraitor, hypocrite, coward, assassin, was by no means destitute even\r\nof those virtues which we generally consider as indicating superior\r\nelevation of character. In civil courage, in perseverance, in presence\r\nof mind, those barbarous warriors, who were foremost in the battle or\r\nthe breach, were far his inferiors. Even the dangers which he avoided\r\nwith a caution almost pusillanimous never confused his perceptions,\r\nnever paralysed his inventive faculties, never wrung out one secret from\r\nhis smooth tongue, and his inscrutable brow. Though a dangerous enemy,\r\nand a still more dangerous accomplice, he could be a just and beneficent\r\nruler. With so much unfairness in his policy, there was an extraordinary\r\ndegree of fairness in his intellect. Indifferent to truth in the\r\ntransactions of life, he was honestly devoted to truth in the researches\r\nof speculation. Wanton cruelty was not in his nature. {292}On the\r\ncontrary, where no political object was at stake, his disposition was\r\nsoft and humane. The susceptibility of his nerves and the activity of\r\nhis imagination inclined him to sympathise with the feelings of\r\nothers, and to delight in the charities and courtesies of social life.\r\nPerpetually descending to actions which might seem to mark a mind\r\ndiseased through all its faculties, he had nevertheless an exquisite\r\nsensibility, both for the natural and the moral sublime, for every\r\ngraceful and every lofty conception. Habits of petty intrigue and\r\ndissimulation might have rendered him incapable of great general views,\r\nbut that the expanding effect of his philosophical studies counteracted\r\nthe narrowing tendency. He had the keenest enjoyment of wit, eloquence,\r\nand poetry. The fine arts profited alike by the severity of his\r\njudgment, and by the liberality of his patronage. The portraits of some\r\nof the remarkable Italians of those times are perfectly in harmony with\r\nthis description. Ample and majestic ^ foreheads, brows strong and dark,\r\nbut not frowning, eyes of which the calm full gaze, while it expresses\r\nnothing, seems to discern every thing, cheeks pale with thought and\r\nsedentary habits, lips formed with feminine delicacy, but compressed\r\nwith more than masculine decision, mark out men at once enterprising and\r\ntimid, men equally skilled in detecting the purposes of others, and\r\nin concealing their own, men who must have been formidable enemies and\r\nunsafe allies, but men, at the same time, whose tempers were mild and\r\nequable, and who possessed an amplitude and subtlety of intellect which\r\nwould have rendered them eminent either in active or in contemplative\r\nlife, and fitted them either to govern or to instruct mankind.\r\n\r\nEvery age and every nation has certain characteristic {293}vices, which\r\nprevail almost universally, which scarcely any person scruples to\r\navow, and which even rigid moralists but faintly censure. Succeeding\r\ngenerations change the fashion of their morals, with the fashion of\r\ntheir hats and their coaches; take some other kind of wickedness under\r\ntheir patronage, and wonder at the depravity of their ancestors. Nor is\r\nthis all. Posterity, that high court of appeal which is never tired of\r\neulogising its own justice and discernment, acts on such occasions like\r\na Roman dictator after a general mutiny. Finding the delinquents too\r\nnumerous to be all punished, it selects some of them at hazard, to\r\nhear the whole penalty of an offence in which they are not more deeply\r\nimplicated than those who escape. Whether decimation be a convenient\r\nmode of military execution, we know not; but we solemnly protest against\r\nthe introduction of such a principle into the philosophy of history.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance, the lot has fallen on Machavelli, a man whose\r\npublic conduct was upright and honourable, whose views of morality,\r\nwhere they differed from those of the persons around him, seemed to have\r\ndiffered for the better, and whose only fault was, that, having adopted\r\nsome of the maxims then generally received, he arranged them more\r\nluminously, and expressed them more forcibly, than any other writer.\r\n\r\nHaving now, we hope, in some degree cleared the personal character of\r\nMachiavelli, we come to the consideration of his works. As a poet he is\r\nnot entitled to a high place; but his comedies deserve attention.\r\n\r\nThe Mandragola, in particular, is superior to the best of Goldoni, and\r\ninferior only to the best of Molière. It is the work of a man who, if he\r\nhad devoted himself to the drama, would probably have attained {294}the\r\nhighest eminence, and produced a permanent and salutary effect on the\r\nnational taste. This we infer, not so much from the degree, as from\r\nthe kind of its excellence. There are compositions which indicate still\r\ngreater talent, and which are perused with still greater delight, from\r\nwhich we should have drawn very different conclusions. Books quite\r\nworthless are quite harmless. The sure sign of the general decline of\r\nan art is the frequent occurrence, not of deformity, but of misplaced\r\nbeauty. In general, Tragedy is corrupted by eloquence, and Comedy by\r\nwit.\r\n\r\nThe real object of the drama is the exhibition of human character. This,\r\nwe conceive, is no arbitrary canon, originating in local and temporary\r\nassociations, like those canons which regulate the number of acts in\r\na play, or of syllables in a line. To this fundamental law every other\r\nregulation is subordinate. The situations which most signally develop\r\ncharacter form the best plot. The mother tongue of the passions is the\r\nbest style.\r\n\r\nThis principle, rightly understood, does not debar the poet from any\r\ngrace of composition. There is no style in which some man may not, under\r\nsome circumstances, express himself. There is therefore no style which\r\nthe drama rejects, none which it does not occasionally require. It is\r\nin the discernment of place, of time, and of person, that the inferior\r\nartists fail. The fantastic rhapsody of Mercutio, the elaborate\r\ndeclamation of Antony, are, where Shakspeare has placed them, natural\r\nand pleasing. But Dryden would have made Mer-cutio challenge Tybalt in\r\nhyperboles as fanciful as those in which he describes the chariot of\r\nMab. Corneille would have represented Antony as scolding and coaxing\r\nCleopatra with all the measured rhetoric of a funeral oration. {295}No\r\nwriters have injured the Comedy of England so deeply as Congreve and\r\nSheridan. Both were men of splendid wit and polished taste. Unhappily,\r\nthey made all their characters in their own likeness. Their works bear\r\nthe same relation to the legitimate drama, which a transparency bears to\r\na painting. There are no delicate touches, no hues imperceptibly fading\r\ninto each other: the whole is lighted up with an universal glare.\r\nOutlines and tints are forgotten in the common blaze whicli illuminates\r\nall. The flowers and fruits of the intellect abound; but it is the\r\nabundance of a jungle, not of a garden, unwholesome, bewildering,\r\nunprofitable from its very plenty, rank from its very fragrance. Every\r\nfop, every boor, every valet, is a man of wit. The very butts and dupes,\r\nTattle, Witwould, Puff, Acres, outshine the whole Hotel of Rambouillet.\r\nTo prove the whole system of this school erroneous, it is only necessary\r\nto apply the test which dissolved the enchanted Florimel, to place the\r\ntrue by the false Thalia, to contrast the most celebrated characters\r\nwhich have been drawn by the writers of whom we speak with the Bastard\r\nin King John, or the Nurse in Romeo and Juliet. It was not surely from\r\nwant of wit that Shakspeare adopted so different a manner. Benedick\r\nand Beatrice throw Mirabel and Millamant into the shade. All the good\r\nsayings of the facetious houses of Absolute and Surface might have been\r\nclipped from the single character of Falstaff without being missed. It\r\nwould have been easy for that fertile mind to have given Bardolph and\r\nShallow as much wit as Prince Hal, and to have made Dogberry and Verges\r\nretort on each other in sparkling epigrams. But he knew that such\r\nindiscriminate prodigality was, to use his own admirable language, “from\r\nthe purpose of playing, whose end, {296}both at the first and now, was,\r\nand is, to hold, as it were, the mirror up to Nature.”\r\n\r\nThis digression will enable our readers to understand what we mean when\r\nwe say that in the Mandragola, Machiavelli has proved that he completely\r\nunderstood the nature of the dramatic art, and possessed talents which\r\nwould have enabled him to excel in it. By the correct and vigorous\r\ndelineation of human nature, it produces interest without a pleasing or\r\nskilful plot, and laughter without the least ambition of wit. The lover,\r\nnot a very delicate or generous lover, and his adviser the parasite, are\r\ndrawn with spirit. The hypocritical confessor is an admirable portrait.\r\nHe is, if we mistake not, the original of Father Dominic, the best comic\r\ncharacter of Dryden. But old Nicias is the glory of the piece. We cannot\r\ncall to mind any thing that resembles him. The follies which Molière\r\nridicules are those of affectation, not those of fatuity. Coxcombs and\r\npedants, not absolute simpletons, are his game. Shakspeare has indeed a\r\nvast assortment of fools; but the precise species of which we speak is\r\nnot, if we remember right, to be found there. Shallow is a fool. But\r\nhis animal spirits supply, to a certain degree, the place of cleverness.\r\nHis talk is to that of Sir John what soda water is to champagne. It has\r\nthe effervescence though not the body or the flavour. Slender and Sir\r\nAndrew Aguecheek are fools, troubled with an uneasy consciousness of\r\ntheir folly, which, in the latter produces meekness and docility, and in\r\nthe former, awkwardness, obstinacy, and confusion. Cloten is an arrogant\r\nfool, Osric a foppish fool, Ajax a savage fool; but Nicias is, as\r\nThersites says of Patroclus, a fool positive. His mind is occupied by no\r\nstrong feeling; it takes every character, and retains none; its aspect\r\nis {297}diversified, not by passions, but by faint and transitory\r\nsemblances of passion, a mock joy, a mock fear, a mock love, a mock\r\npride, which chase each other like shadows over its surface, and vanish\r\nas soon as they appear. He is just idiot enough to be an object, not\r\nof pity or horror, but of ridicule. He bears some resemblance to poor\r\nCalandrino, whose mishaps, as recounted by Boccaccio, have made all\r\nEurope merry for more than four centuries. He perhaps resembles still\r\nmore closely Simon da Villa, to whom Bruno and Buffalmacco promised\r\nthe love of the Countess Civilian. Nicias is, like Simon, of a learned\r\nprofession; and the dignity with which he wears the doctoral fur,\r\nrenders his absurdities infinitely more grotesque. The old Tuscan is the\r\nvery language for such a being. Its peculiar simplicity gives even to\r\nthe most forcible reasoning and the most brilliant wit an infantine\r\nair, generally delightful, but to a foreign reader sometimes a little\r\nludicrous. Heroes and statesmen seem to lisp when they use it. It\r\nbecomes Nicias incomparably, and renders all his silliness infinitely\r\nmore silly.\r\n\r\nWe may add, that the verses with which the Man-dragola is interspersed,\r\nappear to us to be the most spirited and correct of all that Machiavelli\r\nhas written in metre. He seems to have entertained the same opinion; for\r\nhe has introduced some of them in other places. The contemporaries of\r\nthe author were not blind to the merits of this striking piece. It was\r\nacted at Florence with the greatest success. Leo the Tenth was among its\r\nadmirers, and by his order it was represented at Rome. (1)\r\n\r\n     (1) Nothing can be more evident than that Paulus Jovius\r\n     designates the Mandragola under the name of the Nicias. We\r\n     should not have noticed what is so perfectly obvious, were\r\n     it not that this natural and palpable misnomer has led the\r\n     sagacious and industrious Bayle into a gross error.\r\n\r\n{298}The Clizia is an imitation of the Casina of Plautus, which is\r\nitself an imitation of the lost (work) of Diphilus. Plautus was,\r\nunquestionably, one of the best Latin writers; but the Casina is by no\r\nmeans one of his best plays; nor is it one which offers great facilities\r\nto an imitator. The story is as alien from modern habits of life, as the\r\nmanner in which it is developed from the modern fashion of composition.\r\nThe lover remains in the country and the heroine in her chamber during\r\nthe whole action, leaving; their fate to be decided by a foolish\r\nfather, a cunning mother, and two knavish servants. Machiavelli has\r\nexecuted his task with judgment and taste. He has accommodated the plot\r\nto a different state of society, and has very dexterously connected it\r\nwith the history of his own times. The relation of the trick put on\r\nthe doting old lover is exquisitely humorous. It is far superior to the\r\ncorresponding passage in the Latin comedy, and scarcely yields to the\r\naccount which Falstaff gives of his ducking.\r\n\r\nTwo other comedies without titles, the one in prose, the other in verse,\r\nappear among the works of Machiavelli. The former is very short, lively\r\nenough, but of no great value. The latter we can scarcely believe to\r\nbe genuine. Neither its merits nor its defects remind us of the reputed\r\nauthor. It was first printed in 1796, from a manuscript discovered in\r\nthe celebrated library of the Strozzi. Its genuineness, if we have been\r\nrightly informed, is established solely by the comparison of hands.\r\nOur suspicions are strengthened by the circumstance, that the same\r\nmanuscript contained a description of the plague of 1527, which has\r\nalso, in consequence, been added to the works of Machiavelli. Of this\r\nlast composition, the strongest {299}external evidence would scarcely\r\ninduce us to believe him guilty. Nothing was ever written more\r\ndetestable in matter and manner. The narrations, the reflections, the\r\njokes, the lamentations, are all the very worst of their respective\r\nkinds, at once trite and affected, threadbare tinsel from the Rag Fairs\r\nand Monmouth Streets of literature. A foolish schoolboy might write\r\nsuch a piece, and, after he had written it, think it much finer than the\r\nincomparable introduction of the Decameron. But that a shrewd statesman,\r\nwhose earliest works are characterised by manliness of thought and\r\nlanguage, should, at near sixty years of age, descend to such puerility,\r\nis utterly inconceivable.\r\n\r\nThe little novel of Belphegor is pleasantly conceived, and pleasantly\r\ntold. But the extravagance of the satire in some measure injures its\r\neffect. Machiavelli was unhappily married; and his wish to avenge his\r\nown cause and that of his brethren in misfortune, carried him beyond\r\neven the licence of fiction. Jonson seems to have combined some hints\r\ntaken from this tale, with others from Boccaccio, in the plot of The\r\nDevil is an Ass, a play which, though not the most highly finished of\r\nhis compositions, is perhaps that which exhibits the strongest proofs of\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nThe political correspondence of Machiavelli, first published in 1767, is\r\nunquestionably genuine, and highly valuable. The unhappy circumstances\r\nin which his country was placed during the greater part of his public\r\nlife gave extraordinary encouragement to diplomatic talents. From\r\nthe moment that Charles the Eighth descended from the Alps, the whole\r\ncharacter of Italian politics was changed. The governments of the\r\nPeninsula ceased to form an independent system. Drawn from their old\r\norbit by the attraction of the {300}larger bodies which now approached\r\nthem, they became mere satellites of France and Spain. All their\r\ndisputes, internal and external, were decided by foreign influence. The\r\ncontests of opposite factions were carried on, not as formerly in the\r\nsenate-house or in the market-place, but in the antechambers of Louis\r\nand Ferdinand. Under these circumstances, the prosperity of the Italian\r\nStates depended far more on the ability of their foreign agents, than\r\non the conduct of those who were intrusted with the domestic\r\nadministration. The ambassador had to discharge functions far more\r\ndelicate than transmitting orders of knighthood, introducing tourists,\r\nor presenting his brethren with the homage of his high consideration. He\r\nwas an advocate to whose management the dearest interests of his clients\r\nwere intrusted, a spy clothed with an inviolable character. Instead of\r\nconsulting, by a reserved manner and ambiguous style, the dignity of\r\nthose whom he represented, he was to plunge into all the intrigues of\r\nthe court at which he resided, to discover and flatter every weakness\r\nof the prince, and of the favourite who governed the prince, and of the\r\nlacquey who governed the favourite. He was to compliment the mistress\r\nand bribe the confessor, to panegyrize or supplicate, to laugh or weep,\r\nto accommodate himself to every caprice, to lull every suspicion, to\r\ntreasure every hint, to be every thing, to observe every thing, to\r\nendure every thing. High as the art of political intrigue had been\r\ncarried in Italy, these were times which required it all.\r\n\r\nOn these arduous errands Machiavelli was frequently employed. He\r\nwas sent to treat with the King of the Romans and with the Duke of\r\nValentinois. He was twice ambassador at the Court of Rome, and thrice\r\nat {301}that of France. In these missions, and in several others of\r\ninferior importance, he acquitted himself with great dexterity. His\r\ndespatches form one of the most amusing and instructive collections\r\nextant. The narratives are clear and agreeably written; the remarks on\r\nmen and things clever and judicious. The conversations are reported in\r\na spirited and characteristic manner. We find ourselves introduced into\r\nthe presence of the men who, during twenty eventful years, swayed the\r\ndestinies of Europe. Their wit and their folly, their fretfulness and\r\ntheir merriment, are exposed to us. We are admitted to overhear their\r\nchat, and to watch their familiar gestures. It is interesting and\r\ncurious to recognise, in circumstances which elude the notice of\r\nhistorians, the feeble violence and shallow cunning of Louis the\r\nTwelfth; the bustling insignificance of Maximilian, cursed with an\r\nimpotent pruriency for renown, rash yet timid, obstinate yet fickle,\r\nalways in a hurry, yet always too late; the fierce and haughty energy\r\nwhich gave dignity to the eccentricities of Julius; the soft and\r\ngraceful manners which masked the insatiable ambition and the implacable\r\nhatred of Cæsar Borgia.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned Cæsar Borgia. It is impossible not to pause for a\r\nmoment on the name of a man in whom the political morality of Italy was\r\nso strongly personified, partially blended with the sterner lineaments\r\nof the Spanish character. On two important occasions Machiavelli was\r\nadmitted to his society; once, at the moment when Cæsar’s splendid\r\nvillany achieved its most signal triumph, when he caught in one snare\r\nand crushed at one blow all his most formidable rivals; and again when,\r\nexhausted by disease and overwhelmed by misfortunes, which no human\r\nprudence {302}could have averted, he was the prisoner of the deadliest\r\nenemy of his house. These interviews between the greatest speculative\r\nand the greatest practical statesmen of the age are folly described in\r\nthe Correspondence, and form perhaps the most interesting part of it.\r\nFrom some passages in The Prince, and perhaps also from some indistinct\r\ntraditions, several writers have supposed a connection between those\r\nremarkable men much closer than ever existed. The Envoy has even been\r\naccused of prompting the crimes of the artful and merciless tyrant. But\r\nfrom the official documents it is clear that their intercourse, though\r\nostensibly amicable, was in reality hostile. It cannot be doubted,\r\nhowever, that the imagination of Machiavelli was strongly impressed, and\r\nhis speculations on government coloured, by the observations which he\r\nmade on the singular character and equally singular fortunes of a man\r\nwho under such disadvantages had achieved such exploits; who, when\r\nsensuality, varied through innumerable forms, could no longer stimulate\r\nhis sated mind, found a more powerful and durable excitement in the\r\nintense thirst of empire and revenge; who emerged from the sloth and\r\nluxury of the Roman purple the first prince and general of the age; who,\r\ntrained in an unwarlike profession, formed a gallant army out of the\r\ndregs of an unwarlike people; who, after acquiring sovereignty by\r\ndestroying his enemies, acquired popularity by destroying his tools; who\r\nhad begun to employ for the most salutary ends the power which he had\r\nattained by the most atrocious means; who tolerated within the sphere of\r\nhis iron despotism no plunderer or oppressor but himself; and who fell\r\nat last amidst the mingled curses and regrets of a people of whom his\r\ngenius had been the wonder, and might {303}have been the salvation. Some\r\nof those crimes of Borgia which to ns appear the most odious would not,\r\nfrom causes which we have already considered, have struck an Italian of\r\nthe fifteenth century with equal horror. Patriotic feeling also might\r\ninduce Machiavelli to look with some indulgence and regret on the o o\r\nmemory of the only leader who could have defended the independence of\r\nItaly against the confederate spoilers of Cambray.\r\n\r\nOn this subject Machiavelli felt most strongly. Indeed the expulsion of\r\nthe foreign tyrants, and the restoration of that golden age which had\r\npreceded the irruption of Charles the Eighth, were projects which, at\r\nthat time, fascinated all the master-spirits of Italy. The magnificent\r\nvision delighted the great but ill-regulated mind of Julius. It divided\r\nwith manuscripts and sauces, painters and falcons, the attention of the\r\nfrivolous Leo. It prompted the generous treason of Morone. It imparted\r\na transient energy to the feeble mind and body of the last Sforza. It\r\nexcited for one moment an honest ambition in the false heart of\r\nPescara. Ferocity and insolence were not among the vices of the national\r\ncharacter. To the discriminating Cruelties of politicians, committed\r\nfor great ends on select victims, the moral code of the Italians was\r\ntoo indulgent. But though they might have recourse to barbarity as an\r\nexpedient, they did not require it as a stimulant. They turned with\r\nloathing from the atrocity of the strangers who seemed to love blood\r\nfor its own sake, who, not content with subjugating, were impatient to\r\ndestroy, who found a fiendish pleasure in razing magnificent cities,\r\ncutting the throats of enemies who cried for quarter, or suffocating\r\nan unarmed population by thousands in the caverns to which it had fled\r\n{304}for safety. Such were the cruelties which daily excited the terror\r\nand disgust of a people among whom, till lately, the worst that a\r\nsoldier had to fear in a pitched battle was the loss of his horse and\r\nthe expense of his ransom. The swinish intemperance of Switzerland,\r\nthe wolfish avarice of Spain, the gross licentiousness of the French,\r\nindulged in violation of hospitality, of decency, of love itself, the\r\nwanton inhumanity which was common to all the invaders, had made them\r\nobjects of deadly hatred to the inhabitants of the Peninsula. The wealth\r\nwhich had been accumulated during centuries of prosperity and repose\r\nwas rapidly melting away. The intellectual superiority of the oppressed\r\npeople only rendered them more keenly sensible of their political\r\ndegradation. Literature and taste, indeed, still disguised with a flush\r\nof hectic loveliness and brilliancy the ravages of an incurable decay.\r\nThe iron had not yet entered into the soul. The time was not yet come\r\nwhen eloquence was to be gagged, and reason to be hoodwinked, when the\r\nharp of the poet was to be hung on the willows of Arno, and the right\r\nhand of the painter to forget its cunning. Yet a discerning eye might\r\neven then have seen that genius and learning would not long survive the\r\nstate of things from which they had sprung, and that the great men whose\r\ntalents gave lustre to that melancholy period had been formed under the\r\ninfluence of happier days, and would leave no successors behind them.\r\nThe times which shine with the greatest splendour in literary history\r\nare not always those to which the human mind is most indebted. Of this\r\nwe may be convinced, by comparing the generation which follows them with\r\nthat which had preceded them. The first fruits which are reaped under\r\na bad system often spring from seed {305}sown under a good one. Thus it\r\nwas, in some measure, with the Augustan age. Thus it was with the age of\r\nRaphael and Ariosto, of Aldus and Vida.\r\n\r\nMachiavelli deeply regretted the misfortunes of his country, and clearly\r\ndiscerned the cause and the remedy. It was the military system of the\r\nItalian people which had extinguished their valor and discipline, and\r\nleft their wealth an easy prey to every foreign plunderer. The Secretary\r\nprojected a scheme alike honourable to his heart and to his intellect,\r\nfor abolishing the use of mercenary troops, and for organizing a\r\nnational militia.\r\n\r\nThe exertions which he made to effect this great object ought alone to\r\nrescue his name from obloquy. Though his situation and his habits were\r\npacific, he studied with intense assiduity the theory of war. He made\r\nhimself master of all its details. The Florentine government entered\r\ninto his views. A council of war was appointed. Levies were decreed. The\r\nindefatigable minister flew from place to place in order to superintend\r\nthe execution of his design. The times were, in some respects,\r\nfavourable to the experiment. The system of military tactics had\r\nundergone a great revolution. The cavalry was no longer considered as\r\nforming the strength of an army. The hours which a citizen could\r\nspare from his ordinary employments, though by no means sufficient to\r\nfamiliarise him with the exercise of a man-at-arms, might render him an\r\nuseful foot-soldier. The dread of a foreign yoke, of plunder, massacre,\r\nand conflagration, might have conquered that repugnance to military\r\npursuits which both the industry and the idleness of great towns\r\ncommonly generate. For a time the scheme promised well. The new troops\r\nacquitted themselves respectably in the {306}field. Machiavelli looked\r\nwith parental rapture on the success of his plan, and began to hope that\r\nthe arms of Italy might once more be formidable to the barbarians of\r\nthe Tagus and the Rhine. But the tide of misfortune came on before\r\nthe barriers which should have withstood it were prepared. For a time,\r\nindeed, Florence might be considered as peculiarly fortunate. Famine\r\nand sword and pestilence had devastated the fertile plains and stately\r\ncities of the Po. All the curses denounced of old against Tyre seemed to\r\nhave fallen on Venice. Her merchants already stood afar off, lamenting\r\nfor their great city. The time seemed near when the sea-weed should\r\novergrow her silent Rialto, and the fisherman wash his nets in her\r\ndeserted arsenal. Naples had been four times conquered and reconquered\r\nby tyrants equally indifferent to its welfare, and equally greedy\r\nfor its spoils. Florence, as yet, had only to endure degradation and\r\nextortion, to submit to the mandates of foreign powers, to buy over and\r\nover again, at an enormous price, what was already justly her own, to\r\nreturn thanks for being wronged, and to ask pardon for being in the\r\nright. She was at length deprived of the blessings even of this infamous\r\nand servile repose. Her military and political institutions were swept\r\naway together. The Medici returned, in the train of foreign invaders,\r\nfrom their long exile. The policy of Machiavelli was abandoned; and his\r\npublic services were requited with poverty, imprisonment, and torture.\r\n\r\nThe fallen statesman still clung to his project with unabated ardour.\r\nWith the view of vindicating it from some popular objections and of\r\nrefuting some prevailing errors on the subject of military science, he\r\nwrote his seven books on the Art of War. This excellent {307}work is\r\nin the form of a dialogue. The opinions of the writer are put into the\r\nmouth of Fabrizio Colonna, a powerful nobleman of the Ecclesiastical\r\nState, and an officer of distinguished merit in the service of the King\r\nof Spain. Colonna visits Florence on his way from Lombardy to his own\r\ndomains. He is invited to meet some friends at the house of Cosimo\r\nRucellai, an amiable and accomplished young man, whose early death\r\nMachiavelli feelingly deplores. After partaking of an elegant\r\nentertainment, they retire from the heat into the most shady recesses\r\nof the garden. Fabrizio is struck by the sight of some uncommon plants.\r\nCosimo says that, though rare, in modern days, they are frequently\r\nmentioned by the classical authors, and that his grandfather, like many\r\nother Italians, amused himself with practising the ancient methods of\r\ngardening. Fabrizio expresses his regret that those who, in later times,\r\naffected the manners of the old Romans should select for imitation the\r\nmost trifling pursuits. This leads to a conversation on the decline\r\nof military discipline and on the best means of restoring it. The\r\ninstitution of the Florentine militia is ably defended; and several\r\nimprovements are suggested in the details.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss and the Spaniards were, at that time, regarded as the best\r\nsoldiers in Europe. The Swiss battalion consisted of pikemen, and bore a\r\nclose resemblance to the Greek phalanx. The Spaniards, like the soldiers\r\nof Rome, were armed with the sword and the shield. The victories of\r\nFlamininus and Æmilius over the Macedonian kings seem to prove the\r\nsuperiority of the weapons used by the legions. The same experiment had\r\nbeen recently tried with the same result at the battle of Ravenna, one\r\nof those {308}tremendous days into which human folly and wickedness\r\ncompress the whole devastation of a famine or a plague. In that\r\nmemorable conflict, the infantry of Arragon, the old companions of\r\nGonsalvo, deserted by all their allies, hewed a passage through the\r\nthickest of the imperial pikes, and effected an unbroken retreat, in the\r\nface of the gendarmerie of De Foix, and the renowned artillery of Este.\r\nFabrizio, or rather Machiavelli, proposes to combine the two systems,\r\nto arm the foremost lines with the pike for the purpose of repulsing\r\ncavalry, and those in the rear with the sword, as being a weapon\r\nbetter adapted for every other purpose. Throughout the work, the author\r\nexpresses the highest admiration of the military science of the ancient\r\nRomans, and the greatest contempt for the maxims which had been in vogue\r\namongst the Italian commanders of the preceding generation. He prefers\r\ninfantry to cavalry, and fortified camps to fortified towns. He is\r\ninclined to substitute rapid movements and decisive engagements for\r\nthe languid and dilatory operations of his countrymen. He attaches very\r\nlittle importance to the invention of gunpowder. Indeed he seems to\r\nthink that it ought scarcely to produce any change in the mode of arming\r\nor of disposing troops. The general testimony of historians, it must\r\nbe allowed, seems to prove that the ill-constructed and ill-served\r\nartillery of those times, though useful in a siege, was of little value\r\non the field of battle.\r\n\r\nOf the tactics of Machiavelli we will not venture to give an opinion:\r\nbut we are certain that his book is most able and interesting. As a\r\ncommentary on the history of his times, it is invaluable. The ingenuity,\r\nthe grace, and the perspicuity of the style, and the {309}eloquence and\r\nanimation of particular passages, must give pleasure even to readers who\r\ntake no interest in the subject.\r\n\r\nThe Prince and the Discourses on Livy were written after the fall of the\r\nRepublican Government. The former was dedicated to the Young Lorenzo de’\r\nMedici. This circumstance seems to have disgusted the contemporaries of\r\nthe writer far more than the doctrines which have rendered the name of\r\nthe work odious in later times. It was considered as an indication\r\nof political apostasy. The fact however seems to have been that\r\nMachiavelli, despairing of the liberty of Florence, was inclined to\r\nsupport any government which might preserve her independence. The\r\ninterval which separated a democracy and a despotism, Soderini and\r\nLorenzo, seemed to vanish when compared with the difference between\r\nthe former and the present state of Italy, between the security, the\r\nopulence, and the repose which she had enjoyed under its native rulers,\r\nand the misery in which she had been plunged since the fatal year in\r\nwhich the first foreign tyrant had descended from the Alps. The noble\r\nand pathetic exhortation with which The Prince concludes shows how\r\nstrongly the writer felt upon this subject.\r\n\r\nThe Prince traces the progress of an ambitious man, the Discourses the\r\nprogress of an ambitious people. The same principles on which, in the\r\nformer work, the elevation of an individual is explained, are applied\r\nin the latter, to the longer duration and more complex interest of a\r\nsociety. To a modern statesman the form of the Discourses may appear to\r\nbe puerile. In truth Livy is not an historian on whom implicit reliance\r\ncan be placed, even in cases where he must have possessed considerable\r\nmeans of {310}information. And the first Decade, to which Machiavelli\r\nhas confined himself, is scarcely entitled to more credit than our\r\nChronicle of British Kings who reigned before the Roman invasion. But\r\nthe commentator is indebted to Livy for little more than a few texts\r\nwhich he might as easily have extracted from the Vulgate or the\r\nDecameron. The whole train of thought is original.\r\n\r\nOn the peculiar immorality which has rendered The Prince unpopular, and\r\nwhich is almost equally discernible in the Discourses, we have already\r\ngiven our opinion at length. We have attempted to show that it belonged\r\nrather to the age than to the man, that it was a partial taint, and by\r\nno means implied general depravity. We cannot however deny that it is a\r\ngreat blemish, and that it considerably diminishes the pleasure which,\r\nin other respects, those works must afford to every intelligent mind.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, impossible to conceive a more healthful and vigorous\r\nconstitution of the understanding than that which these works indicate.\r\nThe qualities of the active and the contemplative statesman appear to\r\nhave been blended in the mind of the writer into a rare and exquisite\r\nharmony. His skill in the details of business had not been acquired at\r\nthe expense of his general powers. It had not rendered his mind less\r\ncomprehensive; but it had served to correct his speculations, and\r\nto impart to them that vivid and practical character which so\r\nwidely distinguishes them from the vague theories of most political\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\nEvery man who has seen the world knows that nothing is so useless as\r\na general maxim. If it be very moral and very true, it may serve for a\r\ncopy to a charity-boy. If, like those of Rochefoucault, it be sparkling\r\nand whimsical, it may make an excellent {311}motto for an essay. But few\r\nindeed of the many wise apophthegms which have been uttered, from\r\nthe time of the Seven Sages of Greece to that of Poor Richard, have\r\nprevented a single foolish action. We give the highest and the most\r\npeculiar praise to the precepts of Machiavelli when we say that they\r\nmay frequently be of real use in regulating conduct, not so much because\r\nthey are more just or more profound than those which might be culled\r\nfrom other authors, as because they can be more readily applied to the\r\nproblems of real life.\r\n\r\nThere are errors in these works. But they are errors which a writer,\r\nsituated like Machiavelli, could scarcely avoid. They arise, for the\r\nmost part, from a single defect which appears to us to pervade his\r\nwhole system. In his political scheme, the means had been more deeply\r\nconsidered than the ends. The great principle, that societies and laws\r\nexist only for the purpose of increasing the sum of private happiness,\r\nis not recognised with sufficient clearness. The good of the body,\r\ndistinct from the good of the members, and sometimes hardly compatible\r\nwith the good of the members, seems to be the object which he proposes\r\nto himself. Of all political fallacies, this has perhaps had the widest\r\nand the most mischievous operation. The state of society in the little\r\ncommonwealths of Greece, the close connection and mutual dependence of\r\nthe citizens, and the severity of the laws of war, tended to encourage\r\nan opinion which, under such circumstances, could hardly be called\r\nerroneous. The interests of every individual were inseparably bound\r\nup with those of the state. An invasion destroyed his corn-fields and\r\nvineyards, drove him from his home, and compelled him to encounter all\r\nthe hardships of a military {312}life. A treaty of peace restored him\r\nto security and comfort. A victory doubled the number of his slaves.\r\nA defeat perhaps made him a slave himself. When Pericles, in the\r\nPeloponnesian war, told the Athenians, that, if their country triumphed,\r\ntheir private losses would speedily be repaired, but that, if their\r\narms failed of success, every individual amongst them would probably\r\nbe ruined, he spoke no more than the truth. He spoke to men whom the\r\ntribute of vanquished cities supplied with food and clothing, with\r\nthe luxury of the bath and the amusements of the theatre, on whom the\r\ngreatness of their country conferred rank, and before whom the members\r\nof less prosperous communities trembled; to men who, in case of a change\r\nin the public fortunes, would, at least, be deprived of every comfort\r\nand every distinction which they enjoyed. To be butchered on the smoking\r\nruins of their city, to be dragged in chains to a slave-market, to see\r\none child torn from them to dig in the quarries of Sicily, and another\r\nto guard the harems of Per-sepolis, these were the frequent and probable\r\nconsequences of national calamities. Hence, among the Greeks, patriotism\r\nbecame a governing principle, or rather an ungovernable passion.\r\nTheir legislators and their philosophers took it for granted that, in\r\nproviding for the strength and greatness of the state, they sufficiently\r\nprovided for the happiness of the people. The writers of the Roman\r\nempire lived under despots, into whose dominion a hundred nations\r\nwere melted down, and whose gardens would have covered the little\r\ncommonwealths of Plilius and Platæa. Yet they continued to employ the\r\nsame language, and to cant about the duty of sacrificing every thing to\r\na country to which they owed nothing. {313}Causes similar to those which\r\nhad influenced the disposition of the Greeks operated powerfully on the\r\nless vigorous and daring character of the Italians. The Italians, like\r\nthe Greeks, were members of small communities. Every man was deeply\r\ninterested in the welfare of the society to which he belonged, a\r\npartaker in its wealth and its poverty, in its glory and its shame. In\r\nthe age of Machiavelli this was peculiarly the case. Public events had\r\nproduced an immense sum of misery to private citizens. The Northern\r\ninvaders had brought want to their boards, infamy to their beds, fire to\r\ntheir roofs, and the knife to their throats. It was natural that a man\r\nwho lived in times like these should overrate the importance of those\r\nmeasures by which a nation is rendered formidable to its neighbours, and\r\nundervalue those which make it prosperous within itself.\r\n\r\nNothing is more remarkable in the political treatises of Machiavelli\r\nthan the fairness of mind which they indicate. It appears where the\r\nauthor is in the wrong, almost as strongly as where he is in the right.\r\nHe never advances a false opinion because it is new or splendid,\r\nbecause he can clothe it in a happy phrase, or defend it by an ingenious\r\nsophism. His errors are at once explained by a reference to the\r\ncircumstances in which he was placed. They evidently were not sought\r\nout; they lay in his way, and could scarcely be avoided. Such mistakes\r\nmust necessarily be committed by early speculators in every science.\r\n\r\nIn this respect it is amusing to compare The Prince and the Discourses\r\nwith the Spirit of Laws. Montesquieu enjoys, perhaps, a wider celebrity\r\nthan any political writer of modern Europe. Something he doubtless owes\r\nto his merit, but much more to his fortune. {314}He had the good luck of\r\na Valentine. He caught the eye of the French nation, at the moment when\r\nit was waking from the long sleep of political and religious bigotry;\r\nand, in consequence, he became a favourite. The English, at that time,\r\nconsidered a Frenchman who talked about constitutional checks and\r\nfundamental laws as a prodigy not less astonishing than the learned\r\npig or the musical infant. Specious but shallow, studious of effect,\r\nindifferent to truth, eager to build a system, but careless of\r\ncollecting those materials out of which alone a sound and durable system\r\ncan be built, the lively President constructed theories as rapidly\r\nand as slightly as card-houses, no sooner projected than completed, no\r\nsooner completed than blown away, no sooner blown away than forgotten.\r\nMachiavelli errs only because his experience, acquired in a very\r\npeculiar state of society, could not always enable him to calculate the\r\neffect of institutions differing from those of which he had observed the\r\noperation. Montesquieu errs, because he has a fine thing to say, and is\r\nresolved to say it. If the phænomena which lie before him will not suit\r\nhis purpose, all history must be ransacked. If nothing established by\r\nauthentic testimony can be racked or chipped to suit his Procrustean\r\nhypothesis, he puts up with some monstrous fable about Siam, or Bantam,\r\nor Japan, told by writers compared with whom Lucian and Gulliver were\r\nveracious, liars by a double right, as travellers and as Jesuits.\r\n\r\nPropriety of thought, and propriety of diction, are commonly found\r\ntogether. Obscurity and affectation are the two greatest faults of\r\nstyle. Obscurity of expression generally springs from confusion\r\nof ideas; and the same wish to dazzle at any cost which produces\r\naffectation in the manner of a writer, is likely to produce\r\n{315}sophistry in his reasonings. The judicious and candid mind of\r\nMachiavelli shows itself in his luminous, manly, and polished language.\r\nThe style of Montesquieu, on the other hand, indicates in every page a\r\nlively and ingenious, but an unsound mind. Every trick of expression,\r\nfrom the mysterious conciseness of an oracle to the flippancy of a\r\nParisian coxcomb, is employed to disguise the fallacy of some positions,\r\nand the triteness of others. Absurdities are brightened into epigrams;\r\ntruisms are darkened into enigmas. It is with difficulty that\r\nthe strongest eye can sustain the glare with which some parts are\r\nilluminated, or penetrate the shade in which others are concealed.\r\n\r\nThe political works of Machiavelli derive a peculiar interest from the\r\nmournful earnestness which he manifests whenever he touches on topics\r\nconnected with the calamities of his native land. It is difficult to\r\nconceive any situation more painful than that of a great man, condemned\r\nto watch the lingering agony of an exhausted country, to tend it\r\nduring the alternate fits of stupefaction and raving which precede its\r\ndissolution, and to see the symptoms of vitality disappear one by one,\r\ntill nothing is left but coldness, darkness, and corruption. To this\r\njoyless and thankless duty was Machiavelli called. In the energetic\r\nlanguage of the prophet, he was “mad for the sight of his eyes which\r\nhe saw,” disunion in the council, effeminacy in the camp, liberty\r\nextinguished, commerce decaying, national honour sullied, an enlightened\r\nand flourishing people given over to the ferocity of ignorant savages.\r\nThough his opinions had not escaped the contagion of that political\r\nimmorality which was common among his: countrymen, his natural\r\ndisposition seems to have been {316}rather stern and impetuous than\r\npliant and artful. When the misery and degradation of Florence and the\r\nfoul outrage which he had himself sustained recur to his mind the smooth\r\ncraft of his profession and his nation is exchanged for the honest\r\nbitterness of scorn and anger. He speaks like one sick of the calamitous\r\ntimes and abject people among whom his lot is cast. He pines for the\r\nstrength and glory of ancient Rome, for the fasces of Brutus and the\r\nsword of Scipio, the gravity of the curule chair, and the bloody pomp\r\nof the triumphal sacrifice. He seems to be transported back to the days\r\nwhen eight hundred thousand Italian warriors sprung to arms at the rumor\r\nof a Gallic invasion. He breathes all the spirit of those intrepid and\r\nhaughty senators who forgot the dearest ties of nature in the claims of\r\npublic duty, who looked with disdain on the elephants and on the gold of\r\nPyrrhus, and listened with unaltered composure to the tremendous tidings\r\nof Cannae. Like an ancient temple deformed by the barbarous architecture\r\nof a later age, his character acquires an interest from the very\r\ncircumstances which debase it. The original proportions are rendered\r\nmore striking by the contrast which they present to the mean and\r\nincongruous additions.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the sentiments which we have described was not apparent\r\nin his writings alone. His enthusiasm, barred from the career which it\r\nwould have selected for itself, seems to have found a vent in desperate\r\nlevity. He enjoyed a vindictive pleasure in outraging the opinions of\r\na society which he despised. He became careless of the decencies which\r\nwere expected from a man so highly distinguished in the literary and\r\npolitical world. The sarcastic bitterness {317}of his conversation\r\ndisgusted those who were more inclined to accuse his licentiousness than\r\ntheir own degeneracy, and who were unable to conceive the strength of\r\nthose emotions which are concealed by the jests of the wretched, and by\r\nthe follies of the wise.\r\n\r\nThe historical works of Machiavelli still remain to be considered. The\r\nlife of Castruccio Castracani will occupy us for a very short time, and\r\nwould scarcely have demanded our notice, had it not attracted a much\r\ngreater share of public attention than it deserves. Few books, indeed,\r\ncould be more interesting than a careful and judicious account, from\r\nsuch a pen, of the illustrious Prince of Lucca, the most eminent of\r\nthose Italian chiefs, who like Pisistratus and Gelon, acquired a power\r\nfelt rather than seen, and resting, not on law or on prescription, but\r\non the public favour and on their great personal qualities. Such a work\r\nwould exhibit to us the real nature of that species of sovereignty,\r\nso singular and so often misunderstood, which the Greeks denominated\r\ntyranny, and which, modified in some degree by the feudal system,\r\nreappeared in the commonwealths of Lombardy and Tuscany. But this\r\nlittle composition of Machiavelli is in no sense a history. It has\r\nno pretensions to fidelity. It is a trifle, and not a very successful\r\ntrifle. It is scarcely more authentic than the novel of Belphegor, and\r\nis very much duller.\r\n\r\nThe last great work of this illustrious man was the history of his\r\nnative city. It was written by command of the Pope, who, as chief of the\r\nhouse of Medici, was at that time sovereign of Florence. The characters\r\nof Cosmo, of Piero, and of Lorenzo, are, however, treated with a freedom\r\nand impartiality equally honourable {318}to the writer and to the\r\npatron. The miseries and humiliations of dependence, the bread which\r\nis more bitter than every other food, the stairs which are more painful\r\nthan every other ascent, had not broken the spirit of Machiavelli. The\r\nmost corrupting post in a corrupting profession had not depraved the\r\ngenerous heart of Clement.\r\n\r\nThe History does not appear to be the fruit of much industry or\r\nresearch. It is unquestionably inaccurate. But it is elegant, lively,\r\nand picturesque, beyond any other in the Italian language. The reader,\r\nwe believe, carries away from it a more vivid and a more faithful\r\nimpression of the national character and manners than from more correct\r\naccounts. The truth is, that the book belongs rather to ancient than to\r\nmodern literature. It is in the style, not of Davila and Clarendon, but\r\nof Herodotus and Tacitus. The classical histories may almost be\r\ncalled romances founded in fact. The relation is, no doubt, in all its\r\nprincipal points, strictly true. But the numerous little incidents which\r\nheighten the interest, the words, the gestures, the looks, are evidently\r\nfurnished by the imagination of the author. The fashion of later times\r\nis different. A more exact narrative is given by the writer. It may be\r\ndoubted whether more exact notions are conveyed to the reader. The\r\nbest portraits are perhaps those in which there is a slight mixture\r\nof caricature, and we are not certain, that the best histories are not\r\nthose in which a little of the exaggeration of fictitious narrative is\r\njudiciously employed. Something is lost in accuracy; but much is gained\r\nin effect. The fainter lines are neglected; but the great characteristic\r\nfeatures are imprinted on the mind for ever.\r\n\r\nThe History terminates with the death of Lorenzo de’ Medici.\r\n{319}Machiavelli had, it seems, intended to continue his narrative to a\r\nlater period. But his death prevented the execution of his design;\r\nand the melancholy task of recording the desolation and shame of Italy\r\ndevolved on Guicciardini.\r\n\r\nMachiavelli lived long enough to see the commencement of the last\r\nstruggle for Florentine liberty. Soon after his death monarchy was\r\nfinally established, not such a monarchy as that of which Cosmo had laid\r\nthe foundations deep in the institutions and feelings of his countrymen,\r\nand which Lorenzo had embellished with the trophies of every science and\r\nevery art; but a loathsome tyranny, proud and mean, cruel and feeble,\r\nbigotted and lascivious. The character of Machiavelli was hateful to\r\nthe new masters of Italy; and those parts of his theory which were in\r\nstrict accordance with their own daily practice afforded a pretext for\r\nblackening his memory. His works were misrepresented by the learned,\r\nmisconstrued by the ignorant, censured by the church, abused with all\r\nthe rancour of simulated virtue, by the tools of a base government, and\r\nthe priests of a baser superstition. The name of the man whose genius\r\nhad illuminated all the dark places of policy, and to whose patriotic\r\nwisdom an oppressed people had owed their last chance of emancipation\r\nand revenge, passed into a proverb of infamy. For more than two hundred\r\nyears his bones lay undistinguished. At length, an English nobleman paid\r\nthe last honours to the greatest statesman of Florence. In the church of\r\nSanta Croce a monument was erected to his memory, which is contemplated\r\nwith reverence by all who can distinguish the virtues of a great\r\nmind through the corruptions of a degenerate age, and which will be\r\napproached with still deeper homage when the object to {320}which his\r\npublic life was devoted shall be attained, when the foreign yoke shall\r\nbe broken, when a second Procida shall avenge the wrongs of Naples, when\r\na happier Rienzi shall restore the good estate of Rome, when the streets\r\nof Florence and Bologna shall again resound with their ancient war-cry,\r\n_Popolo; popolo; muoano i tiranni!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN DRYDEN. (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n{321}(_Edinburgh Review_, January 1828.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public voice has assigned to Dryden the first place in the\r\nsecond rank of our poets,--no mean station in a table of intellectual\r\nprecedency so rich in illustrious names. It is allowed that, even of\r\nthe few who were his superiors in genius, none has exercised a more\r\nextensive or permanent influence on the national habits of thought and\r\nexpression. His life was commensurate with the period during which\r\na great revolution in the public taste was effected; and in that\r\nrevolution he played the part of Cromwell. By unscrupulously taking the\r\nlead in its wildest excesses, he obtained the absolute guidance of it.\r\nBy trampling on laws, he acquired the authority of a legislator. By\r\nsignalising himself as the most daring and irreverent of rebels, he\r\nraised himself to the dignity of a recognised prince. He commenced his\r\ncareer by the most frantic outrages. He terminated it in the repose of\r\nestablished sovereignty,--the author of a new code, the root of a new\r\ndynasty.\r\n\r\nOf Dryden, however, as of almost every man who has been distinguished\r\neither in the literary or in the political world, it may be said that\r\nthe course which he\r\n\r\n     (1) _The Poetical Works of_ John Dryden. In 2 volumes.\r\n     University Edition. London, 1826.\r\n\r\n{322}pursued, and the effect which he produced, depended less on his\r\npersonal qualities than on the circumstances in which he was placed.\r\nThose who have read history with discrimination know the fallacy of\r\nthose panegyrics and invectives which represent individuals as effecting\r\ngreat moral and intellectual revolutions, subverting established\r\nsystems, and imprinting a new character on their age. The difference\r\nbetween one man and another is by no means so great as the superstitious\r\ncrowd supposes. But the same feelings which in ancient Rome produced the\r\napotheosis of a popular emperor, and in modern Rome the canonisation of\r\na devout prelate, led men to cherish an illusion which furnishes them\r\nwith something to adore. By a law of association, from the operation of\r\nwhich even minds the most strictly regulated by reason are not wholly\r\nexempt, misery disposes us to hatred, and happiness to love, although\r\nthere may be no person to whom our misery or our happiness can be\r\nascribed. The peevishness of an invalid vents itself even on those who\r\nalleviate his pain. The good humour of a man elated by success often\r\ndisplays itself towards enemies. In the same manner, the feelings of\r\npleasure and admiration, to which the contemplation of great events\r\ngives birth, make an object where they do not find it. Thus, nations\r\ndescend to the absurdities of Egyptian idolatry, and worship stocks and\r\nreptiles--Sacheverells and Wilkeses. They even fall prostrate before a\r\ndeity to which they have themselves given the form which commands their\r\nveneration, and which, unless fashioned by them, would have remained a\r\nshapeless block. They persuade themselves that they are the creatures of\r\nwhat they have themselves created. For, in fact, it is the age that\r\nforms the man, not the man that {323}forms the age. Great minds do\r\nindeed only pay with interest what they have received. We extol Bacon\r\nand sneer at Aquinas. But, if their situations had been changed, Bacon\r\nmight have been the Angelical Doctor, the most subtle Aristotelian of\r\nthe schools; the Dominican might have led forth the sciences from their\r\nhouse of bondage. If Luther had been born in the tenth century, he would\r\nhave effected no reformation. If he had never been born at all, it is\r\nevident that the sixteenth century could not have elapsed without a\r\ngreat schism in the church. Voltaire, in the days of Louis the\r\nFourteenth, would probably have been, like most of the literary men of\r\nthat time, a zealous Jansenist, eminent among the defenders of\r\nefficacious grace, a bitter assailant of the lax morality of the Jesuits\r\nand the unreasonable decisions of the Sorbonne. If Pascal had entered on\r\nhis literary career when intelligence was more general, and abuses at\r\nthe same time more flagrant, when the church was polluted by the\r\nIscariot Dubois, the court disgraced by the orgies of Canillac, and the\r\nnation sacrificed to the juggles of Law, if he had lived to see a\r\ndynasty of harlots, an empty treasury and a crowded harem, an army\r\nformidable only to those whom it should have protected, a priesthood\r\njust religious enough to be intolerant, he might possibly, like every\r\nman of genius in France, have imbibed extravagant prejudices against\r\nmonarchy and Christianity. The wit which blasted the sophisms of\r\nEscobar--the impassioned eloquence which defended the sisters of Port\r\nRoyal--the intellectual hardihood which was not beaten down even by\r\nPapal authority--might have raised him to the Patriarchate of the\r\nPhilosophical {324}Church. It was long disputed whether the honour of\r\ninventing the method of Fluxions belonged to Newton or to Leibnitz. It\r\nis now generally allowed that these great men made the same discovery at\r\nthe same time. Mathematical science, indeed, had then reached such a\r\npoint that, if neither of them had ever existed, the principle must\r\ninevitably have occurred to some person within a few years. So in our\r\nown time the doctrine of rent, now universally received by political\r\neconomists, was propounded, almost at the same moment, by two writers\r\nunconnected with each other. Preceding speculators had long been\r\nblundering round about it; and it could not possibly have been missed\r\nmuch longer by the most heedless inquirer. We are inclined to think\r\nthat, with respect to every great addition which has been made to the\r\nstock of human knowledge, the case has been similar; that without\r\nCopernicus we should have been Copernicans,--that without Columbus\r\nAmerica would have been discovered,--that without Locke we should have\r\npossessed a just theory of the origin of human ideas. Society indeed has\r\nits great men and its little men, as the earth has its mountains and its\r\nvalleys. But the inequalities of intellect, like the inequalities of the\r\nsurface of our globe, bear so small a proportion to the mass, that, in\r\ncalculating its great revolutions, they may safely be neglected. The sun\r\nilluminates the hills, while it is still below the horizon; and truth is\r\ndiscovered by the highest minds a little before it becomes manifest to\r\nthe multitude. This is the extent of their superiority. They are the\r\nfirst to catch and reflect a light, which, without their assistance,\r\nmust, in a short time, be visible to those who lie far beneath them.\r\n{325}The same remark will apply equally to the fine arts. The laws on\r\nwhich depend the progress and decline of poetry, painting, and\r\nsculpture, operate with little less certainty than those which regulate\r\nthe periodical returns of heat and cold, of fertility and barrenness.\r\nThose who seem to lead the public taste are, in general, merely\r\noutrunning it in the direction which it is spontaneously pursuing.\r\nWithout a just apprehension of the laws to which we have alluded, the\r\nmerits and defects of Dryden can be but imperfectly understood. We will,\r\ntherefore, state what we conceive them to be.\r\n\r\nThe ages in which the master-pieces of imagination have been produced\r\nhave by no means been those in which taste has been most correct. It\r\nseems that the creative faculty, and the critical faculty, cannot exist\r\ntogether in their highest perfection. The causes of this phenomenon it\r\nis not difficult to assign.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the man who is best able to take a machine to pieces,\r\nand who most clearly comprehends the manner in which all its wheels and\r\nsprings conduce to its general effect, will be the man most competent to\r\nform another machine of similar power. In all the branches of physical\r\nand moral science which admit of perfect analysis, he who can resolve\r\nwill be able to combine. But the analysis which criticism can effect\r\nof poetry is necessarily imperfect. One element must for ever elude its\r\nresearches; and that is the very element by which poetry is poetry. In\r\nthe description of nature, for example, a judicious reader will easily\r\ndetect an incongruous image. But he will find it impossible to explain\r\nin what consists the art of a writer who, in a few words, brings some\r\nspot before him so vividly that he shall know it as if he had lived\r\nthere from childhood; while another, employing the {326}same materials,\r\nthe same verdure, the same water, and the same flowers, committing\r\nno inaccuracy, introducing nothing which can be positively pronounced\r\nsuperfluous, omitting nothing which can be positively pronounced\r\nnecessary, shall produce no more effect than an advertisement of a\r\ncapital residence and a desirable pleasure-ground. To take another\r\nexample: the great features of the character of Hotspur are obvious to\r\nthe most superficial reader. We at once perceive that his courage is\r\nsplendid, his thirst of glory intense, his animal spirits high, his\r\ntemper careless, arbitrary, and petulant; that he indulges his own\r\nhumour without caring whose feelings he may wound, or whose enmity he\r\nmay provoke, by his levity. Thus far criticism will go. But something\r\nis still wanting. A man might have all those qualities, and every other\r\nquality which the most minute examiner can introduce into his catalogue\r\nof the virtues and faults of Hotspur, and yet he would not be Hotspur.\r\nAlmost everything that we have said of him applies equally to Falcon\r\nbridge. Yet in the mouth of Falconbridge most of his speeches would seem\r\nout of place. In real life this perpetually occurs. We are sensible of\r\nnude differences between men whom, if we were required to describe them,\r\nwe should describe in almost the same terms. If we were attempting to\r\ndraw elaborate characters of them, we should scarcely be able to\r\npoint out any strong distinction; yet we approach them with feelings\r\naltogether dissimilar. We cannot conceive of them as using the\r\nexpressions or the gestures of each other. Let us suppose that a\r\nzoologist should attempt to give an account of some animal, a porcupine\r\nfor instance, to people who had never seen it. The porcupine, he might\r\nsay, is of the genus mammalia, and the order {327}glires. There are\r\nwhiskers on its face; it is two feet long; it has four toes before, five\r\nbehind, two fore teeth, and eight grinders. Its body is covered with\r\nhair and quills. And, when all this had been said, would any one of the\r\nauditors have formed a just idea of a porcupine? Would any two of\r\nthem have formed the same idea? There might exist innumerable races of\r\nanimals, possessing all the characteristics which have been mentioned,\r\nyet altogether unlike to each other. What the description of our\r\nnaturalist is to a real porcupine, the remarks of criticism are to the\r\nimages of poetry. What it so imperfectly decomposes it cannot perfectly\r\nre-construct. It is evidently as impossible to produce an Othello or a\r\nMacbeth by reversing an analytical process so defective, as it would\r\nbe for an anatomist to form a living man out of the fragments of his\r\ndissecting-room. In both cases the vital principle eludes the finest\r\ninstruments, and vanishes in the very instant in which its seat is\r\ntouched. Hence those who, trusting to their critical skill, attempt to\r\nwrite poems give us, not images of things, but catalogues of qualities.\r\nTheir characters are allegories; not good men and bad men, but cardinal\r\nvirtues and deadly sins. We seem to have fallen among the acquaintances\r\nof our old friend Christian: sometimes we meet Mistrust and Timorous;\r\nsometimes Mr. Hate-good and Mr. Love-lust; and then again Prudence,\r\nPiety, and Charity.\r\n\r\nThat critical discernment is not sufficient to make men poets, is\r\ngenerally allowed. Why it should keep them from becoming poets, is not\r\nperhaps equally evident: but the fact is, that poetry requires not an\r\nexamining but a believing frame of mind. Those feel it most, and\r\nwrite it best, who forget that it is a work {328}of art; to whom its\r\nimitations, like the realities from which they are taken, are subjects,\r\nnot for connoisseur-ship, but for tears and laughter, resentment and\r\naffection; who are too much under the influence of the illusion to\r\nadmire the genius which has produced it; who are too much frightened for\r\nUlysses in the cave of Polyphemus to care whether the pun about Outis be\r\ngood or bad; who forget that such a person as Shakspeare ever existed,\r\nwhile they weep and curse with Lear. It is by giving faith to the\r\ncreations of the imagination that a man becomes a poet. It is by\r\ntreating those creations as deceptions, and by resolving them, as nearly\r\nas possible, into their elements, that he becomes a critic. In the\r\nmoment in which the skill of the artist is perceived, the spell of the\r\nart is broken.\r\n\r\nThese considerations account for the absurdities into which the greatest\r\nwriters have fallen, when they have attempted to give general rules for\r\ncomposition, or to pronounce judgment on the works of others. They are\r\nunaccustomed to analyse what they feel; they, therefore, perpetually\r\nrefer their emotions to causes which have not in the slightest degree\r\ntended to produce them. They feel pleasure in reading a book. They\r\nnever consider that this pleasure may be the effect of ideas which\r\nsome unmeaning expression, striking on the first link of a chain of\r\nassociations, may have called up in their own minds--that they have\r\nthemselves furnished to the author the beauties which they admire.\r\n\r\nCervantes is the delight of all classes of readers. Every school-boy\r\nthumbs to pieces the most wretched translations of his romance, and\r\nknows the lantern jaws of the Knight Errant, and the broad cheeks of\r\nthe Squire, as well as the faces of his own playfellow’s. {329}The most\r\nexperienced and fastidious judges are amazed at the perfection of that\r\nart which extracts inextinguishable laughter from the greatest of human\r\ncalamities without once violating the reverence due to it; at that\r\ndiscriminating delicacy of touch which makes a character exquisitely\r\nridiculous, without impairing its worth, its grace, or its dignity. In\r\nDon Quixote are several dissertations on the principles of poetic and\r\ndramatic writing. No passages in the whole work exhibit stronger marks\r\nof labour and attention; and no passages in any work with which we\r\nare acquainted are more worthless and puerile. In our time they would\r\nscarcely obtain admittance into the literary department of the Morning\r\nPost. Every reader of the Divine Comedy must be struck by the veneration\r\nwhich Dante expresses for writers far inferior to himself. He will not\r\nlift up his eyes from the ground in the presence of Brunetto, all whose\r\nworks are not worth the worst of his own hundred cantos. He does\r\nnot venture to walk in the same line with the bombastic Statius. His\r\nadmiration of Virgil is absolute idolatry. If indeed it had been excited\r\nby the elegant, splendid, and harmonious diction of the Roman poet,\r\nit would not have been altogether unreasonable; but it is rather as an\r\nauthority on all points of philosophy, than as a work of imagination,\r\nthat he values the Æneid. The most trivial passages he regards as\r\noracles of the highest authority, and of the most recondite meaning. He\r\ndescribes his conductor as the sea of all wisdom--the sun which heals\r\nevery disordered sight. As he judged of Virgil, the Italians of the\r\nfourteenth century judged of him; they were proud of him; they praised\r\nhim; they struck medals bearing his head; they quarrelled {330}for the\r\nhonour of possessing his remains; they maintained professors to expound\r\nhis writings. But what they admired was not that mighty imagination\r\nwhich called a new world into existence, and made all its sights and\r\nsounds familiar to the eye and ear of the mind. They said little of\r\nthose awful and lovely creations on which later critics delight to\r\ndwell--Farinata lifting his haughty and tranquil brow from his couch of\r\neverlasting fire--the lion-like repose of Sordello--or the light which\r\nshone from the celestial smile of Beatrice. They extolled their great\r\npoet for his smattering of ancient literature and history; for his\r\nlogic and his divinity; for his absurd physics, and his more absurd\r\nmetaphysics; for everything but that in which he preeminently excelled.\r\nLike the fool in the story, who ruined his dwelling by digging for gold,\r\nwhich, as he had dreamed, was concealed under its foundations, they laid\r\nwaste one of the noblest works of human genius, by seeking in it\r\nfor buried treasures of wisdom which existed only in their own wild\r\nreveries. The finest passages were little valued till they had been\r\ndebased into some monstrous allegory. Louder applause was given to\r\nthe lecture on fate and free-will, or to the ridiculous astronomical\r\ntheories, than to those tremendous lines which disclose the secrets\r\nof the tower of hunger, or to that half-told tale of guilty love, so\r\npassionate and so full of tears.\r\n\r\nWe do not mean to say that the contemporaries of Dante read with less\r\nemotion than their descendants of Ugolino groping among the wasted\r\ncorpses of his children, or of Francesca starting at the tremulous kiss\r\nand dropping the fatal volume. Far from it. We believe that they admired\r\nthese things less than ourselves, but that they felt them more. We\r\nshould perhaps {331}say that they felt them too much to admire them. The\r\nprogress of a nation from barbarism to civilisation produces a change\r\nsimilar to that which takes place during the progress of an individual\r\nfrom infancy to mature age. What man does not remember with regret the\r\nfirst time that he read Robinson Crusoe? Then, indeed, he was unable\r\nto appreciate the powers of the writer; or, rather, he neither knew nor\r\ncared whether the book had a writer at all. He probably thought it not\r\nhalf so fine as some rant of Macpherson about dark-browed Foldath, and\r\nwhite-bosomed Strinadona.\r\n\r\nHe now values Fingal and Temora only as showing with how little evidence\r\na story may be believed, and with how little merit a book may be\r\npopular. Of the romance of Defoe he entertains the highest opinion. He\r\nperceives the hand of a master in ten thousand touches which formerly he\r\npassed by without notice. But, though he understands the merits of the\r\nnarrative better than formerly, he is far less interested by it. Xury\r\nand Friday, and pretty Poll, the boat with the shoulder-of-mutton sail,\r\nand the canoe which could not be brought down to the water edge, the\r\ntent with its hedge and ladders, the preserve of kids, and the den where\r\nthe old goat died, can never again be to him the realities which\r\nthey were. The days when his favourite volume set him upon making\r\nwheel-barrows and chairs, upon digging caves and fencing huts in the\r\ngarden, can never return. Such is the law of our nature. Our judgment\r\nripens; our imagination decays. We cannot at once enjoy the flowers of\r\nthe spring of life and the fruits of its autumn, the pleasures of close\r\ninvestigation and those of agreeable error. We cannot sit at once in\r\nthe front of the stage and behind the scenes. We cannot be under the\r\nillusion of the {332}spectacle, while we are watching the movements of\r\nthe ropes and pulleys which dispose it.\r\n\r\nThe chapter in which Fielding describes the behaviour of Partridge at\r\nthe theatre affords so complete an illustration of our proposition, that\r\nwe cannot refrain from quoting some parts of it.\r\n\r\n“Partridge gave that credit to Mr. Garrick which he had denied to Jones,\r\nand fell into so violent a trembling that his knees knocked against each\r\nother. Jones asked him what was the matter, and whether he was afraid of\r\nthe warrior npon the stage?--‘O, la, sir,’ said he, ‘I perceive now it\r\nis what you told me. I am not afraid of anything, for I know it is but\r\na play; and if it was really a ghost, it could do one no harm at such a\r\ndistance and in so much company; and yet, if I was frightened, I am not\r\nthe only person.’--‘Why, who,’ cries Jones, ‘dost thou take to be such\r\na coward here besides thyself?’--‘Nay, you may call me a coward if you\r\nwill; but if that little man there npon the stage is not frightened, I\r\nnever saw any man frightened in my life.’.... He sat with his eyes fixed\r\npartly on the ghost and partly on Hamlet, and with his mouth open; the\r\nsame passions which succeeded each other in Hamlet, succeeding likewise\r\nin him.......\r\n\r\n“Little more worth remembering occurred during the play, at the end of\r\nwhich Jones asked him which of the players he liked best. To this he\r\nanswered, with some appearance of indignation at the question, ‘The\r\nKing, without doubt.’--‘Indeed, Mr. Partridge,’ says Mrs. Miller, ‘you\r\nare not of the same opinion with the town; for they are all agreed that\r\nHamlet is acted by the best player who was ever on the stage.’ ‘He the\r\nbest player!’ cries Partridge, with a contemptuous sneer; ‘why I could\r\nact as well as he myself. I am sure, if I had seen a ghost, I should\r\nhave looked in the very same manner, and done just as he did. And then,\r\nto be sure, in that scene, as you called it, between him and his mother,\r\nwhere you told me he acted so fine, why, any man, that is, any good man,\r\nthat had such a mother, would have done exactly the same. I know you are\r\nonly joking with me; but indeed, madam, though I never was at a play in\r\nLondon, yet I have seen acting before in the country, and the King, for\r\nmy money, he speaks all his words distinctly, and half as loud again\r\nas the other. Anybody may see he is an actor.’” {333}In this excellent\r\npassage Partridge is represented as a very bad theatrical critic. But\r\nnone of those who laugh at him possess the tithe of his sensibility to\r\ntheatrical excellence. He admires in the wrong place; but he trembles\r\nin the right place. It is indeed because he is so much excited by the\r\nacting of Garrick, that he ranks him below the strutting, mouthing\r\nperformer, who personates the King. So, we have heard it said that,\r\nin some parts of Spain and Portugal, an actor who should represent a\r\ndepraved character finely, instead of calling down the applauses of the\r\naudience, is hissed and pelted without mercy. It would be the same\r\nin England, if we, for one moment, thought that Shylock or Iago was\r\nstanding before us. While the dramatic art was in its infancy at Athens,\r\nit produced similar effects on the ardent and imaginative spectators.\r\nIt is said that they blamed Æschylus for frightening them into fits\r\nwith his Furies. Herodotus tells us that, when Phrynichus produced\r\nhis tragedy on the fall of Miletus, they fined him in a penalty of\r\na thousand drachmas for torturing their feelings by so pathetic an\r\nexhibition. They did not regard him as a great artist, but merely as\r\na man who had given them pain. When they woke from the distressing\r\nillusion, they treated the author of it as they would have treated a\r\nmessenger who should have brought them fatal and alarming tidings which\r\nturned out to be false. In the same manner, a child screams with terror\r\nat the sight of a person in an ugly mask. He has perhaps seen the\r\nmask put on. But his imagination is too strong for his reason; and he\r\nintreats that it may be taken off.\r\n\r\nWe should act in the same manner if the grief and horror produced in us\r\nby works of the imagination amounted to real torture. But in us these\r\nemotions are {334}comparatively languid. They rarely affect our appetite\r\nor our sleep. They leave us sufficiently at ease to trace them to their\r\ncauses, and to estimate the powers which produce them. Our attention is\r\nspeedily diverted from the images which call forth our tears to the art\r\nby which those images have been selected and combined. We applaud the\r\ngenius of the writer. We applaud our own sagacity and sensibility; and\r\nwe are comforted.\r\n\r\nYet, though, we think that in the progress of nations towards refinement\r\nthe reasoning powers are improved at the expense of the imagination, we\r\nacknowledge that to this rule there are many apparent exceptions. We\r\nare not, however, quite satisfied that they are more than apparent. Men\r\nreasoned better, for example, in the time of Elizabeth than in the time\r\nof Egbert; and they also wrote better poetry. But we must distinguish\r\nbetween poetry as a mental act, and poetry as a species of composition.\r\nIf we take it in the latter sense, its excellence depends, not solely on\r\nthe vigour of the imagination, but partly also on the instruments which\r\nthe imagination employs. Within certain limits, therefore, poetry may he\r\nimproving while the poetical faculty is decaying. The vividness of the\r\npicture presented to the reader is not necessarily proportioned to the\r\nvividness of the prototype which exists in the mind of the writer. In\r\nthe other arts we see this clearly. Should a man, gifted by nature with\r\nall the genius of Canova, attempt to carve a statue without instruction\r\nas to the management of his chisel, or attention to the anatomy of\r\nthe human body, he would produce something compared with which the\r\nHighlander at the door of a snuff shop would deserve admiration. If an\r\nuninitiated Raphael were to attempt {335}a painting, it would be a mere\r\ndaub; indeed, the connoisseurs say that the early works of Raphael are\r\nlittle better. Yet, who can attribute this to want of imagination? Who\r\ncan doubt that the youth of that great artist was passed amidst an\r\nideal world of beautiful and majestic forms? Or, who will attribute\r\nthe difference which appears between his first rude essays and his\r\nmagnificent Transfiguration to a change in the constitution of his\r\nmind? In poetry, as in painting and sculpture, it is necessary that\r\nthe imitator should be well acquainted with that which he undertakes to\r\nimitate, and expert in the mechanical part of his art. Genius will not\r\nfurnish him with a vocabulary: it will not teach him what word most\r\nexactly corresponds to his idea, and will most fully convey it to\r\nothers: it will not make him a great descriptive poet, till he has\r\nlooked with attention on the face of nature; or a great dramatist,\r\ntill he has felt and witnessed much of the influence of the passions.\r\nInformation and experience are, therefore, necessary; not for the\r\npurpose of strengthening the imagination, which is never so strong as in\r\npeople incapable of reasoning--savages, children, madmen, and\r\ndreamers; but for the purpose of enabling the artist to communicate his\r\nconceptions to others.\r\n\r\nIn a barbarous age the imagination exercises a despotic power. So strong\r\nis the perception of what is unreal that it often overpowers all the\r\npassions of the mind and all the sensations of the body. At first,\r\nindeed, the phantasm remains undivulged, a hidden treasure, a wordless\r\npoetry, an invisible painting, a silent music, a dream of which the\r\npains and pleasures exist to the dreamer alone, a bitterness which the\r\nheart only knoweth, a joy with which a stranger intermeddleth not. The\r\nmachinery, by which ideas are to be conveyed {336}from one person to\r\nanother, is as yet rude and defective. Between mind and mind there is\r\na great gulf. The imitative arts do not exist, or are in their lowest\r\nstate. But the actions of men amply prove that the faculty which gives\r\nbirth to those arts is morbidly active. It is not yet the inspiration of\r\npoets and sculptors; but it is the amusement of the day, the terror of\r\nthe night, the fertile source of wild superstitions. It turns the clouds\r\ninto gigantic shapes, and the winds into doleful voices. The belief\r\nwhich springs from it is more absolute and undoubting than any which can\r\nbe derived from evidence. It resembles the faith which we repose in our\r\nown sensations. Thus, the Arab, when covered with wounds, saw nothing\r\nbut the dark eyes and the green kerchief of a beckoning Houri. The\r\nNorthern warrior laughed in the pangs of death when he thought of the\r\nmead of Valhalla.\r\n\r\nThe first works of the imagination are, as we have said, poor and rude,\r\nnot from the want of genius, but from the want of materials. Phidias\r\ncould have done nothing with an old tree and a fish-bone, or Homer with\r\nthe language of New Holland.\r\n\r\nYet the effect of these early performances, imperfect as they must\r\nnecessarily be, is immense. All deficiencies are supplied by the\r\nsusceptibility of those to whom they are addressed. We all know what\r\npleasure a wooden doll, which may be bought for sixpence, will afford\r\nto a little girl. She will require no other company. She will nurse it,\r\ndress it, and talk to it all day. No grown-up man takes half so much\r\ndelight in one of the incomparable babies of Chantrey. In the same\r\nmanner, savages are more affected by the rude compositions of their\r\nbards than nations more advanced in civilisation by the greatest\r\nmaster-pieces of poetry. {337}In process of time, the instruments by\r\nwhich the imagination works are brought to perfection. Men have not more\r\nimagination than their rude ancestors. We strongly suspect that they\r\nhave much less. But they produce better works of imagination. Thus, up\r\nto a certain period, the diminution of the poetical powers is far more\r\nthan compensated by the improvement of all the appliances and means\r\nof which those powers stand in need. Then comes the short period of\r\nsplendid and consummate excellence. And then, from causes against\r\nwhich it is vain to struggle, poetry begins to decline. The progress\r\nof language, which was at first favourable, becomes fatal to it, and,\r\ninstead of compensating for the decay of the imagination, accelerates\r\nthat decay, and renders it more obvious. When the adventurer in the\r\nArabian tale anointed one of his eyes with the contents of the magical\r\nbox, all the riches of the earth, however widely dispersed, however\r\nsacredly concealed, became visible to him. But, when he tried the\r\nexperiment on both eyes, he was struck with blindness. What the\r\nenchanted elixir was to the sight of the body, language is to the sight\r\nof the imagination. At first it calls up a world of glorious illusions;\r\nbut, when it becomes too copious, it altogether destroys the visual\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAs the development of the mind proceeds, symbols, instead of being\r\nemployed to convey images, are substituted for them. Civilised men think\r\nas they trade, not in kind, but by means of a circulating medium. In\r\nthese circumstances, the sciences improve rapidly, and criticism among\r\nthe rest; but poetry, in the highest sense of the word, disappears. Then\r\ncomes the dotage of the fine arts, a second childhood, as feeble as the\r\nformer, and far more, hopeless. This is the age of {338}critical poetry,\r\nof poetry by courtesy, of poetry to which the memory, the judgment, and\r\nthe wit contribute far more than the imagination. We readily allow that\r\nmany works of this description are excellent: we will not contend with\r\nthose who think them more valuable than the great poems of an earlier\r\nperiod. We only maintain that they belong to a different species of\r\ncomposition, and are produced by a different faculty.\r\n\r\nIt is some consolation to reflect that this critical school of poetry\r\nimproves as the science of criticism improves; and that the science\r\nof criticism, like every other science, is constantly tending towards\r\nperfection. As experiments are multiplied, principles are better\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, in our own, for example, there has been an interval\r\nbetween the downfall of the creative school and the rise of the\r\ncritical, a period during which imagination has been in its decrepitude,\r\nand taste in its infancy. Such a revolutionary interregnum as this will\r\nbe deformed by every species of extravagance.\r\n\r\nThe first victory of good taste is over the bombast and conceits which\r\ndeform such times as these. But criticism is still in a very imperfect\r\nstate. What is accidental is for a long time confounded with what is\r\nessential. General theories are drawn from detached facts. How many\r\nhours the action of a play may be allowed to occupy,--how many similes\r\nan Epic Poet may introduce into his first book,--whether a piece, which\r\nis acknowledged to have a beginning and an end, may not be without a\r\nmiddle, and other questions as puerile as these, formerly occupied the\r\nattention of men of letters in France, and even in this country. Poets,\r\nin such circumstances as these, exhibit all the {339}narrowness and\r\nfeebleness of the criticism by which their manner has been fashioned.\r\nFrom outrageous absurdity they are preserved indeed by their timidity.\r\nBut they perpetually sacrifice nature and reason to arbitrary canons\r\nof taste. In their eagerness to avoid the _mala prohibita_ of a foolish\r\ncode, they are perpetually rushing on the _mala in se_. Their great\r\npredecessors, it is true, were as bad critics as themselves, or perhaps\r\nworse: but those predecessors, as we have attempted to show, were\r\ninspired by a faculty independent of criticism, and, therefore, wrote\r\nwell while they judged ill.\r\n\r\nIn time men begin to take more rational and comprehensive views of\r\nliterature. The analysis of poetry, which, as we have remarked, must at\r\nbest be imperfect, approaches nearer and nearer to exactness. The merits\r\nof the wonderful models of former times are justly appreciated. The\r\nfrigid productions of a later age are rated at no more than their proper\r\nvalue. Pleasing and ingenious imitations of the manner of the great\r\nmasters appear. Poetry has a partial revival, a Saint Martin’s Summer,\r\nwhich, after a period of dreariness and decay, agreeably reminds us\r\nof the splendour of its June. A second harvest is gathered in; though,\r\ngrowing on a spent soil, it has not the heart of the former. Thus, in\r\nthe present age, Monti has successfully imitated the style of Dante;\r\nand something of the Elizabethan inspiration has been caught by several\r\neminent countrymen of our own. But never will Italy produce another\r\nInferno, or England another Hamlet. We look on the beauties of the\r\nmodern imitations with feelings similar to those with which we see\r\nflowers disposed in vases, to ornament the drawing-rooms of a capital.\r\nWe doubtless regard {340}them with pleasure, with greater pleasure,\r\nperhaps, because, in the midst of a place ungenial to them, they\r\nremind us of the distant spots on which they flourish in spontaneous\r\nexuberance. But we miss the sap, the freshness and the bloom. Or, if\r\nwe may borrow another illustration from Queen Scheherezade, we would\r\ncompare the writers of this school to the jewellers who were employed to\r\ncomplete the unfinished window of the palace of Aladdin. Whatever skill\r\nor-cost could do was done. Palace and bazaar were ransacked for precious\r\nstones. Yet the artists, with all their dexterity, with all their\r\nassiduity, and with all their vast means, were unable to produce\r\nanything comparable to the wonders which a spirit of a higher order had\r\nwrought in a single night.\r\n\r\nThe history of every literature with which we are acquainted confirms,\r\nwe think, the principles which we have laid down. In Greece we see\r\nthe imaginative school of poetry gradually fading into the critical.\r\nÆschylus and Pindar were succeeded by Sophocles, Sophocles by Euripides,\r\nEuripides by the Alexandrian versifiers. Of these last, Theocritus\r\nalone has left compositions which deserve to be read. The splendour and\r\ngrotesque fairyland of the Old Comedy, rich with such gorgeous hues,\r\npeopled with such fantastic shapes, and vocal alternately with the\r\nsweetest peals of music and the loudest bursts of elvish laughter,\r\ndisappeared for ever. The master-pieces of the New Comedy are known\r\nto us by Latin translations of extraordinary merit. From these\r\ntranslations, and from the expressions of the ancient critics, it is\r\nclear that the original compositions were distinguished by grace and\r\nsweetness, that they sparkled with wit, and abounded with pleading\r\nsentiment; but that the creative power was {341}gone. Julius Cæsar\r\ncalled Terence a half Menander,--a sure proof that Menander was not a\r\nquarter Aristophanes.\r\n\r\nThe literature of the Romans was merely a continuation of the literature\r\nof the Greeks. The pupils started from the point at which their masters\r\nhad, in the course of many generations, arrived. They thus almost wholly\r\nmissed the period of original invention. The only Latin poets whose\r\nwritings exhibit much vigour of imagination are Lucretius and Catullus.\r\nThe Augustan age produced nothing equal to their finer passages.\r\n\r\nIn France, that licensed jester, whose jingling cap and motley coat\r\nconcealed more genius than ever mustered in the saloon of Ninon or of\r\nMadame Géoffrin, was succeeded by writers as decorous and as tiresome as\r\ngentlemen-ushers.\r\n\r\nThe poetry of Italy and of Spain has undergone the same change. But\r\nnowhere has the revolution been more complete and violent than in\r\nEngland. The same person, who, when a boy, had clapped his thrilling\r\nhands at the first representation of the Tempest might, without\r\nattaining to a marvellous longevity, have lived to read the earlier\r\nworks of Prior and Addison. The change, we believe, must, sooner or\r\nlater, have taken place. But its progress was accelerated, and its\r\ncharacter modified, by the political occurrences of the times, and\r\nparticularly by two events, the closing of the theatres under the\r\ncommonwealth, and the restoration of the House of Stuart.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the critical and poetical faculties are not only\r\ndistinct, but almost incompatible. The state of our literature during\r\nthe reigns of Elizabeth and James the First is a strong confirmation of\r\nthis {342}remark. The greatest works of imagination that the world\r\nhas ever seen were produced at that period. The national taste, in\r\nthe meantime, was to the last degree detestable. Alliterations,\r\npuns, antithetical forms of expression lavishly employed where no\r\ncorresponding opposition existed between the thoughts expressed,\r\nstrained allegories, pedantic allusions, everything, in short, quaint\r\nand affected, in matter and manner, made up what was then considered\r\nas fine writing. The eloquence of the bar, the pulpit, and the\r\ncouncil-board, was deformed by conceits which would have disgraced\r\nthe rhyming shepherds of an Italian academy. The king quibbled on the\r\nthrone. We might, indeed, console ourselves by reflecting that his\r\nmajesty was a fool. But the chancellor quibbled in concert from the\r\nwool-sack: and the chancellor was Francis Bacon. It is needless to\r\nmention Sidney and the whole tribe of Euphuists; for Shakspeare himself,\r\nthe greatest poet that ever lived, falls into the same fault whenever he\r\nmeans to be particularly fine. While he abandons himself to the impulse\r\nof his imagination, his compositions are not only the sweetest and the\r\nmost sublime, but also the most faultless, that the world has ever seen.\r\nBut, as soon as his critical powers come into play, he sinks to the\r\nlevel of Cowley; or rather he does ill what Cowley did well. All that\r\nis bad in his works is bad elaborately, and of malice aforethought. The\r\nonly thing wanting to make them perfect was, that he should never have\r\ntroubled himself with thinking whether they were good or not. Like the\r\nangels in Milton, he sinks “with compulsion and laborious flight.” His\r\nnatural tendency is upwards. That he may soar, it is only necessary that\r\nhe should not struggle to fall. He resembles an American {343}Cacique,\r\nwho, possessing in unmeasured abundance the metals which in polished\r\nsocieties are esteemed the most precious, was utterly unconscious of\r\ntheir value, and gave up treasures more valuable than the imperial\r\ncrowns of other countries, to secure some gaudy and far-fetched but\r\nworthless bauble, a plated button, or a necklace of coloured glass.\r\n\r\nWe have attempted to show that, as knowledge is extended and as the\r\nreason developes itself, the imitative arts decay. We should, therefore,\r\nexpect that the corruption of poetry would commence in the educated\r\nclasses of society. And this, in fact, is almost constantly the case.\r\nThe few great works of imagination which appear in a critical age are,\r\nalmost without exception, the works of uneducated men. Thus, at a\r\ntime when persons of quality translated French romances, and when the\r\nuniversities celebrated royal deaths in verses about tritons and fauns,\r\na preaching tinker produced the Pilgrim’s Progress. And thus a ploughman\r\nstartled a generation which had thought Hayley and Beattie great poets,\r\nwith the adventures of Tam O’Shanter. Even in the latter part of the\r\nreign of Elizabeth the fashionable poetry had degenerated. It retained\r\nfew vestiges of the imagination of earlier times. It had not yet been\r\nsubjected to the rules of good taste. Affectation had completely tainted\r\nmadrigals and sonnets. The grotesque conceits and the tuneless numbers\r\nof Donne were, in the time of James, the favourite models of composition\r\nat Whitehall and at the Temple. But, though the literature of the Court\r\nwas in its decay, the literature of the people was in its perfection.\r\nThe Muses had taken sanctuary in the theatres, the haunts of a class\r\nwhose taste was not better than that of the Right Honourables and\r\n{344}singular good Lords who admired metaphysical love-verses, but whose\r\nimagination retained all its freshness and vigour; whose censure and\r\napprobation might be erroneously bestowed, but whose tears and laughter\r\nwere never in the wrong. The infection which had tainted lyric and\r\ndidactic poetry had but slightly and partially touched the drama. While\r\nthe noble and the learned were comparing eyes to burning-glasses, and\r\ntears to terrestrial globes, coyness to an enthymeme, absence to a pair\r\nof compasses, and an unrequited passion to the fortieth remainder-man in\r\nan entail, Juliet leaning from the balcony, and Miranda smiling over the\r\nchess-board, sent home many spectators, as kind and simple-hearted\r\nas the master and mistress of Fletcher’s Ralpho, to cry themselves to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nNo species of fiction is so delightful to us as the old English drama.\r\nEven its inferior productions possess a charm not to be found in any\r\nother kind of poetry. It is the most lucid mirror that ever was held up\r\nto nature. The creations of the great dramatists of Athens produce the\r\neffect of magnificent sculptures, conceived by a mighty imagination,\r\npolished with the utmost delicacy, embodying ideas of ineffable majesty\r\nand beauty, but cold, pale, and rigid, with no bloom on the check, and\r\nno speculation in the eye. In all the draperies, the figures, and the\r\nfaces, in the lovers and the tyrants, the Bacchanals and the Furies,\r\nthere is the same marble chillness and deadness. Most of the characters\r\nof the French stage resemble the waxen gentlemen and ladies in the\r\nwindow of a perfumer, rouged, curled, and bedizened, but fixed in\r\nsuch stiff attitudes, and staring with eyes expressive of such utter\r\nunmeaningness, that they cannot produce an illusion for a single\r\nmoment. In the English plays alone is to {345}be found the warmth, the\r\nmellowness, and the reality of painting. We know the minds of the men\r\nand women, as we know the faces of the men and women of Vandyke.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of these works is in a great measure the result of\r\ntwo peculiarities, which the critics of the French school consider as\r\ndefects,--from the mixture of tragedy and comedy, and from the length\r\nand extent of the action. The former is necessary to render the drama a\r\njust representation of a world in which the laughers and the weepers are\r\nperpetually jostling each other,--in which every event has its\r\nserious and ludicrous side. The latter enables us to form an intimate\r\nacquaintance with characters with which we could not possibly become\r\nfamiliar during the few hours to which the unities restrict the poet.\r\nIn this respect, the works of Shakspeare, in particular, are miracles\r\nof art. In a piece, which may be read aloud in three hours, we see a\r\ncharacter gradually unfold all its recesses to us. We see it change with\r\nthe change of circumstances. The petulant youth rises into the politic\r\nand warlike sovereign. The profuse and courteous philanthropist sours\r\ninto a hater and scorn er of his kind. The tyrant is altered, by the\r\nchastening of affliction, into a pensive moralist. The veteran general,\r\ndistinguished by coolness, sagacity, and self-command, sinks under a\r\nconflict between love strong as death, and jealousy cruel as the grave.\r\nThe brave and loyal subject passes, step by step, to the extremities\r\nof human depravity. We trace his progress, from the first dawnings of\r\nunlawful ambition to the cynical melancholy of his impenitent remorse.\r\nYet, in these pieces, there are no unnatural transitions. Nothing is\r\nomitted: nothing is crowded. Great as are the changes, narrow as is\r\n{346}the compass within which they are exhibited, they shock us as\r\nlittle as the gradual alterations of those familiar faces which we see\r\nevery evening and every morning. The magical skill of the poet resembles\r\nthat of the Dervise in the Spectator, who condensed all the events of\r\nseven years into the single moment during which the king held his head\r\nunder the water.\r\n\r\nIt is deserving of remark, that, at the time of which we speak, the\r\nplays even of men not eminently distinguished by genius,--such, for\r\nexample, as Jonson,--were far superior to the best works of imagination\r\nin other departments. Therefore, though we conceive that, from causes\r\nwhich we have already investigated, our poetry must necessarily have\r\ndeclined, we think that, unless its fate had been accelerated by\r\nexternal attacks, it might have enjoyed an euthanasia, that genius might\r\nhave been kept alive by the drama till its place could, in some degree,\r\nbe supplied by taste,--that there would have been scarcely any interval\r\nbetween the age of sublime invention and that of agreeable imitation.\r\nThe works of Shakspeare, which were not appreciated with any degree of\r\njustice before the middle of the eighteenth century, might then have\r\nbeen the recognized standards of excellence during the latter part of\r\nthe seventeenth; and he and the great Elizabethan writers might have\r\nbeen almost immediately succeeded by a generation of poets similar to\r\nthose who adorn our own times.\r\n\r\nBut the Puritans drove imagination from its last asylum. They prohibited\r\ntheatrical representations, and stigmatised the whole race of dramatists\r\nas enemies of morality and religion. Much that is objectionable may be\r\nfound in the writers whom they reprobated; but whether they took the\r\nbest measures for stopping {347}the evil appears to us very doubtful,\r\nand must, we think, have appeared doubtful to themselves, when, after\r\nthe lapse of a few years, they saw the unclean spirit whom they had cast\r\nout return to his old haunts, with seven others fouler than himself.\r\n\r\nBy the extinction of the drama, the fashionable school of poetry,--a\r\nschool without truth of sentiment or harmony of versification,--without\r\nthe powers of an earlier, or the correctness of a later age,--was left\r\nto enjoy undisputed ascendency. A vicious ingenuity, a morbid quickness\r\nto perceive resemblances and analogies between things apparently\r\nheterogeneous, constituted almost its only claim to admiration. Suckling\r\nwas dead. Milton was absorbed in political and theological controversy.\r\nIf Waller differed from the Cow-lei an sect of writers, he differed for\r\nthe worse. He had as little poetry as they, and much less wit; nor is\r\nthe languor of his verses less offensive than the ruggeedness of theirs.\r\nIn Dedham alone the faint dawn of a better manner was discernible.\r\n\r\nBut, low as was the state of our poetry during the civil war and the\r\nProtectorate, a still deeper fall was at hand. Hitherto our literature\r\nhad been idiomatic. In mind as in situation we had been islanders. The\r\nrevolutions in our taste, like the revolutions in our government, had\r\nbeen settled without the interference of strangers. Had this state of\r\nthings continued, the same just principles of reasoning which, about\r\nthis time, were applied with unprecedented success to every part of\r\nphilosophy would soon have conducted our ancestors to a sounder code of\r\ncriticism. There were already strong signs of improvement. Our prose\r\nhad at length worked itself clear from those quaint conceits which\r\nstill deformed almost every metrical composition. {348}The parliamentary\r\ndebates, and the diplomatic correspondence of that eventful period,\r\nhad contributed much to this reform. In such bustling times, it was\r\nabsolutely necessary to speak and write to the purpose. The absurdities\r\nof Puritanism had, perhaps, done more. At the time when that odious\r\nstyle, which deforms the writings of Hall and of Lord Bacon, was almost\r\nuniversal, had appeared that stupendous work, the English Bible,--a\r\nbook which, if everything else in our language should perish, would\r\nalone suffice to show the whole extent of its beauty and power. The\r\nrespect which the translators felt for the original prevented them from\r\nadding any of the hideous decorations then in fashion. The ground-work\r\nof the version, indeed, was of an earlier age. The familiarity with\r\nwhich the Puritans, on almost every occasion, used the Scriptural\r\nphrases was no doubt very ridiculous; but it produced good effects. It\r\nwas a cant; but it drove out a cant far more offensive.\r\n\r\nThe highest kind of poetry is, in a great measure, independent of those\r\ncircumstances which regulate the style of composition in prose. But with\r\nthat inferior species of poetry which succeeds to it the case is widely\r\ndifferent. In a few years, the good sense and good taste which had\r\nweeded out affectation from moral and political treatises would, in the\r\nnatural course of things, have effected a similar reform in the sonnet\r\nand the ode. The rigour of the victorious sectaries had relaxed.\r\n\r\nA dominant religion is never ascetic. The Government connived at\r\ntheatrical representations. The influence of Shakspeare was once more\r\nfelt. But darker days were approaching. A foreign yoke was to be imposed\r\non our literature. Charles, surrounded by the companions of his long\r\nexile, returned to govern {349}a nation which ought never to have cast\r\nhim out or never to have received him back. Every year which he\r\nhad passed among strangers had rendered him more unfit to rule his\r\ncountrymen. In France he had seen the refractory magistracy humbled, and\r\nroyal prerogative, though exercised by a foreign priest in the name of\r\na child, victorious over all opposition. This spectacle naturally\r\ngratified a prince to whose family the opposition of Parliaments had\r\nbeen so fatal. Politeness was his solitary good quality. The insults\r\nwhich he had suffered in Scotland had taught him to prize it. The\r\neffeminacy and apathy of his disposition fitted him to excel in it. The\r\nelegance and vivacity of the French manners fascinated him. With the\r\npolitical maxims and the social habits of his favourite people, he\r\nadopted their taste in composition, and, when seated on the throne, soon\r\nrendered it fashionable, partly by direct patronage, but still more by\r\nthat contemptible policy which, for a time, made England the last of the\r\nnations, and raised Louis the Fourteenth to a height of power and fame,\r\nsuch as no French sovereign had ever before attained.\r\n\r\nIt was to please Charles that rhyme was first introduced into our plays.\r\nThus, a rising blow, which would at any time have been mortal, was\r\ndealt to the English Drama, then just recovering from its languishing\r\ncondition. Two detestable manners, the indigenous and the imported, were\r\nnow in a state of alternate conflict and amalgamation. The bombastic\r\nmeanness of the new style was blended with the ingenious absurdity of\r\nthe old; and the mixture produced something which the world had never\r\nbefore seen, and which, we hope, it will never see again,--something, by\r\nthe side of which the worst nonsense of all other ages {350}appears to\r\nadvantage,--something, which those who have attempted to caricature it\r\nhave, against their will, been forced to flatter,--of which the tragedy\r\nof Bayes is a very favourable specimen. What Lord Dorset observed\r\nto Edward Howard might have been addressed to almost all his\r\ncontemporaries:--\r\n\r\n               “As skilful divers to the bottom fall\r\n\r\n               Swifter than those who cannot swim at all;\r\n\r\n               So, in this way of writing without thinking,\r\n\r\n               Thou hast a strange alacrity in sinking.”\r\n\r\nFrom this reproach some clever men of the world must be excepted, and\r\namong them Dorset himself. Though by no means great poets, or even good\r\nversifiers, they always wrote with meaning, and sometimes with wit.\r\nNothing indeed more strongly shows to what a miserable state literature\r\nhad fallen, than the immense superiority which the occasional rhymes,\r\ncarelessly thrown on paper by men of this class, possess over the\r\nelaborate productions of almost all the professed authors. The reigning\r\ntaste was so bad, that the success of a writer was in inverse proportion\r\nto his labour, and to his desire of excellence. An exception must be\r\nmade for Butler, who had as much wit and learning as Cowley, and who\r\nknew, what Cowley never knew, how to use them. A great command of good\r\nhomely English distinguishes him still more from the other writers of\r\nthe time. As for Gondibert, those may criticise it who can read\r\nit. Imagination was extinct. Taste was depraved. Poetry, driven from\r\npalaces, colleges, and theatres, had found an asylum in the obscure\r\ndwelling where a Great Man, born out of due season, in disgrace, penury,\r\npain, and blindness, still kept uncontaminated a character and a genius\r\nworthy of a better age. {351}Everything about Milton is wonderful; but\r\nnothing is so wonderful as that, in an age so unfavourable to poetry, he\r\nshould have produced the greatest of modern epic poems. We are not sure\r\nthat this is not in some degree to be attributed to his want of sight.\r\nThe imagination is notoriously most active when the external world\r\nis shut out. In sleep its illusions are perfect. They produce all the\r\neffect of realities. In darkness its visions are always more distinct\r\nthan in the light. Every person who amuses himself with what is called\r\nbuilding castles in the air must have experienced this. We know artists\r\nwho, before they attempt to draw a face from memory, close their eyes,\r\nthat they may recall a more perfect image of the features and the\r\nexpression. We are therefore inclined to believe that the genius\r\nof Milton may have been preserved from the influence of times so\r\nunfavourable to it by his infirmity. Be this as it may, his works at\r\nfirst enjoyed a very small share of popularity. To be neglected by his\r\ncontemporaries was the penalty which he paid for surpassing them.\r\nHis great poem was not generally studied or admired till writers far\r\ninferior to him had, by obsequiously cringing to the public taste,\r\nacquired sufficient favour to reform it.\r\n\r\nOf these, Dryden was the most eminent. Amidst the crowd of authors who,\r\nduring the earlier years of Charles the Second, courted notoriety\r\nby every species of absurdity and affectation, he speedily became\r\nconspicuous. No man exercised so much influence on the age. The reason\r\nis obvious. On no man did the age exercise so much influence. He was\r\nperhaps the greatest of those whom we have designated as the critical\r\npoets; and his literary career exhibited, on a reduced scale, the whole\r\nhistory of the school to which {352}he belonged,--the rudeness and\r\nextravagance of its infancy,--the propriety, the grace, the dignified\r\ngood sense, the temperate splendour of its maturity. His imagination\r\nwas torpid, till it was awakened by his judgment. He began with quaint\r\nparallels and empty mouthing. He gradually acquired the energy of the\r\nsatirist, the gravity of the moralist, the rapture of the lyric poet.\r\nThe revolution through which English literature has been passing, from\r\nthe time of Cowley to that of Scott, may be seen in miniature within the\r\ncompass of his volumes.\r\n\r\nHis life divides itself into two parts. There is some debatable ground\r\non the common frontier; but the line may be drawn with tolerable\r\naccuracy. The year 1678 is that on which we should be inclined to fix\r\nas the date of a great change in his manner. During the preceding period\r\nappeared some of his courtly panegyrics,--his Annus Mirabilis, and\r\nmost of his plays; indeed, all his rhyming tragedies. To the subsequent\r\nperiod belong his best dramas,--All for Love, The Spanish Friar, and\r\nSebastian,--his satires, his translations, his didactic poems, his\r\nfables, and his odes.\r\n\r\nOf the small pieces which were presented to chancellors and princes it\r\nwould scarcely be fair to speak. The greatest advantage which the Fine\r\nArts derive from the extension of knowledge is, that the patronage of\r\nindividuals becomes unnecessary. Some writers still affect to regret the\r\nage of patronage. None but bad writers have reason to regret it. It is\r\nalways an age of general ignorance. Where ten thousand readers are eager\r\nfor the appearance of a book, a small contribution from each makes up\r\na splendid remuneration for the author. Where literature is a\r\nluxury, confined to few, each of them must pay high. If the Empress\r\n{353}Catherine, for example, wanted an epic poem, she must have wholly\r\nsupported the poet;--just as, in a remote country village, a man who\r\nwants a mutton-chop is sometimes forced to take the whole sheep;--a\r\nthing which never happens where the demand is large. But men who pay\r\nlargely for the gratification of their taste will expect to have it\r\nunited with some gratification to their vanity. Flattery is carried to a\r\nshameless extent; and the habit of flattery almost inevitably introduces\r\na false taste into composition. Its language is made up of hyperbolical\r\ncommon-places,--offensive from their triteness,--still more offensive\r\nfrom their extravagance. In no school is the trick of overstepping the\r\nmodesty of nature so speedily acquired. The writer, accustomed to find\r\nexaggeration acceptable and necessary on one subject, uses it on all. It\r\nis not strange, therefore, that the early panegyrical verses of Dryden\r\nshould be made up of meanness and bombast. They abound with the conceits\r\nwhich his immediate predecessors had brought into fashion. But his\r\nlanguage and his versification were already far superior to their’s.\r\n\r\nThe Annus Mirabilis shows great command of expression, and a fine ear\r\nfor heroic rhyme. Here its merits end. Not only has it no claim to be\r\ncalled poetry, but it seems to be the work of a man who could never, by\r\nany possibility, write poetry. Its affected similes are the best part\r\nof it. Gaudy weeds present a more encouraging spectacle than utter\r\nbarrenness. There is scarcely a single stanza in this long work to which\r\nthe imagination seems to have contributed anything. It is produced, not\r\nby creation, but by construction. It is made up, not of pictures, but\r\nof inferences. We will give a single instance, and {354}certainly a\r\nfavourable instance,--a quatrain which Johnson has praised. Dryden is\r\ndescribing the sea-fight with the Dutch.--\r\n\r\n               “Amidst whole heaps of spices lights a ball;\r\n\r\n               And now their odours armed against them fly.\r\n\r\n               Some preciously by shattered porcelain fall.\r\n\r\n               And some by aromatic splinters die.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet should place his readers, as nearly as possible, in the\r\nsituation of the sufferers or the spectators. His narration ought to\r\nproduce feelings similar to those which would be excited by the event\r\nitself. Is this the case here? Who, in a sea-fight, ever thought of the\r\nprice of the china which beats out the brains of a sailor; or of the\r\nodour of the splinter which shatters his leg? It is not by an act of the\r\nimagination, at once calling up the scene before the interior eye, but\r\nby painful meditation,--by turning the subject round and round,--by\r\ntracing out facts into remote consequences,--that these incongruous\r\ntopics are introduced into the description. Homer, it is true,\r\nperpetually uses epithets which are not peculiarly appropriate.\r\nAchilles is the-swift-footed, when he is sitting still. Ulysses is the\r\nmuch-enduring, when he has nothing to endure. Every spear casts a long\r\nshadow, every ox has crooked horns, and every woman a high bosom, though\r\nthese particulars may be quite beside the purpose. In our old ballads a\r\nsimilar practice prevails. The gold is always red, and the ladies always\r\ngay, though nothing whatever may depend on the hue of the gold, or the\r\ntemper of the ladies. But these adjectives are mere customary additions.\r\nThey merge in the substantives to which they are attached. If they at\r\nall colour the idea, it is with a tinge so slight as in no respect to\r\nalter the general effect. In the {355}passage which we have quoted from\r\nDryden the case is very different.._Preciously_ and _aromatic_ divert\r\nour whole attention to themselves, and dissolve the image of the battle\r\nin a moment. The whole poem reminds us of Lucan, and of the worst parts\r\nof Lucan,--the sea-fight in the Bay of Marseilles, for example. The\r\ndescription of the two fleets during the night is perhaps the only\r\npassage which ought to be exempted from this censure. If it was from\r\nthe Annus Mirabilis that Milton formed his opinion, when he pronounced\r\nDryden a good rhymer but no poet, he certainly judged correctly. But\r\nDryden was, as we have said, one of those writers in whom the period of\r\nimagination does not precede, but follow, the period of observation and\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nHis plays, his rhyming plays in particular, are admirable subjects for\r\nthose who wish to study the morbid anatomy of the drama. He was utterly\r\ndestitute of the power of exhibiting real human beings. Even in the far\r\ninferior talent of composing characters out of those elements into\r\nwhich the imperfect process of our reason can resolve them, he was very\r\ndeficient. His men are not even good personifications; they are not\r\nwell-assorted assemblages of qualities. Now and then, indeed, he seizes\r\na very coarse and marked distinction, and gives us, not a likeness, but\r\na strong caricature, in which a single peculiarity is protruded, and\r\neverything else neglected; like the Marquis of Granby at an inn-door,\r\nwhom we know by nothing but his baldness; or Wilkes, who is Wilkes only\r\nin his squint. These are the best specimens of his skill. For most of\r\nhis pictures seem, like Turkey carpets, to have been expressly designed\r\nnot to resemble anything in the heavens above, in the earth beneath, or\r\nin the waters under the earth. {356}The latter manner he practises\r\nmost frequently in his tragedies, the former in his comedies. The comic\r\ncharacters are, without mixture, loathsome and despicable. The men of\r\nEtherege and Vanbrugh are bad enough. Those of Smollett are perhaps\r\nworse. But they do not approach to the Celadons, the Wildbloods, the\r\nWoodalls, and the Rhodophils of Dryden. The vices of these last are\r\nset off by a certain fierce hard impudence, to which we know nothing\r\ncomparable. Their love is the appetite of beasts; their friendship the\r\nconfederacy of knaves. The ladies seem to have been expressly created to\r\nform helps meet for such gentlemen. In deceiving and insulting their\r\nold fathers they do not perhaps exceed the license which, by im memorial\r\nprescription, has been allowed to heroines. But they also cheat at\r\ncards, rob strong boxes, put up their favours to auction, betray their\r\nfriends, abuse their rivals in the style of Billingsgate, and\r\ninvite their lovers in the language of the Piazza. These, it must be\r\nremembered, are not the valets and waiting-women, the Mascarilles and\r\nNerines, but the recognised heroes and heroines, who appear as the\r\nrepresentatives of good society, and who, at the end of the fifth act,\r\nmarry and live very happily ever after. The sensuality, baseness, and\r\nmalice of their natures is unredeemed by any quality of a different\r\ndescription,--by any touch of kindness,--or even by any honest burst of\r\nhearty hatred and revenge. We are in a world where there is no humanity,\r\nno veracity, no sense of shame,--a world for which any good-natured man\r\nwould gladly take in exchange the society of Milton’s devils. But, as\r\nsoon as we enter the regions of Tragedy, we find a great change. There\r\nis no lack of fine sentiment there. Metastasio is surpassed {357}in his\r\nown department. Scuderi is out-scuderied. We are introduced to people\r\nwhose proceedings we can trace to no motive,--of whose feelings we\r\ncan form no more idea than of a sixth sense. We have left a race of\r\ncreatures, whose love is as delicate and affectionate as the passion\r\nwhich an alderman feels for a turtle. We find ourselves among being’s,\r\nwhose love is a purely disinterested emotion,--a loyalty extending to\r\npassive obedience,--a religion, like that of the Quietists, unsupported\r\nby any sanction of hope or fear. We see nothing but despotism without\r\npower, and sacrifices without compensation.\r\n\r\nWe will give a few instances. In Aurengzebe, Arimant, governor of Agra,\r\nfalls in love with his prisoner Indamora. She rejects his suit with\r\nscorn; but assures him that she shall make great use of her power over\r\nhim. He threatens to be angry. She answers, very coolly:\r\n\r\n               “Do not: your anger, like your love, is vain:\r\n\r\n               Whene’er I please, you must be pleased again.\r\n\r\n               Knowing what power I have your will to bend,\r\n\r\n               I’ll use it; for I need just such a friend.\"\r\n\r\nThis is no idle menace. She soon brings a letter addressed to\r\nhis rival,--orders him to read it,--asks him whether he thinks it\r\nsufficiently tender,--and finally commands him to carry it himself. Such\r\ntyranny as this, it may be thought, would justify resistance. Arimant\r\ndoes indeed venture to remonstrate:--\r\n\r\n                   “This fatal paper rather let me tear,\r\n\r\n                   Than, like Bellerophon, my sentence bear.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer of the lady is incomparable:--\r\n\r\n                   “You may; but ’twill not be your best advice;\r\n\r\n                   Twill only give me pains of writing twice.\r\n\r\n                   You know you must obey me, soon or late.\r\n\r\n                   Why should you vainly struggle with your fate?\"\r\n\r\n{358}Poor Arimant seems to be of the same opinion. He mutters something\r\nabout fate and free-will, and walks off with the billet-doux.\r\n\r\nIn the Indian Emperor, Montezuma presents Alméria with a garland as a\r\ntoken of his love, and offers to make her his queen. She replies:--\r\n\r\n               “I take this garland, not as given by you;\r\n\r\n               But as my merit’s and my beauty’s due;\r\n\r\n               As for the crown which you, my slave, possess,\r\n\r\n               To share it with you would but make me less.\"\r\n\r\nIn return for such proofs of tenderness as these, her admirer consents\r\nto murder his two sons and a benefactor to whom he feels the warmest\r\ngratitude. Lyndaraxa, in the Conquest of Granada, assumes the same lofty\r\ntone with Abdelmelech. He complains that she smiles upon his rival.\r\n\r\n               “Lynd. And when did I my power so far resign,\r\n\r\n                   That you should regulate each look of mine?\r\n\r\n               Abdel. Then, when you gave your love, you gave that power.\r\n\r\n               Lynd.’Twas during pleasure--’tis revoked this hour.\r\n\r\n               Abdel. I’ll hate you, and this visit is my last.\r\n\r\n               Lynd. Do, if you can: you know I hold you fast.\"\r\n\r\nThat these passages violate all historical propriety, that sentiments to\r\nwhich nothing similar was ever even affected except by the cavaliers of\r\nEurope, are transferred to Mexico and Agra, is a light accusation. We\r\nhave no objection to a conventional world, an Illyrian puritan, or a\r\nBohemian sea-port. While the faces are good, we care little about the\r\nback-ground. Sir Joshua Reynolds says that the curtains and hangings\r\nin a historical painting ought to be, not velvet or cotton, but merely\r\ndrapery. The same principle should be applied to poetry and romance. The\r\ntruth of character is the first object; the truth of place and time is\r\nto be considered only in the second place. Puff himself could tell the\r\nactor to turn out his toes, and remind him that {359}Keeper Hatton was\r\na great dancer. We wish that, in our own time, a writer of a very\r\ndifferent order from Puff had not too often forgotten human nature in\r\nthe niceties of upholstery, millinery, and cookery.\r\n\r\nWe blame Dryden, not because the persons of his dramas are not Moors or\r\nAmericans, but because they are not men and women;--not because love,\r\nsuch as he represents it, could not exist in a harem or in a wigwam, but\r\nbecause it could not exist anywhere. As is the love of his heroes, such\r\nare all their other emotions. All their qualities, their courage, their\r\ngenerosity, their pride, are on the same colossal scale. Justice and\r\nprudence are virtues which can exist only in a moderate degree, and\r\nwhich change their nature and their name if pushed to excess. Of justice\r\nand prudence, therefore, Dryden leaves his favourites destitute. He\r\ndid not care to give them what he could not give without measure. The\r\ntyrants and ruffians are merely the heroes altered by a few touches,\r\nsimilar to those which transformed the honest face of Sir Roger de\r\nCoverley into the Saracen’s head. Through the grin and frown the\r\noriginal features are still perceptible.\r\n\r\nIt is in the tragi-comedies that these absurdities strike us most.\r\nThe two races of men, or rather the angels and the baboons, are there\r\npresented to us together. We meet in one scene with nothing but\r\ngross, selfish, unblushing, lying libertines of both sexes, who, as\r\na punishment, we suppose, for their depravity, are condemned to talk\r\nnothing but prose. But, as soon as we meet with people who speak in\r\nverse, we know that we are in society which would have enraptured the\r\nCathos and Madelon of Moliere, in society for which Croondates would\r\nhave too little of the lover, and Clelia too much of the coquette.\r\n{360}As Dryden was unable to render his plays interesting by means of\r\nthat which is the peculiar and appropriate excellence of the drama,\r\nit was necessary that he should find some substitute for it. In his\r\ncomedies he supplied its place, sometimes by wit, but more frequently\r\nby intrigue, by disguises, mistakes of persons, dialogues at cross\r\npurposes, hair-breadth escapes, perplexing concealments, and surprising\r\ndisclosures. He thus succeeded at least in making these pieces very\r\namusing.\r\n\r\nIn his tragedies he trusted, and not altogether without reason, to\r\nhis diction and his versification. It was on this account, in all\r\nprobability, that he so eagerly adopted, and so reluctantly abandoned,\r\nthe practice of rhyming in his plays. What is unnatural appears less\r\nunnatural in that species of verse than in fines which approach more\r\nnearly to common conversation; and in the management of the heroic\r\ncouplet Dryden has never been equalled. It is unnecessary to urge any\r\narguments against a fashion now universally condemned. But it is worthy\r\nof observation, that, though Dryden was deficient in that talent which\r\nblank verse exhibits to the greatest advantage, and was certainly the\r\nbest writer of heroic rhyme in our language, yet the plays which have,\r\nfrom the time of their first appearance, been considered as his best,\r\nare in blank verse. No experiment can be more decisive.\r\n\r\nIt must be allowed that the worst even of the rhyming tragedies contains\r\ngood description and magnificent rhetoric. But, even when we forget that\r\nthey are plays, and, passing by their dramatic improprieties, consider\r\nthem with reference to the language, we are perpetually disgusted by\r\npassages which it is difficult to conceive how any author could have\r\nwritten, or any {361}audience have tolerated, rants in which the raving\r\nviolence of the manner forms a strange contrast with the abject tameness\r\nof the thought. The author laid the whole fault on the audience, and\r\ndeclared that, when he wrote them, he considered them bad enough to\r\nplease. This defence is unworthy of a man of genius, and, after all, is\r\nno defence. Otway pleased without rant; and so might Dryden have done,\r\nif he had possessed the powers of Otway. The fact is, that he had a\r\ntendency to bombast, which, though subsequently corrected by time\r\nand thought, was never wholly removed, and which showed itself in\r\nperformances not designed to please the rude mob of the theatre.\r\n\r\nSome indulgent critics have represented this failing as an indication\r\nof genius, as the profusion of unlimited wealth, the wantonness of\r\nexuberant vigour. To us it seems to bear a nearer affinity to the\r\ntawdriness of poverty, or the spasms and convulsions of weakness. Dryden\r\nsurely had not more imagination than Homer, Dante, or Milton, who\r\nnever fall into this vice. The swelling diction of Æschylus and Isaiah\r\nresembles that of Almanzor and Maximin no more than the tumidity of a\r\nmuscle resembles the tumidity of a boil. The former is symptomatic\r\nof health and strength, the latter of debility and disease. If ever\r\nShakspeare rants, it is not when his imagination is hurrying him along,\r\nbut when he is hurrying his imagination along,--when his mind is for a\r\nmoment jaded,--when, as was said of Euripides, he resembles a lion, who\r\nexcites his own fury by lashing himself with his tail. What happened\r\nto Shakspeare from the occasional suspension of his powers happened\r\nto Dryden from constant impotence. He, like his confederate Lee, had\r\njudgment enough to appreciate the great poets of the preceding age,\r\nbut not {362}judgment enough to shun competition with them. He felt and\r\nadmired their wild and daring sublimity. That it belonged to another age\r\nthan that in which he lived and required other talents than those which\r\nhe possessed, that, in aspiring to emulate it, he was wasting, in\r\na hopeless attempt, powers which might render him pre-eminent in a\r\ndifferent career, was a lesson which he did not learn till late. As\r\nthose knavish enthusiasts, the French prophets, courted inspiration by\r\nmimicking the writhings, swoonings, and gaspings which they considered\r\nas its symptoms, he attempted, by affected fits of poetical fury,\r\nto bring on a real paroxysm; and, like them, he got nothing but his\r\ndistortions for his pains.\r\n\r\nHorace very happily compares those who, in his time, imitated Pindar\r\nto the youth who attempted to fly to heaven on waxen wings, and who\r\nexperienced so fatal and ignominious a fall. His own admirable good\r\nsense preserved him from this error, and taught him to cultivate a\r\nstyle in which excellence was within his reach. Dryden had not the same\r\nself-knowledge. He saw that the greatest poets were never so successful\r\nas when they rushed beyond the ordinary bounds, and that some\r\ninexplicable good fortune preserved them from tripping even when they\r\nstaggered on the brink of nonsense. He did not perceive that they were\r\nguided and sustained by a power denied to himself. They wrote from\r\nthe dictation of the imagination; and they found a response in the\r\nimaginations of others. He, on the contrary, sat down to work himself,\r\nby reflection and argument, into a deliberate wildness, a rational\r\nfrenzy.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the admirable designs which accompany the Faust, we have\r\nalways been much struck by {363}one which represents the wizard and the\r\ntempter riding at full speed. The demon sits on his furious horse as\r\nheedlessly as if he were reposing on a chair. That he should keep his\r\nsaddle in such a posture, would seem impossible to any who did not\r\nknow that he was secure in the privileges of a superhuman nature. The\r\nattitude of Faust, on the contrary, is the perfection of horsemanship.\r\nPoets of the first order might safely write as desperately as\r\nMephistophiles rode. But Dryden, though admitted to communion with\r\nhigher spirits, though armed with a portion of their power, and\r\nintrusted with some of their secrets, was of another race. What they\r\nmight securely venture to do, it was madness in him to attempt. It\r\nwas necessary that taste and critical science should supply his\r\ndeficiencies.\r\n\r\nWe will give a few examples. Nothing can be finer than the description\r\nof Hector at the Grecian wall:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0411]\r\n\r\nWhat daring expressions! Yet how significant! How picturesque! Hector\r\nseems to rise up in his strength and fury. The gloom of night in his\r\nfrown,--the fire burning in his eyes,--the javelins and the\r\nblazing armour,--the mighty rush through the gates and down\r\nthe battlements,--the trampling and the infinite roar of the\r\nmultitude,--everything is with us; everything is real. {364}Dryden has\r\ndescribed a very similar event in Maximin, and has done his best to he\r\nsublime, as follows:--\r\n\r\n               “There with a forest of their darts he strove,\r\n\r\n               And stood like Capaneus defying Jove;\r\n\r\n               With his broad sword the boldest beating down,\r\n\r\n               Till Fate grew pale, lest he should win the town,\r\n\r\n               And turned the iron leaves of its dark book\r\n\r\n               To make new dooms, or mend what it mistook.\"\r\n\r\nHow exquisite is the imagery of the fairy songs in the Tempest and in\r\nthe Midsummer Night’s Dream; Ariel riding through the twilight on the\r\nbat, or sucking in the bells of flowers with the bee; or the little\r\nbower-women of Titania, driving the spiders from the couch of the Queen!\r\nDryden truly said, that\r\n\r\n               “Shakspeare’s magic could not copied be:\r\n\r\n               Within that circle none durst walk but he.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been well if he had not himself dared to step within\r\nthe enchanted line, and drawn on himself a fate similar to that\r\nwhich, according to the old superstition, punished such presumptuous\r\ninterference. The following lines are parts of the song of his\r\nfairies:--\r\n\r\n               “Merry, merry, merry, we sail from the East,\r\n\r\n               Half-tippled at a rainbow feast.\r\n\r\n               In the bright moonshine, while winds whistle loud,\r\n\r\n               Tivv, tivy, tivy, we mount and we fly,\r\n\r\n               All racking along in a downy white cloud;\r\n\r\n               And lest our leap from the sky prove too far,\r\n\r\n               We slide on the back of a new falling star,\r\n\r\n               And drop from above\r\n\r\n               In a jelly of love.\"\r\n\r\nThese are very favourable instances. Those who wish for a bad one may\r\nread the dying speeches of Maximin, and may compare them with the last\r\nscenes of Othello and Lear.\r\n\r\nIf Dryden had died before the expiration of the first of the periods\r\ninto which we have divided his literary {365}life, he would have left\r\na reputation, at best, little higher than that of Lee or Davenant. He\r\nwould have been known only to men of letters; and by them he would have\r\nbeen mentioned as a writer who threw away, on subjects which he was\r\nincompetent to treat, powers which, judiciously employed, might have\r\nraised him to eminence; whose diction and whose numbers had sometimes\r\nvery high merit; but all whose works were blemished by a false taste,\r\nand by errors of gross negligence. A few of his prologues and epilogues\r\nmight perhaps still have been remembered and quoted. In these little\r\npieces he early showed all the powers which afterwards rendered him the\r\ngreatest of modern satirists. But, during the latter part of his\r\nlife, he gradually abandoned the drama. His plays appeared at longer\r\nintervals. He renounced rhyme in tragedy. His language became less\r\nturgid--his characters less exaggerated. He did not indeed produce\r\ncorrect representations of human nature; but he ceased to daub such\r\nmonstrous chimeras as those which abound in his earlier pieces. Here and\r\nthere passages occur worthy of the best ages of the British stage. The\r\nstyle which the drama requires changes with every change of character\r\nand situation. He who can vary his manner to suit the variation is the\r\ngreat dramatist; but he who excels in one manner only will, when that\r\nmanner happens to be appropriate, appear to be a great dramatist; as the\r\nhands of a watch which does not go point right once in the twelve hours.\r\nSometimes there is a scene of solemn debate. This a mere rhetorician may\r\nwrite as well as the greatest tragedian that ever lived. We confess\r\nthat to us the speech of Sempronius in Cato seems very nearly as good\r\nas Shakspeare could have made it. But when the senate breaks up,\r\nand {366}we find that the lovers and their mistresses, the hero, the\r\nvillain, and the deputy-villain, all continue to harangue in the same\r\nstyle, we perceive the difference between a man who can write a play\r\nand a man who can write a speech. In the same manner, wit, a talent\r\nfor description, or a talent for narration, may, for a time, pass for\r\ndramatic genius. Dryden was an incomparable reasoned in verse. He was\r\nconscious of his power; he was proud of it; and the authors of\r\nthe Rehearsal justly charged him with abusing it. His warriors and\r\nprincesses are fond of discussing points of amorous casuistry, such\r\nas would have delighted a Parliament of Love. They frequently go still\r\ndeeper, and speculate on philosophical necessity and the origin of evil.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, some occasions which absolutely required this\r\npeculiar talent. Then Dryden was indeed at home. All his best scenes are\r\nof this description. They are all between men; for the heroes of Dryden,\r\nlike many other gentlemen, can never talk sense when ladies are in\r\ncompany. They are all intended to exhibit the empire of reason\r\nover violent passion. We have two interlocutors, the one eager and\r\nimpassioned, the other high, cool, and judicious. The composed and\r\nrational character gradually acquires the ascendency. His fierce\r\ncompanion is first inflamed to rage by his reproaches, then overawed\r\nby his equanimity, convinced by his arguments, and soothed by his\r\npersuasions. This is the case in the scene between Hector and Troilus,\r\nin that between Antony and Ventidius, and in that between Sebastian and\r\nDorax. Nothing of the same kind in Shakspeare is equal to them, except\r\nthe quarrel between Brutus and Cassius, which is worth them all three.\r\n{367}Some years before his death, Dryden altogether ceased to write for\r\nthe stage. He had turned his powers in a new direction, with success\r\nthe most splendid and decisive. His taste had gradually awakened his\r\ncreative faculties. The first rank in poetry was beyond his reach; but\r\nhe challenged and secured the most honorable place in the second. His\r\nimagination resembled the wings of an ostrich. It enabled him to run,\r\nthough not to soar. When he attempted the highest flights, he became\r\nridiculous; but, while he remained in a lower region, he outstripped all\r\ncompetitors.\r\n\r\nAll his natural and all his acquired powers fitted him to found a good\r\ncritical school of poetry. Indeed he carried his reforms too far for\r\nhis age. After his death, our literature retrograded: and a century was\r\nnecessary to bring it back to the point at which he left it. The general\r\nsoundness and healthfulness of his mental constitution, his information\r\nof vast superficies though of small volume, his wit scarcely inferior to\r\nthat of the most distinguished followers of Donne, his eloquence, grave,\r\ndeliberate, and commanding, could not save him from disgraceful failure\r\nas a rival of Shakspeare, but raised him far above the level of Boileau.\r\nHis command of language was immense. With him died the secret of the\r\nold poetical diction of England,--the art of producing rich effects by\r\nfamiliar words. In the following century, it was as completely lost as\r\nthe Gothic method of painting glass, and was but poorly supplied by\r\nthe laborious and tesselated imitations of Mason and Gray. On the\r\nother hand, he was the first writer under whose skilful management the\r\nscientific vocabulary fell into natural and pleasing verse. In this\r\ndepartment, he succeeded as completely as his contemporary Gibbons\r\nsucceeded in the similar {368}enterprise of carving the most delicate\r\nflowers from heart of oak. The toughest and most knotty parts of\r\nlanguage became ductile at his touch. His versification in the same\r\nmanner, while it gave the first model of that neatness and precision\r\nwhich the following generation esteemed so highly, exhibited, at the\r\nsame time, the last examples of nobleness, freedom, variety of pause,\r\nand cadence. His tragedies in rhyme, however worthless in themselves,\r\nhad at least served the purpose of nonsense-verses; they had taught him\r\nall the arts of melody which the heroic couplet admits. For bombast, his\r\nprevailing vice, his new subjects gave little opportunity; his better\r\ntaste gradually discarded it.\r\n\r\nHe possessed, as we have said, in a pre-eminent degree, the power of\r\nreasoning in verse; and this power was now peculiarly useful to him. His\r\nlogic is by no means uniformly sound. On points of criticism, he always\r\nreasons ingeniously; and, when he is disposed to be honest, correctly.\r\nBut the theological and political questions which he undertook to treat\r\nin verse were precisely those which he understood least. His arguments,\r\ntherefore, are often worthless. But the manner in which they are stated\r\nis beyond all praise. The style is transparent. The topics follow each\r\nother in the happiest order. The objections are drawn up in such a\r\nmanner that the whole fire of the reply may be brought to bear on them.\r\nThe circumlocutions which are substituted for technical phrases are\r\nclear, neat, and exact. The illustrations at once adorn and elucidate\r\nthe reasoning. The sparkling epigrams of Cowley, and the simple\r\ngarrulity of the buidesque poets of Italy, are alternately employed, in\r\nthe happiest manner, to give effect to what is obvious, or clearness\r\nto what is obscure. {369}His literary creed was catholic, even\r\nto latitudinarianism; not from any want of acuteness, but from a\r\ndisposition to be easily satisfied. He was quick to discern the smallest\r\nglimpse of merit; he was indulgent even to gross improprieties, when\r\naccompanied by any redeeming talent. When he said a severe thing, it\r\nwas to serve a temporary purpose,--to support an argument, or to tease a\r\nrival. Never was so able a critic so free from fastidiousness. He loved\r\nthe old poets, especially Shakspeare. He admired the ingenuity which\r\nDonne and Cowley had so wildly abused. He did justice, amidst the\r\ngeneral silence, to the memory of Milton. He praised to the skies the\r\nschool-boy lines of Addison. Always looking on the fair side of every\r\nobject, he admired extravagance on account of the invention which he\r\nsupposed it to indicate; he excused affectation in favour of wit; he\r\ntolerated even tameness for the sake of the correctness which was its\r\nconcomitant.\r\n\r\nIt was probably to this turn of mind, rather than to the more\r\ndisgraceful causes which Johnson has assigned, that we are to attribute\r\nthe exaggeration which dis-’figures the panegyrics of Dryden. No writer,\r\nit must be owned, has carried the flattery of dedication to a greater\r\nlength. But this was not, we suspect, merely interested servility: it\r\nwas the overflowing of a mind singularly disposed to admiration,--of a\r\nmind which diminished vices, and magnified virtues and obligations. The\r\nmost adulatory of his addresses is that in which he dedicates the State\r\nof Innocence to Mary of Modena. Johnson thinks it strange that any\r\nman should use such language without self-detestation. But he has not\r\nremarked that to the very same work is prefixed an eulogium on Milton,\r\nwhich certainly could not have {370}been acceptable at the court of\r\nCharles the Second. Many years later, when Whig principles were in a\r\ngreat measure triumphant, Sprat refused to admit a monument of John\r\nPhilips into Westminster Abbey--because, in the epitaph, the name of\r\nMilton incidently occurred. The walls of his church, he declared, should\r\nnot be polluted by the name of a republican! Dryden was attached, both\r\nby principle and interest, to the Court. But nothing could deaden his\r\nsensibility to excellence. We are unwilling to accuse him severely,\r\nbecause the same disposition, which prompted him to pay so generous a\r\ntribute to the memory of a poet whom his patrons detested, hurried him\r\ninto extravagance when he described a princess distinguished by the\r\nsplendour of her beauty and the graciousness of her manners.\r\n\r\nThis is an amiable temper; but it is not the temper of great men. Where\r\nthere is elevation of character, there will be fastidiousness. It\r\nis only in novels and on tombstones that we meet with people who are\r\nindulgent to the faults of others, and unmerciful to their own; and\r\nDry den, at all events, was not one of these paragons. His charity was\r\nextended most liberally to » others; but it certainly began at home. In\r\ntaste he was by no means deficient. His critical work! are, beyond all\r\ncomparison, superior to any which had, till then, appeared in England.\r\nThey were generally intended as apologies for his own poems, rather than\r\nas expositions of general principles; he, therefore, often attempts\r\nto deceive the reader by sophistry which could scarcely have\r\ndeceived himself. His dicta are the dicta, not of a judge, but of an\r\nadvocate;--often of an advocate in an unsound cause. Yet, in the very\r\nact of misrepresenting the laws of composition, he shows how {371}well\r\nhe understands them. But he was perpetually acting against his better\r\nknowledge. His sins were sins against light. He trusted that what was\r\nbad would be pardoned for the sake of what was good. What was good, he\r\ntook no pains to make better. He was not, like most persons who rise to\r\neminence, dissatisfied even with his best productions. He had set up no\r\nunattainable standard of perfection, the contemplation of which might\r\nat once improve and mortify him. His path was not attended by an\r\nunapproachable mirage of excellence, for ever receding, and for ever\r\npursued. He was not disgusted by the negligence of others; and he\r\nextended the same toleration to himself. His mind was of a slovenly\r\ncharacter,--fond of splendour, but indifferent to neatness. Hence most\r\nof his writings exhibit the sluttish magnificence of a Russian noble,\r\nall vermin and diamonds, dirty linen and inestimable sables. Those\r\nfaults which spring from affectation, time and thought in a great\r\nmeasure removed from his poems. But his carelessness he retained to the\r\nlast. If towards the close of his life he less frequently went wrong\r\nfrom negligence, it was only because long habits of composition\r\nrendered it more easy to go right. In his best pieces we find false\r\nrhymes,--triplets, in which the third line appears to be a mere\r\nintruder, and, while it breaks the music, adds nothing to the\r\nmeaning,--gigantic Alexandrines of fourteen and sixteen syllables,\r\nand truncated verses for which he never troubled himself to find a\r\ntermination or a partner.\r\n\r\nSuch are the beauties and the faults which may be found in profusion\r\nthroughout the later works of Dry-den. A more just and complete estimate\r\nof his natural and acquired powers,--of the merits of his style and of\r\nits blemishes,--may be formed from the Hind and {372}Panther, than from\r\nany of his other writings. As a didactic poem, it is far superior to\r\nthe Religio Laici. The satirical parts, particularly the character\r\nof Burnet, are scarcely inferior to the best passages in Absalom and\r\nAchitophel. There are, moreover, occasional touches of a tenderness\r\nwhich effects us more, because it is decent, rational, and manly, and\r\nreminds us of the best scenes in his tragedies. His versification sinks\r\nand swells in happy unison with the subject; and his wealth of\r\nlanguage seems to be unlimited. Yet, the carelessness with which he has\r\nconstructed his plot, and the innumerable inconsistencies into which\r\nhe is every moment falling, detract much from the pleasure which such\r\nvarious excellence affords.\r\n\r\nIn Absalom and Achitophel he hit upon a new and rich vein, which he\r\nworked with signal success. The ancient satirists were the subjects of\r\na despotic government. They were compelled to abstain from political\r\ntopics, and to confine their attention to the frailties of private life.\r\nThey might, indeed, sometimes venture to take liberties with public men,\r\n“Quorum Flaminia tegitur cinis atque Latina.”\r\n\r\nThus Juvenal immortalised the obsequious senators who met to decide the\r\nfate of the memorable turbot. His fourth satire frequently reminds us of\r\nthe great political poem of Dryden; but it was not written till Domitian\r\nhad fallen: and it wants something of the peculiar flavour which belongs\r\nto contemporary invective alone. His anger has stood so long that,\r\nthough the body is not impaired, the effervescence, the first cream,\r\nis gone. Boileau lay under similar restraints; and, if he had been free\r\nfrom all restraint, would have been no match for our countryman.\r\n\r\nThe advantages which Dryden derived from the nature {373}of his subject\r\nhe improved to the very utmost. His maimer is almost perfect. The style\r\nof Horace and Boileau is fit only for light subjects. The Frenchman\r\ndid indeed attempt to turn the theological reasonings of the Provincial\r\nLetters into verse, but with very indifferent success. The glitter of\r\nPope is cold. The ardour of Persius is without brilliancy. Magnificent\r\nversification and ingenious combinations rarely harmonise with the\r\nexpression of deep feeling. In Juvenal and Dryden alone we have the\r\nsparkle and the heat together. Those great satirists succeeded in\r\ncommunicating; the fervour of their feelings to materials the most\r\nincombustible, and kindled the whole mass into a blaze, at once dazzling\r\nand destructive. We cannot, indeed, think, without regret, of the part\r\nwhich so eminent a writer as Dryden took in the disputes of that period.\r\nThere was, no doubt, madness and wickedness on both sides. But there was\r\nliberty on the one, and despotism on the other. On this point, however,\r\nwe will not dwell. At Talavera the English and French troops for a\r\nmoment suspended their conflict, to drink of a stream which flowed\r\nbetween them. The shells were passed across from enemy to enemy without\r\napprehension or molestation. We, in the same manner, would rather\r\nassist our political adversaries to drink with us of that fountain of\r\nintellectual pleasure, which should be the common refreshment of both\r\nparties, than disturb and pollute it with the havock of unseasonable\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\nMacflenoe is inferior to Absalom and Achitophel, only in the subject.\r\nIn the execution it is even superior. But the greatest work of Dryden\r\nwas the last, the Ode on Saint Cecilia’s day. It is the master-piece\r\nof the second class of poetry, and ranks but just below {374}the great\r\nmodels of the first. It reminds us of the Pedasus of Achilles.\r\n\r\nBy comparing it with the impotent ravings of the heroic tragedies,\r\nwe may measure the progress which the mind of Dryden had made. He had\r\nlearned to avoid a too audacious competition with higher natures, to\r\nkeep at a distance from the verge of bombast or nonsense, to venture\r\non no expression which did not convey a distinct idea to his own mind.\r\nThere is none of that “darkness visible” of style which he had formerly\r\naffected, and in which the greatest poets only can succeed. Everything\r\nis definite, significant, and picturesque. His early writings resembled\r\nthe gigantic works of those Chinese gardeners who attempt to rival\r\nnature herself, to form cataracts of terrific height and sound, to\r\nraise precipitous ridges of mountains, and to imitate in artificial\r\nplantations the vastness and the gloom of some primeval forest. This\r\nmanner he abandoned; nor did he ever adopt the Dutch taste which Pope\r\naffected, the trim parterres, and the rectangular walks. He rather\r\nresembled our Kents and Browns, who, imitating the great features of\r\nlandscape without emulating them, consulting the genius of the place,\r\nassisting nature and carefully disguising their art, produced, not a\r\nChainouni or a Niagara, but a Stowe or a Hagley.\r\n\r\nWe are, on the whole, inclined to regret that Dryden did not accomplish\r\nhis purpose of writing an epic poem. It certainly would not have been\r\na work of the highest rank. It would not have rivalled the Iliad, the\r\nOdyssey, or the Paradise Lost; but it would have been superior to the\r\nproductions of Apollonius, Lucan, or Statius, and not inferior to\r\nthe Jerusalem Delivered. {375}It would probably have been a vigorous\r\nnarrative, animated with something of the spirit of the old romances,\r\nenriched with much splendid description, and interspersed with fine\r\ndeclamations and disquisitions. The danger of Dryden would have been\r\nfrom aiming too high; from dwelling too much, for example, on his angels\r\nof kingdoms, and attempting a competition with that great writer who\r\nin his own time had so incomparably succeeded in representing to us the\r\nsights and sounds of another world. To Milton, and to Milton alone,\r\nbelonged the secrets of the great deep, the beach of sulphur, the ocean\r\nof fire, the palaces of the fallen dominations, glimmering through the\r\neverlasting shade, the silent wilderness of verdure and fragrance where\r\narmed angels kept watch over the sleep of the first lovers, the portico\r\nof diamond, the sea of jasper, the sapphire pavement empurpled with\r\ncelestial roses, and the infinite ranks of the Cherubim, blazing with\r\nadamant and gold. The council, the tournament, the procession, the\r\ncrowded cathedral, the camp, the guardroom, the chase, were the proper\r\nscenes for Dryden.\r\n\r\nBut we have not space to pass in review all the works which Dryden\r\nwrote. We, therefore, will not speculate longer on those which he might\r\npossibly have written. He may, on the whole, be pronounced to have been\r\na man possessed of splendid talents, which he often abused, and of a\r\nsound judgment, the admonitions of which he often neglected; a man who\r\nsucceeded only in an inferior department of his art, but who, in that\r\ndepartment, succeeded pre-eminently; and who, with a more independent\r\nspirit, a more anxious desire of excellence, and more respect for\r\nhimself, would, in his own walk, have attained to absolute perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY. (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n{376}(_Edinburgh Review_, May 1828.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo write history respectably--that is, to abbreviate despatches, and\r\nmake extracts from speeches, to intersperse in due proportion epithets\r\nof praise and abhorrence, to draw up antithetical characters of great\r\nmen, setting forth how many contradictory virtues and vices they united,\r\nand abounding in _withs_ and _withouts_--all this is very easy. But\r\nto be a really great historian is perhaps the rarest of intellectual\r\ndistinctions. Many scientific works are, in their kind, absolutely\r\nperfect. There are poems which we should be inclined to designate as\r\nfaultless, or as disfigured only by blemishes which pass unnoticed in\r\nthe general blaze of excellence. There are speeches, some speeches of\r\nDemosthenes particularly, in which it would be impossible to alter a\r\nword without altering it for the worse. But we are acquainted with\r\nno history which approaches to our notion of what a history ought to\r\nbe--with no history which does not widely depart, either on the right\r\nhand or on the left, from the exact line.\r\n\r\nThe cause may easily be assigned. This province of literature is a\r\ndebatable land. It lies on the confines of two distinct territories. It\r\nis under the\r\n\r\n     (1) _The Romance of History. England_. By Henry Neete.\r\n     London, 1828.\r\n\r\njurisdiction {377}of two hostile powers; and, like other districts\r\nsimilarly situated, it is ill-defined, ill cultivated, and ill\r\nregulated. Instead of being equally shared between its two rulers, the\r\nReason and the Imagination, it falls alternately under the sole and\r\nabsolute dominion of each. It is sometimes fiction. It is sometimes\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nHistory, it has been said, is philosophy teaching by examples.\r\nUnhappily, what the philosophy gains in soundness and depth the examples\r\ngenerally lose in vividness. A perfect historian must possess an\r\nimagination sufficiently powerful to make his narrative affecting and\r\npicturesque. Yet he must control it so absolutely as to content himself\r\nwith the materials which he finds, and to refrain from supplying\r\ndeficiencies by additions of his own. He must be a profound and\r\ningenious reasoner. Yet he must possess sufficient self-command to\r\nabstain from casting his facts in the mould of his hypothesis. Those who\r\ncan justly estimate these almost insuperable difficulties will not think\r\nit strange that every writer should have failed, either in the narrative\r\nor in the speculative department of history.\r\n\r\nIt may be laid down as a general rule, though subject to considerable\r\nqualifications and exceptions, that _history begins in novel and ends\r\nin essay_. Of the romantic historians Herodotus is the earliest and the\r\nbest. His animation, his simple-hearted tenderness, his wonderful talent\r\nfor description and dialogue, and the pure sweet flow of his language,\r\nplace him at the head of narrators. He reminds us of a delightful child.\r\nThere is a grace beyond the reach of affectation in his awkwardness, a\r\nmalice in his innocence, an intelligence in his nonsense, an insinuating\r\neloquence in his lisp. We know of no writer who makes such {378}interest\r\nfor himself and his hook in the heart of the reader. At the distance\r\nof three-and-twenty centuries, we feel for him the same sort of pitying\r\nfondness which Fontaine and Gay are said to have inspired in society.\r\nHe has written an incomparable book. He has written something better\r\nperhaps than the best history; but he has not written a good history;\r\nhe is, from the first to the last chapter, an inventor. We do not here\r\nrefer merely to those gross fictions with which he has been reproached\r\nby the critics of later times. We speak of that colouring which is\r\nequally diffused over his whole narrative, and which perpetually leaves\r\nthe most sagacious reader in doubt what to reject and what to receive.\r\nThe most authentic parts of his work bear the same relation to his\r\nwildest legends which Henry the Fifth bears to the Tempest. There was\r\nan expedition undertaken by Xerxes against Greece; and there was an\r\ninvasion of France. There was a battle at Platæa; and there was a battle\r\nat Agincourt. Cambridge and Exeter, the Constable and the Dauphin,\r\nwere persons as real as Demaratus and Pausa-nias. The harangue of the\r\nArchbishop on the Salic Law and the Book of Numbers differs much less\r\nfrom the orations which have in all ages proceeded from the right\r\nreverend bench than the speeches of Mardonius and Artabanus from those\r\nwhich were delivered at the council-board of Susa. Shakspeare gives us\r\nenumerations of armies, and returns of killed and wounded, which are\r\nnot, we suspect, much less accurate than those of Herodotus. There are\r\npassages in Herodotus nearly as long as acts of Shakspeare, in which\r\neverything is told dramatically, and in which the narrative serves only\r\nthe purpose of stage-directions. It is possible, no doubt, that the\r\nsubstance of some real conversations{379} may have been reported to the\r\nhistorian. But events, which, if they ever happened, happened in ages\r\nand nations so remote that the particulars could never have been known\r\nto him, are related with the greatest minuteness of detail. We have all\r\nthat Candaules said to Gyges, and all that passed between Astyages and\r\nHarpagus. We are, therefore, unable to judge whether, in the account\r\nwhich he gives of transactions respecting which he might possibly have\r\nbeen well informed, we can trust to anything beyond the naked outline;\r\nwhether, for example, the answer of Gelon to the ambassadors of the\r\nGrecian confederacy, or the expressions which passed between Aristides\r\nand Themistocles at their famous interview, have been correctly\r\ntransmitted to us. The great events, are, no doubt, faithfully related.\r\nSo, probably, are many of the slighter circumstances; but which of them\r\nit is impossible to ascertain. The fictions are so much like the facts,\r\nand the facts so much like the fictions, that, with respect to many most\r\ninteresting particulars, our belief is neither given nor withheld, but\r\nremains in an uneasy and interminable state of abeyance. We know that\r\nthere is truth; but we cannot exactly decide where it lies.\r\n\r\nThe faults of Herodotus are the faults of a simple and imaginative\r\nmind. Children and servants are remarkably Herodotean in their style of\r\nnarration. They tell everything dramatically. Their _says hes_ and _says\r\nshes_ are proverbial. Every person who has had to settle their disputes\r\nknows that, even when they have no intention to deceive, their reports\r\nof conversation always require to be carefully sifted. If an educated\r\nman were giving an account of the late change of administration, he\r\nwould say--“Lord Goderich resigned; {380}and the King, in consequence,\r\nsent for the Duke of Wellington.” A porter tells the story as if he\r\nhad been hid behind the curtains of the royal bed at Windsor: “So Lord\r\nGoderich says, ‘I cannot manage this business; I must go out.’ So\r\nthe King says,--says he, ‘Well, then, I must send for the Duke of\r\nWellington--that’s all.’” This is in the very manner of the father of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nHerodotus wrote as it was natural that he should write. He wrote for a\r\nnation susceptible, curious, lively, insatiably desirous of novelty\r\nand excitement; for a nation in which the fine arts had attained their\r\nhighest excellence, but in which philosophy was still in its infancy.\r\nHis countrymen had but recently begun to cultivate prose composition.\r\nPublic transactions had generally been recorded in verse. The first\r\nhistorians might, therefore, indulge without fear of censure in the\r\nlicense allowed to their predecessors the bards. Books were few. The\r\nevents of former times were learned from tradition and from popular\r\nballads; the manners of foreign countries from the reports of\r\ntravellers. It is well known that the mystery which overhangs what is\r\ndistant, either in space or time, frequently prevents us from censuring\r\nas unnatural what we perceive to be impossible. We stare at a dragoon\r\nwho has killed three French cuirassiers, as a prodigy; yet we read,\r\nwithout the least disgust, how Godfrey slew his thousands, and Rinaldo\r\nhis ten thousands. Within the last hundred years, stories about China\r\nand Bantam, which ought not to have imposed on an old nurse, were\r\ngravely laid down as foundations of political theories by eminent\r\nphilosophers. What the time of the Crusades is to us, the generation of\r\nCroesus and Solon was to the Greeks of the time of Herodotus. Babylon\r\n{381}was to them what Pekin was to the French academicians of the last\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nFor such a people was the book of Herodotus composed; and, if we may\r\ntrust to a report, not sanctioned indeed by writers of high authority,\r\nbut in itself not improbable, it was composed, not to be read, but to\r\nbe heard. It was not to the slow circulation of a few copies, which the\r\nrich only could possess, that the aspiring author looked for his reward.\r\nThe great Olympian festival,--the solemnity which collected multitudes,\r\nproud of the Grecian name, from the wildest mountains of Doris, and the\r\nremotest colonies of Italy and Libya,--was to witness his triumph. The\r\ninterest of the narrative, and the beauty of the style, were aided\r\nby the imposing effect of recitation,--by the splendour of the\r\nspectacle,--by the powerful influence of sympathy. A critic who could\r\nhave asked for authorities in the midst of such a scene must have been\r\nof a cold and sceptical nature; and few such critics were there: As was\r\nthe historian, such were the auditors,--inquisitive, credulous, easily\r\nmoved by religious awe or patriotic enthusiasm. They were the very\r\nmen to hear with delight of strange beasts, and birds, and trees,--of\r\ndwarfs, and giants, and cannibals,--of gods, whose very names it was\r\nimpiety to utter,--of ancient dynasties, which had left behind them\r\nmonuments surpassing all the works of later times,--of towns like\r\nprovinces,--of rivers like seas,--of stupendous walls, and temples, and\r\npyramids,--of the rites which the Magi performed at daybreak on the tops\r\nof the mountains,--of the secrets inscribed on the eternal obelisks of\r\nMemphis. With equal delight they would have listened to the\r\ngraceful romances of their own country. They now heard of the exact\r\n{382}accomplishment of obscure predictions, of the punishment of crimes\r\nover which the justice of heaven had seemed to slumber,--of dreams,\r\nomens, warnings from the dead,--of princesses, for whom noble suitors\r\ncontended in every generous exercise of strength and skill,--of infants,\r\nstrangely preserved from the dagger of the assassin, to fulfil high\r\ndestinies.\r\n\r\nAs the narrative approached their own times, the interest became still\r\nmore absorbing. The chronicler had now to tell the story of that\r\ngreat conflict from which Europe dates its intellectual and political\r\nsupremacy,--a story which, even at this distance of time, is the most\r\nmarvellous and the most touching in the annals of the human race,--a\r\nstory abounding with all that is wild and wonderful, with all that is\r\npathetic and animating; with the gigantic caprices of infinite wealth\r\nand despotic power--with the mightier miracles of wisdom, of virtue,\r\nand of courage. He told them of rivers dried up in a day,--of\r\nprovinces famished for a meal,--of a passage for ships hewn through the\r\nmountains,--of a road for armies spread upon the waves,--of monarchies\r\nand commonwealths swept away,--of anxiety, of terror, of confusion, of\r\ndespair!--and then of proud and stubborn hearts tried in that extremity\r\nof evil, and not found wanting,--of resistance long maintained against\r\ndesperate odds,--of lives dearly sold, when resistance could be\r\nmaintained no more,--of signal deliverance, and of unsparing revenge.\r\nWhatever gave a stronger air of reality to a narrative so well\r\ncalculated to inflame the passions, and to flatter national pride, was\r\ncertain to be favourably received.\r\n\r\nBetween the time at which Herodotus is said to have composed his\r\nhistory, and the close of the Peloponnesian {383}war, about forty years\r\nelapsed,--forty years, crowded with great military and political events.\r\nThe circumstances of that period produced a great effect on the\r\nGrecian character; and nowhere was this effect so remarkable as in the\r\nillustrious democracy of Athens. An Athenian, indeed, even in the\r\ntime of Herodotus, would scarcely have written a book so romantic and\r\ngarrulous as that of Herodotus. As civilisation advanced, the citizens\r\nof that famous republic became still less visionary, and still less\r\nsimple-hearted. They aspired to know where their ancestors had been\r\ncontent to doubt; they began to doubt where their ancestors had thought\r\nit their duty to believe. Aristophanes is fond of alluding to this\r\nchange in the temper of his countrymen. The father and son, in the\r\nClouds, are evidently representatives of the generations to which they\r\nrespectively belonged. Nothing more clearly illustrates the nature of\r\nthis moral revolution than the change which passed upon tragedy. The\r\nwild sublimity of Æschylus became the scoff of every young Phidippides.\r\nLectures on abstruse points of philosophy, the fine distinctions of\r\ncasuistry, and the dazzling fence of rhetoric, were substituted for\r\npoetry. The language lost something of that infantine sweetness which\r\nhad characterised it. It became less like the ancient Tuscan, and more\r\nlike the modern French.\r\n\r\nThe fashionable logic of the Greeks, was, indeed, far from strict. Logic\r\nnever can be strict where books are scarce, and where information is\r\nconveyed orally. We are all aware how frequently fallacies, which, when\r\nset down on paper, are at once detected, pass for unanswerable arguments\r\nwhen dexterously and volubly urged in Parliament, at the bar, or in\r\nprivate conversation. The reason is evident. We cannot inspect {384}them\r\nclosely enough to perceive their inaccuracy. We cannot readily compare\r\nthem with each other. We lose sight of one part of the subject before\r\nanother, which ought to be received in connection with it, comes before\r\nus; and, as there is no immutable record of what has been admitted and\r\nof what has been denied, direct contradictions pass muster with little\r\ndifficulty. Almost all the education of a Greek consisted in talking and\r\nlistening. His opinions on government were picked up in the debates of\r\nthe assembly. If he wished to study metaphysics, instead of shutting\r\nhimself up with a book, he walked down to the market-place to look for\r\na sophist. So completely were men formed to these habits, that even\r\nwriting acquired a conversational air. The philosophers adopted the form\r\nof dialogue, as the most natural mode of communicating knowledge. Their\r\nreasonings have the merits and the defects which belong to that species\r\nof composition, and are characterised rather by quickness and subtilty\r\nthan by depth and precision. Truth is exhibited in parts, and by\r\nglimpses. Innumerable clever hints are given; but no sound and durable\r\nsystem is erected. The _argumentum ad hominem_, a kind of argument most\r\nefficacious in debate, but utterly useless for the investigation of\r\ngeneral principles, is among their favourite resources. Hence, though\r\nnothing can be more admirable than the skill which Socrates displays in\r\nthe conversations which Plato has reported or invented, his victories,\r\nfor the most part, seem to us unprofitable. A trophy is set up; but no\r\nnew province is added to the dominions of the human mind.\r\n\r\nStill, where thousands of keen and ready intellects were constantly\r\nemployed in speculating on the qualities {385}of actions and on the\r\nprinciples of government, it was impossible that history should retain\r\nits old character. It became less gossiping and less picturesque; but\r\nmuch more accurate, and somewhat more scientific.\r\n\r\nThe history of Thucydides differs from that of Herodotus as a portrait\r\ndiffers from the representation of an imaginary scene; as the Burke or\r\nFox of Reynolds differs from his Ugolino or his Beaufort. In the\r\nformer ease, the archetype is given: in the latter, it is created. The\r\nfaculties which are required for the latter purpose are of a higher\r\nand rarer order than those which suffice for the former, and indeed\r\nnecessarily comprise them. He who is able to paint what he sees with the\r\neye of the mind will surely be able to paint what he sees with the eye\r\nof the body. He who can invent a story, and tell it well, will also\r\nbe able to tell, in an interesting manner, a story which he has not\r\ninvented. If, in practice, some of the best writers of fiction have been\r\namong the worst writers of history, it has been because one of their\r\ntalents had merged in another so completely that it could not be\r\nsevered; because, having long been habituated to invent and narrate at\r\nthe same time, they found it impossible to narrate without inventing.\r\n\r\nSome capricious and discontented artists have affected to consider\r\nportrait-painting as unworthy of a man of genius. Some critics have\r\nspoken in the same contemptuous manner of history. Johnson puts the case\r\nthus: The historian tells either what is false or what is true: in the\r\nformer case he is no historian: in the latter he has no opportunity for\r\ndisplaying his abilities: for truth is one: and all who tell the truth\r\nmust tell it alike.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to elude both the horns of this {386}dilemma. We\r\nwill recur to the analogous art of portrait-painting. Any man with eyes\r\nand hands may be taught to take a likeness. The process, up to a certain\r\npoint, is merely mechanical. If this were all, a man of talents might\r\njustly despise the occupation. But we could mention portraits which are\r\nresemblances,--but not mere resemblances; faithful,--but much more than\r\nfaithful; portraits which condense into one point of time, and exhibit,\r\nat a single glance, the whole history of turbid and eventful lives--in\r\nwhich the eye seems to scrutinise us, and the mouth to command us--in\r\nwhich the brow menaces, and the lip almost quivers with scorn--in which\r\nevery wrinkle is a comment on some important transaction. The account\r\nwhich Thucydides has given of the retreat from Syracuse is, among\r\nnarratives, what Vandyk’s Lord Strafford is among paintings.\r\n\r\nDiversity, it is said, implies error: truth is one, and admits of no\r\ndegrees. We answer, that this principle holds good only in abstract\r\nreasonings. When we talk of the truth of imitation in the fine arts, we\r\nmean an imperfect and a graduated truth. No picture is exactly like\r\nthe original; nor is a picture good in proportion as it is like the\r\noriginal. When Sir Thomas Lawrence paints a handsome peeress, he does\r\nnot contemplate her through a powerful microscope, and transfer to the\r\ncanvas the pores of the skin, the blood-vessels of the eye, and all the\r\nother beauties which Gulliver discovered in the Brobdignaggian maids\r\nof honour. If he were to do this, the effect would not merely be\r\nunpleasant, but, unless the scale of the picture were proportionably\r\nenlarged, would be absolutely _false_. And, after all, a microscope\r\nof greater power than that which he had employed would convict him of\r\ninnumerable {387}omissions. The same may be said of history. Perfectly\r\nand absolutely true it cannot be: for, to be perfectly and absolutely\r\ntrue, it ought to record _all_ the slightest particulars of the\r\nslightest transactions--all the things done and all the words uttered\r\nduring the time of which it treats. The omission of any circumstance,\r\nhowever insignificant, would be a defect. If history were written thus,\r\nthe Bodleian library would not contain the occurrences of a week. What\r\nis told in the fullest and most accurate annals bears an infinitely\r\nsmall proportion to what is suppressed. The difference between the\r\ncopious work of Clarendon and the account of the civil wars in the\r\nabridgment of Goldsmith vanishes when compared with the immense mass of\r\nfacts respecting which both are equally silent.\r\n\r\nNo picture, then, and no history, can present us with the whole truth:\r\nbut those are the best pictures and the best histories which exhibit\r\nsuch parts of the truth as most nearly produce the effect of the whole.\r\nHe who is deficient in the art of selection may, by showing nothing\r\nbut the truth, produce all the effect of the grossest falsehood. It\r\nperpetually happens that one writer tells less truth than another,\r\nmerely because he tells more truths. In the imitative arts we constantly\r\nsee this. There are lines in the human face, and objects in landscape,\r\nwhich stand in such relations to each other, that they ought either to\r\nbe all introduced into a painting together or all omitted together. A\r\nsketch into which none of them enters may be excellent; but, if some\r\nare given and others left out, though there are more points of likeness,\r\nthere is less likeness. An outline scrawled with a pen, which seizes the\r\nmarked features of a countenance, will give a much stronger idea of it\r\nthan a bad painting in oils. Yet {388}the worst painting in oils\r\nthat ever hung at Somerset House resembles the original in many more\r\nparticulars. A bust of white marble may give an excellent idea of a\r\nblooming face. Colour the lips and cheeks of the bust, leaving the hair\r\nand eyes unaltered, and the similarity, instead of being; more striking,\r\nwill be less so.\r\n\r\nHistory has its foreground and its background: and it is principally in\r\nthe management of its perspective that one artist differs from another.\r\nSome events must be represented on a large scale, others diminished; the\r\ngreat majority will be lost in the dimness of the horizon; and a general\r\nidea of their joint effect will be given by a few slight touches.\r\n\r\nIn this respect no writer has ever equalled Thucydides. He was a perfect\r\nmaster of the art of gradual diminution. His history is sometimes as\r\nconcise as a chronological chart; yet it is always perspicuous. It\r\nis sometimes as minute as one of Lovelace’s letters; yet it is never\r\nprolix. He never fails to contract and to expand it in the right place.\r\n\r\nThucydides borrowed from Herodotus the practice of putting speeches of\r\nhis own into the mouths of his characters. In Herodotus this usage is\r\nscarcely censurable. It is of a piece with his whole manner. But it is\r\naltogether incongruous in the work of his successor, and violates, not\r\nonly the accuracy of history, but the decencies of fiction. When once\r\nwe enter into the spirit of Herodotus, we find no inconsistency. The\r\nconventional probability of his drama is preserved from the beginning\r\nto the end. The deliberate orations, and the familiar dialogues are\r\nin strict keeping with each other. But the speeches of Thucydides are\r\nneither preceded nor followed by anything with which they harmonise.\r\nThey give to the whole book something {389}of the grotesque character of\r\nthose Chinese pleasure-grounds in which perpendicular rocks of granite\r\nstart up in the midst of a soft green plain. Invention is shocking where\r\ntruth is in such close juxtaposition with it.\r\n\r\nThucydides honestly tells us that some of these discourses are purely\r\nfictitious. He may have reported the substance of others correctly. But\r\nit is clear from the internal evidence that he has preserved no more\r\nthan the substance. His own peculiar habits of thought and expression\r\nare everywhere discernible. Individual and national peculiarities are\r\nseldom to be traced in the sentiments, and never in the diction. The\r\noratory of the Corinthians and Thebans is not less Attic, either in\r\nmatter or in manner, than that of the Athenians. The style of Cleon is\r\nas pure, as austere, as terse, and as significant, as that of Pericles.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this great fault, it must be allowed that Thucydides has\r\nsurpassed all his rivals in the art of historical narration, in the\r\nart of producing an effect on the imagination, by skilful selection\r\nand disposition, without indulging in the license of invention. But\r\nnarration, though an important part of the business of a historian, is\r\nnot the whole. To append a moral to a work of fiction is either useless\r\nor superfluous. A fiction may give a more impressive effect to what\r\nis already known; but it can teach nothing new. If it presents to us\r\ncharacters and trains of events to which our experience furnishes\r\nus with nothing similar, instead of deriving instruction from it, we\r\npronounce it unnatural. We do not form our opinions from it; but we\r\ntry it by our preconceived opinions. Fiction, therefore, is essentially\r\nimitative. Its merit consists in its resemblance to a model with which\r\nwe are al ready {390}familiar, or to which at least we can instantly\r\nrefer. Hence it is that the anecdotes which interest us most strongly in\r\nauthentic narrative are offensive when introduced into novels; that what\r\nis called the romantic part of history is in fact the least romantic. It\r\nis delightful as history, because it contradicts our previous notions\r\nof human nature, and of the connection of causes and effects. It is, on\r\nthat very account, shocking and incongruous in fiction. In fiction,\r\nthe principles are given, to find the facts: in history, the facts are\r\ngiven, to find the principles; and the writer who does not explain the\r\nphenomena as well as state them performs only one half of his office.\r\nFacts are the mere dross of history. It is from the abstract truth which\r\ninterpenetrates them, and lies latent among them like gold in the ore,\r\nthat the mass derives its whole value: and the precious particles are\r\ngenerally combined with the baser in such a manner that the separation\r\nis a task of the utmost difficulty.\r\n\r\nHere Thucydides is deficient: the deficiency, indeed, is not\r\ndiscreditable to him. It was the inevitable effect of circumstances. It\r\nwas in the nature of things necessary that, in some part of its progress\r\nthrough political science, the human mind should reach that point which\r\nit attained in his time. Knowledge advances by steps, and not by leaps.\r\nThe axioms of an English debating club would have been startling and\r\nmysterious paradoxes to the most enlightened statesmen of Athens. But\r\nit would be as absurd to speak contemptuously of the Athenian on this\r\naccount as to ridicule Strabo for not having given us an account of\r\nChili, or to talk of Ptolemy as we talk of Sir Richard Phillips. Still,\r\nwhen we wish for solid geographical information, we must prefer the\r\nsolemn coxcombry of {391}Pinkerton to the noble work of Strabo. If we\r\nwanted instruction respecting the solar system, we should consult the\r\nsilliest girl from a boarding school, rather than Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nThucydides was undoubtedly a sagacious and reflecting man. This clearly\r\nappears from the ability with which he discusses practical questions.\r\nBut the talent of deciding on the circumstances of a particular case is\r\noften possessed in the highest perfection by persons destitute of\r\nthe power of generalisation. Men skilled in the military tactics\r\nof civilised nations have been amazed at the far-sightedness and\r\npenetration which a Mohawk displays in concerting his stratagems, or in\r\ndiscerning those of his enemies. In England, no class possesses so much\r\nof that peculiar ability which is required for constructing ingenious\r\nschemes, and for obviating remote difficulties, as the thieves and the\r\nthief-takers. Women have more of this dexterity than men. Lawyers have\r\nmore of it than statesmen: statesmen have more of it than philosophers.\r\nMonk had more of it than Harrington and all his club. Walpole had more\r\nof it than Adam Smith or Beccaria. Indeed, the species of discipline\r\nby which this dexterity is acquired tends to contract the mind, and to\r\nrender it incapable of abstract reasoning.\r\n\r\nThe Grecian statesmen of the age of Thucydides were distinguished by\r\ntheir practical sagacity, their insight into motives, their skill in\r\ndevising means for the attainment of their ends. A state of society in\r\nwinch the rich were constantly planning the oppression of the poor,\r\nand the poor the spoliation of the rich, in which the ties of party\r\nhad superseded those of country, in which revolutions and counter\r\nrevolutions were events of daily occurrence, was naturally prolific\r\n{392}in desperate and crafty political adventurers. This was the very\r\nschool in which men were likely to acquire the dissimulation of Mazarin,\r\nthe judicious temerity of Richelieu, the penetration, the exquisite\r\ntact, the almost instinctive presentiment of approaching events which\r\ngave so much authority to the counsel of Shaftesbury that “it was as\r\nif a man had inquired of the oracle of God.” In this school Thucydides\r\nstudied; and his wisdom is that which such a school would naturally\r\nafford. He judges better of circumstances than of principles. The more\r\na question is narrowed, the better he reasons upon it. His work suggests\r\nmany most important considerations respecting the first principles\r\nof government and morals, the growth of factions, the organisation of\r\narmies, and the mutual relations of communities. Yet all his general\r\nobservations on these subjects are very superficial. His most judicious\r\nremarks differ from the remarks of a really philosophical historian,\r\nas a sum correctly cast up by a book-keeper from a general expression\r\ndiscovered by an algebraist. The former is useful only in a single\r\ntransaction; the latter may be applied to an infinite number of cases.\r\n\r\nThis opinion will, we fear, be considered as heterodox. For, not to\r\nspeak of the illusion which the sight of a Greek type, or the sound of\r\na Greek dip-thong, often produces, there are some peculiarities in the\r\nmanner of Thucydides which in no small degree have tended to secure to\r\nhim the reputation of profundity. His book is evidently the book of a\r\nman and a statesman; and in this respect presents a remarkable contrast\r\nto the delightful childishness of Herodotus. Throughout it there is\r\nan air of matured power, of grave and melancholy reflection, of\r\nimpartiality and {393}habitual self-command. His feelings are rarely\r\nindulged, and speedily repressed. Vulgar prejudices of every kind,\r\nand particularly vulgar superstitions, he treats with a cold and\r\nsober disdain peculiar to himself. His style is weighty, condensed,\r\nantithetical, and not unfrequently obscure. But, when we look at his\r\npolitical philosophy, without regard to these circumstances, we find\r\nhim to have been, what indeed it would have been a miracle if he had not\r\nbeen, simply an Athenian of the fifth century before Christ.\r\n\r\nXenophon is commonly placed, but we think without much reason, in the\r\nsame rank with Herodotus and Thucydides. He resembles them, indeed,\r\nin the purity and sweetness of his style; but, in spirit, he rather\r\nresembles that later school of historians, whose works seem to be fables\r\ncomposed for a moral, and who, In their eagerness to give us warnings\r\nand examples, forget to give us men and women. The Life of Cyrus,\r\nwhether we look upon it as a history or as a romance, seems to us a\r\nvery wretched performance. The expedition of the Ten Thousand, and the\r\nHistory of Grecian Affairs, are certainly pleasant reading; but they\r\nindicate no great power of mind. In truth, Xenophon, though his taste\r\nwas elegant, his disposition amiable, and his intercourse with the world\r\nextensive, had, we suspect, rather a weak head. Such was evidently the\r\nopinion of that extraordinary man to whom he early attached himself,\r\nand for whose memory he entertained an idolatrous veneration. He came in\r\nonly for the milk with which Socrates nourished his babes in philosophy.\r\nA few saws of morality, and a few of the simplest doctrines of natural\r\nreligion, were enough for the good young man. The strong meat, the bold\r\nspeculations on physical and metaphysical science, were {394}reserved\r\nfor auditors of a different description. Even the lawless habits of\r\na captain of mercenary troops could not change the tendency which the\r\ncharacter of Xenophon early acquired. To the last, he seems to have\r\nretained a sort of heathen Puritanism. The sentiments of piety and\r\nvirtue which abound in his works are those of a well-meaning man,\r\nsomewhat timid and narrow-minded, devout from constitution rather than\r\nfrom rational conviction. He was as superstitious as Herodotus, but in\r\na way far more offensive. The very peculiarities which charm us in\r\nan infant, the toothless mumbling, the stammering, the tottering, the\r\nhelplessness, the causeless tears and laughter, are disgusting in\r\nold age. In the same manner, the absurdity which precedes a period\r\nof general intelligence is often pleasing; that which follows it is\r\ncontemptible. The nonsense of Herodotus is that of a baby. The nonsense\r\nof Xenophon is that of a dotard. His stories about dreams, omens, and\r\nprophecies, present a strange contrast to the passages in which the\r\nshrewd and incredulous Thucydides mentions the popular superstitions.\r\nIt is not quite clear that Xenophon was honest in his credulity;’ his\r\nfanaticism was in some degree politic. He would have made an excellent\r\nmember of the Apostolic Camarilla. An alarmist by nature, an aristocrat\r\nby party, he carried to an unreasonable excess his horror of popular\r\nturbulence. The quiet atrocity of Sparta did not shock him in the same\r\nmanner; for he hated tumult more than crimes. He was desirous to find\r\nrestraints which might curb the passions of the multitude; and he\r\nabsurdly fancied that he had found them in a religion without\r\nevidences or sanction, precepts or example, in a frigid system of\r\nrheophilanthropy, supported by nursery tales. {395}Polybius and Arrian\r\nhave given us authentic accounts of facts; and here their merit ends.\r\nThey were not men of comprehensive minds; they had not the art of\r\ntelling a story in an interesting manner. They have in consequence been\r\nthrown into the shade by writers who, though less studious of truth than\r\nthemselves, understood far better the art of producing effect,--by Livy\r\nand Quintus Curtius.\r\n\r\nYet Polybius and Arrian deserve high praise when compared with the\r\nwriters of that school of which Plutarch may be considered as the head.\r\nFor the historians of this class we must confess that we entertain a\r\npeculiar aversion. They seem to have been pedants, who, though destitute\r\nof those valuable qualities which are frequently found in conjunction\r\nwith pedantry, thought themselves great philosophers and great\r\npoliticians. They not only mislead their readers in every page, as to\r\nparticular facts, but they appear to have altogether misconceived the\r\nwhole character of the times of which they write. They were inhabitants\r\nof an empire bounded by the Atlantic Ocean and the Euphrates, by the\r\nice of Scythia and the sands of Mauritania; composed of nations whose\r\nmanners, whose languages, whose religion, whose countenances and\r\ncomplexions, were widely different; governed by one mighty despotism,\r\nwhich had risen on the ruins of a thousand commonwealths and kingdoms.\r\nOf liberty, such as it is in small democracies, of patriotism, such as\r\nit is in small independent communities of any kind, they had, and they\r\ncould have, no experimental knowledge. But they had read of men who\r\nexerted themselves in the cause of their country with an energy unknown\r\nin later times, who had violated the dearest of domestic charities, or\r\nvoluntarily devoted themselves to death, {396}for the public good;\r\nand they wondered at the degeneracy of their contemporaries. It never\r\noccurred to them that the feelings which they so greatly admired\r\nsprung from local and occasional causes; that they will always grow up\r\nspontaneously in small societies; and that, in large empires, though\r\nthey may be forced into existence for a short time by peculiar\r\ncircumstances, they cannot be general or permanent. It is impossible\r\nthat any man should feel for a fortress on a remote frontier as he\r\nfeels for his own house; that he should grieve for a defeat in which ten\r\nthousand people whom he never saw have fallen as he grieves for a defeat\r\nwhich has half unpeopled the street in which he lives; that he should\r\nleave his home for a military expedition in order to preserve the\r\nbalance of power, as cheerfully as he would leave it to repel invaders\r\nwho had begun to burn all the corn fields in his neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe writers of whom we speak should have considered this. They should\r\nhave considered that in patriotism, such as it existed amongst the\r\nGreeks, there was nothing essentially and eternally good; that an\r\nexclusive attachment to a particular society, though a natural,\r\nand, under certain restrictions, a most useful sentiment, implies\r\nno extraordinary attainments in wisdom or virtue; that, where it has\r\nexisted in an intense degree, it has turned states into gangs of robbers\r\nwhom their mutual fidelity has rendered more dangerous, has given a\r\ncharacter of peculiar atrocity to war, and has generated that worst of\r\nall political evils, the tyranny of nations over nations.\r\n\r\nEnthusiastically attached to the name of liberty, these historians\r\ntroubled themselves little about its definition. The Spartans, tormented\r\nby ten thousand absurd restraints, unable to please themselves in the\r\n{397}choice of their wives, their suppers, or their company, compelled\r\nto assume a peculiar manner, and to talk in a peculiar style, gloried\r\nin their liberty. The aristocracy of Rome repeatedly made liberty a plea\r\nfor cutting off the favourites of the people. In almost all the little\r\ncommonwealths of antiquity, liberty was used as a pretext for measures\r\ndirected against everything which makes liberty valuable, for measures\r\nwhich stifled discussion, corrupted the administration of justice, and\r\ndiscouraged the accumulation of property. The writers, whose works we\r\nare considering, confounded the sound with the substance, and the\r\nmeans with the end. Their imaginations were inflamed by mystery. They\r\nconceived of liberty as monks conceive of love, as cockneys conceive of\r\nthe happiness and innocence of rural life, as novel-reading sempstresses\r\nconceive of Almack’s and Grosvenor Square, accomplished Marquesses and\r\nhandsome Colonels of the Guards. In the relation of events, and the\r\ndelineation of characters, they have paid little attention to facts,\r\nto the costume of the times of which they pretend to treat, or to the\r\ngeneral principles of human nature. They have been faithful only to\r\ntheir own puerile and extravagant doctrines. Generals and statesmen are\r\nmetamorphosed into magnanimous coxcombs, from whose fulsome virtues we\r\nturn away with disgust. The fine sayings and exploits of their heroes\r\nremind us of the insufferable perfections of Sir Charles Grandison, and\r\naffect us with a nausea similar to that which we feel when an actor,\r\nin one of Morton’s or Kotzebue’s plays, lays his hand on his heart,\r\nadvances to the ground-lights, and mouths a moral sentence for the\r\nedification of the gods.\r\n\r\nThese writers, men who knew not what it was to have a country, men\r\nwho had never enjoyed political {398}rights, brought into fashion an\r\noffensive cant about patriotism and zeal for freedom. What the English\r\nPuritans did for the language of Christianity, what Scuderi did for\r\nthe language of love, they did for the language of public spirit. By\r\nhabitual exaggeration they made it mean. By monotonous emphasis they\r\nmade it feeble. They abused it till it became scarcely possible to use\r\nit with effect.\r\n\r\nTheir ordinary rules of morality are deduced from extreme cases. The\r\ncommon regimen which they prescribe for society is made up of those\r\ndesperate remedies which only its most desperate distempers require.\r\nThey look with peculiar complacency on actions which even those\r\nwho approve them consider as exceptions to laws of almost universal\r\napplication--which bear so close an affinity to the most atrocious\r\ncrimes that, even where it may be unjust to censure them, it is unsafe\r\nto praise them. It is not strange, therefore, that some flagitious\r\ninstances of perfidy and cruelty should have been passed unchallenged in\r\nsuch company, that grave moralists, with no personal interest at stake,\r\nshould have extolled, in the highest terms, deeds of which the\r\natrocity appalled even the infuriated factions in whose cause they were\r\nperpetrated. The part which Timoleon took in the assassination of his\r\nbrother shocked many of his own partisans. The recollection of it preyed\r\nlong on his own mind. But it was reserved for historians who lived some\r\ncenturies later to discover that his conduct was a glorious display of\r\nvirtue, and to lament that, from the frailty of human nature, a man who\r\ncould perform so great an exploit could repent of it.\r\n\r\nThe writings of these men, and of their modern imitators, have produced\r\neffects which deserve some notice. {399}The English have been so long\r\naccustomed to political speculation, and have enjoyed so large a measure\r\nof practical liberty, that such works have produced little effect on\r\ntheir minds. We have classical associations and great names of our own\r\nwhich we can confidently oppose to the most splendid of ancient times.\r\nSenate has not to our ears a sound so venerable as Parliament. We\r\nrespect the Great Charter more than the laws of Solon. The Capitol and\r\nthe Forum impress us with less awe than our own Westminster Hall and\r\nWestminster Abbey, the place where the great men of twenty generations\r\nhave contended, the place where they sleep together! The list of\r\nwarriors and statesmen by whom our constitution was founded or\r\npreserved, from De Montfort down to Fox, may well stand a comparison\r\nwith the Fasti of Rome. The dying thanksgiving of Sydney is as noble as\r\nthe libation which Thrasea poured to Liberating Jove: and we think\r\nwith far less pleasure of Cato tearing out his entrails than of Russell\r\nsaying, as he turned away from his wife, that the bitterness of death\r\nwas past. Even those parts of our history over which, on some accounts,\r\nwe would gladly throw a veil may be proudly opposed to those on which\r\nthe moralists of antiquity loved most to dwell. The enemy of English\r\nliberty was not murdered by men whom he had pardoned and loaded with\r\nbenefits. He was not stabbed in the back by those who smiled and cringed\r\nbefore his face. He was vanquished on fields of stricken battle; he was\r\narraigned, sentenced, and executed in the face of heaven and earth. Our\r\nliberty is neither Greek nor Roman; but essentially English. It has\r\na character of its own,--a character which has taken a tinge from the\r\nsentiments of the chivalrous ages, and which accords with {400}the\r\npeculiarities of our manners and of our insular situation. It has a\r\nlanguage, too, of its own, and a language singularly idiomatic, full of\r\nmeaning to ourselves, scarcely intelligible to strangers.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, the effect of books such as those which we have been\r\nconsidering has been harmless. They have, indeed, given currency to\r\nmany very erroneous opinions with respect to ancient history. They\r\nhave heated the imaginations of boys. They have misled the judgment and\r\ncorrupted the taste of some men of letters, such as Akenside and Sir\r\nWilliam Jones. But on persons engaged in public affairs they have had\r\nvery little influence. The foundations of our constitution were laid\r\nby men who knew nothing of the Greeks but that they denied the orthodox\r\nprocession and cheated the Crusaders; and nothing of Rome, but that\r\nthe Pope lived there. Those who followed, contented themselves with\r\nimproving on the original plan. They found models at home; and therefore\r\nthey did not look for them abroad. But, when enlightened men on the\r\nContinent began to think about political reformation, having no patterns\r\nbefore their eyes in their domestic history, they naturally had\r\nrecourse to those remains of antiquity, the study of which is considered\r\nthroughout Europe as an important part of education. The historians of\r\nwhom we have been speaking had been members of large communities, and\r\nsubjects of absolute sovereigns. Hence it is, as we have already said,\r\nthat they commit such gross errors in speaking of the little republics\r\nof antiquity. Their works were now read in the spirit in which they\r\nhad been written. They were read by men placed in circumstances closely\r\nresembling their own, unacquainted with the real nature of liberty, but\r\n{401}inclined to believe everything good which could be told respecting\r\nit. How powerfully these books impressed these speculative reformers, is\r\nwell known to all who have paid any attention to the French literature\r\nof the last century. But, perhaps, the writer on whom they produced the\r\ngreatest effect was Vittorio Alfieri. In some of his plays, particularly\r\nin Virginia, Timoleon, and Brutus the Younger, he has even caricatured\r\nthe extravagance of his masters.\r\n\r\nIt was not strange that the blind, thus led by the blind, should\r\nstumble. The transactions of the French Revolution, in some measure,\r\ntook their character from these works. Without the assistance of these\r\nworks, indeed, a revolution would have taken place,--a revolution\r\nproductive of much good and much evil, tremendous but shortlived, evil\r\ndearly purchased, but durable good. But it would not have been exactly\r\nsuch a revolution. The style, the accessories, would have been in many\r\nrespects different. There would have been less of bombast in language,\r\nless of affectation in manner, less of solemn trifling and ostentatious\r\nsimplicity. The acts of legislative assemblies, and the correspondence\r\nof diplomatists, would not have been disgraced by rants worthy only of a\r\ncollege declamation. The government of a great and polished nation would\r\nnot have rendered itself ridiculous by attempting to revive the usages\r\nof a world which had long passed away, or rather of a world which\r\nhad never existed except in the description of a fantastic school of\r\nwriters. These second-hand imitations resembled the originals about as\r\nmuch as the classical feast with which the Doctor in Peregrine Pickle\r\nturned the stomachs of all his guests resembled one of the suppers of\r\nLucullus in the Hall of Apollo. {402}These were mere follies. But the\r\nspirit excited by these writers produced more serious effects. The\r\ngreater part of the crimes which disgraced the revolution sprung indeed\r\nfrom the relaxation of law, from popular ignorance, from the remembrance\r\nof past oppression, from the fear of foreign conquest, from rapacity,\r\nfrom ambition, from party-spirit. But many atrocious proceedings must,\r\ndoubtless, be ascribed to heated imagination, to perverted principle,\r\nto a distaste for what was vulgar in morals, and a passion for what was\r\nstartling and dubious. Mr. Burke has touched on this subject with great\r\nfelicity of expression: “The gradation of their republic,” says he, “is\r\nlaid in moral paradoxes. All those instances to be found in history,\r\nwhether real or fabulous, of a doubtful public spirit, at which morality\r\nis perplexed, reason is staggered, and from which affrighted nature\r\nrecoils, are their chosen and almost sole examples for the instruction\r\nof their youth.” This evil, we believe, is to be directly ascribed to\r\nthe influence of the historians whom we have mentioned, and their modern\r\nimitators.\r\n\r\nLivy had some faults in common with these writers. But on the whole he\r\nmust be considered as forming a class by himself: no historian with whom\r\nwe are acquainted has shown so complete an indifference to truth. He\r\nseems to have cared only about the picturesque effect of his book, and\r\nthe honour of his country. On the other hand, we do not know, in the\r\nwhole range of literature, an instance of a bad thing so well done. The\r\npainting of the narrative is beyond description vivid and graceful. The\r\nabundance of interesting sentiments and splendid imagery in the speeches\r\nis almost miraculous. His mind is a soil which is never overturned, a\r\nfountain which never seems to trickle. {403}It pours forth profusely;\r\nyet it gives no sign of exhaustion. It was probably to this exuberance\r\nof thought and language, always fresh, always sweet, always pure, no\r\nsooner yielded than repaired, that the critics applied that expression\r\nwhich has been so much discussed, _lactea ubertas_.\r\n\r\nAll the merits and all the defects of Livy take a colouring from the\r\ncharacter of his nation. He was a writer peculiarly Roman; the proud\r\ncitizen of a commonwealth which had indeed lost the reality of liberty,\r\nbut which still sacredly preserved its forms--in fact the subject of an\r\narbitrary prince, but in his own estimation one of the masters of the\r\nworld, with a hundred kings below him, and only the gods above him. He,\r\ntherefore, looked back on former times with feelings far different from\r\nthose which were naturally entertained by his Greek contemporaries, and\r\nwhich at a later period became general among men of letters throughout\r\nthe Roman Empire. He contemplated the past with interest and delight,\r\nnot because it furnished a contrast to the present, but because it\r\nhad led to the present. He recurred to it, not to lose in proud\r\nrecollections the sense of national degradation, but to trace the\r\nprogress of national glory. It is true that his veneration for antiquity\r\nproduced on him some of the effects which it produced on those who\r\narrived at it by a very different road. He has something of their\r\nexaggeration, something of their cant, something of their fondness for\r\nanomalies and _lusus naturo_ in morality. Yet even here we perceive\r\na difference. They talk rapturously of patriotism and liberty in the\r\nabstract. He does not seem to think any country but Rome deserving of\r\nlove: nor is it for liberty as liberty, but for liberty as a part of the\r\nRoman institutions, that he is zealous. {404}Of the concise and elegant\r\naccounts of the campaigns of Caesar little can be said. They are\r\nincomparable models for military despatches. But histories they are not,\r\nand do not pretend to be.\r\n\r\nThe ancient critics placed Sallust in the same rank with Livy; and\r\nunquestionably the small portion of his works which has come down to us\r\nis calculated to give a high opinion of his talents. But his style\r\nis not very pleasant: and his most powerful work, the account of the\r\nConspiracy of Catiline, has rather the air of a clever party pamphlet\r\nthan that of a history. It abounds with strange inconsistencies, which,\r\nunexplained as they are, necessarily excite doubts as to the fairness\r\nof the narrative. It is true, that many circumstances now forgotten may\r\nhave been familiar to his contemporaries, and may have rendered passages\r\nclear to them which to us appear dubious and perplexing. But a great\r\nhistorian should remember that he writes for distant generations, for\r\nmen who will perceive the apparent contradictions, and will possess no\r\nmeans of reconciling them. We can only vindicate the fidelity of Sallust\r\nat the expense of his skill. But in fact all the information which we\r\nhave from contemporaries respecting this famous plot is liable to the\r\nsame objection, and is read by discerning men with the same incredulity.\r\nIt is all on one side. No answer has reached our times. Yet, on the\r\nshowing of the accusers, the accused seem entitled to acquittal.\r\nCatiline, we are told, intrigued with a Vestal virgin, and murdered his\r\nown son. His house was a den of gamblers and debauchees. No young man\r\ncould cross his threshold without danger to his fortune and reputation.\r\nYet this is the man with whom Cicero was willing to coalesce in a\r\ncontest for the first magistracy of the republic; {405}and whom he\r\ndescribed, long after the fatal termination of the conspiracy, as an\r\naccomplished hypocrite, by whom he had himself been deceived, and who\r\nhad acted with consummate skill the character of a good citizen and a\r\ngood friend. We are told that the plot was the most wicked and desperate\r\never known, and, almost in the same breath, that the great body of the\r\npeople, and many of the nobles, favoured it; that the richest citizens\r\nof Rome were eager for the spoliation of all property, and its highest\r\nfunctionaries for the destruction of all order; that Crassus, Cæsar,\r\nthe Praetor Lentulus, one of the consuls of the year, one of the consuls\r\nelect, were proved or suspected to be engaged in a scheme for subverting\r\ninstitutions to which they owed the highest honours, and introducing\r\nuniversal anarchy. We are told that a government, which knew all this,\r\nsuffered the conspirator, whose rank, talents, and courage, rendered\r\nhim most dangerous, to quit Rome without molestation. We are told that\r\nbondmen and gladiators were to be armed against the citizens. Yet we\r\nfind that Catiline rejected the slaves who crowded to enlist in his\r\narmy, lest, as Sallust himself expresses it, “he should seem to identify\r\ntheir cause until that of the citizens.” Finally, we are told that the\r\nmagistrate, who was universally allowed to have saved all classes of\r\nhis countrymen from conflagration and massacre, rendered himself so\r\nunpopular by his conduct that a marked insult was offered to him at\r\nthe expiration of his office, and a severe punishment inflicted on him\r\nshortly after.\r\n\r\nSallust tells us, what, indeed, the letters and speeches of Cicero\r\nsufficiently prove, that some persons considered the shocking and\r\natrocious part of the plot as mere inventions of the government,\r\ndesigned to excuse {406}its unconstitutional measures. We must confess\r\nourselves to be of that opinion. There was, undoubtedly, a strong party\r\ndesirous to change the administration. While Pompey held the command of\r\nan army, they could not effect their purpose without preparing means for\r\nrepelling force, if necessary, by force. In all this there is nothing\r\ndifferent from the ordinary practice of Roman factions. The other\r\ncharges brought against the conspirators are so inconsistent and\r\nimprobable, that we give no credit whatever to them. If our readers think\r\nthis scepticism unreasonable, let them turn to the contemporary accounts\r\nof the Popish plot. Let them look over the votes of Parliament, and the\r\nspeeches of the king; the charges of Scroggs, and the harangues of\r\nthe managers employed against Strafford. A person who should form his\r\njudgment from these pieces alone would believe that London was set on\r\nfire by the Papists, and that Sir Edmondbury Godfrey was murdered for\r\nhis religion. Yet these stories are now altogether exploded. They have\r\nbeen abandoned by statesmen to aldermen, by aldermen to clergymen, by\r\nclergymen to old women, and by old women to Sir Harcourt Lees.\r\n\r\nOf the Latin historians, Tacitus was certainly the greatest. His\r\nstyle, indeed, is not only faulty in itself, but is, in some respects,\r\npeculiarly unfit for historical composition. He carries his love of\r\neffect far beyond the limits of moderation. He tells a fine story\r\nfinely: but he cannot tell a plain story plainly. He stimulates till\r\nstimulants lose their power. Thucydides, as we have already observed,\r\nrelates ordinary transactions with the unpretending clearness and\r\nsuccinctness of a gazette. His great powers of painting he reserves\r\nfor events of which the slightest details are interesting. {407}The\r\nsimplicity of the setting gives additional lustre to the brilliants.\r\nThere are passages in the narrative of Tacitus superior to the best\r\nwhich can be quoted from Thucydides. But they are not enchased and\r\nrelieved with the same skill. They are far more striking when extracted\r\nfrom the body of the work to which they belong than when they occur in\r\ntheir place, and are read in connection with what precedes and follows.\r\n\r\nIn the delineation of character, Tacitus is unrivalled among historians,\r\nand has very few superiors among dramatists and novelists. By the\r\ndelineation of character, we do not mean the practice of drawing up\r\nepigrammatic catalogues of good and had qualities, and appending them\r\nto the names of eminent men. No writer, indeed, has done this more\r\nskilfully than Tacitus; but this is not his peculiar glory. All the\r\npersons who occupy a large space in his works have an individuality of\r\ncharacter which seems to pervade all their words and actions. We know\r\nthem as if we had lived with them. Claudius, Nero, Otho, both the\r\nAgrippinas, are master-pieces. But Tiberius is a still higher miracle of\r\nart. The historian undertook to make us intimately acquainted with a man\r\nsingularly dark and inscrutable,--with a man whose real disposition long\r\nremained swathed up in intricate folds of factitious virtues, and over\r\nwhose actions the hypocrisy of his youth, and the seclusion of his old\r\nage, threw a singular my story. He was to exhibit the specious qualities\r\nof the tyrant in a light which might render them transparent, and enable\r\nus at once to perceive the covering and the vices which it concealed. He\r\nwas to trace the gradations by which the first magistrate of a republic,\r\na senator mingling freely in debate, a noble associating with his\r\nbrother nobles, was transformed into an {408}Asiatic sultan; he was\r\nto exhibit a character, distinguished by courage, self-command, and\r\nprofound policy, yet defiled by all\r\n\r\n                             “th’ extravagancy\r\n\r\n                   And crazy ribaldry of fancy.\"\r\n\r\nHe was to mark the gradual effect of advancing age and approaching death\r\non this strange compound of strength and weakness; to exhibit the old\r\nsovereign of the world sinking into a dotage which, though it rendered\r\nhis appetites eccentric, and his temper savage, never impaired the\r\npowers of his stern and penetrating mind--conscious of failing strength,\r\nraging with capricious sensuality, yet to the last the keenest of\r\nobservers, the most artful of dissemblers, and the most terrible of\r\nmasters. The task was one of extreme difficulty. The execution is almost\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nThe talent which is required to write history thus bears a considerable\r\naffinity to the talent of a great dramatist. There is one obvious\r\ndistinction. The dramatist creates; the historian only disposes.\r\nThe difference is not in the mode of execution, but in the mode of\r\nconception.. Shakspeare is guided by a model which exists in his\r\nimagination; Tacitus, by a model furnished from without. Hamlet is to\r\nTiberius what the Laocoon is to the Newton of Roubilliac.\r\n\r\nIn this part of his art Tacitus certainly had neither equal nor second\r\namong the ancient historians. Herodotus, though he wrote in a dramatic\r\nform, had little of dramatic genius. The frequent dialogues which he\r\nintroduces give vivacity and movement to the narrative, but are not\r\nstrikingly characteristic. Xenophon is fond of telling his readers, at\r\nconsiderable length, what he thought of the persons whose adventures\r\nhe relates. But he does not show them the men, and {409}enable them to\r\njudge for themselves. The heroes of Livy are the most insipid of all\r\nbeings, real or imaginary, the heroes of Plutarch always excepted.\r\nIndeed, the manner of Plutarch in this respect reminds us of the cookery\r\nof those continental inns, the horror of English travellers, in which\r\na certain nondescript broth is kept constantly boiling, and copiously\r\npoured, without distinction, over every dish as it comes up to table.\r\nThucydides, though at a wide interval, comes next to Tacitus.\r\nHis Pericles, his Nieias, his Cleon, his Brasidas, are happily\r\ndiscriminated. The lines are few, the colouring faint; but the general\r\nair and expression is caught.\r\n\r\nWe begin, like the priest in Don Quixote’s library, to be tired with\r\ntaking down books one after another for separate judgment, and feel\r\ninclined to pass sentence on them in masses. We shall therefore,\r\ninstead of pointing out the defects and merits of the different modern\r\nhistorians, state generally in what particulars they have surpassed\r\ntheir predecessors, and in what we conceive them to have failed.\r\n\r\nThey have certainly been, in one sense, far more strict in their\r\nadherence to truth than most of the Greek and Roman writers. They do\r\nnot think themselves entitled to render their narrative interesting by\r\nintroducing descriptions, conversations, and harangues which have no\r\nexistence but in their own imagination. This improvement was gradually\r\nintroduced. History commenced among the modern nations of Europe, as it\r\nhad commenced among the Greeks, in romance. Froissart was our Herodotus.\r\nItaly was to Europe what Athens was to Greece. In Italy, therefore,\r\na more accurate and manly mode of narration was early introduced.\r\nMachiavelli and Guicciardini, in imitation {410}of Livy and Thucydides,\r\ncomposed speeches for their historical personages. But, as the classical\r\nenthusiasm which distinguished the age of Lorenzo and Leo gradually\r\nsubsided, this absurd practice was abandoned. In France, we fear, it\r\nstill, In some degree, keeps its ground. In our own country, a writer\r\nwho should venture on it would be laughed to scorn. Whether the\r\nhistorians of the last two centuries tell more truth than those of\r\nantiquity, may perhaps be doubted. But it is quite certain that they\r\ntell fewer falsehoods.\r\n\r\nIn the philosophy of history, the moderns have very far surpassed the\r\nancients. It is not, indeed, strange that the Greeks and Romans should\r\nnot have carried the science of government, or any other experimental\r\nscience, so far as it has been carried in our time; for the experimental\r\nsciences are generally in a state of progression. They were better\r\nunderstood in the seventeenth century than in the sixteenth, and in\r\nthe eighteenth century than in the seventeenth. But this constant\r\nimprovement, this natural growth of knowledge, will not altogether\r\naccount for the immense superiority of the modern writers. The\r\ndifference is a difference not in degree but of kind. It is not merely\r\nthat new principles have been discovered, but that new faculties seem to\r\nbe exerted. It is not that at one time the human intellect should have\r\nmade but small progress, and at another time have advanced far; but\r\nthat at one time it should have been stationary, and at another time\r\nconstantly proceeding. In taste and imagination, in the graces of style,\r\nin the arts of persuasion, in the magnificence of public works, the\r\nancients were at least our equals. They reasoned as justly as ourselves\r\non subjects which required pure demonstration. But in the moral sciences\r\nthey made scarcely {411}any advance. During the long period which\r\nelapsed between the fifth century before the Christian era and the\r\nfifth century after it little perceptible progress was made. All the\r\nmetaphysical discoveries of all the philosophers, from the time of\r\nSocrates to the northern invasion, are not to be compared in importance\r\nwith those which have been made in England every fifty years since the\r\ntime of Elizabeth. There is not the least reason to believe that the\r\nprinciples of government, legislation, and political economy, were\r\nbetter understood in the time of Augustus Cæsar than in the time\r\nof Pericles. In our own country, the sound doctrines of trade and\r\njurisprudence have been, within the lifetime of a single generation,\r\ndimly hinted, boldly propounded, defended, systematised, adopted by\r\nall reflecting men of all parties, quoted in legislative assemblies,\r\nincorporated into laws and treaties.\r\n\r\nTo what is this change to be attributed? Partly, no doubt, to the\r\ndiscovery of printing, a discovery which has not only diffused knowledge\r\nwidely, but, as we have already observed, has also introduced into\r\nreasoning a precision unknown in those ancient communities, in which\r\ninformation was, for the most part, conveyed orally. There was, we\r\nsuspect, another cause, less obvious, but still more powerful.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the two most famous nations of antiquity was remarkably\r\nexclusive. In the time of Homer the Greeks had not begun to consider\r\nthemselves as a distinct race. They still looked with something of\r\nchildish wonder and awe on the riches and wisdom of Sidon and Egypt.\r\nFrom what causes, and by what gradations, their feelings underwent a\r\nchange, it is not easy to determine. Their history, from the Trojan to\r\nthe Persian war, is covered with an obscurity broken {412}only by dim\r\nand scattered gleams of truth. But it is certain that a great alteration\r\ntook place. They regarded themselves as a separate people. They had\r\ncommon religious rites, and common principles of public law, in which\r\nforeigners had no part. In all their political systems, monarchical,\r\naristocratical, and demo-cratical, there was a strong family likeness.\r\nAfter the retreat of Xerxes and the fall of Mardonius, national pride\r\nrendered the separation between the Greeks and the barbarians complete.\r\nThe conquerors considered themselves men of a superior breed, men who,\r\nin them intercourse with neighbouring nations, were to teach, and not to\r\nlearn. They looked for nothing out of themselves. They borrowed nothing.\r\nThey translated nothing. We cannot call to mind a single expression of\r\nany Greek writer earlier than the age of Augustus, indicating an opinion\r\nthat anything worth reading could be written in any language except his\r\nown. The feelings which sprung from national glory were not altogether\r\nextinguished by national degradation. They were fondly cherished through\r\nages of slavery and shame. The literature of Rome herself was regarded\r\nwith contempt by those who had fled before her arms, and who bowed\r\nbeneath her fasces. Voltaire says, in one of his six thousand pamphlets,\r\nthat lu was the first person who told the French that England had\r\nproduced eminent men besides the Duke of Marlborough. Down to a\r\nvery late period, the Greeks seem to have stood in need of similar\r\ninformation with respect to their masters. With Paulus Æmilius,\r\nSylla, and Cæsar they were well acquainted. But the notions which they\r\nentertained respecting Cicero and Virgil were, probably, not unlike\r\nthose which Boileau may have formed about Shakspeare. Dionysius lived\r\n{413}in the most splendid age of Latin poetry and eloquence. He was a\r\ncritic, and, after the manner of his age, an able critic. He studied\r\nthe language of Rome, associated with its learned men, and compiled its\r\nhistory. Yet he seems to have thought its literature valuable only for\r\nthe purpose of illustrating its antiquities. His reading appears to have\r\nbeen confined to its public records, and to a few old annalists. Once,\r\nand but once, if we remember rightly, he quotes Ennius, to solve a\r\nquestion of etymology. He has written much on the art of oratory: yet he\r\nhas not mentioned the name of Cicero.\r\n\r\nThe Romans submitted to the pretensions of a race which they despised.\r\nTheir epic poet, while he claimed for them pre-eminence in the arts of\r\ngovernment and war, acknowledged their inferiority in taste, eloquence,\r\nand science. Men of letters affected to understand the Greek language\r\nbetter than their own. Pomponius preferred the honour of becoming an\r\nAthenian, by intellectual naturalisation, to all the distinctions which\r\nwere to be acquired in the political contests of Rome. His great\r\nfriend composed Greek poems and memoirs. It is well known that Petrarch\r\nconsidered that beautiful language in which his sonnets are written,\r\nas a barbarous jargon, and intrusted his fame to those wretched Latin\r\nhexameters which, during the last four centuries, have scarcely found\r\nfour readers. Many eminent Romans appear to have felt the same contempt\r\nfor their native tongue as compared with the Greek. The prejudice\r\ncontinued to a very late period. Julian was as partial to the Greek\r\nlanguage as Frederic the Great to the French: and it seems that he could\r\nnot express himself with elegance in the dialect of the state which\r\nhe ruled. {414}Even those Latin writers who did not carry this\r\naffectation so far looked on Greece as the only fount of knowledge. From\r\nGreece they derived the measures of their poetry, and, indeed, all of\r\npoetry that can be imported. From Greece they borrowed the principles\r\nand the vocabulary of their philosophy. To the literature of other\r\nnations they do not seem to have paid the slightest attention. The\r\nsacred books of the Hebrews, for example, books which, considered merely\r\nas human compositions, are invaluable to the critic, the antiquarian,\r\nand the philosopher, seem to have been utterly unnoticed by them.\r\nThe peculiarities of Judaism, and the rapid growth of Christianity,\r\nattracted their notice. They made war against the Jews. They made\r\nlaws against the Christians. But they never opened the books of Moses.\r\nJuvenal quotes the Pentateuch with censure. The author of the treatise\r\non “the Sublime” quotes it with praise: but both of them quote it\r\nerroneously. When we consider what sublime poetry, what curious history,\r\nwhat striking and peculiar views of the Divine nature and of the\r\nsocial duties of men, are to be found in the Jewish scriptures, when\r\nwe consider that two sects on which the attention of the government was\r\nconstantly fixed appealed to those scriptures as the rule of their faith\r\nand practice, this indifference is astonishing. The fact seems to be,\r\nthat the Greeks admired only themselves, and that the Romans admired\r\nonly themselves and the Greeks. Literary men turned away with disgust\r\nfrom modes of thought and expression so widely different from all\r\nthat they had been accustomed to admire. The effect was narrowness and\r\nsameness of thought. Their minds, if we may so express ourselves,\r\nbred in and in, and were accordingly cursed with barrenness {415}and\r\ndegeneracy. No extraneous beauty or vigour was engrafted on the decaying\r\nstock. By an exclusive attention to one class of phenomena, by an\r\nexclusive taste for one species of excellence, the human intellect\r\nwas stunted. Occasional coincidences were turned into general rules.\r\nPrejudices were confounded with instincts. On man, as he was found in\r\na particular state of society--on government, as it had existed in a\r\nparticular corner of the world, many just observations were made; but\r\nof man as man, or government as government, little was known. Philosophy\r\nremained stationary. Slight changes, sometimes for the worse and\r\nsometimes for the better, were made in the superstructure. But nobody\r\nthought of examining the foundations.\r\n\r\nThe vast despotism of the Cæsars, gradually effacing all national\r\npeculiarities, and assimilating the remotest provinces of the empire to\r\neach other, augmented the evil. At the close of the third century after\r\nChrist, the prospects of mankind were fearfully dreary. A system of\r\netiquette, as pompously frivolous as that of the Escurial, had been\r\nestablished. A sovereign almost invisible; a crowd of dignitaries\r\nminutely distinguished by badges and titles; rhetoricians who said\r\nnothing but what had been said ten thousand times; schools in ‘which\r\nnothing was taught but what had been known for ages: such was the\r\nmachinery provided for the government and instruction of the most\r\nenlightened part of the human race. That great community was then in\r\ndanger of experiencing a calamity far more terrible than any of\r\nthe quick, inflammatory, destroying maladies, to which nations are\r\nliable,--a tottering, drivelling, paralytic longevity, the immortality\r\nof the Struldbrugs, a Chinese civilisation. It would be easy to indicate\r\nmany points of resemblance {416}between the subjects of Diocletian\r\nand the people of that Celestial Empire, where, during many centuries,\r\nnothing has been learned or unlearned: where government, where\r\neducation, where the whole system of life, is a ceremony; where\r\nknowledge forgets to increase and multiply, and, like the talent buried\r\nin the earth, or the pound wrapped up in the napkin, experiences neither\r\nwaste nor augmentation.\r\n\r\nThe torpor was broken by two great revolutions, the one moral, the other\r\npolitical, the one from within, the other from without. The victory of\r\nChristianity over Paganism, considered with relation to this subject\r\nonly, was of great importance. It overthrew the old system of morals;\r\nand with it much of the old system of metaphysics. It furnished the\r\norator with new topics of declamation, and the logician with new points\r\nof controversy. Above all, it introduced a new principle, of which the\r\noperation was constantly felt in every part of society. It stirred the\r\nstagnant mass from the inmost depths. It excited all the passions of a\r\nstormy democracy in the quiet and listless population of an overgrown\r\nempire. The fear of heresy did what the sense of oppression could not\r\ndo; it changed men, accustomed to be turned over like sheep from tyrant\r\nto tyrant, into devoted partisans and obstinate rebels. The tones of an\r\neloquence which had been silent for ages resounded from the pulpit of\r\nGregory. A spirit which had been extinguished on the plains of Philippi\r\nrevived in Athanasius and Ambrose.\r\n\r\nYet even this remedy was not sufficiently violent for the disease. It\r\ndid not prevent the empire of Constantinople from relapsing, after a\r\nshort paroxysm of excitement, into a state of stupefaction, to\r\nwhich history furnishes scarcely any parallel. We there find that a\r\n{417}polished society, a society in which a most intricate and elaborate\r\nsystem of jurisprudence was established, in which the arts of luxury\r\nwere well understood, in which the works of the great ancient writers\r\nwere preserved and studied, existed for nearly a thousand years without\r\nmaking one great discovery in science, or producing one book which\r\nis read by any but curious inquirers. There were tumults, too, and\r\ncontroversies, and wars in abundance: and these things, bad as they are\r\nin themselves, have generally been favourable to the progress of the\r\nintellect. But here they tormented without stimulating. The waters were\r\ntroubled; but no healing influence descended. The agitations resembled\r\nthe grinnings and writhings of a galvanised corpse, not the struggles of\r\nan athletic man.\r\n\r\nFrom this miserable state the Western Empire was saved by the fiercest\r\nand most destroying visitation with which God has ever chastened\r\nhis creatures--the invasion of the Northern nations. Such a cure was\r\nrequired for such a distemper. The fire of London, it has been observed,\r\nwas a blessing. It burned down the city; but it burned out the plague.\r\nThe same may be said of the tremendous devastation of the Roman\r\ndominions. It annihilated the noisome recesses in which lurked the seeds\r\nof great moral maladies; it cleared an atmosphere fatal to the health\r\nand vigour of the human mind. It cost Europe a thousand years of\r\nbarbarianism to escape the fate of China.\r\n\r\nAt length the terrible purification was accomplished; and the second\r\ncivilisation of mankind commenced, under circumstances which afforded a\r\nstrong security that it would never retrograde and never pause. Europe\r\nwas now a great federal community. Her numerous states were united by\r\nthe easy ties of international law {418}and a common religion.\r\nTheir institutions, their languages, their manners, their tastes in\r\nliterature, their modes of education, were widely different. Their\r\nconnection was close enough to allow of mutual observation and\r\nimprovement, yet not so close as to destroy the idioms of national\r\nopinion and feeling.\r\n\r\nThe balance of moral and intellectual influence thus established\r\nbetween the nations of Europe is far more important than the balance\r\nof political power. Indeed, we are inclined to think that the latter\r\nis valuable principally because it tends to maintain the former. The\r\ncivilised world has thus been preserved from an uniformity of character\r\nfatal to all improvement. Every part of it has been illuminated with\r\nlight reflected from every other. Competition has produced activity\r\nwhere monopoly would have produced sluggishness. The number of\r\nexperiments in moral science which the speculator has an opportunity of\r\nwitnessing has been increased beyond all calculation. Society and human\r\nnature, instead of being seen in a single point of view, are presented\r\nto him under ten thousand different aspects. By observing the manners of\r\nsurrounding nations, by studying their literature, by comparing it with\r\nthat of his own country and of the ancient republics, he is enabled to\r\ncorrect those errors into which the most acute men must fall when they\r\nreason from a single species to a genus. He learns to distinguish\r\nwhat is local from what is universal; what is transitory from what is\r\neternal; to discriminate between exceptions and rules; to trace the\r\noperation of disturbing causes; to separate those general principles\r\nwhich are always true and everywhere applicable from the accidental\r\ncircumstances with which, in every community, they are blended, and with\r\nwhich, in an isolated community, {419}they are confounded by the most\r\nphilosophical mind.\r\n\r\nHence it is that, in generalisation, the writers of modern times have\r\nfar surpassed those of antiquity. The historians of our own country are\r\nunequalled in depth and precision of reason; and, even in the works of\r\nour mere compilers, we often meet with speculations beyond the reach of\r\nThucydides or Tacitus.\r\n\r\nBut it must, at the same time, be admitted that they have characteristic\r\nfaults, so closely connected with their characteristic merits, and of\r\nsuch magnitude, that it may well be doubted whether, on the whole,\r\nthis department of literature has gained or lost during the last\r\ntwo-and-twenty centuries.\r\n\r\nThe best historians of later times have been seduced from truth, not\r\nby their imagination, but by their reason. They far excel their\r\npredecessors in the art of deducing general principles from facts. But\r\nunhappily they have fallen into the error of distorting facts to suit\r\ngeneral principles. They arrive at a theory from looking at some of the\r\nphenomena; and the remaining phenomena they strain or curtail to suit\r\nthe theory. For this purpose it is not necessary that they should assert\r\nwhat is absolutely false; for all questions in morals and politics\r\nare questions of comparison and degree. Any proposition which does not\r\ninvolve a contradiction in terms may by possibility be true; and, if all\r\nthe circumstances which raise a probability in its favour be stated and\r\nenforced, and those which lead to an opposite conclusion be omitted or\r\nlightly passed over, it may appear to be demonstrated. In every\r\nhuman character and transaction there is a mixture of good\r\nand evil: a little exaggeration, a little suppression, a judicious use\r\nof epithets, a watchful and searching {420}scepticism with respect to\r\nthe evidence on one side, a convenient credulity with respect to every\r\nreport or tradition on the other, may easily make a saint of Laud, or a\r\ntyrant of Henry the Fourth.\r\n\r\nThis species of misrepresentation abounds in the most valuable works of\r\nmodern historians. Herodotus tells his story like a slovenly witness,\r\nwho, heated by partialities and prejudices, unacquainted with the\r\nestablished rules of evidence, and uninstructed as to the obligations\r\nof his oath, confounds what he imagines with what he has seen and heard,\r\nand brings out facts, reports, conjectures, and fancies, in one mass.\r\nHume is an accomplished advocate. Without positively asserting much more\r\nthan he can prove, he gives prominence to all the circumstances which\r\nsupport his case; he glides lightly over those which are unfavourable to\r\nit; his own witnesses are applauded and encouraged; the statements which\r\nseem to throw discredit on them are controverted; the contradictions\r\ninto which they fall are explained away; a clear and connected abstract\r\nof their evidence is given. Everything that is offered on the other side\r\nis scrutinised with the utmost severity; every suspicious circumstance\r\nis a ground for comment and invective; what cannot be denied is\r\nextenuated, or passed by without notice; concessions even are sometimes\r\nmade: but this insidious candour only increases the effect of the vast\r\nmass of sophistry.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned Hume as the ablest and most popular writer of his\r\nclass; but the charge which we have brought against him is one to which\r\nall our most distinguished historians are in some degree obnoxious.\r\nGibbon, in particular, deserves very severe censure. Of all the numerous\r\nculprits, however, none is more deeply guilty than Mr. Mitford. We\r\nwillingly acknowledge {421}the obligations which are due to his talents\r\nand industry. The modern historians of Greece had been in the habit of\r\nwriting as if the world had learned nothing new during the last sixteen\r\nhundred years. Instead of illustrating the events which they narrated\r\nby the philosophy of a more enlightened age, they judged of antiquity by\r\nitself alone. They seemed to think that notions, long driven from every\r\nother corner of literature, had a prescriptive right to occupy this\r\nlast fastness. They considered all the ancient historians as equally\r\nauthentic. They scarcely made any distinction between him who related\r\nevents at which he had himself been present and him who five hundred\r\nyears after composed a philosophic romance for a society which had in\r\nthe interval undergone a complete change. It was all Greek, and all\r\ntrue! The centuries which separated Plutarch from Thucydides seemed\r\nas nothing to men who lived in an age so remote. The distance of\r\ntime produced an error similar to that which is sometimes produced by\r\ndistance of place. There are many good ladies who think that all the\r\npeople in India live together, and who charge a friend setting out for\r\nCalcutta with kind messages to Bombay. To Rollin and Barthelemi, in the\r\nsame manner, all the classics were contemporaries.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitford certainly introduced great improvements; he showed us that\r\nmen who wrote in Greek and Latin sometimes told lies; he showed us that\r\nancient history might be related in such a manner as to furnish not only\r\nallusions to school boys, but important lessons to statesmen. From that\r\nlove of theatrical effect and high-flown sentiment which had poisoned\r\nalmost every other work on the same subject his book is perfectly free.\r\nBut his passion for a theory as false, and far {422}more ungenerous,\r\nled him substantially to violate truth in every page. Statements\r\nunfavourable to democracy are made with unhesitating confidence, and\r\nwith the utmost bitterness of language. Every charge brought against a\r\nmonarch or an aristocracy is sifted with the utmost care. If it cannot\r\nbe denied, some palliating supposition is suggested; or we are at least\r\nreminded that some circumstances now unknown may have justified what\r\nat present appears unjustifiable. Two events are reported by the same\r\nauthor in the same sentence; their truth rests on the same testimony;\r\nbut the one supports the darling hypothesis, and the other seems\r\ninconsistent with it. The one is taken and the other is left.\r\n\r\nThe practice of distorting narrative into a conformity with theory is\r\na vice not so unfavourable as at first sight it may appear to the\r\ninterests of political science. We have compared the writers who indulge\r\nin it to advocates; and we may add, that their conflicting fallacies,\r\nlike those of advocates, correct each other. It has always been held,\r\nin the most enlightened nations, that a tribunal will decide a judicial\r\nquestion most fairly when it has heard two able men argue, as unfairly\r\nas possible, on the two opposite sides of it; and we are inclined\r\nto think that this opinion is just. Sometimes, it is true, superior\r\neloquence and dexterity will make the worse appear the better reason;\r\nbut it is at least certain that the judge will be compelled to\r\ncontemplate the case under two different aspects. It is certain that no\r\nimportant consideration will altogether escape notice.\r\n\r\nThis is at present the state of history. The poet laureate appears for\r\nthe Church of England, Lingard for the Church of Rome. Brodie has moved\r\nto set {423}aside the verdicts obtained by Hume; and the cause in which\r\nMitford succeeded is, we understand, about to be reheard. In the midst\r\nof these disputes, however, history proper, if we may use the term, is\r\ndisappearing. The high, grave, impartial summing up of Thucydides is\r\nnowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nWhile our historians are practising all the arts of controversy, they\r\nmiserably neglect the art of narration, the art of interesting the\r\naffections and presenting pictures to the imagination. That a writer may\r\nproduce these effects without violating truth is sufficiently proved\r\nby many excellent biographical works. The immense popularity which\r\nwell-written books of this kind have acquired deserves the serious\r\nconsideration of historians. Voltaire’s Charles the Twelfth, Marmontel’s\r\nMemoirs, Boswell’s Life of Johnson, Southey’s account of Nelson, are\r\nperused with delight by the most frivolous and indolent. Whenever\r\nany tolerable book of the same description makes its appearance, the\r\ncirculating libraries are mobbed; the book societies are in commotion;\r\nthe new novel lies uncut; the magazines and newspapers fill their\r\ncolumns with extracts. In the meantime histories of great empires,\r\nwritten by men of eminent ability, lie unread on the shelves of\r\nostentatious libraries.\r\n\r\nThe writers of history seem to entertain an aristocratical contempt\r\nfor the writers of memoirs. They think it beneath the dignity of men\r\nwho describe the revolutions of nations to dwell on the details which\r\nconstitute the charm of biography. They have imposed on themselves a\r\ncode of conventional decencies as absurd as that which has been the\r\nbanc of the French drama. The most characteristic and interesting\r\ncircumstances are omitted or softened down, because, {424}as we are\r\ntold, they are too trivial for the majesty of history. The majesty of\r\nhistory seems to resemble the majesty of the poor King of Spain, who\r\ndied a martyr to ceremony because the proper dignitaries were not at\r\nhand to render him assistance.\r\n\r\nThat history would be more amusing if this etiquette were relaxed will,\r\nwe suppose, be acknowledged. But would it be less dignified or less\r\nuseful? What do we mean when we say that one past event is important and\r\nanother insignificant? No past event has any intrinsic importance.\r\nThe knowledge of it is valuable only as it leads us to form just\r\ncalculations with respect to the future. A history which does not\r\nserve this purpose, though it may be filled with battles, treaties, and\r\ncommotions, is as useless as the series of turnpike tickets collected by\r\nSir Matthew Mite.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that Lord Clarendon, instead of filling hundreds of folio\r\npages with copies of state papers, in which the same assertions\r\nand contradictions are repeated till the reader is overpowered with\r\nweariness, had condescended to be the Boswell of the Long Parliament.\r\nLet us suppose that he had exhibited to us the wise and lofty\r\nself-government of Hampden, leading while he seemed to follow, and\r\npropounding unanswerable arguments in the strongest forms with the\r\nmodest air of an inquirer anxious for information; the delusions which\r\nmisled the noble spirit of Vane; the coarse fanaticism which concealed\r\nthe yet loftier genius of Cromwell, destined to control a mutinous\r\narmy and a factious people, to abase the flag of Holland, to arrest\r\nthe victorious arms of Sweden, and to hold the balance firm between the\r\nrival monarchies of France and Spain. Let us suppose that he had made\r\nhis Cavaliers and Roundheads talk in their own {425}style; that he had\r\nreported some of the ribaldry of Rupert’s pages, and some of the cant of\r\nHarrison and Fleetwood. Would not his work in that ease have been more\r\ninteresting? Would it not have been more accurate?\r\n\r\nA history in which every particular incident may be true may on the\r\nwhole be false. The circumstances which have most influence on the\r\nhappiness of mankind, the changes of manners and morals, the transition\r\nof communities from poverty to wealth, from knowledge to ignorance,\r\nfrom ferocity to humanity--these are, for the most part, noiseless\r\nrevolutions. Their progress is rarely indicated by what historians are\r\npleased to call important events. They are not achieved by armies, or\r\nenacted by senates. They are sanctioned by no treaties and recorded\r\nin no archives. They are carried on in every school, in every church,\r\nbehind ten thousand counters, at ten thousand firesides. The upper\r\ncurrent of society presents no certain criterion by which we can judge\r\nof the direction in which the under current flows. We read of defeats\r\nand victories. But we know that nations may be miserable amidst\r\nvictories and prosperous amidst defeats. We read of the fall of wise\r\nministers and of the rise of profligate favourites. But we must remember\r\nhow small a proportion the good or evil effected by a single statesman\r\ncan bear to the good or evil of a great social system.\r\n\r\nBishop Watson compares a geologist to a gnat mounted on an elephant,\r\nand laying down theories as to the whole internal structure of the vast\r\nanimal, from the phenomena of the hide. The comparison is unjust to the\r\ngeologists; but it is very applicable to those historians who write as\r\nif the body politic were homogeneous, {426}who look only on the surface\r\nof affairs, and never think of the mighty and various organisation which\r\nlies deep below.\r\n\r\nIn the works of such writers as these, England, at the close of the\r\nSeven Years’ War, is in the highest state of prosperity: at the close of\r\nthe American war she is in a miserable and degraded condition; as if\r\nthe people were not on the whole as rich, as well governed, and as\r\nwell educated at the latter period as at the former. We have read books\r\ncalled Histories of England, under the reign of George the Second, in\r\nwhich the rise of Methodism is not even mentioned. A hundred years hence\r\nthis breed of authors will, we hope, be extinct. If it should still\r\nexist, the late ministerial interregnum will be described in terms which\r\nwill seem to imply that all government was at an end; that the social\r\ncontract was annulled; and that the hand of every man was against his\r\nneighbour, until the wisdom and virtue of the new cabinet educed order\r\nout of the chaos of anarchy. We are quite certain that misconceptions\r\nas gross prevail at this moment respecting many important parts of our\r\nannals.\r\n\r\nThe effect of historical reading is analogous, In many respects, to\r\nthat produced by foreign travel. The student, like the tourist, is\r\ntransported into a new state of society. He sees new fashions. He hears\r\nnew modes of expression. His mind is enlarged by contemplating the wide\r\ndiversities of laws, of morals, and of manners. But men may travel far,\r\nand return with minds as contracted as if they had never stirred from\r\ntheir own market-town. In the same manner, men may know the dates of\r\nmany battles and the genealogies of many royal houses, and yet be\r\nno wiser. Most people look at past times as princes look at foreign\r\n{427}countries. More than one illustrious stranger has landed on our\r\nisland amidst the shouts of a mob, has dined with the king, has hinted\r\nwith the master of the stag-hounds, has seen the guards reviewed, and\r\na knight of the garter installed, has cantered along Regent Street,\r\nhas visited St. Paul’s, and noted down its dimensions; and has then\r\ndeparted, thinking that he has seen England. He has, in faet, seen a few\r\npublic buildings, public men, and public ceremonies. But of the vast\r\nand complex system of society, of the fine shades of national charaeter,\r\nof the practical operation of government and laws, he knows nothing.\r\nHe who would understand these things rightly must not confine his\r\nobservations to palaces and solemn days. He must see ordinary men as\r\nthey appear in their ordinary business and in their ordinary pleasures.\r\nHe must mingle in the crowds of the exchange and the coffeehouse. He\r\nmust obtain admittance to the convivial table and the domestic hearth.\r\nHe must bear with vulgar expressions. He must not shrink from exploring\r\neven the retreats of misery. He who wishes to understand the condition\r\nof mankind in former ages must proceed on the same principle. If he\r\nattends only to public transactions, to wars, congresses, and debates,\r\nhis studies will be as unprofitable as the travels of those imperial,\r\nroyal, and serene sovereigns who form their judgment of our island from\r\nhaving gone in state to a few fine sights, and from having held formal\r\nconferences with a few great officers.\r\n\r\nThe perfect historian is he in whose work the character and spirit of\r\nan age is exhibited in miniature. He relates no faet, he attributes no\r\nexpression to his characters, which is not authenticated by sufficient\r\ntestimony. But, by judicious selection, rejection, and arrangement,\r\n{428}he gives to truth those attractions which have been usurped\r\nby fiction. In his narrative a due subordination is observed: some\r\ntransactions are prominent; others retire. But the scale on which he\r\nrepresents them is increased or diminished, not according to the dignity\r\nof the persons concerned in them, but according to the degree in which\r\nthey elucidate the condition of society and the nature of man. He shows\r\nus the court, the camp, and the senate. But he shows ns also the nation.\r\nHe considers no anecdote, no peculiarity of manner, no familiar saying,\r\nas too insignificant for his notice which is not too insignificant to\r\nillustrate the operation of laws, of religion, and of education, and to\r\nmark the progress of the human mind. Men will not merely be described,\r\nbut will be made intimately known to us. The changes of manners will be\r\nindicated, not merely by a few general phrases or a few extracts from\r\nstatistical documents, but by appropriate images presented in every\r\nline.\r\n\r\nIf a man, such as we are supposing, should write the history of England,\r\nhe would assuredly not omit the battles, the sieges, the negotiations,\r\nthe seditions, the ministerial changes. But with these he would\r\nintersperse the details which are the charm of historical romances. At\r\nLincoln Cathedral there is a beautiful painted window, which was made by\r\nan apprentice out of the pieces of glass which had been rejected by\r\nhis master. It is so far superior to every other in the church, that,\r\naccording to the tradition, the vanquished artist killed himself from\r\nmortification. Sir Walter Scott, in the same manner, has used those\r\nfragments of truth which historians have scornfully thrown behind them\r\nin a manner which may well excite their envy. He has constructed out\r\nof their gleanings works which, {429}even considered as histories, are\r\nscarcely less valuable than their’s. But a truly great historian would\r\nreclaim those materials which the novelist has appropriated. The\r\nhistory of the government, and the history of the people, would be\r\nexhibited in that mode in which alone they can be exhibited justly, in\r\ninseparable conjunction and intermixture. We should not then have to\r\nlook for the wars of the Puritans in Clarendon, and for their\r\nphraseology in Old Mortality; for one half of King James in Hume, and\r\nfor the other half in the Fortunes of Nigel.\r\n\r\nThe early part of our imaginary history would be rich witli colouring\r\nfrom romance, ballad, and chronicle. We should find ourselves in the\r\ncompany of knights such as those of Froissart, and of pilgrims such as\r\nthose who rode witli Chaucer from the Tabard. Society would be shown\r\nfrom the highest to the lowest,--from the royal cloth of state to the\r\nden of the outlaw; from the throne of the legate, to the chimney-corner\r\nwhere the begging friar regaled himself. Palmers, minstrels,\r\ncrusaders,--the stately monastery, with the good cheer in its refectory\r\nand the high-mass in its chapel,--the manor-house, witli its hunting and\r\nhawking,--the tournament, with the heralds and ladies, the trumpets\r\nand the cloth of gold,--would give truth and life to the representation.\r\nWe should perceive, in a thousand slight touches, the importance of\r\nthe privileged burgher, and the fierce and haughty spirit which swelled\r\nunder the collar of the degraded villain. The revival of letters would\r\nnot merely be described in a few magnificent periods. We should discern,\r\nin innumerable particulars, the fermentation of mind, the eager appetite\r\nfor knowledge, which distinguished the sixteenth from the fifteenth\r\ncentury. In the Reformation {430}we should see, not merely a schism\r\nwhich changed the ecclesiastical constitution of England and the mutual\r\nrelations of the European powers, but a moral war which raged in every\r\nfamily, which set the father against the son, and the son against the\r\nfather, the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the\r\nmother. Henry would be painted with the skill of Tacitus. We should have\r\nthe change of his character from his profuse and joyous youth to his\r\nsavage and imperious old age. We should perceive the gradual progress\r\nof selfish and tyrannical passions in a mind not naturally insensible or\r\nungenerous; and to the last we should detect some remains of that open\r\nand noble temper which endeared him to a people whom he oppressed,\r\nstruggling with the hardness of despotism and the irritability of\r\ndisease. We should see Elizabeth in all her weakness and in all her\r\nstrength, surrounded by the handsome favourites whom she never trusted,\r\nand the wise old statesmen whom she never dismissed, uniting in herself\r\nthe most contradictory qualities of both her parents,--the coquetry, the\r\ncaprice, the petty malice of Anne,--the haughty and resolute spirit of\r\nHenry. We have no hesitation in saying that a great artist might produce\r\na portrait of this remarkable woman at least as striking as that in the\r\nnovel of Kenilworth, without employing a single trait not authenticated\r\nby ample testimony. In the meantime, we should see arts cultivated,\r\nwealth accumulated, the conveniences of life improved. We should see the\r\nkeeps, where nobles, insecure themselves, spread insecurity around them,\r\ngradually giving place to the halls of peaceful opulence, to the oriels\r\nof Longleat, and the stately pinnacles of Burleigh. We should see towns\r\nextended, deserts cultivated, the hamlets of fishermen {431}turned\r\ninto wealthy havens, the meal of the peasant improved, and his but more\r\ncommodiously furnished. We should see those opinions and feelings which\r\nproduced the great struggle against the house of Stuart slowly growing\r\nup in the bosom of private families, before they manifested themselves\r\nin parliamentary debates. Then would come the civil war. Those\r\nskirmishes on which Clarendon dwells so minutely would be told, as\r\nThucydides would have told them, with perspicuous conciseness. They are\r\nmerely connecting links. But the great characteristics of the age, the\r\nloyal enthusiasm of the brave English gentry, the fierce licentiousness\r\nof the swearing, dicing, drunken reprobates, whose excesses disgrace the\r\nroyal cause,--the austerity of the Presbyterian Sabbaths in the city,\r\nthe extravagance of the independent preachers in the camp, the precise\r\ngarb, the severe countenance, the petty scruples, the affected accent,\r\nthe absurd names and phrases which marked the Puritans,--the valour,\r\nthe policy, the public spirit, which lurked beneath these ungraceful\r\ndisguises,--the dreams of the raving Fifth-monarchy-man, the dreams,\r\nscarcely less wild, of the philosophic republican,--all these would\r\nenter into the representation, and render it at once more exact and more\r\nstriking.\r\n\r\nThe instruction derived from history thus written would be of a vivid\r\nand practical character. It would be received by the imagination as well\r\nas by the reason. It would be not merely traced on the mind, but branded\r\ninto it. Many truths, too, would be learned, which can be learned in\r\nno other manner. As the history of states is generally written, the\r\ngreatest and most momentous revolutions seem to come upon them like\r\nsupernatural inflictions, without warning {432}or cause. But the fact\r\nis, that such revolutions are almost always the consequences of moral\r\nchanges, which have gradually passed on the mass of the community, and\r\nwhich ordinarily proceed far before their progress is indicated by any\r\npublic measure. An intimate knowledge of the domestic history of nations\r\nis therefore absolutely necessary to the prognosis of political events.\r\nA narrative, defective in this respect, is as useless as a medical\r\ntreatise which should pass by all the symptoms attendant on the early\r\nstage of a disease and mention only what occurs when the patient is\r\nbeyond the reach of remedies.\r\n\r\nA historian, such as we have been attempting to describe, would indeed\r\nbe an intellectual prodigy. In his mind, powers scarcely compatible with\r\neach other must be tempered into an exquisite harmony. We shall sooner\r\nsee another Shakspeare or another Homer. The highest excellence to which\r\nany single faculty can be brought would be less surprising than such a\r\nhappy and delicate combination of qualities. Yet the contemplation of\r\nimaginary models is not an unpleasant or useless employment of the mind.\r\nIt cannot indeed produce perfection; but it produces improvement,\r\nand nourishes that generous and liberal fastidiousness which is not\r\ninconsistent with the strongest sensibility to merit, and which, while\r\nit exalts our conceptions of the art, does not render us unjust to the\r\nartist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHALLAM. (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n{433}(_Edinburgh Review_, September 1828.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory, at least in its state of ideal perfection, is a compound of\r\npoetry and philosophy. It impresses general truths on the mind by a\r\nvivid representation of particular characters and incidents. But, in\r\nfact, the two hostile elements of which it consists have never been\r\nknown to form a perfect amalgamation; and at length, in our own time,\r\nthey have been completely and professedly separated. Good histories, in\r\nthe proper sense of the word, we have not. But we have good historical\r\nromances, and good historical essays. The imagination and the reason,\r\nif we may use a legal metaphor, have made partition of a province of\r\nliterature of which they were formerly seised _per my et per tout_; and\r\nnow they hold their respective portions in severalty, instead of holding\r\nthe whole in common.\r\n\r\nTo make the past present, to bring the distant near, to place us in the\r\nsociety of a great man or on the eminence which overlooks the field of\r\na mighty battle, to invest with the reality of human flesh and blood\r\nbeings whom we are too much inclined to consider as personified\r\nqualities in an allegory, to call up our ancestors before us with all\r\ntheir peculiarities of language,\r\n\r\n     (1) The Constitutional History of England, from the\r\n     Accession of Henry VII to the Death of George II. By Henry\r\n     Hallam. In 2 vols. 1827.\r\n\r\n{434}manners, and garb, to show us over their houses, to scat us at\r\ntheir tables, to rummage their old-fashioned wardrobes, to explain\r\nthe uses of their ponderous furniture, these parts of the duty which\r\nproperly belongs to the historian have been appropriated by the\r\nhistorical novelist. On the other hand, to extract the philosophy\r\nof history, to direct our judgment of events and men, to trace the\r\nconnection of causes and effects, and to draw from the occurrences of\r\nformer times general lessons of moral and political wisdom, has become\r\nthe business of a distinct class of writers.\r\n\r\nOf the two kinds of composition into which history has been thus\r\ndivided, the one may be compared to a map, the other to a painted\r\nlandscape. The picture, though it places the country before us, does not\r\nenable us to ascertain with accuracy the dimensions, the distances, and\r\nthe angles. The map is not a work of imitative art. It presents no scene\r\nto the imagination; but it gives us exact information as to the bearings\r\nof the various points, and is a more useful companion to the traveller\r\nor the general than the painted landscape could be, though it were the\r\ngrandest that ever Rosa peopled with outlaws, or the sweetest over which\r\nClaude ever poured the mellow effulgence of a setting sun.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the practice of separating the two ingredients of\r\nwhich history is composed has become prevalent on the Continent as well\r\nas in this country. Italy has already produced a historical novel, of\r\nhigh merit and of still higher promise. In France, the practice has been\r\ncarried to a length somewhat whimsical. M. Sismondi publishes a grave\r\nand stately history of the Merovingian Kings, very valuable, and a\r\nlittle tedious. He then sends forth as a companion to {435}it a novel,\r\nin which he attempts to give a lively representation of characters and\r\nmanners. This course, as it seems to us, has all the disadvantages of\r\na division of labour, and none of its advantages. We understand the\r\nexpediency of keeping the functions of cook and coachman distinct. The\r\ndinner will be better dressed, and the horses better managed. But where\r\nthe two situations are united, as in the Maître Jacques of Molière, we\r\ndo not see that the matter is much mended by the solemn form with which\r\nthe pluralist passes from one of his employments to the other.\r\n\r\nWe manage these things better in England. Sir Walter Scott gives us\r\na novel; Mr. Hallam a critical and argumentative history. Both are\r\noccupied with the same matter. But the former looks at it with the eye\r\nof a sculptor. His intention is to give an express and lively image of\r\nits external form. The latter is an anatomist. His task is to dissect\r\nthe subject to its inmost recesses, and to lay bare before us all the\r\nsprings of motion and all the causes of decay.\r\n\r\nMr. Hallam is, on the whole, far better qualified than any other\r\nwriter of our time for the office which he has undertaken. He has great\r\nindustry and great acuteness. His knowledge is extensive, various, and\r\nprofound. His mind is equally distinguished by the amplitude of its\r\ngrasp, and by the delicacy of its tact. His speculations have none of\r\nthat vagueness which is the common fault of political philosophy. On\r\nthe contrary, they are strikingly practical, and teach us not only the\r\ngeneral rule, but the mode of applying it to solve particular cases. In\r\nthis respect they often remind us of the Discourses of Machiavelli.\r\n\r\nThe style is sometimes open to the charge of harshness. We have also\r\nhere and there remarked a little {436}of that unpleasant trick, which\r\nGibbon brought into fashion, the trick, we mean, of telling a story\r\nby implication and allusion. Mr. Hallam, however, has an excuse which\r\nGibbon had not. His work is designed for readers who are already\r\nacquainted with the ordinary books on English history, and who can\r\ntherefore unriddle these little enigmas without difficulty. The manner\r\nof the book is, on the whole, not unworthy of the matter. The language,\r\neven where most faulty, is weighty and massive, and indicates strong\r\nsense in every line. It often rises to an eloquence, not florid or\r\nimpassioned, but high, grave, and sober; such as would become a state\r\npaper, or a judgment delivered by a great magistrate, a Somers or a\r\nD’Agnessean.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the character of Mr. Hallam’s mind corresponds\r\nstrikingly with that of his style. His work is eminently judicial. Its\r\nwhole spirit is that of the bench, not that of the bar. He sums up with\r\na calm, steady impartiality, turning neither to the right nor to the\r\nleft, glossing over nothing, exaggerating nothing, while the advocates\r\non both sides are alternately biting their lips to hear their\r\nconflicting misstatements and sophisms exposed. On a general survey,\r\nwe do not scruple to pronounce the Constitutional History the most\r\nimpartial book that we ever read. We think it the more incumbent on us\r\nto bear this testimony strongly at first setting out, because, in the\r\ncourse of our remarks, we shall think it right to dwell principally on\r\nthose parts of it from which we dissent.\r\n\r\nThere is one peculiarity about Mr. Hallam which, while it adds to the\r\nvalue of his writings, will, we fear, take away something from their\r\npopularity. He is less of a worshipper than any historian whom we\r\ncan {437}call to mind. Every political sect has its esoteric and its\r\nexoteric school, its abstract doctrines for the initiated, its visible\r\nsymbols, its imposing forms, its mythological fables for the vulgar. It\r\nassists the devotion of those who are unable to raise themselves to\r\nthe contemplation of pure truth by all the devices of Pagan or Papal\r\nsuperstition. It has its altars and its deified heroes, its relics and\r\npilgrimages, its canonized martyrs and confessors, its festivals and its\r\nlegendary miracles. Our pious ancestors, we are told, deserted the High\r\n* Altar of Canterbury, to lay all their obligations on the shrine of St.\r\nThomas. In the same manner the great and comfortable doctrines of the\r\nTory creed, those particularly which relate to restrictions on worship\r\nand on trade, are adored by squires and rectors in Pitt Clubs, under the\r\nname of a minister who was as bad a representative of the system which\r\nhas been christened after him as Bechet of the spirit of the Gospel. On\r\nthe other hand, the cause for which Hampden bled on the field and Sydney\r\non the scaffold is enthusiastically toasted by many an honest radical\r\nwho would be puzzled to explain the difference between Ship-money and\r\nthe Habeas Corpus Act. It may be added that, as in religion, so in\r\npolitics, few even of those who are enlightened enough to comprehend the\r\nmeaning latent under the emblems of their faith can resist the contagion\r\nof the popular superstition. Often, when they flatter themselves that\r\nthey are merely feigning a compliance with the prejudices of the vulgar,\r\nthey are themselves under the influence of those very prejudices. It\r\nprobably was not altogether on grounds of expediency that Socrates\r\ntaught his followers to honour the gods whom the state honoured, and\r\nbequeathed a cock to Esculapius with his dying breath. So there is often\r\n{438}a portion of willing credulity and enthusiasm in the veneration\r\nwhich the most discerning men pay to their political idols. From the\r\nvery nature of man it must be so. The faculty by which we inseparably\r\nassociate ideas which have often been presented to us in conjunction\r\nis not under the absolute control of the will. It may be quickened into\r\nmorbid activity. It may be reasoned into shamelessness. But in a certain\r\ndecree it will always exist. The almost absolute mastery which Mr.\r\nHallam has obtained over feelings of this class is perfectly astonishing\r\nto us, and will, we believe, be not only astonishing but offensive to\r\nmany of his readers. It must particularly disgust those people who, in\r\ntheir speculations on politics, are not reasoners but fanciers; whose\r\nopinions, even when sincere, are not produced, according to the\r\nordinary law of intellectual births, by induction or inference, but\r\nare equivocally generated by the heat of fervid tempers out of the\r\noverflowing of tumid imaginations. A man of this class is always\r\nin extremes. He cannot be a friend to liberty without calling for\r\na community of goods, or a friend to order without taking under his\r\nprotection the foulest excesses of tyranny. His admiration oscillates\r\nbetween the most worthless of rebels and the most worthless of\r\noppressors, between Marten, the disgrace of the High Court of Justice,\r\nand Laud, the disgrace of the Star Chamber. He can forgive any thing but\r\ntemperance and impartiality. He has a certain sympathy with the violence\r\nof his opponents, as well as with that of his associates. In every\r\nfurious partisan he sees either his present self or his former self,\r\nthe pensioner that is, or the Jacobin that has been. But he is unable to\r\ncomprehend a writer who, steadily attached to principles, is indifferent\r\nabout names and badges, and who judges {439}of characters with equable\r\nseverity, not altogether untinctured with cynicism, but free from the\r\nslightest touch of passion, party spirit, or caprice.\r\n\r\nWe should probably like Mr. Hallam’s book more if, instead of pointing\r\nout with strict fidelity the bright points and the dark spots of both\r\nparties, he had exerted himself to whitewash the one and to blacken the\r\nother. But we should certainly prize it far less. Eulogy and invective\r\nmay be had for the asking. But for cold rigid justice, the one weight\r\nand the one measure, we know not where else we can look.\r\n\r\nNo portion of our annals has been more perplexed and misrepresented by\r\nwriters of different parties than the history of the Reformation. In\r\nthis labyrinth of falsehood and sophistry, the guidance of Mr. Hallam\r\nis peculiarly valuable. It is impossible not to admire the even-handed\r\njustice with which he deals out castigation to right and left on the\r\nrival persecutors.\r\n\r\nIt is vehemently maintained by some writers of the present day that\r\nElizabeth persecuted neither Papists nor Puritans as such, and that the\r\nsevere measures which she occasionally adopted were dictated, not by\r\nreligious intolerance, but by political necessity. Even the excellent\r\naccount of those times which Mr. Hallam has given has not altogether\r\nimposed silence on the authors of this fallacy. The title of the Queen,\r\nthey say, was annulled by the Pope; her throne was given to another; her\r\nsubjects were incited to rebellion; her life was menaced; every Catholic\r\nwas bound in conscience to be a traitor; it was therefore against\r\ntraitors, not against Catholics, that the penal laws were enacted.\r\n\r\nIn order that our readers may be fully competent to appreciate the\r\nmerits of this defence, we will state. {440}as concisely as possible,\r\nthe substance of some of these laws.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Elizabeth ascended the throne, and before the least hostility\r\nto her government had been shown by the Catholic population, an act\r\npassed prohibiting the celebration of the rites of the Romish Church, on\r\npain of forfeiture for the first offence, of a year’s imprisonment for\r\nthe second, and of perpetual imprisonment for the third.\r\n\r\nA law was next made in 1562, enacting, that all who had ever graduated\r\nat the Universities or received holy orders, all lawyers, and all\r\nmagistrates, should take the oath of supremacy when tendered to them, on\r\npain of forfeiture and imprisonment during the royal pleasure. After the\r\nlapse of three months, the oath might again be tendered to them; and,\r\nif it were again refused, the recusant was guilty of high treason. A\r\nprospective law, however severe, framed to exclude Catholics from the\r\nliberal professions, would have been mercy itself compared with this\r\nodious act. It is a retrospective statute; it is a retrospective penal\r\nstatute; it is a retrospective penal statute against a large class. We\r\nwill not positively affirm that a law of this description must always,\r\nand under all circumstances, be unjustifiable. But the presumption\r\nagainst it is most violent; nor do we remember any crisis, either in our\r\nown history, or in the history of any other country, which would\r\nhave rendered such a provision necessary. In the present case,\r\nwhat circumstances called for extraordinary rigour? There might be\r\ndisaffection among the Catholics. The prohibition of their worship would\r\nnaturally produce it. But it is from their situation, not from their\r\nconduct, from the wrongs which they had suffered, not from those which\r\nthey {441}had committed, that the existence of discontent among them\r\nmust be inferred. There were libels, no doubt, and prophecies, and\r\nrumours, and suspicions, strange grounds for a law inflicting capital\r\npenalties, _ex post facto_, on a large body of men.\r\n\r\nEight years later, the bull of Pius deposing Elizabeth produced a third\r\nlaw. This law, to which alone, as we conceive, the defence now under our\r\nconsideration can apply, provides that, if any Catholic shall convert\r\na Protestant to the Romish Church, they shall both suffer death as for\r\nhigh treason.\r\n\r\nWe believe that we might safely content ourselves with stating the\r\nfact, and leaving it to the judgment of every plain Englishman. Recent\r\ncontroversies have, however, given so much importance to this subject,\r\nthat we will offer a few remarks on it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the arguments which are urged in favour of Elizabeth\r\napply with much greater force to the case of her sister Mary. The\r\nCatholics did not, at the time of Elizabeth’s accession, rise in arms\r\nto seat a Pretender on her throne. But before Mary had given, or could\r\ngive, provocation, the most distinguished Protestants attempted to\r\nset aside her rights in favour of the Lady Jane. That attempt, and the\r\nsubsequent insurrection of Wyatt, furnished at least as good a plea\r\nfor the burning of Protestants, as the conspiracies against Elizabeth\r\nfurnish for the hanging and embowelling of Papists.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that both pleas are worthless alike. If such arguments are\r\nto pass current, it will be easy to prove that there was never such a\r\nthing as religious persecution since the creation. For there never was\r\na religious persecution in which some odious crime was not, justly or\r\nunjustly, said to be obviously deducible {442}from the doctrines of the\r\npersecuted party. We might say that the Cæsars did not persecute the\r\nChristians; that they only punished men who were charged, rightly or\r\nwrongly, with burning Rome, and with committing the foulest abominations\r\nin secret assemblies; and that the refusal to throw frankincense on the\r\naltar of Jupiter was not the crime but only evidence of the crime.\r\nWe might say, that the massacre of St. Bartholomew was intended to\r\nextirpate, not a religious sect, but a political party. For, beyond all\r\ndoubt, the proceedings of the Huguenots, from the conspiracy of Amboise\r\nto the battle of Moncontour, had given much more trouble to the French\r\nmonarchy than the Catholics have ever given to the English monarchy\r\nsince the Reformation; and that too with much less excuse.\r\n\r\nThe true distinction is perfectly obvious. To punish a man because he\r\nhas committed a crime, or because he is believed, though unjustly, to\r\nhave committed a crime, is not persecution. To punish a man, because\r\nwe infer from the nature of some doctrine which he holds, or from the\r\nconduct of other persons who hold the same doctrines with him, that he\r\nwill commit a crime, is persecution, and is, in every case, foolish and\r\nwicked.\r\n\r\nWhen Elizabeth put Ballard and Babington to death, she was not\r\npersecuting. Nor should we have accused her government of persecution\r\nfor passing any law, however severe, against overt acts of sedition. But\r\nto argue that, because a man is a Catholic, he must think it right to\r\nmurder a heretical sovereign, and that because he thinks it right he\r\nwill attempt to do it, and then, to found on this conclusion a law for\r\npunishing him as if he had done it, is plain persecution.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, all men reasoned in the same manner on {443}the same data,\r\nand always did what they thought it their duty to do, this mode of\r\ndispensing punishment might be extremely judicious. But as people who\r\nagree about premises often disagree about conclusions, and as no man in\r\nthe world acts up to his own standard of right, there are two enormous\r\ngaps in the logic by which alone penalties for opinions can be defended.\r\nThe doctrine of reprobation, in the judgment of many very able men,\r\nfollows by syllogistic necessity from the doctrine of election. Others\r\nconceive that the Antinomian heresy directly follows from the doctrine\r\nof reprobation; and it is very generally thought that licentiousness and\r\ncruelty of the worst description are likely to be the fruits, as they\r\noften have been the fruits, of Antinomian opinions. This chain of\r\nreasoning, we think, is as perfect in all its parts as that which makes\r\nout a Papist to be necessarily a traitor. Yet it would be rather a\r\nstrong measure to hang all the Calvinists, on the ground that, if they\r\nwere spared, they would infallibly commit all the atrocities of Matthias\r\nand Knipperdoling. For, reason the matter as we may, experience shows\r\nus that a man may believe in election without believing in reprobation,\r\nthat he may believe in reprobation without being an Antinomian, and that\r\nhe may be an Antinomian without being a bad citizen. Man, in short,\r\nis so inconsistent a creature that it is impossible to reason from his\r\nbelief to his conduct, or from one part of his belief to another.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe that every Englishman who was reconciled to the\r\nCatholic Church would, as a necessary consequence, have thought himself\r\njustified in deposing or assassinating Elizabeth. It is not sufficient\r\nto say that the convert must have acknowledged the authority of the\r\nPope, and that the Pope had issued a {444}bull against the Queen. We\r\nknow through what strange loopholes the human mind contrives to escape,\r\nwhen it wishes to avoid a disagreeable inference from an admitted\r\nproposition. We know how long the Jansenists contrived to believe the\r\nPope infallible in matters of doctrine, and at the same time to believe\r\ndoctrines which he pronounced to be heretical. Let it pass, however,\r\nthat every Catholic in the kingdom thought that Elizabeth might be\r\nlawfully murdered. Still the old maxim, that what is the business of\r\neverybody is the business of nobody, is particularly likely to hold good\r\nin a case in which a cruel death is the almost inevitable consequence of\r\nmaking any attempt.\r\n\r\nOf the ten thousand clergymen of the Church of England, there is\r\nscarcely one who would not say that a man who should leave his country\r\nand friends to preach the Gospel among savages, and who should, after\r\nlabouring indefatigably without any hope of reward, terminate his life\r\nby martyrdom, would deserve the warmest admiration. Yet we doubt whether\r\nten of the ten thousand ever thought of going on such an expedition.\r\nWhy should we suppose that conscientious motives, feeble as they are\r\nconstantly found to be in a good cause, should be omnipotent for evil?\r\nDoubtless there was many a jolly Popish priest in the old manor-houses\r\nof the northern counties, who would have admitted, in theory, the\r\ndeposing power of the Pope, but who would not have been ambitious to be\r\nstretched on the rack, even though it were to be used, according to the\r\nbenevolent proviso of Lord Burleigh, “as charitably as such a thing can\r\nbe,” or to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, even though, by that rare\r\nindulgence which the Queen, of her special grace, certain knowledge, and\r\nmere motion, sometimes extended to very mitigated cases, he {445}were\r\nallowed a fair time to choke before the hangman began to grabble in his\r\nentrails.\r\n\r\nBut the laws passed against the Puritans had not even the wretched\r\nexcuse which we have been considering. In this case, the cruelty was\r\nequal, the danger infinitely less. In fact, the danger was created\r\nsolely by the cruelty. But it is superfluous to press the argument.\r\nBy no artifice of ingenuity can the stigma of persecution, the\r\nworst blemish of the English Church, be effaced or patched over. Her\r\ndoctrines, we well know, do not tend to intolerance. She admits the\r\npossibility of salvation out of her own pale. But this circumstance, in\r\nitself honourable to her, aggravates the sin and the shame of those\r\nwho persecuted in her name. Dominic and De Montfort did not, at least,\r\nmurder and torture for differences of opinion which they considered as\r\ntrifling. It was to stop an infection which, as they believed, hurried\r\nto certain perdition every soul which it seized, that they employed\r\ntheir fire and steel. The measures of the English government with\r\nrespect to the Papists and Puritans sprang from a widely different\r\nprinciple. If those who deny that the founders of the Church were guilty\r\nof religious persecution mean only that the founders of the Church were\r\nnot influenced by any religious motive, we perfectly agree with them.\r\nNeither the penal code of Elizabeth, nor the more hateful system by\r\nwhich Charles the Second attempted to force Episcopacy on the Scotch,\r\nhad an origin so noble. The cause is to be sought in some circumstances\r\nwhich attended the Reformation in England, circumstances of which the\r\neffects long continued to be felt, and may in some degree be traced even\r\nat the present day.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, in France, in Switzerland, and in Scotland, {446}the contest\r\nagainst the Papal power was essentially a religions contest. In all\r\nthose countries, indeed, the cause of the Reformation, like every\r\nother great cause, attracted to itself many supporters influenced by no\r\nconscientious principle, many who quitted the Established Church\r\nonly because they thought her in danger, many who were weary of her\r\nrestraints, and many who were greedy for her spoils. But it was not\r\nby these adherents that the separation was there conducted. They were\r\nwelcome auxiliaries; their support was too often purchased by unworthy\r\ncompliances; but, however exalted in rank or power, they were not the\r\nleaders in the enterprise. Men of a widely different description,\r\nmen who redeemed great infirmities and errors by sincerity,\r\ndisinterestedness, energy, and courage, men who, with many of the vices\r\nof revolutionary chiefs and of polemic divines, united some of the\r\nhighest qualities of apostles, were the real directors. They might\r\nbe violent in innovation and scurrilous in controversy. They might\r\nsometimes act with inexcusable severity towards opponents, and sometimes\r\nconnive disreputably at the vices of powerful allies. But fear was not\r\nin them, nor hypocrisy, nor avarice, nor any petty selfishness. Their\r\none great object was the demolition of the idols and the purification of\r\nthe sanctuary. If they were too indulgent to the failings of eminent men\r\nfrom whose patronage they expected advantage to the church, they\r\nnever flinched before persecuting tyrants and hostile armies. For that\r\ntheological system to which they sacrificed the lives of others without\r\nscruple, they were ready to throw away their own lives without fear.\r\nSuch were the authors of the great schism on the Continent and in the\r\nnorthern part of this island. The Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave\r\nof Hesse, the {447}Prince of Condé and the King of Navarre, the Earl of\r\nMoray and the Earl of Morton, might espouse the Protestant opinions, or\r\nmight pretend to espouse them; but it was from Luther, from Calvin, from\r\nKnox, that the Reformation took its character.\r\n\r\nEngland has no such names to show: not that she wanted men of sincere\r\npiety, of deep learning, of steady and adventurous courage. But these\r\nwere thrown into the back ground. Elsewhere men of this character were\r\nthe principals. Here they acted a secondary part. Elsewhere worldliness\r\nwas the tool of zeal. Here zeal was the tool of worldliness. A King,\r\nwhose character may be best described by saying that he was despotism\r\nitself personified, unprincipled ministers, a rapacious aristocracy,\r\na servile Parliament, such were the instruments by which England was\r\ndelivered from the yoke of Rome. The work which had been begun by Henry,\r\nthe murderer of his wives, was continued by Somerset, the murderer of\r\nhis brother, and completed by Elizabeth, the murderer of her guest.\r\nSprung from brutal passion, nurtured by selfish policy, the Reformation\r\nin England displayed little of what had, in other countries,\r\ndistinguished it, unflinching and unsparing devotion, boldness of\r\nspeech, and singleness of eye. These were indeed to be found; but it was\r\nin the lower ranks of the party which opposed the authority of Rome, in\r\nsuch men as Hooper, Latimer, Rogers, and Taylor. Of those who had any\r\nimportant share in bringing the Reformation about, Ridley was perhaps\r\nthe only person who did not consider it as a mere political job. Even\r\nRidley did not play a very prominent part. Among the statesmen and\r\nprelates who principally gave the tone to the religious changes, there\r\nis one, and one only, whose conduct partiality {448}itself can attribute\r\nto any other than interested motives. It is not strange, therefore, that\r\nhis character should have been the subject of fierce controversy. We\r\nneed not say that we speak of Cranmer.\r\n\r\nMr. Hallam has been severely censured for saying, with his usual placid\r\nseverity, that, “if we weigh the character of this prelate in an equal\r\nbalance, he will appear far indeed removed from the turpitude imputed to\r\nhim by his enemies; yet not entitled to any extraordinary veneration.”\r\n We will venture to expand the sense of Mr. Hallam, and to comment on it\r\nthus:--If we consider Cranmer merely as a statesman, he will not appear\r\na much worse man than Wolsey, Gardiner, Cromwell, or Somerset. But, when\r\nan attempt is made to set him up as a saint, it is scarcely possible\r\nfor any man of sense who knows the history of the times to preserve his\r\ngravity. If the memory of the archbishop had been left to find its own\r\nplace, he would have soon been lost among the crowd which is mingled\r\n\r\n                        “A quel cattivo coro\r\n\r\n                   Degli angeli, che non furon ribelli,\r\n\r\n                   Nè fur fedcli a Dio, nia per se foro.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the only notice which it would have been necessary to take of his\r\nname would have been\r\n\r\n               “Non ragioniam di lui; ma guarda, e passa.\"\r\n\r\nBut, since his admirers challenge for him a place in the noble army of\r\nmartyrs, his claims require fuller discussion.\r\n\r\nThe origin of his greatness, common enough in the scandalous chronicles\r\nof courts, seems strangely out of place in a hagiology. Cranmer rose\r\ninto favour by serving Henry in the disgraceful affair of his first\r\ndivorce. He promoted the marriage of Anne {449}Boleyn with the King.\r\nOn a frivolous pretence he pronounced that marriage null and void. On a\r\npretence, if possible, still more frivolous, he dissolved the ties which\r\nbound the shameless tyrant to Anne of Cleves. He attached himself to\r\nCromwell while the fortunes of Cromwell flourished. He voted for cutting\r\noff Cromwell’s head without a trial, when the tide of royal favour\r\nturned. He conformed backwards and forwards as the King changed his\r\nmind. He assisted, while Henry lived, in condemning to the flames those\r\nwho denied the doctrine of transubstantiation. He found out, as soon as\r\nHenry was dead, that the doctrine was false. He was, however, not at a\r\nloss for people to burn. The authority of his station and of his grey\r\nhairs was employed to overcome the disgust with which an intelligent and\r\nvirtuous child regarded persecution. Intolerance is always bad. But the\r\nsanguinary intolerance of a man who thus wavered in his creed excites\r\na loathing, to which it is difficult to give vent without calling foul\r\nnames. Equally false to political and to religious obligations,\r\nthe primate was first the tool of Somerset, and then the tool of\r\nNorthumberland. When the Protector wished to put his own brother\r\nto death, without even the semblance of a trial, he found a ready\r\ninstrument in Cranmer. In spite of the canon law, which forbade a\r\nchurchman to take any part in matters of blood, the archbishop signed\r\nthe warrant for the atrocious sentence. When Somerset had been in his\r\nturn destroyed, his destroyer received the support of Cranmer in a\r\nwicked attempt to change the course of the succession.\r\n\r\nThe apology made for him by his admirers only renders his conduct more\r\ncontemptible. He complied, it is said, against his better judgment,\r\nbecause he could {450}not resist the entreaties of Edward. A holy\r\nprelate of sixty, one would think, might be better employed by the\r\nbedside of a dying child, than in committing crimes at the request of\r\nthe young disciple. If Cranmer had shown half as much firmness when\r\nEdward requested him to commit treason as he had before shown when\r\nEdward requested him not to commit murder, he might have saved the\r\ncountry from one of the greatest misfortunes that it ever underwent. He\r\nbecame, from whatever motive, the accomplice of the worthless Dudley.\r\nThe virtuous scruples of another young and amiable mind were to be\r\novercome. As Edward had been forced into persecution, Jane was to be\r\nseduced into treason. No transaction in our annals is more unjustifiable\r\nthan this. If a hereditary title were to be respected, Mary possessed\r\nit. If a parliamentary title were preferable, Mary possessed that also.\r\nIf the interest of the Protestant religion required a departure from the\r\nordinary rule of succession, that interest would have been best served\r\nby raising Elizabeth to the throne. If the foreign relations of the\r\nkingdom were considered, still stronger reasons might be found for\r\npreferring Elizabeth to Jane. There was great doubt whether Jane or the\r\nQueen of Scotland had the better claim; and that doubt would, in all\r\nprobability, have produced a war both with Scotland and with France, if\r\nthe project of Northumberland had not been blasted in its infancy.\r\nThat Elizabeth had a better claim than the Queen of Scotland was\r\nindisputable. To the part which Cranmer, and unfortunately some better\r\nmen than Cranmer, took in this most reprehensible scheme, much of the\r\nseverity with which the Protestants were afterwards treated must in\r\nfairness be ascribed. {451}The plot failed; Popery triumphed; and\r\nCranmer recanted. Most people look on his recantation as a single\r\nblemish on an honourable life, the frailty of an unguarded moment. But,\r\nin fact, his recantation was in strict accordance with the system on\r\nwhich he had constantly acted. It was part of a regular habit. It was\r\nnot the first recantation that he had made; and, in all probability, if\r\nit had answered its purpose, it would not have been the last. We do\r\nnot blame him for not choosing to be burned alive. It is no very severe\r\nreproach to any person that he does not possess heroic fortitude. But\r\nsurely a man who liked the fire so little should have had some sympathy\r\nfor others. A persecutor who inflicts nothing which he is not ready to\r\nendure deserves some respect. But when a man who loves his doctrines\r\nmore than the lives of his neighbours loves his own little finger better\r\nthan his doctrines, a very simple argument _a fortiori_ will enable us\r\nto estimate the amount of his benevolence.\r\n\r\nBut his martyrdom, it is said, redeemed every thing. It is extraordinary\r\nthat so much ignorance should exist on this subject. The fact is that,\r\nif a martyr be a man who chooses to die rather than to renounce his\r\nopinions, Cranmer was no more a martyr than Dr. Dodd. He died, solely\r\nbecause he could not help it. He never retracted his recantation till\r\nhe found he had made it in vain. The Queen was fully resolved that,\r\nCatholic or Protestant, he should burn. Then he spoke out, as people\r\ngenerally speak out when they are at the point of death and have nothing\r\nto hope or to fear on earth. If Mary had suffered him to live, we\r\nsuspect that he would have heard mass and received absolution, like a\r\ngood Catholic, till the accession of Elizabeth, and that he would then\r\nhave purchased, by {452}another apostasy, the power of burning men\r\nbetter and braver than himself.\r\n\r\nWe do not mean, however, to represent him as a monster of wickedness.\r\nHe was not wantonly cruel or treacherous. He was merely a supple, timid,\r\ninterested courtier, in times of frequent and violent change. That which\r\nhas always been represented as his distinguishing virtue, the facility\r\nwith which he forgave his enemies, belongs to the character. Slaves of\r\nhis class are never vindictive, and never grateful. A present interest\r\neffaces past services and past injuries from their minds together. Their\r\nonly object is self-preservation; and for this they conciliate those who\r\nwrong them, just as they abandon those who serve them. Before we extol\r\na man for his forgiving temper, we should inquire whether he is above\r\nrevenge, or below it.\r\n\r\nSomerset had as little principle as his coadjutor. Of Henry, an orthodox\r\nCatholic, except that he chose to be his own Pope, and of Elizabeth, who\r\ncertainly had no objection to the theology of Rome, we need say nothing.\r\nThese four persons were the great authors of the English Reformation.\r\nThree of them had a direct interest in the extension of the royal\r\nprerogative. The fourth was the ready tool of any who could frighten\r\nhim. It is not difficult to see from what motives, and on what plan,\r\nsuch persons would be inclined to remodel the Church. The scheme\r\nwas merely to transfer the full cup of sorceries from the Babylonian\r\nenchantress to other hands, spilling as little as possible by the way.\r\nThe Catholic doctrines and rites were to be retained in the Church of\r\nEngland. But the King was to exercise the control which had formerly\r\nbelonged to the Roman Pontiff. In this {453}Henry for a time succeeded.\r\nThe extraordinary force of his character, the fortunate situation in\r\nwhich he stood with respect to foreign powers, and the vast resources\r\nwhich the suppression of the monasteries placed at his disposal, enabled\r\nhim to oppress both the religious factions equally. He punished with\r\nimpartial severity those who renounced the doctrines of Rome, and those\r\nwho acknowledged her jurisdiction. The basis, however, on which he\r\nattempted to establish his power was too narrow to be durable. It would\r\nhave been impossible even for him long to persecute both persuasions.\r\nEven under his reign there had been insurrections on the part of the\r\nCatholics, and signs of a spirit which was likely soon to produce\r\ninsurrection on the part of the Protestants. It was plainly necessary,\r\ntherefore, that the Crown should form an alliance with one or with the\r\nother side. To recognise the Papal supremacy, would have been to abandon\r\nthe whole design. Reluctantly and sullenly the government at last joined\r\nthe Protestants. In forming this junction, its object was to procure\r\nas much aid as possible for its selfish undertaking, and to make the\r\nsmallest possible concessions to the spirit of religious innovation.\r\n\r\nFrom this compromise the Church of England sprang. In many respects,\r\nindeed, it has been well for her that, in an age of exuberant zeal, her\r\nprincipal founders were mere politicians. To this circumstance she owes\r\nher moderate articles, her decent ceremonies, her noble and pathetic\r\nliturgy. Her worship is not disfigured by mummery. Yet she has\r\npreserved, in a far greater degree than any of her Protestant sisters,\r\nthat art of striking the senses and filling the imagination in which the\r\nCatholic Church so eminently excels. But, on the {454}other hand, she\r\ncontinued, to be, for more than a hundred and fifty years, the servile\r\nhandmaid of monarchy, the steady enemy of public liberty. The divine\r\nright of kings, and the duty of passively obeying all their commands,\r\nwere her favourite tenets. She held those tenets firmly through times\r\nof oppression, persecution, and licentiousness; while law was trampled\r\ndown; while judgment was perverted; while the people were eaten as\r\nthough they were bread. Once, and but once, for a moment, and but for\r\na moment, when her own dignity and property were touched, she forgot to\r\npractise the submission which she had taught.\r\n\r\nElizabeth clearly discerned the advantages which were to be derived from\r\na close connection between the monarchy and the priesthood. At the\r\ntime of her accession, indeed, she evidently meditated a partial\r\nreconciliation with Rome; and, throughout her whole life, she leaned\r\nstrongly to some of the most obnoxious parts of the Catholic system.\r\nBut her imperious temper, her keen sagacity, and her peculiar situation,\r\nsoon led her to attach herself completely to a church which was all\r\nher own. On the same principle on which she joined it, she attempted to\r\ndrive all her people within its pale by persecution. She supported it by\r\nsevere penal laws, not because she thought conformity to its discipline\r\nnecessary to salvation; but because it was the fastness which arbitrary\r\npower was making strong for itself; because she expected a more\r\nprofound obedience from those who saw in her both their civil and their\r\necclesiastical chief, than from those who, like the Papists, ascribe\r\nspiritual authority to the Pope, or from those who, like some of the\r\nPuritans, ascribed it only to Heaven. To dissent from her establishment\r\nwas to dissent from an institution founded with {455}an express view to\r\nthe maintenance and extension of the royal prerogative.\r\n\r\nThis great Queen and her successors, by considering conformity and\r\nloyalty as identical, at length made them so. With respect to the\r\nCatholics, indeed, the rigour of persecution abated after her death.\r\nJames soon found that they were unable to injure him, and that the\r\nanimosity which the Puritan party felt towards them drove them of\r\nnecessity to take refuge under his throne. During the subsequent\r\nconflict, their fault was anything but disloyalty. On the other hand,\r\nJames hated the Puritans with more than the hatred of Elizabeth. Her\r\naversion to them was political; his was personal. The sect had plagued\r\nhim in Scotland, where he was weak; and he was determined to be even\r\nwith them in England, where he was powerful. Persecution gradually\r\nchanged a sect into a faction. That there was anything in the religious\r\nopinions of the Puritans which rendered them hostile to monarchy has\r\nnever been proved to our satisfaction. After our civil contests, it\r\nbecame the fashion to say that Presbyterianism was connected with\r\nRepublicanism; just as it has been the fashion to say, since the time of\r\nthe French Revolution, that Infidelity is connected with Republicanism.\r\nIt is perfectly true that a church, constituted on the Calvinistic\r\nmodel, will not strengthen the hands of the sovereign so much as a\r\nhierarchy which consists of several ranks, differing in dignity and\r\nemolument, and of which all the members are constantly looking to\r\nthe government for promotion. But experience has clearly shown that a\r\nCalvinistic church, like every other church, is disaffected when it is\r\npersecuted, quiet when it is tolerated, and actively loyal when it\r\nis favoured and cherished. Scotland has had a Presbyterian\r\n{456}establishment during a century and a half. Yet her General\r\nAssembly has not, during that period, given half so much trouble to the\r\ngovernment as the Convocation of the Church of England gave during\r\nthe thirty years which followed the Revolution. That James and Charles\r\nshould have been mistaken in this point is not surprising. But we are\r\nastonished, we must confess, that men of our own time, men who have\r\nbefore them the proof of what toleration can effect, men who may see\r\nwith their own eyes that the Presbyterians are no such monsters\r\nwhen government is wise enough to let them alone, should defend the\r\npersecutions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as indispensable\r\nto the safety of the church and the throne.\r\n\r\nHow persecution protects churches and thrones was soon made manifest.\r\nA systematic political opposition, vehement, daring, and inflexible,\r\nsprang from a schism about trifles, altogether unconnected with the real\r\ninterests of religion or of the state. Before the close of the reign\r\nof Elizabeth this opposition began to show itself It broke forth on the\r\nquestion of the monopolies. Even the imperial Lioness was compelled\r\nto abandon her prey, and slowly and fiercely to recede before the\r\nassailants. The spirit of liberty grew with the growing wealth and\r\nintelligence of the people. The feeble struggles and insults of James\r\nirritated instead of suppressing it; and the events which immediately\r\nfollowed the accession of his son portended a contest of no common\r\nseverity, between a king resolved to be absolute, and a people resolved\r\nto be free.\r\n\r\nThe famous proceedings of the third Parliament of Charles, and the\r\ntyrannical measures which followed its dissolution, are extremely well\r\ndescribed by Mr. Hal-lam. No writer, we think, has shown, in so clear\r\nand {457}satisfactory a manner, that the Government then entertained\r\na fixed purpose of destroying the old parliamentary constitution\r\nof England, or at least of reducing it to a mere shadow. We hasten,\r\nhowever, to a part of his work which, though it abounds in valuable\r\ninformation and in remarks well deserving to be attentively considered,\r\nand though it is, like the rest, evidently written in a spirit of\r\nperfect impartiality, appears to us, in many points, objectionable.\r\n\r\nWe pass to the year 1640. The fate of the short Parliament held in\r\nthat year clearly indicated the views of the King. That a parliament so\r\nmoderate in feeling should have met after so many years of oppression\r\nis truly wonderful. Hyde extols its loyal and conciliatory spirit. Its\r\nconduct, we are told, made the excellent Falkland in love with the very\r\nname of Parliament. We think, indeed, with Oliver St. John, that its\r\nmoderation was carried too far, and that the times required sharper\r\nand more decided councils. It was fortunate, however, that the King\r\nhad another opportunity of showing that hatred of the liberties of his\r\nsubjects which was the ruling principle of all his conduct. The sole\r\ncrime of the Commons was that, meeting after a long intermission of\r\nparliaments, and after a long series of cruelties and illegal imposts,\r\nthey seemed inclined to examine grievances before they would vote\r\nsupplies. For this insolence they were dissolved almost as soon as they\r\nmet.\r\n\r\nDefeat, universal agitation, financial embarrassments, disorganization\r\nin every part of the government, compelled Charles again to convene the\r\nHouses before the close of the same year. Their meeting was one of the\r\ngreat eras in the history of the civilised world. Whatever of political\r\nfreedom exists either in Europe or in {458}America, has sprung, directly\r\nor indirectly, from those institutions which they secured and reformed.\r\nWe never turn to the annals of those times without feeling increased\r\nadmiration of the patriotism, the energy, the decision, the consummate\r\nwisdom, which marked the measures of that great Parliament, from the day\r\non which it met to the commencement of civil hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe impeachment of Strafford was the first, and perhaps the greatest\r\nblow. The whole conduct of that celebrated man proved that he had formed\r\na deliberate scheme to subvert the fundamental laws of England. Those\r\nparts of his correspondence which have been brought to light since his\r\ndeath place the matter beyond a doubt. One of his admirers has, indeed,\r\noffered to show “that the passages which Mr. Hallam has invidiously\r\nextracted from the correspondence between Laud and Strafford, as proving\r\ntheir design to introduce a thorough tyranny, refer not to any such\r\ndesign, but to a thorough reform in the affairs of state, and the\r\nthorough maintenance of just authority.” We will recommend two or three\r\nof these passages to the especial notice of our readers.\r\n\r\nAll who know anything of those times, know that the conduct of Hampden\r\nin the affair of the ship-money met with the warm approbation of every\r\nrespectable Royalist in England. It drew forth the ardent eulogies\r\nof the champions of the prerogative and even of the Crown lawyers\r\nthemselves. Clarendon allows Hampden’s demeanour through the whole\r\nproceeding to have been such, that even those who watched for an\r\noccasion against the defender of the people, were compelled to\r\nacknowledge themselves unable to find any fault in him. That he was\r\nright in the point of law is now universally admitted. Even {459}had it\r\nbeen otherwise, he had a fair case. Five of the Judges, servile as our\r\nCourts then were, pronounced in his favour. The majority against him was\r\nthe smallest possible. In no country retaining the slightest vestige\r\nof constitutional liberty can a modest and decent appeal to the laws be\r\ntreated as a crime. Stratford, however, recommends that, for taking\r\nthe sense of a legal tribunal on a legal question, Hampden should be\r\npunished, and punished severely, “whipt,” says the insolent apostate,\r\n“whipt into his senses. If the rod,” he adds, “be so used that it smarts\r\nnot, I am the more sorry.” This is the maintenance of just authority.\r\n\r\nIn civilised nations, the most arbitrary governments have generally\r\nsuffered justice to have a free course in private suits. Strafford\r\nwished to make every cause in every court subject to the royal\r\nprerogative. He complained that in Ireland he was not permitted to\r\nmeddle in cases between party and party. “I know very well,” says he,\r\n“that the common lawyers will be passionately against it, who are wont\r\nto put such a prejudice upon all other professions, as if none were to\r\nbe trusted, or capable to administer justice, but themselves; yet how\r\nwell this suits with monarchy, when they monopolise all to be governed\r\nby their yearbooks, you in England have a costly example.” We are really\r\ncurious to know by what arguments it is to be proved, that the power of\r\ninterfering in the lawsuits of individuals is part of the just authority\r\nof the executive government.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that a man so careless of the common civil rights,\r\nwhich even despots have generally respected, should treat with scorn the\r\nlimitations which the constitution imposes on the royal prerogative.\r\nWe might quote pages: but we will content ourselves with {460}a single\r\nspecimen:--“The debts of the Crown being taken off, you may govern as\r\nyou please: and most resolute I am that may be done without borrowing\r\nany help forth of the King’s lodgings.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the theory of that thorough reform in the state which Strafford\r\nmeditated. His whole practice, from the day on which he sold himself to\r\nthe court, was in strict conformity to his theory. For his accomplices\r\nvarious excuses may be urged, ignorance, imbecility, religious bigotry.\r\nBut Wentworth had no such plea. His intellect was capacious. His early\r\nprepossessions were on the side of popular rights. He knew the whole\r\nbeauty and value of the system which he attempted to deface. He was the\r\nfirst of the Rats, the first of those statesmen whose patriotism has\r\nbeen only the coquetry of political prostitution, and whose profligacy\r\nhas taught governments to adopt the old maxim of the slave-market,\r\nthat it is cheaper to buy than to breed, to import defenders from an\r\nOpposition than to rear them in a Ministry. He was the first Englishman\r\nto whom a peerage was a sacrament of infamy, a baptism into the\r\ncommunion of corruption. As he was the earliest of the hateful list,\r\nso was he also by far the greatest; eloquent, sagacious, adventurous,\r\nintrepid, ready of invention, immutable of purpose, in every talent\r\nwhich exalts or destroys nations preeminent, the lost Archangel,\r\nthe Satan of the apostasy. The title for which, at the time of his\r\ndesertion, he exchanged a name honourably distinguished in the cause of\r\nthe people, reminds us of the appellation which, from the moment of the\r\nfirst treason, fixed itself on the fallen Son of the Morning,\r\n\r\n                   Satan;--so call him now.--His former name\r\n\r\n                   Is heard no more in heaven.\"  {461}The defection of Strafford from\r\nthe popular party contributed mainly to draw on him the hatred of his\r\ncontemporaries. It has since made him an object of peculiar interest to\r\nthose whose lives have been spent, like his, in proving that there is\r\nno malice like the malice of a renegade. Nothing can be more natural or\r\nbecoming than that one turncoat should eulogize another.\r\n\r\nMany enemies of public liberty have been distinguished by their private\r\nvirtues. But Strafford was the same throughout. As was the statesman,\r\nsuch was the kinsman, and such the lover. His conduct towards Lord\r\nMountmorris is recorded by Clarendon. For a word which can scarcely be\r\ncalled rash, which could not have been made the subject of an ordinary\r\ncivil action, the Lord Lieutenant dragged a man of high rank, married to\r\na relative of that saint about whom he whimpered to the Peers, before a\r\ntribunal of slaves. Sentence of death was passed. Every thing but death\r\nwas inflicted. Yet the treatment which Lord Ely experienced was still\r\nmore scandalous. That nobleman was thrown into prison, in order\r\nto compel him to settle his estate in a manner agreeable to his\r\ndaughter-in-law, whom, as there is every reason to believe, Strafford\r\nhad debauched. These stories do not rest on vague report. The historians\r\nmost partial to the minister admit their truth, and censure them in\r\nterms which, though too lenient for the occasion, are still severe.\r\nThese facts are alone sufficient to justify the appellation with which\r\nPym branded him, “the wicked Earl.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of all Strafford’s vices, in spite of all his dangerous\r\nprojects, he was certainly entitled to the benefit of the law; but\r\nof the law in all its rigour; of {462}the law according to the utmost\r\nstrictness of the letter, which killeth. He was not to be torn in pieces\r\nby a mob, or stabbed in the back by an assassin. He was not to have\r\npunishment meted out to him from his own iniquitous measure. But if\r\njustice, in the whole range of its wide armoury, contained one weapon\r\nwhich could pierce him, that weapon his pursuers were bound, before God\r\nand man, to employ.\r\n\r\n                        ----“If he may\r\n\r\n                   Find mercy in the law, ’tis his: if none,\r\n\r\n                   Let him not seek’t of us.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the language which the Commons might o o o justly use.\r\n\r\nDid then the articles against Strafford strictly amount to high treason?\r\nMany people, who know neither what the articles were, nor what high\r\ntreason is, will answer in the negative, simply because the accused\r\nperson, speaking for his life, took that ground of defence. The Journals\r\nof the Lords show that the Judges were consulted. They answered, with\r\none accord, that the articles on which the Earl was convicted, amounted\r\nto high treason. This judicial opinion, even if we suppose it to\r\nhave been erroneous, goes far to justify the Parliament. The judgment\r\npronounced in the Exchequer Chamber has always been urged by the\r\napologists of Charles in defence of his conduct respecting ship-money.\r\nYet on that occasion there was but a bare majority in favour of the\r\nparty at whose pleasure all the magistrates composing the tribunal were\r\nremovable. The decision in the case of Strafford was unanimous; as far\r\nas we can judge, it was unbiassed; and, though there may be room for\r\nhesitation, we think on the whole that it was reasonable. “It may be\r\nremarked,” says Mr. Hallam, “that the fifteenth article {463}of the\r\nimpeachment, charging Strafford with raising money by his own authority,\r\nand quartering troops on the people of Ireland, in order to compel their\r\nobedience to his unlawful requisitions, upon which, and upon one other\r\narticle, not upon the whole matter, the Peers voted him guilty, does,\r\nat least, approach very nearly, if we may not say more, to a substantive\r\ntreason within the statute of Edward the Third, as a levying of war\r\nagainst the king.” This most sound and just exposition has provoked\r\na very ridiculous reply. “It should seem to be an Irish construction\r\nthis,” says an assailant of Mr. Hallam, “which makes the raising money\r\nfor the King’s service, with his knowledge, and by his approbation, to\r\ncome under the head of levying war on the King, and therefore to be high\r\ntreason.” Now, people who undertake to write on points of constitutional\r\nlaw should know, what every attorney’s clerk and every forward schoolboy\r\non an upper form knows, that, by a fundamental maxim of our polity, the\r\nKing can do no wrong; that every court is bound to suppose his conduct\r\nand his sentiments to be, on every occasion, such as they ought to be;\r\nand that no evidence can be received for the purpose of setting aside\r\nthis loyal and salutary presumption. The Lords, therefore, were bound to\r\ntake it for granted that the King considered arms which were unlawfully\r\ndirected against his people as directed against his own throne.\r\n\r\nThe remarks of Mr. Hallam on the bill of attainder, though, as\r\nusual, weighty and acute, do not perfectly satisfy us. He defends the\r\nprinciple, but objects to the severity of the punishment. That, on great\r\nemergencies, the State may justifiably pass a retrospective act against\r\nan offender, we have no doubt whatever. We are acquainted with only one\r\nargument on the other side, {464}which lias in it enough of reason to\r\nhear an answer. Warning, it is said, is the end of punishment. But\r\na punishment inflicted, not by a general rule, but by an arbitrary\r\ndiscretion, cannot serve the purpose of a warning. It is therefore\r\nuseless; and useless pain ought not to be inflicted. This sophism\r\nhas found its way into several books on penal legislation. It admits,\r\nhowever, of a very simple refutation. In the first place, punishments\r\n_ex post facto_ are not altogether useless even as warnings. They are\r\nwarnings to a particular class which stand in great need of warnings, to\r\nfavourites and ministers. They remind persons of this description that\r\nthere may be a day of reckoning for those who ruin and enslave their\r\ncountry in all the forms of law. But this is not all. Warning is, in\r\nordinary cases, the principal end of punishment; but it is not the only\r\nend. To remove the offender, to preserve society from those dangers\r\nwhich are to be apprehended from his incorrigible depravity is often one\r\nof the ends. In the case of such a knave as Wild, or such a ruffian\r\nas Thurtell, it is a very important end. In the case of a powerful and\r\nwicked statesman, it is infinitely more important; so important, as\r\nalone to justify the utmost severity, even though it were certain that\r\nhis fate would not deter others from imitating his example. At present,\r\nindeed, we should think it extremely pernicious to take such a course,\r\neven with a worse minister than Strafford, if a worse could exist; for,\r\nat present, Parliament has only to withhold its support from a Cabinet\r\nto produce an immediate change of hands. The case was widely different\r\nin the reign of Charles the First. That Prince had governed during\r\neleven years without any Parliament; and, even when Parliament\r\nwas sitting, had supported Buckingham against its most violent\r\nremonstrances. {465}Mr. Hallam is of opinion that a bill of pains and\r\npenalties ought to have been passed; but he draws a distinction less\r\njust, we think, than his distinctions usually are. His opinion, so far\r\nas we can collect it, is this, that there are almost insurmountable\r\nobjections to retrospective laws for capital punishment, but that, where\r\nthe punishment stops short of death, the objections are comparatively\r\ntrifling. Now the practice of taking the severity of the penalty into\r\nconsideration, when the question is about the mode of procedure and the\r\nrules of evidence, is no doubt sufficiently common. We often see a\r\nman convicted of a simple larceny on evidence on which he would not be\r\nconvicted of a burglary. It sometimes happens that a jury, when there\r\nis strong suspicion, but not absolute demonstration, that an act,\r\nunquestionably amounting to murder, was committed by the prisoner before\r\nthem, will find him guilty of manslaughter. But this is surely very\r\nirrational. The rules of evidence no more depend on the magnitude of the\r\ninterests at stake than the rules of arithmetic. We might as well say\r\nthat we have a greater chance of throwing a size when we are playing for\r\na penny than when we are playing for a thousand pounds, as that a form\r\nof trial which is sufficient for the purposes of justice, in a matter\r\naffecting liberty and property, is insufficient in a matter affecting\r\nlife. Nay, if a mode of proceeding be too lax for capital cases, it\r\nis, _à fortiori_, too lax for all others; for, in capital cases, the\r\nprinciples of human nature will always afford considerable security.\r\nNo judge is so cruel as he who indemnifies himself for scrupulosity\r\nin cases of blood, by license in affairs of smaller importance. The\r\ndifference in tale on the one side far more than makes up for the\r\ndifference in weight on the other. {466}If there be any universal\r\nobjection to retrospective punishment, there is no more to be said.\r\nBut such is not the opinion of Mr. Hallam. He approves of the mode of\r\nproceeding. He thinks that a punishment, not previously affixed by law\r\nto the offences of Strafford, should have been inflicted; that Strafford\r\nshould have been, by act of Parliament, degraded from his rank, and\r\ncondemned to perpetual banishment. Our difficulty would have been at\r\nthe first step, and there only. Indeed we can scarcely conceive that any\r\ncase which does not call for capital punishment can call for punishment\r\nby a retrospective act. We can scarcely conceive a man so wicked and\r\nso dangerous that the whole course of law must be disturbed in order to\r\nreach him, yet not so wicked as to deserve the severest sentence, nor so\r\ndangerous as to require the last and surest custody, that of the grave.\r\nIf we had thought that Strafford might be safely suffered to live in\r\nFrance, we should have thought it better that he should continue to\r\nlive in England, than that he should be exiled by a special act. As to\r\ndegradation, it was not the Earl, but the general and the statesman,\r\nwhom the people had to fear. Essex said, on that occasion, with more\r\ntruth than elegance, “Stone dead hath no fellow.” And often during the\r\ncivil wars the Parliament had reason to rejoice that an irreversible law\r\nand an impassable barrier protected them from the valour and capacity of\r\nWentworth.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that neither Hyde nor Falkland voted against the bill\r\nof attainder. There is, indeed, reason to believe that Falkland spoke in\r\nfavour of it. In one respect, as Mr. Hallam has observed, the proceeding\r\nwas honourably distinguished from others of the same kind. An act was\r\npassed to relieve the children {467}of Strafford from the forfeiture and\r\ncorruption of blood which were the legal consequences of the sentence.\r\nThe Crown had never shown equal generosity in a case of treason. The\r\nliberal conduct of the Commons has been fully and most appropriately\r\nrepaid. The House of Wentworth has since that time been as much\r\ndistinguished by public spirit as by power and splendour, and may at\r\nthe present moment boast of members with whom Say and Hampden would have\r\nbeen proud to act.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat curious that the admirers of Strafford should also be,\r\nwithout a single exception, the admirers of Charles; for, whatever\r\nwe may think of the conduct of the Parliament towards the unhappy\r\nfavourite, there can be no doubt that the treatment which he received\r\nfrom his master was disgraceful. Faithless alike to his people and to\r\nhis tools, the King did not scruple to play the part of the cowardly\r\napprover, who hangs his accomplice. It is good that there should be such\r\nmen as Charles in every league of villany. It is for such men that the\r\noffer of pardon and reward which appears after a murder is intended.\r\nThey are indemnified, remunerated, and despised. The very magistrate who\r\navails himself of their assistance looks on them as more contemptible\r\nthan the criminal whom they betray. Was Strafford innocent? Was he a\r\nmeritorious servant of the Crown? If so, what shall we think of the\r\nPrince, who having solemnly promised him that not a hair of his head\r\nshould be hurt, and possessing an unquestioned constitutional right to\r\nsave him, gave him up to the vengeance of his enemies? There were some\r\npoints which we know that Charles would not concede, and for which he\r\nwas willing to risk the chances of civil war. Ought o {468}not a King,\r\nwho will make a stand for any thing, to make a stand for the innocent\r\nblood? Was Strafford guilty? Even on this supposition, it is difficult\r\nnot to feel disdain for the partner of his guilt, the tempter turned\r\npunisher. If, indeed, from that time forth, the conduct of Charles\r\nhad been blameless, it might have been said that his eyes were at last\r\nopened to the errors of his former conduct, and that, in sacrificing to\r\nthe wishes of his Parliament a minister whose crime had been a devotion\r\ntoo zealous to the interests of his prerogative, he gave a painful and\r\ndeeply humiliating proof of the sincerity of his repentance. We may\r\ndescribe the King’s behaviour on this occasion in terms resembling those\r\nwhich Hume has employed when speaking of the conduct of Churchill at the\r\nRevolution. It required ever after the most rigid justice and sincerity\r\nin the dealings of Charles with his people to vindicate his conduct\r\ntowards his friend. His subsequent dealings with his people, however,\r\nclearly showed, that it was not from any respect for the Constitution,\r\nor from any sense of the deep criminality of the plans in which\r\nStrafford and himself had been engaged, that he gave up his minister to\r\nthe axe. It became evident that he had abandoned a servant who, deeply\r\nguilty as to all others, was guiltless to him alone, solely in order to\r\ngain time for maturing other schemes of tyranny, and purchasing the aid\r\nof other Wentworths. He, who would not avail himself of the power which\r\nthe laws gave him to save an adherent to whom his honour was pledged,\r\nsoon showed that he did not scruple to break every law and forfeit every\r\npledge, in order to work the ruin of his opponents.\r\n\r\n“Put not your trust in princes!” was the expression of the fallen\r\nminister, when he heard that Charles {469}had consented to his death.\r\nThe whole history of the times is a sermon on that bitter text. The\r\ndefence of the Long Parliament is comprised in the dying words of its\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nThe early measures of that Parliament Mr. Hallam in general approves.\r\nBut he considers the proceedings which took place after the recess in\r\nthe summer of 1641 as mischievous and violent. He thinks that, from\r\nthat time, the demands of the Houses were not warranted by any imminent\r\ndanger to the Constitution, and that in the war which ensued they were\r\nclearly the aggressors. As this is one of the most interesting questions\r\nin our history, we will venture to state, at some length, the reasons\r\nwhich have led us to form an opinion on it contrary to that of a writer\r\nwhose judgment we so highly respect.\r\n\r\nWe will premise that we think worse of King Charles the First than even\r\nMr. Hallam appears to do. The fixed hatred of liberty which was the\r\nprinciple of the King’s public conduct, the unscrupulousness with which\r\nhe adopted any means which might enable him to attain his ends, the\r\nreadiness with which he gave promises, the impudence with which he broke\r\nthem, the cruel indifference with which he threw away his useless or\r\ndamaged tools, made him, at least till his character was fully exposed\r\nand his power shaken to its foundations, a more dangerous enemy to the\r\nConstitution than a man of far greater talents and resolution might\r\nhave been. Such princes may still be seen, the scandals of the southern\r\nthrones of Europe, princes false alike to the accomplices who have\r\nserved them and to the opponents who have spared them, princes who, in\r\nthe hour of danger, concede every thing, swear every thing, hold\r\nout their cheeks to every smiter, give {470}up to punishment\r\nevery instrument of their tyranny, and await with meek and smiling\r\nimplacability the blessed day of perjury and revenge.\r\n\r\nWe will pass by the instances of oppression and falsehood which\r\ndisgraced the early part of the reign of Charles. We will leave out of\r\nthe question the whole history of his third Parliament, the price which\r\nhe exacted for assenting to the Petition of Right, the perfidy with\r\nwhich he violated his engagements, the death of Eliot, the barbarous\r\npunishments inflicted by the Star-Chamber, the ship-money, and all the\r\nmeasures now universally condemned, which disgraced his administration\r\nfrom 1630 to 1640. We will admit that it might be the duty of the\r\nParliament, after punishing the most guilty of his creatures, after\r\nabolishing the inquisitorial tribunals which had been the instruments\r\nof his tyranny, after reversing the unjust sentences of his victims, to\r\npause in its course. The concessions which had been made were great, the\r\nevils of civil war obvious, the advantages even of victory doubtful. The\r\nformer errors of the King might be imputed to youth, to the pressure of\r\ncircumstances, to the influence of evil counsel, to the undefined state\r\nof the law. We firmly believe that if, even at this eleventh hour,\r\nCharles had acted fairly towards his people, if he had even acted fairly\r\ntowards his own partisans, the House of Commons would have given him a\r\nfair chance of retrieving the public confidence. Such was the opinion of\r\nClarendon. He distinctly states that the fury of opposition had abated,\r\nthat a reaction had begun to take place, that the majority of those\r\nwho had taken part against the King were desirous of an honourable\r\nand complete reconciliation, and that the more violent, or, as it soon\r\nappeared, the more judicious members of {471}the popular party were\r\nfast declining in credit. The Remonstrance had been carried with\r\ngreat difficulty. The uncompromising antagonists of the court, such\r\nas Cromwell, had begun to talk of selling their estates and leaving\r\nEngland. The event soon showed, that they were the only men who\r\nreally understood how much inhumanity and fraud lay hid under the\r\nconstitutional language and gracious demeanour of the King.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to seize the five members was undoubtedly the real cause of\r\nthe war. From that moment, the loyal confidence with which most of the\r\npopular party were beginning to regard the King was turned into hatred\r\nand incurable suspicion. From that moment, the Parliament was compelled\r\nto surround itself with defensive arms. From that moment, the city\r\nassumed the appearance of a garrison. From that moment, in the phrase\r\nof Clarendon, the carriage of Hampden became fiercer, that he drew the\r\nsword and threw away the scabbard. For, from that moment, it must\r\nhave been evident to every impartial observer that, in the midst of\r\nprofessions, oaths, and smiles, the tyrant was constantly looking\r\nforward to an absolute sway and to a bloody revenge.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of Charles have very dexterously contrived to conceal from\r\ntheir readers the real nature of this transaction. By making concessions\r\napparently candid and ample, they elude the great accusation. They allow\r\nthat the measure was weak and even frantic, an absurd caprice of Lord\r\nDigby, absurdly adopted by the King. And thus they save their client\r\nfrom the full penalty of his transgression, by entering a plea of guilty\r\nto the minor offence. To us his conduct appears at this day as at the\r\ntime it appeared to the Parliament and the city. We think it by no means\r\nso foolish {472}as it pleases his friends to represent it, and far more\r\nwicked.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the transaction was illegal from beginning to end.\r\nThe impeachment was illegal. The process was illegal. The service was\r\nillegal. If Charles wished to prosecute the five members for treason, a\r\nhill against them should have been sent to a grand jury. That a commoner\r\ncannot be tried for high treason by the Lords, at the suit of the Crown,\r\nis part of the very alphabet of our law. That no man can be arrested by\r\nthe King in person is equally clear. This was an established maxim of\r\nour jurisprudence even in the time of Edward the Fourth. “A subject,”\r\n said Chief Justice Markham to that Prince, “may arrest for treason:\r\nthe King cannot; for, if the arrest be illegal, the party has no remedy\r\nagainst the King.”\r\n\r\nThe time at which Charles took this step also deserves consideration. We\r\nhave already said that the ardour which the Parliament had displayed at\r\nthe time of its first meeting had considerably abated, that the leading\r\nopponents of the court were desponding, and that their followers were\r\nin general inclined to milder and more temper» measures than those which\r\nhad hitherto been pursued. In every country, and in none more than\r\nin England, there is a disposition to take the part of those who are\r\nunmercifully run down and who seem destitute of all means of defence.\r\nEvery man who has observed the ebb and flow of public feeling in our own\r\ntime will easily recall examples to illustrate this remark. An English\r\nstatesman ought to pay assiduous worship to Nemesis, to be most\r\napprehensive of ruin when he is at the height of power and popularity,\r\nand to dread his enemy most when most completely prostrated. The fate of\r\nthe Coalition Ministry in 1784 {473}is perhaps the strongest instance in\r\nour history of the operation of this principle. A few weeks turned\r\nthe ablest and most extended Ministry that ever existed into a feeble\r\nOpposition, and raised a King who was talking of retiring to Hanover to\r\na height of power which none of his predecessors had enjoyed since the\r\nRevolution. A crisis of this description was evidently approaching in\r\n1642. At such a crisis, a Prince of a really honest and generous nature,\r\nwho had erred, who had seen his error, who had regretted the lost\r\naffections of his people, who rejoiced in the dawning hope of regaining\r\nthem, would be peculiarly careful to take no step which could give\r\noccasion of offence, even to the unreasonable. On the other hand, a\r\ntyrant, whose whole life was a lie, who hated the Constitution the more\r\nbecause he had been compelled to feign respect for it, and to whom his\r\nown honour and the love of his people were as nothing, would select\r\nsuch a crisis for some appalling violation of law, for some stroke which\r\nmight remove the chiefs of an Opposition, and intimidate the herd. This\r\nCharles attempted. He missed his blow; but so narrowly, that it would\r\nhave been mere madness in those at whom it was aimed to trust him again.\r\n\r\nIt deserves to be remarked that the King had, a short time before,\r\npromised the most respectable Royalists in the House of Commons,\r\nFalkland, Colepepper, and Hyde, that he would take no measure in which\r\nthat House was concerned, without consulting them. On this occasion he\r\ndid not consult them. His conduct astonished them more than any other\r\nmembers of the assembly. Clarendon says that they were deeply hurt by\r\nthis want of confidence, and the more hurt, because, if they had been\r\nconsulted, they would have {474}done their utmost to dissuade Charles\r\nfrom so improper a proceeding. Did it never occur to Clarendon, will it\r\nnot at least occur to men less partial, that there was good reason for\r\nthis? When the danger to the throne seemed imminent, the King was ready\r\nto put himself for a time into the hands of those who, though they\r\ndisapproved of his past conduct, thought that the remedies had now\r\nbecome worse than the distempers. But we believe that In his heart he\r\nregarded both the parties in the Parliament with feelings of aversion\r\nwhich differed only in the degree of their intensity, and that the\r\nawful warning which he proposed to give, by immolating the principal\r\nsupporters of the Remonstrance, was partly intended for the instruction\r\nof those who had concurred in censuring the ship-money and in abolishing\r\nthe Star-Chamber.\r\n\r\nThe Commons informed the King that their members should be forthcoming\r\nto answer any charge legally brought against them. The Lords refused\r\nto assume the unconstitutional office with which he attempted to invest\r\nthem. And what was then his conduct? He went, attended by hundreds of\r\narmed men, to seize the objects of his hatred in the House itself. The\r\nparty opposed to him more than insinuated that his purpose was of the\r\nmost atrocious kind. We will not condemn him merely on their suspicions.\r\nWe will not hold him answerable for the sanguinary expressions of the\r\nloose brawlers who composed his train. We will judge of his act by\r\nitself alone. And we say, without hesitation, that it is impossible\r\nto acquit him of having meditated violence, and violence which might\r\nprobably end in blood. He knew that the legality of his proceedings was\r\ndenied. He must have known that some of the accused members were men not\r\nlikely to submit {475}peaceably to an illegal arrest. There was every\r\nîeason to expect that he would find them in their places, that they\r\nwould refuse to obey his summons, and that the House would support them\r\nin their refusal. What course would then have been left to him? Unless\r\nwe suppose that he went on this expedition for the sole purpose of\r\nmaking himself ridiculous, we must believe that he would have had\r\nrecourse to force. There would have been a scuffle; and it might not,\r\nunder such circumstances, have been in his power, even if it had been\r\nin his inclination, to prevent a scuffle from ending in a massacre.\r\nFortunately for his fame, unfortunately perhaps for what he prized far\r\nmore, the interests of his hatred and his ambition, the affair ended\r\ndifferently. The birds, as he said, were flown, and his plan was\r\ndisconcerted. Posterity is not extreme to mark abortive crimes; and thus\r\nthe King’s advocates have found it easy to represent a step which, but\r\nfor a trivial accident, might have filled England with mourning and\r\ndismay, as a mere error of judgment, wild and foolish, but perfectly\r\ninnocent. Such was not, however, at the time, the opinion of any party.\r\nThe most zealous Royalists were so much disgusted and ashamed that they\r\nsuspended their opposition to the popular party, and, silently at least,\r\nconcurred in measures of precaution so strong as almost to amount to\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nFrom that day, whatever of confidence and loyal attachment had survived\r\nthe misrule of seventeen years was, in the great body of the people,\r\nextinguished, and extinguished for ever. As soon as the outrage\r\nhad failed, the hypocrisy recommenced. Down to the very eve of this\r\nflagitious attempt, Charles had been talking of his respect for the\r\nprivileges of Parliament {476}and the liberties of his people. He began\r\nagain in the same style on the morrow; but it was too late. To trust him\r\nnow would have been, not moderation, but insanity. What common security\r\nwould suffice against a Prince who was evidently watching his season\r\nwith that cold and patient hatred which, in the long run, tires out\r\nevery other passion?\r\n\r\nIt is certainly from no admiration of Charles that Mr. Hallam\r\ndisapproves of the conduct of the Houses in resorting to arms. But\r\nhe thinks that any attempt on the part of that Prince to establish a\r\ndespotism would have been as strongly opposed by his adherents as by his\r\nenemies, and that therefore the Constitution might be considered as out\r\nof danger, or, at least, that it had more to apprehend from the war than\r\nfrom the King. On this subject Mr. Hallam dilates at length, and with\r\nconspicuous ability. We will offer a few considerations which lead us to\r\nincline to a different opinion.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of England was only one of a large family. In all the\r\nmonarchies of Western Europe, during the middle ages, there existed\r\nrestraints on the royal authority, fundamental laws, and representative\r\nassemblies. In the fifteenth century, the government of Castile seems to\r\nhave been as free as that of our own country. That of Arragon was beyond\r\nall question more so. In France, the sovereign was more absolute. Yet,\r\neven in France, the States-General alone could constitutionally impose\r\ntaxes; and, at the very time when the authority of those assemblies\r\nwas beginning to languish, the Parliament of Paris received such an\r\naccession of strength as enabled it, in some measure, to perform\r\nthe functions of a legislative assembly. Sweden and Denmark had\r\nconstitutions of a similar description. {477}Let us overleap two or\r\nthree hundred years, and contemplate Europe at the commencement of the\r\neighteenth century. Every free constitution, save one, had gone down.\r\nThat of England had weathered the danger, and was riding in full\r\nsecurity. In Denmark and Sweden, the kings had availed themselves of the\r\ndisputes which raged between the nobles and the commons, to unite all\r\nthe powers of government in their own hands. In France the institution\r\nof the States was only mentioned by lawyers as a part of the ancient\r\ntheory of their government. It slept a deep sleep, destined to be broken\r\nby a tremendous waking. No person remembered the sittings of the three\r\norders, or expected ever to see them renewed. Louis the Fourteenth\r\nhad imposed on his parliament a patient silence of sixty years. His\r\ngrandson, after the War of the Spanish Succession, assimilated the\r\nconstitution of Arragon to that of Castile, and extinguished the last\r\nfeeble remains of liberty in the Peninsula. In England, on the other\r\nhand, the Parliament was infinitely more powerful than it had ever been.\r\nNot only was its legislative authority fully established; but its\r\nright to interfere, by advice almost equivalent to command, in every\r\ndepartment of the executive government, was recognised. The appointment\r\nof ministers, the relations with foreign powers, the conduct of a war or\r\na negotiation, depended less on the pleasure of the Prince than on that\r\nof the two Houses.\r\n\r\nWhat then made us to differ? Why was it that, in that epidemic malady of\r\nconstitutions, ours escaped the destroying influence; or rather that, at\r\nthe very crisis of the disease, a favourable turn took place in England,\r\nand in England alone? It was not surely without a cause that so many\r\nkindred systems of government, {478}having flourished together so long,\r\nlanguished and expired at almost the same time.\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion to say, that the progress of civilisation is\r\nfavourable to liberty. The maxim, though in some sense true, must be\r\nlimited by many qualifications and exceptions. Wherever a poor and rude\r\nnation, in which the form of government is a limited monarchy, receives\r\na great accession of wealth and knowledge, it is in imminent danger of\r\nfalling under arbitrary power.\r\n\r\nIn such a state of society as that which existed all over Europe during\r\nthe middle ages, very slight checks sufficed to keep the sovereign in\r\norder. His means of corruption and intimidation were very scanty. He had\r\nlittle money, little patronage, no military establishment. His armies\r\nresembled juries. They were drawn out of the mass of the people:\r\nthey soon returned to it again: and the character which was habitual,\r\nprevailed over that which was occasional. A campaign of forty days was\r\ntoo short, the discipline of a national militia too lax, to efface from\r\ntheir minds the feelings of civil life. As they carried to the camp the\r\nsentiments and interests of the farm and the shop, so they carried back\r\nto the farm and the shop the military accomplishments which they had\r\nacquired in the camp. At home the soldier learned how to value his\r\nrights, abroad how to defend them.\r\n\r\nSuch a military force as this was a far stronger restraint on the regal\r\npower than any legislative assembly. The army, now the most formidable\r\ninstrument of the executive power, was then the most formidable check on\r\nthat power. Resistance to an established government, in modern times\r\nso difficult and perilous an enterprise, was, in the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries, {479}the simplest and easiest matter in the world.\r\nIndeed, it was far too simple and easy. An insurrection was got up then\r\nalmost as easily as a petition is got up now. In a popular cause, or\r\neven in an unpopular cause favoured by a few great nobles, a force of\r\nten thousand armed men was raised in a week. If the King were, like our\r\nEdward the Second and Richard the Second, generally odious, he could not\r\nprocure a bow or halbert. He fell at once and without an effort.\r\nIn such times a sovereign like Louis the Fifteenth or the Emperor Paul,\r\nwould have been pulled down before his misgovernment had lasted for a\r\nmonth. We find that all the fame and influence of our Edward the Third\r\ncould not save his Madame de Pompadour from the effects of the public\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\nHume and many other writers have hastily concluded that, in the\r\nfifteenth century, the English Parliament was altogether servile,\r\nbecause it recognised, without opposition, every successful usurper.\r\nThat it was not servile its conduct on many occasions of inferior\r\nimportance is sufficient to prove. But surely it was not strange that\r\nthe majority of the nobles, and of the deputies chosen by the commons,\r\nshould approve of revolutions which the nobles and commons had effected.\r\nThe Parliament did not blindly follow the event of war, but participated\r\nin those changes of public sentiment on which the event of war depended.\r\nThe legal check was secondary and auxiliary to that which the nation\r\nheld in its own hands. There have always been monarchies in Asia, in\r\nwhich the royal authority has been tempered by fundamental laws, though\r\nno legislative body exists to watch over them. The guarantee is the\r\nopinion of a community of which every individual is a soldier. Thus, the\r\nking of Cabul, {480}as Mr. Elplunstone informs us, cannot augment\r\nthe land revenue, or interfere with the jurisdiction of the ordinary\r\ntribunals.\r\n\r\nIn the European kingdoms of this description there were representative\r\nassemblies. But it was not necessary, that those assemblies should meet\r\nvery frequently, that they should interfere with all the operations\r\nof the executive government, that they should watch with jealousy, and\r\nresent with prompt indignation, every violation of the laws which the\r\nsovereign might commit. They were so strong that they might safely be\r\ncareless. He was so feeble that he might safely be suffered to encroach.\r\nIf he ventured too far, chastisement and ruin were at hand. In fact,\r\nthe people generally suffered more from his weakness than from his\r\nauthority. The tyranny of wealthy and powerful subjects was the\r\ncharacteristic evil of the times. The royal prerogatives were not even\r\nsufficient for the defence of property and the maintenance of police.\r\n\r\nThe progress of civilisation introduced a great change. War became a\r\nscience, and, as a necessary consequence, a trade. The great body of the\r\npeople grew every day more reluctant to undergo the inconveniences of\r\nmilitary service, and better able to pay others for undergoing them.\r\nA new class of men, therefore, dependent on the Crown alone, natural\r\nenemies of those popular rights which are to them as the dew to the\r\nfleece of Gideon, slaves among freemen, freemen among slaves, grew into\r\nimportance. That physical force which, in the dark ages, had belonged\r\nto the nobles and the commons, and had, far more than any charter or any\r\nassembly, been the safeguard of their privileges, was transferred\r\nentire to the King. {481}Monarchy gained in two ways. The sovereign was\r\nstrengthened, the subjects weakened. The great mass of the population,\r\ndestitute of all military discipline and organization, ceased to\r\nexercise any influence by force on political transactions. There have,\r\nindeed, during the last hundred and fifty years, been many popular\r\ninsurrections in Europe: but all have failed, except those in which the\r\nregular army has been induced to join the disaffected.\r\n\r\nThose legal checks which, while the sovereign remained dependent on his\r\nsubjects, had been adequate to the purpose for which they were designed,\r\nwere now found wanting. The dikes which had been sufficient while the\r\nwaters were low were not high enough to keep out the spring-tide. The\r\ndeluge passed over them; and, according to the exquisite illustration of\r\nButler, the formal boundaries which had excluded it, now held it in.\r\nThe old constitutions fared like the old shields and coats of mail. They\r\nwere the defences of a rude age: and they did well enough against the\r\nweapons of a rude age. But new and more formidable means of destruction\r\nwere invented. The ancient panoply became useless; and it was thrown\r\naside to rust in lumber-rooms, or exhibited only as part of an idle\r\npageant.\r\n\r\nThus absolute monarchy was established on the Continent. England\r\nescaped; but she escaped very narrowly. Happily our insular situation,\r\nand the pacific policy of James, rendered standing armies unnecessary\r\nhere, till they had been for some time kept up in the neighbouring\r\nkingdoms. Our public men had therefore an opportunity of watching the\r\neffects produced by this momentous change on governments which bore a\r\nclose analogy to that established in England. Every where {482}they saw\r\nthe power of the monarch increasing, the resistance of assemblies which\r\nwere no longer supported by a national force gradually becoming more\r\nand more feeble, and at length altogether ceasing. The friends and the\r\nenemies of liberty perceived with equal clearness the causes of this\r\ngeneral decay. It is the favourite theme of Strafford. He advises the\r\nKing to procure from the Judges a recognition of his right to raise an\r\narmy at his pleasure. “This place well fortified,” says he, “for ever\r\nvindicates the monarchy at home from under the conditions and restraints\r\nof subjects.” We firmly believe that he was in the right. Nay; we\r\nbelieve that, even if no deliberate scheme of arbitrary government had\r\nbeen formed by the sovereign and his ministers, there was great reason\r\nto apprehend a natural extinction of the Constitution. If, for example,\r\nCharles had played the part of Gustavus Adolphus, if he had carried on\r\na popular war for the defence of the Protestant cause in Germany, if\r\nhe had gratified the national pride by a series of victories, if he had\r\nformed an army of forty or fifty thousand devoted soldiers, we do not\r\nsee what chance the nation would have had of escaping from despotism.\r\nThe Judges would have given as strong a decision in favour of camp-money\r\nas they gave in favour of ship-money. If they had been scrupulous, it\r\nwould have made little difference. An individual who resisted would have\r\nbeen treated as Charles treated Eliot, and as Strafford wished to treat\r\nHampden. The Parliament might have been summoned once in twenty years,\r\nto congratulate a King on his accession, or to give solemnity to some\r\ngreat measure of state. Such had been the fate of legislative assemblies\r\nas powerful, as much respected, as high-spirited, as the English Lords\r\nand Commons. {483}The two Houses, surrounded by the ruins of so many\r\nfree constitutions overthrown or sapped by the new military system, were\r\nrequired to intrust the command of an army and the conduct of the Irish\r\nwar to a King who had proposed to himself the destruction of liberty as\r\nthe great end of his policy. We are decidedly of opinion that it would\r\nhave been fatal to comply. Many of those who took the side of the King\r\non this question would have cursed their own loyalty, if they had seen\r\nhim return from war at the head of twenty thousand troops, accustomed to\r\ncarnage and free quarters in Ireland.\r\n\r\nWe think, with Mr. Hallam, that many of the Royalist nobility and gentry\r\nwere true friends to the Constitution, and that, but for the solemn\r\nprotestations by which the King bound himself to govern according to\r\nthe law for the future, they never would have joined his standard. But\r\nsurely they underrated the public danger. Falkland is commonly selected\r\nas the most respectable specimen of this class. He was indeed a man of\r\ngreat talents and of great virtues, but, we apprehend, infinitely too\r\nfastidious for public life. He did not perceive that, in such times as\r\nthose on which his lot had fallen, the duty of a statesman is to choose\r\nthe better cause and to stand by it, in spite of those excesses by which\r\nevery cause, however good in itself, will be disgraced. The present\r\nevil always seemed to him the worst. He was always going backward and\r\nforward; but it should be remembered to his honour that it was always\r\nfrom the stronger to the weaker side that he deserted. While Charles was\r\noppressing the people, Falkland was a resolute champion of liberty. He\r\nattacked Strafford. He even concurred in strong measures against\r\nEpiscopacy. But the violence of his party {484}annoyed him, and drove\r\nhim to the other party, to be equally annoyed there. Dreading the\r\nsuccess of the cause which he had espoused, disgusted by the courtiers\r\nof Oxford, as he had been disgusted by the patriots of Westminster, yet\r\nbound by honour not to abandon the cause for which he was in arms, he\r\npined away, neglected his person, went about moaning for peace, and at\r\nlast rushed desperately on death, as the best refuge in such miserable\r\ntimes. If he had lived through the scenes that followed, we have little\r\ndoubt that he would have condemned himself to share the exile and\r\nbeggary of the royal family; that he would then have returned to oppose\r\nall their measures; that he would have been sent to the Tower by the\r\nCommons as a stiller of the Popish Plot, and by the King as an\r\naccomplice in the Rye-House Plot; and that, if he had escaped being\r\nhanged, first by Scroggs, and then by Jefferies, he would, after\r\nmanfully opposing James the Second through years of tyranny, have been\r\nseized with a fit of compassion at the very moment of the Revolution,\r\nhave voted for a regency, and died a nonjuror.\r\n\r\nWe do not dispute that the royal party contained many excellent men and\r\nexcellent citizens. But this we say, that they did not discern those\r\ntimes. The peculiar glory of the Houses of Parliament is that, in the\r\ngreat plague and mortality of constitutions, they took their stand\r\nbetween the living and the dead. At the very crisis of our destiny, at\r\nthe very moment when the fate which had passed on every other nation was\r\nabout to pass on England, they arrested the danger.\r\n\r\nThose who conceive that the parliamentary leaders were desirous merely\r\nto maintain the old constitution, and those who represent them\r\nas conspiring to subvert {485}it, are equally in error. The old\r\nconstitution, as we have attempted to show, could not be maintained. The\r\nprogress of time, the increase of wealth, the diffusion of knowledge,\r\nthe great change in the European system of war, rendered it impossible\r\nthat any of the monarchies of the middle ages should continue to\r\nexist on the old footing. The prerogative of the crown was constantly\r\nadvancing. If the privileges of the people were to remain absolutely\r\nstationary, they would relatively retrograde. The monarchical and\r\ndemocratical parts of the government were placed in a situation not\r\nunlike that of the two brothers in the Fairy Queen, one of whom saw the\r\nsoil of his inheritance daily washed away by the tide and joined to\r\nthat of his rival. The portions had at first been fairly meted out. By a\r\nnatural and constant transfer, the one had been extended; the other had\r\ndwindled to nothing. A new partition, or a compensation, was necessary\r\nto restore the original equality.\r\n\r\nIt was now, therefore, absolutely necessary to violate the formal part\r\nof the constitution, in order to preserve its spirit. This might have\r\nbeen done, as it was done at the Revolution, by expelling the reigning\r\nfamily, and calling to the throne princes who, relying solely on an\r\nelective title, would find it necessary to respect the privileges and\r\nfollow the advice of the assemblies to which they owed every thing, to\r\npass every bill which the Legislature strongly pressed upon them, and\r\nto fill the offices of state with men in whom the Legislature confided.\r\nBut, as the two Houses did not choose to change the dynasty, it was\r\nnecessary that they should do directly what at the Revolution was done\r\nindirectly. Nothing is more usual than to hear it said that, if the\r\nHouses had contented themselves {486}with making such a reform in the\r\ngovernment under Charles as was afterwards made under William, they\r\nwould have had the highest claim to national gratitude: and that in\r\ntheir violence they overshot the mark. But how was it possible to make\r\nsuch a settlement under Charles? Charles was not, like William and the\r\nprinces of the Hanoverian line, bound by community of interests and\r\ndangers to the Parliament. It was therefore necessary that he should be\r\nbound by treaty and statute.\r\n\r\nMr. Hallam reprobates, in language which has a little surprised us, the\r\nnineteen propositions into which the Parliament digested its scheme.\r\nIs it possible to doubt that, if James the Second had remained in the\r\nisland, and had been suffered, as he probably would in that case have\r\nbeen suffered, to keep his crown, conditions to the full as hard would\r\nhave been imposed on him? On the other hand, we fully admit that, if the\r\nLong Parliament had pronounced the departure of Charles from London an\r\nabdication, and had called Essex or Northumberland to the throne,\r\nthe new prince might have safely been suffered to reign without such\r\nrestrictions. His situation would have been a sufficient guarantee.\r\n\r\nIn the nineteen propositions we see very little to blame except the\r\narticles against the Catholics. These, however, were in the spirit of\r\nthat age; and to some sturdy churchmen in our own, they may seem\r\nto palliate even the good which the Long Parliament effected. The\r\nregulation with respect to new creations of Peers is the only other\r\narticle about which we entertain any doubt. One of the propositions is\r\nthat the judges shall hold their offices during good behaviour. To\r\nthis surely no exception will be taken. The right of directing the\r\n{487}education and marriage of the princes was most properly claimed by\r\nthe Parliament, on the same ground on which, after the Revolution, it\r\nwas enacted, that no king, on pain of forfeiting his throne, should\r\nespouse a Papist. Unless we condemn the statesmen of the Revolution,\r\nwho conceived that England could not safely be governed by a sovereign\r\nmarried to a Catholic queen, we can scarcely condemn the Long Parliament\r\nbecause, having a sovereign so situated, they thought it necessary to\r\nplace him under strict restraints. The influence of Henrietta Maria had\r\nalready been deeply felt in political affairs. In the regulation of her\r\nfamily, in the education and marriage of her children, it was still more\r\nlikely to be felt. There might be another Catholic queen; possibly, a\r\nCatholic king. Little as we are disposed to join in the vulgar clamour\r\non this subject, we think that such an event ought to be, if possible,\r\naverted; and this could only be done, if Charles was to be left on\r\nthe throne, by placing his domestic arrangements under the control of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nA veto on the appointment of ministers was demanded. But this veto\r\nParliament has virtually possessed ever since the Revolution. It is\r\nno doubt very far better that this power of the Legislature should be\r\nexercised as it is now exercised, when any great occasion calls for\r\ninterference, than that at every change the Commons should have to\r\nsignify their approbation or disapprobation in form. But, unless a new\r\nfamily had been placed on the throne, we do not see how this power could\r\nhave been exercised as it is now exercised. We again repeat, that no\r\nrestraints which could be imposed on the princes who reigned after the\r\nRevolution could have added to the security which their title afforded.\r\nThey were compelled to court their parliaments. But {488}from Charles\r\nnothing was to be expected whicli was not set down in the bond.\r\n\r\nIt was not stipulated that the King should give up his negative on acts\r\nof Parliament. But the Commons had certainly shown a strong disposition\r\nto exact this security also. “Such a doctrine,” says Mr. Hallam, “was\r\nin this country as repugnant to the whole history of our laws, as it was\r\nincompatible with the subsistence of the monarchy in any thing more than\r\na nominal preeminence.” Now this article has been as completely carried\r\ninto effect by the Revolution as if it had been formally inserted in the\r\nBill of Rights and the Act of Settlement. We are surprised, we confess,\r\nthat Mr. Hallam should attach so much importance to a prerogative which\r\nhas not been exercised for a hundred and thirty years, which probably\r\nwill never be exercised again, and which can scarcely, in any\r\nconceivable case, be exercised for a salutary purpose.\r\n\r\nBut the great security, the security without which every other would\r\nhave been insufficient, was the power of the sword. This both parties\r\nthoroughly understood. The Parliament insisted on having the command\r\nof the militia and the direction of the Irish war. “By God, not for an\r\nhour!” exclaimed the King. “Keep the militia,” said the Queen, after the\r\ndefeat of the royal party: “Keep the militia; that will bring back every\r\nthing.” That, by the old constitution, no military authority was lodged\r\nin the Parliament, Mr. Hallam has clearly shown. That it is a species of\r\nauthority which ought not to be permanently lodged in large and divided\r\nassemblies, must, we think, in fairness be conceded. Opposition,\r\npublicity, long discussion, frequent compromise; these are the\r\ncharacteristics of the proceedings of such assemblies. Unity.\r\n{489}secrecy, decision, are the qualities which military arrangements\r\nrequire. There were, therefore, serious objections to the proposition\r\nof the Houses on this subject. But, on the other hand, to trust such\r\na king, at such a crisis, with the very weapon which, in hands less\r\ndangerous, had destroyed so many free constitutions, would have been the\r\nextreme of rashness. The jealousy with which the oligarchy of Venice and\r\nthe States of Holland regarded their generals and armies induced them\r\nperpetually to interfere in matters of which they were incompetent to\r\njudge. This policy secured them against military usurpation, but placed\r\nthem under great disadvantages in war. The uncontrolled power which\r\nthe King of France exercised over his troops enabled him to conquer\r\nhis enemies, but enabled him also to oppress his people. Was there any\r\nintermediate course? None, we confess, altogether free from objection.\r\nBut on the whole, we conceive that the best measure would have been that\r\nwhich the Parliament over and over proposed, namely, that for a limited\r\ntime the power of the sword should be left to the two Houses, and that\r\nit should revert to the Crown when the constitution should be firmly\r\nestablished, and when the new securities of freedom should be so far\r\nstrengthened by prescription that it would be difficult to employ even a\r\nstanding army for the purpose of subverting them.\r\n\r\nMr. Hallam thinks that the dispute might easily have been compromised,\r\nby enacting that the King should have no power to keep a standing army\r\non foot without the consent of Parliament. He reasons as if the question\r\nhad been merely theoretical, and as if at that time no army had been\r\nwanted. “The kingdom,” he says, “might have well dispensed, in that\r\n{490}age, with any military organization.” Now, we think that Mr. Hallam\r\noverlooks the most important circumstance in the whole case. Ireland\r\nwas actually in rebellion; and a great expedition would obviously he\r\nnecessary to reduce that kingdom to obedience. The Houses had therefore\r\nto consider, not an abstract question of law, but an urgent practical\r\nquestion, directly involving the safety of the state. They had to\r\nconsider the expediency of immediately giving a great army to a King\r\nwho was at least as desirous to put down the Parliament of England as to\r\nconquer the insurgents of Ireland.\r\n\r\nOf course we do not mean to defend all the measures of the Houses. Far\r\nfrom it. There never was a perfect man. It would, therefore, be the\r\nheight of absurdity to expect a perfect party or a perfect assembly. For\r\nlarge bodies are far more likely to err than individuals. The passions\r\nare inflamed by sympathy; the fear of punishment and the sense of shame\r\nare diminished by partition. Every day we see men do for their faction\r\nwhat they would die rather than do for themselves.\r\n\r\nScarcely any private quarrel ever happens, in which the right and wrong\r\nare so exquisitely divided that all the right lies on one side, and all\r\nthe wrong on the other. But here was a schism which separated a great\r\nnation into two parties. Of these parties, each was composed of many\r\nsmaller parties. Each contained many members, who differed far less from\r\ntheir moderate opponents than from their violent allies. Each reckoned\r\namong its supporters many who were determined in their choice by some\r\naccident of birth, of connection, or of local situation. Each of them\r\nattracted to itself in multitudes those fierce and turbid {491}spirits,\r\nto whom the clouds and whirlwinds of the political hurricane are\r\nthe atmosphere of life. A party, like a camp, has its sutlers and\r\ncamp-followers, as well as its soldiers. In its progress it collects\r\nround it a vast retinue, composed of people who thrive by its custom\r\nor are amused by its display, who may be sometimes reckoned, in an\r\nostentatious enumeration, as forming a part of it, but who give no aid\r\nto its operations, and take but a languid interest in its success, who\r\nrelax its discipline and dishonour its flag by their irregularities, and\r\nwho, after a disaster, are perfectly ready to cut the throats and rifle\r\nthe baggage of their companions.\r\n\r\nThus it is in every great division; and thus it was in our civil war. On\r\nboth sides there was, undoubtedly, enough of crime and enough of error\r\nto disgust any man who did not reflect that the whole history of the\r\nspecies is made up of little except crimes and errors. Misanthropy is\r\nnot the temper which qualifies a man to act in great affairs, or to\r\njudge of them.\r\n\r\n“Of the Parliament,” says Mr. Hallam, “it may be said, I think, with\r\nnot greater severity than truth, that scarce two or three public acts\r\nof justice, humanity, or generosity, and very few of political wisdom\r\nor courage, are recorded of them, from their quarrel with the King, to\r\ntheir expulsion by Cromwell.” Those who may agree with us in the opinion\r\nwhich we have expressed as to the original demands of the Parliament\r\nwill scarcely concur in this strong censure. The propositions which the\r\nHouses made at Oxford, at Uxbridge, and at Newcastle, were in strict\r\naccordance with these demands. In the darkest period of the war, they\r\nshowed no disposition to concede any vital principle. In the fulness of\r\ntheir success, they showed {492}no disposition to encroach beyond these\r\nlimits. In this respect we cannot but think that they showed justice and\r\ngenerosity, as well as political wisdom and courage.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament was certainly far from faultless. We fully agree with\r\nMr. Hallam in reprobating their treatment of Laud. For the individual,\r\nindeed, we entertain a more unmitigated contempt than for any other\r\ncharacter in our history. The fondness with which a portion of the\r\nchurch regards his memory, can be compared only to that perversity of\r\naffection which sometimes leads a mother to select the monster or the\r\nidiot of the family as the object of her especial favour. Mr. Hallam\r\nhas incidentally observed, that, in the correspondence of Laud with\r\nStrafford, there are no indications of a sense of duty towards God or\r\nman. The admirers of the Archbishop have, in consequence, inflicted upon\r\nthe public a crowd of extracts designed to prove the contrary. Now, in\r\nall those passages, we see nothing which a prelate as wicked as Pope\r\nAlexander or Cardinal Dubois might not have written. Those passages\r\nindicate no sense of duty to God or man, but simply a strong interest in\r\nthe prosperity and dignity of the order to which the writer belonged;\r\nan interest which, when kept within certain limits, does not deserve\r\ncensure, but which can never be considered as a virtue. Laud is anxious\r\nto accommodate satisfactorily the disputes in the University of Dublin.\r\nHe regrets to hear that a church is used as a stable, and that the\r\nbenefices of Ireland are very poor. He is desirous that, however small a\r\ncongregation may be, service should be regularly performed. He expresses\r\na wish that the judges of the court before which questions of tithe are\r\ngenerally brought should be selected {493}with a view to the interest of\r\nthe clergy. All this may be very proper; and it may be very proper that\r\nan alderman should stand up for the tolls of his borough; and an East\r\nIndia director for the charter of his Company. But it is ridiculous to\r\nsay that these things indicate piety and benevolence. No primate, though\r\nhe were the most abandoned of mankind, could wish to see the body, with\r\nthe influence of which his own influence was identical, degraded in the\r\npublic estimation by internal dissensions, by the ruinous state of its\r\nedifices, and by the slovenly performance of its rites. We willingly\r\nacknowledge that the particular letters in question have very little\r\nharm in them; a compliment which cannot often be paid either to the\r\nwritings or to the actions of Laud.\r\n\r\nBad as the Archbishop was, however, he was not a traitor within the\r\nstatute. Nor was he by any means so formidable as to be a proper subject\r\nfor a retrospective ordinance of the legislature. His mind had not\r\nexpansion enough to comprehend a great scheme, good or bad. His\r\noppressive acts were not, like those of the Earl of Strafford, parts\r\nof an extensive system. They were the luxuries in which a mean and\r\nirritable disposition indulges itself from day to day, the excesses\r\nnatural to a little mind in a great place. The severest punishment which\r\nthe two Houses could have inflicted on him would have been to set him at\r\nliberty and send him to Oxford. There he might have staid, tortured by\r\nhis own diabolical temper, hungering for Puritans to pillory and mangle,\r\nplaguing the Cavaliers, for want of somebody else to plague, with\r\nhis peevishness and absurdity, performing grimaces and antics in the\r\ncathedral, continuing that incomparable diary, which we never sec\r\nwithout forgetting the vices of his heart {494}in the imbecility of his\r\nintellect, minuting down his dreams, counting the drops of blood which\r\nfell from his nose, watching the direction of the salt, and listening\r\nfor the note of the screech-owls. Contemptuous mercy was the only\r\nvengeance which it became the Parliament to take on such a ridiculous\r\nold bigot.\r\n\r\nThe Houses, it must be acknowledged, committed great errors In the\r\nconduct of the war, or rather one great error, which brought their\r\naffairs into a condition requiring the most perilous expedients. The\r\nparliamentary leaders of what may be called the first generation, Essex,\r\nManchester, Northumberland, Hollis, even Pym, all the most eminent men,\r\nin short, Hampden excepted, were inclined to half measures. They dreaded\r\na decisive victory almost as much as a decisive overthrow. They wished\r\nto bring the King into a situation which might render it necessary\r\nfor him to grant their just and wise demands, but not to subvert the\r\nconstitution or to change the dynasty. They were afraid of serving the\r\npurposes of those fierce and determined enemies of monarchy, who now\r\nbegan to show themselves in the lower ranks of the party. The war was,\r\ntherefore, conducted in a languid and inefficient manner. A resolute\r\nleader might have brought it to a close in a month. At the end of three\r\ncampaigns, however, the event was still dubious; and that it had not\r\nbeen decidedly unfavourable to the cause of liberty was principally\r\nOwing to the skill and energy which the more violent Roundheads had\r\ndisplayed in subordinate situations. The conduct of Fairfax and Cromwell\r\nat Mars-ton had exhibited a remarkable contrast to that of Essex at\r\nEdgehill, and to that of Waller at Lansdowne.\r\n\r\nIf there be any truth established by the universal experience of\r\nnations, it is this, that to carry the spirit of {495}peace into war\r\nis a weak and cruel policy. The time of negotiation is the time for\r\ndeliberation and delay. But when an extreme case calls for that remedy\r\nwhich is in its own nature most violent, and which, in such cases, is a\r\nremedy only because it is violent, it is idle to think of mitigating\r\nand diluting. Languid war can do nothing which negotiation or submission\r\nwill not do better: and to act on any other principle is, not to save\r\nblood and money, but to squander them.\r\n\r\nThis the parliamentary leaders found. The third year of hostilities was\r\ndrawing to a close; and they had not conquered the King. They had not\r\nobtained even those advantages which they had expected from a policy\r\nobviously erroneous in a military point of view. They had wished to\r\nhusband their resources. They now found that in enterprises like\r\ntheirs, parsimony is the worst profusion. They had hoped to effect a\r\nreconciliation. The event taught them that the best way to conciliate\r\nis to bring the work of destruction to a speedy termination. By their\r\nmoderation many lives and much property had been wasted. The angry\r\npassions which, if the contest had been short, would have died away\r\nalmost as soon as they appeared, had fixed themselves in the form of\r\ndeep and lasting hatred. A military caste had grown up. Those who had\r\nbeen induced to take up arms by the patriotic feelings of citizens had\r\nbegun to entertain the professional feelings of soldiers. Above all, the\r\nleaders of the party had forfeited its confidence. If they had, by their\r\nvalour and abilities, gained a complete victory, their influence might\r\nhave been sufficient to prevent their associates from abusing it. It\r\nwas now necessary to choose more resolute and uncompromising commanders.\r\nUnhappily the illustrious man who alone united in himself all the\r\n{496}talents and virtues which the crisis required, who alone could have\r\nsaved his country from the present dangers without plunging her into\r\nothers, who alone could have united all the friends of liberty in\r\nobedience to his commanding genius and his venerable name, was no more.\r\nSomething might still be done. The Houses might still avert that worst\r\nof all evils, the triumphant return of an imperious and unprincipled\r\nmaster. They might still preserve London from all the horrors of rapine,\r\nmassacre, and lust. But their hopes of a victory as spotless as their\r\ncause, of a reconciliation which might knit together the hearts of\r\nall honest Englishmen for the defence of the public good, of durable\r\ntranquillity, of temperate freedom, were buried in the grave of Hampden.\r\n\r\nThe self-denying ordinance was passed, and the army was remodelled.\r\nThese measures were undoubtedly full of danger. But all that was left to\r\nthe Parliament was to take the less of two dangers. And we think that,\r\neven if they could have accurately foreseen all that followed, their\r\ndecision ought to have been the same. Under any circumstances, we should\r\nhave preferred Cromwell to Charles. But there could be no comparison\r\nbetween Cromwell and Charles victorious, Charles restored, Charles\r\nenabled to feed fat all the hungry grudges of his smiling rancour\r\nand his cringing pride. The next visit of his Majesty to his faithful\r\nCommons would have been more serious than that with which he last\r\nhonoured them; more serious than that which their own General paid them\r\nsome years after. The King would scarce have been content with praying\r\nthat the Lord would deliver him from Vane, or with pulling Marten by\r\nthe cloak. If, by fatal mismanagement, nothing was left to England but a\r\nchoice of {497}tyrants, the last tyrant whom she should have chosen was\r\nCharles.\r\n\r\nFrom the apprehension of this worst evil the Houses were soon delivered\r\nby their new leaders. The armies of Charles were every where routed, his\r\nfastnesses stormed, his party humbled and subjugated. The King himself\r\nfell into the hands of the Parliament; and both the King and the\r\nParliament soon fell into the hands of the army. The fate of both the\r\ncaptives was the same. Both were treated alternately with respect and\r\nwith insult. At length the natural life of one, and the political life\r\nof the other, were terminated by violence; and the power for which both\r\nhad struggled was united in a single hand. Men naturally sympathize with\r\nthe calamities of individuals; but they are inclined to look on a fallen\r\nparty with contempt rather than with pity. Thus misfortune turned the\r\ngreatest of Parliaments into the despised Rump, and the worst of Kings\r\ninto the Blessed Martyr.\r\n\r\nMr. Hallam decidedly condemns the execution of Charles; and in all that\r\nhe says on that subject we heartily agree. We fully concur with him in\r\nthinking that a great social schism, such as the civil war, is not to be\r\nconfounded with an ordinary treason, and that the vanquished ought to be\r\ntreated according to the rules, not of municipal, but of international\r\nlaw. In this case the distinction is of the less importance, because\r\nboth international and municipal law were in favour of Charles. He was a\r\nprisoner of war by the former, a King by the latter. By neither was he a\r\ntraitor. If he had been successful, and had put his leading opponents to\r\ndeath, he would have deserved severe censure; and this without reference\r\nto the justice or injustice of his cause. Yet the opponents of\r\n{498}Charles, it must be admitted, were technically guilty of\r\ntreason. He might have sent them to the scaffold without violating any\r\nestablished principle of jurisprudence. He would not have been compelled\r\nto overturn the whole constitution in order to reach them. Here his\r\nown case differed widely from theirs. Not only was his condemnation in\r\nitself a measure which only the strongest necessity could vindicate; but\r\nit could not be procured without taking several previous steps, every\r\none of which would have required the strongest necessity to vindicate\r\nit. It could not be procured without dissolving the government by\r\nmilitary force, without establishing precedents of the most dangerous\r\ndescription, without creating difficulties which the next ten years\r\nwere spent in removing, without pulling down institutions which it soon\r\nbecame necessary to reconstruct, and setting up others which almost\r\nevery man was soon impatient to destroy. It was necessary to strike the\r\nHouse of Lords out of the constitution, to exclude members of the House\r\nof Commons by force, to make a new crime, a new tribunal, a new mode of\r\nprocedure: The whole legislative and judicial systems were trampled down\r\nfor the purpose of taking a single head. Not only those parts of the\r\nconstitution which the republicans were desirous to destroy, but those\r\nwhich they wished to retain and exalt, were deeply injured by these\r\ntransactions. High Courts of Justice began to usurp the functions of\r\njuries. The remaining delegates of the people were soon driven from\r\ntheir seats by the same military violence which had enabled them to\r\nexclude their colleagues.\r\n\r\nIf Charles had been the last of his line, there would have been an\r\nintelligible reason for putting him to death. But the blow which\r\nterminated his life at once {499}transferred the allegiance of every\r\nRoyalist to an heir, and an heir who was at liberty. To kill the\r\nindividual was, under such circumstances, not to destroy, but to release\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\nWe detest the character of Charles; but a man ought not to be removed by\r\na law _ex post facto_, even constitutionally procured, merely because he\r\nis detestable. He must also be very dangerous. We can scarcely conceive\r\nthat any danger which a state can apprehend from any individual could\r\njustify the violent measures which were necessary to procure a sentence\r\nagainst Charles. But in fact the danger amounted to nothing. There was\r\nindeed danger from the attachment of a large party to his office. But\r\nthis danger his execution only increased. His personal influence was\r\nlittle indeed. He had lost the confidence of every party. Churchmen,\r\nCatholics, Presbyterians, Independents, his enemies, his friends, his\r\ntools, English, Scotch, Irish, all divisions and subdivisions of his\r\npeople had been deceived by him. His most attached councillors turned\r\naway with shame and anguish from his false and hollow policy, plot\r\nintertwined with plot, mine sprung beneath mine, agents disowned,\r\npromises evaded, one pledge given in private, another in public.\r\n“Oh, Mr. Secretary,” says Clarendon, in a letter to Nicholas, “those\r\nstratagems have given me more sad hours than all the misfortunes in war\r\nwhich have befallen the King, and look like the effects of God’s anger\r\ntowards us.”\r\n\r\nThe abilities of Charles were not formidable. His taste in the fine arts\r\nwas indeed exquisite; and few modern sovereigns have written or spoken\r\nbetter. But he was not fit for active life. In negotiation he was always\r\ntrying to dupe others, and duping only himself. {500}As a soldier, he\r\nwas feeble, dilatory, and miserably wanting, not in personal courage,\r\nbut in the presence of mind which his station required. His delay at\r\nGloucester saved the parliamentary party from destruction. At Naseby,\r\nin the very crisis of his fortune, his want of self-possession spread\r\na fatal panic through his army. The story which Clarendon tells of that\r\naffair reminds us of the excuses by which Bessus and Bobadil explain\r\ntheir cudgellings. A Scotch nobleman, it seems, begged the King not to\r\nrun upon his death, took hold of his bridle, and turned his horse round.\r\nNo man who had much value for his life would have tried to perform the\r\nsame friendly office on that day for Oliver Cromwell.\r\n\r\nOne thing, and one alone, could make Charles dangerous, a violent death.\r\nHis tyranny could not break the high spirit of the English people.\r\nHis arms could not conquer, his arts could not deceive them; but his\r\nhumiliation and his execution melted them into a generous compassion.\r\nMen who die on a scaffold for political offences almost always die well.\r\nThe eyes of thousands are fixed upon them. Enemies and admirers are\r\nwatching their demeanour. Every tone of voice, every change of colour,\r\nis to go down to posterity. Escape is impossible. Supplication is vain.\r\nIn such a situation, pride and despair have often been known to nerve\r\nthe weakest minds with fortitude adequate to the occasion. Charles died\r\npatiently and bravely; not more patiently or bravely, indeed, than many\r\nother victims of political rage; not more patiently or bravely than his\r\nown Judges, who were not only killed, but tortured; or than Vane, who\r\nhad always been considered as a timid man. However, the King’s conduct\r\nduring his trial and at his execution made a prodigious {501}impression.\r\nHis subjects began to love his memory as heartily as they had hated his\r\nperson; and posterity has estimated his character from his death rather\r\nthan from his life.\r\n\r\nTo represent Charles as a martyr in the cause of Episcopacy is absurd.\r\nThose who put him to death cared as little for the Assembly of Divines\r\nas for the Convocation, and would, in all probability, only have hated\r\nhim the more if he had agreed to set up the Presbyterian discipline.\r\nIndeed, in spite of the opinion of Mr. Hallam, we are inclined to think\r\nthat the attachment of Charles to the Church of England was altogether\r\npolitical. Human nature is, we admit, so capricious that there may be\r\na single sensitive point in a conscience which every where else is\r\ncallous. A man without truth or humanity may have some strange scruples\r\nabout a trifle. There was one devout warrior in the royal camp whose\r\npiety bore a great resemblance to that which is ascribed to the King.\r\nWe mean Colonel Turner. That gallant Cavalier was hanged, after the\r\nRestoration, for a flagitious burglary. At the gallows he told the crowd\r\nthat his mind received great consolation from one reflection: he had\r\nalways taken off his hat when he went into a church. The character of\r\nCharles would scarcely rise in our estimation, if we believed that he\r\nwas pricked in conscience after the manner of this worthy loyalist, and\r\nthat while violating all the first rules of Christian morality, he was\r\nsincerely scrupulous about church-government. But we acquit him of such\r\nweakness. In 1641, he deliberately confirmed the Scotch Declaration\r\nwhich stated that the government of the church by archbishops and\r\nbishops was contrary to the word of God. In 1645, he appears to\r\nhave offered to set up Popery in Ireland. That a {502}King who had\r\nestablished the Presbyterian religion in one kingdom, and who was\r\nwilling to establish the Catholic religion in another, should have\r\ninsurmountable scruples about the ecclesiastical constitution of the\r\nthird, is altogether incredible. He himself says in his letters that he\r\nlooks on Episcopacy as a stronger support of monarchical power than even\r\nthe army. From causes which we have already considered, the Established\r\nChurch had been, since the Reformation, the great bulwark of the\r\nprerogative. Charles wished, therefore, to preserve it. He thought\r\nhimself necessary both to the Parliament and to the army. He did not\r\nforesee, till too late, that, by paltering with the Presbyterians, he\r\nshould put both them and himself into the power of a fiercer and more\r\ndaring party. If he had foreseen it, we suspect that the royal blood\r\nwhich still cries to Heaven, every thirtieth of January, for judgments\r\nonly to be averted by salt-fish and egg-sauce, would never have been\r\nshed. One who had swallowed the Scotch Declaration would scarcely strain\r\nat the Covenant.\r\n\r\nThe death of Charles and the strong measures which led to it raised\r\nCromwell to a height of power fatal to the infant Commonwealth. No\r\nmen occupy so splendid a place in history as those who have founded\r\nmonarchies on the ruins of republican institutions. Their glory, if not\r\nof the purest, is assuredly of the most seductive and dazzling kind. In\r\nnations broken to the curb, in nations long accustomed to be transferred\r\nfrom one tyrant to another, a man without eminent qualities may easily\r\ngain supreme power. The defection of a troop of guards, a conspiracy of\r\neunuchs, a popular tumult, might place an indolent senator or a brutal\r\nsoldier on the throne of the Roman world. Similar {503}revolutions have\r\noften occurred in the despotic states of Asia. But a community which\r\nhas heard the voice of truth and experienced the pleasures of liberty,\r\nin which the merits of statesmen and of systems are freely canvassed,\r\nin which obedience is paid, not to persons but to laws, in which\r\nmagistrates are regarded, not as the lords, but as the servants of the\r\npublic, in which the excitement of party is a necessary of life, in\r\nwhich political warfare is reduced to a system of tactics; such a\r\ncommunity is not easily reduced to servitude. Beasts of burden may\r\neasily be managed by a new master. But will the wild ass submit to the\r\nbonds? Will the unicorn serve and abide by the crib? Will leviathan hold\r\nout his nostrils to the hook? The mythological conqueror of the East,\r\nwhose enchantments reduced wild beasts to the tameness of domestic\r\ncattle, and who harnessed lions and tigers to his chariot, is but an\r\nimperfect type of those extraordinary minds which have thrown a spell\r\non the fierce spirits of nations unaccustomed to control, and have\r\ncompelled raging factions to obey their reins and swell their triumph.\r\nThe enterprise, be it good or bad, is one which requires a truly great\r\nman. It demands courage, activity, energy, wisdom, firmness, conspicuous\r\nvirtues, or vices so splendid and alluring as to resemble virtues.\r\n\r\nThose who have succeeded in this arduous undertaking form a very small\r\nand a very remarkable class. Parents of tyranny, heirs of freedom,\r\nkings among citizens, citizens among kings, they unite in themselves the\r\ncharacteristics of the system which springs from them, and those of the\r\nsystem from which they have sprung. Their reigns shine with a double\r\nlight, the last and dearest rays of departing freedom mingled with\r\nthe first and brightest glories of empire in its {504}dawn. The high\r\nqualities of such a prince lend to despotism itself a charm drawn from\r\nthe liberty under which they were formed, and which they have destroyed.\r\nHe resembles an European who settles within the Tropics, and carries\r\nthither the strength and the energetic habits acquired in regions more\r\npropitious to the constitution. He differs as widely from princes nursed\r\nin the purple of imperial cradles, as the companions of Gama from their\r\ndwarfish and imbecile progeny which, born in a climate unfavourable to\r\nits growth and beauty, degenerates more and more, at every descent, from\r\nthe qualities of the original conquerors.\r\n\r\nIn this class three men stand preeminent, Cæsar, Cromwell, and\r\nBonaparte. The highest place in this remarkable triumvirate belongs\r\nundoubtedly to Cæsar. He united the talents of Bonaparte to those of\r\nCromwell; and he possessed also, what neither Cromwell nor Bonaparte\r\npossessed, learning, taste, wit, eloquence, the sentiments and the\r\nmanners of an accomplished gentleman.\r\n\r\nBetween Cromwell and Napoleon Mr. Hallam has instituted a parallel,\r\nscarcely less ingenious than that which Burke has drawn between Richard\r\nCour de Lion and Charles the Twelfth of Sweden. In this parallel,\r\nhowever, and indeed throughout his work, we think that he hardly gives\r\nCromwell fair measure.\r\n\r\n“Cromwell,” says he, “far unlike his antitype, never showed any signs of\r\na legislative mind, or any desire to place his renown on that noblest\r\nbasis, the amelioration of social institutions.” The difference in this\r\nrespect, we conceive, was not in the character of the men, but in the\r\ncharacters of the revolutions by means of which they rose to power. The\r\ncivil war in England {505}had been undertaken to defend and restore;\r\nthe republicans of France set themselves to destroy. In England, the\r\nprinciples of the common law had never been disturbed, and most even of\r\nits forms had been held sacred. In France, the law and its ministers had\r\nbeen swept away together. In France, therefore, legislation necessarily\r\nbecame the first business of the first settled government which rose\r\non the ruins of the old system. The admirers of Inigo Jones have always\r\nmaintained that his works are inferior to those of Sir Christopher Wren,\r\nonly because the great fire of London gave Wren such a field for the\r\ndisplay of his powers as no architect in the history of the world ever\r\npossessed. Similar allowance must be made for Cromwell. If he\r\nerected little that was new, it was because there had been no general\r\ndevastation to clear a space for him. As it was, he reformed the\r\nrepresentative system in a most judicious manner. He rendered the\r\nadministration of justice uniform throughout the island. We will quote\r\na passage from his speech to the Parliament in September, 1656,\r\nwhich contains, we think, simple and rude as the diction is, stronger\r\nindications of a legislative mind, than are to be found in the whole\r\nrange of orations delivered on such occasions before or since.\r\n\r\n“There is one general grievance in the nation. It is the law. I think,\r\nI may say it, I have as eminent judges in this land as have been had,\r\nor that the nation has had for these many years. Truly, I could be\r\nparticular as to the executive part, to the administration; but\r\nthat would trouble you. But the truth of it is, there are wicked and\r\nabominable laws that will be in your power to alter. To hang a man for\r\nsixpence, threepence, I know not what,--to hang for a {506}trifle, and\r\npardon murder, is in the ministration of the law through the ill framing\r\nof it. I have known in my experience abominable murders quitted; and\r\nto see men lose their lives for petty matters! This is a thing that God\r\nwill reckon for; and I wish it may not lie upon this nation a day\r\nlonger than you have an opportunity to give a remedy; and I hope I shall\r\ncheerfully join with you in it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hallam truly says that, though it is impossible to rank Cromwell\r\nwith Napoleon as a general, yet “his exploits were as much above\r\nthe level of his contemporaries, and more the effects of an original\r\nuneducated capacity.” Bonaparte was trained in the best military\r\nschools; the army which he led to Italy was one of the finest that ever\r\nexisted. Cromwell passed his youth and the prime of his manhood in a\r\ncivil situation. He never looked on war till he was more than forty\r\nyears old. He had first to form himself, and then to form his troops.\r\nOut of raw levies he created an army, the bravest and the best\r\ndisciplined, the most orderly in peace, and the most terrible in war,\r\nthat Europe had seen. He called this body into existence. He led it to\r\nconquest. He never fought a battle without gaining it. He never\r\ngained a battle without annihilating the force opposed to him. Yet his\r\nvictories were not the highest glory of his military system. The respect\r\nwhich his troops paid to property, their attachment to the laws and\r\nreligion of their country, their submission to the civil power, their\r\ntemperance, their intelligence, their industry, are without parallel. It\r\nwas after the Restoration that the spirit which their great leader had\r\ninfused into them was most signally displayed. At the command of the\r\nestablished government, an established government which {507}had no\r\nmeans of enforcing obedience, fifty thousand soldiers, whose backs no\r\nenemy had ever seen, either in domestic or in continental war, laid down\r\ntheir arms, and retired into the mass of the people, thenceforward to\r\nbe distinguished only by superior diligence, sobriety, and regularity\r\nin the pursuits of peace, from the other members of the community which\r\nthey had saved.\r\n\r\nIn the general spirit and character of his administration, we think\r\nCromwell far superior to Napoleon. “In civil government,” says Mr.\r\nHallam, “there can be no adequate parallel between one who had sucked\r\nonly the dregs of a besotted fanaticism, and one to whom the stores of\r\nreason and philosophy were open.” These expressions, it seems to\r\nus, convey the highest eulogium on our great countryman. Reason\r\nand philosophy did not teach the conqueror of Europe to command his\r\npassions, or to pursue, as a first object, the happiness of his people.\r\nThey did not prevent him from risking his fame and his power in a\r\nfrantic contest against the principles of human nature and the laws of\r\nthe physical world, against the rage of the winter and the liberty\r\nof the sea. They did not exempt him from the influence of that most\r\npernicious of superstitions, a presumptuous fatalism. They did not\r\npreserve him from the inebriation of prosperity, or restrain him from\r\nindecent querulousness in adversity. On the other hand, the fanaticism\r\nof Cromwell never urged him on impracticable undertakings, or confused\r\nhis perception of the public good. Our countryman, inferior to Bonaparte\r\nin invention, was far superior to him in wisdom. The French Emperor is\r\namong conquerors what Voltaire is among writers, a miraculous child.\r\nHis splendid genius was frequently clouded by fits of humour as absurdly\r\nperverse as those of the pet {508}of the nursery, who quarrels with his\r\nfood, and dashes his playthings to pieces. Cromwell was emphatically a\r\nman. He possessed, in an eminent degree, that masculine and full-grown\r\nrobustness of mind, that equally diffused intellectual health, which,\r\nif our national partiality does not mislead us, has peculiarly\r\ncharacterised the great men of England. Never was any ruler so\r\nconspicuously born for sovereignty. The cup which has intoxicated almost\r\nall others sobered him. His spirit, restless from its own buoyancy in\r\na lower sphere, reposed in majestic placidity as soon as it had reached\r\nthe level congenial to it. He had nothing in common with that large\r\nclass of men who distinguish themselves in subordinate posts, and whose\r\nincapacity becomes obvious as soon as the public voice summons them\r\nto take the lead. Rapidly as his fortunes grew, his mind expanded\r\nmore rapidly still. Insignificant as a private citizen, he was a great\r\ngeneral; he was a still greater prince. Napoleon had a theatrical\r\nmanner, in which the coarseness of a revolutionary guard-room was\r\nblended with the ceremony of the old Court of Versailles. Cromwell,\r\nby the confession even of his enemies, exhibited in his demeanour the\r\nsimple and natural nobleness of a man neither ashamed of his origin\r\nnor vain of his elevation, of a man who had found his proper place in\r\nsociety, and who felt secure that he was competent to fill it. Easy,\r\neven to familiarity, where his own dignity was concerned, he was\r\npunctilious only for his country. His own character he left to take care\r\nof itself; he left it to be defended by his victories in war, and his\r\nreforms in peace. But he was a jealous and implacable guardian of the\r\npublic honour. He suffered a crazy Quaker to insult him in the gallery\r\nof Whitehall, and {509}revenged himself only by liberating him and\r\ngiving him a dinner. But he was prepared to risk the chancel of war to\r\navenge the blood of a private Englishman.\r\n\r\nNo sovereign ever carried to the throne so large a portion of the best\r\nqualities of the middling orders, so strong a sympathy with the feelings\r\nand interests of his people. He was sometimes driven to arbitrary\r\nmeasures; but he had a high, stout, honest, English heart. Hence it was\r\nthat he loved to surround his throne with such men as Hale and Blake.\r\nHence it was that he allowed so large a share of political liberty to\r\nhis subjects, and that, even when an opposition dangerous to his power\r\nand to his person almost compelled him to govern by the sword, he was\r\nstill anxious to leave a germ from which, at a more favourable season,\r\nfree institutions might spring. We firmly believe that, if his first\r\nParliament had not commenced its debates by disputing his title, his\r\ngovernment would have been as mild at home as it was energetic and able\r\nabroad. He was a soldier; he had risen by war. Had his ambition been of\r\nan impure or selfish kind, it would have been easy for him to plunge his\r\ncountry into continental hostilities on a large scale, and to dazzle\r\nthe restless factions which he ruled, by the splendour of his victories.\r\nSome of his enemies have sneeringly remarked, that in the successes\r\nobtained under his administration he had no personal share; as if a man\r\nwho had raised himself from obscurity to empire solely by his military\r\ntalents could have any unworthy reason for shrinking from military\r\nenterprise. This reproach is his highest glory. In the success of the\r\nEnglish navy he could have no selfish interest. Its triumphs added\r\nnothing to his fame; its increase added nothing to his means of\r\noverawing his enemies; its {510}great leader was not his friend. Yet he\r\ntook a peculiar pleasure in encouraging that noble service which, of all\r\nthe instruments employed by an English government, is the most impotent\r\nfor mischief, and the most powerful for good. His administration was\r\nglorious, but with no vulgar glory. It was not one of those periods of\r\noverstrained and convulsive exertion which necessarily produce debility\r\nand langour. Its energy was natural, healthful, temperate. He placed\r\nEngland at the head of the Protestant interest, and in the first rank of\r\nChristian powers. He taught every nation to value her friendship and\r\nto dread her enmity. But he did not squander her resources in a vain\r\nattempt to invest her with that supremacy which no power, in the modern\r\nsystem of Europe, can safely affect, or can long retain.\r\n\r\nThis noble and sober wisdom had its reward. If he did not carry the\r\nbanners of the Commonwealth in triumph to distant capitals, if he did\r\nnot adorn Whitehall with the spoils of the Stadthouse and the Louvre, if\r\nhe did not portion out Flanders and Germany into principalities for his\r\nkinsmen and his generals, he did not, on the other hand, see his country\r\noverrun by the armies of nations which his ambition had provoked. He did\r\nnot drag out the last years of his life an exile and a prisoner, in\r\nan unhealthy climate and under an ungenerous gaoler, raging with the\r\nimpotent desire of vengeance, and brooding over visions of departed\r\nglory. He went down to his grave in the fulness of power and fame; and\r\nhe left to his son an authority which any man of ordinary firmness and\r\nprudence would have retained.\r\n\r\nBut for the weakness of that foolish Ishbosheth, the opinions which\r\nwe have been expressing would, we {511}believe, now have formed the\r\northodox creed of good Englishmen. We might now be writing under the\r\ngovernment of his Highness Oliver the Fifth or Richard the Fourth,\r\nProtector, by the grace of God, of the Commonwealth of England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland, and the dominions thereto belonging. The form\r\nof the great founder of the dynasty, on horseback, as when he led the\r\ncharge at Naseby, or on foot, as when he took the mace from the table\r\nof the Commons, would adorn our squares and overlook our public offices\r\nfrom Charing-Cross; and sermons in his praise would be duly preached on\r\nhis lucky day, the third of September, by court-chaplains, guiltless of\r\nthe abomination of the surplice.\r\n\r\nBut, though his memory has not been taken under the patronage of any\r\nparty, though every device has been used to blacken it, though to praise\r\nhim would long have been a punishable crime, truth and merit at last\r\nprevail. Cowards who had trembled at the very sound of his name, tools\r\nof office who, like Downing, had been proud of the honour of lacqueying\r\nhis coach, might insult him in loyal speeches and addresses. Venal poets\r\nmight transfer to the King the same eulogies, little the worse for wear,\r\nwhich they had bestowed on the Protector. A fickle multitude might crowd\r\nto shout and scoff round the gibbeted remains of the greatest Prince\r\nand Soldier of the age. But when the Dutch cannon startled an effeminate\r\ntyrant in his own palace, when the conquests which had been won by the\r\narmies of Cromwell were sold to pamper the harlots of Charles, when\r\nEnglishmen were sent to fight under foreign banners, against the\r\nindependence of Europe and the Protestant religion, many honest hearts\r\nswelled in secret at the thought of one who had never {512}suffered\r\nhis country to be ill used by any but himself. It must indeed have been\r\ndifficult for any Englishman to see the salaried Viceroy of France, at\r\nthe most important crisis of his fate, sauntering through his harem,\r\nyawning and talking nonsense over a dispatch, or beslobbering his\r\nbrother and his courtiers in a fit of maudlin affection, without\r\na respectful and tender remembrance of him before whose genius the\r\nyoung-pride of Lewis and the veteran craft of Mazarin had stood rebuked,\r\nwho had humbled Spain on the land and Holland on the sea, and whose\r\nimperial voice had arrested the sails of the Lybian pirates and the\r\npersecuting fires of Rome. Even to the present day his character, though\r\nconstantly attacked, and scarcely ever defended, is popular with the\r\ngreat body of our countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe most blameable act of his life was the execution of Charles. We have\r\nalready strongly condemned that proceeding; but we by no means consider\r\nit as one which attaches any peculiar stigma of infamy to the names of\r\nthose who participated in it. It was an unjust and injudicious display\r\nof violent party spirit; but it was not a cruel or perfidious measure.\r\nIt had all those features which distinguish the errors of magnanimous\r\nand intrepid spirits from base and malignant crimes.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that Cromwell is dead and buried, we go on in almost\r\nperfect harmony with Mr. Hallam to the end of his book. The times which\r\nfollowed the Restoration peculiarly require that unsparing impartiality\r\nwhich is his most distinguishing virtue. No part of our history,\r\nduring the last three centuries, presents a spectacle of such general\r\ndreariness. The whole breed of our statesmen seems to have degenerated;\r\n{513}and their moral and intellectual littleness strikes us with the\r\nmore disgust, because we sec it placed in immediate contrast with the\r\nhigh and majestic qualities of the race which they succeeded. In the\r\ngreat civil war, even the bad cause had been rendered respectable and\r\namiable by the purity and elevation of mind which many of its friends\r\ndisplayed. Under Charles the Second, the best and noblest of ends\r\nwas disgraced by means the most cruel and sordid. The rage of faction\r\nsucceeded to the love of liberty. Loyalty died away into servility. We\r\nlook in vain among the leading politicians of either side for steadiness\r\nof principle, or even for that vulgar fidelity to party which, in our\r\ntime, it is esteemed infamous to violate. The inconsistency, perfidy,\r\nand baseness, which the leaders constantly practised, which their\r\nfollowers defended, and which the great body of the people regarded, as\r\nit seems, with little disapprobation, appear in the present age almost\r\nincredible. In the age of Charles the First, they would, we believe,\r\nhave excited as much astonishment.\r\n\r\nMan, however, is always the same. And when so marked a difference\r\nappears between two generations, it is certain that the solution may be\r\nfound in their respective circumstances. The principal statesmen of the\r\nreign of Charles the Second were trained during the civil war and the\r\nrevolutions which followed it. Such a period is eminently favourable to\r\nthe growth of quick and active talents. It forms a class of men, shrewd,\r\nvigilant, inventive; of men whose dexterity triumphs over the most\r\nperplexing combinations of circumstances, whose presaging instinct no\r\nsign of the times can elude. But it is an unpropitious season for the\r\nfirm and masculine virtues. The statesman who enters on his career\r\nat such a time, can form no permanent {514}connections, can make no\r\naccurate observations on the higher parts of political science. Before\r\nhe can attach himself to a party, it is scattered. Before he can study\r\nthe nature of a government, it is overturned. The oath of abjuration\r\ncomes close on the oath of allegiance. The association which was\r\nsubscribed yesterday is burned by the hangman to-day. In the midst of\r\nthe constant eddy and change, self-preservation becomes the first object\r\nof the adventurer. It is a task too hard for the strongest head to keep\r\nitself from becoming giddy in the eternal whirl. Public spirit is out of\r\nthe question. A laxity of principle, without which no public man can be\r\neminent or even safe, becomes too common to be scandalous; and the whole\r\nnation looks coolly on Instances of apostacy which would startle the\r\nfoulest turncoat of more settled times.\r\n\r\nThe history of France since the Revolution affords some striking\r\nillustrations of these remarks. The same man was a servant of the\r\nRepublic, of Bonaparte, of Lewis the Eighteenth, of Bonaparte again\r\nafter his return from Elba, of Lewis again after his return from Ghent.\r\nYet all these manifold treasons by no means seemed to destroy his\r\ninfluence, or even to fix any peculiar stain of infamy on his character.\r\nWe, to be sure, did not know what to make of him; but his countrymen\r\ndid not seem to be shocked; and in truth they had little right to be\r\nshocked: for there was scarcely one Frenchman distinguished in the state\r\nor in the army, who had not, according to the best of his talents and\r\nopportunities, emulated the example. It was natural, too, that this\r\nshould be the case. The rapidity and violence with which change followed\r\nchange in the affairs of France towards the close of the last century\r\nhad taken away the reproach of inconsistency, unfixed {515}the\r\nprinciples of public men, and produced in many minds a general\r\nscepticism and indifference about principles of government.\r\n\r\nNo Englishman who has studied attentively the reign of Charles the\r\nSecond will think himself entitled to indulge in any feelings of\r\nnational superiority over the _Dictionnaire des Girouettes_. Shaftesbury\r\nwas surely a far less respectable man than Talleyrand; and it would\r\nbe injustice even to Fouché to compare him with Lauderdale. Nothing,\r\nindeed, can more clearly show how low the standard of political\r\nmorality had fallen in this country than the fortunes of the two British\r\nstatesmen whom we have named. The government wanted a ruffian to carry\r\non the most atrocious system of mis-government with which any nation\r\nwas ever cursed, to extirpate Presbyterianism by fire and sword, by the\r\ndrowning of women, by the frightful torture of the boot. And they\r\nfound him among the chiefs of the rebellion and the subscribers of the\r\nCovenant. The opposition looked for a chief to head them in the most\r\ndesperate attacks ever made, under the forms of the Constitution, on\r\nany English administration: and they selected the minister who had the\r\ndeepest share in the worst acts of the Court, the soul of the Cabal, the\r\ncounsellor who had shut up the Exchequer and urged on the Dutch war. The\r\nwhole political drama was of the same cast. No unity of plan, no decent\r\npropriety of character and costume, could be found in that wild\r\nand monstrous harlequinade. The whole was made up of extravagant\r\ntransformations and burlesque contrasts; Atheists turned Puritans;\r\nPuritans turned Atheists; republicans defending the divine right of\r\nKings; prostitute courtiers clamouring for the liberties of the people;\r\njudges inflaming the rage of mobs; patriots pocketing {516}bribes from\r\nforeign powers; a Popish prince torturing Presbyterians into Episcopacy\r\nin one part of the island; Presbyterians cutting off the heads of Popish\r\nnoblemen and gentlemen in the other. Public opinion has its natural\r\nflux and reflux. After a violent burst, there is commonly a reaction. But\r\nvicissitudes so extraordinary as those which marked the reign of Charles\r\nthe Second can only be explained by supposing an utter want of principle\r\nin the political world. On neither side was there fidelity enough to\r\nface a reverse. Those honourable retreats from power which, in later\r\ndays, parties have often made, with loss, but still in good order, in\r\nfirm union, with unbroken spirit and formidable means of annoyance, were\r\nutterly unknown. As soon as a check took place a total rout followed:\r\narms and colours were thrown away. The vanquished troops, like the\r\nItalian mercenaries of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, enlisted\r\non the very field of battle, in the service of the conquerors. In a\r\nnation proud of its sturdy justice and plain good sense, no party could\r\nbe found to take a firm middle stand between the worst of oppositions\r\nand the worst of courts. When, on charges as wild as Mother Goose’s\r\ntales, on the testimony of wretches who proclaimed themselves to be\r\nspies and traitors, and whom everybody now believes to have been also\r\nliars and murderers, the offal of gaols and brothels, the leavings of\r\nthe hangman’s whip and shears, Catholics guilty of nothing but their\r\nreligion were led like sheep to the Protestant shambles, where were the\r\nloyal Tory gentry and the passively obedient clergy? And where, when the\r\ntime of retribution came, when laws were strained and juries packed\r\nto destroy the leaders of the Whigs, when charters were invaded, when\r\nJefferies and Kirke were making {517}Somersetshire what Lauderdale and\r\nGraham had made Scotland, where were the ten thousand brisk boys of\r\nShaftesbury, the members of ignoramus juries, the wearers of the Polish\r\nmedal? All-powerful to destroy others, unable to save themselves, the\r\nmembers of the two parties oppressed and were oppressed, murdered and\r\nwere murdered, in their turn. No lucid interval occurred between the\r\nfrantic paroxysms of two contradictory illusions.\r\n\r\nTo the frequent changes of the government during the twenty years which\r\nhad preceded the Restoration, this unsteadiness is in a great measure to\r\nbe attributed. Other causes had also been at work. Even if the country\r\nhad been governed by the house of Cromwell or by the remains of the Long\r\nParliament, the extreme austerity of the Puritans would necessarily have\r\nproduced a revulsion. Towards the close of the Protectorate many signs\r\nindicated that a time of license was at hand. But the restoration of\r\nCharles the Second rendered the change wonderfully rapid and violent.\r\nProfligacy became a test of orthodoxy and loyalty, a qualification for\r\nrank and office. A deep and general taint infected the morals of the\r\nmost influential classes, and spread itself through every province\r\nof letters. Poetry inflamed the passions; philosophy undermined the\r\nprinciples; divinity itself, inculcating an abject reverence for the\r\nCourt, gave additional effect to the licentious example of the Court.\r\nWe look in vain for those qualities which lend a charm to the errors\r\nof high and ardent natures, for the generosity, the tenderness, the\r\nchivalrous delicacy, which ennoble appetites into passions, and impart\r\nto vice itself a portion of the majesty of virtue. The excesses of that\r\nage remind us of the humours of a gang of footpads, revelling with their\r\n{518}favourite beauties at a flash-house. In the fashionable libertinism\r\nthere is a hard, cold ferocity, an impudence, a lowness, a dirtiness,\r\nwhich can be paralleled only among the heroes and heroines of that\r\nfilthy and heartless literature which encouraged it. One nobleman of\r\ngreat abilities wanders about as a Merry-Andrew. Another harangues the\r\nmob stark naked from a window. A third lays an ambush to cudgel a man\r\nwho has offended him. A knot of gentlemen of high rank and influence\r\ncombine to push their fortunes at court by circulating stories intended\r\nto ruin an innocent girl, stories which had no foundation, and which, if\r\nthey had been true, would never have passed the lips of a man of honour.\r\nA dead child is found in the palace, the offspring of some maid of\r\nhonour by some courtier, or perhaps by Charles himself. The whole flight\r\nof pandars and buffoons pounce upon it, and carry it in triumph to the\r\nroyal laboratory, where his Majesty, after a brutal jest, dissects it\r\nfor the amusement of the assembly, and probably of its father among\r\nthe rest. The favourite Duchess stamps about Whitehall, cursing and\r\nswearing. The ministers employ their time at the council-board in\r\nmaking mouths at each other and taking off each other’s gestures for the\r\namusement of the King. The Peers at a conference begin to pommel each\r\nother and to tear collars and periwigs. A speaker in the House of\r\nCommons gives offence to the Court. He is waylaid by a gang of bullies,\r\nand his nose is cut to the bone. This ignominous dissoluteness, or\r\nrather, if we may venture to designate it by the only proper word,\r\nblackguardism of feeling and manners, could not but spread from private\r\nto public life. The cynical sneers, the epicurean sophistry, which\r\nhad driven honour and virtue from one part of the character, extended\r\n{519}their influence over every other. The second generation of the\r\nstatesmen of this reign were worthy pupils of the schools in which they\r\nhad been trained, of the gaming-table of Grammont, and the tiring-room\r\nof Nell. In no other age could such a trifler as Buckingham have\r\nexercised any political influence. In no other age could the path\r\nto power and glory have been thrown open to the manifold infamies of\r\nChurchill.\r\n\r\nThe history of Churchill shows, more clearly per haps than that of any\r\nother individual, the malignity and extent of the corruption which had\r\neaten into the heart of the public morality. An English gentleman of\r\ngood family attaches himself to a Prince who has seduced his sister, and\r\naccepts rank and wealth as the price of her shame and his own. He then\r\nrepays by ingratitude the benefits which he has purchased by ignominy,\r\nbetrays his patron in a manner which the best cause cannot excuse, and\r\ncommits an act, not only of private treachery, but of distinct military\r\ndesertion. To his conduct at the crisis of the fate of James, no service\r\nin modern times has, as far as we remember, furnished any parallel. The\r\nconduct of Ney, scandalous enough no doubt, is the very fastidiousness\r\nof honour in comparison of it. The perfidy of Arnold approaches it\r\nmost nearly. In our age and country no talents, no services, no party\r\nattachments, could bear any man up under such mountains of infamy. Yet,\r\neven before Churchill had performed those great actions which in some\r\ndegree redeem his character with posterity, the load lay very lightly on\r\nhim. He had others in abundance to keep him in countenance. Godolphin,\r\nOrford, Dauby, the trimmer Halifax, the renegade Sunderland, were all\r\nmen of the same class.\r\n\r\nWhere such was the political morality of the noble {520}and the wealthy,\r\nit may easily be conceived that those professions which, even in the\r\nbest times, are peculiarly liable to corruption, were in a frightful\r\nstate. Such a bench and such a bar England has never seen. Jones,\r\nScroggs, Jefferies, North, Wright, Sawyer, Williams, are to this day the\r\nspots and blemishes of our legal chronicles. Differing in constitution\r\nand in situation, whether blustering or cringing, whether persecuting\r\nProtestants or Catholics, they were equally unprincipled and inhuman.\r\nThe part which the Church played was not equally atrocious; but it must\r\nhave been exquisitely diverting to a scoffer. Never were principles so\r\nloudly professed, and so shamelessly abandoned. The Royal prerogative\r\nhad been magnified to the skies in theological works. The doctrine\r\nof passive obedience had been preached from innumerable pulpits. The\r\nUniversity of Oxford had sentenced the works of the most moderate\r\nconstitutionalists to the flames. The accession of a Catholic King, the\r\nfrightful cruelties committed in the west of England, never shook the\r\nsteady loyalty of the clergy. But did they serve the Kino; for nought?\r\nHe laid his hand on them, and they cursed him to his face. He touched\r\nthe revenue of a college and the liberty of some prelates; and the whole\r\nprofession set up a yell worthy of Hugh Peters himself. Oxford sent her\r\nplate to an invader with more alacrity than she had shown when Charles\r\nthe First requested it. Nothing was said about the wickedness of\r\nresistance till resistance had done its work, till the anointed\r\nvicegerent of Heaven had been driven away, and till it had become plain\r\nthat he would never be restored, or would be restored at least under\r\nstrict limitations. The clergy went back, it must be owned, to their old\r\ntheory, as soon as they found that it would do them no harm. {521}It\r\nis principally to the general baseness and profligacy of the times that\r\nClarendon is indebted for his high reputation. He was, in every respect,\r\na man unfit for his age, at once too good for it and too bad for it. He\r\nseemed to be one of the ministers of Elizabeth, transplanted at once to\r\na state of society widely different from that in which the abilities of\r\nsuch ministers had been serviceable. In the sixteenth century, the Royal\r\nprerogative had scarcely been called in question. A Minister who held\r\nit high was in no danger, so long as he used it well. That attachment\r\nto the Crown, that extreme jealousy of popular encroachments, that love,\r\nhalf religious half political, for the Church, which, from the\r\nbeginning of the second session of the Long Parliament, showed itself in\r\nClarendon, and which his sufferings, his long residence in France,\r\nand his high station in the government, served to strengthen, would, a\r\nhundred years earlier, have secured to him the favour of his sovereign\r\nwithout rendering him odious to the people. His probity, his correctness\r\nin private life, his decency of deportment, and his general ability,\r\nwould not have misbecome a colleague of Walsingham and Burleigh. But,\r\nin the times on which he was cast, his errors and his virtues were alike\r\nout of place. He imprisoned men without trial. He was accused of raising\r\nunlawful contributions on the people for the support of the army. The\r\nabolition of the act which ensured the frequent holding of Parliaments\r\nwas one of his favourite objects. He seems to have meditated the revival\r\nof the Star Chamber and the High Commission Court. His zeal for the\r\nprerogative made him unpopular; but it could not secure to him the\r\nfavour of a master far more desirous of ease and pleasure than of\r\npower. {522}Charles would rather have lived in exile and privacy, with\r\nabundance of money, a crowd of mimics to amuse him, and a score of\r\nmistresses, than have purchased the absolute dominion of the world by\r\nthe privations and exertions to which Clarendon was constantly urging\r\nhim. A councillor who was always bringing him papers and giving him\r\nadvice, and who stoutly refused to compliment Lady Castlemaine and to\r\ncarry messages to Mistress Stewart, soon became more hateful to him than\r\never Cromwell had been. Thus, considered by the people as an oppressor,\r\nby the Court as a censor, the Minister fell from his high office with a\r\nruin more violent and destructive than could ever have been his fate, if\r\nhe had either respected the principles of the Constitution or flattered\r\nthe vices of the King.\r\n\r\nMr. Hallam has formed, we think, a most correct estimate of the\r\ncharacter and administration of Clarendon. But he scarcely makes\r\na sufficient allowance for the wear and tear which honesty almost\r\nnecessarily sustains in the friction of political life, and which, in\r\ntimes so rough as those through which Clarendon passed, must be very\r\nconsiderable. When these are fairly estimated, we think that his\r\nintegrity may be allowed to pass muster. A high-minded man he certainly\r\nwas not, either in public or in private affairs. His own account of his\r\nconduct in the affair of his daughter is the most extraordinary passage\r\nin autobiography. We except nothing even in the Confessions of Rousseau.\r\nSeveral writers have taken a perverted and absurd pride in representing\r\nthemselves as detestable; but no other ever laboured hard to make\r\nhimself despicable and ridiculous. In one important particular Clarendon\r\nshowed as little regard to the {523}honour of his country as he had\r\nshown to that of his family. He accepted a subsidy from France for the\r\nrelief of Portugal. But this method of obtaining money was afterwards\r\npractised to a much greater extent, and for objects much less\r\nrespectable, both by the Court and by the Opposition.\r\n\r\nThese pecuniary transactions are commonly considered as the most\r\ndisgraceful part of the history of those times; and they were no doubt\r\nhighly reprehensible. Yet, in justice to the Whigs and to Charles\r\nhimself, we must admit that they were not so shameful or atrocious as at\r\nthe present day they appear. The effect of violent animosities between\r\nparties has always been an indifference to the general welfare\r\nand honour of the State. A politician, where factions run high, is\r\ninterested not for the whole people, but for his own section of it.\r\nThe rest are, in his view, strangers, enemies, or rather pirates. The\r\nstrongest aversion which he can feel to any foreign power is the ardour\r\nof friendship, when compared with the loathing which he entertains\r\ntowards those domestic foes with whom he is cooped up in a narrow space,\r\nwith whom he lives in a constant interchange of petty injuries and\r\ninsults, and from whom, in the day of their success, he has to expect\r\nseverities far beyond any that a conqueror from a distant country would\r\ninflict. Thus, in Greece, it was a point of honour for a man to cleave\r\nto his party against his country. No aristocratical citizen of Samos\r\nor Corcyra would have hesitated to call in the aid of Lacedæmon. The\r\nmultitude, on the contrary, looked every where to Athens. In the Italian\r\nstates of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, from the same cause,\r\nno man was so much a Pisan or a Florentine as a Ghibeline or a Guelf. It\r\nmay be doubted whether {524}there was a single individual who would have\r\nscrupled to raise his party from a state of depression, by opening\r\nthe gates of his native city to a French or an Arragonese force. The\r\nReformation, dividing; almost every European country into’ two\r\nparts, produced similar effects. The Catholic was too strong for the\r\nEnglishman, the Huguenot for the Frenchman. The Protestant statesmen of\r\nScotland and France called in the aid of Elizabeth; and the Papists of\r\nthe League brought a Spanish army into the very heart of France. ‘The\r\ncommotions to which the French Revolution gave rise were followed by the\r\nsame consequences. The Republicans in every part of Europe were eager to\r\nsee the armies of the National Convention and the Directory appear among\r\nthem, and exulted in defeats which distressed and humbled those whom\r\nthey considered as their worst enemies, their own rulers. The princes\r\nand nobles of France, on the other hand, did their utmost to bring\r\nforeign invaders to Paris. A very short time has elapsed since the\r\nApostolical party in Spain invoked, too successfully, the support of\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nThe great contest which raged in England during the seventeenth century\r\nextinguished, not indeed in the body of the people, but in those classes\r\nwhich were most actively engaged in politics, almost all national\r\nfeelings. Charles the Second and many of his courtiers had passed a\r\nlarge part of their lives in banishment, living on the bounty of foreign\r\ntreasuries, soliciting foreign aid to reestablish monarchy in their\r\nnative country. The King’s own brother had fought in Flanders, under the\r\nbanners of Spain, against the English armies. The oppressed Cavaliers\r\nin England constantly looked to the Louvre and the Escurial for\r\n{525}deliverance and revenge. Clarendon censures the continental\r\ngovernments with great bitterness for not interfering in our internal\r\ndissensions. It is not strange, therefore, that, amidst the furious\r\ncontests which followed the Restoration, the violence of party feeling\r\nshould produce effects which would probably have attended it even in\r\nan age less distinguished by laxity of principle and indelicacy of\r\nsentiment. It was not till a natural death had terminated the paralytic\r\nold age of the Jacobite party that the evil was completely at an end.\r\nThe Whigs long looked to Holland, the High Tories to France. The\r\nformer concluded the Barrier Treaty; the latter entreated the Court\r\nof Versailles to send an expedition to England. Many men who, however\r\nerroneous their political notions might be, were unquestionably\r\nhonourable in private life, accepted money without scruple from the\r\nforeign powers favourable to the Pretender.\r\n\r\nNever was there less of national feeling among the higher orders than\r\nduring the reign of Charles the Second. That Prince, on the one side,\r\nthought it better to be the deputy of an absolute king than the King\r\nof a free people. Algernon Sydney, on the other hand, would gladly have\r\naided France in all her ambitious schemes, and have seen England reduced\r\nto the condition of a province, in the wild hope that a foreign despot\r\nwould assist him to establish his darling republic. The King took the\r\nmoney of France to assist him in the enterprise which he meditated\r\nagainst the liberty of his subjects, with as little scruple as Frederic\r\nof Prussia or Alexander of Russia accepted our subsidies in time of war.\r\nThe leaders of the Opposition no more thought themselves disgraced by\r\nthe presents of Lewis, than a gentleman of our own time {526}thinks\r\nhimself disgraced by the liberality of powerful and wealthy members of\r\nhis party who pay his election bill. The money which the King received\r\nfrom France had been largely employed to corrupt members of Parliament.\r\nThe enemies of the court might think it fair, or even absolutely\r\nnecessary, to encounter bribery with bribery. Thus they took the French\r\ngratuities, the needy among them for their own use, the rich probably\r\nfor the general purposes of the party, without any scruple. If we\r\ncompare their conduct not with that of English statesmen in our own\r\ntime, but with that of persons in those foreign countries which are\r\nnow situated as England then was, we shall probably see reason to abate\r\nsomething of the severity of censure with which it has been the fashion\r\nto visit those proceedings. Yet, when every allowance is made, the\r\ntransaction is sufficiently offensive. It is satisfactory to find that\r\nLord Russell stands free from any imputation of personal participation\r\nin the spoil. An age so miserably poor in all the moral qualities which\r\nrender public characters respectable can ill spare the credit which it\r\nderives from a man, not indeed conspicuous for talents or knowledge,\r\nbut honest even in his errors, respectable in every relation of life,\r\nrationally pious, steadily and placidly brave.\r\n\r\nThe great improvement which took place in our breed of public men is\r\nprincipally to be ascribed to the Revolution. Yet that memorable event,\r\nin a great measure, took its character from the very vices which it\r\nwas the means of reforming. It was assuredly a happy revolution, and\r\na useful revolution; but it was not, what it has often been called, a\r\nglorious revolution. William, and William alone, derived glory from\r\nit. {527}The transaction was, in almost every part, discreditable to\r\nEngland. That a tyrant who had violated the fundamental laws of the\r\ncountry, who had attacked the rights of its greatest corporations, who\r\nhad begun to persecute the established religion of the state, who had\r\nnever respected the law either in his superstition or in his revenge,\r\ncould not be pulled down without the aid of a foreign army, is a\r\ncircumstance not very grateful to our national pride. Yet this is the\r\nleast degrading part of the story. The shameless insincerity of the\r\ngreat and noble, the warm assurances of general support which James\r\nreceived, down to the moment of general desertion, indicate a meanness\r\nof spirit and a looseness of morality most disgraceful to the age. That\r\nthe enterprise succeeded, at least that it succeeded without bloodshed\r\nor commotion, was principally owing to an act of ungrateful perfidy,\r\nsuch as no soldier had ever before committed, and to those monstrous\r\nfictions respecting the birth of the Prince of Wales which persons of\r\nthe highest rank were not ashamed to circulate. In all the proceedings\r\nof the Convention, in the conference particularly, we see that\r\nlittleness of mind which is the chief characteristic of the times. The\r\nresolutions on which the two Houses at last agreed were as bad as\r\nany resolutions for so excellent a purpose could be. Their feeble and\r\ncontradictory language was evidently intended to save the credit of\r\nthe Tories, who were ashamed to name what they were not ashamed to do.\r\nThrough the whole transaction no commanding talents were displayed by\r\nany Englishman; no extraordinary risks were run; no sacrifices were made\r\nfor the deliverance of the nation, except the sacrifice which Churchill\r\nmade of honour, and Anne of natural affection. {528}It was in some sense\r\nfortunate, as we have already said, for the Church of England, that the\r\nReformation in this country was effected by men who cared little about\r\nreligion. And, in the same manner, it was fortunate for our civil\r\ngovernment that the Revolution was in a great measure effected by men\r\nwho cared little about their political principles. At such a crisis,\r\nsplendid talents and strong passions might have done more harm than\r\ngood. There was far greater reason to fear that too much would be\r\nattempted, and that violent movements would produce an equally violent\r\nreaction, than that too little would be done in the way of change. But\r\nnarrowness of intellect and flexibility of principle, though they may be\r\nserviceable, can never be respectable.\r\n\r\nIf in the Revolution itself there was little that can properly be called\r\nglorious, there was still less in the events which followed. In a church\r\nwhich had as one man declared the doctrine of resistance unchristian,\r\nonly four hundred persons refused to take the oath of allegiance to a\r\ngovernment founded on resistance. In the preceding generation, both the\r\nEpiscopal and the Presbyterian clergy, rather than concede points of\r\nconscience not more important, had resigned their livings by thousands.\r\n\r\nThe churchmen, at the time of the Revolution, justified their conduct by\r\nall those profligate sophisms which are called Jesuitical, and which are\r\ncommonly reckoned among the peculiar sins of Popery, but which in\r\nfact are every where the anodynes employed by minds rather subtle than\r\nstrong, to quiet those internal twinges which they cannot but feel and\r\nwhich they will not obey. As the oath taken by the clergy was in the\r\nteeth of their principles, so was their conduct {529}in the teeth of\r\ntheir oath. Their constant machinations against the Government to\r\nwhich they had sworn fidelity brought a reproach on their order and on\r\nChristianity itself. A distinguished prelate has not scrupled to say\r\nthat the rapid increase of infidelity at that time was principally\r\nproduced by the disgust which the faithless conduct of his brethren\r\nexcited in men not sufficiently candid or judicious to discern the\r\nbeauties of the system amidst the vices of its ministers.\r\n\r\nBut the reproach was not confined to the Church. In every political\r\nparty, in the Cabinet itself, duplicity and perfidy abounded. The\r\nvery men whom William loaded with benefits and in whom he reposed\r\nmost confidence, with his seals of office in their hands, kept up a\r\ncorrespondence with the exiled family. Orford, Leeds, and Shrewsbury\r\nwere guilty of this odious treachery. Even Devonshire is not altogether\r\nfree from suspicion. It may well be conceived that, at such a time,\r\nsuch a nature as that of Marlborough would riot in the very luxury of\r\nbaseness. His former treason, thoroughly furnished with all that makes\r\ninfamy exquisite, placed him under the disadvantage which attends every\r\nartist from the time that he produces a masterpiece. Yet his second\r\ngreat stroke may excite wonder, even in those who appreciate all the\r\nmerit of the first. Lest his admirers should be able to say that at\r\nthe time of the Revolution he had betrayed his King from any other\r\nthan selfish motives, he proceeded to betray his country. He sent\r\nintelligence to the French court of a secret expedition intended to\r\nattack Brest. The consequence was that the expedition failed, and that\r\neight hundred British soldiers lost their lives from the abandoned\r\nvillany of a British general. Yet this man has been canonized by so\r\nmany eminent writers that {530}to speak of him as he deserves may seem\r\nscarcely decent.\r\n\r\nThe reign of William the Third, as Mr. Hallam happily says, was the\r\nNadir of the national prosperity. It was also the Nadir of the national\r\ncharacter. It was the time when the rank harvest of vices sown during\r\nthirty years of licentiousness and confusion was gathered in; but it was\r\nalso the seed-time of great virtues.\r\n\r\nThe press was emancipated from the censorship soon after the Revolution;\r\nand the Government immediately fell under the censorship of the press.\r\nStatesmen had a scrutiny to endure which was every day becoming more and\r\nmore severe. The extreme violence of opinions abated. The Whigs learned\r\nmoderation in office; the Tories learned the principles of liberty\r\nin opposition. The parties almost constantly approximated, often met,\r\nsometimes crossed each other. There were occasional bursts of violence;\r\nbut, from the time of the Revolution, those bursts were constantly\r\nbecoming less and less terrible. The severity with which the Tories, at\r\nthe close of the reign of Anne, treated some of those who had directed\r\npublic affairs during the war of the Grand Alliance, and the retaliatory\r\nmeasures of the Whigs, after the accession of the House of Hanover,\r\ncannot be justified; but they were by no means in the style of the\r\ninfuriated parties, whose alternate murders had disgraced our history\r\ntowards the close of the reign of Charles the Second. At the fall of\r\nWalpole far greater moderation was displayed. And from that time it has\r\nbeen the practice, a practice not strictly according to the theory\r\nof our Constitution, but still most salutary, to consider the loss of\r\noffice, and the public disapprobation, as punishments sufficient for\r\nerrors in the administration not imputable to personal {531}corruption.\r\nNothing, we believe, has contributed more than this lenity to raise\r\nthe character of public men. Ambition is of itself a game sufficiently\r\nhazardous and sufficiently deep to inflame the passions without adding\r\nproperty, life, and liberty to the stake. Where the play runs so\r\ndesperately high as in the seventeenth century, honour is at an end.\r\nStatesmen, instead of being as they should be, at once mild and steady,\r\nare at once ferocious and inconsistent. The axe is for ever before their\r\neyes. A popular outcry sometimes unnerves them, and sometimes makes them\r\ndesperate; it drives them to unworthy compliances, or to measures of\r\nvengeance as cruel as those which they have reason to expect. A Minister\r\nin our times need not fear either to be firm or to be merciful. Our old\r\npolicy in this respect was as absurd as that of the king in the Eastern\r\ntale who proclaimed that any physician who pleased might come to court\r\nand prescribe for his diseases, but that if the remedies failed the\r\nadventurer should lose his head. It is easy to conceive how many able\r\nmen would refuse to undertake the cure on such conditions; how much the\r\nsense of extreme danger would confuse the perceptions, and cloud the\r\nintellect, of the practitioner, at the very crisis which most called\r\nfor self-possession, and how strong his temptation would be, if he found\r\nthat he had committed a blunder, to escape the consequences of it by\r\npoisoning his patient.\r\n\r\nBut in fact it would have been impossible, since the Revolution, to\r\npunish any Minister for the general course of his policy, with the\r\nslightest semblance of justice; for since that time no Minister has been\r\nable to pursue any general course of policy without the approbation of\r\nthe Parliament. The most important effects of that great change were, as\r\nMr. Hallam has {532}most truly said and most ably shown, those which\r\nit indirectly produced. Thenceforward it became the interest of the\r\nexecutive government to protect those very doctrines which an executive\r\ngovernment is in general inclined to persecute. The sovereign, the\r\nministers, the courtiers, at last even the universities and the clergy,\r\nwere changed into advocates of the right of resistance. In the theory of\r\nthe Whigs, in the situation of the Tories, in the common interest of all\r\npublic men, the Parliamentary constitution of the country found perfect\r\nsecurity. The power of the House of Commons, in particular, has been\r\nsteadily on the increase. Since supplies have been granted for short\r\nterms and appropriated to particular services, the approbation of that\r\nHouse has been as necessary in practice to the executive administration\r\nas it has al-ways been in theory to taxes and to laws.\r\n\r\nMr. Hallam appears to have begun with the reign of Henry the Seventh, as\r\nthe period at which what is called modern history, in contradistinction\r\nto the history of the middle ages, is generally supposed to commence. He\r\nhas stopped at the accession of George the Third, “from unwillingness,”\r\n as he says, “to excite the prejudices of modern politics, especially\r\nthose connected with personal character.” These two eras, we think,\r\ndeserved the distinction on other grounds. Our remote posterity, when\r\nlooking back on our history in that comprehensive manner in which remote\r\nposterity alone can, without much danger of error, look back on it, will\r\nprobably observe those points with peculiar interest. They are, if we\r\nmistake not, the beginning and the end of an entire and separate chapter\r\nin our annals. The period which lies between them is a perfect cycle, a\r\ngreat year of the public mind. {533}In the reign of Henry the Seventh,\r\nall the political differences which had agitated England since the\r\nNorman conquest seemed to be set at rest. The long and fierce struggle\r\nbetween the Crown and the Barons had terminated. The grievances which\r\nhad produced the rebellions of Tyler and Cade had disappeared.\r\nVilanage was scarcely known. The two royal houses, whose conflicting\r\nclaims had long convulsed the kingdom, were at length united. The\r\nclaimants whose pretensions, just or unjust, had disturbed the new\r\nsettlement, were overthrown. In religion there was no open dissent, and\r\nprobably very little secret heresy. The old subjects of contention, in\r\nshort, had vanished; those which were to succeed had not yet appeared.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, new principles were announced; principles which were\r\ndestined to keep England during two centuries and a half in a state of\r\ncommotion. The Reformation divided the people into two great parties.\r\nThe Protestants were victorious. They again subdivided themselves.\r\nPolitical factions were engrafted on theological sects. The mutual\r\nanimosities of the two parties gradually emerged into the light of\r\npublic life. First came conflicts in Parliament; then civil war; then\r\nrevolutions upon revolutions, each attended by its appurtenance of\r\nproscriptions, and persecutions, and tests; each followed by severe\r\nmeasures on the part of the conquerors; each exciting a deadly and\r\nfestering hatred in the conquered. During the reign of George the\r\nSecond, things were evidently tending to repose. At the close of that\r\nreign, the nation had completed the great revolution which commenced in\r\nthe early part of the sixteenth century, and was again at rest. The fury\r\nof sects had died away. The Catholics themselves practically enjoyed\r\ntoleration; and more {534}than toleration they did not yet venture even\r\nto desire. Jacobitism was a mere name. Nobody was left to fight for\r\nthat wretched cause, and very few to drink for it. The Constitution,\r\npurchased so dearly, was on every side extolled and worshipped. Even\r\nthose distinctions of party which must almost always be found in a free\r\nstate could scarcely be traced. The two great bodies which, from the\r\ntime of the Revolution, had been gradually tending to approximation,\r\nwere now united in emulous support of that splendid Administration which\r\nsmote to the dust both the branches of the House of Bourbon. The great\r\nbattle for our ecclesiastical and civil polity had been fought and\r\nwon. The wounds had been healed. The victors and the vanquished were\r\nrejoicing together. Every person acquainted with the political writers\r\nof the last generation will recollect the terms in which they generally\r\nspeak of that time. It was a glimpse of a golden age of union and\r\nglory, a short interval of rest, which had been preceded by centuries of\r\nagitation, and which centuries of agitation were destined to follow.\r\n\r\nHow soon faction again began to ferment is well known. In the Letters of\r\nJunius, in Burke’s Thoughts on the Cause of the Discontents, and in many\r\nother writings of less merit, the violent dissensions which speedily\r\nconvulsed the country are imputed to the system of favouritism which\r\nGeorge the Third introduced, to the influence of Bute, or to the\r\nprofligacy of those who called themselves the King’s friends. With\r\nall deference to the eminent writers to whom we have referred, we may\r\nventure to say that they lived too near the events of which they treated\r\nto judge correctly. The schism which was then appearing in the nation,\r\nand which has been from that time almost constantly {535}widening, had\r\nlittle in common with those schisms which had divided it during the\r\nreigns of the Tudors and the Stuarts. The symptoms of popular feeling,\r\nindeed, will always be in a great measure the same; but the principle\r\nwhich excited that feeling was here new. The support which was given to\r\nWilkes, the clamour for reform during the American war, the disaffected\r\nconduct of large classes of people at the time of the French Revolution,\r\nno more resembled the opposition which had been offered to the government\r\nof Charles the Second, than that opposition resembled the contest\r\nbetween the Roses.\r\n\r\nIn the political as in the natural body, a sensation is often referred\r\nto a part widely different from that in which it really resides. A man\r\nwhose leg is cut off fancies that he feels a pain in his toe. And in the\r\nsame manner the people, in the earlier part of the late reign, sincerely\r\nattributed their discontent to grievances which had been effectually\r\nlopped off. They imagined that the prerogative was too strong for the\r\nConstitution, that the principles of the Revolution were abandoned, that\r\nthe system of the Stuarts was restored. Every impartial man must now\r\nacknowledge that these charges were groundless. The conduct of the\r\nGovernment with respect to the Middlesex election would have been\r\ncontemplated with delight by the first generation of Whigs. They would\r\nhave thought it a splendid triumph of the cause of liberty that the\r\nKing and the Lords should resign to the lower House a portion of the\r\nlegislative power, and allow it to incapacitate without their consent.\r\nThis, indeed, Mr. Burke clearly perceived. “When the House of Commons,”\r\n says he, “in an endeavour to obtain new advantages at the expense of the\r\nother orders of the {536}state, for the benefit of the commons at large,\r\nhave pursued strong measures, if it were not just, it was at least\r\nnatural, that the constituents should connive at all their proceedings;\r\nbecause we ourselves were ultimately to profit. But when this submission\r\nis urged to us in a contest between the representatives and ourselves,\r\nand where nothing can be put into their scale which is not taken from\r\nours, they fancy us to be children when they tell us that they are our\r\nrepresentatives, our own flesh and blood, and that all the stripes they\r\ngive us are for our good.” These sentences contain, in fact, the whole\r\nexplanation of the mystery. The conflict of the seventeenth century\r\nwas maintained by the Parliament against the Crown. The conflict which\r\ncommenced in the middle of the eighteenth century, which still remains\r\nundecided, and in which our children and grandchildren will probably be\r\ncalled to act or to suffer, is between a large portion of the people on\r\nthe one side, and the Crown and the Parliament united on the other.\r\n\r\nThe privileges of the House of Commons, those privileges which, in\r\n1642, all London rose in arms to defend, which the people considered\r\nas synonymous with their own liberties, and in comparison of which they\r\ntook no account of the most precious and sacred principles of English\r\njurisprudence, have now become nearly as odious as the rigours of\r\nmartial law. That power of committing which the people anciently loved\r\nto see the House of Commons exercise, is now, at least when employed\r\nagainst libellers, the most unpopular power in the Constitution. If the\r\nCommons were to suffer the Lords to amend money-bills, we do not believe\r\nthat the people would care one straw about the matter. If they were to\r\nsuffer the Lords even to originate {537}money-bills, we doubt whether\r\nsuch a surrender of their constitutional rights would excite half\r\nso much dissatisfaction as the exclusion of strangers from a single\r\nimportant discussion. The gallery in which the reporters sit has become\r\na fourth estate of the realm. The publication of the debates, a practice\r\nwhich seemed to the most liberal statesman of the old school full of\r\ndanger to the great safeguards of public liberty, is now regarded by\r\nmany persons as a safeguard tantamount, and more than tantamount, to all\r\nthe rest together.\r\n\r\nBurke, in a speech on parliamentary reform which is the more remarkable\r\nbecause it was delivered long before the French Revolution, has\r\ndescribed, in striking language, the change in public feeling of which\r\nwe speak. “It suggests melancholy reflections,” says he, “in consequence\r\nof the strange course we have long held, that we are now no longer\r\nquarreling about the character, or about the conduct of men, or the\r\ntenour of measures; but we are grown out of humour with the English\r\nConstitution itself; this is become the object of the animosity of\r\nEnglishmen. This constitution in former days used to be the envy of the\r\nworld; it was the pattern for politicians; the theme of the eloquent;\r\nthe meditation of the philosopher in every part of the world. As to\r\nEnglishmen, it was their pride, their consolation. By it they lived, and\r\nfor it they were ready to die. Its defects, if it had any, were partly\r\ncovered by partiality, and partly borne by prudence. Now all its\r\nexcellencies are forgot, its faults are forcibly dragged into day,\r\nexaggerated by every artifice of misrepresentation. It is despised and\r\nrejected of men; and every device and invention of ingenuity or idleness\r\nis set up in opposition, or in preference to it.” We neither adopt nor\r\ncondemn the {538}language of reprobation which the great orator here\r\nemploys. We call him only as a witness to the fact. That the\r\nrevolution of public feeling which he described was then in progress is\r\nindisputable; and it is equally indisputable, we think, that it is in\r\nprogress still.\r\n\r\nTo investigate and classify the causes of so great a change would\r\nrequire far more thought, and far more space, than we at present have\r\nto bestow. But some of them are obvious. During the contest which the\r\nParliament carried on against the Stuarts, it had only to check and\r\ncomplain. It has since had to govern. As an attacking body, it could\r\nselect its points of attack, and it naturally chose those on which it\r\nwas likely to receive public support. As a ruling body, it has neither\r\nthe same liberty of choice, nor the same motives to gratify the people.\r\nWith the power of an executive government, it has drawn to itself some\r\nof the vices, and all the unpopularity of an executive government. On\r\nthe House of Commons above all, possessed as it is of the public purse,\r\nand consequently of the public sword, the nation throws all the blame\r\nof an ill conducted war, of a blundering negotiation, of a disgraceful\r\ntreaty, of an embarrassing commercial crisis. The delays of the Court of\r\nChancery, the misconduct of a judge at Van Diemen’s Land, any thing,\r\nin short, which in any part of the administration any person feels as a\r\ngrievance, is attributed to the tyranny! or at least to the negligence,\r\nof that all-powerful body. Private individuals pester it with their\r\nwrongs and claims. A merchant appeals to it from the Courts of Rio\r\nJaneiro or St. Petersburgh. A historical painter complains to it that\r\nhis department of art finds no encouragement. Anciently the Parliament\r\nresembled a {539}member of opposition, from whom no places are expected,\r\nwho is not expected to confer favours and propose measures, but merely\r\nto watch and censure, and who may, therefore, unless he is grossly\r\ninjudicious, be popular with the great body of the community. The\r\nParliament now resembles the same person put into office, surrounded by\r\npetitioners whom twenty times his patronage would not satisfy, stunned\r\nwith complaints, buried in memorials, compelled by the duties of his\r\nstation to bring forward measures similar to those which he was formerly\r\naccustomed to observe and to check, and perpetually encountered by\r\nobjections similar to those which it was formerly his business to raise.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be laid down as a general rule that a legislative\r\nassembly, not constituted on democratical principles, cannot be popular\r\nlong after it ceases to be weak. Its zeal for what the people, rightly\r\nor wrongly, conceive to be their interests, its sympathy with their\r\nmutable and violent passions, are merely the effects of the particular\r\ncircumstances in which it is placed. As long as it depends for existence\r\non the public favour, it will employ all the means in its power\r\nto conciliate that favour. While this is the case, defects in its\r\nconstitution are of little consequence. But, as the close union of such\r\na body with the nation is the effect of an identity of interests not\r\nessential but accidental, it is in some measure dissolved from the time\r\nat which the danger which produced it ceases to exist.\r\n\r\nHence, before the Revolution, the question of Parliamentary reform was\r\nof very little importance. The friends of liberty had no very ardent\r\nwish for reform. The strongest Tories saw no objections to it. It is\r\nremarkable that Clarendon loudly applauds the changes which Cromwell\r\nintroduced, changes far stronger than {540}the Whigs of the present day\r\nwould in general approve. There is no reason to think, however, that the\r\nreform effected by Cromwell made any great difference in the conduct of\r\nthe Parliament. Indeed, if the House of Commons had, during the reign\r\nof Charles the Second, been elected by universal suffrage, or if all the\r\nseats had been put up to sale, as in the French Parliaments, it would,\r\nwe suspect, have acted very much as it did. We know how strongly the\r\nParliament of Paris exerted itself in favour of the people on many\r\nimportant occasions; and the reason is evident. Though it did not\r\nemanate from the people, its whole consequence depended on the support\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the Revolution the House of Commons has been gradually\r\nbecoming what it now is, a great council of state, containing many\r\nmembers chosen freely by the people, and many others anxious to acquire\r\nthe favour of the people; but, on the whole, aristocratical in its\r\ntemper and interest. It is very far from being an illiberal and stupid\r\noligarchy; but it is equally far from being an express image of the\r\ngeneral feeling. It is influenced by the opinion of the people,\r\nand influenced powerfully, but slowly and circuitously. Instead of\r\noutrunning the public mind; as before the Revolution it frequently did,\r\nit now follows with slow steps and at a wide distance. It is therefore\r\nnecessarily unpopular; and the more so because the good which it\r\nproduces is much less evident to common perception than the evil which\r\nit inflicts. It bears the blame of all the mischief which is done, or\r\nsupposed to be done, by its authority or by its connivance. It does not\r\nget the credit, on the other hand, of having prevented those innumerable\r\nabuses which do not exist solely because the House of Commons exists.\r\n{541}A large part of the nation is certainly desirous of a reform in the\r\nrepresentative system. How large that part may be, and how strong its\r\ndesires on the subject may be, it is difficult to say. It is only at\r\nintervals that the clamour on the subject is loud and vehement. But it\r\nseems to us that, during the remissions, the feeling gathers strength,\r\nand that every successive burst is more violent than that which preceded\r\nit. The public attention may be for a time diverted to the Catholic\r\nclaims or the Mercantile code; but it is probable that at no very\r\ndistant period, perhaps in the lifetime of the present generation,\r\nall other questions will merge in that which is, in a certain degree,\r\nconnected with them all.\r\n\r\nAlready we seem to ourselves to perceive the signs of unquiet times,\r\nthe vague presentiment of something great and strange which pervades the\r\ncommunity, the restless and turbid hopes of those who have every thing\r\nto gain, the dimly hinted forebodings of those who have every thing\r\nto lose. Many indications might be mentioned, in themselves indeed as\r\ninsignificant as straws; but even the direction of a straw, to borrow\r\nthe illustration of Bacon, will show from what quarter the storm is\r\nsetting in.\r\n\r\nA great statesman might, by judicious and timely reformations, by\r\nreconciling the two great branches of the natural aristocracy, the\r\ncapitalists and the landowners, and by so widening the base of the\r\ngovernment as to interest in its defence the whole of the middle class,\r\nthat brave, honest, and sound-hearted class, which is as anxious for the\r\nmaintenance of order and the security of property, as it is hostile to\r\ncorruption and oppression, succeed in averting a struggle to which no\r\nrational friend of liberty or of law can look forward without {542}great\r\napprehensions. There are those who will be contented with nothing but\r\ndemolition; and there are those who shrink from all repair. There are\r\ninnovators who long for a President and a National Convention; and there\r\nare bigots who, while cities larger and richer than the capitals of many\r\ngreat kingdoms are calling out for representatives to watch over their\r\ninterests, select some hackneyed jobber in boroughs, some peer of the\r\nnarrowest and smallest mind, as the fittest depositary of a forfeited\r\nfranchise. Between these extremes there lies a more excellent way. Time\r\nis bringing round another crisis analogous to that which occurred in the\r\nseventeenth century. We stand in a situation similar to that in which\r\nour ancestors stood under the reign of James the First. It will\r\nsoon again be necessary to reform that we may preserve, to save the\r\nfundamental principles of the Constitution by alterations in the\r\nsubordinate parts. It will then be possible, as it was possible two\r\nhundred years ago, to protect vested rights, to secure every useful\r\ninstitution, every institution endeared by antiquity and noble\r\nassociations, and, at the same time, to introduce into the system\r\nimprovements harmonizing with the original plan. It remains to be seen\r\nwhether two hundred years have made us wiser.\r\n\r\nWe know of no great revolution which might not have been prevented by\r\ncompromise early and graciously made. Firmness is a great virtue\r\nin public affairs; but it has its proper sphere. Conspiracies and\r\ninsurrections in which small minorities are engaged, the outbreakings of\r\npopular violence unconnected with any extensive project or any durable\r\nprinciple, are best repressed by vigour and decision. To shrink from\r\nthem is to make them formidable. But no wise ruler will {543}confound\r\nthe pervading taint with the slight local irritation. No wise ruler will\r\ntreat the deeply seated discontents of a great party, as he treats the\r\nfury of a mob which destroys mills and power-looms. The neglect of this\r\ndistinction has been fatal even to governments strong in the power of\r\nthe sword. The present time is indeed a time of peace and order. But\r\nit is at such a time that fools are most thoughtless and wise men most\r\nthoughtful. That the discontents which have agitated the country during\r\nthe late and the present reign, and which, though not always noisy, are\r\nnever wholly dormant, will again break forth with aggravated symptoms,\r\nis almost as certain as that the tides and seasons will follow their\r\nappointed course. But in all movements of the human mind which tend to\r\ngreat revolutions there is a crisis at which moderate concession may\r\namend, conciliate, and preserve. Happy will it be for England if, at\r\nthat crisis, her interests be confided to men for whom history has not\r\nrecorded the long series of human crimes and follies in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. 1.",
