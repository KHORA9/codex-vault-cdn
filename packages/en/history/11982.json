What may prove a\r\nsudden awakening to one, giving an impulse in a certain direction that\r\nmay last for years, may make no impression on another. People wonder why\r\nthe children of the same family differ so widely, though they have had\r\nthe same domestic discipline, the same school and church teaching, and\r\nhave grown up under the same influences and with the same environments.\r\nAs well wonder why lilies and lilacs in the same latitude are not all\r\nalike in color and equally fragrant. Children differ as widely as these\r\nin the primal elements of their physical and psychical life.\r\n\r\nWho can estimate the power of antenatal influences, or the child's\r\nsurroundings in its earliest years, the effect of some passing word or\r\nsight on one, that makes no impression on another? The unhappiness of\r\none child under a certain home discipline is not inconsistent with the\r\ncontent of another under this same discipline. One, yearning for broader\r\nfreedom, is in a chronic condition of rebellion; the other, more easily\r\nsatisfied, quietly accepts the situation. Everything is seen from a\r\ndifferent standpoint; everything takes its color from the mind of the\r\nbeholder.\r\n\r\nI am moved to recall what I can of my early days, what I thought and\r\nfelt, that grown people may have a better understanding of children and\r\ndo more for their happiness and development. I see so much tyranny\r\nexercised over children, even by well-disposed parents, and in so many\r\nvaried forms,--a tyranny to which these parents are themselves\r\ninsensible,--that I desire to paint my joys and sorrows in as vivid\r\ncolors as possible, in the hope that I may do something to defend the\r\nweak from the strong. People never dream of all that is going on in the\r\nlittle heads of the young, for few adults are given to introspection,\r\nand those who are incapable of recalling their own feelings under\r\nrestraint and disappointment can have no appreciation of the sufferings\r\nof children who can neither describe nor analyze what they feel. In\r\ndefending themselves against injustice they are as helpless as dumb\r\nanimals. What is insignificant to their elders is often to them a source\r\nof great joy or sorrow.\r\n\r\nWith several generations of vigorous, enterprising ancestors behind me,\r\nI commenced the struggle of life under favorable circumstances on the\r\n12th day of November, 1815, the same year that my father, Daniel Cady, a\r\ndistinguished lawyer and judge in the State of New York, was elected to\r\nCongress. Perhaps the excitement of a political campaign, in which my\r\nmother took the deepest interest, may have had an influence on my\r\nprenatal life and given me the strong desire that I have always felt to\r\nparticipate in the rights and duties of government.\r\n\r\nMy father was a man of firm character and unimpeachable integrity, and\r\nyet sensitive and modest to a painful degree. There were but two places\r\nin which he felt at ease--in the courthouse and at his own fireside.\r\nThough gentle and tender, he had such a dignified repose and reserve of\r\nmanner that, as children, we regarded him with fear rather than\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nMy mother, Margaret Livingston, a tall, queenly looking woman, was\r\ncourageous, self-reliant, and at her ease under all circumstances and in\r\nall places. She was the daughter of Colonel James Livingston, who took\r\nan active part in the War of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nColonel Livingston was stationed at West Point when Arnold made the\r\nattempt to betray that stronghold into the hands of the enemy. In the\r\nabsence of General Washington and his superior officer, he took the\r\nresponsibility of firing into the _Vulture_, a suspicious looking\r\nBritish vessel that lay at anchor near the opposite bank of the Hudson\r\nRiver. It was a fatal shot for André, the British spy, with whom Arnold\r\nwas then consummating his treason. Hit between wind and water, the\r\nvessel spread her sails and hastened down the river, leaving André, with\r\nhis papers, to be captured while Arnold made his escape through the\r\nlines, before his treason was suspected.\r\n\r\nOn General Washington's return to West Point, he sent for my grandfather\r\nand reprimanded him for acting in so important a matter without orders,\r\nthereby making himself liable to court-martial; but, after fully\r\nimpressing the young officer with the danger of such self-sufficiency on\r\nordinary occasions, he admitted that a most fortunate shot had been sent\r\ninto the _Vulture_, \"for,\" he said, \"we are in no condition just now to\r\ndefend ourselves against the British forces in New York, and the\r\ncapture of this spy has saved us.\"\r\n\r\nMy mother had the military idea of government, but her children, like\r\ntheir grandfather, were disposed to assume the responsibility of their\r\nown actions; thus the ancestral traits in mother and children modified,\r\nin a measure, the dangerous tendencies in each.\r\n\r\nOur parents were as kind, indulgent, and considerate as the Puritan\r\nideas of those days permitted, but fear, rather than love, of God and\r\nparents alike, predominated. Add to this our timidity in our intercourse\r\nwith servants and teachers, our dread of the ever present devil, and the\r\nreader will see that, under such conditions, nothing but strong\r\nself-will and a good share of hope and mirthfulness could have saved an\r\nordinary child from becoming a mere nullity.\r\n\r\nThe first event engraved on my memory was the birth of a sister when I\r\nwas four years old. It was a cold morning in January when the brawny\r\nScotch nurse carried me to see the little stranger, whose advent was a\r\nmatter of intense interest to me for many weeks after. The large,\r\npleasant room with the white curtains and bright wood fire on the\r\nhearth, where panada, catnip, and all kinds of little messes which we\r\nwere allowed to taste were kept warm, was the center of attraction for\r\nthe older children. I heard so many friends remark, \"What a pity it is\r\nshe's a girl!\" that I felt a kind of compassion for the little baby.\r\nTrue, our family consisted of five girls and only one boy, but I did not\r\nunderstand at that time that girls were considered an inferior order of\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nTo form some idea of my surroundings at this time, imagine a two-story\r\nwhite frame house with a hall through the middle, rooms on either side,\r\nand a large back building with grounds on the side and rear, which\r\njoined the garden of our good Presbyterian minister, the Rev. Simon\r\nHosack, of whom I shall have more to say in another chapter. Our\r\nfavorite resorts in the house were the garret and cellar. In the former\r\nwere barrels of hickory nuts, and, on a long shelf, large cakes of maple\r\nsugar and all kinds of dried herbs and sweet flag; spinning wheels, a\r\nnumber of small white cotton bags filled with bundles, marked in ink,\r\n\"silk,\" \"cotton,\" \"flannel,\" \"calico,\" etc., as well as ancient\r\nmasculine and feminine costumes. Here we would crack the nuts, nibble\r\nthe sharp edges of the maple sugar, chew some favorite herb, play ball\r\nwith the bags, whirl the old spinning wheels, dress up in our ancestors'\r\nclothes, and take a bird's-eye view of the surrounding country from an\r\nenticing scuttle hole. This was forbidden ground; but, nevertheless, we\r\noften went there on the sly, which only made the little escapades more\r\nenjoyable.\r\n\r\nThe cellar of our house was filled, in winter, with barrels of apples,\r\nvegetables, salt meats, cider, butter, pounding barrels, washtubs, etc.,\r\noffering admirable nooks for playing hide and seek. Two tallow candles\r\nthrew a faint light over the scene on certain occasions. This cellar was\r\non a level with a large kitchen where we played blind man's buff and\r\nother games when the day's work was done. These two rooms are the center\r\nof many of the merriest memories of my childhood days.\r\n\r\nI can recall three colored men, Abraham, Peter, and Jacob, who acted as\r\nmenservants in our youth. In turn they would sometimes play on the banjo\r\nfor us to dance, taking real enjoyment in our games. They are all at\r\nrest now with \"Old Uncle Ned in the place where the good niggers go.\"\r\nOur nurses, Lockey Danford, Polly Bell, Mary Dunn, and Cornelia\r\nNickeloy--peace to their ashes--were the only shadows on the gayety of\r\nthese winter evenings; for their chief delight was to hurry us off to\r\nbed, that they might receive their beaux or make short calls in the\r\nneighborhood. My memory of them is mingled with no sentiment of\r\ngratitude or affection. In expressing their opinion of us in after\r\nyears, they said we were a very troublesome, obstinate, disobedient set\r\nof children. I have no doubt we were in constant rebellion against their\r\npetty tyranny. Abraham, Peter, and Jacob viewed us in a different light,\r\nand I have the most pleasant recollections of their kind services.\r\n\r\nIn the winter, outside the house, we had the snow with which to build\r\nstatues and make forts, and huge piles of wood covered with ice, which\r\nwe called the Alps, so difficult were they of ascent and descent. There\r\nwe would climb up and down by the hour, if not interrupted, which,\r\nhowever, was generally the case. It always seemed to me that, in the\r\nheight of our enthusiasm, we were invariably summoned to some\r\ndisagreeable duty, which would appear to show that thus early I keenly\r\nenjoyed outdoor life. Theodore Tilton has thus described the place where\r\nI was born: \"Birthplace is secondary parentage, and transmits character.\r\nJohnstown was more famous half a century ago than since; for then,\r\nthough small, it was a marked intellectual center; and now, though\r\nlarge, it is an unmarked manufacturing town. Before the birth of\r\nElizabeth Cady it was the vice-ducal seat of Sir William Johnson, the\r\nfamous English negotiator with the Indians. During her girlhood it was\r\nan arena for the intellectual wrestlings of Kent, Tompkins, Spencer,\r\nElisha Williams, and Abraham Van Vechten, who, as lawyers, were among\r\nthe chiefest of their time. It is now devoted mainly to the fabrication\r\nof steel springs and buckskin gloves. So, like Wordsworth's early star,\r\nit has faded into the light of common day. But Johnstown retains one of\r\nits ancient splendors--a glory still fresh as at the foundation of the\r\nworld. Standing on its hills, one looks off upon a country of enameled\r\nmeadow lands, that melt away southward toward the Mohawk, and northward\r\nto the base of those grand mountains which are 'God's monument over the\r\ngrave of John Brown.'\"\r\n\r\nHarold Frederic's novel, \"In the Valley,\" contains many descriptions of\r\nthis region that are true to nature, as I remember the Mohawk Valley,\r\nfor I first knew it not so many years after the scenes which he lays\r\nthere. Before I was old enough to take in the glory of this scenery and\r\nits classic associations, Johnstown was to me a gloomy-looking town. The\r\nmiddle of the streets was paved with large cobblestones, over which the\r\nfarmer's wagons rattled from morning till night, while the sidewalks\r\nwere paved with very small cobblestones, over which we carefully picked\r\nour way, so that free and graceful walking was out of the question. The\r\nstreets were lined with solemn poplar trees, from which small yellow\r\nworms were continually dangling down. Next to the Prince of Darkness, I\r\nfeared these worms. They were harmless, but the sight of one made me\r\ntremble. So many people shared in this feeling that the poplars were all\r\ncut down and elms planted in their stead. The Johnstown academy and\r\nchurches were large square buildings, painted white, surrounded by these\r\nsame sombre poplars, each edifice having a doleful bell which seemed to\r\nbe ever tolling for school, funerals, church, or prayer meetings. Next\r\nto the worms, those clanging bells filled me with the utmost dread; they\r\nseemed like so many warnings of an eternal future. Visions of the\r\nInferno were strongly impressed on my childish imagination. It was\r\nthought, in those days, that firm faith in hell and the devil was the\r\ngreatest help to virtue. It certainly made me very unhappy whenever my\r\nmind dwelt on such teachings, and I have always had my doubts of the\r\nvirtue that is based on the fear of punishment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I may be pardoned a word devoted to my appearance in those days.\r\nI have been told that I was a plump little girl, with very fair skin,\r\nrosy cheeks, good features, dark-brown hair, and laughing blue eyes. A\r\nstudent in my father's office, the late Henry Bayard of Delaware (an\r\nuncle of our recent Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, Thomas F.\r\nBayard), told me one day, after conning my features carefully, that I\r\nhad one defect which he could remedy. \"Your eyebrows should be darker\r\nand heavier,\" said he, \"and if you will let me shave them once or twice,\r\nyou will be much improved.\" I consented, and, slight as my eyebrows\r\nwere, they seemed to have had some expression, for the loss of them had\r\na most singular effect on my appearance. Everybody, including even the\r\noperator, laughed at my odd-looking face, and I was in the depths of\r\nhumiliation during the period while my eyebrows were growing out again.\r\nIt is scarcely necessary for me to add that I never allowed the young\r\nman to repeat the experiment, although strongly urged to do so.\r\n\r\nI cannot recall how or when I conquered the alphabet, words in three\r\nletters, the multiplication table, the points of the compass, the\r\nchicken pox, whooping cough, measles, and scarlet fever. All these\r\nunhappy incidents of childhood left but little impression on my mind. I\r\nhave, however, most pleasant memories of the good spinster, Maria Yost,\r\nwho patiently taught three generations of children the rudiments of the\r\nEnglish language, and introduced us to the pictures in \"Murray's\r\nSpelling-book,\" where Old Father Time, with his scythe, and the farmer\r\nstoning the boys in his apple trees, gave rise in my mind to many\r\nserious reflections. Miss Yost was plump and rosy, with fair hair, and\r\nhad a merry twinkle in her blue eyes, and she took us by very easy\r\nstages through the old-fashioned school-books. The interesting Readers\r\nchildren now have were unknown sixty years ago. We did not reach the\r\ntemple of knowledge by the flowery paths of ease in which our\r\ndescendants now walk.\r\n\r\nI still have a perfect vision of myself and sisters, as we stood up in\r\nthe classes, with our toes at the cracks in the floor, all dressed alike\r\nin bright red flannel, black alpaca aprons, and, around the neck, a\r\nstarched ruffle that, through a lack of skill on the part of either the\r\nlaundress or the nurse who sewed them in, proved a constant source of\r\ndiscomfort to us. I have since seen full-grown men, under slighter\r\nprovocation than we endured, jerk off a collar, tear it in two, and\r\nthrow it to the winds, chased by the most soul-harrowing expletives. But\r\nwe were sternly rebuked for complaining, and if we ventured to introduce\r\nour little fingers between the delicate skin and the irritating linen,\r\nour hands were slapped and the ruffle readjusted a degree closer. Our\r\nSunday dresses were relieved with a black sprig and white aprons. We had\r\nred cloaks, red hoods, red mittens, and red stockings. For one's self to\r\nbe all in red six months of the year was bad enough, but to have this\r\ncostume multiplied by three was indeed monotonous. I had such an\r\naversion to that color that I used to rebel regularly at the beginning\r\nof each season when new dresses were purchased, until we finally passed\r\ninto an exquisite shade of blue. No words could do justice to my dislike\r\nof those red dresses. My grandfather's detestation of the British\r\nredcoats must have descended to me. My childhood's antipathy to wearing\r\nred enabled me later to comprehend the feelings of a little niece, who\r\nhated everything pea green, because she had once heard the saying, \"neat\r\nbut not gaudy, as the devil said when he painted his tail pea green.\" So\r\nwhen a friend brought her a cravat of that color she threw it on the\r\nfloor and burst into tears, saying, \"I could not wear that, for it is\r\nthe color of the devil's tail.\" I sympathized with the child and had it\r\nchanged for the hue she liked. Although we cannot always understand the\r\nground for children's preferences, it is often well to heed them.\r\n\r\nI am told that I was pensively looking out of the nursery window one\r\nday, when Mary Dunn, the Scotch nurse, who was something of a\r\nphilosopher, and a stern Presbyterian, said: \"Child, what are you\r\nthinking about; are you planning some new form of mischief?\" \"No, Mary,\"\r\nI replied, \"I was wondering why it was that everything we like to do is\r\na sin, and that everything we dislike is commanded by God or someone on\r\nearth. I am so tired of that everlasting no! no! no! At school, at home,\r\neverywhere it is _no_! Even at church all the commandments begin 'Thou\r\nshalt not.' I suppose God will say 'no' to all we like in the next\r\nworld, just as you do here.\" Mary was dreadfully shocked at my\r\ndissatisfaction with the things of time and prospective eternity, and\r\nexhorted me to cultivate the virtues of obedience and humility.\r\n\r\nI well remember the despair I felt in those years, as I took in the\r\nwhole situation, over the constant cribbing and crippling of a child's\r\nlife. I suppose I found fit language in which to express my thoughts,\r\nfor Mary Dunn told me, years after, how our discussion roused my sister\r\nMargaret, who was an attentive listener. I must have set forth our\r\nwrongs in clear, unmistakable terms; for Margaret exclaimed one day, \"I\r\ntell you what to do. Hereafter let us act as we choose, without asking.\"\r\n\"Then,\" said I, \"we shall be punished.\" \"Suppose we are,\" said she, \"we\r\nshall have had our fun at any rate, and that is better than to mind the\r\neverlasting 'no' and not have any fun at all.\" Her logic seemed\r\nunanswerable, so together we gradually acted on her suggestions. Having\r\nless imagination than I, she took a common-sense view of life and\r\nsuffered nothing from anticipation of troubles, while my sorrows were\r\nintensified fourfold by innumerable apprehensions of possible\r\nexigencies.\r\n\r\nOur nursery, a large room over a back building, had three barred windows\r\nreaching nearly to the floor. Two of these opened on a gently slanting\r\nroof over a veranda. In our night robes, on warm summer evenings we\r\ncould, by dint of skillful twisting and compressing, get out between the\r\nbars, and there, snugly braced against the house, we would sit and enjoy\r\nthe moon and stars and what sounds might reach us from the streets,\r\nwhile the nurse, gossiping at the back door, imagined we were safely\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nI have a confused memory of being often under punishment for what, in\r\nthose days, were called \"tantrums.\" I suppose they were really\r\njustifiable acts of rebellion against the tyranny of those in authority.\r\nI have often listened since, with real satisfaction, to what some of our\r\nfriends had to say of the high-handed manner in which sister Margaret\r\nand I defied all the transient orders and strict rules laid down for our\r\nguidance. If we had observed them we might as well have been embalmed as\r\nmummies, for all the pleasure and freedom we should have had in our\r\nchildhood. As very little was then done for the amusement of children,\r\nhappy were those who _conscientiously_ took the liberty of amusing\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOne charming feature of our village was a stream of water, called the\r\nCayadutta, which ran through the north end, in which it was our delight\r\nto walk on the broad slate stones when the water was low, in order to\r\npick up pretty pebbles. These joys were also forbidden, though indulged\r\nin as opportunity afforded, especially as sister Margaret's philosophy\r\nwas found to work successfully and we had finally risen above our\r\ninfantile fear of punishment.\r\n\r\nMuch of my freedom at this time was due to this sister, who afterward\r\nbecame the wife of Colonel Duncan McMartin of Iowa. I can see her now,\r\nhat in hand, her long curls flying in the wind, her nose slightly\r\nretroussé, her large dark eyes flashing with glee, and her small\r\nstraight mouth so expressive of determination. Though two years my\r\njunior, she was larger and stronger than I and more fearless and\r\nself-reliant. She was always ready to start when any pleasure offered,\r\nand, if I hesitated, she would give me a jerk and say, emphatically:\r\n\"Oh, come along!\" and away we went.\r\n\r\nAbout this time we entered the Johnstown Academy, where we made the\r\nacquaintance of the daughters of the hotel keeper and the county\r\nsheriff. They were a few years my senior, but, as I was ahead of them in\r\nall my studies, the difference of age was somewhat equalized and we\r\nbecame fast friends. This acquaintance opened to us two new sources of\r\nenjoyment--the freedom of the hotel during \"court week\" (a great event\r\nin village life) and the exploration of the county jail. Our Scotch\r\nnurse had told us so many thrilling tales of castles, prisons, and\r\ndungeons in the Old World that, to see the great keys and iron doors,\r\nthe handcuffs and chains, and the prisoners in their cells seemed like a\r\nveritable visit to Mary's native land. We made frequent visits to the\r\njail and became deeply concerned about the fate of the prisoners, who\r\nwere greatly pleased with our expressions of sympathy and our gifts of\r\ncake and candy. In time we became interested in the trials and sentences\r\nof prisoners, and would go to the courthouse and listen to the\r\nproceedings. Sometimes we would slip into the hotel where the judges and\r\nlawyers dined, and help our little friend wait on table. The rushing of\r\nservants to and fro, the calling of guests, the scolding of servants in\r\nthe kitchen, the banging of doors, the general hubbub, the noise and\r\nclatter, were all idealized by me into one of those royal festivals Mary\r\nso often described. To be allowed to carry plates of bread and butter,\r\npie and cheese I counted a high privilege. But more especially I enjoyed\r\nlistening to the conversations in regard to the probable fate of our\r\nfriends the prisoners in the jail. On one occasion I projected a few\r\nremarks into a conversation between two lawyers, when one of them turned\r\nabruptly to me and said, \"Child, you'd better attend to your business;\r\nbring me a glass of water.\" I replied indignantly, \"I am not a servant;\r\nI am here for fun.\"\r\n\r\nIn all these escapades we were followed by Peter, black as coal and six\r\nfeet in height. It seems to me now that his chief business was to\r\ndiscover our whereabouts, get us home to dinner, and take us back to\r\nschool. Fortunately he was overflowing with curiosity and not averse to\r\nlingering a while where anything of interest was to be seen or heard,\r\nand, as we were deemed perfectly safe under his care, no questions were\r\nasked when we got to the house, if we had been with him. He had a long\r\nhead and, through his diplomacy, we escaped much disagreeable\r\nsurveillance. Peter was very fond of attending court. All the lawyers\r\nknew him, and wherever Peter went, the three little girls in his charge\r\nwent, too. Thus, with constant visits to the jail, courthouse, and my\r\nfather's office, I gleaned some idea of the danger of violating the law.\r\n\r\nThe great events of the year were the Christmas holidays, the Fourth of\r\nJuly, and \"general training,\" as the review of the county militia was\r\nthen called. The winter gala days are associated, in my memory, with\r\nhanging up stockings and with turkeys, mince pies, sweet cider, and\r\nsleighrides by moonlight. My earliest recollections of those happy days,\r\nwhen schools were closed, books laid aside, and unusual liberties\r\nallowed, center in that large cellar kitchen to which I have already\r\nreferred. There we spent many winter evenings in uninterrupted\r\nenjoyment. A large fireplace with huge logs shed warmth and cheerfulness\r\naround. In one corner sat Peter sawing his violin, while our youthful\r\nneighbors danced with us and played blindman's buff almost every evening\r\nduring the vacation. The most interesting character in this game was a\r\nblack boy called Jacob (Peter's lieutenant), who made things lively for\r\nus by always keeping one eye open--a wise precaution to guard himself\r\nfrom danger, and to keep us on the jump. Hickory nuts, sweet cider, and\r\n_olie-koeks_ (a Dutch name for a fried cake with raisins inside) were\r\nour refreshments when there came a lull in the fun.\r\n\r\nAs St. Nicholas was supposed to come down the chimney, our stockings\r\nwere pinned on a broomstick, laid across two chairs in front of the\r\nfireplace. We retired on Christmas Eve with the most pleasing\r\nanticipations of what would be in our stockings next morning. The\r\nthermometer in that latitude was often twenty degrees below zero, yet,\r\nbright and early, we would run downstairs in our bare feet over the cold\r\nfloors to carry stockings, broom, etc., to the nursery. The gorgeous\r\npresents that St. Nicholas now distributes show that he, too, has been\r\ngrowing up with the country. The boys and girls of 1897 will laugh when\r\nthey hear of the contents of our stockings in 1823. There was a little\r\npaper of candy, one of raisins, another, of nuts, a red apple, an\r\n_olie-koek_, and a bright silver quarter of a dollar in the toe. If a\r\nchild had been guilty of any erratic performances during the year, which\r\nwas often my case, a long stick would protrude from the stocking; if\r\nparticularly good, an illustrated catechism or the New Testament would\r\nappear, showing that the St. Nicholas of that time held decided views\r\non discipline and ethics.\r\n\r\nDuring the day we would take a drive over the snow-clad hills and\r\nvalleys in a long red lumber sleigh. All the children it could hold made\r\nthe forests echo with their songs and laughter. The sleigh bells and\r\nPeter's fine tenor voice added to the chorus seemed to chant, as we\r\npassed, \"Merry Christmas\" to the farmers' children and to all we met on\r\nthe highway.\r\n\r\nReturning home, we were allowed, as a great Christmas treat, to watch\r\nall Peter's preparations for dinner. Attired in a white apron and\r\nturban, holding in his hand a tin candlestick the size of a dinner\r\nplate, containing a tallow candle, with stately step he marched into the\r\nspacious cellar, with Jacob and three little girls dressed in red\r\nflannel at his heels. As the farmers paid the interest on their\r\nmortgages in barrels of pork, headcheese, poultry, eggs, and cider, the\r\ncellars were well crowded for the winter, making the master of an\r\nestablishment quite indifferent to all questions of finance. We heard\r\nnothing in those days of greenbacks, silver coinage, or a gold basis.\r\nLaden with vegetables, butter, eggs, and a magnificent turkey, Peter and\r\nhis followers returned to the kitchen. There, seated on a big ironing\r\ntable, we watched the dressing and roasting of the bird in a tin oven in\r\nfront of the fire. Jacob peeled the vegetables, we all sang, and Peter\r\ntold us marvelous stories. For tea he made flapjacks, baked in a pan\r\nwith a long handle, which he turned by throwing the cake up and\r\nskillfully catching it descending.\r\n\r\nPeter was a devout Episcopalian and took great pleasure in helping the\r\nyoung people decorate the church. He would take us with him and show us\r\nhow to make evergreen wreaths. Like Mary's lamb, where'er he went we\r\nwere sure to go. His love for us was unbounded and fully returned. He\r\nwas the only being, visible or invisible, of whom we had no fear. We\r\nwould go to divine service with Peter, Christmas morning and sit with\r\nhim by the door, in what was called \"the negro pew.\" He was the only\r\ncolored member of the church and, after all the other communicants had\r\ntaken the sacrament, he went alone to the altar. Dressed in a new suit\r\nof blue with gilt buttons, he looked like a prince, as, with head erect,\r\nhe walked up the aisle, the grandest specimen of manhood in the whole\r\ncongregation; and yet so strong was prejudice against color in 1823 that\r\nno one would kneel beside him. On leaving us, on one of these occasions,\r\nPeter told us all to sit still until he returned; but, no sooner had he\r\nstarted, than the youngest of us slowly followed after him and seated\r\nherself close beside him. As he came back, holding the child by the\r\nhand, what a lesson it must have been to that prejudiced congregation!\r\nThe first time we entered the church together the sexton opened a white\r\nman's pew for us, telling Peter to leave the Judge's children there.\r\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"they will not stay there without me.\" But, as he could\r\nnot enter, we instinctively followed him to the negro pew.\r\n\r\nOur next great fête was on the anniversary of the birthday of our\r\nRepublic. The festivities were numerous and protracted, beginning then,\r\nas now, at midnight with bonfires and cannon; while the day was ushered\r\nin with the ringing of bells, tremendous cannonading, and a continuous\r\npopping of fire-crackers and torpedoes. Then a procession of soldiers\r\nand citizens marched through the town, an oration was delivered, the\r\nDeclaration of Independence read, and a great dinner given in the open\r\nair under the trees in the grounds of the old courthouse. Each toast was\r\nannounced with the booming of cannon. On these occasions Peter was in\r\nhis element, and showed us whatever he considered worth seeing; but I\r\ncannot say that I enjoyed very much either \"general training\" or the\r\nFourth of July, for, in addition to my fear of cannon and torpedoes, my\r\nsympathies were deeply touched by the sadness of our cook, whose drunken\r\nfather always cut antics in the streets on gala days, the central figure\r\nin all the sports of the boys, much to the mortification of his worthy\r\ndaughter. She wept bitterly over her father's public exhibition of\r\nhimself, and told me in what a condition he would come home to his\r\nfamily at night. I would gladly have stayed in with her all day, but the\r\nfear of being called a coward compelled me to go through those trying\r\nordeals. As my nerves were all on the surface, no words can describe\r\nwhat I suffered with those explosions, great and small, and my fears\r\nlest King George and his minions should reappear among us. I thought\r\nthat, if he had done all the dreadful things stated in the Declaration\r\nof '76, he might come again, burn our houses, and drive us all into the\r\nstreet. Sir William Johnson's mansion of solid masonry, gloomy and\r\nthreatening, still stood in our neighborhood. I had seen the marks of\r\nthe Indian's tomahawk on the balustrades and heard of the bloody deeds\r\nthere enacted. For all the calamities of the nation I believed King\r\nGeorge responsible. At home and at school we were educated to hate the\r\nEnglish. When we remember that, every Fourth of July, the Declaration\r\nwas read with emphasis, and the orator of the day rounded all his\r\nglowing periods with denunciations of the mother country, we need not\r\nwonder at the national hatred of everything English. Our patriotism in\r\nthose early days was measured by our dislike of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn September occurred the great event, the review of the county militia,\r\npopularly called \"Training Day.\" Then everybody went to the race course\r\nto see the troops and buy what the farmers had brought in their wagons.\r\nThere was a peculiar kind of gingerbread and molasses candy to which we\r\nwere treated on those occasions, associated in my mind to this day with\r\nmilitary reviews and standing armies.\r\n\r\nOther pleasures were, roaming in the forests and sailing on the mill\r\npond. One day, when there were no boys at hand and several girls were\r\nimpatiently waiting for a sail on a raft, my sister and I volunteered to\r\nman the expedition. We always acted on the assumption that what we had\r\nseen done, we could do. Accordingly we all jumped on the raft, loosened\r\nit from its moorings, and away we went with the current. Navigation on\r\nthat mill pond was performed with long poles, but, unfortunately, we\r\ncould not lift the poles, and we soon saw we were drifting toward the\r\ndam. But we had the presence of mind to sit down and hold fast to the\r\nraft. Fortunately, we went over right side up and gracefully glided down\r\nthe stream, until rescued by the ever watchful Peter. I did not hear the\r\nlast of that voyage for a long time. I was called the captain of the\r\nexpedition, and one of the boys wrote a composition, which he read in\r\nschool, describing the adventure and emphasizing the ignorance of the\r\nlaws of navigation shown by the officers in command. I shed tears many\r\ntimes over that performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSCHOOL DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was eleven years old, two events occurred which changed\r\nconsiderably the current of my life. My only brother, who had just\r\ngraduated from Union College, came home to die. A young man of great\r\ntalent and promise, he was the pride of my father's heart. We early felt\r\nthat this son filled a larger place in our father's affections and\r\nfuture plans than the five daughters together. Well do I remember how\r\ntenderly he watched my brother in his last illness, the sighs and tears\r\nhe gave vent to as he slowly walked up and down the hall, and, when the\r\nlast sad moment came, and we were all assembled to say farewell in the\r\nsilent chamber of death, how broken were his utterances as he knelt and\r\nprayed for comfort and support. I still recall, too, going into the\r\nlarge darkened parlor to see my brother, and finding the casket,\r\nmirrors, and pictures all draped in white, and my father seated by his\r\nside, pale and immovable. As he took no notice of me, after standing a\r\nlong while, I climbed upon his knee, when he mechanically put his arm\r\nabout me and, with my head resting against his beating heart, we both\r\nsat in silence, he thinking of the wreck of all his hopes in the loss of\r\na dear son, and I wondering what could be said or done to fill the void\r\nin his breast. At length he heaved a deep sigh and said: \"Oh, my\r\ndaughter, I wish you were a boy!\" Throwing my arms about his neck, I\r\nreplied: \"I will try to be all my brother was.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARGARET LIVINGSTON CADY.] [Illustration: JUDGE DANIEL\r\nCADY.] Then and there I resolved that I would not give so much time as\r\nheretofore to play, but would study and strive to be at the head of all\r\nmy classes and thus delight my father's heart. All that day and far into\r\nthe night I pondered the problem of boyhood. I thought that the chief\r\nthing to be done in order to equal boys was to be learned and\r\ncourageous. So I decided to study Greek and learn to manage a horse.\r\nHaving formed this conclusion I fell asleep. My resolutions, unlike many\r\nsuch made at night, did not vanish with the coming light. I arose early\r\nand hastened to put them into execution. They were resolutions never to\r\nbe forgotten--destined to mold my character anew. As soon as I was\r\ndressed I hastened to our good pastor, Rev. Simon Hosack, who was always\r\nearly at work in his garden.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" said I, \"which do you like best, boys or girls?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, girls, to be sure; I would not give you for all the boys in\r\nChristendom.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father,\" I replied, \"prefers boys; he wishes I was one, and I intend\r\nto be as near like one as possible. I am going to ride on horseback and\r\nstudy Greek. Will you give me a Greek lesson now, doctor? I want to\r\nbegin at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, child,\" said he, throwing down his hoe, \"come into my library and\r\nwe will begin without delay.\"\r\n\r\nHe entered fully into the feeling of suffering and sorrow which took\r\npossession of me when I discovered that a girl weighed less in the scale\r\nof being than a boy, and he praised my determination to prove the\r\ncontrary. The old grammar which he had studied in the University of\r\nGlasgow was soon in my hands, and the Greek article was learned before\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nThen came the sad pageantry of death, the weeping of friends, the dark\r\nrooms, the ghostly stillness, the exhortation to the living to prepare\r\nfor death, the solemn prayer, the mournful chant, the funeral cortège,\r\nthe solemn, tolling bell, the burial. How I suffered during those sad\r\ndays! What strange undefined fears of the unknown took possession of me!\r\nFor months afterward, at the twilight hour, I went with my father to the\r\nnew-made grave. Near it stood two tall poplar trees, against one of\r\nwhich I leaned, while my father threw himself on the grave, with\r\noutstretched arms, as if to embrace his child. At last the frosts and\r\nstorms of November came and threw a chilling barrier between the living\r\nand the dead, and we went there no more.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time I kept up my lessons at the parsonage and made\r\nrapid progress. I surprised even my teacher, who thought me capable of\r\ndoing anything. I learned to drive, and to leap a fence and ditch on\r\nhorseback. I taxed every power, hoping some day to hear my father say:\r\n\"Well, a girl is as good as a boy, after all.\" But he never said it.\r\nWhen the doctor came over to spend the evening with us, I would whisper\r\nin his ear: \"Tell my father how fast I get on,\" and he would tell him,\r\nand was lavish in his praises. But my father only paced the room,\r\nsighed, and showed that he wished I were a boy; and I, not knowing why\r\nhe felt thus, would hide my tears of vexation on the doctor's shoulder.\r\n\r\nSoon after this I began to study Latin, Greek, and mathematics with a\r\nclass of boys in the Academy, many of whom were much older than I. For\r\nthree years one boy kept his place at the head of the class, and I\r\nalways stood next. Two prizes were offered in Greek. I strove for one\r\nand took the second. How well I remember my joy in receiving that prize.\r\nThere was no sentiment of ambition, rivalry, or triumph over my\r\ncompanions, nor feeling of satisfaction in receiving this honor in the\r\npresence of those assembled on the day of the exhibition. One thought\r\nalone filled my mind. \"Now,\" said I, \"my father will be satisfied with\r\nme.\" So, as soon as we were dismissed, I ran down the hill, rushed\r\nbreathless into his office, laid the new Greek Testament, which was my\r\nprize, on his table and exclaimed: \"There, I got it!\" He took up the\r\nbook, asked me some questions about the class, the teachers, the\r\nspectators, and, evidently pleased, handed it back to me. Then, while I\r\nstood looking and waiting for him to say something which would show that\r\nhe recognized the equality of the daughter with the son, he kissed me on\r\nthe forehead and exclaimed, with a sigh, \"Ah, you should have been a\r\nboy!\"\r\n\r\nMy joy was turned to sadness. I ran to my good doctor. He chased my\r\nbitter tears away, and soothed me with unbounded praises and visions of\r\nfuture success. He was then confined to the house with his last illness.\r\nHe asked me that day if I would like to have, when he was gone, the old\r\nlexicon, Testament, and grammar that we had so often thumbed together.\r\n\"Yes, but I would rather have you stay,\" I replied, \"for what can I do\r\nwhen you are gone?\" \"Oh,\" said he tenderly, \"I shall not be gone; my\r\nspirit will still be with you, watching you in all life's struggles.\"\r\nNoble, generous friend! He had but little on earth to bequeath to\r\nanyone, but when the last scene in his life was ended, and his will was\r\nopened, sure enough there was a clause saying: \"My Greek lexicon,\r\nTestament, and grammar, and four volumes of Scott's commentaries, I will\r\nto Elizabeth Cady.\" I never look at these books without a feeling of\r\nthankfulness that in childhood I was blessed with such a friend and\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nI can truly say, after an experience of seventy years, that all the\r\ncares and anxieties, the trials and disappointments of my whole life,\r\nare light, when balanced with my sufferings in childhood and youth from\r\nthe theological dogmas which I sincerely believed, and the gloom\r\nconnected with everything associated with the name of religion, the\r\nchurch, the parsonage, the graveyard, and the solemn, tolling bell.\r\nEverything connected with death was then rendered inexpressibly\r\ndolorous. The body, covered with a black pall, was borne on the\r\nshoulders of men; the mourners were in crape and walked with bowed\r\nheads, while the neighbors who had tears to shed, did so copiously and\r\nsummoned up their saddest facial expressions. At the grave came the\r\nsober warnings to the living and sometimes frightful prophesies as to\r\nthe state of the dead. All this pageantry of woe and visions of the\r\nunknown land beyond the tomb, often haunted my midnight dreams and\r\nshadowed the sunshine of my days. The parsonage, with its bare walls and\r\nfloors, its shriveled mistress and her blind sister, more like ghostly\r\nshadows than human flesh and blood; the two black servants, racked with\r\nrheumatism and odoriferous with a pungent oil they used in the vain hope\r\nof making their weary limbs more supple; the aged parson buried in his\r\nlibrary in the midst of musty books and papers--all this only added to\r\nthe gloom of my surroundings. The church, which was bare, with no\r\nfurnace to warm us, no organ to gladden our hearts, no choir to lead our\r\nsongs of praise in harmony, was sadly lacking in all attractions for the\r\nyouthful mind. The preacher, shut up in an octagonal box high above our\r\nheads, gave us sermons over an hour long, and the chorister, in a\r\nsimilar box below him, intoned line after line of David's Psalms, while,\r\nlike a flock of sheep at the heels of their shepherd, the congregation,\r\nwithout regard to time or tune, straggled after their leader.\r\n\r\nYears later, the introduction of stoves, a violoncello, Wesley's hymns,\r\nand a choir split the church in twain. These old Scotch Presbyterians\r\nwere opposed to all innovations that would afford their people paths of\r\nflowery ease on the road to Heaven. So, when the thermometer was twenty\r\ndegrees below zero on the Johnstown Hills, four hundred feet above the\r\nMohawk Valley, we trudged along through the snow, foot-stoves in hand,\r\nto the cold hospitalities of the \"Lord's House,\" there to be chilled to\r\nthe very core by listening to sermons on \"predestination,\"\r\n\"justification by faith,\" and \"eternal damnation.\"\r\n\r\nTo be restless, or to fall asleep under such solemn circumstances was a\r\nsure evidence of total depravity, and of the machinations of the devil\r\nstriving to turn one's heart from God and his ordinances. As I was\r\nguilty of these shortcomings and many more, I early believed myself a\r\nveritable child of the Evil One, and suffered endless fears lest he\r\nshould come some night and claim me as his own. To me he was a personal,\r\never-present reality, crouching in a dark corner of the nursery. Ah! how\r\nmany times I have stolen out of bed, and sat shivering on the stairs,\r\nwhere the hall lamp and the sound of voices from the parlor would, in a\r\nmeasure, mitigate my terror. Thanks to a vigorous constitution and\r\noverflowing animal spirits, I was able to endure for years the strain of\r\nthese depressing influences, until my reasoning powers and common sense\r\ntriumphed at last over my imagination. The memory of my own suffering\r\nhas prevented me from ever shadowing one young soul with any of the\r\nsuperstitions of the Christian religion. But there have been many\r\nchanges, even in my native town, since those dark days. Our old church\r\nwas turned into a mitten factory, and the pleasant hum of machinery and\r\nthe glad faces of men and women have chased the evil spirits to their\r\nhiding places. One finds at Johnstown now, beautiful churches,\r\nornamented cemeteries, and cheerful men and women, quite emancipated\r\nfrom the nonsense and terrors of the old theologies.\r\n\r\nAn important event in our family circle was the marriage of my oldest\r\nsister, Tryphena, to Edward Bayard of Wilmington, Delaware. He was a\r\ngraduate of Union College, a classmate of my brother, and frequently\r\nvisited at my father's house. At the end of his college course, he came\r\nwith his brother Henry to study law in Johnstown. A quiet, retired\r\nlittle village was thought to be a good place in which to sequester\r\nyoung men bent on completing their education, as they were there safe\r\nfrom the temptations and distracting influences of large cities. In\r\naddition to this consideration, my father's reputation made his office a\r\ndesirable resort for students, who, furthermore, not only improved their\r\nopportunities by reading Blackstone, Kent, and Story, but also by making\r\nlove to the Judge's daughters. We thus had the advantage of many\r\npleasant acquaintances from the leading families in the country, and, in\r\nthis way, it was that four of the sisters eventually selected most\r\nworthy husbands.\r\n\r\nThough only twenty-one years of age when married, Edward Bayard was a\r\ntall, fully developed man, remarkably fine looking, with cultivated\r\nliterary taste and a profound knowledge of human nature. Warm and\r\naffectionate, generous to a fault in giving and serving, he was soon a\r\ngreat favorite in the family, and gradually filled the void made in all\r\nour hearts by the loss of the brother and son.\r\n\r\nMy father was so fully occupied with the duties of his profession, which\r\noften called him from home, and my mother so weary with the cares of a\r\nlarge family, having had ten children, though only five survived at this\r\ntime, that they were quite willing to shift their burdens to younger\r\nshoulders. Our eldest sister and her husband, therefore, soon became our\r\ncounselors and advisers. They selected our clothing, books, schools,\r\nacquaintances, and directed our reading and amusements. Thus the reins\r\nof domestic government, little by little, passed into their hands, and\r\nthe family arrangements were in a manner greatly improved in favor of\r\ngreater liberty for the children.\r\n\r\nThe advent of Edward and Henry Bayard was an inestimable blessing to us.\r\nWith them came an era of picnics, birthday parties, and endless\r\namusements; the buying of pictures, fairy books, musical instruments and\r\nponies, and frequent excursions with parties on horseback. Fresh from\r\ncollege, they made our lessons in Latin, Greek, and mathematics so easy\r\nthat we studied with real pleasure and had more leisure for play. Henry\r\nBayard's chief pleasures were walking, riding, and playing all manner of\r\ngames, from jack-straws to chess, with the three younger sisters, and we\r\nhave often said that the three years he passed in Johnstown were the\r\nmost delightful of our girlhood.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the death of my brother, a journey was planned to\r\nvisit our grandmother Cady, who lived in Canaan, Columbia County, about\r\ntwenty miles from Albany. My two younger sisters and myself had never\r\nbeen outside of our own county before, and the very thought of a journey\r\nroused our enthusiasm to the highest pitch. On a bright day in September\r\nwe started, packed in two carriages. We were wild with delight as we\r\ndrove down the Mohawk Valley, with its beautiful river and its many\r\nbridges and ferryboats. When we reached Schenectady, the first city we\r\nhad ever seen, we stopped to dine at the old Given's Hotel, where we\r\nbroke loose from all the moorings of propriety on beholding the paper on\r\nthe dining-room wall, illustrating in brilliant colors the great events\r\nin sacred history. There were the Patriarchs, with flowing beards and in\r\ngorgeous attire; Abraham, offering up Isaac; Joseph, with his coat of\r\nmany colors, thrown into a pit by his brethren; Noah's ark on an ocean\r\nof waters; Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea; Rebecca at the well, and\r\nMoses in the bulrushes. All these distinguished personages were familiar\r\nto us, and to see them here for the first time in living colors, made\r\nsilence and eating impossible. We dashed around the room, calling to\r\neach other: \"Oh, Kate, look here!\" \"Oh, Madge, look there!\" \"See little\r\nMoses!\" \"See the angels on Jacob's ladder!\" Our exclamations could not\r\nbe kept within bounds. The guests were amused beyond description, while\r\nmy mother and elder sisters were equally mortified; but Mr. Bayard, who\r\nappreciated our childish surprise and delight, smiled and said: \"I'll\r\ntake them around and show them the pictures, and then they will be able\r\nto dine,\" which we finally did.\r\n\r\nOn our way to Albany we were forced to listen to no end of dissertations\r\non manners, and severe criticisms on our behavior at the hotel, but we\r\nwere too happy and astonished with all we saw to take a subjective view\r\nof ourselves. Even Peter in his new livery, who had not seen much more\r\nthan we had, while looking out of the corners of his eyes, maintained a\r\nquiet dignity and conjured us \"not to act as if we had just come out of\r\nthe woods and had never seen anything before.\" However, there are\r\nconditions in the child soul in which repression is impossible, when the\r\nmind takes in nothing but its own enjoyment, and when even the sense of\r\nhearing is lost in that of sight. The whole party awoke to that fact at\r\nlast. Children are not actors. We never had experienced anything like\r\nthis journey, and how could we help being surprised and delighted?\r\n\r\nWhen we drove into Albany, the first large city we had ever visited, we\r\nexclaimed, \"Why, it's general training, here!\" We had acquired our ideas\r\nof crowds from our country militia reviews. Fortunately, there was no\r\npictorial wall paper in the old City Hotel. But the decree had gone\r\nforth that, on the remainder of the journey, our meals would be served\r\nin a private room, with Peter to wait on us. This seemed like going back\r\nto the nursery days and was very humiliating. But eating, even there,\r\nwas difficult, as we could hear the band from the old museum, and, as\r\nour windows opened on the street, the continual panorama of people and\r\ncarriages passing by was quite as enticing as the Bible scenes in\r\nSchenectady. In the evening we walked around to see the city lighted, to\r\nlook into the shop windows, and to visit the museum. The next morning we\r\nstarted for Canaan, our enthusiasm still unabated, though strong hopes\r\nwere expressed that we would be toned down with the fatigues of the\r\nfirst day's journey.\r\n\r\nThe large farm with its cattle, sheep, hens, ducks, turkeys, and geese;\r\nits creamery, looms, and spinning wheel; its fruits and vegetables; the\r\ndrives among the grand old hills; the blessed old grandmother, and the\r\nmany aunts, uncles, and cousins to kiss, all this kept us still in a\r\nwhirlpool of excitement. Our joy bubbled over of itself; it was beyond\r\nour control. After spending a delightful week at Canaan, we departed,\r\nwith an addition to our party, much to Peter's disgust, of a bright,\r\ncoal-black boy of fifteen summers. Peter kept grumbling that he had\r\nchildren enough to look after already, but, as the boy was handsome and\r\nintelligent, could read, write, play on the jewsharp and banjo, sing,\r\ndance, and stand on his head, we were charmed with this new-found\r\ntreasure, who proved later to be a great family blessing. We were less\r\nvivacious on the return trip. Whether this was due to Peter's untiring\r\nefforts to keep us within bounds, or whether the novelty of the journey\r\nwas in a measure gone, it is difficult to determine, but we evidently\r\nwere not so buoyant and were duly complimented on our good behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached home and told our village companions what we had seen in\r\nour extensive travels (just seventy miles from home) they were filled\r\nwith wonder, and we became heroines in their estimation. After this we\r\ntook frequent journeys to Saratoga, the Northern Lakes, Utica, and\r\nPeterboro, but were never again so entirely swept from our feet as with\r\nthe biblical illustrations in the dining room of the old Given's Hotel.\r\n\r\nAs my father's office joined the house, I spent there much of my time,\r\nwhen out of school, listening to the clients stating their cases,\r\ntalking with the students, and reading the laws in regard to woman. In\r\nour Scotch neighborhood many men still retained the old feudal ideas of\r\nwomen and property. Fathers, at their death, would will the bulk of\r\ntheir property to the eldest son, with the proviso that the mother was\r\nto have a home with him. Hence it was not unusual for the mother, who\r\nhad brought all the property into the family, to be made an unhappy\r\ndependent on the bounty of an uncongenial daughter-in-law and a\r\ndissipated son. The tears and complaints of the women who came to my\r\nfather for legal advice touched my heart and early drew my attention to\r\nthe injustice and cruelty of the laws. As the practice of the law was my\r\nfather's business, I could not exactly understand why he could not\r\nalleviate the sufferings of these women. So, in order to enlighten me,\r\nhe would take down his books and show me the inexorable statutes. The\r\nstudents, observing my interest, would amuse themselves by reading to me\r\nall the worst laws they could find, over which I would laugh and cry by\r\nturns. One Christmas morning I went into the office to show them, among\r\nother of my presents, a new coral necklace and bracelets. They all\r\nadmired the jewelry and then began to tease me with hypothetical cases\r\nof future ownership. \"Now,\" said Henry Bayard, \"if in due time you\r\nshould be my wife, those ornaments would be mine; I could take them and\r\nlock them up, and you could never wear them except with my permission. I\r\ncould even exchange them for a box of cigars, and you could watch them\r\nevaporate in smoke.\"\r\n\r\nWith this constant bantering from students and the sad complaints of the\r\nwomen, my mind was sorely perplexed. So when, from time to time, my\r\nattention was called to these odious laws, I would mark them with a\r\npencil, and becoming more and more convinced of the necessity of taking\r\nsome active measures against these unjust provisions, I resolved to\r\nseize the first opportunity, when alone in the office, to cut every one\r\nof them out of the books; supposing my father and his library were the\r\nbeginning and the end of the law. However, this mutilation of his\r\nvolumes was never accomplished, for dear old Flora Campbell, to whom I\r\nconfided my plan for the amelioration of the wrongs of my unhappy sex,\r\nwarned my father of what I proposed to do. Without letting me know that\r\nhe had discovered my secret, he explained to me one evening how laws\r\nwere made, the large number of lawyers and libraries there were all over\r\nthe State, and that if his library should burn up it would make no\r\ndifference in woman's condition. \"When you are grown up, and able to\r\nprepare a speech,\" said he, \"you must go down to Albany and talk to the\r\nlegislators; tell them all you have seen in this office--the sufferings\r\nof these Scotchwomen, robbed of their inheritance and left dependent on\r\ntheir unworthy sons, and, if you can persuade them to pass new laws, the\r\nold ones will be a dead letter.\" Thus was the future object of my life\r\nforeshadowed and my duty plainly outlined by him who was most opposed\r\nto my public career when, in due time, I entered upon it.\r\n\r\nUntil I was sixteen years old, I was a faithful student in the Johnstown\r\nAcademy with a class of boys. Though I was the only girl in the higher\r\nclasses of mathematics and the languages, yet, in our plays, all the\r\ngirls and boys mingled freely together. In running races, sliding\r\ndownhill, and snowballing, we made no distinction of sex. True, the boys\r\nwould carry the school books and pull the sleighs up hill for their\r\nfavorite girls, but equality was the general basis of our school\r\nrelations. I dare say the boys did not make their snowballs quite so\r\nhard when pelting the girls, nor wash their faces with the same\r\nvehemence as they did each other's, but there was no public evidence of\r\npartiality. However, if any boy was too rough or took advantage of a\r\ngirl smaller than himself, he was promptly thrashed by his fellows.\r\nThere was an unwritten law and public sentiment in that little Academy\r\nworld that enabled us to study and play together with the greatest\r\nfreedom and harmony.\r\n\r\nFrom the academy the boys of my class went to Union College at\r\nSchenectady. When those with whom I had studied and contended for prizes\r\nfor five years came to bid me good-by, and I learned of the barrier that\r\nprevented me from following in their footsteps--\"no girls admitted\r\nhere\"--my vexation and mortification knew no bounds. I remember, now,\r\nhow proud and handsome the boys looked in their new clothes, as they\r\njumped into the old stage coach and drove off, and how lonely I felt\r\nwhen they were gone and I had nothing to do, for the plans for my future\r\nwere yet undetermined. Again I felt more keenly than ever the\r\nhumiliation of the distinctions made on the ground of sex.\r\n\r\nMy time was now occupied with riding on horseback, studying the game of\r\nchess, and continually squabbling with the law students over the rights\r\nof women. Something was always coming up in the experiences of everyday\r\nlife, or in the books we were reading, to give us fresh topics for\r\nargument. They would read passages from the British classics quite as\r\naggravating as the laws. They delighted in extracts from Shakespeare,\r\nespecially from \"The Taming of the Shrew,\" an admirable satire in itself\r\non the old common law of England. I hated Petruchio as if he were a real\r\nman. Young Bayard would recite with unction the famous reply of Milton's\r\nideal woman to Adam: \"God thy law, thou mine.\" The Bible, too, was\r\nbrought into requisition. In fact it seemed to me that every book taught\r\nthe \"divinely ordained\" headship of man; but my mind never yielded to\r\nthis popular heresy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nGIRLHOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Willard's Seminary at Troy was the fashionable school in my\r\ngirlhood, and in the winter of 1830, with upward of a hundred other\r\ngirls, I found myself an active participant in all the joys and sorrows\r\nof that institution. When in family council it was decided to send me to\r\nthat intellectual Mecca, I did not receive the announcement with unmixed\r\nsatisfaction, as I had fixed my mind on Union College. The thought of a\r\nschool without boys, who had been to me such a stimulus both in study\r\nand play, seemed to my imagination dreary and profitless.\r\n\r\nThe one remarkable feature of my journey to Troy was the railroad from\r\nSchenectady to Albany, the first ever laid in this country. The manner\r\nof ascending a high hill going out of the city would now strike\r\nengineers as stupid to the last degree. The passenger cars were pulled\r\nup by a train, loaded with stones, descending the hill. The more\r\nrational way of tunneling through the hill or going around it had not\r\nyet dawned on our Dutch ancestors. At every step of my journey to Troy I\r\nfelt that I was treading on my pride, and thus in a hopeless frame of\r\nmind I began my boarding-school career. I had already studied everything\r\nthat was taught there except French, music, and dancing, so I devoted\r\nmyself to these accomplishments. As I had a good voice I enjoyed\r\nsinging, with a guitar accompaniment, and, having a good ear for time, I\r\nappreciated the harmony in music and motion and took great delight in\r\ndancing. The large house, the society of so many girls, the walks about\r\nthe city, the novelty of everything made the new life more enjoyable\r\nthan I had anticipated. To be sure I missed the boys, with whom I had\r\ngrown up, played with for years, and later measured my intellectual\r\npowers with, but, as they became a novelty, there was new zest in\r\noccasionally seeing them. After I had been there a short time, I heard a\r\ncall one day: \"Heads out!\" I ran with the rest and exclaimed, \"What is\r\nit?\" expecting to see a giraffe or some other wonder from Barnum's\r\nMuseum. \"Why, don't you see those boys?\" said one. \"Oh,\" I replied, \"is\r\nthat all? I have seen boys all my life.\" When visiting family friends in\r\nthe city, we were in the way of making the acquaintance of their sons,\r\nand as all social relations were strictly forbidden, there was a new\r\ninterest in seeing them. As they were not allowed to call upon us or\r\nwrite notes, unless they were brothers or cousins, we had, in time, a\r\nlarge number of kinsmen.\r\n\r\nThere was an intense interest to me now in writing notes, receiving\r\ncalls, and joining the young men in the streets for a walk, such as I\r\nhad never known when in constant association with them at school and in\r\nour daily amusements. Shut up with girls, most of them older than\r\nmyself, I heard many subjects discussed of which I had never thought\r\nbefore, and in a manner it were better I had never heard. The healthful\r\nrestraint always existing between boys and girls in conversation is apt\r\nto be relaxed with either sex alone. In all my intimate association with\r\nboys up to that period, I cannot recall one word or act for criticism,\r\nbut I cannot say the same of the girls during the three years I passed\r\nat the seminary in Troy. My own experience proves to me that it is a\r\ngrave mistake to send boys and girls to separate institutions of\r\nlearning, especially at the most impressible age. The stimulus of sex\r\npromotes alike a healthy condition of the intellectual and the moral\r\nfaculties and gives to both a development they never can acquire alone.\r\n\r\nMrs. Willard, having spent several months in Europe, did not return\r\nuntil I had been at the seminary some time. I well remember her arrival,\r\nand the joy with which she was greeted by the teachers and pupils who\r\nhad known her before. She was a splendid-looking woman, then in her\r\nprime, and fully realized my idea of a queen. I doubt whether any royal\r\npersonage in the Old World could have received her worshipers with more\r\ngrace and dignity than did this far-famed daughter of the Republic. She\r\nwas one of the remarkable women of that period, and did a great\r\neducational work for her sex. She gave free scholarships to a large\r\nnumber of promising girls, fitting them for teachers, with a proviso\r\nthat, when the opportunity arose, they should, in turn, educate others.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget one incident that occasioned me much unhappiness. I\r\nhad written a very amusing composition, describing my room. A friend\r\ncame in to see me just as I had finished it, and, as she asked me to\r\nread it to her, I did so. She enjoyed it very much and proposed an\r\nexchange. She said the rooms were all so nearly alike that, with a\r\nlittle alteration, she could use it. Being very susceptible to flattery,\r\nher praise of my production won a ready assent; but when I read her\r\nplatitudes I was sorry I had changed, and still more so in the\r\n_denouement_.\r\n\r\nThose selected to prepare compositions read them before the whole\r\nschool. My friend's was received with great laughter and applause. The\r\none I read not only fell flat, but nearly prostrated me also. As soon as\r\nI had finished, one of the young ladies left the room and, returning in\r\na few moments with her composition book, laid it before the teacher who\r\npresided that day, showing her the same composition I had just read. I\r\nwas called up at once to explain, but was so amazed and confounded that\r\nI could not speak, and I looked the personification of guilt. I saw at a\r\nglance the contemptible position I occupied and felt as if the last day\r\nhad come, that I stood before the judgment seat and had heard the awful\r\nsentence pronounced, \"Depart ye wicked into everlasting punishment.\" How\r\nI escaped from that scene to my own room I do not know. I was too\r\nwretched for tears. I sat alone for a long time when a gentle tap\r\nannounced my betrayer. She put her arms around me affectionately and\r\nkissed me again and again.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she said, \"you are a hero. You went through that trying ordeal\r\nlike a soldier. I was so afraid, when you were pressed with questions,\r\nthat the whole truth would come out and I be forced to stand in your\r\nplace. I am not so brave as you; I could not endure it. Now that you are\r\nthrough it and know how bitter a trial it is, promise that you will save\r\nme from the same experience. You are so good and noble I know you will\r\nnot betray me.\"\r\n\r\nIn this supreme moment of misery and disgrace, her loving words and warm\r\nembrace were like balm to my bruised soul and I readily promised all\r\nshe asked. The girl had penetrated the weak point in my character. I\r\nloved flattery. Through that means she got my composition in the first\r\nplace, pledged me to silence in the second place, and so confused my\r\nmoral perceptions that I really thought it praiseworthy to shelter her\r\nfrom what I had suffered. However, without betrayal on my part, the\r\ntrick came to light through the very means she took to make concealment\r\nsure. After compositions were read they were handed over to a certain\r\nteacher for criticism. Miss ---- had copied mine, and returned to me the\r\noriginal. I had not copied hers, so the two were in the same\r\nhandwriting--one with my name outside and one with Miss ----'s.\r\n\r\nAs I stood well in school, both for scholarship and behavior, my sudden\r\nfall from grace occasioned no end of discussion. So, as soon as the\r\nteacher discovered the two compositions in Miss ----'s writing, she came\r\nto me to inquire how I got one of Miss ----'s compositions. She said,\r\n\"Where is yours that you wrote for that day?\"\r\n\r\nTaking it from my portfolio, I replied, \"Here it is.\"\r\n\r\nShe then asked, \"Did you copy it from her book?\"\r\n\r\nI replied, \"No; I wrote it myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did you not read your own?\"\r\n\r\n\"We agreed to change,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know that Miss ---- had copied that from the book of another\r\nyoung lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not until I was accused of doing it myself before the whole\r\nschool.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not defend yourself on the spot?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not speak, neither did I know what to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why have you allowed yourself to remain in such a false position for a\r\nwhole week?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I had not found this out, did you intend to keep silent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Did Miss ---- ask you to do so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nI had been a great favorite with this teacher, but she was so disgusted\r\nwith my stupidity, as she called my timidity, that she said:\r\n\r\n\"Really, my child, you have not acted in this matter as if you had\r\nordinary common sense.\"\r\n\r\nSo little do grown people, in familiar surroundings, appreciate the\r\nconfusion of a child's faculties, under new and trying experiences. When\r\npoor Miss ----'s turn came to stand up before the whole school and take\r\nthe burden on her own shoulders she had so cunningly laid on mine, I\r\nreadily shed the tears for her I could not summon for myself. This was\r\nmy first sad lesson in human duplicity.\r\n\r\nThis episode, unfortunately, destroyed in a measure my confidence in my\r\ncompanions and made me suspicious even of those who came to me with\r\nappreciative words. Up to this time I had accepted all things as they\r\nseemed on the surface. Now I began to wonder what lay behind the visible\r\nconditions about me. Perhaps the experience was beneficial, as it is\r\nquite necessary for a young girl, thrown wholly on herself for the first\r\ntime among strangers, to learn caution in all she says and does. The\r\natmosphere of home life, where all disguises and pretensions are thrown\r\noff, is quite different from a large school of girls, with the petty\r\njealousies and antagonisms that arise in daily competition in their\r\ndress, studies, accomplishments, and amusements.\r\n\r\nThe next happening in Troy that seriously influenced my character was\r\nthe advent of the Rev. Charles G. Finney, a pulpit orator, who, as a\r\nterrifier of human souls, proved himself the equal of Savonarola. He\r\nheld a protracted meeting in the Rev. Dr. Beaman's church, which many of\r\nmy schoolmates attended. The result of six weeks of untiring effort on\r\nthe part of Mr. Finney and his confreres was one of those intense\r\nrevival seasons that swept over the city and through the seminary like\r\nan epidemic, attacking in its worst form the most susceptible. Owing to\r\nmy gloomy Calvinistic training in the old Scotch Presbyterian church,\r\nand my vivid imagination, I was one of the first victims. We attended\r\nall the public services, beside the daily prayer and experience meetings\r\nheld in the seminary. Our studies, for the time, held a subordinate\r\nplace to the more important duty of saving our souls.\r\n\r\nTo state the idea of conversion and salvation as then understood, one\r\ncan readily see from our present standpoint that nothing could be more\r\npuzzling and harrowing to the young mind. The revival fairly started,\r\nthe most excitable were soon on the anxious seat. There we learned the\r\ntotal depravity of human nature and the sinner's awful danger of\r\neverlasting punishment. This was enlarged upon until the most innocent\r\ngirl believed herself a monster of iniquity and felt certain of eternal\r\ndamnation. Then God's hatred of sin was emphasized and his\r\nirreconcilable position toward the sinner so justified that one felt\r\nlike a miserable, helpless, forsaken worm of the dust in trying to\r\napproach him, even in prayer.\r\n\r\nHaving brought you into a condition of profound humility, the only\r\ncardinal virtue for one under conviction, in the depths of your despair\r\nyou were told that it required no herculean effort on your part to be\r\ntransformed into an angel, to be reconciled to God, to escape endless\r\nperdition. The way to salvation was short and simple. We had naught to\r\ndo but to repent and believe and give our hearts to Jesus, who was ever\r\nready to receive them. How to do all this was the puzzling question.\r\nTalking with Dr. Finney one day, I said:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot understand what I am to do. If you should tell me to go to the\r\ntop of the church steeple and jump off, I would readily do it, if\r\nthereby I could save my soul; but I do not know how to go to Jesus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Repent and believe,\" said he, \"that is all you have to do to be happy\r\nhere and hereafter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry,\" I replied, \"for all the evil I have done, and I\r\nbelieve all you tell me, and the more sincerely I believe, the more\r\nunhappy I am.\"\r\n\r\nWith the natural reaction from despair to hope many of us imagined\r\nourselves converted, prayed and gave our experiences in the meetings,\r\nand at times rejoiced in the thought that we were Christians--chosen\r\nchildren of God--rather than sinners and outcasts.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Finney's terrible anathemas on the depravity and deceitfulness\r\nof the human heart soon shortened our newborn hopes. His appearance in\r\nthe pulpit on these memorable occasions is indelibly impressed on my\r\nmind. I can see him now, his great eyes rolling around the congregation\r\nand his arms flying about in the air like those of a windmill. One\r\nevening he described hell and the devil and the long procession of\r\nsinners being swept down the rapids, about to make the awful plunge\r\ninto the burning depths of liquid fire below, and the rejoicing hosts in\r\nthe inferno coming up to meet them with the shouts of the devils echoing\r\nthrough the vaulted arches. He suddenly halted, and, pointing his index\r\nfinger at the supposed procession, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"There, do you not see them!\"\r\n\r\nI was wrought up to such a pitch that I actually jumped up and gazed in\r\nthe direction to which he pointed, while the picture glowed before my\r\neyes and remained with me for months afterward. I cannot forbear saying\r\nthat, although high respect is due to the intellectual, moral, and\r\nspiritual gifts of the venerable ex-president of Oberlin College, such\r\npreaching worked incalculable harm to the very souls he sought to save.\r\nFear of the judgment seized my soul. Visions of the lost haunted my\r\ndreams. Mental anguish prostrated my health. Dethronement of my reason\r\nwas apprehended by friends. But he was sincere, so peace to his ashes!\r\nReturning home, I often at night roused my father from his slumbers to\r\npray for me, lest I should be cast into the bottomless pit before\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nTo change the current of my thoughts, a trip was planned to Niagara, and\r\nit was decided that the subject of religion was to be tabooed\r\naltogether. Accordingly our party, consisting of my sister, her husband,\r\nmy father and myself, started in our private carriage, and for six weeks\r\nI heard nothing on the subject. About this time Gall and Spurzheim\r\npublished their works on phrenology, followed by Combe's \"Constitution\r\nof Man,\" his \"Moral Philosophy,\" and many other liberal works, all so\r\nrational and opposed to the old theologies that they produced a profound\r\nimpression on my brother-in-law's mind. As we had these books with us,\r\nreading and discussing by the way, we all became deeply interested in\r\nthe new ideas. Thus, after many months of weary wandering in the\r\nintellectual labyrinth of \"The Fall of Man,\" \"Original Sin,\" \"Total\r\nDepravity,\" \"God's Wrath,\" \"Satan's Triumph,\" \"The Crucifixion,\" \"The\r\nAtonement,\" and \"Salvation by Faith,\" I found my way out of the darkness\r\ninto the clear sunlight of Truth. My religious superstitions gave place\r\nto rational ideas based on scientific facts, and in proportion, as I\r\nlooked at everything from a new standpoint, I grew more and more happy,\r\nday by day. Thus, with a delightful journey in the month of June, an\r\nentire change in my course of reading and the current of my thoughts, my\r\nmind was restored to its normal condition. I view it as one of the\r\ngreatest crimes to shadow the minds of the young with these gloomy\r\nsuperstitions; and with fears of the unknown and the unknowable to\r\npoison all their joy in life.\r\n\r\nAfter the restraints of childhood at home and in school, what a period\r\nof irrepressible joy and freedom comes to us in girlhood with the first\r\ntaste of liberty. Then is our individuality in a measure recognized and\r\nour feelings and opinions consulted; then we decide where and when we\r\nwill come and go, what we will eat, drink, wear, and do. To suit one's\r\nown fancy in clothes, to buy what one likes, and wear what one chooses\r\nis a great privilege to most young people. To go out at pleasure, to\r\nwalk, to ride, to drive, with no one to say us nay or question our right\r\nto liberty, this is indeed like a birth into a new world of happiness\r\nand freedom. This is the period, too, when the emotions rule us, and we\r\nidealize everything in life; when love and hope make the present an\r\necstasy and the future bright with anticipation.\r\n\r\nThen comes that dream of bliss that for weeks and months throws a halo\r\nof glory round the most ordinary characters in every-day life, holding\r\nthe strongest and most common-sense young men and women in a thraldom\r\nfrom which few mortals escape. The period when love, in soft silver\r\ntones, whispers his first words of adoration, painting our graces and\r\nvirtues day by day in living colors in poetry and prose, stealthily\r\npunctuated ever and anon with a kiss or fond embrace. What dignity it\r\nadds to a young girl's estimate of herself when some strong man makes\r\nher feel that in her hands rest his future peace and happiness! Though\r\nthese seasons of intoxication may come once to all, yet they are seldom\r\nrepeated. How often in after life we long for one more such rapturous\r\ndream of bliss, one more season of supreme human love and passion!\r\n\r\nAfter leaving school, until my marriage, I had the most pleasant years\r\nof my girlhood. With frequent visits to a large circle of friends and\r\nrelatives in various towns and cities, the monotony of home life was\r\nsufficiently broken to make our simple country pleasures always\r\ndelightful and enjoyable. An entirely new life now opened to me. The old\r\nbondage of fear of the visible and the invisible was broken and, no\r\nlonger subject to absolute authority, I rejoiced in the dawn of a new\r\nday of freedom in thought and action.\r\n\r\nMy brother-in-law, Edward Bayard, ten years my senior, was an\r\ninestimable blessing to me at this time, especially as my mind was just\r\nthen opening to the consideration of all the varied problems of life. To\r\nme and my sisters he was a companion in all our amusements, a teacher\r\nin the higher departments of knowledge, and a counselor in all our\r\nyouthful trials and disappointments. He was of a metaphysical turn of\r\nmind, and in the pursuit of truth was in no way trammeled by popular\r\nsuperstitions. He took nothing for granted and, like Socrates, went\r\nabout asking questions. Nothing pleased him more than to get a bevy of\r\nbright young girls about him and teach them how to think clearly and\r\nreason logically.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage of the years my sisters and myself spent at the Troy\r\nSeminary was the large number of pleasant acquaintances we made there,\r\nmany of which ripened into lifelong friendships. From time to time many\r\nof our classmates visited us, and all alike enjoyed the intellectual\r\nfencing in which my brother-in-law drilled them. He discoursed with us\r\non law, philosophy, political economy, history, and poetry, and together\r\nwe read novels without number. The long winter evenings thus passed\r\npleasantly, Mr. Bayard alternately talking and reading aloud Scott,\r\nBulwer, James, Cooper, and Dickens, whose works were just then coming\r\nout in numbers from week to week, always leaving us in suspense at the\r\nmost critical point of the story. Our readings were varied with\r\nrecitations, music, dancing, and games.\r\n\r\nAs we all enjoyed brisk exercise, even with the thermometer below zero,\r\nwe took long walks and sleighrides during the day, and thus the winter\r\nmonths glided quickly by, while the glorious summer on those blue hills\r\nwas a period of unmixed enjoyment. At this season we arose at five in\r\nthe morning for a long ride on horseback through the beautiful Mohawk\r\nValley and over the surrounding hills. Every road and lane in that\r\nregion was as familiar to us and our ponies, as were the trees to the\r\nsquirrels we frightened as we cantered by their favorite resorts.\r\n\r\nPart of the time Margaret Christie, a young girl of Scotch descent, was\r\na member of our family circle. She taught us French, music, and dancing.\r\nOur days were too short for all we had to do, for our time was not\r\nwholly given to pleasure. We were required to keep our rooms in order,\r\nmend and make our clothes, and do our own ironing. The latter was one of\r\nmy mother's politic requirements, to make our laundry lists as short as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIroning on hot days in summer was a sore trial to all of us; but Miss\r\nChristie, being of an inventive turn of mind, soon taught us a short way\r\nout of it. She folded and smoothed her undergarments with her hands and\r\nthen sat on them for a specified time. We all followed her example and\r\nthus utilized the hours devoted to our French lessons and, while reading\r\n\"Corinne\" and \"Télémaque,\" in this primitive style we ironed our\r\nclothes. But for dresses, collars and cuffs, and pocket handkerchiefs,\r\nwe were compelled to wield the hot iron, hence with these articles we\r\nused all due economy, and my mother's object was thus accomplished.\r\n\r\nAs I had become sufficiently philosophical to talk over my religious\r\nexperiences calmly with my classmates who had been with me through the\r\nFinney revival meetings, we all came to the same conclusion--that we had\r\npassed through no remarkable change and that we had not been born again,\r\nas they say, for we found our tastes and enjoyments the same as ever. My\r\nbrother-in-law explained to us the nature of the delusion we had all\r\nexperienced, the physical conditions, the mental processes, the church\r\nmachinery by which such excitements are worked up, and the impositions\r\nto which credulous minds are necessarily subjected. As we had all been\r\nthrough that period of depression and humiliation, and had been\r\noppressed at times with the feeling that all our professions were arrant\r\nhypocrisy and that our last state was worse than our first, he helped us\r\nto understand these workings of the human mind and reconciled us to the\r\nmore rational condition in which we now found ourselves. He never grew\r\nweary of expounding principles to us and dissipating the fogs and mists\r\nthat gather over young minds educated in an atmosphere of superstition.\r\n\r\nWe had a constant source of amusement and vexation in the students in my\r\nfather's office. A succession of them was always coming fresh from\r\ncollege and full of conceit. Aching to try their powers of debate on\r\ngraduates from the Troy Seminary, they politely questioned all our\r\ntheories and assertions. However, with my brother-in-law's training in\r\nanalysis and logic, we were a match for any of them. Nothing pleased me\r\nbetter than a long argument with them on woman's equality, which I tried\r\nto prove by a diligent study of the books they read and the games they\r\nplayed. I confess that I did not study so much for a love of the truth\r\nor my own development, in these days, as to make those young men\r\nrecognize my equality. I soon noticed that, after losing a few games of\r\nchess, my opponent talked less of masculine superiority. Sister Madge\r\nwould occasionally rush to the defense with an emphatic \"Fudge for these\r\nlaws, all made by men! I'll never obey one of them. And as to the\r\nstudents with their impertinent talk of superiority, all they need is\r\nsuch a shaking up as I gave the most disagreeable one yesterday. I\r\ninvited him to take a ride on horseback. He accepted promptly, and said\r\nhe would be most happy to go. Accordingly I told Peter to saddle the\r\ntoughest-mouthed, hardest-trotting carriage horse in the stable. Mounted\r\non my swift pony, I took a ten-mile canter as fast as I could go, with\r\nthat superior being at my heels calling, as he found breath, for me to\r\nstop, which I did at last and left him in the hands of Peter, half dead\r\nat his hotel, where he will be laid out, with all his marvelous\r\nmasculine virtues, for a week at least. Now do not waste your arguments\r\non these prigs from Union College. Take each, in turn, the ten-miles'\r\ncircuit on 'Old Boney' and they'll have no breath left to prate of\r\nwoman's inferiority. You might argue with them all day, and you could\r\nnot make them feel so small as I made that popinjay feel in one hour. I\r\nknew 'Old Boney' would keep up with me, if he died for it, and that my\r\nescort could neither stop nor dismount, except by throwing himself from\r\nthe saddle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Madge!\" I exclaimed; \"what will you say when he meets you again?\"\r\n\r\n\"If he complains, I will say 'the next time you ride see that you have a\r\ncurb bit before starting.' Surely, a man ought to know what is necessary\r\nto manage a horse, and not expect a woman to tell him.\"\r\n\r\nOur lives were still further varied and intensified by the usual number\r\nof flirtations, so called, more or less lasting or evanescent, from all\r\nof which I emerged, as from my religious experiences, in a more rational\r\nframe of mind. We had been too much in the society of boys and young\r\ngentlemen, and knew too well their real character, to idealize the sex\r\nin general. In addition to our own observations, we had the advantage\r\nof our brother-in-law's wisdom. Wishing to save us as long as possible\r\nfrom all matrimonial entanglements, he was continually unveiling those\r\nwith whom he associated, and so critically portraying their intellectual\r\nand moral condition that it was quite impossible, in our most worshipful\r\nmoods, to make gods of any of the sons of Adam.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of all our own experiences and of all the warning\r\nwords of wisdom from those who had seen life in its many phases, we\r\nentered the charmed circle at last, all but one marrying into the legal\r\nprofession, with its odious statute laws and infamous decisions. And\r\nthis, after reading Blackstone, Kent, and Story, and thoroughly\r\nunderstanding the status of the wife under the old common law of\r\nEngland, which was in force at that time in most of the States of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nLIFE AT PETERBORO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year, with us, was never considered complete without a visit to\r\nPeterboro, N.Y., the home of Gerrit Smith. Though he was a reformer and\r\nwas very radical in many of his ideas, yet, being a man of broad\r\nsympathies, culture, wealth, and position, he drew around him many\r\nfriends of the most conservative opinions. He was a man of fine\r\npresence, rare physical beauty, most affable and courteous in manner,\r\nand his hospitalities were generous to an extreme, and dispensed to all\r\nclasses of society.\r\n\r\nEvery year representatives from the Oneida tribe of Indians visited him.\r\nHis father had early purchased of them large tracts of land, and there\r\nwas a tradition among them that, as an equivalent for the good bargains\r\nof the father, they had a right to the son's hospitality, with annual\r\ngifts of clothing and provisions. The slaves, too, had heard of Gerrit\r\nSmith, the abolitionist, and of Peterboro as one of the safe points _en\r\nroute_ for Canada. His mansion was, in fact, one of the stations on the\r\n\"underground railroad\" for slaves escaping from bondage. Hence they,\r\ntoo, felt that they had a right to a place under his protecting roof. On\r\nsuch occasions the barn and the kitchen floor were utilized as chambers\r\nfor the black man from the southern plantation and the red man from his\r\nhome in the forest.\r\n\r\nThe spacious home was always enlivened with choice society from every\r\npart of the country. There one would meet members of the families of the\r\nold Dutch aristocracy, the Van Rensselaers, the Van Vechtens, the\r\nSchuylers, the Livingstons, the Bleeckers, the Brinkerhoffs, the Ten\r\nEycks, the Millers, the Seymours, the Cochranes, the Biddles, the\r\nBarclays, the Wendells, and many others.\r\n\r\nAs the lady of the house, Ann Carroll Fitzhugh, was the daughter of a\r\nwealthy slaveholder of Maryland, many agreeable Southerners were often\r\namong the guests. Our immediate family relatives were well represented\r\nby General John Cochrane and his sisters, General Baird and his wife\r\nfrom West Point, the Fitzhughs from Oswego and Geneseo, the Backuses and\r\nTallmans from Rochester, and the Swifts from Geneva. Here one was sure\r\nto meet scholars, philosophers, philanthropists, judges, bishops,\r\nclergymen, and statesmen.\r\n\r\nJudge Alfred Conkling, the father of Roscoe Conkling, was, in his late\r\nyears, frequently seen at Peterboro. Tall and stately, after all life's\r\ntroubled scenes, financial losses and domestic sorrows, he used to say\r\nthere was no spot on earth that seemed so like his idea of Paradise. The\r\nproud, reserved judge was unaccustomed to manifestations of affection\r\nand tender interest in his behalf, and when Gerrit, taking him by both\r\nhands would, in his softest tones say, \"Good-morning,\" and inquire how\r\nhe had slept and what he would like to do that day, and Nancy would\r\ngreet him with equal warmth and pin a little bunch of roses in his\r\nbuttonhole, I have seen the tears in his eyes. Their warm sympathies and\r\nsweet simplicity of manner melted the sternest natures and made the most\r\nreserved amiable. There never was such an atmosphere of love and peace,\r\nof freedom and good cheer, in any other home I visited. And this was the\r\nuniversal testimony of those who were guests at Peterboro. To go\r\nanywhere else, after a visit there, was like coming down from the divine\r\nheights into the valley of humiliation.\r\n\r\nHow changed from the early days when, as strict Presbyterians, they\r\nbelieved in all the doctrines of Calvin! Then, an indefinite gloom\r\npervaded their home. Their consciences were diseased. They attached such\r\nundue importance to forms that they went through three kinds of baptism.\r\nAt one time Nancy would read nothing but the Bible, sing nothing but\r\nhymns, and play only sacred music. She felt guilty if she talked on any\r\nsubject except religion. She was, in all respects, a fitting mate for\r\nher attractive husband. Exquisitely refined in feeling and manner,\r\nbeautiful in face and form, earnest and sincere, she sympathized with\r\nhim in all his ideas of religion and reform. Together they passed\r\nthrough every stage of theological experience, from the uncertain ground\r\nof superstition and speculation to the solid foundation of science and\r\nreason. The position of the Church in the anti-slavery conflict, opening\r\nas it did all questions of ecclesiastical authority, Bible\r\ninterpretation, and church discipline, awakened them to new thought and\r\nbroader views on religious subjects, and eventually emancipated them\r\nentirely from the old dogmas and formalities of their faith, and lifted\r\nthem into the cheerful atmosphere in which they passed the remainder of\r\ntheir lives. Their only daughter, Elizabeth, added greatly to the\r\nattractions of the home circle, as she drew many young people round her.\r\nBeside her personal charm she was the heiress of a vast estate and had\r\nmany admirers. The favored one was Charles Dudley Miller of Utica,\r\nnephew of Mrs. Blandina Bleecker Dudley, founder of the Albany\r\nObservatory. At the close of his college life Mr. Miller had not only\r\nmastered the languages, mathematics, rhetoric, and logic, but had\r\nlearned the secret windings of the human heart. He understood the art of\r\npleasing.\r\n\r\nThese were the times when the anti-slavery question was up for hot\r\ndiscussion. In all the neighboring towns conventions were held in which\r\nJames G. Birney, a Southern gentleman who had emancipated his slaves,\r\nCharles Stuart of Scotland, and George Thompson of England, Garrison,\r\nPhillips, May, Beriah Greene, Foster, Abby Kelly, Lucretia Mott,\r\nDouglass, and others took part. Here, too, John Brown, Sanborn, Morton,\r\nand Frederick Douglass met to talk over that fatal movement on Harper's\r\nFerry. On the question of temperance, also, the people were in a\r\nferment. Dr. Cheever's pamphlet, \"Deacon Giles' Distillery,\" was\r\nscattered far and wide, and, as he was sued for libel, the question was\r\ndiscussed in the courts as well as at every fireside. Then came the\r\nFather Matthew and Washingtonian movements, and the position of the\r\nChurch on these questions intensified and embittered the conflict. This\r\nbrought the Cheevers, the Pierponts, the Delevans, the Nortons, and\r\ntheir charming wives to Peterboro. It was with such company and varied\r\ndiscussions on every possible phase of political, religious, and social\r\nlife that I spent weeks every year. Gerrit Smith was cool and calm in\r\ndebate, and, as he was armed at all points on these subjects, he could\r\nafford to be patient and fair with an opponent, whether on the platform\r\nor at the fireside. These rousing arguments at Peterboro made social\r\nlife seem tame and profitless elsewhere, and the youngest of us felt\r\nthat the conclusions reached in this school of philosophy were not to be\r\nquestioned. The sisters of General Cochrane, in disputes with their\r\nDutch cousins in Schenectady and Albany, would end all controversy by\r\nsaying, \"This question was fully discussed at Peterboro, and settled.\"\r\n\r\nThe youngsters frequently put the lessons of freedom and individual\r\nrights they heard so much of into practice, and relieved their brains\r\nfrom the constant strain of argument on first principles, by the wildest\r\nhilarity in dancing, all kinds of games, and practical jokes carried\r\nbeyond all bounds of propriety. These romps generally took place at Mr.\r\nMiller's. He used to say facetiously, that they talked a good deal about\r\nliberty over the way, but he kept the goddess under his roof. One\r\nmemorable occasion in which our enthusiasm was kept at white heat for\r\ntwo hours I must try to describe, though words cannot do it justice, as\r\nit was pre-eminently a spectacular performance. The imagination even\r\ncannot do justice to the limp, woe-begone appearance of the actors in\r\nthe closing scene. These romps were conducted on a purely democratic\r\nbasis, without regard to color, sex, or previous condition of servitude.\r\n\r\nIt was rather a cold day in the month of March, when \"Cousin Charley,\"\r\nas we called Mr. Miller, was superintending some men who were laying a\r\nplank walk in the rear of his premises. Some half dozen of us were\r\ninvited to an early tea at good Deacon Huntington's. Immediately after\r\ndinner, Miss Fitzhugh and Miss Van Schaack decided to take a nap, that\r\nthey might appear as brilliant as possible during the evening. That they\r\nmight not be late, as they invariably were, Cousin Lizzie and I decided\r\nto rouse them in good season with a generous sprinkling of cold water.\r\nIn vain they struggled to keep the blankets around them; with equal\r\nforce we pulled them away, and, whenever a stray finger or toe appeared,\r\nwe brought fresh batteries to bear, until they saw that passive\r\nresistance must give place to active hostility. We were armed with two\r\nwatering pots. They armed themselves with two large-sized syringes used\r\nfor showering potato bugs. With these weapons they gave us chase\r\ndownstairs. We ran into a closet and held the door shut. They quietly\r\nwaited our forthcoming. As soon as we opened the door to peep out, Miss\r\nFitzhugh, who was large and strong, pulled it wide open and showered us\r\nwith a vengeance. Then they fled into a large pantry where stood several\r\npans of milk.\r\n\r\nAt this stage Cousin Charley, hearing the rumpus, came to our\r\nassistance. He locked them in the pantry and returned to his work,\r\nwhereupon they opened the window and showered him with milk, while he,\r\nin turn, pelted them with wet clothes, soaking in tubs near by. As they\r\nwere thinly clad, wet to the skin, and the cold March wind blew round\r\nthem (we were all in fatigue costume in starting) they implored us to\r\nlet them out, which we did, and, in return for our kindness, they gave\r\nus a broadside of milk in our faces. Cousin Lizzie and I fled to the\r\ndark closet, where they locked us in. After long, weary waiting they\r\ncame to offer us terms of capitulation. Lizzie agreed to fill their guns\r\nwith milk, and give them our watering pots full of water, and I agreed\r\nto call Cousin Charley under my window until they emptied the contents\r\nof guns and pots on his head. My room was on the first floor, and Miss\r\nFitzhugh's immediately overhead. On these terms we accepted our freedom.\r\nAccordingly, I gently raised the window and called Charley\r\nconfidentially within whispering distance, when down came a shower of\r\nwater. As he stepped back to look up and see whence it came, and who\r\nmade the attack, a stream of milk hit him on the forehead, his heels\r\nstruck a plank, and he fell backward, to all appearance knocked down\r\nwith a stream of milk. His humiliation was received with shouts of\r\nderisive laughter, and even the carpenters at work laid down their\r\nhammers and joined in the chorus; but his revenge was swift and capped\r\nthe climax. Cold and wet as we all were, and completely tired out, we\r\ncommenced to disrobe and get ready for the tea party. Unfortunately I\r\nhad forgotten to lock my door, and in walked Cousin Charley with a quart\r\nbottle of liquid blacking, which he prepared to empty on my devoted\r\nhead. I begged so eloquently and trembled so at the idea of being dyed\r\nblack, that he said he would let me off on one condition, and that was\r\nto get him, by some means, into Miss Fitzhugh's room. So I ran screaming\r\nup the stairs, as if hotly pursued by the enemy, and begged her to let\r\nme in. She cautiously opened the door, but when she saw Charley behind\r\nme she tried to force it shut. However, he was too quick for her. He had\r\none leg and arm in; but, at that stage of her toilet, to let him in was\r\nimpossible, and there they stood, equally strong, firmly braced, she on\r\none side of the door and he on the other. But the blacking he was\r\ndetermined she should have; so, gauging her probable position, with one\r\ndesperate effort he squeezed in a little farther and, raising the\r\nbottle, he poured the contents on her head. The blacking went streaming\r\ndown over her face, white robe, and person, and left her looking more\r\nlike a bronze fury than one of Eve's most charming daughters. A yard or\r\nmore of the carpet was ruined, the wallpaper and bedclothes spattered,\r\nand the poor victim was unfit to be seen for a week at least. Charley\r\nhad a good excuse for his extreme measures, for, as we all by turn\r\nplayed our tricks on him, it was necessary to keep us in some fear of\r\npunishment. This was but one of the many outrageous pranks we\r\nperpetrated on each other. To see us a few hours later, all absorbed in\r\nan anti-slavery or temperance convention, or dressed in our best, in\r\nhigh discourse with the philosophers, one would never think we could\r\nhave been guilty of such consummate follies. It was, however, but the\r\nnatural reaction from the general serious trend of our thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt was in Peterboro, too, that I first met one who was then considered\r\nthe most eloquent and impassioned orator on the anti-slavery platform,\r\nHenry B. Stanton. He had come over from Utica with Alvin Stewart's\r\nbeautiful daughter, to whom report said he was engaged; but, as she soon\r\nafter married Luther R. Marsh, there was a mistake somewhere. However,\r\nthe rumor had its advantages. Regarding him as not in the matrimonial\r\nmarket, we were all much more free and easy in our manners with him than\r\nwe would otherwise have been. A series of anti-slavery conventions was\r\nbeing held in Madison County, and there I had the pleasure of hearing\r\nhim for the first time. As I had a passion for oratory, I was deeply\r\nimpressed with his power. He was not so smooth and eloquent as Phillips,\r\nbut he could make his audience both laugh and cry; the latter, Phillips\r\nhimself said he never could do. Mr. Stanton was then in his prime, a\r\nfine-looking, affable young man, with remarkable conversational talent,\r\nand was ten years my senior, with the advantage that number of years\r\nnecessarily gives.\r\n\r\nTwo carriage-loads of ladies and gentlemen drove off every morning,\r\nsometimes ten miles, to one of these conventions, returning late at\r\nnight. I shall never forget those charming drives over the hills in\r\nMadison County, the bright autumnal days, and the bewitching moonlight\r\nnights. The enthusiasm of the people in these great meetings, the\r\nthrilling oratory, and lucid arguments of the speakers, all conspired to\r\nmake these days memorable as among the most charming in my life. It\r\nseemed to me that I never had so much happiness crowded into one short\r\nmonth. I had become interested in the anti-slavery and temperance\r\nquestions, and was deeply impressed with the appeals and arguments. I\r\nfelt a new inspiration in life and was enthused with new ideas of\r\nindividual rights and the basic principles of government, for the\r\nanti-slavery platform was the best school the American people ever had\r\non which to learn republican principles and ethics. These conventions\r\nand the discussions at my cousin's fireside I count among the great\r\nblessings of my life.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as we came out from breakfast, Mr. Stanton joined me on the\r\npiazza, where I was walking up and down enjoying the balmy air and the\r\nbeauty of the foliage. \"As we have no conventions,\" said he, \"on hand,\r\nwhat do you say to a ride on horseback this morning?\" I readily accepted\r\nthe suggestion, ordered the horses, put on my habit, and away we went.\r\nThe roads were fine and we took a long ride. As we were returning home\r\nwe stopped often to admire the scenery and, perchance, each other. When\r\nwalking slowly through a beautiful grove, he laid his hand on the horn\r\nof the saddle and, to my surprise, made one of those charming\r\nrevelations of human feeling which brave knights have always found\r\neloquent words to utter, and to which fair ladies have always listened\r\nwith mingled emotions of pleasure and astonishment.\r\n\r\nOne outcome of those glorious days of October, 1839, was a marriage, in\r\nJohnstown, the 10th day of May, 1840, and a voyage to the Old World.\r\n\r\nSix weeks of that charming autumn, ending in the Indian summer with its\r\npeculiarly hazy atmosphere, I lingered in Peterboro. It seems in\r\nretrospect like a beautiful dream. A succession of guests was constantly\r\ncoming and going, and I still remember the daily drives over those grand\r\nold hills crowned with trees now gorgeous in rich colors, the more\r\ncharming because we knew the time was short before the cold winds of\r\nNovember would change all.\r\n\r\nThe early setting sun warned us that the shortening days must soon end\r\nour twilight drives, and the moonlight nights were too chilly to linger\r\nlong in the rustic arbors or shady nooks outside. With the peculiar\r\ncharm of this season of the year there is always a touch of sadness in\r\nnature, and it seemed doubly so to me, as my engagement was not one of\r\nunmixed joy and satisfaction. Among all conservative families there was\r\na strong aversion to abolitionists and the whole anti-slavery movement.\r\nAlone with Cousin Gerrit in his library he warned me, in deep, solemn\r\ntones, while strongly eulogizing my lover, that my father would never\r\nconsent to my marriage with an abolitionist. He felt in duty bound, as\r\nmy engagement had occurred under his roof, to free himself from all\r\nresponsibility by giving me a long dissertation on love, friendship,\r\nmarriage, and all the pitfalls for the unwary, who, without due\r\nconsideration, formed matrimonial relations. The general principles laid\r\ndown in this interview did not strike my youthful mind so forcibly as\r\nthe suggestion that it was better to announce my engagement by letter\r\nthan to wait until I returned home, as thus I might draw the hottest\r\nfire while still in safe harbor, where Cousin Gerrit could help me\r\ndefend the weak points in my position. So I lingered at Peterboro to\r\nprolong the dream of happiness and postpone the conflict I feared to\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\nBut the Judge understood the advantage of our position as well as we\r\ndid, and wasted no ammunition on us. Being even more indignant at my\r\ncousin than at me, he quietly waited until I returned home, when I\r\npassed through the ordeal of another interview, with another\r\ndissertation on domestic relations from a financial standpoint. These\r\nwere two of the most bewildering interviews I ever had. They succeeded\r\nin making me feel that the step I proposed to take was the most\r\nmomentous and far-reaching in its consequences of any in this mortal\r\nlife. Heretofore my apprehensions had all been of death and eternity;\r\nnow life itself was filled with fears and anxiety as to the\r\npossibilities of the future. Thus these two noble men, who would have\r\ndone anything for my happiness, actually overweighted my conscience and\r\nturned the sweetest dream of my life into a tragedy. How little strong\r\nmen, with their logic, sophistry, and hypothetical examples, appreciate\r\nthe violence they inflict on the tender sensibilities of a woman's\r\nheart, in trying to subjugate her to their will! The love of protecting\r\ntoo often degenerates into downright tyranny. Fortunately all these\r\nsombre pictures of a possible future were thrown into the background by\r\nthe tender missives every post brought me, in which the brilliant\r\nword-painting of one of the most eloquent pens of this generation made\r\nthe future for us both, as bright and beautiful as Spring with her\r\nverdure and blossoms of promise.\r\n\r\nHowever, many things were always transpiring at Peterboro to turn one's\r\nthoughts and rouse new interest in humanity at large. One day, as a bevy\r\nof us girls were singing and chattering in the parlor, Cousin Gerrit\r\nentered and, in mysterious tones, said: \"I have a most important secret\r\nto tell you, which you must keep to yourselves religiously for\r\ntwenty-four hours.\"\r\n\r\nWe readily pledged ourselves in the most solemn manner, individually and\r\ncollectively.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, \"follow me to the third story.\"\r\n\r\nThis we did, wondering what the secret could be. At last, opening a\r\ndoor, he ushered us into a large room, in the center of which sat a\r\nbeautiful quadroon girl, about eighteen years of age. Addressing her, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Harriet, I have brought all my young cousins to see you. I want you to\r\nmake good abolitionists of them by telling them the history of your\r\nlife--what you have seen and suffered in slavery.\"\r\n\r\nTurning to us he said:\r\n\r\n\"Harriet has just escaped from her master, who is visiting in Syracuse,\r\nand is on her way to Canada. She will start this evening and you may\r\nnever have another opportunity of seeing a slave girl face to face, so\r\nask her all you care to know of the system of slavery.\"\r\n\r\nFor two hours we listened to the sad story of her childhood and youth,\r\nseparated from all her family and sold for her beauty in a New Orleans\r\nmarket when but fourteen years of age. The details of her story I need\r\nnot repeat. The fate of such girls is too well known to need rehearsal.\r\nWe all wept together as she talked, and, when Cousin Gerrit returned to\r\nsummon us away, we needed no further education to make us earnest\r\nabolitionists.\r\n\r\nDressed as a Quakeress, Harriet started at twilight with one of Mr.\r\nSmith's faithful clerks in a carriage for Oswego, there to cross the\r\nlake to Canada. The next day her master and the marshals from Syracuse\r\nwere on her track in Peterboro, and traced her to Mr. Smith's premises.\r\nHe was quite gracious in receiving them, and, while assuring them that\r\nthere was no slave there, he said that they were at liberty to make a\r\nthorough search of the house and grounds. He invited them to stay and\r\ndine and kept them talking as long as possible, as every hour helped\r\nHarriet to get beyond their reach; for, although she had eighteen hours\r\nthe start of them, yet we feared some accident might have delayed her.\r\nThe master was evidently a gentleman, for, on Mr. Smith's assurance that\r\nHarriet was not there, he made no search, feeling that they could not do\r\nso without appearing to doubt his word. He was evidently surprised to\r\nfind an abolitionist so courteous and affable, and it was interesting to\r\nhear them in conversation, at dinner, calmly discussing the problem of\r\nslavery, while public sentiment was at white heat on the question. They\r\nshook hands warmly at parting and expressed an equal interest in the\r\nfinal adjustment of that national difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn due time the clerk returned with the good news that Harriet was safe\r\nwith friends in a good situation in Canada. Mr. Smith then published an\r\nopen letter to the master in the New York _Tribune_, saying \"that he\r\nwould no doubt rejoice to know that his slave Harriet, in whose fate he\r\nfelt so deep an interest, was now a free woman, safe under the shadow of\r\nthe British throne. I had the honor of entertaining her under my roof,\r\nsending her in my carriage to Lake Ontario, just eighteen hours before\r\nyour arrival: hence my willingness to have you search my premises.\"\r\n\r\nLike the varied combinations of the kaleidoscope, the scenes in our\r\nsocial life at Peterboro were continually changing from grave to gay.\r\nSome years later we had a most hilarious occasion at the marriage of\r\nMary Cochrane, sister of General John Cochrane, to Chapman Biddle, of\r\nPhiladelphia. The festivities, which were kept up for three days,\r\ninvolved most elaborate preparations for breakfasts, dinners, etc.,\r\nthere being no Delmonico's in that remote part of the country. It was\r\ndecided in family council that we had sufficient culinary talent under\r\nthe roof to prepare the entire _menu_ of substantials and delicacies,\r\nfrom soup and salmon to cakes and creams. So, gifted ladies and\r\ngentlemen were impressed into the service. The Fitzhughs all had a\r\nnatural talent for cooking, and chief among them was Isabella, wife of a\r\nnaval officer,--Lieutenant Swift of Geneva,--who had made a profound\r\nstudy of all the authorities from Archestratus, a poet in Syracuse, the\r\nmost famous cook among the Greeks, down to our own Miss Leslie.\r\nAccordingly she was elected manager of the occasion, and to each one was\r\nassigned the specialty in which she claimed to excel. Those who had no\r\nspecialty were assistants to those who had. In this humble\r\noffice--\"assistant at large\"--I labored throughout.\r\n\r\nCooking is a high art. A wise Egyptian said, long ago: \"The degree of\r\ntaste and skill manifested by a nation in the preparation of food may be\r\nregarded as to a very considerable extent proportioned to its culture\r\nand refinement.\" In early times men, only, were deemed capable of\r\nhandling fire, whether at the altar or the hearthstone. We read in the\r\nScriptures that Abraham prepared cakes of fine meal and a calf tender\r\nand good, which, with butter and milk, he set before the three angels in\r\nthe plains of Mamre. We are told, too, of the chief butler and chief\r\nbaker as officers in the household of King Pharaoh. I would like to call\r\nthe attention of my readers to the dignity of this profession, which\r\nsome young women affect to despise. The fact that angels eat, shows that\r\nwe may be called upon in the next sphere to cook even for cherubim and\r\nseraphim. How important, then, to cultivate one's gifts in that\r\ndirection!\r\n\r\nWith such facts before us, we stirred and pounded, whipped and ground,\r\ncoaxed the delicate meats from crabs and lobsters and the succulent peas\r\nfrom the pods, and grated corn and cocoanut with the same cheerfulness\r\nand devotion that we played Mendelssohn's \"Songs Without Words\" on the\r\npiano, the Spanish Fandango on our guitars, or danced the minuet, polka,\r\nlancers, or Virginia reel.\r\n\r\nDuring the day of the wedding, every stage coach was crowded with guests\r\nfrom the North, South, East, and West, and, as the twilight deepened,\r\ncarriages began to roll in with neighbors and friends living at short\r\ndistances, until the house and grounds were full. A son of Bishop Coxe,\r\nwho married the tall and stately sister of Roscoe Conkling, performed\r\nthe ceremony. The beautiful young bride was given away by her Uncle\r\nGerrit. The congratulations, the feast, and all went off with fitting\r\ndecorum in the usual way. The best proof of the excellence of our viands\r\nwas that they were all speedily swept from mortal view, and every\r\nhousewife wanted a recipe for something.\r\n\r\nAs the grand dinner was to come off the next day, our thoughts now\r\nturned in that direction. The responsibility rested heavily on the heads\r\nof the chief actors, and they reported troubled dreams and unduly early\r\nrising. Dear Belle Swift was up in season and her white soup stood\r\nserenely in a tin pan, on an upper shelf, before the town clock struck\r\nseven. If it had not taken that position so early, it might have been\r\nincorporated with higher forms of life than that into which it\r\neventually fell. Another artist was also on the wing early, and in\r\npursuit of a tin pan in which to hide her precious compound, she\r\nunwittingly seized this one, and the rich white soup rolled down her\r\nraven locks like the oil on Aaron's beard, and enveloped her in a veil\r\nof filmy whiteness. I heard the splash and the exclamation of surprise\r\nand entered the butler's pantry just in time to see the heiress of the\r\nSmith estate standing like a statue, tin pan in hand, soup in her curls,\r\nher eyebrows and eyelashes,--collar, cuffs, and morning dress\r\nsaturated,--and Belle, at a little distance, looking at her and the soup\r\non the floor with surprise and disgust depicted on every feature. The\r\ntableau was inexpressibly comical, and I could not help laughing\r\noutright; whereupon Belle turned on me, and, with indignant tones, said,\r\n\"If you had been up since four o'clock making that soup you would not\r\nstand there like a laughing monkey, without the least feeling of pity!\"\r\nPoor Lizzie was very sorry, and would have shed tears, but they could\r\nnot penetrate that film of soup. I tried to apologize, but could only\r\nlaugh the more when I saw Belle crying and Lizzie standing as if hoping\r\nthat the soup might be scraped off her and gathered from the floor and\r\nmade to do duty on the occasion.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, ladies and gentlemen, alike in white aprons, crowded\r\ninto the dining room and kitchen, each to perform the allotted task.\r\nGeorge Biddle of Philadelphia and John B. Miller of Utica, in holiday\r\nspirits, were irrepressible--everywhere at the same moment, helping or\r\nhindering as the case might be. Dear Belle, having only partially\r\nrecovered from the white-soup catastrophe, called Mr. Biddle to hold the\r\nice-cream freezer while she poured in the luscious compound she had just\r\nprepared. He held it up without resting it on anything, while Belle\r\nslowly poured in the cream. As the freezer had no indentations round the\r\ntop or rim to brace the thumbs and fingers, when it grew suddenly\r\nheavier his hands slipped and down went the whole thing, spattering poor\r\nBelle and spoiling a beautiful pair of gaiters in which, as she had very\r\npretty feet, she took a laudable pride. In another corner sat Wealthea\r\nBackus, grating some cocoanut. While struggling in that operation, John\r\nMiller, feeling hilarious, was annoying her in divers ways; at length\r\nshe drew the grater across his nose, gently, as she intended, but alas!\r\nshe took the skin off, and John's beauty, for the remainder of the\r\nfestivities, was marred with a black patch on that prominent feature.\r\nOne can readily imagine the fun that must have transpired where so many\r\namateur cooks were at work round one table, with all manner of culinary\r\ntools and ingredients.\r\n\r\nAs assistant-at-large I was summoned to the cellar, where Mrs. Cornelia\r\nBarclay of New York was evolving from a pan of flour and water that\r\nmiracle in the pie department called puff paste. This, it seems, can\r\nonly be accomplished where the thermometer is below forty, and near a\r\nrefrigerator where the compound can be kept cold until ready to be\r\npopped into the oven. No jokes or nonsense here. With queenly dignity\r\nthe flour and water were gently compressed. Here one hand must not know\r\nwhat the other doeth. Bits of butter must be so deftly introduced that\r\neven the rolling pin may be unconscious of its work. As the artist gave\r\nthe last touch to an exquisite lemon pie, with a mingled expression of\r\npride and satisfaction on her classic features, she ordered me to bear\r\nit to the oven. In the transit I met Madam Belle. \"Don't let that fall,\"\r\nshe said sneeringly. Fortunately I did not, and returned in triumph to\r\ntransport another. I was then summoned to a consultation with the\r\ncommittee on toasts, consisting of James Cochrane, John Miller, and\r\nmyself. Mr. Miller had one for each guest already written, all of which\r\nwe accepted and pronounced very good.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, a most excellent dinner emerged from all this uproar and\r\nconfusion. The table, with its silver, china, flowers, and rich viands,\r\nthe guests in satins, velvets, jewels, soft laces, and bright cravats,\r\ntogether reflecting all the colors of the prism, looked as beautiful as\r\nthe rainbow after a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago I made my last sad visit to that spot so rich with\r\npleasant memories of bygone days. A few relatives and family friends\r\ngathered there to pay the last tokens of respect to our noble cousin.\r\nIt was on one of the coldest days of gray December that we laid him in\r\nthe frozen earth, to be seen no more. He died from a stroke of apoplexy\r\nin New York city, at the home of his niece, Mrs. Ellen Cochrane Walter,\r\nwhose mother was Mr. Smith's only sister. The journey from New York to\r\nPeterboro was cold and dreary, and climbing the hills from Canastota in\r\nan open sleigh, nine hundred feet above the valley, with the thermometer\r\nbelow zero, before sunrise, made all nature look as sombre as the sad\r\nerrand on which we came.\r\n\r\nOutside the mansion everything in its wintry garb was cold and still,\r\nand all within was silent as the grave. The central figure, the light\r\nand joy of that home, had vanished forever. He who had welcomed us on\r\nthat threshold for half a century would welcome us no more. We did what\r\nwe could to dissipate the gloom that settled on us all. We did not\r\nintensify our grief by darkening the house and covering ourselves with\r\nblack crape, but wore our accustomed dresses of chastened colors and\r\nopened all the blinds that the glad sunshine might stream in. We hung\r\nthe apartment where the casket stood with wreaths of evergreens, and\r\noverhead we wove his favorite mottoes in living letters, \"Equal rights\r\nfor all!\" \"Rescue Cuba now!\" The religious services were short and\r\nsimple; the Unitarian clergyman from Syracuse made a few remarks, the\r\nchildren from the orphan asylum, in which he was deeply interested, sang\r\nan appropriate hymn, and around the grave stood representatives of the\r\nBiddles, the Dixwells, the Sedgwicks, the Barclays, and Stantons, and\r\nthree generations of his immediate family. With a few appropriate words\r\nfrom General John Cochrane we left our beloved kinsman alone in his\r\nlast resting place. Two months later, on his birthday, his wife, Ann\r\nCarroll Fitzhugh, passed away and was laid by his side. Theirs was a\r\nremarkably happy union of over half a century, and they were soon\r\nreunited in the life eternal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nOUR WEDDING JOURNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy engagement was a season of doubt and conflict--doubt as to the wisdom\r\nof changing a girlhood of freedom and enjoyment for I knew not what, and\r\nconflict because the step I proposed was in opposition to the wishes of\r\nall my family. Whereas, heretofore, friends were continually suggesting\r\nsuitable matches for me and painting the marriage relation in the most\r\ndazzling colors, now that state was represented as beset with dangers\r\nand disappointments, and men, of all God's creatures as the most\r\ndepraved and unreliable. Hard pressed, I broke my engagement, after\r\nmonths of anxiety and bewilderment; suddenly I decided to renew it, as\r\nMr. Stanton was going to Europe as a delegate to the World's\r\nAnti-slavery Convention, and we did not wish the ocean to roll between\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThursday, May 10, 1840, I determined to take the fateful step, without\r\nthe slightest preparation for a wedding or a voyage; but Mr. Stanton,\r\ncoming up the North River, was detained on \"Marcy's Overslaugh,\" a bar\r\nin the river where boats were frequently stranded for hours. This delay\r\ncompelled us to be married on Friday, which is commonly supposed to be a\r\nmost unlucky day. But as we lived together, without more than the usual\r\nmatrimonial friction, for nearly a half a century, had seven children,\r\nall but one of whom are still living, and have been well sheltered,\r\nclothed, and fed, enjoying sound minds in sound bodies, no one need be\r\nafraid of going through the marriage ceremony on Friday for fear of bad\r\nluck. The Scotch clergyman who married us, being somewhat superstitious,\r\nbegged us to postpone it until Saturday; but, as we were to sail early\r\nin the coming week, that was impossible. That point settled, the next\r\ndifficulty was to persuade him to leave out the word \"obey\" in the\r\nmarriage ceremony. As I obstinately refused to obey one with whom I\r\nsupposed I was entering into an equal relation, that point, too, was\r\nconceded. A few friends were invited to be present and, in a simple\r\nwhite evening dress, I was married. But the good priest avenged himself\r\nfor the points he conceded, by keeping us on the rack with a long prayer\r\nand dissertation on the sacred institution for one mortal hour. The Rev.\r\nHugh Maire was a little stout fellow, vehement in manner and speech, who\r\ndanced about the floor, as he laid down the law, in the most original\r\nand comical manner. As Mr. Stanton had never seen him before, the hour\r\nto him was one of constant struggle to maintain his equilibrium. I had\r\nsat under his ministrations for several years, and was accustomed to his\r\nrhetoric, accent, and gestures, and thus was able to go through the\r\nordeal in a calmer state of mind.\r\n\r\nSister Madge, who had stood by me bravely through all my doubts and\r\nanxieties, went with us to New York and saw us on board the vessel. My\r\nsister Harriet and her husband, Daniel C. Eaton, a merchant in New York\r\ncity, were also there. He and I had had for years a standing game of\r\n\"tag\" at all our partings, and he had vowed to send me \"tagged\" to\r\nEurope. I was equally determined that he should not. Accordingly, I\r\nhad a desperate chase after him all over the vessel, but in vain. He had\r\nthe last \"tag\" and escaped. As I was compelled, under the circumstances,\r\nto conduct the pursuit with some degree of decorum, and he had the\r\nadvantage of height, long limbs, and freedom from skirts, I really stood\r\nno chance whatever. However, as the chase kept us all laughing, it\r\nhelped to soften the bitterness of parting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.B. Stanton] [Illustration: MRS. STANTON AND DAUGHTER,\r\n1857.]\r\n\r\nFairly at sea, I closed another chapter of my life, and my thoughts\r\nturned to what lay in the near future. James G. Birney, the anti-slavery\r\nnominee for the presidency of the United States, joined us in New York,\r\nand was a fellow-passenger on the Montreal for England. He and my\r\nhusband were delegates to the World's Anti-slavery Convention, and both\r\ninterested themselves in my anti-slavery education. They gave me books\r\nto read, and, as we paced the deck day by day, the question was the\r\nchief theme of our conversation.\r\n\r\nMr. Birney was a polished gentleman of the old school, and was\r\nexcessively proper and punctilious in manner and conversation. I soon\r\nperceived that he thought I needed considerable toning down before\r\nreaching England. I was quick to see and understand that his criticisms\r\nof others in a general way and the drift of his discourses on manners\r\nand conversation had a nearer application than he intended I should\r\ndiscover, though he hoped I would profit by them. I was always grateful\r\nto anyone who took an interest in my improvement, so I laughingly told\r\nhim, one day, that he need not make his criticisms any longer in that\r\nroundabout way, but might take me squarely in hand and polish me up as\r\nspeedily as possible. Sitting in the saloon at night after a game of\r\nchess, in which, perchance, I had been the victor, I felt complacent\r\nand would sometimes say:\r\n\r\n\"Well, what have I said or done to-day open to criticism?\"\r\n\r\nSo, in the most gracious manner, he replied on one occasion:\r\n\r\n\"You went to the masthead in a chair, which I think very unladylike. I\r\nheard you call your husband 'Henry' in the presence of strangers, which\r\nis not permissible in polite society. You should always say 'Mr.\r\nStanton.' You have taken three moves back in this game.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless me!\" I replied, \"what a catalogue in one day! I fear my Mentor\r\nwill despair of my ultimate perfection.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have more hope,\" he replied, \"if you seemed to feel my rebukes\r\nmore deeply, but you evidently think them of too little consequence to\r\nbe much disturbed by them.\"\r\n\r\nAs he found even more fault with my husband, we condoled with each other\r\nand decided that our friend was rather hypercritical and that we were as\r\nnearly perfect as mortals need be for the wear and tear of ordinary\r\nlife. Being both endowed with a good degree of self-esteem, neither the\r\npraise nor the blame of mankind was overpowering to either of us. As the\r\nvoyage lasted eighteen days--for we were on a sailing vessel--we had\r\ntime to make some improvement, or, at least, to consider all friendly\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nAt this time Mr. Birney was very much in love with Miss Fitzhugh of\r\nGeneseo, to whom he was afterward married. He suffered at times great\r\ndepression of spirits, but I could always rouse him to a sunny mood by\r\nintroducing her name. That was a theme of which he never grew weary,\r\nand, while praising her, a halo of glory was to him visible around my\r\nhead and I was faultless for the time being. There was nothing in our\r\nfellow-passengers to break the monotony of the voyage. They were all\r\nstolid, middle-class English people, returning from various parts of the\r\nworld to visit their native land.\r\n\r\nWhen out of their hearing, Mr. Birney used to ridicule them without\r\nmercy; so, one day, by way of making a point, I said with great\r\nsolemnity, \"Is it good breeding to make fun of the foibles of our\r\nfellow-men, who have not had our advantages of culture and education?\"\r\nHe felt the rebuke and blushed, and never again returned to that\r\nsubject. I am sorry to say I was glad to find him once in fault.\r\n\r\nThough some amusement, in whatever extraordinary way I could obtain it,\r\nwas necessary to my existence, yet, as it was deemed important that I\r\nshould thoroughly understand the status of the anti-slavery movement in\r\nmy own country, I spent most of my time reading and talking on that\r\nquestion. Being the wife of a delegate to the World's Convention, we all\r\nfelt it important that I should be able to answer whatever questions I\r\nmight be asked in England on all phases of the slavery question.\r\n\r\nThe captain, a jolly fellow, was always ready to second me in my\r\nexplorations into every nook and cranny of the vessel. He imagined that\r\nmy reading was distasteful and enforced by the older gentlemen, so he\r\nwas continually planning some diversion, and often invited me to sit\r\nwith him and listen to his experiences of a sailor's life.\r\n\r\nBut all things must end in this mortal life, and our voyage was near\r\nits termination, when we were becalmed on the Southern coast of England\r\nand could not make more than one knot an hour. When within sight of the\r\ndistant shore, a pilot boat came along and offered to take anyone ashore\r\nin six hours. I was so delighted at the thought of reaching land that,\r\nafter much persuasion, Mr. Stanton and Mr. Birney consented to go.\r\nAccordingly we were lowered into the boat in an armchair, with a\r\nluncheon consisting of a cold chicken, a loaf of bread, and a bottle of\r\nwine, with just enough wind to carry our light craft toward our\r\ndestination. But, instead of six hours, we were all day trying to reach\r\nthe land, and, as the twilight deepened and the last breeze died away,\r\nthe pilot said: \"We are now two miles from shore, but the only way you\r\ncan reach there to-night is by a rowboat.\"\r\n\r\nAs we had no provisions left and nowhere to sleep, we were glad to avail\r\nourselves of the rowboat. It was a bright moonlight night, the air\r\nbalmy, the waters smooth, and, with two stout oarsmen, we glided swiftly\r\nalong. As Mr. Birney made the last descent and seated himself, doubtful\r\nas to our reaching shore, turning to me he said: \"The woman tempted me\r\nand I did leave the good ship.\" However, we did reach the shore at\r\nmidnight and landed at Torquay, one of the loveliest spots in that\r\ncountry, and our journey to Exeter the next day lay through the most\r\nbeautiful scenery in England.\r\n\r\nAs we had no luggage with us, our detention by customs officers was\r\nbrief, and we were soon conducted to a comfortable little hotel, which\r\nwe found in the morning was a bower of roses. I had never imagined\r\nanything so beautiful as the drive up to Exeter on the top of a coach,\r\nwith four stout horses, trotting at the rate of ten miles an hour. It\r\nwas the first day of June, and the country was in all its glory. The\r\nfoliage was of the softest green, the trees were covered with blossoms,\r\nand the shrubs with flowers. The roads were perfect; the large,\r\nfine-looking coachman, with his white gloves and reins, his rosy face\r\nand lofty bearing and the postman in red, blowing his horn as we passed\r\nthrough every village, made the drive seem like a journey in fairyland.\r\nWe had heard that England was like a garden of flowers, but we were\r\nwholly unprepared for such wealth of beauty.\r\n\r\nIn Exeter we had our first view of one of the great cathedrals in the\r\nOld World, and we were all deeply impressed with its grandeur. It was\r\njust at the twilight hour, when the last rays of the setting sun,\r\nstreaming through the stained glass windows, deepened the shadows and\r\nthrew a mysterious amber light over all. As the choir was practicing,\r\nthe whole effect was heightened by the deep tones of the organ\r\nreverberating through the arched roof, and the sound of human voices as\r\nif vainly trying to fill the vast space above. The novelty and solemnity\r\nof the surroundings roused all our religious emotions and thrilled every\r\nnerve in our being. As if moved by the same impulse to linger there a\r\nwhile, we all sat down, silently waiting for something to break the\r\nspell that bound us. Can one wonder at the power of the Catholic\r\nreligion for centuries, with such accessories to stimulate the\r\nimagination to a blind worship of the unknown?\r\n\r\nSitting in the hotel that evening and wanting something to read, we\r\nasked the waiter for the daily papers. As there was no public table or\r\ndrawing room for guests, but each party had its own apartment, we needed\r\na little change from the society of each other. Having been, as it were,\r\nshut from the outside world for eighteen days, we had some curiosity to\r\nsee whether our planet was still revolving from west to east. At the\r\nmention of papers in the plural number, the attendant gave us a look of\r\nsurprise, and said he would get \"it.\" He returned saying that the\r\ngentleman in No. 4 had \"it,\" but he would be through in fifteen minutes.\r\nAccordingly, at the end of that time, he brought the newspaper, and,\r\nafter we had had it the same length of time, he came to take it to\r\nanother party. At our lodging house in London, a paper was left for half\r\nan hour each morning, and then it was taken to the next house, thus\r\nserving several families of readers.\r\n\r\nThe next day brought us to London. When I first entered our lodging\r\nhouse in Queen Street, I thought it the gloomiest abode I had ever seen.\r\nThe arrival of a delegation of ladies, the next day, from Boston and\r\nPhiladelphia, changed the atmosphere of the establishment, and filled me\r\nwith delightful anticipations of some new and charming acquaintances,\r\nwhich I fully realized in meeting Emily Winslow, Abby Southwick,\r\nElizabeth Neal, Mary Grew, Abby Kimber, Sarah Pugh, and Lucretia Mott.\r\nThere had been a split in the American anti-slavery ranks, and delegates\r\ncame from both branches, and, as they were equally represented at our\r\nlodgings, I became familiar with the whole controversy. The potent\r\nelement which caused the division was the woman question, and as the\r\nGarrisonian branch maintained the right of women to speak and vote in\r\nthe conventions, all my sympathies were with the Garrisonians, though\r\nMr. Stanton and Mr. Birney belonged to the other branch, called\r\npolitical abolitionists. To me there was no question so important as the\r\nemancipation of women from the dogmas of the past, political, religious,\r\nand social. It struck me as very remarkable that abolitionists, who felt\r\nso keenly the wrongs of the slave, should be so oblivious to the equal\r\nwrongs of their own mothers, wives, and sisters, when, according to the\r\ncommon law, both classes occupied a similar legal status.\r\n\r\nOur chief object in visiting England at this time was to attend the\r\nWorld's Anti-slavery Convention, to meet June 12, 1840, in Freemasons'\r\nHall, London. Delegates from all the anti-slavery societies of civilized\r\nnations were invited, yet, when they arrived, those representing\r\nassociations of women were rejected. Though women were members of the\r\nNational Anti-slavery Society, accustomed to speak and vote in all its\r\nconventions, and to take an equally active part with men in the whole\r\nanti-slavery struggle, and were there as delegates from associations of\r\nmen and women, as well as those distinctively of their own sex, yet all\r\nalike were rejected because they were women. Women, according to English\r\nprejudices at that time, were excluded by Scriptural texts from sharing\r\nequal dignity and authority with men in all reform associations; hence\r\nit was to English minds pre-eminently unfitting that women should be\r\nadmitted as equal members to a World's Convention. The question was\r\nhotly debated through an entire day. My husband made a very eloquent\r\nspeech in favor of admitting the women delegates.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that Lady Byron, Anna Jameson, Mary Howitt, Mrs. Hugo\r\nReid, Elizabeth Fry, Amelia Opie, Ann Green Phillips, Lucretia Mott, and\r\nmany remarkable women, speakers and leaders in the Society of Friends,\r\nwere all compelled to listen in silence to the masculine platitudes on\r\nwoman's sphere, one may form some idea of the indignation of\r\nunprejudiced friends, and especially that of such women as Lydia Maria\r\nChild, Maria Chapman, Deborah Weston, Angelina and Sarah Grimké, and\r\nAbby Kelly, who were impatiently waiting and watching on this side, in\r\npainful suspense, to hear how their delegates were received. Judging\r\nfrom my own feelings, the women on both sides of the Atlantic must have\r\nbeen humiliated and chagrined, except as these feelings were outweighed\r\nby contempt for the shallow reasoning of their opponents and their\r\ncomical pose and gestures in some of the intensely earnest flights of\r\ntheir imagination.\r\n\r\nThe clerical portion of the convention was most violent in its\r\nopposition. The clergymen seemed to have God and his angels especially\r\nin their care and keeping, and were in agony lest the women should do or\r\nsay something to shock the heavenly hosts. Their all-sustaining conceit\r\ngave them abundant assurance that their movements must necessarily be\r\nall-pleasing to the celestials whose ears were open to the proceedings\r\nof the World's Convention. Deborah, Huldah, Vashti, and Esther might\r\nhave questioned the propriety of calling it a World's Convention, when\r\nonly half of humanity was represented there; but what were their\r\nopinions worth compared with those of the Rev. A. Harvey, the Rev. C.\r\nStout, or the Rev. J. Burnet, who, Bible in hand, argued woman's\r\nsubjection, divinely decreed when Eve was created.\r\n\r\nOne of our champions in the convention, George Bradburn, a tall\r\nthick-set man with a voice like thunder, standing head and shoulders\r\nabove the clerical representatives, swept all their arguments aside by\r\ndeclaring with tremendous emphasis that, if they could prove to him that\r\nthe Bible taught the entire subjection of one-half of the race to the\r\nother, he should consider that the best thing he could do for humanity\r\nwould be to bring together every Bible in the universe and make a grand\r\nbonfire of them.\r\n\r\nIt was really pitiful to hear narrow-minded bigots, pretending to be\r\nteachers and leaders of men, so cruelly remanding their own mothers,\r\nwith the rest of womankind, to absolute subjection to the ordinary\r\nmasculine type of humanity. I always regretted that the women themselves\r\nhad not taken part in the debate before the convention was fully\r\norganized and the question of delegates settled. It seemed to me then,\r\nand does now, that all delegates with credentials from recognized\r\nsocieties should have had a voice in the organization of the convention,\r\nthough subject to exclusion afterward. However, the women sat in a low\r\ncurtained seat like a church choir, and modestly listened to the French,\r\nBritish, and American Solons for twelve of the longest days in June, as\r\ndid, also, our grand Garrison and Rogers in the gallery. They scorned a\r\nconvention that ignored the rights of the very women who had fought,\r\nside by side, with them in the anti-slavery conflict. \"After battling so\r\nmany long years,\" said Garrison, \"for the liberties of African slaves, I\r\ncan take no part in a convention that strikes down the most sacred\r\nrights of all women.\" After coming three thousand miles to speak on the\r\nsubject nearest his heart, he nobly shared the enforced silence of the\r\nrejected delegates. It was a great act of self-sacrifice that should\r\nnever be forgotten by women.\r\n\r\nThomas Clarkson was chosen president of the convention and made a few\r\nremarks in opening, but he soon retired, as his age and many infirmities\r\nmade all public occasions too burdensome, and Joseph Sturge, a Quaker,\r\nwas made chairman. Sitting next to Mrs. Mott, I said:\r\n\r\n\"As there is a Quaker in the chair now, what could he do if the spirit\r\nshould move you to speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" she replied, evidently not believing such a contingency possible,\r\n\"where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\"\r\n\r\nShe had not much faith in the sincerity of abolitionists who, while\r\neloquently defending the natural rights of slaves, denied freedom of\r\nspeech to one-half the people of their own race. Such was the\r\nconsistency of an assemblage of philanthropists! They would have been\r\nhorrified at the idea of burning the flesh of the distinguished women\r\npresent with red-hot irons, but the crucifixion of their pride and\r\nself-respect, the humiliation of the spirit, seemed to them a most\r\ntrifling matter. The action of this convention was the topic of\r\ndiscussion, in public and private, for a long time, and stung many women\r\ninto new thought and action and gave rise to the movement for women's\r\npolitical equality both in England and the United States.\r\n\r\nAs the convention adjourned, the remark was heard on all sides, \"It is\r\nabout time some demand was made for new liberties for women.\" As Mrs.\r\nMott and I walked home, arm in arm, commenting on the incidents of the\r\nday, we resolved to hold a convention as soon as we returned home, and\r\nform a society to advocate the rights of women. At the lodging house on\r\nQueen Street, where a large number of delegates had apartments, the\r\ndiscussions were heated at every meal, and at times so bitter that, at\r\nlast, Mr. Birney packed his valise and sought more peaceful quarters.\r\nHaving strongly opposed the admission of women as delegates to the\r\nconvention it was rather embarrassing to meet them, during the intervals\r\nbetween the various sessions, at the table and in the drawing room.\r\n\r\nThese were the first women I had ever met who believed in the equality\r\nof the sexes and who did not believe in the popular orthodox religion.\r\nThe acquaintance of Lucretia Mott, who was a broad, liberal thinker on\r\npolitics, religion, and all questions of reform, opened to me a new\r\nworld of thought. As we walked about to see the sights of London, I\r\nembraced every opportunity to talk with her. It was intensely gratifying\r\nto hear all that, through years of doubt, I had dimly thought, so freely\r\ndiscussed by other women, some of them no older than myself--women, too,\r\nof rare intelligence, cultivation, and refinement. After six weeks'\r\nsojourn under the same roof with Lucretia Mott, whose conversation was\r\nuniformly on a high plane, I felt that I knew her too well to sympathize\r\nwith the orthodox Friends, who denounced her as a dangerous woman\r\nbecause she doubted certain dogmas they fully believed.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Birney and my husband were invited to speak all over England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland, and we were uniformly entertained by orthodox\r\nFriends, I had abundant opportunity to know the general feeling among\r\nthem toward Lucretia Mott. Even Elizabeth Fry seemed quite unwilling to\r\nbreathe the same atmosphere with her. During the six weeks that many of\r\nus remained in London after the convention we were invited to a\r\nsuccession of public and private breakfasts, dinners, and teas, and on\r\nthese occasions it was amusing to watch Mrs. Fry's sedulous efforts to\r\nkeep Mrs. Mott at a distance. If Mrs. Mott was on the lawn, Mrs. Fry\r\nwould go into the house; if Mrs. Mott was in the house, Mrs. Fry would\r\nstay out on the lawn. One evening, when we were all crowded into two\r\nparlors, and there was no escape, the word went round that Mrs. Fry felt\r\nmoved to pray with the American delegates, whereupon a profound silence\r\nreigned. After a few moments Mrs. Fry's voice was heard deploring the\r\nschism among the American Friends; that sol many had been led astray by\r\nfalse doctrines; urging the Spirit of All Good to show them the error of\r\ntheir way, and gather them once more into the fold of the great Shepherd\r\nof our faith. The prayer was directed so pointedly at the followers of\r\nElias Hicks, and at Lucretia Mott in particular, that I whispered to\r\nLucretia, at the close, that she should now pray for Mrs. Fry, that her\r\neyes might be opened to her bigotry and uncharitableness, and be led by\r\nthe Spirit into higher light. \"Oh, no!\" she replied, \"a prayer of this\r\ncharacter, under the circumstances, is an unfair advantage to take of a\r\nstranger, but I would not resent it in the house of her friends.\"\r\n\r\nIn these gatherings we met the leading Quaker families and many other\r\nphilanthropists of different denominations interested in the\r\nanti-slavery movement. On all these occasions our noble Garrison spoke\r\nmost effectively, and thus our English friends had an opportunity of\r\nenjoying his eloquence, the lack of which had been so grave a loss in\r\nthe convention.\r\n\r\nWe devoted a month sedulously to sightseeing in London, and, in the line\r\nof the traveler's duty, we explored St. Paul's Cathedral, the British\r\nMuseum, the Tower, various prisons, hospitals, galleries of art, Windsor\r\nCastle, and St. James's Palace, the Zoological Gardens, the schools and\r\ncolleges, the chief theaters and churches, Westminster Abbey, the Houses\r\nof Parliament, and the Courts. We heard the most famous preachers,\r\nactors, and statesmen. In fact, we went to the top and bottom of\r\neverything, from the dome of St. Paul to the tunnel under the Thames,\r\njust then in the process of excavation. We drove through the parks,\r\nsailed up and down the Thames, and then visited every shire but four in\r\nEngland, in all of which we had large meetings, Mr. Birney and Mr.\r\nStanton being the chief speakers. As we were generally invited to stay\r\nwith Friends, it gave us a good opportunity to see the leading families,\r\nsuch as the Ashursts, the Alexanders, the Priestmans, the Braithwaites,\r\nand Buxtons, the Gurneys, the Peases, the Wighams of Edinburgh, and the\r\nWebbs of Dublin. We spent a few days with John Joseph Gurney at his\r\nbeautiful home in Norwich. He had just returned from America, having\r\nmade a tour through the South. When asked how he liked America, he said,\r\n\"I like everything but your pie crust and your slavery.\"\r\n\r\nBefore leaving London, the whole American delegation, about forty in\r\nnumber, were invited to dine with Samuel Gurney. He and his brother,\r\nJohn Joseph Gurney, were, at that time, the leading bankers in London.\r\nSomeone facetiously remarked that the Jews were the leading bankers in\r\nLondon until the Quakers crowded them out.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking women I met in England at this time was Miss\r\nElizabeth Pease. I never saw a more strongly marked face. Meeting her,\r\nforty years after, on the platform of a great meeting in the Town Hall\r\nat Glasgow, I knew her at once. She is now Mrs. Nichol of Edinburgh,\r\nand, though on the shady side of eighty, is still active in all the\r\nreforms of the day.\r\n\r\nIt surprised us very much at first, when driving into the grounds of\r\nsome of these beautiful Quaker homes, to have the great bell rung at the\r\nlodge, and to see the number of liveried servants on the porch and in\r\nthe halls, and then to meet the host in plain garb, and to be welcomed\r\nin plain language, \"How does thee do, Henry?\" \"How does thee do\r\nElizabeth?\" This sounded peculiarly sweet to me--a stranger in a strange\r\nland. The wealthy English Quakers we visited at that time, taking them\r\nall in all, were the most charming people I had ever seen. They were\r\nrefined and intelligent on all subjects, and though rather conservative\r\non some points, were not aggressive in pressing their opinions on\r\nothers. Their hospitality was charming and generous, their homes the\r\nbeau ideal of comfort and order, the cuisine faultless, while peace\r\nreigned over all. The quiet, gentle manner and the soft tones in\r\nspeaking, and the mysterious quiet in these well-ordered homes were like\r\nthe atmosphere one finds in a modern convent, where the ordinary duties\r\nof the day seem to be accomplished by some magical influence.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving London we spent a delightful day in June at the home of\r\nSamuel Gurney, surrounded by a fine park with six hundred deer roaming\r\nabout--always a beautiful feature in the English landscape. As the\r\nDuchess of Sutherland and Lord Morpeth had expressed a wish to Mrs. Fry\r\nto meet some of the leading American abolitionists, it was arranged that\r\nthey should call at her brother's residence on this occasion. Soon after\r\nwe arrived, the Duchess, with her brother and Mrs. Fry, in her state\r\ncarriage with six horses and outriders, drove up to the door. Mr. Gurney\r\nwas evidently embarrassed at the prospect of a lord and a duchess under\r\nhis roof. Leaning on the arm of Mrs. Fry, the duchess was formally\r\nintroduced to us individually. Mrs. Mott conversed with the\r\ndistinguished guests with the same fluency and composure as with her own\r\ncountrywomen. However anxious the English people were as to what they\r\nshould say and do, the Americans were all quite at their ease.\r\n\r\nAs Lord Morpeth had some interesting letters from the island of Jamaica\r\nto read to us, we formed a circle on the lawn to listen. England had\r\njust paid one hundred millions of dollars to emancipate the slaves, and\r\nwe were all interested in hearing the result of the experiment. The\r\ndistinguished guest in turn had many questions to ask in regard to\r\nAmerican slavery. We found none of that prejudice against color in\r\nEngland which is so inveterate among the American people; at my first\r\ndinner in England I found myself beside a gentleman from Jamaica, as\r\nblack as the ace of spades. After the departure of the duchess, dinner\r\nwas announced. It was a sumptuous meal, most tastefully served. There\r\nwere half a dozen wineglasses at every plate, but abolitionists, in\r\nthose days, were all converts to temperance, and, as the bottles went\r\naround there was a general headshaking, and the right hand extended\r\nover the glasses. Our English friends were amazed that none of us drank\r\nwine. Mr. Gurney said he had never before seen such a sight as forty\r\nladies and gentlemen sitting down to dinner and none of them tasting\r\nwine. In talking with him on that point, he said:\r\n\r\n\"I suppose your nursing mothers drink beer?\"\r\n\r\nI laughed, and said, \"Oh, no! We should be afraid of befogging the\r\nbrains of our children.\"\r\n\r\n\"No danger of that,\" said he; \"we are all bright enough, and yet a cask\r\nof beer is rolled into the cellar for the mother with each newborn\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Miller from Vermont, one of our American delegation, was in the\r\nGreek war with Lord Byron. As Lady Byron had expressed a wish to see\r\nhim, that her daughter might know something of her father's last days,\r\nan interview was arranged, and the colonel kindly invited me to\r\naccompany him. His account of their acquaintance and the many noble\r\ntraits of character Lord Byron manifested, his generous impulses and\r\nacts of self-sacrifice, seemed particularly gratifying to the daughter.\r\nIt was a sad interview, arranged chiefly for the daughter's\r\nsatisfaction, though Lady Byron listened with a painful interest. As the\r\ncolonel was a warm admirer of the great poet, he no doubt represented\r\nhim in the best possible light, and his narration of his last days was\r\ndeeply interesting. Lady Byron had a quiet, reserved manner, a sad face,\r\nand a low, plaintive voice, like one who had known deep sorrow. I had\r\nseen her frequently in the convention and at social teas, and had been\r\npersonally presented to her before this occasion. Altogether I thought\r\nher a sweet, attractive-looking woman.\r\n\r\nWe had a pleasant interview with Lord Brougham also. The Philadelphia\r\nAnti-slavery Society sent him an elaborately carved inkstand, made from\r\nthe wood of Pennsylvania Hall, which was destroyed by a pro-slavery mob.\r\nMr. Birney made a most graceful speech in presenting the memento, and\r\nLord Brougham was equally happy in receiving it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable characters we met at this time was Daniel\r\nO'Connell. He made his first appearance in the London convention a few\r\ndays after the women were rejected. He paid a beautiful tribute to woman\r\nand said that, if he had been present when the question was under\r\ndiscussion, he should have spoken and voted for their admission. He was\r\na tall, well-developed, magnificent-looking man, and probably one of the\r\nmost effective speakers Ireland ever produced. I saw him at a great\r\nIndia meeting in Exeter Hall, where some of the best orators from\r\nFrance, America, and England were present. There were six natives from\r\nIndia on the platform who, not understanding anything that was said,\r\nnaturally remained listless throughout the proceedings. But the moment\r\nO'Connell began to speak they were all attention, bending forward and\r\nclosely watching every movement. One could almost tell what he said from\r\nthe play of his expressive features, his wonderful gestures, and the\r\npose of his whole body. When he finished, the natives joined in the\r\ngeneral applause. He had all Wendell Phillips' power of sarcasm and\r\ndenunciation, and added to that the most tender pathos. He could make\r\nhis audience laugh or cry at pleasure. It was a rare sight to see him\r\ndressed in \"Repeal cloth\" in one of his Repeal meetings. We were in\r\nDublin in the midst of that excitement, when the hopes of new liberties\r\nfor that oppressed people all centered on O'Connell. The enthusiasm of\r\nthe people for the Repeal of the Union was then at white-heat. Dining\r\none day with the \"Great Liberator,\" as he was called, I asked him if he\r\nhoped to carry that measure.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, \"but it is always good policy to claim the uttermost and\r\nthen you will be sure to get something.\"\r\n\r\nCould he have looked forward fifty years and have seen the present\r\ncondition of his unhappy country, he would have known that English greed\r\nand selfishness could defeat any policy, however wise and far-seeing.\r\nThe successive steps by which Irish commerce was ruined and religious\r\nfeuds between her people continually fanned into life, and the nation\r\nsubjugated, form the darkest page in the history of England. But the\r\npeople are awakening at last to their duty, and, for the first time,\r\norganizing English public sentiment in favor of \"Home Rule.\" I attended\r\nseveral large, enthusiastic meetings when last in England, in which the\r\nmost radical utterances of Irish patriots were received with prolonged\r\ncheers. I trust the day is not far off when the beautiful Emerald Isle\r\nwill unfurl her banner before the nations of the earth, enthroned as the\r\nQueen Republic of those northern seas!\r\n\r\nWe visited Wordsworth's home at Grasmere, among the beautiful lakes, but\r\nhe was not there. However, we saw his surroundings--the landscape that\r\ninspired some of his poetic dreams, and the dense rows of hollyhocks of\r\nevery shade and color, leading from his porch to the gate. The gardener\r\ntold us this was his favorite flower. Though it had no special beauty in\r\nitself, taken alone, yet the wonderful combination of royal colors was\r\nindeed striking and beautiful. We saw Harriet Martineau at her country\r\nhome as well as at her house in town. As we were obliged to converse\r\nwith her through an ear trumpet, we left her to do most of the talking.\r\nShe gave us many amusing experiences of her travels in America, and her\r\ncomments on the London Convention were rich and racy. She was not an\r\nattractive woman in either manner or appearance, though considered great\r\nand good by all who knew her.\r\n\r\nWe spent a few days with Thomas Clarkson, in Ipswich. He lived in a very\r\nold house with long rambling corridors, surrounded by a moat, which we\r\ncrossed' by means of a drawbridge. He had just written an article\r\nagainst the colonization scheme, which his wife read aloud to us. He was\r\nso absorbed in the subject that he forgot the article was written by\r\nhimself, and kept up a running applause with \"hear!\" \"hear!\" the English\r\nmode of expressing approbation. He told us of the severe struggles he\r\nand Wilberforce had gone through in rousing the public sentiment of\r\nEngland to the demand for emancipation in Jamaica. But their trials were\r\nmild, compared with what Garrison and his coadjutors had suffered in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nHaving read of all these people, it was difficult to realize, as I\r\nvisited them in their own homes from day to day, that they were the same\r\npersons I had so long worshiped from afar!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nHOMEWARD BOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter taking a view of the wonders and surroundings of London we spent a\r\nmonth in Paris. Fifty years ago there was a greater difference in the\r\ngeneral appearance of things between France and England than now. That\r\ncountries only a few hours' journey apart should differ so widely was to\r\nus a great surprise. How changed the sights and sounds! Here was the old\r\ndiligence, lumbering along with its various compartments and its\r\nindefinite number of horses, harnessed with rope and leather, sometimes\r\ntwo, sometimes three abreast, and sometimes one in advance, with an\r\noutrider belaboring the poor beasts without cessation, and the driver\r\nyelling and cracking his whip. The uproar, confusion, and squabbles at\r\nevery stopping place are overwhelming; the upper classes, men and women\r\nalike, rushing into each other's arms, embrace and kiss, while drivers\r\nand hostlers on the slightest provocation hurl at each other all the\r\ndenunciatory adjectives in the language, and with such vehemence that\r\nyou expect every moment to see a deadly conflict. But to-day, as fifty\r\nyears ago, they never arrive at that point. Theirs was and is purely an\r\nencounter of words, which they keep up, as they drive off in opposite\r\ndirections, just as far as they can hear and see each other, with\r\nthreats of vengeance to come. Such an encounter between two Englishmen\r\nwould mean the death of one or the other.\r\n\r\nAll this was in marked contrast with John Bull and his Island. There the\r\npeople were as silent as if they had been born deaf and dumb. The\r\nEnglish stagecoach was compact, clean, and polished from top to bottom,\r\nthe horses and harness glossy and in order, the well-dressed, dignified\r\ncoachman, who seldom spoke a loud word or used his whip, kept his seat\r\nat the various stages, while hostlers watered or changed the steeds; the\r\npostman blew his bugle blast to have the mail in readiness, and the\r\nreserved passengers made no remarks on what was passing; for, in those\r\ndays, Englishmen were afraid to speak to each other for fear of\r\nrecognizing one not of their class, while to strangers and foreigners\r\nthey would not speak except in case of dire necessity. The Frenchman was\r\nready enough to talk, but, unfortunately, we were separated by different\r\nlanguages. Thus the Englishman would not talk, the Frenchman could not,\r\nand the intelligent, loquacious American driver, who discourses on\r\npolitics, religion, national institutions, and social gossip was unknown\r\non that side of the Atlantic. What the curious American traveler could\r\nfind out himself from observation and pertinacious seeking he was\r\nwelcome to, but the Briton would waste no breath to enlighten Yankees as\r\nto the points of interest or customs of his country.\r\n\r\nOur party consisted of Miss Pugh, Abby Kimber, Mr. Stanton, and myself.\r\nI had many amusing experiences in making my wants known when alone,\r\nhaving forgotten most of my French. For instance, traveling night and\r\nday in the diligence to Paris, as the stops were short, one was\r\nsometimes in need of something to eat. One night as my companions were\r\nall asleep, I went out to get a piece of cake or a cracker, or whatever\r\nof that sort I could obtain, but, owing to my clumsy use of the\r\nlanguage, I was misunderstood. Just as the diligence was about to start,\r\nand the shout for us to get aboard was heard, the waiter came running\r\nwith a piping hot plate of sweetbreads nicely broiled. I had waited and\r\nwondered why it took so long to get a simple piece of cake or biscuit,\r\nand lo! a piece of hot meat was offered me. I could not take the\r\nfrizzling thing in my hand nor eat it without bread, knife, or fork, so\r\nI hurried off to the coach, the man pursuing me to the very door. I was\r\nvexed and disappointed, while the rest of the party were convulsed with\r\nlaughter at the parting salute and my attempt to make my way alone. It\r\nwas some time before I heard the last of the \"sweetbreads.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Paris we secured a courier who could speak English, to\r\nshow us the sights of that wonderful city. Every morning early he was at\r\nthe door, rain or shine, to carry out our plans, which, with the aid of\r\nour guidebook, we had made the evening before. In this way, going\r\nsteadily, day after day, we visited all points of interest for miles\r\nround and sailed up and down the Seine. The Palace of the Tuileries,\r\nwith its many associations with a long line of more or less unhappy\r\nkings and queens, was then in its glory, and its extensive and beautiful\r\ngrounds were always gay with crowds of happy people. These gardens were\r\na great resort for nurses and children and were furnished with all\r\nmanner of novel appliances for their amusement, including beautiful\r\nlittle carriages drawn by four goats with girls or boys driving, boats\r\nsailing in the air, seemingly propelled by oars, and hobby horses\r\nflying round on whirligigs with boys vainly trying to catch each other.\r\nNo people have ever taken the trouble to invent so many amusements for\r\nchildren as have the French. The people enjoyed being always in the open\r\nair, night and day. The parks are crowded with amusement seekers, some\r\nreading and playing games, some sewing, knitting, playing on musical\r\ninstruments, dancing, sitting around tables in bevies eating, drinking,\r\nand gayly chatting. And yet, when they drive in carriages or go to their\r\nhomes at night, they will shut themselves in as tight as oysters in\r\ntheir shells. They have a theory that night air is very injurious,--in\r\nthe house,--although they will sit outside until midnight. I found this\r\nsame superstition prevalent in France fifty years later.\r\n\r\nWe visited the Hôtel des Invalides just as they were preparing the\r\nsarcophagus for the reception of the remains of Napoleon. We witnessed\r\nthe wild excitement of that enthusiastic people, and listened with deep\r\ninterest to the old soldiers' praises of their great general. The ladies\r\nof our party chatted freely with them. They all had interesting\r\nanecdotes to relate of their chief. They said he seldom slept over four\r\nhours, was an abstemious eater, and rarely changed a servant, as he\r\nhated a strange face about him. He was very fond of a game of chess, and\r\nsnuffed continuously; talked but little, was a light sleeper,--the\r\nstirring of a mouse would awaken him,--and always on the watch-tower.\r\nThey said that, in his great campaigns, he seemed to be omnipresent. A\r\nsentinel asleep at his post would sometimes waken to find Napoleon on\r\nduty in his place.\r\n\r\nThe ship that brought back Napoleon's remains was the _Belle Poule_\r\n(the beautiful hen!), which landed at Cherbourg, November 30, 1840. The\r\nbody was conveyed to the Church of the Invalides, which adjoins the\r\ntomb. The Prince de Joinville brought the body from Saint Helena, and\r\nLouis Philippe received it.\r\n\r\nAt that time each soldier had a little patch of land to decorate as he\r\npleased, in which many scenes from their great battles were illustrated.\r\nOne represented Napoleon crossing the Alps. There were the cannon, the\r\nsoldiers, Napoleon on horseback, all toiling up the steep ascent,\r\nperfect in miniature. In another was Napoleon, flag in hand, leading the\r\ncharge across the bridge of Lodi. In still another was Napoleon in\r\nEgypt, before the Pyramids, seated, impassive, on his horse, gazing at\r\nthe Sphinx, as if about to utter his immortal words to his soldiers:\r\n\"Here, forty centuries look down upon us.\" These object lessons of the\r\npast are all gone now and the land used for more prosaic purposes.\r\n\r\nI little thought, as I witnessed that great event in France in 1840,\r\nthat fifty-seven years later I should witness a similar pageant in the\r\nAmerican Republic, when our nation paid its last tributes to General\r\nGrant. There are many points of similarity in these great events. As men\r\nthey were alike aggressive and self-reliant. In Napoleon's will he\r\nexpressed the wish that his last resting place might be in the land and\r\namong the people he loved so well. His desire is fulfilled. He rests in\r\nthe chief city of the French republic, whose shores are washed by the\r\nwaters of the Seine. General Grant expressed the wish that he might be\r\ninterred in our metropolis and added: \"Wherever I am buried, I desire\r\nthat there shall be room for my wife by my side.\" His wishes, too, are\r\nfulfilled. He rests in the chief city of the American Republic, whose\r\nshores are washed by the waters of the Hudson, and in his magnificent\r\nmausoleum there is room for his wife by his side.\r\n\r\nSeveral members of the Society of Friends from Boston and Philadelphia,\r\nwho had attended the World's Anti-slavery Convention in London, joined\r\nour party for a trip on the Continent. Though opposed to war, they all\r\ntook a deep interest in the national excitement and in the pageants that\r\nheralded the expected arrival of the hero from Saint Helena. As they all\r\nwore military coats of the time of George Fox, the soldiers, supposing\r\nthey belonged to the army of some country, gave them the military salute\r\nwherever we went, much to their annoyance and our amusement.\r\n\r\nIn going the rounds, Miss Pugh amused us by reading aloud the\r\ndescription of what we were admiring and the historical events connected\r\nwith that particular building or locality. We urged her to spend the\r\ntime taking in all she could see and to read up afterward; but no, a\r\nhistory of France and Galignani's guide she carried everywhere, and,\r\nwhile the rest of us looked until we were fully satisfied, she took a\r\nbird's-eye view and read the description. Dear little woman! She was a\r\nfine scholar, a good historian, was well informed on all subjects and\r\ncountries, proved an invaluable traveling companion, and could tell more\r\nof what we saw than all the rest of us together.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions we chanced to meet Louis Philippe dashing by in an\r\nopen barouche. We felt great satisfaction in remembering that at one\r\ntime he was an exile in our country, where he earned his living by\r\nteaching school. What an honor for Yankee children to have been taught,\r\nby a French king, the rudiments of his language.\r\n\r\nHaving been accustomed to the Puritan Sunday of restraint and solemnity,\r\nI found that day in Paris gay and charming. The first time I entered\r\ninto some of the festivities, I really expected to be struck by\r\nlightning. The libraries, art galleries, concert halls, and theaters\r\nwere all open to the people. Bands of music were playing in the parks,\r\nwhere whole families, with their luncheons, spent the day--husbands,\r\nwives, and children, on an excursion together. The boats on the Seine\r\nand all public conveyances were crowded. Those who had but this one day\r\nfor pleasure seemed determined to make the most of it. A wonderful\r\ncontrast with that gloomy day in London, where all places of amusement\r\nwere closed and nothing open to the people but the churches and drinking\r\nsaloons. The streets and houses in which Voltaire, La Fayette, Mme. de\r\nStaël, Mme. Roland, Charlotte Corday, and other famous men and women\r\nlived and died, were pointed out to us. We little thought, then, of all\r\nthe terrible scenes to be enacted in Paris, nor that France would emerge\r\nfrom the dangers that beset her on every side into a sister republic. It\r\nhas been a wonderful achievement, with kings and Popes all plotting\r\nagainst her experiment, that she has succeeded in putting kingcraft\r\nunder her feet and proclaimed liberty, equality, fraternity for her\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks in France, we returned to London, traveling through\r\nEngland, Ireland, and Scotland for several months. We visited the scenes\r\nthat Shakespeare, Burns, and Dickens had made classic. We spent a few\r\ndays at Huntingdon, the home of Oliver Cromwell, and visited the estate\r\nwhere he passed his early married life. While there, one of his great\r\nadmirers read aloud to us a splendid article in one of the reviews,\r\nwritten by Carlyle, giving \"The Protector,\" as his friend said, his true\r\nplace in history. It was long the fashion of England's historians to\r\nrepresent Cromwell as a fanatic and hypocrite, but his character was\r\nvindicated by later writers. \"Never,\" says Macaulay, \"was a ruler so\r\nconspicuously born for sovereignty. The cup which has intoxicated almost\r\nall others sobered him.\"\r\n\r\nWe saw the picturesque ruins of Kenilworth Castle, the birthplace of\r\nShakespeare, the homes of Byron and Mary Chaworth, wandered through\r\nNewstead Abbey, saw the monument to the faithful dog, and the large\r\ndining room where Byron and his boon companions used to shoot at a mark.\r\nIt was a desolate region. We stopped a day or two at Ayr and drove out\r\nto the birthplace of Burns. The old house that had sheltered him was\r\nstill there, but its walls now echoed to other voices, and the fields\r\nwhere he had toiled were plowed by other hands. We saw the stream and\r\nbanks where he and Mary sat together, the old stone church where the\r\nwitches held their midnight revels, the two dogs, and the bridge of Ayr.\r\nWith Burns, as with Sappho, it was love that awoke his heart to song. A\r\nbonny lass who worked with him in the harvest field inspired his first\r\nattempts at rhyme. Life, with Burns, was one long, hard struggle. With\r\nhis natural love for the beautiful, the terrible depression of spirits\r\nhe suffered from his dreary surroundings was inevitable. The interest\r\ngreat men took in him, when they awoke to his genius, came too late for\r\nhis safety and encouragement. In a glass of whisky he found, at last,\r\nthe rest and cheer he never knew when sober. Poverty and ignorance are\r\nthe parents of intemperance, and that vice will never be suppressed\r\nuntil the burdens of life are equally shared by all.\r\n\r\nWe saw Melrose by moonlight, spent several hours at Abbotsford, and\r\nlingered in the little sanctum sanctorum where Scott wrote his immortal\r\nworks. It was so small that he could reach the bookshelves on every\r\nside. We went through the prisons, castles, and narrow streets of\r\nEdinburgh, where the houses are seven and eight stories high, each story\r\nprojecting a few feet until, at the uppermost, opposite neighbors could\r\neasily shake hands and chat together. All the intervals from active\r\nsight-seeing we spent in reading the lives of historical personages in\r\npoetry and prose, until our sympathies flowed out to the real and ideal\r\ncharacters. Lady Jane Grey, Anne Boleyn, Mary Queen of Scots, Ellen\r\nDouglas, Jeanie and Effie Deans, Highland Mary, Rebecca the Jewess, Di\r\nVernon, and Rob Roy all alike seemed real men and women, whose shades or\r\ndescendants we hoped to meet on their native heath.\r\n\r\nHere among the Scotch lakes and mountains Mr. Stanton and I were\r\ntraveling alone for the first time since our marriage, and as we both\r\nenjoyed walking, we made many excursions on foot to points that could\r\nnot be reached in any other way. We spent some time among the Grampian\r\nHills, so familiar to every schoolboy, walking, and riding about on\r\ndonkeys. We sailed up and down Loch Katrine and Loch Lomond. My husband\r\nwas writing letters for some New York newspapers on the entire trip, and\r\naimed to get exact knowledge of all we saw; thus I had the advantage of\r\nthe information he gathered. On these long tramps I wore a short dress,\r\nreaching just below the knee, of dark-blue cloth, a military cap of the\r\nsame material that shaded my eyes, and a pair of long boots, made on the\r\nmasculine pattern then generally worn--the most easy style for walking,\r\nas the pressure is equal on the whole foot and the ankle has free play.\r\nThus equipped, and early trained by my good brother-in-law to long\r\nwalks, I found no difficulty in keeping pace with my husband.\r\n\r\nBeing self-reliant and venturesome in our explorations, we occasionally\r\nfound ourselves involved in grave difficulties by refusing to take a\r\nguide. For instance, we decided to go to the top of Ben Nevis alone. It\r\nlooked to us a straightforward piece of business to walk up a mountain\r\nside on a bee line, and so, in the face of repeated warnings by our\r\nhost, we started. We knew nothing of zigzag paths to avoid the rocks,\r\nthe springs, and swamps; in fact we supposed all mountains smooth and\r\ndry, like our native hills that we were accustomed to climb. The\r\nlandlord shook his head and smiled when we told him we should return at\r\nnoon to dinner, and we smiled, too, thinking he placed a low estimate on\r\nour capacity for walking. But we had not gone far when we discovered the\r\ndifficulties ahead. Some places were so steep that I had to hold on to\r\nmy companion's coat tails, while he held on to rocks and twigs, or\r\nbraced himself with a heavy cane. By the time we were halfway up we were\r\nin a dripping perspiration, our feet were soaking wet, and we were\r\nreally too tired to proceed. But, after starting with such supreme\r\nconfidence in ourselves, we were ashamed to confess our fatigue to each\r\nother, and much more to return and verify all the prognostications of\r\nthe host and his guides. So we determined to push on and do what we had\r\nproposed. With the prospect of a magnificent view and an hour's\r\ndelicious rest on the top, we started with renewed courage. A steady\r\nclimb of six hours brought us to the goal of promise; our ascent was\r\naccomplished. But alas! it was impossible to stop there--the cold wind\r\nchilled us to the bone in a minute. So we took one glance at the world\r\nbelow and hurried down the south side to get the mountain between us and\r\nthe cold northeaster.\r\n\r\nWhen your teeth are chattering with the cold, and the wind threatening\r\nto make havoc with your raiment, you are not in a favorable condition to\r\nappreciate grand scenery. Like the king of France with twice ten\r\nthousand men, we marched up the hill and then, marched down again. We\r\nfound descending still more difficult, as we were in constant fear of\r\nslipping, losing our hold, and rolling to the bottom. We were tired,\r\nhungry, and disappointed, and the fear of not reaching the valley before\r\nnightfall pressed heavily upon us. Neither confessed to the other the\r\nfatigue and apprehension each felt, but, with fresh endeavor and words\r\nof encouragement, we cautiously went on. We accidentally struck a trail\r\nthat led us winding down comfortably some distance, but we lost it, and\r\nwent clambering down as well as we could in our usual way. To add to our\r\nmisery, a dense Scotch mist soon enveloped us, so that we could see but\r\na short distance ahead, and not knowing the point from which we started,\r\nwe feared we might be going far out of our way. The coming twilight,\r\ntoo, made the prospect still darker. Fortunately our host, having less\r\nfaith in us than we had in ourselves, sent a guide to reconnoiter, and,\r\njust at the moment when we began to realize our danger of spending the\r\nnight on the mountain, and to admit it to each other, the welcome guide\r\nhailed us in his broad accent. His shepherd dog led the way into the\r\nbeaten path. As I could hardly stand I took the guide's arm, and when we\r\nreached the bottom two donkeys were in readiness to take us to the\r\nhotel.\r\n\r\nWe did not recover from the fatigue of that expedition in several days,\r\nand we made no more experiments of exploring strange places without\r\nguides. We learned, too, that mountains are not so hospitable as they\r\nseem nor so gently undulating as they appear in the distance, and that\r\nguides serve other purposes besides extorting money from travelers. If,\r\nunder their guidance, we had gone up and down easily, we should always\r\nhave thought we might as well have gone alone. So our experience gave us\r\na good lesson in humility. We had been twelve hours on foot with nothing\r\nto eat, when at last we reached the hotel. We were in no mood for\r\nboasting of the success of our excursion, and our answers were short to\r\ninquiries as to how we had passed the day.\r\n\r\nBeing tired of traveling and contending about woman's sphere with the\r\nRev. John Scoble, an Englishman, who escorted Mr. Birney and Mr. Stanton\r\non their tour through the country, I decided to spend a month in Dublin;\r\nwhile the gentlemen held meetings in Cork, Belfast, Waterford, Limerick,\r\nand other chief towns, finishing the series with a large, enthusiastic\r\ngathering in Dublin, at which O'Connell made one of his most withering\r\nspeeches on American slavery; the inconsistency of such an \"institution\"\r\nwith the principles of a republican government giving full play to his\r\npowers of sarcasm. On one occasion, when introduced to a slaveholder, he\r\nput his hands behind his back, refusing to recognize a man who bought\r\nand sold his fellow-beings. The Rev. John Scoble was one of the most\r\nconceited men I ever met. His narrow ideas in regard to woman, and the\r\nsuperiority of the royal and noble classes in his own country, were to\r\nme so exasperating that I grew more and more bellicose every day we\r\ntraveled in company. He was terribly seasick crossing the Channel, to my\r\nintense satisfaction. As he always boasted of his distinguished\r\ncountrymen, I suggested, in the midst of one of his most agonizing\r\nspasms, that he ought to find consolation in the fact that Lord Nelson\r\nwas always seasick on the slightest provocation.\r\n\r\nThe poverty in Ireland was a continual trial to our sensibilities;\r\nbeggars haunted our footsteps everywhere, in the street and on the\r\nhighways, crouching on the steps of the front door and on the\r\ncurbstones, and surrounding our carriage wherever and whenever we\r\nstopped to shop or make a visit. The bony hands and sunken eyes and\r\nsincere gratitude expressed for every penny proved their suffering real.\r\nAs my means were limited and I could not pass one by, I got a pound\r\nchanged into pennies, and put them in a green bag, which I took in the\r\ncarriage wherever I went. It was but a drop in the ocean, but it was all\r\nI could do to relieve that unfathomed misery. The poverty I saw\r\neverywhere in the Old World, and especially in Ireland, was a puzzling\r\nproblem to my mind, but I rejected the idea that it was a necessary link\r\nin human experience--that it always had been and always must be.\r\n\r\nAs we drove, day by day, in that magnificent Phoenix Park, of fifteen\r\nhundred acres, one of the largest parks, I believe, in the world, I\r\nwould often put the question to myself, what right have the few to make\r\na pleasure ground of these acres, while the many have nowhere to lay\r\ntheir heads, crouching under stiles and bridges, clothed in rags, and\r\nfeeding on sea-weed with no hope, in the slowly passing years, of any\r\nchange for the better? The despair stamped on every brow told the sad\r\nstory of their wrongs. Those accustomed to such everyday experiences\r\nbrush beggars aside as they would so many flies, but those to whom such\r\nsights are new cannot so easily quiet their own consciences. Everyone in\r\nthe full enjoyment of all the blessings of life, in his normal\r\ncondition, feels some individual responsibility for the poverty of\r\nothers. When the sympathies are not blunted by any false philosophy, one\r\nfeels reproached by one's own abundance. I once heard a young girl,\r\nabout to take her summer outing, when asked by her grandmother if she\r\nhad all the dresses she needed, reply, \"Oh, yes! I was oppressed with a\r\nconstant sense of guilt, when packing, to see how much I had, while so\r\nmany girls have nothing decent to wear.\"\r\n\r\nMore than half a century has rolled by since I stood on Irish soil, and\r\nshed tears of pity for the wretchedness I saw, and no change for the\r\nbetter has as yet come to that unhappy people--yet this was the land of\r\nBurke, Grattan, Shiel, and Emmett; the land into which Christianity was\r\nintroduced in the fifth century, St. Patrick being the chief apostle of\r\nthe new faith. In the sixth century Ireland sent forth missionaries from\r\nher monasteries to convert Great Britain and the nations of Northern\r\nEurope. From the eighth to the twelfth century Irish scholars held an\r\nenviable reputation. In fact, Ireland was the center of learning at one\r\ntime. The arts, too, were cultivated by her people; and the round\r\ntowers, still pointed out to travelers, are believed to be the remains\r\nof the architecture of the tenth century. The ruin of Ireland must be\r\ntraced to other causes than the character of the people or the Catholic\r\nreligion. Historians give us facts showing English oppressions\r\nsufficient to destroy any nation.\r\n\r\nThe short, dark days of November intensified, in my eyes, the gloomy\r\nprospects of that people, and made the change to the _Sirius_ of the\r\nCunard Line, the first regular Atlantic steamship to cross the ocean,\r\nmost enjoyable. Once on the boundless ocean, one sees no beggars, no\r\nsigns of human misery, no crumbling ruins of vast cathedral walls, no\r\nrecords of the downfall of mighty nations, no trace, even, of the mortal\r\nagony of the innumerable host buried beneath her bosom. Byron truly\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    \"Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow--\r\n    Such as creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we embarked on the _Sirius_, we had grave doubts as to our safety\r\nand the probability of our reaching the other side, as we did not feel\r\nthat ocean steamers had yet been fairly tried. But, after a passage of\r\neighteen days, eleven hours, and fifteen minutes, we reached Boston,\r\nhaving spent six hours at Halifax. We little thought that the steamer\r\n_Sirius_ of fifty years ago would ever develop into the magnificent\r\nfloating palaces of to-day--three times as large and three times as\r\nswift. In spite of the steamer, however, we had a cold, rough, dreary\r\nvoyage, and I have no pleasant memories connected with it. Our\r\nfellow-passengers were all in their staterooms most of the time. Our\r\ngood friend Mr. Birney had sailed two weeks before us, and as Mr.\r\nStanton was confined to his berth, I was thrown on my own resources. I\r\nfound my chief amusement in reading novels and playing chess with a\r\nBritish officer on his way to Canada. When it was possible I walked on\r\ndeck with the captain, or sat in some sheltered corner, watching the\r\nwaves. We arrived in New York, by rail, the day before Christmas.\r\nEverything looked bright and gay in our streets. It seemed to me that\r\nthe sky was clearer, the air more refreshing, and the sunlight more\r\nbrilliant than in any other land!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMOTHERHOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe found my sister Harriet in a new home in Clinton Place (Eighth\r\nStreet), New York city, then considered so far up town that Mr. Eaton's\r\nfriends were continually asking him why he went so far away from the\r\nsocial center, though in a few months they followed him. Here we passed\r\na week. I especially enjoyed seeing my little niece and nephew, the only\r\ngrandchildren in the family. The girl was the most beautiful child I\r\never saw, and the boy the most intelligent and amusing. He was very fond\r\nof hearing me recite the poem by Oliver Wendell Holmes entitled \"The\r\nHeight of the Ridiculous,\" which I did many times, but he always wanted\r\nto see the lines that almost killed the man with laughing. He went\r\naround to a number of the bookstores one day and inquired for them. I\r\ntold him afterward they were never published; that when Mr. Holmes saw\r\nthe effect on his servant he suppressed them, lest they should produce\r\nthe same effect on the typesetters, editors, and the readers of the\r\nBoston newspapers. My explanation never satisfied him. I told him he\r\nmight write to Mr. Holmes, and ask the privilege of reading the original\r\nmanuscript, if it still was or ever had been in existence. As one of my\r\ngrand-nephews was troubled in exactly the same way, I decided to appeal\r\nmyself to Dr. Holmes for the enlightenment of this second generation. So\r\nI wrote him the following letter, which he kindly answered, telling us\r\nthat his \"wretched man\" was a myth like the heroes in \"Mother Goose's\r\nMelodies\":\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR DR. HOLMES:\r\n\r\n     \"I have a little nephew to whom I often recite 'The Height of the\r\n     Ridiculous,' and he invariably asks for the lines that produced the\r\n     fatal effect on your servant. He visited most of the bookstores in\r\n     New York city to find them, and nothing but your own word, I am\r\n     sure, will ever convince him that the 'wretched man' is but a\r\n     figment of your imagination. I tried to satisfy him by saying you\r\n     did not dare to publish the lines lest they should produce a\r\n     similar effect on the typesetters, editors, and the readers of the\r\n     Boston journals.\r\n\r\n     \"However, he wishes me to ask you whether you kept a copy of the\r\n     original manuscript, or could reproduce the lines with equal power.\r\n     If not too much trouble, please send me a few lines on this point,\r\n     and greatly oblige,\r\n\r\n     \"Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n     \"ELIZABETH CADY STANTON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR MRS. STANTON:\r\n\r\n     \"I wish you would explain to your little nephew that the story of\r\n     the poor fellow who almost died laughing was a kind of a dream of\r\n     mine, and not a real thing that happened, any more than that an old\r\n     woman 'lived in a shoe and had so many children she didn't know\r\n     what to do,' or that Jack climbed the bean stalk and found the\r\n     giant who lived at the top of it. You can explain to him what is\r\n     meant by imagination, and thus turn my youthful rhymes into a text\r\n     for a discourse worthy of the Concord School of Philosophy. I have\r\n     not my poems by me here, but I remember that 'The Height of the\r\n     Ridiculous' ended with this verse:\r\n\r\n    \"Ten days and nights, with sleepless eye,\r\n     I watched that wretched man,\r\n    And since, I never dare to write\r\n     As funny as I can.\"\r\n\r\n     \"But tell your nephew he mustn't cry about it any more than because\r\n     geese go barefoot and bald eagles have no nightcaps. The verses are\r\n     in all the editions of my poems.\r\n\r\n     \"Believe me, dear Mrs. Stanton,\r\n\r\n     \"Very Truly and Respectfully Yours,\r\n\r\n     \"OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.\"\r\n\r\nAfter spending the holidays in New York city, we started for Johnstown\r\nin a \"stage sleigh, conveying the United States mail,\" drawn by spanking\r\nteams of four horses, up the Hudson River valley. We were three days\r\ngoing to Albany, stopping over night at various points; a journey now\r\nperformed in three hours. The weather was clear and cold, the sleighing\r\nfine, the scenery grand, and our traveling companions most entertaining,\r\nso the trip was very enjoyable. From Albany to Schenectady we went in\r\nthe railway cars; then another sleighride of thirty miles brought us to\r\nJohnstown. My native hills, buried under two feet of snow, tinted with\r\nthe last rays of the setting sun, were a beautiful and familiar sight.\r\nThough I had been absent but ten months, it seemed like years, and I was\r\nsurprised to find how few changes had occurred since I left. My father\r\nand mother, sisters Madge and Kate, the old house and furniture, the\r\nneighbors, all looked precisely the same as when I left them. I had\r\nseen so much and been so constantly on the wing that I wondered that all\r\nthings here should have stood still. I expected to hear of many births,\r\nmarriages, deaths, and social upheavals, but the village news was\r\nremarkably meager. This hunger for home news on returning is common, I\r\nsuppose, to all travelers.\r\n\r\nOur trunks unpacked, wardrobes arranged in closets and drawers, the\r\nexcitement of seeing friends over, we spent some time in making plans\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nMy husband, after some consultation with my father, decided to enter his\r\noffice and commence the study of the law. As this arrangement kept me\r\nunder the parental roof, I had two added years of pleasure, walking,\r\ndriving, and riding on horseback with my sisters. Madge and Kate were\r\ndearer to me than ever, as I saw the inevitable separation awaiting us\r\nin the near future. In due time they were married and commenced\r\nhousekeeping--Madge in her husband's house near by, and Kate in Buffalo.\r\nAll my sisters were peculiarly fortunate in their marriages; their\r\nhusbands being men of fine presence, liberal education, high moral\r\ncharacter, and marked ability. These were pleasant and profitable years.\r\nI devoted them to reading law, history, and political economy, with\r\noccasional interruptions to take part in some temperance or anti-slavery\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nEliza Murray and I had classes of colored children in the Sunday school.\r\nOn one occasion, when there was to be a festival, speaking in the\r\nchurch, a procession through the streets, and other public performances\r\nfor the Sunday-school celebration, some narrow-minded bigots objected to\r\nthe colored children taking part. They approached Miss Murray and me\r\nwith most persuasive tones on the wisdom of not allowing them to march\r\nin the procession to the church. We said, \"Oh, no! It won't do to\r\ndisappoint the children. They are all dressed, with their badges on, and\r\nlooking forward with great pleasure to the festivities of the day.\r\nBesides, we would not cater to any of these contemptible prejudices\r\nagainst color.\" We were all assembled in the courthouse preparatory to\r\nforming in the line of march. Some were determined to drive the colored\r\nchildren home, but Miss Murray and I, like two defiant hens, kept our\r\nlittle brood close behind us, determined to conquer or perish in the\r\nstruggle. At last milder counsels prevailed, and it was agreed that they\r\nmight march in the rear. We made no objection and fell into line, but,\r\nwhen we reached the church door, it was promptly closed as the last\r\nwhite child went in. We tried two other doors, but all were guarded. We\r\nshed tears of vexation and pity for the poor children, and, when they\r\nasked us the reason why they could not go in, we were embarrassed and\r\nmortified with the explanation we were forced to give. However, I\r\ninvited them to my father's house, where Miss Murray and I gave them\r\nrefreshments and entertained them for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nThe puzzling questions of theology and poverty that had occupied so much\r\nof my thoughts, now gave place to the practical one, \"what to do with a\r\nbaby.\" Though motherhood is the most important of all the\r\nprofessions,--requiring more knowledge than any other department in\r\nhuman affairs,--yet there is not sufficient attention given to the\r\npreparation for this office. If we buy a plant of a horticulturist we\r\nask him many questions as to its needs, whether it thrives best in\r\nsunshine or in shade, whether it needs much or little water, what\r\ndegrees of heat or cold; but when we hold in our arms for the first\r\ntime, a being of infinite possibilities, in whose wisdom may rest the\r\ndestiny of a nation, we take it for granted that the laws governing its\r\nlife, health, and happiness are intuitively understood, that there is\r\nnothing new to be learned in regard to it. Yet here is a science to\r\nwhich philosophers have, as yet, given but little attention. An\r\nimportant fact has only been discovered and acted upon within the last\r\nten years, that children come into the world tired, and not hungry,\r\nexhausted with the perilous journey. Instead of being thoroughly bathed\r\nand dressed, and kept on the rack while the nurse makes a prolonged\r\ntoilet and feeds it some nostrum supposed to have much needed medicinal\r\ninfluence, the child's face, eyes, and mouth should be hastily washed\r\nwith warm water, and the rest of its body thoroughly oiled, and then it\r\nshould be slipped into a soft pillow case, wrapped in a blanket, and\r\nlaid to sleep. Ordinarily, in the proper conditions, with its face\r\nuncovered in a cool, pure atmosphere, it will sleep twelve hours. Then\r\nit should be bathed, fed, and clothed in a high-necked, long-sleeved\r\nsilk shirt and a blanket, all of which could be done in five minutes. As\r\nbabies lie still most of the time the first six weeks, they need no\r\ndressing. I think the nurse was a full hour bathing and dressing my\r\nfirstborn, who protested with a melancholy wail every blessed minute.\r\n\r\nIgnorant myself of the initiative steps on the threshold of time, I\r\nsupposed this proceeding was approved by the best authorities. However,\r\nI had been thinking, reading, observing, and had as little faith in the\r\npopular theories in regard to babies as on any other subject. I saw\r\nthem, on all sides, ill half the time, pale and peevish, dying early,\r\nhaving no joy in life. I heard parents complaining of weary days and\r\nsleepless nights, while each child, in turn, ran the gauntlet of red\r\ngum, jaundice, whooping cough, chicken-pox, mumps, measles, scarlet\r\nfever, and fits. They all seemed to think these inflictions were a part\r\nof the eternal plan--that Providence had a kind of Pandora's box, from\r\nwhich he scattered these venerable diseases most liberally among those\r\nwhom he especially loved. Having gone through the ordeal of bearing a\r\nchild, I was determined, if possible, to keep him, so I read everything\r\nI could find on the subject. But the literature on this subject was as\r\nconfusing and unsatisfactory as the longer and shorter catechisms and\r\nthe Thirty-nine Articles of our faith. I had recently visited our dear\r\nfriends, Theodore and Angelina Grimke-Weld, and they warned me against\r\nbooks on this subject. They had been so misled by one author, who\r\nassured them that the stomach of a child could only hold one\r\ntablespoonful, that they nearly starved their firstborn to death. Though\r\nthe child dwindled, day by day, and, at the end of a month, looked like\r\na little old man, yet they still stood by the distinguished author.\r\nFortunately, they both went off, one day, and left the child with Sister\r\n\"Sarah,\" who thought she would make an experiment and see what a child's\r\nstomach could hold, as she had grave doubts about the tablespoonful\r\ntheory. To her surprise the baby took a pint bottle full of milk, and\r\nhad the sweetest sleep thereon he had known in his earthly career. After\r\nthat he was permitted to take what he wanted, and \"the author\" was\r\ninformed of his libel on the infantile stomach.\r\n\r\nSo here, again, I was entirely afloat, launched on the seas of doubt\r\nwithout chart or compass. The life and well-being of the race seemed to\r\nhang on the slender thread of such traditions as were handed down\r\nby-ignorant mothers and nurses. One powerful ray of light illuminated\r\nthe darkness; it was the work of Andrew Combe on \"Infancy.\" He had,\r\nevidently watched some of the manifestations of man in the first stages\r\nof his development, and could tell, at least, as much of babies as\r\nnaturalists could of beetles and bees. He did give young mothers some\r\nhints of what to do, the whys and wherefores of certain lines of\r\nprocedure during antenatal life, as well as the proper care thereafter.\r\nI read several chapters to the nurse. Although, out of her ten children,\r\nshe had buried five, she still had too much confidence in her own wisdom\r\nand experience to pay much attention to any new idea that might be\r\nsuggested to her. Among other things, Combe said that a child's bath\r\nshould be regulated by the thermometer, in order to be always of the\r\nsame temperature. She ridiculed the idea, and said her elbow was better\r\nthan any thermometer, and, when I insisted on its use, she would\r\ninvariably, with a smile of derision, put her elbow in first, to show\r\nhow exactly it tallied with the thermometer. When I insisted that the\r\nchild should not be bandaged, she rebelled outright, and said she would\r\nnot take the responsibility of nursing a child without a bandage. I\r\nsaid, \"Pray, sit down, dear nurse, and let us reason together. Do not\r\nthink I am setting up my judgment against yours, with all your\r\nexperience. I am simply trying to act on the opinions of a\r\ndistinguished physician, who says there should be no pressure on a child\r\nanywhere; that the limbs and body should be free; that it is cruel to\r\nbandage an infant from hip to armpit, as is usually done in America; or\r\nboth body and legs, as is done in Europe; or strap them to boards, as is\r\ndone by savages on both continents. Can you give me one good reason,\r\nnurse, why a child should be bandaged?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said emphatically, \"I can give you a dozen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only asked for one,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said she, after much hesitation, \"the bones of a newborn infant\r\nare soft, like cartilage, and, unless you pin them up snugly, there is\r\ndanger of their falling apart.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" I replied, \"you have given the strongest reason why\r\nthey should be carefully guarded against the slightest pressure. It is\r\nvery remarkable that kittens and puppies should be so well put together\r\nthat they need no artificial bracing, and the human family be left\r\nwholly to the mercy of a bandage. Suppose a child was born where you\r\ncould not get a bandage, what then? Now I think this child will remain\r\nintact without a bandage, and, if I am willing to take the risk, why\r\nshould you complain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said she, \"if the child should die, it would injure my name\r\nas a nurse. I therefore wash my hands of all these new-fangled notions.\"\r\n\r\nSo she bandaged the child every morning, and I as regularly took it off.\r\nIt has been fully proved since to be as useless an appendage as the\r\nvermiform. She had several cups with various concoctions of herbs\r\nstanding on the chimney-corner, ready for insomnia, colic, indigestion,\r\netc., etc., all of which were spirited away when she was at her dinner.\r\nIn vain I told her we were homeopathists, and afraid of everything in\r\nthe animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdoms lower than the two-hundredth\r\ndilution. I tried to explain the Hahnemann system of therapeutics, the\r\nphilosophy of the principle _similia similibus curantur_, but she had no\r\ncapacity for first principles, and did not understand my discourse. I\r\ntold her that, if she would wash the baby's mouth with pure cold water\r\nmorning and night and give it a teaspoonful to drink occasionally during\r\nthe day, there would be no danger of red gum; that if she would keep the\r\nblinds open and let in the air and sunshine, keep the temperature of the\r\nroom at sixty-five degrees, leave the child's head uncovered so that it\r\ncould breathe freely, stop rocking and trotting it and singing such\r\nmelancholy hymns as \"Hark, from the tombs a doleful sound!\" the baby and\r\nI would both be able to weather the cape without a bandage. I told her I\r\nshould nurse the child once in two hours, and that she must not feed it\r\nany of her nostrums in the meantime; that a child's stomach, being made\r\non the same general plan as our own, needed intervals of rest as well as\r\nours. She said it would be racked with colic if the stomach was empty\r\nany length of time, and that it would surely have rickets if it were\r\nkept too still. I told her if the child had no anodynes, nature would\r\nregulate its sleep and motions. She said she could not stay in a room\r\nwith the thermometer at sixty-five degrees, so I told her to sit in the\r\nnext room and regulate the heat to suit herself; that I would ring a\r\nbell when her services were needed.\r\n\r\nThe reader will wonder, no doubt, that I kept such a cantankerous\r\nservant. I could get no other. Dear \"Mother Monroe,\" as wise as she was\r\ngood, and as tender as she was strong, who had nursed two generations of\r\nmothers in our village, was engaged at that time, and I was compelled to\r\ntake an exotic. I had often watched \"Mother Monroe\" with admiration, as\r\nshe turned and twisted my sister's baby. It lay as peacefully in her\r\nhands as if they were lined with eider down. She bathed and dressed it\r\nby easy stages, turning the child over and over like a pancake. But she\r\nwas so full of the magnetism of human love, giving the child, all the\r\ntime, the most consoling assurance that the operation was to be a short\r\none, that the whole proceeding was quite entertaining to the observer\r\nand seemingly agreeable to the child, though it had a rather surprised\r\nlook as it took a bird's-eye view, in quick succession, of the ceiling\r\nand the floor. Still my nurse had her good points. She was very pleasant\r\nwhen she had her own way. She was neat and tidy, and ready to serve me\r\nat any time, night or day. She did not wear false teeth that rattled\r\nwhen she talked, nor boots that squeaked when she walked. She did not\r\nsnuff nor chew cloves, nor speak except when spoken to. Our discussions,\r\non various points, went on at intervals, until I succeeded in planting\r\nsome ideas in her mind, and when she left me, at the end of six weeks,\r\nshe confessed that she had learned some valuable lessons. As the baby\r\nhad slept quietly most of the time, had no crying spells, nor colic, and\r\nI looked well, she naturally came to the conclusion that pure air,\r\nsunshine, proper dressing, and regular feeding were more necessary for\r\nbabies than herb teas and soothing syrups.\r\n\r\nBesides the obstinacy of the nurse, I had the ignorance of physicians\r\nto contend with. When the child was four days old we discovered that the\r\ncollar bone was bent. The physician, wishing to get a pressure on the\r\nshoulder, braced the bandage round the wrist. \"Leave that,\" he said,\r\n\"ten days, and then it will be all right.\" Soon after he left I noticed\r\nthat the child's hand was blue, showing that the circulation was\r\nimpeded. \"That will never do,\" said I; \"nurse, take it off.\" \"No,\r\nindeed,\" she answered, \"I shall never interfere with the doctor.\" So I\r\ntook it off myself, and sent for another doctor, who was said to know\r\nmore of surgery. He expressed great surprise that the first physician\r\ncalled should have put on so severe a bandage. \"That,\" said he, \"would\r\ndo for a grown man, but ten days of it on a child would make him a\r\ncripple.\" However, he did nearly the same thing, only fastening it round\r\nthe hand instead of the wrist. I soon saw that the ends of the fingers\r\nwere all purple, and that to leave that on ten days would be as\r\ndangerous as the first. So I took that off.\r\n\r\n\"What a woman!\" exclaimed the nurse. \"What do you propose to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Think out something better, myself; so brace me up with some pillows\r\nand give the baby to me.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at me aghast and said, \"You'd better trust the doctors, or\r\nyour child will be a helpless cripple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"he would be, if we had left either of those bandages\r\non, but I have an idea of something better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said I, talking partly to myself and partly to her, \"what we want\r\nis a little pressure on that bone; that is what both those men aimed at.\r\nHow can we get it without involving the arm, is the question?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I don't know,\" said she, rubbing her hands and taking two or\r\nthree brisk turns round the room.\r\n\r\n\"Well, bring me three strips of linen, four double.\" I then folded one,\r\nwet in arnica and water, and laid it on the collar bone, put two other\r\nbands, like a pair of suspenders, over the shoulders, crossing them both\r\nin front and behind, pinning the ends to the diaper, which gave the\r\nneeded pressure without impeding the circulation anywhere. As I finished\r\nshe gave me a look of budding confidence, and seemed satisfied that all\r\nwas well. Several times, night and day, we wet the compress and\r\nreadjusted the bands, until all appearances of inflammation had\r\nsubsided.\r\n\r\nAt the end of ten days the two sons of Aesculapius appeared and made\r\ntheir examination and said all was right, whereupon I told them how\r\nbadly their bandages worked and what I had done myself. They smiled at\r\neach other, and one said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, after all, a mother's instinct is better than a man's reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, gentlemen, there was no instinct about it. I did some hard\r\nthinking before I saw how I could get a pressure on the shoulder without\r\nimpeding the circulation, as you did.\"\r\n\r\nThus, in the supreme moment of a young mother's life, when I needed\r\ntender care and support, I felt the whole responsibility of my child's\r\nsupervision; but though uncertain at every step of my own knowledge, I\r\nlearned another lesson in self-reliance. I trusted neither men nor books\r\nabsolutely after this, either in regard to the heavens above or the\r\nearth beneath, but continued to use my \"mother's instinct,\" if \"reason\"\r\nis too dignified a term to apply to woman's thoughts. My advice to every\r\nmother is, above all other arts and sciences, study first what relates\r\nto babyhood, as there is no department of human action in which there is\r\nsuch lamentable ignorance.\r\n\r\nAt the end of six weeks my nurse departed, and I had a good woman in her\r\nplace who obeyed my orders, and now a new difficulty arose from an\r\nunexpected quarter. My father and husband took it into their heads that\r\nthe child slept too much. If not awake when they wished to look at him\r\nor to show him to their friends, they would pull him out of his crib on\r\nall occasions. When I found neither of them was amenable to reason on\r\nthis point, I locked the door, and no amount of eloquent pleading ever\r\ngained them admittance during the time I considered sacred to the baby's\r\nslumbers. At six months having, as yet, had none of the diseases\r\nsupposed to be inevitable, the boy weighed thirty pounds. Then the\r\nstately Peter came again into requisition, and in his strong arms the\r\nchild spent many of his waking hours. Peter, with a long, elephantine\r\ngait, slowly wandered over the town, lingering especially in the busy\r\nmarts of trade. Peter's curiosity had strengthened with years, and,\r\nwherever a crowd gathered round a monkey and hand organ, a vender's\r\nwagon, an auction stand, or the post office at mail time, there stood\r\nPeter, black as coal, with \"the beautiful boy in white,\" the most\r\nconspicuous figure in the crowd. As I told Peter never to let children\r\nkiss the baby, for fear of some disease, he kept him well aloft,\r\nallowing no affectionate manifestations except toward himself.\r\n\r\nMy reading, at this time, centered on hygiene. I came to the\r\nconclusion, after much thought and observation, that children never\r\ncried unless they were uncomfortable. A professor at Union College, who\r\nused to combat many of my theories, said he gave one of his children a\r\nsound spanking at six weeks, and it never disturbed him a night\r\nafterward. Another Solomon told me that a very weak preparation of opium\r\nwould keep a child always quiet and take it through the dangerous period\r\nof teething without a ripple on the surface of domestic life. As\r\nchildren cannot tell what ails them, and suffer from many things of\r\nwhich parents are ignorant, the crying of the child should arouse them\r\nto an intelligent examination. To spank it for crying is to silence the\r\nwatchman on the tower through fear, to give soothing syrup is to drug\r\nthe watchman while the evils go on. Parents may thereby insure eight\r\nhours' sleep at the time, but at the risk of greater trouble in the\r\nfuture with sick and dying children. Tom Moore tells us \"the heart from\r\nlove to one, grows bountiful to all.\" I know the care of one child made\r\nme thoughtful of all. I never hear a child cry, now, that I do not feel\r\nthat I am bound to find out the reason.\r\n\r\nIn my extensive travels on lecturing tours, in after years, I had many\r\nvaried experiences with babies. One day, in the cars, a child was crying\r\nnear me, while the parents were alternately shaking and slapping it.\r\nFirst one would take it with an emphatic jerk, and then the other. At\r\nlast I heard the father say in a spiteful tone, \"If you don't stop I'll\r\nthrow you out of the window.\" One naturally hesitates about interfering\r\nbetween parents and children, so I generally restrain myself as long as\r\nI can endure the torture of witnessing such outrages, but at length I\r\nturned and said:\r\n\r\n\"Let me take your child and see if I can find out what ails it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing ails it,\" said the father, \"but bad temper.\"\r\n\r\nThe child readily came to me. I felt all around to see if its clothes\r\npinched anywhere, or if there were any pins pricking. I took off its hat\r\nand cloak to see if there were any strings cutting its neck or choking\r\nit. Then I glanced at the feet, and lo! there was the trouble. The boots\r\nwere at least one size too small. I took them off, and the stockings,\r\ntoo, and found the feet as cold as ice and the prints of the stockings\r\nclearly traced on the tender flesh. We all know the agony of tight\r\nboots. I rubbed the feet and held them in my hands until they were warm,\r\nwhen the poor little thing fell asleep. I said to the parents, \"You are\r\nyoung people, I see, and this is probably your first child.\" They said,\r\n\"Yes.\" \"You don't intend to be cruel, I know, but if you had thrown\r\nthose boots out of the window, when you threatened to throw the child,\r\nit would have been wiser. This poor child has suffered ever since it was\r\ndressed this morning.\" I showed them the marks on the feet, and called\r\ntheir attention to the fact that the child fell asleep as soon as its\r\npain was relieved. The mother said she knew the boots were tight, as it\r\nwas with difficulty she could get them on, but the old ones were too\r\nshabby for the journey and they had no time to change the others.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the husband, \"if I had known those boots were tight, I\r\nwould have thrown them out of the window.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said I, \"let me give you one rule: when your child cries,\r\nremember it is telling you, as well as it can, that something hurts it,\r\neither outside or in, and do not rest until you find what it is.\r\nNeither spanking, shaking, or scolding can relieve pain.\"\r\n\r\nI have seen women enter the cars with their babies' faces completely\r\ncovered with a blanket shawl. I have often thought I would like to cover\r\ntheir faces for an hour and see how they would bear it. In such\r\ncircumstances, in order to get the blanket open, I have asked to see the\r\nbaby, and generally found it as red as a beet. Ignorant nurses and\r\nmothers have discovered that children sleep longer with their heads\r\ncovered. They don't know why, nor the injurious effect of breathing over\r\nand over the same air that has been thrown off the lungs polluted with\r\ncarbonic acid gas. This stupefies the child and prolongs the unhealthy\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nOne hot day, in the month of May, I entered a crowded car at Cedar\r\nRapids, Ia., and took the only empty seat beside a gentleman who seemed\r\nvery nervous about a crying child. I was scarcely seated when he said:\r\n\r\n\"Mother, do you know anything about babies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" I said, smiling, \"that is a department of knowledge on which\r\nI especially pride myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"there is a child that has cried most of the time for\r\nthe last twenty-four hours. What do you think ails it?\"\r\n\r\nMaking a random supposition, I replied, \"It probably needs a bath.\"\r\n\r\nHe promptly rejoined, \"If you will give it one, I will provide the\r\nnecessary means.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"I will first see if the child will come to me and if the mother\r\nis willing.\"\r\n\r\nI found the mother only too glad to have a few minutes' rest, and the\r\nchild too tired to care who took it. She gave me a suit of clean\r\nclothes throughout, the gentleman spread his blanket shawl on the seat,\r\nsecuring the opposite one for me and the bathing appliances. Then he\r\nproduced a towel, sponge, and an india-rubber bowl full of water, and I\r\ngave the child a generous drink and a thorough ablution. It stretched\r\nand seemed to enjoy every step of the proceeding, and, while I was\r\nbrushing its golden curls as gently as I could, it fell asleep; so I\r\ncovered it with the towel and blanket shawl, not willing to disturb it\r\nfor dressing. The poor mother, too, was sound asleep, and the gentleman\r\nvery happy. He had children of his own and, like me, felt great pity for\r\nthe poor, helpless little victim of ignorance and folly. I engaged one\r\nof the ladies to dress it when it awoke, as I was soon to leave the\r\ntrain. It slept the two hours I remained--how much longer I never heard.\r\n\r\nA young man, who had witnessed the proceeding, got off at the same\r\nstation and accosted me, saying:\r\n\r\n\"I should be very thankful if you would come and see my baby. It is only\r\none month old and cries all the time, and my wife, who is only sixteen\r\nyears old, is worn out with it and neither of us know what to do, so we\r\nall cry together, and the doctor says he does not see what ails it.\"\r\n\r\nSo I went on my mission of mercy and found the child bandaged as tight\r\nas a drum. When I took out the pins and unrolled it, it fairly popped\r\nlike the cork out of a champagne bottle. I rubbed its breast and its\r\nback and soon soothed it to sleep. I remained a long time, telling them\r\nhow to take care of the child and the mother, too. I told them\r\neverything I could think of in regard to clothes, diet, and pure air. I\r\nasked the mother why she bandaged her child as she did. She said her\r\nnurse told her that there was danger of hernia unless the abdomen was\r\nwell bandaged. I told her that the only object of a bandage was to\r\nprotect the navel, for a few days, until it was healed, and for that\r\npurpose all that was necessary was a piece of linen four inches square,\r\nwell oiled, folded four times double, with a hole in the center, laid\r\nover it. I remembered, next day, that I forgot to tell them to give the\r\nchild water, and so I telegraphed them, \"Give the baby water six times a\r\nday.\" I heard of that baby afterward. It lived and flourished, and the\r\nparents knew how to administer to the wants of the next one. The father\r\nwas a telegraph operator and had many friends--knights of the\r\nkey--throughout Iowa. For many years afterward, in leisure moments,\r\nthese knights would \"call up\" this parent and say, over the wire, \"Give\r\nthe baby water six times a day.\" Thus did they \"repeat the story, and\r\nspread the truth from pole to pole.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nBOSTON AND CHELSEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1843 my husband was admitted to the bar and commenced\r\nthe practice of law in Boston with Mr. Bowles, brother-in-law of the\r\nlate General John A. Dix. This gave me the opportunity to make many\r\npleasant acquaintances among the lawyers in Boston, and to meet,\r\nintimately, many of the noble men and women among reformers, whom I had\r\nlong worshiped at a distance. Here, for the first time, I met Lydia\r\nMaria Child, Abby Kelly, Paulina Wright, Elizabeth Peabody, Maria\r\nChapman and her beautiful sisters, the Misses Weston, Oliver and\r\nMarianna Johnson, Joseph and Thankful Southwick and their three bright\r\ndaughters. The home of the Southwicks was always a harbor of rest for\r\nthe weary, where the anti-slavery hosts were wont to congregate, and\r\nwhere one was always sure to meet someone worth knowing. Their\r\nhospitality was generous to an extreme, and so boundless that they were,\r\nat last, fairly eaten out of house and home. Here, too, for the first\r\ntime, I met Theodore Parker, John Pierpont, John G. Whittier, Emerson,\r\nAlcott, Lowell, Hawthorne, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel E. Sewall, Sidney Howard\r\nGay, Pillsbury, Foster, Frederick Douglass, and last though not least,\r\nthose noble men, Charles Hovey and Francis Jackson, the only men who\r\never left any money to the cause of woman suffrage. I also met Miss\r\nJackson, afterward Mrs. Eddy, who left half her fortune, fifty thousand\r\ndollars, for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nI was a frequent visitor at the home of William Lloyd Garrison. Though\r\nhe had a prolonged battle to fight in the rough outside world, his home\r\nwas always a haven of rest. Mrs. Garrison was a sweet-tempered,\r\nconscientious woman, who tried, under all circumstances, to do what was\r\nright. She had sound judgment and rare common sense, was tall and\r\nfine-looking, with luxuriant brown hair, large tender blue eyes,\r\ndelicate features, and affable manners. They had an exceptionally fine\r\nfamily of five sons and one daughter. Fanny, now the wife of Henry\r\nVillard, the financier, was the favorite and pet. All the children, in\r\ntheir maturer years, have fulfilled the promises of their childhood.\r\nThough always in straitened circumstances, the Garrisons were very\r\nhospitable. It was next to impossible for Mr. Garrison to meet a friend\r\nwithout inviting him to his house, especially at the close of a\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nI was one of twelve at one of his impromptu tea parties. We all took it\r\nfor granted that his wife knew we were coming, and that her preparations\r\nwere already made. Surrounded by half a dozen children, she was\r\nperforming the last act in the opera of Lullaby, wholly unconscious of\r\nthe invasion downstairs. But Mr. Garrison was equal to every emergency,\r\nand, after placing his guests at their ease in the parlor, he hastened\r\nto the nursery, took off his coat, and rocked the baby until his wife\r\nhad disposed of the remaining children. Then they had a consultation\r\nabout the tea, and when, basket in hand, the good man sallied forth for\r\nthe desired viands, Mrs. Garrison, having made a hasty toilet, came\r\ndown to welcome her guests. She was as genial and self-possessed as if\r\nall things had been prepared. She made no apologies for what was lacking\r\nin the general appearance of the house nor in the variety of the\r\n_menu_--it was sufficient for her to know that Mr. Garrison was happy in\r\nfeeling free to invite his friends. The impromptu meal was excellent,\r\nand we had a most enjoyable evening. I have no doubt that Mrs. Garrison\r\nhad more real pleasure than if she had been busy all day making\r\npreparations and had been tired out when her guests arrived.\r\n\r\nThe anti-slavery conventions and fairs, held every year during the\r\nholidays, brought many charming people from other States, and made\r\nBoston a social center for the coadjutors of Garrison and Phillips.\r\nThese conventions surpassed any meetings I had ever attended; the\r\nspeeches were eloquent and the debates earnest and forcible. Garrison\r\nand Phillips were in their prime, and slavery was a question of national\r\ninterest. The hall in which the fairs were held, under the auspices of\r\nMrs. Chapman and her cohorts, was most artistically decorated. There one\r\ncould purchase whatever the fancy could desire, for English friends,\r\nstimulated by the appeals of Harriet Martineau and Elizabeth Pease, used\r\nto send boxes of beautiful things, gathered from all parts of the\r\nEastern Continent. There, too, one could get a most _recherché_ luncheon\r\nin the society of the literati of Boston; for, however indifferent many\r\nwere to slavery _per se_, they enjoyed these fairs, and all classes\r\nflocked there till far into the night. It was a kind of ladies' exchange\r\nfor the holiday week, where each one was sure to meet her friends. The\r\nfair and the annual convention, coming in succession, intensified the\r\ninterest in both. I never grew weary of the conventions, though I\r\nattended all the sessions, lasting, sometimes, until eleven o'clock at\r\nnight. The fiery eloquence of the abolitionists, the amusing episodes\r\nthat occurred when some crank was suppressed and borne out on the\r\nshoulders of his brethren, gave sufficient variety to the proceedings to\r\nkeep the interest up to high-water mark.\r\n\r\nThere was one old man dressed in white, carrying a scythe, who imagined\r\nhimself the personification of \"Time,\" though called \"Father Lampson.\"\r\nOccasionally he would bubble over with some prophetic vision, and, as he\r\ncould not be silenced, he was carried out. He usually made himself as\r\nlimp as possible, which added to the difficulty of his exit and the\r\namusement of the audience. A ripple of merriment would unsettle, for a\r\nmoment, even the dignity of the platform when Abigail Folsom, another\r\ncrank, would shout from the gallery, \"Stop not, my brother, on the order\r\nof your going, but go.\" The abolitionists were making the experiment, at\r\nthis time, of a free platform, allowing everyone to speak as moved by\r\nthe spirit, but they soon found that would not do, as those evidently\r\nmoved by the spirit of mischief were quite as apt to air their vagaries\r\nas those moved by the spirit of truth.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Garrisonian platform always maintained a certain degree of\r\nfreedom outside its regular programme, and, although this involved extra\r\nduty in suppressing cranks, yet the meeting gained enthusiasm by some\r\ngood spontaneous speaking on the floor as well as on the platform. A\r\nnumber of immense mass meetings were held in Faneuil Hall, a large,\r\ndreary place, with its bare walls and innumerable dingy windows. The\r\nonly attempt at an ornament was the American eagle, with its wings\r\nspread and claws firmly set, in the middle of the gallery. The gilt was\r\nworn off its beak, giving it the appearance, as Edmund Quincy said, of\r\nhaving a bad cold in the head.\r\n\r\nThis old hall was sacred to so many memories connected with the early\r\ndays of the Revolution that it was a kind of Mecca for the lovers of\r\nliberty visiting Boston. The anti-slavery meetings held there were often\r\ndisturbed by mobs that would hold the most gifted orator at bay hour\r\nafter hour, and would listen only to the songs of the Hutchinson family.\r\nAlthough these songs were a condensed extract of the whole anti-slavery\r\nconstitution and by-laws, yet the mob was as peaceful under these paeans\r\nto liberty as a child under the influence of an anodyne. What a welcome\r\nand beautiful vision that was when the four brothers, in blue broadcloth\r\nand white collars, turned down _à la_ Byron, and little sister Abby in\r\nsilk, soft lace, and blue ribbon, appeared on the platform to sing their\r\nquaint ballads of freedom! Fresh from the hills of New Hampshire, they\r\nlooked so sturdy, so vigorous, so pure, so true that they seemed fitting\r\nrepresentatives of all the cardinal virtues, and even a howling mob\r\ncould not resist their influence. Perhaps, after one of their ballads,\r\nthe mob would listen five minutes to Wendell Phillips or Garrison until\r\nhe gave them some home thrusts, when all was uproar again. The Northern\r\nmerchants who made their fortunes out of Southern cotton, the\r\npoliticians who wanted votes, and the ministers who wanted to keep peace\r\nin the churches, were all as much opposed to the anti-slavery agitation\r\nas were the slaveholders themselves. These were the classes the mob\r\nrepresented, though seemingly composed of gamblers, liquor dealers, and\r\ndemagogues. For years the anti-slavery struggle at the North was carried\r\non against statecraft, priestcraft, the cupidity of the moneyed classes,\r\nand the ignorance of the masses, but, in spite of all these forces of\r\nevil, it triumphed at last.\r\n\r\nI was in Boston at the time that Lane and Wright, some metaphysical\r\nEnglishmen, and our own Alcott held their famous philosophical\r\nconversations, in which Elizabeth Peabody took part. I went to them\r\nregularly. I was ambitious to absorb all the wisdom I could, but,\r\nreally, I could not give an intelligent report of the points under\r\ndiscussion at any sitting. Oliver Johnson asked me, one day, if I\r\nenjoyed them. I thought, from a twinkle in his eye, that he thought I\r\ndid not, so I told him I was ashamed to confess that I did not know what\r\nthey were talking about. He said, \"Neither do I,--very few of their\r\nhearers do,--so you need not be surprised that they are incomprehensible\r\nto you, nor think less of your own capacity.\"\r\n\r\nI was indebted to Mr. Johnson for several of the greatest pleasures I\r\nenjoyed in Boston. He escorted me to an entire course of Theodore\r\nParker's lectures, given in Marlborough Chapel. This was soon after the\r\ngreat preacher had given his famous sermon on \"The Permanent and\r\nTransient in Religion,\" when he was ostracised, even by the Unitarians,\r\nfor his radical utterances, and not permitted to preach in any of their\r\npulpits. His lectures were deemed still more heterodox than that sermon.\r\nHe shocked the orthodox churches of that day--more, even, than Ingersoll\r\nhas in our times.\r\n\r\nThe lectures, however, were so soul-satisfying to me that I was\r\nsurprised at the bitter criticisms I heard expressed. Though they were\r\ntwo hours long, I never grew weary, and, when the course ended, I said\r\nto Mr. Johnson:\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could hear them over again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can,\" said he, \"Mr. Parker is to repeat them in\r\nCambridgeport, beginning next week.\" Accordingly we went there and heard\r\nthem again with equal satisfaction.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter in Boston I attended all the lectures, churches,\r\ntheaters, concerts, and temperance, peace, and prison-reform conventions\r\nwithin my reach. I had never lived in such an enthusiastically literary\r\nand reform latitude before, and my mental powers were kept at the\r\nhighest tension. We went to Chelsea, for the summer, and boarded with\r\nthe Baptist minister, the Rev. John Wesley Olmstead, afterward editor of\r\n_The Watchman and Reflector_. He had married my cousin, Mary Livingston,\r\none of the most lovely, unselfish characters I ever knew. There I had\r\nthe opportunity of meeting several of the leading Baptist ministers in\r\nNew England, and, as I was thoroughly imbued with Parker's ideas, we had\r\nmany heated discussions on theology. There, too, I met Orestes Bronson,\r\na remarkably well-read man, who had gone through every phase of\r\nreligious experience from blank atheism to the bosom of the Catholic\r\nChurch, where I believe he found repose at the end of his days. He was\r\nso arbitrary and dogmatic that most people did not like him; but I\r\nappreciated his acquaintance, as he was a liberal thinker and had a\r\nworld of information which he readily imparted to those of a teachable\r\nspirit. As I was then in a hungering, thirsting condition for truth on\r\nevery subject, the friendship of such a man was, to me, an inestimable\r\nblessing. Reading Theodore Parker's lectures, years afterward, I was\r\nsurprised to find how little there was in them to shock anybody--the\r\nmajority of thinking people having grown up to them.\r\n\r\nWhile living in Chelsea two years, I used to walk (there being no public\r\nconveyances running on Sunday) from the ferry to Marlborough Chapel to\r\nhear Mr. Parker preach. It was a long walk, over two miles, and I was so\r\ntired, on reaching the chapel, that I made it a point to sleep through\r\nall the preliminary service, so as to be fresh for the sermon, as the\r\nfriend next whom I sat always wakened me in time. One Sunday, when my\r\nfriend was absent, it being a very warm day and I unusually fatigued, I\r\nslept until the sexton informed me that he was about to close the doors!\r\nIn an unwary moment I imparted this fact to my Baptist friends. They\r\nmade all manner of fun ever afterward of the soothing nature of Mr.\r\nParker's theology, and my long walk, every Sunday, to repose in the\r\nshadow of a heterodox altar. Still, the loss of the sermon was the only\r\nvexatious part of it, and I had the benefit of the walk and the\r\nrefreshing slumber, to the music of Mr. Parker's melodious voice and the\r\ndeep-toned organ.\r\n\r\nMrs. Oliver Johnson and I spent two days at the Brook Farm Community\r\nwhen in the height of its prosperity. There I met the Ripleys,--who\r\nwere, I believe, the backbone of the experiment,--William Henry\r\nChanning, Bronson Alcott, Charles A. Dana, Frederick Cabot, William\r\nChase, Mrs. Horace Greeley, who was spending a few days there, and many\r\nothers, whose names I cannot recall. Here was a charming family of\r\nintelligent men and women, doing their own farm and house work, with\r\nlectures, readings, music, dancing, and games when desired; realizing,\r\nin a measure, Edward Bellamy's beautiful vision of the equal conditions\r\nof the human family in the year 2000. The story of the beginning and end\r\nof this experiment of community life has been told so often that I will\r\nsimply say that its failure was a grave disappointment to those most\r\ndeeply interested in its success. Mr. Channing told me, years after,\r\nwhen he was pastor of the Unitarian church in Rochester, as we were\r\nwandering through Mount Hope one day, that, when the Roxbury community\r\nwas dissolved and he was obliged to return to the old life of\r\ncompetition, he would gladly have been laid under the sod, as the\r\nisolated home seemed so solitary, silent, and selfish that the whole\r\natmosphere was oppressive.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 my father moved to Albany, to establish my brothers-in-law, Mr.\r\nWilkeson and Mr. McMartin, in the legal profession. That made Albany the\r\nfamily rallying point for a few years. This enabled me to spend several\r\nwinters at the Capital and to take an active part in the discussion of\r\nthe Married Woman's Property Bill, then pending in the legislature.\r\nWilliam H. Seward, Governor of the State from 1839 to 1843, recommended\r\nthe Bill, and his wife, a woman of rare intelligence, advocated it in\r\nsociety. Together we had the opportunity of talking with many members,\r\nboth of the Senate and the Assembly, in social circles, as well as in\r\ntheir committee rooms. Bills were pending from 1836 until 1848, when the\r\nmeasure finally passed.\r\n\r\nMy second son was born in Albany, in March, 1844, under more favorable\r\nauspices than the first, as I knew, then, what to do with a baby.\r\nReturning to Chelsea we commenced housekeeping, which afforded me\r\nanother chapter of experience. A new house, newly furnished, with\r\nbeautiful views of Boston Bay, was all I could desire. Mr. Stanton\r\nannounced to me, in starting, that his business would occupy all his\r\ntime, and that I must take entire charge of the housekeeping. So, with\r\ntwo good servants and two babies under my sole supervision, my time was\r\npleasantly occupied.\r\n\r\nWhen first installed as mistress over an establishment, one has that\r\nsame feeling of pride and satisfaction that a young minister must have\r\nin taking charge of his first congregation. It is a proud moment in a\r\nwoman's life to reign supreme within four walls, to be the one to whom\r\nall questions of domestic pleasure and economy are referred, and to hold\r\nin her hand that little family book in which the daily expenses, the\r\noutgoings and incomings, are duly registered. I studied up everything\r\npertaining to housekeeping, and enjoyed it all. Even washing day--that\r\nday so many people dread--had its charms for me. The clean clothes on\r\nthe lines and on the grass looked so white, and smelled so sweet, that\r\nit was to me a pretty sight to contemplate. I inspired my laundress with\r\nan ambition to have her clothes look white and to get them out earlier\r\nthan our neighbors, and to have them ironed and put away sooner.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Stanton did not come home to dinner, we made a picnic of our noon\r\nmeal on Mondays, and all thoughts and energies were turned to speed the\r\nwashing. No unnecessary sweeping or dusting, no visiting nor\r\nentertaining angels unawares on that day--it was held sacred to soap\r\nsuds, blue-bags, and clotheslines. The children, only, had no deviation\r\nin the regularity of their lives. They had their drives and walks,\r\ntheir naps and rations, in quantity and time, as usual. I had all the\r\nmost approved cook books, and spent half my time preserving, pickling,\r\nand experimenting in new dishes. I felt the same ambition to excel in\r\nall departments of the culinary art that I did at school in the\r\ndifferent branches of learning. My love of order and cleanliness was\r\ncarried throughout, from parlor to kitchen, from the front door to the\r\nback. I gave a man an extra shilling to pile the logs of firewood with\r\ntheir smooth ends outward, though I did not have them scoured white, as\r\ndid our Dutch grandmothers. I tried, too, to give an artistic touch to\r\neverything--the dress of my children and servants included. My dining\r\ntable was round, always covered with a clean cloth of a pretty pattern\r\nand a centerpiece of flowers in their season, pretty dishes, clean\r\nsilver, and set with neatness and care. I put my soul into everything,\r\nand hence enjoyed it. I never could understand how housekeepers could\r\nrest with rubbish all round their back doors; eggshells, broken dishes,\r\ntin cans, and old shoes scattered round their premises; servants ragged\r\nand dirty, with their hair in papers, and with the kitchen and dining\r\nroom full of flies. I have known even artists to be indifferent to their\r\npersonal appearance and their surroundings. Surely a mother and child,\r\ntastefully dressed, and a pretty home for a framework, is, as a picture,\r\neven more attractive than a domestic scene hung on the wall. The love of\r\nthe beautiful can be illustrated as well in life as on canvas. There is\r\nsuch a struggle among women to become artists that I really wish some of\r\ntheir gifts could be illustrated in clean, orderly, beautiful homes.\r\n\r\nOur house was pleasantly situated on the Chelsea Hills, commanding a\r\nfine view of Boston, the harbor, and surrounding country. There, on the\r\nupper piazza, I spent some of the happiest days of my life, enjoying, in\r\nturn, the beautiful outlook, my children, and my books. Here, under the\r\nvery shadow of Bunker Hill Monument, my third son was born. Shortly\r\nafter this Gerrit Smith and his wife came to spend a few days with us,\r\nso this boy, much against my will, was named after my cousin. I did not\r\nbelieve in old family names unless they were peculiarly euphonious. I\r\nhad a list of beautiful names for sons and daughters, from which to\r\ndesignate each newcomer; but, as yet, not one on my list had been used.\r\nHowever, I put my foot down, at No. 4, and named him Theodore, and, thus\r\nfar, he has proved himself a veritable \"gift of God,\" doing his\r\nuttermost, in every way possible, to fight the battle of freedom for\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nDuring the visit of my cousin I thought I would venture on a small,\r\nselect dinner party, consisting of the Rev. John Pierpont and his wife,\r\nCharles Sumner, John G. Whittier, and Joshua Leavitt. I had a new cook,\r\nRose, whose viands, thus far, had proved delicious, so I had no anxiety\r\non that score. But, unfortunately, on this occasion I had given her a\r\nbottle of wine for the pudding sauce and whipped cream, of which she\r\nimbibed too freely, and hence there were some glaring blunders in the\r\n_menu_ that were exceedingly mortifying. As Mr. Smith and my husband\r\nwere both good talkers, I told them they must cover all defects with\r\ntheir brilliant conversation, which they promised to do.\r\n\r\nRose had all the points of a good servant, phrenologically and\r\nphysiologically. She had a large head, with great bumps of caution and\r\norder, her eyes were large and soft and far apart. In selecting her,\r\nscientifically, I had told my husband, in triumph, several times what a\r\ntreasure I had found. Shortly after dinner, one evening when I was out,\r\nshe held the baby while the nurse was eating her supper, and carelessly\r\nburned his foot against the stove. Then Mr. Stanton suggested that, in\r\nselecting the next cook, I would better not trust to science, but\r\ninquire of the family where she lived as to her practical virtues. Poor\r\nRose! she wept over her lapses when sober, and made fair promises for\r\nthe future, but I did not dare to trust her, so we parted. The one\r\ndrawback to the joys of housekeeping was then, as it is now, the lack of\r\nfaithful, competent servants. The hope of co-operative housekeeping, in\r\nthe near future, gives us some promise of a more harmonious domestic\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nOne of the books in my library I value most highly is the first volume\r\nof Whittier's poems, published in 1838, \"Dedicated to Henry B. Stanton,\r\nas a token of the author's personal friendship, and of his respect for\r\nthe unreserved devotion of exalted talents to the cause of humanity and\r\nfreedom.\" Soon after our marriage we spent a few days with our gifted\r\nQuaker poet, on his farm in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget those happy days in June; the long walks and\r\ndrives, and talks under the old trees of anti-slavery experiences, and\r\nWhittier's mirth and indignation as we described different scenes in the\r\nWorld's Anti-slavery Convention in London. He laughed immoderately at\r\nthe Tom Campbell episode. Poor fellow! he had taken too much wine that\r\nday, and when Whittier's verses, addressed to the convention, were\r\nread, he criticised them severely, and wound up by saying that the soul\r\nof a poet was not in him. Mr. Stanton sprang to his feet and recited\r\nsome of Whittier's stirring stanzas on freedom, which electrified the\r\naudience, and, turning to Campbell, he said: \"What do you say to that?\"\r\n\"Ah! that's real poetry,\" he replied. \"And John Greenleaf Whittier is\r\nits author,\" said Mr. Stanton.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed, too, the morning and evening service, when the revered mother\r\nread the Scriptures and we all bowed our heads in silent worship. There\r\nwas, at times, an atmosphere of solemnity pervading everything, that was\r\noppressive in the midst of so much that appealed to my higher nature.\r\nThere was a shade of sadness in even the smile of the mother and sister,\r\nand a rigid plainness in the house and its surroundings, a depressed\r\nlook in Whittier himself that the songs of the birds, the sunshine, and\r\nthe bracing New England air seemed powerless to chase away, caused, as I\r\nafterward heard, by pecuniary embarrassment, and fears in regard to the\r\ndelicate health of the sister. She, too, had rare poetical talent, and\r\nin her Whittier found not only a helpful companion in the practical\r\naffairs of life, but one who sympathized with him in the highest flights\r\nof which his muse was capable. Their worst fears were realized in the\r\ndeath of the sister not long after. In his last volume several of her\r\npoems were published, which are quite worthy the place the brother's\r\nappreciation has given them. Whittier's love and reverence for his\r\nmother and sister, so marked in every word and look, were charming\r\nfeatures of his home life. All his poems to our sex breathe the same\r\ntender, worshipful sentiments.\r\n\r\nSoon after this visit at Amesbury, our noble friend spent a few days\r\nwith us in Chelsea, near Boston. One evening, after we had been talking\r\na long time of the unhappy dissensions among anti-slavery friends, by\r\nway of dissipating the shadows I opened the piano, and proposed that we\r\nshould sing some cheerful songs. \"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Mr. Stanton, \"do\r\nnot touch a note; you will put every nerve of Whittier's body on edge.\"\r\nIt seemed, to me, so natural for a poet to love music that I was\r\nsurprised to know that it was a torture to him.\r\n\r\nFrom our upper piazza we had a fine view of Boston harbor. Sitting there\r\nlate one moonlight night, admiring the outlines of Bunker Hill Monument\r\nand the weird effect of the sails and masts of the vessels lying in the\r\nharbor, we naturally passed from the romance of our surroundings to\r\nthose of our lives. I have often noticed that the most reserved people\r\nare apt to grow confidential at such an hour. It was under such\r\ncircumstances that the good poet opened to me a deeply interesting page\r\nof his life, a sad romance of love and disappointment, that may not yet\r\nbe told, as some who were interested in the events are still among the\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nWhittier's poems were not only one of the most important factors in the\r\nanti-slavery war and victory, but they have been equally potent in\r\nemancipating the minds of his generation from the gloomy superstitions\r\nof the puritanical religion. Oliver Wendell Holmes, in his eulogy of\r\nWhittier, says that his influence on the religious thought of the\r\nAmerican people has been far greater than that of the occupant of any\r\npulpit.\r\n\r\nAs my husband's health was delicate, and the New England winters proved\r\ntoo severe for him, we left Boston, with many regrets, and sought a more\r\ngenial climate in Central New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1847 we moved to Seneca Falls. Here we spent sixteen\r\nyears of our married life, and here our other children--two sons and two\r\ndaughters--were born.\r\n\r\nJust as we were ready to leave Boston, Mr. and Mrs. Eaton and their two\r\nchildren arrived from Europe, and we decided to go together to\r\nJohnstown, Mr. Eaton being obliged to hurry to New York on business, and\r\nMr. Stanton to remain still in Boston a few months. At the last moment\r\nmy nurse decided she could not leave her friends and go so far away.\r\nAccordingly my sister and I started, by rail, with five children and\r\nseventeen trunks, for Albany, where we rested over night and part of the\r\nnext day. We had a very fatiguing journey, looking after so many trunks\r\nand children, for my sister's children persisted in standing on the\r\nplatform at every opportunity, and the younger ones would follow their\r\nexample. This kept us constantly on the watch. We were thankful when\r\nsafely landed once more in the old homestead in Johnstown, where we\r\narrived at midnight. As our beloved parents had received no warning of\r\nour coming, the whole household was aroused to dispose of us. But now in\r\nsafe harbor, 'mid familiar scenes and pleasant memories, our slumbers\r\nwere indeed refreshing. How rapidly one throws off all care and anxiety\r\nunder the parental roof, and how at sea one feels, no matter what the\r\nage may be, when the loved ones are gone forever and the home of\r\nchildhood is but a dream of the past.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days of rest I started, alone, for my new home, quite happy\r\nwith the responsibility of repairing a house and putting all things in\r\norder. I was already acquainted with many of the people and the\r\nsurroundings in Seneca Falls, as my sister, Mrs. Bayard, had lived there\r\nseveral years, and I had frequently made her long visits. We had quite a\r\nmagnetic circle of reformers, too, in central New York. At Rochester\r\nwere William Henry Channing, Frederick Douglass, the Anthonys, Posts,\r\nHallowells, Stebbins,--some grand old Quaker families at\r\nFarmington,--the Sedgwicks, Mays, Mills, and Matilda Joslyn Gage at\r\nSyracuse; Gerrit Smith at Peterboro, and Beriah Green at Whitesboro.\r\n\r\nThe house we were to occupy had been closed for some years and needed\r\nmany repairs, and the grounds, comprising five acres, were overgrown\r\nwith weeds. My father gave me a check and said, with a smile, \"You\r\nbelieve in woman's capacity to do and dare; now go ahead and put your\r\nplace in order.\" After a minute survey of the premises and due\r\nconsultation with one or two sons of Adam, I set the carpenters,\r\npainters, paper-hangers, and gardeners at work, built a new kitchen and\r\nwoodhouse, and in one month took possession. Having left my children\r\nwith my mother, there were no impediments to a full display of my\r\nexecutive ability. In the purchase of brick, timber, paint, etc., and in\r\nmaking bargains with workmen, I was in frequent consultation with Judge\r\nSackett and Mr. Bascom. The latter was a member of the Constitutional\r\nConvention, then in session in Albany, and as he used to walk down\r\nwhenever he was at home, to see how my work progressed, we had long\r\ntalks, sitting on boxes in the midst of tools and shavings, on the\r\nstatus of women. I urged him to propose an amendment to Article II,\r\nSection 3, of the State Constitution, striking out the word \"male,\"\r\nwhich limits the suffrage to men. But, while he fully agreed with all I\r\nhad to say on the political equality of women, he had not the courage to\r\nmake himself the laughing-stock of the convention. Whenever I cornered\r\nhim on this point, manlike he turned the conversation to the painters\r\nand carpenters. However, these conversations had the effect of bringing\r\nhim into the first woman's convention, where he did us good service.\r\n\r\nIn Seneca Falls my life was comparatively solitary, and the change from\r\nBoston was somewhat depressing. There, all my immediate friends were\r\nreformers, I had near neighbors, a new home with all the modern\r\nconveniences, and well-trained servants. Here our residence was on the\r\noutskirts of the town, roads very often muddy and no sidewalks most of\r\nthe way, Mr. Stanton was frequently from home, I had poor servants, and\r\nan increasing number of children. To keep a house and grounds in good\r\norder, purchase every article for daily use, keep the wardrobes of half\r\na dozen human beings in proper trim, take the children to dentists,\r\nshoemakers, and different schools, or find teachers at home, altogether\r\nmade sufficient work to keep one brain busy, as well as all the hands I\r\ncould impress into the service. Then, too, the novelty of housekeeping\r\nhad passed away, and much that was once attractive in domestic life was\r\nnow irksome. I had so many cares that the company I needed for\r\nintellectual stimulus was a trial rather than a pleasure.\r\n\r\nThere was quite an Irish settlement at a short distance, and continual\r\ncomplaints were coming to me that my boys threw stones at their pigs,\r\ncows, and the roofs of their houses. This involved constant diplomatic\r\nrelations in the settlement of various difficulties, in which I was so\r\nsuccessful that, at length, they constituted me a kind of umpire in all\r\ntheir own quarrels. If a drunken husband was pounding his wife, the\r\nchildren would run for me. Hastening to the scene of action, I would\r\ntake Patrick by the collar, and, much to his surprise and shame, make\r\nhim sit down and promise to behave himself. I never had one of them\r\noffer the least resistance, and in time they all came to regard me as\r\none having authority. I strengthened my influence by cultivating good\r\nfeeling. I lent the men papers to read, and invited their children into\r\nour grounds; giving them fruit, of which we had abundance, and my\r\nchildren's old clothes, books, and toys. I was their physician,\r\nalso--with my box of homeopathic medicines I took charge of the men,\r\nwomen, and children in sickness. Thus the most amicable relations were\r\nestablished, and, in any emergency, these poor neighbors were good\r\nfriends and always ready to serve me.\r\n\r\nBut I found police duty rather irksome, especially when called out dark\r\nnights to prevent drunken fathers from disturbing their sleeping\r\nchildren, or to minister to poor mothers in the pangs of maternity.\r\nAlas! alas! who can measure the mountains of sorrow and suffering\r\nendured in unwelcome motherhood in the abodes of ignorance, poverty,\r\nand vice, where terror-stricken women and children are the victims of\r\nstrong men frenzied with passion and intoxicating drink?\r\n\r\nUp to this time life had glided by with comparative ease, but now the\r\nreal struggle was upon me. My duties were too numerous and varied, and\r\nnone sufficiently exhilarating or intellectual to bring into play my\r\nhigher faculties. I suffered with mental hunger, which, like an empty\r\nstomach, is very depressing. I had books, but no stimulating\r\ncompanionship. To add to my general dissatisfaction at the change from\r\nBoston, I found that Seneca Falls was a malarial region, and in due time\r\nall the children were attacked with chills and fever which, under\r\nhomeopathic treatment in those days, lasted three months. The servants\r\nwere afflicted in the same way. Cleanliness, order, the love of the\r\nbeautiful and artistic, all faded away in the struggle to accomplish\r\nwhat was absolutely necessary from hour to hour. Now I understood, as I\r\nnever had before, how women could sit down and rest in the midst of\r\ngeneral disorder. Housekeeping, under such conditions, was impossible,\r\nso I packed our clothes, locked up the house, and went to that harbor of\r\nsafety, home, as I did ever after in stress of weather.\r\n\r\nI now fully understood the practical difficulties most women had to\r\ncontend with in the isolated household, and the impossibility of woman's\r\nbest development if in contact, the chief part of her life, with\r\nservants and children. Fourier's phalansterie community life and\r\nco-operative households had a new significance for me. Emerson says, \"A\r\nhealthy discontent is the first step to progress.\" The general\r\ndiscontent I felt with woman's portion as wife, mother, housekeeper,\r\nphysician, and spiritual guide, the chaotic conditions into which\r\neverything fell without her constant supervision, and the wearied,\r\nanxious look of the majority of women impressed me with a strong feeling\r\nthat some active measures should be taken to remedy the wrongs of\r\nsociety in general, and of women in particular. My experience at the\r\nWorld's Anti-slavery Convention, all I had read of the legal status of\r\nwomen, and the oppression I saw everywhere, together swept across my\r\nsoul, intensified now by many personal experiences. It seemed as if all\r\nthe elements had conspired to impel me to some onward step. I could not\r\nsee what to do or where to begin--my only thought was a public meeting\r\nfor protest and discussion.\r\n\r\nIn this tempest-tossed condition of mind I received an invitation to\r\nspend the day with Lucretia Mott, at Richard Hunt's, in Waterloo. There\r\nI met several members of different families of Friends, earnest,\r\nthoughtful women. I poured out, that day, the torrent of my\r\nlong-accumulating discontent, with such vehemence and indignation that I\r\nstirred myself, as well as the rest of the party, to do and dare\r\nanything. My discontent, according to Emerson, must have been healthy,\r\nfor it moved us all to prompt action, and we decided, then and there, to\r\ncall a \"Woman's Rights Convention.\" We wrote the call that evening and\r\npublished it in the _Seneca County Courier_ the next day, the 14th of\r\nJuly, 1848, giving only five days' notice, as the convention was to be\r\nheld on the 19th and 20th. The call was inserted without signatures,--in\r\nfact it was a mere announcement of a meeting,--but the chief movers and\r\nmanagers were Lucretia Mott, Mary Ann McClintock, Jane Hunt, Martha C.\r\nWright, and myself. The convention, which was held two days in the\r\nMethodist Church, was in every way a grand success. The house was\r\ncrowded at every session, the speaking good, and a religious earnestness\r\ndignified all the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThese were the hasty initiative steps of \"the most momentous reform that\r\nhad yet been launched on the world--the first organized protest against\r\nthe injustice which had brooded for ages over the character and destiny\r\nof one-half the race.\" No words could express our astonishment on\r\nfinding, a few days afterward, that what seemed to us so timely, so\r\nrational, and so sacred, should be a subject for sarcasm and ridicule to\r\nthe entire press of the nation. With our Declaration of Rights and\r\nResolutions for a text, it seemed as if every man who could wield a pen\r\nprepared a homily on \"woman's sphere.\" All the journals from Maine to\r\nTexas seemed to strive with each other to see which could make our\r\nmovement appear the most ridiculous. The anti-slavery papers stood by us\r\nmanfully and so did Frederick Douglass, both in the convention and in\r\nhis paper, _The North Star_, but so pronounced was the popular voice\r\nagainst us, in the parlor, press, and pulpit, that most of the ladies\r\nwho had attended the convention and signed the declaration, one by one,\r\nwithdrew their names and influence and joined our persecutors. Our\r\nfriends gave us the cold shoulder and felt themselves disgraced by the\r\nwhole proceeding.\r\n\r\nIf I had had the slightest premonition of all that was to follow that\r\nconvention, I fear I should not have had the courage to risk it, and I\r\nmust confess that it was with fear and trembling that I consented to\r\nattend another, one month afterward, in Rochester. Fortunately, the\r\nfirst one seemed to have drawn all the fire, and of the second but\r\nlittle was said. But we had set the ball in motion, and now, in quick\r\nsuccession, conventions were held in Ohio, Indiana, Massachusetts,\r\nPennsylvania, and in the City of New York, and have been kept up nearly\r\nevery year since.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy of the early conventions were those held in\r\nMassachusetts, in which such men as Garrison, Phillips, Channing,\r\nParker, and Emerson took part. It was one of these that first attracted\r\nthe attention of Mrs. John Stuart Mill, and drew from her pen that able\r\narticle on \"The Enfranchisement of Woman,\" in the _Westminster Review_\r\nof October, 1852.\r\n\r\nThe same year of the convention, the Married Woman's Property Bill,\r\nwhich had given rise to some discussion on woman's rights in New York,\r\nhad passed the legislature. This encouraged action on the part of women,\r\nas the reflection naturally arose that, if the men who make the laws\r\nwere ready for some onward step, surely the women themselves should\r\nexpress some interest in the legislation. Ernestine L. Rose, Paulina\r\nWright (Davis), and I had spoken before committees of the legislature\r\nyears before, demanding equal property rights for women. We had\r\ncirculated petitions for the Married Woman's Property Bill for many\r\nyears, and so also had the leaders of the Dutch aristocracy, who desired\r\nto see their life-long accumulations descend to their daughters and\r\ngrandchildren rather than pass into the hands of dissipated, thriftless\r\nsons-in-law. Judge Hertell, Judge Fine, and Mr. Geddes of Syracuse\r\nprepared and championed the several bills, at different times, before\r\nthe legislature. Hence the demands made in the convention were not\r\nentirely new to the reading and thinking public of New York--the first\r\nState to take any action on the question. As New York was the first\r\nState to put the word \"male\" in her constitution in 1778, it was fitting\r\nthat she should be first in more liberal legislation. The effect of the\r\nconvention on my own mind was most salutary. The discussions had cleared\r\nmy ideas as to the primal steps to be taken for woman's enfranchisement,\r\nand the opportunity of expressing myself fully and freely on a subject I\r\nfelt so deeply about was a great relief. I think all women who attended\r\nthe convention felt better for the statement of their wrongs, believing\r\nthat the first step had been taken to right them.\r\n\r\nSoon after this I was invited to speak at several points in the\r\nneighborhood. One night, in the Quaker Meeting House at Farmington, I\r\ninvited, as usual, discussion and questions when I had finished. We all\r\nwaited in silence for a long time; at length a middle-aged man, with a\r\nbroad-brimmed hat, arose and responded in a sing-song tone: \"All I have\r\nto say is, if a hen can crow, let her crow,\" emphasizing \"crow\" with an\r\nupward inflection on several notes of the gamut. The meeting adjourned\r\nwith mingled feelings of surprise and merriment. I confess that I felt\r\nsomewhat chagrined in having what I considered my unanswerable arguments\r\nso summarily disposed of, and the serious impression I had made on the\r\naudience so speedily dissipated. The good man intended no disrespect, as\r\nhe told me afterward. He simply put the whole argument in a nutshell:\r\n\"Let a woman do whatever she can.\"\r\n\r\nWith these new duties and interests, and a broader outlook on human\r\nlife, my petty domestic annoyances gradually took a subordinate place.\r\nNow I began to write articles for the press, letters to conventions held\r\nin other States, and private letters to friends, to arouse them to\r\nthought on this question.\r\n\r\nThe pastor of the Presbyterian Church, Mr. Bogue, preached several\r\nsermons on Woman's Sphere, criticising the action of the conventions in\r\nSeneca Falls and Rochester. Elizabeth McClintock and I took notes and\r\nanswered him in the county papers. Gradually we extended our labors and\r\nattacked our opponents in the New York _Tribune_, whose columns were\r\nopen to us in the early days, Mr. Greeley being, at that time, one of\r\nour most faithful champions.\r\n\r\nIn answering all the attacks, we were compelled to study canon and civil\r\nlaw, constitutions, Bibles, science, philosophy, and history, sacred and\r\nprofane. Now my mind, as well as my hands, was fully occupied, and\r\ninstead of mourning, as I had done, over what I had lost in leaving\r\nBoston, I tried in every way to make the most of life in Seneca Falls.\r\nSeeing that elaborate refreshments prevented many social gatherings, I\r\noften gave an evening entertainment without any. I told the young\r\npeople, whenever they wanted a little dance or a merry time, to make our\r\nhouse their rallying point, and I would light up and give them a glass\r\nof water and some cake. In that way we had many pleasant informal\r\ngatherings. Then, in imitation of Margaret Fuller's Conversationals, we\r\nstarted one which lasted several years. We selected a subject each week\r\non which we all read and thought; each, in turn, preparing an essay ten\r\nminutes in length.\r\n\r\nThese were held, at different homes, Saturday of each week. On coming\r\ntogether we chose a presiding officer for the evening, who called the\r\nmeeting to order, and introduced the essayist. That finished, he asked\r\neach member, in turn, what he or she had read or thought on the subject,\r\nand if any had criticisms to make on the essay. Everyone was expected to\r\ncontribute something. Much information was thus gained, and many spicy\r\ndiscussions followed. All the ladies, as well as the gentlemen, presided\r\nin turn, and so became familiar with parliamentary rules. The evening\r\nended with music, dancing, and a general chat. In this way we read and\r\nthought over a wide range of subjects and brought together the best\r\nminds in the community. Many young men and women who did not belong to\r\nwhat was considered the first circle,--for in every little country\r\nvillage there is always a small clique that constitutes the\r\naristocracy,--had the advantages of a social life otherwise denied them.\r\nI think that all who took part in this Conversation Club would testify\r\nto its many good influences.\r\n\r\nI had three quite intimate young friends in the village who spent much\r\nof their spare time with me, and who added much to my happiness: Frances\r\nHoskins, who was principal of the girls' department in the academy, with\r\nwhom I discussed politics and religion; Mary Bascom, a good talker on\r\nthe topics of the day, and Mary Crowninshield, who played well on the\r\npiano. As I was very fond of music, Mary's coming was always hailed with\r\ndelight. Her mother, too, was a dear friend of mine, a woman of rare\r\nintelligence, refinement, and conversational talent. She was a Schuyler,\r\nand belonged to the Dutch aristocracy in Albany. She died suddenly,\r\nafter a short illness. I was with her in the last hours and held her\r\nhand until the gradually fading spark of life went out. Her son is\r\nCaptain A.S. Crowninshield of our Navy.\r\n\r\nMy nearest neighbors were a very agreeable, intelligent family of sons\r\nand daughters. But I always felt that the men of that household were\r\ngiven to domineering. As the mother was very amiable and\r\nself-sacrificing, the daughters found it difficult to rebel. One summer,\r\nafter general house-cleaning, when fresh paint and paper had made even\r\nthe kitchen look too dainty for the summer invasion of flies, the queens\r\nof the household decided to move the sombre cook-stove into a spacious\r\nwoodhouse, where it maintained its dignity one week, in the absence of\r\nthe head of the home. The mother and daughters were delighted with the\r\nchange, and wondered why they had not made it before during the summer\r\nmonths. But their pleasure was shortlived. Father and sons rose early\r\nthe first morning after his return and moved the stove back to its old\r\nplace. When the wife and daughters came down to get their breakfast (for\r\nthey did all their own work) they were filled with grief and\r\ndisappointment. The breakfast was eaten in silence, the women humbled\r\nwith a sense of their helplessness, and the men gratified with a sense\r\nof their power. These men would probably all have said \"home is woman's\r\nsphere,\" though they took the liberty of regulating everything in her\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. STANTON AND SON, 1854.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Susan B. Anthony 1820-Feb. 15, 1858--]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSUSAN B. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reports of the conventions held in Seneca Falls and Rochester, N.Y.,\r\nin 1848, attracted the attention of one destined to take a most\r\nimportant part in the new movement--Susan B. Anthony, who, for her\r\ncourage and executive ability, was facetiously called by William Henry\r\nChanning, the Napoleon of our struggle. At this time she was teaching in\r\nthe academy at Canajoharie, a little village in the beautiful valley of\r\nthe Mohawk.\r\n\r\n\"The Woman's Declaration of Independence\" issued from those conventions\r\nstartled and amused her, and she laughed heartily at the novelty and\r\npresumption of the demand. But, on returning home to spend her vacation,\r\nshe was surprised to find that her sober Quaker parents and sister,\r\nhaving attended the Rochester meetings, regarded them as very profitable\r\nand interesting, and the demands made as proper and reasonable. She was\r\nalready interested in the anti-slavery and temperance reforms, was an\r\nactive member of an organization called \"The Daughters of Temperance,\"\r\nand had spoken a few times in their public meetings. But the new gospel\r\nof \"Woman's Rights,\" found a ready response in her mind, and, from that\r\ntime, her best efforts have been given to the enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\nAs, from this time, my friend is closely connected with my narrative\r\nand will frequently appear therein, a sketch of her seems appropriate.\r\n\r\nLord Bacon has well said: \"He that hath wife and children hath given\r\nhostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great enterprises\r\neither of virtue or mischief. Certainly the best works, and of greatest\r\nmerit for the public, have proceeded from the unmarried or childless\r\nmen; which, both in affection and means, have married and endowed the\r\npublic.\"\r\n\r\nThis bit of Baconian philosophy, as alike applicable to women, was the\r\nsubject, not long since, of a conversation with a remarkably gifted\r\nEnglishwoman. She was absorbed in many public interests and had\r\nconscientiously resolved never to marry, lest the cares necessarily\r\ninvolved in matrimony should make inroads upon her time and thought, to\r\nthe detriment of the public good. \"Unless,\" said she, \"some women\r\ndedicate themselves to the public service, society is robbed of needed\r\nguardians for the special wants of the weak and unfortunate. There\r\nshould be, in the secular world, certain orders corresponding in a\r\nmeasure to the grand sisterhoods of the Catholic Church, to the members\r\nof which, as freely as to men, all offices, civic and ecclesiastical,\r\nshould be open.\" That this ideal will be realized may be inferred from\r\nthe fact that exceptional women have, in all ages, been leaders in great\r\nprojects of charity and reform, and that now many stand waiting only the\r\nsanction of their century, ready for wide altruistic labors.\r\n\r\nThe world has ever had its vestal virgins, its holy women, mothers of\r\nideas rather than of men; its Marys, as well as its Marthas, who, rather\r\nthan be busy housewives, preferred to sit at the feet of divine wisdom,\r\nand ponder the mysteries of the unknown. All hail to Maria Mitchell,\r\nHarriet Hosmer, Charlotte Cushman, Alice and Phoebe Gary, Louisa Alcott,\r\nDr. Elizabeth Blackwell, Frances Willard, and Clara Barton! All honor to\r\nthe noble women who have devoted earnest lives to the intellectual and\r\nmoral needs of mankind!\r\n\r\nSusan B. Anthony was of sturdy New England stock, and it was at the foot\r\nof Old Greylock, South Adams, Mass., that she gave forth her first\r\nrebellious cry. There the baby steps were taken, and at the village\r\nschool the first stitches were learned, and the A B C duly mastered.\r\nWhen five winters had passed over Susan's head, there came a time of\r\ngreat domestic commotion, and, in her small way, the child seized the\r\nidea that permanence is not the rule of life. The family moved to\r\nBattenville, N.Y., where Mr. Anthony became one of the wealthiest men in\r\nWashington County. Susan can still recall the stately coldness of the\r\ngreat house--how large the bare rooms, with their yellow-painted floors,\r\nseemed, in contrast with her own diminutiveness, and the outlook of the\r\nschoolroom where for so many years, with her brothers and sisters, she\r\npursued her studies under private tutors.\r\n\r\nMr. Anthony was a stern Hicksite Quaker. In Susan's early life he\r\nobjected on principle to all forms of frivolous amusement, such as\r\nmusic, dancing, or novel reading, while games and even pictures were\r\nregarded as meaningless luxuries. Such puritanical convictions might\r\nhave easily degenerated into mere cant; but underlying all was a broad\r\nand firm basis of wholesome respect for individual freedom and a brave\r\nadherence to truth. He was a man of good business capacity, and a\r\nthorough manager of his wide and lucrative interests. He saw that\r\ncompensation and not chance ruled in the commercial world, and he\r\nbelieved in the same just, though often severe, law in the sphere of\r\nmorals. Such a man was not apt to walk humbly in the path mapped out by\r\nhis religious sect. He early offended by choosing a Baptist for a wife.\r\nFor this first offense he was \"disowned,\" and, according to Quaker\r\nusage, could only be received into fellowship again by declaring himself\r\n\"sorry\" for his crime in full meeting. He was full of devout\r\nthankfulness for the good woman by his side, and destined to be thankful\r\nto the very end for this companion, so calm, so just, so far-seeing. He\r\nrose in meeting, and said he was \"sorry\" that the rules of the society\r\nwere such that, in marrying the woman he loved, he had committed\r\noffense! He admitted that he was \"sorry\" for something, so was taken\r\nback into the body of the faithful! But his faith had begun to weaken in\r\nmany minor points of discipline. His coat soon became a cause of offense\r\nand called forth another reproof from those buttoned up in conforming\r\ngarments. The petty forms of Quakerism began to lose their weight with\r\nhim altogether, and he was finally disowned for allowing the village\r\nyouth to be taught dancing in an upper room of his dwelling. He was\r\napplied to for this favor on the ground that young men were under great\r\ntemptation to drink if the lessons were given in the hotel; and, being a\r\nrigid temperance man, he readily consented, though his principles, in\r\nregard to dancing, would not allow his own sons and daughters to join in\r\nthe amusement. But the society could accept no such discrimination in\r\nwhat it deemed sin, nor such compromise with worldly frivolity, and so\r\nMr. Anthony was seen no more in meeting. But, in later years, in\r\nRochester he was an attentive listener to Rev. William Henry Channing.\r\n\r\nThe effect of all this on Susan is the question of interest. No doubt\r\nshe early weighed the comparative moral effects of coats cut with capes\r\nand those cut without, of purely Quaker conjugal love and that\r\ndeteriorated with Baptist affection. Susan had an earnest soul and a\r\nconscience tending to morbidity; but a strong, well-balanced body and\r\nsimple family life soothed her too active moral nature and gave the\r\nworld, instead of a religious fanatic, a sincere, concentrated worker.\r\nEvery household art was taught her by her mother, and so great was her\r\nability that the duty demanding especial care was always given into her\r\nhands. But ever, amid school and household tasks, her day-dream was\r\nthat, in time, she might be a \"high-seat\" Quaker. Each Sunday, up to the\r\ntime of the third disobedience, Mr. Anthony went to the Quaker meeting\r\nhouse, some thirteen miles from home, his wife and children usually\r\naccompanying him, though, as non-members, they were rigidly excluded\r\nfrom all business discussions. Exclusion was very pleasant in the bright\r\ndays of summer; but, on one occasion in December, decidedly unpleasant\r\nfor the seven-year-old Susan. When the blinds were drawn, at the close\r\nof the religious meeting, and non-members retired, Susan sat still. Soon\r\nshe saw a thin old lady with blue goggles come down from the \"high\r\nseat.\" Approaching her, the Quakeress said softly, \"Thee is not a\r\nmember--thee must go out.\" \"No; my mother told me not to go out in the\r\ncold,\" was the child's firm response. \"Yes, but thee must go out--thee\r\nis not a member.\" \"But my father is a member.\" \"Thee is not a member,\"\r\nand Susan felt as if the spirit was moving her and soon found herself in\r\nouter coldness. Fingers and toes becoming numb, and a bright fire in a\r\ncottage over the way beckoning warmly to her, the exile from the chapel\r\nresolved to seek secular shelter. But alas! she was confronted by a huge\r\ndog, and just escaped with whole skin though capeless jacket. We may be\r\nsure there was much talk, that night, at the home fireside, and the good\r\nBaptist wife declared that no child of hers should attend meeting again\r\ntill made a member. Thereafter, by request of her father, Susan became a\r\nmember of the Quaker church.\r\n\r\nLater, definite convictions took root in Miss Anthony's heart. Hers is,\r\nindeed, a sincerely religious nature. To be a simple, earnest Quaker was\r\nthe aspiration of her girlhood; but she shrank from adopting the formal\r\nlanguage and plain dress. Dark hours of conflict were spent over all\r\nthis, and she interpreted her disinclination as evidence of\r\nunworthiness. Poor little Susan! As we look back with the knowledge of\r\nour later life, we translate the heart-burnings as unconscious protests\r\nagainst labeling your free soul, against testing your reasoning\r\nconviction of to-morrow by any shibboleth of to-day's belief. We hail\r\nthis child-intuition as a prophecy of the uncompromising truthfulness of\r\nthe mature woman. Susan Anthony was taught simply that she must enter\r\ninto the holy of holies of her own self, meet herself, and be true to\r\nthe revelation. She first found words to express her convictions in\r\nlistening to Rev. William Henry Channing, whose teaching had a lasting\r\nspiritual influence upon her. To-day Miss Anthony is an agnostic. As to\r\nthe nature of the Godhead and of the life beyond her horizon she does\r\nnot profess to know anything. Every energy of her soul is centered upon\r\nthe needs of this world. To her, work is worship. She has not stood\r\naside, shivering in the cold shadows of uncertainty, but has moved on\r\nwith the whirling world, has done the good given her to do, and thus, in\r\ndarkest hours, has been sustained by an unfaltering faith in the final\r\nperfection of all things. Her belief is not orthodox, but it is\r\nreligious. In ancient Greece she would have been a Stoic; in the era of\r\nthe Reformation, a Calvinist; in King Charles' time, a Puritan; but in\r\nthis nineteenth century, by the very laws of her being, she is a\r\nReformer.\r\n\r\nFor the arduous work that awaited Miss Anthony her years of young\r\nwomanhood had given preparation. Her father, though a man of wealth,\r\nmade it a matter of conscience to train his girls, as well as his boys,\r\nto self-support. Accordingly Susan chose the profession of teacher, and\r\nmade her first essay during a summer vacation in a school her father had\r\nestablished for the children of his employés. Her success was so marked,\r\nnot only in imparting knowledge, but also as a disciplinarian, that she\r\nfollowed this career steadily for fifteen years, with the exception of\r\nsome months given in Philadelphia to her own training. Of the many\r\nschool rebellions which she overcame, one rises before me, prominent in\r\nits ludicrous aspect. This was in the district school at Center Falls,\r\nin the year 1839. Bad reports were current there of male teachers driven\r\nout by a certain strapping lad. Rumor next told of a Quaker maiden\r\ncoming to teach--a Quaker maiden of peace principles. The anticipated\r\nday and Susan arrived. She looked very meek to the barbarian of fifteen,\r\nso he soon began his antics. He was called to the platform, told to lay\r\naside his jacket, and, thereupon, with much astonishment received from\r\nthe mild Quaker maiden, with a birch rod applied calmly but with\r\nprecision, an exposition of the _argumentum ad hominem_ based on the _a\r\nposteriori_ method of reasoning. Thus Susan departed from her\r\nprinciples, but not from the school.\r\n\r\nBut, before long, conflicts in the outside world disturbed our young\r\nteacher. The multiplication table and spelling book no longer enchained\r\nher thoughts; larger questions began to fill her mind. About the year\r\n1850 Susan B. Anthony hid her ferule away. Temperance, anti-slavery,\r\nwoman suffrage,--three pregnant questions,--presented themselves,\r\ndemanding her consideration. Higher, ever higher, rose their appeals,\r\nuntil she resolved to dedicate her energy and thought to the burning\r\nneeds of the hour. Owing to early experience of the disabilities of her\r\nsex, the first demand for equal rights for women found echo in Susan's\r\nheart. And, though she was in the beginning startled to hear that women\r\nhad actually met in convention, and by speeches and resolutions had\r\ndeclared themselves man's peer in political rights, and had urged\r\nradical changes in State constitutions and the whole system of American\r\njurisprudence; yet the most casual review convinced her that these\r\nclaims were but the logical outgrowth of the fundamental theories of our\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of her development I met my future friend and coadjutor\r\nfor the first time. How well I remember the day! George Thompson and\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison having announced an anti-slavery meeting in\r\nSeneca Falls, Miss Anthony came to attend it. These gentlemen were my\r\nguests. Walking home, after the adjournment, we met Mrs. Bloomer and\r\nMiss Anthony on the corner of the street, waiting to greet us. There she\r\nstood, with her good, earnest face and genial smile, dressed in gray\r\ndelaine, hat and all the same color, relieved with pale blue ribbons,\r\nthe perfection of neatness and sobriety. I liked her thoroughly, and why\r\nI did not at once invite her home with me to dinner, I do not know. She\r\naccuses me of that neglect, and has never forgiven me, as she wished to\r\nsee and hear all she could of our noble friends. I suppose my mind was\r\nfull of what I had heard, or my coming dinner, or the probable behavior\r\nof three mischievous boys who had been busily exploring the premises\r\nwhile I was at the meeting.\r\n\r\nThat I had abundant cause for anxiety in regard to the philosophical\r\nexperiments these young savages might try the reader will admit, when\r\ninformed of some of their performances. Henry imagined himself possessed\r\nof rare powers of invention (an ancestral weakness for generations), and\r\nso made a life preserver of corks, and tested its virtues on his\r\nbrother, who was about eighteen months old. Accompanied by a troop of\r\nexpectant boys, the baby was drawn in his carriage to the banks of the\r\nSeneca, stripped, the string of corks tied under his arms, and set\r\nafloat in the river, the philosopher and his satellites, in a rowboat,\r\nwatching the experiment. The baby, accustomed to a morning bath in a\r\nlarge tub, splashed about joyfully, keeping his head above water. He was\r\nas blue as indigo and as cold as a frog when rescued by his anxious\r\nmother. The next day the same victimized infant was seen, by a passing\r\nfriend, seated on the chimney, on the highest peak of the house. Without\r\nalarming anyone, the friend hurried up to the housetop and rescued the\r\nchild. Another time the three elder brothers entered into a conspiracy,\r\nand locked up the fourth, Theodore, in the smoke-house. Fortunately, he\r\nsounded the alarm loud and clear, and was set free in safety, whereupon\r\nthe three were imprisoned in a garret with two barred windows. They\r\nsummarily kicked out the bars, and, sliding down on the lightning rod,\r\nbetook themselves to the barn for liberty. The youngest boy, Gerrit,\r\nthen only five years old, skinned his hands in the descent. This is a\r\nfair sample of the quiet happiness I enjoyed in the first years of\r\nmotherhood.\r\n\r\nIt was 'mid such exhilarating scenes that Miss Anthony and I wrote\r\naddresses for temperance, anti-slavery, educational, and woman's rights\r\nconventions. Here we forged resolutions, protests, appeals, petitions,\r\nagricultural reports, and constitutional arguments; for we made it a\r\nmatter of conscience to accept every invitation to speak on every\r\nquestion, in order to maintain woman's right to do so. To this end we\r\ntook turns on the domestic watchtowers, directing amusements, settling\r\ndisputes, protecting the weak against the strong, and trying to secure\r\nequal rights to all in the home as well as the nation. I can recall many\r\na stern encounter between my friend and the young experimenter. It is\r\npleasant to remember that he never seriously injured any of his victims,\r\nand only once came near fatally shooting himself with a pistol. The ball\r\nwent through his hand; happily a brass button prevented it from\r\npenetrating his heart.\r\n\r\nIt is often said, by those who know Miss Anthony best, that she has been\r\nmy good angel, always pushing and goading me to work, and that but for\r\nher pertinacity I should never have accomplished the little I have. On\r\nthe other hand it has been said that I forged the thunderbolts and she\r\nfired them. Perhaps all this is, in a measure, true. With the cares of a\r\nlarge family I might, in time, like too many women, have become wholly\r\nabsorbed in a narrow family selfishness, had not my friend been\r\ncontinually exploring new fields for missionary labors. Her description\r\nof a body of men on any platform, complacently deciding questions in\r\nwhich woman had an equal interest, without an equal voice, readily\r\nroused me to a determination to throw a firebrand into the midst of\r\ntheir assembly.\r\n\r\nThus, whenever I saw that stately Quaker girl coming across my lawn, I\r\nknew that some happy convocation of the sons of Adam was to be set by\r\nthe ears, by one of our appeals or resolutions. The little portmanteau,\r\nstuffed with facts, was opened, and there we had what the Rev. John\r\nSmith and Hon. Richard Roe had said: false interpretations of Bible\r\ntexts, the statistics of women robbed of their property, shut out of\r\nsome college, half paid for their work, the reports of some disgraceful\r\ntrial; injustice enough to turn any woman's thoughts from stockings and\r\npuddings. Then we would get out our pens and write articles for papers,\r\nor a petition to the legislature; indite letters to the faithful, here\r\nand there; stir up the women in Ohio, Pennsylvania, or Massachusetts;\r\ncall on _The Lily, The Una, The Liberator, The Standard_ to remember our\r\nwrongs as well as those of the slave. We never met without issuing a\r\npronunciamento on some question. In thought and sympathy we were one,\r\nand in the division of labor we exactly complemented each other. In\r\nwriting we did better work than either could alone. While she is slow\r\nand analytical in composition, I am rapid and synthetic. I am the better\r\nwriter, she the better critic. She supplied the facts and statistics, I\r\nthe philosophy and rhetoric, and, together, we have made arguments that\r\nhave stood unshaken through the storms of long years; arguments that no\r\none has answered. Our speeches may be considered the united product of\r\nour two brains.\r\n\r\nSo entirely one are we that, in all our associations, ever side by side\r\non the same platform, not one feeling of envy or jealousy has ever\r\nshadowed our lives. We have indulged freely in criticism of each other\r\nwhen alone, and hotly contended whenever we have differed, but in our\r\nfriendship of years there has never been the break of one hour. To the\r\nworld we always seem to agree and uniformly reflect each other. Like\r\nhusband and wife, each has the feeling that we must have no differences\r\nin public. Thus united, at an early day we began to survey the state and\r\nnation, the future field of our labors. We read, with critical eyes, the\r\nproceedings of Congress and legislatures, of general assemblies and\r\nsynods, of conferences and conventions, and discovered that, in all\r\nalike, the existence of woman was entirely ignored.\r\n\r\nNight after night, by an old-fashioned fireplace, we plotted and planned\r\nthe coming agitation; how, when, and where each entering wedge could be\r\ndriven, by which women might be recognized and their rights secured.\r\nSpeedily the State was aflame with disturbances in temperance and\r\nteachers' conventions, and the press heralded the news far and near that\r\nwomen delegates had suddenly appeared, demanding admission in men's\r\nconventions; that their rights had been hotly contested session after\r\nsession, by liberal men on the one side, the clergy and learned\r\nprofessors on the other; an overwhelming majority rejecting the women\r\nwith terrible anathemas and denunciations. Such battles were fought over\r\nand over in the chief cities of many of the Northern States, until the\r\nbigotry of men in all the reforms and professions was thoroughly\r\nexposed. Every right achieved, to enter a college, to study a\r\nprofession, to labor in some new industry, or to advocate a reform\r\nmeasure was contended for inch by inch.\r\n\r\nMany of those enjoying all these blessings now complacently say, \"If\r\nthese pioneers in reform had only pressed their measures more\r\njudiciously, in a more ladylike manner, in more choice language, with a\r\nmore deferential attitude, the gentlemen could not have behaved so\r\nrudely.\" I give, in these pages, enough of the characteristics of these\r\nwomen, of the sentiments they expressed, of their education, ancestry,\r\nand position to show that no power could have met the prejudice and\r\nbigotry of that period more successfully than they did who so bravely\r\nand persistently fought and conquered them.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony first carried her flag of rebellion into the State\r\nconventions of teachers, and there fought, almost single-handed, the\r\nbattle for equality. At the close of the first decade she had compelled\r\nconservatism to yield its ground so far as to permit women to\r\nparticipate in all debates, deliver essays, vote, and hold honored\r\npositions as officers. She labored as sincerely in the temperance\r\nmovement, until convinced that woman's moral power amounted to little as\r\na civil agent, until backed by ballot and coined into State law. She\r\nstill never loses an occasion to defend co-education and prohibition,\r\nand solves every difficulty with the refrain, \"woman suffrage,\" as\r\npersistent as the \"never more\" of Poe's raven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSUSAN B. ANTHONY--_Continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in 1852 that anti-slavery, through the eloquent lips of such men\r\nas George Thompson, Phillips, and Garrison, first proclaimed to Miss\r\nAnthony its pressing financial necessities. To their inspired words she\r\ngave answer, four years afterward, by becoming a regularly employed\r\nagent in the Anti-slavery Society. For her espoused cause she has always\r\nmade boldest demands. In the abolition meetings she used to tell each\r\nclass why it should support the movement financially; invariably calling\r\nupon Democrats to give liberally, as the success of the cause would\r\nenable them to cease bowing the knee to the slave power.\r\n\r\nThere is scarce a town, however small, from New York to San Francisco,\r\nthat has not heard her ringing voice. Who can number the speeches she\r\nhas made on lyceum platforms, in churches, schoolhouses, halls, barns,\r\nand in the open air, with a lumber wagon or a cart for her rostrum? Who\r\ncan describe the varied audiences and social circles she has cheered and\r\ninterested? Now we see her on the far-off prairies, entertaining, with\r\nsterling common sense, large gatherings of men, women, and children,\r\nseated on rough boards in some unfinished building; again, holding\r\npublic debates in some town with half-fledged editors and clergymen;\r\nnext, sailing up the Columbia River and, in hot haste to meet some\r\nappointment, jolting over the rough mountains of Oregon and Washington;\r\nand then, before legislative assemblies, constitutional conventions, and\r\ncongressional committees, discussing with senators and judges the letter\r\nand spirit of constitutional law.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony's style of speaking is rapid and vehement. In debate she is\r\nready and keen, and she is always equal to an emergency. Many times in\r\ntraveling with her through the West, especially on our first trip to\r\nKansas and California, we were suddenly called upon to speak to the\r\nwomen assembled at the stations. Filled with consternation, I usually\r\nappealed to her to go first; and, without a moment's hesitation, she\r\ncould always fill five minutes with some appropriate words and inspire\r\nme with thoughts and courage to follow. The climax of these occasions\r\nwas reached in an institution for the deaf and dumb in Michigan. I had\r\njust said to my friend, \"There is one comfort in visiting this place; we\r\nshall not be asked to speak,\" when the superintendent, approaching us,\r\nsaid, \"Ladies, the pupils are assembled in the chapel, ready to hear\r\nyou. I promised to invite you to speak to them as soon as I heard you\r\nwere in town.\" The possibility of addressing such an audience was as\r\nnovel to Miss Anthony as to me; yet she promptly walked down the aisle\r\nto the platform, as if to perform an ordinary duty, while I, half\r\ndistracted with anxiety, wondering by what process I was to be placed in\r\ncommunication with the deaf and dumb, reluctantly followed. But the\r\nmanner was simple enough, when illustrated. The superintendent, standing\r\nby our side, repeated, in the sign language, what was said as fast as\r\nuttered; and by laughter, tears, and applause, the pupils showed that\r\nthey fully appreciated the pathos, humor, and argument.\r\n\r\nOne night, crossing the Mississippi at McGregor, Iowa, we were icebound\r\nin the middle of the river. The boat was crowded with people, hungry,\r\ntired, and cross with the delay. Some gentlemen, with whom we had been\r\ntalking on the cars, started the cry, \"Speech on woman suffrage!\"\r\nAccordingly, in the middle of the Mississippi River, at midnight, we\r\npresented our claims to political representation, and debated the\r\nquestion of universal suffrage until we landed. Our voyagers were quite\r\nthankful that we had shortened the many hours, and we equally so at\r\nhaving made several converts and held a convention on the very bosom of\r\nthe great \"Mother of Waters.\" Only once in all these wanderings was Miss\r\nAnthony taken by surprise, and that was on being asked to speak to the\r\ninmates of an insane asylum. \"Bless me!\" said she, \"it is as much as I\r\ncan do to talk to the sane! What could I say to an audience of\r\nlunatics?\" Her companion, Virginia L. Minor of St. Louis, replied: \"This\r\nis a golden moment for you, the first opportunity you have ever had,\r\naccording to the constitutions, to talk to your 'peers,' for is not the\r\nright of suffrage denied to 'idiots, criminals, lunatics, and women'?\"\r\n\r\nMuch curiosity has been expressed as to the love-life of Miss Anthony;\r\nbut, if she has enjoyed or suffered any of the usual triumphs or\r\ndisappointments of her sex, she has not yet vouchsafed this information\r\nto her biographers. While few women have had more sincere and lasting\r\nfriendships, or a more extensive correspondence with a large circle of\r\nnoble men, yet I doubt if one of them can boast of having received from\r\nher any exceptional attention. She has often playfully said, when\r\nquestioned on this point, that she could not consent that the man she\r\nloved, described in the Constitution as a white male, native born,\r\nAmerican citizen, possessed of the right of self-government, eligible to\r\nthe office of President of the great Republic, should unite his\r\ndestinies in marriage with a political slave and pariah. \"No, no; when I\r\nam crowned with all the rights, privileges, and immunities of a citizen,\r\nI may give some consideration to this social institution; but until then\r\nI must concentrate all my energies on the enfranchisement of my own\r\nsex.\" Miss Anthony's love-life, like her religion, has manifested itself\r\nin steadfast, earnest labors for men in general. She has been a watchful\r\nand affectionate daughter, sister, friend, and those who have felt the\r\npulsations of her great heart know how warmly it beats for all.\r\n\r\nAs the custom has long been observed, among married women, of\r\ncelebrating the anniversaries of their wedding-day, quite properly the\r\ninitiative has been taken, in late years, of doing honor to the great\r\nevents in the lives of single women. Being united in closest bonds to\r\nher profession, Dr. Harriet K. Hunt of Boston celebrated her\r\ntwenty-fifth year of faithful services as a physician by giving to her\r\nfriends and patrons a large reception, which she called her silver\r\nwedding. From a feeling of the sacredness of her life work, the admirers\r\nof Susan B. Anthony have been moved to mark, by reception and\r\nconvention, her rapid-flowing years and the passing decades of the\r\nsuffrage movement. To the most brilliant occasion of this kind, the\r\ninvitation cards were as follows:\r\n\r\n     The ladies of the Woman's Bureau invite you to a reception on\r\n     Tuesday evening, February 15th, to celebrate the fiftieth birthday\r\n     of Susan B. Anthony, when her friends will have an opportunity to\r\n     show their appreciation of her long services in behalf of woman's\r\n     emancipation.\r\n\r\n     No. 49 East 23d St., New York,\r\n\r\n     February 10, 1870.\r\n\r\n     Elizabeth B. Phelps,\r\n\r\n     Anna B. Darling,\r\n\r\n     Charlotte Beebe Wilbour.\r\n\r\nIn response to the invitation, the parlors of the bureau were crowded\r\nwith friends to congratulate Miss Anthony on the happy event, many\r\nbringing valuable gifts as an expression of their gratitude. Among other\r\npresents were a handsome gold watch and checks to the amount of a\r\nthousand dollars. The guests were entertained with music, recitations,\r\nthe reading of many piquant letters of regret from distinguished people,\r\nand witty rhymes written for the occasion by the Cary sisters. Miss\r\nAnthony received her guests with her usual straightforward simplicity,\r\nand in a few earnest words expressed her thanks for the presents and\r\npraises showered upon her. The comments of the leading journals, next\r\nday, were highly complimentary, and as genial as amusing. All dwelt on\r\nthe fact that, at last, a woman had arisen brave enough to assert her\r\nright to grow old and openly declare that half a century had rolled over\r\nher head.\r\n\r\nOf carefully prepared written speeches Miss Anthony has made few; but\r\nthese, by the high praise they called forth, prove that she can--in\r\nspite of her own declaration to the contrary--put her sterling thoughts\r\non paper concisely and effectively. After her exhaustive plea, in 1880,\r\nfor a Sixteenth Amendment before the Judiciary Committee of the Senate,\r\nSenator Edmunds accosted her, as she was leaving the Capitol, and said\r\nhe neglected to tell her, in the committee room, that she had made an\r\nargument, no matter what his personal feelings were as to the\r\nconclusions reached, which was unanswerable--an argument, unlike the\r\nusual platform oratory given at hearings, suited to a committee of men\r\ntrained to the law.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1876 that Miss Anthony gave her much criticised lecture on\r\n\"Social Purity\" in Boston. As to the result she felt very anxious; for\r\nthe intelligence of New England composed her audience, and it did not\r\nstill her heart-beats to see, sitting just in front of the platform, her\r\nrevered friend, William Lloyd Garrison. But surely every fear vanished\r\nwhen she felt the grand old abolitionist's hand warmly pressing hers,\r\nand heard him say that to listen to no one else would he have had\r\ncourage to leave his sick room, and that he felt fully repaid by her\r\ngrand speech, which neither in matter nor manner would he have changed\r\nin the smallest particular. But into Miss Anthony's private\r\ncorrespondence one must look for examples of her most effective writing.\r\nVerb or substantive is often wanting, but you can always catch the\r\nthought, and will ever find it clear and suggestive. It is a strikingly\r\nstrange dialect, but one that touches, at times, the deepest chords of\r\npathos and humor, and, when stirred by some great event, is highly\r\neloquent.\r\n\r\nFrom being the most ridiculed and mercilessly persecuted woman, Miss\r\nAnthony has become the most honored and respected in the nation. Witness\r\nthe praises of press and people, and the enthusiastic ovations she\r\nreceived on her departure for Europe in 1883. Never were warmer\r\nexpressions of regret for an absence, nor more sincere prayers for a\r\nspeedy return, accorded to any American on leaving his native shores.\r\nThis slow awaking to the character of her services shows the abiding\r\nsense of justice in the human soul. Having spent the winter of 1882-83\r\nin Washington, trying to press to a vote the bill for a Sixteenth\r\nAmendment before Congress, and the autumn in a vigorous campaign through\r\nNebraska, where a constitutional amendment to enfranchise women had been\r\nsubmitted to the people, she felt the imperative need of an entire\r\nchange in the current of her thoughts. Accordingly, after one of the\r\nmost successful conventions ever held at the national capital, and a\r\nmost flattering ovation in the spacious parlors of the Riggs House, and\r\na large reception in Philadelphia, she sailed for Europe.\r\n\r\nFortunate in being perfectly well during the entire voyage, our traveler\r\nreceived perpetual enjoyment in watching the ever varying sea and sky.\r\nTo the captain's merry challenge to find anything so grand as the ocean,\r\nshe replied, \"Yes, these mighty forces in nature do indeed fill me with\r\nawe; but this vessel, with deep-buried fires, powerful machinery,\r\nspacious decks, and tapering masts, walking the waves like a thing of\r\nlife, and all the work of man, impresses one still more deeply. Lo! in\r\nman's divine creative power is fulfilled the prophecy, 'Ye shall be as\r\nGods!'\"\r\n\r\nIn all her journeyings through Germany, Italy, and France, Miss Anthony\r\nwas never the mere sight-seer, but always the humanitarian and reformer\r\nin traveler's guise. Few of the great masterpieces of art gave her real\r\nenjoyment. The keen appreciation of the beauties of sculpture, painting,\r\nand architecture, which one would have expected to find in so deep a\r\nreligious nature, was wanting, warped, no doubt, by her early Quaker\r\ntraining. That her travels gave her more pain than pleasure was,\r\nperhaps, not so much that she had no appreciation of aesthetic beauty,\r\nbut that she quickly grasped the infinitude of human misery; not because\r\nher soul did not feel the heights to which art had risen, but that it\r\nvibrated in every fiber to the depths to which mankind had fallen.\r\nWandering through a gorgeous palace one day, she exclaimed, \"What do you\r\nfind to admire here? If it were a school of five hundred children being\r\neducated into the right of self-government I could admire it, too; but\r\nstanding for one man's pleasure, I say no!\" In the quarters of one of\r\nthe devotees, at the old monastery of the Certosa, at Florence, there\r\nlies, on a small table, an open book, in which visitors register. On the\r\noccasion of Miss Anthony's visit the pen and ink proved so unpromising\r\nthat her entire party declined this opportunity to make themselves\r\nfamous, but she made the rebellious pen inscribe, \"Perfect equality for\r\nwomen, civil, political, religious. Susan B. Anthony, U.S.A.\" Friends,\r\nwho visited the monastery next day, reported that lines had been drawn\r\nthrough this heretical sentiment.\r\n\r\nDuring her visit at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Sargent, in Berlin, Miss\r\nAnthony quite innocently posted her letters in the official envelopes of\r\nour Suffrage Association, which bore the usual mottoes, \"No just\r\ngovernment can be formed without the consent of the governed,\" etc. In a\r\nfew days an official brought back a large package, saying, \"Such\r\nsentiments are not allowed to pass through the post office.\" Probably\r\nnothing saved her from arrest as a socialist, under the tyrannical\r\npolice regulations, but the fact that she was the guest of the Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary of the United States.\r\n\r\nMy son Theodore wrote of Miss Anthony's visit in Paris: \"I had never\r\nbefore seen her in the role of tourist. She seemed interested only in\r\nhistorical monuments, and in the men and questions of the hour. The\r\ngalleries of the Louvre had little attraction for her, but she gazed\r\nwith deep pleasure at Napoleon's tomb, Notre Dame, and the ruins of the\r\nTuileries. She was always ready to listen to discussions on the\r\npolitical problems before the French people, the prospects of the\r\nRepublic, the divorce agitation, and the education of women. 'I had\r\nrather see Jules Ferry than all the pictures of the Louvre, Luxembourg,\r\nand Salon,' she remarked at table. A day or two later she saw Ferry at\r\nLaboulaye's funeral. The three things which made the deepest impression\r\non Miss Anthony, during her stay at Paris, were probably the interment\r\nof Laboulaye (the friend of the United States and of the woman\r\nmovement); the touching anniversary demonstration of the Communists, at\r\nthe Cemetery of Père La Chaise, on the very spot where the last\r\ndefenders of the Commune of 1871 were ruthlessly shot and buried in a\r\ncommon grave; and a woman's rights meeting, held in a little hall in the\r\nRue de Rivoli, at which the brave, far-seeing Mlle. Hubertine Auchet was\r\nthe leading spirit.\"\r\n\r\nWhile on the Continent Miss Anthony experienced the unfortunate\r\nsensation of being deaf and dumb; to speak and not to be understood, to\r\nhear and not to comprehend, were to her bitter realities. We can imagine\r\nto what desperation she was brought when her Quaker prudishness could\r\nhail an emphatic oath in English from a French official with the\r\nexclamation, \"Well, it sounds good to hear someone even swear in old\r\nAnglo-Saxon!\" After two months of enforced silence, she was buoyant in\r\nreaching the British Islands once more, where she could enjoy public\r\nspeaking and general conversation. Here she was the recipient of many\r\ngenerous social attentions, and, on May 25, a large public meeting of\r\nrepresentative people, presided over by Jacob Bright, was called, in our\r\nhonor, by the National Association of Great Britain. She spoke on the\r\neducational and political status of women in America, I of their\r\nreligious and social position.\r\n\r\nBefore closing my friend's biography I shall trace two golden threads in\r\nthis closely woven life of incident. One of the greatest services\r\nrendered by Miss Anthony to the suffrage cause was in casting a vote in\r\nthe Presidential election of 1872, in order to test the rights of women\r\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. For this offense the brave woman was\r\narrested, on Thanksgiving Day, the national holiday handed down to us by\r\nPilgrim Fathers escaped from England's persecutions. She asked for a\r\nwrit of habeas corpus. The writ being flatly refused, in January, 1873,\r\nher counsel gave bonds. The daring defendant finding, when too late,\r\nthat this not only kept her out of jail, but her case out of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, regretfully determined to fight on, and gain\r\nthe uttermost by a decision in the United States Circuit Court. Her\r\ntrial was set down for the Rochester term in May. Quickly she canvassed\r\nthe whole county, laying before every probable juror the strength of her\r\ncase. When the time for the trial arrived, the District Attorney,\r\nfearing the result, if the decision were left to a jury drawn from Miss\r\nAnthony's enlightened county, transferred the trial to the Ontario\r\nCounty term, in June, 1873.\r\n\r\nIt was now necessary to instruct the citizens of another county. In this\r\ntask Miss Anthony received valuable assistance from Matilda Joslyn Gage;\r\nand, to meet all this new expense, financial aid was generously given,\r\nunsolicited, by Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Gerrit Smith, and other\r\nsympathizers. But in vain was every effort; in vain the appeal of Miss\r\nAnthony to her jurors; in vain the moral influence of the leading\r\nrepresentatives of the bar of Central New York filling the courtroom,\r\nfor Judge Hunt, without precedent to sustain him, declaring it a case of\r\nlaw and not of fact, refused to give the case to the jury, reserving to\r\nhimself final decision. Was it not an historic scene which was enacted\r\nthere in that little courthouse in Canandaigua? All the inconsistencies\r\nwere embodied in that Judge, punctilious in manner, scrupulous in\r\nattire, conscientious in trivialities, and obtuse on great principles,\r\nfitly described by Charles O'Conor--\"A very ladylike Judge.\" Behold him\r\nsitting there, balancing all the niceties of law and equity in his Old\r\nWorld scales, and at last saying, \"The prisoner will stand up.\"\r\nWhereupon the accused arose. \"The sentence of the court is that you pay\r\na fine of one hundred dollars and the costs of the prosecution.\" Then\r\nthe unruly defendant answers: \"May it please your Honor, I shall never\r\npay a dollar of your unjust penalty,\" and more to the same effect, all\r\nof which she has lived up to. The \"ladylike\" Judge had gained some\r\ninsight into the determination of the prisoner; so, not wishing to\r\nincarcerate her to all eternity, he added gently: \"Madam, the court\r\nwill not order you committed until the fine is paid.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on the 17th of June that the verdict was given. On that very day,\r\na little less than a century before, the brave militia was driven back\r\nat Bunker Hill--back, back, almost wiped out; yet truth was in their\r\nranks, and justice, too. But how ended that rebellion of weak colonists?\r\nThe cause of American womanhood, embodied for the moment in the liberty\r\nof a single individual, received a rebuff on June 17, 1873; but, just as\r\nsurely as our Revolutionary heroes were in the end victorious, so will\r\nthe inalienable rights of our heroines of the nineteenth century receive\r\nfinal vindication.\r\n\r\nIn his speech of 1880, before the Phi Beta Kappa Society at Harvard,\r\nWendell Phillips said--what as a rule is true--that \"a reformer, to be\r\nconscientious, must be free from bread-winning.\" I will open Miss\r\nAnthony's accounts and show that this reformer, being, perhaps, the\r\nexception which proves the rule, has been consistently and\r\nconscientiously in debt. Turning over her year-books the pages give a\r\nfair record up to 1863. Here began the first herculean labor. The\r\nWoman's Loyal League, sadly in need of funds, was not an incorporated\r\nassociation, so its secretary assumed the debts. Accounts here became\r\nquite lamentable, the deficit reaching five thousand dollars. It must be\r\npaid, and, in fact, will be paid. Anxious, weary hours were spent in\r\ncrowding the Cooper Institute, from week to week, with paying audiences,\r\nto listen to such men as Phillips, Curtis, and Douglass, who contributed\r\ntheir services, and lifted the secretary out of debt. At last, after\r\nmany difficulties, her cash-book of 1863 was honorably pigeon-holed. In\r\n1867 we can read account of herculean labor the second. Twenty thousand\r\ntracts are needed to convert the voters of Kansas to woman suffrage.\r\nTraveling expenses to Kansas, and the tracts, make the debtor column\r\noverreach the creditor some two thousand dollars. There is recognition\r\non these pages of more than one thousand dollars obtained by soliciting\r\nadvertisements, but no note is made of the weary, burning July days\r\nspent in the streets of New York to procure this money, nor of the ready\r\napplication of the savings made by petty economies from her salary from\r\nthe Hovey Committee.\r\n\r\nIt would have been fortunate for my brave friend, if cash-books 1868,\r\n1869, and 1870 had never come down from their shelves; for they sing and\r\nsing, in notes of debts, till all unite in one vast chorus of far more\r\nthan ten thousand dollars. These were the days of the _Revolution_, the\r\nnewspaper, not the war, though it was warfare for the debt-ridden\r\nmanager. Several thousand dollars she paid with money earned by\r\nlecturing, and with money given her for personal use. One Thanksgiving\r\nwas, in truth, a time for returning thanks; for she received, canceled,\r\nfrom her cousin, Anson Lapham, her note for four thousand dollars. After\r\nthe funeral of Paulina Wright Davis, the bereaved widower pressed into\r\nMiss Anthony's hand canceled notes for five hundred dollars, bearing on\r\nthe back the words, \"In memory of my beloved wife.\" One other note was\r\ncanceled in recognition of her perfect forgetfulness of self-interest\r\nand ready sacrifice to the needs of others. When laboring, in 1874, to\r\nfill every engagement, in order to meet her debts, her mother's sudden\r\nillness called her home. Without one selfish regret, the anxious\r\ndaughter hastened to Rochester. When recovery was certain, and Miss\r\nAnthony was about to return to her fatiguing labors, her mother gave\r\nher, at parting, her note for a thousand dollars, on which was written,\r\nin trembling lines, \"In just consideration of the tender sacrifice made\r\nto nurse me in severe illness.\" At last all the _Revolution_ debt was\r\npaid, except that due to her generous sister, Mary Anthony, who used\r\noften humorously to assure her she was a fit subject for the bankrupt\r\nact.\r\n\r\nThere is something humorously pathetic in the death of the\r\n_Revolution_--that firstborn of Miss Anthony. Mrs. Laura Curtis Bullard\r\ngenerously assumed the care of the troublesome child, and, in order to\r\nmake the adoption legal, gave the usual consideration--one dollar. The\r\nvery night of the transfer Miss Anthony went to Rochester with the\r\ndollar in her pocket, and the little change left after purchasing her\r\nticket. She arrived safely with her debts, but nothing more--her pocket\r\nhad been picked! Oh, thief, could you but know what value of faithful\r\nwork you purloined!\r\n\r\nFrom the close of the year 1876 Miss Anthony's accounts showed favorable\r\nsigns as to the credit column. Indeed, at the end of five years there\r\nwas a solid balance of several thousand dollars earned on lecturing\r\ntours. But alas! the accounts grow dim again--in fact the credit column\r\nfades away. \"The History of Woman Suffrage\" ruthlessly swallowed up\r\nevery vestige of Miss Anthony's bank account. But, in 1886, by the will\r\nof Mrs. Eddy, daughter of Francis Jackson of Boston, Miss Anthony\r\nreceived twenty-four thousand dollars for the Woman's Suffrage Movement,\r\nwhich lifted her out of debt once more.\r\n\r\nIn vain will you search these telltale books for evidence of personal\r\nextravagance; for, although Miss Anthony thinks it true economy to buy\r\nthe best, her tastes are simple. Is there not something very touching in\r\nthe fact that she never bought a book or picture for her own enjoyment?\r\nThe meager personal balance-sheets show four lapses from\r\ndiscipline,--lapses that she even now regards as ruthless\r\nextravagance,--viz.: the purchase of two inexpensive brooches, a much\r\nneeded watch, and a pair of cuffs to match a point-lace collar presented\r\nby a friend. Those interested in Miss Anthony's personal appearance long\r\nago ceased to trust her with the purchase-money for any ornament; for,\r\nhowever firm her resolution to comply with their wish, the check\r\ninvariably found its way to the credit column of those little cash-books\r\nas \"money received for the cause.\" Now, reader, you have been admitted\r\nto a private view of Miss Anthony's financial records, and you can\r\nappreciate her devotion to an idea. Do you not agree with me that a\r\n\"bread-winner\" can be a conscientious reformer?\r\n\r\nIn finishing this sketch of the most intimate friend I have had for the\r\npast forty-five years,--with whom I have spent weeks and months under\r\nthe same roof,--I can truly say that she is the most upright,\r\ncourageous, self-sacrificing, magnanimous human being I have ever known.\r\nI have seen her beset on every side with the most petty annoyances,\r\nridiculed and misrepresented, slandered and persecuted; I have known\r\nwomen refuse to take her extended hand; women to whom she presented\r\ncopies of \"The History of Woman Suffrage,\" return it unnoticed; others\r\nto keep it without one word of acknowledgment; others to write most\r\ninsulting letters in answer to hers of affectionate conciliation. And\r\nyet, under all the cross-fires incident to a reform, never has her hope\r\nflagged, her self-respect wavered, or a feeling of resentment shadowed\r\nher mind. Oftentimes, when I have been sorely discouraged, thinking that\r\nthe prolonged struggle was a waste of force which in other directions\r\nmight be rich in achievement, with her sublime faith in humanity, she\r\nwould breathe into my soul renewed inspiration, saying, \"Pity rather\r\nthan blame those who persecute us.\" So closely interwoven have been our\r\nlives, our purposes, and experiences that, separated, we have a feeling\r\nof incompleteness--united, such strength of self-assertion that no\r\nordinary obstacles, difficulties, or dangers ever appear to us\r\ninsurmountable. Reviewing the life of Susan B. Anthony, I ever liken her\r\nto the Doric column in Grecian architecture, so simply, so grandly she\r\nstands, free from every extraneous ornament, supporting her one vast\r\nidea--the enfranchisement of woman.\r\n\r\nAs our estimate of ourselves and our friendship may differ somewhat from\r\nthat taken from an objective point of view, I will give an extract from\r\nwhat our common friend Theodore Tilton wrote of us in 1868:\r\n\r\n     \"Miss Susan B. Anthony, a well-known, indefatigable, and lifelong\r\n     advocate of temperance, anti-slavery, and woman's rights, has been,\r\n     since 1851, Mrs. Stanton's intimate associate in reformatory\r\n     labors. These celebrated women are of about equal age, but of the\r\n     most opposite characteristics, and illustrate the theory of\r\n     counterparts in affection by entertaining for each other a\r\n     friendship of extraordinary strength.\r\n\r\n     \"Mrs. Stanton is a fine writer, but a poor executant; Miss Anthony\r\n     is a thorough manager, but a poor writer. Both have large brains\r\n     and great hearts; neither has any selfish ambition for celebrity;\r\n     but each vies with the other in a noble enthusiasm for the cause to\r\n     which they are devoting their lives.\r\n\r\n     \"Nevertheless, to describe them critically, I ought to say that,\r\n     opposites though they be, each does not so much supplement the\r\n     other's deficiencies as augment the other's eccentricities. Thus\r\n     they often stimulate each other's aggressiveness, and, at the same\r\n     time, diminish each other's discretion.\r\n\r\n     \"But, whatever may be the imprudent utterances of the one or the\r\n     impolitic methods of the other, the animating motives of both are\r\n     evermore as white as the light. The good that they do is by design;\r\n     the harm by accident. These two women, sitting together in their\r\n     parlors, have, for the last thirty years, been diligent forgers of\r\n     all manner of projectiles, from fireworks to thunderbolts, and have\r\n     hurled them with unexpected explosion into the midst of all manner\r\n     of educational, reformatory, religious, and political assemblies;\r\n     sometimes to the pleasant surprise and half welcome of the members,\r\n     more often to the bewilderment and prostration of numerous victims;\r\n     and, in a few signal instances, to the gnashing of angry men's\r\n     teeth. I know of no two more pertinacious incendiaries in the whole\r\n     country. Nor will they, themselves deny the charge. In fact this\r\n     noise-making twain are the two sticks of a drum, keeping up what\r\n     Daniel Webster called 'The rub-a-dub of agitation.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMY FIRST SPEECH BEFORE A LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen had been willing so long to hold a subordinate position, both in\r\nprivate and public affairs, that a gradually growing feeling of\r\nrebellion among them quite exasperated the men, and their manifestations\r\nof hostility in public meetings were often as ridiculous as humiliating.\r\n\r\nTrue, those gentlemen were all quite willing that women should join\r\ntheir societies and churches to do the drudgery; to work up the\r\nenthusiasm in fairs and revivals, conventions and flag presentations; to\r\npay a dollar apiece into their treasury for the honor of being members\r\nof their various organizations; to beg money for the Church; to\r\ncirculate petitions from door to door; to visit saloons; to pray with or\r\ndefy rumsellers; to teach school at half price, and sit round the\r\noutskirts of a hall, in teachers' State conventions, like so many\r\nwallflowers; but they would not allow them to sit on the platform,\r\naddress the assembly, or vote for men and measures.\r\n\r\nThose who had learned the first lessons of human rights from the lips of\r\nHenry B. Stanton, Samuel J. May, and Gerrit Smith would not accept any\r\nsuch position. When women abandoned the temperance reform, all interest\r\nin the question gradually died out in the State, and practically nothing\r\nwas done in New York for nearly twenty years. Gerrit Smith made one or\r\ntwo attempts toward an \"anti-dramshop\" party, but, as women could not\r\nvote, they felt no interest in the measure, and failure was the result.\r\n\r\nI soon convinced Miss Anthony that the ballot was the key to the\r\nsituation; that when we had a voice in the laws we should be welcome to\r\nany platform. In turning the intense earnestness and religious\r\nenthusiasm of this great-souled woman into this channel, I soon felt the\r\npower of my convert in goading me forever forward to more untiring work.\r\nSoon fastened, heart to heart, with hooks of steel in a friendship that\r\nyears of confidence and affection have steadily strengthened, we have\r\nlabored faithfully together.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1850 conventions were held in various States, and their\r\nrespective legislatures were continually besieged; New York was\r\nthoroughly canvassed by Miss Anthony and others. Appeals, calls for\r\nmeetings, and petitions were circulated without number. In 1854 I\r\nprepared my first speech for the New York legislature. That was a great\r\nevent in my life. I felt so nervous over it, lest it should not be\r\nworthy the occasion, that Miss Anthony suggested that I should slip up\r\nto Rochester and submit it to the Rev. William Henry Channing, who was\r\npreaching there at that time. I did so, and his opinion was so favorable\r\nas to the merits of my speech that I felt quite reassured. My father\r\nfelt equally nervous when he saw, by the Albany _Evening Journal_, that\r\nI was to speak at the Capitol, and asked me to read my speech to him\r\nalso. Accordingly, I stopped at Johnstown on my way to Albany, and, late\r\none evening, when he was alone in his office, I entered and took my seat\r\non the opposite side of his table. On no occasion, before or since, was\r\nI ever more embarrassed--an audience of one, and that the one of all\r\nothers whose approbation I most desired, whose disapproval I most\r\nfeared. I knew he condemned the whole movement, and was deeply grieved\r\nat the active part I had taken. Hence I was fully aware that I was about\r\nto address a wholly unsympathetic audience. However, I began, with a\r\ndogged determination to give all the power I could to my manuscript, and\r\nnot to be discouraged or turned from my purpose by any tender appeals or\r\nadverse criticisms. I described the widow in the first hours of her\r\ngrief, subject to the intrusions of the coarse minions of the law,\r\ntaking inventory of the household goods, of the old armchair in which\r\nher loved one had breathed his last, of the old clock in the corner that\r\ntold the hour he passed away. I threw all the pathos I could into my\r\nvoice and language at this point, and, to my intense satisfaction, I saw\r\ntears filling my father's eyes. I cannot express the exultation I felt,\r\nthinking that now he would see, with my eyes, the injustice women\r\nsuffered under the laws he understood so well.\r\n\r\nFeeling that I had touched his heart I went on with renewed confidence,\r\nand, when I had finished, I saw he was thoroughly magnetized. With\r\nbeating heart I waited for him to break the silence. He was evidently\r\ndeeply pondering over all he had heard, and did not speak for a long\r\ntime. I believed I had opened to him a new world of thought. He had\r\nlistened long to the complaints of women, but from the lips of his own\r\ndaughter they had come with a deeper pathos and power. At last, turning\r\nabruptly, he said: \"Surely you have had a happy, comfortable life, with\r\nall your wants and needs supplied; and yet that speech fills me with\r\nself-reproach; for one might naturally ask, how can a young woman,\r\ntenderly brought up, who has had no bitter personal experience, feel so\r\nkeenly the wrongs of her sex? Where did you learn this lesson?\" \"I\r\nlearned it here,\" I replied, \"in your office, when a child, listening to\r\nthe complaints women made to you. They who have sympathy and imagination\r\nto make the sorrows of others their own can readily learn all the hard\r\nlessons of life from the experience of others.\" \"Well, well!\" he said,\r\n\"you have made your points clear and strong; but I think I can find you\r\neven more cruel laws than those you have quoted.\" He suggested some\r\nimprovements in my speech, looked up other laws, and it was one o'clock\r\nin the morning before we kissed each other good-night. How he felt on\r\nthe question after that I do not know, as he never said anything in\r\nfavor of or against it. He gladly gave me any help I needed, from time\r\nto time, in looking up the laws, and was very desirous that whatever I\r\ngave to the public should be carefully prepared.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony printed twenty thousand copies of this address, laid it on\r\nthe desk of every member of the legislature, both in the Assembly and\r\nSenate, and, in her travels that winter, she circulated it throughout\r\nthe State. I am happy to say I never felt so anxious about the fate of a\r\nspeech since.\r\n\r\nThe first woman's convention in Albany was held at this time, and we had\r\na kind of protracted meeting for two weeks after. There were several\r\nhearings before both branches of the legislature, and a succession of\r\nmeetings in Association Hall, in which Phillips, Channing, Ernestine L.\r\nRose, Antoinette L. Brown, and Susan B. Anthony took part. Being at the\r\ncapital of the State, discussion was aroused at every fireside, while\r\nthe comments of the press were numerous and varied. Every little country\r\npaper had something witty or silly to say about the uprising of the\r\n\"strong-minded.\" Those editors whose heads were about the size of an\r\napple were the most opposed to the uprising of women, illustrating what\r\nSidney Smith said long ago: \"There always was, and there always will be\r\na class of men so small that, if women were educated, there would be\r\nnobody left below them.\" Poor human nature loves to have something to\r\nlook down upon!\r\n\r\nHere is a specimen of the way such editors talked at that time. The\r\n_Albany Register_, in an article on \"Woman's Rights in the Legislature,\"\r\ndated March 7, 1854, says:\r\n\r\n     \"While the feminine propagandists of women's rights confined\r\n     themselves to the exhibition of short petticoats and long-legged\r\n     boots, and to the holding of conventions and speech-making in\r\n     concert rooms, the people were disposed to be amused by them, as\r\n     they are by the wit of the clown in the circus, or the performances\r\n     of Punch and Judy on fair days, or the minstrelsy of gentlemen with\r\n     blackened faces, on banjos, the tambourine, and bones. But the joke\r\n     is becoming stale. People are getting cloyed with these\r\n     performances, and are looking for some healthier and more\r\n     intellectual amusement. The ludicrous is wearing away, and disgust\r\n     is taking the place of pleasurable sensations, arising from the\r\n     novelty of this new phase of hypocrisy and infidel fanaticism.\r\n\r\n     \"People are beginning to inquire how far public sentiment should\r\n     sanction or tolerate these unsexed women, who would step out from\r\n     the true sphere of the mother, the wife, and the daughter, and\r\n     taking upon themselves the duties and the business of men, stalk\r\n     into the public gaze, and, by engaging in the politics, the rough\r\n     controversies and trafficking of the world, upheave existing\r\n     institutions, and overrun all the social relations of life.\r\n\r\n     \"It is a melancholy reflection that, among our American women, who\r\n     have been educated to better things, there should be found any who\r\n     are willing to follow the lead of such foreign propagandists as the\r\n     ringleted, gloved exotic, Ernestine L. Rose. We can understand how\r\n     such a man as the Rev. Mr. May, or the sleek-headed Dr. Channing,\r\n     may be deluded by her into becoming one of her disciples. They are\r\n     not the first instances of infatuation that may overtake\r\n     weak-minded men, if they are honest in their devotion to her and\r\n     her doctrines; nor would they be the first examples of a low\r\n     ambition that seeks notoriety as a substitute for true fame, if\r\n     they are dishonest. Such men there are always, and, honest or\r\n     dishonest, their true position is that of being tied to the apron\r\n     strings of some strong-minded woman, and to be exhibited as rare\r\n     specimens of human wickedness or human weakness and folly. But that\r\n     one educated American should become her disciple and follow her\r\n     insane teachings is a marvel.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we see the abuse and ridicule to which the best of men were\r\nsubjected for standing on our platform in the early days, we need not\r\nwonder that so few have been brave enough to advocate our cause in later\r\nyears, either in conventions or in the halls of legislation.\r\n\r\nAfter twelve added years of agitation, following the passage of the\r\nProperty Bill, New York conceded other civil rights to married women.\r\nPending the discussion of these various bills, Susan B. Anthony\r\ncirculated petitions, both for the civil and political rights of women,\r\nthroughout the State, traveling in stage coaches, open wagons, and\r\nsleighs in all seasons, and on foot, from door to door through towns and\r\ncities, doing her uttermost to rouse women to some sense of their\r\nnatural rights as human beings, and to their civil and political rights\r\nas citizens of a republic. And while expending her time, strength, and\r\nmoney to secure these blessings for the women of the State, they would\r\ngruffly tell her that they had all the rights they wanted, or rudely\r\nshut the door in her face; leaving her to stand outside, petition in\r\nhand, treating her with as much contempt as if she was asking alms for\r\nherself. None but those who did that work in the early days, for the\r\nslaves and the women, can ever know the hardships and humiliations that\r\nwere endured. But it was done because it was only through petitions--a\r\npower seemingly so inefficient--that disfranchised classes could be\r\nheard in the State and National councils; hence their importance.\r\n\r\nThe frivolous objections some women made to our appeals were as\r\nexasperating as they were ridiculous. To reply to them politely, at all\r\ntimes, required a divine patience. On one occasion, after addressing the\r\nlegislature, some of the ladies, in congratulating me, inquired, in a\r\ndeprecating tone, \"What do you do with your children?\" \"Ladies,\" I said,\r\n\"it takes me no longer to speak, than you to listen; what have you done\r\nwith your children the two hours you have been sitting here? But, to\r\nanswer your question, I never leave my children to go to Saratoga,\r\nWashington, Newport, or Europe, or even to come here. They are, at this\r\nmoment, with a faithful nurse at the Delevan House, and, having\r\naccomplished my mission, we shall all return home together.\"\r\n\r\nWhen my children reached the magic number of seven, my good angel, Susan\r\nB. Anthony, would sometimes take one or two of them to her own quiet\r\nhome, just out of Rochester, where, on a well-cultivated little farm,\r\none could enjoy uninterrupted rest and the choicest fruits of the\r\nseason. That was always a safe harbor for my friend, as her family\r\nsympathized fully in the reforms to which she gave her life. I have many\r\npleasant memories of my own flying visits to that hospitable Quaker home\r\nand the broad catholic spirit of Daniel and Lucy Anthony. Whatever\r\nopposition and ridicule their daughter endured elsewhere, she enjoyed\r\nthe steadfast sympathy and confidence of her own home circle. Her\r\nfaithful sister Mary, a most successful teacher in the public schools of\r\nRochester for a quarter of a century, and a good financier, who with her\r\npatrimony and salary had laid by a competence, took on her shoulders\r\ndouble duty at home in cheering the declining years of her parents, that\r\nSusan might do the public work in the reforms in which they were equally\r\ninterested. Now, with life's earnest work nearly accomplished, the\r\nsisters are living happily together; illustrating another of the many\r\ncharming homes of single women, so rapidly multiplying of late.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony, who was a frequent guest at my home, sometimes stood guard\r\nwhen I was absent. The children of our household say that among their\r\nearliest recollections is the tableau of \"Mother and Susan,\" seated by a\r\nlarge table covered with books and papers, always writing and talking\r\nabout the Constitution, interrupted with occasional visits from others\r\nof the faithful. Hither came Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Paulina Wright\r\nDavis, Frances Dana Gage, Dr. Harriet Hunt, Rev. Antoinette Brown, Lucy\r\nStone, and Abby Kelly, until all these names were as familiar as\r\nhousehold words to the children.\r\n\r\nMartha C. Wright of Auburn was a frequent visitor at the center of the\r\nrebellion, as my sequestered cottage on Locust Hill was facetiously\r\ncalled. She brought to these councils of war not only her own wisdom,\r\nbut that of the wife and sister of William H. Seward, and sometimes\r\nencouraging suggestions from the great statesman himself, from whose\r\nwritings we often gleaned grand and radical sentiments. Lucretia Mott,\r\ntoo, being an occasional guest of her sister, Martha C. Wright, added\r\nthe dignity of her presence at many of these important consultations.\r\nShe was uniformly in favor of toning down our fiery pronunciamentos. For\r\nMiss Anthony and myself, the English language had no words strong enough\r\nto express the indignation we felt at the prolonged injustice to women.\r\nWe found, however, that, after expressing ourselves in the most vehement\r\nmanner and thus in a measure giving our feelings an outlet, we were\r\nreconciled to issue the documents in milder terms. If the men of the\r\nState could have known the stern rebukes, the denunciations, the wit,\r\nthe irony, the sarcasm that were garnered there, and then judiciously\r\npigeonholed and milder and more persuasive appeals substituted, they\r\nwould have been truly thankful that they fared no worse.\r\n\r\nSenator Seward frequently left Washington to visit in our neighborhood,\r\nat the house of Judge G.V. Sackett, a man of wealth and political\r\ninfluence. One of the Senator's standing anecdotes, at dinner, to\r\nillustrate the purifying influence of women at the polls, which he\r\nalways told with great zest for my especial benefit, was in regard to\r\nthe manner in which his wife's sister exercised the right of suffrage.\r\n\r\nHe said: \"Mrs. Worden having the supervision of a farm near Auburn, was\r\nobliged to hire two or three men for its cultivation. It was her custom,\r\nhaving examined them as to their capacity to perform the required labor,\r\ntheir knowledge of tools, horses, cattle, and horticulture, to inquire\r\nas to their politics. She informed them that, being a widow and having\r\nno one to represent her, she must have Republicans to do her voting and\r\nto represent her political opinions, and it always so happened that the\r\nmen who offered their services belonged to the Republican party. I\r\nremarked to her, one day, 'Are you sure your men vote as they promise?'\r\n'Yes,' she replied, 'I trust nothing to their discretion. I take them in\r\nmy carriage within sight of the polls and put them in charge of some\r\nRepublican who can be trusted. I see that they have the right tickets\r\nand then I feel sure that I am faithfully represented, and I know I am\r\nright in so doing. I have neither husband, father, nor son; I am\r\nresponsible for my own taxes; am amenable to all the laws of the State;\r\nmust pay the penalty of my own crimes if I commit any; hence I have the\r\nright, according to the principles of our government, to representation,\r\nand so long as I am not permitted to vote in person, I have a right to\r\ndo so by proxy; hence I hire men to vote my principles.'\"\r\n\r\nThese two sisters, Mrs. Worden and Mrs. Seward, daughters of Judge\r\nMiller, an influential man, were women of culture and remarkable natural\r\nintelligence, and interested in all progressive ideas. They had rare\r\ncommon sense and independence of character, great simplicity of manner,\r\nand were wholly indifferent to the little arts of the toilet.\r\n\r\nI was often told by fashionable women that they objected to the woman's\r\nrights movement because of the publicity of a convention, the immodesty\r\nof speaking from a platform, and the trial of seeing one's name in the\r\npapers. Several ladies made such remarks to me one day, as a bevy of us\r\nwere sitting together in one of the fashionable hotels in Newport. We\r\nwere holding a convention there at that time, and some of them had been\r\npresent at one of the sessions. \"Really,\" said I, \"ladies, you surprise\r\nme; our conventions are not as public as the ballroom where I saw you\r\nall dancing last night. As to modesty, it may be a question, in many\r\nminds, whether it is less modest to speak words of soberness and truth,\r\nplainly dressed on a platform, than gorgeously arrayed, with bare arms\r\nand shoulders, to waltz in the arms of strange gentlemen. And as to the\r\npress, I noticed you all reading, in this morning's papers, with evident\r\nsatisfaction, the personal compliments and full descriptions of your\r\ndresses at the last ball. I presume that any one of you would have felt\r\nslighted if your name had not been mentioned in the general description.\r\nWhen my name is mentioned, it is in connection with some great reform\r\nmovement. Thus we all suffer or enjoy the same publicity--we are alike\r\nridiculed. Wise men pity and ridicule you, and fools pity and ridicule\r\nme--you as the victims of folly and fashion, me as the representative of\r\nmany of the disagreeable 'isms' of the age, as they choose to style\r\nliberal opinions. It is amusing, in analyzing prejudices, to see on what\r\nslender foundation they rest.\" And the ladies around me were so\r\ncompletely cornered that no one attempted an answer.\r\n\r\nI remember being at a party at Secretary Seward's home, at Auburn, one\r\nevening, when Mr. Burlingame, special ambassador from China to the\r\nUnited States, with a Chinese delegation, were among the guests. As soon\r\nas the dancing commenced, and young ladies and gentlemen, locked in each\r\nother's arms, began to whirl in the giddy waltz, these Chinese gentlemen\r\nwere so shocked that they covered their faces with their fans,\r\noccasionally peeping out each side and expressing their surprise to each\r\nother. They thought us the most immodest women on the face of the earth.\r\nModesty and taste are questions of latitude and education; the more\r\npeople know,--the more their ideas are expanded by travel, experience,\r\nand observation,--the less easily they are shocked. The narrowness and\r\nbigotry of women are the result of their circumscribed sphere of thought\r\nand action.\r\n\r\nA few years after Judge Hurlbert had published his work on \"Human\r\nRights,\" in which he advocated woman's right to the suffrage, and I had\r\naddressed the legislature, we met at a dinner party in Albany. Senator\r\nand Mrs. Seward were there. The Senator was very merry on that occasion\r\nand made Judge Hurlbert and myself the target for all his ridicule on\r\nthe woman's rights question, in which the most of the company joined, so\r\nthat we stood quite alone. Sure that we had the right on our side and\r\nthe arguments clearly defined in our minds, and both being cool and\r\nself-possessed, and in wit and sarcasm quite equal to any of them, we\r\nfought the Senator, inch by inch, until he had a very narrow platform to\r\nstand on. Mrs. Seward maintained an unbroken silence, while those ladies\r\nwho did open their lips were with the opposition, supposing, no doubt,\r\nthat Senator Seward represented his wife's opinions.\r\n\r\nWhen we ladies withdrew from the table my embarrassment may be easily\r\nimagined. Separated from the Judge, I would now be an hour with a bevy\r\nof ladies who evidently felt repugnance to all my most cherished\r\nopinions. It was the first time I had met Mrs. Seward, and I did not\r\nthen know the broad, liberal tendencies of her mind. What a tide of\r\ndisagreeable thoughts rushed through me in that short passage from the\r\ndining room to the parlor. How gladly I would have glided out the front\r\ndoor! But that was impossible, so I made up my mind to stroll round as\r\nif self-absorbed, and look at the books and paintings until the Judge\r\nappeared; as I took it for granted that, after all I had said at the\r\ntable on the political, religious, and social equality of women, not a\r\nlady would have anything to say to me.\r\n\r\nImagine, then, my surprise when, the moment the parlor door was closed\r\nupon us, Mrs. Seward, approaching me most affectionately, said:\r\n\r\n\"Let me thank you for the brave words you uttered at the dinner table,\r\nand for your speech before the legislature, that thrilled my soul as I\r\nread it over and over.\"\r\n\r\nI was filled with joy and astonishment. Recovering myself, I said, \"Is\r\nit possible, Mrs. Seward, that you agree with me? Then why, when I was\r\nso hard pressed by foes on every side, did you not come to the defense?\r\nI supposed that all you ladies were hostile to every one of my ideas on\r\nthis question.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" said she; \"I am with you thoroughly, but I am a born coward;\r\nthere is nothing I dread more than Mr. Seward's ridicule. I would rather\r\nwalk up to the cannon's mouth than encounter it.\" \"I, too, am with you,\"\r\n\"And I,\" said two or three others, who had been silent at the table.\r\n\r\nI never had a more serious, heartfelt conversation than with these\r\nladies. Mrs. Seward's spontaneity and earnestness had moved them all\r\ndeeply, and when the Senator appeared the first words he said were:\r\n\r\n\"Before we part I must confess that I was fairly vanquished by you and\r\nthe Judge, on my own principles\" (for we had quoted some of his most\r\nradical utterances). \"You have the argument, but custom and prejudice\r\nare against you, and they are stronger than truth and logic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nREFORMS AND MOBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was one bright woman among the many in our Seneca Falls literary\r\ncircle to whom I would give more than a passing notice--Mrs. Amelia\r\nBloomer, who represented three novel phases of woman's life. She was\r\nassistant postmistress; an editor of a reform paper advocating\r\ntemperance and woman's rights; and an advocate of the new costume which\r\nbore her name!\r\n\r\nIn 1849 her husband was appointed postmaster, and she became his deputy,\r\nwas duly sworn in, and, during the administration of Taylor and\r\nFillmore, served in that capacity. When she assumed her duties the\r\nimprovement in the appearance and conduct of the office was generally\r\nacknowledged. A neat little room adjoining the public office became a\r\nkind of ladies' exchange, where those coming from different parts of the\r\ntown could meet to talk over the news of the day and read the papers and\r\nmagazines that came to Mrs. Bloomer as editor of the _Lily_. Those who\r\nenjoyed the brief reign of a woman in the post office can readily\r\ntestify to the void felt by the ladies of the village when Mrs.\r\nBloomer's term expired and a man once more reigned in her stead.\r\nHowever, she still edited the _Lily_, and her office remained a\r\nfashionable center for several years. Although she wore the bloomer\r\ndress, its originator was Elizabeth Smith Miller, the only daughter of\r\nGerrit Smith. In the winter of 1852 Mrs. Miller came to visit me in\r\nSeneca Falls, dressed somewhat in the Turkish style--short skirt, full\r\ntrousers of fine black broadcloth; a Spanish cloak, of the same\r\nmaterial, reaching to the knee; beaver hat and feathers and dark furs;\r\naltogether a most becoming costume and exceedingly convenient for\r\nwalking in all kinds of weather. To see my cousin, with a lamp in one\r\nhand and a baby in the other, walk upstairs with ease and grace, while,\r\nwith flowing robes, I pulled myself up with difficulty, lamp and baby\r\nout of the question, readily convinced me that there was sore need of\r\nreform in woman's dress, and I promptly donned a similar attire. What\r\nincredible freedom I enjoyed for two years! Like a captive set free from\r\nhis ball and chain, I was always ready for a brisk walk through sleet\r\nand snow and rain, to climb a mountain, jump over a fence, work in the\r\ngarden, and, in fact, for any necessary locomotion.\r\n\r\nBloomer is now a recognized word in the English language. Mrs. Bloomer,\r\nhaving the _Lily_ in which to discuss the merits of the new dress, the\r\npress generally took up the question, and much valuable information was\r\nelicited on the physiological results of woman's fashionable attire; the\r\ncrippling effect of tight waists and long skirts, the heavy weight on\r\nthe hips, and high heels, all combined to throw the spine out of plumb\r\nand lay the foundation for all manner of nervous diseases. But, while\r\nall agreed that some change was absolutely necessary for the health of\r\nwomen, the press stoutly ridiculed those who were ready to make the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nA few sensible women, in different parts of the country, adopted the\r\ncostume, and farmers' wives especially proved its convenience. It was\r\nalso worn by skaters, gymnasts, tourists, and in sanitariums. But, while\r\nthe few realized its advantages, the many laughed it to scorn, and\r\nheaped such ridicule on its wearers that they soon found that the\r\nphysical freedom enjoyed did not compensate for the persistent\r\npersecution and petty annoyances suffered at every turn. To be rudely\r\ngazed at in public and private, to be the conscious subjects of\r\ncriticism, and to be followed by crowds of boys in the streets, were\r\nall, to the very last degree, exasperating. A favorite doggerel that our\r\ntormentors chanted, when we appeared in public places, ran thus:\r\n\r\n    \"Heigh! ho! in rain and snow,\r\n    The bloomer now is all the go.\r\n    Twenty tailors take the stitches,\r\n    Twenty women wear the breeches.\r\n    Heigh! ho! in rain or snow,\r\n    The bloomer now is all the go.\"\r\n\r\nThe singers were generally invisible behind some fence or attic window.\r\nThose who wore the dress can recall countless amusing and annoying\r\nexperiences. The patience of most of us was exhausted in about two\r\nyears; but our leader, Mrs. Miller, bravely adhered to the costume for\r\nnearly seven years, under the most trying circumstances. While her\r\nfather was in Congress, she wore it at many fashionable dinners and\r\nreceptions in Washington. She was bravely sustained, however, by her\r\nhusband, Colonel Miller, who never flinched in escorting his wife and\r\nher coadjutors, however inartistic their costumes might be. To tall,\r\ngaunt women with large feet and to those who were short and stout, it\r\nwas equally trying. Mrs. Miller was also encouraged by the intense\r\nfeeling of her father on the question of woman's dress. To him the whole\r\nrevolution in woman's position turned on her dress. The long skirt was\r\nthe symbol of her degradation.\r\n\r\nThe names of those who wore the bloomer costume, besides those already\r\nmentioned, were Paulina Wright Davis, Lucy Stone, Susan B. Anthony,\r\nSarah and Angelina Grimke, Mrs. William Burleigh, Celia Burleigh,\r\nCharlotte Beebe Wilbour, Helen Jarvis, Lydia Jenkins, Amelia Willard,\r\nDr. Harriet N. Austin, and many patients in sanitariums, whose names I\r\ncannot recall. Looking back to this experiment, I am not surprised at\r\nthe hostility of men in general to the dress, as it made it very\r\nuncomfortable for them to go anywhere with those who wore it. People\r\nwould stare, many men and women make rude remarks, boys followed in\r\ncrowds, with jeers and laughter, so that gentlemen in attendance would\r\nfeel it their duty to show fight, unless they had sufficient\r\nself-control to pursue the even tenor of their way, as the ladies\r\nthemselves did, without taking the slightest notice of the commotion\r\nthey created. But Colonel Miller went through the ordeal with coolness\r\nand dogged determination, to the vexation of his acquaintances, who\r\nthought one of his duties as a husband was to prescribe his wife's\r\ncostume.\r\n\r\nThough we did not realize the success we hoped for by making the dress\r\npopular, yet the effort was not lost. We were well aware that the dress\r\nwas not artistic, and though we made many changes, our own good taste\r\nwas never satisfied until we threw aside the loose trousers and adopted\r\nbuttoned leggins. After giving up the experiment, we found that the\r\ncostume in which Diana the Huntress is represented, and that worn on the\r\nstage by Ellen Tree in the play of \"Ion,\" would have been more artistic\r\nand convenient. But we, who had made the experiment, were too happy to\r\nmove about unnoticed and unknown, to risk, again, the happiness of\r\nourselves and our friends by any further experiments. I have never\r\nwondered since that the Chinese women allow their daughters' feet to be\r\nencased in iron shoes, nor that the Hindoo widows walk calmly to the\r\nfuneral pyre; for great are the penalties of those who dare resist the\r\nbehests of the tyrant Custom.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the agitation has been kept up, in a mild form, both in\r\nEngland and America. Lady Harberton, in 1885, was at the head of an\r\norganized movement in London to introduce the bifurcated skirt; Mrs.\r\nJenness Miller, in this country, is making an entire revolution in every\r\ngarment that belongs to a woman's toilet; and common-sense shoemakers\r\nhave vouchsafed to us, at last, a low, square heel to our boots and a\r\nbroad sole in which the five toes can spread themselves at pleasure.\r\nEvidently a new day of physical freedom is at last dawning for the most\r\ncribbed and crippled of Eve's unhappy daughters.\r\n\r\nIt was while living in Seneca Falls, and at one of the most despairing\r\nperiods of my young life, that one of the best gifts of the gods came to\r\nme in the form of a good, faithful housekeeper. She was indeed a\r\ntreasure, a friend and comforter, a second mother to my children, and\r\nunderstood all life's duties and gladly bore its burdens. She could fill\r\nany department in domestic life, and for thirty years was the joy of our\r\nhousehold. But for this noble, self-sacrificing woman, much of my public\r\nwork would have been quite impossible. If by word or deed I have made\r\nthe journey of life easier for any struggling soul, I must in justice\r\nshare the meed of praise accorded me with my little Quaker friend Amelia\r\nWillard.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of housekeepers--one that will get what they want,\r\nif in the range of human possibilities, and then accept the inevitable\r\ninconveniences with cheerfulness and heroism; the other, from a kind of\r\nchronic inertia and a fear of taking responsibility, accept everything\r\nas they find it, though with gentle, continuous complainings. The latter\r\nare called amiable women. Such a woman was our congressman's wife in\r\n1854, and, as I was the reservoir of all her sorrows, great and small, I\r\nbecame very weary of her amiable non-resistance. Among other domestic\r\ntrials, she had a kitchen stove that smoked and leaked, which could\r\nneither bake nor broil,--a worthless thing,--and too small for any\r\npurpose. Consequently half their viands were spoiled in the cooking, and\r\nthe cooks left in disgust, one after another.\r\n\r\nIn telling me, one day, of these kitchen misadventures, she actually\r\nshed tears, which so roused my sympathies that, with surprise, I\r\nexclaimed: \"Why do you not buy a new stove?\" To my unassisted common\r\nsense that seemed the most practical thing to do. \"Why,\" she replied, \"I\r\nhave never purchased a darning needle, to put the case strongly, without\r\nconsulting Mr. S., and he does not think a new stove necessary.\" \"What,\r\npray,\" said I, \"does he know about stoves, sitting in his easy-chair in\r\nWashington? If he had a dull old knife with broken blades, he would soon\r\nget a new one with which to sharpen his pens and pencils, and, if he\r\nattempted to cook a meal--granting he knew how--on your old stove, he\r\nwould set it out of doors the next hour. Now my advice to you is to buy\r\na new one this very day!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless me!\" she said, \"that would make him furious; he would blow me\r\nsky-high.\" \"Well,\" I replied, \"suppose he did go into a regular tantrum\r\nand use all the most startling expletives in the vocabulary for fifteen\r\nminutes! What is that compared with a good stove 365 days in the year?\r\nJust put all he could say on one side, and all the advantages you would\r\nenjoy on the other, and you must readily see that his wrath would kick\r\nthe beam.\" As my logic was irresistible, she said, \"Well, if you will go\r\nwith me, and help select a stove, I think I will take the\r\nresponsibility.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly we went to the hardware store and selected the most\r\napproved, largest-sized stove, with all the best cooking utensils, best\r\nRussian pipe, etc. \"Now,\" said she, \"I am in equal need of a good stove\r\nin my sitting room, and I would like the pipes of both stoves to lead\r\ninto dumb stoves above, and thus heat two or three rooms upstairs for my\r\nchildren to play in, as they have no place except the sitting room,\r\nwhere they must be always with me; but I suppose it is not best to do\r\ntoo much at one time.\" \"On the contrary,\" I replied, \"as your husband is\r\nwealthy, you had better get all you really need now. Mr. S. will\r\nprobably be no more surprised with two stoves than with one, and, as you\r\nexpect a hot scene over the matter, the more you get out of it the\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\nSo the stoves and pipes were ordered, holes cut through the ceiling, and\r\nall were in working order next day. The cook was delighted over her\r\nsplendid stove and shining tins, copper-bottomed tea kettle and boiler,\r\nand warm sleeping room upstairs; the children were delighted with their\r\nlarge playrooms, and madam jubilant with her added comforts and that\r\nnewborn feeling of independence one has in assuming responsibility.\r\n\r\nShe was expecting Mr. S. home in the holidays, and occasionally weakened\r\nat the prospect of what she feared might be a disagreeable encounter. At\r\nsuch times she came to consult with me, as to what she would say and do\r\nwhen the crisis arrived. Having studied the _genus homo_ alike on the\r\ndivine heights of exaltation and in the valleys of humiliation, I was\r\nable to make some valuable suggestions.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said I, \"when your husband explodes, as you think he will,\r\nneither say nor do anything; sit and gaze out of the window with that\r\nfar-away, sad look women know so well how to affect. If you can summon\r\ntears at pleasure, a few would not be amiss; a gentle shower, not enough\r\nto make the nose and eyes red or to detract from your beauty. Men cannot\r\nresist beauty and tears. Never mar their effect with anything bordering\r\non sobs and hysteria; such violent manifestations being neither refined\r\nnor artistic. A scene in which one person does the talking must be\r\nlimited in time. No ordinary man can keep at white heat fifteen minutes;\r\nif his victim says nothing, he will soon exhaust himself. Remember every\r\ntime you speak in the way of defense, you give him a new text on which\r\nto branch out again. If silence is ever golden, it is when a husband is\r\nin a tantrum.\"\r\n\r\nIn due time Mr. S. arrived, laden with Christmas presents, and Charlotte\r\ncame over to tell me that she had passed through the ordeal. I will give\r\nthe scene in her own words as nearly as possible. \"My husband came\r\nyesterday, just before dinner, and, as I expected him, I had all things\r\nin order. He seemed very happy to see me and the children, and we had a\r\ngay time looking at our presents and chatting about Washington and all\r\nthat had happened since we parted. It made me sad, in the midst of our\r\nhappiness, to think how soon the current of his feelings would change,\r\nand I wished in my soul that I had not bought the stoves. But, at last,\r\ndinner was announced, and I knew that the hour had come. He ran upstairs\r\nto give a few touches to his toilet, when lo! the shining stoves and\r\npipes caught his eyes. He explored the upper apartments and came down\r\nthe back stairs, glanced at the kitchen stove, then into the dining\r\nroom, and stood confounded, for a moment, before the nickel-plated\r\n'Morning Glory.' Then he exclaimed, 'Heavens and earth! Charlotte, what\r\nhave you been doing?' I remembered what you told me and said nothing,\r\nbut looked steadily out of the window. I summoned no tears, however, for\r\nI felt more like laughing than crying; he looked so ridiculous flying\r\nround spasmodically, like popcorn on a hot griddle, and talking as if\r\nmaking a stump speech on the corruptions of the Democrats. The first\r\ntime he paused to take breath I said, in my softest tones: 'William,\r\ndinner is waiting; I fear the soup will be cold.' Fortunately he was\r\nhungry, and that great central organ of life and happiness asserted its\r\nclaims on his attention, and he took his seat at the table. I broke what\r\nmight have been an awkward silence, chatting with the older children\r\nabout their school lessons. Fortunately they were late, and did not know\r\nwhat had happened, so they talked to their father and gradually restored\r\nhis equilibrium. We had a very good dinner, and I have not heard a word\r\nabout the stoves since. I suppose we shall have another scene when the\r\nbill is presented.\"\r\n\r\nA few years later, Horace Greeley came to Seneca Falls to lecture on\r\ntemperance. As he stayed with us, we invited Mr. S., among others, to\r\ndinner. The chief topic at the table was the idiosyncrasies of women.\r\nMr. Greeley told many amusing things about his wife, of her erratic\r\nmovements and sudden decisions to do and dare what seemed most\r\nimpracticable. Perhaps, on rising some morning, she would say: \"I think\r\nI'll go to Europe by the next steamer, Horace. Will you get tickets\r\nto-day for me, the nurse, and children?\" \"Well,\" said Mr. S., \"she must\r\nbe something like our hostess. Every time her husband goes away she cuts\r\na door or window. They have only ten doors to lock every night, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"and your own wife, too, Mrs. S., has the credit of some\r\nhigh-handed measures when you are in Washington.\" Then I told the whole\r\nstory, amid peals of laughter, just as related above. The dinner table\r\nscene fairly convulsed the Congressman. The thought that he had made\r\nsuch a fool of himself in the eyes of Charlotte that she could not even\r\nsummon a tear in her defense, particularly pleased him. When\r\nsufficiently recovered to speak, he said: \"Well, I never could\r\nunderstand how it was that Charlotte suddenly emerged from her thraldom\r\nand manifested such rare executive ability. Now I see to whom I am\r\nindebted for the most comfortable part of my married life. I am a\r\nthousand times obliged to you; you did just right and so did she, and\r\nshe has been a happier woman ever since. She now gets what she needs,\r\nand frets no more, to me, about ten thousand little things. How can a\r\nman know what implements are necessary for the work he never does? Of\r\nall agencies for upsetting the equanimity of family life, none can\r\nsurpass an old, broken-down kitchen stove!\"\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1861, just after the election of Lincoln, the\r\nabolitionists decided to hold a series of conventions in the chief\r\ncities of the North. All their available speakers were pledged for\r\nactive service. The Republican party, having absorbed the political\r\nabolitionists within its ranks by its declared hostility to the\r\nextension of slavery, had come into power with overwhelming majorities.\r\nHence the Garrisonian abolitionists, opposed to all compromises, felt\r\nthat this was the opportune moment to rouse the people to the necessity\r\nof holding that party to its declared principles, and pushing it, if\r\npossible, a step or two forward.\r\n\r\nI was invited to accompany Miss Anthony and Beriah Green to a few points\r\nin Central New York. But we soon found, by the concerted action of\r\nRepublicans all over the country, that anti-slavery conventions would\r\nnot be tolerated. Thus Republicans and Democrats made common cause\r\nagainst the abolitionists. The John Brown raid, the year before, had\r\nintimidated Northern politicians as much as Southern slaveholders, and\r\nthe general feeling was that the discussion of the question at the North\r\nshould be altogether suppressed.\r\n\r\nFrom Buffalo to Albany our experience was the same, varied only by the\r\nfertile resources of the actors and their surroundings. Thirty years of\r\neducation had somewhat changed the character of Northern mobs. They no\r\nlonger dragged men through the streets with ropes around their necks,\r\nnor broke up women's prayer meetings; they no longer threw eggs and\r\nbrickbats at the apostles of reform, nor dipped them in barrels of tar\r\nand feathers, they simply crowded the halls, and, with laughing,\r\ngroaning, clapping, and cheering, effectually interrupted the\r\nproceedings. Such was our experience during the two days we attempted to\r\nhold a convention in St. James' Hall, Buffalo. As we paid for the hall,\r\nthe mob enjoyed themselves, at our expense, in more ways than one. Every\r\nsession, at the appointed time, we took our places on the platform,\r\nmaking, at various intervals of silence, renewed efforts to speak. Not\r\nsucceeding, we sat and conversed with each other and the many friends\r\nwho crowded the platform and anterooms. Thus, among ourselves, we had a\r\npleasant reception and a discussion of many phases of the question that\r\nbrought us together. The mob not only vouchsafed to us the privilege of\r\ntalking to our friends without interruption, but delegations of their\r\nown came behind the scenes, from time to time, to discuss with us the\r\nright of free speech and the constitutionality of slavery.\r\n\r\nThese Buffalo rowdies were headed by ex-Justice Hinson, aided by younger\r\nmembers of the Fillmore and Seymour families, and the chief of police\r\nand fifty subordinates, who were admitted to the hall free, for the\r\nexpress purpose of protecting our right of free speech, but who, in\r\ndefiance of the mayor's orders, made not the slightest effort in our\r\ndefense. At Lockport there was a feeble attempt in the same direction.\r\nAt Albion neither hall, church, nor schoolhouse could be obtained, so we\r\nheld small meetings in the dining room of the hotel. At Rochester,\r\nCorinthian Hall was packed long before the hour advertised. This was a\r\ndelicately appreciative, jocose mob. At this point Aaron Powell joined\r\nus. As he had just risen from a bed of sickness, looking pale and\r\nemaciated, he slowly mounted the platform. The mob at once took in his\r\nlook of exhaustion, and, as he seated himself, they gave an audible\r\nsimultaneous sigh, as if to say, what a relief it is to be seated! So\r\ncompletely did the tender manifestation reflect Mr. Powell's apparent\r\ncondition that the whole audience burst into a roar of laughter. Here,\r\ntoo, all attempts to speak were futile. At Port Byron a generous\r\nsprinkling of cayenne pepper on the stove soon cut short all\r\nconstitutional arguments and paeans to liberty.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was all the way to Albany. The whole State was aflame with the\r\nmob spirit, and from Boston and various points in other States the same\r\nnews reached us. As the legislature was in session, and we were\r\nadvertised in Albany, a radical member sarcastically moved \"That as Mrs.\r\nStanton and Miss Anthony were about to move on Albany, the militia be\r\nordered out for the protection of the city.\" Happily, Albany could then\r\nboast of a Democratic mayor, a man of courage and conscience, who said\r\nthe right of free speech should never be trodden under foot where he had\r\nthe right to prevent it. And grandly did that one determined man\r\nmaintain order in his jurisdiction. Through all the sessions of the\r\nconvention Mayor Thatcher sat on the platform, his police stationed in\r\ndifferent parts of the hall and outside the building, to disperse the\r\ncrowd as fast as it collected. If a man or boy hissed or made the\r\nslightest interruption, he was immediately ejected. And not only did the\r\nmayor preserve order in the meetings, but, with a company of armed\r\npolice, he escorted us, every time, to and from the Delevan House. The\r\nlast night Gerrit Smith addressed the mob from the steps of the hotel,\r\nafter which they gave him three cheers and dispersed in good order.\r\n\r\nWhen proposing for the Mayor a vote of thanks, at the close of the\r\nconvention, Mr. Smith expressed his fears that it had been a severe\r\nordeal for him to listen to these prolonged anti-slavery discussions. He\r\nsmiled, and said: \"I have really been deeply interested and instructed.\r\nI rather congratulate myself that a convention of this character has, at\r\nlast, come in the line of my business; otherwise I should have probably\r\nremained in ignorance of many important facts and opinions I now\r\nunderstand and appreciate.\"\r\n\r\nWhile all this was going on publicly, an equally trying experience was\r\nprogressing, day by day, behind the scenes. Miss Anthony had been\r\ninstrumental in helping a much abused mother, with her child, to escape\r\nfrom a husband who had immured her in an insane asylum. The wife\r\nbelonged to one of the first families of New York, her brother being a\r\nUnited States senator, and the husband, also, a man of position; a large\r\ncircle of friends and acquaintances was interested in the result. Though\r\nshe was incarcerated in an insane asylum for eighteen months, yet\r\nmembers of her own family again and again testified that she was not\r\ninsane. Miss Anthony, knowing that she was not, and believing fully that\r\nthe unhappy mother was the victim of a conspiracy, would not reveal her\r\nhiding place.\r\n\r\nKnowing the confidence Miss Anthony felt in the wisdom of Mr. Garrison\r\nand Mr. Phillips, they were implored to use their influence with her to\r\ngive up the fugitives. Letters and telegrams, persuasions, arguments,\r\nand warnings from Mr. Garrison, Mr. Phillips, and the Senator on the one\r\nside, and from Lydia Mott, Mrs. Elizabeth F. Ellet, and Abby Hopper\r\nGibbons, on the other, poured in upon her, day after day; but Miss\r\nAnthony remained immovable, although she knew that she was defying and\r\nviolating the law and might be arrested any moment on the platform. We\r\nhad known so many aggravated cases of this kind that, in daily counsel,\r\nwe resolved that this woman should not be recaptured if it were possible\r\nto prevent it. To us it looked as imperative a duty to shield a sane\r\nmother, who had been torn from a family of little children and doomed to\r\nthe companionship of lunatics, and to aid her in fleeing to a place of\r\nsafety, as to help a fugitive from slavery to Canada. In both cases an\r\nunjust law was violated; in both cases the supposed owners of the\r\nvictims were defied; hence, in point of law and morals, the act was the\r\nsame in both cases. The result proved the wisdom of Miss Anthony's\r\ndecision, as all with whom Mrs. P. came in contact for years afterward,\r\nexpressed the opinion that she was, and always had been, perfectly sane.\r\nCould the dark secrets of insane asylums be brought to light we should\r\nbe shocked to know the great number of rebellious wives, sisters, and\r\ndaughters who are thus sacrificed to false customs and barbarous laws\r\nmade by men for women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nVIEWS ON MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe widespread discussion we are having, just now, on the subject of\r\nmarriage and divorce, reminds me of an equally exciting one in 1860. A\r\nvery liberal bill, introduced into the Indiana legislature by Robert\r\nDale Owen, and which passed by a large majority, roused much public\r\nthought on the question, and made that State free soil for unhappy wives\r\nand husbands. A similar bill was introduced into the legislature of New\r\nYork by Mr. Ramsey, which was defeated by four votes, owing, mainly, to\r\nthe intense opposition of Horace Greeley. He and Mr. Owen had a\r\nprolonged discussion, in the New York _Tribune_, in which Mr. Owen got\r\ndecidedly the better of the argument.\r\n\r\nThere had been several aggravated cases of cruelty to wives among the\r\nDutch aristocracy, so that strong influences in favor of the bill had\r\nbeen brought to bear on the legislature, but the _Tribune_ thundered\r\nevery morning in its editorial column its loudest peals, which\r\nreverberated through the State. So bitter was the opposition to divorce,\r\nfor any cause, that but few dared to take part in the discussion. I was\r\nthe only woman, for many years, who wrote and spoke on the question.\r\nArticles on divorce, by a number of women, recently published in the\r\n_North American Review_, are a sign of progress, showing that women dare\r\nspeak out now more freely on the relations that most deeply concern\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMy feelings had been stirred to their depths very early in life by the\r\nsufferings of a dear friend of mine, at whose wedding I was one of the\r\nbridesmaids. In listening to the facts in her case, my mind was fully\r\nmade up as to the wisdom of a liberal divorce law. We read Milton's\r\nessays on divorce, together, and were thoroughly convinced as to the\r\nright and duty not only of separation, but of absolute divorce. While\r\nthe New York bill was pending, I was requested, by Lewis Benedict, one\r\nof the committee who had the bill in charge, to address the legislature.\r\nI gladly accepted, feeling that here was an opportunity not only to\r\nsupport my friend in the step she had taken, but to make the path clear\r\nfor other unhappy wives who might desire to follow her example. I had no\r\nthought of the persecution I was drawing down on myself for thus\r\nattacking so venerable an institution. I was always courageous in saying\r\nwhat I saw to be true, for the simple reason that I never dreamed of\r\nopposition. What seemed to me to be right I thought must be equally\r\nplain to all other rational beings. Hence I had no dread of\r\ndenunciation. I was only surprised when I encountered it, and no number\r\nof experiences have, as yet, taught me to fear public opinion. What I\r\nsaid on divorce thirty-seven years ago seems quite in line with what\r\nmany say now. The trouble was not in what I said, but that I said it too\r\nsoon, and before the people were ready to hear it. It may be, however,\r\nthat I helped them to get ready; who knows?\r\n\r\nAs we were holding a woman suffrage convention in Albany, at the time\r\nappointed for the hearing, Ernestine L. Rose and Lucretia Mott briefly\r\nadded their views on the question. Although Mrs. Mott had urged Mrs.\r\nRose and myself to be as moderate as possible in our demands, she quite\r\nunconsciously made the most radical utterance of all, in saying that\r\nmarriage was a question beyond the realm of legislation, that must be\r\nleft to the parties themselves. We rallied Lucretia on her radicalism,\r\nand some of the journals criticised us severely; but the following\r\nletter shows that she had no thought of receding from her position:\r\n\r\n     \"Roadside, near Philadelphia,\r\n\r\n     \"4th Mo., 30th, '61.\r\n\r\n     \"My Dear Lydia Mott:\r\n\r\n     \"I have wished, ever since parting with thee and our other dear\r\n     friends in Albany, to send thee a line, and have only waited in the\r\n     hope of contributing a little 'substantial aid' toward your neat\r\n     and valuable 'depository.' The twenty dollars inclosed is from our\r\n     Female Anti-slavery Society.\r\n\r\n     \"I see the annual meeting, in New York, is not to be held this\r\n     spring. Sister Martha is here, and was expecting to attend both\r\n     anniversaries. But we now think the woman's rights meeting had\r\n     better not be attempted, and she has written Elizabeth C. Stanton\r\n     to this effect.\r\n\r\n     \"I was well satisfied with being at the Albany meeting. I have\r\n     since met with the following, from a speech of Lord Brougham's,\r\n     which pleased me, as being as radical as mine in your stately Hall\r\n     of Representatives:\r\n\r\n     \"'Before women can have any justice by the laws of England, there\r\n     must be a total reconstruction of the whole marriage system; for\r\n     any attempt to amend it would prove useless. The great charter, in\r\n     establishing the supremacy of law over prerogative, provides only\r\n     for justice between man and man; for woman nothing is left but\r\n     common law, accumulations and modifications of original Gothic and\r\n     Roman heathenism, which no amount of filtration through\r\n     ecclesiastical courts could change into Christian laws. They are\r\n     declared unworthy a Christian people by great jurists; still they\r\n     remain unchanged.'\r\n\r\n     \"So Elizabeth Stanton will see that I have authority for going to\r\n     the root of the evil.\r\n\r\n     \"Thine,\r\n\r\n     \"LUCRETIA MOTT.\"\r\n\r\nThose of us who met in Albany talked the matter over in regard to a free\r\ndiscussion of the divorce question at the coming convention in New York.\r\nIt was the opinion of those present that, as the laws on marriage and\r\ndivorce were very unequal for man and woman, this was a legitimate\r\nsubject for discussion on our platform; accordingly I presented a series\r\nof resolutions, at the annual convention, in New York city, to which I\r\nspoke for over an hour. I was followed by Antoinette L, Brown, who also\r\npresented a series of resolutions in opposition to mine. She was, in\r\nturn, answered by Ernestine L. Rose. Wendell Phillips then arose, and,\r\nin an impressive manner pronounced the whole discussion irrelevant to\r\nour platform, and moved that neither the speeches nor resolutions go on\r\nthe records of the convention. As I greatly admired Wendell Phillips,\r\nand appreciated his good opinion, I was surprised and humiliated to find\r\nmyself under the ban of his disapprobation. My face was scarlet, and I\r\ntrembled with mingled feelings of doubt and fear--doubt as to the\r\nwisdom of my position and fear lest the convention should repudiate the\r\nwhole discussion. My emotion was so apparent that Rev. Samuel\r\nLongfellow, a brother of the poet, who sat beside me, whispered in my\r\near, \"Nevertheless you are right, and the convention will sustain you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips said that as marriage concerned man and woman alike, and\r\nthe laws bore equally on them, women had no special ground for\r\ncomplaint, although, in my speech, I had quoted many laws to show the\r\nreverse. Mr. Garrison and Rev. Antoinette L. Brown were alike opposed to\r\nMr. Phillips' motion, and claimed that marriage and divorce were\r\nlegitimate subjects for discussion on our platform. Miss Anthony closed\r\nthe debate. She said: \"I hope Mr. Phillips will withdraw his motion that\r\nthese resolutions shall not appear on the records of the convention. I\r\nam very sure that it would be contrary to all parliamentary usage to say\r\nthat, when the speeches which enforced and advocated the resolutions are\r\nreported and published in the proceedings, the resolutions shall not be\r\nplaced there. And as to the point that this question does not belong to\r\nthis platform--from that I totally dissent. Marriage has ever been a\r\none-sided matter, resting most unequally upon the sexes. By it man gains\r\nall; woman loses all; tyrant law and lust reign supreme with him; meek\r\nsubmission and ready obedience alone befit her. Woman has never been\r\nconsulted; her wish has never been taken into consideration as regards\r\nthe terms of the marriage compact. By law, public sentiment, and\r\nreligion,--from the time of Moses down to the present day,--woman has\r\nnever been thought of other than as a piece of property, to be disposed\r\nof at the will and pleasure of man. And at this very hour, by our\r\nstatute books, by our (so-called) enlightened Christian civilization,\r\nshe has no voice whatever in saying what shall be the basis of the\r\nrelation. She must accept marriage as man proffers it, or not at all.\r\n\r\n\"And then, again, on Mr. Phillips' own ground, the discussion is\r\nperfectly in order, since nearly all the wrongs of which we complain\r\ngrow out of the inequality of the marriage laws, that rob the wife of\r\nthe right to herself and her children; that make her the slave of the\r\nman she marries. I hope, therefore, the resolutions will be allowed to\r\ngo out to the public; that there may be a fair report of the ideas which\r\nhave actually been presented here; that they may not be left to the\r\nmercy of the secular press, I trust the convention will not vote to\r\nforbid the publication of those resolutions with the proceedings.\"\r\n\r\nRev. William Hoisington (the blind preacher) followed Miss Anthony, and\r\nsaid: \"Publish all that you have done here, and let the public know it.\"\r\n\r\nThe question was then put, on the motion of Mr. Phillips, and it was\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Greeley, in commenting on the convention, took the same ground\r\nwith Mr. Phillips, that the laws on marriage and divorce were equal for\r\nman and woman, I answered them in the following letter to the New York\r\n_Tribune_.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Editor of the New York Tribune_:\r\n\r\n     \"Sir: At our recent National Woman's Rights Convention many were\r\n     surprised to hear Wendell Phillips object to the question of\r\n     marriage and divorce as irrelevant to our platform. He said: 'We\r\n     had no right to discuss here any laws or customs but those where\r\n     inequality existed for the sexes; that the laws on marriage and\r\n     divorce rested equally on man and woman; that he suffers, as much\r\n     as she possibly could, the wrongs and abuses of an ill-assorted\r\n     marriage.'\r\n\r\n     \"Now it must strike every careful thinker that an immense\r\n     difference rests in the fact that man has made the laws cunningly\r\n     and selfishly for his own purpose. From Coke down to Kent, who can\r\n     cite one clause of the marriage contract where woman has the\r\n     advantage? When man suffers from false legislation he has his\r\n     remedy in his own hands. Shall woman be denied the right of protest\r\n     against laws in which she had no voice; laws which outrage the\r\n     holiest affections of her nature; laws which transcend the limits\r\n     of human legislation, in a convention called for the express\r\n     purpose of considering her wrongs? He might as well object to a\r\n     protest against the injustice of hanging a woman, because capital\r\n     punishment bears equally on man and woman.\r\n\r\n     \"The contract of marriage is by no means equal. The law permits the\r\n     girl to marry at twelve years of age, while it requires several\r\n     years more of experience on the part of the boy. In entering this\r\n     compact, the man gives up nothing that he before possessed, he is a\r\n     man still; while the legal existence of the woman is suspended\r\n     during marriage, and, henceforth, she is known but in and through\r\n     the husband. She is nameless, purseless, childless--though a woman,\r\n     an heiress, and a mother.\r\n\r\n     \"Blackstone says: 'The husband and wife are one, and that one is\r\n     the husband.' Chancellor Kent, in his 'Commentaries' says: 'The\r\n     legal effects of marriage are generally deducible from the\r\n     principle of the common law, by which the husband and wife are\r\n     regarded as one person, and her legal existence and authority lost\r\n     or suspended during the continuance of the matrimonial union.'\r\n\r\n     \"The wife is regarded by all legal authorities as a _feme covert_,\r\n     placed wholly _sub potestate viri_. Her moral responsibility, even,\r\n     is merged in her husband. The law takes it for granted that the\r\n     wife lives in fear of her husband; that his command is her highest\r\n     law; hence a wife is not punishable for the theft committed in the\r\n     presence of her husband. An unmarried woman can make contracts, sue\r\n     and be sued, enjoy the rights of property, to her inheritance--to\r\n     her wages--to her person--to her children; but, in marriage, she is\r\n     robbed by law of all and every natural and civil right. Kent\r\n     further says: 'The disability of the wife to contract, so as to\r\n     bind herself, arises not from want of discretion, but because she\r\n     has entered into an indissoluble connection by which she is placed\r\n     under the power and protection of her husband.' She is possessed of\r\n     certain rights until she is married; then all are suspended, to\r\n     revive, again, the moment the breath goes out of the husband's\r\n     body. (See 'Cowen's Treatise,' vol. 2, p. 709.)\r\n\r\n     \"If the contract be equal, whence come the terms 'marital power,'\r\n     'marital rights,' 'obedience and restraint,' 'dominion and\r\n     control,' 'power and protection,' etc., etc.? Many cases are\r\n     stated, showing the exercise of a most questionable power over the\r\n     wife, sustained by the courts. (See 'Bishop on Divorce,' p. 489.)\r\n\r\n     \"The laws on divorce are quite as unequal as those on marriage;\r\n     yea, far more so. The advantages seem to be all on one side and the\r\n     penalties on the other. In case of divorce, if the husband be not\r\n     the guilty party, the wife goes out of the partnership penniless.\r\n     (Kent, vol. 2, p. 33; 'Bishop on Divorce,' p. 492.)\r\n\r\n     \"In New York, and some other States, the wife of the guilty husband\r\n     can now sue for a divorce in her own name, and the costs come out\r\n     of the husband's estate; but, in the majority of the States, she is\r\n     still compelled to sue in the name of another, as she has no means\r\n     for paying costs, even though she may have brought her thousands\r\n     into the partnership. 'The allowance to the innocent wife of _ad\r\n     interim_ alimony and money to sustain the suit, is not regarded as\r\n     a strict right in her, but of sound discretion in the court.'\r\n     ('Bishop on Divorce,' p. 581.)\r\n\r\n     \"'Many jurists,' says Kent, 'are of opinion that the adultery of\r\n     the husband ought not to be noticed or made subject to the same\r\n     animadversions as that of the wife, because it is not evidence of\r\n     such entire depravity nor equally injurious in its effects upon the\r\n     morals, good order, and happiness of the domestic life.\r\n     Montesquieu, Pothier, and Dr. Taylor all insist that the cases of\r\n     husband and wife ought to be distinguished, and that the violation\r\n     of the marriage vow, on the part of the wife, is the most\r\n     mischievous, and the prosecution ought to be confined to the\r\n     offense on her part. (\"Esprit des Lois,\" tom. 3, 186; \"Traité du\r\n     Contrat de Mariage,\" No. 516; \"Elements of Civil Law,\" p. 254).'\r\n\r\n     \"Say you, 'These are but the opinions of men'? On what else, I ask,\r\n     are the hundreds of women depending, who, this hour, demand in our\r\n     courts a release from burdensome contracts? Are not these delicate\r\n     matters left wholly to the discretion of courts? Are not young\r\n     women from the first families dragged into our courts,--into\r\n     assemblies of men exclusively,--the judges all men, the jurors all\r\n     men? No true woman there to shield them, by her presence, from\r\n     gross and impertinent questionings, to pity their misfortunes, or\r\n     to protest against their wrongs?\r\n\r\n     \"The administration of justice depends far more on the opinions of\r\n     eminent jurists than on law alone, for law is powerless when at\r\n     variance with public sentiment.\r\n\r\n     \"Do not the above citations clearly prove inequality? Are not the\r\n     very letter and spirit of the marriage contract based on the idea\r\n     of the supremacy of man as the keeper of woman's virtue--her sole\r\n     protector and support? Out of marriage, woman asks nothing, at this\r\n     hour, but the elective franchise. It is only in marriage that she\r\n     must demand her right to person, children, property, wages, life,\r\n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. How can we discuss all the\r\n     laws and conditions of marriage, without perceiving its essential\r\n     essence, end, and aim? Now, whether the institution of marriage be\r\n     human or divine, whether regarded as indissoluble by ecclesiastical\r\n     courts or dissoluble by civil courts, woman, finding herself\r\n     equally degraded in each and every phase of it, always the victim\r\n     of the institution, it is her right and her duty to sift the\r\n     relation and the compact through and through, until she finds out\r\n     the true cause of her false position. How can we go before the\r\n     legislatures of our respective States and demand new laws, or no\r\n     laws, on divorce, until we have some idea of what the true relation\r\n     is?\r\n\r\n     \"We decide the whole question of slavery by settling the sacred\r\n     rights of the individual. We assert that man cannot hold property\r\n     in man, and reject the whole code of laws that conflicts with the\r\n     self-evident truth of the assertion.\r\n\r\n     \"Again, I ask, is it possible to discuss all the laws of a\r\n     relation, and not touch the relation itself?\r\n\r\n     \"Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n     \"Elizabeth Cady Stanton.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion on the question of marriage and divorce occupied one\r\nentire session of the convention, and called down on us severe\r\ncriticisms from the metropolitan and State press. So alarming were the\r\ncomments on what had been said that I began to feel that I had\r\ninadvertently taken out the underpinning from the social system. Enemies\r\nwere unsparing in their denunciations, and friends ridiculed the whole\r\nproceeding. I was constantly called on for a definition of marriage and\r\nasked to describe home life as it would be when men changed their wives\r\nevery Christmas. Letters and newspapers poured in upon me, asking all\r\nmanner of absurd questions, until I often wept with vexation. So many\r\nthings, that I had neither thought nor said, were attributed to me that,\r\nat times, I really doubted my own identity.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the progress of events the excitement died away, the earth\r\nseemed to turn on its axis as usual, women were given in marriage,\r\nchildren were born, fires burned as brightly as ever at the domestic\r\naltars, and family life, to all appearances, was as stable as usual.\r\n\r\nPublic attention was again roused to this subject by the\r\nMcFarland-Richardson trial, in which the former shot the latter, being\r\njealous of his attentions to his wife. McFarland was a brutal,\r\nimprovident husband, who had completely alienated his wife's\r\naffections, while Mr. Richardson, who had long been a cherished\r\nacquaintance of the family, befriended the wife in the darkest days of\r\nher misery. She was a very refined, attractive woman, and a large circle\r\nof warm friends stood by her through the fierce ordeal of her husband's\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nThough McFarland did not deny that he killed Richardson, yet he was\r\nacquitted on the plea of insanity, and was, at the same time, made the\r\nlegal guardian of his child, a boy, then, twelve years of age, and\r\nwalked out of the court with him, hand in hand. What a travesty on\r\njustice and common sense that, while a man is declared too insane to be\r\nheld responsible for taking the life of another, he might still be\r\ncapable of directing the life and education of a child! And what an\r\ninsult to that intelligent mother, who had devoted twelve years of her\r\nlife to his care, while his worthless father had not provided for them\r\nthe necessaries of life!\r\n\r\nShe married Mr. Richardson on his deathbed. The ceremony was performed\r\nby Henry Ward Beecher and Rev. O.B. Frothingham, while such men as\r\nHorace Greeley and Joshua Leavitt witnessed the solemn service. Though\r\nno shadow had ever dimmed Mrs. Richardson's fair fame, yet she was\r\nrudely treated in the court and robbed of her child, though by far the\r\nmost fitting parent to be intrusted with his care.\r\n\r\nAs the indignation among women was general and at white heat with regard\r\nto her treatment, Miss Anthony suggested to me, one day, that it would\r\nbe a golden opportunity to give women a lesson on their helplessness\r\nunder the law--wholly in the power of man as to their domestic\r\nrelations, as well as to their civil and political rights. Accordingly\r\nwe decided to hold some meetings, for women alone, to protest against\r\nthe decision of this trial, the general conduct of the case, the tone of\r\nthe press, and the laws that made it possible to rob a mother of her\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nMany ladies readily enlisted in the movement. I was invited to make the\r\nspeech on the occasion, and Miss Anthony arranged for two great\r\nmeetings, one in Apollo Hall, New York city, and one in the Academy of\r\nMusic, in Brooklyn. The result was all that we could desire. Miss\r\nAnthony, with wonderful executive ability, made all the arrangements,\r\ntaking on her own shoulders the whole financial responsibility.\r\n\r\nMy latest thought on this question I gave in _The Arena_ of April, 1894,\r\nfrom which I quote the following:\r\n\r\n     \"There is a demand just now for an amendment to the United States\r\n     Constitution that shall make the laws of marriage and divorce the\r\n     same in all the States of the Union. As the suggestion comes\r\n     uniformly from those who consider the present divorce laws too\r\n     liberal, we may infer that the proposed national law is to place\r\n     the whole question on a narrower basis, rendering null and void the\r\n     laws that have been passed in a broader spirit, according to the\r\n     needs and experiences, in certain sections, of the sovereign\r\n     people. And here let us bear in mind that the widest possible law\r\n     would not make divorce obligatory on anyone, while a restricted\r\n     law, on the contrary, would compel many, marrying, perhaps, under\r\n     more liberal laws, to remain in uncongenial relations.\r\n\r\n     \"As we are still in the experimental stage on this question, we are\r\n     not qualified to make a perfect law that would work satisfactorily\r\n     over so vast an area as our boundaries now embrace. I see no\r\n     evidence in what has been published on this question, of late, by\r\n     statesmen, ecclesiastics, lawyers, and judges, that any of them\r\n     have thought sufficiently on the subject to prepare a well-digested\r\n     code, or a comprehensive amendment to the national Constitution.\r\n     Some view it as a civil contract, though not governed by the laws\r\n     of other contracts; some view it as a religious ordinance--a\r\n     sacrament; some think it a relation to be regulated by the State,\r\n     others by the Church, and still others think it should be left\r\n     wholly to the individual. With this wide divergence of opinion\r\n     among our leading minds, it is quite evident that we are not\r\n     prepared for a national law.\r\n\r\n     \"Moreover, as woman is the most important factor in the marriage\r\n     relation, her enfranchisement is the primal step in deciding the\r\n     basis of family life. Before public opinion on this question\r\n     crystallizes into an amendment to the national Constitution, the\r\n     wife and mother must have a voice in the governing power and must\r\n     be heard, on this great problem, in the halls of legislation.\r\n\r\n     \"There are many advantages in leaving all these questions, as now,\r\n     to the States. Local self-government more readily permits of\r\n     experiments on mooted questions, which are the outcome of the needs\r\n     and convictions of the community. The smaller the area over which\r\n     legislation extends, the more pliable are the laws. By leaving the\r\n     States free to experiment in their local affairs, we can judge of\r\n     the working of different laws under varying circumstances, and thus\r\n     learn their comparative merits. The progress education has achieved\r\n     in America is due to the fact that we have left our system of\r\n     public instruction in the hands of local authorities. How\r\n     different would be the solution of the great educational question\r\n     of manual labor in the schools, if the matter had to be settled at\r\n     Washington!\r\n\r\n     \"The whole nation might find itself pledged to a scheme that a few\r\n     years would prove wholly impracticable. Not only is the town\r\n     meeting, as Emerson says, 'the cradle of American liberties,' but\r\n     it is the nursery of Yankee experiment and wisdom. England, with\r\n     its clumsy national code of education, making one inflexible\r\n     standard of scholarship for the bright children of the\r\n     manufacturing districts and the dull brains of the agricultural\r\n     counties, should teach us a lesson as to the wisdom of keeping\r\n     apart state and national government.\r\n\r\n     \"Before we can decide the just grounds for divorce, we must get a\r\n     clear idea of what constitutes marriage. In a true relation the\r\n     chief object is the loving companionship of man and woman, their\r\n     capacity for mutual help and happiness and for the development of\r\n     all that is noblest in each other. The second object is the\r\n     building up a home and family, a place of rest, peace, security, in\r\n     which child-life can bud and blossom like flowers in the sunshine.\r\n\r\n     \"The first step toward making the ideal the real, is to educate our\r\n     sons and daughters into the most exalted ideas of the sacredness of\r\n     married life and the responsibilities of parenthood. I would have\r\n     them give, at least, as much thought to the creation of an immortal\r\n     being as the artist gives to his landscape or statue. Watch him in\r\n     his hours of solitude, communing with great Nature for days and\r\n     weeks in all her changing moods, and when at last his dream of\r\n     beauty is realized and takes a clearly defined form, behold how\r\n     patiently he works through long months and years on sky and lake,\r\n     on tree and flower; and when complete, it represents to him more\r\n     love and life, more hope and ambition, than the living child at his\r\n     side, to whose conception and antenatal development not one soulful\r\n     thought was ever given. To this impressible period of human life,\r\n     few parents give any thought; yet here we must begin to cultivate\r\n     virtues that can alone redeem the world.\r\n\r\n     \"The contradictory views in which woman is represented are as\r\n     pitiful as varied. While the Magnificat to the Virgin is chanted in\r\n     all our cathedrals round the globe on each returning Sabbath day,\r\n     and her motherhood extolled by her worshipers, maternity for the\r\n     rest of womankind is referred to as a weakness, a disability, a\r\n     curse, an evidence of woman's divinely ordained subjection. Yet\r\n     surely the real woman should have some points of resemblance in\r\n     character and position with the ideal one, whom poets, novelists,\r\n     and artists portray.\r\n\r\n     \"It is folly to talk of the sacredness of marriage and maternity,\r\n     while the wife is practically regarded as an inferior, a subject, a\r\n     slave. Having decided that companionship and conscientious\r\n     parenthood are the only true grounds for marriage, if the relation\r\n     brings out the worst characteristics of each party, or if the home\r\n     atmosphere is unwholesome for children, is not the very _raison\r\n     d'être_ of the union wanting, and the marriage practically\r\n     annulled? It cannot be called a holy relation,--no, not a desirable\r\n     one,--when love and mutual respect are wanting. And let us bear in\r\n     mind one other important fact: the lack of sympathy and content in\r\n     the parents indicates radical physical unsuitability, which\r\n     results in badly organized offspring. If, then, the real object of\r\n     marriage is defeated, it is for the interest of the State, as well\r\n     as the individual concerned, to see that all such pernicious unions\r\n     be legally dissolved. Inasmuch, then, as incompatibility of temper\r\n     defeats the two great objects of marriage, it should be the primal\r\n     cause for divorce.\r\n\r\n     \"The true standpoint from which to view this question is individual\r\n     sovereignty, individual happiness. It is often said that the\r\n     interests of society are paramount, and first to be considered.\r\n     This was the Roman idea, the Pagan idea, that the individual was\r\n     made for the State. The central idea of barbarism has ever been the\r\n     family, the tribe, the nation--never the individual. But the great\r\n     doctrine of Christianity is the right of individual conscience and\r\n     judgment. The reason it took such a hold on the hearts of the\r\n     people was because it taught that the individual was primary; the\r\n     State, the Church, society, the family, secondary. However, a\r\n     comprehensive view of any question of human interest, shows that\r\n     the highest good and happiness of the individual and society lie in\r\n     the same direction.\r\n\r\n     \"The question of divorce, like marriage, should be settled, as to\r\n     its most sacred relations, by the parties themselves; neither the\r\n     State nor the Church having any right to intermeddle therein. As to\r\n     property and children, it must be viewed and regulated as a civil\r\n     contract. Then the union should be dissolved with at least as much\r\n     deliberation and publicity as it was formed. There might be some\r\n     ceremony and witnesses to add to the dignity and solemnity of the\r\n     occasion. Like the Quaker marriage, which the parties conduct\r\n     themselves, so, in this case, without any statement of their\r\n     disagreements, the parties might simply declare that, after living\r\n     together for several years, they found themselves unsuited to each\r\n     other, and incapable of making a happy home.\r\n\r\n     \"If divorce were made respectable, and recognized by society as a\r\n     duty, as well as a right, reasonable men and women could arrange\r\n     all the preliminaries, often, even, the division of property and\r\n     guardianship of children, quite as satisfactorily as it could be\r\n     done in the courts. Where the mother is capable of training the\r\n     children, a sensible father would leave them to her care rather\r\n     than place them in the hands of a stranger.\r\n\r\n     \"But, where divorce is not respectable, men who have no paternal\r\n     feeling will often hold the child, not so much for its good or his\r\n     own affection, as to punish the wife for disgracing him. The love\r\n     of children is not strong in most men, and they feel but little\r\n     responsibility in regard to them. See how readily they turn off\r\n     young sons to shift for themselves, and, unless the law compelled\r\n     them to support their illegitimate children, they would never give\r\n     them a second thought. But on the mother-soul rest forever the care\r\n     and responsibility of human life. Her love for the child born out\r\n     of wedlock is often intensified by the infinite pity she feels\r\n     through its disgrace. Even among the lower animals we find the\r\n     female ever brooding over the young and helpless.\r\n\r\n     \"Limiting the causes of divorce to physical defects or\r\n     delinquencies; making the proceedings public; prying into all the\r\n     personal affairs of unhappy men and women; regarding the step as\r\n     quasi criminal; punishing the guilty party in the suit; all this\r\n     will not strengthen frail human nature, will not insure happy\r\n     homes, will not banish scandals and purge society of prostitution.\r\n\r\n     \"No, no; the enemy of marriage, of the State, of society is not\r\n     liberal divorce laws, but the unhealthy atmosphere that exists in\r\n     the home itself. A legislative act cannot make a unit of a divided\r\n     family.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nWOMEN AS PATRIOTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 15, 1861, the President of the United States called out\r\nseventy-five thousand militia, and summoned Congress to meet July 4,\r\nwhen four hundred thousand men were called for, and four hundred\r\nmillions of dollars were voted to suppress the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nThese startling events roused the entire people, and turned the current\r\nof their thoughts in new directions. While the nation's life hung in the\r\nbalance, and the dread artillery of war drowned, alike, the voices of\r\ncommerce, politics, religion, and reform, all hearts were filled with\r\nanxious forebodings, all hands were busy in solemn preparations for the\r\nawful tragedies to come.\r\n\r\nAt this eventful hour the patriotism of woman shone forth as fervently\r\nand spontaneously as did that of man; and her self-sacrifice and\r\ndevotion were displayed in as many varied fields of action. While he\r\nbuckled on his knapsack and marched forth to conquer the enemy, she\r\nplanned the campaigns which brought the nation victory; fought in the\r\nranks, when she could do so without detection; inspired the sanitary\r\ncommission; gathered needed supplies for the grand army; provided nurses\r\nfor the hospitals; comforted the sick; smoothed the pillows of the\r\ndying; inscribed the last messages of lave to those far away; and marked\r\nthe resting places where the brave men fell. The labor women\r\naccomplished, the hardships they endured, the time and strength they\r\nsacrificed in the War that summoned three million men to arms, can never\r\nbe fully appreciated.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we may safely say that there is scarcely a loyal woman in the\r\nNorth who did not do something in aid of the cause; who did not\r\ncontribute time, labor, and money to the comfort of our soldiers and the\r\nsuccess of our arms. The story of the War will never be fully written if\r\nthe achievements of women are left untold. They do not figure in the\r\nofficial reports; they are not gazetted for gallant deeds; the names of\r\nthousands are unknown beyond the neighborhood where they lived, or the\r\nhospitals where they loved to labor; yet there is no feature in our War\r\nmore creditable to us as a nation, none from its positive newness so\r\nwell worthy of record.\r\n\r\nWhile the mass of women never philosophize on the principles that\r\nunderlie national existence, there were those in our late War who\r\nunderstood the political significance of the struggle; the\r\n\"irrepressible conflict\" between freedom and slavery, between National\r\nand State rights. They saw that to provide lint, bandages, and supplies\r\nfor the army, while the War was not conducted on a wise policy, was to\r\nlabor in vain; and while many organizations, active, vigilant, and\r\nself-sacrificing, were multiplied to look after the material wants of\r\nthe army, these few formed themselves into a National Loyal League, to\r\nteach sound principles of government and to impress on the nation's\r\nconscience that freedom for the slaves was the only way to victory.\r\nAccustomed, as most women had been to works of charity and to the relief\r\nof outward suffering, it was difficult to rouse their enthusiasm for an\r\nidea, to persuade them to labor for a principle. They clamored for\r\npractical work, something for their hands to do; for fairs and sewing\r\nsocieties to raise money for soldier's families, for tableaux, readings,\r\ntheatricals--anything but conventions to discuss principles and to\r\ncirculate petitions for emancipation. They could not see that the best\r\nservice they could render the army was to suppress the Rebellion, and\r\nthat the most effective way to accomplish that was to transform the\r\nslaves into soldiers. This Woman's Loyal League voiced the solemn\r\nlessons of the War: Liberty to all; national protection for every\r\ncitizen under our flag; universal suffrage, and universal amnesty.\r\n\r\nAfter consultation with Horace Greeley, William Lloyd Garrison, Governor\r\nAndrews, and Robert Dale Owen, Miss Anthony and I decided to call a\r\nmeeting of women in Cooper Institute and form a Woman's Loyal League, to\r\nadvocate the immediate emancipation and enfranchisement of the Southern\r\nslaves, as the most speedy way of ending the War, so we issued, in tract\r\nform, and extensively circulated the following call:\r\n\r\n     \"In this crisis of our country's destiny, it is the duty of every\r\n     citizen to consider the peculiar blessings of a republican form of\r\n     government, and decide what sacrifices of wealth and life are\r\n     demanded for its defense and preservation. The policy of the War,\r\n     our whole future life, depend on a clearly defined idea of the end\r\n     proposed and the immense advantages to be secured to ourselves and\r\n     all mankind by its accomplishment. No mere party or sectional cry,\r\n     no technicalities of constitutional or military law, no mottoes of\r\n     craft or policy are big enough to touch the great heart of a nation\r\n     in the midst of revolution. A grand idea--such as freedom or\r\n     justice--is needful to kindle and sustain the fires of a high\r\n     enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n     \"At this hour, the best word and work of every man and woman are\r\n     imperatively demanded. To man, by common consent, are assigned the\r\n     forum, camp, and field. What is woman's legitimate work and how she\r\n     may best accomplish it, is worthy our earnest counsel one with\r\n     another. We have heard many complaints of the lack of enthusiasm,\r\n     among Northern women; but when a mother lays her son on the altar\r\n     of her country, she asks an object equal to the sacrifice. In\r\n     nursing the sick and wounded, knitting socks, scraping lint, and\r\n     making jellies the bravest and best may weary if the thoughts mount\r\n     not in faith to something beyond and above it all. Work is worship\r\n     only when a noble purpose fills the soul. Woman is equally\r\n     interested and responsible with man in the final settlement of this\r\n     problem of self-government; therefore let none stand idle\r\n     spectators now. When every hour is big with destiny, and each delay\r\n     but complicates our difficulties, it is high time for the daughters\r\n     of the Revolution, in solemn council, to unseal the last will and\r\n     testaments of the fathers, lay hold of their birthright of freedom,\r\n     and keep it a sacred trust for all coming generations.\r\n\r\n     \"To this end we ask the Loyal Women of the Nation to meet in the\r\n     Church of the Puritans (Dr. Cheever's), New York, on Thursday, the\r\n     14th of May next.\r\n\r\n     \"Let the women of every State be largely represented in person or\r\n     by letter.\r\n\r\n     \"On behalf of the Woman's Central Committee,\r\n\r\n     \"Elizabeth Cady Stanton,\r\n\r\n     \"Susan B. Anthony.\"\r\n\r\nAmong other resolutions adopted at the meeting were the following:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, There never can be a true peace in this Republic until the\r\ncivil and political rights of all citizens of African descent and all\r\nwomen are practically established.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the women of the Revolution were not wanting in\r\nheroism and self-sacrifice, and we, their daughters, are ready, in this\r\nWar, to pledge our time, our means, our talents, and our lives, if need\r\nbe, to secure the final and complete consecration of America to\r\nfreedom.\"\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that the practical work to be done to secure freedom for\r\nthe slaves was to circulate petitions through all the Northern States.\r\nFor months these petitions were circulated diligently everywhere, as the\r\nsignatures show--some signed on fence posts, plows, the anvil, the\r\nshoemaker's bench--by women of fashion and those in the industries,\r\nalike in the parlor and the kitchen; by statesmen, professors in\r\ncolleges, editors, bishops; by sailors, and soldiers, and the\r\nhard-handed children of toil, building railroads and bridges, and\r\ndigging canals, and in mines in the bowels of the earth. Petitions,\r\nsigned by three hundred thousand persons, can now be seen in the\r\nnational archives in the Capitol at Washington. Three of my sons spent\r\nweeks in our office in Cooper Institute, rolling up the petitions from\r\neach State separately, and inscribing on the outside the number of names\r\nof men and women contained therein. We sent appeals to the President the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and the Senate, from time to time, urging\r\nemancipation and the passage of the proposed Thirteenth, Fourteenth,\r\nand Fifteenth Amendments to the National Constitution. During these\r\neventful months we received many letters from Senator Sumner, saying,\r\n\"Send on the petitions as fast as received; they give me opportunities\r\nfor speech.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Dale Owen, chairman of the Freedman's Commission, was most\r\nenthusiastic in the work of the Loyal League, and came to our rooms\r\nfrequently to suggest new modes of agitation and to give us an inkling\r\nof what was going on behind the scenes in Washington. Those who had been\r\nspecially engaged in the Woman Suffrage movement suspended their\r\nconventions during the war, and gave their time and thought wholly to\r\nthe vital issues of the hour. Seeing the political significance of the\r\nwar, they urged the emancipation of the slaves as the sure, quick way of\r\ncutting the Gordian knot of the Rebellion. To this end they organized a\r\nnational league, and rolled up a mammoth petition, urging Congress so to\r\namend the Constitution as to prohibit the existence of slavery in the\r\nUnited States. From their headquarters in Cooper Institute, New York\r\ncity, they sent out the appeals to the President, Congress, and the\r\npeople at large; tracts and forms of petition, franked by members of\r\nCongress, were scattered like snowflakes from Maine to Texas. Meetings\r\nwere held every week, in which the policy of the Government was freely\r\ndiscussed, and approved or condemned.\r\n\r\nThat this League did a timely educational work is manifested by the\r\nletters received from generals, statesmen, editors, and from women in\r\nmost of the Northern States, fully indorsing its action and principles.\r\nThe clearness to thinking women of the cause of the War; the true\r\npolicy in waging it; their steadfastness in maintaining the principles\r\nof freedom, are worthy of consideration. With this League abolitionists\r\nand Republicans heartily co-operated. A course of lectures was delivered\r\nfor its benefit in Cooper Institute, by such men as Horace Greeley,\r\nGeorge William Curtis, William D. Kelly, Wendell Phillips, E.P. Whipple,\r\nFrederick Douglass, Theodore D. Weld, Rev. Dr. Tyng, and Dr. Bellows.\r\nMany letters are on its files from Charles Sumner, approving its\r\nmeasures, and expressing great satisfaction at the large number of\r\nemancipation petitions being rolled into Congress. The Republican press,\r\ntoo, was highly complimentary. The New York Tribune said: \"The women of\r\nthe Loyal League have shown great practical wisdom in restricting their\r\nefforts to one subject, the most important which any society can aim at\r\nin this hour, and great courage in undertaking to do what never has been\r\ndone in the world before, to obtain one million of names to a petition.\"\r\n\r\nThe leading journals vied with each other in praising the patience and\r\nprudence, the executive ability, the loyalty, and the patriotism of the\r\nwomen of the League, and yet these were the same women who, when\r\ndemanding civil and political rights, privileges, and immunities for\r\nthemselves, had been uniformly denounced as \"unwise,\" \"imprudent,\"\r\n\"fanatical,\" and \"impracticable.\" During the six years they held their\r\nown claims in abeyance to those of the slaves of the South, and labored\r\nto inspire the people with enthusiasm for the great measures of the\r\nRepublican party, they were highly honored as \"wise, loyal, and\r\nclear-sighted.\" But when the slaves were emancipated, and these women\r\nasked that they should be recognized in the reconstruction as citizens\r\nof the Republic, equal before the law, all these transcendent virtues\r\nvanished like dew before the morning sun. And thus it ever is: so long\r\nas woman labors to second man's endeavors and exalt his sex above her\r\nown, her virtues pass unquestioned; but when she dares to demand rights\r\nand privileges for herself, her motives, manners, dress, personal\r\nappearance, and character are subjects for ridicule and detraction.\r\n\r\nLiberty, victorious over slavery on the battlefield, had now more\r\npowerful enemies to encounter at Washington. The slaves set free, the\r\nmaster conquered, the South desolate; the two races standing face to\r\nface, sharing alike the sad results of war, turned with appealing looks\r\nto the general government, as if to say, \"How stand we now?\" \"What\r\nnext?\" Questions our statesmen, beset with dangers, with fears for the\r\nnation's life, of party divisions, of personal defeat, were wholly\r\nunprepared to answer. The reconstruction of the South involved the\r\nreconsideration of the fundamental principles of our Government and the\r\nnatural rights of man. The nation's heart was thrilled with prolonged\r\ndebates in Congress and State legislatures, in the pulpits and public\r\njournals, and at every fireside on these vital questions, which took\r\nfinal shape in the three historic amendments to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe first point, his emancipation, settled, the political status of the\r\nnegro was next in order; and to this end various propositions were\r\nsubmitted to Congress. But to demand his enfranchisement on the broad\r\nprinciple of natural rights was hedged about with difficulties, as the\r\nlogical result of such action must be the enfranchisement of all\r\nostracized classes; not only the white women of the entire country, but\r\nthe slave women of the South. Though our senators and representatives\r\nhad an honest aversion to any proscriptive legislation against loyal\r\nwomen, in view of their varied and self-sacrificing work during the War,\r\nyet the only way they could open the constitutional door just wide\r\nenough to let the black man pass in was to introduce the word \"male\"\r\ninto the national Constitution. After the generous devotion of such\r\nwomen as Anna Carroll and Anna Dickinson in sustaining the policy of the\r\nRepublicans, both in peace and war, they felt it would come with a bad\r\ngrace from that party to place new barriers in woman's path to freedom.\r\nBut how could the amendment be written without the word \"male,\" was the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nRobert Dale Owen being at Washington, and behind the scenes at the time,\r\nsent copies of the various bills to the officers of the Loyal League, in\r\nNew York, and related to us some of the amusing discussions. One of the\r\ncommittee proposed \"persons\" instead of \"males.\" \"That will never do,\"\r\nsaid another, \"it would enfranchise wenches.\" \"Suffrage for black men\r\nwill be all the strain the Republican party can stand,\" said another.\r\nCharles Sumner said, years afterward, that he wrote over nineteen pages\r\nof foolscap to get rid of the word \"male\" and yet keep \"negro suffrage\"\r\nas a party measure intact; but it could not be done.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony and I were the first to see the full significance of the\r\nword \"male\" in the Fourteenth Amendment, and we at once sounded the\r\nalarm, and sent out petitions for a constitutional amendment to\r\n\"prohibit the States from disfranchising any of their citizens on the\r\nground of sex.\" Miss Anthony, who had spent the year in Kansas, started\r\nfor New York the moment she saw the proposition before Congress to put\r\nthe word \"male\" into the national Constitution, and made haste to rouse\r\nthe women in the East to the fact that the time had come to begin\r\nvigorous work again for woman's enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nLeaving Rochester, October 11, she called on Martha Wright at Auburn;\r\nPhebe Jones and Lydia Mott at Albany; Mmes. Rose, Gibbons, Davis, at New\r\nYork city; Lucy Stone and Antoinette Brown Blackwell in New Jersey;\r\nStephen and Abby Foster at Worcester; Mmes. Severance, Dall, Nowell, Dr.\r\nHarriet K. Hunt, Dr. M.E. Zackesewska, and Messrs. Phillips and Garrison\r\nin Boston, urging them to join in sending protests to Washington against\r\nthe pending legislation. Mr. Phillips at once consented to devote five\r\nhundred dollars from the \"Jackson Fund\" to commence the work. Miss\r\nAnthony and I spent all our Christmas holidays in writing letters and\r\naddressing appeals and petitions to every part of the country, and,\r\nbefore the close of the session of 1865-66, petitions with ten thousand\r\nsignatures were poured into Congress.\r\n\r\nOne of my letters was as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Editor of the Standard_:\r\n\r\n     \"Sir: Mr. Broomall of Pennsylvania, Mr. Schenck of Ohio, Mr.\r\n     Jenckes of Rhode Island, and Mr. Stevens of Pennsylvania, have each\r\n     a resolution before Congress to amend the Constitution.\r\n\r\n     \"Article First, Section Second, reads thus: 'Representatives and\r\n     direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which\r\n     may be included within this Union, according to their respective\r\n     numbers.'\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Broomall proposes to amend by saying, 'male electors'; Mr.\r\n     Schenck,'male citizens'; Mr. Jenckes, 'male citizens'; Mr. Stevens,\r\n     'male voters,' as, in process of time, women may be made 'legal\r\n     voters' in the several States, and would then meet that requirement\r\n     of the Constitution. But those urged by the other gentlemen,\r\n     neither time, effort, nor State Constitutions could enable us to\r\n     meet, unless, by a liberal interpretation of the amendment, a coat\r\n     of mail to be worn at the polls might be judged all-sufficient. Mr.\r\n     Jenckes and Mr. Schenck, in their bills, have the grace not to say\r\n     a word about taxes, remembering, perhaps, that 'taxation without\r\n     representation is tyranny.' But Mr. Broomall, though unwilling that\r\n     we should share in the honors of government, would fain secure us a\r\n     place in its burdens; for, while he apportions representatives to\r\n     \"male electors\" only, he admits \"all the inhabitants\" into the\r\n     rights, privileges, and immunities of taxation. Magnanimous M.C.!\r\n\r\n     \"I would call the attention of the women of the nation to the fact\r\n     that, under the Federal Constitution, as it now exists, there is\r\n     not one word that limits the right of suffrage to any privileged\r\n     class. This attempt to turn the wheels of civilization backward, on\r\n     the part of Republicans claiming to be the liberal party, should\r\n     rouse every woman in the nation to a prompt exercise of the only\r\n     right she has in the Government, the right of petition. To this end\r\n     a committee in New York have sent out thousands of petitions, which\r\n     should be circulated in every district and sent to its\r\n     representative at Washington as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n     \"Elizabeth Cady Stanton.\r\n\r\n     \"New York, January 2, 1866.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nPIONEER LIFE IN KANSAS--OUR NEWSPAPER, \"THE REVOLUTION.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the proposition to extend the suffrage to women and to colored\r\nmen was submitted to the people of the State of Kansas, and, among other\r\nEastern speakers, I was invited to make a campaign through the State. As\r\nthe fall elections were pending, there was great excitement everywhere.\r\nSuffrage for colored men was a Republican measure, which the press and\r\npoliticians of that party advocated with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAs woman suffrage was not a party question, we hoped that all parties\r\nwould favor the measure; that we might, at last, have one green spot on\r\nearth where women could enjoy full liberty as citizens of the United\r\nStates. Accordingly, in July, Miss Anthony and I started, with high\r\nhopes of a most successful trip, and, after an uneventful journey of one\r\nthousand five hundred miles, we reached the sacred soil where John Brown\r\nand his sons had helped to fight the battles that made Kansas a free\r\nState.\r\n\r\nLucy Stone, Mr. Blackwell, and Olympia Brown had preceded us and opened\r\nthe campaign with large meetings in all the chief cities. Miss Anthony\r\nand I did the same. Then it was decided that, as we were to go to the\r\nvery borders of the State, where there were no railroads, we must take\r\ncarriages, and economize our forces by taking different routes. I was\r\nescorted by ex-Governor Charles Robinson. We had a low, easy carriage,\r\ndrawn by two mules, in which we stored about a bushel of tracts, two\r\nvalises, a pail for watering the mules, a basket of apples, crackers,\r\nand other such refreshments as we could purchase on the way. Some things\r\nwere suspended underneath the carriage, some packed on behind, and some\r\nunder the seat and at our feet. It required great skill to compress the\r\nnecessary baggage into the allotted space. As we went to the very verge\r\nof civilization, wherever two dozen voters could be assembled, we had a\r\ntaste of pioneer life. We spoke in log cabins, in depots, unfinished\r\nschoolhouses, churches, hotels, barns, and in the open air.\r\n\r\nI spoke in a large mill one night. A solitary tallow candle shone over\r\nmy head like a halo of glory; a few lanterns around the outskirts of the\r\naudience made the darkness perceptible; but all I could see of my\r\naudience was the whites of their eyes in the dim distance. People came\r\nfrom twenty miles around to these meetings, held either in the morning,\r\nafternoon, or evening, as was most convenient.\r\n\r\nAs the regular State election was to take place in the coming November,\r\nthe interest increased from week to week, until the excitement of the\r\npeople knew no bounds. There were speakers for and against every\r\nproposition before the people. This involved frequent debates on all the\r\ngeneral principles of government, and thus a great educational work was\r\naccomplished, which is one of the advantages of our frequent elections.\r\n\r\nThe friends of woman suffrage were doomed to disappointment. Those in\r\nthe East, on whom they relied for influence through the liberal\r\nnewspapers, were silent, and we learned, afterward, that they used what\r\ninfluence they had to keep the abolitionists and Republicans of the\r\nState silent, as they feared the discussion of the woman question would\r\njeopardize the enfranchisement of the black man. However, we worked\r\nuntiringly and hopefully, not seeing through the game of the politicians\r\nuntil nearly the end of the canvass, when we saw that our only chance\r\nwas in getting the Democratic vote. Accordingly, George Francis Train,\r\nthen a most effective and popular speaker, was invited into the State to\r\nsee what could be done to win the Democracy. He soon turned the tide,\r\nstrengthened the weak-kneed Republicans and abolitionists, and secured a\r\nlarge Democratic vote.\r\n\r\nFor three months we labored diligently, day after day, enduring all\r\nmanner of discomforts in traveling, eating, and sleeping. As there were\r\nno roads or guide-posts, we often lost our way. In going through cañons\r\nand fording streams it was often so dark that the Governor was obliged\r\nto walk ahead to find the way, taking off his coat so that I could see\r\nhis white shirt and slowly drive after him. Though seemingly calm and\r\ncool, I had a great dread of these night adventures, as I was in\r\nconstant fear of being upset on some hill and rolled into the water. The\r\nGovernor often complimented me on my courage, when I was fully aware of\r\nbeing tempest-tossed with anxiety. I am naturally very timid, but, being\r\nsilent under strong emotions of either pleasure or pain, I am credited\r\nwith being courageous in the hour of danger.\r\n\r\nFor days, sometimes, we could find nothing at a public table that we\r\ncould eat. Then passing through a little settlement we could buy dried\r\nherring, crackers, gum arabic, and slippery elm; the latter, we were\r\ntold, was very nutritious. We frequently sat down to a table with bacon\r\nfloating in grease, coffee without milk, sweetened with sorghum, and\r\nbread or hot biscuit, green with soda, while vegetables and fruit were\r\nseldom seen. Our nights were miserable, owing to the general opinion\r\namong pioneers that a certain species of insect must necessarily\r\nperambulate the beds in a young civilization. One night, after traveling\r\nover prairies all day, eating nothing but what our larder provided, we\r\nsaw a light in a cottage in the distance which seemed to beckon to us.\r\nArriving, we asked the usual question,--if we could get a night's\r\nlodging,--to which the response was inevitably a hearty, hospitable\r\n\"Yes.\" One survey of the premises showed me what to look for in the way\r\nof midnight companionship, so I said to the Governor, \"I will resign in\r\nyour favor the comforts provided for me to-night, and sleep in the\r\ncarriage, as you do so often.\" I persisted against all the earnest\r\npersuasions of our host, and in due time I was ensconced for the night,\r\nand all about the house was silent.\r\n\r\nI had just fallen into a gentle slumber, when a chorus of pronounced\r\ngrunts and a spasmodic shaking of the carriage revealed to me the fact\r\nthat I was surrounded by those long-nosed black pigs, so celebrated for\r\ntheir courage and pertinacity. They had discovered that the iron steps\r\nof the carriage made most satisfactory scratching posts, and each one\r\nwas struggling for his turn. This scratching suggested fleas. Alas!\r\nthought I, before morning I shall be devoured. I was mortally tired and\r\nsleepy, but I reached for the whip and plied it lazily from side to\r\nside; but I soon found nothing but a constant and most vigorous\r\napplication of the whip could hold them at bay one moment. I had heard\r\nthat this type of pig was very combative when thwarted in its desires,\r\nand they seemed in such sore need of relief that I thought there was\r\ndanger of their jumping into the carriage and attacking me. This thought\r\nwas more terrifying than that of the fleas, so I decided to go to sleep\r\nand let them alone to scratch at their pleasure. I had a sad night of\r\nit, and never tried the carriage again, though I had many equally\r\nmiserable experiences within four walls.\r\n\r\nAfter one of these border meetings we stopped another night with a\r\nfamily of two bachelor brothers and two spinster sisters. The home\r\nconsisted of one large room, not yet lathed and plastered. The furniture\r\nincluded a cooking stove, two double beds in remote corners, a table, a\r\nbureau, a washstand, and six wooden chairs. As it was late, there was no\r\nfire in the stove and no suggestion of supper, so the Governor and I ate\r\napples and chewed slippery elm before retiring to dream of comfortable\r\nbeds and well-spread tables in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe brothers resigned their bed to me just as it was. I had noticed that\r\nthere was no ceremonious changing of bed linen under such circumstances,\r\nso I had learned to nip all fastidious notions of individual cleanliness\r\nin the bud, and to accept the inevitable. When the time arrived for\r\nretiring, the Governor and the brothers went out to make astronomical\r\nobservations or smoke, as the case might be, while the sisters and I\r\nmade our evening toilet, and disposed ourselves in the allotted corners.\r\nThat done, the stalwart sons of Adam made their beds with skins and\r\nblankets on the floor. When all was still and darkness reigned, I\r\nreviewed the situation with a heavy heart, seeing that I was bound to\r\nremain a prisoner in the corner all night, come what might. I had just\r\ncongratulated myself on my power of adaptability to circumstances, when\r\nI suddenly started with an emphatic \"What is that?\" A voice from the\r\ncorner asked, \"Is your bed comfortable?\" \"Oh, yes,\" I replied, \"but I\r\nthought I felt a mouse run over my head.\" \"Well,\" said the voice from\r\nthe corner, \"I should not wonder. I have heard such squeaking from that\r\ncorner during the past week that I told sister there must be a mouse\r\nnest in that bed.\" A confession she probably would not have made unless\r\nhalf asleep. This announcement was greeted with suppressed laughter from\r\nthe floor. But it was no laughing matter to me. Alas! what a\r\nprospect--to have mice running over one all night. But there was no\r\nescape. The sisters did not offer to make any explorations, and, in my\r\nfatigue costume, I could not light a candle and make any on my own\r\naccount. The house did not afford an armchair in which I could sit up. I\r\ncould not lie on the floor, and the other bed was occupied. Fortunately,\r\nI was very tired and soon fell asleep. What the mice did the remainder\r\nof the night I never knew, so deep were my slumbers. But, as my features\r\nwere intact, and my facial expression as benign as usual next morning, I\r\ninferred that their gambols had been most innocently and decorously\r\nconducted. These are samples of many similar experiences which we\r\nencountered during the three months of those eventful travels.\r\n\r\nHeretofore my idea had been that pioneer life was a period of romantic\r\nfreedom. When the long, white-covered wagons, bound for the far West,\r\npassed by, I thought of the novelty of a six-months' journey through\r\nthe bright spring and summer days in a house on wheels, meals under\r\nshady trees and beside babbling brooks, sleeping in the open air, and\r\nfinding a home, at last, where land was cheap, the soil rich and deep,\r\nand where the grains, vegetables, fruit, and flowers grew bountifully\r\nwith but little toil. But a few months of pioneer life permanently\r\ndarkened my rosy ideal of the white-covered wagon, the charming picnics\r\nby the way, and the paradise at last. I found many of these adventurers\r\nin unfinished houses and racked with malaria; in one case I saw a family\r\nof eight, all ill with chills and fever. The house was half a mile from\r\nthe spring water on which they depended and from which those best able,\r\nfrom day to day, carried the needed elixir to others suffering with the\r\nusual thirst. Their narrations of all the trials of the long journey\r\nwere indeed heartrending.\r\n\r\nIn one case a family of twelve left their comfortable farm in Illinois,\r\nmuch against the earnest protests of the mother; she having ten\r\nchildren, the youngest a baby then in her arms. All their earthly\r\npossessions were stored in three wagons, and the farm which the mother\r\nowned was sold before they commenced their long and perilous journey.\r\nThere was no reason for going except that the husband had the Western\r\nfever. They were doing well in Illinois, on a large farm within two\r\nmiles of a village, but he had visions of a bonanza near the setting\r\nsun. Accordingly they started. At the end of one month the baby died. A\r\npiece of wood from the cradle was all they had to mark its lonely\r\nresting place. With sad hearts they went on, and, in a few weeks, with\r\ngrief for her child, her old home, her kindred and friends, the mother\r\nalso died. She, too, was left alone on the far-off prairies, and the sad\r\npageant moved on. Another child soon shared the same fate, and then a\r\nspan of horses died, and one wagon, with all the things they could most\r\neasily spare, was abandoned. Arrived at their destination none of the\r\ngolden dreams was realized. The expensive journey, the struggles in\r\nstarting under new circumstances, and the loss of the mother's thrift\r\nand management, made the father so discouraged and reckless that much of\r\nhis property was wasted, and his earthly career was soon ended. Through\r\nthe heroic energy and good management of the eldest daughter, the little\r\npatrimony, in time, was doubled, and the children well brought up and\r\neducated in the rudiments of learning, so that all became respectable\r\nmembers of society. Her advice to all young people is, if you are\r\ncomfortably established in the East, stay there. There is no royal road\r\nto wealth and ease, even in the Western States!\r\n\r\nIn spite of the discomforts we suffered in the Kansas campaign, I was\r\nglad of the experience. It gave me added self-respect to know that I\r\ncould endure such hardships and fatigue with a great degree of\r\ncheerfulness. The Governor and I often laughed heartily, as we patiently\r\nchewed our gum arabic and slippery elm, to think on what a gentle\r\nstimulus we were accomplishing such wonderful feats as orators and\r\ntravelers. It was fortunate our intense enthusiasm for the subject gave\r\nus all the necessary inspiration, as the supplies we gathered by the way\r\nwere by no means sufficiently invigorating for prolonged propagandism.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed these daily drives over the vast prairies, listening to the\r\nGovernor's descriptions of the early days when the \"bushwhackers and\r\njayhawkers\" made their raids on the inhabitants of the young free State.\r\nThe courage and endurance of the women, surrounded by dangers and\r\ndiscomforts, surpassed all description. I count it a great privilege to\r\nhave made the acquaintance of so many noble women and men who had passed\r\nthrough such scenes and conquered such difficulties. They seemed to live\r\nin an atmosphere altogether beyond their surroundings. Many educated\r\nfamilies from New England, disappointed in not finding the much talked\r\nof bonanzas, were living in log cabins, in solitary places, miles from\r\nany neighbors. But I found Emerson, Parker, Holmes, Hawthorne, Whittier,\r\nand Lowell on their bookshelves to gladden their leisure hours.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony and I often comforted ourselves mid adverse winds with\r\nmemories of the short time we spent under Mother Bickerdyke's hospitable\r\nroof at Salina. There we had clean, comfortable beds, delicious viands,\r\nand everything was exquisitely neat. She entertained us with her\r\nreminiscences of the War. With great self-denial she had served her\r\ncountry in camp and hospital, and was with Sherman's army in that\r\nwonderful march to the sea, and here we found her on the outpost of\r\ncivilization, determined to start what Kansas most needed--a good hotel.\r\nBut alas! it was too good for that latitude and proved a financial\r\nfailure. It was, to us, an oasis in the desert, where we would gladly\r\nhave lingered if the opposition would have come to us for conversion.\r\nBut, as we had to carry the gospel of woman's equality into the highways\r\nand hedges, we left dear Mother Bickerdyke with profound regret. The\r\nseed sown in Kansas in 1867 is now bearing its legitimate fruits. There\r\nwas not a county in the State where meetings were not held or tracts\r\nscattered with a generous hand. If the friends of our cause in the East\r\nhad been true and had done for woman what they did for the colored man,\r\nI believe both propositions would have been carried; but with a narrow\r\npolicy, playing off one against the other, both were defeated. A policy\r\nof injustice always bears its own legitimate fruit in failure.\r\n\r\nHowever, women learned one important lesson--namely, that it is\r\nimpossible for the best of men to understand women's feelings or the\r\nhumiliation of their position. When they asked us to be silent on our\r\nquestion during the War, and labor for the emancipation of the slave, we\r\ndid so, and gave five years to his emancipation and enfranchisement. To\r\nthis proposition my friend, Susan B. Anthony, never consented, but was\r\ncompelled to yield because no one stood with her. I was convinced, at\r\nthe time, that it was the true policy. I am now equally sure that it was\r\na blunder, and, ever since, I have taken my beloved Susan's judgment\r\nagainst the world. I have always found that, when we see eye to eye, we\r\nare sure to be right, and when we pull together we are strong. After we\r\ndiscuss any point together and fully agree, our faith in our united\r\njudgment is immovable and no amount of ridicule and opposition has the\r\nslightest influence, come from what quarter it may.\r\n\r\nTogether we withstood the Republicans and abolitionists, when, a second\r\ntime, they made us the most solemn promises of earnest labor for our\r\nenfranchisement, when the slaves were safe beyond a peradventure. They\r\nnever redeemed their promise made during the War, hence, when they\r\nurged us to silence in the Kansas campaign, we would not for a moment\r\nentertain the proposition. The women generally awoke to their duty to\r\nthemselves. They had been deceived once and could not be again. If the\r\nleaders in the Republican and abolition camps could deceive us, whom\r\ncould we trust?\r\n\r\nAgain we were urged to be silent on our rights, when the proposition to\r\ntake the word \"white\" out of the New York Constitution was submitted to\r\na vote of the people of the State, or, rather, to one-half the people,\r\nas women had no voice in the matter. Again we said \"No, no, gentlemen!\r\nif the 'white' comes out of the Constitution, let the 'male' come out\r\nalso. Women have stood with the negro, thus far, on equal ground as\r\nostracized classes, outside the political paradise; and now, when the\r\ndoor is open, it is but fair that we both should enter and enjoy all the\r\nfruits of citizenship. Heretofore ranked with idiots, lunatics, and\r\ncriminals in the Constitution, the negro has been the only respectable\r\ncompeer we had; so pray do not separate us now for another twenty years,\r\nere the constitutional door will again be opened.\"\r\n\r\nWe were persistently urged to give all our efforts to get the word\r\n\"white\" out, and thus secure the enfranchisement of the colored man, as\r\nthat, they said, would prepare the way for us to follow. Several editors\r\nthreatened that, unless we did so, their papers should henceforth do\r\ntheir best to defeat every measure we proposed. But we were deaf alike\r\nto persuasions and threats, thinking it wiser to labor for women,\r\nconstituting, as they did, half the people of the State, rather than for\r\na small number of colored men; who, viewing all things from the same\r\nstandpoint as white men, would be an added power against us.\r\n\r\nThe question settled in Kansas, we returned, with George Francis Train,\r\nto New York. He offered to pay all the expenses of the journey and\r\nmeetings in all the chief cities on the way, and see that we were fully\r\nand well reported in their respective journals. After prolonged\r\nconsultation Miss Anthony and I thought best to accept the offer and we\r\ndid so. Most of our friends thought it a grave blunder, but the result\r\nproved otherwise. Mr. Train was then in his prime--a large, fine-looking\r\nman, a gentleman in dress and manner, neither smoking, chewing,\r\ndrinking, nor gormandizing. He was an effective speaker and actor, as\r\none of his speeches, which he illustrated, imitating the poor wife at\r\nthe washtub and the drunken husband reeling in, fully showed. He gave\r\nhis audience charcoal sketches of everyday life rather than argument. He\r\nalways pleased popular audiences, and even the most fastidious were\r\namused with his caricatures. As the newspapers gave several columns to\r\nour meetings at every point through all the States, the agitation was\r\nwidespread and of great value. To be sure our friends, on all sides,\r\nfell off, and those especially who wished us to be silent on the\r\nquestion of woman's rights, declared \"the cause too sacred to be\r\nadvocated by such a charlatan as George Francis Train.\" We thought\r\notherwise, as the accession of Mr. Train increased the agitation\r\ntwofold. If these fastidious ladies and gentlemen had come out to Kansas\r\nand occupied the ground and provided \"the sinews of war,\" there would\r\nhave been no field for Mr. Train's labors, and we should have accepted\r\ntheir services. But, as the ground was unoccupied, he had, at least,\r\nthe right of a reform \"squatter\" to cultivate the cardinal virtues and\r\nreap a moral harvest wherever he could.\r\n\r\nReaching New York, Mr. Train made it possible for us to establish a\r\nnewspaper, which gave another impetus to our movement. The _Revolution_,\r\npublished by Susan B. Anthony and edited by Parker Pillsbury and myself,\r\nlived two years and a half and was then consolidated with the New York\r\n_Christian Enquirer_, edited by the Rev. Henry Bellows, D.D. I regard\r\nthe brief period in which I edited the _Revolution_ as one of the\r\nhappiest of my life, and I may add the most useful. In looking over the\r\neditorials I find but one that I sincerely regret, and that was a retort\r\non Mr. Garrison, written under great provocation, but not by me, which\r\ncircumstances, at the time, forbade me to disown. Considering the\r\npressure brought to bear on Miss Anthony and myself, I feel now that our\r\npatience and forbearance with our enemies in their malignant attacks on\r\nour good, name, which we never answered, were indeed marvelous.\r\n\r\nWe said at all times and on all other subjects just what we thought, and\r\nadvertised nothing that we did not believe in. No advertisements of\r\nquack remedies appeared in our columns. One of our clerks once published\r\na bread powder advertisement, which I did not see until the paper\r\nappeared; so, in the next number, I said, editorially, what I thought of\r\nit. I was alone in the office, one day, when a man blustered in. \"Who,\"\r\nsaid he, \"runs this concern?\" \"You will find the names of the editors\r\nand publishers,\" I replied, \"on the editorial page.\" \"Are you one of\r\nthem?\" \"I am,\" I replied. \"Well, do you know that I agreed to pay\r\ntwenty dollars to have that bread powder advertised for one month, and\r\nthen you condemn it editorially?\" \"I have nothing to do with the\r\nadvertising; Miss Anthony pays me to say what I think.\" \"Have you any\r\nmore thoughts to publish on that bread powder?\" \"Oh, yes,\" I replied, \"I\r\nhave not exhausted the subject yet.\" \"Then,\" said he, \"I will have the\r\nadvertisement taken out. What is there to pay for the one insertion?\"\r\n\"Oh, nothing,\" I replied, \"as the editorial probably did you more injury\r\nthan the advertisement did you good.\" On leaving, with prophetic vision,\r\nhe said, \"I prophesy a short life for this paper; the business world is\r\nbased on quackery, and you cannot live without it.\" With melancholy\r\ncertainty, I replied, \"I fear you are right.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nLYCEUMS AND LECTURERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lyceum Bureau was, at one time, a great feature in American life.\r\nThe three leading bureaus were in Boston, New York, and Chicago. The\r\nmanagers, map in hand, would lay out trips, more or less extensive\r\naccording to the capacity or will of the speakers, and then, with a\r\ndozen or more victims in hand, make arrangements with the committees in\r\nvarious towns and cities to set them all in motion. As the managers of\r\nthe bureaus had ten per cent. of what the speakers made, it was to their\r\ninterest to keep the time well filled. Hence the engagements were made\r\nwithout the slightest reference to the comfort of the travelers. With\r\nour immense distances, it was often necessary to travel night and day,\r\nsometimes changing cars at midnight, and perhaps arriving at the\r\ndestination half an hour or less before going on the platform, and\r\nstarting again on the journey immediately upon leaving it. The route was\r\nalways carefully written out, giving the time the trains started from\r\nand arrived at various points; but as cross trains often failed to\r\nconnect, one traveled, guidebook in hand, in a constant fever of\r\nanxiety. As, in the early days, the fees were from one to two hundred\r\ndollars a night, the speakers themselves were desirous of accomplishing\r\nas much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 I gave my name, for the first time, to the New York Bureau, and\r\non November 14 began the long, weary pilgrimages, from Maine to Texas,\r\nthat lasted twelve years; speaking steadily for eight months--from\r\nOctober to June--every season. That was the heyday of the lecturing\r\nperiod, when a long list of bright men and women were constantly on the\r\nwing. Anna Dickinson, Olive Logan, Kate Field,--later, Mrs. Livermore\r\nand Mrs. Howe, Alcott, Phillips, Douglass, Tilton, Curtis, Beecher, and,\r\nseveral years later, General Kilpatrick, with Henry Vincent, Bradlaugh,\r\nand Matthew Arnold from England; these and many others were stars of the\r\nlecture platform.\r\n\r\nSome of us occasionally managed to spend Sunday together, at a good\r\nhotel in some city, to rest and feast and talk over our joys and\r\nsorrows, the long journeys, the hard fare in the country hotels, the\r\nrainy nights when committees felt blue and tried to cut down our fees;\r\nthe being compelled by inconsiderate people to talk on the train; the\r\noverheated, badly ventilated cars; the halls, sometimes too warm,\r\nsometimes too cold; babies crying in our audiences; the rain pattering\r\non the roof overhead or leaking on the platform--these were common\r\nexperiences. In the West, women with babies uniformly occupied the front\r\nseats so that the little ones, not understanding what you said, might be\r\namused with your gestures and changing facial expression. All these\r\nthings, so trying, at the time, to concentrated and enthusiastic\r\nspeaking, afterward served as subjects of amusing conversation. We\r\nunanimously complained of the tea and coffee. Mrs. Livermore had the\r\nwisdom to carry a spirit lamp with her own tea and coffee, and thus\r\nsupplied herself with the needed stimulants for her oratorical\r\nefforts. The hardships of these lyceum trips can never be appreciated\r\nexcept by those who have endured them. With accidents to cars and\r\nbridges, with floods and snow blockades, the pitfalls in one of these\r\ncampaigns were without number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELIZABETH SMITH MILLER.] [Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, when engaged to speak at Maquoketa, Iowa, I arrived at\r\nLyons about noon, to find the road was blocked with snow, and no chance\r\nof the cars running for days. \"Well,\" said I to the landlord, \"I must be\r\nat Maquoketa at eight o'clock to-night; have you a sleigh, a span of\r\nfleet horses, and a skillful driver? If so, I will go across the\r\ncountry.\" \"Oh, yes, madam!\" he replied, \"I have all you ask; but you\r\ncould not stand a six-hours' drive in this piercing wind.\" Having lived\r\nin a region of snow, with the thermometer down to twenty degrees below\r\nzero, I had no fears of winds and drifts, so I said, \"Get the sleigh\r\nready and I will try it.\" Accordingly I telegraphed the committee that I\r\nwould be there, and started. I was well bundled up in a fur cloak and\r\nhood, a hot oak plank at my feet, and a thick veil over my head and\r\nface. As the landlord gave the finishing touch, by throwing a large\r\nbuffalo robe over all and tying the two tails together at the back of my\r\nhead and thus effectually preventing me putting my hand to my nose, he\r\nsaid, \"There, if you can only sit perfectly still, you will come out all\r\nright at Maquoketa; that is, if you get there, which I very much doubt.\"\r\nIt was a long, hard drive against the wind and through drifts, but I\r\nscarcely moved a finger, and, as the clock struck eight, we drove into\r\nthe town. The hall was warm, and the church bell having announced my\r\narrival, a large audience was assembled. As I learned that all the roads\r\nin Northern Iowa were blocked, I made the entire circuit, from point to\r\npoint, in a sleigh, traveling forty and fifty miles a day.\r\n\r\nAt the Sherman House, in Chicago, three weeks later, I met Mr. Bradlaugh\r\nand General Kilpatrick, who were advertised on the same route ahead of\r\nme. \"Well,\" said I, \"where have you gentlemen been?\" \"Waiting here for\r\nthe roads to be opened. We have lost three weeks' engagements,\" they\r\nreplied. As the General was lecturing on his experiences in Sherman's\r\nmarch to the sea, I chaffed him on not being able, in an emergency, to\r\nmarch across the State of Iowa. They were much astonished and somewhat\r\nashamed, when I told them of my long, solitary drives over the prairies\r\nfrom day to day. It was the testimony of all the bureaus that the women\r\ncould endure more fatigue and were more conscientious than the men in\r\nfilling their appointments.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant feature of these trips was the great educational work\r\naccomplished for the people through their listening to lectures on all\r\nthe vital questions of the hour. Wherever any of us chanced to be on\r\nSunday, we preached in some church; and wherever I had a spare\r\nafternoon, I talked to women alone, on marriage, maternity, and the laws\r\nof life and health. We made many most charming acquaintances, too,\r\nscattered all over our Western World, and saw how comfortable and happy\r\nsensible people could be, living in most straitened circumstances, with\r\nnone of the luxuries of life. If most housekeepers could get rid of\r\none-half their clothes and furniture and put their bric-a-brac in the\r\ntown museum, life would be simplified and they would begin to know what\r\nleisure means. When I see so many of our American women struggling to be\r\nartists, who cannot make a good loaf of bread nor a palatable cup of\r\ncoffee, I think of what Theodore Parker said when art was a craze in\r\nBoston. \"The fine arts do not interest me so much as the coarse arts\r\nwhich feed, clothe, house, and comfort a people. I would rather be a\r\ngreat man like Franklin than a Michael Angelo--nay, if I had a son, I\r\nshould rather see him a mechanic, like the late George Stephenson, in\r\nEngland, than a great painter like Rubens, who only copied beauty.\"\r\n\r\nOne day I found at the office of the _Revolution_ an invitation to meet\r\nMrs. Moulton in the Academy of Music, where she was to try her voice for\r\nthe coming concert for the benefit of the Woman's Medical College. And\r\nwhat a voice for power, pathos, pliability! I never heard the like.\r\nSeated beside her mother, Mrs. W.H. Greenough, I enjoyed alike the\r\nmother's anxious pride and the daughter's triumph. I felt, as I\r\nlistened, the truth of what Vieuxtemps said the first time he heard her,\r\n\"That is the traditional voice for which the ages have waited and\r\nlonged.\" When, on one occasion, Mrs. Moulton sang a song of Mozart's to\r\nAuber's accompaniment, someone present asked, \"What could be added to\r\nmake this more complete?\" Auber looked up to heaven, and, with a sweet\r\nsmile, said, \"Nothing but that Mozart should have been here to listen.\"\r\nLooking and listening, \"Here,\" thought I, \"is another jewel in the crown\r\nof womanhood, to radiate and glorify the lives of all.\" I have such an\r\nintense pride of sex that the triumphs of woman in art, literature,\r\noratory, science, or song rouse my enthusiasm as nothing else can.\r\n\r\nHungering, that day, for gifted women, I called on Alice and Phebe Cary\r\nand Mary Clemmer Ames, and together we gave the proud white male such a\r\nserving up as did our souls good and could not hurt him, intrenched, as\r\nhe is, behind creeds, codes, customs, and constitutions, with vizor and\r\nbreastplate of self-complacency and conceit. In criticising Jessie\r\nBoucherett's essay on \"Superfluous Women,\" in which she advises men in\r\nEngland to emigrate in order to leave room and occupation for women, the\r\n_Tribune_ said: \"The idea of a home without a man in it!\" In visiting\r\nthe Carys one always felt that there was a home--a very charming one,\r\ntoo--without a man in it.\r\n\r\nOnce when Harriet Beecher Stowe was at Dr. Taylor's, I had the\r\nopportunity to make her acquaintance. In her sanctum, surrounded by\r\nbooks and papers, she was just finishing her second paper on the Byron\r\nfamily, and her sister Catherine was preparing papers on her educational\r\nwork, preparatory to a coming meeting of the ladies of the school board.\r\nThe women of the Beecher family, though most of them wives and mothers,\r\nall had a definite life-work outside the family circle, and other\r\nobjects of intense interest beside husbands, babies, cook stoves, and\r\nsocial conversations. Catherine said she was opposed to woman suffrage,\r\nand if she thought there was the least danger of our getting it, she\r\nwould write and talk against it vehemently. But, as the nation was safe\r\nagainst such a calamity, she was willing to let the talk go on, because\r\nthe agitation helped her work. \"It is rather paradoxical,\" I said to\r\nher, \"that the pressing of a false principle can help a true one; but\r\nwhen you get the women all thoroughly educated, they will step off to\r\nthe polls and vote in spite of you.\"\r\n\r\nOne night on the train from New York to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, I\r\nfound abundant time to think over the personal peculiarities of the many\r\nnoble women who adorn this nineteenth century, and, as I recalled them,\r\none by one, in America, England, France, and Germany, and all that they\r\nare doing and saying, I wandered that any man could be so blind as not\r\nto see that woman has already taken her place as the peer of man. While\r\nthe lords of creation have been debating her sphere and drawing their\r\nchalk marks here and there, woman has quietly stepped outside the barren\r\nfields where she was compelled to graze for centuries, and is now in\r\ngreen pastures and beside still waters, a power in the world of thought.\r\n\r\nThese pleasant cogitations were cut short by my learning that I had\r\ntaken the wrong train, and must change at Harrisburg at two o'clock in\r\nthe morning. How soon the reflection that I must leave my comfortable\r\nberth at such an unchristian hour changed the whole hue of glorious\r\nwomanhood and every other earthly blessing! However, I lived through the\r\ntrial and arrived at Williamsport as the day dawned. I had a good\r\naudience at the opera house that evening, and was introduced to many\r\nagreeable people, who declared themselves converted to woman suffrage by\r\nmy ministrations. Among the many new jewels in my crown, I added, that\r\nnight, Judge Bently.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1869, I passed one night in Philadelphia, with Miss\r\nAnthony, at Anna Dickinson's home--a neat, three-story brick house in\r\nLocust Street. This haven of rest, where the world-famous little woman\r\ncame, ever and anon, to recruit her overtaxed energies, was very\r\ntastefully furnished, adorned with engravings, books, and statuary. Her\r\nmother, sister, and brother made up the household--a pleasing,\r\ncultivated trio. The brother was a handsome youth of good judgment, and\r\ngiven to sage remarks; the sister, witty, intuitive, and incisive in\r\nspeech; the mother, dressed in rich Quaker costume, and though nearly\r\nseventy, still possessed of great personal beauty. She was intelligent,\r\ndignified, refined, and, in manner and appearance, reminded one of\r\nAngelina Grimké as she looked in her younger days. Everything about the\r\nhouse and its appointments indicated that it was the abode of genius and\r\ncultivation, and, although Anna was absent, the hospitalities were\r\ngracefully dispensed by her family. Napoleon and Shakespeare seemed to\r\nbe Anna's patron saints, looking down, on all sides, from the wall. The\r\nmother amused us with the sore trials her little orator had inflicted on\r\nthe members of the household by her vagaries in the world of fame.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Kennett Square, a young gentleman pointed out to us the\r\nhome of Benjamin West, who distinguished himself, to the disgust of\r\nbroadbrims generally, as a landscape painter. In commencing his career,\r\nit is said he made use of the tail of a cat in lieu of a brush. Of\r\ncourse Benjamin's first attempts were on the sly, and he could not ask\r\npaterfamilias for money to buy a brush without encountering the good\r\nman's scorn. Whether, in the hour of his need and fresh enthusiasm, poor\r\npuss was led to the sacrificial altar, or whether he found her reposing\r\nby the roadside, having paid the debt of Nature, our informant could not\r\nsay; enough that, in time, he owned a brush and immortalized himself by\r\nhis skill in its use. Such erratic ones as Whittier, West, and Anna\r\nDickinson go to prove that even the prim, proper, perfect Quakers are\r\nsubject to like infirmities with the rest of the human family.\r\n\r\nI had long heard of the \"Progressive Friends\" in the region round\r\nLongwood; had read the many bulls they issued from their \"yearly\r\nmeetings\" on every question, on war, capital punishment, temperance,\r\nslavery, woman's rights; had learned that they were turning the cold\r\nshoulder on the dress, habits, and opinions of their Fathers; listening\r\nto the ministrations of such worldlings as William Lloyd Garrison,\r\nTheodore Tilton, and Oliver Johnson, in a new meeting house, all painted\r\nand varnished, with cushions, easy seats, carpets, stoves, a musical\r\ninstrument--shade of George Fox, forgive--and three brackets with vases\r\non the \"high seat,\" and, more than all that, men and women were\r\nindiscriminately seated throughout the house.\r\n\r\nAll this Miss Anthony and I beheld with our own eyes, and, in company\r\nwith Sarah Pugh and Chandler Darlington, did sit together in the high\r\nseat and talk in the congregation of the people. There, too, we met\r\nHannah Darlington and Dinah Mendenhall,--names long known in every good\r\nwork,--and, for the space of one day, did enjoy the blissful serenity of\r\nthat earthly paradise. The women of Kennett Square were celebrated not\r\nonly for their model housekeeping but also for their rare cultivation on\r\nall subjects of general interest.\r\n\r\nIn November I again started on one of my Western trips, but, alas! on\r\nthe very day the trains were changed, and so I could not make\r\nconnections to meet my engagements at Saginaw and Marshall, and just\r\nsaved myself at Toledo by going directly from the cars before the\r\naudience, with the dust of twenty-four hours' travel on my garments.\r\nNot being able to reach Saginaw, I went straight to Ann Arbor, and spent\r\nthree days most pleasantly in visiting old friends, making new ones, and\r\nsurveying the town, with its grand University. I was invited to\r\nThanksgiving dinner at the home of Mr. Seaman, a highly cultivated\r\nDemocratic editor, author of \"Progress of Nations.\" A choice number of\r\nguests gathered round his hospitable board on that occasion, over which\r\nhis wife presided with dignity and grace. Woman suffrage was the target\r\nfor the combined wit and satire of the company, and, after four hours of\r\nuninterrupted sharpshooting, pyrotechnics, and laughter, we dispersed to\r\nour several abodes, fairly exhausted with the excess of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nOne gentleman had the moral hardihood to assert that men had more\r\nendurance than women, whereupon a lady remarked that she would like to\r\nsee the thirteen hundred young men in the University laced up in\r\nsteel-ribbed corsets, with hoops, heavy skirts, trains, high heels,\r\npanniers, chignons, and dozens of hairpins sticking in their scalps,\r\ncooped up in the house year after year, with no exhilarating exercise,\r\nno hopes, aims, nor ambitions in life, and know if they could stand it\r\nas well as the girls. \"Nothing,\" said she, \"but the fact that women,\r\nlike cats, have nine lives, enables them to survive the present _régime_\r\nto which custom dooms the sex.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in Ann Arbor I gave my lecture on \"Our Girls\" in the new Methodist\r\nchurch--a large building, well lighted, and filled with a brilliant\r\naudience. The students, in large numbers, were there, and strengthened\r\nthe threads of my discourse with frequent and generous applause;\r\nespecially when I urged on the Regents of the University the duty of\r\nopening its doors to the daughters of the State. There were several\r\nsplendid girls in Michigan, at that time, preparing themselves for\r\nadmission to the law department. As Judge Cooley, one of the professors,\r\nwas a very liberal man, as well as a sound lawyer, and strongly in favor\r\nof opening the college to girls, I had no doubt the women of Michigan\r\nwould soon distinguish themselves at the bar. Some said the chief\r\ndifficulty in the way of the girls of that day being admitted to the\r\nUniversity was the want of room. That could have been easily obviated by\r\ntelling the young men from abroad to betake themselves to the colleges\r\nin their respective States, that Michigan might educate her daughters.\r\nAs the women owned a good share of the property of the State, and had\r\nbeen heavily taxed to build and endow that institution, it was but fair\r\nthat they should share in its advantages.\r\n\r\nThe Michigan University, with its extensive grounds, commodious\r\nbuildings, medical and law schools, professors' residences, and the\r\nfinest laboratory in the country, was an institution of which the State\r\nwas justly proud, and, as the tuition was free, it was worth the trouble\r\nof a long, hard siege by the girls of Michigan to gain admittance there.\r\nI advised them to organize their forces at once, get their minute guns,\r\nbattering rams, monitors, projectiles, bombshells, cannon, torpedoes,\r\nand crackers ready, and keep up a brisk cannonading until the grave and\r\nreverend seigniors opened the door, and shouted, \"Hold, enough!\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies of Ann Arbor had a fine library of their own, where their\r\nclubs met once a week. They had just formed a suffrage association. My\r\nvisit ended with a pleasant reception, at which I was introduced to the\r\nchaplain, several professors, and many ladies and gentlemen ready to\r\naccept the situation. Judge Cooley gave me a glowing account of the laws\r\nof Michigan--how easy it was for wives to get possession of all the\r\nproperty, and then sunder the marriage tie and leave the poor husband to\r\nthe charity of the cold world, with their helpless children about him. I\r\nheard of a rich lady, there, who made a will, giving her husband a\r\nhandsome annuity as long as he remained her widower. It was evident that\r\nthe poor \"white male,\" sooner or later, was doomed to try for himself\r\nthe virtue of the laws he had made for women. I hope, for the sake of\r\nthe race, he will not bear oppression with the stupid fortitude we have\r\nfor six thousand years.\r\n\r\nAt Flint I was entertained by Mr. and Mrs. Jenny. Mr. Jenny was a\r\nDemocratic editor who believed in progress, and in making smooth paths\r\nfor women in this great wilderness of life. His wife was a remarkable\r\nwoman. She inaugurated the Ladies' Libraries in Michigan. In Flint they\r\nhad a fine brick building and nearly two thousand volumes of choice\r\nbooks, owned by the association, and money always in the treasury. Here,\r\ntoo, I had a fine audience and gave my lecture entitled \"Open the Door.\"\r\n\r\nAt Coldwater, in spite of its name, I found a warm, appreciative\r\naudience. The president of the lyceum was a sensible young man who,\r\nafter graduating at Ann Arbor, decided, instead of starving at the law,\r\nto work with his hands and brains at the same time. When all men go to\r\ntheir legitimate business of creating wealth, developing the resources\r\nof the country, and leave its mere exchange to the weaker sex, we shall\r\nnot have so many superfluous women in the world with nothing to do. It\r\nis evident the time has come to hunt man into his appropriate sphere.\r\nComing from Chicago, I met Governor Fairchild and Senator Williams of\r\nWisconsin. It was delightful to find them thoroughly grounded in the\r\nfaith of woman suffrage. They had been devout readers of the\r\n_Revolution_ ever since Miss Anthony induced them to subscribe, the\r\nwinter before, at Madison. Of course a new glow of intelligence\r\nirradiated their fine faces (for they were remarkably handsome men) and\r\nthere was a new point to all their words. Senator Williams, like myself,\r\nwas on a lecturing tour. \"Man\" was his theme, for which I was devoutly\r\nthankful; for, if there are any of God's creatures that need lecturing,\r\nit is this one that is forever advising us. I thought of all men, from\r\nFather Gregory down to Horace Bushnell, who had wearied their brains to\r\ndescribe woman's sphere, and how signally they had failed.\r\n\r\nThroughout my lyceum journeys I was of great use to the traveling\r\npublic, in keeping the ventilators in the cars open, and the dampers in\r\nfiery stoves shut up, especially in sleeping cars at night. How many\r\ntimes a day I thought what the sainted Horace Mann tried to impress on\r\nhis stupid countrymen, that, inasmuch as the air is forty miles deep\r\naround the globe, it is a useless piece of economy to breathe any number\r\nof cubic feet over more than seven times! The babies, too, need to be\r\nthankful that I was in a position to witness their wrongs. Many, through\r\nmy intercessions, received their first drink of water, and were\r\nemancipated from woolen hoods, veils, tight strings under their chins,\r\nand endless swaddling bands. It is a startling assertion, but true,\r\nthat I have met few women who know how to take care of a baby. And this\r\nfact led me, on one trip, to lecture to my fair countrywomen on\r\n\"Marriage and Maternity,\" hoping to aid in the inauguration of a new era\r\nof happy, healthy babies.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty-four hours in the express I found myself in a pleasant room\r\nin the International Hotel at La Crosse, looking out on the Great Mother\r\nof Waters, on whose cold bosom the ice and the steamers were struggling\r\nfor mastery. Beyond stretched the snow-clad bluffs, sternly looking down\r\non the Mississippi, as if to say, \"'Thus far shalt thou come and no\r\nfarther'--though sluggish, you are aggressive, ever pushing where you\r\nshould not; but all attempts in this direction are alike vain; since\r\ncreation's dawn, we have defied you, and here we stand, to-day, calm,\r\nmajestic, immovable. Coquette as you will in other latitudes, with\r\nflowery banks and youthful piers in the busy marts of trade, and\r\nundermine them, one and all, with your deceitful wooings, but bow in\r\nreverence as you gaze on us. We have no eyes for your beauty; no ears\r\nfor your endless song; our heads are in the clouds, our hearts commune\r\nwith gods; you have no part in the eternal problems of the ages that\r\nfill our thoughts, yours the humble duty to wash our feet, and then pass\r\non, remembering to keep in your appropriate sphere, within the barks\r\nthat wise geographers have seen fit to mark.\"\r\n\r\nAs I listened to these complacent hills and watched the poor Mississippi\r\nweeping as she swept along, to lose her sorrows in ocean's depths, I\r\nthought how like the attitude of man to woman. Let these proud hills\r\nremember that they, too, slumbered for centuries in deep valleys down,\r\ndown, when, perchance, the sparkling Mississippi rolled above their\r\nheads, and but for some generous outburst, some upheaval of old Mother\r\nEarth, wishing that her rock-ribbed sons, as well as graceful daughters,\r\nmight enjoy the light, the sunshine and the shower--but for this soul of\r\nlove in matter as well as mind--these bluffs and the sons of Adam, too,\r\nmight not boast the altitude they glory in to-day. Those who have ears\r\nto hear discern low, rumbling noises that foretell convulsions in our\r\nsocial world that may, perchance, in the next upheaval, bring woman to\r\nthe surface; up, up, from gloomy ocean depths, dark caverns, and damper\r\nvalleys. The struggling daughters of earth are soon to walk in the\r\nsunlight of a higher civilization.\r\n\r\nEscorted by Mr. Woodward, a member of the bar, I devoted a day to the\r\nlions of La Crosse. First we explored the courthouse, a large, new brick\r\nbuilding, from whose dome we had a grand view of the surrounding\r\ncountry. The courtroom where justice is administered was large, clean,\r\nairy--the bench carpeted and adorned with a large, green, stuffed chair,\r\nin which I sat down, and, in imagination, summoned up advocates, jurors,\r\nprisoners, and people, and wondered how I should feel pronouncing\r\nsentence of death on a fellow-being, or, like Portia, wisely checkmating\r\nthe Shylocks of our times. Here I met Judge Hugh Cameron, formerly of\r\nJohnstown. He invited us into his sanctum, where we had a pleasant chat\r\nabout our native hills, Scotch affiliations, the bench and bar of New\r\nYork, and the Wisconsin laws for women. The Judge, having maintained a\r\nhappy bachelor state, looked placidly on the aggressive movements of\r\nthe sex, as his domestic felicity would be no way affected, whether\r\nwoman was voted up or down.\r\n\r\nWe next surveyed the Pomeroy building, which contained a large,\r\ntastefully finished hall and printing establishment, where the La Crosse\r\n_Democrat_ was formerly published. As I saw the perfection, order, and\r\ngood taste, in all arrangements throughout, and listened to Mr. Huron's\r\ndescription of the life and leading characteristics of its chief, it\r\nseemed impossible to reconcile the tone of the _Democrat_ with the moral\r\nstatus of its editor. I never saw a more complete business\r\nestablishment, and the editorial sanctum looked as if it might be the\r\nabiding place of the Muses. Mirrors, pictures, statuary, books, music,\r\nrare curiosities, and fine specimens of birds and minerals were\r\neverywhere. Over the editor's table was a beautiful painting of his\r\nyouthful daughter, whose flaxen hair, blue eyes, and angelic face should\r\nhave inspired a father to nobler, purer, utterances than he was wont, at\r\nthat time, to give to the world.\r\n\r\nBut Pomeroy's good deeds will live long after his profane words are\r\nforgotten. Throughout the establishment cards, set up in conspicuous\r\nplaces, said, \"Smoking here is positively forbidden.\" Drinking, too, was\r\nforbidden to all his employés. The moment a man was discovered using\r\nintoxicating drinks, he was dismissed. In the upper story of the\r\nbuilding was a large, pleasant room, handsomely carpeted and furnished,\r\nwhere the employés, in their leisure hours, could talk, write, read, or\r\namuse themselves in any rational way.\r\n\r\nMr. Pomeroy was humane and generous with his employés, honorable in his\r\nbusiness relations, and boundless in his charities to the poor. His\r\ncharity, business honor, and public spirit were highly spoken of by\r\nthose who knew him best. That a journal does not always reflect the\r\neditor is as much the fault of society as of the man. So long as the\r\npublic will pay for gross personalities, obscenity, and slang, decent\r\njournals will be outbidden in the market. The fact that the La Crosse\r\n_Democrat_ found a ready sale in all parts of the country showed that\r\nMr. Pomeroy fairly reflected the popular taste. While multitudes turned\r\nup the whites of their eyes and denounced him in public, they bought his\r\npaper and read it in private.\r\n\r\nI left La Crosse in a steamer, just as the rising sun lighted the\r\nhilltops and gilded the Mississippi. It was a lovely morning, and, in\r\ncompany with a young girl of sixteen, who had traveled alone from some\r\nremote part of Canada, bound for a northern village in Wisconsin, I\r\npromenaded the deck most of the way to Winona, a pleased listener to the\r\nincidents of my young companion's experiences. She said that, when\r\ncrossing Lake Huron, she was the only woman on board, but the men were\r\nso kind and civil that she soon forgot she was alone. I found many\r\ngirls, traveling long distances, who had never been five miles from home\r\nbefore, with a self-reliance that was remarkable. They all spoke in the\r\nmost flattering manner of the civility of our American men in looking\r\nafter their baggage and advising them as to the best routes.\r\n\r\nAs you approach St. Paul, at Fort Snelling, where the Mississippi and\r\nMinnesota join forces, the country grows bold and beautiful. The town\r\nitself, then boasting about thirty thousand inhabitants, is finely\r\nsituated, with substantial stone residences. It was in one of these\r\ncharming homes I found a harbor of rest during my stay in the city. Mrs.\r\nStuart, whose hospitalities I enjoyed, was a woman of rare common sense\r\nand sound health. Her husband, Dr. Jacob H. Stuart, was one of the very\r\nfirst surgeons to volunteer in the late war. In the panic at Bull Run,\r\ninstead of running, as everybody else did, he stayed with the wounded,\r\nand was taken prisoner while taking a bullet from the head of a rebel.\r\nWhen exchanged, Beauregard gave him his sword for his devotion to the\r\ndying and wounded.\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of seeing several of the leading gentlemen and ladies\r\nof St. Paul at the Orphans' Fair, where we all adjourned, after my\r\nlecture, to discuss woman's rights, over a bounteous supper. Here I met\r\nWilliam L. Banning, the originator of the Lake Superior and Mississippi\r\nRailroad. He besieged Congress and capitalists for a dozen years to\r\nbuild this road, but was laughed at and put off with sneers and\r\ncontempt, until, at last, Jay Cooke became so weary of his continual\r\ncoming that he said: \"I will build the road to get rid of you.\"\r\n\r\nWhittier seems to have had a prophetic vision of the peopling of this\r\nregion. When speaking of the Yankee, he says:\r\n\r\n    \"He's whittling by St. Mary's Falls,\r\n     Upon his loaded wain;\r\n    He's measuring o'er the Pictured Rocks,\r\n     With eager eyes of gain.\r\n\r\n    \"I hear the mattock in the mine,\r\n     The ax-stroke in the dell,\r\n    The clamor from the Indian lodge,\r\n     The Jesuits' chapel bell!\r\n\r\n    \"I hear the tread of pioneers\r\n     Of nations yet to be;\r\n    The first low wash of waves, where soon\r\n     Shall roll a human sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe opening of these new outlets and mines of wealth was wholly due to\r\nthe forecast and perseverance of Mr. Banning. The first engine that went\r\nover a part of the road had been christened at St. Paul, with becoming\r\nceremonies; the officiating priestess being a beautiful maiden. A cask\r\nof water from the Pacific was sent by Mr. Banning's brother from\r\nCalifornia, and a small keg was brought from Lake Superior for the\r\noccasion. A glass was placed in the hands of Miss Ella B. Banning,\r\ndaughter of the president, who then christened the engine, saying: \"With\r\nthe waters of the Pacific Ocean in my right hand, and the waters of Lake\r\nSuperior in my left, invoking the Genius of Progress to bring together,\r\nwith iron band, two great commercial systems of the globe, I dedicate\r\nthis engine to the use of the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad,\r\nand name it William L. Banning.\"\r\n\r\nFrom St. Paul to Dubuque, as the boats had ceased running, a circuitous\r\nroute and a night of discomfort were inevitable. Leaving the main road\r\nto Chicago at Clinton Junction, I had the pleasure of waiting at a small\r\ncountry inn until midnight for a freight train. This was indeed dreary,\r\nbut, having Mrs. Child's sketches of Mmes. De Staël and Roland at hand,\r\nI read of Napoleon's persecutions of the one and Robespierre's of the\r\nother, until, by comparison, my condition was tolerable, and the little\r\nmeagerly furnished room, with its dull fire and dim lamp, seemed a\r\nparadise compared with years of exile from one's native land or the\r\nprison cell and guillotine. How small our ordinary, petty trials seem\r\nin contrast with the mountains of sorrow that have been piled up on the\r\ngreat souls of the past! Absorbed in communion with them twelve o'clock\r\nsoon came, and with it the train.\r\n\r\nA burly son of Adam escorted me to the passenger car filled with German\r\nimmigrants, with tin cups, babies, bags, and bundles innumerable. The\r\nventilators were all closed, the stoves hot, and the air was like that\r\nof the Black Hole of Calcutta. So, after depositing my cloak and bag in\r\nan empty seat, I quietly propped both doors open with a stick of wood,\r\nshut up the stoves, and opened all the ventilators with the poker. But\r\nthe celestial breeze, so grateful to me, had the most unhappy effect on\r\nthe slumbering exiles. Paterfamilias swore outright; the companion of\r\nhis earthly pilgrimage said, \"We must be going north,\" and, as the heavy\r\nveil of carbonic acid gas was lifted from infant faces, and the pure\r\noxygen filled their lungs and roused them to new life, they set up one\r\nsimultaneous shout of joy and gratitude, which their parents mistook for\r\nagony. Altogether there was a general stir. As I had quietly slipped\r\ninto my seat and laid my head down to sleep, I remained unobserved--the\r\ninnocent cause of the general purification and vexation.\r\n\r\nWe reached Freeport at three o'clock in the morning. As the depot for\r\nDubuque was nearly half a mile on the other side of the town, I said to\r\na solitary old man who stood shivering there to receive us, \"How can I\r\nget to the other station?\" \"Walk, madam.\" \"But I do not know the way.\"\r\n\"There is no one to go with you.\" \"How is my trunk going?\" said I. \"I\r\nhave a donkey and cart to take that.\" \"Then,\" said I, \"you, the donkey,\r\nthe trunk, and I will go together.\" So I stepped into the cart, sat down\r\non the trunk, and the old man laughed heartily as we jogged along\r\nthrough the mud of that solitary town in the pale morning starlight.\r\nJust as the day was dawning, Dubuque, with its rough hills and bold\r\nscenery, loomed up. Soon, under the roof of Myron Beach, one of the\r\ndistinguished lawyers of the West, with a good breakfast and sound nap,\r\nmy night's sorrows were forgotten.\r\n\r\nI was sorry to find that Mrs. Beach, though a native of New York, and\r\nborn on the very spot where the first woman's rights convention was held\r\nin this country, was not sound on the question of woman suffrage. She\r\nseemed to have an idea that voting and housekeeping could not be\r\ncompounded; but I suggested that, if the nation could only enjoy a\r\nlittle of the admirable system with which she and other women\r\nadministered their domestic affairs, Uncle Sam's interests would be\r\nbetter secured. This is just what the nation needs to-day, and women\r\nmust wake up to the consideration that they, too, have duties as well as\r\nrights in the State. A splendid audience greeted me in the Opera House,\r\nand I gave \"Our Girls,\" bringing many male sinners to repentance, and\r\nstirring up some lethargic _femmes coverts_ to a state of rebellion\r\nagainst the existing order of things.\r\n\r\nFrom Dubuque I went to Dixon, a large town, where I met a number of\r\npleasant people, but I have one cause of complaint against the telegraph\r\noperator, whose negligence to send a dispatch to Mt. Vernon, written and\r\npaid for, came near causing me a solitary night on the prairie,\r\nunsheltered and unknown. Hearing that the express train went out Sunday\r\nafternoon, I decided to go, so as to have all day at Mt. Vernon before\r\nspeaking; but on getting my trunk checked, the baggageman said the train\r\ndid not stop there. \"Well,\" said I, \"check the trunk to the nearest\r\npoint at which it does stop,\" resolving that I would persuade the\r\nconductor to stop one minute, anyway. Accordingly, when the conductor\r\ncame round, I presented my case as persuasively and eloquently as\r\npossible, telling him that I had telegraphed friends to meet me, etc.,\r\netc. He kindly consented to do so and had my trunk re-checked. On\r\narriving, as there was no light, no sound, and the depot was half a mile\r\nfrom the town, the conductor urged me to go to Cedar Rapids and come\r\nback the next morning, as it was Sunday night and the depot might not be\r\nopened, and I might be compelled to stay there on the platform all night\r\nin the cold.\r\n\r\nBut, as I had telegraphed, I told him I thought someone would be there,\r\nand I would take the risk. So off went the train, leaving me solitary\r\nand alone. I could see the lights in the distant town and the dark\r\noutlines of two great mills near by, which suggested dams and races. I\r\nheard, too, the distant barking of dogs, and I thought there might be\r\nwolves, too; but no human sound. The platform was high and I could see\r\nno way down, and I should not have dared to go down if I had. So I\r\nwalked all round the house, knocked at every door and window, called\r\n\"John!\" \"James!\" \"Patrick!\" but no response. Dressed in all their best,\r\nthey had, no doubt, gone to visit Sally, and I knew they would stay\r\nlate. The night wind was cold. What could I do? The prospect of spending\r\nthe night there filled me with dismay. At last I thought I would try my\r\nvocal powers; so I hallooed as loud as I could, in every note of the\r\ngamut, until I was hoarse. At last I heard a distant sound, a loud\r\nhalloo, which I returned, and so we kept it up until the voice grew\r\nnear, and, when I heard a man's heavy footsteps close at hand, I was\r\nrelieved. He proved to be the telegraph operator, who had been a brave\r\nsoldier in the late war. He said that no message had come from Dixon. He\r\nescorted me to the hotel, where some members of the Lyceum Committee\r\ncame in and had a hearty laugh at my adventure, especially that, in my\r\ndistress, I should have called on James and John and Patrick, instead of\r\nJane, Ann, and Bridget. They seemed to argue that that was an admission,\r\non my part, of man's superiority, but I suggested that, as my sex had\r\nnot yet been exalted to the dignity of presiding in depots and baggage\r\nrooms, there would have been no propriety in calling Jane and Ann.\r\n\r\nMt. Vernon was distinguished for a very flourishing Methodist college,\r\nopen to boys and girls alike. The president and his wife were liberal\r\nand progressive people. I dined with them in their home near the\r\ncollege, and met some young ladies from Massachusetts, who were teachers\r\nin the institution. All who gathered round the social board on that\r\noccasion were of one mind on the woman question. Even the venerable\r\nmother of the president seemed to light up with the discussion of the\r\ntheme. I gave \"Our Girls\" in the Methodist church, and took the\r\nopportunity to compliment them for taking the word \"obey\" out of their\r\nmarriage ceremony. I heard the most encouraging reports of the\r\nexperiment of educating the sexes together. It was the rule in all the\r\nMethodist institutions in Iowa, and I found that the young gentlemen\r\nfully approved of it.\r\n\r\nAt Mt. Vernon I also met Mr. Wright, former Secretary of State, who gave\r\nme several interesting facts in regard to the women of Iowa. The State\r\ncould boast one woman who was an able lawyer, Mrs. Mansfield. Mrs. Berry\r\nand Mrs. Stebbins were notaries public. Miss Addington was\r\nsuperintendent of schools in Mitchell County. She was nominated by a\r\nconvention in opposition to a Mr. Brown. When the vote was taken, lo!\r\nthere was a tie. Mr. Brown offered to yield through courtesy, but she\r\ndeclined; so they drew lots and Miss Addington was the victor. She once\r\nmade an abstract of titles of all the lands in the county where she\r\nlived, and had received an appointment to office from the Governor of\r\nthe State, who requested the paper to be made out \"L.\" instead of Laura\r\nAddington. He said it was enough for Iowa to appoint women to such\r\noffices, without having it known the world over. I was sorry to tell the\r\nGovernor's secrets,--which I did everywhere,--but the cause of womanhood\r\nmade it necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nWESTWARD HO!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of June, 1871, Miss Anthony and I went to California,\r\nholding suffrage meetings in many of the chief cities from New York to\r\nSan Francisco, where we arrived about the middle of July, in time to\r\nexperience the dry, dusty season.\r\n\r\nWe tarried, on the way, one week in Salt Lake City. It was at the time\r\nof the Godby secession, when several hundred Mormons abjured that\r\nportion of the faith of their fathers which authorized polygamy. A\r\ndecision had just been rendered by the United States Supreme Court\r\ndeclaring the first wife and her children the only legal heirs. Whether\r\nthis decision hastened the secession I do not know; however, it gave us\r\nthe advantage of hearing all the arguments for and against the system.\r\nThose who were opposed to it said it made slaves of men. To support four\r\nwives and twenty children was a severe strain on any husband. The women\r\nwho believed in polygamy had much to say in its favor, especially in\r\nregard to the sacredness of motherhood during the period of pregnancy\r\nand lactation; a lesson of respect for that period being religiously\r\ntaught all Mormons.\r\n\r\nWe were very thankful for the privilege granted us of speaking to the\r\nwomen alone in the smaller Tabernacle. Our meeting opened at two o'clock\r\nand lasted until seven, giving us five hours of uninterrupted\r\nconversation. Judge McKeon had informed me of the recent decisions and\r\nthe legal aspects of the questions, which he urged me to present to them\r\nfully and frankly, as no one had had such an opportunity before to speak\r\nto Mormon women alone. So I made the most of my privilege. I gave a\r\nbrief history of the marriage institution in all times and countries, of\r\nthe matriarchate, when the mother was the head of the family and owned\r\nthe property and children; of the patriarchate, when man reigned supreme\r\nand woman was enslaved; of polyandry, polygamy, monogamy, and\r\nprostitution. We had a full and free discussion of every phase of the\r\nquestion, and we all agreed that we were still far from having reached\r\nthe ideal position for woman in marriage, however satisfied man might be\r\nwith his various experiments. Though the Mormon women, like all others,\r\nstoutly defend their own religion, yet they are no more satisfied than\r\nany other sect. All women are dissatisfied with their position as\r\ninferiors, and their dissatisfaction increases in exact ratio with their\r\nintelligence and development.\r\n\r\nAfter this convocation the doors of the Tabernacle were closed to our\r\nministrations, as we thought they would be, but we had crowded an\r\nimmense amount of science, philosophy, history, and general reflections\r\ninto the five hours of such free talk as those women had never heard\r\nbefore. As the seceders had just built a new hall, we held meetings\r\nthere every day, discussing all the vital issues of the hour; the Mormon\r\nmen and women taking an active part.\r\n\r\nWe attended the Fourth of July celebration, and saw the immense\r\nTabernacle filled to its utmost capacity. The various States of the\r\nUnion were represented by young girls, gayly dressed, carrying beautiful\r\nflags and banners. When that immense multitude joined in our national\r\nsongs, and the deep-toned organ filled the vast dome the music was very\r\nimpressive, and the spirit of patriotism manifested throughout was deep\r\nand sincere.\r\n\r\nAs I stood among these simple people, so earnest in making their\r\nexperiment in religion and social life, and remembered all the\r\npersecutions they had suffered and all they had accomplished in that\r\ndesolate, far-off region, where they had, indeed, made \"the wilderness\r\nblossom like the rose,\" I appreciated, as never before, the danger of\r\nintermeddling with the religious ideas of any people. Their faith finds\r\nabundant authority in the Bible, in the example of God's chosen people.\r\nWhen learned ecclesiastics teach the people that they can safely take\r\nthat book as the guide of their lives, they must expect them to follow\r\nthe letter and the specific teachings that lie on the surface. The\r\nordinary mind does not generalize nor see that the same principles of\r\nconduct will not do for all periods and latitudes. When women understand\r\nthat governments and religions are human inventions; that Bibles,\r\nprayerbooks, catechisms, and encyclical letters are all emanations from\r\nthe brain of man, they will no longer be oppressed by the injunctions\r\nthat come to them with the divine authority of \"Thus saith the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nThat thoroughly democratic gathering in the Tabernacle impressed me more\r\nthan any other Fourth of July celebration I ever attended. As most of\r\nthe Mormon families keep no servants, mothers must take their children\r\nwherever they go--to churches, theatres, concerts, and military\r\nreviews--everywhere and anywhere. Hence the low, pensive wail of the\r\nindividual baby, combining in large numbers, becomes a deep monotone,\r\nlike the waves of the sea, a sort of violoncello accompaniment to all\r\ntheir holiday performances. It was rather trying to me at first to have\r\nmy glowing periods punctuated with a rhythmic wail from all sides of the\r\nhall; but as soon as I saw that it did not distract my hearers, I simply\r\nraised my voice, and, with a little added vehemence, fairly rivaled the\r\nbabies. Commenting on this trial, to one of the theatrical performers,\r\nhe replied: \"It is bad enough for you, but alas! imagine me in a tender\r\ndeath scene, when the most profound stillness is indispensable, having\r\nmy last gasp, my farewell message to loved ones, accentuated with the\r\njoyful crowings or impatient complainings of fifty babies.\" I noticed in\r\nthe Tabernacle that the miseries of the infantile host were in a measure\r\nmitigated by constant draughts of cold water, borne around in buckets by\r\nfour old men.\r\n\r\nThe question of the most profound interest to us at that time, in the\r\nMormon experiment, was the exercise of the suffrage by women. Emeline B.\r\nWells, wife of the Mayor of the city, writing to a Washington\r\nconvention, in 1894, said of the many complications growing out of\r\nvarious bills before Congress to rob women of this right:\r\n\r\n     \"Women have voted in Utah fourteen years, but, because of the\r\n     little word 'male' that still stands upon the statutes, no woman is\r\n     eligible to any office of emolument or trust. In three successive\r\n     legislatures, bills have been passed, providing that the word\r\n     'male' be erased; but, each time, the Governor of the Territory,\r\n     who has absolute veto power, has refused his signature. Yet women\r\n     attend primary meetings in the various precincts and are chosen as\r\n     delegates. They are also members of county and territorial central\r\n     committees, and are thus gaining practical political experience,\r\n     and preparing themselves for positions of trust.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1882 a convention was held to frame a constitution to be\r\n     submitted to the people and presented to the Congress of the United\r\n     States. Women were delegates to this convention, and took part in\r\n     all its deliberations, and were appointed to act on committees with\r\n     equal privileges. It is the first instance on record, I think,\r\n     where women have been members and taken an active part in a\r\n     constitutional convention.\r\n\r\n     \"Much has been said and written, and justly, too, of suffrage for\r\n     women in Wyoming; but, in my humble opinion, had Utah stood on the\r\n     same ground as Wyoming, and women been eligible to office, as they\r\n     are in that Territory, they would, ere this, have been elected to\r\n     the legislative Assembly of Utah.\r\n\r\n     \"It is currently reported that Mormon women vote as they are told\r\n     by their husbands. I most emphatically deny the assertion. All\r\n     Mormon women vote who are privileged to register. Every girl born\r\n     here, as soon as she is twenty-one years old, registers, and\r\n     considers it as much a duty as to say her prayers. Our women vote\r\n     with the same freedom that characterizes any class of people in the\r\n     most conscientious acts of their lives.\"\r\n\r\nThese various questions were happily solved in 1895, when Utah became a\r\nState. Its Constitution gives women the right to vote on all questions,\r\nand makes them eligible to any office.\r\n\r\nThe journey over the Rocky Mountains was more interesting and wonderful\r\nthan I had imagined. A heavy shower the morning we reached the alkali\r\nplains made the trip through that region, where travelers suffer so\r\nmuch, quite endurable. Although we reached California in its hot, dry\r\nseason, we found the atmosphere in San Francisco delightful, fanned with\r\nthe gentle breezes of the Pacific, cooled with the waters of its\r\nmagnificent harbor. The Golden Gate does indeed open to the eye of the\r\ntraveler one of the most beautiful harbors in the world.\r\n\r\nFriends had engaged for us a suite of apartments at the Grand Hotel,\r\nthen just opened. Our rooms were constantly decked with fresh flowers,\r\nwhich our \"suffrage children,\" as they called themselves, brought us\r\nfrom day to day. So many brought tokens of their good will--in fact, all\r\nour visitors came with offerings of fruits and flowers--that not only\r\nour apartments, but the public tables were crowded with rare and\r\nbeautiful specimens of all varieties. We spoke every night, to crowded\r\nhouses, on all phases of the woman question, and had a succession of\r\nvisitors during the day. In fact, for one week, we had a perfect\r\novation. As Senator Stanford and his wife were at the same hotel, we had\r\nmany pleasant interviews with them.\r\n\r\nWhile in San Francisco we had many delightful sails in the harbor and\r\ndrives to the seashore and for miles along the beach. We spent several\r\nhours at the little Ocean House, watching the gambols of the celebrated\r\nseals. These, like the big trees, were named after distinguished\r\nstatesmen. One very black fellow was named Charles Sumner, in honor of\r\nhis love of the black race; another, with a little squint in his eye,\r\nwas called Ben Butler; a stout, rotund specimen that seemed to take life\r\nphilosophically, was named Senator Davis of Illinois; a very belligerent\r\none, who appeared determined to crowd his confrères into the sea, was\r\ncalled Secretary Stanton. Grant and Lincoln, on a higher ledge of the\r\nrocks, were complacently observing the gambols of the rest.\r\n\r\nCalifornia was on the eve of an important election, and John A. Bingham\r\nof Ohio and Senator Cole were stumping the State for the Republican\r\nparty. At several points we had the use of their great tents for our\r\naudiences, and of such of their able arguments as applied to woman. As\r\nMr. Bingham's great speech was on the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and\r\nFifteenth Amendments, every principle he laid down literally\r\nenfranchised the women of the nation. I met the Ohio statesman one\r\nmorning at breakfast, after hearing him the night before. I told him his\r\nlogic must compel him to advocate woman suffrage. With a most cynical\r\nsmile he said \"he was not the puppet of logic, but the slave of\r\npractical politics.\"\r\n\r\nWe met most of our suffrage coadjutors in different parts of California.\r\nI spent a few days with Mrs. Elizabeth B. Schenck, one of the earliest\r\npioneers in the suffrage movement. She was a cultivated, noble woman,\r\nand her little cottage was a gem of beauty and comfort, surrounded with\r\nbeautiful gardens and a hedge of fish-geraniums over ten feet high,\r\ncovered with scarlet flowers. It seemed altogether more like a fairy\r\nbower than a human habitation. The windmills all over California, for\r\npumping water, make a very pretty feature in the landscape, as well as\r\nan important one, as people are obliged to irrigate their gardens\r\nduring the dry season. In August the hills are as brown as ours in\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nHere, too, I first met Senator Sargent's family, and visited them in\r\nSacramento City, where we had a suffrage meeting in the evening and one\r\nfor women alone next day. At a similar meeting in San Francisco six\r\nhundred women were present in Platt's Hall. We discussed marriage,\r\nmaternity, and social life in general. Supposing none but women were\r\npresent, as all were dressed in feminine costume, the audience were\r\nquite free in their questions, and I equally so in my answers. To our\r\nastonishment, the next morning, a verbatim report of all that was said\r\nappeared in one of the leading papers, with most respectful comments. As\r\nI always wrote and read carefully what I had to say on such delicate\r\nsubjects, the language was well chosen and the presentation of facts and\r\nphilosophy quite unobjectionable; hence, the information being as\r\nimportant for men as for women, I did not regret the publication. During\r\nthe day a committee of three gentlemen called to know if I would give a\r\nlecture to men alone. As I had no lecture prepared, I declined, with the\r\npromise to do so the next time I visited California. The idea was novel,\r\nbut I think women could do much good in that way.\r\n\r\nMy readers may be sure that such enterprising travelers as Miss Anthony\r\nand myself visited all the wonders, saw the geysers, big trees, the\r\nYosemite Valley, and the immense mountain ranges, piled one above\r\nanother, until they seemed to make a giant pathway from earth to heaven.\r\nWe drove down the mountain sides with Fox, the celebrated whip; sixteen\r\npeople in an open carriage drawn by six horses, down, down, down, as\r\nfast as we could go. I expected to be dashed to pieces, but we safely\r\ndescended in one hour, heights we had taken three to climb. Fox held a\r\nsteady rein, and seemed as calm as if we were trotting on a level,\r\nthough any accident, such as a hot axle, a stumbling horse, or a break\r\nin the harness would have sent us down the mountain side, two thousand\r\nfeet, to inevitable destruction. He had many amusing anecdotes to tell\r\nof Horace Greeley's trip to the Geysers. The distinguished journalist\r\nwas wholly unprepared for the race down the mountains and begged Fox to\r\nhold up. Sitting in front he made several efforts to seize the lines.\r\nBut Fox assured him that was the only possible way they could descend in\r\nsafety, as the horses could guide the stage, but they could not hold it.\r\n\r\nAt Stockton we met a party of friends just returning from the Yosemite,\r\nwho gave us much valuable information for the journey. Among other\r\nthings, I was advised to write to Mr. Hutchins, the chief authority\r\nthere, to have a good, strong horse in readiness to take me down the\r\nsteep and narrow path into the valley. We took the same driver and\r\ncarriage which our friends had found trustworthy, and started early in\r\nthe morning. The dust and heat made the day's journey very wearisome,\r\nbut the prospect of seeing the wonderful valley made all hardships of\r\nlittle consequence. Quite a large party were waiting to mount their\r\ndonkeys and mules when we arrived. One of the attendants, a man about as\r\nthin as a stair rod, asked me if I was the lady who had ordered a strong\r\nhorse; I being the stoutest of the party, he readily arrived at that\r\nconclusion, so my steed was promptly produced. But I knew enough of\r\nhorses and riding to see at a glance that he was a failure, with his low\r\nwithers and high haunches, for descending steep mountains. In addition\r\nto his forward pitch, his back was immensely broad. Miss Anthony and I\r\ndecided to ride astride and had suits made for that purpose; but alas!\r\nmy steed was so broad that I could not reach the stirrups, and the\r\nmoment we began to descend, I felt as if I were going over his head. So\r\nI fell behind, and, when the party had all gone forward, I dismounted,\r\nthough my slender guide assured me there was no danger, he \"had been up\r\nand down a thousand times.\" But, as I had never been at all, his\r\nrepeated experiences did not inspire me with courage. I decided to walk.\r\nThat, the guide said, was impossible. \"Well,\" said I, by way of\r\ncompromise, \"I will walk as far as I can, and when I reach the\r\nimpossible, I will try that ill-constructed beast. I cannot see what you\r\nmen were thinking of when you selected such an animal for this journey.\"\r\nAnd so we went slowly down, arguing the point whether it were better to\r\nride or walk; to trust one's own legs, or, by chance, be precipitated\r\nthousands of feet down the mountain side.\r\n\r\nIt was a hot August day; the sun, in the zenith, shining with full\r\npower. My blood was at boiling heat with exercise and vexation.\r\nAlternately sliding and walking, catching hold of rocks and twigs,\r\ndrinking at every rivulet, covered with dust, dripping with\r\nperspiration, skirts, gloves, and shoes in tatters, for four long hours\r\nI struggled down to the end, when I laid myself out on the grass, and\r\nfell asleep, perfectly exhausted, having sent the guide to tell Mr.\r\nHutchins that I had reached the valley, and, as I could neither ride nor\r\nwalk, to send a wheelbarrow, or four men with a blanket to transport me\r\nto the hotel. That very day the Mariposa Company had brought the first\r\ncarriage into the valley, which, in due time, was sent to my relief.\r\nMiss Anthony, who, with a nice little Mexican pony and narrow saddle,\r\nhad made her descent with grace and dignity, welcomed me on the steps of\r\nthe hotel, and laughed immoderately at my helpless plight.\r\n\r\nAs hour after hour had passed, she said, there had been a general\r\nwonderment as to what had become of me; \"but did you ever see such\r\nmagnificent scenery?\" \"Alas!\" I replied, \"I have been in no mood for\r\nscenery. I have been constantly watching my hands and feet lest I should\r\ncome to grief.\" The next day I was too stiff and sore to move a finger.\r\nHowever, in due time I awoke to the glory and grandeur of that wonderful\r\nvalley, of which no descriptions nor paintings can give the least idea.\r\nWith Sunset Cox, the leading Democratic statesman, and his wife, we had\r\nmany pleasant excursions through the valley, and chats, during the\r\nevening, on the piazza. There was a constant succession of people going\r\nand coming, even in that far-off region, and all had their adventures to\r\nrelate. But none quite equaled my experiences.\r\n\r\nWe spent a day in the Calaveras Grove, rested beneath the \"big trees,\"\r\nand rode on horseback through the fallen trunk of one of them. Some\r\nvandals sawed off one of the most magnificent specimens twenty feet\r\nabove the ground, and, on this the owners of the hotel built a little\r\noctagonal chapel. The polished wood, with bark for a border, made a very\r\npretty floor. Here they often had Sunday services, as it held about one\r\nhundred people. Here, too, we discussed the suffrage question, amid\r\nthese majestic trees that had battled with the winds two thousand\r\nyears, and had probably never before listened to such rebellion as we\r\npreached to the daughters of earth that day.\r\n\r\nHere, again, we found our distinguished statesmen immortalized, each\r\nwith his namesake among these stately trees. We asked our guide if there\r\nwere any not yet appropriated, might we name them after women. As he\r\nreadily consented, we wrote on cards the names of a dozen leading women,\r\nand tacked them on their respective trees. Whether Lucretia Mott, Lucy\r\nStone, Phoebe Couzins, and Anna Dickinson still retain their identity,\r\nand answer when called by the goddess Sylvia in that majestic grove, I\r\nknow not. Twenty-five years have rolled by since then, and a new\r\ngeneration of visitors and guides may have left no trace of our work\r\nbehind them. But we whispered our hopes and aspirations to the trees, to\r\nbe wafted to the powers above, and we left them indelibly pictured on\r\nthe walls of the little chapel, and for more mortal eyes we scattered\r\nleaflets wherever we went, and made all our pleasure trips so many\r\npropaganda for woman's enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nReturning from California I made the journey straight through from San\r\nFrancisco to New York. Though a long trip to make without a break, yet I\r\nenjoyed every moment, as I found most charming companions in Bishop\r\nJanes and his daughter. The Bishop being very liberal in his ideas, we\r\ndiscussed the various theologies, and all phases of the woman question.\r\nI shall never forget those pleasant conversations as we sat outside on\r\nthe platform, day after day, and in the soft moonlight late at night. We\r\ntook up the thread of our debate each morning where we had dropped it\r\nthe night before. The Bishop told me about the resolution to take the\r\nword \"obey\" from the marriage ceremony which he introduced, two years\r\nbefore, into the Methodist General Conference and carried with but\r\nlittle opposition. All praise to the Methodist Church! When our girls\r\nare educated into a proper self-respect and laudable pride of sex, they\r\nwill scout all these old barbarisms of the past that point in any way to\r\nthe subject condition of women in either the State, the Church, or the\r\nhome. Until the other sects follow her example, I hope our girls will\r\ninsist on having their conjugal knots all tied by Methodist bishops.\r\n\r\nThe Episcopal marriage service not only still clings to the word \"obey,\"\r\nbut it has a most humiliating ceremony in giving the bride away. I was\r\nnever more struck with its odious and ludicrous features than on once\r\nseeing a tall, queenly-looking woman, magnificently arrayed, married by\r\none of the tiniest priests that ever donned a surplice and gown, given\r\naway by the smallest guardian that ever watched a woman's fortunes, to\r\nthe feeblest, bluest-looking little groom that ever placed a wedding\r\nring on bridal finger. Seeing these Lilliputians around her, I thought,\r\nwhen the little priest said, \"Who gives this woman to this man,\" that\r\nshe would take the responsibility and say, \"I do,\" but no! there she\r\nstood, calm, serene, as if it were no affair of hers, while the little\r\nguardian, placing her hand in that of the little groom, said, \"I do.\"\r\nThus was this stately woman bandied about by these three puny men, all\r\nof whom she might have gathered up in her arms and borne off to their\r\nrespective places of abode.\r\n\r\nBut women are gradually waking up to the degradation of these\r\nceremonies. Not long since, at a wedding in high life, a beautiful girl\r\nof eighteen was struck dumb at the word \"obey.\" Three times the priest\r\npronounced it with emphasis and holy unction, each time slower, louder,\r\nthan before. Though the magnificent parlors were crowded, a breathless\r\nsilence reigned. Father, mother, and groom were in agony. The bride,\r\nwith downcast eyes, stood speechless. At length the priest slowly closed\r\nhis book and said, \"The ceremony is at an end.\" One imploring word from\r\nthe groom, and a faint \"obey\" was heard in the solemn stillness. The\r\npriest unclasped his book and the knot was tied. The congratulations,\r\nfeast, and all, went on as though there had been no break in the\r\nproceedings, but the lesson was remembered, and many a rebel made by\r\nthat short pause.\r\n\r\nI think all these reverend gentlemen who insist on the word \"obey\" in\r\nthe marriage service should be removed for a clear violation of the\r\nThirteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, which says there shall\r\nbe neither slavery nor involuntary servitude within the United States.\r\nAs I gave these experiences to Bishop Janes he laughed heartily, and\r\nasked me to repeat them to each newcomer. Our little debating society\r\nwas the center of attraction. One gentleman asked me if our woman\r\nsuffrage conventions were as entertaining. I told him yes; that there\r\nwere no meetings in Washington so interesting and so well attended as\r\nours.\r\n\r\nAs I had some woman-suffrage literature in my valise, I distributed\r\nleaflets to all earnest souls who plied me with questions. Like all\r\nother things, it requires great discretion in sowing leaflets, lest you\r\nexpose yourself to a rebuff. I never offer one to a man with a small\r\nhead and high heels on his boots, with his chin in the air, because I\r\nknow, in the nature of things, that he will be jealous of superior\r\nwomen; nor to a woman whose mouth has the \"prunes and prisms\"\r\nexpression, for I know she will say, \"I have all the rights I want.\"\r\nGoing up to London one day, a few years later, I noticed a saintly\r\nsister, belonging to the Salvation Army, timidly offering some leaflets\r\nto several persons on board; all coolly declined to receive them. Having\r\nhad much experience in the joys and sorrows of propagandism, I put out\r\nmy hand and asked her to give them to me. I thanked her and read them\r\nbefore reaching London. It did me no harm and her much good in thinking\r\nthat she might have planted a new idea in my mind. Whatever is given to\r\nus freely, I think, in common politeness, we should accept graciously.\r\n\r\nWhile I was enjoying once more the comforts of home, on the blue hills\r\nof Jersey, Miss Anthony was lighting the fires of liberty on the\r\nmountain tops of Oregon and Washington Territory. All through the months\r\nof October, November, and December, 1871, she was jolting about in\r\nstages, over rough roads, speaking in every hamlet where a schoolhouse\r\nwas to be found, and scattering our breezy leaflets to the four winds of\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nFrom 1869 to 1873 Miss Anthony and I made several trips through Iowa,\r\nMissouri, Illinois, and Nebraska, holding meetings at most of the chief\r\ntowns; I speaking in the afternoons to women alone on \"Marriage and\r\nMaternity.\" As Miss Anthony had other pressing engagements in Kansas and\r\nNebraska, I went alone to Texas, speaking in Dallas, Sherman, and\r\nHouston, where I was delayed two weeks by floods and thus prevented\r\nfrom going to Austin, Galveston, and some points in Louisiana, where I\r\nwas advertised to lecture. In fact I lost all my appointments for a\r\nmonth. However, there was a fine hotel in Houston and many pleasant\r\npeople, among whom I made some valuable acquaintances. Beside several\r\npublic meetings, I had parlor talks and scattered leaflets, so that my\r\ntime was not lost.\r\n\r\nAs the floods had upset my plans for the winter, I went straight from\r\nHouston to New York over the Iron Mountain Railroad. I anticipated a\r\nrather solitary trip; but, fortunately, I met General Baird, whom I\r\nknew, and some other army officers, who had been down on the Mexican\r\nborder to settle some troubles in the \"free zone.\" We amused ourselves\r\non the long journey with whist and woman suffrage discussions. We\r\nnoticed a dyspeptic-looking clergyman, evidently of a bilious\r\ntemperament, eying us very steadily and disapprovingly the first day,\r\nand in a quiet way we warned each other that, in due time, he would give\r\nus a sermon on the sin of card playing.\r\n\r\nSitting alone, early next morning, he seated himself by my side, and\r\nasked me if I would allow him to express his opinion on card playing. I\r\nsaid \"Oh, yes! I fully believe in free speech.\" \"Well,\" said he, \"I\r\nnever touch cards. I think they are an invention of the devil to lead\r\nunwary souls from all serious thought of the stern duties of life and\r\nthe realities of eternity! I was sorry to see you, with your white hair,\r\nprobably near the end of your earthly career, playing cards and talking\r\nwith those reckless army officers, who delight in killing their\r\nfellow-beings. No! I do not believe in war or card playing; such things\r\ndo not prepare the soul for heaven.\" \"Well,\" said I, \"you are quite\r\nright, with your views, to abjure the society of army officers and all\r\ngames of cards. You, no doubt, enjoy your own thoughts and the book you\r\nare reading, more than you would the conversation of those gentlemen and\r\na game of whist. We must regulate our conduct by our own highest ideal.\r\nWhile I deplore the necessity of war, yet I know in our Army many of the\r\nnoblest types of manhood, whose acquaintance I prize most highly. I\r\nenjoy all games, too, from chess down to dominoes. There is so much that\r\nis sad and stern in life that we need sometimes to lay down its burdens\r\nand indulge in innocent amusements. Thus, you see, what is wise from my\r\nstandpoint is unwise from yours. I am sorry that you repudiate all\r\namusements, as they contribute to the health of body and soul. You are\r\nsorry that I do not think as you do and regulate my life accordingly.\r\nYou are sure that you are right. I am equally sure that I am. Hence\r\nthere is nothing to be done in either case but to let each other alone,\r\nand wait for the slow process of evolution to give to each of us a\r\nhigher standard.\" Just then one of the officers asked me if I was ready\r\nfor a game of whist, and I excused myself from further discussion. I met\r\nmany of those dolorous saints in my travels, who spent so much thought\r\non eternity and saving their souls that they lost all the joys of time,\r\nas well as those sweet virtues of courtesy and charity that might best\r\nfit them for good works on earth and happiness in heaven.\r\n\r\nIn the spring I went to Nebraska, and Miss Anthony and I again made a\r\nWestern tour, sometimes together and sometimes by different routes. A\r\nconstitutional convention was in session in Lincoln, and it was\r\nproposed to submit an amendment to strike the word \"male\" from the\r\nConstitution. Nebraska became a State in March, 1867, and took \"Equality\r\nbefore the law\" as her motto. Her Territorial legislature had discussed,\r\nmany times, proposed liberal legislation for women, and her State\r\nlegislature had twice considered propositions for woman's\r\nenfranchisement. I had a valise with me containing Hon. Benjamin F.\r\nButler's minority reports as a member of the Judiciary Committee of the\r\nUnited States House of Representatives, in favor of woman's right to\r\nvote under the Fourteenth Amendment. As we were crossing the Platte\r\nRiver, in transferring the baggage to the boat, my valise fell into the\r\nriver. My heart stood still at the thought of such a fate for all those\r\nable arguments. After the great General had been in hot water all his\r\nlife, it was grievous to think of any of his lucubrations perishing in\r\ncold water at last. Fortunately they were rescued. On reaching Lincoln I\r\nwas escorted to the home of the Governor, where I spread the documents\r\nin the sunshine, and they were soon ready to be distributed among the\r\nmembers of the constitutional convention.\r\n\r\nAfter I had addressed the convention, some of the members called on me\r\nto discuss the points of my speech. All the gentlemen were serious and\r\nrespectful with one exception. A man with an unusually small head,\r\ndiminutive form, and crooked legs tried, at my expense, to be witty and\r\nfacetious. During a brief pause in the conversation he brought his chair\r\ndirectly before me and said, in a mocking tone, \"Don't you think that\r\nthe best thing a woman can do is to perform well her part in the role of\r\nwife and mother? My wife has presented me with eight beautiful\r\nchildren; is not this a better life-work than that of exercising the\r\nright of suffrage?\"\r\n\r\nI had had my eye on this man during the whole interview, and saw that\r\nthe other members were annoyed at his behavior. I decided, when the\r\nopportune moment arrived, to give him an answer not soon to be\r\nforgotten; so I promptly replied to his question, as I slowly viewed him\r\nfrom head to foot, \"I have met few men, in my life, worth repeating\r\neight times.\" The members burst into a roar of laughter, and one of\r\nthem, clapping him on the shoulder, said: \"There, sonny, you have read\r\nand spelled; you better go.\" This scene was heralded in all the Nebraska\r\npapers, and, wherever the little man went, he was asked why Mrs. Stanton\r\nthought he was not worth repeating eight times.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay in Lincoln there was a celebration of the opening of some\r\nrailroad. An immense crowd from miles about assembled on this occasion.\r\nThe collation was spread and speeches were made in the open air. The men\r\ncongratulated each other on the wonderful progress the State had made\r\nsince it became an organized Territory in 1854. There was not the\r\nslightest reference, at first, to the women. One speaker said: \"This\r\nState was settled by three brothers, John, James, and Joseph, and from\r\nthem have sprung the great concourse of people that greet us here\r\nto-day.\" I turned, and asked the Governor if all these people had\r\nsprung, Minerva-like, from the brains of John, James, and Joseph. He\r\nurged me to put that question to the speaker; so, in one of his eloquent\r\npauses, I propounded the query, which was greeted with loud and\r\nprolonged cheers, to the evident satisfaction of the women present. The\r\nnext speaker took good care to give the due meed of praise to Ann, Jane,\r\nand Mary, and to every mention of the mothers of Nebraska the crowd\r\nheartily responded.\r\n\r\nIn toasting \"the women of Nebraska,\" at the collation, I said: \"Here's\r\nto the mothers, who came hither by long, tedious journeys, closely\r\npacked with restless children in emigrant wagons, cooking the meals by\r\nday, and nursing the babies by night, while the men slept. Leaving\r\ncomfortable homes in the East, they endured all the hardships of pioneer\r\nlife, suffered, with the men, the attacks of the Dakota Indians and the\r\nconstant apprehension of savage raids, of prairie fires, and the\r\ndevastating locusts. Man's trials, his fears, his losses, all fell on\r\nwoman with double force; yet history is silent concerning the part woman\r\nperformed in the frontier life of the early settlers. Men make no\r\nmention of her heroism and divine patience; they take no thought of the\r\nmental or physical agonies women endure in the perils of maternity,\r\nofttimes without nurse or physician in the supreme hour of their need,\r\ngoing, as every mother does, to the very gates of death in giving life\r\nto an immortal being!\"\r\n\r\nTraveling all over these Western States in the early days, seeing the\r\nprivations women suffered, and listening to the tales of sorrow at the\r\nfireside, I wondered that men could ever forget the debt of gratitude\r\nthey owed to their mothers, or fail to commemorate their part in the\r\ngrowth of a great people. Yet the men of Nebraska have twice defeated\r\nthe woman suffrage amendment.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 Michigan was the point of interest to all those who had taken\r\npart in the woman-suffrage movement. The legislature, by a very large\r\nmajority, submitted to a vote of the electors an amendment of the\r\nConstitution, in favor of striking out the word \"male\" and thus securing\r\ncivil and political rights to the women of the State. It was a very\r\nactive campaign. Crowded meetings were held in all the chief towns and\r\ncities. Professor Moses Coit Tyler, and a large number of ministers\r\npreached, every Sunday, on the subject of woman's position. The\r\nMethodist conference passed a resolution in favor of the amendment by a\r\nunanimous vote. I was in the State during the intense heat of May and\r\nJune, speaking every evening to large audiences; in the afternoon to\r\nwomen alone, and preaching every Sunday in some pulpit. The Methodists,\r\nUniversalists, Unitarians, and Quakers all threw open their churches to\r\nthe apostles of the new gospel of equality for women. We spoke in jails,\r\nprisons, asylums, depots, and the open air. Wherever there were ears to\r\nhear, we lifted up our voices, and, on the wings of the wind, the glad\r\ntidings were carried to the remote corners of the State, and the votes\r\nof forty thousand men, on election day, in favor of the amendment were\r\nso many testimonials to the value of the educational work accomplished.\r\n\r\nI made many valuable acquaintances, on that trip, with whom I have\r\nmaintained lifelong friendships. One pleasant day I passed in the home\r\nof Governor Bagley and his wife, with a group of pretty children. I\r\nfound the Governor deeply interested in prison reform. He had been\r\ninstrumental in passing a law giving prisoners lights in their cells and\r\npleasant reading matter until nine o'clock. His ideas of what prisons\r\nshould be, as unfolded that day, have since been fully realized in the\r\ngrand experiment now being successfully tried at Elmira, New York.\r\n\r\nI visited the State prison at Jackson, and addressed seven hundred men\r\nand boys, ranging from seventy down to seventeen years of age. Seated on\r\nthe dais with the chaplain, I saw them file in to dinner, and, while\r\nthey were eating, I had an opportunity to study the sad, despairing\r\nfaces before me. I shall never forget the hopeless expression of one\r\nyoung man, who had just been sentenced for twenty years, nor how ashamed\r\nI felt that one of my own sex, trifling with two lovers, had fanned the\r\njealousy of one against the other, until the tragedy ended in the death\r\nof one and the almost lifelong imprisonment of the other. If girls\r\nshould be truthful and transparent in any relations in life, surely it\r\nis in those of love, involving the strongest passions of which human\r\nnature is capable. As the chaplain told me the sad story, and I noticed\r\nthe prisoner's refined face and well-shaped head, I felt that the young\r\nman was not under the right influences to learn the lesson he needed.\r\nFear, coercion, punishment, are the masculine remedies for moral\r\nweakness, but statistics show their failure for centuries. Why not\r\nchange the system and try the education of the moral and intellectual\r\nfaculties, cheerful surroundings, inspiring influences? Everything in\r\nour present system tends to lower the physical vitality, the\r\nself-respect, the moral tone, and to harden instead of reforming the\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\nMy heart was so heavy I did not know what to say to such an assembly of\r\nthe miserable. I asked the chaplain what I should say. \"Just what you\r\nplease,\" he replied. Thinking they had probably heard enough of their\r\nsins, their souls, and the plan of salvation, I thought I would give\r\nthem the news of the day. So I told them about the woman suffrage\r\namendment, what I was doing in the State, my amusing encounters with\r\nopponents, their arguments, my answers. I told them of the great changes\r\nthat would be effected in prison life when the mothers of the nation had\r\na voice in the buildings and discipline. I told them what Governor\r\nBagley said, and of the good time coming when prisons would no longer be\r\nplaces of punishment but schools of reformation. To show them what women\r\nwould do to realize this beautiful dream, I told them of Elizabeth Fry\r\nand Dorothea L. Dix, of Mrs. Farnham's experiment at Sing Sing, and\r\nLouise Michel's in New Caledonia, and, in closing, I said: \"Now I want\r\nall of you who are in favor of the amendment to hold up your right\r\nhands.\" They gave a unanimous vote, and laughed heartily when I said, \"I\r\ndo wish you could all go to the polls in November and that we could lock\r\nour opponents up here until after the election.\" I felt satisfied that\r\nthey had had one happy hour, and that I had said nothing to hurt the\r\nfeelings of the most unfortunate. As they filed off to their respective\r\nworkshops my faith and hope for brighter days went with them. Then I\r\nwent all through the prison. Everything looked clean and comfortable on\r\nthe surface, but I met a few days after a man, just set free, who had\r\nbeen there five years for forgery. He told me the true inwardness of the\r\nsystem; of the wretched, dreary life they suffered, and the brutality of\r\nthe keepers. He said the prison was infested with mice and vermin, and\r\nthat, during the five years he was there, he had never lain down one\r\nnight to undisturbed slumber. The sufferings endured in summer for want\r\nof air, he said, were indescribable. In this prison the cells were in\r\nthe center of the building, the corridors running all around by the\r\nwindows, so the prisoners had no outlook and no direct contact with the\r\nair. Hence, if a careless keeper forgot to open the windows after a\r\nstorm, the poor prisoners panted for air in their cells, like fish out\r\nof water. My informant worked in the mattress department, over the room\r\nwhere prisoners were punished. He said he could hear the lash and the\r\nscreams of the victims from morning till night. \"Hard as the work is all\r\nday,\" said he, \"it is a blessed relief to get out of our cells to march\r\nacross the yard and get one glimpse of the heavens above, and one breath\r\nof pure air, and to be in contact with other human souls in the\r\nworkshops, for, although we could never speak to each other, yet there\r\nwas a hidden current of sympathy conveyed by look that made us one in\r\nour misery.\"\r\n\r\nThough the press of the State was largely in our favor, yet there were\r\nsome editors who, having no arguments, exercised the little wit they did\r\npossess in low ridicule. It was in this campaign that an editor in a\r\nKalamazoo journal said: \"That ancient daughter of Methuselah, Susan B.\r\nAnthony, passed through our city yesterday, on her way to the Plainwell\r\nmeeting, with a bonnet on her head looking as if it had recently\r\ndescended from Noah's ark.\" Miss Anthony often referred to this\r\ndescription of herself, and said, \"Had I represented twenty thousand\r\nvoters in Michigan, that political editor would not have known nor cared\r\nwhether I was the oldest or the youngest daughter of Methuselah, or\r\nwhether my bonnet came from the ark or from Worth's.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT OF '76.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1876 was one of intense excitement and laborious activity\r\nthroughout the country. The anticipation of the centennial birthday of\r\nthe Republic, to be celebrated in Philadelphia, stirred the patriotism\r\nof the people to the highest point of enthusiasm. As each State was to\r\nbe represented in the great exhibition, local pride added another\r\nelement to the public interest. Then, too, everyone who could possibly\r\nafford the journey was making busy preparations to spend the Fourth of\r\nJuly, the natal day of the Republic, mid the scenes where the\r\nDeclaration of Independence was issued in 1776, the Government\r\ninaugurated, and the first national councils were held. Those interested\r\nin women's political rights decided to make the Fourth a woman's day,\r\nand to celebrate the occasion, in their various localities, by\r\ndelivering orations and reading their own declaration of rights, with\r\ndinners and picnics in the town halls or groves, as most convenient. But\r\nmany from every State in the Union made their arrangements to spend the\r\nhistoric period in Philadelphia. Owing, also, to the large number of\r\nforeigners who came over to join in the festivities, that city was\r\ncrammed to its utmost capacity. With the crowd and excessive heat,\r\ncomfort was everywhere sacrificed to curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm throughout the country had given a fresh impulse to the\r\nlyceum bureaus. Like the ferryboats in New York harbor, running hither\r\nand thither, crossing each other's tracks, the whole list of lecturers\r\nwere on the wing, flying to every town and city from San Francisco to\r\nNew York. As soon as a new railroad ran through a village of five\r\nhundred inhabitants that could boast a schoolhouse, a church, or a\r\nhotel, and one enterprising man or woman, a course of lectures was at\r\nonce inaugurated as a part of the winter's entertainments.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I was invited, by mistake, to a little town to lecture\r\nthe same evening when the Christy Minstrels were to perform. It was\r\narranged, as the town had only one hall, that I should speak from seven\r\nto eight o'clock and the minstrels should have the remainder of the\r\ntime. One may readily see that, with the minstrels in anticipation, a\r\nlecture on any serious question would occupy but a small place in the\r\nhearts of the people in a town where they seldom had entertainments of\r\nany kind. All the time I was speaking there was a running to and fro\r\nbehind the scenes, where the minstrels were transforming themselves with\r\npaints and curly wigs into Africans, and laughing at each other's jests.\r\nAs it was a warm evening, and the windows were open, the hilarity of the\r\nboys in the street added to the general din. Under such circumstances it\r\nwas difficult to preserve my equilibrium. I felt like laughing at my own\r\ncomical predicament, and I decided to make my address a medley of\r\nanecdotes and stories, like a string of beads, held together by a fine\r\nthread of argument and illustration. The moment the hand of the clock\r\npointed at eight o'clock the band struck up, thus announcing that the\r\nhappy hour for the minstrels had come. Those of my audience who wished\r\nto stay were offered seats at half price; those who did not, slipped\r\nout, and the crowd rushed in, soon packing the house to its utmost\r\ncapacity. I stayed, and enjoyed the performance of the minstrels more\r\nthan I had my own.\r\n\r\nAs the lyceum season lasted from October to June, I was late in reaching\r\nPhiladelphia. Miss Anthony and Mrs. Gage had already been through the\r\nagony of finding appropriate headquarters for the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation. I found them pleasantly situated on the lower floor of No.\r\n1431 Chestnut Street, with the work for the coming month clearly mapped\r\nout. As it was the year for nominating candidates for the presidency of\r\nthe United States, the Republicans and Democrats were about to hold\r\ntheir great' conventions. Hence letters were to be written to them\r\nrecommending a woman suffrage plank in their platforms, and asking seats\r\nfor women in the conventions, with the privilege of being heard in their\r\nown behalf. On these letters our united wisdom was concentrated, and\r\ntwenty thousand copies of each were published.\r\n\r\nThen it was thought pre-eminently proper that a Woman's Declaration of\r\nRights should be issued. Days and nights were spent over that document.\r\nAfter many twists from our analytical tweezers, with a critical\r\nconsideration of every word and sentence, it was at last, by a consensus\r\nof the competent, pronounced very good. Thousands were ordered to be\r\nprinted, and were folded, put in envelopes, stamped, directed, and\r\nscattered. Miss Anthony, Mrs. Gage, and I worked sixteen hours, day and\r\nnight, pressing everyone who came in, into the service, and late at\r\nnight carrying immense bundles to be mailed. With meetings, receptions,\r\nand a succession of visitors, all of whom we plied with woman suffrage\r\nliterature, we felt we had accomplished a great educational work.\r\n\r\nAmong the most enjoyable experiences at our headquarters were the\r\nfrequent visits of our beloved Lucretia Mott, who used to come from her\r\ncountry home bringing us eggs, cold chickens, and fine Oolong tea. As\r\nshe had presented us with a little black teapot that, like Mercury's\r\nmysterious pitcher of milk, filled itself for every coming guest, we\r\noften improvised luncheons with a few friends. At parting, Lucretia\r\nalways made a contribution to our depleted treasury. Here we had many\r\nprolonged discussions as to the part we should take, on the Fourth of\r\nJuly, in the public celebration. We thought it would be fitting for us\r\nto read our Declaration of Rights immediately after that of the Fathers\r\nwas read, as an impeachment of them and their male descendants for their\r\ninjustice and oppression. Ours contained as many counts, and quite as\r\nimportant, as those against King George in 1776. Accordingly, we applied\r\nto the authorities to allow us seats on the platform and a place in the\r\nprogramme of the public celebration, which was to be held in the\r\nhistoric old Independence Hall. As General Hawley was in charge of the\r\narrangements for the day, I wrote him as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"1431 Chestnut Street, July 1, 1876.\r\n\r\n     \"General Hawley.\r\n\r\n     \"_Honored Sir_: As President of the National Woman's Suffrage\r\n     Association, I am authorized to ask you for tickets to the\r\n     platform, at Independence Hall, for the celebration on the Fourth\r\n     of July. We should like to have seats for at least one\r\n     representative woman from each State. We also ask your permission\r\n     to read our Declaration of Rights immediately after the reading of\r\n     the Declaration of Independence of the Fathers is finished.\r\n     Although these are small favors to ask as representatives of\r\n     one-half of the nation, yet we shall be under great obligations to\r\n     you if granted.\r\n\r\n     \"Respectfully Yours,\r\n\r\n     \"Elizabeth Cady Stanton.\"\r\n\r\nTo this I received the following reply:\r\n\r\n     \"U.S.C.C. Headquarters, July 2.\r\n\r\n     \"Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton.\r\n\r\n     \"_Dear Madam_: I send you, with pleasure, half a dozen cards of\r\n     invitation. As the platform is already crowded, it is impossible to\r\n     reserve the number of seats you desire. I regret to say it is also\r\n     impossible for us to make any change in the programme at this late\r\n     hour. We are crowded for time to carry out what is already\r\n     proposed.\r\n\r\n     \"Yours Very Respectfully,\r\n\r\n     \"Joseph R. Hawley,\r\n\r\n     \"President, U.S.C.C.\"\r\n\r\nWith this rebuff, Mrs. Mott and I decided that we would not accept the\r\noffered seats, but would be ready to open our own convention called for\r\nthat day, at the First Unitarian church, where the Rev. William H.\r\nFurness had preached for fifty years. But some of our younger coadjutors\r\ndecided that they would occupy the seats and present our Declaration of\r\nRights. They said truly, women will be taxed to pay the expenses of\r\nthis celebration, and we have as good a right to that platform and to\r\nthe ears of the people as the men have, and we will be heard.\r\n\r\nThat historic Fourth of July dawned at last, one of the most oppressive\r\ndays of that heated season. Susan B. Anthony, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Sara\r\nAndrews Spencer, Lillie Devereux Blake, and Phoebe W. Couzins made their\r\nway through the crowds under the broiling sun of Independence Square,\r\ncarrying the Woman's Declaration of Rights. This Declaration had been\r\nhandsomely engrossed by one of their number, and signed by the oldest\r\nand most prominent advocates of woman's enfranchisement. Their tickets\r\nof admission proved an \"open sesame\" through the military barriers, and,\r\na few moments before the opening of the ceremonies, these women found\r\nthemselves within the precincts from which most of their sex were\r\nexcluded.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of 1776 was read by Richard Henry Lee of Virginia, about\r\nwhose family clusters so much historic fame. The moment he finished\r\nreading was determined upon as the appropriate time for the presentation\r\nof the Woman's Declaration. Not quite sure how their approach might be\r\nmet, not quite certain if, at this final moment, they would be permitted\r\nto reach the presiding officer, those ladies arose and made their way\r\ndown the aisle. The bustle of preparation for the Brazilian hymn covered\r\ntheir advance. The foreign guests and the military and civil officers\r\nwho filled the space directly in front of the speaker's stand,\r\ncourteously made way, while Miss Anthony, in fitting words, presented\r\nthe Declaration to the presiding officer. Senator Ferry's face paled as,\r\nbowing low, with no word he received the Declaration, which thus became\r\npart of the day's proceedings. The ladies turned, scattering printed\r\ncopies as they deliberately walked down the platform. On every side\r\neager hands were outstretched, men stood on seats and asked for them,\r\nwhile General Hawley, thus defied and beaten in his audacious denial to\r\nwomen of the right to present their Declaration, shouted, \"Order,\r\norder!\"\r\n\r\nPassing out, these ladies made their way to a platform, erected for the\r\nmusicians, in front of Independence Hall. Here, under the shadow of\r\nWashington's statue, back of them the old bell that proclaimed \"liberty\r\nto all the land and all the inhabitants thereof,\" they took their\r\nplaces, and, to a listening, applauding crowd, Miss Anthony read the\r\nWoman's Declaration. During the reading of the Declaration, Mrs. Gage\r\nstood beside Miss Anthony and held an umbrella over her head, to shelter\r\nher friend from the intense heat of the noonday sun. And thus in the\r\nsame hour, on opposite sides of old Independence Hall, did the men and\r\nwomen express their opinions on the great principles proclaimed on the\r\nnatal day of the Republic. The Declaration was handsomely framed, and\r\nnow hangs in the Vice President's room in the Capitol at Washington.\r\n\r\nThese heroic ladies then hurried from Independence Hall to the church,\r\nalready crowded with an expectant audience, to whom they gave a full\r\nreport of the morning's proceedings. The Hutchinsons of worldwide fame\r\nwere present in their happiest vein, interspersing the speeches with\r\nappropriate songs and felicitous remarks. For five long hours on that\r\nhot midsummer day a crowded audience, many standing, listened with\r\nprofound interest and reluctantly dispersed at last, all agreeing that\r\nit was one of the most impressive and enthusiastic meetings they had\r\never attended.\r\n\r\nAll through our Civil War the slaves on the Southern plantations had an\r\nabiding faith that the terrible conflict would result in freedom for\r\ntheir race. Just so through all the busy preparations of the Centennial,\r\nthe women of the nation felt sure that the great national celebration\r\ncould not pass without the concession of some new liberties to them.\r\nHence they pressed their claims at every point, at the Fourth of July\r\ncelebration in the exposition buildings, and in the Republican and\r\nDemocratic nominating conventions; hoping to get a plank in the\r\nplatforms of both the great political parties.\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Pavilion upon the centennial grounds was an afterthought, as\r\ntheologians claim woman herself to have been. The women of the country,\r\nafter having contributed nearly one hundred thousand dollars to the\r\ncentennial stock, found there had been no provision made for the\r\nseparate exhibition of their work. The centennial board, of which Mrs.\r\nGillespie was president, then decided to raise funds for the erection of\r\na separate building, to be known as the Woman's Pavilion. It covered an\r\nacre of ground, and was erected at an expense of thirty thousand\r\ndollars--a small sum in comparison with the money which had been raised\r\nby women and expended on the other buildings, not to speak of the State\r\nand national appropriations, which the taxes levied on them had largely\r\nhelped to swell.\r\n\r\nThe Pavilion was no true exhibit of woman's art. Few women are, as yet,\r\nowners of the business which their industry largely makes remunerative.\r\nCotton factories, in which thousands of women work, are owned by men.\r\nThe shoe business, in some branches of which women are doing more than\r\nhalf the work, is under the ownership of men. Rich embroideries from\r\nIndia, rugs of downy softness from Turkey, the muslin of Decca,\r\nanciently known as \"The Woven Wind,\" the pottery and majolica ware of P.\r\nPipsen's widow, the cartridges and envelopes of Uncle Sam, Waltham\r\nwatches, whose finest mechanical work is done by women, and ten thousand\r\nother industries found no place in the pavilion. Said United States\r\nCommissioner Meeker of Colorado, \"Woman's work comprises three-fourths\r\nof the exposition; it is scattered through every building; take it away,\r\nand there would be no exposition.\"\r\n\r\nBut this pavilion rendered one good service to woman in showing her\r\ncapabilities as an engineer. The boiler, which furnished the force for\r\nrunning its work, was under the charge of a young Canadian girl, Miss\r\nAllison, who, from childhood, had loved machinery, spending much time in\r\nthe large saw and grist mills of her father, run by engines of two and\r\nthree hundred horse-power, which she sometimes managed for amusement.\r\nWhen her name was proposed for running the pavilion machinery, it caused\r\nmuch opposition. It was said that the committee would, some day, find\r\nthe pavilion blown to atoms; that the woman engineer would spend her\r\ntime reading novels instead of watching the steam gauge; that the idea\r\nwas impracticable and should not be thought of. But Miss Allison soon\r\nproved her capabilities and the falseness of these prophecies by taking\r\nher place in the engine room and managing its workings with perfect\r\nease. Six power looms, on which women wove carpets, webbing, silks,\r\netc., were run by this engine. At a later period the printing of _The\r\nNew Century for Woman_, a paper published by the centennial commission\r\nin the woman's building, was done by its means. Miss Allison declared\r\nthe work to be more cleanly, more pleasant, and infinitely less\r\nfatiguing than cooking over a kitchen stove. \"Since I have been\r\ncompelled to earn my own living,\" she said, \"I have never been engaged\r\nin work I like so well. Teaching school is much harder, and one is not\r\npaid so well.\" She expressed her confidence in her ability to manage the\r\nengines of an ocean steamer, and said that there were thousands of small\r\nengines in use in various parts of the country, and no reason existed\r\nwhy women should not be employed to manage them,--following the\r\nprofession of engineer as a regular business,--an engine requiring far\r\nless attention than is given by a nursemaid or a mother to a child.\r\n\r\nBut to have made the Woman's Pavilion grandly historic, upon its walls\r\nshould have been hung the yearly protest of Harriet K. Hunt against\r\ntaxation without representation; the legal papers served upon the Smith\r\nsisters when, for their refusal to pay taxes while unrepresented, their\r\nAlderney cows were seized and sold; the papers issued by the city of\r\nWorcester for the forced sale of the house and lands of Abby Kelly\r\nFoster, the veteran abolitionist, because she refused to pay taxes,\r\ngiving the same reason our ancestors gave when they resisted taxation; a\r\nmodel of Bunker Hill monument, its foundation laid by Lafayette in 1825,\r\nbut which remained unfinished nearly twenty years, until the famous\r\nGerman danseuse, Fanny Ellsler, gave the proceeds of a public\r\nperformance for that purpose. With these should have been exhibited\r\nframed copies of all the laws bearing unjustly upon women--those which\r\nrob her of her name, her earnings, her property, her children, her\r\nperson; also the legal papers in the case of Susan B. Anthony, who was\r\ntried and fined for claiming her right to vote under the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment, and the decision of Mr. Justice Miller in the case of Myra\r\nBradwell, denying national protection for woman's civil rights; and the\r\nlater decision of Chief Justice Waite of the United States Supreme Court\r\nagainst Virginia L. Minor, denying women national protection for their\r\npolitical rights; decisions in favor of State rights which imperil the\r\nliberties not only of all women, but of every white man in the nation.\r\n\r\nWoman's most fitting contributions to the Centennial Exposition would\r\nhave been these protests, laws, and decisions, which show her political\r\nslavery. But all this was left for rooms outside of the centennial\r\ngrounds, upon Chestnut Street, where the National Woman's Suffrage\r\nAssociation hoisted its flag, made its protests, and wrote the\r\nDeclaration of Rights of the women of the United States.\r\n\r\nTo many thoughtful people it seemed captious and unreasonable for women\r\nto complain of injustice in this free land, amidst such universal\r\nrejoicings. When the majority of women are seemingly happy, it is\r\nnatural to suppose that the discontent of the minority is the result of\r\ntheir unfortunate individual idiosyncrasies, and not of adverse\r\ninfluences in established conditions. But the history of the world shows\r\nthat the vast majority, in every generation, passively accept the\r\nconditions into which they are born, while those who demanded larger\r\nliberties are ever a small, ostracized minority, whose claims are\r\nridiculed and ignored. From our standpoint we would honor any Chinese\r\nwoman who claimed the right to her feet and powers of locomotion; the\r\nHindoo widows who refused to ascend the funeral pyre of their husbands;\r\nthe Turkish women who threw off their masks and veils and left the\r\nharem; the Mormon women who abjured their faith and demanded monogamic\r\nrelations. Why not equally honor the intelligent minority of American\r\nwomen who protest against the artificial disabilities by which their\r\nfreedom is limited and their development arrested? That only a few,\r\nunder any circumstances, protest against the injustice of\r\nlong-established laws and customs, does not disprove the fact of the\r\noppressions, while the satisfaction of the many, if real, only proves\r\ntheir apathy and deeper degradation. That a majority of the women of the\r\nUnited States accept, without protest, the disabilities which grow out\r\nof their disfranchisement is simply an evidence of their ignorance and\r\ncowardice, while the minority who demand a higher political status\r\nclearly prove their superior intelligence and wisdom.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Forty-seventh Congress we made two new demands:\r\nFirst, for a special committee to consider all questions in regard to\r\nthe civil and political rights of women. We naturally asked the\r\nquestion, As Congress has a special committee on the rights of Indians,\r\nwhy not on those of women? Are not women, as a factor in civilization,\r\nof more importance than Indians? Secondly, we asked for a room, in the\r\nCapitol, where our committee could meet, undisturbed, whenever they saw\r\nfit. Though these points were debated a long time, our demands were\r\nacceded to at last. We now have our special committee, and our room,\r\nwith \"Woman Suffrage\" in gilt letters, over the door. In our struggle\r\nto achieve this, while our champion, the senior Senator from\r\nMassachusetts, stood up bravely in the discussion, the opposition not\r\nonly ridiculed the special demand, but all attempts to secure the civil\r\nand political rights of women. As an example of the arguments of the\r\nopposition, I give what the Senator from Missouri said. It is a fair\r\nspecimen of all that was produced on that side of the debate. Mr. Vest's\r\npoetical flights are most inspiring:\r\n\r\n     \"The Senate now has forty-one committees, with a small army of\r\n     messengers and clerks, one-half of whom, without exaggeration, are\r\n     literally without employment. I shall not pretend to specify the\r\n     committees of this body which have not one single bill, resolution,\r\n     or proposition of any sort pending before them, and have not had\r\n     for months. But, Mr. President, out of all committees without\r\n     business, and habitually without business, in this body, there is\r\n     one that, beyond any question, could take jurisdiction of this\r\n     matter and do it ample justice. I refer to that most respectable\r\n     and antique institution, the Committee on Revolutionary Claims. For\r\n     thirty years it has been without business. For thirty long years\r\n     the placid surface of that parliamentary sea has been without one\r\n     single ripple. If the Senator from Massachusetts desires a tribunal\r\n     for a calm, judicial equilibrium and examination--a tribunal far\r\n     from the 'madding crowd's ignoble strife'--a tribunal eminently\r\n     respectable, dignified and unique; why not send this question to\r\n     the Committee on Revolutionary Claims? It is eminently proper that\r\n     this subject should go to that committee because, if there is any\r\n     revolutionary claim in this country, it is that of woman suffrage.\r\n     (Laughter.) It revolutionizes society; it revolutionizes religion;\r\n     it revolutionizes the Constitution and laws; and it revolutionizes\r\n     the opinions of those so old-fashioned among us as to believe that\r\n     the legitimate and proper sphere of woman is the family circle, as\r\n     wife and mother, and not as politician and voter--those of us who\r\n     are proud to believe that\r\n\r\n    \"Woman's noblest station is retreat:\r\n    Her fairest virtues fly from public sight;\r\n    Domestic worth--that shuns too strong a light.\r\n\r\n     \"Before that Committee on Revolutionary Claims why could not this\r\n     most revolutionary of all claims receive immediate and ample\r\n     attention? More than that, as I said before, if there is any\r\n     tribunal that could give undivided time and dignified attention, is\r\n     it not this committee? If there is one peaceful haven of rest,\r\n     never disturbed by any profane bill or resolution of any sort, it\r\n     is the Committee on Revolutionary Claims. It is, in parliamentary\r\n     life, described by that ecstatic verse in Watts'\r\n     hymn--\r\n\r\n    \"There shall I bathe my wearied soul\r\n     In seas of endless rest.\r\n    And not one wave of trouble roll\r\n     Across my peaceful breast.\r\n\r\n     \"By all natural laws, stagnation breeds disease and death, and what\r\n     could stir up this most venerable and respectable institution more\r\n     than an application of the strong-minded, with short hair and\r\n     shorter skirts, invading its dignified realm and elucidating all\r\n     the excellences of female suffrage. Moreover, if these ladies could\r\n     ever succeed in the providence of God in obtaining a report from\r\n     that committee, it would end this question forever; for the public\r\n     at large and myself included, in view of that miracle of female\r\n     blandishment and female influence, would surrender at once, and\r\n     female suffrage would become constitutional and lawful. Sir, I\r\n     insist upon it that, in deference to this committee, in deference\r\n     to the fact that it needs this sort of regimen and medicine, this\r\n     whole subject should be so referred.\"\r\n\r\nThis gives a very fair idea of the character of the arguments produced\r\nby our opponents, from the inauguration of the movement. But, as there\r\nare no arguments in a republican government in favor of an aristocracy\r\nof sex, ridicule was really the only available weapon. After declaring\r\n\"that no just government can be formed without the consent of the\r\ngoverned,\" \"that taxation without representation is tyranny,\" it is\r\ndifficult to see on what basis one-half the people are disfranchised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nWRITING \"THE HISTORY OF WOMAN SUFFRAGE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe four years following the Centennial were busy, happy ones, of varied\r\ninterests and employments, public and private. Sons and daughters\r\ngraduating from college, bringing troops of young friends to visit us;\r\nthe usual matrimonial entanglements, with all their promises of\r\ncelestial bliss intertwined with earthly doubts and fears; weddings,\r\nvoyages to Europe, business ventures--in this whirl of plans and\r\nprojects our heads, hearts, and hands were fully occupied. Seven boys\r\nand girls dancing round the fireside, buoyant with all life's joys\r\nopening before them, are enough to keep the most apathetic parents on\r\nthe watch-towers by day and anxious even in dreamland by night. My spare\r\ntime, if it can be said that I ever had any, was given during these days\r\nto social festivities. The inevitable dinners, teas, picnics, and dances\r\nwith country neighbors, all came round in quick succession. We lived, at\r\nthis time, at Tenafly, New Jersey, not far from the publisher of the\r\n_Sun_, Isaac W. England, who also had seven boys and girls as full of\r\nfrolic as our own. Mrs. England and I entered into all their games with\r\nequal zest. The youngest thought half the fun was to see our enthusiasm\r\nin \"blindman's buff,\" \"fox and geese,\" and \"bean bags.\" It thrills me\r\nwith delight, even now, to see these games!\r\n\r\nMr. England was the soul of hospitality. He was never more happy than\r\nwhen his house was crowded with guests, and his larder with all the\r\ndelicacies of the season. Though he and Mr. Stanton were both connected\r\nwith that dignified journal, the New York _Sun_, yet they often joined\r\nin the general hilarity. I laugh, as I write, at the memory of all the\r\nfrolics we had on the blue hills of Jersey.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the domestic cares which a large family involved, Mrs.\r\nGage, Miss Anthony, and I were already busy collecting material for \"The\r\nHistory of Woman Suffrage.\" This required no end of correspondence. Then\r\nmy lecturing trips were still a part of the annual programme. Washington\r\nconventions, too, with calls, appeals, resolutions, speeches and\r\nhearings before the Committees of Congress and State legislatures, all\r\nthese came round in the year's proceedings as regularly as pumpkin pies\r\nfor Thanksgiving, plum pudding for Christmas, and patriotism for\r\nWashington's birthday. Those who speak for glory or philanthropy are\r\nalways in demand for college commencements and Fourth of July orations,\r\nhence much of Miss Anthony's eloquence, as well as my own, was utilized\r\nin this way.\r\n\r\nOn October 18, 1880, I had an impromptu dinner party. Elizabeth Boynton\r\nHarbert, May Wright Thompson (now Sewall), Phoebe W. Couzins, and\r\nArethusa Forbes, returning from a Boston convention, all by chance met\r\nunder my roof. We had a very merry time talking over the incidents of\r\nthe convention, Boston proprieties, and the general situation. As I gave\r\nthem many early reminiscences, they asked if I had kept a diary. \"No,\" I\r\nsaid, \"not a pen scratch of the past have I except what might be\r\ngathered from many family letters.\" They urged me to begin a diary at\r\nonce; so I promised I would on my coming birthday.\r\n\r\nMy great grief that day was that we were putting in a new range, and had\r\nmade no preparations for dinner. This completely upset the presiding\r\ngenius of my culinary department, as she could not give us the bounteous\r\nfeast she knew was expected on such occasions. I, as usual, when there\r\nwas any lack in the viands, tried to be as brilliant as possible in\r\nconversation; discussing Nirvana, Karma, reincarnation, and thus turning\r\nattention from the evanescent things of earth to the joys of a life to\r\ncome,--not an easy feat to perform with strong-minded women,--but, in\r\nparting, they seemed happy and refreshed, and all promised to come\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBut we shall never meet there again, as the old, familiar oaks and the\r\nmajestic chestnut trees have passed into other hands. Strange lovers now\r\nwhisper their vows of faith and trust under the tree where a most\r\ncharming wedding ceremony--that of my daughter Margaret--was solemnized\r\none bright October day. All Nature seemed to do her utmost to heighten\r\nthe beauty of the occasion. The verdure was brilliant with autumnal\r\ntints, the hazy noonday sun lent a peculiar softness to every\r\nshadow--even the birds and insects were hushed to silence. As the\r\nwedding march rose soft and clear, two stately ushers led the way; then\r\na group of Vassar classmates, gayly decked in silks of different colors,\r\nfollowed by the bride and groom. An immense Saint Bernard dog, on his\r\nown account brought up the rear, keeping time with measured tread. He\r\ntook his seat in full view, watching, alternately, the officiating\r\nclergyman, the bride and groom, and guests, as if to say: \"What does\r\nall this mean?\" No one behaved with more propriety and no one looked\r\nmore radiant than he, with a ray of sunlight on his beautiful coat of\r\nlong hair, his bright brass collar, and his wonderful head. Bruno did\r\nnot live to see the old home broken up, but sleeps peacefully there,\r\nunder the chestnut trees, and fills a large place in many of our\r\npleasant memories.\r\n\r\nOn November 12, 1880, I was sixty-five years old, and, pursuant to my\r\npromise, I then began my diary. It was a bright, sunny day, but the\r\nfrost king was at work; all my grand old trees, that stood like\r\nsentinels, to mark the boundary of my domain, were stripped of their\r\nfoliage, and their brilliant colors had faded into a uniform brown; but\r\nthe evergreens and the tall, prim cedars held their own, and, when\r\ncovered with snow, their exquisite beauty brought tears to my eyes. One\r\nneed never be lonely mid beautiful trees.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts were with my absent children--Harriot in France, Theodore in\r\nGermany, Margaret with her husband and brother Gerrit, halfway across\r\nthe continent, and Bob still in college. I spent the day writing letters\r\nand walking up and down the piazza, and enjoyed, from my windows, a\r\nglorious sunset. Alone, on birthdays or holidays, one is very apt to\r\nindulge in sad retrospections. The thought of how much more I might have\r\ndone for the perfect development of my children than I had accomplished,\r\ndepressed me. I thought of all the blunders in my own life and in their\r\neducation. Little has been said of the responsibilities of parental\r\nlife; accordingly little or nothing has been done. I had such visions of\r\nparental duties that day that I came to the conclusion that parents\r\nnever could pay the debt they owe their children for bringing them into\r\nthis world of suffering, unless they can insure them sound minds in\r\nsound bodies, and enough of the good things of this life to enable them\r\nto live without a continual struggle for the necessaries of existence. I\r\nhave no sympathy with the old idea that children owe parents a debt of\r\ngratitude for the simple fact of existence, generally conferred without\r\nthought and merely for their own pleasure. How seldom we hear of any\r\nhigh or holy preparation for the office of parenthood! Here, in the most\r\nmomentous act of life, all is left to chance. Men and women, intelligent\r\nand prudent in all other directions, seem to exercise no forethought\r\nhere, but hand down their individual and family idiosyncrasies in the\r\nmost reckless mariner.\r\n\r\nOn November 13 the New York _Tribune_ announced the death of Lucretia\r\nMott, eighty-eight years old. Having known her in the flush of life,\r\nwhen all her faculties were at their zenith, and in the repose of age,\r\nwhen her powers began to wane, her withdrawal from among us seemed as\r\nbeautiful and natural as the changing foliage, from summer to autumn, of\r\nsome grand old oak I have watched and loved.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Miss Anthony and Mrs. Gage, on November 20, banished all\r\nfamily matters from my mind. What planning, now, for volumes, chapters,\r\nfootnotes, margins, appendices, paper, and type; of engravings, title,\r\npreface, and introduction! I had never thought that the publication of a\r\nbook required the consideration of such endless details. We stood\r\nappalled before the mass of material, growing higher and higher with\r\nevery mail, and the thought of all the reading involved made us feel as\r\nif our lifework lay before us. Six weeks of steady labor all day, and\r\noften until midnight, made no visible decrease in the pile of documents.\r\nHowever, before the end of the month we had our arrangements all made\r\nwith publishers and engravers, and six chapters in print. When we began\r\nto correct proof we felt as if something was accomplished. Thus we\r\nworked through the winter and far into the spring, with no change except\r\nthe Washington Convention and an occasional evening meeting in New York\r\ncity. We had frequent visits from friends whom we were glad to see.\r\nHither came Edward M. Davis, Sarah Pugh, Adeline Thompson, Frederick\r\nCabot of Boston, Dr. William F. Channing, and sweet little Clara Spence,\r\nwho recited for us some of the most beautiful selections in her\r\nrepertoire.\r\n\r\nIn addition we had numberless letters from friends and foes, some\r\npraising and some condemning our proposed undertaking, and, though much\r\nalone, we were kept in touch with the outside world. But so conflicting\r\nwas the tone of the letters that, if we had not taken a very fair gauge\r\nof ourselves and our advisers, we should have abandoned our project and\r\nburied all the valuable material collected, to sleep in pine boxes\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nAt this time I received a very amusing letter from the Rev. Robert\r\nCollyer, on \"literary righteousness,\" quizzing me for using one of his\r\nanecdotes in my sketch of Lucretia Mott, without giving him credit. I\r\nlaughed him to scorn, that he should have thought it was my duty to have\r\ndone so. I told him plainly that he belonged to a class of \"white male\r\ncitizens,\" who had robbed me of all civil and political rights; of\r\nproperty, children, and personal freedom; and now it ill became him to\r\ncall me to account for using one of his little anecdotes that, ten to\r\none, he had cribbed from some woman. I told him that I considered his\r\nwhole class as fair game for literary pilfering. That women had been\r\ntaxed to build colleges to educate men, and if we could pick up a\r\nliterary crumb that had fallen from their feasts, we surely had a right\r\nto it. Moreover, I told him that man's duty in the world was to work, to\r\ndig and delve for jewels, real and ideal, and lay them at woman's feet,\r\nfor her to use as she might see fit; that he should feel highly\r\ncomplimented, instead of complaining, that he had written something I\r\nthought worth using. He answered like the nobleman he is; susceptible of\r\ntaking in a new idea. He admitted that, in view of the shortcomings of\r\nhis entire sex, he had not one word to say in the way of accusation, but\r\nlay prostrate at my feet in sackcloth and ashes, wondering that he had\r\nnot taken my view of the case in starting.\r\n\r\nOnly twice in my life have I been accused of quoting without giving due\r\ncredit. The other case was that of Matilda Joslyn Gage. I had, on two or\r\nthree occasions, used a motto of hers in autograph books, just as I had\r\nsentiments from Longfellow, Lowell, Shakespeare, Moses, or Paul. In long\r\nlyceum trips innumerable autograph books met one at every turn, in the\r\ncars, depots, on the platform, at the hotel and in the omnibus. \"A\r\nsentiment, please,\" cry half a dozen voices. One writes hastily\r\ndifferent sentiments for each. In this way I unfortunately used a pet\r\nsentiment of Matilda's. So, here and now, I say to my autograph\r\nadmirers, from New York to San Francisco, whenever you see \"There is a\r\nword sweeter than Mother, Home, or Heaven--that word is Liberty,\"\r\nremember it belongs to Matilda Joslyn Gage. I hope, now, that Robert and\r\nMatilda will say, in their posthumous works, that I made the _amende\r\nhonorable_, as I always strive to do when friends feel they have not\r\nbeen fairly treated.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1881, the first volume of our History appeared; it was an\r\noctavo, containing 871 pages, with good paper, good print, handsome\r\nengravings, and nicely bound. I welcomed it with the same feeling of\r\nlove and tenderness as I did my firstborn. I took the same pleasure in\r\nhearing it praised and felt the same mortification in hearing it\r\ncriticised. The most hearty welcome it received was from Rev. William\r\nHenry Channing. He wrote us that it was as interesting and fascinating\r\nas a novel. He gave it a most flattering notice in one of the London\r\npapers. John W. Forney, too, wrote a good review and sent a friendly\r\nletter. Mayo W. Hazeltine, one of the ablest critics in this country, in\r\nthe New York _Sun_, also gave it a very careful and complimentary\r\nreview. In fact, we received far more praise and less blame than we\r\nanticipated. We began the second volume in June. In reading over the\r\nmaterial concerning woman's work in the War, I felt how little our\r\nlabors are appreciated. Who can sum up all the ills the women of a\r\nnation suffer from war? They have all of the misery and none of the\r\nglory; nothing to mitigate their weary waiting and watching for the\r\nloved ones who will return no more.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1881, to vary the monotony of the work on the history,\r\nwe decided to hold a series of conventions through the New England\r\nStates. We began during the Anniversary week in Boston, and had several\r\ncrowded, enthusiastic meetings in Tremont Temple. In addition to our\r\nsuffrage meetings, I spoke before the Free Religious, Moral Education,\r\nand Heredity associations. All our speakers stayed at the Parker House,\r\nand we had a very pleasant time visiting together in our leisure hours.\r\nWe were received by Governor Long, at the State House. He made a short\r\nspeech, in favor of woman suffrage, in reply to Mrs. Hooker. We also\r\ncalled on the Mayor, at the City Hall, and went through Jordan & Marsh's\r\ngreat mercantile establishment, where the clerks are chiefly young\r\ngirls, who are well fed and housed, and have pleasant rooms, with a good\r\nlibrary, where they sit and read in the evening. We went through the\r\nSherborn Reformatory Prison for Women, managed entirely by women. We\r\nfound it clean and comfortable, more like a pleasant home than a place\r\nof punishment.\r\n\r\nMrs. Robinson, Miss Anthony, and I were invited to dine with the Bird\r\nClub. No woman, other than I, had ever had that honor before. I dined\r\nwith them in 1870, escorted by \"Warrington\" of the Springfield\r\n_Republican_ and Edwin Morton. There I met Frank Sanborn for the first\r\ntime. Frank Bird held about the same place in political life in\r\nMassachusetts, that Thurlow Weed did in the State of New York for forty\r\nyears. In the evening we had a crowded reception at the home of Mrs.\r\nFenno Tudor, who occupied a fine old residence facing the Common, where\r\nwe met a large gathering of Boston reformers. On Decoration Day, May 30,\r\nwe went to Providence, where I was the guest of Dr. William F. Channing.\r\nWe had a very successful convention there. Senator Anthony and\r\nex-Governor Sprague were in the audience and expressed great pleasure,\r\nafterward, in all they had heard. I preached in Rev. Frederick\r\nHinckley's church the previous Sunday afternoon.\r\n\r\nFrom Providence I hurried home, to meet my son Theodore and his bride,\r\nwho had just landed from France. We decorated our house and grounds with\r\nChinese lanterns and national flags for their reception. As we had not\r\ntime to send to New York for bunting, our flags--French and\r\nAmerican--were all made of bright red and blue cambric. The effect was\r\nfine when they arrived; but, unfortunately, there came up a heavy\r\nthunderstorm in the night and so drenched our beautiful flags that they\r\nbecame colorless rags. My little maid announced to me early in the\r\nmorning that \"the French and Americans had had a great battle during the\r\nnight and that the piazza was covered with blood.\" This was startling\r\nnews to one just awakening from a sound sleep. \"Why, Emma!\" I said,\r\n\"what do you mean?\" \"Why,\" she replied, \"the rain has washed all the\r\ncolor out of our flags, and the piazza is covered with red and blue\r\nstreams of water.\" As the morning sun appeared in all its glory, chasing\r\nthe dark clouds away, our decorations did indeed look pale and limp, and\r\nwere promptly removed.\r\n\r\nI was happily surprised with my tall, stately daughter, Marguerite\r\nBerry. A fine-looking girl of twenty, straight, strong, and sound,\r\nmodest and pleasing. She can walk miles, sketches from nature with great\r\nskill and rapidity, and speaks three languages. I had always said to my\r\nsons: \"When you marry, choose a woman with a spine and sound teeth;\r\nremember the teeth show the condition of the bones in the rest of the\r\nbody.\" So, when Theodore introduced his wife to me, he said, \"You see I\r\nhave followed your advice; her spine is as straight as it should be, and\r\nevery tooth in her head as sound as ivory.\" This reminds me of a young\r\nman who used to put my stoves up for the winter. He told me one day that\r\nhe thought of getting married. \"Well,\" I said, \"above all things get a\r\nwife with a spine and sound teeth.\" Stove pipe in hand he turned to me\r\nwith a look of surprise, and said: \"Do they ever come without spines?\"\r\n\r\nIn July, 1881, sitting under the trees, Miss Anthony and I read and\r\ndiscussed Wendell Phillips' magnificent speech before the Phi Beta Kappa\r\nSociety at Harvard College. This society had often talked of inviting\r\nhim, but was afraid of his radical utterances. At last, hoping that\r\nyears might have modified his opinions and somewhat softened his speech,\r\nan invitation was given. The élite of Boston, the presidents and college\r\nprofessors from far and near, were there. A great audience of the wise,\r\nthe learned, the distinguished in State and Church assembled. Such a\r\nconservative audience, it was supposed, would surely hold this radical\r\nin check. Alas! they were all doomed, for once, to hear the naked truth,\r\non every vital question of the day. Thinking this might be his only\r\nopportunity to rouse some liberal thought in conservative minds, he\r\nstruck the keynote of every reform; defended labor strikes, the\r\nNihilists of Russia, prohibition, woman suffrage, and demanded\r\nreformation in our prisons, courts of justice, and halls of legislation.\r\nOn the woman question, he said:\r\n\r\n     \"Social science affirms that woman's place in society marks the\r\n     level of civilization. From its twilight in Greece, through the\r\n     Italian worship of the Virgin, the dreams of chivalry, the justice\r\n     of the civil law, and the equality of French society, we trace her\r\n     gradual recognition, while our common law, as Lord Brougham\r\n     confessed, was, with relation to women, the opprobrium of the age\r\n     of Christianity. For forty years earnest men and women, working\r\n     noiselessly, have washed away the opprobrium, the statute books of\r\n     thirty States have been remodeled, and woman stands, to-day, almost\r\n     face to face with her last claim--the ballot. It has been a weary\r\n     and thankless, though successful struggle. But if there be any\r\n     refuge from that ghastly curse, the vice of great cities, before\r\n     which social science stands palsied and dumb, it is in this more\r\n     equal recognition of women.\r\n\r\n     \"If, in this critical battle for universal suffrage, our fathers'\r\n     noblest legacy to us and the greatest trust God leaves in our\r\n     hands, there be any weapon, which, once taken from the armory, will\r\n     make victory certain, it will be as it has been in art, literature,\r\n     and society, summoning woman into the political arena. The literary\r\n     class, until within half a dozen years, has taken no note of this\r\n     great uprising; only to fling every obstacle in its way.\r\n\r\n     \"The first glimpse we get of Saxon blood in history is that line of\r\n     Tacitus in his 'Germany,' which reads, 'In all grave matters they\r\n     consult their women.' Years hence, when robust Saxon sense has\r\n     flung away Jewish superstition and Eastern prejudice, and put under\r\n     its foot fastidious scholarship and squeamish fashion, some second\r\n     Tacitus from the valley of the Mississippi will answer to him of\r\n     the Seven Hills: 'In all grave questions, we consult our women.'\r\n\r\n     \"If the Alps, piled in cold and silence, be the emblem of\r\n     despotism, we joyfully take the ever restless ocean for ours, only\r\n     pure because never still. To be as good as our fathers, we must be\r\n     better. They silenced their fears and subdued their prejudices,\r\n     inaugurating free speech and equality with no precedent on the\r\n     file. Let us rise to their level, crush appetite, and prohibit\r\n     temptation if it rots great cities; intrench labor in sufficient\r\n     bulwarks against that wealth which, without the tenfold strength of\r\n     modern incorporations, wrecked the Grecian and Roman states; and,\r\n     with a sterner effort still, summon woman into civil life, as\r\n     re-enforcement to our laboring ranks, in the effort to make our\r\n     civilization a success. Sit not like the figure on our silver coin,\r\n     looking ever backward.\r\n\r\n    \"'New occasions teach new duties,\r\n     Time makes ancient good uncouth,\r\n    They must upward still and onward,\r\n     Who would keep abreast of truth.\r\n    Lo! before us gleam her watch fires--\r\n     We ourselves must pilgrims be,\r\n    Launch our _Mayflower_, and steer boldly\r\n     Through the desperate winter sea,\r\n    Nor attempt the future's portal\r\n     With the past's blood-rusted key.'\"\r\n\r\nThat Harvard speech in the face of fashion, bigotry, and\r\nconservatism--so liberal, so eloquent, so brave--is a model for every\r\nyoung man, who, like the orator, would devote his talents to the best\r\ninterests of the race, rather than to his personal ambition for mere\r\nworldly success.\r\n\r\nToward the end of October, Miss Anthony returned, after a rest of two\r\nmonths, and we commenced work again on the second volume of the History.\r\nNovember 2 being election day, the Republican carriage, decorated with\r\nflags and evergreens, came to the door for voters. As I owned the house\r\nand paid the taxes, and as none of the white males was home, I suggested\r\nthat I might go down and do the voting, whereupon the gentlemen who\r\nrepresented the Republican committee urged me, most cordially, to do so.\r\nAccompanied by my faithful friend, Miss Anthony, we stepped into the\r\ncarriage and went to the poll, held in the hotel where I usually went to\r\npay taxes. When we entered the room it was crowded with men. I was\r\nintroduced to the inspectors by Charles Everett, one of our leading\r\ncitizens, who said: \"Mrs. Stanton is here, gentlemen, for the purpose of\r\nvoting. As she is a taxpayer, of sound mind, and of legal age, I see no\r\nreason why she should not exercise this right of citizenship.\"\r\n\r\nThe inspectors were thunderstruck. I think they were afraid that I was\r\nabout to capture the ballot box. One placed his arms round it, with one\r\nhand close over the aperture where the ballots were slipped in, and\r\nsaid, with mingled surprise and pity, \"Oh, no, madam! Men only are\r\nallowed to vote.\" I then explained to him that, in accordance with the\r\nConstitution of New Jersey, women had voted in New Jersey down to 1801,\r\nwhen they were forbidden the further exercise of the right by an\r\narbitrary act of the legislature, and, by a recent amendment to the\r\nnational Constitution, Congress had declared that \"all persons born or\r\nnaturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction\r\nthereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they\r\nreside\" and are entitled to vote. I told them that I wished to cast my\r\nvote, as a citizen of the United States, for the candidates for United\r\nStates offices. Two of the inspectors sat down and pulled their hats\r\nover their eyes, whether from shame or ignorance I do not know. The\r\nother held on to the box, and said \"I know nothing about the\r\nConstitutions, State or national. I never read either; but I do know\r\nthat in New Jersey, women have not voted in my day, and I cannot accept\r\nyour ballot.\" So I laid my ballot in his hand, saying that I had the\r\nsame right to vote that any man present had, and on him must rest the\r\nresponsibility of denying me my rights of citizenship.\r\n\r\nAll through the winter Miss Anthony and I worked diligently on the\r\nHistory. My daughter Harriot came from Europe in February, determined\r\nthat I should return with her, as she had not finished her studies. To\r\nexpedite my task on the History she seized the laboring oar, prepared\r\nthe last chapter and corrected the proof as opportunity offered. As the\r\nchildren were scattered to the four points of the compass and my husband\r\nspent the winter in the city, we decided to lease our house and all take\r\na holiday. We spent a month in New York city, busy on the History to the\r\nlast hour, with occasional intervals of receiving and visiting friends.\r\nAs I dreaded the voyage, the days flew by too fast for my pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nIN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving worked diligently through nearly two years on the second volume\r\nof \"The History of Woman Suffrage,\" I looked forward with pleasure to a\r\nrest, in the Old World, beyond the reach and sound of my beloved Susan\r\nand the woman suffrage movement. On May 27, 1892, I sailed with my\r\ndaughter Harriot on the _Château Léoville_ for Bordeaux. The many\r\nfriends who came to see us off brought fruits and flowers, boxes of\r\ncandied ginger to ward off seasickness, letters of introduction, and\r\nlight literature for the voyage. We had all the daily and weekly papers,\r\nsecular and religious, the new monthly magazines, and several novels. We\r\nthought we would do an immense amount of reading, but we did very\r\nlittle. Eating, sleeping, walking on deck, and watching the\r\never-changing ocean are about all that most people care to do. The sail\r\ndown the harbor that bright, warm evening was beautiful, and, we\r\nlingered on deck in the moonlight until a late hour.\r\n\r\nI slept but little, that night, as two cats kept running in and out of\r\nmy stateroom, and my berth was so narrow that I could only lie in one\r\nposition--as straight as if already in my coffin. Under such\r\ncircumstances I spent the night, thinking over everything that was\r\npainful in my whole life, and imagining all the different calamities\r\nthat might befall my family in my absence. It was a night of severe\r\nintrospection and intense dissatisfaction. I was glad when the morning\r\ndawned and I could go on deck. During the day my couch was widened one\r\nfoot, and, at night, the cats relegated to other quarters.\r\n\r\nWe had a smooth, pleasant, uneventful voyage, until the last night,\r\nwhen, on nearing the French coast, the weather became dark and stormy.\r\nThe next morning our good steamer pushed slowly and carefully up the\r\nbroad, muddy Gironde and landed us on the bustling quays of Bordeaux,\r\nwhere my son Theodore stood waiting to receive us. As we turned to say\r\nfarewell to our sturdy ship--gazing up at its black iron sides\r\nbesprinkled with salty foam--a feeling of deep thankfulness took\r\npossession of us, for she had been faithful to her trust, and had borne\r\nus safely from the New World to the Old, over thousands of miles of\r\ntreacherous sea.\r\n\r\nWe spent a day in driving about Bordeaux, enjoying the mere fact of\r\nrestoration to _terra firma_ after twelve days' imprisonment on the\r\nocean. Maritime cities are much the same all the world over. The forests\r\nof masts, the heavily laden drays, the lounging sailors, the rough\r\n'longshoremen, and the dirty quays, are no more characteristic of\r\nBordeaux than New York, London, and Liverpool. But Bordeaux was\r\ninteresting as the birthplace of Montesquieu and as the capital of\r\nancient Guienne and Gascony.\r\n\r\nBut I must not forget to mention an accident that happened on landing at\r\nBordeaux. We had innumerable pieces of baggage, a baby carriage, rocking\r\nchair, a box of \"The History of Woman Suffrage\" for foreign libraries,\r\nbesides the usual number of trunks and satchels, and one hamper, in\r\nwhich were many things we were undecided whether to take or leave. Into\r\nthis, a loaded pistol had been carelessly thrown. The hamper being\r\nhandled with an emphatic jerk by some jovial French sailor, the pistol\r\nexploded, shooting the bearer through the shoulder. He fell bleeding on\r\nthe quay. The dynamite scare being just at its height, the general\r\nconsternation was indescribable. Every Frenchman, with vehement\r\ngestures, was chattering to his utmost capacity, but keeping at a\r\nrespectful distance from the hamper. No one knew what had caused the\r\ntrouble; but Theodore was bound to make an investigation. He proceeded\r\nto untie the ropes and examine the contents, and there he found the\r\npistol, from which, pointing upward, he fired two other bullets. \"Alas!\"\r\nsaid Hattie, \"I put that pistol there, never dreaming it was loaded.\"\r\nThe wounded man was taken to the hospital. His injuries were very\r\nslight, but the incident cost us two thousand francs and no end of\r\nannoyance. I was thankful that by some chance the pistol had not gone\r\noff in the hold of the vessel and set the ship on fire, and possibly\r\nsacrificed three hundred lives through one girl's carelessness. Verily\r\nwe cannot be too careful in the use of firearms.\r\n\r\nBordeaux is a queer old town, with its innumerable soldiers and priests\r\nperambulating in all directions. The priests, in long black gowns and\r\nlarge black hats, have a solemn aspect; but the soldiers, walking lazily\r\nalong, or guarding buildings that seem in no danger from any living\r\nthing, are useless and ridiculous. The heavy carts and harness move the\r\nunaccustomed observer to constant pity for the horses. Besides\r\neverything that is necessary for locomotion, they have an endless number\r\nof ornaments, rising two or three feet above the horses' heads--horns,\r\nbells, feathers, and tassels. One of their carts would weigh as much as\r\nthree of ours, and all their carriages are equally heavy.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright, cool day on which we took the train for Toulouse, and\r\nwe enjoyed the delightful run through the very heart of old Gascony and\r\nLanguedoc. It was evident that we were in the South, where the sun is\r\nstrong, for, although summer had scarcely begun, the country already\r\nwore a brown hue. But the narrow strips of growing grain, the acres of\r\ngrape vines, looking like young currant bushes, and the fig trees\r\nscattered here and there, looked odd to the eye of a native of New York.\r\n\r\nWe passed many historical spots during that afternoon journey up the\r\nvalley of the Garonne. At Portets are the ruins of the Château of\r\nLangoiran, built before America was discovered, and, a few miles farther\r\non, we came to the region of the famous wines of Sauterne and\r\nChâteau-Yquem. Saint Macaire is a very ancient Gallo-Roman town, where\r\nthey show one churches, walls, and houses built fifteen centuries ago.\r\nOne of the largest towns has a history typical of this part of France,\r\nwhere wars of religion and conquest were once the order of the day. It\r\nwas taken and retaken by the Goths, Huns, Burgundians, and Saracens,\r\nnobody knows how many times, and belonged, successively, to the kings of\r\nFrance, to the dukes of Aquitaine, to the kings of England, and to the\r\ncounts of Toulouse. I sometimes wonder whether the inhabitants of our\r\nAmerican towns, whose growth and development have been free and\r\nuntrammeled as that of a favorite child, appreciate the blessings that\r\nhave been theirs. How true the lines of Goethe: \"America, thou art much\r\nhappier than our old continent; thou hast no castles in ruins, no\r\nfortresses; no useless remembrances, no vain enemies will interrupt the\r\ninward workings of thy life!\"\r\n\r\nWe passed through Moissac, with its celebrated organ, a gift of Mazarin;\r\nthrough Castle Sarrazin, founded by the Saracens in the eighth century;\r\nthrough Montauban, that stronghold of the early Protestants, which\r\nsuffered martyrdom for its religious faith; through Grisolles, built on\r\na Roman highway, and, at last, in the dusk of the evening, we reached\r\n\"the Capital of the South,\" that city of learning--curious, interesting\r\nold Toulouse.\r\n\r\nLaura Curtis Bullard, in her sketch of me in \"Our Famous Women,\" says:\r\n\"In 1882, Mrs. Stanton went to France, on a visit to her son Theodore,\r\nand spent three months at the convent of La Sagesse, in the city of\r\nToulouse.\" This is quite true; but I have sometimes tried to guess what\r\nher readers thought I was doing for three months in a convent. Weary of\r\nthe trials and tribulations of this world, had I gone there to prepare\r\nin solitude for the next? Had I taken the veil in my old age? Or, like\r\nhigh-church Anglicans and Roman Catholics, had I made this my retreat?\r\nNot at all. My daughter wished to study French advantageously, my son\r\nlived in the mountains hard by, and the garden of La Sagesse, with its\r\nbig trees, clean gravel paths, and cool shade, was the most delightful\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nIn this religious retreat I met, from time to time, some of the most\r\nradical and liberal-minded residents of the South. Toulouse is one of\r\nthe most important university centers of France, and bears with credit\r\nthe proud title of \"the learned city.\" With two distinguished members\r\nof the faculty, the late Dr. Nicholas Joly and Professor Moliner of the\r\nlaw school, I often had most interesting discussions on all the great\r\nquestions of the hour. That three heretics--I should say, six, for my\r\ndaughter, son, and his wife often joined the circle--could thus sit in\r\nperfect security, and debate, in the most unorthodox fashion, in these\r\nholy precincts, all the reforms, social, political, and religious, which\r\nthe United States and France need in order to be in harmony with the\r\nspirit of the age, was a striking proof of the progress the world has\r\nmade in freedom of speech. The time was when such acts would have cost\r\nus our lives, even if we had been caught expressing our heresies in the\r\nseclusion of our own homes. But here, under the oaks of a Catholic\r\nconvent, with the gray-robed sisters all around us, we could point out\r\nthe fallacies of Romanism itself, without fear or trembling. Glorious\r\nNineteenth Century, what conquests are thine!\r\n\r\nI shall say nothing of the picturesque streets of antique Toulouse;\r\nnothing of the priests, who swarm like children in an English town;\r\nnothing of the beautifully carved stone façades of the ancient mansions,\r\nonce inhabited by the nobility of Languedoc, but now given up to trade\r\nand commerce; nothing of the lofty brick cathedrals, whose exteriors\r\nremind one of London and whose interiors transfer you to \"the gorgeous\r\nEast\"; nothing of the Capitol, with its gallery rich in busts of the\r\ncelebrated sons of the South; nothing of the museum, the public garden,\r\nand the broad river winding through all. I must leave all these\r\ninteresting features of Toulouse and hasten up into the Black\r\nMountains, a few miles away, where I saw the country life of modern\r\nLanguedoc.\r\n\r\nAt Jacournassy, the country seat of Mme. Berry, whose daughter my son\r\nTheodore married, I spent a month full of surprises. How everything\r\ndiffered from America, and even from the plain below! The peasants, many\r\nof them at least, can neither speak French nor understand it. Their\r\nlanguage is a patois, resembling both Spanish and Italian, and they\r\ncling to it with astonishing pertinacity. Their agricultural implements\r\nare not less quaint than their speech. The plow is a long beam with a\r\nmost primitive share in the middle, a cow at one end, and a boy at the\r\nother. The grain is cut with a sickle and threshed with a flail on the\r\nbarn floor, as in Scripture times. Manure is scattered over the fields\r\nwith the hands. There was a certain pleasure in studying these old-time\r\nways. I caught glimpses of the anti-revolutionary epoch, when the king\r\nruled the state and the nobles held the lands. Here again I saw, as\r\nnever before, what vast strides the world has made within one century.\r\n\r\nBut, indoors, one returns to modern times. The table, beds, rooms of the\r\nchâteau were much the same as those of Toulouse and New York city. The\r\ncooking is not like ours, however, unless Delmonico's skill be supposed\r\nto have extended to all the homes in Manhattan Island, which is,\r\nunfortunately, not the case. What an admirable product of French genius\r\nis the art of cooking! Of incalculable value have been the culinary\r\nteachings of Vatel and his followers.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources of amusement, during my sojourn at Jacournassy, was\r\nof a literary nature. My son Theodore was then busy collecting the\r\nmaterials for his book entitled \"The Woman Question in Europe,\" and\r\nevery post brought in manuscripts and letters from all parts of the\r\ncontinent, written in almost every tongue known to Babel. So just what I\r\ncame abroad to avoid, I found on the very threshold where I came to\r\nrest. We had good linguists at the château, and every document finally\r\ncame forth in English dress, which, however, often needed much altering\r\nand polishing. This was my part of the work. So, away off in the heart\r\nof France, high up in the Black Mountains, surrounded with\r\nFrench-speaking relatives and patois-speaking peasants, I found myself\r\nonce more putting bad English into the best I could command, just as I\r\nhad so often done in America, when editor of _The Revolution_, or when\r\narranging manuscript for \"The History of Woman Suffrage.\" But it was\r\nlabor in the cause of my sex; it was aiding in the creation of \"The\r\nWoman Question in Europe,\" and so my pen did not grow slack nor my hand\r\nweary.\r\n\r\nThe scenery in the Black Mountains is very grand, and reminds one of the\r\nlofty ranges of mountains around the Yosemite Valley in California. In\r\nthe distance are the snow-capped Pyrenees, producing a solemn beauty, a\r\nprofound solitude. We used to go every evening where we could see the\r\nsun set and watch the changing shadows in the broad valley below.\r\nAnother great pleasure here was watching the gradual development of my\r\nfirst grandchild, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, born at Paris, on the 3d of\r\nMay, 1882. She was a fine child; though only three months old her head\r\nwas covered with dark hair, and her large blue eyes looked out with\r\nintense earnestness from beneath her well-shaped brow.\r\n\r\nOne night I had a terrible fright. I was the only person sleeping on\r\nthe ground floor of the château, and my room was at the extreme end of\r\nthe building, with the staircase on the other side. I had frequently\r\nbeen cautioned not to leave my windows open, as someone might get in.\r\nBut, as I always slept with an open window, winter and summer, I thought\r\nI would take the risk rather than endure a feeling of suffocation night\r\nafter night. The blinds were solid, and to close them was to exclude all\r\nthe air, so I left them open about a foot, braced by an iron hook. A\r\nfavorite resort for a pet donkey was under my window, where he had\r\nuniformly slept in profound silence. But one glorious moonlight night,\r\nprobably to arouse me to enjoy with him the exquisite beauty of our\r\nsurroundings, he put his nose through this aperture and gave one of the\r\nmost prolonged, resounding brays I ever heard. Startled from a deep\r\nsleep, I was so frightened that at first I could not move. My next\r\nimpulse was to rush out and arouse the family, but, seeing a dark head\r\nin the window, I thought I would slam down the heavy sash and check the\r\nintruder before starting. But just as I approached the window, another\r\nagonizing bray announced the innocent character of my midnight visitor.\r\nStretching out of the window to frighten him away, a gentleman in the\r\nroom above me, for the same purpose, dashed down a pail of water, which\r\nthe donkey and I shared equally. He ran off at a double-quick pace,\r\nwhile I made a hasty retreat.\r\n\r\nOn August 20, I returned to Toulouse and our quiet convent. The sisters\r\ngave me a most affectionate welcome and I had many pleasant chats,\r\nsitting in the gardens, with the priests and professors. Several times\r\nmy daughter and I attended High Mass in the cathedral, built in the\r\neleventh century. Being entirely new to us it was a most entertaining\r\nspectacular performance. With our American ideas of religious devotion,\r\nit seemed to us that the people, as well as the building, belonged to\r\nthe Dark Ages. About fifty priests, in mantles, gowns, and capes, some\r\nblack, some yellow,--with tinseled fringes and ornamentation,--with all\r\nmanner of gestures, genuflections, salutations, kneelings, and burning\r\nof incense; with prayers, admonitions, and sacraments, filled the altar\r\nwith constant motion.\r\n\r\nA tall man, dressed in red, wheeled in a large basket filled with bread,\r\nwhich the priests, with cups of wine, passed up and down among those\r\nkneeling at the altar. At least half a dozen times the places at the\r\naltar were filled--chiefly with women. We counted the men,--only\r\nseven,--and those were old and tremulous, with one foot in the grave.\r\nThe whole performance was hollow and mechanical. People walked in,\r\ncrossed themselves at the door with holy water, and, while kneeling and\r\nsaying their prayers, looked about examining the dress of each newcomer,\r\ntheir lips moving throughout, satisfied in reeling off the allotted\r\nnumber of prayers in a given time. The one redeeming feature in the\r\nwhole performance was the grand music. The deep-toned organ, whose\r\nsounds reverberated through the lofty arches, was very impressive.\r\n\r\nThe convent consisted of three large buildings, each three stories high,\r\nand a residence for the priests; also a chapel, where women, at their\r\ndevotions, might be seen at various hours from four o'clock in the\r\nmorning until evening. Inclosed within a high stone wall were beautiful\r\ngardens with fountains and shrines, where images of departed saints, in\r\nalcoves lighted with tapers were worshiped on certain days of the year.\r\n\r\nSuch were our environments, and our minds naturally often dwelt on the\r\nnature and power of the religion that had built up and maintained for\r\ncenturies these peaceful resorts, where cultivated, scholarly men, and\r\nwomen of fine sensibilities, could find rest from the struggles of the\r\noutside world. The sisters, who managed this large establishment, seemed\r\nhappy in the midst of their severe and multifarious duties. Of the\r\nundercurrent of their lives I could not judge, but on the surface all\r\nseemed smooth and satisfactory. They evidently took great pleasure in\r\nthe society of each other. Every evening, from six to eight, they all\r\nsat in the gardens in a circle together, sewing, knitting, and chatting,\r\nwith occasional merry bursts of laughter. Their existence is not, by\r\nmany degrees, as monotonous as that of most women in isolated\r\nhouseholds--especially of the farmer's wife in her solitary home, miles\r\naway from a village and a post office. They taught a school of fifty\r\norphan girls, who lived in the convent, and for whom they frequently had\r\nentertainments. They also had a few boarders of the old aristocracy of\r\nFrance, who hate the Republic and still cling to their belief in Popes\r\nand Kings. For the purpose of perfecting herself in the language, my\r\ndaughter embraced every opportunity to talk with all she met, and thus\r\nlearned the secrets of their inner life. As Sister Rose spoke English, I\r\ngleaned from her what knowledge I could as to their views of time and\r\neternity. I found their faith had not made much progress through the\r\nterrible upheavals of the French Revolution. Although the Jesuits have\r\nbeen driven out of France, and the pictures of Saints, the Virgin Mary,\r\nand Christ, have been banished from the walls of their schools and\r\ncolleges, the sincere Catholics are more devoted to their religion\r\nbecause of these very persecutions.\r\n\r\nTheodore, his wife, and baby, and Mr. Blatch, a young Englishman, came\r\nto visit us. The sisters and school children manifested great delight in\r\nthe baby, and the former equal pleasure in Mr. Blatch's marked attention\r\nto my daughter, as babies and courtships were unusual tableaux in a\r\nconvent. As my daughter was studying for a university degree in\r\nmathematics, I went with her to the Lycée, a dreary apartment in a\r\ngloomy old building with bare walls, bare floors, dilapidated desks and\r\nbenches, and an old rusty stove. Yet mid such surroundings, the\r\nprofessor always appeared in full dress, making a stately bow to his\r\nclass. I had heard so much of the universities of France that I had\r\npictured to myself grand buildings, like those of our universities; but,\r\ninstead, I found that the lectures were given in isolated rooms, here,\r\nthere, and anywhere--uniformly dreary inside and outside.\r\n\r\nThe first day we called on Professor Depesyrons. After making all our\r\narrangements for books and lectures, he suddenly turned to my daughter,\r\nand, pointing to the flounces on her dress, her jaunty hat, and some\r\nflowers in a buttonhole, he smiled, and said: \"All this, and yet you\r\nlove mathematics?\" As we entered the court, on our way to the Lycée and\r\ninquired for the professor's lecture room, the students in little groups\r\nwatched us closely. The one who escorted us asked several questions, and\r\ndiscovered, by our accent, that we were foreigners, a sufficient excuse\r\nfor the novelty of our proceeding. The professor received us most\r\ngraciously, and ordered the janitor to bring us chairs, table, paper,\r\nand pencils.\r\n\r\nThen we chatted pleasantly until the hour arrived for his lecture. As I\r\nhad but little interest in the subject, and as the problems were\r\npronounced in a foreign tongue, I took my afternoon nap. There was no\r\ndanger of affronting the professor by such indifference to his\r\neloquence, as he faced the blackboard, filling it with signs and figures\r\nas rapidly as possible; then expunging them to refill again and again,\r\nwithout a break in his explanations; talking as fast as his hand moved.\r\nHarriot struggled several days to follow him, but found it impossible,\r\nso we gave up the chase after cubes and squares, and she devoted herself\r\nwholly to the study of the language. These were days, for me, of perfect\r\nrest and peace. Everything moved as if by magic, no hurry and bustle,\r\nnever a cross or impatient word spoken. As only one or two of the\r\nsisters spoke English, I could read under the trees uninterruptedly for\r\nhours. Emerson, Ruskin, and Carlyle were my chosen companions.\r\n\r\nWe made several pleasant acquaintances among some Irish families who\r\nwere trying to live on their reduced incomes in Toulouse. One of these\r\ngave us a farewell ball. As several companies of the French army were\r\nstationed there, we met a large number of officers at the ball. I had\r\nalways supposed the French were graceful dancers. I was a quiet \"looker\r\non in Vienna,\" so I had an opportunity of comparing the skill of the\r\ndifferent nationalities. All admitted that none glided about so easily\r\nand gracefully as the Americans. They seemed to move without the least\r\neffort, while the English, the French, and the Germans labored in their\r\ndancing, bobbing up and down, jumping and jerking, out of breath and red\r\nin the face in five minutes. One great pleasure we had in Toulouse was\r\nthe music of the military band in the public gardens, where, for half a\r\ncent, we could have a chair and enjoy pure air and sweet music for two\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nWe gave a farewell dinner at the Tivollier Hotel to some of our friends.\r\nWith speeches and toasts we had a merry time. Professor Joly was the\r\nlife of the occasion. He had been a teacher in France for forty years\r\nand had just retired on a pension. I presented to him \"The History of\r\nWoman Suffrage,\" and he wrote a most complimentary review of it in one\r\nof the leading French journals. Every holiday must have its end. Other\r\nduties called me to England. So, after a hasty good-by to Jacournassy\r\nand La Sagesse, to the Black Mountains and Toulouse, to Languedoc and\r\nthe South, we took train one day in October, just as the first leaves\r\nbegan to fall, and, in fourteen hours, were at Paris. I had not seen the\r\nbeautiful French capital since 1840. My sojourn within its enchanting\r\nwalls was short,--too short,--and I woke one morning to find myself,\r\nafter an absence of forty-two years, again on the shores of England, and\r\nbefore my eyes were fairly open, grim old London welcomed me back. But\r\nthe many happy hours spent in \"merry England\" during the winter of\r\n1882-83 have not effaced from my memory the four months in Languedoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nREFORMS AND REFORMERS IN GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nReaching London in the fogs and mists of November, 1882, the first\r\nperson I met, after a separation of many years, was our revered and\r\nbeloved friend William Henry Channing. The tall, graceful form was\r\nsomewhat bent; the sweet, thoughtful face somewhat sadder; the crimes\r\nand miseries of the world seemed heavy on his heart. With his refined,\r\nnervous organization, the gloomy moral and physical atmosphere of London\r\nwas the last place on earth where that beautiful life should have ended.\r\nI found him in earnest conversation with my daughter and the young\r\nEnglishman she was soon to marry, advising them not only as to the\r\nimportance of the step they were about to take, but as to the minor\r\npoints to be observed in the ceremony. At the appointed time a few\r\nfriends gathered in Portland Street Chapel, and as we approached the\r\naltar our friend appeared in surplice and gown, his pale, spiritual face\r\nmore tender and beautiful than ever. This was the last marriage service\r\nhe ever performed, and it was as pathetic as original. His whole\r\nappearance was so in harmony with the exquisite sentiments he uttered,\r\nthat we who listened felt as if, for the time being, we had entered with\r\nhim into the Holy of Holies.\r\n\r\nSome time after, Miss Anthony and I called on him to return our thanks\r\nfor the very complimentary review he had written of \"The History of\r\nWoman Suffrage.\" He thanked us in turn for the many pleasant memories\r\nwe had revived in those pages, \"but,\" said he, \"they have filled me with\r\nindignation, too, at the repeated insults offered to women so earnestly\r\nengaged in honest endeavors for the uplifting of mankind. I blushed for\r\nmy sex more than once in reading these volumes.\" We lingered long,\r\ntalking over the events connected with our great struggle for freedom.\r\nHe dwelt with tenderness on our disappointments, and entered more fully\r\ninto the humiliations suffered by women, than any man we ever met. His\r\nviews were as appreciative of the humiliation of woman, through the\r\ndegradation of sex, as those expressed by John Stuart Mill in his\r\nwonderful work on \"The Subjection of Women.\" He was intensely interested\r\nin Frances Power Cobbe's efforts to suppress vivisection, and the last\r\ntime I saw him he was presiding at a parlor meeting where Dr. Elizabeth\r\nBlackwell gave an admirable address on the cause and cure of the social\r\nevil. Mr. Channing spoke beautifully in closing, paying a warm and\r\nmerited compliment to Dr. Blackwell's clear and concise review of all\r\nthe difficulties involved in the question.\r\n\r\nReading so much of English reformers in our journals, of the Brights,\r\nMcLarens, the Taylors; of Lydia Becker, Josephine Butler, and Octavia\r\nHill, and of their great demonstrations with lords and members of\r\nParliament in the chair,--we had longed to compare the actors in those\r\nscenes with our speakers on this side of the water. At last we met them\r\none and all in great public meetings and parlor reunions, at dinners and\r\nreceptions. We listened to their public men in Parliament, the courts,\r\nand the pulpit; to the women in their various assemblies; and came to\r\nthe conclusion that Americans surpass them in oratory and the conduct of\r\ntheir meetings. A hesitating, apologetic manner seems to be the national\r\ncustom for an exordium on all questions. Even their ablest men who have\r\nvisited this country, such as Kingsley, Stanley, Arnold, Tyndall, and\r\nColeridge, have all been criticised by the American public for their\r\nelocutionary defects. They have no speakers to compare with Wendell\r\nPhillips, George William Curtis, or Anna Dickinson, although John Bright\r\nis without peer among his countrymen, as is Mrs. Besant among the women.\r\nThe women, as a general rule, are more fluent than the men.\r\n\r\nI reached England in time to attend the great demonstration in Glasgow,\r\nto celebrate the extension of the municipal franchise to the women of\r\nScotland. It was a remarkable occasion. St. Andrew's immense hall was\r\npacked with women; a few men were admitted to the gallery at half a\r\ncrown apiece. Over five thousand people were present. When a Scotch\r\naudience is thoroughly roused, nothing can equal the enthusiasm. The\r\narrival of the speakers on the platform was announced with the wildest\r\napplause; the entire audience rising, waving their handkerchiefs, and\r\nclapping their hands, and every compliment paid the people of Scotland\r\nwas received with similar outbursts. Mrs. McLaren, a sister of John\r\nBright, presided, and made the opening speech. I had the honor, on this\r\noccasion, of addressing an audience for the first time in the Old World.\r\nMany others spoke briefly. There were too many speakers; no one had time\r\nto warm up to the point of eloquence.\r\n\r\nOur system of conventions, of two or three days' duration, with long\r\nspeeches discussing pointed and radical resolutions, is quite unknown in\r\nEngland. Their meetings consist of one session of a few hours, into\r\nwhich they crowd all the speakers they can summon. They have a few tame,\r\nprinted resolutions, on which there can be no possible difference of\r\nopinion, with the names of those who are to speak appended. Each of\r\nthese is read and a few short speeches are made, that may or may not\r\nhave the slightest reference to the resolutions, which are then passed.\r\nThe last is usually one of thanks to some lord or member of the House of\r\nCommons, who may have condescended to preside at the meeting or do\r\nsomething for the measure in Parliament. The Queen is referred to\r\ntenderly in most of the speeches, although she has never done anything\r\nto merit the approbation of the advocates of suffrage for women.\r\n\r\nFrom Glasgow quite a large party of the Brights and McLarens went to\r\nEdinburgh, where the Hon. Duncan McLaren gave us a warm welcome to\r\nNewington House, under the very shadow of the Salisbury crags. These and\r\nthe Pentland Hills are remarkable features in the landscape as you\r\napproach this beautiful city with its mountains and castles. We passed a\r\nfew charming days driving about, visiting old friends, and discussing\r\nthe status of woman on both sides of the Atlantic. Here we met Elizabeth\r\nPease Nichol and Jane and Eliza Wigham, whom I had not seen since we sat\r\ntogether in the World's Anti-slavery Convention, in London, in 1840. Yet\r\nI knew Mrs. Nichol at once; her strongly marked face was not readily\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nI went with the family on Sunday to the Friends' meeting, where a most\r\nunusual manifestation for that decorous sect occurred. I had been told\r\nthat, if I felt inclined, it would be considered quite proper for me to\r\nmake some remarks, and just as I was revolving an opening sentence to a\r\nfew thoughts I desired to present, a man arose in a remote part of the\r\nhouse and began, in a low voice, to give his testimony as to the truth\r\nthat was in him. All eyes were turned toward him, when suddenly a Friend\r\nleaned over the back of the seat, seized his coat tails and jerked him\r\ndown in a most emphatic manner. The poor man buried his face in his\r\nhands, and maintained a profound silence. I learned afterward that he\r\nwas a bore, and the Friend in the rear thought it wise to nip him in the\r\nbud. This scene put to flight all intentions of speaking on my part lest\r\nI, too, might get outside the prescribed limits and be suppressed by\r\nforce. I dined, that day, with Mrs. Nichol, at Huntly Lodge, where she\r\nhas entertained in turn many of our American reformers. Her walls have\r\nechoed to the voices of Garrison, Rogers, Samuel J. May, Parker\r\nPillsbury, Henry C. Wright, Douglass, Remond, and hosts of English\r\nphilanthropists. Though over eighty years of age, she was still awake to\r\nall questions of the hour, and generous in her hospitalities as of yore.\r\n\r\nMrs. Margaret Lucas, whose whole soul was in the temperance movement,\r\nescorted me from Edinburgh to Manchester, to be present at another great\r\ndemonstration in the Town Hall, the finest building in that district. It\r\nhad just been completed, and, with its ante-room, dining hall, and\r\nvarious apartments for social entertainments, was by far the most\r\nperfect hall I had seen in England. There I was entertained by Mrs.\r\nMatilda Roby, who, with her husband, gave me a most hospitable\r\nreception. She invited several friends to luncheon one day, among\r\nothers Miss Lydia Becker, editor of the _Suffrage Journal_ in that city,\r\nand the Rev. Mr. Steinthal, who had visited this country and spoken on\r\nour platform. The chief topic at the table was John Stuart Mill, his\r\nlife, character, writings, and his position with reference to the\r\npolitical rights of women. In the evening we went to see Ristori in\r\n'\"Queen Elizabeth.\" Having seen her, many years before, in America, I\r\nwas surprised to find her still so vigorous. And thus, week after week,\r\nsuffrage meetings, receptions, dinners, luncheons, and theaters\r\npleasantly alternated.\r\n\r\nThe following Sunday we heard in London a grand sermon from Moncure D.\r\nConway, and had a pleasant interview with him and Mrs. Conway at the\r\nclose of the session. Later we spent a few days at their artistic home,\r\nfilled with books, pictures, and mementos from loving friends. A\r\nbilliard room, with well-worn cues, balls, and table--quite a novel\r\nadjunct to a parsonage--may, in a measure, account for his vigorous\r\nsermons. A garden reception to Mr. and Mrs. Howells gave us an\r\nopportunity to see the American novelist surrounded by his English\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nSoon after this Mr. Conway asked me to fill his pulpit. I retired\r\nSaturday night, very nervous over my sermon for the next day, and the\r\nfeeling steadily increased until I reached the platform; but once there\r\nmy fears were all dissipated, and I never enjoyed speaking more than on\r\nthat occasion, for I had been so long oppressed with the degradation of\r\nwoman under canon law and church discipline, that I had a sense of\r\nrelief in pouring out my indignation. My theme was, \"What has\r\nChristianity done for Woman?\" and by the facts of history I showed\r\nclearly that to no form of religion was woman indebted for one impulse\r\nof freedom, as all alike have taught her inferiority and subjection. No\r\nlofty virtues can emanate from such a condition. Whatever heights of\r\ndignity and purity women have individually attained can in no way be\r\nattributed to the dogmas of their religion.\r\n\r\nWith my son Theodore, always deeply interested in my friends and public\r\nwork, I called, during my stay in London, on Mrs. Grey, Miss Jessie\r\nBoucherett, and Dr. Hoggan, who had written essays for \"The Woman\r\nQuestion in Europe\"; on our American minister (Mr. Lowell), Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGeorge W. Smalley, and many other notable men and women. By appointment\r\nwe had an hour with the Hon. John Bright, at his residence on\r\nPiccadilly. As his photograph, with his fame, had reached America, his\r\nfine face and head, as well as his political opinions, were quite\r\nfamiliar to us. He received us with great cordiality, and manifested a\r\nclear knowledge and deep interest in regard to all American affairs.\r\nFree trade and woman suffrage formed the basis of our conversation; the\r\nliterature of our respective countries and our great men and women were\r\nthe lighter topics of the occasion. He was not sound in regard to the\r\npolitical rights of women, but it is not given to any one man to be\r\nequally clear on all questions. He voted for John Stuart Mill's\r\namendment to the Household Suffrage Bill in 1867, but he said, \"that was\r\na personal favor to a friend, without any strong convictions as to the\r\nmerits of what I considered a purely sentimental measure.\"\r\n\r\nWe attended the meeting called to rejoice over the passage of the\r\nMarried Women's Property Bill, which gave to the women of England, in\r\n1882, what we had enjoyed in many States in this country since 1848.\r\nMrs. Jacob Bright, Mrs. Scatcherd, Mrs. Elmy, and several members of\r\nParliament made short speeches of congratulation to those who had been\r\ninstrumental in carrying the measure. It was generally conceded that to\r\nthe tact and persistence of Mrs. Jacob Bright, more than to any other\r\nperson, belonged the credit of that achievement. Jacob Bright was at the\r\ntime a member of Parliament, and fully in sympathy with the bill; and,\r\nwhile Mrs. Bright exerted all her social influence to make it popular\r\nwith the members, her husband, thoroughly versed in Parliamentary\r\ntactics, availed himself of every technicality to push the bill through\r\nthe House of Commons. Mrs. Bright's chief object in securing this bill,\r\naside from establishing the right that every human being has to his own\r\nproperty, was to place married women on an even plane with widows and\r\nspinsters, thereby making them qualified voters.\r\n\r\nThe next day we went out to Barn Elms to visit Mr. and Mrs. Charles\r\nMcLaren. He was a member of Parliament, a Quaker by birth and education,\r\nand had sustained, to his uttermost ability, the suffrage movement. His\r\ncharming wife, the daughter of Mrs. Pochin, is worthy of the noble\r\nmother who was among the earliest leaders on that question--speaking and\r\nwriting with ability, on all phases of the subject. Barn Elms is a grand\r\nold estate, a few miles out of London. It was the dairy farm of Queen\r\nElizabeth, and was presented by her to Sir Francis Walsingham. Since\r\nthen it has been inhabited by many persons of note. It has existed as an\r\nestate since the time of the early Saxon kings, and the record of the\r\nsale of Barn Elms in the time of King Athelstane is still extant. What\r\nwith its well-kept lawns, fine old trees, glimpses here and there of the\r\nThames winding round its borders, and its wealth of old associations, it\r\nis, indeed, a charming spot. Our memory of those days will not go back\r\nto Saxon kings, but remain with the liberal host and hostess, the\r\nbeautiful children, and the many charming acquaintances we met at that\r\nfireside. I doubt whether any of the ancient lords and ladies who\r\ndispensed their hospitalities under that roof did in any way surpass the\r\npresent occupants. Mrs. McLaren, interested in all the reforms of the\r\nday, is radical in her ideas, a brilliant talker, and, for one so young,\r\nremarkably well informed on all political questions.\r\n\r\nIt was at Barn Elms I met, for the first time, Mrs. Fannie Hertz, to\r\nwhom I was indebted for many pleasant acquaintances afterward. She is\r\nsaid to know more distinguished literary people than any other woman in\r\nLondon. I saw her, too, several times in her home; meeting, at her\r\nSunday-afternoon receptions, many persons I was desirous to know. On one\r\noccasion I found George Jacob Holyoake there, surrounded by several\r\nyoung ladies, all stoutly defending the Nihilists in Russia, and their\r\nright to plot their way to freedom. They counted a dynasty of Czars as\r\nnothing in the balance with the liberties of a whole people. As I joined\r\nthe circle, Mr. Holyoake called my attention to the fact that he was the\r\nonly one in favor of peaceful measures. \"Now,\" said he, \"I have often\r\nheard it said on your platform that the feminine element in politics\r\nwould bring about perpetual peace in government, and here all these\r\nladies are advocating: the worst forms of violence in the name of\r\nliberty.\" \"Ah!\" said I, \"lay on their shoulders the responsibility of\r\ngoverning, and they would soon become as mild and conservative as you\r\nseem to be.\" He then gave us his views on co-operation, the only remedy\r\nfor many existing evils, which he thought would be the next step toward\r\na higher civilization.\r\n\r\nThere, too, I met some Positivists, who, though liberal on religious\r\nquestions, were very narrow as to the sphere of woman. The difference in\r\nsex, which is the very reason why men and women should be associated in\r\nall forms of activity, is to them the strongest reason why they should\r\nbe separated. Mrs. Hertz belongs to the Harrison school of Positivists.\r\nI went with her to one of Mrs. Orr's receptions, where we met Robert\r\nBrowning, a fine-looking man of seventy years, with white hair and\r\nmustache. He was frank, easy, playful, and brilliant in conversation.\r\nMrs. Orr seemed to be taking a very pessimistic view of our present\r\nsphere of action, which Mr. Browning, with poetic coloring, was trying\r\nto paint more hopefully.\r\n\r\nThe next day I dined with Margaret Bright Lucas, in company with John P.\r\nThomasson, member of Parliament, and his wife, and, afterward, we went\r\nto the House of Commons and had the good fortune to hear Gladstone,\r\nParnell, and Sir Charles Dilke. Seeing Bradlaugh seated outside of the\r\ncharmed circle, I sent my card to him, and, in the corridor, we had a\r\nfew moments' conversation. I asked him if he thought he would eventually\r\nget his seat. He replied, \"Most assuredly I will. I shall open the next\r\ncampaign with such an agitation as will rouse our politicians to some\r\nconsideration of the changes gradually coming over the face of things\r\nin this country.\"\r\n\r\nThe place assigned ladies in the House of Commons is really a disgrace\r\nto a country ruled by a queen. This dark perch is the highest gallery,\r\nimmediately over the speaker's desk and government seats, behind a fine\r\nwire netting, so that it is quite impossible to see or hear anything.\r\nThe sixteen persons who can crowd into the front row, by standing with\r\ntheir noses partly through the open network, can have the satisfaction\r\nof seeing the cranial arch of their rulers and hearing an occasional\r\npaean to liberty, or an Irish growl at the lack of it. I was told that\r\nthis network was to prevent the members on the floor from being\r\ndisturbed by the beauty of the women. On hearing this I remarked that I\r\nwas devoutly thankful that our American men were not so easily\r\ndisturbed, and that the beauty of our women was not of so dangerous a\r\ntype. I could but contrast our spacious galleries in that magnificent\r\nCapitol at Washington, as well as in our grand State Capitols, where\r\nhundreds of women can sit at their ease and see and hear their rulers,\r\nwith these dark, dingy buildings. My son, who had a seat on the floor\r\njust opposite the ladies' gallery, said he could compare our appearance\r\nto nothing but birds in a cage. He could not distinguish an outline of\r\nanybody. All he could see was the moving of feathers and furs or some\r\nbright ribbon or flower.\r\n\r\nIn the libraries, the courts, and the House of Lords, I found many\r\nsuggestive subjects of thought. It was interesting to find, on the\r\nfrescoed walls, many historical scenes in which women had taken a\r\nprominent part. Among others there was Jane Lane assisting Charles II.\r\nto escape, and Alice Lisle concealing the fugitives after the battle of\r\nSedgemoor. Six wives of Henry VIII. stood forth, a solemn pageant when\r\none recalled their sad fate. Alas! whether for good or ill, women must\r\never fill a large space in the tragedies of the world.\r\n\r\nI passed a few pleasant hours in the house where Macaulay spent his last\r\nyears. The once spacious library and the large bow-window, looking out\r\non a beautiful lawn, where he sat, from day to day, writing his glowing\r\nperiods, possessed a peculiar charm for me, as the surroundings of\r\ngenius always do. I thought, as I stood there, how often he had\r\nunconsciously gazed on each object in searching for words rich enough to\r\ngild his ideas. The house was owned and occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Stephen\r\nWinckworth. It was at one of their sociable Sunday teas that many\r\npleasant memories of the great historian were revived.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable and genial women I met was Miss Frances Power\r\nCobbe. She called one afternoon, and sipped with me the five o'clock\r\ntea, a uniform practice in England. She was of medium height, stout,\r\nrosy, and vigorous-looking, with a large, well-shaped head, a strong,\r\nhappy face, and gifted with rare powers of conversation. I felt very\r\nstrongly attracted to her. She was frank and cordial, and pronounced in\r\nall her views. She gave us an account of her efforts to rescue unhappy\r\ncats and dogs from the hands of the vivisectionists. We saw her, too, in\r\nher home, and in her office in Victoria Street. The perfect order in\r\nwhich her books and papers were arranged, and the exquisite neatness of\r\nthe apartments, were refreshing to behold.\r\n\r\nMy daughter, having decided opinions of her own, was soon at\r\nloggerheads with Miss Cobbe on the question of vivisection. After we had\r\nexamined several German and French books, with illustrations showing the\r\nhorrible cruelty inflicted on cats and dogs, she enlarged on the\r\nhypocrisy and wickedness of these scientists, and, turning to my\r\ndaughter, said: \"Would you shake hands with one of these\r\nvivisectionists? Yes,\" said Harriot, \"I should be proud to shake hands\r\nwith Virchow, the great German scientist, for his kindness to a young\r\nAmerican girl. She applied to several professors to be admitted to their\r\nclasses, but all refused except Virchow; he readily assented, and\r\nrequested his students to treat her with becoming courtesy. 'If any of\r\nyou behave otherwise,' said he, 'I shall feel myself personally\r\ninsulted.' She entered his classes and pursued her studies, unmolested\r\nand with great success. Now, would you, Miss Cobbe, refuse to shake\r\nhands with any of your statesmen, scientists, clergymen, lawyers, or\r\nphysicians who treat women with constant indignities and insult?\" \"Oh,\r\nno!\" said Miss Cobbe. \"Then,\" said Harriot, \"you estimate the physical\r\nsuffering of cats and dogs as of more consequence than the humiliation\r\nof human beings. The man who tortures a cat for a scientific purpose is\r\nnot as low in the scale of beings, in my judgment, as one who sacrifices\r\nhis own daughter to some cruel custom.\"\r\n\r\nAs we were, just then, reading Froude's \"Life of Carlyle,\" we drove by\r\nthe house where Carlyle had lived, and paused a moment at the door where\r\npoor Jennie went in and out so often with a heavy heart. The book gives\r\na painful record of a great soul struggling with poverty and\r\ndisappointment; the hope of success, as an author, so long deferred and\r\nnever realized. His foolish pride of independence and headship, and his\r\nutter indifference to his domestic duties and the comfort of his wife\r\nmade the picture still darker. Poor Jennie! fitted to shine in any\r\ncircle, yet doomed, all her married life, to domestic drudgery, instead\r\nof associations with the great man for whose literary companionship she\r\nhad sacrificed everything.\r\n\r\nAt one of Miss Biggs' receptions Miss Anthony and I met Mr. Stansfeld,\r\nM.P., who had labored faithfully for the repeal of the Contagious\r\nDiseases Act, and had in a measure been successful. We had the honor of\r\nan interview with Lord Shaftesbury, at one of his crowded \"at homes,\"\r\nand found him a little uncertain as to the wisdom of allowing married\r\nwomen to vote, for fear of disturbing the peace of the family. I have\r\noften wondered if men see, in this objection, what a fatal admission\r\nthey make as to their love of domination.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was present at the great Liberal Conference, at Leeds, on\r\nOctober 17, 1882, to which Mrs. Helen Bright Clark, Miss Jane Cobden,\r\nMrs. Tanner, Mrs. Scatcherd, and several other ladies were duly elected\r\ndelegates from their respective Liberal Leagues. Mrs. Clark and Miss\r\nCobden, daughters of the great corn-law reformers, spoke eloquently in\r\nfavor of the resolution to extend Parliamentary suffrage to women, which\r\nwas presented by Walter McLaren of Bradford. As Mrs. Clark made her\r\nimpassioned appeal for the recognition of woman's political equality in\r\nthe next bill for extension of suffrage, that immense gathering of\r\nsixteen hundred delegates was hushed into profound silence. For a\r\ndaughter to speak thus in that great representative convention, in\r\nopposition to her loved and honored father, the acknowledged leader of\r\nthat party, was an act of heroism and fidelity to her own highest\r\nconvictions almost without a parallel in English history, and the effect\r\non the audience was as thrilling as it was surprising. The resolution\r\nwas passed by a large majority. At the reception given to John Bright\r\nthat evening, as Mrs. Clark approached the dais on which her noble\r\nfather stood shaking the hands of passing friends, she remarked to her\r\nhusband, \"I wonder if father has heard of my speech this morning, and if\r\nhe will forgive me for thus publicly differing with him?\" The query was\r\nsoon answered. As he caught the first glimpse of his daughter he stepped\r\ndown, and, pressing her hand affectionately, kissed her on either cheek.\r\n\r\nThe next evening the great Quaker statesman was heard by the admiring\r\nthousands who could crowd into Victoria Hall, while thousands, equally\r\ndesirous to hear, failed to get tickets of admission. It was a\r\nmagnificent sight, and altogether a most impressive gathering of the\r\npeople. Miss Anthony, with her friends, sat in the gallery opposite the\r\ngreat platform, where they had a fine view of the whole audience. When\r\nJohn Bright, escorted by Sir Wilfrid Lawson, took his seat, the immense\r\ncrowd rose, waving hats and handkerchiefs, and, with the wildest\r\nenthusiasm, gave cheer after cheer in honor of the great leader. Sir\r\nWilfrid Lawson, in his introductory remarks, facetiously alluded to the\r\nresolution adopted by the Conference as somewhat in advance of the ideas\r\nof the speaker of the evening. The house broke into roars of laughter,\r\nwhile the Father of Liberalism, perfectly convulsed, joined in the\r\ngeneral merriment.\r\n\r\nBut when at length his time to speak had come, and Mr. Bright went over\r\nthe many steps of progress that had been taken by the Liberal party, he\r\ncunningly dodged the question of the emancipation of the women of\r\nEngland. He skipped round the agitation of 1867, and John Stuart Mill's\r\namendment presented at that time in the House of Commons; the extension\r\nof the municipal suffrage in 1869; the participation of women in the\r\nestablishment of national schools under the law of 1870, both as voters\r\nand members of school boards; the Married Women's Property Bill of 1882;\r\nthe large and increasing vote for the extension of Parliamentary\r\nsuffrage in the House of Commons, and the adoption of the resolution by\r\nthat great Conference the day before. All these successive steps toward\r\nwoman's emancipation he carefully remembered to forget.\r\n\r\nWhile in London Miss Anthony and I attended several enthusiastic reform\r\nmeetings. We heard Bradlaugh address his constituency on that memorable\r\nday at Trafalgar Square, at the opening of Parliament, when violence was\r\nanticipated and the Parliament Houses were surrounded by immense crowds,\r\nwith the military and police in large numbers, to maintain order. We\r\nheard Michael Davitt and Miss Helen Taylor at a great meeting in Exeter\r\nHall; the former on home rule for Ireland, and the latter on the\r\nnationalization of land. The facts and figures given in these two\r\nlectures, as to the abject poverty of the people and the cruel system by\r\nwhich every inch of land had been grabbed by their oppressors, were\r\nindeed appalling. A few days before sailing we made our last visit to\r\nErnestine L. Rose, and found our noble coadjutor, though in delicate\r\nhealth, pleasantly situated in the heart of London, as deeply interested\r\nas ever in the struggles of the hour.\r\n\r\nA great discomfort, in all English homes, is the inadequate system of\r\nheating. A moderate fire in the grate is the only mode of heating, and\r\nthey seem quite oblivious to the danger of throwing a door open into a\r\ncold hall at one's back, while the servants pass in and out with the\r\nvarious courses at dinner. As we Americans were sorely tried, under such\r\ncircumstances, it was decided, in the home of my son-in-law, Mr. Blatch,\r\nto have a hall-stove, which, after a prolonged search, was found in\r\nLondon and duly installed as a presiding deity to defy the dampness that\r\npervades all those ivy-covered habitations, as well as the neuralgia\r\nthat wrings their possessors. What a blessing it proved, more than any\r\none thing making the old English house seem like an American home! The\r\ndelightful summer heat we, in America, enjoy in the coldest seasons, is\r\nquite unknown to our Saxon cousins. Although many came to see our stove\r\nin full working order, yet we could not persuade them to adopt the\r\nAmerican system of heating the whole house at an even temperature. They\r\ncling to the customs of their fathers with an obstinacy that is\r\nincomprehensible to us, who are always ready to try experiments.\r\nAmericans complain bitterly of the same freezing experiences in France\r\nand Germany, and, in turn, foreigners all criticise our overheated\r\nhouses and places of amusement.\r\n\r\nWhile attending a meeting in Birmingham I stayed with a relative of\r\nJoseph Sturge, whose home I had visited forty years before. The meeting\r\nwas called to discuss the degradation of women under the Contagious\r\nDiseases Act. Led by Josephine Butler, the women of England were deeply\r\nstirred on the question of its repeal and have since secured it. I heard\r\nMrs. Butler speak in many of her society meetings as well as on other\r\noccasions. Her style was not unlike that one hears in Methodist camp\r\nmeetings from the best cultivated of that sect; her power lies in her\r\ndeeply religious enthusiasm. In London we met Emily Faithful, who had\r\njust returned from a lecturing tour in the United States, and were much\r\namused with her experiences. Having taken prolonged trips over the whole\r\ncountry, from Maine to Texas, for many successive years, Miss Anthony\r\nand I could easily add the superlative to all her narrations.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant surprise to meet the large number of Americans usually\r\nat the receptions of Mrs. Peter Taylor. Graceful and beautiful, in full\r\ndress, standing beside her husband, who evidently idolized her, Mrs.\r\nTaylor appeared quite as refined in her drawing room as if she had never\r\nbeen exposed to the public gaze while presiding over a suffrage\r\nconvention. Mrs. Taylor is called the mother of the suffrage movement.\r\nThe reform has not been carried on in all respects to her taste, nor on\r\nwhat she considers the basis of high principle. Neither she nor Mrs.\r\nJacob Bright has ever been satisfied with the bill asking the rights of\r\nsuffrage for \"widows and spinsters\" only. To have asked this right \"for\r\nall women duly qualified,\" as but few married women are qualified\r\nthrough possessing property in their own right, would have been\r\nsubstantially the same, without making any invidious distinctions. Mrs.\r\nTaylor and Mrs. Bright felt that, as married women were the greatest\r\nsufferers under the law, they should be the first rather than the last\r\nto be enfranchised. The others, led by Miss Becker, claimed that it was\r\ngood policy to make the demand for \"spinsters and widows,\" and thus\r\nexclude the \"family unit\" and \"man's headship\" from the discussion; and\r\nyet these were the very points on which the objections were invariably\r\nbased. They claimed that, if \"spinsters and widows\" were enfranchised,\r\nthey would be an added power to secure to married women their rights.\r\nBut the history of the past gives us no such assurance. It is not\r\ncertain that women would be more just than men, and a small privileged\r\nclass of aristocrats have long governed their fellow-countrymen. The\r\nfact that the spinsters in the movement advocated such a bill, shows\r\nthat they were not to be trusted in extending it. John Stuart Mill, too,\r\nwas always opposed to the exclusion of married women in the demand for\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nMy sense of justice was severely tried by all I heard of the\r\npersecutions of Mrs. Besant and Mr. Bradlaugh for their publications on\r\nthe right and duty of parents to limit population. Who can contemplate\r\nthe sad condition of multitudes of young children in the Old World whose\r\nfate is to be brought up in ignorance and vice--a swarming, seething\r\nmass which nobody owns--without seeing the need of free discussion of\r\nthe philosophical principles that underlie these tangled social\r\nproblems? The trials of Foote and Ramsey, too, for blasphemy, seemed\r\nunworthy a great nation in the nineteenth century. Think of\r\nwell-educated men of good moral standing thrown into prison in solitary\r\nconfinement, for speaking lightly of the Hebrew idea of Jehovah and the\r\nNew Testament account of the birth of Jesus! Our Protestant clergy never\r\nhesitate to make the dogmas and superstitions of the Catholic Church\r\nseem as absurd as possible, and why should not those who imagine they\r\nhave outgrown Protestant superstitions make them equally ridiculous?\r\nWhatever is true can stand investigation and ridicule.\r\n\r\nIn the last of April, when the wildflowers were in their glory, Mrs.\r\nMellen and her lovely daughter, Daisy, came down to our home at\r\nBasingstoke to enjoy its beauty. As Mrs. Mellen had known Charles\r\nKingsley and entertained him at her residence in Colorado, she felt a\r\ndesire to see his former home. Accordingly, one bright morning, Mr.\r\nBlatch drove us to Eversley, through Strathfieldsaye, the park of the\r\nDuke of Wellington. This magnificent place was given to him by the\r\nEnglish government after the battle of Waterloo. A lofty statue of the\r\nduke, that can be seen for miles around, stands at one entrance. A drive\r\nof a few miles further brought us to the parish church of Canon\r\nKingsley, where he preached many years, and where all that is mortal of\r\nhim now lies buried. We wandered through the old church, among the\r\nmoss-covered tombstones, and into the once happy home, now silent and\r\ndeserted--his loved ones being scattered in different quarters of the\r\nglobe. Standing near the last resting place of the author of \"Hypatia,\"\r\nhis warning words for women, in a letter to John Stuart Mill, seemed\r\nlike a voice from heaven saying, with new inspiration and power, \"This\r\nwill never be a good world for women until the last remnant of the canon\r\nlaw is civilized off the face of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nWe heard Mr. Fawcett speak to his Hackney constituents at one of his\r\ncampaign meetings. In the course of his remarks he mentioned with\r\nevident favor, as one of the coming measures, the disestablishment of\r\nthe Church, and was greeted with loud applause. Soon after he spoke of\r\nwoman suffrage as another question demanding consideration, but this\r\nwas received with laughter and jeers, although the platform was crowded\r\nwith advocates of the measure, among whom were the wife of the speaker\r\nand her sister, Dr. Garrett Anderson. The audience were evidently in\r\nfavor of releasing themselves from being taxed to support the Church,\r\nforgetting that women were taxed not only to support a Church but also a\r\nState in the management of neither of which they had a voice. Mr.\r\nFawcett was not an orator, but a simple, straightforward speaker. He\r\nmade one gesture, striking his right clenched fist into the palm of his\r\nleft hand at the close of all his strongest assertions, and, although\r\nmore liberal than his party, he was a great favorite with his\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nOne pleasant trip I made in England was to Bristol, to visit the Misses\r\nPriestman and Mrs. Tanner, sisters-in-law of John Bright. I had stayed\r\nat their father's house forty years before, so we felt like old friends.\r\nI found them all liberal women, and we enjoyed a few days together,\r\ntalking over our mutual struggles, and admiring the beautiful scenery\r\nfor which that part of the country is celebrated. The women of England\r\nwere just then organizing political clubs, and I was invited to speak\r\nbefore many of them. There is an earnestness of purpose among English\r\nwomen that is very encouraging under the prolonged disappointments\r\nreformers inevitably suffer. And the order of English homes, too, among\r\nthe wealthy classes, is very enjoyable. All go on from year to year with\r\nthe same servants, the same surroundings, no changes, no moving, no\r\nbuilding even; in delightful contrast with our periodical upheavals,\r\nalways uncertain where we shall go next, or how long our main\r\ndependents will stand by us.\r\n\r\nFrom Bristol I went to Greenbank to visit Mrs. Helen Bright Clark. One\r\nevening her parlors were crowded and I was asked to give an account of\r\nthe suffrage movement in America. Some clergymen questioned me in regard\r\nto the Bible position of woman, whereupon I gave quite an exposition of\r\nits general principles in favor of liberty and equality. As two distinct\r\nlines of argument can be woven out of those pages on any subject, on\r\nthis occasion I selected all the most favorable texts for justice to\r\nwoman, and closed by stating the limits of its authority. Mrs. Clark,\r\nthough thoroughly in sympathy with the views I had expressed, feared\r\nlest my very liberal utterances might have shocked some of the strictest\r\nof the laymen and clergy. \"Well,\" said I, \"if we who do see the\r\nabsurdities of the old superstitions never unveil them to others, how is\r\nthe world to make any progress in the theologies? I am in the sunset of\r\nlife, and I feel it to be my special mission to tell people what they\r\nare not prepared to hear, instead of echoing worn-out opinions.\" The\r\nresult showed the wisdom of my speaking out of my own soul. To the\r\nsurprise of Mrs. Clark, the Primitive Methodist clergyman called on\r\nSunday morning to invite me to occupy his pulpit in the afternoon and\r\npresent the same line of thought I had the previous evening. I accepted\r\nhis invitation. He led the services, and I took my text from Genesis i.\r\n27, 28, showing that man and woman were a simultaneous creation,\r\nendowed, in the beginning, with equal power.\r\n\r\nReturning to London, I accepted an invitation to take tea one afternoon\r\nwith Mrs. Jacob Bright, who, in earnest conversation, had helped us\r\neach to a cup of tea, and was turning to help us to something more, when\r\nover went table and all--tea, bread and butter, cake, strawberries and\r\ncream, silver, china, in one conglomerate mass. Silence reigned. No one\r\nstarted; no one said \"Oh!\" Mrs. Bright went on with what she was saying\r\nas if nothing unusual had occurred, rang the bell, and, when the servant\r\nappeared, pointing to the débris, she said, \"Charles, remove this.\" I\r\nwas filled with admiration at her coolness, and devoutly thankful that\r\nwe Americans maintained an equally dignified silence.\r\n\r\nAt a grand reception, given in our honor by the National Central\r\nCommittee, in Princess' Hall, Jacob Bright, M.P., presided and made an\r\nadmirable opening speech, followed by his sister, Mrs. McLaren, with a\r\nhighly complimentary address of welcome. By particular request Miss\r\nAnthony explained the industrial, legal, and political status of\r\nAmerican women, while I set forth their educational, social, and\r\nreligious condition. John P. Thomasson, M.P., made the closing address,\r\nexpressing his satisfaction with our addresses and the progress made in\r\nboth countries.\r\n\r\nMrs. Thomasson, daughter of Mrs. Lucas, gave several parties,\r\nreceptions, and dinners,--some for ladies only,--where an abundant\r\nopportunity was offered for a critical analysis of the idiosyncrasies of\r\nthe superior sex, especially in their dealings with women. The patience\r\nof even such heroic souls as Lydia Becker and Caroline Biggs was almost\r\nexhausted with the tergiversations of Members of the House of Commons.\r\nAlas for the many fair promises broken, the hopes deferred, the votes\r\nfully relied on and counted, all missing in the hour of action! One\r\ncrack of Mr. Gladstone's whip put a hundred Liberal members to\r\nflight--members whom these noble women had spent years in educating. I\r\nnever visited the House of Commons that I did not see Miss Becker and\r\nMiss Biggs trying to elucidate the fundamental principles of just\r\ngovernment to some of the legislators. Verily their divine faith and\r\npatience merited more worthy action on the part of their alleged\r\nrepresentatives!\r\n\r\nMiss Henrietta Müller gave a farewell reception to Miss Anthony and me\r\non the eve of our departure for America, when we had the opportunity of\r\nmeeting once more most of the pleasant acquaintances we had made in\r\nLondon. Although it was announced for the afternoon, we did, in fact,\r\nreceive all day, as many could not come at the hour appointed. Dr.\r\nElizabeth Blackwell took breakfast with us; Mrs. Fawcett, Mrs. Saville,\r\nand Miss Lord were with us at luncheon; Harriet Hosmer and Olive Logan\r\nsoon after; Mrs. Peter Taylor later, and from three to six o'clock the\r\nparlors were crowded.\r\n\r\nReturning from London I passed my birthday, November 12, 1883, in\r\nBasingstoke. It was a sad day for us all, knowing that it was the last\r\nday with my loved ones before my departure for America. When I imprinted\r\nthe farewell kiss on the soft cheek of my little granddaughter Nora in\r\nthe cradle, she in the dawn and I in the sunset of life, I realized how\r\nwidely the broad ocean would separate us. Miss Anthony, met me at\r\nAlderly Edge, where we spent a few days with Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Bright.\r\nThere we found their noble sisters, Mrs. McLaren and Mrs. Lucas, young\r\nWalter McLaren and his lovely bride, Eva Müller, whom we had heard\r\nseveral times on the suffrage platform. We rallied her on the step she\r\nhad lately taken, notwithstanding her sister's able paper on the\r\nblessedness of a single life. While there, we visited Dean Stanley's\r\nbirthplace, but on his death the light and joy went out. The old church\r\nwhose walls had once echoed to his voice, and the house where he had\r\nspent so many useful years, seemed sad and deserted. But the day was\r\nbright and warm, the scenery beautiful, cows and sheep were still\r\ngrazing in the meadows, and the grass was as green as in June. This is\r\nEngland's chief charm,--it is forever green,--perhaps in compensation\r\nfor the many cloudy days.\r\n\r\nAs our good friends Mrs. McLaren and Mrs. Lucas had determined to see us\r\nsafely on board the Servia, they escorted us to Liverpool, where we met\r\nMrs. Margaret Parker and Mrs. Scatcherd. Another reception was given us\r\nat the residence of Dr. Ewing Whittle. Several short speeches were made,\r\nand all present cheered the parting guests with words of hope and\r\nencouragement for the good cause. Here the wisdom of forming an\r\ninternational association was first considered. The proposition met with\r\nsuch favor from those present that a committee was appointed to\r\ncorrespond with the friends in different nations. Miss Anthony and I\r\nwere placed on the committee, and while this project has not yet been\r\nfully carried out, the idea of the intellectual co-operation of women to\r\nsecure equal rights and opportunities for their sex was the basis of the\r\nInternational Council of Women, which was held under the auspices of the\r\nNational Woman Suffrage Association in Washington, D. C, in March, 1888.\r\n\r\nOn the Atlantic for ten days we had many opportunities to review all we\r\nhad seen and heard. Sitting on deck, hour after hour, how often I\r\nqueried with myself as to the significance of the boon for which we were\r\nso earnestly struggling. In asking for a voice in the government under\r\nwhich we live, have we been pursuing a shadow for fifty years? In\r\nseeking political power, are we abdicating that social throne where they\r\ntell us our influence is unbounded? No, no! the right of suffrage is no\r\nshadow, but a substantial entity that the citizen can seize and hold for\r\nhis own protection and his country's welfare. A direct power over one's\r\nown person and property, an individual opinion to be counted, on all\r\nquestions of public interest, are better than indirect influence, be\r\nthat ever so far reaching.\r\n\r\nThough influence, like the pure white light, is all-pervading, yet it is\r\nofttimes obscured with passing clouds and nights of darkness. Like the\r\nsun's rays, it may be healthy, genial, inspiring, though sometimes too\r\ndirect for comfort, too oblique for warmth, too scattered for any\r\npurpose. But as the prism divides the rays, revealing the brilliant\r\ncolors of the light, so does individual sovereignty reveal the beauty of\r\nrepresentative government, and as the burning-glass shows the power of\r\nconcentrating the rays, so does the combined power of the multitude\r\nreveal the beauty of united effort to carry a grand measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nWOMAN AND THEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning from Europe in the autumn of 1883, after visiting a large\r\ncircle of relatives and friends, I spent six weeks with my cousin,\r\nElizabeth Smith Miller, at her home at Geneva, on Seneca Lake.\r\n\r\nThrough Miss Frances Lord, a woman of rare culture and research, my\r\ndaughter and I had become interested in the school of theosophy, and\r\nread \"Isis Unveiled,\" by Madame Blavatsky, Sinnett's works on the\r\n\"Occult World,\" and \"The Perfect Way,\" by Anna Kingsford. Full of these\r\nideas, I soon interested my cousins in the subject, and we resolved to\r\nexplore, as far as possible, some of these Eastern mysteries, of which\r\nwe had heard so much. We looked in all directions to find some pilot to\r\nstart us on the right course. We heard that Gerald Massey was in New\r\nYork city, lecturing on \"The Devil,\" \"Ghosts,\" and \"Evil Spirits\"\r\ngenerally, so we invited him to visit us and give a course of lectures\r\nin Geneva. But, unfortunately, he was ill, and could not open new fields\r\nof thought to us at that time, though we were very desirous to get a\r\nglimpse into the unknown world, and hold converse with the immortals. As\r\nI soon left Geneva with my daughter, Mrs. Stanton Lawrence, our occult\r\nstudies were, for a time, abandoned.\r\n\r\nMy daughter and I often talked of writing a story, she describing the\r\ncharacters and their environments and I attending to the philosophy and\r\nsoliloquies. As I had no special duties in prospect, we decided that\r\nthis was the time to make our experiment. Accordingly we hastened to the\r\nfamily homestead at Johnstown, New York, where we could be entirely\r\nalone. Friends on all sides wondered what had brought us there in the\r\ndepth of the winter. But we kept our secret, and set ourselves to work\r\nwith diligence, and after three months our story was finished to our\r\nentire satisfaction. We felt sure that everyone who read it would be\r\ndeeply interested and that we should readily find a publisher. We\r\nthought of \"Our Romance\" the first thing in the morning and talked of it\r\nthe last thing at night. But alas! friendly critics who read our story\r\npointed out its defects, and in due time we reached their conclusions,\r\nand the unpublished manuscript now rests in a pigeonhole of my desk. We\r\nhad not many days to mourn our disappointment, as Madge was summoned to\r\nher Western home, and Miss Anthony arrived armed and equipped with\r\nbushels of documents for vol. III. of \"The History of Woman Suffrage.\"\r\nThe summer and autumn of 1884 Miss Anthony and I passed at Johnstown,\r\nworking diligently on the History, indulging only in an occasional\r\ndrive, a stroll round the town in the evening, or a ride in the open\r\nstreet cars.\r\n\r\nMrs. Devereux Blake was holding a series of conventions, at this time,\r\nthrough the State of New York, and we urged her to expend some of her\r\nmissionary efforts in my native town, which she did with good results.\r\nAs the school election was near at hand Miss Anthony and I had several\r\npreliminary meetings to arouse the women to their duty as voters, and to\r\nthe necessity of nominating some woman for trustee. When the day for\r\nthe election arrived the large upper room of the Academy was filled with\r\nladies and gentlemen. Some timid souls who should have been there stayed\r\nat home, fearing there would be a row, but everything was conducted with\r\ndecency and in order. The chairman, Mr. Rosa, welcomed the ladies to\r\ntheir new duties in a very complimentary manner. Donald McMartin stated\r\nthe law as to what persons were eligible to vote in school elections.\r\nMrs. Horace Smith filled the office of teller on the occasion with\r\npromptness and dignity, and Mrs. Elizabeth Wallace Yost was elected\r\ntrustee by a majority of seven. It is strange that intelligent women,\r\nwho are supposed to feel some interest in the question of education,\r\nshould be so indifferent to the power they possess to make our schools\r\nall that they should be.\r\n\r\nThis was the year of the presidential campaign. The Republicans and\r\nDemocrats had each held their nominating conventions, and all classes\r\nparticipated in the general excitement. There being great\r\ndissatisfaction in the Republican ranks, we issued a manifesto: \"Stand\r\nby the Republican Party,\" not that we loved Blaine more, but Cleveland\r\nless. The latter was elected, therefore it was evident that our efforts\r\ndid not have much influence in turning the tide of national politics,\r\nthough the Republican papers gave a broad circulation to our appeal.\r\nDowden's description of the poet Shelley's efforts in scattering one of\r\nhis suppressed pamphlets, reminded me of ours. He purchased bushels of\r\nempty bottles, in which he placed his pamphlets; having corked them up\r\ntight, he threw the bottles into the sea at various fashionable watering\r\nplaces, hoping they would wash ashore. Walking the streets of London in\r\nthe evening he would slip his pamphlets into the hoods of old ladies'\r\ncloaks, throw them in shop doors, and leave them in cabs and omnibuses.\r\nWe scattered ours in the cars, inclosed them in every letter we wrote or\r\nnewspaper we sent through the country.\r\n\r\nThe night before election Mr. Stanton and Professor Horace Smith spoke\r\nin the Johnstown courthouse, and took rather pessimistic views of the\r\nfuture of the Republic should James G. Blaine be defeated. Cleveland was\r\nelected, and we still live as a nation, and are able to digest the\r\nthousands of foreign immigrants daily landing at our shores. The night\r\nof the election a large party of us sat up until two o'clock to hear the\r\nnews. Mr. Stanton had long been one of the editorial writers on the New\r\nYork Sun, and they sent him telegrams from that office until a late\r\nhour. However, the election was so close that we were kept in suspense\r\nseveral days, before it was definitely decided.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony left in December, 1884, for Washington, and I went to work\r\non an article for the North American Review, entitled, \"What has\r\nChristianity done for Women?\" I took the ground that woman was not\r\nindebted to any form of religion for the liberty she now enjoys, but\r\nthat, on the contrary, the religious element in her nature had always\r\nbeen perverted for her complete subjection. Bishop Spaulding, in the\r\nsame issue of the Review, took the opposite ground, but I did not feel\r\nthat he answered my points.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1885, my niece Mrs. Baldwin and I went to Washington to\r\nattend the Annual Convention of the National Woman Suffrage Association.\r\nIt was held in the Unitarian church on the 20th, 21st, and 22d days of\r\nthat month, and went off with great success, as did the usual reception\r\ngiven by Mrs. Spofford at the Riggs House. This dear friend, one of our\r\nmost ardent coadjutors, always made the annual convention a time for\r\nmany social enjoyments. The main feature in this convention was the\r\nattempt to pass the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas, The dogmas incorporated in religious creeds derived from\r\n     Judaism, teaching that woman was an after-thought in the creation,\r\n     her sex a misfortune, marriage a condition of subordination, and\r\n     maternity a curse, are contrary to the law of God (as revealed in\r\n     nature), and to the precepts of Christ, and,\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas, These dogmas are an insidious poison, sapping the\r\n     vitality of our civilization, blighting woman, and, through her,\r\n     paralyzing humanity; therefore be it\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That we call on the Christian ministry, as leaders of\r\n     thought, to teach and enforce the fundamental idea of creation,\r\n     that man was made in the image of God, male and female, and given\r\n     equal rights over the earth, but none over each other. And,\r\n     furthermore, we ask their recognition of the scriptural declaration\r\n     that, in the Christian religion, there is neither male nor female,\r\n     bond nor free, but all are one in Christ Jesus.\"\r\n\r\nAs chairman of the committee I presented a series of resolutions,\r\nimpeaching the Christian theology--as well as all other forms of\r\nreligion, for their degrading teachings in regard to woman--which the\r\nmajority of the committee thought too strong and pointed, and, after\r\nmuch deliberation, they substituted the above, handing over to the Jews\r\nwhat I had laid at the door of the Christians. They thought they had so\r\nsugar-coated my ideas that the resolutions would pass without\r\ndiscussion. But some Jews in the convention promptly repudiated this\r\nimpression of their faith and precipitated the very discussion I\r\ndesired, but which our more politic friends would fain have avoided.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the decade meeting in Rochester, in 1878, Matilda\r\nJoslyn Gage, Edward M. Davis, and I had sedulously labored to rouse\r\nwomen to a realization of their degraded position in the Church, and\r\npresented resolutions at every annual convention for that purpose. But\r\nthey were either suppressed or so amended as to be meaningless. The\r\nresolutions of the annual convention of 1885, tame as they are, got into\r\nprint and roused the ire of the clergy, and upon the following Sunday,\r\nDr. Patton of Howard University preached a sermon on \"Woman and\r\nSkepticism,\" in which he unequivocally took the ground that freedom for\r\nwoman led to skepticism and immorality. He illustrated his position by\r\npointing to Hypatia, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frances Wright, George Eliot,\r\nHarriet Martineau, Mme. Roland, Frances Power Cobbe, and Victoria\r\nWoodhull. He made a grave mistake in the last names mentioned, as Mrs.\r\nWoodhull was a devout believer in the Christian religion, and surely\r\nanyone conversant with Miss Cobbe's writings would never accuse her of\r\nskepticism. His sermon was received with intense indignation, even by\r\nthe women of his own congregation. When he found what a whirlwind he had\r\nstarted, he tried to shift his position and explain away much that he\r\nhad said. We asked him to let us have the sermon for publication, that\r\nwe might not do him injustice. But as he contradicted himself flatly in\r\ntrying to restate his discourse, and refused to let us see his sermon,\r\nthose who heard him were disgusted with his sophistry and\r\ntergiversation.\r\n\r\nHowever, our labors in this direction are having an effect. Women are\r\nnow making their attacks on the Church all along the line. They are\r\ndemanding their right to be ordained as ministers, elders, deacons, and\r\nto be received as delegates in all the ecclesiastical convocations. At\r\nlast they ask of the Church just what they have asked of the State for\r\nthe last half century--perfect equality--and the clergy, as a body, are\r\nquite as hostile to their demands as the statesmen.\r\n\r\nOn my way back to Johnstown I spent ten days at Troy, where I preached\r\nin the Unitarian church on Sunday evening. During this visit we had two\r\nhearings in the Capitol at Albany--one in the Senate Chamber and one in\r\nthe Assembly, before the Committee on Grievances. On both occasions Mrs.\r\nMary Seymour Howell, Mrs. Devereux Blake, Mrs. Caroline Gilkey Rogers,\r\nand I addressed the Committee. Being open to the public, the chamber was\r\ncrowded. It was nearly forty years since I had made my first appeal in\r\nthe old Capitol at Albany. My reflections were sad and discouraging, as\r\nI sat there and listened to the speakers and remembered how long we had\r\nmade our appeals at that bar, from year to year, in vain. The members of\r\nthe committee presented the same calm aspect as their predecessors, as\r\nif to say, \"Be patient, dear sisters, eternity is before us; this is\r\nsimply a question of time. What may not come in your day, future\r\ngenerations will surely possess.\" It is always pleasant to know that\r\nour descendants are to enjoy life, liberty, and happiness; but, when one\r\nis gasping for one breath of freedom, this reflection is not satisfying.\r\n\r\nReturning to my native hills, I found the Lenten season had fairly set\r\nin, which I always dreaded on account of the solemn, tolling bell, the\r\nEpiscopal church being just opposite our residence. On Sunday we had the\r\nbells of six churches all going at the same time. It is strange how long\r\ncustoms continue after the original object has ceased to exist. At an\r\nearly day, when the country was sparsely settled and the people lived at\r\ngreat distances, bells were useful to call them together when there was\r\nto be a church service. But now, when the churches are always open on\r\nSunday, and every congregation knows the hour of services and all have\r\nclocks, bells are not only useless, but they are a terrible nuisance to\r\ninvalids and nervous people. If I am ever so fortunate as to be elected\r\na member of a town council, my first efforts will be toward the\r\nsuppression of bells.\r\n\r\nTo encourage one of my sex in the trying profession of book agent, I\r\npurchased, about this time, Dr. Lord's \"Beacon Lights of History,\" and\r\nread the last volume devoted to women, Pagan and Christian, saints and\r\nsinners. It is very amusing to see the author's intellectual wriggling\r\nand twisting to show that no one can be good or happy without believing\r\nin the Christian religion. In describing great women who are not\r\nChristians, he attributes all their follies and miseries to that fact.\r\nIn describing Pagan women, possessed of great virtues, he attributes all\r\ntheir virtues to Nature's gifts, which enable them to rise superior to\r\nsuperstitions. After dwelling on the dreary existence of those not of\r\nChristian faith, he forthwith pictures his St. Teresa going through\r\ntwenty years of doubts and fears about the salvation of her soul. The\r\nhappiest people I have known have been those who gave themselves no\r\nconcern about their own souls, but did their uttermost to mitigate the\r\nmiseries of others.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1885, we left Johnstown and took possession of our house at\r\nTenafly, New Jersey. It seemed very pleasant, after wandering in the Old\r\nWorld and the New, to be in my own home once more, surrounded by the\r\ngrand trees I so dearly loved; to see the gorgeous sunsets, the\r\ntwinkling fireflies; to hear the whippoorwills call their familiar note,\r\nwhile the June bugs and the mosquitoes buzz outside the nets through\r\nwhich they cannot enter. Many people complain of the mosquito in New\r\nJersey, when he can so easily be shut out of the family circle by nets\r\nover all the doors and windows. I had a long piazza, encased in netting,\r\nwhere paterfamilias, with his pipe, could muse and gaze at the stars\r\nunmolested.\r\n\r\nJune brought Miss Anthony and a box of fresh documents for another\r\nseason of work on vol. III. of our History. We had a flying visit from\r\nMiss Eddy of Providence, daughter of Mrs. Eddy who gave fifty thousand\r\ndollars to the woman suffrage movement, and a granddaughter of Francis\r\nJackson of Boston, who also left a generous bequest to our reform. We\r\nfound Miss Eddy a charming young woman with artistic tastes. She showed\r\nus several pen sketches she had made of some of our reformers, that were\r\nadmirable likenesses.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton's \"Random Recollections\" were published at this time and\r\nwere well received. A dinner was given him, on his eightieth birthday\r\n(June 27, 1885), by the Press Club of New York city, with speeches and\r\ntoasts by his lifelong friends. As no ladies were invited I can only\r\njudge from the reports in the daily papers, and what I could glean from\r\nthe honored guest himself, that it was a very interesting occasion.\r\n\r\nSitting in the summerhouse, one day, I witnessed a most amusing scene.\r\nTwo of the boys, in search of employment, broke up a hornets' nest.\r\nBruno, our large Saint Bernard dog, seeing them jumping about, thought\r\nhe would join in the fun. The boys tried to drive him away, knowing that\r\nthe hornets would get in his long hair, but Bruno's curiosity outran his\r\ncaution and he plunged into the midst of the swarm and was soon\r\ncompletely covered. The buzzing and stinging soon sent the poor dog\r\nhowling on the run. He rushed as usual, in his distress, to Amelia in\r\nthe kitchen, where she and the girls were making preserves and ironing.\r\nWhen they saw the hornets, they dropped irons, spoons, jars, everything,\r\nand rushed out of doors screaming. I appreciated the danger in time to\r\nget safely into the house before Bruno came to me for aid and comfort.\r\nAt last they played the hose on him until he found some relief; the\r\nmaidens, armed with towels, thrashed right and left, and the boys, with\r\nevergreen branches, fought bravely. I had often heard of \"stirring up a\r\nhornets' nest,\" but I had never before seen a practical demonstration of\r\nits danger. For days after, if Bruno heard anything buzz, he would rush\r\nfor the house at the top of his speed. But in spite of these occasional\r\nlively episodes, vol. III. went steadily on.\r\n\r\nMy suffrage sons and daughters through all the Northern and Western\r\nStates decided to celebrate, on the 12th of November, 1885, my\r\nseventieth birthday, by holding meetings or sending me gifts and\r\ncongratulations. This honor was suggested by Mrs. Elizabeth Boynton\r\nHarbert in _The New Era_, a paper she was editing at that time. The\r\nsuggestion met with a ready response. I was invited to deliver an essay\r\non \"The Pleasures of Age,\" before the suffrage association in New York\r\ncity. It took me a week to think them up, but with the inspiration of\r\nLongfellow's \"Morituri Salutamus,\" I was almost converted to the idea\r\nthat \"we old folks\" had the best of it.\r\n\r\nThe day was ushered in with telegrams, letters, and express packages,\r\nwhich continued to arrive during the week. From England, France, and\r\nGermany came cablegrams, presents, and letters of congratulation, and\r\nfrom all quarters came books, pictures, silver, bronzes, California\r\nblankets, and baskets of fruits and flowers. The eulogies in prose and\r\nverse were so hearty and numerous that the ridicule and criticism of\r\nforty years were buried so deep that I shall remember them no more.\r\nThere is no class who enjoy the praise of their fellow-men like those\r\nwho have had only blame most of their lives. The evening of the 12th we\r\nhad a delightful reunion at the home of Dr. Clemence Lozier, where I\r\ngave my essay, after which Mrs. Lozier, Mrs. Blake, Miss Anthony, \"Jenny\r\nJune,\" and some of the younger converts to our platform, all made short\r\nspeeches of praise and congratulation, which were followed by music,\r\nrecitations, and refreshments.\r\n\r\nAll during the autumn Miss Anthony and I looked forward to the spring,\r\nwhen we hoped to have completed the third and last volume of our\r\nHistory, and thus end the labors of ten years. We had neither time nor\r\neyesight to read aught but the imperative documents for the History. I\r\nwas hungering for some other mental pabulum.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1886, I was invited to dine with Laura Curtis Bullard, to\r\nmeet Mme. Durand (Henri Gréville), the novelist. She seemed a politic\r\nrather than an earnest woman of principle. As it was often very\r\ninconvenient for me to entertain distinguished visitors, who desired to\r\nmeet me in my country home during the winter, Mrs. Bullard generously\r\noffered always to invite them to her home. She and her good mother have\r\ndone their part in the reform movements in New York by their generous\r\nhospitalities.\r\n\r\nReading the debates in Congress, at that time, on a proposed\r\nappropriation for a monument to General Grant, I was glad to see that\r\nSenator Plumb of Kansas was brave enough to express his opinion against\r\nit. I fully agree with him. So long as multitudes of our people who are\r\ndoing the work of the world live in garrets and cellars, in ignorance,\r\npoverty, and vice, it is the duty of Congress to apply the surplus in\r\nthe national treasury to objects which will feed, clothe, shelter, and\r\neducate these wards of the State. If we must keep on continually\r\nbuilding monuments to great men, they should be handsome blocks of\r\ncomfortable homes for the poor, such as Peabody built in London. Senator\r\nHoar of Massachusetts favored the Grant monument, partly to cultivate\r\nthe artistic tastes of our people. We might as well cultivate our tastes\r\non useful dwellings as on useless monuments. Surely sanitary homes and\r\nschoolhouses for the living would be more appropriate monuments to wise\r\nstatesmen than the purest Parian shafts among the sepulchers of the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThe strikes and mobs and settled discontent of the masses warn us that,\r\nalthough we forget and neglect their interests and our duties, we do it\r\nat the peril of all. English statesmen are at their wits' end to-day\r\nwith their tangled social and industrial problems, threatening the\r\nthrone of a long line of kings. The impending danger cannot be averted\r\nby any surface measures; there must be a radical change in the relations\r\nof capital and labor.\r\n\r\nIn April rumors of a domestic invasion, wafted on every Atlantic breeze,\r\nwarned us that our children were coming from England and France--a party\r\nof six. Fortunately, the last line of the History was written, so Miss\r\nAnthony, with vol. III. and bushels of manuscripts, fled to the peaceful\r\nhome of her sister Mary at Rochester. The expected party sailed from\r\nLiverpool the 26th of May, on the _America_ After being out three days\r\nthe piston rod broke and they were obliged to return. My son-in-law,\r\nW.H. Blatch, was so seasick and disgusted that he remained in England,\r\nand took a fresh start two months later, and had a swift passage without\r\nany accidents. The rest were transferred to the _Germanic_, and reached\r\nNew York the 12th of June. Different divisions of the party were\r\narriving until midnight. Five people and twenty pieces of baggage! The\r\nconfusion of such an invasion quite upset the even tenor of our days,\r\nand it took some time for people and trunks to find their respective\r\nniches. However crowded elsewhere, there was plenty of room in our\r\nhearts, and we were unspeakably happy to have our flock all around us\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nI had long heard so many conflicting opinions about the Bible--some\r\nsaying it taught woman's emancipation and some her subjection--that,\r\nduring this visit of my children, the thought came to me that it Would\r\nbe well to collect every biblical reference to women in one small\r\ncompact volume, and see on which side the balance of influence really\r\nwas. To this end I proposed to organize a committee of competent women,\r\nwith some Latin, Greek, and Hebrew scholars in England and the United\r\nStates, for a thorough revision of the Old and New Testaments, and to\r\nascertain what the status of woman really was under the Jewish and\r\nChristian religion. As the Church has thus far interpreted the Bible as\r\nteaching woman's subjection, and none of the revisions by learned\r\necclesiastics have thrown any new light on the question, it seemed to me\r\npre-eminently proper and timely for women themselves to review the book.\r\nAs they are now studying theology in many institutions of learning,\r\nasking to be ordained as preachers, elders, deacons, and to be admitted,\r\nas delegates, to Synods and General Assemblies, and are refused on Bible\r\ngrounds, it seemed to me high time for women to consider those\r\nscriptural arguments and authorities.\r\n\r\nA happy coincidence enabled me at last to begin this work. While my\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Stanton Blatch, was with me, our friend Miss Frances\r\nLord, on our earnest invitation, came to America to visit us. She landed\r\nin New York the 4th of August, 1886. As it was Sunday she could not\r\ntelegraph, hence there was no one to meet her, and, as we all sat\r\nchatting on the front piazza, suddenly, to our surprise and delight, she\r\ndrove up. After a few days' rest and general talk of passing events, I\r\nlaid the subject so near my heart before her and my daughter. They\r\nresponded promptly and heartily, and we immediately set to work. I wrote\r\nto every woman who I thought might join such a committee, and Miss Lord\r\nran through the Bible in a few days, marking each chapter that in any\r\nway referred to women. We found that the work would not be so great as\r\nwe imagined, as all the facts and teachings in regard to women occupied\r\nless than one-tenth of the whole Scriptures. We purchased some cheap\r\nBibles, cut out the texts, pasted them at the head of the page, and,\r\nunderneath, wrote our commentaries as clearly and concisely as possible.\r\nWe did not intend to have sermons or essays, but brief comments, to keep\r\n\"The Woman's Bible\" as small as possible.\r\n\r\nMiss Lord and I worked several weeks together, and Mrs. Blatch and I,\r\nduring the winter of 1887, wrote all our commentaries on the Pentateuch.\r\nBut we could not succeed in forming the committee, nor, after writing\r\ninnumerable letters, make the women understand what we wanted to do. I\r\nstill have the commentaries of the few who responded, and the letters of\r\nthose who declined--a most varied and amusing bundle of manuscripts in\r\nthemselves. Some said the Bible had no special authority with them;\r\nthat, like the American Constitution, it could be interpreted to mean\r\nanything--slavery, when we protected that \"Institution,\" and freedom,\r\nwhen it existed no longer. Others said that woman's sphere was clearly\r\nmarked out in the Scriptures, and all attempt at emancipation was flying\r\nin the face of Providence. Others said they considered all the revisions\r\nmade by men thus far, had been so many acts of sacrilege, and they did\r\nhope women would not add their influence, to weaken the faith of the\r\npeople in the divine origin of the Holy Book, for, if men and women\r\ncould change it in one particular, they could in all. On the whole the\r\ncorrespondence was discouraging.\r\n\r\nLater Miss Lord became deeply interested in psychical researches, and I\r\ncould get no more work out of her. And as soon as we had finished the\r\nPentateuch, Mrs. Blatch declared she would go no farther; that it was\r\nthe driest history she had ever read, and most derogatory to women. My\r\nbeloved coadjutor, Susan B. Anthony, said that she thought it a work of\r\nsupererogation; that when our political equality was recognized and we\r\nbecame full-fledged American citizens, the Church would make haste to\r\nbring her Bibles and prayer books, creeds and discipline up to the same\r\nhigh-water mark of liberty.\r\n\r\nHelen Gardener said: \"I consider this a most important proposal, and if\r\nyou and I can ever stay on the same side of the Atlantic long enough, we\r\nwill join hands and do the work. In fact, I have begun already with\r\nPaul's Epistles, and am fascinated with the work. The untenable and\r\nunscientific positions he takes in regard to women are very amusing.\r\nAlthough the first chapter of Genesis teaches the simultaneous creation\r\nof man and woman, Paul bases woman's subjection on the priority of man,\r\nand because woman was of the man. As the historical fact is that, as far\r\nback as history dates, the man has been of the woman, should he\r\ntherefore be forever in bondage to her? Logically, according to Paul, he\r\nshould.\"\r\n\r\nI consulted several friends, such as Dr. William F. Channing, Mr. and\r\nMrs. Moncure D. Conway, Gertrude Garrison, Frederick Cabot, and Edward\r\nM. Davis, as to the advisability of the work, and they all agreed that\r\nsuch a volume, showing woman's position under the Jewish and Christian\r\nreligions, would be valuable, but none of them had time to assist in the\r\nproject. Though, owing to all these discouragements, I discontinued my\r\nwork, I never gave up the hope of renewing it some time, when other of\r\nmy coadjutors should awake to its importance and offer their services.\r\n\r\nOn October 27, 1886, with my daughter, nurse, and grandchild, I again\r\nsailed for England. Going out of the harbor in the clear early morning,\r\nwe had a fine view of Bartholdi's statue of Liberty Enlightening the\r\nWorld. We had a warm, gentle rain and a smooth sea most of the way, and,\r\nas we had a stateroom on deck, we could have the portholes open, and\r\nthus get all the air we desired. With novels and letters, chess and\r\nwhist the time passed pleasantly, and, on the ninth day, we landed in\r\nLiverpool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nENGLAND AND FRANCE REVISITED.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Basingstoke we found awaiting us cordial letters of\r\nwelcome from Miss Biggs, Miss Priestman, Mrs. Peter Taylor, Mrs.\r\nPriscilla McLaren, Miss Müller, Mrs. Jacob Bright, and Mme. de Barrau.\r\nDuring the winter Mrs. Margaret Bright Lucas, Drs. Kate and Julia\r\nMitchell, Mrs. Charles McLaren, Mrs. Saville, and Miss Balgarnie each\r\nspent a day or two with us. The full-dress costume of the ladies was a\r\ngreat surprise to my little granddaughter Nora. She had never seen bare\r\nshoulders in a drawing room, and at the first glance she could not\r\nbelieve her eyes. She slowly made the circuit of the room, coming nearer\r\nand nearer until she touched the lady's neck to see whether or not it\r\nwas covered with some peculiar shade of dress, but finding the bare skin\r\nshe said: \"Why, you are not dressed, are you? I see your skin!\" The\r\nscene suggested to me the amusing description in Holmes' \"Elsie Venner,\"\r\nof the efforts of a young lady, seated between two old gentlemen, to\r\nshow off her white shoulders. The vicar would not look, but steadily\r\nprayed that he might not be led into temptation; but the physician, with\r\ngreater moral hardihood, deliberately surveyed the offered charms, with\r\nspectacles on his nose.\r\n\r\nIn December Hattie and I finished Dowden's \"Life of Shelley,\" which we\r\nhad been reading together. Here we find a sensitive, refined nature,\r\nfull of noble purposes, thrown out when too young to meet all life's\r\nemergencies, with no loving Mentor to guard him from blunders or to help\r\nto retrieve the consequences of his false positions. Had he been\r\nsurrounded with a few true friends, who could appreciate what was great\r\nin him and pity what was weak, his life would have been different. His\r\nfather was hard, exacting, and unreasonable; hence he had no influence.\r\nHis mother had neither the wisdom to influence him, nor the courage to\r\nrebuke her husband; and alas! poor woman, she was in such thraldom\r\nherself to conventionalisms, that she could not understand a youth who\r\nset them all at defiance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE GENERATIONS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY.]\r\n\r\nWe also read Cotton Morrison's \"Service of Man,\" which I hope will be a\r\nnew inspiration to fresh labors by all for the elevation of humanity,\r\nand Carnegie's \"Triumphant Democracy,\" showing the power our country is\r\ndestined to wield and the vastness of our domain. This book must give\r\nevery American citizen a feeling of deeper responsibility than ever\r\nbefore to act well his part. We read, too, Harriet Martineau's\r\ntranslation of the works of Auguste Comte, and found the part on woman\r\nmost unsatisfactory. He criticises Aristotle's belief that slavery is a\r\nnecessary element of social life, yet seems to think the subjection of\r\nwoman in modern civilization a matter of no importance.\r\n\r\nAll through that winter Hattie and I occupied our time studying the\r\nBible and reading the commentaries of Clark, Scott, and Wordsworth\r\n(Bishop of Lincoln). We found nothing grand in the history of the Jews\r\nnor in the morals inculcated in the Pentateuch. Surely the writers had a\r\nvery low idea of the nature of their God. They make Him not only\r\nanthropomorphic, but of the very lowest type, jealous and revengeful,\r\nloving violence rather than mercy. I know no other books that so fully\r\nteach the subjection and degradation of woman. Miriam, the eldest sister\r\nof Moses and Aaron, a genius, a prophetess, with the family aptitude for\r\ndiplomacy and government, is continually set aside because of her\r\nsex--permitted to lead the women in singing and dancing, nothing more.\r\nNo woman could offer sacrifices nor eat the holy meats because,\r\naccording to the Jews, she was too unclean and unholy.\r\n\r\nBut what is the use, say some, of attaching any importance to the\r\ncustoms and teachings of a barbarous people? None whatever. But when our\r\nbishops, archbishops, and ordained clergymen stand up in their pulpits\r\nand read selections from the Pentateuch with reverential voice, they\r\nmake the women of their congregation believe that there really is some\r\ndivine authority for their subjection. In the Thirty-First Chapter of\r\nNumbers, in speaking of the spoils taken from the Midianites, the live\r\nstock is thus summarized: \"Five thousand sheep, threescore and twelve\r\nthousand beeves, threescore and one thousand asses, and thirty-two\r\nthousand women and women-children,\" which Moses said the warriors might\r\nkeep for themselves. What a pity a Stead had not been there, to protect\r\nthe child-women of the Midianites and rebuke the Lord's chosen people as\r\nthey deserved! In placing the women after the sheep, the beeves, and the\r\nasses, we have a fair idea of their comparative importance in the scale\r\nof being, among the Jewish warriors. No wonder the right reverend\r\nbishops and clergy of the Methodist Church, who believe in the divine\r\norigin and authority of the Pentateuch, exclude women from their great\r\nconvocations in the American Republic in the nineteenth century. In view\r\nof the fact that our children are taught to reverence the book as of\r\ndivine origin, I think we have a right to ask that, in the next\r\nrevision, all such passages be expurgated, and to that end learned,\r\ncompetent women must have an equal place on the revising committee.\r\n\r\nMrs. Margaret Bright Lucas came, in February, to spend a few days with\r\nus. She was greatly shocked with many texts in the Old Testament, to\r\nwhich we called her attention, and said: \"Here is an insidious influence\r\nagainst the elevation of women, which but few of us have ever taken into\r\nconsideration.\" She had just returned from a flying visit to America;\r\nhaving made two voyages across the Atlantic and traveled three thousand\r\nmiles across the continent in two months, and this at the age of\r\nsixty-eight years. She was enthusiastic in her praises of the women she\r\nmet in the United States. As her name was already on the committee to\r\nprepare \"The Woman's Bible,\" we had her hearty approval of the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nIn October Hattie went to London, to attend a meeting to form a Woman's\r\nLiberal Federation. Mrs. Gladstone presided. The speeches made were\r\nsimply absurd, asking women to organize themselves to help the Liberal\r\nparty, which had steadily denied to them the political rights they had\r\ndemanded for twenty years. Professor Stuart capped the climax of insult\r\nwhen he urged as \"one great advantage in getting women to canvass for\r\nthe Liberal party was that they would give their services free.\" The\r\nLiberals saw what enthusiasm the Primrose Dames had roused for the Tory\r\nparty, really carrying the election, and they determined to utilize a\r\nsimilar force in their ranks. But the whole movement was an insult to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nThe one absorbing interest, then, was the Queen's Jubilee. Ladies formed\r\nsocieties to collect funds to place at the disposal of the Queen. Every\r\nlittle village was divided into districts, and different ladies took the\r\nrounds, begging pennies at every door of servants and the laboring\r\nmasses, and pounds of the wealthy people. One of them paid us a visit.\r\nShe asked the maid who opened the door to see the rest of the servants,\r\nand she begged a penny of each of them. She then asked to see the\r\nmistress. My daughter descended; but, instead of a pound, she gave her a\r\nlecture on the Queen's avarice. When the fund was started the people\r\nsupposed the Queen was to return it all to the people in liberal\r\nendowments of charitable institutions, but her Majesty proposed to build\r\na monument to Prince Albert, although he already had one in London. \"The\r\nQueen,\" said my daughter, \"should celebrate her Jubilee by giving good\r\ngifts to her subjects, and not by filching from the poor their pennies.\r\nTo give half her worldly possessions to her impoverished people, to give\r\nHome Rule to Ireland, or to make her public schools free, would be deeds\r\nworthy her Jubilee; but to take another cent from those who are\r\nhopelessly poor is a sin against suffering humanity.\" The young woman\r\nrealized the situation and said: \"I shall go no farther. I wish I could\r\nreturn every penny I have taken from the needy.\"\r\n\r\nThe most fitting monuments this nation can build are schoolhouses and\r\nhomes for those who do the work of the world. It is no answer to say\r\nthat they are accustomed to rags and hunger. In this world of plenty\r\nevery human being has a right to food, clothes, decent shelter, and the\r\nrudiments of education. \"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark\"\r\nwhen one-tenth of the human family, booted and spurred, ride the masses\r\nto destruction. I detest the words \"royalty\" and \"nobility,\" and all the\r\nideas and institutions based on their recognition. In April the great\r\nmeeting in Hyde Park occurred--a meeting of protest against the Irish\r\nCoercion Bill. It was encouraging to see that there is a democratic as\r\nwell as an aristocratic England. The London journals gave very different\r\naccounts of the meeting. The Tories said it was a mob of inconsequential\r\ncranks. Reason teaches us, however, that you cannot get up a large,\r\nenthusiastic meeting unless there is some question pending that touches\r\nthe heart of the people. Those who say that Ireland has no grievances\r\nare ignorant alike of human nature and the facts of history.\r\n\r\nOn April 14 I went to Paris, my daughter escorting me to Dover, and my\r\nson meeting me at Calais. It was a bright, pleasant day, and I sat on\r\ndeck and enjoyed the trip, though many of my fellow passengers were pale\r\nand limp. Whirling to Paris in an easy car, through the beautiful\r\nwheatfields and vineyards, I thought of the old lumbering diligence, in\r\nwhich we went up to Paris at a snail's pace forty years before. I\r\nremained in Paris until October, and never enjoyed six months more\r\nthoroughly. One of my chief pleasures was making the acquaintance of my\r\nfourth son, Theodore. I had seen but little of him since he was sixteen\r\nyears old, as he then spent five years at Cornell University, and as\r\nmany more in Germany and France. He had already published two works,\r\n\"The Life of Thiers,\" and \"The Woman Question in Europe.\" To have a son\r\ninterested in the question to which I have devoted my life, is a source\r\nof intense satisfaction. To say that I have realized in him all I could\r\ndesire, is the highest praise a fond mother can give.\r\n\r\nMy first experience in an apartment, living on an even plane, no running\r\nup and down stairs, was as pleasant as it was surprising. I had no idea\r\nof the comfort and convenience of this method of keeping house. Our\r\napartment in Paris consisted of drawing room, dining room, library, a\r\ngood-sized hall, in which stood a large American stove, five bedrooms,\r\nbathroom, and kitchen, and a balcony fifty-two feet long and four feet\r\nwide. The first few days it made me dizzy to look down from this balcony\r\nto the street below. I was afraid the whole structure would give way, it\r\nappeared so light and airy, hanging midway between earth and heaven. But\r\nmy confidence in its steadfastness and integrity grew day by day, and it\r\nbecame my favorite resort, commanding, as it did, a magnificent view of\r\nthe whole city and distant surroundings.\r\n\r\nThere were so many Americans in town, and French reformers to be seen,\r\nthat I gave Wednesday afternoon receptions during my whole visit. To one\r\nof our \"at homes\" came Mlle. Maria Deraismes, the only female Free Mason\r\nin France, and the best woman orator in the country; her sister, Mme.\r\nFéresse-Deraismes, who takes part in all woman movements; M. Léon\r\nRicher, then actively advocating the civil and political rights of women\r\nthrough the columns of his vigorous journal; Mme. Griess Traut, who\r\nmakes a specialty of Peace work; Mme. Isabelle Bogelot, who afterward\r\nattended the Washington Council of 1888, and who is a leader in charity\r\nwork; the late Mme. Emilie de Morsier, who afterward was the soul of the\r\nInternational Congress of 1889, at Paris; Mme. Pauline Kergomard, the\r\nfirst woman to be made a member of the Superior Council of public\r\nInstruction in France, and Mme. Henri Gréville, the novelist.\r\n\r\nAmong the American guests at our various Wednesday receptions were Mr.\r\nand Mrs. John Bigelow, Mr. and Mrs. James G. Blaine, Mr. Daniel C.\r\nFrench, the Concord sculptor; Mrs. J.C. Ayer, Mr. L. White Busbey, one\r\nof the editors of the Chicago _Inter-Ocean_; Rev. Dr. Henry M. Field,\r\nCharles Gifford Dyer, the painter and father of the gifted young\r\nviolinist, Miss Hella Dyer; the late Rev. Mr. Moffett, then United\r\nStates Consul at Athens, Mrs. Governor Bagley and daughter of Michigan;\r\nGrace Greenwood and her talented daughter, who charmed everyone with her\r\nmelodious voice, and Miss Bryant, daughter of the poet. One visitor who\r\ninterested us most was the Norwegian novelist and republican,\r\nBjornstjorne Bjornson.\r\n\r\nWe had several pleasant interviews with Frederick Douglass and his wife,\r\nsome exciting games of chess with Theodore Tilton, in the pleasant\r\napartments of the late W.J.A. Fuller, Esq., and his daughter, Miss Kate\r\nFuller. At this time I also met our brilliant countrywoman, Louise\r\nChandler Moulton. Seeing so many familiar faces, I could easily imagine\r\nmyself in New York rather than in Paris. I attended several receptions\r\nand dined with Mrs. Charlotte Beebe Wilbour, greatly enjoying her clever\r\ndescriptions of a winter on the Nile in her own dahabeeyeh. I heard Père\r\nHyacinthe preach, and met his American wife on several occasions. I took\r\nlong drives every day through the parks and pleasant parts of the city.\r\nWith garden concerts, operas, theaters, and the Hippodrome I found\r\nabundant amusement. I never grew weary of the latter performance--the\r\nwonderful intelligence displayed there by animals, being a fresh\r\nsurprise to me every time I went.\r\n\r\nI attended a reception at the Elysée Palace, escorted by M. Joseph\r\nFabre, then a deputy and now a senator. M. Fabre is the author of a play\r\nand several volumes devoted to Joan of Arc. He presented me to the\r\nPresident and to Mme. Jules Grévy. I was also introduced to M. Jules\r\nFerry, then Prime Minister, who said, among other things: \"I am sorry to\r\nconfess it, but it is only too true, our French women are far behind\r\ntheir sisters in America.\" The beautiful, large garden was thrown open\r\nthat evening,--it was in July,--and the fine band of the Republican\r\nGuard gave a delightful concert under the big trees. I also met M.\r\nGrévy's son-in-law, M. Daniel Wilson. He was then a deputy and one of\r\nthe most powerful politicians in France. A few months later he caused\r\nhis father's political downfall. I have a vivid recollection of him\r\nbecause he could speak English, his father having been a British\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nI visited the picture galleries once more, after a lapse of nearly fifty\r\nyears, and was struck by the fact that, in that interval, several women\r\nhad been admitted to places of honor. This was especially noticeable in\r\nthe Luxembourg Sculpture Gallery, where two women, Mme. Bertaux and the\r\nlate Claude Vignon, wife of M. Rouvier, were both represented by good\r\nwork--the first and only women sculptors admitted to that gallery.\r\n\r\nAt a breakfast party which we gave, I made the acquaintance of General\r\nCluseret, who figured in our Civil War, afterward became War Minister\r\nof the Paris Commune, and is now member of the Chamber of Deputies. He\r\nlearned English when in America, and had not entirely forgotten it. He\r\ntold anecdotes of Lincoln, Stanton, Sumner, Fremont, Garibaldi, the\r\nCount of Paris, and many other famous men whom he once knew, and proved\r\nto be a very interesting conversationalist.\r\n\r\nOld bookstands were always attractive centers of interest to Theodore,\r\nand, among other treasure-troves, he brought home one day a boy of\r\nfourteen years, whose office it had been to watch the books. He was a\r\nbright, cheery little fellow of mixed French and German descent, who\r\ncould speak English, French, and German. He was just what we had\r\ndesired, to run errands and tend the door. As he was delighted with the\r\nidea of coming to us, we went to see his parents. We were pleased with\r\ntheir appearance and surroundings. We learned that they were members of\r\nthe Lutheran Church, that the boy was one of the shining lights in\r\nSunday school, and the only point in our agreement on which they were\r\nstrenuous was that he should go regularly to Sunday school and have time\r\nto learn his lessons.\r\n\r\nSo \"Immanuel\" commenced a new life with us, and as we had unbounded\r\nconfidence in the boy's integrity, we excused his shortcomings, and, for\r\na time, believed all he said. But before long we found out that the\r\nmoment we left the house he was in the drawing room, investigating every\r\ndrawer, playing on the piano, or sleeping on the sofa. Though he was\r\ntold never to touch the hall stove, he would go and open all the\r\ndraughts and make it red-hot. Then we adopted the plan of locking up\r\nevery part of the apartment but the kitchen. He amused himself burning\r\nholes through the pantry shelves, when the cook was out, and boring\r\nholes, with a gimlet, through a handsomely carved bread board. One day,\r\nin making up a spare bed for a friend, under the mattress were found\r\ninnumerable letters he was supposed to have mailed at different times.\r\nWhen we reprimanded him for his pranks he would look at us steadily, but\r\nsorrowfully, and, immediately afterward, we would hear him dancing down\r\nthe corridor singing, \"Safe in the Arms of Jesus.\" If he had given heed\r\nto one-half we said to him, he would have been safer in our hands than\r\nin those of his imaginary protector. He turned out a thief, an\r\nunmitigated liar, a dancing dervish, and, through all our experiences of\r\nsix weeks with him, his chief reading was his Bible and Sunday-school\r\nbooks. The experience, however, was not lost on Theodore--he has never\r\nsuggested a boy since, and a faithful daughter of Eve reigns in his\r\nstead.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer I was in the hands of two artists, Miss Anna Klumpke,\r\nwho painted my portrait, and Paul Bartlett, who molded my head in clay.\r\nTo shorten the operation, sometimes I sat for both at the same time.\r\nAlthough neither was fully satisfied with the results of their labors,\r\nwe had many pleasant hours together, discussing their art, their early\r\ntrials, and artists in general. Each had good places in the _Salon_, and\r\nhonorable mention that year. It is sad to see so many American girls and\r\nboys, who have no genius for painting or sculpture, spending their days\r\nin garrets, in solitude and poverty, with the vain hope of earning\r\ndistinction. Women of all classes are awaking to the necessity of\r\nself-support, but few are willing to do the ordinary useful work for\r\nwhich they are fitted. In the _Salon_ that year six thousand pictures\r\nwere offered, and only two thousand accepted, and many of these were\r\n\"skyed.\"\r\n\r\nIt was lovely on our balcony at night to watch the little boats, with\r\ntheir lights, sailing up and down the Seine, especially the day of the\r\ngreat annual fête,--the 14th of July,--when the whole city was\r\nmagnificently illuminated. We drove about the city on several occasions\r\nat midnight, to see the life--men, women, and children enjoying the cool\r\nbreezes, and the restaurants all crowded with people.\r\n\r\nSunday in Paris is charming--it is the day for the masses of the people.\r\nAll the galleries of art, the libraries, concert halls, and gardens are\r\nopen to them. All are dressed in their best, out driving, walking, and\r\nhaving picnics in the various parks and gardens; husbands, wives, and\r\nchildren laughing and talking happily together. The seats in the streets\r\nand parks are all filled with the laboring masses. The benches all over\r\nParis--along the curbstones in every street and highway--show the care\r\ngiven to the comfort of the people. You will see mothers and nurses with\r\ntheir babies and children resting on these benches, laboring men eating\r\ntheir lunches and sleeping there at noon, the organ grinders and\r\nmonkeys, too, taking their comfort. In France you see men and women\r\neverywhere together; in England the men generally stagger about alone,\r\ncaring more for their pipes and beer than their mothers, wives, and\r\nsisters. Social life, among the poor especially, is far more natural and\r\nharmonious in France than in England, because women mix more freely in\r\nbusiness and amusements.\r\n\r\nComing directly from Paris to London, one is forcibly struck with the\r\ngloom of the latter city, especially at night. Paris with its electric\r\nlights is brilliant everywhere, while London, with its meager gas jets\r\nhere and there struggling with the darkness, is as gloomy and desolate\r\nas Dore's pictures of Dante's Inferno. On Sunday, when the shops are\r\nclosed, the silence and solitude of the streets, the general smoky\r\nblackness of the buildings and the atmosphere give one a melancholy\r\nimpression of the great center of civilization. Now that it has been\r\ndiscovered that smoke can be utilized and the atmosphere cleared, it is\r\nastonishing that the authorities do not avail themselves of the\r\ndiscovery, and thus bring light and joy and sunshine into that city, and\r\nthen clean the soot of centuries from their blackened buildings.\r\n\r\nOn my return to England I spent a day with Miss Emily Lord, at her\r\nkindergarten establishment. She had just returned from Sweden, where she\r\nspent six weeks in the carpenter's shop, studying the Swedish Slöjd\r\nsystem, in which children of twelve years old learn to use tools, making\r\nspoons, forks, and other implements. Miss Lord showed us some of her\r\nwork, quite creditable for her first attempts. She said the children in\r\nthe higher grades of her school enjoyed the carpenter work immensely and\r\nbecame very deft in the use of tools.\r\n\r\nOn November 1, 1887, we reached Basingstoke once more, and found all\r\nthings in order. My diary tells of several books I read during the\r\nwinter and what the authors say of women; one the \"Religio Medici,\" by\r\nSir Thomas Browne, M.D., in which the author discourses on many high\r\nthemes, God, Creation, Heaven, Hell, and vouchsafes one sentence on\r\nwoman. Of her he says: \"I was never married but once and commend their\r\nresolution who never marry twice, not that I disallow of second, nor in\r\nall cases of polygamy, which, considering the unequal number of the\r\nsexes, may also be necessary. The whole world was made for man, but the\r\ntwelfth part of man for woman. Man is the whole world--the breath of\r\nGod; woman the rib and crooked piece of man. I speak not in prejudice\r\nnor am averse from that sweet sex, but naturally amorous of all that is\r\nbeautiful. I can look all day at a handsome picture, though it be but a\r\nhorse.\"\r\n\r\nTurning to John Paul Friedrich Richter, I found in his chapter on woman\r\nmany equally ridiculous statements mixed up with much fulsome\r\nadmiration. After reading some volumes of Richter, I took up Heinrich\r\nHeine, the German poet and writer. He said: \"Oh, the women! We must\r\nforgive them much, for they love much and many. Their hate is, properly,\r\nonly love turned inside out. Sometimes they attribute some delinquency\r\nto us, because they think they can, in this way, gratify another man.\r\nWhen they write they have always one eye on the paper and the other eye\r\non some man. This is true of all authoresses except the Countess Hahn\r\nHahn, who has only one eye.\" John Ruskin's biography he gives us a\r\nglimpse of his timidity in regard to the sex, when a young man. He was\r\nvery fond of the society of girls, but never knew how to approach them.\r\nHe said he \"was perfectly happy in serving them, would gladly make a\r\nbridge of himself for them to walk over, a beam to fasten a swing to for\r\nthem--anything but to talk to them.\" Such are some of the choice\r\nspecimens of masculine wit I collected during my winter's reading!\r\n\r\nAt a reception given to me by Drs. Julia and Kate Mitchell, sisters\r\npracticing medicine in London, I met Stepniak, the Russian Nihilist, a\r\nman of grand presence and fine conversational powers. He was about to go\r\nto America, apprehensive lest our Government should make an extradition\r\ntreaty with Russia to return political offenders, as he knew that\r\nproposal had been made. A few weeks later he did visit the United\r\nStates, and had a hearing before a committee of the Senate. He pointed\r\nout the character of the Nihilist movement, declaring Nihilists to be\r\nthe real reformers, the true lovers of liberty, sacrificing themselves\r\nfor the best interests of the people, and yet, as political prisoners,\r\nthey are treated worse than the lowest class of criminals in the prisons\r\nand mines of Siberia.\r\n\r\nI had a very unpleasant interview, during this visit to London, with\r\nMiss Lydia Becker, Miss Caroline Biggs, and Miss Blackburn, at the\r\nMetropole, about choosing delegates to the International Council of\r\nWomen soon to be held in Washington. As there had been some\r\nirreconcilable dissensions in the suffrage association, and they could\r\nnot agree as to whom their delegate should be, they decided to send none\r\nat all. I wrote at once to Mrs. Priscilla Bright McLaren, pointing out\r\nwhat a shame it would be if England, above all countries, should not be\r\nrepresented in the first International Council ever called by a suffrage\r\nassociation. She replied promptly that must not be, and immediately\r\nmoved in the matter, and through her efforts three delegates were soon\r\nauthorized to go, representing different constituencies--Mrs. Alice\r\nCliff Scatcherd, Mrs. Ormiston Chant, and Mrs. Ashton Dilke.\r\n\r\nToward the last of February, 1888, we went again to London to make a\r\nfew farewell visits to dear friends. We spent a few days with Mrs. Mona\r\nCaird, who was then reading Karl Pearson's lectures on \"Woman,\" and\r\nexpounding her views on marriage, which she afterward gave to the\r\nWestminster Review, and stirred the press to white heat both in England\r\nand America. \"Is Marriage a Failure?\" furnished the heading for our\r\nquack advertisements for a long time after. Mrs. Caird was a very\r\ngraceful, pleasing woman, and so gentle in manner and appearance that no\r\none would deem her capable of hurling such thunderbolts at the\r\nlong-suffering Saxon people.\r\n\r\nWe devoted one day to Prince Krapotkine, who lives at Harrow, in the\r\nsuburbs of London. A friend of his, Mr. Lieneff, escorted us there. We\r\nfound the prince, his wife, and child in very humble quarters;\r\nuncarpeted floors, books and papers on pine shelves, wooden chairs, and\r\nthe bare necessaries of life--nothing more. They indulge in no luxuries,\r\nbut devote all they can spare to the publication of liberal opinions to\r\nbe scattered in Russia, and to help Nihilists in escaping from the\r\ndominions of the Czar. The prince and princess took turns in holding and\r\namusing the baby--then only one year old; fortunately it slept most of\r\nthe time, so that the conversation flowed on for some hours. Krapotkine\r\ntold us of his sad prison experiences, both in France and Russia. He\r\nsaid the series of articles by George Kennan in the _Century_ were not\r\ntoo highly colored, that the sufferings of men and women in Siberia and\r\nthe Russian prisons could not be overdrawn. One of the refinements of\r\ncruelty they practice on prisoners is never to allow them to hear the\r\nhuman voice. A soldier always accompanies the warder who distributes\r\nthe food, to see that no word is spoken. In vain the poor prisoner asks\r\nquestions, no answer is ever made, no tidings from the outside world\r\never given. One may well ask what devil in human form has prescribed\r\nsuch prison life and discipline! I wonder if we could find a man in all\r\nRussia who would defend the system, yet someone is responsible for its\r\nterrible cruelties!\r\n\r\nWe returned to Basingstoke, passed the few remaining days in looking\r\nover papers and packing for the voyage, and, on March 4, 1888, Mrs.\r\nBlatch went with me to Southampton. On the train I met my companions for\r\nthe voyage, Mrs. Gustafsen, Mrs. Ashton Dilke, and Baroness Gripenberg,\r\nfrom Finland, a very charming woman, to whom I felt a strong attraction.\r\nThe other delegates sailed from Liverpool. We had a rough voyage and\r\nmost of the passengers were very sick. Mrs. Dilke and I were well,\r\nhowever, and on deck every day, always ready to play whist and chess\r\nwith a few gentlemen who were equally fortunate. I was much impressed\r\nwith Mrs. Dilke's kindness and generosity in serving others. There was a\r\nlady on board with two children, whose nurse at the last minute refused\r\nto go with her. The mother was sick most of the way, and Mrs. Dilke did\r\nall in her power to relieve her, by amusing the little boy, telling him\r\nstories, walking with him on deck, and watching him throughout the day,\r\nno easy task to perform for an entire stranger. The poor little mother\r\nwith a baby in her arms must have appreciated such kindly attention.\r\n\r\nWhen the pilot met us off Sandy Hook, he brought news of the terrible\r\nblizzard New York had just experienced, by which all communication with\r\nthe world at large was practically suspended. The captain brought him\r\ndown into the saloon to tell us all about it. The news was so startling\r\nthat at first we thought the pilot was joking, but when he produced the\r\nmetropolitan journals to verify his statements, we listened to the\r\nreading and what he had to say with profound astonishment. The second\r\nweek in March, 1888, will be memorable in the history of storms in the\r\nvicinity of New York. The snow was ten feet deep in some places, and the\r\nside streets impassable either for carriages or sleighs. I hoped the\r\ncity would be looking its best, for the first impression on my foreign\r\nfriends, but it never looked worse, with huge piles of snow everywhere\r\ncovered with black dust.\r\n\r\nI started for Washington at three o'clock, the day after our arrival,\r\nreached there at ten o'clock, and found my beloved friends, Miss Anthony\r\nand Mrs. Spofford, with open arms and warm hearts to receive me. As the\r\nvessel was delayed two days, our friends naturally thought we, too, had\r\nencountered a blizzard, but we had felt nothing of it; on the contrary\r\nthe last days were the most pleasant of the voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to the idea of the feasibility and need of an International\r\nCouncil of Women, mentioned in a preceding chapter, it was decided to\r\ncelebrate the fourth decade of the woman suffrage movement in the United\r\nStates by calling together such a council. At its nineteenth annual\r\nconvention, held in January, 1887, the National Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation resolved to assume the entire responsibility of holding a\r\ncouncil, and to extend an invitation, for that purpose, to all\r\nassociations of women in the trades, professions, and reforms, as well\r\nas those advocating political rights. Early in June, 1887, a call was\r\nissued for such a council to convene under the auspices of the National\r\nWoman Suffrage Association at Washington, D. C, on March 25, 1888. The\r\ngrand assemblage of women, coming from all the countries of the\r\ncivilized globe, proved that the call for such a council was opportune,\r\nwhile the order and dignity of the proceedings proved the women worthy\r\nthe occasion. No one doubts now the wisdom of that initiative step nor\r\nthe added power women have gained over popular thought through the\r\nInternational Council.\r\n\r\nAs the proceedings of the contention were fully and graphically reported\r\nin the _Woman's Tribune_ at that time, and as its reports were afterward\r\npublished in book form, revised and corrected by Miss Anthony, Miss\r\nFoster, and myself, I will merely say that our most sanguine\r\nexpectations as to its success were more than realized. The large\r\ntheater was crowded for an entire week, and hosts of able women spoke,\r\nas if specially inspired, on all the vital questions of the hour.\r\nAlthough the council was called and conducted by the suffrage\r\nassociation, yet various other societies were represented. Miss Anthony\r\nwas the financier of the occasion and raised twelve thousand dollars for\r\nthe purpose, which enabled her to pay all the expenses of the delegates\r\nin Washington, and for printing the report in book form. As soon as I\r\nreached Washington, Miss Anthony ordered me to remain conscientiously in\r\nmy own apartment and to prepare a speech for delivery before the\r\ncommittees of the Senate and House, and another, as President, for the\r\nopening of the council. However, as Mrs. Spofford placed her carriage at\r\nour service, I was permitted to drive an hour or two every day about\r\nthat magnificent city.\r\n\r\nOne of the best speeches at the council was made by Helen H. Gardener.\r\nIt was a criticism of Dr. Hammond's position in regard to the inferior\r\nsize and quality of woman's brain. As the doctor had never had the\r\nopportunity of examining the brains of the most distinguished women,\r\nand, probably, those only of paupers and criminals, she felt he had no\r\ndata on which to base his conclusions. Moreover, she had the written\r\nopinion of several leading physicians, that it was quite impossible to\r\ndistinguish the male from the female brain.\r\n\r\nThe hearing at the Capitol, after the meeting of the council, was very\r\ninteresting, as all the foreign delegates were invited to speak each in\r\nthe language of her own country; to address their alleged\r\nrepresentatives in the halls of legislation was a privilege they had\r\nnever enjoyed at home. It is very remarkable that English women have\r\nnever made the demand for a hearing in the House of Commons, nor even\r\nfor a decent place to sit, where they can hear the debates and see the\r\nfine proportions of the representatives. The delegates had several\r\nbrilliant receptions at the Riggs House, and at the houses of Senator\r\nStanford of California and Senator Palmer of Michigan. Miss Anthony and\r\nI spent two months in Washington, that winter. One of the great\r\npleasures of our annual conventions was the reunion of our friends at\r\nthe Riggs House, where we enjoyed the boundless hospitality of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Spofford.\r\n\r\nThe month of June I spent in New York city, where I attended several of\r\nColonel Robert G. Ingersoll's receptions and saw the great orator and\r\niconoclast at his own fireside, surrounded by his admirers, and heard\r\nhis beautiful daughters sing, which gave all who listened great\r\npleasure, as they have remarkably fine voices. One has since married,\r\nand is now pouring out her richest melodies in the opera of lullaby in\r\nher own nursery.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1888, as Ohio was about to hold a Constitutional\r\nconvention, at the request of the suffrage association I wrote an appeal\r\nto the women of the State to demand their right to vote for delegates to\r\nsuch convention. Mrs. Southworth had five thousand copies of my appeal\r\npublished and distributed at the exposition in Columbus. If ten\r\nrighteous men could save Sodom, all the brilliant women I met in\r\nCleveland should have saved Ohio from masculine domination.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1888-89 I was to spend with my daughter in Omaha. I\r\nreached there in time to witness the celebration of the completion of\r\nthe first bridge between that city and Council Bluffs. There was a grand\r\nprocession in which all the industries of both towns were represented,\r\nand which occupied six hours in passing. We had a desirable position for\r\nreviewing the pageant, and very pleasant company to interpret the\r\nmottoes, symbols, and banners. The bridge practically brings the towns\r\ntogether, as electric street cars now run from one to the other in ten\r\nminutes. Here, for the first time, I saw the cable cars running up hill\r\nand down without any visible means of locomotion.\r\n\r\nAs the company ran an open car all winter, I took my daily ride of nine\r\nmiles in it for fifteen cents. My son Daniel, who escorted me, always\r\nsat inside the car, while I remained on an outside seat. He was greatly\r\namused with the remarks he heard about that \"queer old lady that always\r\nrode outside in all kinds of wintry weather.\" One day someone remarked\r\nloud enough for all to hear: \"It is evident that woman does not know\r\nenough to come in when it rains.\" \"Bless me!\" said the conductor, who\r\nknew me, \"that woman knows as much as the Queen of England; too much to\r\ncome in here by a hot stove.\" How little we understand the comparative\r\nposition of those whom we often criticise. There I sat enjoying the\r\nbracing air, the pure fresh breezes, indifferent to the fate of an old\r\ncloak and hood that had crossed the Atlantic and been saturated with\r\nsalt water many times, pitying the women inside breathing air laden with\r\nmicrobes that dozens of people had been throwing off from time to time,\r\nsacrificing themselves to their stylish bonnets, cloaks, and dresses,\r\nsuffering with the heat of the red-hot stove; and yet they, in turn,\r\npitying me.\r\n\r\nMy seventy-third birthday I spent with my son Gerrit Smith Stanton, on\r\nhis farm near Portsmouth, Iowa. As we had not met in several years, it\r\ntook us a long time, in the network of life, to pick up all the stitches\r\nthat had dropped since we parted. I amused myself darning stockings and\r\ndrawing plans for an addition to his house. But in the spring my son and\r\nhis wife came to the conclusion that they had had enough of the solitude\r\nof farm life and turned their faces eastward.\r\n\r\nSoon after my return to Omaha, the editor of the _Woman's Tribune_, Mrs.\r\nClara B. Colby, called and lunched with us one day. She announced the\r\ncoming State convention, at which I was expected \"to make the best\r\nspeech of my life.\" She had all the arrangements to make, and invited me\r\nto drive round with her, in order that she might talk by the way. She\r\nengaged the Opera House, made arrangements at the Paxton House for a\r\nreception, called on all her faithful coadjutors to arouse enthusiasm in\r\nthe work, and climbed up to the sanctums of the editors,--Democratic and\r\nRepublican alike,--asking them to advertise the convention and to say a\r\nkind word for our oppressed class in our struggle for emancipation. They\r\nall promised favorable notices and comments, and they kept their\r\npromises. Mrs. Colby, being president of the Nebraska Suffrage\r\nAssociation, opened the meeting with an able speech, and presided\r\nthroughout with tact and dignity.\r\n\r\nI came very near meeting with an unfortunate experience at this\r\nconvention. The lady who escorted me in her carriage to the Opera House\r\ncarried the manuscript of my speech, which I did not miss until it was\r\nnearly time to speak, when I told a lady who sat by my side that our\r\nfriend had forgotten to give me my manuscript. She went at once to her\r\nand asked for it. She remembered taking it, but what she had done with\r\nit she did not know. It was suggested that she might have dropped it in\r\nalighting from the carriage. And lo! they found it lying in the gutter.\r\nAs the ground was frozen hard it was not even soiled. When I learned of\r\nmy narrow escape, I trembled, for I had not prepared any train of\r\nthought for extemporaneous use. I should have been obliged to talk when\r\nmy turn came, and if inspired by the audience or the good angels, might\r\nhave done well, or might have failed utterly. The moral of this episode\r\nis, hold on to your manuscript.\r\n\r\nOwing to the illness of my son-in-law, Frank E. Lawrence, he and my\r\ndaughter went to California to see if the balmy air of San Diego would\r\nrestore his health, and so we gave up housekeeping in Omaha, and, on\r\nApril 20, 1889, in company with my eldest son I returned East and spent\r\nthe summer at Hempstead, Long Island, with my son Gerrit and his wife.\r\n\r\nWe found Hempstead a quiet, old Dutch town, undisturbed by progressive\r\nideas. Here I made the acquaintance of Chauncey C. Parsons and wife,\r\nformerly of Boston, who were liberal in their ideas on most questions.\r\nMrs. Parsons and I attended one of the Seidl club meetings at Coney\r\nIsland, where Seidl was then giving some popular concerts. The club was\r\ncomposed of two hundred women, to whom I spoke for an hour in the dining\r\nroom of the hotel. With the magnificent ocean views, the grand concerts,\r\nand the beautiful women, I passed two very charming days by the seaside.\r\n\r\nMy son Henry had given me a phaeton, low and easy as a cradle, and I\r\nenjoyed many drives about Long Island. We went to Bryant's home on the\r\nnorth side, several times, and in imagination I saw the old poet in the\r\nvarious shady nooks, inditing his lines of love and praise of nature in\r\nall her varying moods. Walking among the many colored, rustling leaves\r\nin the dark days of November, I could easily enter into his thought as\r\nhe penned these lines:\r\n\r\n    \"The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year,\r\n    Of wailing winds, and naked woods, and meadows brown and sear.\r\n    Heaped in the hollows of the grove, the autumn leaves lie dead;\r\n    They rustle to the eddying gust, and to the rabbit's tread.\"\r\n\r\nIn September, 1889, my daughter, Mrs. Stanton Lawrence, came East to\r\nattend a school of physical culture, and my other daughter, Mrs. Stanton\r\nBlatch, came from England to enjoy one of our bracing winters.\r\nUnfortunately we had rain instead of snow, and fogs instead of frost.\r\nHowever, we had a pleasant reunion at Hempstead. After a few days in and\r\nabout New York visiting friends, we went to Geneva and spent several\r\nweeks in the home of my cousin, the daughter of Gerrit Smith.\r\n\r\nShe and I have been most faithful, devoted friends all our lives, and\r\nregular correspondents for more than fifty years. In the family circle\r\nwe are ofttimes referred to as \"Julius\" and \"Johnson.\" These euphonious\r\nnames originated in this way: When the Christy Minstrels first appeared,\r\nwe went one evening to hear them. On returning home we amused our\r\nseniors with, as they said, a capital rehearsal. The wit and philosopher\r\nof the occasion were called, respectively, Julius and Johnson; so we\r\ntook their parts and reproduced all the bright, humorous remarks they\r\nmade. The next morning as we appeared at the breakfast table, Cousin\r\nGerrit Smith, in his deep, rich voice said: \"Good-morning, Julius and\r\nJohnson,\" and he kept it up the few days we were in Albany together. One\r\nafter another our relatives adopted the pseudonyms, and Mrs. Miller has\r\nbeen \"Julius\" and I \"Johnson\" ever since.\r\n\r\nFrom Geneva we went to Buffalo, but, as I had a bad cold and a general\r\nfeeling of depression, I decided to go to the Dansville Sanatorium and\r\nsee what Doctors James and Kate Jackson could do for me. I was there six\r\nweeks and tried all the rubbings, pinchings, steamings; the Swedish\r\nmovements of the arms, hands, legs, feet; dieting, massage, electricity,\r\nand, though I succeeded in throwing off only five pounds of flesh, yet I\r\nfelt like a new being. It is a charming place to be in--the home is\r\npleasantly situated and the scenery very fine. The physicians are all\r\ngenial, and a cheerful atmosphere pervades the whole establishment.\r\n\r\nAs Christmas was at hand, the women were all half crazy about presents,\r\nand while good Doctors James and Kate were doing all in their power to\r\ncure the nervous affections of their patients, they would thwart the\r\ntreatment by sitting in the parlor with the thermometer at seventy-two\r\ndegrees, embroidering all kinds of fancy patterns,--some on muslin, some\r\non satin, and some with colored worsteds on canvas,--inhaling the\r\npoisonous dyes, straining the optic nerves, counting threads and\r\nstitches, hour after hour, until utterly exhausted. I spoke to one poor\r\nvictim of the fallacy of Christmas presents, and of her injuring her\r\nhealth in such useless employment. \"What can I do?\" she replied, \"I must\r\nmake presents and cannot afford to buy them.\" \"Do you think,\" said I,\r\n\"any of your friends would enjoy a present you made at the risk of your\r\nhealth? I do not think there is any 'must' in the matter. I never feel\r\nthat I must give presents, and never want any, especially from those who\r\nmake some sacrifice to give them.\" This whole custom of presents at\r\nChristmas, New Year's, and at weddings has come to be a bore, a piece of\r\nhypocrisy leading to no end of unhappiness. I do not know a more pitiful\r\nsight than to see a woman tatting, knitting, embroidering--working cats\r\non the toe of some slipper, or tulips on an apron. The amount of nervous\r\nforce that is expended in this way is enough to make angels weep. The\r\nnecessary stitches to be taken in every household are quite enough\r\nwithout adding fancy work.\r\n\r\nFrom Dansville my daughters and I went on to Washington to celebrate the\r\nseventieth birthday of Miss Anthony, who has always been to them as a\r\nsecond mother. Mrs. Blatch made a speech at the celebration, and Mrs.\r\nLawrence gave a recitation. First came a grand supper at the Riggs\r\nHouse. The dining room was beautifully decorated; in fact, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nSpofford spared no pains to make the occasion one long to be remembered.\r\nMay Wright Sewall was the mistress of ceremonies. She read the toasts\r\nand called on the different speakers. Phoebe Couzins, Rev. Anna Shaw,\r\nIsabella Beecher Hooker, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Clara B. Colby, Senator\r\nBlair of New Hampshire, and many others responded. I am ashamed to say\r\nthat we kept up the festivities till after two o'clock. Miss Anthony,\r\ndressed in dark velvet and point lace, spoke at the close with great\r\npathos. Those of us who were there will not soon forget February 15,\r\n1890.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking before committees of the Senate and House, I gave the\r\nopening address at the annual convention. Mrs. Stanton Blatch spoke a\r\nfew minutes on the suffrage movement in England, after which we hurried\r\noff to New York, and went on board the _Aller_, one of the North German\r\nLloyd steamers, bound for Southampton. At the ship we found Captain\r\nMilinowski and his wife and two of my sons waiting our arrival. As we\r\nhad eighteen pieces of baggage it took Mrs. Blatch some time to review\r\nthem. My phaeton, which we decided to take, filled six boxes. An easy\r\ncarriage for two persons is not common in England. The dogcarts prevail,\r\nthe most uncomfortable vehicles one can possibly use. Why some of our\r\nAmericans drive in those uncomfortable carts is a question. I think it\r\nis because they are \"so English.\" The only reason the English use them\r\nis because they are cheap. The tax on two wheels is one-half what it is\r\non four, and in England all carriages are taxed. Before we Americans\r\nadopt fashions because they are English, we had better find out the\r\n_raison d'être_ for their existence.\r\n\r\nWe had a very pleasant, smooth voyage, unusually so for blustering\r\nFebruary and March. As I dislike close staterooms, I remained in the\r\nladies' saloon night and day, sleeping on a sofa. After a passage of\r\neleven days we landed at Southampton, March 2, 1890. It was a beautiful\r\nmoonlight night and we had a pleasant ride on the little tug to the\r\nwharf. We reached Basingstoke at eleven o'clock, found the family well\r\nand all things in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nMY LAST VISIT TO ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as we got our carriage put together Hattie and I drove out every\r\nday, as the roads in England are in fine condition all the year round.\r\nWe had lovely weather during the spring, but the summer was wet and\r\ncold. With reading, writing, going up to London, and receiving visitors,\r\nthe months flew by without our accomplishing half the work we proposed.\r\n\r\nAs my daughter was a member of the Albemarle Club, we invited several\r\nfriends to dine with us there at different times. There we had a long\r\ntalk with Mr. Stead, the editor of the _Pall Mall Gazette_, on his\r\nposition in regard to Russian affairs, \"The Deceased Wife's Sister\r\nBill,\" and the divorce laws of England. Mr. Stead is a fluent talker as\r\nwell as a good writer. He is the leader of the social purity movement in\r\nEngland. The wisdom of his course toward Sir Charles Dilke and Mr.\r\nParnell was questioned by many; but there is a touch of the religious\r\nfanatic in Mr. Stead, as in many of his followers.\r\n\r\nThere were several problems in social ethics that deeply stirred the\r\nEnglish people in the year of our Lord 1890. One was Charles Stewart\r\nParnell's platonic friendship with Mrs. O'Shea, and the other was the\r\nLord Chancellor's decision in the case of Mrs. Jackson. The pulpit, the\r\npress, and the people vied with each other in trying to dethrone Mr.\r\nParnell as the great Irish leader, but the united forces did not succeed\r\nin destroying his self-respect, nor in hounding him out of the British\r\nParliament, though, after a brave and protracted resistance on his part,\r\nthey did succeed in hounding him into the grave.\r\n\r\nIt was pitiful to see the Irish themselves, misled by a hypocritical\r\npopular sentiment in England, turn against their great leader, the only\r\none they had had for half a century who was able to keep the Irish\r\nquestion uppermost in the House of Commons year after year. The course\r\nof events since his death has proved the truth of what he told them, to\r\nwit: that there was no sincerity in the interest English politicians\r\nmanifested in the question of Home Rule, and that the debates on that\r\npoint would cease as soon as it was no longer forced on their\r\nconsideration. And now when they have succeeded in killing their leader,\r\nthey begin to realize their loss. The question evolved through the\r\nferment of social opinions was concisely stated, thus: \"Can a man be a\r\ngreat leader, a statesman, a general, an admiral, a learned chief\r\njustice, a trusted lawyer, or skillful physician, if he has ever broken\r\nthe Seventh Commandment?\"\r\n\r\nI expressed my opinion in the _Westminster Review_, at the time, in the\r\naffirmative. Mrs. Jacob Bright, Mrs. Ellen Battelle Dietrick of Boston,\r\nKate Field, in her _Washington_, agreed with me. Many other women spoke\r\nout promptly in the negative, and with a bitterness against those who\r\ntook the opposite view that was lamentable.\r\n\r\nThe Jackson case was a profitable study, as it brought out other\r\nquestions of social ethics, as well as points of law which were ably\r\nsettled by the Lord Chancellor. It seems that immediately after Mr. and\r\nMrs. Jackson were married, the groom was compelled to go to Australia.\r\nAfter two years he returned and claimed his bride, but in the interval\r\nshe felt a growing aversion and determined not to live with him. As she\r\nwould not even see him, with the assistance of friends he kidnaped her\r\none day as she was coming out of church, and carried her to his home,\r\nwhere he kept her under surveillance until her friends, with a writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_, compelled him to bring her into court. The popular idea\r\n\"based on the common law of England,\" was, that the husband had this\r\nabsolute right. The lower court, in harmony with this idea, maintained\r\nthe husband's right, and remanded her to his keeping, but the friends\r\nappealed to the higher court and the Lord Chancellor reversed the\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the right so frequently claimed, giving husbands the\r\npower to seize, imprison, and chastise their wives, he said: \"I am of\r\nthe opinion that no such right exists in law. I am of the opinion that\r\nno such right ever did exist in law. I say that no English subject has\r\nthe right to imprison another English subject, whether his wife or not.\"\r\nThrough this decision the wife walked out of the court a free woman. The\r\npassage of the Married Women's Property Bill in England in 1882 was the\r\nfirst blow at the old idea of coverture, giving to wives their rights of\r\nproperty, the full benefit of which they are yet to realize when\r\nclearer-minded men administer the laws. The decision of the Lord\r\nChancellor, rendered March 18, 1891, declaratory of the personal rights\r\nof married women, is a still more important blow by just so much as the\r\nrights of person are more sacred than the rights of property.\r\n\r\nOne hundred years ago, Lord Chief Justice Mansfield gave his famous\r\ndecision in the Somerset case, \"That no slave could breathe on British\r\nsoil,\" and the slave walked out of court a free man. The decision of the\r\nLord Chancellor, in the Jackson case, is far more important, more\r\nmomentous in its consequences, as it affects not only one race but\r\none-half of the entire human family. From every point of view this is\r\nthe greatest legal decision of the century. Like the great Chief Justice\r\nof the last century, the Lord Chancellor, with a clearer vision than\r\nthose about him, rises into a purer atmosphere of thought, and\r\nvindicates the eternal principles of justice and the dignity of British\r\nlaw, by declaring all statutes that make wives the bond slaves of their\r\nhusbands, obsolete.\r\n\r\nHow long will it be in our Republic before some man will arise, great\r\nenough to so interpret our National Constitution as to declare that\r\nwomen, as citizens of the United States, cannot be governed by laws in\r\nthe making of which they have no part? It is not Constitutional\r\namendments nor statute laws we need, but judges on the bench of our\r\nSupreme Court, who, in deciding great questions of human rights, shall\r\nbe governed by the broad principles of justice rather than precedent.\r\nOne interesting feature in the trial of the Jackson case, was that both\r\nLady Coleridge and the wife of the Lord Chancellor were seated on the\r\nbench, and evidently much pleased with the decision.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to account for the fact that, while women of the highest\r\nclasses in England take the deepest interest in politics and court\r\ndecisions, American women of wealth and position are wholly indifferent\r\nto all public matters. While English women take an active part in\r\nelections, holding meetings and canvassing their districts, here, even\r\nthe wives of judges, governors, and senators speak with bated breath of\r\npolitical movements, and seem to feel that a knowledge of laws and\r\nconstitutions would hopelessly unsex them.\r\n\r\nToward the last of April, with my little granddaughter and her nurse, I\r\nwent down to Bournemouth, one of the most charming watering places in\r\nEngland. We had rooms in the Cliff House with windows opening on the\r\nbalcony, where we had a grand view of the bay and could hear the waves\r\ndashing on the shore. While Nora, with her spade and pail, played all\r\nday in the sands, digging trenches and filling them with water, I sat on\r\nthe balcony reading \"Diana of the Crossways,\" and Bjornson's last novel,\r\n\"In God's Way,\" both deeply interesting. As all the characters in the\r\nlatter come to a sad end, I could not see the significance of the title.\r\nIf they walked in God's way their career should have been successful.\r\n\r\nI took my first airing along the beach in an invalid chair. These bath\r\nchairs are a great feature in all the watering places of England. They\r\nare drawn by a man or a donkey. The first day I took a man, an old\r\nsailor, who talked incessantly of his adventures, stopping to rest every\r\nfive minutes, dissipating all my pleasant reveries, and making an\r\nunendurable bore of himself. The next day I told the proprietor to get\r\nme a man who would not talk all the time. The man he supplied jogged\r\nalong in absolute silence; he would not even answer my questions.\r\nSupposing he had his orders to keep profound silence, after one or two\r\nattempts I said nothing. When I returned home, the proprietor asked me\r\nhow I liked this man. \"Ah!\" I said, \"he was indeed silent and would not\r\neven answer a question nor go anywhere I told him; still I liked him\r\nbetter than the talkative man.\" He laughed heartily and said: \"This man\r\nis deaf and dumb. I thought I would make sure that you should not be\r\nbored.\" I joined in the laugh and said: \"Well, to-morrow get me a man\r\nwho can hear but cannot speak, if you can find one constructed on that\r\nplan.\"\r\n\r\nBournemouth is noteworthy now as the burial place of Mary Wolstonecraft\r\nand the Shelleys. I went to see the monument that had been recently\r\nreared to their memory. On one side is the following inscription:\r\n\"William Godwin, author of 'Political Justice,' born March 3rd, 1756,\r\ndied April 7th, 1836. Mary Wolstonecraft Godwin, author of the\r\n'Vindication of the Rights of Women,' born April 27th, 1759, died\r\nSeptember 10th, 1797.\" These remains were brought here, in 1851, from\r\nthe churchyard of St. Pancras, London. On the other side are the\r\nfollowing inscriptions: \"Mary Wolstonecraft Godwin, daughter of William\r\nGodwin and widow of the late Percy Bysshe Shelley, born August 30th,\r\n1797, died February 1st, 1851. Percy Florence Shelley, son of Percy\r\nShelley and Mary Wolstonecraft, third baronet, born November 12th, 1819,\r\ndied December 5th, 1889. \"In Christ's Church, six miles from\r\nBournemouth, is a bas-relief in memory of the great poet. He is\r\nrepresented, dripping with seaweed, in the arms of the Angel of Death.\r\n\r\nAs I sat on my balcony hour after hour, reading and thinking of the\r\nShelleys, watching the changing hues of the clouds and the beautiful\r\nbay, and listening to the sad monotone of the waves, these sweet lines\r\nof Whittier's came to my mind:\r\n\r\n    \"Its waves are kneeling on the strand,\r\n     As kneels the human knee,--\r\n    Their white locks bowing to the sand,\r\n     The priesthood of the sea!\r\n\r\n    \"The blue sky is the temple's arch,\r\n     Its transept earth and air,\r\n    The music of its starry march\r\n     The chorus of a prayer.\"\r\n\r\nAmerican letters, during this sojourn abroad, told of many losses, one\r\nafter another, from our family circle; nine passed away within two\r\nyears. The last was my sister Mrs. Bayard, who died in May, 1891. She\r\nwas the oldest of our family, and had always been a second mother to her\r\nyounger sisters, and her house our second home.\r\n\r\nThe last of June my son Theodore's wife and daughter came over from\r\nFrance to spend a month with us. Lisette and Nora, about the same size,\r\nplayed and quarreled most amusingly together. They spent their mornings\r\nin the kindergarten school, and the afternoons with their pony, but\r\nrainy days I was impressed into their service to dress dolls and tell\r\nstories. I had the satisfaction to hear them say that their dolls were\r\nnever so prettily dressed before, and that my stories were better than\r\nany in the books. As I composed the wonderful yarns as I went along, I\r\nused to get very tired, and sometimes, when I heard the little feet\r\ncoming, I would hide, but they would hunt until they found me. When my\r\nyoungest son was ten years old and could read for himself, I graduated\r\nin story telling, having practiced in that line twenty-one years. I\r\nvowed that I would expend no more breath in that direction, but the\r\neager face of a child asking for stories is too much for me, and my vow\r\nhas been often broken. All the time I was in England Nora claimed the\r\ntwilight hour, and, in France, Lisette was equally pertinacious. When\r\nVictor Hugo grew tired telling his grandchildren stories, he would wind\r\nup with the story of an old gentleman who, after a few interesting\r\nexperiences, took up his evening paper and began to read aloud. The\r\nchildren would listen a few moments and then, one by one, slip out of\r\nthe room. Longfellow's old gentleman, after many exciting scenes in his\r\ncareer, usually stretched himself on the lounge and feigned sleep. But\r\ngrandmothers are not allowed to shelter themselves with such devices;\r\nthey are required to spin on until the bedtime really arrives.\r\n\r\nOn July 16, one of the hottest days of the season, Mrs. Jacob Bright and\r\ndaughter, Herbert Burroughs, and Mrs. Parkhurst came down from London,\r\nand we sat out of doors, taking our luncheon under the trees and\r\ndiscussing theosophy. Later in the month Hattie and I went to Yorkshire\r\nto visit Mr. and Mrs. Scatcherd at Morley Hall, and there spent several\r\ndays. We had a prolonged discussion on personal rights. One side was\r\nagainst all governmental interference, such as compulsory education and\r\nthe protection of children against cruel parents; the other side in\r\nfavor of state interference that protected the individual in the\r\nenjoyment of life, liberty, and happiness. I took the latter position.\r\nMany parents are not fit to have the control of children, hence the\r\nState should see that they are sheltered, fed, clothed, and educated. It\r\nis far better for the State to make good citizens of its children in\r\nthe beginning, than, in the end, to be compelled to care for them as\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\nWhile in the north of England we spent a few days at Howard Castle, the\r\nsummer residence of Lord and Lady Carlisle and their ten children. So\r\nlarge a family in high life is unusual. As I had known Lord and Lady\r\nAmberley in America, when they visited this country in 1867, I enjoyed\r\nmeeting other members of their family. Lady Carlisle is in favor of\r\nwoman suffrage and frequently speaks in public. She is a woman of great\r\nforce of character, and of very generous impulses. She is trying to do\r\nher duty in sharing the good things of life with the needy. The poor for\r\nmiles round often have picnics in her park, and large numbers of\r\nchildren from manufacturing towns spend weeks with her cottage tenants\r\nat her expense. Lord Carlisle is an artist and a student. As he has a\r\npoetical temperament and is aesthetic in all his tastes, Lady Carlisle\r\nis the business manager of the estate. She is a practical woman with\r\nimmense executive ability. The castle with its spacious dining hall and\r\ndrawing rooms, with its chapel, library, galleries of paintings and\r\nstatuary, its fine outlook, extensive gardens and lawns was well worth\r\nseeing. We enjoyed our visit very much and discussed every imaginable\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to Basingstoke we had a visit from Mrs. Cobb, the wife\r\nof a member of Parliament, and sister-in-law of Karl Pearson, whose\r\nlectures on woman I had enjoyed so much. It was through reading his\r\nwork, \"The Ethic of Free Thought,\" that the Matriarchate made such a\r\ndeep impression on my mind and moved me to write a tract on the subject.\r\nPeople who have neither read nor thought on this point, question the\r\nfacts as stated by Bachofen, Morgan, and Wilkeson; but their truth, I\r\nthink, cannot be questioned. They seem so natural in the chain of\r\nreasoning and the progress of human development. Mrs. Cobb did a very\r\ngood thing a few days before visiting us. At a great meeting called to\r\npromote Mr. Cobb's election, John Morley spoke. He did not even say\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen\" in starting, nor make the slightest reference to\r\nthe existence of such beings as women. When he had finished, Mrs. Cobb\r\narose mid great cheering and criticised his speech, making some\r\nquotations from his former speeches of a very liberal nature. The\r\naudience laughed and cheered, fully enjoying the rebuke. The next day in\r\nhis speech he remembered his countrywomen, and on rising said, \"Ladies\r\nand gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nDuring August, 1891, I was busy getting ready for my voyage, as I was to\r\nsail on the _Ems_ on August 23. Although I had crossed the ocean six\r\ntimes in the prior ten years I dreaded the voyage more than words can\r\ndescribe. The last days were filled with sadness, in parting with those\r\nso dear to me in foreign countries--especially those curly-headed little\r\ngirls, so bright, so pretty, so winning in all their ways. Hattie and\r\nTheodore went with me from Southampton in the little tug to the great\r\nship _Ems_. It was very hard for us to say the last farewell, but we all\r\ntried to be as brave as possible.\r\n\r\nWe had a rough voyage, but I was not seasick one moment. I was up and\r\ndressed early in the morning, and on deck whenever the weather\r\npermitted. I made many pleasant acquaintances with whom I played chess\r\nand whist; wrote letters to all my foreign friends, ready to mail on\r\nlanding; read the \"Egotist,\" by George Meredith, and Ibsen's plays as\r\ntranslated by my friend Frances Lord. I had my own private stewardess, a\r\nnice German woman who could speak English. She gave me most of my meals\r\non deck or in the ladies' saloon, and at night she would open the\r\nporthole two or three times and air our stateroom; that made the nights\r\nendurable. The last evening before landing we got up an entertainment\r\nwith songs, recitations, readings, and speeches. I was invited to\r\npreside and introduce the various performers. We reached Sandy Hook the\r\nevening of the 29th day of August and lay there all night, and the next\r\nmorning we sailed up our beautiful harbor, brilliant with the rays of\r\nthe rising sun.\r\n\r\nBeing fortunate in having children in both hemispheres, here, too, I\r\nfound a son and daughter waiting to welcome me to my native land. Our\r\nchief business for many weeks was searching for an inviting apartment\r\nwhere my daughter, Mrs. Stanton Lawrence, my youngest son, Bob, and I\r\ncould set up our family altar and sing our new psalm of life together.\r\nAfter much weary searching we found an apartment. Having always lived in\r\na large house in the country, the quarters seemed rather contracted at\r\nfirst, but I soon realized the immense saving in labor and expense in\r\nhaving no more room than is absolutely necessary, and all on one floor.\r\nTo be transported from the street to your apartment in an elevator in\r\nhalf a minute, to have all your food and fuel sent to your kitchen by an\r\nelevator in the rear, to have your rooms all warmed with no effort of\r\nyour own, seemed like a realization of some fairy dream. With an\r\nextensive outlook of the heavens above, of the Park and the Boulevard\r\nbeneath, I had a feeling of freedom, and with a short flight of stairs\r\nto the roof (an easy escape in case of fire), of safety, too.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was I fully established in my eyrie, than I was summoned to\r\nRochester, by my friend Miss Anthony, to fill an appointment she had\r\nmade for me with Miss Adelaide Johnson, the artist from Washington, who\r\nwas to idealize Miss Anthony and myself in marble for the World's Fair.\r\nI found my friend demurely seated in her mother's rocking-chair hemming\r\ntable linen and towels for her new home, anon bargaining with butchers,\r\nbakers, and grocers, making cakes and puddings, talking with enthusiasm\r\nof palatable dishes and the beauties of various articles of furniture\r\nthat different friends had presented her. All there was to remind one of\r\nthe \"Napoleon of the Suffrage Movement\" was a large escritoire covered\r\nwith documents in the usual state of confusion--Miss Anthony never could\r\nkeep her papers in order. In search of any particular document she roots\r\nout every drawer and pigeon hole, although her mother's little spinning\r\nwheel stands right beside her desk, a constant reminder of all the\r\ndomestic virtues of the good housewife, with whom \"order\" is of the\r\nutmost importance and \"heaven's first law.\" The house was exquisitely\r\nclean and orderly, the food appetizing, the conversation pleasant and\r\nprofitable, and the atmosphere genial.\r\n\r\nA room in an adjoining house was assigned to Miss Johnson and myself,\r\nwhere a strong pedestal and huge mass of clay greeted us. And there, for\r\nnearly a month, I watched the transformation of that clay into human\r\nproportions and expressions, until it gradually emerged with the\r\nfamiliar facial outlines ever so dear to one's self. Sitting there four\r\nor five hours every day I used to get very sleepy, so my artist\r\narranged for a series of little naps. When she saw the crisis coming she\r\nwould say: \"I will work now for a time on the ear, the nose, or the\r\nhair, as you must be wide awake when I am trying to catch the\r\nexpression.\" I rewarded her for her patience and indulgence by summoning\r\nup, when awake, the most intelligent and radiant expression that I could\r\ncommand. As Miss Johnson is a charming, cultured woman, with liberal\r\nideas and brilliant in conversation, she readily drew out all that was\r\nbest in me.\r\n\r\nBefore I left Rochester, Miss Anthony and her sister Mary gave a\r\nreception to me at their house. As some of the professors and trustees\r\nof the Rochester University were there, the question of co-education was\r\nfreely discussed, and the authorities urged to open the doors of the\r\nUniversity to the daughters of the people. It was rather aggravating to\r\ncontemplate those fine buildings and grounds, while every girl in that\r\ncity must go abroad for higher education. The wife of President Hill of\r\nthe University had just presented him with twins, a girl and a boy, and\r\nhe facetiously remarked, \"that if the Creator could risk placing sexes\r\nin such near relations, he thought they might with safety walk on the\r\nsame campus and pursue the same curriculum together.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony and I went to Geneva the next day to visit Mrs. Miller and\r\nto meet, by appointment, Mrs. Eliza Osborne, the niece of Lucretia Mott,\r\nand eldest daughter of Martha C. Wright. We anticipated a merry meeting,\r\nbut Miss Anthony and I were so tired that we no doubt appeared stupid.\r\nIn a letter to Mrs. Miller afterward, Mrs. Osborne inquired why I was\r\n\"so solemn.\" As I pride myself on being impervious to fatigue or\r\ndisease, I could not own up to any disability, so I turned the tables on\r\nher in the following letter:\r\n\r\n     \"New York, 26 West 61st Street,\r\n\r\n     November 12, 1891.\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Eliza:\r\n\r\n     \"In a recent letter to Mrs. Miller, speaking of the time when we\r\n     last met, you say, 'Why was Mrs. Stanton so solemn?' to which I\r\n     reply: Ever since an old German emperor issued an edict, ordering\r\n     all the women under that flag to knit when walking on the highway,\r\n     when selling apples in the market place, when sitting in the parks,\r\n     because 'to keep women out of mischief their hands must be busy,'\r\n     ever since I read that, I have felt 'solemn' whenever I have seen\r\n     any daughters of our grand Republic knitting, tatting,\r\n     embroidering, or occupied with any of the ten thousand digital\r\n     absurdities that fill so large a place in the lives of Eve's\r\n     daughters.\r\n\r\n     \"Looking forward to the scintillations of wit, the philosophical\r\n     researches, the historical traditions, the scientific discoveries,\r\n     the astronomical explorations, the mysteries of theosophy,\r\n     palmistry, mental science, the revelations of the unknown world\r\n     where angels and devils do congregate, looking forward to\r\n     discussions of all these grand themes, in meeting the eldest\r\n     daughter of David and Martha Wright, the niece of Lucretia Mott,\r\n     the sister-in-law of William Lloyd Garrison, a queenly-looking\r\n     woman five feet eight in height, and well proportioned, with\r\n     glorious black eyes, rivaling even De Staël's in power and pathos,\r\n     one can readily imagine the disappointment I experienced when such\r\n     a woman pulled a cotton wash rag from her pocket and forthwith\r\n     began to knit with bowed head. Fixing her eyes and concentrating\r\n     her thoughts on a rag one foot square; it was impossible for\r\n     conversation to rise above the wash-rag level! It was enough to\r\n     make the most aged optimist 'solemn' to see such a wreck of\r\n     glorious womanhood.\r\n\r\n     \"And, still worse, she not only knit steadily, hour after hour, but\r\n     she bestowed the sweetest words of encouragement on a young girl\r\n     from the Pacific Coast, who was embroidering rosebuds on another\r\n     rag, the very girl I had endeavored to rescue from the maelstrom of\r\n     embroidery, by showing her the unspeakable folly of giving her\r\n     optic nerves to such base uses, when they were designed by the\r\n     Creator to explore the planetary world, with chart and compass to\r\n     guide mighty ships across the sea, to lead the sons of Adam with\r\n     divinest love from earth to heaven. Think of the great beseeching\r\n     optic nerves and muscles by which we express our admiration of all\r\n     that is good and glorious in earth and heaven, being concentrated\r\n     on a cotton wash rag! Who can wonder that I was 'solemn' that day!\r\n     I made my agonized protest on the spot, but it fell unheeded, and\r\n     with satisfied sneer Eliza knit on, and the young Californian\r\n     continued making the rosebuds. I gazed into space, and, when alone,\r\n     wept for my degenerate countrywoman. I not only was 'solemn' that\r\n     day, but I am profoundly 'solemn' whenever I think of that queenly\r\n     woman and that cotton wash rag. (One can buy a whole dozen of these\r\n     useful appliances, with red borders and fringed, for twenty-five\r\n     cents.) Oh, Eliza, I beseech you, knit no more!\r\n\r\n     \"Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n     \"Elizabeth Cady Stanton.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Mrs. Osborne sent the following reply:\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Mrs. Stanton:\r\n\r\n     \"In your skit\r\n    Against your sisterhood who knit,\r\n     Or useful make their fingers,\r\n    I wonder if--deny it not--\r\n    The habit of Lucretia Mott\r\n     Within your memory lingers!\r\n\r\n    \"In retrospective vision bright,\r\n    Can you recall dear Martha Wright\r\n     Without her work or knitting?\r\n    The needles flying in her hands,\r\n    On washing rags or baby's bands,\r\n     Or other work as fitting?\r\n\r\n    \"I cannot think they thought the less,\r\n    Or ceased the company to bless\r\n     With conversation's riches,\r\n    Because they thus improved their time,\r\n    And never deemed it was a crime\r\n     To fill the hours with stitches.\r\n\r\n    \"They even used to preach and plan\r\n    To spread the fashion, so that man\r\n     Might have this satisfaction;\r\n    Instead of idling as men do,\r\n    With nervous meddling fingers too,\r\n     Why not mate talk with action?\r\n\r\n    \"But as a daughter and a niece,\r\n    I pride myself on every piece\r\n     Of handiwork created;\r\n    While reveling in social chat,\r\n    Or listening to gossip flat,\r\n     My gain is unabated.\r\n\r\n    \"That German emperor you scorn,\r\n    Seems to my mind a monarch born,\r\n     Worthy to lead a column;\r\n    I'll warrant he could talk and work,\r\n    And, neither being used to shirk,\r\n     Was rarely very solemn.\r\n\r\n    \"I could say more upon this head,\r\n    But must, before I go to bed.\r\n     Your idle precepts mocking,\r\n    Get out my needle and my yarn\r\n    And, caring not a single darn.\r\n     Just finish up this stocking.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nSIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLASS OF 1832--THE WOMAN'S BIBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI returned from Geneva to New York city in time to celebrate my\r\nseventy-sixth birthday with my children. I had traveled about constantly\r\nfor the last twenty years in France, England, and my own country, and\r\nhad so many friends and correspondents, and pressing invitations to\r\nspeak in clubs and conventions, that now I decided to turn over a new\r\nleaf and rest in an easy-chair. But so complete a change in one's life\r\ncould not be easily accomplished. In spite of my resolution to abide in\r\nseclusion, my daughter and I were induced to join the Botta Club, which\r\nwas to meet once a month, alternately, at the residences of Mrs. Moncure\r\nD. Conway and Mrs. Abby Sage Richardson. Though composed of ladies and\r\ngentlemen it proved dull and unprofitable. As the subject for discussion\r\nwas not announced until each meeting, no one was prepared with any\r\nwell-digested train of thought. It was also decided to avoid all\r\nquestions about which there might be grave differences of opinion. This\r\nnegative position reminded me of a book on etiquette which I read in my\r\nyoung days, in which gentlemen were warned, \"In the presence of ladies\r\ndiscuss neither politics, religion, nor social duties, but confine\r\nyourself to art, poetry, and abstract questions which women cannot\r\nunderstand. The less they know of a subject the more respectfully they\r\nwill listen.\" This club was named in honor of Mrs. Botta, formerly Miss\r\nAnne Lynch, whose drawing room for many years was the social center of\r\nthe literati of New York.\r\n\r\nOn January 16, 1892, we held the Annual Suffrage Convention in\r\nWashington, and, as usual, had a hearing before the Congressional\r\nCommittee. My speech on the \"Solitude of Self\" was well received and was\r\npublished in the Congressional Record. The _Woman's Tribune_ struck off\r\nmany hundreds of copies and it was extensively circulated.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my determination to rest, I spoke to many clubs, wrote\r\narticles for papers and magazines, and two important leaflets, one on\r\n\"Street Cleaning,\" another on \"Opening the Chicago Exposition on\r\nSunday.\" As Sunday was the only day the masses could visit that\r\nmagnificent scene, with its great lake, extensive park, artificial\r\ncanals, and beautiful buildings, I strongly advocated its being open on\r\nthat day. One hundred thousand religious bigots petitioned Congress to\r\nmake no appropriation for this magnificent Exposition, unless the\r\nmanagers pledged themselves to close the gates on Sunday, and hide this\r\nvision of beauty from the common people. Fortunately, this time a sense\r\nof justice outweighed religious bigotry. I sent my leaflets to every\r\nmember of Congress and of the State legislatures, and to the managers of\r\nthe Exposition, and made it a topic of conversation at every\r\nopportunity. The park and parts of the Exposition were kept open on\r\nSunday, but some of the machinery was stopped as a concession to narrow\r\nChristian sects.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1892, at the earnest solicitation of Mrs. Russell Sage, I\r\nattended the dedication of the Gurley Memorial Building, presented to\r\nthe Emma Willard Seminary, at Troy, New York, and made the following\r\naddress:\r\n\r\n     \"MRS. PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF THE ALUMNAE:\r\n\r\n     \"It is just sixty years since the class of '32, to which I\r\n     belonged, celebrated a commencement in this same room. This was the\r\n     great event of the season to many families throughout this State.\r\n     Parents came from all quarters; the _élite_ of Troy and Albany\r\n     assembled here. Principals from other schools, distinguished\r\n     legislators, and clergymen all came to hear girls scan Latin verse,\r\n     solve problems in Euclid, and read their own compositions in a\r\n     promiscuous assemblage. A long line of teachers anxiously waited\r\n     the calling of their classes, and over all, our queenly Madame\r\n     Willard presided with royal grace and dignity. Two hundred girls in\r\n     gala attire, white dresses, bright sashes, and coral ornaments,\r\n     with their curly hair, rosy cheeks, and sparkling eyes, flitted to\r\n     and fro, some rejoicing that they had passed through their ordeal,\r\n     some still on the tiptoe of expectation, some laughing, some in\r\n     tears--altogether a most beautiful and interesting picture.\r\n\r\n     \"Conservatives then, as now, thought the result of the higher\r\n     education of girls would be to destroy their delicacy and\r\n     refinement. But as the graduates of the Troy Seminary were never\r\n     distinguished in after life for the lack of these feminine virtues,\r\n     the most timid, even, gradually accepted the situation and trusted\r\n     their daughters with Mrs. Willard. But that noble woman endured for\r\n     a long period the same ridicule and persecution that women now do\r\n     who take an onward step in the march of progress.\r\n\r\n     \"I see around me none of the familiar faces that greeted my coming\r\n     or said farewell in parting. I do not know that one of my\r\n     classmates still lives. Friendship with those I knew and loved best\r\n     lasted but a few years, then our ways in life parted. I should not\r\n     know where to find one now, and if I did, probably our ideas would\r\n     differ on every subject, as I have wandered in latitudes beyond the\r\n     prescribed sphere of women. I suppose it is much the same with many\r\n     of you--the familiar faces are all gone, gone to the land of\r\n     shadows, and I hope of sunshine too, where we in turn will soon\r\n     follow. \"And yet, though we who are left are strangers to one\r\n     another, we have the same memories of the past, of the same type of\r\n     mischievous girls and staid teachers, though with different names.\r\n     The same long, bare halls and stairs, the recitation rooms with the\r\n     same old blackboards and lumps of chalk taken for generation after\r\n     generation, I suppose, from the same pit; the dining room, with its\r\n     pillars inconveniently near some of the tables, with its thick,\r\n     white crockery and black-handled knives, and viands that never\r\n     suited us, because, forsooth, we had boxes of delicacies from home,\r\n     or we had been out to the baker's or confectioner's and bought pies\r\n     and cocoanut cakes, candy and chewing gum, all forbidden, but that\r\n     added to the relish. There, too, were the music rooms, with their\r\n     old, second-hand pianos, some with rattling keys and tinny sound,\r\n     on which we were supposed to play our scales and exercises for an\r\n     hour, though we often slyly indulged in the 'Russian March,'\r\n     'Napoleon Crossing the Rhine,' or our national airs, when, as\r\n     slyly, Mr. Powell, our music teacher, a bumptious Englishman, would\r\n     softly open the door and say in a stern voice, 'Please practice the\r\n     lesson I just gave you!'\r\n\r\n     \"Our chief delight was to break the rules, but we did not like to\r\n     be caught at it. As we were forbidden to talk with our neighbors in\r\n     study hours, I frequently climbed on top of my bureau to talk\r\n     through a pipe hole with a daughter of Judge Howell of Canandaigua.\r\n     We often met afterward, laughed and talked over the old days, and\r\n     kept our friendship bright until the day of her death. Once while\r\n     rooming with Harriet Hudson, a sister of Mrs. John Willard, I was\r\n     moved to a very erratic performance. Miss Theresa Lee had rung the\r\n     bell for retiring, and had taken her rounds, as usual, to see that\r\n     the lights were out and all was still, when I peeped out of my\r\n     door, and seeing the bell at the head of the stairs nearby, I gave\r\n     it one kick and away it went rolling and ringing to the bottom. The\r\n     halls were instantly filled with teachers and scholars, all in\r\n     white robes, asking what was the matter. Harriet and I ran around\r\n     questioning the rest, and what a frolic we had, helter-skelter, up\r\n     and down stairs, in each other's rooms, pulling the beds to pieces,\r\n     changing girls' clothes from one room to another, etc., etc. The\r\n     hall lamps, dimly burning, gave us just light enough for all manner\r\n     of depredations without our being recognized, hence the unbounded\r\n     latitude we all felt for mischief. In our whole seminary\r\n     course--and I was there nearly three years--we never had such a\r\n     frolic as that night. It took all the teachers to restore order and\r\n     quiet us down again for the night. No suspicion of any\r\n     irregularities were ever attached to Harriet and myself. Our\r\n     standing for scholarship was good, hence we were supposed to\r\n     reflect all the moralities.\r\n\r\n     \"Though strangers, we have a bond of union in all these memories,\r\n     of our bright companions, our good teachers, who took us through\r\n     the pitfalls of logic, rhetoric, philosophy, and the sciences, and\r\n     of the noble woman who founded the institution, and whose unselfish\r\n     devotion in the cause of education we are here to celebrate. The\r\n     name of Emma Willard is dear to all of us; to know her was to love\r\n     and venerate her. She was not only good and gifted, but she was a\r\n     beautiful woman. She had a finely developed figure, well-shaped\r\n     head, classic features, most genial manners, and a profound\r\n     self-respect (a rare quality in woman), that gave her a dignity\r\n     truly royal in every position. Traveling in the Old World she was\r\n     noticed everywhere as a distinguished personage. And all these\r\n     gifts she dedicated to the earnest purpose of her life, the higher\r\n     education of women.\r\n\r\n     \"In opening this seminary she could not find young women capable of\r\n     teaching the higher branches, hence her first necessity was to\r\n     train herself. Amos B. Eaton, who was the principal of the\r\n     Rensselaer Polytechnic School for boys here in Troy, told me Mrs.\r\n     Willard studied with him every branch he was capable of teaching,\r\n     and trained a corps of teachers and regular scholars at the same\r\n     time. She took lessons of the Professor every evening when he had\r\n     leisure, and studied half the night the branches she was to teach\r\n     the next day, thus keeping ahead of her classes. Her intense\r\n     earnestness and mental grasp, the readiness with which she turned\r\n     from one subject to another, and her retentive memory of every rule\r\n     and fact he gave her, was a constant surprise to the Professor.\r\n\r\n     \"All her vacation she devoted to training teachers. She was the\r\n     first to suggest the normal-school system. Remembering her deep\r\n     interest in the education of women, we can honor her in no more\r\n     worthy manner than to carry on her special lifework. As we look\r\n     around at all the educated women assembled here to-day and try to\r\n     estimate what each has done in her own sphere of action, the\r\n     schools founded, the teachers sent forth, the inspiration given to\r\n     girls in general, through the long chain of influences started by\r\n     our alma mater, we can form some light estimate of the momentous\r\n     and far-reaching consequences of Emma Willard's life. We have not\r\n     her difficulties to overcome, her trials to endure, but the\r\n     imperative duty is laid on each of us to finish the work she so\r\n     successfully began. Schools and colleges of a high order are now\r\n     everywhere open to women, public sentiment welcomes them to\r\n     whatever career they may desire, and our work is to help worthy\r\n     girls struggling for a higher education, by founding scholarships\r\n     in desirable institutions in every State in the Union. The most\r\n     fitting tribute we can pay to Emma Willard is to aid in the\r\n     production of a generation of thoroughly educated women.\r\n\r\n     \"There are two kinds of scholarships, equally desirable; a\r\n     permanent one, where the interest of a fund from year to year will\r\n     support a succession of students, and a temporary one, to help some\r\n     worthy individual as she may require. Someone has suggested that\r\n     this association should help young girls in their primary\r\n     education. But as our public schools possess all the advantages for\r\n     a thorough education in the rudiments of learning and are free to\r\n     all, our scholarships should be bestowed on those whose ability and\r\n     earnestness in the primary department have been proved, and whose\r\n     capacity for a higher education is fully shown.\r\n\r\n     \"This is the best work women of wealth can do, and I hope in the\r\n     future they will endow scholarships for their own sex instead of\r\n     giving millions of dollars to institutions for boys, as they have\r\n     done in the past. After all the bequests women have made to Harvard\r\n     see how niggardly that institution, in its 'annex,' treats their\r\n     daughters. I once asked a wealthy lady to give a few thousands of\r\n     dollars to start a medical college and hospital for women in New\r\n     York. She said before making bequests she always consulted her\r\n     minister and her Bible. He told her there was nothing said in the\r\n     Bible about colleges for women. I said, 'Tell him he is mistaken.\r\n     If he will turn to 2 'Chron. xxxiv. 22, he will find that when\r\n     Josiah, the king, sent the wise men to consult Huldah, the\r\n     prophetess, about the book of laws discovered in the temple, they\r\n     found Huldah in the college in Jerusalem, thoroughly well informed\r\n     on questions of state, while Shallum, her husband, was keeper of\r\n     the robes. I suppose his business was to sew on the royal buttons.'\r\n     But in spite of this Scriptural authority, the rich lady gave\r\n     thirty thousand dollars to Princeton and never one cent for the\r\n     education of her own sex.\r\n\r\n     \"Of all the voices to which these walls have echoed for over half a\r\n     century, how few remain to tell the story of the early days, and\r\n     when we part, how few of us will ever meet again; but I know we\r\n     shall carry with us some new inspiration for the work that still\r\n     remains for us to do. Though many of us are old in years, we may\r\n     still be young in heart. Women trained to concentrate all their\r\n     thoughts on family life are apt to think--when their children are\r\n     grown up, their loved ones gone, their servants trained to keep the\r\n     domestic machinery in motion--that their work in life is done, that\r\n     no one needs now their thought and care, quite forgetting that the\r\n     hey-day of woman's life is on the shady side of fifty, when the\r\n     vital forces heretofore expended in other ways are garnered in the\r\n     brain, when their thoughts and sentiments flow out in broader\r\n     channels, when philanthropy takes the place of family selfishness,\r\n     and when from the depths of poverty and suffering the wail of\r\n     humanity grows as pathetic to their ears as once was the cry of\r\n     their own children.\r\n\r\n     \"Or, perhaps, the pressing cares of family life ended, the woman\r\n     may awake to some slumbering genius in herself for art, science, or\r\n     literature, with which to gild the sunset of her life. Longfellow's\r\n     beautiful poem, 'Morituri Salutamus,' written for a similar\r\n     occasion to this, is full of hope and promise for all of us. He\r\n     says:\r\n\r\n    \"'Something remains for us to do or dare;\r\n    Even the oldest tree some fruit may bear.\r\n    Cato learned Greek at eighty; Sophocles\r\n    Wrote his grand Oedipus, and Simonides\r\n    Bore off the prize of verse from his compeers,\r\n    When each had numbered more than four-score years.\r\n    And Theophrastus, at three-score and ten,\r\n    Had but begun his Characters of Men;\r\n    Chaucer, at Woodstock with the nightingales,\r\n    At sixty wrote the Canterbury Tales;\r\n    Goethe at Weimar, toiling to the last,\r\n    Completed Faust when eighty years were past.\r\n    These are indeed exceptions; but they show\r\n    How far the gulf-stream of our youth may flow\r\n    Into the Arctic regions of our lives,\r\n    Where little else than life itself survives.\r\n    For age is opportunity no less\r\n    Than youth itself, though in another dress,\r\n    And as the evening twilight fades away\r\n    The sky is filled with stars, invisible by day.'\"\r\n\r\nOn December 21, 1892, we celebrated, for the first time, \"Foremothers'\r\nDay.\" Men had celebrated \"Forefathers' Day\" for many years, but as women\r\nwere never invited to join in their festivities, Mrs. Devereux Blake\r\nintroduced the custom of women having a dinner in celebration of that\r\nday. Mrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker spent two days with me, and together\r\nwe attended the feast and made speeches. This custom is now annually\r\nobserved, and gentlemen sit in the gallery just as ladies had done on\r\nsimilar occasions.\r\n\r\nMy son Theodore arrived from France in April, 1893, to attend the\r\nChicago Exposition, and spent most of the summer with me at Glen Cove,\r\nLong Island, where my son Gerrit and his wife were domiciled. Here we\r\nread Captain Charles King's stories of life at military posts, Sanborn's\r\n\"Biography of Bronson Alcott,\" and Lecky's \"History of Rationalism.\"\r\n\r\nHere I visited Charles A. Dana, the Nestor of journalism, and his\r\ncharming family. He lived on a beautiful island near Glen Cove. His\r\nrefined, artistic taste, shown in his city residence in paintings,\r\nstatuary, and rare bric-a-brac, collected in his frequent travels in the\r\nOld World, displayed itself in his island home in the arrangement of an\r\nendless variety of trees, shrubs, and flowers, through which you caught\r\nglimpses of the Sound and distant shores. One seldom meets so gifted a\r\nman as the late editor of the _Sun_. He was a scholar, speaking several\r\nlanguages; an able writer and orator, and a most genial companion in the\r\nsocial circle. His wife and daughter are cultivated women. The name of\r\nthis daughter, Zoe Dana Underhill, often appears in our popular\r\nmagazines as the author of short stories, remarkable for their vivid\r\ndescriptions.\r\n\r\nI met Mr. Dana for the first time at the Brook Farm Community in 1843,\r\nin that brilliant circle of Boston transcendentalists, who hoped in a\r\nfew years to transform our selfish, competitive civilization into a\r\nParadise where all the altruistic virtues might make co-operation\r\npossible. But alas! the material at hand was not sufficiently plastic\r\nfor that higher ideal. In due time the community dissolved and the\r\nmembers returned to their ancestral spheres. Margaret Fuller, who was a\r\nfrequent visitor there, betook herself to matrimony in sunny Italy,\r\nWilliam Henry Channing to the Church, Bronson Alcott to the education of\r\nthe young, Frank Cabot to the world of work, Mr. and Mrs. Ripley to\r\nliterature, and Charles A. Dana to the press. Mr. Dana was very\r\nfortunate in his family relations. His wife, Miss Eunice MacDaniel, and\r\nher relatives sympathized with him in all his most liberal opinions.\r\nDuring the summer at Glen Cove I had the pleasure of several long\r\nconversations with Miss Frances L. MacDaniel and her brother Osborne,\r\nwhose wife is the sister of Mr. Dana, and who is now assisting Miss\r\nPrestona Mann in trying an experiment, similar to the one at Brook Farm,\r\nin the Adirondacks.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony spent a week with us in Glen Cove. She came to stir me up\r\nto write papers for every Congress at the Exposition, which I did, and\r\nshe read them in the different Congresses, adding her own strong words\r\nat the close. Mrs. Russell Sage also came and spent a day with us to\r\nurge me to write a paper to be read at Chicago at the Emma Willard\r\nReunion, which I did. A few days afterward Theodore and I returned her\r\nvisit. We enjoyed a few hours' conversation with Mr Sage, who had made\r\na very generous gift of a building to the Emma Willard Seminary at\r\nTroy. This school was one of the first established (1820) for girls in\r\nour State, and received an appropriation from the New York legislature\r\non the recommendation of the Governor, De Witt Clinton. Mr. Sage gave us\r\na description that night of the time his office was blown up with\r\ndynamite thrown by a crank, and of his narrow escape. We found the great\r\nfinancier and his wife in an unpretending cottage with a fine outlook on\r\nthe sea. Though possessed of great wealth they set a good example of\r\nsimplicity and economy, which many extravagant people would do well to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nHaving visited the World's Exposition at Chicago and attended a course\r\nof lectures at Chautauqua, my daughter, Mrs. Stanton Lawrence, returned\r\nto the city, and as soon as our apartment was in order I joined her. She\r\nhad recently been appointed Director of Physical Training at the\r\nTeachers' College in New York city. I attended several of her\r\nexhibitions and lectures, which were very interesting. She is doing her\r\nbest to develop, with proper exercises and sanitary dress, a new type of\r\nwomanhood.\r\n\r\nMy time passed pleasantly these days with a drive in the Park and an\r\nhour in the land of Nod, also in reading Henry George's \"Progress and\r\nPoverty,\" William Morris on industrial questions, Stevenson's novels,\r\nthe \"Heavenly Twins,\" and \"Marcella,\" and at twilight, when I could not\r\nsee to read and write, in playing and singing the old tunes and songs I\r\nloved in my youth. In the evening we played draughts and chess. I am\r\nfond of all games, also of music and novels, hence the days fly swiftly\r\nby; I am never lonely, life is ever very sweet to me and full of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1893-94 was full of excitement, as the citizens of New\r\nYork were to hold a Constitutional Convention. Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi\r\nendeavored to rouse a new class of men and women to action in favor of\r\nan amendment granting to women the right to vote. Appeals were sent\r\nthroughout the State, gatherings were held in parlors, and enthusiastic\r\nmeetings in Cooper Institute and at the Savoy Hotel. My daughter, Mrs.\r\nStanton Blatch, who was visiting this country, took an active part in\r\nthe canvass, and made an eloquent speech in Cooper Institute. Strange to\r\nsay, some of the leading ladies formed a strong party against the\r\nproposed amendment and their own enfranchisement. They were called the\r\n\"Antis.\" This opposing organization adopted the same plan for the\r\ncampaign as those in favor of the amendment. They issued appeals,\r\ncirculated petitions, and had hearings before the Convention.\r\n\r\nMrs. Russell Sage, Mrs. Henry M. Sanders, Mrs. Edward Lauterbach, Mrs.\r\nRunkle, and some liberal clergymen did their uttermost to secure the\r\ninsertion of the amendment in the proposed new constitution, but the\r\nCommittee on Suffrage of the Constitutional Convention refused even to\r\nsubmit the proposed amendment to a vote of the people, though half a\r\nmillion of our most intelligent and respectable citizens had signed the\r\npetition requesting them to do so. Joseph H. Choate and Elihu Root did\r\ntheir uttermost to defeat the amendment, and succeeded.\r\n\r\nI spent the summer of 1894 with my son Gerrit, in his home at Thomaston,\r\nLong Island. Balzac's novels, and the \"Life of Thomas Paine\" by Moncure\r\nD. Conway, with the monthly magazines and daily papers, were my mental\r\npabulum. My daughter, Mrs. Stanton Lawrence, returned from England in\r\nSeptember, 1894, having had a pleasant visit with her sister in\r\nBasingstoke. In December Miss Anthony came, and we wrote the woman\r\nsuffrage article for the new edition of Johnson's Cyclopedia.\r\n\r\nOn March 3, 1895, Lady Somerset and Miss Frances Willard, on the eve of\r\ntheir departure for England, called to see me. We discussed my project\r\nof a \"Woman's Bible.\" They consented to join a revising committee, but\r\nbefore the committee was organized they withdrew their names, fearing\r\nthe work would be too radical. I especially desired to have the opinions\r\nof women from all sects, but those belonging to the orthodox churches\r\ndeclined to join the committee or express their views. Perhaps they\r\nfeared their faith might be disturbed by the strong light of\r\ninvestigation. Some half dozen members of the Revising Committee began\r\nwith me to write \"Comments on the Pentateuch.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief thought revolving in my mind during the years of 1894 and 1895\r\nhad been \"The Woman's Bible.\" In talking with friends I began to feel\r\nthat I might realize my long-cherished plan. Accordingly, I began to\r\nread the commentators on the Bible and was surprised to see how little\r\nthey had to say about the greatest factor in civilization, the mother of\r\nthe race, and that little by no means complimentary. The more I read,\r\nthe more keenly I felt the importance of convincing women that the\r\nHebrew mythology had no special claim to a higher origin than that of\r\nthe Greeks, being far less attractive in style and less refined in\r\nsentiment. Its objectionable features would long ago have been apparent\r\nhad they not been glossed over with a faith in their divine inspiration.\r\nFor several months I devoted all my time to Biblical criticism and\r\necclesiastical history, and found no explanation for the degraded status\r\nof women under all religions, and in all the so-called \"Holy Books.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Part I. of \"The Woman's Bible\" was finally published in November,\r\n1895, it created a great sensation. Some of the New York city papers\r\ngave a page to its review, with pictures of the commentators, of its\r\ncritics, and even of the book itself. The clergy denounced it as the\r\nwork of Satan, though it really was the work of Ellen Battelle Dietrick,\r\nLillie Devereux Blake, Rev. Phebe A. Hanaford, Clara Bewick Colby,\r\nUrsula N. Gestefeld, Louisa Southworth, Frances Ellen Burr, and myself.\r\nExtracts from it, and criticisms of the commentators, were printed in\r\nthe newspapers throughout America, Great Britain, and Europe. A third\r\nedition was found necessary, and finally an edition was published in\r\nEngland. The Revising Committee was enlarged, and it now consists of\r\nover thirty of the leading women of America and Europe.[A]\r\n\r\nThe month of August, 1895, we spent in Peterboro, on the grand hills of\r\nMadison County, nine hundred feet above the valley. Gerrit Smith's fine\r\nold mansion still stands, surrounded with magnificent trees, where I had\r\nplayed in childhood, chasing squirrels over lawn and gardens and wading\r\nin a modest stream that still creeps slowly round the grounds. I\r\nrecalled as I sat on the piazza how one time, when Frederick Douglass\r\ncame to spend a few days at Peterboro, some Southern visitors wrote a\r\nnote to Mr. Smith asking if Mr. Douglass was to sit in the parlor and at\r\nthe dining table; if so, during his visit they would remain in their\r\nown apartments. Mr. Smith replied that his visitors were always treated\r\nby his family as equals, and such would be the case with Mr. Douglass,\r\nwho was considered one of the ablest men reared under \"The Southern\r\nInstitution.\" So these ladies had their meals in their own apartments,\r\nwhere they stayed most of the time, and, as Mr. Douglass prolonged his\r\nvisit, they no doubt wished in their hearts that they had never taken\r\nthat silly position. The rest of us walked about with him, arm in arm,\r\nplayed games, and sang songs together, he playing the accompaniment on\r\nthe guitar. I suppose if our prejudiced countrywomen had been introduced\r\nto Dumas in a French salon, they would at once have donned their bonnets\r\nand ran away.\r\n\r\nSitting alone under the trees I recalled the different generations that\r\nhad passed away, all known to me. Here I had met the grandfather, Peter\r\nSken Smith, partner of John Jacob Astor. In their bargains with the\r\nIndians they acquired immense tracts of land in the Northern part of the\r\nState of New York, which were the nucleus of their large fortunes. I\r\nhave often heard Cousin Gerrit complain of the time he lost managing the\r\nestate. His son Greene was an enthusiast in the natural sciences and\r\ntook but little interest in property matters. Later, his grandson,\r\nGerrit Smith Miller, assumed the burden of managing the estate and, in\r\naddition, devoted himself to agriculture. He imported a fine breed of\r\nHolstein cattle, which have taken the first prize at several fairs. His\r\nson, bearing the same name, is devoted to the natural sciences, like his\r\nuncle Greene; whose fine collection of birds was presented by his widow\r\nto Harvard College.\r\n\r\nThe only daughter of Gerrit Smith, Elizabeth Smith Miller, is a\r\nremarkable woman, possessing many of the traits of her noble father. She\r\nhas rare executive ability, as shown in the dispatch of her extensive\r\ncorrespondence and in the perfect order of her house and grounds. She\r\nhas done much in the way of education, especially for the colored race,\r\nin helping to establish schools and in distributing literature. She\r\nsubscribes for many of the best books, periodicals, and papers for\r\nfriends not able to purchase for themselves. We cannot estimate the good\r\nshe has done in this way. Every mail brings her letters from all\r\nclasses, from charitable institutions, prisons, Southern plantations,\r\narmy posts, and the far-off prairies. To all these pleas for help she\r\ngives a listening ear. Her charities are varied and boundless, and her\r\nhospitalities to the poor as well as the rich, courteous and generous.\r\nThe refinement and artistic taste of the Southern mother and the heroic\r\nvirtues of the father are happily blended in their daughter. In her\r\nbeautiful home on Seneca Lake, one is always sure to meet some of the\r\nmost charming representatives of the progressive thought of our times.\r\nRepresentatives of all these generations now rest in the cemetery at\r\nPeterboro, and as in review they passed before me they seemed to say,\r\n\"Why linger you here alone so long?\"\r\n\r\nMy son Theodore arrived from Paris in September, 1895, and rendered most\r\nimportant service during the preparations for my birthday celebration,\r\nin answering letters, talking with reporters, and making valuable\r\nsuggestions to the managers as to many details in the arrangements, and\r\nencouraging me to go through the ordeal with my usual heroism. I never\r\nfelt so nervous in my life, and so unfitted for the part I was in duty\r\nbound to perform. From much speaking through many years my voice was\r\nhoarse, from a severe fall I was quite lame, and as standing, and\r\ndistinct speaking are important to graceful oratory, I felt like the\r\nking's daughter in Shakespeare's play of \"Titus Andronicus,\" when rude\r\nmen who had cut her hands off and her tongue out, told her to call for\r\nwater and wash her hands. However, I lived through the ordeal, as the\r\nreader will see in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nAfter my birthday celebration, the next occasion of deep interest to me\r\nwas the Chicago Convention of 1896, the platform there adopted, and the\r\nnomination and brilliant campaign of William J. Bryan. I had long been\r\nrevolving in my mind questions relating to the tariff and finance, and\r\nin the demands of liberal democrats, populists, socialists, and the\r\nlaboring men and women, I heard the clarion notes of the coming\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1895-96 I was busy writing alternately on this\r\nautobiography and \"The Woman's Bible,\" and articles for magazines and\r\njournals on every possible subject from Venezuela and Cuba to the\r\nbicycle. On the latter subject many timid souls were greatly distressed.\r\nShould women ride? What should they wear? What are \"God's intentions\"\r\nconcerning them? Should they ride on Sunday? These questions were asked\r\nwith all seriousness. We had a symposium on these points in one of the\r\ndaily papers. To me the answer to all these questions was simple--if\r\nwoman could ride, it was evidently \"God's intention\" that she be\r\npermitted to do so. As to what she should wear, she must decide what is\r\nbest adapted to her comfort and convenience. Those who prefer a spin of\r\na few hours on a good road in the open air to a close church and a dull\r\nsermon, surely have the right to choose, whether with trees and flowers\r\nand singing birds to worship in \"That temple not made with hands,\r\neternal in the heavens,\" or within four walls to sleep during the\r\nintonation of that melancholy service that relegates us all, without\r\ndistinction of sex or color, to the ranks of \"miserable sinners.\" Let\r\neach one do what seemeth right in her own eyes, provided she does not\r\nencroach on the rights of others.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1896, I again went to Geneva and found the bicycle craze had\r\nreached there, with all its most pronounced symptoms; old and young,\r\nprofessors, clergymen, and ladies of fashion were all spinning merrily\r\naround on business errands, social calls, and excursions to distant\r\ntowns. Driving down the avenue one day, we counted eighty bicycles\r\nbefore reaching the post-office. The ancient bandbox, so detested by our\r\nsires and sons, has given place to this new machine which our daughters\r\ntake with them wheresoever they go, boxing and unboxing and readjusting\r\nfor each journey. It has been a great blessing to our girls in\r\ncompelling them to cultivate their self-reliance and their mechanical\r\ningenuity, as they are often compelled to mend the wheel in case of\r\naccident. Among the visitors at Geneva were Mr. Douglass and his\r\ndaughter from the island of Cuba. They gave us very sad accounts of the\r\ndesolate state of the island and the impoverished condition of the\r\npeople. I had long felt that the United States should interfere in some\r\nway to end that cruel warfare, for Spain has proved that she is\r\nincompetent to restore order and peace.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Part II. of \"The Woman's Bible,\" which completes the work,\r\nwill be issued in January, 1898.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nMY EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout my knowledge or consent, my lifelong friend, Susan B. Anthony,\r\nwho always seems to appreciate homage tendered to me more highly than\r\neven to herself, made arrangements for the celebration of my eightieth\r\nbirthday, on the 12th day of November, 1895. She preferred that this\r\ncelebration should be conducted by the National Council of Women,\r\ncomposed of a large number of organizations representing every\r\ndepartment of woman's labor, though, as the enfranchisement of woman had\r\nbeen my special life work, it would have been more appropriate if the\r\ncelebration had been under the auspices of the National Woman's Suffrage\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary Lowe Dickinson, President of the National Council of Women,\r\nassumed the financial responsibility and the extensive correspondence\r\ninvolved, and with rare tact, perseverance, and executive ability made\r\nthe celebration a complete success. In describing this occasion I cannot\r\ndo better than to reproduce, in part, Mrs. Dickinson's account,\r\npublished in _The Arena_:\r\n\r\n\"In the month of June, 1895, the National Council of Women issued the\r\nfollowing invitation:\r\n\r\n\"'Believing that the progress made by women in the last half century may\r\nbe promoted by a more general notice of their achievements, we propose\r\nto hold, in New York city, a convention for this purpose. As an\r\nappropriate time for such a celebration, the eightieth birthday of\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton has been chosen. Her half century of pioneer work\r\nfor the rights of women makes her name an inspiration for such an\r\noccasion and her life a fitting object for the homage of all women.\r\n\r\n\"'This National Council is composed of twenty organizations; these and\r\nall other societies interested are invited to co-operate in grateful\r\nrecognition of the debt the present generation owes to the pioneers of\r\nthe past. From their interest in the enfranchisement of women, the\r\ninfluence of Mrs. Stanton and her coadjutor, Miss Anthony, has permeated\r\nall departments of progress and made them a common center round which\r\nall interested in woman's higher development may gather.'\r\n\r\n\"To this invitation came responses, from the Old World and the New,\r\nexpressing sympathy with the proposed celebration, which was intended to\r\nemphasize a great principle by showing the loftiness of character that\r\nhad resulted from its embodiment in a unique personality. The world\r\nnaturally thinks of the personality before it thinks of the principle.\r\nIt has, at least, so much unconscious courtesy left as to honor a noble\r\nwoman, even when failing to rightly apprehend a noble cause. To afford\r\nthis feeling its proper expression, to render more tangible all vague\r\nsympathy, to crystallize the growing sentiment in favor of human\r\nfreedom, to give youth the opportunity to reverence the glory of age, to\r\ngive hearts their utterances in word and song was perhaps the most\r\npopular purpose of the reunion. In other words, it gave an opportunity\r\nfor those who revered Mrs. Stanton as a queen among women to show their\r\nreverence, and to recognize the work her life had wrought, and to see in\r\nit an epitome of the progress of a century.\r\n\r\n\"The celebration was also an illustration of the distinctive idea of the\r\nNational Council of Women, which aims to give recognition to all human\r\neffort without demanding uniformity of opinion as a basis of\r\nco-operation. It claims to act upon a unity of service, notwithstanding\r\ndifferences of creed and methods. The things that separate, shrank back\r\ninto the shadows where they belong, and all hearts brave enough to\r\nthink, and tender enough to feel, found it easy to unite in homage to a\r\nlife which had known a half century of struggle to lift humanity from\r\nbondage and womanhood from shame.\r\n\r\n\"This reunion was the first general recognition of the debt the present\r\nowes to the past. It was the first effort to show the extent to which\r\nlater development has been inspired and made possible by the freedom to\r\nthink and work claimed in that earlier time by women like Lucretia Mott,\r\nLucy Stone, Mrs. Stanton, and many others whose names stand as synonyms\r\nof noble service for the race. To those who looked at the reunion from\r\nthis point of view it could not fail of inspiration.\r\n\r\n\"For the followers in lines of philanthropic work to look in the faces\r\nand hear the voices of women like Clara Barton and Mary Livermore; for\r\nthe multitude enlisted in the crowded ranks of literature to feel in the\r\nliving presence, what literature owes to women like Julia Ward Howe; for\r\nthe white ribbon army to turn from its one great leader of to-day whose\r\nlight, spreading to the horizon, does not obscure or dim the glory of\r\nthe crusade leaders of the past; for art lovers and art students to\r\ncall to mind sculptors like Harriet Hosmer and Anna Whitney, and\r\nremember the days when art was a sealed book to women; for the followers\r\nof the truly divine art of healing to honor the Blackwell sisters and\r\nthe memory of Mme. Clemence Lozier; for the mercy of surgery to reveal\r\nitself in the face of Dr. Cushier, who has proved for us that heart of\r\npity and hand of skill need never be divorced; for women lifting their\r\neyes to meet the face of Phebe A. Hanaford and Anna Shaw and other women\r\nwho to-day in the pulpit, as well as out of it, may use a woman's right\r\nto minister to needy souls; for the ofttime sufferers from unrighteous\r\nlaw to welcome women lawyers; for the throng of working women to read\r\nbackward through the story of four hundred industries to their beginning\r\nin the 'four,' and remember that each new door had opened because some\r\nwomen toiled and strove; for all these the exercises were a part of a\r\ngreat thanksgiving paean, each phase of progress striking its own chord,\r\nand finding each its echo in the hearts that held it dear.\r\n\r\n\"To the student of history, or to him who can read the signs of the\r\ntimes, there was such a profound significance in this occasion as makes\r\none shrink from dwelling too much upon the external details. Yet as a\r\npageant only it was a most inspiring sight, and one truly worthy of a\r\nqueen. Indeed as we run the mind back over the pages of history, what\r\nqueen came to a more triumphant throne in the hearts of a grateful\r\npeople? What woman ever before sat silver-crowned, canopied with\r\nflowers, surrounded not by servile followers but by men and women who\r\nbrought to her court the grandest service they had wrought, their best\r\nthought crystallized in speech and song. Greater than any triumphal\r\nprocession that ever marked a royal passage through a kingdom was it to\r\nknow that in a score or more of cities, in many a village church on that\r\nsame night festive fires were lighted, and the throng kept holiday,\r\nbringing for tribute not gold and gems but noblest aspirations, truest\r\ngratitude, and highest ideals for the nation and the race.\r\n\r\n\"The great meeting was but one link in a chain; yet with its thousands\r\nof welcoming faces, with its eloquence of words, with its offering of\r\nsweetest song from the children of a race that once was bound but now is\r\nfree, with its pictured glimpses of the old time and the new flashing\r\nout upon the night, with the home voices offering welcome and gratitude\r\nand love, with numberless greetings, from the great, true, brave souls\r\nof many lands, it was indeed a wonderful tribute, worthy of the great\r\nwarm heart of a nation that offered it, and worthy of the woman so\r\nrevered.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed fitting that Mme. Antoinette Sterling, who, twenty years ago,\r\ntook her wonderful voice away to England, where it won for her a unique\r\nplace in the hearts of the nation, should, on returning to her country,\r\ngive her first service to the womanhood of her native land. 'I am coming\r\na week earlier,' so she had written, 'that my first work in my own\r\nbeloved America may be done for women. I am coming as a woman and not as\r\nan artist, and because I so glory in that which the women of my country\r\nhave achieved.' So when she sang out of her heart, 'O rest in the Lord;\r\nwait patiently for him!' no marvel that it seemed to lift all listening\r\nhearts to a recognition of the divine secret and source of power for all\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\"One charming feature of the entertainment was a series of pictures\r\ncalled 'Then and Now,' each illustrating the change in woman's condition\r\nduring the last fifty years. And after this, upon the dimness there\r\nshone out, one after another, the names of noble women like Mary Lyon,\r\nMaria Mitchell, Emma Willard, and many others who have passed away. Upon\r\nthe shadows and the silence broke Mme. Sterling's voice in Tennyson's\r\n'Crossing the Bar.' And when this was over, as with one voice, the whole\r\naudience sang softly 'Auld Lang Syne.'\r\n\r\n\"And last but not least should be mentioned the greetings that poured in\r\na shower of telegrams and letters from every section of the country, and\r\nmany from over the sea. These expressions, not only of personal\r\ncongratulation for Mrs. Stanton, but utterances of gladness for the\r\nprogress in woman's life and thought, for the conditions, already so\r\nmuch better than in the past, and for the hope for the future, would\r\nmake of themselves a most interesting and wonderful chapter. Among them\r\nmay be mentioned letters from Lord and Lady Aberdeen, from Lady Henry\r\nSomerset and Frances E. Willard, from Canon Wilberforce, and many\r\nothers, including an address from thirty members of the family of John\r\nBright, headed by his brother, the Right Honorable Jacob Bright; a\r\nbeautifully engrossed address, on parchment, from the National Woman\r\nSuffrage Society of Scotland, an address from the London Women's\r\nFranchise League, and a cablegram from the Bristol Women's Liberal\r\nAssociation; a letter from the Women's Rights Society of Finland, signed\r\nby its president, Baroness Gripenberg of Helsingfors; telegrams from the\r\nCalifornia Suffrage Pioneers; and others from the Chicago Woman's Club,\r\nfrom the Toledo and Ohio Woman's Suffrage Society, from the son of the\r\nRev. Dr. William Ellery Channing, and a telegram and letter from\r\ncitizens and societies of Seneca Falls, New York, accompanied with\r\nflowers and many handsome pieces of silver from the different societies.\r\nThere were also letters from Hon. Oscar S. Strauss, ex-minister to\r\nTurkey, Miss Ellen Terry, and scores of others. An address was received\r\nfrom the Women's Association of Utah, accompanied by a beautiful onyx\r\nand silver ballot box; and from the Shaker women of Mount Lebanon came\r\nan ode; a solid silver loving cup from the New York City Suffrage\r\nLeague, presented on the platform with a few appropriate words by its\r\nPresident, Mrs. Devereux Blake.\r\n\r\n\"Hundreds of organizations and societies, both in this country and\r\nabroad, wished to have their names placed on record as in sympathy with\r\nthe movement. Many organizations were present in a body, and one was\r\nreminded, by the variety and beauty of the decorations of their boxes,\r\nof the Venetian Carnival, as the occupants gazed down from amid the\r\nsilken banners and the flowers, upon the throng below. The whole\r\noccasion was indeed a unique festival, unique in its presentation, as\r\nwell as in its purpose, plan, character, and spirit. No woman present\r\ncould fail to be impressed with what we owe to the women of the past,\r\nand especially to this one woman who was the honored guest of the\r\noccasion. And no young woman could desire to forget the picture of this\r\naged form as, leaning upon her staff, Mrs. Stanton spoke to the great\r\naudience of over six thousand, as she had spoken hundreds of times\r\nbefore in legislative halls, and whenever her word could influence the\r\npopular sentiment in favor of justice for all mankind.\"\r\n\r\nMy birthday celebration, with all the testimonials of love and\r\nfriendship I received, was an occasion of such serious thought and deep\r\nfeeling as I had never before experienced. Having been accustomed for\r\nhalf a century to blame rather than praise, I was surprised with such a\r\nmanifestation of approval; I could endure any amount of severe criticism\r\nwith complacency, but such an outpouring of homage and affection stirred\r\nme profoundly. To calm myself during that week of excitement, I thought\r\nmany times of Michelet's wise motto, \"Let the weal and woe of humanity\r\nbe everything to you, their praise and blame of no effect; be not puffed\r\nup with the one nor cast down with the other.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally at such a time I reviewed my life, its march and battle on the\r\nhighways of experience, and counted its defeats and victories. I\r\nremembered when a few women called the first convention to discuss their\r\ndisabilities, that our conservative friends said: \"You have made a great\r\nmistake, you will be laughed at from Maine to Texas and beyond the sea;\r\nGod has set the bounds of woman's sphere and she should be satisfied\r\nwith her position.\" Their prophecy was more than realized; we were\r\nunsparingly ridiculed by the press and pulpit both in England and\r\nAmerica. But now many conventions are held each year in both countries\r\nto discuss the same ideas; social customs have changed; laws have been\r\nmodified; municipal suffrage has been granted to women in England and\r\nsome of her colonies; school suffrage has been granted to women in half\r\nof our States, municipal suffrage in Kansas, and full suffrage in four\r\nStates of the Union. Thus the principle scouted in 1848 was accepted in\r\nEngland in 1870, and since then, year by year, it has slowly progressed\r\nin America until the fourth star shone out on our flag in 1896, and\r\nIdaho enfranchised her women! That first convention, considered a \"grave\r\nmistake\" in 1848, is now referred to as \"a grand step in progress.\"\r\n\r\nMy next mistake was when, as president of the New York State Woman's\r\nTemperance Association, I demanded the passage of a statute allowing\r\nwives an absolute divorce for the brutality and intemperance of their\r\nhusbands. I addressed the Legislature of New York a few years later when\r\na similar bill was pending, and also large audiences in several of our\r\nchief cities, and for this I was severely denounced. To-day fugitives\r\nfrom such unholy ties can secure freedom in many of the Western States,\r\nand enlightened public sentiment sustains mothers in refusing to hand\r\ndown an appetite fraught with so many evil consequences. This, also\r\ncalled a \"mistake\" in 1860, was regarded as a \"step in progress\" a few\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\nAgain, I urged my coadjutors by speeches, letters, and resolutions, as a\r\nmeans of widespread agitation, to make the same demands of the Church\r\nthat we had already made of the State. They objected, saying, \"That is\r\ntoo revolutionary, an attack on the Church would injure the suffrage\r\nmovement.\" But I steadily made the demand, as opportunity offered, that\r\nwomen be ordained to preach the Gospel and to fill the offices as\r\nelders, deacons, and trustees. A few years later some of these\r\nsuggestions were accepted. Some churches did ordain women as pastors\r\nover congregations of their own, others elected women deaconesses, and a\r\nfew churches allowed women, as delegates, to sit in their conferences.\r\nThus this demand was in a measure honored and another \"step in\r\nprogress\" taken.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 I tried to organize a committee to consider the status of women\r\nin the Bible, and the claim that the Hebrew Writings were the result of\r\ndivine inspiration. It was thought very presumptuous for women not\r\nlearned in languages and ecclesiastical history to undertake such work.\r\nBut as we merely proposed to comment on what was said of women in plain\r\nEnglish, and found these texts composed only one-tenth of the Old and\r\nNew Testaments, it did not seem to me a difficult or dangerous\r\nundertaking. However, when Part I. of \"The Woman's Bible\" was published,\r\nagain there was a general disapproval by press and pulpit, and even by\r\nwomen themselves, expressed in resolutions in suffrage and temperance\r\nconventions. Like other \"mistakes,\" this too, in due time, will be\r\nregarded as \"a step in progress.\"\r\n\r\nSuch experiences have given me confidence in my judgment, and patience\r\nwith the opposition of my coadjutors, with whom on so many points I\r\ndisagree. It requires no courage now to demand the right of suffrage,\r\ntemperance legislation, liberal divorce laws, or for women to fill\r\nchurch offices--these battles have been fought and won and the principle\r\ngoverning these demands conceded. But it still requires courage to\r\nquestion the divine inspiration of the Hebrew Writings as to the\r\nposition of woman. Why should the myths, fables, and allegories of the\r\nHebrews be held more sacred than those of the Assyrians and Egyptians,\r\nfrom whose literature most of them were derived? Seeing that the\r\nreligious superstitions of women perpetuate their bondage more than all\r\nother adverse influences, I feel impelled to reiterate my demands for\r\njustice, liberty, and equality in the Church as well as in the State.\r\n\r\nThe birthday celebration was to me more than a beautiful pageant; more\r\nthan a personal tribute. It was the dawn of a new day for the Mothers of\r\nthe Race! The harmonious co-operation of so many different\r\norganizations, with divers interests and opinions, in one grand jubilee\r\nwas, indeed, a heavenly vision of peace and hope; a prophecy that with\r\nthe exaltation of Womanhood would come new Life, Light, and Liberty to\r\nall mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF NAMES.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\nAberdeen, _Lord_ and _Lady_,\r\nAddington, Laura,\r\nAlbert, _Prince_,\r\nAlcott, A.
